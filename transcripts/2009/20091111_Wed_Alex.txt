[00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.182]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.182 --> 00:00:11.742]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:12.663]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.663 --> 00:00:17.506]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:21.568]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:46.442]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this 11th day of November, this Wednesday, the 11th day of November 2009.
[00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:53.793]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:53.793 --> 00:01:07.641]  In the last hour and a half today, we're going to have Dr. Sherry Tinpenny in studio, fresh off a debate yesterday at the University of Texas against a pro-vaccine advocate.
[00:01:09.616 --> 00:01:21.525]  We'll be going over the latest information concerning the forced inoculation program going on covertly in public schools against helpless and defenseless elementary school students.
[00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:32.413]  The government only targets small children just like child molesters target small children because they have trouble telling the story and don't, aren't believed.
[00:01:32.413 --> 00:01:35.476]  We're going to be discussing how the predators are targeting the children.
[00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:51.463]  We're going to be discussing an article up on PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Watson with Desiree Jennings, the cheerleader from Washington, D.C.
[00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:54.344]  John Hopkins said she clearly had a neuro
[00:01:55.788 --> 00:01:56.369]  Disease
[00:02:13.522 --> 00:02:15.383]  After all, it's in the drug insert.
[00:02:15.383 --> 00:02:16.304]  They admit it.
[00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:17.965]  That it can cause this.
[00:02:17.965 --> 00:02:22.448]  And of course they had to suspend similar injections in 76 due to this problem.
[00:02:22.448 --> 00:02:28.052]  But there is a disinformation campaign in the media with zero evidence.
[00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:37.199]  Zero evidence just saying it's a hoax because Desiree Jennings got national attention.
[00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.599]  And so Jenny McCarthy's
[00:02:39.862 --> 00:02:51.026]  Foundation got her in touch with top medical doctors, friends of Dr. Rima Labo by the way, who know how to do very serious chelation.
[00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:57.748]  It can also be dangerous because it strips your body of a lot of other things you need and she's going through those treatments and is getting better.
[00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:11.301]  By the way, I'm not saying take vaccines, but that's also what the FDA states is that, oh, don't worry if you do have seizures or get paralyzed or have convulsions or lose feeling in your hands and feet.
[00:03:11.301 --> 00:03:13.863]  It normally comes back, and it does normally come back.
[00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:26.542]  In fact, I've got newscast after newscast after newscast where they go, don't worry, you know, this fella got a flu shot and now is in a wheelchair, but doctors say he should get control over his body back soon.
[00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:34.807]  The inflammation in his brain and brain stem and spinal cord should dissipate in the next few months.
[00:03:34.807 --> 00:03:41.071]  So the doctor is attacking Desiree Jennings, saying, oh, she made it all up.
[00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:42.512]  You know, how is she getting better now?
[00:03:44.192 --> 00:03:48.733]  They know full well that most of the time you do get better.
[00:03:48.733 --> 00:03:55.235]  Now it tends to come back as different neurological diseases later.
[00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:59.136]  The list is long.
[00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:03.737]  So let's hope it doesn't come back with the people that seem to get better.
[00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:05.098]  She's still in a wheelchair.
[00:04:06.152 --> 00:04:09.953]  She's still having convulsions, but it looks like a lot of it's being reversed.
[00:04:09.953 --> 00:04:10.773]  And what do they do?
[00:04:10.773 --> 00:04:12.534]  They viciously come in and attack her.
[00:04:12.534 --> 00:04:14.775]  She went to three separate medical institutions.
[00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:17.175]  They did CAT scans, MRIs.
[00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:21.597]  She clearly has this neurological disorder.
[00:04:21.597 --> 00:04:27.658]  It's certified by the doctors that looked at her at prestigious medical institutions.
[00:04:27.658 --> 00:04:35.481]  But from a distance, doctors in the employ of the vaccine manufacturers, I think they're open to serious
[00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:39.809]  Defamation of character lawsuits.
[00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:50.855]  And I'm not some litigious, you know, sue-happy person, but you start accusing some innocent woman who's been certified to have this disorder caused by the vaccine and the FDA even admits it.
[00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:58.540]  And you're so in love with your deadly vaccines that you come out and call her a liar when it's on the injection insert.
[00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:04.211]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:09.536]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.536 --> 00:05:11.597]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.597 --> 00:05:16.601]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:17.522]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.762 --> 00:05:18.903]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.903 --> 00:05:20.785]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.785 --> 00:05:21.845]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.845 --> 00:05:24.047]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:24.047 --> 00:05:25.388]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:25.388 --> 00:05:26.930]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.194]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:32.194 --> 00:05:35.777]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:39.240]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.821]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:41.721]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:42.821]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:43.762]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.762 --> 00:05:44.842]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.842 --> 00:05:47.903]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.903 --> 00:05:49.664]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.664 --> 00:05:50.584]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:02.108 --> 00:06:06.111]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:09.373]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.373 --> 00:06:14.177]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.177 --> 00:06:20.561]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.561 --> 00:06:22.803]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:23.303 --> 00:06:24.944]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:24.944 --> 00:06:26.065]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:26.065 --> 00:06:28.666]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:30.587]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:30.587 --> 00:06:32.048]  And right now in Washington, D.C.
[00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:49.500]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:58.591]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:03.457]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[00:07:03.457 --> 00:07:05.320]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.102]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[00:07:07.102 --> 00:07:11.087]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[00:07:11.087 --> 00:07:15.632]  Beta Prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.
[00:07:15.632 --> 00:07:20.218]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and intimacy.
[00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:26.062]  Beta Prostate has plant sterols shown to support healthy urine flow and healthy sleeping habits.
[00:07:26.062 --> 00:07:35.150]  And Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 saw paw metal capsules to get the same plant sterols found in one Beta Prostate.
[00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.152]  New customers can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[00:07:38.152 --> 00:07:39.853]  You only pay shipping and handling.
[00:07:39.853 --> 00:07:42.716]  To get your free bottle of Beta Prostate, call 1-800-360-8306.
[00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:42.936]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.421]  This offer is for one free bottle per household.
[00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:54.282]  Call now and try Beta Prostate for free.
[00:07:54.282 --> 00:07:57.284]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[00:07:57.284 --> 00:07:57.784]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[00:07:57.784 --> 00:08:06.327]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.327 --> 00:08:08.588]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:20.774 --> 00:08:37.947]  Remember that the globalists, the illegitimate criminals that control the planet through the issuance of currency and credit, they go pay off politicians, get the governments to give them the sole certification to issue currency and credit.
[00:08:37.947 --> 00:08:42.030]  The bankers then buy up the entire planet.
[00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.052]  And remember, they're making their move right now.
[00:08:44.052 --> 00:08:47.635]  Al Gore, George Soros, German Chancellor Merkel,
[00:08:48.922 --> 00:09:04.698]  Barroso, head of the EU, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, they are all in unison on Lair News Hour and CNN and everywhere else calling for world government.
[00:09:15.063 --> 00:09:19.545]  So all of that is currently being announced and trumpeted.
[00:09:19.545 --> 00:09:37.852]  Open world government is being trumpeted, but a type of psychological compulsion, a type of psychological barrier, a type of psychological conditioning has been engineered into the public.
[00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:41.654]  There has been a literal hypnotic suggestion
[00:09:42.912 --> 00:09:52.178]  That there is no world government, there is no planetary government, there is no private federal reserve, there is no Rothschild family, there are no Rockefellers.
[00:09:52.178 --> 00:09:55.881]  Government corruption is impossible and is a conspiracy theory.
[00:09:57.366 --> 00:10:17.419]  See, they've lowered your political immune system and told you, like telling a child, there are not 18-wheelers driving up and down I-35, there are no cars on that major interstate highway, go at 4 o'clock in the afternoon when there's heavy traffic going at 75 miles an hour and dance in the street.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:25.385]  And you just tell that child that thousands of times, and then finally just turn them loose in the street and they just run out in front of an 18-wheeler.
[00:10:25.385 --> 00:10:26.566]  There is no world government.
[00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:27.827]  There is no corruption.
[00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:30.428]  There is no plan to put troops on the streets of America.
[00:10:30.428 --> 00:10:31.829]  There is no NORTHCOM.
[00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:33.991]  The CIA does not ship in narcotics.
[00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:36.153]  They do not ship in opium.
[00:10:36.153 --> 00:10:41.837]  They do not control Colombia and Afghanistan to ship in over a trillion dollars a year.
[00:10:41.837 --> 00:10:44.799]  500 billion at least of cocaine, 500 billion in heroin.
[00:10:45.359 --> 00:10:48.641]  They do not have secret sites to torture people.
[00:10:48.641 --> 00:10:51.542]  They are not spying on you.
[00:10:51.542 --> 00:10:58.925]  And they just say that over and over and over again and have pundits laughing at people and saying there's no such thing as a new world order.
[00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:06.549]  And then finally they come out and they say, we're surveilling everything you're doing, everything you're writing, everything you're faxing, everything you're emailing.
[00:11:06.549 --> 00:11:08.290]  We're openly setting up world government.
[00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.672]  You will pay your taxes directly to Al Gore.
[00:11:10.672 --> 00:11:11.873]  He is your savior.
[00:11:11.873 --> 00:11:13.735]  He is setting up a global religion.
[00:11:13.735 --> 00:11:14.555]  Bow to it.
[00:11:14.555 --> 00:11:17.117]  You will thumb scan and face scan to buy and sell.
[00:11:17.117 --> 00:11:20.000]  This will go on your carbon credit national ID card.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.143]  You will not be able to own a gun or fly or have a job unless you are in good graces with the government.
[00:11:24.143 --> 00:11:25.184]  There will be no judges.
[00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:26.385]  There will be no juries.
[00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:27.907]  This is extrajudicial.
[00:11:27.907 --> 00:11:28.868]  This is freedom.
[00:11:28.868 --> 00:11:30.389]  Freedom is secretly being arrested.
[00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:33.330]  Freedom is not being able to buy and sell without face scanning.
[00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:51.215]  Freedom is having everything you do tracked and run and having bureaucrats inspect your home every week and having local block captain environmental enforcers who directly report to colonels and generals now in civilian positions over every major city to control the grid.
[00:11:51.215 --> 00:11:51.615]  Freedom
[00:11:52.702 --> 00:12:12.669]  Is having the military industrial complex merge with the prison complex, and merge with the big pharma complex, with the surveillance security complex, and start forced inoculations, forced drugging, total takeover of society, the giant government feeding all your tax money directly into the private institutions that control the government.
[00:12:12.669 --> 00:12:16.371]  Giant total corporate monopolies, total corporate welfare.
[00:12:17.091 --> 00:12:34.695]  The liberals controlling giant hordes of fluoride-head, dumbed-down, public school-educated, just mindless, dangerous hordes to be sicked on anyone who's middle class, anyone that resists the tyranny.
[00:12:34.695 --> 00:12:46.518]  The Republicans, on the other hand, pro-war, pro-death, pro-tyranny, saying that freedom and liberty is launching all these new wars and having the Patriot Act and body scanners everywhere and no freedom.
[00:12:50.049 --> 00:13:09.969]  And the Democrats are just as bad in pro-war, just with different rhetoric.
[00:13:09.969 --> 00:13:12.632]  And so they've come in and implanted
[00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:25.117]  The psychological message through movies and culture and fiction and non-fiction and books just everywhere.
[00:13:25.117 --> 00:13:36.903]  I've seen hundreds and hundreds of TV shows over the years that listeners have sent me clips of where there'll be a bad guy or a murderer or a killer who's raping children or dealing drugs and he'll believe in the New World Order conspiracy theory.
[00:13:36.903 --> 00:13:42.445]  The message is scum, filth, racist, trash, child molesters believe in the world government.
[00:13:46.127 --> 00:13:48.428]  And then now they openly announced the world government.
[00:13:48.428 --> 00:14:04.575]  It's exactly what we told you it was going to be because we were reading their own documents and people have a psychological compulsion to not be able to resist it because it was implanted in their minds and they were conditioned that it didn't exist or you were a racist or you were a kook or you were bad if you talked about it.
[00:14:08.578 --> 00:14:12.804]  You see that the New World Order is run by psychologists, psychiatrists.
[00:14:12.804 --> 00:14:14.706]  They're run by top pitch men.
[00:14:14.706 --> 00:14:19.252]  People that understand anthropology, sociology.
[00:14:19.252 --> 00:14:25.841]  Individuals that understand how the human psyche works and they're bringing us through different layers of programming and control.
[00:14:44.198 --> 00:15:08.139]  And so here we are with completely criminal offshore banks with no constitutional right, no legal right to be doing what they're doing, robbing us completely blind, and the police nationwide and worldwide are given weekly intelligence reports where they mix the term cop killer and Ku Klux Klan in with anyone who doesn't want to have the banks take over.
[00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:15.249]  The MIAC report, the Homeland Security reports, there's literally hundreds of them, and it's all the same mantra.
[00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:21.132]  The first page is about a cop killer, and then the next page is about Ron Paul and people that want to audit the Fed.
[00:15:21.132 --> 00:15:29.596]  I mean, police, do you like being conditioned by such low-level, insultingly simple propaganda?
[00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:33.398]  I mean, that's how dumb they think you are, is they give you third-grader propaganda.
[00:15:36.383 --> 00:15:46.086]  CEOs and wealthy people who aren't really part of the establishment, they're given another grade of propaganda where they're told the truth about a lot of things, but it's all spun.
[00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:53.469]  Well, global government, we have to, you know, help the third world and lower the standard of living of the United States to help the third world.
[00:15:53.469 --> 00:15:57.170]  They don't explain that they're lowering the standard of the third world and the United States.
[00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:05.113]  They don't tell you that it's a vertical integration to create an absolute world monopoly, not just of money and wealth and land and power, but
[00:16:08.047 --> 00:16:14.691]  of the access to true high-tech life extension technologies.
[00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:23.635]  Reservations of high-tech systems have been developed under government and private industry that are being walled off under national security.
[00:16:23.635 --> 00:16:34.882]  And we're being given a form of arrested development in technology, where even though it looks like technology is accelerating very quickly, it's actually advancing very slowly compared to the true advances that have been made in the last 40 years.
[00:16:36.385 --> 00:16:48.807]  And so we're walled off in this false reality of disinformation, our water's poisoned, we're brain damaged by design in official government documents so that we don't have that feverish spark of human...
[00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:56.313]  Creativity and understanding and that spark of human resistance to get out and say no.
[00:16:56.313 --> 00:16:58.374]  They sap our will psychologically.
[00:16:58.374 --> 00:17:03.136]  They sap our will through chemical induction into the water and food and air.
[00:17:03.136 --> 00:17:13.140]  You are under the most unbelievably mechanized, detailed, crafted, genius system of mass murder and control.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:18.142]  You are being crammed feet first into a globalist, soul-sucking meat grinder.
[00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.305]  And I'm going to ask you something.
[00:17:21.305 --> 00:17:22.826]  Do you really want to be part of this?
[00:17:22.826 --> 00:17:25.107]  Do you really want these people to be able to carry this out?
[00:17:25.107 --> 00:17:47.217]  Because the globalists openly write and say, hey, if you were human beings, if you didn't deserve this to happen to you under survival of the fittest, if you truly had a
[00:17:51.514 --> 00:17:56.419]  right to even debate us, you would wake up and see what we're doing to you.
[00:17:56.419 --> 00:17:58.702]  I mean, that's their message.
[00:17:58.702 --> 00:18:02.966]  Their message is, you've been told what we're doing to you, you've been warned.
[00:18:02.966 --> 00:18:08.392]  That's the main reason they let people like me on air.
[00:18:08.392 --> 00:18:11.956]  They just, they think so little of you, they think there's no hope for you.
[00:18:15.717 --> 00:18:20.280]  I mean, they're so far along in their plan now, they come out and just admit the whole thing publicly.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:31.866]  Hundreds and hundreds of news articles I've seen in the last month saying more than one child is bad and we need to tax children and we need to take people's children and raise them in dormitories and cameras need to be in the homes of all parents.
[00:18:31.866 --> 00:18:36.069]  20 plus thousand parents in the UK now have it.
[00:18:36.069 --> 00:18:39.731]  I mean, they mean business, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:39.731 --> 00:18:42.953]  These people mean business.
[00:18:42.953 --> 00:18:44.934]  They mean business big time.
[00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.051]  They're not playing games.
[00:18:51.051 --> 00:18:53.552]  And I understand a lot of people don't want to believe this show.
[00:18:53.552 --> 00:18:54.832]  They don't want to look into it.
[00:18:54.832 --> 00:18:59.993]  But I mean, you heard me 10, 12, 13, 14 years ago lay out everything that was going to happen.
[00:18:59.993 --> 00:19:01.194]  And now it's all come true.
[00:19:01.194 --> 00:19:07.195]  I mean, a lot of you lazy people wouldn't actually go look up the documents.
[00:19:07.195 --> 00:19:11.296]  You would just say I was lying.
[00:19:11.296 --> 00:19:14.577]  In fact, I saw a comment
[00:19:15.569 --> 00:19:19.330]  on a YouTube video posted of my interview with Governor Jesse Ventura yesterday.
[00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:31.532]  That was actually a post in an interview I did with John Ronson, who wrote the book, Men Who Stare at Ghosts, now a major motion picture.
[00:19:31.532 --> 00:19:35.933]  Ewan McGregor is the character that plays him in it.
[00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:42.894]  And I, uh, I pointed out to him that Ban Ki-moon wrote an editorial for the New York Times
[00:19:44.414 --> 00:19:50.379]  Called, titled, we can do it.
[00:19:50.379 --> 00:19:57.185]  And somebody's going around on all the YouTube videos saying I'm lying that he never wrote that article when he publicly did.
[00:19:57.185 --> 00:19:59.527]  That's the type of disinfo that's out there.
[00:20:01.243 --> 00:20:02.444]  The once mighty U.S.
[00:20:02.444 --> 00:20:05.465]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[00:20:05.465 --> 00:20:08.146]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[00:20:08.146 --> 00:20:11.327]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[00:20:11.327 --> 00:20:15.609]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[00:20:15.609 --> 00:20:19.711]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders.
[00:20:20.091 --> 00:20:23.714]  And Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[00:20:23.714 --> 00:20:24.955]  Prepare now!
[00:20:24.955 --> 00:20:29.898]  Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[00:20:29.898 --> 00:20:34.982]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish, with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:20:35.382 --> 00:20:40.184]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you're buying Factory Direct at wholesale prices.
[00:20:40.184 --> 00:20:42.385]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[00:21:01.144 --> 00:21:03.325]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:04.186]  Spy on me?
[00:21:04.186 --> 00:21:04.506]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.506 --> 00:21:09.549]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:11.189]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:11.189 --> 00:21:11.930]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.431]  Yeah, Startpage.com.
[00:21:13.431 --> 00:21:16.412]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:16.412 --> 00:21:20.274]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:20.274 --> 00:21:23.076]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:23.416 --> 00:21:26.017]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:26.017 --> 00:21:27.618]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.618 --> 00:21:27.918]  Right!
[00:21:27.918 --> 00:21:31.220]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:31.800]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.161]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:37.002]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:37.002 --> 00:21:40.804]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:22:01.758 --> 00:22:02.799]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:08.322]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:08.322 --> 00:22:08.863]  I get it.
[00:22:08.863 --> 00:22:18.489]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:18.489 --> 00:22:19.890]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:28.376]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:28.376 --> 00:22:31.618]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:31.758 --> 00:22:36.019]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:36.019 --> 00:22:37.619]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:37.619 --> 00:22:41.580]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.401]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:46.301]  You should, too.
[00:22:46.301 --> 00:22:47.461]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:47.461 --> 00:22:50.762]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:22:50.762 --> 00:22:50.822]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.822 --> 00:22:51.162]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:51.342]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.257 --> 00:23:08.240]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.500]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.320]  It's very real.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.561]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:23:12.561 --> 00:23:14.222]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:23:14.222 --> 00:23:18.684]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:23:49.463 --> 00:23:51.544]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:23:51.544 --> 00:23:51.925]  Bill Moyers
[00:24:15.208 --> 00:24:37.123]  who's really a prototype of David Gergen or Karl Rove is a really slick player and his propaganda is tailored to intellectual wealthy liberals and everything about Bill Moyers is a basically to build up credibility
[00:24:38.872 --> 00:24:46.578]  On issues like warrantless wiretapping, the police state, the shadow government, but then sell you socialism.
[00:24:46.578 --> 00:24:56.486]  Now, George Soros, one of the richest men in the world, indictments and criminal convictions against him all over the planet, who is helping drive down the dollar.
[00:24:56.486 --> 00:24:58.527]  He says he wants the dollar to fall.
[00:24:58.527 --> 00:25:03.772]  He is one of the main backers of President Barack Obama.
[00:25:04.744 --> 00:25:10.308]  He runs six major news websites that attack Alex Jones, yours truly, every week.
[00:25:10.308 --> 00:25:13.029]  He's a very dangerous person.
[00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:20.314]  Listen to how Bill Moyers on PBS, and we've got him on Laird NewsHour, we've got him on C-SPAN.
[00:25:20.314 --> 00:25:22.556]  I mean, he's making the rounds.
[00:25:22.556 --> 00:25:27.259]  Notice how they phrase this clip that we're going to play going into break and coming out of break from Bill Moyers.
[00:25:28.925 --> 00:25:36.227]  Last week, notice how Moyers phrases it that Soros has the moral high ground.
[00:25:36.227 --> 00:25:37.688]  What's wrong with America?
[00:25:37.688 --> 00:25:39.488]  We've lost our social compact.
[00:25:39.488 --> 00:25:42.469]  We've, you know, we've lost our morals.
[00:25:42.469 --> 00:25:46.250]  We don't have a sense of what we need to do, our duty.
[00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:54.832]  This is, of course, the setup for Soros to call for a new world order, global government, carbon tax, but they always leave real simple.
[00:25:54.832 --> 00:25:56.773]  It's like, we've got to save our earth.
[00:25:58.729 --> 00:26:02.790]  We've got to control our environment.
[00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.811]  Does it matter if plants breathe carbon dioxide?
[00:26:04.811 --> 00:26:06.892]  Does it matter if the Earth's been cooling for four years?
[00:26:06.892 --> 00:26:11.253]  Does it matter if 95% of the climatologists are more?
[00:26:11.253 --> 00:26:12.934]  The UN's got a few hundred.
[00:26:12.934 --> 00:26:17.376]  Over 30,000 have sent letters to Congress and filed lawsuits saying it's the sun.
[00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:19.856]  No kidding, the sun.
[00:26:19.856 --> 00:26:22.637]  Who would have thunk it?
[00:26:22.637 --> 00:26:25.618]  And now Al Gore's setting up a religion?
[00:26:25.618 --> 00:26:26.679]  These people mean business.
[00:26:29.002 --> 00:26:34.225]  We're talking about jihadis or crusaders for communism.
[00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:35.946]  But it's not your mama's communism.
[00:26:35.946 --> 00:26:37.907]  It's not your grandpa's communism.
[00:26:37.907 --> 00:26:42.069]  It's real communism run by the central banks.
[00:26:42.069 --> 00:26:49.072]  I remember the last Chinese president, before the current one, when he left office six, seven years ago, was in CNN.
[00:26:49.072 --> 00:26:55.215]  Communist Chinese leader says, China, the ultimate example of capitalism.
[00:26:55.215 --> 00:26:56.236]  People said, what does that mean?
[00:26:56.236 --> 00:26:57.817]  That's an oxymoron.
[00:26:57.817 --> 00:26:58.077]  No.
[00:26:59.648 --> 00:27:06.911]  Real capitalism is big, powerful robber barons coming in and financing communists, fascists, socialists, all command and control.
[00:27:06.911 --> 00:27:11.474]  Different flavors of the same thing.
[00:27:11.474 --> 00:27:19.137]  To bring in a command and control system to make you dependent on them so they can run your life.
[00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:24.440]  We're just gonna come back from break and play this clip and then get into all the other news.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.181]  But listen to George Soros here.
[00:27:29.946 --> 00:27:31.287]  Calling for a new world order.
[00:27:31.287 --> 00:27:32.548]  Calling for a global government.
[00:27:32.548 --> 00:27:35.791]  I mean, we can play the clips of Gordon Brown calling for global governance.
[00:27:35.791 --> 00:27:39.233]  We can play the clips of Al Gore calling for global governance.
[00:27:39.233 --> 00:27:43.156]  In fact, we have those clips in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:27:43.156 --> 00:27:47.860]  And Fall of the Republic is a flare.
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:48.821]  It is a warning.
[00:27:48.821 --> 00:27:49.842]  It is an SOS.
[00:27:52.503 --> 00:28:04.634]  Because after decades of denying world government and telling people they were kooks if they thought about it or talked about it, putting that psychological barrier in their minds, operant conditioning, it's like raising a hand to a dog.
[00:28:04.634 --> 00:28:11.340]  You can tell if somebody beats their dog or cat because they'll flinch away from your hand.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.121]  It's the same thing.
[00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:14.223]  They've beaten you so many times.
[00:28:14.223 --> 00:28:15.424]  There is no government corruption.
[00:28:15.424 --> 00:28:16.465]  There is no New World Order.
[00:28:16.465 --> 00:28:17.806]  The Federal Reserve is not private.
[00:28:18.991 --> 00:28:22.953]  And they beat you over the head with it, so now they come out and admit it all, and you just flinch.
[00:28:22.953 --> 00:28:27.854]  You hear, fellow Reserve, New World Order, I'm gonna pull my head into my turtle shell.
[00:28:27.854 --> 00:28:30.295]  I don't want my neighbors to think I'm a kook.
[00:28:30.295 --> 00:28:44.761]  So that when they launched world government, openly took over our sovereignty by unelected criminal private groups, as the pirates openly board our ship of state, and openly announce, run their flag up, and say, we've conquered you,
[00:28:45.717 --> 00:28:47.358]  You're going to pay your taxes to us now.
[00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:49.159]  We're going to micromanage your life.
[00:28:49.159 --> 00:28:55.903]  We're going to release youth brigades and national draft and environmental police on you.
[00:28:55.903 --> 00:29:03.768]  Everybody just stands down because everybody knows none of this exists.
[00:29:03.768 --> 00:29:06.510]  See, we're expecting Hitler to come marching down the street.
[00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.092]  He belonged to the 1930s and 40s.
[00:29:09.092 --> 00:29:12.614]  We expect Hitler to come marching down the street, who belonged to the 1920s to the 1950s.
[00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:18.956]  Or Mao Tse-Tung, who belonged to the 40s through the 70s.
[00:29:18.956 --> 00:29:19.997]  Uh-uh!
[00:29:19.997 --> 00:29:21.978]  This is our time to have tyrants.
[00:29:21.978 --> 00:29:23.980]  It's come to America!
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:29.643]  Just like everybody, a time to fight, a time to die, a time to live, a time to kill.
[00:29:29.643 --> 00:29:31.805]  Hey, folks, it's here!
[00:29:31.805 --> 00:29:34.107]  And it's the meanest, baddest thing we've ever seen.
[00:29:34.107 --> 00:29:35.147]  It's scientific.
[00:29:35.147 --> 00:29:35.948]  It's robotic.
[00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:40.756]  It's 21st century Buck Rogers tyranny.
[00:29:40.756 --> 00:29:43.699]  And if you can break their mind control, we can beat them.
[00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:46.902]  If you can't, they're gonna put you in a ditch and kill you.
[00:29:46.902 --> 00:29:48.103]  They mean to kill you.
[00:29:48.103 --> 00:29:51.406]  These are killers.
[00:29:51.406 --> 00:29:52.788]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.788 --> 00:29:55.330]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.013]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.026]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:06.026 --> 00:30:10.551]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:10.551 --> 00:30:12.834]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:12.834 --> 00:30:14.456]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:14.456 --> 00:30:15.497]  There is a solution.
[00:30:15.717 --> 00:30:24.139]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:07.645]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:31:07.645 --> 00:31:08.906]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:31:08.906 --> 00:31:09.726]  It's very real.
[00:31:09.726 --> 00:31:11.968]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:31:11.968 --> 00:31:13.629]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:32:01.684 --> 00:32:06.849]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[00:32:06.849 --> 00:32:10.353]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[00:32:10.353 --> 00:32:16.079]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:18.641]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:22.686]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:26.347]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.

[00:32:32.069 --> 00:32:34.330]  That's NoGerms.info.
[00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:42.893]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[00:32:42.893 --> 00:32:43.893]  Don't pick your nose.
[00:32:44.253 --> 00:32:48.835]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[00:32:48.835 --> 00:32:53.957]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[00:32:53.957 --> 00:32:55.697]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[00:32:55.697 --> 00:32:57.918]  That's NoGerms.info.
[00:32:57.918 --> 00:32:59.639]  Be well and stay well.
[00:32:59.639 --> 00:33:03.600]  Best MZ.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.701]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[00:33:06.701 --> 00:33:09.882]  In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[00:33:15.465 --> 00:33:35.882]  Has the whole global system become so complex with such gargantuan forces interlocked with each other driving it forward that it doesn't know how to obey Adam Smith's natural laws?
[00:33:35.882 --> 00:33:38.904]  No, I think our ability to govern ourselves
[00:33:39.725 --> 00:33:49.327]  It doesn't keep pace with our ability to exercise power over nature, control over nature.
[00:33:49.327 --> 00:34:02.991]  So, we are a very complicated civilization and we could actually destroy our civilization because of our inability to govern ourselves.
[00:34:02.991 --> 00:34:08.372]  Would this all be happening if we still had a strong sense of the social compact?
[00:34:09.152 --> 00:34:11.713]  Our social safety net has been greatly reduced.
[00:34:11.713 --> 00:34:16.656]  People have a real sense that the gods of capital have left little space for anyone else.
[00:34:16.656 --> 00:34:19.717]  People at the top don't have much empathy for people at the bottom.
[00:34:19.717 --> 00:34:23.719]  Yes, because there is a common interest.
[00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:27.961]  And this belief that everybody pursuing his self-interest
[00:34:28.621 --> 00:34:28.801]  No, no.
[00:34:59.322 --> 00:35:07.590]  Yes, you must have, in my opinion, you need, for instance, a tax on carbon emissions.
[00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:10.453]  But that is unacceptable politically.
[00:35:10.453 --> 00:35:12.835]  So we are going to have cap and trade.
[00:35:13.775 --> 00:35:32.333]  And the trading will have all kinds of loopholes and misuse of the regulations and all kinds of ways of making money without actually dealing with the problem that it's designed to cure.
[00:35:32.333 --> 00:35:36.017]  So that's how the political process distorts things.
[00:35:36.437 --> 00:35:40.781]  So, let's think about those people down at Neely's Barbecue going home tonight, having heard you.
[00:35:40.781 --> 00:35:44.324]  What they've heard you say is the system is really dysfunctioning right now.
[00:35:44.324 --> 00:35:45.205]  It's out of control.
[00:35:45.205 --> 00:35:46.786]  Nobody's in charge.
[00:35:46.786 --> 00:35:53.432]  They've heard you express your own worry that in the next three months it could get much, much worse.
[00:35:53.992 --> 00:36:00.578]  And they've heard you say that you don't see much good news immediately on the horizon.
[00:36:00.578 --> 00:36:03.260]  So let's leave them something to think about as they go home.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:07.764]  Let them go home and say, Mr. Soros said here are three things we can do simply.
[00:36:09.005 --> 00:36:24.999]  Well, deal with the mortgage problem, reduce foreclosures, recapitalize the banks, and then work on a better world order.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:32.766]  Where we work together to resolve problems that confront humanity, like global warming.
[00:36:32.766 --> 00:36:40.272]  And I think that dealing with global warming will require a lot of investment.
[00:36:40.272 --> 00:36:48.659]  You see, for the last 25 years, the world economy, the motor of the world economy that has been driving it,
[00:36:49.359 --> 00:36:55.862]  Was consumption by the American consumer who has been spending more than he's been saving.
[00:36:55.862 --> 00:36:57.962]  Alright?
[00:36:57.962 --> 00:36:59.703]  Than he's been producing.
[00:36:59.703 --> 00:37:03.725]  So, that motor is now switched off.
[00:37:03.725 --> 00:37:04.705]  It's finished.
[00:37:04.705 --> 00:37:08.987]  It's run out of... Can't continue.
[00:37:08.987 --> 00:37:10.747]  You need a new motor.
[00:37:10.747 --> 00:37:11.948]  And we have a big problem.
[00:37:12.731 --> 00:37:22.463]  Global warming requires big investment and that could be the motor of the world economy in the years to come.
[00:37:22.463 --> 00:37:26.128]  Putting more money in, building infrastructure, converting to green technology?
[00:37:29.291 --> 00:37:45.942]  Building an electricity grid, saving on energy, rewiring the houses, adjusting your lifestyle, where energy has got to cost more until you introduce those new things.
[00:37:45.942 --> 00:37:49.064]  So, it will be painful.
[00:37:49.064 --> 00:37:54.427]  Now, listening to that, that is high-grade mind control that you just heard.
[00:37:54.427 --> 00:37:57.049]  All lies, deceit, twisting.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:07.627]  A. George Soros went before Congress last year calling for the banker bailout, which was really the banking takeover.
[00:38:07.627 --> 00:38:09.468]  $23.7 trillion stolen in the U.S.
[00:38:09.468 --> 00:38:11.550]  given to private banks that he's connected to.
[00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:15.533]  $50 trillion plus worldwide altogether.
[00:38:15.533 --> 00:38:21.458]  Then he came out this year and testified against the banks as if he was the good guy fighting it all.
[00:38:22.887 --> 00:38:36.213]  Now he comes out and criticizes certain systems of cap-and-trade and admits that they're corrupt because he knows that their sales job is failing and says, what we need is investment.
[00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:38.434]  You're going to have to pay more for energy.
[00:38:38.434 --> 00:38:40.735]  That will fix the economy.
[00:38:40.735 --> 00:38:45.998]  And when he says investment, that's what Ban Ki-moon has been calling for in speech after speech from the UN.
[00:38:45.998 --> 00:38:49.900]  The Secretary General is direct global taxes on energy.
[00:38:50.948 --> 00:38:56.831]  Directly to the United Nations and global governance.
[00:38:56.831 --> 00:38:59.072]  And so what he's doing here is giving you a false choice.
[00:38:59.072 --> 00:39:08.336]  He's saying, oh no, you can choose cap-and-trade or you can choose direct global government and global taxes, which he calls investment.
[00:39:08.336 --> 00:39:13.759]  So he knows over 70% of Americans are against cap-and-trade and polls, so he comes out and says, oh I'm against cap-and-trade,
[00:39:16.772 --> 00:39:39.921]  What I'm for is investment, and then the investment is you're going to pay more for energy, and then he states the big lie that America is done, that the engine is dead, that Americans are bad, that we're in debt, that we consume more than we produce, when that's globalism that George Soros and others have challenged with tax incentives to move our industry overseas.
[00:39:41.482 --> 00:39:42.322]  We're good to go.
[00:40:03.263 --> 00:40:07.144]  They will decide what you can develop, what you can build, what you can do.
[00:40:07.144 --> 00:40:18.809]  And from that point, the bankers who've created these tens of trillions in fiat currency can force the sale of your companies, your farms, your ranches, your businesses to them.
[00:40:18.809 --> 00:40:28.573]  That's why they started in the last 20 years with things that sounded reasonable to set the precedent that a global regulatory authority can make the rules.
[00:40:28.573 --> 00:40:31.754]  They come out 20 years ago and say, the earth is dying,
[00:40:34.585 --> 00:40:38.588]  Chemicals in spray bottles.
[00:40:38.588 --> 00:40:42.772]  CFCs are destroying the ozone layer.
[00:40:42.772 --> 00:40:47.076]  Of course, it's now been documented in major scientific research.
[00:40:47.076 --> 00:40:55.503]  It's been published over and over again that during different parts of the year, the ozone layer naturally gets thin in different parts of the world.
[00:40:55.503 --> 00:41:00.087]  Just like the Arctic and the Antarctic gets bigger.
[00:41:01.542 --> 00:41:03.383]  In the winter and smaller in the summer.
[00:41:03.383 --> 00:41:13.931]  But they point a camera from space and show you a time-lapse photo in the summer of the Arctic at the north and the Antarctic at the south.
[00:41:13.931 --> 00:41:15.472]  Getting smaller.
[00:41:15.472 --> 00:41:18.154]  And they don't tell you, oh, it's just getting smaller than the summer.
[00:41:18.154 --> 00:41:20.176]  They say, oh, look, it just shrunk.
[00:41:20.176 --> 00:41:21.697]  It's all melting.
[00:41:21.697 --> 00:41:23.198]  See, it's all parlor tricks.
[00:41:24.588 --> 00:41:33.192]  And so they set the precedent because DuPont and Dow Chemical and others, their patents were up on the different chemicals in spray cans and in air conditioners.
[00:41:33.192 --> 00:41:34.373]  They had new patents out.
[00:41:36.647 --> 00:41:51.717]  Really, it was 25 years ago, and they forced everyone to buy their patents, shut down all the other refrigeration manufacturers, air conditioning manufacturers, made them all come buy the new patent, and that massively increased the cost, and they made huge profits.
[00:41:51.717 --> 00:41:55.639]  Imagine making everyone in the world who has air conditioning buy your new patent.
[00:41:55.639 --> 00:41:56.660]  That's why they passed that law.
[00:41:58.885 --> 00:42:09.653]  When they pass a global law through the UN, enforced by the Western powers and even mercenary forces to ban diamonds that aren't De Beers certified.
[00:42:09.653 --> 00:42:11.715]  They tell you it's to stop slavery.
[00:42:11.715 --> 00:42:13.096]  They tell you it's to stop abuse.
[00:42:13.096 --> 00:42:16.639]  They tell you their diamonds are clean and humane, which is actually a lie.
[00:42:17.406 --> 00:42:20.490]  They don't want African nations being able to produce their own diamonds.
[00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:23.314]  So they tell you terrorists are mining diamonds.
[00:42:23.314 --> 00:42:28.061]  Anyone that doesn't buy a diamond from them or from one of their mines is a terrorist.
[00:42:28.061 --> 00:42:31.506]  To keep the monopoly on diamonds that are only semi-precious.
[00:42:31.506 --> 00:42:32.788]  It's artificial scarcity.
[00:42:32.788 --> 00:42:33.328]  Same scam.
[00:42:33.789 --> 00:42:39.914]  Global government is about the central banks being the only people that can issue currency and credit so they can have control.
[00:42:39.914 --> 00:42:43.377]  It's about big central banks having the monopoly over diamonds.
[00:42:43.377 --> 00:42:47.080]  It's about big central banks having monopoly on where oil can be produced.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.921]  Alaska has more than Saudi Arabia.
[00:42:48.921 --> 00:42:49.762]  We can't have it.
[00:42:49.762 --> 00:42:53.565]  Another example.
[00:42:53.565 --> 00:42:56.367]  But now they're just skipping ahead of all of that and saying, you know what?
[00:42:56.367 --> 00:43:00.090]  We're going to pass a Copenhagen Treaty and we're going to have the nation states pass laws.
[00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.972]  Most of Europe and England have already done it.
[00:43:02.972 --> 00:43:03.373]  The U.S.
[00:43:03.373 --> 00:43:04.474]  is on the verge.
[00:43:04.474 --> 00:43:08.419]  Where an unelected group at the U.N.
[00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:19.171]  with the IMF can set rules on everything that has carbon involved in the manufacture or anything that puts off any type of gas, any type of greenhouse gas, or any type of carbon.
[00:43:20.618 --> 00:43:26.159]  And you're going to pay taxes to them on all of it, if they even let you have a business or a company.
[00:43:26.159 --> 00:43:30.040]  Now, listening to George Soros, you would think he was against all of that.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:37.141]  That's the twisted level of manipulation.
[00:43:37.141 --> 00:43:39.642]  I mean, I could do four hours just on that clip.
[00:43:39.642 --> 00:43:41.502]  We didn't even play the whole clip.
[00:43:41.502 --> 00:43:45.263]  Starting it and stopping it and analyzing everything he said.
[00:43:46.823 --> 00:43:48.284]  That's why he's George Soros.
[00:43:48.284 --> 00:43:49.865]  That's why Al Gore is Al Gore.
[00:43:49.865 --> 00:43:58.432]  These are slick, slick, slick, slick liars.
[00:43:58.432 --> 00:44:02.195]  Everything is about a monopoly for these individuals.
[00:44:02.195 --> 00:44:04.316]  Everything is about them being able to set the precedent.
[00:44:04.316 --> 00:44:09.360]  So first, oh, you can't have these different chemicals in spray bottles.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.201]  Eh, that sounds reasonable.
[00:44:10.201 --> 00:44:12.743]  We've got to save the earth.
[00:44:12.743 --> 00:44:14.244]  You can't have freon in air conditioning.
[00:44:14.244 --> 00:44:15.125]  Okay.
[00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:16.526]  Got to buy the new product from them.
[00:44:17.844 --> 00:44:20.705]  From a select group.
[00:44:20.705 --> 00:44:22.606]  Okay, we've got new light bulbs.
[00:44:22.606 --> 00:44:27.069]  They use less energy and it doesn't matter if they're toxic and have mercury in them.
[00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:29.010]  Everybody's got to adopt the new light bulbs.
[00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:31.631]  Hey, everybody's got to adopt a low flush toilet.
[00:44:31.631 --> 00:44:33.052]  It saves a lot of water.
[00:44:33.052 --> 00:44:33.752]  Sounds reasonable.
[00:44:33.752 --> 00:44:34.672]  Let's do it.
[00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:35.733]  That's a UN treaty.
[00:44:39.491 --> 00:44:42.274]  See, we're going under global government.
[00:44:42.274 --> 00:44:46.678]  There's UN treaties signed in 2000 for a world ID card.
[00:44:46.678 --> 00:44:51.383]  I mean, I'm still trying to convince the American people that we have a national ID card.
[00:44:52.369 --> 00:44:54.550]  Bill Clinton signed the executive order in 1994.
[00:44:54.550 --> 00:45:01.692]  It's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design, that I made in 1997.
[00:45:01.692 --> 00:45:03.712]  We had a national ID card in 1994.
[00:45:03.712 --> 00:45:10.454]  It still had the name of your state on it, but it was a federal computer system, standardized.
[00:45:10.454 --> 00:45:15.856]  Whether you lived in Alabama, Texas, New York, California, Alaska, but guess what?
[00:45:15.856 --> 00:45:16.756]  They didn't stop there.
[00:45:16.756 --> 00:45:20.277]  In England, in Germany, in Australia, all over the world,
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:29.246]  In the mid-90s, standardization went into place, and then in 2000, a UN treaty was signed.
[00:45:29.246 --> 00:45:32.549]  In Australia, they had a summit to standardize it globally.
[00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:33.509]  It was already standardized.
[00:45:33.509 --> 00:45:35.511]  They just made it the law.
[00:45:35.511 --> 00:45:40.635]  So, we had a world government ID card in 2000.
[00:45:40.635 --> 00:45:45.058]  Then, after the staged events of 9-11, they announced, oh, we are going to have a real ID.
[00:45:45.058 --> 00:45:48.381]  The feds are going to standardize your driver's license with a face scan and a thumbprint.
[00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:53.949]  When every state in the union already had that by 2000.
[00:45:53.949 --> 00:45:57.030]  See, we're already under the world government.
[00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.250]  We're already in it.
[00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:02.212]  They're just announcing it to you.
[00:46:02.212 --> 00:46:09.214]  That's why you hear, oh, foreigners have to be face scanned and thumb scanned and body scanned when they come into the U.S.
[00:46:09.214 --> 00:46:16.296]  What they don't tell you is that's a treaty when you fly out now to Japan or England or Germany or France or Russia.
[00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:19.855]  And every other nation's now adopting it.
[00:46:19.855 --> 00:46:23.698]  They haven't all adopted it, but they're all now getting in line to adopt it.
[00:46:23.698 --> 00:46:28.080]  You are now face scanned, thumb printed, body scanned when you fly out.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.182]  See, in every country, they sell it to their people.
[00:46:30.182 --> 00:46:33.444]  Hey, we're only doing this for foreigners.
[00:46:33.444 --> 00:46:36.485]  People are like, yeah, let's get the foreigners, there's too many of them.
[00:46:36.485 --> 00:46:42.549]  Oh, the government actually waives all that for them and lets them in and lets them violate visas.
[00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:47.052]  They told Texans they were thumb printing us to stop illegal aliens, but then they gave them waivers from it all.
[00:46:47.876 --> 00:46:50.538]  See, it's global.
[00:46:50.538 --> 00:46:52.420]  It's global.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:59.085]  And they always present it to you with their psych warfare chiefs and pitch men, their advertising execs.
[00:46:59.085 --> 00:47:01.788]  They know how to sell this to you.
[00:47:01.788 --> 00:47:04.270]  They know how to sell it to all of us.
[00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:08.453]  You got to get wise to their scams now.
[00:47:08.453 --> 00:47:12.476]  Of course I knew they were going to announce a national ID card because we already had one in 94.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.681]  Of course I knew they were going to put in body scanners.
[00:47:18.681 --> 00:47:20.661]  I read the UN treaties.
[00:47:20.661 --> 00:47:23.342]  People keep asking, how did you know all this was going to happen?
[00:47:23.342 --> 00:47:33.385]  How did you know that all the police in 1998 would suddenly be issued black uniforms and basically Darth Vader body armor?
[00:47:33.385 --> 00:47:38.046]  Because all over the Western world there were federal grants to the states to pay for it.
[00:47:38.046 --> 00:47:39.427]  Standardization of uniforms.
[00:47:40.461 --> 00:47:42.183]  To intimidate the people.
[00:47:42.183 --> 00:47:44.926]  And then now the police admit it's for intimidation.
[00:47:44.926 --> 00:47:47.388]  Any government that wants to intimidate you is bad.
[00:47:47.388 --> 00:47:55.876]  Period!
[00:47:55.876 --> 00:47:57.058]  Now I want to go over the news.
[00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:08.567]  And then when we come back in the second hour, we're gonna open the phones up on any issue you wish to discuss, any news item you wish to go over.
[00:48:08.567 --> 00:48:11.848]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:48:11.848 --> 00:48:13.228]  I also wanna make an announcement.
[00:48:13.228 --> 00:48:14.389]  We are implementing this tomorrow.
[00:48:14.389 --> 00:48:16.029]  It'll be up by the end of the show today.
[00:48:30.796 --> 00:48:44.139]  We're going to have a listener comment line, a lot of other radio shows do this, I don't know why we haven't done it in the past, we're doing it now, where you will call a number, you will be able to leave a one minute rant, or one minute question.
[00:48:44.139 --> 00:48:47.480]  People that disagree are welcome to call.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:51.901]  And we're gonna be playing these throughout the radio broadcast from now on.
[00:48:51.901 --> 00:48:54.322]  We'll play at least four or five of them every day, sometimes more.
[00:48:54.322 --> 00:48:58.343]  You can call in with your question, your comment, a mix of both.
[00:48:59.298 --> 00:49:07.943]  You will call the number that we'll announce at the end of the show, and you'll hear my voice say, Thanks for calling the InfoWars.com listener comment line.
[00:49:07.943 --> 00:49:13.526]  You've got 60 seconds for your question or comment.
[00:49:13.526 --> 00:49:20.290]  Again, you'll call the number, and you'll hear my voice say, Thanks for calling the listener comment line.
[00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:23.052]  You've got 60 seconds for your question or comment.
[00:49:23.052 --> 00:49:27.675]  Your rant, if you disagree with me, whatever the case is, hit me and hit me hard.
[00:49:30.359 --> 00:49:31.239]  I multitask here.
[00:49:31.239 --> 00:49:33.640]  I'm actually recording the message now live here on air.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.100]  Let me try one more here.
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.481]  That's how busy I am.
[00:49:36.481 --> 00:49:39.862]  I got international TV here today, radio interviews.
[00:49:39.862 --> 00:49:41.162]  Total torture, basically.
[00:49:41.162 --> 00:49:43.403]  I'm completely burnt out, but I've got to keep fighting.
[00:49:43.403 --> 00:49:44.663]  So I don't even have time to do this.
[00:49:44.663 --> 00:49:48.724]  I've got to cut a radio ad for TED to run nationwide on radio for Fall of the Republic.
[00:49:48.724 --> 00:49:49.464]  So much going on.
[00:49:49.464 --> 00:49:51.005]  So I'll just multitask right now.
[00:49:53.598 --> 00:49:56.239]  You've reached the InfoWars comment line.
[00:49:56.239 --> 00:50:00.542]  You've got 60 seconds for your comment, your question, your rant, whatever it is.
[00:50:00.542 --> 00:50:04.064]  You got... Say it again.
[00:50:04.064 --> 00:50:07.306]  If I was live, I am live, but normally if I'm live, I can't mess up on something.
[00:50:07.306 --> 00:50:10.287]  Then when I try to record something, I do.
[00:50:10.287 --> 00:50:14.390]  Thanks for calling the InfoWars.com listener line.
[00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:16.511]  We'll air your question or comment on air.
[00:50:17.677 --> 00:50:19.938]  Oh yeah, I need to make the point that when they call this it's going to be aired.
[00:50:19.938 --> 00:50:21.399]  Let me make that point.
[00:50:21.399 --> 00:50:22.299]  Go ahead and hold the music, John.
[00:50:22.299 --> 00:50:23.179]  I'm going to get this right now.
[00:50:23.179 --> 00:50:26.221]  I'm going to say it right now.
[00:50:26.221 --> 00:50:29.862]  Thanks for calling the Infowars.com radio listener line.
[00:50:29.862 --> 00:50:32.844]  You've got 60 seconds for your question or comment.
[00:50:32.844 --> 00:50:33.604]  60 seconds.
[00:50:33.604 --> 00:50:37.626]  And if it's good, we'll put it on air.
[00:50:37.626 --> 00:50:39.347]  There, nailed that one finally.
[00:50:39.347 --> 00:50:41.027]  I guess four is the charm.
[00:50:41.027 --> 00:50:45.990]  Alright, we're going to come back after break, get into a bunch of news I haven't even hit on yet.
[00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.610]  They've marked up
[00:50:48.988 --> 00:50:52.372]  To go to the full Senate, the government take over healthcare.
[00:50:52.372 --> 00:50:53.393]  Look out!
[00:50:53.393 --> 00:50:55.636]  And a lot more gold went over $1,126 today.
[00:50:55.636 --> 00:50:56.277]  It's getting crazy.
[00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:06.171]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:02.182 --> 00:52:06.203]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.203 --> 00:52:09.444]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.444 --> 00:52:14.245]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:52:14.245 --> 00:52:20.627]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.627 --> 00:52:22.868]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:23.448 --> 00:52:25.830]  ...as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:29.092]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:52:29.092 --> 00:52:35.937]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.937 --> 00:52:38.278]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.278 --> 00:52:39.879]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.879 --> 00:52:42.341]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.341 --> 00:52:44.463]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.463 --> 00:52:49.126]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.586 --> 00:52:58.710]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.463]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:53:04.463 --> 00:53:14.609]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.

[00:53:50.122 --> 00:53:51.303]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:53:51.303 --> 00:53:51.723]  Eastern.
[00:53:51.723 --> 00:53:52.363]  We're here live.
[00:53:52.363 --> 00:53:54.885]  I come back Sundays live with an abbreviated transmission.
[00:54:19.438 --> 00:54:20.299]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:54:20.299 --> 00:54:21.340]  Central Standard Time.

[00:54:34.532 --> 00:54:39.036]  We're not funded by the New World Order, the Rockefeller Foundation, George Soros.
[00:54:39.036 --> 00:54:40.498]  We're on the White House enemies list.
[00:54:40.498 --> 00:54:41.438]  We're having a big effect.
[00:54:42.159 --> 00:54:45.902]  We appreciate all of your support as we shatter the left-right paradigm.
[00:54:45.902 --> 00:55:01.615]  We've got all the books and videos and some really great combo deals where you can get Aaron Russo's Reflections and Warnings, a great documentary I made, for free when you get it with Fall of the Republic at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:55:05.538 --> 00:55:07.518]  888-253-3139.
[00:55:07.518 --> 00:55:10.679]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at P.O.
[00:55:10.679 --> 00:55:17.040]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:21.221]  Your calls are coming up in the next hour, then I'm going to go through this news, but let me go ahead and mention it now.
[00:55:21.221 --> 00:55:25.101]  German Chancellor Merkel calls for a new world order.
[00:55:25.101 --> 00:55:26.702]  We have her disgusting quotes here.
[00:55:26.702 --> 00:55:35.283]  She calls it a planetary regime, but all the police training manuals say it doesn't exist, and you're a cop killer if you talk about it.
[00:55:36.664 --> 00:55:41.827]  Can the police put two and two together, who the real enemy is here?
[00:55:41.827 --> 00:55:50.691]  Also, I haven't gotten into it, but at the bottom of the next hour, I'm going to spend 10 minutes and give you my breakdown on what happened with the Fort Hood shooting.
[00:55:50.691 --> 00:55:54.993]  I haven't really talked about it because I'm wanting to process, gauge the information.
[00:55:54.993 --> 00:55:58.435]  You heard Ventura on the show yesterday thinking it's an inside job.
[00:55:58.435 --> 00:56:00.136]  Everybody I talk to, I respect.
[00:56:00.136 --> 00:56:02.897]  That's their same gut reaction with all the MO, all the evidence.
[00:56:02.897 --> 00:56:03.778]  We'll be talking about that.
[00:56:06.124 --> 00:56:12.869]  Whatever's going on, they're certainly capitalizing on it for the police state.
[00:56:12.869 --> 00:56:21.274]  And they kept calling it a cop killer gun he used, and I went and looked at a Wired Magazine weapons review by a weapons armorer, and they said it is not a cop killer.
[00:56:21.274 --> 00:56:23.156]  But any gun can be a cop killer.
[00:56:23.156 --> 00:56:25.337]  But see, that's how they're trying to demonize the Second Amendment.
[00:56:25.337 --> 00:56:28.079]  They're saying, well, it shoots a rifle round.
[00:56:28.079 --> 00:56:31.021]  There are hundreds of pistols that shoot a rifle round.
[00:56:31.021 --> 00:56:32.982]  And yeah, it's a rifle round, a cut down .223,
[00:56:35.982 --> 00:56:38.064]  Extremely weak.
[00:56:38.064 --> 00:56:47.231]  And Wired Magazine tested it and found that it only pierces cruddy shrapnel vest.
[00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:50.554]  You know, stuff they had 30, 40 years ago.
[00:56:50.554 --> 00:56:53.256]  The lightest body armor up close, it'll pierce it.
[00:56:53.256 --> 00:56:54.357]  Well, that's the whole point.
[00:56:54.357 --> 00:56:55.758]  Any rifle round will.
[00:56:55.758 --> 00:56:58.140]  So there's now calls to ban this round.
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.803]  If they do that, it'll set the precedent to ban all rifle rounds.
[00:57:01.513 --> 00:57:10.537]  There aren't many types of body armor that'll stop a .308 or a 7mm mag.
[00:57:10.537 --> 00:57:18.240]  The toughest breastplate might deflect it, but you're gonna feel like you got kicked by an elephant.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:22.622]  So, again, that's the mind control, the oxymoron of a gun being a cop killer.
[00:57:22.622 --> 00:57:23.643]  Any gun's a cop killer.
[00:57:23.643 --> 00:57:25.123]  A meat cleaver's a cop killer.
[00:57:25.123 --> 00:57:26.364]  A butcher knife's a cop killer.
[00:57:28.919 --> 00:57:34.441]  But see, once they sell the idea of banning anything that's a cop killer, they can ban it all.
[00:57:34.441 --> 00:57:37.322]  Just thought you might want to know that.
[00:57:37.322 --> 00:57:38.603]  That's how the scam works.
[00:57:38.603 --> 00:57:40.064]  This is from the Hill newspaper.
[00:57:40.064 --> 00:57:43.365]  Reid puts House health care bill on Senate calendar.
[00:57:43.365 --> 00:57:47.046]  It's going to a vote.
[00:57:47.046 --> 00:57:50.748]  And all the neocon blogs are lying, saying, oh, don't worry, it won't pass.
[00:57:50.748 --> 00:57:52.609]  Just like they said it wouldn't pass the House.
[00:57:52.609 --> 00:57:55.010]  Just like they said cap and trade wouldn't pass the House.
[00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:57.811]  I'm going to tell you right now, as things stand, it's going to pass.
[00:57:57.811 --> 00:57:57.991]  Okay?
[00:57:59.505 --> 00:58:05.549]  It's gonna pass, unless you don't buy the hoax.
[00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:07.371]  How many times do I have to be proven right about this?
[00:58:07.371 --> 00:58:19.419]  They have a playbook, they have a handbook, and they have all the big Fox News, News Corp-owned publications saying, don't worry, it's not gonna pass.
[00:58:19.419 --> 00:58:23.042]  You might wanna check into the fact, in fact, we're gonna play that clip today.
[00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:32.138]  that News Corp put out, Rupert Murdoch put out a five minute video where he brags that he wants a global tax and quote, stop global warming.
[00:58:32.138 --> 00:58:35.821]  So, they're behind it, okay?
[00:58:35.821 --> 00:58:38.404]  They're Judas Iscariot, period.
[00:58:38.404 --> 00:58:43.348]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:43.348 --> 00:58:45.851]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.851 --> 00:58:48.173]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.816 --> 00:58:55.359]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:55.359 --> 00:58:56.260]  Number one.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:59.702]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.702 --> 00:59:00.563]  Number two.
[00:59:00.563 --> 00:59:05.446]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.446 --> 00:59:06.186]  It's true.
[00:59:06.186 --> 00:59:11.070]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:11.890]  Number three.
[00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:15.472]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.472 --> 00:59:19.175]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.375 --> 00:59:20.176]  Number 4.
[00:59:20.176 --> 00:59:22.938]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.938 --> 00:59:26.621]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.621 --> 00:59:27.402]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.402 --> 00:59:31.546]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.546 --> 00:59:36.310]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:40.773]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.773 --> 00:59:42.554]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.554 --> 00:59:44.815]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.815 --> 00:59:47.417]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:56.222]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.222 --> 01:00:05.628]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.628 --> 01:00:06.208]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.923 --> 01:00:08.685]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.685 --> 01:00:10.447]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.447 --> 01:00:12.028]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.028 --> 01:00:13.570]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:17.774]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.774 --> 01:00:21.818]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.628 --> 01:00:26.469]  We are now into our number two, your phone calls.
[01:00:26.469 --> 01:00:45.893]  Coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, fresh off a big debate yesterday at the University of Texas against the pro-vaccine crowd, will be in studio for an hour and a half at the end of the transmission today, 1.30 central time in studio.
[01:00:45.893 --> 01:00:48.414]  Reid puts House health care bill on Senate calendar.
[01:00:48.414 --> 01:00:49.814]  They're going to try to pass this sucker.
[01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:55.071]  November 16th is Judgment Day.
[01:00:55.071 --> 01:00:57.512]  High noon.
[01:00:57.512 --> 01:01:03.414]  Blacktop.
[01:01:03.414 --> 01:01:06.075]  That's when the rubber meets the road.
[01:01:06.075 --> 01:01:08.056]  Dow and gold hit the heights.
[01:01:08.056 --> 01:01:09.596]  Why is the Dow and gold up?
[01:01:09.596 --> 01:01:10.617]  The Dow's not up.
[01:01:10.617 --> 01:01:11.657]  Gold's not up.
[01:01:11.657 --> 01:01:12.818]  The dollar's down.
[01:01:12.818 --> 01:01:16.359]  It takes more dollars to buy Dow stocks.
[01:01:16.359 --> 01:01:19.080]  It takes more dollars to buy gold.
[01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:23.931]  The dollar is being dumped worldwide incrementally.
[01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:26.232]  The long slide into the abyss.
[01:01:26.232 --> 01:01:30.373]  The globalist trap, as George Soros said last hour.
[01:01:30.373 --> 01:01:34.034]  Bragging on Bill Moyers that America is done.
[01:01:34.034 --> 01:01:42.536]  It's done if he has his way so this vulture, this anti-human, can have his way.
[01:01:42.536 --> 01:01:44.737]  It's creepy having his entire empire attacking me.
[01:01:47.881 --> 01:01:50.261]  George Demon Soros.
[01:01:50.261 --> 01:01:55.763]  S&P 500 climbs to 13-month high as commodities rally.
[01:01:55.763 --> 01:01:58.003]  Gold.
[01:01:58.003 --> 01:02:00.363]  Gold surged.
[01:02:00.363 --> 01:02:02.864]  Absolutely surged.
[01:02:02.864 --> 01:02:04.164]  This is the last number I got.
[01:02:04.164 --> 01:02:11.546]  I need to refresh it on the mercantile exchange.
[01:02:11.546 --> 01:02:12.726]  But it's absolutely
[01:02:14.122 --> 01:02:16.764]  Exploding right now and it's all over the map.
[01:02:16.764 --> 01:02:21.788]  So we'll get you the latest numbers on gold.
[01:02:21.788 --> 01:02:22.969]  In fact, I want to find out right now.
[01:02:22.969 --> 01:02:29.634]  I'm going to find out what gold is right now here on air.
[01:02:29.634 --> 01:02:33.157]  Put the word gold in the old Googler.
[01:02:33.157 --> 01:02:43.665]  Go down here and click on the mercantile exchange and give you
[01:02:48.226 --> 01:02:49.787]  The number, it's 113.40.
[01:02:49.787 --> 01:03:01.435]  Trying to find the article I've got where it said in futures it was 1,126.
[01:03:01.435 --> 01:03:05.058]  I must have been looking at some gold stock or something, I can't keep track of anymore.
[01:03:05.058 --> 01:03:07.299]  But it is very, very high right now, up $7.60 today.
[01:03:07.299 --> 01:03:08.620]  So we'll be going over
[01:03:16.601 --> 01:03:17.221]  That as well.
[01:03:17.221 --> 01:03:20.864]  77 students give an incorrect flu shot.
[01:03:20.864 --> 01:03:22.004]  Hey, shoot them up with something.
[01:03:22.004 --> 01:03:23.545]  The schools get bonuses.
[01:03:23.545 --> 01:03:31.210]  77 students were mistakenly given the seasonal flu vaccine when parents had signed consent forms for their children to be given H1N1 vaccine.
[01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:31.710]  Hey, it doesn't matter.
[01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:33.211]  The regular flu shot's got it in there, too.
[01:03:33.211 --> 01:03:37.654]  For whatever reason, they want that in your body.
[01:03:37.654 --> 01:03:41.817]  Chicago Mayor Daley blames Fort Hood massacre on America's love of guns.
[01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:44.619]  That is a disgusting quote by the son of the most famous U.S.
[01:03:44.619 --> 01:03:45.099]  crime boss.
[01:03:47.659 --> 01:03:48.522]  Here's another headline.
[01:03:48.522 --> 01:03:51.229]  State to spy on every cell phone call, email, and web search.
[01:03:51.229 --> 01:03:52.573]  The government's just announcing this.
[01:03:52.573 --> 01:03:53.576]  Oh, we're spying on everything.
[01:03:53.576 --> 01:03:53.997]  It's freedom.
[01:04:00.566 --> 01:04:04.828]  As the Berlin Wall date passed a few days ago, Merkel challenges U.S.
[01:04:04.828 --> 01:04:06.108]  power and calls for a new world order.
[01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:09.429]  I thought I'd add, she didn't just call for a new world order, she called for the end of U.S.
[01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:09.750]  power.
[01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:17.613]  See, the globalists are done using us to fund and basically be the muscle for this private world government.
[01:04:17.613 --> 01:04:22.615]  And so they're now going to ram the world government through under the slogan of America-hating.
[01:04:22.615 --> 01:04:25.956]  See, they pile all the sins on the U.S.
[01:04:25.956 --> 01:04:27.697]  You've heard me talk about this for decades, haven't you?
[01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:28.177]  It's now here.
[01:04:28.919 --> 01:04:41.371]  How they would then build the world government, fund the world government, back up the world government with our muscle, run up our debt, bankrupt us, then blame it all on us and say world government's the solution to end the American empire.
[01:04:41.371 --> 01:04:46.716]  And the third world and Europe and Asia will all go clamoring over the edge of the cliff into the hands of the bankers.
[01:04:48.894 --> 01:04:50.535]  Even more into the hands of the bankers.
[01:04:50.535 --> 01:04:52.456]  Even more into the sway of the bankers.
[01:04:52.456 --> 01:04:58.279]  This is how their little problem reaction solution game plan operates.
[01:04:58.279 --> 01:04:59.759]  Your phone call straight ahead.
[01:04:59.759 --> 01:05:01.020]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:08.744]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[01:05:08.744 --> 01:05:14.827]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:17.448]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:05:17.788 --> 01:05:24.055]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:05:24.055 --> 01:05:28.140]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:33.446]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:05:33.746 --> 01:05:35.828]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:05:35.828 --> 01:05:37.570]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:40.112]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:05:40.112 --> 01:05:44.837]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:05:44.837 --> 01:05:48.540]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:51.663]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:51.663 --> 01:05:53.565]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:53.565 --> 01:05:55.687]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:01.832 --> 01:06:05.853]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.853 --> 01:06:09.094]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:09.094 --> 01:06:13.895]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.895 --> 01:06:20.297]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.297 --> 01:06:22.518]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:23.058 --> 01:06:24.558]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:06:24.558 --> 01:06:25.839]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.839 --> 01:06:28.079]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.963 --> 01:06:49.246]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:49.246 --> 01:06:58.349]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:09.497]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:07:09.497 --> 01:07:12.859]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:07:12.859 --> 01:07:18.744]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:23.507]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:07:23.507 --> 01:07:25.869]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:35.334]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:07:35.334 --> 01:07:40.878]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[01:08:02.429 --> 01:08:07.972]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.702 --> 01:08:22.260]  Next hour, when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv for all the television viewers at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting the radio show, I'm going to play the video clips, audio for the listeners.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.241]  It all translates well.
[01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:37.794]  But even better in living color, a Fox News promotional video they put out, well Fox TV, bragging how they put their full energies behind pushing the global warming, global carbon tax takeover.
[01:08:37.794 --> 01:08:48.680]  I just want to show you why in the few neocon fake properties that Rupert Murdoch has just to betray conservatives and manipulate them,
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.921]  They will come out and claim that, oh, they're not going to pass cap-and-trade in the House.
[01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:53.361]  And they did.
[01:08:53.361 --> 01:08:55.362]  Oh, they're not going to pass the health care in the House.
[01:08:55.362 --> 01:08:55.982]  Stand down.
[01:08:55.982 --> 01:08:56.722]  Everything's fine.
[01:08:56.722 --> 01:08:57.543]  We've won.
[01:08:57.543 --> 01:08:58.043]  Go home.
[01:08:58.043 --> 01:08:59.623]  There's no battle.
[01:08:59.623 --> 01:09:05.685]  And now all the big neocon publications are saying, the New York Post, you name it, oh, it's beaten.
[01:09:05.685 --> 01:09:06.506]  Don't worry.
[01:09:06.506 --> 01:09:09.547]  Health care won't pass.
[01:09:09.547 --> 01:09:10.727]  It's never going to get to the floor.
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.141]  It's never going to get to the floor for a vote.
[01:09:14.141 --> 01:09:15.021]  It's not going to pass.
[01:09:15.021 --> 01:09:15.761]  Everything's fine.
[01:09:15.761 --> 01:09:16.501]  Everything's wonderful.
[01:09:16.501 --> 01:09:17.582]  Go back to sleep.
[01:09:17.582 --> 01:09:18.382]  Don't worry.
[01:09:18.382 --> 01:09:19.882]  They're not going to pass cap and trade.
[01:09:19.882 --> 01:09:20.282]  Oh, really?
[01:09:20.282 --> 01:09:23.383]  It's getting ready to go to the floor in the next three weeks.
[01:09:23.383 --> 01:09:26.584]  It's getting ready to go to the floor on health care and cap and trade.
[01:09:26.584 --> 01:09:29.845]  I mean, this is the military techniques they use against us.
[01:09:29.845 --> 01:09:31.586]  I mean, do you like being suckers?
[01:09:31.586 --> 01:09:33.526]  I don't.
[01:09:33.526 --> 01:09:34.887]  So I'm going to prove this next hour.
[01:09:35.896 --> 01:09:40.761]  Because I get emails going, Rupert Murdoch's not for global warming being man-made.
[01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:42.783]  You're a lying liberal.
[01:09:42.783 --> 01:09:45.386]  Yeah, I'm a liberal.
[01:09:45.386 --> 01:09:52.133]  As much as I'm a Chinese jet pilot from Pluto.
[01:09:52.133 --> 01:09:52.914]  I'm a liberal.
[01:09:55.444 --> 01:09:56.825]  Like George Washington.
[01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:57.745]  No, I'm not a liberal.
[01:09:57.745 --> 01:09:58.826]  I'm not a conservative.
[01:09:58.826 --> 01:09:59.967]  I'm a truth teller.
[01:09:59.967 --> 01:10:01.508]  I'm somebody who's not conned.
[01:10:01.508 --> 01:10:03.069]  I'm somebody who's not manipulated.
[01:10:03.069 --> 01:10:09.772]  I'm somebody who's studied these people day in, day out, hour after hour, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.
[01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:11.313]  I've learned their tricks.
[01:10:11.313 --> 01:10:13.575]  Anyone could learn their tricks just studying these people.
[01:10:14.255 --> 01:10:16.436]  You may not know anything about football.
[01:10:16.436 --> 01:10:18.977]  You may have watched five or six football games your whole life.
[01:10:18.977 --> 01:10:23.218]  You start watching football for three or four years, you're going to learn a lot about football.
[01:10:23.218 --> 01:10:26.279]  You get obsessed with football 14 hours a day.
[01:10:26.279 --> 01:10:30.500]  In 14 years, you're going to be an absolute football master.
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.581]  I'm nobody special!
[01:10:33.581 --> 01:10:35.502]  You can learn how they operate as well.
[01:10:37.779 --> 01:10:39.420]  I know a lot of you are smarter than I am.
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.762]  You can figure it out.
[01:10:40.762 --> 01:10:44.125]  And I need you to get up off your hind ends and get out there and educate others.
[01:10:44.125 --> 01:10:47.828]  We don't have a lot of time.
[01:10:47.828 --> 01:10:50.270]  And the time for denial is over.
[01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:51.351]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:10:51.351 --> 01:10:52.592]  Chris and Marilyn, you're on the air.
[01:10:52.592 --> 01:10:55.675]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:10:55.675 --> 01:10:59.999]  I'm doing alright, but my country's being taken over by a bunch of criminal bankers and I want to stop them.
[01:11:00.694 --> 01:11:02.896]  No kidding, no kidding, no kidding.
[01:11:02.896 --> 01:11:14.705]  Hey listen, I just want to let you know, I'm that fella that works at Walter Reed and that Fort Hood shooter used to come to my lunch line every day.
[01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:17.687]  What's your take on this creature?
[01:11:17.687 --> 01:11:22.271]  I think the government's full of crap.
[01:11:22.271 --> 01:11:22.651]  Point blank.
[01:11:24.247 --> 01:11:27.650]  No, matter of fact, he was a normal guy, just like you or I. Not really outspoken.
[01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:31.534]  I'll tell you what, I have a hard time believing what the government's saying based by the fact that
[01:11:45.956 --> 01:11:50.419]  Before he comes into the military, he has to go through a full FBI investigation.
[01:11:50.419 --> 01:11:55.002]  And if there was something amiss, and they were concerned about it, he wouldn't have gotten in.
[01:11:55.703 --> 01:11:57.904]  It's ten times worse than that.
[01:11:57.904 --> 01:12:05.406]  It turns out the FBI and CIA were reading all his email, knew about this for a year, but they won't release the details to Congress.
[01:12:05.406 --> 01:12:07.207]  Congress, who is the boss.
[01:12:07.207 --> 01:12:09.027]  Congress, who makes the laws.
[01:12:09.027 --> 01:12:10.968]  Congress, who is over the executive.
[01:12:10.968 --> 01:12:11.848]  Not co-equal.
[01:12:11.848 --> 01:12:15.849]  First they said, oh, the executive, judicial, and legislative are all co-equal.
[01:12:15.849 --> 01:12:17.350]  They said that in the last 50 years.
[01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:19.930]  Then, oh, the executive's over everything.
[01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:23.612]  The executive is telling the Congress what to do.
[01:12:23.612 --> 01:12:24.552]  The Pentagon
[01:12:26.781 --> 01:12:32.827]  Is telling the Congress we're not going to release this, just like they won't release the full text of PDD 51.
[01:12:32.827 --> 01:12:40.395]  But the cover sheet of that Presidential Decision Directive states that the President is a dictator.
[01:12:40.395 --> 01:12:42.317]  So again, this is all lawless.
[01:12:42.317 --> 01:12:44.599]  They should release it all, but they won't do it.
[01:12:44.599 --> 01:12:48.643]  Now, if he was really al-Qaeda, why did they let him do this?
[01:12:48.643 --> 01:12:50.365]  Why wasn't he thrown out of the military?
[01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:50.525]  Hmm?
[01:12:51.175 --> 01:12:52.977]  Well, here's something that's interesting.
[01:12:52.977 --> 01:12:58.802]  When I was in the military, they taught us, you know, terrorist tactics, or, you know, to watch out.
[01:12:58.802 --> 01:13:09.592]  And one thing is, they say terrorists like to hit soft targets, and Walter Reed would have been a soft target that would have gotten tons of attention.
[01:13:09.592 --> 01:13:14.577]  I'm just glad his light didn't go out when I was at work.
[01:13:17.486 --> 01:13:20.188]  Well, I would love to believe the official story.
[01:13:20.188 --> 01:13:25.572]  Believe me, it's a lot less scary to know there are lone nuts out there than to think the government somehow was involved in this or let it happen.
[01:13:25.572 --> 01:13:28.615]  But all the evidence points towards that.
[01:13:28.615 --> 01:13:31.077]  And coming up near the end of the hour, I'm going to break it down.
[01:13:31.077 --> 01:13:35.640]  Anything else you can tell us about this person, Chris?
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:44.887]  Yeah, one of his... Well, actually, he was an intern under a doctor who I know very well, and he doesn't know what to make of it.
[01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:45.488]  And I asked him,
[01:13:46.533 --> 01:13:48.374]  Does he really believe the official story?
[01:13:48.374 --> 01:13:51.095]  And he just, he shifted his head and he said, I don't know.
[01:13:51.095 --> 01:13:58.097]  He says, I find it hard to believe, but he just, he couldn't give a hundred percent for sure answer if he thought it was true or not.
[01:13:58.097 --> 01:14:02.478]  I have a hard time swallowing the pill that the government wants me to feed.
[01:14:02.478 --> 01:14:04.919]  I mean, heck, if they miss inoculate 77 kids, I mean, hey.
[01:14:08.993 --> 01:14:09.974]  Well, it's more than that.
[01:14:09.974 --> 01:14:16.719]  They've been caught nationwide from New York to Kentucky forcibly injecting elementary students because they can't speak up for themselves.
[01:14:16.719 --> 01:14:20.782]  They only do it to 3rd and 4th and 5th graders and 1st graders and 2nd graders.
[01:14:20.782 --> 01:14:26.666]  They keep accidentally injecting them and then accidentally having the same story nationwide.
[01:14:26.666 --> 01:14:28.167]  Oh, that it was an accident.
[01:14:28.167 --> 01:14:31.049]  Chris, I appreciate your call.
[01:14:31.049 --> 01:14:32.450]  Let's talk to Chris in Georgia.
[01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:35.452]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:14:35.452 --> 01:14:36.173]  Alex.
[01:14:36.173 --> 01:14:36.433]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:38.032 --> 01:14:48.078]  Uh, you know, first of all, right off, if you ever, uh, get rid of that recording of, uh, it's the longest day I'll never listen to your sh- The longest day I'll never listen to your show again.
[01:14:48.078 --> 01:14:49.359]  No, that's- I love that.
[01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:51.220]  It just inspires me every time.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.061]  If I ever get rid of what?
[01:14:54.061 --> 01:15:00.165]  The recording of the longest day that you have?
[01:15:00.165 --> 01:15:07.169]  The recording of the- I like that record- I like that recording, and I hope you don't lose it, but, um,
[01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:23.875]  Cynthia McKinney is my... You have a wonderful recording of The Longest Day that Paul Anker wrote.
[01:15:23.875 --> 01:15:27.196]  I know that one.
[01:15:27.196 --> 01:15:29.537]  That just inspires me every time.
[01:15:29.537 --> 01:15:31.397]  I was talking to Cynthia McKinney.
[01:15:31.397 --> 01:15:32.638]  She was my Congresslady.
[01:15:34.144 --> 01:15:35.865]  Would like to come back on your show.
[01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:37.487]  She wants to talk to you again.
[01:15:37.487 --> 01:15:38.727]  You know, here's the crazy thing.
[01:15:38.727 --> 01:15:43.251]  Every time I finally get her on, she says, I haven't heard from you.
[01:15:43.251 --> 01:15:45.032]  I would love to come on your show.
[01:15:45.032 --> 01:15:47.034]  And I can't get through her people.
[01:15:47.034 --> 01:15:50.997]  I mean, I cannot get her on for like two years.
[01:15:50.997 --> 01:15:56.141]  And then every time I talk to people that know her, she's like, no, I want to go on Alex's show.
[01:15:56.141 --> 01:16:00.744]  So for the life of me, I don't know how to get Cynthia McKinney on.
[01:16:00.744 --> 01:16:01.825]  I mean, do you have her contact info?
[01:16:03.203 --> 01:16:05.004]  Well, yeah, I've got her email.
[01:16:05.004 --> 01:16:06.906]  I'll email her again.
[01:16:06.906 --> 01:16:20.716]  But the real thing I called you about was, it seems to me, you're supposed to do a couple of shows, a couple of episodes on, like, the mechanics of neighborhood organization, what people are doing in their neighborhoods, and they're at their city hall, the kinds of
[01:16:21.434 --> 01:16:27.457]  How they're working with neighbors, how do you deal with their psychology of trying to wake people up?
[01:16:27.457 --> 01:16:39.282]  Yeah, well what the government does is they know the true powers at the local level, so the feds come in with programs to create fake neighborhood and city and community organizations which push the globalist agenda.
[01:16:39.282 --> 01:16:45.585]  We have to go in and show people how they're being manipulated and show them how they're made to be
[01:16:46.844 --> 01:16:51.368]  How they're made to feel important by the system and how they're being brainwashed.
[01:16:51.368 --> 01:17:03.379]  But pick an issue like land grabbing or city funds going to illegals or cities trying to pass anti-gun laws and organize around those fronts
[01:17:04.645 --> 01:17:09.230]  You can organize neighborhoods on national issues as well, and just get involved.
[01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:11.552]  I mean, I'm no master community organizer.
[01:17:11.552 --> 01:17:17.397]  That's why the globalists chose Obama, not just that he's smart and slick and well-spoken and can read a teleprompter well.
[01:17:17.397 --> 01:17:22.122]  He is a master Annenberg, Rockefeller, Ford Foundation operative.
[01:17:22.122 --> 01:17:26.466]  So his mother worked for Geithner's father.
[01:17:27.731 --> 01:17:30.534]  I mean, he's been a foundation baby from birth.
[01:17:30.534 --> 01:17:38.103]  He's been a globalist creature, being groomed from the time he was a little boy.
[01:17:38.103 --> 01:17:39.705]  That's what's so dangerous about Obama.
[01:17:39.705 --> 01:17:41.427]  I mean, he is the slickest thing we've seen.
[01:17:41.427 --> 01:17:42.748]  He's New World Order all the way.
[01:17:42.748 --> 01:17:47.053]  And again, I spent all those years exposing Clinton, exposing Bush as puppets.
[01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:54.293]  But it's really hard to expose Obama because so many people have gone under his spell, drunk the Kool-Aid.
[01:17:54.293 --> 01:17:57.134]  But his approval rating is plunging, so that's a good thing.
[01:17:57.134 --> 01:18:01.696]  It's not a good thing, though, if we just blame it all on Obama.
[01:18:01.696 --> 01:18:08.159]  But if we tear him down as a puppet and point out he's a liar and gone back on almost all his promises, that's a good thing.
[01:18:08.159 --> 01:18:11.620]  But they mean to build him up and then tear him down and then move on to the next puppet.
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:14.321]  We need to expose the whole puppet system itself.
[01:18:14.321 --> 01:18:15.562]  I appreciate your call, Chris.
[01:18:17.190 --> 01:18:20.172]  Antoine in Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:18:20.172 --> 01:18:21.633]  Hey, how you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:18:21.633 --> 01:18:22.893]  Good, Antoine.
[01:18:22.893 --> 01:18:26.615]  Hey, well, we know how you're doing, but, uh, hey, listen, this is my thing.
[01:18:26.615 --> 01:18:32.099]  You know how we use YouTube as a way to kind of get our message out, and it's very effective.
[01:18:32.099 --> 01:18:34.140]  You know, it's something that we know is controlled.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:38.702]  We know that people's, you know, behind it, just kind of behind the scenes watch what we're doing.
[01:18:38.702 --> 01:18:40.483]  Why don't we use C-SPAN?
[01:18:40.483 --> 01:18:46.507]  I mean, I was watching C-SPAN one day, and, you know, they got a few calls in a row of people who's talking about our issues.
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:54.606]  And I mean, the people that they had on there, that they were interviewing, that they were, you know, putting calls through on, they're turning red and stuttering.
[01:18:54.606 --> 01:18:55.847]  They're not prepared.
[01:18:55.847 --> 01:18:59.590]  Well, actually, C-SPAN's discussed cutting back their call shows.
[01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:11.360]  I have been sent online clips of entire hour-long shows where 90-plus percent of the callers are calling in saying 9-11's an inside job and bringing up very serious points.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:15.821]  And it completely shuts down Chertoff, when he was on a month ago, and others.
[01:19:15.821 --> 01:19:17.061]  And you're right.
[01:19:17.061 --> 01:19:23.223]  C-SPAN is a great way to reach hundreds of thousands of people, or millions total, if you call in throughout the week.
[01:19:23.223 --> 01:19:27.825]  But they have millions of people that tune in every day, hundreds of thousands at a time.
[01:19:27.825 --> 01:19:30.765]  And C-SPAN is a wonderful place to call in.
[01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:32.186]  But so is talk radio.
[01:19:32.186 --> 01:19:34.446]  Liberal, conservative, NPR.
[01:19:34.446 --> 01:19:35.207]  Absolutely.
[01:19:35.207 --> 01:19:36.127]  Letters to the editor.
[01:19:36.687 --> 01:19:38.389]  Commenting on message boards.
[01:19:38.389 --> 01:19:40.591]  We don't have to save the world by ourselves.
[01:19:40.591 --> 01:19:42.673]  It's many hands make light work.
[01:19:42.673 --> 01:19:45.135]  We are the majority.
[01:19:45.135 --> 01:19:47.877]  Anything else you want to add, Antoine?
[01:19:47.877 --> 01:19:48.498]  Stay there.
[01:19:48.498 --> 01:19:48.838]  Stay there.
[01:19:48.838 --> 01:19:49.819]  I gotta go to break.
[01:19:49.819 --> 01:19:50.760]  Stay on hold.
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:54.403]  We'll come back to Antoine, Dan, Ronnie, Steve, many others.
[01:19:54.403 --> 01:19:54.543]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:19:54.543 --> 01:19:55.124]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:55.124 --> 01:19:56.425]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[01:20:02.979 --> 01:20:04.480]  About not starving.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:11.444]  To cover yourself and your family in the event of accidents or emergency, you may have home, life, auto, dental and health insurance.
[01:20:11.444 --> 01:20:13.145]  But what about food insurance?
[01:20:13.145 --> 01:20:15.486]  Water and food are vital to human survival.
[01:20:15.486 --> 01:20:18.008]  So what's so crazy about not starving?
[01:20:18.228 --> 01:20:24.630]  Foodinsurance.com has designed emergency packs and kits with at least two weeks worth of great-tasting food and clean water.

[01:21:01.058 --> 01:21:04.241]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about Graff Hunter safes.

[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:02.881]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:02.881 --> 01:22:08.408]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:08.408 --> 01:22:08.969]  I get it.
[01:22:08.969 --> 01:22:18.581]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:18.581 --> 01:22:19.743]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:19.983 --> 01:22:28.449]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:28.449 --> 01:22:31.851]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:31.851 --> 01:22:36.114]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:36.114 --> 01:22:37.716]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:37.716 --> 01:22:41.678]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:41.678 --> 01:22:45.281]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:46.383]  You should, too.
[01:22:46.383 --> 01:22:47.524]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:47.524 --> 01:22:50.910]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:51.170]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.170 --> 01:22:51.230]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.230 --> 01:22:51.431]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:07.702]  If you believe Obama is creating runaway inflation, I'll tell you how to profit from this insanity with a free kit.
[01:23:07.702 --> 01:23:08.943]  First, the facts.
[01:23:08.943 --> 01:23:11.604]  Obama is spending like a drunken sailor.
[01:23:11.604 --> 01:23:17.186]  $700 billion for TARP, $122 billion for AIG, more for Fannie and Freddie.
[01:23:17.186 --> 01:23:18.026]  The result?
[01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:23.788]  A deficit of over $1.8 trillion and the probability of interest rates going above 18% and inflation above 20%.
[01:23:26.389 --> 01:23:27.850]  Now the good news.
[01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:37.174]  Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential, an investment newsletter, created a free inflation survival kit.
[01:23:37.174 --> 01:23:43.137]  The kit outlines how these circumstances created opportunities to turn $10,000 into as much as $431,000 in 12 to 18 months.
[01:23:43.137 --> 01:23:45.518]  If you're thinking about gold, get this free kit now by calling 888-314-8782.
[01:23:45.518 --> 01:23:45.718]  That's 888-314-8782.
[01:23:55.382 --> 01:23:59.903]  Okay, let's go back to Antoine in Georgia.
[01:23:59.903 --> 01:24:12.125]  Antoine, you had another point you wanted to make, sir.
[01:24:12.125 --> 01:24:17.827]  Yeah, well, you know, I just think that, you know, this Sunday we should really just do a C-SPAN blitz.
[01:24:17.827 --> 01:24:20.847]  You know, just to see these people turn red and start stuttering.
[01:24:20.847 --> 01:24:23.428]  Like, they're not prepared for our issues.
[01:24:23.428 --> 01:24:24.268]  They're prepared for
[01:24:33.195 --> 01:24:37.176]  That's a good point.
[01:24:37.176 --> 01:24:41.457]  It's like a boxing commentator for Don King who already knows who's going to win.
[01:24:41.457 --> 01:24:52.941]  It's easy for them to call the punches when it's only about Republicans and Democrats and they're desperate to keep it in those confines, in that paradigm, instead of going, wait a minute, there's more choices in this.
[01:24:52.941 --> 01:24:54.041]  There's more going on.
[01:24:54.821 --> 01:25:02.363]  Then Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and Bonner and Obama and Newt Gingrich and all these people.
[01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:05.644]  There's more going on than Fox News and CNN.
[01:25:05.644 --> 01:25:07.724]  There's more than what you give us.
[01:25:07.724 --> 01:25:10.045]  You're trying to limit the debate.
[01:25:10.045 --> 01:25:11.565]  We want the bankers arrested.
[01:25:11.565 --> 01:25:13.526]  We want the Federal Reserve abolished.
[01:25:13.526 --> 01:25:16.207]  We don't want a cap and trade paid to Al Gore.
[01:25:16.207 --> 01:25:17.147]  We want C-SPAN
[01:25:17.887 --> 01:25:24.713]  To have a symposium with the 30 plus thousand scientists that have gone public saying man-made global warming is a fraud.
[01:25:24.713 --> 01:25:26.014]  And you can read the times.
[01:25:26.014 --> 01:25:30.579]  A lot of times on C-SPAN they randomly go live after a live event ends.
[01:25:30.579 --> 01:25:34.022]  They will then cut back to the studio unannounced with a guest.
[01:25:34.022 --> 01:25:35.143]  They have some set times.
[01:25:35.143 --> 01:25:37.185]  Washington Journal in the morning, seven days a week.
[01:25:37.725 --> 01:25:38.045]  I don't think so.
[01:25:57.631 --> 01:25:59.232]  They do cover some anti-war groups.
[01:25:59.232 --> 01:26:00.633]  They do cover some 9-11 groups.
[01:26:00.633 --> 01:26:03.194]  They do cover some great authors.
[01:26:03.194 --> 01:26:07.517]  So it's the best thing out there, but that isn't saying much compared to what it's running up against.
[01:26:07.517 --> 01:26:10.199]  We need to have everybody.
[01:26:10.199 --> 01:26:10.879]  Why wait?
[01:26:10.879 --> 01:26:13.081]  Why not have everybody?
[01:26:13.081 --> 01:26:15.162]  There's no orders from headquarters here.
[01:26:15.162 --> 01:26:17.984]  Anybody who's off work tomorrow or works in the afternoon or evening,
[01:26:18.911 --> 01:26:20.613]  Washington Journal.
[01:26:20.613 --> 01:26:22.015]  What, it goes for two hours?
[01:26:22.015 --> 01:26:23.877]  From what, six to eight?
[01:26:23.877 --> 01:26:26.080]  Is it Eastern?
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:32.768]  Everybody tomorrow, get up early in the morning, get a cup of Joe, sit down in front of the television, tune to C-SPAN 1 or 2.
[01:26:32.768 --> 01:26:36.212]  I forget, I think it's on C-SPAN 1, and hit them and hit them hard.
[01:26:38.916 --> 01:26:49.384]  They'll start screening the calls once they see that we take over, but just weasel past them, get on air, and that's a great idea, Antoine.
[01:26:49.384 --> 01:26:50.925]  Anything else?
[01:26:50.925 --> 01:26:53.307]  Yeah, well, let's just hit them with a bunch of fiat stuff.
[01:26:53.307 --> 01:26:54.949]  You know, ask them about the fiat currency.
[01:26:54.949 --> 01:26:55.809]  That really gets them.
[01:26:55.809 --> 01:27:00.053]  So, you know, if there's an economist on, say, what do you think about the fiat currency?
[01:27:00.053 --> 01:27:01.774]  But that's really all I had, Alex.
[01:27:01.774 --> 01:27:04.396]  I appreciate everything that you're doing, and I love the movie.
[01:27:04.396 --> 01:27:05.477]  I'm making copies as we speak.
[01:27:06.004 --> 01:27:07.644]  God bless you, Antoine.
[01:27:07.644 --> 01:27:10.045]  All right, let's talk to Dan in New Mexico.
[01:27:10.045 --> 01:27:11.005]  Dan, you're on the air.
[01:27:11.005 --> 01:27:12.345]  Go ahead.
[01:27:12.345 --> 01:27:15.606]  My goodness, Alex, you are just phenomenal.
[01:27:15.606 --> 01:27:16.806]  Oh, come on!
[01:27:16.806 --> 01:27:18.006]  No, I'm not.
[01:27:18.006 --> 01:27:19.127]  No, hold on now.
[01:27:19.127 --> 01:27:25.848]  I know you hate being complimented on, but take a look at yourself in the mirror and look at how much stuff you know.
[01:27:25.848 --> 01:27:33.510]  I watched you the other day on PresidentPlanet.tv come up with an article from back in 98, 99, just off the top of your head.
[01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:35.070]  I can hardly remember what I did yesterday.
[01:27:36.648 --> 01:27:38.132]  Thank you, man.
[01:27:38.132 --> 01:27:41.740]  You have really been touched by the old man upstairs and you're really touching a lot of other people.
[01:27:42.443 --> 01:27:48.166]  Well, I do have, you know, we all have blessings, we all have gifts, and I do have gifts, and I don't use them to the full potential.
[01:27:48.166 --> 01:27:50.547]  I also have a lot of minuses.
[01:27:50.547 --> 01:27:54.630]  You know, we have our pluses and minuses, and I'm trying to use my gifts.
[01:27:54.630 --> 01:27:56.591]  But we all should use our gifts.
[01:27:56.591 --> 01:28:02.154]  I mean, a lot of people can remember a football play from the Super Bowl in 1997.
[01:28:02.154 --> 01:28:09.117]  So, I'm just using the same part of my brain for real issues that the average person fills up with mindless clutter.
[01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:11.579]  And I'm not saying you can't watch a ball game and eat a pizza and
[01:28:12.139 --> 01:28:14.361]  Drink a cold one and spend time with your family.
[01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:16.822]  I'm just saying, that doesn't matter.
[01:28:16.822 --> 01:28:20.345]  You should spend a lot more time on real issues.
[01:28:20.345 --> 01:28:26.028]  Every now and again, I've got to take a break from fighting this NWO and go play video games or something.
[01:28:26.028 --> 01:28:33.073]  But the reason I called you, man, is because I wanted to let you know that I'm here in Alamogordo, New Mexico.
[01:28:33.073 --> 01:28:35.415]  I'm part of a group that's been started up down here called the
[01:28:36.731 --> 01:28:47.959]  Second Amendment Task Force that actually started in Alaska and has spread down here to... And just like We Are Change, those type of groups could spread nationwide and take America back.
[01:28:47.959 --> 01:28:48.300]  Awesome.
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:49.801]  Tell me about it.
[01:28:49.801 --> 01:28:52.863]  Oh, we, uh, up in Alaska, when I was a group up there,
[01:28:53.723 --> 01:28:55.365]  The Fourth of July Parade.
[01:28:55.365 --> 01:29:02.635]  We openly carried guns in the parade and my goodness, Alex, you should have seen the crowd go absolutely nuts.
[01:29:02.635 --> 01:29:03.837]  People loved it.
[01:29:03.837 --> 01:29:06.120]  I was carrying my AR in the crowd.
[01:29:09.705 --> 01:29:13.088]  Let me stop you, let me stop you.
[01:29:13.088 --> 01:29:14.569]  You know why this is great?
[01:29:14.569 --> 01:29:16.050]  They're engaged in pushback.
[01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:22.295]  They're trying to act like guns are pornography and you gotta put it in a black bag and hide it like it's bad.
[01:29:22.295 --> 01:29:23.296]  And they're even taking...
[01:29:24.398 --> 01:29:30.842]  Dummy guns away from veterans for parades saying they can't have a gun in a parade even though it's legal and lawful.
[01:29:30.842 --> 01:29:34.044]  The real guns you got to worry about are the hidden ones with criminals.
[01:29:34.044 --> 01:29:42.149]  But by you guys going out and forcing firearms into plain view, that pushes back so that people understand guns aren't dirty or illegal.
[01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:48.893]  If you don't do what you're doing, the cable guy comes to your house, sees a gun case, thinks guns are illegal, calls the cops on you.
[01:29:48.893 --> 01:29:51.175]  The media is trying to create the perception that guns are illegal.
[01:29:51.175 --> 01:29:51.495]  Stay there.
[01:29:51.815 --> 01:29:55.744]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.744 --> 01:29:58.430]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.684 --> 01:30:04.705]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.705 --> 01:30:10.027]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:10.027 --> 01:30:12.067]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:12.067 --> 01:30:17.069]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:17.069 --> 01:30:18.249]  How much do you want?
[01:30:18.249 --> 01:30:19.390]  When do you want it?
[01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:21.270]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:22.350]  When will you need it?
[01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:24.551]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.551 --> 01:30:25.892]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.892 --> 01:30:27.192]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:27.412 --> 01:30:32.679]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.679 --> 01:30:36.264]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:40.089]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:40.089 --> 01:30:41.311]  How much will you need?
[01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:42.212]  We don't know.
[01:30:42.212 --> 01:30:43.334]  How much do you want?
[01:30:43.334 --> 01:30:44.074]  All you can get.
[01:30:44.074 --> 01:30:45.056]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:45.336 --> 01:30:48.378]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:31:00.626 --> 01:31:04.728]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.

[01:32:00.433 --> 01:32:05.740]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:10.266]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:10.266 --> 01:32:12.549]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:12.549 --> 01:32:14.171]  You don't have to cooperate.

[01:33:25.721 --> 01:33:38.367]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, medical doctor, one of the leading whistleblowers on the dangerous side effects of the vaccine program, not just H1N1, will be in studio coming up in one hour.
[01:33:38.367 --> 01:33:40.027]  Looking forward to that.
[01:33:40.027 --> 01:33:41.168]  We'll also open the phones up.
[01:33:41.168 --> 01:33:47.591]  And we're going to go back to Dan, Ronnie, Steve, Reese, GIA, and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:33:47.591 --> 01:33:51.813]  I first want to spend a few minutes giving you my boildown, my take,
[01:33:53.482 --> 01:33:58.966]  On what really happened with Major Nidal Malik Hassan at Fort Hood last Thursday.
[01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:10.094]  And I haven't spoken a lot about this because I don't like to talk about something until I've had time to research it and look at it and let it stew in my mind.
[01:34:10.094 --> 01:34:15.418]  I'm not like a lot of talk show hosts that will just tell you immediately what's going on and they have really no idea.
[01:34:16.428 --> 01:34:19.070]  But I will tell you, it doesn't look good right now.
[01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:22.073]  I also want to hit some important financial news here in a moment.
[01:34:22.073 --> 01:34:27.457]  But first, let's go back to Dan in New Mexico, because I want to be clear about this.
[01:34:27.457 --> 01:34:41.188]  For over a decade, I've been all over the United States and I've seen photos of this in England and Germany and other places, Australia, where they put up big billboards that have an image of a revolver.
[01:34:42.697 --> 01:34:49.499]  And it says, report illegal guns, get $5,000, $10,000, there's generally a cash reward.
[01:34:49.499 --> 01:35:09.825]  In tiny print, if you stand right under the billboard, as I saw one a few years ago and took photos of it, we posted it at Infowars.com, I was in Galveston, down at the beach with my family, and they had one right by the Galvez Hotel, big huge billboard, right on boardwalk, right on the main
[01:35:11.169 --> 01:35:11.629]  What's it called?
[01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:14.991]  Seawall Road, right on the main seawall.
[01:35:14.991 --> 01:35:22.796]  And it showed an image of a revolver and it said, report illegal guns, get large rewards.
[01:35:22.796 --> 01:35:38.366]  And under it, in tiny print, I mean, I've got 20-20 vision and standing 30-40 feet below it, I had to focus to read, you will be eligible if the individuals are convicted for committing crimes with guns.
[01:35:39.946 --> 01:35:42.006]  But it said, report illegal guns.
[01:35:42.006 --> 01:35:46.427]  The fine print said, report guns used in crimes.
[01:35:46.427 --> 01:35:52.669]  Now, that's why, nine years ago, I had a carpet cleaner in my house.
[01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:57.950]  Back then, I did my radio show out of a studio room, in a bedroom of the house.
[01:35:57.950 --> 01:36:09.072]  And, I didn't have children then, and there was a loaded, pump-action, Winchester, black, Defender shotgun.
[01:36:13.914 --> 01:36:17.140]  Loaded.
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:18.342]  In a gun rack.
[01:36:18.342 --> 01:36:21.147]  Up on the wall.
[01:36:21.147 --> 01:36:24.713]  I love having children, but I really loved back in the days when I used to have loaded guns all over the place.
[01:36:25.936 --> 01:36:27.596]  Now they're locked up.
[01:36:27.596 --> 01:36:29.777]  Instant access pistol safes.
[01:36:29.777 --> 01:36:32.217]  The .45, the .357 mag, the Judge.
[01:36:32.217 --> 01:36:32.878]  Different rooms.
[01:36:32.878 --> 01:36:37.179]  I just want to warn anybody, because I know people said go to my house and kill me and stuff.
[01:36:37.179 --> 01:36:38.779]  That's a popular thing on the internet.
[01:36:38.779 --> 01:36:42.780]  Well, I'm not saying bring it on, but you better watch your ass.
[01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:43.860]  Excuse me, I apologize.
[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:47.901]  Because if I catch you in my yard or trying to break into my house, I will not hesitate.
[01:36:47.901 --> 01:36:49.001]  You are going to die.
[01:36:49.001 --> 01:36:49.641]  Do you understand?
[01:36:49.641 --> 01:36:51.042]  Do you understand me?
[01:36:51.042 --> 01:36:51.862]  I will kill you.
[01:36:53.732 --> 01:36:56.914]  I've got a strong survival instinct for my family and myself.
[01:36:56.914 --> 01:36:57.834]  You understand?
[01:36:57.834 --> 01:36:59.075]  Side issue.
[01:36:59.075 --> 01:37:03.757]  The point is, this guy sees it, starts saying, I'm not going to clean this room.
[01:37:03.757 --> 01:37:06.459]  What's that shotgun doing?
[01:37:06.459 --> 01:37:07.259]  He was a white guy.
[01:37:07.259 --> 01:37:08.640]  He had a Hispanic assistant.
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:13.722]  That's how the carpet cleaner place worked, because I'd worked for him actually in college.
[01:37:13.722 --> 01:37:15.063]  And I say, no, guns are legal.
[01:37:15.063 --> 01:37:17.064]  And he said, I'm still not going in there.
[01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:20.206]  I said, I know it's a black gun and looks scary, but it's not scary.
[01:37:21.331 --> 01:37:22.352]  I assure you it's legal.
[01:37:22.352 --> 01:37:23.172]  And he starts freaking out.
[01:37:23.172 --> 01:37:24.873]  And I said, look, here I am in the front page of the paper.
[01:37:24.873 --> 01:37:26.394]  I've just been at a gun rally.
[01:37:26.394 --> 01:37:29.016]  And I was on the front page of the Metro and State.
[01:37:29.016 --> 01:37:32.418]  I'd caught bribery at the Capitol, and I was in the paper for that on video.
[01:37:32.418 --> 01:37:33.218]  It was pretty famous.
[01:37:33.218 --> 01:37:34.799]  Made it all over national news.
[01:37:34.799 --> 01:37:36.220]  And I said, see, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:36.781]  It's not illegal.
[01:37:37.594 --> 01:37:39.336]  He leaves.
[01:37:39.336 --> 01:37:40.097]  I call the office.
[01:37:40.097 --> 01:37:41.758]  They go, no, we didn't call the police on you.
[01:37:41.758 --> 01:37:44.701]  He didn't understand the law, but yes, we almost called the police on you.
[01:37:44.701 --> 01:37:45.702]  But we're going to do you a favor.
[01:37:45.702 --> 01:37:47.284]  We're not going to call the police this time.
[01:37:47.284 --> 01:37:49.266]  Then I'm on AXS TV that night.
[01:37:49.266 --> 01:37:53.230]  His helper calls in and says, yeah, I argued with him and got fired.
[01:37:53.230 --> 01:37:55.513]  They did call the police on you, but they didn't come.
[01:37:56.536 --> 01:37:58.177]  Now, that's American.
[01:37:58.177 --> 01:38:00.118]  I know I've told that story 50 times, probably.
[01:38:00.118 --> 01:38:02.860]  I tell it because you're in danger, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:13.928]  Most people watch sitcoms and dramas and NYPD Blue and LA Law and all this stuff, based in New York, where in the make-believe world, no guns are legal.
[01:38:13.928 --> 01:38:17.090]  And so they are ignorant and think your guns are illegal.
[01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:24.575]  All right, I said I'd get to what happened in Fort Hood, but the issue here is, they are teaching everyone guns are illegal.
[01:38:28.462 --> 01:38:38.229]  They are teaching everyone that they're already banned.
[01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:40.491]  That's a foregone conclusion.
[01:38:40.491 --> 01:38:52.119]  And by folks nationwide from New Hampshire to Vermont, from Texas to Arizona, New Mexico, California, carrying guns out in the open.
[01:38:52.119 --> 01:38:55.161]  You know, I didn't like one of the leaders of the Black Panthers.
[01:38:55.161 --> 01:38:55.721]  He's dead now.
[01:38:55.721 --> 01:38:56.262]  What's his name?
[01:38:59.184 --> 01:38:59.785]  I forget his name.
[01:38:59.785 --> 01:39:09.493]  The point is he had a march with loaded shotguns in Houston and the police stood down because that was the Second Amendment right.
[01:39:09.493 --> 01:39:15.578]  And as much as I didn't like that racist guy, most Black Panthers really aren't racist, but that fellow was.
[01:39:15.578 --> 01:39:16.238]  What was his name?
[01:39:16.238 --> 01:39:26.507]  He did the famous speech, the debate with Anthony Hilder where he said you have to kill all the white women and all the white babies because the white woman is the military manufacturing center.
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:34.603]  The issue is though, you've got to really worry about the people that have guns hidden.
[01:39:34.603 --> 01:39:40.966]  That's why under common law, an openly bared arms, that's why it's keep and bare, you have to show your arms.
[01:39:40.966 --> 01:39:43.188]  What's illegal is hiding them.
[01:39:43.188 --> 01:39:46.850]  It is illegal under common law and illegal under the Constitution.
[01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:50.032]  And if we want to repeal that, that's fine.
[01:39:50.032 --> 01:39:52.693]  But the point is, it's hidden weapons that are illegal.
[01:39:52.693 --> 01:39:56.736]  We're supposed to be a culture where you bare arms openly and that's a very secure society.
[01:39:57.671 --> 01:40:00.152]  Alright, briefly going back to Dan in New Mexico.
[01:40:00.152 --> 01:40:01.953]  Dan, go ahead.
[01:40:01.953 --> 01:40:07.296]  I just wanted to comment on your black illegal shotgun you have.
[01:40:07.296 --> 01:40:09.977]  I got the same thing sitting right next to my bed.
[01:40:09.977 --> 01:40:12.218]  And I also have guns hidden all around my house, so.
[01:40:12.218 --> 01:40:15.880]  You know, it's not a... People don't understand.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:19.481]  Even right now with our group, people are like, oh my gosh, you can open carry guns?
[01:40:19.481 --> 01:40:21.542]  Yeah, we're an open carry state.
[01:40:21.542 --> 01:40:23.043]  But that's the whole point of the group.
[01:40:23.763 --> 01:40:36.128]  Is get people educated about what the Second Amendment means, it's true meaning and purpose, and we also do things like open carry events, where we just pick a day and openly carry.
[01:40:36.128 --> 01:40:42.510]  Now, when Schaeffer Cox did this same thing up in Fairbanks, Alaska, he had two different banks in Walmart call him.
[01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:52.994]  The first bank was nervous and didn't really know why they were calling him, but the second one was ecstatic and loved it because the manager told him that he'd never felt more safe in his bank than he did that day.
[01:40:53.755 --> 01:40:56.157]  Wal-Mart was ecstatic.
[01:40:56.157 --> 01:41:04.362]  The manager of the place was so happy about it, he took pictures of it, sent it to corporate Wal-Mart, asked them for permission for the employees to take part in it.
[01:41:04.362 --> 01:41:06.803]  But, you've got to realize, Alaska is a little bit different.
[01:41:06.803 --> 01:41:10.165]  They're very, very, very Second Amendment orientated.
[01:41:10.165 --> 01:41:15.809]  They've got grizzly bears, and polar bears, and wolves, and everything else they've got to deal with.
[01:41:15.809 --> 01:41:22.633]  And we're going to do another parade down here in Alamogordo, a Christmas Day parade, openly carrying.
[01:41:23.848 --> 01:41:28.090]  We're going to adopt a highway where we probably openly carry and go out and pick up the trash.
[01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:30.751]  We want to be a positive light in the community.
[01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:33.392]  We'd also like to see this spread nationwide more.
[01:41:33.392 --> 01:41:38.394]  It's in Montana and Florida as well.
[01:41:38.394 --> 01:41:40.835]  Just go to Anchorage2ATF.org or go to Alamogordo2ATF.org.
[01:41:45.959 --> 01:41:50.260]  Hook up some, pick a person to talk to and we'll help spread the word.
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:51.360]  Good job my friend.
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.501]  I got to jump, but great job.
[01:41:53.501 --> 01:41:55.602]  You're saving this country.
[01:41:55.602 --> 01:41:59.363]  It's that type of action that's unstoppable at the grassroots level.
[01:41:59.363 --> 01:42:08.305]  Okay, I want to get into the Fort Hood shooting and break down what I really think is happening here, but I want to bring Ted Anderson briefly on for Midas Resources, the parent company of the GCN Radio Network.
[01:42:08.305 --> 01:42:10.185]  I've known Ted for 13 years.
[01:42:10.185 --> 01:42:11.726]  I have syndicated through him for 12.
[01:42:13.482 --> 01:42:22.950]  He has been a great supporter of myself, Ron Paul, but the reason I buy my gold and silver from Ted Anderson is he has the best prices when he has these special offers.
[01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:31.197]  He always has great prices, very competitive, but the deals he's giving you today are bar none off the chart good, and gold is up again today.
[01:42:34.809 --> 01:42:41.331]  It's up $7.60 to $1,113 and change.
[01:42:41.331 --> 01:42:46.232]  This is so exciting what is happening right now.
[01:42:46.232 --> 01:42:57.655]  And I just want to encourage everybody to take advantage of today's gold offer because he was offering even better deals a few weeks ago, but this deal is about to go and there'll be more.
[01:42:57.655 --> 01:43:00.796]  And all the smart money's on gold and silver.
[01:43:00.796 --> 01:43:01.356]  Ted Anderson.
[01:43:02.031 --> 01:43:03.453]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:43:03.453 --> 01:43:16.407]  If anybody looks at Money and Investing in the Wall Street Journal today, they'll see that there's a headline article right on the very front page, Central Banks Join the New Gold Rush, and there's a big long list of all the central banks.
[01:43:16.854 --> 01:43:17.855]  that are buying gold.
[01:43:17.855 --> 01:43:32.545]  And if the people that are making the money, I mean manufacturing the money, creating it, think that you should have gold, what do you think the regular people in the world should be doing when they have to spend their currency as a resource for their own wealth?
[01:43:33.025 --> 01:43:34.527]  You should be getting into gold.
[01:43:34.527 --> 01:43:42.697]  I mean, there's just absolutely very few reasons, very few arguments that even hold water anymore as to why you should stay away from it.
[01:43:42.697 --> 01:43:44.419]  It is, again, like you said, running today.
[01:43:44.419 --> 01:43:45.180]  It's been as high as $1,119.
[01:43:50.217 --> 01:44:02.071]  The British Sovereigns, Franks, Walking Liberties, the Lakota Coins, the Eagles, the Maple Leafs, you name it, the Buffalo Coins, all that stuff is going up in value if you can get them.
[01:44:02.071 --> 01:44:07.317]  I'm constantly hearing from my associates here, my brokers,
[01:44:07.737 --> 01:44:11.298]  That they're saying that people are stopping into the local shops now and again.
[01:44:11.298 --> 01:44:13.179]  It's like it was a couple years ago.
[01:44:13.179 --> 01:44:15.519]  There's nothing left in inventory for people to buy.
[01:44:15.519 --> 01:44:18.320]  I just think that's sad and unfortunate.
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:26.663]  But people will and should and better be acting fast and getting away from the fiat currency like your caller had just said earlier.
[01:44:27.143 --> 01:44:29.926]  Get away from that fiat currency and get into gold.
[01:44:29.926 --> 01:44:31.848]  Right now, the francs are at $246.
[01:44:31.848 --> 01:44:34.851]  I mean, my inventory's not going to last long.
[01:44:34.851 --> 01:44:35.631]  Gold's up again.
[01:44:35.631 --> 01:44:36.753]  It's going to be higher.
[01:44:36.753 --> 01:44:38.875]  British sovereigns are at $299.
[01:44:38.875 --> 01:44:40.917]  I mean, I priced those, Alex, and they were close to $330.
[01:44:43.639 --> 01:44:51.522]  If I just take them in today's market at today's prices, you know, and I'm wishing, I'm hoping to get a lower price to buy again.
[01:44:51.522 --> 01:44:52.843]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:44:52.843 --> 01:44:58.625]  Even though you're buying in giant bulk, you couldn't buy these coins for what you're selling them to people for.
[01:44:59.005 --> 01:45:04.266]  No, because the premium on physical gold coins is going up like crazy.
[01:45:04.266 --> 01:45:08.607]  Every dealer in the United States right now is competing for a finite supply.
[01:45:08.607 --> 01:45:12.788]  There's just not enough being manufactured to meet the demand.
[01:45:12.788 --> 01:45:21.270]  And that's why people who are stopping into the local jewelry stores and coin shops aren't finding coins, because the little bit that they had in inventory is gone now.
[01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:23.592]  Well, Ted, let's rewind to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:45:23.592 --> 01:45:25.073]  I happen to have the article in front of me.
[01:45:25.073 --> 01:45:29.356]  Central banks are taking taxpayer bailout fiat money, but it's real money because we've got to pay for it in taxes.
[01:45:50.356 --> 01:45:51.598]  That's what the health care scam is.
[01:45:51.598 --> 01:45:52.899]  It's just a new tax.
[01:45:52.899 --> 01:46:00.949]  They want to take 2.5 to 5 percent out of your check and make you buy insurance and put you in prison for five years if you don't get it and a quarter million dollar fine.
[01:46:00.949 --> 01:46:02.411]  That's in the bill!
[01:46:02.411 --> 01:46:03.973]  And they're marking it up November 17th.
[01:46:03.973 --> 01:46:05.435]  They're going to try to pass it November 17th.
[01:46:06.916 --> 01:46:08.457]  I'm sorry to go off into that subject.
[01:46:08.457 --> 01:46:10.018]  It's just we are in deep trouble.
[01:46:10.018 --> 01:46:13.419]  They're going to try to pass cap and trade right around that same period.
[01:46:13.419 --> 01:46:14.740]  It's passed the House.
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:16.300]  All it's got to do is pass the Senate.
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:21.103]  They have the razor blade, the butcher knife, razor sharp to our jugular.
[01:46:21.903 --> 01:46:38.720]  To our carotid arteries right now and you know with all these horrible things happening at least we can do what the big boys are doing just on a smaller scale and get into gold and silver because they're taking our bailout money and they, the central banks, are buying gold.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:43.264]  Now in the past they've sold it to try to keep the price down amongst themselves in a manipulation.
[01:46:43.985 --> 01:46:45.306]  That's not happening.
[01:46:45.306 --> 01:46:46.066]  What was it?
[01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:53.450]  $400 plus billion was dumped on the market and one country bought half of that.
[01:46:53.450 --> 01:46:54.770]  India did.
[01:46:54.770 --> 01:47:00.753]  They didn't think folks were going to do that two weeks ago, a week and a half ago, trying to drive down the price.
[01:47:00.753 --> 01:47:02.994]  Now the yuppies are beginning to pile on.
[01:47:02.994 --> 01:47:07.076]  Now the mainline TV host is saying it's going to go above $2,000.
[01:47:07.076 --> 01:47:08.197]  I don't know if that's going to happen.
[01:47:08.999 --> 01:47:13.601]  I just said a year ago it was going to go above 1,000 and was going to climb.
[01:47:13.601 --> 01:47:18.023]  We're now could easily by the end of the year see 1,200 or even higher.
[01:47:18.023 --> 01:47:21.685]  The issue here is you need to get involved.
[01:47:21.685 --> 01:47:25.567]  These are great deals on bullion prices of gold.
[01:47:25.987 --> 01:47:29.769]  But these aren't just bullion, these are collectible or semi-collectible coins.
[01:47:29.769 --> 01:47:34.812]  Some of these coins that I've gotten from Ted, when I buy a few francs for a few sovereigns, you know, these are 1888.
[01:47:34.812 --> 01:47:41.675]  Ted, am I correct, because my red book says they are a collectible coin, how are you selling them then at bullion price?
[01:47:41.675 --> 01:47:44.817]  Well, you know, like I said, I use my purchasing power.
[01:47:44.817 --> 01:47:47.278]  A lot of them I have to import from Europe.
[01:47:47.278 --> 01:47:49.119]  Those coins go well back into the 1800s.
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:51.721]  And for a lot
[01:48:05.988 --> 01:48:09.809]  Three days ago, you're losing money today because you'll pay a lot more for it.
[01:48:09.809 --> 01:48:11.910]  And that's just the way that it is.
[01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:18.612]  By waiting and thinking that you can put off purchasing gold and silver, it is costing you a tremendous amount of money.
[01:48:18.612 --> 01:48:26.114]  If you hadn't done it in the last six months, you've already lost about 25% of your purchasing power against gold and silver.
[01:48:26.114 --> 01:48:28.355]  I mean, I don't know how to make it more clear than this for you.
[01:48:28.735 --> 01:48:35.160]  The market is moving up, the dollar is moving down, the government is trying to bail out its problems by printing more money.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.001]  What do you think is going to happen in the future?
[01:48:37.001 --> 01:48:40.344]  I mean, we've increased our money supply by 2 to 1.
[01:48:40.344 --> 01:48:45.367]  There are $2 now to buy what it used to take, what there used to be 1 in the marketplace.
[01:48:45.367 --> 01:48:47.489]  What do you think the cost of items are going to be?
[01:48:47.489 --> 01:48:53.213]  You know, it's going to drive the price up, or realistically speaking, we're going to lose 50% of our purchasing power.
[01:48:53.453 --> 01:49:03.795]  Ted, I know you don't have a crystal ball, and there are mainline analysts on CNBC, MSNBC, CNN, saying $7,000 gold in the next two years.
[01:49:03.795 --> 01:49:05.635]  I don't believe that's going to happen.
[01:49:05.635 --> 01:49:15.917]  None of us have a crystal ball, but 30 years in gold and silver, what do you really, and I understand this is not a prediction, it's what you think, where do you think gold will be next fall?
[01:49:15.917 --> 01:49:18.578]  Well, by next fall, we'll probably be poking through that $2,000 range.
[01:49:22.032 --> 01:49:24.355]  $1,200 an ounce before the end of the year, probably $1,300.
[01:49:24.355 --> 01:49:26.957]  I mean, I'm just watching what's going on.
[01:49:26.957 --> 01:49:34.965]  It broke through that $1,110 and then I thought, okay, it might back off if it's acting like it has been in the past.
[01:49:34.965 --> 01:49:36.767]  Maybe we'll see $1,099 or something like that.
[01:49:39.269 --> 01:49:39.629]  Exactly.
[01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:40.550]  They tried to drive it down.
[01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:41.431]  The bluff blew up in their face.
[01:50:02.945 --> 01:50:04.847]  India took the pot.
[01:50:04.847 --> 01:50:06.328]  It looks like game over.
[01:50:06.328 --> 01:50:08.630]  It looks like the beginning of the end of the dollar.
[01:50:08.630 --> 01:50:19.918]  I really hope gold goes down and this all stops, because I know what this means, but this is really bad news, but it's good news if you're in gold, and so it's kind of the best of times and the worst of times.
[01:50:19.918 --> 01:50:21.139]  Here's the toll-free number.
[01:50:21.139 --> 01:50:22.520]  The brokers are there.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:23.141]  No pressure.
[01:50:23.141 --> 01:50:24.822]  You just tell them it's the Alex Jones special.
[01:50:24.822 --> 01:50:25.543]  You get it.
[01:50:25.543 --> 01:50:26.083]  You get out.
[01:50:26.083 --> 01:50:28.385]  They got high-quality silver, high-quality gold.
[01:50:28.385 --> 01:50:29.466]  You can't beat these deals. 800.
[01:50:32.648 --> 01:50:33.108]  686-2237.
[01:50:33.108 --> 01:50:36.469]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:36.469 --> 01:50:41.571]  They'll be there till midnight tonight.
[01:50:41.571 --> 01:50:41.811]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:41.811 --> 01:50:44.392]  Ted can hold this deal till midnight.
[01:50:44.392 --> 01:50:50.054]  If you get your orders in, even if it's late night, or even if you leave a message, they can get back with you tomorrow.
[01:50:50.054 --> 01:50:50.694]  Don't wait.
[01:50:50.694 --> 01:50:54.395]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:50:54.395 --> 01:50:54.735]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:54.735 --> 01:50:58.657]  I bet you were wishing you listened to me six years ago when it was 300 an ounce.
[01:50:58.657 --> 01:50:59.237]  Don't wait.
[01:50:59.237 --> 01:50:59.817]  Get involved.
[01:51:12.728 --> 01:51:12.989]  I think so.

[01:52:03.002 --> 01:52:08.586]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.586 --> 01:52:13.610]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.610 --> 01:52:18.634]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that it could even happen again.

[01:54:19.233 --> 01:54:20.373]  Tuning into the radio today.
[01:54:20.373 --> 01:54:21.614]  Stay with us.
[01:54:21.614 --> 01:54:28.798]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny in studio coming up in about 40 minutes.
[01:54:28.798 --> 01:54:32.681]  Army Major.
[01:54:32.681 --> 01:54:34.922]  Witnesses say he is the shooter.
[01:54:39.537 --> 01:54:45.887]  What's really going on with Major Nidal Malik Hassan?
[01:54:45.887 --> 01:54:49.392]  Well, let's look at the circumstances.
[01:54:49.392 --> 01:54:52.456]  Let's look at what developed last Thursday at approximately 1.30 Central Time.
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:06.883]  Inside the largest military base in the world, Fort Hood, Texas, a giant, sprawling army base, six times the size of Dallas, geographically 340 square miles plus.
[01:55:06.883 --> 01:55:07.803]  That's just the main base.
[01:55:07.803 --> 01:55:12.025]  It has several auxiliary spurs.
[01:55:12.025 --> 01:55:24.629]  This individual reportedly, allegedly, kills 13 people and wounds 30 plus.
[01:55:26.991 --> 01:55:34.996]  They tell us for at least six hours that he was killed.
[01:55:34.996 --> 01:55:36.597]  Then they tell us he's alive.
[01:55:36.597 --> 01:55:37.738]  Then he's in a coma.
[01:55:37.738 --> 01:55:39.459]  Now he's speaking.
[01:55:39.459 --> 01:55:44.982]  They report for hour after hour and Governor Rick Perry reports that there were three shooters.
[01:55:44.982 --> 01:55:48.724]  Other people in custody.
[01:55:48.724 --> 01:55:52.807]  But that could just be fog of war.
[01:55:52.807 --> 01:55:55.849]  Then we learn that he is a psychiatrist.
[01:55:56.994 --> 01:55:58.355]  We learned that he's an Arab.
[01:55:58.355 --> 01:56:07.844]  And I said, on air, if it turns out to be an Arab, the mercury rises towards this being a staged event.
[01:56:07.844 --> 01:56:11.847]  I said, if he's been involved in the psychiatric system, it explodes.
[01:56:11.847 --> 01:56:17.772]  They just executed Mr. Mohammed last night, and without going over the entire Beltway sniper,
[01:56:18.655 --> 01:56:19.576]  Story again.
[01:56:19.576 --> 01:56:20.997]  That was clearly staged.
[01:56:20.997 --> 01:56:26.101]  Witnesses saw white men, white vans, black men, Hispanic men, white vans.
[01:56:26.101 --> 01:56:32.447]  Witness after witness saw them shooting people from the open backs of white vans, not the vehicle he was caught in.
[01:56:34.454 --> 01:56:41.698]  It turns out he was in the army, involved in psychiatric operations, had emails connected to the National Security Council.
[01:56:41.698 --> 01:56:43.439]  I could go on and on with that subject.
[01:56:43.439 --> 01:56:44.780]  It's just like Columbine.
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:53.085]  The way the media jumped on it made a huge spectacle out of it when there have been a lot of other big mass shootings at bases the last few years from post-traumatic stress disorder.
[01:56:55.230 --> 01:57:13.306]  When I went on press TV Thursday night, just hours after it happened, I said it could be a Muslim extremist, it could be post-traumatic stress disorder, he could be mentally ill, he could have been on Prozac, most of the mass shooters have been on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, the drug insert admits it could cause psychotic breaks and violent outbursts.
[01:57:13.306 --> 01:57:13.967]  I didn't know.
[01:57:13.967 --> 01:57:17.029]  I just laid out the different scenarios.
[01:57:17.029 --> 01:57:17.590]  We didn't know.
[01:57:19.844 --> 01:57:24.347]  People now go get that video from press TV and say I did it yesterday.
[01:57:24.347 --> 01:57:30.611]  And say I'm saying it could be post-traumatic stress today, you know, days after we know that he was never in combat.
[01:57:30.611 --> 01:57:37.055]  Though I would imagine it was stressful for years interviewing people who had seen all that carnage.
[01:57:37.055 --> 01:57:39.956]  Then enters all the other evidence.
[01:57:39.956 --> 01:57:46.941]  Congressional request for information from CIA on Hassan refused under national security ABC News.
[01:57:48.593 --> 01:57:48.913]  U.S.
[01:57:48.913 --> 01:57:56.979]  intelligence agencies were aware months ago that Army Major Nidal Malik Hassan was attempting to make contact with people associated with Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:56.979 --> 01:57:59.241]  He was really making contact with the CIA and FBI.
[01:57:59.241 --> 01:58:01.663]  Who do you think Al-Qaeda is?
[01:58:01.663 --> 01:58:06.947]  Two American officials briefed on classified material in the case told ABC News.
[01:58:10.987 --> 01:58:19.329]  They knew specifically that this guy was making contact with Imams who were calling for mass murder and calling for troops on U.S.
[01:58:19.329 --> 01:58:24.630]  bases in and out of the homeland to carry out attacks.
[01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:27.011]  So they are now absolute accomplices.
[01:58:27.011 --> 01:58:34.932]  If I knew my neighbor was going to kill his wife a month before he did it, and I didn't call the police, I would certainly be an accomplice.
[01:58:34.932 --> 01:58:38.133]  Back in 70 seconds, I'll continue to get into the heart of the matter.
[01:58:41.714 --> 01:58:47.379]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:47.379 --> 01:58:51.082]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:51.082 --> 01:59:00.250]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:59:00.250 --> 01:59:03.612]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:59:03.612 --> 01:59:09.257]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[01:59:09.457 --> 01:59:14.241]  Using NASA science, oxysilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:59:14.241 --> 01:59:25.949]  Oxysilver safely electrocutes pathogens, oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:59:26.049 --> 01:59:31.612]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[01:59:54.289 --> 01:59:56.690]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.690 --> 02:00:05.894]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.894 --> 02:00:07.194]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.194 --> 02:00:08.975]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.975 --> 02:00:10.735]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.735 --> 02:00:12.296]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.296 --> 02:00:13.236]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.236 --> 02:00:18.058]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.058 --> 02:00:22.100]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.772 --> 02:00:24.873]  We are back live.
[02:00:24.873 --> 02:00:26.515]  Now we've passed the waypoint.
[02:00:26.515 --> 02:00:28.136]  Halfway there.
[02:00:28.136 --> 02:00:32.741]  Two more hours straight ahead of key information.
[02:00:32.741 --> 02:00:41.729]  Continuing with Major Nidal Malik Hassan and the massacre at Fort Hood.
[02:00:41.729 --> 02:00:43.651]  So we have all these conflicting stories.
[02:00:43.651 --> 02:00:48.716]  It comes out that officials were aware of Hassan's efforts to contact and make contact with Al Qaeda.
[02:00:50.649 --> 02:00:55.270]  Now they're saying he's linked to the September 11th terrorist.
[02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:56.550]  Funny, they were all trained at U.S.
[02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.891]  bases.
[02:00:56.891 --> 02:01:00.992]  That's been in the Associated Press, but they go, oh, we don't know why they were trained in spy training at U.S.
[02:01:00.992 --> 02:01:02.092]  bases.
[02:01:02.092 --> 02:01:03.212]  Mohammed Adda, all of them.
[02:01:03.212 --> 02:01:04.793]  See, we forget about all of this.
[02:01:04.793 --> 02:01:10.074]  These are facts you can't ignore.
[02:01:10.074 --> 02:01:14.275]  And then we go back to the fact that the L.A.
[02:01:14.275 --> 02:01:18.696]  Times and other major newspapers reported at the time that the Unabomber was caught
[02:01:21.926 --> 02:01:31.950]  That Theodore Kaczynski had volunteered for MKUltra's CIA mind control program while attending an Ivy League school, getting his PhD.
[02:01:31.950 --> 02:01:33.230]  That is on record.
[02:01:33.230 --> 02:01:39.133]  Alexander Cockburn, Los Angeles Times and other publications, on record.
[02:01:39.133 --> 02:01:47.496]  Tim McVeigh taken into black ops, caught by the state police drooling on the side of the road saying, I've got a chip in me, help me, help me.
[02:01:47.496 --> 02:01:49.777]  Whether it was a psychological trigger term, we don't know.
[02:01:51.601 --> 02:02:04.806]  Then his head doctor, from the time he's arrested to the time he's executed at Terre Haute, Indiana, right through the Denver trial to his execution, Dr. Jolion West, was the head MKUltra doctor, along with Dr. Ewing Cameron.
[02:02:04.806 --> 02:02:05.786]  This is on record.
[02:02:05.786 --> 02:02:14.269]  The head MKUltra doctor, one of the fathers of MKUltra Mind Control, is his doctor until the day he's executed.
[02:02:14.269 --> 02:02:17.070]  Spending days with him every week.
[02:02:17.070 --> 02:02:19.751]  When he did TV interviews, clearly drugged out of his gourd.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:22.521]  I mean, how do you ignore this?
[02:02:22.521 --> 02:02:23.881]  These are facts.
[02:02:23.881 --> 02:02:25.822]  These are not conspiracy theories.
[02:02:25.822 --> 02:02:27.522]  This is not conjecture.
[02:02:27.522 --> 02:02:30.123]  This is not our opinion.
[02:02:30.123 --> 02:02:43.587]  Then we look at the supposed Fort Hood shooter, and he may be the shooter, Nidal Malik Hassan, an army psychiatrist.
[02:02:43.587 --> 02:02:44.607]  That's where they grab you.
[02:02:44.607 --> 02:02:45.507]  That's where they get you.
[02:02:45.507 --> 02:02:46.428]  That's where they drug you.
[02:02:46.428 --> 02:02:47.488]  That's where they program you.
[02:02:52.250 --> 02:03:01.914]  So either way you slice it, the CIA and FBI knew he was contacting Al Qaeda fronts that they run, and they let him do it.
[02:03:01.914 --> 02:03:04.296]  That's bare minimum.
[02:03:04.296 --> 02:03:15.941]  Then on every point and every issue, the media hype, the way they were ready day one, the way it was pushed, the way it was tied to September 11th, the way they're connecting into 9-11 truthers now.
[02:03:15.941 --> 02:03:20.143]  They have a known CIA operative, editor of the Washington Times, come out with a hit piece.
[02:03:21.545 --> 02:03:29.508]  Right as Obama's announcing a 40,000 troop increase, oh, it makes us feel sorry for the military and makes it sound like it's good for the military to expand these wars when it's not.
[02:03:29.508 --> 02:03:35.230]  And it's not good for our budget, it's not good for anything, except for opium dealers.
[02:03:35.230 --> 02:03:40.652]  And the 500 billion a year coming out of that country they can leverage to five trill.
[02:03:40.652 --> 02:03:48.235]  It comes out right after the FBI's caught cooking bombs, training drivers, finding mentally ill, unstable people to agree to drive the trucks to bomb buildings,
[02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:51.932]  In Illinois and other parts of the US.
[02:03:51.932 --> 02:03:54.455]  Comes out later, those were staged and provocateured.
[02:03:54.455 --> 02:03:58.541]  So you have real terrorists, you have provocateured terrorists, and you have totally staged events.
[02:03:58.541 --> 02:04:04.771]  We don't know what this event really was, but the secrecy surrounding it, all the conflicting stories,
[02:04:05.251 --> 02:04:10.034]  Now they're saying it doesn't look like this female cop was really the main person that took this guy down, but she was involved.
[02:04:10.034 --> 02:04:11.034]  She is a hero.
[02:04:11.034 --> 02:04:12.475]  But it was a male cop.
[02:04:12.475 --> 02:04:17.118]  Just like with Jessica Lynch, they lied and said she took on the Iraqis when it was somebody else.
[02:04:17.118 --> 02:04:20.020]  When people in her unit spoke out, they all got double-tapped in the head.
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:22.221]  Four people killed in one month.
[02:04:22.221 --> 02:04:24.102]  Back in the U.S.
[02:04:24.102 --> 02:04:25.923]  Turned out that was all a hoax.
[02:04:25.923 --> 02:04:28.645]  She had to go public and say it was a hoax, and the Army told her to lie.
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:31.281]  Pat Tillman was killed.
[02:04:31.281 --> 02:04:38.664]  It's come out they killed him because he was writing letters back, planning to go public about opium dealing and the war being a fraud.
[02:04:38.664 --> 02:04:45.367]  They can't have their poster boys go sideways on them.
[02:04:45.367 --> 02:04:46.827]  This thing stinks to high heaven.
[02:04:46.827 --> 02:04:49.869]  We'll talk more about it later, but I want to get into some other issues.
[02:04:54.928 --> 02:05:04.555]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.555 --> 02:05:08.178]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:08.178 --> 02:05:12.762]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.762 --> 02:05:14.163]  These emergency backup systems
[02:05:14.403 --> 02:05:17.285]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:05:17.285 --> 02:05:23.410]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:23.410 --> 02:05:27.032]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:27.032 --> 02:05:31.856]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.856 --> 02:05:38.420]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:40.362]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.842 --> 02:05:44.046]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:44.046 --> 02:05:48.550]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:50.773]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.773 --> 02:05:51.053]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:51.053 --> 02:05:51.774]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:01.786 --> 02:06:04.809]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.809 --> 02:06:10.134]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:10.134 --> 02:06:12.176]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:12.176 --> 02:06:17.181]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:17.181 --> 02:06:18.102]  How much do you want?
[02:06:18.342 --> 02:06:19.483]  When do you want it?
[02:06:19.483 --> 02:06:21.364]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:21.364 --> 02:06:22.424]  When will you need it?
[02:06:22.424 --> 02:06:24.645]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.645 --> 02:06:25.986]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.986 --> 02:06:27.507]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.507 --> 02:06:32.770]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.770 --> 02:06:36.352]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:36.352 --> 02:06:39.834]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:40.174 --> 02:06:41.395]  How much will you need?
[02:06:41.395 --> 02:06:42.296]  We don't know.
[02:06:42.296 --> 02:06:43.417]  How much do you want?
[02:06:43.417 --> 02:06:44.338]  All you can get.
[02:06:44.338 --> 02:06:45.439]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.439 --> 02:06:48.482]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:48.482 --> 02:06:50.264]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:50.264 --> 02:06:51.184]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.819 --> 02:07:06.126]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:06.126 --> 02:07:10.652]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.652 --> 02:07:12.935]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.935 --> 02:07:14.557]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:14.557 --> 02:07:15.599]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.819 --> 02:07:24.244]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:07:24.244 --> 02:07:31.708]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:07:31.708 --> 02:07:37.351]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[02:07:37.671 --> 02:07:38.231]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.751 --> 02:08:09.514]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.514 --> 02:08:11.276]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:11.276 --> 02:08:12.858]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.858 --> 02:08:14.420]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:18.606]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.606 --> 02:08:22.672]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:29.130 --> 02:08:34.355]  We are now simulcasting the syndicated radio broadcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:34.355 --> 02:08:49.651]  Dr. Sherry Timpenny is coming up later in the hour, into the next hour, to break down what's happening with the flu inoculations and fresh off two debates she's had here in Austin, visiting with us from her home state of Pennsylvania.
[02:08:50.712 --> 02:08:53.953]  Coming up, I'm going to be playing a video clip.
[02:08:53.953 --> 02:09:00.076]  Fox admits to planting political brainwashing in popular TV shows.
[02:09:00.076 --> 02:09:05.918]  This is an article written by Paul Watson back in March of this year, 2009.
[02:09:05.918 --> 02:09:17.143]  News Corp put out a video where they brag that they're pushing global warming propaganda.
[02:09:18.832 --> 02:09:27.301]  Separately though, in a few of News Corp's holdings, they are always claiming they're anti-man-made global warming and believe it's a hoax.
[02:09:27.301 --> 02:09:37.251]  But then at key points, these neocon publications come out and announce to everyone that
[02:09:40.273 --> 02:09:43.854]  Don't worry, the legislation isn't going to pass.
[02:09:43.854 --> 02:09:49.957]  They told us that the healthcare legislation, the government takeover of Obamacare wasn't going to pass the House, it passed.
[02:09:49.957 --> 02:09:55.999]  They told us don't worry, cap and trade, tax every facet of your life, federal control, no judicial review.
[02:09:57.489 --> 02:10:01.911]  Taxes on all energy, taxes on meat, taxes on farms.
[02:10:01.911 --> 02:10:03.591]  Don't worry, that's not going to pass the House.
[02:10:03.591 --> 02:10:04.712]  It passed.
[02:10:04.712 --> 02:10:17.996]  And I've seen a bunch of articles put out by the New York Post that Rupert Murdoch owns, Fox News, you name it, British newspapers he owns, Australian papers he owns, saying, don't worry, it's not going to pass.
[02:10:17.996 --> 02:10:21.758]  And in foreign papers, he's pushing that it's real and that we need it.
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.683]  But to get us to stand down and not think that there's a threat, he's telling us it's not going to pass.
[02:10:26.683 --> 02:10:37.931]  Well, the problem with that is Harry Reid, the head of the Senate, has put a health care bill on Senate calendar.
[02:10:37.931 --> 02:10:44.075]  He's filed the motion to introduce the bill on Monday, November 16th.
[02:10:44.075 --> 02:10:48.038]  Anticipating a Republican objection, the bill will be pushed onto the Senate calendar.
[02:10:48.038 --> 02:10:48.799]  Forced by him.
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:58.902]  And so they are going to attempt to pass this the 17th, 18th, and 19th of this month.
[02:10:58.902 --> 02:11:05.245]  We are only talking about six days away that they are going to launch this out of committee.
[02:11:05.245 --> 02:11:10.167]  And they're also talking about simultaneously in a week or two weeks trying to pass.
[02:11:10.167 --> 02:11:11.247]  It's already passed the House.
[02:11:11.247 --> 02:11:12.608]  All this has passed the House.
[02:11:12.608 --> 02:11:13.608]  It passes the Senate.
[02:11:16.607 --> 02:11:18.748]  If it passes the Senate, it's done.
[02:11:18.748 --> 02:11:24.011]  And the neocons are saying all over radio, all over TV, don't worry, we've won.
[02:11:24.011 --> 02:11:25.752]  And they're telling everybody to stand down.
[02:11:25.752 --> 02:11:35.216]  A month ago, Schwarzenegger came out and said, I'm not going to sign the bill in California, making you thumbprint and register to buy ammo.
[02:11:35.216 --> 02:11:38.578]  And I told everybody, I said, he's anti-gun, he's going to sign the bill next week.
[02:11:38.578 --> 02:11:39.578]  He signed it.
[02:11:39.578 --> 02:11:44.561]  He didn't want opposition, and he knows that people are barely paying attention to media, so they hear that
[02:11:46.337 --> 02:11:49.178]  Oh, Schwarzenegger said he wasn't for that, but then he signs it.
[02:11:49.178 --> 02:11:50.698]  They're manipulating you.
[02:11:50.698 --> 02:11:53.239]  They're going off the same playbook.
[02:11:53.239 --> 02:11:58.100]  There is a very good chance that all of this is going to pass.
[02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:11.263]  And somehow we've got to get the word out grassroots to call the Senate, to call all the senators that are on the fence about this, to call the couple of Democrats that are on the fence, and some of the Republicans that are on the fence, because they will have a narrow victory.
[02:12:11.997 --> 02:12:12.358]  Right now.
[02:12:30.993 --> 02:12:32.414]  We can beat this.
[02:12:32.414 --> 02:12:34.176]  And ladies and gentlemen, this is so important.
[02:12:34.176 --> 02:12:36.317]  This is economic warfare against our country.
[02:12:36.317 --> 02:12:38.299]  We have got to beat this.
[02:12:38.299 --> 02:12:41.422]  And here is a clip put out by Fox themselves.
[02:12:41.422 --> 02:12:51.570]  There's a bunch of other clips that people put together showing what they're doing from Fox TV, Fox movies, where Rupert Murdoch is bragging that he's trying to manipulate the news.
[02:12:51.570 --> 02:12:54.513]  He said last year at Davos, he's trying to manipulate people.
[02:12:54.513 --> 02:12:55.914]  So all of his holdings
[02:12:57.130 --> 02:13:00.934]  The TV, the movies are pushing it's good.
[02:13:00.934 --> 02:13:05.197]  Except for Fox News, they're saying it's bad, but don't worry, we beat it.
[02:13:05.197 --> 02:13:09.461]  This is why having a Judas goat in amongst us is so important at key times.
[02:13:09.461 --> 02:13:18.730]  Rupert Murdoch has spent tens of millions of his own money pushing this global carbon tax that will give an elite group of bankers total control over our economy.
[02:13:18.730 --> 02:13:19.791]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[02:13:22.964 --> 02:13:32.589]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no matter what the size of your carbon footprint is, you can make a difference.
[02:13:32.589 --> 02:13:34.610]  How's April on record?
[02:13:34.610 --> 02:13:35.670]  Global warming.
[02:13:35.670 --> 02:13:36.511]  Probably.
[02:13:36.511 --> 02:13:42.794]  Press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years.
[02:13:42.794 --> 02:13:45.475]  Three years is a long ways away.
[02:13:45.475 --> 02:13:50.477]  What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference?
[02:13:50.477 --> 02:13:51.358]  Just had another thought.
[02:13:52.651 --> 02:13:57.072]  What if the Scared Straight Show had a green message to the biggest thing we've done?
[02:13:57.072 --> 02:13:57.552]  You know what?
[02:13:57.552 --> 02:14:00.193]  Stop it.
[02:14:00.193 --> 02:14:01.213]  Back up to the start.
[02:14:01.213 --> 02:14:04.014]  You know, I meant to play this and not comment, but I have to.
[02:14:04.014 --> 02:14:05.834]  This was put out in 2006.
[02:14:05.834 --> 02:14:07.675]  We wrote about it in March of this year.
[02:14:07.675 --> 02:14:09.695]  And they put out other promos.
[02:14:09.695 --> 02:14:12.176]  News Corp put this out.
[02:14:12.176 --> 02:14:13.096]  They want you to know
[02:14:14.537 --> 02:14:16.278]  And the NFL says it's real.
[02:14:16.278 --> 02:14:19.579]  All the big hype machines are telling you global warming's real.
[02:14:19.579 --> 02:14:26.322]  In 2006, they were saying the Earth will flood and New York, everyone will die, the Simpsons, in three years.
[02:14:26.322 --> 02:14:28.663]  See, they had it timed up to 2009.
[02:14:28.663 --> 02:14:29.523]  They meant to pass it.
[02:14:29.523 --> 02:14:31.284]  They've been saying this for many years.
[02:14:31.284 --> 02:14:34.105]  This is the year they want to ram it all through.
[02:14:34.105 --> 02:14:37.066]  So again, for radio listeners that are just listening, you can go to
[02:14:39.394 --> 02:14:43.955]  PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:14:43.955 --> 02:14:47.256]  And you can go to the story if you want to watch this video clip.
[02:14:47.256 --> 02:14:51.277]  Fox admits to planning political brainwashing in popular TV shows.
[02:14:51.277 --> 02:14:52.337]  Go there and watch it.
[02:14:52.337 --> 02:14:53.337]  It's even more powerful.
[02:14:53.337 --> 02:14:57.218]  But again, these are TV shows and media clips with implanted messages.
[02:14:57.218 --> 02:15:00.319]  Rupert Murdoch is bragging that he's brainwashing people.
[02:15:00.319 --> 02:15:05.540]  And we have clips of him as well separately at News Corp press conferences admitting this.
[02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:06.400]  But here it is.
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:08.141]  I'm not going to stop at this time.
[02:15:08.141 --> 02:15:08.821]  From the start,
[02:15:09.341 --> 02:15:16.285]  This is your champion, Fox News Corp, The Conservatives, stabbing you in the back.
[02:15:16.285 --> 02:15:16.745]  Here it is.
[02:15:16.745 --> 02:15:32.574]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no matter what the size of your carbon footprint is, you can make a difference.
[02:15:32.574 --> 02:15:33.975]  Out of state for long record.
[02:15:35.029 --> 02:15:36.070]  Global warming.
[02:15:36.070 --> 02:15:36.911]  Probably.
[02:15:36.911 --> 02:15:41.217]  Press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years.
[02:15:41.217 --> 02:15:45.882]  Three years is a long ways away.
[02:15:45.882 --> 02:15:50.889]  What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference?
[02:15:50.889 --> 02:15:51.790]  Just had another thought.
[02:15:53.061 --> 02:15:56.442]  What if the Scared Straight Show had a green message to it?
[02:15:56.442 --> 02:16:04.586]  The biggest thing we've done is inserting messages about the environment into some of our content.
[02:16:04.586 --> 02:16:05.926]  I don't follow.
[02:16:05.926 --> 02:16:06.486]  Green!
[02:16:06.486 --> 02:16:08.167]  It means environmentally friendly.
[02:16:08.407 --> 02:16:15.730]  The lifeblood of our company is the quality of our TV shows and we would accomplish nothing if we compromise that quality.
[02:16:15.730 --> 02:16:19.252]  Going green doesn't fit with the rest of the show.
[02:16:19.252 --> 02:16:20.792]  We're working magic, make it fit.
[02:16:20.792 --> 02:16:24.614]  Hey Brian, I'm not going to recycle this aluminum can, I'm just going to throw it in the trash.
[02:16:27.267 --> 02:16:28.808]  You're Earth's bitch!
[02:16:28.808 --> 02:16:50.328]  The most powerful way that we could communicate the commitment on behalf of our company was to change the practices within the production as well as work in a message about global warming, about environmental changes, and about empowering people to take responsibility.
[02:16:50.328 --> 02:16:52.310]  Why are your wedding programs bumpy?
[02:16:54.284 --> 02:16:57.306]  We've come up with all sorts of strategies for lessening our footprint.
[02:16:57.306 --> 02:16:59.907]  Everything from utilizing hybrid vehicles on our production.
[02:16:59.907 --> 02:17:01.228]  Look at all these Hummers.
[02:17:01.228 --> 02:17:03.049]  What kind of jerk would drive one of those?
[02:17:24.042 --> 02:17:26.724]  Dude, this car kicks ass!
[02:17:26.724 --> 02:17:29.866]  Yeah, Rumsfeld!
[02:17:29.866 --> 02:17:34.790]  We're using biodiesel fuel in our generators instead of regular diesel.
[02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:36.691]  No car, no electricity.
[02:17:36.691 --> 02:17:39.113]  Car funny?
[02:17:39.113 --> 02:17:40.694]  I got a zero carbon footprint.
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:45.502]  We're now frequently getting scripts electronically.
[02:17:45.502 --> 02:17:47.823]  Fluorescent bulbs that use less electricity.
[02:17:47.823 --> 02:17:50.004]  Reusable hemp bags for shopping.
[02:17:50.004 --> 02:17:52.245]  Shampoo that's not tested on animals.
[02:17:52.245 --> 02:17:57.107]  I feel bad for those lab animals running around with dirty hair, but better for the environment.
[02:17:57.107 --> 02:17:58.528]  That's a sacrifice they have to make.
[02:17:59.414 --> 02:18:03.735]  Here at 24, we are committed to reducing our impact on climate change.
[02:18:03.735 --> 02:18:06.756]  And we know that we can't solve this problem in 24 hours.
[02:18:06.756 --> 02:18:11.957]  But by making energy-conscious decisions on our set, we are contributing to a solution.
[02:18:11.957 --> 02:18:21.040]  Galvanizing that kind of an effort with as many people as it has taken to get on board and sort of help us with this effort, it hasn't been difficult.
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:26.341]  On the contrary, it's been rewarding and people have acted swiftly and enthusiastically.
[02:18:26.966 --> 02:18:28.567]  He's powering the blender.
[02:18:28.567 --> 02:18:30.747]  The wheel rim is attached to a generator.
[02:18:30.747 --> 02:18:32.168]  This is rather ingenious.
[02:18:32.168 --> 02:18:33.848]  Stay fit and save energy.
[02:18:33.848 --> 02:18:36.369]  If everyone should do it, I'm sure it'll catch on.
[02:18:36.369 --> 02:18:42.931]  Mr. McKay says that history is past, but saving the Earth is our present to the future.
[02:18:44.291 --> 02:18:53.213]  The fact that this company decided to get behind the move to try to bring an end to global warming was really gratifying.
[02:18:53.213 --> 02:18:57.994]  Finally, I get to save the Earth with deadly lasers instead of deadly slideshows.
[02:18:57.994 --> 02:18:59.275]  Aww, isn't that sweet?
[02:19:05.819 --> 02:19:16.004]  Now, every other major corporation is all behind this because they're owned by the private central banks that you will openly pay taxes on thousands of products directly to them.
[02:19:16.004 --> 02:19:21.686]  But more importantly, unelected boards will be able to shut down any businesses, any corporations.
[02:19:21.686 --> 02:19:23.927]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[02:19:23.927 --> 02:19:25.328]  We have the carbon tax bill.
[02:19:25.328 --> 02:19:26.649]  We have the carbon tax treaty.
[02:19:27.535 --> 02:19:35.400]  It gives unlimited dictatorial power to unelected private groups like the WTO, the IMF, the World Bank.
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:37.922]  Al Gore is your hero saving the earth.
[02:19:37.922 --> 02:19:41.384]  Already made a billion bucks off this and they're just getting started.
[02:19:41.384 --> 02:19:47.408]  That's why Rupert Murdoch has all his fake conservative publications telling you health care isn't going to pass.
[02:19:48.268 --> 02:19:50.831]  And telling you that cap-and-trade isn't going to pass.
[02:19:50.831 --> 02:19:52.573]  They told you it wouldn't pass the House.
[02:19:52.573 --> 02:19:53.594]  It's all passed.
[02:19:53.594 --> 02:19:55.717]  They told you it wouldn't go to the floor of the Senate.
[02:19:55.717 --> 02:19:58.700]  It's now all going to the floor of the Senate.
[02:19:58.700 --> 02:19:59.441]  This is close.
[02:20:01.789 --> 02:20:03.971]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:20:03.971 --> 02:20:04.831]  Spy on me?
[02:20:04.831 --> 02:20:05.151]  Yeah.
[02:20:05.151 --> 02:20:10.195]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:20:10.195 --> 02:20:11.816]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:20:11.816 --> 02:20:12.557]  Startpage?
[02:20:12.557 --> 02:20:12.977]  Yeah.
[02:20:12.977 --> 02:20:14.078]  Startpage.com.
[02:20:14.078 --> 02:20:17.040]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:20.923]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:20:20.923 --> 02:20:23.725]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:20:24.065 --> 02:20:26.686]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:20:26.686 --> 02:20:28.246]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:20:28.246 --> 02:20:28.546]  Right!

[02:21:01.832 --> 02:21:04.795]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:21:06.408 --> 02:21:06.809]  I think so.
[02:21:21.448 --> 02:21:21.868]  I think so.
[02:21:51.568 --> 02:21:54.150]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:54.950]  Or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.

[02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:55.971]  Good day.
[02:21:55.971 --> 02:21:57.351]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:21:57.351 --> 02:21:57.732]  November 11, 2009.
[02:21:57.732 --> 02:21:58.732]  Gold opened this morning at $11,1680.
[02:21:58.732 --> 02:22:02.995]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11,4730, $5,7365 for a half-ounce, or $2,8682 for a quarter-ounce.
[02:22:02.995 --> 02:22:03.315]  That's $11,4730, $5,7365, or $2,8682.
[02:22:21.678 --> 02:22:35.287]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[02:22:35.287 --> 02:22:36.528]  Is this capitalism?
[02:22:36.528 --> 02:22:44.113]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:44.113 --> 02:22:45.234]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:45.234 --> 02:22:49.357]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[02:22:49.577 --> 02:22:53.539]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.539 --> 02:22:55.480]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:58.722]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:58.722 --> 02:23:01.723]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.723 --> 02:23:02.944]  The once mighty U.S.
[02:23:02.944 --> 02:23:05.965]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[02:23:05.965 --> 02:23:08.626]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[02:23:08.626 --> 02:23:11.808]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[02:23:11.808 --> 02:23:15.550]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:24.192]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders, and Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[02:23:24.192 --> 02:23:25.433]  Prepare now!
[02:23:25.433 --> 02:23:30.374]  Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[02:23:30.374 --> 02:23:35.476]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish, with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:23:35.876 --> 02:23:40.658]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you're buying Factory Direct at wholesale prices.
[02:23:40.658 --> 02:23:42.858]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:23:42.858 --> 02:23:46.300]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you free of charge.
[02:23:46.300 --> 02:23:46.600]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:46.680]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:48.100]  Or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:48.601]  Factory Direct.
[02:23:48.601 --> 02:23:50.521]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[02:23:50.521 --> 02:23:50.961]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[02:24:09.090 --> 02:24:24.936]  We've got a surprise guest with us in this segment, maybe a little bit in the next, because Sherry Tenpenny is set to arrive in the next 10-15 minutes, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, here in Austin, fighting the folks trying to have forced flu vaccinations.
[02:24:24.936 --> 02:24:29.237]  Medical doctor Sherry Tenpenny coming up later in this hour and into the next hour.
[02:24:29.237 --> 02:24:36.200]  I just played clips of Fox News, Fox TV, bragging that they're trying to brainwash people for the global carbon tax.
[02:24:37.210 --> 02:24:42.712]  And George Humphrey, who's in my film Fall of the Republic, I just saw his car drive up.
[02:24:42.712 --> 02:24:46.634]  He lives here in Austin, former city councilman, economist, good friend of mine.
[02:24:46.634 --> 02:24:48.835]  He's in Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic.
[02:24:48.835 --> 02:24:50.356]  He pulled up right as we were going live.
[02:24:50.356 --> 02:24:52.837]  I said, why not sit him down for a segment or two?
[02:24:52.837 --> 02:24:55.878]  And I said, what do you think of Fall of the Republic?
[02:24:55.878 --> 02:25:00.180]  And George Humphrey, who's in the film, give us your take on this, and I want your truthful take.
[02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:02.221]  What do you think of this film compared to the Obama Deception?
[02:25:02.461 --> 02:25:08.922]  Well, it's hard for me to be totally objective because I'm in it, but I think it's the best thing you've ever done.
[02:25:08.922 --> 02:25:12.663]  The Obama deception was awesome.
[02:25:12.663 --> 02:25:16.084]  I think you've had over six or seven million hits on it.
[02:25:16.084 --> 02:25:18.264]  I think this is going to be even bigger.
[02:25:18.264 --> 02:25:19.024]  It's cleaner.
[02:25:19.024 --> 02:25:21.505]  The production values are better.
[02:25:21.505 --> 02:25:23.265]  It's right up to date.
[02:25:23.265 --> 02:25:26.066]  And Alex, I am so honored.
[02:25:27.239 --> 02:25:34.444]  I am so honored to be your friend, because I consider you one of the top patriots this nation has ever had.
[02:25:34.444 --> 02:25:35.685]  I truly... Well, you're a sweetheart.
[02:25:35.685 --> 02:25:36.965]  I consider you a top patriot.
[02:25:36.965 --> 02:25:47.652]  Well, thank you very much, and I accept that wholeheartedly, and we're going to continue to do it, because this country, this country is far, far too good to kick it away.
[02:25:47.652 --> 02:25:51.275]  And right now, if we, the people who are listening to this right now,
[02:25:51.855 --> 02:26:15.543]  If we don't get activated, if we don't help stop this sick care program, if we don't stop this carbon tax, if we don't stop the lies, if we don't stop the increased selling of our jobs to foreign countries, the destruction of our dollar, the bailouts, all of this stuff, it is all preconceived to destroy this wonderful, beautiful republic.
[02:26:15.643 --> 02:26:17.224]  And now there's no longer any doubt.
[02:26:17.224 --> 02:26:21.468]  They openly are announcing everywhere, the end of America, total carbon tax.
[02:26:21.468 --> 02:26:26.372]  They're saying, we won't turn the liquidity back on the banks, who we gave this fiat power to.
[02:26:26.372 --> 02:26:28.574]  It's a bunch of Madoffs and Ken Lay types.
[02:26:29.585 --> 02:26:31.505]  In fact, they came up with the plan themselves.
[02:26:31.505 --> 02:26:33.946]  If we don't go along with this, they're going to kill the economy.
[02:26:33.946 --> 02:26:35.286]  They're already killing the economy.
[02:26:35.286 --> 02:26:36.606]  They want zero growth.
[02:26:36.606 --> 02:26:37.787]  They want negative growth.
[02:26:37.787 --> 02:26:39.067]  They want a monopoly.
[02:26:39.067 --> 02:26:42.408]  What is this cap-and-trade and government takeover of healthcare really about, George?
[02:26:42.408 --> 02:26:44.208]  Well, it's all about a transfer of power.
[02:26:44.208 --> 02:26:48.709]  It has nothing to do with taking care of the people of this country.
[02:26:48.709 --> 02:26:51.270]  It has nothing to do with honesty.
[02:26:51.270 --> 02:26:52.890]  It has nothing to do with health.
[02:26:53.630 --> 02:27:02.318]  It is 17% of the economy is going to be transferred to the control of the federal government.
[02:27:02.318 --> 02:27:03.899]  It is sick care.
[02:27:03.899 --> 02:27:06.722]  It is completely status quo.
[02:27:06.722 --> 02:27:15.910]  It is absolutely selling out to Big Pharma, the hospital corporations, segments of the AMA and the insurance companies.
[02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:20.772]  And here is the Framework Convention on Climate Change openly admitted that it's world government.
[02:27:20.772 --> 02:27:26.875]  And then Ban Ki-moon writes an editorial, the UN Secretary General, saying global government, global carbon tax.
[02:27:26.875 --> 02:27:36.159]  And then I notice there must be paid trolls all over my site, all over YouTube, under other names, cutting and pasting that I'm a liar, that Ban Ki-moon didn't write an article.
[02:27:36.659 --> 02:27:45.871]  I mean, they're using flat-out lies against us and I'm now on the White House enemies list and George Soros has opened fire on me every day in his publications.
[02:27:45.871 --> 02:27:46.531]  What does that say?
[02:27:46.531 --> 02:27:47.413]  It means we can beat him.
[02:27:47.972 --> 02:27:49.213]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:27:49.213 --> 02:27:57.302]  You know, the thing about it is, the truth moves very, very slowly, and lies and innuendo and hate move very quickly.
[02:27:57.302 --> 02:28:01.667]  And the lies and innuendo are moving like mad dogs right now.
[02:28:01.667 --> 02:28:07.593]  And even though you speak with a very harsh voice at times, is that you speak the truth.
[02:28:08.234 --> 02:28:09.696]  And the truth is coming out.
[02:28:09.696 --> 02:28:16.107]  And remember 17, 18 years ago when we were talking about this, when we were a handful of about 15 people.
[02:28:16.107 --> 02:28:19.271]  Yeah, I knew you before I even went on local TV.
[02:28:19.271 --> 02:28:21.635]  When I was running around trying to get Pat Buchanan elected.
[02:28:22.375 --> 02:28:27.737]  And we were down, 17, 18 years ago, we were down and we would say, the New World Order.
[02:28:27.737 --> 02:28:40.921]  And people would get, and now, wherever I go, I was just buying some flowers at a local place here, and several people, not one or two, but several people came up and said, aren't you George Humphrey, and weren't you in the fall of the Republic?
[02:28:40.921 --> 02:28:41.761]  And I went, wow.
[02:28:42.361 --> 02:28:43.563]  Yeah, thanks.
[02:28:43.563 --> 02:28:44.063]  That's cool.
[02:28:44.063 --> 02:28:46.506]  So it's been out two weeks and you're already running into people on the street.
[02:28:46.506 --> 02:28:56.999]  Yeah, and these are people I didn't know, and clearly Austin is the center of the positive revolution, the return of... Isn't that crazy?
[02:28:56.999 --> 02:28:59.502]  Because all over the world, mainstream media says we are the center.
[02:29:00.083 --> 02:29:01.103]  Other resistance!
[02:29:01.103 --> 02:29:17.027]  People are moving here in all different forms, whether it's for politics or economics, but there are more and more people who are coming here for their spiritual upliftment too, because as you and I both know, this is not just an economic or a political or a cultural battle.
[02:29:17.027 --> 02:29:19.088]  It is a time of spiritual choice.
[02:29:19.628 --> 02:29:22.169]  And each and every one of us has to make a decision.
[02:29:22.169 --> 02:29:41.636]  Are we going to hold on to the old paradigm of separation consciousness and fear and domination, which is going to take us to total chaos, or are we going to change our lives to unity consciousness, more love, cooperation, working with others, but also self-sufficiency and bravery and a stiff backbone.
[02:29:41.636 --> 02:29:43.017]  That's the new paradigm.
[02:29:43.297 --> 02:29:43.978]  We got a break.
[02:29:43.978 --> 02:29:46.141]  I want to come back and talk about the globalist agenda.
[02:29:46.141 --> 02:29:48.023]  They're moving on every front right now.
[02:29:48.023 --> 02:29:49.465]  They're trying to sew things up.
[02:29:49.465 --> 02:29:52.149]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:52.149 --> 02:29:53.551]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.551 --> 02:29:56.094]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.094 --> 02:29:58.778]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:05.463]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:30:05.463 --> 02:30:08.346]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:30:08.346 --> 02:30:09.607]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[02:30:10.427 --> 02:30:12.669]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.

[02:31:01.061 --> 02:31:05.622]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.622 --> 02:31:06.522]  Number 1.
[02:31:06.522 --> 02:31:09.963]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.963 --> 02:31:10.823]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.823 --> 02:31:15.705]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.705 --> 02:31:16.445]  It's true.
[02:31:16.445 --> 02:31:21.326]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.326 --> 02:31:22.146]  Number 3.
[02:31:22.146 --> 02:31:25.727]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.727 --> 02:31:29.428]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.648 --> 02:31:30.429]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.429 --> 02:31:33.191]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:33.191 --> 02:31:36.873]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.873 --> 02:31:37.674]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.674 --> 02:31:41.817]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.817 --> 02:31:46.580]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:35.840]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:32:35.840 --> 02:32:37.601]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:32:37.601 --> 02:32:40.121]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:32:40.121 --> 02:32:44.842]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:32:44.842 --> 02:32:48.563]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.

[02:33:07.253 --> 02:33:13.037]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, the 11th day of November on this Wednesday edition 2009.
[02:33:13.037 --> 02:33:20.782]  George Humphrey, economist, former Austin City Council member, documentary filmmaker, best-selling author, is in studio with us for another five minutes.
[02:33:20.782 --> 02:33:22.563]  I'm going to play a few minute clip
[02:33:23.123 --> 02:33:33.512]  From the intro to my interview with Governor Jesse Ventura as he gave us an exclusive look into his new TV show, Conspiracy Theory, that comes from our perspective to air on TruTV.
[02:33:33.512 --> 02:33:34.673]  I'm a consultant.
[02:33:34.673 --> 02:33:35.955]  I'm in some of the episodes.
[02:33:35.955 --> 02:33:38.817]  It's very, very exciting and it looks like it's going to be a good piece.
[02:33:38.817 --> 02:33:39.958]  It premieres December 2nd.
[02:33:40.979 --> 02:33:50.102]  We'll also have open phones for Dr. Sherry Tinpenny coming up, but five more minutes with George Humphrey since he happened to drop by before we go to that tape and then we're going to come back live with Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[02:33:50.102 --> 02:33:51.842]  You were going to finish up because you're an economist.
[02:33:51.842 --> 02:33:52.362]  Yeah.
[02:33:52.362 --> 02:33:53.803]  You're Info of the Republic.
[02:33:53.803 --> 02:33:57.204]  I should add, everybody needs to get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:57.204 --> 02:34:00.645]  You're authorized to make copies for not-for-sale purposes.
[02:34:00.645 --> 02:34:04.046]  I have to say that or people then take it and say it's their right to sell it and I can't sell it.
[02:34:04.346 --> 02:34:06.947]  We even had that happen on Amazon in places, and they get mad.
[02:34:06.947 --> 02:34:08.168]  We're only going to sell your stuff.
[02:34:08.168 --> 02:34:09.289]  You can't sell your own stuff.
[02:34:09.289 --> 02:34:11.810]  The point is, we also need your support.
[02:34:11.810 --> 02:34:17.293]  So again, InfoWars.com, the online video bookstore shopping cart, or call toll-free to get Fall of the Republic.
[02:34:17.293 --> 02:34:23.096]  You can get it in a combo pack with Reflections and Warnings, which is really good, with the late, great Aaron Russo.
[02:34:23.096 --> 02:34:26.398]  The last video interview he did, it's a documentary, incredible revelations.
[02:34:26.398 --> 02:34:29.660]  You can get that free while supplies last, because we're running out of them.
[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:31.721]  This printing of them I have.
[02:34:31.721 --> 02:34:34.482]  You can get it free with Fall of the Republic today.
[02:34:34.482 --> 02:34:40.724]  Look for that combo special at InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:34:40.724 --> 02:34:45.146]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:34:45.146 --> 02:34:46.126]  Going back to George Humphrey.
[02:34:46.126 --> 02:34:47.246]  George, you got five minutes.
[02:34:47.246 --> 02:34:48.267]  It was great to have you pop in.
[02:34:48.267 --> 02:34:50.688]  I want to have you as a guest the next few weeks now that you're back in Austin.
[02:34:50.688 --> 02:34:53.709]  You're always jet-setting around the globe, which is bad for your carbon footprint.
[02:34:53.709 --> 02:34:54.089]  They're saying
[02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:56.390]  Carbon credits, carbon rationing.
[02:34:56.390 --> 02:34:59.250]  You'll have to get government authorization to be able to fly.
[02:34:59.250 --> 02:35:00.511]  That's openly being announced.
[02:35:00.511 --> 02:35:03.132]  People are really waking up now because this is all happening.
[02:35:03.132 --> 02:35:05.872]  But, as an economist, I have the health care bill.
[02:35:05.872 --> 02:35:07.593]  I've read the subsections here.
[02:35:07.593 --> 02:35:11.334]  The close to 2,000, it's 1,960 something pages.
[02:35:11.334 --> 02:35:17.096]  It says five years in prison, quarter million dollar fine if you don't buy insurance.
[02:35:17.096 --> 02:35:20.237]  So forget just taking, and they take 2.5 to 5% depending on your pay grade.
[02:35:25.025 --> 02:35:27.326]  2.5 to 5% is taken out of your check.
[02:35:27.326 --> 02:35:33.109]  This is in the bill and for the uninsured and you're forced to buy insurance.
[02:35:33.109 --> 02:35:38.652]  So this is a massive new tax to the bankers as an economist who's predicted everything that's happening right now.
[02:35:38.652 --> 02:35:41.093]  A top economist and a successful businessman.
[02:35:41.093 --> 02:35:42.894]  What will this health care plan really do?
[02:35:43.174 --> 02:36:02.200]  Well, first of all, it hasn't passed the Senate, and I'm sure there's going to be huge changes, but as it stands now, Pelosi's bill, according to one of the top guys I talked to, he's neither Democrat or Republican, he says that for a family of four making $100,000, it's going to cost that family $20,000 a year as the bill stands right now.
[02:36:09.127 --> 02:36:10.628]  Now that's impossible.
[02:36:10.628 --> 02:36:25.801]  A family of four, even though $100,000 is a lot of money, a family of four, when they pay their mortgage, when they pay their car payments, when they pay their gas and electric and their phone and they send Johnny and Susie to school and they go to the Starbucks, they don't have anything left.
[02:36:25.801 --> 02:36:36.490]  As a matter of fact, starting about seven years ago, the first time in the history of America, the average family in the United States is now spending more and has more debt than they have assets.
[02:36:38.443 --> 02:36:42.468]  $20,000 as the bill stands right now.
[02:36:42.468 --> 02:36:48.414]  Now clearly, clearly, clearly the Senate's going to change this thing and it's going to get moved around.
[02:36:48.414 --> 02:36:54.621]  But the people of this country have to understand, this is a status quo sick care bill.
[02:36:55.442 --> 02:36:57.982]  It supports Big Pharma.
[02:36:57.982 --> 02:37:00.743]  It supports the hospital corporations.
[02:37:00.743 --> 02:37:05.264]  It supports segments of the AMA and of the insurance company.
[02:37:05.264 --> 02:37:06.804]  Does it support you and me?
[02:37:06.804 --> 02:37:07.744]  No.
[02:37:07.744 --> 02:37:09.964]  Now let me be clear here, just to add a point.
[02:37:09.964 --> 02:37:19.206]  Dennis Kucinich came out two weeks ago, wrote an editorial, gave a speech, and it was titled, Health Care Bill is a Bailout to Insurance Companies.
[02:37:19.206 --> 02:37:23.867]  And then he wrote another editorial Monday titled, Why I Voted Against the Bill.
[02:37:24.907 --> 02:37:29.068]  And he's a socialist, but I respect him because he'll speak out against government-sponsored terror.
[02:37:29.068 --> 02:37:30.268]  He's a good man.
[02:37:30.268 --> 02:37:36.230]  I disagree with his political system and his ideas on economics, but I really respect Dennis because he's the real deal.
[02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:37.010]  Yeah, I know.
[02:37:37.010 --> 02:37:38.550]  And he said, look, this isn't socialism.
[02:37:38.550 --> 02:37:40.190]  You know, when Newsweek says we're all socialists.
[02:37:40.190 --> 02:37:51.473]  Now, Bull, the insurance companies, in fact, I have the Wall Street Journal right here, the insurance companies, here is the spokesman for the insurance companies admitting in this article from the Wall Street Journal
[02:37:52.426 --> 02:37:54.427]  That they actually wrote the bill.
[02:37:54.427 --> 02:37:55.307]  They want penalties.
[02:37:55.307 --> 02:37:56.827]  They want to make you get this.
[02:37:56.827 --> 02:37:58.248]  It gives them liability protection.
[02:37:58.248 --> 02:38:01.168]  But they come out and act like they're actually against it.
[02:38:01.168 --> 02:38:04.109]  Just like News Corp is actually for the global greenhouse tax.
[02:38:04.109 --> 02:38:04.489]  Absolutely.
[02:38:04.489 --> 02:38:05.150]  Of course.
[02:38:05.150 --> 02:38:07.530]  So again, there's all sorts of baiting and switching here.
[02:38:07.530 --> 02:38:10.471]  And every time we say we're against this, oh, you're against cap and trade.
[02:38:10.471 --> 02:38:11.731]  You work for the oil companies.
[02:38:11.731 --> 02:38:13.272]  They're funding cap and trade.
[02:38:13.272 --> 02:38:14.612]  Oh, you're against the health care bill.
[02:38:14.612 --> 02:38:15.852]  You're working for the insurance companies.
[02:38:15.852 --> 02:38:17.413]  You know, I work for Alex Jones and that's it.
[02:38:17.873 --> 02:38:21.495]  You know, the fact is, is this is not about health.
[02:38:21.495 --> 02:38:24.416]  This is about a transfer of power.
[02:38:24.416 --> 02:38:38.483]  17% of the gross national product of the whole economy is going to be transferred from the private sector, which isn't working right now, but to the federal sector, which is going to be an absolute train wreck.
[02:38:38.483 --> 02:38:43.245]  This is about the grabbing of power, the taking of your rights.
[02:38:43.245 --> 02:38:44.926]  And friends, the only way it's going to stop
[02:38:45.586 --> 02:38:55.755]  is when the people who are listening to this get themselves fully educated, listen to Alex, watch Fall of the Republic, and then go talk to your friends, and then start beating the pans.
[02:38:55.755 --> 02:39:00.819]  It's time to stop being secret and whispering about this stuff.
[02:39:00.819 --> 02:39:04.583]  It's time to start talking about it everywhere you go.
[02:39:04.583 --> 02:39:10.248]  In the grocery stores, at the coffee houses, at your club, on your runs, at church.
[02:39:10.248 --> 02:39:12.590]  Everybody you know you need to speak to
[02:39:12.850 --> 02:39:15.477]  You're right, George, because they're making their move right now.
[02:39:15.477 --> 02:39:17.000]  I mean, go back to October.
[02:39:18.482 --> 02:39:20.343]  Here's an amazing statistic.
[02:39:20.343 --> 02:39:22.664]  In the last six months, in the last hundred working days,
[02:39:48.317 --> 02:39:58.501]  In the United States, Goldman Sachs, through the carry trade, has made over a hundred million dollars per day in the reverse carry trade.
[02:39:58.501 --> 02:40:00.402]  Just on manipulating dollars.
[02:40:00.402 --> 02:40:01.782]  And manipulating dollars.
[02:40:01.782 --> 02:40:04.483]  It used to be the Japanese carry trade here.
[02:40:04.483 --> 02:40:16.068]  What we've done now is reverse it, and the big guys, Goldman Sachs, mostly through investments in Brazil and some of the other countries, they are making a hundred million dollars a day.
[02:40:16.068 --> 02:40:16.988]  Off the death of the dollar.
[02:40:17.348 --> 02:40:18.789]  Off the death of the dollar.
[02:40:18.789 --> 02:40:24.495]  And they're saying the Arabs are killing the dollar, the Arabs, the Chinese, the Russians, they're all begging us not to do this.
[02:40:24.495 --> 02:40:25.916]  They hold all the dollars.
[02:40:25.916 --> 02:40:32.061]  But the media is killing the dollar, the banks are killing it, and then blaming it on the Iranians.
[02:40:32.061 --> 02:40:33.883]  No, the enemy is the Federal Reserve.
[02:40:33.883 --> 02:40:34.724]  They are the culprit.
[02:40:34.724 --> 02:40:36.685]  The enemy is inside the walls.
[02:40:37.785 --> 02:40:45.470]  And the folks who are running these, you know, all you have to do is read Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, or read The Economist.
[02:40:45.470 --> 02:40:46.811]  Wake up, friends!
[02:40:46.811 --> 02:40:59.900]  The people who are controlling Wall Street are the same people who control ABC, NBC, the total media, and they control both the Republican and Democratic parties and the controlled opposition.
[02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:05.644]  What we are facing is so much bigger than even 95% of educated patriots are aware of.
[02:41:07.805 --> 02:41:14.927]  Exactly, that's why people ask why I'm so upset and I'm so... Folks, if I caught somebody robbing my car in my yard, I'd get upset.
[02:41:14.927 --> 02:41:19.408]  This is a government organized tyranny taking over my life.
[02:41:19.408 --> 02:41:20.408]  These are bad people.
[02:41:20.408 --> 02:41:25.709]  They want to force eugenics and control and inoculations through a medical tyranny.
[02:41:25.709 --> 02:41:36.732]  Goldman Sachs, because they can borrow directly from the Treasury, is taking money at less than one half of one percent and then able to go out and buy the reserves
[02:41:37.172 --> 02:41:38.353]  All the way around the world.
[02:41:38.353 --> 02:41:43.738]  Well did you see that McClatchy series of investigative reports we had him on last Friday?
[02:41:43.738 --> 02:41:45.379]  This top investigative journalist.
[02:41:45.379 --> 02:41:50.364]  They got the internal documents where Goldman Sachs planned the implosion of the housing market.
[02:41:50.364 --> 02:41:55.788]  They sold all these housing stocks while betting against them to destroy their competition.
[02:41:55.788 --> 02:41:57.970]  I mean this is a cold-blooded group.
[02:41:57.970 --> 02:41:58.931]  Of course it is.
[02:41:58.931 --> 02:42:01.293]  And notice their people are all the top federal regulators.
[02:42:02.193 --> 02:42:03.173]  Of course.
[02:42:03.173 --> 02:42:08.616]  And you point that out very, very, very clearly in Fall of the Republic.
[02:42:08.616 --> 02:42:11.177]  And friends, this thing is so much bigger.
[02:42:11.177 --> 02:42:14.198]  And there's one other point that I would like to make before I go.
[02:42:14.198 --> 02:42:21.822]  The United States has transported several nuclear bunker-busting bombs over to Israel.
[02:42:21.822 --> 02:42:28.285]  And there are plans right now for either an American or an American-Israeli or an Israeli attack on Iran.
[02:42:29.185 --> 02:42:34.369]  And the Iran Corporation says the globalists need World War III to get their new world order.
[02:42:34.369 --> 02:42:40.713]  Friends, this would be the most destabilizing event in the history of our lives.
[02:42:40.713 --> 02:42:47.497]  If we go in and nuke Iran, and I am not a friend of the Iranian government, I think that they're loony tunes.
[02:42:47.497 --> 02:42:49.939]  Yeah, but the globalists want to have order out of chaos.
[02:42:49.939 --> 02:42:51.160]  Of course they do.
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:58.104]  And right now, if you put together Russia, China, India, and Iran, and maybe Brazil and some of the others,
[02:42:59.045 --> 02:43:03.006]  Is that the destabilization to this country is unbelievable.
[02:43:03.006 --> 02:43:05.267]  They want World War III in Central Asia.
[02:43:05.267 --> 02:43:06.187]  Absolutely they do.
[02:43:06.187 --> 02:43:09.248]  And all you have to do is read Brzezinski's book.
[02:43:09.248 --> 02:43:10.168]  Yeah, they admit it all.
[02:43:10.168 --> 02:43:10.928]  They admit it all.
[02:43:10.928 --> 02:43:16.449]  The geopolitical master strategists are all public about this.
[02:43:16.449 --> 02:43:22.411]  And friends, all of these things, whether it's political, economic, environmental, all these things,
[02:43:22.711 --> 02:43:26.112]  All we're doing is asking you, wake up right now.
[02:43:26.112 --> 02:43:29.732]  If you care about this country, you have to make a choice.
[02:43:29.732 --> 02:43:36.113]  Either you can go along with the status quo and hide out, and if you do that, your country and your family are doomed.
[02:43:36.113 --> 02:43:37.214]  George, last question.
[02:43:37.214 --> 02:43:41.574]  Why, I mean I have my perspective, why are they openly announcing world government?
[02:43:41.574 --> 02:43:49.936]  Openly announcing the carbon tax after decades of denying it and planning in our mind it didn't exist, giving people that compulsion that it isn't real.
[02:43:49.936 --> 02:43:51.596]  Now they come out and admit everything.
[02:43:51.656 --> 02:43:53.138]  I mean that means they're really making their move.
[02:43:53.138 --> 02:43:59.606]  Well because first of all they're arrogant and from their point of view they have all their bases covered.
[02:43:59.606 --> 02:44:01.208]  And what's also...
[02:44:02.372 --> 02:44:10.576]  There is so much going on, and I would suggest that everybody watch this television show called V. That's the big hit.
[02:44:10.576 --> 02:44:14.818]  And friends, there's a lot more going on with that show than you may understand.
[02:44:14.818 --> 02:44:17.039]  They're throwing it in your face what Obama's doing.
[02:44:17.039 --> 02:44:18.340]  It's revelation of the method.
[02:44:18.340 --> 02:44:19.920]  It's all about Obama.
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:21.661]  It's all about world government.
[02:44:21.661 --> 02:44:27.144]  It's all about them telling us what they're going to do, which they have to do, which is part of their sick
[02:44:28.264 --> 02:44:35.166]  Their game, and they're putting... And notice the aliens, we're not saying it's really aliens, it's the archetype, are going to suck all our resources.
[02:44:35.166 --> 02:44:35.546]  Of course.
[02:44:35.546 --> 02:44:40.448]  Cap and trade is about shutting everything off to us, training us that we're saving the earth.
[02:44:40.448 --> 02:44:44.269]  I mean, these people are saying, oh, V's exposing Obama.
[02:44:44.269 --> 02:44:44.749]  No!
[02:44:44.749 --> 02:44:46.810]  They're telling you what they're doing.
[02:44:46.810 --> 02:44:49.991]  Just like when I talk about the New World Order, they go, you mean Hulk Hogan.
[02:44:49.991 --> 02:44:55.353]  Now when I talk about a global elite shutting off our resources to exterminate us, they go, oh, you mean V. George,
[02:44:56.013 --> 02:44:56.814]  Talk to the producer.
[02:44:56.814 --> 02:44:57.835]  How long are you going to be in Austin?
[02:44:57.835 --> 02:44:59.957]  I'm going to be here for about another 10-12 days.
[02:44:59.957 --> 02:45:03.080]  Why don't we set you up right now for a full hour sometime next week?
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:04.141]  I love being here, Alex.
[02:45:04.141 --> 02:45:05.122]  George, awesome having you.
[02:45:05.122 --> 02:45:07.264]  You are awesome, I love you, and have a great show.
[02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:08.265]  Thank you, love you too.
[02:45:08.265 --> 02:45:10.747]  Okay, folks, he's a big part of Fall of the Republic.
[02:45:10.747 --> 02:45:12.529]  Get the DVD, get it out to everybody.
[02:45:12.529 --> 02:45:14.591]  This thing is powerful, it exposes their agenda.
[02:45:15.071 --> 02:45:16.474]  And you hear the buzz is great on the street.
[02:45:16.474 --> 02:45:20.703]  We're going to play a few minutes of Jesse Ventura from our interview yesterday.
[02:45:20.703 --> 02:45:24.891]  And then we're going to come live in studio with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[02:45:24.891 --> 02:45:25.512]  Stay with us.
[02:45:25.512 --> 02:45:26.093]  We'll be right back.
[02:45:28.038 --> 02:45:35.180]  Well, we're into our number two simulcasting the syndicated radio transmission at PrisonPlanet.TV and Living Color.
[02:45:35.180 --> 02:45:44.763]  Joining us from Minnesota, he's about to travel down to Mexico to do some surfing, is former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:45:44.763 --> 02:45:50.965]  Of course, a star of films like The Running Man, Predator, and many other films.
[02:45:50.965 --> 02:45:54.486]  He's hosted a MSNBC national television show.
[02:45:55.246 --> 02:45:57.607]  He's hosted NFL football.
[02:45:57.607 --> 02:45:59.788]  There's not much this guy hadn't done.
[02:45:59.788 --> 02:46:01.348]  And now he's got a huge show.
[02:46:01.348 --> 02:46:03.889]  They're saying it's going to be their big push in the winter.
[02:46:03.889 --> 02:46:05.449]  Their big number one promoted show.
[02:46:05.449 --> 02:46:08.210]  And I'm seeing that now in the media.
[02:46:08.210 --> 02:46:11.491]  That's Conspiracy Theory, created by Jesse Ventura.
[02:46:11.491 --> 02:46:12.592]  I'm a consultant on it.
[02:46:12.592 --> 02:46:13.672]  I'm in some of the episodes.
[02:46:13.672 --> 02:46:16.133]  I'm very honored to be involved in it.
[02:46:16.133 --> 02:46:19.134]  And to give you the inside scoop, he starts the media blitz tomorrow.
[02:46:19.694 --> 02:46:21.115]  Hi Alex, great to be here again.
[02:46:21.115 --> 02:46:22.015]  I guess I should call you Huggy Bear.
[02:46:39.226 --> 02:46:40.987]  And I'll explain that for a moment.
[02:46:40.987 --> 02:46:43.909]  Now, Alex has been good enough.
[02:46:43.909 --> 02:46:48.112]  He appears in a couple of the episodes of Conspiracy Theory that we did.
[02:46:48.112 --> 02:46:58.338]  And so, because he's the only really reoccurring character we've ever had in the first initial bite, we went back to the old Starsky and Hutch show.
[02:46:58.338 --> 02:47:00.299]  And y'all remember Huggy Bear, don't you?
[02:47:00.299 --> 02:47:04.082]  The guy that always brought the information to Starsky and Hutch?
[02:47:04.082 --> 02:47:06.223]  Well, that's you now, Alex.
[02:47:06.223 --> 02:47:07.384]  So you're our Huggy Bear.
[02:47:08.683 --> 02:47:12.005]  Well, I'm honored to be your huggy bear.
[02:47:12.005 --> 02:47:14.427]  You've not been able to talk about the show till now.
[02:47:14.427 --> 02:47:16.048]  They've unleashed you.
[02:47:16.048 --> 02:47:20.271]  You barely talked about it on Larry King Live last week.
[02:47:20.271 --> 02:47:30.078]  But now you've been given the green light to give people a foretaste or an idea of what's going to be in the seven episodes.
[02:47:30.078 --> 02:47:31.539]  And so we're all ears, Governor.
[02:47:31.539 --> 02:47:32.960]  I mean, tell us about some of the episodes.
[02:47:33.260 --> 02:47:46.331]  Well, first of all, when I went on Larry, it was because, you know, it was election night and Larry truly wanted my opinion on the latest off-year elections, which I'll do this right now.
[02:47:46.331 --> 02:47:49.074]  To me, why do they even have off-year elections?
[02:47:49.074 --> 02:47:51.156]  It's hard enough to get people out there to vote.
[02:47:51.916 --> 02:47:53.897]  I have them all on here.
[02:47:53.897 --> 02:47:59.680]  They do that so that they get a small voter turnout because it's easier to control small numbers.
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:01.802]  And so that's why that happens, pretty much.
[02:48:01.802 --> 02:48:18.191]  But that being said, that's why I was on Larry was mainly for the election stuff, not so much a promotion of the show, because I'll be going back on Larry later on the end of the month, right when it gets to the debut date, which of course is December the 2nd on the True Channel.
[02:48:19.371 --> 02:48:20.232]  We're good to go.
[02:48:34.185 --> 02:48:37.127]  Hold on, we're about to go to break and I don't want to stop you.
[02:48:37.127 --> 02:48:53.035]  I want you to have free flow and go over as much as you can tell us about the episodes because I've consulted some but I still only have a few pieces of the overall puzzle and I know that you've stated that you believe this is fair and from our perspective probably the first television show ever that's actually from
[02:48:53.675 --> 02:48:55.237]  People who questions perspective.
[02:48:55.237 --> 02:48:59.343]  That doesn't mean that you or I or anybody buys all of what's being said out there.
[02:48:59.343 --> 02:49:01.847]  So I want to talk about that when we come back in just a minute.
[02:49:01.847 --> 02:49:09.678]  But in the one minute we've got, what is your take on Republicans sweeping all over the country and Obama's plunging approval rating?
[02:49:10.287 --> 02:49:13.389]  Well, I don't think it's so much Republicans sweeping.
[02:49:26.155 --> 02:49:27.176]  Why is she in Austin?
[02:49:27.176 --> 02:49:31.781]  She's been having a health department debate at the University of Texas, was at another event today.
[02:49:31.781 --> 02:49:41.391]  We'll give you the inside scoop, the latest flu developments from the number one person out there fighting the vaccines and exposing a medical doctor, Sherry Tenpenny.
[02:49:41.391 --> 02:49:45.975]  Before I break, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio broadcast.
[02:49:46.636 --> 02:49:47.177]  Possible.
[02:49:47.177 --> 02:49:50.299]  One of them is eFoodsDirect, eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:49:50.299 --> 02:49:53.781]  This is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[02:49:53.781 --> 02:49:55.723]  It's non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[02:49:55.723 --> 02:49:58.645]  It's all grown right here in the U.S., all recently packed.
[02:49:58.645 --> 02:50:01.087]  Their bananas are from outside the U.S., that's it.
[02:50:01.087 --> 02:50:04.669]  And you're not buying ten-year-old stuff or year-old stuff or six-month-old stuff.
[02:50:04.669 --> 02:50:06.210]  They pack it constantly.
[02:50:06.210 --> 02:50:10.013]  The J. Michael Stevens Group, the website is eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:50:10.013 --> 02:50:12.775]  With all the crazy talk of war and depression and
[02:50:12.935 --> 02:50:13.515]  Let's go.
[02:50:33.780 --> 02:50:42.247]  We're going to come back and go to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny here in studio and cover all the big developments with the flu and her debate.
[02:50:42.247 --> 02:50:45.690]  It almost didn't happen because they couldn't find anybody to debate her.
[02:50:45.690 --> 02:50:54.577]  So that is coming up after this quick break and the websites of course are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:50:54.577 --> 02:50:54.977]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.992 --> 02:51:03.773]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[02:51:03.773 --> 02:51:05.275]  Say no to toxic overload.
[02:51:05.275 --> 02:51:06.616]  Say no to chemicals.
[02:51:06.616 --> 02:51:08.538]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[02:51:08.538 --> 02:51:17.266]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[02:51:17.346 --> 02:51:22.770]  Chemical-free Liquid Zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[02:51:22.770 --> 02:51:24.551]  Why risk government vaccinations?

[02:52:02.964 --> 02:52:06.988]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.988 --> 02:52:10.231]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:10.231 --> 02:52:11.652]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:12.372 --> 02:52:15.033]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:15.033 --> 02:52:21.416]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.416 --> 02:52:26.619]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.619 --> 02:52:36.604]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.724 --> 02:52:39.066]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:39.066 --> 02:52:40.647]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.647 --> 02:52:43.109]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:43.109 --> 02:52:45.230]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.230 --> 02:52:50.394]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:50.394 --> 02:52:55.398]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:53:01.448 --> 02:53:02.108]  Hello.
[02:53:02.108 --> 02:53:06.871]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[02:53:06.871 --> 02:53:11.674]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[02:53:11.674 --> 02:53:16.816]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[02:53:16.816 --> 02:53:20.919]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[02:53:20.919 --> 02:53:24.961]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[02:53:24.961 --> 02:53:27.762]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[02:53:27.762 --> 02:53:28.643]  It was empowering.
[02:53:28.783 --> 02:53:32.769]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[02:53:32.769 --> 02:53:35.592]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[02:53:35.592 --> 02:53:38.436]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[02:53:38.436 --> 02:53:39.438]  Thank you so much.
[02:53:39.438 --> 02:53:42.282]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[02:53:42.282 --> 02:53:43.043]  Thanks again.
[02:53:43.043 --> 02:53:45.666]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[02:53:46.405 --> 02:53:49.809]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[02:53:49.809 --> 02:53:53.413]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[02:53:53.413 --> 02:53:57.418]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[02:54:09.201 --> 02:54:12.122]  Okay, I'm going to clear the call board for the next talent.
[02:54:12.122 --> 02:54:18.105]  Sorry to folks holding, but only vaccine questions for Dr. Sherry Tinpenny coming up in studio 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:18.105 --> 02:54:24.188]  DrTinpenny.com is one of her great websites.
[02:54:24.188 --> 02:54:26.189]  She's a best-selling author, medical doctor.
[02:54:26.889 --> 02:54:28.251]  She really needs no introduction.
[02:54:28.251 --> 02:54:38.006]  For over a decade, she's been one of the main voices out there, eloquently, in a focused way, even on mainstream television and radio, exposing what's happening with the vaccines.
[02:54:38.006 --> 02:54:41.411]  And here to tell us why she's in Austin is Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[02:54:41.411 --> 02:54:42.072]  It's great to have you.
[02:54:42.372 --> 02:54:44.353]  Thanks Alex, it's a pleasure to be here.
[02:54:44.353 --> 02:54:46.194]  Yeah, we had a really fun meeting last night.
[02:54:46.194 --> 02:54:53.177]  It was sponsored by the University of Texas, the Libertarian Party, and a big group of people who actually said it was just great to have there.
[02:54:53.177 --> 02:55:02.382]  We had, to my knowledge, this is the first time ever that a public health department official, who is a Region 7 official, agreed to debate in a public forum
[02:55:02.822 --> 02:55:06.943]  The pro and con side of vaccines and particularly vaccine mandates.
[02:55:06.943 --> 02:55:08.383]  So it was a really good meeting.
[02:55:08.383 --> 02:55:09.364]  There were a lot of people there.
[02:55:09.364 --> 02:55:11.324]  There was phenomenal questions.
[02:55:11.324 --> 02:55:13.065]  It was kind of a controlled forum.
[02:55:13.065 --> 02:55:20.167]  I mean, there was a set of questions that we had ahead of time that we were able to put together answers for.
[02:55:20.167 --> 02:55:21.587]  Then there were some spontaneous questions.
[02:55:21.587 --> 02:55:25.448]  And then we had an hour of interviews of questions from the audience that were really good.
[02:55:25.788 --> 02:55:29.430]  In fact, we probably could have stayed there another hour just asking all the questions.
[02:55:29.430 --> 02:55:32.411]  And the health department officials, they were really kind of backed against the wall.
[02:55:32.411 --> 02:55:43.176]  Not necessarily in a bad way, but a way that they really, for the first time, I think, really heard people say that vaccines are not safe, they are not effective, they don't protect you, and yes, they do cause harm.
[02:55:43.703 --> 02:55:46.845]  Well, two weeks ago we had the Dallas County Health Department head on.
[02:55:46.845 --> 02:55:50.767]  He said, yes, the inserts say it can give you Guillain-Barre or other neurological disorders.
[02:55:50.767 --> 02:55:52.868]  Yes, it can sterilize you or hurt your fertility.
[02:55:52.868 --> 02:55:54.749]  Yes, it can cause autoimmune disease.
[02:55:54.749 --> 02:55:56.149]  Yes, it has mercury in it.
[02:55:56.149 --> 02:55:58.831]  Yes, the nasal is live and can spread it.
[02:55:58.831 --> 02:56:02.893]  And I had people calling and freaking out going, we thought you were just saying this, Alex.
[02:56:02.893 --> 02:56:04.734]  No, it's in the inserts.
[02:56:04.734 --> 02:56:06.875]  The health department heads will actually admit this.
[02:56:07.735 --> 02:56:13.777]  But then the schools and the federal government are handing out fake info sheets, as you know, saying none of this is true.
[02:56:13.777 --> 02:56:22.199]  I think that backfired on them because now people actually ask for the real drug insert and they're going, whoa, I didn't know this was going on.
[02:56:22.199 --> 02:56:25.439]  So it does seem that they've ignored us in the past.
[02:56:25.439 --> 02:56:27.540]  Now they're being forced to come down off their mountain.
[02:56:28.300 --> 02:56:32.863]  Because doctors in Europe, doctors in Germany, doctors here, nurses are refusing to take it.
[02:56:32.863 --> 02:56:37.886]  Am I right in saying, because you're right at the center of this Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, that this is really blowing up in their face.
[02:56:37.886 --> 02:56:45.090]  They tried this offensive to set the precedent for forced inoculation and for this hoax, this panic, and it's blown up in their face.
[02:56:45.450 --> 02:56:46.070]  I agree.
[02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.510]  I agree.
[02:56:46.510 --> 02:56:49.171]  And I think that we've done several things.
[02:56:49.171 --> 02:56:56.374]  One of the other websites that I have that I'm a co-developer of is a website that's pandemicfluonline.com.
[02:56:56.374 --> 02:56:58.715]  It's pandemicfluonline.com.
[02:56:58.715 --> 02:57:03.457]  And one of the things that we did that I think really made a difference was that we gave people tools.
[02:57:03.697 --> 02:57:07.379]  You know, we're always telling people to get busy, get out, get active, do things.
[02:57:07.379 --> 02:57:17.023]  And so what we did on this website was we gave people downloadable flyers, downloadable PowerPoint presentations, downloadable things that they could start back in August handing things out.
[02:57:17.023 --> 02:57:18.504]  Because we knew it was coming.
[02:57:18.504 --> 02:57:20.965]  We knew it was coming from, it's the annual flu shot every year.
[02:57:20.965 --> 02:57:23.326]  We knew the swine flu stuff was coming this year.
[02:57:23.326 --> 02:57:26.948]  And thousands and thousands of people were handling those things out.
[02:57:26.948 --> 02:57:28.729]  And I think that they were really taken back.
[02:57:28.729 --> 02:57:31.310]  I think they were blown back by the response that people have had.
[02:57:31.650 --> 02:57:35.731]  So the work that you did, the work that we've done, I think has really made a difference this time around.
[02:57:35.731 --> 02:57:44.292]  And by the way, I've seen major British newspapers with the health heads saying extremists, terrorists are handing out flyers.
[02:57:44.292 --> 02:57:45.793]  They're all over London.
[02:57:45.793 --> 02:57:52.754]  And I think a lot of listeners saw the success of our Obama Joker poster making hundreds of newspapers and TV stations.
[02:57:52.754 --> 02:57:55.054]  And they really picked up on your flyers.
[02:57:55.054 --> 02:57:57.075]  And it's just been incredibly explosive.
[02:57:57.075 --> 02:57:59.715]  The people are learning how much power they've got.
[02:57:59.915 --> 02:58:01.296]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:58:01.296 --> 02:58:08.459]  I think that people don't realize that, you know, if they just take those flyers and they do things like, um, I used to, I have a whole stack of them in the back of my car.
[02:58:08.459 --> 02:58:11.380]  When I go into the mall, I just take them with me and I just hand them out to people.
[02:58:11.380 --> 02:58:13.781]  I don't even try to engage a conversation.
[02:58:13.781 --> 02:58:19.444]  I just say, here's some information I think you may want to look at and just hand it and you never know whose hands that that might end up in.
[02:58:19.824 --> 02:58:26.450]  I've gone to little community workshops where they've printed out all these flyers and they have them there and they're handing them out to all sorts of people.
[02:58:26.450 --> 02:58:28.932]  So people are really taking charge.
[02:58:28.932 --> 02:58:32.375]  We had a big long conversation about this last night at the health department.
[02:58:32.375 --> 02:58:32.895]  Stay there.
[02:58:32.895 --> 02:58:37.059]  Back in 70 seconds with the fourth and final hour with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[02:58:37.059 --> 02:58:39.201]  We'll give you all the websites.
[02:58:39.201 --> 02:58:43.444]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.444 --> 02:58:44.765]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.758 --> 02:58:52.781]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.781 --> 02:58:56.804]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.804 --> 02:59:00.045]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:59:00.045 --> 02:59:04.848]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.848 --> 02:59:11.232]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:11.232 --> 02:59:13.473]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.993 --> 02:59:14.313]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:14.313 --> 02:59:14.814]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.814 --> 02:59:15.614]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.614 --> 02:59:16.775]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.775 --> 02:59:19.016]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.904 --> 02:59:35.025]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:35.025 --> 02:59:40.187]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:40.187 --> 02:59:54.634]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:54.634 --> 02:59:57.035]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:57.035 --> 02:59:59.796]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:36.495]  Well, medical doctor, Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, an osteopathic medical doctor from Cleveland, Ohio, board certification in emergency medicine and osteopathic manual medicine at her integrative medical clinic focused on allergy elimination, including treatment of children with asthma and allergies at Women's Health using bioidentical hormones and breast
[03:00:39.157 --> 03:00:48.979]  Well, I mean, you tell us your bio, because you've done so much.
[03:00:48.979 --> 03:00:53.901]  You were probably the leading person in the last decade exposing vaccines.
[03:00:53.901 --> 03:00:55.261]  You had a big debate last night.
[03:00:55.261 --> 03:00:56.302]  I want to get into that.
[03:00:56.302 --> 03:01:04.404]  I want to just sit back and let you tell the listeners the latest developments with the flu, the forced inoculations in public schools they've been caught doing, and then saying, oops, we messed up.
[03:01:05.105 --> 03:01:08.110]  The rebellion by doctors worldwide.
[03:01:08.110 --> 03:01:13.240]  It looks like this flu scam has really stalled, dead in its tracks.
[03:01:13.240 --> 03:01:14.702]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, you got the floor.
[03:01:15.430 --> 03:01:19.533]  One of the things that we did was we created tools for people to get out and get active.
[03:01:19.533 --> 03:01:25.337]  We created flyers and small PowerPoint presentations and we put them on our website, pandemicfluonline.com.
[03:01:25.337 --> 03:01:28.159]  They're also on dr10penny.com, which is my website.
[03:01:28.159 --> 03:01:31.181]  And we've done just an amazing amount of things to get people active.
[03:01:31.181 --> 03:01:37.686]  And I think that there's more people that are asking questions and are being part of what's happening right now than ever before.
[03:01:37.686 --> 03:01:43.330]  I mean, 10 years ago, when we started talking about all these things that had to do with vaccines, there was barely a voice.
[03:01:43.330 --> 03:01:44.691]  There was hardly anybody listening.
[03:01:45.191 --> 03:01:48.774]  And now what they're doing is more and more people are getting involved.
[03:01:48.774 --> 03:01:49.874]  People are asking questions.
[03:01:49.874 --> 03:01:51.095]  People are saying no.
[03:01:51.095 --> 03:01:52.676]  People are challenging their doctors.
[03:01:52.676 --> 03:01:55.838]  They're finding out that they don't need a pediatrician if they have healthy children.
[03:01:55.838 --> 03:02:02.283]  They can find other types of health care practitioners to help them stay well and stay out of the vaccination lines.
[03:02:03.607 --> 03:02:15.934]  Going back to April, and I had said in January they're going to stage some flu hype because I saw the federal government in FEMA getting ready with local police departments, saying get ready for mass graves, a big pandemic's coming.
[03:02:15.934 --> 03:02:18.215]  The flu makers were quietly gearing up.
[03:02:18.215 --> 03:02:19.216]  They knew this was coming.
[03:02:19.216 --> 03:02:22.578]  A lot of scientists say it's clearly been designed.
[03:02:22.578 --> 03:02:28.241]  Then we saw the hype in the aftermath, the attempt to make it mandatory in New York and in Massachusetts.
[03:02:29.943 --> 03:02:32.890]  I mean, I know you're a scientist, a doctor, a researcher, a journalist.
[03:02:32.890 --> 03:02:36.559]  You go off what you can prove, but in your gut, is this whole thing staged?
[03:02:38.024 --> 03:02:41.386]  I think that there is some staging to it.
[03:02:41.386 --> 03:02:44.987]  And what I'm really concerned about is the next wave that's going to come along.
[03:02:44.987 --> 03:02:51.530]  I think that these people, they pushed way too hard to get everybody vaccinated for what was known to be a mild virus.
[03:02:51.530 --> 03:02:54.792]  It wasn't any different than any other influenza virus that we've seen before.
[03:02:54.792 --> 03:02:56.493]  And they pushed way too hard.
[03:02:56.493 --> 03:02:58.513]  Now we're seeing some things sort of fall through the cracks.
[03:02:58.513 --> 03:03:01.375]  I'm real concerned about the stuff that's happening in the Ukraine.
[03:03:01.375 --> 03:03:03.796]  I mean, we don't know for sure what's happening over there.
[03:03:04.096 --> 03:03:11.200]  We really don't know what's going to happen come wintertime when the Winter Olympics is in Vancouver and there's a whole group of people that are there from all over the world.
[03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:13.981]  I mean, what's going to happen then?
[03:03:13.981 --> 03:03:16.783]  I'm really concerned about the accidents that are happening in schools.
[03:03:16.783 --> 03:03:23.006]  These kids are getting two and three and four flu shots, you know, that they get the regular flu shot, the swine flu shot.
[03:03:23.006 --> 03:03:25.347]  I'm super concerned about the flu mist vaccine.
[03:03:25.347 --> 03:03:27.328]  Maybe it was an accident with Jeffrey Dahmer.
[03:03:27.328 --> 03:03:28.409]  Maybe that was all an accident.
[03:03:28.829 --> 03:03:30.771]  I mean, it's always an accident.
[03:03:30.771 --> 03:03:33.794]  If you or I injected a child whose parents were against it, we'd go to jail.
[03:03:33.794 --> 03:03:36.297]  But when they have accidents, oopsie, no big deal.
[03:03:36.297 --> 03:03:41.302]  Yeah, and they always say that, you know, these kids got multiple flu shots and they were safe.
[03:03:41.302 --> 03:03:42.243]  Nothing had happened.
[03:03:42.243 --> 03:03:47.008]  Well, you can't say that because you don't know what's going to happen two weeks, two months, two years from now.
[03:03:47.148 --> 03:03:52.833]  Well, we're also only finding out about mainly children that collapse and go to the hospital.
[03:03:52.833 --> 03:03:57.036]  That's what we found out in New York and other states that they had done a secret inoculation.
[03:03:57.036 --> 03:04:02.801]  And notice, the accidents are all with elementary students, where they think the children won't be able to explain the story.
[03:04:02.801 --> 03:04:06.864]  And we caught schools denying they'd done it, and then later it would come out they had.
[03:04:06.864 --> 03:04:07.885]  So they're also lying.
[03:04:07.885 --> 03:04:10.027]  I mean, this is really creepy and criminal.
[03:04:10.487 --> 03:04:12.308]  It varies much, creepy and criminal.
[03:04:12.308 --> 03:04:16.111]  And it's like, parents should have some recourse to that.
[03:04:16.111 --> 03:04:22.715]  Now, I don't think that the parents can actually sue the school system because they have to prove that something had harmed them.
[03:04:22.715 --> 03:04:24.476]  But I think they can go after the school boards.
[03:04:24.476 --> 03:04:25.497]  They can vote them out.
[03:04:25.497 --> 03:04:30.240]  They can show up at the school boards every single session that they have and force them to give them an answer.
[03:04:30.240 --> 03:04:31.981]  They can say, where is our money going?
[03:04:31.981 --> 03:04:35.444]  How much money are you getting, school board, for doing these inoculations in these school systems?
[03:04:36.064 --> 03:04:38.726]  And I think that parents need to be really, really proactive.
[03:04:38.726 --> 03:04:40.348]  Because this is just the first step.
[03:04:40.348 --> 03:04:43.110]  If they're doing this with flu shots, what's going to be the next thing?
[03:04:43.110 --> 03:04:45.652]  Are you going to inoculate kids at school with Gardasil?
[03:04:45.652 --> 03:04:46.833]  Okay, stay there.
[03:04:46.833 --> 03:04:48.815]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest.
[03:04:48.815 --> 03:04:50.276]  We're going to come back, long segment.
[03:04:50.276 --> 03:04:56.901]  We're going to go over the flu, Gardasil, the forced inoculations, what's happening in Ukraine, what she thinks is coming up next.
[03:04:56.901 --> 03:04:59.243]  But first, we'll talk about the debate last night.
[03:04:59.243 --> 03:05:00.524]  Get some details from her on that.
[03:05:01.468 --> 03:05:10.611]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:05:10.611 --> 03:05:13.992]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:05:13.992 --> 03:05:19.854]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:05:19.854 --> 03:05:24.635]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:05:24.635 --> 03:05:26.976]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:05:27.176 --> 03:05:27.576]  Thank you.
[03:05:46.087 --> 03:05:49.813]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[03:05:49.813 --> 03:05:51.996]  That's O-X-Y Silver dot net.

[03:05:58.526 --> 03:05:58.986]  Do it now.
[03:06:02.128 --> 03:06:05.149]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:05.149 --> 03:06:10.470]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:10.470 --> 03:06:12.531]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:12.531 --> 03:06:17.533]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:17.533 --> 03:06:18.713]  How much do you want?
[03:06:18.713 --> 03:06:19.833]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.833 --> 03:06:21.714]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.714 --> 03:06:22.794]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.794 --> 03:06:24.995]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.995 --> 03:06:26.335]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:26.335 --> 03:06:27.856]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.856 --> 03:06:28.856]  If there's a quarantine,
[03:06:29.076 --> 03:06:29.477]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.780 --> 03:06:48.822]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:07:01.152 --> 03:07:08.136]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:07:08.136 --> 03:07:09.416]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:07:09.416 --> 03:07:10.217]  It's very real.
[03:07:10.217 --> 03:07:14.119]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[03:07:14.119 --> 03:07:18.601]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[03:07:53.762 --> 03:08:03.370]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[03:08:03.370 --> 03:08:10.015]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:10.015 --> 03:08:12.978]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:14.448 --> 03:08:28.718]  Well, the leading fighter against the military-industrial complex Big Pharma push to force Gardasil, hepatitis shots, flu shots filled with mercury on our children is here.
[03:08:28.718 --> 03:08:32.862]  She's been debating the health department at the University of Texas at Austin.
[03:08:32.862 --> 03:08:34.403]  She is here in studio with us.
[03:08:34.403 --> 03:08:36.944]  Your calls are coming up at the bottom of the hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:08:36.944 --> 03:08:37.105]  Okay, Doc,
[03:08:40.527 --> 03:08:45.510]  Addressing folks out there in TV land and in radio land, you've got the floor.
[03:08:45.510 --> 03:09:03.943]  Whatever you think is most important to talk about, I'd like to first hear about the debate last night, what you did today, and then your concerns about this being a preparatory phase for something bigger this year or next year, what's happening in Ukraine, the good news that people are resisting, the bad news that the government's still trying to push it.
[03:09:03.943 --> 03:09:05.664]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, give us a report.
[03:09:06.513 --> 03:09:11.534]  Well, last night was a really interesting evening with the officials from the health department.
[03:09:11.534 --> 03:09:15.136]  We had the person that was on stage with us, which was great, Dr. Betz.
[03:09:15.136 --> 03:09:16.776]  I mean, he really was a trooper.
[03:09:16.776 --> 03:09:24.718]  I mean, he actually had said to us before we started the talk, we went up and introduced ourselves and said, thank you for coming and we really like to have you.
[03:09:24.718 --> 03:09:26.639]  We're really glad that you're willing to do this.
[03:09:27.379 --> 03:09:29.582]  And he said, well, nobody else really wanted to do it.
[03:09:29.582 --> 03:09:31.125]  And I said, well, why is that?
[03:09:31.125 --> 03:09:32.186]  He says, here's your opportunity.
[03:09:32.186 --> 03:09:37.654]  Here's your floor in terms of your opportunity to tell your whole side of the story.
[03:09:37.654 --> 03:09:40.258]  And he said, well, we've done things like this before and they haven't gone well.
[03:09:40.822 --> 03:09:42.143]  And I think it really did go well.
[03:09:42.143 --> 03:09:44.504]  I think that we had a very respectful audience.
[03:09:44.504 --> 03:09:50.748]  I think that we had an opportunity to have questions ahead of time that we had answered.
[03:09:50.748 --> 03:09:57.272]  Some of the questions were things like, do we really think that the H1N1 vaccine was really going to be the cause of the pandemic?
[03:09:57.992 --> 03:10:08.865]  And one of the things that I said was, well, I think that the flu mist has a risk because that's a live virus vaccine that's being going up everybody's nose and that you can shed that virus for up to 21 days.
[03:10:08.865 --> 03:10:12.429]  But that I have a personally a bigger concern about Tamiflu.
[03:10:12.970 --> 03:10:22.233]  And that I think that Tamiflu and even the scientific literature talks about 16% of the viruses each year become resistant to Tamiflu.
[03:10:22.233 --> 03:10:35.837]  So if we start creating very resistant mutant viruses and those mutant viruses get out into the environment and they're resistant and they start to do this thing called reassortment and come together and create an even bigger virus that is going to be even more of a problem.
[03:10:36.797 --> 03:10:38.559]  And they sort of agreed with that.
[03:10:38.559 --> 03:10:46.865]  One of the questions that got asked to me was, is there any evidence in the medical literature that vaccines have caused harm and problems?
[03:10:46.865 --> 03:11:03.218]  And I was really glad that that came to me because, you know, I spend most of my life researching the problems with vaccines and I know that I've personally done more than 350 articles that have pulled looking at all the different problems with all of the different vaccines, particularly hepatitis B, the things with the flu shot,
[03:11:03.758 --> 03:11:04.238]  I think?
[03:11:22.026 --> 03:11:27.392]  They weren't in much agreement when Don Richardson from Prove and I were doing sort of a back and forth.
[03:11:27.392 --> 03:11:32.939]  But they couldn't deny the fact that there was another whole side of this story.
[03:11:32.939 --> 03:11:37.023]  They couldn't deny the fact that we were telling them what the science and the research was.
[03:11:37.023 --> 03:11:41.469]  They darted and danced around a lot of the issues sometimes when people were asking them about mandates.
[03:11:42.129 --> 03:11:44.390]  They never did give really straight answers.
[03:11:44.390 --> 03:11:56.874]  And I think that Texas, at least from what they said last night, and I'm really glad that Alex, that people were there filming this, because they were saying in quite strong language that we're not going to see mandates in Texas.
[03:11:56.874 --> 03:11:59.155]  Flu shots will not be mandated in Texas.
[03:11:59.155 --> 03:12:04.277]  And I think that if there becomes a problem down the road with this flu shot shortage, and if they think it gets worse over the winter,
[03:12:04.597 --> 03:12:06.778]  And they start pulling this stuff about mandates.
[03:12:06.778 --> 03:12:14.083]  I hope that now you've got recording on footage that you can go back and challenge them on that to saying that you are backing out on your word.
[03:12:14.083 --> 03:12:19.247]  Just to jump in briefly, the problem is, as you know, they do this color of law.
[03:12:19.247 --> 03:12:22.829]  They tell parents it's mandatory your children take the flu shot.
[03:12:22.829 --> 03:12:25.131]  They've been announcing all children must take it all over the country.
[03:12:25.951 --> 03:12:32.494]  And then they kick your child out saying they violated policy and then trigger truancy laws.
[03:12:32.494 --> 03:12:49.083]  So they kick you out themselves, then they trigger the truancy provision, and then have a few examples of a couple parents they haul into court, and then the news announced parents have been arrested or parents have been charged for not vaccinating, when really
[03:12:50.103 --> 03:12:53.627]  The school knows they have that vaccine waiver exemption form.
[03:12:53.627 --> 03:12:57.090]  They never tell you and engage in the crime of kicking your child out.
[03:12:57.090 --> 03:13:00.213]  It's like Governor Rick Perry two years ago says, it's mandatory.
[03:13:00.213 --> 03:13:02.595]  All girls in Texas must take Gardasil.
[03:13:02.595 --> 03:13:05.778]  Then federal vaccine liability protection kicks in.
[03:13:05.778 --> 03:13:08.901]  Merck knows in their own trials it killed and maimed people.
[03:13:08.901 --> 03:13:11.224]  Now nationwide they announce all girls must take it.
[03:13:11.764 --> 03:13:20.146]  But really he just said it's a recommended through the health department that it be listed on the group that they say it's school policy you take.
[03:13:20.146 --> 03:13:26.608]  So they dance around this because with people that are ignorant they come in and lie and say you must take these shots.
[03:13:26.608 --> 03:13:35.470]  I mean I've read reports in mainstream news about parents having their children CPS taken or trying to take them for not taking hepatitis shots with a newborn baby.
[03:13:35.470 --> 03:13:36.370]  There's no law
[03:13:36.710 --> 03:13:39.151]  How are they taking your children saying it's neglect?
[03:13:39.151 --> 03:13:42.512]  Can you speak to that, how deceptive these people are?
[03:13:42.512 --> 03:13:45.513]  Yeah, I think it's really important for people to think about that.
[03:13:45.513 --> 03:13:59.539]  When parents go to the hospitals and they're going to have their baby, I mean, I always say the place where you need to intercede, actually at the very beginning place where I think people need to intercede and investigate the vaccine issue, is when they're dating somebody.
[03:14:00.279 --> 03:14:09.087]  Because at that point in time, you're probably talking about how your families get along, you're talking about religion and politics and money and living and jobs and careers.
[03:14:09.087 --> 03:14:18.775]  You really need to discuss the vaccination issue because it may turn out that one person in the party is totally against vaccines and the other person is totally for vaccines.
[03:14:18.775 --> 03:14:24.260]  Now can you imagine getting married and bringing a child into that and at that point in time having this huge contention?
[03:14:24.680 --> 03:14:35.124]  And I have testified in far too many court cases where that parent, one parent has tried to use vaccination as a child abuse issue against the other parent so that they don't have to pay child support.
[03:14:35.124 --> 03:14:37.245]  That happened with Charlie Sheen.
[03:14:37.245 --> 03:14:40.406]  Denise, and I know you know Charlie, you've talked to him.
[03:14:40.406 --> 03:14:54.132]  Denise Richards in the divorce and then in trying to take him away so he couldn't see him said he believes 9-11 was an inside job and he believes vaccines might hurt his girls when it's on record that vaccines have damaged incredible amounts of people.
[03:14:54.392 --> 03:14:55.452]  Absolutely.
[03:14:55.452 --> 03:15:05.237]  So I sort of tell people that before you go to the hospital to have a baby, you know, you need to know what you want to do about the hepatitis B vaccine, the vitamin K shot, you know, all of those things.
[03:15:05.237 --> 03:15:07.177]  But I think it really should start before that.
[03:15:07.177 --> 03:15:18.482]  And I actually have a friend in Cleveland who's a nurse midwife that she will not accept a client as a client unless both the mother and the father are in agreement about vaccination.
[03:15:18.482 --> 03:15:20.023]  What's your view on the vitamin K?
[03:15:21.127 --> 03:15:24.990]  I think that there are a lot of reasons to put that off.
[03:15:24.990 --> 03:15:36.480]  The vitamin K shot was actually put into play in the hospital ostensibly because of blood disorders and because of the very, very remote risk of bleeding that can happen in the brain if you don't have vitamin K on board.
[03:15:36.960 --> 03:15:45.425]  But vitamin K starts to be developed in the neonatal liver at about 7 days and the vitamin K shot was also instituted because of circumcision.
[03:15:45.425 --> 03:15:48.166]  The circumcision was always done at 7 to 8 days.
[03:15:48.166 --> 03:15:52.228]  It was a Jewish tradition and that they did it at 7 days.
[03:15:52.228 --> 03:16:00.733]  When they started doing the circumcision in the hospital on day 2 and 3, the baby hadn't already been producing enough vitamin K in their liver so that there would be bleeding.
[03:16:00.953 --> 03:16:06.095]  Isn't it amazing that the rabbis knew thousands of years ago to do it on seven days when they had blood clotting?
[03:16:06.095 --> 03:16:07.015]  Exactly.
[03:16:07.015 --> 03:16:08.656]  How did they know that?
[03:16:08.656 --> 03:16:10.996]  I don't know how they knew that, but they did.
[03:16:10.996 --> 03:16:11.637]  I don't know.
[03:16:11.637 --> 03:16:13.477]  It was just a tradition.
[03:16:13.477 --> 03:16:14.858]  I mean, there's a lot of things.
[03:16:14.858 --> 03:16:16.718]  I mean, how do we know from years ago?
[03:16:16.718 --> 03:16:18.239]  I don't know how to answer that.
[03:16:18.239 --> 03:16:21.000]  That's amazing.
[03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:25.361]  Let's get into Ukraine and also the adverse reaction reports.
[03:16:25.361 --> 03:16:27.242]  This Washington Redskins cheerleader
[03:16:31.115 --> 03:16:33.157]  She went to Johns Hopkins, other facilities.
[03:16:33.157 --> 03:16:35.259]  They said, yes, you've got this neurological disorder.
[03:16:35.259 --> 03:16:37.561]  The FDA said, yes, this can happen.
[03:16:37.561 --> 03:16:40.444]  And then she went and got some treatments and is getting better.
[03:16:40.444 --> 03:16:42.826]  I know Dale Dudley, 93.7 talk show host.
[03:16:42.826 --> 03:16:45.929]  He took a flu shot and months later got.
[03:16:46.830 --> 03:16:51.032]  Numb in his hands and feet, started getting paralyzed, started having trouble walking.
[03:16:51.032 --> 03:16:55.155]  He went to a bunch of specialists and medical doctors said, you had a bad vaccine reaction.
[03:16:55.155 --> 03:16:56.335]  He got better.
[03:16:56.335 --> 03:16:58.997]  Now they're trying to say it's a hoax because she got better.
[03:16:58.997 --> 03:17:04.040]  But the FDA itself says, don't worry, if you do have a neurological problem, most of the time it gets better.
[03:17:04.040 --> 03:17:10.784]  But they're trying to have it both ways, saying, well, because Desiree is getting better, it must be fake.
[03:17:10.784 --> 03:17:14.746]  But then there's all these other reports where they're admitting it's causing neurological problems.
[03:17:15.512 --> 03:17:24.559]  Yeah, it's always amazing, isn't it, that if you get sick and you haven't been vaccinated, it's because you weren't vaccinated.
[03:17:24.559 --> 03:17:28.643]  But if you had a vaccine and you have a bad reaction, it's never the vaccine.
[03:17:28.643 --> 03:17:30.985]  I mean, talk about having it both ways.
[03:17:31.505 --> 03:17:37.729]  And so, and it's amazing that even though conventional medicine completely failed this woman and had nothing to offer her.
[03:17:37.729 --> 03:17:42.652]  And then she goes and finds a physician, you know, who is actually Dr. Buttar's a friend of mine.
[03:17:42.652 --> 03:17:48.356]  And they went to his clinic and they find out that there's some things in an alternative medicine arena that can be done.
[03:17:48.356 --> 03:17:50.017]  And she starts to get better.
[03:17:50.017 --> 03:17:50.818]  Now it was a hoax.
[03:17:50.818 --> 03:17:51.838]  She was misdiagnosed.
[03:17:51.838 --> 03:17:56.962]  It couldn't possibly work because their particular tools didn't work means that there aren't any tools that work.
[03:17:56.962 --> 03:17:58.523]  That is very, very bad.
[03:17:58.683 --> 03:18:09.520]  What is Dr. Buttar and others, because he helped Jenny McCarthy and many others, you know, they're trying to, as Dr. Blalock says, reduce the autoimmune inflammation.
[03:18:09.520 --> 03:18:11.603]  They're trying to chelate and remove the metals.
[03:18:11.603 --> 03:18:13.366]  I mean, what are these treatments?
[03:18:13.817 --> 03:18:15.097]  You know, I'm not exactly sure.
[03:18:15.097 --> 03:18:19.799]  I know that there's a lot of IV treatments that are involved and I know it's all out of what you said.
[03:18:19.799 --> 03:18:25.961]  I think there's a lot of IV vitamin C, probably glutathione, probably different types of things that pull the metals out of the body.
[03:18:25.961 --> 03:18:35.785]  But it's all about rebalancing the physiology and putting the right biochemistry in and interceding quickly so that you can stop those inflammatory molecules from causing damage.
[03:18:35.945 --> 03:18:50.958]  And instead of them admitting vaccines are causing a lot of this and giving people treatments when they give their 18-month-old the third round of shots, they have a convulsion, never talk again, instead of rushing them in and saying, detox, detox, oh no, it wasn't a shot, there's no treatment, you must have shaken your baby.
[03:18:51.758 --> 03:18:56.244]  Yeah, and the other piece of that, you know, they're always talking about how much the vaccine programs cost.
[03:18:56.244 --> 03:19:05.855]  There's a cost that has never really been analyzed, Alex, that I think is really important, and you've addressed it, is the fact that if you have a bad reaction and you go to the doctor's office, now what do they do?
[03:19:05.855 --> 03:19:08.318]  They put you through all of these tests, and I'll give you one quick example.
[03:19:08.999 --> 03:19:13.461]  For example, the hepatitis B vaccine that they give babies in the hospital.
[03:19:13.461 --> 03:19:17.143]  One of the side effects, right on the package insert, is that babies can get reflux.
[03:19:17.143 --> 03:19:18.384]  They can get GERD.
[03:19:18.384 --> 03:19:20.705]  So now they start having GERD and maybe bad diarrhea.
[03:19:20.705 --> 03:19:21.965]  They take them to the pediatrician.
[03:19:21.965 --> 03:19:22.986]  What do they do?
[03:19:22.986 --> 03:19:27.388]  Upper GIs, lower NGIs, endoscopy, they do CAT scans, they do all these different things.
[03:19:27.388 --> 03:19:27.628]  Antibiotics!
[03:19:27.908 --> 03:19:36.752]  Antibiotics, all these different things to this baby, rather than going, oh, here it says right here on the package insert, this is a side effect, probably just a side effect of the vaccine.
[03:19:36.752 --> 03:19:50.077]  All of those costs, thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars of inconclusive tests, multiply that times thousands and thousands of patients, that is also a cost to the vaccine system, about vaccines.
[03:19:50.077 --> 03:19:55.459]  Well, I've talked to old pediatricians that saw kids 50 years ago, they say babies are different today.
[03:19:56.019 --> 03:19:57.039]  Something's wrong with them.
[03:19:57.039 --> 03:19:58.300]  I mean, they got dull eyes.
[03:19:58.300 --> 03:19:59.380]  They're getting brain damage.
[03:19:59.380 --> 03:20:00.841]  But it starts before baby.
[03:20:00.841 --> 03:20:01.401]  Stay right there.
[03:20:01.401 --> 03:20:02.421]  We're coming back.
[03:20:02.421 --> 03:20:04.522]  This is an emergency alert.
[03:20:04.522 --> 03:20:10.384]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[03:20:10.384 --> 03:20:19.367]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[03:20:19.367 --> 03:20:21.268]  Rely on OxySilver instead.
[03:20:22.228 --> 03:20:28.092]  OxySilver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[03:20:28.092 --> 03:20:31.354]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[03:20:31.354 --> 03:20:33.735]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.
[03:20:33.735 --> 03:20:38.638]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[03:20:38.638 --> 03:20:42.380]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[03:20:42.380 --> 03:20:44.602]  So get it while you still can.
[03:20:44.602 --> 03:20:47.403]  Order OxySilver online at OxySilver.com.

[03:21:03.200 --> 03:21:07.224]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:07.224 --> 03:21:10.466]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:10.466 --> 03:21:15.290]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:21:15.290 --> 03:21:21.656]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.656 --> 03:21:23.898]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:21:24.438 --> 03:21:25.619]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:25.619 --> 03:21:26.579]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:26.579 --> 03:21:28.660]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:28.660 --> 03:21:30.161]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:30.161 --> 03:21:32.862]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:50.610 --> 03:21:59.728]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:22:01.789 --> 03:22:08.132]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[03:22:08.132 --> 03:22:13.075]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[03:22:13.075 --> 03:22:17.137]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[03:22:17.137 --> 03:22:18.477]  Let's put this another way.
[03:22:18.477 --> 03:22:22.719]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:26.741]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[03:22:26.741 --> 03:22:29.383]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[03:22:29.383 --> 03:22:31.103]  You can possess it in your hand.
[03:22:31.103 --> 03:22:32.364]  You can take it with you.
[03:22:32.364 --> 03:22:33.845]  Gold is real money.
[03:22:33.845 --> 03:22:35.205]  Gold is honest money.
[03:22:35.205 --> 03:22:37.927]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[03:22:37.927 --> 03:22:45.050]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious metal accounts, call me at 800-686-2237 extension 134.
[03:22:45.050 --> 03:22:45.250]  That's 800-686-2237
[03:23:02.358 --> 03:23:03.018]  Attention!
[03:23:03.018 --> 03:23:18.385]  An important product from hempusa.org, Micro Plant Powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[03:23:18.385 --> 03:23:19.805]  Micro Plant Powder is 89% silica,
[03:23:21.226 --> 03:23:21.586]  I think so.
[03:23:44.872 --> 03:23:45.232]  I think so.
[03:24:07.478 --> 03:24:09.520]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny is our guest in studio.
[03:24:09.520 --> 03:24:12.902]  A lot of ground to cover in a short time.
[03:24:12.902 --> 03:24:31.877]  Ukraine, you said at the start of the interview, and we got cut off by the break, that you're really concerned about what's happening over there, that they may be getting ready to release something else, they may have released something, that this huge build-up in and around a medical emergency is really perfect for the establishment, especially with the economic collapse, this global realignment, what's happening with the dollar.
[03:24:31.877 --> 03:24:32.498]  Please continue.
[03:24:33.072 --> 03:24:36.254]  I'm just concerned that there's another virus that's come into play.
[03:24:36.254 --> 03:24:46.622]  Because when you look at those numbers, if you can believe them at all, and there was a couple of really good sites that I looked at that looked at the numbers and how exponentially that there was more and more people getting sick in a very short period of time.
[03:24:46.622 --> 03:24:48.684]  I mean, was it something in the air?
[03:24:48.684 --> 03:24:49.985]  Was it something that was released?
[03:24:49.985 --> 03:24:54.688]  Was it one of these mutant viruses that we talked about in terms of Tamiflu, that now maybe the H1N1 and the
[03:24:55.729 --> 03:25:04.956]  And the H5N1 and maybe one of these mutant viruses has started to reassort and that there is really something a lot more virulent that's going on.
[03:25:04.956 --> 03:25:09.959]  Because with their supercomputers, they know how it's going to mutate in enough of a population.
[03:25:09.959 --> 03:25:14.142]  They admit that the nasal was live and could mutate and be spread.
[03:25:14.142 --> 03:25:16.344]  Why did they put out the first H1N1 vaccine nasal?
[03:25:18.570 --> 03:25:20.471]  Well, I think that was more for convenience.
[03:25:20.471 --> 03:25:25.613]  I think that that was kind of an easy thing to do, but it really does spread around in the population.
[03:25:25.613 --> 03:25:27.514]  What do we know about this virus in Ukraine?
[03:25:27.514 --> 03:25:28.515]  I mean, is it a flu virus?
[03:25:28.515 --> 03:25:29.135]  What is it?
[03:25:29.135 --> 03:25:30.035]  Nobody seems to know.
[03:25:30.035 --> 03:25:31.676]  They just say, oh, it's killing people.
[03:25:31.676 --> 03:25:32.256]  Exactly.
[03:25:32.256 --> 03:25:37.338]  And the World Health Organization sent a bunch of people down there that they ostensibly said, oh, it's just the H1N1 virus.
[03:25:37.338 --> 03:25:40.720]  It's just the novel one we've been talking about, nothing to be concerned about.
[03:25:40.720 --> 03:25:44.762]  But that is not the way that that virus has behaved over the course of the last eight months.
[03:25:45.182 --> 03:25:53.076]  You know, when we see the reports coming out of the Southern Hemisphere, we didn't have people that exponentially number of people getting sick in a very short period of time.
[03:25:53.076 --> 03:25:58.966]  So I think that there's something else that's happening there that I think there's still some missing pieces, but I'm sure it's a story that will evolve.
[03:25:59.349 --> 03:26:03.812]  Well, that's what happened in January as we had emergency managers in Indiana, New York.
[03:26:03.812 --> 03:26:10.697]  I got internal secret documents that were later confirmed in New York where they were telling cemeteries, get ready for millions dead.
[03:26:10.697 --> 03:26:14.259]  That was in January, March, January, February, March.
[03:26:14.259 --> 03:26:17.481]  And I went on air and I said, they're coming with some type of big flu hype.
[03:26:17.481 --> 03:26:19.122]  I don't know if it's going to be real.
[03:26:19.122 --> 03:26:23.125]  It may just be hype, but they're they're really building up like we've never seen.
[03:26:23.125 --> 03:26:26.387]  And we never saw flu pandemics coming this quickly.
[03:26:26.387 --> 03:26:29.089]  Now they're coming in shorter and shorter increments, aren't they?
[03:26:29.489 --> 03:26:33.872]  You know, Alex, I have a document on my computer that was from 2003 that was released.
[03:26:33.872 --> 03:26:47.380]  It was a small little report that came out from the CIA that actually said that they were very concerned that there was going to be the development of a virus down the road that could be activated by a second virus and that there would be no way.
[03:26:47.380 --> 03:26:49.441]  It was in a bioterrorism website.
[03:26:49.861 --> 03:26:53.266]  And they had no way of knowing and there would be no way to be able to control that.
[03:26:53.266 --> 03:27:00.194]  If there was a virus that had been released and then a second virus would activate it and it may be even activated by taking aspirin.
[03:27:00.194 --> 03:27:03.118]  I'll get you that report because it was just a small little report.
[03:27:03.118 --> 03:27:05.141]  I stumbled across it on my computer the other day.
[03:27:05.141 --> 03:27:07.564]  Why does aspirin activate so many things?
[03:27:08.004 --> 03:27:08.945]  I don't really know.
[03:27:08.945 --> 03:27:13.108]  I think it really has to do with the way that it interferes with the cytokine reactions.
[03:27:13.108 --> 03:27:18.311]  But it really has, it causes all sorts of reactions into the bloodstream.
[03:27:18.311 --> 03:27:23.415]  But you know this, that if aspirin was developed today, it would not be an over-the-counter drug.
[03:27:23.415 --> 03:27:27.258]  I mean, it would be a prescription because of how many different effects it has on the body.
[03:27:27.258 --> 03:27:28.519]  Some good, some bad.
[03:27:28.519 --> 03:27:29.859]  Some good, some bad.
[03:27:29.859 --> 03:27:30.400]  Mostly bad.
[03:27:31.954 --> 03:27:39.721]  Well that's incredible because they admit Tamiflu has all these bad reactions and is highly restricted in Japan.
[03:27:39.721 --> 03:27:50.170]  They're just giving it to everybody like it's candy and just like antibiotics make bacteria mutate quicker, I guess in a layman's terms that's what these antivirals do.
[03:27:50.490 --> 03:27:51.470]  Absolutely.
[03:27:51.470 --> 03:27:53.771]  And the World Health Organization talks about this.
[03:27:53.771 --> 03:28:05.794]  I mean, every month they come out with reports that there is now an H1N1 virus that has been identified in a particular country like South Vietnam or Thailand or China or places that it's resistant.
[03:28:05.794 --> 03:28:12.636]  They know that last year the H1N1 strain in the seasonal flu virus was 100% resistant to Tamiflu.
[03:28:12.636 --> 03:28:17.558]  Well, that had to have happened because we used a lot of Tamiflu previous to that.
[03:28:18.078 --> 03:28:19.359]  So it's going to happen.
[03:28:19.359 --> 03:28:23.580]  I mean, it has to happen that these viruses are going to mutate and morph around.
[03:28:23.580 --> 03:28:27.882]  You can't be fooling with Mother Nature like we do and not expect to have a bad outcome.
[03:28:27.882 --> 03:28:29.623]  Okay, I've been asking a lot of the questions.
[03:28:29.623 --> 03:28:35.325]  When we come back before we take calls, whatever you think is most important I'd like you to speak about and then also
[03:28:36.205 --> 03:28:43.489]  Again, the victory of the fact that people are waking up to this push for forced inoculation, you know, this huge brainwashing campaign.
[03:28:43.489 --> 03:28:44.990]  So that's positive.
[03:28:44.990 --> 03:28:52.274]  But also on the negative side, the fact that the government would try to push this globally and the UN is in control of the situation, that's scary.
[03:28:52.274 --> 03:28:53.475]  It's very scary.
[03:28:53.475 --> 03:28:54.736]  It's very frightening.
[03:28:54.736 --> 03:28:58.738]  And people really, you know, it's so good, Alex, that we're able to talk about things like this.
[03:28:58.738 --> 03:29:03.601]  It's so good that people are taking an active role and investigating for themselves and just saying no.
[03:29:04.361 --> 03:29:08.224]  I think all the people now that are willing to take flu shots, I mean, they're in the minority.
[03:29:08.224 --> 03:29:10.886]  We've got more people saying, no, I don't want this.
[03:29:10.886 --> 03:29:13.668]  There are other things I can do to keep myself healthy.
[03:29:13.668 --> 03:29:19.712]  I can do vitamin D, vitamin C, there's herbals, there's oregano oil, there's all sorts of things that are out there.
[03:29:19.712 --> 03:29:26.077]  Even simple things, getting plenty of sleep, you know, drinking good water, getting plenty of organic food as much as you can.
[03:29:26.077 --> 03:29:27.078]  There's all sorts of things.
[03:29:27.398 --> 03:29:28.078]  Okay, we got a break.
[03:29:28.078 --> 03:29:28.998]  We'll come right back.
[03:29:28.998 --> 03:29:29.659]  We're on the march.
[03:29:29.659 --> 03:29:30.299]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.247 --> 03:30:01.569]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.569 --> 03:30:06.870]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:11.392]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:11.392 --> 03:30:13.652]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.652 --> 03:30:15.293]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:15.293 --> 03:30:16.333]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.573 --> 03:30:24.998]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:30:24.998 --> 03:30:32.462]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[03:30:32.462 --> 03:30:38.486]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[03:30:38.486 --> 03:30:44.069]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[03:31:01.428 --> 03:31:10.593]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:31:10.593 --> 03:31:13.955]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:31:13.955 --> 03:31:19.818]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:31:19.818 --> 03:31:24.601]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:31:24.601 --> 03:31:26.962]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:31:27.142 --> 03:31:27.442]  Thank you.
[03:31:46.055 --> 03:31:49.760]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.

[03:32:00.673 --> 03:32:01.074]  Do it now!
[03:32:02.162 --> 03:32:06.705]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:32:06.705 --> 03:32:07.625]  Number one.
[03:32:07.625 --> 03:32:11.047]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:32:11.047 --> 03:32:11.907]  Number two.
[03:32:11.907 --> 03:32:16.790]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:17.550]  It's true.
[03:32:17.550 --> 03:32:22.093]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:32:22.413 --> 03:32:23.233]  Number 3.
[03:32:23.233 --> 03:32:26.814]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:32:26.814 --> 03:32:30.735]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:32:30.735 --> 03:32:31.535]  Number 4.
[03:32:31.535 --> 03:32:34.295]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:32:34.295 --> 03:32:37.976]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:32:37.976 --> 03:32:38.756]  Number 5.
[03:32:38.756 --> 03:32:42.897]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:32:42.897 --> 03:32:47.658]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:32:47.958 --> 03:32:52.119]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:52.119 --> 03:32:53.920]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:53.920 --> 03:32:56.161]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:32:56.161 --> 03:32:58.041]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:32:58.041 --> 03:32:58.821]  Come, you masters of war.
[03:33:11.279 --> 03:33:13.582]  We're launching something new.
[03:33:13.582 --> 03:33:20.412]  Several times during the radio show every day, we're going to come back into segments playing one-minute comments from listeners.
[03:33:20.412 --> 03:33:22.394]  Questions, comments, you agree, you disagree.
[03:33:23.773 --> 03:33:26.934]  Just make it short and sweet and focused and we're going to air the good ones.
[03:33:26.934 --> 03:33:30.474]  The comment line is 512-646-4444.
[03:33:30.474 --> 03:33:31.155]  512-646-4444.
[03:33:31.155 --> 03:33:36.516]  And you'll start hearing these tomorrow on air.
[03:33:36.516 --> 03:33:36.896]  512-646-4444.
[03:33:36.896 --> 03:33:42.497]  A lot of other shows do this.
[03:33:42.497 --> 03:33:43.717]  I've done this many years ago.
[03:33:43.717 --> 03:33:46.598]  We're going to bring this back to the show.
[03:33:46.598 --> 03:33:50.558]  Continuing here, I want to tell you about a few sponsors that have made today's broadcast possible.
[03:33:50.558 --> 03:33:52.879]  We're going to hit a few final key points with Dr. Sherri Tenpenny.
[03:33:53.499 --> 03:33:55.779]  Tell you about some of the books and materials she has available.
[03:33:55.779 --> 03:34:00.000]  Rob Dew's idea for her to put out a line of t-shirts to educate folks.
[03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:00.440]  They've done it.
[03:34:00.440 --> 03:34:01.221]  They're very handsome.
[03:34:01.221 --> 03:34:01.881]  She brought me some.
[03:34:01.881 --> 03:34:02.581]  We'll show you those.
[03:34:02.581 --> 03:34:05.582]  I want to support the work she's doing so she can do this full-time.
[03:34:05.582 --> 03:34:11.563]  As she says, there's money-making work, being a doctor, and then her own money flying all over the country trying to educate people.
[03:34:11.563 --> 03:34:16.764]  She's a wonderful lady, so we want to financially support her and our sponsors that financially support us.
[03:34:17.364 --> 03:34:19.225]  One of them is DigiNet.net.
[03:34:19.225 --> 03:34:21.426]  You get 10% off the DigiNet pins.
[03:34:21.426 --> 03:34:21.986]  It's a little pin.

[03:36:16.153 --> 03:36:22.978]  And again, I want to thank all those great sponsors for making today's show possible.
[03:36:22.978 --> 03:36:26.240]  Before we go any further, Sherry, with my last few questions before we take some calls,
[03:36:26.880 --> 03:36:33.142]  Tell folks again about your multiple websites that have all this great information on them, and the book that we carry, incidentally.
[03:36:33.142 --> 03:36:48.587]  You can also get it at her sites, Fowl, revised and updated, dealing with what's happening now, breaking down, exposing the hidden agenda, the agribusiness drug company connection, the role of the environment in making the birds sick, and what was really behind the 1918 pandemic.
[03:36:48.587 --> 03:36:51.508]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, Fowl, a bestseller.
[03:36:51.508 --> 03:36:51.768]  Doctor?
[03:36:52.386 --> 03:37:04.108]  Well, thank you Alex for talking about that because that book was written in 2006 and one of the main things, even though the title of the book talks about bird flu, it really is a playbook of exactly what's going on now.
[03:37:04.108 --> 03:37:14.810]  So if you want to know about the specifics about Tamiflu, how the vaccines are made, the cell line technologies, the eggs, all of those different things, it's all in that book and all of the backdrop in terms of the politics.
[03:37:14.810 --> 03:37:17.231]  There's a whole chapter on mandatory vaccination and so
[03:37:17.751 --> 03:37:22.752]  It's very timely information even though it was published at the time that the bird flu was coming out.
[03:37:22.752 --> 03:37:24.072]  It's really, really timely.
[03:37:24.072 --> 03:37:29.653]  Then the other book is Saying No to Vaccines and it's a resource guide for all ages.
[03:37:29.653 --> 03:37:34.234]  It's refuting the 25 most common reasons people think you should vaccinate.
[03:37:34.234 --> 03:37:37.175]  So you can just scan down the table of contents.
[03:37:37.175 --> 03:37:45.657]  You can look at a particular question and you can go to that page and just read it and then there's a footnoted reference right there that you can print out and hand to anybody that you want.
[03:37:45.657 --> 03:37:46.757]  And there's nobody out there
[03:37:47.754 --> 03:37:56.339]  As focused and professional as Dr. Sherry Tenpenny when it comes to exposing these frauds, these scams, these new world order operations, it's just wonderful.
[03:37:56.339 --> 03:38:02.723]  We were talking during the break with emails pouring in about people's husbands, their wives, dying, having heart attacks right after the shot.
[03:38:03.403 --> 03:38:16.120]  And Reuters a month ago, who by the way are involved in some of the companies, some of the owners of Reuters are involved in some of the vaccine makers, they put out a headline saying millions will die of heart attacks and autoimmune disorders and being paralyzed.
[03:38:16.120 --> 03:38:19.485]  That happens normally just because you think the shot did it.
[03:38:19.485 --> 03:38:20.246]  We are mass
[03:38:21.927 --> 03:38:23.688]  Diagnosing all of you.
[03:38:23.688 --> 03:38:27.532]  None of this happened from the vaccines, even though their own inserts admit it.
[03:38:27.532 --> 03:38:37.420]  I remember, and you wrote about this, but the mainstream media had to later admit it when Tommy Thompson, head of Health and Human Services, he wouldn't even take it when all these people taking it were having heart attacks.
[03:38:37.420 --> 03:38:41.443]  And now we're seeing similar reports with this happening with the flu shot.
[03:38:41.443 --> 03:38:42.544]  Why is this happening?
[03:38:43.134 --> 03:38:53.745]  Well, the live flu vaccines, particularly the swine flu vaccine, when we talked about doing that after 9-11 and they've done it to the military, they were going to do it to first responders, all the health care workers.
[03:38:53.745 --> 03:38:58.130]  Well, the smallpox vaccine was injecting a live virus.
[03:38:58.130 --> 03:39:03.516]  That live virus was actually shown to cause hypercoagulability, which means it makes your blood clot.
[03:39:04.116 --> 03:39:08.800]  And people were dying from blood clots to the lungs, blood clots to the heart, and heart attacks.
[03:39:08.800 --> 03:39:15.946]  Well, this Flumas vaccine, and the one that goes up the nose, is a live flu, it's a live virus.
[03:39:15.946 --> 03:39:18.347]  It's a weakened virus, but it's a live virus.
[03:39:18.347 --> 03:39:21.250]  Injecting all of these flu shots into the body can do that.
[03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:25.392]  And I really think that there's a lot of information that's going to be coming out.
[03:39:25.392 --> 03:39:27.733]  It's the new ploy that the vaccine industry is doing.
[03:39:27.733 --> 03:39:31.175]  I mean, first they used to say you had to vaccinate so you wouldn't get sick.
[03:39:31.175 --> 03:39:35.938]  And then they said, well, you've got to get vaccinated so you can protect everybody around you.
[03:39:35.938 --> 03:39:39.220]  And then they said, no, you've got to get vaccinated so that it will save money.
[03:39:39.220 --> 03:39:42.362]  So if you get vaccinated and you don't get sick, we won't have to put you in the hospital.
[03:39:42.822 --> 03:39:45.785]  And now they're saying, well, we know all these vaccine reactions are going to happen.
[03:39:45.785 --> 03:39:51.450]  So we're going to look at populations and find out what the baseline incidence is of having things like Guillain-Barre and heart attacks.
[03:39:51.450 --> 03:39:58.417]  And so when we start having flu vaccines that happen and people are getting sick from them, well, we've already got the statistics to say that can't be the flu shot.
[03:39:58.417 --> 03:40:00.038]  It has to be something else.
[03:40:00.038 --> 03:40:03.602]  So it's anything in the world to vaccinate everybody with everything.
[03:40:04.602 --> 03:40:06.123]  We've got every microbe out there.
[03:40:06.123 --> 03:40:12.889]  You know, I always tell people, it's like, if you're living in your house and you have animals, I mean, how many bugs do you think are crawling around in your living room floor?
[03:40:12.889 --> 03:40:15.891]  Do you have dogs or cats or horses or guinea pigs?
[03:40:15.891 --> 03:40:16.932]  Or you go to the playground?
[03:40:16.932 --> 03:40:20.134]  Are you sitting in a, in a, like the conference that we had last night?
[03:40:20.134 --> 03:40:23.737]  The only bugs that we seem to have much concern about are the ones we have vaccines for.
[03:40:23.737 --> 03:40:27.400]  And if you don't have a vaccine for it, then I guess your body does a pretty good job keeping you
[03:40:27.500 --> 03:40:29.463]  And they've got hundreds of vaccines in the pipe.
[03:40:29.463 --> 03:40:32.687]  They've gone from a dozen to 30 to 40 to 50 to 60.
[03:40:32.687 --> 03:40:34.489]  They want to force us to take.
[03:40:34.489 --> 03:40:36.873]  This is an amazing business plan.
[03:40:36.873 --> 03:40:38.975]  Big Pharma comes, lobbies government.
[03:40:38.975 --> 03:40:43.421]  They shove it on you, force it on kids, any captive population, force it on prisoners.
[03:40:44.082 --> 03:40:45.343]  I mean, this is a great business.
[03:40:45.343 --> 03:40:56.670]  Yeah, and there was a report that just came out a couple of days ago that they said by 2014, that's just a couple years away, by 2014, there will be 75 more vaccines that will be all ready to go.
[03:40:56.670 --> 03:40:58.312]  75.
[03:40:58.312 --> 03:41:05.076]  And they're for things like addiction and stop smoking and obesity and all these different... Oh, by the way, I've had scientists on about that.
[03:41:05.076 --> 03:41:10.800]  Some of these anti-drug vaccines where you won't want cigarettes, you won't want cocaine, you won't want opium.
[03:41:11.580 --> 03:41:15.361]  Opiate-type drugs, you know, the painkillers.
[03:41:15.361 --> 03:41:22.443]  They admit that it's a virus that goes in and actually attacks some of the receptors and gives you a type of lobotomy.
[03:41:22.443 --> 03:41:28.584]  And then they have others that attack the chemical reaction in the body, and it creates plaques in the brains.
[03:41:28.584 --> 03:41:34.986]  I mean, my God, these new systems I don't even think should be called, and many scientists have said on this show, shouldn't be called vaccines.
[03:41:35.706 --> 03:41:37.647]  These are almost like nanobots.
[03:41:37.647 --> 03:41:40.268]  These are almost like nanotech.
[03:41:40.268 --> 03:41:46.250]  You know, the incredible voyage going in and actually rewiring the brain.
[03:41:46.250 --> 03:42:00.235]  And a lot of scientists have said, if this keeps you from being able to absorb opiates or nicotine or other drugs, all of those opiates and all of those chemicals, they're mimicking different endorphins, different normal chemicals in the brain.
[03:42:00.235 --> 03:42:00.875]  Dr. Blaylock,
[03:42:01.055 --> 03:42:03.476]  Top brain scientists have talked about this here.
[03:42:03.476 --> 03:42:05.596]  And I mean, so now they're setting the precedent.
[03:42:05.596 --> 03:42:06.536]  I was watching G.I.
[03:42:06.536 --> 03:42:10.837]  Joe, you know, the kids movie the other day on the treadmill, and it was all pro-war propaganda.
[03:42:10.837 --> 03:42:15.939]  But the evil Cobra Commander is injecting people with nanobots that make them their slaves.
[03:42:15.939 --> 03:42:18.719]  Well, that's basically what they're talking about now.
[03:42:18.719 --> 03:42:23.020]  I mean, my God, you're going to take something where you can't even absorb your regular endorphins?
[03:42:23.020 --> 03:42:25.141]  But don't worry, we'll have a drug that replaces that.
[03:42:26.010 --> 03:42:32.997]  Yeah, it's like all that humans have become is a repository for the products of the pharmaceutical industry.
[03:42:32.997 --> 03:42:38.963]  Whether that product is a vaccine or a drug or some other type of chemical, we are a repository for that.
[03:42:38.963 --> 03:42:48.633]  And how much more can we actually keep putting in and putting in and putting in before we have just... It's one big bio-experiment that breaks everybody's health down and we just can't live.
[03:42:48.633 --> 03:42:49.854]  We just can't survive that.
[03:42:51.414 --> 03:43:12.394]  Well, I mean, you've done all this research, and so have major universities, that we are seeing a massive increase in allergies because the vaccines cause an autoimmune response, and it causes all sorts of interactions because of the RNA, the fungus, things that get into the vaccine preparation, and so your body's just fighting, fighting, and starts having responses to everything.
[03:43:12.634 --> 03:43:16.217]  Yeah, and they create things like some of the additives like gelatin.
[03:43:16.217 --> 03:43:23.503]  They know for sure that gelatin that is in some of the flu shots and in the chickenpox vaccine causes allergies and allergic reactions.
[03:43:23.503 --> 03:43:27.607]  They know polysorbate 80 causes allergic reactions and it also can cause anaphylaxis.
[03:43:28.027 --> 03:43:35.556]  It can cause infertility in female mice and that additive is in the DPT vaccine and it's in the new Gardasil vaccine.
[03:43:35.556 --> 03:43:46.470]  It's just one big scientific, it's like a big test tube, experimental vaccination petri dish and it's as though they can just put more and more and more in us and that seems to be okay.
[03:43:46.630 --> 03:43:58.497]  Well, what about hundreds of peer-reviewed major studies showing that all the different rodents they give vaccines to, different types, develop early onset of unnatural arthritis?
[03:43:58.497 --> 03:44:02.940]  I mean, the reports about people having heart attacks, how does that happen?
[03:44:02.940 --> 03:44:07.163]  I mean, speak about the arthritis and then the cardiovascular problems.
[03:44:07.443 --> 03:44:10.865]  Well, it's really about, there's a bunch of different things.
[03:44:10.865 --> 03:44:12.366]  I like to use the analogy, Alex.
[03:44:12.366 --> 03:44:23.834]  It's sort of like, if you take a little mini-bomb, like a little cherry bomb out in your backyard, and you put it underneath a pile of leaves, and you set it off, and then the leaves go boof, and fly up all over the place.
[03:44:23.834 --> 03:44:35.081]  That's kind of what happens when you put a vaccine into your immune system, and into all of these cytokine pathways, and how they all talk to each other, just like it blows them up, and causes everything to go into a disarray.
[03:44:35.081 --> 03:44:36.982]  We can't keep doing this with impunity.
[03:44:37.142 --> 03:44:37.802]  We just can't.
[03:44:37.802 --> 03:44:45.585]  Because our body's meant to have small amounts of things they beat, not injected directly into it a whole witch's brew of venom.
[03:44:45.585 --> 03:44:57.050]  The new mantra and the new argument in the vaccine world, particularly about mercury, is when they say that you can get more mercury out of eating a can of tuna fish than you can from getting an injection in the vaccine.
[03:44:57.050 --> 03:44:59.771]  That's their new little soundbite to try to dismiss all of this.
[03:44:59.771 --> 03:45:04.913]  And we got the CFR clip where they said, we're going to use this, and we're going to say there's a shortage.
[03:45:04.913 --> 03:45:05.353]  Exactly.
[03:45:05.353 --> 03:45:06.954]  And they laugh about it, manipulate it.
[03:45:07.574 --> 03:45:08.755]  Yeah, they do.
[03:45:08.755 --> 03:45:12.676]  And it's the differences between ingesting and injecting.
[03:45:12.676 --> 03:45:17.558]  You can ingest a little bit of mercury in a tuna fish and more than likely it's going to go out in your stool.
[03:45:17.558 --> 03:45:22.000]  You inject that into your body, it will eventually get absorbed and go into your brain.
[03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:31.284]  You can ingest fish oils and you can ingest oils like shark oil, but you inject shark oil, which is what the squalene adjuvant is, and it's a completely different ballgame.
[03:45:32.734 --> 03:45:41.648]  And I've read the medical literature, but they describe how mercury bound to food, 99% of it goes out, but injected it goes right over the blood-brain barrier.
[03:45:41.648 --> 03:45:42.069]  Exactly.
[03:45:42.069 --> 03:45:46.336]  And children, am I correct doctor, for the first few years don't have that blood-brain barrier properly.
[03:45:46.798 --> 03:45:50.161]  Well, they do have a blood-brain barrier, but I think it's a little bit leakier.
[03:45:50.161 --> 03:45:53.364]  I mean, they don't have it quite as... it's leakier.
[03:45:53.364 --> 03:45:56.627]  So, the possibility of things going across the blood-brain barrier is higher.
[03:45:56.627 --> 03:46:01.531]  And with the new FluMist vaccine, the one that goes up the nose, that has MSG in it.
[03:46:01.531 --> 03:46:07.937]  So, MSG, which is an acytotoxin in the brain, which can go right up the olfactory nose and right into the brain tissue.
[03:46:07.937 --> 03:46:13.762]  What I'm wanting to know is who's going to follow the brain reactions that could possibly happen down the road from injecting
[03:46:14.623 --> 03:46:16.925]  Big wad of viruses and MSG right up the nose.
[03:46:16.925 --> 03:46:20.629]  But the medical system has an incentive to cover all this up.
[03:46:20.629 --> 03:46:23.571]  I mean, even the doctors who are giving the shots, they want to be in denial.
[03:46:23.571 --> 03:46:24.753]  They don't want to admit they're part of.
[03:46:25.578 --> 03:46:28.140]  No, and they've got liability protection too.
[03:46:28.140 --> 03:46:30.481]  I mean, it's anybody that's involved down line from that.
[03:46:30.481 --> 03:46:35.324]  They all have liability protection for anything that may be going on with the vaccines.
[03:46:35.324 --> 03:46:37.085]  Okay, I want to take calls now.
[03:46:37.085 --> 03:46:38.666]  Please have a quick question or comment.
[03:46:38.666 --> 03:46:43.209]  I'm sure we'll probably have horror stories of people being paralyzed or killed that are flooding in.
[03:46:43.209 --> 03:46:45.950]  But Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air with Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[03:46:45.950 --> 03:46:47.191]  Thanks for calling.
[03:46:47.191 --> 03:46:47.731]  Thanks, sir.
[03:46:47.731 --> 03:46:49.092]  Thanks for the great debate last night.
[03:46:49.092 --> 03:46:49.893]  And as a follow-up to
[03:46:50.811 --> 03:46:52.532]  Yes, yes Ronnie, I appreciate your call.
[03:46:52.532 --> 03:46:55.694]  We've got to get on the offensive against this whole system and he made me think of something.
[03:46:55.694 --> 03:47:03.239]  He just brought up the fact, because I talked to you off air, you said the majority of people were on your side at the event and the undecideds that they woke up by the end of it.
[03:47:20.270 --> 03:47:28.575]  Yeah, I thought that the people that were there last night, that the vast majority of them, they were from the libertarians and they were really on the health freedom side of the equation.
[03:47:28.575 --> 03:47:33.898]  And I think that they were more supportive of vaccine information and vaccine freedom of choice.
[03:47:33.898 --> 03:47:43.064]  And I think that the neutral parties that were there by the time that they were left and they saw the good arguments that we had backed up by sound, decisive things that we said versus kind of the
[03:47:44.104 --> 03:47:48.785]  I would say lame discussions that happened from the health department in the same old status quo.
[03:47:48.785 --> 03:47:52.766]  I think that a lot of people left very enlightened by the information they got last night.
[03:47:52.766 --> 03:47:59.127]  By the way, we're going to take that video conference and post it at PrisonPlanet.tv for the folks over there, and then it'll get ripped everywhere else.
[03:47:59.127 --> 03:47:59.927]  That's great.
[03:47:59.927 --> 03:48:02.628]  Jeff in Missouri, do you have a question for our guest?
[03:48:02.628 --> 03:48:03.568]  Yes, I do.
[03:48:03.568 --> 03:48:07.189]  Dr. Tenpenny, I know you're not a veterinarian, but I was wondering if you knew anything about
[03:48:08.512 --> 03:48:11.674]  The H3N8 dog virus.
[03:48:11.674 --> 03:48:12.775]  I really don't.
[03:48:12.775 --> 03:48:19.239]  You know, there's so much information that needs to be handled and read and assimilated every day from the human side.
[03:48:19.239 --> 03:48:22.262]  I really haven't gotten involved with the animals at all.
[03:48:22.262 --> 03:48:24.804]  I work for a large animal vet and a small animal vet.
[03:48:25.464 --> 03:48:26.965]  This was 20 years ago.
[03:48:26.965 --> 03:48:30.407]  And I remember them advising people, look, they say give the shot every year.
[03:48:30.407 --> 03:48:31.228]  It's not good.
[03:48:31.228 --> 03:48:32.409]  It can hurt your dog.
[03:48:32.409 --> 03:48:34.330]  Now they're not saying give them every year.
[03:48:34.330 --> 03:48:37.552]  The vaccine makers just went and paid off the veterinarian society.
[03:48:37.552 --> 03:48:41.214]  And a lot of major veterinary groups are coming out and saying these vaccines are killing people's dogs.
[03:48:41.214 --> 03:48:41.975]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:48:42.535 --> 03:48:44.636]  So again, we're marching on every front.
[03:48:44.636 --> 03:48:45.576]  The truth's coming out.
[03:48:45.576 --> 03:48:54.078]  And I think this whole vaccine scare, this whole push for bird flu and swine flu, was really an attempt for them to get back control of the situation.
[03:48:54.078 --> 03:48:57.559]  But I think, like Judo, we took them on and slammed them through the wall.
[03:48:57.559 --> 03:48:58.739]  You agree we're kicking their butt?
[03:48:58.739 --> 03:49:00.199]  I think that was really good.
[03:49:00.199 --> 03:49:01.660]  Yeah, it was.
[03:49:01.660 --> 03:49:02.480]  That was good.
[03:49:02.480 --> 03:49:04.981]  Well, hey, we're discovering our fighting spirit.
[03:49:04.981 --> 03:49:05.941]  Thank you, Jeff.
[03:49:05.941 --> 03:49:07.521]  I'm going quick because I want everybody to get on.
[03:49:07.521 --> 03:49:08.322]  Jim in New York.
[03:49:08.322 --> 03:49:09.702]  You're on the air with Dr. Sherri Tenpenny.
[03:49:09.702 --> 03:49:09.842]  Go!
[03:49:11.823 --> 03:49:16.364]  I talked with the husband of a scientist who works at the Cold Spring Lab.
[03:49:16.364 --> 03:49:17.624]  They've been together for a long time.
[03:49:17.624 --> 03:49:19.745]  They actually live there at Cold Spring.
[03:49:19.745 --> 03:49:24.305]  Cold Springs is the eugenics, IBM, bioweapons area, yes.
[03:49:24.305 --> 03:49:24.986]  That's right.
[03:49:24.986 --> 03:49:27.986]  Yeah, she's actually doing research into autism, though.
[03:49:27.986 --> 03:49:34.347]  And when I had this conversation, I said, oh, so she's probably linked up with vaccines that cause this.
[03:49:34.347 --> 03:49:36.188]  And that changed his whole demeanor.
[03:49:36.188 --> 03:49:38.108]  He flat out came out and said,
[03:49:38.584 --> 03:49:40.027]  That is a complete fraud.
[03:49:40.027 --> 03:49:43.452]  There's absolutely no link.
[03:49:43.452 --> 03:49:49.903]  And the theory that they have at Cold Spring, which is what they're trying to prove, is that because men are having
[03:49:52.755 --> 03:49:55.197]  Yes, I've seen those studies.
[03:49:55.197 --> 03:49:56.879]  See, they're eugenicists at Cold Springs.
[03:49:56.879 --> 03:49:57.719]  That's where it was founded.
[03:49:57.719 --> 03:50:00.361]  Hitler got all his plans from Cold Springs, as you know, Doctor.
[03:50:00.361 --> 03:50:01.402]  That's what Endgame covers.
[03:50:01.402 --> 03:50:02.963]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:50:02.963 --> 03:50:09.649]  They're saying, oh, we all have bad genetics, and so we need to pass laws to test your genes to see if you can have kids.
[03:50:10.697 --> 03:50:10.977]  Yeah.
[03:50:10.977 --> 03:50:18.903]  And it's true from the studies that boys get it more, from what I've seen, because the mercury genetically passes through to the brain at a higher level.
[03:50:18.903 --> 03:50:19.523]  That's what I've read.
[03:50:19.523 --> 03:50:19.963]  Is that?
[03:50:19.963 --> 03:50:23.766]  Well, some of it has to do, they think, it has to do with the testosterone levels.
[03:50:23.766 --> 03:50:29.270]  And they think that the higher testosterone has a worse of a problem with the mercury on the brain.
[03:50:29.850 --> 03:50:32.451]  So see, there's a little bit of truth there, but it's, yeah.
[03:50:32.451 --> 03:50:43.253]  But I think that what's really interesting is that when they did the whole Human Genome Project, and they're looking at genes, is what they don't understand is that the gene pool is fluid, and something has to push those genes.
[03:50:43.253 --> 03:50:48.094]  It could be a chemical environment, a vaccine, a toxin, and it's not going to be the same for every person.
[03:50:48.094 --> 03:50:52.095]  Well, the director of Cold Springs had to resign last year for saying blacks weren't human.
[03:50:52.095 --> 03:50:56.136]  Before that was even in the news, I named him as a top eugenicist.
[03:50:56.136 --> 03:50:59.237]  Dr. Watson, in Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:51:06.656 --> 03:51:09.878]  Times are tough, and many of us expect them to get worse.
[03:51:09.878 --> 03:51:13.059]  The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[03:51:13.059 --> 03:51:16.021]  Therefore, you have no excuse not to be prepared.
[03:51:16.021 --> 03:51:22.464]  If another Great Depression starts America, how will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones?
[03:51:22.464 --> 03:51:25.986]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food.
[03:51:25.986 --> 03:51:27.787]  Patriotfood.com is different.
[03:51:28.206 --> 03:51:32.511]  Because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[03:51:32.511 --> 03:51:39.620]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty, food-grade plastic bags that will last 10 years.
[03:51:39.620 --> 03:51:42.364]  While our competition charges $3,000, we ship to you 135 pounds
[03:51:46.068 --> 03:51:48.790]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:51.012]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:51:51.012 --> 03:51:53.054]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.890 --> 03:52:15.933]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.933 --> 03:52:21.959]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.959 --> 03:52:27.324]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:27.324 --> 03:52:37.153]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:37.253 --> 03:52:39.594]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.594 --> 03:52:41.175]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:41.175 --> 03:52:43.637]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.637 --> 03:52:45.778]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.778 --> 03:52:50.922]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.922 --> 03:53:00.047]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:02.122 --> 03:53:06.606]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[03:53:06.606 --> 03:53:10.890]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[03:53:10.890 --> 03:53:21.739]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[03:53:21.739 --> 03:53:24.241]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful immune
[03:53:24.241 --> 03:53:24.561]  Let's do it!

[03:54:13.894 --> 03:54:18.636]  I'm going to talk to Jessica, Tim, and Larry with quick questions here in just a moment.
[03:54:18.636 --> 03:54:24.498]  But Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, Do, Rob Do a couple months ago was up there interviewing her for Fall of the Republic 2.
[03:54:24.498 --> 03:54:28.020]  And he said, you want to come out with t-shirts to fund your operation, plus get the word out.
[03:54:28.020 --> 03:54:29.640]  And she brought me a bunch of them.
[03:54:29.640 --> 03:54:30.981]  They're really good looking shirts.
[03:54:32.121 --> 03:54:32.922]  I don't think so.
[03:54:50.215 --> 03:54:50.836]  Required.
[03:54:50.836 --> 03:54:51.276]  No.
[03:54:51.276 --> 03:54:53.138]  We're saying no to those.
[03:54:53.138 --> 03:54:54.999]  DrTinPenny.com on the back.
[03:54:54.999 --> 03:54:58.682]  Don't Inject Me is on the back.
[03:54:58.682 --> 03:55:01.865]  Go to DrTinPenny.com and get those and get all our t-shirts.
[03:55:01.865 --> 03:55:04.047]  Like the Gadsden flag, you name it.
[03:55:04.047 --> 03:55:05.308]  At Info Wars.
[03:55:06.688 --> 03:55:09.410]  Because this is walking billboards for the truth.
[03:55:09.410 --> 03:55:12.892]  We've got to bypass the mainstream media and get the job done.
[03:55:12.892 --> 03:55:13.792]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:55:13.792 --> 03:55:20.295]  Doc, that's a good idea and I'm glad you took our advice on that because we all need to fund ourselves to build a bigger platform.
[03:55:20.295 --> 03:55:22.196]  We don't have George Soros funding us.
[03:55:22.196 --> 03:55:24.117]  Jessica in Michigan, you're on the air.
[03:55:24.117 --> 03:55:24.938]  Jessica, go ahead.
[03:55:24.938 --> 03:55:33.142]  Hi, I work at a large hospital here in Grand Rapids and they have made the flu vaccine mandatory this year for the first time.
[03:55:33.935 --> 03:55:39.298]  And I am religiously opposed to that and I've made that clear to everybody there pretty much.
[03:55:39.298 --> 03:55:57.627]  So this morning Human Resources approached me after work and they told me that they have set up an appointment for me to meet with a board and I have 15 minutes to plead my case to them as to why I should be exempt from the vaccine and currently they're only allowing medical exemption and so
[03:55:58.805 --> 03:56:02.697]  Well, say you have an allergy.
[03:56:02.697 --> 03:56:05.165]  But why have a job if you have to take the shot?
[03:56:06.212 --> 03:56:13.018]  You have to sign a paper giving full access to all of your medical records, and then they have a committee that reviews that.
[03:56:13.018 --> 03:56:14.219]  Ma'am, this is tyranny.
[03:56:14.219 --> 03:56:15.320]  This is just tyranny.
[03:56:15.320 --> 03:56:17.121]  I totally agree.
[03:56:17.121 --> 03:56:18.282]  What should she do, doctor?
[03:56:18.282 --> 03:56:22.246]  Well, one of the most important things you can do is to try to find some like-minded people.
[03:56:22.246 --> 03:56:30.913]  Find some other people that you can band together with and go collectively as a group, because I am sure that in the place where you work, that there are other people who want to refuse this vaccine.
[03:56:30.933 --> 03:56:32.173]  Yes, you're isolated.
[03:56:32.173 --> 03:56:33.313]  They want to corner you.
[03:56:33.313 --> 03:56:37.114]  That's why they're forcibly inoculating only elementary kids.
[03:56:37.114 --> 03:56:39.355]  Because they know they're defenseless.
[03:56:39.355 --> 03:56:39.815]  Exactly.
[03:56:39.815 --> 03:56:45.976]  And if you can find some like-minded people, there's already a nursing shortage that can't fire or suspend all of you.
[03:56:45.976 --> 03:56:48.177]  So you really need to get together collectively.
[03:56:48.177 --> 03:56:54.158]  And you tell them it's a religious discrimination and that you may have to sue them and they'll back off.
[03:56:54.158 --> 03:56:54.698]  Yeah.
[03:56:54.698 --> 03:56:56.678]  Decide it's against your religion today.
[03:56:56.678 --> 03:56:59.879]  I think that people are going to need to be that strong and stand up for that.
[03:57:00.444 --> 03:57:07.325]  Well, look, they stood up in England, they stood up in Germany, they ordered the doctors to fine people that didn't do it.
[03:57:07.325 --> 03:57:09.766]  If they didn't take the shot, the doctors said, we'll just quit.
[03:57:09.766 --> 03:57:10.966]  We've got to learn to say no.
[03:57:10.966 --> 03:57:12.927]  They tried to put GMO food in France.
[03:57:12.927 --> 03:57:14.627]  The farmers went crazy.
[03:57:14.627 --> 03:57:16.828]  We've got to grow a backbone like Americans used to.
[03:57:16.828 --> 03:57:18.588]  Ma'am, I'm sorry to hear that's happening to you.
[03:57:18.588 --> 03:57:19.708]  Tim in Ohio.
[03:57:19.708 --> 03:57:21.088]  You're on the air with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[03:57:21.088 --> 03:57:22.309]  Go ahead.
[03:57:22.309 --> 03:57:22.749]  Hi, Alex.
[03:57:22.749 --> 03:57:23.549]  Hello, Dr. Tenpenny.
[03:57:23.908 --> 03:57:24.869]  Good afternoon.
[03:57:24.869 --> 03:57:28.030]  I'm right next door to you when you're at home in Lorain County.
[03:57:28.030 --> 03:57:29.711]  Alex, I missed the message with your video, guys.
[03:57:29.711 --> 03:57:31.672]  I could've copped you that interview.
[03:57:31.672 --> 03:57:33.513]  I got all the cameras and all the production equipment.
[03:57:33.513 --> 03:57:33.753]  Okay, great.
[03:57:33.753 --> 03:57:34.774]  You have a question for her, Tim.
[03:57:34.774 --> 03:57:35.654]  We're almost out of time.
[03:57:35.654 --> 03:57:43.078]  Yes, Dr. Tenpenny, I noticed on the local stations, Monica Raffens, Stephanie Schaefer, Lee Jordan, Alicia Booth, Dawn Kendrick, none of them will have you on.
[03:57:43.078 --> 03:57:43.298]  Why?
[03:57:44.171 --> 03:57:45.172]  That's pretty interesting.
[03:57:45.172 --> 03:57:47.913]  It's sort of like you're never a prophet in your own town, are you?
[03:57:47.913 --> 03:57:57.620]  But I was on Mike Trevisano a couple of weeks ago on 1100 AM and I was supposed to be on last Thursday but got preempted by the military base thing that happened.
[03:57:57.620 --> 03:57:58.640]  Tim, thank you.
[03:57:58.640 --> 03:58:00.121]  Larry, 10 second question.
[03:58:00.121 --> 03:58:00.761]  Hit us.
[03:58:00.761 --> 03:58:02.823]  Larry in Minnesota.
[03:58:02.823 --> 03:58:03.763]  Hi Alex, hi Sherry.
[03:58:05.592 --> 03:58:12.695]  I'm a desert storm vet and a healthcare worker and in a similar position as the girl that just called us just a minute ago.
[03:58:12.695 --> 03:58:13.376]  The goal is 100%.
[03:58:13.376 --> 03:58:17.157]  Any comments about herd immunity and can I get my website out?
[03:58:17.157 --> 03:58:18.078]  I'm a healthcare worker.
[03:58:18.078 --> 03:58:19.138]  I want to get this information.
[03:58:19.138 --> 03:58:22.020]  But Obama says nobody has to take it.
[03:58:22.020 --> 03:58:22.720]  Give your website out.
[03:58:23.689 --> 03:58:26.090]  HealthCareTyranny.com in the Twin Cities, Minnesota.
[03:58:26.090 --> 03:58:26.590]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:27.631]  Alright, God bless you.
[03:58:27.631 --> 03:58:32.153]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, DrSherryTinpenny.com or DrTinpenny.com.
[03:58:32.153 --> 03:58:33.713]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:58:33.713 --> 03:58:34.394]  You're welcome.
[03:58:34.394 --> 03:58:34.954]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:58:34.954 --> 03:58:39.476]  You are a trooper, a warrior, an Amazon princess in the fight against tyranny.
[03:58:39.476 --> 03:58:40.896]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:40.896 --> 03:58:42.417]  KeyInfo at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:42.417 --> 03:58:43.897]  Great job.
[03:58:43.897 --> 03:58:47.399]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:47.399 --> 03:58:49.700]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.755 --> 03:58:55.137]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:55.137 --> 03:58:58.759]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.759 --> 03:59:03.341]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:03.341 --> 03:59:08.924]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:09.224 --> 03:59:13.988]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.988 --> 03:59:17.610]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.610 --> 03:59:22.434]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:22.434 --> 03:59:28.998]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.998 --> 03:59:30.940]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:31.420 --> 03:59:33.581]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
