[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:01.710]  War on Corruption.
[00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:05.093]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:12.158]  Big Brother.
[00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:13.899]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:15.680]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:17.161]  You want answers?
[00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:18.822]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:23.246]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:27.729]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:34.234]  Okay, we are simulcasting the second half of the syndicated radio show.
[00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:36.976]  I'm here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:37.756]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:39.137]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:39.157 --> 00:00:40.518]  It's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:41.539]  weekdays.
[00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.841]  And we simulcast at least the last two hours.
[00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:45.842]  Some days we do the whole show.
[00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:53.667]  Simulcasting in living color, the radio show turns into a slash TV show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:58.050]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv supporters out there that are members.
[00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:02.633]  And all the listeners listening, of course, on the radio as well.
[00:01:02.653 --> 00:01:06.556]  We're going to take a few calls, finish up with Sherry and others.
[00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:08.237]  Phil Berg is coming up.
[00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:15.902]  I haven't in months covered the birther issue, his birth certificate, because I wanted to sit back and really study it first.
[00:01:17.323 --> 00:01:18.864]  And I've been studying it now for a year.
[00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:22.847]  And I can say that where there's smoke, there's fire.
[00:01:23.737 --> 00:01:30.903]  They're covering up, they're hiding something, and I can say that with pretty much certainty now, it looks like he probably was born in Kenya.
[00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:54.054]  and uh... this is becoming a major issue and so now we're gonna tackle and the new obama film also gets into it some i want to make a film is on all the other bad stuff he's doing because they always say no one will attack israel policies that's totally made up we do go over the policies in the in the deceit in the corruption uh... but uh... filbert's coming up sherry in texas
[00:01:55.382 --> 00:02:06.588]  Was talking about the squalene and other chemicals they put in vaccines, not just the mercury or aluminum, that cause the autoimmune disease and that cause the body to attack itself.
[00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.091]  And how suddenly out of the blue, tens of millions of Americans are getting these autoimmune diseases.
[00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:20.056]  And I remember during the approval, during the trials of Gardasil, the human papillomavirus, live cancer virus vaccine,
[00:02:21.923 --> 00:02:25.225]  Why were they pushing this national vaccine for something that kills 3,000 people a year?
[00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:26.725]  That's not that many for cancer.
[00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:27.746]  Way down the list.
[00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:29.326]  Very easily treatable.
[00:02:30.447 --> 00:02:32.168]  The vaccine itself didn't protect.
[00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:34.689]  They admitted against most strains of the virus.
[00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:41.252]  So it made no sense until you realize that Merck's cold-blooded eugenicist, with all the other stuff they do.
[00:02:42.132 --> 00:02:50.736]  And then these women were taking it and they were bleeding out of all their orifices and getting these red rashes and having an autoimmune disease where the body just attacks itself.
[00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.693]  And then after your body kind of burns out, then you don't have any immune system left.
[00:02:55.793 --> 00:03:01.678]  First it goes crazy, then you... And they're in wheelchairs, and they're dying, and... I keep talking about this.
[00:03:01.918 --> 00:03:04.000]  You know, Google for folks right now on screen, guys.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.463]  Gardasil deaths, or Gardasil autoimmune.
[00:03:07.483 --> 00:03:08.824]  I mean, they know it does this.
[00:03:09.664 --> 00:03:12.106]  But the drug company got government immunity.
[00:03:13.287 --> 00:03:16.110]  And so this lady Sherry was bringing up, for people that just joined us,
[00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.653]  She's been doing her own research, which we talked about, with what these immune activators, like squalene and others, do.
[00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:26.154]  Tell folks more about it in closing.
[00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:40.300]  Well, basically, they're antigen sparing, which means that they claim that this is wonderful because we get to reduce the amount of vaccine that we need for the dose.
[00:03:43.206 --> 00:03:46.867]  What they really mean by antigen sparing is they're putting an adjuvant in there.
[00:03:46.887 --> 00:03:53.210]  Yeah, it turns your immune system way up so it recognizes the tiny amount of cancer virus they put in you.
[00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.430]  Exactly.
[00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:03.213]  They say a more robust response and words like that.
[00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:10.616]  That's kind of creepy, but they like to make things that are horrible sound good.
[00:04:11.944 --> 00:04:28.358]  They say their strategic goal is to expand the supply of pre-pandemic and pandemic influenza vaccines, but their specific aim is to determine whether the antigens can be used safely and effectively with adjuvants.
[00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.662]  They specifically mention the adjuvants, and they've never been approved in the United States.
[00:04:33.283 --> 00:04:35.585]  The squalene has never been approved.
[00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:40.262]  You know, that's pretty scary.
[00:04:40.282 --> 00:04:47.966]  It's never been approved, but... But they've been given, they've been given FDA waivers under the pandemic emergency to put it in there.
[00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:52.589]  Yeah, that's like giving someone immunity for murder, premeditatedly.
[00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:53.969]  These are eugenicists.
[00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:54.910]  Great points, Sherry.
[00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.112]  Glad you checked out the info for yourself and found out it was far worse than I was even saying.
[00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.153]  It always is, folks.
[00:05:01.253 --> 00:05:02.814]  I don't have words to describe it.
[00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:04.435]  One has to see The Matrix.
[00:05:04.535 --> 00:05:05.496]  One can't be told about it.
[00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:10.732]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:05:10.993 --> 00:05:12.774]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:05:12.994 --> 00:05:21.281]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:26.746]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:28.688]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:35.250]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:46.194]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:05:46.475 --> 00:05:46.995]  That's right.
[00:05:47.255 --> 00:05:49.556]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.396]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:53.998]  We're good to go.
[00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:07.768]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:09.831]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:06:10.051 --> 00:06:10.672]  Well, you should.
[00:06:10.692 --> 00:06:15.277]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:06:15.517 --> 00:06:16.018]  That's right.
[00:06:16.318 --> 00:06:24.768]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:06:24.988 --> 00:06:26.229]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:27.491]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:06:27.691 --> 00:06:33.315]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:06:33.675 --> 00:06:40.199]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:45.783]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:47.224]  This is real.
[00:06:47.544 --> 00:06:48.284]  Don't miss out.
[00:06:48.604 --> 00:06:55.469]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:56.971]  And get your free handgun.
[00:06:57.151 --> 00:06:59.334]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:06:59.514 --> 00:07:03.018]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:06.142]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:11.909]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:15.931]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:21.755]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:22.055 --> 00:07:26.917]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:27.118 --> 00:07:27.618]  Number three,
[00:07:28.018 --> 00:07:33.461]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:36.962]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:07:37.222 --> 00:07:41.424]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:41.744 --> 00:07:45.346]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:07:45.586 --> 00:07:51.069]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:55.872]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:56.012 --> 00:07:57.553]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:57.793 --> 00:08:00.134]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:03.176]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:08:03.196 --> 00:08:13.102]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:35.090]  Phil J. Berg has fired the first attorney who's filed suit against Barack H. Obama, challenging Senator Obama's lack of constitutional qualifications and eligibility to serve as President of the United States and his cases that are still pending in federal court.
[00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.253]  Berg v. Obama, 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, number 08-4340.
[00:08:38.273 --> 00:08:38.494]  Berg,
[00:08:42.197 --> 00:08:44.699]  As Realtor versus Obama, U.S.
[00:08:44.739 --> 00:08:49.461]  District Court, the District of Columbia, number 08-CV.01933, obamacrimes.com is his site.
[00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:50.362]  You know, I really respect
[00:08:57.748 --> 00:08:58.308]  Phil Berg.
[00:08:59.349 --> 00:09:02.910]  And I was aware of a lot of his work on the Bill of Rights and Constitution previously.
[00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.672]  He was also a Deputy Attorney General of a major state.
[00:09:07.332 --> 00:09:09.433]  He's just done a lot of important work.
[00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:17.057]  And so I first saw him early in the campaign start looking at Obama and the birth certificate.
[00:09:17.777 --> 00:09:19.498]  And we've had him on many times and we've covered it.
[00:09:21.224 --> 00:09:34.050]  I didn't put it in the Obama deception, the big premiere film about Obama, because I knew so many others were covering the birth certificate, and that so many Democrats had closed their minds to the birth certificate.
[00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:43.335]  It was seen as partisan, even though Mr. Berg is a registered Democrat and involved, you know, with the ACLU and everything else, a lifelong Democrat, that it wasn't partisan.
[00:09:43.355 --> 00:09:49.438]  It was a constitutional crisis issue, and how he could be blackmailed with this info, which is clearly going on now.
[00:09:52.566 --> 00:10:15.245]  So in the Obama deception, we cover his carbon tax, his anti-gun stance, his wanting to start all these new wars, lying and hiring nothing but lobbyists, his handlers, the Federal Reserve, people like Geithner who were telling Bush what to do with the bailout, literally his bosses on the financial takeover being Obama's handlers.
[00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.613]  That's why the Obama deception didn't get into it.
[00:10:18.633 --> 00:10:29.587]  It gets into everything that wasn't being covered, everything that wasn't being looked at, while at the same time we've been covering the birther issue, as it's called, here on air.
[00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:32.612]  Now, why do I have Phil Berg here?
[00:10:32.652 --> 00:10:34.012]  Why is he going to be on a lot more?
[00:10:34.313 --> 00:10:43.437]  Why are we going to get Colonel Hollister, who's one of his clients, one of the high-level military officers, coming out and saying, I want to see the birth certificate?
[00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:47.018]  Because it's now reached mega-crest level.
[00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:50.300]  Obama lies and says, I'm not going to hire any lobbyists.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.340]  All he hires is lobbyists.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.502]  He says he's fighting banker bailout money to Goldman Sachs.
[00:10:54.902 --> 00:10:59.564]  It turns out in AIG that he wrote a special piece to the bill to do it.
[00:11:01.087 --> 00:11:02.909]  People know Obama's a liar now.
[00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:09.657]  His approval rating's gone from 84 in the highest for Rasmussen to 49 in six months.
[00:11:09.757 --> 00:11:12.720]  I mean, he is dropping like a rock right now.
[00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:14.322]  In a big way.
[00:11:15.643 --> 00:11:21.029]  And people know that when the media, when the media
[00:11:22.717 --> 00:11:24.058]  Just says there's no truth.
[00:11:24.358 --> 00:11:25.039]  You're kooks.
[00:11:25.339 --> 00:11:27.461]  How dare you ask to look at the birth certificate?
[00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:32.804]  Everybody's seen the birth certificate when they put out a receipt of birth certificate.
[00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:39.409]  Itself, according to many mainline experts and people matching them with their receipts for birth certificate, is a forgery.
[00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:48.276]  So, people see all this and they're really starting to ask very serious questions.
[00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:48.836]  Then, the
[00:11:53.444 --> 00:12:00.871]  Washington Post comes out and makes fun, and number one, of Phil Berg, of anybody and everybody that asks questions.
[00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:03.753]  The birther, brouhaha.
[00:12:04.494 --> 00:12:05.274]  Washington Post.
[00:12:08.237 --> 00:12:15.884]  And it says, speculation about the true citizenship of President Barack Obama has resurfaced in recent days, in part thanks to a viral video.
[00:12:16.544 --> 00:12:20.448]  Despite a widely circulated copy of his certificate of live birth,
[00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:25.730]  Notices in two Honolulu newspapers and other evidence, some won't let the issue die.
[00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:42.983]  Fanning the flames are commentators Lou Dobbs and Rush Limbaugh, who have suggested the question remains unsolved, and ten House Republicans who have co-sponsored bills that will require presidential candidates to provide a copy of their original birth certificate.
[00:12:44.483 --> 00:12:46.685]  And then they ask this stupid poll question.
[00:12:47.346 --> 00:12:49.968]  What for you would clear up the question of Obama's citizenship?
[00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:53.172]  An official certificate and birth notices from two newspapers?
[00:12:55.794 --> 00:13:00.078]  A time machine visit to the hospital on the day of the alleged birth?
[00:13:01.007 --> 00:13:02.508]  Tie him up, throw him in the water.
[00:13:02.608 --> 00:13:05.370]  If he floats, he's an American, saying it's a witch hunt.
[00:13:05.971 --> 00:13:06.711]  Nothing ever.
[00:13:07.212 --> 00:13:11.295]  So see, this poll is meant to ridicule anybody asking questions.
[00:13:11.695 --> 00:13:18.660]  Even the semi-serious first question, first option, an official certificate, and birth notices from two newspapers.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.322]  See, an official birth certificate would have done it.
[00:13:21.963 --> 00:13:23.244]  But they won't do it.
[00:13:23.504 --> 00:13:23.824]  Why?
[00:13:24.284 --> 00:13:27.707]  Why has he signed an executive order blocking the release of that document?
[00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:28.507]  Oh yes!
[00:13:29.588 --> 00:13:29.949]  So see,
[00:13:30.908 --> 00:13:33.629]  Now we have his grandmother reportedly saying he was born there.
[00:13:33.649 --> 00:13:37.950]  Now we have the government saying they put a plaque up at his birthplace.
[00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.651]  I mean, all of this evidence.
[00:13:41.691 --> 00:13:45.011]  And now we have the expert, the guy who was there day one on all of this.
[00:13:45.412 --> 00:13:51.093]  And my whole issue is, I didn't know one way or the other, but the way they act suspicious, the way they act scared.
[00:13:51.313 --> 00:13:52.973]  Then I saw Bill Maher this weekend.
[00:13:53.373 --> 00:13:58.075]  I watched politically, you know, his little propaganda real time with Bill Maher.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.081]  He acted scared.
[00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:05.502]  Mrs. Eisenhower on the show acted scared.
[00:14:05.522 --> 00:14:07.683]  They're freaked out, and now I know why.
[00:14:08.103 --> 00:14:18.268]  Everywhere congressmen go, they're shouted down by this issue under the surface because when the mainstream media just pats somebody on the head and says, you've seen the birth certificate, when we haven't,
[00:14:19.068 --> 00:14:29.651]  And when there's all these cover-ups going on, and his mother not being living in the United States long enough when she had him, because you've got to have one parent who's lived here a certain amount of time for him to be present.
[00:14:29.691 --> 00:14:31.151]  He's not eligible that way either.
[00:14:31.692 --> 00:14:33.572]  Any way you cut it, this is crazy.
[00:14:33.612 --> 00:14:36.813]  We now go to Phil Berg, and I appreciate him joining us.
[00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:38.754]  I just wanted to recap the basics.
[00:14:39.054 --> 00:14:40.514]  Obamacrimes.com.
[00:14:40.854 --> 00:14:43.315]  Bottom line, Mr. Berg, what's really going on here?
[00:14:44.073 --> 00:14:45.534]  Well, it's a massive cover-up.
[00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:55.383]  I believe it's the biggest hoax ever put forth to the citizens of this country in over 230 years in the history of our country, and one person's responsible for it.
[00:14:55.783 --> 00:15:00.127]  And that's actually his real name, we believe, is not Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:05.872]  We believe his legal name today is Barry Sotoro when he was adopted in Indonesia.
[00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:08.995]  And when all is said and done, and the truth will come out,
[00:15:09.435 --> 00:15:32.618]  I think Obama, or Sotoro, whatever you want to call him, his wife Michelle Obama, Howard Dean, the former head of the Democratic National Committee, other officials of the Democratic National Committee, senior campaign officials, and now senior administration officials who know the truth about this, should all be subjected to the criminal justice system and tried, and those that are convicted should go to jail, and Obama should go to jail and then be deported.
[00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:35.900]  This is outrageous, what is going on here.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:41.623]  When Arnold Schwarzenegger, people have talked to him, the governor of California, about running for president, what has he said?
[00:15:41.683 --> 00:15:42.844]  Amend the Constitution.
[00:15:43.404 --> 00:15:48.627]  And Barack Obama, basically, without saying it is, he's saying, I'm walking all over the Constitution.
[00:15:49.027 --> 00:15:50.588]  I don't care about the Constitution.
[00:15:51.049 --> 00:15:55.591]  Why would all of his records, every record of Obama is sealed.
[00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:56.532]  Every record.
[00:15:56.972 --> 00:16:00.413]  And I'm the first one to give a response on why his college records are being sealed.
[00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:08.956]  I believe his records from Occidental, Columbia University, and Harvard Law School are sealed, because I believe they will show that he applied for and received foreign aid.
[00:16:09.476 --> 00:16:10.936]  This is outrageous!
[00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:24.220]  The national media should be the, uh, I don't know if you saw it on Saturday's New York Times, they actually quoted one of my quotes, the interview I made, because of the upswing with the media, and I said, I wish the national media, including the New York Times, I wish I could sue them.
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.220]  We're good to go.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:50.626]  And he stated, I'm now in my, I arrived in Oregon, this is my 57th state, and they wouldn't let me go to Alaska or Hawaii.
[00:16:50.906 --> 00:16:54.749]  I didn't know we had 59 states in this country, in this great country of ours.
[00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:55.670]  And you know what?
[00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.873]  If anybody else had said that, it would have been front page news for weeks.
[00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:07.422]  Because remember, going back to Dan Quayle, Dan Quayle just misspelled the word potato and they didn't let him live it down.
[00:17:07.862 --> 00:17:10.565]  But Obama gets a free ride no matter what's going on.
[00:17:10.826 --> 00:17:16.092]  I think he just stepped too far when he was commenting on this incident with the police officer the other day.
[00:17:17.894 --> 00:17:27.320]  With everything else, and as you said, Alex, all his promises are turning into fiction at this point because he talks out of both sides of his mouth, but that's not why I'm there.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.081]  I'm there to enforce the US Constitution.
[00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:35.024]  I'm there for the 305 million people in this country who deserve to know the truth.
[00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:38.486]  I'm there for our forefathers, and I'm there for the 1.5 million
[00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:40.428]  You know, Mr. Berg,
[00:17:58.806 --> 00:18:08.776]  I don't want to get into conspiracy theories, but were they planning this so they can then have to have an amendment to make a foreign-born president for Schwarzenegger?
[00:18:09.417 --> 00:18:18.426]  I mean, they knew he was born in Kenya, and this was so unbelievable for me that I had trouble, even though I know you're a credible person,
[00:18:19.347 --> 00:18:31.315]  In really getting my mind around this and then as the cover-up expanded and now they won't release any of his college records and his foundation records and his mother's records and his father's records and they guard them.
[00:18:32.242 --> 00:18:35.683]  Like, it's the Kennedy assassination, you know, records or something.
[00:18:36.164 --> 00:18:56.711]  I mean, they're certainly acting suspicious, and now they're on TV going, we're scared, you know, these crazies won't listen to us, we've given them the records, when they haven't given us the records, and they would have just released the stinking birth certificate and this cover-up of saying they have released all his records, when it's not true.
[00:18:56.771 --> 00:18:58.192]  I gotta tell you, Mr. Berg,
[00:18:58.692 --> 00:19:01.854]  You know, I will take my time making a decision about something.
[00:19:02.134 --> 00:19:03.515]  And if I'm not sure, I'll hold back.
[00:19:03.555 --> 00:19:12.682]  But in time, in the fullness of time, hindsight's 20-20, as they say, I gotta tell you, my gut and all the intellectual evidence tells me he was born in Kenya.
[00:19:13.022 --> 00:19:20.027]  It fits in with his dad, the Madrasas, growing up in Indonesia, his real name's Barry Sotero.
[00:19:20.507 --> 00:19:22.329]  Everything about this guy is fake.
[00:19:22.689 --> 00:19:28.253]  How could the CIA, how could the Justice Department, how could the government let him become president
[00:19:28.655 --> 00:19:29.828]  Knowing this would come out!
[00:19:30.725 --> 00:19:40.330]  Well, first off, I've been advised by some high people over in Britain that our FBI and CIA know the truth about him, but there's no reporting.
[00:19:41.051 --> 00:19:47.114]  When you run for president, there's nobody you have to check in and show that you are who you are.
[00:19:47.694 --> 00:19:56.559]  But think about it, he's committed fraud in every one of the states, unless he can show us documentation that he has legally changed his name after being adopted into Indonesia.
[00:19:56.879 --> 00:20:00.121]  By signing his name as Barack Hussein Obama, that would be fraud.
[00:20:00.561 --> 00:20:00.982]  Stay there.
[00:20:01.042 --> 00:20:02.884]  Yeah, and you're a great legal mind.
[00:20:02.924 --> 00:20:04.185]  He's done hundreds of things.
[00:20:04.385 --> 00:20:05.847]  We'll cover him when we come back.
[00:20:07.188 --> 00:20:07.728]  You worry.
[00:20:07.869 --> 00:20:09.951]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:20:10.231 --> 00:20:10.511]  Hi.
[00:20:10.772 --> 00:20:13.254]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:20:13.574 --> 00:20:17.819]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:20.301]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:20:20.582 --> 00:20:23.605]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:20:23.925 --> 00:20:24.545]  We're good to go.
[00:20:53.865 --> 00:20:57.268]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[00:21:12.657 --> 00:21:15.718]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:18.700]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:25.222]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[00:21:25.823 --> 00:21:27.643]  The only real option is precious metals.
[00:21:28.183 --> 00:21:33.866]  For your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:37.462]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package.
[00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:41.925]  And I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[00:21:42.485 --> 00:21:46.667]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:21:46.907 --> 00:21:51.450]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.792]  And together we can develop a Make Sense program before the clock runs out.
[00:21:56.432 --> 00:21:58.173]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:21:58.333 --> 00:21:59.734]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[00:22:07.705 --> 00:22:13.008]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:13.509 --> 00:22:20.493]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:21.093 --> 00:22:27.257]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:27.677 --> 00:22:29.517]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:29.657 --> 00:22:32.058]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:32.138 --> 00:22:43.081]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:45.021]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:46.801]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:53.483]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:54.156 --> 00:23:01.931]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:02.432 --> 00:23:03.574]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:04.015 --> 00:23:05.197]  The people strike back!
[00:23:07.666 --> 00:23:13.131]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:23:13.171 --> 00:23:13.691]  and the world.
[00:23:13.971 --> 00:23:17.414]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:23:17.834 --> 00:23:24.060]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.121]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:23:26.361 --> 00:23:34.308]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:23:34.568 --> 00:23:39.013]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:23:39.273 --> 00:23:44.819]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:23:45.099 --> 00:23:47.101]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:23:47.261 --> 00:23:50.605]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[00:23:50.945 --> 00:23:51.245]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[00:23:51.265 --> 00:23:51.326]  1-800-453-2202.
[00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:53.668]  Or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[00:23:53.688 --> 00:23:55.709]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:23:55.729 --> 00:23:56.410]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:24:20.249 --> 00:24:27.997]  Alright, as usual folks, I'm just ranting because for a year or more I've been looking and studying the birther issue.
[00:24:28.137 --> 00:24:29.198]  And you have scales.
[00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:35.444]  And early on there was more evidence that he was born in Kenya than that he was born in Hawaii.
[00:24:36.801 --> 00:24:42.527]  Having a fake name and covering up his history and saying he doesn't have Muslim roots.
[00:24:42.587 --> 00:24:53.278]  I'm not saying that's bad, but lying about it and now saying he does have Muslim roots and saying he's a Muslim on TV and speech after speech and saying it was an accident later, probably done on purpose.
[00:24:56.025 --> 00:24:59.208]  And just all his deception and covering up the college records.
[00:24:59.589 --> 00:25:05.835]  But Attorney Phil Berg has gone over the Constitution, Bill of Rights, him lying, lying on entrance forms.
[00:25:05.855 --> 00:25:10.439]  You were getting to that, Mr. Berg, the first lawyer to speak up, the first guy to file suits.
[00:25:11.961 --> 00:25:17.406]  You were getting into all the lies we know he's told, how you were saying he should be prosecuted for fraud.
[00:25:17.726 --> 00:25:18.247]  Get into that.
[00:25:19.753 --> 00:25:21.675]  Well, I think, first off, let me say this.
[00:25:21.995 --> 00:25:26.379]  Significant is the fact that this has been around on the internet for over two years.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:34.987]  Significant is the fact that in June 2008, two months before I got involved in this, on the Obama campaign website,
[00:25:35.507 --> 00:25:38.929]  They put this document, which they keep trying to say is a birth certificate.
[00:25:39.369 --> 00:25:39.810]  It's not.
[00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:47.875]  It's a certification of live birth, and our expert has determined, and it's on our website, Obamacrime.com, that the document is a phony.
[00:25:48.295 --> 00:25:48.895]  It's a fraud.
[00:25:48.955 --> 00:25:49.756]  It's been altered.
[00:25:50.256 --> 00:26:02.063]  First off, when I got a phone call at the beginning of August 2008 from an individual I've worked with for years, a young lady, Linda, and she said, Phil, have you heard about this Obama not being a natural born citizen?
[00:26:02.123 --> 00:26:03.104]  I said, absolutely.
[00:26:03.704 --> 00:26:04.345]  Do you know about it?
[00:26:04.365 --> 00:26:05.105]  I said, not too much.
[00:26:05.185 --> 00:26:06.186]  She said, well, check it out.
[00:26:06.206 --> 00:26:08.168]  She said, it's for real.
[00:26:08.228 --> 00:26:09.188]  He's not natural born.
[00:26:09.228 --> 00:26:11.350]  He has no business being president.
[00:26:11.951 --> 00:26:16.434]  And Phil, you're the only attorney in the country with breasts, you know what, to sue Obama.
[00:26:17.115 --> 00:26:19.597]  So I looked into it, and two weeks later, I sued Obama.
[00:26:19.637 --> 00:26:21.158]  I sued him August 21st, 2008.
[00:26:21.398 --> 00:26:26.062]  That's significant because that was before the Democratic National Convention.
[00:26:26.542 --> 00:26:29.945]  I sued Obama, and not only Obama, I sued the Democratic National Committee.
[00:26:30.505 --> 00:26:31.705]  Think about it, Al.
[00:26:31.725 --> 00:26:32.466]  Two different roles.
[00:26:32.586 --> 00:26:37.427]  Obama wanted to be president, but the Democratic National Committee, of course, wanted a Democrat as president.
[00:26:37.688 --> 00:26:43.590]  But they had a higher duty, in my opinion, and that is to convey to the American public that they have a qualified candidate.
[00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.570]  I expected them to do something.
[00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.411]  They didn't, because they didn't respond before the convention.
[00:26:48.851 --> 00:26:49.692]  He got nominated.
[00:26:49.712 --> 00:26:52.232]  He had his big thing at the football stadium.
[00:26:52.693 --> 00:26:56.894]  And a month later, they filed a joint motion to dismiss, which infuriated me.
[00:26:56.974 --> 00:26:59.395]  It just showed that there was collusion between both of them.
[00:26:59.975 --> 00:27:00.915]  And I really mean that.
[00:27:01.676 --> 00:27:17.941]  When I also, when I filed suit August 21st, significant as, and I put out a press release, I said, Obama, if I am incorrect, prove me wrong, show me your long form, your vault copy of your birth certificate, and I'll walk away.
[00:27:18.581 --> 00:27:19.101]  I'll go away.
[00:27:23.246 --> 00:27:24.407]  Did he show that to me?
[00:27:24.627 --> 00:27:25.768]  No, he didn't show that to me.
[00:27:27.229 --> 00:27:27.830]  What did he do?
[00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.670]  Nothing.
[00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.593]  He didn't respond to that, which is significant.
[00:27:31.993 --> 00:27:33.974]  And the vault copy for your listeners is different.
[00:27:34.535 --> 00:27:46.845]  The vault copy of a birth certificate, and those that have a real birth certificate will know, a vault copy has the weight of the baby, the length of the baby, it has the hospital name, the doctor's name, the doctor's signature.
[00:27:47.505 --> 00:27:51.748]  All of these things which I just mentioned are not on this phony, this certification of live birth.
[00:27:52.228 --> 00:28:06.238]  And a certification of live birth, back then, they might have changed it recently in Hawaii, what it's going to be used for, but back then, you could not even register your child for Little League, you couldn't get a passport on it, you couldn't even
[00:28:07.745 --> 00:28:10.507]  Uh, get a land grant in Hawaii based upon that.
[00:28:10.567 --> 00:28:13.650]  So, and they keep trying to shove it down our throat.
[00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.593]  Like you had Chris Matthews on MSNBC there waving in front of the camera.
[00:28:17.973 --> 00:28:19.715]  Well, hey Chris, watch what you're waving.
[00:28:19.755 --> 00:28:21.656]  You're not waving a birth certificate.
[00:28:22.037 --> 00:28:23.418]  Stop being phony out there.
[00:28:23.738 --> 00:28:29.342]  They're covering it more and more because I think part what happened with Congressman Cassell in Delaware.
[00:28:29.402 --> 00:28:30.804]  He held a town meeting on June 30, 2009.
[00:28:32.805 --> 00:28:40.552]  Well, that was the point I was going to make, and we're going to play that video when we come back in the next segment or part of it.
[00:28:49.759 --> 00:29:00.808]  Is that this was spontaneous and now other videos are surfacing with Democrat and Republican congressmen being booed and whole crowds are spontaneously angry, even Democrats.
[00:29:01.228 --> 00:29:11.677]  This is a massive underground issue, probably the biggest issue, because I think at a fundamental level, but you're the expert, give me your, you know, inside take on this.
[00:29:11.697 --> 00:29:17.101]  I don't think anybody's got their finger on the pulse of this, like Phil Berg who's online with us right now, but when we come back I want to ask you,
[00:29:17.421 --> 00:29:18.502]  And we're going to play this clip.
[00:29:18.862 --> 00:29:19.763]  You know, the big question.
[00:29:20.484 --> 00:29:28.810]  Is the main issue that people are insulted by being patted on the head and said, we've shown you the birth certificate, sit down and shut up.
[00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.514]  When Kenyan newspapers are saying he was born over there and they're proud of it.
[00:29:33.894 --> 00:29:37.617]  His grandmother's running around on video saying he was born over there.
[00:29:37.637 --> 00:29:39.739]  His dad lived over there.
[00:29:39.759 --> 00:29:42.060]  You know, he's got his cousin.
[00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:47.546]  Starting, you know, riots over there with Obama advising him in the Senate how to do it.
[00:29:47.966 --> 00:29:54.653]  You've got Obama operating under another name, lying on college forms, sealing everything.
[00:29:54.673 --> 00:29:56.535]  What's making folks so upset?
[00:29:57.356 --> 00:29:58.257]  We're on the march.
[00:29:58.757 --> 00:30:00.359]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.963]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.022 --> 00:30:08.603]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:08.723 --> 00:30:13.306]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:30:13.446 --> 00:30:16.207]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:30:16.407 --> 00:30:19.269]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:30:19.449 --> 00:30:24.172]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:30:24.412 --> 00:30:25.313]  If you simply prepare.
[00:30:25.533 --> 00:30:28.475]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:30:28.775 --> 00:30:35.681]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:30:35.761 --> 00:30:38.883]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:30:39.043 --> 00:30:40.925]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[00:30:44.187 --> 00:30:50.253]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:30:50.454 --> 00:30:54.198]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:54.218 --> 00:30:55.699]  Again, 1-800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:30:55.739 --> 00:30:56.180]  Take action today.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.182]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:31:06.749 --> 00:31:10.752]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:31:10.992 --> 00:31:12.774]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:31:12.994 --> 00:31:21.280]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.744]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:31:27.065 --> 00:31:28.686]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:31:28.926 --> 00:31:35.249]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:31:35.449 --> 00:31:46.214]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:31:46.494 --> 00:31:46.994]  That's right.
[00:31:47.254 --> 00:31:49.555]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:31:49.835 --> 00:31:51.416]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:31:53.977 --> 00:32:11.904]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:32:12.024 --> 00:32:14.004]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:32:14.104 --> 00:32:16.405]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:32:16.565 --> 00:32:18.406]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:32:18.826 --> 00:32:20.186]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:32:20.447 --> 00:32:21.487]  There is a solution.
[00:32:21.727 --> 00:32:29.752]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:32:30.153 --> 00:32:37.217]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:32:43.661 --> 00:32:49.225]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:32:49.645 --> 00:32:53.471]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[00:33:20.017 --> 00:33:30.160]  We're going to take a few calls from Phil Berg coming up before he leaves us in about 27 minutes.
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:30.360]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:30.420]  800-259-9231.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.081]  Specifically for Phil Berg on this subject.
[00:33:33.301 --> 00:33:41.363]  We're going to be having him up a lot more in the future because going back last year I said it looked like they were covering up and he was probably born in Kenya.
[00:33:41.984 --> 00:33:44.664]  Or certainly his mother didn't live in the United States long enough.
[00:33:44.704 --> 00:33:45.785]  They have laws on that.
[00:33:47.847 --> 00:33:50.469]  to be able to then him to be president.
[00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:52.871]  You can't just have one parent who's a U.S.
[00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:54.592]  citizen, too, and be president.
[00:33:54.672 --> 00:34:04.280]  So we'll break that down with the expert, Phil Berg, here in just a moment and take your phone calls and play this video that's getting so much attention.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:10.905]  But everywhere I go, people come up to me in grocery store lines and they say, Alex, what's going on with the birth certificate?
[00:34:10.945 --> 00:34:12.806]  And I go, he lies about everything.
[00:34:13.587 --> 00:34:16.008]  His name, Barack Obama, isn't even his real name.
[00:34:17.304 --> 00:34:19.304]  He's covering it up, why hasn't he released it?
[00:34:19.825 --> 00:34:25.506]  Why before this was an issue did they post the fake certificate, the receipt?
[00:34:26.006 --> 00:34:34.468]  See, I mean as an investigator and anybody who's researched any basic criminology, this really looks bad.
[00:34:35.188 --> 00:34:40.069]  But again, to say we're kooks and nuts and bad to want it to be released,
[00:34:41.573 --> 00:34:42.293]  We're not bad.
[00:34:42.373 --> 00:34:43.253]  He needs to prove it.
[00:34:43.273 --> 00:34:49.434]  I mean, you've got to show this to get a driver's license, or to get on welfare, or to join the military, but not to be president.
[00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:54.955]  Going to Philburg in just a moment, I want to tell you about some of the sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[00:34:55.916 --> 00:34:57.056]  One of them is HomeGain.
[00:34:57.516 --> 00:35:02.097]  If you go to Infowars.com, you can click on Max, the little orange gorilla.
[00:35:02.137 --> 00:35:02.957]  He's their mascot.
[00:35:03.457 --> 00:35:06.117]  And that's if you forget the web address.
[00:35:06.177 --> 00:35:09.378]  It's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[00:35:10.509 --> 00:35:17.255]  And the best part about the site is it can make you or save you a ton of money, and it's absolutely 100% free.
[00:35:17.535 --> 00:35:19.036]  Free, free, free.
[00:35:19.477 --> 00:35:20.958]  It's advertiser-driven.
[00:35:21.779 --> 00:35:30.587]  And so it's homegame.com, bunch of free services like the Home Sell Maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can help increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[00:35:30.927 --> 00:35:33.629]  For 10 years, these folks have been helping home sellers and buyers.
[00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.432]  Now is no time to mess around with your largest asset find.
[00:35:36.972 --> 00:35:38.833]  Equality Realtor at HomeGain.com.
[00:35:39.253 --> 00:35:46.716]  They also have other systems where you can put in your home address and they give you what the industry is internally seeing what your home is really worth.
[00:35:47.016 --> 00:35:48.337]  HomeGain.com.
[00:35:48.897 --> 00:35:58.281]  And lastly, in these crazy uncertain times with crime exploding, talk of martial law, depression, all this crud,
[00:35:59.471 --> 00:36:00.972]  It's not enough to just own firearms.
[00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:04.154]  You see record firearms purchasing going on and ammo purchasing.
[00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:05.615]  You need firearms training.
[00:36:06.096 --> 00:36:11.920]  And you can take a local course and get the basics of safety, but then the next level is front sight.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:17.043]  And long before they were a sponsor, this was the name of above law enforcement and military training.
[00:36:17.103 --> 00:36:20.326]  But it's not a Rambo attitude, tough guy thing.
[00:36:20.386 --> 00:36:23.348]  It is a family training situation.
[00:36:23.968 --> 00:36:40.107]  And they have a deal where you can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar, and act fast, you can get a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice absolutely free.
[00:36:40.447 --> 00:36:41.708]  It's FrontSight.com.
[00:36:41.728 --> 00:36:43.811]  You do not want to miss this deal.
[00:36:43.851 --> 00:36:44.452]  And believe me,
[00:36:45.478 --> 00:36:53.384]  If I wasn't tied down, making films, and writing books, and running the radio show, and doing all the stuff I'm doing, I would be at front sight.
[00:36:53.404 --> 00:36:57.648]  I almost went to front sight nine years ago, because everybody I know is telling me how great it is.
[00:36:58.228 --> 00:36:59.929]  I've gotten rusty on my Second Amendment.
[00:36:59.949 --> 00:37:03.452]  I used to be just an unbelievable, a scary shot, folks.
[00:37:03.472 --> 00:37:06.374]  I got into the same hole with a deer rifle at 200 yards.
[00:37:06.435 --> 00:37:07.896]  Now I'm lucky to hit the bullseye.
[00:37:08.723 --> 00:37:09.904]  You need your training.
[00:37:10.104 --> 00:37:11.864]  It's four and five day courses.
[00:37:12.004 --> 00:37:12.945]  Super inexpensive.
[00:37:13.285 --> 00:37:14.806]  FrontSite.com.
[00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:16.626]  FrontSite.com.
[00:37:16.686 --> 00:37:20.568]  Check out everything on the site or sign up for their free newsletter at FrontSite.com.
[00:37:20.828 --> 00:37:21.088]  Okay.
[00:37:21.668 --> 00:37:24.850]  Going now to our esteemed guest, Obamacrimes.com.
[00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:29.812]  I really appreciate his courage, his doggedness, his stick-to-it-ness.
[00:37:30.592 --> 00:37:33.314]  And his instinct to get on this case.
[00:37:33.395 --> 00:37:42.983]  And before, we interviewed Mr. Berg a year ago about this, more than a year ago, and he'd say, well, I'm a Democrat, I like Obama, I just, you know, where there's smoke, there's fire.
[00:37:43.103 --> 00:37:55.153]  Now, a lot more has come out, run through before we go to calls, more of the evidence of the cover-up, and the fact that this is building, and that, well, that first question before we hit the break, Mr. Berg,
[00:37:56.054 --> 00:37:57.897]  Why is it now exploding?
[00:37:58.317 --> 00:38:01.461]  Is it the way the media just dismisses everybody?
[00:38:02.122 --> 00:38:05.186]  And the way Obama's been caught lying about so much other stuff?
[00:38:06.482 --> 00:38:10.145]  Well, I think it's because, number one, Obama's dropping in the polls.
[00:38:10.585 --> 00:38:12.766]  He's not coming through on the various proposals.
[00:38:12.806 --> 00:38:14.648]  He said he was going to be the candidate of change.
[00:38:15.228 --> 00:38:20.852]  And when you said, I think he's even set himself up to be blackmailed, and I think he could be blackmailed already.
[00:38:21.412 --> 00:38:22.013]  Think about it.
[00:38:22.313 --> 00:38:25.495]  Candidate of change in his cabinet is 70% Bill Clinton.
[00:38:25.895 --> 00:38:27.436]  Who's his Secretary of Defense?
[00:38:27.817 --> 00:38:28.377]  Bill Gates?
[00:38:28.677 --> 00:38:29.498]  Leftover from
[00:38:30.298 --> 00:38:30.618]  Bush?
[00:38:30.658 --> 00:38:31.699]  Does that even make sense?
[00:38:32.039 --> 00:38:32.799]  It doesn't make sense.
[00:38:33.159 --> 00:38:38.481]  And he recently talked about reducing the restrictions on travel to Cuba.
[00:38:38.901 --> 00:38:42.082]  Perhaps Cuba, perhaps Castro has a copy of his documentation.
[00:38:42.582 --> 00:38:44.583]  What happens when China and Russia get it?
[00:38:44.883 --> 00:38:46.323]  What happens when Iran gets it?
[00:38:46.363 --> 00:38:51.445]  Because you know these papers are around there, and you know some of these foreign governments will pay a million dollars for it.
[00:38:51.885 --> 00:38:54.526]  But talking about a million dollars, why would Obama
[00:38:55.226 --> 00:38:56.747]  You know, I gotta stop you, Phil.
[00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:57.627]  Incredible point.
[00:38:58.287 --> 00:39:04.429]  All the time they catch clerks at DMVs selling 10,000 fake driver's licenses, 3,000 bucks a piece.
[00:39:04.449 --> 00:39:05.250]  They're getting millions.
[00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:08.791]  They're constantly catching federal clerks selling data.
[00:39:09.031 --> 00:39:13.693]  You better believe foreign governments would pay 10 million bucks for the proof.
[00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:15.390]  Absolutely.
[00:39:15.611 --> 00:39:17.292]  What happens when Iran gets approved?
[00:39:17.592 --> 00:39:18.733]  What's that going to cost us?
[00:39:19.133 --> 00:39:25.157]  And perhaps that's why when Obama travels overseas, every place he's going has been apologizing to the United States.
[00:39:25.337 --> 00:39:26.098]  We should be apologizing.
[00:39:26.158 --> 00:39:28.379]  What about bowing before the King of Saudi Arabia?
[00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:29.440]  Unbelievable.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.100]  Unbelievable.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.941]  And did the media make a big thing about that?
[00:39:32.462 --> 00:39:33.042]  Not at all.
[00:39:33.402 --> 00:39:34.623]  He gets a free ride.
[00:39:34.843 --> 00:39:36.785]  Like I said, I wish we could sue the national media.
[00:39:36.825 --> 00:39:39.907]  I think, though, because of what's happening at these town meetings,
[00:39:40.847 --> 00:39:44.208]  That tape went out and other people now are being questioned about it.
[00:39:44.488 --> 00:39:46.548]  It's now spreading out to more and more people.
[00:39:46.808 --> 00:39:51.229]  Like you said, people must show their own, your listeners have to show their birth certificate.
[00:39:51.629 --> 00:39:55.810]  For Little League, for driver's license, for college, for marriage, different things in different states.
[00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.091]  But for a passport, why is Obama getting a free ride?
[00:40:00.031 --> 00:40:05.372]  Somebody said he loves this, he loves being out there with this because it diverts attention from other things.
[00:40:05.492 --> 00:40:08.133]  I disagree with that person the other day on the air on a different show.
[00:40:08.633 --> 00:40:09.674]  He doesn't want this thing.
[00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:13.478]  He had hoped it would go away with this document two months before I got into it.
[00:40:13.838 --> 00:40:22.346]  And I'm proud to say that I'm glad I got into it, because since I have, it's mushroomed into lawsuits all across this country, which didn't get the media attention.
[00:40:22.406 --> 00:40:25.749]  But it's now getting the media attention because you have congressmen.
[00:40:27.131 --> 00:40:29.152]  One congressman introduced a new bill.
[00:40:30.413 --> 00:40:42.680]  A new piece of legislation, which he's gotten seven other Republicans, a Republican introduced it, saying that as of the year 2012, anyone running for president should have to show proof that they are a natural-born citizen.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.041]  Well, why are no Democrats joining into that?
[00:40:45.341 --> 00:40:47.562]  Because they all know that he's not natural-born.
[00:40:47.602 --> 00:40:51.564]  They won't join into it because that's what Obama plans to run for re-election.
[00:40:51.944 --> 00:40:54.946]  But I hope to legally remove him from office before that.
[00:40:55.366 --> 00:40:58.608]  We're not in the context of owing in a financial crisis in this country.
[00:40:58.968 --> 00:41:00.409]  We have a constitutional crisis.
[00:41:00.949 --> 00:41:01.469]  Think about it.
[00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:06.492]  Every law that he's signed, every appointment that he's made, is void or voidable.
[00:41:07.213 --> 00:41:10.094]  And look what he's doing now to even bypass Congress.
[00:41:10.415 --> 00:41:11.615]  He's appointing his czars.
[00:41:11.715 --> 00:41:13.897]  I think he's up to 19 czars or something like that.
[00:41:14.337 --> 00:41:17.919]  Each czar is going to spend 10 to 20 million dollars for their staff.
[00:41:18.499 --> 00:41:23.101]  Because Azor doesn't have to, it's not a cabinet person, doesn't have to go through the scrutiny of the Senate.
[00:41:24.081 --> 00:41:29.923]  Not that the scrutiny of the Congress is so good anymore because of just what they've done here.
[00:41:29.943 --> 00:41:32.044]  They've been giving a rubber stamp to this guy.
[00:41:32.704 --> 00:41:33.624]  That's a disgrace.
[00:41:34.025 --> 00:41:35.685]  And that's why the three lawsuits pending.
[00:41:36.005 --> 00:41:37.946]  The case is significant right now.
[00:41:38.586 --> 00:41:45.108]  I mentioned the Hollister case, but a significant one is, for your listeners, I filed a case that was sealed back in November 7, 2008.
[00:41:47.329 --> 00:41:48.270]  I couldn't talk about it.
[00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.552]  It wasn't sealed because I filed against Obama.
[00:41:50.612 --> 00:41:56.315]  It was sealed because it was filed under what's called the False Claims Act, or QUITAM, Q-U-I-T-A-M.
[00:41:56.996 --> 00:41:58.797]  All False Claims Act cases are sealed.
[00:41:59.177 --> 00:42:03.020]  The basic False Claims Act comes against for Medicaid and Medicare fraud.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.103]  It's like one of your listeners right now, their neighborhood's ripping off the government.
[00:42:07.423 --> 00:42:16.549]  So they would file this action against a neighbor, and they would file on behalf of themselves, and as the relater on behalf of the United States government,
[00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:20.091]  The government is served, but your neighbor is not served.
[00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:23.533]  So in my case, the government was served, but Obama was not served.
[00:42:23.913 --> 00:42:27.475]  It gives the government 60 days to review the case to make one of three decisions.
[00:42:27.635 --> 00:42:29.196]  One, that they will prosecute the case.
[00:42:29.736 --> 00:42:33.058]  Two, that the relator can prosecute the case on behalf of the government.
[00:42:33.338 --> 00:42:36.120]  Or three, to close out the case and not prosecute me.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.481]  Well, very few cases are closed.
[00:42:38.801 --> 00:42:45.365]  But what happened in my case, when I filed it, number one, the 60 days stretched into about six months because they got extensions.
[00:42:45.945 --> 00:42:48.667]  They filed for a motion to dismiss the action.
[00:42:49.148 --> 00:42:53.010]  I filed an interesting case when we went to court because it was a sealed case.
[00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:54.031]  I couldn't talk about it.
[00:42:54.592 --> 00:42:58.214]  The actual, when the attorneys arrived in the room, everyone there, they locked the door.
[00:42:58.655 --> 00:43:00.256]  The windows in the back were actually covered.
[00:43:00.276 --> 00:43:01.857]  I mean, this was a sealed case.
[00:43:02.277 --> 00:43:04.239]  At the end of the, the judge walks out and says,
[00:43:04.859 --> 00:43:09.263]  I just want you to know, Mr. Berg, that this is the D.C.
[00:43:09.323 --> 00:43:11.025]  Federal Court, and the D.C.
[00:43:11.085 --> 00:43:22.796]  Court of Appeals, they have their own Court of Appeals because there's so many cases against the government, has ruled that I can give no input in this case, so at the end of your presentation, it'll be up to the government whether they want to proceed or not.
[00:43:23.336 --> 00:43:24.798]  How outrageous is that?
[00:43:25.218 --> 00:43:26.479]  So what I did is, I did proceed.
[00:43:26.499 --> 00:43:28.061]  Well, for those that don't know, hold on.
[00:43:28.641 --> 00:43:30.742]  Mr. Berg, you're dropping bombshell after bombshell.
[00:43:31.022 --> 00:43:34.382]  So they're not even following proper judicial proceedings.
[00:43:34.843 --> 00:43:40.964]  They've now turned it into a pure kangaroo court with the judge saying, my hands are tied.
[00:43:40.984 --> 00:43:45.325]  I mean, that right there lets us know this is thermal nuclear level.
[00:43:45.565 --> 00:43:48.386]  They're definitely desperate to cover this up.
[00:43:48.976 --> 00:43:50.316]  Well, yes and no on that.
[00:43:50.376 --> 00:43:53.677]  They said, I mean, before me, they said False Claims Act, they can't have input.
[00:43:54.218 --> 00:44:01.960]  Different than the Ninth Circuit in California, because the law, and I'll go along with the Ninth Circuit, because it says that the relator can have a hearing.
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:06.982]  Well, if you're going to have a hearing, and the hearing's in front of a judge, why would you have a hearing with no input from the judge?
[00:44:07.042 --> 00:44:08.002]  It just doesn't make sense.
[00:44:08.522 --> 00:44:10.503]  So he has to recuse himself, but obviously he doesn't.
[00:44:24.947 --> 00:44:25.127]  Right.
[00:44:25.167 --> 00:44:33.112]  We asked him to recuse himself, either appoint me, let me proceed with the case, or if they want further questions about the case, to appoint a special prosecutor.
[00:44:33.612 --> 00:44:38.375]  Their response was, believe it or not, well, Eric Holder hasn't signed any of the pleadings in this case.
[00:44:39.295 --> 00:44:40.556]  Who's your boss, you assistant?
[00:44:40.816 --> 00:44:41.757]  You know what I mean?
[00:44:42.077 --> 00:44:42.797]  Who's your boss?
[00:44:43.298 --> 00:44:45.019]  Is there a conflict of interest in Eric Holder?
[00:44:45.319 --> 00:44:48.921]  Number one, he was on Obama's campaign committee staff.
[00:44:49.341 --> 00:44:54.262]  Okay, Phil, in the time we've got left, because you've got your, again, finger on the pulse of this more than anybody out there,
[00:45:20.643 --> 00:45:28.846]  As best you can tell from your deep research and all your sources out there, what's the real chain of events?
[00:45:29.226 --> 00:45:30.146]  Born in Kenya?
[00:45:30.226 --> 00:45:31.507]  When did he come to the U.S.?
[00:45:32.027 --> 00:45:34.067]  Why is he covering up the college papers?
[00:45:34.688 --> 00:45:36.648]  And where do you see all this going?
[00:45:37.229 --> 00:45:38.429]  How do you see this playing out?
[00:45:39.028 --> 00:45:45.249]  Well, it's going to be tough unless we get the public behind us, because right now the courts aren't getting us, letting us have any discovery.
[00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:52.091]  I mean, the court in Philadelphia, that case which is coming up for its hearing in October, the Third Circuit, deals with the fact that I don't have standing.
[00:45:52.511 --> 00:45:57.632]  With that, for your listeners, they mean I don't have standing, Alex Jones doesn't have standing, and none of you listening to the show has standing.
[00:45:57.712 --> 00:45:58.152]  A U.S.
[00:45:58.172 --> 00:46:01.953]  citizen doesn't have standing to enforce the Constitution, which is asinine.
[00:46:02.353 --> 00:46:03.193]  Isn't that asinine?
[00:46:03.593 --> 00:46:06.234]  Especially under the 10th Amendment, where it goes back to we the people.
[00:46:06.714 --> 00:46:10.635]  The second, the Hollister case is a good case, and we'll try to get him on the air with you.
[00:46:10.976 --> 00:46:18.118]  That's the Air Force colonel saying, can I obey your order, or can I legally disobey your order, because you're a usurper.
[00:46:18.538 --> 00:46:22.499]  And the third one, which is a pressing one, which hopefully we'll be hearing soon on this False Claims Act,
[00:46:23.059 --> 00:46:24.840]  In that case, though, I found a little different.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:34.884]  That was Berg versus Soturo, because I'm claiming in that case that Barry Soturo is an illegal alien, therefore his three and a half years as a U.S.
[00:46:34.904 --> 00:46:39.926]  Senator was a fraud, and therefore his salary and benefits of over a million dollars should come back to the U.S.
[00:46:39.966 --> 00:46:40.406]  Treasury.
[00:46:40.786 --> 00:46:46.589]  So for them not to allow me to proceed, if we proceed in that case, as soon as we get discovery in any case,
[00:46:48.304 --> 00:46:49.865]  Obama will have to be out of office.
[00:46:50.086 --> 00:46:50.786]  I am sure.
[00:46:52.328 --> 00:46:57.533]  Listen, if he was born in Hawaii, he would have produced his vault copy of his birth certificate.
[00:46:57.954 --> 00:47:00.256]  People say the governor saw it, the officials there.
[00:47:00.316 --> 00:47:07.103]  If you look at their statements very carefully, and I'll send you a copy of a letter, you can post it if you want, that I sent to Lou Dobbs to clear his act up.
[00:47:07.983 --> 00:47:12.226]  They never said, they said they saw a birth certificate, they never said it's from Hawaii.
[00:47:12.706 --> 00:47:14.887]  And if it was, they would have said it, you would have seen it.
[00:47:15.307 --> 00:47:20.990]  His records at colleges are sealed because I'm sure it's a show that he applied for and received foreign aid.
[00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:23.391]  I mean, none of, we don't have a medical record.
[00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:24.312]  Well, it's more than that.
[00:47:24.492 --> 00:47:25.953]  I have a copy of my vault.
[00:47:25.993 --> 00:47:26.933]  It's like a blueprint.
[00:47:26.973 --> 00:47:28.894]  It's like stamped on there.
[00:47:29.334 --> 00:47:33.897]  It's not the receipts that everybody gets and uses for regular business.
[00:47:34.537 --> 00:47:35.999]  And it's such a simple thing.
[00:47:36.039 --> 00:47:45.493]  I think everybody, because they have a birth certificate, knows that when they're being shown a receipt and told, you're stupid, this is a birth certificate, that it insults their intelligence.
[00:47:45.513 --> 00:47:49.999]  And then they find out about the Barry Satoro and his dad and the communism and...
[00:47:51.364 --> 00:47:52.265]  Here's the bigger question.
[00:47:52.325 --> 00:47:59.047]  We know, Phil, the establishment isn't going to let somebody in like this, knowing this, unless they plan to use it.
[00:47:59.448 --> 00:48:17.896]  The more I look at it, it looks like they picked him and chose him just because he was so compromised, and they've known this the whole time and just wanted to hold it over his head, and then now you and millions of others are sabotaging their little game plan, and you can say, well, they'll ignore us in the courts,
[00:48:18.636 --> 00:48:30.242]  And, you know, WorldwideElegant put up some billboards, but the issue is, in the court of public opinion, I think this is one of the other things that is destroying him right now.
[00:48:30.363 --> 00:48:36.506]  So, we're going to convict him either way, because he continues to cover up the truth.
[00:48:37.401 --> 00:48:57.397]  I think we're going to force, if we can get the number of people to increase, we can, I hit it, you hit it right on the head, the court of public opinion, we can, if we get, let's say we get 75 million people to follow Alex Jones, Phil Berg, our website, if we can on a certain day say, tomorrow, everyone should call the White House switchboard and demand to see the birth certificate, we can blow out their switchboard.
[00:48:57.778 --> 00:49:00.240]  The next day we can call ABC, NBC, CBS.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.141]  We can ask people to email letters.
[00:49:02.601 --> 00:49:06.724]  We can get very easy, I think it's five or six people, to stand at a major intersection.
[00:49:06.744 --> 00:49:10.847]  He's holding a sign so it spells out, Obama, where is your birth certificate?
[00:49:11.187 --> 00:49:20.193]  At a busy intersection, and we're going to do this off of obamacrimes.com, a busy intersection at rush hour could hit between 5,000 and 20,000 people depending on, you know...
[00:49:20.333 --> 00:49:27.460]  And regardless, this is a practice action in mass mobilization and taking action.
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.582]  This is how we save the country.
[00:49:30.463 --> 00:49:31.864]  Again, I go back to what you said, Phil.
[00:49:32.224 --> 00:49:37.709]  They will not release the original birth certificate and this game of
[00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:43.513]  of telling us that we don't have a right to see it or that we've seen it isn't going to work.
[00:49:43.733 --> 00:49:50.236]  Let's play this clip of this congressman where this one lady gets up and then spontaneously everybody's shouting him down.
[00:49:50.637 --> 00:49:56.180]  This shows this issue is mega viral and this video is scaring the establishment.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.701]  They admit they're scared.
[00:49:58.021 --> 00:50:00.162]  Why are they scared of something that isn't true?
[00:50:00.442 --> 00:50:00.922]  Here it is.
[00:50:00.942 --> 00:50:05.125]  This lady in red has had her hand up for some time.
[00:50:10.046 --> 00:50:10.367]  Thank you.
[00:50:11.289 --> 00:50:18.947]  Congressman Haskell, I want to know, I have a birth certificate here.
[00:50:19.855 --> 00:50:35.243]  From the United States of America saying I'm an American citizen with a seal on it, signed by a doctor, with the hospital administrator's name, my parents, my date of birth, the time, the date.
[00:50:35.263 --> 00:50:48.350]  I want to go back to January 20th and I want to know why are you people ignoring his birth certificate?
[00:50:49.468 --> 00:50:49.728]  Back it up.
[00:50:49.748 --> 00:50:50.950]  We're going to come back and finish it.
[00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:52.652]  Then we're going to take calls in the next segment.
[00:50:53.172 --> 00:50:57.237]  Five minutes after that, then we have another guest coming up to also talk about Obama.
[00:50:57.477 --> 00:50:58.899]  But here's the Rasmussen poll.
[00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:00.160]  He's fallen below 50.
[00:51:02.263 --> 00:51:06.728]  He has the lowest approval rating of any president in modern history at this point in his administration.
[00:51:07.395 --> 00:51:17.482]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:51:17.962 --> 00:51:19.023]  Garden in a Can!

[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.281]  It is a big idea.
[00:52:08.301 --> 00:52:10.423]  A New World Order.
[00:52:11.123 --> 00:52:15.546]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:52:15.626 --> 00:52:18.808]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:18.848 --> 00:52:21.090]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:24.092]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:24.813 --> 00:52:32.138]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:35.154 --> 00:52:40.137]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:52:40.598 --> 00:52:44.080]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.962]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:52:47.042 --> 00:52:48.183]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:48.203 --> 00:52:48.963]  They're not after money.
[00:52:48.983 --> 00:52:50.064]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:50.284 --> 00:52:50.985]  They're after power.
[00:52:51.245 --> 00:52:52.085]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:53:03.913 --> 00:53:04.994]  You have been warned.
[00:53:05.975 --> 00:53:08.917]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:53:09.077 --> 00:53:14.300]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:19.944]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:53:20.344 --> 00:53:21.425]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:21.805 --> 00:53:30.691]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:31.091]  Yes.
[00:53:31.111 --> 00:53:32.732]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:53:32.953 --> 00:53:37.116]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:54:20.254 --> 00:54:21.775]  With a seal on it.
[00:54:22.215 --> 00:54:23.576]  Signed by a doctor.
[00:54:24.037 --> 00:54:26.458]  With the hospital administrator's name.
[00:54:26.738 --> 00:54:29.900]  My parents, my date of birth, the time, the date.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:39.366]  I want to go back to January 20th and I want to know why are you people ignoring his birth certificate?
[00:55:18.083 --> 00:55:22.826]  If you're referring to the president there, he is a citizen of the United States.
[00:55:22.846 --> 00:55:33.312]  I don't know if he really is a citizen of the United States.
[00:55:34.553 --> 00:55:35.313]  Where did it start?
[00:55:41.695 --> 00:55:47.477]  Alright, folks.
[00:55:48.338 --> 00:55:48.838]  That's enough.
[00:55:49.178 --> 00:55:52.239]  You can watch the rest of it up on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:52.279 --> 00:55:58.021]  In fact, show folks a smaller bubble of that video so they can see the title of it and find it for themselves on YouTube or on the web.
[00:55:58.041 --> 00:56:02.603]  It's titled, uh, McCassell on Peebo's birth certificate.
[00:56:03.123 --> 00:56:05.644]  Now, the issue here
[00:56:07.711 --> 00:56:09.234]  I mean, this one version has 700,000 views.
[00:56:09.254 --> 00:56:10.256]  Or to be technical, 697,000 views.
[00:56:10.277 --> 00:56:11.840]  The issue here
[00:56:17.051 --> 00:56:24.898]  This is what's scaring the establishment, is they all start chanting and standing up and screaming at him in a spontaneous verbal riot, almost.
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:29.702]  I think that shows the numbers are bigger than 25 million people.
[00:56:29.722 --> 00:56:38.931]  You've had a random congressional event with Congressman Castle that the majority, and I'm watching those people closely, get up and are screaming.
[00:56:40.732 --> 00:56:42.577]  And you notice he said he is a citizen.
[00:56:42.917 --> 00:56:45.824]  Yeah, you can be a citizen and be born in Austria.
[00:56:46.185 --> 00:56:49.212]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is a citizen, but he's not eligible to be president.
[00:56:49.252 --> 00:56:49.733]  Phil Berg.
[00:56:52.406 --> 00:57:07.083]  Growing bigger and bigger because they don't know how to respond and they're all saying that we've seen the birth certificate and if we get the word out they haven't seen the birth certificate and the reason they won't show the birth certificate, if they show it he's done because the birth certificate will show he was born in Kenya.
[00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:12.490]  I have on our website the paternal grandmother Sarah Obama's statement in Swahili.
[00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.931]  Why doesn't he take care?
[00:57:13.951 --> 00:57:15.752]  Why doesn't he take care of all his family?
[00:57:15.772 --> 00:57:17.173]  I got family that I help out some.
[00:57:17.193 --> 00:57:18.114]  He doesn't even care about brothers.
[00:57:18.174 --> 00:57:19.555]  He doesn't care about grandmothers.
[00:57:19.575 --> 00:57:22.537]  I mean, that right there, boy, this is not a very compassionate person.
[00:57:42.363 --> 00:57:43.843]  Well, his aunt is living in Boston.
[00:57:43.883 --> 00:57:52.565]  I tried to visit with her, but she wouldn't talk to me up in Boston, who's here an avid illegal alien, and I think that's the same status as Obama.
[00:57:52.825 --> 00:57:55.326]  His half-brother's living in Kenya on a dollar a month.
[00:57:55.806 --> 00:58:01.027]  I mean, he gave supposedly Odinga, his cousin over there, he gave over a million dollars.
[00:58:01.647 --> 00:58:08.729]  Odinga lost the election, but then he burned down churches with people in it, and they finally put him in office to stop some of the
[00:58:11.447 --> 00:58:12.967]  And that's the other issue.
[00:58:12.987 --> 00:58:14.328]  You're not just saying that, Phil.
[00:58:14.388 --> 00:58:20.731]  I mean, the Senate letters from Obama advising how to riot, he's like a savage revolutionary.
[00:58:21.292 --> 00:58:23.313]  My God, he's setting up a dictatorship.
[00:58:23.353 --> 00:58:24.693]  Phil, stay there five more minutes.
[00:58:24.713 --> 00:58:27.335]  We'll take a few calls from William, David, Ron, and Daniel.
[00:58:27.355 --> 00:58:29.116]  I have quick questions, folks, for Phil Byrd.
[00:58:29.136 --> 00:58:31.957]  We're going to have Phil Byrd back up again next week.
[00:58:32.057 --> 00:58:36.560]  And yes, the last interview for the new Obama film is Phil Byrd.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.541]  We're going to interview him this weekend.
[00:58:39.381 --> 00:58:42.323]  So that will be in the new film as well.
[00:58:42.683 --> 00:58:43.644]  This is huge.
[00:58:44.104 --> 00:58:47.026]  Stay with us.
[00:58:47.046 --> 00:58:52.109]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:55.992]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:56.872 --> 00:59:01.855]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:59:02.056 --> 00:59:02.596]  Number one,
[00:59:02.856 --> 00:59:05.857]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:59:06.097 --> 00:59:06.317]  Number 2.
[00:59:06.777 --> 00:59:11.698]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:11.999 --> 00:59:12.439]  It's true.
[00:59:12.639 --> 00:59:16.840]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:17.560]  Number 3.
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:23.422]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:59:23.602 --> 00:59:23.822]  Number 4.
[00:59:24.262 --> 00:59:26.923]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:30.584]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:30.824 --> 00:59:31.044]  Number 5.
[00:59:31.684 --> 00:59:35.328]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:59:35.528 --> 00:59:41.033]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:59:41.274 --> 00:59:45.838]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:00:02.087 --> 01:00:04.892]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:20.971]  Obama's approval rating plunging.
[01:00:20.991 --> 01:00:28.615]  No president, even Jimmy Carter or George W. Bush, went down to below 50 in the first 7-8 months.
[01:00:28.795 --> 01:00:29.655]  This is an all-time low.
[01:00:29.695 --> 01:00:31.136]  We'll cover that later.
[01:00:31.656 --> 01:00:34.858]  Take a few calls here.
[01:00:34.878 --> 01:00:37.559]  We're having backup next week so you can talk to him more.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.620]  For Phil Berg, Obamacrimes.com.
[01:00:40.961 --> 01:00:43.302]  William in Delaware, you're on the air with Phil Berg.
[01:00:43.362 --> 01:00:43.662]  Go ahead.
[01:00:44.784 --> 01:00:49.427]  I want to thank Phil for taking on the legal aspect of this whole situation.
[01:00:49.807 --> 01:00:59.492]  And Alex, I want to thank you and Jason and Luke out there for showing me what a powerful weapon that video camera is.
[01:00:59.913 --> 01:01:05.576]  Because without that, there wasn't anybody else down there that day actually recording this stuff.
[01:01:06.196 --> 01:01:16.087]  And I stuck four or five different videos from the footage that I got there that day and put them out there and that one just took off.
[01:01:16.388 --> 01:01:17.729]  Wait, wait, the footage of what?
[01:01:17.809 --> 01:01:18.991]  Footage of Phil Berg?
[01:01:20.123 --> 01:01:25.571]  No, I'm the creator of the woman in the red shirt video here in Delaware.
[01:01:25.591 --> 01:01:26.913]  Wow, what a small world.
[01:01:26.993 --> 01:01:31.520]  So you're saying, you're saying you're one of my listeners, you learned from us.
[01:01:31.801 --> 01:01:35.747]  I'm an official info warrior, Alex, and I'm proud to be one.
[01:01:36.227 --> 01:01:43.093]  Well, and now this thing's got millions and millions of views, hundreds of different versions, some of them 700, some of them 500,000 views apiece.
[01:01:43.473 --> 01:01:53.441]  Phil, how exciting that the guy that shot the video, hey, what was it like seeing this huge spontaneous awakening where, I mean, you were in that crowd.
[01:01:53.481 --> 01:01:57.765]  It looks like from the video that like 80, 90 percent of the people are yelling, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:58.005 --> 01:01:59.386]  I mean, what did you see?
[01:01:59.607 --> 01:02:00.607]  It was about that.
[01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:02.448]  ...stage for this thing.
[01:02:02.948 --> 01:02:07.630]  This was a town hall listening tour that was going to be about healthcare.
[01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:13.111]  He put it three days after his vote for cap-and-trade.
[01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:19.353]  Eighty to ninety percent of the people that were there were there because of his vote for that cap-and-trade bill.
[01:02:19.991 --> 01:02:29.098]  Well listen, William, I want to say right now, we will put it in the film if you will send us the footage of that lady and make the point because it'd be higher quality.
[01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:33.642]  Can I put you on hold and give you our FedEx number and will you let us use that in the new Obama film?
[01:02:34.486 --> 01:02:37.568]  Absolutely, and I've got one other thing to plug.
[01:02:37.968 --> 01:02:47.995]  After the meeting, I got up one-on-one with Mike Castle, and the audio is not great on it, but it's actually posted as a video response to this first one.
[01:02:48.775 --> 01:02:54.159]  And I'm asking him about the forced vaccination bill, whether he would vote for it.
[01:02:54.479 --> 01:03:01.604]  He flip-flops on it, and eventually at the end he says yes, under certain circumstances he would vote to forcibly vaccinate us.
[01:03:03.566 --> 01:03:08.177]  And it wouldn't be a violation of the Fourth Amendment, which frankly I think is disgusting.
[01:03:09.079 --> 01:03:10.040]  This is incredible.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.120]  You know what, William?
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:22.167]  I'm going to put you on hold right now, get your name and number, and I'm going to call you in a little while and give you our FedEx number, but I'd like to have you on for maybe 10-15 minutes next time.
[01:03:22.187 --> 01:03:25.289]  Next week, we do two hours on this subject.
[01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:31.673]  But look, every time I turn around, it is our listeners that are trailblazing on every big issue.
[01:03:32.394 --> 01:03:33.855]  William, you warm my heart.
[01:03:33.915 --> 01:03:34.815]  You made my day.
[01:03:34.855 --> 01:03:35.436]  God bless you.
[01:03:36.198 --> 01:03:42.359]  Hey, thanks Alex, and I also want to put a plug out to the Oath Keepers, because I'm constantly pushing those guys for our troops.
[01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:44.540]  We'll do that, but we've got to say bye.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.500]  Look, I'll just have you back on.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.740]  Get his name and number, John.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.921]  Phil, I'm going to have you back up next week.
[01:03:50.961 --> 01:04:00.903]  My team's coming up this weekend to interview you for the film, but in closing, and I meant to get to other calls, but that caller, look at what a small world it is that it's one of our listeners that did that.
[01:04:01.448 --> 01:04:02.108]  That's wonderful.
[01:04:02.548 --> 01:04:08.411]  Yeah, now the big thing is, if everyone can go to my website and send it to everyone on their address book, obamacrimes.com.
[01:04:08.771 --> 01:04:13.872]  Listeners, go to it, send it to everyone on your address book, and ask them to send it on and on and on.
[01:04:14.293 --> 01:04:16.754]  And if you can make a contribution to us, it's costly.
[01:04:17.094 --> 01:04:19.194]  We want to get sign boards up that mean something.
[01:04:19.214 --> 01:04:21.995]  We want signs going up, Obama, where's your birth certificate?
[01:04:22.396 --> 01:04:28.938]  We want to have bumper stickers with, or metallic things you can put on the side of your car saying, Obama, where's your birth certificate?
[01:04:29.338 --> 01:04:32.759]  Not this easy way out thing, where's your birth certificate, doesn't do it.
[01:04:32.779 --> 01:04:35.340]  So Obamacrimes.com is the place to go, everyone.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.560]  Absolutely.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.701]  People should support you.
[01:04:37.721 --> 01:04:39.281]  You're doing invaluable work.
[01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:48.224]  And I want to have you on next week for an hour or more with the colonel who you're representing, and to cover a lot more at Obamacrimes.com.
[01:04:48.824 --> 01:04:55.906]  Mr. Berg, thank you so much for spending time with us, and I'm going to have my producer call you in about 20 minutes to lock down that interview time.
[01:04:58.137 --> 01:04:58.417]  You bet.
[01:04:58.457 --> 01:04:58.877]  Take care.
[01:04:58.977 --> 01:05:02.659]  Our website's InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV.

[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.661]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:05:07.941 --> 01:05:09.722]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:05:09.922 --> 01:05:10.542]  Well, you should.

[01:05:40.456 --> 01:05:45.639]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[01:06:06.957 --> 01:06:08.518]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:08.618 --> 01:06:13.300]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:16.122]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:06:16.322 --> 01:06:19.204]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:06:19.364 --> 01:06:25.227]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:06:25.447 --> 01:06:28.389]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:06:28.689 --> 01:06:35.594]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:06:35.674 --> 01:06:38.816]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:06:38.956 --> 01:06:40.837]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:44.099 --> 01:06:50.181]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[01:06:54.142 --> 01:06:55.463]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:06:55.483 --> 01:06:56.083]  Take action today.
[01:06:56.103 --> 01:06:57.924]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:07:06.954 --> 01:07:07.894]  A guy named M.Z.
[01:07:07.934 --> 01:07:11.095]  in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:07:11.315 --> 01:07:13.736]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:07:13.876 --> 01:07:14.636]  He was devastated.
[01:07:14.756 --> 01:07:23.419]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life, that even when you do a great job for someone, and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:07:23.559 --> 01:07:29.440]  You are always in danger of losing your job, unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:32.261]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:07:32.461 --> 01:07:33.281]  So M.Z.
[01:07:33.321 --> 01:07:34.822]  has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[01:07:35.902 --> 01:07:36.122]  I think so.
[01:07:58.664 --> 01:07:59.986]  OwnMyself.com.
[01:08:00.146 --> 01:08:03.750]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:06.473]  Remember, Chocolate.OwnMyself.com.
[01:08:07.093 --> 01:08:12.179]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:12.499 --> 01:08:14.782]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:26.272 --> 01:08:33.737]  Well, it's ATLAH Worldwide, and he has millions of people that listen to his sermons and watch what he has to do.
[01:08:33.757 --> 01:08:40.621]  He's a very popular pastor, Reverend James Manning, the chief pastor at ATLAH World Missionary Church.
[01:08:40.721 --> 01:08:50.707]  Manning graduated from the College of New Rochelle with a Bachelor of Arts degree, continued to the Union Theological Seminary in the city of New York, where he is awarded Master of Divinity.
[01:08:51.047 --> 01:08:53.149]  Manning also holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree,
[01:08:54.209 --> 01:09:08.601]  From Theology Seminary and unaccredited educational institution, Manning achieved some controversy in the 2008 presidential election after he posted several sermons of his that were harshly critical of Democratic candidate Barack Obama on the website YouTube.
[01:09:08.621 --> 01:09:14.125]  So that's kind of the view of him from Wikipedia, but you never know about Wikipedia.
[01:09:14.165 --> 01:09:17.728]  They got my name spelled wrong and half the stuff on there is a lie about me.
[01:09:18.008 --> 01:09:22.612]  So we have the man himself who I think is very focused, articulate, and also very angry
[01:09:23.928 --> 01:09:27.914]  In fact, early on he was really critical of Obama, and I wasn't sure about Obama.
[01:09:28.374 --> 01:09:37.687]  You know, I wasn't a big fan of Bush, and a lot of stuff Obama said he wanted to do, I agreed with, but then he's lied about everything, and now his approval rating's gone from 84
[01:09:39.429 --> 01:09:43.470]  In a Rasmussen poll to 49, nobody's has ever fallen that fast.
[01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:47.911]  Now it's coming out that the majority of people think he was really born in Kenya.
[01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:49.372]  He's such a liar.
[01:09:49.432 --> 01:09:50.472]  Who knows if that's true?
[01:09:50.492 --> 01:09:52.172]  We just covered it with Mr. Berg earlier.
[01:09:52.392 --> 01:09:54.173]  They won't release the original birth certificate.
[01:09:54.893 --> 01:09:57.354]  Anybody who criticizes him gets called a racist.
[01:09:57.734 --> 01:09:59.794]  It's creating all this racial division.
[01:10:01.315 --> 01:10:03.915]  And this is getting really scary.
[01:10:04.436 --> 01:10:05.316]  So I wanted to get
[01:10:06.666 --> 01:10:13.675]  The view from a critical black American pastor of Barack Obama on multi-fronts.
[01:10:13.715 --> 01:10:15.838]  We've had people on, black Americans who like him.
[01:10:16.139 --> 01:10:18.482]  We have people like KRS-One, Hip Hop Sensation.
[01:10:18.762 --> 01:10:22.087]  Day One said, I see a scam coming a mile away.
[01:10:22.948 --> 01:10:32.930]  And as I said when Obama first got elected, I said, I feel bad because when it turns out that this guy is a fraud like most politicians, it's going to be turned into a racial issue.
[01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:37.731]  So to give us his take on this is a fellow who's ended up being all over Fox, CNN, you name it.
[01:10:38.251 --> 01:10:39.371]  Quite a big controversy.
[01:10:41.012 --> 01:10:43.512]  Dr. James David Manning.
[01:10:43.832 --> 01:10:46.133]  Pastor, it's good to have you on here with us, sir.
[01:10:47.193 --> 01:10:49.214]  Well, Alex, it's good to be here as well.
[01:10:50.535 --> 01:10:53.216]  I'm really honored to be on your broadcast.
[01:10:53.837 --> 01:10:59.480]  I've heard a lot about you, and I've seen what they've done to you on YouTube.
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:03.642]  I've heard all about it, but I'm glad to be on the broadcast today.
[01:11:03.962 --> 01:11:04.983]  Let me also add this.
[01:11:05.263 --> 01:11:14.668]  I am traveling, and I'm not in my office, and so I had to stop at a restaurant to make this call, so you may hear some exterior noises.
[01:11:15.228 --> 01:11:16.149]  I totally understand.
[01:11:16.169 --> 01:11:18.010]  You're on the road, came on on short notice.
[01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:20.532]  We'll have you back up from the studio in the near future.
[01:11:20.792 --> 01:11:21.753]  You've got the floor, sir.
[01:11:23.054 --> 01:11:26.456]  Well, again, you know, your intro kind of says it all.
[01:11:26.476 --> 01:11:37.865]  I was very much aware of Obama from day one, if you will, checking out him as a person, what his spirit was all about.
[01:11:39.183 --> 01:11:48.606]  Uh, and was able to deal with that, but I first began to try to deal with the African American or black community, whatever it is that, you know, black folks prefer to be called.
[01:11:48.626 --> 01:11:55.349]  Um, I realized who he was and that the presidential campaign was underway.
[01:11:55.369 --> 01:12:06.873]  Uh, I tried to say to the black folk, um, especially since the church, the Lord has let me pastor for the last 27 years is in Harlem, New York.
[01:12:08.035 --> 01:12:22.906]  And of course, black folk have been so enamored with Bill Clinton and labeled him, uh, Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou had stated that he was the first black president, no black president could ever be better than Bill Clinton.
[01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:37.336]  And then, of course, back in 2001, the Black Caucus, Congressional Caucus of the Black Congress, got together and put together a resolution there in the House determining that Bill Clinton was the first black president.
[01:12:38.256 --> 01:12:44.098]  And then I saw them turning from their commitment to the Clintons to Obama.
[01:12:44.238 --> 01:12:46.319]  And I am not a Clinton supporter.
[01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:50.921]  I was very much against Clinton, but the entire eight years he was in office,
[01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:54.405]  People just didn't pick up on me the way they did with Obama.
[01:12:55.045 --> 01:13:09.001]  But I was trying to say to the black people in Harlem and nationwide that it represented a sense of absence of loyalty, the absence of integrity, and it just kind of mushroomed from there as I began to watch the campaign unfold.
[01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:19.593]  Well, atlah.org, A-T-L-A-H dot O-R-G is the website where folks can actually watch and listen to the unedited sermons.
[01:13:19.913 --> 01:13:26.134]  The mainstream media has taken out of context and kind of boiled down and misrepresented some of what you've said.
[01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:34.997]  Here in your own words, sir, because it's got international attention, what is your basic take on Obama, what he's done, where this is going?
[01:13:35.837 --> 01:13:45.282]  I found sermons of you nine, ten, eleven months ago saying this is going to end in disaster, when the media was acting like Jesus had returned and we were all saved.
[01:13:45.942 --> 01:13:52.005]  How did you instinctively, or I guess spiritually, or from research, know this was going to end so bad?
[01:13:52.045 --> 01:13:57.427]  Because it really is, I'm following the trajectory, he is falling like a shooting star right now.
[01:13:58.828 --> 01:14:02.550]  Well, I was spiritually aware of him, Alex.
[01:14:03.695 --> 01:14:04.396]  Early on.
[01:14:05.356 --> 01:14:21.508]  Biblically, from the time I was a young boy growing up down in North Carolina, hearing the preachers preach about one that was going to come and would purport to solve all the world's problems.
[01:14:22.228 --> 01:14:37.453]  And that the world would be so enamored and in love with him that they would indeed worship him, and that he would be extremely charismatic, that he would be, you know, he would be handsome and the whole world would bow down before him.
[01:14:38.114 --> 01:14:50.338]  I heard these sermons preached years ago when I was just a boy, and when Obama came, I realized that he fit the bill of the sermons that had been preached.
[01:14:51.133 --> 01:15:00.457]  Uh, he was early, he was early about preachers who had no idea who this person would be, what race they would come from, or even what period in which he would show up.
[01:15:00.497 --> 01:15:04.258]  Now, are you saying he's a prototype, as the Bible says, mini-Antichrist spirit?
[01:15:04.278 --> 01:15:05.979]  Or are you saying he could be the big one?
[01:15:06.739 --> 01:15:08.060]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:10.221]  That is exactly what I'm saying.
[01:15:11.979 --> 01:15:25.263]  And while you're right about his following the trajectory of Obama's rise and fall, he has fallen in points over the last couple of weeks, more specifically.
[01:15:25.883 --> 01:15:39.367]  But Alex, I'll say this to you, and be well advised, that the grip that Obama has on the world, the grip that Obama has on the white liberals, if you don't mind...
[01:15:41.323 --> 01:15:45.065]  The grip that Obama has on the black people will not win.
[01:15:45.485 --> 01:15:47.746]  Now he has lost some points to be sure.
[01:15:48.546 --> 01:15:52.488]  Media has done just a little bit of a turn on him, not much.
[01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:54.349]  Not enough to make a real difference.
[01:15:54.689 --> 01:15:56.430]  As you know, they worship this man.
[01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:57.771]  I mean, they really do.
[01:15:57.791 --> 01:16:03.373]  But you're saying he can certainly pull some rabbits out of hats and stage some crises.
[01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:05.294]  So where do you see this going with Obama?
[01:16:05.534 --> 01:16:06.375]  What's the bottom line?
[01:16:07.419 --> 01:16:13.462]  I see it going into a revolution or a civil war in America.
[01:16:13.862 --> 01:16:15.603]  That's exactly what's on the agenda.
[01:16:16.323 --> 01:16:18.424]  And that's the only thing that's going to get our nation back.
[01:16:18.484 --> 01:16:22.486]  You are not going to get this nation back from Obama through the vote.
[01:16:22.626 --> 01:16:23.547]  I can tell you that now.
[01:16:23.907 --> 01:16:28.989]  Through putting in Congresspersons, putting in Senators, and rearranging the House in 2010.
[01:16:29.029 --> 01:16:33.071]  You are not going to take this nation back from Obama.
[01:16:33.452 --> 01:16:36.293]  He has deeply implanted inside
[01:16:36.893 --> 01:16:40.935]  People in strategic locations, offices, etc.
[01:16:41.375 --> 01:16:45.937]  that will make it not impossible to take this nation back.
[01:16:46.098 --> 01:16:47.178]  It's gonna have to be.
[01:16:47.258 --> 01:16:55.122]  Well that's the thing, is that he is federally seizing giant corporations, having Homeland Security take over all the federal agencies.
[01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:58.964]  He's seizing, he really is grabbing control of everything.
[01:16:59.244 --> 01:17:01.685]  So even if people wake up, it won't matter.
[01:17:02.045 --> 01:17:05.747]  So you're saying he's gonna attempt to set up a dictatorship?
[01:17:06.584 --> 01:17:13.507]  The only thing that he has not done yet, he has done, we've seen the seizing of General Motors, he wants health care.
[01:17:13.547 --> 01:17:21.571]  Now, if he can get health care, one-sixth of the American economy, and then he controls everybody's lives.
[01:17:21.712 --> 01:17:34.338]  Senator Orrin had said the other day in the Senate Finance Committee, what they were trying to put together to present to Obama, the long-legged mackdaddy, that's what I call him, that he was so ticked off
[01:17:34.938 --> 01:17:40.122]  With what they were strategizing to do there in that Senate Finance Committee, he walked out of there.
[01:17:40.242 --> 01:17:49.088]  And what he said, and it did not mince his words, what he said was that they were really trying to propose a plan that would be a government takeover.
[01:17:49.368 --> 01:17:55.332]  They're not looking just for healthcare for the 46 million people that don't have healthcare.
[01:17:55.532 --> 01:18:01.796]  Obama wants a complete government takeover of the entire healthcare industry.
[01:18:02.056 --> 01:18:04.538]  At that point, he says, who lives, who dies.
[01:18:04.738 --> 01:18:09.381]  Well look at the cap and trade, where the feds can take over any business or even private home.
[01:18:09.761 --> 01:18:13.083]  That's in the bill, and then Obama lies and says it isn't in there.
[01:18:13.103 --> 01:18:14.884]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:18:15.444 --> 01:18:30.793]  Well if you give him cap and trade, where he controls the energy, he can control any business, walk into any business, shut it down at any time he wants, or funnel billions of federal dollars into any business he wants to funnel it into, how are you going to get him out by voting?
[01:18:30.813 --> 01:18:31.553]  You can't do that.
[01:18:31.593 --> 01:18:32.974]  I mean, he'll control everything.
[01:18:33.454 --> 01:18:49.424]  The only thing he hasn't started doing yet, which I suspect will happen in not too many days or months, will be the beginning of the arresting of people or people being pursued by IRS investigations or whatever.
[01:18:49.624 --> 01:18:50.665]  That's next on the horizon.
[01:18:50.745 --> 01:19:05.405]  Well, Pastor, actually, during the campaign, you probably know in Missouri and other states, they would go on the news and say, if you lie about him, and we're going to decide, no judge or jury, the police are going to arrest you, and now they're trying to pass the hate crimes law, where they arrest you for your speech!
[01:19:06.257 --> 01:19:07.277]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:07.557 --> 01:19:08.398]  That's next.
[01:19:08.838 --> 01:19:11.219]  That's one of the things I'm concerned about.
[01:19:11.679 --> 01:19:19.001]  You know, as I preach and speak, I mean, I'm a prime candidate to be hauled off to jail.
[01:19:19.041 --> 01:19:23.742]  I mean, to kick my door in in the middle of the night and take me off the gym and nobody know where I'm at.
[01:19:24.142 --> 01:19:25.343]  You know, that's coming.
[01:19:25.363 --> 01:19:32.225]  Listen, we cannot, anybody who thinks, if you're an American, you've been around American politics at the time, if you think
[01:19:32.885 --> 01:19:38.170]  That this nation is not headed for a confrontation revolution.
[01:19:39.272 --> 01:19:45.438]  If you think that this nation can be taken back from Obama with just voting him out, you've got another thing coming.
[01:19:45.478 --> 01:19:46.639]  I can't imagine where you're at.
[01:19:46.779 --> 01:19:54.407]  This has got to go to the American people rising up and saying, we're not taking this yet, we're going to take our nation back.
[01:19:55.999 --> 01:19:58.600]  All right, Pastor Manning, stay there.
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.881]  We've got a final second with you.
[01:19:59.921 --> 01:20:03.002]  How you see this revolution unfolding.
[01:20:03.482 --> 01:20:04.222]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:04.242 --> 01:20:04.682]  Stay with us.
[01:20:07.423 --> 01:20:08.824]  It is a big idea.
[01:20:08.844 --> 01:20:10.965]  A new world order.
[01:20:11.665 --> 01:20:16.467]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:16.567 --> 01:20:19.368]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:19.408 --> 01:20:21.649]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:22.169 --> 01:20:24.570]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:25.342 --> 01:20:32.681]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:40.680]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:41.141 --> 01:20:44.623]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:45.003 --> 01:20:47.485]  Build America to make great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:47.585 --> 01:20:48.726]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:48.746 --> 01:20:49.526]  They're not after money.
[01:20:49.546 --> 01:20:50.607]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:50.807 --> 01:20:51.528]  They're after power.
[01:20:51.788 --> 01:20:52.628]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:21:08.658 --> 01:21:09.118]  Yeah.
[01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:24.001]  Aerial spraying, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.

[01:23:06.317 --> 01:23:13.141]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:23:13.442 --> 01:23:29.392]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:23:29.652 --> 01:23:34.795]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:23:35.015 --> 01:23:41.281]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:23:41.541 --> 01:23:45.164]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:23:45.425 --> 01:23:48.007]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:53.492]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:23:53.792 --> 01:23:56.394]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:23:56.454 --> 01:23:58.655]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:23:58.695 --> 01:24:01.137]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:24:01.177 --> 01:24:05.560]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[01:24:08.142 --> 01:24:10.563]  Alright, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:10.583 --> 01:24:13.825]  We'll have Dr. Reverend James Manning up for a full hour in the near future.
[01:24:13.846 --> 01:24:14.746]  He's on the road today.
[01:24:17.955 --> 01:24:20.856]  Sir, you've got the floor for the last five minutes of this segment, quick segment.
[01:24:20.876 --> 01:24:31.541]  We were talking intensely during the break about how he came from nowhere, all those points you made, now his actions, now the police state, and what you see happening in America.
[01:24:31.581 --> 01:24:31.941]  Go ahead.
[01:24:33.263 --> 01:24:50.912]  Obama's rise to power has never had a person, no one has ever in the history of this nation risen as quickly as Obama and has become the most powerful man in the world and we don't even know where he was born.
[01:24:51.112 --> 01:24:52.833]  We don't know where he was born.
[01:24:53.133 --> 01:24:54.954]  We don't know who his father is.
[01:24:55.214 --> 01:24:56.294]  We really don't know.
[01:24:56.334 --> 01:24:57.695]  Now we've gotten reports
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:02.942]  But this man, at present, is the most powerful man on this planet.
[01:25:03.302 --> 01:25:19.290]  And right now, I've stated some time ago, that Hitler's power was nothing compared to Obama's power, because Germany was not as a powerful nation during the time of the social democratic status of Germany and Hitler.
[01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:24.653]  America is a mega-nation, and Obama has all this power.
[01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:27.534]  If Hitler had all this power, my God, the Earth would be
[01:25:27.594 --> 01:25:29.575]  10,000 nukes, yeah.
[01:25:29.675 --> 01:25:31.237]  Obama's got 10,000 nukes.
[01:25:31.857 --> 01:25:35.359]  There is nobody, there has never been a situation such as this.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:39.522]  His birth certificate, whether he's a U.S.
[01:25:39.562 --> 01:25:42.324]  citizen or not, everybody knows that he isn't.
[01:25:42.785 --> 01:25:43.945]  Everybody knows that he isn't.
[01:25:43.985 --> 01:25:45.907]  That's another thing we'll have to talk about at another point.
[01:25:45.927 --> 01:25:52.431]  So are you saying early on in your spirit, because I know you did videos when he wasn't even, I mean you were saying you were worried about him day one.
[01:25:52.451 --> 01:25:53.292]  Was that in your gut?
[01:25:56.190 --> 01:26:00.215]  What do you see happening in the future dealing with martial law and revolution?
[01:26:01.857 --> 01:26:04.818]  I want to say to your audience, Alex, I am not an alarmist.
[01:26:04.998 --> 01:26:06.359]  I am not some person.
[01:26:06.719 --> 01:26:09.160]  I'm not Chicken Little, the sky is falling.
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.781]  I pray that people don't perceive me that way.
[01:26:11.801 --> 01:26:14.143]  I've been a pastor for 27 years.
[01:26:14.163 --> 01:26:20.105]  I've served the Harlem community with the earnestness of my love and my love for Jesus.
[01:26:20.165 --> 01:26:28.229]  I'm preaching the gospel, but martial law, the arresting of people, the reason why all of these things are going to happen
[01:26:29.893 --> 01:26:41.297]  Many Americans across America are beginning to realize that we are facing, or we have at present, the most diabolical person sitting in the Oval Office.
[01:26:41.737 --> 01:26:48.119]  There are people in this nation who are going to rise up, and they're forming right now in small groups.
[01:26:48.946 --> 01:26:49.667]  All right.
[01:27:02.982 --> 01:27:16.352]  An event such as 9-11 or some other event in America can give Obama sweeping powers to shut down the Constitution, to shut down all agencies, and arrest or imprison anybody he wants.
[01:27:16.492 --> 01:27:18.454]  Are you saying he may stage something?
[01:27:19.927 --> 01:27:30.233]  I'm saying it's possible if he feels that the matter of the American people is strong enough in resentment to begin to destroy him, to pull him down, I think that he will.
[01:27:30.573 --> 01:27:43.140]  And the other thing that we need to know that I have not said, and I'm saying this for the very first time on your broadcast, I don't mean to be self-promoting anything, as God gives it to me, I want to say it, is that we have not, Alex, we have not
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:55.105]  We have not really began to phantom how diabolical this man is, that if he sees himself going down, that he'll take the world down with him.
[01:27:55.125 --> 01:28:06.990]  Listen, we are looking at a narcissistic, we're looking at a man who is so, I suppose, hung up on himself, so diabolical, that he would not hesitate
[01:28:07.828 --> 01:28:08.389]  I think so.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:21.961]  To destroy this nation.
[01:28:22.281 --> 01:28:26.905]  That is to say, to create a major world crisis, and it would go out in flames.
[01:28:27.205 --> 01:28:28.146]  If you understand what I'm saying.
[01:28:28.266 --> 01:28:45.939]  I know that sounds a bit... No, no, I understand, sir, and it looks like they're setting that up with the economic crisis, the staged flu, all this stuff is really concerning me, and it does look like revolutions in the air to all this, and it seems like they want people to rebel.
[01:28:46.239 --> 01:28:49.942]  It seems like they want... I mean, they're clearly going for broke right now.
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:29:02.432]  The thing that Obama, though in his brilliance, realizes, because he is maniacal and diabolical and insidious, is that he cannot deal with it.
[01:29:02.752 --> 01:29:06.516]  But the truth of the matter is, is America is a great nation.
[01:29:06.636 --> 01:29:09.720]  It's a nation that God Almighty has blessed.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:14.663]  And Americans are going to stand up again and put their lives on the line.
[01:29:15.003 --> 01:29:20.226]  And in order for him to deal with that, it's going to result in the things that we're discussing at present.
[01:29:20.506 --> 01:29:27.890]  But what I want to say in that statement is that this is a strong nation and it's going to rise up against Obama.
[01:29:29.150 --> 01:29:31.452]  Alright, well God bless you Dr. James Manning.
[01:29:31.892 --> 01:29:37.095]  atlah.org, A-T-L-A-H dot O-R-G, or just Google.
[01:29:38.598 --> 01:29:40.879]  James David Manning, and you will find it.
[01:29:40.919 --> 01:29:44.739]  We'll talk to you for a full hour when you get back off the road, back to Harlem.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.740]  God bless you, sir, and it was good speaking with you.
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:47.940]  God bless you.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.261]  I was honored to be on your show.
[01:29:49.521 --> 01:29:50.741]  Thank you so very much for having me.
[01:29:51.081 --> 01:29:51.741]  Honored to have you.
[01:29:51.761 --> 01:29:55.182]  I just am attracted to the pastor's spirit.
[01:29:56.122 --> 01:29:56.542]  Good guy.
[01:29:57.142 --> 01:29:58.063]  We're on the march.
[01:29:58.543 --> 01:30:00.143]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.063 --> 01:30:03.744]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:06.556 --> 01:30:11.743]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:30:11.863 --> 01:30:16.229]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:30:16.389 --> 01:30:18.252]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:30:18.672 --> 01:30:20.014]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:30:20.294 --> 01:30:21.316]  There is a solution.
[01:30:21.556 --> 01:30:29.582]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:31:06.596 --> 01:31:10.580]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.622]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:31:12.842 --> 01:31:21.130]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:31:21.370 --> 01:31:26.595]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:31:26.915 --> 01:31:28.537]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:31:28.757 --> 01:31:35.098]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:31:35.278 --> 01:31:46.040]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:46.840]  That's right.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.400]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[01:32:07.126 --> 01:32:07.667]  You worry.
[01:32:07.807 --> 01:32:09.888]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:32:10.148 --> 01:32:10.428]  Hi.
[01:32:10.708 --> 01:32:13.170]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:17.732]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:20.213]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:32:20.493 --> 01:32:23.535]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:32:23.835 --> 01:32:25.556]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:32:25.776 --> 01:32:28.298]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:32:28.558 --> 01:32:31.981]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:32:32.281 --> 01:32:36.383]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:32:36.704 --> 01:32:40.486]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:32:40.786 --> 01:32:46.790]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:32:47.131 --> 01:32:49.272]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:32:49.492 --> 01:32:51.133]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[01:32:54.115 --> 01:32:55.777]  888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:56.878]  Start now.
[01:32:57.158 --> 01:32:58.099]  Knowledge is power.
[01:32:58.859 --> 01:32:59.680]  Better take action.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:00.901]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:33:00.921 --> 01:33:11.629]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side
[01:33:24.575 --> 01:33:30.982]  You know, I asked Willie Nelson, what's your favorite song you've ever sung?
[01:33:31.042 --> 01:33:33.024]  And he said, this one right here.
[01:33:33.265 --> 01:33:34.926]  And this is my favorite.
[01:33:34.946 --> 01:33:35.327]  Good stuff.
[01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:49.852]  What's funny, Hartman?
[01:33:49.912 --> 01:33:53.776]  It's like Joker villain there.
[01:33:53.816 --> 01:33:58.741]  Jared Neumann is also a comedian as his night job.
[01:33:58.761 --> 01:34:03.106]  So there's like an endless comedian thing going on.
[01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:09.052]  That's Chris Christopherson coming up with Waylon Jennings.
[01:34:09.473 --> 01:34:10.234]  That part's really good.
[01:34:11.331 --> 01:34:15.812]  Crank up Waylon James and then we'll go ahead and let you hear Mr. Cash.
[01:34:15.832 --> 01:34:19.453]  Then I'm going to your phone calls and a bunch of other news.
[01:34:19.813 --> 01:34:20.513]  Stay with us.
[01:34:21.293 --> 01:34:23.474]  I was a dam builder.
[01:34:23.674 --> 01:34:24.934]  I was a dam builder.
[01:34:25.974 --> 01:34:27.054]  Across the 350 deep and wide.
[01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:30.655]  Where steel and water didn't collide.
[01:34:30.715 --> 01:34:35.576]  Place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.
[01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:38.697]  Place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.
[01:34:41.238 --> 01:34:44.419]  I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below.
[01:34:44.779 --> 01:34:47.600]  That's where Jared's going, wet concrete below.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:50.921]  They buried me in that gray tin that knows no sound.
[01:34:51.161 --> 01:34:53.102]  But I am still around.
[01:34:53.342 --> 01:34:57.704]  I'll always be around, and around, and around, and around.
[01:34:57.824 --> 01:35:02.265]  Ah, here's Johnny Cash from the grave, forever.
[01:35:02.305 --> 01:35:05.986]  Bless Johnny Cash, Michael Fox, I bless Johnny Cash.
[01:35:10.875 --> 01:35:27.568]  I'll fly a starship across the universe divide And when I reach the other side I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can Good stuff!
[01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:31.571]  Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
[01:35:33.831 --> 01:35:37.715]  Alright, let's go to your calls, and I'm going to blitz the news at the very end.
[01:35:37.855 --> 01:35:40.357]  Ron in Arizona, you are on the air.
[01:35:40.437 --> 01:35:41.098]  Welcome.
[01:35:42.099 --> 01:35:43.340]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:44.681]  Hey, buddy.
[01:35:45.081 --> 01:35:45.942]  Two quick points.
[01:35:46.623 --> 01:35:57.233]  First, I'd like to say that Pastor Manning is correct that Barry Sotero is a type of the Antichrist, but he cannot be the Antichrist because he's way too old.
[01:35:57.893 --> 01:35:59.615]  When the Antichrist rises to power,
[01:36:00.441 --> 01:36:01.422]  He'll be in his thirties.
[01:36:01.742 --> 01:36:02.883]  He'll come out of Iraq.
[01:36:02.903 --> 01:36:04.244]  He'll be the ruler of Iraq.
[01:36:05.544 --> 01:36:10.247]  And the Antichrist will not rise to power for at least another twenty years.
[01:36:11.048 --> 01:36:12.869]  That stuff can be debated.
[01:36:12.909 --> 01:36:13.890]  It's a secular show.
[01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:16.752]  Manning's just been all over CNN, Fox, you name it.
[01:36:16.812 --> 01:36:19.654]  And when we talked to him, it turned out they're ministry fans of the show.
[01:36:20.354 --> 01:36:28.079]  And so I just wanted, as a prominent black preacher, who's not worshipping Barack Obama, to get his perspective on Barack Obama.
[01:36:31.314 --> 01:36:32.715]  But you have a good point there, Ron.
[01:36:32.915 --> 01:36:33.415]  Anything else?
[01:36:34.296 --> 01:36:39.178]  Yeah, I recently wrote a book explaining this and the New World Order and all that.
[01:36:40.139 --> 01:36:55.508]  But the second thing is, I think when you talk about Barry Sotero and his birth certificate, where he was born, if you could bring up the fact that it doesn't matter because he is not the President of the United States of America.
[01:36:55.528 --> 01:36:55.568]  In 1861,
[01:36:58.444 --> 01:37:03.869]  When the southern congressmen and senators walked out, the union was dissolved.
[01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:18.864]  No, but sir, sir, I understand all... Listen, I appreciate your call, but filing straw men and saying that it's a corrupt republic and that the District of Columbia... All of that is based in reality, but the system just ignores it.
[01:37:20.405 --> 01:37:21.186]  So, yes.
[01:37:24.557 --> 01:37:29.360]  Yeah, you can say that the federal government was a tyranny since the Civil War, but it's here with us now.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:31.221]  So we gotta try to audit the Fed.
[01:37:31.921 --> 01:37:33.802]  We don't just have a problem with the federal government.
[01:37:34.022 --> 01:37:37.164]  The federal government's got global bankers sitting on top of it.
[01:37:37.464 --> 01:37:39.705]  Then here's the federal government, the state government's and us.
[01:37:40.006 --> 01:37:45.769]  We gotta get the bankers off the top of the pyramid first before we cut the federal government down to size.
[01:37:46.089 --> 01:37:47.470]  Up there pulling the levers and
[01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:54.833]  Flipping the dials and running the system, the technocracy, is offshore banking cartels.
[01:37:55.153 --> 01:37:56.434]  We've had a corporate takeover.
[01:37:57.394 --> 01:38:02.016]  And so, we've got to get the bankers out of here first, then we can debate all this other stuff.
[01:38:02.396 --> 01:38:03.076]  But I hear you, Ron.
[01:38:03.097 --> 01:38:03.637]  Good points there.
[01:38:03.877 --> 01:38:04.937]  Daniel in Oklahoma.
[01:38:04.977 --> 01:38:05.838]  Daniel, you're on the air.
[01:38:05.858 --> 01:38:06.198]  Go ahead.
[01:38:07.008 --> 01:38:07.829]  Good afternoon, sir.
[01:38:07.849 --> 01:38:33.127]  I have a kind of a request because I've been hearing a lot, doing a lot of research on the legitimacy of his presidency, Obama's, and I've actually heard on more than one case that they removed a video from YouTube and all the internet of Barack Obama actually admitting that he wasn't eligible to be the President of the United States, and this was when Alan Keyes
[01:38:33.717 --> 01:38:44.182]  When he was doing his campaign for running for the Senate, he actually... Alan Keyes confronted him backstage and said, hey, what are you doing this for?
[01:38:44.262 --> 01:38:45.022]  You're not eligible.
[01:38:45.062 --> 01:38:46.303]  And he said, well, what does it matter?
[01:38:46.523 --> 01:38:48.263]  I'm not running for the President of the United States.
[01:38:50.064 --> 01:38:55.547]  Well, you know, there's one big problem with that rumor, and I've heard it, and I appreciate your call, Daniel.
[01:38:55.767 --> 01:38:56.867]  But it's okay to bring the point up.
[01:38:56.947 --> 01:38:58.168]  I mean, it's a good question to ask.
[01:38:59.128 --> 01:39:01.729]  Alan Keyes would be running around talking about this.
[01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:03.250]  Alan Keyes hates Barack Obama.
[01:39:04.514 --> 01:39:05.715]  Ambassador Alan Keyes.
[01:39:09.878 --> 01:39:13.080]  So, there's your issue right there.
[01:39:14.942 --> 01:39:28.432]  I mean, I always hear about, I get calls every week, on and off air about, my cousin knows a guy who works at a repair shop who saw a checkpoint where a truck jumped over full of martial law signs.
[01:39:28.492 --> 01:39:29.412]  I've been hearing that for 14 years.
[01:39:30.606 --> 01:39:44.416]  But I've got mainstream news, martial law preparations, foreign troops training for gun confiscations and take on the American people, FEMA press releases, NLE09 we're going to be covering all week, and I can't get people to pay attention to it!
[01:39:46.955 --> 01:39:49.617]  The so-called swine flu is clearly manufactured.
[01:39:50.098 --> 01:39:53.160]  Baxter and others put in patents for it a year before it popped up.
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:56.003]  They're building mass graves, getting ready for martial law.
[01:39:56.403 --> 01:39:59.225]  I gave you secret documents before it was mainstream news.
[01:39:59.646 --> 01:40:02.748]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:40:02.768 --> 01:40:04.490]  I mean, it's still not that big of an issue.
[01:40:07.112 --> 01:40:07.973]  All I'm saying is,
[01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:11.992]  Obama could clear all this up by releasing his birth certificate.
[01:40:12.012 --> 01:40:13.634]  And don't give me, he has.
[01:40:14.014 --> 01:40:15.735]  No, he hasn't.
[01:40:16.976 --> 01:40:20.739]  He hasn't released, he's released a certificate.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:24.462]  And now they've waited so long they could fake one.
[01:40:24.562 --> 01:40:29.886]  I mean, they really have, why did, it's getting very, why did he post his birth certificate before anybody was asking the question?
[01:40:30.166 --> 01:40:32.168]  Or his certificate of birth certificate.
[01:40:32.188 --> 01:40:33.349]  Certificate of live birth.
[01:40:34.361 --> 01:40:34.861]  Oh, God.
[01:40:34.961 --> 01:40:35.961]  Robert in Texas.
[01:40:36.061 --> 01:40:36.941]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:40:37.001 --> 01:40:37.382]  Go ahead.
[01:40:37.402 --> 01:40:38.782]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:40:39.082 --> 01:40:39.442]  Good, sir.
[01:40:40.902 --> 01:40:42.482]  I was broadcasting.
[01:40:42.602 --> 01:40:51.904]  I was on the air last night talking about NLE 09, warning people about the, you know, the foreign troops coming over here.
[01:40:53.444 --> 01:41:00.406]  And I had a listener come in the chat room, posted a link to the FEMA website, and said, where does it say anything about foreign troops?
[01:41:00.566 --> 01:41:02.846]  And I said, it's right there in paragraph three.
[01:41:04.082 --> 01:41:05.984]  So I went back to the FEMA site and it was gone.
[01:41:08.165 --> 01:41:12.629]  At the bottom of the site it says last edited on July 24th.
[01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:14.651]  Well let's check into this.
[01:41:14.751 --> 01:41:20.155]  The top link when you put in National Level Exercise 2009 is a FEMA link.
[01:41:20.976 --> 01:41:24.258]  And I printed this again last night.
[01:41:25.659 --> 01:41:28.101]  And the guys printed some more on this today.
[01:41:28.662 --> 01:41:29.983]  National Level Exercise 2009.
[01:41:30.023 --> 01:41:30.383]  And it says
[01:41:33.626 --> 01:41:46.292]  That they're working with federal agencies, state, tribal, and the United States welcomes the participation of Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and NLEO-9.
[01:41:47.313 --> 01:41:56.897]  Then you get into the exercise, which is for counterintelligence, spying on us, foreign governments helping, and practicing, quote, taking on terrorists in the United States.
[01:41:57.578 --> 01:41:59.839]  And then here is the press release from FEMA,
[01:42:01.004 --> 01:42:05.627]  FEMA, Israeli Defense Forces, Home Front Command Partner for Martial Law.
[01:42:05.948 --> 01:42:18.536]  And when you go read this, and it's also in newspapers, they say the Israelis, because they know how to lock down a city, set up checkpoints, they're training all the major police departments on how to set up checkpoints and basically turn us into Gaza.
[01:42:19.377 --> 01:42:24.801]  And whether you love Israel or hate Israel, I sure don't want America to be like Israel, a total police state.
[01:42:25.922 --> 01:42:29.004]  But there's the FEMA official document.
[01:42:29.584 --> 01:42:30.485]  Guys, pull up FEMA.
[01:42:31.991 --> 01:42:35.494]  Just put into Google on screen right now for everybody.
[01:42:35.614 --> 01:42:36.714]  National Level Exercise 2009.
[01:42:36.975 --> 01:42:38.296]  Oh, there it is!
[01:42:39.416 --> 01:42:42.699]  It still says... There it is on screen right here.
[01:42:42.979 --> 01:42:45.881]  Post that on screen for folks watching on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:42:46.101 --> 01:42:56.529]  For folks on the radio, just Google National Level Exercise NLE09, the first Lynx FEMA press release that was put out a few months ago.
[01:42:58.090 --> 01:43:00.671]  And third paragraph says foreign troops right there.
[01:43:01.652 --> 01:43:04.593]  So, sir, I don't know what FEMA sheet you're looking at.
[01:43:05.033 --> 01:43:06.694]  Well, no, I'm looking at the same one you are.
[01:43:06.734 --> 01:43:09.495]  The last sentence was missing last night.
[01:43:09.535 --> 01:43:10.315]  It's back now.
[01:43:10.375 --> 01:43:11.495]  I'm looking at it right now.
[01:43:11.555 --> 01:43:11.976]  It's there.
[01:43:12.536 --> 01:43:17.298]  But if you also look at the bottom of the site, you see where they've been editing the site also.
[01:43:19.210 --> 01:43:23.072]  Last modified, yeah, Friday, July 24th.
[01:43:23.112 --> 01:43:24.192]  So you're right.
[01:43:24.372 --> 01:43:26.273]  Yeah, they've been in there changing things.
[01:43:26.553 --> 01:43:27.854]  They've been changing things.
[01:43:27.894 --> 01:43:29.955]  So that last sentence was not there last night.
[01:43:30.075 --> 01:43:42.060]  It is back today, which makes me believe that you're getting the word out and mainstream might be picking up on the foreign troops, so they had to put it back.
[01:43:42.711 --> 01:44:07.083]  Well, I mean, I remember two months ago, they had drills in Tucson and Phoenix with Israeli, German, French, Dutch, Australian, British, and a bunch of other, and it said, in-fighting terrorists, and I, the local news said, practicing to fight American militias, and I've got army reports all over the country, in fact, I showed one in the first hour today, I'll dig it out in a minute,
[01:44:07.603 --> 01:44:10.204]  This is all going on and the public's in denial.
[01:44:10.464 --> 01:44:12.425]  Folks, we're not making this up.
[01:44:12.785 --> 01:44:13.826]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:44:14.086 --> 01:44:20.929]  In fact, guys, pull up the Curt Nemo story, FEMA, Israeli Defense Forces, Home Front Command Partner.
[01:44:21.429 --> 01:44:25.611]  FEMA, Israeli Defense Forces, Home Front Command Partner for Martial Law.
[01:44:25.911 --> 01:44:35.176]  Because I want to put this on screen, not just Curt Nemo's article, the whole article is hyperlinks to the Department of Homeland Security and to a FEMA press release.
[01:44:36.263 --> 01:44:36.843]  See right here?
[01:44:37.244 --> 01:44:37.684]  Zoom in.
[01:44:38.144 --> 01:44:41.006]  See, people say, oh, that's just InfoWars or Prison Planet.
[01:44:41.486 --> 01:44:44.628]  We are a hundred times better than the mainstream media.
[01:44:44.928 --> 01:44:46.729]  We link to everything we show.
[01:44:47.029 --> 01:44:48.550]  People ask, well, where do you get your info?
[01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:49.871]  FEMA.gov?
[01:44:50.771 --> 01:44:51.812]  Homeland Security?
[01:44:51.832 --> 01:44:53.152]  I mean, look, right there!
[01:44:53.993 --> 01:44:54.933]  Israeli troops!
[01:44:56.394 --> 01:44:57.575]  That's the press release link.
[01:44:58.942 --> 01:45:06.602]  In fact, go ahead and put the actual website up on screen and on video for everybody watching and listening, click on press release.
[01:45:08.442 --> 01:45:09.142]  See the first link?
[01:45:09.542 --> 01:45:17.144]  And there is the press release, FEMA Administrator Fugate meets top Israeli officials to discuss emergency management issues.
[01:45:17.384 --> 01:45:20.704]  Then you read the article, it says they're involved in these drills.
[01:45:21.084 --> 01:45:24.745]  Then we googled that and found it was in Arizona.
[01:45:25.165 --> 01:45:33.347]  I go on air, read mainstream articles, but Arizona's saying how great it is to have foreign troops there, and how great it is to have them training to take on terrorists.
[01:45:33.787 --> 01:45:34.087]  And then,
[01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:36.611]  Look, I've got hundreds of these.
[01:45:36.751 --> 01:45:37.751]  I can't keep track of it.
[01:45:38.051 --> 01:45:39.452]  Here's News Tribune.
[01:45:39.692 --> 01:45:41.193]  Guard units trained for attacks.
[01:45:41.734 --> 01:45:42.814]  Camp Crowder, Missouri.
[01:45:43.515 --> 01:45:51.119]  And it says they practice repulsing an attack on the base by militias and on army checkpoint searching citizens.
[01:45:51.699 --> 01:45:57.342]  And they have army out on highways at mock checkpoints, which always go live.
[01:45:57.402 --> 01:45:58.143]  I videotaped this.
[01:45:58.203 --> 01:45:58.943]  I've been there before.
[01:45:59.363 --> 01:46:01.565]  And others have sent us the video.
[01:46:02.085 --> 01:46:03.506]  And it's got the militias
[01:46:04.667 --> 01:46:07.268]  They're practicing attacking the troops.
[01:46:07.288 --> 01:46:08.328]  It says malicious.
[01:46:12.529 --> 01:46:16.190]  I mean, you can go read this for yourself.
[01:46:16.251 --> 01:46:17.131]  They are practicing.
[01:46:17.191 --> 01:46:22.332]  I mean, Google Pentagon prepares to deploy in the U.S.
[01:46:23.013 --> 01:46:24.693]  or Brigade Homeland Tour.
[01:46:25.033 --> 01:46:30.455]  Google that and you'll be on Army Times saying they're preparing to put regular Army
[01:46:31.448 --> 01:46:35.009]  Two months ago, Tennessee, I had the state rep on.
[01:46:35.049 --> 01:46:39.770]  The army was out randomly running checkpoints in a four-state area.
[01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:41.190]  Tennessee was the only state to say no.
[01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:43.330]  And they told the governor, we're going to do it anyways.
[01:46:43.751 --> 01:46:45.011]  This was in the news!
[01:46:45.071 --> 01:46:45.891]  This is happening!
[01:46:47.311 --> 01:46:51.092]  And they just acclimate and acclimate and acclimate and acclimate and acclimate.
[01:46:51.132 --> 01:46:52.992]  And then we say something and they make fun of us.
[01:46:54.953 --> 01:46:55.633]  You know, I watched
[01:46:56.789 --> 01:46:58.349]  Real time with Bill Maher this weekend.
[01:46:58.369 --> 01:46:59.470]  I haven't watched it in months.
[01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:01.350]  And it was all lies.
[01:47:02.730 --> 01:47:05.371]  Just, just, and making fun of anybody that talks about this.
[01:47:05.411 --> 01:47:07.231]  And if you don't like Obama, you're a racist.
[01:47:07.612 --> 01:47:10.292]  I get these hundreds of emails a week saying, you're a racist, you're a racist.
[01:47:10.652 --> 01:47:14.413]  Folks, I'm not the one setting up abortuaries in black neighborhoods.
[01:47:14.493 --> 01:47:19.294]  I'm not the one grabbing black foster kids to test chemical and biologicals on them and radiologicals.
[01:47:19.634 --> 01:47:22.055]  And if your black leaders weren't paid off, they'd be fighting it.
[01:47:23.766 --> 01:47:25.607]  But it's not blacks telling me I'm racist.
[01:47:25.688 --> 01:47:27.549]  It's stupid yuppies.
[01:47:28.210 --> 01:47:29.050]  It's white people.
[01:47:31.652 --> 01:47:32.493]  It's a religion.
[01:47:32.973 --> 01:47:38.438]  You know, by saying you're a racist if you fight Obama, they then push his whole agenda through.
[01:47:38.898 --> 01:47:40.099]  You don't want a carbon tax?
[01:47:40.339 --> 01:47:40.920]  You're a racist.
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:42.221]  You don't want open borders?
[01:47:42.421 --> 01:47:42.961]  You're a racist.
[01:47:43.242 --> 01:47:44.282]  You don't want to lose your job?
[01:47:44.302 --> 01:47:44.743]  You're a racist.
[01:47:44.943 --> 01:47:48.266]  You don't want the government controlling and fining you thousands of dollars a year?
[01:47:49.972 --> 01:47:53.074]  If you don't have government health care, you're a racist.
[01:47:53.214 --> 01:47:53.475]  No!
[01:47:54.916 --> 01:47:55.196]  No!
[01:47:57.197 --> 01:47:58.198]  This is tribalism.
[01:47:58.238 --> 01:48:00.780]  They are playing us all off against each other.
[01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:03.882]  You know, tomorrow I'll get more into the whole flu thing.
[01:48:03.902 --> 01:48:05.984]  I prepared a huge folder on all this.
[01:48:06.584 --> 01:48:06.864]  Here is
[01:48:09.724 --> 01:48:15.767]  Public Safety Canada Media Relations with the phone number with Canada saying they're taking part in the drill.
[01:48:16.328 --> 01:48:31.996]  And I've got news articles from 2002 where they signed deals with Canadian and Mexican military to quote use Mexican and Canadian troops in the US for martial law to quote take on American terrorists and for insurrection.
[01:48:32.356 --> 01:48:33.437]  This is a fact!
[01:48:34.926 --> 01:48:44.690]  So see, they deny it, deny it, deny it, but if you go to the training, and you go read the FEMA press releases that I just put on screen, they say it's to take on American terrorists!
[01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:46.231]  Foreign troops!
[01:48:46.751 --> 01:49:00.717]  I've had Colonel Craig Roberts on, whose nephew went through West Point, and they had Wesley Clark and people in there giving him speeches saying, get ready to work with foreign troops to suppress American insurrection!
[01:49:01.604 --> 01:49:03.205]  They are going to use foreign troops.
[01:49:03.525 --> 01:49:06.047]  As crazy as that is, it's real, folks!
[01:49:06.427 --> 01:49:07.949]  This is really going on.
[01:49:08.669 --> 01:49:11.171]  I can show you the video out of the different
[01:49:12.318 --> 01:49:20.067]  to television stations in Florida when they landed troops from more than 12 nations from Latin America to quote, take on American terrorists.
[01:49:20.728 --> 01:49:24.011]  In fact, Google Latin American troops land in Florida.
[01:49:24.212 --> 01:49:28.737]  We can show them the video right now during the break for people watching on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:49:29.358 --> 01:49:30.499]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:49:30.539 --> 01:49:32.101]  It's wallowing in evidence.
[01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:37.475]  I have the army following and watching me.
[01:49:37.595 --> 01:49:39.858]  It's in mainstream news they're doing it.
[01:49:40.619 --> 01:49:45.245]  Months after I tell you because the army leaks me a secret document because they don't like it.
[01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:50.580]  Folks, we're far down the rat hole when the army is following me around.
[01:49:50.981 --> 01:49:52.841]  They might be following me home today!
[01:49:53.521 --> 01:50:00.744]  I'll be like, oh, there they are behind me and I can take ten turns and they're following me and they'll smile at me and laugh at me, it's all real funny.
[01:50:01.164 --> 01:50:01.984]  It's not funny!
[01:50:02.705 --> 01:50:05.186]  You guys are traitors!
[01:50:05.626 --> 01:50:11.628]  They've been over in Baghdad shooting people and torturing people and doing their crap and now they're here and
[01:50:12.691 --> 01:50:15.892]  In fact, Hoos gave me an article earlier that I'm going to have some guests on.
[01:50:16.252 --> 01:50:19.112]  Lethal warriors bring combat hostility home.
[01:50:19.632 --> 01:50:21.833]  One unit where ten of them committed murders.
[01:50:22.853 --> 01:50:25.714]  Units where three or four separately go out and rob banks.
[01:50:26.254 --> 01:50:27.314]  They're just going crazy.
[01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:32.355]  But see, most of them aren't going to have to rob banks because they're used to killing and stealing and breaking down doors.
[01:50:32.735 --> 01:50:35.356]  This screws people up, folks, especially when you do two or three tours.
[01:50:36.016 --> 01:50:37.676]  It screws up about half the people who do one tour.
[01:50:37.976 --> 01:50:38.957]  Now they're all warped.
[01:50:39.197 --> 01:50:40.357]  They're all going to be cops.
[01:50:40.737 --> 01:50:42.939]  They got these kind of guys following me around.
[01:50:43.279 --> 01:50:44.720]  Following Ron Paul around.
[01:50:45.341 --> 01:50:46.982]  Baltimore Sun reported on that.
[01:50:48.923 --> 01:50:50.845]  I mean, this is crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:51.005 --> 01:50:53.927]  Now, a lot of the troops are good patriotic people, and they know what's going on.
[01:50:54.968 --> 01:50:58.471]  But, uh, I mean, it is a total martial law grid.
[01:50:59.231 --> 01:51:04.595]  And it is expanding its net right now, and the enemy's building up, it looks like, to move against us.
[01:51:04.976 --> 01:51:06.116]  So, just get ready.
[01:51:06.156 --> 01:51:06.657]  Hold on.
[01:51:07.617 --> 01:51:12.919]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:18.982]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:51:19.522 --> 01:51:25.685]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:51:26.025 --> 01:51:27.846]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:51:27.966 --> 01:51:30.367]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:51:30.447 --> 01:51:41.392]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:51:43.633 --> 01:51:44.914]  It's not about left or right.
[01:51:45.314 --> 01:51:46.695]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:51:47.175 --> 01:51:53.398]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:51:54.053 --> 01:52:01.826]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:02.347 --> 01:52:03.469]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:03.909 --> 01:52:05.091]  The people strike back!
[01:52:09.073 --> 01:52:13.115]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.

[01:53:08.985 --> 01:53:14.170]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:53:14.351 --> 01:53:15.692]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:53:15.952 --> 01:53:24.141]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:53:34.268 --> 01:53:38.629]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:53:38.809 --> 01:53:40.910]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:48.552]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:54:37.255 --> 01:54:39.757]  I want to jam in a few final calls here.
[01:54:40.858 --> 01:54:41.679]  Who's up next?
[01:54:42.299 --> 01:54:43.921]  Here, John, I got my call list mixed up.
[01:54:45.549 --> 01:54:46.290]  Mike, Virginia.
[01:54:46.611 --> 01:54:48.894]  We'll probably get to Mike in Virginia and Mike in California.
[01:54:49.394 --> 01:54:51.737]  Dwayne and Jim and others we may not get to, but we'll see.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:57.065]  I did want to just, in closing, thank our sponsors.

[01:55:03.413 --> 01:55:07.054]  The control freak, globalist, coming in with their carbon taxes.
[01:55:07.114 --> 01:55:09.215]  It's just good to start getting off the grid.
[01:55:09.715 --> 01:55:11.996]  A great little unit that will power quite a bit in your house.

[01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:40.891]  They've got a new unit out.
[01:55:41.291 --> 01:55:42.072]  They're special.
[01:55:42.352 --> 01:55:44.174]  20% off ends today.
[01:55:44.554 --> 01:55:45.555]  So I've called today.

[01:55:58.407 --> 01:55:58.447]  800-691-6043.
[01:56:02.392 --> 01:56:02.772]  Hello Alex.
[01:56:02.792 --> 01:56:03.073]  Hi Mike.
[01:56:25.979 --> 01:56:34.381]  Um, I'm calling because, uh, I found some images on the dollar bill that, uh, Jordan Maxwell or anybody hasn't found today, uh, that I know of.
[01:56:35.041 --> 01:56:37.582]  Um, I'll try to make this quick because I know you're trying to take other calls.
[01:56:37.982 --> 01:56:42.243]  Alright, what you need to do is get about, uh, five to ten dollar, one dollar bills.
[01:56:42.723 --> 01:56:48.324]  The area you're looking for is the white and black dots behind George Washington's head.
[01:56:48.764 --> 01:56:52.585]  You usually turn the dollar bill on its side or upside down, still looking at the front
[01:56:53.044 --> 01:56:53.424]  Of course.
[01:56:54.165 --> 01:56:58.406]  I found skulls, occult images, just all kinds of stuff.
[01:56:58.446 --> 01:57:00.307]  No, I don't think anybody's seen that.
[01:57:01.408 --> 01:57:03.429]  Well, there's all sorts of secret stuff.
[01:57:04.449 --> 01:57:31.753]  on the dollar bill i don't have a dollar bill as a twenty and a ten and a five but uh... it's just filled with a cultic stuff and they admit it is so why don't you scan in that little image and just that little part of it and then pointed out right a blurb and send it to writers and info wars dot com we get a lot of listeners submitted ideas and stuff and a lot of it's great we're posting most of it post anything you want in the prison planet forum unless it's calling for violence
[01:57:32.694 --> 01:57:35.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[01:57:35.641 --> 01:57:36.503]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:57:37.565 --> 01:57:38.708]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:57:39.970 --> 01:57:42.031]  First, I want to thank you for everything that you're doing.
[01:57:42.051 --> 01:57:50.877]  You actually made me feel sane again, because for a long time, I had a lot of people saying, hey, you're crazy for all these things you're thinking.
[01:57:51.177 --> 01:57:52.018]  I'm 31 years old.
[01:57:52.058 --> 01:57:53.939]  I started doing this when I was 18 years old.
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.963]  I got into studying Babylon and unlocking Babylon.
[01:58:00.583 --> 01:58:05.266]  It got me into the whole monarchy, and I started seeing what the system was really about.
[01:58:08.098 --> 01:58:19.212]  I actually read a book by Alexander Hilflock called The True Babylon, and it, you know, it woke me up to the whole thing and actually seeing, you know, the whole system that our government is.
[01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:20.554]  It's almost a mere image of it.
[01:58:23.018 --> 01:58:29.722]  Well, these are Babylonian Mystery School systems of psychology and government and controlling populations.
[01:58:29.742 --> 01:58:34.184]  And if you know that science, then you have a monopoly over everything else in rule.
[01:58:34.884 --> 01:58:39.307]  But somehow they convinced the population not to even look into the sciences of control.
[01:58:39.567 --> 01:58:42.068]  It's our job to just get people to wake up and look around them.
[01:58:42.328 --> 01:58:42.889]  Thank you.
