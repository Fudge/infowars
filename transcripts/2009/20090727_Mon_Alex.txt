[00:00:04.855 --> 00:00:09.697]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:11.277]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:12.197]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.197 --> 00:00:17.019]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.060]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:37.390]  I tell you folks, the establishment is scared to death of the birthers.
[00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.732]  They like to make fun of 9-11 truthers as the truthers.
[00:00:40.732 --> 00:00:42.273]  The twoofers.
[00:00:42.273 --> 00:00:47.316]  But now they're really scared of the birthers.
[00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:52.498]  And I've covered this issue some, you know, back during the campaign and after.
[00:00:52.498 --> 00:00:54.599]  I've seen it as somewhat of a red herring.
[00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:57.881]  Not that there may not be substance in red meat somewhere there.
[00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:00.783]  There's just so much smoke, I can't find where the fire is.
[00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:06.667]  But they are acting scared, they do have fear in their eyes.
[00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.989]  The body language is, it's true.
[00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:17.695]  The behavior of the president and his minions and his acolytes and his surrogates is that it's true.
[00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:23.499]  The behavior of his grandmother saying it's true and Kenyan newspapers saying it's true and they're proud of it.
[00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:28.302]  They've erected a shrine at his birthplace.
[00:01:28.302 --> 00:01:31.765]  Now this is overall a distraction from his agenda.
[00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:48.941]  You know, they kind of enjoyed making fun of people during the campaign to get off of his actual policies, like carbon taxes and socialized health care and open borders and anti-Second Amendment legislation, the list goes on and on.
[00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:54.105]  That's why the Obama deception doesn't get into his birth certificate.
[00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:58.048]  Now, the new film does a little bit.
[00:01:58.048 --> 00:02:01.471]  And I called to get Phil Berg on today, really nice guy, lawyer, former
[00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.243]  Deputy Attorney General in one state.
[00:02:05.243 --> 00:02:07.765]  And he said, why wasn't I in the Obama deception?
[00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:09.906]  And I said, well, why don't you be in the new one then?
[00:02:09.906 --> 00:02:12.508]  We'll just fly a team out to interview you.
[00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:14.730]  Because it is important to look at.
[00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.211]  So Berg's either on today or tomorrow.
[00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:17.372]  We want to get him to a landline.
[00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:18.493]  He's a busy lawyer.
[00:02:18.493 --> 00:02:19.574]  He is on today.
[00:02:19.574 --> 00:02:20.054]  It's set.
[00:02:20.054 --> 00:02:21.035]  Landline.
[00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:22.076]  One o'clock.
[00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:23.537]  T-minus two hours.
[00:02:23.537 --> 00:02:25.678]  You want to be technical.
[00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:30.002]  One hour, 57 minutes, 30 seconds exactly on mark.
[00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:43.089]  And then we've got Reverend James Manning who has made a lot of headlines with his rebukes of Obama.
[00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:50.774]  So I thought we would have him on to weigh in coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:54.096]  That should be always interesting and informing.
[00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:54.757]  Informative!
[00:02:56.786 --> 00:03:00.072]  I have a giant important news blitz obviously here in front of me.
[00:03:00.072 --> 00:03:07.928]  NLE09, National Level Exercise 09, is now in full swing.
[00:03:07.928 --> 00:03:08.809]  It starts today!
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.522]  And we'll go over FEMA's original press release and the latest.
[00:03:18.522 --> 00:03:22.204]  Government of Canada participates in major security exercise.
[00:03:22.204 --> 00:03:29.328]  This put out by Marketplace, Marketwire, a statement by the Information Office of Canada.
[00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:33.811]  We'll tell you about the Canadians, the Germans, the Israelis, the French, the Dutch.
[00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:42.577]  Fourteen different nations participating in a drill to take over the United States and combat American terrorists.
[00:03:44.608 --> 00:03:54.412]  You can see my film, Police Day 2000, where you can witness foreign troops in a tabletop exercise training to take over the United States, and role players playing the part of U.S.
[00:03:54.412 --> 00:03:57.194]  citizens having their firearms confiscated.
[00:03:57.194 --> 00:04:00.555]  This has been going on for a long time, but now they admit it's foreign troops.
[00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:03.476]  Now they admit it's a drill here in the United States.
[00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:06.037]  That's the difference.
[00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:09.879]  I'd go to an urban warfare drill in Texas or California or other states.
[00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.361]  We got footage out of Maryland, footage out of North Carolina, Alabama.
[00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:16.107]  Went to Florida.
[00:04:16.107 --> 00:04:22.712]  And the troops would openly be training to confiscate our guns and take over city halls and admitting it was for the U.S.
[00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:29.356]  They'd go door-to-door telling neighborhood people, before I even got there, they'd been listening to my phones, Alex Jones is coming.
[00:04:29.356 --> 00:04:31.518]  We have interviews with these people.
[00:04:31.518 --> 00:04:36.381]  The Army, knocking door-to-door, when he comes, don't talk to him.
[00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:41.025]  Boy, I tell ya, that's a real good use of resources there, isn't it?
[00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:42.706]  The U.S.
[00:04:42.706 --> 00:04:42.926]  Army.
[00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:46.126]  And their number one enemy, I guess, Alex Jones.
[00:04:46.126 --> 00:04:53.828]  Of course, the troops love me, but the establishment that hijacked our military know that if I ever wake the troops up, it's over for them.
[00:04:53.828 --> 00:05:00.471]  But then I'd watch CNN and they'd say it was for Iraq or Afghanistan or other countries.
[00:05:00.471 --> 00:05:05.672]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:09.714]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.714 --> 00:05:10.674]  Number two, our new
[00:05:10.674 --> 00:05:11.996]  We're good to go!
[00:05:30.777 --> 00:05:34.138]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:01.471 --> 00:06:07.493]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.493 --> 00:06:13.376]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.376 --> 00:06:19.538]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.878 --> 00:06:21.840]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.301]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:37.511]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:37.511 --> 00:06:39.172]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.172 --> 00:06:41.034]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:45.417]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told.
[00:06:46.022 --> 00:06:47.924]  And his real agenda.
[00:06:47.924 --> 00:06:56.191]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:56.191 --> 00:06:57.773]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.773 --> 00:06:58.974]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:08.163]  As you already know, drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:07:08.163 --> 00:07:12.825]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:07:12.825 --> 00:07:17.687]  Alkavision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:07:18.047 --> 00:07:25.772]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:07:25.772 --> 00:07:30.335]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[00:07:30.335 --> 00:07:36.239]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:42.521]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:53.305]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.645 --> 00:08:08.407]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.407 --> 00:08:10.169]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:11.751]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:13.313]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.313 --> 00:08:17.497]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:21.562]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.643 --> 00:08:33.127]  We've got Attorney Phil Berg joining us in an hour and 12 minutes from now.
[00:08:33.127 --> 00:08:36.029]  An hour and 52 minutes from now.
[00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:40.230]  Public school education level mathematics here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.292]  He'll be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:08:44.292 --> 00:08:50.415]  And Reverend James Manning to break down his view of Barack Obama and his last
[00:08:51.605 --> 00:08:56.929]  Sermon titled, The White Folks Are Gonna Riot.
[00:08:56.929 --> 00:09:07.436]  So we'll get his perspective on that coming up as well today.
[00:09:07.436 --> 00:09:19.685]  We have the national level exercise 2009 that started this morning with FEMA and at least 14 other governments teaming up in a drill to suppress the American people.
[00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:32.837]  With an emphasis towards the 14 nations teaming up to surveil and warrantlessly spy on US citizens.
[00:09:32.837 --> 00:09:47.890]  When I got back from Operation Urban Warrior, a similar drill in Oakland, California in 1999, I was shown a video by Marines, but was not allowed to put it on television,
[00:09:48.968 --> 00:09:53.051]  of Operation Death Star.
[00:09:53.051 --> 00:10:07.102]  And Operation Death Star was protesters being followed by unmanned aerial vehicles by the Marine Corps.
[00:10:07.102 --> 00:10:15.589]  So you have a drill with the Marine Corps and French, Dutch, Israeli, British, Scottish, Australian, German,
[00:10:16.897 --> 00:10:28.663]  And other troops training to take over the city, role players screaming, I'm an American, no not the camp, mock police arresting citizens, doing mock executions of the Marines, all on video.
[00:10:28.663 --> 00:10:33.585]  Interrogating the citizens, where'd you get the gun, where'd you get the helmet, where are you from, San Francisco.
[00:10:34.923 --> 00:10:40.988]  Then you'd see the Marine Corps spokesman, the civilian, Mr. Jones, would run in.
[00:10:40.988 --> 00:10:44.511]  Steve Jones was his name, telling me, turn the camera off, you can't film this part.
[00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:45.932]  He kept getting madder and madder.
[00:10:45.932 --> 00:10:50.777]  But we were given authorization by his higher-ups to go in and cover the event.
[00:10:50.777 --> 00:10:53.099]  Then we got thrown out.
[00:10:53.099 --> 00:11:01.566]  But they were also giving citizen tours of the drills, and then so we sent our people in as, quote, just regular tourists, and I got the most damning footage.
[00:11:03.083 --> 00:11:17.810]  But because they had a university area shutdown that we're doing in that part of Oakland, but they also practice occupying some of the bridges and some of the railheads and ports.
[00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:30.897]  And then I'd watch national news in my hotel room at night on CNN, they'd say, Marines are training in Oakland to help in the peacekeeping operation in Macedonia and in Serbia and Kosovo.
[00:11:32.697 --> 00:11:36.379]  And in a way that was true from a lawyer's speak because it did have dual use.
[00:11:39.397 --> 00:11:43.019]  But all of that is going on right now in the United States.
[00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:47.502]  It's going on in Arizona, and it's going on in Michigan, and it's going on in Florida.
[00:11:47.502 --> 00:11:50.244]  And they've, in the last two months, had buildups to this.
[00:11:50.244 --> 00:11:58.590]  And the Miami Heralds had the photos of troops from 12 nations of Latin America land, flying their flags for the first time in U.S.
[00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.010]  history.
[00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:09.057]  And Mexican troops, aid and drills in South Texas, bearing their flag and loaded weapons for the first time since the Mexican-American War.
[00:12:11.838 --> 00:12:21.541]  And Dutch troops land in Michigan and Japanese troops assist Czech Republic troops in San Diego.
[00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:24.322]  It's all over the news today.
[00:12:24.322 --> 00:12:28.384]  Oh, look, they're landing with UN flags in America.
[00:12:28.384 --> 00:12:33.186]  Oh, look, the foreign AWACS are in the sky.
[00:12:33.186 --> 00:12:36.327]  Then I was shown video of Operation Death Starb.
[00:12:39.497 --> 00:12:47.919]  And I have a shown video of us coming out of our hotel in the morning and getting in our Ford Taurus and driving over to the drills.
[00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:53.940]  So see, during the live drill, thousands of Marines and other troops from other countries, with the U.S.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:13:04.102]  Marine Corps leading it, they had not just the trainees in the big drill, but the higher level units that had already been trained previously, watching us and other people
[00:13:05.555 --> 00:13:09.877]  And I was only allowed to see about 10 minutes of this and begged for it, was told no.
[00:13:09.877 --> 00:13:28.565]  And it was, then they had, during the drill, other Marines in plain clothes practicing landing dinghy boats and loading WMDs in the back of a moving truck in Oakland and another one in San Francisco in Operation Death Star.
[00:13:28.565 --> 00:13:30.206]  This is only one part of it.
[00:13:30.206 --> 00:13:33.067]  Operation Death Star with the drones watching them.
[00:13:34.116 --> 00:13:36.957]  Again, casting the militias, the U.S.
[00:13:36.957 --> 00:13:42.420]  gun owners, as the terrorists.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:54.466]  So during Operation Urban Warrior in 1999, the Marines were running classified ops like Operation Death Star.
[00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:58.888]  Operation Death Star.
[00:13:58.888 --> 00:14:01.309]  And Death Star was looking down on us.
[00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.399]  That was 1999, 10 years ago.
[00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:03.779]  10 years ago.
[00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:05.380]  Fast forward to November 22nd.
[00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:25.095]  In the Fed demonstrations in 38 locations, Ron Paul in Houston is giving a speech.
[00:14:25.095 --> 00:14:34.382]  I'm giving a speech in Dallas at the Fed with Ron Paul's brother, Wayne Paul, and I get sent a secret document from the Army, people inside the Army that were upset.
[00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:40.011]  Listing us as terrorists and saying we were being watched at all 38 locations.
[00:14:40.011 --> 00:14:42.193]  This is out of the Texas office.
[00:14:42.193 --> 00:14:51.798]  Specifically that we were being watched and did not let us know that they were army because we were terrorists and might kill them!
[00:14:51.798 --> 00:14:54.480]  Again, casting me and Ron Paul and his brother
[00:14:55.817 --> 00:15:05.903]  As like the murdering gremlins or as deadly as the Monty Python holy grail rabbit that chews everyone's throats out.
[00:15:05.903 --> 00:15:09.765]  I mean, I was just like I am this little fuzzy sweet thing.
[00:15:09.765 --> 00:15:14.888]  But if you let me know you're the army watching me, I may rip your throat out.
[00:15:14.888 --> 00:15:17.830]  Ron Paul may rip your throat out.
[00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:18.971]  You know, I'm there with my camera.
[00:15:19.892 --> 00:15:29.217]  With a 35mm around my neck and a video camera in my hand at Urban Warrior, and I've got to have hover drones following me around.
[00:15:29.217 --> 00:15:38.682]  Because I'm as deadly as the Guardian of the Grail, the one-pound white rabbit.
[00:15:38.682 --> 00:15:40.403]  It is ridiculous.
[00:15:40.403 --> 00:15:43.765]  If you haven't seen that Monty Python, you don't know what I'm talking about.
[00:15:43.765 --> 00:15:47.547]  The Guardian of the Holy Grail's a little rabbit.
[00:15:48.612 --> 00:15:49.372]  This is ridiculous!
[00:16:09.775 --> 00:16:12.836]  I forget which Missouri paper, but it was written by the Army.
[00:16:12.836 --> 00:16:20.199]  We now have local liaison Army officers in the police departments and in the papers, assigned to local papers, and the papers are understaffed.
[00:16:20.199 --> 00:16:22.239]  They like having an Army captain.
[00:16:22.239 --> 00:16:29.202]  It was written by an Army captain, and he's telling everybody, oh, what was the headline?
[00:16:29.202 --> 00:16:37.425]  Exact headline was, Militia's National Guard drills for militia attack
[00:16:41.244 --> 00:16:46.787]  On Checkpoint or was it National Guard Drills for Militia Attack Missouri?
[00:16:46.787 --> 00:16:48.247]  That'll get it.
[00:16:48.247 --> 00:16:51.969]  See, as I'm here talking, I have thousands of pieces of proof.
[00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:54.010]  Hundreds in the last month!
[00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:58.232]  And they had those drills in Iowa where they were doing door-to-door gun confiscation drills.
[00:16:58.232 --> 00:17:00.133]  The newspaper said that!
[00:17:00.133 --> 00:17:04.295]  It had the Army Sergeant saying, yeah, we're going to do a gun drill, door-to-door,
[00:17:05.595 --> 00:17:21.119]  And then I was the bad one, though, in the local paper when I reported it and read what the paper said, that the Army was going to go door-to-door and was doing a drill of shutting down a gun shop owner who'd sold illegal guns to locals, a door-to-door gun checkpoint.
[00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:34.103]  And then we have real knock-and-talk drills all over the country, where they just come and ask to search your house and look at your guns, and the Illinois governor gets on TV and says, we're going to use the Army for door-to-door gun confiscation.
[00:17:35.984 --> 00:17:40.046]  But then the Barack Obama people say, you know, don't worry about it, it's no big deal.
[00:17:40.046 --> 00:17:48.850]  And then, after I gave you the Secret Army document, for the last in the Fed demonstrations a few months ago, it was in the Baltimore Sun.
[00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.611]  Headline!
[00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:51.712]  Baltimore Sun.
[00:17:51.712 --> 00:17:54.653]  Go ahead and give me that one.
[00:17:54.653 --> 00:17:57.135]  Army watching tea parties.
[00:17:57.135 --> 00:17:57.835]  That was the one.
[00:17:57.835 --> 00:18:00.856]  But when you read the article, it was actually in the Fed demonstrations.
[00:18:00.856 --> 00:18:05.259]  Now, here is the News Tribune out of Missouri, Camp Crowder, Missouri.
[00:18:06.855 --> 00:18:09.177]  And you can go there.
[00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:11.199]  It's written by a member of the Army.
[00:18:11.199 --> 00:18:15.584]  Again, the Army writes for our papers now, just like they do in Iraq.
[00:18:15.584 --> 00:18:17.566]  Guard units trained for attacks.
[00:18:18.732 --> 00:18:23.456]  Then it says, for militias attacking the army base.
[00:18:23.456 --> 00:18:25.657]  Yes, that's exactly what the militias are going to be doing.
[00:18:25.657 --> 00:18:28.019]  And militias attacking checkpoints.
[00:18:28.019 --> 00:18:35.365]  You mean when a family doesn't let you grab their wife and kid and split you up and put the man in one truck and the women and the kids in another?
[00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:37.227]  You mean people are going to go ahead and draw on you?
[00:18:37.227 --> 00:18:39.268]  Yeah, it's going to happen.
[00:18:39.268 --> 00:18:41.170]  And then you're going to say we're terrorists on the news.
[00:18:42.796 --> 00:18:51.419]  So see, you corner us, you push us into a corner, and then if we don't go to the FEMA camp, we're terrorists.
[00:18:51.419 --> 00:19:07.924]  My God, what do you do when you roll up on a checkpoint and they want to see your papers and, you know, they got a .50 swung around on you out of the back of a Humvee and local police helping them and the minute you make a move they just kill everybody in the car like it's Baghdad or Fallujah.
[00:19:07.924 --> 00:19:11.105]  The answer is, you pull up on a checkpoint, you turn around and go the other direction.
[00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.751]  And then they're going to try to stop you there.
[00:19:13.751 --> 00:19:21.277]  They're openly announcing checkpoints, FEMA camps, roadblocks, under the guise of the flu outbreak.
[00:19:21.277 --> 00:19:23.959]  See, perfect cover for them coming up in the fall.
[00:19:23.959 --> 00:19:26.981]  But if we get the word out on this, they're not going to get away with it.
[00:19:26.981 --> 00:19:30.784]  And if we get the word out to the military and police, this isn't going to happen.
[00:19:30.784 --> 00:19:31.645]  We can stop this.
[00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.952]  Oh, he just brought it in here for me.
[00:19:35.952 --> 00:19:37.653]  Oh, here's one out of the BBC.
[00:19:37.653 --> 00:19:40.935]  Ukrainian NATO troops set up checkpoints in Scotland.
[00:19:40.935 --> 00:19:42.155]  See, it's happening everywhere.
[00:19:42.155 --> 00:19:43.616]  BBC.
[00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:46.138]  Ukrainian NATO troops set up checkpoints in Scotland.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:47.299]  BBC.
[00:19:47.299 --> 00:19:53.502]  See, foreign troops are everywhere, worldwide, trying to suppress populations for the bankers right now.
[00:19:53.502 --> 00:19:59.046]  I'll tell you more about NLE09, the flu, fear-mongering, and a lot more coming up.
[00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:02.132]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.132 --> 00:20:07.734]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:20:07.734 --> 00:20:12.756]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:20:12.756 --> 00:20:17.778]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:23.542]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:25.863]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:20:25.863 --> 00:20:30.666]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:20:30.666 --> 00:20:31.787]  And here's the best part.
[00:20:31.787 --> 00:20:34.849]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:20:34.849 --> 00:20:38.472]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:20:38.472 --> 00:20:41.654]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:41.654 --> 00:20:43.875]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:20:52.683 --> 00:20:57.508]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:20:57.508 --> 00:20:59.891]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:04.468]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[00:21:50.751 --> 00:21:51.691]  It is a big idea.
[00:21:51.691 --> 00:21:52.372]  A new world order.
[00:22:06.806 --> 00:22:09.967]  The Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:22:09.967 --> 00:22:12.788]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:22:12.788 --> 00:22:15.569]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:22:15.569 --> 00:22:18.750]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:26.073]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:34.554]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:22:34.554 --> 00:22:38.436]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:22:38.436 --> 00:22:40.998]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:22:40.998 --> 00:22:42.159]  Most people have no idea.
[00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:42.939]  They're not after money.
[00:22:42.939 --> 00:22:44.220]  They have all the money they need.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:44.981]  They're after power.
[00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:46.342]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:22:55.848 --> 00:22:57.869]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:22:57.869 --> 00:22:58.950]  You have been warned.
[00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:06.773]  If you'd like to quit smoking regular cigarettes and try a revolutionary new alternative, this might be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:23:06.773 --> 00:23:10.235]  PremiumeCigarette.com brings you the electronic cigarette.
[00:23:10.235 --> 00:23:15.997]  It looks like a cigarette, it feels and tastes like a cigarette, and even delivers nicotine like a cigarette.
[00:23:15.997 --> 00:23:22.180]  But because this is not a cigarette, it doesn't deliver toxic chemicals and tar into your lungs or discolor your teeth.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.060]  The PremiumeCigarette.com
[00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:26.171]  We're good to go.
[00:23:57.122 --> 00:24:08.186]  Remember two months ago, all over the Tennessee papers, we had a state rep on.
[00:24:08.186 --> 00:24:14.529]  The governor told the Army and Homeland Security to stop running warrantless checkpoints, shutting down whole highways, searching people.
[00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:18.070]  They just ignored them and went ahead and did it anyways.
[00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.832]  And put the photos and videos on the local news stations and the newspapers.
[00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:23.951]  But here's BBC.
[00:24:23.951 --> 00:24:27.973]  Ukrainian Marines stop drivers.
[00:24:27.973 --> 00:24:32.675]  Motorists using a public road were forced to stop by Ukrainian Marines acting with French soldiers.
[00:24:32.675 --> 00:24:36.878]  The events took place during an amphibious landing exercise at Loose Bay on Saturday.
[00:24:36.878 --> 00:24:45.322]  Two armed Ukrainian Marines involved in mock hunt for terrorists had forced a number of vehicles on a coastal road near Port William to pull over.
[00:24:45.322 --> 00:24:47.123]  And see, they always say this.
[00:24:47.123 --> 00:24:50.425]  And this goes on over the years many times.
[00:24:50.425 --> 00:24:52.086]  Take Swansboro, North Carolina.
[00:24:53.413 --> 00:24:56.214]  We have this footage in Police State 2, the takeover.
[00:24:56.214 --> 00:25:04.236]  The Marines take over the town, set up real checkpoints, and then started pulling over real citizens' cars!
[00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:20.640]  See, but they have the police, the police work, they come over and stop you, to have the local municipal authority, and then the Marines come over and go mindedly search, and people are like, well sure, and that's meant to acclimate the Marines, acclimate the citizens, acclimate the cops.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.080]  This is slow death!
[00:25:23.112 --> 00:25:28.215]  Our troops aren't bad, they're being brainwashed.
[00:25:28.215 --> 00:25:32.078]  The citizens aren't bad, they're being acclimated and brainwashed here.
[00:25:32.078 --> 00:25:35.040]  We're being trained to be occupied.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:41.504]  But they won't put troops on the borders and if they do, they're not allowed to have their firearms and they get shot at and killed and they turn tail and run.
[00:25:41.504 --> 00:25:44.006]  That's in the news.
[00:25:44.006 --> 00:25:46.347]  So we've got more on National Level Exercise NLE-09.
[00:25:48.564 --> 00:25:52.907]  Coming up, and the foreign troops that are involved, different facets to it the next week.
[00:25:52.907 --> 00:26:00.912]  We've got a bunch of guests coming up, and we're going to be taking calls from listeners who specifically are seeing NLEO-9 drills.
[00:26:00.912 --> 00:26:17.364]  We got video, one of Jason Bermas' friends, he's already got a lot of friends here in Austin, lived here four or five months, and one of his friends shot some video in San Marcos of Homeland Security and Northcom trucks driving around.
[00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:21.847]  In fact, I had that sent to Paul Watson and Curt Nemo, but they wrote big articles this morning.
[00:26:21.847 --> 00:26:24.110]  They haven't gotten around to it yet.
[00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:30.257]  Maybe I'll have Aaron or somebody just post the video.
[00:26:30.257 --> 00:26:33.140]  But that's going on.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.822]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[00:26:34.822 --> 00:26:38.286]  So I'm going to open the phones up now on three subjects.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.262]  And three subjects only, okay?
[00:26:42.262 --> 00:26:47.328]  And I'm asking listeners to stick to these subjects so we can focus in on them so I can get callers on these subjects.
[00:26:47.328 --> 00:26:58.420]  Because if we don't limit the subjects sometimes, I can't get the calls on those subjects because the phones fill up with people just wanting to plug their websites or talk about how I'm a reptoid or whatever.
[00:27:00.211 --> 00:27:24.350]  So, we can talk about the flu, and the incredible hype that the media is engaged in right now, basically saying it's the end of the world, forced inoculations, checkpoints, quarantines, globally, oh my gosh, a Texas Ranger has it, oh my gosh, you might cough, you might get a stomachache, we've gotta give you three shots, it doesn't even protect you from it, the flu's already mutated, but so what?
[00:27:26.089 --> 00:27:30.350]  I want to talk about all things flu, because this is looking worse and worse.
[00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.091]  This is looking bad.
[00:27:32.091 --> 00:27:37.513]  Not that it's even a real threat itself, but the vaccine and the forced inoculation.
[00:27:37.513 --> 00:27:40.834]  Also, NLE09, I want to discuss that.
[00:27:40.834 --> 00:27:42.394]  And Barack Obama.
[00:27:42.394 --> 00:27:44.415]  All things Barack Obama.
[00:27:44.415 --> 00:27:47.076]  His approval rating now dropping below 50 points.
[00:27:47.076 --> 00:27:47.756]  Rasmussen.
[00:27:48.857 --> 00:27:50.778]  They are in major spin control.
[00:27:50.778 --> 00:27:51.658]  They are panicked.
[00:27:51.658 --> 00:27:53.558]  They are afraid.
[00:27:53.558 --> 00:27:58.140]  This is really stalling on them faster than they even predicted.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.401]  You know, they said they had 200 days or so.
[00:28:02.401 --> 00:28:09.463]  We're now 150 days into this and they are in complete and total panic mode.
[00:28:09.463 --> 00:28:16.085]  They are really starting to figure it out now that the public isn't buying any of their propaganda and I want to break some of that down after the break.
[00:28:18.237 --> 00:28:19.497]  Here's some of the other flu news.
[00:28:19.497 --> 00:28:24.139]  Government's swine flu advisor on vaccine is on vaccine maker payroll.
[00:28:24.139 --> 00:28:27.140]  Well, of course, they all are.
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.941]  And let's just hope it's fear-mongering to sell tens of billions in deadly vaccine.
[00:28:30.941 --> 00:28:33.101]  That's bad enough.
[00:28:33.101 --> 00:28:43.164]  Let's really hope they don't know something about this manufactured virus and it's admitted it's made in a lab that we don't know and that they know it's going to mutate into something megadeath.
[00:28:43.164 --> 00:28:44.985]  But they're saying that's going to happen.
[00:28:44.985 --> 00:28:46.165]  Let's hope that's not the case.
[00:28:47.928 --> 00:28:58.592]  uh... also another report here uh... new york residents happy crazy cheney plan was axed there was a uh... report how they wanted to have the army come arrest u.s.
[00:28:58.592 --> 00:29:02.753]  citizens and it turned out they were completely innocent to set the precedent to use u.s.
[00:29:02.753 --> 00:29:03.873]  army on u.s.
[00:29:03.873 --> 00:29:13.916]  soil the Lackawanna Six so we'll go over some of that gates is saying iran is a threat to israel u.s.
[00:29:13.916 --> 00:29:15.037]  may have to go ahead and hit them
[00:29:15.979 --> 00:29:17.739]  That's another big crisis they can create.
[00:29:17.739 --> 00:29:20.700]  An attack on Iran.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:26.821]  Bunch of unemployment numbers coming in that will go over not just in the U.S., but worldwide.
[00:29:26.821 --> 00:29:28.942]  White House wants a new stimulus package.
[00:29:28.942 --> 00:29:31.182]  That means a new looting.
[00:29:31.182 --> 00:29:33.983]  So we'll have a big news blitz on the other side.
[00:29:33.983 --> 00:29:35.203]  Open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:39.471 --> 00:29:44.813]  The flu, martial law drills, NLEO-9, all things Obama.
[00:29:44.813 --> 00:29:47.535]  That is a huge field of issues to discuss.
[00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:48.875]  And I'm only taking calls on that.
[00:29:48.875 --> 00:29:50.796]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.796 --> 00:29:52.177]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.177 --> 00:29:54.718]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.718 --> 00:29:57.419]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.674 --> 00:30:02.355]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.355 --> 00:30:07.097]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:30:07.097 --> 00:30:10.059]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:30:10.059 --> 00:30:13.101]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:30:13.101 --> 00:30:18.944]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:22.426]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:30:22.426 --> 00:30:29.411]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:32.693]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:30:32.693 --> 00:30:34.574]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:44.103]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, prescribed and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:30:44.103 --> 00:30:47.868]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:47.868 --> 00:30:49.149]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:49.850]  Take action today.
[00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.672]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:31:01.457 --> 00:31:07.262]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.262 --> 00:31:14.849]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.849 --> 00:31:21.014]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.434 --> 00:31:23.395]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.395 --> 00:31:25.897]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.897 --> 00:31:37.485]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.485 --> 00:31:39.166]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.166 --> 00:31:41.028]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:41.028 --> 00:31:47.252]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:56.179]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.179 --> 00:31:57.761]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.761 --> 00:31:58.943]  The people strike back!
[00:32:00.794 --> 00:32:08.119]  If the current state of the economy is severely impacting your life, this might be some of the most important information you will ever hear.
[00:32:08.119 --> 00:32:16.105]  As the economy continues to spiral out of control, many people, just like you, wonder how they will support their family and pay their bills.
[00:32:16.105 --> 00:32:19.748]  The government is not going to help out the people who desperately need it.
[00:32:19.748 --> 00:32:21.609]  It's time for you to look outside the box
[00:32:21.749 --> 00:32:22.249]  I don't know.
[00:32:42.242 --> 00:32:43.203]  And the best part?
[00:32:43.203 --> 00:32:48.709]  This revolutionary book is priced under $10 and is only $6 for the e-book.
[00:32:48.709 --> 00:32:51.231]  Here's what you do to get Here's What You Do.
[00:32:51.231 --> 00:32:53.393]  Visit Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:32:53.393 --> 00:32:55.576]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:32:55.576 --> 00:32:57.578]  Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:32:57.578 --> 00:32:59.640]  And start changing your life today.
[00:33:17.287 --> 00:33:30.317]  Yeah, we want to love train, but the globalists don't.
[00:33:30.317 --> 00:33:42.346]  And they've got a Swiss Army knife of stage crises and false flags.
[00:33:42.346 --> 00:33:45.988]  You know, it's all another issue, but I've got to do a show on this in the near future on
[00:33:47.355 --> 00:33:53.864]  Persistent jet contrails, aerosol sprays, chemtrails as they're known.
[00:33:53.864 --> 00:33:59.832]  The common name for them.
[00:33:59.832 --> 00:34:05.079]  Because there is no doubt, and I've had meteorologists on, like the guy from Weather Wars.
[00:34:07.955 --> 00:34:08.235]  I think?
[00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.292]  In 1967, Stanford Research Institute.
[00:34:28.292 --> 00:34:30.033]  See, that's what Bill Gates is.
[00:34:30.033 --> 00:34:40.599]  They just give him existing technologies, and then he's just a government clandestine operative, a fake CEO.
[00:34:40.599 --> 00:34:45.483]  And I've been talking about that for a decade, now that's come out in mainstream news.
[00:34:45.483 --> 00:34:48.064]  That most of these big CEOs are just complete operatives.
[00:34:48.064 --> 00:34:48.905]  They're complete fronts.
[00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:57.173]  That's why they always give, you know, 90 plus percent of their money, tens of billions, to eugenics.
[00:34:57.173 --> 00:34:58.914]  Because that's State Department Memorandum 200.
[00:34:58.914 --> 00:35:02.256]  That is official policy from 1973.
[00:35:02.256 --> 00:35:09.501]  It's official British policy from 1949 on.
[00:35:09.501 --> 00:35:16.605]  So this is what they do, and the government can't openly own every corporation and every bank and every system.
[00:35:17.694 --> 00:35:20.075]  At least they couldn't back in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s.
[00:35:20.075 --> 00:35:32.118]  Now they just do it in the name of the economy and grab GM and Chrysler and everything else, but it's all part of continuity of government, all part of infrastructure protection.
[00:35:32.118 --> 00:35:34.458]  It's just a complete takeover.
[00:35:34.458 --> 00:35:35.138]  That's the issue.
[00:35:35.138 --> 00:35:37.599]  There's just billions of points I want to make.
[00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:45.101]  It is like a giant 3D hologram, false reality projected out, and you can go into every little area of the hologram.
[00:35:46.522 --> 00:35:55.504]  And zoom in on every little piece of it and see that it is a manufactured false reality.
[00:35:55.504 --> 00:36:01.685]  You know, we always use the analogy of saying, pull back and you can see the big picture.
[00:36:01.685 --> 00:36:02.845]  And that's one way to look at it.
[00:36:02.845 --> 00:36:14.848]  Yes, most people are so focused on their little petty system and petty desires and they don't have respect for themselves and they just kind of accept whatever is laid out before them, like rats in a maze.
[00:36:19.679 --> 00:36:22.202]  But there's another way to look at that.
[00:36:22.202 --> 00:36:33.714]  That people are looking at this projected matrix from far away in the back seat of the movie theater.
[00:36:33.714 --> 00:36:37.438]  They're not really paying attention.
[00:36:37.438 --> 00:36:40.121]  But if you walk right up to the movie screen,
[00:36:43.854 --> 00:36:47.075]  You can see the pixels of the projector.
[00:36:47.075 --> 00:36:49.655]  If it's a digital projector, and that's almost how it is.
[00:36:49.655 --> 00:37:02.038]  You can go up to any area of society, any area of government, anything that's just accepted knowledge, accepted reality, and if you go zoom in on it, you'll see incredible design, new world order handiwork.
[00:37:02.038 --> 00:37:05.599]  It's like matrix code or something.
[00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:08.079]  Is a good parable.
[00:37:08.079 --> 00:37:11.140]  A good way to boil it down.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.964]  And you find out they've got CIA and regular army in every major city and town.
[00:37:18.964 --> 00:37:22.447]  You find out they've got Pentagon-designed control grids.
[00:37:22.447 --> 00:37:32.736]  You find out the entire technological system we live under for at least 40 years has been designed to control every facet of our lives.
[00:37:32.736 --> 00:37:35.178]  You find out they are poisoning the water and food.
[00:37:35.178 --> 00:37:38.621]  You find out they are engineering the society completely.
[00:37:38.621 --> 00:37:40.503]  And it just makes your head spin.
[00:37:40.503 --> 00:37:41.324]  At least it does mine.
[00:37:42.697 --> 00:37:47.921]  Okay, I said I want to get to your phone calls.
[00:37:47.921 --> 00:37:51.084]  And I've got so much here, I'm kind of going in a hundred different directions.
[00:37:51.084 --> 00:37:58.691]  I'm going to just take calls till the bottom of the next hour, and then I'm going to get into NLE09 in some detail.
[00:37:58.691 --> 00:38:02.694]  I'm going to get into the flu situation that the picture is very clear now.
[00:38:02.694 --> 00:38:03.915]  They are moving.
[00:38:03.915 --> 00:38:05.897]  This is a massive operation.
[00:38:05.897 --> 00:38:08.038]  This is a staged operation.
[00:38:08.038 --> 00:38:10.621]  Specifically, what the endgame is, is not clear.
[00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:15.364]  But we've got three to four different scenarios.
[00:38:15.364 --> 00:38:17.065]  Three that are their scenarios.
[00:38:17.065 --> 00:38:19.887]  One scenario we can force.
[00:38:19.887 --> 00:38:23.189]  That is them pulling out.
[00:38:23.189 --> 00:38:26.151]  We know it's one of three bad scenarios.
[00:38:26.151 --> 00:38:29.594]  We know it's an operation.
[00:38:29.594 --> 00:38:33.216]  And we know all three of these scenarios are bad news.
[00:38:33.216 --> 00:38:33.897]  Bad news.
[00:38:33.897 --> 00:38:35.298]  And each one gets worse than the next.
[00:38:36.826 --> 00:38:41.149]  And then there's a fourth scenario we can force to get us out of this.
[00:38:41.149 --> 00:38:47.552]  And it'll be bad, but there'll be collateral damage with the idiots still taking the vaccine, a lot of them, but you can't help them.
[00:38:47.552 --> 00:38:53.176]  I mean, you can try to warn them not to go into the gas chambers, not to get on the trains.
[00:38:53.176 --> 00:38:56.878]  That's basically what this is, but it's a camouflage soft kill weapon.
[00:38:56.878 --> 00:39:01.401]  It's like a woman called in at the end of the show yesterday.
[00:39:03.209 --> 00:39:09.993]  And she was talking about how she told her daughter, don't give our granddaughter the Gardasil Merck shot.
[00:39:09.993 --> 00:39:16.077]  And she gave it to her and then she got the bloody spots all over and now has an autoimmune disease.
[00:39:16.077 --> 00:39:19.419]  And it's clear that's what the vaccine is designed to do.
[00:39:19.419 --> 00:39:21.661]  Because that's what it does.
[00:39:21.661 --> 00:39:26.524]  And some people are even more susceptible and the soft kill just goes ahead and becomes a hard kill and kills them immediately.
[00:39:28.885 --> 00:39:30.706]  And by the way, I don't do this with enjoyment.
[00:39:30.706 --> 00:39:44.356]  ABC News has reported that Merck, quote, has hit teams and seek and destroy teams that came out in federal documents in a federal lawsuit to, quote, go to people's homes and eliminate them.
[00:39:44.356 --> 00:39:48.639]  And the media spun that two months ago as, oh, they meant that figuratively.
[00:39:48.639 --> 00:39:50.600]  No, they don't mean that figuratively.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.582]  I don't enjoy going up against Merck.
[00:39:53.582 --> 00:39:56.324]  I mean, if they'll shoot little girls up with something they know is going to kill them,
[00:39:58.206 --> 00:40:06.400]  The only reason they don't kill me is because they don't want to put a big giant underline under all the work I do.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.624]  But believe me, this isn't fun.
[00:40:08.624 --> 00:40:11.489]  I'm doing this because I gotta warn people.
[00:40:12.503 --> 00:40:18.367]  And I've got a passion to get on more AM and FM stations and shortwave and satellite and internet to warn these people.
[00:40:18.367 --> 00:40:20.308]  I care about people, folks.
[00:40:20.308 --> 00:40:28.214]  I want to just walk up to people in restaurants and in shopping malls and in grocery stores and on the street and say, please don't vaccinate your children.
[00:40:29.136 --> 00:40:31.858]  Please, please don't give your daughter Gardasil.
[00:40:31.858 --> 00:40:35.882]  You have such an innocent, lovely, sweet daughter, and now they want to force it on boys?
[00:40:35.882 --> 00:40:39.325]  You have such a good, handsome, smart son.
[00:40:39.325 --> 00:40:42.667]  He's got such potential and such destiny in his eyes.
[00:40:42.667 --> 00:40:44.909]  Please don't let them soft kill your son.
[00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:49.093]  But I know they're preconditioned slave minds, and they just aren't ready for it.
[00:40:49.093 --> 00:40:50.754]  Because that is crazy sounding.
[00:40:50.754 --> 00:40:56.299]  It is crazy to have Holdren running around writing 1,100-page textbooks about how to put poison in the water.
[00:40:56.579 --> 00:40:58.621]  But it's real, man!
[00:40:58.621 --> 00:41:01.625]  Don't you understand this isn't a game?
[00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:05.850]  It's real they've got Ukrainian troops running checkpoints in Scotland.
[00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:13.598]  And it's real they're going to have unannounced checkpoints, we're already getting reports of them, where police pull you over and then foreign troops come over and search you.
[00:41:13.598 --> 00:41:16.782]  It's dog training, it's like training a puppy how to bird hunt.
[00:41:18.592 --> 00:41:20.053]  They're just getting them all geared up.
[00:41:20.053 --> 00:41:21.173]  This is sick!
[00:41:21.173 --> 00:41:28.356]  They're trampling all over us and doing simulated foreign troop flag planting on our country!
[00:41:28.356 --> 00:41:29.917]  It's real, folks!
[00:41:29.917 --> 00:41:31.017]  I've been there!
[00:41:31.017 --> 00:41:40.821]  I've witnessed Marines training to put American citizens on their knees and shoot you in the back of the head!
[00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:41.542]  It's just so real.
[00:41:43.706 --> 00:41:50.393]  And it almost lessens it that I even do a radio show, that I even have sponsors and joke around with my producers.
[00:41:50.393 --> 00:42:02.184]  But I'm a human, I've gotta... I'm like everybody else, I like to joke around, I like to have fun, I like to go out to eat, I like to go to movies, I like to go hunting, I like to live!
[00:42:02.184 --> 00:42:07.649]  But that is a sick response to this.
[00:42:07.649 --> 00:42:08.170]  You can't!
[00:42:09.508 --> 00:42:19.958]  You can't go on through your life like anything else matters when you know they're poisoning the water and the food and got weather weapon systems causing droughts, admittedly.
[00:42:19.958 --> 00:42:23.261]  Now, you do have to compartmentalize a little bit and have some R&R.
[00:42:23.261 --> 00:42:30.347]  But when you're R&Ring, admit to yourself, I'm compartmentalizing and going out and having some fun and ignoring what else is going on.
[00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:31.989]  Because it is sick!
[00:42:31.989 --> 00:42:32.769]  See, what happens is,
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:41.764]  The people have been trained to compartmentalize the real, serious issues and compartmentalize them to a point where they don't even care and it doesn't even exist.
[00:42:41.764 --> 00:42:45.526]  To where it's like a tiny pinpoint of reality in your life.
[00:42:45.526 --> 00:42:58.113]  You need to expand that pinpoint to where the R&R is a small area of your life and the petty issues and the things that don't matter are a small part of your life and you gotta have it.
[00:42:59.656 --> 00:43:12.062]  I do everything I can, you know, a couple times a year to take a few days off and go lay out in the sun and go fishing and, you know, swim around and body surf or boogie board.
[00:43:12.062 --> 00:43:14.783]  And it feeds the soul and you need to do it.
[00:43:14.783 --> 00:43:18.084]  Or to get out a canvas and, you know, do an oil painting.
[00:43:18.084 --> 00:43:18.945]  Spend a few hours.
[00:43:18.945 --> 00:43:24.988]  But I've gone to the extreme point of not even really doing that because every minute is so precious.
[00:43:24.988 --> 00:43:27.829]  Every minute I'm even alive to be here warning you is so precious.
[00:43:36.551 --> 00:43:42.526]  And all I'm saying is we gotta get our priorities straight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:42.526 --> 00:43:43.950]  We gotta get our priorities straight.
[00:43:44.872 --> 00:44:05.782]  I mean, we got a scientific dictatorship coming down on us, and whether you're an auto mechanic, or a dentist, or a doctor, or a school teacher, or a refinery worker, or a roughneck out in the oil fields, or whether you are a janitor, whether you are a truck driver, it doesn't matter whether you're a professional baseball player or a Hollywood movie star, 99.99% of us
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:10.540]  I don't know.
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:14.281]  Guys, do some division for me in there on the calculator.
[00:44:14.281 --> 00:44:19.243]  Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, who we interviewed, he came on saying, oh, we want to talk to your audience.
[00:44:19.243 --> 00:44:21.383]  Yeah, we know who you are, Mr. Jones.
[00:44:21.383 --> 00:44:22.643]  You know, we want a world government.
[00:44:22.643 --> 00:44:23.664]  We want to go ahead and talk to you.
[00:44:23.664 --> 00:44:26.505]  We believe the world government's the way to go.
[00:44:26.505 --> 00:44:27.485]  He won't come back on now.
[00:44:27.485 --> 00:44:29.405]  He didn't like how I thrashed him on air.
[00:44:29.405 --> 00:44:34.467]  We tried to have him back on, but he wrote a big article for the Washington Post saying, we're the super class.
[00:44:34.467 --> 00:44:37.488]  6,000 of us rule the planet for 20 families.
[00:44:37.488 --> 00:44:38.228]  And that's about right.
[00:44:39.255 --> 00:44:44.098]  So what is 6,000 divided into 6.5 billion?
[00:44:44.098 --> 00:44:46.739]  Because that's the numbers.
[00:44:46.739 --> 00:44:48.640]  You may get a lot of money and a lot of power.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.761]  Millions a year out of serving these bastards.
[00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:57.265]  They're still putting sodium fluoride and 100 plus other poisons in your water on purpose.
[00:44:57.265 --> 00:44:58.886]  They're still spraying stuff into the air.
[00:45:00.465 --> 00:45:02.546]  We're good to go.
[00:45:22.914 --> 00:45:26.795]  There's a lot of different attack profiles we've proven with top geneticists here on the show.
[00:45:26.795 --> 00:45:28.015]  You know, that's going on.
[00:45:28.015 --> 00:45:36.258]  And I'm sorry, once you realize that, the peer pressure of being in the cop shop and, you know, dealing with dirty citizens all day, it's over.
[00:45:36.258 --> 00:45:39.439]  You're in the same boat with us.
[00:45:39.439 --> 00:45:44.640]  You're some local government pimp, getting side contracts and stealing money to do what the bankers say.
[00:45:46.803 --> 00:45:54.067]  Does that fancy house and the big bank account mean crap next to the fact that your kid's at the doctor every week and has health problems?
[00:45:54.067 --> 00:45:57.189]  Or the fact that your 20-year-old daughter has got thyroid problems?
[00:45:57.189 --> 00:46:03.052]  Almost every woman I talk to has got their hair falling out and doesn't even eat food but are overweight.
[00:46:03.052 --> 00:46:07.694]  They all got thyroid problems because of what you're being fed and what you're eating and what they're spraying on you.
[00:46:07.694 --> 00:46:09.015]  I mean, is this really fun?
[00:46:09.015 --> 00:46:10.376]  Do you really like this?
[00:46:14.987 --> 00:46:22.949]  All the money, all the fake fame doesn't mean anything if you don't know what the real reality is and if you don't, if you aren't in the driver's seat of your destiny.
[00:46:22.949 --> 00:46:26.690]  And I'm telling you, these 6,000 scumbags, do we have the math?
[00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:27.551]  6,000 divided into 6,500,000,000?
[00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:30.531]  Do the math, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:30.531 --> 00:46:35.653]  99.999, I would imagine, is what the number's gonna come out to.
[00:46:48.424 --> 00:47:01.092]  I mean, we are all here being dumbed down and we spend all our time watching TV and sucked into the computers and sucked into this false reality to the point that we can hardly communicate with each other anymore.
[00:47:01.092 --> 00:47:02.593]  We can hardly do math.
[00:47:02.593 --> 00:47:04.654]  We can hardly spell or write anymore.
[00:47:04.654 --> 00:47:05.435]  All of us!
[00:47:05.435 --> 00:47:06.736]  We're wrecks!
[00:47:06.736 --> 00:47:11.879]  The elite have wrecked us through their eugenics to make us defenseless so they can have their way with us.
[00:47:19.022 --> 00:47:22.644]  Let's go ahead and take some calls, and I'm going to go through it all later.
[00:47:22.644 --> 00:47:24.204]  Jason in Washington, you're on the air.
[00:47:24.204 --> 00:47:29.227]  Okay, he hung up.
[00:47:29.227 --> 00:47:31.328]  Dee in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[00:47:31.328 --> 00:47:32.568]  Dee, go ahead.
[00:47:32.568 --> 00:47:34.289]  Hi, Alex.
[00:47:34.289 --> 00:47:35.189]  Go ahead, Dee.
[00:47:35.189 --> 00:47:36.150]  Love your show.
[00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.610]  Thank you.
[00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.351]  I guess this has to do with two out of your three things.
[00:47:39.351 --> 00:47:42.413]  Obama's one of them, and the flu thing's another one.
[00:47:44.105 --> 00:47:46.747]  I don't know, this is kind of reminiscent of 2001.
[00:47:46.747 --> 00:47:50.510]  They had a big ol' flu scare.
[00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:53.572]  And then, of course, we had 9-11 that fall.
[00:47:53.572 --> 00:47:55.933]  I'm kind of wondering if that ain't a possibility somewhere.
[00:47:55.933 --> 00:47:57.194]  You know what?
[00:47:57.194 --> 00:47:59.956]  The false flag... Hang on.
[00:47:59.956 --> 00:48:10.683]  Given that they're talking about attacking Iran or letting Israel do it, I think something big is going to happen, and it might be... It'll have to be bigger than 9-11.
[00:48:12.128 --> 00:48:14.389]  Yeah, I thought that was a question, that's why I was chiming in.
[00:48:14.389 --> 00:48:17.471]  I mean, those are great points.
[00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:20.233]  What's your point on Obama?
[00:48:20.233 --> 00:48:23.595]  I got woke up through Ralph Nader just before the election.
[00:48:23.595 --> 00:48:27.197]  Actually, Biden kind of woke me up on my own.
[00:48:27.197 --> 00:48:38.464]  The whole thing started with the Israeli-Palestinian issue, but when I researched it and traced it, it goes back to the same eugenicists and the whole scum, the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and the rest of them.
[00:48:39.423 --> 00:48:41.125]  It all ties back there.
[00:48:41.125 --> 00:48:42.766]  Everything ties into that.
[00:48:42.766 --> 00:48:49.353]  Yeah, and that's how I got woke up to you with starting researching the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
[00:48:49.353 --> 00:48:52.476]  And then this Holdren guy, and people are so
[00:48:53.658 --> 00:48:57.240]  Do the sheeple thing because I think that just describes a lot of the public.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.281]  Obama!
[00:48:58.281 --> 00:48:59.261]  Like you do it.
[00:48:59.261 --> 00:49:02.643]  Obama!
[00:49:02.643 --> 00:49:03.643]  Obama!
[00:49:03.643 --> 00:49:08.506]  What they do is they rationalize, and like a child, and ma'am I appreciate your call.
[00:49:08.506 --> 00:49:09.086]  Good to hear from you.
[00:49:09.086 --> 00:49:17.271]  Great points, Dee.
[00:49:17.271 --> 00:49:21.333]  Now this is a very, very important point.
[00:49:26.283 --> 00:49:45.998]  A three-year-old girl or boy will dress up, a little boy will dress up like Space Captain, or like a Star Wars person, and a little girl will dress up like a princess and put a little plastic crown on, and it's, you know, little girls love, it's very popular, and they will believe they're a princess while they're walking around with plastic jewels on.
[00:49:45.998 --> 00:49:48.160]  And I liken that to adults.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:53.184]  You're supposed to make believe and have imaginary friends and be delusional when you're a child.
[00:49:54.787 --> 00:50:01.071]  But by the time I was three and a half, I was aware that that was delusion.
[00:50:01.071 --> 00:50:05.033]  So imagine I was Batman jumping around on my back porch with my friend.
[00:50:05.033 --> 00:50:07.395]  Batman and Robin.
[00:50:07.395 --> 00:50:14.339]  And other kids thought I was weird because I didn't really want to pretend anymore because I'd figured out it wasn't real.
[00:50:14.339 --> 00:50:17.000]  But see, adults are engaged in delusion.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.963]  They just think if they say, oh, they're not putting poison in my water, that it suddenly is not there.
[00:50:22.546 --> 00:50:25.007]  Or they're not going to stage a terror attack.
[00:50:25.007 --> 00:50:26.287]  Governments don't stage terror attacks.
[00:50:26.287 --> 00:50:31.369]  It doesn't matter if you hand them a stack of mainstream news articles where it's declassified, they do.
[00:50:31.369 --> 00:50:36.430]  They believe that if they just say reality is one way, that makes it that way.
[00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:38.531]  They're delusional.
[00:50:38.531 --> 00:50:41.631]  And they're so selfish, they don't even save themselves.
[00:50:41.631 --> 00:50:44.752]  They're so selfish and delusional, they just lie to themselves.
[00:50:44.752 --> 00:50:46.633]  And that is one of the biggest issues.
[00:50:46.633 --> 00:50:49.634]  Birdman, George, Bill, and many others, your calls are straight ahead, 1-800.
[00:50:51.814 --> 00:50:52.135]  2-5-9-92-31.
[00:50:52.135 --> 00:50:58.994]  They are certainly hyping up this flu right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:04.920]  Berkey water systems are the most trusted name in water filtration available on the market.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:22.230]  The revolutionary Berkey Light self-sterilizing and recleanable purification elements purify water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and by extracting harmful chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, VOCs, organic solvents, radon-222, and trihalomethanes.
[00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:26.893]  They also reduce nitrates, nitrites, sediment, and unhealthy minerals such as lead and mercury.
[00:51:27.313 --> 00:51:34.458]  As an authorized dealer for over four years serving thousands of satisfied customers, we offer amazing specials for Berkey Light water systems.
[00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:42.685]  Order the Berkey Light system today and we'll include two black Berkey Elements and three Sport Berkey water bottles for only $209 with free shipping.
[00:51:42.685 --> 00:51:48.509]  That's right, free shipping and three Sport Berkey water bottles at $89 value, free for a limited time.
[00:51:48.889 --> 00:51:50.471]  Just call the Berkey Guy at 877-886-3653 now to order.
[00:51:50.471 --> 00:51:53.195]  That's the Berkey Guy at 877-886-3653 or visit our website at Directed21.com.
[00:52:01.548 --> 00:52:07.590]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:13.473]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:52:13.473 --> 00:52:19.635]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:19.975 --> 00:52:21.936]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:21.936 --> 00:52:24.397]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:24.397 --> 00:52:37.583]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:52:37.583 --> 00:52:39.264]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.264 --> 00:52:41.125]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:41.125 --> 00:52:47.348]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:48.032 --> 00:52:56.286]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.286 --> 00:52:57.869]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.869 --> 00:52:59.071]  The people strike back.
[00:53:16.749 --> 00:53:17.830]  We're good to go!
[00:53:43.302 --> 00:53:45.203]  Come, you masters of war Hear the bell of the big guns
[00:54:18.592 --> 00:54:20.073]  Let's go to Birdman in Florida.
[00:54:20.073 --> 00:54:21.594]  Birdman, you're on the air.
[00:54:21.594 --> 00:54:25.196]  Let him go.
[00:54:25.196 --> 00:54:28.258]  He's not going to talk.
[00:54:28.258 --> 00:54:29.939]  Let's talk to George in Arizona.
[00:54:29.939 --> 00:54:31.860]  George, you're on the air.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:32.060]  Welcome.
[00:54:37.999 --> 00:54:39.960]  You know, what happens if this drill never ends?
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:44.224]  I mean, we're pretending, you know, they are pretending to go into martial law.
[00:54:44.224 --> 00:54:45.346]  What if we never come out?
[00:54:45.346 --> 00:54:53.954]  You know, I think it was you who said that Henry Kissinger said that in September 2009, American people will not be able to own firearms.
[00:54:53.954 --> 00:54:56.196]  So, you know, this thing looks kind of dangerous to me.
[00:54:58.066 --> 00:55:04.007]  Well, what they do is they do drills, and they do them as test balloons to see if we'll buy it.
[00:55:04.007 --> 00:55:06.928]  And if they don't get resistance to it, they expand it.
[00:55:06.928 --> 00:55:23.131]  And yes, we are under martial law when 99% of the American people don't want a bank or bailout, and Congress won't pass it, so martial law is threatened.
[00:55:23.131 --> 00:55:25.232]  They said, do this or
[00:55:26.758 --> 00:55:29.921]  We will shut you down.
[00:55:29.921 --> 00:55:38.650]  And people thought I was lying when I played the C-SPAN clip because we were the first people to kind of point it out and make a big deal out of it.
[00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:46.638]  And notice, day after day, week after week, month after month, we will break something or push it out into major attention.
[00:55:47.529 --> 00:55:55.872]  And then we always get blamed for lying, and then later it comes out we were right, like really being at level six with the World Health Organization.
[00:55:55.872 --> 00:56:00.313]  We told people that back in April, and that was admitted two months later.
[00:56:00.313 --> 00:56:04.754]  So, we're already under martial law.
[00:56:04.754 --> 00:56:07.055]  That's why the police have been issued tasers.
[00:56:07.055 --> 00:56:09.076]  That's why they've been told, crack down on the public.
[00:56:09.076 --> 00:56:10.556]  Let them know you're boss.
[00:56:10.556 --> 00:56:11.736]  That's why they're putting CIA and
[00:56:14.085 --> 00:56:18.692]  Regular Army into every local threat fusion center.
[00:56:18.692 --> 00:56:26.825]  It's just they're ratcheting up the level of martial law that we're under and now acclimating the local police departments to accept foreign troops.
[00:56:29.912 --> 00:56:34.215]  About a month ago, you said that the Israeli Army was in Tucson.
[00:56:34.215 --> 00:56:35.936]  And I laughed at you, okay?
[00:56:35.936 --> 00:56:42.260]  So the next day, I went to a Pima County gun range to do some shooting.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:47.403]  And the man next to me was an Israeli soldier in his BDU.
[00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:53.387]  He had his black boots on, camouflaged pants, and his t-shirt said, Israeli Defense Force.
[00:56:53.387 --> 00:56:55.869]  And I almost passed out.
[00:56:55.869 --> 00:56:57.770]  I said, God, Alex was right.
[00:56:58.562 --> 00:57:06.484]  And this guy, you know, he's talking to me and he said he'll be here six months and, uh, you know, he brought his wife a pistol and he's shooting his guns.
[00:57:06.484 --> 00:57:09.584]  You know, I had three pistols and an AK-47.
[00:57:09.584 --> 00:57:16.426]  And, um, uh, but I knew immediately what was going on just because of your comments.
[00:57:16.426 --> 00:57:19.026]  And I wanted to thank you for it.
[00:57:19.026 --> 00:57:21.307]  I was extremely upset.
[00:57:21.307 --> 00:57:24.547]  I knew, you know, by your hint, you told me what was going on.
[00:57:24.547 --> 00:57:26.128]  And that happened a month ago.
[00:57:26.128 --> 00:57:27.408]  Thanks for your help.
[00:57:29.264 --> 00:57:31.424]  Well, sir, oh, he hung up.
[00:57:31.424 --> 00:57:36.385]  I wanted to let George in Arizona finish up what he was saying.
[00:57:36.385 --> 00:57:39.226]  George, call back in if you can get an open line.
[00:57:39.226 --> 00:57:40.206]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:57:40.206 --> 00:57:47.168]  Sir, this is what happens to everybody.
[00:57:47.168 --> 00:57:54.829]  I was not just saying that Israeli troops are part of the exercise.
[00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:58.270]  That was from FEMA's own website.
[00:57:59.929 --> 00:58:03.171]  In fact, let me just read this to people.
[00:58:03.171 --> 00:58:09.253]  I mean, I'm not just saying Ukrainian troops every year come into England and Scotland and pull citizens out of their cars.
[00:58:09.253 --> 00:58:13.455]  BBC headline, Ukrainian Marine Stop Drivers.
[00:58:13.455 --> 00:58:20.399]  Here's the, just type this into a search engine, National Level Exercise 2009, NLE09.
[00:58:20.399 --> 00:58:27.122]  This is a FEMA press release, third paragraph, and it talks about the foreign troops, and then
[00:58:28.188 --> 00:58:30.951]  I have another article here in my stack about the Israeli troops.
[00:58:30.951 --> 00:58:37.037]  I was only reading from FEMA's own website.
[00:58:37.037 --> 00:58:37.538]  Stay there.
[00:58:37.538 --> 00:58:42.543]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:58:42.543 --> 00:58:45.145]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.145 --> 00:58:48.369]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.418 --> 00:58:54.659]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.659 --> 00:58:56.659]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.659 --> 00:59:05.181]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.181 --> 00:59:10.723]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.723 --> 00:59:12.343]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.583 --> 00:59:19.109]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:30.160]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:30.940]  That's right.
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:33.503]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.503 --> 00:59:35.084]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:59:37.026 --> 00:59:37.466]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:08.283]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.283 --> 01:00:10.044]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.044 --> 01:00:11.624]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.624 --> 01:00:12.564]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.564 --> 01:00:17.365]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.365 --> 01:00:21.626]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.626 --> 01:00:30.167]  We're going to continue with open phones and covering tons of important news and information in this hour.
[01:00:30.167 --> 01:00:35.148]  Then we've got Attorney Phil Berg, one of the chief individuals out there exposing Obama's
[01:00:37.608 --> 01:00:42.892]  Deceptive behavior concerning his birth certificate.
[01:00:42.892 --> 01:00:49.896]  And then coming up in the hour after that, we have a pastor who's been very critical and gotten national attention.
[01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:51.678]  He's been very critical of Barack Obama.
[01:00:51.678 --> 01:00:58.022]  He'll be on with us for 30 minutes, Reverend James Manning.
[01:00:58.022 --> 01:01:00.824]  We just had a caller, George in Arizona, call in.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:16.644]  When he said he heard me a month ago talking about Israeli troops, amongst others, to be involved in martial law drills during NLE09 that started today.
[01:01:16.644 --> 01:01:18.345]  This is from FEMA's own website.
[01:01:21.175 --> 01:01:26.998]  And I know sometimes on air you may have just heard a show where I mentioned it and didn't give a source, but that's why I try to neurotically.
[01:01:26.998 --> 01:01:30.420]  Some people complain and say I stop too much and give sources.
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.701]  And it does kind of break the flow.
[01:01:31.701 --> 01:01:37.984]  I'm a decent orator, decent talk show host, but half the time now I'm just sourcing, sourcing, sourcing.
[01:01:37.984 --> 01:01:50.511]  Because when I get up here and tell you the White House science czar openly says he wants to poison the water to sterilize you and reduce the world's population and bring in world government to enforce it, I mean, we write articles and scan the book and link to it and
[01:01:51.704 --> 01:01:53.306]  People still don't believe us.
[01:01:53.306 --> 01:02:06.257]  We break the DHS report saying veterans are the number one terror threat, and Homeland Security set up to take them on, and we link to New York Times articles where they're training 14-year-olds with M16s to take on vets in black uniforms.
[01:02:06.257 --> 01:02:10.621]  I mean, I'm not making up kids in black uniforms training to take on gun owners.
[01:02:10.621 --> 01:02:15.106]  I mean, you can't make this up!
[01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:17.228]  Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, I live here too.
[01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:22.237]  I mean, I remember that people would call me when I first got on air.
[01:02:22.237 --> 01:02:24.958]  I was kind of a mainline Republican.
[01:02:24.958 --> 01:02:29.639]  I'm a libertarian Ron Paul stripe.
[01:02:29.639 --> 01:02:31.940]  And I got an education from listeners.
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:37.382]  I knew about the New World Order and the global banks and things, but I didn't know how deep the rabbit hole went.
[01:02:37.382 --> 01:02:40.623]  I kind of ignored the quote French stuff, like black helicopters.
[01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:44.304]  Because I heard the media say, anybody that talks about military drills is insane.
[01:02:45.319 --> 01:02:54.245]  And then they started blowing up buildings and terrorizing and shooting into buildings and crashing in Houston and trying to pay off city managers and police chiefs.
[01:02:54.245 --> 01:03:06.133]  And I went and interviewed a police chief in San Antonio, of San Antonio, and I went and interviewed emergency managers and city managers, and they said, yeah, foreign troops are here doing gun confiscation drills, but I'm not allowed to tell you anymore.
[01:03:07.298 --> 01:03:21.351]  And I'd go on air and talk about it and play interviews with police chiefs and mayors and city managers and I'd get made fun of by the local Austin American statesman, would say I was insane and it didn't exist.
[01:03:21.351 --> 01:03:25.375]  And I said, well what else is the media saying isn't real that is?
[01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:26.096]  And let me tell you,
[01:03:27.048 --> 01:03:30.431]  Listen to me, police, driving along in your squad car right now.
[01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:35.296]  Do you like somebody putting over a hundred chemicals in your water to brain damage you?
[01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:38.379]  You think that's funny and cute and you think I'm making that up?
[01:03:38.379 --> 01:03:41.182]  Go ahead and laugh at your own peril, pal.
[01:03:41.182 --> 01:03:47.288]  But if you've got any sixth sense, any survival mechanisms, any guts, you should.
[01:03:47.288 --> 01:03:48.008]  We come from pretty
[01:03:48.749 --> 01:03:50.150]  Amazing people.
[01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:58.772]  No matter how you came to the United States, this is a piratical, swashbuckling, war-like, but also very intelligent and hard-working stock.
[01:03:58.772 --> 01:04:00.473]  You come from pretty good people.
[01:04:00.473 --> 01:04:05.835]  And I can't believe you don't have the instincts and the intelligence to understand I'm telling you the truth.
[01:04:05.835 --> 01:04:09.316]  I mean, even if you hadn't looked at the facts, I'm laying out here, pal.
[01:04:10.976 --> 01:04:15.138]  Don't you somewhere in your gut have the hair on the back of your neck standing up right now?
[01:04:15.138 --> 01:04:16.779]  Don't you know I'm telling you the truth?
[01:04:16.779 --> 01:04:19.760]  Don't you know when the truth runs right over you?
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:25.883]  Don't you know when somebody stands up and puts a hand out to you and says, listen to me, buddy, this isn't a game.
[01:04:25.883 --> 01:04:30.105]  I don't have time to talk sweet to you or kiss your butt to get you to wake up.
[01:04:30.105 --> 01:04:32.486]  We got serious stuff coming down on us.
[01:04:32.486 --> 01:04:37.128]  Revenge of the Nerds, a bunch of control freak scientists financed by bankers.
[01:04:37.768 --> 01:04:44.855]  Playing God on us, and we're all in the same boat together, and it's time to wake up!
[01:04:44.855 --> 01:04:47.677]  Now, if you don't know, I'm telling you the truth.
[01:04:47.677 --> 01:04:55.305]  You need to swipe yourself upside the head, or take a cold shower, or jump in the river, or do something.
[01:04:55.305 --> 01:04:57.226]  Because this stuff's real.
[01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.668]  Come back, take more calls, stay with me.
[01:05:00.359 --> 01:05:05.666]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:10.212]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.212 --> 01:05:12.495]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.495 --> 01:05:14.097]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.097 --> 01:05:15.139]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:23.785]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:05:23.785 --> 01:05:31.251]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:06:00.643 --> 01:06:05.606]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:06:30.643 --> 01:06:30.963]  I think?
[01:07:01.462 --> 01:07:04.485]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:04.485 --> 01:07:09.811]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:09.811 --> 01:07:11.853]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:11.853 --> 01:07:16.859]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:16.859 --> 01:07:17.159]  How much
[01:07:17.159 --> 01:07:18.039]  Which do you want?
[01:07:18.039 --> 01:07:19.159]  When do you want it?
[01:07:19.159 --> 01:07:21.040]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.120]  When will you need it?
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.321]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:07:24.321 --> 01:07:25.661]  Will there be any food?
[01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:27.181]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:07:27.181 --> 01:07:32.442]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:07:32.442 --> 01:07:36.043]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:07:36.043 --> 01:07:39.504]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:07:39.844 --> 01:07:41.084]  How much will you need?
[01:07:41.084 --> 01:07:41.985]  We don't know.
[01:07:41.985 --> 01:07:43.085]  How much do you want?
[01:07:43.085 --> 01:07:44.025]  All you can get.
[01:07:44.025 --> 01:07:45.106]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:45.106 --> 01:07:48.167]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:07:48.167 --> 01:07:49.927]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:49.927 --> 01:07:50.847]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:08:02.313 --> 01:08:08.934]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.934 --> 01:08:21.817]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.817 --> 01:08:26.418]  Continuing our expose of the scientific dictatorship, massive news blitz coming up.
[01:08:28.141 --> 01:08:29.984]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:08:44.502 --> 01:08:59.717]  Well, you're so informed about so many things, you probably know this, but you were talking about the Gardasil vaccine earlier, and I don't know if you know that the FDA allowed Merck to put poisonous aluminum in the placebo in their clinical trials.
[01:09:01.724 --> 01:09:12.889]  I remember having some medical doctors on three years ago when all the women were dying or having seizures or having autoimmune diseases erupt when they were taking it.
[01:09:12.889 --> 01:09:18.311]  We tried to warn people, but of course we don't reach that many people compared to all the TV ads they ran.
[01:09:18.311 --> 01:09:28.276]  I knew that they got Rick Perry paid off to quote make it mandatory, which was another fraud, just to put it on the list of vaccines they tell the poor school kids are mandatory when they're not.
[01:09:29.116 --> 01:09:37.266]  And so that vaccine protection fund would kick in, because when the government mandates a vaccine, then the vaccine damage slush fund.
[01:09:37.266 --> 01:09:43.474]  So they knew it was a drug killing people, and they don't care, because they're eugenicists.
[01:09:43.474 --> 01:09:46.318]  But go ahead and make your point about that.
[01:09:47.469 --> 01:10:00.741]  Well, I think that most of us learned in high school that a placebo is supposed to be the harmless, do-nothing substance that helps scientists figure out what some other substance that might be doing something is doing.
[01:10:00.741 --> 01:10:06.367]  And if you're going to put aluminum in the placebo, then that's clearly fraud, scientifically.
[01:10:08.266 --> 01:10:12.829]  Sure, and they also, in a lot of those studies, allow them to put the squalene and other things in.
[01:10:12.829 --> 01:10:17.492]  And the more doctors I talk to, it's not even the mercury in the vaccines that's bad.
[01:10:17.492 --> 01:10:18.733]  It's not good.
[01:10:18.733 --> 01:10:20.974]  But that itself is a red herring.
[01:10:20.974 --> 01:10:23.656]  But if I can convince people not to take shots because of mercury, you know...
[01:10:25.365 --> 01:10:27.466]  I mean, more power to that information.
[01:10:27.466 --> 01:10:39.409]  That it's really the squalene and things that cause the big autoimmune response that then cause the brain and organs to swell that's causing the brain damage and other medical problems.
[01:10:39.409 --> 01:10:44.650]  And that's not Alex Jones, that's the medical doctors after medical doctor and the studies.
[01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:47.431]  And then, of course, all the RNA and the DNA.
[01:10:48.433 --> 01:10:53.996]  Every time I mention there's viruses in the vaccines, I get emails going, viruses have RNA not DNA.
[01:10:53.996 --> 01:11:04.302]  Yes, I know that there are other DNA sequences from the fetuses, from the monkeys, from the different
[01:11:05.851 --> 01:11:11.935]  Tissues, both human and animal, that are used to grow the viruses.
[01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:17.379]  See, other things are growing in this, not just the particular virus they're looking for.
[01:11:17.379 --> 01:11:27.686]  And so, if you're growing this in pig tissue, or rhesus monkey, or green monkey tissue, or fetal tissue, there are other viruses and other microplasms in there.
[01:11:27.686 --> 01:11:32.109]  And there's all sorts of mutations and things happening, and that's being injected into your body.
[01:11:32.109 --> 01:11:32.590]  Anything else, sir?
[01:11:34.127 --> 01:11:43.154]  Well, yeah, I guess you just mentioned so many different animal tissues that vaccines come from.
[01:11:43.154 --> 01:11:46.576]  Monkey tissues and aborted human fetal cell tissues.
[01:11:46.576 --> 01:11:52.300]  So, I mean, one, if you're a vegetarian, you might want to not get a vaccine.
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:12:00.206]  And two, if you don't like having aborted fetal cell tissues from human beings injected into your body, then that might be another consideration.
[01:12:01.252 --> 01:12:02.192]  It's insane.
[01:12:02.192 --> 01:12:03.113]  I appreciate your call.
[01:12:03.113 --> 01:12:04.253]  Great points.
[01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:17.139]  We're gonna go to more calls in a moment, but I do just want to add that this stuff is so strange that it even boggles my mind.
[01:12:17.139 --> 01:12:26.403]  One way I break people's conditioning, I found the last two years, is if I'm at dinner with somebody who's laughing at me, there's always now a laptop or computer nearby or an iPhone.
[01:12:28.089 --> 01:12:34.191]  I'll say, okay, you don't have a problem with genetic engineering and GMO food.
[01:12:34.191 --> 01:12:35.731]  They're like, yeah, it's no big deal.
[01:12:35.731 --> 01:12:37.452]  They've been doing that for thousands of years.
[01:12:37.452 --> 01:12:39.032]  No.
[01:12:39.032 --> 01:12:49.835]  Breeding a dog has been done for thousands of years, but they take the basic genetic code that's there and then manipulate it through the practice of breeding, but it's all still the same DNA.
[01:12:51.277 --> 01:13:10.127]  When you take cross-species, plant and animal and insect, and mix them all together and then put them into DNA sequences, and then put viruses into DNA sequences, and RNA into DNA sequences, and mitochondrial DNA into DNA sequences that are non-mitochondrial.
[01:13:10.127 --> 01:13:16.290]  I mean, this is some dangerous stuff, according to top genetic engineers we've interviewed, giving rise to superviruses and other things.
[01:13:17.412 --> 01:13:25.818]  And supercarriers and cross-species bridging from other zoological viruses and bacteria to humans.
[01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:28.940]  I mean, this is the way you make bioweapons.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:29.901]  The most deadly type.
[01:13:29.901 --> 01:13:39.808]  Because naturally occurring viruses and bacteria may kill small amounts of people, but immunity is developed quickly.
[01:13:39.808 --> 01:13:42.170]  And it doesn't normally attack large numbers.
[01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:45.272]  It's always something alien and radically new that's so deadly.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.861]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:13:48.861 --> 01:13:53.665]  And then they'll laugh at me on that and I'll say, look, let's just do something simple.
[01:13:53.665 --> 01:13:56.047]  Let's just do something simple here together.
[01:13:56.047 --> 01:13:57.949]  Turn your computer on.
[01:13:57.949 --> 01:14:01.011]  Or do you mind if I use that laptop over there?
[01:14:01.011 --> 01:14:15.624]  And we fire up the laptop and I say, Google or search engine, use whatever search engine you like, manufacturing process.
[01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:23.116]  Aspartame, or manufacturing process, or how to manufacture aspartame.
[01:14:23.116 --> 01:14:42.260]  And you'll be on university websites, and they'll, they have nice technical terms for it, but they take a genetically engineered E. coli bacteria, a bacteria that normally lives in sewage, they genetically engineer it to eat different forms of toxic waste,
[01:14:44.155 --> 01:15:00.999]  It's like they have oil-eating bacteria, similar to that, for oil spills, and then it defecates aspartame, or the base product of it, and then they ferment the dead bacteria and their feces, and then that's your aspartame.
[01:15:00.999 --> 01:15:02.920]  And they always laugh, and I say, bet me $10,000.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:07.601]  And then a lot of times, they see that I'm confident
[01:15:08.919 --> 01:15:14.021]  Because see, with the ignorant yuppies, everything is only about the illusion of confidence.
[01:15:14.021 --> 01:15:17.603]  So if you're actually confident with the truth, they may actually look.
[01:15:17.603 --> 01:15:21.884]  And then they go in and see the information and they freak out.
[01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:26.826]  Because then they read that it was developed in 1966 as a bio-weapon.
[01:15:26.826 --> 01:15:37.651]  They were doing bio-weapons research, the Army developed it, and then farmed it out to Searle, and the guy that at that time, in the 70s, was the head of the Defense Department, Donald Rumsfeld.
[01:15:38.584 --> 01:15:49.513]  He came back in 2001 to be defense sec, or sec death.
[01:15:49.513 --> 01:15:53.116]  It's a chemical weapon derived from a bioweapon experiment.
[01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:55.718]  Okay, now look, he just gets weirder from there.
[01:15:55.718 --> 01:16:01.743]  I could go on for hour after hour the insanity of what we're living under, what we're in the middle of.
[01:16:01.743 --> 01:16:04.966]  Mad scientist going wild.
[01:16:04.966 --> 01:16:06.707]  You're equal.
[01:16:06.707 --> 01:16:07.008]  You're
[01:16:08.083 --> 01:16:12.104]  You know, Aspartame, brand name, Equal.
[01:16:12.104 --> 01:16:13.884]  NutraSweet.
[01:16:13.884 --> 01:16:14.805]  It's very nutritious.
[01:16:14.805 --> 01:16:17.906]  You like bacteria crap?
[01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:20.866]  And the rabbit hole just gets deeper and deeper from there.
[01:16:20.866 --> 01:16:22.747]  Folks, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:16:22.747 --> 01:16:25.367]  I want to get that across to everybody.
[01:16:25.367 --> 01:16:27.808]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[01:16:27.808 --> 01:16:30.429]  I wish we were in Kansas.
[01:16:30.429 --> 01:16:33.149]  I wish we were in Kansas, Dorothy, don't you?
[01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:33.930]  It'd be a lot easier.
[01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:35.070]  I got a lot of other stuff I want to do.
[01:16:37.731 --> 01:16:40.553]  Daniel in New York, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:16:40.553 --> 01:16:43.674]  Yes, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:16:43.674 --> 01:16:51.699]  I've been listening a long time, and I've studied pretty much everything you've had to say, and I say you're rock solid.
[01:16:51.699 --> 01:16:55.821]  We're doing a campaign for LibertyNewYork.com in Rochester.
[01:16:55.821 --> 01:16:56.962]  We're organizing
[01:16:57.532 --> 01:17:01.053]  A freedom festival for all the patriots in western New York?
[01:17:12.873 --> 01:17:21.399]  So everybody should just go to meet-ups and look for their Campaign for Liberty events in their area and just go to them or start your own group or start your own liberty groups or freedom groups.
[01:17:21.399 --> 01:17:23.561]  And I think that's really wonderful and great.
[01:17:23.561 --> 01:17:28.204]  But if I allow you to do this right now, my friend, it is going to descend into nothing but plugs.
[01:17:28.204 --> 01:17:33.168]  Do you have a comment on Obama, a comment on the flu they're hyping, or NLE09?
[01:17:33.168 --> 01:17:34.268]  Well, absolutely.
[01:17:34.268 --> 01:17:36.650]  I definitely have a comment on the flu.
[01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:41.834]  And this thing you're talking about, this practice run that they're having?
[01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:51.834]  I live on Scottsdale Road, right up the street from the Rochester Airport, and all day I've seen nothing but these Humvees running up and down my street.
[01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:53.774]  It's unbelievable.
[01:17:53.774 --> 01:17:55.295]  And I just, it concerns me.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:59.023]  And there's like, what are we supposed to do about this?
[01:18:18.323 --> 01:18:28.836]  And yes, NLE09 is troops, drills, emergency threat integration centers, foreign troops, Israelis, French, Dutch, Australian, marching around.
[01:18:28.836 --> 01:18:30.078]  It's really happening!
[01:18:30.078 --> 01:18:33.442]  And they admit on FEMA's own website that NLE09
[01:18:36.067 --> 01:18:36.848]  I also have a question.
[01:18:36.848 --> 01:18:37.889]  I heard that they were going to
[01:18:52.611 --> 01:18:56.435]  Vote on some national gun bill this week.
[01:18:56.435 --> 01:18:58.797]  I wonder if you had heard anything about that.
[01:18:58.797 --> 01:19:01.440]  Yes, they got, no, it's a whole bunch of gun bills.
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:11.430]  And last week they shot down a pro-Second Amendment bill on, you know, states having reciprocity on concealed carries.
[01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:14.092]  But yes, they have got a bunch of horrid bills.
[01:19:14.092 --> 01:19:16.034]  One where no buy, no fly.
[01:19:17.454 --> 01:19:21.756]  Uh, no fly, no buy, where the Attorney General can just ban anybody he wants owning guns.
[01:19:21.756 --> 01:19:22.937]  No judge, no jury.
[01:19:22.937 --> 01:19:29.680]  Another bill's racing through the House to allow him to just ban any guns he wants, just like the banking bill gives the banks unlimited power.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.281]  See, they're just, this is, this is martial law.
[01:19:32.281 --> 01:19:33.962]  This is the takeover happening.
[01:19:33.962 --> 01:19:38.144]  Now, real fast, fire out, uh, the Campaign for Liberty event.
[01:19:38.144 --> 01:19:40.865]  It's CampaignForLibertyNewYork.com.
[01:19:40.865 --> 01:19:46.108]  It's September 11th at the German House, and we're also supporting local incumbent for
[01:19:46.841 --> 01:19:49.406]  Uh, Brockport, his name is Tim Bates.
[01:19:49.406 --> 01:19:57.661]  So come on out and... Good job, everybody can... yeah, just the way to do it is, we're in New York, check your meat up, get involved.
[01:19:57.661 --> 01:19:58.463]  That's the way you do it.
[01:19:58.463 --> 01:19:59.084]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:02.739 --> 01:20:04.240]  Recognize that sound?
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:09.045]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[01:20:09.045 --> 01:20:11.487]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[01:20:11.487 --> 01:20:16.811]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[01:20:16.811 --> 01:20:22.216]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[01:20:22.216 --> 01:20:25.659]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[01:20:25.659 --> 01:20:27.761]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[01:20:28.081 --> 01:20:35.686]  Introducing Choose for Health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 superfruits, sea vegetables and antioxidants.
[01:20:35.686 --> 01:20:38.528]  Stop paying for nutrients your body doesn't use.

[01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:01.803]  Gold.
[01:21:01.803 --> 01:21:03.344]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:03.344 --> 01:21:09.607]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:09.607 --> 01:21:13.790]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:15.731]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:15.731 --> 01:21:18.172]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:18.172 --> 01:21:25.236]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:21:25.316 --> 01:21:26.177]  We're good to go.
[01:21:54.514 --> 01:21:55.855]  You must read this report.
[01:21:55.855 --> 01:21:58.037]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:58.037 --> 01:22:07.184]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.184 --> 01:22:13.069]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.069 --> 01:22:19.234]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.494 --> 01:22:21.515]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.515 --> 01:22:23.996]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:22:23.996 --> 01:22:37.181]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.181 --> 01:22:38.842]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.842 --> 01:22:40.702]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.702 --> 01:22:46.945]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:22:55.875 --> 01:22:57.457]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.457 --> 01:22:58.659]  The people strike back!
[01:23:00.376 --> 01:23:03.757]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:23:03.757 --> 01:23:07.658]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:23:07.658 --> 01:23:11.379]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:23:11.379 --> 01:23:19.121]  At less than $0.02 per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[01:23:19.121 --> 01:23:19.341]  I think so.

[01:23:52.047 --> 01:23:52.928]  Or, call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:23:52.928 --> 01:23:53.528]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[01:24:13.058 --> 01:24:25.923]  Yeah, we had a caller in the last hour for stations that joined us earlier saying he heard me talking about foreign troops in southern Arizona doing takeover drills.
[01:24:25.923 --> 01:24:27.984]  I was in another drill.
[01:24:27.984 --> 01:24:29.804]  It was in the Phoenix newspaper.
[01:24:29.804 --> 01:24:32.025]  It was in the Tucson paper.
[01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:34.606]  It was in FEMA's own press release.
[01:24:34.606 --> 01:24:39.328]  But the listener didn't believe me until he was at a shooting range and saw, you know, a foreign troop from Israel.
[01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:48.356]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't just foreign troops training over here like the Germans in New Mexico on bombing runs.
[01:24:48.356 --> 01:24:52.339]  This is for the United States.
[01:24:52.339 --> 01:24:54.500]  They admit it.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:57.102]  So I'll talk more about that coming up.
[01:24:57.102 --> 01:24:58.883]  Also, this story out of Philly.
[01:24:58.883 --> 01:24:59.864]  Associated Press.
[01:24:59.864 --> 01:25:05.168]  Lethal warriors bringing combat hostility home.
[01:25:05.168 --> 01:25:09.070]  Most of the bank robberies now are whacked out troops.
[01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:09.611]  Folks, they've been
[01:25:10.902 --> 01:25:11.923]  Running checkpoints.
[01:25:11.923 --> 01:25:16.606]  They've been searching 10, 20, 30, 40, 100 homes a day.
[01:25:16.606 --> 01:25:18.807]  They've been killing people.
[01:25:18.807 --> 01:25:24.952]  And in World War II, it screwed up a lot of men who only had to serve one tour, 11 months.
[01:25:24.952 --> 01:25:30.095]  In Vietnam, it screwed up a lot of the men.
[01:25:30.095 --> 01:25:37.120]  And, you know, a lot of the macho people after World War II in Korea and Vietnam, you know, guys that would kill you over looking at them wrong,
[01:25:38.621 --> 01:25:39.542]  That's what happens.
[01:25:39.542 --> 01:25:40.082]  Well, guess what?
[01:25:40.082 --> 01:25:42.424]  They come back and they're cops.
[01:25:42.424 --> 01:25:44.926]  And then they go crazy on the citizens.
[01:25:44.926 --> 01:25:48.589]  But they also are running around robbing banks and killing their families.
[01:25:48.589 --> 01:26:00.057]  I got a stack of news here because they made them serve three, four, five tours in hardcore guerrilla combat, which is the worst type to make people go crazy.
[01:26:00.057 --> 01:26:01.919]  We all know old vets, folks.
[01:26:04.594 --> 01:26:09.776]  That somebody says something wrong to him at a barbecue and they stab the neighbor in the throat and kill him?
[01:26:09.776 --> 01:26:11.277]  I mean, don't we all know those people?
[01:26:11.277 --> 01:26:12.898]  Well, now they're all around us.
[01:26:12.898 --> 01:26:14.419]  And they didn't serve one to our folks.
[01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:16.179]  They served three or four or five.
[01:26:16.179 --> 01:26:18.520]  And they are out of their minds.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.521]  They are completely brain fried.
[01:26:20.521 --> 01:26:28.085]  There's that rare individual, because of their morals and family upbringing, genetics, whatever, that doesn't melt down and turn into a nut.
[01:26:28.085 --> 01:26:31.646]  But most people can't handle this stuff.
[01:26:31.646 --> 01:26:32.827]  Or they can't ever get out of it.
[01:26:37.048 --> 01:26:39.329]  It's more than post-traumatic stress disorder.
[01:26:39.329 --> 01:26:45.471]  That's what the psychologists call it.
[01:26:45.471 --> 01:26:47.251]  And the globalists grow these people.
[01:26:47.251 --> 01:26:48.292]  That's why they want wars.
[01:26:48.292 --> 01:26:55.274]  They need to create crops of these people to bring them back and make them be our rulers, the enforcers.
[01:26:55.274 --> 01:26:56.234]  Let's go to your calls here.
[01:26:56.234 --> 01:26:58.095]  I'll keep taking calls in the next segment.
[01:26:58.095 --> 01:27:03.456]  Let's talk to Brian in Montreal.
[01:27:03.456 --> 01:27:04.577]  Hi, how's it going?
[01:27:04.577 --> 01:27:04.797]  Good.
[01:27:06.102 --> 01:27:14.526]  I was just calling to let you know Alex that on Friday the Canadian Government Health Canada approved Tamiflu for babies.
[01:27:14.526 --> 01:27:20.549]  So they're completely ignoring all of the side effects and they're completely ignoring all of the cases that are being reported of
[01:27:21.610 --> 01:27:23.911]  Strain resistance to Tamiflu.
[01:27:23.911 --> 01:27:27.273]  Well, they admit that it doesn't protect against the flu.
[01:27:27.273 --> 01:27:29.454]  Japan five years ago banned it.
[01:27:29.454 --> 01:27:31.154]  It made people commit suicide.
[01:27:31.154 --> 01:27:32.935]  It made people die.
[01:27:32.935 --> 01:27:36.077]  It makes people have delusions.
[01:27:36.077 --> 01:27:37.938]  And they just don't care.
[01:27:37.938 --> 01:27:45.101]  This is from the same organization that has changed fluoride from a toxic contaminant to a health product.
[01:27:45.101 --> 01:27:47.422]  So it's not a big surprise up here in the Nazi North.
[01:27:49.091 --> 01:27:54.694]  Yeah, Canada really is one of the biggest police states in the world, and the people are some of the most asleep in the world.
[01:27:54.694 --> 01:27:56.115]  Very nice people.
[01:27:56.115 --> 01:28:02.438]  Canadians are smart, nice people, but they're under a spell.
[01:28:02.438 --> 01:28:10.103]  And maybe I would too, up in all those beautiful pine trees and blue skies, but it really is sick.
[01:28:10.103 --> 01:28:18.227]  I'd also like to let you know that about a month ago it was brought to my attention that the 1918 sample that they took was from an Inuit woman.
[01:28:18.934 --> 01:28:28.761]  And right away, because I've taken biology to math in my head, I thought to myself, they're doing this because every other Native North American Indian descends from the Inuits.
[01:28:28.761 --> 01:28:33.665]  So I had this fear about a month ago that it would start hitting the Indians more.
[01:28:33.665 --> 01:28:42.091]  And now here we are a month later, and they are reporting across Canada that all the Indian reservations are in a state of emergency.
[01:28:42.091 --> 01:28:46.334]  Yeah, well the feds also do that, and then they sterilize them and inject them.
[01:28:47.483 --> 01:28:49.044]  By locking it down.
[01:28:49.044 --> 01:28:52.205]  But yes, it's in Army manuals.
[01:28:52.205 --> 01:28:56.367]  Copied from the British manuals about how to give them the smallpox blankets.
[01:28:56.367 --> 01:29:07.151]  How, you know, when your troops have freshly had the sores, even squeeze a few, you know, wipe some of the sores off on the blankets and then immediately give them to the Indians.
[01:29:07.151 --> 01:29:08.932]  And then you'll be able to move into their property a month later.
[01:29:09.827 --> 01:29:13.328]  Montreal, I came to find out from a man that I talked to this weekend.
[01:29:13.328 --> 01:29:19.911]  He's a Frenchman, but he ends up working with the Indians, and he was working at a cigarette shop, and he got a phone call from the Canadian government.
[01:29:19.911 --> 01:29:24.752]  They wanted volunteers to come in for a trial vaccination for 75 bucks.
[01:29:24.752 --> 01:29:29.074]  So he comes in, and when he walks into the office, there's only five other people there.
[01:29:29.074 --> 01:29:33.796]  They're all Indian women, so they obviously thought he was going to be an Indian too.
[01:29:33.796 --> 01:29:35.536]  They were honest and said what they were doing.
[01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:37.337]  They were testing an influenza vaccine.
[01:29:38.086 --> 01:29:43.947]  He didn't like it, but he took the paperwork and he shoved it up his sleeve and he walked out for proof that this is going on.
[01:29:43.947 --> 01:29:46.048]  Because the Canadian government's doing this in secret.
[01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:47.908]  Just trust them.
[01:29:47.908 --> 01:29:51.229]  Take the injection.
[01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:52.630]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.630 --> 01:29:55.150]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.150 --> 01:29:57.831]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.472 --> 01:30:01.854]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:30:01.854 --> 01:30:03.856]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:30:03.856 --> 01:30:04.837]  Well, you should.
[01:30:04.837 --> 01:30:09.322]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:30:09.322 --> 01:30:10.123]  That's right.
[01:30:10.123 --> 01:30:18.793]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:30:18.793 --> 01:30:20.154]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:30:20.154 --> 01:30:21.296]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:30:21.496 --> 01:30:27.479]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:30:27.479 --> 01:30:34.382]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:30:34.382 --> 01:30:39.564]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:30:39.884 --> 01:30:41.345]  This is real.
[01:30:41.345 --> 01:30:42.406]  Don't miss out.
[01:30:42.406 --> 01:30:50.971]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[01:30:50.971 --> 01:30:53.332]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[01:30:53.332 --> 01:30:57.034]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:30:57.034 --> 01:30:59.936]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[01:31:00.831 --> 01:31:02.492]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:02.492 --> 01:31:07.233]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:31:07.233 --> 01:31:10.215]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:13.236]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:31:13.236 --> 01:31:19.098]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:31:19.318 --> 01:31:22.563]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:31:22.563 --> 01:31:29.573]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:31:29.573 --> 01:31:32.837]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:31:32.837 --> 01:31:33.098]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:35.521 --> 01:31:37.982]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:31:37.982 --> 01:31:44.244]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:31:44.244 --> 01:31:48.005]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:48.005 --> 01:31:49.365]  Again, 1-800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:31:49.365 --> 01:31:49.985]  Take action today.
[01:31:49.985 --> 01:31:51.806]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:32:00.796 --> 01:32:06.664]  Surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[01:32:06.664 --> 01:32:08.446]  Take a deep breath.
[01:32:08.446 --> 01:32:14.695]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[01:32:18.183 --> 01:32:18.903]  I don't think so.
[01:32:48.112 --> 01:32:49.133]  We're gonna go live!
[01:33:18.807 --> 01:33:36.382]  I will explain next hour why I haven't spent a lot of time on it.
[01:33:36.382 --> 01:33:38.824]  I've spent some.
[01:33:38.824 --> 01:33:42.587]  But that why now I am going to start getting into it.
[01:33:42.587 --> 01:33:45.269]  Because a lot of times I don't have something figured out at first.
[01:33:45.269 --> 01:33:47.431]  It takes me time to study it, look at it,
[01:33:48.914 --> 01:33:51.995]  And to observe the enemy.
[01:33:51.995 --> 01:33:58.297]  Observe their activities, observe their psychology, observe their behavior until I start to get a clear picture.
[01:33:58.297 --> 01:34:02.358]  I will say now, I believe he was born in Kenya.
[01:34:02.358 --> 01:34:08.100]  I believe it's legitimate from their actions.
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:16.803]  The biggest point is that they keep lying in the mainstream news saying they've released the birth certificate.
[01:34:19.218 --> 01:34:28.143]  And saying it's ridiculous, it's crazy, we've released the birth certificate, why are these nuts doing this?
[01:34:28.143 --> 01:34:38.329]  And all that does is add fuel to the fire because everybody who's investigated knows they haven't released the birth certificate and other presidents have, when asked.
[01:34:38.329 --> 01:34:47.474]  That they've released a receipt of the birth certificate and it appears to be fake compared to other Hawaiian certificates of birth certificate.
[01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:53.971]  A receipt of birth certificate.
[01:34:53.971 --> 01:34:57.091]  A receipt of birth.
[01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:59.832]  And then you add about a hundred other points and it looks bad.
[01:34:59.832 --> 01:35:01.813]  And now they're getting scared.
[01:35:01.813 --> 01:35:07.934]  I watched a lot of television this weekend when I was running on the treadmill.
[01:35:07.934 --> 01:35:10.955]  I'm trying to up it to running on the weekends about two hours a day.
[01:35:10.955 --> 01:35:12.775]  Hey, it's worked.
[01:35:12.775 --> 01:35:14.356]  I've lost 35 pounds now.
[01:35:14.356 --> 01:35:16.596]  I'll lose another 35.
[01:35:16.596 --> 01:35:19.297]  I'll get skinny.
[01:35:19.297 --> 01:35:20.437]  But side issue.
[01:35:23.601 --> 01:35:30.006]  I watched television while I'm on the treadmill out there in the 105-degree garage.
[01:35:30.006 --> 01:35:33.228]  That'll get the blubber to melt off of you.
[01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:36.390]  But doesn't matter.
[01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:37.331]  I'm covering it next hour.
[01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:40.493]  I'm going to cover all the details next hour instead of stopping and starting right now.
[01:35:40.493 --> 01:35:45.977]  I want to jam in John, Sherry, Phil, and John, and a few others.
[01:35:45.977 --> 01:35:46.157]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:46.297]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:46.297 --> 01:35:47.978]  I do want to plug a couple things here before.
[01:35:54.963 --> 01:35:56.744]  I go back to your calls.
[01:35:56.744 --> 01:36:01.828]  I got a call from Ted Anderson this morning.
[01:36:01.828 --> 01:36:08.293]  He's on vacation with his wife, riding Harleys in the Black Hills.
[01:36:08.293 --> 01:36:09.354]  Man, do I envy that.
[01:36:09.354 --> 01:36:19.642]  And he called me saying, I'm up here on a mountaintop, only place I can get cell, and I'm gonna let you do that offer you did last week again.
[01:36:19.642 --> 01:36:21.144]  And I said, excuse me?
[01:36:23.294 --> 01:36:27.797]  And he said, yeah, we've got a little bit left and I don't care.
[01:36:27.797 --> 01:36:29.738]  I just want to blast all the competition.
[01:36:29.738 --> 01:36:32.020]  I want to be the best deal out there.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:38.304]  Because, you know, in the past when we have these deals and I tell you this is the end, this is the end of it, it is the end.
[01:36:38.304 --> 01:36:43.768]  And last week he sold out of the silver coins at the lower price when silver had been a dollar and a half lower.
[01:36:46.224 --> 01:36:49.985]  And he's almost sold out of the British Sovereigns and the Franks.
[01:36:49.985 --> 01:36:56.166]  These are coins that he bought at the 905 to 913 level a couple months ago.
[01:36:56.166 --> 01:36:57.706]  In a big, huge buy he made.
[01:36:57.706 --> 01:36:59.867]  They are almost all gone.
[01:36:59.867 --> 01:37:01.407]  He believes they'll sell out today.
[01:37:01.407 --> 01:37:05.748]  Even if they do, he will just sell you other coins he bought for more at the same price.
[01:37:05.748 --> 01:37:10.309]  So these are factored in to a market between 905 an ounce and 913 an ounce.
[01:37:13.291 --> 01:37:15.332]  He bought different groups at different prices.
[01:37:15.332 --> 01:37:20.775]  When gold is at $9.55 today.
[01:37:20.775 --> 01:37:26.918]  So we're talking right at $50 above that.
[01:37:26.918 --> 01:37:30.300]  Between $48 and $50 plus.
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:33.382]  Above that right now.
[01:37:33.382 --> 01:37:39.945]  So this is a super deal and the brokers are there right now and I challenge you to find a better deal.
[01:37:39.945 --> 01:37:42.727]  This is where I've chosen to get gold coins in the past when I have the capital.
[01:37:44.284 --> 01:37:46.545]  As emergency backup funds.
[01:37:46.545 --> 01:37:58.070]  British Sovereign Gold Coins at bullion prices from months ago, when it's way up now, and it even has numismatic collector value.
[01:37:58.070 --> 01:38:05.694]  So it's a win-win-win-win-win for $266 per coin.
[01:38:05.694 --> 01:38:07.295]  $266 British Sovereign Gold Coins.
[01:38:07.295 --> 01:38:08.355]  Great deal.
[01:38:08.355 --> 01:38:10.656]  Franks, this is the best, at $216.
[01:38:10.656 --> 01:38:10.896]  Franks at $216.
[01:38:15.353 --> 01:38:19.935]  Now, I've never seen Ted offer a deal this good this long.
[01:38:19.935 --> 01:38:20.976]  These deals do end.
[01:38:20.976 --> 01:38:22.137]  I'm surprised it's not over.
[01:38:22.137 --> 01:38:23.137]  He said it was over last week.
[01:38:23.137 --> 01:38:25.038]  He said, no, I've got a little bit left.
[01:38:25.038 --> 01:38:28.540]  Frank's at 216.
[01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:35.444]  And he's out of the silver dollars at the price from two months ago, when gold and silver took a dip.
[01:38:35.444 --> 01:38:39.166]  But he's not out of walking liberty half dollars from World War II.
[01:38:39.166 --> 01:38:40.286]  Gorgeous coins.
[01:38:40.286 --> 01:38:41.247]  I've owned a bag of these.
[01:38:42.719 --> 01:38:44.981]  Eight sixty nine a piece, another great deal.
[01:38:44.981 --> 01:38:46.522]  He does have also a great deal on Lakota.
[01:38:46.522 --> 01:38:48.183]  Just ask about that when you call.
[01:38:48.183 --> 01:38:55.229]  They have the Lakota silver round at nineteen seventy four.
[01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:57.131]  Silver is way up above this now.
[01:38:58.533 --> 01:39:07.535]  Bottom line, it's a very, very good deal, and they will sell out of these Walking Liberty half dollars at that price very, very quickly, like they did the Lakotas.
[01:39:07.535 --> 01:39:09.916]  Those have gone up a bit, but they have those, still a great price.
[01:39:09.916 --> 01:39:12.956]  The Franks at $216, British Sovereigns $266.
[01:39:12.956 --> 01:39:22.178]  The brokers, all 34 of them, are sitting there right now at Midas Resources in Minneapolis, Minnesota, right now, to take your order.
[01:39:22.178 --> 01:39:25.519]  They have the gold, they will ship it out to you, the silver.
[01:39:26.843 --> 01:39:29.564]  A lot of places are still sold out or have huge premiums.
[01:39:29.564 --> 01:39:32.366]  They have it on hand, ready to ship.
[01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:33.947]  800-686-2237.
[01:39:33.947 --> 01:39:34.007]  800-686-2237.
[01:39:34.007 --> 01:39:34.127]  800-686-2237.
[01:39:34.127 --> 01:39:35.087]  Protect yourself today.
[01:39:35.087 --> 01:39:38.129]  Start getting out of the paper and out of the stocks and bonds and out of the
[01:39:51.818 --> 01:39:53.979]  Fiat Federal Reserve notes.
[01:39:53.979 --> 01:39:55.600]  Get into gold and silver, this is a great deal.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:55.660]  800-686-2237.
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:56.081]  800-686-2237.
[01:39:56.081 --> 01:39:58.822]  They'll be there till midnight tonight, and they'll hold this deal through midnight.
[01:39:58.822 --> 01:39:58.902]  800-686-2237.
[01:39:58.902 --> 01:40:01.103]  Now, lastly, one of the sponsors,
[01:40:21.069 --> 01:40:26.287]  that has made today's show possible is efoodsdirect.com

[01:41:23.899 --> 01:41:25.520]  Okay, I'm going to try to not pontificate.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:33.027]  Let's take five, six calls and get back into the big news on NLE09, the flu situation, Obama's approval rating plunging.
[01:41:33.027 --> 01:41:34.188]  It's all coming up.
[01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:35.830]  John in Vermont, thanks for holding.
[01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:36.871]  Welcome.
[01:41:36.871 --> 01:41:39.673]  Good, perfect, perfect introduction.
[01:41:39.673 --> 01:41:42.235]  You had a guest on last week.
[01:41:42.235 --> 01:41:47.060]  Not for me, I mean, perfect introduction about Obama's flu campaign and all that.
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:49.422]  Last week, on Thursday, what was his name?
[01:41:49.422 --> 01:41:50.343]  Was it George Soros?
[01:41:50.343 --> 01:41:50.423]  No.
[01:41:51.459 --> 01:41:55.262]  Do you remember last Thursday who was the guest?
[01:41:55.262 --> 01:41:56.963]  George, I mean, I have a lot of guests on.
[01:41:56.963 --> 01:41:58.804]  I don't remember who was on last Thursday.
[01:41:58.804 --> 01:42:00.366]  Anyway, I can't remember either.
[01:42:00.366 --> 01:42:01.686]  Hold on just a minute.
[01:42:01.686 --> 01:42:02.607]  We can look that up.
[01:42:02.607 --> 01:42:06.910]  Last Thursday, it all runs together.
[01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:08.932]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:42:12.239 --> 01:42:15.361]  You asked him, you said, so, do you think this is the big one?
[01:42:15.361 --> 01:42:20.064]  The flu, the flu coming back, this swine, so-called swine flu coming back this fall.
[01:42:20.064 --> 01:42:24.107]  You predicted it would come back in the fall this past spring, I remember.
[01:42:24.107 --> 01:42:26.969]  Six times twice, you know, strengthened.
[01:42:26.969 --> 01:42:28.550]  You said, do you think this is the big one?
[01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:39.218]  And he answered, I doubt it, but I do think that it could be his ticket to initiate another
[01:42:46.766 --> 01:42:51.709]  Well, that's exactly what I've been saying, and I appreciate your call.
[01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:53.890]  You've got a bad Skype phone or IP phone.
[01:42:53.890 --> 01:42:57.292]  I'm going to let you go, but good points.
[01:42:57.292 --> 01:43:03.935]  I didn't just say that they would bring it back in the fall and fearmonger back in April when all this was going on.
[01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:08.781]  Understand folks, I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:43:08.781 --> 01:43:11.982]  We need to point out that we know what we're talking about here.
[01:43:11.982 --> 01:43:15.504]  This is valuable information to all of us in our future.
[01:43:15.504 --> 01:43:21.686]  And my life depends on waking all of you up and you waking others up.
[01:43:21.686 --> 01:43:26.208]  I mean, I passed the point of no return a long time ago, ladies and gentlemen, fighting these people.
[01:43:26.208 --> 01:43:27.569]  I gotta stay in the public eye.
[01:43:27.569 --> 01:43:28.809]  I gotta get bigger.
[01:43:28.809 --> 01:43:30.390]  I gotta reach more people.
[01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:32.991]  We've gotta take the fight to the enemy.
[01:43:32.991 --> 01:43:34.031]  There's no going back.
[01:43:34.031 --> 01:43:35.372]  And there's no going back for you either.
[01:43:37.165 --> 01:43:41.930]  History shows that, but side point.
[01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:45.594]  Very heavy question the caller brings up.
[01:43:45.594 --> 01:43:58.087]  On March 3rd and March 4th and March 5th and March 6th, on a whole line of shows, and people have gone and pulled the clips out and put it up on YouTube, I laid out exactly what was going to happen.
[01:43:58.087 --> 01:43:59.268]  Because of the chatter.
[01:44:00.509 --> 01:44:11.494]  We had FBI sources, federal marshal sources, city manager sources, county emergency manager sources, newspaper sources, all of my sources.
[01:44:13.763 --> 01:44:19.466]  Said they're probably gonna pull some flu scam and they're telling us get ready for martial law and mass graves.
[01:44:19.466 --> 01:44:38.796]  Then I started getting the secret mass grave documents out of New York and out of Indiana and out of Illinois and I posted them and got laughed at even though it had the stinking phone numbers, official letterhead, and then later it all came out now, Associated Press yesterday, it's true, it's real, they're getting ready for mass graves and incinerators.
[01:44:44.122 --> 01:44:50.746]  So, and then I have these weird COINTELPRO people email me and call me and go, tell us who your FBI source is!
[01:44:50.746 --> 01:44:53.127]  Tell us who your Pentagon source is!
[01:44:53.127 --> 01:44:58.210]  Tell us who your federal marshal sources are!
[01:44:58.210 --> 01:44:59.310]  Yeah, so they can get in trouble.
[01:44:59.310 --> 01:45:01.492]  That's a real good idea.
[01:45:01.492 --> 01:45:09.116]  Just like when we broke the clergy response teams, how they were secretly hiring all these preachers under FEMA payroll to get them ready for martial law.
[01:45:09.755 --> 01:45:13.136]  People are like, you tell us who gave you the documents.
[01:45:13.136 --> 01:45:19.778]  The stinking documents had the phone numbers and links and ended to FEMA.
[01:45:19.778 --> 01:45:22.678]  And then the preacher, one preacher that gave it to me said, oh, don't worry about it.
[01:45:22.678 --> 01:45:25.719]  I went up to a little corner place, not my office to fax it.
[01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:30.520]  I went to a place, you know, another town on the edge of the county.
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:36.502]  You don't have to black out the name of the store's fax machine at the top on all those documents.
[01:45:36.502 --> 01:45:37.262]  So I posted it.
[01:45:38.393 --> 01:45:50.660]  They sent the FBI and FEMA to the store, got his credit card record of him paying to fax it that day, and showed up at his office threatening him.
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:54.042]  You need to show us who the source is on that!
[01:45:54.042 --> 01:45:54.943]  You're lying!
[01:45:54.943 --> 01:45:59.185]  They're not secretly hiring preachers!
[01:45:59.185 --> 01:46:07.590]  Later, a year and a half later, came out mainstream news, word for word what I told you, training for martial law, how to go to the camps, how to take forced inoculations.
[01:46:08.968 --> 01:46:10.549]  But it wasn't word-for-word what I told you.
[01:46:10.549 --> 01:46:17.071]  It's word-for-word what the documents said.
[01:46:17.071 --> 01:46:19.532]  And over and over and over again.
[01:46:19.532 --> 01:46:26.955]  So, we've known for years they've been getting ready for martial law under the guise of smallpox or flu.
[01:46:26.955 --> 01:46:31.536]  We know they passed the Model Stateshold Emergency Powers Act to do it.
[01:46:31.536 --> 01:46:35.698]  And then we start getting all this chatter in January and February into March.
[01:46:37.264 --> 01:46:53.099]  To the point of, for the third time ever, I went on air, just like I did before 9-11 and in one other case, and I said, they're probably going to launch some type of flu pandemic, or at least hype one up, as the cover for Marshall Law.
[01:46:53.099 --> 01:46:57.824]  And I said that in March, over and over and over, and we wrote articles about it!
[01:46:57.824 --> 01:46:59.686]  Aaron Dykes wrote articles about it!
[01:47:03.635 --> 01:47:05.136]  And we got laughed at again.
[01:47:05.136 --> 01:47:21.126]  Then all of a sudden they start saying, end of America, lockdown, it could kill millions, could kill billions worldwide, and I said, folks, I don't know if this is a hoax or not, but this could be the big one, because these people are eugenicist murderers, and they've been gearing up for local government takeovers, so this could either be a hoax,
[01:47:21.946 --> 01:47:25.947]  To get you to take the shots as a smokescreen for federalization.
[01:47:25.947 --> 01:47:28.448]  Or, this could be a real pandemic.
[01:47:28.448 --> 01:47:33.769]  Then, days into that, in April, I get a secret State of Texas document with phone numbers and names.
[01:47:33.769 --> 01:47:34.550]  I call.
[01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:36.330]  They ask, where did you get this information?
[01:47:36.330 --> 01:47:37.451]  I confirm it's real.
[01:47:37.451 --> 01:47:39.951]  I go on air and say, we're at level 5 now.
[01:47:39.951 --> 01:47:42.092]  The media said we were at level 4.
[01:47:42.092 --> 01:47:44.312]  And we're going to level 6 in 96 hours.
[01:47:44.312 --> 01:47:45.313]  And then it happened.
[01:47:45.313 --> 01:47:49.254]  And you learned months later that that's what had happened exactly as I told you.
[01:47:49.734 --> 01:48:02.939]  I got real sources, ladies and gentlemen, and if that hasn't been proven yet, you notice the COINTELPRO comes out at me every time I break something, because they don't want to kill me, because that'll only make my information that much more powerful.
[01:48:02.939 --> 01:48:05.620]  They want to discredit me.
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:09.781]  Folks, when they try to discredit me, they try to discredit you.
[01:48:09.781 --> 01:48:11.842]  Do you understand that?
[01:48:11.842 --> 01:48:16.964]  We are taking heavy fire from government disinformation operatives, and it's only going to get worse.
[01:48:20.848 --> 01:48:28.713]  With all sorts of dirty tricks and stuff, but I am a big boy and I asked for it and I'm ready to take it.
[01:48:28.713 --> 01:48:35.077]  All I ask you to do is to defend me and continue to spread the word.
[01:48:35.077 --> 01:48:36.398]  And not even so much defend me.
[01:48:36.398 --> 01:48:38.119]  You know how you defend me?
[01:48:38.119 --> 01:48:39.720]  You defend yourself.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:40.841]  You don't defend me.
[01:48:42.429 --> 01:48:45.011]  You tell people not to take the vaccines.
[01:48:45.011 --> 01:48:46.212]  You expose why.
[01:48:46.212 --> 01:48:50.937]  You tell the troops and military and police not to go along with the New World Order staged terror.
[01:48:50.937 --> 01:48:59.504]  You stay on issue, and you expose and discredit the criminal system, and then we can make their system stall, then we can audit the Fed.
[01:48:59.504 --> 01:49:03.367]  If we don't win this time, we'll win the second or third or fourth try.
[01:49:03.367 --> 01:49:04.989]  You can see the momentum shifting.
[01:49:04.989 --> 01:49:08.512]  And we can discredit these criminals and start arresting them like Madoff.
[01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:12.078]  And other criminals, just like Richard Nixon or any of them.
[01:49:12.078 --> 01:49:13.759]  They are not invincible.
[01:49:13.759 --> 01:49:15.340]  So you have to have faith we can win.
[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:23.065]  You have to stay on point and get the information out.
[01:49:23.065 --> 01:49:26.527]  So you defend me by defending the Republic and the truth.
[01:49:26.527 --> 01:49:28.328]  So many people call and want to defend me.
[01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:31.130]  It's rabbit trails, it's rat holes, it's lies.
[01:49:32.438 --> 01:49:34.040]  The proof is in our work.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:36.122]  The proof is in what we've covered.
[01:49:36.122 --> 01:49:39.126]  The proof is in our history and our facts.
[01:49:39.126 --> 01:49:47.495]  And no amount of straw men or misrepresentations of who we are or what we are or our record are going to work!
[01:49:47.495 --> 01:49:52.121]  Just like all of Barack Obama's propaganda and lies aren't going to fix what he's doing.
[01:49:54.690 --> 01:49:59.333]  The truth in the end wins, evil in the end always fails.
[01:49:59.333 --> 01:50:09.880]  No matter how scientifically arranged it is, no matter how slickly the design has been woven, if you just say no and start spreading the word, speaking out, handing out copies of the Obama deception,
[01:50:11.345 --> 01:50:21.092]  And getting the word out, and bumper stickers, and calling in to talk radio shows, and starting websites, and getting access to TV shows, and buying radio time for your own show if you have to.
[01:50:21.092 --> 01:50:23.093]  I don't care if you're not the most articulate.
[01:50:23.093 --> 01:50:24.073]  It doesn't matter.
[01:50:24.073 --> 01:50:28.496]  What wins wars is taking action and getting in the fight.
[01:50:28.496 --> 01:50:30.898]  Like General Stubblebine said, mass.
[01:50:30.898 --> 01:50:32.439]  And we've got the mass.
[01:50:32.439 --> 01:50:33.920]  We've just got to activate the mass.
[01:50:34.844 --> 01:50:57.623]  Activate in your area as an Info Warrior, as a 1776 Patriot reborn, as a Special Forces Operator for Liberty and Truth, wielding the weapon of truth and start blasting in all directions, discrediting this enemy operation and exposing all their tricks and stage terror and stage crises and keep moving forward to positive fashion, never surrendering.
[01:50:57.623 --> 01:50:58.804]  We're gonna win!
[01:50:58.804 --> 01:50:59.965]  More calls coming up!
[01:51:01.414 --> 01:51:07.238]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:51:07.238 --> 01:51:14.824]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:51:14.824 --> 01:51:20.969]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:51:21.329 --> 01:51:23.370]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:51:23.370 --> 01:51:25.871]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:51:25.871 --> 01:51:37.435]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:51:37.435 --> 01:51:39.115]  It's not about left or right.
[01:51:39.115 --> 01:51:40.976]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:51:40.976 --> 01:51:47.198]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:51:47.876 --> 01:51:56.149]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:57.731]  The Obama Deception.
[01:51:57.731 --> 01:51:58.933]  The people strike back!
[01:52:00.677 --> 01:52:04.440]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:14.586]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[01:52:14.586 --> 01:52:21.891]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[01:52:21.891 --> 01:52:27.535]  Doctors who have tried heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results as well.
[01:52:27.535 --> 01:52:30.657]  Here's what Dr. Goodman has to say about his experience with the product.
[01:52:30.937 --> 01:52:36.539]  If you notice that most times, these drug ads on TV, they have a list of possible side effects.
[01:52:36.539 --> 01:52:43.481]  I find that if you're going to take something that is, you're trading one problem for five or six other problems, that to me doesn't make sense.
[01:52:43.481 --> 01:52:50.023]  Using something that is natural, that is absorbed into the body, particularly because it's in a liquid form, I think is the best way to go.
[01:53:00.766 --> 01:53:07.756]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes.com, the makers of the highest quality vault doors and safes available.

[01:54:12.099 --> 01:54:17.562]  Yeah, sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.
[01:54:40.265 --> 01:54:42.747]  Uh-huh, here's the key!
[01:54:42.747 --> 01:54:44.629]  You tell him!
[01:55:09.614 --> 01:55:27.529]  Let's talk to John in Idaho.
[01:55:27.529 --> 01:55:30.931]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:55:30.931 --> 01:55:32.152]  How you doing?
[01:55:32.152 --> 01:55:33.754]  Good, thanks for calling.
[01:55:33.754 --> 01:55:34.935]  Great job you're doing.
[01:55:34.935 --> 01:55:37.397]  And I got your back every time I can.
[01:55:37.397 --> 01:55:38.237]  God bless you, sir.
[01:55:38.237 --> 01:55:38.778]  What's on your mind?
[01:55:39.625 --> 01:55:43.245]  On the YouTube they started NLE09 Overwatch.
[01:55:44.625 --> 01:55:48.208]  It's to report pictures or any troop movements with videos or pictures.
[01:55:48.208 --> 01:55:54.873]  Yes, I saw that last night and I meant to give it to my guys and that's just like the thousands of pieces of data I see every few days.
[01:55:54.873 --> 01:56:01.298]  I forget most of them because you can look at stuff fast but then to track it down or... What's the YouTube channel?
[01:56:01.298 --> 01:56:10.385]  Because I saw some good info on that and we will get a full-time sector post on InfoWars or Prison Planet.
[01:56:11.235 --> 01:56:17.920]  Okay, his name was SimpleDan76, who started it.
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:20.561]  Well, there's a lot of different channels.
[01:56:20.561 --> 01:56:23.583]  I saw a different one that's doing that, but yeah, a lot of key stuff.
[01:56:23.583 --> 01:56:33.110]  In fact, guys, all you do is type in NLE09, and then do a search, and then do the newest search, and it'll all come up.
[01:56:33.752 --> 01:56:36.875]  Absolutely, and I've asked my web guys to be posting a lot of that.
[01:56:36.875 --> 01:56:40.958]  I want to create a whole section in the next week just on NLE09.
[01:56:40.958 --> 01:56:43.980]  I want to create a Battle Watch section on the flu.
[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:50.425]  We've got to start not just posting main articles, but have special sections that only go for a month or so during key events.
[01:56:50.425 --> 01:56:51.446]  Great idea!
[01:56:51.446 --> 01:56:52.847]  Anything else, John?
[01:56:52.847 --> 01:56:53.427]  No, that would be it.
[01:56:53.427 --> 01:56:54.248]  Thank you.
[01:56:54.248 --> 01:56:54.968]  God bless you, sir.
[01:56:54.968 --> 01:56:58.591]  Appreciate the call.
[01:56:58.591 --> 01:57:00.613]  Sherry and Tejas, you're on the air, Sherry.
[01:57:01.377 --> 01:57:23.181]  Hey Alex, I compiled a bunch of articles, like you just said, we shouldn't do, but I compiled a bunch of articles on squalene and other oil-based adjuvants that are going to be put in vaccines this fall, specifically GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis' vaccines.
[01:57:23.181 --> 01:57:29.342]  And I used to think that mercury was the biggest problem there was with these vaccines.
[01:57:29.898 --> 01:57:32.159]  But it turns out that it's not.
[01:57:32.159 --> 01:57:37.800]  It's the antigen sparing oil-based adjuvants that are the worst.
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:40.501]  Aluminum's bad enough.
[01:57:40.501 --> 01:57:43.042]  But this one is really bad.
[01:57:43.042 --> 01:57:44.582]  Yeah, it's a witch's brew.
[01:57:44.582 --> 01:57:49.863]  And they argue, well you can eat small amounts of squalene, yes, but it's not in your blood supply.
[01:57:49.863 --> 01:57:53.524]  It turns on the autoimmune response.
[01:57:53.524 --> 01:57:59.166]  And then whenever you get that autoimmune response, it's like a cytokine type reaction.
[01:57:59.819 --> 01:58:09.825]  Um, what happens is your body starts attacking all of the places in your body where it thinks that that oil is found.
[01:58:09.825 --> 01:58:11.406]  Yes.
[01:58:11.406 --> 01:58:14.028]  It causes an autoimmune response.
[01:58:14.028 --> 01:58:17.630]  For a layman, it's like getting poison ivy all over your organs.
[01:58:17.630 --> 01:58:22.653]  Yeah, like 10 million people already right now have autoimmune disorders in the United States.
[01:58:22.653 --> 01:58:24.654]  Hey, this is the thing killing the women!
[01:58:25.345 --> 01:58:26.606]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:10.409 --> 02:00:11.970]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.970 --> 02:00:12.890]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:17.713]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.713 --> 02:00:21.776]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.188 --> 02:00:28.670]  Okay, we are simulcasting the second half of the syndicated radio show.
[02:00:28.670 --> 02:00:31.212]  I'm here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:00:31.212 --> 02:00:32.292]  to 3 p.m.
[02:00:32.292 --> 02:00:33.393]  Central Standard Time.
[02:00:33.393 --> 02:00:35.014]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[02:00:35.014 --> 02:00:35.594]  weekdays.
[02:00:35.594 --> 02:00:38.936]  And we simulcast at least the last two hours.
[02:00:38.936 --> 02:00:40.717]  Some days we do the whole show.
[02:00:40.717 --> 02:00:43.018]  Simulcasting in living color.
[02:00:43.018 --> 02:00:48.201]  The radio show turns into a slash TV show at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:00:48.201 --> 02:00:52.103]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.TV supporters out there that are members.
[02:00:53.573 --> 02:00:56.715]  And all the listeners listening, of course, on the radio as well.
[02:00:56.715 --> 02:01:00.977]  We're going to take a few calls, finish up with Sherry and others.
[02:01:00.977 --> 02:01:02.958]  Phil Berg is coming up.
[02:01:02.958 --> 02:01:11.382]  I haven't in months covered the birther issue, his birth certificate, because I wanted to sit back and really study it first.
[02:01:11.382 --> 02:01:14.543]  And I've been studying it now for a year.
[02:01:14.543 --> 02:01:16.905]  And I can say that where there's smoke, there's fire.
[02:01:17.796 --> 02:01:24.985]  They're covering up, they're hiding something, and I can say that with pretty much certainty now, it looks like he probably was born in Kenya.
[02:01:26.543 --> 02:01:31.167]  And this is becoming a major issue and so now we're going to tackle it.
[02:01:31.167 --> 02:01:33.848]  And the new Obama film also gets into it some.
[02:01:33.848 --> 02:01:39.773]  I wanted to make a film just on all the other bad stuff he's doing because they always say no one will attack his real policies.
[02:01:39.773 --> 02:01:41.174]  That's totally made up.
[02:01:41.174 --> 02:01:45.177]  We do go over the policies and the deceit and the corruption.
[02:01:45.177 --> 02:01:47.218]  But Phil Barke's coming up.
[02:01:47.218 --> 02:01:48.139]  Sherry in Texas
[02:01:49.443 --> 02:02:01.388]  Was talking about the squalene and other chemicals they put in vaccines, not just the mercury or aluminum, that cause the autoimmune disease and that cause the body to attack itself.
[02:02:01.388 --> 02:02:06.671]  And how suddenly out of the blue, tens of millions of Americans are getting these autoimmune diseases.
[02:02:06.671 --> 02:02:14.114]  And I remember during the approval, during the trials of Gardasil, the human papillomavirus, live cancer virus vaccine,
[02:02:15.985 --> 02:02:19.587]  Why were they pushing this national vaccine for something that kills 3,000 people a year?
[02:02:19.587 --> 02:02:21.088]  That's not that many for cancer.
[02:02:21.088 --> 02:02:22.248]  Way down the list.
[02:02:22.248 --> 02:02:24.530]  Very easily treatable.
[02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:26.351]  The vaccine itself didn't protect.
[02:02:26.351 --> 02:02:29.192]  They admitted against most strains of the virus.
[02:02:29.192 --> 02:02:36.216]  So it made no sense until you realize that Merck's cold-blooded eugenicist, with all the other stuff they do.
[02:02:36.216 --> 02:02:44.821]  And then these women were taking it and they were bleeding out of all their orifices and getting these red rashes and having an autoimmune disease where the body just attacks itself.
[02:02:45.768 --> 02:02:49.890]  And then after your body kind of burns out, then you don't have any immune system left.
[02:02:49.890 --> 02:02:55.994]  First it goes crazy, then you... And they're in wheelchairs, and they're dying, and... I keep talking about this.
[02:02:55.994 --> 02:02:58.595]  You know, Google for folks right now on screen, guys.
[02:02:58.595 --> 02:03:03.738]  Gardasil deaths, or Gardasil autoimmune... I mean, they know it does this.
[02:03:03.738 --> 02:03:07.360]  But the drug company got government immunity.
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:10.182]  And so this lady Sherry was bringing up, for people that just joined us,
[02:03:11.269 --> 02:03:18.913]  She's been doing her own research off we talked about with what these immune activators like squalene and others do.
[02:03:18.913 --> 02:03:21.194]  Tell folks more about it in closing.
[02:03:21.194 --> 02:03:35.082]  Well, basically they're antigen sparing, which means that they claim that this is wonderful because we get to reduce the amount of vaccine that we need for the dose, but what
[02:03:37.284 --> 02:03:40.965]  What they really mean by antigen sparing is they're putting an adjuvant in there.
[02:03:40.965 --> 02:03:47.987]  Yeah, it turns your immune system way up so it recognizes the tiny amount of cancer virus they put in you.
[02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:48.607]  Exactly.
[02:03:48.607 --> 02:03:58.490]  They say a more robust response and words like that.
[02:03:58.490 --> 02:04:04.692]  That's kind of creepy, but they like to make things that are horrible sound good.
[02:04:05.479 --> 02:04:22.944]  Um, they say, like, their strategic goal is to expand the supply of pre-pandemic and pandemic influenza vaccines, but their specific aim is to, you know, determine whether the antigens can be used safely and effectively with adjuvants.
[02:04:22.944 --> 02:04:27.345]  You know, they specifically mention the adjuvants, and they've never been approved in the United States.
[02:04:27.345 --> 02:04:30.726]  The adjuvant squaling has never been approved.
[02:04:30.726 --> 02:04:31.226]  Um, so...
[02:04:33.368 --> 02:04:34.409]  You know, that's pretty scary.
[02:04:34.409 --> 02:04:42.794]  It's never been approved, but... But they've been given, they've been given FDA waivers under the pandemic emergency to put it in there.
[02:04:42.794 --> 02:04:45.215]  Yeah, that's like giving someone immunity for murder.
[02:04:45.215 --> 02:04:46.896]  Premeditatedly.
[02:04:46.896 --> 02:04:48.097]  These are eugenicists.
[02:04:48.097 --> 02:04:49.038]  Great points, Sherry.
[02:04:49.038 --> 02:04:53.240]  Glad you checked out the info for yourself and found out it was far worse than I was even saying.
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:55.822]  It always is, folks.
[02:04:55.822 --> 02:04:57.323]  I don't have words to describe it.
[02:04:57.323 --> 02:04:58.643]  One has to see The Matrix.
[02:04:58.643 --> 02:04:59.624]  One can't be told about it.
[02:05:00.845 --> 02:05:05.089]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:05:05.089 --> 02:05:07.091]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:05:07.091 --> 02:05:15.620]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:21.165]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:05:21.165 --> 02:05:22.787]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:05:23.007 --> 02:05:29.532]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:05:29.532 --> 02:05:40.581]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:05:40.581 --> 02:05:41.361]  That's right.

[02:08:29.316 --> 02:08:32.378]  Berg v. Obama, Third Circuit Court of Appeals, number 08-4340.
[02:08:32.378 --> 02:08:32.599]  Berg,
[02:08:36.141 --> 02:08:38.002]  You know I really respect
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:53.461]  Phil Berg.
[02:08:53.461 --> 02:08:58.142]  And I was aware of a lot of his work on the Bill of Rights and Constitution previously.
[02:08:58.142 --> 02:09:01.443]  He was also a Deputy Attorney General of a major state.
[02:09:01.443 --> 02:09:04.285]  He's just done a lot of important work.
[02:09:04.285 --> 02:09:11.907]  And so I first saw him early in the campaign start looking at Obama and the birth certificate.
[02:09:11.907 --> 02:09:13.628]  And we've had him on many times and we've covered it.
[02:09:15.336 --> 02:09:28.201]  I didn't put it in the Obama deception, the big premiere film about Obama, because I knew so many others were covering the birth certificate and that so many Democrats had closed their minds to the birth certificate.
[02:09:28.201 --> 02:09:37.485]  It was seen as partisan, even though Mr. Berg is a registered Democrat and involved, you know, with the ACLU and everything else, a lifelong Democrat, that it wasn't partisan.
[02:09:37.485 --> 02:09:43.568]  It was a constitutional crisis issue and how he could be blackmailed with this info, which is clearly going on now.
[02:09:46.696 --> 02:10:09.371]  So in the Obama deception we cover his carbon tax, his anti-gun stance, his wanting to start all these new wars, lying and hiring nothing but lobbyists, his handlers, the Federal Reserve, people like Geithner who were telling Bush what to do with the bailout, literally his bosses on the financial takeover being Obama's handlers.
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:12.764]  That's why the Obama deception didn't get into it.
[02:10:12.764 --> 02:10:23.723]  It gets into everything that wasn't being covered, everything that wasn't being looked at, while at the same time we've been covering the birther issue, as it's called, here on air.
[02:10:25.023 --> 02:10:26.783]  Now, why do I have Phil Berg here?
[02:10:26.783 --> 02:10:28.444]  Why is he going to be on a lot more?
[02:10:28.444 --> 02:10:38.105]  Why are we going to get Colonel Hollister, who's one of his clients, one of the high-level military officers, coming out and saying, I want to see the birth certificate?
[02:10:38.105 --> 02:10:42.146]  Because it's now reached mega-crest level.
[02:10:42.146 --> 02:10:44.486]  Obama lies and says, I'm not going to hire any lobbyists.
[02:10:44.486 --> 02:10:45.487]  All he hires is lobbyists.
[02:10:45.487 --> 02:10:49.027]  He says he's fighting banker bailout money to Goldman Sachs.
[02:10:49.027 --> 02:10:53.708]  It turns out, and AIG, that he wrote a special piece to the bill to do it.
[02:10:55.236 --> 02:10:57.077]  People know Obama's a liar now.
[02:10:57.077 --> 02:11:03.882]  His approval rating's gone from 84 in the highest for Rasmussen to 49 in six months.
[02:11:03.882 --> 02:11:07.805]  I mean, he is dropping like a rock right now.
[02:11:07.805 --> 02:11:09.767]  In a big way.
[02:11:09.767 --> 02:11:15.151]  And people know that when the media, when the media
[02:11:16.846 --> 02:11:18.507]  Just says there's no truth.
[02:11:18.507 --> 02:11:19.468]  You're kooks.
[02:11:19.468 --> 02:11:22.090]  How dare you ask to look at the birth certificate?
[02:11:22.090 --> 02:11:27.213]  Everybody's seen the birth certificate when they've put out a receipt of birth certificate.
[02:11:27.213 --> 02:11:34.578]  Itself, according to many mainline experts and people matching them with their receipts for birth certificate, is a forgery.
[02:11:34.578 --> 02:11:42.583]  So, people see all this and they're really starting to ask very serious questions.
[02:11:42.583 --> 02:11:42.983]  Then, the
[02:11:47.591 --> 02:11:55.816]  Washington Post comes out and makes fun, and then we're going to Phil Berg, of anybody and everybody that asks questions.
[02:11:55.816 --> 02:11:58.637]  The birther, brouhaha.
[02:11:58.637 --> 02:12:02.319]  Washington Post.
[02:12:02.319 --> 02:12:10.684]  And it says, speculation about the true citizenship of President Barack Obama has resurfaced in recent days, in part thanks to a viral video.
[02:12:10.684 --> 02:12:14.586]  Despite a widely circulated copy of his certificate of live birth,
[02:12:15.737 --> 02:12:21.140]  Notices in two Honolulu newspapers and other evidence, some won't let the issue die.
[02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:37.129]  Fanning the flames are commentators Lou Dobbs and Rush Limbaugh who have suggested the question remains unsolved and 10 House Republicans who have co-sponsored bills that will require presidential candidates to provide a copy of their original birth certificate.
[02:12:38.490 --> 02:12:41.492]  And then they ask this stupid poll question.
[02:12:41.492 --> 02:12:44.534]  What for you would clear up the question of Obama's citizenship?
[02:12:44.534 --> 02:12:49.937]  An official certificate and birth notices from two newspapers?
[02:12:49.937 --> 02:12:51.598]  A time machine visit to the hospital?
[02:12:52.634 --> 02:12:55.156]  On the day of the alleged birth?
[02:12:55.156 --> 02:12:56.757]  Tie him up, throw him in the water.
[02:12:56.757 --> 02:13:00.120]  If he floats, he's an American, saying it's a witch hunt.
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:01.361]  Nothing ever.
[02:13:01.361 --> 02:13:05.844]  So see, this poll is meant to ridicule anybody asking questions.
[02:13:05.844 --> 02:13:13.210]  Even the semi-serious first question, first option, an official certificate, and birth notices from two newspapers.
[02:13:13.210 --> 02:13:15.472]  See, an official birth certificate would have done it.
[02:13:16.092 --> 02:13:17.633]  But they won't do it.
[02:13:17.633 --> 02:13:18.414]  Why?
[02:13:18.414 --> 02:13:22.237]  Why is he signed an executive order blocking the release of that document?
[02:13:22.237 --> 02:13:23.738]  Oh yes!
[02:13:23.738 --> 02:13:28.202]  So see, now we have his grandmother reportedly saying he was born there.
[02:13:28.202 --> 02:13:32.065]  Now we have the government saying they put a plaque up at his birthplace.
[02:13:34.465 --> 02:13:45.476]  I mean, all of this evidence, and now we have the expert, the guy who was there day one on all of this, and my whole issue is I didn't know one way or the other, but the way they act suspicious, the way they act scared.
[02:13:45.476 --> 02:13:47.538]  Then I saw Bill Maher this weekend.
[02:13:47.538 --> 02:13:52.243]  I watched politically, you know, his little propaganda real time with Bill Maher.
[02:13:54.864 --> 02:13:57.785]  He acted scared.
[02:13:57.785 --> 02:13:59.685]  Mrs. Eisenhower on the show acted scared.
[02:13:59.685 --> 02:14:02.266]  They're freaked out, and now I know why.
[02:14:02.266 --> 02:14:12.409]  Everywhere congressmen go, they're shouted down by this issue under the surface because when the mainstream media just pats somebody on the head and says, you've seen the birth certificate, when we haven't,
[02:14:13.229 --> 02:14:23.853]  And when there's all these cover-ups going on, and his mother not being living in the United States long enough when she had him, because you've got to have one parent who's lived here a certain amount of time for him to be present.
[02:14:23.853 --> 02:14:25.854]  He's not eligible that way either.
[02:14:25.854 --> 02:14:27.775]  Any way you cut it, this is crazy.
[02:14:27.775 --> 02:14:30.996]  We now go to Phil Berg, and I appreciate him joining us.
[02:14:30.996 --> 02:14:33.217]  I just wanted to recap the basics.
[02:14:33.217 --> 02:14:35.018]  Obamacrimes.com.
[02:14:35.018 --> 02:14:37.479]  Bottom line, Mr. Berg, what's really going on here?
[02:14:38.237 --> 02:14:39.778]  Well, it's a massive cover-up.
[02:14:39.778 --> 02:14:49.944]  I believe it's the biggest hoax ever put forth to the citizens of this country in over 230 years in the history of our country, and one person's responsible for it.
[02:14:49.944 --> 02:14:54.327]  And that's actually his real name, we believe, is not Barack Hussein Obama.
[02:14:54.327 --> 02:15:00.431]  We believe his legal name today is Barry Sotoro when he was adopted in Indonesia.
[02:15:00.431 --> 02:15:03.153]  And when all was said and done, and the truth will come out,
[02:15:03.593 --> 02:15:18.107]  I think Obama, or Sotomayor, whatever you want to call him, his wife Michelle Obama, Howard Dean, the former head of the Democratic National Committee, other officials of the Democratic National Committee, senior campaign officials, and now senior administration officials who know the truth about this.
[02:15:18.587 --> 02:15:27.214]  Should all be subjected to the criminal justice system and tried, and those that are convicted should go to jail, and Obama should go to jail and then be deported.
[02:15:27.214 --> 02:15:30.116]  This is outrageous, what is going on here.
[02:15:30.116 --> 02:15:35.860]  When Arnold Schwarzenegger, people have talked to him, the governor of California, about running for president, what has he said?
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:36.961]  Amend the Constitution.
[02:15:37.561 --> 02:15:43.186]  And Barack Obama, basically, without saying it is, he's saying, I'm walking all over the Constitution.
[02:15:43.186 --> 02:15:45.207]  I don't care about the Constitution.
[02:15:45.207 --> 02:15:50.031]  Why would all of his records, every record of Obama is sealed?
[02:15:50.031 --> 02:15:51.152]  Every record.
[02:15:51.152 --> 02:15:54.975]  And I'm the first one to give a response on why his college records are being sealed.
[02:15:54.975 --> 02:16:03.663]  I believe his records from Occidental, Columbia University, and Harvard Law School are sealed, because I believe they will show that he applied for and received foreign aid.
[02:16:03.663 --> 02:16:05.104]  This is outrageous.
[02:16:05.524 --> 02:16:14.050]  The national media should be the, I don't know if you saw it on Saturday, the New York Times, they actually quoted one of my quotes they interviewed me because of the upswing with the media.
[02:16:14.050 --> 02:16:20.916]  And I said I wish the national media, including the New York Times, I wish I could sue them for not properly vetting Obama.
[02:16:20.916 --> 02:16:22.176]  This is a total disgrace.
[02:16:22.176 --> 02:16:23.978]  For two years they didn't do anything.
[02:16:24.458 --> 02:16:25.980]  But look what they did to Sarah Palin.
[02:16:25.980 --> 02:16:28.743]  Not that I'm saying I'm for her, but they ripped her apart.
[02:16:28.743 --> 02:16:30.105]  What did they do to Obama?
[02:16:30.105 --> 02:16:33.229]  Anything he says is no big deal.
[02:16:33.229 --> 02:16:35.912]  I love the one when it was getting near the November elections.
[02:16:36.741 --> 02:16:45.090]  And he stated, I'm now in my, I arrived in Oregon, this is my 57th state, and they wouldn't let me go to Alaska or Hawaii.
[02:16:45.090 --> 02:16:49.335]  I didn't know we had 59 states in this country, in this great country of ours.
[02:16:49.335 --> 02:16:50.195]  And you know what?
[02:16:50.195 --> 02:16:54.040]  If anybody else had said that, it would have been front page news for weeks.
[02:16:54.620 --> 02:17:02.047]  Because remember, going back to Dan Quayle, Dan Quayle just misspelled the word potato and they didn't let him live it down.
[02:17:02.047 --> 02:17:04.990]  But Obama gets a free ride no matter what's going on.
[02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:10.255]  I think he just stepped too far when he was commenting on this incident with the police officer the other day.
[02:17:12.077 --> 02:17:21.665]  With everything else, and as you said, Alex, all his promises are turning into fiction at this point because he talks out of both sides of his mouth, but that's not why I'm there.
[02:17:21.665 --> 02:17:24.767]  I'm there to enforce the US Constitution.
[02:17:24.767 --> 02:17:29.651]  I'm there for the 305 million people in this country who deserve to know the truth.
[02:17:29.651 --> 02:17:32.313]  I'm there for our forefathers, and I'm there for the 1.5 million
[02:17:33.954 --> 02:17:34.615]  You know, Mr. Berg,
[02:17:52.987 --> 02:18:03.598]  I don't want to get into conspiracy theories, but were they planning this so they can then have to have an amendment to make a foreign-born president for Schwarzenegger?
[02:18:03.598 --> 02:18:12.607]  I mean, if they knew he was born in Kenya, and this was so unbelievable for me that I had trouble, even though I know you're a credible person,
[02:18:13.368 --> 02:18:13.588]  Yeah.
[02:18:26.423 --> 02:18:30.344]  Like, it's the Kennedy assassination, you know, records or something.
[02:18:30.344 --> 02:18:38.546]  I mean, they're certainly acting suspicious and now they're on TV going, we're scared, you know, these crazies won't listen to us.
[02:18:38.546 --> 02:18:50.950]  We've given them the records when they haven't given us the records and they would have just released the stinking birth certificate and this cover-up of saying they have released all his records when it's not true.
[02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:52.370]  I gotta tell you, Mr. Berg,
[02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:56.331]  You know, I will take my time making a decision about something.
[02:18:56.331 --> 02:18:57.731]  And if I'm not sure, I'll hold back.
[02:18:57.731 --> 02:19:07.213]  But in time, in the fullness of time, hindsight's 20-20, as they say, I gotta tell you, my gut and all the intellectual evidence tells me he was born in Kenya.
[02:19:07.213 --> 02:19:14.695]  It fits in with his dad, the Madrasas, growing up in Indonesia, his real name's Barry Sotero.
[02:19:14.695 --> 02:19:16.876]  Everything about this guy is fake.
[02:19:16.876 --> 02:19:22.437]  How could the CIA, how could the Justice Department, how could the government let him become president
[02:19:22.838 --> 02:19:24.004]  Knowing this would come out!
[02:19:24.923 --> 02:19:35.249]  Well, first off, I've been advised by some high people over in Britain that our FBI and CIA know the truth about him, but there's no reporting.
[02:19:35.249 --> 02:19:41.872]  When you run for president, there's nobody you have to check in and show that you are who you are.
[02:19:41.872 --> 02:19:51.077]  But think about it, he's committed fraud in every one of the states, unless he can show us documentation that he has legally changed his name after being adopted into Indonesia.
[02:19:51.077 --> 02:19:54.299]  By signing his name as Barack Hussein Obama, that would be fraud.
[02:19:54.759 --> 02:19:55.240]  Stay there.
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:57.121]  Yeah, and you're a great legal mind.
[02:19:57.121 --> 02:19:58.583]  He's done hundreds of things.
[02:19:58.583 --> 02:20:01.385]  We'll cover him when we come back.
[02:20:01.385 --> 02:20:02.066]  You worry.
[02:20:02.066 --> 02:20:04.428]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[02:20:04.428 --> 02:20:04.969]  Hi.
[02:20:04.969 --> 02:20:07.751]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[02:20:07.751 --> 02:20:12.296]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[02:20:12.296 --> 02:20:14.778]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[02:20:14.778 --> 02:20:17.801]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[02:20:18.101 --> 02:20:20.042]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[02:20:20.042 --> 02:20:22.824]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[02:20:22.824 --> 02:20:26.547]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[02:20:26.547 --> 02:20:30.970]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[02:20:30.970 --> 02:20:35.053]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[02:20:35.053 --> 02:20:41.397]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[02:20:41.397 --> 02:20:43.759]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[02:20:43.759 --> 02:20:45.400]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[02:20:45.860 --> 02:20:50.510]  So go to offthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:51.431]  Start now.
[02:20:51.431 --> 02:20:53.155]  Knowledge is power.
[02:20:53.155 --> 02:20:54.157]  Better take action.
[02:20:54.157 --> 02:20:55.119]  I think a storm's coming.
[02:21:02.372 --> 02:21:06.836]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[02:21:06.836 --> 02:21:10.579]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[02:21:10.579 --> 02:21:13.462]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[02:21:13.462 --> 02:21:20.047]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[02:21:20.047 --> 02:21:22.390]  The only real option is precious metals.
[02:21:22.390 --> 02:21:28.094]  For your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[02:21:29.059 --> 02:21:32.160]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package.
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:36.681]  And I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[02:21:36.681 --> 02:21:41.101]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[02:21:41.101 --> 02:21:46.723]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[02:21:46.723 --> 02:21:50.623]  And together we can develop a Make Sense program before the clock runs out.
[02:21:50.623 --> 02:21:55.304]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[02:21:55.304 --> 02:21:58.005]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[02:22:01.914 --> 02:22:07.720]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:15.308]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:22:15.308 --> 02:22:21.475]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:21.835 --> 02:22:23.856]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:23.856 --> 02:22:26.358]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:26.358 --> 02:22:37.946]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:22:37.946 --> 02:22:39.607]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.607 --> 02:22:41.468]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:22:41.468 --> 02:22:47.712]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:22:56.646 --> 02:22:58.228]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:58.228 --> 02:22:59.409]  The people strike back!
[02:23:01.878 --> 02:23:07.382]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:23:07.382 --> 02:23:08.182]  and the world.
[02:23:08.182 --> 02:23:12.044]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:23:12.044 --> 02:23:18.548]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:23:18.548 --> 02:23:20.570]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:23:20.570 --> 02:23:25.793]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[02:23:25.993 --> 02:23:26.313]  We're good.
[02:23:41.523 --> 02:23:41.784]  I think so.
[02:24:14.478 --> 02:24:22.343]  Alright, as usual folks, I'm just ranting because for a year or more I've been looking and studying the birther issue.
[02:24:22.343 --> 02:24:24.805]  And you have scales.
[02:24:24.805 --> 02:24:29.648]  And early on there was more evidence that he was born in Kenya than that he was born in Hawaii.
[02:24:31.033 --> 02:24:36.819]  Having a fake name and covering up his history and saying he doesn't have Muslim roots.
[02:24:36.819 --> 02:24:47.510]  I'm not saying that's bad, but lying about it and now saying he does have Muslim roots and saying he's a Muslim on TV and speech after speech and saying it was an accident later, probably done on purpose.
[02:24:50.237 --> 02:24:53.820]  And just all his deception and covering up the college records.
[02:24:53.820 --> 02:25:00.084]  But Attorney Phil Berg has gone over the Constitution, Bill of Rights, him lying, lying on entrance forms.
[02:25:00.084 --> 02:25:06.188]  You were getting to that, Mr. Berg, the first lawyer to speak up, the first guy to file suits.
[02:25:06.188 --> 02:25:11.952]  You were getting into all the lies we know he's told, how you were saying he should be prosecuted for fraud.
[02:25:11.952 --> 02:25:12.473]  Get into that.
[02:25:13.951 --> 02:25:16.232]  Well, I think, first off, let me say this.
[02:25:16.232 --> 02:25:21.275]  Significant is the fact that this has been around on the internet for over two years.
[02:25:21.275 --> 02:25:29.220]  Significant is the fact that in June 2008, two months before I got involved in this, on the Obama campaign website,
[02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:33.604]  They put this document, which they keep trying to say is a birth certificate.
[02:25:33.604 --> 02:25:34.084]  It's not.
[02:25:34.084 --> 02:25:42.532]  It's a certification of live birth, and our expert has determined, and it's on our website, Obamacrimes.com, that the document is a phony.
[02:25:42.532 --> 02:25:43.213]  It's a fraud.
[02:25:43.213 --> 02:25:44.494]  It's been altered.
[02:25:44.494 --> 02:25:52.402]  First off, so when I filed my... I got a phone call at the beginning of August 2008 from an individual I've worked with for years, a young lady, Linda.
[02:25:52.982 --> 02:25:56.326]  And she said, Phil, have you heard about this Obama not being a natural born citizen?
[02:25:56.326 --> 02:25:57.367]  I said, absolutely.
[02:25:57.367 --> 02:25:58.609]  Do you know about it?
[02:25:58.609 --> 02:25:59.430]  I said, not too much.
[02:25:59.430 --> 02:26:00.431]  She said, well, check it out.
[02:26:00.431 --> 02:26:01.632]  She said, it's for real.
[02:26:01.632 --> 02:26:03.434]  He's not natural born.
[02:26:03.434 --> 02:26:06.197]  He has no business being president.
[02:26:06.197 --> 02:26:10.642]  And, Phil, you're the only attorney in the country with brass you-know-whats to Sue Obama.
[02:26:11.343 --> 02:26:13.865]  So I looked into it, and two weeks later I sued Obama.
[02:26:13.865 --> 02:26:16.628]  I sued him August 21st, 2008.
[02:26:16.628 --> 02:26:20.771]  That's significant because that was before the Democratic National Convention.
[02:26:20.771 --> 02:26:24.755]  I sued Obama, and not only Obama, I sued the Democratic National Committee.
[02:26:24.755 --> 02:26:25.976]  Think about it, Al.
[02:26:25.976 --> 02:26:26.816]  Two different roles.
[02:26:26.816 --> 02:26:31.941]  Obama wanted to be president, but the Democratic National Committee, of course, wanted a Democrat as president.
[02:26:31.941 --> 02:26:37.826]  But they had a higher duty, in my opinion, and that is to convey to the American public that they have a qualified candidate.
[02:26:38.266 --> 02:26:43.087]  I expected them to do something they didn't, because they didn't respond before the convention.
[02:26:43.087 --> 02:26:51.208]  He got nominated, he had his big thing at the football stadium, and a month later they filed a joint motion to dismiss, which infuriated me.
[02:26:51.208 --> 02:26:54.209]  It just showed that there was collusion between both of them.
[02:26:54.209 --> 02:26:55.909]  And I really mean that.
[02:26:55.909 --> 02:27:04.611]  When I filed suit August 21st, significantly, and I put out a press release, I said, Obama, if I am incorrect,
[02:27:05.424 --> 02:27:06.826]  Prove me wrong.
[02:27:06.826 --> 02:27:12.814]  Show me your long form, your bold copy of your birth certificate and I'll walk away.
[02:27:12.814 --> 02:27:13.355]  I'll go away.
[02:27:17.495 --> 02:27:18.875]  Did he show that to me?
[02:27:18.875 --> 02:27:21.477]  No, he didn't show that to me.
[02:27:21.477 --> 02:27:22.557]  What did he do?
[02:27:22.557 --> 02:27:22.978]  Nothing.
[02:27:22.978 --> 02:27:26.220]  He didn't respond to that, which is significant.
[02:27:26.220 --> 02:27:28.761]  And the vault copy for your listeners is different.
[02:27:28.761 --> 02:27:41.068]  The vault copy of a birth certificate, and those that have a real birth certificate will know, a vault copy has the weight of the baby, the length of the baby, it has the hospital name, the doctor's name, the doctor's signature.
[02:27:41.748 --> 02:27:46.471]  All of these things which I just mentioned are not on the Sony dis-certification of live birth.
[02:27:46.471 --> 02:27:55.758]  And a certification of live birth, back then, they might have changed it recently in Hawaii, what it's going to be used for, but back then, you could not even register your child for Little League.
[02:27:55.758 --> 02:27:58.639]  You couldn't get a passport on it.
[02:27:58.639 --> 02:28:00.481]  You couldn't even
[02:28:01.994 --> 02:28:04.815]  Uh, get a land grant in Hawaii based upon that.
[02:28:04.815 --> 02:28:08.276]  So, and they keep trying to shove it down our throat.
[02:28:08.276 --> 02:28:12.216]  Like you had Chris Matthews on MSNBC there waving in front of the camera.
[02:28:12.216 --> 02:28:13.997]  Well, hey Chris, watch what you're waving.
[02:28:13.997 --> 02:28:16.277]  You're not waving a birth certificate.
[02:28:16.277 --> 02:28:17.978]  Stop being phony out there.
[02:28:17.978 --> 02:28:23.639]  They're covering it more and more because I think part of what happened with Congressman Cassell in Delaware.
[02:28:23.639 --> 02:28:25.080]  He held a town meeting on June 30, 2009.
[02:28:27.060 --> 02:28:34.804]  Well, that was the point I was going to make, and we're going to play that video when we come back in the next segment or part of it.
[02:28:44.008 --> 02:28:55.470]  Is that this was spontaneous and now other videos are surfacing with Democrat and Republican congressmen being booed and whole crowds are spontaneously angry, even Democrats.
[02:28:55.470 --> 02:29:05.932]  This is a massive underground issue, probably the biggest issue, because I think at a fundamental level, but you're the expert, give me your, you know, inside take on this.
[02:29:05.932 --> 02:29:11.333]  I don't think anybody's got their finger on the pulse of this, like Phil Berg is on line with us right now, but when we come back, I want to ask you,
[02:29:11.673 --> 02:29:13.134]  And we're going to play this clip.
[02:29:13.134 --> 02:29:21.781]  You know, the big question is the main issue that people are insulted by being patted on the head and said, we've shown you the birth certificate.
[02:29:21.781 --> 02:29:23.663]  Sit down and shut up.
[02:29:23.663 --> 02:29:28.166]  When Kenyan newspapers are saying he was born over there and they're proud of it.
[02:29:28.166 --> 02:29:31.889]  His grandmother's running around on video saying he was born over there.
[02:29:31.889 --> 02:29:34.011]  His dad lived over there.
[02:29:34.011 --> 02:29:36.312]  You know, he's got his cousin.
[02:29:37.433 --> 02:29:42.217]  Starting, you know, riots over there with Obama advising him in the Senate how to do it.
[02:29:42.217 --> 02:29:48.922]  You've got Obama operating under another name, lying on college forms, sealing everything.
[02:29:48.922 --> 02:29:51.624]  What's making folks so upset?
[02:29:51.624 --> 02:29:53.025]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.025 --> 02:29:54.626]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.626 --> 02:29:58.229]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.288 --> 02:30:02.969]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.969 --> 02:30:07.711]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:30:07.711 --> 02:30:10.673]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:30:10.673 --> 02:30:13.715]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:30:13.715 --> 02:30:19.558]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:30:19.798 --> 02:30:23.042]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:30:23.042 --> 02:30:30.029]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:30:30.029 --> 02:30:33.313]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:30:33.313 --> 02:30:33.573]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:30:35.976 --> 02:30:38.438]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:30:48.304 --> 02:30:49.826]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:30:49.826 --> 02:30:50.466]  Take action today.
[02:30:50.466 --> 02:30:52.287]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:31:01.015 --> 02:31:05.259]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:31:05.259 --> 02:31:07.261]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:31:07.261 --> 02:31:15.790]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:31:15.790 --> 02:31:21.355]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:31:21.355 --> 02:31:22.977]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:31:23.197 --> 02:31:29.719]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:31:29.719 --> 02:31:40.761]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:31:40.761 --> 02:31:41.522]  That's right.
[02:31:41.522 --> 02:31:44.082]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:31:44.082 --> 02:31:45.683]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:31:48.243 --> 02:32:06.308]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:32:06.308 --> 02:32:08.388]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:32:08.388 --> 02:32:10.829]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:32:10.829 --> 02:32:13.109]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:32:13.109 --> 02:32:14.730]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:32:14.730 --> 02:32:15.770]  There is a solution.
[02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:24.417]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:32:24.417 --> 02:32:31.883]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[02:32:37.927 --> 02:32:43.512]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[02:33:13.876 --> 02:33:24.164]  We're going to take a few calls from Phil Byrd coming up before he leaves us in about 27 minutes.
[02:33:24.164 --> 02:33:24.384]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:24.384 --> 02:33:24.704]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:24.704 --> 02:33:27.587]  Specifically for Phil Byrd on this subject.
[02:33:27.587 --> 02:33:36.293]  We're going to be having him up a lot more in the future because going back last year I said it looked like they were covering up and he was probably born in Kenya.
[02:33:36.293 --> 02:33:38.995]  Or certainly his mother didn't live in the United States long enough.
[02:33:38.995 --> 02:33:40.096]  They have laws on that.
[02:33:42.130 --> 02:33:44.792]  to be able to then him to be president.
[02:33:44.792 --> 02:33:47.193]  Because you can't just have one parent who's a U.S.
[02:33:47.193 --> 02:33:48.955]  citizen, too, and be president.
[02:33:48.955 --> 02:33:58.621]  So we'll break that down with the expert Phil Berg here in just a moment and take your phone calls and play this video that's getting so much attention.
[02:33:58.621 --> 02:34:05.225]  But everywhere I go, people come up to me in grocery store lines and they say, Alex, what's going on with the birth certificate?
[02:34:05.225 --> 02:34:07.867]  And I go, he lies about everything.
[02:34:07.867 --> 02:34:10.289]  His name, Barack Obama, isn't even his real name.
[02:34:11.584 --> 02:34:12.504]  He's covering it up.
[02:34:12.504 --> 02:34:14.105]  Why hasn't he released it?
[02:34:14.105 --> 02:34:20.287]  Why before this was an issue did they post the fake certificate, the receipt?
[02:34:20.287 --> 02:34:29.471]  See, I mean, as an investigator and anybody who's researched any basic criminology, this really looks bad.
[02:34:29.471 --> 02:34:34.373]  But again, to say we're kooks and nuts and bad to want it to be released,
[02:34:35.854 --> 02:34:36.655]  We're not bad.
[02:34:36.655 --> 02:34:37.576]  He needs to prove it.
[02:34:37.576 --> 02:34:44.041]  I mean, you gotta show this to get a driver's license, or to get on welfare, or to join the military, but not to be president?
[02:34:44.041 --> 02:34:50.226]  Going to Philburg in just a moment, I want to tell you about some of the sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[02:34:50.226 --> 02:34:51.828]  One of them is HomeGain.
[02:34:51.828 --> 02:34:56.451]  If you go to InfoWars.com, you can click on Max, the little orange gorilla.
[02:34:56.451 --> 02:34:57.753]  He's their mascot.
[02:34:57.753 --> 02:35:00.495]  And that's if you forget the web address.
[02:35:00.495 --> 02:35:02.737]  It's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[02:35:04.810 --> 02:35:11.835]  And the best part about the site is it can make you or save you a ton of money, and it's absolutely 100% free.
[02:35:11.835 --> 02:35:13.776]  Free, free, free.
[02:35:13.776 --> 02:35:17.059]  It's advertiser-driven.

[02:35:43.199 --> 02:35:44.080]  And lastly...
[02:35:46.750 --> 02:35:55.294]  In these crazy uncertain times with crime exploding, talk of martial law, depression, all this crud, it's not enough to just own firearms.
[02:35:55.294 --> 02:35:58.795]  You see record firearms purchasing going on and ammo purchasing.
[02:35:58.795 --> 02:36:00.396]  You need firearms training.
[02:36:00.396 --> 02:36:06.258]  And you can take a local course and get the basics of safety, but then the next level is front sight.
[02:36:06.258 --> 02:36:11.401]  And long before they were a sponsor, this was the name of above law enforcement and military training.
[02:36:11.401 --> 02:36:11.921]  But it's not
[02:36:12.441 --> 02:36:14.682]  A Rambo attitude tough guy thing.

[02:36:39.775 --> 02:36:47.702]  If I wasn't tied down, making films, and writing books, and running the radio show, and doing all the stuff I'm doing, I would be at front sight.
[02:36:47.702 --> 02:36:52.546]  I almost went to front sight nine years ago, because everybody I know is telling me how great it is.
[02:36:52.546 --> 02:36:58.370]  I've gotten rusty on my Second Amendment, and I used to be just an unbelievable, a scary shot, folks.
[02:36:58.370 --> 02:37:00.732]  I got into the same hole with a deer rifle at 200 yards.
[02:37:00.732 --> 02:37:02.194]  Now I'm lucky to hit the bullseye.
[02:37:03.044 --> 02:37:04.424]  You need your training.
[02:37:04.424 --> 02:37:07.605]  It's four and five-day courses, super inexpensive.

[02:37:15.127 --> 02:37:19.529]  Okay, going now to our esteemed guest, Obamacrimes.com.
[02:37:19.529 --> 02:37:24.110]  I really appreciate his courage, his doggedness, his stick-to-it-ness.
[02:37:24.890 --> 02:37:27.692]  And his instinct to get on this case.
[02:37:27.692 --> 02:37:37.420]  And before, we'd interview Mr. Berg a year ago about this, more than a year ago, and he'd say, well, I'm a Democrat, I like Obama, I just, you know, where there's smoke, there's fire.
[02:37:37.420 --> 02:37:49.470]  Now, a lot more has come out, run through before we go to calls, more of the evidence of the cover-up and the fact that this is building and that, well, that first question before we hit the break, Mr. Berg,
[02:37:50.371 --> 02:37:52.614]  Why is it now exploding?
[02:37:52.614 --> 02:37:56.439]  Is it the way the media just dismisses everybody?
[02:37:56.439 --> 02:37:59.504]  And the way Obama's been caught lying about so much other stuff?
[02:38:00.799 --> 02:38:04.902]  Well, I think it's because, number one, Obama's dropping in the polls.
[02:38:04.902 --> 02:38:07.124]  He's not coming through on the various proposals.
[02:38:07.124 --> 02:38:09.545]  He said he was going to be the candidate of change.
[02:38:09.545 --> 02:38:15.730]  And when you said, I think he's even set himself up to be blackmailed, and I think he could be blackmailed already.
[02:38:15.730 --> 02:38:16.630]  Think about it.
[02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:17.591]  Candidate of change.
[02:38:17.591 --> 02:38:20.233]  His cabinet is 70% Bill Clinton.
[02:38:20.233 --> 02:38:21.714]  Who's his Secretary of Defense?
[02:38:22.114 --> 02:38:24.975]  Bill Gates left over from Bush?
[02:38:24.975 --> 02:38:26.355]  Does that even make sense?
[02:38:26.355 --> 02:38:27.476]  It doesn't make sense.
[02:38:27.476 --> 02:38:33.238]  And he recently talked about reducing the restrictions on travel to Cuba.
[02:38:33.238 --> 02:38:36.879]  Perhaps Cuba, perhaps Castro has a copy of his documentation.
[02:38:36.879 --> 02:38:39.200]  What happens when China and Russia get it?
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:40.680]  What happens when Iran gets it?
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:46.202]  Because you know these papers are around there, and you know some of these foreign governments will pay a million dollars for it.
[02:38:46.202 --> 02:38:48.863]  But talking about a million dollars, why would Obama
[02:38:49.543 --> 02:38:51.124]  You know, I gotta stop you, Phil.
[02:38:51.124 --> 02:38:52.604]  Incredible point.
[02:38:52.604 --> 02:38:58.766]  All the time they catch clerks at DMVs selling 10,000 fake driver's licenses, 3,000 bucks a piece.
[02:38:58.766 --> 02:38:59.807]  They're getting millions.
[02:38:59.807 --> 02:39:03.348]  They're constantly catching federal clerks selling data.
[02:39:03.348 --> 02:39:08.010]  You better believe foreign governments would pay 10 million bucks for the proof.
[02:39:09.165 --> 02:39:09.926]  Absolutely.
[02:39:09.926 --> 02:39:11.927]  What happens when Iran gets approved?
[02:39:11.927 --> 02:39:13.448]  What's that going to cost us?
[02:39:13.448 --> 02:39:19.991]  And perhaps that's why when Obama travels overseas, every place he's going he's been apologizing to the United States.
[02:39:19.991 --> 02:39:23.033]  What about bowing before the King of Saudi Arabia?
[02:39:23.033 --> 02:39:23.914]  Unbelievable.
[02:39:23.914 --> 02:39:24.434]  Unbelievable.
[02:39:24.434 --> 02:39:26.775]  And did the media make a big thing about that?
[02:39:26.775 --> 02:39:27.736]  Not at all.
[02:39:27.736 --> 02:39:29.177]  He gets a free ride.
[02:39:29.177 --> 02:39:31.158]  Like I said, I wish we could sue the national media.
[02:39:31.158 --> 02:39:34.240]  I think though, because of what's happening at these town meetings,
[02:39:35.181 --> 02:39:38.807]  That tape went out and other people now are being questioned about it.
[02:39:38.807 --> 02:39:41.150]  It's now spreading out to more and more people.
[02:39:41.150 --> 02:39:50.164]  Like you said, people must show their own, your listeners have to show their birth certificate for Little League, for driver's license, for college, for marriage, different things in different states.
[02:39:50.504 --> 02:39:54.345]  But for a passport, why is Obama getting a free ride?
[02:39:54.345 --> 02:39:55.585]  Somebody said he loves it.
[02:39:55.585 --> 02:39:59.806]  He loves being out there with us because it diverts attention from other things.
[02:39:59.806 --> 02:40:02.967]  I disagree with that person the other day on the air on a different show.
[02:40:02.967 --> 02:40:04.287]  He doesn't want this thing.
[02:40:04.287 --> 02:40:08.168]  He had hoped it would go away with this document two months before I got into it.
[02:40:08.168 --> 02:40:14.709]  And I'm proud to say that I'm glad I got into it because since I have, it's mushroomed into lawsuits all across this country.
[02:40:15.189 --> 02:40:21.455]  Which didn't get the media attention, but they're now getting the media attention because you have congressmen.
[02:40:21.455 --> 02:40:37.449]  One congressman introduced a new bill, a new piece of legislation, which he's gotten seven other Republicans, a Republican introduced it, saying that as of the year 2012, anyone running for president should have to show proof that they are a natural-born citizen.
[02:40:37.449 --> 02:40:39.351]  Well, why are no Democrats sorting into that?
[02:40:39.671 --> 02:40:41.934]  Because they all know that he's not natural born.
[02:40:41.934 --> 02:40:46.258]  They won't join into it because that's what Obama plans to run for re-election.
[02:40:46.258 --> 02:40:49.702]  But I hope to legally remove him from office before that.
[02:40:49.702 --> 02:40:53.306]  We're not in a financial crisis in this country.
[02:40:53.306 --> 02:40:55.309]  We have a constitutional crisis.
[02:40:55.309 --> 02:40:55.949]  Think about it.
[02:40:55.949 --> 02:41:00.815]  Every law that he's signed, every appointment that he's made, is void or voidable.
[02:41:01.535 --> 02:41:04.759]  And look what he's doing now to even bypass Congress.
[02:41:04.759 --> 02:41:06.041]  He's appointing a czar.
[02:41:06.041 --> 02:41:08.644]  I think he's up to 19 czars or something like that.
[02:41:08.644 --> 02:41:12.868]  Each czar is going to spend 10 to 20 million dollars for their staff.
[02:41:12.868 --> 02:41:17.434]  Because a czar doesn't have to, it's not a cabinet person, doesn't have to go through the scrutiny of the Senate.
[02:41:18.414 --> 02:41:24.278]  Not that the scrutiny of the Congress is so good anymore because of what they've done here.
[02:41:24.278 --> 02:41:26.400]  They've been giving a rubber stamp to this guy.
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:28.361]  That's a disgrace.
[02:41:28.361 --> 02:41:30.342]  And that's why I have the three lawsuits pending.
[02:41:30.342 --> 02:41:32.924]  The case is significant right now.
[02:41:32.924 --> 02:41:39.448]  I mentioned the Hollister case, but a significant one is, for your listeners, I filed a case that was sealed back in November 7, 2008.
[02:41:41.249 --> 02:41:42.650]  And I couldn't talk about it.
[02:41:42.650 --> 02:41:44.952]  It wasn't sealed because I filed against Obama.
[02:41:44.952 --> 02:41:51.336]  It was sealed because it was filed under what's called the False Claims Act, or QUITAM, Q-U-I-T-A-M.
[02:41:51.336 --> 02:41:53.517]  All False Claims Act cases are sealed.
[02:41:53.517 --> 02:41:57.820]  The basic False Claims Act comes against for Medicaid and Medicare fraud.
[02:41:57.820 --> 02:42:01.763]  It's like one of your listeners right now, their neighborhood's ripping off the government.
[02:42:01.763 --> 02:42:10.909]  So they would file this action against the neighbor, and they would now file on behalf of themselves, and as the relater on behalf of the United States government,
[02:42:11.409 --> 02:42:14.812]  The government is served, but your neighbor is not served.
[02:42:14.812 --> 02:42:18.235]  So in my case, the government was served, but Obama was not served.
[02:42:18.235 --> 02:42:21.978]  It gives the government 60 days to review the case to make one of three decisions.
[02:42:21.978 --> 02:42:24.080]  One, that they will prosecute the case.
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:27.683]  Two, that the relator can prosecute the case on behalf of the government.
[02:42:27.683 --> 02:42:31.045]  Or three, to close out the case and not prosecute it.
[02:42:31.045 --> 02:42:33.147]  Well, very few cases are closed.
[02:42:33.147 --> 02:42:39.713]  But what happened in my case, when I filed it, number one, the 60 days stretched into about six months because they got extensions.
[02:42:40.313 --> 02:42:43.496]  They filed for a motion to dismiss the action.
[02:42:43.496 --> 02:42:44.256]  I filed it.
[02:42:44.256 --> 02:42:45.097]  Interesting case.
[02:42:45.097 --> 02:42:53.003]  When we went to court, because it was a sealed case, I couldn't talk about it, the actual, when the attorneys arrived in the room, everyone there, they locked the door.
[02:42:53.003 --> 02:42:54.625]  The windows in the back were actually covered.
[02:42:54.625 --> 02:42:56.626]  I mean, this was a sealed case.
[02:42:56.626 --> 02:42:58.588]  At the end of the prison, the judge walks out and says,
[02:42:59.208 --> 02:43:03.673]  I just want you to know, Mr. Berg, that this is the D.C.
[02:43:03.673 --> 02:43:05.434]  Federal Court, and the D.C.
[02:43:05.434 --> 02:43:13.062]  Court of Appeals, they have their own Court of Appeals because there's so many cases against the government, has ruled that I can give no input in this case.
[02:43:13.062 --> 02:43:17.667]  So at the end of your presentation, it'll be up to the government whether they want to proceed or not.
[02:43:17.667 --> 02:43:19.569]  How outrageous is that?
[02:43:19.569 --> 02:43:20.950]  So what I did is, I did proceed.
[02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:22.432]  For those that don't know, hold on.
[02:43:22.992 --> 02:43:25.375]  Mr. Berg, you're dropping bombshell after bombshell.
[02:43:25.375 --> 02:43:29.199]  So they're not even following proper judicial proceedings.
[02:43:29.199 --> 02:43:35.346]  They've now turned it into a pure kangaroo court with the judge saying, my hands are tied.
[02:43:35.346 --> 02:43:39.931]  I mean, that right there lets us know this is thermal nuclear level.
[02:43:39.931 --> 02:43:42.755]  They're definitely desperate to cover this up.
[02:43:43.328 --> 02:43:44.949]  Well, you have to know on that.
[02:43:44.949 --> 02:43:48.571]  They said, I mean, before me, they said False Claims Act, they can't have input.
[02:43:48.571 --> 02:43:56.335]  Different than the Ninth Circuit in California, because the law, and I'll go along with the Ninth Circuit, because it says that the relator can have a hearing.
[02:43:56.335 --> 02:44:01.398]  Well, if you're going to have a hearing, and the hearing's in front of a judge, why would you have a hearing with no input from a judge?
[02:44:01.398 --> 02:44:02.379]  It just doesn't make sense.
[02:44:02.879 --> 02:44:04.862]  So he has to recuse himself, but obviously he doesn't.
[02:44:19.286 --> 02:44:27.954]  Right, we asked him to recuse himself, either appoint me, let me proceed with the case, or if they want further questions about the case, to appoint a special prosecutor.
[02:44:27.954 --> 02:44:33.638]  Their response was, believe it or not, well Eric Holder hasn't signed any of the pleadings in this case.
[02:44:33.638 --> 02:44:35.520]  Who's your boss, you assistant?
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:36.441]  You know what I mean?
[02:44:36.441 --> 02:44:37.642]  Who's your boss?
[02:44:37.642 --> 02:44:39.684]  Is there a conflict of interest in Eric Holder?
[02:44:39.684 --> 02:44:43.287]  Number one, he was on Obama's campaign committee staff.
[02:44:43.707 --> 02:44:48.629]  Okay, Phil, in the time we've got left, because you've got your, again, finger on the pulse of this more than anybody out there,
[02:45:15.015 --> 02:45:23.586]  As best you can tell from your deep research and all your sources out there, what's the real chain of events?
[02:45:23.586 --> 02:45:24.607]  Born in Kenya?
[02:45:24.607 --> 02:45:26.390]  When did he come to the U.S.?
[02:45:26.390 --> 02:45:29.053]  Why is he covering up the college papers?
[02:45:29.053 --> 02:45:31.616]  And where do you see all this going?
[02:45:31.616 --> 02:45:32.818]  How do you see this playing out?
[02:45:33.393 --> 02:45:39.674]  Well, it's going to be tough unless we get the public behind us, because right now the courts aren't getting us, letting us have any discovery.
[02:45:39.674 --> 02:45:46.876]  I mean, the court in Philadelphia, that case which is coming up for a hearing in October, the Third Circuit, deals with the fact that I don't have standing.
[02:45:46.876 --> 02:45:52.017]  With that, for your listeners, they mean I don't have standing, Alex Jones doesn't have standing, and none of you listening to the show has standing.
[02:45:52.017 --> 02:45:52.537]  A U.S.
[02:45:52.537 --> 02:45:56.338]  citizen doesn't have standing to enforce the Constitution, which is asinine.
[02:45:56.738 --> 02:45:57.979]  Isn't that asinine?
[02:45:57.979 --> 02:46:01.082]  Especially the 10th Amendment where it goes back to we the people.
[02:46:01.082 --> 02:46:05.345]  The second, the Hollister case is a good case and then we'll try to get him on the air with you.
[02:46:05.345 --> 02:46:12.431]  That's the Air Force colonel saying, can I obey your order or can I legally disobey your order because you're a usurper.
[02:46:12.891 --> 02:46:17.435]  And the third one, which is the pressing one, which hopefully we'll be hearing soon on is the False Claims Act.
[02:46:17.435 --> 02:46:19.216]  In that case, though, I found it a little different.
[02:46:19.216 --> 02:46:29.284]  That was Berg v. Soturo, because I'm claiming in that case that Barry Soturo is an illegal alien, therefore his three and a half years as a U.S.
[02:46:29.284 --> 02:46:34.348]  Senator was a fraud, and therefore his salary and benefits of over a million dollars should come back to the U.S.
[02:46:34.348 --> 02:46:35.149]  Treasury.
[02:46:35.149 --> 02:46:40.974]  So for them not to allow me to proceed, if we proceed in that case, as soon as we get discovery in any case,
[02:46:41.929 --> 02:46:46.714]  We'll have, Obama will have to be out of office, I am sure.
[02:46:46.714 --> 02:46:52.340]  Listen, if he was born in Hawaii, he would have produced his vault copy of his birth certificate.
[02:46:52.340 --> 02:47:01.469]  People say the governor saw it, the officials there, if you look at their statements very carefully, and I'll send you a copy of a letter, you can post it if you want, that I sent to Lou Dobbs to clear his act up.
[02:47:02.369 --> 02:47:04.811]  They never said, they said they saw a birth certificate.
[02:47:04.811 --> 02:47:07.072]  They never said it's from Hawaii.
[02:47:07.072 --> 02:47:09.673]  And if it was, they would have said it, you would have seen it.
[02:47:09.673 --> 02:47:16.036]  His records at colleges are sealed because I'm sure it's to show that he applied for and received foreign aid.
[02:47:16.036 --> 02:47:17.637]  I mean, we don't have his medical records.
[02:47:17.637 --> 02:47:18.858]  Well, it's more than that.
[02:47:18.858 --> 02:47:20.379]  I have a copy of my vault.
[02:47:20.379 --> 02:47:21.359]  It's like a blueprint.
[02:47:21.359 --> 02:47:23.700]  It's like stamped on there.
[02:47:23.700 --> 02:47:28.263]  It's not the receipts that everybody gets and uses for regular business.
[02:47:28.903 --> 02:47:30.425]  And it's such a simple thing.
[02:47:30.425 --> 02:47:39.899]  I think everybody, because they have a birth certificate, knows that when they're being shown a receipt and told, you're stupid, this is a birth certificate, that it insults their intelligence.
[02:47:39.899 --> 02:47:44.365]  And then they find out about the Barry Satoro and his dad and the communism and...
[02:47:45.729 --> 02:47:46.690]  Here's the bigger question.
[02:47:46.690 --> 02:47:53.834]  We know, Phil, the establishment isn't going to let somebody in like this, knowing this, unless they plan to use it.
[02:47:53.834 --> 02:48:00.457]  The more I look at it, it looks like they picked him and chose him just because he was so compromised.
[02:48:00.457 --> 02:48:04.499]  And they've known this the whole time and just wanted to hold it over his head.
[02:48:04.499 --> 02:48:09.502]  And then now you and millions of others are sabotaging their little game plan.
[02:48:09.502 --> 02:48:12.284]  And you can say, well, they'll ignore us in the courts.
[02:48:13.004 --> 02:48:16.907]  And, you know, World Not Illegal put up some billboards.
[02:48:16.907 --> 02:48:24.733]  But the issue is, in the court of public opinion, I think this is one of the other things that is destroying him right now.
[02:48:24.733 --> 02:48:30.898]  So, we're going to convict him either way because he continues to cover up the truth.
[02:48:31.687 --> 02:48:51.737]  I think we're going to force, if we can get the number of people to increase, we can, I hit it, you hit it right on the head, the court of public opinion, we can, if we can, let's say we get 75 million people to follow Alex Jones, Phil Berg, our website, if we can on a certain day say, tomorrow, everyone should call the White House switchboard and demand to see the birth certificate, we can blow out their switchboard.
[02:48:52.157 --> 02:48:55.078]  The next day we can call ABC, NBC, CBS.
[02:48:55.078 --> 02:48:56.999]  We can ask people to email letters.
[02:48:56.999 --> 02:49:01.121]  We can get very easy, get I think it's five or six people, to stand at a major intersection.
[02:49:01.121 --> 02:49:05.583]  He's holding a sign so it spells out, Obama, where is your birth certificate?
[02:49:05.583 --> 02:49:14.567]  At a busy intersection, and we're going to do this off of obamacrimes.com, a busy intersection at rush hour could hit between 5 and 20,000 people depending on, you know,
[02:49:14.787 --> 02:49:21.934]  Regardless, this is a practice action in mass mobilization and taking action.
[02:49:21.934 --> 02:49:24.837]  This is how we save the country.
[02:49:24.837 --> 02:49:26.618]  Again, I go back to what you said, Phil.
[02:49:26.618 --> 02:49:31.022]  They will not release the original birth certificate and this game
[02:49:31.863 --> 02:49:34.824]  This lady in red has had her hand up for some time.
[02:50:04.451 --> 02:50:05.672]  Thank you.
[02:50:05.672 --> 02:50:13.300]  Congressman Castle, I want to know, I have a birth certificate here.
[02:50:14.241 --> 02:50:29.387]  From the United States of America saying I'm an American citizen with a seal on it, signed by a doctor, with the hospital administrator's name, my parents, my date of birth, the time, the date.
[02:50:29.387 --> 02:50:39.511]  I want to go back to January 20th and I want to know why are you people ignoring his birth certificate?
[02:50:43.868 --> 02:50:44.208]  Back it up.
[02:50:44.208 --> 02:50:45.369]  We're going to come back and finish it.
[02:50:45.369 --> 02:50:47.572]  Then we're going to take calls in the next segment.
[02:50:47.572 --> 02:50:51.876]  Five minutes after that, then we have another guest coming up to also talk about Obama.
[02:50:51.876 --> 02:50:53.758]  But here's the Rasmussen poll.
[02:50:53.758 --> 02:50:56.660]  He's fallen below 50.
[02:50:56.660 --> 02:51:01.125]  He has the lowest approval rating of any president in modern history at this point in his administration.
[02:51:01.795 --> 02:51:12.365]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:51:12.365 --> 02:51:13.787]  Garden in a can!

[02:52:01.300 --> 02:52:02.721]  It is a big idea.
[02:52:02.721 --> 02:52:05.523]  A New World Order.
[02:52:05.523 --> 02:52:10.425]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:52:10.425 --> 02:52:13.247]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:52:13.247 --> 02:52:16.029]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[02:52:16.029 --> 02:52:19.231]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:52:19.231 --> 02:52:26.535]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:52:29.571 --> 02:52:35.015]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:52:35.015 --> 02:52:38.877]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:52:38.877 --> 02:52:41.459]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:52:41.459 --> 02:52:42.620]  Most people have no idea.
[02:52:42.620 --> 02:52:43.400]  They're not after money.
[02:52:43.400 --> 02:52:44.681]  They have all the money they need.
[02:52:44.681 --> 02:52:45.662]  They're after power.
[02:52:45.662 --> 02:52:46.803]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:52:55.068 --> 02:52:56.289]  Endgame.
[02:52:56.289 --> 02:52:58.350]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:52:58.350 --> 02:52:59.451]  You have been warned.
[02:53:00.392 --> 02:53:03.494]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:53:03.494 --> 02:53:09.019]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:53:09.019 --> 02:53:14.744]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:53:14.744 --> 02:53:16.205]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:53:16.205 --> 02:53:25.213]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:53:25.513 --> 02:53:27.355]  Now compare a Kalben Pure Soap.
[02:53:27.355 --> 02:53:31.580]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[02:54:13.588 --> 02:54:25.038]  Signed by a doctor, with the hospital administrator's name, my parents, my date of birth, the time, the date.
[02:54:25.038 --> 02:54:34.066]  I want to get back to January 20th and I want to know why are you people ignoring his birth certificate?
[02:55:11.098 --> 02:55:13.860]  I don't know what comment that invites.
[02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:17.283]  If you're referring to the President there, he is a citizen of the United States.
[02:55:17.283 --> 02:55:26.531]  I don't know if he is a citizen of the United States.
[02:55:26.531 --> 02:55:27.752]  Maybe, but we're getting started.
[02:55:27.752 --> 02:55:29.913]  Starting to build on something.
[02:55:35.936 --> 02:55:42.777]  All right, folks.
[02:55:42.777 --> 02:55:43.597]  That's enough.
[02:55:43.597 --> 02:55:46.678]  You can watch the rest of it up on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:46.678 --> 02:55:52.799]  In fact, show folks a smaller bubble of that video so they can see the title of it and find it for themselves on YouTube or on the web.
[02:55:52.799 --> 02:55:57.560]  It's titled, uh, McCassell on Peebo's birth certificate.
[02:55:57.560 --> 02:56:00.081]  Now, the issue here
[02:56:02.148 --> 02:56:08.854]  I mean, this one version has 700,000 views, or to be technical, 697,000 views.
[02:56:08.854 --> 02:56:21.125]  The issue here, this is what's scaring the establishment, is they all start chanting and standing up and screaming at him in a spontaneous verbal riot, almost.
[02:56:21.125 --> 02:56:24.628]  I think that shows the numbers are bigger than 25 million people.
[02:56:24.628 --> 02:56:26.629]  You've had a random congressional event.
[02:56:27.330 --> 02:56:35.180]  With Congressman Castle that the majority, and I'm watching those people closely, get up and are screaming.
[02:56:35.180 --> 02:56:37.362]  And you notice he said he is a citizen.
[02:56:37.362 --> 02:56:40.606]  Yeah, you can be a citizen and be born in Austria.
[02:56:40.606 --> 02:56:43.690]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is a citizen, but he's not eligible to be president.
[02:56:43.690 --> 02:56:44.171]  Phil Berg.
[02:56:46.820 --> 02:57:02.045]  It's growing bigger and bigger because they don't know how to respond and they're all saying that we've seen the birth certificate and if we get the word out they haven't seen the birth certificate and the reason they won't show the birth certificate, if they show it he's done because the birth certificate will show he was born in Kenya.
[02:57:02.045 --> 02:57:09.267]  I have on our website the paternal grandmother Sarah Obama's statement in Swahili that she was in the hospital.
[02:57:09.267 --> 02:57:10.548]  She was there when he was born.
[02:57:11.028 --> 02:57:11.728]  Why doesn't he take care?
[02:57:11.728 --> 02:57:13.309]  Why doesn't he take care of all his family?
[02:57:13.309 --> 02:57:14.809]  I got family that I help out some.
[02:57:14.809 --> 02:57:16.629]  He doesn't even care about brothers?
[02:57:16.629 --> 02:57:18.110]  He doesn't care about grandmothers?
[02:57:18.110 --> 02:57:21.150]  I mean, that right there, boy, this is not a very compassionate person.
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:38.341]  Well, his aunt is living in Boston.
[02:57:38.341 --> 02:57:41.483]  I tried to visit with her, but she wouldn't talk to me.
[02:57:41.483 --> 02:57:47.268]  She's up in Boston, who's here an avid illegal alien, and I think that's the same status as Obama.
[02:57:47.268 --> 02:57:50.270]  His half-brother's living in Kenya on a dollar a month.
[02:57:50.270 --> 02:57:56.094]  I mean, he gave supposedly Odinga, his cousin over there, he gave over a million dollars.
[02:57:56.094 --> 02:58:03.179]  Odinga lost the election, but then he burned down churches with people in it, and they finally put him in office to stop some of the
[02:58:06.501 --> 02:58:07.421]  That's the other issue.
[02:58:07.421 --> 02:58:08.842]  You're not just saying that, Phil.
[02:58:08.842 --> 02:58:13.125]  I mean, the Senate letters from Obama advising how to riot.
[02:58:13.125 --> 02:58:15.726]  He's like a savage revolutionary.
[02:58:15.726 --> 02:58:17.788]  My God, he's setting up a dictatorship.
[02:58:17.788 --> 02:58:19.128]  Phil, stay there five more minutes.
[02:58:19.128 --> 02:58:21.810]  We'll take a few calls from William, David, Ron, and Daniel.
[02:58:21.810 --> 02:58:23.631]  I have quick questions, folks, for Phil Byrd.
[02:58:23.631 --> 02:58:26.493]  We're going to have Phil Byrd back up again next week.
[02:58:26.493 --> 02:58:31.035]  And yes, the last interview for the new Obama film is Phil Byrd.
[02:58:31.035 --> 02:58:32.977]  We're going to interview him this weekend.
[02:58:33.837 --> 02:58:37.139]  So that will be in the new film as well.
[02:58:37.139 --> 02:58:38.560]  This is huge.
[02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:41.562]  Stay with us.
[02:58:41.562 --> 02:58:47.186]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.186 --> 02:58:51.329]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:51.329 --> 02:58:56.513]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:58:56.513 --> 02:58:57.053]  Number one,
[02:58:57.313 --> 02:59:01.237]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:01.237 --> 02:59:06.442]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:06.442 --> 02:59:07.102]  It's true.
[02:59:07.102 --> 02:59:12.447]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:12.447 --> 02:59:18.733]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:59:18.733 --> 02:59:21.356]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:59:21.616 --> 02:59:25.277]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:25.277 --> 02:59:26.137]  Number 5.
[02:59:26.137 --> 02:59:29.999]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:59:29.999 --> 02:59:35.720]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[02:59:54.153 --> 02:59:56.555]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.555 --> 02:59:59.318]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:13.165 --> 03:00:15.406]  Obama's approval rating plunging.
[03:00:15.406 --> 03:00:23.229]  No president, even Jimmy Carter or George W. Bush, went down to below 50 in the first 7-8 months.
[03:00:23.229 --> 03:00:24.170]  This is an all-time low.
[03:00:24.170 --> 03:00:25.611]  We'll cover that later.
[03:00:25.611 --> 03:00:29.132]  Take a few calls here.
[03:00:29.132 --> 03:00:33.194]  We're going to have him back up next week so you can talk to him more.
[03:00:33.194 --> 03:00:35.415]  For Phil Berg, Obamacrimes.com.
[03:00:35.415 --> 03:00:37.816]  William in Delaware, you're on the air with Phil Berg.
[03:00:37.816 --> 03:00:38.136]  Go ahead.
[03:00:39.258 --> 03:00:44.280]  I want to thank Phil for taking on the legal aspect of this whole situation.
[03:00:44.280 --> 03:00:54.384]  And Alex, I want to thank you and Jason and Luke out there for showing me what a powerful weapon that video camera is.
[03:00:54.384 --> 03:01:00.107]  Because without that, there wasn't anybody else down there that day actually recording this stuff.
[03:01:00.647 --> 03:01:10.859]  And I stuck four or five different videos from the footage that I got there that day and put them out there and that one just took off.
[03:01:10.859 --> 03:01:11.479]  Wait, wait, wait.
[03:01:11.479 --> 03:01:12.280]  The footage of what?
[03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:13.462]  Footage of Phil Berg?
[03:01:14.594 --> 03:01:19.962]  No, I'm the creator of the woman in the red shirt video here in Delaware.
[03:01:19.962 --> 03:01:21.965]  Wow, what a small world!
[03:01:21.965 --> 03:01:26.232]  So you're saying you're one of my listeners, you learn from us.
[03:01:26.232 --> 03:01:30.218]  I'm an official InfoWarrior, Alex, and I'm proud to be one.
[03:01:30.698 --> 03:01:37.940]  Well, and now this thing's got millions and millions of views, hundreds of different versions, some of them 700, some of them 500,000 views apiece.
[03:01:37.940 --> 03:01:47.943]  Phil, how exciting that the guy that shot the video, hey, what was it like seeing this huge spontaneous awakening where, I mean, you were in that crowd.
[03:01:47.943 --> 03:01:52.444]  It looks like from the video that like 80, 90% of the people are yelling, yeah, yeah.
[03:01:52.444 --> 03:01:54.085]  I mean, what did you see?
[03:01:54.085 --> 03:01:55.085]  It was about that.
[03:01:55.845 --> 03:01:57.427]  ...stage for this thing.
[03:01:57.427 --> 03:02:02.793]  This was a town hall listening tour that was going to be about healthcare.
[03:02:02.793 --> 03:02:08.220]  He put it three days after his vote for cap-and-trade.
[03:02:08.220 --> 03:02:13.847]  Eighty to ninety percent of the people that were there were there because of his vote for that cap-and-trade bill.
[03:02:14.482 --> 03:02:23.869]  Well listen, William, I want to say right now, we will put it in the film if you will send us the footage of that lady and make the point because it'd be higher quality.
[03:02:23.869 --> 03:02:28.113]  Can I put you on hold and give you our FedEx number and will you let us use that in the new Obama film?
[03:02:28.977 --> 03:02:32.440]  Absolutely, and I've got one other thing to plug.
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:43.248]  After the meeting, I got up one-on-one with Mike Castle, and the audio is not great on it, but it's actually posted as a video response to this first one.
[03:02:43.248 --> 03:02:48.952]  And I'm asking him about a forced vaccination bill, whether he would vote for it.
[03:02:48.952 --> 03:02:56.078]  He flip-flops on it, and eventually at the end he says yes, under certain circumstances he would vote to forcibly vaccinate us.
[03:02:58.039 --> 03:03:02.665]  And it wouldn't be a violation of the Fourth Amendment, which frankly I think is disgusting.
[03:03:03.567 --> 03:03:04.568]  This is incredible.
[03:03:04.568 --> 03:03:19.878]  You know what, William, I'm gonna put you on hold right now, get your name and number, and I'm going to call you in a little while and give you our FedEx number, but I'd like to have you on for maybe 10, 15 minutes next time, next week, when we do two hours on this subject.
[03:03:19.878 --> 03:03:26.883]  But look, every time I turn around, it is our listeners that are trailblazing on every big issue.
[03:03:26.883 --> 03:03:29.925]  William, you warm my heart, you made my day, God bless you.
[03:03:30.646 --> 03:03:37.408]  Hey, thanks Alex, and I also want to put a plug out to the Oath Keepers, because I'm constantly pushing those guys for our troops.
[03:03:37.408 --> 03:03:39.049]  We'll do that, but we've got to say bye.
[03:03:39.049 --> 03:03:41.329]  Look, I'll just have you back on.
[03:03:41.329 --> 03:03:43.530]  Get his name and number, John.
[03:03:43.530 --> 03:03:45.451]  Phil, I'm going to have you back up next week.
[03:03:45.451 --> 03:03:55.394]  My team's coming up this weekend to interview you for the film, but in closing, and I meant to get to other calls, but that caller had, look at what a small world it is that it's one of our listeners that did that.
[03:03:55.933 --> 03:03:57.034]  That's wonderful.
[03:03:57.034 --> 03:04:03.261]  You know, the big thing is, if everyone can go to my website and send it to everyone on their address book, Obamacrimes.com.
[03:04:03.261 --> 03:04:08.386]  Listeners, go to it, send it to everyone on your address book, and ask them to send it on and on and on.
[03:04:08.386 --> 03:04:13.712]  And if you can make a contribution to us as closely, we want to get sign boards up that mean something.
[03:04:13.712 --> 03:04:16.495]  We want signs going up, Obama, where's your birth certificate?
[03:04:16.875 --> 03:04:23.863]  We want to have bumper stickers or metallic things you can put on the side of your car that say, Obama, where's your birth certificate?
[03:04:23.863 --> 03:04:26.727]  Not this easy way out saying, where's your birth certificate?
[03:04:26.727 --> 03:04:27.267]  Doesn't do it.
[03:04:27.267 --> 03:04:29.370]  So obamacrimes.com is the place to go.
[03:04:30.405 --> 03:04:31.085]  Absolutely.
[03:04:31.085 --> 03:04:32.206]  People should support you.
[03:04:32.206 --> 03:04:43.311]  You're doing invaluable work, and I want to have you on next week for an hour or more with the colonel who you're representing, and to cover a lot more at obamacrimes.com.
[03:04:43.311 --> 03:04:50.394]  Mr. Berg, thank you so much for spending time with us, and I'm going to have my producer call you in about 20 minutes to lock down that interview time.
[03:04:52.639 --> 03:04:53.479]  Yvette, take care.
[03:04:53.479 --> 03:04:57.521]  Our website's InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:57.521 --> 03:05:00.022]  We have another guest coming up, Reverend James Manning.
[03:05:00.022 --> 03:05:01.042]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.042 --> 03:05:02.423]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.423 --> 03:05:04.424]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:05:04.424 --> 03:05:05.404]  Well, you should.
[03:05:05.404 --> 03:05:09.886]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:05:09.886 --> 03:05:10.346]  That's right.
[03:05:10.686 --> 03:05:20.713]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[03:05:20.713 --> 03:05:27.698]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:05:28.038 --> 03:05:34.942]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[03:05:34.942 --> 03:05:40.464]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[03:05:40.464 --> 03:05:41.925]  This is real.
[03:05:41.925 --> 03:05:42.986]  Don't miss out.
[03:05:42.986 --> 03:05:51.550]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[03:06:01.436 --> 03:06:02.077]  Hello, friends.
[03:06:02.077 --> 03:06:03.137]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:06:03.137 --> 03:06:07.881]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:06:07.881 --> 03:06:10.843]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:06:10.843 --> 03:06:13.885]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:06:13.885 --> 03:06:19.729]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:06:19.949 --> 03:06:23.191]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:06:23.191 --> 03:06:30.176]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:06:30.176 --> 03:06:33.458]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:06:33.458 --> 03:06:35.339]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[03:06:38.601 --> 03:06:44.868]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:06:44.868 --> 03:06:48.653]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:48.653 --> 03:06:49.994]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:06:49.994 --> 03:06:50.515]  Take action today.
[03:06:50.515 --> 03:06:51.876]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:07:01.479 --> 03:07:05.820]  Guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:07:05.820 --> 03:07:08.380]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:07:08.380 --> 03:07:18.062]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:07:18.062 --> 03:07:24.263]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[03:07:24.263 --> 03:07:26.963]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[03:07:26.963 --> 03:07:29.344]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[03:07:30.484 --> 03:07:30.824]  I think so.
[03:07:53.186 --> 03:07:54.648]  OwnMyself.com.
[03:07:54.648 --> 03:07:58.434]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[03:07:58.434 --> 03:08:01.598]  Remember, Chocolate.OwnMyself.com.
[03:08:01.598 --> 03:08:07.026]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.026 --> 03:08:09.310]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:20.788 --> 03:08:23.690]  Well, it's ATLAH Worldwide!
[03:08:23.690 --> 03:08:28.294]  And he has millions of people that listen to his sermons and watch what he has to do.
[03:08:28.294 --> 03:08:30.336]  He's a very popular pastor.
[03:08:30.336 --> 03:08:35.240]  Reverend James Manning is Chief Pastor at ATLAH World Missionary Church.
[03:08:35.240 --> 03:08:45.569]  Manning graduated from the College of New Rochelle with a Bachelor of Arts degree and continued to the Union Theological Seminary in the city of New York where he is awarded Master of Divinity.
[03:08:45.569 --> 03:08:47.671]  Manning also holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree.
[03:08:48.711 --> 03:09:03.117]  From Theology Seminary and unaccredited educational institution, Manning achieved some controversy in the 2008 presidential election after he posted several sermons of his that were harshly critical of Democratic candidate Barack Obama on the website YouTube.
[03:09:03.117 --> 03:09:08.679]  So that's kind of the view of him from Wikipedia, but you never know about Wikipedia.
[03:09:08.679 --> 03:09:12.521]  They got my name spelled wrong and half the stuff on there is a lie about me.
[03:09:12.521 --> 03:09:17.123]  So we have the man himself who I think is very focused, articulate, and also very angry
[03:09:18.470 --> 03:09:22.895]  In fact, early on he was really critical of Obama, and I wasn't sure about Obama.
[03:09:22.895 --> 03:09:32.226]  You know, I wasn't a big fan of Bush, and a lot of stuff Obama said he wanted to do, I agreed with, but then he's lied about everything, and now his approval rating's gone from 84
[03:09:33.968 --> 03:09:36.230]  in a Rasmussen poll to 49.
[03:09:36.230 --> 03:09:38.512]  Nobody's has ever fallen that fast.
[03:09:38.512 --> 03:09:42.895]  Now it's coming out that the majority of people think he was really born in Kenya.
[03:09:42.895 --> 03:09:43.956]  He's such a liar.
[03:09:43.956 --> 03:09:45.037]  Who knows if that's true?
[03:09:45.037 --> 03:09:46.918]  We just covered it with Mr. Berg earlier.
[03:09:46.918 --> 03:09:49.420]  They won't release the original birth certificate.
[03:09:49.420 --> 03:09:52.283]  Anybody who criticizes him gets called a racist.
[03:09:52.283 --> 03:09:55.865]  It's creating all this racial division.
[03:09:55.865 --> 03:09:58.968]  And this is getting really scary.
[03:09:58.968 --> 03:09:59.849]  So I wanted to get
[03:10:01.045 --> 03:10:01.365]  I think?
[03:10:17.473 --> 03:10:27.721]  And as I said, when Obama first got elected, I said, I feel bad because when it turns out that this guy is a fraud like most politicians, it's going to be turned into a racial issue.
[03:10:27.721 --> 03:10:32.785]  So to give us his take on this is a fellow who's ended up being all over Fox, CNN, you name it.
[03:10:32.785 --> 03:10:35.548]  Quite a big controversy.
[03:10:35.548 --> 03:10:38.370]  Dr. James David Manning.
[03:10:38.370 --> 03:10:40.672]  Pastor, it's good to have you on here with us, sir.
[03:10:41.715 --> 03:10:45.057]  Well, Alex, it's good to be here as well.
[03:10:45.057 --> 03:10:48.379]  I'm really honored to be on your broadcast.
[03:10:48.379 --> 03:10:54.123]  I've heard a lot about you, and I've seen what they've done to you on YouTube.
[03:10:54.123 --> 03:10:58.486]  I've heard all about it, but I'm glad to be on the broadcast today.
[03:10:58.486 --> 03:10:59.787]  Let me also add this.
[03:10:59.787 --> 03:11:09.213]  I am traveling, and I'm not in my office, and so I had to stop at a restaurant to make this call, so you may hear some exterior noises.
[03:11:09.733 --> 03:11:10.694]  I totally understand.
[03:11:10.694 --> 03:11:12.776]  You're on the road, came on on short notice.
[03:11:12.776 --> 03:11:15.338]  We'll have you back up from the studio in the near future.
[03:11:15.338 --> 03:11:17.601]  You've got the floor, sir.
[03:11:17.601 --> 03:11:21.764]  Well, again, you know, your intro kind of says it all.
[03:11:21.764 --> 03:11:32.414]  I was very much aware of Obama from day one, if you will, checking out him as a person, what his spirit was all about.
[03:11:34.022 --> 03:11:35.423]  And was David able to deal with that?
[03:11:35.423 --> 03:11:43.145]  But I first began to try to deal with the African-American or black community, whatever it is that, you know, black folks prefer to be called.
[03:11:43.145 --> 03:11:59.930]  After I realized who he was and that the presidential campaign was underway, I tried to say to the black folk, especially since the church, the Lord has let me pastor for the last 27 years in Harlem, New York,
[03:12:02.592 --> 03:12:14.851]  And of course, black folk have been so enamored with Bill Clinton and labeled him, uh, Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou, and stated that he was the first black president.
[03:12:14.851 --> 03:12:17.476]  No black president could ever be better than Bill Clinton.
[03:12:18.272 --> 03:12:32.795]  And then, of course, back in 2001, the Black Caucus, Congressional Caucus of the Black Congress, got together and put together a resolution there in the House determining that Bill Clinton was the first black president.
[03:12:32.795 --> 03:12:38.776]  And then I saw them turning from their commitment to the Clintons to Obama.
[03:12:38.776 --> 03:12:41.316]  And I am not a Clinton supporter.
[03:12:41.316 --> 03:12:45.437]  I was very much against Clinton, but in the entire eight years he was in office,
[03:12:46.077 --> 03:12:49.599]  People just didn't pick up on me the way they did with Obama.
[03:12:49.599 --> 03:13:03.546]  But I was trying to say to the black people in Harlem and nationwide that it represented a sense of absence of loyalty, the absence of integrity, and it just kind of mushroomed from there as I began to watch the campaign unfold.
[03:13:04.189 --> 03:13:14.452]  Well, atlah.org, A-T-L-A-H dot O-R-G is the website where folks can actually watch and listen to the unedited sermons.
[03:13:14.452 --> 03:13:20.934]  The mainstream media has taken out of context and kind of boiled down and misrepresented some of what you've said.
[03:13:20.934 --> 03:13:29.536]  Here in your own words, sir, because it's got international attention, what is your basic take on Obama, what he's done, where this is going?
[03:13:30.396 --> 03:13:40.499]  I found sermons of you nine, ten, eleven months ago saying this is going to end in disaster, when the media was acting like Jesus had returned and we were all saved.
[03:13:40.499 --> 03:13:46.601]  How did you instinctively, or I guess spiritually, or from research, know this was going to end so bad?
[03:13:46.601 --> 03:13:53.383]  Because it really is, I'm following the trajectory, he is falling like a shooting star right now.
[03:13:53.383 --> 03:13:57.104]  Well, I was spiritually aware of him, Alex.
[03:13:58.254 --> 03:13:59.915]  Early on.
[03:13:59.915 --> 03:14:16.067]  Biblically, from the time I was a young boy growing up down in North Carolina, hearing the preachers preach about one that was going to come and would purport to solve all the world's problems.
[03:14:16.787 --> 03:14:32.679]  And that the world would be so enamored and in love with him that they would indeed worship him, and that he would be extremely charismatic, that he would be, you know, he would be handsome, and the whole world would bow down before him.
[03:14:32.679 --> 03:14:44.889]  I heard these sermons preached years ago when I was just a boy, and when Obama came, I realized that he fit the bill of the sermons that have been preached.
[03:14:45.969 --> 03:14:55.052]  Uh, early, years early, by preachers who had no idea who this person would be, what race they would come from, or even what period in which he would show up.
[03:14:55.052 --> 03:14:59.113]  Now, are you saying he's a prototype, as the Bible says, mini-Antichrist spirit?
[03:14:59.113 --> 03:15:00.514]  Or are you saying he could be the big one?
[03:15:01.311 --> 03:15:02.772]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[03:15:02.772 --> 03:15:06.533]  That is exactly what I'm saying.
[03:15:06.533 --> 03:15:20.439]  And while you're right about his following the trajectory of Obama's rise and fall, he has fallen in points over the last couple of weeks, more specifically.
[03:15:20.439 --> 03:15:23.821]  But Alex, I'll say this to you, and be well advised.
[03:15:24.935 --> 03:15:25.376]  That's right.
[03:15:35.979 --> 03:15:41.561]  But you're saying he can certainly pull some rabbits out of hats and stage some crises.
[03:15:41.561 --> 03:15:44.002]  So where do you see this going with Obama?
[03:15:44.002 --> 03:15:45.082]  What's the bottom line?
[03:16:01.973 --> 03:16:08.436]  I see it going into a revolution or a civil war in America.
[03:16:08.436 --> 03:16:10.877]  That's exactly what's on the agenda.
[03:16:10.877 --> 03:16:13.058]  And that's the only thing that's going to get our nation back.
[03:16:13.058 --> 03:16:17.180]  You are not going to get this nation back from Obama through the vote.
[03:16:17.180 --> 03:16:18.460]  I can tell you that now.
[03:16:18.460 --> 03:16:24.803]  Through putting in Congresspersons, putting in Senators, and rearranging the House in 2010.
[03:16:24.803 --> 03:16:28.025]  You're not going to take this nation back from Obama.
[03:16:28.025 --> 03:16:30.866]  He has deeply implanted inside
[03:16:36.288 --> 03:16:50.735]  Well, that's the thing, is that he is federally seizing giant corporations, having Homeland Security take over all the federal agencies.
[03:16:50.735 --> 03:16:56.618]  He really is grabbing control of everything, so even if people wake up, it won't matter.
[03:16:56.618 --> 03:17:00.320]  So you're saying he's going to attempt to set up a dictatorship?
[03:17:01.158 --> 03:17:08.121]  The only thing that he has not done yet, he has done, we've seen the seizing of General Motors, he wants health care.
[03:17:08.121 --> 03:17:16.266]  Now, if he can get health care, one-sixth of the American economy, and then he controls everybody's lives.
[03:17:16.266 --> 03:17:28.892]  Senator Orrin had said the other day, in the Senate Finance Committee, when they were trying to put together a bill to present to Obama, the long-legged back-daddy, that's what I call him, that he was so ticked off
[03:17:29.512 --> 03:17:34.816]  With what they were strategizing to do there in that Senate Finance Committee, he walked out of there.
[03:17:34.816 --> 03:17:43.941]  And what he said, and it did not mince his words, what he said was that they were really trying to propose a plan that would be a government takeover.
[03:17:43.941 --> 03:17:49.165]  They're not looking just for healthcare for the 46 million people that don't have healthcare.
[03:17:50.606 --> 03:17:56.613]  Obama wants a complete government takeover of the entire healthcare industry.
[03:17:56.613 --> 03:17:59.336]  At that point he says who lives, who dies.
[03:17:59.336 --> 03:18:04.341]  Well look at the cap and trade where the feds can take over any business or even private home.
[03:18:04.341 --> 03:18:07.685]  That's in the bill and then Obama lies and says it isn't in there.
[03:18:07.685 --> 03:18:09.447]  I mean this is crazy.
[03:18:10.029 --> 03:18:25.402]  Well, if you give him cap and trade, where he controls the energy, he can control any business, walk into any business, shut it down at any time he wants, or funnel billions of federal dollars into any business he wants to funnel it into, how are you going to get him out by voting?
[03:18:25.402 --> 03:18:26.163]  You can't do that.
[03:18:26.163 --> 03:18:27.544]  I mean, he'll control everything.
[03:18:28.024 --> 03:18:44.192]  The only thing he hasn't started doing yet, which I suspect will happen in not too many days or months, will be the beginning of the arresting of people or people being pursued by IRS investigations or whatever.
[03:18:44.192 --> 03:18:45.193]  That's next on the horizon.
[03:18:45.293 --> 03:18:59.973]  Well, Pastor, actually, during the campaign, you probably know in Missouri and other states, they would go on the news and say, if you lie about him, and we're going to decide, no judge or jury, the police are going to arrest you, and now they're trying to pass the hate crimes law, where they arrest you for your speech!
[03:19:00.845 --> 03:19:02.146]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:19:02.146 --> 03:19:03.427]  That's next.
[03:19:03.427 --> 03:19:06.268]  That's one of the things I'm concerned about.
[03:19:06.268 --> 03:19:13.633]  You know, as I preach and speak, I mean, I'm a prime candidate to be hauled off to jail.
[03:19:13.633 --> 03:19:18.736]  I mean, they kick my door in in the middle of the night and take me off the jail and nobody knows where I'm at.
[03:19:18.736 --> 03:19:20.197]  You know, that's coming.
[03:19:20.197 --> 03:19:26.801]  Listen, we cannot, anybody who thinks, if you're an American, you've been around American politics, you know, at the time, if you think
[03:19:27.481 --> 03:19:33.866]  That this nation is not headed for a confrontation revolution.
[03:19:33.866 --> 03:19:40.071]  If you think that this nation can be taken back from Obama with just voting him out, you've got another thing coming.
[03:19:40.071 --> 03:19:41.352]  I can't imagine where you've been.
[03:19:41.352 --> 03:19:48.998]  This has got to go to the American people rising up and saying, we're not taking this yet, we're going to take our nation back.
[03:19:50.589 --> 03:19:51.549]  All right.
[03:19:51.549 --> 03:19:53.210]  Pastor Manning, stay there.
[03:19:53.210 --> 03:19:54.510]  We've got a final segment with you.
[03:19:54.510 --> 03:19:58.071]  How you see this revolution unfolding.
[03:19:58.071 --> 03:19:58.831]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:58.831 --> 03:20:02.012]  Stay with us.
[03:20:02.012 --> 03:20:03.433]  It is a big idea.
[03:20:03.433 --> 03:20:06.253]  A new world order.
[03:20:06.253 --> 03:20:11.155]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:20:11.155 --> 03:20:13.976]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:20:13.976 --> 03:20:16.756]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:20:16.756 --> 03:20:19.157]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:20:19.933 --> 03:20:25.802]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:20:30.305 --> 03:20:35.749]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:20:35.749 --> 03:20:39.071]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:20:39.071 --> 03:20:42.173]  The Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:20:42.173 --> 03:20:43.354]  Most people have no idea.
[03:20:43.354 --> 03:20:44.134]  They're not after money.
[03:20:44.134 --> 03:20:45.415]  They have all the money they need.
[03:20:45.415 --> 03:20:46.396]  They're after power.
[03:20:46.396 --> 03:20:47.537]  That's their after-mission.

[03:21:01.146 --> 03:21:07.571]  Yeah.
[03:21:07.571 --> 03:21:19.320]  Aerial spraying, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.

[03:23:00.919 --> 03:23:08.044]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[03:23:08.044 --> 03:23:24.276]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[03:23:24.276 --> 03:23:29.400]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[03:23:29.620 --> 03:23:36.147]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[03:23:36.147 --> 03:23:40.031]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[03:23:40.031 --> 03:23:42.733]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[03:23:42.733 --> 03:23:48.099]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[03:23:48.399 --> 03:23:51.081]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:23:51.081 --> 03:23:53.302]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[03:23:53.302 --> 03:23:55.804]  That's MySolarBackup.com.

[03:24:00.167 --> 03:24:05.210]  Alright, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[03:24:05.210 --> 03:24:08.473]  We'll have Dr. Reverend James Manning up for a full hour in the near future.
[03:24:08.473 --> 03:24:09.353]  He's on the road today.
[03:24:12.583 --> 03:24:15.507]  Sir, you got the floor in the last five minutes of this segment, quick segment.
[03:24:15.507 --> 03:24:26.199]  We were talking intensely during the break about how he came from nowhere, all those points you made, now his actions, now the police state, and what you see happening in America.
[03:24:26.199 --> 03:24:26.560]  Go ahead.
[03:24:27.887 --> 03:24:45.738]  Obama's rise to power has never had a person, no one has ever in the history of this nation risen as quickly as Obama and has become the most powerful man in the world and we don't even know where he was born.
[03:24:45.738 --> 03:24:47.759]  We don't know where he was born.
[03:24:47.759 --> 03:24:49.840]  We don't know who his father is.
[03:24:49.840 --> 03:24:50.961]  We really don't know.
[03:24:50.961 --> 03:24:52.322]  Now we've gotten reports
[03:24:52.942 --> 03:24:57.925]  But this man, at present, is the most powerful man on this planet.
[03:24:57.925 --> 03:25:04.869]  And right now, I've stated, some time ago, that Hitler's power was nothing compared to Obama's power.
[03:25:04.869 --> 03:25:17.676]  Because Germany was not, as a powerful nation, during the time of the social democratic status of Germany and Hitler, America is a mega-nation.
[03:25:17.676 --> 03:25:20.818]  And Obama has all this, if Hitler had all this power,
[03:25:21.178 --> 03:25:23.560]  My God, the roof will be gone by now.
[03:25:23.560 --> 03:25:24.300]  10,000 nukes, yeah.
[03:25:24.300 --> 03:25:26.501]  Obama's got 10,000 nukes.
[03:25:26.501 --> 03:25:30.484]  There is nobody, there has never been a situation such as this.
[03:25:30.484 --> 03:25:34.186]  His birth certificate, whether he's a U.S.
[03:25:34.186 --> 03:25:37.408]  citizen or not, everybody knows that he isn't.
[03:25:37.408 --> 03:25:38.608]  Everybody knows that he isn't.
[03:25:38.608 --> 03:25:40.549]  That's another thing we'll have to talk about at another point.
[03:25:40.549 --> 03:25:47.093]  So are you saying early on in your spirit, because I know you did videos when he wasn't even... I mean, you were saying you were worried about him day one.
[03:25:47.093 --> 03:25:47.934]  Was that in your gut?
[03:25:50.833 --> 03:25:54.874]  What do you see happening in the future dealing with martial law and revolution?
[03:25:56.485 --> 03:25:59.626]  I want to say to your audience, Alex, I am not an alarmist.
[03:25:59.626 --> 03:26:01.347]  I am not some person.
[03:26:01.347 --> 03:26:04.168]  I'm not Chicken Little, the sky is falling.
[03:26:04.168 --> 03:26:06.748]  I pray that people don't perceive me that way.
[03:26:06.748 --> 03:26:08.789]  I've been a pastor for 27 years.
[03:26:08.789 --> 03:26:14.671]  I've served the Harlem community with the earnestness of my love and my love for Jesus.
[03:26:14.671 --> 03:26:22.854]  I'm preaching the gospel, but martial law, the arresting of people, the reason why all of these things are going to happen
[03:26:24.537 --> 03:26:36.363]  Many Americans across America are beginning to realize that we are facing, or we have at present, the most diabolical person sitting in the Oval Office.
[03:26:36.363 --> 03:26:42.766]  There are people in this nation who are going to rise up, and they're forming right now in small groups.
[03:26:43.567 --> 03:26:49.970]  All over America, they're listening and they're watching, and at some point you're going to see an uprising.
[03:26:49.970 --> 03:26:56.514]  In order to stop this, Obama will begin to arrest people, and under martial law,
[03:26:57.481 --> 03:27:11.136]  An event such as 9-11 or some other event here in America can give Obama sweeping powers to shut down the Constitution, to shut down all agencies, and arrest or imprison anybody he wants.
[03:27:11.136 --> 03:27:13.099]  Are you saying he may stage something?
[03:27:14.548 --> 03:27:25.214]  I'm saying it's possible if he feels that the matter of the American people is strong enough in resentment to begin to destroy him, to pull him down, I think that he will.
[03:27:25.214 --> 03:27:37.802]  And the other thing that we need to know that I have not said, and I'm saying this for the very first time on your broadcast, I don't mean to be self-promoting anything, as God gives it to me, I want to say it, is that we have not, Alex, we have not
[03:27:38.542 --> 03:27:49.772]  We have not really began to phantom how diabolical this man is, that if he sees himself going down, that he'll take the world down with him.
[03:27:49.772 --> 03:28:01.643]  Listen, we are looking at a narcissistic, we're looking at a man who is so, I suppose, hung up on himself, so diabolical, that he would not hesitate
[03:28:02.366 --> 03:28:02.606]  I think so.
[03:28:17.223 --> 03:28:40.872]  No, no, I understand, sir, and it looks like they're setting that up with the economic crisis, the staged flu, all this stuff is really concerning me, and it does look like revolutions in the air to all this, and it seems like they want people to rebel.
[03:28:40.872 --> 03:28:44.594]  It seems like they want... I mean, they're clearly going for broke right now.
[03:28:45.879 --> 03:28:57.382]  The thing that Obama, though in his brilliance, realizes, because he is maniacal and diabolical and insidious, is that he cannot deal with it.
[03:28:57.382 --> 03:29:01.283]  But the truth of the matter is, America is a great nation.
[03:29:01.283 --> 03:29:04.384]  It's a nation that God Almighty has blessed.
[03:29:04.904 --> 03:29:09.666]  And Americans are going to stand up again and put their lives on the line.
[03:29:09.666 --> 03:29:15.149]  And in order for him to deal with that, it's going to result in the things that we're discussing at present.
[03:29:15.149 --> 03:29:23.812]  But what I want to say in that statement is that this is a strong nation and it's going to rise up against Obama.
[03:29:23.812 --> 03:29:26.554]  Alright, well God bless you Dr. James Manning.
[03:29:26.554 --> 03:29:31.776]  atlah.org, A-T-L-A-H dot O-R-G, or just Google.
[03:29:33.257 --> 03:29:35.578]  James David Manning, and you will find it.
[03:29:35.578 --> 03:29:39.699]  We'll talk to you for a full hour when you get back off the road, back to Harlem.
[03:29:39.699 --> 03:29:42.079]  God bless you, sir, and it was good speaking with you.
[03:29:42.079 --> 03:29:42.659]  God bless you.
[03:29:42.659 --> 03:29:44.180]  I was honored to be on your show.
[03:29:44.180 --> 03:29:45.720]  Thank you so very much for having me.
[03:29:45.720 --> 03:29:46.560]  Honored to have you.
[03:29:46.560 --> 03:29:49.661]  I just am attracted to the pastor's spirit.
[03:29:49.661 --> 03:29:51.801]  Just a good guy.
[03:29:51.801 --> 03:29:53.202]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.202 --> 03:29:55.722]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.722 --> 03:29:58.403]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.212 --> 03:30:06.519]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.519 --> 03:30:11.065]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:11.065 --> 03:30:13.328]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.328 --> 03:30:14.950]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:15.992]  There is a solution.

[03:31:01.274 --> 03:31:05.497]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:31:05.497 --> 03:31:07.519]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:31:07.519 --> 03:31:16.025]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:31:16.025 --> 03:31:21.589]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:31:21.589 --> 03:31:23.210]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:31:23.430 --> 03:31:29.952]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:31:29.952 --> 03:31:40.997]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[03:31:40.997 --> 03:31:41.777]  That's right.
[03:31:41.777 --> 03:31:44.338]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:31:44.338 --> 03:31:46.118]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-HELP.
[03:31:47.859 --> 03:31:48.520]  We're good to go.
[03:32:01.792 --> 03:32:02.473]  You worry.
[03:32:02.473 --> 03:32:04.816]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[03:32:04.816 --> 03:32:05.377]  Hi.
[03:32:05.377 --> 03:32:08.161]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[03:32:08.161 --> 03:32:12.708]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[03:32:12.708 --> 03:32:15.191]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[03:32:15.191 --> 03:32:18.216]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[03:32:18.516 --> 03:32:20.457]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[03:32:20.457 --> 03:32:23.239]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[03:32:23.239 --> 03:32:26.962]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[03:32:26.962 --> 03:32:31.385]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[03:32:31.385 --> 03:32:35.467]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[03:32:35.467 --> 03:32:41.812]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[03:32:41.812 --> 03:32:44.173]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[03:32:44.173 --> 03:32:46.275]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[03:32:46.275 --> 03:32:48.236]  So go to offthefield.com or call
[03:32:48.336 --> 03:32:51.837]  888-51-EAT-FREE Start now.
[03:32:51.837 --> 03:32:53.537]  Knowledge is power.
[03:32:53.537 --> 03:32:54.557]  Better take action.
[03:32:54.557 --> 03:32:55.598]  I think a storm's coming.
[03:32:55.598 --> 03:33:06.300]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side
[03:33:19.176 --> 03:33:25.682]  You know, I asked Willie Nelson, what's your favorite song you've ever sung?
[03:33:25.682 --> 03:33:27.944]  He said, this one right here.
[03:33:27.944 --> 03:33:29.626]  And this is my favorite.
[03:33:29.626 --> 03:33:30.006]  Good stuff.
[03:33:42.759 --> 03:33:45.420]  What's funny, Hartman?
[03:33:45.420 --> 03:33:49.562]  Oh, I mean, it's like Joker fell in there.
[03:33:49.562 --> 03:33:50.623]  It's Jared Neumar.
[03:33:50.623 --> 03:33:52.284]  He's also a comedian.
[03:33:52.284 --> 03:33:53.764]  He has his night job.
[03:33:53.764 --> 03:34:00.828]  So there's like an endless comedian thing for the class.
[03:34:00.828 --> 03:34:04.149]  That's Chris Christopherson coming up for Ellen Jennings.
[03:34:04.149 --> 03:34:04.970]  That part's really good.
[03:34:06.004 --> 03:34:07.245]  Crank them Waylon James.
[03:34:07.245 --> 03:34:11.208]  And then we'll go ahead and let you hear Mr. Cash.
[03:34:11.208 --> 03:34:14.491]  Then I'm going to your phone calls and a bunch of other news.
[03:34:14.491 --> 03:34:15.972]  Stay with us.
[03:34:15.972 --> 03:34:18.354]  I was a dam builder.
[03:34:18.354 --> 03:34:19.555]  I was a dam builder.
[03:34:19.555 --> 03:34:23.078]  Across the slim, empty, deep end of the wild.
[03:34:23.078 --> 03:34:26.441]  Where steel and water didn't collide.
[03:34:26.441 --> 03:34:30.004]  A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.
[03:34:30.004 --> 03:34:32.806]  A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.
[03:34:35.925 --> 03:34:39.467]  I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below.
[03:34:39.467 --> 03:34:44.370]  That's where Jared's going, in the wet concrete below.
[03:34:44.370 --> 03:34:48.993]  They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound.
[03:34:48.993 --> 03:34:51.454]  But I'm still around.
[03:34:51.454 --> 03:34:56.317]  I'll always be around, and around, and around, and around.
[03:34:56.317 --> 03:34:59.879]  Ah, here's Johnny Cash from the grave, forever.
[03:34:59.879 --> 03:35:03.001]  Bless Johnny Cash, Michael Fox, and bless John Wayne.
[03:35:05.550 --> 03:35:12.473]  I'll fly a starship across the universe divide.
[03:35:12.473 --> 03:35:21.658]  And when I reach the other side, I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can.
[03:35:21.658 --> 03:35:22.918]  Good stuff.
[03:35:22.918 --> 03:35:26.220]  Perhaps I may become a highwayman again.
[03:35:28.747 --> 03:35:29.848]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[03:35:29.848 --> 03:35:32.550]  Now I'm going to blitz the news to the very end.
[03:35:32.550 --> 03:35:35.132]  Ron in Arizona, you are on the air.
[03:35:35.132 --> 03:35:36.793]  Welcome.
[03:35:36.793 --> 03:35:38.674]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[03:35:38.674 --> 03:35:39.775]  Hey, buddy.
[03:35:39.775 --> 03:35:41.316]  Two quick points.
[03:35:41.316 --> 03:35:52.564]  First, I'd like to say that Pastor Manning is correct that Barry Sotero is a type of the Antichrist, but he cannot be the Antichrist because he's way too old.
[03:35:52.564 --> 03:35:54.325]  When the Antichrist rises, the power
[03:35:55.134 --> 03:36:05.740]  He'll be in his 30s, he'll come out of Iraq, he'll be the ruler of Iraq, and the Antichrist will not rise to power for at least another 20 years.
[03:36:05.740 --> 03:36:22.769]  That stuff can be debated, it's a secular show, Manning's just been all over CNN, Fox, you name it, and then we talked to him, it turned out they're Ministries fans of the show, and so I just wanted, as a prominent black preacher, who's not worshipping Barack Obama, to get his perspective on Barack Obama.
[03:36:26.004 --> 03:36:27.345]  But you have a good point there, Ron.
[03:36:27.345 --> 03:36:29.006]  Anything else?
[03:36:29.006 --> 03:36:34.849]  Yeah, I recently wrote a book explaining this and the New World Order and all that.
[03:36:34.849 --> 03:36:50.238]  But the second thing is, I think when you talk about Barry Sotero and his birth certificate, where he was born, if you could bring up the fact that it doesn't matter because he is not the President of the United States of America.
[03:36:50.238 --> 03:36:50.298]  In 1861,
[03:36:53.154 --> 03:36:58.960]  When the southern congressmen and senators walked out, the union was dissolved.
[03:36:58.960 --> 03:37:15.115]  No, but sir, I understand all... Listen, I appreciate your call, but filing straw men and saying that it's a corrupt republic and that the District of Columbia... All of that is based in reality, but the system just ignores it.
[03:37:15.115 --> 03:37:15.896]  So, yes.
[03:37:19.446 --> 03:37:24.508]  You can say that the federal government was a tyranny since the Civil War, but it's here with us now.
[03:37:24.508 --> 03:37:26.629]  So we gotta try to audit the Fed.
[03:37:26.629 --> 03:37:28.730]  We don't just have a problem with the federal government.
[03:37:28.730 --> 03:37:32.172]  The federal government's got global bankers sitting on top of it.
[03:37:32.172 --> 03:37:34.713]  Then here's the federal government, the state government's and us.
[03:37:34.713 --> 03:37:40.816]  We gotta get the bankers off the top of the pyramid first before we cut the federal government down to size.
[03:37:40.816 --> 03:37:42.177]  Up there pulling the levers and
[03:37:42.697 --> 03:37:49.860]  Flipping the dials and running the system, the technocracy, is offshore banking cartels.
[03:37:49.860 --> 03:37:52.101]  We've had a corporate takeover.
[03:37:52.101 --> 03:37:57.103]  And so, we've got to get the bankers out of here first, then we can debate all this other stuff.
[03:37:57.103 --> 03:37:57.803]  But I hear you, Ron.
[03:37:57.803 --> 03:37:58.603]  Good points there.
[03:37:58.603 --> 03:37:59.684]  Daniel in Oklahoma.
[03:37:59.684 --> 03:38:00.564]  Daniel, you're on the air.
[03:38:00.564 --> 03:38:01.724]  Go ahead.
[03:38:01.724 --> 03:38:02.945]  Good afternoon, sir.
[03:38:02.945 --> 03:38:11.308]  I had a kind of a request, because I've been hearing a lot, doing a lot of research on the legitimacy of his presidency, Obama's.
[03:38:11.943 --> 03:38:26.126]  And, uh, I've actually heard on, uh, more than one case that they removed a video from YouTube and all the Internet of Barack Obama actually admitting that he wasn't eligible to be the President of the United States.
[03:38:26.126 --> 03:38:36.609]  And this was, uh, when Alan Keyes, when he was, uh, doing his campaign for, for running for the Senate, he actually, uh, Alan Keyes confronted him backstage.
[03:38:37.102 --> 03:38:38.983]  And said, hey, what are you doing this for?
[03:38:38.983 --> 03:38:39.784]  You're not eligible.
[03:38:39.784 --> 03:38:41.245]  And he said, well, what does it matter?
[03:38:41.245 --> 03:38:44.787]  I'm not running for the President of the United States.
[03:38:44.787 --> 03:38:50.130]  Well, you know, there's one big problem with that rumor, and I've heard it, and I appreciate your call, Daniel.
[03:38:50.130 --> 03:38:51.651]  And it's okay to bring the point up.
[03:38:51.651 --> 03:38:53.852]  I mean, it's a good question to ask.
[03:38:53.852 --> 03:38:56.514]  Alan Keyes would be running around talking about this.
[03:38:56.514 --> 03:38:59.235]  Alan Keyes hates Barack Obama.
[03:38:59.235 --> 03:39:04.619]  Ambassador Alan Keyes.
[03:39:04.619 --> 03:39:04.879]  So...
[03:39:06.667 --> 03:39:09.648]  There's your issue right there.
[03:39:09.648 --> 03:39:23.194]  I mean, I always hear about, I get calls every week, on and off air about, my cousin knows a guy who works at a repair shop who saw a checkpoint where a truck dumped over full of martial law signs.
[03:39:23.194 --> 03:39:24.055]  I've been hearing that for 14 years.
[03:39:25.473 --> 03:39:39.143]  I've got mainstream news, martial law preparations, foreign troops training for gun confiscations and take on the American people, FEMA press releases, NLE09 we're going to be covering all week, and I can't get people to pay attention to it.
[03:39:41.680 --> 03:39:44.821]  The so-called swine flu is clearly manufactured.
[03:39:44.821 --> 03:39:48.182]  Baxter and others put in patents for it a year before it popped up.
[03:39:48.182 --> 03:39:51.123]  They're building mass graves, getting ready for martial law.
[03:39:51.123 --> 03:39:54.364]  I gave you secret documents before it was mainstream news.
[03:39:54.364 --> 03:39:57.084]  Now it's mainstream news.
[03:39:57.084 --> 03:40:01.806]  It's still not that big of an issue.
[03:40:01.806 --> 03:40:02.666]  All I'm saying is,
[03:40:03.877 --> 03:40:06.740]  Obama could clear all this up by releasing his birth certificate.
[03:40:06.740 --> 03:40:08.741]  And don't give me, he has.
[03:40:08.741 --> 03:40:11.704]  No, he hasn't.
[03:40:11.704 --> 03:40:17.009]  He hasn't released, he's released a certificate.
[03:40:17.009 --> 03:40:19.271]  And now they've waited so long they could fake one.
[03:40:19.271 --> 03:40:24.896]  I mean, they really, why did, it's getting very, why did he post his birth certificate before anybody was asking the question?
[03:40:24.896 --> 03:40:26.918]  Or his certificate of birth certificate.
[03:40:26.918 --> 03:40:28.079]  Certificate of live birth.
[03:40:29.088 --> 03:40:29.688]  Oh, God.
[03:40:29.688 --> 03:40:30.789]  Robert in Texas.
[03:40:30.789 --> 03:40:31.689]  Robert, you're on the air.
[03:40:31.689 --> 03:40:32.129]  Go ahead.
[03:40:32.129 --> 03:40:33.809]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:40:33.809 --> 03:40:36.210]  Good, sir.
[03:40:36.210 --> 03:40:37.330]  I was broadcasting.
[03:40:37.330 --> 03:40:48.173]  I was on the air last night talking about NLE 09, warning people about the, you know, the foreign troops coming over here.
[03:40:48.173 --> 03:40:55.295]  And I had a listener come in the chat room, posted a link to the FEMA website, and said, where does it say anything about foreign troops?
[03:40:55.295 --> 03:40:57.536]  And I said, it's right there in paragraph three.
[03:40:58.809 --> 03:41:02.910]  So I went back to the FEMA site and it was gone.
[03:41:02.910 --> 03:41:08.191]  At the bottom of the site it says last edited on July 24th.
[03:41:08.191 --> 03:41:09.471]  Well let's check into this.
[03:41:09.471 --> 03:41:15.693]  The top link when you put in National Level Exercise 2009 is a FEMA link.
[03:41:15.693 --> 03:41:20.374]  And I printed this again last night.
[03:41:20.374 --> 03:41:23.374]  And the guys printed some more on this today.
[03:41:23.374 --> 03:41:24.754]  National Level Exercise 2009.
[03:41:24.754 --> 03:41:25.095]  And it says
[03:41:28.353 --> 03:41:42.040]  That they're working with federal agencies, state, tribal, and the United States welcomes the participation of Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and NLE09.
[03:41:42.040 --> 03:41:52.325]  Then you get into the exercise, which is for counterintelligence, spying on us, foreign governments helping, and practicing, quote, taking on terrorists in the United States.
[03:41:52.325 --> 03:41:54.566]  And then here is the press release from FEMA,
[03:41:55.728 --> 03:42:00.692]  FEMA, Israeli Defense Forces, Home Front Command Partner for Martial Law.
[03:42:00.692 --> 03:42:14.123]  And when you go read this, and it's also in newspapers, they say the Israelis, because they know how to lock down a city, set up checkpoints, they're training all the major police departments on how to set up checkpoints and basically turn us into Gaza.
[03:42:14.123 --> 03:42:20.668]  And whether you love Israel or hate Israel, I sure don't want America to be like Israel, a total police state.
[03:42:20.668 --> 03:42:24.311]  But, you know, there's the FEMA official document.
[03:42:24.311 --> 03:42:25.232]  Guys, pull up FEMA.
[03:42:26.735 --> 03:42:31.719]  Just put into Google on screen right now for everybody, National Level Exercise 2009.
[03:42:31.719 --> 03:42:34.161]  Oh, there it is!
[03:42:34.161 --> 03:42:37.704]  It still says, I mean, there it is on screen right here.
[03:42:37.704 --> 03:42:40.847]  Post that on screen for folks watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:42:40.847 --> 03:42:51.276]  For folks on the radio, just Google National Level Exercise NLE09, the first Lynx FEMA press release that was put out a few months ago.
[03:42:52.834 --> 03:42:56.398]  And third paragraph says foreign troops right there.
[03:42:56.398 --> 03:42:59.782]  So, sir, I don't know what FEMA sheet you're looking at.
[03:42:59.782 --> 03:43:01.484]  Well, no, I'm looking at the same one you are.
[03:43:01.484 --> 03:43:04.307]  The last sentence was missing last night.
[03:43:04.307 --> 03:43:05.128]  It's back now.
[03:43:05.128 --> 03:43:06.330]  I'm looking at it right now.
[03:43:06.330 --> 03:43:07.291]  It's there.
[03:43:07.291 --> 03:43:12.076]  But if you also look at the bottom of the site, you see where they've been editing the site also.
[03:43:13.331 --> 03:43:17.853]  That's his last modified, yeah, Friday, July 24th.
[03:43:17.853 --> 03:43:19.113]  So you're right.
[03:43:19.113 --> 03:43:21.314]  Yeah, they've been in there changing things.
[03:43:21.314 --> 03:43:22.635]  They've been changing things.
[03:43:22.635 --> 03:43:24.836]  So that last sentence was not there last night.
[03:43:24.836 --> 03:43:36.801]  It is back today, which makes me believe that you're getting the word out and mainstream might be picking up on the foreign troops, so they had to put it back.
[03:43:37.455 --> 03:44:01.833]  Well, I mean, I remember two months ago, they had drills in Tucson and Phoenix with Israeli, German, French, Dutch, Australian, British, and a bunch of other, and it said, in-fighting terrorists, and I, the local news said, practicing to fight American militias, and I've got Army reports all over the country, in fact, I showed one in the first hour today, I'll dig it out in a minute,
[03:44:02.353 --> 03:44:05.214]  This is all going on and the public's in denial.
[03:44:05.214 --> 03:44:07.535]  Folks, we're not making this up.
[03:44:07.535 --> 03:44:08.835]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[03:44:08.835 --> 03:44:16.178]  In fact, guys, pull up the Curt Nemo story, FEMA, Israeli Defense Forces, Home Front Command Partner.
[03:44:16.178 --> 03:44:20.680]  FEMA, Israeli Defense Forces, Home Front Command Partner for Martial Law.
[03:44:20.680 --> 03:44:29.923]  Because I want to put this on screen, not just Curt Nemo's article, the whole article is hyperlinks to the Department of Homeland Security and to a FEMA press release.
[03:44:31.024 --> 03:44:32.005]  See right here?
[03:44:32.005 --> 03:44:32.905]  Zoom in.
[03:44:32.905 --> 03:44:36.228]  See, people say, oh, that's just InfoWars or Prison Planet.
[03:44:36.228 --> 03:44:39.690]  We are a hundred times better than the mainstream media.
[03:44:39.690 --> 03:44:41.791]  We link to everything we show.
[03:44:41.791 --> 03:44:43.613]  People ask, well, where do you get your info?
[03:44:43.613 --> 03:44:45.534]  FEMA.gov?
[03:44:45.534 --> 03:44:46.595]  Homeland Security?
[03:44:46.595 --> 03:44:48.756]  I mean, look, right there!
[03:44:48.756 --> 03:44:51.158]  Israeli troops!
[03:44:51.158 --> 03:44:52.339]  That's the press release link.
[03:44:53.703 --> 03:45:01.363]  In fact, go ahead and put the actual website up on screen and on video for everybody watching and listening, click on press release.
[03:45:03.223 --> 03:45:04.304]  See the first link?
[03:45:04.304 --> 03:45:06.585]  And there is the press release.
[03:45:06.585 --> 03:45:12.188]  FEMA Administrator Fugate meets top Israeli officials to discuss emergency management issues.
[03:45:12.188 --> 03:45:15.851]  And you read the article, it says they're involved in these drills.
[03:45:15.851 --> 03:45:19.933]  Then we googled that and found it was in Arizona.
[03:45:19.933 --> 03:45:28.558]  I go on air, read mainstream articles, but Arizona's saying how great it is to have foreign troops there, and how great it is to have them training to take on terrorists.
[03:45:28.558 --> 03:45:28.859]  And then,
[03:45:30.151 --> 03:45:31.531]  Look, I've got hundreds of these.
[03:45:31.531 --> 03:45:32.812]  I can't keep track of it.
[03:45:32.812 --> 03:45:34.452]  Here's News Tribune.
[03:45:34.452 --> 03:45:36.493]  Guard units trained for attacks.
[03:45:36.493 --> 03:45:38.273]  Camp Crowder, Missouri.
[03:45:38.273 --> 03:45:46.456]  And it says they practice repulsing an attack on the base by militias and on army checkpoint searching citizens.
[03:45:46.456 --> 03:45:52.157]  And they have army out on highways at mock checkpoints, which always go live.
[03:45:52.157 --> 03:45:52.957]  I videotaped this.
[03:45:52.957 --> 03:45:54.118]  I've been there before.
[03:45:54.118 --> 03:45:56.858]  And others have sent us the video.
[03:45:56.858 --> 03:45:58.279]  And it's got the militias
[03:45:59.428 --> 03:46:02.049]  They're practicing attacking the troops.
[03:46:02.049 --> 03:46:07.310]  It says malicious.
[03:46:07.310 --> 03:46:11.012]  I mean, you can go read this for yourself.
[03:46:11.012 --> 03:46:11.952]  They are practicing.
[03:46:11.952 --> 03:46:17.774]  I mean, Google Pentagon prepares to deploy in the U.S.
[03:46:17.774 --> 03:46:19.794]  or Brigade Homeland Tour.
[03:46:19.794 --> 03:46:25.216]  Google that and you'll be on Army Times saying they're preparing to put regular Army
[03:46:26.229 --> 03:46:29.832]  Two months ago, Tennessee, I had the state rep on.
[03:46:29.832 --> 03:46:34.597]  The army was out randomly running checkpoints in a four-state area.
[03:46:34.597 --> 03:46:38.520]  Tennessee was the only state to say no, and they told the governor, we're going to do it anyways.
[03:46:38.520 --> 03:46:39.841]  This was in the news!
[03:46:39.841 --> 03:46:42.103]  This is happening!
[03:46:42.103 --> 03:46:49.730]  And they just acclimate and acclimate and acclimate and acclimate and acclimate, and then we say something and they make fun of us.
[03:46:49.730 --> 03:46:50.431]  You know, I watched
[03:46:51.567 --> 03:46:53.148]  Real time with Bill Maher this weekend.
[03:46:53.148 --> 03:46:55.028]  I haven't watched it in months.
[03:46:55.028 --> 03:46:57.489]  And it was all lies.
[03:46:57.489 --> 03:47:00.190]  Just, just, and making fun of anybody that talks about this.
[03:47:00.190 --> 03:47:02.391]  And if you don't like Obama, you're a racist.
[03:47:02.391 --> 03:47:05.432]  I get these hundreds of emails a week saying, you're a racist, you're a racist.
[03:47:05.432 --> 03:47:09.273]  Folks, I'm not the one setting up abortuaries in black neighborhoods.
[03:47:09.273 --> 03:47:14.415]  I'm not the one grabbing black foster kids to test chemical and biologicals on them and radiologicals.
[03:47:14.415 --> 03:47:16.836]  And if your black leaders weren't paid off, they'd be fighting it.
[03:47:18.544 --> 03:47:20.446]  But it's not blacks telling me I'm racist.
[03:47:20.446 --> 03:47:22.988]  It's stupid yuppies.
[03:47:22.988 --> 03:47:26.431]  It's white people.
[03:47:26.431 --> 03:47:27.752]  It's a religion.
[03:47:27.752 --> 03:47:33.678]  You know, by saying you're a racist if you fight Obama, they then push his whole agenda through.
[03:47:33.678 --> 03:47:35.119]  You don't want a carbon tax?
[03:47:35.119 --> 03:47:36.020]  You're a racist.
[03:47:36.020 --> 03:47:37.221]  You don't want open borders?
[03:47:37.221 --> 03:47:38.022]  You're a racist.
[03:47:38.022 --> 03:47:39.083]  You don't want to lose your job?
[03:47:39.083 --> 03:47:39.724]  You're a racist.
[03:47:39.724 --> 03:47:43.047]  You don't want the government controlling and fining you thousands of dollars a year?
[03:47:44.750 --> 03:47:47.992]  If you don't have government health care, you're a racist.
[03:47:47.992 --> 03:47:49.693]  No!
[03:47:49.693 --> 03:47:51.974]  No!
[03:47:51.974 --> 03:47:53.014]  This is tribalism.
[03:47:53.014 --> 03:47:56.516]  They are playing us all off against each other.
[03:47:56.516 --> 03:47:59.058]  You know, tomorrow I'll get more into the whole flu thing.
[03:47:59.058 --> 03:48:01.359]  I prepared a huge folder on all this.
[03:48:01.359 --> 03:48:10.524]  Here is Public Safety Canada media relations with the phone number with Canada saying they're taking part in the drill.
[03:48:11.109 --> 03:48:22.603]  And I've got news articles from 2002 where they signed deals with Canadian and Mexican military to quote use Mexican and Canadian troops in the U.S.
[03:48:22.603 --> 03:48:27.148]  for martial law and to quote take on American terrorists and for insurrection.
[03:48:27.148 --> 03:48:28.230]  This is a fact!
[03:48:29.704 --> 03:48:39.851]  So see, they deny it, deny it, deny it, but if you go to the training and you go read the FEMA press releases that I just put on screen, they say it's to take on American terrorists.
[03:48:39.851 --> 03:48:41.553]  Foreign troops!
[03:48:41.553 --> 03:48:55.523]  I've had Colonel Craig Robertson, whose nephew went through West Point, and they had Wesley Clark and people in there giving him speeches saying, get ready to work with foreign troops to suppress American insurrection.
[03:48:56.400 --> 03:48:58.301]  They are going to use foreign troops.
[03:48:58.301 --> 03:49:01.223]  As crazy as that is, it's real, folks!
[03:49:01.223 --> 03:49:03.444]  This is really going on.
[03:49:03.444 --> 03:49:05.966]  I can show you the video out of the different
[03:49:07.096 --> 03:49:15.523]  To television stations in Florida when they landed troops from more than 12 nations from Latin America to quote, take on American terrorists.
[03:49:15.523 --> 03:49:18.986]  In fact, Google Latin American troops land in Florida.
[03:49:18.986 --> 03:49:24.150]  We could show them the video right now during the break for people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:49:24.150 --> 03:49:25.331]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[03:49:25.331 --> 03:49:26.893]  It's wallowing in evidence.
[03:49:29.145 --> 03:49:32.390]  I have the Army following and watching me.
[03:49:32.390 --> 03:49:35.414]  It's in mainstream news they're doing it.
[03:49:35.414 --> 03:49:40.101]  Months after I tell you because the Army leaks me a secret document because they don't like it.
[03:49:41.277 --> 03:49:45.759]  Folks, we're far down the rat hole when the army is following me around.
[03:49:45.759 --> 03:49:48.320]  They might be following me home today!
[03:49:48.320 --> 03:49:55.964]  I'll be like, oh, there they are behind me and I can take ten turns and they're following me and they'll smile at me and laugh at me, it's all real funny.
[03:49:55.964 --> 03:49:57.485]  It's not funny!
[03:49:57.485 --> 03:49:59.566]  You guys are traitors!
[03:49:59.566 --> 03:50:06.429]  This isn't, you know, they've been over in Baghdad shooting people and torturing people and doing their crap and now they're here and
[03:50:07.466 --> 03:50:11.047]  In fact, Hoos gave me an article earlier that I'm going to have some guests on.
[03:50:11.047 --> 03:50:14.447]  Lethal warriors bring combat hostility home.
[03:50:14.447 --> 03:50:17.648]  One unit where ten of them committed murders.
[03:50:17.648 --> 03:50:21.049]  Units where three or four separately go out and rob banks.
[03:50:21.049 --> 03:50:22.249]  They're just going crazy.
[03:50:22.249 --> 03:50:27.530]  But see, most of them aren't going to have to rob banks because they're used to killing and stealing and breaking down doors.
[03:50:27.530 --> 03:50:30.811]  This screws people up, folks, especially when you do two or three tours.
[03:50:30.811 --> 03:50:32.771]  It screws up about half the people that do one tour.
[03:50:32.771 --> 03:50:33.992]  Now they're all warped.
[03:50:33.992 --> 03:50:35.172]  They're all going to be cops.
[03:50:35.532 --> 03:50:38.074]  They got these kind of guys following me around.
[03:50:38.074 --> 03:50:40.135]  Following Ron Paul around.
[03:50:40.135 --> 03:50:43.737]  Baltimore Sun reported on that.
[03:50:43.737 --> 03:50:45.819]  I mean, this is crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:50:45.819 --> 03:50:49.761]  Now, a lot of the troops are good patriotic people, and they know what's going on.
[03:50:49.761 --> 03:50:54.024]  But, uh, I mean, it is a total martial law grid.
[03:50:54.024 --> 03:50:59.768]  And it is expanding its net right now, and the enemy's building up, it looks like, to move against us.
[03:50:59.768 --> 03:51:00.948]  So, just get ready.
[03:51:00.948 --> 03:51:01.449]  Hold on.
[03:51:02.409 --> 03:51:08.432]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:51:08.432 --> 03:51:14.314]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:51:14.314 --> 03:51:20.477]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:51:20.817 --> 03:51:22.778]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:51:22.778 --> 03:51:25.259]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:51:25.259 --> 03:51:38.443]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:51:38.443 --> 03:51:40.104]  It's not about left or right.
[03:51:40.104 --> 03:51:41.965]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:51:41.965 --> 03:51:48.207]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:51:48.866 --> 03:51:57.131]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:51:57.131 --> 03:51:58.712]  The Obama Deception.
[03:51:58.712 --> 03:51:59.893]  The people strike back!
[03:52:03.883 --> 03:52:08.386]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.

[03:53:01.818 --> 03:53:03.799]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:53:03.799 --> 03:53:10.764]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:53:10.764 --> 03:53:19.170]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:53:19.170 --> 03:53:24.894]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:53:25.214 --> 03:53:25.594]  I don't know.

[03:53:46.343 --> 03:53:47.084]  That's 866-295-5305.

[03:54:14.669 --> 03:54:18.633]  I hurt myself today.
[03:54:18.633 --> 03:54:20.215]  To see if I still feel.
[03:54:20.215 --> 03:54:23.458]  To see if I still feel.
[03:54:23.458 --> 03:54:25.300]  I focus.
[03:54:25.300 --> 03:54:27.742]  I focus on the things.
[03:54:27.742 --> 03:54:32.086]  You know, we'll be back tomorrow, 11am to 3pm, Center Time.
[03:54:32.086 --> 03:54:35.690]  I want to jam in a few final calls here.
[03:54:35.690 --> 03:54:37.131]  Who's up next?
[03:54:37.131 --> 03:54:38.753]  Here, John, I got my call list mixed up.
[03:54:40.379 --> 03:54:41.119]  Mike Virginia.
[03:54:41.119 --> 03:54:44.240]  We'll probably get to Mike in Virginia and Mike in California.
[03:54:44.240 --> 03:54:48.242]  Dwayne and Jim and others we may not get to, but we'll see.
[03:54:48.242 --> 03:54:52.523]  I did want to just in closing thank our sponsors.
[03:54:52.523 --> 03:54:54.344]  One of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[03:54:54.344 --> 03:54:56.285]  A lot of things can happen during these troubled times.
[03:54:56.285 --> 03:54:59.726]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms, the control freak, globalists.
[03:55:00.586 --> 03:55:01.946]  Coming in with their carbon taxes.
[03:55:01.946 --> 03:55:04.547]  It's just good to start getting off the grid.
[03:55:04.547 --> 03:55:06.848]  A great little unit that will power quite a bit in your house.
[03:55:06.848 --> 03:55:09.149]  You can get a bunch of the units to run your whole house.
[03:55:09.149 --> 03:55:11.349]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:55:11.349 --> 03:55:18.231]  It consists of the power source, 1800 watt generator, high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[03:55:18.231 --> 03:55:19.712]  It's MySolarBackup.com.
[03:55:19.712 --> 03:55:20.792]  It's MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[03:55:20.792 --> 03:55:21.392]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:55:21.392 --> 03:55:22.353]  And in closing, a cola blue.
[03:55:30.595 --> 03:55:34.218]  Atmospheric water generator, what I use in my home, what we use in the office.
[03:55:34.218 --> 03:55:36.139]  They've got a new unit out.
[03:55:36.139 --> 03:55:39.382]  They're special, 20% off, ends today.
[03:55:39.382 --> 03:55:41.423]  So I'd call today, 800-691-6043.
[03:55:41.423 --> 03:55:42.484]  800-691-6043.
[03:55:42.484 --> 03:55:52.291]  It grabs the water out of the air and then sends it through seven different filters, including reverse osmosis and a carbon filter.
[03:55:52.291 --> 03:55:53.292]  acolablue.com, 800-691-6043.
[03:55:57.242 --> 03:56:05.931]  And one plug of the day, all my books and videos and materials at InfoWars.com and the online video bookstore that funds our operation, but that's secondary.
[03:56:05.931 --> 03:56:12.438]  Number one, these are great tools to wake people up and folks are ready to be woken up now.
[03:56:12.438 --> 03:56:14.020]  Let's take two final calls.
[03:56:14.020 --> 03:56:16.702]  Mike in Virginia, you're on the air.
[03:56:16.702 --> 03:56:17.203]  Hello Alex.
[03:56:20.826 --> 03:56:29.889]  Um, I'm calling because, uh, I found some images on the dollar bill that, uh, Jordan Maxwell or anybody hasn't found today, uh, that I know of.
[03:56:29.889 --> 03:56:32.430]  Um, I'll try to make this quick because I know you're trying to take other calls.
[03:56:32.430 --> 03:56:37.571]  All right, what you need to do is get about, uh, five to ten dollar, one dollar bills.
[03:56:37.571 --> 03:56:43.593]  The area you're looking for is the white and black dots behind George Washington's head.
[03:56:43.593 --> 03:56:47.414]  You usually turn the dollar bill on its side or upside down, still looking at the front
[03:56:47.890 --> 03:56:48.992]  Of course.
[03:56:48.992 --> 03:56:53.281]  I've found skulls, occult images, just all kinds of stuff.
[03:56:53.281 --> 03:56:56.247]  No, I don't think anybody's seen that.
[03:56:56.247 --> 03:56:58.352]  Well, there's all sorts of secret stuff.
[03:56:59.295 --> 03:57:00.156]  On the dollar bill.
[03:57:00.156 --> 03:57:01.097]  I don't have a dollar bill.
[03:57:01.097 --> 03:57:03.439]  All I have is a 20 and a 10 and a 5.
[03:57:03.439 --> 03:57:07.242]  But it's just filled with occultic stuff.
[03:57:07.242 --> 03:57:08.623]  And they admit it is.
[03:57:08.623 --> 03:57:16.530]  So why don't you scan in that little image, and just that little part of it, and then point it out, write a blurb, and send it to writers at infowars.com.
[03:57:16.530 --> 03:57:20.654]  We're getting a lot of listeners submitted ideas and stuff, and a lot of it's great.
[03:57:20.654 --> 03:57:21.995]  We're posting most of it.
[03:57:21.995 --> 03:57:26.579]  If not, post anything you want in the Prison Planet forum, unless it's calling for violence.
[03:57:27.139 --> 03:57:28.484]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[03:57:34.816 --> 03:57:36.897]  First, I want to thank you for everything that you're doing.
[03:57:36.897 --> 03:57:46.021]  You actually made me feel sane again, because for a long time, I had a lot of people saying, hey, you're crazy for all these things you're thinking.
[03:57:46.021 --> 03:57:46.901]  I'm 31 years old.
[03:57:46.901 --> 03:57:51.123]  I started doing this when I was 18 years old.
[03:57:51.123 --> 03:57:55.425]  I got into studying Babylon and unlocking Babylon.
[03:57:55.425 --> 03:58:00.127]  It got me into the whole monarchy, and I started seeing what the system was really about.
[03:58:02.944 --> 03:58:14.138]  I actually read a book by Alexander Hilflop called The True Babylon, and it, you know, it woke me up to the whole thing and actually seeing, you know, the whole system that our government is in.
[03:58:14.138 --> 03:58:15.380]  It's almost a mirror image of it.
[03:58:17.864 --> 03:58:24.587]  Well, these are Babylonian Mystery School systems of psychology and government and controlling populations.
[03:58:24.587 --> 03:58:29.729]  And if you know that science, then you have a monopoly over everything else in rule.
[03:58:29.729 --> 03:58:34.411]  But somehow they convinced the population not to even look into the sciences of control.
[03:58:34.411 --> 03:58:37.172]  It's our job to just get people to wake up and look around them.
[03:58:37.172 --> 03:58:37.773]  Thank you.
[03:58:37.773 --> 03:58:38.553]  Big show today.
[03:58:38.553 --> 03:58:39.893]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:39.893 --> 03:58:41.154]  Infowars.com.
[03:58:41.154 --> 03:58:43.595]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:43.595 --> 03:58:45.316]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.901 --> 03:58:51.303]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.303 --> 03:58:52.684]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:58:52.684 --> 03:58:54.684]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:58:54.684 --> 03:58:55.665]  Well, you should.
[03:58:55.665 --> 03:59:00.167]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:59:00.167 --> 03:59:00.967]  That's right.
[03:59:00.967 --> 03:59:09.631]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[03:59:09.631 --> 03:59:10.991]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[03:59:10.991 --> 03:59:12.132]  Plus, if you act fast.
[03:59:12.332 --> 03:59:18.315]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:59:18.315 --> 03:59:25.218]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[03:59:25.218 --> 03:59:30.741]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[03:59:30.741 --> 03:59:32.201]  This is real.
[03:59:32.201 --> 03:59:33.242]  Don't miss out.
[03:59:33.242 --> 03:59:40.125]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[03:59:40.345 --> 03:59:40.766]  I think so.
