[00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:12.154]  Is it getting better?
[00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:14.636]  Is it getting better?
[00:00:18.037 --> 00:00:19.858]  Or do you feel the same?
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.961]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:34.094]  In the end, Barack Obama should thank me for making Fall of the Republic.
[00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.477]  So should that sickening traitor, George W. Bush.
[00:00:40.558 --> 00:00:46.961]  Because these films, The Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic, document that they're just puppets and frontmen.
[00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:52.424]  And though they're guilty of many of the crimes carried out by their bosses, they are only frontmen.
[00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:53.645]  Foot soldiers.
[00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:54.805]  Enforcers.
[00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:55.766]  Capos.
[00:00:56.914 --> 00:01:00.500]  And they build them up, and then destroy them, and then bring in the next puppet.
[00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:03.485]  And that's why Fall of the Republic is so important.
[00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:07.391]  It entails the police state, the banking takeover, the global carbon tax, everything.
[00:01:07.732 --> 00:01:09.314]  This is the film for this time.
[00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:11.317]  This is my most powerful film.
[00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:14.039]  And everyone needs to see it.
[00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:20.344]  I'm asking you to order the DVD at Infowars.com today on the online video bookstore shopping cart.
[00:01:20.744 --> 00:01:22.606]  I'm asking you to make copies of it.
[00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:28.550]  I'm asking you to get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and download the DivX version and burn it to disk and give it to everyone you know.
[00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:30.912]  I'm asking you to take action.
[00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:34.634]  I'm asking you to call the toll-free number 888-253-3139 and to not wait and not count on others.
[00:01:34.654 --> 00:01:35.575]  The Obama deception
[00:01:41.857 --> 00:01:42.858]  Has been devastating.
[00:01:42.878 --> 00:01:50.145]  They have written scores of mainstream news articles attacking me for the Obama deception and admitting it's hurt them.
[00:01:52.807 --> 00:01:54.289]  That's because of you taking action.
[00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.431]  Sure, I'm the quarterback.
[00:01:56.991 --> 00:02:02.957]  I got the ball downfield, but you have been the receivers that are marching down the enemy lines and we're having victories.
[00:02:03.497 --> 00:02:04.799]  Let's redouble our efforts.
[00:02:05.796 --> 00:02:07.297]  Because we're coming from behind here.
[00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:09.318]  We're putting points on the board.
[00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:13.220]  We have got to come from behind with a winning spirit and beat these people.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.322]  And this is the big football game that actually matters for your family and your future.
[00:02:18.362 --> 00:02:20.883]  This tyranny is unlike any tyranny we've ever seen.
[00:02:20.903 --> 00:02:22.204]  This is not a boss hog tyranny.
[00:02:22.464 --> 00:02:23.204]  Those are bad enough.
[00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:30.488]  This is a scientifically crafted system that is designed to stop us from defeating them.
[00:02:30.748 --> 00:02:32.649]  But if we're aware of their tricks, we can stop them.
[00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.010]  The Obama deception
[00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.831]  And follow the Republic.
[00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:38.092]  Both these films need to be gotten out to everybody.
[00:02:40.013 --> 00:02:40.313]  Okay.
[00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:46.616]  For the rest of this hour, I'm going to do a news blitz, then we're going to open phones.
[00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:46.696]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:50.138]  I wanted to get Timothy Baldwin on, first time he's been with us.
[00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:56.242]  And he attended the University of West Florida, received a bachelor's degree in English, political science.
[00:02:56.702 --> 00:02:58.343]  There he went to Cumberland Law School.
[00:02:59.807 --> 00:03:01.267]  And we appreciate him coming on.
[00:03:01.287 --> 00:03:07.369]  He began his career at the state attorney's office in Florida.
[00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:09.409]  And it goes on from there.
[00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:11.970]  In 2006, Baldwin opened his law office in Pensacola.
[00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.490]  He's also helped his dad on his campaign for president.
[00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.872]  And we've had Chuck Baldwin on so many times in the last 12, 13, 14, 13 years I've been interviewing Chuck Baldwin.
[00:03:20.892 --> 00:03:21.912]  I thought we'd have him on.
[00:03:22.152 --> 00:03:27.153]  Plus, he's got a talent for breaking down history and the facts, just like his father.
[00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.930]  Chuck Baldwin.
[00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:43.080]  So Timothy Baldwin joins us for the next 25 minutes till this hour ends, then news blitz, then your phone calls for Skip, Victor, Amber, Cody, Dayton, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.542]  We're going to get to you as well today.
[00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:49.685]  And I'm going to get into the New York Times, an article, an editorial written by the
[00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:55.586]  UN Secretary General calling for world government and saying the key to it all is the carbon tax.
[00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:57.487]  We're going to break that down today.
[00:03:57.907 --> 00:04:02.048]  And they are announcing there will be taxes on all of your meat eating pets.
[00:04:03.668 --> 00:04:05.189]  Remember, Hitler was a vegetarian.
[00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:07.049]  This is the eugenicist religion.
[00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:09.750]  This is the religion of the chicken neck control freak.
[00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.850]  So we're going to go over it all today.
[00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.331]  Timothy Baldwin, Esquire, good to have you on with us today.
[00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:18.172]  It's my pleasure to be on your show, Alex.
[00:04:18.232 --> 00:04:18.932]  Thank you for having me.
[00:04:19.514 --> 00:04:20.515]  It's good to have you.
[00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:25.477]  Well, growing up, seeing your dad fight the New World Order, it's good to see you fighting it today.
[00:04:25.937 --> 00:04:31.360]  Tell us a little bit about your take on the state of the world right now and this key point in history.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.903]  When the New World Order is openly emerging, people are waking up, but we're in a limited window to defeat them.
[00:04:37.203 --> 00:04:42.206]  Then let's get into your latest article, Freedom's Destruction Through Constitutional Deconstruction.
[00:04:43.672 --> 00:05:02.820]  Well, you know Alex, as you've highlighted on your show for so many years, the corruption of the federal government, I think it would be, you would have to have your head completely in the sand not to know that... You know what?
[00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:06.962]  We lost your phone again and it's the exact same sound with our last guest.
[00:05:07.022 --> 00:05:08.103]  It may be our system.
[00:05:08.143 --> 00:05:09.363]  We had a huge crash.
[00:05:09.984 --> 00:05:10.624]  It is our system?
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.481]  We had a huge crash, Timothy, yesterday.
[00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:17.222]  Can we go to an analog phone or something else with him immediately?
[00:05:18.502 --> 00:05:23.284]  Because this is really... We're going to go to the Genesis Network.
[00:05:23.304 --> 00:05:27.685]  We're going to go back to them doing the phone calls for now, until this is fixed.
[00:05:27.705 --> 00:05:30.286]  We're going to go back to Mr. Baldwin.
[00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:32.827]  There I was, griping at my guest yesterday for bad phones.
[00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:34.387]  And I know that sound.
[00:05:34.427 --> 00:05:34.888]  That's us.
[00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:39.149]  And I go back to the issue of funding.
[00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:45.443]  I need to hire an extra IT person.
[00:05:45.703 --> 00:05:46.223]  Desperately.
[00:05:46.944 --> 00:05:47.805]  We need three.
[00:05:48.706 --> 00:05:52.509]  I mean, these guys were up here this weekend when we had a server crash with the mail server.
[00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.253]  We had this whole system go haywire Sunday where Burmas couldn't even do a show.
[00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:58.474]  I'm not complaining.
[00:06:01.016 --> 00:06:09.984]  We have had just constant issues and we've had consultants in here, they say our IT guys are extremely talented and are doing a fabulous job, but
[00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:18.849]  There's just too much for them to do, because they're busy fixing broken computers and all sorts of other stuff and dealing with this.
[00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.214]  So please continue to support us, ladies and gentlemen, because we have a great cost here.
[00:06:24.254 --> 00:06:35.483]  Okay, let's start over, Timothy Baldwin, with the point you were making about having to have your head examined if you think the government isn't out of control.
[00:06:35.524 --> 00:06:35.824]  Go ahead.
[00:06:36.573 --> 00:06:44.678]  Yeah, you know, Alex, I think the, as our founder said, that the evidences are clear of the usurpations and the abuses of government.
[00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:53.543]  I mean, you know, we could sit here and talk for months and months about the corruption that we've seen and what we believe it means and where it's leading us.
[00:06:53.683 --> 00:07:02.869]  I think that the evidence is very clear that they're trying to unite the nations in a global type economy and structure, of course.
[00:07:03.413 --> 00:07:08.177]  This goes in line with their desire for power and money.
[00:07:08.197 --> 00:07:14.422]  It's the nature of mankind to use other people for their advantage, and this is what we're seeing.
[00:07:15.843 --> 00:07:29.715]  What I have tried to do is I have tried to study history, particularly our history, to see what cures there are for this type of abuse and this type of encroachment.
[00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:48.742]  You know, my conclusion is that it's similar to what Alexander Hamilton said, and of course I'm no fan of Alexander Hamilton, but I believe what he said in the Federalist Papers was very true, and that is, to best preserve freedom, you need power to be able to check power.
[00:07:49.663 --> 00:07:56.868]  And of course, the context of what he said there was that the state governments were to be used to check the federal government.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.942]  A separation of powers.
[00:08:00.262 --> 00:08:06.549]  Powers set against themselves and that was one of the few issues that the founders unanimously agreed upon.
[00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:15.579]  They just debated about how to arrange that structure and they did a lot off the Greek and of course the common law in England and of course off the Dutch system.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.240]  As you know
[00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:20.743]  But now that's been undermined by the foreign offshore corporations.
[00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:22.885]  That's why we need to take over the local governments.
[00:08:23.485 --> 00:08:28.348]  And that's why we need to also, as patriots, take over the government and have the long view of history.
[00:08:28.368 --> 00:08:38.395]  And that's why we need to financially support alternative media and institutions so that we can grow our power to then be able to face down the establishment.
[00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:38.856]  Go ahead.
[00:08:39.756 --> 00:08:44.820]  Well, you know, and this is something that I'm trying to educate people when I talk and when I write about this subject.
[00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.132]  You know, when you study our history, one thing is very clear.
[00:08:48.732 --> 00:08:54.436]  Our founders and the ratifiers of our Constitution rejected the national form of government.
[00:08:54.877 --> 00:09:06.545]  And they were very clear that what they wanted was a federal system, that is, the states had co-equal power with regard to all the powers that they retained under the 10th Amendment.
[00:09:06.945 --> 00:09:07.786]  And 9th.
[00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:09.447]  And the 9th Amendment as well.
[00:09:10.391 --> 00:09:13.533]  But the problem, what we have here, if we look through the U.S.
[00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:19.855]  Supreme Court decisions, we have a complete reversal of that idea and that understanding.
[00:09:20.196 --> 00:09:22.517]  And that starts after the Civil War, does it not?
[00:09:23.217 --> 00:09:36.623]  Well, it started before that because the U.S., particularly under Joseph Story's court and also, of course, John Marshall, they tried to establish through their decisions
[00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:45.144]  That the federal court, I mean, that the federal government was a supreme sovereignty over the state's sovereignties through the supremacy clause.
[00:09:45.645 --> 00:09:48.206]  And what they tried to establish was the U.S.
[00:09:48.246 --> 00:09:52.509]  Supreme Court has the ultimate final decision on what the Constitution means.
[00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.932]  And that's just contrary to what our federal system is all about.
[00:09:56.452 --> 00:10:00.615]  It is power checking power, state power checking federal power.
[00:10:00.695 --> 00:10:05.358]  And as you just mentioned, after the Civil War, they really were able to grab a hold of that idea.
[00:10:05.891 --> 00:10:06.211]  Absolutely.
[00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:13.800]  And from the beginning, the founder stated it was a confederation of states that met to arbitrate their disputes in the Federal Congress, but that any time a state wanted to leave,
[00:10:27.074 --> 00:10:32.197]  Yes, exactly, and you know Alex, if there's one thing I would wish people would get a concept of, and that is
[00:10:54.969 --> 00:11:02.253]  The concept that the states have just as much power to defend freedom as any other sovereign country or sovereign state.
[00:11:02.293 --> 00:11:04.554]  But they must exercise that power.
[00:11:05.215 --> 00:11:05.655]  They must.
[00:11:05.775 --> 00:11:09.617]  And unfortunately, for more than a hundred years, the states have really not done that.
[00:11:10.077 --> 00:11:23.725]  It's only until recently that the states are actually becoming more aware of their powers under the Tenth Amendment, all the retained powers that they have, to try to once again reestablish these ideals of freedom that we hold.
[00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:26.090]  And it's good to see some of the states doing that.
[00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:33.413]  I'm sure you're very familiar with the Montana Firearms Freedom Act, which I am actually a part of that litigation, by the way.
[00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:34.293]  Well, good!
[00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:36.694]  For those that don't know about it, why don't you tell people?
[00:11:37.526 --> 00:11:43.491]  Well, it's a law that was passed in Montana, and of course in Tennessee as well, and other states are introducing this bill.
[00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:47.695]  And it's got the feds very, very scared, and it's something you and your father helped lead.
[00:11:48.135 --> 00:11:51.679]  Another example of ideas, putting them into action.
[00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:52.800]  True leadership.
[00:11:54.441 --> 00:11:58.645]  And if others get behind this, it is a tide that is going to be unstoppable.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:17.932]  Exactly, because what it says is, look, if we create this product, in this case it's a gun, but it could be anything, if we create this product and we sell it within our sovereign borders, in this case the state of Montana, then the federal regulations have no applicability in that state whatsoever.
[00:12:17.953 --> 00:12:20.474]  The Interstate Commerce Clause has no authority.
[00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:21.815]  Exactly.
[00:12:22.456 --> 00:12:23.616]  And that's what we're trying to do.
[00:12:23.636 --> 00:12:27.499]  And of course, you know, I wasn't the great people in Montana that
[00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:28.502]  I don't think.
[00:12:46.109 --> 00:12:46.649]  We're good to go.
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:24.123]  So as soon as the states realize that they have the power to stop this almost overnight, we may see a chance of restoration in this country.
[00:13:24.163 --> 00:13:30.326]  But until we get back to this idea, I don't believe that we're going to have much of a chance short of just outright revolution.
[00:13:30.626 --> 00:13:35.048]  And I don't think many people want to go down that road because of the cost it entails at this point.
[00:13:35.728 --> 00:13:42.351]  But the point is that we have to get back to the ideas of federalism, which were the protecting guardians of freedom in this country.
[00:13:43.783 --> 00:13:44.303]  Absolutely.
[00:13:44.343 --> 00:13:47.064]  Go through the battle plan that you break down in this article.
[00:13:48.685 --> 00:14:05.810]  Well, you're referring to the freedom of destruction through constitutional... Sure, and some of the other articles, you and the Constitution Party, your father and others have been putting out, battle plans, dealing with the states, teaching people the right and proper duties of the state and the people that reside within the states.
[00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.851]  Well, that particular article that I wrote,
[00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:23.660]  What I try to do is highlight the fact that during the Constitutional Convention debates, the founders and the ratifiers rejected this notion that the federal government has the power to negate state laws.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:34.368]  In other words, under the Tenth Amendment, the state laws under their sovereignty was not to be negated by the federal laws.
[00:14:36.856 --> 00:14:38.076]  They rejected that idea.
[00:14:38.096 --> 00:14:53.226]  So in other words, the states still have the power to do this, and it's through the constitutional amendment process that the states are to decide what they want the Constitution to be, to preserve the freedoms.
[00:14:53.867 --> 00:15:00.111]  And what I'll try to do is highlight the fact that this is not what has been told us over the past 100 years.
[00:15:00.451 --> 00:15:01.712]  We've been told that the U.S.
[00:15:01.792 --> 00:15:04.794]  Supreme Court and the federal government has sovereign
[00:15:06.526 --> 00:15:14.429]  The history is very clear on this subject, Alex.
[00:15:14.469 --> 00:15:19.711]  Of course, I'm sure you know this, but your listeners need to understand that this is very clear.
[00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:26.814]  We know that the founders rejected the nationalistic idea that states are to have the same co-equal powers.
[00:15:28.723 --> 00:15:35.870]  That's co-equal on the few, the three powers delegated to the federal government.
[00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:46.762]  The states are actually superior to the federal government because all powers not expressly delegated to the federal government are expressly reserved to the states or the people.
[00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:48.319]  Exactly right.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:16:08.393]  You know, if you take a look at what they rejected, what they actually proposed during the conventions for the federal government to have power to regulate, if you look at that, it mentioned agriculture, it mentioned education, it mentioned commerce in general, and they actually rejected those and removed those from the federal government's power.
[00:16:08.413 --> 00:16:15.898]  So yes, their power is very, very limited, and it's only been through this supposed living constitution idea
[00:16:16.688 --> 00:16:24.270]  That we have been defrauded, and criminally, I think, defrauded from our natural rights of compact here.
[00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.950]  But the point of the matter is this.
[00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:34.192]  The states have the power to reclaim these powers that have been taken from them, because it's their power.
[00:16:34.272 --> 00:16:37.392]  It's the power that they got from the sovereigns of their state, that is, the people.
[00:16:37.912 --> 00:16:45.134]  Yes, they've usurped our power, and now the state tells us they're God, and police are taught worshipping the government.
[00:16:46.501 --> 00:16:47.722]  Right.
[00:16:48.582 --> 00:16:48.782]  Right.
[00:16:49.382 --> 00:16:52.424]  It's very dangerous and we've just become so used to it.
[00:16:52.464 --> 00:16:55.065]  We've become mind slaves to their agenda.
[00:16:55.545 --> 00:17:00.827]  And we need a serious awakening and enlightenment of this understanding.
[00:17:00.847 --> 00:17:06.510]  But once people understand this, it will cause a tremendous movement, I believe,
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:15.550]  And restoring our republic because, you know, it's like the competition of commerce or the economic competition model.
[00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:24.681]  This will be a competition of ideas that will allow the 50 states to once again find out what works best within their state, within their borders.
[00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:26.490]  Absolutely, and the COINTELPRO operatives
[00:17:42.532 --> 00:17:46.395]  Every time we try to build something or a movement, they'll go, it's not instant.
[00:17:46.696 --> 00:17:47.396]  You're stupid.
[00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:48.717]  We need to just shoot everybody.
[00:17:49.238 --> 00:17:50.799]  They always turn out to be feds.
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.241]  They know we're in the right.
[00:17:53.562 --> 00:17:58.146]  And if we just orderly, in an orderly way, educate people, we're going to win.
[00:17:58.506 --> 00:17:58.966]  Stay there.
[00:17:58.986 --> 00:18:00.528]  We'll be right back with Timothy Baldwin.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.642]  Worried that inflation will ruin your retirement or plans of sending your kids to college?
[00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:06.743]  Get a pencil.
[00:18:06.983 --> 00:18:09.764]  Discover how to turn $10,000 into possibly $431,000 in the next 12 to 18 months.
[00:18:10.044 --> 00:18:13.626]  For example, investors who took Scott Smith's advice and invested $10,000 in Silver Standard Resources turned it into $431,000.
[00:18:13.766 --> 00:18:16.528]  And those who invested in Seabridge Gold Shares turned $10,000 into $800,000.
[00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:34.514]  Scott Smith is the former senior executive of Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential.
[00:18:39.031 --> 00:18:39.411]  I think so.
[00:19:02.538 --> 00:19:06.185]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:19:06.566 --> 00:19:09.571]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:19:09.812 --> 00:19:14.581]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.824]  They have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:19:20.984 --> 00:19:26.008]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[00:19:26.188 --> 00:19:29.310]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:36.215]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:19:36.295 --> 00:19:38.417]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:19:38.637 --> 00:19:39.978]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:19:40.238 --> 00:19:42.580]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.481]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:19:44.781 --> 00:19:49.624]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:19:49.944 --> 00:19:54.707]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:54.907 --> 00:19:59.029]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:02.486]  The once mighty U.S.
[00:20:02.526 --> 00:20:05.128]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[00:20:05.548 --> 00:20:08.150]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[00:20:08.231 --> 00:20:11.053]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[00:20:11.413 --> 00:20:15.196]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[00:20:15.697 --> 00:20:19.800]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.305]  And Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[00:20:23.786 --> 00:20:24.567]  Prepare now!
[00:20:25.048 --> 00:20:29.575]  Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[00:20:29.976 --> 00:20:35.084]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish, with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:20:35.464 --> 00:20:39.767]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you're buying Factory Direct at wholesale prices.
[00:20:40.267 --> 00:20:42.129]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[00:21:06.903 --> 00:21:11.708]  Chuck Baldwin's politically active lawyer's son, fighting the tyranny, joins us.
[00:21:12.609 --> 00:21:17.234]  Wrote the column, Freedom's Destruction Through Constitutional Deconstruction.
[00:21:18.697 --> 00:21:25.743]  Got about five minutes left, and I'm coming back with phone calls with the first five-minute segment, then a news blitz, then more phone calls, then Lindsey Williams.
[00:21:26.424 --> 00:21:33.110]  You want to hear about the UN openly announcing world government yet again, arrogantly, and how the carbon tax is the key to it all.
[00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:40.336]  And I think the key for us to understand, Mr. Baldwin, is that we are running out of time.
[00:21:40.396 --> 00:21:42.959]  We are now here inside the world government.
[00:21:43.874 --> 00:21:54.820]  Instead of corruption that's running rampant, just stagnating, it's blooming, and now is the time for everybody to start seeing themselves as leaders and getting involved.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.223]  And it doesn't mean we'll save the world by ourselves, but many hands make light work.
[00:22:00.403 --> 00:22:02.724]  Closing comments, Timothy Baldwin.
[00:22:04.045 --> 00:22:12.269]  Well, Alex, I think that we are, in fact, short of time, and I believe that we are at a decision similar to our founding fathers,
[00:22:13.697 --> 00:22:24.707]  Like Samuel Adams said, we either decide to declare our independence now and live as free men, or we decide to just go along and live as slaves.
[00:22:25.127 --> 00:22:27.369]  And I truly believe that we are reaching that point.
[00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:32.814]  And as you said, we are not going to be able to save the world by ourselves, but we can try to save our communities.
[00:22:33.254 --> 00:22:34.676]  We can try to save our states.
[00:22:35.116 --> 00:22:39.360]  And that's exactly the model that the Founding Fathers gave to us to keep
[00:22:39.964 --> 00:22:43.726]  Uh, matters that affect us the most on a state and local level.
[00:22:44.206 --> 00:22:51.749]  And when we do that, we will keep the federal government and those people who would use us as their little pawns, we will keep them at bay.
[00:22:52.550 --> 00:23:06.056]  And we need zero compromise, and to know the politicians' tricks, both parties, and to really get aggressive and just say, look, I see through all your corporate scams, I know you got handbooks on how to lie to me, the games are over!
[00:23:07.148 --> 00:23:21.164]  And if that means following a corrupt judge as an investigative reporter and catching him with hookers, if that means, you know, I mean, it's time to start playing hardball with this scum.
[00:23:21.544 --> 00:23:22.526]  They're all criminals.
[00:23:23.206 --> 00:23:25.309]  We need to go after them legally and lawfully.
[00:23:26.418 --> 00:23:32.601]  I agree with that, and I think, too, it's time for the people to really start what I would consider to be ignoring the federal government.
[00:23:32.641 --> 00:23:39.444]  In other words, you know, don't give them the flattery that they're getting from us.
[00:23:40.124 --> 00:23:40.765]  Ignore them.
[00:23:41.025 --> 00:23:46.967]  They're not officials, they're not authorities, and at the same time... Go ahead.
[00:23:47.788 --> 00:23:48.828]  They're illegitimate, Alex.
[00:23:49.408 --> 00:23:53.750]  And I think with that, if we can focus on our state legislators, our state governors,
[00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:07.856]  If we can start getting those people to realize our concerns and actually have them represent us, and not just us, but represent the principles of freedom, I think that we can restore this republic.
[00:24:08.276 --> 00:24:11.578]  But unfortunately, not all states are going to go along with that.
[00:24:11.618 --> 00:24:17.661]  There will be some that of course ignore that and will go along with this agenda that has been shoved down our throats for so many years.
[00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:20.342]  But Alex, it is time for us to step up.
[00:24:21.563 --> 00:24:23.944]  We cannot be lethargic any longer.
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.061]  We have to do this now, and that's why I appreciate what you're doing so much.
[00:24:41.587 --> 00:24:44.068]  It's been a process, but more and more are waking up.
[00:24:44.448 --> 00:24:46.509]  And people aren't saying we need to fix the government.
[00:24:46.749 --> 00:24:52.271]  They're saying the whole thing's rotten, the whole thing's corrupt, the whole thing's evil, and it's over.
[00:24:53.231 --> 00:24:54.632]  And the establishment knows that.
[00:24:54.672 --> 00:24:58.373]  That's why they're trying to come in to intimidate people and to bring in this tyranny.
[00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:00.434]  But that is not going to work.
[00:25:00.954 --> 00:25:03.035]  And so I salute you and I appreciate you.
[00:25:03.395 --> 00:25:06.417]  Fire out a website where folks can learn more about what you're doing.
[00:25:06.437 --> 00:25:07.377]  The Tenth Amendment Center.
[00:25:08.548 --> 00:25:10.369]  Well, the TIP Amendment Center is a great website.
[00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:11.831]  It's run by Michael Bolden.
[00:25:11.851 --> 00:25:12.891]  He does a great job.
[00:25:13.452 --> 00:25:19.016]  My website actually is www.LibertyDefenseLeague.com.
[00:25:19.956 --> 00:25:24.459]  And folks can get involved with the Liberty Defense League at LibertyDefenseLeague.com.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.941]  Vaya con Dios, Timothy.
[00:25:27.682 --> 00:25:28.242]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:25:28.762 --> 00:25:29.703]  Thank you for joining us.

[00:25:51.068 --> 00:25:56.250]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.311]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:25:58.471 --> 00:26:00.753]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:26:00.913 --> 00:26:02.753]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:04.534]  You don't have to cooperate.

[00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:06.551]  Big Brother.
[00:27:07.212 --> 00:27:08.272]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:08.993 --> 00:27:10.093]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:10.734 --> 00:27:11.554]  You want answers?
[00:27:12.315 --> 00:27:13.255]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:13.275 --> 00:27:17.578]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:18.078 --> 00:27:22.180]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:22.781 --> 00:27:24.522]  I get behind on my news blitzes.
[00:27:24.562 --> 00:27:26.203]  There's one coming up in the next segment.
[00:27:26.243 --> 00:27:27.103]  Key information.
[00:27:27.584 --> 00:27:29.105]  Skip in Louisiana.
[00:27:29.145 --> 00:27:29.785]  You're on the air.
[00:27:29.845 --> 00:27:30.545]  Welcome, Skip.
[00:27:30.585 --> 00:27:31.226]  Thanks for holding.
[00:27:32.887 --> 00:27:33.647]  Hey there, Al.
[00:27:33.887 --> 00:27:34.247]  You there?
[00:27:34.568 --> 00:27:34.908]  Yes, sir.
[00:27:35.816 --> 00:27:36.296]  Alright, man.
[00:27:37.037 --> 00:27:37.417]  Listen.
[00:27:38.538 --> 00:27:41.620]  I've been on hold for like an hour, but that's alright.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.181]  Okay, but you told us.
[00:27:43.221 --> 00:27:43.841]  That's important.
[00:27:43.861 --> 00:27:44.262]  We know that now.
[00:27:44.282 --> 00:27:46.443]  I've had my volume go down and down and down.
[00:27:46.463 --> 00:27:49.885]  That might be Big Brother, but you never know.
[00:27:50.306 --> 00:27:52.347]  I doubt that, but go ahead.
[00:27:53.328 --> 00:27:53.628]  Anyway.
[00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:55.029]  You know what?
[00:27:55.729 --> 00:27:58.671]  I've watched your movie you just did.
[00:27:58.691 --> 00:28:00.092]  Alright?
[00:28:01.013 --> 00:28:01.853]  And it was awesome.
[00:28:02.274 --> 00:28:02.634]  Thank you.
[00:28:03.835 --> 00:28:03.975]  And...
[00:28:05.469 --> 00:28:20.339]  There's one question I have, and I can't, I go to YouTube and I can't find it, and it is, it is about our president holding another office in
[00:28:22.224 --> 00:28:23.224]  The UN.
[00:28:24.124 --> 00:28:24.865]  Are you kidding?
[00:28:24.925 --> 00:28:34.066]  I mean, we have news clips in the film where they say, President of the World, the Chairman of the UN Security Council has all the power over the UN.
[00:28:34.086 --> 00:28:35.366]  This is historic.
[00:28:35.906 --> 00:28:39.247]  AP headline, Obama cements U.S.
[00:28:39.267 --> 00:28:42.167]  relationship with the UN by coming first U.S.
[00:28:42.227 --> 00:28:43.228]  President to sit.
[00:28:43.828 --> 00:28:49.409]  I mean, that is the most important, most powerful position in the UN.
[00:28:49.469 --> 00:28:50.289]  Are you saying
[00:28:51.149 --> 00:28:53.370]  That he is not currently the Chairman of the U.N.
[00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:54.151]  Security Council?
[00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:54.571]  No!
[00:28:54.992 --> 00:28:55.232]  No!
[00:28:55.672 --> 00:29:00.835]  I'm saying, why is this not covered by any mainstream media?
[00:29:02.036 --> 00:29:05.538]  Well, when you watch the film, I mean, it's fair use, we'll use a few short clips.
[00:29:06.019 --> 00:29:09.261]  We have CNN, Wolf Blitzer talking about it in another news clip.
[00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:12.543]  I mean, it should be a bigger deal.
[00:29:13.363 --> 00:29:14.504]  Our whole media, like,
[00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:19.234]  My God, you cannot hold two government offices at one time.
[00:29:19.515 --> 00:29:21.636]  Yeah, it violates Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:29:21.656 --> 00:29:23.998]  Constitution, but what did Bush say about that?
[00:29:24.539 --> 00:29:25.860]  Why don't we bring this guy?
[00:29:26.981 --> 00:29:39.771]  Why don't the citizens of the United States bring this guy to the table and say, hey, you're a fascist, you know?
[00:29:41.733 --> 00:29:43.614]  Listen, I appreciate your call, Skip.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.681]  Obama is a puppet, but he was given the U.N.
[00:29:48.721 --> 00:29:49.381]  Peace Prize.
[00:29:49.701 --> 00:29:58.044]  They intended the whole time to make him the head of the rotating 15-member Security Council.
[00:29:58.885 --> 00:30:00.445]  It is the true position in the U.N.
[00:30:00.685 --> 00:30:01.225]  The U.S.
[00:30:01.285 --> 00:30:02.906]  always acts like it doesn't like the U.N.
[00:30:02.926 --> 00:30:07.428]  The United States in 1945 created at the Presidio Naval Base in
[00:30:08.504 --> 00:30:09.144]  San Francisco.
[00:30:09.805 --> 00:30:10.345]  It's run.
[00:30:11.225 --> 00:30:12.966]  Only the Security Council has power.
[00:30:13.626 --> 00:30:19.689]  The rest of it is a debating society to suck in the third world nations so that they can be paid off at the UN.
[00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.132]  And yes, it's a big deal.
[00:30:24.212 --> 00:30:29.716]  That's why on the back cover of the Obama deception, I'll show you a close shot of that, I make the point.
[00:30:30.097 --> 00:30:32.919]  President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:30:32.939 --> 00:30:37.603]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[00:30:37.643 --> 00:30:38.864]  President to chair the world body.
[00:30:39.264 --> 00:30:46.890]  That's why Henry Kissinger and all these elitists were there, just in awe, and mouths were hanging open when he did it, because this was
[00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:51.012]  The Associated Press said Obama brings us into the New World Order.
[00:30:51.712 --> 00:30:55.354]  I mean, this is serious, serious big medicine.
[00:30:56.075 --> 00:30:56.935]  Powerful medicine.
[00:30:57.616 --> 00:30:58.596]  And it's poison medicine.
[00:30:59.116 --> 00:31:03.919]  I mean, this is big wampum for the New World Order to do this.
[00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:10.063]  It is just such a big deal to
[00:31:11.775 --> 00:31:13.936]  Have Barack Obama do this, and they're just training us.
[00:31:14.756 --> 00:31:20.899]  NLEO 9, FEMA, 14 nations, foreign troops training to quote, take on American domestic terrorists.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.121]  And we have the DHS manual, it's gun owners, veterans, conservatives.
[00:31:25.522 --> 00:31:26.922]  They're just throwing the gauntlet down.
[00:31:26.962 --> 00:31:28.303]  World government, new world order.
[00:31:28.683 --> 00:31:39.508]  Coming up, I'm going to get into Ban Ki-moon, the head of the United Nations, in the New York Times, in an editorial, saying global government's here.
[00:31:39.528 --> 00:31:40.889]  We're going to tax your butt.
[00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:43.419]  Here it is right here.
[00:31:43.439 --> 00:31:44.620]  It's coming up.
[00:31:45.861 --> 00:31:48.142]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers can see it right here in front of me.
[00:31:49.242 --> 00:31:50.803]  We'll be back after this quick break.
[00:31:52.104 --> 00:31:53.545]  And we will continue with your phone calls.
[00:31:53.585 --> 00:31:54.825]  First I'm going to do a news blitz.
[00:31:55.406 --> 00:31:56.666]  Stay with us ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:56.686 --> 00:31:57.627]  We shall prevail.
[00:32:01.072 --> 00:32:03.993]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:32:04.453 --> 00:32:07.615]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:08.075 --> 00:32:12.437]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:32:12.657 --> 00:32:18.239]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[00:32:18.539 --> 00:32:23.023]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:32:23.304 --> 00:32:26.366]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:32:26.927 --> 00:32:31.331]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:32:31.752 --> 00:32:38.058]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:32:38.318 --> 00:32:40.260]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.563]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:32:43.943 --> 00:32:47.986]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[00:32:48.447 --> 00:32:50.649]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:50.709]  877-327-0365.
[00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:51.670]  Don't wait, call today!
[00:33:01.718 --> 00:33:04.342]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:33:04.742 --> 00:33:09.709]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:33:10.069 --> 00:33:11.811]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:16.698]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:33:16.698 --> 00:33:17.178]  We're good to go.
[00:33:40.106 --> 00:33:41.086]  How much will you need?
[00:33:41.326 --> 00:33:41.947]  We don't know.
[00:33:42.227 --> 00:33:43.147]  How much do you want?
[00:33:43.347 --> 00:33:44.087]  All you can get.
[00:33:44.267 --> 00:33:45.128]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:45.368 --> 00:33:48.129]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:50.169]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.110]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:05.836]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:34:05.976 --> 00:34:07.879]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:10.322]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:34:10.502 --> 00:34:12.345]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:34:12.785 --> 00:34:14.127]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:34:14.407 --> 00:34:15.449]  There is a solution.
[00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:23.678]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:34:24.098 --> 00:34:31.165]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:34:31.566 --> 00:34:37.212]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[00:34:37.572 --> 00:34:43.155]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:34:43.596 --> 00:34:47.398]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:34:47.738 --> 00:34:54.883]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[00:34:55.203 --> 00:34:58.525]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:08.941]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:35:09.542 --> 00:35:12.528]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:28.166 --> 00:35:36.632]  All right, number one in the news that I want to get into is this article from the New York Times from two days ago.
[00:35:37.072 --> 00:35:38.093]  This is from Sunday.
[00:35:38.754 --> 00:35:42.696]  We can do it by Ban Ki-moon.
[00:35:43.697 --> 00:35:45.799]  The United Nations does exist for new listeners.
[00:35:46.279 --> 00:35:50.142]  He is the Secretary General of an organization called the United Nations.
[00:35:50.885 --> 00:35:52.927]  This was created by private corporate interest.
[00:35:53.007 --> 00:35:58.991]  It is a private corporate body like the World Trade Organization, the XM Bank, the IMF, the World Bank.
[00:35:59.752 --> 00:36:02.494]  Its stated goal is to exterminate at least 80% of the population.
[00:36:05.117 --> 00:36:12.623]  Though extremists want total death of the human species and have pledged to kill themselves when they're the last human standing.
[00:36:13.163 --> 00:36:21.629]  And we've read the policy reports and gone over it here when I spoke out against Dr. Eric Bianca, the UT professor, saying he wants to kill 90% of the public with an airborne Ebola.
[00:36:24.351 --> 00:36:25.172]  When I covered that,
[00:36:27.876 --> 00:36:36.638]  I got emails and calls from his graduate students working in bioweapons and other areas of science, saying, hey, he's a liberal, he only wants to kill 90%.
[00:36:37.478 --> 00:36:39.459]  Humans are a parasite, we all must be killed.
[00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:50.482]  So remember that, that their main goal is eco-science, the government policy book, written by the White House science czar, calling for world population reduction, sterilization of the water and vaccines.
[00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:52.222]  Just remember that.
[00:36:52.982 --> 00:36:54.963]  Keep this book right here, because it's the most
[00:36:56.552 --> 00:37:01.997]  Yeah, 1100 pages, but most concise and the most honest book by these enemies of humanity.
[00:37:03.258 --> 00:37:12.144]  Now, he says in this article, we want to thank John Kerry, Senator John Kerry and Senator Lindsey Graham for their leadership.
[00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:14.366]  He says we are on the verge of the U.S.
[00:37:14.426 --> 00:37:20.431]  Senate, this is the head of the U.N., the head of the puppet U.N., the head of the General Assembly, Ban Ki-moon.
[00:37:23.783 --> 00:37:31.508]  And he says, we are on the verge of passing the global greenhouse gas emissions tax inside the United States.
[00:37:32.348 --> 00:37:37.412]  And that is in paragraph 5 of the article.
[00:37:37.932 --> 00:37:38.192]  U.S.
[00:37:38.232 --> 00:37:39.153]  leadership is crucial.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:47.583]  That is why I'm encouraged by the spirit of compromise shown in the bipartisan initiative announced last week by Senator John Kerry and Senator Lindsey Graham.
[00:37:48.243 --> 00:37:49.083]  Here was a pair of U.S.
[00:37:49.103 --> 00:37:56.706]  Senators, one Republican, one Democrat, coming together to bridge their party's differences to address climate change in a spirit of genuine give-and-take.
[00:37:56.726 --> 00:37:59.027]  And he's the guy who attacks Ron Paul.
[00:37:59.347 --> 00:38:00.368]  He knows who his enemy is.
[00:38:00.408 --> 00:38:02.688]  Lindsey Graham is an abomination.
[00:38:03.729 --> 00:38:07.970]  He is an absolute, total, and complete abomination.
[00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:09.331]  He says one thing and does another.
[00:38:11.721 --> 00:38:15.384]  It says, every day this critical December summit in Copenhagen grows closer.
[00:38:15.944 --> 00:38:20.848]  All agree that climate change is an existential threat to humankind.
[00:38:21.788 --> 00:38:23.770]  This is a way to say humankind is bad.
[00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.493]  Yet agreement on what to do seems to elude us still.
[00:38:27.933 --> 00:38:28.433]  It goes on.
[00:38:29.794 --> 00:38:37.140]  He says in the third to last paragraph, a deal must include an equitable global governance structure
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.523]  All countries must have a voice in how resources are deployed and managed.
[00:38:42.623 --> 00:38:47.526]  Oh yes, you'll have a voice within the UN, controlled by private banks, on where the resources go.
[00:38:49.188 --> 00:38:50.849]  That is how trust will be built.
[00:38:54.111 --> 00:38:55.472]  And it goes on from there.
[00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:58.555]  And they are seizing complete control of everything.
[00:38:59.275 --> 00:39:02.297]  And you search engine the term global governance.
[00:39:02.838 --> 00:39:05.900]  Hundreds of articles a week say global government or global governance.
[00:39:06.661 --> 00:39:08.202]  Thousands per week.
[00:39:10.074 --> 00:39:16.577]  Say, New World Order, and then describe it, a private banking dictatorship that controls every facet of your lives.
[00:39:16.997 --> 00:39:26.562]  Let's together go to a search engine, Yahoo, startpage.com, Google, let's go to Google, and let's type in global governance and click news.
[00:39:26.602 --> 00:39:28.563]  Let's do it together on screen.
[00:39:28.743 --> 00:39:31.804]  Let's punch up the computer and type it in for everybody.
[00:39:32.845 --> 00:39:33.685]  Global governance.
[00:39:34.386 --> 00:39:39.108]  Now I had callers this morning when I was on a local talk station, calling and saying I'm making this up.
[00:39:40.216 --> 00:39:43.359]  Global governance does not exist.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.665]  Now there's the New York Times, Bankai Moon, that's the second link.
[00:39:49.786 --> 00:39:52.128]  But how many articles with global governance in it?
[00:39:52.429 --> 00:39:52.729]  It says 1,013.
[00:39:54.250 --> 00:40:02.299]  In the second block, they always have the top story, the newest on top, then under that they have a block that says, in the last week,
[00:40:04.036 --> 00:40:05.957]  That's what that link shows, that bottom green link.
[00:40:06.398 --> 00:40:11.401]  The last week, in the last seven days, 1,013 articles.
[00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:14.223]  See, when I say hundreds a week, it's far worse.
[00:40:14.243 --> 00:40:16.444]  People say, oh, he just says hundreds or says dozens.
[00:40:16.825 --> 00:40:20.307]  Yeah, I mean, I don't normally have the number in front of me, so I'll just lowball it.
[00:40:21.968 --> 00:40:24.189]  I'll say that China killed 64 million people.
[00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.810]  That's what the U.S.
[00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:25.390]  government says.
[00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:26.811]  China says they killed 80 million.
[00:40:30.694 --> 00:40:31.294]  1,013 new articles.
[00:40:36.889 --> 00:40:39.591]  With the term global governance.
[00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:46.635]  And then there's a Los Angeles Times article, I mentioned another article about this yesterday out of England.
[00:40:47.536 --> 00:40:51.238]  Los Angeles Times, FIDO, aka the climate criminal.
[00:40:51.258 --> 00:41:02.846]  Here, let's click on today's top story from 11 hours ago about how your dog, under global governance... Print that for me, I haven't seen this one.
[00:41:03.466 --> 00:41:05.968]  I mean, I could spend a million hours a day, there's not enough hours in the day.
[00:41:07.674 --> 00:41:08.774]  This is my news blitz.
[00:41:09.414 --> 00:41:10.975]  I should just spend the rest of the show on this.
[00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:16.776]  They're going to tax every form of meat, every form of plastic, every form of energy, home inspections.
[00:41:17.176 --> 00:41:18.497]  They're going to tax concrete.
[00:41:18.517 --> 00:41:19.797]  They're going to tax asphalt.
[00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:24.558]  They are openly announcing they're going to tax restaurants, coal, thousands, thousands.
[00:41:24.858 --> 00:41:32.960]  The climate bill in the House, that's passed the House, now in the Senate, says 35 bureaucracies can do anything they want.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.781]  Just like the gun bills they've introduced under Holder.
[00:41:38.726 --> 00:41:44.008]  States that he can just ban any guns he wants or ban you owning a gun without it being arrested or charged.
[00:41:44.048 --> 00:41:44.909]  You just can't own a gun anymore.
[00:41:44.929 --> 00:41:45.749]  You're put on a secret list.
[00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:51.111]  That's what they do now in these articles.
[00:41:52.252 --> 00:41:53.472]  This is how they operate.
[00:41:53.532 --> 00:41:55.313]  This is what they're up to.
[00:41:56.254 --> 00:42:01.196]  And, no exaggeration, thousands of articles a day.
[00:42:02.705 --> 00:42:03.686]  State what they're going to tax.
[00:42:04.246 --> 00:42:06.148]  This is going to be hell.
[00:42:06.808 --> 00:42:08.909]  And they mean for you to go bankrupt.
[00:42:08.929 --> 00:42:12.832]  I always get calls and emails saying, well, who are they going to tax if they bankrupt us all?
[00:42:13.012 --> 00:42:13.893]  They print the money.
[00:42:14.173 --> 00:42:16.775]  They use the taxing system to destroy independence.
[00:42:17.095 --> 00:42:20.738]  The power to tax is the power to destroy, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:42:23.919 --> 00:42:26.602]  Fido, aka the climate criminal, L.A.
[00:42:26.642 --> 00:42:26.902]  Times.
[00:42:27.303 --> 00:42:34.491]  Some climate change activists would take your dog away and spend trillions on other efforts rather than come up with solutions that could actually work to offset carbon levels.
[00:42:34.511 --> 00:42:36.494]  So see, this is how they do it.
[00:42:36.994 --> 00:42:42.340]  They know that you want a choice on whether you're for global taxes or not, so they just make it a choice about
[00:42:43.001 --> 00:42:52.223]  Now come on, we do need to tax cars, and oil, and your house, and beef, and the crops you grow, because they're putting off carbon dioxide.
[00:42:52.283 --> 00:42:53.983]  Plants don't just put off oxygen.
[00:42:54.844 --> 00:42:56.144]  And yes, the plants are bad.
[00:42:56.184 --> 00:42:59.004]  I can pull up articles right now where they're talking about cutting trees down now.
[00:43:02.445 --> 00:43:03.385]  You can't make this up.
[00:43:03.965 --> 00:43:05.066]  In fact, people don't believe that.
[00:43:05.386 --> 00:43:10.767]  Jarren, search the term, environmental activists say trees
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.821]  Oh, I'm not joking.
[00:43:14.961 --> 00:43:16.982]  Trees are evil, too.
[00:43:17.002 --> 00:43:18.442]  Trees poison.
[00:43:31.735 --> 00:43:33.095]  But FIDO, a.k.a.
[00:43:33.115 --> 00:43:46.360]  the climate criminal, some climate change activist, and he goes on, rather than come up with solutions that could actually work, so see, oh, we do believe carbon dioxide's a deadly poison, even though plants breathe it, and then they create oxygen humans breathe.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:51.202]  We can't scare you with the word oxygen, so we'll scare you with the word carbon dioxide.
[00:43:51.702 --> 00:43:53.242]  The government cannot have my dog.
[00:43:53.583 --> 00:43:54.223]  And then it goes on.
[00:43:54.603 --> 00:43:57.624]  And this is being called for by the United Nations.
[00:44:01.027 --> 00:44:07.444]  And here in my stack, here's a Times of London, Climate Chief Lord Stern, give up meat to save the planet!
[00:44:08.206 --> 00:44:09.507]  And they're banning fireplaces.
[00:44:10.367 --> 00:44:11.508]  They're banning space heaters.
[00:44:11.768 --> 00:44:14.089]  But don't worry, California just wants to tax them.
[00:44:14.449 --> 00:44:18.531]  Oh, you can have the propane heater in Northern California on cold nights.
[00:44:18.931 --> 00:44:20.032]  You're just going to pay a tax.
[00:44:20.092 --> 00:44:23.654]  And we're going to come in your house with local inspectors that get part of the money.
[00:44:23.914 --> 00:44:27.796]  Because these little chicken-neck control freaks, they like to boss people around.
[00:44:28.536 --> 00:44:30.517]  These were the Tattletail Rats in school.
[00:44:31.257 --> 00:44:33.098]  And they are getting SWAT teams.
[00:44:33.138 --> 00:44:35.179]  And if you don't like it, they're going to murder you and your family.
[00:44:35.519 --> 00:44:36.560]  After all, you're bad for the Earth.
[00:44:37.725 --> 00:44:42.809]  People will need to turn vegetarian in if the world is to conquer climate change according to leading authority on global warming.
[00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:44.230]  And it's being proposed.
[00:44:45.251 --> 00:44:46.332]  In fact, they've already started.
[00:44:46.672 --> 00:44:48.374]  Canada's now taxing cows.
[00:44:48.394 --> 00:44:51.216]  In fact, Google that.
[00:44:52.377 --> 00:44:55.780]  Canada... Just Google a tax on cows.
[00:44:56.581 --> 00:45:00.724]  A lot of sheep farmers and beef farmers in New Zealand and Australia are just stopping.
[00:45:01.444 --> 00:45:02.726]  Hundreds of dollars per cow.
[00:45:03.406 --> 00:45:05.448]  Fifty-something dollars to seventy-plus dollars.
[00:45:09.727 --> 00:45:10.227]  Oh, look at that.
[00:45:10.367 --> 00:45:12.228]  They'd shoot trees, wouldn't they?
[00:45:12.608 --> 00:45:15.389]  Climate law encourages deforestation, scientists say.
[00:45:16.149 --> 00:45:18.350]  A law of unintended consequences strikes again.
[00:45:20.731 --> 00:45:21.891]  The Kyoto Protocol.
[00:45:22.492 --> 00:45:27.974]  And then it gets into, I guess, how trees are evil, but that's not the exact headline I wanted.
[00:45:29.854 --> 00:45:31.535]  And this is meant to be outrageous.
[00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:35.976]  And then you're a criminal if you deny that it's happening.
[00:45:36.056 --> 00:45:36.437]  You're bad.
[00:45:37.822 --> 00:45:39.823]  If you deny that this is going on.
[00:45:39.883 --> 00:45:42.844]  You are evil if you deny that this is going on.
[00:45:42.884 --> 00:45:43.724]  You are wrong.
[00:45:44.204 --> 00:45:45.104]  You are racist.
[00:45:45.224 --> 00:45:46.705]  Oh, I don't like big government.
[00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:47.285]  Racist.
[00:45:47.925 --> 00:45:49.206]  Oh, I don't think we should have open borders.
[00:45:49.266 --> 00:45:49.706]  Racist.
[00:45:50.046 --> 00:45:51.226]  I don't want government-run healthcare.
[00:45:51.246 --> 00:45:51.566]  Racist.
[00:45:51.586 --> 00:45:55.828]  I was watching some congresswoman back there in the break room earlier when I was getting some java.
[00:45:56.767 --> 00:46:05.650]  And she was on there saying, there's a woman waiting for a heart transplant and she won't get it, and there's a girl waiting for a kidney transplant and she won't get it because of this blah blah.
[00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:10.212]  England, Australia, Canada, they all have longer waiting lists for these things than the United States.
[00:46:10.472 --> 00:46:12.153]  We have one of the fastest systems in the world.
[00:46:12.653 --> 00:46:13.473]  It's not perfect.
[00:46:14.333 --> 00:46:20.956]  I was on the radio this morning on another talk show and the talk show was like, yeah, but the insurance companies, they don't want the government healthcare.
[00:46:22.076 --> 00:46:24.117]  The insurance companies wrote the stinking thing.
[00:46:25.188 --> 00:46:26.508]  See, everything is the opposite.
[00:46:27.429 --> 00:46:31.930]  The big oil companies wrote the carbon tax laws.
[00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.530]  They want it.
[00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:34.730]  They want to shut down their competition cold.
[00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:36.151]  That's on record.
[00:46:36.951 --> 00:46:39.911]  Just look at all the advertisements in the newspapers and magazines and TV.
[00:46:40.212 --> 00:46:41.832]  From BP and ExxonMobil.
[00:46:42.472 --> 00:46:45.993]  And Dutch Royal Shell calling for carbon taxes.
[00:46:46.333 --> 00:46:47.893]  I was in the airport in Los Angeles.
[00:46:48.253 --> 00:46:54.475]  Half the billboards in the concourse were about carbon taxes and it was all oil companies and computer companies pushing it.
[00:46:56.527 --> 00:46:58.054]  We'll be right back with more news.
[00:46:58.557 --> 00:47:00.004]  Your calls and Lindsey Williams.
[00:47:00.044 --> 00:47:00.486]  Stay with us.

[00:48:01.533 --> 00:48:03.556]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:48:03.716 --> 00:48:04.498]  Spy on me?
[00:48:04.578 --> 00:48:04.858]  Yeah.
[00:48:04.898 --> 00:48:09.826]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:48:09.946 --> 00:48:11.428]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:48:11.568 --> 00:48:12.229]  Startpage?
[00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:12.650]  Yeah.
[00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:13.732]  Startpage.com.
[00:48:13.832 --> 00:48:16.576]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:48:16.776 --> 00:48:20.500]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.

[00:48:23.784 --> 00:48:26.146]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the Internet.

[00:49:03.232 --> 00:49:04.234]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:49:04.634 --> 00:49:10.121]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:11.182]  That's right.
[00:49:11.502 --> 00:49:13.785]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:49:14.106 --> 00:49:21.274]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:49:21.835 --> 00:49:29.523]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:49:29.963 --> 00:49:34.828]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:49:35.448 --> 00:49:40.453]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:49:41.274 --> 00:49:45.378]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[00:50:01.632 --> 00:50:02.172]  You worry.
[00:50:02.532 --> 00:50:04.254]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:50:04.594 --> 00:50:06.816]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:50:07.256 --> 00:50:09.018]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:50:10.097 --> 00:50:10.977]  I think so.
[00:50:31.809 --> 00:50:39.971]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.

[00:50:54.675 --> 00:50:56.416]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:51:03.669 --> 00:51:31.936]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown I live back in the woods, you see I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and me
[00:51:37.077 --> 00:51:42.762]  I've got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive, and a country boy can survive.
[00:51:42.922 --> 00:51:45.564]  Yeah, country boys are putting fluoride in your water now.
[00:51:45.584 --> 00:51:47.166]  Brain damage in you.
[00:51:47.786 --> 00:51:49.568]  Gonna stand up against that?
[00:51:49.588 --> 00:51:54.832]  I can plow a field all day long.
[00:51:54.912 --> 00:51:55.813]  I can catch catfish.
[00:51:57.383 --> 00:51:59.525]  But can you keep your kids off Prozac and Ritalin?
[00:52:00.085 --> 00:52:00.966]  I've seen the statistics.
[00:52:01.006 --> 00:52:05.569]  They put more kids out in the country in this nation on drugs than anybody else.
[00:52:05.669 --> 00:52:08.011]  These country folks worship their doctors.
[00:52:08.071 --> 00:52:10.013]  You're going to wake up to that?
[00:52:10.033 --> 00:52:21.122]  I want to play three minutes from my film, Follow the Republic, right now.
[00:52:21.142 --> 00:52:24.124]  But first, we've got to crank this part up, right here.
[00:52:24.804 --> 00:52:26.386]  Because you can't make us run.
[00:52:29.274 --> 00:52:45.477]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to a clip from Foal the Republic dealing with Barack Obama becoming the chairman of the UN Security Council.
[00:52:45.497 --> 00:52:47.877]  For anybody out there who's in denial, here it is.
[00:52:49.037 --> 00:52:58.019]  The finance heads of the 20 industrialized nations met again in late September of 2009 at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[00:53:00.413 --> 00:53:06.255]  At that meeting, ministers called for an end to the dollar as the world reserve currency.
[00:53:08.396 --> 00:53:13.998]  They also called for a strengthening of global governance and called for a new world order.
[00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:31.164]  While the bankers were busy carving up the world at the G20 Summit, Barack Obama was in New York City at the United Nations because he's got a new job to chair the United Nations Security Council, the most powerful position in the world government body.
[00:53:31.724 --> 00:53:33.646]  President Obama does what no other U.S.
[00:53:33.686 --> 00:53:35.087]  president ever has.
[00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.730]  President Obama presided over the U.N.'
[00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:40.131]  's most powerful body.
[00:53:40.451 --> 00:53:43.551]  That would be the Security Council.
[00:53:44.352 --> 00:53:45.852]  6,191st meeting of the Security Council.
[00:53:45.932 --> 00:53:50.093]  For a couple of hours, you could say Mr. Obama was president of the world.
[00:53:50.393 --> 00:53:54.854]  It is the story of a world that understands that no difference or division is worth destroying.
[00:53:55.014 --> 00:54:00.415]  All that we have built in my own country, it has brought Democrats and Republican leaders together.
[00:54:01.255 --> 00:54:07.442]  Leaders like George Shultz, Bill Perry, Henry Kissinger and Sam Nunn, who are with us here today.
[00:54:07.862 --> 00:54:12.527]  Barack Obama is the first president to hold two posts simultaneously.
[00:54:13.007 --> 00:54:14.168]  And there's a good reason for that.
[00:54:14.689 --> 00:54:15.310]  It's illegal.
[00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:19.754]  Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution forbids any U.S.
[00:54:19.794 --> 00:54:22.377]  president from serving any foreign government
[00:54:22.637 --> 00:54:23.438]  Or institution.
[00:54:23.738 --> 00:54:28.062]  He swears an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[00:54:28.483 --> 00:54:34.429]  But now Barack Obama has sworn allegiance to the global government and the United Nations that he heads up.
[00:54:35.501 --> 00:54:37.263]  Let that sink in real good.
[00:54:37.964 --> 00:54:42.368]  Barack Obama now heads the United Nations Security Council.
[00:54:43.029 --> 00:54:45.792]  You cannot serve two masters, and Obama isn't.
[00:54:46.232 --> 00:54:50.637]  He's selling out the last vestiges of sovereignty that this country had.
[00:54:51.357 --> 00:54:55.502]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the destruction of our nation, and it's also high treason.
[00:54:59.969 --> 00:55:02.650]  Obama's lies are obvious and out in the open.
[00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:04.491]  He hides in plain sight.
[00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:08.573]  And from the moment he took office, his lies have only increased.
[00:55:08.993 --> 00:55:18.697]  Despite the fact that his ratings have dramatically dropped since election day, from the mid 80s to the low 40s, a large portion of Americans still gullibly hang on his every word.
[00:55:20.038 --> 00:55:23.239]  It is bringing entertainment to thousands of people.
[00:55:23.459 --> 00:55:29.262]  Through its magic, we are able to enjoy a combination of the radio, motion pictures, and the stage,
[00:55:30.291 --> 00:55:32.052]  Right in the comfort of our own homes.
[00:55:33.173 --> 00:55:36.356]  Simply by pushing a button and turning a dial.
[00:55:37.536 --> 00:55:43.841]  These cells with their electrical charges are scanned by a stream of electrons, completing 30 pictures a second.
[00:55:45.582 --> 00:55:49.205]  Compare that crude picture with these of today.
[00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:55.429]  And you can judge for yourself how far along the road to perfection television has traveled.
[00:55:55.930 --> 00:56:05.856]  Most people still today think that all entertainment to do with movies, drama, is there for nothing more than their entertainment.
[00:56:06.236 --> 00:56:07.717]  It never ever was that case.
[00:56:08.377 --> 00:56:13.840]  Of course, television can't perform such miracles as this, yet.
[00:56:15.021 --> 00:56:17.763]  But perhaps there's no harm wishing that it could.
[00:56:19.864 --> 00:56:27.069]  The greatest social messages are promoted through movies and drama, high drama... Alright.
[00:56:27.089 --> 00:56:38.898]  ...through the fixation of emotive sequences... Yeah, they knew men ran society at the local level, and the state didn't want that, so the messages about TV and culture were, men, you're in charge, the women are your slaves.
[00:56:39.518 --> 00:56:47.964]  That was the message in the 50s, and the CIA has declassified, it was meant to enrage women to then rebel in the 60s so they could break the family up.
[00:56:48.624 --> 00:56:49.285]  Now they've done it.
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:55.005]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:56:55.946 --> 00:56:58.630]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:00.879 --> 00:57:10.705]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[00:57:10.985 --> 00:57:12.386]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:57:12.606 --> 00:57:13.307]  It's very real.
[00:57:13.687 --> 00:57:14.007]  I know.
[00:57:14.027 --> 00:57:17.889]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:20.991]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:57:21.472 --> 00:57:29.697]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecola Blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[00:57:30.117 --> 00:57:36.540]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:45.025]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:57:45.525 --> 00:57:50.207]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:57:50.227 --> 00:57:50.447]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:51.588]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web.
[00:57:57.791 --> 00:58:00.532]  At E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com today.
[00:58:00.812 --> 00:58:05.033]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:05.353 --> 00:58:09.414]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:09.694 --> 00:58:15.056]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:15.436 --> 00:58:15.876]  It's true.
[00:58:16.176 --> 00:58:21.599]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:21.879 --> 00:58:25.141]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:58:25.461 --> 00:58:29.923]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:58:30.163 --> 00:58:32.545]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:58:32.925 --> 00:58:36.267]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:37.387 --> 00:58:41.310]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:46.314]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:58:46.595 --> 00:58:50.618]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:50.778 --> 00:58:52.339]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:57.163]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:00.706 --> 00:59:08.149]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:59:08.429 --> 00:59:14.231]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:59:14.511 --> 00:59:17.212]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:59:17.473 --> 00:59:23.395]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:59:23.755 --> 00:59:27.618]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:59:27.818 --> 00:59:33.223]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy, and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:59:33.443 --> 00:59:35.264]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:59:35.524 --> 00:59:36.926]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:59:37.286 --> 00:59:39.528]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:59:39.808 --> 00:59:44.171]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:59:44.532 --> 00:59:47.914]  Go to hereiswhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:59:48.255 --> 00:59:50.396]  Again, it is hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:59:51.357 --> 00:59:52.778]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:59:53.259 --> 00:59:53.899]  One last time.
[00:59:54.279 --> 00:59:55.861]  It's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:00:09.512 --> 01:00:11.554]  The Republic is falling now.
[01:00:12.634 --> 01:00:16.417]  Open world government is being heralded from the rooftops.
[01:00:16.878 --> 01:00:17.719]  You are being told
[01:00:18.632 --> 01:00:22.973]  That what you eat, everything you do, your dog, your cat, it's all going to be taxed.
[01:00:23.113 --> 01:00:24.073]  You're going to be taxed.
[01:00:24.453 --> 01:00:25.854]  You are a climate criminal.
[01:00:26.274 --> 01:00:28.674]  Carbon dioxide is a deadly chemical weapon.
[01:00:30.035 --> 01:00:31.135]  Trees are now evil.
[01:00:32.155 --> 01:00:46.839]  The globalists want it to be nonsensical and insane and have people parroting it as they dump toxic waste in the rivers and clear-cut and genetic engineer with cross-species and plant it everywhere as they inoculate and mutate the population with chemical and bioweapons.
[01:00:48.422 --> 01:00:50.104]  We're going to go to Lindsey Williams in the next hour.
[01:00:50.184 --> 01:00:51.606]  I know we have callers already holding.
[01:00:52.307 --> 01:00:52.948]  That doesn't matter.
[01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:56.513]  Because Lindsey can speak about any issue.
[01:00:57.134 --> 01:00:59.917]  We're going to take nothing but calls for Lindsey Williams in the next hour.
[01:01:00.796 --> 01:01:01.977]  That's why we have him back here.
[01:01:01.997 --> 01:01:07.582]  I'm going to briefly recap that in a moment, and we're going directly to Lindsey Williams for the next hour.
[01:01:07.602 --> 01:01:13.266]  Then I got a news blitz in the last 30 minutes today on the economy and the dollar and the police state issues I haven't gotten to.
[01:01:13.727 --> 01:01:20.172]  I did just spend the last 20 minutes or so, as promised, getting into the global government and the global carbon taxes that are being announced.
[01:01:20.473 --> 01:01:24.156]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about the sponsors that made today's show possible.
[01:01:25.469 --> 01:01:27.433]  I want to let you know about Diginet.net.
[01:01:27.513 --> 01:01:29.657]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:01:30.218 --> 01:01:33.063]  They have a whole bunch of great units, like a hidden video pin.
[01:01:34.099 --> 01:01:35.260]  Or you just press one button.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.282]  It's the ease of use that's so key with these.
[01:01:37.822 --> 01:01:41.064]  And it records hours and hours, depending on which unit you get, two to four hours.
[01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:46.489]  It has one to two channels available and records video and audio.
[01:01:46.589 --> 01:01:48.610]  Great for use with the police and others.
[01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.492]  So there's a true record of what happened.
[01:01:50.752 --> 01:01:56.436]  So they beat you almost half to death and then say that you were really Al Qaeda and that you sprouted vampire fangs and venom.
[01:01:56.977 --> 01:01:58.898]  You're going to have the evidence that that didn't really happen.
[01:01:59.259 --> 01:02:02.061]  Diginet.net, they have hidden camera sunglasses.
[01:02:02.601 --> 01:02:05.942]  It's all solid state, little bitty chip in them, and a little hidden camera.
[01:02:05.962 --> 01:02:08.363]  888-344-6681.
[01:02:08.383 --> 01:02:08.623]  888-344-6681.
[01:02:08.643 --> 01:02:12.844]  Diginet.net, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:13.244 --> 01:02:15.345]  Check them out today.
[01:02:16.685 --> 01:02:18.625]  Also, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:02:18.665 --> 01:02:20.386]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:21.946]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:25.087]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[01:02:25.107 --> 01:02:28.968]  The solar power generator has been available for some time, and our listeners love it.
[01:02:29.308 --> 01:02:31.489]  From our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:39.653]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the power source, 800 watt generator, and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:02:40.053 --> 01:02:45.715]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:02:46.076 --> 01:02:48.397]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[01:02:48.777 --> 01:02:51.618]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:58.141]  MySolarBackup.com, that's MySolarBackup.com, one word, or give the great folks at MySolarBackup.com a call, 877-327-0368.
[01:03:01.863 --> 01:03:02.163]  Five.
[01:03:02.844 --> 01:03:05.425]  Okay, let me just recap.
[01:03:05.505 --> 01:03:13.369]  Lindsey Williams broke on this radio show last Monday, Tuesday, and Friday in successive one-hour interviews.
[01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:22.754]  The inside scoop from a former major top ten oil company executive that he got to know when he worked with him decades ago.
[01:03:23.254 --> 01:03:27.297]  Lindsey had the number one video on YouTube and Google off and on for months.
[01:03:27.897 --> 01:03:29.198]  Every week it was in the top ten.
[01:03:30.649 --> 01:03:38.934]  Tens of millions of views as he presented how there was enough oil to run the United States over and over and over again, a lot more than Saudi Arabia.
[01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:42.836]  He talked about that 20-something years ago with his best-selling book, The Energy Non-Crisis.
[01:03:43.497 --> 01:03:46.118]  And the guy called up and said, look, you're going to die.
[01:03:46.178 --> 01:03:49.701]  We're going to basically kill you if you don't shut up about this.
[01:03:49.801 --> 01:03:51.262]  But you can tell your people this.
[01:03:52.122 --> 01:03:57.125]  How they were going to lower oil prices from 150 a barrel to below 50 for the next year, and that indeed did happen.
[01:03:57.465 --> 01:04:05.110]  Lindsey got laughed at at the time when oil was at $147 when he premiered that information on Dr. Stan Monteith and then my show.
[01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:14.375]  Now, he talked to this gentleman who almost died recently, again, a couple weeks ago, and he broke the news here on our radio show.
[01:04:14.395 --> 01:04:19.198]  We're very thankful for that, and I believe his story, and it fits in with all the MO I already have from their open announcements.
[01:04:20.451 --> 01:04:25.895]  But I want listeners to get a chance to ask your questions of Lindsey Williams.
[01:04:25.915 --> 01:04:28.898]  So, I know Vanessa, Victor, Amber, Dayton, Derek, everybody.
[01:04:28.958 --> 01:04:31.920]  I know you were already there before he came on.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:32.480]  Doesn't matter.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.341]  He can talk about all the issues.
[01:04:33.361 --> 01:04:34.622]  He's been fighting the Globals for decades.
[01:04:35.322 --> 01:04:38.645]  Because he worked in and around them and with them, so he found out about it back in the 70s.
[01:04:38.705 --> 01:04:40.927]  We're going to have open phones.
[01:04:40.967 --> 01:04:44.649]  As soon as you hear a caller hang up, you can call in with your question only for Lindsey Williams.
[01:04:45.435 --> 01:04:45.695]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:45.775 --> 01:04:50.540]  Make your point quickly because we're going to the next person.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.082]  Lindsey Williams, good to have you back on with us.
[01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:57.626]  Alex, thank you for allowing me the privilege of being on your show this morning.
[01:04:57.666 --> 01:05:02.110]  Now, just before we went on air, I went on my computer to YouTube.
[01:05:02.845 --> 01:05:04.586]  Congratulations, Alex.
[01:05:05.006 --> 01:05:10.890]  The most watched video on YouTube this morning, this hour, is Fall of the Republic.
[01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:16.012]  Alex, if anybody in America is ever going to turn this country around, it's going to be Alex Jones.
[01:05:16.473 --> 01:05:17.733]  Congratulations.
[01:05:17.874 --> 01:05:18.854]  I am so proud of you.
[01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:19.735]  I don't know what to do.
[01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:21.636]  I have watched your Fall of the Republic.
[01:05:22.156 --> 01:05:24.737]  Every person has got to get a copy of it.
[01:05:25.098 --> 01:05:29.140]  Copy it a thousand times, folks, and give it out to everybody you know.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.841]  Alex, congratulations.
[01:05:31.206 --> 01:05:32.026]  Well, thank you, Lindsey.
[01:05:32.466 --> 01:05:41.949]  Yes, there are two director accounts, Change the Channel and one other, that have the full version uploaded, and I tell listeners that, and we're going to do a big promotion next week, promoting, getting it out to everybody.
[01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:45.211]  Maybe now is the time, because I did see it was already number one, I didn't mention that.
[01:05:45.711 --> 01:05:46.631]  That's just one version.
[01:05:46.671 --> 01:05:48.412]  There are over a thousand versions.
[01:05:48.452 --> 01:05:53.793]  If you Google, Follow the Republic, there's over, that was last night, a thousand versions of it, with 10,000, 100,000, 300,000, 400,000, 200,000.
[01:05:54.113 --> 01:05:54.614]  It's already
[01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:03.078]  Several million last night, and I had like five minutes and counted up a few of the big ones.
[01:06:03.579 --> 01:06:07.142]  So, in five, six days, we launched it last Wednesday, so that's six days.
[01:06:07.762 --> 01:06:10.345]  Millions and millions, it's over two million views, conservatively.
[01:06:11.025 --> 01:06:13.047]  Very, very exciting with all the different versions.
[01:06:13.407 --> 01:06:16.950]  A straw man attack will be, well this one only says 300,000, this one only says 200,000.
[01:06:17.271 --> 01:06:18.071]  It's all of them together.
[01:06:18.832 --> 01:06:19.472]  Over 2 million.
[01:06:20.053 --> 01:06:27.816]  And like Obama deception, you'll go see 4 million here, a million there, 2 million here, half a million there, 100,000 here.
[01:06:28.116 --> 01:06:31.198]  It's over 20 million, just from what I've counted, months ago.
[01:06:31.898 --> 01:06:33.439]  But that's Obama deception.
[01:06:33.679 --> 01:06:34.499]  So thank you, Lindsey.
[01:06:34.519 --> 01:06:35.860]  And I want to say this to you, Pastor.
[01:06:37.079 --> 01:06:40.460]  And we've got to hurry and go to calls, that's what we promised to have you here for today, and we're very blessed to have you.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:48.462]  Maybe you could stay a little bit longer than past the half hour, though I have a news blitz coming up, so we can get to more of these, because I'm already going to you late here, but I wanted to say this.
[01:06:49.102 --> 01:06:52.283]  The New World Order has created a counterfeit of Christianity.
[01:06:52.723 --> 01:07:02.046]  A Christianoid, as my uncle calls it, fake Christianity, of all the little glitter bugs and the rest of them up there on the screen, as Jack McClam calls them, to discredit
[01:07:03.334 --> 01:07:05.456]  Real Christianity, and the teachings of Jesus.
[01:07:06.016 --> 01:07:16.104]  And you look at everything being fulfilled in prophecy, you look at all the reality, and the great delusion how folks wouldn't know it was the Antichrist when it came because of the rap, you know, just all this propaganda.
[01:07:16.644 --> 01:07:24.390]  But I want to say this, God has really been working with me to be more focused, more professional, because I do have this great responsibility and I do recognize
[01:07:25.677 --> 01:07:36.587]  That unfortunately it's a very dangerous position because they have tried to set me up and destroy me and I cheerfully take my licks, whatever they are, that I am the greatest threat to the New World Order.
[01:07:36.627 --> 01:07:38.649]  It's a crazy statement, but it's true.
[01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:41.391]  Because my listeners are the greatest threat to the New World Order.
[01:07:41.911 --> 01:07:42.772]  Next to Ron Paul.
[01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:44.554]  We're right up there with Ron Paul.
[01:07:44.574 --> 01:07:46.415]  Kind of twin peaks, as they say.
[01:07:47.532 --> 01:07:56.725]  And I've been praying every night to help me be more articulate, to help me be more honorable, to help me not be as worldly, to help me not be as obnoxious, to help me not lose my temper.
[01:07:57.286 --> 01:08:00.430]  And I just am overwhelmed in saying, why me, God?
[01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:03.754]  But the discernment and everything God's opened up to me
[01:08:04.881 --> 01:08:08.566]  It's a great comfort but also very painful to be able to understand what's happening.
[01:08:08.606 --> 01:08:09.748]  I know you're a lot older than I am.
[01:08:10.068 --> 01:08:12.511]  A pastor who's been fighting the globalists for almost 30 years.
[01:08:14.594 --> 01:08:20.482]  It's just amazing when you turn yourself over to God and just say, God help me be a vessel, a tool to fight tyranny.
[01:08:20.983 --> 01:08:22.004]  What God has done with
[01:08:22.805 --> 01:08:24.486]  Alex, I'm so proud of you.
[01:08:24.506 --> 01:08:25.006]  You can't imagine.
[01:08:25.066 --> 01:08:27.187]  When I heard, only days ago, from the elite.
[01:08:27.207 --> 01:08:30.868]  Now, you didn't use the word elite a moment ago, but I'm going to use it now.
[01:08:52.870 --> 01:09:05.678]  When I heard from one of them just a few days ago and what he said, everything you're doing, what you just got through saying, he said within two years we will not recognize America.
[01:09:06.038 --> 01:09:07.999]  Time is of the essence.
[01:09:08.559 --> 01:09:15.964]  Again, this elite told me after two years you will be so poor you will not be able to do anything.
[01:09:17.445 --> 01:09:18.465]  This is startling.
[01:09:18.966 --> 01:09:20.927]  He went on down to talk about
[01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:24.280]  2012, the dollar will be dead.
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.961]  We're talking two years.
[01:09:26.542 --> 01:09:30.365]  Again, he said war is planned after two years.
[01:09:30.885 --> 01:09:36.250]  He said inflation is going to escalate over a period of two years.
[01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:45.357]  And then the elite made it very plain that they have used this term, devil's messiah, of a system.
[01:09:47.302 --> 01:09:50.585]  All of these things the Elite have planned, they know what they're doing.
[01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:59.132]  Let me stress, as powerful as I possibly can, there positively is a group of people out there that control the world.
[01:09:59.553 --> 01:10:02.235]  Everything you've heard on the Alex Jones Show is true.
[01:10:02.675 --> 01:10:08.801]  I only have the privilege of being on every now and then, but what Alex says every single day, I can back it up.
[01:10:08.961 --> 01:10:12.664]  I lived, I was the chaplain for the Elite for three years.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.941]  On the Trans Alaska Oil Pipeline.
[01:10:15.101 --> 01:10:17.081]  I lived with these people for three years.
[01:10:17.401 --> 01:10:19.562]  Very few people even get to know one of them.
[01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:23.783]  But by the providence of God, I had the privilege of living with them.
[01:10:24.023 --> 01:10:27.844]  Everything Alex Jones says about these people is true.
[01:10:28.044 --> 01:10:28.384]  I know.
[01:10:28.404 --> 01:10:29.144]  I lived it.
[01:10:29.284 --> 01:10:29.765]  I saw it.
[01:10:30.145 --> 01:10:31.985]  I sat across the dinner table from them.
[01:10:32.085 --> 01:10:33.626]  Alex, I am so proud of you.
[01:10:34.166 --> 01:10:35.066]  I don't know what to say.
[01:10:35.146 --> 01:10:36.846]  I just wish... No, I'm proud of you.
[01:10:37.026 --> 01:10:42.208]  And, Pastor, I'm actually humbled because I've tried to whitewash
[01:10:43.325 --> 01:10:47.507]  Paper over how important the position I'm in because I don't want that.
[01:10:47.547 --> 01:10:48.968]  I don't have this high view of myself.
[01:10:49.449 --> 01:10:52.991]  And I know that it's not Alex Jones that's helped wake up all these people.
[01:10:53.351 --> 01:10:55.972]  It was God working through me and my great listeners.
[01:10:56.593 --> 01:11:00.235]  And we're involved in the most important thing that we could be.
[01:11:00.355 --> 01:11:04.137]  I've got the most important job that anybody could have.
[01:11:04.217 --> 01:11:06.158]  You have the most important job anybody could have.
[01:11:07.499 --> 01:11:08.760]  A old washerwoman
[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:14.161]  Talking to her neighbors about the New World Order and about global tax has the most important job.
[01:11:14.501 --> 01:11:18.883]  We are fighting pure, unadulterated death.
[01:11:19.183 --> 01:11:20.343]  Total destruction.
[01:11:20.703 --> 01:11:21.843]  Kill, steal and destroy.
[01:11:21.923 --> 01:11:22.664]  That is the enemy.
[01:11:22.924 --> 01:11:23.924]  Kill, steal and destroy.
[01:11:24.604 --> 01:11:25.925]  That's like a big robot.
[01:11:26.185 --> 01:11:27.405]  Kill, steal, destroy.
[01:11:27.705 --> 01:11:29.185]  That's what eco-science says.
[01:11:29.246 --> 01:11:30.626]  That's what the globalists are pushing.
[01:11:31.126 --> 01:11:32.566]  Let's go to phone calls, Lindsey.
[01:11:33.847 --> 01:11:34.427]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:11:34.827 --> 01:11:35.107]  You bet.
[01:11:35.227 --> 01:11:35.948]  Good to have you here.
[01:11:36.268 --> 01:11:38.810]  Vanessa, you can address myself or Lindsey, but let's move quickly.
[01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:40.251]  Vanessa, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:11:41.271 --> 01:11:41.892]  Hi, Alex.
[01:11:42.012 --> 01:11:44.793]  It's such an honor to speak with you and Lindsey today.
[01:11:44.813 --> 01:11:47.615]  So happy to be able to speak with you.
[01:11:47.655 --> 01:11:49.036]  Well, it's an honor to speak with you.
[01:11:49.056 --> 01:11:49.897]  Ma'am, go ahead.
[01:11:50.817 --> 01:11:55.801]  Well, thank you for shifting my paradigm, and it's made me a better parent and a better patriot.
[01:11:55.921 --> 01:12:03.125]  And I just want you to know that I'm going to be giving out copies of your Fall of the Republic to every trick-or-treater at my door this Halloween.
[01:12:03.425 --> 01:12:04.066]  That's a good idea.
[01:12:05.002 --> 01:12:11.185]  Yes, along with some information about the flu vaccine and I understand this is a little bit off topic.
[01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:12.526]  I was on hold before.
[01:12:12.946 --> 01:12:13.387]  No, it's not.
[01:12:13.447 --> 01:12:13.807]  Go ahead.
[01:12:13.847 --> 01:12:16.528]  Lindsay can comment on this.
[01:12:16.688 --> 01:12:21.051]  Okay, I just wanted to know what your opinion was of this or your thoughts.
[01:12:21.551 --> 01:12:23.772]  It's really disturbing to me.
[01:12:24.453 --> 01:12:28.074]  Our school district in the area is performing reverse 911 type calls.
[01:12:29.887 --> 01:12:30.127]  Yes.
[01:12:30.808 --> 01:12:47.098]  They call up and tell you, we had an incident at the school today, or a storm may be coming, and the feds reported in the late 80s they want to have all of us, where radios, TVs, even if they're not plugged in, they have transponders in them, by law they're beginning to put in them, where they're going to take over and make announcements.
[01:12:48.078 --> 01:12:51.920]  Yes, and they're promoting the free vaccines for public high schools.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:56.223]  So you're getting automated phone calls, or are they having human beings call you?
[01:12:56.343 --> 01:12:59.145]  No, they are automated, and they're calling cell phones too.
[01:12:59.864 --> 01:13:01.165]  Robot calls, man.
[01:13:01.385 --> 01:13:18.039]  Yes, and I just, it's really scary and the last thing I want to say, and I'll let you go because I know you've got a lot of people to get to, they had a military helicopter land in our local elementary school's playground during school hours and made it part of an assembly.
[01:13:18.679 --> 01:13:20.741]  Brought the kids out there, they were armed.
[01:13:22.014 --> 01:13:24.477]  And it sounds reasonable, but it's done to acclimate.
[01:13:24.897 --> 01:13:32.245]  Anderson High, where I graduated in 1993, they had an Army Reserve General, was the principal.
[01:13:33.207 --> 01:13:42.977]  And the year after I left, Roger Raessler, the younger brother of Alex and Nate Raessler, became a U2 football player, good friend of mine, he called me and said,
[01:13:43.956 --> 01:13:47.959]  Because I was already talking about the New World Order by the time I was a freshman in college.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.061]  He said, you wouldn't believe it, Alex.
[01:13:50.681 --> 01:13:57.787]  They landed a helicopter and announced over the school, and this happened my last day of school too, or two days before, they landed a Cobra.
[01:13:58.328 --> 01:14:00.870]  But they said, they announced, this is your New World Order.
[01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:05.633]  And they had Marines take over, Hobbs Middle School, Pensacola, Florida, we have those articles.
[01:14:07.074 --> 01:14:13.097]  1998, and then the Marines took over the classrooms and said, the President wants you to know what martial law is like.
[01:14:13.117 --> 01:14:24.443]  In fact, guys, search engine, InfoWars.com, Helicopters Anderson High, Black Helicopter Anderson High, something like that.
[01:14:24.463 --> 01:14:31.466]  You'll see photos that we posted, because not only did Roger Raessler call me,
[01:14:34.415 --> 01:14:42.020]  But, then, I got sent photos years later of it happening again.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:45.222]  I'm now remembering the whole story, but thank you for the call.
[01:14:45.242 --> 01:14:45.922]  I appreciate it.
[01:14:46.703 --> 01:14:50.145]  Lindsey Williams, your comment on the acclamation of the military taking over America?
[01:14:50.966 --> 01:14:52.467]  Your latest talk with me about this.
[01:14:52.647 --> 01:14:54.608]  I am so glad your caller brought this up.
[01:14:54.648 --> 01:14:56.589]  They call it the Devil's Messiah.
[01:14:56.609 --> 01:14:57.710]  Now, they have a word for it.
[01:14:58.363 --> 01:14:59.964]  Normally, you probably wouldn't hear this.
[01:15:00.084 --> 01:15:02.986]  It goes all the way back to what they've done to our schools.
[01:15:03.526 --> 01:15:06.528]  It goes to the humanism that was brought in by evolution.
[01:15:07.008 --> 01:15:08.990]  They have subverted the churches.
[01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:09.970]  Oh, my goodness!
[01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:18.356]  And my new DVD set, I talk about what is done to the churches because I've been a pastor for 50 years or minister of the gospel, so I go into that.
[01:15:18.876 --> 01:15:22.698]  Every bit of this is a part of what the latest talk with me about.
[01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:25.460]  I think I dealt with part of this on your program last week.
[01:15:25.894 --> 01:15:27.535]  So, how far you'd like us to go?
[01:15:28.636 --> 01:15:29.097]  They did.
[01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:31.238]  This is their program.
[01:15:34.141 --> 01:15:34.941]  We'll continue.
[01:15:35.001 --> 01:15:36.322]  Let's get to some more of the calls, though.
[01:15:36.343 --> 01:15:36.883]  That's important.
[01:15:36.903 --> 01:15:40.866]  The total takeover of society through the schools and churches, that's been declassified.
[01:15:41.226 --> 01:15:43.588]  Victor in California, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[01:15:44.569 --> 01:15:45.150]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:46.050]  Good.
[01:15:46.411 --> 01:15:46.651]  Alex?
[01:15:47.892 --> 01:15:48.092]  Yes?
[01:15:48.152 --> 01:15:48.773]  I'm Victor.
[01:15:48.953 --> 01:15:52.676]  I'm a veteran from Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:15:52.856 --> 01:15:54.157]  I served in Fort Bragg.
[01:15:55.791 --> 01:16:10.965]  I was just looking over this on the internet, it says The Dome, Under the Dome by Stephen King, and it was on an exclusive PopEater.com interview with him.
[01:16:12.627 --> 01:16:19.473]  And I was wondering, because I noticed that the Simpsons had The Dome on their cartoon
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.801]  And now this is coming out.
[01:16:22.362 --> 01:16:27.086]  Yes, it's predictive programming where they condition you that you've got to go under quarantine.
[01:16:27.106 --> 01:16:34.793]  They've got scores of TV shows about disaster, martial law, all so you're comfortable with it and almost expect it.
[01:16:34.833 --> 01:16:36.674]  Like, I keep hearing about this movie.
[01:16:36.754 --> 01:16:37.715]  I want to go see it now.
[01:16:38.156 --> 01:16:39.256]  So you're expecting it.
[01:16:39.276 --> 01:16:46.463]  You know, it's kind of like when you're growing up in middle school and the bully is saying, I'm going to be waiting for you when you get off the bus.
[01:16:47.745 --> 01:16:52.427]  You almost are glad when you're pulling up in the bus and you see him waiting over in the edge of the woods.
[01:16:54.408 --> 01:16:55.829]  You're almost glad to get it over with.
[01:16:55.849 --> 01:16:57.729]  You're almost glad when he finally punches you.
[01:16:58.050 --> 01:16:59.370]  Because now you can get it going.
[01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:00.891]  And that's the acclamation.
[01:17:01.331 --> 01:17:02.552]  And Lindsey talked about that.
[01:17:02.592 --> 01:17:04.893]  The Elite told him two weeks ago the same thing.
[01:17:04.913 --> 01:17:07.494]  We're using movies to condition you, Lindsey.
[01:17:08.474 --> 01:17:12.956]  Yes, they gave me a schedule of events in chronological order.
[01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:14.857]  I'm still sitting back, startled.
[01:17:15.886 --> 01:17:18.187]  I think I gave those also in your program last week.
[01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:28.849]  A schedule of events in chronological order of their countdown according to their new altered timeline of approximately two years.
[01:17:29.269 --> 01:17:31.330]  And every bit of this is planned in advance.
[01:17:31.410 --> 01:17:36.431]  And I think probably, Alex, the only reason this gentleman gave me this is because he's over 85 years of age.
[01:17:36.811 --> 01:17:38.311]  He almost died last winter.
[01:17:38.931 --> 01:17:41.652]  Once you become a part of the elite, you never get away from it.
[01:17:42.285 --> 01:17:46.069]  And by the providence of God, I've known this man now for about 30 years.
[01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:48.071]  A number of times I've talked to him on the phone.
[01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:56.580]  When he gave me this only days ago, I was utterly appalled to know the entire plan of the elite for the next few years.
[01:17:56.641 --> 01:17:57.461]  All right, stay there.
[01:17:57.481 --> 01:17:59.904]  We're going to come back to Amber, Dayton, Derek, Matt, and others.
[01:17:59.944 --> 01:18:00.364]  Stay with us.
[01:18:01.127 --> 01:18:09.532]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:18:09.832 --> 01:18:15.516]  At HempUSA.org we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[01:18:15.836 --> 01:18:22.360]  At HempUSA.org we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:18:22.924 --> 01:18:26.188]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:18:26.328 --> 01:18:28.571]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:18:28.771 --> 01:18:35.138]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:38.682]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[01:18:38.902 --> 01:18:40.704]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-
[01:18:41.505 --> 01:18:44.206]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:18:44.226 --> 01:18:45.526]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:18:45.546 --> 01:18:47.146]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:19:11.218 --> 01:19:13.880]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:19:13.901 --> 01:19:20.106]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:19:20.286 --> 01:19:25.331]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:19:25.851 --> 01:19:35.480]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.681]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:19:37.921 --> 01:19:39.262]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:19:39.522 --> 01:19:41.783]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:19:41.983 --> 01:19:43.824]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:19:44.104 --> 01:19:48.846]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:19:49.246 --> 01:19:58.371]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:00.802 --> 01:20:04.808]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[01:20:05.088 --> 01:20:07.933]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[01:20:08.353 --> 01:20:16.165]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[01:20:16.405 --> 01:20:18.327]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.609]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[01:20:21.029 --> 01:20:27.454]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[01:20:27.835 --> 01:20:33.620]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.242]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[01:20:36.622 --> 01:20:37.483]  Utopia Silver
[01:20:37.483 --> 01:20:37.963]  We're good to go.
[01:21:06.574 --> 01:21:09.175]  As promised, Lindsey Williams is here taking your calls.
[01:21:09.215 --> 01:21:15.817]  We're almost through the calls it was holding on other issues, but everything the callers bring up ties into what Lindsey's been discussing.
[01:21:16.418 --> 01:21:18.758]  Amber in New York, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:21:18.798 --> 01:21:19.239]  Go ahead.
[01:21:19.259 --> 01:21:21.139]  Hi, Alex.
[01:21:21.399 --> 01:21:27.782]  I just wanted to thank you for being so strong for everybody and leading us through this trying time in our country.
[01:21:27.802 --> 01:21:30.403]  Well, ma'am, I hope I can live up to it.
[01:21:30.463 --> 01:21:33.904]  I'm just an average person, an example of what we can all do, but go ahead.
[01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:53.526]  Um, I wanted to know if you knew anything about, um, I live in Southern New York and we have, um, these guys that pulled up a couple of weeks ago and they tagged our driveway with a big shiny address, you know, and it's on everybody's property.
[01:21:54.527 --> 01:22:02.894]  But the scarier thing is there's so much FEMA, um, posters up like at the stores on the windows and, um,
[01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:15.892]  They're just training you to see posters about spying on your neighbors, and posters how the government wants to help you, and posters how the government loves you, and half the billboards.
[01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:16.693]  I'm not exaggerating.
[01:22:16.713 --> 01:22:18.194]  I'm going to do a piece on this for YouTube.
[01:22:18.234 --> 01:22:21.415]  Drive around and go, let's just randomly drive down a road and show the billboards.
[01:22:21.695 --> 01:22:22.656]  Tattle on your neighbors.
[01:22:22.696 --> 01:22:23.756]  Tattle on your kids.
[01:22:24.417 --> 01:22:25.437]  Don't use drugs.
[01:22:26.598 --> 01:22:27.739]  The government's your boss.
[01:22:27.779 --> 01:22:28.039]  It's like 1984.
[01:22:28.139 --> 01:22:29.760]  I appreciate your call.
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:33.862]  The elite are clearly bringing in a major police state, Lindsey Williams.
[01:22:33.942 --> 01:22:34.142]  Why?
[01:22:35.157 --> 01:22:39.058]  Oh, they positively are, because the name of the game is control.
[01:22:39.158 --> 01:22:41.818]  I've said it for 35 years since I've lived with these people.
[01:22:42.758 --> 01:22:43.859]  That's all they're after.
[01:22:44.079 --> 01:22:52.200]  You know, some of the people that I was with on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline, they could have written a check for a million dollars a day for the rest of their life and never spent their fortunes.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:23:03.162]  Everything is about control of people, control of nations, control of currencies, and it's control, not necessarily just dollars and cents, even though that's a part of their program.
[01:23:03.718 --> 01:23:09.743]  And everything imaginable in our society today is geared to programming people mentally.
[01:23:10.263 --> 01:23:15.487]  It's a psychological battle to prepare them for their timeline.
[01:23:17.829 --> 01:23:18.429]  Absolutely.
[01:23:18.469 --> 01:23:20.031]  Let's go ahead and take another phone call.
[01:23:21.171 --> 01:23:23.553]  Let's speak to... Thank you, Amber.
[01:23:23.913 --> 01:23:25.435]  Dayton in Louisiana.
[01:23:25.455 --> 01:23:26.375]  You're on the air, Dayton.
[01:23:27.256 --> 01:23:32.400]  Well, I want to thank you and Linda for being patriotic and trying to help our country out of this mess we're in.
[01:23:33.112 --> 01:23:38.656]  I'm a veteran of World War II, 84 years old, and I've lived in the best days of our country.
[01:23:39.137 --> 01:23:43.660]  But some of you younger people have got to stand up, or we're going to lose everything we fought for.
[01:23:44.341 --> 01:23:48.104]  But I want to again thank both of you guys for doing what you're doing, and God bless you.
[01:23:48.985 --> 01:23:49.685]  Well, God bless you.
[01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:51.426]  Do you have any questions for Lindsey?
[01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:55.690]  Well, a lot of callers just want to thank us, and I want to explain something.
[01:23:57.062 --> 01:24:09.467]  We need your support and we appreciate it, but I need everybody just to warn the girls about how the Gardasil shot's killing them, how the flu shots are already killing and maiming people, how global government's being set up.
[01:24:10.387 --> 01:24:11.888]  I don't deserve a lot of thanks.
[01:24:12.248 --> 01:24:15.469]  How could I know this information and not warn people?
[01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:17.590]  I mean, it's common sense.
[01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:21.832]  And I'm not saying I don't like being thanked, but I mean, how do you know
[01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:29.513]  That they're putting poison in the water supply and bragging about it in government documents and not get upset, Lindsey Williams?
[01:24:30.313 --> 01:24:36.956]  Well, that's exactly the reaction I took here a few days ago when this individual gave me all this that literally shattered me.
[01:24:37.116 --> 01:24:39.157]  I mean, I was stunned.
[01:24:39.657 --> 01:24:43.559]  And the first thing that came to my mind, Alex, is just what you said just then.
[01:24:43.939 --> 01:24:51.503]  Can I, Lindsey Williams, sit here with this information told to me by one of the elite and do nothing about it?
[01:24:51.683 --> 01:24:52.203]  I said no.
[01:24:52.914 --> 01:24:57.336]  I must put my reputation on the line just as I did two years ago when you said it's going from $147 to $50.
[01:24:57.396 --> 01:25:10.261]  And I said, well, if the reputation has been established, maybe, maybe some of those people out there in America will listen to what I've got to say now on this new information.
[01:25:10.621 --> 01:25:13.823]  Yeah, same action, Alex, that you have.
[01:25:15.603 --> 01:25:17.064]  We'll be back with the final hour.
[01:25:17.084 --> 01:25:19.005]  More calls for Lindsey Williams.
[01:25:19.605 --> 01:25:20.725]  Derek in New Mexico.
[01:25:20.845 --> 01:25:21.626]  Matt in Texas.
[01:25:22.685 --> 01:25:25.807]  And many others straight ahead at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:25:28.289 --> 01:25:33.712]  Big news blitz coming up near the end of the show on a host of other economic news.
[01:25:34.233 --> 01:25:38.375]  And the Washington Times and Politico have been attacking me.
[01:25:38.455 --> 01:25:39.116]  I'll get into that.
[01:25:42.378 --> 01:25:44.219]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.122]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:25:51.775 --> 01:25:55.437]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:25:55.797 --> 01:25:58.799]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:25:59.039 --> 01:26:03.822]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:26:03.842 --> 01:26:10.065]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:26:10.225 --> 01:26:12.467]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:26:13.007 --> 01:26:13.287]  Tim Geithner?
[01:26:13.307 --> 01:26:13.727]  Bernanke?
[01:26:13.807 --> 01:26:14.588]  They're arsonists!
[01:26:14.608 --> 01:26:15.748]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:26:15.768 --> 01:26:18.009]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:26:31.894 --> 01:26:33.755]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:26:34.035 --> 01:26:38.838]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:26:39.178 --> 01:26:49.123]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:26:53.706 --> 01:26:55.627]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:56.087 --> 01:26:58.849]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:27:09.166 --> 01:27:12.068]  Lindsey Williams is our guest for another 40 minutes or so.
[01:27:13.248 --> 01:27:14.849]  He's taking your phone calls today.
[01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:21.674]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next here, John?
[01:27:23.195 --> 01:27:24.356]  Derek in New Mexico.
[01:27:24.776 --> 01:27:25.837]  Derek, you're on the air.
[01:27:25.897 --> 01:27:26.277]  Welcome.
[01:27:26.978 --> 01:27:27.358]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:27.378 --> 01:27:28.899]  I want to thank you for having me on.
[01:27:28.919 --> 01:27:30.160]  I'm not going to thank you anymore.
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:32.021]  I just wanted to get to some issues locally.
[01:27:32.521 --> 01:27:33.002]  I'm calling from...
[01:27:33.843 --> 01:27:34.844]  Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[01:27:34.884 --> 01:27:41.207]  And over here, man, it's propaganda everywhere with the DUIs, with the cops.
[01:27:41.847 --> 01:27:44.829]  If you've heard about the interlock, have you guys heard about the interlock here in New Mexico?
[01:27:45.789 --> 01:27:46.490]  Tell us about it.
[01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:53.534]  I have heard about it in other parts of the country, but the issue is it's all about their good, we're bad, all the citizens are suspect.
[01:27:53.654 --> 01:27:55.235]  Oh, we're just big kids, Alex.
[01:27:55.275 --> 01:27:57.416]  We're just big kids that need to be told what to do.
[01:27:58.236 --> 01:27:58.817]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:58.957 --> 01:28:03.279]  And I was just wondering if we as a citizen can do something like recall every
[01:28:04.183 --> 01:28:07.385]  Just like Arnold did with his little stunt, recalling everybody.
[01:28:07.405 --> 01:28:11.607]  Why can't we recall local, state, federal, everybody?
[01:28:11.647 --> 01:28:13.548]  Because they're not doing the job for us anymore.
[01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:14.108]  At all.
[01:28:14.928 --> 01:28:16.049]  Well, they don't want to do the job.
[01:28:16.089 --> 01:28:17.269]  They want to suck off of you.
[01:28:17.309 --> 01:28:18.770]  But tell folks about the interlock.
[01:28:20.551 --> 01:28:25.753]  The interlock is something that you have to put the device in your car, meaning you have to blow into it to start your vehicle.
[01:28:26.233 --> 01:28:30.155]  You drink, even though it's American, it's a free country, you want to have a drink?
[01:28:30.195 --> 01:28:32.016]  No, you're going to have to have an interlock in your car.
[01:28:32.619 --> 01:28:33.080]  You know what I mean?
[01:28:33.381 --> 01:28:36.408]  Now, I know that DUI is a problem, but they're overblowing it.
[01:28:36.428 --> 01:28:36.930]  You know what I mean?
[01:28:37.678 --> 01:28:51.810]  Yeah, they're saying they want all cars to spy on you, guilty until proven innocent, with a sensor for alcohol, guilty until proven innocent.
[01:28:51.850 --> 01:28:56.414]  And now cameras they want in all cars, if the car's too hot, a child might get in it.
[01:28:56.734 --> 01:29:01.658]  All of you have to be watched by a police camera tied in with a cell phone that digitally transmits.
[01:29:02.078 --> 01:29:04.941]  Lindsey Williams, this complete control grid,
[01:29:05.501 --> 01:29:08.902]  Face scanning cameras, license plate reading cameras, it's all going in.
[01:29:10.023 --> 01:29:18.466]  Yes, when I heard from this elite just days ago, he actually let me know that the elite are laughing at the gullible, stupid America.
[01:29:18.566 --> 01:29:22.087]  Now, forgive me folks, that's exactly what they think we are.
[01:29:22.668 --> 01:29:34.092]  And if action is not taken immediately, our children, our grandchildren, and our great-great-grandchildren will forever be slaves to the elite because they think they have it made
[01:29:34.716 --> 01:29:41.401]  I don't think they do, and it's only because of people like Alex Jones and others and Fall of the Republic.
[01:29:42.042 --> 01:29:51.489]  Oh my goodness, if ever we've got to do something, we have it now, because they have altered that timeline and they know what they're going to do and when they're going to do it.
[01:29:51.569 --> 01:29:53.170]  Alex, it's all planned.
[01:29:55.191 --> 01:29:55.772]  Absolutely.
[01:29:55.812 --> 01:29:58.294]  Let's take another call here right now.
[01:29:59.194 --> 01:30:03.017]  Let's go to Matt in Texas.
[01:30:03.117 --> 01:30:03.858]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:30:04.528 --> 01:30:11.892]  Hey Alex, Lindsey, I just wanted to say God bless the both of you, and I just want to tell you all to keep fighting the good fight.
[01:30:14.273 --> 01:30:21.256]  And we pray, you know, me and my wife pray that every day that God builds the protection, the hedge, around both of your families stronger than ever.
[01:30:22.357 --> 01:30:26.399]  And I just have a couple of quick points to make.
[01:30:26.939 --> 01:30:33.282]  I'm not going to go off into some biblical rant or anything like that, but this is addressed to Lindsey and you both, Alex.
[01:30:35.594 --> 01:30:37.275]  But this is very, very important.
[01:30:37.715 --> 01:30:44.158]  My wife and I, we've studied in the Greek and Hebrew manuscripts for many, many years now, and my point is this.
[01:30:45.639 --> 01:30:49.121]  I'm only going to mention one biblical verse, and that's all.
[01:30:49.141 --> 01:30:49.902]  Okay, we're almost out of time.
[01:30:50.022 --> 01:30:51.883]  You don't have to apologize for it, sir.
[01:30:52.443 --> 01:30:52.663]  Okay.
[01:30:53.083 --> 01:30:59.687]  In Genesis 3.15, there are two seed lines that are talked about, one being Adam's and the other being Cain's.
[01:31:00.598 --> 01:31:15.166]  And what our studies are here is that these two seed lines, the Cain seed line, also known as the Kenites, these are the global elites controlling the four hidden dynasties, the religion, the political, the financial, and the educational systems.
[01:31:15.906 --> 01:31:21.389]  And these are not these silly reptilian shapeshifters that are talked about, you know, on other programs and stuff.
[01:31:21.429 --> 01:31:22.970]  This is a real group of people.
[01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:26.652]  And all through the Bible it talks about that they're builders of cities,
[01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:42.678]  Uh, that they're the heads of states, the kings, the queens, and, uh, they're using these tools, the four hidden dynasties, once again, you know, the political, the religious, the financial, and, uh, the educational system to steer this planet into affairs.
[01:31:43.138 --> 01:31:47.160]  And I would suggest to everybody out there, it's K-E-N-I-T-E-S.
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:50.022]  Research these guys, the Kennites, they're the sons of Cain.
[01:31:51.048 --> 01:31:53.089]  And they're, they're the bad guys.
[01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:55.211]  They're the ones that are controlling... Alright, we're out of time.
[01:31:55.251 --> 01:31:55.891]  We gotta go to break.
[01:31:55.931 --> 01:31:56.572]  Thanks for the call.
[01:31:56.592 --> 01:31:58.333]  We'll get his take on that on the other side.
[01:31:58.693 --> 01:31:59.514]  Continue with the calls.
[01:32:01.075 --> 01:32:03.676]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:04.076 --> 01:32:09.060]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:11.161]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:11.461 --> 01:32:16.284]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:17.385]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.625 --> 01:32:18.386]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:20.347]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.648 --> 01:32:21.468]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.708 --> 01:32:23.790]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:25.031]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:25.251 --> 01:32:26.592]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.793 --> 01:32:31.857]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:32.057 --> 01:32:35.260]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:39.103]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:39.443 --> 01:32:40.444]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.685 --> 01:32:41.285]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.586 --> 01:32:42.487]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.687 --> 01:32:43.428]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.608 --> 01:32:44.449]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:47.473]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.773 --> 01:32:49.515]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:49.535 --> 01:32:50.456]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:00.011 --> 01:33:09.817]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[01:33:10.117 --> 01:33:11.518]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:33:11.718 --> 01:33:12.439]  It's very real.
[01:33:12.799 --> 01:33:13.159]  I know.
[01:33:13.499 --> 01:33:17.001]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:33:17.382 --> 01:33:20.123]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[01:33:20.604 --> 01:33:28.809]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecola Blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[01:33:29.249 --> 01:33:35.654]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[01:33:35.934 --> 01:33:44.160]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:33:44.641 --> 01:33:46.262]  Generate your own pure water.
[01:33:46.582 --> 01:33:49.325]  Right from the humidity in the air by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:33:49.345 --> 01:33:49.546]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:33:49.566 --> 01:33:51.949]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at ecoloble.com today.
[01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:06.023]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[01:34:06.403 --> 01:34:06.803]  I'm not.
[01:34:06.923 --> 01:34:07.584]  Don't trust it.
[01:34:07.664 --> 01:34:09.545]  But then I don't want to get the disease either.
[01:34:09.905 --> 01:34:15.328]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:18.070]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[01:34:18.170 --> 01:34:22.232]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[01:34:22.732 --> 01:34:25.434]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[01:34:25.894 --> 01:34:31.320]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.542]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:34:33.882 --> 01:34:42.191]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[01:34:42.431 --> 01:34:43.452]  Don't pick your nose.
[01:34:43.792 --> 01:34:48.094]  Don't shake hands, and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[01:34:48.375 --> 01:34:53.277]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[01:34:53.497 --> 01:34:55.178]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[01:34:55.238 --> 01:34:56.939]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:58.960]  Be well and stay well.
[01:34:59.181 --> 01:35:00.141]  Best MZ.
[01:35:01.302 --> 01:35:03.543]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:35:04.083 --> 01:35:06.865]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:16.914 --> 01:35:21.335]  We are continuing with your phone calls today as promised for Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[01:35:22.536 --> 01:35:24.596]  Saeed in Canada.
[01:35:24.636 --> 01:35:26.717]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[01:35:26.737 --> 01:35:27.197]  Go ahead.
[01:35:28.738 --> 01:35:29.518]  Hi Lindsey.
[01:35:29.598 --> 01:35:30.678]  Hi Alex.
[01:35:30.838 --> 01:35:32.219]  I congratulate both of you.
[01:35:32.239 --> 01:35:36.620]  I always pray for your health, wealth and your family's safety.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:39.021]  And I really stand behind you.
[01:35:39.041 --> 01:35:45.343]  I'm a Muslim and I'd like to comment on your... I have a question basically for Lindsey.
[01:35:46.047 --> 01:35:57.677]  Lindsay, you're a pastor, you're a practicing Christian, and I, being a Muslim, ask you, you were mentioned about the devil's messiah lately when you spoke to the elitist.
[01:35:58.858 --> 01:36:04.463]  And Christianity and Bible also talks about it, informs us about it.
[01:36:05.104 --> 01:36:13.131]  Islam, the last prophet of God, Allah, the Almighty, also told us, Muhammad, peace be upon him, and Jesus, peace be upon him as well,
[01:36:14.327 --> 01:36:30.137]  They both told us about this messiah, or a false messiah, or devil, or a devil's messiah, or the Antichrist, or as in the revelations, in Islamic revelations, he's called Dajjal.
[01:36:30.938 --> 01:36:39.843]  And why don't we do something to reconcile the Jewish prophecies, the Christian prophecies, the Islamic prophecies,
[01:36:40.439 --> 01:36:50.174]  And what we know about scientifically and on ground what they're doing to prepare for that Antichrist that we know is going to come and he's going to take advantage of this system.
[01:36:50.354 --> 01:36:52.878]  They have completed the one world government.
[01:36:53.422 --> 01:36:59.328]  And I believe that he will just come out and take control of the One World Government and say, thank you very much, give me the control.
[01:36:59.348 --> 01:37:02.471]  Okay, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:37:03.292 --> 01:37:05.014]  Specifically the One World Government.
[01:37:05.134 --> 01:37:09.218]  Even if you don't believe in God, the World Government believes they are God.
[01:37:09.238 --> 01:37:10.319]  They're playing God.
[01:37:12.603 --> 01:37:14.765]  They want to manifest this world system.
[01:37:14.805 --> 01:37:15.965]  You have worked with the elite.
[01:37:16.326 --> 01:37:18.007]  I've read their own documents, their own statements.
[01:37:18.027 --> 01:37:20.409]  They're all obsessed with the occult.
[01:37:21.129 --> 01:37:24.892]  They pray to a God, but it's not the God everybody thinks they're praying to.
[01:37:24.932 --> 01:37:25.552]  Lindsey Williams.
[01:37:26.333 --> 01:37:31.617]  Yeah, when George Bush used the expression, our former president, he said, God bless you.
[01:37:31.737 --> 01:37:32.958]  What God was he talking about?
[01:37:33.118 --> 01:37:40.223]  No, he was not talking about the creator of all heaven and earth, the one who sent his son to die for us on the cross and purchase our salvation.
[01:37:40.802 --> 01:37:46.127]  When this elite talked with me just a few days ago, he was not talking about the Antichrist.
[01:37:46.227 --> 01:38:02.541]  When he mentioned the Devil's Messiah, he was talking about a system, a spirit of deception, which they have used over the years to subvert our schools, to bring in evolution, to fool the pastors, and to change our republic to a democracy.
[01:38:02.841 --> 01:38:07.025]  And he went into these individuals as to how they have used this system to do that.
[01:38:07.392 --> 01:38:14.377]  He was not dealing with the Antichrist, the person or being that some religious groups are looking forward to.
[01:38:14.457 --> 01:38:16.119]  We dealt with the subject of the system.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:19.641]  Let's go to another call.
[01:38:19.781 --> 01:38:20.842]  Eric in Wisconsin.
[01:38:20.862 --> 01:38:22.083]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[01:38:22.103 --> 01:38:22.503]  Go ahead.
[01:38:22.523 --> 01:38:25.065]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:26.226]  Good, go ahead.
[01:38:26.246 --> 01:38:27.487]  I have a couple questions, actually.
[01:38:28.127 --> 01:38:30.009]  I have a couple questions.
[01:38:30.529 --> 01:38:33.832]  First off, for Lindsey, I have a couple quick.
[01:38:35.088 --> 01:38:39.932]  The person who brought me to Christ, I've been talking to him for several weeks now, trying to explain the New World Order to him.
[01:38:39.972 --> 01:38:40.813]  He doesn't want to hear it.
[01:38:41.133 --> 01:38:43.495]  He's a totally God-fearing person.
[01:38:43.515 --> 01:38:44.275]  He believes in Jesus.
[01:38:44.295 --> 01:38:45.877]  I mean, he's a wonderful person.
[01:38:46.637 --> 01:38:52.922]  What would, in Lindsay's opinion, be the best way to wake up Christians, and what would be his response to Romans 13?
[01:38:55.504 --> 01:38:57.165]  My goodness, I wish I could wake them up.
[01:38:57.225 --> 01:39:03.270]  I've been trying for 40 years to wake my pastor friends up, but they're so bound
[01:39:03.837 --> 01:39:08.679]  In thinking that the only thing they can do is what they're presently doing.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:14.022]  And, of course, you have to understand that most of them are very happy with the paycheck they're getting.
[01:39:14.842 --> 01:39:17.103]  I think if they lost it, they'd probably be a lot better off.
[01:39:17.763 --> 01:39:20.145]  But I don't know how to wake them up.
[01:39:20.285 --> 01:39:21.105]  I wish I could.
[01:39:21.465 --> 01:39:27.508]  And I hope that Alex's DVD and the new one I've made, I hope it'll wake up a lot of bastards.
[01:39:29.995 --> 01:39:30.375]  I agree.
[01:39:30.395 --> 01:39:41.422]  I just watched a follow-up book the other day, and I'm familiar with Oath Keepers and We Are Change, and I think that people need to figure out where they fit in and get in.
[01:39:41.802 --> 01:39:55.850]  If you've ever pledged allegiance to any social position, I would be a member of Oath Keepers, as well as, if you're not, even if you're a college student or whatever, I'd get involved with We Are Change.
[01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:58.452]  And also, even a message to the elites,
[01:39:59.136 --> 01:40:00.617]  Are the people even involved with the elites?
[01:40:00.777 --> 01:40:03.137]  You know, these are people that are telling you to lie constantly.
[01:40:03.718 --> 01:40:06.018]  At what point do you think that these people are not lying to you?
[01:40:06.038 --> 01:40:08.259]  All right, I appreciate it.
[01:40:08.919 --> 01:40:09.680]  Go ahead, Lindsey.
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:25.645]  Yeah, the reason I know they're not lying to me is because for the past 35 years, they have not told me, these two individuals, and I've been in a number of individuals I'm in touch with, and these two individuals never, in the past 35 years, have ever told me anything that didn't happen.
[01:40:26.078 --> 01:40:33.642]  So, therefore, I take what they're saying today to be true, especially when you're 85 years of age and pacing the graveyard and you nearly died last winter.
[01:40:34.042 --> 01:40:37.643]  So, give this man credit for the fact that he's probably confessing everything.
[01:40:38.244 --> 01:40:38.884]  Absolutely.
[01:40:38.944 --> 01:40:40.305]  Let's go ahead and make another call.
[01:40:40.805 --> 01:40:43.086]  Robert in Colorado, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[01:40:44.166 --> 01:40:45.947]  Hi, it's great talking to both of you guys.
[01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:48.428]  I've got a quick little point before I get to my main point.
[01:40:48.448 --> 01:40:51.970]  You were talking about all the propaganda that's pushing cap and trade.
[01:40:52.372 --> 01:40:56.114]  When I was at the gas station the other day, I actually thought something that was pretty interesting.
[01:40:56.154 --> 01:40:58.336]  It was actually against it.
[01:40:58.416 --> 01:41:02.939]  It was the gas station telling you how much more your gas prices will go up.
[01:41:02.959 --> 01:41:13.025]  I was in a locally owned Austin gas station, and they had a little red flyer against cap-and-trade, and I said, did the Dutch Royal Shell give this to you?
[01:41:13.045 --> 01:41:15.107]  And they said, no, the owner did.
[01:41:17.203 --> 01:41:21.986]  I mean, I think that's really great for businesses who are really kind of trying to inform people about what's happening.
[01:41:22.006 --> 01:41:24.308]  It's kind of when cigarette taxes, kind of same thing.
[01:41:24.348 --> 01:41:29.912]  But my main point is that, you know, as I've been listening to the show, I've been getting more and more, you know, trying to organize.
[01:41:30.862 --> 01:41:48.216]  A small group of people in my local city, it's called Humans Against Insanity, and we've got blogs and news and we're trying to do little stuff on our school, but I ended up designing a poster for educating people against the vaccines and the swine flu and everything like that.
[01:41:48.276 --> 01:41:49.877]  I tried posting it around my school.
[01:41:49.917 --> 01:41:53.300]  They've got a free speech zone where you can post anything.
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:56.423]  The posters were denied by the school to go on the main boards.
[01:41:57.162 --> 01:42:00.883]  Because obviously they're for the healthy and vaccination.
[01:42:01.284 --> 01:42:01.704]  That's right.
[01:42:01.724 --> 01:42:04.905]  How do you know something is effective?
[01:42:05.525 --> 01:42:07.986]  You know it's effective if the establishment doesn't want it up.
[01:42:08.006 --> 01:42:09.227]  But I'm going to let you go.
[01:42:09.867 --> 01:42:10.467]  Here's the deal.
[01:42:10.487 --> 01:42:12.928]  I went to the first five or six callers that were on the board.
[01:42:13.408 --> 01:42:17.370]  But now the callers need to be specifically for questions for Lindsey Williams.
[01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:18.470]  I got him until 40 after.
[01:42:21.403 --> 01:42:24.205]  If you missed what he covered in the last three shows, it's on his DVD.
[01:42:24.245 --> 01:42:32.432]  We'll tell you how to get that before he leaves us, but bottom line, these are calls for Lindsey Williams now.
[01:42:32.452 --> 01:42:32.713]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:42:33.153 --> 01:42:35.335]  But great, great job, Robert.
[01:42:35.375 --> 01:42:35.795]  Keep it up.
[01:42:35.815 --> 01:42:37.337]  Call me back on another day and tell me about it.
[01:42:37.677 --> 01:42:39.238]  Dan in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[01:42:39.278 --> 01:42:39.658]  Go ahead.
[01:42:40.779 --> 01:42:43.081]  Yeah, hi Alex and Lindsey, thanks for what you're doing.
[01:42:43.942 --> 01:42:49.287]  Right to the point, Lindsey, as a chaplain, you probably know full well that in the Book of Revelations it says that
[01:42:50.657 --> 01:42:52.279]  There is going to come about a global dictator.
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:43:00.406]  And I'm wondering, even though we're supposed to be fighting evil, and I do fight these guys every day the best I can, what can we do to actually stop all this?
[01:43:00.907 --> 01:43:03.549]  Because God said in the Bible that it is going to happen.
[01:43:03.649 --> 01:43:06.832]  There is going to come about a global government and a global dictator.
[01:43:07.933 --> 01:43:12.498]  And since that's already written... I want to comment and then get Lindsey's take.
[01:43:12.538 --> 01:43:12.738]  Look.
[01:43:14.707 --> 01:43:17.329]  The government loves the doctrine in the churches of Romans 13.
[01:43:17.389 --> 01:43:19.851]  The founding fathers were bad.
[01:43:20.211 --> 01:43:22.013]  Lay down to your King George III.
[01:43:22.513 --> 01:43:24.314]  He is bestowed upon us by God.
[01:43:24.695 --> 01:43:25.695]  It's a total distortion.
[01:43:25.715 --> 01:43:28.778]  I've had pastor after pastor after pastor on the radio.
[01:43:28.858 --> 01:43:34.322]  Almost all the prophets, Jesus, you name it, were killed by the government.
[01:43:35.495 --> 01:43:40.637]  Because they didn't follow orders and because, I mean, the Pharisees were the religious leaders.
[01:43:40.957 --> 01:43:47.939]  Christ went in and whipped them with a whip and overturned their tables with the money changers.
[01:43:48.159 --> 01:43:53.361]  Now, what we have here is, let's say it's the end of the world five years from now.
[01:43:53.421 --> 01:43:54.622]  I don't believe that, but whatever.
[01:43:55.182 --> 01:43:56.662]  Let's say all this is going to happen now.
[01:43:57.523 --> 01:44:04.125]  It's my job to let people know this is the world government system so they can warn others that it's bad to not be part of it.
[01:44:05.202 --> 01:44:07.584]  But instead, Christians think they're going to be teleported out of here.
[01:44:07.945 --> 01:44:09.266]  They thought that in Nazi Germany.
[01:44:09.286 --> 01:44:11.348]  They thought that in Rwanda in 1993.
[01:44:11.889 --> 01:44:16.954]  And when they're not being teleported out of here, they're really going to wonder what happened.
[01:44:16.994 --> 01:44:17.655]  Lindsay Williams.
[01:44:18.836 --> 01:44:22.740]  Total misinterpretation of that scripture that you're talking about in Romans.
[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:27.585]  Pastors take it and twist it to mean exactly what they think it means.
[01:44:28.394 --> 01:44:30.616]  Oh my goodness, quick, let me give you this.
[01:44:30.916 --> 01:44:32.597]  Lend unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.
[01:44:32.937 --> 01:44:34.058]  Caesar was a dictator.
[01:44:34.178 --> 01:44:36.819]  We don't have a king in the United States of America.
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:39.841]  Who is Caesar in the United States of America?
[01:44:39.901 --> 01:44:41.422]  Come on folks, wake up!
[01:44:41.883 --> 01:44:47.746]  I beg of you pastors, the first three words of the Constitution, we the people.
[01:44:48.087 --> 01:44:54.871]  We are a constitutional republic, and in a constitutional republic you don't lend anything unto a king.
[01:44:55.379 --> 01:45:01.284]  The people are the ruling force of the United States of America.
[01:45:01.324 --> 01:45:08.670]  Quit preaching this business of trying to be obedient to a bunch of godless presidents and congressmen.
[01:45:08.910 --> 01:45:10.872]  That is not what the scriptures say at all.
[01:45:10.892 --> 01:45:22.902]  Well, Pastor, going back to Christ and to Paul, and you're the expert on this show, and regardless of people believing God or not, this is what's governing our systems, so we should talk about it, but they were trying to set Christ up.
[01:45:23.939 --> 01:45:30.847]  They were trying to set Paul up, saying, should we pay taxes knowing he'd be killed if he said no?
[01:45:31.288 --> 01:45:34.692]  And he said, look, the things that are God's are God's, the things that are Caesar.
[01:45:35.092 --> 01:45:36.013]  Whose face on that?
[01:45:36.153 --> 01:45:36.694]  It's Caesar.
[01:45:36.714 --> 01:45:37.635]  It's his system.
[01:45:38.484 --> 01:45:42.527]  But God also says, keep the commandments, don't be part of evil.
[01:45:42.988 --> 01:45:47.371]  Why were the Christians killed in Rome in the first 300 years A.D.
[01:45:47.691 --> 01:45:48.492]  or Common Era?
[01:45:48.932 --> 01:45:52.175]  Because they were saying no to following what Caesar said.
[01:45:53.115 --> 01:45:56.758]  These churches are so devilish on their face, Pastor Williams.
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:00.962]  501c3 is a noose around your neck.
[01:46:01.742 --> 01:46:06.066]  Separation of church and state is never in the Constitution of the United States of America.
[01:46:06.146 --> 01:46:07.807]  It's buzzwords they've put in your mind.
[01:46:08.214 --> 01:46:13.779]  Listen to Thomas Jefferson and be realistic, folks, and take the Bible for what it says.
[01:46:13.859 --> 01:46:20.864]  Thomas Jefferson, one of the founders of this nation, said, Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:46:21.845 --> 01:46:25.308]  Oh my goodness, preachers, I wish I could preach it in your pulpit every Sunday.
[01:46:25.608 --> 01:46:33.975]  The truth of a constitutional republic and the United States of America for what it is and what the Bible really says
[01:46:36.665 --> 01:46:37.305]  I don't know, Alex.
[01:46:37.345 --> 01:46:38.346]  We need to hold Ramsey up a little bit.
[01:46:38.366 --> 01:46:38.906]  Remain in your houses!
[01:47:04.534 --> 01:47:09.680]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[01:47:10.301 --> 01:47:11.282]  Will they do it?
[01:47:11.662 --> 01:47:13.624]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[01:47:14.265 --> 01:47:20.212]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[01:47:20.732 --> 01:47:22.053]  Think it can't happen here?
[01:47:22.914 --> 01:47:26.457]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[01:47:27.197 --> 01:47:31.501]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[01:47:32.081 --> 01:47:36.364]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[01:47:36.985 --> 01:47:41.829]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[01:47:42.729 --> 01:47:50.857]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:47:51.157 --> 01:47:53.440]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.

[01:48:00.888 --> 01:48:02.990]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:48:03.230 --> 01:48:03.530]  October 27, 2009.
[01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:04.651]  Gold opened this morning at $1037.90.
[01:48:04.691 --> 01:48:07.994]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1066.82, $533.41 for a half-ounce, or $266.70 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:48:08.014 --> 01:48:08.454]  That's $1066.82, $533.41, or $266.70.
[01:48:20.279 --> 01:48:30.602]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:48:30.742 --> 01:48:33.863]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:48:33.963 --> 01:48:37.284]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:48:37.364 --> 01:48:40.125]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[01:48:40.345 --> 01:48:43.027]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:48:43.107 --> 01:48:45.828]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:48:46.048 --> 01:48:48.229]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:48:48.369 --> 01:48:49.050]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:48:49.710 --> 01:48:54.913]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:48:54.933 --> 01:48:55.133]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:49:02.248 --> 01:49:05.913]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:49:06.294 --> 01:49:09.298]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:49:09.538 --> 01:49:14.325]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:49:14.345 --> 01:49:18.190]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[01:49:18.826 --> 01:49:20.528]  And they really are calling the shots.
[01:49:20.708 --> 01:49:25.755]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:49:26.275 --> 01:49:29.039]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:49:29.179 --> 01:49:35.907]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:49:36.007 --> 01:49:38.109]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:49:38.369 --> 01:49:39.690]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:42.212]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:49:42.412 --> 01:49:44.254]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:49:44.534 --> 01:49:49.258]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:49:49.678 --> 01:49:54.442]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:50:30.539 --> 01:50:32.981]  Everywhere I see mold, it's magic in a bottle.

[01:51:06.670 --> 01:51:08.351]  Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[01:51:08.471 --> 01:51:10.013]  We're taking phone calls for him.
[01:51:10.493 --> 01:51:12.355]  Ruth in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[01:51:12.435 --> 01:51:12.876]  Welcome.
[01:51:13.997 --> 01:51:16.159]  Yes, Alex, you're awesome.
[01:51:16.579 --> 01:51:17.080]  You're awesome.
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:18.621]  Pastor Lindsey, you're awesome.
[01:51:18.941 --> 01:51:21.424]  Two-part question for Pastor Lindsey.
[01:51:22.388 --> 01:51:29.091]  Are they going to try to increase our interest rate on our mortgage to try to take our homes?
[01:51:29.671 --> 01:51:34.553]  Because if it goes so far, you know, we're not able to pay for it.
[01:51:35.174 --> 01:51:36.134]  Another question.
[01:51:36.875 --> 01:51:46.459]  If people that have gold and silver shares, bonds, or certificates, is that going to be safe or is that going to be worthless?
[01:51:46.959 --> 01:51:48.179]  Okay, appreciate your call.
[01:51:50.006 --> 01:51:51.808]  A piece of paper is worth what it's written on.
[01:51:52.088 --> 01:51:53.269]  It's nothing but a piece of paper.
[01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:57.993]  This gentleman did a few days ago, this silly, did talk with me about that.
[01:51:58.133 --> 01:51:59.114]  I'm so glad you asked.
[01:51:59.134 --> 01:52:02.557]  He said gold and silver are all you can depend on.
[01:52:02.677 --> 01:52:04.719]  He's talking about holding it in your hand.
[01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:11.065]  They know that nothing has any value except what is in their hand or their pocket.
[01:52:11.125 --> 01:52:13.487]  You need your own gold and silver in your hand.
[01:52:13.867 --> 01:52:17.050]  A piece of paper, again, let me stress, they do not trust it.
[01:52:17.486 --> 01:52:17.806]  Absolutely.
[01:52:17.826 --> 01:52:18.847]  That's a really good point.
[01:52:18.867 --> 01:52:19.948]  Let's continue and talk to Brad in Texas.
[01:52:19.968 --> 01:52:21.049]  Brad, you're on the air.
[01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:21.629]  Hello Alex and Lindsey.
[01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:22.270]  I had a quick question.
[01:52:22.290 --> 01:52:24.252]  You said that these people did have a religion.
[01:52:47.476 --> 01:52:55.381]  Um, what exactly religion is that, and what is their code of ethics that you mentioned the other day?
[01:52:56.542 --> 01:52:58.523]  The elite positively have a code of ethics.
[01:52:58.764 --> 01:53:00.145]  They are not atheists.
[01:53:00.685 --> 01:53:01.986]  But, they worship a God.
[01:53:02.246 --> 01:53:04.968]  But not the same God which is the God of the Bible.
[01:53:05.468 --> 01:53:08.210]  The Prince of the Power of this Air is what they worship.
[01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:10.151]  They worship the God of this world.
[01:53:10.471 --> 01:53:15.895]  And when George Bush said, God bless you, he was talking about Skull and Bones God.
[01:53:16.403 --> 01:53:19.624]  He was not talking about the God who sent his son.
[01:53:19.664 --> 01:53:21.784]  And their rituals have now been videotaped.
[01:53:21.864 --> 01:53:22.825]  ABC News had it.
[01:53:22.885 --> 01:53:23.985]  It's Satan worship.
[01:53:24.165 --> 01:53:33.407]  They bow and pledge allegiance to the Prince of Darkness on the male side and to the goddess Eulogia on the other.
[01:53:36.008 --> 01:53:37.428]  Yes, this is true.
[01:53:37.628 --> 01:53:39.849]  They are Satanists.
[01:53:40.069 --> 01:53:40.509]  That's true.
[01:53:42.469 --> 01:53:45.211]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:53:45.432 --> 01:53:47.454]  Let's talk to Trey in Connecticut.
[01:53:47.794 --> 01:53:48.775]  Trey, you're on the air.
[01:53:50.196 --> 01:53:50.616]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:50.656 --> 01:53:51.117]  Hey, Lindsey.
[01:53:51.157 --> 01:53:52.058]  How are you guys doing today?
[01:53:52.658 --> 01:53:52.938]  Good.
[01:53:52.958 --> 01:53:54.520]  Speaking of skull and bones, there you are.
[01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:57.362]  Yeah, right next door.
[01:53:57.543 --> 01:53:59.865]  I'm just 45 minutes up the highway.
[01:54:00.285 --> 01:54:01.506]  From New Haven, Connecticut.
[01:54:01.526 --> 01:54:03.048]  Go ahead.
[01:54:03.828 --> 01:54:05.029]  No, New Haven, Connecticut.
[01:54:05.069 --> 01:54:05.930]  What's on your mind?
[01:54:06.751 --> 01:54:08.973]  I came across an article that ended up
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:10.621]  Catching my mind the other day.
[01:54:11.482 --> 01:54:14.225]  Official disclosure of extraterrestrial life is imminent.
[01:54:15.266 --> 01:54:19.631]  Yeah, I see a lot of that from the Disclosure Project run by the Rothschilds and others.
[01:54:21.107 --> 01:54:26.448]  We know there's a declassified program, part of it is declassified Bluebeam, to have staged alien landings.
[01:54:26.669 --> 01:54:28.989]  And I just cover what I can prove.
[01:54:29.029 --> 01:54:30.550]  We don't do the whole UFO thing.
[01:54:30.890 --> 01:54:33.190]  We don't dislike people that do.
[01:54:34.011 --> 01:54:40.872]  But the mainstream media tries to mix that in with the Federal Reserve being private or world government to discredit what we're doing.
[01:54:41.773 --> 01:54:45.154]  But Lindsey, you want to comment on Martians?
[01:54:46.094 --> 01:54:46.894]  Yes.
[01:54:47.034 --> 01:54:50.475]  For three months time, I didn't do a single radio talk show up until last week.
[01:54:51.044 --> 01:55:00.371]  And the reason I didn't is because I say exactly like Alex just said, unless I know what I'm talking about, and I can prove it, I'm not going to say it.
[01:55:01.012 --> 01:55:16.203]  Now, when this man told me on the phone days ago what he did, I'm spreading it everywhere across this nation, from one side to the other, every radio show I can get on, everything I can possibly do, because I know it's going to happen just like he said it, because they have it planned.
[01:55:18.041 --> 01:55:19.661]  All right, thank you so much, Trey.
[01:55:19.761 --> 01:55:21.382]  Joe in Connecticut, go ahead.
[01:55:24.102 --> 01:55:24.662]  He hung up.
[01:55:25.083 --> 01:55:26.363]  Let's go to Joe in Florida.
[01:55:26.423 --> 01:55:27.183]  Joe, go ahead.
[01:55:27.203 --> 01:55:29.964]  Okay, they're hanging up as we go to him here.
[01:55:29.984 --> 01:55:31.564]  I'm going to look at the call list then.
[01:55:31.924 --> 01:55:33.004]  Harry in Michigan.
[01:55:33.064 --> 01:55:34.004]  Harry, you're on the air.
[01:55:35.165 --> 01:55:35.765]  Oh, hi, guys.
[01:55:35.805 --> 01:55:36.285]  How are you?
[01:55:36.825 --> 01:55:37.025]  Good.
[01:55:37.045 --> 01:55:37.405]  Hi, Harry.
[01:55:38.905 --> 01:55:39.946]  Lindsey, I got a question.
[01:55:40.426 --> 01:55:44.867]  I'm a retired pipefitter, and I worked up on a pipeline.
[01:55:46.713 --> 01:55:52.817]  And I know exactly what you're talking about with the cacto oil up there.
[01:55:53.977 --> 01:56:08.026]  And the people of the United States are just being taken as fools because we've got so much oil surplus up in Alaska, and not to speak of what's down in the Gulf.
[01:56:09.107 --> 01:56:14.070]  And it's just a shame that America won't wake up.
[01:56:14.090 --> 01:56:16.251]  It's like casting pearls to swine.
[01:56:17.902 --> 01:56:27.666]  I'm going to let you go, sir.
[01:56:27.686 --> 01:56:31.107]  We're going to get a comment from Lindsey in our final segment with him.
[01:56:31.547 --> 01:56:33.367]  Straight ahead, we're going to continue with calls.
[01:56:33.868 --> 01:56:34.768]  We're going to talk to Pat.
[01:56:36.187 --> 01:56:38.449]  Matt, Pat, and others.
[01:56:38.469 --> 01:56:39.229]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:56:39.609 --> 01:56:43.672]  Final segment with Lindsey Williams.
[01:56:44.032 --> 01:56:46.514]  Then I've got a final News Blitz coming up as well.
[01:56:46.954 --> 01:56:49.095]  Right here on the GCN Radio Network, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:56:50.957 --> 01:56:51.857]  We're on the march.
[01:56:52.357 --> 01:56:53.958]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:56:54.879 --> 01:56:57.561]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:05.187]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:57:05.327 --> 01:57:09.673]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:57:09.853 --> 01:57:11.716]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:57:12.136 --> 01:57:13.478]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:57:13.758 --> 01:57:14.800]  There is a solution.
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:23.024]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:58:06.166 --> 01:58:09.168]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:09.408 --> 01:58:10.809]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:58:11.539 --> 01:58:14.181]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:58:14.201 --> 01:58:20.405]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:58:20.585 --> 01:58:25.628]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:58:25.788 --> 01:58:35.754]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:58:35.874 --> 01:58:37.996]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:58:38.236 --> 01:58:39.557]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:58:39.817 --> 01:58:42.099]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:58:42.279 --> 01:58:44.120]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:49.144]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:58:49.544 --> 01:58:54.328]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:59:06.085 --> 01:59:08.366]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.

[02:00:28.326 --> 02:00:29.746]  Final segment with Lindsey Williams.
[02:00:30.166 --> 02:00:31.626]  We'll let him go here in about 10 minutes.
[02:00:32.466 --> 02:00:36.427]  But let's continue with phone calls for our guests.
[02:00:36.467 --> 02:00:37.708]  I'm going to move rapid fire now.
[02:00:37.768 --> 02:00:39.288]  Please direct your question at Lindsey.
[02:00:39.668 --> 02:00:40.908]  We're going to jump to the next person.
[02:00:41.248 --> 02:00:42.489]  Pat in Oklahoma.
[02:00:42.889 --> 02:00:43.849]  You're on the air, Pat.
[02:00:45.369 --> 02:01:00.280]  Hi, my question is for Lindsey, and I guess my question is, what is your comment, like according to biblical prophecy, if we are in the last days, this one world government is going to have to come about?
[02:01:01.641 --> 02:01:06.924]  And do you think maybe we're entering into a time of God's judgment on the nations?
[02:01:08.706 --> 02:01:11.948]  Well, definitely it's coming about, merely because it's biblical prophecy.
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:16.761]  Yet, on the other hand, there may be some places that don't suffer it quite as much as others.
[02:01:17.261 --> 02:01:24.304]  And you'll have to understand that America has a biblical, constitutional, godly background.
[02:01:24.724 --> 02:01:30.025]  And I believe the Constitution is probably as close of a document as you'd find anywhere in the world to God-given.
[02:01:30.305 --> 02:01:37.688]  Now, the Word of God is the most God-given document on the face of this earth, but the Constitution definitely was inspired of the Lord.
[02:01:38.108 --> 02:01:38.748]  I would hope
[02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:43.901]  That America will not suffer as drastically as much of the rest of the world.
[02:01:43.921 --> 02:02:00.524]  I must admit outright that in my Bible study of 50 years, and I'm in my 70s, I cannot find America in the judgments, now you hear my words, I cannot find America in the judgments of the book of Revelation.
[02:02:01.244 --> 02:02:07.605]  Maybe we don't suffer as much as the rest of the world because maybe we'll see a repentance before that time.
[02:02:07.665 --> 02:02:08.605]  That's what I'm hoping for.
[02:02:10.097 --> 02:02:11.438]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:11.918 --> 02:02:14.279]  Let's talk to Matt in California.
[02:02:14.339 --> 02:02:15.039]  Matt, go ahead.
[02:02:16.099 --> 02:02:16.960]  Hi, Pastor Lindsey.
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:17.480]  Hi, Alex.
[02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:18.140]  Hey.
[02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:18.680]  Hi, Matt.
[02:02:19.361 --> 02:02:19.461]  Hi.
[02:02:19.641 --> 02:02:25.143]  I'm a former Navy Submariner, and I'm now a seminary student, and I just have a quick comment and a question for our guest.
[02:02:26.264 --> 02:02:29.665]  Just a question, or actually I'm going to go to comment, about Genesis 3.15.
[02:02:29.705 --> 02:02:39.749]  I heard a caller calling in about it, and I just wanted to, I was sitting here doing my Hebrew studies, and I just wanted, people out there who are studying the Old Testament, the language, you can do a lot of damage if you don't know the languages fluently.
[02:02:40.479 --> 02:02:49.463]  And the passage is talking about what theologians call the Proto-Evangelium, and that's the first word of redemption in a gospel germ form about Messiah Christ.
[02:02:49.483 --> 02:02:54.545]  That's what the seed is talking about in that passage, and that's how the original audience would have understood that passage.
[02:02:54.985 --> 02:03:02.108]  But, Pastor Lindsay, I have a question regarding the gentleman that's been giving you this information.
[02:03:02.128 --> 02:03:07.690]  I just was curious as to his theological disposition, whether he's atheist-agnostic,
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:10.181]  How many gods does he believe in?
[02:03:10.201 --> 02:03:12.382]  What does he believe about Jesus Christ?
[02:03:12.722 --> 02:03:13.423]  How to get saved?
[02:03:15.644 --> 02:03:28.070]  I am hoping, from the latest conversation that we've had, that probably the reason he's being honest with me and telling me many of these things is because I think something happened to him spiritually this past year.
[02:03:28.730 --> 02:03:34.133]  Now, I'm hoping to get much more in depth into it, but I'm hoping for the best.
[02:03:35.854 --> 02:03:36.134]  Thank you.
[02:03:37.657 --> 02:03:38.718]  Alright, thank you so much.
[02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:39.598]  Good to hear from you.
[02:03:41.279 --> 02:03:42.199]  Who's up next here?
[02:03:42.219 --> 02:03:45.661]  Pat in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:03:45.701 --> 02:03:46.081]  Go ahead.
[02:03:46.842 --> 02:03:47.322]  Hello.
[02:03:48.562 --> 02:03:51.884]  I have kind of a quick question for you both.
[02:03:54.065 --> 02:04:02.389]  I know everything is going on here and it's coming down to crunch time and all that, but is this happening all over the world too?
[02:04:02.409 --> 02:04:05.591]  Because I've never heard anybody mention that.
[02:04:08.055 --> 02:04:09.797]  That's pretty much my question.
[02:04:09.877 --> 02:04:10.297]  Lindsey?
[02:04:11.318 --> 02:04:11.618]  Yes.
[02:04:12.699 --> 02:04:20.306]  The financial crisis, the banking crisis, Iceland has declared bankruptcy, a number of other countries now on the verge of bankruptcy.
[02:04:20.686 --> 02:04:21.907]  Yes, this is worldwide.
[02:04:22.007 --> 02:04:27.272]  In fact, it is a new world order.
[02:04:27.932 --> 02:04:30.375]  And I think when you look in the scriptures, you'll find the same thing.
[02:04:30.655 --> 02:04:31.215]  It's global.
[02:04:32.036 --> 02:04:33.918]  But I'm hoping, there again,
[02:04:34.602 --> 02:04:37.123]  Express what I said to the prior caller.
[02:04:37.523 --> 02:04:47.245]  I am hoping that America is spared some of this because with our background, we will see a turnaround, godly, and repentance.
[02:04:49.585 --> 02:04:50.065]  Okay.
[02:04:50.725 --> 02:04:51.926]  Does that answer your question?
[02:04:52.526 --> 02:04:53.566]  Yes, sir, it does.
[02:04:54.866 --> 02:04:55.406]  Thank you.
[02:04:55.807 --> 02:04:56.507]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:56.987 --> 02:04:58.527]  Let's talk to Mark in Texas.
[02:04:58.607 --> 02:04:59.347]  Mark, go ahead.
[02:04:59.367 --> 02:05:02.428]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex and Lindy.
[02:05:03.349 --> 02:05:10.515]  Great stuff everybody needs to be hearing about and I'm glad to be on here and Wanted to touch on a few things if that's okay.
[02:05:10.875 --> 02:05:11.095]  Sure.
[02:05:11.175 --> 02:05:11.576]  Go ahead.
[02:05:11.776 --> 02:05:12.897]  You have any questions for Lindsey?
[02:05:13.537 --> 02:05:15.118]  I caught no just want to touch on it.
[02:05:15.138 --> 02:05:17.160]  Well, we're taking calls for Lindsey Williams.
[02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:19.041]  Yeah, I have a question for him.
[02:05:19.081 --> 02:05:20.222]  Definitely.
[02:05:20.262 --> 02:05:22.244]  Ask your question, please Okay.
[02:05:22.284 --> 02:05:29.089]  Well, it's more than a question I just wanted to give a refresher of what what I spoke with you once about Alex, which was um, I
[02:05:29.614 --> 02:05:43.606]  I mentioned this book that I got from research that has a Bible verse in it from Luke 12, 52, and it says that the lawyer says, woe unto them, you know, you hindered, you took away the knowledge from people, you enter not in yourselves and you hinder those trying to enter in.
[02:05:43.666 --> 02:05:48.691]  And I, you know, it was a guy that exposed the probate lawyer system.
[02:05:49.472 --> 02:06:00.675]  The probate lawyers, similar to all the things that these elites are doing, taking away, you know... Yeah, the probate lawyers most of the time go and sell you out, or... But that's another subject.
[02:06:00.855 --> 02:06:07.757]  Listen, I appreciate your call, but we don't have a lot of time left with Lindsey, and so we need questions addressed to Lindsey, not kind of pet projects.
[02:06:07.777 --> 02:06:11.578]  And I'm not trying to be mean to you, sir, but we normally have totally wide open phones.
[02:06:11.638 --> 02:06:12.739]  We don't screen your calls.
[02:06:13.119 --> 02:06:17.540]  And when I say that we need questions for Lindsey, and that's why he's here, that's what we're doing this for, okay?
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:20.942]  John in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:06:22.243 --> 02:06:24.024]  Lindsey, you keep talking about a timeline.
[02:06:24.064 --> 02:06:30.328]  I'd like to know where we are in the timeline right now and where and when the next part's going to take place.
[02:06:31.169 --> 02:06:32.630]  Yes, he did give me a timeline.
[02:06:32.930 --> 02:06:35.091]  I'll give you just a few of the expressions very quickly.
[02:06:35.371 --> 02:06:38.193]  Within two years, you will not recognize America.
[02:06:38.353 --> 02:06:43.437]  Again, he said, after two years, you will be so poor, you will not be able to rebel.
[02:06:43.891 --> 02:06:50.797]  He went on to say that nearly everyone will be working for the government, or the state, within two years.
[02:06:50.837 --> 02:06:57.923]  He kept repeating over and over and over their altered timeline of a two-year period, and they have some definite plans now.
[02:06:57.963 --> 02:07:01.487]  Whether they will succeed in accomplishing it or not is another story.
[02:07:01.527 --> 02:07:02.247]  I hope they don't.
[02:07:02.648 --> 02:07:04.749]  But on the other hand, that is their timeline.
[02:07:04.769 --> 02:07:07.192]  Okay.
[02:07:07.372 --> 02:07:10.194]  Well, what about the people who don't want to work for the government?
[02:07:10.234 --> 02:07:11.035]  What's going to happen to them?
[02:07:12.088 --> 02:07:20.774]  Well, there will be some mom-and-pop businesses that don't have mortgages that won't be taken over by all of this, but keep in mind there was one other thing he told me, too.
[02:07:21.195 --> 02:07:23.396]  He said war is planned after two years.
[02:07:24.077 --> 02:07:35.965]  Now, that is going to encompass so many new things that we never even thought of before, because when war comes in and the whole world eventually gets involved, you're talking a whole new ballgame here.
[02:07:36.326 --> 02:07:39.168]  And let me add, I appreciate your call, John.
[02:07:40.794 --> 02:07:45.797]  But they're announcing the feds are taking over the internet for our safety and may shut it off during emergencies.
[02:07:46.358 --> 02:07:47.859]  That's in my stack I'm about to cover.
[02:07:48.739 --> 02:07:51.821]  They're announcing the government's taking over every facet of our lives.
[02:07:52.602 --> 02:07:57.525]  And you may work for a big corporation, but it's going to rely on government contracts.
[02:07:58.445 --> 02:08:09.753]  Because the big Fortune 500, they want government contracts to control everything, because they control the government, and the government will only give them the contracts.
[02:08:10.737 --> 02:08:17.063]  It's these big corporations tying in with government and using that to perfect their tyranny.
[02:08:17.864 --> 02:08:20.206]  But by speaking out against this, we may be able to stop it.
[02:08:21.167 --> 02:08:22.688]  Let's jam in a few final calls.
[02:08:22.788 --> 02:08:24.029]  Virgil in Oklahoma.
[02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:25.751]  Virgil, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:08:26.612 --> 02:08:28.353]  Alright, quick butt-kissing to you, Alex.
[02:08:28.453 --> 02:08:30.215]  Great job on the fall of the Republic.
[02:08:31.224 --> 02:08:34.868]  Um, Mr. Williams, can you elaborate on the Devil's Messiah?
[02:08:35.148 --> 02:08:39.131]  Or maybe point me to some research material where I could look this up further?
[02:08:39.332 --> 02:08:48.860]  Well, that's the term this elitist used for how they've taken over the churches and have the churches selling the people on tyranny, the clergy response teams, correct, Lindsey?
[02:08:49.741 --> 02:08:51.302]  Yeah, you won't find that on the internet.
[02:08:51.563 --> 02:08:55.746]  I mean, if I had not been talking with this individual, and if I had not known him for 35 years,
[02:08:56.934 --> 02:08:58.375]  All right, Virgil, thank you.
[02:08:58.395 --> 02:08:59.576]  Eric in California, go.
[02:08:59.596 --> 02:09:00.136]  That was explosive.
[02:09:00.176 --> 02:09:01.397]  Eric, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:09:26.874 --> 02:09:27.454]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:09:29.035 --> 02:09:34.756]  The question for you, Lindsey, is that basically when you say the dollar is going to be dead, does that mean that necessarily it's going to zero?
[02:09:34.916 --> 02:09:39.617]  And if it's going to zero, what is going to happen to all the revolving lines of credit?
[02:09:40.017 --> 02:09:47.739]  Well, I don't believe that means they're going to slowly kill it and devalue it to monetize and pay off the fiat debt to themselves.
[02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:51.080]  Is that the intel you've got, Lindsey?
[02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:52.520]  That's correct.
[02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:54.641]  In fact, whenever you take a wheelbarrow load
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:59.083]  of dollars to the grocery store to buy a loaf of bread, you will know the dollar's dead.
[02:09:59.103 --> 02:10:02.485]  Okay, and that's going to happen in two years?
[02:10:04.466 --> 02:10:08.348]  Uh, he said, he put it this way, I'll read, I'll give you his exact words.
[02:10:08.929 --> 02:10:15.653]  He said, uh, by 2012, within approximately two years, the dollar will be dead, and he used the word dead.
[02:10:16.173 --> 02:10:17.074]  Alright, thank you, Eric.
[02:10:17.114 --> 02:10:17.334]  Go ahead.
[02:10:19.801 --> 02:10:22.242]  It means it won't be the world currency.
[02:10:22.262 --> 02:10:27.625]  You're still going to have dollars, just like they have devalued pesos in Mexico, Argentina.
[02:10:28.246 --> 02:10:31.347]  It means the dollar will no longer be the world reserve currency.
[02:10:32.048 --> 02:10:33.869]  And that's how we're buying all these cheap goods.
[02:10:33.929 --> 02:10:34.529]  Correct, Lindsey?
[02:10:35.209 --> 02:10:35.970]  That is correct.
[02:10:36.210 --> 02:10:38.391]  It will no longer be the reserve currency of the world.
[02:10:38.451 --> 02:10:45.355]  In fact, that was pretty much brought to pass here a few weeks ago when OPEC said we're going to have a basket of currencies.
[02:10:45.835 --> 02:10:49.197]  And you'll see this progressively over the next two years.
[02:10:53.197 --> 02:10:55.121]  In fact, I've got a mainstream news article.
[02:10:55.161 --> 02:10:57.807]  Here's the New York Post, but it was all over the news two weeks ago.
[02:11:02.435 --> 02:11:06.516]  A dollar loses reserve status to yen and euro.
[02:11:06.857 --> 02:11:09.397]  Dollar loses reserve status to yen and euro.
[02:11:09.678 --> 02:11:15.560]  They've now gone more to buying euros and other currencies than they are the dollar.
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:16.940]  So it's already begun.
[02:11:17.460 --> 02:11:18.401]  Sometimes I'll read a headline.
[02:11:18.421 --> 02:11:19.181]  I can't seem to read it.
[02:11:19.201 --> 02:11:21.262]  I had one of those moments just now because I'm in a hurry.
[02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:27.524]  I'm going to give each caller 30 seconds, because I've got to go to a news blitz.
[02:11:27.564 --> 02:11:28.345]  I promise to do it.
[02:11:28.385 --> 02:11:31.488]  I'm disciplining myself here to take calls and cover news.
[02:11:32.048 --> 02:11:35.251]  And I'm trying to get better, because that's what I think is a better radio show.
[02:11:35.711 --> 02:11:39.575]  I could just settle into ranting for four hours, but I want to give people a more diverse view.
[02:11:40.276 --> 02:11:42.478]  Very quickly, Omar in Texas, go.
[02:11:43.652 --> 02:11:44.593]  Hey, how you doing there, guys?
[02:11:45.213 --> 02:11:45.533]  Good, how are you?
[02:11:45.553 --> 02:11:46.233]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:46.253 --> 02:11:46.994]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:47.014 --> 02:11:48.194]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:48.234 --> 02:11:48.995]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:49.015 --> 02:11:49.795]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:49.815 --> 02:11:50.596]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:50.616 --> 02:11:51.956]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:51.976 --> 02:11:52.577]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:52.597 --> 02:11:53.097]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:53.137 --> 02:11:53.717]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:53.737 --> 02:11:54.878]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:54.898 --> 02:11:55.398]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:55.418 --> 02:11:56.198]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:56.218 --> 02:11:57.439]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:57.759 --> 02:11:59.640]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:00.481]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:12:00.501 --> 02:12:01.221]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:12:01.241 --> 02:12:01.921]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:12:01.941 --> 02:12:03.002]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:12:03.022 --> 02:12:03.482]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:12:03.502 --> 02:12:04.122]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:12:04.142 --> 02:12:06.123]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:12:06.143 --> 02:12:07.004]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:12:07.024 --> 02:12:07.604]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:12:07.644 --> 02:12:08.184]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:12:08.264 --> 02:12:09.245]  Good, good, how are you?
[02:12:09.265 --> 02:12:09.565]  Good
[02:12:13.857 --> 02:12:27.187]  But I would just like to just, you know, I'm a member of the Mormon Church, and we get a lot of flack from other Christian faiths, but the Book of Mormon speaks specifically about what's going to happen to America.
[02:12:27.407 --> 02:12:28.328]  Okay, Omar, listen.
[02:12:28.768 --> 02:12:32.271]  If you don't have a question for Lindsey Williams, I appreciate your call.
[02:12:32.831 --> 02:12:35.854]  I'm not here debating different religions and different faiths with people.
[02:12:36.846 --> 02:12:37.246]  Okay.
[02:12:37.906 --> 02:12:41.948]  We're here talking about what Lindsey Williams was told by this individual.
[02:12:42.909 --> 02:12:45.350]  And last caller is Jen in Pennsylvania.
[02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:46.970]  Jen, you're on the air from Pennsylvania.
[02:12:48.111 --> 02:12:48.551]  Hi there.
[02:12:50.131 --> 02:12:52.112]  I just want to make a comment.
[02:12:52.252 --> 02:12:53.693]  First-time caller.
[02:12:54.653 --> 02:13:02.376]  But I had a revelation just the other day, and it may be on the table at some point in time.
[02:13:02.717 --> 02:13:03.357]  An epiphany.
[02:13:03.377 --> 02:13:03.717]  Go ahead.
[02:13:06.417 --> 02:13:08.779]  It's the birthday of Christ.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.363]  September 11th, 2003 was the birthday of Christ, B.C.
[02:13:15.244 --> 02:13:22.609]  And so, if that means anything as far as where we're at and why that particular day was chosen.
[02:13:22.729 --> 02:13:26.112]  Ma'am, I mean, as close as we know with the calendars, A.D.
[02:13:26.192 --> 02:13:27.233]  is after death.
[02:13:28.013 --> 02:13:29.815]  So how would 03 be his birthday?
[02:13:30.875 --> 02:13:31.376]  B.C.
[02:13:32.036 --> 02:13:32.657]  Oh, B.C.
[02:13:32.697 --> 02:13:33.658]  I missed what you were saying.
[02:13:33.738 --> 02:13:33.958]  Okay.
[02:13:34.673 --> 02:13:36.814]  Yeah, with September 11th.
[02:13:37.114 --> 02:13:40.416]  Wouldn't that be 33 B.C.?
[02:13:40.776 --> 02:13:45.019]  From what I have seen in the research.
[02:13:45.079 --> 02:13:47.860]  Do you have a question for Lindsay?
[02:13:49.421 --> 02:13:50.562]  I just wanted to make a comment.
[02:13:50.602 --> 02:13:54.024]  Ernest Martin's book, Star of Bethlehem, it just is significant.
[02:13:54.064 --> 02:13:57.946]  I thought today would be a good day to call, so basically if anybody wants to find
[02:13:58.447 --> 02:14:00.489]  The information, it's out there.
[02:14:00.589 --> 02:14:02.731]  Okay, thank you, and I'm not trying to be frustrated with you.
[02:14:03.111 --> 02:14:06.994]  It's that we have limited time, and I just wanted to get questions for Lindsey, but thank you so much.
[02:14:07.515 --> 02:14:08.615]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:09.776 --> 02:14:17.943]  Lindsey, briefly, and I appreciate you coming on, you have a six DVD set, three of them are new, on this whole subject with your conversation a few weeks ago with this gentleman.
[02:14:18.744 --> 02:14:22.467]  Please give people, quickly, the toll-free number if they want to call and get that.
[02:14:23.348 --> 02:14:27.451]  When you call my new toll-free number, you will get an American operator.
[02:14:27.972 --> 02:14:31.993]  The number is 888-799-6111.
[02:14:32.013 --> 02:14:41.294]  We have seven operators standing by right now, and if you want to go to the web, go to prophecyclub.com.
[02:14:41.334 --> 02:14:44.695]  P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y-C-O-U-B.com again.
[02:14:45.355 --> 02:14:47.575]  Toll-free number, new toll-free number, 888-799-6111.
[02:14:47.795 --> 02:14:48.616]  Six new DVDs, and Alex,
[02:14:56.741 --> 02:15:06.029]  I want to say emphatically, the most startling information you will find anywhere on the face of this earth today is, number one, fall of the republic.
[02:15:06.670 --> 02:15:16.018]  The second most startling information I guarantee you'll ever hear is what this elite told me only days ago in my three new DVD series, the number is 888.
[02:15:20.587 --> 02:15:22.528]  Okay, Lindsey, we're out of time.
[02:15:22.568 --> 02:15:24.909]  We'll talk to you again soon, Lord Willin.
[02:15:25.249 --> 02:15:26.969]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:15:27.749 --> 02:15:28.450]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:15:29.210 --> 02:15:29.630]  Thank you.
[02:15:29.690 --> 02:15:30.150]  Take care.
[02:15:31.211 --> 02:15:33.011]  There goes Lindsey Williams, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:33.671 --> 02:15:36.853]  I have two sponsors, I want to thank, that made the last couple hours possible.
[02:15:36.873 --> 02:15:38.933]  We're going to come back in the final segment.
[02:15:38.973 --> 02:15:41.794]  I'm going to blitz through this stack of news.
[02:15:42.935 --> 02:15:44.115]  Just going through the headlines.
[02:15:44.555 --> 02:15:45.996]  That is coming up in the final segment.
[02:15:46.056 --> 02:15:46.776]  Stay with us for that.
[02:15:48.339 --> 02:15:52.840]  Before I end this segment, I want to tell you about two great sponsors we have.
[02:15:53.481 --> 02:15:55.261]  One of them is silverlungs.com.
[02:15:55.301 --> 02:15:58.162]  That's silverlungs.com.
[02:15:58.202 --> 02:16:09.425]  The Silver Lungs Generator Trademark is a highly cost-effective colloidal silver generator and lung delivery system that produces pure and endless colloidal silver and delivers the solution directly to the bloodstream.
[02:16:09.765 --> 02:16:14.587]  Check out their latest audio archive answering the most commonly asked questions at silverlungs.com.
[02:16:15.067 --> 02:16:17.528]  Now you can finally make sense out of what colloidal silver is.
[02:16:18.248 --> 02:16:19.128]  And how it works.
[02:16:19.769 --> 02:16:23.270]  Visit their link on PrisonPlanet.com or go to SilverLungs.com.
[02:16:23.630 --> 02:16:27.832]  That's SilverLungs, L-U-N-G-S dot com.
[02:16:29.512 --> 02:16:34.194]  Continuing with EcuadorCentral.com, like the South American country.
[02:16:35.416 --> 02:16:38.938]  It is your duty to know every option you have to protect you and your family.
[02:16:39.318 --> 02:16:46.523]  Whether you are looking for a rental property, a new start, or you just want to know your options, I urge you to go to EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:16:47.123 --> 02:16:48.204]  This website is great.
[02:16:48.644 --> 02:16:51.445]  It will give you all the information you want to know before you go.
[02:16:54.997 --> 02:16:58.058]  Go to EcuadorCentral.com and see what these folks are doing.
[02:16:58.518 --> 02:17:04.120]  Whether you are interested in real estate investment, travel, or just want to see pictures and videos, go to EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:17:04.460 --> 02:17:05.741]  That's the country, Ecuador.
[02:17:06.061 --> 02:17:08.102]  EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:17:08.662 --> 02:17:11.463]  Ladies and gentlemen, we want to thank those sponsors for making the show possible.
[02:17:11.883 --> 02:17:13.944]  I'm not going to do any plugs here in the final segment.
[02:17:13.964 --> 02:17:14.864]  I just want to say again,
[02:17:15.868 --> 02:17:28.812]  That yes, Fall of the Republic, even though there's thousands of versions, over a thousand versions on YouTube alone, one of the videos, it's all diluted by him being everywhere, was on the front page as the number one featured video today.
[02:17:28.832 --> 02:17:29.612]  I don't know if it still is.
[02:17:29.652 --> 02:17:30.812]  Let's go to YouTube and see if it is.
[02:17:32.433 --> 02:17:37.954]  I try to recoup making the $200,000 film, and let me tell you, being free on the web doesn't do that.
[02:17:38.955 --> 02:17:43.576]  So please buy the high quality DVD and other films like Endgame,
[02:17:44.992 --> 02:17:53.179]  And Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, if you want to know the religion of the elite, all that at InfoWars.com, because that pays for what we're doing here.
[02:17:53.299 --> 02:17:57.502]  And PrisonPlanet.tv, it's in higher quality there than it is in YouTube, and easier to download.
[02:17:57.522 --> 02:17:59.824]  But yes, the film is free on YouTube right now.
[02:18:00.105 --> 02:18:01.366]  Get the link, get it out to everybody.
[02:18:03.550 --> 02:18:10.154]  If you're tired of paying too much for gas, diesel, or heating oil, Future Fuel Technologies has the answer you're looking for.
[02:18:10.454 --> 02:18:12.195]  It's called FFT Fuel Saver.
[02:18:12.575 --> 02:18:23.381]  FFT Fuel Saver is made using a patented formula that helps fuel burn cleaner, resulting in a 10-20% increase in fuel efficiency, and reduces emissions 30% or more.
[02:18:23.701 --> 02:18:25.162]  Each bottle of FFT Fuel
[02:18:28.510 --> 02:18:29.110]  We're good to go!
[02:18:58.793 --> 02:19:07.902]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:19:08.263 --> 02:19:11.246]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:19:11.506 --> 02:19:12.908]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:19:13.607 --> 02:19:16.268]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:19:16.288 --> 02:19:22.510]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:19:22.670 --> 02:19:27.692]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:19:27.712 --> 02:19:37.835]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:19:37.955 --> 02:19:40.075]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:19:40.316 --> 02:19:41.636]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:19:41.896 --> 02:19:44.176]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:19:44.356 --> 02:19:46.197]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:19:46.497 --> 02:19:51.238]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:19:51.638 --> 02:19:56.399]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:19:56.639 --> 02:20:00.740]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:20:06.178 --> 02:20:09.121]  Times are tough, and many of us expect them to get worse.
[02:20:09.401 --> 02:20:12.364]  The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[02:20:12.564 --> 02:20:15.207]  Therefore, you have no excuse not to be prepared.
[02:20:15.547 --> 02:20:21.493]  If another Great Depression strikes America, how will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones?
[02:20:21.973 --> 02:20:25.076]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food.
[02:20:25.516 --> 02:20:27.258]  Patriotfood.com is different.
[02:20:27.728 --> 02:20:31.751]  Because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[02:20:32.031 --> 02:20:38.955]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty, food-grade plastic bags that will last 10 years.
[02:20:39.135 --> 02:20:41.477]  While our competition charges $3,000, we ship to you 135 pounds
[02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:46.680]  Alright, final segment.
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:48.081]  We're gonna move quick here.
[02:21:11.624 --> 02:21:16.045]  Ron Paul has some key articles that we have up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:21:16.625 --> 02:21:19.006]  Anything less than full disclosure is unacceptable.
[02:21:19.626 --> 02:21:30.809]  The Senate has entered audit the Fed counterfeits that don't audit the private run for profit.
[02:21:31.209 --> 02:21:33.549]  Federal Reserve and Ron Paul has an editorial about it.
[02:21:34.029 --> 02:21:36.210]  Anything less than full disclosure is unacceptable.
[02:21:37.571 --> 02:21:38.832]  Another Ron Paul report here.
[02:21:38.892 --> 02:21:43.395]  Ron Paul questions why Obama daughters haven't taken swine flu vaccine.
[02:21:43.955 --> 02:21:45.616]  And he makes the point that that's going on.
[02:21:45.636 --> 02:21:48.899]  It's a Paul Watson article with a video clip on that.
[02:21:48.919 --> 02:21:49.299]  That's right.
[02:21:49.319 --> 02:21:49.979]  They won't take it.
[02:21:50.039 --> 02:21:53.882]  The German government gets and the German army gets a clean flu vaccine.
[02:21:54.382 --> 02:21:57.544]  Government may block websites during pandemic.
[02:21:58.125 --> 02:21:59.185]  This is from Reuters.
[02:21:59.766 --> 02:22:01.487]  And they're saying they're going to do this for our safety.
[02:22:01.507 --> 02:22:07.131]  If there's a big crisis, they're going to shut down the web traffic so you can only get the government messages.
[02:22:07.851 --> 02:22:16.022]  Another report, proposed Obama bill would give government power to dismantle and control, I would add the financial industry, Capitol Hill, blue.
[02:22:16.503 --> 02:22:24.274]  That's what the new banker bailout does, is give them not unlimited money, they already got that in the last bill, but unlimited power to even manage your hot dog stand.
[02:22:24.634 --> 02:22:29.760]  And I first covered that reading the bill, but even Judge Napolitano has done reports documenting that's what it says.
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:31.562]  Circulation drops at U.S.
[02:22:31.622 --> 02:22:35.366]  newspapers as readers turn to online news sources.
[02:22:35.406 --> 02:22:37.529]  There's the link to the Los Angeles Times.
[02:22:37.569 --> 02:22:43.255]  The newspapers are just completely imploding, mainly because they're a bunch of propaganda and spin.
[02:22:44.136 --> 02:22:46.237]  Castro's sister worked for the CIA.
[02:22:46.637 --> 02:22:48.938]  The CIA now admits, so did Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:22:48.958 --> 02:22:53.039]  That's recently been declassified, though they still have kept most of it classified.
[02:22:53.059 --> 02:22:58.181]  Of course, turns out that Benito Mussolini was British intelligence, MI5, and so was Adolf Hitler.
[02:22:58.601 --> 02:23:00.041]  London Guardian reporting on that.
[02:23:00.521 --> 02:23:03.242]  Fewer illegal migrants flown to Mexico.
[02:23:03.682 --> 02:23:10.925]  The Department of Homeland Security, the Arizona Republic reports, has massively cut back the number of illegal aliens they're arresting and deporting.
[02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:12.500]  That's right.
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:17.283]  The slave grids to keep the American people in, not new slaves out.
[02:23:17.323 --> 02:23:18.243]  They want more slaves.
[02:23:19.223 --> 02:23:25.486]  Obama's H1N1 national pandemic declaration could invoke FEMA response to pandemic, and that's now beginning.
[02:23:26.367 --> 02:23:30.249]  Helicopter crashes killing 14 Americans in Afghanistan.
[02:23:30.269 --> 02:23:33.730]  They're hiding a lot of deaths, claiming they're having daily helicopter crashes.
[02:23:34.090 --> 02:23:39.333]  Certainly some of those are true, but one of their favorite ways to hide the true death toll, especially when they're about to increase troops,
[02:23:40.093 --> 02:23:42.014]  Is by claiming it was all air accidents.
[02:23:43.435 --> 02:23:46.077]  Morale dips for American Marines in Afghanistan.
[02:23:46.377 --> 02:23:51.200]  And they're saying because the Marines won't want the war to continue and want more troops.
[02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:54.702]  Oh, if you support the troops, keep them in the meat grinder guarding the opium.
[02:23:55.083 --> 02:23:56.483]  No, if you support them, bring them home.
[02:23:57.344 --> 02:23:59.565]  Bosnia on the brink of new civil war.
[02:23:59.605 --> 02:24:00.866]  The London Telegraph reports.
[02:24:00.906 --> 02:24:01.847]  That's good for the globalists.
[02:24:03.083 --> 02:24:05.384]  Bo Dietl talks about the new world order on Fox News.
[02:24:05.724 --> 02:24:09.985]  Don Imus on Fox News Business shuts him down when Bo Dietl talks about world government.
[02:24:10.365 --> 02:24:11.885]  We've really woken up, Bo.
[02:24:12.205 --> 02:24:14.286]  He's in Truth Rising talking about bombs in the buildings.
[02:24:14.686 --> 02:24:18.887]  What a turnaround for Bo Dietl, the famous New York detective.
[02:24:19.507 --> 02:24:20.028]  Tough guy.
[02:24:20.548 --> 02:24:24.869]  Swine flu scam reaches new heights with Obama's emergency declaration.
[02:24:24.909 --> 02:24:25.549]  Just covered that.
[02:24:26.029 --> 02:24:31.371]  Medicare fraud raises troubling questions about our government's ability to manage a medical bureaucracy.
[02:24:31.651 --> 02:24:32.071]  But you see,
[02:24:33.325 --> 02:24:34.626]  The government wants fraud.
[02:24:34.686 --> 02:24:43.172]  They want the programs to be overwhelmed so the government borrows more money from the banks that just make it up out of nowhere but get interest and real assets back.
[02:24:43.572 --> 02:24:49.196]  That's why they want the states bankrupt and the federal government bankrupt and always spin, spin, spin us into their control.
[02:24:49.597 --> 02:25:00.925]  The total police state of Afghanistan with the admitted puppet Mohammed Karzai staging the last election, Afghan police and kin-state type activity, open fire on demonstrators, killing a whole bunch of them.
[02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:05.303]  Podesta suggests legalizing pot and taxing it.
[02:25:05.583 --> 02:25:10.369]  Marijuana is not like heroin or cocaine that the government controls and launders and ships in.
[02:25:10.689 --> 02:25:15.374]  It can be grown everywhere and it's one of the few drugs that the government doesn't control.
[02:25:15.894 --> 02:25:21.400]  And so they want to start taxing it just like Prozac, just like the lottery, just like prostitution in Nevada.
[02:25:21.661 --> 02:25:23.082]  They want their stinking cut of it.
[02:25:23.883 --> 02:25:25.945]  That is it for this radio transmission.
[02:25:26.025 --> 02:25:27.627]  Great job with the crew today.
[02:25:27.647 --> 02:25:29.328]  Hip hip hooray!
[02:25:29.348 --> 02:25:32.111]  Retransmission starts in 20 seconds.
[02:25:32.271 --> 02:25:32.752]  One place.
[02:25:32.892 --> 02:25:34.053]  InfoWars.com.
[02:25:34.273 --> 02:25:36.355]  And the podcast should be back up for folks today.
[02:25:36.375 --> 02:25:37.536]  See you back live tomorrow.
[02:25:37.576 --> 02:25:38.878]  More powerful guests and info.
[02:25:42.221 --> 02:25:44.283]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:25:44.823 --> 02:25:45.244]  Be sure to...
