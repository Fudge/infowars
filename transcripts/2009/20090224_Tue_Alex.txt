[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.329]  We're good to go.
[00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:26.916]  We've got a state senator from Texas making national headlines about putting state forces on the border as Mexico collapses.
[00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:28.638]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[00:00:28.658 --> 00:00:38.148]  A little bit later, I'm going to play this clip that's up on PrisonPlanet.com, and that clip deals
[00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:51.637]  With the fact that the Federal Reserve minions walk over to a camera person and tell them that they aren't allowed to videotape a local camera crew.
[00:00:52.097 --> 00:00:54.378]  In fact, we have that clip now.
[00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:57.018]  Let's go ahead and cut over here to this shot.
[00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.400]  And then we're going to go ahead and go to this video for folks.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.120]  So here it is.
[00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:13.899]  Right here, live on Prison Planet dot TV.
[00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:21.603]  What's that?
[00:01:21.703 --> 00:01:25.966]  You need to go through public affairs.
[00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:27.487]  No, I'm just getting some security shots.
[00:01:27.527 --> 00:01:30.288]  No, you need to go through public affairs for you to videotape or take pictures.
[00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:31.009]  Of any federal building?
[00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.729]  Of any federal building.
[00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.150]  Stop!
[00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.290]  Stop!
[00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.430]  Stop!
[00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.590]  Stop!
[00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.770]  Stop!
[00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.611]  I mean this is so incredible in America to see this.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.423]  You can even go across the street, but we'll still come over there.
[00:02:05.443 --> 00:02:10.568]  There's no law, and she says, you know, we may snatch your camera, like a third world country.
[00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.630]  Snatch you!
[00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.912]  And I had this happen to me all over D.C.
[00:02:14.032 --> 00:02:15.594]  and I'd say, look, there's no law and you know it.
[00:02:16.996 --> 00:02:20.359]  And the larger issue of what they do is
[00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:29.157]  Tell you then to come sign up with them, and then they just don't answer your calls or don't return calls.
[00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:34.120]  Because Seethink, a film production company for Independent Film Channel, was following us around when we were in D.C.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.062]  last year, and they had tried to get permits.
[00:02:38.102 --> 00:02:39.183]  There's no permits issued.
[00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:43.045]  Permits are only for inside the buildings, because it's a First Amendment issue.
[00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:43.725]  It's been litigated.
[00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:45.266]  But they don't care.
[00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:50.289]  They still come out, and they still enforce this on everyone.
[00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.670]  And you've got to ask yourselves why, because they're setting the precedent.
[00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.330]  This is just like a third world country, or Soviet Russia, or Nazi Germany.
[00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.931]  And the public has been trained like cowards to just do what they say.
[00:03:02.151 --> 00:03:03.251]  Let's go ahead and go back to the clip.
[00:03:08.412 --> 00:03:16.253]  The picture, they're not going to snatch your camera, but if you come up with something like that, they're going to approach you and they're going to ask you what you're doing, they're going to ask you for ID, all that good stuff.
[00:03:17.454 --> 00:03:18.314]  Okay?
[00:03:18.434 --> 00:03:19.794]  What if I was wearing like a press badge?
[00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:23.404]  Now, if you did that, they're going to ask you, who's your contact person?
[00:03:23.424 --> 00:03:25.145]  Because then you should have contacted Public Affairs.
[00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:26.746]  The Fed?
[00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:27.327]  Public Affairs?
[00:03:27.387 --> 00:03:29.349]  Or just like... Public Affairs for the Federal Reserve.
[00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.831]  So, for every building I need to contact that Public Affairs person?
[00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:33.172]  Yes, sir.
[00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.153]  Even if it's just to shoot for the public sidewalk?
[00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:35.514]  Yes, sir.
[00:03:36.434 --> 00:03:37.175]  I did not know that.
[00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:37.675]  Yes, sir.
[00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:38.977]  Is that new?
[00:03:39.297 --> 00:03:40.498]  No, it's always been like that.
[00:03:41.078 --> 00:03:44.241]  Now, there's tourists that come through here, snap a picture, and keep on going.
[00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:45.502]  Yeah, and you deal about it?
[00:03:45.562 --> 00:03:47.724]  No, as long as they take a picture and keep on going,
[00:03:48.024 --> 00:03:51.627]  But when you come up with a video camera like that, that's when we come out and get you.
[00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:55.571]  Because I've shot like tons of guns and you're the first person to ever approach me.
[00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:56.912]  They probably never paid attention to you.
[00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:02.517]  Edwin Vieira coming up and get his take on it.
[00:04:03.078 --> 00:04:05.020]  But this is us being slaves.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.542]  She's talking to this guy like he's a bad two-year-old child.
[00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:09.884]  How dare you in America videotape this?
[00:04:09.904 --> 00:04:13.548]  But we're going to videotape everything you do and listen to your phone calls without warrants.
[00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:18.379]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:24.082]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:04:24.202 --> 00:04:28.265]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.

[00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:37.472]  I don't know.

[00:05:42.488 --> 00:05:44.208]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:05:44.248 --> 00:05:49.989]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.711]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[00:06:21.244 --> 00:06:31.731]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.

[00:06:54.972 --> 00:06:57.014]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[00:06:58.395 --> 00:07:01.598]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.661]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:06.903]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:22.019]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:25.587]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:35.810]  Dr. Edwin Vieira has a long bio, has won courses and cases as a constitutional attorney before the Supreme Court and other major courts.
[00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.996]  He is a staunch defender of the Second Amendment and of constitutional money.
[00:07:42.917 --> 00:07:48.704]  And we've got him here to cover a host of issues today for the next 51 minutes that we have left in this hour.
[00:07:51.997 --> 00:08:00.361]  But, sir, just for those who have just joined us for the first time or may not know who you are, briefly, for listeners, what's most important for folks to know about yourself?
[00:08:02.622 --> 00:08:11.866]  Well, that I have been studying problems of constitutional law for more than 30 years now, focusing to a very large degree on monetary matters.
[00:08:11.906 --> 00:08:19.769]  And then, let me say, in the last, oh, probably 10 years total, looking into questions of
[00:08:20.558 --> 00:08:26.581]  The Constitutional Militia, and then more specifically after 9-11, the whole area of what's called Homeland Security.
[00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:38.086]  And then the intersection of those two matters, which when you study it, Alex, it really tends to bring in or sweep in all of the basic principles of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
[00:08:38.867 --> 00:08:50.372]  They're intimately tied in to those areas because I like to tell people, you look at money and the militia or that whole Homeland Security problem, one of the two fundamental powers of government that you're talking about.
[00:08:50.868 --> 00:09:04.076]  The power of the purse and the power of the sword, which anyone who is well-versed in political philosophy realizes historically have always been considered to be the premier powers of government, of any kind of government.
[00:09:04.216 --> 00:09:09.900]  Well, you are accredited as being in the top ten constitutional law scholars out there, so you can speak to all these issues.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.763]  I want to get into the now upwards of 30 with Alabama declaring a pro-Second Amendment
[00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.571]  Bill that's been introduced.
[00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:26.536]  States are passing these bills saying no to the feds, bringing up the martial law, bringing up the gun confiscation plans, bringing up the presidential decision directives.
[00:09:26.896 --> 00:09:31.519]  Very exciting to see the state reps and state senators informed on what's going on.
[00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:32.920]  We have one joining us next hour.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.042]  But before we do that, before you joined us, I played a clip of a
[00:09:38.243 --> 00:09:47.004]  Online News Agency, videotaping from the sidewalk the Federal Reserve in D.C., which I've done myself, the private Federal Reserve, and the Federal...
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.943]  Reserve minion who's not a federal police officer comes over and says, you can't film across the street.
[00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:55.104]  You know, we'll come harass you there.
[00:09:55.164 --> 00:09:56.085]  You can't film here.
[00:09:56.465 --> 00:09:57.766]  You've got to get permission from us.
[00:09:57.786 --> 00:10:04.911]  Well, I just so happen to know that a film crew tried to get permission to film out front of the Federal Reserve when they told them that from the Independent Film Channel, and they were told no.
[00:10:05.531 --> 00:10:07.893]  So they're turning a right into a privilege.
[00:10:08.553 --> 00:10:14.197]  I want to play you a clip of this, this audio, and then get your response to what you hear.
[00:10:14.237 --> 00:10:18.300]  This is during the confrontation where he's standing at the fence.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:25.082]  And she's behind it, you know, telling him that he can't be there filming.
[00:10:25.602 --> 00:10:26.442]  Here's a little bit of that.
[00:10:27.402 --> 00:10:34.524]  They're not going to snatch your camera, but if you come up with something like that, they're going to approach you and they're going to ask you what you're doing, they're going to ask you for ID, all that good stuff.
[00:10:35.684 --> 00:10:36.564]  Okay?
[00:10:36.664 --> 00:10:38.065]  What if I was wearing, like, a press badge?
[00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:43.366]  Now, if you did that, they're going to ask you who's your contact person, because then you should have contacted Public Affairs.
[00:10:44.153 --> 00:10:47.556]  Um, the Fed Public Affairs or just like... Public Affairs for the Federal Reserve.
[00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:51.018]  So, for every building I need to contact that Public Affairs person?
[00:10:51.038 --> 00:10:51.398]  Yes, sir.
[00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:51.859]  Yes, sir.
[00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:53.380]  Even just to shoot from the public sidewalk?
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:53.740]  Yes, sir.
[00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:55.401]  I did not know that.
[00:10:55.461 --> 00:10:55.902]  Yes, sir.
[00:10:56.462 --> 00:10:57.203]  Uh, is that new?
[00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:58.744]  No, it's always been like that.
[00:10:59.264 --> 00:11:02.467]  Now, there's tourists that come through here, snap a picture and keep on going.
[00:11:02.507 --> 00:11:03.768]  Yeah, and you do about it?
[00:11:03.808 --> 00:11:05.969]  No, as long as they take a picture and keep on going.
[00:11:06.229 --> 00:11:09.592]  But when you come up with a video camera like that, that's when we come out and get you.
[00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:13.802]  Because I've shot like tons of billions and you're the first person to ever approach me.
[00:11:13.822 --> 00:11:15.243]  They probably never paid attention to you.
[00:11:16.123 --> 00:11:17.484]  But this is the Federal Reserve.
[00:11:19.185 --> 00:11:19.346]  Okay?
[00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:20.106]  Is that bigger?
[00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:21.727]  What do you mean?
[00:11:21.767 --> 00:11:22.188]  What do you mean?
[00:11:22.508 --> 00:11:23.769]  You don't know what the Federal Reserve is?
[00:11:24.626 --> 00:11:26.567]  Okay, who do you work for?
[00:11:26.927 --> 00:11:27.948]  The American News Project.
[00:11:27.968 --> 00:11:31.330]  What I mean is, I've shot the White House and the Capitol building.
[00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.310]  And they never approached you?
[00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:32.871]  No.
[00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:34.672]  I can't even see them being popular.
[00:11:34.692 --> 00:11:35.532]  Or the Treasury Building.
[00:11:35.892 --> 00:11:37.453]  You know, standing there where all the public walks.
[00:11:37.513 --> 00:11:38.654]  Just standing right there on the sidewalk.
[00:11:38.674 --> 00:11:39.134]  Taking pictures.
[00:11:39.535 --> 00:11:41.095]  You know, just getting some B-roll digs there.
[00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:47.319]  I've never had anybody... But now, in order for you to take pictures of this building or any kind of videotape, you have to go through public affairs.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.400]  Well... Okay.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.881]  Alright, uh...
[00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:54.359]  So I can't just use your shots here?
[00:11:54.379 --> 00:11:54.959]  No sir.
[00:11:54.979 --> 00:11:55.879]  Alright.
[00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:58.340]  And what about the shots that I've already shot?
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.000]  Can I use those?
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.300]  I have nothing to do with what you've done shot already.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:01.960]  Right.
[00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:02.801]  Okay.
[00:12:04.461 --> 00:12:05.121]  Okay.
[00:12:05.781 --> 00:12:07.902]  Is there like up security here at the Federal Reserve?
[00:12:08.062 --> 00:12:08.462]  Is it up?
[00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:09.702]  No, it's always been like this.
[00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:11.163]  Alright, stop right there.
[00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:12.956]  This is classic.
[00:12:12.996 --> 00:12:21.921]  It's not just feds and federal security guards at the Supreme Court and everywhere else I've been coming across the street or the White House or the Washington Monument saying, you can't film it.
[00:12:22.621 --> 00:12:23.282]  You can't film it.
[00:12:23.322 --> 00:12:24.522]  And I said, go ahead and arrest me.
[00:12:24.542 --> 00:12:25.863]  You know it's a color of law and a fraud.
[00:12:25.883 --> 00:12:26.903]  I'm going to have to sue you.
[00:12:26.923 --> 00:12:27.624]  And they back off.
[00:12:28.144 --> 00:12:29.265]  They know they're making this up.
[00:12:29.505 --> 00:12:37.449]  They've been told to go out and create this legalese and try to create some type of common law precedence to just have us as slaves
[00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:54.181]  Accept it, but with this it's even sweeter because she's saying, in the earlier part of the clip, this is a Federal Reserve, Federal building, but it's not a Federal Reserve, it's not a Federal building, and there she is behind her little fence, telling him that even if you go across the street, we're going to come over and might snatch your camera.
[00:12:54.902 --> 00:13:01.667]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, as a constitutional attorney and law scholar, who's, again, won before the Supreme Court, what is this we're witnessing?
[00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:07.812]  Well, I'm not exactly sure what the motivation is, although I think it's probably a sinister one.
[00:13:09.542 --> 00:13:19.869]  Also, I've seen instances where this type of argument has been made about taking photographs of police engaged in activities on a public street and arrests and so forth.
[00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:36.660]  Primarily, I suppose they're concerned about being sued for police brutality, but nonetheless, I cannot imagine the constitutional justification for saying that someone standing on a public sidewalk cannot take a photograph of any building
[00:13:37.563 --> 00:13:38.963]  Within Washington, D.C.
[00:13:39.343 --> 00:13:40.104]  I mean, any building.
[00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:43.764]  What's funny about this is I put out a book several years ago called Crashmaker.
[00:13:43.784 --> 00:13:48.265]  It's a semi-fictionalized novel of a collapse of the Federal Reserve System.
[00:13:48.766 --> 00:13:57.688]  And on the cover of that book is a stylized drawing of the Federal Reserve, the old Federal Reserve building on Constitution Avenue.
[00:13:58.148 --> 00:14:04.169]  And that was taken from a photograph, or a number of photographs that I took, actually on their plaza.
[00:14:05.217 --> 00:14:05.717]  We're good to go.
[00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:30.187]  Shoot it from a public street?
[00:14:30.407 --> 00:14:36.369]  Well, her capacity is a Federal Reserve police officer in a literal Storm Trooper outfit with a gold buckle.
[00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:42.872]  I mean, it's the closest uniform I've seen people wearing that's the closest to a Nazi uniform I've ever seen.
[00:14:43.892 --> 00:14:51.535]  Well, then she's some kind of private security officer because the Federal Reserve System obviously is not a governmental entity.
[00:14:51.576 --> 00:14:52.636]  Board of Governors might be.
[00:14:53.377 --> 00:14:53.657]  I don't
[00:15:20.097 --> 00:15:21.838]  And confronted him and said, this couldn't be done.
[00:15:22.178 --> 00:15:24.159]  And he said, show me the law and backed him off.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.300]  Yeah, well, that's right.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:36.326]  But obviously they have some... I mean, there may be some legitimate concern lurking in the background that the people who are taking these photographs are attempting to find some vulnerability in the building.
[00:15:36.346 --> 00:15:37.867]  No, it's ridiculous though.
[00:15:37.987 --> 00:15:39.448]  They're surveilling us.
[00:15:40.348 --> 00:15:51.937]  But I mean, they're surveilling us everywhere with cameras, and then they just passed a law in England that if you videotape or photograph police, you're going to be charged with terrorism at the officer's discretion.
[00:15:51.977 --> 00:15:53.598]  I mean, this is like the Soviet Union.
[00:15:53.818 --> 00:15:54.359]  Well, that's right.
[00:15:54.499 --> 00:15:57.921]  And I think that this whole business has a positive and a negative sense.
[00:15:58.262 --> 00:16:02.945]  They want you to get used to their cameras and their constant surveillance.
[00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:07.929]  And on the other hand, they want you not to be recording what they're doing.
[00:16:09.224 --> 00:16:22.248]  Because that, of course, is what turns up in evidence in civil rights cases, and police brutality cases, and perhaps criminal cases, in which someone is charged with something and the videotaping of the event shows that exactly the opposite happened.
[00:16:22.308 --> 00:16:38.253]  Yeah, they're definitely scared of cameras, and we saw when they murdered that guy execution style in the Bay Area, shooting him in the back, they confiscated two cameras, two phone cameras, they said that the cameras, the government cameras, malfunctioned, but then people in a train
[00:16:39.173 --> 00:16:45.156]  And down the way, did videotape, even them taking cameras, and then it came out that they were trying to cover up the murder.
[00:16:45.656 --> 00:16:49.718]  So, uh, they're not gonna be able to stop this, uh, unless... Oh, no, no, no.
[00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:51.599]  And that's the only reason for it.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:52.940]  Let's face the fact.
[00:16:53.573 --> 00:17:08.940]  The only possible reason, leaving aside the mystical theory that a terrorist would use some videotape of the IRS building to commit an act of terrorism, the only reason for this is to be able to cover up official misconduct.
[00:17:11.081 --> 00:17:13.982]  And boss the people around and train us to be slaves.
[00:17:14.183 --> 00:17:15.903]  Well that's the other side, watching you.
[00:17:15.963 --> 00:17:19.245]  But I mean in terms of photographing them, the only reason
[00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.511]  Is to cover up official misconduct.
[00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.511]  Telling them what, Alex?
[00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:41.972]  Telling them you can't photograph.
[00:17:41.992 --> 00:17:51.659]  We would be in the grass, across the street, on the other side from the White House, and we had White House police come over and tell us we can't film.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.922]  And I'd say, I said, this is the First Amendment.
[00:17:56.142 --> 00:17:57.123]  Oh, let me have your press pass.
[00:17:57.523 --> 00:17:59.204]  I go, buddy, you know it's the First Amendment.
[00:17:59.665 --> 00:18:00.946]  And I said, do what you gotta do.
[00:18:01.266 --> 00:18:04.168]  So then they had Secret Service follow us around all day in D.C.
[00:18:04.368 --> 00:18:06.750]  because we dare not get down and just start licking the boots.
[00:18:08.627 --> 00:18:12.009]  Which tends to suggest that they had nothing better to do with the Secret Service.
[00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:16.011]  Why aren't they out searching for those terrorists lurking in the back alleys of D.C.?
[00:18:18.112 --> 00:18:20.693]  Well, we know now... They don't have time to harass the average person!
[00:18:21.594 --> 00:18:23.354]  What does that tell you about the war on terror?
[00:18:23.835 --> 00:18:28.817]  What does that tell you about their attitude and how bankrupt the government is and how thuggish it is?
[00:18:30.518 --> 00:18:32.039]  Well, I think we know that already.
[00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:36.361]  But, I mean, I'm just looking at the excuse that they give us for all this thuggishness.
[00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:38.831]  And what are they spending their time doing?
[00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:42.416]  Are you talking about harassing tourists at the Lincoln Memorial?
[00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:44.078]  It's unbelievable, sir.
[00:18:44.118 --> 00:18:54.912]  They just... Boss, you'll have like a sidewalk by a park with a family eating ice cream cones, and the police go, you can't block the sidewalk, move along, move along, and the father's like... And then they all grovel and the police go...
[00:18:56.424 --> 00:18:58.247]  And they got private security guards doing it.
[00:18:59.068 --> 00:18:59.990]  You couldn't believe it.
[00:19:00.711 --> 00:19:02.513]  And it was just off the charts.
[00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:04.095]  Stay there, sir.
[00:19:04.115 --> 00:19:08.081]  I want to come back and get into the state's rights movement, which you've been pushing for for a long time.
[00:19:08.722 --> 00:19:10.004]  Dr. Evan Vieira is our guest.

[00:20:14.785 --> 00:20:21.168]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:21.528 --> 00:20:23.229]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:24.184 --> 00:20:25.205]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:26.225]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:26.526 --> 00:20:27.506]  This is his M.O.
[00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:28.807]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:28.867 --> 00:20:30.508]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:30.888 --> 00:20:37.633]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:38.033 --> 00:20:38.473]  Some U.S.
[00:20:38.513 --> 00:20:44.157]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:44.857 --> 00:20:48.340]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.161]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:17.492]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:17.892 --> 00:21:23.376]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:23.956 --> 00:21:24.436]  That's right.
[00:21:24.777 --> 00:21:27.038]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:27.618 --> 00:21:34.583]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:35.103 --> 00:21:40.767]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs.
[00:21:41.249 --> 00:21:42.769]  Yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:43.229 --> 00:21:48.091]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:48.711 --> 00:21:53.712]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.512 --> 00:21:58.633]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[00:22:01.294 --> 00:22:01.594]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.150]  Come, you masters of war.
[00:23:08.171 --> 00:23:08.971]  Here to build the big guns.
[00:23:25.373 --> 00:23:26.354]  We are back live.
[00:23:26.414 --> 00:23:28.335]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:23:28.836 --> 00:23:30.237]  Dr. Evan Vieira is our guest.
[00:23:30.257 --> 00:23:31.598]  We'll give you his website before he leaves us.
[00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:35.201]  Okay, let's get right into upwards of 30 states now.
[00:23:35.221 --> 00:23:38.264]  And we've got an Alabama representative coming on in the next few days.
[00:23:38.284 --> 00:23:40.125]  We've got a state senator from Texas coming on.
[00:23:40.546 --> 00:23:44.129]  Multiple bills in Texas, including telling the feds, hey, you're not protecting the borders.
[00:23:44.469 --> 00:23:45.430]  The state's going to do it.
[00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:49.451]  The states, as you know, but the listeners may not, created the federal government.
[00:23:49.592 --> 00:23:51.632]  It's now been globalized, so it's illegitimate.
[00:23:52.513 --> 00:23:57.415]  You've been pushing for this for a long time, but not just the states, at the county, city level, these committees of safety.
[00:23:57.915 --> 00:24:04.978]  Break down your view and your take, and are you buoyed by the fact that we see a massive states' rights movement going on right now, Doctor?
[00:24:06.419 --> 00:24:14.442]  Well, what's encouraging about it, number one, is that obviously the educational process has worked at the legislative level.
[00:24:15.163 --> 00:24:18.944]  It's state legislators who are pushing this now for the first time.
[00:24:18.984 --> 00:24:21.365]  I mean, you know, you've been pushing it, I've been pushing it.
[00:24:21.445 --> 00:24:33.468]  Private citizens have been out there attempting to convince these folks that the state's position in the constitutional system has to be reinvigorated, if you will, and reinforced, or enforced, really.
[00:24:33.968 --> 00:24:35.429]  And now they're beginning to pick up on this.
[00:24:35.489 --> 00:24:39.390]  Of course, it's the economic circumstances that are doing it, but whatever the reason it's happening.
[00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:49.270]  Uh, the next step is for that to be fleshed out in terms of, uh, to what particular problems of greatest immediate importance, uh, does state sovereignty extend?
[00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:52.333]  You mentioned one of them, obviously, in places like Texas and Arizona.
[00:24:52.353 --> 00:24:55.716]  You have, in New Mexico, you have the illegal immigration problem.
[00:24:55.736 --> 00:25:01.722]  Uh, but there are a number of these, uh, what I would call homeland security, local homeland security problems that they have to deal with.
[00:25:02.523 --> 00:25:03.344]  And then thirdly,
[00:25:04.767 --> 00:25:06.268]  And this is, of course, a sequential matter.
[00:25:06.288 --> 00:25:10.592]  It's not going to come in the same resolution or the same statute that starts the process.
[00:25:11.492 --> 00:25:18.297]  There has to be consideration given to how state sovereignty is going to be enforced.
[00:25:19.038 --> 00:25:27.624]  It's not enough to tell those people in Washington that the states have constitutional authority, that the states are sick and tired of the
[00:25:28.945 --> 00:25:36.811]  General government in Washington interfering with that unconstitutionally and imposing its own attempted control on states and localities.
[00:25:37.432 --> 00:25:52.283]  But there has to be a mechanism for enforcing this limitation on the general government, number one, and essentially making these reserved state powers function again.
[00:25:53.104 --> 00:25:56.026]  And all I would tell people is, well, the Constitution tells us what the answer to that is.
[00:25:57.099 --> 00:26:01.523]  Second Amendment, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[00:26:01.563 --> 00:26:03.685]  And ultimately that's what the Tenth Amendment is looking towards.
[00:26:04.105 --> 00:26:07.608]  A free state, a state with certain kinds of reserved powers.
[00:26:07.828 --> 00:26:10.611]  Powers to the state itself, while powers to the people.
[00:26:11.491 --> 00:26:12.732]  And that's what we've been getting away from.
[00:26:12.772 --> 00:26:14.374]  Now we have to go back to basic principles.
[00:26:14.854 --> 00:26:19.058]  And that basic principle ultimately is that each state has to pass the necessary legislation
[00:26:19.716 --> 00:26:45.912]  To revitalize its malicious structure and bring every adult male and female citizen of that state into that structure in one way or another to make it absolutely clear to those people in Washington that we do not need their interference, we do not want their interference, and they would, I would suspect, look at that kind of a structure and be highly deterred from attempting to push that interference too far.
[00:26:48.885 --> 00:26:51.567]  You know, a lot of people say, oh, this doesn't have a chance.
[00:26:52.428 --> 00:26:53.048]  What can we do?
[00:26:53.128 --> 00:26:58.713]  They have a loser mentality and don't understand it was five percent of the population started and won the Revolutionary War.
[00:26:58.793 --> 00:27:00.134]  You're an expert on that as well.
[00:27:00.855 --> 00:27:13.985]  And that this, we have a great chance if we believe in it and point out how bankrupt and unconstitutional the federal government's activities are right now as they federalize the state police, as they federalize local governments, as they federalize with bills, the
[00:27:15.687 --> 00:27:16.587]  Universities now.
[00:27:16.607 --> 00:27:18.929]  I mean, the Feds are openly taking over.
[00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:26.676]  It is the duty, not just the right, under the Declaration of Independence and the 10th and 9th Amendment, for us to say no and rectify this.
[00:27:27.317 --> 00:27:33.522]  I mean, Time Magazine and Newsweek are openly announcing a new Bank of the World will rule the United States and set all our policies.
[00:27:33.602 --> 00:27:34.643]  We must do this.
[00:27:35.023 --> 00:27:38.246]  We've got 30 states passing or preparing to pass bills.
[00:27:38.666 --> 00:27:40.928]  We need to then put pressure to have those enforced.
[00:27:41.309 --> 00:27:42.610]  I mean, can you speak to the fact that
[00:27:44.123 --> 00:27:45.144]  We can win this thing!
[00:27:45.824 --> 00:27:46.645]  Well, of course we can.
[00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:51.248]  There's no way that some bank of the world can force us to use its currency.
[00:27:51.268 --> 00:27:52.048]  That's an absurdity.
[00:27:52.088 --> 00:27:53.209]  We have to accede to that.
[00:27:53.249 --> 00:27:54.190]  We have to accept it.
[00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.230]  We have to go along with it.
[00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.271]  We have to surrender to them.
[00:27:57.071 --> 00:28:01.073]  The fact of the matter is, we are the vast majority of people in this country.
[00:28:01.093 --> 00:28:09.056]  The other side has a very small number, and the people on that side, probably a large number of them, would change sides in any kind of crisis situation.
[00:28:09.076 --> 00:28:12.337]  They're not ideologically wed to that Leviathan in Washington.
[00:28:12.758 --> 00:28:20.681]  Secondly, we are the people in actual possession of the property and the resources of this country, as well as the ability to exercise, you know, intelligence.
[00:28:20.701 --> 00:28:22.682]  We're the ones who run the machines.
[00:28:23.122 --> 00:28:25.263]  We're the ones that make the society function.
[00:28:26.257 --> 00:28:31.404]  So if the vast majority is in possession of the real resources, why are we so worried about them?
[00:28:31.685 --> 00:28:34.629]  They have a lot of paper, and we can repudiate that paper.
[00:28:34.649 --> 00:28:36.572]  Most of it was generated unconstitutionally anyway.
[00:28:36.953 --> 00:28:39.637]  I think we can definitely win this because, A,
[00:28:41.272 --> 00:28:48.957]  We are the majority, and B, we have direct control, I hope still, over our state legislative process.
[00:28:49.078 --> 00:28:50.899]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, we've got a break.
[00:28:50.939 --> 00:28:51.920]  Long segment coming up.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.782]  Let's continue breaking this down on the other side.
[00:28:54.802 --> 00:28:59.905]  Then I'm going to get into Pentagon, brainwashing, and movies and TV for the young people, and a lot more.
[00:28:59.965 --> 00:29:00.486]  Stay with us.
[00:29:04.949 --> 00:29:05.849]  We're on the march.
[00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.851]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:08.861 --> 00:29:11.531]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:14.927 --> 00:29:18.190]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:22.453]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:29:22.613 --> 00:29:34.062]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:29:34.282 --> 00:29:39.906]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:29:39.906 --> 00:29:40.186]  I think so.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:09.524]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:30:09.544 --> 00:30:13.026]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:30:13.046 --> 00:30:19.350]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:23.032]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:30:23.052 --> 00:30:24.653]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:30:24.753 --> 00:30:27.555]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:30:27.575 --> 00:30:31.758]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:30:40.914 --> 00:30:45.781]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.641]  How dare you?
[00:30:50.821 --> 00:30:57.066]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:30:57.086 --> 00:30:59.888]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:30:59.988 --> 00:31:06.413]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:31:11.557 --> 00:31:14.079]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:18.383]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:31:18.993 --> 00:31:21.500]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:31:22.062 --> 00:31:26.254]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:31:27.003 --> 00:31:28.744]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:31:29.104 --> 00:31:32.125]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.

[00:32:12.148 --> 00:32:13.850]  OrganicaSeed.com today!
[00:32:21.363 --> 00:32:23.126]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:25.571]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:32:26.272 --> 00:32:33.085]  We're going to be going back to Dr. Edward Vieira, constitutional law scholar and attorney, here in just a moment.
[00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:41.161]  Before we go back to him, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors, very important sponsors that I believe in that make this radio show possible.
[00:32:41.221 --> 00:32:44.102]  One of them is SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:46.182]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:32:46.202 --> 00:32:52.584]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[00:32:52.944 --> 00:32:58.326]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims for example, when seeds had the highest value of any bartered item, even silver or gold.
[00:32:58.687 --> 00:33:04.829]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:10.892]  Governments are storing seeds, the UN is storing seeds, globalists of every stripe are storing seeds in the Arctic Circle and seed banks.
[00:33:11.212 --> 00:33:12.173]  Why do you think this is?
[00:33:12.813 --> 00:33:13.293]  You know why.
[00:33:13.373 --> 00:33:13.894]  Control.
[00:33:14.274 --> 00:33:19.938]  Solutions from Science is trying to get the seeds out of the globalist hands and into the hands of the people, one seed bank at a time, one family at a time.
[00:33:20.458 --> 00:33:28.183]  At Survival Seed Bank from Solutions from Science contains enough open pollinated seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden and then save your seeds.
[00:33:28.483 --> 00:33:31.085]  Survivalseedbank.com or give them a call 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[00:33:31.105 --> 00:33:32.486]  And from the same excellent sponsor,
[00:33:43.135 --> 00:33:44.056]  Uh, solutions from science.
[00:33:44.096 --> 00:33:46.697]  We also have mysolarbackup.com.
[00:33:47.158 --> 00:33:51.641]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power in this great system, the solar power generator system.
[00:33:52.061 --> 00:33:56.304]  This is designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[00:33:56.564 --> 00:34:03.089]  You get the emergency power backup kit, which consists of the power source, 1,800, power plant, and high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:08.713]  And again, the website is mysolarbackup.com, mysolarbackup.com, or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, mysolarbackup.com, great system.
[00:34:08.733 --> 00:34:11.255]  Okay, going back to Dr. Edwin Vieira, let's continue with the states.
[00:34:22.824 --> 00:34:32.029]  For those that don't know, maybe you should talk about the history, how the states created a compact to create the federal government, their right to abolish it, or remove it, or amend it.
[00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:39.533]  Instead, we have the feds openly training local police, openly setting all the standards, openly taking over, and the feds themselves
[00:34:40.393 --> 00:34:47.136]  As if, you know, the federal government wasn't bad enough, are now openly controlled by foreign banks, openly signing away Congress's authority.
[00:34:47.416 --> 00:34:58.541]  The President, under the Presidential Decision Directive 51 and others, is saying the Congress is ceremonial, Congress isn't allowed in the highest security clearances to see, you know, the full plans.
[00:34:58.801 --> 00:35:00.482]  Can you speak to that, Dr. Edwin Vieira?
[00:35:01.182 --> 00:35:03.223]  Well, of course, it's a constitutional impossibility.
[00:35:04.363 --> 00:35:05.924]  You know, you run down this list of things.
[00:35:06.497 --> 00:35:10.758]  And one checks off only one box next to them, unconstitutional, unconstitutional, unconstitutional.
[00:35:11.178 --> 00:35:12.499]  So what's the real problem here?
[00:35:12.559 --> 00:35:19.481]  It's the practical one, that the constitutional checks and balances in the system are not being put into operation.
[00:35:19.501 --> 00:35:21.461]  It's not that they're not functional, of course they're functional.
[00:35:21.801 --> 00:35:23.282]  It's that they're not being put into operation.
[00:35:23.522 --> 00:35:31.544]  They're not being put into operation at the judicial level, because we watched the Supreme Court look the other way with this question of Mr. Obama's eligibility
[00:35:31.544 --> 00:35:32.024]  We're good to go.
[00:35:57.229 --> 00:35:58.190]  Do we see the states?
[00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.251]  Well, now we're beginning to see the states.
[00:36:00.531 --> 00:36:06.974]  We're beginning to see this process of check and balances work, actually from the way it should always have worked, from the bottom up.
[00:36:07.534 --> 00:36:18.319]  And the final layer, the foundational structure, as I love to keep telling people, we're told this over and over again in the Constitution, a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state.
[00:36:18.339 --> 00:36:25.642]  The only thing the Constitution says is necessary for any purpose whatsoever, and necessary for the ultimate purpose.
[00:36:26.082 --> 00:36:27.342]  But it depends upon what?
[00:36:27.382 --> 00:36:29.843]  It depends upon actual participation by people.
[00:36:30.103 --> 00:36:32.924]  It's not a spectator sport to live in a free society.
[00:36:32.944 --> 00:36:37.186]  It requires self-government, and therefore it requires some kind of commitment and activity.
[00:36:37.486 --> 00:36:39.066]  And that's what we haven't seen in the past.
[00:36:39.366 --> 00:36:41.127]  We're beginning to see people wake up to that.
[00:36:41.747 --> 00:36:50.670]  Obviously, these state legislatures, the legislators who are passing the 10th Amendment, or state sovereignty resolutions, are taking a stand on this.
[00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.450]  And it's wonderful from an educational point of view.
[00:36:52.871 --> 00:36:54.231]  But, as I said earlier in the show,
[00:36:54.835 --> 00:36:57.758]  We need to begin thinking about the implementation of those.
[00:36:58.419 --> 00:37:04.686]  The reassertion of actual state power and legal authority as an effective check and balance.
[00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:06.849]  Not simply a rhetorical check and balance.
[00:37:07.449 --> 00:37:08.471]  We're at that stage now.
[00:37:08.711 --> 00:37:09.892]  The rhetoric is coming out.
[00:37:10.293 --> 00:37:10.893]  That's excellent.
[00:37:11.214 --> 00:37:13.056]  The next step is the practice.
[00:37:15.606 --> 00:37:26.945]  Absolutely, and the good news is when you look at the state resolutions in Alabama, in New Hampshire, in Colorado, they've now passed it in Oklahoma through the House.
[00:37:28.464 --> 00:37:29.725]  And many other states are passing it.
[00:37:30.025 --> 00:37:32.986]  They're saying, look, the federal government isn't protecting the borders.
[00:37:33.166 --> 00:37:34.927]  We will, because you're not doing your responsibility.
[00:37:35.608 --> 00:37:37.709]  We're doing this under Tenth Amendment rights and Ninth Amendment.
[00:37:38.169 --> 00:37:39.870]  Look, we know you're building FEMA camps.
[00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.991]  I mean, it's in the bills.
[00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:41.731]  I have them right here.
[00:37:42.071 --> 00:37:50.796]  A new one, House Bill 225, that under martial law, HB 225 Alabama, you will not be allowed to wantonly cease firearms in case of declared state of emergency.
[00:37:51.996 --> 00:37:53.097]  On and on and on.
[00:37:53.117 --> 00:38:00.662]  And they cite in these bills the PDDs, the executive orders, the federal bills, the camps.
[00:38:00.802 --> 00:38:03.624]  I mean, this is showing a high level of education.
[00:38:03.944 --> 00:38:05.065]  And I've talked to these state reps.
[00:38:05.085 --> 00:38:07.406]  We've probably interviewed more than 20 of them in the last few weeks.
[00:38:07.827 --> 00:38:08.927]  We've got more coming on this week.
[00:38:09.248 --> 00:38:11.049]  The understanding is exploding.
[00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:12.410]  I mean, they know as much as I do.
[00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:26.239]  I don't know that you know as much as you do, you study this so closely, but they are highly informed, and they tell me that the knowledge of this is spreading like wildfire through government, not just state government, but the sub-parts, the counties, the cities, the police.
[00:38:26.299 --> 00:38:28.741]  So that is very, very exciting.
[00:38:29.081 --> 00:38:42.650]  So speak to that, and then I'd like you to talk about not just the state level, but the county, the power of the juries, the grand juries, the power of the sheriffs, the power of the committees of safety that you've been spearheading.
[00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:51.732]  Well, if we go back to that first educational point, the thing that interests me about this is that it does not seem to be a sectional phenomenon.
[00:38:52.233 --> 00:39:00.335]  This isn't something coming up only in, say, Alabama or Mississippi, or only coming up in some of those far western Rocky Mountain states.
[00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:03.376]  It's essentially all over the country.
[00:39:04.116 --> 00:39:10.578]  And that's, from my perspective at least, a very good sign that we really have a national
[00:39:12.865 --> 00:39:14.146]  I don't know.
[00:39:24.784 --> 00:39:26.525]  Can be brought into play, obviously.
[00:39:27.125 --> 00:39:38.009]  If you go to the jury system, informed individuals on a jury are going to take very seriously their responsibilities, and we may see that certain unjust laws don't get themselves enforced.
[00:39:38.369 --> 00:39:42.291]  Not because the juries essentially nullify them, but because they simply don't convict these people.
[00:39:42.671 --> 00:39:48.833]  They don't find the reasonable doubt necessary, beyond a reasonable doubt necessary, to convict people under some of these statutes.
[00:39:49.293 --> 00:39:51.855]  And under those circumstances, there's absolutely nothing that can be done.
[00:39:52.135 --> 00:39:54.517]  The statutes simply find themselves to be unenforceable.
[00:39:54.557 --> 00:40:08.946]  On the other side, grand juries, at least in those states where the grand juries are not entirely controlled by prosecutors or prosecuting attorneys and state court judges, we may see some of the more horrendous oppression.
[00:40:09.887 --> 00:40:12.969]  Uh, being challenged and indictments being issued.
[00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:22.796]  I have a feeling that that may be one of the last steps, actually, because the first thing that has to be brought under control is what you were suggesting with the use of sheriffs, for instance.
[00:40:23.877 --> 00:40:27.800]  I am not so inclined to think that the sheriffs are enough.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:34.925]  I think it's very good that they are waking up to their responsibilities and very good that they are waking up to the excessive intrusion
[00:40:35.795 --> 00:40:39.958]  At the state and local level that we're seeing from the so-called federal law enforcement agencies.
[00:40:41.058 --> 00:40:52.986]  But until we have the ultimate backup there, until we have the organization of very large numbers of people in state militias, I don't think the sheriffs are going to prove to be sufficient to deal with this problem.
[00:40:53.326 --> 00:40:54.627]  I think that's the key, ultimately.
[00:40:54.667 --> 00:40:57.449]  It's organization of the people themselves.
[00:40:57.669 --> 00:41:04.273]  We've allowed the other side to tell us how we're going to be organized in their phony political parties.
[00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:06.631]  And they're phony special interest groups.
[00:41:06.991 --> 00:41:17.795]  And then otherwise to divide and conquer us, so that we haven't been able to put together our unity really in the level of force that it could exercise.
[00:41:18.636 --> 00:41:31.341]  And ultimately the one way to do that, with constitutional authority, this is a clear element in it, constitutional authority from the national level all the way down to the local level, because remember the militia of the several states are elements of the
[00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:37.655]  Federal Constitution, not simply within the states and the localities, is to revitalize those organizations.
[00:41:38.315 --> 00:41:45.141]  And organize, we're talking about tens of millions of people here, not a few thousand, a hundred thousand, but literally tens of millions of people.
[00:41:45.701 --> 00:41:56.170]  And if that kind of organization won't be sufficient to back up the sheriffs, to back up the local and state officials, to back up the grand juries, well then what would be?
[00:41:57.051 --> 00:42:00.354]  Well, Dr. Edwin Vieira, constitutional law scholar and attorney,
[00:42:01.784 --> 00:42:08.109]  The Feds know, and I want to get your response to this, I know you're aware of this, but I want to, for the audience, break this down.
[00:42:08.129 --> 00:42:14.254]  For those that may not be fully aware of this key element, they know the states have the right to abolish the criminal federal government.
[00:42:14.514 --> 00:42:19.398]  They know the states have the right, through grand juries and other mechanisms and state legislative investigations,
[00:42:20.258 --> 00:42:27.580]  To go after criminals in government and these foreign bankers that have usurped the federal power and are now usurping the state power.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:34.401]  So we're forced to carry out this operation against them or they're going to fully destroy the republic itself.
[00:42:34.481 --> 00:42:38.142]  Some spin this as if we're trying to get rid of the republic by secession.
[00:42:38.402 --> 00:42:40.302]  No, we're having the states re-declare their powers.
[00:42:41.043 --> 00:42:42.503]  But when you study this,
[00:42:43.243 --> 00:42:47.044]  You know, the Feds are coming in under emergency management and saying, we tell the local police what to do.
[00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:57.767]  You know, they're clearly usurping the system, and the establishment knows their bureaucracy, their police, their Feds aren't even enough.
[00:42:58.147 --> 00:43:06.589]  That's why we've seen for decades the Feds setting this up, but now under Obama they're actually launching the full operation for a million man, a civilian corps.
[00:43:06.649 --> 00:43:09.890]  The Pentagon's now signed the order to start the civilian corps.
[00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:34.187]  To co-opt the preachers, the pastors, the community, and give them little federal signets, even secret operations like InfraGard, 25,000 plus executives in government and in corporations being given secret, this is mainstream news, license to kill orders and firearms, so we have a covert
[00:43:34.927 --> 00:43:51.663]  True espionage operation by the globalists through the feds going on, and that shows they know the policies they're bringing in are going to foment revolt and proper right to revolt under what I'd call, you know, the Article 10 in New Hampshire right to revolt, you know, one of the strongest out there.
[00:43:51.683 --> 00:43:54.265]  So can you speak to what I just laid out there?
[00:43:54.285 --> 00:43:56.927]  This is a real war going on in our communities.
[00:44:00.346 --> 00:44:06.448]  One of them is that within the general government itself, we actually have two categories of individuals.
[00:44:06.508 --> 00:44:13.909]  We have what I would call the loyal public servants, who are actually trying to live within the spirit, at least, of the Constitution.
[00:44:13.929 --> 00:44:18.370]  It's difficult to live within the letter, given the extent of unconstitutional activity by that entity.
[00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:21.551]  And then we have what I like to call the rogue public officials.
[00:44:21.991 --> 00:44:29.433]  These are the ones who either don't care or intentionally are violating the Constitution for some individual gain, usually careerism of one kind or another.
[00:44:30.789 --> 00:44:34.570]  Those people are really acting in at least a quasi-criminal capacity.
[00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.611]  So I think, number one, they are not uniform at that level.
[00:44:39.191 --> 00:44:42.592]  They are not in a, we're in a unitary conspiracy against us.
[00:44:42.652 --> 00:44:46.112]  We have allies there, as well as at the state and local level.
[00:44:46.713 --> 00:44:51.234]  But on the other side of that coin, they obviously have a long-term game plan.
[00:44:51.614 --> 00:44:57.795]  I love this thing that Obama has pointed up, this idea that they need a huge
[00:44:58.653 --> 00:45:04.004]  A civilian national security force at least as large and well equipped as the armed forces and so forth and so on.
[00:45:04.305 --> 00:45:05.528]  That is exactly my point!
[00:45:06.491 --> 00:45:08.833]  That is precisely what we need.
[00:45:09.093 --> 00:45:13.616]  And the Constitution tells us where we're supposed to find that organization.
[00:45:13.716 --> 00:45:17.579]  But this is a federal... He has made my point, and I agree with him 100%.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.422]  If we had that organization, we would solve a great deal of the problems in this country.
[00:45:22.442 --> 00:45:28.226]  But he's creating a federal doppelganger of the militia that serves the central state.
[00:45:29.327 --> 00:45:30.348]  That's right, that's right.
[00:45:30.508 --> 00:45:33.190]  But you see, he's admitted the principle
[00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:34.790]  He's admitted the principle.
[00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:36.551]  Now we say, thank you very much, Barack.
[00:45:36.931 --> 00:45:41.092]  Let's go over here to this page on the Constitution, and we see how to implement this.
[00:45:41.552 --> 00:45:44.152]  In a sense, he's being hoisted with his own petard.
[00:45:44.532 --> 00:45:50.333]  Because from a propagandistic point of view, it's going to be very difficult for him to say, well, I don't want this organization if you people control it.
[00:45:50.553 --> 00:45:51.994]  Then that wakes everybody up.
[00:45:52.274 --> 00:45:54.734]  Oh, you want the organization if you control it.
[00:45:54.954 --> 00:45:59.815]  We're going to have some kind of Hitler Youth here, or some kind of Red Guards, or Komsomol.
[00:46:00.055 --> 00:46:01.236]  That's what you want to set up.
[00:46:01.356 --> 00:46:01.656]  Aha!
[00:46:01.896 --> 00:46:03.176]  Now we go to the next level.
[00:46:03.696 --> 00:46:04.757]  Of public awareness.
[00:46:05.578 --> 00:46:06.779]  Of what we're really dealing with.
[00:46:06.819 --> 00:46:08.961]  It's no longer listening to Alex Jones say this.
[00:46:09.221 --> 00:46:12.003]  It's listening to Barack Obama tell us that he wants it this way.
[00:46:13.504 --> 00:46:17.248]  I think it's extraordinarily dangerous the position he's put himself in from his point of view.
[00:46:17.628 --> 00:46:18.789]  Because he's made my point.
[00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:20.210]  He's made the Constitutional point.
[00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:26.295]  The situation has become so dire in this country that we have to go to essentially that last line of defense.
[00:46:26.555 --> 00:46:29.558]  And the Constitution tells us who's supposed to be in that last line of defense.
[00:46:29.818 --> 00:46:30.639]  It's us, not him.
[00:46:31.059 --> 00:46:33.581]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, here's my issue.
[00:46:33.721 --> 00:46:42.469]  We can say that there's the good guys in government and the rogues, and we know it's the good men and women who have held this back and slowed it down, but now total tyranny is arriving.
[00:46:43.049 --> 00:46:45.391]  And we saw this in Germany and Russia and many other places.
[00:46:45.651 --> 00:46:49.014]  The rogues have gotten in all the major power positions at the highest levels.
[00:46:49.314 --> 00:46:57.181]  They're bringing in their personnel, expanding their cadres, and I think it's fair to say this is a completely rogue government.
[00:46:58.502 --> 00:47:00.603]  At every major operational level.
[00:47:00.623 --> 00:47:02.103]  The directives are rogue.
[00:47:02.343 --> 00:47:11.886]  There may be people that sluggishly implement it throughout the machinery, but I think we need to declare this as the Founding Fathers did, as Patrick Henry did, as a completely bankrupt, rogue government.
[00:47:12.706 --> 00:47:21.049]  Well, except for the fact that the major element in the government, which the Constitution tells us is the one necessary, we haven't yet implemented it.
[00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:26.050]  We're the ones who are this ultimate power in the government.
[00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:27.891]  And for a hundred and some fifty years,
[00:47:29.098 --> 00:47:39.443]  The people in control in Washington and to a large extent the state governments have let the militia acrify to the point that they are... I won't... Your phone was cutting out there, Doctor.
[00:47:43.465 --> 00:47:44.445]  We may have lost him.
[00:47:45.786 --> 00:47:47.527]  Folks, they've usurped the militia and
[00:47:50.538 --> 00:47:51.379]  That's what they do.
[00:47:51.459 --> 00:47:59.705]  When the police walk over to you and say, don't videotape us when you're standing a hundred yards away, or when they come up and say, you can't videotape the Golden Gate Bridge, but everybody else can.
[00:47:59.725 --> 00:48:01.646]  They can surveil you and Google Maps has it right there.
[00:48:02.006 --> 00:48:03.527]  They are exercising power.
[00:48:04.148 --> 00:48:09.051]  Just like we don't exercise our power to be sovereigns and stand up and have liberty, we've been cowed.
[00:48:09.091 --> 00:48:10.012]  We've been intimidated.
[00:48:10.392 --> 00:48:12.774]  We've been trained and taught to stand down.
[00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:16.891]  And they've trained us to be slaves.
[00:48:17.392 --> 00:48:18.793]  They've trained us like you train a dog.
[00:48:19.093 --> 00:48:21.115]  To follow orders and do what we're told.
[00:48:22.416 --> 00:48:35.726]  And so we have to have this awakening to how bankrupt they are and how what they've set up is a counterfeit of our country and they're now even removing the final even ceremonial vestiges of freedom here.
[00:48:36.407 --> 00:48:37.608]  These are illegitimate criminals.
[00:48:38.068 --> 00:48:38.288]  Sir,
[00:48:39.949 --> 00:48:41.150]  Yeah, your phone broke up there.
[00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:42.351]  Please continue with your point.
[00:48:42.831 --> 00:48:43.372]  Back now, Alex.
[00:48:43.552 --> 00:48:44.453]  Well, no, I agree with you.
[00:48:44.473 --> 00:48:51.378]  All I'm saying is we can't allow that to deflect us from our own course.
[00:48:51.818 --> 00:48:56.222]  Yes, this is what they're doing, but what is the one way in the long run to defeat them?
[00:48:56.582 --> 00:49:03.228]  It's to organize ourselves on a sound constitutional basis with legal authority and the power at the local level.
[00:49:03.548 --> 00:49:07.411]  We can do that if we simply will ourselves to do it.
[00:49:08.542 --> 00:49:12.685]  I don't see how they can stop us short of imposing that ultimate police state tyranny.
[00:49:12.885 --> 00:49:16.388]  And then, obviously, at that stage when they attempt to do that, all bets are off.
[00:49:16.608 --> 00:49:24.574]  We're in the Declaration of Independence situation, and, you know, it's a matter of as much as political power comes out of the barrel of a gun.
[00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:26.256]  We're not quite there yet.
[00:49:26.576 --> 00:49:34.362]  We still have the ability, if we're willing and smart enough, to take the steps necessary to bring ourselves back into that constitutional structure.
[00:49:35.143 --> 00:49:42.505]  Uh, and all I'm looking for is the next step in what we've seen in the Sovereignty Resolutions, the enforcement mechanism.
[00:49:42.885 --> 00:49:46.026]  Let's take those Sovereignty Resolutions to their logical conclusion.
[00:49:46.066 --> 00:49:46.466]  Stay there.
[00:49:46.526 --> 00:49:53.748]  Let's talk about those enforcement mechanisms and what you've really been pushing these, um, committees of security or, um...
[00:49:56.223 --> 00:49:58.887]  You know, committees of public order.
[00:49:59.568 --> 00:50:01.450]  How the people take back control of their government.
[00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.915]  And the other ace in the hole the enemy has, staged terror attacks.
[00:50:05.756 --> 00:50:09.101]  You know, when Oklahoma and others passed resolutions saying they weren't going under U.N.
[00:50:09.141 --> 00:50:12.045]  control, we know what happened in Oklahoma City and we know who did it.
[00:50:12.425 --> 00:50:12.846]  Stay with us.
[00:50:14.608 --> 00:50:17.629]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:21.369]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:50:21.849 --> 00:50:27.791]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:50:28.151 --> 00:50:32.292]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:50:32.792 --> 00:50:38.513]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:50:38.813 --> 00:50:41.873]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:50:42.214 --> 00:50:44.114]  Run sump pumps, short-wave radios,
[00:50:44.534 --> 00:50:44.914]  I think so.
[00:51:14.656 --> 00:51:21.039]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:21.399 --> 00:51:23.380]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:24.041 --> 00:51:25.081]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:25.602 --> 00:51:26.102]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:26.402 --> 00:51:27.302]  This is his ammo.
[00:51:27.342 --> 00:51:28.743]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:28.783 --> 00:51:30.424]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:30.764 --> 00:51:37.508]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:37.908 --> 00:51:38.348]  Some U.S.
[00:51:38.388 --> 00:51:44.031]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:51:44.731 --> 00:51:48.213]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:51:48.233 --> 00:51:50.394]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:14.628 --> 00:52:17.930]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:20.532]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?

[00:53:19.517 --> 00:53:22.719]  Final segment with Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[00:53:27.941 --> 00:53:44.369]  Doctor, be sure and follow your website and some of your great books and for folks to get involved with you and the Committees of Safety modeled after what happened in the decade before the Revolutionary War, how people communicated and set up their own true government outside of the British regional unelected governors.
[00:53:47.028 --> 00:53:48.548]  This is an organizational fight.
[00:53:49.268 --> 00:53:52.189]  In summation, how do folks support you?
[00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:52.909]  How do they get involved?
[00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:58.250]  How do they take your great constitutional ideas and put them into action in the field?
[00:53:59.851 --> 00:54:02.531]  Well, first they can go to newswithviews.com.
[00:54:02.551 --> 00:54:08.212]  There's a large archive there of articles I have written on these subjects over the past several years.
[00:54:09.233 --> 00:54:15.194]  Then, number two, they can go to committeesofsafety.com or committeesofsafety.org.
[00:54:16.642 --> 00:54:28.051]  And you'll see what some people, at least, are doing to attempt to revitalize malicious structures and other forms of local organization to deal with these problems in a strictly constitutional fashion.
[00:54:28.772 --> 00:54:35.277]  And you can find some links there to my books and some DVDs that have been put out, which will be useful.
[00:54:35.337 --> 00:54:38.119]  These people tell me that they've been proven to be very useful.
[00:54:38.559 --> 00:54:42.002]  And of course, at this stage, we need education in the second step.
[00:54:42.546 --> 00:54:48.691]  That first step, the education has succeeded, obviously, and we're seeing more states passing these sovereignty resolutions.
[00:54:49.151 --> 00:54:53.375]  The second step now is to expand that education into the implementation stage.
[00:54:54.005 --> 00:55:06.127]  And ultimately, that implementation has to be done by local organizing, and then through local organizing, bringing grassroots pressure to bear on the state legislatures, and passing the next stage statutes.
[00:55:06.567 --> 00:55:08.668]  Some of these are monetary reform statutes.
[00:55:09.728 --> 00:55:10.728]  Indiana has one.
[00:55:10.788 --> 00:55:11.688]  Missouri has one.
[00:55:11.748 --> 00:55:13.388]  Colorado has one.
[00:55:13.688 --> 00:55:16.549]  Montana, the one that's going in there, there's one in Georgia.
[00:55:16.869 --> 00:55:21.970]  They're cropping up all over the country as a result, I think, of a statute I wrote in New Hampshire several years ago.
[00:55:22.944 --> 00:55:23.325]  I don't think so.
[00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:45.372]  That these other issues of local organization and the revitalization of the militia will go on to the front burner as well.
[00:55:45.932 --> 00:55:51.033]  And at that stage, we really begin to take back the country from the local and state level.
[00:55:51.513 --> 00:55:55.694]  Because it's through local and state organization that we're going to do it.
[00:55:55.994 --> 00:55:58.615]  Doctor, but the globalists, as you know, aren't going to sit on their hands.
[00:55:59.135 --> 00:56:01.415]  And they are going to stage crises, stage wars.
[00:56:02.156 --> 00:56:03.996]  They're very bold, that's why they're in power.
[00:56:04.016 --> 00:56:05.416]  They take action, the people don't.
[00:56:05.736 --> 00:56:07.317]  At least in modern times.
[00:56:08.573 --> 00:56:12.914]  What do we do about the Feds, the illegitimate Feds, staging events, staging crises?
[00:56:13.794 --> 00:56:16.075]  I mean, openly saying Barack Obama may be like Lincoln.
[00:56:16.095 --> 00:56:18.736]  They're openly saying they may come in and swat down states.
[00:56:19.116 --> 00:56:25.398]  I mean, their entire battle build up, and under the John Ward Defense Authorization Act, they say governors will be federal, dual-hatted.
[00:56:25.418 --> 00:56:26.638]  I mean, this is all happening.
[00:56:27.298 --> 00:56:29.139]  Well, the governors, let's start with the governors.
[00:56:29.159 --> 00:56:30.579]  The governors simply have to refuse that.
[00:56:30.879 --> 00:56:34.300]  If we're talking about people that have been educated in terms of state sovereignty,
[00:56:34.978 --> 00:56:40.801]  I'm the true position of the states and the Constitution, they have to refuse to go along with unconstitutional directives no matter where they come from.
[00:56:41.521 --> 00:56:48.304]  And ultimately if they're talking about, if you're talking about a scenario in which it's, the goal is for some of these rogue politicians to actually suppress
[00:56:49.611 --> 00:56:56.916]  A large segment of this country, then the only solution to that is for those large segments of the country to organize themselves beforehand.
[00:56:57.237 --> 00:57:00.479]  I mean, self-government requires self-reliance, ultimately self-protection.
[00:57:00.619 --> 00:57:01.760]  Yes, well that's what we're doing.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:07.144]  We're here mobilizing and letting folks know the playbook of the globalists that have now hijacked the nation.
[00:57:07.184 --> 00:57:09.485]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, I want to thank you for spending all this time with us.
[00:57:09.806 --> 00:57:10.526]  Thank you.
[00:57:10.786 --> 00:57:13.989]  Did you get any response last time you were on to folks wanting to send their own?
[00:57:14.189 --> 00:57:15.510]  Yes, I certainly did.
[00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:18.372]  Your people are well in touch with what's going on.
[00:57:18.888 --> 00:57:23.610]  Okay, well give us the websites so folks can also get involved in your committees of safety.
[00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:34.013]  Okay, the first website for educational purposes, newswithviews.com, and then for activism, committeesofsafety.com.
[00:57:34.453 --> 00:57:38.274]  Alright, I want to talk to you again in the next few months as all this develops and unfolds.
[00:57:38.614 --> 00:57:41.675]  We thank you for your tireless defense of the Republic.
[00:57:41.795 --> 00:57:42.856]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, take care.
[00:57:42.876 --> 00:57:43.296]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:57:44.289 --> 00:57:47.072]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back with the next hour.
[00:57:47.092 --> 00:57:50.877]  We've got a state senator joining us, trying to declare sovereignty right here in Texas.
[00:57:51.177 --> 00:57:54.441]  Don't forget our websites, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:57:56.063 --> 00:57:57.885]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:57:59.587 --> 00:58:01.870]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:04.445 --> 00:58:06.006]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:06.126 --> 00:58:10.768]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:10.868 --> 00:58:13.629]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:16.870]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:21.592]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:22.733]  If you simply prepare.
[00:58:22.953 --> 00:58:25.895]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:58:26.195 --> 00:58:33.081]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:58:33.201 --> 00:58:36.323]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:58:36.463 --> 00:58:38.144]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[00:58:41.607 --> 00:58:47.693]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:58:47.873 --> 00:58:51.616]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:58:51.636 --> 00:58:52.977]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:58:52.997 --> 00:58:53.578]  Take action today.
[00:58:53.618 --> 00:58:55.440]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:07.228 --> 00:59:09.130]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:12.393]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:25.171 --> 00:59:27.752]  Well, we're already into the fourth and final hour.
[00:59:27.772 --> 00:59:30.412]  We've got about 59 and a half minutes laying out before us.
[00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:34.434]  We have a state senator saying if the feds won't protect the border, the state will.
[00:59:35.054 --> 00:59:37.114]  His only problem is Rick Perry's going to try to block him.
[00:59:37.154 --> 00:59:37.675]  You watch.
[00:59:38.255 --> 00:59:41.876]  He loves to paint himself as a patriot, a conservative, but that's not the case.
[00:59:42.256 --> 00:59:44.276]  Mexico on the verge of collapsing.
[00:59:44.296 --> 00:59:45.857]  That's the State Department.
[00:59:46.892 --> 00:59:58.202]  The yuppies have no idea they're still traveling down there to be shut down by the Mexican police, even the resort towns now, as that nation fully collapses via corruption, just like the United States is starting to collapse from corruption.
[00:59:59.183 --> 01:00:04.267]  I mentioned this yesterday and a little bit earlier, but I want to spend some time on this later, too, after the state senator leaves us.
[01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:07.430]  Texas unknowingly donate children's blood to research.
[01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:13.175]  Medical privacy advocates, ethicists say parents should be asked for consent before newborn screening samples are kept.
[01:00:13.195 --> 01:00:13.335]  Yeah.
[01:00:13.996 --> 01:00:16.758]  You know, I've refused this, and when they come in, they go, it's the law.
[01:00:16.798 --> 01:00:19.299]  The health department has to test for your baby having diseases.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.301]  And I go, nurse, I'm not ignorant.
[01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:29.025]  I happen to know that goes to the health department, and it's put in an international DNA database, and you claim you own my children's DNA and patent it.
[01:00:29.065 --> 01:00:32.808]  I've seen the federal court cases, and they go, and then they back off.
[01:00:34.187 --> 01:00:41.069]  One time I was so busy, I've had three children, I just was busy and just said, oh, sign this, and looked at it halfway and thought it was discharge papers.
[01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.909]  I did sign one.
[01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:44.350]  I mean, you know, because they just slip it in on you.
[01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:48.031]  It was like a sleep on the couch and then they come in, sleep in the chair.
[01:00:49.272 --> 01:00:50.632]  This is the criminality of government.
[01:00:50.672 --> 01:00:51.592]  This is what it does.
[01:00:51.632 --> 01:00:52.513]  This is how it operates.
[01:00:52.553 --> 01:00:56.014]  And people's denial, I would talk about this for years.
[01:00:56.974 --> 01:01:00.915]  For year, after year, after year, after year.
[01:01:01.495 --> 01:01:03.136]  If you're 30, almost 36, it started
[01:01:05.122 --> 01:01:13.407]  In 1973, worldwide, wherever the IMF and World Bank control things, because they control our governments, this was done, a global DNA database.
[01:01:14.107 --> 01:01:15.768]  And they can use this to frame you, you name it.
[01:01:15.788 --> 01:01:19.010]  So I want to read some of the story before the show ends.
[01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:20.211]  It was also in UPI.
[01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:23.553]  But it's only about Texas, because we've been exposing it here.
[01:01:23.853 --> 01:01:24.853]  This is all over the world.
[01:01:24.893 --> 01:01:28.936]  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, England, Canada.
[01:01:29.996 --> 01:01:30.997]  This is everywhere.
[01:01:31.097 --> 01:01:32.198]  This is criminal.
[01:01:33.211 --> 01:01:36.474]  And so we'll break down this whitewash and go over a little bit of that.
[01:01:38.436 --> 01:01:43.001]  I've also got some other important stories I want to cover dealing with, they want to tax forest fires.
[01:01:43.021 --> 01:01:48.386]  They want to tax you nationally if there's forest fires, because forest fires put off carbon dioxide and that's toxic waste.
[01:01:48.406 --> 01:01:50.408]  I mean, they're just going to tax everything.
[01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:54.412]  So we'll be going over that report for you as well today.
[01:01:54.973 --> 01:01:57.135]  Before I end this segment,
[01:01:58.783 --> 01:02:01.543]  Let's go ahead and pull up the ObamaDeception.net website.
[01:02:01.604 --> 01:02:02.684]  Can we pipe in that audio?
[01:02:02.704 --> 01:02:11.885]  I want to show people the site and who are watching at PrisonPlanet.tv and encourage you to go to ObamaDeception.net or TheObamaDeception.net.
[01:02:11.945 --> 01:02:12.685]  Both will get you there.
[01:02:13.186 --> 01:02:18.186]  And watch the trailer, read the data page, research about this, and then get involved.
[01:02:19.367 --> 01:02:21.707]  I want you to get the Obama Deception on DVD.
[01:02:21.727 --> 01:02:22.567]  I want you to order it.
[01:02:22.607 --> 01:02:23.607]  It ships March 15th.
[01:02:23.627 --> 01:02:24.047]  Pre-order it.
[01:02:24.067 --> 01:02:25.168]  You'll be the first to get it in the mail.
[01:02:25.568 --> 01:02:26.848]  That's only two and a half weeks away now.
[01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:33.689]  Please get The Obama Deception at Infowars.com or TheObamaDeception.net or call toll free to get it.
[01:02:34.009 --> 01:02:35.150]  Get your pre-order in now.
[01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:38.730]  We also have these great t-shirts that have half of Bush's face saying, Worst President Ever.
[01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:41.631]  The other half's Obama and it says, Until Now.
[01:02:42.111 --> 01:02:47.772]  That shatters the left-right paradigm, sparks conversations with Obamanoids and Bushoids.
[01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:49.073]  You can explain it.
[01:02:49.373 --> 01:02:50.993]  Don't you understand they give you false choices?
[01:02:51.493 --> 01:02:54.094]  They show you both of these people.
[01:02:55.797 --> 01:03:01.662]  And then they lay him out, and then you think you have a choice, like going on a used car lot, and he says, here's the two cars you can buy.
[01:03:02.002 --> 01:03:03.143]  These are the two choices you've got.
[01:03:03.183 --> 01:03:05.605]  What about expanding those choices?
[01:03:06.145 --> 01:03:10.869]  The Obama deception doesn't get into, was he born in Kenya, or is he a commie, or whatever.
[01:03:10.889 --> 01:03:18.474]  It gets into the fact that he lied about everything he said he'd do, his globalist agenda is evil, gun confiscation, FEMA camps, everything Bush was setting up.
[01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:35.103]  On steroids, continuing with Barack Obama, because the public blames everything on Bush, they remove the puppet, put the new puppet in, takes four to eight years for people to wake up to that he's a puppet, and they put in a new puppet, and we never look at the power behind the throne, we never look at the establishment, we never look at who's setting these globalist policies.
[01:03:35.544 --> 01:03:38.525]  We have the same policies here that are in England, that are in Australia, that are in Germany.
[01:03:38.785 --> 01:03:41.006]  It's the same social engineers.
[01:03:41.046 --> 01:03:47.570]  This is a program, a control plan, they're on record about it, all we've got to do is tell the truth about this, and the new order's going to fail.
[01:03:48.766 --> 01:03:57.369]  TheObamadeception.net, ladies and gentlemen, or InfoWars.com, or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:03:57.389 --> 01:03:59.010]  888-253-3139.
[01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:04.312]  We'll be right back after this quick break for more news and information.
[01:04:04.332 --> 01:04:07.893]  We've got a state senator coming up as the states rebel against the New World Order.
[01:04:14.716 --> 01:04:17.317]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:20.903]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:04:21.263 --> 01:04:24.685]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:04:25.045 --> 01:04:31.249]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:04:31.629 --> 01:04:36.673]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[01:04:36.853 --> 01:04:43.557]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[01:04:43.877 --> 01:04:44.758]  Need something more?
[01:04:44.958 --> 01:04:48.603]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[01:04:48.903 --> 01:04:56.972]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.

[01:05:03.479 --> 01:05:07.503]  That's MRDefense.com or call 1-800-313-6400.
[01:05:07.783 --> 01:05:13.928]  That's 1-800-313-6400 for all of your self-defense needs today.
[01:05:14.768 --> 01:05:21.173]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:21.533 --> 01:05:23.195]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:05:24.167 --> 01:05:25.188]  But who is the enemy?
[01:05:25.709 --> 01:05:26.209]  Bin Laden.
[01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:27.491]  This is his M.O.
[01:05:27.511 --> 01:05:28.833]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:05:28.873 --> 01:05:30.474]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:37.623]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:05:38.023 --> 01:05:38.464]  Some U.S.
[01:05:38.504 --> 01:05:44.171]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:05:44.831 --> 01:05:48.372]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:05:48.712 --> 01:05:58.595]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:05:58.815 --> 01:05:59.555]  Fabled enemies.

[01:07:15.021 --> 01:07:20.626]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:26.191]  Coming up, I'm gonna play two different pieces of Pentagon propaganda.
[01:07:27.532 --> 01:07:28.273]  One, the new G.I.
[01:07:28.313 --> 01:07:30.755]  Joe movie trailer, The Rise of Cobra.
[01:07:31.615 --> 01:07:33.257]  Cobra!
[01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:40.103]  And then, I'm gonna play a Kid Rock propaganda video.
[01:07:41.926 --> 01:07:51.310]  The Pentagon is talking about $40 plus billion worldwide, upwards of $10 billion of that domestically, to pay for music videos, movies.
[01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:53.951]  It's called propaganda placement.
[01:07:54.231 --> 01:07:55.311]  They call it product placement.
[01:07:55.331 --> 01:07:56.632]  I call it propaganda placement.
[01:07:57.572 --> 01:07:58.832]  And it's going on everywhere.
[01:07:59.213 --> 01:08:02.434]  So we'll be playing those videos live at PrisonPlanet.tv and analyzing them.
[01:08:02.454 --> 01:08:07.856]  Of course, the radio listeners will hear the audio as well, and I'll stop and comment on it.
[01:08:08.956 --> 01:08:09.916]  We'll get into some other news.
[01:08:09.936 --> 01:08:19.459]  We have State Senator Dan Patrick, one of the most powerful state senators, saying that they're going to put state forces on the border because Mexico's collapsing and the feds won't stop it.
[01:08:20.099 --> 01:08:20.719]  That's the plan.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:27.161]  It's in the Security Prosperity Partnership documents to basically let the border collapse and collapse Mexico to overrun the U.S.
[01:08:27.241 --> 01:08:35.504]  Then say a North American Union security perimeter contiguous on the North American continent no longer borders in Mexico and Canada
[01:08:36.638 --> 01:08:42.481]  With the U.S., but contiguous from Guatemala, border with Mexico, all the way up to Alaska.
[01:08:43.482 --> 01:08:45.503]  This is all on record, and they're going to do it through crises.
[01:08:45.523 --> 01:08:53.027]  They create crises, banking crises, military crises, terror crises, refugee crises, and then offer their solution.
[01:08:53.347 --> 01:08:56.148]  I told you three years ago they were racing to pass amnesty.
[01:08:56.729 --> 01:09:03.792]  I'm on record because Mexico was going to collapse, and they wanted to go ahead and have the amnesty plan set up beforehand.
[01:09:03.832 --> 01:09:04.833]  Now it's going to be harder for them.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:08.762]  But for the next ten minutes, I always love having him up once a month.
[01:09:09.923 --> 01:09:14.745]  And that's Marty Schachter of CalbinPureSoap.com or FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:09:14.966 --> 01:09:17.447]  The reason I have him on is it really is a public service announcement.
[01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:20.329]  He's not just a great sponsor for now about four or five years.
[01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:26.673]  Marty has been in the organic soap business, California Certified Organic, before they even had that.
[01:09:27.413 --> 01:09:28.854]  I mean, he's the standard of it.
[01:09:28.934 --> 01:09:30.155]  Only sold to institutions.
[01:09:31.553 --> 01:09:33.834]  And then we found out about the soap, it was so great.
[01:09:34.214 --> 01:09:37.236]  And usually organic soap costs two or three times what the toxic detergents do.
[01:09:37.636 --> 01:09:39.977]  His is 85% off what the toxic detergents are.
[01:09:40.237 --> 01:09:41.818]  Forget the huge premium for organic.
[01:09:42.238 --> 01:09:43.799]  And these are the best organics out there.
[01:09:43.819 --> 01:09:45.559]  A lot of organics are too strong or burn you.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.441]  He was in chemical weapons in World War II.
[01:09:49.541 --> 01:09:51.842]  Started Calvin's Soap when he got back with his dad.
[01:09:51.902 --> 01:09:54.924]  Now he runs it with his son and family in Oakland, California.
[01:09:56.366 --> 01:10:06.669]  And this is Factory Direct, but the reason he's here is last time I had him on, we didn't have time to get into what is in the stuff you're using at the store versus what organic soap is.
[01:10:07.129 --> 01:10:08.530]  Marty, it's great to have you here with us.
[01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.850]  Hello, Alex.
[01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:13.211]  You have reached the Department of Homeland Cleanliness.
[01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:17.532]  Your satisfaction is guaranteed, or double your dirt back.
[01:10:18.393 --> 01:10:25.855]  Let us at Calvin bail you out with our stimulus packages of one through five years of soap
[01:10:26.411 --> 01:10:29.772]  At a cost of $0.40 to $0.20 a day.
[01:10:30.312 --> 01:10:34.093]  No more $20 to $30 deficits a week.
[01:10:34.594 --> 01:10:36.974]  No junk science detergent chemicals.
[01:10:37.294 --> 01:10:39.595]  No more getting ripped off for cleanliness.
[01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:46.537]  No more deteriorating clothing, burning skin, itching scalp, outsourced products.
[01:10:47.157 --> 01:10:47.798]  No more.
[01:10:48.598 --> 01:10:51.999]  This is our goal, this is our philosophy, and we share it.
[01:10:54.457 --> 01:10:55.797]  Marty, let's start at the beginning.
[01:10:56.358 --> 01:10:59.018]  Why did you start Calvin and Yourself in 1947?
[01:11:00.519 --> 01:11:08.701]  Well, when I got out of the Army in 1947, after serving two years in Japan, my father left civil service.
[01:11:08.741 --> 01:11:10.061]  He was getting too old for that.
[01:11:10.421 --> 01:11:19.084]  They let him go, and we discovered, coincidentally, going to a supermarket shopping, that soap doesn't exist anymore.
[01:11:19.504 --> 01:11:20.224]  Like, does.
[01:11:20.324 --> 01:11:21.144]  Like, ivory.
[01:11:21.524 --> 01:11:22.725]  Like, feldmapta.
[01:11:22.985 --> 01:11:23.745]  Like, viking.
[01:11:24.289 --> 01:11:25.549]  It was all detergents.
[01:11:25.609 --> 01:11:27.870]  Well, I learned in the Army what detergents were.
[01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:29.150]  They were a poison.
[01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:31.071]  They were made for poison gases.
[01:11:31.611 --> 01:11:37.613]  And we said, you know, that'd be a unique situation if we could start a small business selling real soap.
[01:11:38.473 --> 01:11:46.256]  Well, the only way we could do that was going to commercial enterprises, the hotels, motels, rest homes, convalescent hospitals.
[01:11:46.596 --> 01:11:48.396]  We couldn't get on the shelf anyway.
[01:11:48.436 --> 01:11:49.076]  No way.
[01:11:49.497 --> 01:11:53.998]  Procter & Gamble, Lever, and Colgate, they dominated the marketplace.
[01:11:54.674 --> 01:12:04.201]  Uh, with billions of dollars worth of advertising and hypnotism and, uh, all the ways of brainwashing the consumer to get these toxic detergents.
[01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:07.243]  And, uh, we just started a little small company.
[01:12:07.943 --> 01:12:16.849]  My father and I started calling our hospitals and schools, and we were accepted because our products were virtually twice as good and half the price.
[01:12:17.369 --> 01:12:22.593]  So we built up our business institutionally, and then about four years ago, I got a call
[01:12:23.106 --> 01:12:25.127]  From Genesis Communication Network.
[01:12:25.947 --> 01:12:26.868]  What was his name?
[01:12:27.208 --> 01:12:27.828]  No, it was Michael Drudeau.
[01:12:27.868 --> 01:12:29.249]  It was actually about seven years ago.
[01:12:29.309 --> 01:12:29.869]  Time flies.
[01:12:29.889 --> 01:12:32.010]  But, Marty, let's stop right there.
[01:12:33.231 --> 01:12:38.233]  The reason toxic waste costs a lot more is because of all the advertising.
[01:12:38.653 --> 01:12:42.295]  Big Oil had all this toxic waste from the refining of oil process.
[01:12:42.315 --> 01:12:43.455]  I know you were in the chemical course.
[01:12:43.495 --> 01:12:44.776]  You know this, but the audience doesn't.
[01:12:45.276 --> 01:12:48.097]  They have all these byproducts, like sodium fluoride.
[01:12:48.117 --> 01:12:48.738]  They put it in the water.
[01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:53.772]  That's like China admits they dump their toxic waste in our food and ship it to us.
[01:12:54.553 --> 01:12:55.873]  It's how they get rid of toxic waste.
[01:12:55.933 --> 01:12:57.654]  It's like lawn fertilizer.
[01:12:57.694 --> 01:13:02.597]  It says don't use this on vegetable or on farms because it's full of mercury, lead, arsenic.
[01:13:02.657 --> 01:13:03.377]  It runs off.
[01:13:03.818 --> 01:13:04.978]  That's how it's done.
[01:13:06.419 --> 01:13:16.605]  You discovered all that and put this out and we're not kidding when we tell people what is in the so-called soap that's really detergents that people
[01:13:20.316 --> 01:13:41.150]  Well, most of the detergents are made from waste petroleum, high alkalinity chemicals, and another ingredient that they add in large amounts is sodium chloride.
[01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.231]  And people think that's a new cleaner.
[01:13:43.311 --> 01:13:45.753]  Sodium chloride is table salt.
[01:13:46.243 --> 01:13:51.984]  Would you wash your face, your body, your baby, your home with table salt?
[01:13:52.865 --> 01:13:54.305]  No, we don't believe in that.
[01:13:54.385 --> 01:14:10.869]  We make our products from vegetable oils, coconut oils, we use juices from cherries, from almonds, instead of perfumes which are toxic, and it's been very successful by the thousands and thousands of
[01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:37.166]  Alex Jones listeners that are buying our products now repeatedly and it's been a real beneficial to know that we can share products that we've developed and since 1947 when we started 62 years ago and our slogan developed is our business is going down the drain and we we're very proud of that that people buy our products that they're safe that they do the job
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:43.463]  And they're far, far superior than anything offered in the supermarket right now.
[01:14:43.863 --> 01:14:51.787]  And it's a pleasure to have and to be endorsed by Alex and share our knowledge and our philosophy.
[01:14:52.027 --> 01:14:53.588]  Well, Marty, you're a sweetheart.
[01:14:53.628 --> 01:14:55.689]  I mean, it's just a great product and a great price.
[01:14:56.269 --> 01:14:59.471]  Factory Direct, 62 years, family business.
[01:15:00.592 --> 01:15:04.133]  I guess Bob Dylan would say someday growing your own garden will be against the law.
[01:15:04.153 --> 01:15:06.895]  I'm surprised they haven't banned you even being able to make
[01:15:07.415 --> 01:15:08.235]  You know, real soap.
[01:15:08.275 --> 01:15:12.857]  How dare someone do this and not let us rip everybody off with toxic waste.
[01:15:12.917 --> 01:15:16.998]  I mean, it's such a sick fraud how people pay to be screwed.
[01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:19.519]  How they pay to have a bad deal.
[01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:20.840]  We have to become educated.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.240]  We have to become informed and say no.
[01:15:23.161 --> 01:15:33.204]  Let's give out the toll-free number for folks that want to call and get one of the sampler tote bags, or for somebody that wants to get a free catalog, or go ahead and order a month's supply, a year's supply of soap.
[01:15:33.704 --> 01:15:34.905]  Break that down for folks, Marnie.
[01:15:35.743 --> 01:15:36.423]  1-800-340-7091.
[01:15:37.204 --> 01:15:44.887]  Or look us up on the web, 5starsoap.com.
[01:15:45.527 --> 01:15:47.688]  5 the letter or 5 the number, it makes no difference.
[01:15:48.068 --> 01:15:49.688]  5starsoap.com.
[01:15:49.968 --> 01:15:51.209]  Get a free catalog.
[01:15:51.509 --> 01:15:59.432]  It's a beautiful, detailed information educating you to upgrade your lives from the chemicals that you're getting now.
[01:15:59.932 --> 01:16:01.953]  We have samples, we have
[01:16:02.796 --> 01:16:08.220]  Packages going from one year to five year at the lowest impossible cost.
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:09.401]  You won't believe it.
[01:16:09.441 --> 01:16:11.122]  You think this is too good to be true.
[01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:13.444]  It's true and it's good.
[01:16:13.844 --> 01:16:19.549]  And we can verify that with all the Alex Jones families that are enjoying our products.
[01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:20.750]  Absolutely.
[01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:21.830]  5 Star Soap.
[01:16:21.871 --> 01:16:23.212]  Either the letter or spell it out.
[01:16:23.872 --> 01:16:24.653]  5starsoap.com.
[01:16:24.753 --> 01:16:26.654]  Give them that number again, Marty.
[01:16:26.674 --> 01:16:26.714]  800-340-7091.
[01:16:31.903 --> 01:16:32.243]  1-800-340-7091.
[01:16:36.624 --> 01:16:38.645]  My whole family is waiting for your call.
[01:16:38.665 --> 01:16:46.728]  It would be our pleasure to service you, take care of you, save you money, and take you out of coaching and put you into first class.
[01:16:47.168 --> 01:16:53.930]  Well, anything to help folks get a good deal and also shock it to the chemical companies that have taken over every facet of life.
[01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:56.611]  Give me a limerick in closing there.
[01:16:56.631 --> 01:16:57.851]  We always enjoy those, Marty.
[01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:00.032]  Okay, well this is in
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.901]  Uh, we're doing it with apologies to Irving Berlin.
[01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:10.343]  Blue Cross had me agree to a new Blue Cross policy.
[01:17:10.363 --> 01:17:17.185]  Uh, Blue Cross said I would be thrilled that Blue Cross covered me.
[01:17:17.205 --> 01:17:19.985]  Then I took a fall, leg in a splint.
[01:17:20.385 --> 01:17:22.706]  They said I should read all the fine print.
[01:17:23.146 --> 01:17:27.707]  When a high fever I ran, they said I took out the wrong plan.
[01:17:28.128 --> 01:17:29.468]  Oh, Blue Cross.
[01:17:29.915 --> 01:17:35.500]  There seems to be plenty for Blue Cross and none for me.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:41.085]  Thank you, all you Blue Cross members.
[01:17:41.546 --> 01:17:43.988]  Thank you very, very, very much.
[01:17:44.028 --> 01:17:44.508]  All right.
[01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:47.151]  Marty Schachter, we'll talk to you again next month.
[01:17:47.191 --> 01:17:47.751]  God bless you.
[01:17:48.131 --> 01:17:48.912]  I look forward to it.
[01:17:48.952 --> 01:17:49.613]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:17:50.554 --> 01:17:51.314]  Take care, my friend.
[01:17:51.354 --> 01:17:52.575]  That really is a great guy.
[01:17:52.595 --> 01:17:53.636]  And 62 years doing that.
[01:17:56.673 --> 01:18:00.437]  Just look at how we pay for all these services and then they just give us toxic waste.
[01:18:00.978 --> 01:18:06.624]  Because they'd have to pay to store the sodium fluoride and what's left over when they crack the oil when they refine it.
[01:18:07.445 --> 01:18:09.867]  Just Google the oil refining process.
[01:18:09.907 --> 01:18:13.491]  You can find all these university diagrams from, you know,
[01:18:14.352 --> 01:18:24.078]  Petroleum engineers and science classes, and it'll show you the hundreds of things they make out of oil, out of crude oil, but then there's all these other distillates that are toxic waste.
[01:18:24.278 --> 01:18:25.719]  That is what goes in the soap.
[01:18:25.739 --> 01:18:26.779]  This is not soap.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.041]  It's like the Federal Reserve isn't federal.
[01:18:29.081 --> 01:18:30.582]  The Patriot Act isn't a Patriot Act.
[01:18:30.862 --> 01:18:33.023]  When they pull troops out of a country, they call it a build-down.
[01:18:33.603 --> 01:18:36.165]  Everything is a semantical lie with these crooks.
[01:18:37.286 --> 01:18:39.467]  And so we love Marty, he's a great guy.
[01:18:40.488 --> 01:18:41.408]  FiveStarsSoap.com.
[01:18:41.488 --> 01:18:42.669]  Okay, when we come back,
[01:18:44.144 --> 01:18:46.785]  I've got to hurry here, because I've got this state senator coming up.
[01:18:47.166 --> 01:18:59.152]  I want to play this Cobra, the Rise of Cobra video, and just illustrate how you're going to be a superhuman guy if you join the military.
[01:18:59.492 --> 01:19:01.674]  All the symbolism is the Army's white star.
[01:19:01.914 --> 01:19:03.735]  It's a special forces group in the Army.
[01:19:04.335 --> 01:19:06.156]  Join this, kids, and you'll be superhuman.
[01:19:06.456 --> 01:19:12.319]  The truth is, you'll get used up in foreign wars and injected with eugenics vaccines and be treated like crap and ripped off.
[01:19:12.679 --> 01:19:13.100]  Stay with us.
[01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:17.325]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:19:17.485 --> 01:19:22.729]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:19:22.989 --> 01:19:28.353]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:19:28.713 --> 01:19:29.834]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:19:30.194 --> 01:19:39.121]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:39.481]  Yes!
[01:19:39.501 --> 01:19:41.143]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:45.528]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:50.193]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:19:50.574 --> 01:19:52.256]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:19:54.318 --> 01:19:57.820]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[01:20:22.193 --> 01:20:23.213]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:20:23.453 --> 01:20:29.856]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:20:30.476 --> 01:20:38.999]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:20:39.383 --> 01:20:46.185]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:20:46.485 --> 01:20:49.526]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:20:49.646 --> 01:20:54.827]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:20:55.407 --> 01:20:58.048]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:20:58.488 --> 01:21:05.230]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:21:08.285 --> 01:21:09.430]  This is the government sponsored terror.
[01:21:09.872 --> 01:21:12.364]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:21:13.766 --> 01:21:14.746]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:14.826 --> 01:21:19.608]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:21:19.768 --> 01:21:27.571]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:21:27.831 --> 01:21:33.193]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:21:33.413 --> 01:21:40.395]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:46.018]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:21:46.278 --> 01:21:51.021]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:21:51.361 --> 01:21:58.965]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:21:59.305 --> 01:22:05.549]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:22:05.869 --> 01:22:06.990]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:09.707 --> 01:22:09.990]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:13.055 --> 01:22:17.636]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[01:22:17.977 --> 01:22:25.159]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:26.799]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[01:22:27.019 --> 01:22:30.920]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:34.762]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[01:22:35.002 --> 01:22:39.123]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[01:22:39.483 --> 01:22:42.824]  Phase One is a One World Currency which we are currently being prepared
[01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:43.044]  We're good.
[01:23:17.102 --> 01:23:21.789]  Alright folks, we're going to go right into this video of military propaganda.
[01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:26.397]  Tens of billions of dollars domestically, pushing the image that you need to join the military.
[01:23:26.417 --> 01:23:27.579]  It's the thing to do to be a hero.
[01:23:27.599 --> 01:23:28.881]  Well, it isn't our military anymore.
[01:23:28.901 --> 01:23:31.585]  It's being used for this empire and bankrupting us.
[01:23:32.446 --> 01:23:39.690]  And then coming up, we're going to get into some of the things that are happening in Mexico, as well, with a state senator.
[01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:44.312]  But right now, let's go ahead and play, I mean, it's like every movie now, it's just amazing.
[01:23:44.953 --> 01:23:53.097]  Transformers, you name it, and they admittedly are getting Pentagon resources, they approve the script, this is to get young people to envision themselves.
[01:23:53.337 --> 01:23:59.000]  Think of Cobra Commander, he lives in a cave, he's a terrorist, he's an international financier, he can never be stopped, sounds like Bin Laden.
[01:24:00.501 --> 01:24:04.990]  I mean, Cover Commander 20 years ago was wearing the black ski mask and the uniform that our SWAT teams wear now.
[01:24:05.311 --> 01:24:12.044]  Little kids watch this and it's predictive programming, is what they call it, to then accept this later in life.
[01:24:13.038 --> 01:24:20.585]  And, you know, the imagery, the white star of the army, you know, calling in the secret unit, these bionic suits they've got, they're superhuman.
[01:24:21.126 --> 01:24:25.490]  This is all glorifying joining the military when this is not our military anymore.
[01:24:25.770 --> 01:24:28.773]  So let's go ahead and play this quick trailer from G.I.
[01:24:28.853 --> 01:24:31.235]  Joe, The Rise of Cobra!
[01:24:34.998 --> 01:24:37.280]  When I'm finished, the world will never forget.
[01:24:43.816 --> 01:24:45.318]  Technically, we don't exist.
[01:24:46.319 --> 01:24:47.380]  We answer to no one.
[01:24:49.061 --> 01:24:52.564]  And when all else fails, we don't.
[01:24:52.825 --> 01:24:54.226]  What did you say your unit was called?
[01:24:55.727 --> 01:24:56.068]  I didn't.
[01:24:59.891 --> 01:25:00.352]  G.I.
[01:25:00.412 --> 01:25:02.153]  Joe The Rise of Cobra.
[01:25:02.714 --> 01:25:03.795]  Coming out this summer.
[01:25:05.563 --> 01:25:07.584]  And you'll just be superhuman in these bionic suits.
[01:25:07.604 --> 01:25:11.866]  And then there's Three Doors Down and, you know, Kid Rock and all these videos.
[01:25:12.787 --> 01:25:16.289]  And people have made spoofs of them, showing them before movies.
[01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:20.251]  They're just everywhere, selling people on this image.
[01:25:20.631 --> 01:25:27.295]  And they're hiring aggravated felons, illegal aliens, illegal alien aggravated felons, mercenaries to make up the military.
[01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:28.195]  It's really nightmarish.
[01:25:28.675 --> 01:25:29.736]  This isn't our military anymore.
[01:25:29.776 --> 01:25:32.217]  Just like in Germany, the military wasn't the German people's anymore.
[01:25:32.558 --> 01:25:34.779]  It was under Adolf Hitler's power.
[01:25:35.848 --> 01:25:40.076]  Let's go ahead now and go to the little Kid Rock Warrior piece.
[01:25:40.817 --> 01:25:41.558]  Here it is, folks.
[01:25:44.163 --> 01:25:46.587]  And then we've got a state senator coming up.
[01:25:55.939 --> 01:25:57.259]  Yeah, he's a race car driver.
[01:25:57.299 --> 01:25:58.160]  He's a citizen.
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:25:59.640]  He's in the military.
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:01.660]  Just everything cool, man.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.241]  NASCAR, rock and roll.
[01:26:03.461 --> 01:26:04.321]  Yeah!
[01:26:04.481 --> 01:26:07.522]  He's gonna fight Al-Qaeda!
[01:26:07.882 --> 01:26:11.183]  Yeah, baby!
[01:26:12.523 --> 01:26:12.643]  Ah!
[01:26:12.723 --> 01:26:15.924]  Inject me with the small epoxy and crack shot.
[01:26:16.204 --> 01:26:18.825]  When I shrivel up, put me in a coffin too.
[01:26:20.972 --> 01:26:26.557]  When I get out of the military, you'll cut my funding and rip me off.
[01:26:26.697 --> 01:26:34.323]  When you blow up the chemical dump, Camusia, and my brain stem rots and I become paralyzed.
[01:26:34.643 --> 01:26:42.509]  You'll tell me to take Prozac, NASCAR, partyin', rock and roll, have some fun, let's just go!
[01:26:42.529 --> 01:26:43.190]  Oh yeah!
[01:26:43.210 --> 01:26:45.171]  Oh I'm so tough!
[01:26:45.371 --> 01:26:46.612]  Oh I'm Kid Rock!
[01:26:47.013 --> 01:26:47.753]  Oh I'm so high!
[01:26:47.793 --> 01:26:48.794]  Oh yeah!
[01:26:50.035 --> 01:26:52.258]  Come on, sucka, idiot kids!
[01:26:52.518 --> 01:26:54.220]  Join the military!
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:56.303]  Redepleting uranium!
[01:26:56.483 --> 01:26:59.346]  It's just like playing video games!
[01:26:59.567 --> 01:27:02.210]  You'll be able to slaughter them for real!
[01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:08.077]  And when we're done with you... When you do the devil's side, high in the air!
[01:27:08.578 --> 01:27:10.760]  We got a soft kill weapon for you!
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:19.731]  Cause we know, after you're done killing for us, you're gonna wake up when we screw you, and you're not gonna like it!
[01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:24.276]  So we're gonna inject you with the cancer viruses, yeah!
[01:27:25.751 --> 01:27:29.916]  Yeah, 1,300,000 dead Iraqis!
[01:27:30.516 --> 01:27:33.480]  But we'll sell you the image that we're helping them!
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.402]  It's so much fun!
[01:27:35.682 --> 01:27:37.184]  It's so good!
[01:27:37.464 --> 01:27:38.845]  Yeah, New World Order!
[01:27:38.926 --> 01:27:39.326]  Yeah!
[01:27:41.638 --> 01:27:47.583]  Meanwhile, we're also training to confiscate your guns door-to-door.
[01:27:48.284 --> 01:27:48.724]  Yeah!
[01:27:58.562 --> 01:28:02.263]  You wanna have fun and be a race car driver?
[01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:06.044]  Then just sign up for the military!
[01:28:06.924 --> 01:28:08.705]  Everybody will love you!
[01:28:08.725 --> 01:28:10.345]  You like little kids, don't ya?
[01:28:10.365 --> 01:28:11.626]  Then join the military!
[01:28:11.646 --> 01:28:12.546]  Yeah!
[01:28:13.166 --> 01:28:13.826]  Yeah!
[01:28:14.146 --> 01:28:16.487]  Download this song free.
[01:28:16.707 --> 01:28:18.908]  Go to Yahoo and search National Guard Warrior.
[01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:23.929]  Absolutely, and your tax money paid for that propaganda.
[01:28:23.969 --> 01:28:25.849]  It's everywhere to suck your children in.
[01:28:26.710 --> 01:28:27.190]  Meanwhile...
[01:28:28.743 --> 01:28:31.445]  CNN right here, just blew my voice out.
[01:28:32.606 --> 01:28:38.570]  Money to put kids in prison with set-ups with the judges getting kickbacks to put your children in prison.
[01:28:40.011 --> 01:28:44.095]  That's what's really going on with this criminal government that wants to destroy all the liberties we've got.
[01:28:45.214 --> 01:28:46.055]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:46.095 --> 01:28:53.422]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network simulcasting with the InfoWars Radio Network and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:28:53.442 --> 01:28:54.022]  You found it.
[01:28:54.242 --> 01:28:55.123]  The tip of the spear.
[01:28:55.483 --> 01:28:58.987]  In the InfoWar, we will defeat tyranny!
[01:28:59.047 --> 01:29:02.089]  We swear eternal resistance to tyranny!
[01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:03.491]  Stay with us!
[01:29:04.752 --> 01:29:05.653]  We're on the march.
[01:29:06.153 --> 01:29:07.754]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:08.675 --> 01:29:11.378]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:14.767 --> 01:29:16.268]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:29:16.448 --> 01:29:17.910]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:29:18.190 --> 01:29:20.432]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:29:20.872 --> 01:29:25.616]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:29:26.016 --> 01:29:28.859]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:29:29.199 --> 01:29:32.702]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:29:33.112 --> 01:29:45.099]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:29:45.659 --> 01:29:47.641]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:29:47.661 --> 01:29:48.961]  I use one every day.
[01:29:49.382 --> 01:29:51.843]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:29:52.083 --> 01:29:52.644]  We're good.
[01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:21.113]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:21.493 --> 01:30:23.474]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:30:24.134 --> 01:30:25.154]  But who is the enemy?
[01:30:25.674 --> 01:30:26.195]  Bin Laden.
[01:30:26.475 --> 01:30:27.415]  This is his ammo.
[01:30:27.435 --> 01:30:28.816]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:30:28.836 --> 01:30:30.536]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:30:30.837 --> 01:30:37.579]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:30:37.979 --> 01:30:38.420]  Some U.S.
[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:44.122]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:30:44.802 --> 01:30:48.284]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:30:48.304 --> 01:30:50.465]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:31:14.611 --> 01:31:17.352]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[01:31:17.552 --> 01:31:18.652]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[01:31:18.672 --> 01:31:22.853]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[01:31:22.873 --> 01:31:27.435]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function, or are you simply treating the symptoms?
[01:31:27.675 --> 01:31:37.898]  The SinuPlus Elite Advanced Sinus Irrigation System effectively cleanses your sinuses and upper airways of all fungi, bacteria, and pathogens, and clears your sinuses gently and pleasantly.
[01:31:37.978 --> 01:31:38.298]  We're good.
[01:32:08.018 --> 01:32:08.459]  I'm good.
[01:32:30.552 --> 01:32:31.853]  We are back live.
[01:32:32.373 --> 01:32:42.157]  Upwards of 30 states have now introduced resolutions saying no to gun confiscation, no to martial law, no to Obama's forced compulsory service, no to all of it.
[01:32:42.917 --> 01:32:44.878]  We've been having state reps and state senators on.
[01:32:44.898 --> 01:32:48.659]  We've got Ron Paul lining up next week to talk about it as well.
[01:32:48.759 --> 01:32:49.540]  Very exciting.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:33:03.324]  We had a state rep on last week from Texas who's introduced 10th Amendment, 9th Amendment resolutions, re-declaring Texas sovereignty, but State Senator Dan Patrick, very influential Senator, big history in talk radio, also a best-selling author.
[01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:13.187]  You can go to Patrick.Senate.State.Texas.US or just Google State Senator, Texas State Senator Dan Patrick and find his page and books and all the stuff he's done.
[01:33:13.667 --> 01:33:25.316]  But he's moving to say if the Feds won't protect the border, if it's now collapsing, Mexico in collapse, narco-terrorism, police being killed on both sides, thousands dead, that he's got a plan to actually secure that border.
[01:33:25.336 --> 01:33:29.799]  I remember two years ago, Perry went down there and did some staged events with Homeland Security.
[01:33:30.439 --> 01:33:32.120]  State Senator, it's good to have you here with us.
[01:33:32.781 --> 01:33:40.947]  Hey, Alex, great to be on, and I'm on Facebook, so the easiest place to find me is Dan Patrick on Facebook, and we've got thousands of friends out there, so that's great.
[01:33:40.987 --> 01:33:42.488]  Great to be on with you, appreciate everything.
[01:33:42.884 --> 01:33:44.105]  You do out there for the cause.
[01:33:44.485 --> 01:34:09.486]  More than ever, Alex, more than ever, we need to be sure we talk about, you know, the history that this nation was founded upon, the Judeo-Christian ethic, the freedoms, because we are rapidly losing them, I mean, day by day, at the hands of the Obama administration, and quite frankly, you know, I blame it on a lot of my own party for allowing this to happen, and so the next time that
[01:34:10.524 --> 01:34:12.145]  We are back in charge in Washington.
[01:34:12.185 --> 01:34:13.146]  Of course, I serve in Austin.
[01:34:14.207 --> 01:34:20.892]  We're going to have to be sure we have the real deal, the real people, not people in name only, who campaign on things they don't believe on.
[01:34:21.533 --> 01:34:25.116]  It's time for real leaders and real believers, because time is running out.
[01:34:26.076 --> 01:34:36.124]  Tell us, for those around the country listening who don't know how really bad it is in Texas and across the entire contiguous border with Mexico and the Southwest, what is happening?
[01:34:36.305 --> 01:34:37.686]  CNN, Wall Street Journal,
[01:34:38.326 --> 01:34:41.707]  The Pentagon, Homeland Security say Mexico has a good chance of collapsing.
[01:34:41.747 --> 01:34:47.468]  El Paso Times, I want to know quietly the National Guard's beefing up down there, preparing to shut the border.
[01:34:47.488 --> 01:34:49.869]  100 million people down there during collapse.
[01:34:50.529 --> 01:34:53.310]  Can you break down with the intel, you've got really what we're facing?
[01:34:53.650 --> 01:35:04.533]  Sure, and let me tell you Alex, something, I was on Fox last week in the morning and also in the afternoon, one of their new shows, and talked about the fact that last Tuesday is the first time in modern history
[01:35:05.034 --> 01:35:11.398]  The Texas went on alert, and until I broke that story, really, in fact, very few people at the Capitol knew it.
[01:35:12.039 --> 01:35:24.647]  And we have a multiple stage, I won't go into too much detail because of homeland security, but we have a multiple stage alert process, and we triggered, or the governor triggered step one of that, to my knowledge.
[01:35:24.687 --> 01:35:26.608]  He may have triggered another step, but I think it was step one.
[01:35:28.209 --> 01:35:32.131]  And the reason was, Alex, we saw for the first time something we had not seen before.
[01:35:32.191 --> 01:35:34.513]  We have 19 border crossings with Mexico and Texas.
[01:35:35.234 --> 01:35:40.777]  And a couple of the key bridges, you saw those people forming on the other side, blocking the bridges.
[01:35:41.298 --> 01:35:47.121]  Well, we didn't know if that crowd of 50 would turn into 500, turn into 5,000, turn into 50,000.
[01:35:47.161 --> 01:35:48.922]  Was this the beginning of the revolution?
[01:35:49.442 --> 01:35:50.943]  Was this the beginning of the takeover?
[01:35:51.384 --> 01:35:52.944]  And if so, we needed to be ready.
[01:35:53.024 --> 01:35:55.346]  So that first stage alert went out.
[01:35:56.614 --> 01:36:05.176]  The plan in Texas, Alex, and I've supported a number of issues for a number of years, even before I got into the legislature, but here's the breakdown.
[01:36:05.216 --> 01:36:06.796]  We have six sectors with Mexico.
[01:36:06.916 --> 01:36:12.838]  Of that 2,000-mile, 1,800-mile border with Mexico, two-thirds of it in Texas.
[01:36:13.318 --> 01:36:15.338]  And a lot of it is out there in no-man's land.
[01:36:15.358 --> 01:36:22.940]  You get down Del Rio and other places where it's easy to spot people coming across there because they have to come across the river, they have to go over some desert or some
[01:36:23.311 --> 01:36:27.352]  Pretty sparse area to get up to a freeway or a highway, rather, to get to a city.
[01:36:27.712 --> 01:36:29.212]  That's relatively easy to control.
[01:36:29.452 --> 01:36:31.773]  The key is your big points of entry.
[01:36:31.873 --> 01:36:33.673]  That's where all the illegals are coming in.
[01:36:33.994 --> 01:36:35.214]  That's where we need the fencing.
[01:36:35.294 --> 01:36:44.396]  That's where we need to beef up our border patrol, our Department of Public Safety state troopers, our National Guard.
[01:36:44.816 --> 01:36:45.916]  That's what we need to do.
[01:36:45.996 --> 01:36:51.878]  So it's not like we've got a mass troops or personnel along, you know, 1,200 miles, 1,400 miles of border.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:37:01.182]  We simply need to be sure, across from El Paso, Laredo, McAllen, Brownsville, and some other key points, so we can get this job done.
[01:37:01.622 --> 01:37:07.724]  And if there's a refugee problem, Alex, the refugees need to be in Northern Mexico, not Southern Texas.
[01:37:08.264 --> 01:37:10.284]  Because there's two possible scenarios that I see.
[01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:20.387]  One is the slow economic meltdown of Mexico, where you just have hundreds of thousands of people, I mean, beyond the normal immigration of illegals, coming here out of desperation.
[01:37:20.807 --> 01:37:21.467]  You know, just to eat.
[01:37:22.208 --> 01:37:22.609]  I don't know.
[01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:48.697]  On Wednesday, there was a grenade launcher and a bazooka used to take out eight government officials in Renosa, which is just south of McAllen.
[01:37:59.870 --> 01:38:03.712]  I mean, it used to be a thriving tourist place down there.
[01:38:03.772 --> 01:38:05.093]  I went down there when I was a kid with my parents.
[01:38:05.153 --> 01:38:14.018]  It's all shut down, boarded up now, and I mean, we've already been seeing the collapse of Mexico with these 30 million illegal aliens that have been flooding in the last decade.
[01:38:14.198 --> 01:38:16.540]  But you're talking about a fast collapse.
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:20.382]  How bad, from the people studying this, the experts you're talking to, could it get?
[01:38:21.222 --> 01:38:27.206]  Well, you know, I think what is very concerning to me is that
[01:38:28.106 --> 01:38:39.611]  You know, if you talked about this even two years ago, yes, we've seen a mass migration of illegal immigrants into the United States, you know, driven by economic factors, better jobs here, better life here.
[01:38:40.052 --> 01:38:51.917]  But we didn't see that because people in Mexico were running out of fear, or literally running because the economy had totally collapsed there.
[01:38:52.197 --> 01:38:57.420]  And so what has happened is, if you had said two years ago, could Mexico collapse, people would have laughed.
[01:38:58.230 --> 01:39:02.675]  And I'd like to think that it's not probable, but it's possible.
[01:39:02.875 --> 01:39:20.793]  And the fact that it's possible, Alex, that a country so large, and one of our major trading partners, one of our big oil partners, just a stone's throw across the Rio Grande, that they could collapse, is a major issue for this administration, who I don't think will probably know how to handle it.
[01:39:21.323 --> 01:39:22.224]  And for this country.
[01:39:22.284 --> 01:39:27.328]  So, obviously, you know, the question is, what happens if you have millions trying to get here?
[01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:33.372]  You have economic chaos in the United States, and we've got to be sure they are not allowed to come here.
[01:39:34.373 --> 01:39:38.716]  Well, we already have, you know, collapses, you know, along the border from California to here.
[01:39:38.736 --> 01:39:40.057]  That's already a civil war.
[01:39:40.758 --> 01:39:42.559]  Yeah, I mean, it's already a civil war.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.623]  And so, I mean, now you're trying to be conservative here and saying, you know, we hope this doesn't happen, and it probably won't happen.
[01:39:47.663 --> 01:39:49.765]  But, I mean, it already is happening.
[01:39:50.225 --> 01:40:01.752]  Well, I've talked to, interviewed all these Texas sheriffs going back five, six years ago, where if they grab a truckload of marijuana or cocaine, the Mexican troops come across the border, put guns in their heads and say, we're going to kill you if you don't give that to them.
[01:40:02.133 --> 01:40:07.796]  And then Homeland Security a year ago told the National Guard not to fire back when Mexican troops shoot at them.
[01:40:08.657 --> 01:40:10.478]  Yeah, I can't comment.
[01:40:10.778 --> 01:40:11.639]  And I've heard those stories.
[01:40:11.679 --> 01:40:14.881]  I've never been able to confirm them or verify them.
[01:40:15.001 --> 01:40:18.383]  And I'm pretty strong in that area.
[01:40:18.583 --> 01:40:19.524]  But I will say,
[01:40:19.864 --> 01:40:20.265]  Let's do it.
[01:40:35.785 --> 01:40:36.526]  Go to Mexico.
[01:40:36.666 --> 01:40:40.131]  Even the resort towns of Acapulco or Cancun or Cozumel.
[01:40:40.551 --> 01:40:41.913]  Do not let them go.
[01:40:50.725 --> 01:40:51.445]  Yeah, and that's the problem.
[01:40:51.485 --> 01:40:53.267]  You don't know where to turn to for justice.
[01:40:53.287 --> 01:40:57.769]  About a month ago, the person in the Calderon government who was in charge of the anti-kidnapping squad
[01:41:20.519 --> 01:41:27.742]  Uh, was arrested because he was taking bribes of $450,000 a month, and he was head of the anti-kidnapping charge.
[01:41:27.782 --> 01:41:38.706]  There was a scheduler who knew the whereabouts of Calderon, um, who supposedly was being paid $100,000 a month just to keep the whereabouts of the president known to some of the drug cartels.
[01:41:39.386 --> 01:41:45.388]  Um, this, I mean, this is an explosive situation that most likely will get worse before it gets better.
[01:41:45.468 --> 01:41:49.570]  Car bombs, I mean, a high-level assault on government.
[01:41:50.357 --> 01:42:03.048]  And I think that the big question that the Calderon government will have to resolve, and the Obama administration, will we send American troops into Mexico at some point to help the Mexican government?
[01:42:03.288 --> 01:42:04.709]  We've had to do it twice before.
[01:42:06.570 --> 01:42:15.838]  And so far the Mexican government has not wanted the troops, and obviously our troops are stretched thin, and you don't want to be in the middle of that type of war.
[01:42:16.417 --> 01:42:21.500]  But look, here's the good news, if there's good news out of here.
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:32.306]  The reason we've seen an escalation of violence and really civil war along the northern border is because when Vincente Fox was president, he did basically nothing in terms of drug law enforcement.
[01:42:32.606 --> 01:42:39.410]  When Calderon came in, he came in and he had his 45,000 soldiers spread across Mexico, taking on the drug cartels.
[01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:40.790]  So they're in a fight.
[01:42:40.811 --> 01:42:41.651]  I mean, it's a battle.
[01:42:42.151 --> 01:42:44.192]  And so the drug cartels are battling the government.
[01:42:44.352 --> 01:42:45.213]  He's battling back.
[01:42:45.766 --> 01:42:47.066]  And so that's a positive.
[01:42:47.367 --> 01:42:54.969]  But in that positive, it has created this great carnage and just terrible violence that's impacting our country as well.
[01:42:55.029 --> 01:43:00.570]  So the situation has to be watched closely by those of us in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California.
[01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:04.131]  Well, Senator Patrick, let me throw this in, though, in the six minutes we have left with your seven minutes.
[01:43:04.752 --> 01:43:06.232]  We don't have much time here.
[01:43:06.752 --> 01:43:11.994]  Specifically, though, you've been on TV talking about if the feds won't protect the border, the state needs to do it.
[01:43:12.034 --> 01:43:12.734]  Can you speak to that?
[01:43:13.368 --> 01:43:27.258]  Yeah, well, actually, when I ran for office, I'm serving my second session, and when I ran back in 2005, I made the point that, yes, it's the federal government's responsibility, that's what my opponents kept saying.
[01:43:27.678 --> 01:43:31.501]  I said, that is true, but it's Texas' problem, and we're going to have to solve it.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:39.522]  And I believe Governor Perry has the will, and I believe others of us have the will in Texas, that if the federal government does not react, we must react.
[01:43:39.602 --> 01:43:40.622]  Okay, what is that plan?
[01:43:40.662 --> 01:43:42.223]  I mean, do you put the state police in there?
[01:43:42.263 --> 01:43:43.463]  Do you do emergency funding?
[01:43:43.543 --> 01:43:49.184]  Well, as I mentioned before, it's a series of, it's a number of plans.
[01:43:49.224 --> 01:43:54.706]  Number one, you've got to send more aid to the county sheriffs who are on the, they're the frontline battle guys.
[01:43:55.785 --> 01:43:59.326]  You've got to work, and Border Patrol, and... What about a Texas fence?
[01:43:59.386 --> 01:44:00.527]  What about a Texas fence?
[01:44:00.807 --> 01:44:08.990]  Well, as I said a moment ago, it is a waste of resources to put a fence out in the middle of no man's land, because God has given us a natural fence called the Rio Grande.
[01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:10.271]  But what about in the key areas?
[01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:13.292]  But in the key areas, that's where we need it.
[01:44:13.352 --> 01:44:17.734]  Now, 90% of the land on the border is Texas land, so we have a lot of authority there.
[01:44:19.014 --> 01:44:23.756]  We have to, you know, there are some constitutional provisions that we have to be careful of, but at the end of the day,
[01:44:24.344 --> 01:44:28.846]  We have the Texas State Guard, several thousand strong, which could grow quickly.
[01:44:28.906 --> 01:44:30.947]  I think volunteers would step up very quickly.
[01:44:31.287 --> 01:44:33.628]  We have the National Guard that the Governor can call out.
[01:44:33.748 --> 01:44:35.769]  We have a large state police force.
[01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:41.031]  We have our game wardens, we have our DPS, and all working in concert with the Border Patrol.
[01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:42.512]  But you can't tie their hands!
[01:44:42.552 --> 01:44:45.613]  I believe if we made it a major priority
[01:44:47.458 --> 01:44:50.900]  To ratchet up our level of boots on the ground.
[01:44:51.221 --> 01:44:54.723]  Every time we put boots on the ground, we see illegal immigration go down dramatically.
[01:44:54.743 --> 01:45:00.707]  But Senator, from what you've said, we need to put them there now because it could collapse any day, any month, any year.
[01:45:01.007 --> 01:45:08.872]  We're already seeing a collapse, so are you moving now to go ahead and draw up the plan while it's in session, perfect timing, and get the forces down there we need?
[01:45:09.413 --> 01:45:15.497]  Well, the plan is to be drawn up by the Homeland Security Director and with the Governor's oversight.
[01:45:16.218 --> 01:45:17.280]  Thank you, sir.
[01:45:32.135 --> 01:45:35.260]  I mean relatively quickly in the worst-case scenario.
[01:45:35.621 --> 01:45:43.834]  So I am confident that in a worst-case scenario we'll be ready to meet that challenge.
[01:45:44.134 --> 01:45:46.458]  I'm also confident that we're taking the right steps we need now.
[01:45:47.037 --> 01:45:52.082]  Senator Patrick, the big issue here is we can't tie the hands of the police if they're down there being shot at.
[01:45:52.402 --> 01:45:55.425]  They need to open up on the... These are real terrorists.
[01:45:55.805 --> 01:45:59.008]  Not the little ones sneaking around underneath the desks that the government's taking all our liberties to fight.
[01:45:59.549 --> 01:46:00.670]  This is real terrorism.
[01:46:00.690 --> 01:46:03.252]  They're killing police citizens, kidnapping Americans.
[01:46:03.833 --> 01:46:06.475]  I mean, we need to move heavy assets down there.
[01:46:07.216 --> 01:46:08.657]  Mexico's attacked us repeatedly.
[01:46:08.697 --> 01:46:17.986]  They attacked us during World War I. I'm not saying the government's doing this now, but I'm sorry to say the people down there, and especially the leadership, they hate this country.
[01:46:18.526 --> 01:46:20.048]  I know you know about the plan of San Diego.
[01:46:20.108 --> 01:46:24.411]  The German tried to launch attacks and gave the orders in World War II.
[01:46:25.172 --> 01:46:31.398]  I mean, this is a country that hates our guts, and I'm saying if Mexico wants to start something, I'm talking about their drug gangs, we need to wipe them out.
[01:46:32.301 --> 01:46:41.087]  Well, I think the biggest concern that most of us here have, Democrats, Republicans alike, and I'm a conservative Reagan Republican, but I think it's across the aisle.
[01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:50.634]  All of us are concerned about the transnational gangs and the violence of these gangs ratcheting up in America to where it has in New Mexico.
[01:46:51.474 --> 01:46:52.515]  I mean, in Mexico.
[01:46:52.855 --> 01:46:55.657]  And also the violence just spilling over on the border.
[01:46:55.677 --> 01:47:00.841]  You know, a lot of the police officials, a lot of the executives, a lot of the government officials who actually
[01:47:01.434 --> 01:47:04.635]  Work in Mexico, live across the border in Texas.
[01:47:04.655 --> 01:47:07.276]  Sir, that's my final question.
[01:47:07.296 --> 01:47:08.017]  They're afraid they live here.
[01:47:08.237 --> 01:47:12.198]  That's what I'm saying here is that they target police, they target military.
[01:47:13.619 --> 01:47:15.019]  They say take money or we'll kill you.
[01:47:15.419 --> 01:47:18.701]  This is already spilling over into Texas and California.
[01:47:18.761 --> 01:47:21.302]  Well, we've already seen some of it, but we have not.
[01:47:21.542 --> 01:47:28.184]  For example, in Juarez and Ciudad Juarez, I mean, across from El Paso, there were 1,600 murders in Juarez.
[01:47:29.867 --> 01:47:33.769]  Which is, you know, right across the bridge from El Paso, there were 18 murders last year.
[01:47:33.809 --> 01:47:38.731]  So, so far, so far, we've been able to hold that level of violence on their side.
[01:47:38.751 --> 01:47:43.073]  I mean, 1,600 to 18, and those are real facts, real numbers, is significant.
[01:47:43.713 --> 01:47:47.495]  But when those numbers, when we start seeing, we're already seeing a lot of the minor crime.
[01:47:47.535 --> 01:47:48.635]  We're seeing the carjackings.
[01:47:49.176 --> 01:47:51.156]  We're seeing, and major crime as well.
[01:47:51.797 --> 01:47:55.118]  But we have not seen that spillover yet, but that's what we're concerned about.
[01:47:55.358 --> 01:47:56.939]  But, you know, as you well know, Alex,
[01:47:57.270 --> 01:48:01.374]  The number two city in the world for kidnapping is Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:48:01.634 --> 01:48:02.595]  Mexico City is first.
[01:48:02.655 --> 01:48:03.656]  Phoenix, Arizona is second.
[01:48:03.676 --> 01:48:04.557]  Yeah, it's already here.
[01:48:04.738 --> 01:48:06.579]  And the media covers up most of it.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:10.323]  And the diseases and the cholera and the drug-resistant TB.
[01:48:10.383 --> 01:48:13.006]  It's bankrupting the states with all the anchor babies.
[01:48:13.406 --> 01:48:15.588]  This country is going to fall apart if we don't do something.
[01:48:15.648 --> 01:48:17.771]  All I have to say, sir, is I appreciate what you're doing.
[01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:18.691]  We're going to support you.
[01:48:18.852 --> 01:48:20.013]  I'd like to get you a studio.
[01:48:20.453 --> 01:48:22.455]  Someday here in Austin, or I'd like to send a crew down.
[01:48:22.475 --> 01:48:24.557]  But in closing, I've got to disagree with you though.
[01:48:25.018 --> 01:48:27.100]  I am for drug decriminalization.
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:32.906]  If that happened, these drug gangs would start trying to murder politicians that try to decriminalize.
[01:48:33.306 --> 01:48:38.831]  If we decriminalize, not legalize, that would end the $400 billion profit that is funding these people.
[01:48:39.312 --> 01:48:43.376]  Well, I know in Mexico, supposedly their government is looking at that.
[01:48:44.893 --> 01:48:53.436]  In closing, let me just say once again, Alex, I appreciate your focus on this and also I invite people to go to my Facebook page, Dan Patrick.
[01:48:54.096 --> 01:48:59.117]  Be my friend and we keep in touch with what's going on on a regular basis.
[01:48:59.277 --> 01:49:01.198]  Lastly, I'd like to share and take ten seconds.
[01:49:02.438 --> 01:49:06.480]  We have an award-winning documentary that we have done which is an incredible story.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:12.522]  It's a true story about Texas and it has sold thousands and thousands of copies.
[01:49:12.562 --> 01:49:13.762]  It's called The Heart of Texas.
[01:49:14.444 --> 01:49:19.709]  And if you go to Heart of Texas, the movie, I was the executive producer of the Heart of Texas, themovie.com.
[01:49:19.809 --> 01:49:20.830]  It's a Christian film.
[01:49:21.631 --> 01:49:29.038]  It's a Christian film, but it's a film about what all of us face in life at some point, and that's forgiveness.
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:34.784]  And it's a wonderful, true story that's one of the most amazing stories your audience and you will ever see.
[01:49:34.824 --> 01:49:35.745]  I'll send you over a copy.
[01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:38.411]  And I think you'll be on the air saying, folks, you've got to see this.
[01:50:06.370 --> 01:50:09.394]  They tried to come in and take over the drug cartel profits for themselves.
[01:50:09.434 --> 01:50:10.336]  That's what's really going on.
[01:50:10.797 --> 01:50:11.277]  Stay with us.
[01:50:14.938 --> 01:50:18.320]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:23.684]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:50:23.864 --> 01:50:28.647]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:50:29.027 --> 01:50:40.135]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:50:40.535 --> 01:50:46.077]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:50:46.317 --> 01:50:52.378]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:50:52.578 --> 01:50:53.219]  What about you?
[01:50:53.619 --> 01:50:59.640]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:51:16.029 --> 01:51:18.130]  A new world order.
[01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:23.031]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:51:23.051 --> 01:51:26.532]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:51:26.572 --> 01:51:28.773]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:51:29.333 --> 01:51:31.754]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:51:32.512 --> 01:51:39.836]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:51:42.884 --> 01:51:47.847]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:51:48.308 --> 01:51:51.770]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:51:52.190 --> 01:51:54.672]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:51:54.752 --> 01:51:55.893]  Most people have no idea.
[01:51:55.913 --> 01:51:56.693]  They're not after money.
[01:51:56.713 --> 01:51:57.774]  They have all the money they need.
[01:51:57.974 --> 01:51:58.695]  They're after power.
[01:51:58.955 --> 01:51:59.815]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:52:09.582 --> 01:52:11.203]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:52:11.643 --> 01:52:12.684]  You have been warned.
[01:52:15.766 --> 01:52:19.830]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[01:52:20.290 --> 01:52:23.252]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.

[01:52:58.498 --> 01:53:03.320]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades, and he can help you.
[01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:04.500]  Call us today, 800-346-6829.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:04.900]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:53:20.356 --> 01:53:21.056]  Yeah, folks.
[01:53:22.858 --> 01:53:37.926]  The CIA and the big money laundering banks, we told you this year before it happened, from Celica Stillo and other contacts from the DEA, is going to try to take down four major and a few sub-cartels that weren't paying their cut to the central banks, just like the U.S.
[01:53:37.946 --> 01:53:40.408]  military invaded Colombia over the park not paying their cut.
[01:53:41.909 --> 01:53:44.230]  And the drug gangs are fighting back because they're not cowards.
[01:53:46.291 --> 01:53:46.872]  But, uh,
[01:53:48.171 --> 01:53:51.093]  The media covers up the dead cops and citizens here in the U.S.
[01:53:51.153 --> 01:53:52.534]  It's much worse than you were even hearing.
[01:53:53.435 --> 01:53:57.318]  And the SPP, North American Union, talks about Mexico collapsing and using that.
[01:53:57.378 --> 01:53:58.779]  Calderon was put in there to do this.
[01:53:59.679 --> 01:54:00.960]  And we're not just saying that today.
[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:02.762]  We said that years ago.
[01:54:03.502 --> 01:54:04.883]  We said that as Fox was leaving.
[01:54:04.923 --> 01:54:05.744]  This is the plan.
[01:54:06.084 --> 01:54:07.625]  Crises, order out of chaos.
[01:54:07.986 --> 01:54:10.007]  I want to hit this story about taking blood from children.
[01:54:10.027 --> 01:54:11.408]  I'm going to get some guests on about that.
[01:54:12.349 --> 01:54:18.234]  But before we go any further, I wanted to briefly just tell you about one of our great sponsors, Ecolablue.com.
[01:54:18.834 --> 01:54:20.275]  Fabulous atmospheric water generator.
[01:54:20.295 --> 01:54:22.757]  It's like a water cooler that has hot and cold water, seven filters.
[01:54:23.078 --> 01:54:25.860]  It goes through, but no water or no water bottle attached to it.
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:27.721]  And I show this to people and they can't believe it.
[01:54:28.082 --> 01:54:30.524]  The air you're in is filled with water.
[01:54:31.325 --> 01:54:40.577]  And it doesn't come out of a, you know, city utility system that's full of mercury and lead and sodium fluoride and chlorine and all the dead bacteria.
[01:54:40.597 --> 01:54:42.159]  Because, you know, it just kills the bacteria.
[01:54:42.179 --> 01:54:44.222]  You're eating all those dead bacteria and other particulate.
[01:54:45.936 --> 01:54:47.037]  So give Ecolablue a call.
[01:54:47.057 --> 01:54:47.998]  It's just a fabulous system.
[01:54:48.018 --> 01:54:48.058]  800-691-6043.
[01:54:48.078 --> 01:54:48.438]  800-691-6043 is the number.
[01:54:48.458 --> 01:54:48.819]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:54:48.839 --> 01:54:48.899]  1-800-691-6043.
[01:54:48.939 --> 01:54:49.920]  For survival, just for clean water.
[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:51.001]  Guaranteed no fluoride in this, baby.
[01:54:51.021 --> 01:54:52.723]  I mean, this is just fabulous water.
[01:54:52.783 --> 01:54:53.463]  I drink it constantly.
[01:54:53.483 --> 01:54:55.726]  In fact, I need to fill my glass back up.
[01:54:55.766 --> 01:54:56.166]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:55:08.851 --> 01:55:12.772]  Alright, I keep mentioning this the last two days, but I haven't really gotten into it, and I need to.
[01:55:12.792 --> 01:55:16.253]  So I'm going to try to remember, guys, tomorrow to spend 20 minutes on this.
[01:55:17.213 --> 01:55:18.334]  But it's just so important.
[01:55:18.454 --> 01:55:21.194]  Texans unknowingly donate children's blood to research.
[01:55:21.875 --> 01:55:24.815]  And this Austin American Statesman story itself is a whitewash.
[01:55:25.275 --> 01:55:30.357]  Medical privacy advocates, ethicists say parents should be asked for consent before newborn screening samples are kept.
[01:55:30.797 --> 01:55:34.338]  They lie and say it's a state law, like they lie and say taking vaccines is a state law.
[01:55:34.878 --> 01:55:40.959]  And they take your baby's blood for a blood test, but with the health department set up under eugenics instead of the hospital doing the test.
[01:55:41.459 --> 01:55:48.101]  And it goes into a federal database and is sold to international companies who isolate proteins and DNA and then patent it.
[01:55:48.161 --> 01:55:51.901]  And then there's been federal cases where they say they own your blood and you want to get a gene therapy.
[01:55:51.921 --> 01:55:53.642]  This company has your genes already sequenced.
[01:55:54.062 --> 01:55:58.863]  It goes through the registry and they say, you know, you've got to pay us all this money to be able to have your own gene therapy.
[01:56:00.165 --> 01:56:08.691]  For almost seven years, another lie, it's 36, the state has identified storing blood from nearly all newborns in Texas without their parents' consent for possible use in medical research.
[01:56:08.711 --> 01:56:10.272]  It's not possible use, it's being done.
[01:56:10.953 --> 01:56:12.894]  The blood is, remember, I've been telling you this for 13 years.
[01:56:13.315 --> 01:56:15.956]  The blood is collected as part of a 44-year-old state mandate.
[01:56:15.976 --> 01:56:16.537]  So see, they're saying 44.
[01:56:17.377 --> 01:56:18.258]  First it's 7, then it's 44.
[01:56:19.239 --> 01:56:20.960]  I've confirmed, globally, 36 years.
[01:56:23.072 --> 01:56:24.172]  How many years did I tell you that?
[01:56:24.833 --> 01:56:25.993]  I showed you government documents.
[01:56:26.433 --> 01:56:33.296]  The blood is collected as part of a 44-year-old state mandate newborn screening program in which hospitals, birthing centers, and midwives draw blood from a baby seal.
[01:56:33.316 --> 01:56:35.877]  See, it's not law, it's mandated.
[01:56:38.117 --> 01:56:40.618]  The state either discards the blood after six months, total lie.
[01:56:41.018 --> 01:56:42.538]  They store it in Michigan and San Antonio.
[01:56:43.038 --> 01:56:45.339]  Or more recently, store it for three years before destroying it.
[01:56:45.679 --> 01:56:46.179]  Another lie.
[01:56:46.839 --> 01:56:50.500]  I'm not saying this Marianne Roser is bad, she just doesn't know what she's talking about.
[01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:58.882]  But starting in 2002, the State Health Department began collecting and keeping blood indefinitely for current or future medical research, a practice that has been the subject of legal challenge in Minnesota.
[01:56:58.982 --> 01:57:01.523]  We had those people on fighting it last year.
[01:57:02.523 --> 01:57:04.204]  Five dots of blood are collected on paper.
[01:57:04.264 --> 01:57:06.425]  No, they take ampules out of the baby seal, folks.
[01:57:06.465 --> 01:57:07.446]  Not just the five dots.
[01:57:07.506 --> 01:57:09.427]  And are collected on paper for screening and then stored.
[01:57:09.547 --> 01:57:15.970]  Under the Health Department's policy, the samples can be used for medical community, for things like cancer research, birth defect studies, and calibration of lab equipment.
[01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:21.112]  Now, they're using it for a DNA database on you, and it's popping up with insurance refusing people coverage.
[01:57:22.393 --> 01:57:24.114]  We are out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:25.666 --> 01:57:27.548]  But I will be back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:57:27.588 --> 01:57:28.108]  to 3 p.m.
[01:57:28.128 --> 01:57:36.795]  This show grows when you spread the word about the free podcast, about the AM and FM affiliates, all our great stations, about how you can listen on Shortwave, and we had Dr. Edwin Vieira on.
[01:57:36.875 --> 01:57:47.524]  I covered a lot of other news in the start of the show, so powerful info coming up right now as we start retransmission at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:47.764 --> 01:57:50.826]  Great job to the crew and the producers, Rob and Joey.
[01:57:51.367 --> 01:57:52.027]  God bless you all.
[01:57:52.047 --> 01:57:52.948]  We'll see you back live tomorrow.
[01:57:52.988 --> 01:57:53.288]  Stay with us.
[01:57:53.308 --> 01:57:54.089]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:58.361]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:58.862 --> 01:58:02.244]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:04.445 --> 01:58:05.045]  Hello, friends.
[01:58:05.085 --> 01:58:06.046]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.146 --> 01:58:10.749]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:10.889 --> 01:58:13.650]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:58:13.850 --> 01:58:16.712]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:58:16.912 --> 01:58:21.615]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:58:21.835 --> 01:58:22.776]  If you simply prepare.
[01:58:22.976 --> 01:58:25.879]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:33.107]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:58:33.207 --> 01:58:36.350]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:58:36.490 --> 01:58:36.751]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:58:39.153 --> 01:58:41.594]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:58:41.614 --> 01:58:47.698]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:58:47.878 --> 01:58:51.200]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:52.400]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:53.041]  Take action today.
[01:58:53.061 --> 01:58:54.281]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:08.613 --> 01:59:10.115]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
