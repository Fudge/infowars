[00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.913]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.913 --> 00:00:11.494]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.494 --> 00:00:13.035]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:17.239]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:21.302]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.522]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you for joining us for this worldwide transmission.
[00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:35.603]  It is Tuesday, the 24th day of February 2009.
[00:00:35.603 --> 00:00:41.126]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:41.126 --> 00:00:52.211]  We've got Dr. Edwin Vieira scheduled for later in the transmission today to get his take on not just the states moving, now close to 30 of them moving towards sovereignty.
[00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:56.193]  Some states are now passing those resolutions, like Oklahoma.
[00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:00.991]  We don't just have him coming on about that.
[00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:14.336]  We're going to be discussing how sheriffs and counties and quote, committees of safety, that's what the Sons of Liberty first set up in the decade before the Revolutionary War, are being set up across the United States as well as a counter to the globalists.
[00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:20.012]  Other than that, I've got a lot of important news I want to go over today.
[00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:35.367]  Very important information as things just accelerate and develop faster and faster inside this New World Order system and as the people awaken and the establishment attempts to block that awakening and suppress the people.
[00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:39.711]  I do want to take a lot of phone calls in this first hour, second hour, third hour, fourth hour today.
[00:01:42.213 --> 00:02:06.483]  You know I've said this probably a thousand times and I'll say it again and overall I've gotten better about going to the calls when I give the number out but I tend to get stuck on each call going over all their questions and comments and then trying to break it down in some detail but in the interest of people being able to get on the show who can never get through I'll just say that anybody who can call who wants to but I would like
[00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:20.911]  To give first-time callers and folks who haven't been able to get through a chance on the air a chance to hear from military, a chance to hear from police about all the urban warfare gun confiscation drills going on across the country.
[00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:30.719]  A chance for the population to talk about the fact that $9.7 trillion has been stolen by the offshore banks out of the United States just from the United States alone.
[00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.561]  They're also looting other nations in the name of bailouts to fix the economy.
[00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:39.324]  It's a type of financial terrorism where they stage the crisis and say, do whatever we say.
[00:02:39.324 --> 00:02:42.306]  Give us unlimited power and funds or the world will end.
[00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:47.590]  And then as people capitulate, things only get worse because we're being routed through financial
[00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.071]  Military attack, financial warfare.
[00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:55.452]  As the Japanese say, all business is war.
[00:02:55.452 --> 00:02:58.673]  Well, it certainly is with the international bankers.
[00:02:58.673 --> 00:03:01.254]  The toll-free number to join us on air today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:01.254 --> 00:03:01.334]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:03.395]  And we will get you up and on the air today.
[00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:22.156]  Here are some of the important news stories I have in front of me.
[00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:26.718]  Bill seeks to withhold highway funds to states who don't comply with Real ID.
[00:03:26.718 --> 00:03:36.963]  Yeah, Bush signed an executive order last year saying that if states didn't let foreign companies take over their infrastructure and put toll roads on them, they wouldn't get their money.
[00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:46.748]  They take our state money, and then the states sign over their sovereignty, not just to the criminal federal government, but to the offshore corporations and banks that are looting us.
[00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:58.052]  This dovetails with a CBS News report that you would think was a big expose about thousands of offshore tax havens and how a lot of the bailout money is going to that.
[00:04:00.182 --> 00:04:07.507]  But really, they're just setting a precedent to set up a world regulatory body over all of this, and then they will selectively enforce it themselves.
[00:04:07.507 --> 00:04:17.033]  It's the very banks and brokerage firms that run the New World Order that don't pay taxes, don't pay corporate taxes, and don't pay private taxes.
[00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:22.996]  Remember, over 65% of the Congress, on record, doesn't pay taxes.
[00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:25.118]  This is a pack of criminals.
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.001]  So we'll go over Bill seeks to withhold highway funds to states who don't comply with REAL ID.
[00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:37.362]  Rupert Murdoch warns nations will be redefined, futures altered.
[00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:50.885]  There's a new story out of KRMG claiming that I basically put out the hoax of the camera in the digital converter box when we exposed the hoax.
[00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:54.506]  Thanks a lot to KRMG, that's really nice of you.
[00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:56.326]  And we'll get into a lot more, stay with us.
[00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:02.109]  We're good to go.
[00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:39.315]  And it creates an alkaline environment where cancer can't grow and parasites cannot live, and brings funguses, viruses and bacterial levels down and to a halt.
[00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:41.156]  Try our powder seeds and oil today.
[00:05:41.156 --> 00:05:45.500]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.462]  If the body has the proper nutrition it will heal itself.
[00:05:48.462 --> 00:05:52.565]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:55.087]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:56.348]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:06.592]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:06:06.592 --> 00:06:07.913]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:07.913 --> 00:06:09.915]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:09.915 --> 00:06:16.940]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:25.466]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:32.936]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:32.936 --> 00:06:36.118]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:36.118 --> 00:06:41.882]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:06:41.882 --> 00:06:44.964]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:44.964 --> 00:06:52.189]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[00:06:54.753 --> 00:06:56.314]  This is a government-sponsored terror.
[00:06:56.314 --> 00:07:00.435]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:07:00.435 --> 00:07:07.799]  Yourfoodstorage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest-priced, highest-quality, storable food for over a decade.
[00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:12.081]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds four to five people is only $39.95.
[00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.041]  That's right.
[00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:17.103]  A one-year supply that feeds four to five people for under $4,000.
[00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:17.923]  That's only 92 cents per
[00:07:20.913 --> 00:07:21.434]  We're good to go.
[00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:39.811]  We're good to go!
[00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:27.268]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.268 --> 00:08:30.590]  Every day the mainstream media is forced to admit
[00:08:32.236 --> 00:08:37.318]  That the climate change, global warming crowd are a pack of liars.
[00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:39.198]  But they always say, oh, it's a mistake.
[00:08:39.198 --> 00:08:46.921]  They accidentally at weather monitoring sites across the planet claim that carbon dioxide levels were raising faster than they were.
[00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:54.523]  Oh, they accidentally claimed that the earth was getting hotter in 2008 when it actually had record cold temperatures in the last hundred years.
[00:08:55.283 --> 00:08:58.028]  Oh, they accidentally did this, they accidentally did that.
[00:08:58.028 --> 00:09:06.962]  Like Al Gore in his film, The Inconvenient Fraud, I mean, The Inconvenient Lie, shows that carbon dioxide levels rise and that then heat rises.
[00:09:08.206 --> 00:09:32.445]  When in all of the government and university studies, the heat level rises from the sun predominantly, and then there's more life forms on the planet in warm weather, and so more carbon dioxide is exhaled by humans and animals and insects and plankton, and then carbon dioxide levels go up, and then that accelerates the life cycle.
[00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:45.288]  The earth blooms in hot cycles, just like the earth itself has seasons, depending on its axis and its rotation and where it is in its orbit around the sun.
[00:09:45.288 --> 00:09:48.109]  And so this is a spring and summertime when it's warming.
[00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:50.890]  It is a fall and wintertime when it's cooling.
[00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.770]  And that's just a fact.
[00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.491]  And the establishment knows that.
[00:09:53.491 --> 00:10:01.493]  But there's another story in the New York Times today that I want to go through later, where it says, Gore pulls slide of disaster trends.
[00:10:02.666 --> 00:10:12.534]  And he's tying in tsunamis and wildfires and earthquakes, I've seen him do this before, showing that disasters went up in the last 10 years.
[00:10:15.441 --> 00:10:24.384]  Which has nothing to do, even if you believe that global warming is real or man-made, it has nothing to do with it.
[00:10:24.384 --> 00:10:38.689]  And by the way, I have some mainstream news articles here where the governments of Europe and England are proposing not just taxes on cows and sheep and goats and fish and all meat, not just taxes on your trash, taxes on light bulbs, toilets,
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:46.987]  Taxes on fireplaces are banning space heaters, saying they hurt the climate.
[00:10:46.987 --> 00:10:56.517]  They want to tax countries when they have forest fires because so much carbon dioxide is put off when there are forest fires.
[00:10:57.549 --> 00:11:00.612]  Natural forest fires.
[00:11:00.612 --> 00:11:07.219]  And there are also environmental groups in mainstream news proposing cutting down trees.
[00:11:07.219 --> 00:11:08.060]  No, I'm not kidding.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.582]  You can't make this up.
[00:11:09.582 --> 00:11:10.923]  Cutting down trees.
[00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:18.135]  Because trees also put off carbon dioxide.
[00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:20.516]  I mean, this is such a joke.
[00:11:20.516 --> 00:11:23.038]  But they mean it to be ridiculous and over the top.
[00:11:23.038 --> 00:11:25.440]  Because if they can set the precedent for this, they can set the precedent for anything.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.923]  But Gore pulls slide of disaster trends.
[00:11:31.803 --> 00:11:45.153]  Former President Al Gore, Vice President, is pulling a dramatic slide from his ever-evolving global warming presentation when Mr. Gore addressed the packed cheering hall at the annual meeting of American Association for Advancement of Science in Chicago earlier this month.
[00:11:45.153 --> 00:11:51.198]  His climate slideshow contained a startling graph showing a ceiling-high spike of disasters in recent years.
[00:11:51.198 --> 00:11:58.724]  The data came from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters at the Catholic University of Lothian in Brussels.
[00:12:01.052 --> 00:12:12.238]  The graph, which was added to his talk last year, just came after a sequence of images of people from Iowa to South Australia struggling with drought, wildfires and flooding, and other weather-related calamities.
[00:12:12.238 --> 00:12:18.001]  Mr. Gore described the pattern as a manifestation of human-driven climate change, and he went on.
[00:12:18.001 --> 00:12:23.344]  But now they go on to say that now Mr. Gore is dropping the graph, his office of today.
[00:12:23.344 --> 00:12:24.285]  Here's why.
[00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:30.148]  Two days after the talk, Mr. Gore was sharply criticized for using the data to make a point about global warming by Roger A.
[00:12:31.598 --> 00:12:32.618]  Pyle Kerr, Jr.
[00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:35.820]  I want to get him on the show.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.461]  A political scientist focused on disaster trends and climate policy at the University of Colorado.
[00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:54.087]  Mr. Paykel noted that the Center for Research on Epidemiology of Disaster Stress reports that a host of factors unrelated to climate cause the enormous rise in reported disasters.
[00:12:54.927 --> 00:12:57.749]  Yeah, like earthquakes and tsunamis.
[00:12:57.749 --> 00:13:02.432]  The tsunami was caused by an underwater huge tectonic plate shift.
[00:13:02.432 --> 00:13:05.894]  Nothing to do with your SUVs, I assure you.
[00:13:05.894 --> 00:13:21.904]  That huge tectonic plate shift a few years ago that killed hundreds of thousands with tidal waves, tsunamis crashing across multiple countries, island nations, had as much to do with SUVs and coal-powered plants
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:34.785]  As much to do with that as coal power plants have a connection to the polar ice caps of Mars receding or expanding.
[00:13:34.785 --> 00:13:35.906]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:13:37.281 --> 00:13:59.929]  This is the crowd though that says that polar bears can't swim and are drowning because the ice is melting and they point a video camera at a glacier that every spring and summer collapses large portions of it and creates ice flows because throughout the winter months rain and snow fall on the glaciers piling up and then it literally flows out
[00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:03.190]  In some cases, miles a year towards the sea.
[00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.050]  I mean, that's how glaciers work.
[00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:19.673]  But they know the public is dumbed down and completely focused on issues of little or no significance, so they really believe that the polar bears can't swim and that glaciers aren't supposed to be expanding and contracting and going into the sea.
[00:14:19.673 --> 00:14:22.213]  There have always been icebergs, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:22.213 --> 00:14:25.294]  That's what happens when the Arctic and the Antarctic
[00:14:26.218 --> 00:14:26.658]  I think so.
[00:14:46.138 --> 00:14:46.338]  That was
[00:15:03.786 --> 00:15:07.208]  You know, humans, and it was coming, and it was part of the life cycle.
[00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:12.530]  And I remember saying to my wife, I bet that satellite malfunctions or blows up.
[00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.571]  Well, it did blow up.
[00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:15.311]  Didn't work too well.
[00:15:15.311 --> 00:15:16.472]  Somebody didn't want that going up.
[00:15:16.472 --> 00:15:20.033]  I mean, how many NASA rockets fail?
[00:15:20.033 --> 00:15:21.094]  It's a very low number.
[00:15:21.094 --> 00:15:22.774]  But this one, of course, failed.
[00:15:22.774 --> 00:15:23.975]  I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
[00:15:26.744 --> 00:15:37.873]  A satellite launched from California failed to reach orbit today, crashing into the sea near Antarctica and dooming a $273 million mission to study global warming gases.
[00:15:37.873 --> 00:15:38.754]  The mission is lost.
[00:15:38.754 --> 00:15:46.861]  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman Steve Cole said in a telephone interview from the launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
[00:15:47.955 --> 00:16:05.160]  The NASA satellite was to orbit 438 miles above the Earth and observe how carbon dioxide enters and leaves the atmosphere, helping scientists predict future increases in the main greenhouse gas, blamed, notice these legalese there, they don't say proven, for global warming.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:12.322]  Instead, the satellite fell into the ocean near Antarctica through the mission, managers said, at no point did the craft pass over land.
[00:16:15.026 --> 00:16:24.358]  You know, speaking of spacecraft falling back into the earth, two Sundays ago, a gigantic piece of satellite came in over Austin.
[00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:32.147]  CNN was videotaping a, what was live, out of their affiliate News 8 Austin at the Marathon downtown.
[00:16:33.462 --> 00:16:40.230]  And I was on the radio at the time, but I watched the video feed later, and it looked like something out of a science fiction movie.
[00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.855]  A giant fireball burning red and orange and blue comes in.
[00:16:44.855 --> 00:16:46.057]  It's huge.
[00:16:46.057 --> 00:16:49.140]  You know, normally you see a video of a meteor or something, and it's just a tiny streak.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.822]  I mean, it looked like something out of a movie.
[00:16:51.403 --> 00:17:01.528]  Just this huge fireball comes in and then starts exploding at about 20,000 feet, explodes again at about 10,000, and then disappears into West Austin.
[00:17:01.528 --> 00:17:07.610]  The last time I heard they never found the debris, though some have said a bunch of trees got blown down.
[00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.991]  What did local news do?
[00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:15.874]  Like Bob Cole and Bucky Godbolt Show on one of the popular morning shows.
[00:17:15.874 --> 00:17:19.996]  They made jokes about me being a conspiracy theorist and that aliens were landing or something.
[00:17:21.311 --> 00:17:22.312]  I mean, that's how it works.
[00:17:22.312 --> 00:17:31.081]  I mean, a satellite comes in, blows up over Austin, looks like War of the Worlds or something, and then there's jokes about me.
[00:17:31.081 --> 00:17:35.166]  When I don't cover space aliens and Chupacabras like Larry King does and the rest of them.
[00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:39.784]  You know, I'm the guy pointing out that these aren't cigar-shaped UFOs.
[00:17:39.784 --> 00:17:47.786]  These are giant government blimps with four fins on them and surveillance and hanging off the bottom and on the sides of the craft.
[00:17:47.786 --> 00:17:51.507]  They keep showing on the news every week saying aliens are invading.
[00:17:51.507 --> 00:17:56.448]  Blisters of solar panels.
[00:17:56.448 --> 00:17:58.829]  I mean, it's the Homeland Security blimps they admittedly launched in 2002-2003.
[00:18:01.035 --> 00:18:04.216]  But the government won't admit what they are, so the media says they must be aliens.
[00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:08.618]  Meanwhile, I get the blame for that when I'm the one exposing real conspiracy theories.
[00:18:08.618 --> 00:18:11.999]  Now, another example of that I mentioned earlier.
[00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:13.099]  I'm not going to spend much time on this.
[00:18:13.099 --> 00:18:15.520]  I'm going to try to get this guy on the show.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:21.582]  I'm not going to be mean to the hoaxer, because we learned he's actually contacted us and admits that it was a hoax.
[00:18:21.582 --> 00:18:30.525]  But, KRMG Morning News blog, out of Tulsa, Oklahoma,
[00:18:32.577 --> 00:18:58.423]  comes out and says that basically I launched a hoax and that I gave the hoax national attention and implies I promoted it as real when I'm the one that exposed that it was a hoax by going and buying a digital TV converter the Magnavox same brand that went viral on YouTube last week and we opened it up and showed that it did not have a camera and microphone
[00:18:59.451 --> 00:19:13.558]  And we proved that it wasn't just that this individual, you know, had a different one than his had a camera, because it's the exact same circuitry from his video that's inside the one we bought, and there's no circuitry in there for the camera or the microphone.
[00:19:13.558 --> 00:19:15.819]  And so I get blamed for it.
[00:19:15.819 --> 00:19:17.360]  I'm the one that did the hoax.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.241]  I'm the one who put out the disinformation.
[00:19:20.241 --> 00:19:27.044]  I'm the one who did this, when I'm the one that exposed it.
[00:19:27.044 --> 00:19:27.925]  And then when a real
[00:19:30.011 --> 00:19:36.633]  piece of space junk blows up over Austin in spectacular fashion and rains down on West Austin.
[00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:39.694]  It's my fault!
[00:19:39.694 --> 00:19:50.357]  I mean, this is the type of baloney, and they've written several big articles attacking me in the press about the gun confiscation drills in Arcadia, when that's what it is.
[00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:54.838]  Shutting down the city, going door to door, and asking if they can search their cupboards and houses.
[00:19:54.838 --> 00:19:56.198]  That's a gun confiscation drill.
[00:19:56.198 --> 00:19:58.259]  They admit it's, quote, going after an arms dealer.
[00:20:00.757 --> 00:20:09.003]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:20:09.003 --> 00:20:13.566]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:20:13.566 --> 00:20:18.229]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:20:18.229 --> 00:20:19.630]  It's a documented fact.
[00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:27.293]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:20:27.293 --> 00:20:39.377]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[00:20:39.377 --> 00:20:43.038]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:20:43.638 --> 00:20:46.781]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:20:46.781 --> 00:20:50.524]  FPP is so affordable, you can't afford to do without.
[00:20:50.524 --> 00:20:55.749]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:20:55.749 --> 00:20:57.650]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:07.659]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:07.659 --> 00:21:09.381]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:10.273 --> 00:21:11.814]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:11.814 --> 00:21:12.615]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:12.615 --> 00:21:13.616]  This is his M.O.
[00:21:13.616 --> 00:21:14.977]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:14.977 --> 00:21:16.978]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:16.978 --> 00:21:24.144]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:24.144 --> 00:21:24.624]  Some U.S.
[00:21:24.624 --> 00:21:30.269]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:30.949 --> 00:21:34.472]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:34.472 --> 00:21:37.274]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:05.613]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:22:05.613 --> 00:22:07.014]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:22:07.014 --> 00:22:10.896]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:13.818]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:22:13.818 --> 00:22:15.880]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.181]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:22:19.242 --> 00:22:33.730]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800, but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.012]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:22:37.012 --> 00:22:39.213]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-GOLD.
[00:22:40.454 --> 00:22:44.238]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:22:44.238 --> 00:22:46.580]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.301]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:22:47.301 --> 00:22:49.924]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[00:22:49.924 --> 00:22:50.985]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:23:01.385 --> 00:23:09.470]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.071]  You need the Paclite!
[00:23:11.071 --> 00:23:19.315]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:22.857]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[00:23:22.857 --> 00:23:27.700]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.961]  The Paclite is so durable,
[00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:34.043]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[00:23:34.043 --> 00:23:38.724]  The PackLite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:23:38.724 --> 00:23:45.707]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.
[00:23:45.707 --> 00:23:48.288]  That address again is 9voltlite.com.
[00:23:49.268 --> 00:23:50.830]  Or, call us today at 877-715-4448.
[00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.011]  That's 877-715-4448.
[00:24:07.233 --> 00:24:07.853]  We're good to go.
[00:24:27.023 --> 00:24:33.385]  Together, they've collected more than $227 billion from Citigroup to Morgan Stanley.
[00:24:33.385 --> 00:24:41.647]  Even as they benefit from the tax money, they operate hundreds of subsidiaries in places widely known for helping people evade taxes.
[00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:48.629]  Although proponents say most business in tax havens is perfectly legal and legitimate, it's estimated that tax havens cost U.S.
[00:24:48.629 --> 00:24:52.690]  taxpayers $100 billion a year in lost revenue.
[00:24:53.678 --> 00:25:09.001]  The stakes are so high, this tax haven insider was put under witness protection after he exposed hundreds of tax dodgers and testified to Congress about his job.
[00:25:09.001 --> 00:25:16.583]  One favorite among the bailout companies, the Cayman Islands, where there's no income tax, no corporate tax, no capital gains tax.
[00:25:17.805 --> 00:25:20.789]  Goldman Sachs has 15 subsidiaries there.
[00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:22.712]  Bank of America, 59.
[00:25:22.712 --> 00:25:24.174]  Citigroup, 90.
[00:25:24.174 --> 00:25:30.042]  But Morgan Stanley beats them all with at least 158 subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands.
[00:25:30.042 --> 00:25:31.945]  Seven times the number of hotels.
[00:25:32.509 --> 00:25:34.071]  How hard is it for the U.S.
[00:25:34.071 --> 00:25:38.075]  government to get at what's going on in some of these tax havens?
[00:25:38.075 --> 00:25:39.076]  It's incredibly hard.
[00:25:39.076 --> 00:25:47.985]  Former Congressional Tax Investigator Dean Zerbe says the Treasury Department should demand that bailed out banks cough up details of their offshore interests.
[00:25:47.985 --> 00:25:48.185]  Alright.
[00:25:48.185 --> 00:25:48.565]  That's good.
[00:25:52.225 --> 00:25:53.706]  Alright, you can watch the whole report.
[00:25:53.706 --> 00:25:59.549]  We have a link to it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:25:59.549 --> 00:26:06.053]  Now, you hear those type reports and it's like, ooh, the news is getting tough on these tax cheats.
[00:26:06.053 --> 00:26:12.117]  But it is the very brokerage firms and banks that make up the New World Order system in their own words.
[00:26:12.117 --> 00:26:14.578]  You can watch them during the Davos meeting we had a few weeks ago.
[00:26:14.578 --> 00:26:17.960]  Just open talk of world government, now they're going to run everything.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.581]  They have two sets of rules.
[00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:20.402]  One for the public.
[00:26:21.445 --> 00:26:22.486]  And then one for themselves.
[00:26:22.486 --> 00:26:30.571]  Look at Secretary of Treasury Geithner not paying taxes and being confronted with it years ago and saying, I'm not going to pay.
[00:26:30.571 --> 00:26:35.575]  Look at the majority of Congress not paying taxes.
[00:26:35.575 --> 00:26:36.335]  Just Google that.
[00:26:36.335 --> 00:26:39.998]  The majority of Congress doesn't pay taxes and see the reports that come out every year.
[00:26:41.243 --> 00:26:44.324]  Because it's not enforced on themselves.
[00:26:44.324 --> 00:26:50.366]  And so what's happening is the big central banks have created over $1,000 trillion in derivatives.
[00:26:50.366 --> 00:26:53.547]  They've bought up most of the real assets in the world.
[00:26:53.547 --> 00:26:59.889]  Now they want to rob the nouveau riche, the new wealth, and wealthy people that aren't on the inside with them.
[00:26:59.889 --> 00:27:04.911]  And I've looked at the UBS raids on tens of thousands of account holders.
[00:27:04.911 --> 00:27:06.711]  Now they want 54,000 more accounts in UBS alone.
[00:27:08.772 --> 00:27:20.441]  with the Swiss banking system and if you look at these accounts you know they'll be a million dollars ten million dollars it sounds like a big number but these are low-level people that put their money in the Swiss banks.
[00:27:20.441 --> 00:27:32.450]  The Swiss signed deals what was it six years ago with the UN to join the European Union to get rid of their bank secrecy and so that's why you see this happening but the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Portugal
[00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:36.513]  The Cook Islands, Paraguay, the list goes on and on.
[00:27:36.513 --> 00:27:45.021]  That's where Luxembourg, that's where people like Vladimir Putin, he has his money, it's been reported in Luxembourg and a few other places in Europe.
[00:27:45.021 --> 00:27:48.965]  Those aren't being touched and they're not going to be touched.
[00:27:48.965 --> 00:27:56.733]  So what you have is the elite doesn't like the fact that in the last decade or so, even people that only make a few hundred thousand dollars a year,
[00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:06.725]  In some cases even less, started using these tax shelters and these offshore banks because it became retail.
[00:28:06.725 --> 00:28:11.493]  Main Street tax attorneys began recommending this to people in huge services.
[00:28:12.845 --> 00:28:19.912]  And so the loophole laws were written where the big banks and brokerage firms are allowed under federal law.
[00:28:19.912 --> 00:28:35.328]  That's like Halliburton owns Cayman Islands subsidiaries that came out that were selling nuclear weapons components and oil field equipment to Iraq during the 14 years of sanctions and to Iran.
[00:28:36.527 --> 00:28:38.708]  You know, they even came out in mainstream news.
[00:28:38.708 --> 00:28:44.130]  And Halliburton said, well this is completely legal, because their lobbyists wrote the laws.
[00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:58.155]  And so, they even got laws passed where the federal government would pay tax incentives to offshore industries, businesses, banks, to where they even got tax breaks to pay for the offshoring.
[00:28:59.221 --> 00:29:08.493]  And so now they're just introducing this to the public and saying, oh look, your bailout money, hundreds of billions of it, went to offshore accounts.
[00:29:08.493 --> 00:29:09.835]  They're just keeping your money.
[00:29:09.835 --> 00:29:12.158]  Well, what do you think criminals are going to do?
[00:29:12.158 --> 00:29:13.219]  They're going to steal.
[00:29:14.349 --> 00:29:28.153]  This is what the upper crust of the establishment, basically a bunch of Bernard Madoffs, and then now more and more big Ponzi schemes are coming out and people are discovering that every major bank out there is involved in scams and pension funds are going down the drain.
[00:29:28.153 --> 00:29:29.594]  This has been planned by design.
[00:29:30.154 --> 00:29:37.060]  But they don't want you being able to get your money offshore, so they're clamping down selectively on the people.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:42.064]  I'll finish up breaking down how this works when we get back, then get into headlines like this one from CNN.
[00:29:42.064 --> 00:29:46.228]  Pennsylvania rocked by jailing kids for cash scandal.
[00:29:46.228 --> 00:29:47.729]  They do that right here in Austin.
[00:29:47.729 --> 00:29:51.052]  Does anybody care?
[00:29:51.052 --> 00:29:52.433]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.433 --> 00:29:54.975]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.975 --> 00:29:57.658]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.118 --> 00:30:07.081]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:30:07.081 --> 00:30:11.863]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:30:11.863 --> 00:30:17.285]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:30:17.285 --> 00:30:20.667]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:30:21.207 --> 00:30:29.715]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:30:29.715 --> 00:30:35.520]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.526]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:30:41.526 --> 00:30:43.828]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:46.770]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?

[00:30:52.513 --> 00:30:54.994]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.

[00:30:56.135 --> 00:30:57.376]  It is a big idea.
[00:30:57.376 --> 00:30:58.656]  A new world order.
[00:30:58.656 --> 00:31:05.821]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:10.419 --> 00:31:13.261]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:13.261 --> 00:31:16.043]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:16.043 --> 00:31:19.225]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:19.225 --> 00:31:26.530]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.574 --> 00:31:34.998]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:34.998 --> 00:31:38.880]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.442]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:41.442 --> 00:31:42.623]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:42.623 --> 00:31:43.403]  They're not after money.
[00:31:43.403 --> 00:31:44.684]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:44.684 --> 00:31:45.405]  They're after power.
[00:31:45.405 --> 00:31:46.806]  That's what they're after these years.
[00:31:46.806 --> 00:31:55.531]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.531 --> 00:31:58.353]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:31:58.353 --> 00:31:59.414]  You have been warned.
[00:32:00.914 --> 00:32:01.695]  Attention.
[00:32:01.695 --> 00:32:04.736]  This is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[00:32:04.736 --> 00:32:11.818]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:11.818 --> 00:32:13.298]  Here is why.
[00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:23.221]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:26.483]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:32:26.483 --> 00:32:28.605]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:32:28.605 --> 00:32:29.586]  this fall?
[00:32:29.586 --> 00:32:30.567]  Don't wait.

[00:33:17.943 --> 00:33:21.745]  We are here live, and hey, I'm the hardest working guy on radio.
[00:33:21.745 --> 00:33:24.127]  I come back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:27.489]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:27.489 --> 00:33:28.029]  That's 2 to 4 Pacific.
[00:33:33.271 --> 00:33:35.232]  I want to give it out in Greenwich Mean Time.
[00:33:35.232 --> 00:33:37.593]  I have a lot of global listeners out there.
[00:33:37.593 --> 00:33:40.534]  Frank, Matt, Eric, Steve, Randy, and many others.
[00:33:40.534 --> 00:33:46.996]  Your calls are coming up, and as soon as you hear me hang up on a caller, or a caller say bye-bye, you can get in on the line.
[00:33:46.996 --> 00:33:52.138]  I want to hear from police, military, people in business, on the economy, the police state, everything.
[00:33:52.138 --> 00:33:54.919]  I want everybody to have a chance to get involved on air today.
[00:33:54.919 --> 00:33:54.979]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:01.658 --> 00:34:05.481]  Okay, just in summation, then I'm going to your calls.
[00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:25.277]  You see, international laws were written, nation states adopted national systems to comply with it, where the upper crust elites basically pay less than 1% corporate tax, and themselves individually pay almost no tax.
[00:34:28.226 --> 00:34:41.353]  And then they take the public's money in all the taxes we pay, and most of that is fenced through into corporate welfare and corporate contracts, and open payment on interest on the debt to the central banks.
[00:34:41.353 --> 00:34:43.374]  This is how the game is played.
[00:34:43.374 --> 00:34:44.514]  This is how it works.
[00:34:44.514 --> 00:34:48.716]  Their business, their corporate business, is controlling governments and taxing you.
[00:34:48.716 --> 00:34:55.800]  And so, for over a hundred years, the big central banks have had offshore corporations and front corporations.
[00:34:56.505 --> 00:35:16.396]  But as tens of millions of people in the United States and even more worldwide began using these legal loopholes, the IRS and the exchequer over in England and others began going after people selectively and selectively closing those loopholes and selectively prosecuting people.
[00:35:17.324 --> 00:35:30.850]  And so in the last five years or so, many Americans and many British, in fact Britain is the fastest to be losing their population, have been leaving and moving to these tax havens and that's panicking the establishment.
[00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:43.175]  And so the OECD, the Organization of Economic Cooperative Development, that's the name of the private corporation that was set up to launder all the money from the reconstruction
[00:35:44.946 --> 00:35:53.248]  The Marshall Plan that was done after World War II, they used a similar system in Japan to take over those countries.
[00:35:53.248 --> 00:35:55.748]  It wasn't rebuilding them for free.
[00:35:55.748 --> 00:35:57.748]  They're controlled by the central banks.
[00:35:57.748 --> 00:36:11.891]  The OECD has been saying in big reports that you can pull up and read, just Google OECD tax havens, tax avoidance havens, and they admit their main target is the retail offshore
[00:36:12.992 --> 00:36:20.483]  Somebody who just sticks, you know, over a decade, a million, two million, three million dollars in these offshore tax havens.
[00:36:20.483 --> 00:36:23.248]  Which is totally legal, but they don't care.
[00:36:23.248 --> 00:36:25.651]  Through legalese they go after you.
[00:36:27.082 --> 00:36:49.287]  And so they'll have a CBS news piece like this one saying, oh isn't it horrible, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of the bailout money through the banks and brokerage firms went to these offshore tax havens and the IRS can grandstand like little saviors and go, it's not fair, people are losing their health care, losing their jobs, losing their homes, and the bailout money went to offshore banks and they're keeping it.
[00:36:49.287 --> 00:36:51.008]  We need to crack down on these.
[00:36:54.212 --> 00:36:54.952]  And it's the same thing.
[00:36:54.952 --> 00:37:11.021]  Remember a few weeks ago Obama said, I am outraged, this is outrageous that we have these banks that are failing and they're keeping the money for big parties and executives and hundreds of billions in bonuses to their executives and I'm putting a total cap on it of $500,000.
[00:37:13.646 --> 00:37:38.011]  And then you read the executive order, it says all of the big banks and the previous recipients are exempt from this and in the future it will be left to agency discretion, the Securities and Exchange Commission and others, who will be prosecuted under this and then it doesn't even give any laws or regulations or force of law, it just says we'll make up whatever we want.
[00:37:42.867 --> 00:37:44.688]  You understand how that works?
[00:37:44.688 --> 00:37:58.054]  And so if you can get a position in government, if you can get a position in one of these big banks, if you can get a position in one of these big brokerage firms, you have a license to steal, to do whatever you want, whenever you want, however you want.
[00:37:58.054 --> 00:38:01.416]  And there's example of this after example of this.
[00:38:01.416 --> 00:38:08.439]  This is a illegitimate government, just like Mexico is an illegitimate government, now in full collapse.
[00:38:08.439 --> 00:38:09.540]  Full collapse.
[00:38:11.343 --> 00:38:14.064]  How many years ago did we tell you that was already in play?
[00:38:14.064 --> 00:38:16.406]  And this is all by design.
[00:38:16.406 --> 00:38:22.109]  And I'm going to cover that more, but I want to get to your calls.
[00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:23.209]  And then I have all these stories.
[00:38:23.209 --> 00:38:27.692]  You know, some of them I've mentioned in the past, but now they're getting national attention.
[00:38:27.692 --> 00:38:30.934]  Pennsylvania rocked by jailing kids for cash.
[00:38:30.934 --> 00:38:38.558]  Millions of dollars per judge from private youth homes that get federal funds for the children.
[00:38:39.645 --> 00:38:54.954]  And it goes through the cases, and you can go, you know, each article is really a whitewash, but if you read 20 or 30 articles on this subject, and there's been that many the last three weeks since this broke just in Pennsylvania alone, it's going on everywhere.
[00:38:54.954 --> 00:39:00.918]  And since this story came out, my hope has come true that people are now noticing it's happening in their towns.
[00:39:00.918 --> 00:39:04.740]  A lot of folks need to go to jail in Austin, Texas, folks.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:09.103]  They're so criminal here, it's on record they're paying people off.
[00:39:10.339 --> 00:39:11.860]  And if you don't like it, a SWAT team will drop by.
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:16.244]  I mean, that's pretty much how it works.
[00:39:16.244 --> 00:39:23.450]  A girl put up a MySpace account making fun of her principal.
[00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.271]  No cuss words, no nothing.
[00:39:25.271 --> 00:39:30.576]  And she was given six months in a, quote, forest work camp.
[00:39:33.007 --> 00:39:35.848]  If you're late to class three times, they trigger truancy laws.
[00:39:35.848 --> 00:39:42.531]  The truancy law doesn't even say three late to classes is an absence, and one absence isn't truancy under any of these state laws.
[00:39:42.531 --> 00:39:43.251]  They don't care!
[00:39:43.251 --> 00:39:44.791]  You still go to jail!
[00:39:44.791 --> 00:39:47.673]  That's what I keep explaining to people!
[00:39:47.673 --> 00:39:54.115]  I've been at the juvenile court hearings, which is just a made-up, fake court set up under the eugenicist in the U.S.
[00:39:54.115 --> 00:40:01.698]  a hundred years ago, just like they have a court, their own court for vaccines, funded by the vaccine companies, just like Monsanto owns its own court on GMO.
[00:40:02.881 --> 00:40:12.668]  That'll rule that when they contaminate you, the Missouri Court rules that you owe them money because they contaminated your field.
[00:40:12.668 --> 00:40:15.970]  They write the rules!
[00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:22.775]  And I've made films about this, I've done so many local TV shows about this, and no one's brought to justice.
[00:40:22.775 --> 00:40:23.756]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:40:23.756 --> 00:40:24.577]  I mean, here in Austin,
[00:40:25.802 --> 00:40:27.924]  You put your child in a public school, you're asking for it.
[00:40:27.924 --> 00:40:29.285]  They do one thing wrong.
[00:40:29.285 --> 00:40:30.625]  They raise their voice.
[00:40:30.625 --> 00:40:34.828]  The police write them a ticket for disturbing the peace.
[00:40:34.828 --> 00:40:36.970]  Then they call them before a judge.
[00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:38.011]  It's all legalese.
[00:40:38.011 --> 00:40:41.874]  They order the family to sign an agreement that the child's on probation.
[00:40:42.975 --> 00:40:47.518]  A contract, and the next time your child's late to class, they go to jail.
[00:40:47.518 --> 00:41:01.446]  And then federal and state money kicks in, and then if they can say your child's mentally ill and put them on Prozac or Ritalin, they go from getting $3,000 or $4,000 a month in these facilities to in some cases as much as $10,000 a month.
[00:41:04.568 --> 00:41:16.417]  And it is just... I mean, I've had listeners who've investigated this send me the different state agency filings online to show what these big foster care centers make, these private ones.
[00:41:16.417 --> 00:41:19.099]  And it'll show what the director of one of them makes.
[00:41:19.099 --> 00:41:21.260]  And it'll be hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.401]  I mean, they live in palaces.
[00:41:22.401 --> 00:41:23.702]  They're driving Porsches.
[00:41:23.702 --> 00:41:25.163]  They have yachts.
[00:41:25.163 --> 00:41:29.687]  So of course they can pay a few mil to a judge.
[00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:32.689]  Now, go back to how many past shows I told you they were doing this.
[00:41:32.689 --> 00:41:33.730]  Now it's in the news.
[00:41:40.287 --> 00:41:44.851]  Pennsylvania rocked by jailing kids for cash scandal.
[00:41:44.851 --> 00:41:58.423]  At a friend's sleepover more than a year ago, 14-year-old Phillip Schwartley pocketed change from unlocked vehicles in the neighborhood by buying chips and soft drinks.
[00:41:58.423 --> 00:41:59.624]  The cops caught him.
[00:41:59.624 --> 00:42:03.087]  There was no need for an attorney, said Phillip's mother, Amy Schwartley.
[00:42:04.724 --> 00:42:09.947]  Who thought, at most, the judge would slap her son with a fine or community service.
[00:42:09.947 --> 00:42:15.790]  But she was shocked to find her eighth grade handcuffed and shackled in the courtroom and sentenced to a youth detention center.
[00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:20.053]  Then he was shipped to a boarding school for troubled teens for nine months.
[00:42:20.053 --> 00:42:21.674]  Now see, they give the whitewash ones here.
[00:42:21.674 --> 00:42:31.540]  You go read the local Pennsylvania articles, late to class three times, posting a joke about the principal under her free speech.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.980]  Well, it's incredible.
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.781]  I covered that last week.
[00:42:36.035 --> 00:42:40.982]  Yes, my son made a mistake, but I don't think he was going to be taken away from me, said swartley.
[00:42:40.982 --> 00:42:42.945]  Well, you put him in a prison camp, lady.
[00:42:42.945 --> 00:42:45.169]  That's meant to induct your child into institutions.
[00:42:46.673 --> 00:42:50.994]  A 41-year-old single mother raising two boys in Wilkes Bar, Pennsylvania.
[00:42:50.994 --> 00:42:57.575]  CNN does not usually identify minors accused of crimes, but Swartley and others agreed to name, to bring public attention to the issue.
[00:42:57.575 --> 00:43:08.437]  As scandals from Wall Street to Washington, Royal Public Trust, the Justice Department system of Luzerine County, in the heart of Pennsylvania's struggling coal country, has also fallen prey to corruption.
[00:43:08.437 --> 00:43:15.678]  See, folks, the criminals to carry out crimes and bid rigging and stealing and double sets of books in every government agency,
[00:43:17.222 --> 00:43:42.109]  Every government agency has a comprehensive annual financial report that was set up by the Mafia in the 20s in Chicago, nationally adopted in 1951, 1313 model, and then they have to recruit more criminals in to their system so that they're protected while they carry out crime, and then they can't really say no because they're compromised to the lower level criminals, so they all set up their own scams, and then society just collapses.
[00:43:46.277 --> 00:43:52.023]  And it goes on, the county has been rocked by a kickback scandal involving two elected judges who essentially jailed kids for cash.
[00:43:52.023 --> 00:43:55.106]  Many of the children had appeared before judges without a lawyer.
[00:43:55.106 --> 00:43:56.287]  Well, the courts aren't real.
[00:43:56.287 --> 00:44:00.371]  These family courts aren't constitutional.
[00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:05.035]  We didn't have them till about 1920s.
[00:44:05.035 --> 00:44:07.337]  The few areas had them earlier.
[00:44:07.337 --> 00:44:10.601]  And they were called racial hygiene courts.
[00:44:12.386 --> 00:44:19.088]  That's where the social services and the health department, it's all designed to kill you.
[00:44:19.088 --> 00:44:20.029]  See my film, Endgame.
[00:44:20.029 --> 00:44:28.651]  I have the mainstream newsreel clips that they showed in movie theaters about how they were sterilizing people in 34 states.
[00:44:28.651 --> 00:44:31.933]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:44:31.933 --> 00:44:41.576]  The non-profit juvenile law center in Philadelphia said Philip is one of at least 5,000 children over the past five years who have appeared before former Luzerine County Judge Mark
[00:44:44.886 --> 00:44:47.108]  He's now pled guilty.
[00:44:47.108 --> 00:44:56.756]  And then it just goes into the story here about the private juvenile detention centers owned by Mid-Atlantic Youth Services Corps.
[00:44:56.756 --> 00:44:59.418]  They're still operating and are not a target of the federal investigation.
[00:44:59.418 --> 00:45:01.780]  Of course not, according to court documents.
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.461]  They're going to be left alone.
[00:45:03.461 --> 00:45:05.243]  And it goes through all the payoffs that were made.
[00:45:10.373 --> 00:45:12.776]  And then it just goes into the reason the kids were put in jail.
[00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:14.417]  But this CNN's a whitewash.
[00:45:14.417 --> 00:45:16.139]  Go read the local reports.
[00:45:16.139 --> 00:45:19.583]  Late to class three times, six months in a forest labor camp.
[00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:23.607]  Forest work camp.
[00:45:23.607 --> 00:45:25.649]  Oh, you said something on an internet site.
[00:45:25.649 --> 00:45:26.831]  No First Amendment.
[00:45:26.831 --> 00:45:27.672]  Six months in jail.
[00:45:29.292 --> 00:45:32.833]  A year in jail and then you read what happened to these kids.
[00:45:32.833 --> 00:45:36.674]  Some of them die in custody, others come out totally mind blown.
[00:45:36.674 --> 00:45:39.895]  They hop them up, they're away from their parents, they're on Prozac, Ritalin.
[00:45:39.895 --> 00:45:42.796]  They start having seizures and they put them in a mental institution.
[00:45:42.796 --> 00:45:44.837]  Oh, then the cash really racks up.
[00:45:44.837 --> 00:45:48.098]  And after the kid's done, 18 years old, totally brain fried,
[00:45:48.758 --> 00:45:56.380]  Shock therapy, they throw them out on the street, and that's the people you laugh at that have the signs saying, we'll work for food.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.841]  Most of them aren't even winos.
[00:45:57.841 --> 00:46:01.942]  I've talked to them, they've been in mental institutions, and I go, tell me your story.
[00:46:01.942 --> 00:46:06.043]  Well, I was 12, I got in a fist fight, and the guy's 32, looks like he's 60.
[00:46:08.854 --> 00:46:10.675]  I'll do a documentary on these guys.
[00:46:10.675 --> 00:46:16.860]  And I got in a fight at the back of the school and then they put me in juvenile and started drugging me.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.001]  I know I'm crazy, I deserve it.
[00:46:19.001 --> 00:46:21.223]  They shocked me over and over again.
[00:46:21.223 --> 00:46:24.185]  And then... Let me guess, when you're 18 they let you go.
[00:46:24.185 --> 00:46:31.050]  Yeah, I've been on the streets since then.
[00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.372]  That's your sickening, degenerate government.
[00:46:35.646 --> 00:46:38.190]  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:45.021]  The more drugs, the more shock therapy, the more torture, the more Thorazine.
[00:46:45.021 --> 00:46:46.023]  That's why 67% of U.S.
[00:46:46.023 --> 00:46:47.105]  foster children, and Google that,
[00:46:52.429 --> 00:46:54.990]  Are on more than one psychotropic drug.
[00:46:54.990 --> 00:47:01.592]  Because when they seize your child and then hop him up on drugs, the money just starts going ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:47:01.592 --> 00:47:13.497]  I mean that cash register, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, just goes off the charts and the cash rolls in.
[00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:14.197]  All right, that's enough.
[00:47:14.197 --> 00:47:15.317]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:47:15.317 --> 00:47:17.718]  And I'm gonna take them all through this hour into the next.
[00:47:17.718 --> 00:47:19.939]  And then I'm gonna get into, we have a state senator coming on.
[00:47:21.621 --> 00:47:27.384]  Who's talking about state sovereignty and putting troops on the border through the state of Texas.
[00:47:27.384 --> 00:47:35.047]  We've got another guest on this issue as well.
[00:47:35.047 --> 00:47:37.128]  Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[00:47:37.128 --> 00:47:38.809]  But I mentioned this yesterday.
[00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:39.769]  I didn't spend enough time on it.
[00:47:39.769 --> 00:47:41.650]  Sometime today I've got to get into it.
[00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.731]  Because I was called a conspiracy theorist.
[00:47:43.731 --> 00:47:44.411]  I was laughed at.
[00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:45.452]  I've been attacked everywhere.
[00:47:46.465 --> 00:47:55.968]  for this, even though I had Australian lawmakers on, I had federal congressmen on, I had state reps on who discovered this.
[00:47:55.968 --> 00:48:02.971]  I remember hearing when I first got on talk radio 13 years ago that when they take blood from babies' heels at the hospital, it went into a UN database.
[00:48:02.971 --> 00:48:08.713]  Well, I decided to go down at that time to the microfiche at the UT library, one of the best in the country.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:31.294]  And I pulled it all up and found out it was going into DNA testing, that they claim that they own your blood, they then patent your blood, there's now been federal cases where you go in, when you get cancer, they give to you the vaccines, and you want your own DNA treatment, you find out, oh, a company's already patented your blood, that's why this is starting to come out, and you gotta pay them to be able to have this gene therapy.
[00:48:31.294 --> 00:48:32.735]  And they go, well, how'd you get my blood?
[00:48:32.735 --> 00:48:35.157]  Well, it's part of a research project.
[00:48:35.157 --> 00:48:37.939]  And that's finally in the news, but that's only one facet.
[00:48:38.399 --> 00:48:43.802]  They also now have your blood, large ampules of it, freeze-dried, to plant.
[00:48:43.802 --> 00:48:48.825]  And the FBI Crime Lab on record, under Frederick Whitehurst, admits it was industrialized fraud.
[00:48:48.825 --> 00:48:49.885]  They just frame everybody.
[00:48:49.885 --> 00:48:54.928]  The Houston Crime Lab's been caught, the Dallas Crime Lab, every major crime lab, and they have your blood.
[00:48:54.928 --> 00:49:01.151]  That's why they're trying to push national DNA databases now for people they didn't get in this system who aren't 36 or younger, 35 or younger.
[00:49:03.729 --> 00:49:10.393]  And then they bill it as, oh, we're freeing a lot of innocent people on death row because of DNA.
[00:49:10.393 --> 00:49:20.139]  And the police want to take your blood for misdemeanors at checkpoints now, for any basic misdemeanor, so they can take good care of you.
[00:49:20.139 --> 00:49:20.780]  Sure.
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.542]  Hey, cops, you're a good cop?
[00:49:23.542 --> 00:49:24.862]  Wonder how they're going to frame you?
[00:49:24.862 --> 00:49:30.346]  Well, they can place your fingerprints at the scene by having everybody knows that.
[00:49:30.346 --> 00:49:31.487]  They can frame you with that blood.
[00:49:32.608 --> 00:49:33.669]  You know, I believe O.J.
[00:49:33.669 --> 00:49:37.991]  Simpson was probably guilty, but I'm not going to wade in on that debate.
[00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:43.755]  He was certainly covering something up, but the police did get caught planting the blood.
[00:49:43.755 --> 00:49:44.075]  Why?
[00:49:44.075 --> 00:49:53.701]  Because it has the MBTE blood preservative in it, so it doesn't rot.
[00:49:55.049 --> 00:49:58.690]  And it also had the plastic chemicals in it from the tube.
[00:49:58.690 --> 00:49:59.851]  So, you know, that came out.
[00:49:59.851 --> 00:50:02.251]  The point is, this is to frame you.
[00:50:02.251 --> 00:50:04.192]  Now, that's not the biggest problem.
[00:50:04.192 --> 00:50:08.473]  You've heard about this Human Genome Project that's at the Cold Springs Harbor.
[00:50:08.473 --> 00:50:10.914]  That's where the Eugenics Records Office is.
[00:50:10.914 --> 00:50:12.535]  It's the same building.
[00:50:12.535 --> 00:50:16.136]  IBM runs that, founded to carry out eugenics.
[00:50:16.136 --> 00:50:17.756]  It's a trust to carry out eugenics.
[00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:20.779]  We're good to go.
[00:50:40.984 --> 00:50:46.465]  Go around the world, quote, testing your roots, getting you to donate your blood to find out who's righted to who.
[00:50:46.465 --> 00:50:50.266]  That's being done because with the race-specific bioweapons they found were all related.
[00:50:50.266 --> 00:50:56.988]  They're trying to isolate subtypes so they can more orderly kill 99% of the population.
[00:50:56.988 --> 00:50:57.328]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.437 --> 00:51:03.438]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:51:03.438 --> 00:51:10.381]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:51:10.381 --> 00:51:18.784]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:24.507]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:51:24.687 --> 00:51:26.529]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:51:26.529 --> 00:51:28.831]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:51:28.831 --> 00:51:33.255]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:51:33.255 --> 00:51:35.477]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:51:35.477 --> 00:51:43.324]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:52:01.097 --> 00:52:07.762]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.762 --> 00:52:09.424]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.376 --> 00:52:11.938]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.938 --> 00:52:12.738]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.738 --> 00:52:13.739]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:13.739 --> 00:52:15.081]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:15.081 --> 00:52:17.083]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:17.083 --> 00:52:24.250]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:24.730]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:30.376]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:31.056 --> 00:52:34.577]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.577 --> 00:52:37.358]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.811 --> 00:53:03.332]  What will you do when the economy collapses?
[00:53:03.332 --> 00:53:06.292]  Store shelves are empty and your stored food is gone.
[00:53:06.292 --> 00:53:08.132]  How will you feed your family?
[00:53:08.132 --> 00:53:15.474]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.
[00:53:15.474 --> 00:53:22.915]  GetSeeds.net is offering 100 different varieties of GM-free vegetable seeds for only $49 with free shipping.
[00:53:22.915 --> 00:53:24.536]  You get over 14,000 seeds for only $49.
[00:53:26.596 --> 00:53:27.016]  We're good to go.
[00:53:51.681 --> 00:53:54.584]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[00:54:19.118 --> 00:54:28.764]  The State Department has issued another warning saying Mexico is the most dangerous place in the world.
[00:54:28.764 --> 00:54:32.686]  But parents still let their high school seniors and college students that they're paying for.
[00:54:32.686 --> 00:54:36.689]  People say, well they're college kids, well you're paying for their education.
[00:54:36.689 --> 00:54:42.052]  Go to Mexico so they can be robbed and shot up.
[00:54:42.052 --> 00:54:43.854]  And Mexico is collapsing, that's coming up.
[00:54:43.854 --> 00:54:45.395]  But right now, let's go to your calls.
[00:54:46.756 --> 00:54:50.138]  Frank in New York, welcome!
[00:54:50.138 --> 00:54:51.839]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:58.283]  I just wanted to make a couple comments, and I thought your analysis was very interesting.
[00:54:58.283 --> 00:55:04.107]  It's always, for the bankers, the tax avoidance versus tax evasion.
[00:55:04.107 --> 00:55:16.234]  And when you have a corrupt government that has a very complex and burdensome tax code, as the United States has, whoever has the best legal counsel and the biggest assets usually can
[00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:17.270]  We're good to go.
[00:55:33.601 --> 00:55:46.869]  Before the income tax law was set up, they were able, through their attorneys, to set up tax-exempt foundations and trusts that prevented them from having to pay their burden that they should have paid.
[00:55:46.869 --> 00:55:50.371]  Yeah, it's only for the idiot public, in their words, to pay.
[00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:51.392]  Absolutely.
[00:55:51.392 --> 00:55:58.416]  And what I wanted to say, too, all of this talk about the carbon tax, I find really dangerous.
[00:55:59.867 --> 00:56:01.609]  It's kind of ridiculous.
[00:56:01.609 --> 00:56:06.053]  I think what we should do... Well, sir, sir, sir, it's not talk.
[00:56:06.053 --> 00:56:09.577]  Obama has announced yesterday they are implementing it.
[00:56:09.577 --> 00:56:12.139]  Yes, but here's what should happen.
[00:56:12.139 --> 00:56:23.811]  I think the Rockefellers, the DuPonts, the Rothschilds, the Nobels, the Royal Family in England, the Dutch Royal Family with Dutch Shell,
[00:56:24.474 --> 00:56:43.329]  The descendants of Armand Hammer, including Al Gore, who's one of the biggest shareholders in Oxygen and Petroleum, these companies over the last 200 to the last 70 years have raped the world, caused these problems, and they've been able to profit handsomely by that.
[00:56:43.329 --> 00:56:49.874]  Before we talk about enforcing a global carbon tax on the population, it's time to tax
[00:56:50.487 --> 00:56:57.113]  Those who rape the planet, and when their assets are diminished, then maybe we can discuss taxing the general population.
[00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:57.974]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:56:57.974 --> 00:56:59.395]  I think that has to be done.
[00:56:59.395 --> 00:57:01.937]  You know, Al Gore is the majority shareholder.
[00:57:01.937 --> 00:57:04.559]  He's one of the directors of Occidental Petroleum.
[00:57:04.559 --> 00:57:09.604]  He actually owns a company also involved chopping down rainforests, but see, that's the cover.
[00:57:09.604 --> 00:57:15.128]  That's like when Prescott Bush came out, was the top Nazi agent in the U.S.
[00:57:15.128 --> 00:57:16.850]  He hurriedly founded the
[00:57:18.251 --> 00:57:29.533]  The group that goes out and has Hollywood people and musicians, the USO, to the military because, oh, it's impossible that the top Nazi is bringing us all this entertainment.
[00:57:29.533 --> 00:57:35.875]  And so exactly, one of the major carbon trading companies is owned by Al Gore.
[00:57:35.875 --> 00:57:37.595]  He is the principal in that.
[00:57:37.595 --> 00:57:40.216]  And you will pay your carbon taxes to Al Gore.
[00:57:40.216 --> 00:57:41.136]  It's very, very funny.
[00:57:41.956 --> 00:57:49.622]  To him, and instead of people worrying about all the real environmental crises and serious problems there are, we'll sit there and let these guys rip us off.
[00:57:49.622 --> 00:57:51.464]  But the public likes to be schmucks.
[00:57:51.464 --> 00:57:54.666]  That's why they're going to lose their houses and everything else they've got.
[00:57:54.666 --> 00:58:03.333]  That's the case, but I think right now what's interesting, Alex, is people are losing their jobs and they have no income to pay.
[00:58:03.333 --> 00:58:04.293]  The bankers are ruthless.
[00:58:04.293 --> 00:58:05.474]  They will give us no quarter.
[00:58:05.474 --> 00:58:07.796]  And the public still says, hurt me, hurt me more.
[00:58:07.796 --> 00:58:08.196]  Hurt me.
[00:58:08.196 --> 00:58:09.597]  I love to be a schmuck.
[00:58:09.597 --> 00:58:10.158]  Please hurt me.
[00:58:10.717 --> 00:58:16.838]  Well, hopefully as the people lose their assets, their savings, they'll wise up very quickly.
[00:58:16.838 --> 00:58:21.219]  And I think they will want their pound of flesh when they realize... I hear you, Frank.
[00:58:21.219 --> 00:58:22.539]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[00:58:22.539 --> 00:58:30.200]  Yeah, a lot of people are actually waking up and others still cozy up to the government and the media and go, oh, Obama's helping me.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.181]  Oh, everything's fine.
[00:58:32.181 --> 00:58:33.781]  I'm going to trust the government.
[00:58:33.781 --> 00:58:34.881]  It's so good.
[00:58:34.881 --> 00:58:38.262]  All right, we'll be right back in 70 seconds with more of your calls.
[00:58:38.262 --> 00:58:38.682]  Stay with me.
[00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:46.632]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.895 --> 00:58:51.535]  Hello, friends.
[00:58:51.535 --> 00:58:52.595]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:57.338]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.338 --> 00:59:00.299]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.299 --> 00:59:03.341]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.341 --> 00:59:08.063]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.283 --> 00:59:09.405]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.405 --> 00:59:12.649]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:19.658]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:59:53.553 --> 00:59:55.955]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.955 --> 01:00:05.361]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.361 --> 01:00:06.661]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.661 --> 01:00:08.422]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.422 --> 01:00:10.184]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.184 --> 01:00:11.765]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.765 --> 01:00:13.326]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.326 --> 01:00:17.508]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.508 --> 01:00:21.571]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.251 --> 01:00:31.236]  Yeah, we just had a great caller earlier, but I want to attempt to take a call every two minutes or so so I can get a lot of people in.
[01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:35.118]  We have Dr. Edwin Vieira coming up to get into the state's rights rebellion against tyranny.
[01:00:35.118 --> 01:00:42.703]  We also have a state senator from Texas making national headlines about putting Texas Guard and state police on the border because the feds won't do it.
[01:00:42.703 --> 01:00:43.503]  That is coming up.
[01:00:43.503 --> 01:00:45.704]  But right now, let's go to Matt in Canada.
[01:00:45.704 --> 01:00:47.265]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:00:47.265 --> 01:00:48.166]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:48.946]  Good day.
[01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:49.987]  Hello, good day to you, my friend.
[01:00:50.882 --> 01:00:59.009]  I was just wondering, I heard you talking before in a lot of previous episodes that a lot of your films aren't actually getting through to Canada through the mail.
[01:00:59.009 --> 01:01:01.811]  I was wondering if this was going to be the same thing with Obama deception.
[01:01:02.915 --> 01:01:10.800]  Well, I talked to my shipping guys and they explained to me two days ago that it isn't as bad as it used to be.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.803]  Before, half the time they would tear up the package, break the tape, send it back.
[01:01:14.803 --> 01:01:21.648]  We would even mail them as bulk groups in two customs and then they would inspect the main bulk and then it would go out from UPS.
[01:01:22.228 --> 01:01:23.849]  And then they would still send those back.
[01:01:23.849 --> 01:01:30.293]  But we told UPS that if they didn't pressure Canada and didn't fix it, and we even tried some other companies, we weren't going to do it anymore.
[01:01:30.293 --> 01:01:34.996]  And I'm told that now about 95% are making it into Canada.
[01:01:34.996 --> 01:01:39.318]  So things have suddenly gotten a lot better in the last six months.
[01:01:39.318 --> 01:01:42.000]  So I was brought up to speed on that.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.324]  But still, Canada is the hardest place in the world to get our videos into.
[01:01:48.324 --> 01:01:51.086]  Also, a lot of it is, we've changed the name on the package.
[01:01:52.285 --> 01:01:55.327]  That we ship out on, so that may be helping.
[01:01:55.327 --> 01:01:56.107]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:01:56.107 --> 01:01:59.488]  I was also wondering, have you ever heard of iDoser?
[01:01:59.488 --> 01:02:01.489]  It's music?
[01:02:01.489 --> 01:02:02.810]  No.
[01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:06.492]  Basically, I thought it would be a really great medium for waking people up.
[01:02:06.492 --> 01:02:17.977]  What it is, is it's basically just random tones played, and basically it gives you the effect of either like a mild antidepressant, a strong antidepressant, or even painkillers and other things like that.
[01:02:18.308 --> 01:02:25.050]  Yeah, I've read about the power of music to either heighten mental awareness or lower it, and so I am aware of that.
[01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:27.711]  Yes, I am aware of the power of sound.
[01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:46.916]  Well, any of your listeners who have family members who really are sort of still skeptical about the power of media control and mind control and anything like that, I highly recommend them to check out the iDoser, because some of them are only five minute long songs, and you can really, a song with random tones will just start to make you laugh and giggle.
[01:02:47.421 --> 01:02:48.782]  Because that's what it's meant to do.
[01:02:48.782 --> 01:02:52.985]  I'll tell you what, John, go pull an iDocer up off of YouTube and we'll play one later.
[01:02:52.985 --> 01:02:54.106]  Thank you, Matt.
[01:02:54.106 --> 01:02:55.427]  Eric in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:02:55.427 --> 01:02:58.169]  How are you doing today?
[01:02:58.169 --> 01:02:59.670]  Good, sir.
[01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:01.671]  Alright, I just had a quick question for you.
[01:03:01.671 --> 01:03:06.955]  I don't know if you've heard about this yet, I'm a police officer here in Texas.
[01:03:06.955 --> 01:03:12.059]  House Resolution 748, the Campus Safety Act of 2009.
[01:03:12.059 --> 01:03:14.561]  Basically what it entails
[01:03:15.382 --> 01:03:19.664]  It's basically the federal takeover of all the campus police agencies in the United States.
[01:03:19.664 --> 01:03:22.705]  Yes, it federalizes all of the colleges.
[01:03:22.705 --> 01:03:24.446]  That's what Homeland Security's going to do.
[01:03:24.446 --> 01:03:31.088]  Under this FEMA camp bill, they've already built the FEMA camps, it makes the local police go under its control.
[01:03:31.088 --> 01:03:39.432]  This is, sir, PDD 51, all of them, John Warner Defense Authorization Act, everything's being federalized, and then you will be a federal officer
[01:03:40.112 --> 01:03:43.193]  Yeah, that's kind of a concern that a lot of us are having right now.
[01:03:43.193 --> 01:03:44.894]  I've talked to some of our TAC guys.
[01:03:44.894 --> 01:03:47.735]  I'm one of the fireman instructors in our department.
[01:03:47.735 --> 01:03:48.835]  So we've been talking about this a lot.
[01:03:48.835 --> 01:03:49.755]  And with Obama's new million man
[01:04:08.464 --> 01:04:11.149]  I don't know what he's going to call it, his Gestapo or whatever.
[01:04:11.149 --> 01:04:12.151]  It seems as though, at least to us,
[01:04:20.669 --> 01:04:24.291]  That this is a replacement force for your local police.
[01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:27.172]  Oh no, they've announced, sir, they've already done this in the third world.
[01:04:27.172 --> 01:04:33.535]  That you're all, but don't worry, you're gonna, if you lick boots properly, you'll get a job for private, stay there.
[01:04:33.535 --> 01:04:35.396]  Stay there, officer, I want to talk more to you, okay, Eric?
[01:04:35.396 --> 01:04:36.556]  Can you stay there?
[01:04:36.556 --> 01:04:37.256]  Sure will.
[01:04:37.256 --> 01:04:39.778]  Okay, we'll be back in three minutes.
[01:04:39.778 --> 01:04:42.179]  Folks, this is a plan, okay?
[01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:43.559]  It isn't privatization.
[01:04:43.559 --> 01:04:44.640]  Think piracy.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.721]  They're hijacking everything.
[01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:53.581]  They're taking over all the local governments, the campuses, the schools, the medical.
[01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:55.041]  Look, it's all being federalized.
[01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:56.322]  Don't have to believe me.
[01:04:56.322 --> 01:04:58.522]  They just federalized the medical system.
[01:04:58.522 --> 01:05:06.385]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:06.385 --> 01:05:07.865]  It's now winter.
[01:05:07.865 --> 01:05:09.286]  Hello, cold.
[01:05:09.286 --> 01:05:10.626]  Hello, Mr. Flu.

[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.380]  Uh, P.S.
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:01.102]  I've been drinking it for years.
[01:06:01.102 --> 01:06:07.865]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:07.865 --> 01:06:09.546]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:10.498 --> 01:06:12.039]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:12.819]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.819 --> 01:06:13.840]  This is his M.O.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.200]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.201]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:24.345]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:24.345 --> 01:06:24.825]  Some U.S.
[01:06:24.825 --> 01:06:30.508]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:31.168 --> 01:06:34.650]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:36.831]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:01.998 --> 01:07:03.975]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck, eFoods.com.
[01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:18.652]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[01:07:18.652 --> 01:07:26.694]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[01:07:26.694 --> 01:07:33.755]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[01:07:33.755 --> 01:07:35.796]  Food is an everyday need.
[01:07:35.796 --> 01:07:36.896]  The 3-Day Responder
[01:07:37.395 --> 01:07:37.775]  Big Brother!
[01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:08.830]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:10.590]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:12.170]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:13.711]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.711 --> 01:08:17.912]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.912 --> 01:08:25.294]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.294 --> 01:08:27.194]  Let me just briefly explain what happened.
[01:08:27.194 --> 01:08:30.815]  Then we'll go back to Eric in Texas, the peace officer.
[01:08:30.815 --> 01:08:31.756]  Firearms instructor.
[01:08:31.756 --> 01:08:36.377]  I guess armorer would be the term properly used.
[01:08:39.315 --> 01:08:50.988]  Give him the Greek name Festus, the armorer for Vulcan, but that's a little bit of the old system.
[01:08:50.988 --> 01:08:54.913]  Look, this is how it works.
[01:08:54.913 --> 01:08:55.193]  Okay.
[01:08:56.536 --> 01:09:15.685]  The bankers took over in 1913, then the mafia set up a system the bankers liked where they took over Chicago and Illinois, and this is all on record, and they learned to take about 65%, now it's more than 80% and growing, of all the county, city, water district, school district money, and they have a double set of books.
[01:09:15.685 --> 01:09:24.469]  They talk about the budget and put the pensions on the budget and all of that, and then they invest, I mean here in Austin almost all of the bond proposals they pass never get spent on that.
[01:09:25.089 --> 01:09:29.872]  You can look back at stuff Bonds passed 30 years ago, where the money just disappeared.
[01:09:29.872 --> 01:09:31.633]  I mean, it's just organized crime, folks.
[01:09:31.633 --> 01:09:38.538]  It's so huge, people have trouble believing it, because it's so massive.
[01:09:38.538 --> 01:09:42.701]  Then we talk about it, and it's kind of like J. Edgar Hoover said, it's a conspiracy theory before Congress.
[01:09:42.701 --> 01:09:45.142]  LaCosa Nostra, the Mafia, doesn't exist.
[01:09:45.142 --> 01:09:46.943]  Well, they've been telling you the New World Order doesn't exist.
[01:09:46.943 --> 01:09:49.165]  I mean, they talk to us like we're idiots.
[01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:59.779]  And so they've been privatizing, and to sucker police in, about 15 years ago they started paying $180,000 for police officers.
[01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:08.243]  But it was very selective, and it was elite, and, you know, they know how to make it, oh, so cool, like, oh, Hollywood people are getting microchips for their kids, and everybody wants it.
[01:10:08.243 --> 01:10:09.103]  Same thing with police.
[01:10:09.103 --> 01:10:16.067]  Oh, you get $180,000 if you go join, you know, some of these mercenary groups and go overseas.
[01:10:16.067 --> 01:10:18.348]  Well, then, you know, now they've got it down to about $40,000, $50,000.
[01:10:20.109 --> 01:10:22.351]  And they cheat them and don't even pay them.
[01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:40.667]  Now that they've got everybody ready to do this, now that everybody's accepted it, now that the peace officer associations and lobbies and unions didn't challenge it, now they're fully imploding it and they've got Blackwater in California raiding medical marijuana distilleries, dispensaries, excuse me.
[01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:43.231]  They have got them involved.
[01:10:43.231 --> 01:10:54.156]  You'll hear about fugitive manhunts with Blackwater involved and all these private prisons and private youth halls holding the kids and paying off judges to put them in jail for no reason.
[01:10:54.156 --> 01:10:59.339]  And notice that Obama announced, and I'm going to the caller, that in this
[01:11:00.498 --> 01:11:22.805]  Banker takeover bill, and then now in the stimulus, $19 million to federalize all health care regulations, a federal board, all health care records are, without a warrant or anything, are instantly uploaded through the computers by law, and then we pay for it in the taxes, and then they pay for it again in health care going up for the cost of these systems.
[01:11:22.805 --> 01:11:24.226]  All of that is uploaded to the feds.
[01:11:25.362 --> 01:11:41.173]  And they're federalizing the states, they're federalizing police, they're building federal emergency management, threat integration, fusion centers in multi-county areas, and then they go, we've got free office space for your police, we've got free office space, or we're going to deputize you as a federal officer.
[01:11:41.173 --> 01:11:47.677]  And then, oh, the National Guard's going to be here now, and oh, the Army's going to be here now, and oh, the Marines are here to help you run checkpoints.
[01:11:47.677 --> 01:11:51.080]  So this is martial law takeover in slow motion, and yes, this bill
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:12:18.964]  moving its way along through the federal congress openly federalizes all of the colleges in the country and it takes control of the uh... colleges peace officers who had before been chartered under the state and so now i go back to erica a police officer erica go ahead uh... let me throw this out at you to you're asking about drills and and things like that
[01:12:19.594 --> 01:12:26.958]  Now, any peace officer in Texas is going to be able to recognize this because it's mandatory training that we've been having to undergo for about the past two years.
[01:12:26.958 --> 01:12:36.063]  It's the National Incident Management System, which is basically put out, I guess, from Homeland Security after the whole 9-11 deal.
[01:12:36.063 --> 01:12:47.830]  Basically, what it is, it teaches every police officer in the state, and I'm sure it's probably nationwide too, that when the guys with the gold badges, meaning the FBI or whoever, show up, those are now our new bosses.
[01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:52.766]  Okay, in any kind of emergency situation, anything like that.
[01:12:52.766 --> 01:13:04.196]  Well, being one of the instructors in our department, I was told here about three months ago by my lieutenant to expect to begin making returns on all this federal money that our department has been getting.
[01:13:04.196 --> 01:13:08.079]  Okay, and I'm asking him, now what do you mean by this?
[01:13:08.079 --> 01:13:14.225]  His issue was that since we've been taking money from the federal government, they're now starting to expect drills to be run
[01:13:15.874 --> 01:13:24.498]  That they have already pre-organized, they've already pre-set what kind of drills that these are going to be, and start running them in the community that we serve.
[01:13:24.498 --> 01:13:27.920]  Yes, and that'll be lockdown drills.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.581]  You've seen the city of Austin now, there's a shooting.
[01:13:30.581 --> 01:13:37.004]  Even after the shooters have been caught, they'll lock down a large area of Austin and tell people to stay in their homes.
[01:13:37.004 --> 01:13:39.786]  And the officers are compartmentalized, but that's federal funding.
[01:13:40.646 --> 01:13:49.357]  But I don't want officers to not believe me here because this is so insane and most departments haven't done this yet, but it's going on in every major state.
[01:13:49.357 --> 01:13:57.487]  For at least a decade, they pull up at the schools unannounced, they load elementary students with their hands up on buses and take them to a local FEMA center.
[01:13:58.428 --> 01:14:01.170]  Training the children with learned helplessness.
[01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:05.672]  In other cases, they'll blow up a car in the parking lot, scare the middle school students.
[01:14:05.672 --> 01:14:09.355]  And this was in the Associated Press in Michigan, and I've seen it in other states.
[01:14:09.355 --> 01:14:10.115]  You can go pull it up.
[01:14:10.115 --> 01:14:11.276]  This is word for word.
[01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:29.363]  I mean, I'm paraphrasing, but this is what the article said, word for word, that they brought out the middle schoolers in the parking lot, they set off smoke grenades in the bus, and they had police dressed up in camo run up and scream, we're going to kill you and throw fake blood on them.
[01:14:30.123 --> 01:14:42.806]  Terrorizing the students, this is on record, and saying we are from the Homeschoolers Against Public Education group and then they aim guns at the children until they cry and then literally crap themselves was in the story.
[01:14:42.806 --> 01:14:47.547]  Now, I had another lady on from Minneapolis a few years ago with her lawyer.
[01:14:47.547 --> 01:14:50.548]  This was in the Minneapolis, you know, St.
[01:14:50.548 --> 01:14:53.329]  Paul newspaper, The Star.
[01:14:53.329 --> 01:14:57.950]  It said in there that they went in the portable buildings unannounced, the SWAT team under a federally funded drill,
[01:14:59.002 --> 01:15:25.774]  said we're terrorists put your hands up and they walked the teacher of the students out and said we're going to execute you prepare to die and a bunch of the kids defecated urinated the woman had a mental break had to be hospitalized and some of the other teachers had to be hospitalized and so see this is criminal it's the same thing they do but don't believe me pull up the articles please i want people to know this is real i know it sounds insane
[01:15:26.954 --> 01:15:31.761]  Let's see, they started them before that with, oh, we're just going to have a drill when no kids are there taking over the school.
[01:15:31.761 --> 01:15:33.323]  And then, oh, we're going to do it while the kids are there.
[01:15:33.323 --> 01:15:34.926]  And then we're going to do it like this.
[01:15:34.926 --> 01:15:37.389]  And I have film of this going on in places like Belton.
[01:15:38.773 --> 01:15:41.595]  With Army there, telling us to turn our cameras off.
[01:15:41.595 --> 01:15:46.618]  So, if you study Soviet re-education camps, they would do this in a sports stadium.
[01:15:46.618 --> 01:15:50.280]  Beat up certain people, scare folks, have scary movies playing.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.840]  The best example is the movie Red Dawn.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.482]  It's fictitious, but that's exactly how they run.
[01:15:54.482 --> 01:16:05.208]  And it's meant to freak everybody out, break them down, make people go crazy, but also brainwash the cops and to identify which departments will do this type of insane stuff.
[01:16:05.208 --> 01:16:05.468]  Go ahead.
[01:16:06.607 --> 01:16:10.270]  Let me throw this out, and I know you've got a tight schedule with callers.
[01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:14.053]  I just want to throw this out to all my fellow peace officers here in Texas.
[01:16:14.053 --> 01:16:24.241]  You guys had better wake up and remember the oath that you took when you put that badge on to uphold the Constitution of the United States and that of Texas as well.
[01:16:24.241 --> 01:16:32.027]  Because when it comes down to it, when it comes down to it, they're not going to show any more mercy on us than they're going to show anybody else.
[01:16:32.455 --> 01:16:40.000]  Well, let me say this, officer, and we've got time for it, because I'm going to get to Eric and Steven, Randy and others, but it's important when police and military call in.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.201]  Look at history.
[01:16:41.201 --> 01:16:44.083]  Every time tyranny comes to your door, it's in a uniform.
[01:16:44.083 --> 01:16:47.406]  We're not saying that people that want to be police officers are bad.
[01:16:47.406 --> 01:16:56.773]  We're saying corrupt governments use police to carry out their criminal aims, and they are federalizing the police publicly.
[01:16:56.773 --> 01:16:58.214]  And what is the federal government?
[01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:08.117]  It's openly a pack of criminals announcing world government and a new super bank in Time Magazine and Newsweek and the Wall Street Journal that is going to rule America.
[01:17:08.117 --> 01:17:11.218]  I mean, there's no more time for denial is what I'm saying.
[01:17:11.218 --> 01:17:13.519]  This is now in our face.
[01:17:13.519 --> 01:17:15.119]  I agree, absolutely.
[01:17:15.119 --> 01:17:17.820]  Alex, I appreciate what you do.
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:24.602]  Just to give you a little idea of what's going on, we're slowly getting the word out through your videos, at least through our department.
[01:17:24.602 --> 01:17:26.123]  There's a group of us that are doing this.
[01:17:26.707 --> 01:17:29.908]  And I'm hoping it's taking place in other departments across this country.
[01:17:29.908 --> 01:17:33.909]  What percentage of your department do you think are waking up?
[01:17:33.909 --> 01:17:35.529]  It's very small right now.
[01:17:35.529 --> 01:17:36.470]  Very small.
[01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:44.352]  Because it's one of those things, I don't know, when you're a police officer, you get in wrong with the administration, and it's your butt on the line.
[01:17:44.352 --> 01:17:53.074]  You know, Jack McLean, he had a lot of wisdom in what he was saying, becoming the most fired officer in the history of his department, and that can easily happen.
[01:17:53.074 --> 01:17:55.955]  The police chiefs in our country, they are sold out.
[01:17:56.474 --> 01:17:57.954]  I can tell you that right now.
[01:17:57.954 --> 01:17:59.194]  They are sold out.
[01:17:59.194 --> 01:18:04.595]  Now, I say that big city police chiefs and medium sized departments, absolutely.
[01:18:04.595 --> 01:18:07.096]  But the small town police chiefs, I don't know.
[01:18:07.096 --> 01:18:09.916]  Why do you think the Austin police chief keeps cozying up to me?
[01:18:09.916 --> 01:18:13.057]  That's a good question.
[01:18:13.057 --> 01:18:16.617]  I was actually in a training seminar that he was one of the speakers in.
[01:18:16.617 --> 01:18:18.718]  He seemed like a totally likable guy.
[01:18:18.718 --> 01:18:22.218]  You know, I guess, but he came from California.
[01:18:22.218 --> 01:18:25.179]  I think he came from the California Highway Patrol before he came to Austin.
[01:18:25.711 --> 01:18:36.479]  So he's got a very different idea of policing than what I would consider Texas type of policing.
[01:18:36.479 --> 01:18:51.972]  Now once they have the precedent set to make you go to all these federal training things, you know, we've had other emergency managers on and played tapes of interviews with them, where then it turns into mass graves and we've got to fight the American people and we're getting ready for martial law.
[01:18:52.492 --> 01:18:58.756]  That's why when you talk to even National Guard people who are compartmentalized, they go, we're just going door-to-door asking to search people's houses.
[01:18:58.756 --> 01:18:59.997]  It's just for Afghanistan.
[01:18:59.997 --> 01:19:06.201]  But then you hear the commander go, we need to convince the public to trust us, and we're here to learn the local area.
[01:19:06.201 --> 01:19:09.503]  This is for America, folks.
[01:19:09.503 --> 01:19:10.544]  Absolutely.
[01:19:10.544 --> 01:19:13.966]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:19:13.966 --> 01:19:14.587]  I don't know.
[01:19:14.587 --> 01:19:15.827]  I know a lot of military guys.
[01:19:15.827 --> 01:19:20.250]  I've trained with a lot of military guys through our tactics programs and things like that.
[01:19:21.716 --> 01:19:31.585]  One of the big things is the incorporation of military trainers into police training, especially in the area of tactics, firearms, and things like that.
[01:19:31.585 --> 01:19:40.914]  And there's some concern amongst police officer trainers that that is really undermining the sovereignty, the local sovereignty of the community that we serve.
[01:19:40.914 --> 01:19:47.260]  When you have military trainers teaching military tactics, military style rules of engagement, it undermines
[01:19:47.876 --> 01:19:50.558]  It absolutely undermines the local control of the police.
[01:19:50.558 --> 01:19:51.079]  That's right.
[01:19:51.079 --> 01:19:52.239]  Call us back again, officer.
[01:19:52.239 --> 01:19:53.240]  Good to hear from you.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.442]  The military kills people and breaks things.
[01:19:55.442 --> 01:20:01.246]  Peace officers defend the community.
[01:20:01.246 --> 01:20:04.709]  What are you going to do if your family has no food in the event of an emergency?
[01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:06.190]  Do you really want to find out?
[01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:07.932]  And gamble with your family's lives?

[01:20:34.235 --> 01:20:40.260]  Is free enterprise flawed or is our monetary system forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:42.782]  The answers are in Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:42.782 --> 01:20:46.245]  Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about the Fed and central banking.

[01:22:08.988 --> 01:22:12.790]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:15.091]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:15.091 --> 01:22:17.532]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:17.532 --> 01:22:25.616]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[01:23:12.811 --> 01:23:16.772]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[01:23:16.772 --> 01:23:21.393]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.

[01:24:13.687 --> 01:24:15.908]  Welcome.
[01:24:15.908 --> 01:24:16.589]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[01:24:16.589 --> 01:24:17.389]  Can you hear me?
[01:24:17.389 --> 01:24:17.789]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:17.789 --> 01:24:19.290]  All right.
[01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:29.596]  First of all, I'm a DOT TV member and just got my team tyranny response t-shirt, and I love all that stuff, the bumper stickers that came with it.
[01:24:29.596 --> 01:24:30.377]  Thank you.
[01:24:30.377 --> 01:24:33.219]  Thank you for the support, sir.
[01:24:33.219 --> 01:24:38.862]  Well, I really want to touch on something that I think is really serious and bring it back to the forefront, something that you brought up yesterday.
[01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:47.187]  I was actually on hold pacing back and forth trying to bring it up, and then you, sure enough, brought it up about Glenn Beck and others.
[01:24:47.187 --> 01:25:00.076]  And what I'll say is, you know, everybody remembers how faker politicians like Huckabee and others will pretend to stand for things, you know, by mimicking certain rhetoric directly from the mouths of other well-meaning
[01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:06.051]  Yeah, I think it's really dangerous though, because it really just puts everybody's brain into a blender.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.343]  Well, notice he first came on Fox a month ago.
[01:25:19.343 --> 01:25:23.907]  Hardcore, sounded like it was Alex Jones, and already he's gone into New World Order.
[01:25:23.907 --> 01:25:25.248]  He gets your confidence.
[01:25:25.248 --> 01:25:26.349]  Bill O'Reilly.
[01:25:26.349 --> 01:25:29.671]  I used to watch Bill O'Reilly like 10 years ago on Fox.
[01:25:29.671 --> 01:25:31.373]  It was the Illuminati, the New World Order.
[01:25:31.373 --> 01:25:32.474]  He only did it for about a year.
[01:25:32.474 --> 01:25:34.976]  Well, I have a quick comment about it.
[01:25:34.976 --> 01:25:39.760]  I mean, just to bring it to the forefront, because I've been studying him since he went to Fox the last month.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.042]  And, you know, although they're all paid actor idiots and
[01:25:42.557 --> 01:25:51.742]  You know, I think Glenn Beck and other news characters are studying you, like you said, and like these top, you know, radio broadcasters are telling you that your time has come.
[01:25:51.742 --> 01:26:04.089]  You know, I've watched you over the years, over the last ten years, kind of walk through hell and back and really take on this responsibility now where you know how to disseminate this information, and people are looking for this information.
[01:26:04.089 --> 01:26:07.732]  And so you've got a guy like him that spins off their own version of the truth.
[01:26:07.732 --> 01:26:08.972]  Let me be specific.
[01:26:08.972 --> 01:26:09.673]  Beck has...
[01:26:10.972 --> 01:26:15.634]  Beck has our guest, our very guest on, within two days of us having him on.
[01:26:15.634 --> 01:26:17.215]  I've talked to folks at Fox News.
[01:26:17.215 --> 01:26:18.015]  They are listening.
[01:26:18.015 --> 01:26:18.896]  They are watching us.
[01:26:18.896 --> 01:26:20.236]  I've talked to CNN.
[01:26:20.236 --> 01:26:21.337]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:26:21.337 --> 01:26:23.118]  It's actually kind of a scary responsibility.
[01:26:23.118 --> 01:26:26.259]  But yes, their eyes are all on what we're doing.
[01:26:26.259 --> 01:26:27.640]  And we should ask, why is that?
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.900]  Because we're on target.
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:30.301]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:26:30.301 --> 01:26:31.561]  We're completely on target.
[01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:37.144]  I'm trying to give power to all of your listeners in the sense that this is the time in history where we're at the front of the movement.
[01:26:37.677 --> 01:26:49.476]  And if they're going to pay a guy like... I mean, I'm tooting your horn because it is Rupert Murdoch, Government TV, paying him to spin his own version of the truth and spew it at the sheep in order for the networks to seem empathetic enough.
[01:26:49.895 --> 01:26:51.576]  So that people will keep tuning in.
[01:26:51.576 --> 01:26:52.978]  Well, sir, I know this happened.
[01:26:52.978 --> 01:27:09.191]  I've been approached by probably ten different TV networks, and they'll have vice presidents, heads of programming, who want to put it on, they know that's where the audience is, and then people in the ownership level, even above management, will say no.
[01:27:09.191 --> 01:27:12.434]  Well, let me bring it to a crop for you, because this is what I think it is.
[01:27:12.434 --> 01:27:18.759]  If Fox has, for years, been following orders and beating the drums of war for a conflict with Iran,
[01:27:19.437 --> 01:27:19.557]  Yes.
[01:27:19.557 --> 01:27:19.677]  Yes.
[01:27:46.823 --> 01:27:48.403]  Well, that's what Michael Savage does.
[01:27:48.403 --> 01:28:13.008]  He says, I'm fighting the New World Order, and the New World Order is Iran and Iraq, and they really do have WMDs, and now they're saying Iran has WMDs, and I'm no fan of a lot of stuff Iran does, but the point is, the IAEA is there, this is non-weapons grade what they're making, and Israel admitted in Israeli papers last week, we read it on air out of the papers, that they're staging assassinations and bombings to try to destabilize Iran.
[01:28:13.008 --> 01:28:13.728]  That's an act of war!
[01:28:14.749 --> 01:28:16.634]  It's simple to understand.
[01:28:16.634 --> 01:28:22.270]  Any nations that aren't along with their order, that have resources and people that are in their way, they're going to move.
[01:28:24.246 --> 01:28:24.947]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:28:24.947 --> 01:28:27.568]  And, you know, it's scary, folks.
[01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:29.330]  And by scary, I mean the responsibility.
[01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:31.811]  I mean, I've rationalized.
[01:28:31.811 --> 01:28:33.432]  I've told myself I'm not that big.
[01:28:33.432 --> 01:28:35.294]  I've told myself this show isn't that big.
[01:28:35.294 --> 01:28:38.496]  You know, I think of the planet as tiny, as life short.
[01:28:38.496 --> 01:28:39.577]  I'm not on a power trip.
[01:28:39.577 --> 01:28:40.878]  It's the opposite.
[01:28:40.878 --> 01:28:47.002]  And I try to minimize it being about Alex Jones and this show and about being you, the listeners, because that is what the power is.
[01:28:47.002 --> 01:28:52.766]  But more and more, I mean, the executives that call me and the people I talk to and the things I've heard and seen, you know,
[01:28:53.046 --> 01:29:04.094]  They're trying to scramble our brains by putting a guy like Glenn Beck in our face and making us think, of course not your listeners, that he's talking anything near the truth when it's all talking points.
[01:29:04.094 --> 01:29:11.719]  That they want us to believe certain aspects of their compartmentalized issues that they'll feed us.
[01:29:11.719 --> 01:29:16.362]  People need to really stand up against it and make a big issue about it because it's only been there for a month.
[01:29:16.362 --> 01:29:16.782]  I hear you.
[01:29:16.782 --> 01:29:17.843]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:17.843 --> 01:29:21.986]  You know, I've been watching a lot more television lately to analyze things and I
[01:29:23.502 --> 01:29:24.042]  It's clear.
[01:29:24.042 --> 01:29:28.124]  The door, as Webster Tarpley said, to false flag stage terror is open.
[01:29:28.124 --> 01:29:31.265]  They need that because their agenda is already stalling.
[01:29:31.265 --> 01:29:36.307]  They may not have staged more terror if they could get their agenda through without doing it than just financial terrorism.
[01:29:36.307 --> 01:29:38.388]  You'll give us all the power or the banks will close.
[01:29:39.502 --> 01:29:41.844]  But I do think they're going to stage a big terror attack.
[01:29:41.844 --> 01:29:45.588]  And it does look like Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to attack Iran.
[01:29:45.588 --> 01:29:50.233]  And just God help us, because this is going to hurt everybody in Iran, in Israel, in the United States.
[01:29:50.233 --> 01:29:51.795]  This is good for nobody.
[01:29:51.795 --> 01:29:53.196]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.196 --> 01:29:55.739]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.739 --> 01:30:01.544]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.544 --> 01:30:02.025]  You worry.
[01:30:02.426 --> 01:30:04.487]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:30:04.487 --> 01:30:07.129]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:09.251]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:30:09.251 --> 01:30:10.872]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:14.454]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:30:14.454 --> 01:30:19.697]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:30:19.697 --> 01:30:23.680]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.361]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:30:25.361 --> 01:30:28.263]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:30:28.263 --> 01:30:31.205]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:30:31.707 --> 01:30:40.354]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:30:40.354 --> 01:30:45.177]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:30:45.177 --> 01:30:49.200]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:53.223]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:30:53.223 --> 01:30:54.604]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:30:54.604 --> 01:30:56.326]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:31:01.201 --> 01:31:07.964]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:07.964 --> 01:31:10.605]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:10.605 --> 01:31:12.145]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:12.145 --> 01:31:12.946]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:12.946 --> 01:31:13.886]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:13.886 --> 01:31:15.227]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:15.227 --> 01:31:17.308]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:17.308 --> 01:31:24.450]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:24.450 --> 01:31:24.951]  Some U.S.
[01:31:24.951 --> 01:31:30.573]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:31.273 --> 01:31:34.756]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:34.756 --> 01:31:36.778]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:01.793 --> 01:32:07.297]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:32:07.297 --> 01:32:08.098]  and the world.
[01:32:08.098 --> 01:32:11.961]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:32:11.961 --> 01:32:18.466]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:20.487]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:32:20.487 --> 01:32:28.433]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:32:28.713 --> 01:32:29.294]  We're good to go.
[01:32:43.993 --> 01:32:45.073]  Free of charge.
[01:32:45.073 --> 01:32:45.414]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[01:32:45.414 --> 01:32:45.494]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:32:45.494 --> 01:32:47.034]  Or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[01:32:47.034 --> 01:32:49.175]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:32:49.175 --> 01:32:49.535]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:33:20.051 --> 01:33:23.093]  We are continuing with Open Phones.
[01:33:23.093 --> 01:33:39.844]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, top constitutional law scholar, won several times at the Supreme Court level, will be joining us to talk about the massive states' rights movement exploding, countering the globalist takeover through the federal government of the states, and how not just the states, but the counties, the cities, are also taking action.
[01:33:39.844 --> 01:33:40.664]  So that's coming up.
[01:33:40.664 --> 01:33:43.026]  Also, I want to play later the trailer.
[01:33:43.826 --> 01:33:48.338]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv, but also the audio for radio listeners of the new G.I.
[01:33:48.338 --> 01:33:50.404]  Joe movie, The Rise of Cobra.
[01:33:51.657 --> 01:33:58.203]  Because you talk about Pentagon brainwashing, all of it is Pentagon brainwashing, so we'll go over that.
[01:33:58.203 --> 01:34:04.489]  You're going to be this superhuman in a nanotech bodysuit jumping over buildings if you join the U.S.
[01:34:04.489 --> 01:34:05.289]  Army.
[01:34:05.289 --> 01:34:16.960]  No, they're going to shoot you up full of deadly vaccines and cheat you out of any of your health care and treat you like absolute filth and rob your charities, and that was all in the news yesterday, and not pay you the bonuses they promise.
[01:34:18.255 --> 01:34:20.517]  I mean, this is not our military anymore, folks.
[01:34:20.517 --> 01:34:22.398]  There's a lot of good men and women in the military.
[01:34:22.398 --> 01:34:28.341]  Some people continue to support it, but you support them by having them come home and defend the Republic.
[01:34:28.341 --> 01:34:34.285]  Before I go to Magnus and Walker and many others that are patiently holding, Walker's calling from China.
[01:34:34.285 --> 01:34:35.626]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:35.626 --> 01:34:36.727]  Also, Rod in Illinois and others.
[01:34:41.514 --> 01:34:46.396]  I want to remind listeners that the Obama Deception is basically done.
[01:34:46.396 --> 01:34:56.121]  I'm just mastering the audio and adding the music and smoothing it, sweetening it a bit, and then it will go off to be manufactured next week.
[01:34:56.121 --> 01:35:00.943]  That'll take about a week and then we'll be here in the office and they ship out on March 15th.
[01:35:00.943 --> 01:35:09.527]  You can order the Obama Deception at InfoWars.com and those that order pre-order will be the first to get it because we're going to
[01:35:10.407 --> 01:35:15.090]  Ship the orders out, package the orders out, and ship them out in the order that they are received.
[01:35:15.090 --> 01:35:20.154]  So, be first to get the Obama Deception, powerful new film that is nearing completion.
[01:35:20.154 --> 01:35:25.238]  We're going to have some sneak peeks in the next week that are going to be released, sections of the film and things on the web.
[01:35:25.238 --> 01:35:29.401]  But right now, let's go ahead and let you hear the trailer for the Obama Deception.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:44.503]  On March 15th, a carefully crafted corporate fraud will be exposed.
[01:35:44.503 --> 01:35:48.244]  And a vicious hoax will be revealed to the people of the world.
[01:35:48.244 --> 01:35:54.146]  Contrary to the rumors that you've heard, I was not born in a manger.
[01:35:54.146 --> 01:36:00.909]  I was actually born on Krypton and sent here to save the planet Earth.
[01:36:04.338 --> 01:36:13.122]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[01:36:13.122 --> 01:36:17.183]  Everybody somewhere between the ages of 18-25 will serve three months of basic training.
[01:36:17.183 --> 01:36:23.066]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong.
[01:36:23.066 --> 01:36:23.826]  Yes we can!
[01:36:26.078 --> 01:36:29.500]  Obama's health care plan will include coverage of all essential medical services.
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.021]  Yes, we can!
[01:36:31.021 --> 01:36:32.923]  Obama is a cruel hoax.
[01:36:32.923 --> 01:36:34.143]  He works for Wall Street.
[01:36:34.143 --> 01:36:36.545]  He's an agent of finance capital.
[01:36:36.545 --> 01:36:39.507]  Where did you come up with the number $700 billion?
[01:36:39.507 --> 01:36:42.109]  Here's the Treasury spokeswoman's quote.
[01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:44.130]  It's not based on any particular data point.
[01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:46.892]  We just really wanted to come up with a really big number.
[01:36:46.892 --> 01:36:49.874]  To Democrats and Republicans who've opposed this plan,
[01:36:50.931 --> 01:36:53.413]  I say, step up to the plate.
[01:36:53.413 --> 01:36:59.558]  A few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[01:36:59.558 --> 01:37:03.500]  Secretary Henry Paulson is no George Washington.
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:11.747]  I don't think anyone questions, Mr. Kashkari, that you're working hard.
[01:37:11.747 --> 01:37:14.569]  Our question is who you're working for.
[01:37:18.342 --> 01:37:26.207]  Obama pledged that he would resume the Security and Prosperity Partnership talks between Mexico and Canada that President Bush initiated.
[01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:28.588]  The old boss is starting to look a lot like the new boss.
[01:37:28.588 --> 01:37:33.210]  Robert Gates is going to remain on the job as Defense Secretary for at least a year.
[01:37:33.210 --> 01:37:40.895]  Plenty of sources knew about this meeting, told us and others that it was at Hillary Clinton's house, but clearly it wasn't.
[01:37:43.257 --> 01:37:49.541]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:37:49.541 --> 01:37:55.465]  We see you causing a depression so you can blow out the economy and consolidate it and bankrupt it.
[01:37:55.465 --> 01:38:01.389]  We know that you are enemies of free humanity and we are here standing against your tyranny!
[01:38:09.184 --> 01:38:11.185]  The Obama Deception.
[01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:17.849]  On March 15th, the people strike back.
[01:38:17.849 --> 01:38:23.612]  Infowar, and the film is coming to the Infowar March 15th for presentplanet.tv members in super high quality.
[01:38:23.612 --> 01:38:25.033]  I want you to burn it to disc or DVD.
[01:38:25.033 --> 01:38:26.234]  Give it out to everybody you know.
[01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:30.356]  And the highest quality will be on the DVDs.
[01:38:30.356 --> 01:38:33.718]  And everybody needs to have one of the DVDs in their library.
[01:38:33.718 --> 01:38:35.079]  And please buy DVD burners.
[01:38:35.879 --> 01:38:48.142]  Blank DVDs and go absolutely crazy with these on the streets, because they're riding their whole agenda through on the back of their juggernaut, Barack Obama, and the juggernaut is already slowing.
[01:38:48.142 --> 01:38:53.084]  So InfoWars.com or toll free number to call and order the film, The Obama Deception.
[01:38:54.445 --> 01:38:58.070]  We're talking less than 20 days now until this ship's out, so get your orders in now, folks.
[01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:59.352]  That'll go by in the blink of an eye.
[01:38:59.352 --> 01:39:02.797]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or InfoWars.com, or see it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:02.797 --> 01:39:03.097]  You can
[01:39:11.949 --> 01:39:20.276]  Of course, also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:39:20.276 --> 01:39:27.583]  And it's $19.95 for the write-at-100-minute film, plus several extras that are very important.
[01:39:27.583 --> 01:39:28.744]  Actually, parts of the film.
[01:39:28.744 --> 01:39:31.606]  We just want the film to be shorter, so it's heavily produced, good extras.
[01:39:33.007 --> 01:39:42.033]  And you can get them as low as $9.95 or even lower than that when you order the film in bulk at theobamadeception.net or infowars.com.
[01:39:42.033 --> 01:39:44.915]  Okay, let's go back to your calls.
[01:39:44.915 --> 01:39:46.956]  Rod in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:39:46.956 --> 01:39:51.239]  Hello?
[01:39:51.239 --> 01:39:52.360]  Yes, yes, Rob.
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:53.521]  Oh, excellent.
[01:39:53.521 --> 01:39:55.642]  Alright, well, Alex, I just want to thank you for everything you do.
[01:39:55.642 --> 01:39:56.783]  I've been a longtime supporter.
[01:39:57.438 --> 01:40:06.065]  And I'd like to give a quick shout-out to my affiliates at the Codeine University, K-O-D-E-I-N-E, university.blogspot.com.
[01:40:06.065 --> 01:40:08.508]  Just my own little personal thing to try and help the movement.
[01:40:08.508 --> 01:40:09.609]  Good.
[01:40:09.609 --> 01:40:14.753]  But I wanted to call today and talk to you about the nationalization of banks that I've been hearing about all over CNN.
[01:40:14.753 --> 01:40:18.496]  Yeah, it's not really nationalization, go ahead.
[01:40:18.496 --> 01:40:22.219]  Oh, well, I'm not certain specifically, that's why I was actually hoping to get some more input from you.
[01:40:23.717 --> 01:40:31.062]  But what I was wondering is, is usually when I hear the word nationalization, I'm thinking of governments taking over private industries, and that's usually the issue.
[01:40:31.062 --> 01:40:42.170]  But with this, it almost seems like they're going to try and use it as a reverse usurp of the government, where the banking cartels will actually basically inject themselves into our government.
[01:40:42.170 --> 01:40:44.532]  And I was just wondering what you, what your thoughts on that were?
[01:40:45.103 --> 01:41:03.517]  Well, I'm going to play a clip coming up in the next segment, I'm glad you reminded me, where the Federal Reserve Security Force, which are private police officers, but accredited police officers, mercenaries, the lady walks over to a guy on the sidewalk, not even on their property, and I've stood right there in D.C.
[01:41:03.517 --> 01:41:13.644]  and shot footage myself, and she walks over, but that was on a weekend so they didn't come out, and they tell a large news outlet that does a lot of work online
[01:41:14.565 --> 01:41:16.146]  Turn your camera off.
[01:41:16.146 --> 01:41:17.707]  And the guy says, well, I'm allowed to.
[01:41:17.707 --> 01:41:19.288]  Of course, he doesn't ask what the law is.
[01:41:19.288 --> 01:41:23.891]  In Aaron Russo's Freedom to Fascism, the same goons come over and say, you can't videotape.
[01:41:23.891 --> 01:41:29.134]  And everywhere I went in D.C., everywhere I went, you would try to film the White House.
[01:41:29.134 --> 01:41:30.935]  They'd come over and say, you can't film the White House.
[01:41:30.935 --> 01:41:32.496]  And I would be on the sidewalk.
[01:41:32.496 --> 01:41:33.897]  And I'd say, excuse me, this is America.
[01:41:33.897 --> 01:41:35.278]  And they'd say, you can't.
[01:41:35.278 --> 01:41:36.639]  And I would go to the Washington Monument.
[01:41:36.639 --> 01:41:37.799]  And they'd say, you can't film it.
[01:41:37.799 --> 01:41:39.680]  And I'd say, yes, I can, First Amendment.
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:40.821]  They'd go, you've got to get a permit.
[01:41:40.821 --> 01:41:41.582]  And I said, you know what?
[01:41:42.282 --> 01:41:48.428]  We checked, because we're here with an independent film channel crew, they checked, because they want to follow the rules.
[01:41:48.428 --> 01:41:51.091]  Permits are not issued unless you're inside buildings.
[01:41:51.091 --> 01:41:56.276]  And I said, and they would start getting threatening, we even have footage of this, I ought to put it out on the web, and I'd say, you know what?
[01:41:58.656 --> 01:42:01.399]  If you falsely arrest me, I'm going to be forced to sue you.
[01:42:01.399 --> 01:42:02.179]  This is America.
[01:42:02.179 --> 01:42:04.621]  You've got cameras surveilling us everywhere.
[01:42:04.621 --> 01:42:08.104]  And it didn't matter if I was out on the street filming the Supreme Court.
[01:42:08.104 --> 01:42:12.708]  It didn't matter if I was out on the street filming the Library of Congress.
[01:42:12.708 --> 01:42:14.690]  It didn't matter what building I was filming.
[01:42:14.690 --> 01:42:18.814]  It didn't matter if we were at Arlington Cemetery.
[01:42:18.814 --> 01:42:21.636]  On the side of the road, they'd come over and say, stop.
[01:42:21.636 --> 01:42:23.337]  And these are thugs.
[01:42:23.337 --> 01:42:24.398]  This is a sick joke.
[01:42:25.865 --> 01:42:27.406]  I mean, this is worse than Mexico City.
[01:42:27.406 --> 01:42:30.028]  They don't stop you from filming in Mexico City.
[01:42:30.028 --> 01:42:31.329]  There is no law.
[01:42:31.329 --> 01:42:35.552]  And here you have this private Federal Reserve cop saying, we're a Federal Reserve.
[01:42:35.552 --> 01:42:36.412]  We're the Federal Government.
[01:42:36.412 --> 01:42:38.454]  You can't film the Federal Government.
[01:42:38.454 --> 01:42:39.374]  It's the law.
[01:42:39.374 --> 01:42:41.416]  There is no law.
[01:42:41.416 --> 01:42:42.156]  And that's the whole thing.
[01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:43.697]  They should become the Federal Government.
[01:42:43.697 --> 01:42:46.219]  I thought they were a private insurance company.
[01:42:46.219 --> 01:42:47.380]  Well, yes.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:48.480]  They have never been.
[01:42:49.764 --> 01:43:08.524]  Part of the federal government since they took over in 1913, and they ordered the Treasury around, but in the Banker Bailout Bill, they were given above government power, above Congress, no agency, no police group can even start an investigation of them, that's the subsection, and so when you hear privatization, when you hear U.S.
[01:43:08.524 --> 01:43:10.226]  taxpayer money is going to buy 40% positions,
[01:43:12.308 --> 01:43:12.568]  I don't
[01:43:29.819 --> 01:43:47.794]  So it's not privatization, it is a hijacking, it is a pirate gang, it is a takeover, it is color of law, it is openly the District of Columbia Private Corporation, set up after the Civil War, fully being taken over in a corporate takeover.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:51.302]  Of what's left of the government.
[01:43:51.302 --> 01:43:54.885]  And so, the federal government's taken over by private banks.
[01:43:54.885 --> 01:43:58.248]  That's why they're federalizing the states, because that's not even federalization.
[01:43:58.248 --> 01:44:02.652]  That's private mercenary takeover of everything.
[01:44:02.652 --> 01:44:04.714]  And so, yes, this is not a privatization.
[01:44:04.714 --> 01:44:10.298]  This is the Federal Reserve openly becoming government, because it is going to be the regional governorship
[01:44:11.179 --> 01:44:22.269]  Of the world government, according to every major news report, again, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times of London, AP, Agency, French Press, Reuters, Time Magazine, Wall Street.
[01:44:22.269 --> 01:44:23.050]  It's all out there.
[01:44:23.050 --> 01:44:24.251]  I've been reading them on air.
[01:44:24.251 --> 01:44:31.938]  A, quote, bank of the world that will control every government of the world, control the currencies, control the interest rates, selectively.
[01:44:31.938 --> 01:44:36.022]  They'll play that off against nations to further consolidate power and vertically integrate.
[01:44:36.682 --> 01:44:41.266]  And the United States will be ruled through the regional governorship of the Federal Reserve.
[01:44:41.266 --> 01:44:50.613]  And so, this is absolute, total, mass crime takeover in front of everyone with the nice, pretty pitch man, Barack Obama.
[01:44:50.613 --> 01:44:50.993]  Pitching.
[01:44:50.993 --> 01:44:52.814]  Right, so these surfings have already been taking place.
[01:44:52.814 --> 01:44:55.116]  They're just actually flexing the muscle now, is what you're saying?
[01:44:55.515 --> 01:44:58.896]  Well, they're going completely public with it.
[01:44:58.896 --> 01:45:03.597]  They have the control, it's just now they're letting everybody know.
[01:45:03.597 --> 01:45:14.120]  Yes, but now that's why they've had former and current Fed governors who've even been cut out of the loop at the regional banks telling Bloomberg and AP, quote, war powers have been declared, we're not even part of it now.
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:19.748]  This is full, total foreign domination, just like the banks dominate third world countries.
[01:45:19.748 --> 01:45:26.037]  This is full, complete occupation by a paramilitary force, openly owned by private banks.
[01:45:27.535 --> 01:45:30.998]  I know you're busy, man, so I'm going to let you go here.
[01:45:30.998 --> 01:45:41.147]  I just wanted to say thank you again, and again, shout out codeineuniversity.blogspot.com, and you should check out the Kid Rock Warrior video that's up there with the three-door-down video.
[01:45:41.147 --> 01:45:41.748]  I think you'll find it.
[01:45:41.748 --> 01:45:42.809]  Oh, yeah, Kid Rock.
[01:45:42.809 --> 01:45:46.192]  Yeah, yeah, pull up Kid Rock Warrior video.
[01:45:46.192 --> 01:45:49.715]  Look for Kid Rock's Kid Rock Warrior, The Real National Guard.
[01:45:49.715 --> 01:45:51.196]  That's a video that I produced myself.
[01:45:51.917 --> 01:45:52.478]  Alex, can you hear me?
[01:45:52.478 --> 01:45:52.878]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:45:52.878 --> 01:45:57.664]  I have a two-part, complex kind of question for you, but before I ask it, I just wanted to say thank you.
[01:46:10.357 --> 01:46:15.780]  For everything you've done, you're a real American, a real patriot, and I thank you for everything you've done.
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:18.521]  Well, thank you, sir, but I'm just trying to survive and have liberty.
[01:46:18.521 --> 01:46:24.664]  I have no future if we don't beat these people, neither do you, so I'm not doing anything that's not my duty and not sane.
[01:46:24.664 --> 01:46:31.128]  It is sane to not let criminal, eugenics-obsessed bankers fully rule us.
[01:46:31.128 --> 01:46:31.828]  Absolutely.
[01:46:31.828 --> 01:46:33.249]  It is the only course.
[01:46:35.161 --> 01:47:02.931]  My question for you, it's a two-part little thing, but I was wondering if you were any familiar with or had any desire to do any work with Milton Cooper, the guy that was killed in Arizona, and he had a radio show called Hour of the Time, and he dealt with a lot of the Patriot issues that you deal with, but he also dealt with UFO-type stuff, and I was curious what your thoughts were on him, and also I wanted to know,
[01:47:03.909 --> 01:47:10.232]  What role, if any, should UFOs play in the Patriot movement?
[01:47:10.232 --> 01:47:11.913]  And that's kind of my question.
[01:47:11.913 --> 01:47:13.214]  Your thoughts on Cooper?
[01:47:13.214 --> 01:47:14.394]  Alright, I appreciate the call.
[01:47:14.394 --> 01:47:17.756]  Let me briefly try to answer that.
[01:47:17.756 --> 01:47:20.237]  All I deal with is what I can prove.
[01:47:20.237 --> 01:47:32.843]  And from declassified and leaked government documents, and talking to Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head of Star Wars, also another incarnation, Colonel Bob Bowman, he can only tell me what had been leaked by accident
[01:47:34.241 --> 01:47:37.302]  And I went and checked what he told me back during the 9-11 symposium in L.A.
[01:47:37.302 --> 01:47:45.245]  when we had a lunch privately for an hour, because I was really prying him for, you know, anything he could tell me that didn't violate national security letters he'd sign.
[01:47:45.245 --> 01:47:49.466]  And he told me what I already knew.
[01:47:49.466 --> 01:47:57.269]  By the late 70s, they had over a hundred drone robot aircraft, space planes,
[01:47:59.304 --> 01:48:02.685]  I mean, all the technologies around having a human survive in these.
[01:48:02.685 --> 01:48:04.746]  Well, it's very easy to launch them without that.
[01:48:04.746 --> 01:48:09.987]  They have DU solid round meteor gun weapons.
[01:48:09.987 --> 01:48:16.329]  They fire the hundred pound or larger and they carry a lot of these depleted uranium with an incredible mass.
[01:48:16.329 --> 01:48:18.870]  It goes through the gravity well and accelerates to over 30,000 miles an hour.
[01:48:20.410 --> 01:48:27.358]  And as the equivalent of a medium-sized nuclear weapon, it will destroy underground bases a mile under.
[01:48:27.358 --> 01:48:32.565]  And you can't build bases a mile under anyways because there's too much pressure, the heat goes up to over 130 degrees.
[01:48:34.448 --> 01:48:37.909]  So the deepest bases, you know, can only be about a half mile down generally.
[01:48:37.909 --> 01:48:41.970]  They have some supposedly deeper that are especially air-conditioned, but that's a side issue.
[01:48:41.970 --> 01:48:49.512]  And this is a decapitation weapon to be able to take over the whole planet basically instantly, where they can just kill the leadership of the world if they want in a matter of minutes.
[01:48:49.512 --> 01:48:57.294]  In the 70's they had the decapitation drones orbiting the planet, and they've got big platforms, most of the space programs secret.
[01:48:58.735 --> 01:48:59.575]  They've got this up there.
[01:48:59.575 --> 01:49:02.876]  So I talk about things like that.
[01:49:02.876 --> 01:49:03.956]  I'm not the grand poobah.
[01:49:03.956 --> 01:49:05.697]  I don't decide what has a place.
[01:49:05.697 --> 01:49:07.918]  I don't decide what can be discussed.
[01:49:07.918 --> 01:49:10.058]  I don't tell people what they should talk about.
[01:49:10.058 --> 01:49:13.359]  I don't get into little green men and all the rest of this.
[01:49:13.359 --> 01:49:15.180]  I'm not saying some of that isn't going on.
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:16.620]  I don't know.
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:22.041]  I can't get folks to admit they're building FEMA camps and gun confiscation drills when it's in the mainstream news.
[01:49:22.041 --> 01:49:23.562]  On the subject of Bill Cooper,
[01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:32.414]  I woke up, you know, from more of the John Birch Society type angle and reading history books.
[01:49:32.414 --> 01:49:42.961]  And I literally hadn't read Behold a Pale Horse till like 96, 97 and I couldn't get through it because it was all about submarine flying saucers and you know all this stuff and I just thought that was kooky.
[01:49:42.961 --> 01:49:46.424]  I was more like a mainline Ron Paul type guy.
[01:49:46.424 --> 01:49:48.745]  And then Mr. Cooper was in trouble with the IRS.
[01:49:48.745 --> 01:49:49.686]  He put out a call for help.
[01:49:49.686 --> 01:49:50.387]  I tried to get him help.
[01:49:51.843 --> 01:49:56.947]  He was very, very argumentative and angry when I even had him on the phone, as he was to everybody else.
[01:49:56.947 --> 01:49:58.488]  And then he kept using profanity.
[01:49:58.488 --> 01:50:00.830]  I was having to delay him out on the radio.
[01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:02.631]  And then I let him go early on the show.
[01:50:02.631 --> 01:50:07.034]  People go, we heard that show, we don't hear the cussing, because I delayed it out, folks.
[01:50:07.034 --> 01:50:11.377]  The station had a great delay, 15 seconds.
[01:50:11.377 --> 01:50:19.463]  And, you know, then the network put me on at night and he freaked out and thought that I was going up against him and started saying that I wore, this is a quote,
[01:50:22.603 --> 01:50:24.364]  Ruby nipple rings.
[01:50:24.364 --> 01:50:25.284]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:50:25.284 --> 01:50:28.745]  The lies were just so vicious and so horrible.
[01:50:28.745 --> 01:50:32.867]  And then even when they killed him, I said it was terrible and looked like a setup.
[01:50:32.867 --> 01:50:36.868]  And I've tried to say nice things about him, even though he did all those horrible things to me.
[01:50:36.868 --> 01:50:42.070]  And the people demand that I come into it and get into it.
[01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:46.291]  And they're the ones that won't let the dead rest or use his material for whatever they want.
[01:50:46.291 --> 01:50:49.112]  So I'm not going to get into a fight or anything with Bill Cooper.
[01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:56.271]  I mean, you know, anybody that knew him just knew he was, he was just out of his mind.
[01:50:56.271 --> 01:51:01.993]  I mean, screaming, cussing at people, just constantly.
[01:51:01.993 --> 01:51:06.054]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[01:51:06.054 --> 01:51:07.955]  You are not alone.
[01:51:07.955 --> 01:51:10.816]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[01:51:10.816 --> 01:51:15.877]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[01:51:15.877 --> 01:51:17.618]  Signs include itching, pulling,
[01:51:17.978 --> 01:51:18.519]  I don't know.
[01:51:38.081 --> 01:51:38.881]  On September 11th, 2001, along with
[01:52:04.625 --> 01:52:07.148]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:52:07.148 --> 01:52:08.469]  And we knew what to do.
[01:52:08.469 --> 01:52:10.472]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:52:10.472 --> 01:52:17.499]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:17.499 --> 01:52:26.029]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:26.414 --> 01:52:33.500]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:36.683]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:36.683 --> 01:52:42.447]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:42.447 --> 01:52:45.530]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:53:21.150 --> 01:53:31.713]  Order the Discreet Pepper Mace Baton, which relies on a powerful pepper formula that upon direct contact with an attacker's eyes, forces them to slam shut, causing an intense burning sensation.
[01:53:31.713 --> 01:53:34.814]  This refillable unit is designed to be carried as a key ring.
[01:53:34.814 --> 01:53:35.714]  Easily accessible
[01:53:35.894 --> 01:53:36.535]  We're good to go.
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:18.781]  You know, this is not a sporting event, this radio show.
[01:54:18.781 --> 01:54:21.442]  This is not a play or entertainment.
[01:54:21.442 --> 01:54:23.683]  This is about saving the republic.
[01:54:23.683 --> 01:54:26.704]  This is about getting people to wake up and say no to the globalists.
[01:54:26.704 --> 01:54:31.046]  I mean, I saw five news articles this morning
[01:54:32.146 --> 01:54:36.489]  About more poison food from China, more poison food in the U.S.
[01:54:36.489 --> 01:54:46.634]  Lead, mercury, you know, more than, now it's more than half of the corn syrup products have high levels of mercury made here in the U.S.
[01:54:46.634 --> 01:54:49.796]  There's no reason that should be there, it's not in the manufacturing process.
[01:54:51.348 --> 01:54:52.169]  I mean, we're dying.
[01:54:52.169 --> 01:54:52.929]  This is eugenics.
[01:54:52.929 --> 01:54:55.190]  This is being done on purpose.
[01:54:55.190 --> 01:55:07.978]  I got more mainstream articles yesterday where they admit that millions and millions of ampoules of Factor VIII were shipped out to hemophiliacs and others that had HIV and hepatitis and every shot that killed them, deader than a hammer, and others are still dying.
[01:55:09.128 --> 01:55:11.189]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:13.990]  And meanwhile, people are all, what about this patriot?
[01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:15.271]  What about that patriot?
[01:55:15.271 --> 01:55:16.892]  I like this host, I like that host.
[01:55:16.892 --> 01:55:18.172]  We don't have time.
[01:55:18.172 --> 01:55:19.413]  Things are collapsing.
[01:55:19.413 --> 01:55:21.534]  We're going into a controlled depression.
[01:55:21.534 --> 01:55:22.854]  Troops are standing by.
[01:55:22.854 --> 01:55:26.356]  Mexico is collapsing.
[01:55:26.356 --> 01:55:28.037]  We gotta be adults here, folks.
[01:55:29.198 --> 01:55:39.702]  I've tried to take the high road on so many issues, and as we get bigger and bigger and reach more people, you know, more and more folks just get jealous who are kind of in the old guard movement, and they need to stop that.
[01:55:39.702 --> 01:55:42.403]  We need to pull together against the globalists.
[01:55:42.403 --> 01:55:44.104]  We don't have time to screw around.
[01:55:44.104 --> 01:55:56.889]  Speaking of tyranny, here's the audio from the video that's up on PrisonPlanet.com of the Federal Reserve telling a great news outlet, I've seen the work they've done, turn your camera off, all color of law, all fraud, just completely made up,
[01:55:57.629 --> 01:56:01.776]  Uh, just, just, just telling the slave he can't stay on the sidewalk and videotape.
[01:56:01.776 --> 01:56:02.897]  Here it is.
[01:56:02.897 --> 01:56:03.739]  What's that?
[01:56:03.739 --> 01:56:06.563]  You need to go through public affairs.
[01:56:06.563 --> 01:56:08.726]  No, I was just getting some security shots.
[01:56:08.726 --> 01:56:11.290]  No, you need to go through public affairs for you to videotape or take pictures.
[01:56:11.290 --> 01:56:12.131]  Of any federal building?
[01:56:12.131 --> 01:56:13.033]  Of any federal building.
[01:56:14.324 --> 01:56:16.365]  Because I was just at the Academy of Sciences.
[01:56:16.365 --> 01:56:16.885]  I don't care.
[01:56:16.885 --> 01:56:19.185]  This is kind of reserved.
[01:56:19.185 --> 01:56:20.766]  You take pictures or videotapes.
[01:56:20.766 --> 01:56:23.106]  You just have to call Public Affairs.
[01:56:23.106 --> 01:56:23.766]  They set it up.
[01:56:23.766 --> 01:56:25.187]  You have a meeting.
[01:56:25.187 --> 01:56:26.747]  They tell you what time to come out and take pictures.
[01:56:26.747 --> 01:56:27.768]  You take pictures all day long.
[01:56:27.768 --> 01:56:30.128]  So I can't stand on the public sidewalk and take pictures?
[01:56:30.128 --> 01:56:33.229]  You can go across the street if you like, but they're still going to come over there and ask you questions.
[01:56:33.229 --> 01:56:36.090]  You can stay too long.
[01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:38.130]  So where am I allowed to shoot from?
[01:56:38.130 --> 01:56:40.771]  Really, you can't take pictures of a federal building.
[01:56:40.771 --> 01:56:41.111]  Period.
[01:56:42.105 --> 01:56:44.886]  If I was a tourist, I could just take a picture of the Capitol?
[01:56:44.886 --> 01:56:48.707]  If you was a tourist and you went by and you snapped a picture, they're not going to snatch your camera.
[01:56:48.707 --> 01:56:52.208]  But if you come up with something like that, they're going to approach you and they're going to ask you what you're doing.
[01:56:52.208 --> 01:56:53.629]  Stop right there!
[01:56:53.629 --> 01:57:01.031]  You know, we're going to start the live feed at PrisonPlanet.tv in about four minutes, so why not just play this clip with video then?
[01:57:01.031 --> 01:57:09.534]  But, in fact, I want to get this reporter on, and I want to talk about this with Dr. Edwin Vieira coming up.
[01:57:10.905 --> 01:57:14.468]  Because he's a constitutional law scholar, won at the Supreme Court multiple times.
[01:57:14.468 --> 01:57:17.270]  I mean, this is so un-American, so illegal.
[01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:25.457]  She walks up to city property and tells him, you notice she doesn't go off the property line, she's behind a little fence, and says, you just get out of here.
[01:57:25.457 --> 01:57:27.079]  See, that's the essence of tyranny.
[01:57:27.079 --> 01:57:31.983]  And if they practice that tyranny on you, and you put up with it, you become a slave.
[01:57:33.049 --> 01:57:34.150]  This is a federal building.
[01:57:34.150 --> 01:57:35.851]  You can't videotape any federal building.
[01:57:35.851 --> 01:57:39.633]  Hey, lady, it's a private offshore bank destroying America.
[01:57:39.633 --> 01:57:44.055]  And you're destroying America by coming up and... And this happened to me everywhere in D.C.
[01:57:44.055 --> 01:57:49.058]  and I had to refuse and say no, and they'd call supervisors, and then they'd just walk off.
[01:57:49.058 --> 01:57:52.200]  In some cases, though, they said, we're gonna go ahead and have you arrested.
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.681]  Come to me.
[01:57:53.681 --> 01:57:54.581]  And that was at the...
[01:57:56.075 --> 01:58:01.725]  That was at the Library of Congress, and I'm standing on the sidewalk, and I said, no, I'm not coming on your jurisdiction.
[01:58:01.725 --> 01:58:04.210]  Nice try, and boy, they had their tasers ready.
[01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:07.957]  They were going to light me up for not licking their boots up one side and down the other.
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:11.822]  They were ready to light me up!
[01:58:11.822 --> 01:58:17.809]  Imagine, I'm standing on the sidewalk filming all the occultic stuff that's all for a future film.
[01:58:17.809 --> 01:58:20.051]  I multitask when I go to an event.
[01:58:20.051 --> 01:58:26.078]  I was covering Bilderberg, but I multitask for the Obama film, the JFK film, and an occult film that I'm working on.
[01:58:26.078 --> 01:58:28.600]  And they just come running out and said, you can't film.
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:29.581]  And I said, yeah, I can.
[01:58:30.262 --> 01:58:34.203]  And I happen to know all the, you know, even the legalese they have in D.C.
[01:58:34.203 --> 01:58:35.143]  And then you said, come here.
[01:58:35.143 --> 01:58:35.763]  Come, come to me.
[01:58:35.763 --> 01:58:39.064]  And I said, you're not going to light me up, terrorist.
[01:58:39.064 --> 01:58:42.785]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:42.785 --> 01:58:46.206]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.956 --> 01:58:57.703]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.703 --> 01:59:00.667]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.667 --> 01:59:03.711]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.711 --> 01:59:08.418]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.638 --> 01:59:09.758]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.758 --> 01:59:13.020]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:20.003]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:20.003 --> 01:59:23.284]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:42.262]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.965 --> 01:59:56.367]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.367 --> 02:00:05.714]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.714 --> 02:00:07.015]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.015 --> 02:00:08.796]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.796 --> 02:00:10.537]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.537 --> 02:00:12.118]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.118 --> 02:00:13.700]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:17.863]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.863 --> 02:00:21.946]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.609 --> 02:00:25.791]  We're good to go.
[02:00:42.125 --> 02:00:44.427]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[02:00:44.427 --> 02:00:45.688]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:00:45.688 --> 02:00:49.911]  We are simulcasting now for the next two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:49.911 --> 02:00:56.296]  Dr. Edwin Villera, constitutional law scholar and attorney, will be joining us to talk about the state's rights movement exploding.
[02:00:56.296 --> 02:01:01.119]  We now have Alabama and several other states moving to say any new federal gun laws are unconstitutional.
[02:01:01.119 --> 02:01:02.360]  We're not following them.
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:03.481]  No gun confiscation.
[02:01:03.481 --> 02:01:06.503]  Montana, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas.
[02:01:07.384 --> 02:01:13.973]  We've got a state senator from Texas making national headlines about putting state forces on the border as Mexico collapses.
[02:01:13.973 --> 02:01:15.955]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[02:01:15.955 --> 02:01:24.786]  A little bit later, I'm going to play this clip that's up on PrisonPlanet.com, and that clip deals
[02:01:26.431 --> 02:01:38.763]  With the fact that the Federal Reserve minions walk over to a camera person and tell them that they aren't allowed to videotape a local camera crew.
[02:01:38.763 --> 02:01:41.105]  In fact, we have that clip now.
[02:01:41.105 --> 02:01:45.009]  Let's go ahead and cut over here to this shot.
[02:01:45.009 --> 02:01:50.134]  And then we're going to go ahead and go to this video for folks.
[02:01:50.134 --> 02:01:50.795]  So here it is.
[02:01:55.051 --> 02:02:00.595]  Right here, live on Prison Planet dot TV.
[02:02:00.595 --> 02:02:07.479]  What's up?
[02:02:07.479 --> 02:02:11.282]  Did you go through public affairs?
[02:02:11.282 --> 02:02:12.863]  No, I was just getting some security shots.
[02:02:12.863 --> 02:02:16.426]  No, you need to go through public affairs for you to videotape or take pictures.
[02:02:16.426 --> 02:02:17.366]  Of any federal building?
[02:02:17.366 --> 02:02:18.287]  Of any federal building.
[02:02:19.605 --> 02:02:19.905]  Stop!
[02:02:19.905 --> 02:02:20.105]  Stop!
[02:02:20.105 --> 02:02:20.265]  Stop!
[02:02:20.265 --> 02:02:20.445]  Stop!
[02:02:20.445 --> 02:02:20.725]  Stop!
[02:02:20.725 --> 02:02:23.266]  I mean this is so incredible in America to see this.
[02:02:49.795 --> 02:02:52.096]  You can even go across the street, but we'll still come over there.
[02:02:52.096 --> 02:02:57.677]  There's no law, and she says, you know, we may snatch your camera, like a third world country.
[02:02:57.677 --> 02:02:58.298]  Snatch you!
[02:02:58.298 --> 02:03:00.718]  And I had this happen to me all over D.C.
[02:03:00.718 --> 02:03:03.639]  and I'd say, look, there's no law and you know it.
[02:03:03.639 --> 02:03:07.020]  And the larger issue of what they do is
[02:03:11.567 --> 02:03:15.849]  Tell you then to come sign up with them, and then they just don't answer your calls or don't return calls.
[02:03:15.849 --> 02:03:20.812]  Because Seethink, a film production company for Independent Film Channel, was following us around when we were in D.C.
[02:03:20.812 --> 02:03:24.754]  last year, and they had tried to get permits.
[02:03:24.754 --> 02:03:27.115]  There's no permits issued.
[02:03:27.115 --> 02:03:29.737]  Permits are only for inside the buildings, because it's a First Amendment issue.
[02:03:29.737 --> 02:03:31.078]  It's been litigated.
[02:03:31.078 --> 02:03:32.218]  But they don't care.
[02:03:32.218 --> 02:03:36.961]  They still come out, and they still enforce this on everyone.
[02:03:38.424 --> 02:03:41.607]  And you've got to ask yourselves why, because they're setting the precedent.
[02:03:41.607 --> 02:03:46.050]  This is just like a third world country, or Soviet Russia, or Nazi Germany.
[02:03:46.050 --> 02:03:48.832]  And the public has been trained like cowards to just do what they say.
[02:03:48.832 --> 02:03:55.098]  Let's go ahead and go back to the clip.
[02:03:55.098 --> 02:04:04.125]  The picture, they're not going to snatch your camera, but if you come up with something like that, they're going to approach you and they're going to ask you what you're doing, they're going to ask you for ID, all that good stuff.
[02:04:04.125 --> 02:04:05.106]  Okay?
[02:04:05.106 --> 02:04:06.467]  What if I was wearing like a press badge?
[02:04:07.153 --> 02:04:10.100]  Now, if you did that, they're going to ask you, who's your contact person?
[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:12.966]  Because then you should have contacted Public Affairs.
[02:04:12.966 --> 02:04:13.487]  The Fed?
[02:04:13.487 --> 02:04:14.069]  Public Affairs?
[02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:15.953]  Or just like... Public Affairs for the Federal Reserve.
[02:04:16.656 --> 02:04:19.477]  So, for every building I need to contact that public affairs person?
[02:04:19.477 --> 02:04:20.077]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:20.077 --> 02:04:20.277]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:20.277 --> 02:04:21.838]  Even just to shoot from the public sidewalk?
[02:04:21.838 --> 02:04:23.078]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:23.078 --> 02:04:23.899]  I did not know that.
[02:04:23.899 --> 02:04:25.099]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:25.099 --> 02:04:25.939]  Is that new?
[02:04:25.939 --> 02:04:27.740]  No, it's always been like that.
[02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:30.921]  Now, there's tourists that come through here, snap a picture, and keep on going.
[02:04:30.921 --> 02:04:32.222]  Yeah, and usually don't bother you?
[02:04:32.222 --> 02:04:34.663]  No, as long as they take a picture and keep on going.
[02:04:34.663 --> 02:04:38.104]  But when you come up with a video camera like that, that's when we come out and get you.
[02:04:38.104 --> 02:04:42.265]  Because I've shot like tons of buildings, and you're the first person to ever approach me.
[02:04:42.265 --> 02:04:43.506]  They probably never paid attention to you.
[02:04:46.130 --> 02:04:49.734]  Edwin Vieira coming up and get his take on it.
[02:04:49.734 --> 02:04:51.716]  But this is us being slaves.
[02:04:51.716 --> 02:04:54.820]  She's talking to this guy like he's a bad two-year-old child.
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:56.582]  How dare you in America videotape this?

[02:08:02.668 --> 02:08:09.294]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.294 --> 02:08:12.277]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.591 --> 02:08:23.238]  Dr. Edwin Vieira has a long bio, has won cases as a constitutional attorney before the Supreme Court and other major courts.
[02:08:23.238 --> 02:08:29.603]  He is a staunch defender of the Second Amendment and of constitutional money.
[02:08:29.603 --> 02:08:35.408]  And we've got him here to cover a host of issues today for the next 51 minutes that we have left in this hour.
[02:08:38.686 --> 02:08:49.329]  But, sir, just for those who have just joined us for the first time or may not know who you are, briefly, for listeners, what's most important for folks to know about yourself?
[02:08:49.329 --> 02:08:58.592]  Well, that I have been studying problems of constitutional law for more than 30 years now, focusing to a very large degree on monetary matters.
[02:08:58.592 --> 02:09:06.475]  And then, let me say, in the last, oh, probably 10 years total, looking into questions of
[02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:13.812]  The Constitutional Militia, and then more specifically after 9-11, the whole area of what's called Homeland Security.
[02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:25.576]  And then the intersection of those two matters, which when you study it, Alex, it really tends to bring in or sweep in all of the basic principles of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
[02:09:25.576 --> 02:09:37.079]  They're intimately tied in to those areas because I like to tell people, you look at money and the militia or that whole Homeland Security problem, one of the two fundamental powers of government that you're talking about.
[02:09:37.577 --> 02:09:50.924]  The power of the purse and the power of the sword, which anyone who is well-versed in political philosophy realizes historically have always been considered to be the premier powers of government, of any kind of government.
[02:09:50.924 --> 02:09:56.627]  Well, you are accredited as being in the top ten constitutional law scholars out there, so you can speak to all these issues.
[02:09:56.627 --> 02:10:01.469]  I want to get into the now upwards of 30 with Alabama declaring a pro-Second Amendment
[02:10:03.297 --> 02:10:04.298]  Bill that's been introduced.
[02:10:04.298 --> 02:10:13.603]  States are passing these bills saying no to the feds, bringing up the martial law, bringing up the gun confiscation plans, bringing up the presidential decision directives.
[02:10:13.603 --> 02:10:18.246]  Very exciting to see the state reps and state senators informed on what's going on.
[02:10:18.246 --> 02:10:20.367]  We have one joining us next hour.
[02:10:20.367 --> 02:10:23.749]  But before we do that, before you joined us, I played a clip of a
[02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:33.711]  online news agency videotaping from the sidewalk the Federal Reserve in DC which I've done myself the private Federal Reserve and the Federal
[02:10:35.586 --> 02:10:40.249]  Reserve minion who's not a federal police officer comes over and says, you can't film across the street.
[02:10:40.249 --> 02:10:41.870]  You know, we'll come harass you there.
[02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:43.171]  You can't film here.
[02:10:43.171 --> 02:10:44.512]  You've got to get permission from us.
[02:10:44.512 --> 02:10:52.257]  Well, I just so happen to know that a film crew tried to get permission to film out front the Federal Reserve when they told them that from the Independent Film Channel, and they were told no.
[02:10:52.257 --> 02:10:55.259]  So they're turning a right into a privilege.
[02:10:55.259 --> 02:11:00.943]  I want to play you a clip of this, this audio, and then get your response to what you hear.
[02:11:00.943 --> 02:11:05.026]  This is during the confrontation where he's standing at the fence.
[02:11:05.986 --> 02:11:12.310]  And she's behind it, you know, telling him that he can't be there filming.
[02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:14.131]  Here's a little bit of that.
[02:11:14.131 --> 02:11:22.415]  They're not going to snatch your camera, but if you come up with something like that, they're going to approach you and they're going to ask you what you're doing, they're going to ask you for ID, all that good stuff.
[02:11:22.415 --> 02:11:23.396]  Okay?
[02:11:23.396 --> 02:11:25.437]  What if I was wearing, like, a press badge?
[02:11:25.437 --> 02:11:30.080]  Now, if you did that, they're going to ask you who's your contact person, because then you should have contacted Public Affairs.
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:31.761]  Um, the Fed?
[02:11:31.761 --> 02:11:32.321]  Public Affairs?
[02:11:32.321 --> 02:11:34.942]  Or just like... Public Affairs for the Federal Reserve.
[02:11:34.942 --> 02:11:37.764]  So, for every building I need to contact that public affairs person?
[02:11:37.764 --> 02:11:38.364]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:38.364 --> 02:11:38.604]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:38.604 --> 02:11:40.125]  Even just to shoot for the public sidewalk?
[02:11:40.125 --> 02:11:41.365]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:41.365 --> 02:11:42.186]  I did not know that.
[02:11:42.186 --> 02:11:43.186]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:43.186 --> 02:11:44.247]  Uh, is that new?
[02:11:44.247 --> 02:11:46.028]  No, it's always been like that.
[02:11:46.028 --> 02:11:49.229]  Now, there's tourists that come through here, snap a picture, and keep on going.
[02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:50.510]  Yeah, and usually don't bother?
[02:11:50.510 --> 02:11:52.951]  No, as long as they take a picture and keep on going.
[02:11:52.951 --> 02:11:56.293]  But when you come up with a video camera like that, that's when we come out and get you.
[02:11:57.056 --> 02:12:00.558]  Because I've shot like tons of billions and you're the first person to ever approach me.
[02:12:00.558 --> 02:12:02.819]  They probably never paid attention to you.
[02:12:02.819 --> 02:12:05.700]  But this is the Federal Reserve.
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:06.300]  Okay?
[02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:06.941]  Is that bigger?
[02:12:08.129 --> 02:12:09.210]  What do you mean?
[02:12:09.210 --> 02:12:11.971]  You don't know what the Federal Reserve is?
[02:12:11.971 --> 02:12:13.632]  Okay, who do you work for?
[02:12:13.632 --> 02:12:14.692]  The American News Project.
[02:12:14.692 --> 02:12:18.114]  What I mean is, like, I've shot the White House and the Capitol building.
[02:12:18.114 --> 02:12:18.995]  And they never approached you?
[02:12:18.995 --> 02:12:19.355]  No.
[02:12:19.355 --> 02:12:21.416]  I can't even see them being popular.
[02:12:21.416 --> 02:12:22.596]  Or the Treasury Building.
[02:12:22.596 --> 02:12:24.237]  You know, standing there where all the public walks?
[02:12:24.237 --> 02:12:25.438]  Just standing right there on the sidewalk.
[02:12:25.438 --> 02:12:26.258]  I've taken pictures.
[02:12:26.258 --> 02:12:27.859]  You know, just getting some B-roll digs here.
[02:12:27.859 --> 02:12:35.183]  I've never had anybody... But now, in order for you to take pictures of this building, or any kind of videotape, you have to go through Public Affairs.
[02:12:35.183 --> 02:12:35.803]  Huh.
[02:12:35.803 --> 02:12:36.663]  Okay.
[02:12:36.663 --> 02:12:37.604]  Alright, uh...
[02:12:39.198 --> 02:12:41.082]  So I can't just shoot some shots here?
[02:12:41.082 --> 02:12:42.466]  No sir.
[02:12:42.466 --> 02:12:43.769]  Alright.
[02:12:43.769 --> 02:12:45.112]  And what about the shots that I've already shot?
[02:12:45.112 --> 02:12:46.375]  Can I use those?
[02:12:46.375 --> 02:12:48.500]  I have nothing to do with what you've done shot already.
[02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:49.241]  Right.
[02:12:49.241 --> 02:12:49.462]  Okay.
[02:12:51.190 --> 02:12:52.511]  Okay.
[02:12:52.511 --> 02:12:54.793]  Is there like up security here at the Federal Reserve?
[02:12:54.793 --> 02:12:55.253]  Is it up?
[02:12:55.253 --> 02:12:56.714]  No, it's always been like this.
[02:12:56.714 --> 02:12:58.836]  Alright, stop right there.
[02:12:58.836 --> 02:12:59.737]  This is classic.
[02:12:59.737 --> 02:13:08.644]  It's not just feds and federal security guards at the Supreme Court and everywhere else I've been coming across the street or the White House or the Washington Monument saying you can't film it.
[02:13:09.344 --> 02:13:10.045]  You can't film it.
[02:13:10.045 --> 02:13:11.267]  And I said, go ahead and arrest me.
[02:13:11.267 --> 02:13:12.609]  You know it's a color of law and a fraud.
[02:13:12.609 --> 02:13:13.651]  I'm gonna have to sue you.
[02:13:13.651 --> 02:13:14.872]  And they back off.
[02:13:14.872 --> 02:13:16.234]  They know they're making this up.
[02:13:16.234 --> 02:13:24.186]  They've been told to go out and create this legalese and try to create some type of common law precedence to just have us as slaves.
[02:13:24.887 --> 02:13:28.108]  Well, I'm not exactly sure what the motivation is, although I think it's probably a sinister one.
[02:13:56.263 --> 02:14:07.672]  Also, I've seen instances where this type of argument has been made about taking photographs of police engaged in activities on a public street and arrests and so forth.
[02:14:07.672 --> 02:14:23.384]  Primarily, I suppose they're concerned about being sued for police brutality, but nonetheless, I cannot imagine the constitutional justification for saying that someone standing on a public sidewalk cannot take a photograph of any building
[02:14:24.284 --> 02:14:26.084]  Within Washington, D.C.
[02:14:26.084 --> 02:14:27.145]  I mean, any building.
[02:14:27.145 --> 02:14:30.525]  What's funny about this is I put out a book several years ago called Crashmaker.
[02:14:30.525 --> 02:14:35.486]  It's a semi-fictionalized novel of a collapse of the Federal Reserve System.
[02:14:35.486 --> 02:14:44.888]  And on the cover of that book is a stylized drawing of the Federal Reserve, the old Federal Reserve building on Constitution Avenue.
[02:14:44.888 --> 02:14:50.909]  And that was taken from a photograph, or a number of photographs that I took, actually on their plaza.
[02:14:51.957 --> 02:14:52.457]  We're good to go.
[02:15:15.563 --> 02:15:17.144]  Shoot it from a public street?
[02:15:17.144 --> 02:15:23.146]  Well, her capacity is a Federal Reserve police officer in a literal Storm Trooper outfit with a gold buckle.
[02:15:23.146 --> 02:15:30.628]  I mean, it's the closest uniform I've seen people wearing that's the closest to a Nazi uniform I've ever seen.
[02:15:30.628 --> 02:15:38.311]  Well, then she's some kind of private security officer because the Federal Reserve System obviously is not a governmental entity.
[02:15:38.311 --> 02:15:39.371]  Board of Governors might be.
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:43.061]  A governmental board, but not the rest of the Federal Reserve System.
[02:15:43.061 --> 02:15:44.281]  It's all very peculiar.
[02:15:44.281 --> 02:15:48.583]  But it's something... Aaron Russo went into this problem many years ago.
[02:15:48.583 --> 02:15:50.203]  I wasn't with him, but it was described to me.
[02:15:50.203 --> 02:15:53.364]  He was down shooting the IRS building.
[02:15:53.364 --> 02:15:54.925]  Video camera.
[02:15:54.925 --> 02:15:59.426]  And they came out and told him he couldn't do that, and I believe he walked across the street.
[02:15:59.426 --> 02:16:01.987]  And he was shooting from across the street, and he had a confrontation.
[02:16:01.987 --> 02:16:05.528]  Some of the DC police actually showed up.
[02:16:06.855 --> 02:16:08.936]  And confronted him and said, this couldn't be done.
[02:16:08.936 --> 02:16:11.358]  And he said, show me the law and backed him off.
[02:16:11.358 --> 02:16:22.784]  Yeah, well that's right, but obviously they have some... I mean, there may be some legitimate concern lurking in the background that the people who are taking these photographs are attempting to find some vulnerability in the bill.
[02:16:22.784 --> 02:16:24.725]  No, it's ridiculous though.
[02:16:24.725 --> 02:16:26.186]  They're surveilling us.
[02:16:27.226 --> 02:16:38.715]  But I mean, they're surveilling us everywhere with cameras, and then they just passed a law in England that if you videotape or photograph police, you're going to be charged with terrorism at the officer's discretion.
[02:16:38.715 --> 02:16:40.576]  I mean, this is like the Soviet Union.
[02:16:40.576 --> 02:16:41.237]  Well, that's right.
[02:16:41.237 --> 02:16:45.020]  And I think that this whole business has a positive and a negative sense.
[02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:50.063]  They want you to get used to their cameras and their constant surveillance.
[02:16:50.063 --> 02:16:54.687]  And on the other hand, they want you not to be recording what they are doing.
[02:16:55.962 --> 02:17:09.026]  Because that, of course, is what turns up in evidence in civil rights cases, and police brutality cases, and perhaps criminal cases, in which someone is charged with something, and the videotaping of the event shows that exactly the opposite happened.
[02:17:09.026 --> 02:17:25.011]  Yeah, they're definitely scared of cameras, and we saw when they murdered that guy execution-style in the Bay Area, shooting him in the back, they confiscated two cameras, two phone cameras, they said that the cameras, the government cameras, malfunctioned, but then people in a train
[02:17:25.931 --> 02:17:27.514]  And that's the only reason for it.
[02:17:27.514 --> 02:17:28.035]  Let's face the fact.
[02:17:40.330 --> 02:17:57.837]  The only possible reason, leaving aside the mystical theory that a terrorist would use some videotape of the IRS building to commit an act of terrorism, the only reason for this is to be able to cover up official misconduct.
[02:17:57.837 --> 02:18:00.918]  And boss the people around and train us to be slaves.
[02:18:00.918 --> 02:18:02.719]  Well that's the other side, watching you.
[02:18:02.719 --> 02:18:06.000]  But I mean in terms of photographing them, the only reason
[02:18:06.890 --> 02:18:08.270]  Is to cover up official misconduct.
[02:18:26.448 --> 02:18:27.449]  Telling them what, Alex?
[02:18:27.449 --> 02:18:28.749]  Telling them you can't photograph.
[02:18:28.749 --> 02:18:39.796]  We would be in the grass, across the street, on the other side from the White House, and we had White House police come over and tell us we can't film.
[02:18:39.796 --> 02:18:42.898]  And I'd say, I said, this is the First Amendment.
[02:18:42.898 --> 02:18:44.299]  Oh, let me have your press pass.
[02:18:44.299 --> 02:18:46.420]  I go, buddy, you know it's the First Amendment.
[02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:48.021]  And I said, do what you gotta do.
[02:18:48.021 --> 02:18:51.123]  So then they had Secret Service follow us around all day in D.C.
[02:18:51.123 --> 02:18:53.505]  because we dare not get down and just start licking the boots.
[02:18:55.379 --> 02:18:59.041]  Which tends to suggest that they had nothing better to do with the Secret Service.
[02:18:59.041 --> 02:19:04.885]  Why aren't they out searching for those terrorists lurking in the back alleys of D.C.?
[02:19:04.885 --> 02:19:08.347]  Well, we know now that... They don't have time to harass the average person!
[02:19:08.347 --> 02:19:10.608]  What does that tell you about the war on terror?
[02:19:10.608 --> 02:19:17.292]  What does that tell you about their attitude and how bankrupt the government is and how thuggish it is?
[02:19:17.292 --> 02:19:18.933]  Well, I think we know that already.
[02:19:18.933 --> 02:19:23.136]  But, I mean, I'm just looking at the excuse that they give us for all this thuggishness.
[02:19:24.187 --> 02:19:26.549]  And what are they spending their time doing?
[02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:29.771]  Are you talking about harassing tourists at the Lincoln Memorial?
[02:19:29.771 --> 02:19:30.892]  It's unbelievable, sir.
[02:19:30.892 --> 02:19:35.755]  They just... Boss, you'll have like a sidewalk by a park with a family eating ice cream cones.
[02:19:35.755 --> 02:19:37.496]  And the police go, you can't block the sidewalk.
[02:19:37.496 --> 02:19:38.216]  Move along!
[02:19:38.216 --> 02:19:38.737]  Move along!
[02:19:38.737 --> 02:19:41.679]  And the father's like... And then they all grovel and the police go...
[02:19:43.279 --> 02:19:45.822]  They got private security guards doing it.
[02:19:45.822 --> 02:19:47.464]  You couldn't believe it.
[02:19:47.464 --> 02:19:50.248]  And it was just off the charts.
[02:19:50.248 --> 02:19:50.908]  Stay there, sir.
[02:19:50.908 --> 02:19:55.494]  I want to come back and get into the state's rights movement, which you've been pushing for for a long time.
[02:19:55.494 --> 02:19:56.796]  Dr. Edwin Vieira is our guest.
[02:19:56.796 --> 02:19:57.236]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.668 --> 02:20:06.230]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.

[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:08.323]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:08.323 --> 02:21:10.004]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:10.959 --> 02:21:12.500]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:13.300]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:14.301]  This is his M.O.
[02:21:14.301 --> 02:21:15.662]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:15.662 --> 02:21:17.663]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:17.663 --> 02:21:24.807]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:24.807 --> 02:21:25.287]  Some U.S.
[02:21:25.287 --> 02:21:30.951]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:31.631 --> 02:21:35.514]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:35.514 --> 02:21:45.621]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:21:45.621 --> 02:21:46.842]  Fabled enemies.

[02:21:54.607 --> 02:21:57.970]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:22:03.283 --> 02:22:04.684]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:04.684 --> 02:22:10.730]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:11.551]  That's right.
[02:22:11.551 --> 02:22:14.393]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:22:14.393 --> 02:22:21.900]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:22:21.900 --> 02:22:27.545]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs.
[02:22:28.038 --> 02:22:30.019]  Yeah, no word about IRAs.
[02:22:30.019 --> 02:22:35.503]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:22:35.503 --> 02:22:41.306]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:41.306 --> 02:22:45.409]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[02:22:46.096 --> 02:22:47.578]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:22:47.578 --> 02:22:47.798]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.798 --> 02:22:48.078]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[02:23:54.351 --> 02:23:54.972]  Come, you masters of war.
[02:23:54.972 --> 02:23:55.773]  Here to build the big guns.
[02:24:12.185 --> 02:24:13.226]  We are back live.
[02:24:13.226 --> 02:24:15.628]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:24:15.628 --> 02:24:17.049]  Dr. Edwin Vieira is our guest.
[02:24:17.049 --> 02:24:18.871]  We'll give you his website before he leaves us.
[02:24:18.871 --> 02:24:22.033]  Okay, let's get right into upwards of 30 states now.
[02:24:22.033 --> 02:24:25.076]  And we've got an Alabama representative coming on in the next few days.
[02:24:25.076 --> 02:24:27.338]  We've got a state senator from Texas coming on.
[02:24:27.338 --> 02:24:31.281]  Multiple bills in Texas, including telling the feds, hey, you're not protecting the borders.
[02:24:31.281 --> 02:24:32.242]  The state's going to do it.
[02:24:33.122 --> 02:24:36.383]  The states, as you know, but the listeners may not, created the federal government.
[02:24:36.383 --> 02:24:39.324]  It's now been globalized, so it's illegitimate.
[02:24:39.324 --> 02:24:44.726]  You've been pushing for this for a long time, but not just the states, at the county, city level, these committees of safety.
[02:24:44.726 --> 02:24:53.208]  Break down your view and your take, and are you buoyed by the fact that we see a massive states' rights movement going on right now, Doctor?
[02:24:53.208 --> 02:25:01.251]  Well, what's encouraging about it, number one, is that obviously the educational process has worked at the legislative level.
[02:25:01.972 --> 02:25:05.794]  It's state legislators who are pushing this now for the first time.
[02:25:05.794 --> 02:25:20.784]  I mean, you know, you've been pushing it, I've been pushing it, private citizens have been out there attempting to convince these folks that the state's position in the constitutional system has to be reinvigorated, if you will, and reinforced, or enforced, really.
[02:25:20.784 --> 02:25:26.207]  And now they're beginning to pick up on this, of course, it's the economic circumstances that are doing it, but whatever the reason it's happening.
[02:25:26.867 --> 02:25:36.111]  Uh, the next step is for that to be fleshed out in terms of, uh, to what particular problems of greatest immediate importance, uh, does state sovereignty extend?
[02:25:36.111 --> 02:25:42.533]  You mentioned one of them, obviously, in places like Texas and Arizona, you have, and New Mexico, you have the illegal immigration problem.
[02:25:42.533 --> 02:25:49.316]  Uh, but there are a number of these, uh, what I would call homeland security, local homeland security problems that they have to deal with.
[02:25:49.316 --> 02:25:50.136]  And then thirdly,
[02:25:51.593 --> 02:25:53.094]  And this is, of course, a sequential matter.
[02:25:53.094 --> 02:25:58.298]  It's not going to come in the same resolution or the same statute that starts the process.
[02:25:58.298 --> 02:26:05.844]  There has to be consideration given to how state sovereignty is going to be enforced.
[02:26:05.844 --> 02:26:14.450]  It's not enough to tell those people in Washington that the states have constitutional authority, that the states are sick and tired of the
[02:26:15.754 --> 02:26:24.241]  General government in Washington interfering with that unconstitutionally and imposing its own attempted control from states and localities.
[02:26:24.241 --> 02:26:39.913]  But there has to be a mechanism for enforcing this limitation on the general government, number one, and essentially making these reserved state powers function again.
[02:26:39.913 --> 02:26:42.835]  And all I would tell people is, well, the Constitution tells us what the answer to that is.
[02:26:43.908 --> 02:26:48.371]  Second Amendment, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[02:26:48.371 --> 02:26:50.913]  And ultimately that's what the Tenth Amendment is looking towards.
[02:26:50.913 --> 02:26:54.636]  A free state, a state with certain kinds of reserved powers.
[02:26:54.636 --> 02:26:58.298]  Powers to the state itself, while powers to the people.
[02:26:58.298 --> 02:26:59.579]  And that's what we've been getting away from.
[02:26:59.579 --> 02:27:01.661]  Now we have to go back to basic principles.
[02:27:01.661 --> 02:27:05.864]  And that basic principle ultimately is that each state has to pass the necessary legislation
[02:27:06.525 --> 02:27:32.738]  To revitalize its malicious structure and bring every adult male and female citizen of that state into that structure in one way or another to make it absolutely clear to those people in Washington that we do not need their interference, we do not want their interference, and they would, I would suspect, look at that kind of a structure and be highly deterred from attempting to push that interference too far.
[02:27:35.711 --> 02:27:39.253]  You know, a lot of people say, oh, this doesn't have a chance.
[02:27:39.253 --> 02:27:39.954]  What can we do?
[02:27:39.954 --> 02:27:45.597]  They have a loser mentality and don't understand it was five percent of the population started and won the Revolutionary War.
[02:27:45.597 --> 02:27:47.679]  You're an expert on that as well.
[02:27:47.679 --> 02:28:00.807]  And that this, we have a great chance if we believe in it and point out how bankrupt and unconstitutional the federal government's activities are right now as they federalize the state police, as they federalize local governments, as they federalize with bills, the
[02:28:02.508 --> 02:28:03.429]  Universities now.
[02:28:03.429 --> 02:28:06.530]  I mean, the Feds are openly taking over.
[02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:14.132]  It is the duty, not just the right, under the Declaration of Independence and the 10th and 9th Amendment, for us to say no and rectify this.
[02:28:14.132 --> 02:28:20.415]  I mean, Time Magazine and Newsweek are openly announcing a new Bank of the World will rule the United States and set all our policies.
[02:28:20.415 --> 02:28:21.835]  We must do this.
[02:28:21.835 --> 02:28:25.476]  We've got 30 states passing or preparing to pass bills.
[02:28:25.476 --> 02:28:28.358]  We need to then put pressure to have those enforced.
[02:28:28.358 --> 02:28:29.418]  Can you speak to the fact that
[02:28:30.969 --> 02:28:32.650]  We can win this thing!
[02:28:32.650 --> 02:28:33.491]  Well, of course we can.
[02:28:33.491 --> 02:28:38.094]  There's no way that some bank of the world can force us to use its currency.
[02:28:38.094 --> 02:28:38.914]  That's an absurdity.
[02:28:38.914 --> 02:28:40.075]  We have to accede to that.
[02:28:40.075 --> 02:28:41.056]  We have to accept it.
[02:28:41.056 --> 02:28:42.096]  We have to go along with it.
[02:28:42.096 --> 02:28:43.097]  We have to surrender to them.
[02:28:43.897 --> 02:28:47.918]  The fact of the matter is, we are the vast majority of people in this country.
[02:28:47.918 --> 02:28:55.901]  The other side has a very small number, and the people on that side, probably a large number of them, would change sides in any kind of crisis situation.
[02:28:55.901 --> 02:28:59.582]  They're not ideologically wed to that Leviathan in Washington.
[02:28:59.582 --> 02:29:07.524]  Secondly, we are the people in actual possession of the property and the resources of this country, as well as the ability to exercise, you know, intelligence.
[02:29:07.524 --> 02:29:09.945]  We're the ones who run the machines.
[02:29:09.945 --> 02:29:12.086]  We're the ones that make the society function.
[02:29:13.100 --> 02:29:18.508]  So if the vast majority is in possession of the real resources, why are we so worried about them?
[02:29:18.508 --> 02:29:21.473]  They have a lot of paper, and we can repudiate that paper.
[02:29:21.473 --> 02:29:23.777]  Most of it was generated unconstitutionally anyway.
[02:29:23.777 --> 02:29:26.482]  I think we can definitely win this because, A,
[02:29:28.095 --> 02:29:35.921]  We are the majority, and B, we have direct control, I hope still, over our state legislative process.
[02:29:35.921 --> 02:29:37.782]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, we've got a break.
[02:29:37.782 --> 02:29:38.803]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:38.803 --> 02:29:41.665]  Let's continue breaking this down on the other side.
[02:29:41.665 --> 02:29:46.808]  Then I'm going to get into Pentagon, brainwashing, and movies and TV for the young people, and a lot more.
[02:29:46.808 --> 02:29:51.792]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.792 --> 02:29:53.173]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.173 --> 02:29:54.674]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.683 --> 02:30:01.769]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.769 --> 02:30:05.213]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:30:05.213 --> 02:30:09.477]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:30:09.477 --> 02:30:17.445]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[02:30:17.705 --> 02:30:18.145]  We're good to go!
[02:30:50.706 --> 02:30:56.388]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:30:56.388 --> 02:30:59.889]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:30:59.889 --> 02:31:03.530]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:31:03.530 --> 02:31:08.291]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:31:08.291 --> 02:31:11.592]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:31:11.592 --> 02:31:14.473]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:31:14.473 --> 02:31:18.354]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFO?
[02:31:27.757 --> 02:31:32.626]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:31:36.411 --> 02:31:38.872]  How dare you!
[02:31:38.872 --> 02:31:43.935]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:31:43.935 --> 02:31:46.596]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:31:46.596 --> 02:31:53.300]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:31:58.402 --> 02:32:03.285]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:32:03.285 --> 02:32:05.226]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[02:32:05.854 --> 02:32:08.922]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[02:32:08.922 --> 02:32:13.094]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[02:32:13.843 --> 02:32:15.964]  You know that you need to prepare.
[02:32:15.964 --> 02:32:19.345]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[02:32:19.345 --> 02:32:22.666]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[02:32:22.666 --> 02:32:34.450]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:32:34.450 --> 02:32:37.831]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass,
[02:32:38.351 --> 02:32:38.852]  I think so.
[02:33:08.243 --> 02:33:10.026]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:10.026 --> 02:33:13.130]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:33:13.130 --> 02:33:19.939]  We're going to be going back to Dr. Edward Vieira, constitutional law scholar and attorney, here in just a moment.
[02:33:20.979 --> 02:33:28.086]  Before we go back to him, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors, very important sponsors that I believe in that make this radio show possible.
[02:33:28.086 --> 02:33:31.029]  One of them is SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:33:31.029 --> 02:33:33.071]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:33:33.071 --> 02:33:39.757]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[02:33:39.757 --> 02:33:42.320]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims for example, when seeds
[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:42.820]  I think?
[02:34:13.041 --> 02:34:15.343]  Crisis Gardening and Save Your Seeds.
[02:34:15.343 --> 02:34:17.885]  SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[02:34:17.885 --> 02:34:19.346]  And from the same excellent sponsor,
[02:34:29.975 --> 02:34:30.956]  Uh, solutions from science.
[02:34:30.956 --> 02:34:34.017]  We also have mysolarbackup.com.
[02:34:34.017 --> 02:34:38.940]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power in this great system, the solar power generator system.
[02:34:38.940 --> 02:34:43.422]  This is designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[02:34:43.422 --> 02:34:49.946]  You get the emergency power backup kit, which consists of the power source, 1,800, power plant, high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:34:50.766 --> 02:34:55.831]  And again, the website is mysolarbackup.com, mysolarbackup.com, or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, mysolarbackup.com, great system.
[02:34:55.831 --> 02:34:58.513]  Okay, going back to Dr. Edwin Vieira, let's continue with the states.
[02:35:09.704 --> 02:35:19.247]  For those that don't know, maybe you should talk about the history, how the states created a compact to create the federal government, their right to abolish it, or remove it, or amend it.
[02:35:19.247 --> 02:35:26.410]  Instead, we have the feds openly training local police, openly setting all the standards, openly taking over, and the feds themselves
[02:35:27.250 --> 02:35:34.292]  As if, you know, the federal government wasn't bad enough, are now openly controlled by foreign banks, openly signing away Congress's authority.
[02:35:34.292 --> 02:35:40.034]  The President, under the Presidential Decision Directive 51 and others, is saying the Congress is ceremonial.
[02:35:40.034 --> 02:35:45.676]  Congress isn't allowed in the highest security clearances to see, you know, the full plans.
[02:35:45.676 --> 02:35:48.056]  Can you speak to that, Dr. Edwin Vieira?
[02:35:48.056 --> 02:35:51.237]  Well, of course, it's a constitutional impossibility.
[02:35:51.237 --> 02:35:52.798]  You know, you run down this list of things.
[02:35:53.274 --> 02:35:53.454]  I think
[02:36:13.052 --> 02:36:22.365]  Because we watched the Supreme Court look the other way with this question of Mr. Obama's eligibility for the presidency, which I should think is a fundamentally important issue.
[02:36:22.365 --> 02:36:24.368]  No problem there, they looked the other way.
[02:36:24.368 --> 02:36:28.493]  We looked at what you were talking about, National Security Decision Directive 51.
[02:36:30.095 --> 02:36:34.979]  Which, at least in principle, is an assertion of presidential control over the entire system.
[02:36:34.979 --> 02:36:36.500]  All checks and balances are gone.
[02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:40.743]  Do we see Congress responding to this, even with a resolution saying absolutely not?
[02:36:40.743 --> 02:36:42.384]  We're the ones in control here, not you.
[02:36:42.384 --> 02:36:44.126]  Of course we don't see that.
[02:36:44.126 --> 02:36:45.367]  Do we see the states?
[02:36:45.367 --> 02:36:47.428]  Well, now we're beginning to see the states.
[02:36:47.428 --> 02:36:53.833]  We're beginning to see this process of checks and balances work, actually from the way it should always have worked, from the bottom up.
[02:36:54.415 --> 02:37:05.229]  And the final layer, the foundational structure, as I love to keep telling people, we're told this over and over again in the Constitution, a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state.
[02:37:05.229 --> 02:37:12.539]  The only thing the Constitution says is necessary for any purpose whatsoever, and necessary for the ultimate purpose.
[02:37:12.979 --> 02:37:14.259]  But it depends upon what?
[02:37:14.259 --> 02:37:16.980]  It depends upon actual participation by people.
[02:37:16.980 --> 02:37:19.840]  It's not a spectator sport to live in a free society.
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:24.381]  It requires self-government, and therefore it requires some kind of commitment and activity.
[02:37:24.381 --> 02:37:26.242]  And that's what we haven't seen in the past.
[02:37:26.242 --> 02:37:28.622]  We're beginning to see people wake up to that.
[02:37:28.622 --> 02:37:37.564]  Obviously, these state legislatures, the legislators who are passing these Tenth Amendment or state sovereignty resolutions, are taking a stand on this.
[02:37:37.564 --> 02:37:39.745]  And it's wonderful from an educational point of view.
[02:37:39.745 --> 02:37:41.105]  But, as I said earlier in the show,
[02:37:41.730 --> 02:37:45.294]  We need to begin thinking about the implementation of those.
[02:37:45.294 --> 02:37:51.861]  The reassertion of actual state power and legal authority as an effective check and balance.
[02:37:51.861 --> 02:37:54.344]  Not simply a rhetorical check and balance.
[02:37:54.344 --> 02:37:55.605]  We're at that stage now.
[02:37:55.605 --> 02:37:57.167]  The rhetoric is coming out.
[02:37:57.167 --> 02:37:58.108]  That's excellent.
[02:37:58.108 --> 02:37:59.950]  The next step is the practice.
[02:38:02.501 --> 02:38:13.843]  Absolutely, and the good news is when you look at the state resolutions in Alabama, in New Hampshire, in Colorado, they've now passed it in Oklahoma through the House.
[02:38:15.359 --> 02:38:16.921]  And many other states are passing it.
[02:38:16.921 --> 02:38:20.064]  They're saying, look, the federal government isn't protecting the borders.
[02:38:20.064 --> 02:38:22.486]  We will, because you're not doing your responsibility.
[02:38:22.486 --> 02:38:25.069]  We're doing this under 10th Amendment rights and 9th Amendment.
[02:38:25.069 --> 02:38:26.911]  Look, we know you're building FEMA camps.
[02:38:26.911 --> 02:38:27.952]  I mean, it's in the bills.
[02:38:27.952 --> 02:38:28.973]  I have them right here.
[02:38:28.973 --> 02:38:37.701]  A new one, House Bill 225, that under martial law, HB 225 Alabama, you will not be allowed to wantonly cease firearms in case of declared state of emergency.
[02:38:38.882 --> 02:38:40.024]  On and on and on.
[02:38:40.024 --> 02:38:47.692]  And they cite in these bills the PDDs, the executive orders, the federal bills, the camps.
[02:38:47.692 --> 02:38:50.835]  I mean, this is showing a high level of education.
[02:38:50.835 --> 02:38:51.976]  And I talked to these state reps.
[02:38:51.976 --> 02:38:54.719]  We probably interviewed more than 20 of them in the last few weeks.
[02:38:54.719 --> 02:38:56.140]  We've got more coming on this week.
[02:38:56.140 --> 02:38:57.982]  The understanding is exploding.
[02:38:57.982 --> 02:38:59.303]  I mean, they know as much as I do.
[02:38:59.904 --> 02:39:13.193]  I don't know that you know as much as you do, you study this so closely, but they are highly informed, and they tell me that the knowledge of this is spreading like wildfire through government, not just state government, but the sub-parts, the counties, the cities, the police.
[02:39:13.193 --> 02:39:15.975]  So that is very, very exciting.
[02:39:15.975 --> 02:39:29.544]  So speak to that, and then I'd like you to talk about not just the state level, but the county, the power of the juries, the grand juries, the power of the sheriffs, the power of the committees of safety that you've been spearheading.
[02:39:30.924 --> 02:39:39.127]  Well, if we go back to that first educational point, the thing that interests me about this is that it does not seem to be a sectional phenomenon.
[02:39:39.127 --> 02:39:47.669]  This isn't something coming up only in, say, Alabama or Mississippi, or only coming up in some of those far western Rocky Mountain states.
[02:39:47.669 --> 02:39:51.030]  It's essentially all over the country.
[02:39:51.030 --> 02:39:57.472]  And that's, from my perspective at least, a very good sign that we really have a national
[02:39:59.679 --> 02:40:00.119]  Thank you.
[02:40:11.696 --> 02:40:14.017]  Can be brought into play, obviously.
[02:40:14.017 --> 02:40:25.280]  If you go to the jury system, informed individuals on a jury are going to take very seriously their responsibilities, and we may see that certain unjust laws don't get themselves enforced.
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:29.582]  Not because the juries essentially nullify them, but because they simply don't convict these people.
[02:40:29.582 --> 02:40:35.724]  They don't find the reasonable doubt necessary, beyond a reasonable doubt necessary, to convict people under some of these statutes.
[02:40:36.204 --> 02:40:39.047]  And under those circumstances, there's absolutely nothing that can be done.
[02:40:39.047 --> 02:40:41.449]  The statutes simply find themselves to be unenforceable.
[02:40:41.449 --> 02:40:55.861]  On the other side, grand juries, at least in those states where the grand juries are not entirely controlled by prosecutors or prosecuting attorneys and state court judges, we may see some of the more horrendous oppression
[02:40:56.796 --> 02:41:00.297]  Uh, being challenged and indictments being issued.
[02:41:00.297 --> 02:41:10.781]  I have a feeling that that may be one of the last steps, actually, because the first thing that has to be brought under control is what you were suggesting with the use of sheriffs, for instance.
[02:41:10.781 --> 02:41:15.303]  I am not so inclined to think that the sheriffs are enough.
[02:41:15.303 --> 02:41:21.825]  I think it's very good that they are waking up to their responsibilities and very good that they are waking up to the excessive intrusion
[02:41:22.703 --> 02:41:27.967]  At the state and local level that we're seeing from the so-called federal law enforcement agencies.
[02:41:27.967 --> 02:41:40.234]  But until we have the ultimate backup there, until we have the organization of very large numbers of people in state militias, I don't think the sheriffs are going to prove to be sufficient to deal with this problem.
[02:41:40.234 --> 02:41:41.575]  I think that's the key ultimately.
[02:41:41.575 --> 02:41:42.576]  It's organization.
[02:41:43.476 --> 02:41:44.576]  Of the people themselves.
[02:41:44.576 --> 02:41:49.638]  We've allowed the other side to tell us how we're going to be organized.
[02:41:49.638 --> 02:41:51.819]  In their phony political parties.
[02:41:51.819 --> 02:41:53.900]  In their phony special interest groups.
[02:41:53.900 --> 02:42:05.564]  And then otherwise to divide and conquer us so that we haven't been able to put together our unity really in the level of force that it could exercise.
[02:42:05.564 --> 02:42:07.585]  And ultimately the one way to do that
[02:42:08.502 --> 02:42:09.964]  With constitutional authority.
[02:42:09.964 --> 02:42:11.706]  This is a clear element in it.
[02:42:11.706 --> 02:42:15.510]  Constitutional authority from the national level all the way down to the local level.
[02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:22.858]  Because remember, the militia of the several states are elements of the federal constitution, not simply within the states and the localities.
[02:42:22.858 --> 02:42:25.260]  Is to revitalize those organizations.
[02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:29.345]  And organize, we're talking about tens of millions of people here, not a few thousand, a hundred thousand.
[02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:32.612]  But literally tens of millions of people.
[02:42:32.612 --> 02:42:43.041]  And if that kind of organization won't be sufficient to back up the sheriffs, to back up the local and state officials, to back up the grand juries, well then what would be?
[02:42:48.692 --> 02:42:55.056]  The Feds know, and I want to get your response to this, I know you're aware of this, but I want to, for the audience, break this down.
[02:42:55.056 --> 02:43:01.440]  For those that may not be fully aware of this key element, they know the states have the right to abolish the criminal federal government.
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:08.124]  They know the states have the right, through grand juries and other mechanisms and state legislative investigations, to go after
[02:43:08.724 --> 02:43:14.947]  Uh, criminals in government and these foreign bankers that have usurped the federal power and are now usurping the state power.
[02:43:14.947 --> 02:43:21.410]  So we're forced to carry out this operation against them or they're going to fully destroy the republic itself.
[02:43:21.410 --> 02:43:25.332]  Some spin this as if we're trying to get rid of the republic by secession.
[02:43:25.332 --> 02:43:27.233]  No, we're having the states redeclare their powers.
[02:43:27.233 --> 02:43:29.434]  Uh, but when you study this,
[02:43:30.174 --> 02:43:33.978]  You know, the Feds are coming in under emergency management and saying, we tell the local police what to do.
[02:43:33.978 --> 02:43:45.070]  You know, they're clearly usurping the system and the establishment knows their bureaucracy, their police, their Feds aren't even enough.
[02:43:45.070 --> 02:43:51.717]  That's why we've seen for decades the Feds setting this up, but now under Obama they're actually launching the full operation for a million man
[02:43:52.398 --> 02:44:20.014]  A civilian corps, the Pentagon's now signed the order to start the civilian corps to co-op the preachers, the pastors, the community, and give them little federal signets, even secret operations like InfraGard, 25,000 plus executives in government and in corporations being given secret, this is mainstream news, license to kill orders and firearms.
[02:44:20.014 --> 02:44:21.135]  So we have a covert
[02:44:21.855 --> 02:44:38.621]  True espionage operation by the globalists through the Feds going on, and that shows they know the policies they're bringing in are going to foment revolt and proper right to revolt under what I'd call, you know, the Article 10 in New Hampshire right to revolt, you know, one of the strongest out there.
[02:44:38.621 --> 02:44:41.202]  So can you speak to what I just laid out there?
[02:44:41.202 --> 02:44:44.763]  This is a real war going on in our communities.
[02:44:44.763 --> 02:44:45.323]  Well, let's recall.
[02:44:47.255 --> 02:44:51.952]  One of them is that within the general government itself, we actually have two categories.
[02:44:52.674 --> 02:44:53.434]  of individuals.
[02:44:53.434 --> 02:45:00.859]  We have what I would call the loyal public servants who are actually trying to live within the spirit, at least, of the Constitution.
[02:45:00.859 --> 02:45:05.321]  It's difficult to live within the letter given the extent of unconstitutional activity by that entity.
[02:45:05.321 --> 02:45:08.923]  And then we have what I like to call the rogue public officials.
[02:45:08.923 --> 02:45:17.748]  These are the ones who either don't care or intentionally are violating the Constitution for some individual gains, usually careerism of one kind or another.
[02:45:17.748 --> 02:45:21.490]  Those people are really acting in at least a quasi-criminal capacity.
[02:45:22.256 --> 02:45:26.120]  So I think, number one, they are not uniform at that level.
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:29.584]  They are not in a, as it were, in a unitary conspiracy against us.
[02:45:29.584 --> 02:45:33.648]  We have allies there, as well as at the state and local level.
[02:45:33.648 --> 02:45:38.573]  But on the other side of that coin, they obviously have a long-term game plan.
[02:45:38.573 --> 02:45:44.760]  I love this thing that Obama has pointed up, this idea that they need a huge
[02:45:45.581 --> 02:45:51.234]  A civilian national security force at least as large and well equipped as the armed forces and so forth and so on.
[02:45:51.234 --> 02:45:52.477]  That is exactly my point!
[02:45:53.436 --> 02:45:56.038]  That is precisely what we need.
[02:45:56.038 --> 02:46:00.661]  And the Constitution tells us where we're supposed to find that organization.
[02:46:00.661 --> 02:46:05.785]  But this is a federal... He has made my point, and I agree with him 100%.
[02:46:05.785 --> 02:46:09.267]  If we had that organization, we would solve a great deal of the problems in this country.
[02:46:09.267 --> 02:46:16.272]  But he's creating a federal doppelganger of the militia that serves the central state.
[02:46:16.272 --> 02:46:17.453]  That's right, that's right.
[02:46:17.453 --> 02:46:20.135]  But you see, he's admitted the principle
[02:46:20.735 --> 02:46:21.776]  He's admitted the principle.
[02:46:21.776 --> 02:46:23.878]  Now we say, thank you very much, Barack.
[02:46:23.878 --> 02:46:28.501]  Let's go over here to this page on the Constitution, and we see how to implement this.
[02:46:28.501 --> 02:46:31.483]  In a sense, he's being hoisted with his own petard.
[02:46:31.483 --> 02:46:37.508]  Because from a propagandistic point of view, it's going to be very difficult for him to say, well, I don't want this organization if you people control it.
[02:46:37.508 --> 02:46:39.249]  Then that wakes everybody up.
[02:46:39.249 --> 02:46:41.911]  Oh, you want the organization if you control it.
[02:46:41.911 --> 02:46:47.015]  We're going to have some kind of Hitler Youth here, or some kind of Red Guards, or Komsomol.
[02:46:47.015 --> 02:46:48.316]  That's what you want to set up.
[02:46:48.316 --> 02:46:48.877]  Aha!
[02:46:48.877 --> 02:46:50.138]  Now we go to the next level.
[02:46:50.638 --> 02:46:52.519]  Of public awareness.
[02:46:52.519 --> 02:46:53.759]  Of what we're really dealing with.
[02:46:53.759 --> 02:46:56.180]  It's no longer listening to Alex Jones say this.
[02:46:56.180 --> 02:47:00.441]  It's listening to Barack Obama tell us that he wants it this way.
[02:47:00.441 --> 02:47:04.563]  I think it's extraordinarily dangerous the position he's put himself in from his point of view.
[02:47:04.563 --> 02:47:05.943]  Because he's made my point.
[02:47:05.943 --> 02:47:07.364]  He's made the Constitutional point.
[02:47:07.364 --> 02:47:13.506]  The situation has become so dire in this country that we have to go to essentially that last line of defense.
[02:47:13.506 --> 02:47:16.767]  And the Constitution tells us who's supposed to be in that last line of defense.
[02:47:16.767 --> 02:47:17.567]  It's us, not him.
[02:47:18.007 --> 02:47:20.668]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, here's my issue.
[02:47:20.668 --> 02:47:29.993]  We can say that there's the good guys in government and the rogues, and we know it's the good men and women who have held this back and slowed it down, but now it's total tyranny is arriving.
[02:47:29.993 --> 02:47:32.594]  And we saw this in Germany and Russia and many other places.
[02:47:32.594 --> 02:47:36.276]  The rogues have gotten in all the major power positions at the highest levels.
[02:47:36.276 --> 02:47:44.119]  They're bringing in their personnel, expanding their cadres, and I think it's fair to say this is a completely rogue government.
[02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:47.581]  You know, every major operational level.
[02:47:47.581 --> 02:47:49.301]  The directives are rogue.
[02:47:49.301 --> 02:47:59.665]  There may be people that sluggishly implement it throughout the machinery, but I think we need to declare this as the founding fathers did, as Patrick Henry did, as a completely bankrupt, rogue government.
[02:47:59.665 --> 02:48:09.008]  Well, except for the fact that the major element in the government, which the Constitution tells us is the one necessary, we haven't yet implemented it.
[02:48:09.008 --> 02:48:13.509]  We're the ones who are this ultimate power in the government.
[02:48:13.509 --> 02:48:14.870]  And for a hundred and some fifty years,
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:30.428]  Uh, the people in control in Washington and to a large extent the state governments have let the militia acrify to the point that they are... I won't... Your phone was cutting out there, doctor.
[02:48:30.428 --> 02:48:32.729]  We may have lost him.
[02:48:32.729 --> 02:48:34.370]  Folks, they've usurped the militia.
[02:48:36.232 --> 02:48:38.213]  And that's what they do.
[02:48:38.213 --> 02:48:51.117]  When the police walk over to you and say, don't videotape us when you're standing a hundred yards away, or when they come up and say you can't videotape the Golden Gate Bridge, but everybody else can and they can surveil you and Google Maps has it right there, they are exercising power.
[02:48:51.117 --> 02:48:59.720]  Just like we don't exercise our power to be sovereigns and stand up and have liberty, we've been cowed, we've been intimidated, we've been trained and taught to stand down.
[02:49:02.335 --> 02:49:04.356]  And they've trained us to be slaves.
[02:49:04.356 --> 02:49:06.056]  They've trained us like you train a dog.
[02:49:06.056 --> 02:49:09.377]  To follow orders and do what we're told.
[02:49:09.377 --> 02:49:23.362]  And so we have to have this awakening to how bankrupt they are and how what they've set up is a counterfeit of our country and they're now even removing the final, even ceremonial vestiges of freedom here.
[02:49:23.362 --> 02:49:25.022]  These are illegitimate criminals.
[02:49:25.022 --> 02:49:28.324]  Sir, your phone broke up there.
[02:49:28.324 --> 02:49:29.284]  Please continue with your point.
[02:49:29.810 --> 02:49:30.511]  Back now, Alex.
[02:49:30.511 --> 02:49:31.512]  Well, no, I agree with you.
[02:49:31.512 --> 02:49:38.779]  All I'm saying is we can't allow that to deflect us from our own course.
[02:49:38.779 --> 02:49:43.563]  Yes, this is what they're doing, but what is the one way in the long run to defeat them?
[02:49:43.563 --> 02:49:50.530]  It's to organize ourselves on a sound constitutional basis with legal authority and the power at the local level.
[02:49:50.530 --> 02:49:54.374]  We can do that if we simply will ourselves to do it.
[02:49:55.524 --> 02:49:59.866]  I don't see how they can stop us short of imposing that ultimate police state tyranny.
[02:49:59.866 --> 02:50:03.588]  And then, obviously, at that stage when they attempt to do that, all bets are off.
[02:50:03.588 --> 02:50:11.953]  We're in the Declaration of Independence situation, and, you know, it's a matter of as much as political power comes out of the barrel of a gun.
[02:50:11.953 --> 02:50:13.534]  We're not quite there yet.
[02:50:13.534 --> 02:50:21.338]  We still have the ability, if we're willing and smart enough, to take the steps necessary to bring ourselves back into that constitutional structure.
[02:50:22.106 --> 02:50:29.854]  Uh, and all I'm looking for is the next step in what we've seen in these Sovereignty Resolutions, the enforcement mechanism.
[02:50:29.854 --> 02:50:33.057]  Let's take those Sovereignty Resolutions to their logical conclusion.
[02:50:33.057 --> 02:50:33.497]  Stay there.
[02:50:33.497 --> 02:50:40.724]  Let's talk about those enforcement mechanisms and what you've really been pushing these, um, committees of security or, um...
[02:50:43.186 --> 02:50:46.529]  You know, committees of public order.
[02:50:46.529 --> 02:50:48.231]  How the people take back control of their government.
[02:50:48.231 --> 02:50:52.716]  And then the other ace in the hole the enemy has, staged terror attacks.
[02:50:52.716 --> 02:50:56.119]  You know, when Oklahoma and others passed resolutions saying they weren't going under U.N.
[02:50:56.119 --> 02:50:59.402]  control, we know what happened in Oklahoma City and we know who did it.
[02:50:59.402 --> 02:50:59.823]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.587 --> 02:51:05.051]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:51:05.051 --> 02:51:08.836]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:51:08.836 --> 02:51:15.143]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[02:51:15.143 --> 02:51:19.248]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:51:19.748 --> 02:51:25.772]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:51:25.772 --> 02:51:29.195]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:51:29.195 --> 02:51:33.858]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:51:33.858 --> 02:51:40.082]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:51:40.082 --> 02:51:45.065]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:52:00.379 --> 02:52:01.640]  Call today.
[02:52:01.640 --> 02:52:08.407]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:52:08.407 --> 02:52:10.069]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:52:11.044 --> 02:52:12.585]  But who is the enemy?
[02:52:12.585 --> 02:52:13.386]  Bin Laden.
[02:52:13.386 --> 02:52:14.366]  This is his ammo.
[02:52:14.366 --> 02:52:15.748]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:52:15.748 --> 02:52:17.749]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:52:17.749 --> 02:52:24.894]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:52:24.894 --> 02:52:25.375]  Some U.S.
[02:52:25.375 --> 02:52:31.019]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:31.719 --> 02:52:35.601]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:35.601 --> 02:52:45.684]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:52:45.684 --> 02:52:46.925]  Fabled enemies.

[02:53:01.622 --> 02:53:05.165]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[02:53:05.165 --> 02:53:07.647]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?

[02:54:06.513 --> 02:54:14.958]  Final segment with Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[02:54:14.958 --> 02:54:25.784]  Doctor, be sure and follow your website and some of your great books and for folks to get involved with you and the Committees of Safety modeled after what happened in the decade before the Revolutionary War.
[02:54:25.784 --> 02:54:31.368]  People communicated and set up their own true government outside of the British regional unelected governors.
[02:54:34.025 --> 02:54:36.267]  This is an organizational fight.
[02:54:36.267 --> 02:54:39.209]  In summation, how do folks support you?
[02:54:39.209 --> 02:54:39.930]  How do they get involved?
[02:54:39.930 --> 02:54:46.855]  How do they take your great constitutional ideas and put them into action in the field?
[02:54:46.855 --> 02:54:49.557]  Well, first they can go to newswithviews.com.
[02:54:49.557 --> 02:54:56.242]  There's a large archive there of articles I have written on these subjects over the past several years.
[02:54:56.242 --> 02:55:02.227]  Then, number two, they can go to committeesofsafety.com or committeesofsafety.org.
[02:55:03.639 --> 02:55:15.019]  And you'll see what some people at least are doing to attempt to revitalize malicious structures and other forms of local organization to deal with these problems in a strictly constitutional fashion.
[02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:22.323]  And you can find some links there to my books and some DVDs that have been put out, which will be useful.
[02:55:22.323 --> 02:55:25.565]  These people tell me that they've been proven to be very useful.
[02:55:25.565 --> 02:55:29.547]  And of course, at this stage, we need education in the second step.
[02:55:29.547 --> 02:55:36.150]  That first step, the education has succeeded, obviously, and we're seeing more states passing these sovereignty resolutions.
[02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:40.372]  The second step now is to expand that education into the implementation stage.
[02:55:41.002 --> 02:55:53.593]  And ultimately, that implementation has to be done by local organizing, and then through local organizing, bringing grassroots pressure to bear on the state legislatures, and passing the next stage statutes.
[02:55:53.593 --> 02:55:56.755]  Some of these are monetary reform statutes.
[02:55:56.755 --> 02:55:57.796]  Indiana has one.
[02:55:57.796 --> 02:55:58.777]  Missouri has one.
[02:55:58.777 --> 02:56:00.719]  Colorado has one.
[02:56:00.719 --> 02:56:03.881]  Montana, the one that's going in there, there's one in Georgia.
[02:56:03.881 --> 02:56:09.006]  They're cropping up all over the country as a result, I think, of a statute I wrote in New Hampshire several years ago.
[02:56:09.958 --> 02:56:10.338]  I don't think so.
[02:56:25.643 --> 02:56:32.948]  That these other issues of local organization and the revitalization of the militia will go on to the front burner as well.
[02:56:32.948 --> 02:56:38.532]  And at that stage, we really begin to take back the country from the local and state level.
[02:56:38.532 --> 02:56:40.854]  Because it's through local and state organizations.
[02:56:40.854 --> 02:56:41.314]  Okay.
[02:56:41.314 --> 02:56:43.015]  Getting all the legislation, we're going to do it.
[02:56:43.015 --> 02:56:46.158]  Doctor, but the globalists, as you know, aren't going to sit on their hands.
[02:56:46.158 --> 02:56:49.180]  And they are going to stage crises, stage wars.
[02:56:49.180 --> 02:56:51.041]  They're very bold, that's why they're in power.
[02:56:51.041 --> 02:56:52.762]  They take action, the people don't.
[02:56:52.762 --> 02:56:54.343]  At least in modern times.
[02:56:55.584 --> 02:57:00.826]  What do we do about the Feds, the illegitimate Feds, staging events, staging crises?
[02:57:00.826 --> 02:57:03.107]  I mean, openly saying Barack Obama may be like Lincoln.
[02:57:03.107 --> 02:57:06.128]  They're openly saying they may come in and swat down states.
[02:57:06.128 --> 02:57:12.450]  I mean, their entire battle build up, and under the John Warr Defense Authorization Act, they say governors will be federal, dual-hatted.
[02:57:12.450 --> 02:57:14.311]  I mean, this is all happening.
[02:57:14.311 --> 02:57:16.191]  Well, the governors, let's start with the governors.
[02:57:16.191 --> 02:57:17.892]  The governors simply have to refuse that.
[02:57:17.892 --> 02:57:21.313]  If we're talking about people that have been educated in terms of state sovereignty,
[02:57:22.012 --> 02:57:28.540]  I'm the true position of the states and the Constitution, they have to refuse to go along with unconstitutional directives no matter where they come from.
[02:57:28.540 --> 02:57:35.328]  And ultimately if they're talking about, if you're talking about a scenario in which it's, the goal is for some of these rogue politicians to actually suppress
[02:57:36.625 --> 02:57:44.290]  A large segment of this country, then the only solution to that is for those large segments of the country to organize themselves beforehand.
[02:57:44.290 --> 02:57:47.652]  I mean, self-government requires self-reliance, ultimately self-protection.
[02:57:47.652 --> 02:57:48.813]  Yes, well that's what we're doing.
[02:57:48.813 --> 02:57:54.276]  We're here mobilizing and letting folks know the playbook of the globalists that have now hijacked the nation.
[02:57:54.276 --> 02:57:56.838]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, I want to thank you for spending all this time with us.
[02:57:56.838 --> 02:57:57.818]  Thank you.
[02:57:57.818 --> 02:58:01.200]  Did you get any response last time you were on to folks wanting to set their own?
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:02.661]  Yes, I certainly did.
[02:58:02.661 --> 02:58:05.383]  Your people are well in touch with what's going on.
[02:58:05.899 --> 02:58:10.881]  Okay, well give us the websites so folks can also get involved in your committees of safety.
[02:58:10.881 --> 02:58:20.925]  Okay, the first website for educational purposes, newswithviews.com, and then for activism, committeesofsafety.com.
[02:58:21.471 --> 02:58:22.251]  All right.
[02:58:22.251 --> 02:58:25.633]  I want to talk to you again in the next few months as all this develops and unfolds.
[02:58:25.633 --> 02:58:28.834]  We thank you for your tireless defense of the Republic.
[02:58:28.834 --> 02:58:29.894]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, take care.
[02:58:29.894 --> 02:58:31.315]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:31.315 --> 02:58:34.176]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back with the next hour.
[02:58:34.176 --> 02:58:36.076]  We've got a state senator joining us.
[02:58:36.076 --> 02:58:38.197]  He's trying to declare sovereignty right here in Texas.
[02:58:38.197 --> 02:58:43.099]  Don't forget our websites, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:58:43.099 --> 02:58:44.179]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.179 --> 02:58:47.240]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.476 --> 02:58:53.157]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.157 --> 02:58:57.899]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.899 --> 02:59:00.860]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.860 --> 02:59:03.901]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.901 --> 02:59:08.623]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.863 --> 02:59:09.985]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.985 --> 02:59:13.229]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.229 --> 02:59:20.219]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.219 --> 02:59:23.503]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.503 --> 02:59:23.764]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:26.167 --> 02:59:28.648]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:28.648 --> 02:59:34.892]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:59:34.892 --> 02:59:38.674]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.674 --> 02:59:40.015]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.015 --> 02:59:40.655]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.655 --> 02:59:42.476]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.249 --> 02:59:56.653]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.653 --> 02:59:59.417]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.212 --> 03:00:14.814]  Well, we're already into the fourth and final hour.
[03:00:14.814 --> 03:00:17.476]  We've got about 59 and a half minutes laying out before us.
[03:00:17.476 --> 03:00:22.080]  We have a state senator saying if the feds won't protect the border, the state will.
[03:00:22.080 --> 03:00:24.202]  His only problem is Rick Perry's going to try to block him.
[03:00:24.202 --> 03:00:25.303]  You watch.
[03:00:25.303 --> 03:00:29.306]  He loves to paint himself as a patriot and conservative, but that's not the case.
[03:00:29.306 --> 03:00:31.348]  Mexico on the verge of collapsing.
[03:00:31.348 --> 03:00:32.910]  That's the State Department.
[03:00:33.942 --> 03:00:46.204]  The yuppies have no idea they're still traveling down there to be shut down by the Mexican police, even the resort towns now, as that nation fully collapses via corruption, just like the United States is starting to collapse from corruption.
[03:00:46.204 --> 03:00:51.725]  I mentioned this yesterday and a little bit earlier, but I want to spend some time on this later, too, after the state senator leaves us.
[03:00:51.725 --> 03:00:54.946]  Texas unknowingly donate children's blood to research.
[03:00:54.946 --> 03:01:00.207]  Medical privacy advocates, ethicists say parents should be asked for consent before newborn screening samples are kept.
[03:01:00.207 --> 03:01:00.367]  Yeah.
[03:01:01.047 --> 03:01:03.848]  You know, I've refused this, and when they come in, they go, it's the law.
[03:01:03.848 --> 03:01:06.949]  The health department has to test for your baby having diseases.
[03:01:06.949 --> 03:01:09.670]  And I go, nurse, I'm not ignorant.
[03:01:09.670 --> 03:01:16.092]  I happen to know that goes to the health department, and it's put in an international DNA database, and you claim you own my children's DNA and patent it.
[03:01:16.092 --> 03:01:19.833]  I've seen the federal court cases, and they go, and then they back off.
[03:01:21.215 --> 03:01:28.160]  One time I was so busy, I've had three children, I just was busy and just, you know, signed this and looked at it halfway and thought it was discharge papers.
[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:28.980]  I did sign one.
[03:01:28.980 --> 03:01:31.562]  I mean, you know, because they just slip it in on you.
[03:01:31.562 --> 03:01:36.305]  It was like a sleep on the couch and then they come in, sleep in the chair.
[03:01:36.305 --> 03:01:37.726]  This is the criminality of government.
[03:01:37.726 --> 03:01:38.687]  This is what it does.
[03:01:38.687 --> 03:01:39.607]  This is how it operates.
[03:01:39.607 --> 03:01:44.030]  And people's denial, I would talk about this for years.
[03:01:44.030 --> 03:01:48.553]  For year, after year, after year, after year.
[03:01:48.553 --> 03:01:50.194]  If you're 30, almost 36, it started
[03:01:52.170 --> 03:01:54.591]  In 1973.
[03:01:54.591 --> 03:01:58.692]  Worldwide, wherever the IMF and World Bank control things, because they control our governments, this was done.
[03:01:58.692 --> 03:02:01.153]  A global DNA database.
[03:02:01.153 --> 03:02:02.834]  And they can use this to frame you, you name it.
[03:02:02.834 --> 03:02:06.075]  So I want to read some of the story before the show ends.
[03:02:06.075 --> 03:02:07.856]  It was also in UPI.
[03:02:07.856 --> 03:02:10.897]  But it's only about Texas, because we've been exposing it here.
[03:02:10.897 --> 03:02:11.937]  This is all over the world.
[03:02:11.937 --> 03:02:17.039]  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, England, Canada.
[03:02:17.039 --> 03:02:18.139]  This is everywhere.
[03:02:18.139 --> 03:02:19.240]  This is criminal.
[03:02:20.259 --> 03:02:25.484]  And so we'll break down this whitewash and go over a little bit of that.
[03:02:25.484 --> 03:02:30.048]  I've also got some other important stories I want to cover dealing with, they want to tax forest fires.
[03:02:30.048 --> 03:02:35.453]  They want to tax you nationally if there's forest fires, because forest fires put off carbon dioxide and that's toxic waste.
[03:02:35.453 --> 03:02:38.296]  I mean, they're just going to tax everything.
[03:02:38.296 --> 03:02:42.020]  So we'll be going over that report for you as well today.
[03:02:42.020 --> 03:02:44.202]  Before I end this segment,
[03:02:45.831 --> 03:02:48.653]  Let's go ahead and pull up the ObamaDeception.net website.
[03:02:48.653 --> 03:02:49.774]  Can we pipe in that audio?
[03:02:49.774 --> 03:02:59.002]  I want to show people the site and who are watching at PrisonPlanet.tv and encourage you to go to ObamaDeception.net or TheObamaDeception.net.
[03:02:59.002 --> 03:03:00.243]  Both will get you there.
[03:03:00.243 --> 03:03:06.448]  And watch the trailer, read the data page, research about this, and then get involved.
[03:03:06.448 --> 03:03:08.810]  I want you to get the Obama Deception on DVD.
[03:03:08.810 --> 03:03:09.691]  I want you to order it.
[03:03:09.691 --> 03:03:10.712]  It ships March 15th.
[03:03:10.712 --> 03:03:11.132]  Pre-order it.
[03:03:11.132 --> 03:03:12.634]  You'll be the first to get it in the mail.
[03:03:12.634 --> 03:03:13.915]  That's only two and a half weeks away now.
[03:03:15.393 --> 03:03:21.076]  Please get The Obama Deception at Infowars.com or TheObamaDeception.net or call toll free to get it.
[03:03:21.076 --> 03:03:22.237]  Get your pre-order in now.
[03:03:22.237 --> 03:03:26.019]  We also have these great t-shirts that have half of Bush's face saying, Worst President Ever.
[03:03:26.019 --> 03:03:29.161]  The other half's Obama and it says, Until Now.
[03:03:29.161 --> 03:03:35.525]  That shatters the left-right paradigm, sparks conversations with Obamanoids and Bushoids.
[03:03:35.525 --> 03:03:36.445]  You can explain it.
[03:03:36.445 --> 03:03:38.546]  Don't you understand they give you false choices?
[03:03:38.546 --> 03:03:41.168]  They show you both of these people.
[03:03:42.865 --> 03:03:49.069]  And then they lay him out, and then you think you have a choice, like going on a used car lot, and he says, here's the two cars you can buy.
[03:03:49.069 --> 03:03:50.230]  These are the two choices you've got.
[03:03:50.230 --> 03:03:53.192]  What about expanding those choices?
[03:03:53.192 --> 03:03:57.955]  The Obama deception doesn't get into was he born in Kenya or, you know, is he a commie or whatever.
[03:03:57.955 --> 03:04:05.540]  It gets into the fact he lied about everything he said he'd do, his globalist agenda is evil, gun confiscation, FEMA camps, everything Bush was setting up.
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:22.610]  On steroids, continuing with Barack Obama, because the public blames everything on Bush, they remove the puppet, put the new puppet in, takes four to eight years for people to wake up to that he's a puppet, and they put in a new puppet, and we never look at the power behind the throne, we never look at the establishment, we never look at who's setting these globalist policies.
[03:04:22.610 --> 03:04:25.852]  We have the same policies here that are in England, that are in Australia, that are in Germany.
[03:04:25.852 --> 03:04:28.113]  It's the same social engineers.
[03:04:28.113 --> 03:04:34.637]  This is a program, a control plan, they're on record about it, all we've got to do is tell the truth about this, and the new order's going to fail.
[03:04:35.831 --> 03:04:45.075]  TheObamadeception.net, ladies and gentlemen, or Infowars.com, or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:04:45.075 --> 03:04:46.855]  888-253-3139.
[03:04:46.855 --> 03:04:51.397]  We'll be right back after this quick break for more news and information.
[03:04:51.397 --> 03:05:01.781]  We've got a state senator coming up as the states rebel against the New World Order.
[03:05:01.781 --> 03:05:04.382]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[03:05:05.006 --> 03:05:08.329]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[03:05:08.329 --> 03:05:12.112]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[03:05:12.112 --> 03:05:18.698]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[03:05:18.698 --> 03:05:23.922]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[03:05:23.922 --> 03:05:30.628]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[03:05:30.948 --> 03:05:32.029]  Need something more?
[03:05:32.029 --> 03:05:35.992]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[03:05:35.992 --> 03:05:44.279]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.

[03:05:48.843 --> 03:05:52.345]  Visit MrDefense.com, that's MRDefense.com, or call 1-800-313-6400.
[03:05:52.345 --> 03:05:53.966]  That's 1-800-313-6400 for all of your self-defense needs today.
[03:06:11.229 --> 03:06:12.770]  But who is the enemy?
[03:06:12.770 --> 03:06:13.571]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:13.571 --> 03:06:14.572]  This is his M.O.
[03:06:14.572 --> 03:06:15.953]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:15.953 --> 03:06:17.934]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:17.934 --> 03:06:25.099]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:06:25.099 --> 03:06:25.580]  Some U.S.
[03:06:25.580 --> 03:06:31.224]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:31.904 --> 03:06:35.427]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:35.427 --> 03:06:38.409]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:07:01.912 --> 03:07:12.482]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:07:12.482 --> 03:07:13.903]  Garden in a Can.
[03:07:13.903 --> 03:07:18.047]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[03:07:18.047 --> 03:07:20.069]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[03:07:20.069 --> 03:07:22.351]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[03:07:22.811 --> 03:07:32.499]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[03:07:32.499 --> 03:07:33.920]  Garden in a can.
[03:07:33.920 --> 03:07:35.121]  It's that simple.
[03:07:35.121 --> 03:07:35.821]  Fresh.
[03:07:35.821 --> 03:07:36.702]  Healthy.
[03:07:36.702 --> 03:07:37.523]  Easy.
[03:07:37.523 --> 03:07:41.866]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[03:07:41.866 --> 03:07:42.747]  Ready when you are.
[03:07:43.422 --> 03:07:47.506]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden In A Can.
[03:07:47.506 --> 03:07:50.989]  For more details visit GardenInACan.com today.
[03:07:50.989 --> 03:07:53.131]  That's GardenInACan.com.
[03:07:53.131 --> 03:07:53.612]  Or call 866-598-7396.
[03:07:53.612 --> 03:07:53.672]  866-598-7396.
[03:07:53.672 --> 03:07:55.133]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:55.133 --> 03:07:56.094]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.335 --> 03:08:14.618]  Coming up, I'm going to play two different pieces of Pentagon propaganda.
[03:08:14.618 --> 03:08:15.398]  One, the new G.I.
[03:08:15.398 --> 03:08:18.680]  Joe movie trailer, The Rise of Cobra.
[03:08:18.680 --> 03:08:22.102]  Cobra!
[03:08:22.102 --> 03:08:29.006]  And then, I'm going to play a Kid Rock propaganda video.
[03:08:29.006 --> 03:08:32.908]  The Pentagon is talking about $40 plus billion.
[03:08:32.908 --> 03:08:38.371]  Worldwide, upwards of $10 billion of that domestically to pay for music videos, movies,
[03:08:39.611 --> 03:08:41.312]  It's called propaganda placement.
[03:08:41.312 --> 03:08:42.432]  They call it product placement.
[03:08:42.432 --> 03:08:44.673]  I call it propaganda placement.
[03:08:44.673 --> 03:08:46.294]  And it's going on everywhere.
[03:08:46.294 --> 03:08:49.575]  So we'll be playing those videos live at PrisonPlanet.tv and analyzing them.
[03:08:49.575 --> 03:08:53.077]  Of course, the radio listeners will hear the audio as well.
[03:08:53.077 --> 03:08:54.938]  And I'll stop and comment on it.
[03:08:56.035 --> 03:08:57.075]  Then I'll get into some other news.
[03:08:57.075 --> 03:09:07.197]  We have State Senator Dan Patrick, one of the most powerful state senators, saying that they're going to put state forces on the border because Mexico's collapsing and the feds won't stop it.
[03:09:07.197 --> 03:09:07.857]  That's the plan.
[03:09:07.857 --> 03:09:14.318]  It's in the Security Prosperity Partnership documents to basically let the border collapse and collapse Mexico to overrun the U.S.
[03:09:14.318 --> 03:09:22.600]  Then say a North American Union security perimeter contiguous on the North American continent no longer borders in Mexico and Canada
[03:09:23.717 --> 03:09:30.578]  With the U.S., but contiguous from Guatemala, border with Mexico, all the way up to Alaska.
[03:09:30.578 --> 03:09:32.619]  This is all on record, and they're going to do it through crises.
[03:09:32.619 --> 03:09:40.420]  They create crises, banking crises, military crises, terror crises, refugee crises, and then offer their solution.
[03:09:40.420 --> 03:09:43.821]  I told you three years ago they were racing to pass amnesty.
[03:09:43.821 --> 03:09:50.943]  I'm on record because Mexico was going to collapse, and they wanted to go ahead and have the amnesty plan set up beforehand.
[03:09:50.943 --> 03:09:51.923]  Now it's going to be harder for them.
[03:09:53.059 --> 03:09:57.022]  But for the next 10 minutes, I always love having him up once a month.
[03:09:57.022 --> 03:10:02.046]  And that's Marty Schachter of CalbinPureSoap.com or FiveStarSoap.com.
[03:10:02.046 --> 03:10:04.588]  The reason I have him on is it really is a public service announcement.
[03:10:04.588 --> 03:10:09.051]  He's not just a great sponsor for now about four or five years.
[03:10:09.051 --> 03:10:14.515]  Marty has been in the organic soap business, California Certified Organic, before they even had that.
[03:10:14.515 --> 03:10:16.036]  I mean, he's the standard of it.
[03:10:16.036 --> 03:10:17.277]  Only sold to institutions.
[03:10:18.652 --> 03:10:20.253]  And then we found out about the soap.
[03:10:20.253 --> 03:10:21.313]  It was so great.
[03:10:21.313 --> 03:10:24.735]  And usually organic soap costs two or three times what the toxic detergents do.
[03:10:24.735 --> 03:10:27.336]  His is 85% off what the toxic detergents are.
[03:10:27.336 --> 03:10:29.357]  Forget the huge premium for organic.
[03:10:29.357 --> 03:10:30.918]  And these are the best organics out there.
[03:10:30.918 --> 03:10:33.939]  A lot of organics are too strong or burn you.
[03:10:33.939 --> 03:10:36.640]  He was in chemical weapons in World War II.
[03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:39.001]  Started Calvin Soap when he got back with his dad.
[03:10:39.001 --> 03:10:42.023]  Now he runs it with his son and family in Oakland, California.
[03:10:43.465 --> 03:10:54.227]  And this is Factory Direct, but the reason he's here is last time I had him on, we didn't have time to get into what is in the stuff you're using at the store versus what organic soap is.
[03:10:54.227 --> 03:10:56.168]  Marty, it's great to have you here with us.
[03:10:56.168 --> 03:10:57.228]  Hello, Alex.
[03:10:57.228 --> 03:11:01.149]  You have reached the Department of Homeland Cleanliness.
[03:11:01.149 --> 03:11:05.489]  Your satisfaction is guaranteed, or double your dirt bag.
[03:11:05.489 --> 03:11:12.951]  Let us at Cal Bend bail you out with our stimulus packages of one through five years of soap.
[03:11:13.507 --> 03:11:17.408]  At a cost of 40 cents to 20 cents a day.
[03:11:17.408 --> 03:11:21.709]  No more 20 to 30 dollar deficits a week.
[03:11:21.709 --> 03:11:24.389]  No junk science detergent chemicals.
[03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:27.030]  No more getting ripped off for cleanliness.
[03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:34.271]  No more deteriorating clothing, burning skin, itching scalp, outsourced products.
[03:11:34.271 --> 03:11:35.711]  No more.
[03:11:35.711 --> 03:11:39.112]  This is our goal, this is our philosophy, and we share it.
[03:11:41.553 --> 03:11:43.453]  Marty, let's start at the beginning.
[03:11:43.453 --> 03:11:47.634]  Why did you start Calvin Pierce Soap in 1947?
[03:11:47.634 --> 03:11:55.855]  Well, when I got out of the Army in 1947, after serving two years in Japan, my father left civil service.
[03:11:55.855 --> 03:11:57.536]  He was getting too old for that.
[03:11:57.536 --> 03:12:06.617]  They let him go, and we discovered, coincidentally, going to a supermarket shopping, that soap doesn't exist anymore.
[03:12:06.617 --> 03:12:10.858]  Like dirt, like ivory, like feldmapter, like viking.
[03:12:11.405 --> 03:12:12.725]  It was all detergents.
[03:12:12.725 --> 03:12:15.266]  Well, I learned in the Army what detergents were.
[03:12:15.266 --> 03:12:16.286]  They were a poison.
[03:12:16.286 --> 03:12:18.727]  They were made for poison gases.
[03:12:18.727 --> 03:12:25.569]  And we said, you know, that'd be a unique situation if we could start a small business selling real soap.
[03:12:25.569 --> 03:12:29.510]  Well, the only way we could do that was going to commercial enterprises.
[03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:33.712]  The hotels, motels, rest homes, convalescent hospitals.
[03:12:33.712 --> 03:12:35.552]  We couldn't get on the shelf anyway.
[03:12:35.552 --> 03:12:36.613]  No way.
[03:12:36.613 --> 03:12:38.893]  Procter & Gamble, Lever, and Colgate.
[03:12:38.893 --> 03:12:41.114]  They dominated the marketplace.
[03:12:41.910 --> 03:12:51.937]  With billions of dollars worth of advertising and hypnotism and all the ways of brainwashing the consumer to get these toxic detergents.
[03:12:51.937 --> 03:12:55.059]  And we just started a little small company.
[03:12:55.059 --> 03:13:04.485]  My father and I started calling our hospitals and schools and we were accepted because our products were virtually twice as good and half the price.
[03:13:04.485 --> 03:13:09.729]  So we built up our business institutionally and then about four years ago I got a call
[03:13:10.239 --> 03:13:13.060]  From Genesis Communication Network.
[03:13:13.060 --> 03:13:14.320]  What was his name?
[03:13:14.320 --> 03:13:14.981]  No, it was Michael Drudeau.
[03:13:14.981 --> 03:13:16.441]  It was actually about seven years ago.
[03:13:16.441 --> 03:13:17.021]  Time flies.
[03:13:17.021 --> 03:13:20.362]  But, Marty, let's stop right there.
[03:13:20.362 --> 03:13:25.764]  The reason toxic waste costs a lot more is because of all the advertising.
[03:13:25.764 --> 03:13:29.426]  Big Oil had all this toxic waste from the refining of oil process.
[03:13:29.426 --> 03:13:30.606]  I know you were in the chemical course.
[03:13:30.606 --> 03:13:32.387]  You know this, but the audience doesn't.
[03:13:32.387 --> 03:13:35.848]  They have all these byproducts, like sodium fluoride they put in the water.
[03:13:36.966 --> 03:13:41.668]  It's like China admits they dump their toxic waste in our food and then ship it to us.
[03:13:41.668 --> 03:13:43.049]  It's how they get rid of toxic waste.
[03:13:43.049 --> 03:13:44.809]  It's like lawn fertilizer.
[03:13:44.809 --> 03:13:49.772]  It says don't use this on vegetable or on farms because it's full of mercury, lead, arsenic.
[03:13:49.772 --> 03:13:50.932]  It runs off.
[03:13:50.932 --> 03:13:53.553]  That's how it's done.
[03:13:53.553 --> 03:14:03.718]  You discovered all that and put this out and we're not kidding when we tell people what is in the so-called soap that's really detergents that people
[03:14:08.469 --> 03:14:28.783]  Well, most of the detergents are made from waste petroleum, high alkalinity chemicals, and another ingredient that they add in large amounts is sodium chloride.
[03:14:28.783 --> 03:14:30.424]  And people think that's a new cleaner.
[03:14:30.424 --> 03:14:32.886]  Sodium chloride is table salt.
[03:14:33.356 --> 03:14:39.998]  Would you wash your face, your body, your baby, your home with table salt?
[03:14:39.998 --> 03:14:41.518]  No, we don't believe in that.
[03:14:41.518 --> 03:14:46.320]  We make our products from vegetable oils, coconut oils.
[03:14:46.320 --> 03:14:53.542]  We use juices from cherries, from almonds, instead of perfumes, which are toxic.
[03:14:53.542 --> 03:14:58.003]  And it's been very successful by the thousands and thousands of
[03:14:58.664 --> 03:15:24.297]  Alex Jones listeners that are buying our products now repeatedly and it's been a real beneficial to know that we can share products that we've developed and since 1947 when we started 62 years ago and our slogan developed is our business is going down the drain and we we're very proud of that that people buy our products that they're safe that they do the job
[03:15:24.770 --> 03:15:31.013]  And they're far, far superior than anything offered in the supermarket right now.
[03:15:31.013 --> 03:15:39.177]  And it's a pleasure to have and to be endorsed by Alex and share our knowledge and our philosophy.
[03:15:39.177 --> 03:15:40.778]  Well, Marty, you're a sweetheart.
[03:15:40.778 --> 03:15:43.399]  I mean, it's just a great product and a great price.
[03:15:43.399 --> 03:15:47.722]  Factory Direct, 62 years, family business.
[03:15:47.722 --> 03:15:51.283]  I guess Bob Dylan would say someday growing your own garden will be against the law.
[03:15:51.283 --> 03:15:54.045]  I'm surprised they haven't banned you even being able to make
[03:15:54.545 --> 03:15:55.425]  You know, real soap.
[03:15:55.425 --> 03:16:00.047]  How dare someone do this and not let us rip everybody off of toxic waste.
[03:16:00.047 --> 03:16:04.629]  I mean, it's such a sick fraud how people pay to be screwed.
[03:16:04.629 --> 03:16:06.729]  How they pay to have a bad deal.
[03:16:06.729 --> 03:16:08.010]  We have to become educated.
[03:16:08.010 --> 03:16:10.291]  We have to become informed and say no.
[03:16:10.291 --> 03:16:20.834]  Let's give out the toll-free number for folks that want to call and get one of the sampler tote bags or for somebody that wants to get a free catalog or go ahead and order a month's supply, a year's supply of soap.
[03:16:20.834 --> 03:16:22.015]  Break that down for folks, Marnie.
[03:16:22.654 --> 03:16:23.234]  1-800-340-7091.
[03:16:23.234 --> 03:16:32.038]  Or look us up on the web, 5starsoap.com.
[03:16:32.038 --> 03:16:35.219]  5 the letter or 5 the number, it makes no difference.
[03:16:35.219 --> 03:16:37.119]  5starsoap.com.
[03:16:37.119 --> 03:16:38.640]  Get a free catalog.
[03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:47.083]  It's a beautiful, detailed information educating you to upgrade your lives from the chemicals that you're getting now.
[03:16:47.083 --> 03:16:49.104]  We have samples, we have
[03:16:49.949 --> 03:16:55.753]  Packages going from one year to five year at the lowest impossible cost.
[03:16:55.753 --> 03:16:56.573]  You won't believe it.
[03:16:56.573 --> 03:16:58.735]  You think this is too good to be true.
[03:16:58.735 --> 03:17:00.996]  It's true and it's good.
[03:17:00.996 --> 03:17:07.320]  And we can verify that with all the Alex Jones families that are enjoying our products.
[03:17:07.320 --> 03:17:07.901]  Absolutely.
[03:17:07.901 --> 03:17:09.022]  5 Star Soap.
[03:17:09.022 --> 03:17:11.003]  Either the letter or spell it out.
[03:17:11.003 --> 03:17:11.903]  5starsoap.com.
[03:17:11.903 --> 03:17:13.805]  Give them that number again, Marty.
[03:17:13.805 --> 03:17:13.845]  800-340-7091.
[03:17:19.053 --> 03:17:23.775]  1-800-340-7091.
[03:17:23.775 --> 03:17:25.876]  My whole family is waiting for your call.
[03:17:25.876 --> 03:17:34.319]  It would be our pleasure to service you, take care of you, save you money, and take you out of coach and put you into first class.
[03:17:34.319 --> 03:17:41.923]  Well, anything to help folks get a good deal and also a socket to the chemical companies that have taken over every facet of life.
[03:17:41.923 --> 03:17:43.783]  Give me a limbrick in closing there.
[03:17:43.783 --> 03:17:45.684]  We always enjoy those, Marty.
[03:17:45.684 --> 03:17:47.185]  Okay, well this is in
[03:17:48.230 --> 03:17:52.233]  Uh, we're doing it with apologies to Irving Berlin.
[03:17:52.233 --> 03:17:57.517]  Blue Cross had me agree to a new Blue Cross policy.
[03:17:57.517 --> 03:18:04.363]  Uh, Blue Cross said I would be thrilled that Blue Cross covered me.
[03:18:04.363 --> 03:18:07.565]  Then I took a fall, leg in a splint.
[03:18:07.565 --> 03:18:10.307]  They said I should read all the fine print.
[03:18:10.307 --> 03:18:15.291]  When a high fever I ran, they said I took out the wrong plan.
[03:18:15.291 --> 03:18:16.652]  Oh, Blue Cross.
[03:18:17.085 --> 03:18:22.690]  There seems to be plenty for Blue Cross and none for me.
[03:18:22.690 --> 03:18:27.554]  Thank you, all you Blue Cross members.
[03:18:27.554 --> 03:18:31.178]  Thank you very, very, very much.
[03:18:31.178 --> 03:18:32.319]  All right.
[03:18:32.319 --> 03:18:34.341]  Marty Schacher, we'll talk to you again next month.
[03:18:34.341 --> 03:18:35.281]  God bless you.
[03:18:35.281 --> 03:18:36.122]  I look forward to it.
[03:18:36.122 --> 03:18:37.704]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:18:37.704 --> 03:18:38.504]  Take care, my friend.
[03:18:38.504 --> 03:18:39.785]  That really is a great guy.
[03:18:39.785 --> 03:18:41.747]  And 62 years doing that.
[03:18:43.820 --> 03:18:48.146]  Just look at how we pay for all these services and then they just give us toxic waste.
[03:18:48.146 --> 03:18:54.614]  Because they'd have to pay to store the sodium fluoride and what's left over when they crack the oil when they refine it.
[03:18:54.614 --> 03:18:57.057]  Just Google the oil refining process.
[03:18:57.057 --> 03:19:00.662]  You can find all these university diagrams from, you know,
[03:19:01.523 --> 03:19:11.429]  Petroleum engineers and science classes, and it'll show you the hundreds of things they make out of oil, out of crude oil, but then there's all these other distillates that are toxic waste.
[03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:13.190]  That is what goes in the soap.
[03:19:13.190 --> 03:19:14.730]  This is not soap.
[03:19:14.730 --> 03:19:16.231]  It's like the Federal Reserve isn't federal.
[03:19:16.231 --> 03:19:18.032]  The Patriot Act isn't a Patriot Act.
[03:19:18.032 --> 03:19:20.754]  When they pull troops out of a country, they call it a build-down.
[03:19:20.754 --> 03:19:24.436]  Everything is a semantical lie with these crooks.
[03:19:24.436 --> 03:19:25.937]  And so we love Marty.
[03:19:25.937 --> 03:19:27.658]  He's a great guy.
[03:19:27.658 --> 03:19:28.658]  FiveStarSoap.com.
[03:19:28.658 --> 03:19:29.819]  Okay, when we come back,
[03:19:31.311 --> 03:19:34.332]  I've got to hurry here, because I've got this state senator coming up.
[03:19:34.332 --> 03:19:46.655]  I want to play this Cobra, the Rise of Cobra video, and just illustrate how you're going to be a superhuman guy if you join the military.
[03:19:46.655 --> 03:19:49.076]  All the symbolism is the Army's white star.
[03:19:49.076 --> 03:19:51.496]  It's a special forces group in the Army.
[03:19:51.496 --> 03:19:53.617]  Join this, kids, and you'll be superhuman.
[03:19:53.617 --> 03:19:59.839]  The truth is, you'll get used up in foreign wars and injected with eugenics vaccines and be treated like crap and ripped off.
[03:19:59.839 --> 03:20:00.279]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.550 --> 03:20:04.631]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:20:04.631 --> 03:20:10.153]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:20:10.153 --> 03:20:15.875]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:20:15.875 --> 03:20:17.356]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:20:17.356 --> 03:20:26.359]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:20:26.679 --> 03:20:28.520]  Now compare a Cal Bend Pure Soap.
[03:20:28.520 --> 03:20:32.722]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[03:20:32.722 --> 03:20:37.745]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[03:20:41.587 --> 03:20:42.668]  Keep it natural.
[03:20:42.668 --> 03:20:51.073]  Call Cal Bend Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[03:20:51.073 --> 03:20:55.255]  Try Cal Bend Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[03:20:55.635 --> 03:21:01.580]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[03:21:01.580 --> 03:21:07.304]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:21:07.304 --> 03:21:08.625]  And we knew what to do.
[03:21:08.625 --> 03:21:10.627]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:21:10.627 --> 03:21:17.652]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:21:17.652 --> 03:21:24.377]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[03:21:25.060 --> 03:21:26.541]  We're safe to breathe.
[03:21:26.541 --> 03:21:33.664]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:21:33.664 --> 03:21:36.826]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:21:36.826 --> 03:21:42.609]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:21:42.609 --> 03:21:45.671]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[03:21:55.708 --> 03:21:57.030]  From a sponsored terror.
[03:21:57.030 --> 03:21:59.533]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:01.990]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[03:22:01.990 --> 03:22:06.952]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[03:22:06.952 --> 03:22:15.015]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[03:22:15.015 --> 03:22:20.597]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[03:22:20.597 --> 03:22:27.559]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[03:22:27.879 --> 03:22:33.462]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[03:22:33.462 --> 03:22:38.545]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[03:22:38.545 --> 03:22:46.490]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[03:22:46.490 --> 03:22:53.054]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[03:22:53.054 --> 03:22:54.175]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:56.892 --> 03:22:57.173]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.239 --> 03:23:05.162]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[03:23:05.162 --> 03:23:12.587]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[03:23:12.587 --> 03:23:14.208]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[03:23:14.208 --> 03:23:18.371]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[03:23:18.371 --> 03:23:22.214]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[03:23:22.214 --> 03:23:26.677]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[03:23:26.677 --> 03:23:30.179]  Phase One is a One World Currency which we are currently being prepared to
[03:23:30.179 --> 03:23:31.580]  We're good to go.
[03:24:04.324 --> 03:24:09.046]  Alright folks, we're going to go right into this video of military propaganda.
[03:24:09.046 --> 03:24:18.771]  Tens of billions of dollars domestically, pushing the image that you need to join the military, it's the thing to do to be a hero, when it isn't our military anymore, it's being used for this empire and bankrupting us.
[03:24:19.651 --> 03:24:27.634]  And then coming up, we're going to get into some of the things that are happening in Mexico as well with a state senator.
[03:24:27.634 --> 03:24:29.215]  But right now, let's go ahead and play.
[03:24:29.215 --> 03:24:30.655]  I mean, it's like every movie now.
[03:24:30.655 --> 03:24:32.156]  It's just amazing.
[03:24:32.156 --> 03:24:36.498]  Transformers, you name it, and they admittedly are getting Pentagon resources.
[03:24:36.498 --> 03:24:37.898]  They approve the script.
[03:24:37.898 --> 03:24:40.539]  This is to get young people to envision themselves.
[03:24:40.539 --> 03:24:41.500]  Think of Cobra Commander.
[03:24:41.500 --> 03:24:42.240]  He lives in a cave.
[03:24:42.240 --> 03:24:43.200]  He's a terrorist.
[03:24:43.200 --> 03:24:44.581]  He's an international financier.
[03:24:44.581 --> 03:24:45.401]  He can never be stopped.
[03:24:45.401 --> 03:24:46.181]  Sounds like Bin Laden.
[03:24:47.702 --> 03:24:52.512]  I mean, Cobra Commander, 20 years ago, was wearing the black ski mask and the uniform that our SWAT teams wear now.
[03:24:52.512 --> 03:24:59.245]  Little kids watch this, and it's predictive programming, is what they call it, to then accept this later in life.
[03:25:00.223 --> 03:25:08.330]  And, you know, the imagery, the white star of the army, you know, calling in the secret unit, these bionic suits they've got, they're superhuman.
[03:25:08.330 --> 03:25:12.953]  This is all glorifying joining the military when this is not our military anymore.
[03:25:12.953 --> 03:25:16.056]  So let's go ahead and play this quick trailer from G.I.
[03:25:16.056 --> 03:25:22.221]  Joe, The Rise of Cobra!
[03:25:22.221 --> 03:25:24.483]  When I'm finished, the world will never forget.
[03:25:31.073 --> 03:25:33.516]  Technically, we don't exist.
[03:25:33.516 --> 03:25:36.258]  We answer to no one.
[03:25:36.258 --> 03:25:40.022]  And when all else fails, we don't.
[03:25:40.022 --> 03:25:42.925]  What did you say your unit was called?
[03:25:42.925 --> 03:25:47.090]  I didn't.
[03:25:47.090 --> 03:25:47.630]  G.I.
[03:25:47.630 --> 03:25:49.913]  Joe The Rise of Cobra.
[03:25:49.913 --> 03:25:50.994]  Coming out this summer.
[03:25:52.765 --> 03:25:54.805]  And you'll just be superhuman in these bionic suits.
[03:25:54.805 --> 03:26:04.227]  And then there's three doors down and, you know, Kid Rock and all these videos, and people have made spoofs of them, showing them before movies.
[03:26:04.227 --> 03:26:07.828]  They're just everywhere, selling people on this image.
[03:26:07.828 --> 03:26:14.549]  And they're hiring aggravated felons, illegal aliens, illegal alien aggravated felons, mercenaries to make up the military.
[03:26:14.549 --> 03:26:15.890]  It's really nightmarish.
[03:26:15.890 --> 03:26:16.970]  This isn't our military anymore.
[03:26:16.970 --> 03:26:19.750]  Just like in Germany, the military wasn't the German people's anymore.
[03:26:19.750 --> 03:26:21.971]  It was under Adolf Hitler's power.
[03:26:23.049 --> 03:26:27.594]  Let's go ahead now and go to the little Kid Rock Warrior piece.
[03:26:27.594 --> 03:26:31.358]  Here it is, folks.
[03:26:31.358 --> 03:26:33.781]  And then we've got a state senator coming up.
[03:26:43.160 --> 03:26:44.521]  Yeah, he's a race car driver.
[03:26:44.521 --> 03:26:45.782]  He's a citizen.
[03:26:45.782 --> 03:26:46.883]  He's in the military.
[03:26:46.883 --> 03:26:48.965]  Just everything cool, man.
[03:26:48.965 --> 03:26:50.687]  NASCAR, rock and roll.
[03:26:50.687 --> 03:26:51.707]  Yeah!
[03:26:51.707 --> 03:26:55.130]  He's gonna fight Al-Qaeda!
[03:26:55.130 --> 03:26:59.734]  Yeah, baby!
[03:26:59.734 --> 03:26:59.854]  Ah!
[03:26:59.854 --> 03:27:03.417]  You jack me with a small poxy and crack shot.
[03:27:03.417 --> 03:27:08.202]  When I shrivel up, put me in a coffin, too.
[03:27:08.202 --> 03:27:11.084]  When I get out of the military, you'll cut my fundus.
[03:27:13.905 --> 03:27:21.849]  When you blow up the chemical jump, chemiseal, and my brain stem rots and I become paralyzed.
[03:27:21.849 --> 03:27:36.016]  You'll tell me to take Prozac, NASCAR, partyin', rock and roll, have some fun, this is cool, oh yeah, oh I'm so tough, oh I'm Kid Rock, oh it's so cool, yeah!
[03:27:37.637 --> 03:27:37.938]  Yeah!
[03:27:37.938 --> 03:27:39.720]  Come on, sucker, idiot kids!
[03:27:39.720 --> 03:27:41.542]  Join the military!
[03:27:41.542 --> 03:27:43.705]  We depleted your radium!
[03:27:43.705 --> 03:27:46.789]  It's just like playing video games!
[03:27:46.789 --> 03:27:49.612]  You'll be able to slaughter them for real!
[03:27:49.612 --> 03:27:55.299]  And when we're done with you... When you do the devil's side, I am the end!
[03:27:55.779 --> 03:27:58.662]  We got a soft kill weapon for you!
[03:27:58.662 --> 03:28:06.990]  Cause we know, after you're done killing for us, you're gonna wake up when we screw you, and you're not gonna like it!
[03:28:06.990 --> 03:28:11.434]  So we're gonna inject you with the cancer viruses, yeah!
[03:28:12.970 --> 03:28:17.733]  Yeah, 1,300,000 dead Iraqis!
[03:28:17.733 --> 03:28:21.155]  But we'll sell you the ammo that we're helping them!
[03:28:21.155 --> 03:28:22.897]  It's so much fun!
[03:28:22.897 --> 03:28:24.678]  It's so good!
[03:28:24.678 --> 03:28:26.139]  Yeah, the world alright!
[03:28:26.139 --> 03:28:28.881]  Yeah!
[03:28:28.881 --> 03:28:35.505]  Meanwhile, we're also training to confiscate your guns door to door!
[03:28:35.505 --> 03:28:35.905]  Yeah!
[03:28:35.905 --> 03:28:37.766]  Let's combat!
[03:28:37.766 --> 03:28:38.747]  Let's party!
[03:28:38.747 --> 03:28:39.107]  Yeah!
[03:28:44.514 --> 03:28:45.615]  Yeah!
[03:28:45.615 --> 03:28:49.758]  You wanna have fun and be a race car driver?
[03:28:49.758 --> 03:28:54.162]  Then just sign up for the military!
[03:28:54.162 --> 03:28:55.964]  Everybody will love you!
[03:28:55.964 --> 03:28:57.605]  You like little kids, don't ya?
[03:28:57.605 --> 03:28:58.886]  Then join the military!
[03:28:58.886 --> 03:29:00.408]  Yeah!
[03:29:00.408 --> 03:29:01.369]  Yeah!
[03:29:01.369 --> 03:29:03.590]  Download this song free.
[03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:06.133]  Go to Yahoo and search National Guard Warrior.
[03:29:08.050 --> 03:29:11.172]  Absolutely, and your tax money paid for that propaganda.
[03:29:11.172 --> 03:29:13.934]  It's everywhere to suck your children in.
[03:29:13.934 --> 03:29:27.242]  Meanwhile, CNN right here, just blew my voice out, money to put kids in prison with set-ups with the judges getting kickbacks to put your children in prison.
[03:29:27.242 --> 03:29:31.325]  That's what's really going on with this criminal government that wants to destroy all the liberties we've got.
[03:29:32.449 --> 03:29:33.309]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:33.309 --> 03:29:40.651]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network simulcasting with the InfoWars Radio Network and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:29:40.651 --> 03:29:41.451]  You found it.
[03:29:41.451 --> 03:29:42.712]  The tip of the spear.
[03:29:42.712 --> 03:29:46.253]  In the InfoWar, we will defeat tyranny!
[03:29:46.253 --> 03:29:49.554]  We swear eternal resistance to tyranny!
[03:29:49.554 --> 03:29:51.974]  Stay with us!
[03:29:51.974 --> 03:29:53.375]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.375 --> 03:29:55.895]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.895 --> 03:29:58.596]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.986 --> 03:30:03.688]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:30:03.688 --> 03:30:05.430]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:30:05.430 --> 03:30:08.113]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:30:08.113 --> 03:30:13.259]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:30:13.259 --> 03:30:16.442]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[03:30:16.442 --> 03:30:19.906]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[03:30:20.327 --> 03:30:32.900]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[03:30:32.900 --> 03:30:34.903]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[03:30:34.903 --> 03:30:36.624]  I use one every day.
[03:30:36.624 --> 03:30:39.027]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[03:30:39.087 --> 03:30:39.827]  I think so.
[03:31:02.086 --> 03:31:08.730]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:31:08.730 --> 03:31:11.371]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:31:11.371 --> 03:31:12.912]  But who is the enemy?
[03:31:12.912 --> 03:31:13.733]  Bin Laden.
[03:31:13.733 --> 03:31:14.673]  This is his ammo.
[03:31:14.673 --> 03:31:16.094]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:31:16.094 --> 03:31:18.075]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:31:18.075 --> 03:31:25.219]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:31:25.219 --> 03:31:25.720]  Some U.S.
[03:31:25.720 --> 03:31:31.343]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:31:32.043 --> 03:31:35.866]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:31:35.866 --> 03:31:38.629]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:32:01.863 --> 03:32:04.804]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[03:32:04.804 --> 03:32:05.924]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[03:32:05.924 --> 03:32:10.125]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[03:32:10.125 --> 03:32:14.927]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function, or are you simply treating the symptoms?
[03:32:14.927 --> 03:32:25.150]  The Sinuplus Elite Advanced Sinus Irrigation System effectively cleanses your sinuses and upper airways of all fungi, bacteria, and pathogens, and clears your sinuses gently and pleasantly.
[03:32:25.270 --> 03:32:25.750]  We're good to go.
[03:32:55.230 --> 03:32:55.631]  I think so.
[03:33:17.782 --> 03:33:19.643]  We are back live.
[03:33:19.643 --> 03:33:30.188]  Upwards of 30 states have now introduced resolutions saying no to gun confiscation, no to martial law, no to Obama's forced compulsory service, no to all of it.
[03:33:30.188 --> 03:33:32.169]  We've been having state reps and state senators on.
[03:33:32.169 --> 03:33:36.031]  We've got Ron Paul lining up next week to talk about it as well.
[03:33:36.031 --> 03:33:36.792]  Very exciting.
[03:33:37.412 --> 03:33:50.618]  We had a state rep on last week from Texas who's introduced 10th Amendment, 9th Amendment resolutions, re-declaring Texas sovereignty, but state Senator Dan Patrick, very influential senator, big history in talk radio, also a best-selling author.
[03:33:50.618 --> 03:33:55.440]  You can go to Patrick.Senate.State.Texas.US or just Google
[03:33:55.840 --> 03:34:00.945]  State Senator, Texas State Senator, Dan Patrick, and find his page and books and all the stuff he's done.
[03:34:00.945 --> 03:34:12.617]  But he's moving to say if the Feds won't protect the border, and it's now collapsing, Mexico in collapse, narco-terrorism, police being killed on both sides, thousands dead, that he's got a plan to actually secure that border.
[03:34:12.617 --> 03:34:17.702]  I remember two years ago, Perry went down there and did some staged events with Homeland Security.
[03:34:17.702 --> 03:34:19.384]  State Senator, it's good to have you here with us.
[03:34:19.966 --> 03:34:28.231]  Hey, Alex, great to be on, and I'm on Facebook, so the easiest place to find me is Dan Patrick on Facebook, and we've got thousands of friends out there, so that's great.
[03:34:28.231 --> 03:34:31.753]  Great to be on with you, appreciate everything you do out there for the cause.
[03:34:31.753 --> 03:34:48.302]  More than ever, Alex, more than ever, we need to be sure we talk about, you know, the history that this nation was founded upon, the Judeo-Christian ethic, the freedoms, because we are rapidly losing them, I mean, day by day, at the hands of the Obama administration.
[03:34:48.746 --> 03:34:54.027]  And quite frankly, you know, I blame it on a lot of my own party for allowing this to happen.
[03:34:54.027 --> 03:35:08.791]  And so the next time that we are back in charge in Washington, of course I serve in Austin, we're going to have to be sure we have the real deal, the real people, not people in name only, who campaign on things they don't believe on.
[03:35:08.791 --> 03:35:12.372]  It's time for real leaders and real believers, because time is running out.
[03:35:13.331 --> 03:35:22.273]  Tell us the situation, I mean, for those around the country listening who don't know how really bad it is in Texas and across the entire contiguous border with Mexico and the Southwest.
[03:35:22.273 --> 03:35:23.253]  What is happening?
[03:35:23.253 --> 03:35:29.034]  I mean, CNN, Wall Street Journal, the Pentagon, Homeland Security say Mexico has a good chance of collapsing.
[03:35:29.034 --> 03:35:34.735]  El Paso Times went out quietly, the National Guard's beefing up down there, preparing to shut the border.
[03:35:34.735 --> 03:35:37.795]  A hundred million people down there during collapse.
[03:35:37.795 --> 03:35:39.356]  Can you break down with the intel?
[03:35:39.356 --> 03:35:40.556]  You've got really what we're facing.
[03:35:40.916 --> 03:35:53.885]  Sure, and let me tell you Alex, I was on Fox last week in the morning and also in the afternoon on one of their new shows and talked about the fact that last Tuesday is the first time in modern history that Texas went on alert.
[03:35:53.885 --> 03:35:59.309]  And until I broke that story, really, in fact, very few people at the Capitol knew it.
[03:35:59.309 --> 03:36:06.074]  And we have a multiple stage, I won't go into too much detail because of Homeland Security, but we have a multiple stage alert process
[03:36:06.773 --> 03:36:11.937]  And we triggered, or the governor triggered, step one of that, to my knowledge.
[03:36:11.937 --> 03:36:15.460]  He may have triggered another step, but I think it was step one.
[03:36:15.460 --> 03:36:19.443]  And the reason was, Alex, we saw for the first time something we had not seen before.
[03:36:19.443 --> 03:36:28.571]  We have 19 border crossings with Mexico and Texas, and in a couple of the key bridges, you saw those people forming on the other side, blocking the bridges.
[03:36:28.571 --> 03:36:32.894]  Well, we didn't know if that crowd of 50 would turn into 500, turn into 5,000, turn into 50,000.
[03:36:32.894 --> 03:36:34.235]  Was this the beginning of the revolution?
[03:36:36.724 --> 03:36:38.665]  Was this the beginning of the takeover?
[03:36:38.665 --> 03:36:40.287]  And if so, we needed to be ready.
[03:36:40.287 --> 03:36:43.889]  So that first stage alert went out.
[03:36:43.889 --> 03:36:52.496]  The plan in Texas, Alex, and I've supported a number of issues for a number of years, even before I got into the legislature, but here's the breakdown.
[03:36:52.496 --> 03:36:54.197]  We have six sectors with Mexico.
[03:36:54.197 --> 03:36:56.779]  Of that 2,000-mile, 1,800-mile border with Mexico,
[03:36:58.427 --> 03:37:00.608]  You know, two-thirds of it in Texas.
[03:37:00.608 --> 03:37:02.628]  And a lot of it is out there in no-man's land.
[03:37:02.628 --> 03:37:14.992]  You get down Del Rio and other places where it's easy to spot people coming across there because they have to come across the river, they have to go over some desert or some pretty sparse area to get up to a freeway or a highway, rather, to get to a city.
[03:37:14.992 --> 03:37:16.733]  That's relatively easy to control.
[03:37:16.733 --> 03:37:19.153]  The key is your big points of entry.
[03:37:19.153 --> 03:37:21.274]  That's where all the illegals are coming in.
[03:37:21.274 --> 03:37:22.575]  That's where we need the fencing.
[03:37:22.575 --> 03:37:26.436]  That's where we need to beef up our border patrol, our
[03:37:27.443 --> 03:37:33.285]  Department of Public Safety, State Troopers, our National Guard, that's what we need to do.
[03:37:33.285 --> 03:37:40.447]  So it's not like we've got to mass troops or personnel along 1,200 miles, 1,400 miles of border.
[03:37:40.447 --> 03:37:48.889]  We simply need to be sure across from El Paso, Laredo, McAllen, Brownsville, and some other key points so we can get this job done.
[03:37:48.889 --> 03:37:54.951]  And if there's a refugee problem, Alex, the refugees need to be in northern Mexico, not southern Texas.
[03:37:55.546 --> 03:37:57.807]  Because there's two possible scenarios that I see.
[03:37:57.807 --> 03:38:09.675]  One is the slow economic meltdown of Mexico, where you just have hundreds of thousands of people, I mean beyond the normal immigration of illegals, coming here out of desperation, you know, just to eat.
[03:38:09.675 --> 03:38:19.601]  And then you have the rapid migration, mass migration, which would happen if Calderon was assassinated, if the drug cartels take over the government like happened in Colombia.
[03:38:19.932 --> 03:38:36.118]  You know, last week, and again, the mainstream news doesn't cover this, Alex, but, you know, last Tuesday, after the bridge closings on the Mexican side, on Wednesday, there was a grenade launcher and a bazooka used to take out eight government officials in Reynoso, which is just south of McAllen.
[03:38:36.118 --> 03:38:43.821]  Well, sir, as you know, the Dallas Morning News talked about car bombs killing people in Dallas, and that's just a tiny blurb.
[03:38:43.821 --> 03:38:46.682]  Rocket attacks on newspapers on the Texas border.
[03:38:47.182 --> 03:38:51.003]  I mean, it used to be a thriving tourist place down there.
[03:38:51.003 --> 03:38:52.443]  I went down there when I was a kid with my parents.
[03:38:52.443 --> 03:39:01.485]  It's all shut down, boarded up now, and I mean, we've already been seeing the collapse of Mexico with these 30 million illegal aliens that have been flooding in the last decade.
[03:39:01.485 --> 03:39:03.905]  But you're talking about a fast collapse.
[03:39:03.905 --> 03:39:08.526]  How bad, from the people studying this, the experts you're talking to, could it get?
[03:39:08.526 --> 03:39:14.487]  Well, you know, I think what is very concerning to me is that
[03:39:15.393 --> 03:39:27.339]  You know, if you talked about this even two years ago, yes, we've seen a mass migration of illegal immigrants into the United States, you know, driven by economic factors, better jobs here, better life here.
[03:39:27.339 --> 03:39:39.064]  But we didn't see that because people in Mexico were running out of fear or literally running because the economy had totally collapsed there.
[03:39:39.064 --> 03:39:44.727]  And so what has happened is, if you just said two years ago could Mexico collapse, people would have laughed.
[03:39:45.513 --> 03:39:50.155]  And I'd like to think that it's not probable, but it's possible.
[03:39:50.155 --> 03:40:08.083]  And the fact that it's possible, Alex, that a country so large, and one of our major trading partners, one of our big oil partners, just a stone's throw across the Rio Grande, that they could collapse, is a major issue for this administration, who I don't think will probably know how to handle it.
[03:40:08.627 --> 03:40:09.589]  And for this country.
[03:40:09.589 --> 03:40:14.937]  So obviously, you know, the question is, what happens if you have millions trying to get here?
[03:40:14.937 --> 03:40:18.082]  You have economic chaos in the United States.
[03:40:18.082 --> 03:40:20.687]  So we've got to be sure they are not allowed to come here.
[03:40:21.664 --> 03:40:26.265]  Well, we already have collapse, as you know, along the border from California to here.
[03:40:26.265 --> 03:40:28.046]  That's already a civil war.
[03:40:28.046 --> 03:40:37.649]  Yeah, it's already a civil war, and so now you're trying to be conservative here and saying, you know, we hope this doesn't happen, and it probably won't happen, but it already is happening.
[03:40:37.649 --> 03:40:46.472]  I've talked to, interviewed all these Texas sheriffs going back five, six years ago, where if they grab a truckload of marijuana or cocaine, the Mexican troops come across the border, put guns in their heads,
[03:40:46.952 --> 03:40:49.434]  And say, we're going to kill you if you don't give that to them.
[03:40:49.434 --> 03:40:55.958]  And then Homeland Security, a year ago, told the National Guard not to fire back when Mexican troops shoot at them.
[03:40:55.958 --> 03:40:58.080]  Yeah, I can't comment.
[03:40:58.080 --> 03:40:58.940]  And I've heard those stories.
[03:40:58.940 --> 03:41:01.302]  I've never been able to confirm them or verify them.
[03:41:01.302 --> 03:41:05.725]  And I'm pretty, you know, strong in that area.
[03:41:05.725 --> 03:41:10.709]  But I will say this to you that just in a week, let me tell you how much has changed in a week.
[03:41:10.709 --> 03:41:12.710]  When I was on Fox television last week,
[03:41:13.460 --> 03:41:23.983]  I made the statement, and I've done a number of radio interviews, telling people in America, if you have kids in college, do not let them, under any circumstance, go to Mexico.
[03:41:23.983 --> 03:41:29.944]  Even the resort towns of Acapulco or Cancun or Cozumel, do not let them go.
[03:41:29.944 --> 03:41:37.006]  I was about to say, Senator, that now the major university organizations today just advise the students not to go.
[03:41:37.006 --> 03:41:37.346]  Right.
[03:41:38.046 --> 03:41:38.786]  Yeah, and that's the problem.
[03:41:38.786 --> 03:41:40.587]  You don't know where to turn to for justice.
[03:41:40.587 --> 03:41:45.090]  About a month ago, the person in the Calderon government who was in charge of the anti-kidnapping squad
[03:42:07.839 --> 03:42:12.301]  Uh, was arrested because he was taking bribes of $450,000 a month.
[03:42:12.301 --> 03:42:15.083]  And he was head of the anti-kidnapping charge.
[03:42:15.083 --> 03:42:26.689]  There was a scheduler who knew the whereabouts of Calderon, um, who supposedly was being paid $100,000 a month just to keep the whereabouts of the president known to some of the drug cartels.
[03:42:26.689 --> 03:42:32.792]  Um, this, I mean, this is an explosive situation that most likely will get worse before it gets better.
[03:42:32.792 --> 03:42:34.133]  Car bombs.
[03:42:34.133 --> 03:42:36.894]  I mean, a high level assault on government.
[03:42:37.661 --> 03:42:50.590]  And I think that the big question that the Calderon government will have to resolve, and the Obama administration, will we send American troops into Mexico at some point to help the Mexican government?
[03:42:50.590 --> 03:42:52.031]  We had to do it twice before.
[03:42:52.031 --> 03:43:03.159]  And so far the Mexican government has not wanted the troops, and obviously our troops are stretched thin, and you don't want to be in the middle of that type of war.
[03:43:03.720 --> 03:43:09.164]  But look, here's the good news, if there's good news out of here.
[03:43:09.164 --> 03:43:19.932]  The reason we've seen an escalation of violence and really civil war along the northern border is because when Vincente Fox was president, he did basically nothing in terms of drug law enforcement.
[03:43:19.932 --> 03:43:22.554]  When Calderon came in, he came in and he had his 45,000 soldiers.
[03:43:24.039 --> 03:43:24.279]  I don't
[03:43:42.918 --> 03:43:47.899]  The situation has to be watched closely by those of us in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California.
[03:43:47.899 --> 03:43:54.060]  Well, Senator Patrick, let me throw this in on the six minutes we have left with your seven minutes, because we don't have much time here.
[03:43:54.060 --> 03:43:59.342]  Specifically, though, you've been on TV talking about if the feds won't protect the border, the state needs to do it.
[03:43:59.342 --> 03:44:00.662]  Can you speak to that?
[03:44:00.662 --> 03:44:07.843]  Yeah, well, actually, when I ran for office, I'm serving my second session, and when I ran back in 2005, I made the point that
[03:44:11.340 --> 03:44:13.241]  Yes, it's the federal government's responsibility.
[03:44:13.241 --> 03:44:15.002]  That's what my opponents kept saying.
[03:44:15.002 --> 03:44:19.204]  I said, that is true, but it's Texas' problem, and we're going to have to solve it.
[03:44:19.204 --> 03:44:26.948]  And I believe Governor Perry has the will, and I believe others of us have the will in Texas, that if the federal government does not react, we must react.
[03:44:26.948 --> 03:44:27.988]  Okay, what is that plan?
[03:44:27.988 --> 03:44:29.569]  I mean, do you put the state police in there?
[03:44:29.569 --> 03:44:30.510]  Do you do emergency funding?
[03:44:30.510 --> 03:44:33.111]  Well, as I mentioned before, it's a series of, it's a number of plans.
[03:44:37.423 --> 03:44:42.186]  You've got to send more aid to the county sheriffs who are on the, they're the frontline battle guys.
[03:44:42.186 --> 03:44:46.728]  Secondly, you've got to work in border patrol and, and... What about a Texas fence?
[03:44:46.728 --> 03:44:48.149]  What about a Texas fence?
[03:44:48.149 --> 03:44:56.374]  Well, as I said a moment ago, it is a waste of resources to put a fence out in the middle of no man's land, because God has given us a natural fence called the Rio Grande.
[03:44:56.374 --> 03:44:57.835]  But what about in the key areas?
[03:44:57.835 --> 03:45:00.696]  But, but in the key areas, that's where we need it.
[03:45:00.696 --> 03:45:05.039]  Now, 90% of the land on the border is Texas land, so we have a lot of authority there.
[03:45:06.579 --> 03:45:16.243]  There are some constitutional provisions that we have to be careful of, but at the end of the day, we have the Texas State Guard, several thousand strong, which could grow quickly.
[03:45:16.243 --> 03:45:18.624]  I think volunteers would step up very quickly.
[03:45:18.624 --> 03:45:21.086]  We have the National Guard that the governor can call out.
[03:45:21.086 --> 03:45:23.507]  We have a large state police force.
[03:45:23.507 --> 03:45:28.409]  We have our game wardens, we have our DPS, and all working in concert with the Border Patrol.
[03:45:28.409 --> 03:45:30.030]  But you can't tie their hands!
[03:45:30.030 --> 03:45:32.331]  I believe if we made it a major priority
[03:45:34.795 --> 03:45:38.557]  To ratchet up our level of boots on the ground.
[03:45:38.557 --> 03:45:42.099]  Every time we put boots on the ground, we see illegal immigration go down dramatically.
[03:45:42.099 --> 03:45:48.342]  But Senator, from what you've said, we need to put them there now because it could collapse any day, any month, any year.
[03:45:48.342 --> 03:45:56.746]  We're already seeing a collapse, so are you moving now to go ahead and draw up the plan while it's in session, perfect timing, and get the forces down there we need?
[03:45:56.746 --> 03:46:02.829]  Well, the plan is to be drawn up by the Homeland Security Director and with the Governor's oversight.
[03:46:03.569 --> 03:46:04.630]  Thank you, sir.
[03:46:19.473 --> 03:46:22.959]  I mean relatively quickly in the worst-case scenario.
[03:46:22.959 --> 03:46:31.472]  So I am confident that in a worst-case scenario, we'll be ready to meet that challenge.
[03:46:31.472 --> 03:46:33.796]  I'm also confident that we're taking the right steps we need now.
[03:46:34.375 --> 03:46:39.439]  Senator Patrick, the big issue here is we can't tie the hands of the police if they're down there being shot at.
[03:46:39.439 --> 03:46:46.885]  They need to open up on the... These are real terrorists, not the little ones sneaking around underneath the desks that the government's taking all our liberties to fight.
[03:46:46.885 --> 03:46:48.026]  This is real terrorism.
[03:46:48.026 --> 03:46:51.168]  They're killing police citizens, kidnapping Americans.
[03:46:51.168 --> 03:46:53.811]  I mean, we need to move heavy assets down there.
[03:46:54.571 --> 03:46:56.032]  Mexico's attacked us repeatedly.
[03:46:56.032 --> 03:47:05.861]  They attacked us during World War I. I'm not saying the government's doing this now, but I'm sorry to say the people down there, and especially the leadership, they hate this country.
[03:47:05.861 --> 03:47:07.443]  I know you know about the plan of San Diego.
[03:47:07.443 --> 03:47:12.507]  The German tried to launch attacks and gave the orders in World War II.
[03:47:12.507 --> 03:47:14.729]  I mean, this is a country that hates our guts.
[03:47:14.729 --> 03:47:18.753]  And I'm saying if Mexico wants to start something, I'm talking about their drug gangs, we need to wipe them out.
[03:47:19.656 --> 03:47:29.084]  Well, I think the biggest concern that most of us here have, Democrats, Republicans alike, and I'm a conservative Reagan Republican, but I think it's across the aisle.
[03:47:29.084 --> 03:47:40.213]  All of us are concerned about the transnational gangs and the violence of these gangs ratcheting up in America to where it has in Mexico.
[03:47:40.213 --> 03:47:43.035]  And also the violence just spilling over on the border.
[03:47:43.035 --> 03:47:48.199]  You know, a lot of the police officials, a lot of the executives, a lot of the government officials who actually
[03:47:48.772 --> 03:47:52.013]  Work in Mexico, live across the border in Texas.
[03:47:52.013 --> 03:47:53.813]  Sir, that's my final question.
[03:47:53.813 --> 03:47:55.594]  That's my final, yeah, they're afraid they live here.
[03:47:55.594 --> 03:47:59.535]  That's what I'm saying here is that they target police, they target military.
[03:47:59.535 --> 03:48:02.756]  So, you know, they say take money or we'll kill you.
[03:48:02.756 --> 03:48:06.097]  This is already spilling over into Texas and California.
[03:48:06.097 --> 03:48:08.878]  Well, we definitely have seen some of it, but we have not.
[03:48:08.878 --> 03:48:15.540]  For example, in Juarez and Ciudad Juarez, I mean, across from El Paso, there were 1,600 murders in Juarez.
[03:48:17.202 --> 03:48:18.023]  We're good to go.
[03:48:36.423 --> 03:48:36.703]  I think so.
[03:48:52.088 --> 03:48:53.049]  I'm for drug decriminalization.
[03:48:53.049 --> 03:48:53.569]  If that happened
[03:49:17.111 --> 03:49:20.652]  These drug gangs, we start trying to murder politicians that try to decriminalize.
[03:49:20.652 --> 03:49:26.654]  If we decriminalize, not legalize, that would end the $400 million profit that is funding these people.
[03:49:26.654 --> 03:49:44.738]  Well, I know in Mexico, supposedly their government is looking at that, and in closing, let me just say once again, Alex, I appreciate your focus on this, and also I invite people to go to my Facebook page, Dan Patrick, be my friend, and we keep in touch with what's going on on a regular basis.
[03:49:45.325 --> 03:49:49.787]  And lastly, I'd like to share and take 10 seconds.
[03:49:49.787 --> 03:49:53.869]  We have an award-winning documentary that we have done, which is an incredible story.
[03:49:53.869 --> 03:49:56.070]  It's a true story about Texas.
[03:49:56.070 --> 03:49:59.931]  And it has sold thousands and thousands of copies.
[03:49:59.931 --> 03:50:01.812]  It's called The Heart of Texas.
[03:50:01.812 --> 03:50:07.174]  And if you go to Heart of Texas, the movie, I was the executive producer of The Heart of Texas, themovie.com.
[03:50:07.174 --> 03:50:08.995]  It's a Christian film.
[03:50:08.995 --> 03:50:12.977]  It's a Christian film, but it's a film about
[03:50:13.433 --> 03:50:14.055]  What do you think?
[03:50:23.502 --> 03:50:25.764]  And I think you'll be on the air saying, folks, you've got to see this.
[03:50:53.722 --> 03:50:54.544]  That's what's really going on.
[03:50:54.544 --> 03:50:54.844]  Stay with us.
[03:51:02.310 --> 03:51:05.832]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:51:05.832 --> 03:51:11.234]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:51:11.234 --> 03:51:16.397]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:51:16.397 --> 03:51:27.502]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[03:51:27.902 --> 03:51:33.686]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:51:33.686 --> 03:51:39.949]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:51:39.949 --> 03:51:40.990]  What about you?
[03:51:40.990 --> 03:51:47.434]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[03:52:03.397 --> 03:52:06.218]  A new world order.
[03:52:06.218 --> 03:52:10.718]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:52:10.718 --> 03:52:13.939]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:52:13.939 --> 03:52:16.720]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:52:16.720 --> 03:52:19.120]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:52:19.904 --> 03:52:27.234]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:52:30.253 --> 03:52:35.697]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:52:35.697 --> 03:52:39.559]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:52:39.559 --> 03:52:42.141]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:52:42.141 --> 03:52:43.302]  Most people have no idea.
[03:52:43.302 --> 03:52:44.082]  They're not after money.
[03:52:44.082 --> 03:52:45.363]  They have all the money they need.
[03:52:45.363 --> 03:52:46.344]  They're after power.
[03:52:46.344 --> 03:52:47.485]  That's what they're after.
[03:52:47.485 --> 03:52:56.210]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.210 --> 03:52:59.012]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:52:59.012 --> 03:53:00.133]  You have been warned.
[03:53:03.154 --> 03:53:07.655]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[03:53:07.655 --> 03:53:11.016]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.
[03:53:11.016 --> 03:53:15.877]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, and I've been solving tax debt problems for 30 years, and I can help you too.
[03:53:15.877 --> 03:53:20.498]  We can stabilize IRS collection action and get your tax debt reduced, sometimes completely eliminated.
[03:53:21.061 --> 03:53:32.577]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[03:53:32.898 --> 03:53:36.200]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.
[03:53:36.200 --> 03:53:39.441]  Call 1-800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:53:39.441 --> 03:53:42.763]  That's 800-34-N-O-T-A-X.
[03:53:42.763 --> 03:53:45.885]  Or go to my website at TaxHelpOnline.com.
[03:53:45.885 --> 03:53:51.187]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades, and he can help you.
[03:53:51.187 --> 03:53:52.168]  Call us today, 800-346-6829.
[03:53:52.168 --> 03:53:52.548]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:54:07.728 --> 03:54:10.248]  Yeah, folks.
[03:54:10.248 --> 03:54:25.331]  The CIA and the big money laundering banks, we told you this year before it happened, from selling Estello and other contacts from the DEA, is going to try to take down four major and a few sub-cartels that weren't paying their cut to the central banks, just like the U.S.
[03:54:25.331 --> 03:54:29.272]  military invaded Colombia over the FARC not paying their cut.
[03:54:29.272 --> 03:54:33.673]  And the drug gangs are fighting back because they're not cowards.
[03:54:33.673 --> 03:54:34.333]  But, uh,
[03:54:35.560 --> 03:54:38.542]  The media covers up the dead cops and citizens here in the U.S.
[03:54:38.542 --> 03:54:40.823]  It's much worse than you were even hearing.
[03:54:40.823 --> 03:54:44.765]  And the SPP, North American Union, talks about Mexico collapsing and using that.
[03:54:44.765 --> 03:54:47.066]  Calderon was put in there to do this.
[03:54:47.066 --> 03:54:48.407]  And we're not just saying that today.
[03:54:48.407 --> 03:54:50.148]  We said that years ago.
[03:54:50.888 --> 03:54:52.308]  We said that as Fox was leaving.
[03:54:52.308 --> 03:54:53.488]  This is the plan.
[03:54:53.488 --> 03:54:55.389]  Crises, order out of chaos.
[03:54:55.389 --> 03:54:57.409]  I want to hit this story about taking blood from children.
[03:54:57.409 --> 03:54:59.750]  I'm going to get some guests on about that.
[03:54:59.750 --> 03:55:06.231]  But before we go any further, I wanted to briefly just tell you about one of our great sponsors at ColaBlue.com.
[03:55:06.231 --> 03:55:07.691]  Fabulous atmospheric water generator.
[03:55:07.691 --> 03:55:10.452]  It's like a water cooler that has hot and cold water, seven filters.
[03:55:10.452 --> 03:55:13.712]  It goes through, but no water or no water bottle attached to it.
[03:55:13.712 --> 03:55:15.452]  And I show this to people and they can't believe it.
[03:55:15.452 --> 03:55:17.913]  The air you're in is filled with water.
[03:55:18.732 --> 03:55:27.988]  And it doesn't come out of a, you know, city utility system that's full of mercury and lead and sodium fluoride and chlorine and all the dead bacteria.
[03:55:27.988 --> 03:55:29.590]  Because, you know, it just kills the bacteria.
[03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:31.614]  You're eating all those dead bacteria and other particulate.
[03:55:33.342 --> 03:55:34.463]  So give Ecolablue a call.
[03:55:34.463 --> 03:55:35.424]  It's just a fabulous system.
[03:55:35.424 --> 03:55:35.484]  800-691-6043.
[03:55:35.484 --> 03:55:35.844]  800-691-6043 is the number.
[03:55:35.844 --> 03:55:36.205]  Ecolablue.com.
[03:55:36.205 --> 03:55:36.345]  1-800-691-6043.
[03:55:36.345 --> 03:55:37.426]  For survival, just for clean water.
[03:55:37.426 --> 03:55:38.407]  Guaranteed no fluoride in this, baby.
[03:55:38.407 --> 03:55:40.188]  I mean, this is just fabulous water.
[03:55:40.188 --> 03:55:40.889]  I drink it constantly.
[03:55:40.889 --> 03:55:43.171]  In fact, I need to fill my glass back up.
[03:55:43.171 --> 03:55:43.571]  Ecolablue.com.
[03:55:56.257 --> 03:56:00.178]  Alright, I keep mentioning this the last two days, but I haven't really gotten into it, and I need to.
[03:56:00.178 --> 03:56:04.619]  So I'm going to try to remember, guys, tomorrow to spend 20 minutes on this.
[03:56:04.619 --> 03:56:05.840]  But it's just so important.
[03:56:05.840 --> 03:56:09.281]  Texans unknowingly donate children's blood to research.
[03:56:09.281 --> 03:56:12.681]  And this Austin American Statesman story itself is a whitewash.
[03:56:12.681 --> 03:56:18.203]  Medical privacy advocates, ethicists say parents should be asked for consent before newborn screening samples are kept.
[03:56:18.203 --> 03:56:21.744]  They lie and say it's a state law, like they lie and say taking vaccines is a state law.
[03:56:22.284 --> 03:56:28.870]  And they take your baby's blood for a blood test, but with the health department set up under eugenics instead of the hospital doing the test.
[03:56:28.870 --> 03:56:35.576]  And it goes into a federal database and is sold to international companies who isolate proteins and DNA and then patent it.
[03:56:35.576 --> 03:56:39.339]  And then there's been federal cases where they say they own your blood and you want to get a gene therapy.
[03:56:39.339 --> 03:56:41.481]  This company has your genes already sequenced.
[03:56:41.481 --> 03:56:46.286]  It goes through the registry and they say, you know, you got to pay us all this money to be able to have your own gene therapy.
[03:56:47.574 --> 03:56:56.119]  For almost seven years, and another lie, it's 36, the state has identified storing blood from nearly all newborns in Texas without their parents' consent for possible use in medical research.
[03:56:56.119 --> 03:56:58.340]  It's not possible use, it's being done.
[03:56:58.340 --> 03:57:00.722]  The blood is, remember, I'm telling you this for 13 years.
[03:57:00.722 --> 03:57:03.383]  The blood is collected as part of a 44-year-old state mandate.
[03:57:03.383 --> 03:57:04.784]  So see, they're saying 44.
[03:57:04.784 --> 03:57:06.645]  First it's 7, then it's 44.
[03:57:06.645 --> 03:57:08.386]  I've confirmed, globally, 36 years.
[03:57:10.478 --> 03:57:11.999]  How many years did I tell you that?
[03:57:11.999 --> 03:57:13.841]  I showed you government documents.
[03:57:13.841 --> 03:57:20.807]  The blood is collected as part of a 44-year-old state mandate newborn screening program in which hospitals, birthing centers, and midwives draw blood from a bad baby's CLC.
[03:57:20.807 --> 03:57:23.289]  It's not law, it's mandated.
[03:57:25.523 --> 03:57:28.446]  The state either discards the blood after six months, total lie.
[03:57:28.446 --> 03:57:30.468]  They store it in Michigan and San Antonio.
[03:57:30.468 --> 03:57:33.090]  Or more recently, store it for three years before destroying it.
[03:57:33.090 --> 03:57:34.252]  Another lie.
[03:57:34.252 --> 03:57:38.836]  I'm not saying this Marianne Roser is bad, she just doesn't know what she's talking about.
[03:57:38.836 --> 03:57:46.424]  But starting in 2002, the State Health Department began collecting and keeping blood indefinitely for current or future medical research, a practice that has been the subject of a legal challenge in Minnesota.
[03:57:46.424 --> 03:57:48.966]  We had those people on fighting it last year.
[03:57:49.927 --> 03:57:51.668]  Five dots of blood are collected on paper.
[03:57:51.668 --> 03:57:56.970]  No, they take ampoules out of the baby seal, folks, not just the five dots, and are collected on paper for screening and then stored.
[03:57:56.970 --> 03:58:03.973]  Under the Health Department's policy, the samples can be used for medical community, for things like cancer research, birth defect studies, and calibration of lab equipment.
[03:58:03.973 --> 03:58:09.816]  Now, they're using it for a DNA database on you, and it's popping up with insurance refusing people coverage.
[03:58:09.816 --> 03:58:11.517]  We are out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:58:13.089 --> 03:58:14.911]  But I will be back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:58:14.911 --> 03:58:15.551]  to 3 p.m.
[03:58:15.551 --> 03:58:24.218]  This show grows when you spread the word about the free podcast, about the AM and FM affiliates, all our great stations, about how you can listen on the shortwave, and we had Dr. Edwin Vieira on.
[03:58:24.218 --> 03:58:35.187]  I covered a lot of other news in the start of the show, so powerful info coming up right now as we start retransmission at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:58:35.187 --> 03:58:38.790]  Great job to the crew and the producers, Rob and Joey.
[03:58:38.790 --> 03:58:39.450]  God bless you all.
[03:58:39.450 --> 03:58:40.411]  We'll see you back live tomorrow.
[03:58:40.411 --> 03:58:40.731]  Stay with us.
[03:58:40.731 --> 03:58:41.512]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[03:58:43.683 --> 03:58:46.285]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:51.891 --> 03:58:52.511]  Hello, friends.

[03:58:53.572 --> 03:58:58.317]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.317 --> 03:59:01.280]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.280 --> 03:59:04.323]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.323 --> 03:59:09.027]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:09.267 --> 03:59:10.388]  If you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.388 --> 03:59:13.630]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.630 --> 03:59:20.615]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
