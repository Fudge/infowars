[00:00:02.117 --> 00:00:04.300]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.683]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:15.610]  So much is happening on the Freedom Front.
[00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:22.275]  We had Charlie Sheen on Sunday announcing the winner of 20 Minutes with the President, the video contest exposing 9-11 truth.
[00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:26.839]  Jesse Mattura was on Larry King Live talking about 9-11 being an inside job last night.
[00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.262]  His new TV show set to premiere tomorrow night, 10 p.m.
[00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.303]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:33.523]  Central on TruTV.
[00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:39.456]  Everywhere people are talking about global government and the New World Order.
[00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:44.338]  There is a ultra-massive awakening taking place across the globe.
[00:00:44.818 --> 00:00:56.563]  Now, nine days ago, I put out a video release breaking down the basics of ClimateGate, the head UN climate center.
[00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:58.924]  Insiders leaped.
[00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:08.819]  Thousands of emails, hundreds of documents, the computer code with notes by the computer programmers in the code about here's how we carry out the fraud, the earth is getting colder.
[00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:11.414]  Here's how you fool the data.
[00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:14.095]  Here's how you hide the decline, as we've been ordered to do.
[00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:15.975]  They gave it to other countries.
[00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:19.656]  Now New Zealand has been caught manipulating their numbers to fit.
[00:01:20.376 --> 00:01:27.578]  Now we have the official United Nations documents that are in an article written by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:28.538]  Bombshell.
[00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:31.499]  UN documents outline plan to use climate gate crooks
[00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:40.394]  And in run around national sovereignty and in here they talk about how to go out and politically get control of all the scientists.
[00:01:40.414 --> 00:01:41.155]  This was years ago.
[00:01:42.742 --> 00:02:02.471]  How to get them on the payroll for world government, how this is world communism, how it's meant to shut down freedom, how they've got to do this by stealth, that it's to set it up so the UN can make all the world rules and make all the laws, the UN itself, a private holding company for private central banks engaged in a private corporate takeover of the planet.
[00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:12.055]  This article is so important and then secondarily in the UN documents that have just now surfaced, that the UN admits are theirs.
[00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.371]  This is all admitted.
[00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:34.883]  They talk about how to take over your children, and then we see Al Gore giving speeches to elementary kids about, don't listen to your parents, you teach them that the earth is dying, we've got to have the tax, he's all over TV promoting it, he's in dramas, sitcoms, the news, it comes out the government's paying for this, this is hardcore program that's worse than the Soviet Union.
[00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:39.826]  I mean, at least there they admitted they were doing it, here they try to hide it, but it is publicly available.
[00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:42.988]  So that's going on, it's kind of a public secret.
[00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:56.492]  We have the New York Times bragging how kids are trained 7th graders to come home and tell their mom you can't have a hot bath and to write them climate tickets and bring it back to their teachers and report on them.
[00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:04.126]  We already knew this was being implemented globally because it's the same programs everywhere, but now we have the internal UN documents.
[00:03:04.727 --> 00:03:26.304]  It is up to the viewers and the listeners of this radio slash TV transmission, just like you helped drive Climategate out like no one else, and it's up to all the activist sites, the libertarians, conservatives, true liberals, people that want freedom, people that are shattering the left-right paradigm that want justice, to get this latest UN World Governmentgate
[00:03:27.998 --> 00:03:28.278]  U.N.
[00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:30.460]  takeover of the children gate.
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.140]  You know, U.N.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.921]  children gate?
[00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.101]  Hell, the U.N.'
[00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:34.983]  's always caught running child kidnapping rings.
[00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:37.104]  I'm not talking about that child kidnapping gate.
[00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:43.388]  But this child takeover, this brainwashing gate from Australia to Canada to England to the U.S.
[00:03:43.668 --> 00:03:44.289]  to Germany.
[00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:46.170]  It's global to Japan.
[00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:48.596]  We are under global management.
[00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:50.277]  They're just admitting the world government now.
[00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:56.298]  Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com joining us from Hawaii via video Skype.
[00:03:57.218 --> 00:04:00.179]  Mike, I mean the magnitude of these documents.
[00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:10.581]  First I want to get your take on how we helped push this out to everyone to show how the UN and their own documents is talking about how they recruited scientists to fix the data.
[00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:16.442]  This completes the circuit of fraud from NASA and the US government to the UN to England.
[00:04:17.422 --> 00:04:20.167]  And so, A, how do we get this out?
[00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:28.339]  B, your take on Climategate and these latest revelations, as just like with Watergate or something, the deeper we dig, the worse it gets.
[00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:35.670]  Yeah, it is absolutely a monumental scandal right now and it is important to get all of this information out there.
[00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.774]  It is important to get to people who normally do not get their news off the internet and get this to them as well.
[00:04:42.054 --> 00:04:43.815]  We're in an absolute war.
[00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:45.716]  It is an information war right now.
[00:04:45.956 --> 00:04:53.901]  The corporate media with the exception of Fox News and a couple of individual organizations like Wall Street Journal is covering this with a great deal of
[00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:55.302]  Fairness and objectivity.
[00:04:55.523 --> 00:04:59.968]  But for the most part, the corporate media is still trying as hard as they can to put a lid on this.
[00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:00.929]  They're still trying to sell.
[00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.571]  Copenhagen is a good thing.
[00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:04.113]  They're trying to get this through.
[00:05:04.293 --> 00:05:05.154]  It's a bum's rush.
[00:05:05.174 --> 00:05:09.720]  They're trying to get it done as fast as they can before the rest of the world wakes up to what's going on.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:21.163]  And just talking to everybody, posting everywhere, flood the net, call your newspapers, just get in their faces and let them know you know there's a huge monumental fraud going on here.
[00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:31.566]  Now with regard to ClimateGate, the global warming hoax, if you will, was one of three pillars on which this push for global government was built.
[00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:33.467]  The other two were Swine11, the
[00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:39.569]  Phony global pandemic, which hasn't really worked out, and of course the global financial crisis.
[00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.551]  So right now the global government agenda is in serious, serious trouble.
[00:05:44.271 --> 00:05:58.577]  They see this fight over Climategate as possibly being the final battle, because if the global warming hoax becomes exposed to the whole public, and that pillar collapses, then the whole global government agenda is going to start unraveling and coming apart.
[00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:03.341]  Now, the thing I've been telling my listeners and my readers over at my website is really very simple.
[00:06:04.362 --> 00:06:12.950]  For everybody who ever said, oh, the government doesn't engage in such massive conspiracies, you've got one right in front of you, staked out for all the world to see.
[00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:14.672]  And after you look at this with
[00:06:15.072 --> 00:06:18.234]  Government, the media, and it wasn't just Hadley CRU.
[00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:21.176]  New Zealand's Climate Research Center has been compromised.
[00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:24.278]  NOAA has been caught fudging their data.
[00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:31.763]  It is truly a massive conspiracy to trick the people of the world into accepting the yoke of global taxation and global government.
[00:06:32.103 --> 00:06:35.285]  Look at this and then ask, what else have they been lying to us about?
[00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:41.469]  And more importantly, if they get away with it this time, what else will they lie to us about in the future?
[00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:53.698]  And Mike, expanding on a point you just made, there's all these famous FBI hidden video clips of the mafia in New York and New Jersey and Illinois.
[00:06:54.747 --> 00:07:06.371]  Meeting around pool tables or in bars, talking about murders they've committed, talking about whores they're running, talking about drugs they're bringing in, talking about cops and judges they're buying.
[00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:16.194]  We have that with the ClimateGate emails and the computer program, with the notes, for those that don't know computer programs, if there's glitches in them,
[00:07:17.034 --> 00:07:18.195]  Or designed fraud.
[00:07:18.215 --> 00:07:25.581]  They'll be internal manuals, just like Diebold got caught with the programs, with internal messages to how to manipulate things.
[00:07:26.101 --> 00:07:39.651]  They have been caught in spades, red-handed, across the board, in premeditated fraud from the head UN climate change facility that they chose, who would announce the bench line fraud
[00:07:40.692 --> 00:07:47.499]  And then everyone else in UN-controlled academia would then line up and parrot that and fix their data along with it.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:54.126]  And now we have the latest UN documents where they're talking about fixing the data with all the regional groups.
[00:07:54.547 --> 00:08:01.134]  I mean, this is a giant 30-year takeover program that is now blowing up before our eyes.
[00:08:01.794 --> 00:08:02.996]  And this is beautiful.
[00:08:03.837 --> 00:08:04.798]  Yeah, it absolutely is.
[00:08:04.978 --> 00:08:11.622]  This is Mother Nature telling Al Gore, booga booga, because obviously the Earth has been cooling for the last nine to ten years.
[00:08:12.042 --> 00:08:22.249]  It forces them to talk about hiding the decline, because if you think about what is really invested, I mean, look at all the people who have put their own personal fortunes into these new green industries.
[00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.731]  Al Gore is heavily invested in his brokerage.
[00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:29.794]  Obama is hooked in with this Chicago Climate Exchange operation.
[00:08:30.014 --> 00:08:31.535]  They've all put their money into it.
[00:08:31.635 --> 00:08:32.916]  It's the new big money maker.
[00:08:33.176 --> 00:08:34.897]  Plus, you've got the global government agenda.
[00:08:35.117 --> 00:08:42.542]  There are trillions of dollars on the line here, and they're seeing it all blow up in front of their faces just because the Earth happened to get cooler.
[00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:49.406]  Well, these people didn't become rich and powerful by letting a little thing like the truth get in their way, so they're out there just trying to propagandize this thing.
[00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:57.051]  They're already out there spinning, saying, well, okay, we caught a few bad scientists, but we have all this other data which says what we want it to say here.
[00:08:57.251 --> 00:09:05.656]  But common sense has to tell you, if you have ten reports that all say the same thing, and one is a proven fraud, then the other nine are going to be a fraud as well.
[00:09:06.056 --> 00:09:24.731]  And then we have the latest UN document, internal document, not for publication, which the UN confirms has now been released, where they're going back over the last few years, getting all their scientists lined up, recruiting them like secret agents to be part of this political takeover for global governance.
[00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:26.713]  We have them red-handed.
[00:09:27.373 --> 00:09:30.935]  Yes, we absolutely do, and people should be very, very angry about this.
[00:09:31.356 --> 00:09:40.862]  Not only because of the push for global enslavement, because when you talk about taking taxes away from people on the basis of a hoax and giving nothing back, that's slavery!
[00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:46.546]  I mean, they're going to be in there raking in the trillions of dollars in carbon taxes and saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're saving you from global warming.
[00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:48.407]  Give me the money, we're saving you from global warming here.
[00:09:48.807 --> 00:09:51.350]  It's a hoax, and that is a form of enslavement.
[00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.336]  It is a covert form of enslavement, but it is still planetary enslavement.
[00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:57.837]  That's what they're trying to do.
[00:09:58.378 --> 00:10:00.540]  And people should be furious about this.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.543]  Right now, anger is the appropriate survival response.
[00:10:04.384 --> 00:10:09.129]  And I just want to point out to everybody that we've been right about this all along.
[00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:21.199]  We have been here telling the truth that it was a fraud, that it was for global government, that it was a way to wage war against humanity, it was a way to give us carbon credits with national ID cards to track everything we were saying and doing.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.122]  And we were only going off their own documents.
[00:10:24.663 --> 00:10:31.048]  Now they're caught out in the open because now they're to the point of where they can't deny it anymore because they're openly taking over.
[00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:37.154]  And right at their weak point, when they were going from denying it to admitting it, this blows up in their face.
[00:10:37.614 --> 00:10:42.159]  And more and more the evidence shows, and mainstream media is reporting this as you mentioned,
[00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:57.189]  That the British government said, oh, this was a hack so that they could try to cloud the providence of these internal documents and emails and block it from being admissible in court.
[00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:58.852]  But now it's coming out.
[00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:16.848]  That the scientists admit it is their emails, it is their documents, and that in the emails there are other scientists, junior scientists in these universities saying, this is illegal, we shouldn't be doing this, and that it's those scientists that leaked this because there was just the Fourier request a few months ago.
[00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:21.690]  That was criminally blocked with the British government and the University of East Anglia.
[00:11:21.971 --> 00:11:24.591]  And so people said, I'm not going to engage in fraud for you.
[00:11:25.052 --> 00:11:26.632]  And that this was given to the police.
[00:11:26.932 --> 00:11:32.594]  This was given to the BBC six weeks ago, seven weeks ago now, and they criminally blocked it.
[00:11:32.854 --> 00:11:36.876]  So now the conspiracy of fraud is getting bigger.
[00:11:37.136 --> 00:11:40.457]  And as the criminals try to cover it up, the charges are racking up.
[00:11:41.787 --> 00:11:43.327]  And it's becoming very obvious.
[00:11:43.407 --> 00:11:49.469]  I mean, we used to say, the fastest way to expose a dictator, make them act like one in public, they're doing it right now.
[00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:56.751]  Yeah, what about the UN saying, if you criticize man-made global warming as media, you can't come to the Copenhagen event.
[00:11:57.051 --> 00:11:58.832]  Only if you agree can you come.
[00:11:59.272 --> 00:11:59.492]  Ha!
[00:11:59.632 --> 00:12:00.352]  We'll be right back.

[00:13:03.451 --> 00:13:04.492]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:13:04.892 --> 00:13:10.356]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:13:10.936 --> 00:13:11.436]  That's right.
[00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:14.038]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:13:14.358 --> 00:13:21.523]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:13:22.083 --> 00:13:29.766]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:13:30.206 --> 00:13:35.068]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:38.710]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:13:41.511 --> 00:13:45.636]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:13:46.017 --> 00:13:46.277]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:13:46.297 --> 00:13:48.199]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:48.600]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.161]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:02.933 --> 00:14:06.601]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:14:06.942 --> 00:14:09.968]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:14:10.209 --> 00:14:11.611]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.971]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:14:14.991 --> 00:14:21.214]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:14:21.374 --> 00:14:26.396]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:14:26.917 --> 00:14:36.561]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:14:36.661 --> 00:14:38.783]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:14:39.023 --> 00:14:40.344]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:14:40.604 --> 00:14:42.886]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:44.928]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:14:44.948 --> 00:14:50.033]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:14:50.353 --> 00:14:55.137]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:15:07.187 --> 00:15:09.528]  Do you want to save the fruits of your gardening labor?
[00:15:09.768 --> 00:15:11.889]  And are you looking for an excellent gift idea?

[00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:05.110]  Man thinks, cause he rules the earth.
[00:16:05.791 --> 00:16:08.573]  He can do it as he pleases.
[00:16:09.794 --> 00:16:15.818]  And if things don't change soon, he will.
[00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:20.081]  Oh, man has invented his doom.
[00:16:21.442 --> 00:16:24.004]  First step was touching the moon.
[00:16:25.163 --> 00:16:28.106]  All right, Mike Rivero is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[00:16:28.126 --> 00:16:34.113]  I want to open the phones up in the next segment, but only on ClimateGate.
[00:16:34.673 --> 00:16:36.455]  I want that to be the main focus in this hour.
[00:16:37.817 --> 00:16:40.099]  Only on this situation.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:51.407]  With the new United Nations documents where they're organizing a global government corporate takeover from state government, federal government, local government, right down to your children.
[00:16:51.767 --> 00:16:53.448]  How to turn your children against you.
[00:16:53.928 --> 00:16:56.670]  Now if this doesn't make you angry, folks, I don't know what does.
[00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.111]  Creating a false consensus.
[00:16:58.511 --> 00:17:00.632]  Mike Rivero, where do you see this going?
[00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:07.897]  As their banking takeover blows up in their face, as their global warming tax blows up in their face, as their... But Obama doesn't care.
[00:17:07.917 --> 00:17:09.158]  34,000 more troops to Afghanistan.
[00:17:11.567 --> 00:17:16.590]  Yeah, Obama has already indicated he is just fully in accord with this agenda.
[00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.412]  Remember when he was campaigning for president, he said, I'm going to end the war and you can take that to the bank.
[00:17:21.692 --> 00:17:24.373]  Now he's sending another 30,000 troops into Afghanistan.
[00:17:24.614 --> 00:17:25.874]  He's going to Copenhagen.
[00:17:26.134 --> 00:17:32.197]  His White House spokespeople are standing there with their hair on fire regarding Climategate and insisting they can't smell any smoke.
[00:17:32.457 --> 00:17:34.318]  They're saying, oh, well, the science is settled.
[00:17:34.358 --> 00:17:36.580]  We're going to go in and we're going to sign away in your sovereignty.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.182]  Now, the important thing for people to understand, and again, getting angry right now is appropriate,
[00:17:41.502 --> 00:17:48.044]  Because it's obvious they're going to steamroller this plan through, regardless of the fact that everybody knows it's a fake and a hoax.
[00:17:48.344 --> 00:17:59.128]  Their attitude is, well, as long as they're... Well, we just lost Mike Rivero from Hawaii.
[00:18:02.449 --> 00:18:08.111]  Just a few years ago, video Skype cut out every 30 seconds, now it cuts out every 20, 30 minutes.
[00:18:09.412 --> 00:18:09.732]  But hey,
[00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:26.431]  That is the magic of technology that I can be sitting here in Austin, Texas, going out on satellites to AM and FM stations, global shortwave, satellite, internet, at InfoWars.com, at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:26.451 --> 00:18:34.956]  We can connect to Mike in Hawaii on an island 3-4,000 miles out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
[00:18:36.206 --> 00:18:43.432]  That that can be beamed to satellites or through undersea cables into our studio and out to you instantaneously.
[00:18:44.713 --> 00:18:47.836]  That is certainly something very, very exciting.
[00:18:48.797 --> 00:18:51.319]  So that happens occasionally.
[00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:52.420]  We just did it over a phone line.
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:19:01.848]  It wouldn't be cutting out, but I know the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers like to be able to see Mike Rivera complete with his hula shirt.
[00:19:03.872 --> 00:19:05.994]  I gotta envy him living out in Hawaii.
[00:19:06.615 --> 00:19:08.897]  But we couldn't live in Hawaii because the cost of living is too high.
[00:19:08.917 --> 00:19:11.360]  I wouldn't be able to run this office the way we do.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.921]  Texas is pretty cheap, folks.
[00:19:14.343 --> 00:19:18.467]  Very low cost of living, comparatively.
[00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:22.411]  Austin, great place to have our operation.
[00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:23.452]  If we lived in New York,
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.264]  City or Los Angeles and ran this operation out of Hawaii, somewhere like that.
[00:19:29.624 --> 00:19:30.405]  Plus I'm a Texan.
[00:19:30.445 --> 00:19:35.649]  I love Texas, but I do envy Mike Rivero and living out in Hawaii.
[00:19:35.949 --> 00:19:38.251]  The problem is if I lived in Hawaii, I'd be swimming every day.
[00:19:39.432 --> 00:19:40.793]  Probably even try to take up surfing.
[00:19:42.095 --> 00:19:43.396]  I know I'd be scuba diving every week.
[00:19:45.057 --> 00:19:50.582]  So maybe it's a good thing I'm here in the Texas, that I'm here in the Texas Hill Country.
[00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:56.607]  But we are getting Mike Rivero lined back up.
[00:19:56.647 --> 00:19:59.370]  And if there's any problems, we'll just go ahead and go to regular phone line with him.
[00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:00.531]  You know, we can always do that.
[00:20:02.113 --> 00:20:02.593]  Okay, great.
[00:20:02.613 --> 00:20:03.714]  We got Mike via the phone.
[00:20:03.774 --> 00:20:04.995]  Okay, Mike, you got cut off.
[00:20:05.736 --> 00:20:08.719]  Mike Rivero joining us by telephone from Hawaii.
[00:20:09.099 --> 00:20:09.860]  Finish up your point.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.120]  Okay, well my point is very simple.
[00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:17.642]  It is a founding principle of the United States of America that we were all raised to cherish.
[00:20:18.122 --> 00:20:21.503]  That governments rule with the consent of the governed.
[00:20:21.663 --> 00:20:27.505]  And you need to look at everything the United Nations is doing regarding the imposition of a global government.
[00:20:27.965 --> 00:20:30.426]  None of it is being done with the consent of the people.
[00:20:31.249 --> 00:20:40.955]  They're trying to trick us into going along by creating these false monsters of human-caused global warming so that we'll feel guilty and say, yeah, I guess we gotta do it.
[00:20:41.335 --> 00:20:48.279]  Or they're gonna try and scare us with the global pandemic so that we'll run to them and say, please, please save us from the nasty virus.
[00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:56.444]  Or they'll crash the economy and say, so that we'll run to them and say, please give us some bread, give us some water so that we can survive another day.
[00:20:56.884 --> 00:20:59.306]  And it's not being done with our consent.
[00:20:59.386 --> 00:21:05.250]  It's being done with trickery and deception and the manufacturing of a false consent out of fear.
[00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.031]  This is not democracy.
[00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:08.512]  It is not even a republic.
[00:21:08.732 --> 00:21:11.134]  It is the imposition of a global oligarchy.
[00:21:11.754 --> 00:21:13.655]  And it is being done through fraud.
[00:21:14.096 --> 00:21:17.358]  Everybody listening to this show should be furious right now.
[00:21:17.618 --> 00:21:18.839]  You should be angry.
[00:21:19.548 --> 00:21:21.233]  I mean, screw anger management.
[00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:24.341]  I am seriously ticked off here, and so should you be.
[00:21:24.622 --> 00:21:27.309]  And if you're not angry about this, what's wrong with you?
[00:21:29.807 --> 00:21:32.368]  You know, I was just about to make that point when you made that point, Mike.
[00:21:32.388 --> 00:21:33.408]  We're on the same page.
[00:21:33.908 --> 00:21:46.532]  I yell and scream, I get angry, because we're meant to get angry over being usurped, being enslaved by a bunch of swindling, degenerate parasites, caught red-handed, and they're just continuing on with their fraud.
[00:21:47.172 --> 00:21:50.293]  Everybody needs to stop just accepting this tyranny.
[00:21:51.673 --> 00:21:52.573]  We're on the march.
[00:21:53.073 --> 00:21:54.674]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:55.594 --> 00:21:58.275]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.757 --> 00:22:05.923]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:22:06.063 --> 00:22:08.005]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:22:08.145 --> 00:22:10.428]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:22:10.588 --> 00:22:12.450]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:22:12.871 --> 00:22:14.212]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:22:14.493 --> 00:22:15.534]  There is a solution.
[00:22:15.754 --> 00:22:23.781]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:22:24.182 --> 00:22:31.248]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:22:31.629 --> 00:22:37.294]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[00:22:37.654 --> 00:22:43.256]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:22:43.676 --> 00:22:47.478]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:22:47.838 --> 00:22:52.179]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[00:22:52.199 --> 00:22:54.040]  866-762-9238.
[00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:58.602]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[00:23:00.697 --> 00:23:09.803]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:23:09.843 --> 00:23:12.985]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:23:13.205 --> 00:23:18.909]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[00:23:19.089 --> 00:23:23.572]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:23:23.852 --> 00:23:26.194]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:23:26.474 --> 00:23:35.559]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:41.082]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[00:23:41.222 --> 00:23:43.043]  Help others and earn extra income!
[00:23:43.063 --> 00:23:43.303]  I think so.
[00:24:00.566 --> 00:24:03.490]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.114]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:24:07.575 --> 00:24:11.940]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:17.747]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[00:24:18.027 --> 00:24:22.511]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:24:22.792 --> 00:24:25.834]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:24:26.415 --> 00:24:30.839]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:37.546]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:24:37.806 --> 00:24:39.748]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:24:40.228 --> 00:24:43.049]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:24:43.429 --> 00:24:47.491]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:24:47.931 --> 00:24:50.071]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:50.131]  877-327-0365.
[00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:51.152]  Don't wait, call today!
[00:25:01.343 --> 00:25:14.530]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:19.033]  Mike, I want to go to phone calls with you on Climate Game.
[00:25:19.682 --> 00:25:21.083]  Some of these other issues.
[00:25:21.443 --> 00:25:24.164]  Obama sent close to 40,000 additional U.S.
[00:25:24.204 --> 00:25:28.946]  troops to Afghanistan in the last 11 months, but the media never talked about that.
[00:25:29.066 --> 00:25:31.607]  We would just see little blurbs about incremental 4,000, 5,000, 10,000, 2,000.
[00:25:31.767 --> 00:25:32.607]  And they've sent more U.N.
[00:25:32.627 --> 00:25:32.807]  troops.
[00:25:32.827 --> 00:25:33.128]  They've sent
[00:25:39.797 --> 00:25:50.427]  More NATO forces, they've hired more Afghan troops, over 340,000 troops now, the Associated Press reports, against the Taliban, outnumbering them 12 to 1.
[00:25:52.589 --> 00:25:54.290]  But the Taliban doesn't even really exist.
[00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.811]  There's just different tribes out there.
[00:25:55.851 --> 00:26:00.453]  It's on record that most of the Taliban is working for the coalition forces.
[00:26:00.493 --> 00:26:01.794]  The war is over the pipeline.
[00:26:01.814 --> 00:26:02.655]  It's over the opium.
[00:26:02.995 --> 00:26:10.059]  It's over the black hole of profit that this war causes, this huge racket, as Spendly Butler so eloquently said.
[00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:17.163]  But now Obama has announced 34,000 additional that were never leaving Afghanistan, that they're going to escalate it.
[00:26:17.223 --> 00:26:19.264]  Now they've announced Russia's giving advisors.
[00:26:19.824 --> 00:26:23.768]  They're giving Black Shark attack helicopters their latest type hind.
[00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.332]  Just crazy alliances going on.
[00:26:27.852 --> 00:26:29.614]  What is Afghanistan really about?
[00:26:30.195 --> 00:26:36.702]  And what are all the lefties saying now about their god Obama, the anti-war guy, escalating and keeping us in Iraq?
[00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:44.641]  Well, I think a lot of attention is focusing on a statement Obama made last week, where he's going to finish the job, and everybody's saying, what job?
[00:26:44.781 --> 00:26:45.401]  Why are we there?
[00:26:45.882 --> 00:26:48.484]  Is it the no-opium-poppy-left-behind concept?
[00:26:50.245 --> 00:26:56.549]  We really don't know why we're in there, except that, politically, Obama doesn't want to be the president who lost another war.
[00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:07.417]  More and more observers are saying that Afghanistan is starting to shape up like a new Vietnam, and, you know, Lyndon Johnson took a huge hit for Vietnam, and so did Richard Nixon.
[00:27:08.097 --> 00:27:15.879]  So, nobody wants to be the president in charge of a losing war, even though Obama promised he was going to end the war and bring our troops home.
[00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:25.902]  Now, maybe his promise was that he thought he could win a quick, decisive victory in Afghanistan, despite its long history to the contrary, and he could bring the kids home that way.
[00:27:26.142 --> 00:27:31.743]  But it's obvious that whatever Obama is doing, he is not listening to the people, and that is what he's supposed to be doing.
[00:27:34.582 --> 00:27:35.963]  Well, that's well said, Mike.
[00:27:37.324 --> 00:27:47.130]  Expanding on that, we have these different Democrats saying that, and now Republicans are saying they're looking at it and may agree to it.
[00:27:47.671 --> 00:27:53.394]  Here's the headline, GOP wages internal debate over tax increase for Afghan war.
[00:27:54.075 --> 00:27:54.675]  Obey.
[00:27:55.696 --> 00:27:56.836]  Congressman obey.
[00:27:57.939 --> 00:27:58.820]  That's really his name.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.204]  Tells Obama Afghanistan war tax or no surge.
[00:28:03.484 --> 00:28:07.547]  So they're saying you can have your surge, but we're going to have another tax.
[00:28:07.587 --> 00:28:10.730]  I mean, how many taxes has Obama raised?
[00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.292]  I mean, he's lied about everything.
[00:28:13.372 --> 00:28:15.374]  All he's doing is raising people's taxes.
[00:28:16.437 --> 00:28:20.538]  Well, they're not so much raising them as they're simply adding new ones all the time.
[00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:23.099]  I mean, this latest one, they want to do a carbon tax.
[00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:24.900]  It's a tax literally on the air.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.060]  They've run out of things to tax.
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.981]  We've run out of money to pay the taxes for.
[00:28:29.241 --> 00:28:30.341]  The government is broke.
[00:28:30.782 --> 00:28:35.303]  There was a breaking story just before we went to airtime where they're talking about a major, major uplift.
[00:28:35.743 --> 00:28:40.906]  On the government's official debt ceiling, which we know they've already violated many times over.
[00:28:41.346 --> 00:28:43.207]  The bottom line is they're out of money.
[00:28:43.267 --> 00:28:44.528]  They can't get any money.
[00:28:44.568 --> 00:28:48.210]  They're trying to come to us to loot the last few nickels out of our pockets.
[00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:52.032]  All government knows how to do is raise taxes and take money.
[00:28:52.413 --> 00:28:53.313]  That's all they do.
[00:28:53.453 --> 00:28:54.834]  That's all they know how to do.
[00:28:55.655 --> 00:28:59.757]  And they're absolutely never going to stop until we make them stop.
[00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.151]  But again, I go back to this question.
[00:29:06.232 --> 00:29:22.742]  On every front, the government is openly corrupt, openly run by foreign corporate interest, openly setting up world government, openly expanding the empire, openly setting up a police state domestically, and no matter what we do, they just accelerate their program
[00:29:23.722 --> 00:29:26.543]  And I guess they're counting on Northcom to keep people under control.
[00:29:27.043 --> 00:29:29.124]  Real unemployment's over 22%.
[00:29:29.704 --> 00:29:33.826]  MSNBC admits, and CNBC admits it's 17-plus percent.
[00:29:34.846 --> 00:29:36.347]  I mean, where is all this going, Mike?
[00:29:37.489 --> 00:29:55.175]  Well, I think the game plan right now, and we're seeing this certainly with the climate gate stonewalling, is their idea is we're just going to do what we're going to do anyway, and they're basically relying on the idea that the American people are not going to kick down the doors and rush into the legislative chambers with torches and pitchforks to deal with the matter themselves.
[00:29:55.235 --> 00:30:03.318]  Of course, other rulers have had that same arrogance before, like Louis XVI and Charles I and Ceausescu and Mussolini.
[00:30:03.778 --> 00:30:14.045]  So governments do make these kind of critical mistakes and I think this is a critical mistake for the government to go on acting as if we the American people don't have an opinion that's worth listening to.
[00:30:14.465 --> 00:30:22.070]  There was a Rasmussen poll came out just yesterday where 71% of Americans said flat out they are angry with the federal government.
[00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:26.251]  At some point, it almost feels like a confrontation has become inevitable.
[00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:27.611]  I don't like the idea.
[00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:29.272]  I don't like the idea of violence.
[00:30:29.592 --> 00:30:32.552]  I've been hoping the federal government would collapse the way the USSR did.
[00:30:32.832 --> 00:30:37.633]  But it almost seems like our government is going to keep on abusing the people until somebody fights back.
[00:30:37.933 --> 00:30:45.155]  Maybe that's what they want, because then they can bring in the armies of the United Nations and reconquer the American continent for the New World Order.
[00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:53.015]  And by the way, people 10, 12, 13, 14 years ago when we would read UN documents, West Point training manuals...
[00:30:54.164 --> 00:30:56.726]  Colonel Craig Roberts can talk about his nephew being trained.
[00:30:58.227 --> 00:31:04.570]  They had Wesley Clark there and he said, you will serve the UN, we may use UN troops in America to quell the American people.
[00:31:05.031 --> 00:31:06.872]  Now that's in the NORTHCOM documents.
[00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:09.914]  They had NLE09 with FEMA a few months ago.
[00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:15.978]  FEMA.gov saying troops from 14 foreign nations are training to take on the American people.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:21.403]  And folks couldn't believe that, just like they couldn't believe the Copenhagen Treaty was world government.
[00:31:21.703 --> 00:31:23.544]  Now the UN says it's world government.
[00:31:23.584 --> 00:31:26.826]  I mean, people have got to face the facts.
[00:31:26.926 --> 00:31:30.469]  We are being conquered right now by a group of illegitimate crooks.
[00:31:31.553 --> 00:31:35.015]  It's absolutely right, and you need to understand something about the global government.
[00:31:35.055 --> 00:31:38.337]  I mean, I'm opposed to the concept completely for reasons I've already gone into.
[00:31:38.757 --> 00:31:51.205]  But if you have a government that is coming into being by way of deception and lie and fraud, then this will be a government that can never be honest with its population, can never allow dissent, can never allow examination.
[00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:56.148]  They're already talking about making climate denial a crime on the par with Holocaust denial.
[00:31:57.188 --> 00:32:08.113]  It is going to be an absolute tyranny because they will not be able to allow any freedom whatsoever, or the first thing that's going to happen is that people are going to say, wait a minute, why are we listening to you if it's all a lie?
[00:32:10.514 --> 00:32:12.975]  So, again, how does this come to a head?
[00:32:13.355 --> 00:32:14.316]  How do you see this ending?
[00:32:15.837 --> 00:32:25.481]  I see it ending with enough people getting angry around the world to start kicking on the doors of the legislature and the ruling palaces and say, look, we're not going to go for this anymore.
[00:32:26.261 --> 00:32:31.146]  You can sign all the Copenhagen treaties you want, we're not going to go along with it.
[00:32:31.667 --> 00:32:34.029]  It's like Gandhi did in India, non-cooperation.
[00:32:34.089 --> 00:32:43.819]  You can pass all the laws you want, you can print up all the little fancy pieces of paper that say you have a right to my money and my property, but if I don't go along with it, if I refuse to believe it,
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:50.864]  If I no longer am enslaved by these beliefs that you are trying to put in me, then it's not going to work.
[00:32:51.245 --> 00:32:53.326]  You can run around with your fancy papers and stuff.
[00:32:53.666 --> 00:32:56.928]  There are, you know, 300 million Americans out here.
[00:32:56.969 --> 00:32:58.530]  They're buying up guns and ammo.
[00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.953]  And if it comes down to a question of absolute force, the federal government is going to lose.
[00:33:02.993 --> 00:33:04.854]  And I know they've got the portable torture machines.
[00:33:05.274 --> 00:33:09.697]  Those pain ray guns and tasers and all this other stuff they're buying with our money, I might add.
[00:33:10.017 --> 00:33:15.821]  But the bottom line is, they can target a few small dissenters and put them through a great deal of grief.
[00:33:16.102 --> 00:33:22.646]  But if the American people, all 300 million, got angry at the same time, this federal government would be gone 24 hours later.
[00:33:24.327 --> 00:33:25.848]  And they know that, and it took 5%.
[00:33:28.052 --> 00:33:31.514]  Three to five, depending on which historic numbers you look at, to defeat the British.
[00:33:31.594 --> 00:33:32.454]  We have way more than 5%.
[00:33:32.595 --> 00:33:36.197]  I mean, as you said, over 50% are ready for revolution.
[00:33:36.677 --> 00:33:44.381]  The left-right paradigm, where they play the left and right off against each other, so the people never actually deal with the actual power structure, that's wearing thin.
[00:33:45.382 --> 00:33:47.123]  So, they're coming off the rails.
[00:33:47.163 --> 00:33:48.183]  They're stuck in the mud.
[00:33:48.543 --> 00:33:54.507]  Their whole juggernaut is grinding to a halt right now, and I just hope listeners realize we are in
[00:33:55.347 --> 00:33:58.128]  One of the greatest times that we've ever seen.
[00:33:58.188 --> 00:34:05.591]  We are going into a time when the future of humanity is going to be basically charted.
[00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:20.717]  And every email, every phone call, every letter written to the editor, every speech you give at church, every video you give your co-workers, every person you send to PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com or WhatReallyHappened.com news article to,
[00:34:21.966 --> 00:34:28.871]  Is one more person we begin to wake up because people are now ready to hear the truth when they weren't ready to hear it in the past.
[00:34:29.351 --> 00:34:32.053]  We've been proven right about everything we talked about.
[00:34:32.113 --> 00:34:37.597]  We're only going off the Globalist's own playbook, their own reports, their own white papers.
[00:34:38.298 --> 00:34:39.779]  Something this big can't be hidden.
[00:34:39.819 --> 00:34:41.880]  People say, well, if this was happening, there'd be leaks.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.261]  We'd have whistleblowers.
[00:34:43.301 --> 00:34:44.142]  We'd have documents.
[00:34:44.262 --> 00:34:44.822]  We do!
[00:34:45.623 --> 00:34:46.944]  You know, that's the whole point here.
[00:34:47.544 --> 00:34:51.287]  And I mean, I can rant and rave about this all day.
[00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:56.921]  It's just so mind-blowing to now be alive in this time.
[00:34:57.161 --> 00:34:59.282]  Let's go to callers on ClimateGate.
[00:34:59.642 --> 00:35:01.383]  Carrie in Kansas, you're on the air.
[00:35:03.203 --> 00:35:12.187]  Hey guys, as you know, this is not only a horrible front against sovereignty, this is a money-making scheme for the United Nations.
[00:35:13.127 --> 00:35:16.569]  As part of the Clean Development Mechanism, it's in the Kyoto Protocol.
[00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:19.320]  There's what's called the share of proceeds.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:27.345]  The United Nations is literally collecting money off of all of these emissions credits that they're creating through the Clean Development Mechanism.
[00:35:27.805 --> 00:35:33.849]  And they suspect that they're going to have almost 3 billion emissions credits created by 2012.
[00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:43.034]  Right now, those credits, the CERs, the Certified Emissions Reductions Credits, are going on Sandor's European
[00:35:43.632 --> 00:35:44.333]  I don't think so.
[00:36:00.643 --> 00:36:06.886]  Barack Obama, during the campaign, he said that he thought that a reasonable price for carbon by the ton was $40.
[00:36:07.147 --> 00:36:11.889]  That's twice what it is in Europe, which is the mandatory market.
[00:36:12.249 --> 00:36:19.613]  The price for these same instruments in the United States on the CCX, where it's still voluntary, right now is like 75 cents.
[00:36:20.574 --> 00:36:28.438]  So there's a total push by the money-making organizations on the planet, specifically the United Nations and especially the World Bank,
[00:36:28.897 --> 00:36:34.881]  All of the other banks that are affiliated with these gangsters and criminals because they're making money off of it.
[00:36:35.162 --> 00:36:38.764]  Exactly, and that's why Newt Gingrich is for it.
[00:36:38.884 --> 00:36:40.666]  That's why all the big banks are for it.
[00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:43.228]  That's why all the big oil companies are pushing it.
[00:36:43.948 --> 00:36:45.889]  That's why this is all happening.
[00:36:46.729 --> 00:36:50.870]  And a lot of the public really thinks the Earth's dying and polar bears are drowning.
[00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:52.950]  They believe polar bears can't swim.
[00:36:53.591 --> 00:36:57.492]  Just the simplistic fraud is so over the top.
[00:36:57.572 --> 00:37:02.113]  And the carbon taxes and carbon credits is only a small piece of all this.
[00:37:02.533 --> 00:37:05.314]  They're going to tax beef and poultry and fish.
[00:37:05.934 --> 00:37:10.178]  And television sets, and your dog, California, is already doing it with the TV sets.
[00:37:10.518 --> 00:37:11.679]  This is being announced.
[00:37:11.999 --> 00:37:14.962]  This is literally thousands of taxes.
[00:37:15.022 --> 00:37:15.682]  Mike Rivera.
[00:37:16.363 --> 00:37:18.144]  Absolutely, and it's more than just the taxes.
[00:37:18.164 --> 00:37:29.714]  We have an article at WhatReallyHappened.com today where basically it's going down the list of the world's richest people and how much of their personal fortunes they've invested in these new so-called green industries.
[00:37:30.094 --> 00:37:44.998]  They're all lining up to invest in these brand new companies because one of the effects of this global warming hoax is to encourage people to stop buying old products that are now declared to be dangerous to Earth and to start buying these new products.
[00:37:45.198 --> 00:37:50.639]  Well, the new products are all owned by these very rich people who are getting on board the Green Revolution.
[00:37:50.999 --> 00:37:52.581]  And it's not about saving the earth.
[00:37:52.901 --> 00:37:58.966]  It is simply about stealing market share away from existing companies through the use of this propaganda and trick.
[00:37:59.186 --> 00:38:02.149]  As I said, there's trillions of dollars on the line here.
[00:38:02.449 --> 00:38:05.252]  And this is why they're not going to walk away from this hoax without a fight.
[00:38:06.601 --> 00:38:07.181]  Well said.
[00:38:07.242 --> 00:38:09.403]  I'll tell you, Kerry, you were extremely informed.
[00:38:09.463 --> 00:38:10.985]  I wish more people knew what you knew.
[00:38:11.705 --> 00:38:14.527]  What are you doing in your area to wake up folks that have no idea?
[00:38:14.687 --> 00:38:19.011]  They're told, hey, green cars, electric cars, windmills, sounds great.
[00:38:19.651 --> 00:38:22.874]  But that's the sugar coating of this global government.
[00:38:23.174 --> 00:38:25.116]  The globalists have nothing to do with that.
[00:38:25.156 --> 00:38:26.677]  They could care less about all that.
[00:38:27.097 --> 00:38:28.879]  That's just a facade they put up.
[00:38:28.919 --> 00:38:33.182]  So when people hear, oh, the UN wants me to have an electric car, isn't that good?
[00:38:33.543 --> 00:38:35.004]  It has nothing to do with this.
[00:38:36.291 --> 00:38:37.372]  Yeah, we know that for a fact.
[00:38:37.472 --> 00:38:44.219]  I posted up an article on the Prison Planet Forum called, uh, the Kyoto Protocol, Oppressing People, Enriching Banks.
[00:38:44.599 --> 00:38:56.250]  What you're talking about with these electric cars, what the United Nations is doing right now in third world countries, uh, in the name of quote-unquote saving the environment, is funding these clean development mechanisms.
[00:38:56.611 --> 00:38:58.372]  So instead of, instead of, uh,
[00:38:59.532 --> 00:39:04.457]  From our perspective, we say, oh, well, coal is dirty, and we need to save the environment, we need to put windmills up.
[00:39:04.777 --> 00:39:05.618]  Well, that's fine.
[00:39:06.058 --> 00:39:08.180]  But when you live in China, and the U.N.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:17.448]  comes in with funding from the World Bank, and says, we're going to build a hydroelectric dam here, because it's clean, and by the way, all you one million people who live here, yeah, just leave.
[00:39:18.188 --> 00:39:19.670]  Well, it's worse than that.
[00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:20.490]  It's worse than that.
[00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:21.411]  It allows the U.N.
[00:39:22.728 --> 00:39:30.033]  To selectively give the contracts and the money to select corporations that fund the United Nations.
[00:39:30.053 --> 00:39:33.736]  So it's a takeover of the global economy by a select group of corporations.
[00:39:33.756 --> 00:39:34.316]  Thank you, Kerry.
[00:39:34.356 --> 00:39:34.877]  Great points.
[00:39:35.337 --> 00:39:36.378]  Rusty in Texas.
[00:39:36.458 --> 00:39:37.459]  Rusty, you're on the air.
[00:39:37.479 --> 00:39:38.800]  Hi, Alex.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:47.306]  Last night, I received a recorded message from Randy Nagabower, our congressman here in West Texas.
[00:39:48.374 --> 00:39:58.082]  And he was talking about the carbon tax, the carbon credits and everything, and he said in the recorded message that it would raise everybody's energy bills
[00:39:59.187 --> 00:40:01.228]  Per family, $3,400 a year.
[00:40:01.348 --> 00:40:02.548]  Yeah, no.
[00:40:02.849 --> 00:40:06.170]  The United Nations and the Democrats admit that.
[00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.211]  That is a very low estimate.
[00:40:10.071 --> 00:40:13.633]  The plan will double the price of coal-powered electricity.
[00:40:14.213 --> 00:40:16.854]  So 51% of our electricity comes from that.
[00:40:17.554 --> 00:40:23.257]  And even if you don't have a coal plant in your area, the energy is all pooled and shared in most areas.
[00:40:23.517 --> 00:40:28.339]  So most of the electricity we get has coal-generated power in it.
[00:40:29.139 --> 00:40:32.501]  And that alone will devastate the economy.
[00:40:32.982 --> 00:40:34.263]  And this is just the beginning.
[00:40:35.263 --> 00:40:40.387]  I mean, it's like they promised the health care plan wouldn't have penalties for not having insurance.
[00:40:40.907 --> 00:40:42.648]  It's got $5,000 penalties.
[00:40:43.689 --> 00:40:46.731]  It's got a quarter million dollar fines, five years in prison.
[00:40:47.331 --> 00:40:49.052]  It takes 2.5 to 5% out of your check.
[00:40:49.072 --> 00:40:49.353]  I mean, look.
[00:40:53.979 --> 00:40:58.681]  These big banks want profit centers and they use government to come in with excuses.
[00:40:58.741 --> 00:41:01.203]  Healthcare, the environment, whatever it is to loot us.
[00:41:01.643 --> 00:41:04.264]  Just like the banker bailout was to unfreeze mortgages.
[00:41:04.765 --> 00:41:10.928]  The day after they passed it, October 3rd, they said we're not going to spend it on mortgages and we're not going to tell you where the money's going.
[00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:14.351]  And then it turned out it was going to George Soros and Al Gore and others.
[00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:21.577]  I mean, we have total criminal swindlers stealing everything, and that isn't enough for them.
[00:41:21.837 --> 00:41:22.958]  They want even more.
[00:41:23.039 --> 00:41:23.719]  Mike Rivera.
[00:41:23.739 --> 00:41:25.321]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:26.742]  Wealth is an addiction.
[00:41:27.042 --> 00:41:29.785]  We're dealing with people who are addicted to your money.
[00:41:30.365 --> 00:41:31.706]  They can't get enough of it.
[00:41:31.726 --> 00:41:38.272]  They get a thrill from having it to spend buying another yacht, another car, another piece of jewelry.
[00:41:38.533 --> 00:41:41.856]  They're addicted to money and it is time for an intervention.
[00:41:43.677 --> 00:41:44.258]  Absolutely.
[00:41:44.818 --> 00:41:47.661]  Go ahead Rusty.
[00:41:48.041 --> 00:41:55.388]  The 35,000 troops, of course you know I was in the Gulf War, and 35,000 troops after eight years is
[00:41:57.137 --> 00:42:00.521]  If you're going to finish something, why not send 200,000?
[00:42:00.641 --> 00:42:02.704]  What's the difference?
[00:42:03.445 --> 00:42:06.089]  Why not defeat them with overwhelming force?
[00:42:15.115 --> 00:42:18.079]  There's different Democrats here saying, what's the point of the war?
[00:42:18.519 --> 00:42:19.621]  This is all stupid.
[00:42:19.661 --> 00:42:21.883]  This is all a failure.
[00:42:21.903 --> 00:42:25.567]  I'm looking for the exact quote one Democrat had.
[00:42:25.607 --> 00:42:32.095]  Democrat, war tax proponent, obey calls, expect a troop surge, a fool's errand.
[00:42:33.427 --> 00:42:33.867]  Well, no.
[00:42:34.108 --> 00:42:40.073]  I mean, if you believe the fake objectives we're told on the news bring democracy to Afghanistan, give me a break.
[00:42:40.673 --> 00:42:43.956]  But for the real objectives, it's a great success.
[00:42:43.976 --> 00:42:50.942]  500 billion a year in opium, hundreds of billions in oil, hundreds of billions in no-bid weapons contracts for all these fat cat companies.
[00:42:50.962 --> 00:42:52.403]  It's not a fool's errand.
[00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:56.907]  Our troops are there to engage in the looting.
[00:42:57.467 --> 00:42:59.509]  They're there to hold the ground so the banks can take over.
[00:43:01.127 --> 00:43:02.388]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:43:02.428 --> 00:43:07.773]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:43:08.013 --> 00:43:12.637]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:43:13.038 --> 00:43:18.122]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:43:18.623 --> 00:43:23.307]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:30.744]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:43:30.944 --> 00:43:31.844]  And here's the best part.
[00:43:32.064 --> 00:43:38.428]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:43:38.748 --> 00:43:41.589]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.091]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:43:48.713 --> 00:43:52.435]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:43:52.955 --> 00:43:57.458]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:43:57.798 --> 00:44:00.219]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:44:00.859 --> 00:44:01.219]  Hello!
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:05.942]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:44:06.282 --> 00:44:10.784]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:44:11.104 --> 00:44:15.887]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:44:16.247 --> 00:44:20.169]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:24.251]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[00:44:24.371 --> 00:44:26.913]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[00:44:27.173 --> 00:44:28.073]  It was empowering.
[00:44:28.194 --> 00:44:32.096]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[00:44:32.176 --> 00:44:34.997]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[00:44:35.017 --> 00:44:37.739]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[00:44:37.859 --> 00:44:38.639]  Thank you so much.
[00:44:38.859 --> 00:44:41.621]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:42.261]  Thanks again.
[00:44:42.441 --> 00:44:45.063]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[00:44:45.825 --> 00:44:48.827]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:44:49.227 --> 00:44:52.609]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:44:52.809 --> 00:45:00.014]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:45:00.995 --> 00:45:06.018]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[00:45:06.138 --> 00:45:11.541]  With so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.

[00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:34.539]  Mike Rivero is our guest.
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.862]  Let's go ahead and talk to Craig in Washington.
[00:46:39.942 --> 00:46:41.022]  Craig, you're on the air.
[00:46:42.503 --> 00:46:42.744]  Hello.
[00:46:43.584 --> 00:46:43.904]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:44.965 --> 00:46:48.247]  Oh, just mentioning on this clamigator, at least a legal
[00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:50.240]  Activities regarding that.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:59.104]  In Washington State, an employer has to pay a tax on how their employees get to work.
[00:46:59.564 --> 00:47:02.746]  So if they drive a car, they pay X amount.
[00:47:03.226 --> 00:47:05.607]  Oh yeah, there are already hundreds of carbon taxes.
[00:47:06.467 --> 00:47:11.210]  I'm trying to explain to people there's hundreds in place now, thousands going into place.
[00:47:12.731 --> 00:47:15.812]  Yeah, and then, you know, people just kind of overlook it or don't pay attention.
[00:47:15.852 --> 00:47:17.613]  But, you know, when it quietly started,
[00:47:18.812 --> 00:47:20.794]  I mean, no one, like, pieces it together.
[00:47:21.134 --> 00:47:31.823]  How could this be legal or, you know, choosing, making people either come to work a certain way or charge them, like, well, if you carpool, then you pay X amount if you walk.
[00:47:31.843 --> 00:47:32.763]  And look at what that does.
[00:47:32.823 --> 00:47:35.846]  It also tracks how you travel, what you're doing.
[00:47:35.926 --> 00:47:42.191]  It gives your employer more work to do, more jobs get lost because of the increased expenses.
[00:47:42.671 --> 00:47:46.915]  Mike Rivera, what about the Weather Channel founder talking about filing suit?
[00:47:47.355 --> 00:47:55.897]  I mean, we have real evidence now of these big climatologists for the UN trying to persecute other climatologists, get them fired, not let their stuff get published.
[00:47:56.317 --> 00:48:00.079]  That right there is a major civil suit, open and shut, caught red-handed.
[00:48:00.779 --> 00:48:08.801]  We have criminal charges with the British University, the head university, working with the British government to block FOIA requests behind the scenes illegally.
[00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:12.982]  We have the fraud of Al Gore trying to make everybody pay him a tax.
[00:48:13.322 --> 00:48:15.963]  I mean, isn't civil lawsuits a way to go?
[00:48:16.952 --> 00:48:18.993]  I think it's definitely one way to go.
[00:48:19.073 --> 00:48:27.839]  I mean, frankly, given the fact that a lot of these institutions that have been caught rigging the data are funded with public tax money, I think a class action suit's appropriate here.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:37.966]  I think we absolutely have a right to sue pretty much the entire institution of global warming for perpetrating a fraud using taxpayer funds.
[00:48:38.346 --> 00:48:44.170]  NOAA's been compromised, NWAI's been compromised down in New Zealand, Hadley's compromised in Great Britain.
[00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:46.532]  The whole structure is a gigantic
[00:48:46.952 --> 00:48:47.313]  Hoax!
[00:48:47.754 --> 00:48:49.557]  I would hope there might be a legal remedy.
[00:48:49.817 --> 00:48:58.692]  Unfortunately, you have to remember that those judges in the courts are basically being paid by the same government that was hiring all these scientists to rig the climate change data.
[00:48:59.955 --> 00:49:15.041]  And we now have the newest internal UN documents where they admit a covert operation to take over the universities, the scientists, to help them covertly set up world government and to brainwash children.
[00:49:15.381 --> 00:49:21.043]  I mean, this is sensational level information right now at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:33.126]  It absolutely is, but you need to remember one more thing, and that is that the government has started invoking sovereign immunity for pretty much everything it does, which is this idea that we can't sue the government no matter what it does.
[00:49:33.467 --> 00:49:46.174]  Now, I've never seen sovereign immunity in the Constitution, but it has been used in a lot of federal cases recently involving vaccinations, involving various other malfeasances by the government, where they simply say, we own the courts, you can't sue us.
[00:49:46.674 --> 00:49:49.756]  And of course, on that path lies the road to a real revolution.
[00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:55.113]  Listen, Craig, just get involved with locals.
[00:49:55.253 --> 00:50:04.739]  Point out that Washington State now wants, along with California and Texas, to put a box in your car, by law, that taxes you by the mile on top of gas tax.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.921]  That's now been proposed by Obama.
[00:50:07.341 --> 00:50:11.644]  I'd tell people about that ten years ago, because the Department of Transportation was proposing it.
[00:50:11.924 --> 00:50:12.885]  People laugh at me.
[00:50:13.385 --> 00:50:15.807]  The time for procrastination must end now.
[00:50:16.788 --> 00:50:17.328]  Absolutely.
[00:50:17.348 --> 00:50:18.369]  This is the final battle.
[00:50:20.526 --> 00:50:21.826]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:21.886 --> 00:50:24.907]  Well, Mike, always informative having you on from Hawaii.
[00:50:25.287 --> 00:50:27.688]  Thank you, and I look forward to having you back on with us next month.
[00:50:28.308 --> 00:50:29.528]  I look forward to it again, Alex.
[00:50:29.568 --> 00:50:30.308]  Thanks for having me.
[00:50:30.788 --> 00:50:32.969]  There goes Mike Rivero of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:50:32.989 --> 00:50:37.030]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:50:51.189 --> 00:50:53.810]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:59.173]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:50:59.533 --> 00:51:01.274]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:51:01.574 --> 00:51:06.396]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:51:06.576 --> 00:51:07.537]  How much do you want?
[00:51:07.757 --> 00:51:08.517]  When do you want it?
[00:51:08.898 --> 00:51:10.478]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:51:10.778 --> 00:51:11.599]  When will you need it?
[00:51:11.839 --> 00:51:13.900]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.161]  Will there be any food?
[00:51:15.401 --> 00:51:16.001]  Will it make your
[00:51:16.141 --> 00:51:16.501]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:37.582]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:51:41.123 --> 00:51:42.243]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:42.283 --> 00:51:44.104]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:05.293 --> 00:52:05.953]  Big Brother.
[00:52:06.614 --> 00:52:07.654]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:08.374 --> 00:52:09.455]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:10.135 --> 00:52:10.935]  You want answers?
[00:52:11.716 --> 00:52:12.616]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:12.636 --> 00:52:16.978]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:17.458 --> 00:52:21.500]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:24.528 --> 00:52:28.129]  We are now into our number three in 30 minutes.
[00:52:28.749 --> 00:52:37.212]  Colonel Craig Roberts will be joining us to talk about the police state, the new world order, take your phone calls, what he's hearing from military and police.
[00:52:37.692 --> 00:52:39.033]  He's got a leg in both camps.
[00:52:40.633 --> 00:52:43.574]  Always extremely riveting and informative.
[00:52:44.335 --> 00:52:47.736]  My good buddy Colonel Craig Roberts joining us coming up.
[00:52:50.317 --> 00:52:51.477]  I want to play three minutes
[00:52:52.799 --> 00:52:57.041]  From a interview last night with Larry King Live that Jesse Ventura had.
[00:52:57.061 --> 00:53:05.225]  Of course, you heard the former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura on with us last Friday in that exclusive interview along with Lord Monckton.
[00:53:06.886 --> 00:53:12.269]  His TV show, he says he's going to really be surprised if it ends up airing coming up tomorrow night, 10 p.m.
[00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:15.150]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:18.132]  Central on True TV, formerly Court TV.
[00:53:19.915 --> 00:53:24.818]  And of course, I'm a big part of what five of the seven episodes and consultant on the whole enchilada.
[00:53:24.838 --> 00:53:27.380]  And it looks like it's me leaning towards our side.
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.661]  I haven't seen all the episodes.
[00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:32.123]  I've just seen pieces of some of the episodes and parts I'm in.
[00:53:34.965 --> 00:53:37.567]  But I want to go ahead and go out to break.
[00:53:39.676 --> 00:53:51.025]  With this clip where he gets into 9-11 truth with Larry King live, he has a lot of courage, and we salute Jesse Ventura, who we've really woken up to a great extent.
[00:53:51.065 --> 00:53:51.465]  Here it is.
[00:53:52.446 --> 00:53:59.771]  Just within the last decade, we won't be covering John F. Kennedy or Dr. Martin Luther King or any of the stuff back then.
[00:54:00.152 --> 00:54:06.577]  We kept it to the 10-year last decade, and believe me, the problem, Larry, wasn't finding conspiracies.
[00:54:06.917 --> 00:54:09.179]  It was choosing which ones we wanted to cover.
[00:54:10.987 --> 00:54:12.228]  What is the 9-11 conspiracy?
[00:54:40.727 --> 00:54:41.127]  I don't know.
[00:54:41.187 --> 00:54:41.627]  What truth?
[00:54:42.188 --> 00:54:46.189]  Well, we can't find it, naturally, because I don't have subpoena power.
[00:54:46.589 --> 00:54:51.691]  We don't have the ability to put people under oath and threaten them with prosecution.
[00:54:51.791 --> 00:54:54.312]  What would they be hiding in that building?
[00:54:54.812 --> 00:54:55.172]  I don't know.
[00:54:55.192 --> 00:54:55.632]  What do you think?
[00:54:55.672 --> 00:54:58.253]  In your wildest imagination, what do you think?
[00:54:58.613 --> 00:55:07.896]  Well, in my wildest imagination, I find it very difficult that those buildings could fall at the speed of gravity without being assisted in some way.
[00:55:08.256 --> 00:55:10.497]  And I used to do demolition for a living.
[00:55:11.277 --> 00:55:15.539]  And how could those buildings fall as fast as I used to free fall out of an airplane?
[00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:28.592]  I mean, if you took a billiard ball and dropped it at the height of the Twin Towers, and you just merely stopped it and started it every floor in free fall, it would take over a minute and a half to reach the ground.
[00:55:28.913 --> 00:55:30.695]  The buildings were down in ten seconds.
[00:55:32.833 --> 00:55:34.734]  So you think it might have been something inside?
[00:55:34.754 --> 00:55:39.097]  I think that most definitely our government has not been honest with us.
[00:55:40.018 --> 00:55:42.580]  And here's the big point I make on 9-11.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:45.042]  Why is it off-limits to talk about it?
[00:55:45.362 --> 00:55:48.184]  Why is it off-limits to question and ask questions?
[00:55:48.544 --> 00:55:50.966]  You know, when I went through Judy G. Seale training,
[00:55:51.346 --> 00:55:55.448]  I was taught in demolition, Larry, that there is no dumb question.
[00:55:55.728 --> 00:55:58.090]  That if you don't understand it, it's not dumb.
[00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:03.553]  And that's how I've lived my life, and I have a lot of questions that the government refuses to answer.
[00:56:05.293 --> 00:56:07.994]  Is the 9-11 story the first show this Wednesday?
[00:56:08.374 --> 00:56:08.994]  No, it's not.
[00:56:09.094 --> 00:56:10.414]  The first show will be HAARP.
[00:56:11.114 --> 00:56:13.915]  And it's based upon a book that a scientist wrote.
[00:56:14.435 --> 00:56:17.436]  And it says, angels don't play this harp.
[00:56:17.916 --> 00:56:24.277]  It's about an antenna grouping that we have up in Alaska that's supposedly an unclassified research center.
[00:56:24.637 --> 00:56:27.578]  But if it's unclassified, why wouldn't they let me in?
[00:56:29.824 --> 00:56:31.405]  All right, that's going to be something.
[00:56:31.425 --> 00:56:36.248]  Jesse Ventura's new show, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[00:56:36.368 --> 00:56:38.290]  Clearly they're not being honest, Larry.
[00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:40.992]  Because if it was unclassified, I'd just get in.
[00:56:42.172 --> 00:56:42.653]  I get you.
[00:56:43.293 --> 00:56:46.615]  The new show debuts Wednesday night on TruTV.
[00:56:47.096 --> 00:56:49.838]  Ariana Huffington and Ben Stein will join the party.
[00:56:50.836 --> 00:56:51.996]  And they were invited.
[00:56:52.517 --> 00:56:53.777]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:53.977 --> 00:56:55.177]  Now, that's courage.
[00:56:55.217 --> 00:57:00.659]  Jesse Ventura on national television, talking about John Farmer and the 9-1-1 Commission.
[00:57:00.699 --> 00:57:05.641]  An illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:57:05.761 --> 00:57:10.122]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:57:10.302 --> 00:57:12.143]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:57:12.563 --> 00:57:13.924]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:57:14.184 --> 00:57:15.224]  There is a solution.
[00:57:15.464 --> 00:57:23.488]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:59:00.168 --> 00:59:04.390]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:05.330]  Number one.
[00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:08.771]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:59:09.052 --> 00:59:09.612]  Number two.
[00:59:09.912 --> 00:59:14.454]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:14.794 --> 00:59:15.254]  It's true.
[00:59:15.534 --> 00:59:20.096]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:20.416 --> 00:59:20.957]  Number 3.
[00:59:21.237 --> 00:59:24.519]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:28.562]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:28.743 --> 00:59:29.283]  Number 4.
[00:59:29.523 --> 00:59:31.905]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:32.285 --> 00:59:35.688]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:35.968 --> 00:59:36.188]  Number 5.
[00:59:36.769 --> 00:59:40.692]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:40.912 --> 00:59:45.676]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:45.956 --> 00:59:49.978]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:59:56.501 --> 00:59:56.821]  Brother.
[00:59:56.861 --> 00:59:57.661]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:57.761 --> 00:59:58.602]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:58.642 --> 00:59:59.222]  You want answers?
[00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:04.244]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.786 --> 01:00:17.430]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:22.074]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.176 --> 01:00:25.758]  Okay, here is the deal.
[01:00:26.238 --> 01:00:29.081]  I've got a bunch of other economic and war news I want to go over.
[01:00:29.141 --> 01:00:35.488]  Obama is set to give a speech, as you know, but they're set to release ahead of the speech the timetable for the war.
[01:00:37.532 --> 01:00:38.813]  I know their past timetables.
[01:00:38.893 --> 01:00:42.837]  They will lie and say in two years they will look at reducing forces.
[01:00:43.657 --> 01:00:46.440]  Then in two years they will decide they need more forces.
[01:00:48.001 --> 01:00:54.686]  Then in two years when they say that they'll say but in two years we'll look at it again and then in two years they'll decide more forces.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:55.780]  I think?
[01:01:14.246 --> 01:01:16.308]  So they've gone from 100,000 to 200,000 to 300,000 to 340,000 plus right now with this latest 35,000, 34,000.
[01:01:16.368 --> 01:01:18.610]  They're two different numbers we're seeing being sent.
[01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:21.553]  And they'll say, oh, well, we're going to cut back to 300,000 in a couple years.
[01:01:21.633 --> 01:01:22.554]  Isn't that nice of us?
[01:01:22.594 --> 01:01:23.715]  And the wars never end.
[01:01:23.735 --> 01:01:27.098]  We've been in Afghanistan eight years.
[01:01:36.167 --> 01:01:40.071]  In Iraq, we've been there for six and a half years, never leaving.
[01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:47.157]  In Iraq, they were building giant bases, calling them embassies, that would hold 3,000 people per base.
[01:01:47.618 --> 01:01:48.438]  They're never leaving.
[01:01:48.979 --> 01:01:55.465]  And the internal Pentagon documents that are publicly available, but not put in the newspaper, they're saying we're going to be there in 2020.
[01:01:57.682 --> 01:01:59.364]  Our troops haven't left Korea, have they?
[01:02:00.165 --> 01:02:01.346]  Have the troops left Germany?
[01:02:01.807 --> 01:02:02.888]  Have the troops left Britain?
[01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:06.713]  Have the troops left... I mean, we've got troops in 160 countries.
[01:02:07.313 --> 01:02:09.075]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of bases.
[01:02:09.336 --> 01:02:10.397]  These aren't our troops.
[01:02:10.777 --> 01:02:12.800]  These are troops of the New World Order Empire!
[01:02:14.261 --> 01:02:18.062]  And they use our bases to bring in narcotics and laundered money.
[01:02:18.623 --> 01:02:28.346]  Those are sovereign bases of the New World Order empire to bring in assassins, to bring in hitmen, to bring in child sex slaves.
[01:02:28.366 --> 01:02:29.387]  That's come out with the U.N.
[01:02:29.407 --> 01:02:33.268]  and our own government and DynCorp and Halliburton, Chicago Tribune.
[01:02:34.188 --> 01:02:35.549]  That's what this is all about.
[01:02:36.337 --> 01:02:38.458]  Drug dealing, kidnapping, murder.
[01:02:39.798 --> 01:02:48.122]  And of course, 99% of the military, they're cooking dinner, carrying out the trash, cleaning their guns, pressing their uniforms, marching around the square.
[01:02:49.863 --> 01:02:50.963]  They're just doing jobs.
[01:02:51.783 --> 01:02:58.266]  But the commanders and the CIA and the intelligence units, they are running the real criminal operation.
[01:02:58.646 --> 01:03:00.127]  So these are globalist tentacles.
[01:03:00.727 --> 01:03:05.309]  And just like the global system has taken over America and used America to take over the world,
[01:03:06.673 --> 01:03:08.933]  It's the same thing happening in these third world nations.
[01:03:11.794 --> 01:03:14.474]  Obama wants Afghan war over in three years.
[01:03:14.535 --> 01:03:25.177]  See, they told me that CNN just announced that in mere minutes, Obama will release his new timetable.
[01:03:25.217 --> 01:03:26.177]  And I said two years.
[01:03:26.217 --> 01:03:26.997]  No, he says three.
[01:03:27.457 --> 01:03:28.437]  So even longer.
[01:03:29.017 --> 01:03:32.598]  And in three years, that pushes him up into the next election.
[01:03:33.925 --> 01:03:41.448]  And he can promise then to maybe bring some home and then you read, oh, it says they'll start drawing them down in three years.
[01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:47.711]  The new troop development deployment would increase the total U.S.
[01:03:47.751 --> 01:03:51.533]  commitment to over 100,000 troops bolstered by 45,000 NATO forces.
[01:03:51.593 --> 01:03:54.934]  And of course, I don't mention all the other forces here.
[01:03:59.596 --> 01:04:01.657]  He's going to go to the West Point Military Academy.
[01:04:03.345 --> 01:04:05.386]  Later today to officially announce his plans.
[01:04:07.407 --> 01:04:09.569]  It will be his second escalation of U.S.
[01:04:09.609 --> 01:04:13.951]  forces in the war-torn Islamic country since he came to power in January.
[01:04:14.011 --> 01:04:18.914]  See, he's already put in an additional 40, but no one ever talked about that for the last 11 months.
[01:04:18.954 --> 01:04:20.735]  It was all, will he do a surge?
[01:04:21.015 --> 01:04:25.298]  Will he do a surge to politically distract you from what happened previously?
[01:04:27.079 --> 01:04:38.000]  So we're going to go to Derek, Andrew, Ron, Joni, Brandon, and others, and then Colonel Craig Roberts is going to be joining us to go over a host of issues and the wider view on the New World Order.
[01:04:42.213 --> 01:04:47.274]  But I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson up, as we do most days now, to give us a gold report.
[01:04:47.294 --> 01:04:48.574]  He wasn't on with us yesterday.
[01:04:48.994 --> 01:04:52.355]  Gold is way up again today.
[01:04:53.015 --> 01:04:56.376]  And again, joining us is Ted Anderson.
[01:04:56.396 --> 01:04:57.536]  Ted, good to have you here with us.
[01:04:57.836 --> 01:04:59.476]  Yeah, good to be up with you.
[01:04:59.937 --> 01:05:03.477]  Yesterday, real busy getting those spots running on Rush Limbaugh.
[01:05:03.537 --> 01:05:10.179]  It'll be great to have some of those neoconservatives order your endgame video and actually see what's going on in the real world.
[01:05:10.219 --> 01:05:11.839]  Maybe we can wake up a couple people.
[01:05:12.515 --> 01:05:19.381]  Man, I tell you, the dollar sure is crumbling today, and gold just went over $1,200, up as high as $1,202 today.
[01:05:19.801 --> 01:05:20.342]  Unbelievable.
[01:05:20.382 --> 01:05:30.050]  Ted, let me stop you right there, because I meant to preface this with scores of news articles that everyone, I'm sure, has seen where they're announcing gold mines are running out of gold worldwide.
[01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:36.074]  They have to mine more ore to get a small amount of gold, so the veins are running out.
[01:05:36.894 --> 01:05:38.856]  The production price is increasing.
[01:05:39.357 --> 01:05:40.878]  The Asians are buying it up.
[01:05:40.918 --> 01:05:43.101]  The Chinese, the Indians, the Japanese.
[01:05:44.202 --> 01:05:47.365]  Institutional investors, big central banks are hoarding gold.
[01:05:47.766 --> 01:05:49.407]  The yuppies are starting to buy gold.
[01:05:49.848 --> 01:05:51.970]  We've been warning people as we watch the run-up.
[01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:57.894]  From $260 an ounce right up to $1,200 a day.
[01:05:57.914 --> 01:06:20.525]  And for people who don't understand, when you look at the Dubai default, and that country starting to go under, when you look at, which was supposedly the apple of everyone's eye, when I get up here on the radio and I tell people they are out of their minds if they don't buy gold and silver from Midas Resources that has the best prices out there that I've seen bar none,
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:26.886]  It is such a no-brainer, and so I want you to comment on all these different factors, Ted.
[01:06:27.707 --> 01:06:31.771]  Well, I mean, all that stuff is obviously a play in the marketplace.
[01:06:31.811 --> 01:06:38.339]  What happened this morning while we were sleeping again, the London market went up over $1,200 an ounce on gold.
[01:06:38.659 --> 01:06:42.624]  The Dubai thing, it was thought that that might drive actual gold prices down.
[01:06:43.224 --> 01:06:44.265]  And it hasn't at all.
[01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:49.768]  Gold has gone up over $1,200 an ounce in London again, while the United States is in bed.
[01:06:49.788 --> 01:06:51.309]  And now that the U.S.
[01:06:51.369 --> 01:06:58.674]  market has opened up, it went over $1,202, corrected back into the real high $1,190 range, and that's where it's sitting right now.
[01:07:00.435 --> 01:07:01.676]  Alex, this is too fast.
[01:07:02.217 --> 01:07:07.060]  I was expecting gold to be between $1,200 and $1,300 an ounce before we turned to January 1.
[01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:13.402]  I don't think, you know, I think the chances are we'll be well over 1,300 just because it happened so soon.
[01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:16.769]  Well, this is, again...
[01:07:18.866 --> 01:07:22.390]  A bad thing overall because this means they are planning to kill the dollar.
[01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:24.172]  There's no longer any denial.
[01:07:24.212 --> 01:07:30.438]  The IMF, the World Bank, the UN, our own government have said before they were debating should they kill the dollar.
[01:07:30.878 --> 01:07:32.841]  Now they're saying how are we going to kill it?
[01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:34.062]  We are going to kill it.
[01:07:35.143 --> 01:07:39.407]  And it looks like they're going to engage in this accelerated but still incremental
[01:07:40.367 --> 01:07:40.587]  I think?
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.920]  Gold isn't really going up.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.941]  The dollar is beginning to die.
[01:08:01.001 --> 01:08:03.122]  It's long, painful death in front of us.
[01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:18.126]  I didn't ask you this question before I got you live today, Ted, before you pitched people this great opportunity, and I hope they take advantage of it, just like I did when gold was $260, $270 an ounce, and I was pitching it to people saying it was only going to go up because all the economic real data showed that.
[01:08:19.246 --> 01:08:23.870]  Last week you said you were almost out of gold you bought at the $1,050 level.
[01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:26.612]  Now gold is at $1,200.
[01:08:27.052 --> 01:08:35.418]  Tell us the last buys you did and what you have left, if any, at that super low price or what your new low price is now that it's gone up.
[01:08:35.759 --> 01:08:37.660]  Well, averaging at about $1,130 an ounce.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.602]  I mean, I was trying to buy into the dips.
[01:08:40.662 --> 01:08:42.544]  I didn't get too many this last time around.
[01:08:42.584 --> 01:08:44.185]  I didn't get to buy that much product.
[01:08:44.645 --> 01:08:56.070]  But one of the things that I picked up a couple of million dollars worth here a few months ago were those Walking Liberty halves, and I am at the very, very bottom end of what I have, and that was when Silver was about 16.
[01:08:56.710 --> 01:09:04.654]  And right now, it'll be the very last day because anything I commit to today is going to put me upside down, so I'm changing it at midnight.
[01:09:05.234 --> 01:09:08.496]  And that would be the price of the Walking Liberty half.
[01:09:08.516 --> 01:09:10.177]  They're at $8.69 right now.
[01:09:10.538 --> 01:09:13.880]  They'll be well over $9 a piece starting tomorrow.
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:18.363]  So if you want to take advantage of something that's on its way up, there's a good buy for you.
[01:09:18.643 --> 01:09:21.245]  So you made a mega buy of silver months ago.
[01:09:21.725 --> 01:09:25.488]  Silver is way above what you bought it for at that time.
[01:09:25.608 --> 01:09:30.871]  So you're literally... I've never heard of a deal that good on silver, but you're saying this is it.
[01:09:32.132 --> 01:09:34.534]  Alex, I've been holding these prices since August.
[01:09:35.174 --> 01:09:37.255]  So that'll give you an idea of where it's been.
[01:09:37.295 --> 01:09:40.037]  Silver at that time was about $16 an ounce.
[01:09:40.437 --> 01:09:45.720]  And right now, silver's at $19 and has been as high as $19.30 an ounce.
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:47.961]  Okay, explain that to me.
[01:09:48.281 --> 01:09:53.164]  If you're selling silver at $8.60, what cents?
[01:09:54.325 --> 01:09:57.186]  Presently, right now, it is the Walking Liberty half there at $8.69.
[01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:58.347]  Okay, so literally, you're selling it
[01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:13.965]  For what silver cost right now, which nobody can ever do because there's the added price of shipping, and there's the added price of you having to buy it, and there's the added price of it being in coin form.
[01:10:14.345 --> 01:10:19.072]  Right, everything carries a bit of a premium, but this here is just like buying in that spot.
[01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:20.073]  I mean, it really is.
[01:10:21.515 --> 01:10:24.938]  The silver, the walking liberty half is half the size of the U.S.
[01:10:25.018 --> 01:10:25.399]  dollar.
[01:10:25.939 --> 01:10:26.500]  And the U.S.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.224]  dollar, silver dollars from the turn of the century right now are trading upwards.
[01:10:31.605 --> 01:10:35.228]  Right now they're just poking into the $26 level apiece.
[01:10:35.649 --> 01:10:39.773]  And so these right now are just incredibly, I mean... Ted, quickly tell folks about...
[01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:48.721]  The gold that I have left, the stuff that's going to be sitting at the lower price range is the $10 Liberty at $8.65.
[01:10:49.161 --> 01:10:51.663]  The Franks currently right now at $2.63.
[01:10:51.963 --> 01:10:53.885]  The British Sovereign at $3.25.
[01:10:54.205 --> 01:10:56.487]  Those all reflect the older prices in gold.
[01:10:56.587 --> 01:10:59.289]  So I haven't had a chance to increase those prices yet.
[01:10:59.649 --> 01:11:03.332]  I won't until my material or my inventory is sold.
[01:11:04.492 --> 01:11:09.335]  But I'll have to, because now at $1,200 gold, there's no way I can sell those at those prices.
[01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:16.678]  So let's be clear, you still have gold you bought at the $1,050 level, with at $150-plus above that right now.
[01:11:17.218 --> 01:11:22.381]  Ted, that is, because you keep breaking every record, this is your all-time best deal ever.
[01:11:22.641 --> 01:11:26.643]  Yeah, but just a few of the items that I have left are in that particular price range.
[01:11:26.943 --> 01:11:31.105]  Folks, you gotta tell them Alex Jones sent you, or you'll be paying the higher price.
[01:11:31.165 --> 01:11:32.085]  It's still a great deal.
[01:11:32.105 --> 01:11:33.046]  800-686-2237.
[01:11:33.066 --> 01:11:35.147]  800-686-2237.
[01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:38.968]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:40.189]  Don't be foolish.
[01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:41.929]  This is a wonderful deal.
[01:11:41.969 --> 01:11:45.191]  It's like getting in a time machine and going back a few months ago to buy cheaper gold.
[01:11:46.091 --> 01:11:46.171]  800-686-2237.
[01:11:46.211 --> 01:11:50.353]  Here's that number one more time.
[01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:50.754]  800-686-2237.
[01:11:50.854 --> 01:11:55.156]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:11:55.416 --> 01:11:56.837]  The brokers will be there till midnight.
[01:11:56.997 --> 01:11:57.937]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[01:11:58.077 --> 01:11:58.878]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[01:12:00.772 --> 01:12:03.074]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.936]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[01:12:05.096 --> 01:12:06.878]  NoMoreMortgage can change your life.
[01:12:06.938 --> 01:12:08.279]  We paid off all of our bills.

[01:12:16.828 --> 01:12:18.409]  Even have more money left over each month?
[01:12:18.509 --> 01:12:21.072]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[01:12:21.112 --> 01:12:21.552]  NoMoreMortgage.
[01:12:23.594 --> 01:12:24.815]  Where have they been all of our life?
[01:12:24.875 --> 01:12:27.297]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:31.000]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.382]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.

[01:13:00.801 --> 01:13:08.284]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author, Robert Beatles, wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[01:13:08.565 --> 01:13:14.327]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for six bucks, or the book for ten bucks.
[01:13:14.628 --> 01:13:17.289]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:13:17.589 --> 01:13:23.514]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:13:23.854 --> 01:13:27.717]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:13:27.918 --> 01:13:33.302]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:35.364]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:13:35.624 --> 01:13:37.025]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:13:37.366 --> 01:13:39.648]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:13:39.908 --> 01:13:44.273]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:13:44.633 --> 01:13:47.916]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:13:48.256 --> 01:13:50.879]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:13:51.379 --> 01:13:52.801]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:13:53.261 --> 01:13:55.503]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:14:01.013 --> 01:14:01.853]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:14:02.033 --> 01:14:07.395]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:14:07.575 --> 01:14:07.996]  I get it.
[01:14:08.116 --> 01:14:17.499]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:14:17.739 --> 01:14:18.919]  That's not what's happening.
[01:14:19.139 --> 01:14:23.521]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[01:14:23.741 --> 01:14:25.402]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[01:14:25.582 --> 01:14:27.404]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:14:27.604 --> 01:14:30.886]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:14:31.006 --> 01:14:35.089]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:14:35.269 --> 01:14:36.850]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:40.112]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:14:40.833 --> 01:14:44.455]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:14:44.655 --> 01:14:45.376]  You should, too.
[01:14:45.556 --> 01:14:46.537]  Find out what they know.
[01:14:46.697 --> 01:14:50.059]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:14:50.079 --> 01:14:50.119]  800-686-2237.
[01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:53.101]  800-686-2237.
[01:14:53.141 --> 01:14:53.421]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:14:53.461 --> 01:14:54.402]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:14:54.482 --> 01:14:56.162]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:15:05.808 --> 01:15:18.518]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to Fluscam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[01:15:19.279 --> 01:15:30.848]  Learn why Barack Obama's ScienceR recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[01:15:31.628 --> 01:15:34.270]  OxySilver is far safer than colloidal silvers.
[01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:38.532]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting you and your family.
[01:15:38.832 --> 01:15:41.713]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.

[01:16:00.803 --> 01:16:06.444]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:16:24.529 --> 01:16:26.549]  Let's go to Derek in Hawaii.
[01:16:27.089 --> 01:16:28.410]  I'll say aloha to Derek.
[01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:29.330]  Derek, welcome.
[01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.990]  Mr. Jones.
[01:16:31.391 --> 01:16:31.911]  Hey, buddy.
[01:16:32.071 --> 01:16:32.831]  Pleasure to be on your show.
[01:16:33.992 --> 01:16:35.433]  I'm personally an Oath Keeper.
[01:16:36.213 --> 01:16:37.494]  You know, all that kind of jazz.
[01:16:37.534 --> 01:16:39.095]  Hopefully the noise back here doesn't distract you.
[01:16:39.775 --> 01:16:42.237]  Basically, I just wanted to come on and talk about the whole Climategate thing.
[01:16:43.237 --> 01:16:49.621]  One thing I've been thinking about is we've got all these new, hopefully, new congressmen that'll be coming in next year during the elections.
[01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:52.010]  I was just wondering what your thoughts might be on that.
[01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:55.011]  Hopefully it'll blow this thing bigger because we have all these cold features.
[01:16:55.071 --> 01:16:59.292]  Yes, in Australia, the number two party's leader just got in a bunch of trouble.
[01:16:59.372 --> 01:17:06.474]  A bunch of people resigned and it looks like an anti-man-made global warming party may take over Australia.
[01:17:06.834 --> 01:17:10.435]  It's a giant scandal in New Zealand because they're already carbon taxing people.
[01:17:10.855 --> 01:17:13.796]  Family farms and ranches are just shutting down.
[01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:17.797]  There was articles in New Zealand where hundreds of sheep farmers who've had
[01:17:18.357 --> 01:17:22.872]  Sheep farms for over a hundred years, three, four generations, just said, you know what?
[01:17:24.096 --> 01:17:24.417]  I am.
[01:17:25.299 --> 01:17:34.763]  We're going to stop sheep farming because there was a $200 in New Zealand money, $200 fee each year per sheep.
[01:17:34.843 --> 01:17:37.444]  And the guy said, this is designed to put me out of business.
[01:17:37.464 --> 01:17:40.325]  I don't make $200 a year per sheep, period.
[01:17:40.785 --> 01:17:44.707]  Shearing them for the wool or the few we sell for mutton for slaughter.
[01:17:46.088 --> 01:17:51.550]  Look, the UN says they want to end industrial society and bankrupt you by design.
[01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:54.011]  And yes, we do need
[01:17:55.202 --> 01:18:02.605]  Look, instead of having a hearing about these two morons that crashed the White House party, why don't we have a congressional hearing about Climategate?
[01:18:03.365 --> 01:18:06.026]  I mean, we need to bring these criminals to justice.
[01:18:06.066 --> 01:18:07.727]  We have the smoking gun.
[01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:08.668]  What say ye to that?
[01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:14.670]  You're absolutely correct, Mr. Jones, and I think that, you know, you said it in the Obama description and endgame.
[01:18:15.211 --> 01:18:28.098]  And call the Republic, where they use all these public distractions like, you know, your MTV's and all that jazz to distract people from, you know, what they really want to hear, but instead they want to see these two folks who came in and crashed Barack Obama's dinner party, you know.
[01:18:29.199 --> 01:18:30.059]  Is that gunfire?
[01:18:30.079 --> 01:18:32.100]  It is, I'm sorry.
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.061]  I'm at the range today.
[01:18:33.641 --> 01:18:34.241]  No, that's fine.
[01:18:34.281 --> 01:18:35.902]  So are you a policeman or in the military?
[01:18:36.663 --> 01:18:37.063]  Military.
[01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:40.825]  Are the, I love that sound, the sound of freedom.
[01:18:42.915 --> 01:18:46.316]  The sound of gunfire in the morning, it smells like victory.
[01:18:48.177 --> 01:18:49.758]  Are the troops starting to wake up?
[01:18:51.398 --> 01:18:58.701]  Well, I myself personally, myself and my wife have been both in passing out all the republic throughout all of our units.
[01:18:59.461 --> 01:19:11.446]  I've talked to probably about 15 people who said they've recently just joined the Oath Keepers, but I know that it's starting to wake up because people are looking at all this stuff going on and saying, well, that may not be right, you know?
[01:19:13.263 --> 01:19:15.745]  You know, the founder... Go ahead.
[01:19:16.626 --> 01:19:22.350]  I honestly believe that everyone, or I would hope that most people who joined the military joined for that oath that they took, you know?
[01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:25.633]  I swear to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[01:19:25.653 --> 01:19:27.294]  I mean, it's foreign and domestic, you know?
[01:19:27.954 --> 01:19:30.877]  And these people are starting to wake up.
[01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:39.755]  Instead, the MIAC and Homeland Security reports that we broke earlier this year say the domestic enemies are veterans and gun owners and libertarians.
[01:19:40.155 --> 01:19:42.476]  Did that wake anybody up in the military?
[01:19:42.717 --> 01:19:45.758]  That NORTHCOM and Homeland Security is really for the American people?
[01:19:46.959 --> 01:19:48.560]  I mean, I personally believe so.
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:55.644]  A lot of people I've shown to follow the Republic, some of them they know that, a lot of them here are brainwashed and they say, yeah, I can't wait to go back to Afghanistan.
[01:19:55.664 --> 01:19:56.845]  I can't wait to go back to Iraq.
[01:19:57.265 --> 01:20:00.247]  And they just, they have this mentality that's just way off kilter.
[01:20:00.885 --> 01:20:05.069]  And I talked to a couple people about martial law and stuff, and they said they'd have no problem with it.
[01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:14.919]  Because, you know, a lot of people here, and this is another thing I thought about, a lot of people here in Hawaii, they're far away from home, so they don't mind imposing martial law on people that they don't know.
[01:20:15.459 --> 01:20:20.204]  So then I, and because it's just, it's the same exact thing as when they go to Iraq and Afghanistan and they police that state.
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:25.522]  If they've imposed martial law here, it's just people they don't know, people different than what they are.
[01:20:25.542 --> 01:20:36.347]  But then when I ask them the question, well how about when, you know, Joe Blow, just like you, is imposing martial law and stopping your mom at a checkpoint, stopping your father, your wife, your kids at a checkpoint, what then?
[01:20:36.367 --> 01:20:37.368]  And they, whoa, you know...
[01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:39.061]  Oh, that's probably not so good.
[01:20:39.622 --> 01:20:47.865]  So, I think that... Yeah, do they understand that criminal banks have hijacked the country, an open world government, and the end of our freedom is being announced?
[01:20:47.905 --> 01:20:52.927]  I mean, do they understand that they'd better relearn what it is to be an American really fast?
[01:20:54.267 --> 01:20:56.188]  Uh, I would hope most of them do.
[01:20:56.248 --> 01:20:59.929]  A lot of people I've shown a lot of Obama deception to and follow the Republic.
[01:21:00.370 --> 01:21:03.751]  They think that, uh, you know, some of them take it to heart.
[01:21:03.851 --> 01:21:06.012]  A lot of them think, oh, that's just crazy conspiracy junk.
[01:21:06.032 --> 01:21:06.692]  You're not one of those.
[01:21:07.159 --> 01:21:09.580]  9-11 truth seekers and all that jazz.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:15.062]  It frustrates me, that's why I'm personally getting out.
[01:21:17.282 --> 01:21:23.184]  I think overall, there is a large number of people in the military who are waking up.
[01:21:23.204 --> 01:21:30.727]  There was a person in the military who showed me Endgame, and then from there I just spiraled downward into the world of Mr. Jones.
[01:21:32.981 --> 01:21:40.143]  I've slowly but surely started opening people's eyes to this kind of stuff, but you always have your naysayers, and there's plenty of them in the military.
[01:21:40.163 --> 01:21:41.063]  God bless you, Derek.
[01:21:41.483 --> 01:21:42.423]  Good to hear from you.
[01:21:42.443 --> 01:21:43.304]  Keep spreading the word.
[01:21:43.364 --> 01:21:44.044]  I salute you.
[01:21:44.624 --> 01:21:47.124]  You haven't spiraled down into the world of Jones.
[01:21:47.525 --> 01:21:50.685]  You've climbed the mountain over the mist to see reality.
[01:21:50.825 --> 01:21:51.746]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.226 --> 01:21:53.806]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.746 --> 01:21:57.407]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:06.442]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[01:23:01.371 --> 01:23:05.014]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:23:05.034 --> 01:23:08.397]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:23:08.617 --> 01:23:13.401]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:19.687]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:23:19.827 --> 01:23:22.069]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:23:22.589 --> 01:23:23.990]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:24.711]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:23:24.731 --> 01:23:26.852]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:23:41.482 --> 01:23:43.344]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:23:43.624 --> 01:23:48.469]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:57.879]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:59.941 --> 01:24:09.043]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:24:09.083 --> 01:24:12.203]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:24:12.443 --> 01:24:18.145]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:24:18.305 --> 01:24:22.805]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:24:23.086 --> 01:24:25.426]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:24:25.726 --> 01:24:34.769]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:24:34.909 --> 01:24:40.351]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:42.272]  Help others and earn extra income!
[01:24:42.372 --> 01:24:42.572]  Thank you.
[01:25:22.239 --> 01:25:27.000]  We're lining up Colonel Craig Roberts to be on air with us here in just a few minutes.
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:28.701]  We will continue with your calls.
[01:25:28.821 --> 01:25:33.722]  Andrew, Ron, Joni, Brandon, Rod, and many others.
[01:25:33.742 --> 01:25:44.345]  But we'll talk with him about ClimateGate first, the whole New World Order system, because he's been in Army Intelligence, Marine Corps Sniper, Police Officer, SWAT Team Commander, Helicopter Pilot.
[01:25:44.365 --> 01:25:45.025]  That's coming up.
[01:25:46.377 --> 01:25:50.242]  I wanted to first tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible.
[01:25:50.382 --> 01:25:55.149]  One of them is Diginet.net audio video recorders.
[01:25:55.169 --> 01:25:58.153]  They have sunglasses with video and audio.
[01:25:58.213 --> 01:26:00.676]  You can't even tell it's there.
[01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:02.359]  Incredible hidden system.
[01:26:02.379 --> 01:26:03.881]  Shoots great video wherever you're looking.
[01:26:05.265 --> 01:26:09.728]  They have little pins where you press one button and it shoots audio and video with a time stamp.
[01:26:09.828 --> 01:26:10.549]  Great for court.
[01:26:10.609 --> 01:26:11.890]  Great for records of things.
[01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:14.132]  Great to protect yourself against Big Brother.
[01:26:14.532 --> 01:26:18.695]  Because the system will shoot you, will attack you, will beat you, will lie about you.
[01:26:20.336 --> 01:26:21.057]  In many cases.
[01:26:21.237 --> 01:26:27.662]  And if you secretly record them and have it later and prove they were lying, wait until they falsely charge you, you can destroy them.
[01:26:28.542 --> 01:26:29.903]  And justice can be served.
[01:26:30.624 --> 01:26:35.469]  So there's so many great reasons to have the Diginet.net recording system.
[01:26:35.509 --> 01:26:38.832]  Check out their website, Diginet.net today.
[01:26:38.852 --> 01:26:45.698]  A whole bunch of great products and materials and information at Diginet.net or go to InfoWars.com.
[01:26:46.019 --> 01:26:50.283]  There is a banner, D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:26:51.837 --> 01:26:59.922]  Continuing here with other sponsors, survivalseedbank.com, from the great folks at Solutions from Science, with all of the craziness going on.
[01:26:59.963 --> 01:27:09.229]  The globalists are about one thing, making you dependent on them, collectivizing our country, getting you off the rural areas, destroying farming, destroying ranching.
[01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:14.192]  Everyone should start planting a garden, even if you have a tiny backyard.
[01:27:14.272 --> 01:27:20.616]  It's fun, your children will love it, and these are non-GMO, non-hybrid, organic seeds
[01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:22.538]  That they have.
[01:27:24.259 --> 01:27:26.220]  And so it is so important.
[01:27:30.722 --> 01:27:35.664]  It is so important that everyone visit survivalseedbank.com
[01:27:37.617 --> 01:27:41.338]  Seeds in the Survival Seed Bank are hand-picked for exceptional germination rates.
[01:27:41.438 --> 01:27:43.639]  Order a couple of seed banks today while you still can.
[01:27:43.979 --> 01:27:45.559]  Go to survivalseedbank.com.

[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.300]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.180]  Banners up on infowars.com as well.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:51.280]  Okay.
[01:28:03.916 --> 01:28:13.818]  For the balance of the radio broadcast today, we have Colonel Craig Roberts on the line with us, and I want to go over his bio.
[01:28:14.978 --> 01:28:17.579]  His website is RifleWarrior.com.
[01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:33.042]  Craig Roberts is also recognized authority on firearms and marksmanship, doing his military background, police background, and participation in marksmanship matches with both police and military, plus writing three books, which were bestsellers on various aspects of marksmanship via oral histories by people who have been there.
[01:28:34.452 --> 01:28:48.977]  And he's been a keynote speaker with various law enforcement and military organizations, have appeared in five history program shows, history channel programs, secret missions, suicide missions, snipers, and it just goes on and on.
[01:28:48.997 --> 01:28:52.158]  He also investigated the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:28:52.218 --> 01:28:59.261]  He was SWAT team commander, helicopter pilot for a police department, Oklahoma City bombing investigator, sniper.
[01:29:00.652 --> 01:29:19.291]  Marine Corps sniper in Vietnam and I've had a chance to speak with him at some events to get to know him over the last decade that I've been interviewing him more than a decade now how time flies and so I want to talk about the latest Oklahoma City developments new information to come out on that the last eight months or so she's been on I want to talk about the cap-and-trade carbon tax
[01:29:20.373 --> 01:29:24.277]  Scandal as the UN internal documents have come out where they want world government.
[01:29:24.577 --> 01:29:26.499]  They know man-made global warming isn't real.
[01:29:26.539 --> 01:29:27.560]  They know it's a fraud.
[01:29:28.041 --> 01:29:29.422]  This is their planetary tax.
[01:29:29.842 --> 01:29:35.428]  I want to get into Obama, North Com announcing they want to put regular troops on the streets now happening incrementally.
[01:29:36.289 --> 01:29:44.113]  Some of his family at West Point getting speeches from Wesley Clark, admitting they want to use foreign troops in America.
[01:29:44.613 --> 01:29:53.997]  NLEO 9, four months ago, FEMA's own website admitting troops from 14 different nations here, quote, trying to take on American terrorists.
[01:29:54.397 --> 01:30:01.660]  The MIAC report, the Homeland Security reports that we released, that two state police officers gave us separately from California and Missouri.
[01:30:02.201 --> 01:30:04.542]  Another one was a federal marshal that gave us the material.
[01:30:05.302 --> 01:30:14.068]  Saying that veterans, gun owners, conservatives, Ron Paul supporters, people that want to audit the Fed, are the main terror threat in America and want homeland security.
[01:30:15.347 --> 01:30:17.348]  And Northcom are really set up for it.
[01:30:17.388 --> 01:30:24.510]  Colonel Craig Roberts years ago, five, six years ago, exposed that here on air because he has so many military and police sources.
[01:30:24.570 --> 01:30:33.173]  And a lot of his, he's retired now, a lot of his Tulsa, Oklahoma police department buddies and state police buddies would laugh at him deer hunting 10 years ago about the New World Order.
[01:30:33.453 --> 01:30:34.514]  They're not laughing now.
[01:30:34.554 --> 01:30:37.135]  They're calling him up wanting to understand what's happening.
[01:30:37.615 --> 01:30:42.716]  So without further ado, Colonel Craig Roberts for the balance of the radio transmission.
[01:30:42.997 --> 01:30:44.137]  Craig, it's great to have you with us.
[01:30:44.477 --> 01:30:45.538]  Hi Alex, good to be back.
[01:30:46.759 --> 01:30:47.559]  Where to start?
[01:30:47.679 --> 01:31:02.929]  I mean, you know, we've gone from being called kooks to conspiracy theorists because we know how to read Club of Rome, UN documents, textbooks written by the White House, science czar, like eco-science, because nobody would look at this stuff, to now it's finally being announced.
[01:31:03.009 --> 01:31:04.170]  I mean, where do we start?
[01:31:04.930 --> 01:31:09.473]  Well, you know, it's really hard because it all depends on which tentacle of the octopus you want to grab.
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:14.683]  Uh, you know, there's so many organizations involved that interlink on this deal because
[01:31:18.144 --> 01:31:33.012]  Organization that's trying to bring in this new world order of theirs has been around for, you know, over 200 years, but what they've finally done is they've finally created enough different organizations interlinked to handle their logistical and their political problems that they had in the past.
[01:31:33.072 --> 01:31:34.733]  Before, you know, you had separate nations.
[01:31:35.393 --> 01:31:36.074]  You had borders.
[01:31:36.094 --> 01:31:38.895]  You had everybody taking care of themselves, but they've taken all that away.
[01:31:38.915 --> 01:31:39.956]  They've gotten rid of the borders.
[01:31:40.676 --> 01:31:42.717]  They're combining the monetary institutions.
[01:31:43.558 --> 01:31:55.525]  They're doing everything they can to destroy the first world and redistribute the wealth to the third world, so they lower us down to second world status, bring the third world up to second world status, and then they've succeeded with their New World Order.
[01:31:56.225 --> 01:32:01.030]  I mean, almost all the dominoes have fallen over on this deal, except us.
[01:32:01.090 --> 01:32:01.711]  And we're next.
[01:32:02.051 --> 01:32:03.973]  And they're doing a pretty good job with it right now.
[01:32:04.013 --> 01:32:05.895]  They're going a lot faster than I ever thought they would.
[01:32:05.955 --> 01:32:10.180]  I figured it would be another few years before they would get as far as they did this year alone.
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:17.988]  So we're seeing more things happen with this bunch of Washington we've got right now that is totally trying to destroy this country.
[01:32:18.568 --> 01:32:22.311]  With very few people able to slow them down or stop them.
[01:32:22.691 --> 01:32:23.452]  It's just incredible.
[01:32:23.612 --> 01:32:26.754]  I mean, it's almost like we just have to sit in the grandstands and watch it happen, Alex.
[01:32:26.794 --> 01:32:29.016]  And, you know, we talked about this years ago.
[01:32:29.056 --> 01:32:29.656]  You and I did.
[01:32:29.756 --> 01:32:32.258]  We tried getting on the radio and telling people about it.
[01:32:32.618 --> 01:32:35.940]  Like you said, there's people who call in and say, no, this could never happen here.
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:40.944]  And, you know, I had people in our own special operations or special investigations division of the police department.
[01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:46.220]  That we're watching me, because they're saying, this Roberts guy, he's nuts.
[01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.863]  He's talking about all this weird stuff.
[01:32:47.904 --> 01:32:50.269]  You know, he's talking about this new world order he's talking about.
[01:32:50.859 --> 01:32:54.680]  You know, the Rothschild plan and all the rest of it.
[01:32:55.321 --> 01:32:56.621]  We've got to watch this guy.
[01:32:56.681 --> 01:32:57.701]  He's off the range here.
[01:32:58.162 --> 01:33:03.343]  And now, about six or eight months ago, one of those guys came to me.
[01:33:03.383 --> 01:33:04.024]  He's retired now.
[01:33:04.064 --> 01:33:08.905]  He says, you know, they all thought you were nuts back then, and now they think you're way ahead of your time.
[01:33:08.925 --> 01:33:09.906]  You're an actual prophet.
[01:33:09.986 --> 01:33:11.846]  And I said, all they had to do was do their homework.
[01:33:11.906 --> 01:33:15.808]  All they had to do was read the material that was available out there, and I would have given them some of it.
[01:33:15.928 --> 01:33:17.008]  I'd open my files to them.
[01:33:17.774 --> 01:33:19.916]  But now they're saying, OK, what do we do now?
[01:33:20.496 --> 01:33:21.297]  How do we deal with this?
[01:33:21.657 --> 01:33:22.337]  What do we do?
[01:33:23.298 --> 01:33:27.781]  And I said, well, for a lot of you guys, it's just a little bit too late to start worrying about how to deal with it.
[01:33:28.742 --> 01:33:30.363]  You've got to start preparing.
[01:33:30.383 --> 01:33:31.884]  What are you going to do to protect your family?
[01:33:31.904 --> 01:33:34.126]  What are you going to do to protect your neighbors?
[01:33:34.146 --> 01:33:35.667]  What are you going to do to protect your community?
[01:33:35.707 --> 01:33:37.168]  Because that's what it's going to boil down to.
[01:33:37.228 --> 01:33:42.192]  It's going to have to be a grassroots effort from the bottom up to where this entire country
[01:33:43.005 --> 01:33:53.668]  Uh, has a culture that comes up from the bottom up, educates our kids, educates our friends and neighbors, and then is able to stand up and resist all this globalist activity that's going on.
[01:33:54.368 --> 01:33:56.828]  We're going to have to do something about securing the borders.
[01:33:57.288 --> 01:33:58.889]  You're down there close to the Mexican border.
[01:33:59.369 --> 01:34:00.449]  You know, you're Texas.
[01:34:00.989 --> 01:34:03.870]  I'm sitting here in Oklahoma and we look at Texas as a buffer zone right now.
[01:34:04.545 --> 01:34:08.607]  You know, we passed a law that if you hired an illegal immigrant, you would go to jail.
[01:34:09.447 --> 01:34:14.869]  And so, most of the illegals left Oklahoma, but they went to Texas, they went to Arkansas, they went to Kansas.
[01:34:16.630 --> 01:34:31.416]  But as long as we've got open borders, and we're not doing anything about it, and our own government is discouraging doing anything about it, and actually prosecuting border agents if they do anything about it, we're going to have a problem, because it's an illegal immigrant invasion.
[01:34:32.043 --> 01:34:35.464]  It's not guys coming over here to pick fruit like it was 30 years ago.
[01:34:35.905 --> 01:34:42.227]  It's people coming over here with MS-13, they're coming over with drugs, they're coming over with weapons, and they're smuggling in Islamic terrorists.
[01:34:42.827 --> 01:34:43.868]  It's just wide open.
[01:34:44.508 --> 01:34:46.049]  And so what do we do about that?
[01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.569]  I don't know.
[01:34:46.589 --> 01:34:53.892]  If we're not willing to get the military involved in securing our own borders, then what are we doing with the military?
[01:34:54.452 --> 01:34:56.213]  You know, we've got over, right now,
[01:34:57.176 --> 01:34:58.318]  We've got 1,445,000 troops of all services.
[01:34:58.338 --> 01:35:01.465]  Now, out of that, you've got 1,083,000 stationed inside the United States.
[01:35:10.005 --> 01:35:10.546]  What are they doing?
[01:35:10.926 --> 01:35:14.188]  We need to have our borders protected, and we're not doing it.
[01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:17.691]  I've had people tell me, well, you can't use the military to protect the borders.
[01:35:17.731 --> 01:35:18.832]  I'm going, where did you get that?
[01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:24.356]  That's the primary function of the military in this country, is to protect the borders of this country.
[01:35:24.696 --> 01:35:27.058]  That's the primary defense of the nation.
[01:35:27.538 --> 01:35:29.200]  And it starts at the border, you know.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.942]  It doesn't start in Afghanistan.
[01:35:30.962 --> 01:35:32.684]  It doesn't start in South Korea.
[01:35:32.984 --> 01:35:33.825]  It starts here.
[01:35:34.345 --> 01:35:41.793]  If we have to go someplace else to protect ourselves by taking out enemy elements or the ability to fight or create terrorism, that's fine.
[01:35:42.394 --> 01:35:45.497]  But our main operation for the military is to protect this nation.
[01:35:45.937 --> 01:35:46.617]  And we're not doing it.
[01:35:46.878 --> 01:35:47.878]  We're not using those guys.
[01:35:48.198 --> 01:35:51.760]  We've got governors in border states saying, well, I can use the National Guard to do that.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:52.921]  And they're told, no you can't.
[01:35:53.361 --> 01:35:54.541]  That's U.S.
[01:35:54.601 --> 01:35:54.982]  equipment.
[01:35:55.022 --> 01:35:56.482]  That is not state equipment they've got.
[01:35:56.562 --> 01:35:57.863]  And you're not going to use U.S.
[01:35:57.923 --> 01:36:02.645]  equipment owned by the Army or the Navy or the Marines to go to the border and do this.
[01:36:02.865 --> 01:36:05.747]  Well, let me stop you right there and go back to something you said three minutes ago.
[01:36:07.133 --> 01:36:10.875]  You said we've got to take over the grassroots because they've taken over the high ground.
[01:36:10.895 --> 01:36:13.776]  They've taken over the federal and many of the state governments.
[01:36:13.796 --> 01:36:21.479]  But there is a revolt by the states, re-declaring their 9th and 10th Amendment, not for secession, but to declare states' rights.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:26.922]  And that's why we now have this internal UN document, not just ClimateGate,
[01:36:27.762 --> 01:36:42.237]  But this new internal UN document, two of them, where they admit they've taken over all the universities, they admit in their own words it's a communist system, they admit in here that they've got to be deceptive
[01:36:42.958 --> 01:36:43.178]  I think?
[01:37:02.489 --> 01:37:06.874]  To their parents about taking a hot bath or shower, saying it's too big a carbon footprint.
[01:37:07.254 --> 01:37:11.859]  Al Gore's caught on video and audio teaching school kids to tell your parents what to do.
[01:37:12.239 --> 01:37:15.863]  Kathleen Sebelius has been caught doing it on C-SPAN.
[01:37:16.463 --> 01:37:23.110]  I mean, they admit, they have now, we have a former special forces colonel assigned to black ops.
[01:37:24.418 --> 01:37:33.466]  In Austin, this was in the Statesman, the paper, saying, oh, I now run the new environmental carbon tax, so we have the cities through the U.N.
[01:37:33.506 --> 01:37:35.508]  control with the military.
[01:37:35.988 --> 01:37:50.001]  We have NORTHCOM not just not defending our borders, but saying our real mission is dealing with libertarians and conservatives and veterans and gun owners because they're not going to go along with the new world order.
[01:37:50.401 --> 01:37:50.641]  I mean,
[01:37:51.662 --> 01:37:54.024]  So it's not just that the military isn't allowed to do their job.
[01:37:54.484 --> 01:37:56.685]  You've read the articles about Brigade Homeland.
[01:37:57.426 --> 01:37:59.047]  Tell that story about Wesley Clark.
[01:37:59.987 --> 01:38:00.467]  Or was it...
[01:38:02.156 --> 01:38:04.718]  Yeah, General McCaffrey, that's right.
[01:38:05.359 --> 01:38:08.142]  I read a separate article of Wesley Clark saying foreign troops may be needed.
[01:38:08.402 --> 01:38:09.803]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:38:10.704 --> 01:38:11.545]  Here's the point I'm making.
[01:38:11.805 --> 01:38:14.087]  We've been right this far about what was going to happen.
[01:38:14.568 --> 01:38:15.749]  Get into the foreign troops.
[01:38:15.809 --> 01:38:18.191]  Get into how they're planning to lock things down.
[01:38:18.271 --> 01:38:19.352]  Staged terror attacks.
[01:38:19.632 --> 01:38:20.713]  Blaming on patriots.
[01:38:21.634 --> 01:38:24.036]  We know the next big attacks aren't going to be blamed on Muslims.
[01:38:24.297 --> 01:38:27.820]  It's going to be blamed on people like Craig Roberts and Alex Jones.
[01:38:28.888 --> 01:38:31.731]  Well, you know, they've got to have some kind of a patsy.
[01:38:31.751 --> 01:38:34.833]  They've got to have some type of a scapegoat for everything they do.
[01:38:35.234 --> 01:38:36.715]  It's the old Reichstag fire deal.
[01:38:36.775 --> 01:38:38.697]  It's the Oklahoma City McVeigh-did-it deal.
[01:38:38.737 --> 01:38:39.998]  It's the Kennedy assassination.
[01:38:40.058 --> 01:38:41.519]  Oswald did it by himself deal.
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:45.322]  You know, backed by the Cubans so we can invade Cuba.
[01:38:45.402 --> 01:38:52.729]  I mean, what they do is they set an objective and then they figure out how can they get the American couch potato off the couch to support us in doing this.
[01:38:53.619 --> 01:38:58.944]  Because Americans are the worst ones in the world about sitting around and doing nothing until we get punched in the nose.
[01:38:59.005 --> 01:39:01.147]  It took Pearl Harbor to get us into World War II.
[01:39:01.247 --> 01:39:03.369]  It took Lusitania to get us into World War I.
[01:39:04.411 --> 01:39:10.153]  So, you know, how do we wake up the American people and get them on our side to go do whatever it is we want to do?
[01:39:10.454 --> 01:39:17.656]  And so what they do is they come up with some type of a situation, a terrorist event, whatever, and it could be anything.
[01:39:17.716 --> 01:39:19.397]  I mean, we could see something in the near future.
[01:39:19.597 --> 01:39:27.360]  You know, we're being prepped right now with all of these different reports leaking out of Islamic terrorist types coming across the border.
[01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:29.601]  And I've been in contact with one of the border sheriffs down there.
[01:39:30.551 --> 01:39:44.103]  By the way, they found Muslim prayer rugs, and they found backpacks, and they found Korans, and they found military patches from a commando unit in Syria inside an abandoned ranch house down there near the border where the people just gave up and left.
[01:39:44.224 --> 01:39:46.265]  These people were coming across and staying there at nighttime.
[01:39:47.006 --> 01:39:50.189]  And the deputies drove up in this house, and they just ran off into the desert.
[01:39:50.209 --> 01:39:50.809]  They didn't catch them.
[01:39:50.849 --> 01:39:51.370]  It was at night.
[01:39:52.205 --> 01:40:05.052]  But he put this out, he put it on the internet, he showed pictures of this patch, and I had someone I know who speaks Arabic and all of that, who's from that region, he identified the patch, he said these are Syrian commandos that are coming over here.
[01:40:05.232 --> 01:40:08.754]  And they could be Hezbollah too, because they work out of Syria and Lebanon.
[01:40:09.594 --> 01:40:11.475]  And so they're here, okay?
[01:40:11.715 --> 01:40:18.018]  We're being prepped mentally to expect some type of a jihadist attack here in this country.
[01:40:18.178 --> 01:40:20.880]  And let me stop you again, and then continue along that line.
[01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:40.598]  We're now seeing CNN, Fox, BBC saying the militias and they're having imams that we know are CIA fronts say, we are the Muslim extremists, we're going to release 100 pounds of anthrax, we work with your militias, which is completely made up.
[01:40:41.018 --> 01:40:46.320]  So now they're trying to nexus and tie in the fake McVeigh types with the Muslims.
[01:40:47.081 --> 01:40:49.922]  Yeah, I mean, they're going to, you know, there's how many of them out there?
[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:51.222]  I think so.
[01:40:58.815 --> 01:41:09.898]  That is ready to be used as a throwdown to place the blame on militias, right-wingist Christians, you know, whoever they fear.
[01:41:10.138 --> 01:41:11.358]  And they fear us.
[01:41:11.438 --> 01:41:12.378]  They fear Christians.
[01:41:12.418 --> 01:41:13.659]  They fear conservatives.
[01:41:13.699 --> 01:41:16.039]  They fear patriotic America.
[01:41:16.059 --> 01:41:18.140]  And that's what the MIAC report states.
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:23.941]  I mean, did you get angry when you read the Homeland Security report saying Ron Paul stickers mean you're a terrorist?
[01:41:24.241 --> 01:41:27.645]  Oh yeah, and NRA stickers and all this other stuff, you know.
[01:41:28.005 --> 01:41:29.467]  Anything on there.
[01:41:29.527 --> 01:41:40.198]  I talked to a guy who got stopped in New Mexico and he got stopped simply because he had an NRA sticker on the back of one of his trucks and they wanted to search his truck for guns.
[01:41:40.838 --> 01:41:42.358]  And he said, I'm a farmer.
[01:41:42.659 --> 01:41:45.359]  Yeah, I've got guns because I've got coyotes, you know?
[01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:47.120]  And he says, I'm an American.
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:48.240]  I've got the Second Amendment.
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:52.061]  Well, you've got that extremist sticker in your back window.
[01:41:52.081 --> 01:41:53.541]  And he says, the NRA?
[01:41:54.181 --> 01:41:55.522]  I mean, that's how far it's gone.
[01:41:55.702 --> 01:42:01.543]  The NRA is a constitutionally chartered organization that goes back to Teddy Roosevelt.
[01:42:01.603 --> 01:42:02.764]  It's very patriotic.
[01:42:03.444 --> 01:42:05.504]  Gun owners of America, same thing.
[01:42:05.544 --> 01:42:06.164]  They're very patriotic.
[01:42:08.505 --> 01:42:13.028]  Yeah, because we stand in the way of what they want to do, because we are the last domino.
[01:42:13.048 --> 01:42:13.828]  Look, Europe's gone.
[01:42:27.342 --> 01:42:28.182]  The UK is gone.
[01:42:28.202 --> 01:42:29.403]  Australia's gone.
[01:42:29.783 --> 01:42:30.923]  Canada's almost gone.
[01:42:30.943 --> 01:42:32.984]  I mean, with the gun control laws they've got up there.
[01:42:33.024 --> 01:42:36.185]  There's a lot of rebels up in Canada that are saying, I'm not going to do it.
[01:42:37.165 --> 01:42:38.025]  Come and get my guns.
[01:42:38.085 --> 01:42:41.927]  But what's the population?
[01:42:43.047 --> 01:42:43.807]  Mexico's gone.
[01:42:44.147 --> 01:42:45.348]  Central and South America's gone.
[01:42:45.548 --> 01:42:48.969]  All of those places are so corrupt, they're controlled with the banks.
[01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:50.591]  Stay there, Colonel.
[01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:54.898]  I want to hear from your Army Intelligence angle and what you're hearing from your colleagues.
[01:42:55.218 --> 01:42:57.682]  Where all this is going and what we should do to get ready.

[01:44:01.636 --> 01:44:05.304]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:05.685 --> 01:44:08.691]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:08.912 --> 01:44:10.335]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:44:11.027 --> 01:44:13.689]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:19.953]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:20.113 --> 01:44:25.116]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:25.656 --> 01:44:35.262]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:35.382 --> 01:44:37.503]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:37.743 --> 01:44:39.063]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:39.324 --> 01:44:41.604]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:41.784 --> 01:44:43.625]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:43.905 --> 01:44:48.727]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.471]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:45:05.911 --> 01:45:06.351]  Don't!
[01:45:06.771 --> 01:45:09.812]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:45:10.213 --> 01:45:18.996]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.

[01:45:47.852 --> 01:45:48.052]  That's 888-352-7726.
[01:45:48.072 --> 01:45:48.112]  888-352-7726.
[01:45:48.132 --> 01:45:50.694]  Well, the union's a big business, baby.
[01:45:50.874 --> 01:45:53.075]  And it's going down like a dinosaur.
[01:46:13.009 --> 01:46:27.297]  All right, Colonel Craig Roberts, best-selling author, police officer, Oklahoma City investigator, helicopter pilot, Marine Corps sniper.
[01:46:27.957 --> 01:46:28.718]  He's done a lot.
[01:46:30.559 --> 01:46:34.341]  And also retired out of the Army as an Army colonel.
[01:46:36.704 --> 01:46:36.784]  Yeah.
[01:46:55.322 --> 01:46:56.242]  Well, Alex, I think it would be
[01:47:24.091 --> 01:47:24.992]  Even less than that.
[01:47:25.052 --> 01:47:29.816]  I think we're within six months of a total financial collapse in this country.
[01:47:29.876 --> 01:47:33.058]  You've got the Chinese buying up all the gold they can, dumping the dollar.
[01:47:33.659 --> 01:47:38.543]  I've got contacts down in South America who are saying that no one wants to deal in the dollar anymore.
[01:47:38.583 --> 01:47:43.147]  They want to deal in the euro, and they want to deal in the Swiss franc, and that sort of thing.
[01:47:43.912 --> 01:47:44.392]  I don't know.
[01:48:03.274 --> 01:48:04.756]  They won't say where it went!
[01:48:04.776 --> 01:48:05.396]  On record!
[01:48:23.905 --> 01:48:24.165]  No.
[01:48:24.665 --> 01:48:28.486]  And never got down to the people who, you know, it was supposed to help.
[01:48:28.526 --> 01:48:38.348]  I mean, you had all these people losing their homes that wanted to refinance at a different interest rate at lower payments, and they would stay in their homes, and they could still do that, and the mortgage companies wouldn't budge on it.
[01:48:38.428 --> 01:48:40.568]  Instead, they went through foreclosures.
[01:48:41.488 --> 01:48:49.450]  You know, you've got the unions who supported this guy, because the unions are pretty much controlled by, you know, communists and socialists anyway, and have been, you know, since the beginning.
[01:48:49.950 --> 01:49:02.033]  So what I'm getting from you, and I want you to elaborate on this, but I've never heard this from you, and I don't think it's a defeatist attitude, but I believe you're saying, we've been overrun, now you're saying batten down the hatches, get ready for basically the Red Terror?
[01:49:02.073 --> 01:49:03.073]  I think where we're at right now is
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:25.185]  The next thing we could see could very easily be a terrorist or a series of terrorist events in this country.
[01:49:26.106 --> 01:49:31.730]  There's two possible scenarios here, and you could probably even have both of them at the same time.
[01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:34.712]  One is a financial collapse, and the other is a terrorist event.
[01:49:34.752 --> 01:49:43.039]  It could be a biological, it could be a nuclear, you know, some backpack nukes that they've smuggled across the Mexican border or brought in through Canada or whatever.
[01:49:43.659 --> 01:49:50.102]  If they have anything at all, and whether they blame it on the militias, you know, like militias have a whole lot of Nike suits.
[01:49:50.122 --> 01:49:51.862]  But you've never really talked like this.
[01:49:51.903 --> 01:49:53.863]  You're really seeing a convergence of things.
[01:49:54.143 --> 01:49:56.965]  You think they're about to jump to an even greater acceleration.
[01:49:57.285 --> 01:50:00.346]  Well, I think the next stage, if I were them planning,
[01:50:00.956 --> 01:50:05.702]  I would have to start by destroying the people's ability to do anything except be dependent on me, the government.
[01:50:18.697 --> 01:50:28.544]  And to make them dependent on me, they've got to be dependent on me for the financial situation, their food situation, their water situation, their ability to travel, and their ability to communicate.
[01:50:28.564 --> 01:50:29.144]  All right, stay there.
[01:50:29.164 --> 01:50:29.664]  We've got a break.
[01:50:29.724 --> 01:50:30.465]  Back in one minute.
[01:50:30.545 --> 01:50:34.888]  So they're going with the linen model, the Mao Tse Tung model, the Pol Pot model.
[01:50:34.988 --> 01:50:35.488]  I agree.
[01:50:35.788 --> 01:50:38.230]  Their own documents state they want us totally broke.
[01:50:38.250 --> 01:50:42.132]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:50:50.575 --> 01:50:53.176]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:50:53.596 --> 01:50:58.557]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:50:58.917 --> 01:51:00.657]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:51:00.957 --> 01:51:05.779]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:51:05.959 --> 01:51:06.919]  How much do you want?
[01:51:07.139 --> 01:51:07.899]  When do you want it?
[01:51:08.279 --> 01:51:09.879]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:10.980]  When will you need it?
[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:13.300]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:14.541]  Will there be any food?
[01:51:14.761 --> 01:51:16.101]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:51:16.301 --> 01:51:16.561]  If there's
[01:51:16.561 --> 01:51:18.683]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:51:18.843 --> 01:51:21.365]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:51:21.565 --> 01:51:24.748]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:51:25.148 --> 01:51:28.651]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:51:28.972 --> 01:51:29.953]  How much will you need?
[01:51:30.193 --> 01:51:30.813]  We don't know.
[01:51:31.094 --> 01:51:32.014]  How much do you want?
[01:51:32.195 --> 01:51:32.935]  All you can get.
[01:51:32.955 --> 01:51:33.816]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:34.216 --> 01:51:36.979]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:51:37.259 --> 01:51:39.441]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:51:39.461 --> 01:51:40.462]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:40.482 --> 01:51:41.643]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:41.683 --> 01:51:43.504]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:12.478 --> 01:52:13.819]  What's the head of the Octopus?
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:16.962]  It runs all the major religious extremist organizations.
[01:52:17.323 --> 01:52:22.508]  It runs all the major militaries, the intelligence bureaus, through compartmentalization.
[01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:24.910]  What is the master plan?
[01:52:25.110 --> 01:52:26.131]  What is the endgame?
[01:52:26.411 --> 01:52:27.833]  Colonel Craig Roberts, our guest.
[01:52:27.873 --> 01:52:28.133]  Colonel.
[01:52:28.888 --> 01:52:32.732]  Well, you know, Alex, I brought this up, I think it was last year sometime.
[01:52:33.973 --> 01:52:39.018]  I found out about it about five years ago when I wrote my book, Killzone, about the Kennedy assassination.
[01:52:39.639 --> 01:52:47.587]  I chased, you know, who would benefit, who would profit, who had the capability of pulling it off, and then covered it up no matter who was in the White House until, you know, 2029.
[01:52:48.008 --> 01:52:51.111]  Because that's when they said they would release whatever records they had.
[01:52:51.907 --> 01:52:57.815]  And I kept chasing, you know, who would benefit, who, you know, met all that criteria up above the White House.
[01:52:57.875 --> 01:53:02.521]  Was there an entity above the White House that could actually control the entire country, no matter who was in office?
[01:53:02.542 --> 01:53:06.327]  Was there an entity that could control the monarchies of Europe?
[01:53:06.787 --> 01:53:08.147]  Did that entity exist?
[01:53:08.447 --> 01:53:11.068]  Did, you know, control things and events in Asia?
[01:53:11.368 --> 01:53:12.789]  Well, yes, I found that entity.
[01:53:12.829 --> 01:53:23.952]  That entity, I thought I'd found it anyway, and it was up, you know, I found out about the Council on Foreign Relations, the Royal Society for International Affairs, the Roundtable Group, how they were linked to the Rothschild money that goes back to 1773.
[01:53:25.772 --> 01:53:27.395]  And I thought, well boy, there it is right there.
[01:53:27.795 --> 01:53:35.405]  And I let my wife's cousin read the book, who had over 30 years in the CIA, and he said, you know, he said, you hit everything on this book right here.
[01:53:35.425 --> 01:53:36.246]  It's got everything in it.
[01:53:36.306 --> 01:53:38.109]  This is the way that you left out a few things.
[01:53:38.209 --> 01:53:38.930]  And I said, like what?
[01:53:39.628 --> 01:53:46.490]  He says, well, on the Kennedy thing, you know, yeah, he was going to shut down the Federal Reserve, but he was also going to do something else.
[01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:47.150]  And I said, what's that?
[01:53:47.170 --> 01:54:02.255]  And he said, he was pulling this out of Southeast Asia, which included Laos and Cambodia and the Golden Triangle, which means that we were not going to have black funding for the CIA that goes back all the way to OSS Team 101 during World War II when they seized Indochina away from the Japanese.
[01:54:02.715 --> 01:54:06.156]  And after they kicked the French out, which we helped them do, helped the Vietnam do,
[01:54:07.436 --> 01:54:10.181]  Then we ended up with a heroin trade.
[01:54:10.201 --> 01:54:14.710]  He said, we're talking billions of dollars of black funding that no one can account for.
[01:54:15.190 --> 01:54:16.914]  He said, and Kennedy was going to pull us out of that.
[01:54:17.014 --> 01:54:19.458]  So, you know, then Allen Dulles, you know, put a stop to that.
[01:54:19.538 --> 01:54:20.340]  Well, anyway.
[01:54:21.255 --> 01:54:22.155]  I thought, OK, fine.
[01:54:22.616 --> 01:54:23.456]  But where are you going with this?
[01:54:23.496 --> 01:54:25.397]  He said, well, he said, you have to understand.
[01:54:25.737 --> 01:54:31.099]  He said, I've read all of this stuff that these people have written about the Committee of 300 and all this sort of thing.
[01:54:31.159 --> 01:54:37.661]  And he said the Council of 30, or the Committee of 33, he says, but there's one at the very top that's called the Council of 13.
[01:54:38.141 --> 01:54:40.562]  And the Council of 13 controls the banks.
[01:54:40.902 --> 01:54:44.064]  They control all leaders of all countries.
[01:54:44.424 --> 01:54:46.585]  They control the communication systems.
[01:54:46.625 --> 01:54:48.365]  They control shipping.
[01:54:48.405 --> 01:54:50.206]  They control education.
[01:54:51.046 --> 01:54:55.149]  Medicine, media, the whole bit.
[01:54:55.949 --> 01:55:00.472]  And he said, you have to understand that the members change all the time.
[01:55:00.492 --> 01:55:05.255]  He said one time he was pretty sure that Henry Kissinger sat on that council and named a few others that I didn't know.
[01:55:05.976 --> 01:55:08.037]  But that's where it starts.
[01:55:08.097 --> 01:55:14.161]  And these people have one goal in mind, and that is a one world government, a one world currency, and they're in charge.
[01:55:14.521 --> 01:55:15.862]  It's just that simple.
[01:55:16.222 --> 01:55:17.683]  And it doesn't have to do with money.
[01:55:18.043 --> 01:55:19.504]  It has to do with power.
[01:55:20.234 --> 01:55:27.097]  It has to do with elitists saying, we're the boss, you're the workers, you do what we say, and we'll feed you and house you and take care of you.
[01:55:27.377 --> 01:55:30.779]  And by the way, off the record, you've told me the name of this guy and I looked him up.
[01:55:31.099 --> 01:55:38.022]  He was big, high-powered oil, high-level CIA that's in your family, we're not going to say who, that told you this.
[01:55:38.582 --> 01:55:41.163]  Yeah, in fact he was over here the day before yesterday as a matter of fact.
[01:55:41.203 --> 01:55:42.544]  He's 86 now.
[01:55:44.099 --> 01:55:50.801]  And he was down working in Chile, Peru, Uruguay, was part of the Cuban operations and all of that.
[01:55:52.602 --> 01:55:54.423]  Is he happy about what's happening?
[01:55:54.803 --> 01:55:55.683]  Oh, absolutely not.
[01:55:55.743 --> 01:55:58.324]  He's a super patriot, always has been, and all his friends were.
[01:55:58.844 --> 01:56:04.987]  He said that he was good friends with Colby, and Colby was a patriot when Colby was head of the CIA.
[01:56:05.047 --> 01:56:05.947]  He named a lot of people.
[01:56:05.967 --> 01:56:08.588]  He said, these guys, you know, they really tried to fight for this country.
[01:56:08.608 --> 01:56:09.868]  And they killed Colby, didn't they?
[01:56:10.829 --> 01:56:11.469]  Well, somebody did.
[01:56:12.190 --> 01:56:16.912]  Yeah, he was, that was set up to look as a stupid suicide and it was so obviously a homicide it was ridiculous.
[01:56:17.592 --> 01:56:19.953]  Or an accident, I guess it was a canoe accident or whatever it's supposed to be.
[01:56:19.973 --> 01:56:20.834]  Yeah, kayak.
[01:56:21.294 --> 01:56:28.057]  Yeah, well he said, he went to the funeral and he said that, he said no, he said somebody took him out.
[01:56:28.077 --> 01:56:30.258]  He was going to expose something that he wasn't sure what.
[01:56:32.736 --> 01:56:33.117]  Stay there.
[01:56:33.157 --> 01:56:33.657]  Let's come back.
[01:56:33.737 --> 01:56:34.638]  Long segment coming up.
[01:56:34.938 --> 01:56:37.540]  Let's get into world government being only the beginning.
[01:56:38.721 --> 01:56:40.502]  What's the endgame of world government?
[01:56:40.762 --> 01:56:42.083]  What are they going to do once they have it?
[01:56:42.584 --> 01:56:46.227]  And I want all the police and all the military and all the government people to listen.
[01:56:46.767 --> 01:56:48.889]  Everything we've talked about has come true so far.
[01:56:49.229 --> 01:56:51.671]  We're going directly to their own documents and statements.
[01:56:52.491 --> 01:56:53.532]  You need to understand.
[01:56:53.572 --> 01:56:58.176]  And as for the Committee of 13, that roundtable, I'll tell you about that.
[01:56:59.824 --> 01:57:06.668]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:57:06.808 --> 01:57:08.769]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[01:57:11.130 --> 01:57:12.651]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:58:59.406 --> 01:59:04.573]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:59:04.713 --> 01:59:09.079]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:59:09.239 --> 01:59:11.102]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:59:11.522 --> 01:59:12.884]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:59:13.144 --> 01:59:14.186]  There is a solution.

[02:00:01.807 --> 02:00:07.829]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:00:08.429 --> 02:00:11.430]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.052 --> 02:00:24.677]  Colonel Craig Roberts is our guest, and you can visit his website at RifleWarrior.com.
[02:00:25.518 --> 02:00:33.002]  He's had a whole bunch of best-selling books, but he's basically out of the publishing business these days, and he said that when these books are sold out, that may be it.
[02:00:33.442 --> 02:00:36.244]  So be sure and check out all the great books at RifleWarrior.com.
[02:00:36.264 --> 02:00:41.267]  We still sell a few of them at InfoWars.com as well in the online video bookstore shopping cart.
[02:00:41.327 --> 02:00:41.948]  Great material.
[02:00:43.050 --> 02:00:45.401]  But before we go any further, you were bringing up Committee of 13.
[02:00:47.046 --> 02:00:49.448]  And they call those steering groups.
[02:00:50.069 --> 02:00:52.531]  You've got the Bilderberg Group, 125 members.
[02:00:52.551 --> 02:00:55.074]  You've got the Trilateral Commission, with a couple hundred.
[02:00:55.094 --> 02:00:57.316]  You've got the CFR, a lower-level group of 4,000.
[02:00:58.617 --> 02:01:08.846]  But if you look at who's the head of the Club of Rome, or the head of the UN, or the head of the European Union, or the head of the Council on Foreign Relations, it's less than 20 people.
[02:01:09.487 --> 02:01:12.249]  It's less than 20 people that chair all those groups.
[02:01:13.174 --> 02:01:19.999]  And then routinely, we will see multiple members of those groups meeting for what they call steering committees.
[02:01:20.739 --> 02:01:29.405]  And every once in a while, you'll even see a blurb like, oh, the Library of Congress was locked down for two days, while the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group was meeting in secret.
[02:01:29.665 --> 02:01:32.067]  So they just kind of throw it out there to acclimate people.
[02:01:32.967 --> 02:01:35.328]  And we were getting into, they want world government.
[02:01:35.368 --> 02:01:48.735]  Now, Colonel, why do you think they've now gone from denying they're building world government to Von Rumpy, the head of the European Union, Ban Ki-moon, the head of the UN, the Secretary General, Al Gore, hundreds of these leaders,
[02:01:49.295 --> 02:02:02.920]  And the last six months have announced, world government's here, we're killing the dollar, we're going to tax everything you do, we're going to federalize your local neighborhood, we're going to take over your farms and ranches, we're going to brainwash your kids, we're going to fund the world government with carbon taxes.
[02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:05.061]  They are just flaunting it in our face.
[02:02:05.848 --> 02:02:08.750]  Well, that's because they have the power now.
[02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:12.071]  They think they've got the power to where no one can stop it.
[02:02:12.111 --> 02:02:13.132]  They've gone over the hump.
[02:02:13.172 --> 02:02:15.513]  They've come out into the open from the shadows.
[02:02:16.394 --> 02:02:21.076]  And now what they're trying to do is rally support globally from anybody they can.
[02:02:21.116 --> 02:02:23.317]  And they sugarcoat everything.
[02:02:23.358 --> 02:02:24.258]  And they say, it's for your own good.
[02:02:24.258 --> 02:02:24.738]  We're doing our own good.
[02:02:24.758 --> 02:02:25.738]  This is what we're trying to do.
[02:02:25.778 --> 02:02:26.939]  We're trying to protect the ocean.
[02:02:26.979 --> 02:02:28.059]  We're trying to protect the air.
[02:02:28.099 --> 02:02:29.540]  We're trying to protect the climate.
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:30.880]  We're trying to protect the children.
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:32.680]  We're trying to protect your health.
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:34.741]  We're trying to make sure everybody has health insurance.
[02:02:35.341 --> 02:02:36.181]  And they just go on and on.
[02:02:36.221 --> 02:02:37.702]  Everybody's going, yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:02:38.142 --> 02:02:39.762]  I'll sit back and you can take care of me.
[02:02:41.323 --> 02:02:48.625]  Which kills, absolutely destroys the original American spirit of you just give me a chance and I'll take care of myself.
[02:02:49.455 --> 02:02:50.736]  And I'll take care of my family.
[02:02:50.756 --> 02:02:54.180]  That was the pioneer spirit that built this nation above all the others.
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.803]  And now that's being taken, the rug's being jerked out.
[02:02:57.083 --> 02:02:58.224]  Progress is being bought.
[02:02:58.304 --> 02:03:00.286]  We're being bought and sold at the same time.
[02:03:00.646 --> 02:03:01.607]  We're turned into chattel.
[02:03:01.828 --> 02:03:02.428]  We're slaves.
[02:03:03.269 --> 02:03:07.894]  You know, when they started the income tax, it was a step toward national slavery.
[02:03:08.334 --> 02:03:14.036]  And when we get a global tax, it'll be international slavery, because if you don't pay your tax, you go to jail.
[02:03:14.056 --> 02:03:18.537]  If you don't pay your tax, they seize your house, they seize your assets, your bank account, and so on down the line.
[02:03:18.557 --> 02:03:20.618]  So you've got to pay the tax, so that means you've got to go to work.
[02:03:20.658 --> 02:03:31.882]  Well, here's the job we're going to give you, because this is what we say you can do, and here's how much we're going to pay you, and we're going to make sure that you spend so much time working that you don't have any time to plot against us.
[02:03:32.382 --> 02:03:32.783]  I think so.
[02:03:52.628 --> 02:04:10.335]  Have you noticed, and a lot of you have, I know I have, have you noticed that when you put on CBS News in the evening, and they have a news story, and you switch to NBC, they have the same news story at the same time, and you go to ABC, they have the same news story at the same time.
[02:04:10.675 --> 02:04:12.336]  They have the commercial breaks at the same time.
[02:04:12.356 --> 02:04:16.137]  When they come back, it's a different news story, but they all do the same news story.
[02:04:16.578 --> 02:04:22.240]  Somebody orchestrates all three branches of the media, as far as
[02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:27.083]  You know, what we're allowed to see and hear, what stories are stories and what stories aren't stories.
[02:04:27.103 --> 02:04:41.072]  We have stuff that comes up like this, these hackers that got into the computer systems and found out that the global warming thing was this giant hoax, and not one major media out there, government controlled media, reported or even breathed a word of it.
[02:04:41.472 --> 02:04:43.994]  You've got people out there who've been trying to say,
[02:04:45.197 --> 02:04:46.839]  Just show us Obama's birth certificate.
[02:04:47.239 --> 02:04:47.980]  Just show it to us.
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:53.105]  Well, years ago, the media would have jumped all over that, you know, like a crow on a piece of corn.
[02:04:53.526 --> 02:04:56.309]  And now, they won't even touch it, they won't even mention it.
[02:04:56.369 --> 02:05:00.013]  In fact, if you even mention it, then you're a birther.
[02:05:00.293 --> 02:05:01.214]  You're a weirdo.
[02:05:01.234 --> 02:05:02.535]  You wear tinfoil hats.
[02:05:02.755 --> 02:05:03.977]  And so, what they've done,
[02:05:04.657 --> 02:05:18.381]  Is they've taken and decided what you're going to see and what you're going to hear, and it goes back to the original 1773 Rothschild plan that I've got a whole chapter on in my book, Killzone, that says, control all outlets of public information.
[02:05:18.801 --> 02:05:20.781]  That's one of the main tenets you have to do.
[02:05:21.501 --> 02:05:27.143]  And then you can use the media for mind control, because you tell everybody what's good, what's bad, and they believe it.
[02:05:27.683 --> 02:05:30.924]  And, of course, obviously everybody doesn't believe it, but I mean,
[02:05:33.725 --> 02:05:35.367]  What is the endgame though?
[02:05:35.407 --> 02:05:36.988]  They openly want world government.
[02:05:37.568 --> 02:05:42.352]  From your research, what are they planning to do once they have the world government?
[02:05:42.932 --> 02:05:45.894]  Well, once they get world government, it's going to be very temporary.
[02:05:46.875 --> 02:05:49.437]  There's no way they're going to be able to keep it.
[02:05:49.657 --> 02:05:55.421]  And the reason they're not going to be able to keep it is they're going to be breaking too many natural laws of nature.
[02:05:58.348 --> 02:06:02.571]  People, the human race, typically goes back to tribalism.
[02:06:03.192 --> 02:06:07.255]  Small communities, small groups, you know, small countries.
[02:06:07.535 --> 02:06:10.017]  And each one of them pretty much sticks to themselves.
[02:06:10.798 --> 02:06:15.522]  They may trade back and forth, they may invade each other once in a while, but pretty much their home is their home.
[02:06:15.562 --> 02:06:18.644]  The Spartans never got along with the Athenians until the Persians invaded.
[02:06:21.279 --> 02:06:23.441]  Uh, and that was a very small country in Greece, you know?
[02:06:24.002 --> 02:06:26.043]  Uh, they're not going to be able to blend everybody.
[02:06:26.083 --> 02:06:32.008]  They're trying real hard, but the more they do it, it's trying to mix oil and water, and it just isn't going to happen.
[02:06:32.068 --> 02:06:34.971]  As soon as you stop stirring the pot, the oil separates from the water.
[02:06:35.311 --> 02:06:36.572]  It's that way with people, too.
[02:06:36.912 --> 02:06:38.273]  They're not going to be able to maintain it.
[02:06:38.313 --> 02:06:41.196]  The problem is, there's going to be a certain amount of time
[02:06:41.796 --> 02:06:42.217]  We're good to go.
[02:07:05.572 --> 02:07:05.892]  I think?
[02:07:24.224 --> 02:07:27.687]  And that's what Maurice Strong publicly said at the UN in 92.
[02:07:27.727 --> 02:07:29.589]  That's what the UN documents say.
[02:07:29.609 --> 02:07:33.872]  That's what the new internal UN documents that just got released say.
[02:07:34.292 --> 02:07:40.558]  They, for environmental reasons, want world government to carry out or orderly population reduction.
[02:07:40.818 --> 02:07:42.639]  Now you brought that up to me during the break.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:49.205]  Give us your take, your research, on what they're planning once they have their world government in place with population reduction.
[02:07:49.747 --> 02:07:53.973]  Well, even before they get world government in place, they'll start population reduction.
[02:07:55.475 --> 02:08:01.242]  You know, you can look at the Bible, you can look at the Book of Revelation, the rider of the pale horse is pestilence and disease.
[02:08:01.262 --> 02:08:03.725]  H1N1, flu, for one thing.
[02:08:07.828 --> 02:08:17.871]  It's not that big of a deal, but the media is making it a huge deal, and it's not anywhere near as bad as some of the other things we've got going on in the disease area.
[02:08:18.931 --> 02:08:20.231]  But what are they doing?
[02:08:20.251 --> 02:08:23.452]  They're using the media to scare everybody to go in and get vaccinated.
[02:08:24.232 --> 02:08:33.575]  And if we go back to my youth, we were all forced when I was in the fourth grade to march over to the auditorium and get the polio vaccine.
[02:08:34.264 --> 02:08:35.845]  I didn't even know what we were going over there for.
[02:08:35.865 --> 02:08:37.546]  The next thing I knew, they were sticking me with needles.
[02:08:38.366 --> 02:08:41.348]  Every kid my age got the Salk Polio Vaccine.
[02:08:41.688 --> 02:08:48.112]  And it wasn't until later that they found out that all of that Salk Polio Vaccine had been contaminated with the Green Monkey Virus.
[02:08:48.612 --> 02:08:49.232]  So, you know...
[02:08:51.339 --> 02:09:02.767]  The problem with that is you can make links, if you do a lot of research and talk to the right doctors, you can make links between the small polio vaccine that we received and the cancer outbreaks from age 40 on of my generation.
[02:09:02.887 --> 02:09:03.808]  No, that's confirmed.
[02:09:04.508 --> 02:09:16.677]  We have the internal Food and Drug Administration reports where they talk about over 100 million Americans, that was by the 70s, had gotten these very rare but very deadly cancers from the SV40
[02:09:18.698 --> 02:09:21.582]  Simeon virus 40, which is a deadly cancer virus.
[02:09:22.043 --> 02:09:26.208]  Yeah, and I ended up with colon cancer and almost died from that, or did die from that back in 97.
[02:09:26.249 --> 02:09:29.453]  That's right, you came back though.
[02:09:29.873 --> 02:09:33.759]  All of my friends have had one form of cancer or another that are my age.
[02:09:34.779 --> 02:09:37.340]  And we didn't have that, you know, in 1880.
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:39.680]  We didn't have it in 1920.
[02:09:40.081 --> 02:09:42.801]  We had it after the 50s, after everybody was vaccinated.
[02:09:42.821 --> 02:09:45.442]  So now we're looking at the H1N1 vaccine.
[02:09:46.142 --> 02:09:47.483]  And who's to say what's really in it?
[02:09:47.803 --> 02:09:48.943]  I mean, go back to the Gulf War.
[02:09:48.983 --> 02:09:51.104]  All those guys took shots for nerve gas.
[02:09:51.564 --> 02:09:53.925]  I don't even know how you can come up with a shot for nerve gas.
[02:09:53.945 --> 02:09:58.466]  The only thing you've got for nerve gas is an atropine injection after you get the nerve gas.
[02:09:58.946 --> 02:10:02.348]  There was squalene and anthrax is what the army and meds did a lot of it.
[02:10:22.884 --> 02:10:28.185]  Well, whatever it was, the human body has a great immune system, if you give it a chance.
[02:10:28.585 --> 02:10:32.806]  But we pump ourselves full of so much garbage that the immune system doesn't know what to do.
[02:10:33.226 --> 02:10:43.009]  And then when you read John P. Holdren's book, Ecoscience, White House Science Czar, he says, we're going to put stuff in your water supply and vaccines to sterilize and kill your butt better than a hammer.
[02:10:43.309 --> 02:10:46.550]  I mean, these guys can write government policy books bragging what they're doing.
[02:10:46.990 --> 02:10:48.210]  Well, go back to fluoride.
[02:10:48.925 --> 02:10:59.932]  You know, we had DDT, we didn't have a problem with mosquitos and all these other critters, but then we go to fluoride, they start putting fluoride in the water, it's supposed to be good for your teeth, but look at all the stuff that fluoride does.
[02:11:00.532 --> 02:11:05.615]  It's just, and they still do it, and still give us fluoride treatments.
[02:11:05.715 --> 02:11:18.443]  There's so much going on that eventually reduces the population, but the big thing is, if they get into, here's the point I was going to make, is let's say this global government takes over,
[02:11:19.131 --> 02:11:22.533]  And there is rebellions that occur in different countries.
[02:11:22.553 --> 02:11:28.457]  The United States has a bunch of people that stand up against them and so does Canada and the UK and Germany and whatever.
[02:11:29.158 --> 02:11:36.543]  They don't care because they don't mind killing as many of us as they have to because that also is population reduction.
[02:11:38.464 --> 02:11:42.167]  And Henry Kissinger's State Department of Random 200 states that.
[02:11:42.187 --> 02:11:43.308]  They said, we'll use famine?
[02:11:44.093 --> 02:11:45.095]  We'll use war.
[02:11:46.196 --> 02:11:51.564]  We'll use population reduction to carry this out.
[02:11:52.606 --> 02:11:54.468]  And the public better grow up and face this.
[02:11:54.528 --> 02:11:59.356]  Calls are coming up at the bottom of the hour, but when we come back, I've got some other key questions for Colonel Craig Roberts.

[02:13:01.357 --> 02:13:05.040]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:13:05.361 --> 02:13:08.383]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:13:08.624 --> 02:13:10.045]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:13:10.723 --> 02:13:13.384]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:13:13.404 --> 02:13:19.626]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:13:19.786 --> 02:13:25.308]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:13:25.328 --> 02:13:28.129]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:13:28.249 --> 02:13:34.971]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:13:35.071 --> 02:13:37.192]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:13:37.432 --> 02:13:38.752]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:13:39.012 --> 02:13:41.293]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:13:41.473 --> 02:13:43.333]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:13:43.613 --> 02:13:48.415]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:13:48.735 --> 02:13:53.536]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:14:00.026 --> 02:14:00.467]  Gold.
[02:14:00.827 --> 02:14:02.108]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:14:02.348 --> 02:14:08.454]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:14:08.635 --> 02:14:12.458]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:14:12.699 --> 02:14:14.601]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:14:14.661 --> 02:14:16.943]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:14:17.083 --> 02:14:23.970]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and

[02:14:56.278 --> 02:15:06.287]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:15:06.427 --> 02:15:07.668]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:15:07.688 --> 02:15:08.389]  It's very real.
[02:15:08.509 --> 02:15:12.272]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:15:12.412 --> 02:15:16.756]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:15:30.254 --> 02:15:32.978]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[02:15:33.078 --> 02:15:35.682]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[02:15:35.862 --> 02:15:36.202]  I think so.
[02:16:05.748 --> 02:16:07.989]  His website's RifleWarrior.com.
[02:16:08.009 --> 02:16:09.209]  That's RifleWarrior.com.
[02:16:09.389 --> 02:16:10.170]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:16:10.230 --> 02:16:14.091]  Our websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[02:16:17.672 --> 02:16:19.193]  It's hard having my job.
[02:16:20.754 --> 02:16:26.736]  And knowing that we've bought over a hundred government policy books and documents directly
[02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:49.822]  You know, from government organizations and university publishers, where they said 40 years ago, we're going to get all the American people on psychotropic drugs, we're going to break up the family, we're going to train the kids to tattle on everybody, we're going to use phony environmentalism to take everybody's resources, we're going to raise the taxes until everybody goes bankrupt and is dependent on government.
[02:16:50.595 --> 02:17:03.153]  And then to now see it all happening, and to know these are horrible, wicked, murderous criminals, and we're making some headway but not fast enough, and I just want to bring these criminals to justice.
[02:17:04.775 --> 02:17:06.278]  Craig Roberts, I mean, how do you deal with this?
[02:17:08.652 --> 02:17:13.557]  Long time ago, when I was doing lectures across the country, I'd say, look, you know, I love the government.
[02:17:14.038 --> 02:17:20.605]  I just hate the criminals that are inside of it that use the power to corrupt everything that, you know, in violation of the Constitution and the laws.
[02:17:20.625 --> 02:17:21.946]  I mean, they run, they're rogue.
[02:17:21.986 --> 02:17:22.627]  They run rampant.
[02:17:22.647 --> 02:17:23.708]  They do whatever they want to do.
[02:17:24.229 --> 02:17:28.233]  But yet, if you break the law, they come down with all of the king's horses and all of the king's men.
[02:17:29.234 --> 02:17:35.200]  We have got to educate ourselves and everybody we know that the U.S.
[02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:37.962]  government is the bottom government.
[02:17:38.002 --> 02:17:38.603]  Not the top.
[02:17:38.643 --> 02:17:39.424]  They're not the leaders.
[02:17:39.444 --> 02:17:42.226]  Those representatives we send to Washington are not our political leaders.
[02:17:42.246 --> 02:17:43.267]  They're our representatives.
[02:17:43.427 --> 02:17:44.148]  We're the leaders.
[02:17:44.228 --> 02:17:44.949]  We're the bosses.
[02:17:46.495 --> 02:17:48.636]  The federal government is the very bottom government.
[02:17:48.656 --> 02:17:56.322]  It's supposed to be a homeowner's association in the District of Columbia where the states meet to resolve issues and to look out for the common good.
[02:17:56.342 --> 02:17:58.003]  That's all it's supposed to be for.
[02:17:58.363 --> 02:18:03.687]  The 10th Amendment specifically says if it's not in this Constitution, you can't do it, guys.
[02:18:04.507 --> 02:18:07.928]  You politicians, you have to go by what's in the Constitution.
[02:18:07.948 --> 02:18:09.609]  They violate it every single day.
[02:18:10.049 --> 02:18:20.873]  When I had to go testify before Congress in 1995, I spent some time visiting with some of the Senators and Congressmen up there, and I said, do you ever do a litmus test on the laws you pass?
[02:18:20.933 --> 02:18:22.074]  He said, what do you mean?
[02:18:22.154 --> 02:18:24.715]  I said, do you compare it to what the 10th Amendment says?
[02:18:25.335 --> 02:18:30.437]  Is that law legal for you to even come up with on a national level?
[02:18:32.453 --> 02:18:34.394]  Or is it in violation of the Constitution?
[02:18:35.034 --> 02:18:42.498]  The Tenth Amendment says if it's not covered in one of the aspects of the Constitution, that law is null and void upon inception.
[02:18:43.098 --> 02:18:48.781]  And you guys are up here passing stuff in violation of the Constitution, which makes you criminals.
[02:18:49.502 --> 02:18:50.662]  It makes you traitors.
[02:18:50.682 --> 02:18:51.723]  You're guilty of treason.
[02:18:52.395 --> 02:18:55.316]  You know, and they just look at you like, what are you talking about?
[02:18:55.356 --> 02:18:56.636]  We're the bosses.
[02:18:56.937 --> 02:18:58.177]  Craig, I want to go back here.
[02:18:58.597 --> 02:19:10.201]  Tell people briefly the General Barry McCaffrey story, telling the young graduates in the military, the officers, that we're going to have to use foreign troops in America.
[02:19:10.663 --> 02:19:18.608]  This was at the CASQ class in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and my nephew, a young captain just back from Somalia, was going there.
[02:19:18.748 --> 02:19:24.031]  It's the class you take before you go to Command and General Staff College.
[02:19:24.671 --> 02:19:29.274]  When his class went through, the graduation speaker was General Barry McGaffrey.
[02:19:29.294 --> 02:19:35.898]  When it was over, Brian called me, and he said, hey, I taught the boy well ever since he was an Eagle Scout.
[02:19:35.918 --> 02:19:38.039]  He knew all about the CFR and all that sort of stuff.
[02:19:38.832 --> 02:19:47.938]  And he said, they had introduced this general, Barry McGaffrey, as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, so I started taking copious notes, he says, and let me tell you what he said.
[02:19:47.978 --> 02:20:08.070]  He said that with the build-down of the military, this was during the Clinton administration, he says, with the build-down, I hate that word, of the military, and the shape the military's in right now, if we get deployed on two or more fronts overseas, that's the key, this is 1994-95 right in there, two or more fronts overseas,
[02:20:08.962 --> 02:20:17.948]  Then, if we have a declared national emergency at home, we will be forced to rely upon foreign assets to patrol our streets.
[02:20:18.948 --> 02:20:19.789]  Foreign assets.
[02:20:19.809 --> 02:20:20.429]  That means U.N.
[02:20:20.449 --> 02:20:20.730]  troops.
[02:20:21.130 --> 02:20:24.512]  And that mirrors what Henry Kissinger said.
[02:20:24.652 --> 02:20:25.152]  Absolutely.
[02:20:25.192 --> 02:20:26.113]  I mean, this is the plan.
[02:20:26.153 --> 02:20:29.675]  That's why we're still funneling all this money into the U.N.
[02:20:30.276 --> 02:20:37.821]  is that we can pull in people from everywhere from Manchuria to Russia to China to Mongolia.
[02:20:37.861 --> 02:20:38.301]  Who knows?
[02:20:39.168 --> 02:20:40.950]  And divide the country up and give major power.
[02:20:40.970 --> 02:20:57.983]  You know, I heard earlier when the young man was talking about whether or not American troops would fire upon American citizens here on the home front, and my sources of the military at higher levels say that there's no way that's going to happen.
[02:20:58.303 --> 02:21:07.010]  Well, the word's out that, you know, these people tipping their hand in Washington right now has got the military pretty much jazzed up against them.
[02:21:07.822 --> 02:21:08.363]  And they know it.
[02:21:08.383 --> 02:21:09.023]  So what do they do?
[02:21:09.083 --> 02:21:11.405]  They send more troops to Afghanistan to get them out of the country.
[02:21:12.386 --> 02:21:14.768]  If they start using foreign troops, it's not going to be a problem.
[02:21:14.788 --> 02:21:15.629]  It's not going to be an issue.
[02:21:15.649 --> 02:21:17.791]  They'll fire on whoever they're told to.
[02:21:17.871 --> 02:21:18.632]  Now here's the thing.
[02:21:18.672 --> 02:21:26.739]  I talked to, several years ago, I talked to Marina Porter, who previous to that was Marina Oswald.
[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:27.340]  Stay there.
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:28.921]  We're going to come back, finish this story.
[02:21:29.682 --> 02:21:40.064]  And then because it's so important for people to hear, briefly tell your story about when you died and came back to life on the operating table, then we're going to take some final phone calls here with Colonel Craig Roberts.
[02:21:40.224 --> 02:21:41.685]  Always amazing to have him on with us.
[02:21:42.045 --> 02:21:43.725]  RifleWarrior.com is his site.
[02:21:44.045 --> 02:21:47.146]  Our sites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:21:50.206 --> 02:21:51.087]  We're on the march.
[02:21:51.587 --> 02:21:53.187]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:21:54.107 --> 02:21:56.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:59.605 --> 02:22:08.710]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:11.892]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[02:22:12.112 --> 02:22:17.815]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[02:22:17.995 --> 02:22:22.477]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[02:22:22.758 --> 02:22:25.119]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[02:22:25.379 --> 02:22:34.464]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[02:22:34.584 --> 02:22:39.987]  He also recommends ZeoLife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[02:22:59.545 --> 02:23:02.469]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:23:02.929 --> 02:23:06.113]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:23:06.554 --> 02:23:10.919]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:23:11.139 --> 02:23:16.746]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:23:17.006 --> 02:23:21.510]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:23:21.791 --> 02:23:24.834]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:23:25.414 --> 02:23:29.818]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:23:30.219 --> 02:23:36.545]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:23:36.785 --> 02:23:38.747]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:23:39.227 --> 02:23:42.048]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:24:00.148 --> 02:24:02.750]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:24:03.151 --> 02:24:08.115]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:24:08.495 --> 02:24:10.217]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:24:10.537 --> 02:24:15.362]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:24:15.542 --> 02:24:16.503]  How much do you want?
[02:24:16.723 --> 02:24:17.464]  When do you want it?
[02:24:17.844 --> 02:24:19.445]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:24:19.726 --> 02:24:20.546]  When will you need it?
[02:24:20.807 --> 02:24:22.868]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:24:23.008 --> 02:24:24.109]  Will there be any food?
[02:24:24.350 --> 02:24:25.651]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:24:25.851 --> 02:24:30.934]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:24:31.114 --> 02:24:34.316]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:24:34.717 --> 02:24:38.199]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:24:38.519 --> 02:24:39.520]  How much will you need?
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:40.360]  We don't know.
[02:24:40.660 --> 02:24:41.561]  How much do you want?
[02:24:41.761 --> 02:24:42.481]  All you can get.
[02:24:42.501 --> 02:24:43.382]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:24:43.782 --> 02:24:46.543]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:24:46.823 --> 02:24:49.924]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:24:49.944 --> 02:24:51.104]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:24:51.144 --> 02:24:55.025]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:25:17.366 --> 02:25:19.387]  Colonel Craig Roberts is our guest.
[02:25:19.547 --> 02:25:27.770]  Jason Bernes is going to be sitting in tomorrow with Katherine Austin Fitz is on live and a bunch of other amazing guests on ClimateGate.
[02:25:29.851 --> 02:25:31.812]  I got a big interview I'm doing tomorrow in Dallas.
[02:25:31.832 --> 02:25:33.052]  We'll be airing that later in the week.
[02:25:33.092 --> 02:25:34.893]  So I'm traveling to Dallas just for this interview.
[02:25:36.631 --> 02:25:38.353]  Going back to Colonel Craig Roberts.
[02:25:38.373 --> 02:25:42.036]  Finishing up your Barry McCaffrey story, go ahead.
[02:25:42.637 --> 02:25:56.108]  Well, when my nephew called, he said that with McCaffrey being a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, he knew that he would probably be a globalist, and so he started taking these notes and he told that story.
[02:25:59.938 --> 02:26:03.041]  Uh, you know, uh, need troops on our, our soil.
[02:26:03.061 --> 02:26:04.903]  And ours, our guys are all committed overseas.
[02:26:04.943 --> 02:26:07.485]  We call on foreign assent, which meant for UN troops.
[02:26:07.525 --> 02:26:12.609]  Well, they wouldn't have a problem dealing with Americans that are armed and form a resistance.
[02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:23.099]  And when I talked to Marina Porter, uh, who was originally Marina Oswald, the Army Oswald's widow, uh, she said, you know, Mr. Roberts, she said in Russia,
[02:26:23.618 --> 02:26:31.163]  She said when they had to deal with the people, with the army, she said they would take the troops from the north and they would send them to the south.
[02:26:31.384 --> 02:26:34.166]  They would take the troops from the south and they would send them to the north.
[02:26:34.226 --> 02:26:39.730]  In other words, Ukrainians would go north and Russians would go to the Ukraine or Chechnya or something like that.
[02:26:40.050 --> 02:26:45.194]  And then, because of the culture difference, no one was related to anybody and they had no problems in shooting the people.
[02:26:45.874 --> 02:26:47.275]  So that's the same mentality.
[02:26:47.295 --> 02:26:49.537]  You take people from someplace else and you bring them here.
[02:26:50.616 --> 02:26:55.238]  It's going to be like sending us to Afghanistan or Iraq or Vietnam or Korea or whatever.
[02:26:55.278 --> 02:26:57.779]  We're shooting somebody else besides our own people.
[02:26:58.059 --> 02:27:01.400]  Well, meanwhile, they've got people here shooting our family.
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:04.501]  So that's the mentality of that type of an operation.
[02:27:04.521 --> 02:27:10.283]  Well, let me expand on that, though, because I know you're a police officer and SWAT team guy and police helicopter pilot.
[02:27:10.303 --> 02:27:11.483]  So you're deep into that culture.
[02:27:11.523 --> 02:27:16.625]  We've had long car rides together, you know, traveling to events where we've had discussions about this.
[02:27:17.205 --> 02:27:19.586]  And the average police officer is just a good guy.
[02:27:19.626 --> 02:27:20.587]  Their family's in it.
[02:27:21.047 --> 02:27:21.987]  They get out of the military.
[02:27:22.027 --> 02:27:23.048]  It's the job they take.
[02:27:23.888 --> 02:27:25.869]  But the commanders, the system.
[02:27:25.889 --> 02:27:27.330]  I mean, take our Austin police chief.
[02:27:27.690 --> 02:27:28.730]  He took a federal grant.
[02:27:28.830 --> 02:27:30.231]  They passed a law at the state level.
[02:27:30.491 --> 02:27:32.172]  They take blood without warrants now.
[02:27:32.212 --> 02:27:34.133]  They just announced no more warrants.
[02:27:34.853 --> 02:27:37.875]  I was at a lawyer's office signing some documents last night.
[02:27:38.215 --> 02:27:40.016]  The lawyer happened to be a former Travis County
[02:27:40.896 --> 02:27:41.296]  I don't
[02:27:57.449 --> 02:28:08.598]  Last year, at the SPP North American Union meeting, dressed up like Anarchists attacking other cops, people videotaped their boots and their staged arrest, the Royal Mountain Police admitted they staged it.
[02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:23.411]  Last year at the DNC in Denver, I was there, it was later confirmed, we had our suspicions but couldn't confirm it, but the police blew the whistle and said, yeah, they had other Denver police attack other police for the news cameras and didn't even tell the police
[02:28:23.891 --> 02:28:24.952]  That they were being attacked.
[02:28:25.072 --> 02:28:28.594]  Only the commander told them, stand down, let them throw bottles at you.
[02:28:29.114 --> 02:28:31.396]  That was declassified in Seattle in 99.
[02:28:31.936 --> 02:28:37.419]  And I sent my camera guys, Rob Dude, no criminal record, got arrested for filming police.
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:41.582]  They said no one in the city is allowed outside, day or night.
[02:28:42.162 --> 02:28:43.803]  A million people in the city of Pittsburgh.
[02:28:43.843 --> 02:28:44.964]  G20's coming to town.
[02:28:45.064 --> 02:28:47.526]  And we videotaped, and this is coming out in the new film.
[02:28:48.717 --> 02:29:07.111]  With sound cannons, the police and military driving around shooting people coming out of stores, old women with shopping bags would walk out during the day, nowhere near the convention center, cops would come up with billy clubs and say, get back, you're not allowed on the street, and the old woman goes, I just was shopping, the police dog bites her.
[02:29:07.791 --> 02:29:09.251]  Then, no one was resisting them.
[02:29:09.831 --> 02:29:14.412]  They're sound canoning and attacking nine-year-old kids in their front yards playing.
[02:29:14.652 --> 02:29:19.353]  People on their front porches, you know, it's old-fashioned in Pittsburgh, driving by, shooting them.
[02:29:19.693 --> 02:29:28.655]  Announcing, like out of a science fiction movie, that no right to redress, no right to assemble under this code.
[02:29:29.135 --> 02:29:32.055]  We played the video here many times, and they would fire it at them.
[02:29:32.555 --> 02:29:35.876]  Then, even though it was over Friday night, they went to the university.
[02:29:36.576 --> 02:29:39.598]  To the kids out at the park and said, you're not allowed to assemble.
[02:29:39.838 --> 02:29:42.559]  Like the police didn't just want martial law.
[02:29:43.079 --> 02:29:49.343]  They, and they brought them in from all over the country and the military and they, and then later the G20 met, they had private goons and police uniforms.
[02:29:49.363 --> 02:29:57.387]  Like you can pull up the video guys, snatching and grabbing, just go to YouTube and type in snatching, grab a secret arrest in Pittsburgh.
[02:29:57.727 --> 02:30:03.070]  And guys would just jump out of vehicles and grab people and drag them away, setting the precedent.
[02:30:03.651 --> 02:30:05.396]  And I don't have a hatred of police.
[02:30:05.476 --> 02:30:06.540]  I don't want to have a fight with them.
[02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:09.329]  I don't want to dislike their culture, but it's wrong.
[02:30:10.623 --> 02:30:15.046]  Women would be on bicycles at the university, and the police would say, off the streets, and they'd go, okay.
[02:30:15.306 --> 02:30:18.748]  They would chase them and billy club little women, like 90 pounds.
[02:30:19.089 --> 02:30:21.130]  And fundamentally, as a man, that makes me mad.
[02:30:21.470 --> 02:30:24.632]  Cops in Darth Vader outfits stomping and beating women.
[02:30:25.173 --> 02:30:28.015]  And then there'd be like 30 anarchists, as usual, paid.
[02:30:28.375 --> 02:30:32.278]  The cops would wait while they would, in front of the news, throw rocks.
[02:30:32.598 --> 02:30:36.941]  Then the anarchists would move to the back, and then the police would attack the peaceful people.
[02:30:37.021 --> 02:30:38.302]  It was all rigged, Craig!
[02:30:38.642 --> 02:30:38.962]  I mean, so...
[02:30:40.643 --> 02:30:54.828]  They don't even need foreign troops in many respects because so many police just, I mean, you've seen the footage probably from Miami where they said no protest allowed and they were shooting women in the face with rubber bullets and laughing about it later at the debriefing.
[02:30:55.248 --> 02:30:59.269]  I mean, they think of us as lower than, you know, shooting squirrels or something.
[02:30:59.309 --> 02:31:02.310]  I mean, you understand the culture and where it's gone.
[02:31:02.330 --> 02:31:08.292]  I don't, again, there are a lot of good police in the system, but what about the system itself?
[02:31:08.988 --> 02:31:14.653]  Well, you know, I can't speak for what happened to Becky's because that's a different breed of cat, but I know around here none of that would happen.
[02:31:16.195 --> 02:31:29.206]  I have lunch with a lot of our officers all the time in this area, and even though I'm retired, I'm not an outcast yet, and they basically say, if that ever comes here, you know, we're going home and putting on our fatigues.
[02:31:29.226 --> 02:31:34.131]  We're not going to be, you know, we're not going to be out, you know, doing, you know, all this global stuff like that.
[02:31:34.151 --> 02:31:35.392]  You know, we're going to the house.
[02:31:36.290 --> 02:31:37.471]  You know, I told them a story.
[02:31:37.511 --> 02:31:53.346]  I said, look, what happens someday, guys, when you get called to the station, everybody, the dispatcher comes on and tells all cars 10-19 the station, and you get there, and they take you into this assembly center, and they've got all these tables lined up, and they say, we want you to turn your guns in, and we want you to turn your handcuffs in.
[02:31:53.366 --> 02:31:57.590]  We're going to replace them with a new style something or other this afternoon.
[02:31:58.130 --> 02:32:03.515]  Meanwhile, go over to the cafeteria and get something to eat so we can do the paperwork, and you're going to draw new weapons when you come out.
[02:32:03.535 --> 02:32:04.996]  When you come out, there's no new weapons.
[02:32:05.396 --> 02:32:13.984]  Instead, you've been disarmed, and they hand you a nightstick or a can of mace and say, now go do your job with this, because we don't trust you as cops anymore, because you're not on our side.
[02:32:14.044 --> 02:32:15.565]  So we're going to disarm you as well.
[02:32:16.265 --> 02:32:18.307]  And, of course, everybody says, well, that's not going to happen here.
[02:32:18.728 --> 02:32:26.174]  Well, it's happened all over the world, and it can happen anyplace, as long as everybody blindly follows the idiots up there who are running the show.
[02:32:26.770 --> 02:32:37.015]  You know, our police chiefs around this country right now, a lot of them are being indoctrinated into this globalist mentality, into this very socialist, anti-Second Amendment mentality.
[02:32:37.055 --> 02:32:43.199]  We got a chief in Tulsa that came in, and when he first arrived, they hired him off.
[02:32:43.219 --> 02:32:46.860]  He was the first chief of police in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that was ever hired outside the department.
[02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:47.801]  He came from the East Coast.
[02:32:48.670 --> 02:32:54.653]  And, uh, when he came on board, someone, uh, the NRA sent him a complimentary free membership.
[02:32:55.213 --> 02:33:09.300]  And he walked into Internal Affairs, took that NRA membership with his, uh, with his, uh, aide-de-camp, uh, who's another idiot, and they shredded it and laughed and said, ah, what does the NRA think about this?
[02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:15.203]  And he shredded it like that, and everybody in Internal Affairs looked at him with a strange look, and he said, what's wrong?
[02:33:15.243 --> 02:33:16.984]  And he said, well, I'm the lieutenant there.
[02:33:17.737 --> 02:33:22.679]  I said, Chief, do you realize that 90% of the officers in the Tulsa Police Department are NRA members?
[02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:25.481]  And he just kind of just, well, I didn't know that.
[02:33:25.521 --> 02:33:26.281]  He kind of walked off.
[02:33:26.841 --> 02:33:29.742]  But that shows you the mentality of chiefs all across the country.
[02:33:30.103 --> 02:33:31.403]  Our hope lies in our sheriffs.
[02:33:31.903 --> 02:33:33.984]  Because our sheriffs don't get hired by mayors.
[02:33:34.024 --> 02:33:35.125]  They get elected.
[02:33:35.165 --> 02:33:39.547]  And if we can elect the right sheriff, the sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer of the county.
[02:33:40.217 --> 02:33:53.170]  And the sheriff is above the federal government, operations in the county, he's above the mayor, he's above all the chiefs of police, and that's the guy you need to get in and support, is a good, patriotic American sheriff.
[02:33:53.550 --> 02:34:00.718]  And if we can do that and keep that going, like Sheriff Mack and some of the others up there, Sheriff Craig and some of the others, and increase those,
[02:34:01.519 --> 02:34:04.142]  Those numbers that that's where we're starting to grasp.
[02:34:04.182 --> 02:34:12.513]  Well, well, I mean you brought up history and and what for those that don't know you obviously know this but in these control grids fascist or communist all command and control
[02:34:13.615 --> 02:34:17.558]  They first create special paramilitary units, like SWAT teams, which you've been a member of.
[02:34:18.138 --> 02:34:20.860]  And I'm not saying there isn't some use for those in bigger departments.
[02:34:20.900 --> 02:34:26.864]  The point is, then they expand those units, but then disarm the main units.
[02:34:27.084 --> 02:34:28.325]  England, in places, do this.
[02:34:29.186 --> 02:34:36.371]  And only allow the secretive Praetorian internal police to have the high-powered weapons, or the lethal weapons.
[02:34:37.331 --> 02:34:40.112]  And there is an agenda in this.
[02:34:40.492 --> 02:34:57.796]  I've noticed when the media likes to demonize local police for things they do wrong, but then the feds are always billed as the saviors who come in and federalize things and then make departments put in the chiefs they say, and then bring in the hate laws and turn the police into political officers that spy on everybody else.
[02:34:58.116 --> 02:35:00.397]  And that's now the conversion we're seeing.
[02:35:00.437 --> 02:35:01.517]  I mean, did that upset
[02:35:02.017 --> 02:35:02.317]  Well, yeah.
[02:35:02.337 --> 02:35:04.220]  I mean, everybody went ballistic around here.
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:06.022]  I mean, I don't think those morons that came out with that...
[02:35:17.234 --> 02:35:44.140]  Realized the blowback they would get from the local law enforcement communities across the nation, especially, you know, in this part of the country, the Midwest and the Southwest and some parts of the Northwest, where, you know, these guys are a lot of, you know, there's so many veterans who are now police officers, there's so many Christians who are police officers, there's NRA members who are police officers, there's, you know, every category they came up with, they're in law enforcement and they're in the military.
[02:35:44.850 --> 02:35:56.633]  And so when you start rubber stamping who the enemy of the government is, and you come up with something without thinking it through, and then it gets released where everybody sees it, you've got a major problem.
[02:35:56.653 --> 02:36:03.155]  Well, that's why we got it, was because police and even a federal marshal were upset by it, but what about...
[02:36:03.815 --> 02:36:09.680]  How they're now, and this was confirmed, people didn't believe it six months ago, now it's been in, you know, Washington Post, everywhere else.
[02:36:10.240 --> 02:36:19.728]  All the VFWs, even that had 150-year-old plugged cannons, spiked cannons, they had to register them all and then turn a lot of it in.
[02:36:20.048 --> 02:36:25.272]  The government said, oh, you know that rifle you've got, that we have a record of, that you had from World War I?
[02:36:25.593 --> 02:36:29.976]  You can't have that hanging above your VFW now, you gotta turn it into us.
[02:36:30.136 --> 02:36:32.038]  I mean, folks, this is serious.
[02:36:32.892 --> 02:36:34.152]  Well, we didn't have that happen here.
[02:36:34.172 --> 02:36:38.734]  I mean, these guys still got the Springfields and the M1s they march with, with the flags and all of that.
[02:36:38.774 --> 02:36:40.234]  And they're fully operational.
[02:36:40.254 --> 02:36:41.255]  They haven't plugged or anything.
[02:36:43.115 --> 02:36:44.416]  You know, they got them years and years ago.
[02:36:45.516 --> 02:36:48.377]  But what we are seeing is with the BATFE,
[02:36:49.382 --> 02:36:49.923]  You know, it gets me.
[02:36:49.943 --> 02:36:53.005]  It used to be the ATF, then it was the BATF, now it's the BATFP.
[02:36:53.025 --> 02:36:55.908]  They just get more alphabet, you know, all the time.
[02:36:57.589 --> 02:37:05.656]  They've got people there working as agents out there enforcing so-called gun control laws that don't know anything about firearms.
[02:37:05.996 --> 02:37:08.959]  And they couldn't tell you an automatic weapon from a semi-automatic weapon.
[02:37:09.059 --> 02:37:33.316]  Well let me say this, you've had run-ins with them and you've clearly evidenced that the BATF was involved in Oklahoma City at certain levels, but, and you can comment on that if you want to elaborate, but I want to take a few final calls here, but I've had a couple run-ins at gun shows and a few other times with the BATF, BATFE, whatever it is today, and these guys came off like
[02:37:34.196 --> 02:37:36.038]  Well, you know, I don't know.
[02:37:36.098 --> 02:37:43.543]  What I run into and have over the years is they'll have agents who try to go in and enforce laws in areas where they have minimal training.
[02:37:58.425 --> 02:38:07.517]  And it's like, well, in their own mind, in their own attitude is, gee, you have too many guns, or you have too much ammunition.
[02:38:07.818 --> 02:38:09.100]  You almost have an arsenal.
[02:38:09.300 --> 02:38:10.722]  You don't need all these guns.
[02:38:11.317 --> 02:38:15.540]  Well, there's nothing anywhere that limits the amount of guns or ammunition you can own.
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:16.200]  Exactly!
[02:38:16.340 --> 02:38:27.187]  Every month I see an article about some old vets cleaning his gun in his garage, the neighbor sees it, the BATF comes, and then they arrest him and say he had 45 guns, it was an arsenal.
[02:38:27.287 --> 02:38:27.627]  Well, what?
[02:38:27.707 --> 02:38:28.488]  It's not illegal!
[02:38:28.648 --> 02:38:29.508]  No, it's not illegal.
[02:38:29.748 --> 02:38:38.534]  There's a guy in California, who's a member of the .50 caliber association, who was arrested in the state of California because he had links
[02:38:39.700 --> 02:38:58.887]  Left over from some .50 caliber ammo belts he bought, he linked around so he could shoot them in his Barrett, out on the range, and the links were in a bucket or a coffee can or something, and they came in and arrested him because he had large capacity ammunition feeding device for machine gun links.
[02:38:59.625 --> 02:39:01.426]  You know, and you didn't have a machine gun.
[02:39:01.466 --> 02:39:03.247]  I mean, what are you going to feed with those things anyway?
[02:39:03.287 --> 02:39:04.388]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[02:39:04.788 --> 02:39:09.250]  It's that kind of mentality that pushes people over the edge and causes blowback.
[02:39:09.831 --> 02:39:23.198]  And, uh, you know, I mean, look... Well, what about people that'll have an AR-15, that's a legal AR-15, it misfires, they go and tattle on themselves, the police show up and they get charged like that veteran and go to prison.
[02:39:23.780 --> 02:39:24.160]  Oh, I know.
[02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:24.921]  I know.
[02:39:24.941 --> 02:39:32.244]  This is a total lack of common sense and flexibility in street officers and in federal agents that we're starting to see more and more of.
[02:39:32.304 --> 02:39:34.225]  We did not have this 20, 30 years ago.
[02:39:34.665 --> 02:39:35.946]  We had people with common sense.
[02:39:37.306 --> 02:39:42.169]  You know, I don't know how many people that I caught, you know, playing around with silencers and stuff, and they weren't really silencers.
[02:39:42.209 --> 02:39:47.851]  They'd take a lawnmower muffler or a pop bottle or something, and they'd put it on the end of a .22 to see what it sounded like.
[02:39:48.272 --> 02:39:52.974]  Well, yeah, that could be a federal offense, because once you put those two things together, you have a sound suppression.
[02:39:53.394 --> 02:39:55.676]  But everybody's done that at one time or another.
[02:39:55.736 --> 02:39:56.677]  They live on the farm.
[02:39:57.017 --> 02:39:58.298]  Oh yeah, everybody's done that.
[02:39:58.579 --> 02:39:59.700]  And you know, what's the big deal?
[02:39:59.740 --> 02:40:12.671]  But you can go out right now and you can buy a real sound suppressor with a threaded pistol barrel and the whole bit and register it for $200 and have it and carry it and do whatever you want to with it.
[02:40:12.911 --> 02:40:14.213]  But you can't build your own.
[02:40:14.853 --> 02:40:15.775]  It's a tax thing.
[02:40:16.135 --> 02:40:18.178]  And that's where they get used, the federal tax thing.
[02:40:18.579 --> 02:40:23.467]  But, you know, like you say, I know a guy that he called me up and he said, I got a problem with an SKS I bought.
[02:40:23.507 --> 02:40:24.208]  I said, what's that?
[02:40:24.308 --> 02:40:28.354]  He said, I squeezed the trigger and it emptied six rounds all of a sudden.
[02:40:28.514 --> 02:40:29.476]  It didn't sound like a machine gun.
[02:40:30.183 --> 02:40:32.224]  And I said, well, you better get a check.
[02:40:32.244 --> 02:40:32.644]  Well, he did.
[02:40:32.684 --> 02:40:40.628]  What happened was he left it out in the shed and it rusted some of the internal parts in the receiver, in the trigger mechanism.
[02:40:40.988 --> 02:40:41.528]  They cleaned it up.
[02:40:41.568 --> 02:40:42.068]  It was fine.
[02:40:42.428 --> 02:40:48.111]  But if somebody had heard that, you know, let's say some deputies driving down the road heard that, they would have arrested him for having a machine gun.
[02:40:48.611 --> 02:40:50.912]  Well, it's not a machine gun, but it just happened to be defective.
[02:40:52.864 --> 02:40:59.050]  Well, also there's this magical thing about a fully auto when my experience is I don't want a full auto.
[02:40:59.130 --> 02:41:05.576]  I want single shot or burst because you can more effectively put your lead where you want it.
[02:41:06.837 --> 02:41:12.943]  Well, you know, my background, you know what that is, I'm better with a bolt action deer rifle.
[02:41:13.553 --> 02:41:16.915]  You know, you give me a scope and a deer rifle and give me a hill, I'm good to go.
[02:41:17.656 --> 02:41:22.800]  Somebody out here is going to get some kind of an automatic weapon, only thing they're going to find out is they're going to run out of ammunition real soon.
[02:41:23.420 --> 02:41:24.741]  I mean, you know, what's the point?
[02:41:25.702 --> 02:41:28.003]  So everybody's got their own ideas on this stuff.
[02:41:29.545 --> 02:41:39.732]  But, you know, the bottom line is, I never saw such a resurgence of people buying weapons and ammunition.
[02:41:40.256 --> 02:41:45.000]  But isn't that a strong message of the New World Order that this country isn't going down without a fight?
[02:42:04.096 --> 02:42:06.378]  Yeah, I think so, and I think it shocked them.
[02:42:06.678 --> 02:42:11.181]  And you haven't seen any mention of any gun control laws, even from Schumer and Boxer and Feinstein.
[02:42:11.201 --> 02:42:13.402]  No, they've got them introduced, though, but they won't talk about them.
[02:42:13.462 --> 02:42:14.283]  They won't talk about it.
[02:42:14.323 --> 02:42:20.047]  They don't want to say anything, because they know it would cause a massive blowback.
[02:42:20.087 --> 02:42:22.909]  Now, remember what happened during the assault weapons ban.
[02:42:23.309 --> 02:42:24.550]  The Democrats lost Congress.
[02:42:24.610 --> 02:42:25.591]  Well, now this medical
[02:42:26.883 --> 02:42:30.065]  But I don't think they're going to let a group of patriots come in next year.
[02:42:30.085 --> 02:42:31.566]  I think they're going to stage terror attacks before then.
[02:42:42.622 --> 02:42:45.987]  Alright, we're going to take a few final calls on the other side quickly.
[02:42:46.808 --> 02:42:48.831]  I've kind of hogged the time with Colonel Roberts.
[02:42:48.871 --> 02:42:51.114]  Always great having him on covering a thousand different issues.
[02:42:51.515 --> 02:42:53.498]  We're going to take some of your calls in the final segment.
[02:42:53.518 --> 02:42:58.505]  Quick answers from Craig Roberts, RifleWarrior.com, OurSightsInfoWars.com.
[02:43:00.021 --> 02:43:05.004]  I have owned every light you can think of, and my Paclite is the one I refuse to leave home without.
[02:43:05.145 --> 02:43:06.906]  That's what Jerry from Oregon said.
[02:43:07.066 --> 02:43:08.387]  Your flashlights are the best.
[02:43:08.547 --> 02:43:14.411]  We bought some three years ago, and all three Paclites have gone through two hurricanes each, and they just keep going on and on.
[02:43:14.631 --> 02:43:17.693]  And that's what Albert in Florida said about the amazing Paclite.
[02:43:17.873 --> 02:43:25.198]  Paclite's multicolored calves come equipped with two high-powered LED lights, snap on to any 9-volt battery, and will last over 1,200 hours.
[02:43:25.418 --> 02:43:27.079]  Listen to what Jerry from Michigan said.
[02:43:27.299 --> 02:43:30.441]  After carrying a pack light in my pants pocket for two years, it was bound to happen.
[02:43:30.681 --> 02:43:32.322]  The pants and the light went through the wash together.
[02:43:32.562 --> 02:43:33.322]  And it still works!
[02:43:33.503 --> 02:43:38.545]  The pack light has a 25 year warranty, starts at just $12.99, and is an excellent gift idea.

[02:44:01.138 --> 02:44:04.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:08.162]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:44:08.402 --> 02:44:09.803]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:44:10.518 --> 02:44:13.179]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:44:13.199 --> 02:44:19.420]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:44:19.580 --> 02:44:25.102]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:44:25.122 --> 02:44:34.764]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:44:34.864 --> 02:44:35.525]  Tim Geithner?
[02:44:35.725 --> 02:44:36.185]  Bernanke?
[02:44:36.225 --> 02:44:36.986]  They're arsonists!
[02:44:37.226 --> 02:44:38.548]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:44:38.808 --> 02:44:41.090]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:44:41.270 --> 02:44:43.112]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:44:43.132 --> 02:44:48.177]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:44:48.537 --> 02:44:53.342]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:45:06.149 --> 02:45:17.178]  Aerial spraying, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[02:45:17.898 --> 02:45:20.440]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[02:45:21.001 --> 02:45:26.425]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[02:45:30.669 --> 02:45:34.910]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[02:45:35.390 --> 02:45:38.611]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[02:45:39.271 --> 02:45:42.611]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[02:45:43.172 --> 02:45:47.833]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[02:45:48.333 --> 02:45:51.493]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today.
[02:46:01.585 --> 02:46:16.853]  Alright, I meant to go to more of your calls, but I've been out of control today talking to Colonel Greg Roberts.
[02:46:16.913 --> 02:46:18.253]  Big show tomorrow, by the way.
[02:46:18.753 --> 02:46:19.834]  Ron in Canada.
[02:46:19.854 --> 02:46:21.435]  You're on the air with Colonel Greg Roberts.
[02:46:21.455 --> 02:46:21.855]  Go ahead.
[02:46:21.875 --> 02:46:24.056]  Alex, how are ya?
[02:46:24.576 --> 02:46:24.957]  Good, buddy.
[02:46:24.977 --> 02:46:25.597]  What's on your mind?
[02:46:26.677 --> 02:46:27.638]  Well, um...
[02:46:28.869 --> 02:46:29.830]  Uh, yeah.
[02:46:29.890 --> 02:46:30.530]  Climategate.
[02:46:30.810 --> 02:46:31.671]  Don't worry about it.
[02:46:31.831 --> 02:46:33.252]  They've already started spinning it.
[02:46:33.272 --> 02:46:34.853]  I was looking at a BBC story.
[02:46:35.714 --> 02:46:41.338]  What people in America and Canada both have to understand is that the coups have already taken place.
[02:46:42.578 --> 02:46:44.940]  Especially in America, you have a republic we don't.
[02:46:45.580 --> 02:46:53.905]  Okay, and if I'm not mistaken, your Constitution tells the American people straight out that when tyranny comes, that you have to go and change things.
[02:46:53.985 --> 02:46:57.147]  Now, I've talked to some other people on radio stations down in the United States.
[02:46:58.268 --> 02:46:59.529]  I think Craig is from Oklahoma.
[02:46:59.569 --> 02:47:02.751]  I was listening to a senator from Oklahoma, and he said it very simply.
[02:47:04.052 --> 02:47:08.675]  There's very few of them, and a lot of us, all we have to do is stand up, and they're forced to stand down.
[02:47:09.555 --> 02:47:15.159]  Now, the coup has taken place from the top all the way down to your local municipal governments.
[02:47:15.686 --> 02:47:19.027]  Go get those first, get your people, get a hold of those local governments.
[02:47:19.947 --> 02:47:27.809]  The other option is to take a half a million people, or however many people you think is necessary, and I don't know why the American people haven't done it yet.
[02:47:29.570 --> 02:47:31.891]  Most of this stuff is just noise that's going on.
[02:47:32.331 --> 02:47:36.172]  It is your duty to go back and take back your government.
[02:47:36.332 --> 02:47:43.854]  Alright, listen, I appreciate your call, and this is a good final point to make here before we maybe jam in one or two more, and I apologize to the callers.
[02:47:45.091 --> 02:47:49.433]  If we tried to march on Washington, they would detonate truck bombs or something and say we did it.
[02:47:50.053 --> 02:47:50.534]  Okay?
[02:47:50.554 --> 02:47:54.336]  I mean, this is a very sophisticated game we're up against here.
[02:47:54.716 --> 02:47:59.698]  Sure, the Declaration of Independence says we could all lock and load this government's criminal and start cleaning them out.
[02:48:00.278 --> 02:48:04.801]  But then innocent people would get killed, the media would hype that up, this is a 21st century battle.
[02:48:05.541 --> 02:48:07.743]  We have got to continue to educate people.
[02:48:07.803 --> 02:48:09.644]  It's all not just a bunch of noise.
[02:48:09.744 --> 02:48:10.285]  You're right.
[02:48:10.625 --> 02:48:11.446]  There's been a coup.
[02:48:11.486 --> 02:48:12.727]  We now have the secret U.N.
[02:48:12.767 --> 02:48:13.247]  documents.
[02:48:13.507 --> 02:48:16.009]  How they covertly took over your local towns and cities.
[02:48:16.410 --> 02:48:17.290]  And it's U.N.
[02:48:17.350 --> 02:48:19.552]  curriculum brainwashing your kids right now.
[02:48:19.932 --> 02:48:21.454]  This article bombshell U.N.
[02:48:21.494 --> 02:48:22.815]  documents outlaw plan.
[02:48:24.016 --> 02:48:29.320]  Outline plan to use Climategate crooks in run around national sovereignty.
[02:48:30.060 --> 02:48:31.301]  I mean we have the proof.
[02:48:31.642 --> 02:48:34.364]  But Craig Roberts final comments on what he just said.
[02:48:35.310 --> 02:48:35.890]  Well, he's right.
[02:48:35.930 --> 02:48:43.153]  You know, you have to organize at the lowest level and you have to get control, but you have to educate your own local politicians that they're the bosses, not those guys in Washington.
[02:48:43.233 --> 02:48:44.594]  Washington is the little government.
[02:48:44.694 --> 02:48:45.414]  We're the big government.
[02:48:45.434 --> 02:48:49.076]  What would happen if we had a 500,000 person march on Washington?
[02:48:50.196 --> 02:48:51.757]  About the same thing as the Tea Party.
[02:48:51.817 --> 02:48:54.798]  The media wouldn't report it, so therefore it didn't happen.
[02:48:55.098 --> 02:48:57.539]  No, I think he was talking about a physical takeover.
[02:48:58.021 --> 02:49:04.645]  Well, yeah, if you had 500,000 people with guns and leaders and stuff like that, head for Washington, you'd find a ghost town by the time you got there.
[02:49:05.485 --> 02:49:09.268]  And all the politicians would be, and bureaucrats would be someplace else.
[02:49:10.969 --> 02:49:16.412]  You know, people think about that kind of stuff, but that's just not going to happen.
[02:49:16.452 --> 02:49:20.674]  You know, you've got a lot of people out here saying, well, I'd sure like to have something happen, but we need leadership.
[02:49:20.694 --> 02:49:21.715]  We need somebody to do it.
[02:49:21.755 --> 02:49:23.055]  We need, you know, yadda yadda yadda.
[02:49:23.816 --> 02:49:25.057]  The problem with that is,
[02:49:26.775 --> 02:49:30.076]  It just isn't going to happen the way our society is built up today.
[02:49:30.196 --> 02:49:34.958]  Look, the first person who really was real, if it's some provocateur, they let them call for it.
[02:49:35.178 --> 02:49:37.539]  But let's say, I'm the real deal, you're the real deal.
[02:49:37.759 --> 02:49:46.921]  If we started saying, let's have an armed march next month on Washington, they'd arrest our butts so fast the SWAT teams would say we tried to do something and kill us deader than a hammer.
[02:49:47.402 --> 02:49:51.723]  I'm sure there's something in the Patriot Act or something that prohibits even talking like that.
[02:49:52.443 --> 02:49:55.986]  You know, anytime anybody... I mean, we've lost the First Amendment.
[02:49:56.506 --> 02:49:58.787]  We've lost a lot of the Second Amendment.
[02:49:59.488 --> 02:50:01.049]  The Tenth Amendment's being ignored.
[02:50:01.089 --> 02:50:03.531]  The Fifth Amendment is kind of pushed off to one side.
[02:50:04.211 --> 02:50:08.194]  And we've got politicians in Washington right now who have never read the whole Constitution.
[02:50:08.314 --> 02:50:09.135]  And D.C.
[02:50:09.215 --> 02:50:12.597]  is like a auction block.
[02:50:13.097 --> 02:50:14.478]  The globalists are corporate.
[02:50:16.476 --> 02:50:20.939]  We got places like Cheyenne Mountain and places in Colorado Springs that really run the country.
[02:50:21.279 --> 02:50:23.380]  That's just a bunch of political whores in Washington.
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:25.341]  We have to take the minds and hearts back.
[02:50:25.662 --> 02:50:29.824]  RifleWarrior.com, Colonel Craig Roberts, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:50:30.104 --> 02:50:32.006]  We're going to talk to you again first of the year.
[02:50:32.366 --> 02:50:32.986]  Will do it, Alex.
[02:50:33.507 --> 02:50:34.267]  Thank you so much.
[02:50:34.507 --> 02:50:35.408]  Great job, crew.
[02:50:35.468 --> 02:50:36.548]  Great job to all the callers.
[02:50:36.969 --> 02:50:38.770]  Everybody else, retransmission starts now.

[02:50:49.222 --> 02:50:54.408]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:50:54.548 --> 02:50:56.510]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:58.913]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:50:59.073 --> 02:51:00.935]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:51:01.355 --> 02:51:02.696]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:51:02.977 --> 02:51:03.998]  There is a solution.
[02:51:04.218 --> 02:51:12.262]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
