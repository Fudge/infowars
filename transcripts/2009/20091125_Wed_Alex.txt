[00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:05.111]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:06.873]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.655]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:10.217]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.217 --> 00:00:11.799]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.964]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.964 --> 00:00:20.028]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:24.864]  Well, the ADL has outdone themselves.
[00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:28.204]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this November 18th, Wednesday edition, 2009.
[00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:32.606]  As we accelerate into the depths of fall nearing winter, and the end of this
[00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:55.663]  This calendar year we can certainly pat ourselves on the back that we are making major headway against the globalists.
[00:00:55.663 --> 00:01:11.286]  They have a lot of the big head cards and they've got the organization and the funds, but the establishment is really starting to panic and try to bully the American people into shutting their mouths.
[00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:16.887]  They're trying to issue a chilling effect edict that anyone that reads the New York Times
[00:01:17.617 --> 00:01:46.640]  When Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General of the UN, calls for world government, if you say there is a world government when you read it in hundreds of newspapers per day now, literally every day, hundreds per day, go to Google, type in world government, new world order, click Google News, hundreds a day, thousands a week, 12,000 in one day back during the G20, 12,000 articles calling for world government and the end of the dollar.
[00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:50.060]  And carbon taxes.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.543]  And one-child policies worldwide.
[00:01:54.543 --> 00:02:01.887]  And if you come out and read out of the New York Times, the ADL calls you an anti-Semite.
[00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:04.609]  I mean, this is insane!
[00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.132]  But it's just like what Chris Matthews is doing.
[00:02:09.132 --> 00:02:12.794]  And the other host on, especially MSNBC, but CNBC, CNN,
[00:02:13.823 --> 00:02:15.505]  Anderson Cooper does it.
[00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:24.032]  If you say that Obama's policies are socialistic, really they're a wealth transfer to the elite, but on the surface it is socialistic.
[00:02:24.032 --> 00:02:28.235]  Newsweek headline, we're all socialists now, remember that cover?
[00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:35.562]  So they could admit it's socialist, but then if you say, hey, I don't want to live under socialism, it doesn't work too well,
[00:02:38.078 --> 00:02:41.320]  Chris Matthews, the ADL, comes out and attacks you.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:56.588]  Ladies and gentlemen, the ADL is now attacking Lou Dobbs, Glenn Beck, Michelle Malkin, myself, in the most savage attacks I have ever seen.
[00:02:56.588 --> 00:03:00.670]  And CBS News covered it, Jerusalem Post covered it, scores of other newspapers
[00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.212]  Are now running with it and here's what's really wild about it.
[00:03:05.212 --> 00:03:10.737]  I'm gonna break it all down today and tell you about the guests that are coming up, but this is big.
[00:03:10.737 --> 00:03:25.269]  Is that they have six new reports on the ADL website and I am listed in five of the reports as the arch enemy.
[00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.093]  I am listed as powerful and incredibly popular and incredibly
[00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:32.566]  Well, I mean, that's what the New Republic did.
[00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:34.647]  They said, I mesmerize people.
[00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:35.467]  I mesmerize them?
[00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:40.170]  You mean I go, oh, here's the New York Times saying, world government, we're going to pay taxes to the UN.
[00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.551]  Oh, I'm so mesmerizing.
[00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:43.091]  I mean, come on!
[00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:52.676]  What's mesmerizing people is that the mainstream media demonized anybody that talked about this in the last 20 years and tried to attach anti-Semitism.
[00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:59.700]  It's actually the government, the ADL, and the media that always jump into everything and put it in people's minds.
[00:04:00.478 --> 00:04:03.600]  That it's Jews, and they know what they're doing.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:15.948]  So they can then demonize the movement against the globalists, and keep mainline folks from joining it, where you open the newspaper up and it says, world government's being announced, and it's good.
[00:04:15.948 --> 00:04:21.092]  Well wait, Alex Jones has said this for years, but I better not talk about it, because I'll be called an anti-Semite.
[00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:22.893]  What does it have to do with that?
[00:04:22.893 --> 00:04:25.975]  They're making it about that, and that's why the federal government's been caught.
[00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:32.408]  Over and over and over again, Southern Poverty Law Center and others running the white supremacist groups.
[00:04:32.408 --> 00:04:34.868]  Not infiltrating them, running them.
[00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:37.129]  That's why they have these groups attacking who?
[00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.729]  Me!
[00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.770]  Who's the number one enemy of the Nazis?
[00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.791]  They attack me more than they attack Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:46.712]  We're going to explain how this works today.
[00:04:46.712 --> 00:04:49.173]  This is the deep secrets of the New World Order.
[00:04:49.173 --> 00:04:50.793]  Believe me, they're not going to like it.
[00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:55.095]  I'm their number one enemy because I've got your number, Jack.
[00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:55.635]  You got me?
[00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:03.465]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:05:03.465 --> 00:05:07.087]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:05:07.087 --> 00:05:11.669]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.252]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[00:05:17.552 --> 00:05:22.315]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:05:22.315 --> 00:05:25.938]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:05:25.938 --> 00:05:30.761]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:37.325]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:05:37.325 --> 00:05:39.267]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:05:39.747 --> 00:05:42.951]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:05:42.951 --> 00:05:47.455]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[00:05:47.455 --> 00:05:49.618]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:05:49.618 --> 00:05:49.678]  877-327-0365.
[00:05:49.678 --> 00:05:50.719]  Don't wait, call today!
[00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.801]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:09.126]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:09.126 --> 00:06:11.187]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:16.191]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:17.092]  How much do you want?
[00:06:17.352 --> 00:06:18.473]  When do you want it?
[00:06:18.473 --> 00:06:20.355]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:20.355 --> 00:06:21.435]  When will you need it?
[00:06:21.435 --> 00:06:23.637]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:23.637 --> 00:06:24.978]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:24.978 --> 00:06:26.500]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.764]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:31.764 --> 00:06:35.367]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:35.367 --> 00:06:38.830]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.391]  How much will you need?
[00:06:40.391 --> 00:06:41.292]  We don't know.
[00:06:41.292 --> 00:06:42.393]  How much do you want?
[00:06:42.393 --> 00:06:43.334]  All you can get.
[00:06:43.334 --> 00:06:44.436]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:47.479]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.261]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:49.261 --> 00:06:50.181]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:59.713 --> 00:07:05.020]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.566]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:07:09.566 --> 00:07:11.829]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:13.451]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:14.493]  There is a solution.
[00:07:14.713 --> 00:07:23.138]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:07:23.138 --> 00:07:30.602]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:07:36.646 --> 00:07:42.209]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:46.791]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:52.994]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[00:07:52.994 --> 00:07:54.255]  866-762-9238.
[00:07:54.255 --> 00:08:04.800]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.100]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.061]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.624]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.624 --> 00:08:11.206]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.206 --> 00:08:12.748]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.748 --> 00:08:16.952]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.952 --> 00:08:20.997]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.147 --> 00:08:32.128]  We're here live, Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:32.729]  to 3 p.m.
[00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:34.369]  Central, 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:08:34.369 --> 00:08:34.930]  Eastern.
[00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:38.891]  I come back Sundays, abbreviated transmission, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:41.292]  Central.
[00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:43.533]  Let me tell you about the different guests we have on with us.
[00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:58.000]  We have the former head of policy, number two at the Department of the Treasury, also former Wall Street Journal editor, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, coming on to cover the 15-month low for the dollar.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:06.585]  And why gold has gone up to $1,150 an ounce today.
[00:09:06.585 --> 00:09:09.367]  In futures, it's trading even higher.
[00:09:09.367 --> 00:09:15.791]  Gold hits record near $1,150 an ounce as dollar slips Reuters headline.
[00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:21.115]  Then George Humphrey is going to be back in studio with us today.
[00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:24.857]  Former city council member in Austin, documentary filmmaker, author, good friend of mine.
[00:09:24.857 --> 00:09:27.419]  I want to talk to him about a host of issues.
[00:09:28.237 --> 00:09:39.145]  And then we've never had her on, and people have requested her, and I'm excited to tell you that she's going to be on with us to cover what's happening with the economy, the police state, and so much more.
[00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:53.415]  We have Katherine Austin Fitz, and she was the President of Hamilton Securities Group Investment Bank and Financial Software Developer, Assistant Secretary of Housing for the Federal Housing Commissioner under Bush 1, Managing Director.
[00:09:54.008 --> 00:09:55.789]  She was number two at HUD, basically.
[00:09:55.789 --> 00:09:59.372]  Managing Director and member of the board of Wall Street firm Dillon Reed & Co.
[00:09:59.372 --> 00:10:01.533]  That's super high-powered.
[00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:12.761]  Catherine has designed and closed over $25 billion of transactions and investments to date, and has led portfolio strategy for $300 billion of financial asset liabilities.
[00:10:12.761 --> 00:10:14.723]  Solari.com's her site.
[00:10:14.723 --> 00:10:18.125]  So we're very excited to have her coming on today for her maiden voyage with us.
[00:10:21.638 --> 00:10:23.580]  So that is coming up today.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.944]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, George Humphrey, and Katherine Austin Fitz.
[00:10:28.944 --> 00:10:36.090]  George Humphrey will be in studio.
[00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:46.038]  My mind has been racing with all of the hypocrisy, with all of the corruption,
[00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:56.924]  And also with the exhilaration of the fact that we are certainly making headway against the New World Order.
[00:10:56.924 --> 00:11:11.899]  The humbling realization that this radio show and the films I make and the websites are now being recognized across the globe by mainstream media publications
[00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:21.443]  As the most substantial and virulent threat to their power structure.
[00:11:21.443 --> 00:11:32.188]  The ADL has mirrored what has been said in the New Republic and Salon and in George Soros publications, but in a much more vicious format.
[00:11:32.188 --> 00:11:42.653]  And they've declared me the conspiracy king, incredibly powerful, incredibly influential, incredibly popular, and I don't like that.
[00:11:43.314 --> 00:11:45.015]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:11:45.015 --> 00:11:59.207]  To have the eye of Sauron staring directly at me, when I'm trying to get the ring under the crack of doom, that's a little Hollywood analogy for folks, it's not fun.
[00:11:59.207 --> 00:12:12.278]  And I've been making the point for the last six months or so, that not just indicators in the media and from government, but also dirty tricks being played on us, whisper campaigns, disinformation campaigns, from all sides, all angles,
[00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:16.857]  It's creepy!
[00:12:16.857 --> 00:12:22.444]  And then it was reported, and then Senator Lamar Alexander also spoke on the floor about this.
[00:12:22.444 --> 00:12:24.766]  There is a White House enemies list.
[00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:26.709]  I am in the top 25 names.
[00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:28.571]  That's creepy!
[00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:34.558]  I mean, I never expected, and I'm talking about this from my perspective because it's the best way for me to be able to relay it to you.
[00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:46.195]  I never expected 14 years ago when I went down and started an AXS TV show in a broom closet, the size of a broom closet, out of the control room.
[00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:48.296]  I didn't have any crews, I did it out of the control room myself.
[00:12:48.296 --> 00:12:50.316]  I just brought a camera in there.
[00:12:50.316 --> 00:12:57.859]  I had no inkling, no delusions of grandeur, nothing.
[00:12:57.859 --> 00:12:59.719]  I couldn't watch myself on television.
[00:12:59.719 --> 00:13:01.220]  I hated doing it.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.061]  Hated it!
[00:13:03.061 --> 00:13:03.881]  But I hated
[00:13:04.782 --> 00:13:20.409]  Watching the Democrats go after my guns, and I hated watching the City Council steal old people's property with $1,000 a day fines for three-inch grass.
[00:13:20.409 --> 00:13:23.291]  By the way, there's a big headline today in the news in Florida.
[00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:26.932]  $1,000 a day fines for three-inch grass.
[00:13:26.932 --> 00:13:29.073]  Funny, because that's the point.
[00:13:29.073 --> 00:13:31.495]  You can go see AXS TV shows I did in 96.
[00:13:32.964 --> 00:13:36.867]  When I would go out and interview the old people they were, because they have databases.
[00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:38.268]  They target old people.
[00:13:38.268 --> 00:13:53.818]  When you go in the hospital and you've got cancer and they find out you live alone, it gets filed with the health department that you're at risk, and then that's given to special units in the city council, and then they have special predatory units in the police department that help shake you down.
[00:13:53.818 --> 00:13:59.662]  First code enforcement comes, then the police come to your door, ask if you have a problem, and they beat you up.
[00:13:59.662 --> 00:14:00.482]  They take you to jail.
[00:14:00.482 --> 00:14:01.683]  That happened to Roland Ellingston.
[00:14:04.605 --> 00:14:21.134]  I mean, when I found out that the town where I live has predatory groups in the government that feed on weak people, as a 21, 22 year old, I got mad.
[00:14:21.134 --> 00:14:28.137]  And all my instincts for war, all my instincts for resistance, are there for a reason.
[00:14:28.137 --> 00:14:29.798]  It's to defend women and children and old people.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:42.445]  But they misplace our manhood into strutting around with high-powered weapons and camouflage and going and basically oppressing third-world cavemen.
[00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:43.625]  I'm not saying you're not tough.
[00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:46.006]  I'm not saying you're not brave.
[00:14:46.006 --> 00:14:49.528]  I'm telling you, all those energies are being wasted.
[00:14:49.528 --> 00:14:55.670]  More than wasted, they're being abused.
[00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.451]  And I'm nothing special.
[00:14:58.451 --> 00:14:59.772]  I'm just somebody that got angry.
[00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:01.887]  I started studying.
[00:15:01.887 --> 00:15:08.912]  I mean, I was a mainline Republican slash Ron Paul Libertarian when I first got started.
[00:15:08.912 --> 00:15:11.594]  And then I learned more and more and more.
[00:15:11.594 --> 00:15:20.621]  I mean, I'd read books about the New World Order and I'd read None Dare Call a Conspiracy when I was in high school, but it wasn't real.
[00:15:20.621 --> 00:15:21.742]  I didn't disbelieve it.
[00:15:21.742 --> 00:15:23.903]  It was just books I'd read.
[00:15:23.903 --> 00:15:27.446]  I wasn't consciously acting on it.
[00:15:27.446 --> 00:15:29.848]  I wasn't consciously looking through that lens.
[00:15:30.478 --> 00:15:36.383]  But let me tell you something, I found the New World Order right here in my town where I live.
[00:15:36.383 --> 00:15:47.091]  I found police and government bureaucrats who mercilessly steal innocent people's children for no reason, just to fill quotas and make money.
[00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:58.640]  I watched them take ranchers and farmers' property so that city council members could take control of it and make hundreds of millions of dollars selling it to build high-rise hotels and
[00:16:00.134 --> 00:16:16.290]  Golf courses, subdivisions, and I watch good police and bureaucrats and people right next to them with blinders on, ignoring the evil that was happening right in front of their face through peer pressure.
[00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:22.016]  So I want to say to the ADL, before I start really breaking this down piece by piece, and to the
[00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.852]  George Soros crowd and the neocon crowd.
[00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:27.473]  I mean, they all attack me.
[00:16:27.473 --> 00:16:29.274]  All the establishment attacks me.
[00:16:29.274 --> 00:16:31.136]  The Nazis attack me.
[00:16:31.136 --> 00:16:38.301]  The ADL goes after me.
[00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:39.501]  Just every group.
[00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:41.443]  I'm sure most of you out there have seen it.
[00:16:41.443 --> 00:16:45.085]  There's a concerted campaign for years, but it's intensifying.
[00:16:45.085 --> 00:16:50.289]  And I knew it was going to have the opposite effect, because I understand
[00:16:50.851 --> 00:16:57.293]  I think better than some of the old fossils that are still running the new order system, how the internet really works.
[00:16:57.293 --> 00:17:04.214]  And I have confidence in my message, and so I know all these demonization campaigns actually help me.
[00:17:04.214 --> 00:17:11.816]  Because people want to go check out this Alex Jones, they want to find out what all the hubbub is about, and then they find out the true message.
[00:17:13.388 --> 00:17:18.549]  And intellectually, and in their gut, and in their spirit, they know I'm bona fide and for real.
[00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:31.331]  Warts and all, I'm not perfect, but they know the real deal, because you're the real deal out there, and you're the real power of this radio show.
[00:17:31.331 --> 00:17:41.993]  Now, a lot of the old globalists are dying off or retiring and handing it over to the next room, who still are intelligent and sophisticated, and have even smarter people under them,
[00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:46.921]  Who are young.
[00:17:46.921 --> 00:17:50.343]  But a total evolution in media and culture and everything.
[00:17:50.343 --> 00:17:55.966]  And they've been advising them for years that I am extremely dangerous to them.
[00:17:55.966 --> 00:18:05.291]  And that we shouldn't just be ignored, that we should be demonized and smashed.
[00:18:05.291 --> 00:18:11.555]  But I've seen a change in the attacks, not just the massive intensification, but a major shift
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:31.970]  From just throwing a wall of noise and lies up, they've now stopped that bombardment and are now shifting to a new bombardment, saying this guy's dangerous and could cause a revolution.
[00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.431]  He needs to be dealt with.
[00:18:34.431 --> 00:18:42.636]  And just like in the final scene of the Body Snatchers from the 1970s, where the lady walks up to her friend and says, Bob, Bob, you know, did they,
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:44.801]  Where's our friends?
[00:18:44.801 --> 00:18:46.863]  And Bob starts hissing at her.
[00:18:46.863 --> 00:18:49.164]  He's been taken over by them.
[00:18:49.164 --> 00:18:52.507]  Basically, the alarm alert is going up now.
[00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:58.512]  The air raid sirens are going off inside the wolf's lair of the New World Order.
[00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:01.895]  And they are saying, this man is dangerous.
[00:19:01.895 --> 00:19:04.537]  He needs to be arrested.
[00:19:04.537 --> 00:19:06.839]  He needs to be stopped.
[00:19:06.839 --> 00:19:07.920]  He needs to be killed.
[00:19:14.036 --> 00:19:16.217]  I don't have any delusions of grandeur.
[00:19:16.217 --> 00:19:20.898]  I know they could smash me flat in a pancake, do a bloody mess.
[00:19:20.898 --> 00:19:30.781]  Or they could set me up this afternoon, drive it home, pull me over and throw a bag of heroin in the back of my car.
[00:19:30.781 --> 00:19:36.743]  I have no illusions about the truth.
[00:19:36.743 --> 00:19:39.704]  But see, they understand the secret.
[00:19:39.704 --> 00:19:41.725]  They know they've lost real credibility.
[00:19:42.603 --> 00:19:45.806]  With the entire population.
[00:19:45.806 --> 00:19:52.070]  And they understand now that no matter what they do, the battle is now joined.
[00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.133]  The people are now up on their hind legs.
[00:19:55.133 --> 00:19:56.814]  The war is now beginning.
[00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.474]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[00:21:00.716 --> 00:21:02.878]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.878 --> 00:21:03.738]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.738 --> 00:21:04.059]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:09.102]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:10.743]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.743 --> 00:21:11.484]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.484 --> 00:21:13.005]  Yeah, Startpage.com.
[00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:15.967]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.967 --> 00:21:19.830]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.632]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.972 --> 00:21:25.193]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.193 --> 00:21:27.174]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.174 --> 00:21:27.474]  Right!

[00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:32.716]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.716 --> 00:21:36.558]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.

[00:22:00.464 --> 00:22:06.788]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[00:22:06.788 --> 00:22:11.732]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[00:22:11.732 --> 00:22:15.815]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[00:22:15.815 --> 00:22:17.155]  Let's put this another way.
[00:22:17.155 --> 00:22:22.519]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[00:22:22.519 --> 00:22:25.421]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[00:22:25.421 --> 00:22:28.063]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[00:22:28.063 --> 00:22:29.444]  You can possess it in your hand.
[00:22:29.764 --> 00:22:31.045]  You can take it with you.
[00:22:31.045 --> 00:22:32.506]  Gold is real money.
[00:22:32.506 --> 00:22:33.867]  Gold is honest money.
[00:22:33.867 --> 00:22:36.589]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.

[00:23:56.791 --> 00:23:59.954]  Season's greetings and health and wellness from Excalibur Dehydrator.
[00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:08.392]  Hi Alex, this is Noah from Houston.
[00:24:08.392 --> 00:24:29.608]  It seems to me that the NSA's one of their primary objectives is to secure the technological monopoly of the globalists by developing cutting-edge technology through DARPA, and then when the time is right, allowing that technology to be patented by one of their global corporations that is in the military-industrial complex in which they own.
[00:24:29.608 --> 00:24:33.651]  My question is, A, is this an accurate assessment of the NSA
[00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:36.540]  I'm in favor of eugenics.
[00:25:03.379 --> 00:25:19.752]  You take a walk down, a trip down to your local Walmart, and look around, and about 99% of the people are people that you do not want to be breeding and having babies.
[00:25:19.752 --> 00:25:21.754]  Thank you.
[00:25:21.754 --> 00:25:22.895]  Goodbye.
[00:25:22.895 --> 00:25:26.858]  That's the new InfoWars radio comment line.
[00:25:29.172 --> 00:25:29.953]  512-646-4444.
[00:25:29.953 --> 00:25:36.917]  We're going to be playing those each and every day, Monday through Sunday.
[00:25:36.917 --> 00:25:39.599]  We're on the radio six days a week.
[00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:50.927]  I'm going to address CBS Nightly News, the Jerusalem Post, the ADL, that all tried to savage yours truly yesterday.
[00:25:50.927 --> 00:25:57.591]  I want to break down the entire paradigm coming up in the next segment.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:14.147]  But commenting on those two calls, here in my stack I have a mainstream news article stating that the National Security Agency is offering Microsoft a patch for Windows!
[00:26:14.147 --> 00:26:20.269]  And it's come out in federal court many times that back doors have been built in all the major software systems.
[00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:25.892]  Occasionally, a new encryption comes out or a new form of communication comes out and
[00:26:27.506 --> 00:26:43.464]  The CIA, the FBI, Interpol, and Europe go after the groups, sometimes taking them over, sometimes even killing the CEOs if they refuse to hand it over, and then issue a new version with a backdoor in it.
[00:26:44.272 --> 00:26:48.955]  Remember I told you over a decade ago that OnStar is used to dial in and listen to you in your car.
[00:26:48.955 --> 00:26:50.335]  That's now mainstream news.
[00:26:50.335 --> 00:26:52.537]  Told you in 96 that your cell phones are being used.
[00:26:52.537 --> 00:26:55.258]  They dial in and listen even when they're off under federal law.
[00:26:55.258 --> 00:26:57.419]  They're designed to do that under federal law.
[00:26:57.419 --> 00:27:01.221]  Actually international law, but the feds have complied.
[00:27:01.221 --> 00:27:02.342]  It's now mainstream news.
[00:27:02.342 --> 00:27:05.343]  Again, all I'm doing is telling you what's in the documents.
[00:27:05.343 --> 00:27:11.167]  So yes, they're at least 30 years advanced in many forms of technology.
[00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:13.628]  They roll them out through select corporations.
[00:27:14.657 --> 00:27:17.238]  IBM is a government front.
[00:27:17.238 --> 00:27:20.078]  That's come out in declassified reports.
[00:27:20.078 --> 00:27:36.443]  They were afraid of the Sherman antitrust laws in the 70s and early 80s, so they set up Bill Gates, whose father was the head of Planned Parenthood and had been in army intelligence, to give Bill Gates his own duopoly or oligopoly.
[00:27:36.443 --> 00:27:38.383]  It's a cartel.
[00:27:38.383 --> 00:27:41.364]  And so, yes, the world has adopted their grid
[00:27:42.762 --> 00:27:50.145]  Notice ICANN was private, but DARPA gave them the registration domain name system.
[00:27:50.145 --> 00:27:55.806]  Now, that was given to the United Nations via ICANN a month ago.
[00:27:55.806 --> 00:27:57.427]  So, the U.S.
[00:27:57.427 --> 00:28:01.648]  in 45 set up the U.N., and then they have the U.N.
[00:28:01.648 --> 00:28:04.569]  absorb the United States.
[00:28:04.569 --> 00:28:07.710]  By U.S., the powerful interest in the U.S.
[00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:12.312]  The United States created the Internet, and then gave it to the world, if you believe that.
[00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:37.130]  And so, just as they give the world the mass technologies that have their back doors, they sell the public cell phones that you pay money for, that then track and trace everything you do and control your life, your little personal computer that you carry around with you, that creates a psychological algorithm, a psychological profile of your personality type.
[00:28:38.695 --> 00:28:40.776]  This is the data management system.
[00:28:40.776 --> 00:28:54.805]  And, again, I would tell people about this 10, 12 years ago because I would read it in science publications, in trade publications of high-tech, Silicon Valley, Pentagon announcements, defense contractor announcements.
[00:28:54.805 --> 00:29:05.292]  I mean, Google announced five years ago they're using the audio mics and video cameras, standard on all new computers now, to watch you and listen to you.
[00:29:05.292 --> 00:29:08.094]  But they said, don't worry, we're only using computers to do that.
[00:29:09.591 --> 00:29:11.853]  And then we have ads pop up on the screen.
[00:29:11.853 --> 00:29:14.254]  So it isn't just where you visit.
[00:29:14.254 --> 00:29:24.242]  You ever notice you're on sites and, you know, you can be on the New York Times and ads are popping up for the dry cleaners a mile from your house, saying, hey, this place is a mile from your house.
[00:29:24.242 --> 00:29:25.883]  That's only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:29:25.883 --> 00:29:30.346]  As for the eugenics caller, the elite want you dead, Bubba.
[00:29:30.346 --> 00:29:31.427]  See how that works?
[00:29:31.427 --> 00:29:33.909]  Sure, you want some living space, some Lebenstrau.
[00:29:35.785 --> 00:29:37.105]  You're not going to be getting it.
[00:29:37.105 --> 00:29:37.765]  You understand?
[00:29:37.765 --> 00:29:39.646]  You are targeted for termination.
[00:29:39.646 --> 00:29:42.206]  You're a would-be wannabe elitist.
[00:29:42.206 --> 00:29:43.747]  Sure, there are a lot of slobs out there.
[00:29:43.747 --> 00:29:45.767]  Doesn't mean you have a right to kill them.
[00:29:45.767 --> 00:29:46.787]  You got that, pal?
[00:29:46.787 --> 00:29:50.888]  Why don't you try to help them?
[00:29:50.888 --> 00:29:52.269]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:54.809]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.809 --> 00:29:57.490]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.285 --> 00:30:07.271]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:30:07.271 --> 00:30:09.353]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:30:09.353 --> 00:30:11.595]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:30:11.595 --> 00:30:13.257]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:31:00.009 --> 00:31:04.572]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.572 --> 00:31:05.473]  Number one.
[00:31:05.473 --> 00:31:08.916]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.916 --> 00:31:09.756]  Number two.
[00:31:09.756 --> 00:31:14.660]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:15.400]  It's true.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:20.284]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.284 --> 00:31:21.105]  Number three.
[00:31:21.105 --> 00:31:24.687]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.687 --> 00:31:28.390]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.391]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.391 --> 00:31:32.153]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.153 --> 00:31:35.815]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.815 --> 00:31:36.616]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.616 --> 00:31:40.759]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.759 --> 00:31:45.522]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:33:24.621 --> 00:33:45.901]  Livin' on the road, my friend Was gonna keep you free and clean And now you wear your skin like iron And your breath as hard as kerosene Weren't your mama's only boy But her favorite one, it seems
[00:33:48.336 --> 00:33:55.243]  She began to cry when you said goodbye.
[00:33:55.243 --> 00:34:01.729]  He sank into your dream.
[00:34:01.729 --> 00:34:04.752]  Poncho was a bandit boy.
[00:34:04.752 --> 00:34:09.417]  His horse was fast as Polly's steel.
[00:34:09.417 --> 00:34:12.020]  He wore his gun outside his pants.
[00:34:13.255 --> 00:34:34.117]  For all the honest world to feel Pancho met his match, you know From the deserts down in Mexico Nobody heard his dying words Oh, but that's the way it goes Oh, but that's the way it goes
[00:34:43.814 --> 00:34:56.778]  We're now going to get into the giant assault by CBS News, The Jerusalem Post, George Soros Publications, The New Republic.
[00:34:56.778 --> 00:34:59.979]  A giant concerted attack yesterday.
[00:34:59.979 --> 00:35:08.361]  The ADL has billed yours truly the conspiracy king.
[00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:18.095]  And we're going to have a three-part series on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, today, tomorrow, and Friday.
[00:35:18.095 --> 00:35:25.040]  ADL calls Alex Jones conspiracy king, insinuates he should be removed from society.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:36.487]  So they tried ignoring me, then they tried laughing at me, then they tried attacking, now they're talking about arresting.
[00:35:39.819 --> 00:36:04.507]  And in all of these articles, they're stating that I am causing violence, and that I'm basically calling for violence, and that I am a liar, and that I must be stopped, and that I, Alex Jones, am the kingpin, the number one threat.
[00:36:04.507 --> 00:36:07.468]  These are very serious, serious people.
[00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:17.752]  And so I want to go over this very important subject.
[00:36:17.752 --> 00:36:24.195]  Because it affects everyone.
[00:36:24.195 --> 00:36:30.377]  I don't really know where to start.
[00:36:30.377 --> 00:36:36.939]  I don't know where to begin.
[00:36:39.449 --> 00:37:04.756]  Should I go over all the lies and distortions in the five, five yesterday, a couple more in the last month, seven different national intelligence reports given to all police departments in the country, given to the Pentagon, issued to the FBI,
[00:37:08.351 --> 00:37:14.559]  Should I go over these reports where they lie?
[00:37:14.559 --> 00:37:16.882]  And say that I'm making it up?
[00:37:16.882 --> 00:37:24.791]  That in Arcadia?
[00:37:24.791 --> 00:37:26.654]  That in Arcadia in the Midwest?
[00:37:32.392 --> 00:37:36.594]  That the Pentagon announced in the local paper they were going to do a gun confiscation drill?
[00:37:36.594 --> 00:37:47.020]  I mean, they had a sergeant in the paper saying, we're going to do a drill where the gun shop dealers sold guns illegally, and we're going to go door-to-door asking people to search their homes.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:51.102]  I'm not the one that wrote that!
[00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:56.185]  Then they go and imply that I'm going to cause a violent attack on police and military.
[00:38:02.151 --> 00:38:10.215]  All I did was read the quotes out of the newspaper.
[00:38:10.215 --> 00:38:15.678]  They're hoping you don't go read that newspaper.
[00:38:15.678 --> 00:38:20.721]  And Paul Watson's done a general piece, he's gonna do other pieces that go through the distortions and disinformation.
[00:38:20.721 --> 00:38:31.447]  They have a whole nother report, actually two reports, where they talk about how I'm running around telling everyone that a world government's forming,
[00:38:32.392 --> 00:38:35.733]  And then a world government is going to come and get us?
[00:38:35.733 --> 00:38:39.533]  And that it's run by big banks?
[00:38:39.533 --> 00:38:41.494]  Well, there's a problem, ADL.
[00:38:41.494 --> 00:38:43.654]  There's a problem, CBS News.
[00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:46.154]  There's a problem, Jerusalem Post.
[00:38:46.154 --> 00:38:49.115]  There's a problem, Salon.
[00:38:49.115 --> 00:38:53.776]  There's a problem, New Republic.
[00:38:53.776 --> 00:38:56.276]  There's a problem, White House.
[00:38:56.276 --> 00:38:59.417]  We're in the top 25 of the White House enemies list.
[00:38:59.417 --> 00:39:00.277]  That's been confirmed.
[00:39:00.277 --> 00:39:01.717]  Mainstream media reports we've covered here.
[00:39:02.987 --> 00:39:21.705]  The problem is, every day if you go to a major search engine and type in the term New World Order, or World Government, or Global Government, or Death of the Dollar, or Carbon Tax, you will get hundreds and hundreds of news stories per day.
[00:39:21.705 --> 00:39:25.008]  Now, here's a few famous ones where they're particularly honest.
[00:39:26.437 --> 00:39:31.400]  One of them is written by Gideon Reitman, one of the editors at the Financial Times of London.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:37.563]  I'm sorry, ADL, the Financial Times of London does exist.
[00:39:37.563 --> 00:39:43.686]  The headline is, and now for world government.
[00:39:43.686 --> 00:39:49.049]  And he goes on to say, yes, we need an authoritarian world government.
[00:39:49.049 --> 00:39:51.530]  And yes, we kept it secret from you for your own good.
[00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.431]  I mean, go read the article.
[00:39:53.932 --> 00:40:00.294]  So, I'm bad, and this arch-devil, I've got to basically wear a yellow star.
[00:40:00.294 --> 00:40:01.494]  It's like I'm in Nazi Germany.
[00:40:01.494 --> 00:40:15.518]  They're saying, we've got to be tracked, we've got to be traced, we've got to be put on no-fly lists, we've got to have these Homeland Security and MIAC reports that we broke here, written by the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL.
[00:40:15.518 --> 00:40:17.439]  It's all pulled word-for-word from their reports.
[00:40:18.553 --> 00:40:23.695]  Where Homeland Security admits internally their whole reason for existing is the American people.
[00:40:23.695 --> 00:40:26.757]  Gun owners, libertarians, veterans, conservatives.
[00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:28.497]  People that don't like the private Federal Reserve.
[00:40:28.497 --> 00:40:30.038]  People that want to cut their taxes.
[00:40:30.038 --> 00:40:37.701]  We're allowed in America to have our political views that just so happen to line up with the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Declaration of Independence.
[00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:38.662]  You're the bad guys!
[00:40:40.655 --> 00:40:46.980]  And they have all these articles, a flotilla of them yesterday, saying it's bad and it's evil to be angry.
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:53.825]  It's bad, and the tea parties are bad, and Glenn Beck is bad, and Michelle... Malkin is bad.
[00:40:53.825 --> 00:41:05.053]  And, um... I mean, just basically that... that everybody... everybody is bad... who questions anything.
[00:41:07.592 --> 00:41:16.919]  And that it's un-American that we be involved in communities, and that we be marching, and that the American people stand up and say, we're not turning our guns in.
[00:41:16.919 --> 00:41:30.610]  And I'm particularly upset about the three percenters, as they call themselves, a lot of the military wearing those patches now, in-country, the Oath Keepers.
[00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:36.214]  They are really concerned about the military and police rediscovering who they really are, who they should be.
[00:41:36.969 --> 00:41:43.612]  And the police are feeling good, and the military are feeling good about themselves becoming true Americans again.
[00:41:43.612 --> 00:41:51.295]  Rediscovering who their ancestors are, what their birthright is, what their family name means.
[00:41:51.295 --> 00:41:56.698]  People that have felt horrible for years because subconsciously they know they're part of a bad system.
[00:41:56.698 --> 00:42:01.159]  Even if they themselves do a lot of good, they know the system's rotten!
[00:42:01.159 --> 00:42:02.560]  And things are out of control!
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.561]  And they're upset!
[00:42:10.037 --> 00:42:21.627]  And they're upset that veterans are reaching out to active duty people and that we're waking them up and that it's spreading like wildfire and they admit it's happening.
[00:42:21.627 --> 00:42:29.993]  The establishment admits that they're losing the fight against us.
[00:42:29.993 --> 00:42:36.279]  The peaceful fight.
[00:42:36.279 --> 00:42:38.360]  I mean, this is two weeks ago.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.101]  We can do it.
[00:42:39.981 --> 00:42:52.064]  New York Times, Ban Ki-moon, he exists, he is the UN Secretary General, the UN exists.
[00:42:52.064 --> 00:42:56.325]  Go over there to the east side of Manhattan, you can see it for yourself.
[00:42:56.325 --> 00:42:59.086]  And he calls for global government in this article.
[00:43:06.212 --> 00:43:11.136]  Fourth, from the last paragraph, a deal must include an equitable global governance structure.
[00:43:11.136 --> 00:43:16.400]  All countries must be involved in deciding how the resources are deployed and managed.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.682]  The U.N.
[00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:20.883]  will control it, but they'll listen to you.
[00:43:20.883 --> 00:43:24.046]  They promise.
[00:43:24.046 --> 00:43:26.127]  And they discuss in this article, written by the U.N.
[00:43:26.127 --> 00:43:28.609]  Secretary General, how the U.N.
[00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:31.051]  will tax and regulate every facet of your life.
[00:43:33.991 --> 00:43:48.455]  Hundreds of these articles a day, at the point where the establishment is announcing their global government takeover, their carbon tax, the IMF to be the private center of the new world government, run by private interests, will be paying your taxes to Al Gore.
[00:43:48.455 --> 00:43:50.476]  They called that a conspiracy theory three years ago.
[00:43:50.476 --> 00:43:51.356]  He now admits it.
[00:43:51.356 --> 00:43:55.758]  They'll be buying carbon credits from him.
[00:43:55.758 --> 00:44:00.139]  The UN will decide who can sell carbon credits and give it to all their little insider buddies.
[00:44:00.139 --> 00:44:03.420]  I mean, this is a new form of royalty, and you can't expect
[00:44:04.053 --> 00:44:16.337]  The American people to just sit here while you do this and do nothing.
[00:44:16.337 --> 00:44:26.300]  You can't expect the people of the world to sit back while financial, illegitimate, criminal interests conquer us.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:33.002]  Now, why is the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Centers the favorite vehicles
[00:44:33.692 --> 00:44:44.455]  By the private corporate networks that control government, the police, the military to go between government, the federal government, international government, state and local government.
[00:44:44.455 --> 00:44:45.535]  Why are they the favorite?
[00:44:45.535 --> 00:44:49.516]  Well, because it's basically a foreign intelligence operation on record.
[00:44:49.516 --> 00:44:55.517]  They've been caught breaking into police stations, moles in police stations, stealing police files to create private files on people.
[00:44:55.517 --> 00:44:58.098]  It's a Mossad operation.
[00:44:58.098 --> 00:45:00.558]  Now, why is the Mossad used for this?
[00:45:00.558 --> 00:45:02.079]  Well, the British intelligence, U.S.
[00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:02.579]  intelligence,
[00:45:04.065 --> 00:45:12.989]  And Israeli intelligence all work for each other, with each other, and they admit that they have US spies spy on the Brits for the Brits.
[00:45:12.989 --> 00:45:16.171]  British spies spy on the US for the US.
[00:45:16.171 --> 00:45:19.652]  It's admitted the NSA's main snooping arms are in England.
[00:45:19.652 --> 00:45:20.673]  That's how they would get around
[00:45:21.471 --> 00:45:24.952]  The federal laws previously, and vice versa with Israel.
[00:45:24.952 --> 00:45:38.038]  That's how they have another layer of plausible deniability, plus you don't end up having an agent spying on their own family, or someone who they support, or someone they know.
[00:45:38.038 --> 00:45:45.861]  So you have a group that's been caught, been arrested before, infiltrating police departments, well now they just publicly run them.
[00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:57.544]  And anytime you say, oh, I don't want a socialist health care plan, MSNBC, CNN, they all say, oh, racism, you hate black people.
[00:45:57.544 --> 00:46:05.127]  That's so black people and Hispanics think now, this is what they're trying to sell, it hasn't worked.
[00:46:05.127 --> 00:46:05.988]  It's multifaceted.
[00:46:05.988 --> 00:46:13.672]  They're telling black people and Hispanics, if you care about your race, your group, you've got to be for big government, socialism.
[00:46:13.672 --> 00:46:16.333]  You know, free market's a old white man thing.
[00:46:18.922 --> 00:46:20.443]  You know, let the bankers enslave you.
[00:46:20.443 --> 00:46:28.606]  We'll take good care of you here on the reservation.
[00:46:28.606 --> 00:46:32.967]  But it's also for guilty white people who, believe me, aren't racist.
[00:46:32.967 --> 00:46:35.548]  Most of them are just worshipful of anybody who isn't white.
[00:46:35.548 --> 00:46:36.429]  They hate themselves.
[00:46:36.429 --> 00:46:38.629]  They believe whites are scum and filth.
[00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:39.290]  Believe me.
[00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.890]  I'm white.
[00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:40.130]  I know.
[00:46:43.027 --> 00:46:48.208]  That makes them go, well I better not be against the healthcare plan, I don't want to be called a Nazi because I'm against socialism.
[00:46:48.208 --> 00:46:56.630]  What does... ...calling someone a socialist, when Newsweek had the cover story, we're all socialists now.
[00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:00.091]  See, when they're saying socialism's good, it's okay to say it, you're not a racist.
[00:47:00.091 --> 00:47:06.053]  But if you say it, and you go, I don't want it, oh, you don't like black people.
[00:47:06.053 --> 00:47:10.734]  It's in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:47:10.734 --> 00:47:10.994]  Clip.
[00:47:13.513 --> 00:47:23.299]  After clip, after clip of the news saying, oh look at the tea parties, they don't like Obama.
[00:47:23.299 --> 00:47:28.041]  Look at this woman, she's a racist, Chris Matthews.
[00:47:28.041 --> 00:47:30.503]  That Carlos Watson guy, black guy, period.
[00:47:30.503 --> 00:47:31.383]  You are a racist.
[00:47:31.383 --> 00:47:34.165]  No sir, you're worse than a racist, Mr. Watson.
[00:47:34.165 --> 00:47:39.968]  You're worse than a racist, Mr. Slime Bowl.
[00:47:41.618 --> 00:47:45.941]  Chris Matthews, because you consciously are using divide and conquer.
[00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:47.482]  You know you're manipulating people.
[00:47:47.482 --> 00:47:55.067]  You're trying to get blacks and whites and everybody else fighting with each other for your own political gain.
[00:47:55.067 --> 00:48:07.055]  You're cold-bloodedly hijacking this country and taking over every sector of the economy, and right out in the middle of nowhere, when no one's even thinking or talking about race, you come right into the middle of the situation and
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.981]  Drop it in the middle of the party.
[00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:14.424]  Drop a stink bomb right in the middle of the party.
[00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:16.085]  And say, oh, you don't like black people.
[00:48:16.085 --> 00:48:17.767]  You don't like Hispanics.
[00:48:17.767 --> 00:48:19.408]  To get everyone at each other's throats.
[00:48:19.408 --> 00:48:21.971]  And that's what the ADL does.
[00:48:21.971 --> 00:48:23.372]  I mean, I don't like Michelle Malkin.
[00:48:23.372 --> 00:48:26.315]  She's a worshipper of torture and war and corruption.
[00:48:26.315 --> 00:48:28.337]  And, by the way, of Israel.
[00:48:28.337 --> 00:48:29.458]  Not good enough.
[00:48:29.458 --> 00:48:30.699]  She's against socialism.
[00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:32.020]  And the elites want that.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.862]  So she's demonized right alongside me.
[00:48:36.204 --> 00:48:38.625]  Lou Dobbs talks about the North American Union.
[00:48:38.625 --> 00:48:40.146]  Run out of his job.
[00:48:40.146 --> 00:48:43.848]  He's demonized right next to me.
[00:48:43.848 --> 00:48:45.949]  But they say I'm the chief enemy.
[00:48:45.949 --> 00:48:46.389]  And why?
[00:48:46.389 --> 00:48:52.692]  Because I understand the game and I'm teaching people the game and showing them how these people are operating.
[00:48:52.692 --> 00:48:59.255]  And so Hitler was certainly bad and did kill a lot of people and was a bad guy.
[00:48:59.255 --> 00:49:03.017]  And so here I am, the grandson of
[00:49:03.826 --> 00:49:10.769]  Two men who were in World War II, volunteered for their country, and I get to be lumped in.
[00:49:10.769 --> 00:49:12.310]  I'm now Hitler, see?
[00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:19.173]  They get to move that black spot in European history and over and put it on Alex Jones, who has nothing to do with it.
[00:49:19.173 --> 00:49:22.474]  And just say, oh, we're the ADL, we fight Nazis.
[00:49:22.474 --> 00:49:25.015]  Look, Alex Jones doesn't like socialism.
[00:49:25.015 --> 00:49:26.196]  They say that in these articles.
[00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:29.551]  They say that in CBS, they say it in the Jerusalem Post.
[00:49:29.551 --> 00:49:36.576]  If you don't like big government, you are a Nazi and you're dangerous and you want violence.
[00:49:36.576 --> 00:49:53.208]  Does it matter that nine times out of ten when a synagogue or a dormitory or an NAACP gets a swastika spray-painted on it, people, the police end up locally, because the police are getting wise, shutting up hidden cameras and catching the local black or Jewish students out there doing it.
[00:49:54.304 --> 00:49:55.585]  Game over, folks.
[00:49:55.585 --> 00:49:56.526]  You understand?
[00:49:56.526 --> 00:49:59.028]  It's now come out in the Miami Papers.
[00:49:59.028 --> 00:50:01.170]  It's now come out in the Boston Globe.
[00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.331]  Over and over again, top Nazis.
[00:50:03.331 --> 00:50:04.372]  Hal Turner.
[00:50:04.372 --> 00:50:06.174]  Top Nazi rallies in Florida.
[00:50:06.174 --> 00:50:06.534]  Everywhere.
[00:50:06.534 --> 00:50:07.935]  They're always feds.
[00:50:07.935 --> 00:50:09.136]  They're run by feds.
[00:50:09.136 --> 00:50:11.418]  And those are the groups all attacking Alex Jones.
[00:50:11.418 --> 00:50:12.158]  People aren't stupid.
[00:50:12.158 --> 00:50:12.879]  They're going away.
[00:50:12.879 --> 00:50:14.740]  The Nazis all hate Alex Jones.
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:16.382]  I mean, they spend literally on the web.
[00:50:16.382 --> 00:50:20.345]  I'm probably the number one person attacked by Nazis.
[00:50:20.345 --> 00:50:21.225]  They're not really Nazis.
[00:50:21.225 --> 00:50:21.666]  They're feds.
[00:50:22.423 --> 00:50:28.907]  They sick the mindless idiot followers, their bigoted followers, on us.
[00:50:28.907 --> 00:50:36.052]  Separately, I have the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center now saying I'm the number one threat.
[00:50:36.052 --> 00:50:39.514]  You understand now?
[00:50:39.514 --> 00:50:47.940]  And so, by trying to say someone's an anti-Semite, and they don't say that about me, they just mix me in with them,
[00:50:48.624 --> 00:50:54.367]  But by doing that, they hope to demonize anyone being politically involved, lest you be singled out by the ADL.
[00:50:54.367 --> 00:50:58.949]  It's an attempt to chill your free speech and shut you up so you'll accept the bondage.
[00:51:00.813 --> 00:51:01.474]  Hello.
[00:51:01.474 --> 00:51:06.219]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:51:06.219 --> 00:51:11.043]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:51:11.043 --> 00:51:16.108]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:51:16.108 --> 00:51:20.793]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[00:51:20.793 --> 00:51:24.877]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[00:51:24.977 --> 00:51:29.339]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[00:51:29.339 --> 00:51:33.901]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[00:51:33.901 --> 00:51:36.081]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[00:51:36.081 --> 00:51:38.142]  I can't say enough about this book.
[00:51:38.142 --> 00:51:40.063]  Blessings to you and your family.
[00:51:40.063 --> 00:51:45.765]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[00:51:45.765 --> 00:51:49.187]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:51:49.187 --> 00:51:51.848]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:51:52.768 --> 00:51:54.849]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:54.849 --> 00:51:57.211]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:57.211 --> 00:51:58.331]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.002]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.002 --> 00:52:20.408]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.408 --> 00:52:25.432]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.432 --> 00:52:35.580]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.042]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.042 --> 00:52:39.624]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.624 --> 00:52:42.086]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.086 --> 00:52:44.229]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.229 --> 00:52:49.374]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.374 --> 00:52:54.379]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:54.379 --> 00:52:58.483]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:01.767 --> 00:53:11.677]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries?
[00:53:11.677 --> 00:53:13.719]  If so, you are not alone.
[00:53:13.719 --> 00:53:16.942]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems.
[00:53:17.182 --> 00:53:17.682]  We're good to go.
[00:53:40.629 --> 00:53:41.390]  We're good to go.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:20.215]  As bad as this is on the surface, to have Chris Matthews coming out and saying, if you criticize Obama in any way, you are a cross-burning Klansman.
[00:54:20.215 --> 00:54:25.622]  As bad as it is to have the ADL blowing the trumpet and saying Alex Jones is enemy number one.
[00:54:28.524 --> 00:54:32.807]  As bad as that is, it shows that the establishment is getting scared.
[00:54:32.807 --> 00:54:38.872]  And they admit in these articles that we're reaching tens of millions of people, that we are incredibly popular.
[00:54:38.872 --> 00:54:42.455]  That's a quote.
[00:54:42.455 --> 00:54:44.356]  And that we're growing.
[00:54:44.356 --> 00:54:46.478]  See, I can look at our own growth curve internally.
[00:54:47.631 --> 00:54:53.055]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can get off airplanes in Canada, in England, in Central America, anywhere in the U.S.
[00:54:53.055 --> 00:54:53.295]  now.
[00:54:53.295 --> 00:54:59.019]  I can walk down any main street and cars start stopping and people getting out and going, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, I'm a listener.
[00:54:59.019 --> 00:55:00.820]  I mean, we are huge.
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:02.461]  Huge!
[00:55:02.461 --> 00:55:04.802]  And it's been completely underground.
[00:55:04.802 --> 00:55:08.045]  And they've tried to ignore us, like Gandhi said.
[00:55:08.045 --> 00:55:11.427]  First they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win.
[00:55:12.461 --> 00:55:17.623]  They have been trying to ignore us, hoping it would go away, and now they're saying, okay, this guy's dangerous.
[00:55:17.623 --> 00:55:19.464]  No, I'm not dangerous.
[00:55:19.464 --> 00:55:23.745]  I'm not the one putting poisons in the water supply mainstream news admits.
[00:55:23.745 --> 00:55:25.085]  Okay, it's admitted it's in there.
[00:55:25.085 --> 00:55:26.946]  I'm not the one feeding people GMO food.
[00:55:26.946 --> 00:55:32.168]  I'm not the one telling the public there's no mercury in the vaccines when you read the insert and it's in there.
[00:55:32.168 --> 00:55:34.329]  I'm just pointing out all the lies.
[00:55:34.329 --> 00:55:37.490]  The people have found out that the media and the government are a bunch of liars.
[00:55:40.151 --> 00:55:42.272]  And so, hey, ADL, great.
[00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:45.653]  Write more articles saying I'm making up that there's a world government.
[00:55:45.653 --> 00:55:51.395]  And they try little tricks in there like, Jones says a lot of different groups, he doesn't know which one's running.
[00:55:51.395 --> 00:55:57.837]  One day it's the Bilderberg Group, next it's the Trilateral Commission, next it's the CFR, next it's the Federal Reserve.
[00:55:57.837 --> 00:56:01.919]  Who runs the Bilderberg Group, CFR, Trilateral Commission, Federal Reserve Bank?
[00:56:02.585 --> 00:56:04.026]  It's like six guys.
[00:56:04.026 --> 00:56:05.527]  They're the heads of all those groups.
[00:56:05.527 --> 00:56:08.308]  Those are different management arms in a corporate structure.
[00:56:08.308 --> 00:56:16.733]  They write textbooks, the government does, bragging about it, so their high-level government executives and technicians can understand what's going on.
[00:56:16.733 --> 00:56:26.138]  I mean, do you understand that you can't continue to just say none of this exists?
[00:56:26.138 --> 00:56:27.238]  And they're not stupid.
[00:56:27.238 --> 00:56:30.540]  They're trying to create a chilling effect, saying it doesn't matter if it exists.
[00:56:31.306 --> 00:56:34.870]  You only say it exists, Jones, if it's good.
[00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:38.575]  You don't come out and say it's bad, or we're gonna come after you.
[00:56:38.575 --> 00:56:39.836]  Do you understand?
[00:56:39.836 --> 00:56:47.285]  You, as an American citizen, are not allowed to speak out against the Ken Lay, Bernard Madoff types.
[00:56:49.485 --> 00:56:53.887]  Because those guys are pulled from the highest ranks of the very same crew running things.
[00:56:53.887 --> 00:56:55.328]  They're all a bunch of crooks.
[00:56:55.328 --> 00:56:56.909]  Goldman Sachs, all of it.
[00:56:56.909 --> 00:57:02.832]  And the reason they're really scared of me is because I'm going after the Federal Reserve and I'm pointing out, bypass the Democrats, bypass the Republicans.
[00:57:02.832 --> 00:57:04.653]  This is the key.
[00:57:04.653 --> 00:57:07.674]  We are bringing people unity.
[00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:12.997]  We are telling you whether you're black, white, Hispanic, old, young, the New World Order,
[00:57:13.971 --> 00:57:24.114]  wants you to be disenfranchised and dependent on them and institutionalized and they want you to be totally controlled.
[00:57:24.114 --> 00:57:32.396]  We read the UN documents on air where they openly state they want to lower our standard of living to control us.
[00:57:32.396 --> 00:57:41.319]  And so we're here pointing that out, bringing people together under principles of liberty and freedom and true free market and the system doesn't want that.
[00:57:43.234 --> 00:57:49.655]  And so their job is to make all political discourse about race and religion to get us all fighting with each other.
[00:57:49.655 --> 00:57:51.135]  They are the purveyors.
[00:57:51.135 --> 00:58:01.517]  And just like Chris Matthews wants to keep black people as the property of the Democratic Party by invoking race and telling them racists are everywhere that want to get them.
[00:58:01.517 --> 00:58:08.719]  If you say the word socialism, that that's code for wanting to burn or shoot or lynch black people.
[00:58:08.719 --> 00:58:10.019]  The ADL wants to keep
[00:58:10.678 --> 00:58:12.178]  Jews on the reservation.
[00:58:12.178 --> 00:58:13.679]  They want to keep Jews scared.
[00:58:13.679 --> 00:58:16.340]  Jews thinking everyone's after them.
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:22.141]  They want to make it where when Jews hear on the radio, New World Order, oh, that's code for me.
[00:58:22.141 --> 00:58:27.443]  See, they're always inserting the word Jew into these debates.
[00:58:27.443 --> 00:58:30.503]  You know, the word black into the debates.
[00:58:30.503 --> 00:58:31.664]  This is race baiting.
[00:58:31.664 --> 00:58:32.924]  This is religion baiting.
[00:58:32.924 --> 00:58:35.165]  This is how the great game is played.
[00:58:35.165 --> 00:58:37.565]  This is how we are controlled.
[00:58:37.565 --> 00:58:38.546]  I'll finish up with this topic.
[00:58:38.546 --> 00:58:39.666]  I'm going to go to Dr. Fortman Roberts.
[00:58:40.998 --> 00:58:45.755]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:50.528 --> 00:58:58.296]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:58:58.296 --> 00:59:04.361]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:59:04.361 --> 00:59:07.324]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:59:07.324 --> 00:59:13.230]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:15.171]  This book will work for anyone.
[00:59:15.171 --> 00:59:17.652]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:59:17.652 --> 00:59:23.275]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:59:23.275 --> 00:59:25.356]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:59:25.356 --> 00:59:27.117]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:59:27.117 --> 00:59:29.638]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:59:29.638 --> 00:59:34.381]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:59:34.381 --> 00:59:38.082]  Go to hereiswhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:59:38.082 --> 00:59:40.224]  Again, it is hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:59:41.204 --> 00:59:43.086]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:59:43.086 --> 00:59:44.127]  One last time.
[00:59:44.127 --> 00:59:53.655]  It's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:59:53.655 --> 00:59:56.037]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.037 --> 01:00:01.842]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:01.842 --> 01:00:02.883]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.379 --> 01:00:23.824]  Another disgusting thing about the ADL, CBS News, Jerusalem Post, all these other publications that have really run up the flag, run up the message that I'm the top enemy to be dealt with,
[01:00:36.775 --> 01:00:54.850]  To be silenced, is that you have these organizations, these media outlets, these intelligence outlets, telling everyone they're the boss, they're the judge, they'll tell you what you can listen to, they'll tell you what's extreme and what isn't.
[01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:59.854]  And then now they're telling you, you don't call socialism socialism, or you're a racist, you want to murder Jews.
[01:01:01.647 --> 01:01:03.669]  Oh, you don't want the carbon treaty.
[01:01:03.669 --> 01:01:04.890]  You hate Jews.
[01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:05.911]  You're like, what's this?
[01:01:05.911 --> 01:01:08.053]  Why do you keep bringing Jews up?
[01:01:08.053 --> 01:01:09.294]  Don't you see?
[01:01:09.294 --> 01:01:15.418]  The accusers are the people that are invoking all of this so they get power and control.
[01:01:15.418 --> 01:01:22.364]  They create the crisis or add gasoline to it, and then they pose as the savior.
[01:01:22.364 --> 01:01:28.489]  The ADL wrote the Homeland Security documents that say veterans and gun owners and conservatives are the number one threat.
[01:01:29.665 --> 01:01:34.327]  Libertarians, Ron Paul, myself and many others.
[01:01:34.327 --> 01:01:39.528]  America Freedom to Fascism, by the way, we sell in the DVD shop at Infowars.com.
[01:01:39.528 --> 01:01:42.950]  Made by a Jew!
[01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:45.590]  Good friend of mine, Aaron Russo, a great guy.
[01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:49.872]  What, he isn't allowed to make a film about the IRS and the Federal Reserve?
[01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:52.933]  See, they don't want us coming together.
[01:01:52.933 --> 01:01:55.474]  They want us all fighting with each other.
[01:01:55.474 --> 01:01:59.075]  And I'm going to do some whole reports in the next few days, next few weeks,
[01:01:59.659 --> 01:02:02.000]  And I know Paul Watson's doing them the next few days.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.403]  We're going to do exposés of all the Nazi leaders that it's turned out, and Klan leaders that are feds.
[01:02:08.403 --> 01:02:11.284]  They're not infiltrating groups, they're starting them, they're running them.
[01:02:11.284 --> 01:02:13.826]  Hal Turner, all of them.
[01:02:13.826 --> 01:02:15.426]  And who do they go after?
[01:02:15.426 --> 01:02:17.187]  Alex Jones.
[01:02:17.187 --> 01:02:22.150]  They go after me more than they go after Benjamin Netanyahu.
[01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:27.152]  You'd think if they're such big anti-Semites, so anti-Israel, they would be going after
[01:02:29.218 --> 01:02:30.259]  Benjamin Netanyahu?
[01:02:30.259 --> 01:02:30.579]  No.
[01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:33.760]  They go after Alex Jones.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:42.245]  And we've caught a known Israeli operative, on record he admits he's funded by Israel, running around saying I'm some Catholic commander.
[01:02:42.245 --> 01:02:43.085]  I'm not even Catholic.
[01:02:43.085 --> 01:02:44.146]  I'm not bashing Catholics.
[01:02:44.146 --> 01:02:45.526]  The Catholics are great people.
[01:02:45.526 --> 01:02:46.947]  See, I'm not in the division.
[01:02:46.947 --> 01:02:48.528]  They've got that crew going after me.
[01:02:48.528 --> 01:02:55.111]  I mean, I've got a major intelligence operation being run, and I still don't sink down to their level.
[01:02:55.111 --> 01:02:56.612]  I still take the high road.
[01:02:58.453 --> 01:03:03.196]  And I think Jews are intelligent, hard-working, smart, funny, neat people.
[01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:09.319]  The Jews I've known in my life, people, some of the people I work with, like Rob Jacobson, who's Jewish.
[01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:13.121]  Rob always makes the joke, he goes, why don't they attack me, all these Nazi groups?
[01:03:13.121 --> 01:03:13.622]  I'm Jewish.
[01:03:13.622 --> 01:03:17.604]  You know, I mean, that's the whole issue is,
[01:03:18.644 --> 01:03:20.505]  But we do criticize Israel.
[01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:25.529]  We've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming on, who's not a hypocrite and tells the truth and breaks down what's happening.
[01:03:25.529 --> 01:03:30.652]  But we do it in a legitimate, real, effective way.
[01:03:30.652 --> 01:03:34.715]  And we don't just single Israel out as the only source of corruption on the planet.
[01:03:34.715 --> 01:03:36.196]  No, Iran's corrupt.
[01:03:36.196 --> 01:03:37.317]  And Pakistan's corrupt.
[01:03:37.317 --> 01:03:38.297]  And Japan's corrupt.
[01:03:38.297 --> 01:03:39.218]  And Germany's corrupt.
[01:03:39.218 --> 01:03:40.479]  And England's corrupt.
[01:03:40.479 --> 01:03:42.761]  Mexico's corrupt.
[01:03:42.761 --> 01:03:44.162]  What does history show you?
[01:03:44.162 --> 01:03:45.743]  Governments tend to get corrupt.
[01:03:45.743 --> 01:03:47.744]  And once they get corrupt, they get more and more corrupt.
[01:03:48.482 --> 01:03:50.083]  They devolve.
[01:03:50.083 --> 01:03:52.105]  They degenerate.
[01:03:52.105 --> 01:03:53.526]  I want less corruption.
[01:03:53.526 --> 01:03:55.208]  I want private property rights.
[01:03:55.208 --> 01:03:57.890]  I want to live in freedom.
[01:03:57.890 --> 01:04:03.375]  I'm sick of the ADL and Chris Matthews and all these people invoking race.
[01:04:03.375 --> 01:04:04.796]  I want to live in peace with people.
[01:04:04.796 --> 01:04:15.005]  You know, I'm forced to talk about the illegal alien invasion because it's part of the global estate and plan to bankrupt the country, bankrupt the states, and break down the US sovereignty for North American Union.
[01:04:15.005 --> 01:04:16.506]  I'm not against the people of Mexico.
[01:04:17.492 --> 01:04:22.935]  But we can't take six billion third world people that want to come here.
[01:04:22.935 --> 01:04:26.838]  Not with the socialist system we've got if we had a free market, maybe.
[01:04:26.838 --> 01:04:33.422]  But you can't have a social welfare trough and then bring in three million new people a year.
[01:04:33.422 --> 01:04:34.262]  You can't do it.
[01:04:34.262 --> 01:04:37.765]  We're going bankrupt, which is what the big central banks want.
[01:04:37.765 --> 01:04:39.966]  Drive us all into debt that we owe to them.
[01:04:39.966 --> 01:04:41.227]  It's all fiat they make up.
[01:04:42.853 --> 01:04:46.377]  I'm gonna talk more about this in about 30 minutes before Dr. Paul Greg Roberts leaves us.
[01:04:46.377 --> 01:04:49.521]  Gold's gone up to $1,150 today.
[01:04:49.521 --> 01:04:51.223]  So much other news here.
[01:04:51.223 --> 01:04:53.046]  Very important broadcast.
[01:04:53.046 --> 01:04:55.489]  Katherine Austen Fitch used to head up HUD, coming on.
[01:04:55.489 --> 01:04:57.992]  George Humphrey in studio as well.
[01:04:57.992 --> 01:04:58.993]  Power packed.
[01:04:58.993 --> 01:04:59.654]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:05.731]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:05.731 --> 01:05:08.992]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:13.773]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:13.773 --> 01:05:20.174]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:20.174 --> 01:05:22.415]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:22.955 --> 01:05:23.255]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:23.255 --> 01:05:23.755]  Bernanke?
[01:05:23.755 --> 01:05:24.576]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:24.576 --> 01:05:25.716]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:25.716 --> 01:05:27.957]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:41.863 --> 01:05:49.132]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:49.132 --> 01:05:58.324]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:09.537]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:06:09.537 --> 01:06:12.898]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:06:12.898 --> 01:06:18.761]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:06:18.761 --> 01:06:23.543]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:06:23.543 --> 01:06:25.904]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:06:26.084 --> 01:06:26.484]  Thank you.
[01:06:44.991 --> 01:06:48.713]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:50.914]  That's O-X-Y Silver dot net.
[01:06:50.914 --> 01:06:55.896]  Or call about OxySilver, ZO Life, and GI Flora Pro, toll free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:06:55.896 --> 01:06:57.417]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:06:57.417 --> 01:06:57.897]  Do it now.
[01:07:01.001 --> 01:07:04.024]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:04.024 --> 01:07:09.349]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:11.411]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:11.411 --> 01:07:16.396]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:16.396 --> 01:07:17.317]  How much do you want?
[01:07:17.577 --> 01:07:18.698]  When do you want it?
[01:07:18.698 --> 01:07:20.579]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:21.659]  When will you need it?
[01:07:21.659 --> 01:07:23.860]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:25.201]  Will there be any food?
[01:07:25.201 --> 01:07:26.722]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:07:26.722 --> 01:07:32.005]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:07:32.005 --> 01:07:35.587]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:07:35.587 --> 01:07:39.049]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:40.610]  How much will you need?
[01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:41.530]  We don't know.
[01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:42.631]  How much do you want?
[01:07:42.631 --> 01:07:43.551]  All you can get.
[01:07:43.551 --> 01:07:44.652]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:44.652 --> 01:07:47.694]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:07:47.694 --> 01:07:49.475]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:49.475 --> 01:07:50.395]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:08:02.859 --> 01:08:09.502]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:22.987]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.987 --> 01:08:26.129]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our guest for the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:26.129 --> 01:08:31.211]  I'm going to continue getting into the economy, a bunch of other news I haven't even covered yet.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:46.973]  Uh, and we're also, uh, going to get back, of course, into all these hit pieces, uh, where they're openly saying I'm gonna cause a violent revolution and I'm dangerous, when we're not even calling for a violent revolution.
[01:08:46.973 --> 01:08:48.254]  So it's pretty spooky.
[01:08:48.254 --> 01:08:49.555]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts...
[01:08:50.985 --> 01:09:06.256]  Uh, is the John M. Olin Fellow at the Institute for Political Economy, Senior Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University and Research Fellow at the Independent Institute, a former editor and columnist for the Wall Street Journal, and a columnist for Businessweek and Scripps Tower News Service.
[01:09:06.256 --> 01:09:12.661]  He is a nationally syndicated columnist for Creator Syndicate in Los Angeles and a columnist for, uh, Investors Business Daily.
[01:09:13.553 --> 01:09:17.276]  And in 92, he received the Warren Brooks Award for Excellence in Journalism.
[01:09:17.276 --> 01:09:23.061]  In 93, the Forbes Media Guide ranked him one of the top seven journalists in the world.
[01:09:23.061 --> 01:09:25.562]  He was a Distinguished Fellow at the Cato Institute.
[01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:31.707]  And of course, he also serves as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy under Ronald Reagan.
[01:09:31.707 --> 01:09:36.931]  The Treasury Department, he's known as the father of Reaganomics and the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.
[01:09:38.582 --> 01:09:46.747]  And he was awarded the Treasury Department's Meritorious Service Award for his outstanding contributions to the formulation of United States economic policy.
[01:09:46.747 --> 01:09:47.727]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:09:47.727 --> 01:09:57.532]  He served the Congressional staff in the late 70s with Kemp Rothbill and played a leading role in developing bipartisan support for supply-side economic policy.
[01:09:57.532 --> 01:10:00.034]  And we've just got him for two segments here today.
[01:10:00.034 --> 01:10:02.015]  We're very honored to have him.
[01:10:02.015 --> 01:10:03.636]  And I just wanted to get into
[01:10:04.494 --> 01:10:08.677]  The drumbeat getting much faster and much louder to abandon the dollar.
[01:10:08.677 --> 01:10:11.679]  IMF head says global currency change needed.
[01:10:11.679 --> 01:10:12.920]  Presses to move to the yen.
[01:10:13.781 --> 01:10:17.083]  The yawn as the world reserve currency.
[01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:18.624]  That's out of Reuters.
[01:10:18.624 --> 01:10:24.186]  We've got open announcements of this happening, but Bernanke says he's not too worried about it.
[01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:26.768]  What will it mean if they continue to devalue the dollar?
[01:10:26.768 --> 01:10:28.228]  It's at a 15-month low.
[01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:31.910]  Right now, gold went up to $1,150 an ounce today.
[01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:35.672]  In futures, it's trading even higher with no end in sight.
[01:10:35.672 --> 01:10:40.594]  And now the mainstream media admits gold is going up because the dollar is being devalued amongst other things.
[01:10:40.594 --> 01:10:41.495]  So, top economist,
[01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:42.475]  Yes it is, isn't it?
[01:11:08.208 --> 01:11:23.998]  What made the whole world realize that the dollar was in its death throes is that both the budget deficit and the trade deficit are so large they cannot be closed by conventional means.
[01:11:23.998 --> 01:11:37.627]  And since there's no possibility of closing the budget or trade deficit, the rest of the world sees that to continue to rely on the dollar
[01:11:38.465 --> 01:11:46.849]  As reserve currency, which means, of course, it has to be a store of value.
[01:11:46.849 --> 01:12:01.316]  If it's not a store of value, you don't want, in your country, running a central bank, you don't want your reserves of your nation stored in something that's not a store of value.
[01:12:01.316 --> 01:12:07.419]  And since the dollar is losing value, and since the rest of the world doesn't see any way
[01:12:08.516 --> 01:12:09.816]  We're good to go.
[01:12:37.029 --> 01:12:38.350]  Everyone is talking about it.
[01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:40.051]  They're trying to get attention.
[01:12:40.051 --> 01:12:44.115]  They're trying to figure out what to do.
[01:12:44.115 --> 01:12:51.260]  And I don't know what the solution will be.
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:54.202]  It may be that there won't be a reserve currency.
[01:12:54.202 --> 01:13:01.028]  That countries with strong currencies will settle with each other in their own currency.
[01:13:01.028 --> 01:13:06.672]  It may take some time for a new system to arrive.
[01:13:08.519 --> 01:13:21.925]  John Maynard Keynes, at the end of World War II, he had a proposal which did not require a reserve currency.
[01:13:21.925 --> 01:13:29.549]  If you ran a surplus, you had to take offsetting actions to get rid of it.
[01:13:29.549 --> 01:13:33.470]  If you ran a deficit, you had to take offsetting actions.
[01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:36.412]  Otherwise, you were subject to fines.
[01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:37.352]  I don't know whether they'll
[01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:43.033]  Bring something like that into play or not.
[01:13:43.033 --> 01:13:59.523]  But the dollar is certainly losing its value despite the fact that most other countries are intervening to support the dollar because they don't want their currency to rise so much.
[01:13:59.523 --> 01:14:02.385]  The Swiss go in and buy a dollar.
[01:14:02.385 --> 01:14:04.046]  The Chinese buy a dollar.
[01:14:04.046 --> 01:14:06.507]  The Japanese buy a dollar.
[01:14:06.507 --> 01:14:07.488]  All of these countries
[01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:16.512]  Are supporting the dollar by spending their own currency to buy it, and it's still falling.
[01:14:16.512 --> 01:14:23.498]  So this tells you that it's a bad situation for the dollar.
[01:14:23.498 --> 01:14:24.880]  Now, one other thing, Alex.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:33.688]  Here, in the short run, the dollar could go back up because the low interest rate in the United States means
[01:14:34.304 --> 01:14:43.627]  That the dollar is being used for the carry trade, like the Japanese yen was the last few years.
[01:14:43.627 --> 01:14:55.550]  You can borrow in the United States at such a low rate, and then you take that money and you invest it in a higher-yielding foreign asset.
[01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:57.771]  And so they're getting another bubble going.
[01:14:57.771 --> 01:14:58.791]  On that bubble burst,
[01:14:59.622 --> 01:15:07.626]  Everybody has to unwind the carry trade, which means they have to demand dollars to pay back the dollar loans.
[01:15:07.626 --> 01:15:21.191]  So, we could have a blip-up in the dollar when the current stock market bubble bursts, and they have to unwind the carry trade.
[01:15:21.191 --> 01:15:25.153]  But the downward trend is in place.
[01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:28.295]  There's really nothing to reverse it.
[01:15:28.295 --> 01:15:29.095]  If you think about
[01:15:29.645 --> 01:15:35.308]  The deficit this year is four times larger than last year.
[01:15:35.308 --> 01:15:42.993]  The deficit for fiscal year 2010 is also supposed to be four times larger than 2008.
[01:15:42.993 --> 01:15:54.360]  These are massive sums that have to be financed, and the budget deficit greatly exceeds
[01:15:55.478 --> 01:15:58.679]  The trade surpluses of our so-called trading partners.
[01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:08.001]  So even if they recycle all the dollars they earn from their trade surpluses, it still doesn't cover our budget deficit.
[01:16:08.001 --> 01:16:19.164]  And so the likelihood is that they'll have to print money, or print more money, which will tend to send the dollar yet lower.
[01:16:19.164 --> 01:16:24.445]  So there you have a very disturbing picture that doesn't
[01:16:25.705 --> 01:16:29.568]  And that's my next question.
[01:16:29.568 --> 01:16:34.131]  Again, just in layman's terms, there is a method to the madness.
[01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:40.095]  I mean, I know for you, an economist who used to run the Treasury Department, it's hard to reconcile people this destructive.
[01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:41.876]  But it's even come out that Goldman Sachs
[01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:50.689]  Was telling people buy housing when they were actually secretly betting against it and that they were doing this to destroy their competition to make giant profits.
[01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:55.491]  So for this inner group, they're making record profits and consolidating the economy.
[01:16:55.491 --> 01:16:56.772]  Main Street is dying.
[01:16:56.772 --> 01:17:01.615]  Real inflation is in check to some point.
[01:17:01.615 --> 01:17:03.196]  I want to ask you how long that will last.
[01:17:03.196 --> 01:17:08.779]  But real unemployment, most of the indexes show above 20, not 10, like they're saying.
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:26.661]  And so how long can this delusional statement of jobless recovery continue as the real economy dies and as the bankers, the inner group, roll around in buckets of gold and palaces of wealth?
[01:17:29.643 --> 01:17:34.727]  I mean, they obviously know what they're doing because they're making all the big profits out of this.
[01:17:34.727 --> 01:17:41.171]  And meanwhile, I have stacks of mainstream news where suddenly mainline armies is being deployed in the streets of America.
[01:17:41.171 --> 01:17:42.011]  That's coming up later.
[01:17:42.011 --> 01:17:46.074]  I mean, the picture I'm trying to paint here is what I see.
[01:17:46.074 --> 01:17:48.676]  It's just, it's so diabolical.
[01:17:48.676 --> 01:17:54.780]  Or are you just saying they're so greedy and corrupt, they're just like pirates snatching goods out of the burning ship?
[01:17:57.372 --> 01:18:01.636]  You know, I'm not even sure they're smart enough to know it's burning.
[01:18:01.636 --> 01:18:17.048]  I certainly agree with you that Goldman Sachs and the investment banks are putting their short-term profits above everything else, and they're ruining their own future.
[01:18:17.048 --> 01:18:26.615]  Because, you know, once the dollar is not the reserve currency, a Wall Street investment bank doesn't have anything like the power or influence that it
[01:18:27.509 --> 01:18:29.590]  That it has had.
[01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:45.482]  So by focusing on their short-term profits, and it is a form of plunder and looting, because the profits are coming at the expense of other people.
[01:18:45.482 --> 01:18:50.925]  It's not a win-win trading situation.
[01:18:50.925 --> 01:18:54.248]  So the fact that they're so short-term in their outlook,
[01:18:56.749 --> 01:19:09.575]  It means they're contributing to the decline that we've been talking about, and so they're going to end up going down, too.
[01:19:09.575 --> 01:19:25.342]  And they're also losing their credibility and the trust of financial institutions in other countries, which will make it harder and harder for them to
[01:19:30.581 --> 01:19:36.583]  I don't know if they actually have a plot or a plan.
[01:19:36.583 --> 01:19:40.124]  I think they're just scramming.
[01:19:40.124 --> 01:19:49.847]  And they've been doing this since Clinton when they started getting the regulations against high debt leverage repealed.
[01:19:49.847 --> 01:19:51.107]  Alright, Doctor, stay there.
[01:19:51.107 --> 01:19:55.809]  We're going to come back and I've got a few other questions along this line because it's obviously so important.
[01:19:56.861 --> 01:20:00.903]  And I'm going to try to get a time frame from you on how you think this is going to break down.
[01:20:00.903 --> 01:20:08.407]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.

[01:21:00.802 --> 01:21:07.769]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:21:07.769 --> 01:21:10.612]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:21:10.612 --> 01:21:15.257]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.

[01:21:42.418 --> 01:21:42.719]  We're good.
[01:22:01.055 --> 01:22:02.116]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:02.116 --> 01:22:07.078]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:22:07.078 --> 01:22:15.143]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:22:15.143 --> 01:22:20.726]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:22:20.726 --> 01:22:27.690]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:33.597]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:22:33.597 --> 01:22:38.664]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:22:38.664 --> 01:22:46.254]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:53.164]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:22:53.164 --> 01:22:54.426]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:54.426 --> 01:22:54.626]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:12.193]  Dr. Roberts is going to be with us until about 40 after, so this segment is part of the next.
[01:24:12.193 --> 01:24:15.855]  Always informative to have him on.
[01:24:15.855 --> 01:24:20.638]  Dr. Roberts, I want to get back into the dollar and gold and where you see all this going.
[01:24:20.638 --> 01:24:22.319]  As you said on the show three years ago,
[01:24:23.419 --> 01:24:27.843]  That within five years of this continued, we could lose the dollar.
[01:24:27.843 --> 01:24:30.825]  And you said a year ago, in two years it could happen.
[01:24:30.825 --> 01:24:36.029]  So I want to get your revised breakdown on that and then how this could unravel, what this means.
[01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:42.294]  The average person's saying, well, the average Joe's going, well, how does that hurt me having a weak dollar?
[01:24:42.294 --> 01:24:51.621]  But separately, Obama, I mean, you were such a critic of Bush because of his just outrageous attacks on the Bill of Rights and Constitution and tripling size of government and the rest of it.
[01:24:52.253 --> 01:24:53.974]  Well, you know, Alex, nothing has changed.
[01:24:53.974 --> 01:24:55.734]  He hasn't repealed the police state measures.
[01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:24.632]  He hasn't, you know, he's escalated the war in Afghanistan.
[01:25:24.632 --> 01:25:28.174]  He started anew in Pakistan.
[01:25:28.174 --> 01:25:38.838]  The one good thing, possibly, is he's going to put some of those Guantanamo prisoners on trial in the United States.
[01:25:38.838 --> 01:25:47.061]  And this gives a chance for the lawyers for those prisoners to bring the real evidence out, which
[01:25:47.791 --> 01:25:55.292]  Which, if they succeed and are permitted by the trial judges, could greatly embarrass the United States.
[01:25:55.292 --> 01:26:00.233]  And so you could say that this is, you could interpret it.
[01:26:00.233 --> 01:26:02.354]  I don't know how to interpret it.
[01:26:02.354 --> 01:26:14.336]  Obama is trying to change things by putting a public trial out and it may show
[01:26:15.174 --> 01:26:19.815]  That the Bush actions were really inexcusable and illegal.
[01:26:19.815 --> 01:26:31.239]  So, you could look at that in a positive way, but I can't think of anything else about the administration that you could see in a positive way.
[01:26:31.239 --> 01:26:41.802]  He's certainly not ended wars, though he seems to be dragging his feet about further escalation in Afghanistan.
[01:26:41.802 --> 01:26:44.783]  Now, what everyone has to understand is the President really hasn't
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:54.947]  I don't think we've got much power anymore because the organized lobbies are more powerful than the government.
[01:26:54.947 --> 01:27:00.852]  The financial lobby, Goldman Sachs, I mean, they are the Treasury, the Federal Reserve.
[01:27:00.852 --> 01:27:02.453]  In other words, they are the government.
[01:27:02.453 --> 01:27:03.654]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:27:03.654 --> 01:27:11.700]  It's an independent private lobby that's controlling two of the most important parts of the government.
[01:27:12.409 --> 01:27:16.411]  The investment bankers control the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
[01:27:16.411 --> 01:27:21.875]  And then you have another very powerful lobby, the military security lobby.
[01:27:21.875 --> 01:27:24.876]  And they control the Pentagon and the State Department.
[01:27:24.876 --> 01:27:28.459]  And they want war because it makes money for them.
[01:27:28.459 --> 01:27:36.703]  The security aspects, like all the police state measures, because they get more power, they're less accountable.
[01:27:36.703 --> 01:27:38.564]  And then, of course, we have AIPAC.
[01:27:38.564 --> 01:27:39.305]  Everyone knows.
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:51.624]  The strength of the American-Israeli, what do they call it, American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee.
[01:27:51.624 --> 01:28:04.388]  That is another extremely powerful lobby, and of course they want to keep the American troops in the Middle East beating down
[01:28:06.753 --> 01:28:11.094]  Opposition to Israeli territorial expansion.
[01:28:11.094 --> 01:28:17.716]  So, if you look at those three lobbies, and you're a mere president, what are you going to do?
[01:28:17.716 --> 01:28:19.076]  What can you do?
[01:28:19.076 --> 01:28:20.796]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:22.817]  You're completely boxed in.
[01:28:22.817 --> 01:28:34.880]  Unless you're extremely clever and can find some way to expose them without them knowing that's what you're doing.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.220]  I just don't think the president
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:47.242]  Well, that's not going to happen because those three lobbies and several others, the big lawyer lobby as well, they put Obama in.
[01:28:47.242 --> 01:28:49.303]  And so he's going to continue and expand the wars.
[01:28:49.303 --> 01:28:54.665]  He's going to continue letting Goldman Sachs loot the nation.
[01:28:54.665 --> 01:28:57.546]  They're in control of the system.
[01:28:57.546 --> 01:28:58.926]  And he's one of their creatures.
[01:28:58.926 --> 01:28:59.466]  And I agree.
[01:28:59.466 --> 01:29:02.427]  He's a teleprompter reading front man, just like Bush.
[01:29:02.427 --> 01:29:04.248]  He's just better at it and better looking than Bush.
[01:29:05.661 --> 01:29:11.883]  My whole issue is they bring him in, they build him up to mythic proportions, now they're tearing him down.
[01:29:11.883 --> 01:29:19.326]  That way in three years to seven years when he's gone, everybody blames it on Obama instead of blaming it on the real power structure.
[01:29:19.326 --> 01:29:23.627]  That's why I think Goldman Sachs is so arrogant and they've got Northcom in place.
[01:29:23.627 --> 01:29:33.111]  We're going to come back and talk about the police state some and more on the economy, where Dr. Paul Craig Roberts thinks this economy is headed.
[01:29:33.111 --> 01:29:34.091]  Not what he would do.
[01:29:35.462 --> 01:29:51.154]  Not, not, not what he hopes would happen, but with the current management and all the statements they've made of the policies that they've got in place and they're saying they're going to continue, what his best dead reckoning timeline is on the death of the dollar and what that will mean to you.
[01:29:51.154 --> 01:29:55.078]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.078 --> 01:29:57.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:05.447]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:05.447 --> 01:32:09.973]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:09.973 --> 01:32:12.256]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:12.256 --> 01:32:13.878]  You don't have to cooperate.

[01:33:08.132 --> 01:33:09.113]  Welcome back!
[01:33:09.113 --> 01:33:11.354]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our guest.
[01:33:11.354 --> 01:33:15.116]  Another economist, George Humphrey, in studio next hour.
[01:33:15.116 --> 01:33:18.198]  Catherine Austin Fitz, who worked at HUD.
[01:33:18.198 --> 01:33:23.020]  Second in command over there, Dr. George Herbert Wagerbush, he's going to be joining us.
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:33.026]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former editor at the Wall Street Journal, former number two man at the Treasury, father of Reaganomics, is our guest.
[01:33:33.026 --> 01:33:35.187]  I just want to throw this out there.
[01:33:35.187 --> 01:33:36.708]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's our job
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:57.311]  It's our job to reach out and to educate people because as this tyranny unfolds, if we don't speak out against it, if we don't educate people, if we don't expose this system, then we're going to be in a vacuum here and not be able to
[01:33:58.516 --> 01:34:00.237]  Yes, there's a new edition out, a new printing.
[01:34:28.983 --> 01:34:36.925]  And there's another book coming out, I think, within a month called How the Economy Was Lost.
[01:34:36.925 --> 01:34:46.068]  It explains the whole loss of the American economy and Counterpunch is sponsoring this.
[01:34:46.068 --> 01:34:48.129]  It'll be out, I think, within a month.
[01:34:48.129 --> 01:34:51.029]  I think it's already advertised on Amazon.
[01:34:51.029 --> 01:34:52.730]  Sir, how important is it
[01:34:54.406 --> 01:35:05.169]  That we bear testament, bear witness to who's really done this because the establishment obviously controls the mainstream media, owns it lock, stock and barrel.
[01:35:05.169 --> 01:35:15.471]  The White House admits they're engaging in billions of dollars of fake news purchasing, propagandizing and planted in mainline TV fiction shows, not just news.
[01:35:15.471 --> 01:35:17.772]  How important is it that every American speak out?
[01:35:19.122 --> 01:35:25.944]  It's very important because if enough people could catch on, possibly something could be done.
[01:35:25.944 --> 01:35:29.245]  But it's so hard to wake people up.
[01:35:29.245 --> 01:35:32.386]  And they get so many conflicting explanations.
[01:35:32.386 --> 01:35:36.347]  They have their own biases and prejudices.
[01:35:36.347 --> 01:35:40.648]  And that's why it makes it easy for the bad guys to prevail.
[01:35:40.648 --> 01:35:45.849]  So I think the sort of thing you try to do is very important.
[01:35:45.849 --> 01:35:47.670]  People need to
[01:35:49.150 --> 01:35:51.011]  Catch on in time.
[01:36:10.026 --> 01:36:28.643]  I want to finish up with the economy and again where you see it going with the current management clearly not changing since Bush left the same same people under Clinton that got rid of the Glass-Steagall but but before we do that you talk to a lot of other economists and other authors and other researchers and a lot of other
[01:36:28.963 --> 01:36:30.103]  Well, most of them are in denial.
[01:36:30.103 --> 01:36:33.464]  They're in denial, and they don't understand the situation.
[01:36:33.464 --> 01:36:37.805]  Look, Alex, for all of this fiscal year that's just ended, the budget deficit was four times larger than
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:58.680]  Uh, 2008.
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:04.523]  So that's a massive fiscal stimulus in terms of conventional economic policy.
[01:37:04.523 --> 01:37:09.444]  In addition, we've had incredibly low interest rates.
[01:37:09.444 --> 01:37:14.706]  The Federal Reserve has created massive bank reserves.
[01:37:14.706 --> 01:37:19.088]  And yet, it's had no effect on lifting the economy.
[01:37:19.088 --> 01:37:20.008]  None.
[01:37:20.008 --> 01:37:25.150]  The unemployment rate rises, and as you've already made the point, it's measured
[01:37:26.085 --> 01:37:32.690]  If you measure the way it was measured when I was in the Treasury, it's over 20%.
[01:37:32.690 --> 01:37:44.097]  And so this massive conventional stimulus, both on monetary policy and fiscal policy, both of them the strongest problems we've ever had in our history.
[01:37:44.097 --> 01:37:46.919]  They've had no effect whatsoever in lifting the economy.
[01:37:48.334 --> 01:37:51.175]  Houses are still going into foreclosure.
[01:37:51.175 --> 01:37:58.077]  People are defaulting the real estate, the commercial real estate thing is beginning to hit.
[01:37:58.077 --> 01:38:01.258]  The dollar keeps sinking against every currency.
[01:38:01.258 --> 01:38:03.039]  You know, we even talked about this.
[01:38:03.039 --> 01:38:10.821]  It sinks against the Brazilian currency, against the Botswana currency.
[01:38:10.821 --> 01:38:15.403]  Wherever you look, there's this sign of decline, policy,
[01:38:16.504 --> 01:38:23.688]  The conventional policy they use, fiscal stimulus, monetary expansion, it has no effect.
[01:38:23.688 --> 01:38:25.189]  And yet, they're all in denial.
[01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:30.892]  They all think, oh, well, it'll all be different soon, that they even say we have a recovery.
[01:38:30.892 --> 01:38:41.058]  Look, in any recession, you always have an up quarter, because when the recession first hits, everybody stops producing because they don't know how bad it's going to be.
[01:38:41.058 --> 01:38:42.479]  So inventories get depleted.
[01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:50.522]  So then you have to produce something for the inventory, and you get an uplift, and that's all we've had.
[01:38:50.522 --> 01:38:52.244]  There's going to be another leg down.
[01:38:52.244 --> 01:38:54.585]  See, that's when you'll get worried.
[01:38:54.585 --> 01:39:05.454]  When the double dip arrives, then all the mainstream, conventional people in denial will start wondering, hey, what's going on?
[01:39:07.887 --> 01:39:12.028]  And until that happens, they simply don't have a clue.
[01:39:12.028 --> 01:39:14.288]  Paul Krugman hasn't got a clue.
[01:39:14.288 --> 01:39:16.549]  Bernanke hasn't got a clue.
[01:39:16.549 --> 01:39:24.351]  They just don't... What's happening is so different from what they've experienced in the past.
[01:39:24.351 --> 01:39:30.312]  And you called all of this years ago, so... And I understand you like to be precise about things, but...
[01:39:31.238 --> 01:39:50.765]  In your gut, when you're sitting around having dinner with your wife or family and thinking about your own future, thinking about your children and grandchildren's future, what does Dr. Paul Craig Roberts think that this country and this world is going to look like 12 months from now?
[01:39:50.765 --> 01:39:55.687]  I don't know whether it will be 12 months or 24 or 30.
[01:39:55.687 --> 01:40:00.409]  But when the dollar goes, we're not going to be able to pay for our imports.
[01:40:02.125 --> 01:40:10.550]  If you can't pay for your imports, we're two-thirds dependent on energy imports.
[01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:15.373]  So you have a lot of transportation disruptions.
[01:40:15.373 --> 01:40:20.836]  And disruptions of food delivery to grocery stores.
[01:40:20.836 --> 01:40:24.158]  And you don't know when there's any gasoline and when there isn't.
[01:40:24.158 --> 01:40:30.662]  And probably they'll have to kind of reserve the gasoline for the police forces.
[01:40:32.973 --> 01:40:40.397]  And when you go to Walmart, all the so-called cheap goods will be very expensive.
[01:40:40.397 --> 01:40:43.758]  So when it finally happens, it's going to be very bad.
[01:40:43.758 --> 01:40:50.342]  Now, it's entirely possible the rest of the world will prop this up longer.
[01:40:50.342 --> 01:40:52.943]  They may say, oh, we can't let this happen.
[01:40:52.943 --> 01:40:55.964]  The Americans have nuclear weapons.
[01:40:55.964 --> 01:40:56.965]  They're unstable.
[01:40:58.425 --> 01:40:59.706]  We've got to prop it up.
[01:40:59.706 --> 01:41:01.166]  And so, they may prop it.
[01:41:01.166 --> 01:41:04.287]  It may go on for five or six years.
[01:41:04.287 --> 01:41:07.588]  But it's something that they can't prop up forever.
[01:41:07.588 --> 01:41:09.129]  Even foreign countries.
[01:41:09.129 --> 01:41:12.710]  You know, the Chinese may say, let's keep buying their debt.
[01:41:12.710 --> 01:41:18.012]  Let's keep it going until we can figure out what to do.
[01:41:18.012 --> 01:41:26.075]  So, it could last even after it collapses just because the rest of the world is too
[01:41:27.902 --> 01:41:36.406]  Uncertain about what happens if we have to pay the consequences of our moronic policy.
[01:41:36.406 --> 01:41:51.973]  Well, Doctor, you are the economist, and again, listen, he's one of the top economists in the world, but just as a layman, it looks to me on Main Street like the collapse really happened last year, and they've just covered it up with the stimulus to a certain extent, but with unemployment,
[01:41:52.728 --> 01:41:56.289]  Over 20% in the real indexes with every economist we have on.
[01:41:56.289 --> 01:42:03.772]  I mean, if this isn't a collapse, I'm going to hate to see this collapse you were saying could come in a year, two years, three years, four years.
[01:42:03.772 --> 01:42:05.433]  Oh no, this is not the collapse.
[01:42:05.433 --> 01:42:08.274]  When the collapse comes, it's going to be much worse than anything.
[01:42:08.274 --> 01:42:13.316]  So you're talking about, I mean, that sounds road warrior-ish.
[01:42:13.316 --> 01:42:18.438]  Food shortages, water shortages, gas shortages, fuel shortages.
[01:42:18.438 --> 01:42:20.519]  And then that's my final point and question.
[01:42:21.673 --> 01:42:32.675]  I drove to our East Texas family farm to do some deer hunting with my children this weekend and I literally, no exaggeration, driving two and a half, three hours
[01:42:33.382 --> 01:42:36.083]  Probably saw 45 police cars.
[01:42:36.083 --> 01:42:42.564]  I would drive there 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago in college or high school.
[01:42:42.564 --> 01:42:43.985]  I might have seen three.
[01:42:43.985 --> 01:42:47.386]  I mean, it was so many police cars pulling people over.
[01:42:47.386 --> 01:42:52.847]  So much, and half the billboards on the roads I drove on, half of them were government.
[01:42:52.847 --> 01:42:57.728]  Tattle on your neighbor, tattle for child abuse, tattle for guns.
[01:42:57.728 --> 01:42:59.649]  I mean, I'm already living
[01:43:00.644 --> 01:43:09.851]  In a once free great nation, the last vestiges are being removed, and it's being replaced with science fiction tyranny.
[01:43:09.851 --> 01:43:10.371]  That's right.
[01:43:10.371 --> 01:43:17.397]  Well, Alex, at my gun club, when I go to the gun club, the police are there at 4.
[01:43:17.397 --> 01:43:19.818]  Every day, they get to use it.
[01:43:19.818 --> 01:43:21.780]  They've got automatic weapons.
[01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:24.902]  It sounds like a war going on.
[01:43:24.902 --> 01:43:25.803]  There'll be 25, 35, 40.
[01:43:30.273 --> 01:43:34.634]  The police officers there spearing out lead faster.
[01:43:34.634 --> 01:43:36.255]  It's unbelievable.
[01:43:36.255 --> 01:43:37.795]  And I asked, I said, what are you doing?
[01:43:37.795 --> 01:43:40.616]  You practicing for some kind of competition?
[01:43:40.616 --> 01:43:43.057]  And they said, no, we're practicing.
[01:43:43.057 --> 01:43:45.378]  I want to be sure my guys can win the shootout.
[01:43:45.378 --> 01:43:47.839]  And I said, shootout?
[01:43:47.839 --> 01:43:51.040]  And this was a very rich county.
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:52.820]  No crime, nothing.
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:55.481]  I said, shootout?
[01:43:55.481 --> 01:43:57.442]  With who?
[01:43:57.442 --> 01:43:58.362]  And they just looked at me.
[01:43:59.145 --> 01:44:01.726]  Yeah, it's in the shootouts with you.
[01:44:01.726 --> 01:44:05.108]  I think that's what they're practicing for.
[01:44:05.108 --> 01:44:06.949]  No, I have the documents, sir, as you know.
[01:44:06.949 --> 01:44:15.173]  I mean, they are gearing up for all-out war, and don't they know they're working for a bunch of Bernard Madoffs that this doesn't happen?
[01:44:15.173 --> 01:44:20.695]  No, they're getting unaccountable power.
[01:44:20.695 --> 01:44:27.579]  And, you know, the police have always had a large contingent of bullies in them.
[01:44:29.705 --> 01:44:33.692]  They're just getting unaccountable power and they're going to enjoy using it.
[01:44:36.096 --> 01:45:00.778]  As it implodes, as we go into this long, dark night, slow, incremental depression, and as you're saying, the establishment's on the same course, so it's a foregone conclusion, don't the police know that as they're CPSing everybody's kids and tasering and SWAT teaming and taxing and arresting people when they're not going to have insurance or even money, you know, to pay the tickets and the jails are full, don't the cops know that desperate people do desperate things and that
[01:45:01.278 --> 01:45:04.220]  It's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:10.383]  They're going to get their war, and it's not going to be three crackheads, they're fighting?
[01:45:10.383 --> 01:45:11.564]  They're going to have to learn that.
[01:45:11.564 --> 01:45:15.446]  No, I don't think they realize that.
[01:45:15.446 --> 01:45:24.672]  Look, what the future may look like is a high unemployment and high inflation.
[01:45:24.672 --> 01:45:27.053]  So it would be very threatening.
[01:45:27.625 --> 01:45:29.226]  to the general population.
[01:45:29.226 --> 01:45:34.388]  They'd be out of jobs, but prices would be rising.
[01:45:34.388 --> 01:45:40.450]  And this is a situation that they can't survive in.
[01:45:40.450 --> 01:45:47.853]  You know, it's not like the Depression when you're out of work but prices are falling.
[01:45:47.853 --> 01:45:49.954]  Is that called hyper-stag inflation?
[01:45:49.954 --> 01:45:54.375]  I mean, is that hyper-stag inflation?
[01:45:54.375 --> 01:45:56.356]  It's hyper-inflationary depression.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:59.142]  That's the real danger.
[01:45:59.142 --> 01:46:05.047]  I'm not absolutely certain it'll happen, but I'm certain that that is the real danger.
[01:46:05.047 --> 01:46:06.668]  And they're not thinking about it.
[01:46:06.668 --> 01:46:11.433]  They're not saying, how can we be sure this doesn't happen?
[01:46:11.433 --> 01:46:13.635]  It's not even on the radar screen.
[01:46:13.635 --> 01:46:19.741]  Well, the people I know in the country who have been lower middle class are now on the verge of all going bankrupt.
[01:46:19.741 --> 01:46:23.024]  Everybody I know in the country around Austin and East Texas
[01:46:23.997 --> 01:46:26.858]  And I'm in touch with a lot of, you know, rural people.
[01:46:26.858 --> 01:46:31.539]  And they say, yeah, we go to small towns one mile over the speed limit.
[01:46:31.539 --> 01:46:34.799]  They pull us over, give us tickets, want to search us.
[01:46:34.799 --> 01:46:36.720]  I mean, I mean, I was out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:38.880]  Our ranch is in the middle of nowhere.
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:43.021]  And I saw police every time I drove to the store 18 miles away.
[01:46:43.021 --> 01:46:46.142]  I mean, it's just total infestation.
[01:46:46.142 --> 01:46:49.542]  And I guess cancer doesn't know it's cancer, does it, Doc?
[01:46:49.542 --> 01:46:51.223]  I guess not, Alex.
[01:46:51.223 --> 01:46:51.763]  My God.
[01:46:52.757 --> 01:46:54.238]  So how do you see it all ending?
[01:46:54.238 --> 01:46:55.699]  Just in complete civil war?
[01:46:55.699 --> 01:47:00.822]  Or maybe just like Mexico, a bunch of poor people under jackboots?
[01:47:00.822 --> 01:47:03.383]  Probably like Mexico.
[01:47:03.383 --> 01:47:08.626]  But you know, the joker is we have all these nuclear weapons.
[01:47:08.626 --> 01:47:19.073]  So we don't know whether the rest of the world will say, hey, let's keep them going until we can figure out what to do about them.
[01:47:20.049 --> 01:47:21.810]  Or get them under control.
[01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:27.254]  But Russia had nukes and people let it implode?
[01:47:27.254 --> 01:47:30.977]  Yeah, because that was the way we were taking it over.
[01:47:30.977 --> 01:47:33.939]  And, of course, Putin stopped that.
[01:47:33.939 --> 01:47:43.466]  But, you know, I think that we are far more dangerous than the Russians because they were
[01:47:44.522 --> 01:47:52.605]  They were imploding in part because they gave up their belief in communism and they lost that kind of dangerous aggressiveness.
[01:47:52.605 --> 01:47:58.968]  But of course we just play it every minute of every day in Afghanistan and Pakistan and Iraq and wherever.
[01:47:59.750 --> 01:48:04.051]  So the world knows this is a psycho, decadent, mad dog, killing machine?
[01:48:04.051 --> 01:48:04.431]  Right.
[01:48:04.431 --> 01:48:06.431]  I think that sums it up.
[01:48:06.431 --> 01:48:08.252]  I think that's the way we're perceived.
[01:48:08.252 --> 01:48:15.793]  And I think the message with 9-11 is the establishment knows that anybody with a brain can tell that's an inside job, so it's a double-edged.
[01:48:15.793 --> 01:48:21.315]  For the general public, it's used to scare them to go along with the police state, but for the rest of the world, it's like, yeah!
[01:48:21.315 --> 01:48:24.135]  Yeah, we'll blow these buildings up to launch wars against you.
[01:48:24.135 --> 01:48:27.516]  That's why Gary Hart wrote that letter to Ahmed Dinejid and said, look,
[01:48:28.064 --> 01:48:29.324]  We staged terror attacks.
[01:48:29.324 --> 01:48:30.325]  Look at the Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:48:30.325 --> 01:48:31.385]  Look at the Maine.
[01:48:31.385 --> 01:48:33.425]  You better sit down and shut up.
[01:48:33.425 --> 01:48:41.167]  I mean... Yeah.
[01:48:41.167 --> 01:48:41.787]  It's crazy.
[01:48:41.787 --> 01:48:43.628]  It does make you laugh because it's so nuts.
[01:48:43.628 --> 01:48:46.608]  Well, you know, I'm not laughing at you.
[01:48:46.608 --> 01:48:47.548]  No, no, I understand.
[01:48:47.548 --> 01:48:49.109]  No, I mean, it's just laughing at the craziness.
[01:48:51.175 --> 01:49:07.609]  And the real craziness is that, you know, there's so many Americans that think themselves as the salt of the earth and good people, and if they heard us right now, they would really think we were completely insane and anti-American, and we should be arrested and shot.
[01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:16.757]  And I guess you hear from most people from time to time, but they think of themselves as just really decent people, and they're completely brainwashed.
[01:49:16.757 --> 01:49:17.757]  They have no clue.
[01:49:17.757 --> 01:49:19.579]  They have no idea of what's happening.
[01:49:22.518 --> 01:49:23.138]  Amazing.
[01:49:23.138 --> 01:49:31.123]  Well, Doctor, thank you for spending so much time with us, and I look forward to seeing you out in Florida when we come interview you.
[01:49:31.123 --> 01:49:36.605]  I may come in person or may just send the crew, but God bless you, and I really appreciate you spending so much time with us.
[01:49:36.605 --> 01:49:38.286]  Have a great weekend that's coming up.
[01:49:38.286 --> 01:49:40.487]  All the best to you, Alex.
[01:49:40.487 --> 01:49:42.949]  Wish you plenty of success.
[01:49:42.949 --> 01:49:43.569]  Thank you, sir.
[01:49:43.569 --> 01:49:44.009]  You as well.
[01:49:45.905 --> 01:49:46.646]  Goodbye.
[01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:55.712]  I'm going to come back and get into some financial news, and then we've got George Humphrey in studio.
[01:49:55.712 --> 01:50:05.679]  It's just mind-blowing to watch this happening, to see the IMF, to see the World Bank, to see the Federal Reserve saying they want a weak dollar.
[01:50:06.693 --> 01:50:08.835]  To know they're killing the dollar.
[01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:11.056]  Our own criminal government is killing our own dollar.
[01:50:11.056 --> 01:50:14.879]  All we have left, and the global, the UN states they want to de-industrialize us.
[01:50:14.879 --> 01:50:17.440]  They state they want to bankrupt us.
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:22.844]  Even Rush Limbaugh's telling the truth now and saying the government wants to bankrupt things to make us all dependent.
[01:50:22.844 --> 01:50:29.349]  Roberts is just a good guy, and he can't believe that they're doing all this by design.
[01:50:29.349 --> 01:50:32.771]  Well, look, they're making money at record levels.
[01:50:32.771 --> 01:50:33.872]  They're getting all this power.
[01:50:34.505 --> 01:50:41.691]  They're militarizing the police, they're putting troops on the streets by design, and this is all by design.
[01:50:41.691 --> 01:50:51.499]  But either way you slice it, any way you cut it, any way you look at it, any angle, this is muy grande bad.
[01:50:51.499 --> 01:50:55.602]  This is classical tyranny in a big, big way.
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:57.140]  Stay with us.
[01:50:57.140 --> 01:50:59.462]  We've got George Humphrey coming up and Katherine Austin Fitz.
[01:50:59.462 --> 01:51:02.203]  This is going to be really... Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.203 --> 01:51:07.786]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.786 --> 01:51:12.809]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.809 --> 01:51:13.289]  It's true.
[01:51:13.289 --> 01:51:18.371]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.371 --> 01:51:23.074]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.598 --> 01:51:30.721]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.721 --> 01:51:31.821]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.821 --> 01:51:34.883]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.883 --> 01:51:38.524]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.524 --> 01:51:41.705]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.705 --> 01:51:44.867]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.867 --> 01:51:45.067]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.067 --> 01:51:45.307]  Remember,
[01:51:53.650 --> 01:51:57.573]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.573 --> 01:52:01.075]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:01.075 --> 01:52:04.397]  Each day, one in four Americans visits a fast food restaurant.
[01:52:04.397 --> 01:52:06.998]  60% of all Americans are either overweight or obese.
[01:52:06.998 --> 01:52:09.220]  Fast food can bring fast lives to a screeching halt.
[01:52:10.589 --> 01:52:12.390]  Fast food is toxic food.
[01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:15.931]  One of the benefits of colon cleansing is to detoxify from fast food.
[01:52:15.931 --> 01:52:20.953]  Since 1985, thousands of Americans have chosen MediCleanse, the original colon cleanse.

[01:53:00.885 --> 01:53:07.867]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:53:07.867 --> 01:53:09.967]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:53:09.967 --> 01:53:12.208]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:53:12.208 --> 01:53:13.849]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:53:13.849 --> 01:53:18.330]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:53:53.848 --> 01:53:55.429]  Front porch sittin' in an old rockin' chair
[01:54:20.967 --> 01:54:22.788]  Alright, alright, alright.
[01:54:22.788 --> 01:54:27.732]  This is Ted Anderson.
[01:54:27.732 --> 01:54:30.114]  I'm standing in for Alex Jones.
[01:54:45.485 --> 01:54:48.907]  Well-deserved vacation day, day before Thanksgiving.
[01:54:48.907 --> 01:54:50.167]  Happy Thanksgiving to all.
[01:54:50.167 --> 01:54:52.868]  Today is 11... Today is 1125.
[01:54:52.868 --> 01:54:57.050]  We are looking at Thanksgiving tomorrow, in case you're wondering.
[01:54:57.050 --> 01:55:04.734]  This is now live, although Alex is in rebroadcast right now, playing you the best of his programming.
[01:55:04.734 --> 01:55:13.718]  Asked me personally today to come on air because gold is just shooting up like a rocket, so I pulled together some of the latest headlines he wants the economic news to be
[01:55:14.795 --> 01:55:17.138]  To be told or to get out there.
[01:55:17.138 --> 01:55:18.920]  This is from Reuters.
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:26.349]  It just says gold hits record on dollar talk of India buying.
[01:55:26.349 --> 01:55:28.572]  Next one here, I'm looking at Market Watch.
[01:55:28.572 --> 01:55:33.097]  It says gold hits high on India talk, weaker dollar.
[01:55:33.097 --> 01:55:34.439]  Next one, CNN Money.
[01:55:36.334 --> 01:55:37.855]  Dump the dollar, buy gold.
[01:55:37.855 --> 01:55:41.316]  I mean, these headlines are just amazing.
[01:55:41.316 --> 01:55:42.657]  Here's another one for you right here.
[01:55:42.657 --> 01:55:44.638]  This is another CNN Money.
[01:55:44.638 --> 01:55:47.980]  Gold hits record high on talk of India buying.
[01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:51.361]  Here's another one right here.
[01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:55.883]  This one is just off of, let's see here, gold hits record high.
[01:55:55.883 --> 01:55:58.244]  It's Google.
[01:55:58.244 --> 01:55:59.945]  Google News, I guess.
[01:55:59.945 --> 01:56:01.586]  Gold hits record high beyond $1,180 per ounce.
[01:56:04.571 --> 01:56:09.173]  Right now, India is negotiating buying the rest of that gold that the IMF was considering selling.
[01:56:09.173 --> 01:56:15.396]  Remember, it was 403 metric tons of gold that they wanted to sell into the marketplace.
[01:56:15.396 --> 01:56:22.279]  India stepped up and bought 200 of those metric tons here just a short time ago, about three weeks ago.
[01:56:22.279 --> 01:56:24.601]  Well, that leaves a little bit of that gold left.
[01:56:24.601 --> 01:56:26.521]  Now India is talking about buying up the rest of it.
[01:56:26.521 --> 01:56:33.585]  This is just one nation on this world that's deciding to buy up the gold that the IMF has been selling.
[01:56:35.019 --> 01:56:36.460]  And the market just goes nuts.
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:40.864]  I mean, right now, we're looking at gold up over $1,180 an ounce.
[01:56:40.864 --> 01:56:47.129]  Today, already, the high has been up as high as $1,188.
[01:56:47.129 --> 01:56:50.352]  I mean, obviously, we're looking at $1,200 an ounce of gold.
[01:56:50.352 --> 01:56:52.253]  I know the Aiden sisters were talking about that.
[01:56:52.253 --> 01:57:01.921]  Bloomberg, I mean, you have a whole long line, whole long line of analysts, people that are considered to be experts in the marketplace.
[01:57:01.921 --> 01:57:02.382]  Bloomberg
[01:57:03.129 --> 01:57:06.190]  Typically, not a gold bug.
[01:57:06.190 --> 01:57:15.573]  Not a gold bug at all, but they have been talking about gold going up for, well, obviously for the last couple of years, and they've been right on target.
[01:57:15.573 --> 01:57:21.014]  Bob Chapman, International Forecaster, another very strong, bullish recommendation for gold.
[01:57:21.014 --> 01:57:32.738]  I received here today, and I'm going to have to go through it, probably going to have to let the break go and then finish it, Congressman Ron Paul's campaign for liberty letter, and there's a paragraph in there
[01:57:33.829 --> 01:57:37.311]  That I would like to read to you just real quick, and please bear with me.
[01:57:37.311 --> 01:57:45.156]  It just says, The Federal Reserve has created our problem, yet it manages to gain even more power of socialism of the entire financial system.
[01:57:45.156 --> 01:57:59.686]  The whole bailout process this past couple of years has been characterized by no oversight, no limits, no concerns, no understanding, and worst of all, no common sense.
[01:58:00.458 --> 01:58:06.683]  I mean, that just sums it up, and I always have to take my hat off to Ron Paul.
[01:58:06.683 --> 01:58:19.133]  I mean, you hear some of the other congressmen up there in Congress talking about the Fed and how it should have this transparency bill passed, but nobody leads the fight like Congressman Ron Paul does.
[01:58:19.133 --> 01:58:23.477]  We're going to touch a little bit more on the economic news on the other side of this break.
[01:58:23.477 --> 01:58:24.918]  Please bear with us for one minute.
[01:58:24.918 --> 01:58:25.619]  We'll be right back.

[01:58:50.714 --> 01:58:59.862]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:58:59.862 --> 01:59:03.245]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:59:03.245 --> 01:59:09.111]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:59:09.111 --> 01:59:13.895]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:59:13.895 --> 01:59:16.237]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:59:16.517 --> 01:59:16.878]  I'm good.

[01:59:56.327 --> 01:59:59.108]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.635 --> 02:00:10.438]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.438 --> 02:00:12.039]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.039 --> 02:00:13.600]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:17.782]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.782 --> 02:00:22.105]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.105 --> 02:00:25.146]  Alright, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:00:25.146 --> 02:00:26.787]  I'm standing in for Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.787 --> 02:00:29.289]  He asked me to come up with some economic news.
[02:00:29.289 --> 02:00:33.151]  You know, give you the information that's going on out there.
[02:00:33.956 --> 02:00:35.299]  I mean, there's just no relief.
[02:00:35.299 --> 02:00:42.672]  Usually on a Thanksgiving weekend, you could count on the fact that the markets would calm down and you wouldn't see a whole lot of activity.
[02:00:42.672 --> 02:00:45.677]  But, of course, Thanksgiving is only celebrated here in the United States.
[02:00:46.431 --> 02:00:53.755]  And places like India and Asia and so on and so forth that have been driving the gold and silver market have been just driving gold up through the roof.
[02:00:53.755 --> 02:00:58.738]  Right now, today, gold has almost hit $1,190 an ounce.
[02:00:58.738 --> 02:01:02.881]  We are only $12 away from seeing $1,200 an ounce gold.
[02:01:02.881 --> 02:01:05.422]  And obviously, the markets are very hot.
[02:01:05.422 --> 02:01:11.426]  Alex asked if I would offer a deal, same deal that I did yesterday, for gold and silver.
[02:01:11.426 --> 02:01:13.587]  At this moment, I told him I would.
[02:01:16.948 --> 02:01:21.290]  The prices that I have have been held to about a week ago here.
[02:01:21.290 --> 02:01:24.531]  Now we do have the British Sovereign and it's currently at $3.25.
[02:01:24.531 --> 02:01:27.452]  We have Franks at $2.63.
[02:01:27.452 --> 02:01:31.473]  We have Walking Liberty Halves, oh my goodness, they're at $8.69.
[02:01:31.473 --> 02:01:35.434]  That price is so far under what I would normally sell something like that for.
[02:01:36.395 --> 02:01:40.480]  $20 Liberties, almost $300 below what my normal price is.
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:43.223]  $10 Liberties right now at $818.50.
[02:01:43.223 --> 02:01:48.749]  They're over $1,000 if you buy them just outright from us without mentioning the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:48.749 --> 02:01:50.631]  And a brand new coin from the Montana
[02:01:52.493 --> 02:01:52.854]  I think?
[02:02:12.126 --> 02:02:15.329]  If you haven't been, I don't know where you should be.
[02:02:15.329 --> 02:02:22.857]  But if you have been and you're thinking about doing it, now is a great time to do it because the prices are so well discounted at this point.
[02:02:22.857 --> 02:02:29.804]  I'm nervous as a cat doing this just due to the fact that my guess is Friday is going to open up even higher still.
[02:02:29.804 --> 02:02:31.586]  Then I'll have to move my prices up.
[02:02:31.586 --> 02:02:32.567]  I just won't have a choice.
[02:02:33.447 --> 02:02:40.549]  But you can call us here at Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:02:40.549 --> 02:02:41.249]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:02:41.249 --> 02:02:55.872]  And because we'll be officially closed tomorrow, other than a few brokers that like to show up even on holidays, you'll be able to lock in these prices clear through Thanksgiving all the way up through midnight.
[02:02:55.872 --> 02:03:02.153]  And then Friday comes along, and I'm looking at $1,190 plus on the ounce for gold.
[02:03:02.153 --> 02:03:02.633]  It's going to be
[02:03:03.186 --> 02:03:05.288]  Higher prices, that's just the way it is.
[02:03:05.288 --> 02:03:14.876]  I mean, my inventory is running slim and I know darn well that I have to pay a lot more than what gold is trading for today in order to support what's going on.
[02:03:14.876 --> 02:03:21.622]  For those of you who have watched Fall of the Republic or had picked up a copy of it, I want to thank you for that.
[02:03:21.622 --> 02:03:27.727]  And for those of you who have supported Midas Resources and Genesis Communications Network, either by listening or
[02:03:30.931 --> 02:03:33.072]  Or purchasing gold from Midas Resources.
[02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:34.813]  I just have a little treat.
[02:03:34.813 --> 02:03:45.099]  Starting Monday, we'll be running Follow the Republic ads across all of the mainstream media, all of the neocon, mainstream media shows that you hear out there.
[02:03:45.099 --> 02:03:47.240]  You're going to hear it on Rush Limbaugh.
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:49.021]  You'll hear it on Sean Hannity.
[02:03:49.021 --> 02:03:54.024]  I mean, it's going to be up on CNN, SiriusXM, Fox.
[02:03:54.024 --> 02:03:55.645]  I mean, you just name it, they're all out there.
[02:03:55.645 --> 02:03:57.626]  We're going to be running it in there as a
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:16.547]  I just need to tell you that the crew at Alex's organization have just gone all out and this has got to be the best video I have ever seen tying together the whole New World Order agenda, including this global warming, the banking system.
[02:04:16.547 --> 02:04:21.509]  I just, you know, it describes everything and makes it so very clear.
[02:04:21.509 --> 02:04:25.751]  I just hope this thing sells like crazy and of course there's a boost for Alex.
[02:04:25.751 --> 02:04:26.211]  I just want to
[02:04:27.009 --> 02:04:29.532]  I just tell you that that video is so important.
[02:04:29.532 --> 02:04:34.878]  If you haven't placed an order for the Fall of the Republic yet, go to InfoWars.com and get it.
[02:04:34.878 --> 02:04:37.982]  If you want to get us here at Midas Resources, call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:04:37.982 --> 02:04:40.505]  And from my family to yours, have a Happy Thanksgiving!
[02:05:00.765 --> 02:05:04.147]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.147 --> 02:05:07.769]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.769 --> 02:05:12.351]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.351 --> 02:05:17.934]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.234 --> 02:05:22.998]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.998 --> 02:05:26.621]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.621 --> 02:05:31.445]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.445 --> 02:05:38.011]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:38.011 --> 02:05:39.953]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.433 --> 02:05:43.636]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.636 --> 02:05:48.140]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:50.302]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.302 --> 02:05:50.362]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.362 --> 02:05:51.363]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:01.428 --> 02:06:04.429]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.429 --> 02:06:09.772]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.772 --> 02:06:11.812]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.812 --> 02:06:16.815]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.815 --> 02:06:17.995]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.995 --> 02:06:19.116]  When do you want it?
[02:06:19.116 --> 02:06:21.016]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:21.016 --> 02:06:22.077]  When will you need it?
[02:06:22.077 --> 02:06:24.278]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.278 --> 02:06:25.618]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.618 --> 02:06:26.939]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.139 --> 02:06:32.405]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.405 --> 02:06:35.989]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.989 --> 02:06:39.814]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.814 --> 02:06:41.055]  How much will you need?
[02:06:41.055 --> 02:06:41.956]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.956 --> 02:06:43.058]  How much do you want?
[02:06:43.058 --> 02:06:43.999]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.999 --> 02:06:44.820]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:48.124]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:48.124 --> 02:06:50.327]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:50.327 --> 02:06:51.329]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.478 --> 02:07:05.785]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.785 --> 02:07:10.331]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.331 --> 02:07:12.614]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.614 --> 02:07:14.236]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:14.236 --> 02:07:15.258]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.478 --> 02:07:23.907]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:07:23.907 --> 02:07:31.375]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:07:31.375 --> 02:07:37.021]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:07:37.401 --> 02:07:43.426]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:07:43.426 --> 02:07:47.569]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:07:47.569 --> 02:07:55.034]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[02:07:55.034 --> 02:07:58.337]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:08:01.696 --> 02:08:15.579]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.579 --> 02:08:18.299]  George Humphrey is our guest of the Balance of the Hour.
[02:08:18.299 --> 02:08:26.901]  He popped by the office last week to get some more copies of All the Republic, my new documentary film that he's a big part of, one of our economists that we have in there, breaking the facts down.
[02:08:26.901 --> 02:08:30.562]  We have three economists in the film, and you're one of the most informative.
[02:08:31.374 --> 02:08:34.646]  And I said, why not just come in for most of an hour next week?
[02:08:34.646 --> 02:08:35.810]  And we're very honored.
[02:08:36.696 --> 02:08:37.616]  Have him with us.
[02:08:37.616 --> 02:08:47.500]  He is a degreed economist, very successful businessman, former Austin City Councilman, author, filmmaker, and he's been somebody fighting the New World Order longer than I have been.
[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:49.861]  He's been fighting it, what, 18 years or so.
[02:08:49.861 --> 02:08:56.663]  Two years before I got on air, 14 years ago, I'd met George at some functions and events when I was just trying to understand what was happening.
[02:08:56.663 --> 02:09:01.545]  So he's been certainly a mentor to me, helping me along, and we've all grown together.
[02:09:01.545 --> 02:09:02.505]  George, it's great to have you here.
[02:09:03.855 --> 02:09:07.296]  As always, as I said last week, it's an honor to be here.
[02:09:07.296 --> 02:09:07.996]  And you know what?
[02:09:07.996 --> 02:09:10.817]  Not only is it an honor, it's fun to be here.
[02:09:10.817 --> 02:09:13.178]  It's fun to be at the center of the storm.
[02:09:13.178 --> 02:09:15.958]  It's fun to be fighting the good fight.
[02:09:15.958 --> 02:09:18.699]  It's fun to be making new friends.
[02:09:18.699 --> 02:09:20.760]  It's fun to be talking about the truth.
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:27.321]  It's fun to be working for a better world and a better America and a better family and a better self.
[02:09:27.321 --> 02:09:29.402]  And so thanks a lot for letting me be here.
[02:09:29.997 --> 02:09:32.038]  Well, George, it's awesome having you here with us.
[02:09:32.038 --> 02:09:36.080]  I want to cover a lot of subjects because you're knowledgeable on them all.
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:40.963]  And, of course, you've done your own local TV show here as well and done a lot of radio, so you can speak on all these issues.
[02:09:40.963 --> 02:09:46.025]  First off, as an economist, can you explain to people how fractional reserve banking works in a nutshell?
[02:09:46.025 --> 02:09:48.687]  How more debt is created than physical assets?
[02:09:48.687 --> 02:09:54.670]  How this financial engineered system is the key to the globalist power because they control the issuance of currency and credit?
[02:09:55.134 --> 02:09:57.815]  Well, we'll boil it down to about one minute.
[02:09:57.815 --> 02:10:02.977]  And what you need to remember is the initials O-T-A.
[02:10:02.977 --> 02:10:04.017]  O-T-A.
[02:10:04.017 --> 02:10:06.278]  Out of thin air.
[02:10:06.278 --> 02:10:21.544]  And back in 1776, Rothschild together with, when he helped start the Illuminati, they realized that by creating fractional reserve banking,
[02:10:22.330 --> 02:10:39.003]  is that they could convince the people of the nation to put in their gold and silver and assets and give them a script or a piece of paper that said that they had it and then they would make loans based upon this script.
[02:10:39.003 --> 02:10:50.552]  Now, as time went on, the reserves that were backing the deposits got smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.
[02:10:51.175 --> 02:10:54.716]  Now our founding fathers were very, very hip to this.
[02:10:54.716 --> 02:10:56.836]  Each and every one of our founding fathers.
[02:10:56.836 --> 02:11:05.458]  That's why they put in Article 1, Section 7 and Article 1, Section 9 that our banking system had to have gold and silver as a backing.
[02:11:05.458 --> 02:11:14.760]  It was to be controlled by the public and that money was supposed to have real value and not just be a commodity.
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:19.701]  And of course, this has been the central fight within our nation
[02:11:20.134 --> 02:11:27.901]  From 1776 through today, and Washington and Jefferson and Madison and Thomas Paine all talked about it.
[02:11:27.901 --> 02:11:35.327]  And then John Quincy Adams talked about it, Andrew Jackson talked about it, and they tried to assassinate him five times.
[02:11:35.327 --> 02:11:36.528]  Abraham Lincoln came in.
[02:11:36.528 --> 02:11:38.710]  This has always been the main threat to our country.
[02:11:38.710 --> 02:11:46.717]  This is the number one threat because whoever, follow the money, when I first got elected on the city council, I think it was
[02:11:47.489 --> 02:11:52.653]  I forgot who it was, but they came into my office and he said, always follow the money.
[02:11:52.653 --> 02:11:56.916]  And this is in little bitty Austin politics.
[02:11:56.916 --> 02:12:02.721]  And so when you wanted to find out what was going on, and I woke, I got very hip to that very quick.
[02:12:02.721 --> 02:12:08.185]  Always follow the money because that is the way the puppet masters control us.
[02:12:08.185 --> 02:12:10.447]  Through the money, number one.
[02:12:10.447 --> 02:12:16.031]  And so then through Abraham Lincoln and McKinley and Ford and uh...
[02:12:16.881 --> 02:12:41.898]  And then up to John F. Kennedy and now to Dr. Ron Paul, we are all talking about the discrepancy between what the Constitution says and where we're supposed to have a currency, a banking system that's controlled by the people, backed by gold and silver, a hard currency, versus what we have, which is the Federal Reserve Banking Act.
[02:12:41.898 --> 02:12:46.461]  And of course, as all of you know by now, it's not federal, there's no reserves.
[02:12:47.658 --> 02:12:49.599]  Hey, George, that's a big deal.
[02:12:49.599 --> 02:12:52.280]  Ten years ago, you couldn't say, as you all know.
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:58.523]  Now, in major polls, 75-80% know it's private, want to abolish, they're audited.
[02:12:58.523 --> 02:13:00.403]  I mean, we've had a complete flip.
[02:13:00.403 --> 02:13:04.125]  I mean, what, 10-15 years ago, maybe 5% of people knew?
[02:13:04.125 --> 02:13:06.386]  Now, I mean, look, we've had huge success, thank God!
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:22.068]  I am so glad you brought that up because 15 years ago when I talked about this I had to speak it with a very hush voice and show all the numbers and show everything and people's eyes would get real wide.
[02:13:22.068 --> 02:13:25.070]  You're saying there's nothing behind their money system?
[02:13:25.070 --> 02:13:28.111]  The Federal Reserve is not a government agency?
[02:13:28.111 --> 02:13:31.453]  And now almost everybody knows it.
[02:13:32.489 --> 02:13:37.231]  The people at Starbucks, the people at Walmart, people are hip to this.
[02:13:37.231 --> 02:13:44.994]  And we have to thank you, we have to thank Dr. Ron Paul, and the hundreds of thousands of patriots all around this country.
[02:13:44.994 --> 02:13:56.239]  And the real power, the real credit, goes not just to the leaders fighting this, but the people that have been person to person with the books, the films, the events.
[02:13:56.239 --> 02:13:58.380]  It is the people.
[02:13:58.900 --> 02:13:59.100]  Exactly.
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:02.383]  And that's the reason the establishment hasn't just killed us.
[02:14:02.383 --> 02:14:04.845]  20, 30 years ago they would kill people if we were talking about this.
[02:14:04.845 --> 02:14:05.625]  They would kill congressmen.
[02:14:05.625 --> 02:14:08.588]  What was the fellow's name?
[02:14:08.588 --> 02:14:09.388]  Larry McDonald.
[02:14:09.388 --> 02:14:10.349]  He got whacked in 1981.
[02:14:10.349 --> 02:14:14.212]  They would kidnap congressmen and senators' kids and kill them if they spoke out.
[02:14:14.212 --> 02:14:19.356]  But the point is, now that the idea is out there, and that ideas are bulletproof, they're having a...
[02:14:20.217 --> 02:14:21.177]  A big problem.
[02:14:21.177 --> 02:14:24.958]  Early on they knew they could shut it down if they could just get the few people quiet.
[02:14:24.958 --> 02:14:25.178]  Right.
[02:14:25.178 --> 02:14:26.298]  But now it's too late.
[02:14:26.298 --> 02:14:26.919]  Yeah.
[02:14:26.919 --> 02:14:28.039]  The cat's out of the bag.
[02:14:28.039 --> 02:14:29.439]  Because Washington's out of the bag, yeah.
[02:14:29.439 --> 02:14:32.260]  And so people are getting more aware.
[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:46.423]  And being aware that money is the way of control, and that the Federal Reserve, controlled by whatever you want to call these rascals, whether you want to call them the cabal, the plutocracy, whether you want to call them the Illuminati, the power elite,
[02:14:46.983 --> 02:14:52.887]  These people are in separation consciousness, they're in fear, and they're manipulating and controlling.
[02:14:52.887 --> 02:14:55.509]  They're the pirates, and there's always been pirates.
[02:14:55.509 --> 02:14:57.250]  And we gotta get that through our heads.
[02:14:57.250 --> 02:15:08.098]  The people who control our banking systems and control our government are one and the same, and they are manipulating and milking this economy for everything that they can.
[02:15:08.098 --> 02:15:15.724]  And they are creating, and it's not money, they're not creating, don't use the word money, they're creating debt-based currencies.
[02:15:16.718 --> 02:15:16.798]  Yes.
[02:15:16.798 --> 02:15:18.240]  And it is absolutely the biggest
[02:15:25.891 --> 02:15:26.312]  Yes, we are.
[02:15:50.083 --> 02:15:54.264]  That debt based upon other debt continues to go up.
[02:15:54.264 --> 02:15:57.865]  And so now it's going up like a hockey stick.
[02:15:57.865 --> 02:16:05.266]  And the actual debt on the debt is getting as big as the equity itself.
[02:16:05.266 --> 02:16:13.248]  And remember, with fractional reserve banking, this money can never be paid back.
[02:16:13.248 --> 02:16:19.809]  Let's say we cut back all government spending and all taxes went to paying off the debt.
[02:16:20.669 --> 02:16:26.011]  It is still mathematically impossible to pay off the debt.
[02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:28.871]  And of course, we're not going to stop spending.
[02:16:28.871 --> 02:16:31.072]  We're not going to stop creating debt.
[02:16:31.072 --> 02:16:38.634]  As I heard Dr. Roberts just speak, and he was an incredible guest, and I really give you a lot of credit for having him on.
[02:16:38.634 --> 02:16:47.877]  He was saying, as we were talking about last week, this year's federal budget debt is 400% greater than the year before.
[02:16:50.905 --> 02:16:55.290]  That is absolute, incredible insanity.
[02:16:55.290 --> 02:17:00.056]  You can't get out of debt by digging the hole deeper.
[02:17:00.056 --> 02:17:00.817]  You can't do it.
[02:17:00.817 --> 02:17:03.120]  And it's made up debt to the private banks.
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:04.281]  Of course it is.
[02:17:04.281 --> 02:17:07.565]  And all this money is going
[02:17:09.516 --> 02:17:10.036]  Here's a question.
[02:17:10.036 --> 02:17:12.498]  We're approaching an endgame here.
[02:17:12.498 --> 02:17:27.991]  What do you think the time frame, you know, a few months ago, filming Follow the Republic at your house, we were standing around the kitchen drinking tea, talking about the, you know, time frames, whether it's going to be inflation or whether it's going to be depression, what's going to happen with the currency.
[02:17:27.991 --> 02:17:29.172]  How do you see this unfolding?
[02:17:29.172 --> 02:17:31.513]  Okay, first of all, we have to learn from history.
[02:17:31.513 --> 02:17:36.137]  And in 1989, a very similar situation hit Japan.
[02:17:36.137 --> 02:17:36.738]  And they had
[02:17:38.151 --> 02:17:42.133]  Financing vehicles that were very similar to our derivatives.
[02:17:42.133 --> 02:17:44.175]  And they crashed.
[02:17:44.175 --> 02:17:51.619]  And yet, the ruling class of Japan would not flush those out of the system because they were protecting the ruling class.
[02:17:51.619 --> 02:17:56.042]  Now, Japan is the most productive nation per capita in the world.
[02:17:56.042 --> 02:17:56.602]  Yeah, that's the difference.
[02:17:56.602 --> 02:18:00.964]  They have this glistening industry, incredibly hardworking, focused people.
[02:18:00.964 --> 02:18:05.067]  So, you give us the same recipe, but with our big welfare state and laziness,
[02:18:05.771 --> 02:18:06.392]  We're dead meat.
[02:18:06.392 --> 02:18:06.832]  Yes.
[02:18:06.832 --> 02:18:22.426]  And Japan, in the period of time since 1989, their amount of monies that they have spent from their federal government trying to fix this situation has been approximately equal to what we're doing right now.
[02:18:22.426 --> 02:18:29.533]  And Japan, even though they're one of the world's leading exporters, they're incredibly technologically advanced.
[02:18:30.011 --> 02:18:32.913]  They have had 20 years of recession.
[02:18:32.913 --> 02:18:34.273]  The Nikkei was at $39,000.
[02:18:34.273 --> 02:18:37.195]  It's $9,000 right now.
[02:18:37.195 --> 02:18:39.076]  The real estate boom has gone down.
[02:18:39.076 --> 02:18:40.497]  And I go to Japan all the time.
[02:18:40.497 --> 02:18:42.317]  I'm going to be going there shortly.
[02:18:42.317 --> 02:18:43.958]  And it's an amazing place.
[02:18:43.958 --> 02:18:45.339]  These people work.
[02:18:45.339 --> 02:18:48.681]  They're educated and they're focused on creating money.
[02:18:48.681 --> 02:18:50.102]  And they've been going for 20 years.
[02:18:51.142 --> 02:19:01.006]  And they're still in the hole, because all of the money that they're producing, all their profits, is going to pay the interest on their derivatives.
[02:19:01.006 --> 02:19:02.987]  It's called the Japan Syndrome.
[02:19:02.987 --> 02:19:06.688]  And so we are in a very, very similar situation here.
[02:19:06.688 --> 02:19:07.708]  But worse!
[02:19:07.708 --> 02:19:08.829]  But worse!
[02:19:08.829 --> 02:19:09.849]  But worse!
[02:19:09.849 --> 02:19:20.233]  And what is even, what I consider to be worse, is the quality of the consciousness and the energy of the people in this country.
[02:19:21.152 --> 02:19:30.555]  We used to be that most hard-working, self-sufficient, freedom-loving, honest people in the whole country, in the whole world.
[02:19:30.555 --> 02:19:31.715]  We're making generalizations.
[02:19:31.715 --> 02:19:33.836]  We're not saying everybody's bad.
[02:19:33.836 --> 02:19:36.797]  It's just that you go out there, we're a lot of demonic goblin people.
[02:19:37.529 --> 02:19:39.591]  I mean, there are a lot of really evil people.
[02:19:39.591 --> 02:19:46.797]  And I'm glad you said, you know, sometimes, you know, in talking about this stuff, you know, there are so many good people in this country.
[02:19:46.797 --> 02:19:48.318]  We've aborted 51 million babies.
[02:19:48.318 --> 02:19:50.840]  The CPS kidnaps a million kids a year.
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:57.365]  If you take a look at the situation... We're going to come back and go over this, get into the flu, get into the police state.
[02:19:57.365 --> 02:19:57.505]  U.S.
[02:19:57.505 --> 02:20:00.468]  military employs counterinsurgency strategy in California City.
[02:20:01.128 --> 02:20:05.609]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[02:20:05.609 --> 02:20:09.890]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[02:20:09.890 --> 02:20:20.713]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[02:20:20.713 --> 02:20:22.773]  These key ingredients not only supply power
[02:20:22.813 --> 02:20:23.233]  I think so.
[02:20:44.491 --> 02:20:45.332]  Call 1-877-HEAL-4-GOOD.
[02:20:45.332 --> 02:20:46.133]  1-877-HEAL-4-GOOD.
[02:20:46.133 --> 02:20:46.593]  That's 877-432-5446.

[02:21:00.839 --> 02:21:03.021]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:03.881]  Spy on me?
[02:21:03.881 --> 02:21:04.201]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.201 --> 02:21:09.245]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:09.245 --> 02:21:10.866]  You should use Startpage instead.

[02:22:00.658 --> 02:22:07.340]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:15.463]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.463 --> 02:22:23.625]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:23.625 --> 02:22:28.387]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:28.707 --> 02:22:33.929]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:33.929 --> 02:22:38.270]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:39.370]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:24:06.505 --> 02:24:07.525]  George Humphreys our guest.
[02:24:07.525 --> 02:24:10.706]  We're going to take your calls coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:10.706 --> 02:24:11.406]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:11.406 --> 02:24:16.768]  I'd like to respect our guests and direct questions or comments at George.
[02:24:16.768 --> 02:24:17.688]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:17.688 --> 02:24:29.291]  In fact, I'm going to say today, first-time callers, we're going to wipe the phone board right now, or go through the calls and ask if they're first-time callers because I want to give some new people a chance.
[02:24:29.291 --> 02:24:29.351]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:34.697 --> 02:24:38.622]  Uh, George, you were trying to make a point before we went to break, but I wanted to make this point.
[02:24:38.622 --> 02:24:39.763]  It's a double-edged sword.
[02:24:39.763 --> 02:24:49.035]  Not only for 15 years have I been speaking out, or 14 years on air, you 18 or more, and many others for decades, like Ron Paul 30 plus years.
[02:24:50.672 --> 02:24:52.453]  It takes time to do this.
[02:24:52.453 --> 02:25:00.457]  The globalists love to give us an instant gratification society, where we expect everything instantly, but they understand the power of taking their time.
[02:25:00.457 --> 02:25:06.019]  So that's why we need to counter them with that, knowing that we're not going to see instant results when we do something.
[02:25:06.019 --> 02:25:08.860]  It takes time to go out and bounce around and grow.
[02:25:08.860 --> 02:25:09.681]  It's like seeds.
[02:25:09.681 --> 02:25:10.821]  It's like growing a crop.
[02:25:10.821 --> 02:25:11.962]  Right.
[02:25:11.962 --> 02:25:12.722]  Absolutely.
[02:25:12.722 --> 02:25:17.764]  And the question is, is that every one of us has a choice in front of us.
[02:25:17.764 --> 02:25:18.785]  We all have a choice.
[02:25:19.577 --> 02:25:33.610]  Do we actually believe that freedom and sovereignty and the highest values of the Constitution are something that are positive for our nation, for our community, for our families, and for ourselves?
[02:25:33.610 --> 02:25:36.433]  And most people will go, oh yeah, yeah, of course it is.
[02:25:36.433 --> 02:25:42.298]  But is this something that really is freedom and sovereignty for ourselves?
[02:25:43.149 --> 02:25:45.111]  And in the coming future, important.
[02:26:02.489 --> 02:26:14.700]  This is just not words, is that the Illuminati or the Power Leader, whatever you want to call these rascals, have created the most amazing and the most subtle mind control at every different level.
[02:26:15.262 --> 02:26:33.531]  Physical, emotional, spiritual, electronic, at all different levels to interrupt our chakra system, to interrupt our endocrine system, to interrupt the way that we as human beings are able to intellectually process information.
[02:26:33.531 --> 02:26:42.515]  And that's what all the globalists, when we cover this in Endgame, they admit they're poisoning us, they're poisoning our food and water to make us more easily controlled.
[02:26:42.515 --> 02:26:43.516]  Oh, it's amazing.
[02:26:45.707 --> 02:27:00.700]  In 1942 through 1945, both Uncle Adolf Hitler and Uncle Joseph Stalin were putting fluoride into their concentration camps because fluoride is a thyroid inhibitor.
[02:27:00.700 --> 02:27:02.862]  And that's in a Pulitzer Prize winning book.
[02:27:02.862 --> 02:27:04.303]  That came out in Nuremberg.
[02:27:04.303 --> 02:27:05.625]  That is not a conspiracy.
[02:27:05.625 --> 02:27:06.485]  Of course.
[02:27:06.485 --> 02:27:08.227]  This is fact.
[02:27:08.942 --> 02:27:11.624]  And it's been fact for 50 years.
[02:27:11.624 --> 02:27:21.711]  And they do it here, and the local media likes to laugh and feel like they're part of the establishment, and even though we've got probably 100,000 Austinites awake, and we're all over the country, we can't get it out of our water.
[02:27:21.711 --> 02:27:24.753]  And so, massive amounts of fluoride.
[02:27:24.753 --> 02:27:37.923]  In Florida, they started putting in the water in the late 1880s because the aluminum industry had nowhere to put their toxic waste, and they cooked up these false studies to show that it would protect teeth, which is absolute
[02:27:39.022 --> 02:27:39.803]  B.S.
[02:27:39.803 --> 02:27:45.250]  and every independent study has shown that fluoride does not protect teeth.
[02:27:45.250 --> 02:27:56.604]  And what's really important, of all the water that goes through the city water, less than one half of one percent of the water that goes through the taps is actually taken and used for drinking water.
[02:27:57.222 --> 02:28:00.505]  And so this whole concept is absolutely silly.
[02:28:00.505 --> 02:28:04.769]  So let's say that fluoride really did help tooth decay, which it does not.
[02:28:04.769 --> 02:28:07.312]  There's better ways, topical ways of using it.
[02:28:07.312 --> 02:28:09.714]  It gives you fluorosis, it causes bone cancer.
[02:28:09.714 --> 02:28:13.298]  But let's just say it's good, why don't they say to it topically, now we're going to put it in the water.
[02:28:14.298 --> 02:28:17.901]  Now they're using it as a pesticide on crops.
[02:28:17.901 --> 02:28:19.682]  It kills bugs, but we're going to drink it.
[02:28:19.682 --> 02:28:26.086]  And for years and years and years, back in the 30s, 40s and 50s, the number one ingredient in rat poison was fluoride.
[02:28:29.128 --> 02:28:32.891]  You can still buy it where it says fluoride on the back!
[02:28:32.891 --> 02:28:34.192]  Decon rat poison!
[02:28:45.982 --> 02:28:48.125]  Within their own conscious development.
[02:28:48.125 --> 02:28:49.927]  The electrical system in the body.
[02:28:49.927 --> 02:28:50.908]  Exactly.
[02:28:50.908 --> 02:28:52.089]  Exactly.
[02:28:52.089 --> 02:28:57.535]  And not in our pituitary is being messed up with aspartame.
[02:28:57.535 --> 02:29:00.339]  The chemtrails are coming in.
[02:29:00.339 --> 02:29:01.720]  MSG.
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:02.201]  Mercury.
[02:29:02.201 --> 02:29:06.305]  What about the media saying there's no mercury in the flu shot when it's on the insert?
[02:29:06.846 --> 02:29:10.388]  That's Tumerosal, which is even more toxic than mercury is.
[02:29:10.388 --> 02:29:13.110]  I mean, you know, they change the name.
[02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:14.551]  It's a hyper form of mercury.
[02:29:14.551 --> 02:29:16.612]  It's a hyper form of mercury.
[02:29:16.612 --> 02:29:20.275]  And the second most toxic element on the charts
[02:29:20.999 --> 02:29:25.202]  After, you know, plutonium and uranium is mercury.
[02:29:25.202 --> 02:29:31.307]  And what mercury does is it inhibits the ability of the synapse to send messages.
[02:29:31.307 --> 02:29:45.658]  And so when people start getting mercury in their system, which almost every person does now at different degrees, you start having larger percentage of ADD, attention deficit disorder, and obesity.
[02:29:45.658 --> 02:29:45.999]  Stay there.
[02:29:45.999 --> 02:29:46.519]  We're coming back.
[02:29:46.519 --> 02:29:47.039]  Long segment.
[02:29:47.039 --> 02:29:47.900]  We're going to cover it all.
[02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:49.101]  George Humphrey is our guest.
[02:29:49.101 --> 02:29:49.541]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.508 --> 02:29:52.908]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.908 --> 02:29:55.449]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.449 --> 02:30:00.970]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.970 --> 02:30:07.971]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecolablue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:30:07.971 --> 02:30:09.231]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:30:09.231 --> 02:30:10.031]  It's very real.
[02:30:10.031 --> 02:30:12.272]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:30:12.272 --> 02:30:13.932]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:31:00.672 --> 02:31:05.216]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.216 --> 02:31:06.137]  Number one.
[02:31:06.137 --> 02:31:09.560]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:10.420]  Number two.
[02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:15.305]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.305 --> 02:31:16.065]  It's true.
[02:31:16.065 --> 02:31:20.929]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.929 --> 02:31:21.390]  Number three.
[02:31:21.730 --> 02:31:25.333]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.333 --> 02:31:29.256]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.256 --> 02:31:30.036]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.036 --> 02:31:32.798]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.798 --> 02:31:36.481]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.481 --> 02:31:37.281]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.281 --> 02:31:41.424]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.424 --> 02:31:46.188]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.468 --> 02:31:50.633]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.633 --> 02:31:52.435]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.435 --> 02:31:54.678]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:54.678 --> 02:31:57.021]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:01.442 --> 02:32:07.006]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.
[02:32:07.006 --> 02:32:21.475]  If you suffer from chronic or recurring pain, or if you take prescription drugs for pain, then you owe it to yourself to visit TPR20info.com and get TPR20, the effective pain relief cream, without the harmful side effects of prescription drugs.
[02:32:21.875 --> 02:32:25.959]  I use TPR-20 for arthritis in my hand and it works great.
[02:32:25.959 --> 02:32:30.462]  It relieves the pain fast and fights the inflammation to keep the pain away longer.
[02:32:30.462 --> 02:32:39.630]  On TPR20info.com, you can read about the many uses of TPR-20, like arthritis, fibromyalgia, sports injuries, back pain, sore muscles, and much, much more.
[02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:40.570]  We're good to go.
[02:33:12.563 --> 02:33:15.925]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m., around 3 p.m.
[02:33:15.925 --> 02:33:16.345]  Central.
[02:33:16.345 --> 02:33:17.046]  I'm here live.
[02:33:17.046 --> 02:33:18.226]  George Humphrey's our guest.
[02:33:18.226 --> 02:33:22.569]  By the way, I want to just point out that he has made several documentary films and written a bunch of books.
[02:33:22.569 --> 02:33:28.273]  9-1-1, The Great Illusion by George Humphrey is an easy, quick read.
[02:33:28.273 --> 02:33:32.295]  It's a color booklet full of photographs and diagrams and graphics.
[02:33:32.295 --> 02:33:34.196]  This is one of the best books.
[02:33:34.196 --> 02:33:35.877]  And we sell these right at cost.
[02:33:35.877 --> 02:33:37.178]  I mean, these are super inexpensive.
[02:33:37.178 --> 02:33:39.900]  I forget what they are, like $5, $4 or something.
[02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:42.281]  We've got his film, 9-1-1, The Great Illusion.
[02:33:43.085 --> 02:33:44.685]  It's excellent.
[02:33:44.685 --> 02:33:51.006]  So again, it's all available at Infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:51.006 --> 02:33:56.007]  He's also a big part of our new film, Fall of the Republic.
[02:33:56.007 --> 02:33:57.648]  And here's some posters for you, George.
[02:33:57.648 --> 02:33:58.688]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:33:58.688 --> 02:34:01.408]  And as I told you, I'm going to frame this rascal.
[02:34:01.408 --> 02:34:04.209]  It's beautiful and put it in my office.
[02:34:04.209 --> 02:34:07.789]  And again, I was in the Obama deception and enjoyed that.
[02:34:07.789 --> 02:34:11.870]  In the Obama deception, the quality of the production was incredible.
[02:34:12.090 --> 02:34:13.391]  Incredible.
[02:34:13.391 --> 02:34:18.397]  And the fall of the republic is the professionalism that this is presented in is even better.
[02:34:19.295 --> 02:34:22.257]  I'm biased because I'm in the movie.
[02:34:42.513 --> 02:34:46.878]  Our sponsor, Acola Blue, with the Acola Blue 28 machine, will allow you to do just that.
[02:34:46.878 --> 02:34:50.742]  It's easy to use and it will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day.
[02:34:50.742 --> 02:34:54.786]  The water, once generated, passes through a seven-stage filter process.
[02:34:55.996 --> 02:35:03.238]  Including reverse osmosis and carbon filtration techniques ensuring that you know exactly what you are drinking.
[02:35:03.238 --> 02:35:05.319]  No chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride.
[02:35:05.319 --> 02:35:08.480]  We spend so much time talking about here on the radio broadcast.
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:21.405]  Get your very own source of unlimited renewable drinking water for you and your family today by visiting them on their website at ColaBlue.com or by clicking on their banners on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or give them a call today at 800-691-6043.
[02:35:26.270 --> 02:35:31.833]  And continuing with one other sponsor, efoodsdirect.com is non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[02:35:31.833 --> 02:35:34.215]  They have fully organic lines as well.
[02:35:34.215 --> 02:35:40.639]  They have different food lines for all different sorts of special diets that people are on.
[02:35:40.639 --> 02:35:43.500]  They have three-day, seven-day packs.
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:45.702]  It's all dehydrated so it's very easy to carry.
[02:35:45.702 --> 02:35:48.743]  The meals are 50% bigger than most other companies.
[02:35:48.743 --> 02:35:49.524]  It tastes great.
[02:35:50.284 --> 02:35:51.746]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:35:51.746 --> 02:35:54.988]  Everybody should have storable food so you're not dependent on the system.
[02:35:54.988 --> 02:35:56.309]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:57.630]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:35:57.630 --> 02:36:03.235]  Big banners up on InfoWars.com or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:36:03.235 --> 02:36:06.457]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own food, if you have your own bread.
[02:36:06.457 --> 02:36:10.981]  800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:36:10.981 --> 02:36:16.365]  Okay, George, I want to go through a bunch of subjects with you and then take some calls here while we have you today.
[02:36:18.104 --> 02:36:21.208]  On the subject of militarization of police, they're everywhere.
[02:36:21.208 --> 02:36:22.929]  They're giving people tickets for no reason.
[02:36:22.929 --> 02:36:34.302]  They're taking people's kids without due process, the CPS, the taxes, the bureaucracy, the state taxes, the international taxes, California and Oregon passing carbon taxes, the carbon tax.
[02:36:34.822 --> 02:36:39.526]  I have an article here from PrisonPlanet.com that has links to mainstream news, the Washington Post.
[02:36:39.526 --> 02:36:39.826]  U.S.
[02:36:39.826 --> 02:36:43.669]  military employs counterinsurgency strategy in California City.
[02:36:43.669 --> 02:36:53.137]  Former special forces colonel says violence hit town is a laboratory, as Washington Post advocates nationwide implementation of troops on the streets in America.
[02:36:53.137 --> 02:36:55.579]  This is really happening.
[02:36:55.579 --> 02:36:58.982]  I mean, this is real bonafide tyranny.
[02:36:58.982 --> 02:37:00.824]  Your take on that?
[02:37:00.824 --> 02:37:03.626]  Well, as they say, power tends to corrupt.
[02:37:04.369 --> 02:37:04.429]  And
[02:37:25.791 --> 02:37:37.462]  And the hundreds of thousands of other patriots around the country who are working for a better, freer, sovereign nation and world right now are getting the message out, and getting the message out very effectively.
[02:37:37.462 --> 02:37:40.025]  These people are freaking out.
[02:37:40.025 --> 02:37:47.172]  And they, the first thing that they think of is getting a bigger stick, trying to knock us down, trying to hit us, trying to control us.
[02:37:47.887 --> 02:37:52.591]  And of course, the police departments are the main place.
[02:37:52.591 --> 02:37:55.373]  Now, most of the cops don't know what's going on.
[02:37:55.373 --> 02:38:01.518]  Now, when I was a city council member, we still had peace officers.
[02:38:01.518 --> 02:38:03.800]  We had peace officers.
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:07.503]  And we had policemen that were there for the people of Austin.
[02:38:07.503 --> 02:38:16.410]  And as a matter of fact, it wasn't that long ago that police officers and peace officers wore blue and the sheriffs wore brown.
[02:38:17.884 --> 02:38:19.466]  And now they're all in black.
[02:38:19.466 --> 02:38:25.892]  I see that Maryland is just not Maryland, but Massachusetts, which is supposed to be the home of the most liberal people.
[02:38:26.553 --> 02:38:30.675]  And the country now have got all their police officers in all black.
[02:38:30.675 --> 02:38:31.675]  And they were in the news!
[02:38:31.675 --> 02:38:33.916]  The police chief said, this is to intimidate you.
[02:38:33.916 --> 02:38:35.616]  And it's like the Praetorian Guard.
[02:38:35.616 --> 02:38:37.997]  And again, history tends to repeat itself.
[02:38:37.997 --> 02:38:43.680]  And just like the Caesar, when it went from a republic to an empire, they created the Praetorian Guard.
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:46.681]  And the Praetorian Guard, of course, all wore all black.
[02:38:46.681 --> 02:38:51.042]  And that is a psychological way to create fear.
[02:38:51.042 --> 02:38:55.324]  And all of this is a choice between fear and love.
[02:38:55.953 --> 02:38:56.233]  We're
[02:39:14.156 --> 02:39:19.937]  In unity, consciousness, and cooperation, and be sovereign, and free, and love ourselves.
[02:39:19.937 --> 02:39:27.199]  First of all, love ourselves, and our family, and our world, and the good things that government can bring, such as the Constitution.
[02:39:27.199 --> 02:39:42.283]  Or whether we're going to close our eyes, and we're going to listen to these rascals, and all of their lies, and everything that they're saying to us, ABC, CBS, NBC, Time, Newsweek,
[02:39:42.742 --> 02:39:44.543]  You know, every place.
[02:39:44.543 --> 02:39:47.645]  It's all propaganda to create fear.
[02:39:47.645 --> 02:39:50.087]  Well, George, there's no longer any doubt.
[02:39:50.087 --> 02:39:53.590]  I mean, there was a checklist of 30 things that are tyranny.
[02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:55.711]  They've double-checked everything.
[02:39:55.711 --> 02:40:04.778]  It's now admitted, and this started decades ago, but that almost all TV is government-paid for, and they're writing the scripts with all these messages of tyranny.
[02:40:04.778 --> 02:40:12.003]  Including NPR, and for all my good liberal friends who still listen to NPR, wake up!
[02:40:12.543 --> 02:40:13.825]  That's the worst.
[02:40:13.825 --> 02:40:20.112]  Just because they say it with kind of a sweet... It's hypnotizing.
[02:40:20.112 --> 02:40:25.218]  It makes me physically ill to listen to those hypocrites.
[02:40:25.218 --> 02:40:26.580]  Physically ill.
[02:40:26.580 --> 02:40:29.103]  And I'll tell you what... Look at Obama expanding all the wars.
[02:40:31.586 --> 02:40:50.534]  Your first movie on this, The Obama Deception, you've got to underword the word deception because this guy, even though he's the most incredibly charismatic person who's been on the scene for the last 50 years, it's all about deception, deception, deception.
[02:40:50.534 --> 02:40:56.077]  Every single one of his promises, as you have pointed out again and again and again,
[02:40:57.509 --> 02:41:00.475]  He's gone 180 degrees apart.
[02:41:00.475 --> 02:41:03.662]  And I still see my friends who are, oh, Obama, Obama.
[02:41:03.662 --> 02:41:05.847]  And so I say, well, do you support the war?
[02:41:06.678 --> 02:41:16.985]  And they kind of shake a little bit, and most of them run off because they know that there's going to be an intelligent discussion because they're cognitive dissidents.
[02:41:16.985 --> 02:41:32.495]  And remember this term, cognitive dissidents, and it's something that we all have is that we invest our time, energy, or money in a concept is that when we find out that that concept is not right, psychologically we create barriers and fight against that.
[02:41:32.495 --> 02:41:35.617]  And that's what's called having an open mind and listening.
[02:41:36.181 --> 02:41:50.491]  And every single point that Obama made on the campaign trail, as you have so eloquently pointed out, and so factually pointed out, he's gone 180% against it.
[02:41:50.491 --> 02:41:58.396]  He is so far more of what is classically called a fascist than even George Bush.
[02:41:58.396 --> 02:42:01.659]  And people say, well, you're just a Republican.
[02:42:02.768 --> 02:42:05.892]  Four years ago, they were saying, you're just a Democrat.
[02:42:05.892 --> 02:42:08.334]  We're neither Democrat or Republican.
[02:42:08.334 --> 02:42:13.160]  We are American citizens who believe in the Constitution.
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:18.626]  This is not a question of right or left, it's a question of right or
[02:42:18.626 --> 02:42:19.546]  You're wrong.
[02:42:19.546 --> 02:42:20.746]  Do we want freedom?
[02:42:20.746 --> 02:42:21.907]  Do we want truth?
[02:42:21.907 --> 02:42:24.247]  Do we want a better America?
[02:42:24.247 --> 02:42:26.348]  Or are we going to be asleep?
[02:42:26.348 --> 02:42:30.668]  Well, the American people have not been taught in the last 30-40 years what tyranny is.
[02:42:30.668 --> 02:42:34.109]  And so they're told, here's freedom, but it's really tyranny.
[02:42:34.109 --> 02:42:38.550]  And then they tell the public, those of us that are for freedom, that we're the bad ones.
[02:42:38.550 --> 02:42:47.872]  I mean, I've had Salon, and all six of George Soros' big publications, and the New Republic, and the ADL, and CBS, and the Jerusalem Post,
[02:42:48.644 --> 02:42:55.493]  All in the last day, come out and say, no longer are they just ignoring me, or making fun of me, or just attacking me.
[02:42:55.493 --> 02:42:58.696]  They're now saying, we gotta shut this guy up, he's dangerous.
[02:42:58.696 --> 02:43:03.222]  And the reason they're now saying this is, they're watching our growth curve.
[02:43:03.222 --> 02:43:05.585]  But it's going straight up, and I say to them,
[02:43:06.574 --> 02:43:09.075]  I am trying to be loving.
[02:43:09.075 --> 02:43:10.115]  I know they're wrong.
[02:43:10.115 --> 02:43:11.595]  I know they're abusive.
[02:43:11.595 --> 02:43:13.096]  I know they're hurting my country.
[02:43:13.096 --> 02:43:14.796]  I know they're involved in evil.
[02:43:14.796 --> 02:43:18.897]  And I'm telling them now, and I'm going to look at them right now and tell them, you're in the wrong.
[02:43:18.897 --> 02:43:19.778]  You know you're bad.
[02:43:19.778 --> 02:43:20.998]  You know you're lying.
[02:43:20.998 --> 02:43:22.698]  You know you're using duplicity.
[02:43:22.698 --> 02:43:24.059]  You know the New World Order is real.
[02:43:25.777 --> 02:43:29.020]  And CBS wrote articles saying, I'm this big liar.
[02:43:29.020 --> 02:43:30.862]  I say they're setting up a world government.
[02:43:30.862 --> 02:43:32.924]  I mean, it's all over the news.
[02:43:32.924 --> 02:43:36.167]  Earlier on the show, I went over a bunch of mainstream... I mean, look at this.
[02:43:36.167 --> 02:43:37.228]  Financial Times of London.
[02:43:37.228 --> 02:43:39.290]  This is one of thousands in the last year.
[02:43:39.290 --> 02:43:40.952]  And now for world government.
[02:43:40.952 --> 02:43:43.614]  And this article says, we've lied to you for your own good.
[02:43:43.614 --> 02:43:44.455]  We're taking over.
[02:43:44.455 --> 02:43:45.396]  It's authoritarian.
[02:43:45.396 --> 02:43:46.097]  These are quotes.
[02:43:46.697 --> 02:43:48.379]  Here's another one.
[02:43:48.379 --> 02:43:54.544]  In here I've got the New York Times, Ban Ki-moon coming out and calling for world government and world taxes.
[02:43:54.544 --> 02:43:57.707]  This is what I'm saying, George.
[02:43:57.707 --> 02:43:59.849]  What is the ADL and CBS doing?
[02:43:59.849 --> 02:44:07.036]  What is Salon doing when they come out and say it's a conspiracy theory, there's no mercury in the shots when the insert says it?
[02:44:07.376 --> 02:44:13.543]  What are they doing when they say there's no world government, when it's simultaneously being announced by mainstream media as a good thing?
[02:44:13.543 --> 02:44:16.326]  It's almost like they want to destroy themselves.
[02:44:16.326 --> 02:44:17.647]  I mean, do they understand?
[02:44:17.647 --> 02:44:22.272]  Or are they so arrogant, and they think it's 20 years ago and people just bought whatever they said?
[02:44:23.007 --> 02:44:24.168]  Well, it's ad homily.
[02:44:24.168 --> 02:44:29.371]  What they're trying to do is they're trying to go after you as a person.
[02:44:29.371 --> 02:44:31.152]  And I know you.
[02:44:31.152 --> 02:44:36.755]  And for people who listen to Alex for the first time, and we've all gone through our Alex initiation.
[02:44:36.755 --> 02:44:40.857]  Alex rants and raves and he shouts and he raises his voice.
[02:44:40.857 --> 02:44:44.479]  And so many people say, I can't stand, he's just too intense.
[02:44:44.479 --> 02:44:47.021]  And I just say, listen to him for a week.
[02:44:47.501 --> 02:44:50.043]  Well, I don't want to talk about me, but...
[02:45:06.793 --> 02:45:09.596]  But he also has a heart of gold.
[02:45:09.596 --> 02:45:14.680]  As gruff and as grump as he sounds, he's a great guy.
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:28.512]  And what's more important is that for all the time I had my television show, I would invite hundreds of city officials, newscasters, people to come in and not debate, but just have a discussion about this.
[02:45:28.512 --> 02:45:30.133]  And I know you've done the same thing.
[02:45:30.133 --> 02:45:32.135]  And you would invite the top newscasters
[02:45:32.415 --> 02:45:32.735]  I don't
[02:45:49.853 --> 02:46:03.796]  Talking about our point of view and they want to separate everybody, of course, and it's all about that's why Chris Matthews and the folks on CNN on MSNBC They have that talking point that if you say I don't want socialist health care.
[02:46:03.796 --> 02:46:04.057]  They go.
[02:46:04.057 --> 02:46:04.977]  Why are you a racist?
[02:46:04.977 --> 02:46:08.138]  Yes, obviously, it's illogical It has nothing to do with that.
[02:46:08.138 --> 02:46:10.258]  They are invoking racism.
[02:46:10.258 --> 02:46:11.398]  They are the racist.
[02:46:11.398 --> 02:46:14.019]  They are the people using it as a political weapon
[02:46:14.499 --> 02:46:18.360]  And I'm sure that you would invite Chris or any of these... We have.
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:19.441]  We've called them all.
[02:46:19.441 --> 02:46:21.181]  And say, just come on down.
[02:46:21.181 --> 02:46:23.742]  Look, we're just gonna... We don't even have to debate.
[02:46:23.742 --> 02:46:25.342]  You can have your say.
[02:46:25.342 --> 02:46:26.423]  I'll have my say.
[02:46:26.423 --> 02:46:28.243]  No fighting back and forth.
[02:46:28.243 --> 02:46:30.204]  And let the people decide.
[02:46:30.204 --> 02:46:30.984]  But you know what?
[02:46:30.984 --> 02:46:33.665]  You've been doing this for years and years and years.
[02:46:34.275 --> 02:46:37.476]  And they won't do it, because they've got something to hide.
[02:46:37.476 --> 02:46:39.696]  They've got something to hide!
[02:46:39.696 --> 02:46:46.458]  And so folks who are listening, the people who are listening to this message right now, you are the power.
[02:46:46.458 --> 02:46:52.580]  If each and every one of you today can go out and talk to one person about this, and plant some seeds.
[02:46:52.580 --> 02:46:55.060]  Well tell them about Gandhi, because he has those quotes.
[02:46:55.060 --> 02:46:59.382]  He went around for 20 years just teaching people they had power, and then suddenly it all imploded.
[02:47:00.962 --> 02:47:12.689]  I go to India almost every year and I study in India and Mahatma Gandhi, I've been to his home, I've read him for years and years and years and he was a very, very bright man.
[02:47:12.689 --> 02:47:19.413]  He went to Oxford, he got his law degree, he went down to South Africa, he was very wealthy down there, but when he came back to India,
[02:47:20.356 --> 02:47:34.075]  There's about 350 million people living in India and about 300,000 British, and the British were in complete control of the Indian subcontinent, which at that time also included the nations of Pakistan,
[02:47:34.682 --> 02:47:35.682]  Kashmir.
[02:47:35.682 --> 02:47:39.204]  And Kashmir and the whole area.
[02:47:39.204 --> 02:47:54.991]  And 300,000 people were the sahibs of the whole nation because they had convinced the intellect, not the intellect, but the minds of the Indian people that they were beneath them and that the English were more powerful.
[02:47:54.991 --> 02:48:00.133]  And Gandhi came back and he realized that this was a fight
[02:48:00.776 --> 02:48:01.056]  We're good.
[02:48:14.739 --> 02:48:32.364]  Is that the seed of God is in the heart of every man, woman, and child, and that he was there to show through example that we could nurture the seed and that we were divine, sovereign beings, whether we were white, black, Asian.
[02:48:32.364 --> 02:48:38.846]  And when he got the Indian people to understand that they had value, that they had intellect, that they had rights,
[02:48:39.506 --> 02:48:43.391]  And his main thing was to get the British out still as friends.
[02:48:43.391 --> 02:48:45.334]  He didn't see them as enemies.
[02:48:45.334 --> 02:48:47.216]  He saw them as opponents.
[02:48:47.216 --> 02:48:50.020]  And he realized that they had wrong thinking.
[02:48:50.020 --> 02:48:53.825]  And he did this through hard work and through peace.
[02:48:53.825 --> 02:48:55.027]  And you know what folks?
[02:48:55.387 --> 02:48:58.889]  We can't beat the Illuminati right now with guns.
[02:48:58.889 --> 02:49:00.450]  We've got to do it with intellect.
[02:49:00.450 --> 02:49:01.871]  They want to make it a physical fight.
[02:49:01.871 --> 02:49:02.451]  Yes.
[02:49:02.451 --> 02:49:03.892]  Now, at the same time, we should defend ourselves.
[02:49:03.892 --> 02:49:04.792]  Of course.
[02:49:04.792 --> 02:49:06.533]  And Gandhi had something to say about that.
[02:49:06.533 --> 02:49:06.994]  Absolutely.
[02:49:06.994 --> 02:49:10.015]  Gandhi was no coward.
[02:49:10.015 --> 02:49:11.116]  Gandhi was a man.
[02:49:11.116 --> 02:49:12.137]  He let them beat him up all the time.
[02:49:12.137 --> 02:49:13.137]  He was a man's man.
[02:49:13.137 --> 02:49:19.601]  But he would say that it's better for a person to go to war and fight and die for their country
[02:49:20.296 --> 02:49:28.222]  Then to be a coward and hide under the banner of non-violent civil disobedience.
[02:49:28.222 --> 02:49:31.985]  Well, you gotta know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run.
[02:49:31.985 --> 02:49:33.606]  You gotta know when to play your cards.
[02:49:33.606 --> 02:49:38.710]  I mean, at points where there's police and they're just peacefully protesting, let them beat them up in front of people.
[02:49:38.710 --> 02:49:44.394]  Because that then shows people, but at the same time, if they're rounding up people in villages, taking them to FEMA camps,
[02:49:44.674 --> 02:49:45.535]  You gotta defend yourself.
[02:49:45.535 --> 02:50:00.624]  Absolutely, and for example, when what was going on in Russia was happening in the Ukraine, when Stalin was, you know, just decimating the Ukraine, Gandhi was very clear that it was important for those people to stand up and fight.
[02:50:00.624 --> 02:50:09.330]  He was no coward, and we encourage you not to be cowards, to see this thing as clearly
[02:50:10.077 --> 02:50:11.637]  Crystal clearly as possible.
[02:50:11.637 --> 02:50:17.179]  These people care not one iota about your freedom or your life.
[02:50:17.179 --> 02:50:20.219]  And so you need to protect yourself on all different fronts.
[02:50:20.219 --> 02:50:22.060]  But, but, but, but, don't be cowards.
[02:50:22.060 --> 02:50:22.900]  Get involved.
[02:50:22.900 --> 02:50:23.400]  Speak out.
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:23.680]  Exactly.
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:27.501]  You're not going to be able to physically fight if you can't even talk to your neighbor about this.
[02:50:27.501 --> 02:50:27.961]  Exactly.
[02:50:27.961 --> 02:50:28.641]  It's in increments.
[02:50:28.641 --> 02:50:29.322]  It's in steps.
[02:50:29.322 --> 02:50:35.343]  Yes, and it's through the first awareness, becoming aware of the massive illusion.
[02:50:35.743 --> 02:50:39.125]  The massive illusion of the... Yeah, don't just believe everything we're saying.
[02:50:39.125 --> 02:50:40.526]  Just realize you're being conned.
[02:50:40.526 --> 02:50:41.647]  There's more to the world.
[02:50:41.647 --> 02:50:42.127]  Yes.
[02:50:42.127 --> 02:51:00.097]  And then, as you become aware of the delusion and the manipulation on the third dimension, and then you become aware of what we call the second awareness, is that God, whatever you want to call God, the universal creator, the loving intelligence... We've got to go to break.
[02:51:00.097 --> 02:51:00.638]  We have to go to break.
[02:51:01.792 --> 02:51:03.794]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:51:03.794 --> 02:51:07.056]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:51:07.056 --> 02:51:11.480]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:20.707]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[02:51:20.707 --> 02:51:22.929]  Rely instead on OxySilver.
[02:51:22.929 --> 02:51:28.353]  OxySilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[02:51:28.633 --> 02:51:34.076]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[02:51:34.076 --> 02:51:39.059]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[02:51:39.059 --> 02:51:42.160]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.

[02:52:02.394 --> 02:52:06.396]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.396 --> 02:52:09.659]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.659 --> 02:52:11.060]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:11.767 --> 02:52:14.429]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.429 --> 02:52:20.835]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.835 --> 02:52:26.019]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.019 --> 02:52:29.301]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:29.301 --> 02:52:36.007]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.127 --> 02:52:38.467]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.467 --> 02:52:40.068]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.068 --> 02:52:42.508]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.508 --> 02:52:44.649]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.649 --> 02:52:49.790]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.790 --> 02:53:01.092]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.092 --> 02:53:02.892]  When you hear the words water purification,
[02:53:06.485 --> 02:53:06.925]  I think so.

[02:54:09.954 --> 02:54:25.777]  I want to go to calls, but George, you're making a really good point about how you read the New York Times, and it's all this well-woven together disinformation, rationales, and it's just a continual narrative of deception.
[02:54:25.777 --> 02:54:30.518]  It's a matrix of fraud, but when you know all the facts, then it's completely clear.
[02:54:30.518 --> 02:54:32.959]  But the average person, it's all written like it's reasonable.
[02:54:33.954 --> 02:54:34.975]  It's a fantasy land.
[02:54:34.975 --> 02:54:37.116]  It's like people with fantasy football.
[02:54:37.116 --> 02:54:39.738]  I mean, they're acting like they're really running quarterbacks.
[02:54:39.738 --> 02:54:41.780]  And on this little power trip, it's the same thing.
[02:54:41.780 --> 02:54:43.241]  They're all in this little box.
[02:54:43.241 --> 02:54:49.225]  Yeah, it's just absolutely amazing because I have been studying this stuff for a long, long time.
[02:54:49.845 --> 02:55:11.611]  And the other day I was reading the New York Times, which is the number one publication, and I start reading articles about cap-and-trade or the vaccines or whatever it was, and I just let myself read it like without my own point of view, and I realized how incredibly seductive and believable their point is.
[02:55:11.611 --> 02:55:15.452]  Because they'll mix a little truth in and have a smattering, yeah.
[02:55:16.272 --> 02:55:21.876]  And they do this so well, and as you say, this is the Matrix.
[02:55:21.876 --> 02:55:34.324]  And what we're facing is so similar to the movie The Matrix, the illusion out there is just deeper, deeper, deeper than almost any of us can understand.
[02:55:34.324 --> 02:55:38.006]  And we have to understand that to get through this period of time,
[02:55:39.107 --> 02:55:48.915]  And what the Mayan calendar calls 2012, or what the Rishis in India call the changing from the Kali Yuga to the Dwarpa Yuga.
[02:55:48.915 --> 02:55:51.036]  This has all been prophesized for a long time.
[02:55:51.036 --> 02:55:53.818]  Well, the elite believe there's a big change, but it's not going to be the end of the world.
[02:55:53.818 --> 02:55:59.682]  They believe they're bringing their system in, and they're actually trying to suppress people waking up because they know a big change is coming.
[02:55:59.682 --> 02:56:00.703]  Let's take some calls.
[02:56:00.703 --> 02:56:02.785]  Matthew in Arizona, you're on the air with George Humphrey.
[02:56:02.785 --> 02:56:03.085]  Go ahead.
[02:56:03.925 --> 02:56:18.673]  Hey Alex, you guys are doing great today, but I have something really important to bring up that I never really get, you know, I never really hear on your show and it's students at universities and how bad the liberal propaganda has been getting
[02:56:19.877 --> 02:56:23.739]  Well, we do talk about how they don't let people have free speech in a lot of universities.
[02:56:23.739 --> 02:56:25.020]  They bully the students.
[02:56:25.020 --> 02:56:25.941]  They call it liberal.
[02:56:25.941 --> 02:56:26.501]  It's not.
[02:56:26.501 --> 02:56:29.302]  It's really fascism.
[02:56:29.302 --> 02:56:30.903]  And it's anti-family.
[02:56:30.903 --> 02:56:32.224]  It's anti-male.
[02:56:32.224 --> 02:56:37.567]  They want to destroy the existing order so that everybody is basically destitute, institutionalized.
[02:56:38.447 --> 02:56:40.489]  And have to lean on the state, George?
[02:56:40.489 --> 02:56:44.712]  Well, when I think of liberal, I think of Thomas Jefferson.
[02:56:44.712 --> 02:56:52.818]  I think of somebody with an open mind, who is inquisitive, who is there, who wants to play by the rules, who has an open heart.
[02:56:52.818 --> 02:56:58.662]  To call these son-of-a-guns liberal, and we all have these friends who are liberal Democrats.
[02:56:58.662 --> 02:56:59.882]  Well, see, that's the matrix.
[02:56:59.882 --> 02:57:04.866]  They think they're Thomas Jefferson, the average liberal, when really they're working for a eugenics death cult.
[02:57:06.287 --> 02:57:17.096]  And the reality is that about 99% of the liberal Democrats in this country believe that they're doing the right thing.
[02:57:17.096 --> 02:57:18.818]  They think they're doing the right thing.
[02:57:18.818 --> 02:57:20.519]  They read the New York Times.
[02:57:20.519 --> 02:57:22.101]  They watch CNN.
[02:57:22.101 --> 02:57:24.463]  They've swallowed this lie.
[02:57:25.163 --> 02:57:26.704]  Hook, line, and sink.
[02:57:26.704 --> 02:57:32.848]  And they know their liberal paradigm isn't perfect, but it's better than that Republican paradigm, which is only another wing on the same bird.
[02:57:32.848 --> 02:57:33.648]  Thank you, Matthew.
[02:57:33.648 --> 02:57:35.109]  Don in Toronto, you're on the air.
[02:57:35.109 --> 02:57:36.550]  Go ahead, Don.
[02:57:36.550 --> 02:57:39.112]  Yes, hi, Alex, George.
[02:57:39.112 --> 02:57:43.995]  I'm calling from Canada, where the H1N1 massive vaccine campaign
[02:57:44.525 --> 02:57:51.589]  He's in full throttle right now and there have been reports of one person dying of complications apparently.
[02:57:51.589 --> 02:57:58.553]  There's a bunch of reports of deaths all over the world, China, France, England, and they're really covering most of them up.
[02:57:58.553 --> 02:58:06.418]  And I just wanted to ask you, George, you seem to see more police presence.
[02:58:07.197 --> 02:58:14.099]  In Mexico, the army is everywhere due to the fight against the drug cartels.
[02:58:14.099 --> 02:58:16.639]  The fight against drug dealers that aren't paying their cut.
[02:58:16.639 --> 02:58:20.460]  Does Georgia see increased militarization in North America?
[02:58:20.460 --> 02:58:21.600]  There's no question about it.
[02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:22.401]  It's already happening.
[02:58:22.401 --> 02:58:25.401]  Yeah, that's what we were just talking about.
[02:58:25.401 --> 02:58:29.662]  Yeah.
[02:58:29.662 --> 02:58:30.882]  We're going to go to break.
[02:58:30.882 --> 02:58:32.263]  Thank you so much, Don.
[02:58:32.263 --> 02:58:32.943]  Anything else?
[02:58:33.740 --> 02:58:40.710]  Well, I just wondered if, uh, if this H1N1 campaign goes any further, uh, and there's more deaths involved.
[02:58:40.710 --> 02:58:42.833]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:42.833 --> 02:58:44.095]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.095 --> 02:58:46.999]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.226 --> 02:58:58.977]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.

[02:59:26.045 --> 02:59:27.806]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:59:27.806 --> 02:59:30.326]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:59:30.326 --> 02:59:35.047]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.

[02:59:41.889 --> 02:59:43.789]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:59:43.789 --> 02:59:45.910]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:59:54.224 --> 02:59:56.586]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.586 --> 03:00:03.672]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:03.672 --> 03:00:10.138]  We are back live with George Humphrey in the studio with us for the final segment.
[03:00:23.286 --> 03:00:27.649]  Continuing with your phone calls, let's talk to Matt in the... Well, you know what?
[03:00:27.649 --> 03:00:30.892]  Don was asking about the H1N1 briefly.
[03:00:30.892 --> 03:00:34.175]  H1N1's being used to set up a medical tyranny, to set the precedent, to give us shots.
[03:00:34.175 --> 03:00:39.459]  They're now announcing, oh, you're gonna have to get a regular flu shot every year, and the, uh, swine flu.
[03:00:39.459 --> 03:00:40.640]  And boosters.
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:50.087]  And, you know, which is just... Look, even the Mayo Clinic, the Mayo Clinic, which is the most establishment organization in this country, is saying,
[03:00:50.896 --> 03:00:52.978]  I wouldn't take the shots.
[03:00:52.978 --> 03:00:54.579]  And those are moral decisions.
[03:00:54.579 --> 03:00:57.742]  These are establishment people that I guarantee are getting in trouble for this.
[03:00:57.742 --> 03:01:00.404]  Doctors are all over the world saying don't take it.
[03:01:00.404 --> 03:01:02.106]  And they still call us conspiracy theorists.
[03:01:02.106 --> 03:01:03.507]  That isn't going to hold water.
[03:01:03.507 --> 03:01:15.758]  You know, and the amazing thing is if you look back at the quote swine flu, it is not possible for an avian flu to coexist with the mammal flu.
[03:01:17.909 --> 03:01:24.232]  It just doesn't happen in nature, and this is clearly a man-made, genetically modified flu.
[03:01:24.232 --> 03:01:34.818]  And now that they're finding strains of the 1918 flu influenza, that they went up a couple years ago, they went up to Spitsberg, which is some islands north of Iceland.
[03:01:34.818 --> 03:01:37.339]  They're controlled by Norway, where they bury these people.
[03:01:37.899 --> 03:01:42.621]  And got strains of the flu from people who died up there.
[03:01:42.621 --> 03:01:46.022]  And it suddenly, and I remember eight years ago when they did that, it was in the news.
[03:01:46.022 --> 03:01:48.003]  We said, look out, they're gonna bring it back.
[03:01:48.003 --> 03:01:50.224]  And then now this dead flu is resurrected.
[03:01:50.754 --> 03:01:53.015]  You know, and I think it's going to be really interesting.
[03:01:53.015 --> 03:01:59.359]  I don't know what's happening in the Ukraine today, but about five or six days ago, they got a very virulent flu in the Ukraine.
[03:01:59.359 --> 03:02:05.463]  Well, their government is even admitting that they believe that all the different flu vaccines have mutated to form this.
[03:02:05.463 --> 03:02:05.923]  Yeah.
[03:02:05.923 --> 03:02:08.285]  And so we've got to keep our eye on it.
[03:02:08.285 --> 03:02:13.168]  But the most important thing is don't trust the vaccines.
[03:02:13.168 --> 03:02:14.068]  They don't help.
[03:02:14.068 --> 03:02:14.969]  They'll make you sick.
[03:02:15.267 --> 03:02:20.351]  There's people here, right here in Austin, Texas, that have taken it and who have become paralyzed.
[03:02:20.351 --> 03:02:21.532]  I know a whole bunch of people!
[03:02:21.532 --> 03:02:22.873]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:02:22.873 --> 03:02:28.058]  And so, the best way to protect yourself is to be healthy.
[03:02:28.058 --> 03:02:32.081]  To eat good, clean, organic, raw food.
[03:02:32.081 --> 03:02:32.841]  And a lot of sunshine.
[03:02:32.841 --> 03:02:34.143]  A lot of sunshine.
[03:02:34.143 --> 03:02:40.808]  Get that vitamin D and eat good, clean, organic fruits and vegetables.
[03:02:40.808 --> 03:02:42.449]  Let's take one more, or two more calls.
[03:02:42.449 --> 03:02:44.191]  Matt in the UK, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:02:45.856 --> 03:02:47.840]  Hi Alex and hi George, good afternoon.
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:55.394]  And by the way Alex, you are growing very rapidly in the UK by the way, so put your head up high, mate.
[03:02:55.394 --> 03:02:58.219]  Here's the problem, I have you make your point, but on the whole ADL subject...
[03:02:59.113 --> 03:03:05.475]  I want to get bigger to reach more people, but I'm almost like steaming towards my destruction, but I morally have to do it.
[03:03:05.475 --> 03:03:07.195]  It's not like, ooh, I'm getting big.
[03:03:07.195 --> 03:03:09.296]  I'm a celebrity now around the world.
[03:03:09.296 --> 03:03:11.977]  I mean, bigger and bigger.
[03:03:11.977 --> 03:03:15.458]  Media now, when they talk about conspiracies, just uses my name, Alex Jones.
[03:03:15.458 --> 03:03:17.558]  It's like a meme.
[03:03:17.558 --> 03:03:18.198]  I want to be honest.
[03:03:18.198 --> 03:03:19.819]  I don't like it, but thank you.
[03:03:19.819 --> 03:03:20.119]  Go ahead.
[03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:22.321]  Yeah, thank you Alex.
[03:03:22.321 --> 03:03:24.242]  Yeah, I have a banking question.
[03:03:24.242 --> 03:03:26.663]  Basically you mentioned about the US banking system.
[03:03:26.663 --> 03:03:30.025]  I'm going to tell you about the UK banking system at the moment.
[03:03:30.025 --> 03:03:36.189]  There's millions and millions of people trying to get back their bank charges and basically the banks aren't even budging.
[03:03:36.189 --> 03:03:39.951]  Shops are closing every day in the UK but the government keeps saying that growth is here.
[03:03:39.951 --> 03:03:41.012]  What do you guys reckon to that one?
[03:03:45.774 --> 03:03:52.439]  George, what's your take on the economy deteriorating, people losing their jobs, but the media is saying we've got a great economy?
[03:03:52.439 --> 03:04:03.046]  Well, it's very clear, is that in the last five years, consumer spending has represented 67-71% of the whole gross domestic national product.
[03:04:03.046 --> 03:04:06.088]  Now, and that was when the unemployment rate was about 4.5%.
[03:04:07.873 --> 03:04:11.576]  And the economy was basically humming along.
[03:04:11.576 --> 03:04:16.259]  Today, the unemployment, the official rates are 10.25% unemployment.
[03:04:16.259 --> 03:04:22.303]  The real number is somewhere between 14.5% to 17% unemployment.
[03:04:22.303 --> 03:04:23.684]  Those are the real numbers.
[03:04:23.684 --> 03:04:28.887]  And the people who are not fully employed, the amount of debt is not getting better.
[03:04:28.887 --> 03:04:30.869]  It's getting worse and worse and worse.
[03:04:31.329 --> 03:04:37.810]  We have a huge number of commercial banking mortgage bundles that will be coming up.
[03:04:37.810 --> 03:04:44.651]  The second round of residential bundles are coming up, which is what set this thing off in the first place.
[03:04:44.651 --> 03:04:45.511]  George, we're out of time.
[03:04:45.511 --> 03:04:47.792]  We got Catherine Austin Fitz on the line coming up.
[03:04:47.792 --> 03:04:48.772]  First time she's going to be on this.
[03:04:48.772 --> 03:04:50.152]  Very excited about that.
[03:04:50.152 --> 03:04:52.493]  And I'm sorry to Matt and others holding.
[03:04:52.493 --> 03:04:53.873]  You only get about 30 seconds on air.
[03:04:53.873 --> 03:04:54.653]  We just ran out of time.
[03:04:54.653 --> 03:04:55.853]  But thank you so much, Matt.
[03:04:55.853 --> 03:04:56.593]  Keep spreading the word.
[03:04:56.593 --> 03:04:57.774]  God bless you.
[03:04:57.774 --> 03:04:59.614]  Just kind of freaking me out, though, to realize that
[03:05:02.412 --> 03:05:06.436]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:05:06.436 --> 03:05:09.660]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:05:09.660 --> 03:05:14.465]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:05:14.465 --> 03:05:20.872]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:05:20.872 --> 03:05:23.115]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:05:23.635 --> 03:05:25.236]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:05:25.236 --> 03:05:26.397]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:05:26.397 --> 03:05:28.638]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:05:42.526 --> 03:05:44.388]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:05:44.388 --> 03:05:49.812]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:05:49.812 --> 03:05:58.940]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:00.982 --> 03:06:10.129]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:06:10.129 --> 03:06:13.511]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:06:13.511 --> 03:06:19.376]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:06:19.376 --> 03:06:24.159]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:06:24.159 --> 03:06:26.501]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:06:26.681 --> 03:06:27.081]  Thank you.
[03:06:43.430 --> 03:06:43.630]  Thank you.
[03:07:01.687 --> 03:07:04.689]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:04.689 --> 03:07:10.014]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:07:10.014 --> 03:07:12.075]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:07:12.075 --> 03:07:17.079]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:17.079 --> 03:07:17.980]  How much do you want?
[03:07:18.240 --> 03:07:19.361]  When do you want it?
[03:07:19.361 --> 03:07:21.242]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:07:21.242 --> 03:07:22.322]  When will you need it?
[03:07:22.322 --> 03:07:24.523]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:07:24.523 --> 03:07:25.864]  Will there be any food?
[03:07:25.864 --> 03:07:27.385]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:07:27.385 --> 03:07:32.667]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:07:32.667 --> 03:07:36.249]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:07:36.249 --> 03:07:39.711]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:07:40.071 --> 03:07:41.291]  How much will you need?
[03:07:41.291 --> 03:07:42.192]  We don't know.
[03:07:42.192 --> 03:07:43.292]  How much do you want?
[03:07:43.292 --> 03:07:44.212]  All you can get.
[03:07:44.212 --> 03:07:45.312]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:07:45.312 --> 03:07:48.373]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:07:48.373 --> 03:07:50.134]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:07:50.134 --> 03:07:51.054]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:08:03.706 --> 03:08:09.089]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:09.089 --> 03:08:11.350]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:11.350 --> 03:08:20.295]  Okay, I've got a correction to make.
[03:08:20.295 --> 03:08:30.540]  I've been announcing this is the first time that Catherine Austen Fitch has been on, but she reminded me that about eight years ago or so, she was on the show.
[03:08:30.540 --> 03:08:31.841]  But for all intents and purposes,
[03:08:32.691 --> 03:08:38.234]  It's not her first rodeo, but this is a maiden voyage in the last eight years.
[03:08:38.234 --> 03:08:41.355]  So it is good, good to have her with us.
[03:08:41.355 --> 03:08:46.077]  But I guess if your memory's wiped and you don't remember something, it is a maiden voyage.
[03:08:46.077 --> 03:08:56.942]  Katherine Austin Fitz, founder and managing member of Solari Investment Advisory Services, LLC, president of the Hamilton Securities Group Investment Bank and financial software developer, assistant secretary of housing,
[03:08:57.904 --> 03:09:01.405]  Federal Housing Commissioner, under Bush I, Managing Director.
[03:09:01.405 --> 03:09:06.226]  Managing Director and member of the board of the Wall Street firm, Dillon Reed & Co, Inc.
[03:09:06.226 --> 03:09:07.486]  Doesn't get any more elite than that.
[03:09:07.486 --> 03:09:16.628]  Catherine has designed and closed over $25 billion in transactions and investments to date, and has led portfolio strategy for $300 billion of financial assets and liabilities.
[03:09:16.628 --> 03:09:18.548]  Solari.com is the website.
[03:09:18.548 --> 03:09:20.749]  S-O-L-A-R-I dot com.
[03:09:20.749 --> 03:09:26.190]  We're very honored to have her here, and hopefully we can start having her every few months instead of every decade or so.
[03:09:26.690 --> 03:09:32.392]  And I want her to just tell you a little bit about herself, her journey, her voyage, for the few of you that don't know who she is.
[03:09:32.392 --> 03:09:34.753]  She's on TV, radio, a lot over the years.
[03:09:34.753 --> 03:09:41.515]  And then I want to get into what we're facing as a society, what the elites are doing, her take on Obama.
[03:09:41.515 --> 03:09:44.355]  And it's great to have Catherine Austin Fitz on with us today.
[03:09:44.355 --> 03:09:45.356]  Catherine?
[03:09:45.356 --> 03:09:46.716]  Alex, it's always a pleasure.
[03:09:46.716 --> 03:09:49.377]  As you know, I'm a huge fan of you and InfoWars.
[03:09:50.427 --> 03:10:01.231]  Well, I guess I'd forgotten that fact, but it's... I've been emailing you for a while, but maybe emailing the wrong email trying to get you on, and I was crestfallen, but I'm a big fan of you.
[03:10:01.231 --> 03:10:02.171]  You've got the floor.
[03:10:02.171 --> 03:10:05.013]  Break down what you think is most important, but first tell us about yourself.
[03:10:05.013 --> 03:10:11.455]  Well, I came out of the Bush administration thinking, oh my word, the fascists are going to kill us all, we need to do something.
[03:10:11.455 --> 03:10:16.697]  And I started an investment bank in Washington, and our goal was to help communities
[03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:32.277]  Finance with equity, because rather than shipping all of our money to Wall Street and then hoping a little bit trickles back, or shipping it all to Washington and hoping a little trickles back, my theory was how about if we, you know, if we financed our own businesses and did much more locally.
[03:10:32.277 --> 03:10:34.578]  So I started an investment bank.
[03:10:34.578 --> 03:10:40.722]  One of the things we did was we were hired on competitive bid to be financial advisor to the U.S.
[03:10:40.722 --> 03:10:45.244]  Department of Housing and Urban Development, where I'd worked as an assistant secretary, and I
[03:10:47.743 --> 03:10:52.127]  We did loan sales, Alex, and they were unbelievably successful.
[03:10:52.127 --> 03:10:55.449]  It was during the Clinton administration.
[03:10:55.449 --> 03:10:57.131]  But the corruption got worse and worse.
[03:10:57.131 --> 03:10:59.553]  Now, you know, it was terrible in the Bush administration.
[03:10:59.553 --> 03:11:02.195]  It just kept getting worse in the Clinton administration.
[03:11:02.195 --> 03:11:08.460]  And we were, a decision was made, I was part of a group of people who were saying, oh my goodness,
[03:11:09.844 --> 03:11:18.809]  With GATT and NAFTA, we're going to ship all the jobs abroad, and we need to do something or else the American people are going to be left high and dry.
[03:11:18.809 --> 03:11:20.130]  The middle class will be wiped out.
[03:11:20.130 --> 03:11:23.052]  How are we going to develop new skills?
[03:11:23.052 --> 03:11:27.914]  How are we going to help people create new jobs and support small business?
[03:11:27.914 --> 03:11:30.596]  We're part of a group that we're working on all of that.
[03:11:31.283 --> 03:11:44.317]  And literally a decision was made, rather than address the real problems and help the American people jump the curve on the situation, that instead we would bubble the economy and pull massive amounts of capital and reinvest them abroad.
[03:11:45.544 --> 03:11:50.108]  So this was a conscious decision and you were there on the inside witnessing this?
[03:11:50.108 --> 03:11:50.929]  Absolutely.
[03:11:50.929 --> 03:12:07.026]  And I'll tell you the greatest, one of the best videos I've ever seen, you can get it up on my blog at polari.com flash blog, is Sir James Goldsmith did a speaking tour trying to stop the gap from being passed in the World Trade Organization to be adopted.
[03:12:07.794 --> 03:12:11.438]  And basically said this is the most frightening, terrifying thing we're going to have.
[03:12:11.438 --> 03:12:14.981]  3 billion people moved off the land.
[03:12:14.981 --> 03:12:17.303]  Massive unemployment worldwide.
[03:12:17.303 --> 03:12:22.848]  We're going to destroy, we're going to have massive structural unemployment in the United States.
[03:12:22.848 --> 03:12:30.556]  He gave this interview, it's up on YouTube, to Charlie Rose in 1995 and he predicts everything that's happening now.
[03:12:31.283 --> 03:12:39.729]  Now, remember, this man's a billionaire, very successful businessman, and basically said, look, this is the establishment against everybody else.
[03:12:39.729 --> 03:12:44.152]  And he said, this is going to be the most devastating, horrible thing that has ever happened to the world.
[03:12:44.152 --> 03:12:46.034]  It's absolutely crazy.
[03:12:46.034 --> 03:12:49.076]  And he lays it all out.
[03:12:49.076 --> 03:12:50.897]  And so I can say the same thing.
[03:12:50.897 --> 03:12:52.619]  We were on the inside.
[03:12:52.619 --> 03:12:54.240]  We're working with the administration.
[03:12:54.992 --> 03:12:58.335]  And we knew that we were going to create massive unemployment.
[03:12:58.335 --> 03:13:04.019]  Now, here's the big secret of the work that I did when I was in Washington during that period.
[03:13:04.019 --> 03:13:15.087]  We created something, Alex, called Community Wizard, which was a software tool that would allow us to look at the sources and uses of government money by place, because America's just 3,100 counties.
[03:13:15.087 --> 03:13:19.930]  And when you look at government investment by place, what you discover is that
[03:13:21.175 --> 03:13:37.447]  That a great deal of money is being spent to centralize economic and political power and to basically subsidize large corporations and all sorts of unproductive behavior, whether it's people on welfare all the way up to corporations on welfare.
[03:13:37.447 --> 03:13:39.108]  But let me give you a couple examples.
[03:13:39.108 --> 03:13:47.695]  We would regularly find places where HUD was spending, this is HUD, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was spending $250,000
[03:13:50.020 --> 03:13:58.767]  to construct or rehab an apartment building when $50,000 would buy and rehab a foreclosed single-family property.
[03:13:58.767 --> 03:14:04.191]  So we were spending four or five times what we needed to to get one.
[03:14:04.191 --> 03:14:11.818]  And I went to the assistant, to the person who ran that program in 1996, and said, look, you know, we could get five homes for the price of one.
[03:14:11.818 --> 03:14:16.001]  And they looked at me, turned bright red, and said, but how would we generate fees for our friends?
[03:14:18.502 --> 03:14:29.566]  Now, imagine, if you will, imagine how many more people would have homes today if we weren't doing things like that.
[03:14:29.566 --> 03:14:36.029]  It was just a giant honeypot, and the media loves to always blame poor people who were told, oh, it's the new America!
[03:14:36.029 --> 03:14:43.392]  It's the way to build wealth, build equity, go out from the banks down to the assessors.
[03:14:43.392 --> 03:14:45.933]  We're all going to basically cheat on the forms.
[03:14:45.933 --> 03:14:47.854]  The media advertised it was okay to do.
[03:14:48.474 --> 03:14:51.255]  And then the media now tries to blame the poor people.
[03:14:51.255 --> 03:14:57.397]  They got set up and ripped off and given these arms and these balloon mortgages.
[03:14:57.397 --> 03:15:08.841]  That's like, my analogy, Catherine Austin Fitz, is like blaming a six-year-old that doesn't mind their parents, gets out of the backyard, goes in the front yard, and a man has a puppy and candy.
[03:15:09.421 --> 03:15:13.684]  In a van, and they get in the car and get taken away and raped and killed.
[03:15:13.684 --> 03:15:15.525]  You don't blame the five-year-old.
[03:15:15.525 --> 03:15:16.806]  You blame the banks.
[03:15:16.806 --> 03:15:18.167]  You blame the killer.
[03:15:18.167 --> 03:15:20.449]  You blame the people that set this in motion.
[03:15:20.449 --> 03:15:24.491]  Well, in fact, it's called, under the law, it's called fraudulent inducement.
[03:15:24.491 --> 03:15:35.579]  If I encourage you to, if I'm a lender and I encourage you to take on a loan, and I know something about your future financial condition that you don't,
[03:15:36.542 --> 03:15:42.965]  Then that is fraudulent inducement, and you may not be obligated to pay me back for all or a portion.
[03:15:42.965 --> 03:15:54.010]  So, in fact, what happened was, if you look at the big, you know, the largest banks and the largest people leading the mortgage business, everything that I knew then, they knew.
[03:15:54.010 --> 03:16:00.573]  I mean, this was all known in Washington, that the jobs were going to go abroad, and incomes were generally going to fall.
[03:16:01.266 --> 03:16:10.573]  And so what they were doing was they were encouraging people to take out loans, many of whom thought they could pay back, and didn't know that their income was going to be falling.
[03:16:10.573 --> 03:16:12.534]  Let's jump forward, then we'll go back.
[03:16:12.534 --> 03:16:13.955]  But let's jump forward.
[03:16:13.955 --> 03:16:30.347]  Greg Gordon's four-part series now on McClatchy Newspapers, he got the internal documents of what you've already publicly stated and others have stated, that the pilots, that pilot the private fellow reserve and all the major regulatory positions, Goldman Sachs,
[03:16:31.087 --> 03:16:44.012]  We're telling everybody to invest in housing, selling these securities, while at the same time betting against them to destroy their competitors and vertically integrate the market.
[03:16:44.012 --> 03:16:50.014]  To them, making everybody destitute or a lower standard of living, that's great vertical integration.
[03:16:50.014 --> 03:16:57.757]  That's like a mosquito jamming their proboscis into your arm, pumping in enzymes to liquidate the cells so they can slurp them up.
[03:16:57.757 --> 03:16:59.058]  I mean, this is just a parasite.
[03:16:59.618 --> 03:17:03.920]  Remember, these firms no longer see themselves as serving clients.
[03:17:03.920 --> 03:17:09.383]  They see themselves as trading for their own account and being part of syndicates, which includes the U.S.
[03:17:09.383 --> 03:17:12.764]  government, which engage in economic warfare.
[03:17:12.764 --> 03:17:18.527]  And when they engage in economic warfare and when they trade for their own account, they're using the federal credit to do it.
[03:17:20.583 --> 03:17:25.067]  You know, if they lose money, we print paper and dig them out.
[03:17:25.067 --> 03:17:27.290]  And if they don't lose money, they get to keep it.
[03:17:27.290 --> 03:17:30.493]  It's sort of win-you-win and lose-you-win.
[03:17:30.493 --> 03:17:31.574]  So what's the endgame?
[03:17:31.574 --> 03:17:39.461]  And I want to go back over the history of this and more of where we're going, and I want you to lead the discussion throughout the rest of the hour, Catherine Austen-Fitz.
[03:17:39.461 --> 03:17:45.007]  But, I mean, specifically, that you're agreeing that it's premeditated,
[03:17:45.806 --> 03:17:48.188]  And Predatory, what's the endgame?
[03:17:48.188 --> 03:17:56.535]  What we're watching, and it started in, the latest phase started in 1995 with the institution of the World Trade Organization.
[03:17:56.535 --> 03:18:03.561]  What we're watching is a fundamental re-engineering of how resources on planet Earth are governed.
[03:18:03.561 --> 03:18:10.867]  So we're moving from a model where places are governed by governments, by sovereign governments,
[03:18:12.070 --> 03:18:26.857]  To a world where resources are managed by multinational corporations under the auspices of a world government that operates very much through the financial system and the central banking system.
[03:18:26.857 --> 03:18:32.179]  And if you look at the economic model that it's using, it's not really a new model.
[03:18:32.179 --> 03:18:34.660]  It's called central banking warfare.
[03:18:34.660 --> 03:18:36.401]  So the central banks print money.
[03:18:37.040 --> 03:18:40.184]  And the military makes sure that people take it.
[03:18:40.184 --> 03:18:53.483]  What's important to understand now, which is not common in any analysis of the economy, is that the United States and its allies have created a global taxation system.
[03:18:54.545 --> 03:19:06.913]  And the way it works, Alex, is we print paper, whether it's dollar bills or treasuries, and then other governments around the world, or central banks around the world, buy that paper, and the paper goes down in value.
[03:19:07.731 --> 03:19:10.993]  So it's a taxation system through the balance sheet.
[03:19:10.993 --> 03:19:12.334]  No legislature.
[03:19:12.334 --> 03:19:18.818]  You know, every country in the world hasn't passed a law saying, okay, we're going to pay a 5% tithe to the United States Empire every year.
[03:19:18.818 --> 03:19:21.720]  But in fact, that's what's happening through the currency system.
[03:19:21.720 --> 03:19:25.762]  And now by the devaluation, the tax is increasing.
[03:19:25.762 --> 03:19:26.423]  Right.
[03:19:26.423 --> 03:19:27.884]  The tax is increasing.
[03:19:27.884 --> 03:19:32.066]  And what we're watching just in the last two weeks with various people around the world squawking is
[03:19:33.433 --> 03:19:43.820]  They're squawking because the subsidy that needs to be extracted every year is greater and greater, and the pain of the taxation as the economy slows down is greater and greater.
[03:19:43.820 --> 03:19:44.660]  Unbelievable.
[03:19:44.660 --> 03:19:47.162]  Continue breaking down this global government architecture.
[03:19:47.162 --> 03:19:50.885]  When you were talking about this ten years ago, the media would still pooh-pooh it.
[03:19:50.885 --> 03:19:59.990]  Now they're admitting world government is here, but simultaneously, if you then say, oh, I don't want to be part of it, they say, this person's insane, it doesn't exist.
[03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:01.111]  I want to get your take on that.
[03:20:01.111 --> 03:20:01.772]  Amazing.
[03:20:03.137 --> 03:20:04.878]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[03:20:04.878 --> 03:20:08.682]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[03:20:08.682 --> 03:20:13.526]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[03:20:13.526 --> 03:20:19.231]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.

[03:20:57.968 --> 03:21:00.508]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[03:21:03.021 --> 03:21:07.047]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:07.047 --> 03:21:10.292]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:10.292 --> 03:21:11.714]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:21:12.412 --> 03:21:15.093]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:15.093 --> 03:21:21.475]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.475 --> 03:21:27.017]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:27.017 --> 03:21:36.641]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.761 --> 03:21:39.122]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:39.122 --> 03:21:40.702]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.702 --> 03:21:43.163]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:43.163 --> 03:21:45.284]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:45.284 --> 03:21:50.446]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:03.430]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:22:03.430 --> 03:22:08.955]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:22:08.955 --> 03:22:09.495]  I get it.
[03:22:09.495 --> 03:22:19.124]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:22:19.124 --> 03:22:20.525]  That's not what's happening.
[03:22:20.525 --> 03:22:24.909]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[03:22:25.109 --> 03:22:26.951]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value?
[03:22:26.951 --> 03:22:28.993]  Or that your retirement would be secure?
[03:22:28.993 --> 03:22:32.376]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:22:32.376 --> 03:22:36.660]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:22:36.660 --> 03:22:38.261]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:22:38.261 --> 03:22:42.225]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[03:22:42.225 --> 03:22:46.048]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:22:46.048 --> 03:22:46.949]  You should too.

[03:24:39.954 --> 03:24:44.217]  Links up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:24:44.217 --> 03:24:46.799]  Of course, we're simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[03:24:46.799 --> 03:24:49.121]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[03:24:49.121 --> 03:24:49.521]  Catherine,
[03:24:50.649 --> 03:25:13.487]  I'm going to try to just sit back and let you roll now, because I want to hear what you think is most important and where all this is going and how we protect ourselves, but just to realize that open world government's being established, a financial predatory dictatorship that wants us poor and easily controlled, openly being stated, a fake green tyranny, all of this is being set up, and we're not even having a national debate about it.
[03:25:13.487 --> 03:25:17.490]  They're just announcing with one hand, world government is here and it's good,
[03:25:19.108 --> 03:25:23.671]  And then, with the other hand saying, if you talk about it, you're a dangerous kook, it doesn't exist.
[03:25:23.671 --> 03:25:26.593]  Can you talk about that?
[03:25:26.593 --> 03:25:31.737]  Well, I, you know, I don't, I don't know anybody who says you're a kook if you talk about that.
[03:25:31.737 --> 03:25:34.219]  I mean, I never get called a kook.
[03:25:34.219 --> 03:25:40.343]  No, no, I know you don't get called a kook by the public because Ban Ki-Moons and the New York Times calling for global governance, but...
[03:25:41.274 --> 03:25:42.875]  Well, here's an example since you said it.
[03:25:42.875 --> 03:25:50.581]  I had CBS News, Jerusalem Post, ADL, Salon yesterday all attack me and say I'm insane.
[03:25:50.581 --> 03:25:51.802]  None of it exists.
[03:25:51.802 --> 03:25:59.787]  Well, you know, Planet Earth divides up into what I call the pro-centralization team and the pro-decentralization team.
[03:25:59.787 --> 03:26:01.469]  And if you look at how the money works, Alex,
[03:26:02.102 --> 03:26:08.986]  The economy has been steadily centralizing more and more money, and so more and more people are on the dole.
[03:26:08.986 --> 03:26:12.428]  They're on the payroll of the pro-centralization team.
[03:26:12.428 --> 03:26:18.892]  So, you know, when somebody is making money on something, attacks me for, you know, in whatever way.
[03:26:18.892 --> 03:26:24.435]  I mean, in Washington, we used to just call them the attack poodles.
[03:26:24.435 --> 03:26:28.057]  So when the attack poodles you tell you you're crazy, that's what they're paid to do.
[03:26:28.057 --> 03:26:28.898]  You know, it's a game.
[03:26:28.898 --> 03:26:29.478]  It's not real.
[03:26:30.507 --> 03:26:32.409]  And they know they're lying!
[03:26:32.409 --> 03:26:33.750]  Yeah, they know.
[03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:40.655]  One of the things that's so amazing to me is you see more and more people just, you know, they can't keep a straight face even when they're saying it.
[03:26:40.655 --> 03:26:45.999]  I was watching the clip this morning of the Attorney General announcing the Financial Fraud Task Force.
[03:26:45.999 --> 03:26:47.560]  I mean, talk about projection!
[03:26:47.560 --> 03:26:56.086]  So, you know, and he literally, it looked to me like he couldn't keep a straight face.
[03:26:56.086 --> 03:26:59.048]  So, you know, these guys know it, but you know it's a game.
[03:27:00.336 --> 03:27:09.003]  And the rest of us are on the pro-decentralization team, and part of the challenge is we have not yet created a vision of where the alternative is.
[03:27:09.003 --> 03:27:16.029]  And let me talk about one of the places that we're stuck, because this is so, so important.
[03:27:16.029 --> 03:27:19.192]  You probably don't know my very famous red-button story.
[03:27:19.192 --> 03:27:28.179]  I was giving a speech to a group of people called Spiritual Frontiers Foundation International, and they have a conference once a year, Alex.
[03:27:28.846 --> 03:27:34.231]  Where they go and sit in the woods for a couple days and talk about how they can help our society evolve spiritually.
[03:27:34.231 --> 03:27:45.060]  So a friend of mine had asked me to give them a speech called, How the Money Works in Organized Crime, and it later became a very famous article called, Narco Dollars for Beginners, and it's designed... Yes, I've read it.
[03:27:45.060 --> 03:27:45.340]  Right.
[03:27:45.340 --> 03:27:51.445]  It's designed to explain the intersection of narcotics trafficking, organized crime, and government and big corporations.
[03:27:51.445 --> 03:27:54.928]  Anyway, so Wall Street in Washington does drug money.
[03:27:55.992 --> 03:28:10.056]  So I'm in the middle of the speech and I'm explaining the fact, we're talking about the Dark Alliance allegations and the two hearings that Congress had on CIA drug dealing in South Central LA.
[03:28:10.056 --> 03:28:15.937]  And I mentioned at the time a reporter that I was helping was told by the Department of Justice that the U.S.
[03:28:15.937 --> 03:28:23.699]  economy launders $500 billion to a trillion dollars a year, $500 billion to a trillion of all dirty money, so that's narcotics trafficking.
[03:28:24.702 --> 03:28:25.423]  I don't know.
[03:28:32.990 --> 03:28:33.871]  We're good to go.
[03:28:57.330 --> 03:29:09.895]  And if you push that button, you can stop all hard narcotics trafficking in your county, your state, your country tomorrow, thus offending the people who control 500 billion to a trillion dollars a year.
[03:29:09.895 --> 03:29:11.775]  Who here will push the button?
[03:29:11.775 --> 03:29:13.416]  And this was the summer of 2000.
[03:29:13.416 --> 03:29:20.058]  Out of 100 people dedicated to evolving our society spiritually, guess how many would push the button?
[03:29:20.058 --> 03:29:21.279]  How many?
[03:29:21.279 --> 03:29:21.359]  One.
[03:29:22.486 --> 03:29:24.628]  One would push the button, the other 99 would not.
[03:29:24.628 --> 03:29:26.229]  I said, why would you not push the button?
[03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:30.612]  They said, we don't want our government checks to stop and we don't want our mutual funds to go down.
[03:29:30.612 --> 03:29:31.693]  And that's the trap.
[03:29:31.693 --> 03:29:34.435]  That's how evil gets you dependent on them.
[03:29:34.435 --> 03:29:38.378]  And the police all know the government brings in most of the drugs, but they just...
[03:29:39.204 --> 03:29:43.405]  They have to keep buying the delusion of busting kids and putting them in prison.
[03:29:43.405 --> 03:29:50.707]  If you decriminalize the drugs, the money would dry up, the crime would leave it, and the ODing would stop, and the drug abuse would plunge.
[03:29:50.707 --> 03:29:52.387]  All the studies prove it.
[03:29:52.387 --> 03:29:53.788]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.788 --> 03:29:56.308]  The Empire's on the run.

[03:32:00.839 --> 03:32:06.145]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:32:06.145 --> 03:32:10.690]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?

[03:33:13.379 --> 03:33:15.000]  Solari.com's the website.
[03:33:15.000 --> 03:33:17.943]  Her name is Katherine Austin-Fitz.
[03:33:17.943 --> 03:33:26.250]  She was one of the top people at HUD, managing director and member of the board of Wall Street firm Dylan Reed & Co.
[03:33:26.250 --> 03:33:37.260]  She's designed and closed over 25 billion of transactions and investments to date, and has led portfolio strategy for 300 billion of financial assets and liabilities, and we're just really honored to have her with us.
[03:33:39.736 --> 03:33:51.840]  Okay Catherine, we ran into that break and you were breaking down the centralization team versus the decentralization team or team tyranny versus team liberty.
[03:33:51.840 --> 03:33:53.781]  There's so many facets in this.
[03:33:53.781 --> 03:33:57.543]  How far along is this new form of world government?
[03:33:57.543 --> 03:34:01.244]  Describe some of that world government to us and then get into whatever subjects you want to cover.
[03:34:01.244 --> 03:34:06.586]  Solutions, how you think people can individually protect themselves, strategies for states and counties.
[03:34:07.605 --> 03:34:13.650]  Okay, well let me jump back for a second to the history of what I call the black budget.
[03:34:13.650 --> 03:34:16.552]  Because you really need to understand the history of this.
[03:34:16.552 --> 03:34:20.656]  People don't understand how it could have gotten so bad and may not notice.
[03:34:20.656 --> 03:34:22.117]  What happened, Alex, was in 1947 and 1949.
[03:34:25.126 --> 03:34:37.132]  We passed the National Security Act and the CIA Act, and those two acts in combination allowed money to be clawed out of the federal government and federal budget and spent in non-transparent ways.
[03:34:37.132 --> 03:34:43.315]  So we created a secret way of funding very big projects through the governmental mechanism.
[03:34:43.315 --> 03:34:46.557]  Now remember, they can borrow as much money as they want.
[03:34:47.290 --> 03:35:05.923]  And then something else happened, because if you go back and you look at the history of financial fraud and the kind of corruption we're looking at, and you interview or you research and you read the people sort of dealing with it, it all comes back to a point after World War II where literally the government lost control of the technology.
[03:35:05.923 --> 03:35:13.409]  We had the most powerful, secretive black technology in the world, including some that we brought over from the Nazis.
[03:35:14.139 --> 03:35:21.344]  And literally, we've created this funding mechanism that paid corporations to control and manage technology.
[03:35:21.344 --> 03:35:36.996]  And a lot of what we're dealing with goes back to the fact that we've had, since then, 50 to 60 years of incredible, non-transparent governmental flows going into, basically, corporate-controlled technology that many of us don't understand.
[03:35:38.203 --> 03:35:46.952]  And when you say, well, how can the military force countries all around the world to take paper that keeps going down in value?
[03:35:46.952 --> 03:35:57.824]  It all comes back, as you probably note, a lot of the invisible weaponry, the satellite systems, and all this incredible technology that we don't understand and know about.
[03:35:59.952 --> 03:36:07.642]  I mean they bragged that they're really 30 years advanced and they've got satellites where they can radiate somebody from space.
[03:36:07.642 --> 03:36:15.634]  I mean we have a highly advanced technocracy that has walled itself off in military reservations, private
[03:36:16.243 --> 03:36:29.871]  Corporate reservations, as you know, is heading up a big company that developed a lot of financial software systems, and they've rolled out the internet systems, the banking systems, the cashless systems that have now just been adopted.
[03:36:29.871 --> 03:36:37.376]  It's like poisoning the well, poisoning the water hole, and the deer come to it and drink and then go off and die and don't even know what killed them.
[03:36:38.116 --> 03:36:43.178]  It's just like all the technology to track and control us is built into the iPhone or the cell phone.
[03:36:43.178 --> 03:36:51.500]  We just accept it, and we're now basically like savages in this 21st century Buck Rogers system, not even knowing what we're part of.
[03:36:51.500 --> 03:36:59.602]  And the elite, as Bill Joy wrote in the April issue in 2000 in Wired Magazine, the elite don't need us anymore.
[03:36:59.602 --> 03:37:01.403]  Why the future doesn't need us?
[03:37:01.403 --> 03:37:02.463]  Well, it's worse than that.
[03:37:02.463 --> 03:37:05.184]  Not only do they not need us, but we've become very expensive.
[03:37:06.411 --> 03:37:08.993]  I mean, let's just look at the numbers in the United States.
[03:37:08.993 --> 03:37:19.181]  In the United States, if you look at the national debt before the bank bailout, each American had about $38,000 of national debt.
[03:37:19.181 --> 03:37:31.190]  If you count up the Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid and other contingent liabilities, and you say, what's the present value of those contingent liabilities, it's about $138,000, so more than, say, four times the current national debt.
[03:37:35.635 --> 03:37:43.837]  And so we've literally, in one sense, the baby boomers have reached a point where we're worth more dead than alive.
[03:37:43.837 --> 03:37:45.838]  Just looking at the numbers.
[03:37:45.838 --> 03:38:00.281]  So if they succeed with this technological extermination grid that the White House science czar talks about, if all the population manipulation and reduction we've seen was just testing, what is the endgame?
[03:38:00.281 --> 03:38:02.502]  I mean, if they are able to carry this out,
[03:38:03.169 --> 03:38:04.490]  How do you see it unfolding?
[03:38:04.490 --> 03:38:08.334]  Well, frankly, I don't think they're going to be able to carry it out.
[03:38:08.334 --> 03:38:14.399]  I mean, I'm not saying they're not going to try, but it's a very big planet.
[03:38:14.399 --> 03:38:26.310]  What all of us need to understand is, in a world where, let's just take it as an assumption that we can be irradiated by a satellite by invisible weaponry from space,
[03:38:27.274 --> 03:38:39.622]  How do you push back against something that is that ubiquitous, both in terms of ability to force, ability to manipulate, whether it's through the media, your iPhone, or whatever?
[03:38:39.622 --> 03:38:40.962]  How do you do it?
[03:38:40.962 --> 03:38:53.030]  And if you look back through history, what you will see is where, you know, John Adams said the revolution was not the war, the revolution was in the hearts and the minds of the people.
[03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:54.851]  And Alex, we're talking about
[03:38:56.249 --> 03:39:01.770]  A point of view and a way of being which is unbelievably black.
[03:39:01.770 --> 03:39:08.432]  And if there's one thing I know about people, people are fundamentally healthy and people are fundamentally grounded.
[03:39:08.432 --> 03:39:12.673]  And they just do not go along with this kind of blackness.
[03:39:12.673 --> 03:39:22.035]  Now, it can do incredible harm on the way, but you're talking about ultimately a government that doesn't have what the Chinese call the mandate of heaven.
[03:39:23.089 --> 03:39:42.862]  You know, it's something that's based on a culture which is too perverted, too unhealthy, and too lacking in the kind of open transparency and, you know, it fits in its own bell jar.
[03:39:42.862 --> 03:39:49.847]  So you're saying there's going to be a revolution even within the control system and the elite, not having the stomach to carry all this out.
[03:39:49.847 --> 03:39:51.788]  The problem is, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[03:39:52.532 --> 03:40:17.306]  If that's not what you mean by that, or this revolution in the mind, and I agree with you, that's happening, as members of the mid-level establishment really figure out, my god, this really is a giant extermination system, then we see them racing to go to full robotic aircraft, full robotic tanks, full remote control systems, where you have robotic factories that
[03:40:18.080 --> 03:40:21.183]  Right, but you cannot run a large operation or enterprise, let alone a world government, on force.
[03:40:36.593 --> 03:40:39.834]  It has to have some kind of moral authority.
[03:40:39.834 --> 03:40:45.017]  It has to have some kind of vision and values that inspire its members to be loyal.
[03:40:45.017 --> 03:40:46.477]  Force is not enough.
[03:40:46.477 --> 03:40:51.219]  And so that's why they stage terror attacks and the elite play the part of the victim?
[03:40:51.219 --> 03:40:59.943]  Um... You know, it depends on which one, because remember that the elites are fighting.
[03:40:59.943 --> 03:41:04.325]  What you've got is you've got a situation where, because the elite is a pretty big group,
[03:41:04.980 --> 03:41:08.162]  But many of these people are prisoners of the system.
[03:41:08.162 --> 03:41:12.546]  In other words, they're part of what I call the Central Banking Warfare Model.
[03:41:12.546 --> 03:41:18.150]  And that model, Alex, the important thing to understand about that model is to date it's worked.
[03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:20.051]  I'll give you an example.
[03:41:20.051 --> 03:41:26.276]  In the summer of 2000, that was a busy summer, I was at a revival for Christian women in Atlanta.
[03:41:26.276 --> 03:41:26.616]  T.D.
[03:41:26.616 --> 03:41:33.401]  Jakes from Dallas, your state, had rented the Georgia Dome and had women there at loose.
[03:41:34.201 --> 03:41:43.464]  And I was sitting there with 100,000 African American women, and I was taking a spiritual warfare course with a pastor, and I was there with the church.
[03:41:43.464 --> 03:41:47.505]  And this particular pastor had worked at DEA.
[03:41:47.505 --> 03:41:49.686]  And T.D.
[03:41:49.686 --> 03:41:57.948]  Jakes brought George W. Bush in by monitor, and the whole crowd jumped up cheering for George W. Bush, including this pastor.
[03:41:58.593 --> 03:42:08.239]  When it was over, now what I hadn't explained early in my background was I ended up in very serious litigation with the federal government that went on for years and years and years.
[03:42:08.239 --> 03:42:11.642]  And, you know, I always say, I played Will Smith.
[03:42:11.642 --> 03:42:13.983]  If you've ever seen, you've seen the movie Enemy of the State, right?
[03:42:13.983 --> 03:42:14.484]  Yes.
[03:42:14.484 --> 03:42:16.125]  Okay, well, I played Will Smith in real life.
[03:42:16.125 --> 03:42:19.727]  It just took me a lot longer to find Gene Hackman.
[03:42:19.727 --> 03:42:25.471]  Anyway, so this minister should have been cured, and after it was over I said, you know,
[03:42:26.678 --> 03:42:36.994]  Patricia, I lost $6 million and I almost lost my life trying to stop Clinton and Bush family narcotics trafficking, and you just jumped up and cheered for this guy.
[03:42:36.994 --> 03:42:38.396]  And she said, well, he's going to be the winner.
[03:42:38.396 --> 03:42:40.078]  And I said, so he's a winner and I'm a loser?
[03:42:40.078 --> 03:42:41.060]  And she said, yeah, that's right.
[03:42:43.058 --> 03:42:43.498]  That's it.
[03:42:43.498 --> 03:42:48.139]  They feel like they're part of the power structure, even though it's going to destroy them.
[03:42:48.139 --> 03:42:49.620]  Well, but here's the thing.
[03:42:49.620 --> 03:42:58.122]  We have 57% of households in America now headed for 67% are dependent on government money.
[03:42:58.122 --> 03:43:01.083]  In other words, you know, I call it the taperoom economy.
[03:43:01.083 --> 03:43:03.684]  It's like having a taperoom.
[03:43:03.684 --> 03:43:11.626]  The taperoom injects into you a chemical that makes you, you know, do what's good for the taperoom and see the taperoom grow stronger and you grow weaker.
[03:43:12.674 --> 03:43:16.696]  Right now, the majority of us are practicing a philosophy of follow the tape.
[03:43:16.696 --> 03:43:27.822]  All that needs to happen, Alex, if you could get a critical mass, say, you know, the 100 monkey syndrome, if you could get 6-10% of the people saying, you know, I'm not going to go along with this, I'm going to withdraw.
[03:43:27.822 --> 03:43:31.404]  Because you don't want to have a fight with them, you don't want to get in a fight with the satellites.
[03:43:32.631 --> 03:43:37.513]  You just want to say, you know something, I'm pulling my money out of your game, because your game is shrinking.
[03:43:37.513 --> 03:43:41.514]  The problem with a centralization economically is it's shrinking the wealth.
[03:43:41.514 --> 03:43:54.759]  It's making a few people a little wealthier, but it's literally like if our body was in trauma, you know, if you or I got hit by a car, our body was in trauma, the body would preserve the blood for the heart, the lungs, and the brain.
[03:43:55.459 --> 03:44:05.210]  What's happening now is the economic body is preserving the blood for the toes and the fingers, and it's cutting off the blood from the heart and the brains.
[03:44:05.210 --> 03:44:09.735]  And that's why we're literally contemplating, you know, is this depopulation?
[03:44:09.735 --> 03:44:13.139]  Because you're literally killing off the real economy.
[03:44:13.899 --> 03:44:22.163]  Um, so you can centralize it, because when you flood a country with this much government money and government debt to keep things going, that's what you're doing.
[03:44:22.163 --> 03:44:26.345]  You're basically shrinking the pie of wealth in a way that centralizes it.
[03:44:26.345 --> 03:44:32.388]  But people are going along, and the minute we decide, you know, something, this is really unhealthy.
[03:44:33.894 --> 03:44:38.398]  This can't go in any place that's good for us, our children, our grandchildren.
[03:44:38.398 --> 03:44:40.519]  And we start to shift in theory.
[03:44:40.519 --> 03:44:43.362]  This does not have to be picking a fight.
[03:44:43.362 --> 03:44:44.483]  It's just withdrawing.
[03:44:44.483 --> 03:44:56.973]  So, if we turn off our TVs so we withdraw our time, if we withdraw our money from the big financial institutions and the big banks and start what I call demonetizing,
[03:44:58.802 --> 03:45:09.927]  Um, if you come into any county in America, Alex, you will find, you know, literally one person has got their savings and bank CDs that are in a large New York bank.
[03:45:09.927 --> 03:45:13.729]  Another one has their IRA in stock of that same large New York bank.
[03:45:14.229 --> 03:45:14.589]  Exactly!
[03:45:14.589 --> 03:45:17.612]  They should be loaning to each other and keeping it all local.
[03:45:38.911 --> 03:45:40.513]  Let me give you another example.
[03:45:40.513 --> 03:45:45.721]  In Tennessee, because there is so... Here's where the opportunity is.
[03:45:45.721 --> 03:45:50.548]  When you start to dig in and you bring transparency to how the money works in a place, and you say,
[03:45:51.571 --> 03:46:00.034]  Let's withdraw from the tapeworm system in a way that makes us money, because the problem we have is our wealth is shrinking.
[03:46:00.034 --> 03:46:07.876]  So we need to find a way to withdraw from the system that expands our wealth and stops us from getting drained financially.
[03:46:07.876 --> 03:46:13.938]  So, for example, I can't tell you how many communities and counties where you will find
[03:46:14.577 --> 03:46:24.086]  And they should go in and take control of their counties and make the counties spend the money with the locals, but they don't because one big fat cat wants to keep it all for themselves.
[03:46:36.378 --> 03:46:41.221]  Just at a primitive level, they don't want anybody else in a little town getting uppity.
[03:46:41.221 --> 03:46:51.766]  They have the same neurosis that the elite has, an instinctive need to keep people down around them, but in the process they destroy their own future.
[03:46:51.766 --> 03:46:53.927]  Well, but I think most people are scared.
[03:46:53.927 --> 03:46:54.928]  It's complicated.
[03:46:54.928 --> 03:46:56.328]  It's scared.
[03:46:56.328 --> 03:46:58.770]  How do you organize to do something that's effective?
[03:46:58.770 --> 03:47:00.531]  Now let me give you an example.
[03:47:00.531 --> 03:47:04.933]  In Florida and Tennessee, I'm sure it's more states too,
[03:47:05.906 --> 03:47:08.428]  I live in Tennessee.
[03:47:08.428 --> 03:47:11.690]  20% of our population is now on food stamps.
[03:47:11.690 --> 03:47:13.031]  20%, Alex.
[03:47:13.031 --> 03:47:21.177]  Now, there was a woman in Florida who worked all her life and then lost her job when the economy went down.
[03:47:21.795 --> 03:47:37.999]  She got food stamps, she had problems with the food stamps, called the food stamp hotline, the customer service line, to discover that the woman she was talking to, who was helping, you know, doing customer service for her food stamps, worked for JPMorgan Chase in India.
[03:47:37.999 --> 03:47:38.599]  Okay?
[03:47:38.599 --> 03:47:46.181]  So the government is paying her not to work, at the same time the government is paying somebody in India to do a job she could do.
[03:47:46.181 --> 03:47:49.302]  This doesn't make any sense, because the government is paying twice.
[03:47:50.063 --> 03:47:56.025]  But it's a payoff the government's doing to India to go under the globalist model.
[03:47:56.025 --> 03:47:57.066]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:47:57.066 --> 03:48:07.070]  If I run a government contract through a stock that's trading at 20 times earnings, so let's say my stock is trading at 20 times earnings,
[03:48:07.674 --> 03:48:11.376]  I give a government contract for $100 million.
[03:48:11.376 --> 03:48:14.737]  They make $10 million in profit on that government contract.
[03:48:14.737 --> 03:48:16.978]  Their stock goes up $200 million.
[03:48:16.978 --> 03:48:21.180]  That gives them the capital gains they need to donate to elections.
[03:48:21.180 --> 03:48:29.404]  If you look at campaign donations, the majority of that money comes from capital gains on either real estate or stock.
[03:48:29.404 --> 03:48:35.727]  And the way you get a stock to go up is by giving it lots of government contracts or government purchases or changing the rules.
[03:48:36.348 --> 03:48:46.326]  I have a great article I wrote called Dylan Reed and the Aristocracy of Stock Profits and it was about how much money a stock, a private prison stock trades on how many beds it has.
[03:48:46.326 --> 03:48:48.270]  So think of this as slavery.
[03:48:49.206 --> 03:48:54.311]  At the time I wrote the article, every additional bed you get costs your stock to go up $25,000.
[03:48:54.311 --> 03:49:13.947]  So the more, if you can pass a law that says, you know, mandated sentences are longer, the stocks will go up just on the passage of the law anticipating the... And the average American doesn't know that big banks that own and control prison complexes openly come in and give money
[03:49:15.316 --> 03:49:23.662]  To build more prisons, to lobby with your tax money to build the prison that they then make the profit off of, and they lobby to pass more laws.
[03:49:23.662 --> 03:49:29.466]  And it's the alcohol and cigarette lobbies that kill more than anybody, who are the biggest lobbyists for the drug war.
[03:49:29.466 --> 03:49:44.277]  Well, what's interesting is, if we reached a point where a significant, and I mean the 6-10%, like the 100 monkey syndrome, if we could get a critical mass of people to see how the game is played,
[03:49:44.941 --> 03:49:47.062]  And how it works around the money.
[03:49:47.062 --> 03:49:48.703]  That's when things start to change.
[03:49:48.703 --> 03:49:54.827]  Now, you know, in 1997, let me tell you the story.
[03:49:54.827 --> 03:50:09.576]  In 1997, remember, I'm trying to persuade the pension funds to reinvest in America in a way that really could have made the pension funds tremendous amounts of money compared to the way they've lost money in all these frauds.
[03:50:09.576 --> 03:50:10.096]  So in 1997, I had a
[03:50:11.638 --> 03:50:20.742]  I had a wonderful board of pension fund leaders, including the president of CalPERS, which is the largest pension fund in the country.
[03:50:20.742 --> 03:50:27.806]  And I gave them my presentation of how we could reinvest in America in a way that would make a lot of money for the pension fund.
[03:50:28.712 --> 03:50:31.575]  And the president of CalPERS looked at me and he said, you don't understand.
[03:50:31.575 --> 03:50:32.977]  It's too late.
[03:50:32.977 --> 03:50:34.358]  They've given up on the country.
[03:50:34.358 --> 03:50:37.482]  They're moving all the money out starting in the fall.
[03:50:37.482 --> 03:50:37.902]  And that was 1997.
[03:50:37.902 --> 03:50:40.265]  And so the fall of 1997 was the beginning of federal fiscal 1998.
[03:50:40.265 --> 03:50:41.627]  And that's when $4 trillion, $4 trillion,
[03:50:48.806 --> 03:50:50.447]  Stay there, final segment.
[03:50:50.447 --> 03:50:54.290]  An A-Z product listing, top 20 best sellers, and 30% off monthly specials.

[03:52:04.295 --> 03:52:08.324]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:08.324 --> 03:52:11.571]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:11.571 --> 03:52:12.993]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:13.678 --> 03:52:16.361]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:16.361 --> 03:52:22.747]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:22.747 --> 03:52:27.932]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:27.932 --> 03:52:37.941]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:38.041 --> 03:52:40.383]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:40.383 --> 03:52:41.985]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:41.985 --> 03:52:44.447]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:44.447 --> 03:52:46.570]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:46.570 --> 03:52:51.715]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:51.715 --> 03:53:00.824]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:02.748 --> 03:53:11.452]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[03:53:11.452 --> 03:53:17.455]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[03:53:17.455 --> 03:53:23.978]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[03:53:24.545 --> 03:53:27.946]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[03:53:27.946 --> 03:53:30.387]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[03:53:36.988 --> 03:53:40.509]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.

[03:54:01.703 --> 03:54:03.304]  And plenty this holiday season.
[03:54:23.192 --> 03:54:28.076]  Heather Austin Fitts is a very impressive lady, and I'm glad we hooked back up with her and have her on.
[03:54:28.076 --> 03:54:33.061]  Mother, she said she'll come back on in two weeks, and I'm really looking forward to that.
[03:54:33.061 --> 03:54:36.844]  I was just flattered for her to tell me that she actually bought a copy of The Obama Deception.
[03:54:36.844 --> 03:54:39.166]  We're going to mail her a copy of Fall of the Republic.
[03:54:39.166 --> 03:54:41.889]  I don't have time to play it, but we have the CNN clip now.
[03:54:41.889 --> 03:54:46.292]  It'll be up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com after the show.
[03:54:46.292 --> 03:54:50.056]  CNN talking about Fall of the Republic, and not in a nice way.
[03:54:51.598 --> 03:55:03.287]  Again, CBS News, Jerusalem Post, a whole bunch of mainstream publications said that I'm incredibly influential, dangerous, charismatic.
[03:55:03.287 --> 03:55:04.488]  What was one quote?
[03:55:04.488 --> 03:55:05.769]  Incredibly popular.
[03:55:06.537 --> 03:55:09.178]  And believe me, I don't like this as a power trip.
[03:55:09.178 --> 03:55:11.658]  I know it's dangerous going up against these folks.
[03:55:11.658 --> 03:55:14.019]  Catherine, what does it mean, though?
[03:55:14.019 --> 03:55:18.120]  Because on the street, you were just saying during the break, people are saying we're mainstream now.
[03:55:18.120 --> 03:55:20.780]  I mean, people are really listening to us.
[03:55:20.780 --> 03:55:27.062]  We're going from being kind of cutting edge to being passe in a way.
[03:55:29.296 --> 03:55:39.500]  But, I mean, does that creep you out to know that the system is going from being arrogant about us to now actually sitting up and going, you know, danger Will Robinson.
[03:55:39.500 --> 03:55:42.001]  I mean, I see them putting out alarm flares.
[03:55:42.001 --> 03:55:47.643]  Remember, the corporate media will always shift to protect its channel.
[03:55:48.383 --> 03:56:05.237]  So, what happens is, you know, you do something wonderful, and it starts to draw a lot of interest and support, and they will suddenly shift to try and co-opt that audience back in something that's, you know, like, but not the same thing.
[03:56:05.237 --> 03:56:09.281]  But don't they know that's not going to work anymore because they've lost all credibility?
[03:56:09.281 --> 03:56:16.287]  Well, that's why, you know, they keep getting closer and closer to what we're saying, because they're trying to protect the channel as our audience grows.
[03:56:16.989 --> 03:56:22.032]  What was Obama, because we talked during the break, what is Obama all about?
[03:56:22.032 --> 03:56:23.633]  Who is Obama?
[03:56:23.633 --> 03:56:26.215]  Well, I think Obama was somebody who was profiled.
[03:56:26.215 --> 03:56:43.366]  In other words, you know, a lot of smart money said, look, we have engaged in massive financial fraud, this thing is a bubble, and essentially we're going to pump and dump it, but on the dump, if we don't do something,
[03:56:44.162 --> 03:56:47.544]  We are really going to have trouble maintaining control.
[03:56:47.544 --> 03:57:01.032]  And so I think the question for them was who, you know, what kind of candidate and what kind of sort of new president could maintain, you know, could maintain the control.
[03:57:01.032 --> 03:57:09.197]  Because remember, what you always want to do is present people with a style choice that makes them feel good so you don't have to give them any money.
[03:57:10.026 --> 03:57:20.308]  But what is happening is we're fundamentally renegotiating the relationship between labor and capital, and they needed somebody who could consolidate their position.
[03:57:20.308 --> 03:57:34.671]  And what we've seen is, from the time that Obama became the candidate, he has used his political credibility to essentially make possible a $12 trillion gift to the banking system.
[03:57:34.671 --> 03:57:36.311]  And it's quite extraordinary, Alex.
[03:57:37.906 --> 03:57:44.690]  $12 trillion is the total amount of money that the United States government has borrowed since the Revolutionary War.
[03:57:44.690 --> 03:57:53.415]  So that includes paying for World War II, World War I, Vietnam, and that amount of money we've gifted to the banking system.
[03:57:53.415 --> 03:57:59.718]  Now, that's an enormous, that's probably the most impressive political feat in the history of the planet.
[03:57:59.718 --> 03:58:01.539]  It's incredible.
[03:58:01.539 --> 03:58:05.121]  And he did all this while saying he was balancing the budget and was going to cut things.
[03:58:06.147 --> 03:58:11.180]  Well, what's amazing is because there's so many people...
[03:58:12.111 --> 03:58:25.941]  Who I see still supporting Obama, because they can't fathom that the President is a fashion statement as opposed to a real manager of power.
[03:58:25.941 --> 03:58:30.304]  Solari.com, a lot of great investment information there.
[03:58:30.304 --> 03:58:32.426]  So much to offer, Solari.com.
[03:58:32.426 --> 03:58:35.728]  Catherine Austin Fitch, I look forward to having you back on in two weeks.
[03:58:35.728 --> 03:58:37.589]  Have a great day, Alex.
[03:58:37.589 --> 03:58:39.071]  Let me say bye to you right here at the end.
[03:58:39.071 --> 03:58:39.911]  I'm sure he hung up.
[03:58:39.911 --> 03:58:40.952]  I'm going to call her.
[03:58:43.362 --> 03:58:45.986]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:45.986 --> 03:58:49.151]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[03:58:51.363 --> 03:59:00.508]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:59:00.508 --> 03:59:03.869]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:59:03.869 --> 03:59:09.752]  Instead, use vitamin C-D and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife, for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:59:09.752 --> 03:59:14.535]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:59:14.535 --> 03:59:16.876]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:59:17.056 --> 03:59:17.476]  Thank you.
