[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:05.652]  Here's the headline, here is the New York Times, a new world order, a world in need of a new order.
[00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:08.253]  Again, they create the crisis, they offer the solution.
[00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:14.357]  The Times of London reports that G20 summit Europeans demand threatens to wreck deals.
[00:00:14.377 --> 00:00:15.837]  They're acting like there's a fight going on here.
[00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:25.662]  They demand that the global government have strong controls and global taxation systems so no one can escape high taxes, regulation, control of banking, businesses, everything.
[00:00:26.403 --> 00:00:27.784]  And we've got a clip I'm going to play later.
[00:00:28.724 --> 00:00:40.026]  And get Economist George Humphrey's take on it, where we have Tim Geithner, who doesn't pay us taxes, as the head of the Treasury, telling CBS News
[00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:45.183]  That, oh yeah, we're going to go after other corporations and companies, not just the head of GM.
[00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:47.566]  So, I mean, if that isn't tyranny, I don't know what it is.
[00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:50.910]  Where they say, you do what the government says or we'll order you to step down.
[00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.018]  No judge, no jury, no grand jury, no court order, just the president says so.
[00:00:57.078 --> 00:00:58.500]  That's dictatorship.
[00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:01.882]  So you let the foreign banks take over your industry.
[00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:02.882]  You hand everything over.
[00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:06.403]  This is what the IMF and World Bank do in third world countries they're in control of.
[00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:09.304]  And just a really huge story that came out yesterday.
[00:01:09.984 --> 00:01:14.186]  Washington Post, Senate legislation would federalize cyber security.
[00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:15.406]  Everything's being seized.
[00:01:15.806 --> 00:01:18.087]  Rules for private networks also proposed.
[00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:21.308]  Now, this bill's been out for a few weeks.
[00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:24.009]  This is why the head of cyber security resigned.
[00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:32.853]  Three weeks ago, this was the head of the program for the federal government, said this is a Pentagon takeover of all private industry involved with computers.
[00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:37.637]  With how computers are built, the back doors in them, how everything operates.
[00:01:38.258 --> 00:01:39.839]  He said a threat to democracy.
[00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.141]  You mean a threat to the free republic.
[00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.163]  Senate legislation would federalize cyber security.
[00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:55.473]  Now, this also brings in federal funds, just like they did with the 96 Telecommunications Act, to put NSA snooping floors, whole floors, in all major telecommunications companies so the internet all runs through them already.
[00:01:56.054 --> 00:02:01.879]  This is so they have back doors into all the hubs to shut the web down, and that's what the Pentagon admits they're drilling for.
[00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:05.002]  And what they're going to do is, say China did it,
[00:02:05.362 --> 00:02:08.944]  Shut down the web, then relaunch it as Internet 2 with total controls.
[00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:14.467]  And you watch, that's a big false flag terror attack, a financial and free speech attack they're planning to launch.
[00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:15.648]  And I've done the analysis on that.
[00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:18.089]  Here's UPI, U.S.
[00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.051]  Cyber Security headquits, citing growing role of spy agencies.
[00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:24.632]  For those watching on the Internet, I apologize.
[00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:29.255]  My printer ink was running out when I printed this one, so it's hard to read there on screen.
[00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:31.276]  In fact, guys, just pull this up.
[00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:32.517]  Just Google U.S.
[00:02:32.537 --> 00:02:35.939]  Cyber Security Chief Quits and we'll just punch that up from the web itself.
[00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.660]  That's United Press International.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.541]  You'll get AP Reuters, too, when you do that.
[00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:41.522]  And we're trying to get him on the show, but...
[00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:46.776]  So people say, oh, we don't see any whistleblowers on this takeover, like you say, Alex.
[00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:47.937]  That's all we see.
[00:02:48.037 --> 00:02:54.943]  Fox Fallon refused to attack Iran and refused to let Dick Cheney have Navy SEALs attack their ships, acting like Iran did it.
[00:02:55.303 --> 00:02:57.245]  Source MSNBC, New Yorker Magazine.
[00:02:57.545 --> 00:03:01.969]  And Fox Fallon, the head of CENTCOM, quit.
[00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.392]  We'd already be in World War III, folks.
[00:03:04.472 --> 00:03:05.473]  It is the whistleblowers.
[00:03:06.357 --> 00:03:12.180]  We've had NSA whistleblowers come out and say they listen to Americans having phone sex and sit around the NSA laughing.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:23.547]  And now over 70% of phone and internet security has been handed out to private security firms owned and run by people like felon Admiral Poindexter, the Total Information Awareness Network.
[00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:25.668]  So most of it's being done by private groups now.
[00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.731]  It says the official in charge of coordinating U.S.
[00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.612]  government cybersecurity operations has quit.
[00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.211]  Saying, expanding control of the National Security Agency over the nation's computer security poses threats to our democratic process.
[00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:51.555]  Even from a security standpoint, Rob Breckstrom, the head of the Department of Homeland Security's National Cyber Security Center, told United Press International, it is unwise to hand over security of all government networks to a single organization.
[00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:52.635]  Well, yeah, it's dictatorship.
[00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:58.257]  But then it goes on with the new bill, and he talks about the private takeover, total takeover of everything!
[00:03:59.198 --> 00:03:59.818]  They've announced
[00:04:00.772 --> 00:04:06.415]  Senator Rockefeller, Jay Rockefeller, went on TV last week and said, if we'd be better off without the web, we've got to get rid of it.
[00:04:06.816 --> 00:04:13.900]  New York Times says, we've got to get rid of the old Internet, have Internet 2, where you have a sub-domain on somebody else's government site or private industry.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.282]  50 corporations get it, 50 universities and 50 agencies.
[00:04:17.302 --> 00:04:17.982]  That's Internet 2.
[00:04:18.282 --> 00:04:23.926]  And then you'll have 150 domains for each nation, you'll have a sub-account, and they'll have rules and say you can't post.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.961]  This is openly, publicly stated.
[00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:31.641]  This is Internet 2, and they're going to end that neutrality, start taxing the web.
[00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:32.321]  It's already happening.
[00:04:33.842 --> 00:04:34.262]  This is it.
[00:04:35.182 --> 00:04:35.502]  Stated.
[00:04:35.762 --> 00:04:37.023]  And here's the bill.
[00:04:37.703 --> 00:04:39.783]  Senate legislation with federalized cyber security.
[00:04:39.823 --> 00:04:41.163]  It says over private industry.
[00:04:41.544 --> 00:04:42.704]  I mean, you can go read it for yourself.
[00:04:43.024 --> 00:04:44.324]  They just tell you how great it is, though.
[00:04:44.744 --> 00:04:46.045]  People say, well, why do you use mainstream news?
[00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:47.525]  Well, a lot of times they tell the truth.
[00:04:47.545 --> 00:04:48.305]  They just spin it.
[00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:50.306]  They're admitting what they're doing here.
[00:04:50.346 --> 00:04:52.226]  They just say it's a good idea to keep it safe from China.
[00:04:54.491 --> 00:05:01.014]  So you understand folks, they're openly saying they want to shut down the web, how terrible it is, the newspapers are imploding, the establishment is losing all credibility.
[00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:02.354]  They have to shut it down.
[00:05:03.675 --> 00:05:13.059]  And believe me, when they set off a nuke or release smallpox or whatever these jackasses are planning, you better believe that they're going after the web first and they're going to claim that China or Russia did it.
[00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:26.250]  Meanwhile, clear evidence that the computer cables to Russia and the Middle East and places keep getting cut by deep submersibles, and only Russia, England, France, and a few other countries have.
[00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.571]  So they're busy trying to chop those as well.
[00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:33.052]  Here's the Geithner on ousting CEOs, reviving economy.
[00:05:33.092 --> 00:05:34.393]  We're going to get into that.
[00:05:37.314 --> 00:05:38.654]  Here is an important story.
[00:05:38.894 --> 00:05:40.415]  Deep solar minimum
[00:05:41.602 --> 00:05:46.664]  And it says the sunspot cycle 1995 to present.
[00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:53.927]  And if you go up to NASA's website, for some reason our one on Infowars.com, we posted this but it links to the wrong thing.
[00:05:53.947 --> 00:05:55.047]  It links to Bilderberg stories.
[00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:56.508]  We need to get that fixed.
[00:05:56.588 --> 00:05:58.009]  Deep solar minimum.
[00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.271]  Now you can see the 12-year sun cycle.
[00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:08.673]  And the highest sun cycle on record
[00:06:10.748 --> 00:06:11.349]  Well, it's right here.
[00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.676]  You can click on it and look at the graph going back for over 60 years with scientific, very high-tech scientific instruments.
[00:06:17.497 --> 00:06:26.789]  Now this is in 2000, 2001, the super peak, global warming throughout the solar system.
[00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.391]  And then over here,
[00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:33.666]  You can see where we currently are down there in the dip, 2009.
[00:06:34.126 --> 00:06:38.247]  And if you see that, there is almost no solar activity.
[00:06:38.527 --> 00:06:42.148]  Look at the last dip in the cycle in 1997.
[00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:47.389]  Look how much higher sun activity was at the last low point.
[00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.130]  I mean, this is a record low point.
[00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.011]  The sun is putting off no solar flares right now.
[00:06:52.691 --> 00:06:57.232]  They appear as sun spots to the naked eye, giant Coriolis ejections.
[00:06:58.172 --> 00:07:03.073]  Hundreds of times the size of the planet Earth that shoot out, that disrupt satellites, all sorts of things.
[00:07:04.293 --> 00:07:04.933]  There you have it.
[00:07:05.393 --> 00:07:07.534]  Now, when is it set to peak again?
[00:07:07.554 --> 00:07:07.534]  2012.
[00:07:08.374 --> 00:07:09.014]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:09.334]  Everything's 2012.
[00:07:09.434 --> 00:07:11.855]  I don't put much stock in that, but a lot of folks do.
[00:07:12.235 --> 00:07:13.375]  Look at that.
[00:07:13.435 --> 00:07:24.637]  That's from NASA, and they've got a bunch of other graphs in here showing what's happening with that on that front.
[00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:32.026]  You know, I mentioned this yesterday, but it really needs to be covered again.
[00:07:32.046 --> 00:07:34.668]  And that is a Bloomberg article.
[00:07:34.728 --> 00:07:35.509]  It was everywhere else.
[00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:40.573]  Three days before, we posted a George Washington blog spot story.
[00:07:40.613 --> 00:07:42.614]  The guy does great research, great analysis.
[00:07:43.535 --> 00:07:53.743]  And he showed the Congressional Budget Office's own numbers that the current spending was approaching the size of the gross domestic product of the United States.
[00:07:54.584 --> 00:07:55.285]  Just the bailout.
[00:07:56.095 --> 00:08:02.558]  He gave a number of $11 trillion and two days later it came out, oh no, the government admits it's worse than that.
[00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:10.543]  It's $12.8 trillion, $200 billion short of the entire GDP of the country.
[00:08:10.583 --> 00:08:16.426]  But I noticed the comments of the trolls under it were, that's a lie, he's making this up, it's not that big.
[00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:17.706]  And then now it's all admitted.
[00:08:18.887 --> 00:08:22.349]  Just denial, denial, denial, denial.
[00:08:23.049 --> 00:08:24.510]  I had that story here in my stack.
[00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:26.552]  It doesn't matter.
[00:08:26.592 --> 00:08:27.373]  I covered it yesterday.
[00:08:28.013 --> 00:08:30.757]  It's just there is so much going on.
[00:08:31.898 --> 00:08:34.301]  We posted a story yesterday.
[00:08:38.362 --> 00:08:43.449]  John Yoo arrested, and we documented the fact that they have not arrested him, that that was a rumor.
[00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:55.985]  But what is not a rumor is that he has been indicted along with eleven others in Spain for war crimes and crimes against humanity for writing memos ordering the torture of children.
[00:08:57.392 --> 00:08:58.912]  So I thought I would let you know that.
[00:08:58.932 --> 00:09:09.375]  That's where that rumor came from and we tried to whack-a-mole and try to stop that rumor, but of course we're not that influential, so who knows what will happen with that.
[00:09:09.995 --> 00:09:15.497]  Another White House would-be official is in trouble for not paying back taxes.
[00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:31.766]  Sebalenis, if I'm pronouncing it right, held the name of Secretary nominee Kathleen Sebales, recently corrected three years of tax returns and paid more than $7,000 back after finding unintentional errors.
[00:09:32.967 --> 00:09:42.575]  Now see, that's nothing compared to all the other ones in the administration where it's hundreds of thousands of dollars, free limos, not paying taxes period like Geithner and saying he didn't have to and then fighting it.
[00:09:44.687 --> 00:09:48.009]  Another story here out of the Associated Press.
[00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:49.130]  Promises, promises.
[00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.752]  Obama's tax pledge goes up in smoke.
[00:09:52.372 --> 00:09:56.155]  And it talks about how he promised no new taxes of any type except if you made over $125,000 a year.
[00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:57.696]  Every time I say that I get emails.
[00:09:57.716 --> 00:09:58.056]  They go, it's $250,000!
[00:09:58.236 --> 00:09:58.596]  With a couple.
[00:09:58.616 --> 00:09:58.836]  That's $125,000.
[00:09:58.876 --> 00:09:59.617]  Anybody making that or more?
[00:10:08.226 --> 00:10:14.117]  And that's your lower middle class, folks, in the real scale of things, and that's who actually buys things from you locally, and that's your real economy.
[00:10:14.137 --> 00:10:17.463]  But don't worry, the elite will get rid of that for you and see how you're doing out there poor.
[00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:23.184]  One of President Barack Obama's campaign pledges on taxes went up in puffs of smoke Wednesday.
[00:10:23.684 --> 00:10:31.792]  The largest increase in tobacco taxes took effect despite Obama's promise not to raise sales taxes on any kind of families earning under $250,000 or individuals under $200,000.
[00:10:32.493 --> 00:10:36.477]  This is the one tax that disproportionately affects the poor, and it goes on.
[00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:38.819]  Oh, that's okay, he broke his promise on cigarettes.
[00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:39.199]  No.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:46.025]  They're raising all these different taxes, and they're getting rid of the loopholes, as they call them.
[00:10:46.105 --> 00:10:51.869]  It's really just tax write-offs for your house, or for your mortgage deduction, or for education.
[00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:53.951]  They're saying they're getting hundreds of deductions.
[00:10:54.411 --> 00:10:55.512]  So, and that's on everybody.
[00:10:55.552 --> 00:11:04.538]  Just massive, massive tax increases on everybody, and it all goes, not to the nation, but to foreign bankers.
[00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:06.080]  Your call, straight ahead.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.661]  More news, straight ahead.
[00:11:08.945 --> 00:11:17.034]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:11:17.195 --> 00:11:21.580]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.285]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:11:26.445 --> 00:11:27.867]  It's a documented fact.
[00:11:27.927 --> 00:11:28.287]  We're good to go!
[00:11:46.701 --> 00:11:47.341]  We're good to go!
[00:12:09.051 --> 00:12:12.652]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:12:12.953 --> 00:12:16.494]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[00:12:16.774 --> 00:12:25.597]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.

[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.903]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:15.404 --> 00:13:22.408]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:22.981 --> 00:13:29.168]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:29.568 --> 00:13:31.410]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.973]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:34.053 --> 00:13:45.005]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:45.626 --> 00:13:46.907]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:47.287 --> 00:13:48.688]  It's about a one world government.
[00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:55.473]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:14:04.319 --> 00:14:05.480]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:05.901 --> 00:14:07.162]  The people strike back.
[00:14:09.203 --> 00:14:11.805]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:14:12.412 --> 00:14:15.374]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:19.156]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:14:19.516 --> 00:14:25.720]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.144]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:14:31.324 --> 00:14:38.048]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.

[00:15:17.475 --> 00:15:21.478]  Coming up, when George Humbert gets here in studio, I'm going to break down the latest G20 news.
[00:15:21.558 --> 00:15:22.778]  I've got a big stack of it here.
[00:15:22.798 --> 00:15:27.681]  They have agreed on the regulatory changes to the world system.
[00:15:27.701 --> 00:15:37.107]  A new global regulator over all the nations, in the words of Time Magazine in an article titled The New World Order, to knock the heads of the American people, to punish us.
[00:15:37.988 --> 00:15:41.270]  Taxes will be paid directly to them, and they've wanted a
[00:15:43.363 --> 00:15:45.144]  500 million dollar deal, that's not enough.
[00:15:45.364 --> 00:15:57.248]  It is a trillion and a half dollars of tax money to be given from the American people and the people of Europe to the private banks to set up their new global super currency.
[00:15:57.288 --> 00:15:58.028]  That's Reuters.
[00:15:59.109 --> 00:16:01.389]  I've also got MSNBC right here.
[00:16:01.409 --> 00:16:04.110]  I mean, it's all happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.072]  It's all happening in our face.
[00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:11.153]  Let's go ahead and talk to Maureen in Virginia.
[00:16:11.193 --> 00:16:11.773]  You're on the air.
[00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:13.372]  Hey, how are you?
[00:16:13.392 --> 00:16:14.412]  I'm all right.
[00:16:14.793 --> 00:16:15.533]  I've got something.
[00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:17.735]  First of all, thank you for everything you do.
[00:16:18.115 --> 00:16:22.559]  Now, so much that is said absolutely sounds scary.
[00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:26.662]  We need to remember we serve the Most High God.
[00:16:26.982 --> 00:16:29.584]  These other idiots are serving Satan.
[00:16:30.044 --> 00:16:33.027]  He only took one-third of the angels with him.
[00:16:33.107 --> 00:16:35.248]  It's going to be a two-against-one fight.
[00:16:35.709 --> 00:16:39.812]  Go read chapters 1, 2, and 3 of Hebrews and just see.
[00:16:40.472 --> 00:16:41.353]  We are told
[00:16:41.809 --> 00:16:46.191]  That they are all ministering spirits sent forth to minister to the heirs of salvation.
[00:16:46.592 --> 00:16:47.452]  That is us.
[00:16:48.333 --> 00:17:06.643]  And I put a website up, citiesforrefuge.info, and God has shown us that he is setting up cities of refuge, and I know so many people have been called to different places to set up places for other people to go to when things get bad.
[00:17:08.103 --> 00:17:13.287]  Well, I mean, I agree that this is a fight against good and evil, and we need to ask God for his guidance and help.
[00:17:13.747 --> 00:17:28.078]  My problem is most of the Christian churches and other religions have been bought off by the government, by the World Council of Churches, by the UN, and they're telling people, stand down, go to the FEMA camps, you know, that tyranny is good, and that Romans 13, out of context, Hitler's favorite Bible passage.
[00:17:28.098 --> 00:17:34.463]  So, you know, the solution is in the church, but it's also, the problem is the phony church.
[00:17:34.864 --> 00:17:35.744]  I appreciate your call.
[00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:36.625]  Chris in Florida.
[00:17:36.965 --> 00:17:37.706]  Chris, you're on the air.
[00:17:39.983 --> 00:17:43.047]  Yeah, go on YouTube and just see a parody of the Queen.
[00:17:43.087 --> 00:17:45.510]  You'll really enjoy it.
[00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.574]  From modern-day minstrels called Basements of Jax.
[00:17:49.215 --> 00:17:50.176]  J-A-X-X.
[00:17:50.557 --> 00:17:52.920]  Called You Don't Know Me, letter you don't know me.
[00:17:53.516 --> 00:17:59.763]  And it's funny how the Queen goes around abusing her own servants in the public after she goes on the run.
[00:18:00.263 --> 00:18:07.811]  But there's a quote, it's my little tribute to liberals to have it come out on 666 end quote.
[00:18:08.272 --> 00:18:12.957]  She's quoted a saying in USA Today and she's talking about her
[00:18:13.638 --> 00:18:28.365]  Her book, which I'm sure was full of very pressing matters, Ann Coulter, the quick change agent you were talking about, recently wrote a book entitled Godless, the Church of Liberalism, released on 6-6-2006.
[00:18:29.565 --> 00:18:39.490]  And so I also wanted to ask you regarding Obama, were you aware that he also, one of his broken promises was that his
[00:18:40.306 --> 00:19:00.989]  His $3,000 tax cut that he promised to businesses if they were to hire any new employees, and it's not in the stimulus bill, and other indicators that show that his acts, that he is on the side of the bankers, suggesting that the 401k and the IRA participation should be mandatory if your employer offers it.
[00:19:01.995 --> 00:19:04.938]  And it's kind of like Bush Jr.'
[00:19:04.918 --> 00:19:06.619]  's idea of investing the Social Security.
[00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:12.945]  Yeah, make you give your money to a 401k that's given to the derivatives bankers to basically steal it.
[00:19:12.965 --> 00:19:13.846]  I appreciate your call.
[00:19:14.306 --> 00:19:17.049]  Speaking of bizarreness, this is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:18.290]  Kurt Nimoy did a story about it.
[00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:24.415]  No, but it's mainstream news and he links to Queen Elizabeth's gift to Calderon, the President of Mexico.
[00:19:24.776 --> 00:19:25.697]  Guess what he gave her?
[00:19:26.557 --> 00:19:28.358]  George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.
[00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:30.700]  People think, oh, she's exposing the police state.
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:37.165]  No, they're the ones putting in the cameras and the control grids that are doing all of this.
[00:19:37.725 --> 00:19:40.207]  And so that's why Hillary says her favorite book is Nineteen Eighty-Four.
[00:19:40.547 --> 00:19:44.150]  For them, it is a blueprint of control.
[00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:55.478]  For them, it is a way to control society and to limit the language and to pass all these hate speech laws and to train the children to be spies on their parents.
[00:19:56.198 --> 00:20:07.968]  Felipe Calderon gave the uh... well he gave the Queen of England a uh... marquee tray but the Queen gave Calderon a collector's edition of George R. Wells' dystopian novel 1984.
[00:20:08.629 --> 00:20:12.112]  Calderon received the book as he bowed and scraped at Buckingham Palace.
[00:20:12.813 --> 00:20:18.338]  On its face the gift presented to Calderon seems rather strange but when you think about it not really.
[00:20:18.378 --> 00:20:21.841]  It's a novel, Oceania, has a strict social class arrangement
[00:20:22.361 --> 00:20:26.145]  With the inner party at the top, 2% of the population representing the big brother.
[00:20:26.466 --> 00:20:29.830]  The outer party of bureaucrats in the middle and the large number of proles at the bottom.
[00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:36.797]  The inner party believes that the proles are inferior and expendable and strives to make certain they live in misery.
[00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:38.799]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:20:38.819 --> 00:20:40.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:09.522 --> 00:21:10.402]  Spring is here.
[00:21:10.663 --> 00:21:11.423]  Growing season.
[00:21:11.623 --> 00:21:13.604]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:21:13.804 --> 00:21:15.225]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:16.185]  Think about it.
[00:21:16.505 --> 00:21:20.347]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:21:20.587 --> 00:21:24.069]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:25.970]  The country is running out of food.
[00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.791]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:21:29.072 --> 00:21:35.975]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs,
[00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:36.475]  I'm good.
[00:21:55.072 --> 00:21:59.634]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:59.654 --> 00:22:01.555]  We've got to give them a stake.
[00:22:17.139 --> 00:22:20.862]  In creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:22:21.402 --> 00:22:27.607]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:27.907 --> 00:22:29.729]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:29.869 --> 00:22:32.271]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:22:32.331 --> 00:22:43.239]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:22:45.507 --> 00:22:46.788]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:47.188 --> 00:22:48.588]  It's about a one world government.
[00:22:49.048 --> 00:22:55.371]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:23:04.214 --> 00:23:05.354]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:05.774 --> 00:23:06.975]  The people strike back.
[00:23:08.695 --> 00:23:15.659]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:23:15.899 --> 00:23:20.202]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:23:20.462 --> 00:23:25.565]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:23:26.066 --> 00:23:33.130]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.

[00:23:38.972 --> 00:23:44.433]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:23:44.813 --> 00:23:50.295]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[00:24:00.462 --> 00:24:05.026]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:05.046 --> 00:24:06.647]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:29.136 --> 00:24:31.797]  Well, I've got George Humphrey, my good friend, in studio with us.
[00:24:32.018 --> 00:24:38.781]  He is an economist, a very successful businessman, author, lecturer, filmmaker, and former Austin City Councilman.
[00:24:39.161 --> 00:24:44.184]  And back when I was first waking up in, like, 94, 95, I was involved in politics a little bit in Austin.
[00:24:44.204 --> 00:24:47.626]  I would run into George Humphrey, and he was talking about the New World Order and all this stuff, and I'd read some books about it.
[00:24:48.126 --> 00:25:05.921]  So he was instrumental in a lot of my formation of my ideas as well and here we are 14 years, well that'd be 16 years later, but you know here we are 14 years after I got on air and he's got his own local TV show he does from time to time, very busy man, George Humphrey, and today we're going to leave and go do more interviews with him for the second Obama film.
[00:25:05.961 --> 00:25:14.809]  I haven't decided on the name yet, I'm very close and because Obama Deception has been so successful and so up to date, it's actually worse than we thought with the
[00:25:15.089 --> 00:25:20.371]  They've introduced another bill for compulsory service, so I'm going to go down the list with you, George, just on issue after issue.
[00:25:20.391 --> 00:25:23.151]  Next hour, we're going to put the phones up for all of your calls.
[00:25:23.191 --> 00:25:27.253]  But, George, you were ranting during the break, raving, and I appreciate the rave reviews.
[00:25:28.213 --> 00:25:30.774]  You're in the Obama deception, but you're in a few of my other films.
[00:25:31.274 --> 00:25:34.775]  You said they were good, but I didn't get this excited, so you're not just saying it's good because you're in it.
[00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:37.936]  Break down the film like you were breaking down for me during the break.
[00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:42.237]  Well, Alex, I don't rant that much, but I'll tell you what.
[00:25:42.297 --> 00:25:44.478]  We had a bunch of people over at my house last night.
[00:25:45.738 --> 00:25:49.761]  And to a person, everybody was totally, totally impressed.
[00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:55.766]  And I have been in some of your other films, and your other films have been excellent and positive and good information.
[00:25:56.486 --> 00:26:07.355]  And in my opinion, the presentation, the professionalism on this, the people who were the guests, Celente, KRS, unbelievable.
[00:26:08.371 --> 00:26:15.174]  And if you have not downloaded this, or more importantly, buy some copies from Alex.
[00:26:15.614 --> 00:26:19.296]  Because as you buy the copies from Alex, then he can do more stuff.
[00:26:19.996 --> 00:26:23.617]  And this is a big deal, friends.
[00:26:24.058 --> 00:26:30.020]  And it's hard to be objective about a film that I'm in, and I'm in it for maybe six or seven minutes.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:36.102]  And it was my total, complete honor to be of service to this film.
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:50.006]  What we are facing right now is so, so much bigger and coming at us so much faster than 98% of the patriots in this country have any idea about.
[00:26:50.767 --> 00:26:58.811]  And I am just so pleased that I have been of help and that you have been a good friend of mine for so long.
[00:26:59.411 --> 00:27:00.212]  And I'll tell you what.
[00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:02.739]  The game's on, friends.
[00:27:02.899 --> 00:27:05.024]  The game is on.
[00:27:05.244 --> 00:27:07.068]  It's not about ten years from now.
[00:27:07.108 --> 00:27:07.749]  It's not about 2012.
[00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:08.591]  It's about right now.
[00:27:12.011 --> 00:27:35.608]  And the choice is whether you're going to go down the path of the New World Order, whether you're going to go down the path of fear, whether you're going to go down the path of materialism, or whether you're going to make the choice and realize that you and every single one of you, black, white, Hispanic, Oriental, is that we're all part of God's creation and that we can all make things better.
[00:27:35.988 --> 00:27:40.672]  And if we see this thing with clear eyes and a full heart,
[00:27:42.503 --> 00:27:53.348]  Then we can have some love in our hearts and realize that we don't have to go to this materialistic gulag that is being prepared for us.
[00:27:53.908 --> 00:28:00.331]  And I'll tell you what, our opponents right now, people like Obama, and remember, Obama is only a puppet.
[00:28:00.872 --> 00:28:01.592]  He is a puppet.
[00:28:01.672 --> 00:28:02.893]  It's not about Obama.
[00:28:03.213 --> 00:28:09.196]  It's about something much bigger, just like it wasn't about George Bush, because it's about something much, much bigger.
[00:28:12.097 --> 00:28:14.239]  It is so good to be in body right now.
[00:28:14.419 --> 00:28:29.410]  It is so wonderful to have this freedom to be able to speak about this issue, and there is no greater time to be alive and speak about freedom, to speak about love, to speak about God, to speak about the Republic.
[00:28:30.051 --> 00:28:34.814]  I love this country, and I'll tell you what, I know that if you're listening to this, you do too.
[00:28:35.315 --> 00:28:40.659]  So listen to what Alex has to say, and we're going to give you a whole, whole bunch of information today.
[00:28:41.064 --> 00:28:42.125]  I've got a lot of questions for you.
[00:28:42.145 --> 00:28:46.190]  We're also taping for the film, the new Obama film, while you're in studio with us right now.
[00:28:47.311 --> 00:28:48.652]  There's a whole host of things going on.
[00:28:48.672 --> 00:28:50.054]  I've been looking around for it.
[00:28:50.214 --> 00:28:53.398]  I covered it yesterday, and then I saw it back in my stack.
[00:28:53.418 --> 00:28:57.242]  Well, you guys in there, Google Bloomberg 12.8 trillion, and it is a
[00:29:02.065 --> 00:29:08.248]  Bloomberg article about how the real number now is $12.8 trillion approaching the gross domestic product of the nation.
[00:29:08.268 --> 00:29:13.930]  Since you're an economist and a successful one at that, I want to get your breakdown of what's happening.
[00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.672]  But first, they have announced that it's going to be a trillion and a half bucks for the bankers, but that's really the sideshow.
[00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:30.817]  As Dick Morris said on Fox News on Monday night, shockingly, he said, oh, the new world order is real, the conspiracy theorists were right, there's a global government where banks will rule the United States and the rest of the planet.
[00:29:31.817 --> 00:29:34.799]  And that they're talking about the money on one level, but they just issued that.
[00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:37.080]  The real issue is the regulatory power.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.441]  This quote, bank of the world that will rule everything.
[00:29:39.461 --> 00:29:47.865]  Can you, in your own words, speak to all of that and why suddenly we're seeing mainstream news have to admit we were right about all this?
[00:29:48.246 --> 00:29:54.229]  Well, clearly money has always been the strings of the puppeteers on the slaves.
[00:29:55.425 --> 00:30:08.914]  And the people, whether we call them the Illuminati, the black hats, the oligarchy, the plutocracy, the rascals, whatever we want to call these people who are living in separation consciousness, they have used fiat currency to
[00:30:10.795 --> 00:30:11.836]  As a manipulation.
[00:30:11.896 --> 00:30:13.836]  It's not money that they're after.
[00:30:14.076 --> 00:30:16.337]  It's what they're after is power.
[00:30:16.898 --> 00:30:19.679]  Cold, ruthless, total power.
[00:30:20.059 --> 00:30:23.280]  And they've been planning this for a long, long time.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.142]  Incrementally, since the days of Weishauf.
[00:30:27.862 --> 00:30:30.364]  And now they're in their final chapter.
[00:30:31.085 --> 00:30:42.915]  And the amount of money that you are talking about, and that is truly out there, most Americans think that this bailout, if they pay any attention, is three, maybe four trillion dollars.
[00:30:42.955 --> 00:30:47.179]  They don't have any idea what that, most people don't know what that really means.
[00:30:47.439 --> 00:30:52.924]  Three or four trillion dollars is an amount that staggers the mind.
[00:30:53.104 --> 00:30:54.345]  Staggers the mind.
[00:30:55.455 --> 00:31:09.257]  But however, the reality is, is that the Federal Reserve, with no accounting, with no supervision, is putting out another eight and a half to ten trillion dollars so far.
[00:31:09.757 --> 00:31:14.018]  They are not informing Congress or the people of this country where that money is going.
[00:31:14.518 --> 00:31:20.919]  And so the real number that is part of this, quote, bailout, and let's just get straight, this is not a bailout.
[00:31:21.339 --> 00:31:23.700]  This is financial terrorism.
[00:31:24.619 --> 00:31:25.780]  This is not a bailout.
[00:31:26.761 --> 00:31:28.462]  This is financial terrorism.
[00:31:29.263 --> 00:31:38.410]  And because Adam Weishauf, when they started the Illuminati, their motto was, out of chaos is order.
[00:31:38.811 --> 00:31:40.472]  Out of chaos is order.
[00:31:40.752 --> 00:31:50.800]  And when they went in to create the French Revolution, they created this chaos, the murders, blood was running in the street, they destroyed the economy so that they could get power.
[00:31:51.661 --> 00:31:54.784]  And they're doing the exact same thing here in the United States.
[00:31:55.285 --> 00:32:07.496]  This wonderful, wonderful nation is being destroyed, is destroyed, I shouldn't say is being, it is destroyed economically by the Federal Reserve, by the Treasury,
[00:32:08.217 --> 00:32:22.772]  And by these absolute rascals that are creating the greatest and most significant transfer of wealth in the history, not just of our country, but in all of Occidental history.
[00:32:24.193 --> 00:32:26.896]  The middle class, the productive peoples of this country,
[00:32:28.424 --> 00:32:37.911]  Black, White, Hispanic, Oriental, Christian, Jewish, the whole group, we're all being robbed as we speak.
[00:32:39.293 --> 00:32:42.435]  You cannot create wealth by creating more debt.
[00:32:43.316 --> 00:32:49.000]  You cannot create wealth by robbing and hindering the people who create the wealth.
[00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:54.825]  The state cannot, by definition, cannot create wealth.
[00:32:56.266 --> 00:33:05.053]  And the amazing thing is, is that 98% of this bailout money is going to financial institutions.
[00:33:06.675 --> 00:33:17.304]  Where, oh where, oh where, is it in the Constitution of the United States that the taxpayers of the United States should bail out corrupt
[00:33:18.547 --> 00:33:21.929]  Failing and wrong financial institutions.
[00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:40.541]  The very institutions that created and profited by this, starting in 1998 with this ending of the Glass-Steagall Act, and they took not millions, not billions, but trillions and trillions of dollars from the people, from the economy,
[00:33:41.161 --> 00:33:42.442]  Between 98 and now.
[00:33:43.122 --> 00:33:52.268]  And these very same people who planned this, who participated in this, are now getting the bailouts from the people of this country.
[00:33:52.548 --> 00:33:56.251]  That means you and me, your family and your friends.
[00:33:57.411 --> 00:33:58.912]  And that can only mean one thing.
[00:34:00.173 --> 00:34:03.175]  Extremely high taxes coming at us.
[00:34:04.156 --> 00:34:05.697]  More government interference.
[00:34:06.866 --> 00:34:08.887]  And eventually, mass inflation.
[00:34:09.447 --> 00:34:16.610]  Now, we're going to be in a significant debt deflationary period for a longer period of time than most people think.
[00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:19.811]  This bailout doesn't even come close.
[00:34:20.171 --> 00:34:26.074]  Let me repeat, this bailout doesn't even come close to sopping up these toxic derivatives.
[00:34:27.054 --> 00:34:32.297]  You know, and nobody really knows the exact number of the toxic derivatives out there.
[00:34:32.817 --> 00:34:39.120]  Whether it's $300 trillion, whether it's $500 trillion, or whether it's $800 or $900 trillion.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.861]  It really doesn't make any difference.
[00:34:41.321 --> 00:34:44.703]  Because the problem cannot be fixed.
[00:34:45.543 --> 00:34:48.845]  This bailout money doesn't even pay the interest.
[00:34:50.012 --> 00:34:51.614]  on these toxic derivatives.
[00:34:52.034 --> 00:34:53.296]  Friends, the game's all over.
[00:34:53.837 --> 00:35:04.269]  Using the rules of the Federal Reserve, Fractional Reserve Banking, fiat currency, the game was fixed many, many, many, many years ago.
[00:35:04.529 --> 00:35:05.730]  But now we're at the endgame.
[00:35:07.009 --> 00:35:11.031]  And most people don't even realize what fiat currency is.
[00:35:11.652 --> 00:35:14.273]  They don't understand what fractional reserve banking is.
[00:35:14.734 --> 00:35:34.085]  And most, many Americans, I'm sure that most people who are listening to this realize their founding fathers knew very, very clearly that to have a free nation is that we had to have our banking system controlled by the people, that we had to have a hard currency so that money had value.
[00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:38.782]  Money had value, but the large bankers came in.
[00:35:39.935 --> 00:35:43.598]  And they created fractional reserve banking.
[00:35:43.638 --> 00:35:47.121]  They created fractional banking and fiat currency.
[00:35:47.661 --> 00:36:06.315]  And since the beginning of this country, as I'm sure you've heard over and over again, has been the battle between the people and the populace who want to help the people of this country through a hard currency, through true money that has value, as opposed to the oligarchy, the small handful of people
[00:36:07.276 --> 00:36:10.997]  who control the strings and who make money a commodity.
[00:36:11.737 --> 00:36:18.899]  It doesn't take a PhD or even a Masters or even a degree in economics to figure this out.
[00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:27.261]  If you just take a few minutes, they are creating money out of thin air and then multiplying it and multiplying it and multiplying it.
[00:36:28.021 --> 00:36:37.503]  And then they are able to take your collateral, your business, your home, your auto, take it as collateral, and then you have to pay interest to them.
[00:36:38.003 --> 00:36:41.964]  It is the biggest Ponzi scheme in the history of this world.
[00:36:42.424 --> 00:36:55.146]  And because it is unsustainable, we are at the endgame right now, and Brother Obama and all of his buddies, like Geithner and the others, are just cutting the necks
[00:36:56.508 --> 00:37:04.091]  Of all the good people, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, rich, poor, everybody.
[00:37:04.911 --> 00:37:11.574]  And friends, this is what Alex and what other people have been sharing with you for the last 15 years.
[00:37:12.274 --> 00:37:13.514]  And the time is right now.
[00:37:14.155 --> 00:37:19.597]  And we can either see it with fear, or we can see it as a time of change, a time of shifting.
[00:37:20.297 --> 00:37:25.639]  And if we organize, if we organize, we can turn this thing around.
[00:37:27.341 --> 00:37:31.262]  Well, that's very well said, George Humphrey Economist, here visiting with us today.
[00:37:31.322 --> 00:37:34.603]  I've got a whole list of questions I want to go through with you.
[00:37:34.623 --> 00:37:38.645]  We can do this on-air part of it, and then off-air later for the film I'm making.
[00:37:38.665 --> 00:37:40.065]  They're going to be a big part of it.
[00:37:40.085 --> 00:37:50.868]  It'll be a lot more than the six or seven minutes you're in the previous film, because this one's going to be a lot more of you and Tarpley in it.
[00:37:52.649 --> 00:38:00.017]  Specifically, for people that don't understand fractional reserve banking, I mean, they know it's fiat, they know it's made out of nothing, but when we hear that
[00:38:01.104 --> 00:38:13.933]  When the public hears that trillions of dollars are being given to central banks, or that central banks are giving trillions of dollars to private banks, those private banks are the public component of the very same private bank, the Federal Reserve.
[00:38:14.113 --> 00:38:16.054]  It's a consortium or a combine.
[00:38:16.434 --> 00:38:24.620]  So they take our tax money to give their fiat value, they pay it to themselves, and to pay them our tax money, we then have to pay interest.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:30.944]  So we're not just paying in the money we give them for nothing, then we have to pay interest for the pleasure of giving them
[00:38:31.084 --> 00:38:36.845]  I mean, this is a Ponzi scheme of all Ponzi schemes to the power of infinity.
[00:38:37.286 --> 00:38:38.926]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:38:39.066 --> 00:38:41.827]  And it's happening right out in front of us.
[00:38:42.267 --> 00:38:51.729]  And they realize that they can do this because, as Adolf Hitler said, the bigger the lie, the easier it is to pull it off.
[00:38:52.389 --> 00:38:54.890]  And this is right in front of us.
[00:38:56.226 --> 00:39:02.090]  The Federal Reserve Board has the Treasury, orders the Treasury to print up, quote, money.
[00:39:02.871 --> 00:39:14.580]  And the Treasury takes paper and ink and prints this stuff up, and then the Fed pays the Treasury about two and a half or three cents on the dollar.
[00:39:15.652 --> 00:39:27.017]  And then they lend it to the Federal Reserve Regional Banks and then they lend it to the other banks and now they're not even doing that because they're starting to monetize the debt which we'll go into in a little bit.
[00:39:27.717 --> 00:39:30.398]  But these banks get money from the Fed
[00:39:32.611 --> 00:39:36.972]  And then they can lend it out at a ten to one level.
[00:39:37.772 --> 00:39:45.334]  So let's say that they get ten billion dollars so that they then can lend out a hundred or ninety million dollars.
[00:39:45.914 --> 00:39:46.594]  Billion dollars.
[00:39:47.174 --> 00:39:50.035]  And then when they get some of that money back... Start over on that.
[00:39:50.055 --> 00:39:50.615]  Start over on that.
[00:39:50.635 --> 00:39:50.815]  Okay.
[00:39:51.135 --> 00:39:57.397]  So let's say that a bank gets a hundred billion dollars from the Federal Reserve.
[00:39:59.028 --> 00:40:02.490]  And then they start lending that out at a nine to one level.
[00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:07.512]  So it's nine hundred billion dollars that they can lend out that's on their books.
[00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:14.336]  But then they get the money back and they put that in their quote reserves and then they can lend that out again.
[00:40:14.696 --> 00:40:17.958]  So their book value is not a hundred billion.
[00:40:18.398 --> 00:40:19.979]  It's not nine hundred billion.
[00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:25.401]  It's seventy two times the original amount that they have in.
[00:40:25.802 --> 00:40:28.423]  And this all starts with nothing.
[00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:44.567]  Paper and ink, and then they get the interest from the industries, from the small businesses, from the auto dealers, from the people cutting lawns, from you and me, that comes back.
[00:40:45.488 --> 00:40:48.648]  And it is money out of thin air.
[00:40:49.269 --> 00:40:54.390]  And the multiplication factors on this are so monstrous.
[00:40:56.802 --> 00:40:59.703]  And the multiplication factors used to be much smaller.
[00:41:00.003 --> 00:41:04.304]  It was still wrong then, but then they upped it, and upped it, and upped it, and upped it.
[00:41:05.085 --> 00:41:17.508]  And now, for every dollar that comes into a private bank, they can multiply, if they do their work properly, by 72 times.
[00:41:18.408 --> 00:41:23.890]  This is true insanity, considering that there is nothing there to begin with.
[00:41:24.665 --> 00:41:25.865]  And that's where derivatives come in.
[00:41:25.885 --> 00:41:30.346]  They need to keep pumping the bubble so they can skim the money off the top and buy real assets.
[00:41:30.606 --> 00:41:33.747]  And when it finally implodes, they leave us with the black hole of debt.
[00:41:34.087 --> 00:41:37.768]  They run off with all the real assets and say, we'll save you.
[00:41:38.028 --> 00:41:46.189]  We'll bring in a complete world tyranny and regulate every facet of your life and give you hundreds of new carbon taxes on everything you do.
[00:41:46.949 --> 00:41:49.450]  This is how we're going to fix everything.
[00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.171]  I mean, just amazing.
[00:41:51.191 --> 00:42:02.003]  So let's talk about where this is going, what this is going to do, how this is going to end, when we get back with George Humphrey, economist, author, lecturer, former Austin City Council member, and most important, my good buddy, coming up.
[00:42:02.123 --> 00:42:08.169]  He's in the current Obama deception, but he's also going to be in the new Obama film that's out July 4th.
[00:42:08.209 --> 00:42:08.670]  Stay with us.
[00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.311]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:42:11.432 --> 00:42:16.535]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:42:16.715 --> 00:42:18.056]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:42:18.316 --> 00:42:26.481]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:42:26.721 --> 00:42:32.445]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:42:32.605 --> 00:42:34.385]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:42:34.445 --> 00:42:36.606]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:42:36.626 --> 00:42:40.987]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:42:41.167 --> 00:42:43.288]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:42:43.388 --> 00:42:51.210]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.871]  In the New World Order's war against humanity
[00:43:12.461 --> 00:43:14.585]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:43:15.086 --> 00:43:22.100]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:43:22.674 --> 00:43:28.856]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:43:29.257 --> 00:43:31.077]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:43:31.217 --> 00:43:33.638]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:43:33.718 --> 00:43:44.683]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:43:45.303 --> 00:43:46.583]  It's not about left or right.
[00:43:46.983 --> 00:43:48.324]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:43:48.852 --> 00:43:49.412]  You worry.
[00:43:49.472 --> 00:43:52.574]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:43:52.594 --> 00:43:55.895]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:43:55.935 --> 00:43:58.736]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:21.951]  We're good to go!
[00:44:50.489 --> 00:44:52.191]  How to prepare, use and store it.

[00:45:20.413 --> 00:45:23.555]  My websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:45:23.575 --> 00:45:30.100]  We're simulcasting for all our great PrisonPlanet.tv members on the TV end with the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.622]  George Humphrey with us until the end of the transmission today.
[00:45:33.042 --> 00:45:34.583]  And I got a million questions for you, George.
[00:45:34.643 --> 00:45:36.744]  So, we were getting into the point of explaining.
[00:45:37.685 --> 00:45:45.989]  And I know most of the audience knows this, but your neighbors, your friends, your family, they just think the bankers screwed up, and, boy, we've got to give them all this money, and it's financial terrorism.
[00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:50.091]  They say, give us all this power, or everything's going to end, everything's going to fall apart.
[00:45:50.631 --> 00:45:57.875]  When they're all rubbing their hands together, laughing, giggling, writing white papers how they engineered it, laughing at how they're going to destroy the middle class.
[00:45:57.915 --> 00:46:01.757]  I mean, this is how we knew all this was going to happen, because these guys all bragged about it.
[00:46:01.777 --> 00:46:02.737]  We'd say, look at this book!
[00:46:02.977 --> 00:46:03.758]  Look at this document!
[00:46:03.798 --> 00:46:04.358]  They wrote it!
[00:46:04.658 --> 00:46:05.739]  They're going to do this!
[00:46:06.719 --> 00:46:09.001]  You know, wrote books about this 12 years ago.
[00:46:10.062 --> 00:46:11.143]  And now it's all here.
[00:46:11.163 --> 00:46:12.664]  And he said, the derivatives, the derivatives.
[00:46:12.684 --> 00:46:23.673]  I mean, I remember listening to books on tape you made, you know, in 1998, driving around in my car, and hearing you talk about derivatives, derivatives, and you're an economist.
[00:46:23.693 --> 00:46:25.835]  So they knew they were setting this up.
[00:46:25.855 --> 00:46:26.836]  So let's go back to George.
[00:46:26.896 --> 00:46:31.339]  Break down how this fiat system works and how it's going to end.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.142]  What they want to set up through making us dependent.
[00:46:34.861 --> 00:46:38.684]  Well, the fiat system is a system of theft.
[00:46:39.225 --> 00:46:41.086]  And it's been around for a long, long time.
[00:46:41.126 --> 00:46:47.472]  And that's why in the Bible is that there are 17 references not against usury.
[00:46:47.972 --> 00:47:00.843]  But the reality is, is that the central bankers realize that by using fiat currency is that they can create so-called money out of nothing.
[00:47:01.854 --> 00:47:04.217]  They can create so-called money out of nothing.
[00:47:04.577 --> 00:47:15.951]  And if they can convince the people that they have something of value, which they have done, and a fiat is simply means the declaration of the king or the president.
[00:47:16.031 --> 00:47:18.794]  And so that's why we call it fiat currency.
[00:47:19.395 --> 00:47:27.461]  And so what was done is that in 1913, with the creation of the Federal Reserve Banking Act, is the Federal Reserve was created.
[00:47:27.501 --> 00:47:36.989]  And of course, all of you I'm sure are aware, the Federal Reserve is not federal, there's no reserves, and it is owned by European bankers for the most part.
[00:47:37.469 --> 00:47:38.570]  It's never been accounted.
[00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:42.513]  The GAO has never been able to come in and take a look at it.
[00:47:43.053 --> 00:47:53.782]  And what they do is that they, and according to Greenspan, they are a completely independent agency that is above the law of the United States.
[00:47:54.222 --> 00:47:56.805]  And Greenspan just said this last week on television.
[00:47:56.885 --> 00:47:58.026]  It's just truly amazing.
[00:47:58.726 --> 00:48:03.409]  And so what they do is that they order the Treasury to print up money.
[00:48:03.769 --> 00:48:07.171]  Now money for them is just basically paper and ink.
[00:48:07.892 --> 00:48:17.258]  Then they take this so-called money and lend it to the Federal Reserve regional banks in Dallas and New York and San Francisco and Denver.
[00:48:17.858 --> 00:48:18.018]  I think?
[00:48:36.497 --> 00:48:46.222]  Is that they get a certain interest back, but then the private banks can put that on their books and let's say that they borrow a billion dollars.
[00:48:46.802 --> 00:48:50.124]  They can lend out ten billion dollars.
[00:48:52.119 --> 00:49:03.346]  And then as the people start paying that money back, and let's say they pay that money back, then they can lend that out again at another percentage.
[00:49:03.927 --> 00:49:14.833]  And so after a period of time, the bank that has borrowed one billion dollars, which is out of thin air in the first place, which is basically paper and ink,
[00:49:15.754 --> 00:49:44.870]  has assets on their books of seventy two times so a bank that has borrowed one million dollars after let's say a year and a half or two years has up to seventy billion dollars on their books now clearly there's nothing there as far as real value however for all the many many thousands of people that they have lent the money to they have to pay back the principal
[00:49:45.651 --> 00:49:46.933]  Alright, stay there.
[00:49:46.973 --> 00:49:48.235]  Back in 70 seconds.
[00:49:49.677 --> 00:49:51.060]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:54.506]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:49:58.851 --> 00:50:00.432]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:00.532 --> 00:50:05.154]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:05.274 --> 00:50:08.035]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:08.235 --> 00:50:11.096]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:50:11.256 --> 00:50:15.998]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:50:16.218 --> 00:50:17.139]  If you simply prepare.
[00:50:17.359 --> 00:50:20.341]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:50:20.581 --> 00:50:27.485]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:50:27.585 --> 00:50:30.707]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:50:53.624 --> 00:50:54.604]  Take action today.
[00:50:54.764 --> 00:50:56.546]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:01.562 --> 00:51:03.463]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:03.943 --> 00:51:06.725]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:51:29.614 --> 00:51:31.075]  All right, George Humphrey is our guest.
[00:51:31.095 --> 00:51:33.057]  Your calls are coming up at about the 20 after.
[00:51:33.697 --> 00:51:36.640]  I have a lot of questions I want to go over with George.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.842]  So it's all fiat currency.
[00:51:38.922 --> 00:51:45.147]  About 1.5% of all the fiat money they've got out there in zeros and ones and computers is physical paper money.
[00:51:45.227 --> 00:51:54.854]  You've got people then who lose their houses, their cars, their lives for just made-up fiat, but it's a contract they've signed, so it's through contract fraud.
[00:51:55.695 --> 00:51:57.877]  So this is a institutional fraud.
[00:51:57.917 --> 00:52:04.282]  This is an institutional fraud that makes Madoff, who was one of the top guys in this, look like a choir boy.
[00:52:05.002 --> 00:52:10.246]  George, I want to go through a whole section of important questions here, but we've just witnessed...
[00:52:11.107 --> 00:52:15.971]  Well, I would call one of the most important dates in the march of world government, this world tyranny.
[00:52:16.311 --> 00:52:29.821]  They're openly agreed today, 1.5 trillion for this new international body to issue their own monetized IMF World Bank super currency that the United States will now fully go under the control of this system as every other nation will.
[00:52:29.841 --> 00:52:31.142]  They're calling it a world government.
[00:52:31.482 --> 00:52:32.743]  They're saying and suddenly
[00:52:33.644 --> 00:52:42.691]  Yeti N. Davignon, in the EU Observer, gave an interview, this is up on InfoWars.com, and he bragged, it says, suddenly they're admitting world government, Bilderberg.
[00:52:42.711 --> 00:52:54.620]  They say, oh, at a meeting in June in Europe, the Bilderberg Group, an informal club of leading politicians, businessmen, and thinkers, chaired by Mr. Davignon, could also improve understanding on future action, the same way it helped create the Euro in the 1990s, he said.
[00:52:56.121 --> 00:53:13.877]  And it says, he goes on to say, when we were having debates on the Euro, people at Bilderberg events could explain why it was worth taking risk and others, for whom the formal policy was not believed in it yet, we were not obliged not to listen and had to stand up and come up with real arguments.
[00:53:13.917 --> 00:53:18.781]  So, we've gotten some Bilderberg documents before where they admit they set up the Euro, but here they are admitting it.
[00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:22.465]  This is the group behind the European Union, the American Union, North American Union,
[00:53:22.825 --> 00:53:24.426]  You know, all of these things that are happening.
[00:53:24.866 --> 00:53:28.389]  So that's my question for you now, and then what will this system look like if they're successful?
[00:53:28.909 --> 00:53:37.175]  Why now is Fox News and CNN coming out and saying, it is a world government, we will be ruled by a group of private bankers, but it's good.
[00:53:37.435 --> 00:53:40.077]  Or some of the shows say, it might be bad.
[00:53:40.097 --> 00:53:46.321]  You know, all these years, all these years they knew this, so what does it mean now to have them emerging and admitting it?
[00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:58.746]  Well, quite clearly the G20 meeting that is taking place right now is the vortex of energy for the movement toward a total World Bank and thus, and very shortly, a world government.
[00:53:59.126 --> 00:54:07.830]  They realize, the Illuminati realize, that with the impetus, with the momentum of the election of Barack Obama,
[00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:15.555]  And he is just one of the most amazing actors in the history of Western politics.
[00:54:15.575 --> 00:54:30.427]  He's much ahead of Ronald Reagan, is that they have to act very, very quickly, because very, very quickly also, the people of this world are waking up to the reality of the facade and the deception of Obama and his administration.
[00:54:31.187 --> 00:54:47.294]  And you and I have been aware of this for a long, long, long time, is that their tentacles are going out further and further and further, and that this G20 meeting is nothing more than creating a world bank right now.
[00:54:47.874 --> 00:54:48.975]  Now if that happens,
[00:54:49.815 --> 00:54:55.298]  And the United States dollar no longer is the reserve currency of this world.
[00:54:56.078 --> 00:55:04.282]  Katie, bar the door for all the families, for all the businesses, for all the people of the United States.
[00:55:05.811 --> 00:55:10.797]  We have prospered for the last 50 years because the U.S.
[00:55:10.877 --> 00:55:13.079]  dollar was the reserve currency.
[00:55:14.301 --> 00:55:22.450]  And because of massive, massive greed, because of massive incompetence, because of theft,
[00:55:23.291 --> 00:55:28.413]  And because of every sort of shenanigans you can think of, the U.S.
[00:55:28.453 --> 00:55:41.857]  Treasury and the Fed have completely and 100% debased not only the economy of this nation, but the retirements and the future, economic future for the people of this country.
[00:55:42.197 --> 00:55:44.177]  This is really, really big stuff, friends.
[00:55:44.658 --> 00:55:48.839]  And this situation is so, so much bigger.
[00:55:49.739 --> 00:55:52.681]  than 99% of the people in this country understand.
[00:55:52.721 --> 00:55:56.124]  Well, the elite admit this is a world revolution, a sign of a dictatorship.
[00:55:56.444 --> 00:56:02.588]  Let's come back, run through a laundry list of important questions I've got for you, then take calls for the balance of this transmission.
[00:56:02.928 --> 00:56:05.790]  Right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network, your time for Ian Studio.
[00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:06.631]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:56:09.493 --> 00:56:12.335]  Hello, this is Tom with hempusa.org.
[00:56:12.855 --> 00:56:15.457]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months.
[00:56:16.089 --> 00:56:20.031]  And it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[00:56:20.592 --> 00:56:27.836]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[00:56:28.416 --> 00:56:34.760]  At hempusa.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.

[00:57:07.947 --> 00:57:11.890]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:57:12.483 --> 00:57:14.607]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:57:15.108 --> 00:57:22.141]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:57:22.671 --> 00:57:28.877]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:57:29.257 --> 00:57:31.099]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:57:31.239 --> 00:57:33.661]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:57:33.742 --> 00:57:44.692]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:57:45.302 --> 00:57:46.603]  It's not about left or right.
[00:57:46.983 --> 00:57:48.383]  It's about a one world government.
[00:57:48.843 --> 00:57:55.166]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:58:04.009 --> 00:58:05.149]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:06.770]  The people strike back.
[00:58:08.544 --> 00:58:12.367]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[00:58:12.527 --> 00:58:17.271]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.
[00:58:17.391 --> 00:58:20.133]  You may think I'm crazy, but I know my identity is safe.

[00:58:51.952 --> 00:58:52.372]  I don't know.
[00:59:13.832 --> 00:59:18.013]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:18.673 --> 00:59:19.494]  You want answers?
[00:59:20.234 --> 00:59:21.154]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:21.794 --> 00:59:25.435]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:25.995 --> 00:59:30.056]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:41.045 --> 00:59:44.531]  George, you've studied the New World Order, their own writings, their own statements.
[00:59:45.051 --> 00:59:52.983]  What will life be like under the New World Order if they're able to get the full system in place, this global regulatory micromanaging system?
[00:59:54.025 --> 00:59:55.466]  Wow, that's a big question Alex.
[00:59:56.047 --> 01:00:05.976]  And it's one that is, we really don't know, but we do know this, that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:00:06.476 --> 01:00:07.177]  This we know.
[01:00:07.718 --> 01:00:12.242]  Now the question is, is whether our slave masters would be
[01:00:14.225 --> 01:00:27.969]  Liberals, in which they would just allow us to be and they would have full control of us, but they would cut off all of our freedoms and give us things like sports and entertainment to keep us occupied.
[01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:32.971]  By the way, as you know, they have open discussions about that in major globalist publications.
[01:00:33.271 --> 01:00:33.832]  Absolutely.
[01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:44.580]  Or whether they're going to be more tyrannical in which they have repeatedly said that they need to cull the population down to less than a billion.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.123]  That means that five out of every six people of this planet would be eliminated.
[01:00:49.944 --> 01:00:52.086]  Now when you think about these concepts,
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:54.721]  They seem so far out.
[01:00:54.801 --> 01:01:01.683]  How could somebody like Barack Obama, who seems to have such kind eyes, be part of this?
[01:01:02.163 --> 01:01:07.906]  But all we have to do is go back in history, not 5,000 years or 2,000 years or even 500 years, but just in the last century.
[01:01:12.366 --> 01:01:20.113]  When Stalin came in, he eliminated over 25 million people of his own nation.
[01:01:20.773 --> 01:01:31.963]  He completely closed off the Ukraine and starved to death 14 million Russians because they weren't going along with his policies.
[01:01:33.567 --> 01:01:41.992]  Mao Zedong, another very, very charismatic guy, comes in and promises a new way, a better life.
[01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:53.919]  Five years later, 55 to 60 million educated and working Chinese people have been exterminated.
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:02:00.043]  So to believe that this cannot happen is just denial.
[01:02:01.072 --> 01:02:05.114]  Now that's why Alex is here, that's why I'm here, that's why you're listening.
[01:02:05.974 --> 01:02:11.077]  My intention and my focus is not to let us go down that path.
[01:02:11.857 --> 01:02:22.643]  An ounce of prevention, it's going to take a lot more of an ounce of prevention right now, is worth a pound of cure, but it's going to take the combined efforts of everyone
[01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:42.166]  Not just Alex and myself or David Icke or whoever, but you, the people listening out there, to first get yourself informed and to realize the real severity, the real seriousness, the reality of this point of time in our world.
[01:02:43.067 --> 01:02:48.611]  And all the prophecies for the last 4,000 years have pointed to this period of time.
[01:02:49.152 --> 01:02:55.237]  Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Hopi Indians, Nostradamus, the whole group of people.
[01:02:55.597 --> 01:03:06.906]  But it doesn't take a prophecy to understand of the incredible first economic, then political, then cultural danger or changes that are taking place.
[01:03:07.844 --> 01:03:13.367]  Now if we react in fear, then we're going to go right down their path.
[01:03:14.008 --> 01:03:19.371]  Because quite clearly, they have more money, they have more guns, they have more organization.
[01:03:19.971 --> 01:03:22.673]  But we have the secret weapon up our sleeves.
[01:03:23.453 --> 01:03:25.896]  And that is the universal truth.
[01:03:25.916 --> 01:03:29.921]  That is what many of us call God.
[01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:32.825]  Because God doesn't create junk.
[01:03:32.965 --> 01:03:38.713]  And the universal creator of this planet doesn't want us to wipe ourselves out.
[01:03:40.131 --> 01:03:41.893]  We don't need to go down this road.
[01:03:42.313 --> 01:03:44.295]  And we have plenty of brain power.
[01:03:44.335 --> 01:03:45.617]  We have plenty of courage.
[01:03:46.037 --> 01:03:49.901]  We have plenty of ability to turn this thing around.
[01:03:50.481 --> 01:03:52.484]  But we have to do it right now.
[01:03:53.264 --> 01:03:55.507]  And it starts with correct information.
[01:03:56.536 --> 01:04:08.000]  Then it takes a determination that you are going to stand up for what is right and just, and to connect with your friends, your family, your co-workers, to educate them.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.201]  And then it is to organize people.
[01:04:10.601 --> 01:04:15.443]  And we have the Constitution, the Republic, history on our side.
[01:04:16.363 --> 01:04:18.604]  We are not the bad guys in this situation.
[01:04:35.791 --> 01:04:59.961]  Specifically to the issue that so many people before us, and then today, and what we've been doing for the last 15 years or so, you longer, the fact that we did read the Globalist documents, we did warn people, the power of the fact that we planted those seeds, they're now sprouting, there's never been such an awakening, and planting seeds now, people, some of them won't listen, but as the next phase of what we say comes true, because we have our own blueprint,
[01:05:00.601 --> 01:05:05.506]  Then our credibility gets even greater, and that in that is going to be our victory.
[01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:08.189]  It doesn't mean we're not going to go deep into the battle in the arena.
[01:05:08.209 --> 01:05:10.271]  It doesn't mean a lot of us aren't going to make it through this.
[01:05:10.851 --> 01:05:18.639]  It means that you have to understand this is part of destiny, humanity, a human choice, bigger than even the individual, in the whole development of the human species.
[01:05:18.659 --> 01:05:19.900]  This is what makes us strong.
[01:05:20.161 --> 01:05:24.345]  The wheat from the chaff, the gold from the lesser metals,
[01:05:24.685 --> 01:05:25.966]  This is the purification.
[01:05:26.226 --> 01:05:27.307]  This is the great test.
[01:05:27.347 --> 01:05:34.431]  This is the great culmination, the great battle, as humans prepare to become a Type 1 civilization, meaning survival of the species off planet.
[01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:41.275]  As we prepare, you know, literally like a caterpillar about to turn into a butterfly, the globalists don't want that going to the next level.
[01:05:41.876 --> 01:05:45.778]  Well, absolutely, Alex, and you say it so well, and quite clearly, this is a
[01:05:48.231 --> 01:05:51.914]  A situation that has been going on for a long, long time.
[01:05:52.455 --> 01:06:11.172]  People such as George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Mr. Ford from the Ford Motor Company, Charles Lindbergh, John Kennedy, Barry Goldwater, all were very clear about the dangers of globalism and the New World Order.
[01:06:12.233 --> 01:06:24.699]  And that's why our founding fathers, to a person, wrote about the decentralization of power, the keeping power in the states, and returning power to the individuals.
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:27.001]  That's why we have the Bill of Rights.
[01:06:27.441 --> 01:06:29.102]  And is our Constitution perfect?
[01:06:29.742 --> 01:06:36.446]  No, but it's probably the best constitution and the best republic that has ever been created on this planet.
[01:06:36.646 --> 01:06:45.151]  And I for one am 100% behind the concepts and the higher ideals of our republic.
[01:06:45.471 --> 01:06:48.993]  Now the question is, is what are we going to do about this?
[01:06:49.133 --> 01:06:50.894]  And the first thing is that we have to wake up.
[01:06:51.434 --> 01:06:59.159]  There are clearly people out there, there are clearly these souls out there that have what I consider to be a vampire consciousness.
[01:06:59.559 --> 01:07:07.924]  They believe that the only way that they are going to survive is by sucking the blood or the nutrition or the life force from others.
[01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:12.987]  And it is actually that bizarre at one different level.
[01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:21.654]  Now clearly, then there are the other people such as Alex and myself who realize that this universe is infinite.
[01:07:22.194 --> 01:07:23.616]  There is infinite love.
[01:07:23.656 --> 01:07:25.258]  There is infinite abundance.
[01:07:25.678 --> 01:07:31.005]  There is infinite ability for all of us on this planet to live a healthy,
[01:07:31.525 --> 01:07:38.872]  A positive, meaningful life, if we work together with cooperation and under the rule of law.
[01:07:39.892 --> 01:07:44.597]  Laws that are equal and just for all people, just like in the Republic.
[01:07:45.457 --> 01:07:50.142]  And that is what we, we are on the side of real law.
[01:07:50.802 --> 01:07:58.349]  The people who are in Washington, who have all the guns, all the money, are breaking the laws right in front of us.
[01:07:59.474 --> 01:08:07.464]  Now, in the vampire consciousness, they also have a rule that they have to tell us what they're going to do before they do it.
[01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:14.592]  And there was a movie about ten years ago called Wag the Dog, in which it showed about how President Clinton
[01:08:15.653 --> 01:08:20.596]  had to create a war to get out of a situation with his intern.
[01:08:21.217 --> 01:08:27.901]  This movie was in the can six months before Bosnia or any of the other escapades took place.
[01:08:28.501 --> 01:08:37.127]  They always, these people in the Illuminati, are under a very deep secret societies that have their own laws.
[01:08:37.687 --> 01:08:39.969]  And they do tell us what they're going to do.
[01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:45.830]  And Alex and others have read these things and we know what they want to do.
[01:08:47.311 --> 01:08:48.871]  It is not just about money.
[01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:50.952]  It's about power.
[01:08:51.532 --> 01:08:52.772]  Let me repeat that again.
[01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:54.332]  It's not just about money.
[01:08:54.392 --> 01:08:56.253]  They're taking our money and they've got our money now.
[01:08:56.693 --> 01:08:57.773]  Now it's about power.
[01:08:58.794 --> 01:09:04.455]  Now the question is, is that they can only take our power is if we give it to them.
[01:09:05.686 --> 01:09:16.513]  And clearly I and many, many other hundreds of thousands of people and maybe millions of people are becoming aware and saying, no, you're not going to do that.
[01:09:16.933 --> 01:09:17.894]  This is my life.
[01:09:18.314 --> 01:09:19.335]  This is my state.
[01:09:19.655 --> 01:09:20.536]  This is my country.
[01:09:20.596 --> 01:09:21.536]  This is my world.
[01:09:21.897 --> 01:09:23.458]  And we're not going to play your games.
[01:09:24.658 --> 01:09:29.962]  And friends, when I first became aware of this, it scared the heck out of me.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:37.385]  But then, as time went on, I found all these wonderful and vibrant new people.
[01:09:37.865 --> 01:09:53.517]  People who were alive in their spirit, who had beautiful hearts, who were so much... Instead of just talking about, how about those Longhorns, or how about those Rangers, or how about, you know, whatever it was, all the dra... You know, and I'm a sports fan.
[01:09:53.577 --> 01:09:55.419]  I'm a total sports junkie.
[01:09:55.879 --> 01:09:58.921]  But there's bigger and more exciting things to talk about also.
[01:09:59.722 --> 01:10:03.984]  And there is no better game in the world right now.
[01:10:04.504 --> 01:10:07.546]  And I say game in a very fanciful way.
[01:10:07.606 --> 01:10:08.266]  It's life and death.
[01:10:08.406 --> 01:10:09.727]  It's life and death.
[01:10:09.907 --> 01:10:12.628]  This is a very serious situation.
[01:10:12.648 --> 01:10:18.931]  Well, that's what the British overlords in open books, they write, call how they play countries off against each other, how they control both parties, the manipulation.
[01:10:18.951 --> 01:10:20.692]  They call it the great game.
[01:10:20.932 --> 01:10:21.492]  Absolutely.
[01:10:21.532 --> 01:10:22.472]  And it is a great game.
[01:10:22.553 --> 01:10:24.353]  It's like a chessboard game to them.
[01:10:24.774 --> 01:10:27.775]  Because for them, human life has no value.
[01:10:29.071 --> 01:10:36.862]  Again, for them, most of the people who are in the epicenter of the Illuminati, the power elite, are basically atheists.
[01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:40.547]  They are materialistic, secular atheists.
[01:10:41.468 --> 01:10:43.431]  And I have a different point of view about life.
[01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:45.974]  I believe that life is divine.
[01:10:47.173 --> 01:10:52.156]  I believe it is spiritual, I believe it is loving, and I believe that there is purpose.
[01:10:52.196 --> 01:10:57.960]  And every single person on this planet has a purpose and a reason for being here.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:00.681]  I need you to take up that destiny to truly go to the next level.
[01:11:01.081 --> 01:11:02.302]  You're not truly living until you do that.
[01:11:02.322 --> 01:11:02.923]  We've got a break.
[01:11:03.383 --> 01:11:03.823]  Come back.
[01:11:03.903 --> 01:11:05.024]  Your phone call is straight ahead.
[01:11:05.084 --> 01:11:06.645]  George Humphrey in studio with us.
[01:11:09.013 --> 01:11:10.514]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:11:10.695 --> 01:11:12.156]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:11:12.436 --> 01:11:14.578]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:11:15.018 --> 01:11:19.783]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:11:20.163 --> 01:11:23.026]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:11:23.346 --> 01:11:26.869]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:11:27.259 --> 01:11:39.253]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:11:39.814 --> 01:11:41.796]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:11:41.816 --> 01:11:43.118]  I use one every day.
[01:11:43.538 --> 01:11:45.861]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:11:46.241 --> 01:11:46.942]  We're good to go.
[01:12:08.988 --> 01:12:09.968]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:12:10.048 --> 01:12:14.831]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:12:14.991 --> 01:12:22.794]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:12:23.054 --> 01:12:28.417]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:12:28.637 --> 01:12:35.600]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:41.222]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:46.244]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:12:46.564 --> 01:12:54.186]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:12:54.507 --> 01:13:00.749]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:13:01.069 --> 01:13:02.189]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:04.932 --> 01:13:07.196]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:08.939 --> 01:13:14.188]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:14.973 --> 01:13:20.338]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:20.858 --> 01:13:27.043]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:27.343 --> 01:13:29.185]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:29.325 --> 01:13:31.707]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:13:31.787 --> 01:13:42.676]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:13:44.975 --> 01:13:46.236]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:46.636 --> 01:13:48.017]  It's about a one world government.
[01:13:48.498 --> 01:13:54.823]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:13:55.403 --> 01:14:03.189]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:04.811]  The Obama Deception.
[01:14:05.251 --> 01:14:06.432]  The people strike back.
[01:14:08.195 --> 01:14:11.818]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:14:11.898 --> 01:14:17.523]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:14:17.644 --> 01:14:21.707]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:14:21.987 --> 01:14:24.270]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:30.355]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:14:30.495 --> 01:14:31.035]  We're good to go!
[01:14:59.514 --> 01:15:02.275]  Okay, Ravel, Nathan, Brian, Mark, Sean, and others, we're going to your calls right now.
[01:15:24.249 --> 01:15:27.490]  Then folks will have to wait until the second Obama film comes out to hear all these questions.
[01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:29.311]  I've got about 50 of them here for you, George.
[01:15:29.771 --> 01:15:32.632]  We're going to rock it through after the show.
[01:15:34.032 --> 01:15:37.674]  But Ravel in Pennsylvania, you are on the air.
[01:15:37.734 --> 01:15:38.094]  Welcome.
[01:15:40.415 --> 01:15:42.055]  We went through this the last time I called.
[01:15:42.915 --> 01:15:44.696]  Oh yeah, I forgot to give George headphones.
[01:15:44.716 --> 01:15:47.137]  Is there a pair there on the ground for you, George?
[01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:50.551]  They must have run off with them after they had them plugged in.
[01:15:50.591 --> 01:15:52.092]  Will somebody get George some headphones?
[01:15:52.492 --> 01:15:54.933]  Okay, Ravel, go ahead and ask me a question while we're getting him headphones.
[01:15:55.354 --> 01:16:12.403]  Okay, the census, they're putting millions of dollars into refining the census, fencing us, because people are homeless and the foreigners, you know, whatever, immigrants, whatever, and they're trying, they said that they were going to take the stimulus money and take millions of dollars
[01:16:13.036 --> 01:16:16.538]  I have the complete answer for you since you asked the question.
[01:16:16.578 --> 01:16:18.459]  Would you like me to tell you exactly what's going on?
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.563]  Okay, well your instincts are correct there.
[01:16:32.583 --> 01:16:46.756]  Remember the big battle in 2000 when they said the census now isn't just how many people live in your house, but it's a 54 question deal and then one out of six families got a multi-hundred one saying, do you own firearms?
[01:16:46.776 --> 01:16:47.917]  What type of toilet do you have?
[01:16:48.298 --> 01:16:49.899]  What stocks and bonds do you have?
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.443]  And then they started doing a business census and a farming census
[01:16:53.883 --> 01:17:03.887]  And in the Constitution they can only ask how many people live here to apportion the states to decide how many members of the House of Representatives your state get for representation in voting.
[01:17:04.147 --> 01:17:07.629]  That's why California has the most members of Congress, they have the biggest population.
[01:17:07.969 --> 01:17:11.170]  Texas has the second amount, and Florida and so on and so forth.
[01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:12.591]  That's all the census is for.
[01:17:13.051 --> 01:17:16.012]  Now the census is this Fifth Amendment violating.
[01:17:16.032 --> 01:17:17.953]  You're not supposed to be able to answer questions even under torture.
[01:17:19.073 --> 01:17:22.935]  And they just mail you it, and then I got the big 54 question.
[01:17:23.155 --> 01:17:25.877]  I think every three homes got that, every six homes got the multi-hunter.
[01:17:25.917 --> 01:17:29.098]  When I was here, everybody talking about it, I got in the mail the 54 question.
[01:17:30.495 --> 01:17:33.838]  And I said, me and my wife live here with my girlfriend at the time.
[01:17:34.119 --> 01:17:34.679]  We're now married.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.100]  I said, there's two people here.
[01:17:36.481 --> 01:17:37.602]  And I filled it out and mailed it back.
[01:17:37.642 --> 01:17:39.524]  And a young punk came to my door.
[01:17:39.944 --> 01:17:46.070]  And I'll never forget, he parked halfway out in the street, kind of blocking the road over there where I lived.
[01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.931]  I told the story on air.
[01:17:46.951 --> 01:17:48.713]  I even have video of it somewhere, never aired it.
[01:17:48.973 --> 01:17:49.573]  I got a video camera.
[01:17:49.594 --> 01:17:50.635]  I go to the door and go, what do you want?
[01:17:51.195 --> 01:17:52.756]  He goes, listen, he has a little badge.
[01:17:52.797 --> 01:17:54.558]  He goes, you're going to be arrested if you don't fill this out.
[01:17:54.578 --> 01:17:55.219]  Go show me the law.
[01:17:55.699 --> 01:17:56.360]  He goes, what's the law?
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:56.960]  And I said, no.
[01:17:57.221 --> 01:17:58.161]  Here's the census form.
[01:17:58.201 --> 01:17:59.763]  It says you've only got to answer this question.
[01:18:00.283 --> 01:18:01.364]  And it threatens you with law.
[01:18:02.125 --> 01:18:03.987]  Up at the top of the form, it's illegal fraud.
[01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:05.628]  But down here, there's all these questions.
[01:18:05.728 --> 01:18:06.609]  I'm not answering it.
[01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:07.230]  Get out of here.
[01:18:07.630 --> 01:18:08.251]  And he wouldn't leave.
[01:18:08.291 --> 01:18:09.492]  And I stepped out and I said, did you hear me?
[01:18:09.512 --> 01:18:10.312]  I'm going to call the police.
[01:18:11.013 --> 01:18:20.297]  But see, most people buckle, and so now they're saying it's going to be first a yearly census, now a monthly census, and you're just going to have constant questions from the government.
[01:18:20.317 --> 01:18:24.539]  They threaten, and just like there's no law to take vaccines, but they say, we'll arrest you if you don't do this.
[01:18:25.179 --> 01:18:26.159]  George, you want to comment on that?
[01:18:26.479 --> 01:18:32.602]  Well, it's in the Constitution, and the Constitution is very clear, and you can't ask any other questions about who lives in your household.
[01:18:33.062 --> 01:18:33.402]  Period.
[01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:33.963]  Paragraph.
[01:18:34.023 --> 01:18:34.603]  End of sentence.
[01:18:35.183 --> 01:18:38.086]  And either we have a Constitution or we don't have a Constitution.
[01:18:38.506 --> 01:18:43.831]  And it's like if you're playing a game of cards, does four of a kind beat two pair?
[01:18:43.871 --> 01:18:44.632]  Of course it does.
[01:18:45.052 --> 01:18:47.895]  But if they change the rules in the middle of the game, you get cheated.
[01:18:48.456 --> 01:18:54.001]  And I personally like the rules of the Constitution that are equal and just for all people.
[01:18:54.884 --> 01:18:55.805]  It's dog training.
[01:18:55.825 --> 01:19:01.889]  They just constantly, with peer pressure and with a badge, with a uniform, you know, just say, this is the way it is.
[01:19:01.989 --> 01:19:07.173]  Well, it's absolute intimidation and it's also mind control together with ignorance.
[01:19:07.294 --> 01:19:18.142]  And I really want to stress the fact that the people of this nation are far, far more controlled subconsciously than they have any idea about.
[01:19:18.562 --> 01:19:36.692]  And this has been going on for years and years and years through the television, through our schools, through the food we eat, through all the political correctness, and the people of this country don't even realize how enslaved they are.
[01:19:37.192 --> 01:19:37.772]  Absolutely.
[01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:40.153]  Ravel, your instincts are correct.
[01:19:40.173 --> 01:19:40.694]  Anything else?
[01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:44.896]  Okay, Nathan in Seattle.
[01:19:45.216 --> 01:19:46.077]  Nathan, you're on the air.
[01:19:46.097 --> 01:19:46.477]  Go ahead.
[01:19:47.768 --> 01:19:48.689]  Alex, thanks.
[01:19:49.049 --> 01:19:55.572]  I was calling because I wanted to plug, wanted to know if you ever had Ellen Brown on.
[01:19:56.333 --> 01:20:00.055]  And next thing was that I'm also calling because I don't really agree with George.
[01:20:00.875 --> 01:20:02.096]  I'm an atheist patriot.
[01:20:02.896 --> 01:20:08.799]  And I think the kind of rhetoric he's talking about is not really helpful because... Well, sir, he wasn't saying... Hold on a minute.
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.821]  He wasn't saying you are New World Order.
[01:20:12.121 --> 01:20:15.063]  He was saying how the globalists identify most of themselves.
[01:20:16.447 --> 01:20:16.927]  Correct, George?
[01:20:16.967 --> 01:20:17.307]  Correct.
[01:20:17.367 --> 01:20:21.750]  And part of the Constitution is freedom of religion and beliefs.
[01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:24.632]  And if that is your belief, so be it.
[01:20:24.992 --> 01:20:36.320]  That's not my belief, but if I believe in the Constitution and real freedom, I allow you to be a Lutheran, or a Catholic, or a Jew, or an atheist, and we can all live together.
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.101]  Nathan, do you want to come back and make any more comments?
[01:20:38.871 --> 01:20:39.071]  Yeah.
[01:20:39.091 --> 01:20:40.312]  Alright, I'll put you on hold.
[01:20:40.332 --> 01:20:41.533]  We'll come right back to you after this quick break.
[01:20:41.573 --> 01:20:42.373]  Long segment coming up.
[01:20:42.734 --> 01:20:44.895]  Tons of time to take your calls and a lot more with George Humphrey.
[01:20:45.255 --> 01:20:48.898]  But yeah, don't let me forget in our extended interview we're gonna do about mind control.
[01:20:48.918 --> 01:20:51.700]  Because this film's gonna talk about how they program people.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.301]  You know, all the different levels of programming.
[01:20:54.321 --> 01:20:54.421]  Yeah.
[01:20:54.762 --> 01:20:55.822]  A left-right paradigm.
[01:20:55.842 --> 01:20:58.144]  You know, all of this that's going on that gets people in the dark.
[01:20:59.144 --> 01:21:00.025]  We're on the march.
[01:21:00.525 --> 01:21:02.106]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:03.067 --> 01:21:05.749]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:09.033 --> 01:21:11.754]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[01:21:11.954 --> 01:21:13.074]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[01:21:13.094 --> 01:21:17.276]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[01:21:17.296 --> 01:21:21.857]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function, or are you simply treating the symptoms?
[01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:32.321]  The Sinuplus Elite Advanced Sinus Irrigation System effectively cleanses your sinuses and upper airways of all fungi, bacteria, and pathogens, and clears your sinuses gently and pleasantly.
[01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:32.921]  We're good to go.
[01:22:02.421 --> 01:22:06.465]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:22:22.947 --> 01:22:29.150]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:29.530 --> 01:22:31.371]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:33.932]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:34.012 --> 01:22:44.957]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:45.589 --> 01:22:46.870]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:48.651]  It's about a one world government.
[01:22:49.111 --> 01:22:55.414]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:56.035 --> 01:23:03.819]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:05.440]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:07.061]  The people strike back.
[01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:10.290]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:12.731]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:23:12.871 --> 01:23:16.872]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:23:17.032 --> 01:23:20.712]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:29.254]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:23:29.354 --> 01:23:32.975]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:23:33.195 --> 01:23:39.016]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:23:44.138 --> 01:23:45.841]  Those on the Alex Jones Show are foolish.
[01:23:46.001 --> 01:23:47.363]  Don't call eFoodsDirect.
[01:23:47.584 --> 01:23:53.314]  For the rest of you, go to eFoodsDirect.com or call 800-409-5633.
[01:23:53.494 --> 01:23:58.242]  You can't possibly know or control what government, corporate America or others will do, but you can
[01:24:20.467 --> 01:24:21.888]  Is it getting better?
[01:24:25.309 --> 01:24:29.650]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:24:30.630 --> 01:24:33.111]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[01:24:33.211 --> 01:24:40.994]  You've got someone to blame You said one love
[01:24:42.851 --> 01:24:44.714]  Alright, we're back live.
[01:24:44.734 --> 01:24:48.719]  I'm going to take calls at the end of the show from Nathan, Brian, Mark, Sean, Shane and others.
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:53.065]  I'll tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible before we do that.
[01:24:53.186 --> 01:24:54.808]  One of them is Home Gain.
[01:24:54.828 --> 01:24:58.072]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, Home Gain.
[01:24:58.633 --> 01:24:59.374]  Thank you.
[01:25:14.946 --> 01:25:15.166]  I think so.
[01:25:36.098 --> 01:25:39.721]  For ten years these folks have been helping home sellers and buyers.
[01:25:40.062 --> 01:25:43.485]  Now is the time to take action with your largest asset.
[01:25:43.825 --> 01:25:46.768]  Find a quality realtor at HomeGain.com.
[01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:53.615]  Visit their link on InfoWars.com and look for Max the Orange Home Gain Gorilla to help you with any real estate needs you might have.
[01:25:53.975 --> 01:25:54.676]  You'll love the site.
[01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:55.456]  It's HomeGain.com.
[01:25:57.378 --> 01:26:01.260]  Another one of our fine sponsors is survivalseedbank.com.
[01:26:01.301 --> 01:26:08.105]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:26:08.465 --> 01:26:14.429]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims for example, when seeds have the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[01:26:14.949 --> 01:26:22.099]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite as they buy them up and put them in these huge seed vaults, and the UN is involved with that as well.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:28.949]  So Solutions from Science is trying to get the seeds out of the globalist's hands and into the hands of the people, one seed bank at a time, one family at a time.
[01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:31.373]  Survival Seed Bank from Solutions from Science.
[01:26:31.733 --> 01:26:35.715]  Contains enough open pollinated seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:26:35.755 --> 01:26:37.496]  Getting independent is the way to go.
[01:26:37.516 --> 01:26:38.497]  Plus gardening is just great.
[01:26:38.777 --> 01:26:44.259]  Survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.601]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:26:46.861 --> 01:26:48.221]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[01:26:48.682 --> 01:26:52.404]  And lastly, and then straight to your calls, pmemory.net.
[01:26:52.604 --> 01:26:56.806]  You spend all this time listening to the show every day, but how much of the information can you actually recall?
[01:26:58.066 --> 01:27:01.469]  Test yourself right now and try to recall the show aired one week ago.
[01:27:01.489 --> 01:27:04.011]  How about two weeks ago?
[01:27:04.811 --> 01:27:06.853]  And if you cannot recall it, then that's my point.
[01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:11.513]  School of Phenomenal Memory, P Memory, the letter pmemory.net.
[01:27:11.533 --> 01:27:13.854]  Proven results from one lesson, guaranteed.
[01:27:13.914 --> 01:27:16.796]  No gimmicks or magic pills, just pure science and real training that makes sense.
[01:27:17.097 --> 01:27:21.139]  Memorize what you really need to know, such as names, daily information, new languages, and even entire books.
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.981]  Dramatically improve natural memory attention and thinking speed.

[01:27:37.679 --> 01:27:40.081]  Or you can click on the banner at InfoWars.com.
[01:27:40.362 --> 01:27:44.425]  And again, the sponsors are all great, and they also make this radio show possible.
[01:27:45.106 --> 01:27:47.428]  I'll tell you, the time just flies when you're exposing the New World Order.
[01:27:47.708 --> 01:27:48.769]  Let's go back to Nathan.
[01:27:48.849 --> 01:27:56.696]  Okay, your issue with Georgia saying the elite claim they're atheists, they're really Luciferians, they don't want us being on the spiritual side.
[01:27:57.697 --> 01:27:59.799]  But he wasn't saying all atheists are with the New World Order.
[01:27:59.819 --> 01:28:00.200]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:28:01.448 --> 01:28:09.627]  Oh yeah, I mean I agree with that completely, because there's this mindset that atheists don't have morals, and when you really get down to it, morals
[01:28:11.993 --> 01:28:15.934]  Yeah, but who's going to set that health?
[01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:23.657]  Every time a European country votes to say, we don't want to be part of the European Union, they say, no, we're not letting you leave because you don't know, you're not educated, we know best.
[01:28:24.417 --> 01:28:33.440]  So there's this attitude of the elite are saying what their morals are, and if you look at what their morals are, death, destruction, enslavement, with a nice sugar coating.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:40.165]  So, all I'm saying is look at, and people say, well look how Christianity's been used for mass murder, or Islam, or any of this.
[01:28:40.505 --> 01:28:43.707]  That is, again, always these people using that for that.
[01:28:45.089 --> 01:28:46.129]  Yeah, well, but that's the point.
[01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:52.154]  It's that morality is outside of religion as far as I'm concerned.
[01:28:52.174 --> 01:28:57.298]  But, you know, even if you don't consider it to be outside of religion, the main thing is, it's not really hard to find.
[01:28:57.318 --> 01:29:00.400]  You don't have to tell your kid, you know, don't stick dirt in your mouth.
[01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:02.600]  You know, that's part of morality, too.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:04.421]  It's not very complicated in a way.
[01:29:04.441 --> 01:29:07.462]  Either it's helping people or it's not helping people.
[01:29:07.722 --> 01:29:13.565]  Yeah, but I mean, sir, there's all these other dimensions the mathematics experts, the mathematicians have proven.
[01:29:14.005 --> 01:29:17.627]  There's this very narrow spectrum that we live in.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:26.761]  I mean, just to say that, you know, I don't believe there's any higher power or anything greater.
[01:29:26.781 --> 01:29:40.785]  I mean, if you've studied where the Earth is, how it's positioned, you know, its moon is just the right size, and all these other mathematical... and they say, well, that's just because we're alive here because we're the one spot in the universe where this, you know, one out of fifty trillion actually happened.
[01:29:40.805 --> 01:29:43.626]  I mean, the numbers are greater than that.
[01:29:43.726 --> 01:29:44.426]  All I'm saying is,
[01:29:45.126 --> 01:29:47.867]  Look, you could be an atheist all day long or an agnostic.
[01:29:48.367 --> 01:29:52.308]  And I don't blame people looking at mainline churches and, you know, becoming atheists because they're so evil.
[01:29:53.168 --> 01:30:04.791]  But the larger issue here is the elites really do believe in spiritual systems and they are always attempting to get people to not look at that or to go into kind of the mainline paradigms.
[01:30:04.831 --> 01:30:05.551]  George, you want to talk about it?
[01:30:07.572 --> 01:30:10.053]  I completely agree with you, and there's two points.
[01:30:10.433 --> 01:30:30.317]  First of all, listener, I think the most important thing, as a patriot, you agree that all people in this country have the right to their own beliefs, whether they believe in God, whether they say they're a Christian, or a Jew, or a Buddhist, or an Atheist, and that in a republic, we should allow that, and we should be able to work together, and I think you and I are together on that.
[01:30:30.377 --> 01:30:30.937]  Is that correct?
[01:30:32.377 --> 01:30:37.018]  I'm not together with you on it, but you know, the gold standard, that seems to have a religious
[01:30:37.751 --> 01:30:40.112]  You know, pseudo kind of thing behind it.
[01:30:40.212 --> 01:30:52.315]  And when you look at it, it's, you know, if a guy shows up in town with a silver dollar and the silver dollar makes it all the way back to the guy, it doesn't really matter whether it was a silver dollar or, you know, seashells or whatever.
[01:30:52.335 --> 01:30:55.375]  Yeah, but see, a seashell doesn't have a real inherent value.
[01:30:55.835 --> 01:31:01.637]  Silver and gold has always, you know, has a value for industrial means and many other things.
[01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:09.555]  Alex, even on our air show, when you were on there, when you were the Money Masters guy, you said that you weren't necessarily down for the, you know, silver or gold deck.
[01:31:09.575 --> 01:31:09.975]  No, no, no.
[01:31:10.035 --> 01:31:10.836]  I'm not saying that.
[01:31:10.856 --> 01:31:14.138]  I'm saying we could have a fiat system, and I'm open for debate on that.
[01:31:14.178 --> 01:31:17.920]  I'm just saying, to say that gold and silver don't have an inherent value, they do.
[01:31:19.001 --> 01:31:20.262]  I'm not saying that either.
[01:31:20.322 --> 01:31:21.783]  I think they have a good long-term value.
[01:31:21.803 --> 01:31:24.284]  Let me just stop you because we made a mistake during the break and quit taping.
[01:31:24.505 --> 01:31:25.625]  We're taping in there, aren't we?
[01:31:26.246 --> 01:31:27.246]  We're taping on that deck.
[01:31:27.867 --> 01:31:29.188]  Then it's not a crisis, don't worry about it.
[01:31:29.968 --> 01:31:30.889]  Okay, sorry sir, go ahead.
[01:31:31.957 --> 01:31:39.837]  They have a long-term value, and I think any system that has a financial system in it, that you should have gold and silver for long-term, but I think also...
[01:31:41.184 --> 01:31:45.066]  It makes sense to have... I gotta move on.
[01:31:45.927 --> 01:31:50.770]  So much of what happens is we end up arguing with each other over these side issues.
[01:31:51.230 --> 01:31:54.932]  And I'm not saying gay marriage isn't a side issue or abortion isn't a side issue.
[01:31:56.053 --> 01:31:57.454]  I'm saying for the elite they are.
[01:31:57.874 --> 01:32:01.416]  They want us fighting all day over all these issues that
[01:32:03.635 --> 01:32:08.882]  Aren't in the overall plan of, we have a tyrannical world government run by a bunch of murdering eugenicists.
[01:32:09.623 --> 01:32:16.451]  And you know, all these people I've talked to, oh the bankers are corrupt, I agree things are getting bad, but Obama's gonna fix it when he's bought and paid for by them, George!
[01:32:17.039 --> 01:32:22.447]  Well, there's no question is that Obama is a perfect Trojan horse for these people.
[01:32:22.927 --> 01:32:27.413]  He is the most charismatic, he's the most articulate, he's just awesome.
[01:32:27.433 --> 01:32:30.938]  He was the perfect pick by the Illuminati to carry their water.
[01:32:31.559 --> 01:32:33.962]  And that just makes the game a lot more interesting.
[01:32:34.463 --> 01:32:40.288]  And it makes a lot more dangerous, because if Brother McCain had gotten elected, it would have been easy to pick him apart.
[01:32:40.809 --> 01:32:42.030]  And I agree with Alex.
[01:32:42.450 --> 01:32:54.561]  At this time, we need to set our priorities, and we need to stay focused, and we need to keep on track of what's really important, because survival is what it's all about right now.
[01:32:55.482 --> 01:32:55.862]  Absolutely.
[01:32:55.882 --> 01:32:56.703]  Let's take another call.
[01:32:56.743 --> 01:32:57.743]  Brian in Colorado.
[01:32:57.764 --> 01:32:58.544]  I've got to hurry through these.
[01:32:58.584 --> 01:32:59.205]  We'll never get to them all.
[01:32:59.505 --> 01:33:00.206]  Brian, go ahead.
[01:33:01.431 --> 01:33:08.314]  Hey Alex, long time listener since 2002, also Prison Planet member, TV member.
[01:33:08.334 --> 01:33:09.094]  Thank you.
[01:33:09.114 --> 01:33:18.538]  Hey, I've got a theory here, and I think it's credible, and if you give me a minute to connect the dots and put out all the dots out there.
[01:33:19.198 --> 01:33:28.961]  Now, you've talked about the 80% of the world population reduction, what they want to do.
[01:33:30.678 --> 01:33:38.582]  And I believe, personally, that if this is what they're going to try to do, they're going to do it through an airborne virus type thing.
[01:33:39.703 --> 01:33:48.047]  Now, what if 20% of the population was resistant to that airborne virus?
[01:33:49.908 --> 01:33:58.893]  You've had a doctor on your show that she stated that these airborne viruses are fairly vulnerable and they're short-lived in the air.
[01:34:00.259 --> 01:34:01.940]  Now, this is where I'm getting into my theory.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:13.064]  What if those airborne viruses were to enter into the body into a toxic environment, such as a smoker's lung?
[01:34:14.285 --> 01:34:26.210]  Now, nicotine has been used as a pesticide for many years, and there's been this war against smokers.
[01:34:26.890 --> 01:34:28.691]  I mean, we got this new tax, and they're trying to...
[01:34:29.824 --> 01:34:32.446]  They're trying to get us to quit smoking for whatever reason.
[01:34:33.007 --> 01:34:35.429]  So, do you see where I'm going with this?
[01:34:35.549 --> 01:34:37.231]  Oh yeah, cigarettes are a magic elixir.
[01:34:37.651 --> 01:34:38.412]  I don't agree with you.
[01:34:39.393 --> 01:34:50.083]  Certainly, look, look, look, the establishment is going to carry out controlled bio-attacks that are smaller to lock us down and train us that they're our saviors and are going to protect us from the next bio-attack.
[01:34:50.103 --> 01:34:51.564]  Well, they're already doing it right now.
[01:34:51.624 --> 01:34:54.367]  All you have to do is look up in the air and look at the chemtrails.
[01:34:54.827 --> 01:34:58.492]  I mean, I was just out in California two weeks ago and I was outside.
[01:34:58.532 --> 01:35:01.736]  The weather is exactly the same every single day.
[01:35:02.036 --> 01:35:03.318]  Day one, totally clear.
[01:35:03.338 --> 01:35:04.580]  Day two, totally clear.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:05.601]  Day three, totally clear.
[01:35:05.901 --> 01:35:09.686]  Day four, the planes are spraying all over.
[01:35:10.407 --> 01:35:11.428]  Uh, all over.
[01:35:11.769 --> 01:35:15.252]  And I get, I look at the people, look up, look up, look up.
[01:35:15.372 --> 01:35:16.954]  The next day, clear, clear, clear.
[01:35:17.895 --> 01:35:21.479]  The fourth day, the next fourth day, it's all tic-tac-toe.
[01:35:21.719 --> 01:35:22.600]  And you can see it.
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:27.405]  And it's at like 5,000 feet on a hot day, and it's not ice crystals, it doesn't dissipate.
[01:35:27.865 --> 01:35:31.369]  And then there's all these universities now admitting they're doing weather modifications.
[01:35:31.849 --> 01:35:40.638]  Sir, they want to go after smoking because they want to put taxes on it and control it, and it sounds good to have socialism to take our rights for a good issue, a good cause.
[01:35:41.679 --> 01:35:43.220]  They're going to hit us with cocktails of things.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.143]  Sodium fluoride in the water, cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:35:46.163 --> 01:35:49.006]  They're hitting us at a lot of different levels, but I appreciate your call, Brian.
[01:35:50.187 --> 01:35:51.669]  And no question is a bad question.
[01:35:52.529 --> 01:35:56.930]  I just don't think smoking is protecting us, so they don't want us smoking because they're going to do that.
[01:35:58.090 --> 01:36:01.891]  A lot of studies show you actually get more airborne things in your lungs when you do smoke because it breaks them down.
[01:36:02.511 --> 01:36:03.931]  Let's talk to Mark in Oregon.
[01:36:03.951 --> 01:36:04.732]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:36:04.752 --> 01:36:06.772]  Hello, George and Alex.
[01:36:06.792 --> 01:36:07.852]  Great to speak with you.
[01:36:08.752 --> 01:36:15.174]  George, thank you also for your great heart and your great articulation of the important issues through the years.
[01:36:16.334 --> 01:36:20.975]  George, as Alex has so recently well documented,
[01:36:21.826 --> 01:36:24.827]  We have mass graves being dug for us around the country.
[01:36:25.827 --> 01:36:34.830]  And there are millions of plastic coffins being delivered to FEMA storage areas, which have been ordered by the Centers for Disease Control.
[01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:41.412]  And the federal government has prepared enough bird flu vaccinations ready and waiting to use on all of us.
[01:36:42.752 --> 01:36:49.814]  George, in your view, how do these activities by the federal government fit into their overall plans for the American people?
[01:36:51.075 --> 01:37:02.142]  And what do you see as the time when they will use their biological warfare on us all relative to their overall agenda of this country's total destruction?
[01:37:03.202 --> 01:37:05.384]  Well, first of all, thank you for your kind words.
[01:37:07.315 --> 01:37:30.521]  Boy, nobody knows the exact dates, but we do know that the federal government, which is not really our government, this is not a government, it is a corporation controlled by the Federal Reserve, has already been poisoning us intentionally through the vaccines, through the chemtrails, through the fluoride in our water, through the misinformation, and on and on and on and on, to weaken the people.
[01:37:30.581 --> 01:37:31.861]  And as Thomas Paine said,
[01:37:32.679 --> 01:37:38.762]  The beacon of freedom in the United States can be the beacon of freedom for the whole world, and the Illuminati do not want this.
[01:37:39.383 --> 01:37:41.564]  And so they are smart enough.
[01:37:42.384 --> 01:37:44.605]  Now the neocons were really pushing the schedule.
[01:37:47.122 --> 01:37:50.765]  I don't know how fast they're going to go because they're going with the financial implosion.
[01:37:50.785 --> 01:37:52.726]  They're going with the financial crisis.
[01:37:52.866 --> 01:38:03.273]  You know, in this situation, we are going to have massive, massive debt deflation for a much longer period of time than what we're being told.
[01:38:03.653 --> 01:38:14.620]  Because there is no way in the world that even if they issue twenty or twenty-five trillion dollars of this bailout money, can they sop up all of this debt derivative debt.
[01:38:15.501 --> 01:38:16.442]  And that's just a fact.
[01:38:16.562 --> 01:38:21.345]  And they're just putting plasma into a dead man right now, trying to get this thing going.
[01:38:21.725 --> 01:38:28.589]  Unless they get the toxic elements out of the system, the economy cannot recover.
[01:38:28.670 --> 01:38:29.490]  That's just a fact.
[01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:35.134]  Now, when the real Shinola is going to hit the fan, it's hard to tell.
[01:38:35.194 --> 01:38:44.900]  But right now, today, as we speak, the G20 countries are meeting and they're planning on a world currency, a world bank, and world government.
[01:38:46.866 --> 01:38:49.267]  And this is not theory, as you know.
[01:38:49.327 --> 01:38:52.307]  I mean, it sounds like you've really, really done your homework.
[01:38:53.107 --> 01:38:55.928]  And the question is, is that we know that it's coming.
[01:38:55.988 --> 01:38:59.149]  All you have to do is extend the lines of what's there.
[01:38:59.589 --> 01:39:05.850]  The question is, is what can you and I and Alex and the others do to derail this train?
[01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:13.491]  Because we believe in something better for our families, better for our grandchildren and our children, but also for ourselves.
[01:39:14.012 --> 01:39:15.452]  And I guarantee you,
[01:39:16.172 --> 01:39:16.512]  Absolutely.
[01:39:16.532 --> 01:39:16.932]  Absolutely.
[01:39:35.223 --> 01:39:56.139]  Well, the mind control is just so amazing and there is a psychological term called cognitive dissonance and it is a very, very real psychological thing that when a person invest their time, energy or money into a concept and then they see it's wrong is that physically they have a very difficult time of changing courses.
[01:39:56.419 --> 01:40:04.526]  It's just like in the movie The Matrix when Neo goes into the construct and he realizes this is all an illusion and that this is all just
[01:40:05.799 --> 01:40:09.583]  You know, it's not what it appears, and he comes out, he gets physically sick.
[01:40:10.144 --> 01:40:15.210]  And I remember when I first became aware of the New World Order, I became physically ill.
[01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:17.673]  It was that big of a shock to my system.
[01:40:18.274 --> 01:40:24.361]  And as Winston Churchill said, almost every man at some time in their life is knocked down by the truth.
[01:40:25.361 --> 01:40:30.385]  99% of them get up, dust themselves off, and walk away like nothing has happened.
[01:40:30.405 --> 01:40:33.827]  1% will really figure out what's going and do something about it.
[01:40:34.167 --> 01:40:40.731]  And it sounds like, my friend, that you are aware of what's going on, and you and your friends are doing something about it.
[01:40:41.071 --> 01:40:48.236]  And it's going to take the combined work of the people all over this country, all over this world, to say no to this insanity.
[01:40:48.599 --> 01:40:49.759]  Absolutely, okay.
[01:40:50.279 --> 01:40:52.280]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:53.680]  Sean, we've got to hurry here.
[01:40:54.201 --> 01:40:55.501]  Sean in Minnesota, go ahead.
[01:40:57.121 --> 01:41:00.582]  Hey there, good day to you Alex and George.
[01:41:02.023 --> 01:41:14.726]  You guys made a profound remark about how under the globalist system of thought they believe that they are obligated to warn the public and
[01:41:15.265 --> 01:41:23.011]  And I want to ask both of you guys, have you seen this comic series that's been published in the London Telegraph called Blackjack?
[01:41:23.452 --> 01:41:42.888]  Yeah, Steve Watson's written a three-part series on Blackjack, where the New World Order stages all the terror attacks, nukes going off to bring in world government, and they won't say where it came from, just a major paper just publishes this in a way of letting you know, we're going to set off nukes, we're the government, and the government's going to stage the attacks.
[01:41:44.614 --> 01:41:46.015]  Absolutely true.
[01:41:46.655 --> 01:41:52.779]  I find it very strange that the paper does not disclose the name of the author.
[01:41:52.879 --> 01:41:53.919]  And they do on all the other times.
[01:41:54.179 --> 01:41:58.422]  Guys, pull up Blackjack during the break after we show some of the visual ads for the sponsors.
[01:41:59.362 --> 01:42:01.884]  We'll come out with Blackjack, the comic.
[01:42:02.444 --> 01:42:04.325]  It's not a comic, it's just a visual thing.
[01:42:04.885 --> 01:42:05.746]  Martial Law, too.
[01:42:05.766 --> 01:42:07.387]  They show you Martial Law going to FEMA camps.
[01:42:09.227 --> 01:42:12.510]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:16.753]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:42:16.933 --> 01:42:24.900]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:25.600]  We're good to go!
[01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:56.060]  We're good to go.
[01:43:15.778 --> 01:43:21.120]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:27.843]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:43:28.163 --> 01:43:29.964]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:43:30.124 --> 01:43:32.505]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:43:32.585 --> 01:43:43.469]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:43:45.763 --> 01:43:47.023]  It's not about left or right.
[01:43:47.423 --> 01:43:48.824]  It's about a one world government.
[01:43:49.284 --> 01:43:55.606]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:44:04.448 --> 01:44:05.608]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:06.029 --> 01:44:07.209]  The people strike back.
[01:44:08.715 --> 01:44:12.579]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[01:44:12.919 --> 01:44:16.222]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?
[01:44:16.563 --> 01:44:19.946]  Have you been looking for a safe, natural alternative to help ease your pain?
[01:44:20.386 --> 01:44:23.289]  If so, you need to visit solartherm.ca.
[01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:31.217]  SolarTherm, the pain care you wear, is a patented ceramic fiber support technology that holds in and reflects your own body heat.
[01:44:31.237 --> 01:44:31.357]  Yeah!
[01:44:50.686 --> 01:44:54.307]  Way up north to Alaska Way up north to Alaska North to Alaska Go north for us, you're so
[01:45:21.131 --> 01:45:38.007]  All right, let's try to get in as many callers as we can right now.
[01:45:38.027 --> 01:45:40.650]  Let's talk to Shane in Denver.
[01:45:40.830 --> 01:45:41.631]  Shane, you're on the air.
[01:45:41.671 --> 01:45:42.251]  Go ahead.
[01:45:43.132 --> 01:45:43.412]  Hello, Alex.
[01:45:43.733 --> 01:45:44.934]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:45:46.065 --> 01:45:49.248]  I'd like to cover real quick, Stanley Meyer's HHL Energy.
[01:45:50.208 --> 01:45:52.190]  We can convert these cars to run off water.
[01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:56.773]  We're using stainless steel and mason jars.
[01:45:58.515 --> 01:46:01.657]  And this has been in application since the early 70s.
[01:46:01.737 --> 01:46:06.080]  There's actually a video of surfing... No, I've seen it, but do you have any comments or questions for George Humphrey?
[01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:10.424]  Actually, my main concern with the G20 Summit is
[01:46:11.468 --> 01:46:17.851]  Uh, and they're, they're producing, mass producing, uh, terminator seeds and providing them to third world countries in Africa.
[01:46:18.711 --> 01:46:20.592]  And it's going to cause a mass starvation.
[01:46:20.832 --> 01:46:23.753]  On your video with the Obama deception, I know it's on Rockefeller's car.
[01:46:23.793 --> 01:46:24.934]  He was talking about ethanol.
[01:46:25.154 --> 01:46:27.675]  That's going to cause mass starvation throughout the United States as well.
[01:46:27.715 --> 01:46:28.776]  It's not an alternative.
[01:46:28.796 --> 01:46:29.476]  It's horrible.
[01:46:30.157 --> 01:46:32.259]  You have to harvest the organs of the plant.
[01:46:32.319 --> 01:46:33.580]  This caller is real low.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.001]  Can you guys boost him up for me?
[01:46:35.041 --> 01:46:37.883]  Maybe he's fine on air, but I'm having trouble hearing him.
[01:46:37.923 --> 01:46:38.444]  Interesting, sir.
[01:46:38.464 --> 01:46:40.285]  I don't mean to cut you off, but I have a caller who disagrees.
[01:46:40.305 --> 01:46:41.226]  They go to the head of the line.
[01:46:41.667 --> 01:46:42.747]  Mark in Colorado.
[01:46:42.767 --> 01:46:43.328]  You're on the air.
[01:46:43.388 --> 01:46:43.828]  Go ahead.
[01:46:44.549 --> 01:46:45.089]  Hey, Alex.
[01:46:45.149 --> 01:46:47.251]  I think you and George are doing a wonderful job.
[01:46:47.311 --> 01:46:49.153]  I think you have a huge hole in your intellect.
[01:46:49.193 --> 01:46:54.097]  You compromise way too much with people who claim to be atheists, gnostics, and agnostics.
[01:46:54.157 --> 01:46:58.380]  Both of you need to buy and read a book called The Answers Book 2 from answersingenesis.org.
[01:46:59.648 --> 01:47:00.808]  And quit the compromising.
[01:47:01.169 --> 01:47:03.149]  God bless you for your work, and I'm hanging up.
[01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:15.193]  Alright, look, we're not compromising, but I always have a group call me up and say, you gotta bash Jews, or you gotta bash Catholics, you gotta bash Blacks, you gotta bash Hindus, you gotta bash this.
[01:47:15.853 --> 01:47:18.514]  I got a news show, and I'm here doing a news show.
[01:47:18.574 --> 01:47:22.516]  It's not one of these little specialty shows where people just cover one thing all day.
[01:47:24.156 --> 01:47:42.299]  I'm here covering world government being set up, and cancer viruses in the vaccines, and chemtrails spraying, and giant FEMA camps being built, admittedly with plastic coffins, and people in denial, and a guy called up saying that we were saying that all atheists were running the New World Order.
[01:47:42.339 --> 01:47:45.380]  We said, no, we're saying the elitist claim they're atheist.
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:52.101]  So, I mean, you know, there's so much intellectual dishonesty out there, or simplicity, it's like
[01:47:53.086 --> 01:47:59.429]  People always email me and they say, you have a sponsor selling tasers, but you say it's wrong when the police taser people.
[01:47:59.509 --> 01:48:03.091]  No, I'm saying it's wrong when a pregnant lady doesn't move quick enough and they taser.
[01:48:03.291 --> 01:48:07.233]  Or the guys on the ground going, don't taser me bro, it's the misuse of it.
[01:48:07.273 --> 01:48:12.016]  It's like people that are anti-gun say, we gotta ban all guns because people get killed with them.
[01:48:12.076 --> 01:48:13.797]  No, it's the misuse of the gun.
[01:48:14.744 --> 01:48:16.525]  I mean, I'm not against police having guns.
[01:48:16.565 --> 01:48:17.565]  I don't want to miss using them.
[01:48:17.806 --> 01:48:19.366]  I'm not against citizens having guns.
[01:48:19.406 --> 01:48:20.347]  I don't want to miss using them.
[01:48:20.947 --> 01:48:23.788]  That's the whole issue, and so I get that.
[01:48:23.828 --> 01:48:37.575]  It's like, there's no psychological differential to, you know, because the other guy thought we were saying he was part of the New World Order, and the other guy thought we were endorsing atheism, George.
[01:48:37.595 --> 01:48:38.756]  I mean, you can't win.
[01:48:41.903 --> 01:48:42.503]  Sometimes.
[01:48:43.063 --> 01:48:50.125]  And the point is, is that if we do live in a truly free constitutional republic, we have to allow different points of view.
[01:48:51.006 --> 01:48:53.246]  And that's just the way it is.
[01:48:53.366 --> 01:48:54.507]  And that's a great thing.
[01:48:54.567 --> 01:48:57.247]  Having these discussions and these debates are great.
[01:48:57.628 --> 01:49:01.589]  And at the same time, as Alex says, we've got more important fish to fry.
[01:49:01.629 --> 01:49:06.910]  There's a bunch of folks out there who are getting ready to create a world government and try and really stuff us.
[01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:09.171]  And that's where I've got my attention.
[01:49:09.511 --> 01:49:10.392]  Now, we're out of time.
[01:49:11.032 --> 01:49:13.814]  Jason Bermas will be sitting in tomorrow from 11 a.m.
[01:49:13.834 --> 01:49:14.394]  to 3 p.m.
[01:49:14.474 --> 01:49:16.635]  And then he'll be back tomorrow night, 9 to midnight.
[01:49:16.695 --> 01:49:18.857]  He'll be on tonight, The Info Warrior, 9 to midnight.
[01:49:19.297 --> 01:49:21.238]  Be sure and join him for that.
[01:49:21.298 --> 01:49:22.659]  Please tell folks about Jason's show.
[01:49:22.719 --> 01:49:23.519]  It's getting really popular.
[01:49:23.539 --> 01:49:25.140]  There are quite a few stations picking it up.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:28.222]  If stations are listening, pick up my show, pick up The Info Warrior.
[01:49:28.242 --> 01:49:32.525]  Check it out, 9 to midnight central at GCN, up there on the Star Guide satellite.
[01:49:32.545 --> 01:49:35.827]  Details at TheInfoWarrior or InfoWarrior.com.
[01:49:36.107 --> 01:49:37.568]  George Humphrey, I want to thank you for coming in, brother.
[01:49:37.808 --> 01:49:43.252]  Alex, it's so great to be here, and I'll tell you, all your friends, go and get the Obama deception right now.
[01:49:43.453 --> 01:49:44.273]  I really am proud of it.
[01:49:44.293 --> 01:49:45.874]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:46.135 --> 01:49:46.815]  God bless you all.
[01:49:50.458 --> 01:49:53.741]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:49:53.781 --> 01:49:55.782]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:49:58.749 --> 01:50:00.330]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:05.053]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:05.173 --> 01:50:07.935]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:08.136 --> 01:50:10.998]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:50:11.178 --> 01:50:15.901]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:50:16.041 --> 01:50:16.421]  We're good to go.
[01:50:35.908 --> 01:50:37.129]  Thank you for listening to GCTV.
[01:51:05.347 --> 01:51:05.841]  We're good.
