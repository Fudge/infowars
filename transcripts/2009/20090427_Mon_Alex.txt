[00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.140]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.901]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:09.663]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:11.245]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:12.807]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:16.991]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:21.056]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:27.471]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:30.256]  It is Monday, the 27th day of April 2009.
[00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:34.562]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:36.372 --> 00:00:56.482]  One name popped into my mind over the weekend as the bird-slash-swine-slash-human-flu-pandemic-of-fear swept the planet, and that was Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, who is a medical doctor and expert on the bird flu and runs a high-end clinic in Mexico, in between her clinic in the United States.
[00:00:57.242 --> 00:01:01.743]  We've been unable to get through to her this weekend on phone numbers to her clinics in Mexico.
[00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:06.904]  The phone systems are having major troubles across Mexico City.
[00:01:06.904 --> 00:01:17.686]  I've been getting a lot of emails from people in Mexico that have tried to call the special Saturday 2 hour 40 minute transmission I did and the Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:22.447]  the regularly scheduled Sunday edition I do and they've been unable to call.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.282]  We're going to open the phones up for eyewitness reports from inside Mexico.
[00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:35.205]  We first got eyewitness reports Saturday night that there were more people dead and sick than the media was saying.
[00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:38.566]  That's now been confirmed as of today.
[00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:48.290]  And so the intel we're getting has also been matched by a BBC report that the deaths are far greater than what is being reported.
[00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.652]  So I'm going to open the phones up for folks inside Mexico.
[00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:52.922]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:52.922 --> 00:01:54.143]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:54.143 --> 00:02:03.650]  I'm also going to open up our phone system.
[00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.192]  So let's get that number on screen.
[00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:17.461]  And I still don't have our local studio number memorized because I want to give people a 512 local number because in Mexico sometimes people can't call 1-800 numbers from outside the country.
[00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:18.422]  So we will
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.581]  Give you, if you're in Mexico with Eyewitness Reports, a 512 local number.
[00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.282]  So give your country access code and 512-646-1776.
[00:02:25.282 --> 00:02:25.402]  512-646-1776.
[00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:26.422]  You can also try 888-201-2244.
[00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:26.482]  888-201-2244.
[00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:30.384]  We'll open those phone systems right now for people that want to call in.
[00:02:51.164 --> 00:02:54.687]  All right, that said, again the number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:55.107]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:55.107 --> 00:03:15.524]  We're going to have a lot of open phones today, so listeners can bring up different angles, different pieces of evidence, different news pieces that they think are important as we analyze what's going on with this unfolding crisis.
[00:03:17.813 --> 00:03:19.213]  So here are the numbers one more time.
[00:03:19.213 --> 00:03:46.341]  1-800-259-9231 512-646-1776 888-201-2244 I would ask though in this first round of calls that only people with family in Mexico or people in Mexico with eyewitness reports or second-hand reports from family members or co-workers in Mexico of just how bad this really is.
[00:03:48.772 --> 00:03:53.533]  And then, later in this hour, we'll open the phones up for everybody.
[00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.254]  I want to make that clear.
[00:03:55.254 --> 00:04:02.916]  Because I want to give people a chance, on the phone systems, the three numbers we just gave out for people to be able to get on.
[00:04:02.916 --> 00:04:16.180]  It's good to have a show this large, with listeners listening to shortwave and internet all over the world, and a huge AM and FM audience here in the United States, to be able to, on every show, get calls from across North America.
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.100]  The virus
[00:04:19.827 --> 00:04:21.307]  It is in Canada.
[00:04:21.307 --> 00:04:22.888]  It is in Spain.
[00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:25.088]  It is in Israel.
[00:04:25.088 --> 00:04:26.249]  It is in Texas.
[00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.009]  It is in California.
[00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.730]  It is now popping up in New York and other areas.
[00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:38.612]  Now, that said, when we come back, is this a pandemic danger?
[00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.413]  Is this a real threat?
[00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:41.513]  Or is it hype?
[00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:43.033]  A shy-off?
[00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:48.495]  I have all the news and information, literally hundreds of articles, documents, the back story on this.
[00:04:49.682 --> 00:04:58.095]  And what I think is going on when we get back then, Steve Quayle, who warned of this last Monday before anybody was talking about it, he'll be with us coming up.
[00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:00.037]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, we get her in Mexico.
[00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:02.275]  So you want to stop smoking?
[00:05:02.275 --> 00:05:03.556]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:06.439]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.422]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[00:05:10.422 --> 00:05:14.185]  And if and only if you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it?
[00:05:14.185 --> 00:05:16.207]  Most likely, if you tried this, you'd be arrested.
[00:05:16.207 --> 00:05:20.090]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the smoke-free free trial offer is.
[00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.576]  Smoke Free is a complete all-natural stop smoking system and when you call today they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program absolutely free.
[00:05:27.576 --> 00:05:35.602]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings and includes a 30-day supply of the Smoke Free Capsules, a guide to living smoke-free book, and audio support program.
[00:05:35.922 --> 00:05:37.263]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:06:04.284 --> 00:06:06.339]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:13.016]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.016 --> 00:06:19.498]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.498 --> 00:06:21.479]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.939]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:34.823]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.142 --> 00:06:38.804]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.804 --> 00:06:40.666]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:47.573]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:55.842 --> 00:06:57.423]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.423 --> 00:06:58.605]  The people strike back.
[00:07:01.215 --> 00:07:03.118]  You are a rebel, admit it.
[00:07:03.118 --> 00:07:06.082]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[00:07:06.082 --> 00:07:08.486]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:12.411]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:16.237]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot, and you can count your real friends on one
[00:07:18.507 --> 00:07:24.112]  Edison failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[00:07:24.112 --> 00:07:28.776]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the light bulb.
[00:07:28.776 --> 00:07:33.539]  George Washington rebelled against an entire country, and led the creation of a new one.
[00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:36.762]  Now, Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[00:07:36.762 --> 00:07:38.323]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:41.146]  Put in a food supply from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:41.146 --> 00:07:44.048]  Everyone will realize you were not a nutcase after all.
[00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:50.497]  Be sure you have enough food to keep on standing.
[00:07:50.497 --> 00:07:51.378]  800-409-5633. efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:51.378 --> 00:07:51.638]  That's 800-409-5633.
[00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:52.019]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.454 --> 00:08:08.216]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:09.998]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.998 --> 00:08:11.560]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.121]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:17.326]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.326 --> 00:08:21.430]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.292 --> 00:08:42.635]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is going to be joining us here on air in about seven minutes for the balance of this first hour.
[00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:48.919]  A medical doctor who has a practice in the United States and in Mexico itself.
[00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:50.520]  Expert on the bird flu.
[00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:56.284]  She will be joining us coming up in about six, seven minutes.
[00:08:56.284 --> 00:08:59.165]  Then in the last hour today, Steve Quayle.
[00:08:59.165 --> 00:09:08.551]  Steve Quayle came on the show last Monday and said his intel was that the establishment was planning to go with a bio-attack, some type of bird flu.
[00:09:10.563 --> 00:09:13.966]  And so we've got him coming back on today in the last hour.
[00:09:13.966 --> 00:09:19.491]  2 o'clock Central Standard Time or 2 hours 50 minutes from now.
[00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:20.913]  51 minutes to be precise.
[00:09:20.913 --> 00:09:21.994]  Steve Quayle will be joining us.
[00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:24.136]  We're going to have open phones today.
[00:09:24.136 --> 00:09:27.058]  I want to let listeners know that
[00:09:29.864 --> 00:09:45.608]  If you're in Mexico, or you have family in Mexico, or you're in South Texas where they've shut down a lot of the schools, Saturday night I did a two plus hour emergency transmission, and we got calls from one of the towns north of San Antonio where they locked down one of the schools and are closing it.
[00:09:45.608 --> 00:09:52.770]  We got calls from Mexico City with a lot of key eyewitness reports about how 70% or more of the people they saw were sick.
[00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.353]  That the deaths were a lot higher than what the media was saying.
[00:09:56.353 --> 00:10:03.081]  Then the BBC had reports from doctors and hospitals saying it was more than 200 deaths as of Saturday.
[00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:05.924]  They were still saying 68 deaths as of yesterday.
[00:10:05.924 --> 00:10:06.705]  Now they're saying 103 confirmed.
[00:10:11.032 --> 00:10:28.607]  The total free number to join us if you're in Mexico, or in Canada, or in any area, know someone who's gotten sick, or if you've seen anything going on, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, because you can't trust the mainstream media.
[00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:30.229]  We can analyze what they're saying and doing.
[00:10:32.677 --> 00:10:36.180]  But you can't just take it as is.
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.862]  You've got to check it with a lot of other sources and things.
[00:10:38.862 --> 00:10:41.344]  Now, let me just make this clear.
[00:10:41.344 --> 00:10:44.426]  I think this is a bunch of hype.
[00:10:44.426 --> 00:11:00.979]  But when you've got the World Health Organization saying they fear a massive global pandemic, and have the military standing by in the Western world for martial law, and that's what this medical emergency is, the executive orders have been put into place, continuity of government has been engaged, that's what the executive orders say,
[00:11:02.025 --> 00:11:08.271]  That's what they announced Sunday morning with a rare White House Sunday briefing.
[00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:10.853]  So they create the fear and then say, oh, but it's no big deal.
[00:11:10.853 --> 00:11:16.819]  So they can be both the person scaring you and the person playing the part of then being your protector.
[00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:20.862]  I think it's a bunch of hype, unless they're lying about the severity of it.
[00:11:20.862 --> 00:11:26.788]  The way they're hyping it and saying it's, you know, they're getting ready for this big crisis, but then, oh, it's no big deal at the same time.
[00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:38.710]  If they are lying about the number of cases, they're just saying a few thousand in Mexico, when they're talking... and then other reports out of Mexico say there's just people sick everywhere.
[00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.654]  A country of 100 million people, and then they're saying that it's only 2,000 people sick and 100 people dying.
[00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.212]  Because the flu in the United States on average kills 15,000 people.
[00:11:51.212 --> 00:11:57.955]  And it kills even more than that each year in Mexico because of bad sanitation, lack of medical care, and people's access to it because they're so poor.
[00:11:57.955 --> 00:12:00.095]  One of the poorest nations in the world.
[00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:04.137]  But of course they have more billionaires than any nation on the planet.
[00:12:04.137 --> 00:12:04.957]  Because they're so corrupt.
[00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:09.759]  They have a super elite and a huge mass of poor people.
[00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:12.901]  So something doesn't jive here.
[00:12:12.901 --> 00:12:15.502]  Something stinks to high heaven here.
[00:12:16.877 --> 00:12:23.461]  Because, uh, I'm actually hoping that hundreds of thousands are sick in Mexico.
[00:12:23.461 --> 00:12:25.462]  Now listen to me carefully.
[00:12:25.462 --> 00:12:34.967]  Because if hundreds of thousands are sick, and then it's only a hundred and something deaths like they're now saying, then that means it's a regular flu.
[00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:38.709]  Flu always kills people.
[00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:39.009]  Okay?
[00:12:40.543 --> 00:12:50.866]  But if it really is only 2,000 people sick in Mexico, and you got 103 people at least dead, then this is a bad acting flu.
[00:12:50.866 --> 00:12:53.727]  I wouldn't call it weaponized, but it's tough stuff.
[00:12:53.727 --> 00:12:55.867]  It's on the verge of that.
[00:12:55.867 --> 00:13:03.230]  Now, the available evidence shows they're lying, and it's way more than 2,000 cases in Mexico.
[00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.451]  And so, that means, oh good, it's not some super deadly flu.
[00:13:08.911 --> 00:13:15.375]  The reason governments are so concerned is that the swine flu of 1918, released at a U.S.
[00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:24.240]  military base, clearly a designer virus, killed at least, they debate between 40 and 60 million worldwide, at least 40 million people.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:30.303]  Millions in Europe and the United States.
[00:13:30.303 --> 00:13:36.247]  And it attacked healthy people.
[00:13:38.092 --> 00:13:40.753]  It attacked healthy people.
[00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:56.802]  It attacked people between 18 and 30 years of age that were very healthy, very virile, very strong because their autoimmune system in their lungs had an over-response to it, flooding the areas with
[00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.271]  Antibodies with white blood cells causing an autoimmune response.
[00:14:03.271 --> 00:14:11.854]  Their lungs swolled up and they died basically of a quick-acting pneumonia.
[00:14:11.854 --> 00:14:19.616]  And I guess that ties into some type of hemorrhagic fever where you get one bug and then you have an autoimmune response and it kills you.
[00:14:19.616 --> 00:14:24.117]  We'll talk to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny in a moment.
[00:14:24.117 --> 00:14:25.038]  In fact, do we have her yet?
[00:14:25.038 --> 00:14:25.698]  Go ahead and call her.
[00:14:28.322 --> 00:14:35.864]  She's normally in Mexico, but when I'm unable to get her in Mexico, then they told me right as I came in to the next segment that they'd gotten a hold of her, so I'm not even sure where she's at.
[00:14:35.864 --> 00:14:41.546]  We'll find out when we get her.
[00:14:41.546 --> 00:14:50.709]  So understand, the government's response to this is what should raise our eyebrows, raise our ears, raise the hackles on the back of our neck.
[00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:58.571]  Because flu kills 15,000 people, some numbers say 30,000, but the conservative numbers are 15,000 on average in the U.S.
[00:14:58.571 --> 00:15:02.272]  a year, tens of thousands in Mexico a year.
[00:15:02.272 --> 00:15:06.553]  Why then are they hyping 103 deaths?
[00:15:06.553 --> 00:15:12.774]  Why are they saying there's deaths in Mexico but not in the United States?
[00:15:12.774 --> 00:15:18.735]  So if there's only 2,000 cases in Mexico and it has killed 100 plus people, that is a really bad acting flu.
[00:15:18.735 --> 00:15:19.195]  But if it's
[00:15:20.228 --> 00:15:25.111]  More people that are sick, hundreds of thousands and it's only a hundred dead, well then that sounds like a regular flu.
[00:15:25.111 --> 00:15:35.817]  Then you get into the issue of that this thing has got genetics from pigs, birds, and humans from Europe, Asia, and North America.
[00:15:35.817 --> 00:15:42.201]  You've got the government's response in Napolitano and in Reuters saying, U.S.
[00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:44.323]  should prepare for new flu outbreak.
[00:15:44.323 --> 00:15:44.723]  She said,
[00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:53.182]  Even if this fizzles out, this is a quote in a press conference, in the next two weeks, that another one is coming.
[00:15:53.182 --> 00:15:55.604]  And that's all Reuters says.
[00:15:55.604 --> 00:15:58.365]  But very cryptic there.
[00:15:58.365 --> 00:15:59.986]  They have declared an emergency in Mexico.
[00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:02.047]  They have declared an emergency here.
[00:16:02.047 --> 00:16:06.429]  They do have Europe saying, telling their people, don't fly to the U.S.
[00:16:06.429 --> 00:16:07.890]  or Mexico.
[00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:15.274]  They are banning the importation from southern and western states of pork and other products to Europe and Russia, and they're banning products out of Mexico.
[00:16:16.735 --> 00:16:20.098]  So is this a big beta test drill for a lockdown?
[00:16:20.098 --> 00:16:27.083]  We know that under dark winter and other scenarios they've drilled for a massive flu or smallpox outbreak and martial law.
[00:16:27.083 --> 00:16:29.525]  Joining us for the balance of the hour is Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[00:16:29.525 --> 00:16:32.747]  She is a medical doctor from Cleveland, Ohio.
[00:16:32.747 --> 00:16:38.432]  Board certified in emergency medicine and osteopathic manual medicine.
[00:16:41.175 --> 00:16:45.718]  And she has patients in 38 states and 8 countries.
[00:16:45.718 --> 00:16:47.079]  She's an executive director.
[00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:53.963]  You know, it's better for her to just introduce herself to you.
[00:16:53.963 --> 00:17:03.849]  And she's one of the leading experts out there on bird flu and appears on radio and TV across the planet, including mainstream radio and TV.
[00:17:03.849 --> 00:17:07.791]  So, Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, thank you for coming on on short notice.
[00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:09.252]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:17:09.252 --> 00:17:10.113]  Thanks for thinking of me.
[00:17:12.254 --> 00:17:14.595]  We're about to break, but just tell folks about yourself.
[00:17:14.595 --> 00:17:18.856]  You do have a practice in Mexico and what you're actually hearing in Mexico.
[00:17:18.856 --> 00:17:20.437]  Is it worse than they're saying?
[00:17:20.437 --> 00:17:22.017]  Is it better than they're saying?
[00:17:22.017 --> 00:17:22.977]  Is this hype?
[00:17:22.977 --> 00:17:24.258]  What's going on?
[00:17:24.258 --> 00:17:27.399]  Well, I'm currently right now in Monterey, Mexico.
[00:17:27.399 --> 00:17:36.001]  I've been doing consulting in Mexico for about the last seven months and most recently, about a month ago, that consulting assignment ended and I moved back to Cleveland.
[00:17:36.397 --> 00:17:44.162]  But I'm down here, was down here for this week for a conference of the Medical Tourism Association in Monterey.
[00:17:44.162 --> 00:17:45.743]  We arrived yesterday.
[00:17:45.743 --> 00:18:03.896]  We went to the conference this morning and it was, the officials from the Health Care Association, it's called Monterey Health Care City here in Monterey, came into the conference and there was a tour that was supposed to happen this morning of all the local hospitals and they canceled the tour and that's what we thought was happening.
[00:18:04.318 --> 00:18:08.060]  But what they really did was they canceled the entire conference.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:15.223]  And we're in a really nice hotel, an intercontinental hotel here in Monterey, which isn't anywhere close to Mexico City.
[00:18:15.223 --> 00:18:19.485]  There are people that have flown in for this conference from all over South America.
[00:18:19.485 --> 00:18:24.908]  And the officials here promptly told everybody to go change their airfare and to go home.
[00:18:27.156 --> 00:18:27.796]  Amazing.
[00:18:27.796 --> 00:18:31.238]  So is the... Now that was too early to tell.
[00:18:31.238 --> 00:18:36.221]  One of the people in the conference said, now wait a minute, there's nobody really here from Mexico City.
[00:18:36.221 --> 00:18:38.302]  We're in a closed area in this hotel.
[00:18:38.302 --> 00:18:39.403]  We've been here.
[00:18:39.403 --> 00:18:45.747]  I can understand why maybe you don't want people out traipsing into hospitals here locally, but why don't we have the conference?
[00:18:45.747 --> 00:18:47.628]  And they said, nope, we're canceling the whole conference.
[00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:55.392]  And this one gentleman said, I think there's been a moratorium on common sense for this conference.
[00:18:55.392 --> 00:18:55.853]  Amazing.
[00:18:58.004 --> 00:19:00.325]  I want to go to the bird flu itself.
[00:19:00.325 --> 00:19:11.995]  I was just on Coast to Coast with you in the same show back on March 10th, when Baxter was out mixing bird flu with these big vats of other test vaccines.
[00:19:11.995 --> 00:19:24.105]  And then it came out that other companies, unnamed, the one in Telegraph and other publications, were telling homeless people in Europe, Poland, Germany, and other places that it was just a regular flu shot, but paying them to take it.
[00:19:24.105 --> 00:19:25.527]  And it was killing them deader than a hammer.
[00:19:26.027 --> 00:19:28.009]  So there's a lot going on here.
[00:19:28.009 --> 00:19:35.595]  I want to get your medical view on, you know, are they hyping this, or does the government know something?
[00:19:35.595 --> 00:19:40.598]  The government of Mexico, the United States, governments of Europe, that the public doesn't know.
[00:19:40.598 --> 00:19:46.023]  With Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, our guest from Monterrey, Mexico.
[00:19:46.023 --> 00:19:47.764]  We really appreciate her joining us.
[00:19:47.764 --> 00:19:53.428]  Doctor, we'll be right back after this quick break and go straight back to you to get your expert opinion on this and a lot more.
[00:19:54.582 --> 00:19:55.962]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:55.962 --> 00:20:01.203]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.203 --> 00:20:03.184]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:20:03.184 --> 00:20:10.145]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:20:10.145 --> 00:20:18.527]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:20:18.527 --> 00:20:24.248]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:20:24.668 --> 00:20:26.269]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:20:26.269 --> 00:20:28.449]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:20:28.449 --> 00:20:32.991]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:20:32.991 --> 00:20:35.211]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:20:35.211 --> 00:20:43.094]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:20:43.114 --> 00:20:43.394]  We're good.
[00:21:00.578 --> 00:21:02.159]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:02.419]  April 27, 2009.
[00:21:02.419 --> 00:21:03.460]  Gold opened this morning at $9.1290.
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.502]  One ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.3932, $4.6966 for a half ounce, and $2.3483 for the quarter ounce.
[00:21:06.502 --> 00:21:06.962]  That's $9.3932, $4.6966, and $2.3483.
[00:21:17.759 --> 00:21:21.481]  Bailout equals market distortions, increased money supply while productivity is going down.
[00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:25.784]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:30.486]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share, paying fat dividends.
[00:21:30.486 --> 00:21:36.129]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:39.411]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[00:21:39.411 --> 00:21:42.553]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust?
[00:21:42.553 --> 00:21:44.394]  Or is it time to ensure your hard-earned wealth?
[00:21:44.574 --> 00:21:47.876]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.876 --> 00:21:52.658]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems?
[00:21:52.658 --> 00:21:54.579]  Or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:58.041]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:58.041 --> 00:22:07.025]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:13.989]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:22:14.585 --> 00:22:21.169]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:23.150]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.632]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.632 --> 00:22:37.219]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:37.219 --> 00:22:38.900]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.261]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:47.647]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.647 --> 00:22:55.916]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:57.497]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.497 --> 00:22:58.679]  The people strike back.
[00:23:00.484 --> 00:23:04.726]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear this.
[00:23:04.726 --> 00:23:09.649]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief is?
[00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:12.210]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.
[00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:17.753]  The bailout group has settled over $100 million in credit card debt for people just like you.
[00:23:17.753 --> 00:23:26.558]  The bailout group can help cut your debt by up to 60% of its original value, removing those high interest fees and rolling everything into one low monthly payment.
[00:23:26.758 --> 00:23:27.118]  We're good to go.
[00:23:56.267 --> 00:24:13.215]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have been all over the bird flu, the hype by governments.
[00:24:13.215 --> 00:24:18.338]  Why have they been hyping it when it hasn't been a big threat?
[00:24:26.877 --> 00:24:37.543]  Why have they been organizing their whole martial law takeover plan around an outbreak of smallpox, bird flu, SARS, and a few other micro-borne illnesses?
[00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:52.425]  I'm going to go through all the news and detail the latest developments, but we have New York, Ohio, Kansas, California, Texas, large areas of Central and Southern Mexico with outbreaks.
[00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:54.928]  We're talking to medical Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[00:24:54.928 --> 00:24:57.151]  He was out of practice in Mexico and in the United States.
[00:24:58.593 --> 00:25:03.676]  And Dr. Tenpenny, bottom line here, what do you think is going on?
[00:25:03.676 --> 00:25:10.261]  I know it's too early to fully tell, but we've got Baxter saying they're going to make a new vaccine for this.
[00:25:10.261 --> 00:25:14.344]  We've got just unprecedented fear-mongering by the media and the government.
[00:25:14.344 --> 00:25:20.408]  Is it just fear-mongering and grandstanding, or do they know something that the public doesn't know?
[00:25:20.408 --> 00:25:21.149]  You know what, Alex?
[00:25:21.149 --> 00:25:22.870]  I think it's a little bit of both.
[00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:26.853]  I think that there's some things going on that's a lot of fear-mongering.
[00:25:27.583 --> 00:25:36.712]  One of the questions, I wrote an article last night and posted it on my website, DrTentenny.com, that's called, you know, Swine Flu, the New Bird Flu.
[00:25:36.712 --> 00:25:41.817]  And some of the questions that I think are really kind of interesting that no one seems to be bringing up is the fact that
[00:25:42.324 --> 00:25:43.964]  Flu season isn't in April.
[00:25:43.964 --> 00:25:45.565]  Flu season's in October and November.
[00:25:45.565 --> 00:25:51.526]  I mean, so what is all this about, you know, all this flu stuff that's going on now, which makes me kind of question.
[00:25:51.526 --> 00:25:58.127]  Another thing is that past pandemics, as we know them and as they've been reported, have all rolled out of Southeast Asia.
[00:25:58.127 --> 00:26:04.229]  This is supposedly coming out of Mexico City, which I think is a big distinction, too, because Mexico City is the capital.
[00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:10.110]  It's way south in the Mexico, and people get Mexico City confused with the entire country of Mexico.
[00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:16.251]  Mexico City is one of the top one or two size population cities in the entire world.
[00:26:16.251 --> 00:26:20.012]  It's filthy, dirty, millions of people live on garbage dumps.
[00:26:20.012 --> 00:26:32.997]  And when I wrote my book, Foul, Bird Flu, It's Not What You Think, I made a very big and compelling argument that when you take garden variety of influenza and you mix it with dioxin and other types of chemicals, it more than doubles the death rate.
[00:26:33.527 --> 00:26:42.497]  So some of these people I think are maybe being exposed to sort of normal viruses and are getting sick and maybe those are the hundreds of people that they're not really reporting in the news.
[00:26:42.497 --> 00:26:43.037]  Exactly!
[00:26:43.037 --> 00:26:48.043]  There are hundreds of deaths a day of tuberculosis.
[00:26:48.043 --> 00:26:50.766]  They even have deaths from leprosy.
[00:26:51.306 --> 00:26:57.290]  In Mexico City, there's all sorts of people dying of just toxins.
[00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:11.598]  For those that don't know, there's 35 million people in the metro area, 28 million in the city limits itself, largest city in the world, and literal open rivers of black sewage.
[00:27:11.598 --> 00:27:15.721]  When you're there, when it's dry, there is black dust in the air that is
[00:27:15.981 --> 00:27:24.545]  Yes, and those people who don't have access to adequate medical care in simple things like clean water and good food and even a clean place to live.
[00:27:24.545 --> 00:27:28.307]  So yes, it's absolutely a festering sort of pool for that.
[00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:46.211]  I don't think so.
[00:27:58.985 --> 00:28:02.326]  And now this whole hullabaloo and this whole great big hype.
[00:28:02.326 --> 00:28:04.507]  What's your take on why that's all happened?
[00:28:04.507 --> 00:28:11.509]  Well, that's designed to further collapse Mexico under the SPP and then have even more illegal aliens come into the U.S.
[00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:16.831]  to collapse these southern and western states so they can be federalized.
[00:28:16.831 --> 00:28:21.393]  The SPP documents, the Judicial Watch sued and got from September
[00:28:22.773 --> 00:28:27.057]  2007 in Banff, Canada, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement covers all of this.
[00:28:27.057 --> 00:28:35.643]  They say, we will use economic collapse, pandemic collapse, and terror attacks to create the North American Union.
[00:28:35.643 --> 00:28:44.530]  And so, out of crises, the stronger central government in Washington believes this is how they will bring in the North American Union.
[00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:49.694]  Well, the bird flu stuff is certainly, all of those viruses, even normal viruses,
[00:28:51.445 --> 00:28:57.670]  Absolutely create a bigger cytokine storm in normal, healthy tissue.
[00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:06.857]  I document all that in my book about in normal tissue, how it destroys normal tissue in the presence of chemicals, even in very young persons.
[00:29:06.857 --> 00:29:16.165]  So, if this is some sort of a genetically modified virus, which you have to have suspicions about that, when you look at bird, swine, and human, H1N1 all kind of mixed together.
[00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:33.615]  Um, it's no doubt that people who are more toxic and have more toxins in their lungs and are going to be more susceptible to the effects of any virus, including something that may be... You know, that's a new wrinkle, but I know that I've seen the studies out of China that the toxic waste and the cramped cities and air pollution is tied to the higher death rates.
[00:29:34.395 --> 00:29:43.543]  We're not talking about race specific, we're talking about megacity, toxic load specific bioweapon, designer virus, could that be it?
[00:29:43.543 --> 00:29:46.866]  And will it mutate into a harmless strain or a more deadly strain?
[00:29:46.866 --> 00:29:50.830]  Stay there doctor, we'll come right back.
[00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.753]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:30:00.697 --> 00:30:06.101]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:14.667]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:30:14.667 --> 00:30:18.229]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:30:18.229 --> 00:30:21.471]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:30:21.471 --> 00:30:23.973]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:13.273]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.273 --> 00:31:19.717]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.717 --> 00:31:21.758]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.758 --> 00:31:24.219]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.219 --> 00:31:35.105]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.398 --> 00:31:39.059]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:40.921]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:40.921 --> 00:31:47.845]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:33:30.569 --> 00:33:36.992]  We're going to be opening the phones up at 1-800-259-9231 in the next hour.
[00:33:36.992 --> 00:33:48.358]  We'll make a few calls in this hour for people in Mexico City, listeners in south Texas, on the edge of central Texas, north of San Antonio, where they've shut down some of the schools.
[00:33:48.358 --> 00:33:52.940]  Reese, we'll go to him in a moment.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.942]  But we're going back to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[00:33:58.089 --> 00:34:06.031]  Who is joining us from Monterey, Mexico, and she's had a practice and consulted down in Mexico, so she knows it well.
[00:34:06.031 --> 00:34:09.452]  Obviously, she's down there right now as all of this is unfolding.
[00:34:09.452 --> 00:34:14.333]  A big medical conference there, and it was shut down by the Mexican authorities.
[00:34:14.333 --> 00:34:18.854]  You know, they're hundreds of miles away from Mexico Center, the epicenter of the outbreak.
[00:34:20.717 --> 00:34:40.087]  Dr. Tenpenny, that was my next question, but let's finish up with the fact that this seems to be chemical-specific flu, or that the studies do show that people that are in toxic environments, it has a much greater effect on them, or obviously people with run-down immune systems.
[00:34:40.087 --> 00:34:49.151]  And then, just as a layman who's interviewed a lot of medical doctors and virologists over the years and been studying bird flu, because I saw The Globalist typing it for the last five, six years,
[00:34:51.002 --> 00:35:04.349]  That this does look like it's a designer when you've got it not just swine, human, and pig all together, and that it happens to be a mutation that actually can affect humans.
[00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:07.591]  Most of these viruses can't when they mutate.
[00:35:07.591 --> 00:35:10.093]  And that it's coming out in the non-flu season.
[00:35:11.273 --> 00:35:20.541]  And that it's coming from an area that the flus don't normally originate from, and it's flus from all over the world.
[00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:31.711]  I mean, you start adding all that in, I guess a medical doctor could hire an insurance company to do an actuary on this, but I bet it's a billion to one or more.
[00:35:31.711 --> 00:35:33.753]  Dr. Timpeny, can you speak to that specifically?
[00:35:34.488 --> 00:36:01.865]  Yeah I can Alex and what's interesting too is what they've been saying in the Mexican news down here is that they've been seeing hundreds of people that have been sick over the last three to four weeks and that many of the people when by the time they get into the hospital they've got sort of a full-blown pneumonia and they interviewed a doctor on the on the television here last night that he was saying that many of them when they come into the emergency department they go immediately up to the intensive care and get put on a ventilator
[00:36:02.355 --> 00:36:12.162]  And that they've been passing away and several doctors, I guess, have died in some of the big hospitals, the way I understand, like young interns, people that were exposed and taking care of these people.
[00:36:12.162 --> 00:36:22.770]  So, I do believe that this is, whatever a virus this is, it's highly virulent if you combine it with other things, just like any other type of virus.
[00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:30.235]  You know, there's tens of thousands of people or millions of people every year that are exposed to garden variety influenza and they don't even get sick.
[00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:42.841]  So, there has to be, in my opinion, an underlying combination of things that allows you to be susceptible to weaponized or non-weaponized or even garden-variety influenza.
[00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:52.525]  And the studies that I put in my book, when I did the bird flu book called Fowl, It's Not What You Think, the premise was, why is this starting in Southeast Asia?
[00:36:52.525 --> 00:36:55.406]  And it led me into looking at the dioxin toxicities there.
[00:36:55.905 --> 00:37:22.716]  The Agent Orange sort of combination, the filth that's in China and in Indonesia and all of Southeast Asia, and it was looking, and the birds of how they live with their chickens, and there was a theory that I put forth, and it's that it was because of the combination of influenza, dioxin, and other chemicals that was causing these people to have virulent cases of bird flu, and then I actually found out of the medical literature support, scientific support for that premise.
[00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:30.352]  Why do you think the 1918 flu that killed more than 40 million people worldwide started at a U.S.
[00:37:30.352 --> 00:37:34.253]  military base, and why did the 76-bird flu start at a U.S.
[00:37:34.253 --> 00:37:35.334]  military base?
[00:37:35.334 --> 00:37:38.035]  Is that a connection to bioweapon?
[00:37:38.035 --> 00:37:39.235]  Oh, I think it's two things.
[00:37:39.235 --> 00:37:41.036]  I think there's two separate answers there.
[00:37:41.846 --> 00:37:45.410]  In both of those instances, those populations are highly vaccinated.
[00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:51.077]  I mean, they go into the service, they get popped with everything, including doubles and triples of things.
[00:37:51.077 --> 00:37:52.579]  And so it's a vaccine reaction.
[00:37:52.579 --> 00:37:57.705]  We know in 76, when they, as you know, doctor, tried to give the public the swine flu, it killed a bunch of people.
[00:37:57.705 --> 00:37:59.587]  And Gillian Bernays, go ahead.
[00:38:00.253 --> 00:38:08.597]  Yes, and so I think that part of it is, you know, you've created a susceptible population by vaccinating them with all these toxic vaccines.
[00:38:08.597 --> 00:38:12.199]  In the book, I talk an awful lot about in the 1918 pandemic influenza that happened.
[00:38:15.821 --> 00:38:19.824]  Um, that World War I was a chemical warfare.
[00:38:19.824 --> 00:38:27.169]  There were almost 30 different types of chemicals that were used in the front line, including mustard gas and all these other things, that the U.S.
[00:38:27.169 --> 00:38:32.192]  military was way behind on developing gas masks and all these other things.
[00:38:32.332 --> 00:38:39.634]  And by the way, these were returning troops, and I've seen the studies as well that you're reporting on, so I can back you up, Doctor.
[00:38:39.634 --> 00:38:45.456]  The returning troops at bases are then given inoculations, and then it starts spreading.
[00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:46.336]  Go ahead.
[00:38:46.336 --> 00:38:58.460]  Yeah, and they were exposed to tons, megatons, of mustard gas and a whole bunch of other types of chemicals in the front line of war when they went across the ocean in very adverse, packed, tight conditions.
[00:38:59.042 --> 00:39:06.990]  That they've been vaccinated, started to get sick, packed tight conditions, go over to Europe, get exposed to all the thousands, tens of thousands of tons.
[00:39:07.398 --> 00:39:10.300]  Of chemicals that were happening in the air with inadequate equipment.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:21.186]  So it's just like methamphetamine heads that are using street methamphetamine filled with grignardier reagents and heavy metals because of the dirty way it's produced on the street.
[00:39:21.186 --> 00:39:31.391]  That's why they can get HIV and the virus kills them because they've already had their immune system destroyed, whereas a healthy person can be exposed to HIV hundreds of times and not contract it.
[00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:32.092]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.400]  Absolutely.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:55.985]  You know, Alex, I say all the time, health is an inside-out phenomenon and our absolute terror of germs and this whole thing about the germ theory that needs to absolutely go away because the health is an inside-out phenomenon and you can't create a $500 billion a year pharmaceutical industry based on simple things that you need to do to keep yourself healthy.
[00:39:57.383 --> 00:40:11.112]  Well, I've seen studies that people that live in megacities like Beijing or even London or Mexico City, just because of what people are breathing there, that people live on average eight years less living in a megacity.
[00:40:11.112 --> 00:40:16.415]  So that, you know, the old cliche of clean country living really does have something to it.
[00:40:16.415 --> 00:40:17.476]  Absolutely.
[00:40:17.476 --> 00:40:26.302]  You know, things like, you know, fresh water, alkalinizing your body, doing detoxification, simple things like getting eight and a half hours of sleep every night consistently.
[00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:33.472]  You know, washing your hands but not inappropriately or overdoing it, eating good food and trying to avoid GMO stuff.
[00:40:33.472 --> 00:40:36.953]  I mean, all of those things is a health from an inside out phenomenon.
[00:40:36.953 --> 00:40:45.056]  You know, getting lots of vitamin D, getting out in the sunshine and avoiding all the slathering on of the sunscreens like by piles of chemicals that go in your body.
[00:40:45.558 --> 00:40:48.680]  I mean, you know, the good Lord gave us all the stuff we needed here.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.141]  It's humans that have gone along and destroyed it.
[00:40:51.141 --> 00:40:54.283]  In fact, Doctor, I'm not posing as a doctor myself.
[00:40:54.283 --> 00:40:57.144]  I go off of the medical reports and what medical doctors are saying.
[00:40:57.144 --> 00:41:06.149]  Just the sun alone, I've seen the studies that that's why we see the flus and other viruses and bacteria really running rampant in the winter.
[00:41:06.149 --> 00:41:13.893]  It's not just that we're indoors more, we're not getting that sun in our skin that, you know, literally... Makes the vitamin D. Explain that to people.
[00:41:13.893 --> 00:41:14.673]  That makes the vitamin D.
[00:41:14.913 --> 00:41:36.712]  Yeah, that makes the vitamin D. How our body intrinsically makes vitamin D is the sunshine goes on your skin, it stimulates little cells called melanocytes, and that's how you get a suntan, and from there, there's a whole long process that you create your own internal vitamin D. And it's the vitamin D, particularly vitamin D3, that all the flurry of studies that have been coming out over the last several months
[00:41:37.054 --> 00:41:47.581]  Showing that it's remarkable for almost every type of process in our body, and it's the vitamin D that goes down in the winter, when the sunshine goes down, and allows the flu viruses to come up.
[00:41:47.581 --> 00:41:51.244]  Yes, I've seen a lot of those studies too, and I really believe that's true.
[00:41:51.244 --> 00:42:03.552]  Okay, let's get back into the pandemic itself, and then I'm gonna go to Reese in Central Texas, right on the border of Central and South Texas, just north of San Antonio, where they have shut down some of the schools he called in on Saturday night.
[00:42:03.552 --> 00:42:06.234]  And we'll continue with Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[00:42:07.113 --> 00:42:36.349]  All right, now, just as a layman, throwing this out, if they're saying there's only 2,000 cases in Mexico, and from what I've heard from Mexican television and radio, and the callers from Mexico, that they go to local hospitals in not just Mexico City, but other areas, there are people vomiting, people sick, people have all they're saying for the last month, or going back into mid-March, and the Mexican government admits it's when this started, that everybody they know has been sick, callers have said they would say 70% of their families and friends
[00:42:36.929 --> 00:42:37.649]  Have been sick.
[00:42:37.649 --> 00:42:44.433]  So we know when the media says 2,000 people have gotten sick, that that's a lie.
[00:42:44.433 --> 00:42:46.874]  But in a way, that's really good news, isn't it?
[00:42:46.874 --> 00:42:57.800]  If you have hundreds of thousands or even millions that are sick, and then only 103 deaths, that shows this is just a regular flu, because regular flus of people that are unhealthy or run down or get dehydrated, it kills them.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.721]  Now, that's on the good side.
[00:42:59.721 --> 00:43:01.342]  Let's hope that's the case.
[00:43:01.342 --> 00:43:23.535]  On the bad side, maybe they're covering up the fact that there have been a lot more deaths, and we're seeing some indicators of this, and that it's mutated, and the government knows this, and that's why they're starting to lock things down, so we have to look at every angle, and I'll be doing that with other guests throughout the show today, kind of the good, the bad, and the ugly, and I know it's too early to tell, Doctor, but, I mean, clearly, they're lying about it only being 2,000 people sick, or
[00:43:25.556 --> 00:43:33.719]  Alex, it may be that they're saying there's 2,000 people sick because those 2,000 people were the ones that were sick enough to seek medical care.
[00:43:33.719 --> 00:43:45.002]  You know, there may be millions of other people, just like when the bird flu was happening back in 2006, that there were tens of thousands, maybe even millions of people that were sick, but not sick enough to go to the doctor and get care.
[00:43:45.638 --> 00:43:51.281]  And so when you don't really know what that denominator is, you can't predict what a death rate's going to be.
[00:43:51.281 --> 00:43:57.465]  If the numerator's, you know, 200 and the bottom denominator is a million, well then it's insignificant.
[00:43:57.465 --> 00:44:11.534]  What about Mexican doctors telling the BBC and myself that it's at least 20 dead per hospital in and around Mexico City and that the number was way above 200 as of Saturday?
[00:44:11.534 --> 00:44:13.475]  Again, it's a very skewed perspective.
[00:44:13.985 --> 00:44:22.451]  It's, you know, they're looking at the sickest of the sick who've made it to the hospital and probably came to the hospital because they were so sick they couldn't stay at home anymore.
[00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:29.976]  And so they, I'm sure that the numbers they're saying may be in the realm of true, but that's, I think that that's a skewed perspective.
[00:44:30.908 --> 00:44:40.530]  Okay, why would the government say there haven't been that many deaths, it's not a big deal, but then do the opposite and lock everything down and, you know, cancel all public events?
[00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:45.111]  Because what they're doing is they're following CDC guidelines and recommendations down here.
[00:44:45.111 --> 00:44:48.192]  And they actually even said that when they canceled the conference today.
[00:44:48.192 --> 00:44:56.974]  That the CDC guidelines are to stay away from crowded spaces, don't be congregated all together, and so that's what they're kind of doing.
[00:44:56.974 --> 00:44:59.715]  So, they're following the American medical hype,
[00:45:00.322 --> 00:45:05.066]  And because they don't want to be accused of not doing that and then causing more of a problem.
[00:45:05.066 --> 00:45:15.294]  So they are playing the game safe and going on the side of safety and following what the rules are being set by the CDC.
[00:45:15.294 --> 00:45:19.818]  And I guess if they're going to ban all public events, they can't selectively enforce it.
[00:45:21.283 --> 00:45:26.368]  This must be devastating the tourism industry down in Mexico and business itself.
[00:45:26.368 --> 00:45:26.628]  Oh, gosh.
[00:45:26.628 --> 00:45:27.949]  Yes, devastating it.
[00:45:27.949 --> 00:45:28.950]  It's devastating it.
[00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:33.434]  You know, the first devastation was the irresponsible reporting of the violence.
[00:45:33.434 --> 00:45:36.777]  Yes, it was happening, but it was not responsibly being reported.
[00:45:36.777 --> 00:45:41.741]  During that time, I was actually living in Rosarito and could have told you a whole lot about that.
[00:45:41.741 --> 00:45:48.427]  And so, and now what they're doing is even places like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta and Acapulco, which aren't anywhere near any of these places,
[00:45:48.863 --> 00:45:54.206]  Are all these people are loading up and they're packing up their luggage and going home for no good reason.
[00:45:54.206 --> 00:45:55.486]  Right.
[00:45:55.486 --> 00:46:02.529]  You're talking about shutting down, you know, different airlines are saying they're going to do checks at the border and and it's like, holy cow.
[00:46:02.529 --> 00:46:03.570]  That's my next question.
[00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:12.334]  People that sit in the backdrop and say and laugh at this and go, gosh, it doesn't take a whole lot to just push a button and make all them little sheep just run around like chickens without a head.
[00:46:13.012 --> 00:46:13.693]  Absolutely.
[00:46:13.693 --> 00:46:22.579]  What do you think of Napolitano, the Homeland Security head, saying, well, this, this, she said, even if this goes away in a few weeks, there's going to be another worse one soon.
[00:46:22.579 --> 00:46:24.020]  How could she make statements like that?
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:30.264]  I mean, they're clearly loving the fear and the control and using this to sell their martial law grid.
[00:46:30.264 --> 00:46:31.245]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:46:31.245 --> 00:46:39.711]  And I'll tell you, back in 2005 and 2006, I went to the first, second, and third National Bird Flu Summits held in Washington, D.C.
[00:46:39.711 --> 00:46:42.033]  to get first-hand information, take my own notes,
[00:46:42.455 --> 00:46:42.835]  We're good.
[00:47:04.031 --> 00:47:08.578]  Because they were just sort of doing it based on epidemiological or statistics.
[00:47:08.578 --> 00:47:11.542]  I mean, they're privy to stuff that you and I will never know.
[00:47:11.542 --> 00:47:19.715]  And for them to be so bold and to continue to train FEMA, Homeland Security, local departments, having vaccination drills around the country,
[00:47:20.051 --> 00:47:26.035]  I mean, this has been planned and in the works at least since 2005 and God knows how long before that.
[00:47:26.035 --> 00:47:35.481]  And Dr. Tenpenny, medical doctor, reporting to us from Monterrey, Mexico, international respected expert on this.
[00:47:35.481 --> 00:47:44.027]  Dr. Tenpenny, in Mexico right now, are you saying that the available evidence shows that this is leaning towards a genetically engineered virus?
[00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:52.977]  Or is this just them hyping a convenient virus for something they know they're going to release in the future?
[00:47:52.977 --> 00:47:54.898]  I think it's too early to say.
[00:47:54.898 --> 00:48:02.005]  I do think that there's going to be something that's going to be released, or it's going to be shown that this is a really unusual virus.
[00:48:02.005 --> 00:48:05.949]  The evidence is saying it's swine, bird flu, and human.
[00:48:05.949 --> 00:48:10.213]  Now they just had a report down here just not too long ago, maybe in the last couple of hours, saying
[00:48:10.492 --> 00:48:11.513]  That's kind of ridiculous.
[00:48:11.513 --> 00:48:13.473]  This is just an aggressive human virus.
[00:48:13.473 --> 00:48:15.675]  It's silly to be calling it swine flu.
[00:48:15.675 --> 00:48:17.816]  And I have to agree with that.
[00:48:17.816 --> 00:48:22.458]  So, I think that there's a lot of hype that's going on, a lot of hysteria.
[00:48:22.458 --> 00:48:24.419]  It never ceases to amaze me.
[00:48:24.419 --> 00:48:24.819]  Exactly.
[00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:28.761]  I mean, there are hundreds a day dying of TB alone in Mexico City and the common cold.
[00:48:28.761 --> 00:48:31.002]  So why are they hyping it now?
[00:48:31.002 --> 00:48:34.664]  And thousands dying in car accidents and people falling.
[00:48:35.705 --> 00:48:49.377]  So the question is, why are they hyping it now and then the Napolitano's say, oh get ready, something big's guaranteed to come soon, and now they're in the news saying, oh it's going to mutate.
[00:48:49.377 --> 00:48:57.724]  Well remember Alex, the US government in 2005 invested $7.1 billion into new vaccine development.
[00:48:57.724 --> 00:48:59.566]  So maybe this is a return on investment.
[00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:01.998]  This is about BioShield.
[00:49:01.998 --> 00:49:04.319]  This is about BioShield.
[00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:07.740]  We've got to start using all those vaccines that we just put into place.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:11.442]  And Division E, remember Division E that came out at the end of 2006?
[00:49:11.442 --> 00:49:26.509]  It was tacked on at the end of the defense appropriation bill that basically says that all they have to do is whisper that this may be bioterrorism and the pharmaceutical companies have 100% protection and liability for any drug
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:30.782]  Any vaccine, anything that comes out to be used against it.
[00:49:30.782 --> 00:49:36.684]  So this is about an industry that literally bankrolls the government and the media with campaign contributions and advertisement.
[00:49:36.684 --> 00:49:38.885]  Half the nightly news ads are drug ads.
[00:49:38.885 --> 00:49:48.889]  This is just about more of their fear-mongering to then sell everybody getting 2, 3, 4 deadly flu shots a year that actually debilitate your immune system and in many cases give you the flu.
[00:49:48.889 --> 00:49:51.030]  And also use Tamiflu.
[00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:56.052]  Now Tamiflu, I documented in the book, that the more you use Tamiflu, the more resistance to viruses come.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:07.130]  That by the fourth dose of Tamiflu, a garden variety influenza virus can be up to 10 million times more resistant to Tamiflu than it was before it was exposed to the drug.
[00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:10.373]  So it's making them resistant just like bacteria with antibiotics.
[00:50:10.373 --> 00:50:11.954]  Exactly.
[00:50:11.954 --> 00:50:12.555]  Exactly.
[00:50:13.522 --> 00:50:20.190]  Okay, we've got a lot of phone calls here coming up, but in the final segment, Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, I want to give out your website for folks that want to learn more.
[00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:22.272]  I did read your excellent report this morning.
[00:50:22.272 --> 00:50:24.034]  People should see that.
[00:50:24.034 --> 00:50:25.356]  Swine flu, the new bird flu.
[00:50:25.356 --> 00:50:27.919]  We do have calls from Mexico, calls from Texas.
[00:50:27.919 --> 00:50:31.443]  We will be getting to those, but I wanted to talk to you about the control grid.
[00:50:31.883 --> 00:50:34.223]  You know, it's not a rumor about FEMA mass graves.
[00:50:34.223 --> 00:50:35.844]  We have the documents.
[00:50:35.844 --> 00:50:38.064]  So I want to mention those when we get back.
[00:50:38.064 --> 00:50:43.705]  Is this a beta test to train everybody how to go along and follow orders for the real crisis that's coming?
[00:50:43.705 --> 00:50:48.426]  Why is Europe testing all Americans and Mexican flights coming in?
[00:50:48.426 --> 00:50:50.146]  Why are they banning imports from the U.S.
[00:50:50.146 --> 00:50:50.786]  and Mexico?
[00:50:50.786 --> 00:50:53.747]  This is becoming a worldwide hype fest.
[00:50:53.747 --> 00:50:59.028]  Why is this flu coming out of the Western Hemisphere and not out of Asia as it normally does?
[00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:08.196]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:51:08.196 --> 00:51:24.112]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[00:51:24.412 --> 00:51:29.777]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:51:29.777 --> 00:51:36.302]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:51:36.302 --> 00:51:40.186]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:51:40.186 --> 00:51:42.888]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[00:51:42.888 --> 00:51:48.253]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:51:48.553 --> 00:51:51.234]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:51:51.234 --> 00:51:53.454]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:51:53.454 --> 00:51:55.955]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:51:55.955 --> 00:52:01.356]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[00:52:01.356 --> 00:52:07.198]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.198 --> 00:52:14.160]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.753 --> 00:52:21.336]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.336 --> 00:52:23.317]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.317 --> 00:52:25.819]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.819 --> 00:52:37.384]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.384 --> 00:52:39.065]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.065 --> 00:52:40.426]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.914 --> 00:52:47.817]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.817 --> 00:52:56.080]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.660]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:58.861]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.785 --> 00:53:06.751]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[00:53:06.751 --> 00:53:07.511]  Think about that.
[00:53:07.511 --> 00:53:10.634]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[00:53:10.634 --> 00:53:13.857]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:17.641]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Choose for Health.
[00:53:17.981 --> 00:53:24.087]  A delicious tasting chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables and antioxidants.
[00:53:24.087 --> 00:53:29.913]  Unlike hard to digest pills, Chews for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[00:53:29.913 --> 00:53:31.094]  The choice is yours.
[00:53:31.094 --> 00:53:36.719]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[00:53:36.719 --> 00:53:37.420]  Chews for Health.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.320]  We're good to go.
[00:54:13.564 --> 00:54:17.628]  We've had Dr. Sherry Tenpenny on all of this for the last 40 minutes.
[00:54:17.628 --> 00:54:20.331]  I'm going to give you my take on all of this coming up the next hour.
[00:54:20.331 --> 00:54:25.135]  Paul Watson will give us a European view from the United Kingdom coming up in about 35 minutes.
[00:54:25.135 --> 00:54:32.342]  We've got calls from Texas, California, Canada, Mexico, you name it, that are coming up.
[00:54:32.342 --> 00:54:34.124]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest.
[00:54:34.124 --> 00:54:38.428]  You know, I have the State of New York Department of State Division of Cemeteries
[00:54:39.028 --> 00:54:40.529]  Secret document, April 4, 2007.
[00:54:40.529 --> 00:54:45.391]  That's up on InfoWars.com, linked in a story Aaron Dykes did.
[00:54:45.391 --> 00:54:49.193]  Plans for mass graves confirmed, government surveying, cemetery readiness.
[00:54:49.193 --> 00:55:03.000]  We talked to the city officials in Indiana with the Illinois officials, with FEMA coming to them saying, we want you to harden all the government buildings for terror attack, even in rural towns, and prepare mass graves for a flu outbreak.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.482]  And that's what this division of cemeteries document says.
[00:55:06.482 --> 00:55:09.785]  And then I have the executive orders, the feds have the state pass...
[00:55:11.823 --> 00:55:18.606]  Colorado, Rocky Mountain News, February 2003 for mass graves, incinerators, you name it.
[00:55:18.606 --> 00:55:24.529]  And under the dark winter top-off drills, they admittedly practice locking down cities, putting people in sports stadiums.
[00:55:24.529 --> 00:55:33.272]  And under this new alert that they've issued, that's then taking the safety off the system that would engage open physical martial law.
[00:55:33.272 --> 00:55:34.373]  Dr. Sherri Tenpenny.
[00:55:35.492 --> 00:55:43.496]  Well Alex, I think that the most important part of all of that is that not everybody is going to die and not everybody is going to get sick.
[00:55:43.496 --> 00:56:04.866]  So the people, and I think the people who are more toxic in their systems from chemical exposures, from genetically modified foods, from eating, you know, McDonald's trans fats things, I think that those and all the people that are fully vaccinated and have their immune systems all tied up with that are going to be more susceptible whether it's a weaponized sort of flu or not.
[00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:08.991]  And so that goes back to, you know, trying to do health from the inside out.
[00:56:08.991 --> 00:56:12.491]  There's some great books and programs out there about detoxification.
[00:56:12.491 --> 00:56:18.132]  Just quickly, doctor, I want to interrupt you and while I have you, are you still going to be in Mexico tomorrow?
[00:56:18.132 --> 00:56:21.873]  Because I'd like to get you back on tomorrow for 30 minutes with a quick report.
[00:56:21.873 --> 00:56:22.653]  Yeah, I am.
[00:56:22.653 --> 00:56:26.394]  In fact, my husband and I decided that we're not going to panic and be a bunch of sheep.
[00:56:26.394 --> 00:56:29.954]  We're going to stay down here till Saturday, just like our plane tickets were supposed to be.
[00:56:29.954 --> 00:56:34.375]  What time zone are you in right now there in Mexico?
[00:56:35.196 --> 00:56:35.817]  Pardon me?
[00:56:35.817 --> 00:56:38.262]  What time is it in Mexico right now where you're at?
[00:56:38.262 --> 00:56:38.783]  It's noon.
[00:56:38.783 --> 00:56:39.785]  It's central time here.
[00:56:39.785 --> 00:56:40.507]  Uh-huh.
[00:56:40.507 --> 00:56:41.188]  Okay, same here.
[00:56:41.188 --> 00:56:42.591]  We're central standard time.
[00:56:42.591 --> 00:56:43.573]  How about 1130 again tomorrow?
[00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:46.230]  Perfect.
[00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:47.170]  Okay, we'll call you 1130.
[00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:52.332]  In closing, Doctor, what are some things over the counter?
[00:56:52.332 --> 00:57:02.514]  I mean, some people have said if you take like elderberry, that is a immune booster that could cause the autoimmune response that's actually killing people.
[00:57:02.514 --> 00:57:07.475]  And you know, with some other flus, I mean, is it garlic, vitamin C?
[00:57:07.475 --> 00:57:09.816]  What would you tell people that are afraid to do?
[00:57:09.816 --> 00:57:13.517]  Vitamin C, vitamin A is the most amazing antiviral.
[00:57:14.402 --> 00:57:16.524]  I think that those two are really great.
[00:57:16.524 --> 00:57:19.587]  Simple things like we already said, be sure you get to bed on time.
[00:57:19.587 --> 00:57:23.049]  The more sleep you can get, the more healthy you're going to be.
[00:57:23.049 --> 00:57:27.073]  You know, those are really, really important stuff that I think are really important.
[00:57:27.073 --> 00:57:37.801]  There's a lot of things on my website, the DrTenPenny.com that gives a lot of information about that and it really, lots of vitamin C, vitamin A, garlic.
[00:57:37.801 --> 00:57:39.583]  Some people use colloidal silver.
[00:57:39.583 --> 00:57:41.024]  Some people use homeopathics.
[00:57:41.748 --> 00:57:45.489]  There are lots of ways to keep healthy from the inside out.
[00:57:45.489 --> 00:57:46.789]  Absolutely.
[00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:48.290]  Anything else?
[00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:50.710]  I mean, is garlic good?
[00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:52.490]  Is oil of oregano good?
[00:57:52.490 --> 00:58:00.772]  Oil of oregano, I'm glad you mentioned that, Alex, because that is fantastic and we've known that that has some great resistance against even some of the tougher types of flu strains.
[00:58:00.772 --> 00:58:03.673]  Lots of vitamin D. Summer's coming, get out in some sunshine.
[00:58:03.673 --> 00:58:07.394]  If you can't do that, get some vitamin D and do at least 5,000 units a day.
[00:58:09.062 --> 00:58:22.869]  You know, they've done studies that have shown up to 40 or 50,000 units with no toxicity, 10,000 units a day without any toxicity, so at least 5,000 units of vitamin D a day until this whole thing blows through to keep you and your family healthy.
[00:58:22.869 --> 00:58:28.192]  And that needs to be the organic versions of all of that, not the chemical, synthetic variants?
[00:58:28.192 --> 00:58:29.813]  Absolutely.
[00:58:29.813 --> 00:58:33.615]  Alright, Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, thank you so much for spending the time with us.
[00:58:33.615 --> 00:58:36.176]  We'll get a report from Mexico with you tomorrow.
[00:58:36.752 --> 00:58:39.194]  Sounds perfect Alex, take care, talk to you then.
[00:58:39.194 --> 00:58:42.195]  Alright, thank you.
[00:58:42.195 --> 00:58:43.816]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.816 --> 00:58:46.158]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.694 --> 00:58:52.376]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.376 --> 00:58:57.122]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.122 --> 00:59:00.086]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.086 --> 00:59:03.130]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:08.978]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.198 --> 00:59:12.441]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[00:59:39.862 --> 00:59:41.843]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.484 --> 00:59:55.886]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.886 --> 01:00:05.235]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:06.536]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.297]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.297 --> 01:00:10.059]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.059 --> 01:00:11.640]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.222]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.222 --> 01:00:17.386]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.386 --> 01:00:19.728]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.598 --> 01:00:22.419]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:26.442]  We are covering this new mutagen flu that we're seeing record hype.
[01:00:26.442 --> 01:00:35.469]  100 plus deaths confirmed in Mexico from the virus, but the regular flu kills tens of thousands a year down there.
[01:00:35.469 --> 01:00:36.370]  Same in the U.S.
[01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:37.831]  So why is the media hyping it?
[01:00:38.803 --> 01:00:45.146]  This could be the big one, or is it just more hype in preparation for the globalists to launch a controlled bioweapons release on the public?
[01:00:45.146 --> 01:00:46.127]  They are eugenicists.
[01:00:46.127 --> 01:00:48.288]  They've said they've been planning to do it for a long time.
[01:00:48.288 --> 01:00:50.049]  So we have to look at that angle.
[01:00:50.049 --> 01:00:56.212]  And you just heard an angle that was an optimistic one from Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, medical doctor.
[01:00:57.492 --> 01:00:58.753]  Who knows what we're going to be hearing.
[01:00:58.753 --> 01:01:04.556]  I would imagine it'll be the dark side of the dark view from somebody who predicted this just last Monday.
[01:01:04.556 --> 01:01:11.279]  And that is, of course, Steve Quayle coming up in T-minus one hour, 59 minutes.
[01:01:11.279 --> 01:01:15.862]  We got Paul Watson popping in with a British view for about 10 minutes at the bottom of this hour.
[01:01:15.862 --> 01:01:19.323]  I want to take a lot of calls right now and get your take on what's happening.
[01:01:19.323 --> 01:01:23.466]  And then I'm going to go through all the latest news and give you my view on what's going on.
[01:01:24.522 --> 01:01:29.584]  Coming up, but right now, let's talk to Reese calling from just north of San Antonio.
[01:01:29.584 --> 01:01:34.807]  He called Saturday and broke that they were going to be just suspending class all next week.
[01:01:34.807 --> 01:01:36.347]  That was before it was in the news.
[01:01:36.347 --> 01:01:42.390]  It then came out the next morning that indeed they weren't just suspending it on Monday, they were suspending it throughout the week.
[01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:47.472]  Now schools all over South Texas and areas of Central Texas are shutting down.
[01:01:47.472 --> 01:01:51.534]  I guess the wicked fleeth when none pursueth because you've got 20 cases
[01:01:53.996 --> 01:01:55.596]  And that's always a day-old number.
[01:01:55.596 --> 01:01:56.897]  It's probably more than that.
[01:01:56.897 --> 01:01:59.377]  In the United States, why all the fear-mongering?
[01:01:59.377 --> 01:02:03.038]  Why is the media saying, oh, it's going to mutate into something more deadly?
[01:02:03.038 --> 01:02:06.338]  When I look at the statistics, they normally mutate into something less deadly.
[01:02:06.338 --> 01:02:08.839]  But we'll look at all angles and all sides.
[01:02:08.839 --> 01:02:15.020]  Going to Reese in the border of San Antonio there, right in the town where they have confirmed cases.
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:17.220]  Reese, tell us what's happening.
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:18.521]  All right.
[01:02:18.521 --> 01:02:19.781]  Not too much has changed here.
[01:02:21.365 --> 01:02:27.268]  News report out of the San Antonio Express News here, uh, says Linda Moses, uh, sick.
[01:02:27.268 --> 01:02:28.488]  Her and her sons are sick.
[01:02:28.488 --> 01:02:33.251]  One attends, uh, Clemens High School, which is the other high school in this district.
[01:02:33.251 --> 01:02:37.293]  Uh, they have a suspected or confirmed local cases, uh, climbed to 12.
[01:02:38.744 --> 01:02:45.111]  I know that one suspected case is that... Oh, so it's now 12 cases in your town alone, and the National U.S.
[01:02:45.111 --> 01:02:51.798]  News, even though they know the San Antonio Express News says that, the National News is saying 20 cases nationwide.
[01:02:51.798 --> 01:02:58.905]  When you get Paul Watson or Kurt or Steve with a blurb on this, what's the headline on that San Antonio Express News article?
[01:02:58.905 --> 01:03:00.767]  Okay, it says, let me see here...
[01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:03.930]  It's at MySANews.com.
[01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:05.851]  It's just a little blog comment.
[01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:08.273]  And it says SCUC closes all schools.
[01:03:08.273 --> 01:03:10.755]  Say that slower.
[01:03:10.755 --> 01:03:12.697]  Give me that acronym again slowly.
[01:03:12.697 --> 01:03:12.997]  Okay.
[01:03:12.997 --> 01:03:16.480]  It's SCUC ISD closes all schools.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.463]  That's the name of the... SCUC closes all schools.
[01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:21.724]  SCUC ISD.
[01:03:21.724 --> 01:03:25.086]  That's short for Universal City ISD.
[01:03:25.086 --> 01:03:26.387]  And that closes all schools.
[01:03:29.324 --> 01:03:34.169]  Looks like there's actually another suspected case at the school that my mom actually teaches at.
[01:03:34.169 --> 01:03:37.733]  So that's kind of scary.
[01:03:37.733 --> 01:03:43.659]  But, you know, I think people around here are starting to actually start to take this a little seriously.
[01:03:43.659 --> 01:03:51.287]  And, you know, people are, they're just, they're not as in a sort of a haze like they were on Saturday when I called you kind of in a panic.
[01:03:52.486 --> 01:04:05.142]  Well, the issue here is we should be concerned because this global government and the CDC, our eugenicists, have staged chemical, biological, radiological attacks on people worldwide.
[01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:07.646]  They have killed troops and foster children and others.
[01:04:09.815 --> 01:04:15.641]  This is on record the government weaponized anthrax was mailed out to George Bush's enemies.
[01:04:15.641 --> 01:04:22.288]  The White House admitted the whole cabinet was on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic, before it even broke out.
[01:04:22.288 --> 01:04:24.590]  So they have this past history.
[01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:26.191]  They're preparing with mass graves.
[01:04:27.369 --> 01:04:32.911]  For this, and so the fact that they're saying it's such a big danger and hyping it is why we're having to look at it.
[01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:41.095]  But, if you really only had 100 deaths in Mexico, regular flu kills people, so this is hype.
[01:04:41.095 --> 01:04:42.055]  So we don't know yet.
[01:04:42.055 --> 01:04:42.475]  Stay there.
[01:04:42.475 --> 01:04:45.516]  I want to hear more from you when we get back.
[01:04:45.516 --> 01:04:52.279]  Reese, joining us from the town where one of the biggest outbreaks in the country has taken place, and more of your calls.

[01:05:11.764 --> 01:05:13.184]  Garden in a Can!

[01:05:51.409 --> 01:05:53.030]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:06:03.962 --> 01:06:06.586]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:06.586 --> 01:06:13.596]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:14.173 --> 01:06:20.357]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:20.357 --> 01:06:22.718]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:22.718 --> 01:06:25.240]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:36.187]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:36.807 --> 01:06:38.469]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:38.469 --> 01:06:40.330]  It's about a one world government.
[01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:47.236]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:06:57.085 --> 01:06:58.286]  The people strike back.

[01:08:14.161 --> 01:08:15.742]  We have the information.
[01:08:15.742 --> 01:08:17.364]  We have the numbers.
[01:08:17.364 --> 01:08:24.289]  We have the people willing to take on the New World Order in the Info War, and physically, if need be.
[01:08:24.289 --> 01:08:25.350]  We've got the will.
[01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:26.411]  There is a way.
[01:08:26.411 --> 01:08:28.473]  The New World Order is coming down.
[01:08:28.473 --> 01:08:29.133]  You have found it.
[01:08:29.133 --> 01:08:31.435]  The front lines in the Info War.
[01:08:31.435 --> 01:08:32.756]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:08:32.756 --> 01:08:35.418]  Yes, here is the San Antonio Express News Headline.
[01:08:35.418 --> 01:08:38.161]  SCUC ISD closes all schools.
[01:08:39.531 --> 01:08:44.355]  The number of suspected or confirmed local cases of swine flu climbed to 12.
[01:08:44.355 --> 01:08:50.120]  Now they're still saying in the national news, on Drudge and everywhere else, 20 cases in the U.S.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:55.744]  One outbreak, just south of me, 45 miles from where I sit, has 12.
[01:08:55.744 --> 01:09:01.369]  The district also canceled today's planned public meeting at Steele High School.
[01:09:02.776 --> 01:09:06.679]  Where the two Texas cases of swine flu were confirmed last Friday.
[01:09:06.679 --> 01:09:09.702]  Another 10 suspected cases are being tested.
[01:09:09.702 --> 01:09:15.066]  Okay, real quick, anything else, Reese, that you need to add, sir?
[01:09:15.066 --> 01:09:17.328]  Just one more thing.
[01:09:17.328 --> 01:09:24.553]  I'm a regular at the Prison Planet Forums, and they all brought up a good point here, and that's where do chemtrails factor in the equation?
[01:09:24.553 --> 01:09:30.418]  Because I know you were talking with the doctor about lower immune systems in Mexico as possibly being why it spread so fast.
[01:09:31.095 --> 01:09:36.058]  And we know that there's heavy metals in these chemtrails, that they've been spraying us so long.
[01:09:36.058 --> 01:09:42.121]  That's what she was saying, was that we know barium salts and aluminum dioxide and all this lowers the immune system.
[01:09:42.121 --> 01:09:46.463]  That is a very interesting point.
[01:09:46.463 --> 01:09:47.383]  Excellent point, Reese.
[01:09:49.721 --> 01:09:55.445]  Yeah, we need to link to some of the Prison Planet Forum articles that people are writing and compiling and putting together.
[01:09:55.445 --> 01:10:01.570]  You know, I was doing searches Saturday for our special report trying to find the fake newscast.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:14.908]  That Nightline did in 2002, where they just started out with a newscast saying, we've been attacked with smallpox, people are dying, martial law, they showed footage of real riots after hurricanes and real looting and people panicked.
[01:10:14.908 --> 01:10:25.115]  And it was meant to be a PSYOP, then at the end of the show they said, oh this was just a drill, and then they did it the next four nights as things unfolded, continuing to announce it as if it was real.
[01:10:25.115 --> 01:10:27.897]  I taped that when it was on, and by the second night,
[01:10:28.417 --> 01:10:39.762]  And I obviously can't find it in all our storage buildings and the rest of it used to be just me around here, so it's all a big jumbled mess, but I couldn't find that on YouTube or Google, but I did find something I'd never seen!
[01:10:39.762 --> 01:10:42.443]  Now, I knew they did Dark Winter.
[01:10:42.443 --> 01:10:45.284]  Queue that up, please, that video.
[01:10:45.284 --> 01:10:46.585]  I knew they did Dark Winter.
[01:10:46.585 --> 01:10:54.548]  I talk about that in my famous July 25th TV show where I say, call the White House, tell them don't stage terror attacks in the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset Osama Bin Laden.
[01:10:55.379 --> 01:11:02.545]  And I read the AP article about Dark Winter, about martial law in Texas and Oklahoma because of smallpox breaking out.
[01:11:02.545 --> 01:11:04.787]  So I had the Drill article in July.
[01:11:04.787 --> 01:11:09.872]  From June, when they did the Drill, here is the June Drill by Homeland Security.
[01:11:09.872 --> 01:11:13.415]  We're going to play this again later, it's so important.
[01:11:13.415 --> 01:11:16.918]  I didn't get to it all yesterday at the end of the show, the Sunday show.
[01:11:16.918 --> 01:11:19.480]  Here is the Drill.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.982]  Homeland Security puts it on that didn't exist supposedly until 2002.
[01:11:24.256 --> 01:11:32.551]  And in it, they're saying Saddam Hussein's working with the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and we've got to hit them for attacking us.
[01:11:32.551 --> 01:11:34.835]  See, they were already, they showed these fake newscasts to
[01:11:36.195 --> 01:11:38.336]  Different universities and medical groups.
[01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:45.021]  They showed it to the Feds and local first responders to scare them into taking smallpox shots, which they then refused to do, as you know.
[01:11:45.021 --> 01:11:46.422]  But this was all preparatory.
[01:11:46.422 --> 01:11:51.085]  You can see how premeditated and wicked all of this is, so that's coming up later.
[01:11:51.085 --> 01:12:05.635]  Another big issue is, I've forgotten about this, and all my bird flu research and all the doctors we've interviewed, and Dr. Sherry Tinpenny just talked about this medical doctor, it's proven that Tamiflu, owned by Rumsfeld, the Bushes, and Obama's got a big stake in it,
[01:12:06.495 --> 01:12:22.584]  There's stocks soaring right now that Tamiflu when you take it does knock out the virus but causes it to only be certain mutations that survive so it makes it that much more powerful and resistant just like antibiotics with bacteria.
[01:12:22.584 --> 01:12:27.407]  So you got people worldwide buying Tamiflu all the people that are
[01:12:29.636 --> 01:12:35.599]  You know, who medicalize everything, all the people that are scared, all the hypochondriacs.
[01:12:35.599 --> 01:12:36.699]  And I don't blame you.
[01:12:36.699 --> 01:12:37.760]  I was never a hypochondriac.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.061]  Once you have children, you kind of become a hypochondriac for them.
[01:12:40.061 --> 01:12:41.581]  You know, you love them so much.
[01:12:41.581 --> 01:12:49.245]  And they're putting them on Tamiflu everywhere, which then, if they've got any other regular flu viruses in them, that people come in contact with every day, folks.
[01:12:49.245 --> 01:12:50.445]  You come in contact with flu and...
[01:12:52.046 --> 01:12:54.329]  Regular cold viruses and everything else.
[01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:55.630]  And your body defeats it.
[01:12:55.630 --> 01:12:58.573]  Well, this thing mutates them and makes them that much stronger.
[01:12:58.573 --> 01:13:00.014]  So everybody's gobbling this.
[01:13:00.014 --> 01:13:03.818]  That's why so many deadly bacteria come out of Latin America.
[01:13:03.818 --> 01:13:07.502]  Because they sell antibiotics like candy there.
[01:13:07.502 --> 01:13:12.307]  And people are always gobbling it for viral infections which makes the bacteria that much stronger.
[01:13:12.307 --> 01:13:13.829]  Okay, let's run through a bunch of calls here.
[01:13:15.063 --> 01:13:16.464]  You know, I'm surprised.
[01:13:16.464 --> 01:13:18.665]  I did the Saturday show and the Sunday show.
[01:13:18.665 --> 01:13:24.049]  The Saturday show I came in was only internet streams at Infowars.com.
[01:13:24.049 --> 01:13:28.732]  We had about 9,000 listeners that tuned in to the pretty much unannounced live show.
[01:13:28.732 --> 01:13:31.714]  And a few thousand Prison Planet.TV viewers.
[01:13:31.714 --> 01:13:34.215]  And we got calls from Mexico City, you name it.
[01:13:34.215 --> 01:13:36.737]  Calls from where they had quarantines in Canada.
[01:13:36.737 --> 01:13:39.399]  Today, here's the big show on AM and FM.
[01:13:39.399 --> 01:13:41.020]  Shortwave, satellite, internet.
[01:13:41.892 --> 01:13:50.877]  You know, just dwarfing the Saturday show, and dwarfing even the Sunday show, and no one is calling from Mexico City.
[01:13:50.877 --> 01:13:53.218]  I want to give that number out again, the local number.
[01:13:54.209 --> 01:13:58.052]  Some people can't call 1-800 numbers from Mexico into the U.S.
[01:13:58.052 --> 01:14:01.274]  What's the toll-free number into our board here directly in Austin, Texas?
[01:14:01.274 --> 01:14:04.216]  Can you guys punch that up for me again, please, so I can see it?
[01:14:04.216 --> 01:14:05.517]  The number?
[01:14:05.517 --> 01:14:05.737]  It's 512-646-1776.
[01:14:05.737 --> 01:14:05.797]  512-646-1776.
[01:14:05.797 --> 01:14:05.837]  512-646-1770.
[01:14:16.825 --> 01:14:18.647]  6 or 888-201-2244.
[01:14:18.647 --> 01:14:21.188]  Alright, let's go to some calls.
[01:14:21.188 --> 01:14:24.150]  Randy in California, where they have outbreaks of this.
[01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:25.011]  Randy, you're on the air.
[01:14:46.508 --> 01:14:57.335]  I go on graffiti rampages, spraying infowars.com all over the city, recently got caught for that, got put in jail, but now that I'm out, I print out hundreds of custom posters I make myself, and I tape them everywhere.
[01:14:57.335 --> 01:15:00.877]  I'm trying to get the word out, trying to wake everyone up.
[01:15:00.877 --> 01:15:01.978]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:15:01.978 --> 01:15:05.940]  When I was, you know, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
[01:15:17.631 --> 01:15:25.516]  My parents still didn't really listen to me, even when I was a well-known radio talk show host by the age of 23.
[01:15:25.516 --> 01:15:25.636]  22.
[01:15:25.636 --> 01:15:28.538]  My parents still didn't really respect me.
[01:15:28.538 --> 01:15:36.403]  Now that I have a wife, children, and they see that I pay my bills on time, they now respect me and ask for advice.
[01:15:36.403 --> 01:15:44.348]  It is normal, when you're a teenager or a young man, for older folks not to listen to you.
[01:15:44.348 --> 01:15:45.509]  They don't think it's your place.
[01:15:46.732 --> 01:15:50.176]  You know, there's cases of a young person running in and saying a building's on fire.
[01:15:50.176 --> 01:15:57.325]  You know, famous cases, and people laugh at them and don't believe it, and then walk outside 20 minutes later because they smell smoke.
[01:15:57.325 --> 01:15:58.566]  So don't feel bad.
[01:15:58.566 --> 01:16:05.194]  Now, know that handing out flyers, putting up posters, things like that, if it's done well, that will affect people.
[01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:06.095]  People are listening.
[01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:06.316]  Listen.
[01:16:07.645 --> 01:16:12.868]  Fox News, CNN, MSNBC are saying they love Ron Paul and hate the New World Order now.
[01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:19.971]  So they're really, you know, even CIA agent Anderson Cooper comes on, Astor Fortunehead, and says, oh, I don't like the New World Order.
[01:16:19.971 --> 01:16:22.932]  The people aren't going to like hearing about the New World Order or the G20.
[01:16:22.932 --> 01:16:25.114]  So, we are the majority.
[01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:28.635]  It's just that people arrogantly are disrespecting you.
[01:16:28.635 --> 01:16:29.696]  Just keep warning them.
[01:16:30.276 --> 01:16:36.781]  You're only trying to save them, and you already have enough respect for yourself, more than most, to be bold.
[01:16:36.781 --> 01:16:38.002]  That's the first step.
[01:16:38.002 --> 01:16:41.604]  The other step is not caring.
[01:16:41.604 --> 01:16:46.468]  Continue what you're doing, but go ahead, Randy.
[01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:54.113]  If the older people are not going to wake up, it's up to the youth to take over, to take the baton, and continue the fight.
[01:16:54.113 --> 01:16:58.176]  Because if the old people are already compartmentalized, they can't understand,
[01:16:58.922 --> 01:17:03.328]  Young people with a fresh, clean state, they'll be able to wake up and take the system down.
[01:17:15.267 --> 01:17:20.209]  Whether they're young or old, have been mesmerized by the television, are kind of in a comfort zone.
[01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:25.912]  It's hard to shock them out of that, and it always looks like you're not having an effect until the whole thing collapses.
[01:17:25.912 --> 01:17:27.312]  Believe me.
[01:17:27.312 --> 01:17:28.593]  We're having victories.
[01:17:28.593 --> 01:17:31.394]  They're canceling trans-Texas NAFTA highways.
[01:17:31.394 --> 01:17:33.775]  They're having to back off on gun bans.
[01:17:33.775 --> 01:17:35.936]  They're having to back off on the North American Union.
[01:17:35.936 --> 01:17:38.918]  The Euro expansion is failing in Europe.
[01:17:38.918 --> 01:17:41.679]  The America's Union is failing in Latin America.
[01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:44.988]  The bankers are universally hated.
[01:17:44.988 --> 01:17:47.288]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:54.591]  Believe me, folks, don't listen to Tokyo Rose and the New World Order when they tell you, lay down GI, you're losing the fight.
[01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:57.612]  I mean, that's kind of like Baghdad Bob.
[01:17:57.612 --> 01:18:04.034]  As you can see, mortars exploding two miles behind him, saying the Americans have been repulsed, they're 100 miles from Baghdad.
[01:18:04.926 --> 01:18:08.509]  I mean, he was a con... and people watched it and almost believed him.
[01:18:08.509 --> 01:18:10.911]  I remember people on TV were going, well, maybe it's true.
[01:18:10.911 --> 01:18:14.834]  And I said, no, folks, he's a liar.
[01:18:14.834 --> 01:18:16.316]  It's propaganda.
[01:18:16.316 --> 01:18:20.359]  But it's so bold... In fact, pull up Baghdad, Bob.
[01:18:20.359 --> 01:18:21.820]  I want to play a clip of him later.
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:24.302]  Yes, the Americans, we have completely destroyed them.
[01:18:24.302 --> 01:18:28.386]  They are 100 miles away, in retreat, we killed 20,000.
[01:18:28.386 --> 01:18:32.409]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jared in California.
[01:18:32.409 --> 01:18:33.170]  Jared, you're on the air.
[01:18:35.384 --> 01:18:36.484]  Come on, Jared.
[01:18:36.484 --> 01:18:37.224]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:18:37.224 --> 01:18:38.445]  I'm on.
[01:18:38.445 --> 01:18:40.065]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:18:40.065 --> 01:18:46.186]  I am the vice president of a club that me and my friend just started at our university.
[01:18:46.186 --> 01:18:48.266]  It's called the Free Republican.
[01:18:48.266 --> 01:19:01.928]  We are making Obama Deception videos and our campus coordinator won't let us do a fundraiser where we can hand them out or sell them or anything like that without your permission.
[01:19:01.928 --> 01:19:04.569]  We were just wondering who we could email with that.
[01:19:05.526 --> 01:19:10.429]  Well, look, that's just them being petty and using mind control.
[01:19:10.429 --> 01:19:16.952]  It would be for a civil court to decide whether you could hand those out even if I said you couldn't.
[01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:18.012]  Okay?
[01:19:18.012 --> 01:19:21.394]  And so, you have a student group, you're allowed to operate.
[01:19:21.394 --> 01:19:27.377]  If there's no charge against you, you know, you're not guilty until proven innocent.
[01:19:27.377 --> 01:19:27.697]  Okay?
[01:19:27.697 --> 01:19:30.099]  You're innocent until proven guilty.
[01:19:31.013 --> 01:19:33.395]  And so they can't violate your First Amendment.
[01:19:33.395 --> 01:19:35.596]  Give them this MP3 file.
[01:19:35.596 --> 01:19:40.499]  I tell everybody, make all the copies you want for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:19:40.499 --> 01:19:42.781]  Distribute the film to whoever you want.
[01:19:42.781 --> 01:19:51.767]  And the school can't preemptively tell you, oh, we have to, you know, make you bring us all this paperwork before you have your student group being allowed to do this.
[01:19:51.767 --> 01:19:53.288]  Okay, so there you go.
[01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.289]  It's free on YouTube.
[01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:55.469]  It's free on Google.
[01:19:55.469 --> 01:20:00.493]  You can hand out flyers with a URL address of the YouTube, change the channel version.
[01:20:00.493 --> 01:20:00.813]  Stay there.
[01:20:01.613 --> 01:20:07.115]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:20:07.115 --> 01:20:07.916]  and the world.
[01:20:07.916 --> 01:20:11.777]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:20:11.777 --> 01:20:18.280]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.301]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:20:20.301 --> 01:20:28.244]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:29.185]  We're good to go.
[01:20:53.442 --> 01:20:57.226]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.325 --> 01:21:13.186]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:13.186 --> 01:21:19.628]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:19.628 --> 01:21:21.668]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:21.668 --> 01:21:24.129]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:35.011]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:37.313 --> 01:21:38.973]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:38.973 --> 01:21:40.834]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:40.834 --> 01:21:47.755]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:21:47.755 --> 01:21:56.017]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:56.017 --> 01:21:57.578]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.578 --> 01:21:58.778]  The people strike back.
[01:22:00.535 --> 01:22:07.200]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:15.326]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:15.326 --> 01:22:23.492]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:23.492 --> 01:22:28.236]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.556 --> 01:22:33.797]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:33.797 --> 01:22:38.138]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:38.138 --> 01:22:39.219]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:39.219 --> 01:22:43.720]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.621]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:48.621 --> 01:22:51.622]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:22:51.622 --> 01:22:53.262]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:56.448 --> 01:22:59.831]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.831 --> 01:23:08.079]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:23:08.079 --> 01:23:12.643]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:23:12.643 --> 01:23:17.308]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:23:17.308 --> 01:23:18.709]  It's a documented fact.
[01:23:18.749 --> 01:23:19.149]  We're good to go!
[01:23:37.649 --> 01:23:38.429]  Once a day.
[01:23:38.429 --> 01:23:42.711]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[01:23:42.711 --> 01:23:45.852]  A 2 month supply starts at just $17.
[01:23:45.852 --> 01:23:49.593]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.

[01:23:53.095 --> 01:23:53.475]  That's 888-949-3570.
[01:24:04.498 --> 01:24:23.127]  Okay, I got a lot of medical workers and other people calling in and I got two different phone systems here.
[01:24:23.127 --> 01:24:24.968]  Who is the medical worker in Texas?
[01:24:24.968 --> 01:24:27.289]  Is that Jesse?
[01:24:27.289 --> 01:24:29.070]  Okay, let's go to Jesse in Texas.
[01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:30.031]  Jesse, you're on the air.
[01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:30.371]  Go ahead.
[01:24:31.955 --> 01:24:35.376]  I'm honored to speak with you.
[01:24:35.376 --> 01:24:38.397]  I was just going to check in with you.
[01:24:38.397 --> 01:24:42.619]  I work in public health at the county level.
[01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:46.120]  We're in as much of the dark as most people are.
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:51.582]  I couldn't tell you if this is the worst public health situation since the Black Plague or
[01:24:52.873 --> 01:24:55.856]  If this is just something like a common cold or something.
[01:24:55.856 --> 01:24:56.896]  Like, we're out of the loop.
[01:24:56.896 --> 01:24:58.998]  Nobody prepared for it.
[01:24:58.998 --> 01:25:08.226]  No one seems to know what they're supposed to be doing, especially at some of the municipal level that we work with.
[01:25:08.226 --> 01:25:11.729]  The state guys seem to know what's going on.
[01:25:11.729 --> 01:25:15.993]  The people that I'm working with at the Department of State Health Services.
[01:25:15.993 --> 01:25:17.414]  I haven't heard anything out of the feds.
[01:25:18.285 --> 01:25:24.268]  I haven't heard anything from our county judge or anything.
[01:25:24.268 --> 01:25:31.771]  There's a real disarray in the face of this and I don't know if it's a reflection that it's some big overwhelming problem that people don't know what to do.
[01:25:32.896 --> 01:25:35.960]  On some level, people just aren't taking it seriously or what it is.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.622]  Well, let's be rational about this.
[01:25:37.622 --> 01:25:39.945]  I mean, I've pulled the numbers up.
[01:25:39.945 --> 01:25:41.587]  Anybody can Google it.
[01:25:41.587 --> 01:25:42.448]  Just say U.S.
[01:25:42.448 --> 01:25:47.194]  deaths per year from flu, and the numbers vary from 15,000 on the low end to 35,000 in a bad flu year.
[01:25:50.939 --> 01:25:53.061]  From the CDC.
[01:25:53.061 --> 01:25:57.384]  So, we got 103 people confirmed dead in Mexico from this.
[01:25:57.384 --> 01:25:59.806]  It's now spreading in the United States.
[01:25:59.806 --> 01:26:04.751]  And if you've got hundreds and hundreds of thousands infected in Mexico, then it's no big deal.
[01:26:04.751 --> 01:26:18.002]  Now, if the media is right, and the Mexican government's telling the truth that there's only 2,000 cases, and it's killed 100 and something people out of those, this is really deadly flu with a very high mortality rate.
[01:26:20.992 --> 01:26:27.299]  I'm sorry, my phone is beeping here.
[01:26:27.299 --> 01:26:32.065]  I think it's dying, but it'll charge up here.
[01:26:32.065 --> 01:26:39.874]  You know, I don't do a lot of international work, but I have occasionally come into contact with my peers in Mexico.
[01:26:40.652 --> 01:26:50.194]  My gut feeling when I hear those numbers is those are only people that have been tracked by the official public health organizations in Mexico.
[01:26:50.194 --> 01:26:56.095]  The deaths, and even the deaths are a little bit up in the air, the hundred deaths that we're hearing thrown around.
[01:26:56.095 --> 01:27:03.156]  But just that the cases, my guess would be there are many thousands more suffering from this flu.
[01:27:03.156 --> 01:27:08.077]  Now, whether they're suffering standard flu symptoms or whether they're on the brink of death,
[01:27:09.151 --> 01:27:10.012]  I don't know.
[01:27:10.012 --> 01:27:22.563]  I do know that information is notoriously unreliable there, that there are some cultural factors there in Mexico that people do not cooperate when the survey takers come around, let alone, you know, they think they're sick.
[01:27:22.563 --> 01:27:24.024]  It's just a different country down there.
[01:27:24.024 --> 01:27:25.466]  They have a different attitude about dealing.
[01:27:25.466 --> 01:27:30.330]  You know, here people run into the hospital because they have a hangnail or something.
[01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:34.073]  CDC probably has hangnail figures that they can share with you.
[01:27:34.073 --> 01:27:35.454]  But Mexico's not that way.
[01:27:36.732 --> 01:27:37.132]  I think so.
[01:27:53.755 --> 01:28:20.269]  Yeah, I think a lot of medical experts are concerned because this thing is this transmutagenic virus that's got animal, human, but not just one animal, but lots of different human variant DNA pieces from human flu and then pig flu, swine flu, and the bird flu, and that it's killing young people mirrors the 1918 outbreak that killed 40 plus million.
[01:28:20.269 --> 01:28:20.950]  But as Dr.
[01:28:22.574 --> 01:28:32.623]  Tenpenny just said, toxic chemicals in the environment are linked to, when in the presence of just a regular flu, killing young people.
[01:28:32.623 --> 01:28:40.971]  So, I think this is opening up in the air and we're going to watch it in the next few days and just pray that it turns out to not be a big deal.
[01:28:40.971 --> 01:28:45.895]  But the huge response by government means they're either capitalizing on this to fearmonger
[01:28:46.656 --> 01:28:50.197]  Or they're fear-mongering because they don't know what's going to happen.
[01:28:50.197 --> 01:28:57.359]  Or, with this federal government's history, or other governments' history, this could be a bioweapon release.
[01:28:57.359 --> 01:29:06.802]  It could mutate, as the Associated Press doctors that they're talking to are saying, into something more deadly, as tens of thousands of people worldwide have it mutating in their bodies.
[01:29:06.802 --> 01:29:08.763]  It could mutate into something harmless.
[01:29:08.763 --> 01:29:10.864]  It'll probably mutate into lots of different variants.
[01:29:10.864 --> 01:29:11.704]  We just don't know.
[01:29:12.324 --> 01:29:27.936]  And so let's just hope and pray, this is hype, hope for the best, prepare for the worst, but again, oil of oregano, people need to get vitamin A, vitamin C, 5,000 units, people need to get lots of sleep, those are the basics.
[01:29:27.936 --> 01:29:29.497]  What health department area are you with?
[01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:30.518]  I mean, just in a general area.
[01:29:30.518 --> 01:29:32.800]  Are you in South Texas, East Texas, North Texas?
[01:29:36.528 --> 01:29:40.673]  Hey, Matt just, uh, the collar just dropped from Texas.
[01:29:40.673 --> 01:29:44.897]  Alright, we'll come back to Matt and many others on the other side of this quick break.
[01:29:44.897 --> 01:29:48.941]  We'll get a quick view from England from Paul Watson and a lot more.
[01:29:48.941 --> 01:29:51.164]  Stay with me.
[01:29:51.164 --> 01:29:52.545]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.545 --> 01:29:55.088]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.088 --> 01:29:57.791]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.663 --> 01:30:08.945]  Times are tough right now, and people are unsure about our future.
[01:30:08.945 --> 01:30:13.207]  The economy is hurting, even though there are powers that would make us believe differently.
[01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:16.309]  Banks are failing, and the gold buyers are buying.
[01:30:16.309 --> 01:30:22.812]  Question, with all the chemicals being put into our air, how do you use gold when you are very sick?
[01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:24.499]  We're good to go.
[01:30:56.299 --> 01:31:07.249]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.249 --> 01:31:14.236]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:31:14.801 --> 01:31:21.328]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.328 --> 01:31:23.370]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.370 --> 01:31:25.873]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:25.873 --> 01:31:36.845]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.455 --> 01:31:39.116]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.116 --> 01:31:40.978]  It's about a one world government.
[01:31:40.978 --> 01:31:47.883]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:57.731]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:57.731 --> 01:31:58.912]  The people strike back.
[01:32:00.953 --> 01:32:02.274]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.274 --> 01:32:07.857]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:07.857 --> 01:32:12.880]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:18.464]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:32:18.464 --> 01:32:23.687]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.687 --> 01:32:25.568]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:32:25.979 --> 01:32:30.781]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.781 --> 01:32:31.902]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:31.902 --> 01:32:34.663]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:34.663 --> 01:32:38.585]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.585 --> 01:32:41.787]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.787 --> 01:32:44.008]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:44.008 --> 01:32:44.948]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.948 --> 01:32:45.348]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:45.348 --> 01:32:46.269]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:32:55.086 --> 01:32:57.628]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:57.628 --> 01:33:01.570]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:11.717]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[01:33:11.717 --> 01:33:22.564]  The names and the letters, the places where you used to play.
[01:33:27.886 --> 01:33:31.908]  Let's hope this isn't an inside job.
[01:33:31.908 --> 01:33:45.894]  We're going to get a quick report from Paul Watson in the United Kingdom on an Atlantic view on this.
[01:33:45.894 --> 01:33:52.998]  And we're going to go to the phone banks at Genesis and the phone banks down here in Austin, Texas.
[01:33:54.184 --> 01:33:58.786]  Try to give each caller a minute or so so we can get to everybody.
[01:33:58.786 --> 01:34:01.447]  Coming up in an hour, Dr. Deagle's going to pop in.
[01:34:01.447 --> 01:34:09.091]  And then we've got, for a full hour, Steve Quayle, who last Monday said he was getting intel about a staged flu outbreak.
[01:34:09.091 --> 01:34:13.313]  Talk about nailing it, so... And I get confused.
[01:34:13.313 --> 01:34:14.133]  I know he talked about it.
[01:34:14.133 --> 01:34:17.655]  Was it on his show I was on the Thursday before that, or was it on Monday?
[01:34:17.655 --> 01:34:20.776]  Somebody ought to go listen to his show we did Thursday before and then Monday.
[01:34:20.776 --> 01:34:21.717]  I know he said it on one of them.
[01:34:23.476 --> 01:34:43.370]  And I've been telling you, it's in the cards for him to stage something like this, but Mexico is on the verge of collapse politically, so they, this certainly, and Mexicans brought this up before I even made the point on air, I wasn't going to say it, but people were emailing and calling, making the point from Mexico, that this lets the state kind of shut down any revolution down there.
[01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:46.252]  Everybody forgets what they're doing, they're worried about dying.
[01:34:46.252 --> 01:34:49.495]  Again, this is a way over response for a hundred people dead?
[01:34:52.884 --> 01:34:59.869]  I mean, hundreds and hundreds, and I pull up the numbers, they have over 300 deaths a day on average in Mexico from tuberculosis.
[01:34:59.869 --> 01:35:01.810]  Most of them in Mexico City.
[01:35:01.810 --> 01:35:06.213]  I mean, they've got all, people are dying of a common cold by the hundreds every day in Mexico City.
[01:35:06.213 --> 01:35:10.276]  There are 30 plus million people in there.
[01:35:10.276 --> 01:35:13.959]  Right in that valley.
[01:35:13.959 --> 01:35:18.121]  Formerly the seat of the Aztec Empire.
[01:35:18.121 --> 01:35:18.782]  Montezuma.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:23.641]  So, what's going on down there?
[01:35:23.641 --> 01:35:26.863]  You know, these plagues normally come out of Asia.
[01:35:26.863 --> 01:35:28.504]  Every major flu comes out of Asia.
[01:35:28.504 --> 01:35:31.086]  Now it's coming out of Mexico City?
[01:35:31.086 --> 01:35:35.389]  And it's a mix of flus from all over the world, animal and human?
[01:35:35.389 --> 01:35:38.511]  Coming up in just a moment, we're going to Paul.
[01:35:38.511 --> 01:35:41.032]  This is a AP headline.
[01:35:41.032 --> 01:35:43.634]  French news agency, excuse me, AFP.
[01:35:43.634 --> 01:35:46.616]  Swine flu virus may cause global pandemic, UN chief.
[01:35:46.616 --> 01:35:48.457]  So the fear-mongering is going into high gear.
[01:35:51.667 --> 01:35:57.910]  Well, let's just hope this isn't the case, but regardless, I got a bad feeling about all this.
[01:35:57.910 --> 01:36:01.211]  Is that because they're just going to use this for more of a crackdown, more of a police state?
[01:36:01.211 --> 01:36:02.332]  Shades of things to come?
[01:36:02.332 --> 01:36:10.076]  Well, then Napolitano comes out Sunday and says, oh yeah, this may go away, but another big one is coming.
[01:36:10.076 --> 01:36:10.896]  Very cryptically.
[01:36:10.896 --> 01:36:12.497]  Don't worry, it's going to happen.
[01:36:12.497 --> 01:36:14.558]  What does that mean?
[01:36:14.558 --> 01:36:16.098]  That's out of Reuters headline.
[01:36:16.098 --> 01:36:17.519]  Napolitano says U.S.
[01:36:17.519 --> 01:36:19.240]  should prepare for new flu outbreak.
[01:36:21.391 --> 01:36:23.032]  The Politico says U.S.
[01:36:23.032 --> 01:36:29.736]  should prepare for another flu outbreak soon, even if this one fizzles out.
[01:36:29.736 --> 01:36:33.539]  I did want to remind all the listeners that we need to stop procrastinating.
[01:36:33.539 --> 01:36:37.621]  Barack Obama is the tip of the New World Order spear.
[01:36:37.621 --> 01:36:40.583]  The open borders, the gun control, by the way,
[01:36:42.199 --> 01:36:49.065]  Gunners of America has reported they're trying to sign a treaty that will, and it's in the language, ban all reloading in the United States.
[01:36:49.065 --> 01:36:50.306]  That news is off the chart.
[01:36:50.306 --> 01:36:51.967]  In fact, that is in my stack.
[01:36:51.967 --> 01:36:54.790]  Remind me to cover that next hour, guys.
[01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:56.131]  I've got to write a note on that.
[01:36:56.131 --> 01:36:57.552]  Cover guns.
[01:36:57.552 --> 01:36:59.053]  Even though this is going on.
[01:36:59.053 --> 01:37:01.856]  We have got to expose Obama as working for the bankers.
[01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:04.532]  And, of course, the film is non-partisan.
[01:37:04.532 --> 01:37:15.608]  We show how Bush helped engineer the banker takeover, and how Obama's people helped write the banker takeover, and how Paulson and Geithner and all them worked together, and how it's seamless integration.
[01:37:18.342 --> 01:37:26.564]  I get these stupid emails from liberals and right-wingers going, wait a minute, your film's exposing Bush and Obama, and the banker takeover started with Bush.
[01:37:26.564 --> 01:37:30.025]  Yes, I know, that's what we say in clear English.
[01:37:30.025 --> 01:37:31.385]  That's the whole point.
[01:37:31.385 --> 01:37:32.946]  They're one group.
[01:37:32.946 --> 01:37:34.706]  They work with each other.
[01:37:34.706 --> 01:37:36.647]  It's good cop, bad cop.
[01:37:36.647 --> 01:37:38.387]  Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[01:37:38.387 --> 01:37:41.448]  We have to get past the presidents and realize they're just front men.
[01:37:42.208 --> 01:37:44.129]  That's what the whole film is about.
[01:37:44.129 --> 01:37:45.971]  That it's bipartisan.
[01:37:45.971 --> 01:37:51.614]  And if we wake people up to that, they can stop dividing us along left-right lines.
[01:37:51.614 --> 01:37:54.556]  So that's why the Obama deception needs to be seen.
[01:37:54.556 --> 01:37:55.937]  Because people have never heard this.
[01:37:55.937 --> 01:37:57.118]  They don't understand this.
[01:37:57.118 --> 01:37:58.459]  This is how it works.
[01:37:58.459 --> 01:38:00.561]  It's what the big political scientists talk about.
[01:38:00.561 --> 01:38:02.042]  It's what the documents show.
[01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:03.703]  This is how the world operates.
[01:38:03.703 --> 01:38:06.705]  And most of the public is caught up in fairy tales.
[01:38:06.705 --> 01:38:08.866]  And so that's why nothing changes.
[01:38:08.866 --> 01:38:10.888]  You expose the false reality.
[01:38:11.863 --> 01:38:21.412]  The Matrix-like bamboozle-ing that is going on, how the public's been shanghaied psychologically, you can all end.
[01:38:21.412 --> 01:38:24.534]  No longer left and right, but tyranny versus liberty.
[01:38:24.534 --> 01:38:28.238]  The people versus the social engineers, the New World Order, the eugenicist.
[01:38:28.238 --> 01:38:29.339]  That's what endgame.
[01:38:29.339 --> 01:38:32.842]  Terror Storm.
[01:38:32.842 --> 01:38:33.963]  Obama Deception.
[01:38:33.963 --> 01:38:35.164]  All those films cover it.
[01:38:36.693 --> 01:38:41.054]  If you attack someone from a left-right perspective, you energize the false paradigm.
[01:38:41.054 --> 01:38:42.635]  You put more energy into it.
[01:38:42.635 --> 01:38:47.676]  Please get the Obama Deception at Infowars.com.
[01:38:47.676 --> 01:38:49.197]  Please get it.
[01:38:49.197 --> 01:38:53.158]  Please make copies of it for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:38:53.158 --> 01:38:55.158]  Give it to people.
[01:38:55.158 --> 01:38:56.379]  Put it on AXS TV.
[01:38:56.379 --> 01:39:01.300]  You're authorized to.
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:03.201]  The DVD cover.
[01:39:03.201 --> 01:39:04.001]  You know, we had a caller
[01:39:04.943 --> 01:39:12.136]  From a university, you know, if it was young Ford Foundation funded anarchists who wear red stars on their shirts and call for Lenin and Mao to take over.
[01:39:12.136 --> 01:39:13.178]  They're not anarchists.
[01:39:13.178 --> 01:39:14.481]  Communists call themselves that now.
[01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:15.543]  Not all the anarchists.
[01:39:15.543 --> 01:39:17.446]  I mean the Foundation funded ones, let's be clear.
[01:39:18.653 --> 01:39:21.075]  People build a straw man and say I'm attacking all anarchists.
[01:39:21.075 --> 01:39:22.516]  I'm not, I'm saying those.
[01:39:22.516 --> 01:39:25.998]  You know, they can go block hallways, do whatever they want, universities left alone.
[01:39:25.998 --> 01:39:31.983]  Guys are trying, I've got other reports of this, they're trying to give out copies of the Obama Deception, universities all over, they're telling them they can't.
[01:39:31.983 --> 01:39:36.506]  The DVD cover says copy and share!
[01:39:36.506 --> 01:39:38.848]  The film cover says it!
[01:39:38.848 --> 01:39:43.331]  And I get all these emails and faxes saying send me an email, send me a fax, say I can do it.
[01:39:43.331 --> 01:39:44.632]  You got the authorization!
[01:39:47.674 --> 01:39:53.776]  But you notice, the land of the free, home of the brave, they're telling you, you preemptively have to prove that you can make copies of a film and give them out.
[01:39:53.776 --> 01:39:54.316]  Bull!
[01:39:54.316 --> 01:40:00.198]  That's not the school's purview, it's not the university's job, it's not their jurisdiction.
[01:40:00.198 --> 01:40:01.959]  You're not guilty until proven innocent.
[01:40:01.959 --> 01:40:05.060]  Tell them to go fly a kite!
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:09.822]  They are scared of the Obama deception, because it shatters their false left-right baby.
[01:40:09.822 --> 01:40:13.043]  That they're counting on to keep you in the dark.
[01:40:13.905 --> 01:40:15.786]  We can overrun these people, we can beat them.

[01:40:43.916 --> 01:40:47.157]  Tell you about one sponsor, we're going to Paul Watson and then your calls.
[01:40:47.157 --> 01:40:49.638]  Up until Deagle joins us in 40 minutes.
[01:40:49.638 --> 01:40:51.079]  No, that's more than 40 minutes.
[01:40:51.079 --> 01:40:55.261]  50 minutes.
[01:40:55.261 --> 01:40:56.641]  You know, we've had this sponsor for a while.
[01:40:56.641 --> 01:40:58.582]  It's not just the bird flu thing.
[01:40:58.582 --> 01:41:02.744]  The swine flu thing is breaking out.
[01:41:02.744 --> 01:41:09.747]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from resistant strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?
[01:41:10.891 --> 01:41:15.594]  Is there something that can kill bacteria that is safe and can be used on a daily or weekly basis?
[01:41:15.594 --> 01:41:24.200]  The new silver solution is a highly effective, potent nanoparticle, the smaller the better, and this is the tiniest, solution that is lethal to bacteria, yeast, and viruses.
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.102]  That's the good part about silver, it hits it all.
[01:41:27.102 --> 01:41:30.184]  It is non-toxic to humans and animals.
[01:41:30.184 --> 01:41:31.725]  The new silver solution is patented
[01:41:32.765 --> 01:41:34.066]  And that has been extensively tested.
[01:41:34.066 --> 01:41:35.406]  Protect yourself and your family now.
[01:41:35.406 --> 01:41:38.607]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:41:38.607 --> 01:41:41.548]  SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:41:41.548 --> 01:41:43.249]  Or visit the link on Infowars.com.
[01:41:43.249 --> 01:41:45.310]  Again, that's SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:47.651]  And it's a cocktail of things that are going to protect you.
[01:41:47.651 --> 01:41:53.793]  But the biggest thing is getting sleep and vitamin C and health and not fighting with your family.
[01:41:53.793 --> 01:41:59.115]  Studies show kids that are in homes with yelling and screaming and fighting are many more times likely to get sick
[01:41:59.858 --> 01:42:01.578]  Okay, I'm going to shut up now and go to Paul Watson.
[01:42:01.578 --> 01:42:03.439]  Paul, I'm not going to keep you.
[01:42:03.439 --> 01:42:08.080]  I know you're writing a bunch of stories and working on this right now, but the big point that Dr.
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:32.286]  Tim Penny pointed out earlier is that Tamiflu only leaves the resistant, stronger strains of the flu alive, just like antibiotics only make the strongest bacteria survive.
[01:42:32.286 --> 01:42:39.070]  And everybody's gobbling this stuff all over the world right now, so that accelerates their mutations right there alone, she was saying.
[01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:41.972]  It can mutate into something deadly, it can mutate into something that isn't a problem.
[01:42:43.232 --> 01:42:45.733]  Paul Watson, what's your gut on this?
[01:42:45.733 --> 01:42:48.774]  I always like your basic analysis.
[01:42:48.774 --> 01:42:50.554]  What's your gut on this right now?
[01:42:50.554 --> 01:42:53.735]  It's too soon to be able to be concrete in any of this.
[01:42:53.735 --> 01:42:56.075]  What's your bottom line here?
[01:42:56.075 --> 01:42:57.176]  Well, that's right Alex.
[01:42:57.176 --> 01:42:59.876]  I mean, there's a vacuum of information.
[01:42:59.876 --> 01:43:07.018]  There's a disconnect between what's happening in Mexico and what's happening in the United States.
[01:43:08.098 --> 01:43:12.940]  Um, in the fact that there have been no deaths whatsoever in the United States yet.
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:15.202]  Now they're saying 150 in Mexico.
[01:43:15.202 --> 01:43:26.287]  Um, my gut is that it's a hoax and I'm going on the fact that in 1976, something very similar happened.
[01:43:26.287 --> 01:43:31.269]  Obviously it was a different strain, but it was related to swine flu.
[01:43:31.269 --> 01:43:35.151]  We've got a story posted on prisonplanet.com from 1976.
[01:43:37.378 --> 01:43:54.657]  Where Ron Paul comments on what happened and he called it at the time quote an evil political maneuver and what happened was basically some soldiers at Fort Dix got ill and it turned out to be swine flu and this led to
[01:43:55.757 --> 01:43:58.519]  Gerald Ford at the time and Donald Rumsfeld.
[01:43:58.519 --> 01:44:09.128]  By the way, linked to their vaccines, and it wasn't really swine flu, it was some bad reaction, just like this stuff always breaks out at military bases.
[01:44:09.128 --> 01:44:10.809]  Go ahead.
[01:44:10.809 --> 01:44:22.298]  And on the back of that, Rumsfeld led the charge, along with others in that administration, to get the entire population of the United States vaccinated against swine flu.
[01:44:22.298 --> 01:44:23.319]  And it turned out that
[01:44:24.170 --> 01:44:27.151]  Of the small minority who did end up taking the vaccine.
[01:44:27.151 --> 01:44:30.092]  Hundreds were injured and 56 died.
[01:44:30.092 --> 01:44:32.713]  And Ron Paul... By the way, that's a whitewash.
[01:44:32.713 --> 01:44:37.794]  Over 500 people, the government admits, got Guillain-Barré's and autoimmune disorder from it.
[01:44:37.794 --> 01:44:38.655]  That is pure bull.
[01:44:38.655 --> 01:44:42.176]  The real number, and I've looked at the studies, was in the thousands of dead.
[01:44:42.176 --> 01:44:43.236]  But go ahead.
[01:44:43.236 --> 01:44:45.797]  But of course, the medical system that forced the shots on people
[01:44:47.125 --> 01:44:56.610]  It's going to want to cover things up, but their internal documents take on SV40 and the polio vaccine is 198 million getting a deadly cancer virus from just the first round alone.
[01:44:56.610 --> 01:44:58.311]  Go ahead.
[01:44:58.311 --> 01:44:58.671]  Right.
[01:44:58.671 --> 01:45:10.097]  So at the time, Ron Paul said, um, I predict these blatant advertising efforts to panic the people into taking swine flu shots will fail, which is largely what happened.
[01:45:10.097 --> 01:45:13.919]  And also, um, Congressman Larry McDonald at the time said, quote,
[01:45:14.418 --> 01:45:20.862]  I think the swine flu program is a tailor-made hoax that finds its roots in frightening the American people.
[01:45:20.862 --> 01:45:24.865]  And by the way, these were the patriots of their day, and they clearly killed MacDonald.
[01:45:24.865 --> 01:45:30.829]  And this shows how Ron Paul, if you see speeches of his from 30 years ago, it's like Alex Jones.
[01:45:30.829 --> 01:45:32.630]  He's gotten more mellow over the years.
[01:45:32.630 --> 01:45:35.832]  But yeah, I knew Ron Paul had exposed the swine flu.
[01:45:35.832 --> 01:45:37.093]  Start over with him and MacDonald.
[01:45:37.093 --> 01:45:39.254]  This is key.
[01:45:39.254 --> 01:45:40.275]  Yeah, MacDonald said
[01:45:41.078 --> 01:45:51.026]  Continuing, quote, I believe that a full investigation of those in charge should be launched, and if it turns out to be a dishonest promotion, everyone responsible should be removed from their jobs.
[01:45:51.026 --> 01:45:53.308]  Now, you've still got Rumsfeld there today.
[01:45:55.865 --> 01:45:59.506]  Owning Tamiflu, being the former board of director.
[01:45:59.506 --> 01:46:01.507]  Is there nothing he's not involved in?
[01:46:01.507 --> 01:46:08.509]  He's on the board of ABB as the chairman, giving nuke reactors to build bombs, on record, APBBC, to North Korea.
[01:46:08.509 --> 01:46:11.010]  He gives the chemicals and biologicals to Saddam.
[01:46:11.010 --> 01:46:13.250]  He helps create the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:20.093]  He's involved in the continutive government takeover set up with FEMA and Rex 84.
[01:46:20.093 --> 01:46:24.234]  He heads up Searle and Monsanto with the legalization of aspartame.
[01:46:24.774 --> 01:46:39.481]  And of course, Tamiflu, which is being pushed intensively over the past few days by the media and the government, when it's not, as you mentioned earlier, it's not even going to cure it if it really does mutate.
[01:46:39.481 --> 01:46:40.582]  It's owned by Gilead.
[01:46:53.103 --> 01:46:57.864]  Former Board of Directors Donald Rumsfeld, he still has a major stockholding.
[01:46:57.864 --> 01:47:10.448]  Current Board of Directors include George Shultz, Bilderberg member, and Etienne D'Avignon, Bilderberg member, and also connected is J.R.
[01:47:10.448 --> 01:47:12.908]  De Vink, Bilderberg member.
[01:47:12.908 --> 01:47:20.371]  So, these are the people that are going to be profiting wildly, no matter how bad this crisis gets.
[01:47:20.371 --> 01:47:21.831]  Then on top of that, you've got
[01:47:22.526 --> 01:47:39.275]  Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield and Byers, which is a venture capital firm that holds shares in eight top biodefense and pandemic companies, which also has a now lucrative partnership with Al Gore.
[01:47:39.275 --> 01:47:43.117]  So Al Gore is going to profit from this as well.
[01:47:43.117 --> 01:47:48.540]  And then, of course, the article we put out today, which is about Baxter International.
[01:47:49.292 --> 01:47:54.795]  It's been announced that they are working with the World Health Organization to develop a vaccine.
[01:47:54.795 --> 01:48:00.619]  Yeah, they've been chosen, the ones caught mixing live bird flu with vaccines in Europe.
[01:48:00.619 --> 01:48:01.359]  Right.
[01:48:01.359 --> 01:48:08.844]  They were caught red-handed last month shipping out the live bird virus to, uh, 18 different labs in Europe.
[01:48:08.844 --> 01:48:16.709]  And on top of that, they were involved in developing the SARS vaccine when that was a big scare four or five years ago.
[01:48:18.015 --> 01:48:24.479]  And they were given tens of millions, 33 million pounds a loan by the UK government.
[01:48:24.479 --> 01:48:34.225]  So this is the go-to company for the insiders at the World Health Organization, at the CDC, who are Eugenicist, Lock, Stock and Barrel.
[01:48:34.225 --> 01:48:35.326]  Exactly.
[01:48:35.326 --> 01:48:41.390]  And as your previous guest said, you know, as long as they've got the pretext of an emergency situation,
[01:48:42.475 --> 01:48:56.297]  Because of the changes to the law in the past few years, they've got all the cover they need in terms of liabilities for injuries and death with these vaccines, just so long as they do it under the pretext of a crisis, which is exactly how it will be.
[01:48:56.297 --> 01:49:10.920]  And they've now declared a crisis, so the military-industrial complex's 36 Level 4 bioweapons labs churning out dangerous vaccines can be forced on the public, all under the cover of the hype and fear-mongering that's going on.
[01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.529]  Exactly.
[01:49:13.529 --> 01:49:21.972]  So no matter how bad it gets, or if it fizzles out in a week or two, you know... And they're not going to hype up the deaths and injuries from all the vaccines.
[01:49:21.972 --> 01:49:25.573]  See, nobody's talking about HPV killing all these girls that are taking it.
[01:49:25.573 --> 01:49:27.054]  You know, the Gardasil.
[01:49:27.054 --> 01:49:30.035]  Nobody's talking about all the other problems coming out now.
[01:49:30.035 --> 01:49:31.335]  It's, oh, we need our vaccines.
[01:49:31.335 --> 01:49:33.076]  Look at the bird flu hype.
[01:49:33.076 --> 01:49:35.257]  Go ahead.
[01:49:35.257 --> 01:49:35.537]  Right.
[01:49:35.537 --> 01:49:41.759]  And on the subject of hysteria, which is what I see, from here in the UK,
[01:49:42.876 --> 01:49:48.878]  It's announced that there are 25, it's a quote, 25 possible swine flu cases.
[01:49:48.878 --> 01:49:50.058]  That's the headline.
[01:49:50.058 --> 01:49:57.961]  But when you actually look at the details of the 25 supposed cases, 14 have been proven negative.
[01:49:57.961 --> 01:50:01.982]  And in some cases, the people haven't even been to Mexico.
[01:50:01.982 --> 01:50:07.804]  To re-emphasize, none whatsoever have been confirmed as swine flu.
[01:50:07.804 --> 01:50:10.705]  And there's even a case of a woman in Manchester
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:22.345]  Which is about 90 minutes from where I live, who had flu symptoms, which of course are exactly the same, you know, the normal flu symptoms are exactly the same as this swine flu.
[01:50:22.345 --> 01:50:30.929]  She admitted herself to a hospital, and it turns out that she's not even been to Mexico, and she's been in the UK for the past two weeks or so.
[01:50:30.929 --> 01:50:35.531]  Well also, most people who think they get the flu have only gotten some type of cold.
[01:50:35.531 --> 01:50:36.331]  Right.
[01:50:36.331 --> 01:50:37.112]  So there are people...
[01:50:38.123 --> 01:50:40.024]  You know, the fear-mongering's taking effect.
[01:50:40.024 --> 01:50:43.105]  People who feel groggy think they're involved in this.
[01:50:43.105 --> 01:50:46.207]  And, you know, the panic is spreading faster than the actual virus.
[01:50:46.207 --> 01:50:51.889]  Yeah, it has all the earmarks of a War of the Worlds, Orson Welles fear-mongering.
[01:50:51.889 --> 01:50:53.090]  And then that's what they've said at the CDC.
[01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:55.011]  They say, well, regardless, this is good.
[01:50:55.011 --> 01:50:57.292]  Gets us ready for the real pandemic.
[01:50:57.292 --> 01:50:57.992]  Paul, stay there.
[01:50:57.992 --> 01:50:59.373]  And your call's coming up.

[01:51:57.932 --> 01:52:07.098]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.871 --> 01:52:13.756]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.756 --> 01:52:20.261]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.261 --> 01:52:22.223]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.223 --> 01:52:24.685]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:52:24.685 --> 01:52:35.574]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.859 --> 01:52:39.540]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:41.400]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:48.303]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:48.303 --> 01:52:56.566]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:56.566 --> 01:52:58.126]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:58.126 --> 01:52:59.327]  The people strike back.
[01:53:02.501 --> 01:53:03.622]  Spring is here.
[01:53:03.622 --> 01:53:04.582]  Growing season.
[01:53:04.582 --> 01:53:06.783]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:53:06.783 --> 01:53:08.503]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:53:08.503 --> 01:53:09.464]  Think about it.
[01:53:09.464 --> 01:53:13.566]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:53:13.566 --> 01:53:17.247]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:53:17.247 --> 01:53:20.088]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:53:20.088 --> 01:53:31.953]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:53:32.193 --> 01:53:32.713]  I think so.
[01:54:06.338 --> 01:54:14.624]  What you should worry about is losing your freedom.
[01:54:14.624 --> 01:54:16.865]  Not terrorists hiding in caves.
[01:54:16.865 --> 01:54:18.686]  Give up all your liberty or the terrorists will get you.
[01:54:18.686 --> 01:54:24.190]  And you find out all the anti-terrorism is for the people, the gun owners, the veterans.
[01:54:24.190 --> 01:54:26.631]  As we told you for many years.
[01:54:26.631 --> 01:54:28.312]  Now it's admitted.
[01:54:28.312 --> 01:54:30.694]  Stop being afraid of the flu.
[01:54:30.694 --> 01:54:33.636]  Don't be afraid of he who can kill your body, but he who can kill your soul.
[01:54:37.063 --> 01:54:41.226]  Let's hear this next little line.
[01:54:41.226 --> 01:54:43.648]  I was a sailor.
[01:54:43.648 --> 01:54:47.811]  I was born upon the tide.
[01:54:47.811 --> 01:54:51.634]  On the sea I did abide.
[01:54:51.634 --> 01:54:52.915]  I sailed a schooner.
[01:54:52.915 --> 01:54:58.119]  I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico.
[01:54:58.119 --> 01:55:02.743]  I went aloft to furl the mains a little blow.
[01:55:05.283 --> 01:55:09.364]  And when the yards broke off, they said that I got killed.
[01:55:09.364 --> 01:55:11.124]  And I'm livin' still.
[01:55:11.124 --> 01:55:17.385]  And I'm livin' still.
[01:55:17.385 --> 01:55:19.706]  I was a dam builder.
[01:55:19.706 --> 01:55:24.046]  Across a river deep and wide.
[01:55:24.046 --> 01:55:29.207]  Where steel and water didn't collide.
[01:55:29.207 --> 01:55:32.428]  A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.
[01:55:34.975 --> 01:55:37.597]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:55:37.597 --> 01:55:42.761]  I'm going to blitz through them right when we start the next hour.
[01:55:42.761 --> 01:55:45.563]  Tom, Nathan, Leo, Bill, Dominic, Matt, D.K.
[01:55:45.563 --> 01:55:48.224]  Wilson, Nicolette, Sherry, Dave, Carter.
[01:55:48.224 --> 01:55:48.925]  Stay with us.
[01:55:48.925 --> 01:55:49.986]  It's all coming up.
[01:56:02.492 --> 01:56:05.635]  In closing, Paul Watson joining us from Sheffield, England.
[01:56:05.635 --> 01:56:07.977]  They're talking about testing.
[01:56:07.977 --> 01:56:11.740]  They are testing all Americans and Mexicans that fly in on the flights.
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:17.825]  But the United States is not testing Mexicans and Americans coming in from Mexico.
[01:56:17.825 --> 01:56:22.769]  England and Europe and Russia are announcing banning a lot of imports from the United States.
[01:56:22.769 --> 01:56:30.315]  I mean, this is just unbelievable ninnying and fear-mongering when you look at only 103 deaths, unless they're covering that up.
[01:56:31.596 --> 01:56:35.198]  Well, the thing about it is, we're damned if we do, we're damned if we don't.
[01:56:35.198 --> 01:56:37.099]  When we posted a few articles about this on Friday,
[01:57:00.848 --> 01:57:05.051]  There were a few comments saying, oh, typical Alex Jones fear-mongering again.
[01:57:05.051 --> 01:57:08.113]  And then we come out and say that it's probably a hoax.
[01:57:08.113 --> 01:57:11.875]  And some people might say we're not taking it seriously enough.
[01:57:11.875 --> 01:57:16.779]  But you just have to look at what's known and put it in perspective.
[01:57:16.779 --> 01:57:19.140]  There's 40 cases in the US.
[01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:21.822]  Only one person's been hospitalized.
[01:57:21.822 --> 01:57:24.744]  And all the people have recovered.
[01:57:24.744 --> 01:57:30.708]  You know, there's 25 suspected cases in the UK, and none have been confirmed whatsoever.
[01:57:31.835 --> 01:57:36.378]  Around, you know, 35,000 people in a bad flu season die in the U.S.
[01:57:36.378 --> 01:57:43.463]  every year from complications related to flu viruses, and an even greater number than that die in Mexico.
[01:57:43.463 --> 01:57:58.014]  From what I've read, because if you read the actual reports closely, they will say that of the 149 deaths in Mexico, only a handful have actually been confirmed as being swine flu related.
[01:57:59.010 --> 01:58:07.978]  No, it's a horrible third world country in the big cities.
[01:58:07.978 --> 01:58:12.022]  It's very nice in smaller towns, but it's really bad in their big cities.
[01:58:12.022 --> 01:58:14.364]  Hellish is the word I would use.
[01:58:14.364 --> 01:58:17.807]  But Paul, you know, bottom line, I think
[01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:21.001]  And we'll see if we're proven wrong.
[01:58:21.001 --> 01:58:21.562]  I hope we're not.
[01:58:21.562 --> 01:58:27.345]  I think this is just fear-mongering by the Mexican government because they know they're on the verge of revolution and collapse.
[01:58:27.345 --> 01:58:33.328]  They want to grandstand as the saviors, hand out masks to everybody, have the images of the army doing that.
[01:58:33.328 --> 01:58:38.631]  I think that's all that's happening here is that Mexico has hyped this and fear-mongered this up.
[01:58:38.631 --> 01:58:39.312]  That's what I think.
[01:58:39.312 --> 01:58:42.594]  Stay there.
[01:58:42.594 --> 01:58:46.136]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.136 --> 01:58:47.997]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.052 --> 01:58:52.732]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.732 --> 01:58:57.474]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.474 --> 01:59:00.435]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.435 --> 01:59:03.475]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.475 --> 01:59:09.337]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.557 --> 01:59:12.800]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:19.806]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.806 --> 01:59:23.069]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[01:59:45.854 --> 01:59:46.996]  Take action today.
[01:59:46.996 --> 01:59:48.778]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.849 --> 01:59:56.251]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.251 --> 02:00:05.579]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.579 --> 02:00:06.880]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:08.662]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.662 --> 02:00:10.423]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.423 --> 02:00:11.984]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.984 --> 02:00:12.945]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.945 --> 02:00:17.749]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.749 --> 02:00:21.793]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:42.212]  We are live, simulcasting now for the final two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv as we track the swine-slash-bird-slash-human flu that they're now reporting has killed 140 people.
[02:00:42.212 --> 02:00:48.016]  But when you look at what regular flus do, they kill far more than that in a week in Mexico during flu season.
[02:00:48.016 --> 02:00:48.977]  Kills tens of thousands.
[02:00:50.342 --> 02:00:53.383]  So why is the media and the government hyping this so much?
[02:00:53.383 --> 02:00:55.003]  And we'll be recapping all that.
[02:00:55.003 --> 02:00:56.603]  In closing, I'm going to go to calls.
[02:00:56.603 --> 02:01:00.004]  Anything else important to add, Paul Watson?
[02:01:00.004 --> 02:01:07.786]  Yeah, there's been a couple of times where we've caught the media putting out fake stories which hype this beyond what it really is.
[02:01:07.786 --> 02:01:14.667]  For example, there was a report that when Obama went to Mexico last week,
[02:01:15.223 --> 02:01:22.108]  ...early last week that he shook hands with a archaeologist called Philippe Solis Holguin.
[02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:29.373]  And, uh, the report was that this, uh, archaeologist then died the very day after from swine flu.
[02:01:29.373 --> 02:01:31.935]  And that's why there were all these fears about Obama.
[02:01:31.935 --> 02:01:38.519]  But it turns out that's fake and that he died a week later on, uh, 23rd of April from a heart attack.
[02:01:38.519 --> 02:01:42.562]  But the big report initially was that, you know, he died from swine flu.
[02:01:42.562 --> 02:01:44.203]  It turned out to be completely fake.
[02:01:44.881 --> 02:01:48.083]  So there's a couple of things like that floating around.
[02:01:48.083 --> 02:01:50.905]  And yeah, I would agree with you at the moment.
[02:01:50.905 --> 02:01:59.129]  It looks like it's being hyped up because you've got the WHO and the UN saying, you know, it's possible there'll be a pandemic.
[02:01:59.129 --> 02:02:05.213]  And then you look at the actual numbers of how many people are getting infected and how many are making full recovery.
[02:02:05.782 --> 02:02:14.250]  You know, a third of those that were infected in Mexico have completely recovered already, according to... But, if you look at the 1918 flu, that's how it started.
[02:02:16.241 --> 02:02:40.996]  At first, so either they've released it and they know what it's going to mutate into because they've already done this in the lab, or they're not involved in a bioweapons release but they've studied it and know it's got a potential to mutate into something even more deadly that's airborne, or they're just purely hyping it to sell more vaccines and more drugs that actually cause the virus to mutate and causes more problems.
[02:02:42.057 --> 02:02:45.958]  Or it could be just Mexico hyping it for their own political purposes.
[02:02:45.958 --> 02:02:53.720]  Let's just have an article, Paul, if you can, with bullet points of what it could be and, you know, what the scenario is that we're looking at right now.
[02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:58.382]  But thank you so much, Paul Watson, at PrisonPlanet.com for your great reportage.
[02:02:58.382 --> 02:03:00.342]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:03:00.342 --> 02:03:00.822]  You bet.
[02:03:00.822 --> 02:03:04.664]  Okay, let's start going to your calls in this segment and right through quickly.
[02:03:04.664 --> 02:03:06.664]  Tom in Texas from the Genesis Phones.
[02:03:06.664 --> 02:03:07.604]  Go ahead.
[02:03:07.604 --> 02:03:08.025]  Hey, Alex.
[02:03:08.025 --> 02:03:08.965]  How are you doing today?
[02:03:08.965 --> 02:03:09.245]  Good, sir.
[02:03:10.017 --> 02:03:11.557]  This is like Twilight Zone, man.
[02:03:11.557 --> 02:03:12.538]  I'm telling you.
[02:03:12.538 --> 02:03:13.778]  A couple things.
[02:03:13.778 --> 02:03:14.898]  Watching the media.
[02:03:14.898 --> 02:03:16.799]  They're reporting 40 cases in the U.S.
[02:03:16.799 --> 02:03:17.039]  now.
[02:03:17.039 --> 02:03:19.259]  20 more cases in New York have been reported.
[02:03:19.259 --> 02:03:21.340]  That's Fox News.
[02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:23.780]  I just watch it to keep... No, that's CDC.
[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:25.601]  It says 40 in the U.S.
[02:03:25.601 --> 02:03:26.621]  Okay, and then the earthquake.
[02:03:26.621 --> 02:03:28.882]  6.0 earthquake outside of Mexico City.
[02:03:28.882 --> 02:03:30.182]  Yeah, I forgot to get to that.
[02:03:30.182 --> 02:03:31.122]  That is confirmed.
[02:03:31.122 --> 02:03:33.443]  Strong earthquake felt in Mexico City.
[02:03:33.443 --> 02:03:36.643]  Okay, the main reason I'm calling today is being a concerned parent.
[02:03:36.643 --> 02:03:38.184]  I've got three kids in public school.
[02:03:38.184 --> 02:03:38.944]  I called the school to
[02:03:39.651 --> 02:03:42.392]  I know just what their procedures were if it were to hit our area.
[02:03:42.392 --> 02:03:45.532]  I live 40 miles north of Houston.
[02:03:45.532 --> 02:03:51.654]  And, uh, the secretary, the receptionist, and all the people in the office at the school had no idea.
[02:03:51.654 --> 02:03:57.475]  They didn't, had never even heard of this swine flu, or, like I like to call it, the NWO flu.
[02:03:57.475 --> 02:04:00.676]  But, uh... But I bet they know about American Idol.
[02:04:00.676 --> 02:04:01.696]  Oh, yeah, I'm sure they do.
[02:04:01.696 --> 02:04:08.898]  But, um, once I told her about it, she went on their school network and started, um, reading reports on it.
[02:04:09.653 --> 02:04:13.836]  They're close to you in Bexar and Gonzales counties?
[02:04:13.836 --> 02:04:19.240]  She says that they are asking people to voluntarily stay in their home, not to go to public gatherings.
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:25.525]  Sort of like a voluntary quarantine going on in those counties.
[02:04:25.956 --> 02:04:28.477]  Yeah, and what this is, is great martial law training.
[02:04:28.477 --> 02:04:32.418]  Because under regular martial law, they tell you to stay in your homes.
[02:04:32.418 --> 02:04:39.420]  In fact, guys, YouTube Jello Biafra martial law song, let's play that coming back.
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:46.682]  It's like, stay in your homes, remain calm, the number one threat is freedom.
[02:04:48.134 --> 02:04:49.275]  All right, thank you so much, sir.
[02:04:49.275 --> 02:04:50.476]  I appreciate your call.
[02:04:50.476 --> 02:04:58.984]  More calls straight ahead from Nathan, Leo, Bill, Dominique, and many, many others on the other phone system when we return after this quick break.
[02:04:58.984 --> 02:05:01.827]  Love the different angles and pieces of intel that callers have.
[02:05:01.827 --> 02:05:03.648]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:05:03.648 --> 02:05:08.733]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:05:08.993 --> 02:05:10.594]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:05:10.594 --> 02:05:18.978]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:05:18.978 --> 02:05:24.801]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:05:24.801 --> 02:05:26.742]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:05:26.742 --> 02:05:29.043]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:05:29.043 --> 02:05:33.465]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:05:33.465 --> 02:05:35.486]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[02:05:35.666 --> 02:05:43.610]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:06:01.779 --> 02:06:04.340]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:06:04.969 --> 02:06:07.811]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.811 --> 02:06:13.694]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:13.694 --> 02:06:20.177]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:20.177 --> 02:06:22.158]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.158 --> 02:06:24.620]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:34.365]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[02:06:34.833 --> 02:06:37.794]  That's fascism.
[02:06:37.794 --> 02:06:39.475]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.475 --> 02:06:41.336]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:41.336 --> 02:06:48.240]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:06:56.504 --> 02:06:58.084]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:58.084 --> 02:06:59.265]  The people strike back.
[02:07:00.859 --> 02:07:05.103]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear this.
[02:07:05.103 --> 02:07:10.027]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief is?
[02:07:10.027 --> 02:07:12.589]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.
[02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:18.134]  The bailout group has settled over $100 million in credit card debt for people just like you.

[02:07:48.257 --> 02:07:49.638]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:49.638 --> 02:07:50.838]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:20.131 --> 02:08:27.707]  If you go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, you're going to see great articles, very informative about Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo, Aaron Dykes, and others.
[02:08:28.729 --> 02:08:42.033]  I'll give you the background of all of this, how they've staged flu outbreaks, how they've killed people with the vaccines, and then we're forced to stop it in 76, how this stuff always pops up on military bases.
[02:08:42.033 --> 02:08:46.214]  This has definitely got the hand of the new world order in it, and it's very serious.
[02:08:46.214 --> 02:08:48.695]  And again, it can mutate into something very, very deadly.
[02:08:49.195 --> 02:08:50.436]  Thank you Alex for taking my call.
[02:08:50.436 --> 02:08:51.157]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:09:19.497 --> 02:09:33.929]  I just want to comment really on when I was watching, uh, waiting to watch the, uh, press release for the CDC and Homeland Security release, um, uh, we were watching Fox News and pretty much like they just had a banner that said, don't worry, Baxter's making a vaccine.
[02:09:33.929 --> 02:09:37.432]  And they just kept it on the screen for like two minutes while they showed other video.
[02:09:37.432 --> 02:09:43.758]  And I'm just thinking, wow, you know, no mention of the avian flu scandal, you know, no, it's complete psych warfare.
[02:09:44.598 --> 02:10:04.476]  And then during the middle of the press release, or at the end of the press release, I'm sorry, the reporter asked the head of Homeland Security if this was related to bioterrorism, and Fox News cut the audio and went back to the reporter who was just commenting and regurgitating the same stuff that Napolitano was saying.
[02:10:04.476 --> 02:10:09.400]  And then right after that they butchered the 1976 fact saying that there was one death
[02:10:12.785 --> 02:10:14.867]  Uh, no mention of the 40 million vaccines.
[02:10:14.867 --> 02:10:19.572]  You know, it's just complete psych warfare and it makes me sick, you know?
[02:10:19.572 --> 02:10:23.936]  Well, the history, uh, if you're listening to the medical histories, thousands died.
[02:10:23.936 --> 02:10:30.683]  Officially, uh, Encyclopedia Britannica, uh, it says, uh, a couple hundred deaths.
[02:10:30.683 --> 02:10:33.386]  They are just absolutely lying if they say one death.
[02:10:33.386 --> 02:10:34.347]  I mean, everybody remembers 76.
[02:10:35.888 --> 02:10:40.711]  How they were telling the whole nation you must be vaccinated, and then all these deaths occurred, and they had to recall it.
[02:10:40.711 --> 02:11:00.044]  Just like in 2002, they ordered 14,000 first responders, that's all the medical workers, all the police, all the firemen, all the county, city, state, workers, federal, to take the shot, and the LA Times reported 99.9% said no, 4,000 said yes, and there were a bunch of deaths from those that did take it.
[02:11:00.044 --> 02:11:01.045]  So, it's just incredible.
[02:11:02.202 --> 02:11:05.084]  Can I just end on saying one thing?
[02:11:05.084 --> 02:11:18.772]  I was doing a little bit of research and I came across a copy of the Rebuilding America's Defenses and on page 60 on the bottom paragraph, or the whole paragraph talks about... It says we've got to condition the public and the media to accept the use of rice-specific bioweapons.
[02:11:18.772 --> 02:11:30.319]  Right, and it says, although it may take several decades for this process of transformation to unfold, the art of warfare on air, land, and sea will be vastly different and will include long-range missiles and perhaps the world of microbes.
[02:11:32.521 --> 02:11:33.682]  It sounds a little suspicious.
[02:11:33.682 --> 02:11:37.183]  Well, I mean, have you found the part in there about race-specific bioweapons?
[02:11:37.183 --> 02:11:38.163]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:11:38.163 --> 02:11:49.128]  There, at the bottom there, it says, uh, in advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.
[02:11:49.128 --> 02:11:50.949]  I mean, that right there says it all.
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:55.924]  And then Cheney, in other speeches to elite groups, called for its use.
[02:11:55.924 --> 02:12:03.390]  In fact, I found the Austin American-Statesman, normally a terrible newspaper, rebuked Cheney for that at the time, before he was even president.
[02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:13.317]  Hey, guys, Vice President, Freudian slip there, Google PNAC, race-specific bioweapons, or PNAC, P-N-A-C,
[02:12:18.869 --> 02:12:20.090]  Race Weapons, Dick Cheney.
[02:12:20.090 --> 02:12:25.112]  I want to show folks on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv the actual Austin American Statesman article.
[02:12:25.112 --> 02:12:27.432]  Because they won't believe a PNAC document if we show them.
[02:12:27.432 --> 02:12:32.734]  But show them a newspaper, it'll... You know, the mainstream media says it.
[02:12:32.734 --> 02:12:33.635]  Thank you so much.
[02:12:33.635 --> 02:12:35.175]  I appreciate your call, Matt.
[02:12:35.175 --> 02:12:35.956]  Great points.
[02:12:35.956 --> 02:12:36.616]  You bet.
[02:12:36.616 --> 02:12:37.176]  D.K.
[02:12:37.176 --> 02:12:38.417]  Wilson.
[02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:39.637]  You are on the air, D.K.
[02:12:39.637 --> 02:12:41.058]  Wilson, calling from Texas.
[02:12:41.058 --> 02:12:41.418]  Go ahead.
[02:12:42.023 --> 02:12:43.464]  Yeah, hello Alex.
[02:12:43.464 --> 02:12:49.406]  Yeah, I actually interviewed you at the Adolphus Hotel at the JFK Conference, at the Lancer Conference.
[02:12:49.406 --> 02:12:50.567]  Oh, cool.
[02:12:50.567 --> 02:12:51.387]  Yeah.
[02:12:51.387 --> 02:12:53.968]  I just got some news and some thoughts on this.
[02:12:53.968 --> 02:12:54.689]  Oh yeah, I remember you.
[02:12:54.689 --> 02:12:57.650]  We talked in the... You interviewed Jim Marsh, too.
[02:12:57.650 --> 02:13:02.252]  We talked in there, you know, in one of the reading areas out there in those big chairs.
[02:13:02.252 --> 02:13:02.752]  Exactly.
[02:13:02.752 --> 02:13:03.292]  Yep, yep.
[02:13:03.292 --> 02:13:04.133]  How you doing?
[02:13:04.133 --> 02:13:04.533]  Good, man.
[02:13:04.533 --> 02:13:04.973]  Good to see you.
[02:13:04.973 --> 02:13:06.754]  You're wearing a head cap.
[02:13:07.318 --> 02:13:08.559]  Yeah, Bad Dan, I sure am.
[02:13:08.559 --> 02:13:10.379]  Yep, sure was, sure am.
[02:13:10.379 --> 02:13:13.881]  Yeah, a little news for you.
[02:13:13.881 --> 02:13:23.064]  Richard Besser of the CDC just gave a press conference and said that there's no existing vaccine for this flu.
[02:13:23.064 --> 02:13:31.608]  Okay, then on MSNBC they interviewed a doctor who said to take Tamiflu and there's something else called Relaflex.
[02:13:33.212 --> 02:13:33.512]  I think?
[02:14:03.152 --> 02:14:06.393]  Yeah, that's in the San Antonio Express News.
[02:14:06.393 --> 02:14:08.734]  Guys, punch up the Google map.
[02:14:08.734 --> 02:14:16.216]  There's a live Google map that they've got that is showing accurately what the latest reported cases are.
[02:14:16.216 --> 02:14:22.698]  Now, I don't know if the government's being accurate itself, but I'm saying this map has the most up-to-date with the latest numbers.
[02:14:22.698 --> 02:14:26.759]  Let's punch that up on PrisonPlanet.tv viewer screens right now.
[02:14:26.759 --> 02:14:30.500]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.tv, folks, if you'd like to be able to
[02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:34.561]  You know, see all of this and to become a member.
[02:14:34.561 --> 02:14:38.782]  Though I have been taking these reports and posting them for free up on Infowars.com.
[02:14:38.782 --> 02:14:42.283]  Not free for us, we've got to pay for the bandwidth, hence the membership.
[02:14:42.283 --> 02:14:44.543]  But there it is, the cases.
[02:14:44.543 --> 02:14:46.344]  And zoom in on Texas.
[02:14:46.344 --> 02:14:49.784]  Let's zoom in on Texas and see how many cases it's showing.
[02:14:49.784 --> 02:14:54.626]  They're showing one in Fort Worth, one in Dallas, one in Garland.
[02:14:54.626 --> 02:14:55.306]  They're showing
[02:14:56.922 --> 02:15:18.120]  uh... a whole bunch south of san antonio one two three four five six seven eight nine so this is an up-to-date because as of saturday most the cases were north of san antonio right uh... so that you know that i live here there's awesome right there on your screen so that they've got cases as far north as new bronvilles now uh... and then out to the uh...
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:19.841]  Yes, let's see.
[02:15:19.841 --> 02:15:22.623]  Worldwide they're passing out masks at airports.
[02:15:36.354 --> 02:15:52.962]  Um, Besser said that masks will not help you at all, and he gave the thing about this little spiel about contact and sneeze, cover your mouth when you're sneezing, wash your hands, don't give those little kisses that you give other people, basically don't touch anybody.
[02:15:53.822 --> 02:16:15.704]  This is all part of training as the government saves you, it gives you the medicine, it tells you what to do, it tells you to stay in your house, and I've predicted before they release real plagues over and over again, they'll have lots of scares and beta tests, and then Napolitano at O&M Security basically says that, says, oh this is a good practice run for us to get ready, and we think very soon we're going to be hit by the big one.
[02:16:15.704 --> 02:16:16.805]  I mean, that is very chilling.
[02:16:17.668 --> 02:16:22.650]  Okay, the other medicine the doctor was talking about was called Relenza.
[02:16:22.650 --> 02:16:23.810]  Okay?
[02:16:23.810 --> 02:16:34.234]  And on that 6.0 earthquake, there was one... Remember, there was just an earthquake in Acapulco on the 13th of this month as well.
[02:16:34.234 --> 02:16:41.156]  So two weeks later, there's another 6.0 earthquake in Mexico, outside of Mexico City.
[02:16:41.156 --> 02:16:45.218]  And it looks to me like there's a lot of confusion, a lot of...
[02:16:45.798 --> 02:16:48.259]  Disparate news being spread around.
[02:16:48.259 --> 02:16:50.919]  Some people reporting that people are dying everywhere.
[02:16:50.919 --> 02:16:53.540]  People reporting that they're not dying everywhere.
[02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:55.501]  People are reporting to wear masks.
[02:16:55.501 --> 02:16:58.262]  This guy comes on television and says, don't wear masks.
[02:16:58.262 --> 02:17:07.104]  Okay, so it seems like in Mexico, everybody, if everybody remembers in 1968, the revolution started in Mexico City with the students.
[02:17:07.544 --> 02:17:11.426]  The earthquakes happened right in Mexico, right outside of Mexico City.
[02:17:11.426 --> 02:17:14.748]  Now we have this flu thing and everybody's basically home-ridden.
[02:17:14.748 --> 02:17:17.930]  And as you said, Alex, the government's failing there.
[02:17:17.930 --> 02:17:27.435]  And if there's a revolution that's going to start or some kind of mass protest, it's going to start with the students and with indigenous people kind of sweeping up behind them.
[02:17:27.435 --> 02:17:28.636]  That's on one tier.
[02:17:28.636 --> 02:17:32.638]  On another tier, it seems like there's this basic scare.
[02:17:33.138 --> 02:17:40.103]  Worldwide scare, and just like you just said, a kind of training, a build-up for something in the near future.
[02:17:52.020 --> 02:17:52.941]  Uh, yeah, man.
[02:17:52.941 --> 02:17:53.461]  It's okay.
[02:17:53.461 --> 02:17:56.103]  I write a sports blog called Sports On My Mind.
[02:17:56.103 --> 02:17:58.705]  It's sports and culture and society and stuff like that.
[02:17:58.705 --> 02:17:59.425]  No big deal, though.
[02:17:59.425 --> 02:18:00.226]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[02:18:00.226 --> 02:18:01.607]  I just wanted to report that to you, man.
[02:18:01.607 --> 02:18:02.047]  All right.
[02:18:02.047 --> 02:18:02.808]  Thank you so much.
[02:18:02.808 --> 02:18:03.528]  Good to see you again.
[02:18:03.528 --> 02:18:05.950]  Good to hear from you again.
[02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:07.391]  I want to be clear.
[02:18:07.391 --> 02:18:18.078]  A lot of things the public isn't ready to accept, but if the Secretary of Defense said it and government documents show it, and I have stuff from the 1950s with the Australian and British governments saying they had
[02:18:21.129 --> 02:18:24.651]  Tsunami weapons that were classified that could cause tsunamis.
[02:18:24.651 --> 02:18:33.717]  But in 1997, in the April issue of the Army Times newspaper, it was a daily issue, it was in April.
[02:18:33.717 --> 02:18:36.179]  I want to say April 16th.
[02:18:36.179 --> 02:18:39.541]  Google Secretary of Defense William Cohen earthquake weapons.
[02:18:39.541 --> 02:18:41.042]  Let's put the Army Times on screen.
[02:18:41.042 --> 02:18:43.084]  Let's see how good my memory is.
[02:18:43.084 --> 02:18:44.525]  April 16th.
[02:18:44.525 --> 02:18:46.926]  No, April 23rd.
[02:18:46.926 --> 02:18:47.467]  Oh, that's almost...
[02:18:48.356 --> 02:18:49.677]  Let's put that up on the screen.
[02:18:49.677 --> 02:18:50.898]  Let's see how good my memory is.
[02:18:50.898 --> 02:18:51.398]  April of 97.
[02:18:51.398 --> 02:18:51.839]  I know that.
[02:19:00.404 --> 02:19:02.185]  Let's see if I'm correct.
[02:19:02.185 --> 02:19:07.967]  Defense Link, transcript, DOD, Defense Link, Department of Defense, what is the date on that?
[02:19:07.967 --> 02:19:08.967]  April 28th!
[02:19:08.967 --> 02:19:10.828]  That's tomorrow!
[02:19:10.828 --> 02:19:12.509]  But I thought he gave the speech on the 23rd.
[02:19:12.509 --> 02:19:13.929]  Okay, well my memory fails.
[02:19:13.929 --> 02:19:14.750]  See, it's weird.
[02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:17.031]  I can't completely trust it.
[02:19:17.031 --> 02:19:19.132]  It's like it's almost always right on target.
[02:19:19.132 --> 02:19:26.955]  I remember in April, I remember exactly what he said about seismic earthquake weapons, and you can go read it at the Defense Link, army.mil.
[02:19:28.015 --> 02:19:30.260]  And that was 12 years ago.
[02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:35.631]  So, there I am giving you something 12 years old with near precision, but I got the date wrong.
[02:19:36.684 --> 02:19:37.024]  You worry.
[02:19:37.024 --> 02:19:38.324]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[02:20:03.973 --> 02:20:04.496]  Hi.
[02:20:04.496 --> 02:20:06.949]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[02:20:07.301 --> 02:20:11.845]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[02:20:11.845 --> 02:20:14.307]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[02:20:14.307 --> 02:20:17.649]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[02:20:17.649 --> 02:20:19.591]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[02:20:19.591 --> 02:20:22.373]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[02:20:22.373 --> 02:20:26.096]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[02:20:26.096 --> 02:20:30.520]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:34.263]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[02:20:34.603 --> 02:20:40.925]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[02:20:40.925 --> 02:20:43.286]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[02:20:43.286 --> 02:20:45.406]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[02:20:45.406 --> 02:20:50.048]  So go to offthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:50.048 --> 02:20:50.968]  Start now.
[02:20:50.968 --> 02:20:52.689]  Knowledge is power.
[02:20:52.689 --> 02:20:53.689]  Better take action.
[02:20:53.689 --> 02:21:01.471]  I think a storm's coming.
[02:21:01.471 --> 02:21:04.032]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:21:04.662 --> 02:21:07.288]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.288 --> 02:21:14.324]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:21.453]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:21.453 --> 02:21:23.413]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:23.413 --> 02:21:25.914]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:25.914 --> 02:21:36.919]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.489 --> 02:21:39.170]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.170 --> 02:21:41.011]  It's about a one world government.
[02:21:41.011 --> 02:21:47.936]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:22:02.228 --> 02:22:04.569]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[02:23:00.632 --> 02:23:03.854]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[02:23:03.854 --> 02:23:07.177]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[02:23:07.177 --> 02:23:10.960]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:17.544]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[02:23:17.544 --> 02:23:22.768]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[02:23:22.768 --> 02:23:29.473]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[02:23:29.855 --> 02:23:30.876]  Need something more?
[02:23:30.876 --> 02:23:34.818]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.

[02:23:51.086 --> 02:23:52.706]  That's 1-800-313-6400 for all of your self-defense needs today.
[02:23:52.706 --> 02:23:54.387]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[02:23:54.387 --> 02:23:55.127]  Use it only in
[02:24:16.343 --> 02:24:21.728]  We're good to go.
[02:24:40.111 --> 02:24:45.656]  A quick update from Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, who runs a practice down in Mexico, consults down there, medical doctor.
[02:24:45.656 --> 02:24:50.361]  One of the leading experts out there, even in mainstream media, talking about bird flu and analyzing it.
[02:24:50.361 --> 02:24:52.043]  We had her on for 45 minutes during the first hour.
[02:24:52.043 --> 02:24:54.265]  She was going to be popping in again from Mexico.
[02:24:54.265 --> 02:24:55.086]  She's in Monterey.
[02:24:57.093 --> 02:25:00.476]  First they cancelled their big medical conference that was already going on down there.
[02:25:00.476 --> 02:25:05.281]  Then they told them they, you know, basically have to be bussed out.
[02:25:05.281 --> 02:25:08.824]  If they don't take a plane today, they'll be bussed out tomorrow.
[02:25:08.824 --> 02:25:12.687]  I mean, so not only is the border wide open, they're making people go back.
[02:25:12.687 --> 02:25:15.050]  I mean, this is martial law.
[02:25:15.050 --> 02:25:17.792]  So Mexico is taking this very, very seriously.
[02:25:17.792 --> 02:25:21.195]  Why on earth, Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, would they make you leave now?
[02:25:21.195 --> 02:25:21.836]  Give us the latest.
[02:25:22.301 --> 02:25:30.928]  Well, they just, um, downstairs, they just unfolded all of the, uh, all of the conference materials and everybody that had booths and everything are packing up all their stuff.
[02:25:30.928 --> 02:25:45.219]  And they made an announcement that if anybody who could not get a plane out today, that they were, uh, they had a bus, the five hour bus ride from Monterey, and they were going to take people across the border and take them to San Antonio today.
[02:25:45.219 --> 02:25:50.904]  If, um, so, um, they, they're really serious about, about people leaving and nobody's like,
[02:25:51.243 --> 02:26:00.206]  You know, holding a gun to our heads and telling us that we have to leave, but there's such a sense of urgency amongst the Mexican officials here about getting us out of the country.
[02:26:00.206 --> 02:26:03.608]  It just makes me a little suspicious.
[02:26:03.608 --> 02:26:03.828]  Why?
[02:26:03.828 --> 02:26:04.308]  Why?
[02:26:04.308 --> 02:26:04.808]  I don't know.
[02:26:04.808 --> 02:26:09.210]  Maybe they really are going to close the borders and not let anybody back in or back out.
[02:26:09.210 --> 02:26:17.973]  So we've decided that maybe the prudent thing to do is to just go ahead and leave with everybody else, because we were going to stay here until Saturday.
[02:26:17.973 --> 02:26:19.274]  I mean, it's a beautiful place.
[02:26:19.274 --> 02:26:19.954]  We're going to enjoy.
[02:26:20.373 --> 02:26:29.461]  The vacation time, but if they're serious enough about this, that if you can't get a plane out, they're going to bus you to San Antonio, which is about a five hour drive.
[02:26:29.461 --> 02:26:33.344]  That's taking this really serious.
[02:26:33.344 --> 02:26:39.349]  Well, Dr. Tenpenny, this has been a big escalation in the last hour and a half since you were on with us.
[02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:42.671]  Other thoughts on why they're so panicked?
[02:26:42.671 --> 02:26:44.193]  You know, I'm really not sure.
[02:26:44.193 --> 02:26:49.297]  I mean, it's called a Monterey Healthcare City.
[02:26:49.833 --> 02:26:53.614]  You know, Monterey is a very large medical tourism center.
[02:26:53.614 --> 02:27:11.897]  It's one of the global places where people come to get healthcare, and that was the conference that I was here for, is for this Medical Tourism Association Conference, and they have wonderful facilities that are five-star that look every bit like the Cleveland Clinic or places in the U.S., and they are the ones that are calling the shots.
[02:27:11.897 --> 02:27:14.078]  It's not the Medical Tourism Association.
[02:27:14.078 --> 02:27:15.518]  It's not the conference.
[02:27:15.518 --> 02:27:16.918]  It's not the hotel.
[02:27:16.918 --> 02:27:19.419]  They're the ones who are making a really big deal.
[02:27:19.841 --> 02:27:20.482]  We're good to go.
[02:27:38.277 --> 02:27:40.238]  Nobody's going to be able to get a flight out today.
[02:27:40.238 --> 02:27:42.038]  Can we at least do part of the conference?
[02:27:42.038 --> 02:27:44.119]  Maybe do some of it tomorrow?
[02:27:44.119 --> 02:27:48.341]  Can we have the conference from noon to midnight and get as much of it in?
[02:27:48.341 --> 02:27:48.681]  Nope.
[02:27:48.681 --> 02:27:49.601]  It's cancelled.
[02:27:49.601 --> 02:27:50.902]  You can't be in this room.
[02:27:50.902 --> 02:27:54.303]  And now they're saying they're setting up buses for us to leave.
[02:27:54.303 --> 02:27:59.485]  And now there's been a big 6-plus magnitude earthquake in Mexico City.
[02:27:59.485 --> 02:28:02.766]  This is getting weirder and weirder.
[02:28:04.131 --> 02:28:07.452]  A strong earthquake felt in Mexico City, AP reports.
[02:28:07.452 --> 02:28:14.114]  A strong earthquake struck central Mexico on Monday, swaying tall buildings in the capital and sending office workers into the streets.
[02:28:14.114 --> 02:28:30.039]  The 6.0 magnitude quake was centered near Chilpaningo, about 130 miles southwest of Mexico City, or 50 miles, 80 kilometers from the resort of Acapulco, according to the U.S.
[02:28:30.039 --> 02:28:30.939]  Geological Survey.
[02:28:32.108 --> 02:28:35.290]  So it's just really, when it rains, it pours down there.
[02:28:35.290 --> 02:28:36.631]  I guess so, Alex.
[02:28:36.631 --> 02:28:39.653]  Well, I'm going to have to cut this short because I have to pack.
[02:28:39.653 --> 02:28:41.674]  Okay, I know you've got to leave right now.
[02:28:41.674 --> 02:28:43.855]  I'm going to put you on hold, Doctor.
[02:28:43.855 --> 02:28:47.677]  We're going to go over to San Antonio, probably spend the night there tonight.
[02:28:47.677 --> 02:28:50.199]  So, I've got the number for your producer.
[02:28:50.199 --> 02:28:52.760]  Would you like me to give you a call in tomorrow morning?
[02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:57.803]  Yes, 1130 Central, and if you can't, we'll talk to you when you get back to your home.
[02:28:57.803 --> 02:28:58.764]  Thank you so much, Doctor.
[02:28:59.318 --> 02:28:59.698]  You're welcome.
[02:28:59.698 --> 02:29:00.019]  Take care.
[02:29:00.019 --> 02:29:01.459]  Alright, we'll see you tomorrow.
[02:29:01.459 --> 02:29:02.640]  Thank you.
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:11.166]  She called us to let us know that she wouldn't be able to do the show tomorrow from Mexico, that she was going to be leaving, so I wanted you to hear that directly from her.
[02:29:11.166 --> 02:29:13.247]  Another eyewitness in Mexico.
[02:29:13.247 --> 02:29:18.371]  As all of this goes on, she's in one of the northern territories there.
[02:29:18.371 --> 02:29:19.571]  Northern states.
[02:29:19.571 --> 02:29:20.972]  I know we have a lot of phone calls.
[02:29:20.972 --> 02:29:21.733]  Those are coming up.
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:28.705]  I want to recap some of the top news and talk to Dr. Deagle, another medical doctor, get his other perspective.
[02:29:28.705 --> 02:29:32.508]  You know, you kind of heard from Tim Penney that this could be really bad, but probably isn't.
[02:29:32.508 --> 02:29:34.309]  We'll see what Dr. D has to say.
[02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:41.596]  And then we've got Steve Quayle coming up on the show, and that should also be informative.
[02:29:41.596 --> 02:29:43.277]  Different angles, different thoughts.
[02:29:43.277 --> 02:29:46.500]  Your calls, my analysis, Paul Watson's take.
[02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:48.622]  All of us together, breaking this down.
[02:29:48.622 --> 02:29:50.263]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:50.263 --> 02:29:51.464]  InfoWars.com is the site.
[02:29:51.564 --> 02:29:55.497]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.497 --> 02:29:58.186]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.443 --> 02:30:08.649]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:30:08.649 --> 02:30:13.193]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[02:30:53.470 --> 02:30:57.651]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:07.979 --> 02:31:13.863]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:13.863 --> 02:31:20.287]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.287 --> 02:31:22.328]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.328 --> 02:31:24.789]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:31:24.789 --> 02:31:35.676]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:37.961 --> 02:31:39.641]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.641 --> 02:31:41.502]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:41.502 --> 02:31:48.404]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:32:01.408 --> 02:32:04.851]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:32:04.851 --> 02:32:09.114]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:32:09.114 --> 02:32:20.783]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:32:20.783 --> 02:32:26.607]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:32:26.847 --> 02:32:27.487]  We're good to go.
[02:32:48.114 --> 02:32:55.319]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com, that's U-T-O-P-I-A silver dot com, or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338, and help us win this battle!
[02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:09.664]  What would you do if you Knew all the things we knew?
[02:33:09.664 --> 02:33:11.745]  Would you stand up for truth?
[02:33:11.745 --> 02:33:15.028]  Or would you turn away too?
[02:33:15.028 --> 02:33:19.791]  And then what if you saw All of the things that's wrong?
[02:33:19.791 --> 02:33:22.353]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[02:33:22.353 --> 02:33:25.396]  Or would you turn and walk away?
[02:33:25.396 --> 02:33:30.539]  What would you do if you Knew all the things we knew?
[02:33:30.539 --> 02:33:32.441]  Would you stand up for truth?
[02:33:42.816 --> 02:33:48.400]  I see a message from the government like every day.
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:51.242]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[02:33:51.242 --> 02:33:53.564]  They wanted me about Osama or whatever.
[02:33:53.564 --> 02:33:55.265]  Picture me buying this scam.
[02:33:55.265 --> 02:33:56.486]  I said never.
[02:33:56.486 --> 02:33:59.148]  You in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting.
[02:33:59.148 --> 02:34:01.770]  I stay committed, give up, either die or lose commission.
[02:34:01.770 --> 02:34:04.212]  It's all a part of fighting devil state mind control.
[02:34:04.212 --> 02:34:04.692]  And all about
[02:34:04.952 --> 02:34:05.652]  We're good to go.
[02:34:35.814 --> 02:34:42.618]  Alright, we've got Dr. D. going on for about 10 minutes, and then I'm going to just bam, bam, bam, go through your calls.
[02:34:42.618 --> 02:34:44.079]  Then Steve Quayle is coming up.
[02:34:44.079 --> 02:34:47.121]  I'm going to have Dr. D. back up throughout the week.
[02:34:47.121 --> 02:34:48.942]  He's the Genesis Talk Show host here.
[02:34:48.942 --> 02:34:51.504]  Nutramedical.com is the website.
[02:34:51.504 --> 02:34:52.324]  Another medical doctor.
[02:34:52.324 --> 02:34:53.465]  We'll give you his bio in a moment.
[02:34:53.465 --> 02:35:01.670]  Before we go any further, I want to encourage you to continue to support us, but also get materials that are great for waking other people up in your area.
[02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:04.172]  Namely, namely,

[02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:32.391]  Look at this.

[02:35:37.498 --> 02:35:40.620]  We've got the Socialism shirt with a gun to the hip.
[02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:42.581]  Click on the Live Free or Die one.
[02:35:42.581 --> 02:35:45.023]  That's the design on the front and the back of BigInfoWars.com.
[02:35:45.996 --> 02:35:47.176]  A Minuteman.
[02:35:47.176 --> 02:35:50.177]  Click on the Minuteman himself and it will enlarge it.
[02:35:50.177 --> 02:35:50.977]  There you go.
[02:35:50.977 --> 02:35:52.918]  Live Free or Die.
[02:35:52.918 --> 02:35:55.398]  That is our best-selling shirt right now.
[02:35:55.398 --> 02:36:01.560]  And you can also show folks the Obama shirt, that white one down there.
[02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:03.721]  New World Order with the Obama symbol.
[02:36:03.721 --> 02:36:04.641]  Great way, folks.
[02:36:04.641 --> 02:36:05.761]  It's not an offensive shirt.
[02:36:05.761 --> 02:36:07.482]  People say, what does that mean?
[02:36:07.482 --> 02:36:08.842]  And you can explain it to them.
[02:36:10.051 --> 02:36:12.912]  So again, please go to InfoWars.com and get the t-shirts.
[02:36:12.912 --> 02:36:17.293]  It's a great way to meet like-minded people when you go to these tea parties or in the Fed rallies.
[02:36:17.293 --> 02:36:21.194]  But not just there, to church or school or the coffee shop or the grocery store.
[02:36:21.194 --> 02:36:23.655]  You want to meet like-minded people, this is the way to do it.
[02:36:23.655 --> 02:36:25.695]  All at InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:36:25.695 --> 02:36:25.735]  888-253-3139.
[02:36:33.055 --> 02:36:34.035]  Really in-depth stuff.
[02:36:34.035 --> 02:36:35.796]  It's probably going to be shocking to hear.
[02:36:35.796 --> 02:36:36.696]  I haven't talked to Steve.
[02:36:36.696 --> 02:36:37.656]  We just called him this morning.
[02:36:37.656 --> 02:36:41.738]  My producer said, call Steve, let's get him on.
[02:36:41.738 --> 02:36:49.580]  I don't know what his view on this bird flu situation, swine flu, slash human flu, transgenic, mutagen, or whatever it is.
[02:36:50.185 --> 02:36:51.106]  So that's coming up again.
[02:36:51.106 --> 02:36:57.032]  I want to hear Dr. Dee's take on it as well now that I talked to him last night, but a lot's happened since we had him on at like 530 Central.
[02:36:57.032 --> 02:37:03.218]  Before we go any further though, my solar backup, a lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[02:37:03.218 --> 02:37:06.000]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[02:37:06.741 --> 02:37:07.342]  We're good to go.
[02:37:23.197 --> 02:37:24.418]  It generates free electricity.
[02:37:24.418 --> 02:37:26.639]  Remember, too, that gas stations need gas.
[02:37:26.639 --> 02:37:30.461]  But in the blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[02:37:30.461 --> 02:37:33.882]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[02:37:33.882 --> 02:37:35.983]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[02:37:35.983 --> 02:37:38.265]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks.
[02:37:38.265 --> 02:37:39.805]  So make your move now.
[02:37:39.805 --> 02:37:41.046]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:37:41.046 --> 02:37:42.107]  That's My Solar Backup.
[02:37:42.107 --> 02:37:42.747]  One word.
[02:37:42.747 --> 02:37:44.268]  MySolarBackup.com or give them a call.
[02:37:44.268 --> 02:37:44.328]  877-327-0365.
[02:37:44.328 --> 02:37:44.668]  877-327-0365.
[02:37:44.668 --> 02:37:46.689]  And one more sponsor I wanted to tell you about.
[02:37:53.922 --> 02:38:00.030]  that is making this radio show possible are the fine folks at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:38:00.030 --> 02:38:03.374]  Clean, healthy, non-GMO, non-hybrid food.
[02:38:03.374 --> 02:38:04.476]  The lowest prices out there.
[02:38:04.476 --> 02:38:07.900]  These are the biggest storable foods companies in the nation, so they pass those savings on to you.
[02:38:09.125 --> 02:38:14.347]  And just a fabulous high-quality food from Utah, the folks that wrote the book on this.
[02:38:14.347 --> 02:38:30.474]  efoodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, or 800-409-5633, with all the things the New World Order is doing, with the history of criminality of the global elite, and the things they do, and the fact that they don't want you to have storable food or drink.
[02:38:30.894 --> 02:38:32.874]  Filtered water or own firearms.
[02:38:32.874 --> 02:38:34.115]  They want you dependent.
[02:38:34.115 --> 02:38:35.775]  They want you broke back.
[02:38:35.775 --> 02:38:41.976]  A great way to be self-sufficient is to get high-quality food at efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:38:41.976 --> 02:38:46.117]  800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:38:46.117 --> 02:38:55.219]  Okay, I really want to hear, now that he's had more time to look at this, because nobody talks and writes about bird flu more than Dr. Deagle, who is a medical doctor.
[02:38:55.859 --> 02:38:59.421]  And if you go over his bio, it is lengthy.
[02:38:59.421 --> 02:39:04.804]  I think it's probably better, Dr. Deagle, plus I just had your bio here in front of me.
[02:39:04.804 --> 02:39:06.765]  There's so much going on.
[02:39:06.765 --> 02:39:12.568]  If you tell the listeners a little bit about yourself, because you particularly worked in a lot of these areas.
[02:39:12.568 --> 02:39:12.808]  In fact,
[02:39:14.056 --> 02:39:19.560]  I had known this, I'd heard it from another doctor, it was actually a biologist, but I didn't believe it.
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:21.601]  I believed him, but I just couldn't believe it.
[02:39:21.601 --> 02:39:26.104]  And then you were on the show about a year ago and you said, yeah, look at how they make aspartame.
[02:39:26.104 --> 02:39:37.232]  It is a specially engineered bacteria's excrement, is what aspartame is, and they feed toxic chemicals to the bacteria, the E. coli.
[02:39:38.959 --> 02:39:52.048]  And then it, so they feed a crap-eating bacteria, chemicals, and then it defecates out, I hate to talk about this, this is what the New World Order is into, a toxic chemical.
[02:39:52.048 --> 02:39:56.171]  And so this is a by-law, and I'd heard this and read this and didn't believe it.
[02:39:56.171 --> 02:39:57.953]  Then I googled that day a year ago,
[02:39:59.588 --> 02:40:01.490]  Aspartame manufacturing process.
[02:40:01.490 --> 02:40:02.190]  Do that right now.
[02:40:02.190 --> 02:40:03.612]  This is a side issue.
[02:40:03.612 --> 02:40:11.018]  And it was exactly, with photos and videos, what Deagle said he saw 20 years ago at a factory when he was getting a tour of a vaccine facility.
[02:40:11.018 --> 02:40:11.839]  I think he said he worked there.
[02:40:11.839 --> 02:40:12.839]  I forget.
[02:40:12.839 --> 02:40:18.304]  And separate from the vaccine facility, on another back 40, was their huge aspartame facility.
[02:40:18.304 --> 02:40:20.746]  And it was black sludge.
[02:40:20.746 --> 02:40:23.188]  Well, folks, you can go online and look at the black sludge.
[02:40:23.188 --> 02:40:24.850]  Just give an example of how crazy it is.
[02:40:25.427 --> 02:40:30.510]  Since 1981 when they approved this, you are eating E. coli crap.
[02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:32.011]  That is aspartame.
[02:40:32.011 --> 02:40:33.912]  Now in over 10,000 products.
[02:40:33.912 --> 02:40:37.534]  Dr. D., you want to tell folks briefly about that and then your bio?
[02:40:37.534 --> 02:40:40.216]  Yeah, I'll try to be the bio real brief.
[02:40:40.216 --> 02:40:49.561]  My background before I went into medicine in the 70s was I was trained in infectious disease and worked under a bio-weaponer, Dr. Robert Brown.
[02:40:49.561 --> 02:40:49.961]  In the 1997,
[02:40:53.861 --> 02:41:02.146]  I spoke at Human Life International in Zurich, Switzerland on the Super Soldier program, which they tried to recruit me at UCLA in 1978.
[02:41:02.146 --> 02:41:04.508]  I turned them down.
[02:41:04.508 --> 02:41:13.534]  And I also spoke against fetal tissue transplantation, which was projects going on all across America, from Boulder to U of Texas, etc.
[02:41:13.534 --> 02:41:19.938]  And after my talk, they gave me, plunked down in front of me, a foot of documents about three projects.
[02:41:19.938 --> 02:41:21.939]  The first two projects were the plasmid
[02:41:22.863 --> 02:41:33.728]  Genetically engineered tetanus vaccine was to create antibodies to cause first trimester abortions, primarily to reduce the population by causing a spontaneous miscarriage in women.
[02:41:33.728 --> 02:41:43.312]  The second project was a special virus project, which they also tried to recruit me in 1974 to go to Uganda for the CIA and finish my PhD in virology.
[02:41:43.312 --> 02:41:44.592]  I turned them down.
[02:41:44.592 --> 02:41:48.574]  This project was a mycobacteria, which is carrying an RNA retrovirus.
[02:41:48.574 --> 02:41:50.455]  The virus is, in fact, genetically
[02:41:51.015 --> 02:41:51.195]  I think?
[02:42:08.044 --> 02:42:09.185]  CDC, etc.
[02:42:09.185 --> 02:42:11.627]  But the most scary project... Let me just stop you for a moment.
[02:42:11.627 --> 02:42:26.400]  For those that don't know, and this sounds ridiculous, I'm trying to recruit him, that's who the CIA recruits is doctors, is scientists, because these are professionals that have proven they can follow orders and carry out complex procedures.
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:34.207]  My dad is a dentist and oral surgeon, and they tried to recruit him and a bunch of other Dallas top-of-their-class oral surgeons
[02:42:35.219 --> 02:42:38.520]  To be part of a, and we were going to have to move to Maryland in my day, it was double the money.
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:39.140]  He said, no.
[02:42:39.140 --> 02:42:48.543]  I remember the conversations around the table when I was like 10 years old and they came back a year later and all he would tell them is it was cybernetics because he knew how to implant things in bone.
[02:42:48.543 --> 02:42:56.385]  So for those that don't know, the military industrial complex hits up what I would say, what, probably a third of your specialized doctors and people?
[02:42:56.385 --> 02:42:57.165]  Uh, yeah.
[02:42:57.165 --> 02:42:59.946]  They look for people that have a bent toward doing research.
[02:42:59.946 --> 02:43:02.747]  A lot of doctors, only maybe 5% really like to do research.
[02:43:03.254 --> 02:43:08.096]  The rest of them just want to go off and do procedures and have a practice.
[02:43:08.096 --> 02:43:10.077]  My whole point is this is widespread.
[02:43:10.077 --> 02:43:11.417]  Oh yeah, this is standard.
[02:43:11.417 --> 02:43:13.238]  This is not an unusual thing.
[02:43:13.238 --> 02:43:15.419]  This is standard to call through.
[02:43:15.419 --> 02:43:20.561]  And just like the Rhodes Scholarship, they put 300 Rhodes Scholars through every year.
[02:43:20.561 --> 02:43:24.022]  10% when they do their psychological testing are a little bit psychotic.
[02:43:24.022 --> 02:43:25.323]  They're kind of strange.
[02:43:25.323 --> 02:43:27.364]  They'll do things no matter what.
[02:43:27.364 --> 02:43:28.784]  And they get a carte blanche.
[02:43:28.784 --> 02:43:30.525]  Now the third project was the most scary of all.
[02:43:30.525 --> 02:43:32.926]  And this was a project where they told me all the details.
[02:43:33.510 --> 02:43:33.870]  We're good to go.
[02:43:57.509 --> 02:43:59.891]  And it therefore had pig flu and human flu.
[02:43:59.891 --> 02:44:04.395]  And I went over the genetics letter by DNA letter with Dr. Henry L. Nyman three years ago.
[02:44:04.395 --> 02:44:10.299]  And by the way, they now admit that they have, with the Human Genome Project, rebuilt that flu.
[02:44:10.299 --> 02:44:18.206]  And I remember 12, 13 years ago, when this was first breaking in the late 90s, that it was rumored they were going to rebuild it.
[02:44:18.206 --> 02:44:20.748]  Now they admit they have, but quote, for research.
[02:44:20.748 --> 02:44:21.028]  Yeah.
[02:44:21.028 --> 02:44:23.090]  And they actually, these are all in public documents now.
[02:44:23.090 --> 02:44:24.070]  I had it 1997, March 6th.
[02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:27.113]  It was given to me by these scientists and doctors.
[02:44:27.637 --> 02:44:30.099]  Who smuggled the documents out of the World Health Organization.
[02:44:30.099 --> 02:44:36.825]  They were going to take this and then they were going to add avian genes and insert it into the bird population in Asia.
[02:44:36.825 --> 02:44:44.671]  And then they were going to later, quote, cause the release of bridging viruses that will allow it to jump into humans and other animals.
[02:44:44.671 --> 02:44:45.652]  That's just happened.
[02:44:45.652 --> 02:44:47.874]  Now whether this wave is the big one, I don't know.
[02:44:47.874 --> 02:44:52.798]  But I can tell you what Napolitano is telling us, that watch out for the next wave.
[02:44:53.319 --> 02:44:55.180]  There's almost certainly at least two substrains.
[02:44:55.180 --> 02:44:56.841]  The one in America is not very lethal.
[02:44:56.841 --> 02:44:59.043]  It's like a bad flu.
[02:44:59.043 --> 02:45:07.068]  But the one in Mexico City, if there's hundreds dead, or even a hundred dead out of, say, two thousand, that's a pretty high lethality rate.
[02:45:07.068 --> 02:45:10.771]  Is that because it's been there longer and mutated into a worse?
[02:45:10.771 --> 02:45:11.912]  Well, it could be several reasons.
[02:45:11.912 --> 02:45:14.834]  Or is it because they're sick down there and aren't healthy?
[02:45:14.834 --> 02:45:19.897]  Well, when you're unhealthy, you see, you have more free radicals in your body, or if you're exposed to toxins, like Dr. Tenpenny said,
[02:45:20.433 --> 02:45:29.180]  If you want to take a virus and you want to make that virus mutate and become more aggressive, you can insert it into an animal and actually inject the animal with toxins or poisons.
[02:45:29.180 --> 02:45:33.704]  And it'll actually make that virus more aggressive and it'll make it mutate faster.
[02:45:33.704 --> 02:45:38.187]  So, uh, what's probably happening is a simple process of recombination.
[02:45:38.187 --> 02:45:42.411]  We know that they inserted the H5N1 in their specific genes.
[02:45:42.411 --> 02:45:48.916]  So when the genetics come out, there's a gene deletion on the PB2 gene that makes a completely bypassed interleukin-4 in all mammals.
[02:45:49.332 --> 02:45:50.833]  So there's no warning system at all.
[02:45:50.833 --> 02:45:52.154]  It's even worse than in 1918.
[02:45:52.154 --> 02:45:57.036]  So it gets through the defenses of the body, and I want you to get back into that in the time before Steve Quill comes up.
[02:45:57.036 --> 02:46:13.025]  But the key here is, every doctor I've talked to on and off air is saying, and they'll especially say off air, on air they say it's suspicious, off air they say, no way the way this virus is set up with pig, human, and bird, this thing is designer.
[02:46:13.365 --> 02:46:23.510]  Yeah, I can visualize in my mind that they had a lab truck spraying it around Mexico City or the favelas around it, the slums, where you have sickened and weak populations.
[02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:28.092]  But the fact is that now the bird populations in all continents now have these lethal genes.
[02:46:28.092 --> 02:46:32.374]  It's going to bridge from birds, say, to cattle, humans, pigs, God knows what.
[02:46:32.374 --> 02:46:33.994]  And this is the first of many waves.
[02:46:33.994 --> 02:46:38.416]  In the steamship age, it took months for the next wave to happen.
[02:46:38.416 --> 02:46:41.578]  My grandmother lost a brother and a sister, and the little sister died.
[02:46:42.310 --> 02:46:42.550]  I think?
[02:47:00.455 --> 02:47:04.239]  With these documents I was given 12 years ago to warn people.
[02:47:04.239 --> 02:47:12.527]  When they keep telling you there's going to be an avian flu pandemic, and a lot of doctors didn't believe it, I had the inside documents, I had the genetics, I had the background infectious disease.
[02:47:12.527 --> 02:47:14.749]  They were doing everything they can to create it.
[02:47:14.749 --> 02:47:16.691]  It wouldn't happen spontaneously.
[02:47:16.691 --> 02:47:25.119]  They now have released the bridging virus, which is this new super hybrid, and future waves, if this is not the big one, are going to come and they're going to come quickly.
[02:47:26.795 --> 02:47:32.001]  Now, normally they say a virus peaks in about 90 days, but I mean, they all vary.
[02:47:32.001 --> 02:47:33.363]  It all depends on the genetics.
[02:47:33.363 --> 02:47:34.484]  This is going to recombine.
[02:47:34.484 --> 02:47:35.825]  It's this strain.
[02:47:35.825 --> 02:47:37.748]  The one in America seems to be relatively mild.
[02:47:37.748 --> 02:47:38.729]  We don't have anybody dead.
[02:47:38.729 --> 02:47:39.650]  But in Mexico City...
[02:47:40.191 --> 02:47:43.872]  And as it changes and recombines, it can recombine very quickly.
[02:47:43.872 --> 02:47:46.093]  But how do we know that it's not the same virus?
[02:47:46.093 --> 02:47:48.514]  It's just that they're... We don't know because they won't release the data.
[02:47:48.514 --> 02:47:49.375]  They never release the data.
[02:47:49.375 --> 02:47:50.835]  Well, they are acting very secretive.
[02:47:50.835 --> 02:47:56.698]  And I've had call after call on and off air from Mexico where they say 70% of the people they know are sick.
[02:47:56.698 --> 02:48:01.580]  You go to the hospital, people are vomiting everywhere, blood coming out their noses.
[02:48:01.580 --> 02:48:03.200]  And this is similar to what we saw in 1918.
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:03.580]  Right.
[02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:06.421]  It causes a hemorrhagic diathesis.
[02:48:06.421 --> 02:48:07.642]  It causes a cytokine storm.
[02:48:08.134 --> 02:48:11.757]  And if it's bad enough, the stronger your immune system, the more deadly it is.
[02:48:11.757 --> 02:48:14.639]  So, that's why people need to pay attention.
[02:48:14.639 --> 02:48:16.901]  It's not just how bad this is now.
[02:48:16.901 --> 02:48:19.983]  It's that the virus is then going to get into other animals.
[02:48:19.983 --> 02:48:22.425]  Dogs, cats, birds.
[02:48:22.425 --> 02:48:30.712]  And as it recombines there, because it has the receptor binding domain to get back to humans, we now have a returning vector system where it can get into cattle.
[02:48:30.712 --> 02:48:32.713]  It can get into people's pets.
[02:48:32.713 --> 02:48:37.457]  We already have a pandemic where birds all over the world... I have reports from game wardens in British Columbia.
[02:48:38.260 --> 02:48:40.261]  Um, from Washington State, from Oregon.
[02:48:40.261 --> 02:48:42.122]  Pigs are dying all over the United States.
[02:48:42.122 --> 02:48:42.842]  Exactly.
[02:48:42.842 --> 02:48:44.682]  That's in the mainstream news.
[02:48:44.682 --> 02:49:04.450]  Right, so now we have the proof that there is a pandemic in birds, there's now a pandemic in pigs, and the likelihood is that when this recombines in future waves, and they've done this because their plan is, and they were told me this in these documents, these physicians gave me these documents, said this is to reduce the world population by at least 2 billion.
[02:49:04.450 --> 02:49:04.670]  Okay?
[02:49:05.111 --> 02:49:06.652]  They are doing everything.
[02:49:06.652 --> 02:49:07.932]  They're behind schedule.
[02:49:07.932 --> 02:49:09.133]  All of the public documents.
[02:49:09.133 --> 02:49:17.376]  And they use their staged terror attacks of 9-11 to put the control grid in, to tell you it's for brown-skinned guys in caves.
[02:49:17.376 --> 02:49:21.258]  And now they admit, oh, this Homeland Security is for you, the gun owners.
[02:49:21.258 --> 02:49:23.498]  You're the number one threat to veterans.
[02:49:23.498 --> 02:49:28.120]  So they need us to be straightjacketed and to be listed as the enemies.
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:31.402]  So when they move with a mass plague, we stand down.
[02:49:31.402 --> 02:49:31.902]  Exactly.
[02:49:31.902 --> 02:49:34.763]  And their whole idea is the statement by
[02:49:35.330 --> 02:49:35.850]  I don't think so.
[02:50:04.986 --> 02:50:08.127]  Vaccines will be useless, this will continue to mutate and change.
[02:50:08.127 --> 02:50:13.830]  The only thing is self-quarantine at home, and of course a whole series of nutraceuticals, and they can check with me on that.
[02:50:13.830 --> 02:50:15.610]  But there are things that'll block it.
[02:50:15.610 --> 02:50:24.914]  The government could have installed a system called Aeroclave, which was developed with Homeland Security, but they haven't done it to actually cure all aircraft.
[02:50:24.914 --> 02:50:28.415]  They could have had a biohazard center for disease control.
[02:50:28.415 --> 02:50:29.316]  Do masks help?
[02:50:29.316 --> 02:50:31.216]  Yes, you need a nanomask.
[02:50:31.216 --> 02:50:32.397]  You need a nanoparticle mask.
[02:50:33.078 --> 02:50:36.341]  Regular droplet masks that the doctors and nurses have won't do anything.
[02:50:36.341 --> 02:50:39.264]  That's why it didn't stop the coronavirus or SARS.
[02:50:39.264 --> 02:50:48.031]  This is going to be a really big mess, because the doctors are not trained how to do infectious control properly, and they will have casualties.
[02:50:48.031 --> 02:50:49.913]  But even a regular mask reduces some.
[02:50:49.913 --> 02:50:51.955]  I mean, it'll block a larger... A little bit.
[02:50:51.955 --> 02:50:56.239]  I mean, because the virus will be within a... Yeah, exactly.
[02:50:56.239 --> 02:50:59.021]  It's going to block some, but you want to have... Thank you, Dr. Diegel.
[02:50:59.021 --> 02:50:59.942]  We'll talk to you again tomorrow.
[02:51:01.394 --> 02:51:03.577]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[02:51:03.577 --> 02:51:10.707]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[02:51:10.707 --> 02:51:16.556]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anywhere.
[02:51:16.676 --> 02:51:17.577]  Even underground.
[02:51:17.577 --> 02:51:30.011]  For 100 years, the Heirloom Garden Seed Time Capsule can withstand 3 tons of weight, is 100% rodent-proof, waterproof, and comes with a whopping 6,000 healthy vegetable seeds from 20 varieties that will grow anywhere in the USA.
[02:51:30.011 --> 02:51:31.252]  Unless you trust the government.
[02:51:31.252 --> 02:51:36.558]  The Heirloom Garden Seed Time Capsule and Heirloom Seeds from survivalistseeds.com is your long-term food solution.
[02:51:36.578 --> 02:51:38.119]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[02:52:05.069 --> 02:52:07.694]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.694 --> 02:52:14.728]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.279 --> 02:52:21.804]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.804 --> 02:52:23.846]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.846 --> 02:52:26.348]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.348 --> 02:52:37.317]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.917 --> 02:52:39.578]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.578 --> 02:52:41.439]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:41.439 --> 02:52:48.363]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:53:01.235 --> 02:53:02.916]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:53:02.916 --> 02:53:04.677]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:53:04.677 --> 02:53:07.339]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:53:07.339 --> 02:53:12.482]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:53:12.482 --> 02:53:15.684]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[02:54:15.014 --> 02:54:16.756]  Remember this folder from a few weeks ago?
[02:54:16.756 --> 02:54:25.003]  Mass Graves.
[02:54:25.003 --> 02:54:28.547]  We'll talk about this with Steve Quayle coming up in the next hour.
[02:54:29.994 --> 02:54:33.495]  You know, you're not going to hear a full-spectrum analysis from every angle, every view.
[02:54:33.495 --> 02:54:36.796]  We're really getting a truly diverse analysis.
[02:54:36.796 --> 02:54:38.557]  You're not going to hear that on mainstream news.
[02:54:38.557 --> 02:54:39.557]  They're just dumbing it down.
[02:54:39.557 --> 02:54:41.778]  Trying to fearmonger.
[02:54:41.778 --> 02:54:49.221]  Tell you a bunch of Tamiflu is going to save you when all it does is accelerate the mutations of the virus to a more deadly strain.
[02:54:49.221 --> 02:54:50.821]  So I would ask everybody to keep spreading the word.
[02:54:50.821 --> 02:54:55.183]  If you're listening to us on AM and FM right now, tell people at Red Lights, hey, tune into this station.
[02:54:56.107 --> 02:54:56.848]  Or on the internet.
[02:54:56.848 --> 02:55:00.450]  Tell your friends and family, tune in on the free streams at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:00.450 --> 02:55:08.496]  If you want to hear any of what we've just covered in the last two hours, fifty-five minutes, the whole four-hour show will be posted a little bit after the show today at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:08.496 --> 02:55:10.858]  You click on the listen button, it takes you to the listen page.
[02:55:10.858 --> 02:55:12.239]  There's the free podcast.
[02:55:12.239 --> 02:55:17.303]  Just copy that little bit of code, that link into your MP3, iPod device, whatever.
[02:55:17.303 --> 02:55:19.084]  Folks are putting these all over the web, posting everywhere.
[02:55:19.084 --> 02:55:24.909]  We appreciate that on the BitTorrents, because we're really, you know,
[02:55:26.056 --> 02:55:30.197]  Not fear-mongering one-tenth of the mainstream media.
[02:55:30.197 --> 02:55:32.737]  I mean, this is scary by the very nature of reporting it.
[02:55:32.737 --> 02:55:37.818]  It conjures up scary fears because the flu has killed hundreds of millions of people in the last century.
[02:55:37.818 --> 02:55:40.859]  Forty million of those just in one year in 1918.
[02:55:40.859 --> 02:55:44.480]  And we know the globalists are a bunch of eugenicists and are very, very dangerous and have a history of this.
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:45.380]  So we've got to watch them.
[02:55:45.380 --> 02:55:53.762]  We know they've been gearing up for martial law and global takeover and to bring in the North American Union out of a flu or smallpox outbreak.
[02:55:53.762 --> 02:55:55.022]  So there's a lot going on here.
[02:55:58.806 --> 02:56:03.510]  But we're trying to get people to be calm and to not mind all the hype.
[02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:05.432]  It looks like this is all just hype.
[02:56:05.432 --> 02:56:08.454]  But if it does mutate into something, Katie, bar the door.
[02:56:08.454 --> 02:56:11.056]  Let's go to calls over here on this phone system.
[02:56:11.056 --> 02:56:18.523]  Oh wait, you pulled up the manufacturing process of aspartame there.
[02:56:18.523 --> 02:56:20.945]  It says the fermentation process.
[02:56:20.945 --> 02:56:22.086]  It's a nice way of putting it.
[02:56:22.086 --> 02:56:23.127]  With the E. coli.
[02:56:24.667 --> 02:56:41.313]  And then they feed them the toxic waste, literally, they feed them chemicals, and then the E. coli, genetically engineered E. coli, to be able to eat the chemicals, they then put out what you think is so sweet and delicious.
[02:56:41.313 --> 02:56:43.073]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:56:43.073 --> 02:56:54.297]  They call it the seed tank, provides an ideal environment for growing more bacteria, and is filled with things bacteria need to thrive, including warm water, carbohydrate foods, and it goes on and on and on.
[02:56:59.155 --> 02:57:00.677]  You tell people that and they just don't believe it.
[02:57:00.677 --> 02:57:03.760]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see it.
[02:57:03.760 --> 02:57:05.341]  Let's go to Nicolette in Ohio.
[02:57:05.341 --> 02:57:08.665]  Nicolette, thank you for holding.
[02:57:08.665 --> 02:57:10.306]  I had a couple of questions.
[02:57:10.306 --> 02:57:17.153]  The first one, have you heard about what's going on up here in Ohio and the little FEMA exercise with First Energy on the 29th?
[02:57:17.153 --> 02:57:19.095]  There's a lot of FEMA takeover drills.
[02:57:22.546 --> 02:57:22.946]  Echo.
[02:57:22.946 --> 02:57:27.329]  I'm sorry.
[02:57:27.329 --> 02:57:29.250]  I'm sorry.
[02:57:29.250 --> 02:57:33.212]  Ma'am, you there?
[02:57:33.212 --> 02:57:34.252]  Yes, I'm still here.
[02:57:34.252 --> 02:57:39.495]  Go ahead and tell me about the particular drill.
[02:57:39.495 --> 02:57:44.638]  Okay, this particular drill starts on Wednesday up here and it's through First Energy.
[02:57:44.638 --> 02:57:47.260]  They have 4.5 million customers here in Ohio.
[02:57:51.308 --> 02:57:59.153]  They've suggested that their employees go to this training drill and it's on the JimmyOnTheSpot.com.
[02:57:59.153 --> 02:58:01.494]  It's actually on your Prison Planet forum.
[02:58:01.494 --> 02:58:04.236]  It's just this large article about what's going to be happening up here.
[02:58:04.236 --> 02:58:16.262]  Yeah, I actually have a FEMA drill document with nationwide drive-through injectors and Walmart's doing drills where you drive through and they go, thank you.
[02:58:16.262 --> 02:58:17.663]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:58:17.663 --> 02:58:18.744]  Can you hold some more, Nicolette?
[02:58:19.571 --> 02:58:19.711]  Sure.
[02:58:19.711 --> 02:58:24.114]  Alright, because I'm going to bring Steve Quayle up, but we'll take calls while Steve is on with us.
[02:58:24.114 --> 02:58:27.896]  From Nicolette, Sherry, Dave, Carter, George, you've been holding this long, why not stay?
[02:58:27.896 --> 02:58:35.040]  Nathan, Leo, Bill, Dominique, JD, I've got two different phone systems here, and we'll see if I can get to these calls.
[02:58:35.040 --> 02:58:38.002]  Alright, we continue to go onward through the fog.
[02:58:38.002 --> 02:58:39.642]  Steve Quayle, straight ahead.
[02:58:39.642 --> 02:58:43.285]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.285 --> 02:58:45.906]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.906 --> 02:58:48.848]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.357 --> 02:58:53.058]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.058 --> 02:58:57.799]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.799 --> 02:59:00.741]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.741 --> 02:59:03.802]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.802 --> 02:59:09.644]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.884 --> 02:59:13.107]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.107 --> 02:59:20.112]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.112 --> 02:59:23.375]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.375 --> 02:59:23.655]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:23.655 --> 02:59:25.276]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:28.539 --> 02:59:34.784]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, prescribed and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:59:34.784 --> 02:59:38.406]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.406 --> 02:59:39.947]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:39.947 --> 02:59:40.548]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.548 --> 02:59:42.369]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.221 --> 02:59:56.602]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:59:56.602 --> 03:00:06.468]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:06.468 --> 03:00:12.292]  We interrupt this program with a special bulletin.
[03:00:12.292 --> 03:00:16.495]  America is now under martial law.
[03:00:16.495 --> 03:00:21.798]  All constitutional rights have been suspended.
[03:00:22.970 --> 03:00:25.011]  Stay in your home.
[03:00:25.011 --> 03:00:32.814]  Do not attempt to contact loved ones, insurance agents, or attorneys.
[03:00:32.814 --> 03:00:34.294]  Shut up!
[03:00:34.294 --> 03:00:39.536]  Do not attempt to think or depression may occur.
[03:00:39.536 --> 03:00:41.397]  Stay in your home.
[03:00:41.397 --> 03:00:43.818]  Curfew is at 7pm sharp.
[03:00:44.753 --> 03:00:55.576]  After work, anyone caught outside the gates of their subdivision sectors after curfew will be shot.
[03:00:55.576 --> 03:00:57.576]  Remain calm.
[03:00:57.576 --> 03:00:59.356]  Do not panic.
[03:00:59.356 --> 03:01:05.718]  Your neighborhood watch officer will be by to collect urine samples in the morning.
[03:01:07.100 --> 03:01:15.345]  Anyone caught interfering with the collection of urine samples will be shot.
[03:01:15.345 --> 03:01:17.807]  Stay in your home.
[03:01:17.807 --> 03:01:19.968]  Remain calm.
[03:01:19.968 --> 03:01:24.031]  The number one enemy of progress is questions.
[03:01:24.993 --> 03:01:30.517]  National security is more important than individual will.
[03:01:30.517 --> 03:01:36.762]  All sports broadcasts will proceed as normal.
[03:01:36.762 --> 03:01:42.647]  No more than two people may gather anywhere without permission.
[03:01:42.647 --> 03:01:46.810]  Use only the drugs prescribed by your boss or supervisor.
[03:01:48.317 --> 03:01:49.638]  Shut up!
[03:01:49.638 --> 03:01:51.059]  Be happy!
[03:01:51.059 --> 03:01:54.081]  Obey all orders without question!
[03:01:54.081 --> 03:01:58.144]  The comfort you've demanded is now mandatory!
[03:01:58.144 --> 03:01:59.525]  Be happy!
[03:01:59.525 --> 03:02:03.368]  At last, everything is done for you!
[03:02:06.340 --> 03:02:09.201]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[03:02:09.201 --> 03:02:11.782]  We have 58 minutes left in transmission.
[03:02:11.782 --> 03:02:13.763]  I may even do a bit of overdrive today.
[03:02:13.763 --> 03:02:24.548]  Syndicated talk show host, best-selling author, researcher Steve Quayle, who just last Monday on air said he thinks a stage flu epidemic was in the works, and that he had intel on that.
[03:02:24.548 --> 03:02:26.369]  And then look at what broke four or five days later.
[03:02:27.689 --> 03:02:34.253]  We've had a big 6.0 earthquake in Mexico City on top of things to make things even crazier.
[03:02:34.253 --> 03:02:43.659]  And Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, medical doctor who runs a clinic in Mexico down there in Monterey, at a huge conference at a five-star hotel there at that medical city, one of the most lavish in the world.
[03:02:43.659 --> 03:02:47.461]  They fly in from Saudi Arabia, you name it, the U.S., to go to that medical center.
[03:02:47.461 --> 03:02:48.242]  That's been shut down.
[03:02:48.242 --> 03:02:53.505]  They've been told, you fly out of the country, if you don't take this plane, we're going to put you on a bus and make you leave tomorrow.
[03:02:54.810 --> 03:03:01.936]  So all of that happening, the media hyping this, hyping this, and then saying, well, this may not be it, but another big one is coming.
[03:03:01.936 --> 03:03:03.077]  Get ready.
[03:03:03.077 --> 03:03:12.905]  And then we know the last few big flus broke out at military bases, the one that killed 40 million in 1918, and the 1976 one they used for forced inoculations that killed a bunch of people.
[03:03:12.905 --> 03:03:16.968]  Steve Quayle, we're about to break, but thanks for joining us on short notice.
[03:03:16.968 --> 03:03:18.730]  What's your inside scoop on what's happening?
[03:03:19.431 --> 03:03:36.000]  Well Alex, your emergency broadcast Saturday night was very well timed because the same control mechanism that was set up in the air, airborne command for martial law, basically ordered a stand down of all HF frequencies with the military.
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:36.560]  In other words,
[03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:39.421]  This is not the big event.
[03:03:39.421 --> 03:03:40.801]  This is the initiating event.
[03:03:40.801 --> 03:03:44.702]  This is the igniter event that's going to push us right there.
[03:03:44.702 --> 03:03:48.983]  And I've got to tell you, Alex, this is not just something that's going to go away.
[03:03:48.983 --> 03:03:57.685]  Because with the World Health Organization and all the different shills and the mouthpieces for the CDC and mainstream news, remember, this is the agenda.
[03:03:57.685 --> 03:03:59.245]  Back in, I think you've already talked about this.
[03:03:59.765 --> 03:04:12.643]  But back in the Air Force study that was written in 1996, they were predicting that in 2009 there would be a live H5N1 avian flu virus that would destroy 30 million people.
[03:04:12.643 --> 03:04:13.664]  Yeah, let me stop you there.
[03:04:13.664 --> 03:04:15.266]  That was in my stack.
[03:04:16.087 --> 03:04:27.314]  And I got so busy in the last three hours, that was one of my top stories, and I never even got to it, because I'm trying to not scare people.
[03:04:27.314 --> 03:04:40.183]  You know, I'm trying to get some calm here, but I think people are owed to know the fact, this was written in March 5th, 2009, so a month and a half ago, Kurt Nemo, with links to the now declassified documents, U.S.
[03:04:40.183 --> 03:04:43.285]  Air Force Study, proposed a 2009 influenza pandemic.
[03:04:45.106 --> 03:04:46.707]  For this, just this time of year.
[03:04:46.707 --> 03:04:50.428]  So, Steve, we'll get your expert analysis on that straight ahead.
[03:04:50.428 --> 03:04:53.910]  Yeah, I got a bad feeling about all this and I agree with Steve.
[03:04:53.910 --> 03:04:58.592]  This is the initiator for something big, as Homeland Security had chortled and said.
[03:04:58.592 --> 03:05:00.133]  Steve Quayle is our guest.
[03:05:00.133 --> 03:05:00.533]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.815 --> 03:05:05.318]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[03:05:05.318 --> 03:05:09.861]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[03:05:09.861 --> 03:05:17.727]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[03:05:18.052 --> 03:05:21.173]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[03:05:21.173 --> 03:05:28.795]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[03:05:28.795 --> 03:05:34.377]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[03:05:34.617 --> 03:05:40.459]  ProtoGro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[03:05:40.459 --> 03:05:44.001]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[03:05:44.001 --> 03:05:47.582]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[03:05:47.582 --> 03:05:52.664]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt-cheap superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[03:05:52.664 --> 03:05:55.545]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[03:05:55.545 --> 03:05:55.745]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:06:01.983 --> 03:06:07.805]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.805 --> 03:06:15.367]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.367 --> 03:06:21.529]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:21.969 --> 03:06:23.931]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:23.931 --> 03:06:26.433]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.433 --> 03:06:38.022]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:38.022 --> 03:06:39.703]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.703 --> 03:06:41.545]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:06:41.545 --> 03:06:47.770]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:06:48.436 --> 03:06:56.728]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:56.728 --> 03:06:58.290]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.290 --> 03:06:59.491]  The people strike back!
[03:07:01.385 --> 03:07:06.969]  As the economy continues to plummet, many of us will have to make difficult choices and cut back on our expenses.
[03:07:06.969 --> 03:07:09.930]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[03:07:09.930 --> 03:07:17.015]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, weak immune health, or just feel tired, you need to visit Shentritian.com.
[03:07:17.015 --> 03:07:21.358]  Shentritian is an innovative supplement that stimulates the healing power of the body.
[03:07:21.358 --> 03:07:23.399]  Shentritian is made up of two parts.
[03:07:23.399 --> 03:07:24.800]  The first part is superfoods,
[03:07:24.980 --> 03:07:25.600]  We're good to go!
[03:07:50.854 --> 03:07:53.476]  I have been attempting in the last three hours and eight minutes
[03:08:17.316 --> 03:08:20.818]  to just give you all sides, all angles, all possibilities.
[03:08:20.818 --> 03:08:33.324]  Did the Mexican government hide just a normal flu release to create fear, to kind of nip in the bud the revolution that was online to overthrow the government by this summer?
[03:08:33.324 --> 03:08:36.306]  Well, the problem is they're certainly using it for that.
[03:08:36.306 --> 03:08:44.050]  The problem here, though, is that this is three different flus, bird, pig, human mixed, from all over the world.
[03:08:44.050 --> 03:08:45.551]  It always comes out of Asia.
[03:08:48.223 --> 03:08:49.924]  And there's two different flu seasons in the world.
[03:08:49.924 --> 03:08:51.004]  Their season and our season.
[03:08:51.004 --> 03:08:53.065]  It always comes from there, always.
[03:08:53.065 --> 03:08:56.727]  Now it's appeared in Mexico.
[03:08:56.727 --> 03:09:03.450]  The reports we're getting, and it's been confirmed by BBC and others, is there's a lot more deaths than they're saying, a lot more illnesses than they're saying.
[03:09:03.450 --> 03:09:04.491]  But flu does that.
[03:09:04.491 --> 03:09:07.552]  It kills 15,000 plus Americans every year and tens of thousands of Mexicans.
[03:09:07.552 --> 03:09:10.614]  Because they have less health care, even though there's less people down there.
[03:09:10.614 --> 03:09:12.535]  A hundred million per capita, but more die down there.
[03:09:13.797 --> 03:09:20.738]  Well, first of all, the 1918 Spanish flu virus was cultivated by cadavers when specific teams from Fort Detrick and other countries went to areas where
[03:09:42.535 --> 03:09:44.937]  No, no, you've been saying that for over a decade everywhere.
[03:10:04.136 --> 03:10:04.776]  Yes.
[03:10:04.776 --> 03:10:13.460]  So the point is, is that based on my information, listen, what most people don't understand is that the biological weapons now are race-specific.
[03:10:13.460 --> 03:10:27.866]  And I want to cover this, I don't know if you've already covered this, but about a decade ago, one of the most famous bio-engineer scientists was arrested in South Africa who was working on race-specific gene-markered bioweapons.
[03:10:27.866 --> 03:10:30.247]  In other words, if they want to target whites, they can target whites.
[03:10:30.247 --> 03:10:33.609]  If they want to target blacks, they can target blacks, Latinos, Mexicans, you name it.
[03:10:33.789 --> 03:10:36.231]  And HIV has been reverse-engineered.
[03:10:36.231 --> 03:10:48.219]  That's why it's hundreds of times more deadly to blacks, especially, because they have the coupler points for it to plug in on, and pure northern Europeans do not even have it.
[03:10:48.219 --> 03:10:57.145]  That's why they've got studies in BBC just a few months ago about Italians, southern Italians, that have had a big African influx over the past few thousand years.
[03:10:57.145 --> 03:11:03.609]  Southern Italians are very susceptible to HIV, but northern Italians, which are really Austrians basically, can't get it.
[03:11:04.409 --> 03:11:04.789]  Absolutely.
[03:11:04.789 --> 03:11:06.530]  Now, here's what I want people to understand.
[03:11:06.530 --> 03:11:12.632]  Understand this, that you're going to be sent a massive amount of mixed signals.
[03:11:12.632 --> 03:11:14.172]  Number one, it isn't genetic altered.
[03:11:14.172 --> 03:11:15.213]  Yes, it is.
[03:11:15.213 --> 03:11:17.053]  Nothing in nature has it.
[03:11:17.053 --> 03:11:31.398]  Now, Alex, this specific strain and the strain that will come thereafter and the mutant variations in between, imagine having tentacles on the ends of the genes that are basically able to grab
[03:11:31.978 --> 03:11:35.741]  Any form of mutating viruses and or bacteria.
[03:11:35.741 --> 03:11:38.663]  This is how evil and sinister this is.
[03:11:38.663 --> 03:11:42.405]  And I think that people had better understand that this is not a trial run.
[03:11:42.405 --> 03:11:44.847]  This is the initiating run for the big run.
[03:11:44.847 --> 03:11:48.530]  We know this and I gotta touch on this because you need to hear this.
[03:11:48.530 --> 03:11:51.532]  On Saturday when you were doing your emergency broadcast,
[03:11:52.032 --> 03:11:57.696]  The entire command and control for martial law goes up in an airborne command structure.
[03:11:57.696 --> 03:12:01.658]  They ordered... That's the five doomsday planes which they now admit were activated.
[03:12:01.658 --> 03:12:08.143]  They told folks Sunday morning and admitted they initiated the martial law control grant under the executive orders.
[03:12:08.143 --> 03:12:08.443]  Go ahead.
[03:12:08.869 --> 03:12:09.950]  Absolutely.
[03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:21.619]  But what you don't know is that while you were on the air, the order went out to literally every single military, let's say, asset that was on HF High Frequency was told to get off.
[03:12:21.619 --> 03:12:26.642]  At the same time, every state's emergency communications network was activated.
[03:12:26.642 --> 03:12:33.167]  So when people think, Alex, that this is just a bunch of brouhaha that has no relevance, that's how serious it was.
[03:12:33.167 --> 03:12:35.109]  What people, you need to understand,
[03:12:35.609 --> 03:12:44.254]  That what was going on Saturday night was the entire command and control structure ready to go at a moment's notice.
[03:12:44.254 --> 03:12:46.676]  Alex, what I'm concerned about, first and foremost, is this.
[03:12:46.676 --> 03:12:56.462]  No one has done more investigation in the public sector with the assets that are available than I have in the genetically altered modification of viruses.
[03:12:56.462 --> 03:13:03.066]  From the time Mad Cow first broke out, I said, listen, this is going to be used as a bioweapon prior to it being released in Great Britain.
[03:13:03.406 --> 03:13:11.650]  I said, when you've got guys down in New Guinea checking out the headhunters for the disease called Kuru, I said, you can bet your bottom line somebody's developed a bioweapon.
[03:13:11.650 --> 03:13:20.674]  The thing that concerns me the most is the art and antiquities guy in Mexico that died 12 hours later after shaking Barack Obama's hand.
[03:13:20.674 --> 03:13:31.399]  The fact that we don't know, you know, the expedient nature of his death or how long he may have been exposed prior to dying is telltale to me.
[03:13:31.399 --> 03:13:32.360]  Again, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:13:32.720 --> 03:13:47.675]  Ten years ago, I wrote the book, Breathe No Evil, and Alex, given the 96 report, given what's going on, given everything that's taking place, this is the traditional shot fired across the good ship lollipop, the USA.
[03:13:48.115 --> 03:13:49.436]  And people had better get serious.
[03:13:49.436 --> 03:13:51.716]  Now here's something I think everybody's got to consider.
[03:13:51.716 --> 03:14:15.105]  If this is a specific race or genetic, excuse me, a race-specific or a genetically marked targeted group of people, a friend of mine, Doug McIntosh, just sent me an email saying, Steve, Cinco de Mayo is coming up, and if it is the race-specific bioweapon, then remember this, Alex, all you would need is people who to gather in large groups across the country who are
[03:14:15.885 --> 03:14:17.225]  What would you say?
[03:14:17.225 --> 03:14:22.227]  Specifically susceptible to this form of genetically altered virus and the rest is going to be history.
[03:14:22.227 --> 03:14:27.828]  And listen, Alex, it's not you and I making up these numbers, 30 million, 40 million, 50 million.
[03:14:27.828 --> 03:14:39.511]  Ladies and gentlemen, what has been done is to supercharge three of the most virulent pathogens that have ever been genetically tweaked in the history of this world.
[03:14:39.511 --> 03:14:43.452]  This is absolutely no exaggeration that this thing is
[03:14:44.052 --> 03:14:45.233]  We're good to go.
[03:15:04.920 --> 03:15:22.547]  The point that was obvious is that at some point, let's consider that a primary to a binary weapon, at some point when the chemtrails change, then the susceptibility of the systems, the human immune system that's been worn down by the initial chemtrail can be activated.
[03:15:22.547 --> 03:15:23.488]  That's one point.
[03:15:23.488 --> 03:15:26.409]  That's what you and others have always said, is that that is...
[03:15:30.342 --> 03:15:34.004]  What's the weapon system called where they give you half of it and then later give you the other half?
[03:15:34.004 --> 03:15:36.305]  Well, it's a binary.
[03:15:36.305 --> 03:15:53.272]  And so here's what's critical too, and people understanding this, you can literally take the CDC's reports and go back to when the chemtrails started, chemtrail spring started, following it through to when all the reports of how many respiratory diseases, and I'm getting every day with no exaggeration 20, 30, 40 emails
[03:15:54.973 --> 03:16:07.761]  Well, that's what this flu does is it causes people to die just like the 1918 swine flu or bird flu that killed so many, Spanish flu if I got the name right.
[03:16:07.761 --> 03:16:09.362]  That one hit the respiratory system.
[03:16:09.927 --> 03:16:24.680]  Absolutely, but what is interesting to people is not only do they, when they, you buy a, when you're engineering a biological weapon, you absolutely, at the same time you are designing the weapon, you're designing the antidote or the vaccine, okay?
[03:16:25.260 --> 03:16:25.680]  We're good.
[03:16:43.826 --> 03:16:48.727]  And one of the signals is there are 751 flights out of Mexico City a day to points around the world.
[03:16:48.727 --> 03:16:50.168]  That's the number 13.
[03:16:50.168 --> 03:16:54.149]  The first announcement coming out of New Zealand was that there were 13 people infected.
[03:16:54.149 --> 03:17:05.892]  If everybody knows their history of biological warfare, especially after the Second World War in Japan, you're dealing with Dr. Ishii and Unit 731, which some people said was more accurately called 751.
[03:17:05.892 --> 03:17:12.374]  Now, if you understand, too, the history of Mexico City and the whole Aztec Empire and everything,
[03:17:12.674 --> 03:17:19.501]  You've got to understand that there is a severe occult symbolism of meeting at the pyramids.
[03:17:19.501 --> 03:17:31.693]  Of meeting at the key pyramid where more people were slain in a day than some armies were slain in a year of fighting in a world... And listen, this is very esoteric, but I knew you would bring this up because I was already thinking this and we're on the same track.
[03:17:32.253 --> 03:17:37.197]  You know, when I talk about weather weapons, seismic weapons, people would laugh, but it's now been declassified.
[03:17:37.197 --> 03:17:38.418]  It's not the details.
[03:17:38.418 --> 03:17:40.300]  Here is the news transcript, U.S.
[03:17:40.300 --> 03:17:42.101]  Department of Defense.
[03:17:42.101 --> 03:17:53.011]  If you Google, DOD briefing, Secretary of Defense S. Cohen, earthquake weapons, it comes up, and here's the transcript of it, 1997.
[03:17:53.011 --> 03:17:54.972]  It's on screen right now.
[03:17:54.972 --> 03:17:55.272]  Let me...
[03:17:57.847 --> 03:18:15.235]  He goes on to say, Alvin Toffler has written about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic-specific so they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races, and others are designing some sort of engineering, some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops.
[03:18:15.235 --> 03:18:22.319]  Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate
[03:18:22.819 --> 03:18:27.581]  Set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.
[03:18:27.581 --> 03:18:33.284]  And this is what Dick Cheney then says in the September 20th, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[03:18:33.284 --> 03:18:36.105]  We want to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[03:18:36.105 --> 03:18:36.825]  You have a 6.0.
[03:18:36.825 --> 03:18:39.306]  They haven't had one of those in years.
[03:18:39.306 --> 03:18:44.409]  And it's right on Mexico City, right as all this is happening.
[03:18:44.409 --> 03:18:45.169]  And you're right.
[03:18:45.169 --> 03:18:46.870]  This is a satanic center.
[03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:49.671]  The elites are... This is all just getting too weird, Steve.
[03:18:50.325 --> 03:19:02.354]  Well, can I tell you this, Alex, and I know that there are certain things that, you know, we're trying to cover, but the esoteric nature of it is the very spirit behind everything you've written about, Alex, everything you've broadcast about.
[03:19:02.354 --> 03:19:12.462]  Though people see the literal nuts and bolts of how it's being implemented, when these individuals are meeting at the pyramids, when they're meeting at the sacrificial centers of the world,
[03:19:12.962 --> 03:19:20.789]  Now that you've got the earthquakes happening, and don't forget one of the biggest volcanoes in the world is Popo, in the vicinity of Mexico City.
[03:19:20.789 --> 03:19:27.595]  I think the thing that people really have got to get through their head now is that they have to take an active role.
[03:19:27.595 --> 03:19:33.941]  You and I have taught them how to fish, but we can't put the fish and reel in their hand and point them to the waterhole of knowledge.
[03:19:33.941 --> 03:19:34.981]  They've got to act.
[03:19:34.981 --> 03:19:35.982]  They have got to prepare.
[03:19:35.982 --> 03:19:36.523]  And Alex,
[03:19:36.923 --> 03:19:41.287]  This esoteric nature of it is the spirit behind all of it.
[03:19:41.287 --> 03:19:59.062]  Listen, just as that represents Mexico City, represents the blood-sacrifice capital of the world, the Luciferians were sending a signal that out of the blood-sacrifice capital city of the world would go the ultimate Luciferian sacrifice of I don't know how many dead, but trust me, 50 millions on the white side.
[03:19:59.062 --> 03:20:00.223]  Stay there, stay there, stay there!
[03:20:01.701 --> 03:20:04.183]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[03:20:04.183 --> 03:20:07.987]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[03:20:07.987 --> 03:20:10.790]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:18.017]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[03:20:18.137 --> 03:20:23.224]  Having your hard-earned money in banks, the stock market, or any other paper asset is a lose-lose deal.
[03:20:23.224 --> 03:20:28.351]  You'll lose on your capital investment, and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar continues to devalue.
[03:20:28.351 --> 03:20:34.460]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[03:20:34.580 --> 03:20:38.741]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[03:20:38.741 --> 03:20:44.542]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:20:44.542 --> 03:20:49.583]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[03:20:49.583 --> 03:20:54.024]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:20:54.024 --> 03:20:56.684]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[03:20:56.684 --> 03:20:57.144]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:21:02.206 --> 03:21:04.787]  In the New World Order's war against humanity.
[03:21:05.402 --> 03:21:08.243]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:08.243 --> 03:21:14.106]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.106 --> 03:21:20.610]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.610 --> 03:21:22.591]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.591 --> 03:21:25.052]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:25.052 --> 03:21:34.797]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[03:21:35.256 --> 03:21:38.219]  That's fascism.
[03:21:38.219 --> 03:21:39.901]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.901 --> 03:21:41.762]  It's about a one world government.
[03:21:41.762 --> 03:21:48.669]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.669 --> 03:21:56.937]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.937 --> 03:21:58.519]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.519 --> 03:21:59.700]  The people strike back.
[03:22:01.721 --> 03:22:05.804]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[03:22:05.804 --> 03:22:11.688]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[03:22:11.688 --> 03:22:12.809]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[03:22:12.809 --> 03:22:17.492]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:22:17.492 --> 03:22:30.741]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[03:22:31.301 --> 03:22:36.902]  For this reason Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[03:22:36.902 --> 03:22:43.543]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[03:22:43.543 --> 03:22:44.823]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:44.823 --> 03:22:46.344]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[03:22:46.344 --> 03:22:46.804]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:46.804 --> 03:22:49.004]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[03:22:49.004 --> 03:22:49.064]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.198 --> 03:23:04.299]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:23:04.299 --> 03:23:09.822]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:23:09.822 --> 03:23:15.544]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:23:15.544 --> 03:23:17.025]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:23:17.025 --> 03:23:26.029]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:23:26.329 --> 03:23:28.170]  Now compare Kalben Pure Soap.

[03:23:54.902 --> 03:23:55.823]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[03:24:12.788 --> 03:24:21.132]  Steve Quayle, I want to open the phones up for quick questions from Nathan Leobill, Dominic J.D., Nicolette, Sherry, Dave, Carter, George, Nathan, Morty.
[03:24:21.132 --> 03:24:23.393]  We're going to take a lot of calls in the next segment.
[03:24:23.393 --> 03:24:26.635]  Just quick questions or comments from all of them.
[03:24:26.635 --> 03:24:29.356]  And then get your take on it.
[03:24:29.356 --> 03:24:35.499]  We'll also put up on screen your website for folks as well.
[03:24:35.499 --> 03:24:36.680]  But Steve, look.
[03:24:38.035 --> 03:24:44.382]  We know they use this type of hype to train everybody to take the vaccines, to take the Tanaflu, to take the drugs.
[03:24:44.382 --> 03:24:45.323]  The government's your friend.
[03:24:45.323 --> 03:24:46.685]  It gives you a little mask.
[03:24:46.685 --> 03:24:52.050]  But they leave our borders wide open while Europe is screening Americans and Mexicans that fly in.
[03:24:52.050 --> 03:24:56.756]  They're banning our food imports to Germany and Russia and England and others.
[03:24:58.336 --> 03:25:02.879]  I mean, if there's not something to this, it's a crime that they're hyping it up.
[03:25:02.879 --> 03:25:05.941]  And then we've got all the news of cover-ups of how many have really died.
[03:25:05.941 --> 03:25:11.986]  And then you look at this clearly engineered virus, the doctors we've had on have said clearly.
[03:25:11.986 --> 03:25:16.329]  I mean, they usually talk about, you know, bird flu mixing with human.
[03:25:17.450 --> 03:25:19.792]  It, you know, some of the variants having evidence of this.
[03:25:19.792 --> 03:25:33.063]  And then they say that the maker of the vaccine that the UN has chosen is Baxter, the company we've been railing against who tried, who told 18 sub-companies in Europe to mix live bird flu with regular vaccine.
[03:25:33.063 --> 03:25:34.444]  Thank God they got caught.
[03:25:34.444 --> 03:25:37.527]  But then some unnamed companies in mainstream news, London Telegraph,
[03:25:37.967 --> 03:25:42.889]  That was paying city workers to give homeless shots and paying them, and the homeless were dying of bird flu.
[03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:45.410]  In fact, put that up on screen about the homeless dying of bird flu.
[03:25:45.410 --> 03:25:48.351]  I want people to see these mainstream articles who don't believe us.
[03:25:48.351 --> 03:25:50.671]  I mean, something stinks here, Steve.
[03:25:50.671 --> 03:25:53.112]  I mean, I'm seeing a lot of crazy stuff.
[03:25:53.112 --> 03:25:57.874]  I don't know what's coming out of this, but definitely this has got New World Order fingerprints all over it.
[03:25:58.464 --> 03:25:59.364]  Well, absolutely.
[03:25:59.364 --> 03:26:03.446]  And for those of you, the people that are biblically inclined, this is the pestilence.
[03:26:03.446 --> 03:26:06.226]  This is one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.
[03:26:06.226 --> 03:26:07.927]  And I think that people need to understand this.
[03:26:07.927 --> 03:26:08.947]  We're being isolated.
[03:26:08.947 --> 03:26:15.629]  Alex, I said five years ago, the time will come when no trains will run, no planes will fly, no cars, no vehicles, etc.
[03:26:15.629 --> 03:26:18.130]  America will become completely isolated.
[03:26:18.590 --> 03:26:24.034]  It will be isolated in that we will be cut off, we will be considered the pariah nation of the world.
[03:26:24.034 --> 03:26:29.397]  Now let's get back to Mexico really quick because I think this is what's going to take down the economy, okay?
[03:26:29.397 --> 03:26:31.959]  Our economy, not just Mexico's economy.
[03:26:31.959 --> 03:26:35.621]  My sources on the ground in that area are claiming 2,000 dead.
[03:26:35.621 --> 03:26:35.721]  2,000 dead.
[03:26:38.883 --> 03:26:42.265]  Now, first of all, I believe nothing that comes out of officialdom.
[03:26:42.265 --> 03:26:49.470]  I believe that the CDC is only there to control and, how should I say this, disseminate the information.
[03:26:49.470 --> 03:26:54.914]  I believe that this is, if you will, imagine America as the test tube, this is the test case.
[03:26:55.434 --> 03:27:06.317]  And so, over the years, when you and I would talk about the depopulation of the world, 90%, we got, you know, all the tinfoil hat boys to get together on boards and hoist a few Scotches to us.
[03:27:06.317 --> 03:27:23.221]  But now, this is something that even strikes the boldest skeptic, because the smallest virus, the smallest bug, the question is, are they testing first on a select, confined population, i.e., Mexicans, Hispanics, Latinos,
[03:27:23.901 --> 03:27:33.184]  Or is this just the fear to make everyone run to the answer, the Hegelian dialectic, by injection and take the vaccination?
[03:27:33.184 --> 03:27:37.145]  I am convinced the vaccination is the execution dose.
[03:27:37.145 --> 03:27:43.267]  If you deny or decline to take the vaccination, that's when the camps come in, that's when the martial law comes in, Alex.
[03:27:43.267 --> 03:27:43.847]  Oh my God!
[03:27:44.187 --> 03:27:46.189]  Why didn't I see this?
[03:27:46.189 --> 03:27:47.189]  Of course!
[03:27:47.189 --> 03:28:03.102]  Baxter's caught breeding up millions of dosages of vaccine with live bird flu that the scientists in the Czech Republic said would be a perfect way to create a master airborne mutagen with a 90% kill rate with that particular version of bird flu when you can ingest it.
[03:28:03.102 --> 03:28:04.603]  If you actually get it, you're in deep trouble.
[03:28:05.163 --> 03:28:18.426]  And then they're making all these vaccines, the news won't say where all the vaccine stock went, and then Baxter is chosen out of hundreds of major companies to be the one to make the vaccine for this flu.
[03:28:18.426 --> 03:28:20.806]  Oh my, oh man.
[03:28:20.806 --> 03:28:23.667]  This is so insipidly wicked.
[03:28:23.667 --> 03:28:25.667]  This is so horrific.
[03:28:25.667 --> 03:28:33.569]  I honestly believe, Alex, and I make no bones about this, by the way, my guesstimate on time based on what I'm sensing in my gut
[03:28:34.275 --> 03:28:38.158]  It's from about Thursday on, things are going to turn totally bad.
[03:28:38.158 --> 03:28:41.200]  You know, I caught nothing but crap for putting up the Orange Alert.
[03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:43.141]  People were saying, oh, you shouldn't do this, you shouldn't do that.
[03:28:43.141 --> 03:28:44.802]  And I stand by that alert.
[03:28:44.802 --> 03:28:48.685]  I did not put up that alert without a lot of intercessors praying.
[03:28:48.685 --> 03:28:49.645]  I sought the Lord.
[03:28:49.645 --> 03:28:52.367]  I said, God, I cannot afford to be wrong on this one.
[03:28:52.367 --> 03:28:54.228]  Not for my sake, but for your people's sake.
[03:28:54.228 --> 03:28:55.529]  Now, here's the deal.
[03:28:55.529 --> 03:28:57.531]  The situation that's going on right now is
[03:28:58.551 --> 03:29:00.112]  Absolutely.
[03:29:00.112 --> 03:29:10.838]  So diabolically wicked that the simple Western mind of well-meaning Americans cannot even embrace the thought of what you just had as a revelation.
[03:29:10.838 --> 03:29:11.859]  They cannot embrace it.
[03:29:12.461 --> 03:29:21.707]  Therefore, because they reject the knowledge, or, you know, the mainstream will call you and I the tinfoil boys or whatever, you know?
[03:29:21.707 --> 03:29:27.770]  The bottom line in all this, and I keep saying that, Alex, cutting to the chase, this is the initiating action.
[03:29:27.770 --> 03:29:30.992]  What comes from this point on is the death.
[03:29:30.992 --> 03:29:34.094]  Well, take 76.
[03:29:34.094 --> 03:29:36.576]  The swine flu wasn't killing anybody.
[03:29:37.671 --> 03:29:39.292]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[03:30:05.529 --> 03:30:08.152]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:30:08.152 --> 03:30:15.741]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:30:15.741 --> 03:30:21.908]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:30:22.328 --> 03:30:24.289]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:30:24.289 --> 03:30:26.791]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:30:26.791 --> 03:30:38.379]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:30:38.379 --> 03:30:40.060]  It's not about left or right.
[03:30:40.060 --> 03:30:41.921]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:30:41.921 --> 03:30:48.145]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:30:57.071 --> 03:30:58.653]  The Obama Deception.
[03:30:58.653 --> 03:30:59.855]  The people strike back!
[03:31:02.150 --> 03:31:05.671]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:31:05.671 --> 03:31:11.072]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:31:11.072 --> 03:31:16.234]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:31:16.234 --> 03:31:27.337]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.

[03:32:58.418 --> 03:33:19.523]  All right, your calls are coming up with our guest Steve Quayle at the end of the hour, end of the show, and then it starts back over with Dr. Tim Penny from Mexico and Dr. Diggle popping in, Paul Watson from England.
[03:33:20.984 --> 03:33:22.145]  You know, I just want to be clear here.
[03:33:22.145 --> 03:33:27.829]  The State Department ran them 200, saying they've got to sterilize and reduce the population by half.
[03:33:27.829 --> 03:33:33.754]  Biological diversity assessment by the U.N., 1996, and others saying they want to get rid of 80% of us.
[03:33:33.754 --> 03:33:39.358]  The official statements, Dr. Eric Bianca, I just use him because it made national news, most people heard about him.
[03:33:39.358 --> 03:33:45.402]  It was big news for a few weeks, said, you know, he wants 90% of us to die with an airborne Ebola.
[03:33:45.402 --> 03:33:48.064]  And then he can't wait for everybody to die and he wants it to be basically engineered.
[03:33:48.064 --> 03:33:49.465]  And the FBI even went and visited him.
[03:33:49.465 --> 03:33:50.286]  We called for that.
[03:33:52.093 --> 03:34:04.459]  When you go to Pianca's site at UT, I haven't checked this in about a year, Google Dr. Eric Pianca UT and it'll be EDU, it'll be University of Texas site.
[03:34:04.459 --> 03:34:08.761]  It's him in druid robes saying he's a druid and that he loves Lucifer.
[03:34:08.761 --> 03:34:10.581]  This is on University of Texas site.
[03:34:10.581 --> 03:34:15.424]  Now, this guy who is a druid, goes to class as a druid, big beard, biologist,
[03:34:16.184 --> 03:34:21.469]  He has all these graduate students that sent us threatening emails and people that, oh, I went to him ten years ago, he's great.
[03:34:21.469 --> 03:34:27.034]  It's them in white lab coats as doctors and biologists in BioShield bioweapons programs.
[03:34:27.034 --> 03:34:32.199]  You know, the BioShield program you hear is to fight bioweapons, but they admit it's really a bioweapons program.
[03:34:32.199 --> 03:34:35.242]  But the key here is this guy got up and got a standing ovation
[03:34:35.922 --> 03:34:36.443]  At St.
[03:34:36.443 --> 03:34:37.444]  Edwards here in Austin.
[03:34:37.444 --> 03:34:42.129]  It was in the paper and it was also Texas Academy of Sciences when he was meeting in South Texas.
[03:34:42.129 --> 03:34:45.512]  All over the world he gets standing ovations when he says kill 90% of us.
[03:34:45.512 --> 03:34:50.858]  And his graduate students sent me papers saying, look, Jones, he is a conservative.
[03:34:50.858 --> 03:34:52.800]  I believe the humans are a parasite.
[03:34:52.800 --> 03:34:55.283]  We did reports on this at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:34:55.283 --> 03:34:56.344]  All humans should be killed.
[03:34:57.938 --> 03:35:05.424]  So, this is what Prince Philip, Ted Turner, the UN, the Kissingers, so when Steve gets into all of this, they admit they're Luciferians.
[03:35:05.424 --> 03:35:19.334]  We, even if you're an atheist, the point is, cold-bloodedly, just from an anthropological, you know, view, or studying the elites, you know, if you're studying, you know, I mean, if you wrote a book, The Elites of the World in the Year 2009, you know, published 2020 or whatever, let's, you know, imaginary book,
[03:35:23.332 --> 03:35:29.478]  And you were just an anthropologist, sociologist, looking at what the elites really believed?
[03:35:29.478 --> 03:35:33.882]  They're a bunch of bloodthirsty killers that want to kill everybody for Gaia.
[03:35:33.882 --> 03:35:37.506]  Earth First Battalion and the Pentagon, all of this.
[03:35:37.506 --> 03:35:42.851]  And so when Steve talks about all this from his Christian perspective, and I'm a Christian as well, not a mainline fake Christian,
[03:35:44.611 --> 03:35:56.418]  Regardless, the real data shows that, and so we have to look at this when they're saying swine flu virus may cause global pandemic, United Nations, French News Agency, and, you know, U.S.
[03:35:56.418 --> 03:36:00.341]  emergency declared, and, in fact, I didn't even get to this.
[03:36:00.341 --> 03:36:03.202]  It's in my stack of mainstream news, where the U.S.
[03:36:03.202 --> 03:36:06.945]  government is saying stay indoors in these areas in Texas.
[03:36:08.065 --> 03:36:11.027]  Uh, Napolitano says the really bad stuff's to come.
[03:36:11.027 --> 03:36:13.809]  America's told to wear a mask as swine flu spreads around the globe.
[03:36:13.809 --> 03:36:17.171]  Remember the media told you that you didn't need masks?
[03:36:17.171 --> 03:36:18.972]  It was safe at Ground Zero?
[03:36:18.972 --> 03:36:20.533]  We got on there and said you needed them?
[03:36:20.533 --> 03:36:22.434]  Well, the point is you need a nano mask.
[03:36:22.434 --> 03:36:28.797]  Just a regular mask may reduce a piece of spit in the air, somebody sneezes, you know, some mucus that's got the virus in it.
[03:36:28.797 --> 03:36:30.999]  So it does help reduce, but it doesn't completely protect you.
[03:36:30.999 --> 03:36:32.260]  You need to get a nano mask.
[03:36:33.200 --> 03:36:37.223]  I worry about folks like my dad who's a dentist doing bloody procedures every day.
[03:36:37.223 --> 03:36:39.065]  But again, it's all hype right now.
[03:36:39.065 --> 03:36:39.906]  Why all the fear?
[03:36:39.906 --> 03:36:42.388]  Why the gearing up when other flus go far more than this?
[03:36:42.388 --> 03:36:44.129]  Well, it's unseasonable.
[03:36:44.129 --> 03:36:45.770]  Didn't come from the East.
[03:36:45.770 --> 03:36:49.293]  Is a weird transgenetic mixture.
[03:36:49.293 --> 03:36:50.935]  Telltale designer.
[03:36:50.935 --> 03:36:52.116]  Came out of Mexico.
[03:36:52.116 --> 03:36:53.077]  Not in the flu season.
[03:36:54.140 --> 03:37:11.421]  uh... just all of this is going on and other countries are acting scared to death of this something's going on and i hope they pull back from whatever they're planning uh... but you know we've given you the first few hours the view that it's a hoax the view that they're hyping it but remember who's doing it they've proven they're capable of anything.
[03:37:11.421 --> 03:37:11.862]  Steve Coyle.
[03:37:12.892 --> 03:37:17.596]  First of all, people are emailing me asking me, do I think this is just a distraction?
[03:37:17.596 --> 03:37:32.028]  I would say this is part of the entire plan, because Alex, and everyone I've interviewed over 25 years in the world of spooks, kooks, and everything else that comes along the way, and spies, counter-spies, intelligence, military, etc.
[03:37:32.808 --> 03:37:47.535]  The central theme you've got is that these entities, okay, that worship Lucifer and hate Jesus, by the way, the idea is that they are going to distract with as many issues as they can to simply overwhelm us.
[03:37:47.535 --> 03:37:54.698]  Because, look, if it isn't the money system that everybody's worrying about, gee, how am I going to retire, blah, blah, blah, now they've got to worry about this, worry about that.
[03:37:54.698 --> 03:37:58.700]  This is all part of the plan to simply overwhelm.
[03:37:58.700 --> 03:38:00.841]  This is the shock and awfulness
[03:38:01.301 --> 03:38:01.661]  I don't know.
[03:38:23.465 --> 03:38:23.966]  We're good to go.
[03:38:43.408 --> 03:38:43.749]  We're good.
[03:39:01.426 --> 03:39:02.227]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:39:18.843 --> 03:39:32.852]  Biologically engineered, and Alex, when Woutard-Basson, ladies and gentlemen, go Google it on my website, SteveQuayle.com, when he was arrested, the most powerful, richest people in the world demanded his release.
[03:39:32.852 --> 03:39:33.753]  Guess what, Alex?
[03:39:33.753 --> 03:39:34.694]  He wrote the book.
[03:39:34.694 --> 03:39:42.299]  He was the one that was the breakthrough scientist on race-specific targeted genetic weapons.
[03:39:42.299 --> 03:39:44.200]  Now, that doesn't scare the hell out of everybody.
[03:39:44.200 --> 03:39:47.482]  Maybe, brother, you and I need to just, you know, hold our breath or something.
[03:39:48.484 --> 03:40:07.649]  And if it doesn't provoke them to take action, nothing, here, nothing the DHS says, Department of Human Sacrifice, nothing the official mouthpieces say, look, even to a certain degree, those people at that level don't understand the higher levels of esoteric murder, okay?
[03:40:07.649 --> 03:40:12.991]  Or ritual, satanic deliverance of the innocence to death.
[03:40:12.991 --> 03:40:17.112]  And I can't fault them on that, obviously they don't see it, but what they don't understand
[03:40:17.512 --> 03:40:23.494]  Is once they're done implementing, they're taking down of, quote, the Red List, they get whacked within 30 to 45 days.
[03:40:23.494 --> 03:40:25.974]  You brought up the United Nations, okay?
[03:40:25.974 --> 03:40:30.616]  And that professor, I remember doing a show with you when you brought him up before.
[03:40:30.616 --> 03:40:33.536]  What people don't understand, the United Nations has a process.
[03:40:33.536 --> 03:40:34.937]  You ready for this, Alex?
[03:40:34.937 --> 03:40:40.838]  The name of taking down the first population is called Curative Process.
[03:40:40.838 --> 03:40:42.619]  C-U-R-A-I-T-V-E.
[03:40:42.619 --> 03:40:43.639]  The interesting word, is it?
[03:40:46.727 --> 03:40:47.288]  Steve, go ahead.
[03:40:47.288 --> 03:40:48.590]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:55.500]  I just wanted to give you... So, based on the... based on where we're at right now, this is not just a little flash in the pan.
[03:40:55.942 --> 03:41:00.704]  This is not the normal vectoring of a pathogenic release.
[03:41:00.704 --> 03:41:04.726]  This is simultaneous releases in different parts of the world.
[03:41:04.726 --> 03:41:08.987]  And normally they would have been following it as it was in Asia moving to Europe.
[03:41:08.987 --> 03:41:11.008]  Here it just pops up in Mexico.
[03:41:11.008 --> 03:41:12.689]  Flues don't do that.
[03:41:12.689 --> 03:41:16.251]  This thing is clearly manufactured.
[03:41:16.251 --> 03:41:18.391]  The question is, is it a false alarm?
[03:41:18.391 --> 03:41:20.572]  Or is it what Dr. Diegel was saying earlier?
[03:41:20.572 --> 03:41:24.234]  It seems you're saying it's a carrier to turn into something worse.
[03:41:24.764 --> 03:41:42.549]  I'm agreeing with Dr. Deagle, but I'm saying that, and I absolutely agree with him, and the thing is, is that, to my knowledge, when he and I have talked off the record and off the mic, he was intimately and intricately involved in a lot of the machinations of viral weapon development.
[03:41:42.549 --> 03:41:47.331]  Saying all that, Alex, the thing that people need to know is what they can do, and I'll tell you this.
[03:41:47.751 --> 03:41:50.072]  They had better consider the basics.
[03:41:50.072 --> 03:41:54.174]  They should really be looking at the fact of looking where the clusters come.
[03:41:54.174 --> 03:41:55.435]  Here's how I think it'll be.
[03:41:55.435 --> 03:42:01.218]  It'll be, it'll take place, the Marshall Implementation will ultimately start in stages, okay?
[03:42:01.218 --> 03:42:07.161]  Whether it's Texas border towns or it's the entire border, but as you've said, this border, isn't it strange?
[03:42:07.161 --> 03:42:14.305]  We've got the most dangerous, pathogenic emergency, health emergency declared by Janet Napolitano
[03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:15.070]  I don't know.
[03:42:33.464 --> 03:42:39.086]  This next coming 5 days to 14 days is going to be absolutely critical.
[03:42:39.086 --> 03:42:43.828]  If Mexico... Yeah, well that's when they always are launching all sorts of bizarre occult activities.
[03:42:43.828 --> 03:42:47.830]  Launching the revolution of the Soviets and others is on May Day.
[03:42:47.830 --> 03:42:48.970]  It's an occult day.
[03:42:48.970 --> 03:42:52.132]  By the way, look at Dr. Eric Pianca's UT page.
[03:42:52.132 --> 03:42:55.153]  It's all about DNA sequencing and how he wants to get rid of people.
[03:42:55.153 --> 03:42:56.773]  And then you go to his obituary.
[03:42:56.773 --> 03:42:58.094]  He has a link on there.
[03:42:58.094 --> 03:43:00.115]  Official University of Texas Biology Department.
[03:43:00.635 --> 03:43:16.985]  He says, I'm not dead yet, and he calls himself the Lizard Man and the Snake Man, and then you scroll down, he's in here talking about Lucifer, and then he names his animals Lucifer, and then he's dressed up like a druid in here.
[03:43:16.985 --> 03:43:29.513]  I mean, this guy, this is who wants 90% of us at least to die, and he's got his ranch out there, and it says, I mean, just absolutely amazing.
[03:43:30.693 --> 03:43:33.594]  It used to have him dressed up like a druid on here.
[03:43:33.594 --> 03:43:35.575]  We did find another page that has the picture of him.
[03:43:35.575 --> 03:43:38.236]  I mean, that was on his UT site.
[03:43:38.236 --> 03:43:39.376]  It may be on a subpage.
[03:43:39.376 --> 03:43:40.477]  I hate to interrupt.
[03:43:40.477 --> 03:43:48.380]  Well, you know, regardless, they're going to use all this fear they're hyping, Steve, to get more control over society.
[03:43:48.380 --> 03:43:53.722]  We know that they are, you know, doing that and training us that they're the saviors.
[03:43:53.722 --> 03:43:59.644]  Hey, Alex, one of the things people need to recognize, why is it that Independent slash supposedly Independent Network
[03:44:00.200 --> 03:44:04.582]  Always use the same neuro-linguistic programming term.
[03:44:04.582 --> 03:44:06.363]  You turn on CBS, it's the same term.
[03:44:06.363 --> 03:44:12.045]  You turn on ABC or whatever, you know, MSNBC, whatever you're looking at, Bloomberg, etc.
[03:44:12.045 --> 03:44:13.826]  It's almost like the scriptwriters.
[03:44:13.826 --> 03:44:18.288]  Now, listen, I have talked to psychological operations officers at NORTHCOM.
[03:44:18.288 --> 03:44:20.909]  Quote, unquote, there is nothing that hits the media.
[03:44:22.648 --> 03:44:23.308]  I don't know.
[03:44:37.954 --> 03:44:38.815]  Steve, we're losing you.
[03:44:38.815 --> 03:44:40.356]  Your phone volume's going up and down.
[03:44:40.356 --> 03:44:41.517]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:44:41.517 --> 03:44:42.458]  Is this better?
[03:44:42.458 --> 03:44:43.338]  Yeah.
[03:44:43.338 --> 03:44:44.659]  Yep.
[03:44:44.659 --> 03:44:50.004]  The situation that the news media always uses the same words, okay?
[03:44:50.004 --> 03:44:52.425]  The neuro-linguistic program repeated, repeated, repeated.
[03:44:52.425 --> 03:44:53.406]  No, it's all scripted.
[03:44:53.406 --> 03:44:54.627]  It's all scripted globally.
[03:44:54.627 --> 03:44:55.147]  You can tell.
[03:44:55.147 --> 03:44:55.568]  Exactly.
[03:44:56.152 --> 03:45:12.442]  Absolutely, so what I'm saying is the idea is that this is a, as everyone, this is just the carrier wave of the next wave to come, and the next wave to come is going to be very, very deadly and very, very dangerous, but that does not mean that this thing is dismissed.
[03:45:12.442 --> 03:45:16.845]  Listen, these guys test, test, test, and retest, okay?
[03:45:17.532 --> 03:45:28.799]  By selectively introducing a genetically altered virus and testing it on a specific subject group, they can tell if there's a natural resistance that they didn't anticipate.
[03:45:28.799 --> 03:45:32.262]  You see, Alex, 80% death isn't enough.
[03:45:32.262 --> 03:45:33.863]  90% certainly isn't good enough.
[03:45:33.863 --> 03:45:36.404]  They want 100% lethal dose or lethal kill rate.
[03:45:37.725 --> 03:45:41.767]  This is wargaming, the response, the propaganda, all of it.
[03:45:41.767 --> 03:45:42.988]  I agree, that's how they operate.
[03:45:42.988 --> 03:45:55.355]  And then you have, look, the final piece is Baxter, the company involved with Bayer, knowingly shipping out HIV and hepatitis to over a million people in the Factor VIII vaccines.
[03:45:55.355 --> 03:45:56.356]  That is on record.
[03:45:56.356 --> 03:45:57.236]  That is on record.
[03:45:57.236 --> 03:46:00.758]  You know, mainstream news, just Google Factor VIII, folks, it'll blow you away.
[03:46:00.758 --> 03:46:02.860]  MSNBC, AP, knowingly.
[03:46:02.860 --> 03:46:04.941]  And they just say, oh, we know and we did it, and they're still in business.
[03:46:05.601 --> 03:46:13.446]  Now they get caught mixing live bird flu with the vaccine stocks in Europe, and now the UN chooses them to make the vaccine for that.
[03:46:13.446 --> 03:46:18.509]  I mean, how would you trust these people to clean toilets, much less be making the vaccine?
[03:46:18.509 --> 03:46:30.076]  I wouldn't, but remember this, Janet Napolitano declared a health emergency, and remember, Alex, when you and I were beating the drum on them, what was it, the Medical Emergency Health Powers Act or something?
[03:46:30.076 --> 03:46:30.876]  MEPA?
[03:46:30.876 --> 03:46:31.537]  M-E-H-P-A?
[03:46:32.634 --> 03:46:35.016]  I think everybody better go Google that.
[03:46:35.016 --> 03:46:47.228]  And the thing is, I may have a couple of the initials backwards or something, but basically it gives, under a health emergency, this is the prima facie cause for the Declaration of Martial Law.
[03:46:47.228 --> 03:46:49.771]  You don't take the vaccine, you go into the camps.
[03:46:50.703 --> 03:46:53.605]  I'm telling you, this is... No, no, no, Steve, you're right.
[03:46:53.605 --> 03:46:59.729]  They have always drilled and trained on record that they're going to lock down, do forced inoculations.
[03:46:59.729 --> 03:47:01.310]  They've trained the clergy response teams.
[03:47:01.310 --> 03:47:06.714]  The first thing is tell the people what's of the Lord to take the shots, go to the camps to turn their guns in.
[03:47:06.714 --> 03:47:15.640]  They have drilled the whole martial law architecture, not around fighting Al Qaeda, but around confiscating guns during a breakdown of society, during forced inoculations.
[03:47:15.640 --> 03:47:18.642]  You are absolutely right, and I just hope this isn't the big one.
[03:47:19.212 --> 03:47:26.617]  Well, I believe it's a big one and you said it in a powerful statement, these doctors, especially the gentleman you're quoting in the University of Texas.
[03:47:26.617 --> 03:47:34.723]  Remember this, a doctor is trained with one twist of the scalpel one way to cure, with a twist of the scalpel the other way, it kills.
[03:47:35.283 --> 03:47:37.104]  And are he or they killed?
[03:47:37.104 --> 03:47:42.486]  Look at the greatest mass murders in history, Alex, and besides, of course, the Aztecs and others.
[03:47:42.486 --> 03:47:44.347]  But the thing is, is that they're doctors.
[03:47:44.347 --> 03:47:46.027]  Obviously, Dr. Mengele.
[03:47:46.027 --> 03:47:48.968]  Obviously, Dr. Ishii of World War II fame.
[03:47:48.968 --> 03:47:49.989]  And it's fascinating.
[03:47:49.989 --> 03:47:52.250]  We even take the higher-ups of Al-Qaeda.
[03:47:52.250 --> 03:47:53.170]  They're doctors.
[03:47:53.170 --> 03:47:54.551]  They're medical doctors.
[03:47:54.551 --> 03:48:00.533]  The point that I'm trying to make here is this, is that you have a group of sinister
[03:48:01.133 --> 03:48:02.994]  Well, they're Luciferian witch doctors!
[03:48:02.994 --> 03:48:04.895]  It goes back to their original calling, the Twin Snakes.
[03:48:19.600 --> 03:48:20.701]  Absolutely.
[03:48:20.701 --> 03:48:28.484]  And the point that people have to recognize is that if you don't act now, you'll be forced to react later.
[03:48:28.484 --> 03:48:32.366]  And I'm getting emails because I put out the red alert, or excuse me, orange alert.
[03:48:32.366 --> 03:48:34.227]  And by the way, can I make something clear?
[03:48:34.227 --> 03:48:40.590]  When I put out the red alert, and I don't know if you've heard about this, some people, I didn't call it that, but it'd be called the red screen of death.
[03:48:40.590 --> 03:48:43.372]  That means that you've got two weeks before the hammer falls.
[03:48:43.852 --> 03:48:45.393]  Don't dismiss my orange alert.
[03:48:45.393 --> 03:48:45.994]  It was right.
[03:48:45.994 --> 03:48:50.456]  I'm telling you, this weekend's going to get very, very problematic.
[03:48:50.456 --> 03:48:59.422]  And from that point forward, I can't say at what time, because I know the July date for the exercise of bringing in all the NATO troops.
[03:48:59.422 --> 03:49:04.166]  And Alex, no one will come clean with how many NATO troops are being brought into the country.
[03:49:04.166 --> 03:49:11.070]  Oh my gosh, I forgot they're having a huge NATO drill in Mexico and Arizona.
[03:49:11.070 --> 03:49:13.132]  They're having FEMA drills all over the country.
[03:49:14.072 --> 03:49:17.256]  There are no coincidences, Alex.
[03:49:17.256 --> 03:49:17.897]  Not in this world.
[03:49:17.897 --> 03:49:21.321]  Not in the world that you and I discuss, there are no coincidences.
[03:49:32.694 --> 03:49:35.176]  Well, certainly not in the world of politics, like Roosevelt said.
[03:49:35.176 --> 03:49:38.138]  If something happens, you can know it was planned that way in politics.
[03:49:38.138 --> 03:49:45.785]  And you put all of this together, it certainly is a very, very interesting time to be alive.
[03:49:45.785 --> 03:49:47.246]  Steve, I want to throw this out now.
[03:49:47.246 --> 03:49:51.610]  I have got a meeting I've got to go to in about 15 minutes after the show's over, but
[03:49:52.634 --> 03:49:55.095]  I promise to go to about 15 callers.
[03:49:55.095 --> 03:49:59.316]  If we give them each one minute when we come back, that would be 15 over into overdrive.
[03:49:59.316 --> 03:50:02.036]  Will you do a 15 minutes of overdrive with me?
[03:50:02.036 --> 03:50:04.717]  Sure, I'll do whatever you want, because it's that important, Alex.
[03:50:04.717 --> 03:50:07.098]  Listen, our days are numbered.
[03:50:07.098 --> 03:50:08.458]  Let me share this with you.
[03:50:08.458 --> 03:50:13.519]  Ladies and gentlemen, the warnings are only in effect until the events take place.
[03:50:13.519 --> 03:50:16.420]  When the events are taking place, the warnings cease.
[03:50:16.420 --> 03:50:17.980]  That's where I believe we are, Alex.
[03:50:17.980 --> 03:50:20.721]  We are now in the last bits of time.
[03:50:21.161 --> 03:50:30.876]  That the mercy of the God of Heaven is granting this nation to actually pleading with this nation through you, me, others that are warning, warning, warning, but the point is the warnings are over.
[03:50:30.876 --> 03:50:32.779]  It's now implementation time.
[03:50:32.779 --> 03:50:34.381]  They don't get any more time.
[03:50:34.381 --> 03:50:35.623]  We are out of time.
[03:50:35.623 --> 03:50:36.805]  It's in effect now.
[03:50:37.369 --> 03:51:01.554]  Well, Steve, I never heard you really talk like this, and just last week you said an orange alert, you know, in the next month they're going to drop the hammer, and I've never seen you do something like that, and that's why I had you on today, and I'm going from memory, but it was either on your show last Thursday, you know, Thursday before last, or that Monday, eight days ago, that you did talk about flu being the issue, so we're going to come back, take calls, go into overdrive, stay with us.
[03:51:02.765 --> 03:51:03.907]  You are a rebel.
[03:51:03.907 --> 03:51:04.648]  Admit it.
[03:51:04.648 --> 03:51:07.633]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[03:51:07.633 --> 03:51:10.017]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[03:51:10.017 --> 03:51:13.963]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[03:51:13.963 --> 03:51:16.007]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot.
[03:51:16.007 --> 03:51:17.429]  And you can count your real friends.
[03:51:19.684 --> 03:51:20.424]  I don't think so.
[03:51:50.993 --> 03:51:54.538]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.258 --> 03:52:14.142]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.142 --> 03:52:20.647]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.647 --> 03:52:22.608]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.608 --> 03:52:25.070]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.070 --> 03:52:35.978]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.251 --> 03:52:39.933]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.933 --> 03:52:41.795]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:41.795 --> 03:52:48.702]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.702 --> 03:52:56.971]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.971 --> 03:52:58.552]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.552 --> 03:52:59.734]  The people strike back.
[03:53:03.542 --> 03:53:08.045]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.

[03:54:11.288 --> 03:54:24.417]  I want to let you know about a few final sponsors before we end the main transmission and we'll go to internetonlyatprisonplanet.tv and for the tens of thousands of people listening on the free streams at infowars.com.
[03:54:24.417 --> 03:54:28.520]  We are number one on shoutcast now, basically all the time.
[03:54:28.520 --> 03:54:32.583]  Radio, music, talk, number one, period.
[03:54:32.583 --> 03:54:36.586]  And all of our streams don't even register on there, we're trying to figure out how to make them all show up.
[03:54:36.586 --> 03:54:38.908]  But really exciting and don't forget that we have
[03:54:40.683 --> 03:54:44.944]  Free podcast go to the Alex Jones Radio Show link at the top of InfoWars.com.
[03:54:44.944 --> 03:54:51.265]  There at the top tab by the Home and News and Multimedia links, Prison Planet Forum links, Shop links.
[03:54:51.265 --> 03:54:57.186]  You can click on Alex Jones Radio Show and subscribe to the free daily podcast for the four hours it's served out at the end of the show.
[03:54:57.186 --> 03:55:07.008]  We'll go back to Steve at SteveQuell.com spelled Q-U-A-Y-L-E in just a moment and take calls from the Genesis Board, Nathan, Leo, Bill, Dominic, JD.
[03:55:07.808 --> 03:55:16.053]  A few of those guys, we need to call our 1-800 number if we don't get to them so they can, you know, at least be on the other phone system where everybody else is holding over there.
[03:55:16.053 --> 03:55:16.493]  Poor Steve Quayle.
[03:55:16.493 --> 03:55:21.196]  I want to tell you about two sponsors first, though, before we go back to your calls.
[03:55:21.196 --> 03:55:25.099]  One of them is Ecola Blue, the best atmospheric water generator out there.
[03:55:25.099 --> 03:55:30.322]  Just a fabulous system with seven internal filters, a computer system, a great digital readout, 7.5 gallons a day.
[03:55:31.943 --> 03:55:34.705]  Seven filters including reverse osmosis and carbon.
[03:55:34.705 --> 03:55:35.725]  Simple to use.
[03:55:35.725 --> 03:55:37.266]  No chemicals, pollutants or toxins.
[03:55:37.266 --> 03:55:38.587]  Neutral pH.
[03:55:38.587 --> 03:55:41.128]  Own your own source of clean drinking water right out of the air.
[03:55:41.128 --> 03:55:42.329]  Ecoloblue.com.
[03:55:42.329 --> 03:55:44.290]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[03:55:44.290 --> 03:55:48.072]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com or 800-691-6043.
[03:55:48.072 --> 03:55:48.712]  1-800-691-6043.
[03:55:48.712 --> 03:55:57.497]  And last but not least, don't forget Max the Orange Home Gang Guerrilla on Infowars.com.
[03:55:57.497 --> 03:55:59.218]  There is a banner link to him.
[03:56:01.300 --> 03:56:03.821]  At Infowars.com.
[03:56:03.821 --> 03:56:05.882]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of the great sponsors again.
[03:56:05.882 --> 03:56:10.164]  HomeGain.com.
[03:56:10.164 --> 03:56:11.525]  HomeGain.com.
[03:56:11.525 --> 03:56:12.865]  Find out how much your house is worth.
[03:56:12.865 --> 03:56:13.366]  It's instant.
[03:56:13.366 --> 03:56:16.507]  It's free all over the country and North America.
[03:56:16.507 --> 03:56:25.951]  They also have a home sale maximizer that tells you the best ways to get basic improvements on your home that are inexpensive that will boost the sale of your home massively.
[03:56:25.951 --> 03:56:26.492]  HomeGain.com.
[03:56:27.632 --> 03:56:36.358]  Okay, let's take a few calls for Steve Quayle now from the Genesis Board, and then I want to give the folks, we probably won't get to Bill, Dominique, and JD.
[03:56:36.358 --> 03:56:38.840]  Only those guys can call this number right now, because others are on hold there.
[03:56:38.840 --> 03:56:46.926]  888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, and we'll go to you guys when the show ends and goes to internet only.
[03:56:46.926 --> 03:56:50.008]  888-201-2244, and everybody else that's holding.
[03:56:50.008 --> 03:56:55.372]  But right now, Nathan in New York, you're on the air with Steve Quayle, go ahead.
[03:56:55.372 --> 03:56:56.813]  Go ahead, Nathan, you're on the air.
[03:56:58.217 --> 03:56:58.897]  Okay, he's gone.
[03:56:58.897 --> 03:57:01.219]  Let's go to Leo in Missouri.
[03:57:01.219 --> 03:57:03.120]  Go ahead, or is it Montana?
[03:57:03.120 --> 03:57:04.481]  Leo, you're on the air.
[03:57:04.481 --> 03:57:05.021]  Hey, Alex.
[03:57:05.021 --> 03:57:06.642]  Hey, Steve.
[03:57:06.642 --> 03:57:08.923]  You guys stole a little bit of my thunder.
[03:57:08.923 --> 03:57:19.449]  I'm one of the guys that happens to think this may be real based on that 96 Air Force article that came out saying that 30 million people would be killed by the flu.
[03:57:19.449 --> 03:57:21.910]  And by the way, I dropped the ball on that.
[03:57:21.910 --> 03:57:23.491]  I meant to cover that at the start of the show.
[03:57:23.491 --> 03:57:24.432]  We go into overdrive.
[03:57:24.432 --> 03:57:26.093]  I'm going to cover that at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:26.093 --> 03:57:26.373]  Go ahead.
[03:57:26.920 --> 03:57:31.805]  Okay, and then the other reason I think it may be real is all these mass graves that are popping up.
[03:57:31.805 --> 03:57:33.987]  They're being dug for a reason.
[03:57:33.987 --> 03:57:37.230]  It's not just one of these things where... And by the way, that's not a rumor.
[03:57:37.230 --> 03:57:41.535]  I have the mainstream news articles and I have the executive orders right here.
[03:57:41.535 --> 03:57:46.079]  We're going to cover that too when we come back, where they are building mass graves.
[03:57:46.079 --> 03:57:49.222]  And they'll use a straw man grave that isn't real to discredit it.
[03:57:49.222 --> 03:57:49.703]  Steve Quayle.
[03:57:50.327 --> 03:57:51.128]  Well, absolutely.
[03:57:51.128 --> 03:57:52.609]  The caller is absolutely right.
[03:57:52.609 --> 03:57:55.511]  You know, Alex, how much more in our face does it have to be?
[03:57:55.511 --> 03:58:03.797]  And my answer to that is probably you have to be on your back with the last bits of life looking up at the dirt they're throwing in on you at the mass grave.
[03:58:03.797 --> 03:58:17.607]  This should really make most people infuriated that while we're talking on TalkRadar today on the 27th of April, the thing is that these people are planning the extinction and annihilation of a minimum of 30 million people.
[03:58:17.607 --> 03:58:18.748]  By the way, I don't want to make any
[03:58:19.128 --> 03:58:20.049]  Misconceptions.
[03:58:20.049 --> 03:58:21.409]  I believe this is it.
[03:58:21.409 --> 03:58:24.571]  I believe this is the match that has been lit.
[03:58:24.571 --> 03:58:25.431]  Alright, stay there Steve.
[03:58:25.431 --> 03:58:28.633]  We've been getting all perspectives and we appreciate yours and respect it.
[03:58:28.633 --> 03:58:31.755]  We're gonna call you back, Steve, at our phone system right now.
[03:58:31.755 --> 03:58:36.317]  We'll be back for everybody else in one minute on our phone system at 888-201-2244.
[03:58:36.317 --> 03:58:40.819]  We'll continue to cover this at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:58:40.819 --> 03:58:41.760]  Stay with us.
[03:58:41.760 --> 03:58:45.142]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.516 --> 03:58:51.679]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.679 --> 03:58:53.360]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.360 --> 03:58:58.103]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.103 --> 03:59:01.065]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.065 --> 03:59:04.107]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.107 --> 03:59:09.951]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.191 --> 03:59:13.433]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.433 --> 03:59:20.418]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:59:20.418 --> 03:59:23.700]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:59:23.700 --> 03:59:25.381]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[03:59:28.843 --> 03:59:30.183]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:59:57.799 --> 04:00:16.826]  Cats like me and you Have got loves That they adhere to
[04:00:28.739 --> 04:00:44.716]  Right now we're gonna do about 15-20 minutes of this to get to everybody's calls and we had to get Steve Quayle over from the Genesis phone system in Minnesota over to our studios here that we're developing and building and expanding, building TV studios right now as well.
[04:00:44.716 --> 04:00:46.298]  Do we have Steve Quayle on the horn yet?
[04:00:47.608 --> 04:00:49.230]  Okay, we're getting him right now.
[04:00:49.230 --> 04:00:52.072]  Let's go ahead and start taking calls now as we wait.
[04:00:52.072 --> 04:00:54.355]  Sherry in California, I appreciate you holding.
[04:00:54.355 --> 04:00:55.476]  Sherry, you're on the air.
[04:00:55.476 --> 04:00:56.397]  Hello?
[04:00:56.397 --> 04:00:57.438]  Yes.
[04:00:57.438 --> 04:00:59.199]  Wow, okay.
[04:00:59.199 --> 04:01:02.542]  Yeah, I want to know what it means by we have days and weeks.
[04:01:02.542 --> 04:01:04.825]  I didn't totally understand what that really means.
[04:01:07.461 --> 04:01:10.703]  When Steve Quayle was saying that, or when the media was saying that?
[04:01:10.703 --> 04:01:21.809]  Well, I mean, he's saying that, you know, if the globalists are launching their pandemic flu operation like they did in 1918, like they tried to do in 76, but people refused to take the shots because the first ones to take it got sick or died.
[04:01:21.809 --> 04:01:26.452]  I mean, we know the HPV Gardasil's killing a lot of the girls that take it.
[04:01:26.452 --> 04:01:28.313]  They're practicing just putting this out there.
[04:01:28.313 --> 04:01:32.596]  We get hurt, and then they act like it's no big deal, and they move forward.
[04:01:32.596 --> 04:01:33.496]  I don't know what's happening.
[04:01:33.496 --> 04:01:34.337]  You know, we had Sherry
[04:01:35.057 --> 04:01:35.857]  I hope you have Degalon again!
[04:01:51.414 --> 04:01:51.874]  Huh?
[04:01:51.874 --> 04:01:54.175]  I hope you have D go on again.
[04:01:54.175 --> 04:01:54.875]  No, I will.
[04:01:54.875 --> 04:02:00.898]  But then the head of Homeland Security comes out and says, yeah, this one will probably peter out, but the next one's going to be the big one.
[04:02:00.898 --> 04:02:01.638]  You got the U.N.
[04:02:01.638 --> 04:02:03.799]  saying billions will die for years from bird flu?
[04:02:03.799 --> 04:02:06.140]  I mean, the flu doesn't normally do that.
[04:02:06.140 --> 04:02:11.382]  So we're looking at what they're saying and saying these are eugenicist murderers.
[04:02:11.382 --> 04:02:12.863]  It's possible they could pull this.
[04:02:13.483 --> 04:02:16.665]  Uh, now Steve says he believes that they could be beta testing and this may be it.
[04:02:16.665 --> 04:02:17.426]  I don't know.
[04:02:17.426 --> 04:02:19.086]  But, uh, I appreciate your call.
[04:02:19.086 --> 04:02:20.908]  Steve Quayle, we just got him back online.
[04:02:20.908 --> 04:02:21.848]  He heard that.
[04:02:21.848 --> 04:02:25.350]  Steve, I mean, um, why just all of these pieces of the puzzle?
[04:02:25.350 --> 04:02:27.331]  You think they may be pulling something?
[04:02:27.331 --> 04:02:28.332]  Well, absolutely, Alex.
[04:02:28.332 --> 04:02:30.813]  I don't believe that this is the forerunner.
[04:02:30.813 --> 04:02:33.075]  We know that, obviously, the G20 met.
[04:02:33.075 --> 04:02:34.456]  We know the Bilderbergers met.
[04:02:34.456 --> 04:02:36.537]  We know that this was the year to go for it.
[04:02:37.037 --> 04:02:47.303]  The idea that Kissinger's statement that by September the guns will be called in, obviously you're going to need a mass event to basically begin the mass roundup and the mass assassinations.
[04:02:47.303 --> 04:02:55.667]  Again, I say to everyone out there that has had the census takers show up, Alex, can I just cover that just for one minute?
[04:02:55.667 --> 04:03:02.911]  I know people that were in the military, who were at some of these Tea Party rallies, I'm talking retired, who had census takers at
[04:03:04.892 --> 04:03:09.195]  No, that's been confirmed.
[04:03:09.195 --> 04:03:09.936]  That's been confirmed.
[04:03:09.936 --> 04:03:11.357]  The FBI was there.
[04:03:11.357 --> 04:03:15.400]  They now call their spies census takers, and we covered that in 2000.
[04:03:15.400 --> 04:03:21.584]  When I got the long form that supposedly only one in six got, all the other patriots I know that are prominent got the long form.
[04:03:21.584 --> 04:03:22.545]  Do you own guns?
[04:03:22.545 --> 04:03:23.766]  What are your stocks and bonds?
[04:03:23.766 --> 04:03:25.027]  Do you have a low flush toilet?
[04:03:25.447 --> 04:03:42.051]  You know, all of these questions and saying, by law, you've got to answer this, when the form had a line on it, only the little top part, it was all color of law, and yes, they're going to use the new census, they're saying it's going to be monthly, as their new little intelligence ops confirmed, with the GPS marking their houses.
[04:03:42.051 --> 04:03:45.232]  Yeah, this is... I mean, they're really trying to do a takeover here.
[04:03:45.706 --> 04:04:02.567]  Right, and everybody should know this, that one of my listeners, one of our mutual listeners, queried the census taker and they even shook their head and said, well this is weird, because they're giving us pre-selected addresses to verify that the people are using so-and-so at this address.
[04:04:02.907 --> 04:04:09.314]  The census taker volunteered the information saying, normally we just go and canvass everybody, but she said, this is weird.
[04:04:09.314 --> 04:04:10.415]  No, it's not weird.
[04:04:10.415 --> 04:04:11.176]  It's predetermined.
[04:04:11.176 --> 04:04:26.311]  Alex, the information that's gathered by the FBI and whoever that's out there, it's using the face recognition software, it's a satellite uplink, and then in real time, real time, not
[04:04:26.791 --> 04:04:37.520]  You know, later in the day or whatever, people are dispatched, the closest census, quote, and I call them scouts, okay, I'm calling them New World Order scouts, are dispatched to validate the address.
[04:04:37.520 --> 04:04:45.407]  People that have been out of the military, especially special forces, special operations, okay, Delta, Green Beret, you name it.
[04:04:45.407 --> 04:04:53.774]  Anybody that has an expertise is being physically located and they're building, they, the powers that be, are building a threat matrix.
[04:04:53.834 --> 04:04:58.896]  Now, you've been saying this for years, and I've had the documents, you've had them for years, people didn't, but never got big news.
[04:04:58.896 --> 04:05:19.242]  We now have all these federal training reports, not just the MIAC and others, saying veterans are the number one threat, gun owners, that people quote, buying guns and ammo are terrorists, and then, I didn't even get to this during the main show, I'm telling you, I'm dropping the ball, Obama pushing treaty to ban reloading, this is from Gun Owners of America, and the treaty says they will ban
[04:05:20.582 --> 04:05:33.756]  All private manufacture and reloading, even of factories, and we see the Army two months ago and the Armed Services saying we're not going to sell our bulk .308, .30-06, .223, 7.62, .39, and all these other ammos, .50 cal, to the private, even, you know, major corporate reloaders.
[04:05:41.204 --> 04:05:43.907]  And so this is confirmed up on Infowars.com.
[04:05:43.907 --> 04:05:46.410]  Directly from Gun Owners of America, Larry Pratt did a video on it.
[04:05:46.410 --> 04:05:47.351]  In fact, I kept forgetting.
[04:05:47.351 --> 04:05:48.913]  Let's get Larry Pratt on the next few days.
[04:05:48.913 --> 04:05:50.655]  Will you tell Rob Dufour I forget?
[04:05:50.655 --> 04:05:52.417]  Just a note, because I write over here and forget.
[04:05:52.417 --> 04:05:55.060]  I'm going to get him on tomorrow, in fact, as soon as we can.
[04:05:55.060 --> 04:05:56.822]  We got that hitting us.
[04:05:56.822 --> 04:05:57.303]  We've got...
[04:05:59.198 --> 04:06:02.079]  I mean, this is just incredible, all the things they're doing, Steve Quayle.
[04:06:02.079 --> 04:06:03.459]  Let's go to another call here.
[04:06:03.459 --> 04:06:05.900]  Let's talk to Dave in Ontario, Canada.
[04:06:05.900 --> 04:06:06.460]  Thanks for holding.
[04:06:06.460 --> 04:06:07.300]  You're a trooper.
[04:06:07.300 --> 04:06:08.400]  You're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[04:06:08.400 --> 04:06:09.041]  Go ahead.
[04:06:09.041 --> 04:06:10.401]  Well, thanks very much, Alex.
[04:06:10.401 --> 04:06:12.161]  Here I am in Ontario.
[04:06:12.161 --> 04:06:15.242]  I want to say something about TTV News yesterday.
[04:06:15.242 --> 04:06:19.724]  Now, you probably recognize Lloyd Robertson.
[04:06:19.724 --> 04:06:22.204]  Of course, Alex.
[04:06:22.204 --> 04:06:23.465]  Yes, yes, Steve.
[04:06:23.465 --> 04:06:24.825]  Hold on one second, Dave.
[04:06:25.684 --> 04:06:25.925]  Yep.
[04:06:25.925 --> 04:06:26.525]  Is he on?
[04:06:26.525 --> 04:06:28.007]  I'm sorry, I'm just hearing dead space.
[04:06:28.007 --> 04:06:29.568]  I just thought we got cut off or something.
[04:06:29.568 --> 04:06:31.130]  No, no, his audio is very low.
[04:06:31.130 --> 04:06:35.474]  I've told the guys that we're just getting our phone system here tweaked.
[04:06:35.474 --> 04:06:36.896]  Okay, Dave, speak up.
[04:06:36.896 --> 04:06:39.478]  Anyway, to continue... Can you hear him now, Steve?
[04:06:39.478 --> 04:06:39.959]  Not at all.
[04:06:42.335 --> 04:06:43.836]  Yeah.
[04:06:43.836 --> 04:06:44.736]  Okay.
[04:06:44.736 --> 04:06:46.697]  Listen, make your point and then I'll bring it up to Steve.
[04:06:46.697 --> 04:06:47.178]  Go ahead.
[04:06:47.178 --> 04:06:47.718]  Right.
[04:06:47.718 --> 04:07:00.945]  Now, yesterday, Lloyd Robertson appeared on the CTV Newsnet with a travel advisory from voyage.gc.ca, which is the Transport Canada thing.
[04:07:00.945 --> 04:07:07.229]  And he said, Canadians traveling to Mexico should exercise a high degree of caution due to occasional demonstrations and protests.
[04:07:07.229 --> 04:07:11.191]  And he went on to say, Canadians should be particularly vigilant in northern Mexico
[04:07:11.638 --> 04:07:17.442]  Because of the military and drug cartels, you could have shootouts.
[04:07:17.442 --> 04:07:19.403]  What a load of horse hockey!
[04:07:19.403 --> 04:07:20.063]  Come on!
[04:07:20.063 --> 04:07:21.204]  Yeah, let me comment on that.
[04:07:21.204 --> 04:07:34.672]  He's saying Transport Canada got up on TV and said, watch out when you go to Mexico because of the shootouts with the police and military, with the drug dealers, one and the same, two different drug gangs fighting, and because of demonstrations.
[04:07:34.672 --> 04:07:36.033]  And that's my issue.
[04:07:36.033 --> 04:07:39.676]  Mexico, and we had State Department experts on about this and others,
[04:07:40.436 --> 04:07:43.502]  Was set to probably be overthrown this summer.
[04:07:43.502 --> 04:07:44.744]  There was a good chance of it.
[04:07:44.744 --> 04:07:46.727]  I mean, rebellion nationwide.
[04:07:46.727 --> 04:07:52.317]  That's why I've had state senators on from Texas who are gearing up martial law on the Texas border, as you know, Steve.
[04:07:53.482 --> 04:08:05.771]  Could all this just be being used as hyping of just a flu, though we know it isn't just a regular flu, but you know, just hyping it, so the government can be the savior, so folks start worrying about their lives and stop worrying about the tyranny?
[04:08:05.771 --> 04:08:16.658]  Well, absolutely, because in essence, if people are getting too close to the truth, the thing you immediately do is you introduce another situation that takes their eyes off of the big picture.
[04:08:16.658 --> 04:08:19.720]  It's just like there's a movement out there to abolish the Fed.
[04:08:19.720 --> 04:08:20.801]  I got news for everybody.
[04:08:21.121 --> 04:08:22.501]  The Fed's already been abolished.
[04:08:22.501 --> 04:08:26.242]  It's now going to be called the International Monetary Authority.
[04:08:26.242 --> 04:08:28.043]  The big money has moved to the Far East.
[04:08:28.043 --> 04:08:29.183]  This is a setup, Alex.
[04:08:29.183 --> 04:08:30.443]  This is a total setup.
[04:08:30.443 --> 04:08:40.626]  So the thing that I think that most everyone must understand, that the International League could care less about nationalities, they could care less about loyalties.
[04:08:40.626 --> 04:08:45.027]  All they want is the raw material, and they're the pirates of the world at large.
[04:08:47.110 --> 04:08:50.675]  They use false patriotism to control us while they're busy destroying the nation.
[04:08:50.675 --> 04:08:54.180]  And then when you get their own secret documents, their real threat is the red, white, and blue.
[04:08:54.180 --> 04:08:56.683]  Thank you, caller, David, Ontario.
[04:08:56.683 --> 04:08:57.585]  Thank you, Carter.
[04:08:57.585 --> 04:08:58.987]  Thank you, Carter in Louisiana.
[04:08:58.987 --> 04:08:59.928]  You're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[04:08:59.928 --> 04:09:00.389]  Go ahead, Carter.
[04:09:00.689 --> 04:09:02.029]  Hey guys, thank you.
[04:09:02.029 --> 04:09:26.978]  Hey, uh, one thing I wanted to bring up, it's a little bit of my own analysis, I think you guys will see that this is probably true, they, uh, they see us reaching critical mass with the Tea Parties, conservative estimates with 2,000 parties with only 500 people, basically bringing the numbers to a million, but we know maybe probably one out of ten showed up, and then places like Atlanta and, you know, they had 40,000 people that showed up there.
[04:09:27.558 --> 04:09:42.323]  So what they know is I think that another brick in Steve's argument is why now is the time is because they realize they can't put the lid back on things if they don't usurp us now then they'll not have a chance in the future.
[04:09:42.523 --> 04:09:44.063]  Well, that's what I've been saying for months.
[04:09:44.063 --> 04:09:53.505]  The awakening to world government, the awakening to the New World Order, with them openly announcing it, then they need some crisis as they emerge to play the part of saviors.
[04:09:53.505 --> 04:10:00.186]  Attacking Iran, attacking Pakistan, further global financial plunge, staged terror attacks, bird flu.
[04:10:00.186 --> 04:10:01.847]  You know, I've said those are the cards.
[04:10:01.847 --> 04:10:07.788]  They can play one, two, three, four, five, six of the cards, or they can play none of the cards, but I don't see
[04:10:08.348 --> 04:10:10.891]  Then being able to move their agenda forward without a crisis.
[04:10:10.891 --> 04:10:17.819]  I don't know if this is the one, though, but they're sure hyping it, so we're here covering it, and I hope Steve is wrong about this, but I respect him.
[04:10:17.819 --> 04:10:19.401]  Steve, did you hear him?
[04:10:19.401 --> 04:10:26.310]  Yes, and the brick is absolutely correct, but I think we're, Alex, the thing, look, I pray
[04:10:27.010 --> 04:10:32.296]  With tears running down my cheeks that I'm wrong, but I know this sounds arrogant, but I'm not.
[04:10:32.296 --> 04:10:35.700]  The reason I'm not is because it's not just one event.
[04:10:35.700 --> 04:10:39.424]  The global collapse of the financial world at all is engineered.
[04:10:39.424 --> 04:10:41.025]  Remember this.
[04:10:41.025 --> 04:10:47.112]  The number one prime directive of the New World Order and all of its minions is order out of chaos.
[04:10:47.652 --> 04:10:47.792]  Hello?
[04:11:11.004 --> 04:11:13.726]  Yes, you know the thing is, I'm listening to the crisis.
[04:11:13.726 --> 04:11:20.890]  You know the thing is, I think we could deflect this if we could just get involved locally and deal with this locally at a local level.
[04:11:20.890 --> 04:11:21.170]  Wrong.
[04:11:22.768 --> 04:11:26.631]  I say that, I don't mean any disrespect to your caller, and I'll just get right to it.
[04:11:26.631 --> 04:11:31.996]  The situation is that the critical mass, Alex, is representing the Tea Party.
[04:11:31.996 --> 04:11:35.339]  We obviously saw the belittlement, the ridicule, etc.
[04:11:35.339 --> 04:11:37.901]  This is where the biological card is being played.
[04:11:37.901 --> 04:11:42.525]  Now look, when you win the game, you lay down all your cards at once, okay?
[04:11:42.525 --> 04:11:44.207]  We've seen cards being played.
[04:11:44.667 --> 04:11:46.629]  We've seen the vilification of the Patriots.
[04:11:46.629 --> 04:11:49.031]  We've seen anybody who's a Constitutionalist.
[04:11:49.031 --> 04:11:50.572]  You know, the whole list of DHS.
[04:11:50.572 --> 04:12:04.425]  And now, the last card in my mind that triggered this, which by the way, I said would be the case even ten years ago on talk radio, that the systematic elimination of returning veterans who could present a problem.
[04:12:04.425 --> 04:12:08.369]  I said they will be systematically isolated and terminated, okay?
[04:12:08.369 --> 04:12:09.590]  Well, then I was a crackpot.
[04:12:09.970 --> 04:12:15.852]  When that card was played, Alex, that's when the whole thing went into effect, in my opinion.
[04:12:15.852 --> 04:12:21.553]  Now, I really do believe that, you know, time is going to be very, very critical.
[04:12:21.553 --> 04:12:34.617]  And somebody just sent me an email saying, don't forget that I think April 30th is Walsh Purge's night, which is the second most satanic important date on the satanic ritual calendar.
[04:12:34.617 --> 04:12:36.017]  After Sam Hane or Salwin.
[04:12:36.577 --> 04:12:43.579]  Alright, thank you so much George.
[04:12:43.579 --> 04:12:47.820]  It does appear they're playing their cards, they're moving into high gear.
[04:12:47.820 --> 04:12:50.280]  Things are accelerating.
[04:12:50.280 --> 04:12:52.541]  And I've been telling folks we're entering the danger zone.
[04:12:52.541 --> 04:12:56.182]  I don't know if this is it, but we are in the danger zone.
[04:12:56.182 --> 04:12:58.342]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nathan in Texas.
[04:12:58.342 --> 04:13:00.022]  Nathan, you're on the air.
[04:13:00.022 --> 04:13:01.583]  Yes sir, this is Nathan.
[04:13:03.146 --> 04:13:22.303]  I have a question, earlier you talked about aspartame and how it was grown in vats and I'm a type 1 diabetic and my insulin is also grown in vats and in the United States they have banned pork and beef insulin which is extracted from
[04:13:23.340 --> 04:13:28.425]  That's right.
[04:13:28.425 --> 04:13:37.715]  They have pharmacological bacteria and crops that actually in the crops or in the bacteria secrete the insulin.
[04:13:37.715 --> 04:13:38.475]  I knew about that.
[04:13:38.475 --> 04:13:40.457]  And they also secrete the estrogen.
[04:13:40.457 --> 04:13:42.940]  When you hear it's synthetic, it's not really synthetic.
[04:13:42.940 --> 04:13:44.481]  It's coming from another organism.
[04:13:45.462 --> 04:14:00.837]  Just like they spray most of the meat you buy now so they can sell you rotten meat, in Latin it translates, the English translation is virus eating, bacteria eating virus.
[04:14:00.837 --> 04:14:04.280]  And they spray this liquid vaccine on most your meats.
[04:14:04.280 --> 04:14:06.362]  The problem is it's bred in tanks.
[04:14:06.983 --> 04:14:10.168]  That come from fetal tissue stock in many cases.
[04:14:10.168 --> 04:14:14.314]  So it's being grown in dead human stock in these giant tanks.
[04:14:14.314 --> 04:14:16.217]  Folks, you can't make this up.
[04:14:16.217 --> 04:14:17.919]  And then that's sprayed on your meat.
[04:14:17.919 --> 04:14:20.623]  I mean, Steve, again, who comes up with stuff like this?
[04:14:21.412 --> 04:14:24.775]  Uh, literally out of the cauldrons of hell.
[04:14:24.775 --> 04:14:31.501]  You know, Jesus made the statement that until he puts an end to the evil, there will be no end to the evil.
[04:14:31.501 --> 04:14:32.782]  And I want to share something.
[04:14:32.782 --> 04:14:40.189]  Well, these people are so absolutely ready to sacrifice nine-tenths of the world's planetary population
[04:14:40.729 --> 04:14:43.650]  I think people who are Christians have better realize this.
[04:14:43.650 --> 04:14:45.371]  They have got to stand up.
[04:14:45.371 --> 04:14:57.555]  They have got to take back the ground that they've given, because there's one thing more powerful than all the power of hell, and it's called the blood of Jesus, that simply means this, is that God is on his people's side.
[04:14:57.555 --> 04:15:06.298]  And Alex, what's strange to me is that the Christian churches that are rolling over for the New World Order, how can they prepare their people except to prepare them for slaughter?
[04:15:06.298 --> 04:15:07.758]  Well, they're bought and paid for.
[04:15:07.758 --> 04:15:10.179]  They're bought and paid for through the clergy response teams.
[04:15:10.419 --> 04:15:11.080]  Absolutely.
[04:15:11.080 --> 04:15:15.382]  So my inbox is filling up right now after your show.
[04:15:15.382 --> 04:15:21.367]  And I mean, the point is that during your show, and I'm sure it will fill up after the show, but that's what people have got to understand.
[04:15:21.367 --> 04:15:25.990]  I didn't mean to be controversial with the man, but it's too late to get involved locally.
[04:15:25.990 --> 04:15:26.510]  You know what?
[04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:30.233]  When I get an email that says, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, you know where that goes?
[04:15:30.233 --> 04:15:31.754]  It goes in my junk file.
[04:15:31.754 --> 04:15:34.536]  Because that usually means you do it, Alex, or Steve, you do it.
[04:15:34.536 --> 04:15:37.618]  Fortunately, there are people that are standing up with us, not behind us.
[04:15:37.998 --> 04:15:58.269]  But the point that has to be gotten of this is, ladies and gentlemen, based on the New World Orders timeline, based on everything getting ready to happen in the Middle East, getting everything that's going on in the world of economics, every area that you have known that was normal or you could trust in, it's being taken out from under you.
[04:15:58.269 --> 04:16:04.673]  And that's why I say this, that the only trust that you can have nowadays is to have a right relationship with the Living God.
[04:16:04.673 --> 04:16:06.114]  Alex, this is biblical
[04:16:06.354 --> 04:16:07.395]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[04:16:25.923 --> 04:16:28.666]  I've got a quick question and a quick comment.
[04:16:28.666 --> 04:16:44.098]  Quick question, I was wondering if you saw that the Obama legal team is pushing for the right for military recruiters to approach minors in California where a law was just passed that would prevent such from happening.
[04:16:44.358 --> 04:16:57.769]  Yeah, well, they've gone in and are brainwashing the kids in the schools, setting up, you know, recruiting in the schools, and they threaten them with arrest if they don't sign up for the military, telling them it's the law, and then the guys that get caught doing that get promoted.
[04:16:57.769 --> 04:17:06.776]  Also, the new head of the Department of Transportation is the head of MADD, and they want warrantless checkpoints, breathalyzers for everybody at checkpoints, no more Fourth Amendment.
[04:17:07.516 --> 04:17:09.598]  DNA testing on the side of the road.
[04:17:09.598 --> 04:17:10.900]  I mean, hell is being released.
[04:17:10.900 --> 04:17:13.843]  Everything Bush did is being expanded by Obama.
[04:17:13.843 --> 04:17:17.486]  You've got Obama zombies stumbling around, having no idea what's happening.
[04:17:17.486 --> 04:17:19.288]  Totally deceived.
[04:17:19.288 --> 04:17:21.751]  Again, Obama is their closer.
[04:17:21.751 --> 04:17:22.872]  I mean, I agree with Steve.
[04:17:22.872 --> 04:17:27.837]  The cards are being laid on the table right now, and it's just going to get more insane from here on out.
[04:17:27.837 --> 04:17:28.838]  But, anything else, Tom?
[04:17:29.885 --> 04:17:31.866]  Yeah, I just had one quick comment.
[04:17:31.866 --> 04:17:37.348]  I mean, absolutely no offense to anyone as far as they're religious, believe.
[04:17:37.348 --> 04:17:39.948]  Myself, I'm personally religious.
[04:17:39.948 --> 04:17:50.872]  But, you know, I'm completing my master's degree in political science and economics, and I've got a lot of friends at my university that I try to turn on to your show, but a lot of them just feel that
[04:17:51.664 --> 04:18:16.756]  There's a little bit too much religious doctrine being introduced in the sense of blood of Christ, this, Lucifer... Well, I mean, the issue here is that I have a news show, but I do have Christian guests on, and I don't censor what they say and do, and I think, you know, you've got all this humanist religion and environmental religion, it's just repackaged, being pushed everywhere, and all this Gaia stuff, and we've studied the New World Order, we know who they are, we know who their god is,
[04:18:17.276 --> 04:18:19.597]  And we're telling people the final level of this.
[04:18:19.597 --> 04:18:29.700]  Folks don't want to look at our track record, don't want to look at all the accurate things we've done here, and don't want to, you know, test their spirit, their instincts, their gut, you know, their sixth sense, then fine.
[04:18:29.700 --> 04:18:30.860]  But, you know, this is free speech.
[04:18:30.860 --> 04:18:32.941]  People are like, oh my God, Christian stuff, I don't want to hear it.
[04:18:32.941 --> 04:18:39.823]  Right, I want to address that, Alex, because first of all, this Christian, especially me now, he's taking a shot at me, so I want the right to respond, okay?
[04:18:39.823 --> 04:18:41.044]  Yeah, go ahead.
[04:18:41.044 --> 04:18:44.225]  The thing is, he's a political science major and an economics major,
[04:18:44.925 --> 04:18:48.468]  No offense, he sounds very young, but he hasn't been at this for 36 years.
[04:18:48.468 --> 04:18:51.610]  He doesn't have the track record, and I make no apologies for Jesus.
[04:18:51.610 --> 04:19:02.637]  These people are out worshipping Satan, putting pictures of the President of the United States up on the presidential seal with his arms outstretched and the crown of thorns on his head.
[04:19:02.637 --> 04:19:04.558]  The thing is, look, I make no apologies.
[04:19:04.558 --> 04:19:10.722]  This guy has nothing to offer, and quite candidly, I categorically reject his
[04:19:13.944 --> 04:19:21.690]  Well, let me just say this.
[04:19:21.690 --> 04:19:30.856]  I mean, when Obama goes to speak now at a university, in a church, they cover up Jesus in Latin like they're vampires or something.
[04:19:30.856 --> 04:19:34.399]  And I understand, sir, that you're saying... I mean, I actually understand what you're saying.
[04:19:34.399 --> 04:19:37.561]  There's people so afraid of hearing anything Christian that
[04:19:37.921 --> 04:19:46.485]  That you're trying to pass the show on to them, but they need to intellectually open up a little bit more and not be so scared of other ideas and other things.
[04:19:46.485 --> 04:19:54.490]  I mean, even though they hate Christians, why throw the baby out with the bathwater just because they're so afraid of hearing any of that?
[04:19:55.655 --> 04:20:03.362]  I guarantee if I talk to your friends who don't like this, they would say, I don't want to hear about Luciferianism and Bohemian Grove and the occult because that doesn't exist.
[04:20:03.362 --> 04:20:03.763]  No, no.
[04:20:03.763 --> 04:20:07.987]  Even if you don't believe in anything spiritual, the elites do.
[04:20:07.987 --> 04:20:12.891]  And from a sociological perspective, they are manifesting hell on earth because they believe in it.
[04:20:12.891 --> 04:20:13.412]  Go ahead, caller.
[04:20:15.404 --> 04:20:32.840]  I agree with you, like I said myself, you know, I'm religious personally, but all I was trying to say is I feel that sometimes you could more widely spread your image and maybe, you know, not scare people away if the religious overtones were just slightly turned down.
[04:20:32.840 --> 04:20:34.001]  Listen, I hear your point.
[04:20:34.001 --> 04:20:37.324]  I mean, I hear your point, but I'm on Steve McCommon, but I want to say this.
[04:20:37.324 --> 04:20:38.324]  We're not here, though,
[04:20:39.165 --> 04:20:42.047]  To tailor our message to try to reach as many people.
[04:20:42.047 --> 04:20:47.852]  We're here to tell what we believe is the truth, what we believe has been revealed, what we've learned, and we're not compromising.
[04:20:47.852 --> 04:20:48.673]  Steve?
[04:20:48.673 --> 04:20:50.815]  Religious is a wonderful buzzword.
[04:20:50.815 --> 04:20:51.875]  It is not religion.
[04:20:51.875 --> 04:20:53.056]  It is relationship.
[04:20:53.056 --> 04:20:54.037]  And here's the deal.
[04:20:54.037 --> 04:20:55.778]  Everybody quotes the book of Revelation.
[04:20:55.778 --> 04:20:58.220]  Everybody talks about all the prophecies.
[04:20:58.220 --> 04:21:02.144]  But when it comes to Jesus, and when it comes to anything, he's taboo, okay?
[04:21:02.144 --> 04:21:03.485]  But when it comes to Lucifer, Satanism,
[04:21:04.065 --> 04:21:07.988]  Anything goes except Jesus, and to that I categorically reject the argument.
[04:21:07.988 --> 04:21:09.770]  Alex, I'm just picking on the caller.
[04:21:09.770 --> 04:21:11.771]  I'm saying people that bring that up are religious.
[04:21:11.771 --> 04:21:12.792]  What does that mean?
[04:21:12.792 --> 04:21:15.194]  A satanist is religious.
[04:21:15.194 --> 04:21:17.856]  A child sacrificer is religious.
[04:21:17.856 --> 04:21:24.221]  So the point is that that is an argument thrown in to take away from the validity of our information.
[04:21:24.221 --> 04:21:26.923]  But I mean, Steve, look at all the occultism everywhere.
[04:21:26.923 --> 04:21:29.145]  Look at all the pyramids and all the Kabbalah.
[04:21:29.625 --> 04:21:36.590]  And I mean, the world is awash in occultism and Harry Potter, but then we talk about Christianity and it's like, ahhhh!
[04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:38.532]  And I'm not saying... I'm just going to say this.
[04:21:38.532 --> 04:21:40.994]  It is an invalid intellectual argument.
[04:21:40.994 --> 04:21:43.075]  It's nothing but a personal opinion.
[04:21:43.075 --> 04:21:49.960]  And again, I would hope for the gentleman's sake that he learns to turn religion into relationship and understand this.
[04:21:49.960 --> 04:21:51.201]  That is a far different cry.
[04:21:51.201 --> 04:21:53.163]  And Alex, I make no apologies for it.
[04:21:53.163 --> 04:21:53.483]  Listen.
[04:21:53.843 --> 04:21:56.947]  The people that have ears to hear are listening.
[04:21:56.947 --> 04:21:59.389]  The people that have eyes to see are seeing.
[04:21:59.389 --> 04:22:01.392]  The people that are ready to do are doing.
[04:22:01.392 --> 04:22:07.098]  And when you do what you do, and I do what I do, and people have done nothing, who say, well, you guys would have a bigger audience.
[04:22:07.098 --> 04:22:08.179]  I gotta tell you something.
[04:22:08.179 --> 04:22:11.904]  I'm only out to speak to those who have ears to hear and eyes to see.
[04:22:12.344 --> 04:22:19.751]  No, I hear you, but I understand you're rebuking the people that can't stand hearing the show.
[04:22:19.751 --> 04:22:25.896]  He was just mentioning what does he do about them, and my answer to them is they need to get a little bit thicker skin if it's so upsetting to them.
[04:22:25.896 --> 04:22:27.137]  But see, they're afraid.
[04:22:27.137 --> 04:22:28.599]  Something in them doesn't want them to hear this.
[04:22:29.579 --> 04:22:35.321]  Because they don't want to have to deal with God, or his demands, or his judgments.
[04:22:35.321 --> 04:22:36.821]  You cannot deal with that.
[04:22:36.821 --> 04:22:43.483]  Everybody says, God bless America, and you ask, okay, based on the nature of a living God, how can he bless evil?
[04:22:43.483 --> 04:22:49.965]  Because the only one that's promulgating or putting forth evil is Satan, so it's a contradictory mindset, in my opinion.
[04:22:50.365 --> 04:22:51.747]  Yeah, okay, let's go ahead.
[04:22:51.747 --> 04:22:55.191]  I mean, you can deny that God and the devil exist, folks.
[04:22:55.191 --> 04:22:57.493]  Okay, you can try to deny that all day.
[04:22:57.493 --> 04:23:00.998]  The issue is you can't deny that the world leaders are a bunch of Luciferians.
[04:23:00.998 --> 04:23:01.798]  That's a fact.
[04:23:01.798 --> 04:23:03.020]  Now, why is that?
[04:23:03.020 --> 04:23:04.381]  What are you going to do about it?
[04:23:04.381 --> 04:23:05.543]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[04:23:07.472 --> 04:23:08.653]  Bill in Connecticut.
[04:23:08.653 --> 04:23:09.454]  Bill, you're on the air.
[04:23:09.454 --> 04:23:10.274]  Go ahead.
[04:23:10.274 --> 04:23:11.415]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[04:23:11.415 --> 04:23:12.076]  Good.
[04:23:12.076 --> 04:23:12.816]  How you doing, Steve?
[04:23:12.816 --> 04:23:13.737]  God bless you, man.
[04:23:13.737 --> 04:23:14.177]  Thank you.
[04:23:14.177 --> 04:23:21.743]  Hey, uh, guys, you know, I know what you've been talking about all day here today, and that's all great, but I just wanted to throw this at you.
[04:23:21.743 --> 04:23:27.147]  Did you know that Air Force One buzzed downtown New York City this morning?
[04:23:27.147 --> 04:23:27.447]  Yeah.
[04:23:27.447 --> 04:23:29.569]  Mayor Bloomberg is flipping out.
[04:23:29.569 --> 04:23:33.172]  These guys had fighter jets and everything flying all around downtown Manhattan.
[04:23:33.172 --> 04:23:36.194]  Okay, and they thought that there was another terrorist attack on them.
[04:23:37.338 --> 04:23:39.660]  Can you think of the symbolism of that?
[04:23:39.660 --> 04:23:41.081]  Yeah, think of the symbolism of that.
[04:23:41.081 --> 04:23:43.262]  You've got Air Force One over the Statue of Liberty.
[04:23:43.262 --> 04:23:50.627]  I'm told by people that saw the event, caller, that the, you know, Air Force One literally flew over the Statue of Liberty.
[04:23:50.627 --> 04:23:56.752]  That, basically, that's a violation of the protocol of the New York airspace, but I guess if you're the commander-in-chief, you can do what you want.
[04:23:56.752 --> 04:24:05.158]  And then, meanwhile, you've got earthquakes, huge ones, and flu, and what is this where they freak out New York, buzzing downtown, right where the towers were?
[04:24:06.400 --> 04:24:07.981]  Well, I think it's important.
[04:24:07.981 --> 04:24:22.829]  The towers going down, and listen to this, Alex, on the largest area of, you know, real estate that has been the, where the, whether people want to admit it or not, there's the Mystery Babylon part of the Book of Revelations is still interesting.
[04:24:22.829 --> 04:24:27.192]  The kings of the earth commit fornication with this entity known as Mystery Babylon.
[04:24:27.572 --> 04:24:43.259]  I think it's fascinating now when you were talking, Alex, just moments ago about the religious, quote, images of Jesus being covered up, and in its place, the triangle with the luminous message that the face in the triangle is now the all-seeing eye.
[04:24:43.259 --> 04:24:50.222]  I think that what we're seeing is the announcement, and quite candidly, I think in occult terminology, I think this is what David Wilkerson is worried about.
[04:24:50.222 --> 04:24:52.303]  I think New York is going to get hit with such an incredible
[04:24:52.443 --> 04:25:05.375]  Incredible set of circumstances that the whole world is going to reel in revulsion and shock at what's going to get ready to happen to New York, and I'm not thinking it's that far off.
[04:25:05.375 --> 04:25:06.857]  What else was Bloomberg saying?
[04:25:06.857 --> 04:25:11.341]  I saw the report about the buzzing, but I didn't see much more than that.
[04:25:11.341 --> 04:25:13.283]  It just came in here.
[04:25:13.283 --> 04:25:14.444]  What specifically happened?
[04:25:15.387 --> 04:25:17.429]  Well, no, they had it on TV.
[04:25:17.429 --> 04:25:26.535]  Bloomberg, apparently afterwards they flipped out, but they had F-16s with, along with the Air Force One, flying around downtown.
[04:25:26.535 --> 04:25:33.660]  And people were flipping out and literally going out of the buildings, leaving the buildings, thinking that something else was going to happen.
[04:25:33.660 --> 04:25:35.582]  You know, that was the first thing this morning.
[04:25:35.582 --> 04:25:41.506]  Bloomberg flipped out and called a press conference pertaining to it.
[04:25:41.506 --> 04:25:43.748]  The White House sat there and said it was a photo op.
[04:25:44.802 --> 04:25:45.822]  I think so.
[04:26:05.600 --> 04:26:16.560]  I just thought that was very interesting, that you've got this stuff going on, these guys doing this whole thing, and I wanted to ask you, Steve, what do you think about Revelation 2 and 9?
[04:26:19.821 --> 04:26:20.421]  We're good.
[04:26:39.329 --> 04:26:40.010]  Let me say this.
[04:26:40.010 --> 04:26:40.890]  I gotta let Bill go.
[04:26:40.890 --> 04:26:42.791]  I don't have time to go to JD, Bob, and Eric.
[04:26:42.791 --> 04:26:45.533]  I apologize, but I've already done four and a half hours here.
[04:26:45.533 --> 04:26:47.614]  Or four hours, twenty-seven minutes to be technical.
[04:26:47.614 --> 04:26:48.675]  I've gotta go to a meeting.
[04:26:48.675 --> 04:26:50.256]  Gotta take care of stuff here at the office.
[04:26:50.256 --> 04:26:52.057]  Jason Bermas is coming back from New York today.
[04:26:52.057 --> 04:26:53.678]  He may be live tonight, nine to midnight.
[04:26:53.678 --> 04:26:54.839]  Probably is.
[04:26:54.839 --> 04:26:56.280]  I may pop in if that's the case.
[04:26:56.280 --> 04:26:58.101]  I'm gonna be down here anyways, nine to midnight.
[04:26:58.101 --> 04:26:59.042]  Central Standard Time.
[04:26:59.042 --> 04:27:00.823]  Steve Quayle, I know you've got your own show coming up.
[04:27:00.823 --> 04:27:04.085]  Steve, I want to thank you for spending so much time with us today.
[04:27:04.085 --> 04:27:07.007]  And let's get you to pop in throughout the week as things unfold, okay?
[04:27:07.327 --> 04:27:07.827]  Thank you, Alex.
[04:27:07.827 --> 04:27:15.172]  And again, watch Thursday through the week because obviously things are going to get very, very, very clear to a lot of people.
[04:27:15.172 --> 04:27:15.732]  Thank you, Alex.
[04:27:15.732 --> 04:27:16.232]  God bless you.
[04:27:16.232 --> 04:27:16.893]  SteamTrail.com.
[04:27:16.893 --> 04:27:17.293]  Thank you.
[04:27:17.293 --> 04:27:18.414]  Infowars.com.
[04:27:18.414 --> 04:27:19.795]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[04:27:19.795 --> 04:27:24.397]  We're going to cut back into our interview with Dr. Sherry Timpani from Mexico.
[04:27:24.397 --> 04:27:25.998]  A lot of key stuff covered.
[04:27:25.998 --> 04:27:31.642]  Coming up right now as we end this segment, going back into transmission and a break.
[04:27:31.642 --> 04:27:32.802]  So much is going on.
[04:27:32.802 --> 04:27:36.004]  I think this is all over hype, but maybe preparation for something else.
[04:27:36.004 --> 04:27:36.825]  But who knows?
[04:27:37.005 --> 04:27:38.766]  The governments are really active crazy.
[04:27:38.766 --> 04:27:41.828]  So we have a lot of different perspectives from all angles.
[04:27:41.828 --> 04:27:44.609]  You'll hear another one of those angles from this doctor right now.
[04:27:44.609 --> 04:27:47.751]  So again, please continue to spread the word about this show.
[04:27:47.751 --> 04:27:53.674]  I think we're giving you the biggest wide spectrum analysis where you can make your own decisions.
[04:27:53.674 --> 04:28:03.219]  You hear the whole spectrum of data so you can decide what you think is going on so we can take your calls, reintegrate that info and kind of have our own little think tanks here to understand what's happening.
[04:28:03.539 --> 04:28:05.820]  We have the power to defeat the New World Order.
[04:28:05.820 --> 04:28:08.341]  We can take action and get it done with God's help.
[04:28:08.341 --> 04:28:09.141]  Spread the word.
[04:28:09.141 --> 04:28:12.042]  Understand the globalists have staged terror attacks before.
[04:28:12.042 --> 04:28:13.522]  They are obsessed with bio-weapons.
[04:28:13.522 --> 04:28:16.123]  They did introduce cancer viruses and vaccines.
[04:28:16.123 --> 04:28:17.904]  And so they're capable of anything.
[04:28:17.904 --> 04:28:21.125]  That's why we're taking this so incredibly serious.
