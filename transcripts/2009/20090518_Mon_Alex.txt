[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:00.930]  We're good to go.
[00:00:32.673 --> 00:00:38.981]  Paul Dornanew, joining us from Europe, who was at Bilderberg 2009.
[00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:45.209]  He shot some of the great video of the secret police following a cameraman.
[00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:54.655]  When reporters at the 2007 Bilderberg Group meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, he got detained, saw many others arrested.
[00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.257]  He'll give us the latest on what happened over the weekend.
[00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:02.119]  And tomorrow we're going to have Charlie Skelton on who was detained again.
[00:01:03.752 --> 00:01:09.659]  Got in a physical altercation, got roughed up by these people, and was basically driven from the country, so that's coming up.
[00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:21.051]  Then next hour, I'm going to have Aaron Dykes in studio, David Gergen and others, Republicans as well, are involved in this AmeriCorps citizen army, and put up on screen
[00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:42.442]  The image of the uniform, it is a red and black, it's a red uniform trimmed in black with fascistic khaki brown shirts, and they're marching and doing military drills in this video, hundreds and hundreds of them, and they have tens of thousands nationwide, they want millions, and they say, this is our uniform, this is what we wear.
[00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:47.005]  And they admit it is with Homeland Security and they are spies.
[00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:48.195]  That's
[00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:13.236]  The legislation that Rahm Emanuel swore to introduce, we have the video posted right there so you can see it, and this will allow them secretly to ban any gun ownership they want, and then you can't challenge it.
[00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:15.356]  There's no court, you don't even know why you're on it.
[00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:18.597]  I mean, this is the hallmark, the bedrock of tyranny.
[00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:29.939]  So a detailed report on how that ties into the Cyber Bullying Act, restrict free speech, how it ties in to worldwide, how you'll have these tracking lists and not be able to travel, have a job, you name it, in the future.
[00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.199]  Before we go to Paul Dornanoo,
[00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.101]  Joining us, I don't know if he's gotten out of Greece yet, I know he started driving out today.
[00:02:37.542 --> 00:03:00.676]  Before we go back to, or go to our guest for the first time, I do want to take a few minutes out here as we start the simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv to just remind listeners that this radio show and the TV show and everything we do here is not inexpensive.
[00:03:01.892 --> 00:03:09.679]  And we're able to continue what we do and able to expand our key fight, the tip of the spear against the New World Order, who can deny we're at the tip of the spear, through your financial support.
[00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:19.287]  We're going to have a money bomb June 11th, and I would ask folks, we have, you know, once a year, this is the second annual money bomb, to expand the TV studios, to buy more cameras and computers.
[00:03:19.647 --> 00:03:21.569]  That sounds like a lot of money to try to raise $250,000.
[00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.253]  That is, that would be two cameras in a real studio.
[00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:34.612]  Okay, well we're talking about three or four cameras, a whole studio, more space, the equipment, one or two employees for the year.
[00:03:35.493 --> 00:03:44.099]  We need this money, so if you want to go ahead and donate at InfoWars.com, there's big banners to the money bomb, and we haven't added the new donations the last week.
[00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.779]  We'll do that.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.924]  It's over $15,000 just a few days into it, and then we're going to try to really have a lot of giving on the day of June 11th.
[00:03:53.098 --> 00:04:01.123]  And so that's coming up June 11th, but please check out InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or link through the banner at InfoWars.com today.
[00:04:01.483 --> 00:04:08.608]  Also, PrisonPlanet.tv members out there, you make this show possible.
[00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:14.592]  You make the simulcast, the TV production possible, the crew in there, and what we do.
[00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:16.953]  And you get all of my films in super high quality.
[00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:22.257]  We're going to release this presentation with Aaron Russo's last video interview that we did.
[00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:29.842]  And it has some added parts, the interview never before seen, and some behind-the-scenes interviews we did with him at a restaurant we went to.
[00:04:29.862 --> 00:04:36.009]  And also, I update the presentation with the latest video and information.
[00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:44.585]  And update the latest developments in the United States and the end the Fed movement that Aaron was instrumental in starting.
[00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:47.848]  So we commend him and Restore the Republic and everybody.
[00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.191]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, this presentation needs to be seen.
[00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:52.592]  It'll be shipping June 3rd.
[00:04:52.612 --> 00:04:54.994]  It's being mass-produced right now.
[00:04:55.515 --> 00:04:59.818]  And we'll have it by next week and have the orders packed up and ready to ship June 3rd.
[00:04:59.838 --> 00:05:01.340]  So get your orders in for that today.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.703]  Again, reflections and warnings and interview with Aaron Russo.
[00:05:05.084 --> 00:05:08.187]  Also, we have a new DVD arsenal every month.
[00:05:08.227 --> 00:05:17.777]  We take the best in-studio and other interviews and other extras and things we've done, like we're working on one right now that has all the Tent City interviews and things in it.
[00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.561]  We sent Cruz out to cover that.
[00:05:22.014 --> 00:05:22.874]  That's boiled down.
[00:05:22.914 --> 00:05:31.957]  The first in those monthly DVD Arsenal videos has been released and that can also be ordered at the secure shopping cart at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:05:31.977 --> 00:05:32.077]  888-253-3139.
[00:05:32.117 --> 00:05:33.897]  Then we have our big productions.
[00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.658]  We have our big productions that we do.
[00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:55.307]  Like Endgame, Terror Storm, Fabled Enemies, Truth Rising, and the newest one, The Obama Deception.
[00:05:55.627 --> 00:06:00.769]  The Obama Deception needs to be seen on high quality DVD and with the extras and things that are on it.
[00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.590]  So please order that at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.211]  And that's how you support this radio show and everything we do.
[00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.112]  Plus, you get a tool that will wake up conservatives and liberals.
[00:06:09.412 --> 00:06:12.153]  Liberals will watch it because they want to see how Obama's being criticized.
[00:06:12.493 --> 00:06:15.354]  Conservatives will watch it because they hate Obama and they'll see that it's really
[00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:23.465]  An attack on neocons and on fake liberals, controlled by the offshore power structure, and it covers the Bilderberg Group and what's really happening.
[00:06:23.505 --> 00:06:25.546]  So, such an essential film.
[00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:26.907]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:39.994]  Okay, that said, let's go to Paul Dornanew, who again, did work for us on the film Endgame, and he has pretty good English, better English than I have Romanian.
[00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:46.075]  And he again, this is his second Bilderberg that he's traveled to, and we really appreciate his courage.
[00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:50.136]  This year, it was reported by Jim Tucker, the worst security ever.
[00:06:50.417 --> 00:06:53.177]  Two and a half miles away, they were arresting people, detaining people.
[00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:57.478]  Secret police following everybody.
[00:06:57.518 --> 00:06:58.799]  Tucker said it was the worst he ever saw.
[00:06:59.818 --> 00:07:06.841]  Also, Charlie Skelton of The Guardian got arrested twice, detained another time, got roughed up by security.
[00:07:07.042 --> 00:07:08.822]  That's now headlines, The London Guardian.
[00:07:09.323 --> 00:07:11.063]  And he went there like this was all a big joke.
[00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:12.564]  But it's not a big joke now.
[00:07:12.624 --> 00:07:13.605]  He kind of had an awakening.
[00:07:14.385 --> 00:07:16.586]  And then, so we'll be going over that.
[00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:18.827]  Mr. Dornanoo, thank you for joining us.
[00:07:19.928 --> 00:07:20.428]  Hello, Alec.
[00:07:21.228 --> 00:07:21.889]  Good to have you on.
[00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:24.450]  Where are you now on the road?
[00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:27.050]  Actually, I'm at my home.
[00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.151]  I arrived this morning.
[00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:32.693]  It was a straight drive.
[00:07:32.713 --> 00:07:34.134]  So you're not that far from Greece.
[00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:37.756]  How long did it take you to get back to where you're from in Romania?
[00:07:38.536 --> 00:07:39.797]  About 15 hours.
[00:07:40.638 --> 00:07:40.978]  Okay.
[00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.520]  Okay, we'll start at the beginning.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.921]  I'm going to try to just sit back and have you break it down.
[00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:48.582]  What did you see?
[00:07:48.622 --> 00:07:49.423]  When did you arrive?
[00:07:49.483 --> 00:07:50.223]  What did you witness?
[00:07:50.543 --> 00:07:51.264]  What happened to you?
[00:07:52.625 --> 00:08:00.829]  Well, I arrived there for the evening with a friend of mine to help me with the footage.
[00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:02.149]  His name is Florian.
[00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:03.910]  Last name is Serbu.
[00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:15.155]  And basically what we noticed there from the beginning, and I have to agree completely with Jim Tucker, is that the security was
[00:08:16.658 --> 00:08:24.762]  Worse than I've seen in 2007 in Istanbul and what I've seen other times from other reports.
[00:08:25.283 --> 00:08:34.808]  Basically the police, I think the police took the job to secure the place and the army, the Greek army.
[00:08:35.668 --> 00:08:43.653]  I don't, haven't seen very much of special forces like I've seen before from maybe US military or something like that.
[00:08:44.181 --> 00:09:04.878]  But, uh, from the pictures I took, uh, I took, um, people to observe, um, for example, military on, uh, fast boats, uh, with guns, heavy guns, uh, uh, great, uh, military navy on the sea that was patrolling around the hotel, uh, police helicopter surveilling the area.
[00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:12.445]  When we arrived, uh, basically it was, uh, very animated, uh, and, uh, police, uh,
[00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:18.475]  Cars, police, bikes were coming and going everywhere.
[00:09:19.095 --> 00:09:22.397]  The traffic was restricted.
[00:09:22.517 --> 00:09:29.420]  So we basically went ahead and tried to see what's going on.
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.622]  And that's when we observed the pictures of the helicopter.
[00:09:35.462 --> 00:09:41.705]  That was the first day and we didn't... We later have seen a few limos.
[00:09:43.386 --> 00:09:49.830]  Black cars with black windows that were escorted by police.
[00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.051]  Was this last Wednesday?
[00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:53.813]  Thursday, actually.
[00:09:54.533 --> 00:09:55.214]  Okay, Thursday.
[00:09:55.234 --> 00:09:56.835]  So the first real day it kicks off.
[00:09:57.495 --> 00:09:59.997]  When did you start seeing them detain people?
[00:10:00.037 --> 00:10:05.160]  And then we heard there were some demonstrations that look staged by the communists and the nationalists.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:05.781]  Please continue.
[00:10:06.803 --> 00:10:31.345]  Well, my second day there, which is Friday the 15th, I was walking on the road, walking towards the Esquire Palace Hotel, and I met this guy, this Greek guy, I called his name, and he told us, guys, you know, that they are arresting people with cameras.
[00:10:31.877 --> 00:10:36.141]  And I said, well, I haven't heard that before.
[00:10:36.161 --> 00:10:43.827]  So we took a walk and we managed to take a picture of the hotel where two people were sitting in the balcony.
[00:10:44.628 --> 00:10:53.115]  And I went to change the lenses and get a bigger lens, a zoom lens, to get a closer picture with them.
[00:10:53.575 --> 00:10:55.077]  And as soon as I put my
[00:10:56.215 --> 00:11:05.420]  Now they advertise, Paul, and then we'll continue with the story, they advertise Greece as if it's part of the European Union, it's supposedly free,
[00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:35.814]  But clearly Bilderberg gave the order to stop any photos because they're tired of us showing the Queen of the Netherlands and David Rockefeller and British royalty and others being there.
[00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:40.298]  So, I mean, clearly this sounds like Soviet Russia during the 1980s.
[00:11:40.618 --> 00:11:41.218]  Please continue.
[00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:42.679]  Exactly.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:51.686]  Well, I think even personally to some of the cops in civilian or regular cops,
[00:11:52.250 --> 00:12:00.534]  And basically, what they told us is that, first of all, they were very friendly to us.
[00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:06.777]  Only some security people there were very, very angry, and they were giving orders.
[00:12:07.237 --> 00:12:09.998]  They had stations, radio stations, all of them.
[00:12:14.483 --> 00:12:25.599]  Oh, so you saw private security people, or what looked like plain clothes, private security men telling the police to be rougher with you?
[00:12:26.892 --> 00:12:27.852]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:12:28.453 --> 00:12:44.578]  Even when Richard Trabin from Ireland was arrested, basically he took a picture of such a man, and then that man ordered the police to get him.
[00:12:45.239 --> 00:12:48.240]  Okay, so clearly the Vildenberg security then
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:13:00.765]  Was giving orders to the police, and that's what we've heard from everybody, that the police didn't really like violating the press' rights, but were clearly under orders from higher up to do this.
[00:13:01.345 --> 00:13:09.709]  And so, go back over to the gentleman from Ireland, because we're going to be doing a story on this, Mr. Dornan, as you know, for PrisonPlanet.com, which has been the global leader.
[00:13:09.729 --> 00:13:14.531]  If you click under Google News, we're getting more hits right now on The Guardian and The New York Times.
[00:13:15.111 --> 00:13:18.372]  And others that have been in the Wall Street Journal that have been reporting on this.
[00:13:18.692 --> 00:13:19.892]  So it's important to get all the facts.
[00:13:20.932 --> 00:13:30.614]  So specifically, you're confirming Bilderberg was ordering people have their videotapes, their photos stolen.
[00:13:31.035 --> 00:13:40.217]  That allows civil action now against the private Bilderberg group based out of a private corporate office in the Netherlands.
[00:13:40.577 --> 00:13:41.457]  So please continue.
[00:13:42.483 --> 00:13:42.943]  Exactly.
[00:13:43.443 --> 00:13:47.004]  Well, I myself was detained two times.
[00:13:47.664 --> 00:13:50.365]  Actually, the second time was worse than the first time.
[00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:58.006]  The first time we got detained, me and my friend and that Greek guy, we were detained for about an hour.
[00:13:58.867 --> 00:14:05.088]  During that time, they probably launched some checks on us at the police station and then let us free.
[00:14:05.388 --> 00:14:09.889]  They didn't check our cameras or whatever we recorded.
[00:14:10.501 --> 00:14:36.477]  Now the second time was worse because it was yesterday when Bilderbergers started to leave and my friends started taking pictures with limos and basically they were all together in that park near the police barricade and they were friendly with us and
[00:14:38.208 --> 00:14:47.344]  Suddenly, it seems that this police guy dressed like normal people.
[00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:55.275]  He got radioed and got very angry because he was told to basically take us.
[00:14:55.655 --> 00:14:57.196]  And he came to us.
[00:14:57.336 --> 00:14:59.598]  He asked for our IDs and pulled out.
[00:14:59.678 --> 00:15:04.722]  He had to go to the police station and run some checks again on you.
[00:15:05.342 --> 00:15:06.103]  Let me stop you.
[00:15:06.804 --> 00:15:09.185]  Let's be specific, Mr. Dornan, because I want to get this right.
[00:15:09.866 --> 00:15:14.770]  You're saying the officers were being friendly to you and that he got irritated when he got the radio call.
[00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.573]  Was he irritated with you or irritated that they were ordering him to arrest you?
[00:15:19.153 --> 00:15:23.155]  The reason is that they get the warrant to arrest us.
[00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:24.735]  So they didn't want to arrest you?
[00:15:25.735 --> 00:15:26.136]  Exactly.
[00:15:26.456 --> 00:15:27.136]  Now let's be clear.
[00:15:27.196 --> 00:15:30.457]  The cops, when they falsely arrest you, always call it detaining.
[00:15:30.697 --> 00:15:35.419]  When you're stuck in a police car and taken, you were arrested without charge.
[00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:39.260]  You were arrested, falsely arrested, and then released without charge.
[00:15:39.941 --> 00:15:43.042]  So that's why they keep telling you, you were detained.
[00:15:43.502 --> 00:15:45.443]  Because they know what they've done is unlawful.
[00:15:46.323 --> 00:15:47.544]  And you have a claim against them.
[00:15:47.824 --> 00:15:52.266]  And even if the cops don't like it, there were lots of Germans who didn't like blowing people's heads off, but they still did it.
[00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:58.588]  You know, there were lots of folks who didn't like, you know, having, you know, to hang black runaway slaves, but they still hung them.
[00:15:59.008 --> 00:16:09.033]  And just because you don't like, you know, oh, I had to rob a bank, I was real sad about it, I don't like it, but I have to rob it, those police officers are not above the law.
[00:16:09.113 --> 00:16:09.273]  Now,
[00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:26.919]  More importantly, you and others that were arrested, including the Irishman and the Brent reporter for The Guardian, they need to file suit against the Bilderberg Group for soliciting your arrest.
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.061]  And then that will open all this up in court.
[00:16:30.342 --> 00:16:32.043]  We need to go after these bastards.
[00:16:32.083 --> 00:16:33.944]  Now, Mr. Dornan, please continue.
[00:16:34.645 --> 00:16:39.168]  Yes, I was considering doing such an action for us to talk with the
[00:16:40.123 --> 00:16:48.424]  The foreign minister in my country to ask them why I was detained or arrested at the time.
[00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:53.705]  Because the second time, well, I got released and I think that's what they wanted.
[00:16:53.725 --> 00:16:55.706]  Yeah, you were kidnapped, sir.
[00:16:55.746 --> 00:16:57.246]  You were in Shanghai.
[00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:58.166]  Four hours there.
[00:16:58.186 --> 00:16:59.306]  Four hours?
[00:17:00.167 --> 00:17:01.027]  Four hours there.
[00:17:01.327 --> 00:17:05.808]  Actually, we were in total of six people there.
[00:17:08.701 --> 00:17:11.565]  One guy, uh, hadn't had anything to do with us.
[00:17:11.986 --> 00:17:13.668]  He was an American from Colorado.
[00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:19.273]  And he was just sitting on the bank near us, and he was taken as well, even.
[00:17:19.394 --> 00:17:21.535]  Yeah, let's be clear, this is in the middle of a... Yeah, no camera.
[00:17:21.855 --> 00:17:23.676]  Yeah, exactly, this is a no camera.
[00:17:23.896 --> 00:17:37.065]  This is in the middle of just a gorgeous tourist area, and they shut down the entire palace with three huge hotels, and then there's a huge bay with boats and ships and people on the beach with volleyballs, and they were just grabbing people.
[00:17:38.606 --> 00:17:39.567]  Explain that to people.
[00:17:41.343 --> 00:17:41.723]  Exactly.
[00:17:41.783 --> 00:17:50.005]  So, well, basically, we're just standing there trying to take a picture with the cars that were passing by the limousines of Billaburger.
[00:17:50.526 --> 00:17:54.467]  And they came to us and told us that we need to go to the police.
[00:17:54.847 --> 00:17:55.707]  All right, stay there.
[00:17:55.747 --> 00:17:59.328]  But you're saying they also arrested just an American tourist who didn't have a camera?
[00:18:00.308 --> 00:18:00.728]  Exactly.
[00:18:00.928 --> 00:18:01.208]  Exactly.
[00:18:01.228 --> 00:18:03.669]  He was just guilty by association.
[00:18:03.689 --> 00:18:07.330]  He was just standing there without... Paul Dornanews, stay there.
[00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.110]  Paul, stay there.
[00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.031]  We'll be right back to you.
[00:18:09.351 --> 00:18:10.491]  Key information straight ahead.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.322]  Americans, do you know where your food comes from?
[00:18:13.743 --> 00:18:15.224]  Is it safe, secure, and healthy?
[00:18:15.664 --> 00:18:19.568]  Did you know most of our food is now contaminated with genetically modified ingredients?
[00:18:20.129 --> 00:18:28.517]  We at Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company have been helping people get pure garden seed for 12 years and carry over 1,200 varieties of GMO-free heirloom seed.
[00:18:29.158 --> 00:18:32.501]  Go to www.rareseeds.com for more information.
[00:18:32.962 --> 00:18:34.203]  That's rareseeds.com.
[00:18:35.037 --> 00:18:39.639]  Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company was started in 1998 by a 17-year-old as a hobby.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.041]  It was developed out of a passion for preserving our vegetable heritage.
[00:18:43.701 --> 00:18:49.785]  The company now offers the largest selection of pure heirloom seeds strived every year to bring back varieties like our forefathers grew.
[00:18:50.485 --> 00:18:53.967]  In times like these, we can't trust the government to keep our seeds safe.
[00:18:54.647 --> 00:18:58.449]  Every year at Baker Creek, we work to preserve the best of the oldest for future gardeners.
[00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:02.422]  We also offer affordable seed collections for long-term storage.
[00:19:02.843 --> 00:19:07.785]  Go to www.rareseeds.com and get your seeds from America's pure seed source.
[00:19:08.265 --> 00:19:09.806]  That's rareseeds.com.
[00:19:11.246 --> 00:19:16.569]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:19:17.069 --> 00:19:24.052]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:19:24.637 --> 00:19:30.818]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:19:31.219 --> 00:19:33.059]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:19:33.199 --> 00:19:35.600]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:46.642]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:19:47.262 --> 00:19:48.543]  It's not about left or right.
[00:19:48.943 --> 00:19:50.303]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:19:50.794 --> 00:19:57.160]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:20:05.967 --> 00:20:07.128]  The Obama Deception.
[00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:08.750]  The people strike back.
[00:20:10.788 --> 00:20:12.049]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:12.089 --> 00:20:17.451]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:20:17.671 --> 00:20:22.313]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:20:22.693 --> 00:20:27.755]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:20:28.275 --> 00:20:32.977]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:20:33.497 --> 00:20:35.358]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:20:35.802 --> 00:20:40.406]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:41.507]  And here's the best part.
[00:20:41.727 --> 00:20:44.469]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:20:44.489 --> 00:20:48.092]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:20:48.412 --> 00:20:51.254]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:51.595 --> 00:20:53.496]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:53.816 --> 00:20:54.757]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:20:54.777 --> 00:20:54.977]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:20:55.017 --> 00:20:56.078]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[00:21:04.915 --> 00:21:07.136]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:21:07.457 --> 00:21:09.898]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:21:17.283 --> 00:21:20.705]  We have a big announcement concerning YouTube censorship.
[00:21:22.266 --> 00:21:25.728]  And I'll say this, it looks very, very positive, but I don't want to declare victory yet.
[00:21:26.469 --> 00:21:27.990]  So that'll probably be in the next few days.
[00:21:40.303 --> 00:21:41.944]  Up on screen, it's coming up next hour.
[00:21:41.964 --> 00:21:44.305]  We're going to play this video.
[00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:46.166]  That is AmeriCorps.
[00:21:46.226 --> 00:21:47.867]  That is one of the uniforms.
[00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:54.751]  They've got ten different divisions of this, but that's the main political officer you're going to be seeing on the streets.
[00:21:54.771 --> 00:21:55.732]  In fact, they're on the streets.
[00:21:56.929 --> 00:22:02.454]  And they're chanting and doing military marches, and she looks at the camera and says, this is what I wear, this is my uniform.
[00:22:03.134 --> 00:22:04.055]  Very chilling.
[00:22:05.556 --> 00:22:06.978]  And they mean business, folks.
[00:22:07.058 --> 00:22:07.858]  They mean business.
[00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:08.859]  It's really sick.
[00:22:09.239 --> 00:22:12.242]  People can laugh at it, but they can call in the police on you, you name it.
[00:22:13.043 --> 00:22:15.124]  This is the new America, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:15.945 --> 00:22:17.326]  Arm patches and everything.
[00:22:18.447 --> 00:22:23.892]  I can't believe our republic's fallen this hard this fast, but we really are just a third world country.
[00:22:25.134 --> 00:22:28.636]  With some vestiges of freedom and liberty left, but that's all going to be overrun soon.
[00:22:29.657 --> 00:22:30.298]  God help us.
[00:22:30.378 --> 00:22:31.919]  And the yuppies are just going to roll over to it.
[00:22:32.579 --> 00:22:33.800]  They've had their fight sucked out.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.321]  A lot of folks, though, aren't.
[00:22:35.862 --> 00:22:37.483]  And that's why it's going to be very nasty.
[00:22:38.343 --> 00:22:39.924]  Going back to Paul Dornanoob.
[00:22:40.945 --> 00:22:52.630]  Infocon.ro, I-N-F-O-C-O-N-DOT-R-O, done a lot of great work, and you can see his footage in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement being followed by cars and police waiting out front in plainclothes, smoking cigarettes in alleys.
[00:22:53.010 --> 00:23:03.835]  Looks like something out of Indiana Jones or the Temple of, or Raiders of the Lost Dark, going through bazaars and trying to hide while guys follow him so Tucker can meet some guy in an alley to tell him what's going on from Bilderberg.
[00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.751]  And a lot of that went on this year, too, and Tucker's going to be back soon.
[00:23:07.771 --> 00:23:09.451]  He's getting back tonight.
[00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:12.672]  We'll have him on the next few days for a full debriefing here on air.
[00:23:12.712 --> 00:23:23.295]  But Mr. Dornan, the British reporter, Mr. Skelton, really got freaked out when they were at his hotel, in his room, following him, grabbing on him in alleyways.
[00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:29.197]  The London Guardian, he certainly had a conversion from laughing at us to taking this pretty serious.
[00:23:30.728 --> 00:23:42.100]  Yes, I've managed to meet Charles Shelton and talk to him a bit and he indeed was looking very frightened because of what was happening.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:49.427]  I don't think he was expecting for this to be happening and was taken by surprise.
[00:23:50.468 --> 00:23:54.192]  But let me tell you what happened the second arrest of us.
[00:23:54.887 --> 00:24:06.853]  Uh, when we got, uh, second time arrested with us, uh, there were, uh, two guys from American Free Press, uh, Bernard and Peter, I don't know their last names, and, uh... By the way, this is an exclusive.
[00:24:06.873 --> 00:24:08.194]  This is an exclusive.
[00:24:08.394 --> 00:24:10.795]  Nobody else is reporting right now on this.
[00:24:10.815 --> 00:24:12.736]  We need Paul Watson or Curt Nemo to get this up.
[00:24:13.017 --> 00:24:14.397]  A bunch of people were arrested.
[00:24:14.417 --> 00:24:14.757]  Go ahead.
[00:24:14.777 --> 00:24:15.438]  Go ahead.
[00:24:16.078 --> 00:24:21.341]  Okay, so, uh, uh, basically, uh, when they, uh, started to, uh,
[00:24:22.099 --> 00:24:24.440]  That's for our IDs.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.041]  We were in that park near the police bar gate.
[00:24:28.681 --> 00:24:34.402]  I started recording with my phone, just only audio, because I put the phone in my pocket.
[00:24:34.422 --> 00:24:40.184]  So I make sure I have some proof, something to give them if I have to.
[00:24:40.684 --> 00:24:42.524]  And they made you erase that, didn't they?
[00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:49.586]  Because you reported that to us in an email that I gave to Watson yesterday, that they erased a bunch of your tape and stuff.
[00:24:50.963 --> 00:24:56.644]  That one is still on my phone because I managed to remove the card from my phone.
[00:24:56.744 --> 00:24:58.665]  But they did erase some of your stuff, correct?
[00:24:59.045 --> 00:24:59.765]  Yes.
[00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:10.327]  When we got to the police station, the first thing, there was a captain which I managed to take his pictures at a demonstration a day earlier.
[00:25:10.347 --> 00:25:12.608]  He asked for our
[00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:15.742]  Oh, stay there!
[00:25:15.782 --> 00:25:16.062]  Stay there.

[00:27:06.143 --> 00:27:09.004]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:15.485 --> 00:27:16.145]  Big Brother.
[00:27:16.805 --> 00:27:17.865]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:18.566 --> 00:27:19.726]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:20.326 --> 00:27:21.146]  You want answers?
[00:27:21.906 --> 00:27:22.866]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:23.466 --> 00:27:27.207]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:27.647 --> 00:27:31.708]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:36.178 --> 00:27:41.682]  Paul Dornanew is our guest from Infocon.ro, joining us from Romania.
[00:27:41.722 --> 00:27:44.244]  Got back home in the last few hours.
[00:27:46.025 --> 00:27:47.966]  He was taken to the police station, arrested twice.
[00:27:48.046 --> 00:27:49.387]  The second time, very angry.
[00:27:49.888 --> 00:27:58.334]  They'd seen his YouTube videos that we posted that were actually carried by Google News as news and even posted on their front page.
[00:27:59.374 --> 00:28:01.276]  That's what automated computers can do.
[00:28:01.356 --> 00:28:03.938]  They can censor us with one hand and then elevate us with the other.
[00:28:07.031 --> 00:28:11.457]  It is amazing what the alternative media can do, thanks to Paul Dornanews, Courage, and many others.
[00:28:11.878 --> 00:28:22.512]  Okay, Paul, so you're saying this police officer, officer of officers, were you saying he was a captain or a sergeant, threatens you over the fact that you'd put him on YouTube.
[00:28:22.572 --> 00:28:23.133]  Please continue.
[00:28:24.451 --> 00:28:37.289]  Uh, he was very angry that I put those videos on YouTube, especially the ones on which you can see the faces of the... Well, let's make them more angry.
[00:28:37.349 --> 00:28:38.491]  Let's make them more angry.
[00:28:38.691 --> 00:28:39.512]  Do you have his name?
[00:28:41.168 --> 00:28:47.790]  No, I don't have his name, but I have a picture of him on the day earlier when the protest.
[00:28:48.671 --> 00:28:50.211]  Well, send us who this thug is.
[00:28:50.231 --> 00:28:51.352]  We want to put that in the article.
[00:28:52.012 --> 00:28:52.812]  So he threatened you.
[00:28:53.032 --> 00:28:54.193]  What did he say when he threatened you?
[00:28:55.193 --> 00:29:05.577]  Well, he kept asking me why I put this on the internet, why I have recorded that video inside a police station, and I denied all the time that I
[00:29:06.638 --> 00:29:07.599]  Recorded a video.
[00:29:07.659 --> 00:29:11.282]  I just said that I only uploaded it to the YouTube.
[00:29:11.762 --> 00:29:13.003]  I got it from somebody else.
[00:29:13.464 --> 00:29:14.745]  I kept denying all the time.
[00:29:15.625 --> 00:29:30.858]  And, uh, and, uh, they said, well, uh, we have to, uh, uh, take you into the jail and, uh, send you to a car court where a judge will, uh, will decide, uh, what we're going to do with you.
[00:29:32.666 --> 00:29:36.087]  And after that, they started to do a body search on us.
[00:29:36.188 --> 00:29:44.711]  They had to remove our shoes, got everything, whatever we had on us, taken away.
[00:29:45.451 --> 00:29:57.096]  And I feel that they were looking for something else, like maybe, you know, knife, fork, drug, something to get us, to stage us.
[00:29:57.782 --> 00:30:01.205]  Probably that's what they really are looking for.
[00:30:01.225 --> 00:30:12.453]  And after that, they put the batteries back into the cameras and the tapes, and they had us show them what we filmed, what pictures we have taken of.
[00:30:16.944 --> 00:30:19.285]  How are you going to recover it?
[00:30:19.325 --> 00:30:22.147]  You've got some special software?
[00:30:22.267 --> 00:30:23.888]  Or had you saved it at the hotel?
[00:30:45.521 --> 00:30:52.344]  After, uh, to cover, uh, erase formats, uh, cards, I haven't wrote anything on it, so it can be done.
[00:30:52.365 --> 00:30:55.406]  Um, I'll try that tonight.
[00:30:56.206 --> 00:31:04.451]  But, uh, more important is that, uh, they had me also, uh, destroy the tape I had in my video camera.
[00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:10.274]  I had more than, uh, 40 minutes recorded on that tape, and they didn't want, uh, them to do it.
[00:31:10.414 --> 00:31:14.956]  They wanted me to do it by myself, with my hands, and then, so it's fresh.
[00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:24.638]  So that left for about four hours.
[00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:35.262]  Other two guys, two policemen, higher in rank, I think, came to us and asked some questions about us.
[00:31:36.421 --> 00:31:44.567]  Yeah, implying you're a criminal so they morally can feel good about themselves, when really they're protecting criminals.
[00:31:44.667 --> 00:31:46.228]  You're alternative media.
[00:31:46.248 --> 00:31:50.932]  They're documenting world leaders, the bankers that have robbed us blind.
[00:32:02.381 --> 00:32:05.862]  Paul Dornanew, joining us from Romania, who just covered Bilderberg 2009.
[00:32:05.922 --> 00:32:06.242]  Stay there.
[00:32:06.262 --> 00:32:08.243]  A few more minutes with you, then I'm going to shift gears.
[00:32:08.323 --> 00:32:08.863]  Stay with us.
[00:32:10.863 --> 00:32:11.443]  Hello, friends.
[00:32:11.483 --> 00:32:12.424]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:32:12.544 --> 00:32:17.145]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:32:17.285 --> 00:32:20.066]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:32:20.246 --> 00:32:23.107]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:32:23.307 --> 00:32:28.028]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:32:28.248 --> 00:32:29.169]  If you simply prepare.
[00:32:29.369 --> 00:32:32.391]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:32:32.612 --> 00:32:39.517]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:32:39.597 --> 00:32:42.740]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.080]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.761]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:48.084 --> 00:32:49.645]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.833]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:33:17.333 --> 00:33:24.322]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:33:24.927 --> 00:33:31.090]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:33.332]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:33:33.472 --> 00:33:35.893]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:33:35.973 --> 00:33:46.939]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:33:47.558 --> 00:33:48.840]  It's not about left or right.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.622]  It's about a one world government.
[00:33:51.082 --> 00:33:57.429]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:05.799]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:06.259 --> 00:34:07.421]  The Obama Deception.
[00:34:07.841 --> 00:34:09.023]  The people strike back.
[00:34:10.976 --> 00:34:11.517]  You worry.
[00:34:11.677 --> 00:34:13.739]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:34:14.019 --> 00:34:14.299]  Hi.
[00:34:14.579 --> 00:34:17.042]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:34:17.362 --> 00:34:21.606]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:34:21.906 --> 00:34:24.088]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:34:24.368 --> 00:34:27.411]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:34:27.711 --> 00:34:29.433]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[00:34:29.653 --> 00:34:32.176]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:35.861]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[00:34:36.161 --> 00:34:40.266]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[00:34:40.566 --> 00:34:44.311]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[00:34:44.651 --> 00:34:50.658]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[00:34:50.998 --> 00:34:53.140]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:55.022]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[00:34:55.463 --> 00:34:59.668]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:35:00.128 --> 00:35:00.769]  Start now.
[00:35:01.029 --> 00:35:02.010]  Knowledge is power.
[00:35:02.751 --> 00:35:03.552]  Better take action.
[00:35:03.752 --> 00:35:04.713]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:35:11.511 --> 00:35:13.693]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:35:14.253 --> 00:35:17.136]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:27.184 --> 00:35:30.226]  Okay, very important report coming up.
[00:35:33.248 --> 00:35:34.930]  In just a few minutes I'm going to detail
[00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:40.524]  The just off-the-chart attacks on liberty and freedom that are going on.
[00:35:40.584 --> 00:35:42.265]  Bills introduced to ban free speech.
[00:35:42.865 --> 00:35:45.927]  Bills introduced to ban guns at will, to ban gun owners.
[00:35:46.467 --> 00:35:48.929]  But how this ties into a bigger picture of control.
[00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.351]  These tracking and tracing lists.
[00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:55.473]  For travel, for buying, for selling, for having jobs, that's coming up.
[00:35:56.414 --> 00:35:58.896]  But right now, let's go back to Paul Dornanew of Infocon.
[00:36:00.166 --> 00:36:01.208]  We're good to go.
[00:36:14.622 --> 00:36:15.723]  Was in Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:36:15.763 --> 00:36:18.845]  We were bullhorning them from less than 50 yards away, their main conference hall.
[00:36:19.485 --> 00:36:24.908]  Because most of the conference hall, the facility was 100, 200, 300 yards away from the road.
[00:36:25.168 --> 00:36:33.033]  But the one area where the conference room backed up on a side road, public sidewalk, you were like 35 yards away.
[00:36:33.093 --> 00:36:35.094]  And Richard N. Haas came out and was angry.
[00:36:35.114 --> 00:36:36.175]  The head of the CFR.
[00:36:36.795 --> 00:36:38.657]  I mean, the security was just breathing heavy.
[00:36:39.557 --> 00:36:47.843]  They had Secret Service just literally just going, ugh, looking at us with hatred because they told them don't arrest these people because it'll end up being news coverage.
[00:36:48.744 --> 00:36:50.606]  Because it was a total blackout in the U.S.
[00:36:50.646 --> 00:36:52.927]  Well, they've changed the rules 2009.
[00:36:53.188 --> 00:36:56.250]  Now they did have me arrested when I went to Canada.
[00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.211]  They pulled me off and said, what are you coming to do at the conference?
[00:36:58.231 --> 00:36:59.112]  Are you planning violence?
[00:36:59.633 --> 00:37:00.813]  And I said, no, I'm a nonviolent guy.
[00:37:00.833 --> 00:37:01.354]  Everybody knows that.
[00:37:01.374 --> 00:37:02.515]  I'm here to cover the world elite.
[00:37:03.826 --> 00:37:07.588]  And, uh, they said, oh, no you're not, you're trying to bring porn into Canada.
[00:37:08.048 --> 00:37:09.209]  And I said, excuse me?
[00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.851]  They said, yep, we find one thing on your computer, a pinup girl.
[00:37:13.311 --> 00:37:14.152]  You're going to prison.
[00:37:14.492 --> 00:37:17.174]  And they would smile and laugh and strut around in black uniforms.
[00:37:17.454 --> 00:37:22.397]  They wore like these black vests, armored vests over gray, and they would get off on it.
[00:37:22.417 --> 00:37:24.538]  I was like, you're actually getting off on this, aren't you?
[00:37:24.938 --> 00:37:26.079]  You're actually feeding right now.
[00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:26.939]  And they would get so mad.
[00:37:26.959 --> 00:37:29.961]  I would go, man, it must be a pathetic job to be you.
[00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:31.922]  I kind of enjoyed it for a while.
[00:37:33.854 --> 00:37:39.879]  And they were so angry, I mean they were so angry because they told us no cell phone calls and they took our cell phones and stuff.
[00:37:40.419 --> 00:37:50.907]  But Slick Highs, no it was Aaron Dykes had his little bitty cell phone, little bitty grey cell phone, we actually lost it at Bilderberg 2009, I forgot about that.
[00:37:52.268 --> 00:37:53.449]  But that was a year later.
[00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:55.767]  I have a family.
[00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:57.788]  I have a daughter.
[00:38:18.209 --> 00:38:19.411]  And he's got a French accent.
[00:38:19.451 --> 00:38:21.473]  He's like, I don't want to lose my job.
[00:38:22.134 --> 00:38:26.159]  We have a deal that you're going to be nice about this, aren't you?
[00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:27.781]  And I said, well, I'm going to talk about what happened.
[00:38:27.801 --> 00:38:29.864]  But, you know, I just want to get out of here.
[00:38:30.545 --> 00:38:31.706]  And I said, but.
[00:38:33.971 --> 00:38:35.993]  And he goes, you promise not to talk to the press about this?
[00:38:36.333 --> 00:38:38.555]  Which was immoral, what he was doing, because I just lied.
[00:38:38.575 --> 00:38:49.744]  I mean, in an emergency situation, when I'm with feds in a foreign country, telling me that I don't have a free speech and I'll promise to shut up, oh yes, oh I promise I'm not going to talk about this.
[00:38:52.566 --> 00:38:54.428]  As soon as I was out of Canada, I did though.
[00:38:55.209 --> 00:38:57.631]  I mean, because this is warfare, folks.
[00:38:58.819 --> 00:39:05.465]  Uh, you know, when you're behind bars and they're asking you to promise to waive your rights, I, uh, but I knew he was going to release me anyways.
[00:39:05.826 --> 00:39:12.532]  I mean, I didn't want him to taser me to death or do the other stuff that, uh, Canadian Customs is well known for murdering people in full view of cameras.
[00:39:13.292 --> 00:39:13.893]  I'm not kidding.
[00:39:13.953 --> 00:39:16.736]  So I, um, I told him, oh yes, I promise.
[00:39:17.156 --> 00:39:24.663]  One of the few times I lie, I'm pretty much trained to never lie, but I guess in the Bible, you know, when they, uh, have the spies going into the city,
[00:39:25.913 --> 00:39:26.634]  Was that with Gideon?
[00:39:26.654 --> 00:39:27.414]  What story was that?
[00:39:27.534 --> 00:39:35.100]  And they had the, you know, ladies in the... It was actually the prostitutes, and they reported, you know, that, you know, they lied.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:40.345]  I mean, I guess if I was in, like, a Nazi Germany and they came and they said, are you Jewish?
[00:39:40.525 --> 00:39:41.386]  And I was Jewish.
[00:39:41.826 --> 00:39:43.387]  Then I would say, no, I'm not Jewish.
[00:39:43.427 --> 00:39:44.708]  And I guess I'd go to hell for that.
[00:39:45.149 --> 00:39:45.889]  But whatever.
[00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.451]  Let's go back to Paul Dornanoob.
[00:39:49.352 --> 00:39:52.234]  Paul, you are on the air, sir.
[00:39:52.575 --> 00:39:54.416]  Anything else you want to add about how this went?
[00:39:54.716 --> 00:39:55.397]  So they're threatening you.
[00:39:55.417 --> 00:39:56.838]  They said, we're going to bring you before a judge.
[00:39:57.238 --> 00:39:58.159]  What happened after that?
[00:39:58.379 --> 00:40:00.141]  What about being followed, secret police?
[00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:01.622]  What did you witness on that front?
[00:40:01.662 --> 00:40:04.084]  What happened to the Irish guy that got arrested?
[00:40:04.464 --> 00:40:05.505]  Anything else you haven't covered?
[00:40:06.673 --> 00:40:10.536]  Well, uh, there are lots of things to be said still.
[00:40:10.596 --> 00:40:18.142]  Like, for example, there were other police officers higher in rank who came to us and interrogated us, asking questions.
[00:40:18.202 --> 00:40:26.689]  One of them was asking me directly if I'm stupid and if he's stupid, if he, like, looks like a stupid.
[00:40:28.156 --> 00:40:34.580]  And he kept asking me if it's legal in my country to take pictures of cops.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.642]  And I said yes, it's legal to take pictures of cops in my country, Romania, even with hidden cameras.
[00:40:41.483 --> 00:40:45.505]  Because that's why they were so obsessed.
[00:40:45.685 --> 00:40:50.067]  So in the end, another security guy came.
[00:40:52.423 --> 00:40:53.083]  Yes, we should.
[00:41:02.751 --> 00:41:12.980]  That they've got cameras surveilling us, they watch us, they listen to us without warrants illegally, and then they're out guarding criminals at the side of a beach resort and you're not supposed to show them?
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.062]  And the cops do that here too, they say, don't tape me.
[00:41:16.362 --> 00:41:18.704]  You're not God, you're not above the law.
[00:41:19.085 --> 00:41:25.050]  And don't you police understand it's the Bill of Rights and Constitution protecting your wealth, your name, your family's future.
[00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:29.714]  Don't you guys get off your little thumb-sucking, feelin' sorry for yourself power trips.
[00:41:30.214 --> 00:41:32.557]  So now, more high-level guys come.
[00:41:32.597 --> 00:41:33.317]  What happens next?
[00:41:35.279 --> 00:41:42.067]  Okay, so basically we were, after four hours, we were released by a guy dressed to be young.
[00:41:42.928 --> 00:41:44.890]  But I think it was a security guy.
[00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.211]  I don't know.
[00:41:47.092 --> 00:41:47.653]  Something like that.
[00:41:47.853 --> 00:41:51.657]  Security staff or something like that.
[00:41:52.205 --> 00:42:00.311]  And uh... when we left we noticed that much of the police went away so we realized the party was over.
[00:42:00.331 --> 00:42:03.753]  Most of the billboards have left already.
[00:42:03.773 --> 00:42:08.517]  So they detained us not to be able to take pictures of the cars leaving.
[00:42:09.958 --> 00:42:19.524]  And I think the most important thing you've talked about here is that your free speech was violated, European Union laws were violated, but we know they're written to do that, and
[00:42:20.606 --> 00:42:24.829]  They were doing this under orders of Bilderberg Security, which you witnessed.
[00:42:25.269 --> 00:42:28.552]  And it was also Navy and Marines there, according to the mainstream news.
[00:42:29.012 --> 00:42:31.834]  Navy and Marines, and reportedly Army.
[00:42:33.035 --> 00:42:36.177]  So this is a big deal, and we appreciate your courage.
[00:42:37.518 --> 00:42:47.145]  I managed to take a lot of pictures with, actually put them on a website where I gave you the link, with security on the scene.
[00:42:48.208 --> 00:42:53.191]  Paul Dornan, if anything else you'd like to add from Romania?
[00:43:10.905 --> 00:43:16.053]  Well, uh, I don't know, uh, I'll try to gather my thoughts because I'm, uh, very tired.
[00:43:16.133 --> 00:43:19.999]  I only slept, uh, half an hour, uh, since, uh, yesterday morning.
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:24.226]  And, uh, I still have things to do, uh, like another month or so.
[00:43:24.987 --> 00:43:25.688]  We'll see.
[00:43:25.748 --> 00:43:29.853]  You're doing your job, and you got inspired by other info warriors.
[00:43:43.991 --> 00:43:44.171]  I think?
[00:44:02.362 --> 00:44:07.707]  And so you are just doing a better and better job and growing and growing, Paul Dornanew.
[00:44:08.107 --> 00:44:12.191]  And we just really appreciate all the great work you do and we appreciate our relationship with you.
[00:44:12.551 --> 00:44:15.454]  So God bless you and we are very thankful for your courage.
[00:44:16.635 --> 00:44:19.597]  Thank you too, Alex, and hope to hear you soon.
[00:44:20.738 --> 00:44:21.639]  All right, sir, take care.
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.881]  What an amazing story.
[00:44:25.836 --> 00:44:38.145]  And we've got Paul Dornanoo created a YouTube channel and he's got some of the photos that he took.
[00:44:38.686 --> 00:44:39.647]  Looks like by the hundreds.
[00:44:39.987 --> 00:44:43.550]  He's created a slideshow that we're showing people right now on screen.
[00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:44.430]  Just a great guy.
[00:44:46.112 --> 00:44:52.897]  And yeah, it's now all over the Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, Russian, Dutch news.
[00:44:54.167 --> 00:44:54.868]  Greek news.
[00:44:55.489 --> 00:44:56.910]  Big papers in the UK.
[00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:58.532]  I've seen four big papers report on it.
[00:44:59.713 --> 00:45:02.316]  Nothing in the US but the Wall Street Journal and the AP.
[00:45:02.617 --> 00:45:04.139]  And the Wall Street Journal makes a big joke.
[00:45:04.419 --> 00:45:05.921]  Oh, big deal.
[00:45:06.541 --> 00:45:08.363]  So-called secret meeting, not so secret.
[00:45:08.383 --> 00:45:10.366]  Some leaders are meeting, no big deal.
[00:45:12.005 --> 00:45:12.645]  Well, it's no big deal.
[00:45:12.665 --> 00:45:13.225]  Why did U.S.
[00:45:13.246 --> 00:45:15.026]  media say none of this existed for decades?
[00:45:15.366 --> 00:45:17.227]  Why did they say you were a crazy kook if you talked about it?
[00:45:17.527 --> 00:45:19.128]  Why are you arrested if you try to cover it?
[00:45:19.728 --> 00:45:27.071]  Why has Bilderberg Group's own minutes been released over the years where they are literally setting world policy with world leaders and telling them what to do?
[00:45:27.651 --> 00:45:28.632]  This is big news.
[00:45:29.152 --> 00:45:30.032]  This is important.
[00:45:30.292 --> 00:45:31.793]  And we are sick and tired of it.
[00:45:32.033 --> 00:45:38.596]  And we're tired of being harassed and death-threatened and everything else that we go through to bring people this information.
[00:45:39.844 --> 00:45:46.368]  So notice they act like it doesn't exist, and then when we do expose it, they go, okay, big deal, don't look at that, nobody cares, let's just move along.
[00:45:46.708 --> 00:46:07.019]  Oh, big deal, you showed some, in fact, that's what the, he's on the Trilateral Commission, that CNN reporter, the head of CNN International, you know, is running around, he got questioned by We Are Change about it, he said, oh, big deal, just some old men meeting, it's nothing, nobody cares, and the Trilateral Commission runs nothing either.
[00:46:07.459 --> 00:46:09.160]  Meanwhile, he's one of their board members.
[00:46:11.929 --> 00:46:15.715]  So they deny it exists, and then when you finally point it out, they go, oh, it's nothing.
[00:46:15.735 --> 00:46:17.918]  And you go, well, here's your own documents that you're engaged in crime.
[00:46:18.519 --> 00:46:20.722]  Oh, well, police arrest him.
[00:46:21.283 --> 00:46:26.891]  You know, folks, these are the people that stole 14.8 trillion, more than 10 trillion from Europe and England.
[00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:27.972]  So total, that's
[00:46:28.773 --> 00:46:40.259]  24 plus trill in seven months and they're just getting started announcing and they're grabbing our car companies and handing over to foreign interest and saying GM will now be foreign cars brought into the U.S.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.761]  and Chrysler's just going to go completely away.
[00:46:44.382 --> 00:46:54.207]  And then tax money, the bailouts that were given to them, 50-something billion, that'll be used to relocate to Italy at Fiat and relocate GM to Brazil and China?
[00:46:57.642 --> 00:46:59.163]  Hey, cops serving all of this.
[00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:00.344]  What are you going to do when you lose your job?
[00:47:00.364 --> 00:47:00.824]  Well, you're not.
[00:47:01.044 --> 00:47:05.648]  You're going to live like third world cops and then be even more corrupt, taking kickbacks to live.
[00:47:05.948 --> 00:47:07.569]  We're going to be a third world cesspit.
[00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:08.830]  Good job, government.
[00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:09.610]  You sold out.

[00:48:49.122 --> 00:48:53.045]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:49:17.419 --> 00:49:22.762]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:49:23.302 --> 00:49:29.485]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:49:29.725 --> 00:49:31.606]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:49:31.766 --> 00:49:34.167]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:49:34.228 --> 00:49:45.113]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:49:47.418 --> 00:49:48.639]  It's not about left or right.
[00:49:49.079 --> 00:49:50.460]  It's about a one world government.
[00:49:50.941 --> 00:49:57.286]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:52:00.601 --> 00:52:01.282]  The 3 p.m.
[00:52:01.342 --> 00:52:02.502]  Central Standard Time.
[00:52:03.383 --> 00:52:04.724]  We are live here.
[00:52:04.804 --> 00:52:07.486]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:52:09.787 --> 00:52:19.553]  Got a big guest, one of the big Mac daddies of operating systems and cyber security, the history and future of the Internet, is joining us.
[00:52:19.593 --> 00:52:21.134]  You want to stay with us for that.
[00:52:21.735 --> 00:52:25.937]  I will take some of your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:52:26.578 --> 00:52:29.680]  Coming up as soon as I'm done playing these videos and going over this information.
[00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:37.745]  I think before I cover all the latest news and how it ties into this, it's better to just show you the video.
[00:52:39.186 --> 00:52:46.170]  Here is one of many videos out there of the Obama Brigade.
[00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:52.374]  You know, we showed people during Obama's campaign, people in camo chanting for Obama.
[00:52:53.135 --> 00:52:58.458]  And then we showed Obama saying he wants a military domestic security force, and the fact that Republicans wanted it as well.
[00:52:58.498 --> 00:52:59.579]  It's bipartisan.
[00:53:00.492 --> 00:53:02.993]  But that he could get the popular support to actually energize it.
[00:53:03.913 --> 00:53:09.895]  And now they're announcing and they're training already Boy Scouts to quote take on veterans and gun owners.
[00:53:10.375 --> 00:53:11.475]  That's in the New York Times.
[00:53:12.695 --> 00:53:16.577]  And the Homeland Security documents say the number one threat to Homeland Security is veterans and gun owners.
[00:53:16.597 --> 00:53:17.837]  So the whole system's set up for them.
[00:53:19.266 --> 00:53:32.150]  And in the article written by Kurt Nemo, he links directly to City Year and other subdivisions of AmeriCorps and SecurCorps, where they state they're under Homeland Security to carry out Homeland Security duties, including intelligence gathering.
[00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:36.952]  So, what you're about to see are spies doing paramilitary training.
[00:53:38.792 --> 00:53:41.793]  And they then mix in Martin Luther King and Gandhi with it.
[00:53:42.354 --> 00:53:46.415]  Martin Luther King and Gandhi were fighting secret police and spies and fascism.
[00:53:47.773 --> 00:53:52.095]  But it puts a nice liberal, you know, drum circle angle on it.
[00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:54.196]  But the uniforms are decidedly fascist.
[00:53:54.396 --> 00:53:57.397]  Red with black trim, with brown khakis.
[00:53:58.337 --> 00:54:05.980]  This is, I mean, if I was making a science fiction movie about a dystopic nightmare future with thug, you know, citizen corps enforcers, this would be it.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:06.861]  It's called The Corps.
[00:54:08.101 --> 00:54:13.947]  So this is part of AmeriCorps, and it says on their site, Join the Corps, and their main system.
[00:54:14.027 --> 00:54:26.518]  Now at first they have PR functions of helping old ladies and school kids, but the main function is what Rahm Emanuel said, military training three months every summer for the youth, junior high, high school, and out of school, paramilitary training with weapons.
[00:54:27.039 --> 00:54:29.821]  But don't believe me, just watch that screen.
[00:54:30.101 --> 00:54:30.502]  Here it is.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:51.743]  They brought down the Berlin Wall.
[00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:16.033]  No, behind the Berlin Wall was citizen corps in tattletale uniforms spying on the citizens.
[00:55:16.654 --> 00:55:26.398]  So they wrap tyranny and spies and federally controlled local communities and federalization of police and the Boy Scouts training for gun confiscation.
[00:55:26.739 --> 00:55:28.820]  I mean, Insecure Corps, that division,
[00:55:29.733 --> 00:55:39.757]  I've got the Philadelphia News, seven years ago under Bush, training the high schoolers and middle schoolers for warrant service and fugitive apprehension, quote, with M-16s.
[00:55:41.998 --> 00:55:46.479]  So, no, no, no, no, you'd be the people shooting the folks trying to get out of East Germany.
[00:55:46.799 --> 00:55:47.600]  Go back to the video.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:54.342]  To make this world a better place, by helping those who need it most.
[00:55:54.382 --> 00:55:56.363]  To never turn my back when... Stop right there!
[00:55:57.722 --> 00:56:06.827]  Our government and the Democratic Party has introduced bills that restrict free speech, that continue the free speech zones, that continue the Cyber Bullying Act, H.R.
[00:56:06.847 --> 00:56:13.570]  1966, that openly says if you hurt someone's feelings and they sign an affidavit, they will federally charge you under a felony.
[00:56:14.191 --> 00:56:18.653]  I mean, forget hate crimes laws where they punish some things more if they claim it was a protected group.
[00:56:18.973 --> 00:56:24.096]  This is saying that if you do something on the internet that somebody says hurt their feelings, federally charged.
[00:56:24.636 --> 00:56:27.677]  But then you show Tiananmen Square where people didn't have free speech.
[00:56:28.698 --> 00:56:30.639]  That was about free speech at Tiananmen Square.
[00:56:30.939 --> 00:56:33.480]  You show that when that's what you are!
[00:56:34.041 --> 00:56:42.184]  You camouflage yourselves in the color of liberty, in the flag of liberty, but then at the end you say, this is my uniform, this is what I wear.
[00:56:42.825 --> 00:56:43.865]  You guys are sick.
[00:56:43.885 --> 00:56:45.106]  So this is meant to suck in
[00:56:47.318 --> 00:56:48.758]  People who are just ignorant.
[00:56:48.778 --> 00:56:49.699]  I mean, my God.
[00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:52.039]  This is tyranny wrapping itself in liberty.
[00:56:52.619 --> 00:56:53.560]  And we will defeat you.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.900]  We'll be right back with more of this disgusting video.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.440]  Stay with us.
[00:57:01.261 --> 00:57:02.142]  We're on the march.
[00:57:02.642 --> 00:57:04.242]  The empire's on the run.
[00:57:05.182 --> 00:57:07.843]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:58:11.411 --> 00:58:16.735]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:17.215 --> 00:58:24.200]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:30.975]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:31.395 --> 00:58:33.216]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:33.356 --> 00:58:35.778]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:35.858 --> 00:58:46.806]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:47.447 --> 00:58:48.728]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:49.108 --> 00:58:50.469]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:50.965 --> 00:58:57.307]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:59:06.131 --> 00:59:07.271]  The Obama Deception.
[00:59:07.691 --> 00:59:08.892]  The people strike back.
[00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:13.211]  Spring is here.
[00:59:13.451 --> 00:59:14.231]  Growing season.
[00:59:14.411 --> 00:59:16.393]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:59:16.613 --> 00:59:18.014]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:59:18.314 --> 00:59:18.994]  Think about it.
[00:59:19.295 --> 00:59:23.157]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:59:23.397 --> 00:59:26.859]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.641]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:59:29.901 --> 00:59:41.769]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[00:59:42.089 --> 00:59:42.529]  Let's do it!
[01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:26.116]  Alright, let's go ahead and finish up with this.
[01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.770]  Cancer.
[01:00:38.771 --> 01:00:40.372]  America has cancer.
[01:00:40.432 --> 01:00:41.372]  It's metastasized.
[01:00:41.432 --> 01:00:42.232]  It's spread everywhere.
[01:00:42.773 --> 01:00:45.094]  The media's telling you the cancer is actually healthy.
[01:00:45.394 --> 01:00:52.998]  The public's pointing out all these tumors and things popping out, and the country's having trouble breathing, and they're saying, oh no, that's healthy.
[01:00:53.038 --> 01:00:54.438]  The rest of the body's what's bad.
[01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.199]  These tumors are the future.
[01:00:56.739 --> 01:00:59.421]  It's good to have folks running around in tattletale squads.
[01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.562]  And when you read about this Secure Corps,
[01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:05.904]  And one of its subgroups is set up by Clinton, now expanding, City Year.
[01:01:06.304 --> 01:01:07.945]  And David Gergen involved in the rest of them.
[01:01:07.985 --> 01:01:08.705]  It's bipartisan.
[01:01:09.726 --> 01:01:12.087]  You find out that it is Homeland Security roles.
[01:01:13.107 --> 01:01:18.310]  So I'm going to cover all that and dovetail it into the new world and what life under it will be like in a moment.
[01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.790]  But let's finish up with that video.
[01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:20.151]  Here it is.
[01:01:35.182 --> 01:01:38.884]  And this... is what I wear.
[01:01:44.195 --> 01:01:48.438]  Now that is designed for the most mindless fluoride head kid.
[01:01:48.758 --> 01:01:49.779]  Totally dumbed down.
[01:01:50.259 --> 01:01:50.920]  I am changed.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.540]  Very simple.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.261]  Very stupid.
[01:01:52.521 --> 01:01:54.963]  And this is what I wear because kids are all about what they wear.
[01:01:55.023 --> 01:01:56.644]  And look, I know how to zip a zipper.
[01:01:56.924 --> 01:02:05.570]  You know, I'm 14 and normally a four-year-old could do this, but the fluorides got me to the point where and the mercury shots and the GMO food where I can zip a zipper.
[01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:06.571]  Zip!
[01:02:06.611 --> 01:02:11.614]  And you know, it's real popular with the drum circle and kind of what's, you know, cool.
[01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:13.135]  I don't know.
[01:02:34.395 --> 01:02:39.597]  But for also completely private groups, the Democratic Party, like usaservice.org.
[01:02:39.657 --> 01:02:41.638]  And then you're under their control, but it has the U.S.
[01:02:41.658 --> 01:02:42.619]  government seal on it.
[01:02:43.299 --> 01:02:49.762]  And it's literally, they're out doing gun buyback programs to condition everybody to turn their guns in, and to see the news images of that.
[01:02:50.682 --> 01:02:53.844]  They're busy, I mean, pushing so many facets of this.
[01:02:54.224 --> 01:02:58.306]  And then I covered last week the story out of the New York Times.
[01:03:00.017 --> 01:03:02.560]  Perhaps we can pull this article up for folks if we have time.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:05.583]  Government readies youth corps to take on vets.
[01:03:05.643 --> 01:03:08.827]  Now, that's what the first paragraph of the New York Times said.
[01:03:09.307 --> 01:03:15.474]  That they're training them with these dummy MP5 BB guns and the rest of it with Homeland Security all over the nation.
[01:03:15.755 --> 01:03:16.816]  But that's only one program.
[01:03:16.856 --> 01:03:21.221]  Then they have other programs in 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th grade right on up.
[01:03:21.681 --> 01:03:25.784]  Where the public schools and Secure Corps do warrant service, fugitive apprehension.
[01:03:26.184 --> 01:03:30.727]  So see, it's not good for kids to have guns and paintball and play or do laser tag or whatever.
[01:03:31.048 --> 01:03:32.489]  The media says that's evil and bad.
[01:03:32.609 --> 01:03:34.930]  But if you do it under the government, it's okay.
[01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.572]  That's a sanctioned, kosher place to do this.
[01:03:38.113 --> 01:03:42.196]  So the kids run out and want to be part of this and it's under state control.
[01:03:42.256 --> 01:03:44.958]  And Hitler took the Boy Scouts that Germany had.
[01:03:45.698 --> 01:03:49.680]  And militarized it and turned it into the Hitlerjugend and said, you're going to spy, you're going to tattle.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.942]  And we have public schools all over the nation, you know, writing dossiers on your parents, what's in the medicine cabinet.
[01:03:55.722 --> 01:04:09.848]  They have law enforcement semesters starting in the 6th grade, and then they have them again in the 8th and 9th grade where the kids have a federal deputized, deputized local county sheriff or police officer in the class teaching them.
[01:04:10.928 --> 01:04:14.910]  And now the economy is converting over where most of the new scholarships
[01:04:16.064 --> 01:04:22.805]  And grants aren't for electrical engineering or arts or botany or biology.
[01:04:22.885 --> 01:04:24.966]  It is now all about law enforcement.
[01:04:25.046 --> 01:04:26.966]  ITT technical isn't ITT technical.
[01:04:27.366 --> 01:04:30.107]  It's now ITT law enforcement or security guards.
[01:04:30.527 --> 01:04:31.827]  This is the new economy.
[01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:32.908]  They're converting it over.
[01:04:32.928 --> 01:04:44.070]  Because the big banks own all these private companies that supply the police and the military and Lockheed Martin puts in the face scanning cameras and the license plate reading cameras and Lockheed Martin and others put in the license plate readers and the
[01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:45.851]  Red light cameras.
[01:04:46.391 --> 01:04:48.252]  All of this they're making huge profits off of.
[01:04:48.272 --> 01:04:49.793]  They're converting our economy.
[01:04:50.113 --> 01:04:51.573]  Brain scanners at the airports.
[01:04:51.914 --> 01:04:54.095]  Biometric scanners that scan your naked body.
[01:04:54.635 --> 01:04:59.137]  Big defense contractors, if you read all over the country, putting cameras in school bathrooms.
[01:04:59.477 --> 01:05:01.759]  Cameras in the school lunchrooms.
[01:05:01.819 --> 01:05:03.099]  Cameras in the classrooms.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:13.905]  Free federal computers where the kids do their English class stuff on a federal computer and a laptop they take home, but they admit that that's downloaded by the feds to quote check for plagiarism.
[01:05:14.985 --> 01:05:25.812]  Because they run it against the database, but oh, also a database of what your kids are, and during the law enforcement class, it's on a computer, that goes to the feds, so now it's actual dossiers being written about your family.
[01:05:26.072 --> 01:05:34.437]  They admit this in the actual grants to the schools, but to the parents, they're told, oh, your child's being taught how to be a police officer, and you know, isn't this great, they're going to be like Jack Bauer.
[01:05:34.718 --> 01:05:36.319]  And then notice almost all the toys.
[01:05:37.284 --> 01:05:41.085]  Whole aisles at Target or Toys R Us are about kid spies.
[01:05:41.125 --> 01:05:42.185]  Get this, be a spy.
[01:05:42.225 --> 01:05:43.225]  Get that, be a spy.
[01:05:43.585 --> 01:05:47.286]  You watch the kid shows on TV, it's all about being spies and spy kids.
[01:05:47.946 --> 01:05:52.787]  Massive total conditioning everywhere, ladies and gentlemen, as they convert us to this.
[01:05:52.827 --> 01:05:57.108]  And then the New York Times reports, oh, isn't it great the little girls tell their mom not to take a bath.
[01:05:57.388 --> 01:05:58.928]  They tell their mom not to eat as much food.
[01:05:58.968 --> 01:05:59.709]  She's overweight.
[01:05:59.949 --> 01:06:01.409]  Her carbon footprint's too big.
[01:06:01.629 --> 01:06:05.470]  And then parents email me and call me and go, yeah, my kid came home and said, turn the sink off.
[01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:06.370]  You're using too much water.
[01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:07.811]  Our light bulbs are wrong.
[01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:17.039]  Sounds reasonable reason to have them be little spies of the states to these environmental parents, but then it can quickly be converted over into, what does mommy drink?
[01:06:17.079 --> 01:06:17.940]  What does mommy smoke?
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.061]  What does mommy say?
[01:06:19.101 --> 01:06:19.781]  What does mommy do?
[01:06:19.841 --> 01:06:21.503]  And now, that's happening!
[01:06:22.063 --> 01:06:29.870]  So, when you see this, these guys are being trained to take on vets, trained to take on gun owners, trained to take on the American people, and in Kurt Nimmo's article,
[01:06:31.235 --> 01:06:31.955]  Excellent article.
[01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:35.496]  AmeriCorps' paramilitary propaganda ad.
[01:06:36.136 --> 01:06:46.999]  In this story, he details, with links to the Homeland Defense Pentagon link, where they admit this is their main function as homeland surveillance and intelligence.
[01:06:47.019 --> 01:06:49.500]  Well, what did Obama say in that speech?
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:50.340]  In fact, pull that up.
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.721]  It's in the Obama Deception.
[01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:54.761]  That's why the film's so important.
[01:06:57.122 --> 01:06:58.582]  I just want to go over all this right now.
[01:06:59.463 --> 01:07:07.645]  If you go to it, you know, he says we needed a civilian intelligence agency just as big and strong as the military.
[01:07:07.745 --> 01:07:08.846]  Well, that's a million strong.
[01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:10.966]  Then I got corrected a few weeks ago in the L.A.
[01:07:10.986 --> 01:07:11.386]  Times.
[01:07:11.426 --> 01:07:14.047]  The Congresswoman said, no, we want seven million.
[01:07:14.907 --> 01:07:15.388]  Seven.
[01:07:15.568 --> 01:07:16.728]  See, people think I exaggerate.
[01:07:16.768 --> 01:07:18.088]  I said one million because he said that.
[01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:19.389]  Seven million.
[01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:39.817]  And Kurt details in this article, AmeriCorps' paramilitary propaganda ad, also the Daily Newscaster detailed it, how this is to work with police departments, public safety grants, the war against terrorism on the home front, and they give them the training manuals that say, conservatives, gun owners, people that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:40.498]  Constitution.
[01:07:41.434 --> 01:07:43.795]  They need eyes and ears to do it.
[01:07:43.995 --> 01:07:51.159]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play Obama what he's saying they will be used for as they do military drills on TV.
[01:07:51.219 --> 01:07:51.659]  Here it is.
[01:07:51.979 --> 01:07:59.103]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[01:07:59.903 --> 01:08:06.947]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:08:08.385 --> 01:08:09.025]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:08:09.846 --> 01:08:12.547]  Now, let me go ahead and get into the other things that are happening.
[01:08:12.567 --> 01:08:13.527]  The text of H.R.
[01:08:13.547 --> 01:08:26.572]  1966, the Cyberbullying Act, racing through the House, openly states, word for word, that if you hurt someone's feelings, they sign an affidavit, federal felony, five years in prison, massive fines.
[01:08:26.612 --> 01:08:27.613]  You can go read it for yourself.
[01:08:28.173 --> 01:08:29.934]  Okay, then they have other bills introduced.
[01:08:30.174 --> 01:08:33.915]  This just came out this Sunday, BrokenInfoWars.com.
[01:08:34.315 --> 01:08:36.696]  We have a link to the No Fly, No Buy Act, H.R. 2401.
[01:08:39.909 --> 01:08:51.677]  Where they state openly to everyone that no judge, no jury, no arrest, no why you're on the list, just you're not allowed to buy guns and SWAT teams are coming to take them.
[01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:55.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, my dad's been on a no-fly list.
[01:08:57.161 --> 01:08:58.322]  And they say, no way to get off.
[01:08:58.362 --> 01:09:01.805]  You can write a letter here to some secret agency, we feel like you might get off of it.
[01:09:02.165 --> 01:09:03.726]  Because, you know, his name's very common.
[01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:08.249]  Airport secures bars,
[01:09:09.472 --> 01:09:10.273]  All or does it?
[01:09:11.574 --> 01:09:13.536]  And he just brought an article about the body scanners.
[01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:19.122]  I've got other crazy articles about patents for exploding cyanide chips I didn't get to last week.
[01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:24.127]  Where they want to put exploding cyanide chips in you and if you're not good, they hit a radio frequency and it kills you.
[01:09:24.507 --> 01:09:25.988]  This is what governments are pushing.
[01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:27.410]  By the way, that's AP.
[01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:30.232]  And they're just like, oh, what's wrong with your cyanide chip?
[01:09:30.252 --> 01:09:31.153]  You're not with Al-Qaeda.
[01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:32.595]  I mean, my God!
[01:09:32.615 --> 01:09:40.408]  There was that famous case in 2012 when the Al-Qaeda tried to hit this or that because they had exploding cyanide chips that saved the children.
[01:09:40.888 --> 01:09:43.152]  You're not for killing children, are you?
[01:09:45.095 --> 01:09:47.018]  Remember Homeland Security saying they want us to all wear...
[01:09:47.719 --> 01:09:49.401]  Taser bracelets when we get on planes?
[01:09:49.621 --> 01:09:51.082]  In fact, pull that up for folks!
[01:09:51.403 --> 01:09:57.308]  And then Homeland Security came on and said, yes, we're looking at making you wear taser bracelets right out of the running, man!
[01:09:57.969 --> 01:10:00.031]  Next, it's an exploding necklace around your neck.
[01:10:00.451 --> 01:10:05.356]  I mean, folks, it's so over the top, the public doesn't... They've introduced bills.
[01:10:06.216 --> 01:10:06.677]  Look at this one.
[01:10:06.917 --> 01:10:09.059]  Billing Congress would ban gun ownership at will.
[01:10:09.099 --> 01:10:10.020]  I'm going to cover that next.
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.441]  But first, Aaron Dykes.
[01:10:12.355 --> 01:10:14.603]  Did more research this week, and you ought to do a blurb about this.
[01:10:14.924 --> 01:10:17.092]  He tends to do the research and so busy he never gets the articles.
[01:10:18.208 --> 01:10:25.753]  David Gergen is bipartisan, big Republicans, Trilateral Commission is involved with this city year division of Secure Corp.
[01:10:26.414 --> 01:10:30.076]  They hand out private grants so the fat cats make the money, but it's under federal control.
[01:10:30.376 --> 01:10:32.898]  This is the new fascistic model they call socialism.
[01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:37.541]  They mix in their recruitment videos with Mahatma Gandhi, who would fight against that.
[01:10:37.941 --> 01:10:41.243]  Not squads of tattletales in government uniforms.
[01:10:42.484 --> 01:10:46.347]  And so you're here to give us the inside scoop on this one division
[01:10:48.119 --> 01:10:50.761]  You know, they've got at least ten divisions of these people.
[01:10:50.861 --> 01:10:56.645]  They're going to have the elderly, you know, the Senior Corps, the EnviroCorps, the Green Corps, the Security Corps.
[01:10:57.345 --> 01:10:58.106]  That's what this is.
[01:10:58.526 --> 01:10:59.627]  It just goes on and on.
[01:10:59.647 --> 01:11:07.452]  The Infrastructure Corps, that's InfraGard with the 56,000 executives with license to kill their employees during emergencies.
[01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:08.713]  007 Power.
[01:11:08.933 --> 01:11:13.315]  I mean, Preachers, you know, the Clergy Response Team Corps.
[01:11:13.616 --> 01:11:14.696]  And it's all bipartisan.
[01:11:15.057 --> 01:11:16.498]  So, Aaron Dykes led us
[01:11:17.758 --> 01:11:20.161]  A breakdown of the research you've done just on this one division.
[01:11:20.821 --> 01:11:22.023]  Yeah, I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:11:22.063 --> 01:11:31.171]  I think you probably remember around the time Obama deception was coming out, a lot of people were like, oh, is there really going to be some civilian national force service?
[01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:35.476]  And then it was all announced by the White House and all announced by the last two White Houses.
[01:11:35.536 --> 01:11:37.738]  And then they just people still live in denial.
[01:11:38.038 --> 01:11:41.181]  Yeah, people tried to deny it, and then Rahm Emanuel has a book on it.
[01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:42.422]  He's on TV about it.
[01:11:42.502 --> 01:11:45.764]  He gave like 20 speeches, C-SPAN, everywhere.
[01:11:45.784 --> 01:11:48.647]  Yeah, it turns out Brzezinski wrote about it in his book.
[01:11:49.127 --> 01:12:02.939]  And now David Gergen, back in 2007, helped launch America Forward, which is a collective of all these organizations, including City Year and also Teachers.
[01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:06.442]  There's literally some 60-plus organizations.
[01:12:07.302 --> 01:12:08.782]  And he's just launched all of them.
[01:12:09.082 --> 01:12:14.723]  And by the way, if you nexus it in, last week, 50 plus top academics and NGOs came out and called for world government.
[01:12:15.303 --> 01:12:16.424]  It's all the same groups.
[01:12:17.024 --> 01:12:20.544]  And they all get government money to come in and take over your cities and counties.
[01:12:20.844 --> 01:12:24.585]  We had that British guy on about a month ago about the group over there doing the same thing.
[01:12:24.945 --> 01:12:26.265]  This is how they're taking over.
[01:12:26.285 --> 01:12:30.746]  And then they tell all the other churches, join us, we'll give you federal money to put out our propaganda.
[01:12:30.966 --> 01:12:34.847]  But if you don't join us, we're going to come and arrest you for tax evasion.
[01:12:35.327 --> 01:12:37.011]  I mean, this is tyranny, man!
[01:12:37.071 --> 01:12:37.753]  This is happening!
[01:12:38.325 --> 01:12:43.188]  Yeah, and who would figure the presidential advisor to what, four or five presidents in a row?
[01:12:44.909 --> 01:12:48.392]  He's on the board for City Year and all these other organizations.
[01:12:48.912 --> 01:12:51.474]  Here's the list of all the organizations he started.
[01:12:51.494 --> 01:12:54.996]  It's literally, this is the longer list, this is the shorter list.
[01:12:55.376 --> 01:12:57.618]  Colin Powell started one of these organizations.
[01:12:57.858 --> 01:12:58.959]  This is how they're going to rule.
[01:12:59.119 --> 01:13:04.803]  Every city, every county has its government funded, federally, internationally funded NGO.
[01:13:05.183 --> 01:13:07.484]  They only have standing at the UN or Congress.
[01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:09.966]  And they've got unlimited capital.
[01:13:10.206 --> 01:13:11.227]  They're moving against us.
[01:13:11.688 --> 01:13:12.088]  And you're right.
[01:13:12.108 --> 01:13:18.232]  Listen, you can go to an event and protest the North American Union or the SPP taking over the highways, which they claim we've beat, but they're still going ahead with it.
[01:13:18.573 --> 01:13:22.496]  And these people will walk up to you and start bumping you and start getting in your face and laughing.
[01:13:22.896 --> 01:13:29.521]  Imagine being scum for just 20 bucks an hour, 15 bucks an hour, who goes out and tries to destroy freedom.
[01:13:30.282 --> 01:13:31.043]  That's terrible.
[01:13:31.063 --> 01:13:31.844]  That's the other sick part.
[01:13:31.864 --> 01:13:33.265]  They call it National Compulsory Service.
[01:13:33.285 --> 01:13:39.052]  They're going to make school kids and graduates do this, but they say, oh, it's not slavery because we pay you.
[01:13:39.232 --> 01:13:41.415]  Well, they pay you when they draft you in the Army.
[01:13:41.435 --> 01:13:43.517]  Yeah, that's actually what Gergen says.
[01:13:43.557 --> 01:13:45.579]  He said that's also paid volunteerism.
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:47.502]  What's wrong with paid volunteerism?
[01:13:47.582 --> 01:13:48.743]  It's not volunteerism.
[01:13:51.425 --> 01:13:54.027]  They've had acts called the National Compulsory Service Act.
[01:13:54.748 --> 01:13:56.749]  Volunteerism isn't compulsory!
[01:13:56.949 --> 01:13:57.190]  Yeah.
[01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:59.611]  And it's true, it's under Homeland Security.
[01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:06.777]  AmeriCorps and all of them are under Homeland Security under a branch, I think it's called Center for National Service or something like that.
[01:14:06.937 --> 01:14:09.059]  And they state their main job is tattling.
[01:14:09.739 --> 01:14:13.240]  These people are absolute cancer to America, and I don't just say that.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.701]  This is literal, literal filth.
[01:14:17.042 --> 01:14:18.622]  They don't put up with this in Eastern Europe anymore.
[01:14:18.642 --> 01:14:19.522]  Those people ran them out.
[01:14:19.863 --> 01:14:21.123]  They don't put up with this in China.
[01:14:21.163 --> 01:14:21.903]  The people don't like it.
[01:14:22.223 --> 01:14:24.124]  They don't put up with this anywhere, folks.
[01:14:24.184 --> 01:14:27.785]  This is the dirtiest, filthiest crap there is, Aaron.
[01:14:28.105 --> 01:14:29.606]  Can you believe this is happening in America?
[01:14:30.282 --> 01:14:31.043]  It's hard to believe.
[01:14:31.263 --> 01:14:36.568]  You know, I didn't know about all this stuff at first, and then, you know, there's stuff like the Department of Defense, 1404.
[01:14:36.748 --> 01:14:44.435]  As soon as Obama started, they do have national security forces over in foreign countries holding weapons.
[01:14:45.115 --> 01:14:49.839]  And it says they will operate here domestically under NORTHCOM, and it says it will be a multi-hundred thousand man army.
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.302]  And then the Marines announced, look at this, this just came in Friday.
[01:14:53.643 --> 01:14:55.164]  I can't even cover all of this.
[01:14:55.204 --> 01:14:55.765]  Look at this!
[01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:56.765]  Look at this!
[01:14:57.526 --> 01:15:06.912]  This is a new, they're going to have their new domestic municipal forces that operate in and around the military bases and off the bases, and then they have regular Marines running checkpoints searching U.S.
[01:15:06.932 --> 01:15:07.333]  citizens.
[01:15:07.813 --> 01:15:09.054]  And then look at these cops!
[01:15:09.554 --> 01:15:13.216]  A national police force under the Marines to operate off base!
[01:15:13.977 --> 01:15:15.038]  Oh, hi, I'm the Marine!
[01:15:15.418 --> 01:15:16.659]  And these guys are trained folks.
[01:15:17.119 --> 01:15:21.122]  That's why we just had a We Are Changer I know real well call here.
[01:15:21.422 --> 01:15:22.503]  His sister lives in Austin.
[01:15:23.163 --> 01:15:23.964]  They pulled him over.
[01:15:23.984 --> 01:15:26.265]  They were making the guy drive into a sobriety check.
[01:15:26.305 --> 01:15:27.365]  They hadn't been drinking, by the way.
[01:15:28.266 --> 01:15:30.867]  And she starts calling her brother, Nate Evans.
[01:15:31.308 --> 01:15:32.868]  The cop walks over and says, get off your phone.
[01:15:32.888 --> 01:15:34.049]  She says, I'm allowed to be on the phone.
[01:15:34.449 --> 01:15:36.510]  Slams her face in, splits her whole head open.
[01:15:36.771 --> 01:15:40.413]  She's lucky they didn't gun her down in the back and then say she shouldn't have been out at night.
[01:15:40.993 --> 01:15:47.717]  Because, you know, I heard people on News Radio 590 call her the other day when the cops shot these two guys, saying, good, if you're out at night, you deserve to die.
[01:15:48.547 --> 01:15:52.990]  This is the level of groveling to the police now, where, yes, kill anyone out at night!
[01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.891]  Kill us!
[01:15:53.991 --> 01:15:54.491]  Kill us!
[01:15:55.412 --> 01:15:57.053]  You know, I mean, my God, man.
[01:15:57.333 --> 01:15:58.614]  Oh, you're just a cop basher.
[01:15:58.654 --> 01:15:59.675]  Yeah, you know.
[01:16:02.216 --> 01:16:02.937]  My God, folks.
[01:16:03.789 --> 01:16:07.252]  Well, I think they're going to phase this stuff all in with 50 different heads.
[01:16:07.272 --> 01:16:12.936]  There's going to be a kickstart, a head start, teachers for service, all these different organizations.
[01:16:13.056 --> 01:16:15.177]  All drawing paychecks with our tax money.
[01:16:15.197 --> 01:16:18.680]  While we all just sit here... I mean, government is... Bush tripled the size of government.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.742]  Obama, in the first two months, doubled the tripling.
[01:16:22.392 --> 01:16:23.053]  It's all over!
[01:16:23.233 --> 01:16:24.655]  They're like roaches.
[01:16:24.916 --> 01:16:28.220]  It's like if you turn your light on at night in the kitchen and there were 8 million roaches.
[01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:29.522]  Just piles of them.
[01:16:29.722 --> 01:16:32.226]  And they're looking at you saying, you're bad, get out of our house.
[01:16:32.907 --> 01:16:33.748]  And I guess it's true.
[01:16:33.788 --> 01:16:34.589]  They are the roaches.
[01:16:34.609 --> 01:16:35.390]  They run everything.
[01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:36.913]  And that's the end of it.
[01:16:37.637 --> 01:16:38.237]  That's terrible.
[01:16:38.637 --> 01:16:44.278]  Yeah, David Gergen's writing since 2006 about how to get government to fund more of these national service groups.
[01:16:44.679 --> 01:16:48.159]  He saw that Obama was coming and knew this thing was going to be rammed forward.
[01:16:48.639 --> 01:16:49.840]  I'm sure for a lot of other reasons.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:58.762]  And then meanwhile, they've introduced three bills where any designate of the federal government can put you on a list, you can't find out why you're on a list, no more Second Amendment, and then they come and take your guns.
[01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:04.403]  You get hit by a SWAT team, too bad if they kill you, the locals will get on the news and say, HE DESERVED IT!
[01:17:05.703 --> 01:17:09.846]  You know, I mean, and these guys are old in Iraq, confiscating guns and kicking in doors all day.
[01:17:10.066 --> 01:17:11.107]  They show up here.
[01:17:11.887 --> 01:17:14.529]  You wonder how people fell to the Nazis and stuff and the Communists?
[01:17:14.609 --> 01:17:16.950]  Because the people go along with orders, man.
[01:17:17.411 --> 01:17:24.115]  They rationalize that it's good, but it's going to get so bad that all of you are going to lose in the end and your family name is going to be destroyed.
[01:17:24.135 --> 01:17:28.298]  A lot of you cops and military are going to go to prison because we're going to beat you in the end.
[01:17:28.658 --> 01:17:42.604]  I just want, I probably won't be here after all this Aaron, but when we finally take America back and take the world back, I do want to make sure we hunt all these people down and give them a proper trial with their juries, but everybody that commits treason, I really think they need the death penalty.
[01:17:43.344 --> 01:17:46.966]  I'm sorry, I really think that they need to at least be given life in prison.
[01:17:47.466 --> 01:17:52.228]  All these prisons full of pot smokers will fill it full of government bureaucrats and cops that broke the law.
[01:17:53.533 --> 01:17:55.114]  Now, you think you're invincible now.
[01:17:55.134 --> 01:17:55.934]  You think you've won.
[01:17:55.974 --> 01:17:58.156]  You think you've destroyed the country and you've had the victory.
[01:17:58.436 --> 01:17:59.136]  No, you haven't!
[01:18:00.177 --> 01:18:00.597]  Right here.
[01:18:00.897 --> 01:18:03.979]  Bill in Congress would ban gun ownership at will.
[01:18:04.419 --> 01:18:05.780]  Now, I know a lot of cops are good.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:07.101]  Do you stand with this?
[01:18:07.561 --> 01:18:09.262]  They got bills to ban free speech!
[01:18:09.382 --> 01:18:10.103]  It's happening!
[01:18:10.203 --> 01:18:11.504]  There's no more time to suck your phone!
[01:18:11.524 --> 01:18:12.744]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:18:12.925 --> 01:18:14.365]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:18:14.666 --> 01:18:16.907]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:18:17.347 --> 01:18:22.070]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:18:22.483 --> 01:18:25.324]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:18:25.664 --> 01:18:41.570]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.

[01:18:45.852 --> 01:18:48.293]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:18:48.533 --> 01:18:49.113]  We're good.
[01:19:11.192 --> 01:19:12.533]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.

[01:19:58.047 --> 01:20:00.928]  Have you ever noticed that celebrities are endorsing weight loss products and health aids?
[01:20:21.493 --> 01:20:24.178]  Do you think they endorse these products for free?
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:25.981]  I don't think so.
[01:20:26.281 --> 01:20:30.128]  I'm here to tell you, I'm not a celebrity, and Life Change Tea doesn't need one.
[01:20:30.369 --> 01:20:33.615]  Think about this, the product speaks for itself!
[01:20:34.213 --> 01:20:35.275]  What a concept!

[01:20:37.357 --> 01:20:39.420]  You get healthy and you'll lose weight.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:40.561]  Summer's coming.
[01:20:40.781 --> 01:20:41.763]  Look and feel good.
[01:20:42.323 --> 01:20:42.764]  Order now.
[01:20:42.784 --> 01:20:42.824]  928-308-0408.
[01:20:43.224 --> 01:20:43.905]  Write this down.
[01:20:43.925 --> 01:20:43.965]  928-308-0408.
[01:20:51.795 --> 01:20:55.776]  Alright, I'm gonna get into the attack on the Second Amendment.
[01:21:21.912 --> 01:21:25.553]  Which is an absolute declaration of war.
[01:21:26.073 --> 01:21:28.414]  I mean, this is not just the end of the second, it's the end of everything.
[01:21:29.054 --> 01:21:38.137]  They say, we secretly are going to take your guns, we're secretly going to put you on the list, we're going to secretly not allow you to buy guns, and you can't ever find out why, and there's no judge, no jury, no indictment.
[01:21:38.537 --> 01:21:41.699]  And if you think the cops aren't going to follow orders and carry this out, you've got another thing coming.
[01:21:42.219 --> 01:21:47.500]  Bush didn't dribble the size of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives because he wanted to play games.
[01:21:47.981 --> 01:21:49.041]  And Obama is coming.
[01:21:50.492 --> 01:21:51.573]  I can't believe it's come to this.
[01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:58.616]  They'll just pick us off one at a time and there's these right head cops that just love SWAT team and families.
[01:21:58.737 --> 01:22:00.017]  I just can't believe it.
[01:22:00.237 --> 01:22:03.039]  And you know, don't say the government isn't rogue and isn't criminal.
[01:22:03.819 --> 01:22:04.880]  I've heard enough from you.
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:08.842]  If I don't see police out mass protesting against the government, you're bad.
[01:22:09.482 --> 01:22:10.563]  And I don't see you out doing it.
[01:22:11.784 --> 01:22:13.004]  And look, you can be mad at me now.
[01:22:13.364 --> 01:22:14.125]  Be mad at me now.
[01:22:14.445 --> 01:22:15.626]  Wish you'd have fought back later.
[01:22:16.613 --> 01:22:17.774]  Everything's being destroyed.
[01:22:17.914 --> 01:22:19.054]  All our liberties, all our freedoms.
[01:22:19.094 --> 01:22:20.355]  I want to finish up with that in a moment.
[01:22:21.735 --> 01:22:24.237]  Huge news, most maximum level alert we've got.
[01:22:24.757 --> 01:22:25.817]  Can you get it out to everybody?
[01:22:27.178 --> 01:22:29.219]  I want to tell you about eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:22:29.239 --> 01:22:32.521]  They're the best storable foods company out there, bar none.
[01:22:32.541 --> 01:22:34.742]  That's where I've gotten my storable foods.
[01:22:35.102 --> 01:22:37.043]  Lasts more than 10 years in climate controlled.
[01:22:37.063 --> 01:22:41.385]  10 years in your garage or attic or in a shed if it's non-climate controlled.
[01:22:42.045 --> 01:22:43.726]  These are in these triple enameled cans.
[01:22:44.306 --> 01:22:46.427]  High-quality dehydrated or freeze-dried food.
[01:22:46.687 --> 01:22:48.087]  Just incredibly low prices.
[01:22:48.107 --> 01:22:48.968]  Non-GMO.
[01:22:48.988 --> 01:22:51.649]  Just great stuff.
[01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.909]  800-409-5633.
[01:22:52.449 --> 01:22:55.970]  In these uncertain times, with all this craziness going on, being self-sufficient is the key.
[01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.050]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.130]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:22:56.150 --> 01:22:56.791]  Or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:23:04.321 --> 01:23:10.111]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, 1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:23:10.471 --> 01:23:17.703]  The swine flu virus breakout may get much more serious because it's a manufactured virus.
[01:23:18.858 --> 01:23:19.919]  I told you it was that day one.
[01:23:19.939 --> 01:23:22.701]  The media now admits it, and they're saying it's going to come back out in the fall.
[01:23:22.981 --> 01:23:25.422]  With the economy, with all of this, it's good to get prepared.
[01:23:25.442 --> 01:23:28.604]  800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:23:28.964 --> 01:23:30.966]  Also, mysolarbackup.com.
[01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:34.348]  A lot of stuff can happen during these crazy times.
[01:23:34.588 --> 01:23:37.550]  Power outages, hurricanes, tornadoes, you name it.
[01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:38.430]  Government control.
[01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:42.353]  This is like having your own little power plant hidden in your house.
[01:23:42.373 --> 01:23:45.455]  1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[01:23:46.637 --> 01:23:51.641]  The PowerSource 800 power plant and high-efficiency panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:23:52.682 --> 01:23:56.444]  Solar generators like having a silent power plant, as I said, hidden in your home.
[01:23:56.805 --> 01:24:00.167]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[01:24:00.507 --> 01:24:01.328]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:24:01.348 --> 01:24:01.968]  MySolarBackup.com or 1-877-327-0365.
[01:24:01.988 --> 01:24:02.148]  877-327-0365.
[01:24:02.168 --> 01:24:02.749]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:24:02.769 --> 01:24:03.529]  Now listen to me.
[01:24:13.103 --> 01:24:17.830]  They have three different bills introduced that we've covered here on air.
[01:24:18.632 --> 01:24:20.053]  Three different bills, H.R.
[01:24:20.073 --> 01:24:24.776]  2159, denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists.
[01:24:25.076 --> 01:24:33.361]  Says you're not convicted, you're on a MIAC or DHS report, or any other reason, or one of our AmeriCorps people lists you as maybe an extremist.
[01:24:33.841 --> 01:24:43.827]  As Washington staff says, if we maybe think you might be a terrorist, if we maybe think you might be, no rights, you're not part of the American family, no Second Amendment for you.
[01:24:43.847 --> 01:24:44.527]  That's a quote.
[01:24:44.547 --> 01:24:46.849]  In fact, put my article, Kurt's article, up on screen.
[01:24:49.005 --> 01:24:51.786]  There's the video you can watch of Rahm Emanuel saying that word for word.
[01:24:51.806 --> 01:24:53.647]  I've seen it so many times I now have it memorized.
[01:24:53.727 --> 01:24:54.847]  It's in the Obama Deception.
[01:24:55.227 --> 01:24:57.568]  Bill in Congress would ban gun ownership at will.
[01:25:00.909 --> 01:25:06.791]  And it says on May 13th, Democrat Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced the No Fly No Buy Act, H.R.
[01:25:06.811 --> 01:25:06.791]  2401.
[01:25:06.831 --> 01:25:10.352]  This is a new bill.
[01:25:10.972 --> 01:25:13.933]  They got another bill where the Attorney General could ban any guns he wants at will.
[01:25:15.494 --> 01:25:16.114]  This is tyranny.
[01:25:17.352 --> 01:25:21.453]  You know, that Kim Jong-il in North Korea, he can do whatever he wants, he's a dictator.
[01:25:21.473 --> 01:25:22.634]  Well, it's the same thing with this.
[01:25:23.454 --> 01:25:28.935]  On May 13, Democrat Carolyn McCarthy introduced the No Fly, No Buy Act, H.R.
[01:25:28.955 --> 01:25:37.338]  2401, a bill that will merge the TSA's no-fly list with the National Instant Background Criminal Check System, which I always told you was a way of listing you as a terrorist.
[01:25:38.438 --> 01:25:40.499]  I told you years ago they were going to merge this with the no-fly.
[01:25:42.335 --> 01:25:43.876]  I'm going to come back in 70 seconds.
[01:25:43.916 --> 01:25:45.298]  I hope stations carry this five minutes.
[01:25:45.658 --> 01:25:48.260]  And then we'll break all this down in detail when we've got a big guest coming up.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.181]  Stay with us.
[01:25:52.664 --> 01:25:54.746]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:25:55.286 --> 01:25:58.469]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:26:00.831 --> 01:26:02.393]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:26:02.513 --> 01:26:07.099]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:10.023]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:26:10.224 --> 01:26:13.087]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:26:13.288 --> 01:26:17.994]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:26:18.214 --> 01:26:19.155]  If you simply prepare.
[01:26:19.335 --> 01:26:22.317]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:26:22.578 --> 01:26:29.483]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:26:29.583 --> 01:26:32.706]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:26:32.866 --> 01:26:33.066]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:26:33.106 --> 01:26:34.527]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:44.053]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:26:44.253 --> 01:26:47.995]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:26:48.015 --> 01:26:49.516]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:26:49.556 --> 01:26:49.976]  Take action today.
[01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:51.817]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:27:03.627 --> 01:27:05.528]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:27:06.008 --> 01:27:08.988]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:22.172]  We're scheduled to have the inventor of GNU Linux coming up in the next segment.
[01:27:23.266 --> 01:27:24.447]  I know I said we'd have open phones.
[01:27:24.487 --> 01:27:25.568]  We will later, too.
[01:27:25.768 --> 01:27:26.788]  So much is going on.
[01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:29.570]  Right now, let me finish up with the attack on the Second Amendment.
[01:27:29.890 --> 01:27:34.353]  There's one bill introduced where the Attorney General can ban any firearms at will.
[01:27:35.354 --> 01:27:39.877]  It's just like Congress voted to give all its authority over trade to foreign private companies.
[01:27:40.737 --> 01:27:42.098]  World Trade Organization.
[01:27:42.158 --> 01:27:47.420]  Or a UNESCO treaty that gives control of our schools and our policies.
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:51.061]  The globalists want an international criminal court with the U.S.
[01:27:51.081 --> 01:27:51.641]  signed on.
[01:27:51.661 --> 01:27:55.383]  Obama says he supports a treaty to waive our rights to the Second Amendment.
[01:27:56.658 --> 01:28:00.960]  And they have the nerve to get on the news and say, we don't get these crazy people buying guns at record levels.
[01:28:01.461 --> 01:28:14.928]  We don't want their guns, while the Attorney General, the White House Chief of Staff, the President, all have called publicly or introduced legislation to ban even single-shot .22s, to take every firearm from the American people, including black powder.
[01:28:15.228 --> 01:28:21.951]  Total gun ban on record, bills introduced to do it, and they just keep saying, what are you talking about?
[01:28:22.572 --> 01:28:23.292]  What are you talking about?
[01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:24.553]  I mean, these people,
[01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:26.634]  You thought Bill Clinton lied.
[01:28:26.674 --> 01:28:27.874]  You thought George Bush lied.
[01:28:28.534 --> 01:28:31.176]  I mean, Obama says he's going to get rid of torture, then he keeps it going.
[01:28:31.236 --> 01:28:35.097]  Secret arrest, secret internment, no rights for detainees, grab U.S.
[01:28:35.137 --> 01:28:40.139]  citizens, use the Patriot Act on citizens, keep warrantless wiretapping going on, hire nothing but lobbyists.
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.400]  It's all what the Obama deception covers.
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:43.721]  You've got to show it to people.
[01:28:45.762 --> 01:28:49.404]  I love this country so much, folks, and this is hardcore tyranny.
[01:28:50.424 --> 01:28:51.585]  I mean, this is the real deal.
[01:28:51.625 --> 01:28:52.385]  Listen to this, Bill.
[01:28:54.974 --> 01:29:01.039]  And little old InfoWars, little old Kurt Nemo gets an email from a listener pointing out the bill and writes a story about it Sunday night.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.421]  The NRA isn't going to talk about it.
[01:29:03.461 --> 01:29:04.983]  Nobody's going to talk about it, folks, but us.
[01:29:07.705 --> 01:29:14.751]  And on May 13th, Democrat Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced the No Fly, No Buy Act.
[01:29:14.771 --> 01:29:18.874]  See, we told you last week this other bill could do that because the language allowed them to.
[01:29:18.974 --> 01:29:19.975]  This states it!
[01:29:20.315 --> 01:29:22.137]  They got three bills to do this!
[01:29:24.005 --> 01:29:26.346]  There's the White House Chief of Staff calling for it to be passed.
[01:29:27.827 --> 01:29:29.228]  What more do you need, man?
[01:29:30.289 --> 01:29:31.430]  They'll still be in denial, though.
[01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:32.871]  They're trained to be slaves.
[01:29:34.272 --> 01:29:38.614]  On May 13th, Democrat Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced the No Fly, No Buy Act, H.R. 2401.
[01:29:40.888 --> 01:29:48.391]  A bill that will merge the TSA's no-fly list, with over 1,100,000 Americans, with the National Institute of Criminal Background Check System, NICS.
[01:29:49.031 --> 01:29:50.011]  And this is already in place.
[01:29:50.111 --> 01:29:56.594]  Veterans, conservatives, people try to go buy guns, they're told, sorry, and then they go through the appeals process and they say, sorry, no more Second Amendment.
[01:29:57.854 --> 01:30:02.556]  See, guilty until proven innocent, then they appeal it and they're told, you can't be told why you don't get a gun, sorry.
[01:30:02.796 --> 01:30:03.856]  It's already happened.
[01:30:04.076 --> 01:30:08.258]  Just like they were already spying on us without warrants before they passed a law to do it.
[01:30:10.014 --> 01:30:13.320]  Last time I heard, bastards, you didn't repeal the Fourth Amendment.
[01:30:14.122 --> 01:30:14.703]  You're criminals.
[01:30:14.723 --> 01:30:15.284]  You're rogue.
[01:30:15.584 --> 01:30:17.568]  You can pass a law saying blacks aren't humans.
[01:30:17.909 --> 01:30:18.570]  It's a fraud.
[01:30:19.491 --> 01:30:20.493]  I'm calling you out.
[01:30:20.553 --> 01:30:22.277]  You're a stinking criminal fraud.
[01:30:24.324 --> 01:30:30.027]  On May 3rd, Democratic Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced the No-Fly, No-Buy Act, H.R.
[01:30:30.047 --> 01:30:39.372]  2401, a bill that will merge the TSA's No-Fly list with the National Instance Criminal Background Check System, a point-of-sale system for determining eligibility to purchase a firearm in the United States.
[01:30:39.432 --> 01:30:40.293]  Guam, Puerto Rico.
[01:30:40.313 --> 01:30:50.238]  It was created November of 1993, when the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 93, Public Law 103-159, was signed into law.
[01:30:50.859 --> 01:30:52.660]  Permanent revisions of the Brady Act went into effect
[01:30:53.499 --> 01:30:55.781]  November 30th, 1998, and require the U.S.
[01:30:55.801 --> 01:30:58.642]  Attorney General to establish NICS, NICS.
[01:31:00.844 --> 01:31:02.805]  And she goes on with a quote, and we have the bill.
[01:31:03.306 --> 01:31:11.851]  It says, we will secretly put you on this list, you will no longer be able to buy firearms, and the states are going to be implemented that you have guns illegal, and the SWAT teams are coming.
[01:31:12.131 --> 01:31:15.554]  So now you just aren't able to go on a plane, you know, old guy on a walker, I've seen it.
[01:31:15.854 --> 01:31:16.915]  I'm on no-fly list?
[01:31:16.995 --> 01:31:17.195]  Yep.
[01:31:18.393 --> 01:31:20.714]  And they call you in and ask you questions and jab you in.
[01:31:21.174 --> 01:31:28.217]  It's all about take your shoes off, be a slave, answer questions, go on a body scanner, humiliate yourself, be trained to be a slave.
[01:31:31.078 --> 01:31:35.420]  And it says improve homeland security sections, governmenttrack.us.
[01:31:37.657 --> 01:31:45.683]  He increased public safety and reduced the threat of domestic security threat by including persons who may be prevented from boarding an aircraft of the National Instant Criminal Background System.
[01:31:45.703 --> 01:31:51.326]  So see, no judge, no jury, no arrest, no misdemeanor, no felony, no indictment, no nothing!
[01:31:51.366 --> 01:31:51.667]  You just...
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:53.220]  Secret list.
[01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:53.981]  No more rights.
[01:31:54.641 --> 01:31:55.582]  And folks, here's the key.
[01:31:55.642 --> 01:31:56.542]  It's going to be for everything.
[01:31:56.562 --> 01:31:58.203]  For buying, for selling, for jobs.
[01:31:58.723 --> 01:32:06.567]  This global system, just like Michael Savage can't go to England or Europe, just like I can't go to Canada, they're going to put us all on these global lists where we can't travel.
[01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:07.788]  This is only the beginning.
[01:32:07.828 --> 01:32:08.508]  They've stated it.
[01:32:08.748 --> 01:32:09.409]  That's the key.
[01:32:10.993 --> 01:32:19.361]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:32:19.641 --> 01:32:24.045]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[01:32:24.486 --> 01:32:29.671]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[01:33:11.497 --> 01:33:14.058]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:33:14.685 --> 01:33:16.809]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:24.322]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:33:24.893 --> 01:33:31.075]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:33:31.475 --> 01:33:33.315]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:33:33.455 --> 01:33:35.876]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:33:35.956 --> 01:33:46.899]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:33:47.521 --> 01:33:48.802]  It's not about left or right.
[01:33:49.182 --> 01:33:50.582]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:57.405]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:34:06.228 --> 01:34:07.388]  The Obama Deception.
[01:34:07.788 --> 01:34:08.989]  The people strike back.
[01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:17.931]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:34:18.171 --> 01:34:22.455]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:34:22.715 --> 01:34:27.819]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:35.406]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:34:35.846 --> 01:34:40.813]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[01:34:41.233 --> 01:34:46.700]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:34:47.101 --> 01:34:52.548]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[01:35:02.657 --> 01:35:07.281]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:08.903]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:35:20.526 --> 01:35:27.350]  You know, I saw an article quoting Richard Stallman about attacks on the Internet and its infrastructure and free speech.
[01:35:27.971 --> 01:35:40.998]  I told my producer to get him on, and when the two IT guys here at the office found out about it, they were very giddy today, because this guy is quite a bigwig in the architecture of browsers, the Internet, you name it.
[01:35:41.959 --> 01:35:46.522]  Richard Stallman, GNU Linux inventor.
[01:35:48.183 --> 01:35:49.463]  Richard Matthew Stallman,
[01:35:51.019 --> 01:35:56.163]  Often abbreviated RMS is an American software freedom activist, hacker, and software developer.
[01:35:56.844 --> 01:36:04.470]  In September 83, he launched the GNU project to create a free Unix-like operating system and has been the project's lead architect and organizer.
[01:36:04.750 --> 01:36:11.936]  With the launch of the GNU project, he started the free software movement and in October 1985, set up the Free Software Foundation.
[01:36:12.116 --> 01:36:18.842]  You know what, if I go over his whole bio, we'll never get to him, but this is one of the, you know, I know they say Al Gore invented the internet, even though it was around
[01:36:19.605 --> 01:36:20.846]  You know, 30 years ago.
[01:36:20.866 --> 01:36:24.507]  And I know they say he probably invented the moon, actually, and the galaxy.
[01:36:24.887 --> 01:36:31.530]  But, you know, we talk about some of the folks that have actually really contributed to the infrastructure of the free web, as we know it.
[01:36:32.271 --> 01:36:35.852]  This guy is certainly an icon in what we know as the modern web, Richard Stallman.
[01:36:35.872 --> 01:36:41.755]  I want to get him on because they're trying to get rid of net neutrality, they're trying to change how the web works, the head of cybersecurity.
[01:36:42.295 --> 01:36:43.495]  He quit two months ago.
[01:36:44.036 --> 01:36:44.596]  We talked to him.
[01:36:44.616 --> 01:36:46.077]  He said he's not ready to come on the air right now.
[01:36:46.157 --> 01:37:01.002]  He's behind the scenes stuff, but he said the Feds are taking it over, the Pentagon's taking over the web, and then it came out in the news that they are taking over the actual hubs of even smaller, you know, internet, telecom systems.
[01:37:01.443 --> 01:37:04.164]  So to try to break all this down with us is Richard Stallman.
[01:37:04.604 --> 01:37:09.366]  Richard, so much is going on, and we've got you for about 45 minutes or so.
[01:37:10.726 --> 01:37:11.807]  It's great to have you here with us.
[01:37:12.878 --> 01:37:14.739]  Well, I'm pleased to have a chance again.
[01:37:15.459 --> 01:37:15.860]  You bet.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.720]  Okay, you've got the floor.
[01:37:17.761 --> 01:37:19.001]  What do you think is most important?
[01:37:19.021 --> 01:37:25.444]  I mean, you've dedicated your, you know, entire professional career to liberty and freedom on this wonderful thing we call the Internet.
[01:37:26.725 --> 01:37:27.546]  How did it start?
[01:37:27.666 --> 01:37:28.446]  Where are we going?
[01:37:29.346 --> 01:37:31.568]  Well, first, I have to correct a couple of things.
[01:37:32.108 --> 01:37:34.949]  I've never worked on web browsers myself.
[01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:41.813]  I'm happy to say that there are some free, freedom-respecting web browsers, but I didn't write any of them.
[01:37:42.222 --> 01:37:49.565]  No, what I meant was just setting up an infrastructure, but I mean the group they have here that you set up is involved in a whole bunch of stuff is my point, but go ahead.
[01:37:49.985 --> 01:38:06.811]  Yes, we developed, first of all, the GNU operating system, which gets used together with Linux, the kernel, and that's the main freedom respecting operating system that lets you use your computer without handing over control to some company.
[01:38:07.751 --> 01:38:07.931]  Now,
[01:38:08.701 --> 01:38:22.611]  We know that Microsoft Windows has a backdoor that allows Microsoft to forcibly impose changes in software without asking permission of the supposed owner of the machine.
[01:38:23.272 --> 01:38:30.577]  And we know that Mac OS has a similar backdoor, except that it's Apple that can forcibly impose changes.
[01:38:30.938 --> 01:38:37.883]  They can change anything they want in the software, which means they can wipe the floor with whoever is using that machine.
[01:38:38.872 --> 01:38:47.139]  So, in effect, these two systems have no security at all against that particular company.
[01:38:47.579 --> 01:38:48.420]  And then we see U.S.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:59.208]  Senators coming out, a real-life example of this, saying, oh, we'll just make it where if we think you downloaded music illegally or videos, no court, no jury, we'll just, quote, fry your computer.
[01:38:59.609 --> 01:39:01.710]  That's where all this remote access comes in.
[01:39:01.730 --> 01:39:03.152]  And there's so many things we could talk about.
[01:39:03.952 --> 01:39:05.513]  But, I mean, please continue with...
[01:39:07.925 --> 01:39:12.526]  Because I've seen them now trying to move towards making it where everything you have is on a remote server.
[01:39:12.826 --> 01:39:17.127]  Your computers, you know, are no longer even really operable by themselves.
[01:39:17.147 --> 01:39:18.227]  They just become terminals.
[01:39:18.507 --> 01:39:19.147]  Please continue.
[01:39:19.847 --> 01:39:30.109]  Well, these are both part of the desire to regain control over what we do with our computers and with the Internet.
[01:39:30.729 --> 01:39:32.110]  And these are not the only ways.
[01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:33.610]  Of course, they're bad.
[01:39:35.166 --> 01:39:44.113]  In fact, a PC today, any PC today, is pretty powerful compared with the machines that people were using 10 years ago.
[01:39:44.833 --> 01:39:56.962]  And the disks that they're making today are so big, why would you ever feel you need to store your data someplace other than in your own computer or your own office or your own bedroom?
[01:39:58.717 --> 01:40:04.521]  You can't even get the disks nowadays that I used to think were very big ten years ago.
[01:40:05.022 --> 01:40:06.803]  Now they don't make anything that small.
[01:40:07.564 --> 01:40:26.799]  So we should resist this tendency and I think it's a sort of marketing hype phenomenon and buzzwords are being invented including the term cloud computing which is so nebulous that nobody can really tell what it means.
[01:40:27.605 --> 01:40:31.007]  It means a different thing depending on who's using it.
[01:40:31.868 --> 01:40:34.069]  So it's not really a coherent thing to talk about.
[01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:36.391]  And so I won't say anything about it.
[01:40:36.971 --> 01:40:45.937]  But storing some data on servers is not necessarily a bad thing when it's part of a... when you're publishing it.
[01:40:47.097 --> 01:40:52.541]  When it's, for instance, something you want to put on a web server so everybody can see it.
[01:40:53.499 --> 01:40:55.400]  There's no great harm that's possible.
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:41:00.684]  They are the worst that anyone could do to it is delete it and turn it off.
[01:41:01.845 --> 01:41:02.725]  And you'd know that.
[01:41:03.566 --> 01:41:09.610]  Of course, mainly that's likely to happen if somebody with power is mistreating you, but they can always do that.
[01:41:10.291 --> 01:41:16.955]  So the point is, there's no particular harm from if you want to publish something from putting it on some server somewhere.
[01:41:17.556 --> 01:41:19.317]  But when you don't want to publish it,
[01:41:20.385 --> 01:41:25.612]  Then the only way to keep it privately is to keep it in your disk.
[01:41:27.006 --> 01:41:31.167]  And to use your copy of free software to do your computing.
[01:41:31.507 --> 01:41:38.068]  Well, Mr. Stallman, you know, we can kind of get into the detailed minutiae of this, and I want to do that in the limited time we have with you today, and we respect your time.
[01:41:38.828 --> 01:41:55.391]  How about the big picture of what the infrastructure, the architecture of the web has been, what the establishment and, you know, is fighting to change it over to where they have control versus what you, you know, somebody who's really fought for, you know, true freedom on the Internet, should be?
[01:41:56.943 --> 01:42:00.504]  Well, we see a lot of ways in which people are trying to take more control.
[01:42:01.144 --> 01:42:04.425]  Software as a service is one of these ways.
[01:42:05.406 --> 01:42:12.628]  In order for you to have control of your computing, you've got to do it with your copy of a free program.
[01:42:13.268 --> 01:42:20.210]  If a program you use isn't free, freedom respecting that is, that means the developer controls it and the users don't.
[01:42:20.650 --> 01:42:23.111]  So that way you've lost control over your computing.
[01:42:23.965 --> 01:42:29.810]  But if you're doing your computing in somebody else's server, you've also lost control.
[01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:36.075]  Because that means you're using his copy of the program, whatever program it is, not your copy.
[01:42:36.415 --> 01:42:38.537]  So he has control over it, and you don't.
[01:42:39.337 --> 01:42:49.726]  So the way to prevent that from happening to you is, insist on doing your computing in your computer with your copy of a free program.
[01:42:50.367 --> 01:42:51.248]  Well, here's an example.
[01:42:52.069 --> 01:42:58.475]  I was talking to an IT person for the biggest grocery chain in the nation.
[01:42:58.875 --> 01:43:02.058]  They have, I think, 25 different chains under them.
[01:43:02.799 --> 01:43:11.828]  He didn't want me to say the name, but he listed and sent me documents of the German company, and then I search-engined it and found the German company that's running more than half
[01:43:12.248 --> 01:43:12.448]  I think?
[01:43:29.332 --> 01:43:29.933]  I guess they don't, you see.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.304]  They're not used to thinking in terms of maintaining control over their own computing.
[01:43:54.745 --> 01:44:02.852]  Now, this is a paradoxical case because some big companies, just by being big, have power that's dangerous to democracy.
[01:44:03.693 --> 01:44:06.795]  But suppose the business isn't so big.
[01:44:06.815 --> 01:44:08.096]  Well, then it's not dangerous.
[01:44:08.477 --> 01:44:16.484]  And the point is, the business is probably going to use computers, and it deserves to have control over its own computing, just as you and I do.
[01:44:17.168 --> 01:44:18.629]  And so they're vulnerable to this.
[01:44:19.089 --> 01:44:26.111]  But the propaganda of business says, just think of short-term profit.
[01:44:26.631 --> 01:44:29.972]  Don't think of anybody's long-term interest, not even your own.
[01:44:31.132 --> 01:44:41.676]  So this is why it's so common that if you let a corporation own some kind of permanent useful thing, the corporation will strip it.
[01:44:42.196 --> 01:44:44.156]  Because it's looking for short-term profit.
[01:44:44.536 --> 01:44:46.077]  That's one of the problems of our
[01:44:46.770 --> 01:44:50.272]  economic system that we have wedged ourselves into.
[01:44:50.692 --> 01:44:52.493]  That's what they're doing now with the automakers.
[01:44:52.533 --> 01:44:57.115]  They're forcing them to sell off in pieces and literally strip mine it.
[01:44:57.416 --> 01:45:09.962]  What about net neutrality and how they're saying with Internet2 you'll have a subdomain like on a MySpace or a YouTube and that then they're going to try, Internet2 claims their own documents.
[01:45:10.202 --> 01:45:13.503]  I don't know about this, but I know a lot of people will fight it.
[01:45:13.523 --> 01:45:19.944]  For instance, the Free Software Foundation is not going to start posting its stuff through somebody else's server.
[01:45:20.044 --> 01:45:20.804]  We run our own servers.
[01:45:40.296 --> 01:45:43.599]  And I hope that other people will continue to do so.
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:46:04.154]  So basically, the more we build the original, real, true web, so it's really a battle of architecture then, and then we choose, just like you would choose to buy organic food to then build that market so you have more choices, we choose to use the open license software and things?
[01:46:04.853 --> 01:46:07.394]  Well, of course, I'm not in favor of making software open.
[01:46:07.814 --> 01:46:10.735]  I speak of free software because it's freedom respecting.
[01:46:10.955 --> 01:46:11.415]  Sure, sure.
[01:46:11.676 --> 01:46:17.118]  There are other people who are basically the people who like this software, but they don't want to talk about freedom.
[01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:26.701]  They coined another term, which is, quote, open source, unquote, which is a way they can promote their views where they don't want to talk about that issue.
[01:46:26.841 --> 01:46:28.242]  So it's all a semantical fight.
[01:46:28.922 --> 01:46:30.523]  Well, thank you for educating me.
[01:46:32.263 --> 01:46:33.924]  Back to the point that you raised.
[01:46:34.617 --> 01:46:51.600]  Yes, we can choose by what we do, whether to use these massive corporate, invite everybody to put their data into these mega servers, or we can choose otherwise.
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.721]  But we have to organize politically too.
[01:46:54.561 --> 01:47:00.502]  We can't expect individual choice and market mechanisms to always protect our freedom.
[01:47:00.802 --> 01:47:02.783]  We have to organize to protect our freedom.
[01:47:02.983 --> 01:47:04.103]  We have to do it intentionally.
[01:47:04.431 --> 01:47:05.392]  All right, stay there, sir.
[01:47:05.472 --> 01:47:06.533]  Amazing information.
[01:47:06.573 --> 01:47:10.778]  Can't wait to get into some other topics with you and talk about the organization as well.
[01:47:10.898 --> 01:47:19.989]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infections?
[01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:28.213]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites, and your doctor would never know it.
[01:47:28.333 --> 01:47:32.855]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[01:47:32.935 --> 01:47:35.537]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[01:47:35.677 --> 01:47:42.420]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized
[01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:43.301]  I think so.
[01:48:11.758 --> 01:48:14.461]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[01:48:14.861 --> 01:48:21.409]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[01:48:21.429 --> 01:48:26.114]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[01:48:26.698 --> 01:48:36.264]  Call me at 800-686-2237 extension 115 and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[01:48:36.684 --> 01:48:46.389]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:50.372]  Call me Duane Daly at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[01:48:54.654 --> 01:48:57.555]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[01:48:58.075 --> 01:49:00.356]  No amount is too small, so start today.
[01:49:00.837 --> 01:49:09.600]  Call Duane Daly with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[01:49:12.021 --> 01:49:17.243]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:49:18.047 --> 01:49:23.392]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:49:23.932 --> 01:49:30.118]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:49:30.458 --> 01:49:32.239]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.782]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:49:34.862 --> 01:49:45.731]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:49:48.032 --> 01:49:49.293]  It's not about left or right.
[01:49:49.693 --> 01:49:51.095]  It's about a one world government.
[01:49:51.555 --> 01:49:57.880]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:49:58.461 --> 01:50:06.247]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:06.727 --> 01:50:07.888]  The Obama Deception.
[01:50:08.309 --> 01:50:09.490]  The people strike back.
[01:50:11.257 --> 01:50:12.458]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:50:12.638 --> 01:50:14.899]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:50:15.039 --> 01:50:19.042]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:50:19.202 --> 01:50:22.884]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:50:22.964 --> 01:50:31.429]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:50:31.529 --> 01:50:35.151]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:50:35.371 --> 01:50:40.594]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call
[01:50:46.175 --> 01:50:46.435]  I think so.
[01:51:23.682 --> 01:51:26.103]  Richard Stallman's our guest, internet icon.
[01:51:26.464 --> 01:51:37.871]  Sir, is it better to just have folks go to GNU.org, the foundation there, or what are some other sites folks can visit to read your writings and analysis and breakdowns?
[01:51:39.192 --> 01:51:45.376]  GNU.org, GNU.org, is the website about the GNU system and the free software movement.
[01:51:46.276 --> 01:51:50.559]  The Free Software Foundation has a website, FFF.org.
[01:51:51.192 --> 01:52:08.999]  And there you can find things like resource information, lists of useful free programs, lists of hardware devices that don't require any non-free programs, people who provide support as a business for free software, and other useful things.
[01:52:09.319 --> 01:52:14.682]  And you could also join the Free Software Foundation, which is the main way that we pay our staff.
[01:52:15.502 --> 01:52:17.963]  Now, I'm a volunteer, but the staff get paid.
[01:52:18.539 --> 01:52:23.305]  Sure, folks should definitely join that because we probably wouldn't have as much freedom as we have now if it wasn't for you guys.
[01:52:23.906 --> 01:52:25.528]  You know, again, I'm no IT guy.
[01:52:25.568 --> 01:52:26.810]  I can barely send an email.
[01:52:27.851 --> 01:52:33.258]  But just because I do lease a lot of servers and CDNs and own some, I know some about it.
[01:52:34.259 --> 01:52:36.582]  And always talking to IT people, you know, they talk about how
[01:52:37.631 --> 01:52:50.036]  The free software that you're discussing, and they semantically call it open source to try to take away the branding and semantically control it, is a lot harder to break into, a lot harder for people to control.
[01:52:50.176 --> 01:52:51.236]  It works a lot better.
[01:52:51.476 --> 01:52:57.818]  Because Microsoft and everybody else, they want everything set up so they can backdoor it, they can control it.
[01:52:58.039 --> 01:53:00.719]  That also leaves the doors open to other bad guys, doesn't it?
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:03.701]  Well sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.
[01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:09.812]  Because I won't claim that every non-free program is badly written.
[01:53:09.832 --> 01:53:12.313]  You know, those people are not all stupid.
[01:53:12.393 --> 01:53:13.694]  Some of them are very capable.
[01:53:14.194 --> 01:53:16.015]  It's just that they don't respect your freedom.
[01:53:16.936 --> 01:53:24.259]  So, it's true, however, quite often they have very bad security, even against third parties.
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:32.823]  For instance, with cell phones, there are viruses that can get into cell phones.
[01:53:33.724 --> 01:53:33.864]  So,
[01:53:34.691 --> 01:53:46.318]  They can then invoke the cell phone's ability to turn on as a listening device without ringing, without showing any sign that it's making a call.
[01:53:46.798 --> 01:53:54.843]  It's still listening to the sound that comes in to the microphone, like whatever conversation you're having with people, and sending that to whoever.
[01:53:56.784 --> 01:54:00.267]  But you may be safer if you use a cell phone.
[01:54:01.187 --> 01:54:02.488]  That's all free software.
[01:54:03.789 --> 01:54:04.590]  And there are some.
[01:54:05.411 --> 01:54:07.173]  There is the OpenMoko phone.
[01:54:07.594 --> 01:54:09.396]  I don't know how well that's working yet.
[01:54:10.076 --> 01:54:16.424]  And I think if you get the professional version of the Google phone, then that's really free software.
[01:54:16.924 --> 01:54:19.027]  Although I'm not sure all of it is free software.
[01:54:20.706 --> 01:54:21.266]  Amazing.
[01:54:21.666 --> 01:54:22.567]  Long segment coming up.
[01:54:22.587 --> 01:54:24.108]  This one's short, but another question.
[01:54:25.148 --> 01:54:39.755]  And again, all these IT people and hackers send me this stuff, and it's mainline Pentagon reports and Air Force, Cyber Command, San Antonio, and it's the general commanding their forces to attack our own Internet, to test its strengths and weaknesses, and then
[01:54:40.575 --> 01:54:51.421]  I've seen, hackers have told me and I've seen some blurbs about how it's really the government hacking the hospitals and hacking power plants to then have a pretext to bring in more of their own control.
[01:54:51.762 --> 01:54:59.206]  Are you familiar with government's false flagging or staging attacks on their own systems as a pretext to get more funding and control?
[01:54:59.766 --> 01:55:05.550]  Well, I don't know about any instances of that on the internet.
[01:55:06.691 --> 01:55:08.632]  That's not what I specialize in.
[01:55:09.710 --> 01:55:17.434]  I haven't read about, I haven't read news about a thing like that that I recall, but it wouldn't surprise me that much.
[01:55:17.454 --> 01:55:35.704]  I mean, if you could have the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and you could have the supposed weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, then I guess, why wouldn't they lie about who is, you know, I wouldn't put it past them.
[01:55:36.269 --> 01:55:41.331]  To stage such an attack and lie about it, but that doesn't mean that I know that they're doing so.
[01:55:41.872 --> 01:55:43.933]  Sure, yeah, that really wasn't in the news.
[01:55:43.953 --> 01:55:45.113]  I mean, there were a few stories.
[01:55:45.533 --> 01:55:50.256]  It's mainly bizarre, hour-long video briefings with the Air Force and people.
[01:55:51.016 --> 01:55:58.280]  And, I mean, I'm sure you did hear about the head of cybersecurity a couple months ago quit and said, the Feds are taking over the web, I won't be part of this.
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:03.042]  I mean, when their own head of cybersecurity quits, I think we have a big problem here.
[01:56:04.113 --> 01:56:07.998]  Yeah, I didn't read about that, and now that I've heard it from you, I'll take a look.
[01:56:08.838 --> 01:56:13.103]  Now there's so much going on, I can't keep track of it all either, and it was only in a few articles.
[01:56:14.365 --> 01:56:17.348]  When we come back, I want to talk about how do we save the internet?
[01:56:17.368 --> 01:56:18.209]  How do we expand it?
[01:56:18.489 --> 01:56:22.874]  How do we make it more free versus the architecture that it seems to be leaning towards?
[01:56:23.275 --> 01:56:24.697]  Go ahead and start down those lines, sir.
[01:56:25.703 --> 01:56:30.948]  Well, my work will help you make sure that your computer is under your control.
[01:56:31.409 --> 01:56:36.234]  But beyond that, there's nothing that each one of us can directly do.
[01:56:36.874 --> 01:56:48.526]  So if there's censorship or if there is, say, surveillance going on in the Internet that connects you to me,
[01:56:49.803 --> 01:56:53.467]  Neither you nor I can simply make a change to turn that off.
[01:56:53.988 --> 01:56:57.312]  The only way I know of we could stop that... Well, stay there!
[01:56:57.692 --> 01:56:58.693]  Gotta break!
[01:56:58.753 --> 01:57:00.074]  Sorry to interrupt, gotta break for the satellite.
[01:57:01.156 --> 01:57:02.057]  We're on the march.
[01:57:02.557 --> 01:57:04.139]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:07.763]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:10.814 --> 01:57:12.396]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:57:12.516 --> 01:57:17.122]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:57:17.263 --> 01:57:20.006]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:57:20.227 --> 01:57:23.090]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:57:23.271 --> 01:57:27.977]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:57:28.197 --> 01:57:29.138]  If you simply prepare.
[01:57:29.318 --> 01:57:32.300]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation that you do.
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:39.486]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:57:39.566 --> 01:57:42.708]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:57:42.848 --> 01:57:43.048]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:57:43.108 --> 01:57:44.389]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:57:48.052 --> 01:57:51.014]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:58:17.148 --> 01:58:24.173]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:58:24.733 --> 01:58:30.938]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:58:31.318 --> 01:58:33.139]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:58:33.299 --> 01:58:35.721]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:58:35.801 --> 01:58:46.749]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:58:47.367 --> 01:58:48.648]  It's not about left or right.
[01:58:49.029 --> 01:58:50.450]  It's about a one world government.
[01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:57.236]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:58:57.817 --> 01:59:05.604]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:06.064 --> 01:59:07.225]  The Obama Deception.
[01:59:07.646 --> 01:59:08.847]  The people strike back.
[01:59:10.794 --> 01:59:14.058]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:59:14.298 --> 01:59:18.624]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:59:18.824 --> 01:59:26.714]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:59:27.014 --> 01:59:29.855]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:59:30.135 --> 01:59:37.657]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:59:37.757 --> 01:59:43.339]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:59:43.579 --> 01:59:49.142]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:59:49.422 --> 01:59:52.723]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:59:52.963 --> 01:59:56.325]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:59:56.565 --> 02:00:01.607]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt-cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:00:01.627 --> 02:00:04.489]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:00:04.509 --> 02:00:04.709]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:00:26.121 --> 02:00:30.584]  Well, we really appreciate Richard Stallman joining us.
[02:00:30.624 --> 02:00:32.125]  We'll give you the website tonight.
[02:00:32.165 --> 02:00:33.246]  Get involved and donate.
[02:00:34.146 --> 02:00:35.367]  Be part of the organization.
[02:00:37.968 --> 02:00:39.890]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, those are the Lakotas.
[02:00:40.450 --> 02:00:43.111]  I didn't lie when I told you these are the prettiest silver coins I've ever seen.
[02:00:43.612 --> 02:00:45.033]  Put out by the Native American Nation.
[02:00:45.413 --> 02:00:47.294]  Tell you about those in the last two minutes of the show today.
[02:00:47.594 --> 02:00:48.335]  Look at those babies.
[02:00:48.815 --> 02:00:50.976]  No wonder that's the best-selling silver coin out there right now.
[02:00:51.456 --> 02:00:51.817]  All right.
[02:00:53.609 --> 02:00:54.569]  We'll tell you about a few sponsors.
[02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:57.210]  We're going back to Mr. Stallman.
[02:00:57.230 --> 02:00:59.772]  Again, the website is GNU.org.
[02:00:59.792 --> 02:01:01.152]  We'll give you some of the others as well.
[02:01:01.552 --> 02:01:11.336]  I suggest everybody out there start fighting for the internet, for freedom of computing, because there is no doubt what Jay Rockefeller is saying, we'd be better off not having an internet, that these guys mean business.
[02:01:11.356 --> 02:01:15.238]  Before we go back to our guest, AcolaBlue.com is one of our great sponsors.
[02:01:16.354 --> 02:01:27.417]  Atmospheric water generator in your own home grabs the neutral pH water out of the air, then passes it through seven filters, including carbon, reverse osmosis, and antibacterial antifungal UV light.
[02:01:27.817 --> 02:01:29.858]  Check out more at Ecoloblue.com.
[02:01:30.018 --> 02:01:32.679]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, or 1-800-691-6043.
[02:01:32.699 --> 02:01:32.739]  1-800-691.
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:37.701]  60-43.
[02:01:37.721 --> 02:01:40.523]  And another great sponsor is Pepperspray.com.
[02:01:40.583 --> 02:01:44.146]  You know, a lot of cities and counties and states have restrictions on the Second Amendment.
[02:01:44.447 --> 02:01:49.191]  People send their wives and daughters and sons out in their apartments or homes unarmed.
[02:01:49.871 --> 02:01:50.792]  I believe in tasers.
[02:01:50.912 --> 02:01:51.813]  I believe in stun guns.
[02:01:51.853 --> 02:01:52.734]  I believe in pepper spray.
[02:01:52.774 --> 02:01:53.895]  I believe in non-lethal
[02:01:54.435 --> 02:01:55.175]  Self-defense.
[02:01:55.515 --> 02:02:03.237]  And as the economy implodes and home invasions explode, it is now time, if you don't want a firearm, to get a high-quality mace gun, pepper spray.
[02:02:03.257 --> 02:02:05.457]  They've got so many products around since 1994.
[02:02:05.837 --> 02:02:09.898]  The best company out there, the best prices, free shipping on orders above $99.
[02:02:11.059 --> 02:02:13.239]  Check them out, ladies and gentlemen, at Pepperspray.
[02:02:13.339 --> 02:02:14.619]  One word, Pepperspray.com or 1-800-908-9988.
[02:02:14.639 --> 02:02:14.719]  1-800-908-9988.
[02:02:14.739 --> 02:02:14.799]  1-800-908-9988.
[02:02:22.501 --> 02:02:31.724]  Okay, let's go back to Richard Stallman, who invented the GNU Linux system, has a big free software internet freedom organization.
[02:02:31.764 --> 02:02:35.305]  Again, sir, I'm literally a troglodyte when it comes to all these terms.
[02:02:35.665 --> 02:02:42.167]  Again, reintroduce yourself for folks that don't know, and I'm just going to sit back, shut up, and hear what your solutions are, ways to fight this.
[02:02:42.187 --> 02:02:46.729]  You got cut off by the break with how do we stop the government, governments,
[02:02:47.429 --> 02:02:50.731]  Well, what I started 25 years ago was developing a free software operating system called GNU.
[02:02:51.031 --> 02:02:55.614]  The idea is free software is software that respects your freedom and you control it.
[02:03:14.013 --> 02:03:21.779]  The users control it individually if they know how and want to go to the trouble, but also the users collectively control it.
[02:03:22.179 --> 02:03:29.485]  Any group of users that want the program to work a certain way, they're free to develop their version which works that way.
[02:03:29.965 --> 02:03:39.132]  Those who know how to program do it, and those who have the same preferences use that version, and if they don't like that version, they use some other version.
[02:03:39.747 --> 02:03:43.408]  And you could also pay people to make the changes you want.
[02:03:43.888 --> 02:03:59.091]  So, for instance, your show, if you wanted to change a free program, well, you personally don't know how, maybe none of your staff knows how, but there are companies that would make those changes, just as there are carpenters you could hire to make changes in your office.
[02:03:59.951 --> 02:04:02.192]  And they'll just do the work the way you want it done.
[02:04:03.130 --> 02:04:09.456]  And if you want to change it again some other day, you can hire somebody else, because nobody has a monopoly.
[02:04:09.936 --> 02:04:13.640]  It's a free market, this business of support for free software.
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:16.042]  And does that allow a kind of evolution?
[02:04:16.062 --> 02:04:23.409]  It seems like where the non-free softwares are stagnant, except for minor changes, this accelerates development, doesn't it?
[02:04:23.989 --> 02:04:25.431]  Well, it may or may not.
[02:04:25.511 --> 02:04:26.472]  I won't claim that all
[02:04:27.108 --> 02:04:28.929]  Non-free programs are stagnant.
[02:04:29.349 --> 02:04:40.874]  That depends how much work the developer is putting in, but regardless of whether it makes fast progress or slow progress, it makes progress in the direction that the developer wants.
[02:04:41.374 --> 02:04:52.899]  And if there's something the developer doesn't want you to be able to do, like for instance, access a certain file more than five times, he'll program it not to let you.
[02:04:54.679 --> 02:05:03.462]  Proprietary programs frequently have these malicious features, which we call Digital Restrictions Management, or DRM, or Digital Handcuffs.
[02:05:04.043 --> 02:05:06.844]  They are designed to stop you from doing things.
[02:05:07.184 --> 02:05:12.166]  So that program may not be your servant, it may be your prison guard.
[02:05:14.287 --> 02:05:17.988]  In any case, these are things that we can take control of ourselves.
[02:05:18.613 --> 02:05:24.836]  We can free ourselves and each other and that's what we've been doing in the free software movement since I started it.
[02:05:25.677 --> 02:05:30.400]  But there are other areas where we just can't solve the problem that way.
[02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:34.542]  Surveillance in the internet service provider.
[02:05:35.042 --> 02:05:43.247]  We can't stop that by choosing to use a different program in our own computers because it's not happening in our computers.
[02:05:43.327 --> 02:05:45.628]  It's happening in some central office.
[02:05:46.397 --> 02:05:57.362]  Now, one thing that helps somewhat is to use programs like the GDU Privacy Guard for encryption of the messages and files we send each other.
[02:05:57.982 --> 02:06:01.684]  But even that, even encryption doesn't do the whole job.
[02:06:02.184 --> 02:06:13.830]  And when there is censorship, you know in Australia, the main organization that fights for civil liberties on the internet, which is Electronic Frontiers Australia, was
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:23.790]  Forced to take down a link that they had put up in a discussion of censorship, showing what kinds of things are getting censored.
[02:06:24.190 --> 02:06:29.876]  Well, they were forced to take down that link on the threat of being fined $11,000 a day.
[02:06:31.758 --> 02:06:32.939]  Yeah, let me back you up on that.
[02:06:32.979 --> 02:06:52.693]  They've announced, the government itself calls it Chinese-style net censorship, and proudly are now issuing hundreds and hundreds of sites, they're now saying thousands, on these lists that you can't visit, you can't link to, and then you can't link and say, look, WikiLeaks, leaking government documents, you can't even say that's been censored.
[02:06:53.154 --> 02:06:55.635]  That's very 1984 Kafka-esque.
[02:06:56.196 --> 02:07:00.579]  Yeah, well, the Australian government has been trashing human rights
[02:07:01.232 --> 02:07:15.307]  For many years, typically in the name of preventing terrorism, as many other governments are doing, you know, any given week their excuse is either terrorists or pedophiles.
[02:07:16.028 --> 02:07:21.734]  But neither of them is anywhere near as dangerous as governments that don't respect our freedom.
[02:07:22.981 --> 02:07:23.641]  Absolutely.
[02:07:23.701 --> 02:07:27.163]  Historically, governments killed 200-something million people last century.
[02:07:27.203 --> 02:07:32.286]  I mean, tyranny has gotten a whole new lease on life.
[02:07:34.284 --> 02:07:36.065]  So, specifically, what do we do?
[02:07:36.126 --> 02:07:45.273]  I mean, if citizens and companies try to go with free software solutions and support groups like yours, what else can we do?
[02:07:45.293 --> 02:07:48.696]  I mean, I guess we vote with our dollars, we vote with our time.
[02:07:48.736 --> 02:07:59.764]  I mean, what... I mean, let's say I'm a company with twenty-something... For centralized surveillance and censorship, they don't let you vote with your time or with your dollars.
[02:08:00.325 --> 02:08:01.626]  Now, if you're in Australia,
[02:08:02.165 --> 02:08:05.153]  And you want to make links to these forbidden sites?
[02:08:05.635 --> 02:08:09.084]  For instance, the political sites that talk about Australian censorship?
[02:08:09.730 --> 02:08:13.351]  But, you can't do that by picking one company over another.
[02:08:13.812 --> 02:08:16.312]  You'd have to put your site outside Australia.
[02:08:16.773 --> 02:08:19.614]  And then maybe Australia wouldn't let anybody link to your site.
[02:08:19.914 --> 02:08:20.834]  Yeah, that's the key.
[02:08:20.954 --> 02:08:23.735]  That's what Australia is saying they're going to do, is block most of the web.
[02:08:23.775 --> 02:08:33.359]  But I mean, that's the key, is that that's what Homeland Security has announced, that they're going to take over all the infrastructure, even of private companies, and as indentured servants, they have to allow
[02:08:34.519 --> 02:08:37.902]  It is, and the solution I've been using is no good for this.
[02:08:37.922 --> 02:08:38.723]  So, what can we do?
[02:08:38.743 --> 02:08:41.405]  We have to organize politically in mass organizations.
[02:09:04.359 --> 02:09:07.002]  The only organization that I know of in the U.S.
[02:09:07.042 --> 02:09:16.552]  that fights against these things is the Electronic Frontier Foundation, although I think the American Civil Liberties Union fights also against some of them.
[02:09:18.213 --> 02:09:20.756]  So both of those organizations deserve your support.
[02:09:23.021 --> 02:09:29.406]  You know, is it that Americans and Australians and British and others have had so much freedom in the past, we can't believe it's happening here?
[02:09:29.846 --> 02:09:33.969]  Or have we lied to ourselves about how much freedom was really in our society?
[02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:38.192]  I think that it's a combination of both.
[02:09:38.893 --> 02:09:46.418]  It's certainly the case that there was much less surveillance of all our communication in the past.
[02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:52.343]  You see, this is one thing that digital technology makes much easier.
[02:09:54.157 --> 02:10:01.182]  In the 1960s, I don't think anything kept track of who you called locally.
[02:10:01.763 --> 02:10:03.504]  The phone exchange didn't keep track.
[02:10:03.905 --> 02:10:08.769]  It just counted up how many calls you made and sometimes how long they were.
[02:10:09.689 --> 02:10:16.835]  The only thing you got on your bill was long distance calls because they were expensive and people wanted to know what they were being billed for.
[02:10:18.337 --> 02:10:22.120]  Now, in France, after World War II,
[02:10:23.590 --> 02:10:29.474]  The government insisted that the phone company must not keep any records of who called whom.
[02:10:29.995 --> 02:10:50.069]  And the reason was that when the Nazis took over France, they looked at those records to see who spoke to whom, and that way if they knew that one person seemed to be possibly a center of political opposition, they would not only arrest him, but they would question all the people he tended to make phone calls to.
[02:10:52.103 --> 02:11:02.893]  After the war, the French government and various other governments in Europe established rules that the phone companies were not allowed to keep track.
[02:11:04.294 --> 02:11:06.236]  However, of course, they've changed all that.
[02:11:07.281 --> 02:11:08.002]  Well, exactly.
[02:11:08.042 --> 02:11:10.745]  I just saw a story in the London Telegraph.
[02:11:10.785 --> 02:11:12.847]  In fact, guys, will you search engine this?
[02:11:13.748 --> 02:11:16.050]  People have corrected me not to just always say Google, Google.
[02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:21.055]  We need to plug Lycos and Scroogle.org and everybody else.
[02:11:21.095 --> 02:11:28.463]  In fact, I'll ask you what you think are some good alternatives, because I think Google is becoming evil, at least from what I've seen.
[02:11:28.483 --> 02:11:29.825]  But it was in the French news.
[02:11:31.047 --> 02:11:42.773]  That people are real mad that a guy's friend sent him a message saying don't blow up the train because he was going on a ride and they were there waiting for him when he got to the train station.
[02:11:42.793 --> 02:11:51.277]  It was another case in an airport where they made a joke in another European country and they admitted they said oh no the phone companies have AI NSA type keyword
[02:11:52.117 --> 02:11:56.760]  Reading all of it, and then flagging it, everything is red.
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:01.423]  And that kind of freaked the French out to realize, but the same thing's going on here now.
[02:12:02.023 --> 02:12:03.524]  This is just so disgusting.
[02:12:04.725 --> 02:12:16.952]  Well, one thing people can do about that is just throw these things randomly into phone calls, the way they do, the way people have done for decades, randomly into their messages.
[02:12:18.999 --> 02:12:29.681]  I don't know if anybody was ever looking for keywords in messages to decide to read them, but if people have fun at least.
[02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:34.472]  Setting up programs that would automatically put such keywords into their mail.
[02:12:34.512 --> 02:12:38.734]  No, the NSA admits they do that, and that's one of the 20-year-old technologies, as I'm sure you know.
[02:12:38.754 --> 02:12:52.160]  You're being humbled, but no, I mean, in fact, there was articles in like 2002 where they were complaining that citizens... What's the term for that where I say, yeah, I got the football, I got the green stuff.
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.241]  Yeah, did you hear about that nuke that's going to go off?
[02:12:54.281 --> 02:12:55.262]  Yeah, I'll tell you what else.
[02:12:55.802 --> 02:13:00.024]  Well, I hope so, because if we keep them busy enough, maybe they won't attack us as much.
[02:13:00.044 --> 02:13:01.945]  But I have a feeling that that won't solve the problem.
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:36.189]  I don't see anything that's going to solve this problem except talking about freedom and demanding freedom and condemning the government to tax on our freedom and rejecting the excuses.
[02:13:36.990 --> 02:13:38.111]  So it's political will.
[02:13:38.151 --> 02:13:41.313]  We've got to recognize tyranny when it's in front of our nose.
[02:13:42.094 --> 02:13:45.496]  That's the only solution I can see, if it's a solution.
[02:13:45.836 --> 02:13:46.977]  It's not going to be easy.
[02:13:47.097 --> 02:13:52.281]  I wish I knew some clever technical method that could protect our freedom.
[02:13:53.286 --> 02:14:03.335]  I was lucky, you know, in one particular area I saw a way that through technical work we could protect our freedom, but only particular aspects of our freedom.
[02:14:03.996 --> 02:14:06.518]  All the others, well, they're different.
[02:14:08.715 --> 02:14:09.395]  Absolutely.
[02:14:09.475 --> 02:14:09.815]  Wow.
[02:14:10.275 --> 02:14:12.456]  Well, we're really appreciative of your time, sir.
[02:14:12.956 --> 02:14:26.598]  Other facets, other points that people should be made aware of from your research and others' research that are real threats to freedom right now, because it seems not just threats, we have this surveillance being institutionalized to where there's just no such thing as a Fourth Amendment.
[02:14:27.558 --> 02:14:27.838]  Yes.
[02:14:29.239 --> 02:14:37.200]  We see the logic for reasoning about privacy rights is screwed up in the U.S.
[02:14:38.421 --> 02:14:40.383]  It may have worked okay in the past.
[02:14:42.064 --> 02:14:48.308]  The argument usually is if a policeman could see it from the street, then he's got a right to look.
[02:14:48.889 --> 02:14:52.711]  And that made sense, sort of, in 1960.
[02:14:53.532 --> 02:15:04.900]  But now, with computers that can record so much data, if it's okay for the police to set up cameras and other kinds of sensors,
[02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:06.260]  Everywhere.
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:16.427]  To keep track of everything that a policeman could theoretically have possibly seen from a public place about you and put all that together.
[02:15:16.928 --> 02:15:18.369]  Then he knows everything about you.
[02:15:19.437 --> 02:15:21.278]  Yeah, and the pendulum's going the wrong way.
[02:15:21.738 --> 02:15:22.538]  Well, look at London.
[02:15:22.598 --> 02:15:30.342]  Four million cameras, and now they've made it illegal to videotape the police, and they walk up and threaten to arrest tourists now videotaping monuments.
[02:15:30.822 --> 02:15:37.205]  I mean, you know, government is way out of control because private corporate interests have turned government into nothing but their little lapdogs.
[02:15:37.885 --> 02:15:46.929]  Yes, and a large part of the cause of this, actually, is so-called free trade treaties, which I'd rather call low-wage treaties.
[02:15:47.907 --> 02:15:55.492]  Because these treaties take the power from governments and give them to businesses.
[02:15:56.233 --> 02:16:02.337]  The businesses say to the governments, if you don't do exactly what we want, we'll move to some other country.
[02:16:03.017 --> 02:16:08.121]  And the governments respond by saying, oh yes, we'll do whatever you want.
[02:16:08.741 --> 02:16:16.126]  Of course, the politicians mostly aren't really strongly imbued with a wish to do anything else.
[02:16:16.606 --> 02:16:17.567]  And they probably are
[02:16:18.351 --> 02:16:28.944]  Somehow going to get rewarded for going along, but when the people go to them and say, we demand you regulate this practice, the politicians have a ready excuse.
[02:16:29.024 --> 02:16:31.127]  They say, well, given this treaty,
[02:16:33.094 --> 02:16:38.557]  The companies will all just move to another country, so it's futile to even try to regulate them.
[02:16:38.697 --> 02:16:45.341]  And then that creates a global standardized corporate law, which has no liberty, no freedom, no due process.
[02:16:45.621 --> 02:16:56.407]  They call that globalism, and then they hire a bunch of phony leftists and right-wingers to go around pushing it and spewing it, and now they're trying to move Internet control into these international bodies.
[02:16:57.048 --> 02:16:58.549]  Do you think the Internet's going to survive?
[02:16:59.529 --> 02:17:00.690]  I can't see the future.
[02:17:01.528 --> 02:17:05.350]  I tend to be somewhat of a pessimist by nature.
[02:17:06.130 --> 02:17:10.513]  It's just that even if I feel discouraged, I keep on fighting.
[02:17:11.173 --> 02:17:23.319]  So, it's not particularly bad that I'm a pessimist, but the point is, if I tried to answer that question, all I could do is tell you my pessimism, which doesn't prove anything.
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:24.500]  That's not the point.
[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:27.402]  The real question is, what can we do to fight this?
[02:17:28.102 --> 02:17:29.863]  We have to demand the abolition
[02:17:30.353 --> 02:17:32.194]  of these so-called free trade treaties.
[02:17:32.214 --> 02:17:36.137]  You see, the arguments for those free trade treaties are narrow-minded.
[02:17:36.677 --> 02:17:40.139]  They say, well, it makes for economic efficiencies.
[02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:41.340]  And it does.
[02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:48.124]  If all you're interested in is flat-out efficiency of production, then, yeah, they work.
[02:17:48.485 --> 02:17:53.748]  But they give all their benefits to rich people, and they corrupt the laws.
[02:17:54.446 --> 02:18:01.954]  Of every country that's participating, and that hurts us far more than the benefits economically we might hope to get.
[02:18:03.095 --> 02:18:05.778]  Alright, final segment with our guest Richard Stallman.
[02:18:06.158 --> 02:18:07.439]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:18:07.459 --> 02:18:07.940]  Stay with us.
[02:18:10.970 --> 02:18:13.293]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[02:18:13.433 --> 02:18:17.137]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[02:18:17.237 --> 02:18:19.900]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[02:18:20.061 --> 02:18:27.249]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[02:18:27.389 --> 02:18:28.009]  We're good to go.
[02:18:43.837 --> 02:18:47.839]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[02:18:47.979 --> 02:18:52.982]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:18:53.802 --> 02:18:58.705]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[02:18:58.845 --> 02:19:02.587]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:19:03.287 --> 02:19:05.789]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[02:19:05.949 --> 02:19:06.389]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:19:11.454 --> 02:19:16.716]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:19:17.504 --> 02:19:22.828]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:19:23.368 --> 02:19:29.572]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:19:29.872 --> 02:19:31.693]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:19:31.853 --> 02:19:34.235]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:19:34.315 --> 02:19:45.182]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:19:47.486 --> 02:19:48.747]  It's not about left or right.
[02:19:49.147 --> 02:19:50.547]  It's about a one world government.
[02:19:51.008 --> 02:19:57.370]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:19:57.910 --> 02:20:05.714]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:20:06.174 --> 02:20:07.334]  The Obama Deception.
[02:20:07.754 --> 02:20:08.935]  The people strike back.
[02:20:11.038 --> 02:20:14.580]  Hi, my name is MZ, owner of KSCO in Santa Cruz, California.
[02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:20.624]  And like Alex Jones, I'm passionate about talk radio, that great bastion of freedom of expression for us all.
[02:20:20.764 --> 02:20:34.573]  I'm also passionate about helping people know the joys, benefits, and surprisingly simple methods of becoming entrepreneurs who work for themselves and not as wage slaves for someone else, or even worse, for large companies with no heart and soul, nor loyalty to their employees.
[02:20:34.833 --> 02:20:54.010]  If you are tired of being dependent on others for a living and ready to start owning yourself, loving your work, and setting the sky as the limit for your earning potential, I want you to know about an exciting great business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that actually helps people lose weight and can help them make money, perhaps lots of it, just by helping us spread the word about this wonderful unique product.
[02:20:54.090 --> 02:20:56.892]  Get on the web and go to www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[02:20:56.952 --> 02:20:59.034]  That's www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[02:20:59.134 --> 02:21:00.335]  And check out our opportunity.
[02:21:00.375 --> 02:21:01.696]  You'll know pretty quick if you're interested.
[02:21:01.756 --> 02:21:04.037]  If you are, we will connect with you and get you up and running.
[02:21:04.097 --> 02:21:07.440]  We don't want any money from you, and you'll be amazed at how simple this system is.
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:09.982]  Remember www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[02:21:15.226 --> 02:21:15.826]  All right, folks.
[02:21:15.866 --> 02:21:17.147]  The show is almost over.
[02:21:17.227 --> 02:21:19.829]  Rebroadcast with reports from Bilderberg 2009.
[02:21:19.869 --> 02:21:23.272]  Kind of a wrap-up of all the latest developments there.
[02:21:25.390 --> 02:21:31.593]  And bills where without arrest, without charge, they just put you on a terror list as a citizen, like the no-fly list, you can't own guns.
[02:21:32.393 --> 02:21:33.374]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[02:21:33.414 --> 02:21:36.135]  Free speech bills where if you hurt somebody's feelings, you're arrested.
[02:21:36.555 --> 02:21:37.536]  Cyberbullying Act.
[02:21:38.016 --> 02:21:39.237]  And of course, it's internet only.
[02:21:39.577 --> 02:21:43.279]  You know, we notice that the media and the establishment have tried to demonize the internet, sir.
[02:21:44.339 --> 02:21:48.540]  And they've tried to, but now they're kind of having to join it, but they still demonize it at the same time.
[02:21:48.981 --> 02:22:05.226]  I'm pessimistic, but I'm also positive that they've tried to control it and demonize it and kind of mutate it before, and that they are getting a lot of what they want in the way of tyranny, but in a way people are just ignoring them, and we're going around them.
[02:22:05.306 --> 02:22:08.067]  Or, final comments on that front, anything positive?
[02:22:08.852 --> 02:22:14.177]  Um, you may be partly right, but you know, I don't keep track of the things that are working well.
[02:22:14.617 --> 02:22:18.560]  I read the news about the threats and the outrages.
[02:22:19.981 --> 02:22:25.026]  So yeah, I keep on using the internet to talk with people about the free software movement.
[02:22:25.566 --> 02:22:35.775]  I continue posting links to articles about various kinds of outrages typically committed by governments and religious fanatics and
[02:22:36.855 --> 02:22:39.105]  So far I haven't been stopped from doing this.
[02:22:39.125 --> 02:22:39.788]  No.
[02:22:40.967 --> 02:22:46.290]  Well, I agree with you that we need to focus on the bad stuff that's happening so that the good can continue to be gotten out.
[02:22:46.330 --> 02:22:47.111]  We just commend you.
[02:22:47.531 --> 02:22:49.652]  How do folks visit the two different organizations?
[02:22:49.712 --> 02:22:50.873]  How do they support what you're doing, sir?
[02:22:51.333 --> 02:22:55.615]  Well, there's GNU.org, which is the site of the GNU system and the Free Software Movement.
[02:22:56.016 --> 02:23:02.519]  There's FFF.org, which is the Free Software Foundation, where they can join and get other resources.
[02:23:02.860 --> 02:23:06.922]  And my personal site is Stallman.org, and that's where I post
[02:23:07.646 --> 02:23:15.489]  Uh, notes about other political issues and anything else I want to post that doesn't fit into those two organizations.
[02:23:15.649 --> 02:23:17.470]  Stahlman.org.
[02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:20.411]  Stahlman is the right place to read your writings and more research.
[02:23:20.431 --> 02:23:28.433]  Well, sir, next time we won't keep you for 50 minutes, but next time you'll come back on as things develop and unfold a few times a year, we'd like to get more reports from you.
[02:23:28.453 --> 02:23:29.694]  So I really appreciate you coming on.
[02:23:32.017 --> 02:23:33.218]  Okay, he is gone then.
[02:23:33.258 --> 02:23:34.279]  He took that as the cue to go.
[02:23:34.519 --> 02:23:40.244]  Let's bring up Ted Anderson because he is there with us at the end of the show here.
[02:23:40.584 --> 02:23:44.247]  Look, I got in my silver rounds, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:44.707 --> 02:23:45.608]  I already had a few of these.
[02:23:45.628 --> 02:23:47.530]  Everybody talks about how these are the prettiest.
[02:23:47.810 --> 02:23:54.092]  If you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv or on the web later at PrisonPlanet.tv, these are the prettiest silver coins I've ever seen.
[02:23:54.452 --> 02:23:55.973]  They're sold out almost everywhere.
[02:23:56.053 --> 02:24:01.315]  Ted has a whole bunch of them, but it's almost sold out at the lower price before silver went up a few weeks ago.
[02:24:01.795 --> 02:24:02.255]  Look at these.
[02:24:02.295 --> 02:24:04.416]  Let's show folks a close shot of those.
[02:24:04.876 --> 02:24:05.936]  That's what I've got them there for.
[02:24:06.836 --> 02:24:11.838]  Look at these one-ounce silver coins, Lakota.
[02:24:11.898 --> 02:24:12.738]  Lakota Nation.
[02:24:13.599 --> 02:24:15.059]  And it is just gorgeous.
[02:24:15.119 --> 02:24:16.900]  It's really shiny, mirror image.
[02:24:18.261 --> 02:24:24.205]  Silver and on the back it
[02:24:26.824 --> 02:24:29.587]  It has a buffalo, as you can see right there.
[02:24:29.607 --> 02:24:31.588]  I mean, just look at this, folks.
[02:24:31.989 --> 02:24:35.692]  It doesn't get more gorgeous than this, and these things are going for $25 everywhere.
[02:24:36.032 --> 02:24:39.716]  Ted Anderson has them for $19, and you are not going to find a deal like that anywhere.
[02:24:39.896 --> 02:24:46.522]  Hey, Ted, I just wanted to bring you up right here at the very end of the show, because I finally have a bunch of these to show people, and you've got these in stock.
[02:24:47.523 --> 02:24:52.087]  Tell folks, because you buy a bunch of them, you pass on that wholesale discount to everybody, don't you, Ted?
[02:24:52.347 --> 02:24:53.027]  Yeah, sure do.
[02:24:53.087 --> 02:24:54.088]  And actually, they're $19.66.
[02:24:54.788 --> 02:24:57.490]  So, I mean, I don't want to make any confusion out there.
[02:24:57.850 --> 02:24:59.491]  But $19.66.
[02:24:59.791 --> 02:25:03.013]  But anyways, yeah, we did buy a whole bunch of them.
[02:25:03.574 --> 02:25:08.977]  And now, with silver where it is right now, they're going to be over the $20 range, even with me.
[02:25:09.037 --> 02:25:10.538]  So if you're interested, call us at 800-686-2237.
[02:25:10.578 --> 02:25:11.838]  It is a gorgeous coin.
[02:25:11.858 --> 02:25:13.119]  There's no question about it, Alex.
[02:25:17.012 --> 02:25:17.352]  Absolutely.
[02:25:17.372 --> 02:25:19.073]  In fact, guys, show them this stack over here again.
[02:25:19.093 --> 02:25:20.474]  I've never seen a silver coin like this.
[02:25:20.494 --> 02:25:25.796]  In fact, as good as they look on camera, you just really can't do justice to these bad boys.
[02:25:26.697 --> 02:25:32.820]  Ted Anderson, 800-686-2237.
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:33.160]  800-686-2237.
[02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:37.682]  Brokers will be there until midnight tonight to take advantage of that very low price while it lasts.
[02:25:37.922 --> 02:25:38.482]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:25:38.862 --> 02:25:39.763]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:25:40.143 --> 02:25:40.463]  You bet.
[02:25:40.563 --> 02:25:40.824]  Okay.
[02:25:40.864 --> 02:25:43.046]  Retransmission starts now on the web at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:43.086 --> 02:25:46.489]  Don't forget the free podcast on the listen page at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:46.749 --> 02:25:47.330]  Spread the word.
[02:25:47.350 --> 02:25:49.732]  That's how we get the information out about Liberty.
[02:25:49.972 --> 02:25:50.333]  Take care.
[02:25:50.393 --> 02:25:51.113]  Great job, crew.
[02:25:52.995 --> 02:25:54.557]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:26:00.979 --> 02:26:09.363]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[02:26:09.624 --> 02:26:14.026]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[02:26:14.466 --> 02:26:19.649]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.
