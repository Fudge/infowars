[00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:09.640]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.220]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.781]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:16.983]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:21.044]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:33.989]  Remember Charlie Skelton from the London Guardian?
[00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.452]  He got into a physical fracas that basically assaulted him while he was covering Bilderberg.
[00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:43.113]  Then he tried to get away from Bilderberg.
[00:00:43.113 --> 00:00:46.274]  They were following him everywhere, going in his hotel room.
[00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:47.935]  The list goes on and on.
[00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:51.396]  He is boarding a plane in a horrified fashion to get back to England.
[00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:55.157]  He will be on with us for a full debriefing on Bilderberg 2009.
[00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:08.094]  Tomorrow, Paul Dornanoo, who shot a lot of the footage you see from Istanbul, he's Romanian, he shot a lot of the footage you see in in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:19.564]  That is some of the footage shot where they're being followed by secret police and being harassed by men with machine guns in Istanbul in Bilderberg 2007 that Governor Rick Perry and others were attending traitorously.
[00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:23.378]  So we will have updates on that.
[00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:27.319]  Paul Dornanew joining us in one hour and 30 minutes today.
[00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:34.140]  Coming up in the next segment, we've got Chuck Baldwin joining us and it couldn't be better timing.
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.042]  Then in the last hour we're going to cover growing internet censorship and kind of chronicle some of that.
[00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:41.142]  So that is all coming up.
[00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:44.702]  But it's a good thing that Chuck Baldwin is coming up.
[00:01:44.702 --> 00:01:46.783]  This is perfect timing that I had him set up.
[00:01:47.839 --> 00:02:06.873]  Because of his article last week, he wrote, it is getting very serious now at ChuckBaldwin.com, where he breaks down not just the MIAC report and the DHS report saying veterans and gun owners are the main threat that Homeland Security is set up to deal with the American people, but that a new bill has been introduced
[00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:22.556]  Saying that extremists will be put on a no-gun list, and there will be no arrest, no indictment, you'll have no way to know why you're on the list, just no more Second Amendment at the will of the President, the Justice Department, or any of their designates.
[00:02:22.556 --> 00:02:26.317]  This is the complete end of freedom.
[00:02:26.317 --> 00:02:34.260]  I mean, even in Russia and Communist China at their worst, they will make up reasons you're being held, or make up reasons you're having your rights taken.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.901]  This is Kafka-esque.
[00:02:36.937 --> 00:02:45.382]  You know, a famous novel where the guy gets arrested and gets tried and gets executed, never knowing what his crime was.
[00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:47.704]  I mean, this is the heart.
[00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:50.525]  There's a center of a black hole of tyranny.
[00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:57.750]  It is secretly having your rights stripped, secretly being arrested, secret detention, which the White House is saying they're going to continue and for U.S.
[00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.190]  citizens.
[00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.352]  So, that's what the Military Commissions Act states.
[00:03:01.352 --> 00:03:04.794]  They just strip you of your citizenship in an extrajudicial system.
[00:03:06.092 --> 00:03:13.735]  Now, as bad as that is, we learned with absolute horror yesterday, Kurt Nemo discovered it, and I have to say, we broke it.
[00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.576]  I don't know why we continue to discover stuff.
[00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:25.841]  Actually, listeners emailed us the legislation, and when I saw this last night when I got home from the radio show, I was staggered by it.
[00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:33.184]  I was staggered by the legislation, by the over-the-top, in-your-face,
[00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.871]  Strength of it.
[00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:41.092]  Just the fact that it was so open.
[00:03:41.092 --> 00:03:51.115]  And that is, ladies and gentlemen, drumroll please, Curt Nemo, InfoWars.com, direct link to the bill.
[00:03:51.115 --> 00:03:56.077]  Bill in Congress would ban gun ownership at will.
[00:03:56.077 --> 00:04:00.338]  This is a completely separate bill.
[00:04:00.338 --> 00:04:01.618]  There's now three of these.
[00:04:01.618 --> 00:04:02.759]  There's one that's the
[00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:16.132]  article he wrote about a week ago uh... this uh... terrorist extremist list and this new bill H.R.
[00:04:16.132 --> 00:04:32.937]  2159 denying firearms and explosives the dangerous terrorist act two thousand nine sounds reasonable oh it's a convicted terrorist I'll let him have my gun no no this is anybody on the one point one million over a million people and growing on that list well the new bill
[00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:37.252]  Says the same thing.
[00:04:37.252 --> 00:04:43.034]  And then there's that other bill they've got introduced where the Attorney General can ban guns at will.
[00:04:43.034 --> 00:04:47.076]  It's like, oh, we passed a law saying the Attorney General's God.
[00:04:47.076 --> 00:04:49.037]  You can't do that.
[00:04:49.037 --> 00:04:56.720]  And we passed a bill saying Madoff can kidnap little children and barbecue them on a spit if he wants, and he can't do that.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.041]  And we passed a law that everybody has to worship Hitler, you can't do that.
[00:05:00.618 --> 00:05:09.268]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:14.113]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:19.299]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:06.569]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:13.238]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:19.740]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.701]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.701 --> 00:06:24.161]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.161 --> 00:06:35.045]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.347 --> 00:06:39.008]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.008 --> 00:06:40.869]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:47.794]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:56.059]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:57.620]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.801]  The people strike back.
[00:07:01.124 --> 00:07:10.187]  Hello, eFoodsDirect wants everyone to have food that tastes better than home cooking, but we have found some more people that we don't want to have our food.
[00:07:10.187 --> 00:07:18.969]  If you think pornography is protected free speech, but speaking to God in public prayer should be prohibited, don't visit eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:27.772]  If you think that automakers who create millions of jobs should be put out of business, but modern day money changers who create nothing should be bailed out, don't
[00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:32.191]  We're good to go.
[00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:10.203]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.203 --> 00:08:11.783]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.344]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.344 --> 00:08:17.545]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.545 --> 00:08:23.086]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:29.987]  There is not one, there is not two, there is three bills I know of.
[00:08:29.987 --> 00:08:33.528]  And there are tens of thousands of pieces of legislation getting introduced every session.
[00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.576]  Bills introduced by powerful members of the Democratic Party.
[00:08:39.576 --> 00:08:49.529]  Bills previously introduced by the White House Chief of Staff when he was the Congressman from Illinois, Rahm Emanuel.
[00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.091]  He has written a book about it.
[00:08:51.091 --> 00:08:52.392]  He has given speeches about it.
[00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.496]  Barack Obama has given speeches and voted for total gun bans in Illinois.
[00:08:57.496 --> 00:08:59.979]  No guns, total ban.
[00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:03.845]  The Attorney General put in briefings last year in the D.C.
[00:09:03.845 --> 00:09:08.932]  gun ban case and he believed no citizen should be allowed to own any gun anywhere in the United States.
[00:09:09.713 --> 00:09:14.937]  And then you have record gun sales and the media runs news pieces every day that I see.
[00:09:14.937 --> 00:09:17.139]  And I'm not watching television.
[00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:25.086]  I'll be on MSNBC and this morning looking at financial news and see a video clip in the corner, you know, making fun of gun owners buying guns.
[00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:28.188]  And I clicked on it and there, I mean, it's everywhere!
[00:09:28.188 --> 00:09:29.830]  Oh, look at these crazy people!
[00:09:30.762 --> 00:09:48.540]  You know, they think the government's coming after their guns when this is the biggest group of anti-Second Amendment, anti-self-defense, anti-American trash I have ever seen in my life, and the media is engaged in a massive hoax cover-up saying it doesn't exist.
[00:09:50.859 --> 00:09:53.880]  Meanwhile, it's gotta be more than 15 senators.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:00.922]  I mean, every couple days I see a different senator in the news saying, yeah, we need a new fairness doctor, not just for radio and TV, but for the internet.
[00:10:00.922 --> 00:10:04.963]  And they've got the Cyber Bullying Act, separate from the Hate Crimes Bill.
[00:10:04.963 --> 00:10:07.143]  The Hate Crimes Bill is a distraction.
[00:10:07.143 --> 00:10:10.424]  Because that restricts the First Amendment somewhat.
[00:10:10.424 --> 00:10:12.185]  I mean, this Cyber Bullying says
[00:10:13.737 --> 00:10:15.819]  I've given the bill number out the last two weeks fifty times.
[00:10:15.819 --> 00:10:16.419]  I'll give it out again.
[00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:19.162]  In fact, guys, I already cleaned off my desk from last week.
[00:10:19.162 --> 00:10:21.203]  Will somebody print me the Cyberbullying Act again?
[00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:30.371]  It actually says in there, if someone signs an affidavit saying what you wrote or said hurts their feelings, you are indicted federally under a felony.
[00:10:30.371 --> 00:10:33.333]  Of course, that'll all be selectively enforced.
[00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:37.177]  And you've got in states all over the country, Missouri, Illinois,
[00:10:38.675 --> 00:10:41.496]  Michigan, Vermont, of all places.
[00:10:41.496 --> 00:10:51.119]  Police on the news saying if you criticize Obama, we're going to arrest you.
[00:10:51.119 --> 00:10:52.880]  We have mainstream newscasts.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.680]  We play here all the time.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.381]  I'm not going to play it again.
[00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:55.581]  If you don't believe me, fine.
[00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:57.542]  Suck your thumb and just think it's made up.
[00:10:57.542 --> 00:11:03.084]  The point is, sit there in a straight jacket, sucking your thumb in a mental institution.
[00:11:03.084 --> 00:11:06.485]  We live in reality here, and those of you telling us
[00:11:07.597 --> 00:11:09.898]  That we're crazy?
[00:11:09.898 --> 00:11:16.542]  I keep getting emails every day and I see it all over YouTube and Google when I just happen to be surfing for videos and news and clips.
[00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:22.545]  I'm being attacked saying I'm a liar, the Obama deception is a lie, Obama doesn't want our guns.
[00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:25.226]  What planet are you people from?
[00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:45.737]  You know, it's like when we say we don't want the North American Union, and it's all over Canadian, British, the President Bush has press conferences admitting we're under the North American Union, and then news articles get written about myself and Lou Dobbs and others making fun of us, saying it doesn't exist.
[00:11:45.737 --> 00:11:53.980]  You know, they would tell people that for 40 years in Europe, that the Euro didn't exist, and now it's all declassified in public that they set it up in 1957.
[00:11:57.913 --> 00:11:59.954]  And there is a European Union.
[00:11:59.954 --> 00:12:03.456]  And by the way, when I say that, listeners, I'm not joking for informed people.
[00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:06.817]  There are actual folks out there that say the EU doesn't exist.
[00:12:06.817 --> 00:12:11.480]  This is the level of denial that they are living in.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:18.503]  And so they've introduced a new bill.
[00:12:18.503 --> 00:12:19.884]  Another bill to restrict free speech.
[00:12:19.884 --> 00:12:20.704]  We're going to get to that later.
[00:12:23.379 --> 00:12:38.167]  I did some research this weekend on the Michael Savage situation on NPR and a bunch of other mainline radio, and they're on there and in news articles defending Michael Savage's band from traveling to Europe for criticizing open borders.
[00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:39.748]  And by the way, it's not just England.
[00:12:39.748 --> 00:12:44.231]  That's a EU regulation that the Home Secretary, Jackie Smith, is following.
[00:12:45.325 --> 00:13:01.389]  And I sat there last night with my wife at like midnight, she couldn't believe it, watching, I say watching because it's all up on YouTube, audio put to video of radio show after radio show, National NPR, you name it, saying yes, ban his free speech, it's good.
[00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:11.152]  And then I heard Savage on National NPR with them defending him losing his free speech, and then Savage just hung up on him.
[00:13:11.152 --> 00:13:11.572]  The interview.
[00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:15.516]  And again, I don't like Michael Savage in many respects.
[00:13:15.516 --> 00:13:20.782]  On a lot of things, he's just riddling and Prozac's, making the kids go psychopathic and kill people.
[00:13:20.782 --> 00:13:23.966]  You know, I mean, on about 80% of things, it's carbon copy.
[00:13:25.267 --> 00:13:27.428]  And I can't say he copied me or I copied him.
[00:13:27.428 --> 00:13:33.250]  He's been on the air syndicated for 10 years and so have I. We've both been on the air 14 years.
[00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.051]  So the issue is we're on the same page on so many issues.
[00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:42.033]  But I don't think leftists should be put in forced labor camps if they disagree with war.
[00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:45.174]  And I criticized him then when he said that.
[00:13:45.174 --> 00:13:48.455]  But now they're saying don't let him have free speech.
[00:13:48.455 --> 00:13:49.675]  I'm criticizing them.
[00:13:49.675 --> 00:13:50.996]  But to see the left
[00:13:51.897 --> 00:14:03.421]  In this country, openly, the majority of them saying, get rid of free speech, and these are high-powered Democrats introducing the Cyberbullying Act.
[00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:09.322]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, in fact, we need a drumroll for this.
[00:14:09.322 --> 00:14:12.544]  Drumroll, please.
[00:14:12.544 --> 00:14:13.904]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:23.123 --> 00:14:29.645]  I mean, I've got to point out that this is serious, and not just throw it out there.
[00:14:29.645 --> 00:14:36.906]  Bill in Congress would ban gun ownership at will, InfoWars.com, Curt Nemo.
[00:14:36.906 --> 00:14:46.369]  Ladies and gentlemen, May 13th, that's right, it took us two, three days to find out about this, thanks to listeners sent it to Curt Nemo at InfoWars.com, so we got it out.
[00:14:46.369 --> 00:14:50.270]  Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced the No Fly, No Buy Act, H.R. 2401.
[00:14:52.378 --> 00:14:59.720]  A bill that would merge the TSA's no-fly list with the National Instant Criminal Background Check at point-of-sale system, determining eligibility.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:07.502]  Now remember, you're not arrested, you're not indicted, you don't know where this came from, and then now they're saying a no-buy list, a no-sell list, a no-travel list.
[00:15:07.502 --> 00:15:09.262]  This is the global system.
[00:15:09.262 --> 00:15:10.962]  This is what Europe already has.
[00:15:10.962 --> 00:15:16.664]  This thing with Michael Savage, or myself being arrested, or David Icke being arrested when we go to Canada.
[00:15:17.264 --> 00:15:21.666]  You know, this whole thing of peace activists not being able to get on planes.
[00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:25.168]  You know, you've heard about Green Party people not being able to fly.
[00:15:25.168 --> 00:15:27.650]  All of this is the global model.
[00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.591]  And everybody keeps talking about the global currency.
[00:15:29.591 --> 00:15:30.551]  What will it look like?
[00:15:30.551 --> 00:15:32.393]  It's going to be your thumbprint and your face print.
[00:15:32.393 --> 00:15:34.174]  The UN, it's all under treaty.
[00:15:34.174 --> 00:15:36.055]  That's why they're phasing out cash.
[00:15:36.055 --> 00:15:43.739]  That's how they'll go to the new world currency instantly when they want to because that's why your kids are thumb scanning to get their school lunches.
[00:15:43.739 --> 00:15:45.060]  All of this ties together.
[00:15:45.936 --> 00:15:48.557]  This is the secret list!
[00:15:48.557 --> 00:15:52.137]  And your ID card says you're out of favor, you don't travel, you don't get a job.
[00:15:52.137 --> 00:15:55.718]  It's all under Patriot Act compliance.
[00:15:55.718 --> 00:16:09.381]  So, we've got the bill that we wrote about at Infowars.com a week and a half ago, that Chuck Baldwin wrote about last week in his article, it's getting serious now, that gave a nice boil down of a bigger picture.
[00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:11.041]  And they've introduced H.R.
[00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:13.802]  2159, denying firearms and explosives to terrorists.
[00:16:16.499 --> 00:16:18.201]  Dangerous terrorist act.
[00:16:18.201 --> 00:16:19.142]  And it says the same thing.
[00:16:19.142 --> 00:16:24.847]  We'll secretly put anybody and everybody in intelligence files by the tens of millions.
[00:16:24.847 --> 00:16:27.209]  And you're not going to have, it's already happening.
[00:16:27.209 --> 00:16:35.417]  Veterans and others, we already told you ten years ago that veterans were being barred from buying firearms with not even a misdemeanor conviction.
[00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:36.759]  It's happening!
[00:16:38.066 --> 00:16:38.987]  This isn't a game.
[00:16:38.987 --> 00:16:47.915]  And then on top of that, they've now released footage of the AmeriCorps chanting and marching in red uniforms trimmed with black.
[00:16:47.915 --> 00:16:49.717]  It is so fascist.
[00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:51.378]  It's so over the top.
[00:16:51.378 --> 00:16:53.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, everything is off the charts.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:17:00.126]  Let's go to presidential candidate 2008, Chuck Baldwin, pastor, author, researcher, talk show host.
[00:17:00.126 --> 00:17:03.069]  Chuck Baldwin, things are getting wild.
[00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:05.491]  You're right when you say it's getting very serious now.
[00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.300]  Absolutely, and thank you very much, Alex, for letting me come on your show.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:23.367]  When I wrote that, I felt that I had to get the message out to the people that are reading my columns to help them understand, as you have been trying to do for all these years, on how things really are getting serious out there, hence the title of my column.
[00:17:23.367 --> 00:17:28.110]  And I pointed out some of the very things that you just mentioned here at the opening of your program.
[00:17:30.143 --> 00:17:31.284]  Start breaking it down.
[00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:36.768]  I mean, you know, there's three bills that will allow them without an indictment, without arrest.
[00:17:36.768 --> 00:17:38.650]  I mean, that's the heart of tyranny.
[00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:46.876]  Three bills to just allow bureaucrats at will, secretly, to take your rights, and you can't find out how you got on there or even challenge it.
[00:17:46.876 --> 00:17:47.657]  Right.
[00:17:47.657 --> 00:17:53.741]  Well, the bill that I specifically mentioned in my column was Peter King's bill, H.R.
[00:17:53.741 --> 00:17:57.244]  2159, the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2009.
[00:17:58.823 --> 00:18:13.233]  Which basically permits the Attorney General, on his signature, to deny transfer of a firearm to anyone that he deems to be, quote, a dangerous terrorist, close quote.
[00:18:13.233 --> 00:18:19.997]  This is someone that is identified solely on the basis of his opinion.
[00:18:19.997 --> 00:18:21.498]  There's no arrest.
[00:18:21.498 --> 00:18:27.482]  There is no act that the person has committed.
[00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:28.463]  There's no charge.
[00:18:29.356 --> 00:18:31.978]  Uh, no sentence, no trial, no anything.
[00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:38.321]  It's just that the Attorney General says, I believe this person is a dangerous terrorist, therefore they are not able to buy a firearm.
[00:18:38.321 --> 00:18:41.542]  Or his designates, this is divine right of kings.
[00:18:41.542 --> 00:18:41.763]  Correct.
[00:18:41.763 --> 00:18:42.423]  That's correct.
[00:18:42.423 --> 00:18:43.303]  Or his designates.
[00:18:43.303 --> 00:18:44.584]  Exactly right.
[00:18:44.584 --> 00:18:47.345]  Uh, so this is, as you say, fascism.
[00:18:47.345 --> 00:18:53.048]  I mean, you know, people don't like to use that word, but the fact of the matter is, this is exactly the definition.
[00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:58.011]  Whenever you can arbitrarily, without warrant, without cause,
[00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:04.238]  ...can deny basic rights to the citizenry.
[00:19:04.238 --> 00:19:11.461]  You have crossed the Rubicon and now that you are in a country that is fascist in nature.
[00:19:12.938 --> 00:19:17.781]  It's unbelievable, you know, we all have a blind spot, Pastor Baldwin, but I have one too.
[00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:26.465]  I mean, I consciously, intellectually look at this, and then it hits me emotionally, and I'm not even having the response I should.
[00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.686]  We've been so marinated in tyranny.
[00:19:28.686 --> 00:19:31.868]  This is all off the charts.
[00:19:31.868 --> 00:19:33.809]  Absolutely off the charts.
[00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:37.211]  And it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out.
[00:19:37.211 --> 00:19:39.732]  There are people that are beginning to wake up, fortunately.
[00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:46.638]  Two things that are happening in this regard, and I just pray that more people awaken quickly.
[00:19:46.638 --> 00:19:47.759]  Pastor Baldwin, stay with us.
[00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:53.085]  We'll come back and talk about your website and what you're doing in the Constitution Party these days and where all this goes.
[00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:56.469]  And boy, I wish we had Ron Paul, don't you folks?
[00:19:56.469 --> 00:19:59.333]  As president, but instead we've got a total piece of trash.
[00:20:00.911 --> 00:20:02.892]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:20:02.892 --> 00:20:08.235]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:20:08.235 --> 00:20:09.856]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:20:09.856 --> 00:20:18.261]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:20:18.261 --> 00:20:23.964]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:20:24.144 --> 00:20:25.985]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:20:25.985 --> 00:20:28.186]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:32.709]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:20:32.709 --> 00:20:34.930]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:42.775]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:48.618]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.188 --> 00:21:15.314]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.314 --> 00:21:23.480]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.584]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:28.584 --> 00:21:33.207]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:33.775 --> 00:21:37.677]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[00:21:37.677 --> 00:21:39.217]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.217 --> 00:21:43.719]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:48.622]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:48.622 --> 00:21:51.623]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:51.623 --> 00:21:53.404]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.404 --> 00:21:53.644]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.644 --> 00:21:55.244]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:22:03.706 --> 00:22:06.331]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.331 --> 00:22:13.325]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:20.424]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.424 --> 00:22:22.485]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.485 --> 00:22:24.966]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:24.966 --> 00:22:36.553]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:36.553 --> 00:22:38.234]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.234 --> 00:22:39.595]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.074 --> 00:22:46.976]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:46.976 --> 00:22:55.238]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.238 --> 00:22:56.819]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:56.819 --> 00:22:57.999]  The people strike back.
[00:23:00.034 --> 00:23:07.157]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:23:07.157 --> 00:23:22.283]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all
[00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:23.363]  In the dark.
[00:23:23.363 --> 00:23:28.726]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:23:28.726 --> 00:23:35.249]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:23:35.249 --> 00:23:39.131]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:41.832]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[00:23:41.832 --> 00:23:47.195]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:23:47.495 --> 00:23:50.177]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:23:50.177 --> 00:23:52.399]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:23:52.399 --> 00:23:54.901]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:23:54.901 --> 00:23:59.185]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[00:24:04.795 --> 00:24:06.656]  I gotta be honest with the audience.
[00:24:06.656 --> 00:24:11.698]  Things are moving faster and are worse than I even thought they could get this quickly.
[00:24:11.698 --> 00:24:22.903]  I mean, we know the globalists are tyrannical, but to see in the United States, bills introduced to charge you with felonies federally, if you quote, hurt someone's feelings?
[00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:27.900]  And to see it being introduced by prominent members of the House and racing?
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.121]  To see three bills introduced where they can secretly ban your Second Amendment?
[00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:45.604]  And you know, Chuck Baldwin last week interpreted this bill and said, you know, they could use the no-fly list, they could use the MIAC report list, they could use these other lists to... And then now, now with the new bill, it confirms our worst fears.
[00:24:45.604 --> 00:24:46.424]  They say yes!
[00:24:47.446 --> 00:24:49.107]  Yes in H.R.
[00:24:49.107 --> 00:24:49.407]  2401.
[00:24:49.407 --> 00:24:55.131]  If you're on any list or any database or anything, or on the no-fly list, no Second Amendment.
[00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:59.434]  Pastor Baldwin, you know, people accuse us sometimes of being fearmongers.
[00:24:59.434 --> 00:25:01.235]  No, no, we need people to raise the alarm.
[00:25:01.235 --> 00:25:06.879]  We need people to stand up and warn the public, or this is all going to make it.
[00:25:06.879 --> 00:25:14.644]  And then I just can't believe we're having kind of like an amalgamation of a Soviet slash Nazi takeover.
[00:25:14.644 --> 00:25:16.626]  I mean, does it ever just stun you that this is happening?
[00:25:18.132 --> 00:25:22.735]  Alex, I agree with your assessment that it's happening faster than we expected.
[00:25:22.735 --> 00:25:32.542]  I can tell you, in fact, people that are listening right now that know me and have listened to me in my comments over the last few weeks, I've said the exact same thing as you just said.
[00:25:32.542 --> 00:25:43.570]  You know, we anticipated some of these things to be happening over the next several months and maybe even a couple of years, but we've seen things escalate at such a rate
[00:25:44.699 --> 00:25:48.680]  Over these last few weeks, that it's really difficult to keep up with it all.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:59.123]  I mean, I know that you are pouring over all this information as you see coming in every day, three hours a day, and it's hard for you to keep up with it, as you just said, and I find the same thing to be true.
[00:25:59.123 --> 00:26:08.706]  It's happening at such a fast rate that it really is hard to get a handle on it, and I think that
[00:26:09.605 --> 00:26:23.088]  That the American people, the ones that are beginning to wake up, the ones that are beginning to sense that things are going in the wrong direction, I believe it's kind of taking them back as well, how quickly this is happening.
[00:26:23.088 --> 00:26:35.650]  Now, the positive thing about it is, Alex, I do think because of your show and many other people that are out there trying to sound the alarm, what they call spammers or not, so be it, they probably said that about the committees of correspondence back in the 1700s.
[00:26:37.691 --> 00:26:41.993]  This is reality, and people are beginning to awaken to reality.
[00:26:41.993 --> 00:26:43.194]  That's the positive thing.
[00:26:43.194 --> 00:26:48.477]  And I think that the line is being drawn in the sand right now.
[00:26:48.477 --> 00:26:52.859]  And I think that people are going to have to decide, you know, what side of that line they're on.
[00:26:52.859 --> 00:27:06.066]  Either they believe in the Constitution, they believe in the rule of law, they believe in the fundamental principles of the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, they believe on those principles that America was founded, or they are going to willingly
[00:27:06.736 --> 00:27:22.846]  of their own volition surrender to this new world order mindset and I do believe that line is being drawn in the sand and I would just like to encourage your audience out there to keep abreast of this and to recognize that what is happening is happening quickly
[00:27:23.604 --> 00:27:26.185]  And we need to be prepared for what is yet to come.
[00:27:26.185 --> 00:27:37.128]  And make no mistake, this is history, and just as the enemy is moving quickly, the awakening is also accelerating, and that also takes me back.
[00:27:37.128 --> 00:27:48.232]  I mean, it's exciting, but when you study sociology and history and human activity, it's a very explosive situation, and you know, I'm not some hotshot, you're not a hotshot,
[00:27:49.213 --> 00:27:58.103]  Uh, you know, we're not looking for physical conflict, but unfortunately I see in the cards of the tea leaves, as they say, that this is going towards a collision course.
[00:27:58.103 --> 00:28:04.050]  Uh, so the, I mean, there's no doubt we've never seen an acceleration of, of tyranny anywhere near this.
[00:28:04.771 --> 00:28:07.672]  And it's clear the establishment has decided to jump.
[00:28:07.672 --> 00:28:09.032]  They've decided to go.
[00:28:09.032 --> 00:28:10.313]  Total commitment.
[00:28:10.313 --> 00:28:12.974]  And I just hope the patriots out there know this is it.
[00:28:12.974 --> 00:28:14.534]  This is everything foretold.
[00:28:14.534 --> 00:28:17.655]  Everything we've been building for, you know, against the enemy.
[00:28:17.655 --> 00:28:19.496]  Everything they've been building against us.
[00:28:19.496 --> 00:28:20.536]  All of our preparations.
[00:28:20.536 --> 00:28:21.276]  All of our warnings.
[00:28:21.276 --> 00:28:25.838]  It's clear we are entering, I believe, the battle zone.
[00:28:25.838 --> 00:28:26.818]  Chuck Baldwin?
[00:28:26.818 --> 00:28:27.939]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:32.420]  And I think the battle zone right now is with some of these states
[00:28:33.168 --> 00:28:38.010]  Legislatures that are beginning to take a stand in their respective states.
[00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:47.412]  I think we have, what is it now, between 25 and 30, you probably got a closer number on that, of the states around the nation that have either passed or have pending legislation.
[00:28:47.412 --> 00:28:48.333]  That's 32.
[00:28:48.333 --> 00:28:49.633]  Three states have passed it.
[00:28:49.633 --> 00:28:51.934]  A bunch of governors are trying to block it, yeah.
[00:28:51.934 --> 00:28:52.994]  Right.
[00:28:52.994 --> 00:28:56.575]  That are taking a stand for state sovereignty.
[00:28:56.575 --> 00:28:57.955]  That truly is exciting.
[00:28:57.955 --> 00:29:00.056]  I mean, whether or not all of these states
[00:29:00.618 --> 00:29:08.342]  Truly understand, all the legislators truly understand what's at stake here, or whether or not they actually passed because of a governor's veto or whatever.
[00:29:08.342 --> 00:29:23.071]  All that notwithstanding, it's still exciting in the sense that we have over, now over half, well over half, of the state legislatures around the country that are at least awakened to the point that they recognize their 10th Amendment prerogatives.
[00:29:23.698 --> 00:29:31.125]  And that they, as an independent, autonomous, free state, have an obligation to stand and protect freedom in their states.
[00:29:31.125 --> 00:29:32.946]  That is truly exciting.
[00:29:32.946 --> 00:29:35.569]  Dr. Baldwin, stay with us for five more minutes on the other side.
[00:29:35.569 --> 00:29:42.515]  I want to get your ideas on how we fight the anti-free speech legislation, the anti-Second Amendment legislation, and a lot more.
[00:29:42.515 --> 00:29:45.978]  The website's ChuckBaldwinLive.com, ConstitutionParty.com.
[00:29:45.978 --> 00:29:49.481]  We'll be right back with the 2008 presidential candidate, Chuck Baldwin.
[00:29:50.925 --> 00:29:53.926]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.926 --> 00:30:00.590]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.271]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.271 --> 00:30:07.033]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[00:30:07.033 --> 00:30:09.514]  We need to be independent and food and water is the
[00:30:13.575 --> 00:30:13.775]  We're good.
[00:30:32.265 --> 00:30:32.865]  We're good to go.
[00:31:01.539 --> 00:31:06.798]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.569 --> 00:31:13.453]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.453 --> 00:31:19.957]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.957 --> 00:31:21.938]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.938 --> 00:31:24.400]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:35.267]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.572 --> 00:31:39.233]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.233 --> 00:31:41.094]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:41.094 --> 00:31:48.017]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:57.842]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.842 --> 00:31:59.043]  The people strike back.
[00:32:01.301 --> 00:32:06.804]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:32:06.804 --> 00:32:07.605]  and the world.
[00:32:07.605 --> 00:32:11.467]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:32:11.467 --> 00:32:17.971]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:32:17.971 --> 00:32:19.992]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:32:19.992 --> 00:32:27.937]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:32:28.157 --> 00:32:28.537]  I think so.

[00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:47.891]  Factory direct.

[00:32:49.372 --> 00:32:50.152]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:32:50.152 --> 00:32:51.492]  Well the union's a big business, man.
[00:32:51.492 --> 00:32:52.652]  And it's going down like a dinosaur.
[00:33:11.545 --> 00:33:16.608]  We're going to have Chuck Baldwin with us until noon.
[00:33:38.985 --> 00:33:48.185]  Appreciate it taking time out to join us and I want to open the phones up but specifically on the Hate Crimes Act which gets all the attention that just makes
[00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:57.044]  Thought crimes associated with real crime, physical crime, kick in, so it's a big problem setting that precedent.
[00:33:57.044 --> 00:33:58.945]  That's nothing compared to the Cyber Bullying Act.
[00:33:58.945 --> 00:34:02.547]  It says you don't have to punch somebody, yell at them, nothing.
[00:34:02.547 --> 00:34:09.350]  You write or say something that somebody says hurts their feelings, they sign an affidavit, you are federally charged, period.
[00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.391]  Of course, they'll selectively enforce that.
[00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:14.053]  That's the Cyber Bullying Act.
[00:34:14.053 --> 00:34:17.494]  We've also got all these other bills.
[00:34:17.494 --> 00:34:17.734]  H.R. 2401.
[00:34:20.947 --> 00:34:28.033]  Which puts you on a no-fly list if you're in any of these databases or the government feels like putting you in there.
[00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:30.054]  This is absolutely amazing.
[00:34:30.054 --> 00:34:33.758]  Bill and Congress would ban gun ownership at will.
[00:34:33.758 --> 00:34:37.320]  It's the No-Fly, No-Buy Act, H.R.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:37.340]  2401.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.283]  And this is just the beginning.
[00:34:40.283 --> 00:34:47.849]  The UN, the World Health Organization, admits they're going to use the threat of pandemics to bring in global government.
[00:34:47.849 --> 00:34:49.591]  That came out of Bilderberg this weekend.
[00:34:50.831 --> 00:34:54.633]  They're going to use global financial crises to bring in their new world order.
[00:34:54.633 --> 00:34:57.095]  That's now being set up in front of everybody.
[00:34:57.095 --> 00:35:02.778]  They are going to use global treaties, which Obama is trying to get the Senate to ratify to restrict the Second Amendment.
[00:35:02.778 --> 00:35:07.361]  Heavily banning, altering your firearms, reloading is now an act of terrorism.
[00:35:07.361 --> 00:35:08.462]  It actually says it.
[00:35:08.462 --> 00:35:13.585]  But this one, this ties in with Michael Savage not being allowed to go to England or Europe.
[00:35:13.585 --> 00:35:15.046]  That's an EU rule.
[00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:17.127]  Or the fact that I can't really go to Canada.
[00:35:17.127 --> 00:35:18.468]  I get arrested whenever I go there.
[00:35:19.545 --> 00:35:22.607]  No charges, no reason, they just say you're an extremist.
[00:35:22.607 --> 00:35:27.291]  This is the global system, and boy, isn't that Pastor Baldwin right out of Revelation?
[00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:37.017]  I mean, even if people don't believe in the Christian faith or don't believe in God, shouldn't they be opposed to a global tracking system where you face scan and thumb print to buy and sell?
[00:35:37.017 --> 00:35:43.982]  Because that is what's being set up, and these no-fly lists for gun owners, that's just the beginning.
[00:35:43.982 --> 00:35:46.604]  Oh, you're starting to hit one of my hot buttons now, Alex.
[00:35:48.015 --> 00:36:01.221]  You know, absolutely any Christian, regardless of their eschatology and where they come down on the return of Christ, and of course there's many, many varied opinions on that, depending upon what point of view a particular believer has.
[00:36:01.221 --> 00:36:12.827]  But the point is, there is no doubt that believers throughout history have understood the basic elements of what is called the Mark of the Beast, or the revival of an empire, call it whatever you want.
[00:36:13.853 --> 00:36:24.436]  The Christians throughout history have understood the elements of that, they've understood the evil of it all, and the way that Christians are set in opposition to it.
[00:36:24.436 --> 00:36:42.362]  Unfortunately, what's happened over the last few years is that many of our Christian brothers and sisters have used the return of Christ and the various elements of that doctrine as an excuse to
[00:36:43.837 --> 00:36:53.525]  They literally sit on their blessed assurance and do nothing, saying, well, this is all a part of prophecy and Jesus is coming soon and there's nothing I can do about it.
[00:36:53.525 --> 00:36:57.408]  And just the opposite of what our Lord told us to do.
[00:36:57.408 --> 00:37:03.032]  You know, He told us that as believers we are to occupy until He comes.
[00:37:03.032 --> 00:37:05.694]  Occupation is a very hard, hard work.
[00:37:05.694 --> 00:37:07.936]  It's, you know, it's a very onerous task.
[00:37:07.936 --> 00:37:09.397]  It's a very serious endeavor.
[00:37:10.143 --> 00:37:17.348]  And we have an obligation to oppose these things and to do what is right regardless of when Christ comes.
[00:37:17.348 --> 00:37:21.230]  And it could be today or it could be a hundred years from today or longer.
[00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:24.032]  Pastor, I mean to interrupt, let's look at the word occupy.
[00:37:24.032 --> 00:37:31.757]  The God of this world is the old devil and so occupying, you know, makes the statement, it's like an occupying army.
[00:37:31.757 --> 00:37:34.639]  It means the world will be against us but we've got to occupy it.
[00:37:34.639 --> 00:37:35.420]  That means run it.
[00:37:36.693 --> 00:37:40.114]  Well, occupation is both a military term and a business term.
[00:37:40.114 --> 00:37:43.396]  In the Greek, it literally means to take care of business.
[00:37:43.396 --> 00:37:45.397]  And we as believers have a task.
[00:37:45.397 --> 00:37:47.637]  We have a business to take care of.
[00:37:47.637 --> 00:37:53.960]  And we're supposed to take care of business up until the time that Christ returns, whenever that is.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.761]  And no man knows the day or the hour.
[00:37:55.761 --> 00:37:58.502]  And anybody that says that they do, they're lying to us.
[00:37:58.502 --> 00:38:02.683]  They don't know when Christ is coming until then we have a job to do.
[00:38:02.683 --> 00:38:06.185]  But what I see going on, and one of my major
[00:38:07.605 --> 00:38:20.193]  Consternations is the way that Christians use prophecy as an excuse for lethargy and apathy to sit back and do nothing to oppose the things that they know to be evil.
[00:38:20.193 --> 00:38:23.055]  If the believers in 1775 and 76, and the pastors specifically,
[00:38:27.176 --> 00:38:31.079]  would have acted the way that we are acting today in America.
[00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:33.301]  We would still be a crown colony of Great Britain.
[00:38:33.301 --> 00:38:34.542]  There would be no Bill of Rights.
[00:38:34.542 --> 00:38:36.223]  There'd be no Declaration of Independence.
[00:38:36.223 --> 00:38:37.024]  There'd be no U.S.
[00:38:37.024 --> 00:38:37.725]  Constitution.
[00:38:37.725 --> 00:38:41.828]  There'd be no freedom like we've enjoyed for these 200 plus years.
[00:38:41.828 --> 00:38:43.970]  They stood up and they opposed tyranny.
[00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:46.972]  They opposed the global order at that time.
[00:38:46.972 --> 00:38:48.673]  They did what was right to do.
[00:38:48.673 --> 00:38:51.115]  Most of these men and women were Christians.
[00:38:51.115 --> 00:38:56.820]  The pastors were on the front lines fighting for our freedoms, and they prevailed.
[00:38:57.338 --> 00:38:59.019]  But now, what are we doing today?
[00:38:59.019 --> 00:39:12.583]  We're sitting back, and we're, in the name of prophecy, in the name of Christianity, we are allowing the evil one to remove all of the fundamental freedoms that our forefathers fought and bled for.
[00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.063]  It's inexcusable!
[00:39:14.063 --> 00:39:23.566]  And we've got to get the preachers and the churches of America to awaken to what is happening, and to set in opposition that which is necessary.
[00:39:25.287 --> 00:39:30.072]  Well, again, I make the point, because we have a wide-ranging audience, even if you're not a Christian.
[00:39:30.072 --> 00:39:31.934]  Let's say you're an agnostic out there listening.
[00:39:31.934 --> 00:39:32.955]  Is it a good idea
[00:39:34.224 --> 00:39:39.986]  To have the federal government coming in and telling churches what they can and can't say under the 501c3?
[00:39:39.986 --> 00:39:46.369]  Is it good to have the churches twisting Romans 13, Hitler's favorite Bible passage about rendering unto Caesar?
[00:39:46.369 --> 00:39:55.673]  I mean, is it good to then have the majority of the nation that calls themselves Christians saying, I'm supposed to sit here and do nothing and not warn anybody?
[00:39:55.673 --> 00:39:58.654]  How could somebody not want to go out and fight this system?
[00:39:58.654 --> 00:40:01.035]  And again, folks, even if you don't believe in Revelation and all of that,
[00:40:01.855 --> 00:40:02.876]  Like I do.
[00:40:02.876 --> 00:40:10.683]  The point is, is that, is it a good idea to have a world government that you can't buy or sell without a thumbprint and a face scan?
[00:40:10.683 --> 00:40:12.785]  What type of control does that give government?
[00:40:12.785 --> 00:40:15.467]  And they are setting that system up.
[00:40:15.467 --> 00:40:17.529]  They are stating it is for tyranny.
[00:40:17.529 --> 00:40:19.230]  It is to bring in a one-child policy.
[00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:22.013]  It is to bring in feudalism, serfdom, eugenics.
[00:40:22.013 --> 00:40:24.234]  I mean, you know, it's not just that we have a global government forming.
[00:40:24.995 --> 00:40:33.458]  It's that it's run by a bunch of control freak tyrants, and then when you study what those control freak tyrants believe in, they're a cultist to a man.
[00:40:33.458 --> 00:40:42.882]  So, you know, I just encourage people to investigate what the world elite actually believe in, and then ask yourselves, why do they hate Christians so much?
[00:40:42.882 --> 00:40:45.903]  And I don't mean your big national TV preachers.
[00:40:45.903 --> 00:40:48.604]  I mean, why do they hate real Christians?
[00:40:48.604 --> 00:40:49.464]  Why is that, Pastor?
[00:40:50.697 --> 00:40:56.102]  Well, I think because they know that, you know, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty.
[00:40:56.102 --> 00:40:58.384]  Jesus Christ came to set men free.
[00:40:58.384 --> 00:41:02.967]  If the Son is so and shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
[00:41:02.967 --> 00:41:07.671]  Jesus is the personification of freedom.
[00:41:07.671 --> 00:41:10.554]  Stand fast in the liberty with which Christ has made us free.
[00:41:10.554 --> 00:41:11.975]  Galatians 5.1.
[00:41:11.975 --> 00:41:14.137]  But let's go back to your statement a minute ago.
[00:41:14.137 --> 00:41:18.981]  You know, I've said it last year when I was on the campaign trail all over the country, I said this.
[00:41:19.525 --> 00:41:22.907]  We either have freedom for all, or we have freedom for none.
[00:41:22.907 --> 00:41:31.053]  And it really doesn't matter whether a person is agnostic, or a Christian, or what his particular religious belief may or may not be.
[00:41:31.053 --> 00:41:36.216]  We either believe in the Constitution, the rule of law, the principles of the Declaration of Independence.
[00:41:36.216 --> 00:41:43.741]  We have freedom in this country to worship God the way we see fit, to not worship God if that's what we see fit, or we don't.
[00:41:43.741 --> 00:41:46.563]  And so whether a person comes from a theological point of view,
[00:41:47.097 --> 00:42:00.862]  Of any kind, or whether he comes from an atheistic point of view, although I believe that an agnostic and atheist has a difficult time understanding the real principles of freedom, because I believe those principles are rooted and grounded in the teachings of natural law, which are biblical.
[00:42:00.862 --> 00:42:08.965]  Regardless of what our particular personal philosophy might be, we either have freedom for everyone in this country, or we have freedom for none.
[00:42:08.965 --> 00:42:15.267]  And I think that is the key, and believe it or not, and this is one of the things when I was on the campaign trail last year that I really found amazing.
[00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:26.102]  I saw so many of my Christian, especially pastors, that seem to be in such a fog, Alex, they just didn't have a clue.
[00:42:26.102 --> 00:42:27.443]  They're under a spell!
[00:42:27.443 --> 00:42:29.004]  They're under a spell!
[00:42:29.004 --> 00:42:42.656]  Whether it's a 501c3 thing, or whether it's they're afraid of their church congregations, they're afraid of losing their retirement programs, or whatever it is, they're sitting out there in a fog, without a clue, and I found some people that were
[00:42:43.086 --> 00:42:48.830]  They would not identify themselves as churchgoers or Christians, and yet they're energized about fighting for freedom.
[00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:59.978]  And so, you know, I've said this before, you know, I would rather vote for an unbeliever, regardless of the office, whether it's president, whether it's congressman, senator, house rep, doesn't matter.
[00:42:59.978 --> 00:43:07.784]  I would rather vote for an unbeliever who will preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States than to vote for a believer
[00:43:08.433 --> 00:43:11.677]  Who would not preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States?
[00:43:11.677 --> 00:43:18.045]  But we know that's a trick question because they're not really believers in their heart if they're not fighting evil.
[00:43:19.062 --> 00:43:19.863]  Well, I understand that.
[00:43:19.863 --> 00:43:26.047]  What I'm saying is, you know, everybody, every two years, every four years, everybody professes to be a Christian.
[00:43:26.047 --> 00:43:29.690]  If you're running for office, people don't come out to vote for me.
[00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:30.490]  I'm an agnostic.
[00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:30.990]  Exactly.
[00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:32.091]  I don't want to hear a talk.
[00:43:32.091 --> 00:43:33.532]  I want to see action.
[00:43:33.532 --> 00:43:33.973]  Exactly.
[00:43:33.973 --> 00:43:41.458]  But the point is, is that the oath that every officeholder takes, from federal, state, local, doesn't matter, the oath they take,
[00:43:42.122 --> 00:43:45.365]  Is to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[00:43:45.365 --> 00:43:45.946]  Yes.
[00:43:45.946 --> 00:43:47.688]  And that's what we need to hold them to.
[00:43:47.688 --> 00:43:49.009]  And they're not doing it.
[00:43:49.009 --> 00:43:56.356]  We the people, fortunately for the vast part, have not held our elected officials accountable to the Constitution.
[00:43:56.356 --> 00:44:00.000]  And that includes Republicans, Democrats, it doesn't matter what side of the aisle.
[00:44:00.347 --> 00:44:13.056]  And until we begin to hold our elected representatives accountable to the Declaration, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution of the United States, we are not going to have good government and we are not going to maintain freedom in this country.
[00:44:13.056 --> 00:44:13.737]  That's right.
[00:44:13.737 --> 00:44:20.281]  Now, the clergy response teams, I mean, we have now 26,000 preachers covertly hired by FEMA.
[00:44:20.281 --> 00:44:23.744]  It's now declassified, years after we broke it here on the network.
[00:44:25.919 --> 00:44:28.420]  I mean, this, again, is another sign of classical tyranny.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.081]  And, Pastor, I don't know if you've seen this.
[00:44:31.081 --> 00:44:35.062]  We just broke it yesterday at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:35.062 --> 00:44:49.308]  Have you seen the AmeriCorps paramilitary propaganda ad where they're in red and black uniforms with khakis, literally, like something out of a fascist science fiction movie?
[00:44:49.308 --> 00:44:52.189]  And then it dovetails... I have not seen it.
[00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:55.130]  Yeah, I have not seen it, but I will go to your website and take a look at it.
[00:44:55.799 --> 00:44:59.881]  And then it dovetails with Government Ready's Youth Corps to take on vets.
[00:44:59.881 --> 00:45:13.748]  We see these drills with the Boy Scouts and with public school groups all over the country, where in the scenarios where they have the 14-year-olds training to take over, you know, law enforcement operations, that they're fighting veterans and gun owners.
[00:45:13.748 --> 00:45:17.609]  And then that dovetails with the MIAC report and the DHS report.
[00:45:17.609 --> 00:45:20.511]  I mean, we have a clear picture now of what's going on here.
[00:45:21.621 --> 00:45:23.082]  Yeah, that's incredible.
[00:45:23.082 --> 00:45:24.343]  I'll be glad to go take a look at that.
[00:45:24.343 --> 00:45:27.464]  I'm glad that you have put that up.
[00:45:27.464 --> 00:45:33.188]  You know, really, it goes back to what we said at the outset of our discussion, the speed at which these things are taking place.
[00:45:33.188 --> 00:45:35.309]  It's really difficult to imagine.
[00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:45.875]  You know, when we first broke, when you broke the DHS report, actually MIAC came from DHS in Missouri, and then I picked it up in my column and it went viral.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:51.323]  Uh, and then the, you know, the support began to flood into the state of Missouri.
[00:45:51.323 --> 00:45:56.746]  They've since rescinded that report and they dismissed the person that put it out.
[00:45:56.746 --> 00:46:05.451]  Uh, then it came to the DHS report and, and the same thing, you know, people, even a few congressmen began to speak out against it, believe it or not.
[00:46:05.451 --> 00:46:08.253]  And, and then that report was since taken down.
[00:46:08.253 --> 00:46:11.115]  And then you've got Peter King's bill that we started out talking about.
[00:46:11.115 --> 00:46:14.817]  And then the other bill that you've just, uh, brought out to my attention here today,
[00:46:16.254 --> 00:46:21.798]  You know, these things are all, to use your phrase, dovetailing together.
[00:46:21.798 --> 00:46:25.440]  There's no question that there is a connection between all of this.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:32.546]  Anybody who thinks that these things are being done independently, separately, without connection, they don't see the big picture.
[00:46:32.546 --> 00:46:43.334]  There's no doubt that all of this is dovetailing into a common purpose, a common goal, and I think really the ultimate goal here is to disarm the American people.
[00:46:44.826 --> 00:47:01.676]  You know, when you look back over our history, the only reason why we are still, at least in some semblance, of the maintenance of freedom today, the only reason we have that maintenance is because of the Second Amendment.
[00:47:01.676 --> 00:47:07.279]  That's right, and if the globalists get that, as the UN has said, they will have their world government.
[00:47:07.279 --> 00:47:09.340]  Yeah, there's no question about it.
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:12.622]  I mean, how fortunate we were that our founding fathers
[00:47:13.243 --> 00:47:26.634]  We're sagacious enough to put that Second Amendment in the Constitution, and that solid historic gun culture that we've had throughout our history has really been the salvation of our liberties to this point.
[00:47:26.634 --> 00:47:35.841]  And I think there's no question that they recognize, the globalists recognize this, and now they're coming at this from a multifaceted perspective.
[00:47:36.385 --> 00:47:47.476]  To try, and I think the goal is to disarm the American people, because without the ability of the American people to defend themselves, we are helpless against the imaginations of evil men.
[00:47:48.154 --> 00:47:50.134]  Well, Pastor, there's no debate.
[00:47:50.134 --> 00:48:10.019]  I mean, you have the White House Chief of Staff, the Attorney General, and the President all introducing legislation in the past, or arguing before federal courts, or writing books and giving speeches, and introducing legislation, saying they want a total ban on the American people's firearms, and then the asinine mainstream media is saying we're conspiracy theorists?
[00:48:10.019 --> 00:48:11.359]  You know, that this is just a
[00:48:12.219 --> 00:48:14.342]  A run on guns for no reason?
[00:48:14.342 --> 00:48:18.266]  I mean, this tactic they have of always denying.
[00:48:18.266 --> 00:48:19.648]  Let's take some calls.
[00:48:19.648 --> 00:48:21.070]  Let's talk to Paul in Ohio.
[00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:22.631]  Paul, you're on the air with Dr...
[00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:26.711]  Baldwin, go ahead.
[00:48:26.711 --> 00:48:27.511]  Are you there?
[00:48:27.511 --> 00:48:28.631]  Yes, we are.
[00:48:28.631 --> 00:48:31.232]  Okay, they come and took all my guns the other day.
[00:48:31.232 --> 00:48:32.572]  No warrant, no nothing.
[00:48:32.572 --> 00:48:42.575]  They come into my house, they took every one of them that they could see, but I've been listening to you, buddy, and I've been paying way good attention because I hit a bunch of them, and they didn't get them all.
[00:48:42.575 --> 00:48:43.735]  Why did they say they took your guns?
[00:48:47.416 --> 00:48:49.859]  No warrant, no cause, no reason.
[00:48:49.859 --> 00:48:52.641]  They come in and took every gun that they could find.
[00:48:52.641 --> 00:48:55.124]  They searched my home from top to bottom.
[00:48:55.124 --> 00:49:00.409]  Let me stop you and then I want to hear about this and then get Pastor Baldwin's take on it.
[00:49:00.409 --> 00:49:11.340]  Look, I have three articles in my stack I haven't even gotten to where somebody buys 10,000 rounds of ammo at the gun store, the VATF pulls them over down the street,
[00:49:12.455 --> 00:49:19.098]  Takes them to jail and gives them half a million dollar bail, saying the ammo's illegal, saying it's an arsenal.
[00:49:19.098 --> 00:49:26.081]  And they're now sending BATF under Homeland Security to people's houses who buy a thousand rounds.
[00:49:26.081 --> 00:49:35.286]  Again, acting like it's illegal, and then they got in the newspaper, then they confiscated three handguns from the man's house, and it goes on to say the guy has no criminal record.
[00:49:35.286 --> 00:49:41.389]  I have these in the stack today, and so this is going on, and I'm going to hold you over, Paul, but
[00:49:42.669 --> 00:49:47.051]  I mean, that's another point, Chuck Baldwin.
[00:49:47.051 --> 00:49:50.112]  I know you're seeing these reports.
[00:49:50.112 --> 00:49:53.854]  I see these reports every day where they just arrest people for the Second Amendment.
[00:49:53.854 --> 00:49:55.655]  What is going on?
[00:49:55.655 --> 00:49:59.336]  Yeah, that is incredible.
[00:49:59.336 --> 00:50:02.017]  And I think we know what's going on.
[00:50:02.017 --> 00:50:05.199]  It's the stuff that you talk about every day on your show.
[00:50:05.199 --> 00:50:05.939]  I write about it.
[00:50:05.939 --> 00:50:09.281]  There's a few others out there that are trying to sound the clarion call.
[00:50:09.281 --> 00:50:10.281]  We know what's going on.
[00:50:11.694 --> 00:50:21.218]  And Alex, I really think that ultimately the maintenance of freedom is going to come down to the states.
[00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:28.741]  And I don't know if you find that encouraging or discouraging, but I think it began with the states, and I think it's going to end with the states.
[00:50:28.741 --> 00:50:36.444]  We are either going to maintain the freedoms that we find enumerated in the Bill of Rights at the state level,
[00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:39.652]  Well, I think we are not going to maintain freedom at all.
[00:50:39.652 --> 00:50:40.233]  I agree with you.
[00:50:40.233 --> 00:50:42.555]  I think about 80% of the battle is there.
[00:50:42.555 --> 00:50:46.498]  We need to stay on the feds and all the treason going on and document it and try to resist it.
[00:50:46.498 --> 00:50:48.820]  But the real power is at the state level.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:54.345]  That's why we need more than 8% turnout in state elections instead of 50-something nationally.
[00:50:54.345 --> 00:50:56.307]  The national stuff serves as a distraction.
[00:50:56.307 --> 00:50:56.968]  Paul, stay there.
[00:50:56.968 --> 00:50:58.729]  I want to hear your story when we get back.
[00:50:58.729 --> 00:50:59.230]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.181 --> 00:51:05.463]  Less than a century ago, half of the American public grew much of their own food.
[00:51:05.463 --> 00:51:09.845]  Today, it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own food.
[00:51:09.845 --> 00:51:14.348]  During the Great Depression, over 18 million people suffered from starvation.
[00:51:14.348 --> 00:51:20.551]  And as America continues down its current path, for many, the reality of another depression is a very serious concern.
[00:51:21.091 --> 00:51:28.760]  With massive layoffs and unemployment at record levels, growing your own food will help you save money that you'd normally spend at the grocery store.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:34.867]  Invest in your family's future by stocking up with your very own supply of seeds available from GetSeeds.net.
[00:51:35.848 --> 00:51:36.128]  I think so.
[00:52:00.731 --> 00:52:02.231]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.231 --> 00:52:07.613]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[00:52:07.613 --> 00:52:10.034]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[00:52:10.034 --> 00:52:18.956]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout
[00:52:19.056 --> 00:52:19.616]  We're good to go.
[00:52:43.937 --> 00:52:44.237]  We're good.
[00:53:00.891 --> 00:53:04.912]  Today, we cannot afford to ignore the current state of our country.
[00:53:04.912 --> 00:53:08.073]  The economy, job layoffs, mass foreclosures.
[00:53:08.073 --> 00:53:12.594]  And now, we are all at risk of being exposed to this new flu pandemic.
[00:53:12.594 --> 00:53:17.435]  The Center for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency across the United States.
[00:53:17.435 --> 00:53:19.096]  What can you do to prepare yourself?

[00:53:50.435 --> 00:53:52.435]  Protecting you and your family, one day at a time.
[00:54:12.775 --> 00:54:30.987]  Alright, Paul in Ohio, you're on the air with Dr. Chuck Baldwin, presidential candidate 2008, the nominee for the Constitution Party.
[00:54:30.987 --> 00:54:35.931]  Okay, just in a nutshell, Paul, it's very upsetting to hear your story.
[00:54:37.059 --> 00:54:42.861]  But I've got news articles stacked up where they just come, they take your guns, they take your ammo, and they say you shouldn't have had it.
[00:54:42.861 --> 00:54:50.082]  Most stories I see, he's an insurance salesman, 54, he told his neighbors they ought to get storable food because the economy might collapse.
[00:54:50.082 --> 00:54:53.303]  The neighbors were scared to see him loading a firearm in his car.
[00:54:53.303 --> 00:54:57.584]  So police SWAT teamed him, took the ammo and guns, and he's held without bail.
[00:54:57.584 --> 00:55:01.585]  And then the article never says he's charged, and later it comes out they're not charged.
[00:55:01.585 --> 00:55:02.866]  It's just insane!
[00:55:04.059 --> 00:55:05.100]  This is the strangest story.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.442]  They were after me because of my energy cell.
[00:55:21.059 --> 00:55:23.521]  And they came into my sister's house.
[00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:25.382]  Now this is not my house.
[00:55:25.382 --> 00:55:31.286]  They came into her house, took my nephew's guns, took her guns and everything like that because they want me.
[00:55:31.286 --> 00:55:36.009]  They're looking for me because of what I can do to save people gas.
[00:55:36.009 --> 00:55:43.734]  I believe that if I'm able to finish what system I've got right now, that I would absolutely be able to create enough electricity for every person to have.
[00:55:43.734 --> 00:55:45.275]  Send me an email then, Paul.
[00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:46.536]  I appreciate your call.
[00:55:46.536 --> 00:55:47.757]  Chris in California.
[00:55:47.757 --> 00:55:48.618]  Chris, you're on the air.
[00:55:48.618 --> 00:55:48.958]  Go ahead.
[00:55:50.612 --> 00:55:55.877]  Hi, yeah, I was just calling because I wanted to touch on the subject you were talking about earlier.
[00:55:55.877 --> 00:56:12.192]  I wanted to make a point that when it comes down to it, they're going to start getting divisive, guys, and I want everybody out there, like black, white, Mexican, just to touch across aisles, the different races, just so that, you know, they won't try to, when they try to start pointing a finger at each other,
[00:56:12.594 --> 00:56:16.295]  You know, you guys can be there to kind of mediate it and wake up, you know.
[00:56:16.295 --> 00:56:22.197]  Well, I wish we were reaching that many people to be able to mediate it, but you're absolutely right, Chris.
[00:56:22.197 --> 00:56:31.501]  The liberals, in the name of stopping racism, all they do is talk about it, hype it up, say you're a racist if you disagree with Obama, injecting race.
[00:56:31.501 --> 00:56:35.842]  So does the controlled right wing with, you know, Limbaugh playing the songs he plays.
[00:56:35.842 --> 00:56:38.603]  That is all meant to divide us.
[00:56:38.603 --> 00:56:40.124]  Pastor Baldwin, he's got a great point.
[00:56:41.866 --> 00:56:42.986]  Oh, there's no question.
[00:56:42.986 --> 00:56:45.167]  Again, we have freedom for all or freedom for none.
[00:56:45.167 --> 00:56:53.389]  This cuts across not just theological lines, but racial lines, educational lines, every other division that we have.
[00:56:53.389 --> 00:56:55.889]  I mean, freedom is universal.
[00:56:55.889 --> 00:57:04.732]  And the beauty of what we're doing here is we're talking about the issue of freedom, constitutional government, liberty, etc.
[00:57:04.732 --> 00:57:10.193]  As you said, it's the other side that interjects race and uses it to divide us, and we can't afford to let that happen.
[00:57:12.401 --> 00:57:14.603]  Absolutely, great point.
[00:57:14.603 --> 00:57:15.223]  And thank you.
[00:57:15.223 --> 00:57:16.624]  Anything else, Chris?
[00:57:16.624 --> 00:57:29.573]  Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, those firefighters guys out there, anybody who's fighting fires, a firefighter, you guys, I've been watching the news and I've seen those guys didn't get the promotion because, you know, based on color.
[00:57:29.573 --> 00:57:42.042]  And I feel like, you know, if you're if you're a firefighter, no matter what color, black, you know, Mexican, I really want to see African-Americans step up and just say that, you know, you know, you guys don't support that because the media is just looking like it's one sided and it's kind of
[00:57:42.594 --> 00:57:45.576]  And I can see how they're going to use that to kind of, you know... No, exactly.
[00:57:45.576 --> 00:57:53.701]  The elite... Look, the elite are talking about $100 and $200 and $300 expense accounts in England instead of trillions that have been stolen.
[00:57:53.701 --> 00:57:56.143]  They always focus in on petty things to distract us.
[00:57:56.143 --> 00:57:57.304]  I appreciate your call, Chris.
[00:57:58.004 --> 00:58:04.466]  We're going to talk to Pastor Terry, Jason, and Rick and others after Pastor Chuck Baldwin, Dr. Baldwin, leaves us.
[00:58:04.466 --> 00:58:06.987]  Dr. Baldwin, what's the best site for folks to visit?
[00:58:06.987 --> 00:58:08.868]  ChuckBaldwinLive.com?
[00:58:08.868 --> 00:58:11.489]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:58:11.489 --> 00:58:15.490]  www.ChuckBaldwinLive.com.
[00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:17.451]  All right.
[00:58:17.451 --> 00:58:21.192]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, and thanks for getting the great articles out, breaking down what's happening.
[00:58:21.192 --> 00:58:21.512]  Take care.
[00:58:22.394 --> 00:58:23.475]  Thanks a lot.
[00:58:23.475 --> 00:58:24.076]  Talk to you soon.
[00:58:24.076 --> 00:58:27.899]  Okay, folks, when we get back, more of your calls, but I want to break down these bills.
[00:58:27.899 --> 00:58:29.480]  Let me explain this again.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:31.842]  Introduced racing through the House.
[00:58:31.842 --> 00:58:33.083]  White House support.
[00:58:33.083 --> 00:58:36.026]  Bill in Congress would ban gun ownership at will.
[00:58:36.026 --> 00:58:38.288]  The most draconian gun law ever.
[00:58:38.288 --> 00:58:42.291]  Stay with us.
[00:58:42.291 --> 00:58:45.894]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.894 --> 00:58:47.735]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.874 --> 00:58:59.506]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:58:59.506 --> 00:59:04.373]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[00:59:04.373 --> 00:59:05.995]  Deficiency in any one
[00:59:06.175 --> 00:59:06.655]  We're good to go.
[00:59:31.917 --> 00:59:37.899]  Many foods today have herbicides, pesticides, fungicides and insecticides that were not intended for human consumption.

[01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:13.202]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.202 --> 01:00:17.404]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.404 --> 01:00:21.446]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:35.865]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.TV simulcasting the last two and a half hours of this radio show.
[01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:40.188]  We always go live the last two hours, but today we'll go live 30 minutes early, 12.30 Central Standard Time.
[01:00:40.188 --> 01:00:48.514]  Paul Dornanew joining us from somewhere on the road, leaving Greece, driving back into Romania.
[01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:50.316]  He got arrested, so many others being arrested.
[01:00:50.316 --> 01:00:52.897]  We'll get a report from him.
[01:00:52.897 --> 01:00:55.940]  Then we have a very famous individual, the inventor.
[01:00:58.206 --> 01:01:05.848]  of some key operating systems that are well known to folks.
[01:01:05.848 --> 01:01:12.630]  He'll be joining us coming up later in the show, Richard Stallman.
[01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:15.210]  So stay with us.
[01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:20.592]  On that front, he is the inventor of GNU Linux.
[01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:38.660]  I want to continue with your phone calls, and after we cover the Bilderberg Group, in the next hour I'm going to detail all this with shots on the screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, and video clips, and you name it.
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:43.442]  The overall takeover plan of the Globalist, but we'll give you the pieces of that first.
[01:01:43.442 --> 01:01:45.703]  Bill in Congress would ban gun ownership at will.
[01:01:45.703 --> 01:01:48.184]  That's coming up in the next segment, how it dovetails.
[01:01:48.184 --> 01:01:54.306]  Let's go ahead and talk now to Pastor Terry in Ohio.
[01:01:54.306 --> 01:01:55.426]  Go ahead, Pastor Terry.
[01:01:56.738 --> 01:01:59.500]  Yes, Alex.
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.141]  Hello?
[01:02:00.141 --> 01:02:01.342]  Yeah, mm-hmm.
[01:02:01.342 --> 01:02:10.249]  Okay, hey Alex, I'm the pastor that called you about getting the letter from Homeland Security, and I am getting that to you.
[01:02:10.249 --> 01:02:17.575]  I had to wait for it to come back from another organization that wanted it to help me see what I can do about it.
[01:02:17.575 --> 01:02:18.116]  And also,
[01:02:19.195 --> 01:02:23.737]  I wanted to share with you, I sure did wish I could get on there with Mr. Baldwin.
[01:02:23.737 --> 01:02:24.938]  Well, let me give you an idea.
[01:02:24.938 --> 01:02:32.201]  If you have a letter, you can just make photocopies of it and then not wait while it goes to one person and then back to you.
[01:02:32.201 --> 01:02:32.921]  Yeah, I know.
[01:02:32.921 --> 01:02:34.662]  I messed up on that one.
[01:02:34.662 --> 01:02:36.423]  Oh, so you'd already mailed it out?
[01:02:36.423 --> 01:02:37.143]  Yeah.
[01:02:37.143 --> 01:02:38.924]  Why don't you refresh people's memory?
[01:02:38.924 --> 01:02:39.904]  Hold on just a second.
[01:02:39.904 --> 01:02:40.985]  Hold on just a second.
[01:02:40.985 --> 01:02:43.946]  A lot of folks didn't hear that one call weeks ago.
[01:02:43.946 --> 01:02:46.307]  Why don't you recap so people know what we're talking about?
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:59.089]  Okay, I received, uh, two letters from Department of Homeland Security, and, uh, and it was Homeland Security slash FEMA, and I'm just a little home church.
[01:02:59.089 --> 01:03:09.517]  So, I figure, the way I consider it, I figure I got it by mistake, because they've been hitting the bigger churches, and boy have I got more information for you for that, too.
[01:03:09.517 --> 01:03:12.660]  They've actually hit them here, too, but I'll give you that.
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:13.961]  But anyway, I got the letter,
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:21.366]  Of course, they were saying, you know, me being 501c3 or 3c exempt and all that, which we're not.
[01:03:21.366 --> 01:03:25.029]  We chose not to be that, which was a mistake.
[01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:41.224]  And second of all, they stated that in case of an emergency, they may need the clergy or the pastors in given areas to help them in the safeguarding of people, directing them, you know, to certain areas, things like that.
[01:03:42.674 --> 01:03:46.195]  And then once you're recruited, for those that don't know, it's the Clergy Response Team.
[01:03:46.195 --> 01:03:47.375]  They want to recruit all the preachers.
[01:03:47.375 --> 01:03:49.036]  They're up to 26,000.
[01:03:49.036 --> 01:03:57.998]  Last time we checked, too covertly, because we got the training manuals, tell them to go to FEMA camps, tell them to take shots, tell them to turn their guns in, to preach Romans 13.
[01:03:57.998 --> 01:04:01.799]  Then we had mainline preachers on national news saying the same thing.
[01:04:01.799 --> 01:04:03.880]  So now even home churches are getting these.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.760]  And I don't think it was a mistake you not signing up for the 501c3.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.441]  You waive your liberties and your freedoms.
[01:04:09.941 --> 01:04:10.081]  Okay.
[01:04:10.081 --> 01:04:10.241]  Okay.
[01:04:10.241 --> 01:04:12.422]  I got the letter and they're quoting Romans, uh, chapter 13, verses 1 through 7.
[01:04:36.297 --> 01:04:48.502]  Well it's their own interpretation just like it was that woman's own interpretation here Sunday or the other day when I was listening to you because she mentioned a pastor that told me that I was me reading from a
[01:04:49.332 --> 01:04:50.253]  The wrong version.
[01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:53.734]  Well, I actually read from the King James and I gave the definition.
[01:04:53.734 --> 01:04:54.455]  Look, whatever.
[01:04:54.455 --> 01:04:56.396]  The government isn't supposed to be running religion.
[01:04:56.396 --> 01:04:57.016]  Hitler did it.
[01:04:57.016 --> 01:04:58.537]  It's classic tyranny.
[01:04:58.537 --> 01:04:59.938]  Stay there, okay, folks?
[01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:01.058]  You don't have to go to FEMA camps.

[01:06:01.585 --> 01:06:04.146]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:06:04.782 --> 01:06:06.820]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.612 --> 01:06:13.494]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:06:13.494 --> 01:06:19.996]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:19.996 --> 01:06:21.977]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:21.977 --> 01:06:24.437]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:06:24.437 --> 01:06:35.301]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:06:37.623 --> 01:06:39.285]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.285 --> 01:06:41.146]  It's about a one world government.
[01:06:41.146 --> 01:06:48.053]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:07:52.219 --> 01:07:52.419]  That's 888-654-3447.
[01:08:02.262 --> 01:08:08.906]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.906 --> 01:08:11.888]  It's Alex Jones, and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.014 --> 01:08:40.268]  You know, I can't even believe that we have to argue with people that you're not supposed to have multi-million person domestic armies marching around in red and black uniforms now all openly being announced and they're marching in cities near you that they're training public school children from the sixth grade and up how to write dossiers on their parents and how to tattle on their parents and how to tattle on their parents for not
[01:08:40.868 --> 01:08:49.591]  You know, being good environmental stewards and washing the bed sheets more than, you know, once every two weeks or taking too long a bath or taking a bath.
[01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:57.274]  And the news, everywhere, glorifies the children and says, oh look, they're bossing their parents around.
[01:08:57.274 --> 01:09:04.798]  The Marine Corps to get around Posse Comitatus is announcing they're going to create their own domestic police force that will also police the American people.
[01:09:04.798 --> 01:09:06.979]  Marine Corps civilian police.
[01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:10.982]  All over the nation, regular Army and Marines are running illegal checkpoints.
[01:09:10.982 --> 01:09:12.202]  We told people in 2007, no 2006,
[01:09:15.464 --> 01:09:22.871]  We got the secret FEMA documents that they had 13,000 preachers covertly trained to tell their flocks to go to FEMA camps to take forced inoculations.
[01:09:24.264 --> 01:09:26.645]  To turn their guns in, Romans 13.
[01:09:26.645 --> 01:09:31.748]  Then it came out in mainstream news 2008, early 2008.
[01:09:31.748 --> 01:09:44.494]  National newscasts, local newscasts, we played them here with preachers saying it's Romans 13 that the people are bad and gotta do what their government says and the government's number one threat is us the people and we need the army to take our guns, it's of the Lord.
[01:09:44.494 --> 01:09:46.775]  I mean you can't make this stuff up.
[01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:55.122]  Now they've got all these bills introduced to restrict free speech and arrest you for free speech and to take your guns and put you on secret list.
[01:09:55.122 --> 01:10:12.798]  And yeah, they're sending out, we've confirmed this, we've got tons of these letters and things coming in, where the preachers are being told, and I told you Raymond Teague two years ago came in from his big Baptist church in Dripping Springs, and they told him, they said, he brought me the letter.
[01:10:12.798 --> 01:10:13.639]  And it was his preachers.
[01:10:15.714 --> 01:10:20.219]  Got up and said in the sermon, don't talk about in the parking lot if you go to a church dinner.
[01:10:20.219 --> 01:10:25.125]  The members can't talk about politics or who they support coming up in the 2008 election.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.721]  You know, now the people don't have free speech.
[01:10:28.721 --> 01:10:30.563]  If you're a Christian, you don't have free speech.
[01:10:30.563 --> 01:10:40.190]  Folks, let's say Christians are knock-kneed, gelded, conditioned, brainwashed, and let's just say you believe you're supposed to worship government and do whatever it says.
[01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:49.757]  And the Founding Fathers were bad, and we were bad to fight Hitler, and all governments of God, and Jesus should have done what the devil said, because he's the God of this world, and he offered him the whole world up on the mountain.
[01:10:50.936 --> 01:11:04.309]  Let's just say that's the case, and the Communist Chinese Church, you know, the church of the state that told Christians it was of God to worship the government, the Soviet-controlled church was good, and the East German-controlled church was good, and, you know, the Cuban-controlled church was good.
[01:11:04.309 --> 01:11:07.212]  Let's just say all of that is good and government's supposed to run religion.
[01:11:08.817 --> 01:11:17.666]  But wait a minute, the First Amendment, the Bill of Rights says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:11:17.666 --> 01:11:20.509]  So this is a government for and by the people.
[01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:23.332]  So we're supposed to follow the Bill of Rights and it says it's illegal
[01:11:24.153 --> 01:11:26.075]  To have government involved in religion.
[01:11:26.075 --> 01:11:29.858]  And see, the controlled left always said, oh, you're not supposed to be able to have a Bible in school.
[01:11:29.858 --> 01:11:31.419]  They throw in the trash all the time.
[01:11:31.419 --> 01:11:33.660]  They arrest you if you're caught with them.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:37.343]  You know, if you try to go pray on a campus, they arrest you, you know.
[01:11:37.343 --> 01:11:40.686]  Alan Keyes, still in jail for a week and a half, by the way.
[01:11:40.686 --> 01:11:44.389]  They're saying, well, we're going to keep you in jail because you prayed.
[01:11:44.389 --> 01:11:47.892]  You know, for Notre Dame.
[01:11:47.892 --> 01:11:49.633]  And so they set this precedent.
[01:11:54.012 --> 01:11:58.093]  And you're not supposed to have the government doing this.
[01:11:58.093 --> 01:11:59.454]  I mean, that's so creepy.
[01:11:59.454 --> 01:12:01.134]  That's such tyranny.
[01:12:01.134 --> 01:12:03.295]  That's so 1984.
[01:12:03.295 --> 01:12:09.257]  And I get these hundreds of emails a week, and I see them on our YouTube videos going, Alex Jones is of the devil.
[01:12:09.257 --> 01:12:11.438]  He should submit to Government Romans 13.
[01:12:11.438 --> 01:12:16.139]  And these people, you go to their subsites on YouTube, they really believe it.
[01:12:16.139 --> 01:12:20.401]  And they're the soft, weak, really demonic Christians.
[01:12:21.865 --> 01:12:27.308]  And they just revel in worshipping government and revel in having no responsibility and revel.
[01:12:27.308 --> 01:12:31.970]  And when they have their kids taken by the government for no reasons, they praise God and say, oh, it's the end of the world.
[01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:32.990]  I'll be raptured soon.
[01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:34.871]  Listen, you delusional fruitcakes.
[01:12:34.871 --> 01:12:37.192]  You're not going to be raptured, okay?
[01:12:37.192 --> 01:12:44.696]  And just from a secular perspective, you are cowardly, sickening people who don't face down evil in any way.
[01:12:44.696 --> 01:12:47.517]  You really think the creator of the universe wants anything to do with you?
[01:12:47.517 --> 01:12:48.858]  You are pathetic.
[01:12:50.287 --> 01:12:53.435]  You are disgusting!
[01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:57.486]  But regardless, it's up to people who aren't under the fake church control.
[01:12:59.912 --> 01:13:04.757]  And it's up to people, no matter what your religious beliefs are, if you aren't religious, to fight evil.
[01:13:04.757 --> 01:13:06.158]  We know this is tyranny.
[01:13:06.158 --> 01:13:09.601]  We know foreign banks stealing $14.8 trillion is illegal.
[01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:15.927]  We know the CPS with no due process stealing people's kids with their phony family courts is wrong.
[01:13:15.927 --> 01:13:22.734]  We know rocket fuel and 90% of the baby formula and melamine and 90% of it and mercury
[01:13:23.554 --> 01:13:33.522]  And over half the corn syrup and all the brain damage and cancer and corruption and sodium fluoride and forced medication in the water supply is wrong.
[01:13:33.522 --> 01:13:36.805]  We know foreign private banks ruling our nation is wrong.
[01:13:36.805 --> 01:13:39.007]  We know the attack on our freedoms is wrong.
[01:13:39.007 --> 01:13:45.352]  And all of you phony, sickening, disgusting, fake conservative Christians need to get out of the way.
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:58.011]  You know, you supported George Bush when he said they were having secret arrests and secret torture, and now you whine and complain when you find out Homeland Security is really for conservatives and gun owners.
[01:13:58.011 --> 01:14:00.313]  What did you expect, you stupid fools?
[01:14:00.313 --> 01:14:02.956]  You're the ones that own property and are middle class.
[01:14:02.956 --> 01:14:04.497]  You're the targets.
[01:14:04.497 --> 01:14:07.340]  Now, Pastor Terry was calling from Ohio.
[01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:20.144]  He has a home church, I think he said 30 members, and he even got the letter telling him, look, you're 501c3, which he's not, you're under orders, no free speech, you don't criticize the government.
[01:14:20.144 --> 01:14:28.405]  Well, even under the 501c3 baloney, you can criticize government policies and abortion and things, it's just you can't endorse political candidates.
[01:14:28.405 --> 01:14:30.666]  But see, even under that, they've expanded it.
[01:14:31.266 --> 01:14:33.267]  But see, that's the lawyer trick.
[01:14:33.267 --> 01:14:47.356]  Just like there's no law you gotta take a vaccine, they trick you and the school kicks you out, and then they put in truancy laws into place to then say you've been truant and they come arrest you and your kid.
[01:14:47.356 --> 01:14:49.617]  But you're not being arrested for no shot.
[01:14:49.617 --> 01:14:50.698]  It's a lawyer trick.
[01:14:52.133 --> 01:14:52.833]  Same thing here.
[01:14:52.833 --> 01:14:55.255]  Oh, they go, oh, the 50s didn't have 501c3.
[01:14:55.255 --> 01:14:59.017]  They said, oh, churches, yeah, you're tax exempt, just fill out this form.
[01:14:59.017 --> 01:15:02.879]  And trusting Americans, you know, we'd won World War II, we were the good guys.
[01:15:02.879 --> 01:15:07.822]  The churches said, oh, yeah, there's a new government wants us just to, you know, we have our tax exemption.
[01:15:08.522 --> 01:15:15.204]  And I've seen the old 50s forms, they even lied and said, oh we know you have a First Amendment, just we need you to do this for tax reasons.
[01:15:15.204 --> 01:15:32.109]  And the big denominations, taken over by the World Council of Churches, financed by the UN and the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation, told the Baptists and the Methodists and the Catholics and all the big Christian, you know, faiths, denominations, just fill this out.
[01:15:33.038 --> 01:15:34.019]  And so they did it.
[01:15:34.019 --> 01:15:36.262]  Then they went to small churches and said, do this.
[01:15:36.262 --> 01:15:39.246]  Then they SWAT teamed a few and so most of them got scared and did it in the 80s.
[01:15:41.107 --> 01:15:46.609]  Congress can make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:53.271]  And look, I know a bunch of you party and you go to the dance halls and you don't want to hear about religion.
[01:15:53.271 --> 01:15:54.432]  Okay.
[01:15:54.432 --> 01:15:57.753]  Over 200 million people call themselves Christians in this nation.
[01:15:57.753 --> 01:16:00.494]  Hundreds of millions every week go to church.
[01:16:00.494 --> 01:16:02.914]  This matters politically to everybody.
[01:16:02.914 --> 01:16:04.615]  That the government's taken over the church.
[01:16:04.615 --> 01:16:09.757]  Remember the Democrats didn't like Bush and the $10 billion a year for faith-based initiative?
[01:16:09.757 --> 01:16:10.417]  To buy them off?
[01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:15.299]  And now Obama's saying he's going to double that and suddenly the Democrats love it?
[01:16:15.299 --> 01:16:17.459]  It's bipartisan!
[01:16:17.459 --> 01:16:20.039]  So whatever happened to separation of church and state?
[01:16:20.039 --> 01:16:29.481]  It means the churches can do whatever they want, but the government can't be involved because you have no jurisdiction.
[01:16:29.481 --> 01:16:36.102]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:16:36.102 --> 01:16:39.003]  You have no purview, but they trick you and say, oh, you're a charity.
[01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:45.012]  Sign into this 501c3.
[01:16:45.012 --> 01:16:46.393]  And they did it.
[01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:49.634]  And now 50-something years later, we're in bondage.
[01:16:49.634 --> 01:16:50.474]  Now, I'm done ranting.
[01:16:50.474 --> 01:16:51.975]  I said I'd take your calls.
[01:16:51.975 --> 01:16:55.676]  Pastor Terry, just finish up about this letter.
[01:16:55.676 --> 01:17:06.941]  Okay, I got this letter, and what I did was I have people, you know, wanted to see it so they could help me out in it legally, and that's why I allowed it to go out.
[01:17:06.941 --> 01:17:08.742]  Well, I'm getting it back, and you're going to get it.
[01:17:09.286 --> 01:17:10.787]  And something else, Alex.
[01:17:10.787 --> 01:17:11.627]  You can say whatever you want.
[01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.428]  I already have hundreds, but sure, go ahead.
[01:17:13.428 --> 01:17:14.088]  Okay.
[01:17:14.088 --> 01:17:15.769]  And something else, too.
[01:17:15.769 --> 01:17:21.112]  I listen to you and Steve Quayle, and everything you have said has come to pass.
[01:17:21.112 --> 01:17:29.936]  And I tell you what, I've listened to you, and I even go a little deeper, because when I teach, I like to teach the same way Christ did.
[01:17:29.936 --> 01:17:35.079]  You know, put a little modern-day history in with what's going on in the world so people would understand.
[01:17:35.079 --> 01:17:35.739]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:17:36.488 --> 01:17:43.414]  And the information I get from your show and such helps me, but I also get online and get information too.
[01:17:43.414 --> 01:17:53.122]  And you know, back at the beginning of this country, before there was even a constitution, when people began to fight against England, against their tyranny,
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.321]  They used God's Word to stand up and do it.
[01:17:56.321 --> 01:17:57.661]  They didn't even have a Constitution.
[01:17:57.661 --> 01:17:58.241]  They used God's Word.
[01:17:58.241 --> 01:17:58.641]  That's right.
[01:17:58.641 --> 01:18:01.562]  The whole Bible is about resisting tyranny.
[01:18:01.562 --> 01:18:01.882]  That's right.
[01:18:01.882 --> 01:18:07.344]  And it was called the Black Brigades, because back then preachers of all denominations wore black.
[01:18:07.344 --> 01:18:11.184]  And they were the first ones to stand up against it.
[01:18:11.184 --> 01:18:12.585]  No, it was actually preachers that led it.
[01:18:12.585 --> 01:18:15.806]  Now, that's why the government's moving to take over the churches.
[01:18:15.806 --> 01:18:20.427]  But go ahead and send that, and all pastors should send that to us who are getting these letters.
[01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:24.153]  And we'll get an article up about it in the near future.
[01:18:24.153 --> 01:18:26.756]  Can I share something with you?
[01:18:26.756 --> 01:18:29.038]  Sure, but I just want to explain something to you, sir, sir, sir.
[01:18:30.049 --> 01:18:40.019]  When the roaring lion of government comes up and roars, seeing who it may devour, seeing if we cower and fall down, you never signed the 501c3.
[01:18:40.019 --> 01:18:41.460]  You never waived your rights.
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.102]  You're a home church.
[01:18:43.102 --> 01:18:45.364]  So you're running around saying, what do I need legally?
[01:18:45.364 --> 01:18:52.351]  Because some scumbag in the government sends you a letter saying you've got to bow down and have no free speech?
[01:18:52.351 --> 01:18:53.452]  It's total bull!
[01:18:54.153 --> 01:18:57.155]  So I don't know who you sent it to to get advice from.
[01:18:57.155 --> 01:19:01.218]  Most of the big church groups are funded and controlled by the government, so they'll lie to you.
[01:19:01.218 --> 01:19:12.366]  But, I mean, if you haven't signed a 501c3, which you said may have been a mistake, what, I mean, you got some jackass telling you that it's a mistake, you gotta waive your rights and sign a contract with the government?
[01:19:12.366 --> 01:19:13.107]  No, no.
[01:19:13.107 --> 01:19:19.151]  I did, been doing research, and I found a Senate report, 93-549, where it talked about, where Lincoln
[01:19:23.112 --> 01:19:23.553]  I think?
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:52.142]  Yes, and they put it back into effect in 1933.
[01:19:52.142 --> 01:19:53.323]  We've been under martial law.
[01:19:53.323 --> 01:19:55.884]  They set up the state police who are really federal.
[01:19:55.884 --> 01:19:57.344]  We are a conquered nation.
[01:19:57.344 --> 01:19:58.485]  Are we going to get it back?
[01:19:58.485 --> 01:19:59.305]  Or are we slaves?
[01:20:00.799 --> 01:20:02.961]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[01:20:02.961 --> 01:20:10.107]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on Earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[01:20:10.107 --> 01:20:15.952]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anywhere.

[01:21:00.811 --> 01:21:07.474]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:07.474 --> 01:21:15.598]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:15.598 --> 01:21:21.180]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[01:21:21.505 --> 01:21:23.767]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:21:23.767 --> 01:21:28.851]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:34.075]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:34.075 --> 01:21:38.419]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:38.419 --> 01:21:39.520]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:44.023]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:21:48.914 --> 01:21:51.897]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:21:56.321 --> 01:22:06.470]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:13.477]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:22:14.039 --> 01:22:20.622]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:20.622 --> 01:22:22.603]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:22.603 --> 01:22:25.104]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:25.104 --> 01:22:36.029]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:36.664 --> 01:22:38.325]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.325 --> 01:22:40.186]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.186 --> 01:22:47.110]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:22:56.935 --> 01:22:58.136]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.054 --> 01:23:06.036]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[01:23:06.036 --> 01:23:06.796]  Think about that.
[01:23:06.796 --> 01:23:09.917]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[01:23:09.917 --> 01:23:13.117]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[01:23:13.117 --> 01:23:22.920]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables and antioxidants.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:23.660]  I'm good.
[01:23:42.426 --> 01:23:44.607]  Not rocks and shells.

[01:23:55.912 --> 01:24:01.614]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[01:24:01.614 --> 01:24:04.375]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:24:04.375 --> 01:24:08.237]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:11.459 --> 01:24:14.902]  We're going to be going to somewhere in Central Europe.
[01:24:14.902 --> 01:24:21.146]  He's on the road, Paul Darnanoo.
[01:24:21.146 --> 01:24:27.951]  Left Greece about 10 hours ago, or began leaving Greece.
[01:24:27.951 --> 01:24:28.972]  Going back to Romania.
[01:24:31.078 --> 01:24:34.000]  That is coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:45.970]  And then in the next hour, I'm going to fully detail Bill and Congress would ban gun ownership at will, how it ties into the Cyber Bullying Act, how we're all going to be on list, no jobs, no buying, no selling, no traveling.
[01:24:45.970 --> 01:24:47.771]  This is the global model.
[01:24:47.771 --> 01:24:54.877]  It doesn't just stop with Muslims or gun owners or conservatives or Green Party activists who are having their rights stripped secretly.
[01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:57.552]  This will go to everybody.
[01:24:57.552 --> 01:25:00.094]  This is tyranny.
[01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:02.756]  Let's go to Jason in Georgia.
[01:25:02.756 --> 01:25:04.658]  Jason, thanks for holding.
[01:25:04.658 --> 01:25:05.678]  Hey Alex.
[01:25:05.678 --> 01:25:06.739]  Hey.
[01:25:06.739 --> 01:25:08.301]  Look here, just a couple points.
[01:25:08.301 --> 01:25:18.068]  I voted for Chuck Ball in the last election and was just trying to get a shout out to him, say thanks for all the great work.
[01:25:18.068 --> 01:25:20.891]  Also, you woke me up right after 9-11.
[01:25:20.891 --> 01:25:24.073]  I've been listening to you since then.
[01:25:24.073 --> 01:25:25.234]  Man, what can I say?
[01:25:27.078 --> 01:25:27.659]  What the hell is
[01:25:44.821 --> 01:25:53.563]  You know, just trying to work all the time, make ends meet, the families are broken up, you know, the women are working so they can't take care of the kids, so the state's raising the kids.
[01:25:53.563 --> 01:26:00.444]  I mean, our enemies have taken their time doing this and setting this up and building power and wealth while they did it.
[01:26:00.444 --> 01:26:03.445]  You know, each phase of this, they profit from it.
[01:26:03.445 --> 01:26:09.026]  But now it's all coming to a head, and my God, folks, people think it's bad now?
[01:26:09.026 --> 01:26:10.366]  They haven't seen anything.
[01:26:10.984 --> 01:26:12.645]  Quick story about the mentality.
[01:26:12.645 --> 01:26:29.210]  Went on a fishing trip with some church guys, talking to the youth pastor, trying to get them to look at the building 7 collapse, you know, was on the Architects and Engineers website, and the guy just refused to look at it.
[01:26:29.210 --> 01:26:30.590]  Absolutely refused.
[01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:33.351]  Did he say it was of the devil or something?
[01:26:33.351 --> 01:26:36.552]  He couldn't believe that Americans would do that to Americans.
[01:26:37.492 --> 01:26:40.094]  But we'd kill 50 million plus babies.
[01:26:40.094 --> 01:26:40.834]  Absolutely.
[01:26:40.834 --> 01:26:47.479]  I mean, Obama actually supports... I heard Keyes talk about this years ago and looked it up.
[01:26:47.479 --> 01:26:52.882]  Back when Obama was first talking about running, Keyes, who's from Illinois, couldn't believe it.
[01:26:52.882 --> 01:26:53.563]  And it's true.
[01:26:53.563 --> 01:26:56.164]  Obama supports killing babies after they're born.
[01:26:56.164 --> 01:26:58.286]  Did you know that?
[01:26:58.286 --> 01:26:59.447]  I wouldn't doubt anything.
[01:26:59.447 --> 01:27:00.827]  Let me just... No, no, no.
[01:27:00.827 --> 01:27:04.590]  He believes that you should be able to kill it even if it's been born the first few days.
[01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:05.370]  One thing, Alex.
[01:27:06.431 --> 01:27:08.432]  Thanks for everything you do.
[01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:09.834]  I listen to you every day.
[01:27:09.834 --> 01:27:13.096]  I hate that your YouTube channel is down.
[01:27:13.096 --> 01:27:15.778]  Man, keep up the good work.
[01:27:15.778 --> 01:27:17.479]  We're here.
[01:27:17.479 --> 01:27:20.241]  I'm trying to wake people up.
[01:27:20.241 --> 01:27:22.102]  God bless you and your family.
[01:27:22.102 --> 01:27:23.363]  Look to Jesus.
[01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:24.904]  He'll help us through.
[01:27:24.904 --> 01:27:26.926]  Thank you very much.
[01:27:26.926 --> 01:27:27.646]  Absolutely.
[01:27:27.646 --> 01:27:33.511]  Ladies and gentlemen, all I know is
[01:27:35.598 --> 01:27:43.620]  That the big central banks that own Europe and the United States have used us as a base, a funding system to fund their world government.
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:44.700]  They don't need us anymore.
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:54.822]  Their world government's in place and they brag in all their publications how they're going to bankrupt us and destroy our liberties and freedoms and break us.
[01:27:54.822 --> 01:28:00.103]  And it's happening now and they control the liberals and conservatives of this nation
[01:28:01.434 --> 01:28:03.735]  And they've already stolen $14 trillion.
[01:28:03.735 --> 01:28:06.236]  I mean, the damage is already irrevocable.
[01:28:06.236 --> 01:28:12.679]  The only question is, will we at least through this crisis kick the globalists out, or will they use the crisis to get even more power?
[01:28:12.679 --> 01:28:14.459]  Rick in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:28:14.459 --> 01:28:20.542]  Alright, let's go to Bold and Mass.
[01:28:20.542 --> 01:28:23.603]  Bold and Mass, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:28:23.603 --> 01:28:24.884]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:28:25.874 --> 01:28:32.339]  I'm just observing based on the guests you've had, particularly Chuck Baldwin and it's getting very serious article.
[01:28:32.339 --> 01:28:38.665]  We seem to be going through a phase where we continue with the info war and it's not going to go hot suddenly.
[01:28:38.665 --> 01:28:42.388]  They'll continue to try the slow boil, coming for the guns now.
[01:28:42.388 --> 01:28:44.389]  But people can see what's going on.
[01:28:44.389 --> 01:28:46.611]  You're getting the word out, reporting to them.
[01:28:46.611 --> 01:28:50.254]  They have to take action and actually hide those guns.
[01:28:50.254 --> 01:28:51.936]  They can't say, oh that's what should be done.
[01:28:51.936 --> 01:28:53.557]  It's time to take action and do that.
[01:28:53.557 --> 01:28:54.618]  I mean people have to
[01:28:55.279 --> 01:28:55.820]  Respond.
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:56.880]  Knowing something isn't enough.
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.001]  You have to take action.
[01:28:58.001 --> 01:28:58.742]  They've taken action.
[01:28:58.742 --> 01:29:00.484]  They're getting the word out.
[01:29:00.484 --> 01:29:01.444]  They're pumping you around.
[01:29:01.444 --> 01:29:02.685]  Well, you know, this always happened.
[01:29:02.685 --> 01:29:04.727]  It happened in Russia, China, Cuba.
[01:29:04.727 --> 01:29:07.149]  People can never believe it's really happening here.
[01:29:07.149 --> 01:29:08.931]  Folks, it happens everywhere.
[01:29:08.931 --> 01:29:10.792]  This is normal what's happening.
[01:29:10.792 --> 01:29:12.094]  It just isn't good.
[01:29:12.094 --> 01:29:14.596]  And I don't want my family to be slaves, man.
[01:29:14.596 --> 01:29:17.018]  You know, I'll tell you bold, I'm getting sick of it.
[01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:20.821]  The apple seed program is something to look for, for people can learn to shoot.
[01:29:20.821 --> 01:29:21.602]  They're buying the guns.
[01:29:21.602 --> 01:29:23.003]  They need to know how to use them.
[01:29:23.542 --> 01:29:25.003]  Uh, they need to continue to buy the ammo.
[01:29:25.003 --> 01:29:25.803]  That's a vote.
[01:29:25.803 --> 01:29:32.467]  Not that they were... Hey, Moe, do you see all these articles where they're arresting people for buying ammo when it's not even illegal?
[01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:33.447]  It's going to happen.
[01:29:33.447 --> 01:29:35.188]  It's kind of like Cool Hand Luke movie.
[01:29:35.188 --> 01:29:37.209]  He doesn't escape in the end.
[01:29:37.209 --> 01:29:39.190]  But he, right to the end, he fought.
[01:29:39.190 --> 01:29:40.591]  Resistance is victory.
[01:29:40.591 --> 01:29:41.692]  And we're waking up.
[01:29:41.692 --> 01:29:42.532]  People have left and right.
[01:29:42.532 --> 01:29:43.312]  We're not alone.
[01:29:43.312 --> 01:29:44.413]  We're the majority.
[01:29:44.413 --> 01:29:46.274]  People have to know that and continue to act.
[01:29:46.274 --> 01:29:47.174]  And let them arrest you.
[01:29:47.174 --> 01:29:47.735]  Don't fear.
[01:29:47.735 --> 01:29:48.795]  Don't overreact.
[01:29:48.795 --> 01:29:49.496]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:49.496 --> 01:29:49.956]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.087 --> 01:29:55.009]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.009 --> 01:30:01.173]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.173 --> 01:30:09.819]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:30:09.819 --> 01:30:14.662]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[01:30:14.662 --> 01:30:19.845]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[01:31:01.151 --> 01:31:06.393]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.174 --> 01:31:13.058]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:31:13.058 --> 01:31:19.563]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:19.563 --> 01:31:21.524]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:21.524 --> 01:31:23.986]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:31:23.986 --> 01:31:34.874]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:31:37.159 --> 01:31:38.840]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:40.702]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:40.702 --> 01:31:47.607]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:47.607 --> 01:31:55.874]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:55.874 --> 01:31:57.455]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:57.455 --> 01:31:58.636]  The people strike back.
[01:32:00.476 --> 01:32:03.921]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:32:03.921 --> 01:32:08.188]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:32:08.188 --> 01:32:16.140]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:16.840]  We're good to go!
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.201]  I think a parasitic dream will never return.
[01:33:08.690 --> 01:33:11.011]  Paul Dornanew, joining us from Europe.
[01:33:11.011 --> 01:33:14.712]  It was at Bilderberg 2009.
[01:33:14.712 --> 01:33:23.434]  He shot some of the great video of the secret police following a cameraman
[01:33:36.385 --> 01:33:42.690]  And reporters at the 2007 Bilderberg Group meeting in Istanbul, Turkey.
[01:33:42.690 --> 01:33:45.392]  He got detained, saw many others arrested.
[01:33:45.392 --> 01:33:48.714]  He'll give us the latest on what happened over the weekend.
[01:33:48.714 --> 01:33:52.057]  And tomorrow we're going to have Charlie Skelton on, who was detained again.
[01:33:53.683 --> 01:33:59.970]  Got in a physical altercation, got roughed up by these people, and was basically driven from the country, so that's coming up.
[01:33:59.970 --> 01:34:10.983]  Then next hour, I'm going to have Aaron Dykes in studio, David Gergen and others, Republicans as well, are involved in this AmeriCorps citizen army, and put up on screen
[01:34:11.784 --> 01:34:33.030]  The image of the uniform, it is a red and black, it's a red uniform trimmed in black with fascistic khaki brown shirts, and they're marching and doing military drills in this video, hundreds and hundreds of them, and they have tens of thousands nationwide, they want millions, and they say, this is our uniform, this is what we wear.
[01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:36.951]  And they admit it is with Homeland Security and they are spies.
[01:34:37.944 --> 01:34:38.605]  They admit
[01:34:53.146 --> 01:34:55.986]  The legislation that Rahm Emanuel swore to introduce.
[01:34:55.986 --> 01:34:58.827]  We have the video posted right there so you can see it.
[01:34:58.827 --> 01:35:03.448]  And this will allow them secretly to ban any gun ownership they want and then you can't challenge it.
[01:35:03.448 --> 01:35:04.208]  There's no court.
[01:35:04.208 --> 01:35:05.608]  You don't even know why you're on it.
[01:35:05.608 --> 01:35:09.029]  I mean, this is the hallmark, the bedrock of tyranny.
[01:35:09.029 --> 01:35:20.231]  So a detailed report on how that ties into the Cyber Bullying Act, restrict free speech, how it ties in to worldwide, how you'll have these tracking lists and not be able to travel, have a job, you name it, in the future.
[01:35:20.231 --> 01:35:22.211]  Before we go to Paul Dornanoom,
[01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:27.472]  Joining us, I don't know if he's gotten out of Greece yet, I know he started driving out today.
[01:35:27.472 --> 01:35:50.625]  Before we go back to, or go to our guest for the first time, I do want to take a few minutes out here as we start the simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv to just remind listeners that this radio show and the TV show and everything we do here is not inexpensive.
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:59.642]  And we're able to continue what we do and able to expand our key fight, the tip of the spear against the New World Order, who can deny we're at the tip of the spear, through your financial support.
[01:35:59.642 --> 01:36:09.584]  We're going to have a money bomb June 11th, and I would ask folks, we have, you know, once a year, this is the second annual money bomb, to expand the TV studios, to buy more cameras and computers.
[01:36:09.584 --> 01:36:11.564]  That sounds like a lot of money to try to raise $250,000.
[01:36:11.564 --> 01:36:16.165]  That is, that would be two cameras in a real studio.
[01:36:17.836 --> 01:36:25.442]  Okay, well we're talking about three or four cameras, a whole studio, more space, the equipment, one or two employees for the year.
[01:36:25.442 --> 01:36:34.068]  We need this money, so if you want to go ahead and donate at InfoWars.com, there's big banners to the money bomb, and we haven't added the new donations the last week.
[01:36:34.068 --> 01:36:35.309]  We'll do that.
[01:36:35.309 --> 01:36:40.873]  It's over $15,000 just a few days into it, and then we're going to try to really have a lot of giving on the day of June 11th.
[01:36:43.127 --> 01:36:51.431]  And so that's coming up June 11th, but please check out InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or link through the banner at InfoWars.com today.
[01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:58.615]  Also, PrisonPlanet.tv members out there, you make this show possible.
[01:36:58.615 --> 01:37:04.678]  You make the simulcast, the TV production possible, the crew in there, and what we do.
[01:37:04.678 --> 01:37:07.259]  And you get all of my films in super high quality.
[01:37:07.259 --> 01:37:12.202]  We're going to release this presentation with Aaron Russo's last video interview that we did.
[01:37:13.581 --> 01:37:25.975]  And it has some added parts, the interview never before seen, and some behind-the-scenes interviews we did with him in a restaurant we went to, and also I update the presentation with the latest video and information.
[01:37:27.305 --> 01:37:27.646]  I think?
[01:37:45.447 --> 01:37:49.810]  And we'll have it by next week and have the orders packed up and ready to ship June 3rd.
[01:37:49.810 --> 01:37:51.911]  So get your orders in for that today.
[01:37:51.911 --> 01:37:55.033]  Again, Reflections and Warnings, an interview with Aaron Russo.
[01:37:55.033 --> 01:37:57.695]  Also, we have a new DVD arsenal.
[01:37:57.695 --> 01:38:08.983]  Every month we take the best in-studio and other interviews and other extras and things we've done, like we're working on one right now that has all the Tent City interviews and things in it.
[01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:10.504]  And we've sent crews out to cover that.
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:12.861]  That's boiled down.
[01:38:12.861 --> 01:38:21.888]  The first in those monthly DVD Arsenal videos has been released, and that can also be ordered at thesecureshoppingcard.infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:38:21.888 --> 01:38:21.968]  888-253-3139.
[01:38:21.968 --> 01:38:23.469]  Then we have our big productions.
[01:38:23.469 --> 01:38:25.631]  We have our big productions that we do.
[01:38:39.331 --> 01:38:45.592]  Like Endgame, Terror Storm, Fabled Enemies, Truth Rising, and the newest one, The Obama Deception.
[01:38:45.592 --> 01:38:50.753]  The Obama Deception needs to be seen on high quality DVD and with the extras and things that are on it.
[01:38:50.753 --> 01:38:53.974]  So please order that at InfoWars.com.
[01:38:53.974 --> 01:38:56.214]  And that's how you support this radio show and everything we do.
[01:38:56.214 --> 01:38:59.375]  Plus, you get a tool that will wake up conservatives and liberals.
[01:38:59.375 --> 01:39:02.455]  Liberals will watch it because they want to see how Obama's being criticized.
[01:39:02.455 --> 01:39:05.336]  Conservatives will watch it because they hate Obama and they'll see that it's really
[01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:13.471]  On attack on neocons and on fake liberals, controlled by the offshore power structure, and it covers the Bilderberg Group and what's really happening.
[01:39:13.471 --> 01:39:16.953]  So, such an essential film, The Obama Deception.
[01:39:16.953 --> 01:39:29.960]  Okay, that said, let's go to Paul Dornanew, who again, did work for us on the film Endgame, and he has pretty good English, better English than I have Romanian.
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:36.566]  And he again, this is his second Bilderberg that he's traveled to, and we really appreciate his courage.
[01:39:36.566 --> 01:39:40.410]  This year, it was reported by Jim Tucker, the worst security ever.
[01:39:40.410 --> 01:39:45.875]  Two and a half miles away, they were arresting people, detaining people.
[01:39:45.875 --> 01:39:47.517]  Secret police following everybody.
[01:39:47.517 --> 01:39:48.778]  Tucker said it was the worst he ever saw.
[01:39:49.781 --> 01:39:57.005]  Also, Charlie Skelton of The Guardian got arrested twice, detained another time, got roughed up by security.
[01:39:57.005 --> 01:39:59.287]  That's now headlines, The London Guardian.
[01:39:59.287 --> 01:40:01.068]  And he went there like this was all a big joke.
[01:40:01.068 --> 01:40:02.609]  But it's not a big joke now.
[01:40:02.609 --> 01:40:04.370]  He kind of had an awakening.
[01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:07.031]  And then, so we'll be going over that.
[01:40:07.031 --> 01:40:09.893]  Mr. Dornanoo, thank you for joining us.
[01:40:09.893 --> 01:40:11.214]  Hello, Alex.
[01:40:11.214 --> 01:40:11.894]  Good to have you on.
[01:40:11.894 --> 01:40:14.416]  Where are you now on the road?
[01:40:15.895 --> 01:40:17.516]  Actually, I'm at my home.
[01:40:17.516 --> 01:40:19.477]  I arrived this morning.
[01:40:19.477 --> 01:40:22.698]  It was a straight drive.
[01:40:22.698 --> 01:40:24.119]  So you're not that far from Greece.
[01:40:24.119 --> 01:40:28.521]  How long did it take you to get back to where you're from in Romania?
[01:40:28.521 --> 01:40:30.622]  About 15 hours.
[01:40:30.622 --> 01:40:32.843]  Okay.
[01:40:32.843 --> 01:40:34.544]  Okay, we'll start at the beginning.
[01:40:34.544 --> 01:40:37.205]  I'm going to try to just sit back and have you break it down.
[01:40:37.205 --> 01:40:38.606]  What did you see?
[01:40:38.606 --> 01:40:39.466]  When did you arrive?
[01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:40.526]  What did you witness?
[01:40:40.526 --> 01:40:41.247]  What happened to you?
[01:40:42.591 --> 01:40:51.194]  Well, I arrived there for the evening with a friend of mine to help me with the footage.
[01:40:51.194 --> 01:40:52.934]  His name is Florian.
[01:40:52.934 --> 01:40:54.535]  Last name is Terbu.
[01:40:54.535 --> 01:41:05.138]  And basically what we noticed there from the beginning, and I have to agree completely with Jim Tucker, is that the security was
[01:41:06.641 --> 01:41:15.246]  Worse than I've seen in 2007 in Istanbul and what I've seen other times from other reports.
[01:41:15.246 --> 01:41:25.232]  Basically the police, I think the police took the job to secure the place and the army, the Greek army.
[01:41:25.232 --> 01:41:33.637]  I don't, haven't seen very much of special forces like I've seen before from maybe US military or something like that.
[01:41:34.164 --> 01:41:55.249]  But, uh, from the pictures I took, uh, I could, um, be able to observe, um, for example, military on, uh, fast boats, uh, with guns, heavy guns, uh, uh, Greek, uh, military navy on the sea that was patrolling around the hotel, uh, police helicopter from surveilling the area.
[01:41:55.249 --> 01:42:01.971]  When we arrived, uh, basically it was, uh, very animated, uh, and, uh, police, uh,
[01:42:03.456 --> 01:42:09.078]  Cars, police, bikes were coming and going everywhere.
[01:42:09.078 --> 01:42:12.500]  The traffic was restricted.
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:20.243]  So we basically went ahead, man, to try to see what's going on.
[01:42:20.243 --> 01:42:25.445]  And that's when we observed the pictures of the helicopter.
[01:42:25.445 --> 01:42:31.688]  That was the first day and we didn't, you know, we later have seen a few limos
[01:42:33.369 --> 01:42:39.853]  Black cars with black windows that were escorted by police.
[01:42:39.853 --> 01:42:41.054]  Was this last Wednesday?
[01:42:41.054 --> 01:42:44.496]  Thursday, actually.
[01:42:44.496 --> 01:42:47.478]  Okay, Thursday, so the first real day it kicks off.
[01:42:47.478 --> 01:42:50.020]  When did you start seeing them detain people?
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:55.183]  And then we heard there were some demonstrations that looked staged by the communists and the nationalists.
[01:42:55.183 --> 01:42:55.764]  Please continue.
[01:42:56.823 --> 01:43:21.328]  Well, my second day there, which is Friday the 15th, I was walking on the road, walking towards the Esquire Palace Hotel, and I met this guy, this Greek guy, I quote his name, and he told us, guys, you know, that they are arresting people with cameras.
[01:43:21.877 --> 01:43:26.161]  And I said, well, I haven't heard that before.
[01:43:26.161 --> 01:43:34.608]  So we took a walk and we managed to take a picture of the hotel where two people were sitting in the balcony.
[01:43:34.608 --> 01:43:43.555]  And I went to change the lenses and get a bigger lens, a zoom lens, to get a closer picture with them.
[01:43:43.555 --> 01:43:45.077]  And as soon as I put my
[01:43:46.215 --> 01:43:55.398]  Now they advertise, Paul, and then we'll continue with the story, they advertise Greece as if it's part of the European Union, it's supposedly free,
[01:44:15.427 --> 01:44:26.595]  But clearly Bilderberg gave the order to stop any photos because they're tired of us showing the Queen of the Netherlands and David Rockefeller and British royalty and others being there.
[01:44:26.595 --> 01:44:30.618]  So, I mean, clearly this sounds like Soviet Russia during the 1980s.
[01:44:30.618 --> 01:44:32.239]  Please continue.
[01:44:32.239 --> 01:44:33.300]  Exactly.
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:41.686]  Well, I even spoke personally to some of the cops in civilian or regular cops.
[01:44:42.250 --> 01:44:50.754]  And basically, what they told us is that, first of all, they were very friendly to us.
[01:44:50.754 --> 01:44:56.977]  Only some security people there were very, very angry and they were giving orders.
[01:44:56.977 --> 01:45:01.139]  They had stations, radio stations, all of them, and they were
[01:45:04.483 --> 01:45:15.596]  Oh, so you saw private security people, or what looked like plain clothes, private security men telling the police to be rougher with you?
[01:45:16.892 --> 01:45:18.472]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:45:18.472 --> 01:45:35.256]  Even when Richard Trabing from Ireland was arrested, basically he took a picture of such a man, and then that man ordered the police to get him.
[01:45:35.256 --> 01:45:38.257]  Okay, so clearly the Bilderberg security then
[01:45:38.937 --> 01:45:51.341]  Was giving orders to the police, and that's what we've heard from everybody, that the police didn't really like violating the press's rights, but were clearly under orders from higher up to do this.
[01:45:51.341 --> 01:45:59.724]  And so, go back over to the gentleman from Ireland, because we're going to be doing a story on this, Mr. Dornanoo, as you know, for PrisonPlanet.com, which has been the global leader.
[01:45:59.724 --> 01:46:04.546]  If you click under Google News, we're getting more hits right now on The Guardian and The New York Times.
[01:46:05.126 --> 01:46:08.707]  And others that have been in the Wall Street Journal that have been reporting on this.
[01:46:08.707 --> 01:46:10.948]  So it's important to get all the facts.
[01:46:10.948 --> 01:46:21.051]  So specifically, you're confirming Bilderberg was ordering people have their videotapes, their photos stolen.
[01:46:21.051 --> 01:46:30.614]  That allows civil action now against the private Bilderberg group based out of a private corporate office in the Netherlands.
[01:46:30.614 --> 01:46:31.474]  So please continue.
[01:46:32.501 --> 01:46:33.462]  Exactly.
[01:46:33.462 --> 01:46:37.685]  Well, I myself was detained two times.
[01:46:37.685 --> 01:46:40.628]  Actually, the second time was worse than the first time.
[01:46:40.628 --> 01:46:48.894]  The first time we got detained, me and my friend and that Greek guy, we were detained for about an hour.
[01:46:48.894 --> 01:46:55.419]  During that time, they probably brought some checks on us at the police station and then let us free.
[01:46:55.419 --> 01:46:59.903]  They didn't check our cameras or whatever we recorded.
[01:47:00.518 --> 01:47:26.494]  Now the second time was worse because it was yesterday when Bilderbergers started to leave and my friends started taking pictures with limos and basically they were all together in that park near the police barricade and they were friendly with us and
[01:47:28.203 --> 01:47:33.453]  Suddenly, it seems that this police guy dressed like a normal people.
[01:47:39.107 --> 01:47:39.988]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:47:39.988 --> 01:47:45.072]  Let's be specific, Mr. Darnit, because I want to get this right.
[01:47:45.072 --> 01:47:51.456]  You're saying the officers were being friendly to you, and then he got irritated when he got the radio call.
[01:47:51.456 --> 01:47:54.699]  Was he irritated with you, or irritated that they were ordering him to arrest you?
[01:48:09.170 --> 01:48:13.392]  The reason is that they get the warrant to arrest us.
[01:48:13.392 --> 01:48:15.772]  So they didn't want to arrest you?
[01:48:15.772 --> 01:48:16.473]  Exactly.
[01:48:16.473 --> 01:48:17.213]  Now let's be clear.
[01:48:17.213 --> 01:48:20.734]  The cops, when they falsely arrest you, always call it detaining.
[01:48:20.734 --> 01:48:25.916]  When you're stuck in a police car and taken, you were arrested without charge.
[01:48:25.916 --> 01:48:29.978]  You were arrested, falsely arrested, and then released without charge.
[01:48:29.978 --> 01:48:33.519]  So that's why they keep telling you, you were detained.
[01:48:33.519 --> 01:48:35.480]  Because they know what they've done is unlawful.
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:37.840]  And you have a claim against them.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:42.322]  And even if the cops don't like it, there were lots of Germans who didn't like blowing people's heads off, but they still did it.
[01:48:42.322 --> 01:48:49.044]  You know, there were lots of folks who didn't like, you know, having, you know, to hang black runaway slaves, but they still hung them.
[01:48:49.044 --> 01:48:55.326]  And just because you don't like, you know, oh, I had to rob a bank, I was real sad about it, I don't like it, but I have to rob it.
[01:48:55.326 --> 01:48:59.147]  Those police officers are not above the law.
[01:48:59.147 --> 01:48:59.307]  Now,
[01:49:00.942 --> 01:49:18.074]  More importantly, you and others that were arrested, including the Irishman and the Brit reporter for The Guardian, they need to file suit against the Bilderberg Group for soliciting your arrest.
[01:49:18.074 --> 01:49:20.376]  And then that will open all this up in court.
[01:49:20.376 --> 01:49:22.117]  We need to go after these bastards.
[01:49:22.117 --> 01:49:24.679]  Now, Mr. Dornan, please continue.
[01:49:24.679 --> 01:49:29.042]  Yes, I was considering doing such an action to help with
[01:49:30.157 --> 01:49:32.938]  The foreign minister in my country.
[01:49:32.938 --> 01:49:33.878]  Good.
[01:49:33.878 --> 01:49:39.159]  Asked them why I was detained or arrested at the time.
[01:49:39.159 --> 01:49:43.759]  Because the second time, well, I got released and I think that's what they wanted.
[01:49:43.759 --> 01:49:45.780]  Yeah, you were kidnapped, sir.
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:47.360]  You were in Shanghai.
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:48.220]  Four hours there.
[01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.201]  Four hours?
[01:49:50.201 --> 01:49:51.361]  Four hours there.
[01:49:51.361 --> 01:49:55.842]  Actually, we were in total of six people there.
[01:49:58.735 --> 01:50:02.020]  One guy hadn't had anything to do with us.
[01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:03.722]  He was an American from Colorado.
[01:50:04.344 --> 01:50:09.447]  And he was just sitting on the bank near us, and he was taken as well, even.
[01:50:09.447 --> 01:50:11.908]  Yeah, let's be clear, this is in the middle of a... No camera.
[01:50:11.908 --> 01:50:13.949]  Yeah, exactly, this is a no camera.
[01:50:13.949 --> 01:50:28.637]  This is in the middle of just a gorgeous tourist area, and they shut down the entire palace with three huge hotels, and then there's a huge bay with boats and ships and people on the beach with volleyballs, and they were just grabbing people.
[01:50:28.637 --> 01:50:29.598]  Explain that to people.
[01:50:31.394 --> 01:50:31.834]  Exactly.
[01:50:31.834 --> 01:50:40.577]  So, well, basically we're just standing there trying to take a picture with the cars that were passing by the limos for Billaburger.
[01:50:40.577 --> 01:50:44.899]  And they came to us and told us that we need to go to the police.
[01:50:44.899 --> 01:50:45.779]  Alright, stay there.
[01:50:45.779 --> 01:50:50.361]  But you're saying they also arrested just an American tourist who didn't have a camera?
[01:50:50.361 --> 01:50:50.981]  Exactly.
[01:50:50.981 --> 01:50:51.281]  Exactly.
[01:50:51.281 --> 01:50:53.742]  He was just guilty by association.
[01:50:53.742 --> 01:50:56.243]  He was just standing there with us.
[01:50:56.243 --> 01:50:57.364]  Paul Dornanews, stay there.
[01:50:57.364 --> 01:50:58.164]  Paul, stay there.
[01:50:58.164 --> 01:50:59.384]  We'll be right back to you.
[01:50:59.384 --> 01:51:00.545]  Key information straight ahead.
[01:51:01.331 --> 01:51:03.792]  Americans, do you know where your food comes from?
[01:51:03.792 --> 01:51:05.712]  Is it safe, secure, and healthy?
[01:51:05.712 --> 01:51:10.173]  Did you know most of our food is not contaminated with genetically modified ingredients?
[01:51:10.173 --> 01:51:19.176]  We at Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company have been helping people get pure garden seed for 12 years and carry over 1,200 varieties of GMO-free heirloom seed.

[01:51:58.314 --> 01:52:01.296]  That's rareseeds.com.
[01:52:01.296 --> 01:52:07.119]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.119 --> 01:52:14.103]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:52:14.699 --> 01:52:21.284]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:21.284 --> 01:52:23.266]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:23.266 --> 01:52:25.748]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:25.748 --> 01:52:37.337]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:37.337 --> 01:52:39.019]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.019 --> 01:52:40.380]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:40.862 --> 01:52:47.764]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:47.764 --> 01:52:56.026]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:56.026 --> 01:52:57.607]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.607 --> 01:52:58.787]  The people strike back.
[01:53:00.836 --> 01:53:02.157]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:02.157 --> 01:53:07.740]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:12.762]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:12.762 --> 01:53:18.345]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:53:18.345 --> 01:53:23.568]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:23.568 --> 01:53:25.429]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:53:25.871 --> 01:53:30.675]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:53:30.675 --> 01:53:31.796]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:31.796 --> 01:53:34.838]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:53:34.838 --> 01:53:38.481]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:53:38.481 --> 01:53:41.663]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:41.663 --> 01:53:43.885]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:43.885 --> 01:53:44.765]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:53:44.765 --> 01:53:44.986]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:44.986 --> 01:53:46.147]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:53:54.983 --> 01:53:57.524]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:57.524 --> 01:54:07.327]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:54:07.327 --> 01:54:12.328]  We have a big announcement concerning YouTube censorship.
[01:54:12.328 --> 01:54:15.689]  And I'll say this, it looks very, very positive, but I don't want to declare victory yet.
[01:54:15.689 --> 01:54:18.050]  So that'll probably be in the next few days.
[01:54:30.375 --> 01:54:32.135]  Up on screen, it's coming up next hour.
[01:54:32.135 --> 01:54:35.116]  We're going to play this video.
[01:54:35.116 --> 01:54:36.297]  That is AmeriCorps.
[01:54:36.297 --> 01:54:38.878]  That is one of the uniforms.
[01:54:38.878 --> 01:54:44.840]  They've got 10 different divisions of this, but that's the main political officer you're going to be seeing on the streets.
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:45.800]  In fact, they're on the streets.
[01:54:46.997 --> 01:54:53.203]  And they're chanting and doing military marches, and she looks at the camera and says, this is what I wear, this is my uniform.
[01:54:53.203 --> 01:54:55.625]  Very chilling.
[01:54:55.625 --> 01:54:57.126]  And they mean business, folks.
[01:54:57.126 --> 01:54:58.027]  They mean business.
[01:54:58.027 --> 01:54:59.308]  It's really sick.
[01:54:59.308 --> 01:55:03.111]  People can laugh at it, but they can call in the police on you, you name it.
[01:55:03.111 --> 01:55:06.034]  This is the new America, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:06.034 --> 01:55:08.516]  Arm patches and everything.
[01:55:08.516 --> 01:55:13.961]  I can't believe our republic's falling this hard this fast, but we really are just a third world country.
[01:55:15.202 --> 01:55:19.726]  With some vestiges of freedom and liberty left, but that's all going to be overrun soon.
[01:55:19.726 --> 01:55:20.446]  God help us.
[01:55:20.446 --> 01:55:22.648]  And the yuppies are just going to roll over to it.
[01:55:22.648 --> 01:55:24.369]  They've had their fight sucked out.
[01:55:24.369 --> 01:55:25.930]  A lot of folks, though, aren't.
[01:55:25.930 --> 01:55:28.432]  And that's why it's going to be very nasty.
[01:55:28.432 --> 01:55:29.993]  Going back to Paul Dornanoob.
[01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:43.094]  Infocon.ro, I-N-F-O-C-O-N-DOT-R-O, done a lot of great work and you can see his footage in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement being followed by cars and police waiting out front and playing close, smoking cigarettes in alleys.
[01:55:43.094 --> 01:55:53.917]  Looks like something out of Indiana Jones or in the Temple of, or Raiders of the Lost Dark and going through bazaars and trying to hide while guys follow him so Tucker can meet some guy in an alley to tell him what's going on from Bilderberg.
[01:55:54.918 --> 01:55:57.841]  And a lot of that went on this year, too, and Tucker's going to be back soon.
[01:55:57.841 --> 01:55:59.563]  He's getting back tonight.
[01:55:59.563 --> 01:56:02.786]  We'll have him on the next few days for a full debriefing here on air.
[01:56:02.786 --> 01:56:13.937]  But Mr. Dornanoo, the British reporter, Mr. Skelton, really got freaked out when they were at his hotel, in his room, following him, grabbing on him in alleyways.
[01:56:13.937 --> 01:56:19.282]  The London Guardian, he certainly had a conversion from laughing at us to taking this pretty serious.
[01:56:20.876 --> 01:56:32.166]  Yes, I've managed to meet Charles Shelton and talk to him a bit and he indeed was looking very surprised because of what was happening.
[01:56:32.166 --> 01:56:40.534]  I don't think he was expecting for this to be happening and was taken by surprise.
[01:56:40.534 --> 01:56:43.656]  But let me tell you what happened the second arrest of us.
[01:56:44.973 --> 01:56:56.759]  Uh, when we got, uh, second time arrested without, uh, the word, uh, two guys from American Free Press, uh, Bernard and Peter, I don't know their last names, and, uh... By the way, this is an exclusive.
[01:56:56.759 --> 01:56:58.460]  This is an exclusive.
[01:56:58.460 --> 01:57:00.901]  Nobody else is reporting right now on this.
[01:57:00.901 --> 01:57:03.102]  We need Paul Watson or Curt Nemo to get this up.
[01:57:03.102 --> 01:57:04.503]  A bunch of people were arrested.
[01:57:04.503 --> 01:57:04.863]  Go ahead.
[01:57:04.863 --> 01:57:06.163]  Go ahead.
[01:57:06.163 --> 01:57:11.426]  Okay, so, uh, uh, basically, uh, when they, uh, started to, uh,
[01:57:12.185 --> 01:57:15.648]  They made you erase that, didn't they?
[01:57:15.648 --> 01:57:22.134]  Because you reported that to us in an email that I gave to Watson yesterday, that they erased a bunch of your tape and stuff.
[01:57:41.045 --> 01:57:46.827]  That one is still on my phone because I managed to remove the card from my phone.
[01:57:46.827 --> 01:57:49.127]  But they did erase some of your stuff, correct?
[01:57:49.127 --> 01:57:49.947]  Yes.
[01:57:49.947 --> 01:58:00.390]  When we got to the police station, the first thing, there was a captain which I managed to take his pictures at a demonstration a day earlier.
[01:58:04.824 --> 01:58:05.905]  Oh, stay there!
[01:58:05.905 --> 01:58:06.166]  Stay there.

[01:59:56.245 --> 02:00:05.612]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.612 --> 02:00:06.913]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.913 --> 02:00:08.674]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.674 --> 02:00:10.455]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.455 --> 02:00:12.016]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.016 --> 02:00:13.578]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.578 --> 02:00:17.761]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.761 --> 02:00:21.844]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:31.823]  Paul Dornanew is our guest from Infocon.ro joining us from Romania.
[02:00:31.823 --> 02:00:36.126]  Got back home in the last few hours.
[02:00:36.126 --> 02:00:38.207]  He was taken to the police station, arrested twice.
[02:00:38.207 --> 02:00:39.988]  The second time, very angry.
[02:00:39.988 --> 02:00:49.474]  They'd seen his YouTube videos that we posted that were actually carried by Google News as news and even posted on their front page.
[02:00:49.474 --> 02:00:51.395]  That's what automated computers can do.
[02:00:51.395 --> 02:00:55.198]  They can censor us with one hand and then elevate us with the other.
[02:00:55.198 --> 02:00:55.418]  But
[02:00:57.153 --> 02:01:01.974]  It is amazing what the alternative media can do, thanks to Paul Dornanews, Courage, and many others.
[02:01:01.974 --> 02:01:12.678]  Okay, Paul, so you're saying this police officer, officer of officers, were you saying he was a captain or a sergeant, threatens you over the fact that you'd put him on YouTube.
[02:01:12.678 --> 02:01:13.238]  Please continue.
[02:01:14.573 --> 02:01:27.472]  Uh, he was very angry that I put those videos on YouTube, especially the ones on which you can see the faces of the... Well, let's make them more angry.
[02:01:27.472 --> 02:01:28.674]  Let's make them more angry.
[02:01:28.674 --> 02:01:29.615]  Do you have his name?
[02:01:31.291 --> 02:01:38.773]  No, I don't have his name, but I have a picture of him on the day earlier, when the protest fell.
[02:01:38.773 --> 02:01:40.353]  Well, send us who this thug is.
[02:01:40.353 --> 02:01:42.134]  We want to put that in the article.
[02:01:42.134 --> 02:01:43.154]  So he threatened you.
[02:01:43.154 --> 02:01:45.334]  What did he say when he threatened you?
[02:01:45.334 --> 02:01:55.497]  Well, he kept asking me why I put this on the internet, why I have recorded that video in front of the police station, and I denied all the time that I
[02:01:56.761 --> 02:01:57.842]  Recorded that video.
[02:01:57.842 --> 02:02:01.865]  I just said that I only uploaded it to the YouTube.
[02:02:01.865 --> 02:02:03.566]  I got it from somebody else.
[02:02:03.566 --> 02:02:05.727]  I kept denying all the time.
[02:02:05.727 --> 02:02:20.978]  And, uh, and, uh, they said, well, uh, we have to, uh, uh, take you into jail and, uh, send you to a car court where a judge will, uh, will decide, uh, what we're going to do with you.
[02:02:22.785 --> 02:02:26.307]  And after that, they started to do a body search on us.
[02:02:26.307 --> 02:02:35.570]  They had to remove our shoes, got everything, whatever we had on us, taken away.
[02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:47.215]  And I feel that they were looking for something else, like maybe, you know, knife, fork, drugs, something to get us, to stage us.
[02:02:47.901 --> 02:02:51.344]  Probably, that's what they are looking for.
[02:02:51.344 --> 02:03:02.572]  And after that, they put the batteries back into the cameras and the tapes, and they had us show them what we filmed, what pictures we have taken of.
[02:03:07.081 --> 02:03:09.303]  How are you going to recover?
[02:03:09.303 --> 02:03:12.585]  Have you got some special software?
[02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:14.006]  Or had you saved it at the hotel?
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:42.504]  After, uh, to cover, uh, erase formats, uh, cards, I haven't wrote anything on it, so it can be done.
[02:03:42.504 --> 02:03:46.346]  Um, I'll try that tonight.
[02:03:46.346 --> 02:03:55.050]  But, uh, more important is that, uh, they had me also, uh, destroy the tape I had in my video camera.
[02:03:55.050 --> 02:04:00.553]  I had more than, uh, 40 minutes to put it on that tape, and they didn't want, uh, them to do it.
[02:04:00.553 --> 02:04:05.076]  They wanted me to do it by myself with my hands, and then, so I can do stuff fresh.
[02:04:08.615 --> 02:04:15.938]  So, that left for about four hours.
[02:04:15.938 --> 02:04:32.405]  Other two guys, two policemen, high in rank, I think, came to us and asked some questions about us, why we were taking pictures to the policemen, why we were taking pictures to the car, the car plate.
[02:04:32.907 --> 02:04:40.872]  That's what they started to say because they were looking at the pictures and saying, look, you took pictures with a car plate.
[02:04:40.872 --> 02:04:42.033]  Why do you do that?
[02:04:42.033 --> 02:04:47.277]  Yeah, implying you're a criminal so they morally can feel good about themselves, when really they're protecting criminals.
[02:04:47.277 --> 02:04:52.540]  Your alternative media, they're documenting world leaders, the bankers that have robbed us blind.
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:56.083]  Paul Dornanew, joining us from Romania, who just covered Bilderberg 2009.
[02:04:56.083 --> 02:04:56.403]  Stay there.
[02:04:56.403 --> 02:04:58.484]  A few more minutes with you, then I'm going to shift gears.
[02:04:58.484 --> 02:04:59.005]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.998 --> 02:05:02.679]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.679 --> 02:05:07.441]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:05:07.441 --> 02:05:10.402]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:13.444]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:05:13.444 --> 02:05:19.526]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:05:19.526 --> 02:05:22.748]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:05:22.748 --> 02:05:29.651]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:05:29.991 --> 02:05:33.013]  Do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:05:33.013 --> 02:05:38.176]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.

[02:05:48.042 --> 02:05:49.482]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:49.482 --> 02:05:50.183]  Take action today.
[02:05:50.183 --> 02:05:52.024]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:06:01.678 --> 02:06:07.487]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.487 --> 02:06:14.498]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:21.582]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:21.582 --> 02:06:23.623]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:23.623 --> 02:06:26.124]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:26.124 --> 02:06:37.087]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:06:37.691 --> 02:06:39.373]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.373 --> 02:06:41.235]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:41.235 --> 02:06:48.142]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:06:56.411 --> 02:06:57.992]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:57.992 --> 02:06:59.174]  The people strike back.
[02:07:01.132 --> 02:07:01.833]  You worry.
[02:07:01.833 --> 02:07:04.174]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[02:07:04.174 --> 02:07:04.714]  Hi.
[02:07:04.714 --> 02:07:07.496]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[02:07:07.496 --> 02:07:12.059]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[02:07:12.059 --> 02:07:14.521]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[02:07:14.521 --> 02:07:17.883]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[02:07:17.883 --> 02:07:19.805]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[02:07:19.805 --> 02:07:22.607]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[02:07:22.607 --> 02:07:26.329]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[02:07:26.329 --> 02:07:30.372]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[02:07:30.712 --> 02:07:34.813]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[02:07:34.813 --> 02:07:41.135]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[02:07:41.135 --> 02:07:43.496]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[02:07:43.496 --> 02:07:45.617]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[02:07:45.617 --> 02:07:50.258]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:07:50.258 --> 02:07:51.179]  Start now.
[02:07:51.179 --> 02:07:52.899]  Knowledge is power.
[02:07:52.899 --> 02:07:53.900]  Better take action.
[02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:54.860]  I think a storm's coming.
[02:08:01.674 --> 02:08:17.338]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.338 --> 02:08:23.379]  Okay, very important report coming up.
[02:08:23.379 --> 02:08:25.080]  In just a few minutes I'm going to detail
[02:08:26.732 --> 02:08:30.735]  The just off-the-chart attacks on liberty and freedom that are going on.
[02:08:30.735 --> 02:08:33.017]  Bills introduced to ban free speech.
[02:08:33.017 --> 02:08:36.640]  Bills introduced to ban guns at will, to ban gun owners.
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:40.002]  But how this ties into a bigger picture of control.
[02:08:40.002 --> 02:08:42.584]  These tracking and tracing lists.
[02:08:42.584 --> 02:08:46.588]  For travel, for buying, for selling, for having jobs, that's coming up.
[02:08:46.588 --> 02:08:49.310]  But right now let's go back to Paul Dornanew of Infocon.com.
[02:08:50.379 --> 02:08:54.721]  R-O, a citizen activist, citizen news gatherer, took action.
[02:08:54.721 --> 02:08:58.642]  A lot of his footage is in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:08:58.642 --> 02:09:01.783]  He went to Bilderberg 2007.
[02:09:01.783 --> 02:09:05.924]  And 2008 was in Chantilly, Virginia.
[02:09:05.924 --> 02:09:15.347]  We were bullhorning them from less than 50 yards away, their main conference hall, because most of the conference hall, the facility was 100, 200, 300 yards away from the road.
[02:09:15.347 --> 02:09:19.209]  But the one area where the conference room backed up on a side road,
[02:09:19.949 --> 02:09:26.334]  Public sidewalk, you were like 35 yards away and Richard N. Haas came out and was angry, the head of the CFR.
[02:09:26.334 --> 02:09:29.737]  I mean, the security was just breathing heavy.
[02:09:29.737 --> 02:09:38.925]  They had Secret Service just literally just going, looking at us with hatred because they told them, don't arrest these people because it'll end up being, you know, news coverage.
[02:09:38.925 --> 02:09:40.827]  Because it was a total blackout in the U.S.
[02:09:40.827 --> 02:09:42.508]  Well, they've changed the rules 2009.
[02:09:44.537 --> 02:09:46.440]  Now they did have me arrested when I went to Canada.
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.383]  They pulled me off and said, what are you coming to do at the conference?
[02:09:48.383 --> 02:09:49.805]  Are you planning violence?
[02:09:49.805 --> 02:09:50.987]  And I said, no, I'm a nonviolent guy.
[02:09:50.987 --> 02:09:51.527]  Everybody knows that.
[02:09:51.527 --> 02:09:54.011]  I'm here to cover the world elite.
[02:09:54.011 --> 02:09:56.134]  And they said, oh, no, you're not.
[02:09:56.134 --> 02:09:58.237]  You're trying to bring porn into Canada.
[02:09:58.237 --> 02:09:59.319]  And I said, excuse me?
[02:10:00.185 --> 02:10:03.486]  They said, yep, we find one thing on your computer, a pinup girl.
[02:10:03.486 --> 02:10:04.646]  You're going to prison.
[02:10:04.646 --> 02:10:07.627]  And they would smile and laugh and strut around in black uniforms.
[02:10:07.627 --> 02:10:12.549]  They were like these black vests, armored vests over gray, and they would get off on it.
[02:10:12.549 --> 02:10:15.130]  I was like, you're actually getting off on this, aren't you?
[02:10:15.130 --> 02:10:16.250]  You're actually feeding right now.
[02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:17.130]  They would get so mad.
[02:10:17.130 --> 02:10:20.551]  I would go, man, it must be a pathetic job to be you.
[02:10:20.551 --> 02:10:22.092]  I kind of enjoyed it for a while.
[02:10:24.045 --> 02:10:25.066]  And they were so angry.
[02:10:25.066 --> 02:10:30.591]  I mean, they were so angry because they told us no cell phone calls and they took our cell phones and stuff.
[02:10:30.591 --> 02:10:34.594]  But Slick Eyes, no, it was Aaron Dykes had his little bitty cell phone.
[02:10:34.594 --> 02:10:36.976]  He's a little bitty gray cell phone.
[02:10:36.976 --> 02:10:40.199]  We actually lost it at Bilderberg 2009.
[02:10:40.199 --> 02:10:42.441]  I forgot about that.
[02:10:42.441 --> 02:10:43.642]  But that was a year later.
[02:10:45.373 --> 02:10:45.934]  I have a family.
[02:10:45.934 --> 02:10:47.975]  I have a daughter.
[02:11:08.377 --> 02:11:09.619]  And he's got a French accent.
[02:11:09.619 --> 02:11:12.322]  He's like, I don't want to lose my job.
[02:11:12.322 --> 02:11:16.027]  We have a deal that you're going to be nice about this.
[02:11:16.027 --> 02:11:16.347]  Aren't you?
[02:11:16.347 --> 02:11:20.713]  And I said, well, I'm going to talk about what happened, but you know, I just want to get out of here.
[02:11:20.713 --> 02:11:22.215]  And I said, uh, but, um,
[02:11:24.141 --> 02:11:26.522]  And he goes, you promise not to talk to the press about this?
[02:11:26.522 --> 02:11:28.764]  Which was immoral, what he was doing, so I just lied.
[02:11:28.764 --> 02:11:42.753]  I mean, in an emergency situation, when I'm with feds in a foreign country, telling me that I don't have a free speech and I promise to shut up, oh yes, oh I promise I'm not going to talk about this.
[02:11:42.753 --> 02:11:45.394]  As soon as I was out of Canada, I did though.
[02:11:45.394 --> 02:11:47.796]  I mean, because this is warfare, folks.
[02:11:49.029 --> 02:11:55.650]  Uh, you know, when you're behind bars and they're asking you to promise to waive your rights, I, uh, but I knew he was going to release me anyways.
[02:11:55.650 --> 02:12:03.472]  I mean, I didn't want him to taser me to death or do the other stuff that, uh, Canadian Customs is well known for murdering people in full view of cameras.
[02:12:03.472 --> 02:12:04.112]  I'm not kidding.
[02:12:04.112 --> 02:12:07.313]  So I, um, I told him, oh yes, I promise.
[02:12:07.313 --> 02:12:14.834]  One of the few times I lie, I'm pretty much trained to never lie, but I guess in the Bible, you know, when they, uh, have the spies going into the city,
[02:12:16.084 --> 02:12:16.845]  Was that with Gideon?
[02:12:16.845 --> 02:12:17.725]  What story was that?
[02:12:17.725 --> 02:12:25.330]  And they had the, you know, ladies in the... It was actually the prostitutes and they reported, you know, that, you know, they lied.
[02:12:25.330 --> 02:12:30.694]  I mean, I guess if I was like a Nazi Germany and they came and they said, are you Jewish?
[02:12:30.694 --> 02:12:32.015]  And I was Jewish.
[02:12:32.015 --> 02:12:33.616]  Then I would say, no, I'm not Jewish.
[02:12:33.616 --> 02:12:35.337]  And I guess I'd go to hell for that.
[02:12:35.337 --> 02:12:36.538]  But whatever.
[02:12:36.538 --> 02:12:38.639]  Let's go back to Paul Dornanew.
[02:12:39.540 --> 02:12:42.761]  Paul, you are on the air, sir.
[02:12:42.761 --> 02:12:44.881]  Anything else you want to add about how this went?
[02:12:44.881 --> 02:12:47.422]  So they're threatening you, they said they were going to bring you before a judge.
[02:12:47.422 --> 02:12:48.562]  What happened after that?
[02:12:48.562 --> 02:12:50.643]  What about being followed, secret police?
[02:12:50.643 --> 02:12:51.863]  What did you witness on that front?
[02:12:51.863 --> 02:12:54.644]  What happened to the Irish guy that got arrested?
[02:12:54.644 --> 02:12:56.905]  Anything else you haven't covered?
[02:12:56.905 --> 02:13:00.786]  Well, there are lots of things to be said still.
[02:13:00.786 --> 02:13:08.728]  Like, for example, there were other police officers higher in rank who came to us and interrogated us, asking questions, one of them.
[02:13:09.275 --> 02:13:14.077]  He was asking me directly if I'm stupid and if he's stupid.
[02:13:14.077 --> 02:13:18.358]  He looks like a stupid.
[02:13:18.358 --> 02:13:24.840]  And he kept asking me if it's legal in my country to take pictures of cops.
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:31.663]  And I said yes, it's legal to take pictures of cops in my country, Romania, even with hidden cameras.
[02:13:31.663 --> 02:13:35.864]  Because that's why they were so obsessed.
[02:13:35.864 --> 02:13:36.445]  So in the end,
[02:13:38.407 --> 02:13:41.230]  Another more security guy came again.
[02:13:41.230 --> 02:13:45.294]  He asked questions again.
[02:13:52.938 --> 02:14:04.147]  That they've got cameras surveilling us, they watch us, they listen to us without warrants illegally, and then they're out guarding criminals at the side of a beach resort and you're not supposed to show them?
[02:14:04.147 --> 02:14:06.568]  And the cops do that here too, they say, don't tape me.
[02:14:06.568 --> 02:14:09.291]  You're not God, you're not above the law.
[02:14:09.291 --> 02:14:15.736]  And don't you police understand it's the Bill of Rights and Constitution protecting your wealth, your name, your family's future.
[02:14:15.736 --> 02:14:19.919]  Don't you guys get off your little thumb-suckin', feelin' sorry for yourself power trips.
[02:14:20.419 --> 02:14:22.800]  So now, more high-level guys come.
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:25.480]  What happens next?
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:33.123]  Okay, so basically we were, after four hours, we were released by the rest of the union.
[02:14:33.123 --> 02:14:41.845]  But I think it was the security guy, I don't know, something like that, security staff or something like that.
[02:14:42.430 --> 02:14:51.060]  And, uh, when we left, we noticed that much of the police went away, so we realized the park was over.
[02:14:51.060 --> 02:14:53.963]  Most of the billboards have left already.
[02:14:53.963 --> 02:14:58.728]  So they detained us not to be able to take pictures of the cars leaving.
[02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:05.082]  And I think the most important thing you've talked about here is that your free speech was violated.
[02:15:05.082 --> 02:15:09.584]  European Union laws were violated, but we know they're written to do that.
[02:15:09.584 --> 02:15:15.466]  And they were doing this under orders of Bilderberg security, which you witnessed.
[02:15:15.466 --> 02:15:19.227]  And there was also Navy and Marines there, according to the mainstream news.
[02:15:19.227 --> 02:15:23.249]  Navy and Marines, and reportedly Army.
[02:15:23.249 --> 02:15:26.330]  So this is a big deal, and we appreciate your courage.
[02:15:27.718 --> 02:15:47.152]  I managed to take lots of pictures with, actually I put them on a website where I gave you the link, with security on the sea, navy ships, special forces, and others with big guns on the sea.
[02:15:47.152 --> 02:15:53.517]  There's very good footage I took from the boat we went on Saturday.
[02:15:57.557 --> 02:16:01.138]  Paul Norton, anything else you'd like to add from Romania?
[02:16:01.138 --> 02:16:03.859]  Well, I don't know.
[02:16:03.859 --> 02:16:06.340]  I'll try to gather my thoughts because I'm very tired.
[02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:10.981]  I only slept half an hour since yesterday morning.
[02:16:10.981 --> 02:16:14.382]  And I still have things to do, like another month.
[02:16:15.069 --> 02:16:15.489]  We'll see.
[02:16:15.489 --> 02:16:19.151]  You're doing your job, and you got inspired by other info warriors.
[02:16:34.198 --> 02:16:34.378]  I think?
[02:16:52.483 --> 02:16:54.405]  Thank you to Alex and hope to hear you soon.
[02:17:16.058 --> 02:17:28.906]  And we've got Paul Dornanoo created a YouTube channel and he's got some of the photos that he took.
[02:17:28.906 --> 02:17:30.207]  Looks like by the hundreds.
[02:17:30.207 --> 02:17:33.790]  He's created a slideshow that we're showing people right now on screen.
[02:17:33.790 --> 02:17:36.331]  Just a great guy.
[02:17:36.331 --> 02:17:43.116]  And yeah, it's now all over the Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, Russian, Dutch news.
[02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:45.710]  Greek news.
[02:17:45.710 --> 02:17:47.171]  Big papers in the UK.
[02:17:47.171 --> 02:17:49.933]  I've seen four big papers report on it.
[02:17:49.933 --> 02:17:52.836]  Nothing in the US but the Wall Street Journal and the AP.
[02:17:52.836 --> 02:17:54.637]  And the Wall Street Journal makes a big joke.
[02:17:54.637 --> 02:17:56.759]  Oh, big deal.
[02:17:56.759 --> 02:17:58.600]  So-called secret meeting, not so secret.
[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.582]  Some leaders are meeting, no big deal.
[02:18:02.227 --> 02:18:02.887]  Well, it's no big deal.
[02:18:02.887 --> 02:18:03.468]  Why did U.S.
[02:18:03.468 --> 02:18:05.588]  media say none of this existed for decades?
[02:18:05.588 --> 02:18:07.749]  Why did they say you were a crazy kook if you talked about it?
[02:18:07.749 --> 02:18:09.950]  Why are you arrested if you try to cover it?
[02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:17.873]  Why has Bilderberg Group's own minutes been released over the years where they are literally setting world policy with world leaders and telling them what to do?
[02:18:17.873 --> 02:18:19.374]  This is big news.
[02:18:19.374 --> 02:18:20.514]  This is important.
[02:18:20.514 --> 02:18:22.255]  And we are sick and tired of it.
[02:18:22.255 --> 02:18:28.818]  And we're tired of being harassed and death-threatened and everything else that we go through to bring people this information.
[02:18:30.066 --> 02:18:36.929]  So notice they act like it doesn't exist, and then when we do expose it, they go, okay, big deal, don't look at that, nobody cares, let's just move along.
[02:18:36.929 --> 02:18:57.698]  Oh, big deal, you showed some, in fact, that's what the, he's on the Trilateral Commission, that CNN reporter, the head of CNN International, you know, is running around, he got questioned by We Are Changed about it, he said, oh, big deal, just some old men meeting, it's nothing, nobody cares, and the Trilateral Commission runs nothing either.
[02:18:57.698 --> 02:18:59.379]  Meanwhile, he's one of their board members.
[02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:05.972]  So they deny it exists, and then when you finally point it out, they go, oh, it's nothing.
[02:19:05.972 --> 02:19:08.733]  And you go, well, here's your own documents that you're engaged in crime.
[02:19:08.733 --> 02:19:11.515]  Oh, well, police arrest him.
[02:19:11.515 --> 02:19:17.377]  You know, folks, these are the people that stole 14.8 trillion, more than 10 trillion from Europe and England.
[02:19:17.377 --> 02:19:18.198]  So total, that's
[02:19:19.018 --> 02:19:30.986]  24 plus trill in seven months and they're just getting started announcing and they're grabbing our car companies and handing over to foreign interest and saying GM will now be foreign cars brought into the U.S.
[02:19:30.986 --> 02:19:34.628]  and Chrysler's just going to go completely away.
[02:19:34.628 --> 02:19:44.435]  And then tax money, the bailouts that were given to them, 50-something million, that'll be used to relocate to Italy at Fiat and relocate GM to Brazil and China?
[02:19:47.861 --> 02:19:50.602]  Hey, cops serving all of this, what are you going to do when you lose your job?
[02:19:50.602 --> 02:19:51.282]  Well, you're not.
[02:19:51.282 --> 02:19:56.184]  You're going to live like third world cops and then be even more corrupt, taking kickbacks to live.
[02:19:56.184 --> 02:19:58.065]  We're going to be a third world cesspit.
[02:19:58.065 --> 02:19:59.085]  Good job, government.
[02:19:59.085 --> 02:20:01.326]  You sold out.

[02:21:39.358 --> 02:21:43.279]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.669 --> 02:22:13.554]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:22:13.554 --> 02:22:19.979]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:19.979 --> 02:22:22.021]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:22.021 --> 02:22:24.483]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:24.483 --> 02:22:35.372]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:22:37.674 --> 02:22:39.335]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.335 --> 02:22:41.196]  It's about a one world government.
[02:22:41.196 --> 02:22:48.099]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:22:48.099 --> 02:22:56.363]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:56.363 --> 02:22:57.944]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:57.944 --> 02:22:59.125]  The people strike back.
[02:23:00.843 --> 02:23:04.364]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[02:23:04.364 --> 02:23:06.265]  Now, going green can save money.
[02:23:06.265 --> 02:23:11.826]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[02:23:11.826 --> 02:23:19.849]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[02:23:19.849 --> 02:23:30.532]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[02:23:30.572 --> 02:23:30.952]  I think so.
[02:24:02.108 --> 02:24:07.931]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:07.931 --> 02:24:10.212]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:28.124 --> 02:24:31.746]  Monday through Friday from 11am.
[02:24:50.857 --> 02:24:51.598]  The 3 p.m.
[02:24:51.598 --> 02:24:53.659]  Central Standard Time.
[02:24:53.659 --> 02:24:55.079]  We are live here.
[02:24:55.079 --> 02:25:00.062]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:25:00.062 --> 02:25:09.847]  Got a big guest, one of the big Mac daddies of operating systems and cybersecurity, the history and future of the Internet, is joining us.
[02:25:09.847 --> 02:25:12.009]  You want to stay with us for that.
[02:25:12.009 --> 02:25:16.851]  I will take some of your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:25:16.851 --> 02:25:19.953]  Coming up as soon as I'm done playing these videos and going over this information.
[02:25:21.437 --> 02:25:29.442]  I think before I cover all the latest news and how it ties into this, it's better to just show you the video.
[02:25:29.442 --> 02:25:36.466]  Here is one of many videos out there of the Obama Brigade.
[02:25:36.466 --> 02:25:43.411]  You know, we showed people during Obama's campaign, people in camo chanting for Obama.
[02:25:43.411 --> 02:25:48.834]  And then we showed Obama saying he wants a military domestic security force and the fact that Republicans wanted it as well.
[02:25:48.834 --> 02:25:49.835]  It's bipartisan.
[02:25:50.765 --> 02:25:51.185]  We're good.
[02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:22.484]  And in the article written by Kurt Nemo, he links directly to City Year and other subdivisions of AmeriCorps and SecureCorps, where they state they're under Homeland Security to carry out Homeland Security duties, including intelligence gathering.
[02:26:22.484 --> 02:26:29.066]  So, what you're about to see are spies doing paramilitary training.
[02:26:29.066 --> 02:26:32.627]  And they then mix in Martin Luther King and Gandhi with it.
[02:26:32.627 --> 02:26:36.708]  Martin Luther King and Gandhi were fighting secret police and spies and fascism.
[02:26:38.063 --> 02:26:42.684]  But it puts a nice liberal, you know, drum circle angle on it.
[02:26:42.684 --> 02:26:44.665]  But the uniforms are decidedly fascist.
[02:26:44.665 --> 02:26:48.626]  Red with black trim, with brown khakis.
[02:26:48.626 --> 02:26:56.188]  This is... I mean, if I was making a science fiction movie about a dystopic nightmare future with thug, you know, citizen corps enforcers, this would be it.
[02:26:56.188 --> 02:26:57.128]  And it's called The Corps.
[02:26:58.391 --> 02:27:17.326]  So this is part of AmeriCorps, and it says on their site, Join the Corps, and their main system, and at first they have PR functions of helping old ladies and school kids, but the main function is what Rahm Emanuel said, military training three months every summer for the youth, junior high, high school, and out of school, paramilitary training with weapons.
[02:27:17.326 --> 02:27:20.388]  But don't believe me, just watch that screen.
[02:27:20.388 --> 02:27:20.789]  Here it is.
[02:27:38.446 --> 02:27:42.030]  They brought down the Berlin Wall.
[02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:06.945]  No, behind the Berlin Wall was citizen corps in tattletale uniforms spying on the citizens.
[02:28:06.945 --> 02:28:17.031]  So they wrap tyranny and spies and federally controlled local communities and federalization of police and the Boy Scouts training for gun confiscation.
[02:28:17.031 --> 02:28:19.113]  I mean, Insecure Corps, that division.
[02:28:20.023 --> 02:28:32.288]  I've got the Philadelphia News, seven years ago under Bush, training the high schoolers and middle schoolers for warrant service and fugitive apprehension, quote, with M16s.
[02:28:32.288 --> 02:28:37.109]  So, no, no, no, no, you'd be the people shooting the folks trying to get out of East Germany.
[02:28:37.109 --> 02:28:39.410]  Go back to the video.
[02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:44.672]  To make this world a better place, by helping those who need it most.
[02:28:44.672 --> 02:28:46.673]  To never turn my back when... Stop right there!
[02:28:48.030 --> 02:28:57.135]  Our government and the Democratic parties introduced bills that restrict free speech, that continue the free speech zones, that continue the Cyber Bullying Act, H.R.
[02:28:57.135 --> 02:29:04.480]  1966, that openly says if you hurt someone's feelings and they sign an affidavit, they will federally charge you under a felony.
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:09.263]  I mean, forget hate crimes laws where they punish some things more if they claim it was a protected group.
[02:29:09.263 --> 02:29:14.386]  This is saying that if you do something on the internet that somebody says hurt their feelings, federally charged.
[02:29:14.946 --> 02:29:19.008]  But then you show Tiananmen Square where people didn't have free speech.
[02:29:19.008 --> 02:29:21.248]  That was about free speech in Tiananmen Square.
[02:29:21.248 --> 02:29:24.350]  You show that when that's what you are!
[02:29:24.350 --> 02:29:33.113]  You camouflage yourselves in the color of liberty, in the flag of liberty, but then at the end you say, this is my uniform, this is what I wear.
[02:29:33.113 --> 02:29:34.173]  You guys are sick.
[02:29:34.173 --> 02:29:35.414]  So this is meant to suck in
[02:29:37.605 --> 02:29:39.206]  People who are just ignorant.
[02:29:39.206 --> 02:29:42.928]  I mean, my God, this is tyranny wrapping itself in liberty.
[02:29:42.928 --> 02:29:43.849]  And we will defeat you.
[02:29:43.849 --> 02:29:46.230]  We'll be right back with more of this disgusting video.
[02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:51.553]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.553 --> 02:29:52.954]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.954 --> 02:29:55.475]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.475 --> 02:30:01.639]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:01.726 --> 02:31:04.288]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:31:04.901 --> 02:31:07.527]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:07.527 --> 02:31:14.543]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:31:15.114 --> 02:31:21.696]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:21.696 --> 02:31:23.676]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:23.676 --> 02:31:26.157]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:31:26.157 --> 02:31:37.740]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:31:37.740 --> 02:31:39.421]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.421 --> 02:31:40.781]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:31:41.272 --> 02:31:48.179]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:31:56.448 --> 02:31:58.029]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.029 --> 02:31:59.231]  The people strike back.
[02:32:02.637 --> 02:32:03.758]  Spring is here.
[02:32:03.758 --> 02:32:04.738]  Growing season.
[02:32:04.738 --> 02:32:06.920]  The economy is not getting any better.
[02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:08.641]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:32:08.641 --> 02:32:09.602]  Think about it.
[02:32:09.602 --> 02:32:13.704]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:32:13.704 --> 02:32:17.387]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:32:17.387 --> 02:32:20.228]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[02:32:20.228 --> 02:32:32.096]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:32:32.416 --> 02:32:32.856]  We're good to go.
[02:33:10.174 --> 02:33:13.698]  Alright, let's go ahead and finish up with this.
[02:33:27.591 --> 02:33:29.092]  Cancer.
[02:33:29.092 --> 02:33:30.753]  America has cancer.
[02:33:30.753 --> 02:33:31.754]  It's metastasized.
[02:33:31.754 --> 02:33:33.094]  It's spread everywhere.
[02:33:33.094 --> 02:33:35.716]  The media is telling you the cancer is actually healthy.
[02:33:35.716 --> 02:33:43.361]  The public's pointing out all these tumors and things popping out, and the country's having trouble breathing, and they're saying, oh no, that's healthy.
[02:33:43.361 --> 02:33:45.142]  The rest of the body's what's bad.
[02:33:45.142 --> 02:33:47.063]  These tumors are the future.
[02:33:47.063 --> 02:33:50.105]  It's good to have folks running around in tattletale squads.
[02:33:50.105 --> 02:33:51.886]  And when you read about the Secure Corps,
[02:33:52.566 --> 02:33:56.627]  And one of its subgroups is set up by Clinton, now expanding city year.
[02:33:56.627 --> 02:33:58.307]  And David Gergen involved in the rest of them.
[02:33:58.307 --> 02:34:00.048]  It's bipartisan.
[02:34:00.048 --> 02:34:03.429]  You find out that it is Homeland Security roles.
[02:34:03.429 --> 02:34:08.890]  So I'm going to cover all that and dovetail it into the new world and what life under it will be like in a moment.
[02:34:08.890 --> 02:34:10.150]  But let's finish up with that video.
[02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:13.671]  Here it is.
[02:34:13.671 --> 02:34:17.372]  And to show that positive can always overpower negative.
[02:34:25.725 --> 02:34:29.190]  This is what I wear.
[02:34:34.517 --> 02:34:39.078]  Now that is designed for the most mindless fluoride head kid.
[02:34:39.078 --> 02:34:40.598]  Totally dumbed down.
[02:34:40.598 --> 02:34:41.278]  I am changed.
[02:34:41.278 --> 02:34:41.918]  Very simple.
[02:34:41.918 --> 02:34:42.858]  Very stupid.
[02:34:42.858 --> 02:34:45.339]  And this is what I wear because kids are all about what they wear.
[02:34:45.339 --> 02:34:47.239]  And look, I know how to zip a zipper.
[02:34:47.239 --> 02:34:56.361]  You know, I'm 14 and normally a four-year-old could do this, but the fluorides got me to the point where, and the mercury shots and the GMO food where I can zip a zipper.
[02:34:56.361 --> 02:34:56.561]  Zip!
[02:34:56.561 --> 02:34:58.041]  And everybody's like, ooh!
[02:34:58.041 --> 02:35:01.942]  And, you know, it's real popular with the drum circle and kind of what's, you know, cool.
[02:35:03.122 --> 02:35:03.422]  I don't know.
[02:35:24.737 --> 02:35:29.979]  But for also completely private groups, the Democratic Party, like usaservice.org.
[02:35:29.979 --> 02:35:31.999]  And then you're under their control, but it has the U.S.
[02:35:31.999 --> 02:35:33.640]  government seal on it.
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:41.022]  And it's literally, they're out doing gun buyback programs to condition everybody to turn their guns in, and to see the news images of that.
[02:35:41.022 --> 02:35:44.564]  They're busy, I mean, pushing so many facets of this.
[02:35:44.564 --> 02:35:48.645]  And then I covered last week the story out of the New York Times.
[02:35:50.359 --> 02:35:53.440]  Perhaps we can pull this article up for folks if we have time.
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:55.981]  Government readies youth corps to take on vets.
[02:35:55.981 --> 02:35:59.643]  Now, that's what the first paragraph of the New York Times said.
[02:35:59.643 --> 02:36:06.086]  That they're training them with these dummy MP5 BB guns and the rest of it with Homeland Security all over the nation.
[02:36:06.086 --> 02:36:07.186]  But that's only one program.
[02:36:07.186 --> 02:36:11.548]  Then they have other programs in 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th grade right on up.
[02:36:12.008 --> 02:36:16.529]  Where the public schools and Secure Corps do warrant service, fugitive apprehension.
[02:36:16.529 --> 02:36:21.370]  So see, it's not good for kids to have guns and paintball and play or do laser tag or whatever.
[02:36:21.370 --> 02:36:22.930]  The media says that's evil and bad.
[02:36:22.930 --> 02:36:25.291]  But if you do it under the government, it's okay.
[02:36:25.291 --> 02:36:28.451]  That's a sanctioned, kosher place to do this.
[02:36:28.451 --> 02:36:32.592]  So the kids run out and want to be part of this and it's under state control.
[02:36:32.592 --> 02:36:35.313]  And Hitler took the Boy Scouts that Germany had.
[02:36:36.053 --> 02:36:40.315]  And militarized it and turned it into the Hitlerjugend and said, you're going to spy, you're going to tattle.
[02:36:40.315 --> 02:36:46.058]  And we have public schools all over the nation, you know, writing dossiers on your parents, what's in the medicine cabinet.
[02:36:46.058 --> 02:37:00.605]  They have law enforcement semesters starting in the 6th grade, and then they have them again in the 8th and 9th grade where the kids have a federal deputized, deputized local county sheriff or police officer in the class teaching them.
[02:37:00.605 --> 02:37:05.268]  And now the economy is converting over where most of the new scholarships
[02:37:06.403 --> 02:37:13.246]  And grants aren't for electrical engineering or arts or botany or biology.
[02:37:13.246 --> 02:37:15.406]  It is now all about law enforcement.
[02:37:15.406 --> 02:37:17.707]  ITT Technical isn't ITT Technical.
[02:37:17.707 --> 02:37:20.889]  It's now ITT Law Enforcement or Security Guards.
[02:37:20.889 --> 02:37:22.209]  This is the new economy.
[02:37:22.209 --> 02:37:23.470]  They're converting it over.
[02:37:23.470 --> 02:37:34.434]  Because the big banks own all these private companies that supply the police and the military and Lockheed Martin puts in the face scanning cameras and the license plate reading cameras and Lockheed Martin and others put in the license plate readers and the
[02:37:35.234 --> 02:37:36.755]  Red light cameras.
[02:37:36.755 --> 02:37:38.615]  All of this they're making huge profits off of.
[02:37:38.615 --> 02:37:40.456]  They're converting our economy.
[02:37:40.456 --> 02:37:42.256]  Brain scanners at the airports.
[02:37:42.256 --> 02:37:44.977]  Biometric scanners that scan your naked body.
[02:37:44.977 --> 02:37:49.819]  Big defense contractors, if you read all over the country, putting cameras in school bathrooms.
[02:37:49.819 --> 02:37:52.180]  Cameras in the school lunchrooms.
[02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:55.301]  Cameras in the classrooms.
[02:37:55.301 --> 02:38:04.264]  Free federal computers where the kids do their English class stuff on a federal computer and a laptop they take home but they admit that that's downloaded by the feds to quote check for plagiarism.
[02:38:05.324 --> 02:38:16.428]  Because they run it against a database, but oh, also a database of what your kids are, and during the law enforcement class, it's on a computer, that goes to the feds, so now it's actual dossiers being written about your family.
[02:38:16.428 --> 02:38:25.071]  They admit this in the actual grants to the schools, but to the parents, they're told, oh, your child's being taught how to be a police officer, and you know, isn't this great, they're going to be like Jack Bauer.
[02:38:25.071 --> 02:38:26.672]  And then notice almost all the toys.
[02:38:27.642 --> 02:38:31.485]  Whole aisles at Target or Toys R Us are about kid spies.
[02:38:31.485 --> 02:38:32.586]  Get this, be a spy.
[02:38:32.586 --> 02:38:33.947]  Get that, be a spy.
[02:38:33.947 --> 02:38:38.310]  You watch the kid shows on TV, it's all about being spies and spy kids.
[02:38:38.310 --> 02:38:43.194]  Massive total conditioning everywhere, ladies and gentlemen, as they convert us to this.
[02:38:43.194 --> 02:38:47.758]  And then the New York Times reports, oh, isn't it great the little girls tell their mom not to take a bath.
[02:38:47.758 --> 02:38:49.339]  They tell their mom not to eat as much food.
[02:38:49.339 --> 02:38:50.320]  She's overweight.
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:52.001]  Her carbon footprint's too big.
[02:38:52.001 --> 02:38:55.864]  And then parents email me and call me and go, yeah, my kid came home and said, turn the sink off.
[02:38:55.864 --> 02:38:56.745]  You're using too much water.
[02:38:57.085 --> 02:38:58.485]  Our light bulbs are wrong.
[02:38:58.485 --> 02:39:07.428]  Sounds reasonable reason to have them be little spies of the states to these environmental parents, but then it can quickly be converted over into, what does mommy drink?
[02:39:07.428 --> 02:39:08.528]  What does mommy smoke?
[02:39:08.528 --> 02:39:09.469]  What does mommy say?
[02:39:09.469 --> 02:39:10.209]  What does mommy do?
[02:39:10.209 --> 02:39:12.430]  And now, that's happening!
[02:39:12.430 --> 02:39:20.232]  So, when you see this, these guys are being trained to take on vets, trained to take on gun owners, trained to take on the American people, and in Kurt Nimmo's article,
[02:39:21.593 --> 02:39:23.435]  Excellent article.
[02:39:23.435 --> 02:39:26.517]  AmeriCorps' paramilitary propaganda ad.
[02:39:26.517 --> 02:39:37.386]  In this story, he details, with links to the Homeland Defense Pentagon link, where they admit this is their main function as Homeland Surveillance and Intelligence.
[02:39:37.386 --> 02:39:39.908]  Well, what did Obama say in that speech?
[02:39:39.908 --> 02:39:41.830]  In fact, pull that up.
[02:39:41.830 --> 02:39:44.111]  It's in the Obama Deception.
[02:39:44.111 --> 02:39:45.893]  That's why the film's so important.
[02:39:45.893 --> 02:39:48.855]  But I just want to go over all this right now.
[02:39:49.836 --> 02:39:58.119]  If you go to it, you know, he says we needed a civilian intelligence agency just as big and strong as the military.
[02:39:58.119 --> 02:39:59.480]  Well, that's a million strong.
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:01.361]  Then I got corrected a few weeks ago in the L.A.
[02:40:01.361 --> 02:40:01.801]  Times.
[02:40:01.801 --> 02:40:05.282]  The congresswoman said, no, we want seven million.
[02:40:05.282 --> 02:40:05.942]  Seven.
[02:40:05.942 --> 02:40:07.143]  See, people think I exaggerate.
[02:40:07.143 --> 02:40:08.923]  I said one million because he said that.
[02:40:08.923 --> 02:40:09.764]  Seven million.
[02:40:10.664 --> 02:40:30.213]  And Kurt details in this article, AmeriCorps' paramilitary propaganda ad, also the Daily Newscaster detailed it, how this is to work with police departments, public safety grants, the war against terrorism on the home front, and they give them the training manuals that say, conservatives, gun owners, people that make frequent references to the U.S.
[02:40:30.213 --> 02:40:30.874]  Constitution.
[02:40:31.809 --> 02:40:34.350]  They need eyes and ears to do it.
[02:40:34.350 --> 02:40:41.594]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play Obama what he's saying they will be used for as they do military drills on TV.
[02:40:41.594 --> 02:40:42.354]  Here it is.
[02:40:42.354 --> 02:40:50.278]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[02:40:50.278 --> 02:40:57.302]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:40:58.740 --> 02:41:00.221]  Okay, that's enough.
[02:41:00.221 --> 02:41:02.941]  Now, let me go ahead and get into the other things that are happening.
[02:41:02.941 --> 02:41:05.142]  The text of H.R.
[02:41:05.142 --> 02:41:16.986]  1966, the Cyberbullying Act, racing through the House, openly states, word for word, that if you hurt someone's feelings, they sign an affidavit, federal felony, five years in prison, massive fines.
[02:41:16.986 --> 02:41:18.547]  You can go read it for yourself.
[02:41:18.547 --> 02:41:20.547]  Okay, then they have other bills introduced.
[02:41:20.547 --> 02:41:24.709]  This just came out this Sunday, BrokenInfoWars.com.
[02:41:24.709 --> 02:41:27.090]  We have a link to the No Fly, No Buy Act, H.R. 2401.
[02:41:30.285 --> 02:41:43.654]  Where they state openly to everyone that no judge, no jury, no arrest, no why you're on the list, just you're not allowed to buy guns and SWAT teams are coming to take them.
[02:41:43.654 --> 02:41:47.537]  Ladies and gentlemen, my dad's been on a no-fly list.
[02:41:47.537 --> 02:41:48.738]  And they say, no way to get off.
[02:41:48.738 --> 02:41:52.540]  You can write a letter here to some secret agency, we feel like you might get off of it.
[02:41:52.540 --> 02:41:56.303]  Because, you know, his name's very common.
[02:41:56.303 --> 02:41:58.644]  Airports, secures, bars,
[02:41:59.845 --> 02:42:00.625]  All or does it?
[02:42:22.310 --> 02:42:31.257]  I mean, my God, there was that famous case in 2012 when the Al-Qaeda tried to hit this or that because they had exploding cyanide chips that saved the children.
[02:42:31.257 --> 02:42:32.739]  You're not for killing children, are you?
[02:42:38.103 --> 02:42:40.004]  Taser bracelets when we get on planes?
[02:42:40.004 --> 02:42:41.785]  In fact, pull that up for folks!
[02:42:41.785 --> 02:42:48.350]  And then Homeland Security came on and said, yes, we're looking at making you wear taser bracelets right out of the running, man!
[02:42:48.350 --> 02:42:50.832]  Next, it's an exploding necklace around your neck.
[02:42:50.832 --> 02:42:56.595]  I mean, folks, it's so over-the-top, the public doesn't... They've introduced bills.
[02:42:56.595 --> 02:42:57.296]  Look at this one.
[02:42:57.296 --> 02:42:59.477]  Billing Congress would ban gun ownership at will.
[02:42:59.477 --> 02:43:00.718]  I'm going to cover that next.
[02:43:00.718 --> 02:43:03.800]  But first, Aaron Dykes did more research this weekend.
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:05.321]  You don't want to do a blurb about this.
[02:43:05.321 --> 02:43:07.483]  He tends to do the research and so busy he never gets to the articles.
[02:43:08.601 --> 02:43:16.788]  David Gergen is bipartisan, big Republicans, Trilateral Commission is involved with this city year division of Secure Corp.
[02:43:16.788 --> 02:43:20.771]  They hand out private grants so the fat cats make the money, but it's under federal control.
[02:43:20.771 --> 02:43:23.834]  This is the new fascistic model they call socialism.
[02:43:23.834 --> 02:43:28.318]  They mix in their recruitment videos with Mahatma Gandhi, who would fight against that.
[02:43:28.318 --> 02:43:32.882]  Not squads of tattletales in government uniforms.
[02:43:32.882 --> 02:43:36.745]  And so you're here to give us the inside scoop on this one division
[02:43:38.592 --> 02:43:41.254]  You know, they've got at least ten divisions of these people.
[02:43:41.254 --> 02:43:47.738]  They're going to have the elderly, you know, the Senior Corps, the EnviroCorps, the Green Corps, the Security Corps.
[02:43:47.738 --> 02:43:48.919]  That's what this is.
[02:43:48.919 --> 02:43:50.040]  It just goes on and on.
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:57.865]  The Infrastructure Corps, that's InfraGard with the 56,000 executives with license to kill their employees during emergencies.
[02:43:57.865 --> 02:43:59.326]  007 Power.
[02:43:59.326 --> 02:44:04.009]  I mean, Preachers, you know, the Clergy Response Team Corps.
[02:44:04.009 --> 02:44:05.450]  And it's all bipartisan.
[02:44:05.450 --> 02:44:06.890]  So, Aaron Dykes led us
[02:44:08.272 --> 02:44:11.214]  Break down the research you've done just on this one division.
[02:44:11.214 --> 02:44:12.455]  Yeah, I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:44:12.455 --> 02:44:21.604]  I think you probably remember around the time Obama deception was coming out, a lot of people were like, oh, is there really going to be some civilian national force service?
[02:44:21.604 --> 02:44:25.928]  And then it was all announced by the White House and all announced by the last two White Houses.
[02:44:25.928 --> 02:44:28.130]  And then they just people still live in denial.
[02:44:28.450 --> 02:44:31.911]  Yeah, people tried to deny it, and then Rahm Emanuel has a book on it.
[02:44:31.911 --> 02:44:32.831]  He's on TV about it.
[02:44:32.831 --> 02:44:36.171]  He gave like 20 speeches, C-SPAN, everywhere.
[02:44:36.171 --> 02:44:39.512]  Yeah, it turns out Brzezinski wrote about it in his book.
[02:44:39.512 --> 02:44:53.794]  And now David Gergen, back in 2007, helped launch America Forward, which is a collective of all these organizations, including City Year, and also Teachers.
[02:44:53.794 --> 02:44:56.815]  There's literally some 60-plus organizations.
[02:44:57.715 --> 02:44:59.475]  And he's just launched all of them.
[02:44:59.475 --> 02:45:05.696]  And by the way, if you nexus it in, last week, 50 plus top academics and NGOs came out and called for world government.
[02:45:05.696 --> 02:45:07.417]  It's all the same groups.
[02:45:07.417 --> 02:45:11.257]  And they all get government money to come in and take over your cities and counties.
[02:45:11.257 --> 02:45:15.338]  We had that British guy on about a month ago about the group over there doing the same thing.
[02:45:15.338 --> 02:45:16.678]  This is how they're taking over.
[02:45:16.678 --> 02:45:21.379]  And then they tell all the other churches, join us, we'll give you federal money to put out our propaganda.
[02:45:21.379 --> 02:45:25.260]  But if you don't join us, we're going to come and arrest you for tax evasion.
[02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:27.466]  I mean, this is tyranny, man!
[02:45:27.466 --> 02:45:28.149]  This is happening!
[02:45:28.735 --> 02:45:39.322]  Yeah, and, you know, who would figure the presidential advisor to, what, four or five presidents in a row is behind, you know, he's on the board for City Year and all these other organizations.
[02:45:39.322 --> 02:45:41.904]  Here's the list of all the organizations he's started.
[02:45:41.904 --> 02:45:45.786]  It's literally, this is the longer list, this is the shorter list.
[02:45:45.786 --> 02:45:48.268]  Colin Powell started one of these organizations.
[02:45:48.268 --> 02:45:49.529]  This is how they're going to rule.
[02:45:49.529 --> 02:45:55.593]  Every city, every county has its government funded, federally, internationally funded NGO.
[02:45:55.593 --> 02:45:57.894]  They only have standing at the UN or Congress.
[02:45:58.995 --> 02:46:00.596]  And they've got unlimited capital.
[02:46:00.596 --> 02:46:02.077]  They're moving against us.
[02:46:02.077 --> 02:46:02.478]  And you're right.
[02:46:02.478 --> 02:46:08.962]  Listen, you can go to an event and protest the North American Union or the SPP taking over the highways, which they claim we've beat, but they're still going ahead with it.
[02:46:08.962 --> 02:46:13.305]  And these people will walk up to you and start bumping you and start getting in your face and laughing.
[02:46:13.305 --> 02:46:19.930]  Imagine being scum for just 20 bucks an hour, 15 bucks an hour, who goes out and tries to destroy freedom.
[02:46:20.691 --> 02:46:21.471]  That's terrible.
[02:46:21.471 --> 02:46:22.272]  That's the other sick part.
[02:46:22.272 --> 02:46:23.692]  They call it National Compulsory Service.
[02:46:23.692 --> 02:46:29.615]  They're going to make school kids and graduates do this, but they say, oh, it's not slavery because we pay you.
[02:46:29.615 --> 02:46:32.317]  Well, they pay you when they draft you in the Army.
[02:46:32.317 --> 02:46:33.958]  Yeah, that's actually what Gergen says.
[02:46:33.958 --> 02:46:36.339]  He said, that's also paid volunteerism.
[02:46:36.339 --> 02:46:38.000]  What's wrong with paid volunteerism?
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:41.841]  It's not volunteerism.
[02:46:41.841 --> 02:46:44.423]  They've had acts called the National Compulsory Service Act.
[02:46:45.157 --> 02:46:47.340]  Volunteerism isn't compulsory.
[02:46:47.340 --> 02:46:48.161]  Yeah.
[02:46:48.161 --> 02:46:48.662]  And it's true.
[02:46:48.662 --> 02:46:50.264]  It's under Homeland Security.
[02:46:50.264 --> 02:46:53.829]  AmeriCorps and all of them are under Homeland Security under a branch.
[02:46:53.829 --> 02:46:57.353]  I think it's called Center for National Service or something like that.
[02:46:57.353 --> 02:46:59.476]  And they state their main job is tattling.
[02:47:00.157 --> 02:47:04.000]  These people are absolute cancer to America, and I don't just say that.
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:07.444]  This is literal, literal filth.
[02:47:07.444 --> 02:47:09.065]  They don't put up with this in Eastern Europe anymore.
[02:47:09.065 --> 02:47:10.266]  Those people ran them out.
[02:47:10.266 --> 02:47:11.567]  They don't put up with this in China.
[02:47:11.567 --> 02:47:12.648]  The people don't like it.
[02:47:12.648 --> 02:47:14.610]  They don't put up with this anywhere, folks.
[02:47:14.610 --> 02:47:18.533]  This is the dirtiest, filthiest crap there is, Aaron.
[02:47:18.533 --> 02:47:20.035]  Can you believe this is happening in America?
[02:47:20.692 --> 02:47:21.673]  It's hard to believe.
[02:47:21.673 --> 02:47:27.157]  You know, I didn't know about all this stuff at first, and then, you know, there's stuff like the Department of Defense, 1404.
[02:47:27.157 --> 02:47:35.524]  As soon as Obama started, they do have national security forces over in foreign countries holding weapons.
[02:47:35.524 --> 02:47:44.050]  And it says they will operate here domestically under NORTHCOM, and it says it will be a multi-hundred thousand man army, and then the Marines announced, look at this, this just came in Friday.
[02:47:44.050 --> 02:47:45.611]  I can't even cover all of this.
[02:47:45.611 --> 02:47:46.752]  Look at this!
[02:47:46.752 --> 02:47:47.173]  Look at this!
[02:47:47.933 --> 02:47:57.359]  This is a new, they're going to have their new domestic municipal forces that operate in and around the military bases and off the bases, and then they have regular Marines running checkpoints searching U.S.
[02:47:57.359 --> 02:47:58.240]  citizens.
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:47:59.961]  And then look at these cops!
[02:47:59.961 --> 02:48:04.384]  A national police force under the Marines to operate off base!
[02:48:04.384 --> 02:48:05.825]  Oh, hi, I'm the Marine!
[02:48:05.825 --> 02:48:07.546]  And these guys are trained folks.
[02:48:07.546 --> 02:48:11.849]  That's why we just had a We Are Changer I know real well call here.
[02:48:11.849 --> 02:48:12.930]  His sister lives in Austin.
[02:48:13.570 --> 02:48:14.411]  They pulled him over.
[02:48:14.411 --> 02:48:16.712]  They were making the guy drive into a sobriety check.
[02:48:16.712 --> 02:48:18.674]  They hadn't been drinking, by the way.
[02:48:18.674 --> 02:48:21.716]  And she starts calling her brother, Nate Evans.
[02:48:21.716 --> 02:48:23.297]  The cop walks over and says, get off your phone.
[02:48:23.297 --> 02:48:24.879]  She says, I'm allowed to be on the phone.
[02:48:24.879 --> 02:48:27.200]  Slams her face in, splits her whole head open.
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:31.424]  She's lucky they didn't gun her down in the back and then say she shouldn't have been out at night.
[02:48:31.424 --> 02:48:38.129]  Because, you know, I heard people on NewsRadio 590 call her the other day when the cops shot these two guys, saying, good, if you're out at night, you deserve to die.
[02:48:38.973 --> 02:48:43.737]  This is the level of groveling to the police now, where, yes, kill anyone out at night!
[02:48:43.737 --> 02:48:44.418]  Kill us!
[02:48:44.418 --> 02:48:45.839]  Kill us!
[02:48:45.839 --> 02:48:47.761]  You know, I mean, my God, man.
[02:48:47.761 --> 02:48:49.082]  Oh, you're just a cop basher.
[02:48:49.082 --> 02:48:52.645]  Yeah, you know.
[02:48:52.645 --> 02:48:53.366]  My God, folks.
[02:48:54.212 --> 02:48:57.714]  Well, I think they're going to phase this stuff all in with 50 different heads.
[02:48:57.714 --> 02:49:03.498]  There's going to be a kickstart, a head start, teachers for service, all these different organizations.
[02:49:03.498 --> 02:49:05.639]  All drawing paychecks with our tax money.
[02:49:05.639 --> 02:49:09.401]  Well, we all just sit here and... I mean, government is... Bush tripled the size of government.
[02:49:09.401 --> 02:49:12.163]  Obama, in the first two months, doubled the tripling.
[02:49:12.819 --> 02:49:13.660]  It's all over!
[02:49:13.660 --> 02:49:15.342]  They're like roaches.
[02:49:15.342 --> 02:49:18.947]  It's like if you turn your light on at night in the kitchen and there were 8 million roaches.
[02:49:18.947 --> 02:49:20.149]  Just piles of them.
[02:49:20.149 --> 02:49:23.333]  And they're looking at you saying, you're bad, get out of our house.
[02:49:23.333 --> 02:49:24.214]  And I guess it's true.
[02:49:24.214 --> 02:49:25.036]  They are the roaches.
[02:49:25.036 --> 02:49:26.518]  They run everything.
[02:49:26.518 --> 02:49:27.339]  And that's the end of it.
[02:49:28.063 --> 02:49:29.083]  That's terrible.
[02:49:29.083 --> 02:49:35.105]  Yeah, David Gergen's writing since 2006 about how to get government to fund more of these national service groups.
[02:49:35.105 --> 02:49:39.067]  He saw that Obama was coming and knew this thing was going to be rammed forward.
[02:49:39.067 --> 02:49:40.307]  I'm sure for a lot of other reasons.
[02:49:40.307 --> 02:49:49.710]  And then meanwhile, they've introduced three bills where any designate of the federal government can put you on a list, you can't find out why you're on a list, no more second amendment, and they come and take your guns.
[02:49:49.710 --> 02:49:54.852]  You get hit by a SWAT team, too bad if they kill you, the locals will get on the news and say, he deserved it!
[02:49:56.132 --> 02:50:00.496]  You know, I mean, and these guys are old in Iraq, confiscating guns and kicking in doors all day.
[02:50:00.496 --> 02:50:02.318]  They show up here.
[02:50:02.318 --> 02:50:05.040]  You wonder how people fell to the Nazis and stuff and the Communists?
[02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:07.843]  Because the people go along with orders, man.
[02:50:07.843 --> 02:50:14.569]  They rationalize that it's good, but it's going to get so bad that all of you are going to lose in the end and your family name is going to be destroyed.
[02:50:14.569 --> 02:50:18.733]  A lot of you cops and military are going to go to prison because we're going to beat you in the end.
[02:50:19.113 --> 02:50:33.783]  I just want, I probably won't be here after all this Aaron, but when we finally take America back and take the world back, I do want to make sure we hunt all these people down and give them a proper trial with their juries, but everybody that commits treason, I really think they need the death penalty.
[02:50:33.783 --> 02:50:37.926]  I'm sorry, I really think that they need to at least be given life in prison.
[02:50:37.926 --> 02:50:42.669]  All these prisons full of pot smokers will fill it full of government bureaucrats and cops that broke the law.
[02:50:43.956 --> 02:50:45.577]  Now, you think you're invincible now.
[02:50:45.577 --> 02:50:46.417]  You think you've won.
[02:50:46.417 --> 02:50:48.878]  You think you've destroyed the country and you've had the victory.
[02:50:48.878 --> 02:50:50.598]  No, you haven't!
[02:50:50.598 --> 02:50:51.338]  Right here.
[02:50:51.338 --> 02:50:54.859]  Bill in Congress would ban gun ownership at will.
[02:50:54.859 --> 02:50:56.420]  Now, I know a lot of cops are good.
[02:50:56.420 --> 02:50:58.000]  Do you stand with this?
[02:50:58.000 --> 02:50:59.821]  They got bills to ban free speech!
[02:50:59.821 --> 02:51:00.641]  It's happening!
[02:51:00.641 --> 02:51:01.962]  There's no more time to suck your thumb!
[02:51:01.962 --> 02:51:03.362]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:51:03.362 --> 02:51:05.103]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:51:05.103 --> 02:51:07.783]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:51:07.783 --> 02:51:12.505]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:51:12.927 --> 02:51:16.110]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[02:52:48.353 --> 02:52:51.276]  Have you ever noticed that celebrities are endorsing weight loss products and health aids?
[02:53:11.950 --> 02:53:15.753]  Do you think they endorse these products for free?
[02:53:15.753 --> 02:53:16.733]  I don't think so.
[02:53:16.733 --> 02:53:20.816]  I'm here to tell you, I'm not a celebrity, and Life Change Tea doesn't need one.
[02:53:20.816 --> 02:53:24.038]  Think about this, the product speaks for itself!
[02:53:24.674 --> 02:53:26.215]  What a concept!

[02:53:34.898 --> 02:53:39.099]  Write this down.
[02:53:39.099 --> 02:53:41.160]  928-308-0408.

[02:53:43.601 --> 02:53:44.401]  It's easy.
[02:53:44.401 --> 02:53:46.082]  GetTheTea.com.
[02:53:46.082 --> 02:53:48.583]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[02:53:48.583 --> 02:53:53.825]  You have nothing to lose, but the excess around your, uh, anyway.
[02:53:54.045 --> 02:53:55.205]  It's life change tea.
[02:53:55.205 --> 02:53:56.726]  It speaks for itself.
[02:53:56.726 --> 02:54:01.708]  That's getthetea.com.
[02:54:01.708 --> 02:54:08.991]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:08.991 --> 02:54:12.632]  Alright, I'm gonna get into the attack on the Second Amendment, which
[02:54:14.184 --> 02:54:16.526]  It's an absolute declaration of war.
[02:54:16.526 --> 02:54:19.528]  I mean, this is the, not just the end of the second, it's the end of everything.
[02:54:19.528 --> 02:54:28.994]  They say, we secretly are going to take your guns, we're secretly going to put you on list, we're going to secretly not allow you to buy guns, and you can't ever find out why, and there's no judge, no jury, no indictment.
[02:54:28.994 --> 02:54:32.676]  And if you think the cops aren't going to follow orders and carry this out, you've got another thing coming.
[02:54:32.676 --> 02:54:38.460]  Bush didn't dribble the size of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives because he wanted to play games.
[02:54:38.460 --> 02:54:39.501]  And Obama is coming.
[02:54:40.973 --> 02:54:42.534]  I can't believe it's come to this.
[02:54:42.534 --> 02:54:49.218]  They'll just pick us off one at a time, and there's these Roydhead cops that just love SWAT teaming families.
[02:54:49.218 --> 02:54:50.698]  I just can't believe it.
[02:54:50.698 --> 02:54:54.040]  And you know, don't say the government isn't rogue and isn't criminal.
[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:55.721]  I've heard enough from you!
[02:54:55.721 --> 02:54:59.963]  If I don't see police out mass protesting against the government, you're bad.
[02:54:59.963 --> 02:55:02.245]  And I don't see you out doing it!
[02:55:02.245 --> 02:55:03.845]  And look, you can be mad at me now.
[02:55:03.845 --> 02:55:04.926]  Be mad at me now.
[02:55:04.926 --> 02:55:06.087]  Wish you'd have fought back later.
[02:55:07.071 --> 02:55:08.392]  Everything's being destroyed.
[02:55:08.392 --> 02:55:09.552]  All our liberties, all our freedoms.
[02:55:09.552 --> 02:55:12.214]  I want to finish up with that in a moment.
[02:55:12.214 --> 02:55:14.695]  Huge news, most maximum level alert we've got.
[02:55:14.695 --> 02:55:17.657]  I'm going to get it out to everybody.
[02:55:17.657 --> 02:55:20.459]  I want to tell you about eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:55:20.459 --> 02:55:23.020]  They're the best storable foods company out there, bar none.
[02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:25.582]  That's where I've gotten my storable foods.
[02:55:25.582 --> 02:55:28.443]  Lasts more than 10 years in climate controlled.
[02:55:28.443 --> 02:55:32.526]  10 years in your garage or attic or in a shed if it's non-climate controlled.
[02:55:32.526 --> 02:55:34.207]  These are in these triple enameled cans.
[02:55:34.767 --> 02:55:37.148]  High quality dehydrated or freeze-dried food.
[02:55:37.148 --> 02:55:38.568]  Just incredibly low prices.
[02:55:38.568 --> 02:55:39.449]  Non-GMO.
[02:55:39.449 --> 02:55:42.130]  Just great stuff.
[02:55:42.130 --> 02:55:42.910]  800-409-5633.
[02:55:42.910 --> 02:55:46.451]  In these uncertain times, with all this craziness going on, being self-sufficient is the key.
[02:55:46.451 --> 02:55:46.531]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:55:46.531 --> 02:55:46.971]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:55:46.971 --> 02:55:47.692]  Or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:55:54.798 --> 02:56:00.941]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, 1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:56:00.941 --> 02:56:08.165]  The swine flu virus breakout may get much more serious because it's a manufactured virus.
[02:56:09.316 --> 02:56:10.417]  I told you it was that day one.
[02:56:10.417 --> 02:56:13.459]  The media now admits it, and they're saying it's going to come back out in the fall.
[02:56:13.459 --> 02:56:15.920]  With the economy, with all of this, it's good to get prepared.
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:19.442]  800-409-5633. efoodsdirect.com.
[02:56:19.442 --> 02:56:21.464]  Also, mysolarbackup.com.
[02:56:21.464 --> 02:56:25.066]  A lot of stuff can happen during these crazy times.
[02:56:25.066 --> 02:56:28.088]  Power outages, hurricanes, tornadoes, you name it.
[02:56:28.088 --> 02:56:29.409]  Government control.
[02:56:29.409 --> 02:56:32.851]  This is like having your own little power plant hidden in your house.
[02:56:32.851 --> 02:56:35.933]  1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[02:56:37.114 --> 02:56:43.160]  The PowerSource 800 power plant and high-efficiency panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:47.283]  Solar generators like having a silent power plant, as I said, hidden in your home.
[02:56:47.283 --> 02:56:50.986]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[02:56:50.986 --> 02:56:51.807]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:56:51.807 --> 02:56:52.488]  MySolarBackup.com or 1-877-327-0365.
[02:56:52.488 --> 02:56:52.648]  877-327-0365.
[02:56:52.648 --> 02:56:53.248]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:56:53.248 --> 02:56:54.009]  Now listen to me.
[02:57:03.581 --> 02:57:06.488]  They have three different bills introduced that we've covered here.
[02:57:08.012 --> 02:57:08.292]  On air.
[02:57:39.473 --> 02:57:40.054]  There's the video.
[02:57:40.054 --> 02:57:42.295]  You can watch Rahm Emanuel saying that word for word.
[02:57:42.295 --> 02:57:44.217]  I've seen it so many times, I now have it memorized.
[02:57:44.217 --> 02:57:45.718]  It's in the Obama Deception.
[02:57:45.718 --> 02:57:51.402]  Bill in Congress would ban gun ownership at will.
[02:57:51.402 --> 02:57:57.307]  And it says on May 13th, Democrat Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced the No Fly No Buy Act, H.R.
[02:57:57.307 --> 02:57:57.327]  2401.
[02:57:57.327 --> 02:58:01.470]  This is a new bill.
[02:58:01.470 --> 02:58:05.993]  They got another bill where the Attorney General could ban any guns he wants at will.
[02:58:05.993 --> 02:58:06.614]  This is tyranny.
[02:58:07.830 --> 02:58:11.954]  You know, that Kim Jong-il in North Korea, he can do whatever he wants, he's a dictator.
[02:58:11.954 --> 02:58:13.956]  Well, it's the same thing with this.
[02:58:13.956 --> 02:58:19.442]  On May 13th, Democrat Carolyn McCarthy introduced the No-Fly, No-Buy Act, H.R.
[02:58:19.442 --> 02:58:28.932]  2401, a bill that will merge the TSA's No-Fly list with the National Institute of Background Criminal Check system, which I always told you was a way of listing you as a terrorist.
[02:58:28.932 --> 02:58:31.014]  I told you years ago they were going to merge this with the No-Fly.
[02:58:32.830 --> 02:58:34.391]  I'm going to come back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:34.391 --> 02:58:37.492]  I hope stations carry this five minutes, and then we'll break all this down in detail.
[02:58:37.492 --> 02:58:39.053]  We've got a big guest coming up.
[02:58:39.053 --> 02:58:43.155]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.155 --> 02:58:45.756]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.756 --> 02:58:51.319]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.319 --> 02:58:51.959]  Hello, friends.
[02:58:51.959 --> 02:58:53.019]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.019 --> 02:58:57.762]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.762 --> 02:59:00.463]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:03.772 --> 02:59:09.837]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.837 --> 02:59:13.080]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.080 --> 02:59:19.326]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese
[02:59:19.326 --> 02:59:19.606]  I think so.
[02:59:54.136 --> 02:59:56.520]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.520 --> 03:00:05.492]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:05.492 --> 03:00:08.296]  We're scheduled to have the inventor of GNU Linux.
[03:00:11.434 --> 03:00:13.776]  Coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:13.776 --> 03:00:14.977]  I know I said we'd have open phones.
[03:00:14.977 --> 03:00:16.278]  We will later, too.
[03:00:16.278 --> 03:00:17.939]  So much is going on.
[03:00:17.939 --> 03:00:20.401]  Right now, let me finish up with the attack on the Second Amendment.
[03:00:20.401 --> 03:00:26.225]  There's one bill introduced where the Attorney General can ban any firearms at will.
[03:00:26.225 --> 03:00:30.508]  It's just like Congress voted to give all its authority over trade to foreign private
[03:00:31.249 --> 03:00:39.260]  World Trade Organization or UNESCO treaty that gives control of our schools and our policies.
[03:00:39.260 --> 03:00:41.603]  The globalists want an international criminal court with the U.S.
[03:00:41.603 --> 03:00:42.184]  signed on.
[03:00:42.184 --> 03:00:45.889]  Obama says he supports a treaty to waive our rights to the Second Amendment.
[03:00:47.150 --> 03:01:05.742]  And they have the nerve to get on the news and say, we don't get these crazy people buying guns at record levels, we don't want their guns, while the Attorney General, the White House Chief of Staff, the President, all have called publicly or introduced legislation to ban even single-shot .22s, to take every firearm from the American people, including black powder.
[03:01:05.742 --> 03:01:13.066]  Total gun ban on record, bills introduced to do it, and they just keep saying, what are you talking about?
[03:01:13.066 --> 03:01:14.247]  What are you talking about?
[03:01:14.247 --> 03:01:15.048]  I mean, these people,
[03:01:15.948 --> 03:01:17.188]  You thought Bill Clinton lied.
[03:01:17.188 --> 03:01:19.029]  You thought George Bush lied.
[03:01:19.029 --> 03:01:21.729]  I mean, Obama says he's going to get rid of torture, then he keeps it going.
[03:01:21.729 --> 03:01:25.630]  Secret arrest, secret internment, no rights for detainees, grab U.S.
[03:01:25.630 --> 03:01:31.051]  citizens, use the Patriot Act on citizens, keep warrantless wiretapping going on, hire nothing but lobbyists.
[03:01:31.051 --> 03:01:32.932]  It's all what the Obama deception covers.
[03:01:32.932 --> 03:01:36.252]  You've got to show it to people.
[03:01:36.252 --> 03:01:41.054]  I love this country so much, folks, and this is hardcore tyranny.
[03:01:41.054 --> 03:01:42.134]  I mean, this is the real deal.
[03:01:42.134 --> 03:01:42.934]  Listen to this, Bill.
[03:01:45.486 --> 03:01:52.588]  And little old Infowars, little old Kurt Nemo gets an email from a listener pointing out the bill and writes a story about it Sunday night.
[03:01:52.588 --> 03:01:53.968]  The NRA isn't going to talk about it.
[03:01:53.968 --> 03:01:58.209]  Nobody's going to talk about it, folks, but us.
[03:01:58.209 --> 03:02:05.270]  And on May 13th, Democrat Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced the No Fly, No Buy Act.
[03:02:05.270 --> 03:02:09.471]  See, we told you last week this other bill could do that because the language allowed them to.
[03:02:09.471 --> 03:02:10.812]  This states it!
[03:02:10.812 --> 03:02:12.632]  They got three bills to do this!
[03:02:14.517 --> 03:02:18.358]  There's the White House Chief of Staff calling for it to be passed.
[03:02:18.358 --> 03:02:20.819]  What more do you need, man?
[03:02:20.819 --> 03:02:24.780]  They'll still be in the Nile, though, trained to be slaves.
[03:02:24.780 --> 03:02:29.142]  On May 13, Democrat Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced the No Fly, No Buy Act, H.R. 2401.
[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:39.563]  A bill that will merge the TSA's no-fly list, with over 1,100,000 Americans, with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS.
[03:02:39.563 --> 03:02:40.623]  And this is already in place.
[03:02:40.623 --> 03:02:48.366]  Veterans, conservatives, people try to go buy guns, they're told, sorry, and then they go through the appeals process and they say, sorry, no more Second Amendment.
[03:02:48.366 --> 03:02:53.328]  See, guilty until proven innocent, then they appeal it and they're told, you can't be told why you don't get a gun, sorry.
[03:02:53.328 --> 03:02:54.588]  It's already happened.
[03:02:54.588 --> 03:02:58.790]  Just like they were already spying on us without warrants before they passed a law to do it.
[03:03:00.546 --> 03:03:04.633]  Last time I heard, bastards, you didn't repeal the Fourth Amendment.
[03:03:04.633 --> 03:03:05.254]  You're criminals.
[03:03:05.254 --> 03:03:06.115]  You're rogue.
[03:03:06.115 --> 03:03:08.439]  You can pass a law saying blacks aren't humans.
[03:03:08.439 --> 03:03:10.001]  It's a fraud.
[03:03:10.001 --> 03:03:11.083]  I'm calling you out.
[03:03:11.083 --> 03:03:12.786]  You're a stinking criminal fraud.
[03:03:14.853 --> 03:03:20.574]  On May 13th, Democrat Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced the No-Fly, No-Buy Act, H.R.
[03:03:20.574 --> 03:03:29.956]  2401, a bill that will merge the TSA's No-Fly list with the National Institute of Criminal Background Check system, a point-of-sale system for determining eligibility to purchase a firearm in the United States.
[03:03:29.956 --> 03:03:30.836]  Guam, Puerto Rico.
[03:03:30.836 --> 03:03:41.378]  It was created November of 1993, when the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 93, Public Law 103-159, was signed into law.
[03:03:41.378 --> 03:03:43.179]  Permanent provisions of the Brady Act went into effect
[03:03:44.028 --> 03:03:46.329]  November 30th, 1998, and require the U.S.
[03:03:46.329 --> 03:03:48.871]  Attorney General to establish NICS.
[03:03:48.871 --> 03:03:51.372]  NICS.
[03:03:51.372 --> 03:03:53.833]  And she goes on with a quote, and we have the bill.
[03:03:53.833 --> 03:04:02.658]  It says, we will secretly put you on this list, you will no longer be able to buy firearms, and the states are going to be implemented that you have guns illegal, and the SWAT teams are coming.
[03:04:02.658 --> 03:04:06.380]  So now you just aren't able to go on a plane, you know, old guy on a walker, I've seen it.
[03:04:06.380 --> 03:04:07.521]  I'm on no-fly list?
[03:04:07.521 --> 03:04:07.721]  Yep.
[03:04:08.922 --> 03:04:11.703]  And they call you in and ask you questions and jab you in.
[03:04:11.703 --> 03:04:21.607]  It's all about take your shoes off, be a slave, answer questions, go on a body scanner, humiliate yourself, be trained to be a slave.
[03:04:21.607 --> 03:04:25.949]  And it says improve homeland security sections, governmenttrack.us.
[03:04:28.286 --> 03:04:36.232]  ...increase public safety and reduce the threat of domestic security threat by including persons who may be prevented from boarding an aircraft of the National Instant Criminal Background System.
[03:04:36.232 --> 03:04:41.895]  So see, no judge, no jury, no arrest, no misdemeanor, no felony, no indictment, no nothing!
[03:04:41.895 --> 03:04:42.196]  You just...
[03:04:43.129 --> 03:04:43.909]  Secret list.
[03:04:43.909 --> 03:04:45.170]  No more rights.
[03:04:45.170 --> 03:04:46.171]  And folks, here's the key.
[03:04:46.171 --> 03:04:47.091]  It's going to be for everything.
[03:04:47.091 --> 03:04:49.252]  For buying, for selling, for jobs.
[03:04:49.252 --> 03:04:57.316]  This global system, just like Michael Savage can't go to England or Europe, just like I can't go to Canada, they're going to put us all on these global lists where we can't travel.
[03:04:57.316 --> 03:04:58.357]  This is only the beginning.
[03:04:58.357 --> 03:04:59.277]  They've stated it.
[03:04:59.277 --> 03:04:59.918]  That's the key.
[03:05:01.519 --> 03:05:10.169]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[03:05:10.169 --> 03:05:15.014]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[03:05:15.014 --> 03:05:20.200]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[03:06:02.046 --> 03:06:04.607]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:06:05.225 --> 03:06:07.847]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.847 --> 03:06:14.831]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.436 --> 03:06:22.020]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:22.020 --> 03:06:24.001]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:24.001 --> 03:06:26.502]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.502 --> 03:06:37.448]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:39.732]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.732 --> 03:06:41.594]  It's about a one world government.
[03:06:41.594 --> 03:06:48.501]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:06:56.769 --> 03:06:58.350]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.350 --> 03:06:59.532]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.491 --> 03:07:08.696]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:07:08.696 --> 03:07:13.260]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:07:13.260 --> 03:07:18.884]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[03:07:18.884 --> 03:07:25.949]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:07:26.409 --> 03:07:31.792]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[03:07:31.792 --> 03:07:37.634]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:07:37.634 --> 03:07:43.097]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[03:07:53.261 --> 03:07:56.802]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:56.802 --> 03:07:58.943]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:11.078 --> 03:08:18.524]  You know, I saw an article quoting Richard Stallman about attacks on the Internet and its infrastructure and free speech.
[03:08:18.524 --> 03:08:32.515]  I told my producer to get him on, and when the two IT guys here at the office found out about it, they were very giddy today, because this guy is quite a bigwig in the architecture of browsers, the Internet, you name it.
[03:08:32.515 --> 03:08:38.739]  Richard Stallman, GNU Linux inventor.
[03:08:38.739 --> 03:08:40.020]  Richard Matthew Stallman,
[03:08:41.565 --> 03:08:47.388]  Often abbreviated RMS is an American software freedom activist, hacker, and software developer.
[03:08:47.388 --> 03:08:55.292]  In September 83, he launched the GNU project to create a free Unix-like operating system and has been the project's lead architect and organizer.
[03:08:55.292 --> 03:09:02.696]  With the launch of the GNU project, he started the free software movement and in October 1985, set up the Free Software Foundation.
[03:09:02.696 --> 03:09:09.400]  You know what, if I go over his whole bio, we'll never get to him, but this is one of the, you know, I know they say Al Gore invented the internet, even though it was around
[03:09:10.180 --> 03:09:11.421]  You know, 30 years ago.
[03:09:11.421 --> 03:09:15.465]  And I know they say he probably invented the moon, actually, and the galaxy.
[03:09:15.465 --> 03:09:22.852]  But, you know, we talk about some of the folks that have actually really contributed to the infrastructure of the free web, as we know it.
[03:09:22.852 --> 03:09:26.435]  This guy is certainly an icon in what we know as the modern web, Richard Stallman.
[03:09:26.435 --> 03:09:29.498]  I want to get him on because they're trying to get rid of net neutrality.
[03:09:29.498 --> 03:09:31.099]  They're trying to change how the web works.
[03:09:31.099 --> 03:09:32.341]  The head of cybersecurity.
[03:09:32.961 --> 03:09:34.582]  Quit two months ago.
[03:09:34.582 --> 03:09:35.182]  We talked to him.
[03:09:35.182 --> 03:09:36.722]  He says he's not ready to come on the air right now.
[03:09:36.722 --> 03:09:52.007]  He's behind the scenes stuff, but he said the Feds are taking it over, the Pentagon's taking over the web, and then it came out in the news that they are taking over the actual hubs of even smaller, you know, internet, telecom systems.
[03:09:52.007 --> 03:09:55.168]  So to try to break all this down with us is Richard Stallman.
[03:09:55.168 --> 03:10:01.290]  Richard, so much is going on, and I, you know, we've got you for the about 45 minutes or so.
[03:10:01.290 --> 03:10:02.370]  It's great to have you here with us.
[03:10:03.442 --> 03:10:06.023]  Well, I'm pleased to have a chance again.
[03:10:06.023 --> 03:10:06.863]  You bet.
[03:10:06.863 --> 03:10:08.324]  Okay, you've got the floor.
[03:10:08.324 --> 03:10:09.585]  What do you think is most important?
[03:10:09.585 --> 03:10:17.288]  I mean, you've dedicated your entire professional career to liberty and freedom on this wonderful thing we call the Internet.
[03:10:17.288 --> 03:10:18.228]  How did it start?
[03:10:18.228 --> 03:10:19.909]  Where are we going?
[03:10:19.909 --> 03:10:22.670]  Well, first, I have to correct a couple of things.
[03:10:22.670 --> 03:10:26.131]  I've never worked on web browsers myself.
[03:10:26.131 --> 03:10:32.394]  I'm happy to say that there are some free, freedom-respecting web browsers, but I didn't write any of them.
[03:10:32.742 --> 03:10:40.567]  Now what I meant was just setting up an infrastructure, but I mean the group they have here that you set up is involved in a whole bunch of stuff is my point, but go ahead.
[03:10:40.567 --> 03:10:58.337]  Yes, we developed first of all the GNU operating system, which gets used together with Linux the kernel, and that's the main freedom respecting operating system that lets you use your computer without handing over control to some company.
[03:10:58.337 --> 03:10:58.517]  Now,
[03:10:59.258 --> 03:11:13.840]  We know that Microsoft Windows has a backdoor that allows Microsoft to forcibly impose changes in software without asking permission of the supposed owner of the machine.
[03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:21.482]  And we know that MacOS has a similar backdoor, except that it's Apple that can forcibly impose changes.
[03:11:21.482 --> 03:11:28.443]  They can change anything they want in the software, which means they can wipe the floor with whoever is using that machine.
[03:11:29.455 --> 03:11:38.140]  So, in effect, these two systems have no security at all against that particular company.
[03:11:38.140 --> 03:11:39.041]  And then we see U.S.
[03:11:39.041 --> 03:11:50.187]  Senators coming out, a real-life example of this, saying, oh, we'll just make it where if we think you downloaded music illegally or videos, no court, no jury, we'll just, quote, fry your computer.
[03:11:50.187 --> 03:11:54.510]  That's where all this remote access comes in, and there's so many things we could talk about.
[03:11:54.510 --> 03:11:56.091]  But, I mean, please continue with...
[03:11:58.505 --> 03:12:03.406]  Because I've seen them now trying to move towards making it where everything you have is on a remote server.
[03:12:03.406 --> 03:12:07.727]  Your computers, you know, are no longer even really operable by themselves.
[03:12:07.727 --> 03:12:09.087]  They just become terminals.
[03:12:09.087 --> 03:12:10.427]  Please continue.
[03:12:10.427 --> 03:12:21.309]  Well, these are both part of the desire to regain control over what we do with our computers and with the Internet.
[03:12:21.309 --> 03:12:22.710]  And these are not the only ways.
[03:12:22.710 --> 03:12:24.190]  Of course, they're bad.
[03:12:25.746 --> 03:12:35.412]  In fact, a PC today, any PC today, is pretty powerful compared with the machines that people were using 10 years ago.
[03:12:35.412 --> 03:12:47.539]  And the disks that they're making today are so big, why would you ever feel you need to store your data someplace other than in your own computer or your own office or your own bedroom?
[03:12:49.297 --> 03:12:55.601]  You can't even get the disks nowadays that I used to think were very big ten years ago.
[03:12:55.601 --> 03:12:58.143]  Now they don't make anything that small.
[03:12:58.143 --> 03:13:17.377]  So we should resist this tendency and I think it's a sort of marketing hype phenomenon and buzzwords are being invented including the term cloud computing which is so nebulous that nobody can really tell what it means.
[03:13:18.208 --> 03:13:22.450]  It means a different thing depending on who's using it.
[03:13:22.450 --> 03:13:25.472]  So it's not really a coherent thing to talk about.
[03:13:25.472 --> 03:13:27.553]  And so I won't say anything about it.
[03:13:27.553 --> 03:13:37.678]  But storing some data on servers is not necessarily a bad thing when it's part of a... when you're publishing it.
[03:13:37.678 --> 03:13:43.121]  When it's, for instance, something you want to put on a web server so everybody can see it.
[03:13:44.096 --> 03:13:46.298]  There's no great harm that's possible there.
[03:13:46.298 --> 03:13:52.442]  The worst that anyone could do to it is delete it and turn it off.
[03:13:52.442 --> 03:13:54.163]  And you'd know that.
[03:13:54.163 --> 03:14:00.868]  Of course, mainly that's likely to happen if somebody with power is mistreating you, but they can always do that.
[03:14:00.868 --> 03:14:08.153]  So the point is, there's no particular harm if you want to publish something from putting it on some server somewhere.
[03:14:08.153 --> 03:14:09.914]  But when you don't want to publish it,
[03:14:10.962 --> 03:14:16.211]  Then the only way to keep it privately is to keep it in your disk.
[03:14:17.603 --> 03:14:22.107]  And to use your copy of free software to do your computing.
[03:14:22.107 --> 03:14:29.432]  Well, Mr. Stallman, you know, we can kind of get into the detailed minutiae of this, and I want to do that in the limited time we have with you today, and we respect your time.
[03:14:29.432 --> 03:14:46.005]  How about the big picture of what the infrastructure, the architecture of the web has been, what the establishment and, you know, is fighting to change it over to where they have control versus what you, you know, somebody who's really fought for, you know, true freedom on the Internet, should be?
[03:14:47.543 --> 03:14:51.724]  Well, we see a lot of ways in which people are trying to take more control.
[03:14:51.724 --> 03:14:56.005]  Software as a service is one of these ways.
[03:14:56.005 --> 03:15:03.866]  In order for you to have control of your computing, you've got to do it with your copy of a free program.
[03:15:03.866 --> 03:15:11.268]  If a program you use isn't free, freedom respecting that is, that means the developer controls it and the users don't.
[03:15:11.268 --> 03:15:13.708]  So that way you've lost control over your computing.
[03:15:14.562 --> 03:15:20.867]  But if you're doing your computing in somebody else's server, you've also lost control.
[03:15:20.867 --> 03:15:27.012]  Because that means you're using his copy of the program, whatever program it is, not your copy.
[03:15:27.012 --> 03:15:29.934]  So he has control over it, and you don't.
[03:15:29.934 --> 03:15:40.343]  So the way to prevent that from happening to you is, insist on doing your computing in your computer with your copy of a free program.
[03:15:40.964 --> 03:15:42.685]  Well, here's an example.
[03:15:42.685 --> 03:15:49.488]  I was talking to an IT person for the biggest grocery chain in the nation.
[03:15:49.488 --> 03:15:53.410]  They have, I think, 25 different chains under them.
[03:15:53.410 --> 03:16:06.677]  He didn't want me to say the name, but he listed and sent me documents of the German company, and then I search engined it and found the German company that's running more than half of the supermarket supply chain systems and warehouse chain systems
[03:16:07.017 --> 03:16:07.217]  I think?
[03:16:37.898 --> 03:16:38.939]  I guess they don't.
[03:16:38.939 --> 03:16:45.368]  You see, they're not used to thinking in terms of maintaining control over their own computing.
[03:16:45.368 --> 03:16:53.438]  Now this is a paradoxical case because big companies, just by being big, have power that's dangerous to democracy.
[03:16:55.660 --> 03:16:59.062]  Suppose the business isn't so big, well then it's not dangerous.
[03:16:59.062 --> 03:17:07.767]  And the point is, the business is probably going to use computers, and it deserves to have control over its own computing, just as you and I do.
[03:17:07.767 --> 03:17:09.708]  And so they're vulnerable to this.
[03:17:09.708 --> 03:17:17.252]  But the propaganda of business says, just think of short-term profit.
[03:17:17.252 --> 03:17:20.554]  Don't think of anybody's long-term interest, not even your own.
[03:17:21.596 --> 03:17:35.164]  Also, this is why it's so common that if you let a corporation own some kind of permanent useful thing, the corporation will strip it, because it's looking for short-term profit.
[03:17:35.164 --> 03:17:40.827]  That's one of the problems of our economic system that we have wedged ourselves into.
[03:17:41.311 --> 03:17:43.153]  That's what they're doing now with the automakers.
[03:17:43.153 --> 03:17:48.037]  They're forcing them to sell off in pieces and literally strip mine it.
[03:17:48.037 --> 03:17:58.227]  What about net neutrality and how they're saying with Internet 2 you'll have a subdomain like on a MySpace or a YouTube and that then they're going to try
[03:17:58.507 --> 03:17:59.908]  I don't know about this, but I know a lot of people will fight it.
[03:18:22.108 --> 03:18:28.871]  For instance, the Free Software Foundation is not going to start posting its stuff to somebody else's server.
[03:18:28.871 --> 03:18:30.932]  We run our own servers.
[03:18:30.932 --> 03:18:34.133]  And I hope that other people will continue to do so.
[03:18:36.149 --> 03:18:54.786]  So basically, the more we build the original, real, true web, so it's really a battle of architecture then, and then we choose, just like you would choose to buy organic food to then build that market so you have more choices, we choose to use the open license software and things?
[03:18:55.464 --> 03:18:58.445]  Well, of course, I'm not in favor of making software open.
[03:18:58.445 --> 03:19:01.566]  I speak of free software because it's freedom respecting.
[03:19:01.566 --> 03:19:02.306]  Sure, sure.
[03:19:02.306 --> 03:19:08.368]  There are other people who are basically the people who like this software, but they don't want to talk about freedom.
[03:19:08.368 --> 03:19:17.451]  They coined another term, which is, quote, open source, unquote, which is a way they can promote their views where they don't want to talk about that issue.
[03:19:17.451 --> 03:19:19.551]  So it's all a semantical fight.
[03:19:19.551 --> 03:19:21.172]  Well, thank you for educating me.
[03:19:21.172 --> 03:19:22.872]  Explain it.
[03:19:22.872 --> 03:19:24.553]  Back to the point that you raised.
[03:19:25.231 --> 03:19:45.208]  Yes, we can choose by what we do, whether to use these massive corporate invite everybody to put their data into these mega servers, or we can choose otherwise, but we have to organize politically too.
[03:19:45.208 --> 03:19:46.069]  We can't expect
[03:19:46.770 --> 03:19:51.416]  Individual choice and market mechanisms to always protect our freedom.
[03:19:51.416 --> 03:19:53.619]  We have to organize to protect our freedom.
[03:19:53.619 --> 03:19:54.781]  We have to do it intentionally.
[03:19:54.781 --> 03:19:56.123]  Alright, stay there sir.
[03:19:56.123 --> 03:19:57.224]  Amazing information.
[03:19:57.224 --> 03:20:01.330]  Can't wait to get into some other topics with you and talk about the organization as well.
[03:20:01.630 --> 03:20:10.793]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[03:20:10.793 --> 03:20:18.256]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never
[03:20:18.456 --> 03:20:18.956]  I don't know it.
[03:20:18.956 --> 03:20:23.560]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[03:20:23.560 --> 03:20:26.322]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[03:20:26.322 --> 03:20:37.890]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[03:20:37.890 --> 03:20:44.334]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[03:20:44.334 --> 03:20:48.017]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an
[03:20:48.257 --> 03:20:52.219]  Excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[03:20:52.219 --> 03:20:55.140]  Order some today at FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[03:20:55.140 --> 03:20:57.501]  Again, that's FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[03:20:57.501 --> 03:20:59.542]  Or call 888-949-3570.
[03:20:59.542 --> 03:21:05.504]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[03:21:05.504 --> 03:21:12.527]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[03:21:12.527 --> 03:21:16.749]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[03:21:17.327 --> 03:21:26.885]  Call me at 800-686-2237 extension 115 and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[03:21:27.321 --> 03:21:37.384]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency, which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[03:21:37.384 --> 03:21:44.747]  Call me Dwayne Dally at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[03:21:44.747 --> 03:21:48.708]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[03:21:48.708 --> 03:21:50.109]  No amount is too small.
[03:21:50.109 --> 03:21:50.929]  So start today.
[03:21:51.468 --> 03:22:02.663]  Call Dwayne Dally with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[03:22:02.663 --> 03:22:07.911]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:22:08.673 --> 03:22:14.557]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:22:14.557 --> 03:22:21.062]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:22:21.062 --> 03:22:23.043]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:22:23.043 --> 03:22:25.505]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:22:25.505 --> 03:22:36.393]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:22:38.681 --> 03:22:40.342]  It's not about left or right.
[03:22:40.342 --> 03:22:42.203]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:22:42.203 --> 03:22:49.128]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:22:49.128 --> 03:22:57.373]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:57.373 --> 03:22:58.954]  The Obama Deception.
[03:22:58.954 --> 03:23:00.135]  The people strike back.
[03:23:01.926 --> 03:23:03.287]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:23:03.287 --> 03:23:05.687]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[03:23:05.687 --> 03:23:09.849]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[03:23:09.849 --> 03:23:13.611]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:23:13.611 --> 03:23:22.174]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:23:22.174 --> 03:23:26.015]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[03:23:26.015 --> 03:23:30.077]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing
[03:23:37.244 --> 03:23:38.825]  The Alex Jones Show are foolish.
[03:23:38.825 --> 03:23:40.387]  Don't call eFoodsDirect.
[03:23:40.387 --> 03:23:46.312]  For the rest of you, go to eFoodsDirect.com or call 800-409-5633.
[03:23:46.312 --> 03:23:52.377]  You can't possibly know or control what government, corporate America, or others will do, but you can control what you do.
[03:23:52.377 --> 03:23:53.798]  Complete your supply now.
[03:23:53.798 --> 03:23:55.079]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:23:55.079 --> 03:23:55.220]  800-409-5633.
[03:23:55.220 --> 03:23:55.260]  800-409-5633.
[03:24:13.866 --> 03:24:17.128]  Richard Stallman's our guest, internet icon.
[03:24:17.128 --> 03:24:29.854]  Sir, is it better to just have folks go to GNU.org, the foundation there, or what are some other sites folks can visit to read your writings and analysis and breakdowns?
[03:24:29.854 --> 03:24:36.937]  GNU.org, GNU.org, is the website about the GNU system and the free software movement.
[03:24:36.937 --> 03:24:40.999]  The Free Software Foundation has a website, FFF.org.
[03:24:41.858 --> 03:24:59.985]  And there you can find things like resource information, lists of useful free programs, lists of hardware devices that don't require any non-free programs, people who provide support as a business for free software, and other useful things.
[03:24:59.985 --> 03:25:06.167]  And you could also join the Free Software Foundation, which is the main way that we pay our staff.
[03:25:06.167 --> 03:25:08.628]  Now, I'm a volunteer, but the staff get paid.
[03:25:09.184 --> 03:25:14.566]  Sure, folks should definitely join that because we probably wouldn't have as much freedom as we have now if it wasn't for you guys.
[03:25:14.566 --> 03:25:16.227]  You know, again, I'm no IT guy.
[03:25:16.227 --> 03:25:18.508]  I can barely send an email.
[03:25:18.508 --> 03:25:24.771]  But just because I do lease a lot of servers and CDNs and own some, I know some about it.
[03:25:24.771 --> 03:25:27.232]  And always talking to IT people, you know, they talk about how
[03:25:28.297 --> 03:25:29.998]  Well, sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.
[03:25:56.095 --> 03:26:00.497]  Because I won't claim that every non-free program is badly written.
[03:26:00.497 --> 03:26:03.078]  You know, those people are not all stupid.
[03:26:03.078 --> 03:26:04.859]  Some of them are very capable.
[03:26:04.859 --> 03:26:07.620]  It's just that they don't respect your freedom.
[03:26:07.620 --> 03:26:16.123]  So, it's true, however, quite often they have very bad security, even against third parties.
[03:26:16.123 --> 03:26:24.387]  For instance, with cell phones, there are viruses that can get into cell phones.
[03:26:24.387 --> 03:26:24.547]  So,
[03:26:25.353 --> 03:26:37.482]  They can then invoke the cell phone's ability to turn on as a listening device without ringing, without showing any sign that it's making a call.
[03:26:37.482 --> 03:26:47.450]  It's still listening to the sound that comes in to the microphone, like whatever conversation you're having with people, and sending that to whoever.
[03:26:47.450 --> 03:26:53.174]  But you may be safer if you use a cell phone that's all free software.
[03:26:54.454 --> 03:26:56.077]  And there are some.
[03:26:56.077 --> 03:26:58.260]  There is the OpenMoko phone.
[03:26:58.260 --> 03:27:00.744]  I don't know how well that's working yet.
[03:27:00.744 --> 03:27:07.595]  And I think if you get the professional version of the Google phone, then that's really free software.
[03:27:07.595 --> 03:27:09.698]  Although I'm not sure all of it is free software.
[03:27:11.371 --> 03:27:12.351]  Amazing.
[03:27:12.351 --> 03:27:13.272]  Long segment coming up.
[03:27:13.272 --> 03:27:15.813]  This one's short, but another question.
[03:27:15.813 --> 03:27:30.438]  And again, all these IT people and hackers send me this stuff, and it's mainline Pentagon reports and Air Force, Cyber Command, San Antonio, and it's the general commanding their forces to attack our own Internet, to test its strengths and weaknesses, and then
[03:27:31.258 --> 03:27:42.445]  I've seen, hackers have told me and I've seen some blurbs about how it's really the government hacking the hospitals and hacking power plants to then have a pretext to bring in more of their own control.
[03:27:42.445 --> 03:27:50.429]  Are you familiar with government's false flagging or staging attacks on their own systems as a pretext to get more funding and control?
[03:27:50.429 --> 03:27:57.374]  Well, I don't know about any instances of that on the internet.
[03:27:57.374 --> 03:27:59.315]  That's not what I specialize in.
[03:28:00.413 --> 03:28:08.141]  I haven't read news about a thing like that that I recall, but it wouldn't surprise me that much.
[03:28:08.141 --> 03:28:22.676]  I mean, if you could have the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and you could have the supposed weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, then I guess, why wouldn't they lie about who is
[03:28:25.202 --> 03:28:32.567]  I wouldn't put it past them to stage such an attack and lie about it, but that doesn't mean that I know that they're doing so.
[03:28:32.567 --> 03:28:34.648]  Sure, that really wasn't in the news.
[03:28:34.648 --> 03:28:36.230]  I mean, there were a few stories.
[03:28:36.230 --> 03:28:41.713]  It's mainly bizarre, hour-long video briefings with the Air Force and people.
[03:28:41.713 --> 03:28:49.039]  And I'm sure you did hear about the head of cybersecurity a couple months ago quit and said, the feds are taking over the web, I won't be part of this.
[03:28:49.039 --> 03:28:53.742]  I mean, when their own head of cybersecurity quits, I think we have a big problem here.
[03:28:54.793 --> 03:28:59.538]  Yeah, I didn't read about that, and now that I've heard it from you, I'll take a look.
[03:28:59.538 --> 03:29:05.064]  Now there's so much going on, I can't keep track of it all either, and it was only in a few articles.
[03:29:05.064 --> 03:29:08.068]  When we come back, I want to talk about how do we save the internet?
[03:29:08.068 --> 03:29:09.169]  How do we expand it?
[03:29:09.169 --> 03:29:13.974]  How do we make it more free versus the architecture that it seems to be leaning towards?
[03:29:13.974 --> 03:29:15.396]  Go ahead and start down those lines, sir.
[03:29:16.385 --> 03:29:22.110]  Well, my work will help you make sure that your computer is under your control.
[03:29:22.110 --> 03:29:27.555]  But beyond that, there's nothing that each one of us can directly do.
[03:29:27.555 --> 03:29:39.225]  So, if there's censorship, or if there is, say, surveillance going on in the internet that connects you to me,
[03:29:40.503 --> 03:29:44.687]  Neither you nor I can simply make a change to turn that off.
[03:29:44.687 --> 03:29:48.391]  The only way I know of we could stop that... Well, stay there!
[03:29:48.391 --> 03:29:49.211]  Gotta break!
[03:29:49.211 --> 03:29:51.854]  I'm sorry to interrupt, gotta break for the satellite.
[03:29:51.854 --> 03:29:53.235]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.235 --> 03:29:55.777]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.777 --> 03:29:58.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.513 --> 03:30:03.194]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:30:03.194 --> 03:30:07.957]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:30:07.957 --> 03:30:10.920]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:30:10.920 --> 03:30:13.962]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:30:13.962 --> 03:30:17.764]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[03:30:17.764 --> 03:30:23.288]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:30:23.288 --> 03:30:30.173]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:30:30.333 --> 03:30:33.534]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:30:33.534 --> 03:30:38.675]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:38.675 --> 03:30:44.957]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:30:44.957 --> 03:30:52.098]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:30:52.098 --> 03:30:56.299]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:56.299 --> 03:30:57.440]  Take action today.
[03:30:57.440 --> 03:30:59.220]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:31:02.054 --> 03:31:07.858]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:07.858 --> 03:31:14.843]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.433 --> 03:31:22.038]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.038 --> 03:31:23.999]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:23.999 --> 03:31:26.501]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.501 --> 03:31:37.448]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.067 --> 03:31:39.748]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.748 --> 03:31:41.610]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.610 --> 03:31:48.515]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:31:48.515 --> 03:31:56.782]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:56.782 --> 03:31:58.363]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.363 --> 03:31:59.544]  The people strike back.
[03:32:01.511 --> 03:32:02.412]  Attention, gardeners!
[03:32:02.412 --> 03:32:04.993]  This is an urgent GCN Self-Reliance Update.
[03:32:04.993 --> 03:32:09.536]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[03:32:09.536 --> 03:32:17.741]  It's called Proto-Grow, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[03:32:17.741 --> 03:32:20.563]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[03:32:20.848 --> 03:32:28.470]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[03:32:28.470 --> 03:32:34.292]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[03:32:34.292 --> 03:32:40.134]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[03:32:40.134 --> 03:32:43.375]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[03:32:43.675 --> 03:32:47.278]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[03:32:47.278 --> 03:32:52.342]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[03:32:52.342 --> 03:32:55.264]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[03:32:55.264 --> 03:32:55.504]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:33:16.837 --> 03:33:21.338]  Well, we really appreciate Richard Stallman joining us.
[03:33:21.338 --> 03:33:22.878]  We'll give you the website tonight.
[03:33:22.878 --> 03:33:24.879]  Get involved and donate.
[03:33:24.879 --> 03:33:28.679]  Be part of the organization.
[03:33:28.679 --> 03:33:31.160]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, those are the Lakotas.
[03:33:31.160 --> 03:33:34.320]  I didn't lie when I told you these are the prettiest silver coins I've ever seen.
[03:33:34.320 --> 03:33:36.141]  Put out by the Native American Nation.
[03:33:36.141 --> 03:33:38.321]  Pay about those in the last two minutes of the show today.
[03:33:38.321 --> 03:33:39.521]  Look at those babies.
[03:33:39.521 --> 03:33:42.162]  No wonder that's the best-selling silver coin out there right now.
[03:33:42.162 --> 03:33:42.522]  All right.
[03:33:44.343 --> 03:33:45.303]  We'll tell you about a few sponsors.
[03:33:45.303 --> 03:33:47.945]  We're going back to Mr. Stallman.
[03:33:47.945 --> 03:33:50.506]  Again, the website is GNU.org.
[03:33:50.506 --> 03:33:52.287]  We'll give you out some of the others as well.
[03:33:52.287 --> 03:34:02.092]  I suggest everybody out there start fighting for the internet, for freedom of computing, because there is no doubt what Jay Rockefeller is saying, we'd be better off not having an internet, that these guys mean business.
[03:34:02.092 --> 03:34:05.974]  Before we go back to our guest, AcolaBlue.com is one of our great sponsors.
[03:34:07.088 --> 03:34:18.551]  Atmospheric water generator in your own home grabs the neutral pH water out of the air, then passes it through seven filters, including carbon, reverse osmosis, and an antibacterial antifungal UV light.
[03:34:18.551 --> 03:34:20.732]  Check out more at Ecoloblue.com.
[03:34:20.732 --> 03:34:23.433]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, or 1-800-691-6043.
[03:34:23.433 --> 03:34:23.473]  1-800-691.
[03:34:27.734 --> 03:34:28.435]  Sixty-fourty-three.
[03:34:28.435 --> 03:34:31.297]  And another great sponsor is Pepperspray.com.
[03:34:31.297 --> 03:34:35.179]  You know, a lot of cities and counties and states have restrictions on the Second Amendment.
[03:34:35.179 --> 03:34:40.583]  People send their wives and daughters and sons out in their apartments or homes unarmed.
[03:34:40.583 --> 03:34:41.644]  I believe in tasers.
[03:34:41.644 --> 03:34:42.584]  I believe in stun guns.
[03:34:42.584 --> 03:34:43.505]  I believe in pepper spray.
[03:34:43.505 --> 03:34:44.626]  I believe in non-lethal
[03:34:45.166 --> 03:35:05.735]  Self-defense and as the economy implodes and home invasions explode it is now time if you don't want a firearm to get a high-quality mace gun pepper spray They got so many products around since 94 the best company out there the best price is free shipping on orders above $99 Check them out ladies and gentlemen at pepper spray one word pepper spray comm or 1-800-908-9988 1-800-908-9988 1-800-908-9988
[03:35:13.238 --> 03:35:22.500]  Okay, let's go back to Richard Stallman, who invented the GNU Linux system, has a big free software internet freedom organization.
[03:35:22.500 --> 03:35:26.401]  Again, sir, I'm literally a troglodyte when it comes to all these terms.
[03:35:26.401 --> 03:35:32.902]  Again, reintroduce yourself for folks that don't know, and I'm just going to sit back, shut up, and hear what your solutions are, ways to fight this.
[03:35:32.902 --> 03:35:37.463]  You got cut off by the break with how do we stop the government, governments,
[03:35:38.123 --> 03:35:41.745]  Well, what I started 25 years ago was developing a free software operating system called GNU.
[03:35:59.167 --> 03:35:59.807]  I think so.
[03:36:15.174 --> 03:36:20.699]  The program to work a certain way, they're free to develop their version which works that way.
[03:36:20.699 --> 03:36:27.584]  Those who know how to program do it, and those who have the same preferences use that version.
[03:36:27.584 --> 03:36:29.866]  And if they don't like that version, they use some other version.
[03:36:30.481 --> 03:36:34.642]  And you could also pay people to make the changes you want.
[03:36:34.642 --> 03:36:50.705]  So, for instance, your show, if you wanted to change a free program, where you personally don't know how, maybe none of your staff knows how, but there are companies that would make those changes, just as there are carpenters you could hire to make changes in your office.
[03:36:50.705 --> 03:36:52.946]  And they'll just do the work the way you want it done.
[03:36:53.863 --> 03:37:00.665]  And if you want to change it again some other day, you can hire somebody else, because nobody has a monopoly.
[03:37:00.665 --> 03:37:04.907]  It's a free market, this business of support for free software.
[03:37:04.907 --> 03:37:06.807]  And does that allow a kind of evolution?
[03:37:06.807 --> 03:37:14.710]  It seems like where the non-free softwares are stagnant, except for minor changes, this accelerates development, doesn't it?
[03:37:14.710 --> 03:37:16.231]  Well, it may or may not.
[03:37:16.231 --> 03:37:17.271]  I won't claim that all
[03:37:17.862 --> 03:37:20.102]  Non-free programs are stagnant.
[03:37:20.102 --> 03:37:32.125]  That depends how much work the developer is putting in, but regardless of whether it makes fast progress or slow progress, it makes progress in the direction that the developer wants.
[03:37:32.125 --> 03:37:43.647]  And if there's something the developer doesn't want you to be able to do, like for instance, access a certain file more than five times, he'll program it not to let you.
[03:37:45.430 --> 03:37:54.792]  Proprietary programs frequently have these malicious features, which we call Digital Restrictions Management, or DRM, or Digital Handcuffs.
[03:37:54.792 --> 03:37:57.933]  They are designed to stop you from doing things.
[03:37:57.933 --> 03:38:05.035]  So that program may not be your servant, it may be your prison guard.
[03:38:05.035 --> 03:38:08.736]  In any case, these are things that we can take control of ourselves.
[03:38:09.364 --> 03:38:16.428]  We can free ourselves and each other and that's what we've been doing in the free software movement since I started it.
[03:38:16.428 --> 03:38:22.051]  But there are other areas where we just can't solve the problem that way.
[03:38:22.051 --> 03:38:25.792]  Surveillance in the internet service provider.
[03:38:25.792 --> 03:38:34.057]  We can't stop that by choosing to use a different program in our own computers because it's not happening in our computers.
[03:38:34.057 --> 03:38:36.378]  It's happening in some central office.
[03:38:37.145 --> 03:38:48.730]  Now, one thing that helps somewhat is to use programs like the GDU Privacy Guard for encryption of the messages and files we send each other.
[03:38:48.730 --> 03:38:52.952]  But even that, even encryption doesn't do the whole job.
[03:38:52.952 --> 03:39:04.578]  And when there is censorship, you know, in Australia, the main organization that fights for civil liberties on the Internet, which is Electronic Frontiers Australia, was
[03:39:05.387 --> 03:39:14.932]  Forced to take down a link that they had put up in a discussion of censorship showing what kinds of things are getting censored.
[03:39:14.932 --> 03:39:20.615]  Well, they were forced to take down that link on the threat of being fined $11,000 a day.
[03:39:22.756 --> 03:39:23.736]  Let me back you up on that.
[03:39:23.736 --> 03:39:43.924]  They've announced, the government itself calls it Chinese-style net censorship, and proudly are now issuing hundreds and hundreds of sites, they're now saying thousands on these lists, that you can't visit, you can't link to, and then you can't link and say, look, WikiLeaks, leaking government documents, you can't even say that's been censored.
[03:39:43.924 --> 03:39:46.965]  That's very 1984 Kafka-esque.
[03:39:46.965 --> 03:39:51.327]  Yeah, well, the Australian government has been trashing human rights
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:40:06.784]  For many years, typically in the name of preventing terrorism, as many other governments are doing, you know, any given week their excuse is either terrorists or pedophiles.
[03:40:06.784 --> 03:40:12.485]  But neither of them is anywhere near as dangerous as governments that don't respect our freedom.
[03:40:13.749 --> 03:40:14.471]  Absolutely.
[03:40:14.471 --> 03:40:17.978]  Historically, governments killed 200-something million people last century.
[03:40:17.978 --> 03:40:23.069]  I mean, tyranny has gotten a whole new lease on life.
[03:40:25.051 --> 03:40:26.892]  So specifically, what do we do?
[03:40:26.892 --> 03:40:36.299]  I mean, if citizens and companies try to go with free software solutions and support groups like yours, what else can we do?
[03:40:36.299 --> 03:40:39.502]  I mean, I guess we vote with our dollars, we vote with our time.
[03:40:39.502 --> 03:40:51.110]  I mean, let's say I'm a company with twenty-something... For centralized surveillance and censorship, they don't let you vote with your time or with your dollars.
[03:40:51.110 --> 03:40:52.351]  Now, if you're in Australia,
[03:40:52.933 --> 03:40:56.402]  And you want to make links to these forbidden sites?
[03:40:56.402 --> 03:40:59.851]  For instance, the political sites that talk about Australian censorship?
[03:41:01.098 --> 03:41:04.580]  You can't do that by picking one company over another.
[03:41:04.580 --> 03:41:10.683]  You'd have to put your site outside of Australia, and then maybe Australia wouldn't let anybody link to your site.
[03:41:10.683 --> 03:41:11.723]  Yeah, that's the key.
[03:41:11.723 --> 03:41:14.544]  That's what Australia is saying they're going to do, is block most of the web.
[03:41:14.544 --> 03:41:24.149]  But I mean, that's the key, is that that's what Homeland Security has announced, that they're going to take over all the infrastructure, even of private companies, and as indentured servants, they have to allow
[03:41:25.289 --> 03:41:28.691]  It is, and the solution I've been using is no good for this.
[03:41:28.691 --> 03:41:29.732]  So, what can we do?
[03:41:29.732 --> 03:41:32.013]  We have to organize politically in mass organizations.
[03:41:55.147 --> 03:41:57.830]  The only organization that I know of in the U.S.
[03:41:57.830 --> 03:42:08.999]  that fights against these things is the Electronic Frontier Foundation, although I think the American Civil Liberties Union fights also against some of them.
[03:42:08.999 --> 03:42:11.521]  So both of those organizations deserve your support.
[03:42:13.806 --> 03:42:20.611]  You know, is it that Americans and Australians and British and others have had so much freedom in the past, we can't believe it's happening here?
[03:42:20.611 --> 03:42:26.215]  Or have we lied to ourselves about how much freedom was really in our society?
[03:42:26.215 --> 03:42:29.658]  I think that it's a combination of both.
[03:42:29.658 --> 03:42:39.405]  It's certainly the case that there was much less surveillance of all our communication in the past.
[03:42:39.405 --> 03:42:43.128]  You see, this is one thing that digital technology makes much easier.
[03:42:44.942 --> 03:42:52.548]  In the 1960s, I don't think anything kept track of who you called locally.
[03:42:52.548 --> 03:42:54.690]  The phone exchange didn't keep track.
[03:42:54.690 --> 03:43:00.474]  It just counted up how many calls you made and sometimes how long they were.
[03:43:00.474 --> 03:43:09.122]  The only thing you got on your bill was long distance calls because they were expensive and people wanted to know what they were being billed for.
[03:43:09.122 --> 03:43:12.945]  Now, in France, after World War II,
[03:43:14.375 --> 03:43:20.760]  The government insisted that the phone company must not keep any records of who called whom.
[03:43:20.760 --> 03:43:40.854]  And the reason was that when the Nazis took over France, they looked at those records to see who spoke to whom, and that way if they knew that one person seemed to be possibly a center of political opposition, they would not only arrest him, but they would question all the people he tended to make phone calls to.
[03:43:42.905 --> 03:43:55.100]  After the war, the French government and various other governments in Europe established rules that the phone companies were not allowed to keep track.
[03:43:55.100 --> 03:43:57.023]  However, of course, they've changed all that.
[03:43:58.086 --> 03:43:58.847]  Well, exactly.
[03:43:58.847 --> 03:44:01.569]  I just saw a story in the London Telegraph.
[03:44:01.569 --> 03:44:04.532]  In fact, guys, will you search engine this?
[03:44:04.532 --> 03:44:06.854]  People have corrected me not to just always say Google, Google.
[03:44:06.854 --> 03:44:11.859]  We need to plug Lycos and Scroogle.org and everybody else.
[03:44:11.859 --> 03:44:19.285]  In fact, I'll ask you what you think are some good alternatives because I think Google is becoming evil, at least from what I've seen.
[03:44:19.285 --> 03:44:20.607]  But it was in the French news.
[03:44:21.832 --> 03:44:33.576]  That people are real mad that a guy's friend sent him a message saying don't blow up the train because he was going on a ride and they were there waiting for him when he got to the train station.
[03:44:33.576 --> 03:44:42.079]  It was another case of an airport where they made a joke in another European country and they admitted they said oh no the phone companies have AI NSA type keyword
[03:44:42.899 --> 03:44:48.002]  Reading all of it, and then flagging it, everything is red.
[03:44:48.002 --> 03:44:52.805]  And that kind of freaked the French out to realize, but the same thing's going on here now.
[03:44:52.805 --> 03:44:55.527]  This is just so disgusting.
[03:44:55.527 --> 03:45:07.754]  Well, one thing people can do about that is just throw these things randomly into phone calls, the way they do, the way people have done for decades, randomly into their messages.
[03:45:09.784 --> 03:45:20.466]  I don't know if anybody was ever looking for keywords in messages to decide to read them, but if people have fun, at least.
[03:45:21.132 --> 03:45:25.314]  Setting up programs that would automatically put such keywords into their mail.
[03:45:25.314 --> 03:45:29.556]  No, the NSA admits they do that, and that's one of the 20-year-old technologies, as I'm sure you know.
[03:45:29.556 --> 03:45:43.202]  You're being humble, but no, I mean, in fact, there was articles in like 2002 where they were complaining that citizens... What's the term for that where I say, yeah, I got the football, I got the green stuff.
[03:45:43.202 --> 03:45:45.083]  Yeah, did you hear about that nuke that's going to go off?
[03:45:45.083 --> 03:45:46.064]  Yeah, I'll tell you what else.
[03:45:46.604 --> 03:45:50.846]  Well, I hope so, because if we keep them busy enough, maybe they won't attack us as much.
[03:45:50.846 --> 03:45:52.747]  But I have a feeling that that won't solve the problem.
[03:46:13.999 --> 03:46:27.789]  I don't see anything that's going to solve this problem except talking about freedom and demanding freedom and condemning the government to tax on our freedom and rejecting the excuses.
[03:46:27.789 --> 03:46:28.970]  So it's political will.
[03:46:28.970 --> 03:46:32.913]  We've got to recognize tyranny when it's in front of our nose.
[03:46:32.913 --> 03:46:36.635]  That's the only solution I can see, if it's a solution.
[03:46:36.635 --> 03:46:37.916]  It's not going to be easy.
[03:46:37.916 --> 03:46:43.080]  I wish I knew some clever technical method that could protect our freedom.
[03:46:44.085 --> 03:46:54.799]  I was lucky, you know, in one particular area I saw a way that through technical work we could protect our freedom, but only particular aspects of our freedom.
[03:46:54.799 --> 03:46:57.343]  All the others, well, they're different.
[03:46:59.534 --> 03:47:00.294]  Absolutely.
[03:47:00.294 --> 03:47:03.755]  Well, we're really appreciative of your time, sir.
[03:47:03.755 --> 03:47:18.377]  Other facets, other points that people should be made aware of from your research and others' research that are real threats to freedom right now, because it seems not just threats, we have this surveillance being institutionalized to where there's just no such thing as a Fourth Amendment.
[03:47:18.377 --> 03:47:20.058]  Yes.
[03:47:20.058 --> 03:47:28.039]  We see the logic for reasoning about privacy rights is screwed up in the U.S.
[03:47:29.240 --> 03:47:32.881]  It may have worked okay in the past.
[03:47:32.881 --> 03:47:39.702]  The argument usually is if a policeman could see it from the street, then he's got a right to look.
[03:47:39.702 --> 03:47:44.343]  And that made sense, sort of, in 1960.
[03:47:44.343 --> 03:47:55.685]  But now, with computers that can record so much data, if it's okay for the police to set up cameras and other kinds of sensors,
[03:47:56.839 --> 03:47:57.760]  We're good to go.
[03:48:10.256 --> 03:48:12.557]  Yeah, and the pendulum's going the wrong way.
[03:48:12.557 --> 03:48:13.417]  Well, look at London.
[03:48:13.417 --> 03:48:21.639]  Four million cameras, and now they've made it illegal to videotape the police, and they walk up and threaten to arrest tourists now videotaping monuments.
[03:48:21.639 --> 03:48:28.701]  I mean, you know, government is way out of control because private corporate interests have turned government into nothing but their little lapdogs.
[03:48:28.701 --> 03:48:37.744]  Yes, and a large part of the cause of this, actually, is so-called free trade treaties, which I'd rather call low-wage treaties.
[03:48:38.726 --> 03:48:47.050]  Because these treaties take the power from governments and give them to businesses.
[03:48:47.050 --> 03:48:53.834]  The businesses say to the governments, if you don't do exactly what we want, we'll move to some other country.
[03:48:53.834 --> 03:48:59.557]  And the governments respond by saying, oh yes, we'll do whatever you want.
[03:48:59.557 --> 03:49:03.579]  Of course, the politicians mostly aren't really strongly
[03:49:04.894 --> 03:49:05.195]  I don't
[03:49:23.913 --> 03:49:29.516]  The companies will all just move to another country, so it's futile to even try to regulate them.
[03:49:29.516 --> 03:49:36.440]  And then that creates a global standardized corporate law, which has no liberty, no freedom, no due process.
[03:49:36.440 --> 03:49:47.887]  They call that globalism, and then they hire a bunch of phony leftists and right-wingers to go around pushing it and spewing it, and now they're trying to move Internet control into these international bodies.
[03:49:47.887 --> 03:49:50.348]  Do you think the Internet's going to survive?
[03:49:50.348 --> 03:49:51.529]  I can't see the future.
[03:49:52.361 --> 03:49:56.924]  I tend to be somewhat of a pessimist by nature.
[03:49:56.924 --> 03:50:02.007]  It's just that even if I feel discouraged, I keep on fighting.
[03:50:02.007 --> 03:50:14.535]  So, it's not particularly bad that I'm a pessimist, but the point is, if I tried to answer that question, all I could do is tell you my pessimism, which doesn't prove anything.
[03:50:14.535 --> 03:50:15.376]  That's not the point.
[03:50:15.376 --> 03:50:18.938]  The real question is, what can we do to fight this?
[03:50:18.938 --> 03:50:20.699]  We have to demand the abolition
[03:50:21.189 --> 03:50:23.051]  of these so-called free trade treaties.
[03:50:23.051 --> 03:50:27.515]  You see, the arguments for those free trade treaties are narrow-minded.
[03:50:27.515 --> 03:50:32.300]  They say, well, it makes for economic efficiencies, and it does.
[03:50:32.300 --> 03:50:39.307]  If all you're interested in is pure, flat-out efficiency of production, then, yeah, they work.
[03:50:39.307 --> 03:50:44.612]  But they give all their benefits to rich people, and they corrupt the laws.
[03:50:45.279 --> 03:50:53.930]  Of every country that's participating, and that hurts us far more than the benefits economically we might hope to get.
[03:50:53.930 --> 03:50:56.993]  Alright, final segment with our guest, Richard Stallman.
[03:50:56.993 --> 03:50:58.315]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:50:58.315 --> 03:50:58.796]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.806 --> 03:51:04.269]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[03:51:04.269 --> 03:51:08.074]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[03:51:08.074 --> 03:51:10.898]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[03:51:10.898 --> 03:51:18.088]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[03:51:18.228 --> 03:51:18.949]  We're good to go.
[03:51:34.682 --> 03:51:38.826]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[03:51:38.826 --> 03:51:43.930]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:51:43.930 --> 03:51:49.675]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[03:51:49.675 --> 03:51:54.139]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:51:54.139 --> 03:51:56.781]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[03:51:56.781 --> 03:51:57.262]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:52:02.307 --> 03:52:07.533]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.334 --> 03:52:14.218]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.218 --> 03:52:20.722]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.722 --> 03:52:22.683]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.683 --> 03:52:25.145]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.145 --> 03:52:36.052]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.343 --> 03:52:40.004]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.004 --> 03:52:41.864]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.864 --> 03:52:48.767]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.767 --> 03:52:57.030]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.030 --> 03:52:58.610]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.610 --> 03:52:59.791]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.909 --> 03:53:11.616]  Hi, my name is MZ, owner of KSCO in Santa Cruz, California, and like Alex Jones, I'm passionate about talk radio, that great bastion of freedom of expression for us all.
[03:53:11.616 --> 03:53:25.446]  I'm also passionate about helping people know the joys, benefits, and surprisingly simple methods of becoming entrepreneurs who work for themselves and not as wage slaves for someone else, or even worse, for large companies with no heart and soul, nor loyalty to their employees.
[03:53:25.686 --> 03:53:44.883]  If you are tired of being dependent on others for a living and ready to start owning yourself, loving your work, and setting the sky as the limit for your earning potential, I want you to know about an exciting great business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that actually helps people lose weight and can help them make money, perhaps lots of it, just by helping us spread the word about this wonderful unique product.
[03:53:44.943 --> 03:53:47.805]  Get on the web and go to www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:53:47.805 --> 03:53:49.986]  That's www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:53:49.986 --> 03:53:51.227]  And check out our opportunity.
[03:53:51.227 --> 03:53:52.608]  You'll know pretty quick if you're interested.
[03:53:52.608 --> 03:53:54.949]  If you are, we will connect with you and get you up and running.
[03:53:54.949 --> 03:53:58.432]  We don't want any money from you, and you'll be amazed at how simple this system is.
[03:53:58.432 --> 03:54:00.673]  Remember www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:54:00.673 --> 03:54:06.717]  All right, folks.
[03:54:06.717 --> 03:54:08.078]  The show is almost over.
[03:54:08.078 --> 03:54:10.900]  Rebroadcast with reports from Bilderberg 2009.
[03:54:10.900 --> 03:54:14.142]  Kind of a wrap-up of all the latest developments there.
[03:54:16.261 --> 03:54:23.245]  And bills to where without arrest, without charge, it just puts you on a terror list as a citizen, like the no-fly list, you can't own guns.
[03:54:23.245 --> 03:54:24.286]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[03:54:24.286 --> 03:54:27.428]  Free speech bills, where if you hurt somebody's feelings, you're arrested.
[03:54:27.428 --> 03:54:28.888]  Cyberbullying Act.
[03:54:28.888 --> 03:54:30.429]  And of course, it's internet only.
[03:54:30.429 --> 03:54:34.132]  You know, we notice that the media and the establishment have tried to demonize the internet, sir.
[03:54:35.192 --> 03:54:39.853]  And they've tried to, but now they're kind of having to join it, but they still demonize it at the same time.
[03:54:39.853 --> 03:54:56.157]  I'm pessimistic, but I'm also positive that they've tried to control it and demonize it and kind of mutate it before, and that they are getting a lot of what they want in the way of tyranny, but in a way people are just ignoring them, and we're going around them.
[03:54:56.157 --> 03:54:58.938]  Or, final comments on that front, anything positive?
[03:54:59.722 --> 03:55:05.487]  Um, you may be partly right, but you know, I don't keep track of the things that are working well.
[03:55:05.487 --> 03:55:10.852]  I read the news about the threats and the outrages.
[03:55:10.852 --> 03:55:16.417]  So yeah, I keep on using the internet to talk with people about the free software movement.
[03:55:16.417 --> 03:55:26.626]  I continue posting links to articles about various kinds of outrages typically committed by governments and religious fanatics and
[03:55:27.524 --> 03:55:30.601]  Uh, so far I haven't been stopped from doing this.
[03:55:30.601 --> 03:55:30.662]  No.
[03:55:31.837 --> 03:55:37.200]  Well, I agree with you that we need to focus on the bad stuff that's happening so that the good can continue to be gotten out.
[03:55:37.200 --> 03:55:38.401]  We just commend you.
[03:55:38.401 --> 03:55:40.542]  How do folks visit the two different organizations?
[03:55:40.542 --> 03:55:42.203]  How do they support what you're doing, sir?
[03:55:42.203 --> 03:55:46.886]  Well, there's GNU.org, which is the site of the GNU system and the Free Software Movement.
[03:55:46.886 --> 03:55:53.730]  There's FFF.org, which is the Free Software Foundation, where they can join and get other resources.
[03:55:53.730 --> 03:55:57.792]  And my personal site is Stallman.org, and that's where I post
[03:55:58.513 --> 03:56:06.518]  Uh, notes about other political issues and anything else I want to post that doesn't fit into those two organizations.
[03:56:06.518 --> 03:56:08.460]  Stahlman.org.
[03:56:08.460 --> 03:56:11.302]  Stahlman is the right place to read your writings and more research.
[03:56:11.302 --> 03:56:17.926]  Well, sir, next time we won't keep you for 50 minutes, but next time you'll come back on as things develop and unfold a few times a year.
[03:56:17.926 --> 03:56:20.568]  We'd like to get more reports from you, so I really appreciate you coming on.
[03:56:22.887 --> 03:56:24.128]  Okay, he is gone then.
[03:56:24.128 --> 03:56:25.388]  He took that as the cue to go.
[03:56:25.388 --> 03:56:31.451]  Let's bring up Ted Anderson because he is there with us at the end of the show here.
[03:56:31.451 --> 03:56:35.593]  Look, I got in my silver rounds, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:56:35.593 --> 03:56:36.534]  I already had a few of these.
[03:56:36.534 --> 03:56:38.395]  Everybody talks about how these are the prettiest
[03:56:38.695 --> 03:56:45.318]  If you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv or on the web later at PrisonPlanet.tv, these are the prettiest silver coins I've ever seen.
[03:56:45.318 --> 03:56:46.938]  They're sold out almost everywhere.
[03:56:46.938 --> 03:56:52.661]  Ted has a whole bunch of them, but it's almost sold out at the lower price before silver went up a few weeks ago.
[03:56:52.661 --> 03:56:53.321]  Look at these.
[03:56:53.321 --> 03:56:55.762]  Let's show folks a close shot of those.
[03:56:55.762 --> 03:56:57.723]  That's what I've got them there for.
[03:56:57.723 --> 03:57:02.765]  Look at these one-ounce silver coins, Lakota.
[03:57:02.765 --> 03:57:04.485]  Lakota Nation.
[03:57:04.485 --> 03:57:06.006]  And it is just gorgeous.
[03:57:06.006 --> 03:57:07.787]  It's really shiny, mirror image.
[03:57:09.148 --> 03:57:15.053]  Silver and on the back it
[03:57:17.694 --> 03:57:20.477]  It has a buffalo, as you can see right there.
[03:57:20.477 --> 03:57:22.879]  I mean, just look at this, folks.
[03:57:22.879 --> 03:57:26.902]  It doesn't get more gorgeous than this, and these things are going for $25 everywhere.
[03:57:26.902 --> 03:57:30.786]  Ted Anderson has them for $19, and you are not going to find a deal like that anywhere.
[03:57:30.786 --> 03:57:38.413]  Hey, Ted, I just wanted to bring you up right here at the very end of the show, because I finally have a bunch of these to show people, and you've got these in stock.
[03:57:38.413 --> 03:57:42.977]  Tell folks, because you buy a bunch of them, you pass on that wholesale discount to everybody, don't you, Ted?
[03:57:43.237 --> 03:57:43.957]  Yeah, sure do.
[03:57:43.957 --> 03:57:45.678]  And actually, they're $19.66.
[03:57:45.678 --> 03:57:48.720]  So, I mean, I don't want to make any confusion out there.
[03:57:48.720 --> 03:57:50.661]  But $19.66.
[03:57:50.661 --> 03:57:54.463]  But anyways, yeah, we did buy a whole bunch of them.
[03:57:54.463 --> 03:57:59.925]  And now, with silver where it is right now, they're going to be over the $20 range, even with me.
[03:57:59.925 --> 03:58:01.446]  So if you're interested, call us at 800-686-2237.
[03:58:01.446 --> 03:58:02.747]  It is a gorgeous coin.
[03:58:02.747 --> 03:58:04.007]  There's no question about it, Alex.
[03:58:07.902 --> 03:58:08.262]  Absolutely.
[03:58:08.262 --> 03:58:09.983]  In fact, guys, show them this stack over here again.
[03:58:09.983 --> 03:58:11.383]  I've never seen a silver coin like this.
[03:58:11.383 --> 03:58:17.585]  In fact, as good as they look on camera, you just really can't do justice to these bad boys.
[03:58:17.585 --> 03:58:23.708]  Ted Anderson, 800-686-2237.
[03:58:23.708 --> 03:58:24.428]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:24.428 --> 03:58:28.809]  Brokers will be there until midnight tonight to take advantage of that very low price while it lasts.
[03:58:28.809 --> 03:58:29.750]  Thank you, Ted.
[03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:30.630]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[03:58:31.030 --> 03:58:31.451]  You bet.
[03:58:31.451 --> 03:58:31.751]  Okay.

[03:58:51.866 --> 03:59:00.515]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[03:59:00.515 --> 03:59:05.360]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[03:59:05.360 --> 03:59:10.545]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.
