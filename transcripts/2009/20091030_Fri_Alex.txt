[00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:09.636]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.636 --> 00:00:11.216]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:12.137]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:16.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.022]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:43.413]  It's Friday, October 30th, 2009.
[00:00:43.413 --> 00:00:45.534]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:48.775]  We're going to be live, of course, for the full four hours today.
[00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:58.019]  We'll simulcast the last two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv and Living Color in the streaming live video for all the great members over there.
[00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.522]  We have our once-a-week visit with Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster coming up two hours from now.
[00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:09.127]  And we're going to have open phones and cover all of the important news and information in front of me.
[00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:15.835]  And you're welcome to call them with any news item or piece of news locally that didn't make the national news that you think is important.
[00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:17.917]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:17.977]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:43.102]  Before I go through the stack of news that I will later detail, what do you think of my idea to go ahead and draft Ron Paul to run for 2012 and to have him announced sooner rather than later so he can get the jump on all the other candidates and
[00:01:43.422 --> 00:01:58.798]  Start expanding the already giant in the Fed slash Tea Party movement against both parties and the private banking cartel that illegally and unlawfully and fraudulently rules this nation and much of the planet.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.904]  We'll also discuss the continued dropping in the dollar and what's happening with the stock market.
[00:02:05.904 --> 00:02:11.247]  We now have the 1,900-page health care bill.
[00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:15.229]  It is a consortium of the other five bills.
[00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.531]  It has all of the bad provisions.
[00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:24.175]  It has the public health forced option, the federal takeover of health care.
[00:02:24.175 --> 00:02:25.615]  It has the death panels.
[00:02:26.876 --> 00:02:27.757]  It's all there.
[00:02:27.757 --> 00:02:35.681]  By the minute news reports are coming out, analyzing different subsections of it, it is worse than even we thought it would be.
[00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:48.149]  Just like the climate tax, greenhouse gas tax, global government tax they passed in the House, set to pass in the Senate in the next month, unless a miracle happens, was worse than we even thought once we got a copy.
[00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:57.748]  No one got a copy until 10 minutes before the vote and Minority Leader Bonner out of Michigan sat there and did a rare house filibuster.
[00:02:57.748 --> 00:03:00.610]  Only a House leader can filibuster in the House.
[00:03:02.293 --> 00:03:04.094]  Senate filibuster is much stronger.
[00:03:04.094 --> 00:03:08.757]  And so he sat there reading subsection after subsection for approximately an hour.
[00:03:08.757 --> 00:03:10.138]  Same thing on this bad boy.
[00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:16.322]  They are just now bringing it out and then trying to force a vote very, very quickly on it when people have a lot of trouble reading it.
[00:03:16.322 --> 00:03:21.746]  But at least this time we will have some time to see the final bonafide bill.
[00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:26.689]  All 1,900 nightmare pages of it.
[00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.613]  So I would hope that you would want to pop in and give us your take on that as well today.
[00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.660]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.720]  800-259-9231.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.504]  And I have a bunch of other really important, big announcements today as well, so please stay with us for the transmission today or if you're busy at work.
[00:03:52.268 --> 00:03:52.508]  I don't
[00:04:11.286 --> 00:04:13.567]  Subscribe to every single day.
[00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:14.968]  That is continuing to grow.
[00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:16.748]  Very, very excited about the podcast.
[00:04:16.748 --> 00:04:22.631]  People can listen how they want, when they want, where they want and create their own archives or share it with others.
[00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:24.451]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:28.853]  Thank you.
[00:04:43.946 --> 00:04:51.257]  Over in England, city councils are banning parents being with their children in public unless they're government certified with a license.
[00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:57.085]  This is the beginning of removing all children from their parents and they're trying to launch similar programs here in the United States.
[00:04:57.085 --> 00:04:58.367]  This is world government.
[00:04:58.367 --> 00:04:59.027]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.663 --> 00:05:03.665]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.665 --> 00:05:08.990]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.051]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:16.055]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:16.976]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:18.337]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.337 --> 00:05:20.238]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.238 --> 00:05:21.299]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:23.500]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.841]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:26.382]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.382 --> 00:05:31.646]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.646 --> 00:05:35.228]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.228 --> 00:05:38.691]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:40.272]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:41.173]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:42.274]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.274 --> 00:05:43.194]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.194 --> 00:05:44.295]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.295 --> 00:05:47.358]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.358 --> 00:05:49.119]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:50.040]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:06.059]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:09.306]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:10.730]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.101]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.101 --> 00:06:20.483]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.483 --> 00:06:26.025]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:35.668]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:38.130]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.711]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:42.172]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.172 --> 00:06:44.294]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.294 --> 00:06:49.457]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.457 --> 00:07:00.864]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.864 --> 00:07:02.886]  When you hear the words water purification,
[00:07:05.387 --> 00:07:05.907]  We're good to go!
[00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:38.307]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.

[00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:53.980]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[00:08:01.903 --> 00:08:08.527]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.527 --> 00:08:15.271]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:19.213]  Paul, a Republican of Texas, he ran for president this past election.
[00:08:19.213 --> 00:08:21.214]  He's here to react to what we just heard.
[00:08:21.214 --> 00:08:26.197]  Concerning healthcare, Mr. Moore believes that universal healthcare is everyone's right.
[00:08:26.197 --> 00:08:29.239]  Threatens that the Democrats will lose seats if they don't support it.
[00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:30.920]  What's your stand on this, Congressman?
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.224]  I think it's a fallacy to say that people have a right to somebody else's services.
[00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:41.228]  You know, you have a right to your life, and you have a right to your liberty, and you have a right to earn a living.
[00:08:41.228 --> 00:08:45.051]  You ought to have a right to keep it, but you have a responsibility to take care of yourself.
[00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:53.377]  But you don't have a right to get something from government, because government has nothing, so government has to take it from somebody and give it to you.
[00:08:53.377 --> 00:08:54.798]  So it's a failed policy.
[00:08:54.798 --> 00:08:59.061]  It is, you know, a form of socialism, and socialism doesn't work.
[00:08:59.061 --> 00:09:01.183]  It leads to a big kind of problem.
[00:09:01.423 --> 00:09:09.509]  If you have no money and you fall down on the street with a heart attack, you have no money, no one should take care of you?
[00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:12.171]  The government should not provide an ambulance or treat you?
[00:09:12.171 --> 00:09:17.574]  No, but we don't have a history in this country of that happening even before government started managing health care.
[00:09:17.574 --> 00:09:21.657]  I practiced medicine in both circumstances in the early 60s.
[00:09:21.657 --> 00:09:23.499]  We didn't have managed care and I worked in a
[00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:25.019]  Catholic Hospital.
[00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:27.300]  I made $3 an hour and nobody was ever turned away.
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.560]  And there were many, many church hospitals.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.261]  And you had Shriner Hospitals and a lot of free care was given.
[00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:41.303]  Today, even with managed care, they complain about, oh, somebody doesn't have health insurance and somebody's going to die because they don't have health insurance.
[00:09:41.303 --> 00:09:43.164]  But really, people don't get turned away.
[00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:44.764]  I mean, accidents happen.
[00:09:44.764 --> 00:09:45.944]  Man's imperfect.
[00:09:45.944 --> 00:09:51.926]  But for the most part, anybody, including anybody illegal, can go to the emergency room and they always get taken care of.
[00:09:51.926 --> 00:09:53.526]  They just don't get thrown out in the street.
[00:09:53.886 --> 00:09:58.031]  Are you saying you like the current system?
[00:09:58.031 --> 00:10:02.976]  No, I probably dislike it as much as Michael Moore does.
[00:10:02.976 --> 00:10:06.600]  But he's complaining about it being part of capitalism.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.281]  It has nothing to do with capitalism.
[00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:09.563]  This is corporatism.
[00:10:09.563 --> 00:10:11.124]  The corporations, I agree with them.
[00:10:11.124 --> 00:10:12.225]  Corporations run things.
[00:10:12.225 --> 00:10:13.787]  The drug companies lobby us.
[00:10:13.787 --> 00:10:16.070]  The insurance companies lobby us.
[00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.693]  Okay, how do you change that?
[00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:33.452]  Yeah, free markets
[00:10:55.747 --> 00:10:57.889]  So the patients are leaving this country.
[00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:58.890]  They're going to India.
[00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.772]  But that's the market working.
[00:11:00.772 --> 00:11:04.876]  So we have put our charity hospitals out of business.
[00:11:04.876 --> 00:11:11.642]  At the same time, because of inflation and management and all the mischief of government, we have pushed these prices up.
[00:11:11.642 --> 00:11:15.666]  Pumping money into a system doesn't improve quality.
[00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:17.407]  It increases prices.
[00:11:17.407 --> 00:11:18.749]  Look at our educational system.
[00:11:18.749 --> 00:11:19.690]  We pump in money.
[00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:27.094]  Prices go up, the quality of education go up, and the quality of medicine has not gone up by just pumping more money into it.
[00:11:27.094 --> 00:11:33.798]  Lyndon Johnson once said, the probable answer is that a government's gonna have to be half capitalistic and half socialistic.
[00:11:33.798 --> 00:11:37.361]  You have to have some... Social Security is socialism.
[00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:40.042]  You have to take care of those who don't have.
[00:11:40.042 --> 00:11:41.763]  Pure capitalism can't work.
[00:11:41.763 --> 00:11:42.524]  Would you agree with that?
[00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:44.093]  No, not really.
[00:11:44.093 --> 00:11:46.234]  It's sort of like I practice OBGYN.
[00:11:46.234 --> 00:11:49.175]  I never could tell my patient they had a touch of pregnancy.
[00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:51.056]  And, you know, you're either pregnant or you're not.
[00:11:51.056 --> 00:11:55.218]  You either have government intervention messing up the markets, or you don't.
[00:11:55.218 --> 00:11:59.160]  You either believe in freedom and believe in voluntary choices.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.662]  I mean, just look at this disaster with the swine flu vaccine.
[00:12:03.803 --> 00:12:05.803]  They take over the whole project.
[00:12:05.803 --> 00:12:08.464]  We pump in billions of dollars.
[00:12:08.464 --> 00:12:10.865]  And they come up with shortages.
[00:12:10.865 --> 00:12:13.125]  The distribution is lousy.
[00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:17.666]  And they're talking about forcing people to take them in places like New York.
[00:12:17.666 --> 00:12:21.887]  And nobody's even proved that it's necessary yet.
[00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:27.148]  We have still a lot of deaths from ordinary flu, far surpassing swine flu.
[00:12:27.148 --> 00:12:31.269]  So man, if central economic planning in anything fails, and especially in medicine, it fails.
[00:12:32.096 --> 00:12:39.457]  But Congressman, everyone online getting it who's getting it free is not standing there complaining about government involvement.
[00:12:39.457 --> 00:12:49.139]  Yeah, but I have a daughter that practices medicine and I was talking to her about it and she said, oh yeah, Dad, I can give shots and it's for free, but we don't have anything.
[00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:52.280]  So when something is free and you don't have it, it's irrelevant.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.801]  And some of the people who don't want it are being forced to take it.
[00:12:56.801 --> 00:13:01.082]  We have lost our faith and confidence in understanding how free markets work.
[00:13:01.082 --> 00:13:01.742]  We turned it
[00:13:02.162 --> 00:13:08.184]  Upside down by saying anytime corporations get benefits we call it capitalism and freedom.
[00:13:08.184 --> 00:13:09.725]  And it's corporatism.
[00:13:09.725 --> 00:13:11.866]  It's the military-industrial complex.
[00:13:11.866 --> 00:13:13.586]  It's all the special interests.
[00:13:13.586 --> 00:13:15.827]  And this is where Michael Moore gets it all wrong.
[00:13:15.827 --> 00:13:20.989]  He works, he believes diligently in free markets because he believes in the First Amendment.
[00:13:20.989 --> 00:13:22.490]  He believes in making films.
[00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.951]  He doesn't believe in prior restraints.
[00:13:24.951 --> 00:13:27.612]  So why should he condemn capitalism?
[00:13:27.952 --> 00:13:32.374]  Because he calls, he's condemning corporatism.
[00:13:32.374 --> 00:13:33.174]  I condemn it too.
[00:13:33.174 --> 00:13:37.536]  Special privileges corporation is a big problem.
[00:13:37.536 --> 00:13:38.557]  Maybe it's semantics.
[00:13:38.557 --> 00:13:40.838]  More with Congressman Paul right after the break.
[00:13:40.838 --> 00:13:41.298]  Don't go away.
[00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:55.113]  I think capitalism as it's defined now has completely not only failed, well it hasn't really failed the rich.
[00:13:55.113 --> 00:14:03.180]  It's actually helped them, the wealthiest 1% now have more financial wealth than the bottom 95% combined.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.843]  So it's a really good system for a few people.
[00:14:09.981 --> 00:14:15.046]  Ron, do you disagree with that statistic that Michael Moore just pointed out?
[00:14:15.046 --> 00:14:29.520]  No, and I complain about it as much as he does, but I think I understand it differently because when a country embarks on deficit financing and inflationism, you wipe out the middle class and wealth is transferred from the middle class and the poor to the rich.
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:38.385]  And when we get into trouble, then the corporations, once again, who are in control, they come for their bailout, and then they get the benefits, and the little people don't.
[00:14:38.385 --> 00:14:43.728]  So yes, there is some truth to that, but it's the failure of the free market to exist.
[00:14:43.728 --> 00:14:45.049]  That is our problem.
[00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:46.630]  It isn't the fact that we don't have enough government.
[00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.291]  We have way too much government.
[00:14:48.291 --> 00:14:49.792]  The government created this monster.
[00:14:49.792 --> 00:14:54.175]  If he doesn't like what we have, he has to look at what we've been doing for thirty or four years.
[00:14:54.175 --> 00:14:55.896]  It's called interventionism.
[00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:57.236]  It's called Keynesianism.
[00:14:57.236 --> 00:14:58.817]  It's called inflationism.
[00:14:58.817 --> 00:14:59.838]  It's called re-government.
[00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.760]  That's the problem.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.022]  Here's what Michael Moore said about Afghanistan.
[00:15:05.022 --> 00:15:07.765]  I'll ask Congressman Paul what he thinks about the war there.
[00:15:07.765 --> 00:15:07.985]  Watch.
[00:15:08.905 --> 00:15:10.306]  Al Qaeda has left there.
[00:15:10.306 --> 00:15:12.687]  They booked out of the neighborhood, Larry.
[00:15:12.687 --> 00:15:14.188]  They're long gone, okay?
[00:15:14.188 --> 00:15:17.671]  They're in Pakistan, they're in parts of Africa, they're elsewhere in the Middle East.
[00:15:17.671 --> 00:15:19.432]  You know, they're here in the U.S.
[00:15:19.432 --> 00:15:29.378]  I mean, they're a real internet operation now, as Matthew Hull, this State Department individual who resigned last month over the Afghanistan policy.
[00:15:29.378 --> 00:15:32.800]  You should go online and read his letter of resignation.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.422]  You'll see he explains it very clearly, that
[00:15:35.842 --> 00:15:40.564]  The if we want to deal with Al Qaeda, the last place we need to be right now is in Afghanistan.
[00:15:40.564 --> 00:15:43.365]  That's just a crazy, crazy making place.
[00:15:43.365 --> 00:15:44.586]  It's unwinnable.
[00:15:44.586 --> 00:15:45.807]  It's immoral.
[00:15:45.807 --> 00:15:46.707]  It's illegal.
[00:15:46.707 --> 00:15:47.207]  It's wrong.
[00:15:47.207 --> 00:15:55.431]  And what is our CIA doing paying the brother of the president of Afghanistan who's involved in this opium trade that's funding the Taliban?
[00:15:55.431 --> 00:15:57.892]  I mean, where when does this stop?
[00:15:58.232 --> 00:16:01.674]  Congressman, you're a strong critic of Iraq.
[00:16:01.674 --> 00:16:04.436]  Are you a critic of the Afghanistan policy as well?
[00:16:04.436 --> 00:16:06.437]  Yeah, I sure am.
[00:16:06.437 --> 00:16:09.820]  My position is we shouldn't have gone in and we should just come home.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:16.644]  But earlier on, Michael was saying that he was hopeful and sympathetic to what Obama was doing.
[00:16:16.644 --> 00:16:22.428]  I don't think he's quite willing to criticize Obama like Bush, but I am.
[00:16:22.428 --> 00:16:23.428]  And yes,
[00:16:24.409 --> 00:16:27.991]  There have been a token effort of bringing some troops home from Iraq.
[00:16:27.991 --> 00:16:41.118]  Iraq is a mess, but at the same time, we're sending in contractors to replace the troops, paying them a lot more money, subsidizing the military-industrial complex, and Obama ought to be condemned for that.
[00:16:41.118 --> 00:16:43.179]  I wanted to play part of that interview.
[00:16:43.179 --> 00:16:47.181]  We've got it linked up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:49.703]  Headline, Ron Paul vs. Michael Moore.
[00:16:52.202 --> 00:16:56.565]  That's why he should be our president in 2012.
[00:16:56.565 --> 00:16:57.866]  He is the true populist.
[00:16:57.866 --> 00:17:00.047]  He is the true constitutionalist.
[00:17:00.047 --> 00:17:13.117]  He can succinctly, with the facts, as a degreed doctor and as an award-winning economist, and he's been on the banking committee forever, lay out what we're really facing and dealing with on the economy,
[00:17:13.928 --> 00:17:26.786]  With the private banking takeover, with the government takeover of healthcare, with all of it, he cuts right through the hypocrisy and points out that on the war front, Obama took 50,000 troops out of Iraq.
[00:17:29.892 --> 00:17:31.293]  When he'd been in office three months.
[00:17:31.293 --> 00:17:34.575]  Then he put 20,000 more combat troops back in.
[00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:36.416]  So that's a cut of 30.
[00:17:36.416 --> 00:17:41.319]  And then put 50,000 in, and contractors.
[00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:44.982]  So that's a 20,000 troop increase.
[00:17:44.982 --> 00:17:47.223]  And I've been using the number 50 for Iraq.
[00:17:47.223 --> 00:17:53.147]  I was just reading some numbers last night that they've actually put in another 10,000 contractors on top of the 50, and another 10,000 troops.
[00:17:53.147 --> 00:17:53.487]  So total,
[00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:02.492]  Pretty soon there are going to be up to 100,000 more people in Iraq than were there.
[00:18:02.492 --> 00:18:06.593]  There are 300,000 international U.S.
[00:18:06.593 --> 00:18:10.014]  and Afghan troops inside Afghanistan.
[00:18:10.014 --> 00:18:18.716]  300,000, according to the Pentagon, outnumbering the so-called Taliban, that's anybody that grows opium and doesn't pay their cut to the CIA and the big U.S.
[00:18:18.716 --> 00:18:22.477]  banks and British banks, 12 to 1.
[00:18:25.191 --> 00:18:37.440]  And Obama has put more than 40,000 more US troops into Afghanistan in the last 10 months, but the media has made the whole spectacle about, will he put 48,000 more in?
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.603]  Will he have this giant escalation when he's already escalated?
[00:18:41.603 --> 00:18:43.824]  And he's put more contractors into Afghanistan.
[00:18:43.824 --> 00:18:54.332]  I mean, this guy is expanding both the wars, going into Pakistan, a new war, with drone attacks three or four times a week, killing people, stirring up the natives.
[00:18:55.973 --> 00:19:05.602]  And then right out in the open, the New York Times and everybody else reports, oh yeah, the number one opium producer is the brother of Mohammed Karzai.
[00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:14.592]  And our government is helping grow the majority of the opium.
[00:19:14.592 --> 00:19:17.434]  Just right out in the open, they just throw it out there.
[00:19:17.434 --> 00:19:21.116]  Decades ago, they would deny that our government was involved in narcotics trafficking.
[00:19:21.116 --> 00:19:27.459]  Now they just kind of admit it in a sideways way and just go, that's just the way it is.
[00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:32.802]  But see, under Ron Paul, we decriminalize opium, like several European countries have done, and drug use
[00:19:34.005 --> 00:19:38.289]  Of opiates, it goes down by more than 50% within a couple years.
[00:19:38.289 --> 00:19:47.556]  Because all the money leaves it and then there's no reason for there to be dealers everywhere pushing it because there's not a lot of money in it.
[00:19:47.556 --> 00:19:58.725]  But then we wouldn't have this military industrial complex setting up a domestic police state under the smokescreen of the drug war and building all these private prisons that are owned by the big banks that launder the drug money.
[00:20:01.229 --> 00:20:08.751]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:20:08.751 --> 00:20:13.253]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:18.414]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[00:20:18.414 --> 00:20:25.877]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:20:25.877 --> 00:20:30.238]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[00:20:30.558 --> 00:20:36.581]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:20:36.581 --> 00:20:43.523]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[00:21:03.364 --> 00:21:03.704]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.704 --> 00:21:08.747]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.747 --> 00:21:10.367]  You should use Startpage instead.

[00:21:11.128 --> 00:21:11.528]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.528 --> 00:21:12.629]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.629 --> 00:21:15.590]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.

[00:21:30.979 --> 00:21:32.340]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.202]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.202 --> 00:21:39.985]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:22:00.248 --> 00:22:06.932]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:06.932 --> 00:22:15.056]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.056 --> 00:22:22.880]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:28.304]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.304 --> 00:22:33.529]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:37.872]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:37.872 --> 00:22:38.973]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:38.973 --> 00:22:42.997]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:43.457 --> 00:22:48.363]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:48.363 --> 00:22:51.367]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:51.367 --> 00:22:53.129]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.129 --> 00:22:53.370]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.497 --> 00:23:03.280]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:13.426]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:20.711]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[00:23:20.711 --> 00:23:26.355]  Doctors who have tried heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results as well.
[00:23:26.355 --> 00:23:29.197]  Here's what Dr. Goodman has to say about his experience
[00:23:29.777 --> 00:23:35.360]  If you notice that most times there are these drug ads on TV, they have a list of possible side effects.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:42.324]  I find that if you're going to take something that is, you're trading one problem for five or six other problems, that to me doesn't make sense.
[00:23:42.324 --> 00:23:48.827]  Using something that is natural, that is absorbed into the body, particularly because it's in a liquid form, I think is the best way to go.
[00:24:14.727 --> 00:24:20.091]  Look, I'm just going to go ahead and go to your phone calls right now, then I'm getting into the 1,900 page health care bill.
[00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:20.772]  It has it all.
[00:24:20.772 --> 00:24:27.456]  The public option, the death panels, the penalties on not getting insurance.
[00:24:28.427 --> 00:24:30.648]  The liability protection for the insurance companies.
[00:24:30.648 --> 00:24:31.929]  They wrote the bill.
[00:24:31.929 --> 00:24:33.970]  They brag in public statements.
[00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:41.354]  Meanwhile, when Pelosi got called a Nazi yesterday in her press conference, she said, thank you insurance companies and giggled.
[00:24:41.354 --> 00:24:47.478]  Knowing that her moron followers would believe it.
[00:24:47.478 --> 00:24:55.903]  There's also a Times of London article where a top pro greenhouse gas emission weather
[00:24:57.509 --> 00:25:05.451]  Climate change advocate admits that they've been lying and exaggerating what's happening to the planet, so that's discrediting them.
[00:25:05.451 --> 00:25:16.553]  And they show on there, as one example, a picture of the Arctic, the northern ice cap of the planet that sits above Russia and the United States and Canada.
[00:25:16.553 --> 00:25:26.335]  And how they, for school children and on national news for the childlike public, show photos of the Arctic in the winter.
[00:25:28.012 --> 00:25:38.874]  From the 1970s, and then they show photos of the Arctic in the summer from 2008 and say, look, it's a lot smaller!
[00:25:38.874 --> 00:25:40.814]  And from the 70s, it's almost melted.
[00:25:40.814 --> 00:25:45.515]  They don't tell you that that's normal and that it expands in the winter.
[00:25:45.515 --> 00:25:56.057]  It's those type of parlor shop tricks akin to something you'd see in an old-fashioned carnival with a con artist or a magician.
[00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:07.476]  I saw a few weeks ago Bill Maher's show on HBO and he showed a dust storm in Australia.
[00:26:07.476 --> 00:26:13.741]  Red dust in the air that blows in from the central part of the country that's desert.
[00:26:13.741 --> 00:26:19.845]  And I've read a lot of books about Australia and the pioneers and the convicts that were dropped off there by the British ships.
[00:26:21.055 --> 00:26:25.536]  The slave colonies they had and all the descriptions of the dust storms that blew through every year.
[00:26:25.536 --> 00:26:27.337]  Doesn't matter.
[00:26:27.337 --> 00:26:29.338]  He just says, look, the end of the world.
[00:26:29.338 --> 00:26:30.858]  This is global warming.
[00:26:30.858 --> 00:26:37.600]  This is what our planet will look like if we don't pass all these greenhouse laws.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.021]  And they show you a polar bear out on an ice floe and say, oh, look, he can't swim.
[00:26:41.021 --> 00:26:42.262]  He's stranded.
[00:26:42.262 --> 00:26:44.142]  The ice broke off and he's going to die.
[00:26:44.142 --> 00:26:46.483]  They don't tell you it's out there hunting seals.
[00:26:48.257 --> 00:26:54.919]  Or that it's normal every spring and summer for upwards of 30% of the Arctic and Antarctic to break off and float around.
[00:26:54.919 --> 00:26:56.239]  There's always been icebergs.
[00:26:56.239 --> 00:27:04.521]  The news will show a big 20 mile wide iceberg floating around and say, look at this giant iceberg!
[00:27:04.521 --> 00:27:06.181]  Ships are going to hit it.
[00:27:06.181 --> 00:27:08.422]  The whole Arctic and Antarctic are breaking off.
[00:27:08.422 --> 00:27:09.202]  There's always been.
[00:27:10.959 --> 00:27:15.501]  Icebergs in the north and south, floating around, endangering shipping.
[00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:16.642]  It always happens.
[00:27:16.642 --> 00:27:21.684]  But they can show people a photo of it during the summer and say, look, it's melting.
[00:27:21.684 --> 00:27:24.486]  They don't show you a winter photograph, but it expands.
[00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:30.689]  We've played on the TV show here for viewers and posted on InfoWars and Prison Planet many times.
[00:27:30.689 --> 00:27:36.412]  Satellite time lapses, where they've taken satellite photos and put them together over the last 30 years.
[00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:42.258]  The ice caps get big in the winter, small in the summer.
[00:27:42.258 --> 00:27:45.240]  And they grow and contract, grow and contract.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.501]  They grow and shrink.
[00:27:47.501 --> 00:27:48.962]  Polar bears can swim.
[00:27:48.962 --> 00:27:49.843]  They like to swim.
[00:27:49.843 --> 00:27:50.723]  Strongest land swimmer.
[00:27:50.723 --> 00:27:52.124]  And I know I talk about this a lot.
[00:27:52.124 --> 00:27:59.530]  It's just, it's so incredible to have the government admit they grow the opium and ship it into the country.
[00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.612]  And they're still gonna put you in prison if you're dumb enough to be caught with it.
[00:28:02.612 --> 00:28:06.574]  Unless you're Rush Limbaugh taking a synthetic opium and then it's okay.
[00:28:06.574 --> 00:28:07.075]  Oxycontin.
[00:28:08.447 --> 00:28:12.671]  He still says put anybody caught with cocaine or heroin in prison.
[00:28:12.671 --> 00:28:15.253]  Five year, ten year sentence is first offense.
[00:28:15.253 --> 00:28:18.916]  But he's okay taking 100 Oxycontin a day.
[00:28:18.916 --> 00:28:22.539]  See, I understand the guy did hurt his back and got addicted.
[00:28:22.539 --> 00:28:23.840]  And I feel sorry for him.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:29.065]  Except that he's a big fat disgusting hypocrite and makes me want to throw up.
[00:28:29.065 --> 00:28:35.110]  I don't judge Rush Limbaugh for getting addicted to pain pills and going deaf from it.
[00:28:36.243 --> 00:28:39.245]  Literally ate his nerves in his middle ear.
[00:28:39.245 --> 00:28:43.027]  That's what it does.
[00:28:43.027 --> 00:28:54.574]  But I do blame him saying, if you're caught with illegal drugs, which their molecules are almost identical to the stuff he's taking, because it's a black market drug, you need to be thrown in prison.
[00:28:55.458 --> 00:29:04.041]  You see, the drug war makes it be a nasty business, makes it have prostitution and violence involved and huge profits for the gangbangers.
[00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:10.143]  And sure, the criminals will go find some other business if you decriminalize drugs.
[00:29:10.143 --> 00:29:11.424]  And I certainly don't like drugs.
[00:29:11.424 --> 00:29:14.385]  I don't like Ritalin, Prozac, heroin, cocaine.
[00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:15.725]  I don't like marijuana.
[00:29:15.725 --> 00:29:17.846]  The marijuana heads always get mad at me when I say that.
[00:29:19.642 --> 00:29:23.244]  Some people could smoke pot and get away with it, but a lot of people it ruins their lives.
[00:29:23.244 --> 00:29:26.786]  I know it has a lot of medical uses, but I am for decriminalizing it.
[00:29:26.786 --> 00:29:31.830]  But don't expect me to sit here and get on some bandwagon about how great marijuana is.
[00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:35.112]  And don't expect me to get up on a bandwagon about how great alcohol is.
[00:29:35.112 --> 00:29:38.434]  Alcohol ruins a lot of lives and screws up a lot of people.
[00:29:38.434 --> 00:29:39.895]  Can some people drink responsibly?
[00:29:39.895 --> 00:29:40.575]  Yes.
[00:29:40.575 --> 00:29:41.836]  Most people can't.
[00:29:41.836 --> 00:29:43.957]  Am I for decriminalizing alcohol?
[00:29:43.957 --> 00:29:46.118]  No, I don't want it to be illegal.
[00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:48.360]  Because alcoholism tripled during Prohibition.
[00:29:50.894 --> 00:29:52.295]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.295 --> 00:29:54.816]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.816 --> 00:30:00.218]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.218 --> 00:30:05.521]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:05.521 --> 00:30:10.043]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:10.043 --> 00:30:12.324]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:12.324 --> 00:30:13.944]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:13.944 --> 00:30:14.985]  There is a solution.
[00:30:15.225 --> 00:30:23.654]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:30:37.128 --> 00:30:43.153]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[00:31:00.216 --> 00:31:04.319]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:31:04.319 --> 00:31:07.200]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.461]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:31:08.461 --> 00:31:09.282]  It's very real.
[00:31:09.282 --> 00:31:11.523]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:31:11.523 --> 00:31:13.184]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:31:13.184 --> 00:31:17.647]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:32:00.543 --> 00:32:02.323]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:32:02.323 --> 00:32:03.824]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:32:03.824 --> 00:32:05.164]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:32:05.164 --> 00:32:07.105]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:32:07.105 --> 00:32:15.887]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:32:15.887 --> 00:32:21.309]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[00:32:21.309 --> 00:32:22.909]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[00:32:23.109 --> 00:32:30.592]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.

[00:33:01.943 --> 00:33:10.845]  Most people still today think that all entertainment to do with movies, drama, is therefore nothing more than their entertainment.
[00:33:10.845 --> 00:33:12.605]  It never ever was that case.
[00:33:12.605 --> 00:33:18.326]  Throughout history, social engineers have refined techniques designed to control large populations.
[00:33:18.326 --> 00:33:20.567]  It is bringing entertainment to thousands of people.
[00:33:21.427 --> 00:33:23.508]  Right in the comfort of our own homes.
[00:33:23.508 --> 00:33:28.088]  You're actually in an altered state, being completely downloaded with new ideas.
[00:33:28.088 --> 00:33:32.509]  A cult of personality can be manufactured to influence the masses.
[00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:34.310]  Nobody will question what he's doing.
[00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:39.011]  They'll be so preoccupied with where he is, or what he's wearing.
[00:33:39.011 --> 00:33:40.231]  Yes, we can!
[00:33:40.231 --> 00:33:42.511]  The idea of making him into a celebrity.
[00:33:42.511 --> 00:33:48.153]  Eventually, he said, they will expect the media to do all their thinking and reasoning for them.
[00:33:48.153 --> 00:33:49.033]  That's happened today.
[00:33:49.893 --> 00:33:55.510]  The scientific dictatorship understands what makes human beings tick, and they're using it against us.
[00:33:56.505 --> 00:34:01.486]  These cells are scanned by a stream of electrons, completing 30 pictures a second.
[00:34:01.486 --> 00:34:07.728]  It's hard for people like that to take a serious interest in what their elected officials are doing.
[00:34:07.728 --> 00:34:08.888]  They've been programmed.
[00:34:08.888 --> 00:34:12.629]  It's Obama's role to front for the International Banking Syndicate.
[00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:16.149]  Barack Obama is a puppet of the New World Order.
[00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:17.570]  Is this some sort of New World Order?
[00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.330]  The New World Order is emerging.
[00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.931]  For the first time in history, we really have this new form of an empire.
[00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.173]  The average man and woman is in a trance.
[00:34:26.173 --> 00:34:27.615]  They get home from work.
[00:34:27.615 --> 00:34:29.297]  They don't even talk to their children.
[00:34:29.297 --> 00:34:31.260]  They turn the television on.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:36.186]  And they let those corporate messages set the agenda in their lives.
[00:34:36.186 --> 00:34:37.828]  You've got time to watch baseball.
[00:34:37.828 --> 00:34:39.530]  You've got time to entertain yourself.
[00:34:40.271 --> 00:34:43.214]  What a knowledgeable public we're losing.
[00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:47.177]  Kill your television, or at least turn it off a few hours a day.
[00:34:47.177 --> 00:34:49.960]  The children aren't even playing in your front yards anymore.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:35:00.550]  We don't want to live under a world government of the corporations, by the corporations, and for the corporations.
[00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:01.831]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:35:03.973 --> 00:35:05.894]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:05.894 --> 00:35:06.815]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:35:06.815 --> 00:35:14.321]  I want to go over this article Paul Watson wrote, and we're going directly to Frank, Karen, Daniel, Sam, James, and others.
[00:35:14.321 --> 00:35:15.602]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:35:30.325 --> 00:35:35.709]  Millions of people worldwide take the red pill and choose to awaken.
[00:35:35.709 --> 00:35:39.272]  Paul Joseph Watson, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com.
[00:35:39.272 --> 00:35:41.534]  This is a call to action.
[00:35:41.534 --> 00:35:54.864]  I am requesting that all of our wonderful activist listeners take action and email this article that has embedded in it, Follow the Republic, in its entirety, in decent quality, for free.
[00:35:56.837 --> 00:35:59.658]  The best end code we found is, again, the director's channel.
[00:35:59.658 --> 00:36:03.059]  Change the channel on YouTube.
[00:36:03.059 --> 00:36:08.741]  The entire two-hour, 24-minute film is free.
[00:36:08.741 --> 00:36:11.201]  Please, this is not Pearls Before Swine.
[00:36:11.201 --> 00:36:16.363]  This film cost me $200,000 and a lot of blood, sweat, and tears to produce.
[00:36:18.089 --> 00:36:21.330]  It is the most powerful documentary I have ever made.
[00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:24.370]  Let me read this article from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:44.914]  Fall of the Republic has exploded onto the internet as millions of people worldwide take the red pill in the first week since its release and discover the antidote to the establishment's lies about what caused the financial collapse and their agenda to deceptively claim that empowering the very culprits of the crime will solve the problem.
[00:36:44.914 --> 00:36:45.594]  As America
[00:36:46.678 --> 00:36:51.039]  is frog marched into a tyrannical system of world government.
[00:36:51.039 --> 00:37:06.723]  The consequences of the Obama deception receiving tens of millions of views earlier this year and growing manifested in the form of a key contribution to the burgeoning grassroots resistance that has dominated 2009.
[00:37:08.931 --> 00:37:19.480]  A nationwide movement against the big government agenda, as the globalists attempt to use their new front man, Barack Hussein Obama, to rapidly accelerate their new world order.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:26.185]  Now we are calling on you, the info warrior, to help us make Fall of the Republic go viral.
[00:37:26.185 --> 00:37:28.507]  It already has gone viral, but mega viral.
[00:37:28.507 --> 00:37:31.870]  And in doing so, dismantle the contrived perception
[00:37:33.188 --> 00:37:47.720]  That only by surrendering to nightmare levels of regulation and centralized control, bossed by an ultra-powerful architecture of global government, will we avoid another Great Depression.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:55.426]  Fall of the Republic has the potential to outstrip even the Obama deception in reaching millions more people.
[00:37:56.454 --> 00:38:05.438]  And early indications, just over a week after the film was released, are that this is indeed happening and greater than we even expected.
[00:38:05.438 --> 00:38:11.721]  The YouTube version below has already received over 300,000 views of over 1,000 versions up there.
[00:38:11.721 --> 00:38:13.802]  It's over 2 million views.
[00:38:13.802 --> 00:38:23.166]  The YouTube version below has already received over 300,000 views, and this is just one of thousands of different versions that are floating around the web, full of the Republic
[00:38:23.959 --> 00:38:30.824]  We'll be devastating for the globalists and their agenda to impose a world economic order and a cap-and-trade scam.
[00:38:30.824 --> 00:38:35.628]  But only if you play your part in getting this information out to the world.
[00:38:35.628 --> 00:38:41.813]  The film has already unlocked minds on a massive scale and is smashing the phony left-right control system.
[00:38:43.803 --> 00:38:52.049]  We have chosen to publicize and encourage the circulation of the following version because it is encoded in the highest possible quality that YouTube allows.
[00:38:52.049 --> 00:38:54.631]  Still nothing compared to PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:38:54.631 --> 00:38:59.635]  And the full video is all in one place rather than being broken up into different chunks.
[00:38:59.635 --> 00:39:04.779]  Please grab the following link and spread it to the four corners of the internet.
[00:39:04.779 --> 00:39:09.202]  In allegorical terms, this simple URL
[00:39:10.379 --> 00:39:22.363]  represents a devastating virus that can infect the mainframe operating system of the New World Order technological enslavement system.
[00:39:22.363 --> 00:39:27.285]  Fall of the Republic, in full, is embedded below.
[00:39:30.359 --> 00:39:32.560]  This is a call to action.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:42.165]  The battle plan for getting Fall of the Republic out to as many people as possible comprises the following forms of activism.
[00:39:42.165 --> 00:39:45.347]  Here is your mission if you choose to accept it.
[00:39:45.347 --> 00:39:54.712]  Create your own video review of Fall of the Republic and post it on YouTube pointing people to where they can view the film for free.
[00:39:54.712 --> 00:39:59.295]  And there's a particular video that's gotten more than 12,000 views in the last day that we linked to.
[00:40:01.084 --> 00:40:03.586]  In fact, I'm going to ask Paul to add that here as an example.
[00:40:03.586 --> 00:40:16.277]  Where he has the computer screen, the room is dark, the computer screen to the side of him, and he plays a short clip of what he thinks is the best and most informative part of the film as a teaser, then he comments on it and then reviews the film.
[00:40:16.277 --> 00:40:20.060]  Very effective.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:25.485]  Create your own video review of Fall of the Republic and post it to YouTube, pointing people to where they can view the film for free.
[00:40:26.789 --> 00:40:31.372]  Call into Talk Radio and tell people they can watch Fall of the Republic free on YouTube.
[00:40:31.372 --> 00:40:34.094]  Get the DVD and make copies.
[00:40:34.094 --> 00:40:35.855]  Hand them out in your local community.
[00:40:35.855 --> 00:40:45.222]  And that is so important because I didn't really expect during the civil emergency that I told you four months ago Obama was going to declare over flu, because the UN said he was going to.
[00:40:46.042 --> 00:40:53.431]  I didn't really expect the White House and Homeland Security to openly say, we may shut down the web and only allow you to go to our sites.
[00:40:53.431 --> 00:40:55.493]  But that's now in the Associated Press and Reuters.
[00:40:55.493 --> 00:40:57.956]  That doesn't mean they're going to do that, but they may.
[00:40:57.956 --> 00:40:59.418]  They're more bold than I thought.
[00:41:01.357 --> 00:41:06.019]  But they're certainly breaking the ice and testing the waters and selling that idea.
[00:41:06.019 --> 00:41:13.463]  That during emergencies they're going to shut... And folks, the UN now controls, along with DARPA, the ICANN registry.
[00:41:13.463 --> 00:41:18.306]  They can shut down the entire web and only let you go to one site if they want and redirect everything there.
[00:41:19.468 --> 00:41:22.369]  This is stated fact, and they're now saying they may do this.
[00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:31.650]  You know, four or five months ago, his Cybersecurity Act, now in the Senate, they stated in the headlines, Obama takes over the Internet for the safety of the Internet.
[00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:34.391]  During emergencies, they may take over the web.
[00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:40.532]  I mean, you better get the DVD and make copies of it, because that's low-tech.
[00:41:40.532 --> 00:41:43.713]  It's the highest quality, but low-tech, they can't stop you from getting it out that way.
[00:41:46.363 --> 00:41:58.815]  We did the whole Obama Joker operation as an example of what just this activist audience could do, printing up Obama Socialist, Obama Fascist, ObamaInfoWars.com.
[00:41:58.815 --> 00:42:00.277]  People say, why is it fascist or socialist?
[00:42:00.277 --> 00:42:04.320]  It's all command and control, depending on your perspective, whether he's socialist or fascist.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.563]  It's all different varieties of the same creature.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:13.882]  And it was on hundreds of TV stations, national TV, Japanese TV, German, British.
[00:42:13.882 --> 00:42:14.422]  It was huge.
[00:42:14.422 --> 00:42:15.103]  You saw it all.
[00:42:15.103 --> 00:42:19.744]  I mean, there were scores of TV and newspaper articles every day.
[00:42:19.744 --> 00:42:25.147]  And then they would demonize people putting them up, and so people rebelled and put even more up, and they finally had to back down.
[00:42:25.147 --> 00:42:25.927]  You can do that.
[00:42:25.927 --> 00:42:28.808]  If they shut the web off, you can just print up flyers.
[00:42:28.808 --> 00:42:30.128]  It's devastating.
[00:42:30.128 --> 00:42:33.770]  I mean, the more they shut things down, the more people are going to seek out your information.
[00:42:35.475 --> 00:42:39.338]  And I've been doing all of this to show you your power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:39.338 --> 00:42:42.360]  The solution is not Alex Jones or even Ron Paul.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:48.944]  The solution is you standing up.
[00:42:48.944 --> 00:42:54.428]  Alright, let me finish the article and I'm going directly to your calls.
[00:42:54.428 --> 00:43:00.332]  Create your own video review of Fall of the Republic and post it to YouTube, pointing people to where they can view the film for free.
[00:43:00.332 --> 00:43:03.895]  Call into Talk Radio and tell people that they can watch Fall of the Republic free on YouTube.
[00:43:04.855 --> 00:43:07.717]  Get the DVD and make copies, hand them out in your local community.
[00:43:07.717 --> 00:43:18.266]  Download the high-quality DIVX version at PrisonPlanet.tv and make CD copies that are playable on DVD players and in computers and hand them out in your neighborhood.
[00:43:18.266 --> 00:43:20.688]  Send the YouTube link out to your email list.
[00:43:20.688 --> 00:43:24.872]  Post it on forums and bulletin boards across the web.
[00:43:24.872 --> 00:43:29.936]  Hold DVD viewing parties and invite neighbors around to watch the film.
[00:43:29.936 --> 00:43:33.099]  Rent local cinema screens and broadcast the movie for free.
[00:43:36.027 --> 00:43:44.415]  Some would suggest that we are undercutting our own operation in publicizing where people can watch Fall of the Republic in its entirety for free.
[00:43:44.415 --> 00:43:59.329]  The entire project behind producing the film cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, but the information contained in the movie is so important to communicate and the times are so perilous, it's all happening right now, the New World Order takeover is happening right now, that we want as many people to see this documentary as possible.
[00:43:59.329 --> 00:44:01.611]  Whether they pay for it or not, this is not
[00:44:02.836 --> 00:44:08.786]  Our mission to make money, our mission is to get the word out, make enough money to continue and expand our operation.
[00:44:08.786 --> 00:44:16.638]  We're able to do that thanks to the PrisonPlanet.tv members and people that do buy the DVDs and our radio sponsors and I want to thank you as being our partners in this.
[00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:39.161]  However, we do need your support to allow us to continue to expose the globalists, and this is why we ask those who can afford to, to buy the DVD and make copies or subscribe to presentplanet.tv, $5.95 a month, the cost of two cups of coffee, where you can watch all of my films in high quality, as well as access daily archives of the live radio show and the live TV show.
[00:44:39.161 --> 00:44:43.924]  You can also watch live streaming video of the TV show as well, simulcasting with the radio.
[00:44:45.868 --> 00:44:52.574]  Then we have what people are saying about Fall of the Republic under that and a final call to action.
[00:44:52.574 --> 00:44:57.738]  A super high quality version comparatively for YouTube.
[00:44:57.738 --> 00:44:59.660]  It's very good in code.
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.382]  This particular director channel does with it.
[00:45:01.382 --> 00:45:01.862]  That's great.
[00:45:01.862 --> 00:45:04.124]  We don't even know how to upload stuff this good to YouTube.
[00:45:04.124 --> 00:45:11.611]  It's a real art form of how you upload it and how you do it and how your pixels are compressed by their system.
[00:45:13.874 --> 00:45:19.276]  It's super high quality at PrisonPlanet.TV, but regardless, this is a really good copy.
[00:45:19.276 --> 00:45:21.016]  It changed the channel.
[00:45:21.016 --> 00:45:25.217]  And there are some other channels that even have more views and it isn't that high quality, but that's fine.
[00:45:25.217 --> 00:45:26.758]  The point is, this is the link.
[00:45:26.758 --> 00:45:27.758]  This is the link we need.
[00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:30.019]  I want 10 million views in a month.
[00:45:31.673 --> 00:45:37.239]  I don't want $4,100,000 like the Change the Channel version has for Obama deception right now.
[00:45:37.239 --> 00:45:38.861]  I want $10,000,000.
[00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:39.662]  And you can do that.
[00:45:39.662 --> 00:45:43.246]  If you pay it forward, send the link out, tell everyone about it.
[00:45:43.246 --> 00:45:45.028]  Please take action.
[00:45:45.028 --> 00:45:46.049]  Go get this article.
[00:45:46.049 --> 00:45:46.890]  Follow the Republic.
[00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:48.392]  Millions of people worldwide.
[00:45:48.392 --> 00:45:49.353]  Take the red pill.
[00:45:52.026 --> 00:45:54.268]  And get it out to everyone with the embedded video.
[00:45:54.268 --> 00:45:55.748]  Please take action.
[00:45:55.748 --> 00:45:57.229]  I want to see this explode.
[00:45:57.229 --> 00:46:07.136]  You've seen the power of the Obama deception, the power of Endgame, the power of Terror Storm, the power of Truth Rising, the power of Loose Change Final Cut that I produced.
[00:46:07.896 --> 00:46:12.638]  Now let's see the power of Fall of the Republic, the power of the people.
[00:46:12.638 --> 00:46:14.158]  This is my greatest work.
[00:46:14.158 --> 00:46:28.023]  It is a weapon, a sword of truth forged in the furnaces as I stood over it with hammer and tongs slamming through the night with the sparks flying to create this weapon, the greatest weapon I've ever created against the globalists.
[00:46:28.023 --> 00:46:32.005]  And now I give this to you to wield on the fields of battle.
[00:46:32.935 --> 00:46:39.019]  Like Vulcan, I stand in the volcano's mouth, hammering the next sword.
[00:46:39.019 --> 00:46:44.442]  But, who knows what my destiny is if we'll release the next film, if I'll be here next month.
[00:46:44.442 --> 00:46:46.584]  I pray I will and I hope I will.
[00:46:46.584 --> 00:46:55.169]  But this weapon is now released and is now part of history and part of destiny.
[00:46:55.169 --> 00:46:57.671]  Let's go ahead and talk to Frank in Florida.
[00:46:57.671 --> 00:46:58.652]  Frank, you're on the air.
[00:46:58.652 --> 00:47:01.914]  Yes, Alex, can you hear me?
[00:47:01.914 --> 00:47:02.274]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:03.132 --> 00:47:07.215]  Okay, my question goes back to the topic of children.
[00:47:07.215 --> 00:47:21.547]  What is your opinion about the idea of a newlywed couple birthing their kid in their home and hiding it from society, which means no shot in the hospital, no SS card, no public school, etc.
[00:47:21.547 --> 00:47:23.409]  Is anyone doing this?
[00:47:23.409 --> 00:47:29.354]  It's just an idea and I was wondering what your opinion was for people who have their first children.
[00:47:29.354 --> 00:47:30.735]  Well, I mean, you kind of put it like
[00:47:32.077 --> 00:47:45.761]  Like, they're hiding them in a cage, and no, I'm not for that, but there are millions of people every year now with midwives and with nurses, and if they rarely need to, they go to the doctor if there's any problem.
[00:47:45.761 --> 00:47:49.282]  That's the way we were all born until the last 60 years ago.
[00:47:49.282 --> 00:47:59.925]  You know, my great-grandmother, Mamaw Jones, had seven children, and they were all born at home.
[00:48:01.536 --> 00:48:04.759]  And every once in a while, the doctor needed to be called.
[00:48:04.759 --> 00:48:06.500]  He could ride a horse over or drive over.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:09.523]  They're in Teague, Texas.
[00:48:09.523 --> 00:48:26.998]  But absolutely, I mean, I have people working in my office who've had multiple people that work in my office who've had their children at home and have had less complications than my wife, who we've had all our children in the hospital.
[00:48:26.998 --> 00:48:29.080]  And that's the bottom line.
[00:48:30.186 --> 00:48:33.289]  And it's not hiding them from society to not give them cancer viruses.
[00:48:33.289 --> 00:48:35.331]  I mean, the German army won't take them.
[00:48:35.331 --> 00:48:37.312]  Won't take the flu shot.
[00:48:37.312 --> 00:48:42.257]  But I think people should have a top midwife there.
[00:48:42.257 --> 00:48:44.759]  I mean, it's their choice to make.
[00:48:44.759 --> 00:48:48.062]  I've chosen to have children in the hospital because I knew the doctor.
[00:48:48.062 --> 00:48:48.542]  And still,
[00:48:49.434 --> 00:48:56.039]  You know, the induction nurse, the head nurse every time, sits there and asks my wife questions about, do we have money?
[00:48:56.039 --> 00:48:57.501]  Am I mean to her?
[00:48:57.501 --> 00:49:03.886]  You know, they're not saying you're in a police interview, not saying you have a right to remain silent.
[00:49:03.886 --> 00:49:08.269]  You know, the nurse still sits there praying on us, but we know that and just laugh at her.
[00:49:08.269 --> 00:49:09.790]  But that's how America operates.
[00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:11.512]  But you make the decision for yourself.
[00:49:12.568 --> 00:49:17.775]  So it's okay to just totally ignore the school thing and homeschool them the way I want?
[00:49:17.775 --> 00:49:19.397]  Well, I mean, it's okay.
[00:49:19.397 --> 00:49:20.880]  I mean, my... one of my uncles...
[00:49:22.808 --> 00:49:23.388]  I don't
[00:49:43.397 --> 00:49:43.777]  I don't know.
[00:49:59.156 --> 00:50:09.902]  Andrew Jackson was raised at home, and Abraham Lincoln was raised at home, and just like George Washington was raised at home, and Thomas Jefferson was raised at home, and Benjamin Franklin was raised at home.
[00:50:09.902 --> 00:50:17.106]  And then, once they've learned reading, writing, and arithmetic, and science, once they've been given the desire and the love affair with reading,
[00:50:17.506 --> 00:50:27.349]  They are then, at 12 or 13, sent to be an apprentice of a lawyer, or a blacksmith, or a silversmith, or a doctor, or a barber, or a writer.
[00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:30.230]  That's what built this country.
[00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:31.731]  Not government education.
[00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:37.272]  The more money you put into education, the more you drive up the price and down everybody down.
[00:50:37.272 --> 00:50:38.473]  It's a fact.
[00:50:38.473 --> 00:50:40.473]  And the establishment knows this.
[00:50:40.473 --> 00:50:42.314]  Does that answer your question?
[00:50:42.314 --> 00:50:43.734]  Yes sir, thank you.
[00:50:43.734 --> 00:50:45.295]  Thank you so much, I appreciate your call.
[00:50:47.182 --> 00:50:57.726]  Now homeschooling is not for everybody, but they plan to bankrupt society so you're forced to put your children in school and then after school programs and 12 months a year so that the state raises your children.
[00:50:57.726 --> 00:50:59.447]  This is stated in thousands of textbooks.
[00:51:00.712 --> 00:51:08.455]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[00:51:08.455 --> 00:51:17.038]  AirAndAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[00:51:17.038 --> 00:51:21.800]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:25.481]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[00:51:25.481 --> 00:51:29.843]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:51:30.103 --> 00:51:30.583]  I think so.
[00:52:01.807 --> 00:52:05.833]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.833 --> 00:52:09.077]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.077 --> 00:52:10.499]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:11.404 --> 00:52:13.865]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.865 --> 00:52:20.267]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.267 --> 00:52:25.449]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.449 --> 00:52:28.710]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:35.432]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.552 --> 00:52:37.914]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:37.914 --> 00:52:39.495]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.495 --> 00:52:41.957]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.957 --> 00:52:43.819]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:43.819 --> 00:52:49.243]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.243 --> 00:52:58.350]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:53:05.943 --> 00:53:10.845]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[00:53:10.845 --> 00:53:15.867]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.

[00:54:07.925 --> 00:54:14.207]  The so-called death panel measure survives in the House bill, and the public government takeover option as well.
[00:54:14.207 --> 00:54:22.749]  This 1,900-page abomination is worse than we even first thought when analyzing the five bills that have now been integrated into this nightmare.
[00:54:22.749 --> 00:54:27.870]  The insurance companies wrote the bill, contrary to controlled left lies.
[00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:30.651]  Let's go ahead and talk to Karen in Oregon.
[00:54:30.651 --> 00:54:31.591]  Karen, thanks for holding.
[00:54:32.577 --> 00:54:39.261]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call and thank you for everything you do to help the rest of us wake up.
[00:54:39.261 --> 00:54:40.442]  It's my mission, thank you.
[00:54:41.394 --> 00:54:49.257]  Well, I've called because I really believe, Alex, that we have to come together in order to stop this criminal dominant minority.
[00:54:49.257 --> 00:54:52.037]  And that's what I'm calling them from now on.
[00:54:52.037 --> 00:54:58.019]  Because the more I say that, I mean, it's true, they are the criminal dominant minority.
[00:54:58.019 --> 00:55:03.501]  And I believe that we can stop them with an economic boycott on the 15th of every month.
[00:55:03.501 --> 00:55:05.822]  Don't buy, don't comply, and ask why.
[00:55:06.702 --> 00:55:18.046]  I want to encourage people to not buy anything at all on the 15th of the month, and don't buy into official government-sponsored propaganda.
[00:55:18.046 --> 00:55:24.468]  Don't comply by rolling up their sleeves for the shot, and don't comply by keeping their money in the bank.
[00:55:24.468 --> 00:55:28.930]  Take your money out of the bank on the 15th of the month, and then ask why.
[00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:31.070]  Pick up the phone and call Congress.
[00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:34.972]  Ask them why they're not printing and valuing their money without interest and without debt.
[00:55:35.772 --> 00:55:44.361]  Bob Schultz from the We The People Foundation says that he believes an economic boycott is going to be necessary.
[00:55:44.361 --> 00:55:55.932]  I'm hoping that people will go to TaxHoliday2009.net and look over our plan and start supporting Bob Schultz who wants to restore the Constitution.
[00:55:56.954 --> 00:56:00.356]  And we've had Bob on, Karen, and I appreciate your call.
[00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:01.517]  All of this is important.
[00:56:01.517 --> 00:56:07.501]  Talking to people at the grocery store checkout line, talking to people at church, just getting the buzz of Liberty going.
[00:56:07.501 --> 00:56:12.865]  It's already a crescendo, but we need to intensify that and redouble that.
[00:56:12.865 --> 00:56:24.533]  But expanding on that, Karen, every time I send Aaron Dykes and Rob Dew or Rob Jacobson or Jason Douglas or other camera guys out to different parts of the country to do interviews,
[00:56:25.481 --> 00:56:30.864]  Or to show the collapse of Detroit, the fall of Detroit.
[00:56:30.864 --> 00:56:33.306]  The TSA asked, what are these cameras?
[00:56:33.306 --> 00:56:34.187]  And they say they're cameras.
[00:56:34.187 --> 00:56:35.007]  Well, what are they for?
[00:56:35.007 --> 00:56:37.889]  Well, we're... And they get in their face.
[00:56:37.889 --> 00:56:39.210]  And coming back out of Canada...
[00:56:40.265 --> 00:56:45.747]  They're going to be on the last 30 minutes of the show today, covering their police state adventures.
[00:56:45.747 --> 00:56:57.172]  They got held for three or four hours at the border until they could get a hold of us at the office, until we could dig out the original receipts for the two $5,500 cameras.
[00:56:57.172 --> 00:57:00.034]  They're not even that expensive of cameras.
[00:57:00.034 --> 00:57:03.795]  They're decent, high-def, pro-zoomer.
[00:57:03.795 --> 00:57:04.976]  A professional camera is like $20,000.
[00:57:04.976 --> 00:57:06.236]  These are pro-zoomer.
[00:57:11.414 --> 00:57:14.536]  They said, you've stolen these and we're going to basically arrest you.
[00:57:14.536 --> 00:57:18.818]  And they said, no, we crossed the border, we did interviews, we're back.
[00:57:18.818 --> 00:57:21.400]  And they said, you must see you're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.701]  They said, you may have stolen these.
[00:57:22.701 --> 00:57:24.101]  Are you looking for somebody who stole something?
[00:57:24.101 --> 00:57:25.762]  They said, no.
[00:57:25.762 --> 00:57:27.003]  And so they got a hold of us.
[00:57:27.003 --> 00:57:29.705]  We had to dig it out, fax it to them, and they still barely let them go.
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:39.562]  Then, they were going through another airport, and they said, they had big signs up saying, here are the body scanners for your safety.
[00:57:39.562 --> 00:57:45.063]  They were putting them in the naked body scanners that record a 360 view of your naked body, genitalia, everything.
[00:57:45.063 --> 00:57:46.904]  And Rob Dew and Aaron said no.
[00:57:46.904 --> 00:57:49.064]  And they said no politely to their gods.
[00:57:49.064 --> 00:57:53.905]  And one of the gods, one of the new leaders of the planet, grabbed Aaron by the arm.
[00:57:53.905 --> 00:57:56.126]  A big guy's grabbing him, saying, you will go in there.
[00:57:56.946 --> 00:57:58.728]  And Aaron said, no!
[00:57:58.728 --> 00:58:00.771]  You're not going to show my naked body.
[00:58:00.771 --> 00:58:02.413]  And the guy said, oh, that's not what it does.
[00:58:02.413 --> 00:58:03.494]  Boom!
[00:58:03.494 --> 00:58:04.115]  They brag.
[00:58:04.115 --> 00:58:06.638]  It's a biometric scan of your whole body.
[00:58:06.638 --> 00:58:09.282]  It's a clearer image than the naked eye.
[00:58:09.282 --> 00:58:12.806]  When I look at someone naked, I don't see their pores.
[00:58:12.806 --> 00:58:14.248]  This makes every pore stand out.
[00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:22.293]  And a lot of people are saying, it's like when you go to Disney World and they want you to face scan and thumb print to get in, say no.
[00:58:22.293 --> 00:58:26.517]  Or when the grocery store wants you to thumb print to buy food.
[00:58:26.517 --> 00:58:29.840]  You gotta say no to this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:37.347]  And in America, they think they're supposed to put their filthy hands on you when you say, look, you're not putting me in your Nazi machine.
[00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:42.851]  Back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:42.851 --> 00:58:44.032]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.322 --> 00:58:50.304]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.304 --> 00:58:54.846]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.846 --> 00:58:55.767]  Number one.
[00:58:55.767 --> 00:58:59.188]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.188 --> 00:59:00.049]  Number two.
[00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:04.931]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.931 --> 00:59:05.691]  It's true.
[00:59:05.691 --> 00:59:10.554]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.554 --> 00:59:11.074]  Number three.
[00:59:11.354 --> 00:59:14.959]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.959 --> 00:59:19.665]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.665 --> 00:59:22.429]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.429 --> 00:59:25.774]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.895 --> 00:59:31.039]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.039 --> 00:59:36.103]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.103 --> 00:59:40.267]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.267 --> 00:59:42.068]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.068 --> 00:59:46.652]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:53.283 --> 00:59:55.665]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.665 --> 01:00:05.093]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.093 --> 01:00:06.394]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:08.176]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.176 --> 01:00:09.937]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.937 --> 01:00:11.519]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.519 --> 01:00:12.440]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:17.264]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.264 --> 01:00:19.606]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.479 --> 01:00:32.589]  Alex Jones!
[01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:35.072]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:00:36.713 --> 01:00:38.354]  Already into hour number two.
[01:00:38.354 --> 01:00:39.715]  Wide open phones.
[01:00:39.715 --> 01:00:41.017]  Big news blitz coming up.
[01:00:41.017 --> 01:00:44.259]  The so-called death panel measure survives in the House bill.
[01:00:44.259 --> 01:00:46.081]  The public option.
[01:00:46.081 --> 01:00:47.141]  1900 page nightmare.
[01:00:47.141 --> 01:00:49.664]  We'll get into the latest economic news as well.
[01:00:49.664 --> 01:00:53.286]  And in England, you're going to have to have a license to be with your children in public.
[01:00:53.286 --> 01:00:54.547]  That's in the London Telegraph.
[01:00:54.547 --> 01:00:55.989]  The end of the family.
[01:00:55.989 --> 01:00:57.730]  This is what the social services are planning.
[01:00:57.730 --> 01:00:58.831]  That's coming up as well.
[01:00:58.831 --> 01:01:01.693]  Big news blitz in T-minus 30 minutes.
[01:01:01.693 --> 01:01:03.855]  Let's talk to Daniel in New York.
[01:01:03.855 --> 01:01:04.856]  Daniel, you're on the air.
[01:01:05.799 --> 01:01:07.340]  Yes, good morning Alex.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:11.944]  I just want to say I appreciate your show, and I definitely believe that God speaks through you.
[01:01:11.944 --> 01:01:15.266]  I was listening one day, and I was praying.
[01:01:15.266 --> 01:01:22.532]  You forgot to answer me, and you just started talking, and it was as though God was speaking right through you to me.
[01:01:22.532 --> 01:01:24.954]  I just want to say thanks for that.
[01:01:24.954 --> 01:01:30.298]  But again, I want to... I think God, sir, I think God speaks through all of us.
[01:01:30.298 --> 01:01:31.118]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:01:31.118 --> 01:01:31.819]  I agree.
[01:01:33.274 --> 01:01:37.998]  But he definitely used you that day to reach out to me, so I just want to say thanks for that.
[01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:38.898]  What were you asking?
[01:01:38.898 --> 01:01:41.561]  God, if God was real, give you a sign?
[01:01:41.561 --> 01:01:42.281]  No, no.
[01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:46.925]  Just some personal things that I was going through in my life.
[01:01:46.925 --> 01:01:53.850]  And, you know, it was as though when I listened to your show that day, my prayer was answered.
[01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:53.930]  Wow.
[01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:55.231]  Well, that's a real blessing.
[01:01:55.231 --> 01:01:56.432]  Thank you.
[01:01:56.432 --> 01:01:58.134]  You're welcome.
[01:01:58.134 --> 01:01:59.735]  The reason I'm calling is
[01:02:00.288 --> 01:02:03.850]  Western New York, we're organizing up here pretty well.
[01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:24.103]  We have Campaign for Liberty, we have the Oath Keepers, we also have We Are Change, and what we're doing is once a month we put together a festival, and this November we're going to be doing a festival at the German House Auditorium on Poisoned Foods, and we're going to be covering the Kodak Elementarius.
[01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:35.219]  That is a great way to reach mainline conservatives and liberals, because everybody knows the GMO is bad, all the studies are out, they know the mercury is bad in the shots, they know the fluoride is bad.
[01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:45.687]  National polls, over 80% want the fluoride out, but the government knows best, and so that's a great way to bring people into the wider awakening.
[01:02:45.687 --> 01:02:53.654]  Yeah, and I want to call on all Infowarriors to come to this on November 19th, and we need to strengthen this part of the country.
[01:02:54.213 --> 01:02:56.215]  And it's amazing.
[01:02:56.215 --> 01:03:00.480]  Every time I call your show and I make a calling, how many people show up?
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.502]  And I just want to, again, thank you for that.
[01:03:02.502 --> 01:03:08.287]  We're going to be having your newest movie there available for the general public.
[01:03:08.287 --> 01:03:11.351]  So that's another way we get those info bombs out there.
[01:03:11.351 --> 01:03:13.813]  Well done.
[01:03:13.813 --> 01:03:15.975]  Thank you so much for the... Oops, go ahead.
[01:03:15.975 --> 01:03:17.337]  About the website?
[01:03:17.337 --> 01:03:17.517]  Sure.
[01:03:18.507 --> 01:03:28.669]  It's Campaign for Liberty New York or Campaign for Liberty NY and it has all our links and it has all the groups that are going to be sponsoring this event.
[01:03:28.669 --> 01:03:30.489]  Excellent, good to hear from you.
[01:03:30.489 --> 01:03:33.970]  Sam in Arizona, go ahead.
[01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:34.990]  Hey Alex.
[01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:36.151]  Hey buddy.
[01:03:36.151 --> 01:03:42.452]  Hey, thanks for taking my call and I just want to say it does, it starts where we stand.
[01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:48.133]  Also, I wanted to report today to you that Phoenix is completely covered with chemtrails.
[01:03:49.096 --> 01:03:53.459]  Uh, just in time for all the millions of kids to trick-or-treat tomorrow.
[01:03:53.459 --> 01:04:05.786]  But, uh, I was wondering if it was going on in any other cities across the country, because... Well, yes, the, uh, the White House science czar admits there's a giant secret program to weather, um, modify the planet.
[01:04:05.786 --> 01:04:07.507]  They call it geoengineering.
[01:04:07.507 --> 01:04:11.529]  If this was a foreign planet like Mars, it would be called terraforming.
[01:04:11.529 --> 01:04:14.191]  And the science shows they're trying to heat the Earth up
[01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:21.832]  One reason is they know we're due for another ice age, and that's exactly how the globalists would operate.
[01:04:21.832 --> 01:04:33.256]  They know the Earth's cooling down, entering the cycle, so they're trying to heat it, while telling everyone they need a tax on carbon dioxide, which is a joke, because humans don't even affect that.
[01:04:33.256 --> 01:04:34.557]  The UN's own study shows it.
[01:04:35.563 --> 01:04:51.742]  And so they want to tax that, but then the chemtrail weather modification system they use is also barium salts, aluminum dioxide that's toxic to all life, plant and animal, insect, you name it, bacterial, you name it.
[01:04:52.523 --> 01:04:52.883]  Stay there.
[01:04:52.883 --> 01:04:56.985]  We're going to come back and talk more about chemtrails with you, Sam, and James, Josh, John, and others.
[01:04:56.985 --> 01:04:58.566]  News blitz as well, straight ahead.
[01:04:58.566 --> 01:05:00.406]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:00.406 --> 01:05:08.149]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[01:05:08.149 --> 01:05:14.232]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[01:05:14.232 --> 01:05:16.893]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:05:17.173 --> 01:05:23.458]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:05:23.458 --> 01:05:27.542]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:05:27.542 --> 01:05:32.906]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:05:33.146 --> 01:05:35.226]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:05:35.226 --> 01:05:36.987]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:05:36.987 --> 01:05:39.507]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:05:39.507 --> 01:05:44.228]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:05:44.228 --> 01:05:47.929]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:05:47.929 --> 01:05:51.070]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:52.950]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:55.071]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:01.289 --> 01:06:05.312]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.312 --> 01:06:08.555]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.555 --> 01:06:13.359]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.359 --> 01:06:19.744]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:19.744 --> 01:06:21.986]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.506 --> 01:06:24.127]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:06:24.127 --> 01:06:25.288]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.288 --> 01:06:27.530]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.262]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:06:43.262 --> 01:06:48.708]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:48.708 --> 01:06:57.819]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:59.801 --> 01:07:08.968]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:07:08.968 --> 01:07:12.330]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:18.195]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:07:18.195 --> 01:07:22.978]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:07:22.978 --> 01:07:25.320]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:34.787]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:07:34.787 --> 01:07:40.332]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[01:07:40.332 --> 01:07:42.173]  Help others and earn extra income!
[01:07:42.253 --> 01:07:44.675]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.741 --> 01:08:11.562]  Here's the headline.
[01:08:11.562 --> 01:08:17.003]  Council bans parents from play areas.
[01:08:17.003 --> 01:08:34.389]  Got another headline here, out of England, where they've announced that 20,000 plus families, when their baby's born, the CPS, the Child Kidnapping Services, Child Pedophile Services, predominantly there's more pedophiles in those groups, statistically.
[01:08:35.441 --> 01:08:38.485]  The FBI even admits to any other group, where do you think pedophiles go to get jobs?
[01:08:38.485 --> 01:08:41.388]  I'm not saying they're all pedophiles, but they have the highest percentage.
[01:08:41.388 --> 01:08:43.691]  Truancy officers, CPS workers.
[01:08:43.691 --> 01:08:51.000]  And they're trying to push the same thing here, where when your baby's born, they put a camera in your house for a year.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.563]  Cameras in every room that the government monitors.
[01:08:54.714 --> 01:09:03.500]  And one of the fastest growing areas in England of government jobs is people to monitor the cameras from their home via the internet.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:09.984]  So your neighbors are watching you with your children, making sure they get fed, making sure they go to bed, making sure you don't discipline them.
[01:09:11.601 --> 01:09:15.142]  This is how the government plans to break up families and take over our life.
[01:09:15.142 --> 01:09:17.403]  That's why Obama wants a year-round school.
[01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:22.866]  That's in all the big Department of Education and United Nations UNESCO documents.
[01:09:22.866 --> 01:09:37.532]  I've had the former head of policy, Charlotte Isserby, but let's get her back on, who was in the Department of Education, the number two person for four years in the Department of Education, Charlotte Isserby, and that was the plan back then, and she was in there in the 1980s.
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:45.521]  So we're going to be breaking that down also.
[01:09:45.521 --> 01:09:48.782]  The 1900 page government takeover of health care.
[01:09:48.782 --> 01:09:49.862]  Worse than we thought.
[01:09:49.862 --> 01:09:51.283]  Death panels.
[01:09:51.283 --> 01:09:52.243]  Public option.
[01:09:52.243 --> 01:09:53.424]  Takeover of health care.
[01:09:53.424 --> 01:09:54.664]  It's all there.
[01:09:54.664 --> 01:09:56.325]  That's just some of the news we're going to be covering.
[01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:58.186]  But we're continuing to take your calls.
[01:09:58.186 --> 01:09:59.006]  Sam in Arizona.
[01:09:59.006 --> 01:10:00.987]  I just went to him at the break, so I'm going back to him.
[01:10:01.747 --> 01:10:02.808]  He brought up chemtrails.
[01:10:02.808 --> 01:10:05.149]  That's what we've called them since the mid-1990s.
[01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:10.753]  They're called aerosol spray, and there's a giant government weather modification program.
[01:10:10.753 --> 01:10:19.979]  Private meteorologists and toxicologists all over the country we've interviewed would get samples of the chemtrails over the years and said it was barium salts aluminum dioxide.
[01:10:19.979 --> 01:10:26.984]  Then nine months ago, in a press conference, John P. Holdren, the White House science czar, gave a speech.
[01:10:26.984 --> 01:10:30.647]  His number one priority was geoengineering or terraforming the planet.
[01:10:31.147 --> 01:10:33.528]  To quote, save us from global warming.
[01:10:33.528 --> 01:10:46.096]  But scientists, climatologists, looked at the chemtrailing data they put out and said, and they only declassified a little bit of the program, they said, this is heating the earth, what you're doing.
[01:10:46.096 --> 01:10:48.998]  Spraying these particles into the atmosphere.
[01:10:50.754 --> 01:11:04.446]  So there's a giant weather modification program going on, and the White House just calmly admits it, and it turns out there was a Nobel Prize given in 1992 to a climatologist who developed the plan to spray barium salts and aluminum dioxide.
[01:11:04.446 --> 01:11:08.770]  So, exactly what we said in the last decade it was, is what it turns out to be.
[01:11:10.111 --> 01:11:16.179]  But they call all the massive chemtrailing, that's condensation clouds that don't go away.
[01:11:16.179 --> 01:11:19.124]  They just dissipate and become cloud banks.
[01:11:19.124 --> 01:11:24.191]  A normal ice crystal trail disappears in seconds or at the max minutes.
[01:11:24.191 --> 01:11:27.115]  These new trails in the last 15 years don't dissipate.
[01:11:28.902 --> 01:11:30.523]  They expand.
[01:11:30.523 --> 01:11:31.985]  It's weather modification.
[01:11:31.985 --> 01:11:36.148]  There's a giant, secret weather modification program going on.
[01:11:36.148 --> 01:11:37.830]  They claim it's for global warming.
[01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:54.464]  I remember three years ago, suddenly government-sponsored textbooks nationwide, multiple textbooks for 7th and 8th graders said, oh, the government's spraying sunscreen with these trails to protect the Earth from global warming and dangerous UV radiation to help the ozone layer.
[01:11:57.386 --> 01:12:02.609]  And then we go, why is this in a textbook while the media calls us kooks and says we're conspiracy terrorists?
[01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:24.160]  That's like if I read Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary General, in an editorial Sunday called We Can Do It, published in hundreds of newspapers globally, including the New York Times, said we want global government and the carbon tax system and the Copenhagen-Denmark Treaty of December will fund the world government
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:29.744]  I mean, he says world government, global governance, we're going to tax you.
[01:12:29.744 --> 01:12:30.785]  We see the treaty.
[01:12:30.785 --> 01:12:37.911]  It's taxes on beef, on fish, on rubber, on oil, on gas, on your homes, taxes on dogs.
[01:12:37.911 --> 01:12:39.453]  That was in the LA Times Tuesday.
[01:12:40.814 --> 01:12:47.919]  And the article said, okay, I believe in global warming, and it's man-made, and that you should tax us, but keep your hands off my damn dog, was a quote.
[01:12:47.919 --> 01:13:02.029]  So even the people quote against it in mainstream media say, well, that's going a little far, taxing my dog, because an average 40-pound dog, the UN says, has as big a carbon footprint as a 4X4 SUV in a year.
[01:13:04.178 --> 01:13:06.059]  I mean, do you get the idea what this means?
[01:13:06.059 --> 01:13:07.100]  This is massive.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.882]  So, they're admitting world government.
[01:13:09.882 --> 01:13:15.925]  If you Google the term global governance, or new world order, in fact, let's do it right now for me.
[01:13:15.925 --> 01:13:30.654]  You type it in, you click it, and there are thousands of articles a week, new ones, under news, not web, you click news, saying how great global government is, how wonderful world government is, how fabulous it is, how it is a socialist world government.
[01:13:30.654 --> 01:13:33.036]  I saw a letter written to the European Union,
[01:13:35.834 --> 01:13:38.715]  That was presented at a Goldman Sachs meeting.
[01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:41.635]  It's the Financial Times of London today.
[01:13:41.635 --> 01:13:48.757]  And they're interviewing some British lord calling for world government in the video piece that they have with the article.
[01:13:48.757 --> 01:14:00.179]  And he says in there, and they have part of the letter from Gordon Brown, the British Prime Minister, saying, oh, you must appoint Tony Blair as the head of the EU.
[01:14:00.179 --> 01:14:02.840]  Oh, he's so wonderful because he's a fellow socialist.
[01:14:03.985 --> 01:14:08.367]  But then you say, hey, I don't want a socialist government.
[01:14:08.367 --> 01:14:10.668]  They say, oh my gosh, you're racist!
[01:14:10.668 --> 01:14:13.609]  I mean, see the basic mind control they use?
[01:14:13.609 --> 01:14:14.970]  They're the ones injecting race.
[01:14:14.970 --> 01:14:17.310]  It's nothing to do with race.
[01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:19.191]  It's like saying, hey, I don't want to turn my guns in.
[01:14:19.191 --> 01:14:20.692]  Oh, you hate black people.
[01:14:20.692 --> 01:14:22.032]  Excuse me?
[01:14:22.032 --> 01:14:22.793]  Oh, you're a racist.
[01:14:22.793 --> 01:14:25.474]  Well, no, it's like a Monty Python skit or something.
[01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:31.627]  It'd be like if you were at the grocery store and said, excuse me, can you tell me where the bottled water is?
[01:14:31.627 --> 01:14:35.410]  And they said, oh, you want to kill Jews.
[01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:37.212]  In fact, the media does that a lot.
[01:14:37.212 --> 01:14:42.757]  They'll attack me every day in mainstream news articles and say Alex Jones doesn't like Obama.
[01:14:44.039 --> 01:14:48.100]  He's like white supremacists who believe in the learned elders of Zion.
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.380]  We're not talking about the learned elders of Zion.
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.121]  We're not talking about Jews.
[01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:53.661]  They talk about Jews.
[01:14:53.661 --> 01:14:57.542]  They say, oh, Ron Paul wants to abolish the Fed or audit it.
[01:14:57.542 --> 01:14:59.283]  That's what white supremacists want.
[01:14:59.283 --> 01:15:01.163]  They just inject this.
[01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:04.644]  Oh, you don't like socialism.
[01:15:04.644 --> 01:15:05.984]  Oh, well, you must be a racist.
[01:15:05.984 --> 01:15:07.584]  It has nothing to do with anything.
[01:15:07.584 --> 01:15:09.485]  All right, I said I'm going to get to the news later.
[01:15:13.331 --> 01:15:14.332]  It's mind-blowing.
[01:15:14.332 --> 01:15:16.533]  And they cold-bloodedly know you're not a racist.
[01:15:16.533 --> 01:15:19.414]  They're just engaging in divide-and-conquer.
[01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:20.515]  So that's all coming up.
[01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:22.296]  Oh, you don't like socialist healthcare?
[01:15:22.296 --> 01:15:24.597]  You're a racist.
[01:15:24.597 --> 01:15:29.520]  Oh, you don't want the federal government to start inspecting all garage sales and
[01:15:30.327 --> 01:15:45.411]  Bazaars and gun shows, and if anybody's selling anything that was ever recalled of hundreds of thousands of products, $100,000 fine, two years in prison first time, $15 million fine, and a two-year prison sentence the second time?
[01:15:45.411 --> 01:15:47.071]  What does that have to do with racism?
[01:15:47.071 --> 01:15:47.852]  Racist!
[01:15:47.852 --> 01:15:50.552]  Racist!
[01:15:50.552 --> 01:15:54.373]  Hey, that's a violation of the Tenth Amendment to have the feds inspecting my garage sale.
[01:15:54.373 --> 01:15:56.434]  Oh, did you learn that at the Klan meeting?
[01:15:57.892 --> 01:16:00.134]  You're like, what does it have to do with this?
[01:16:00.134 --> 01:16:02.236]  They're the ones creating the division.
[01:16:02.236 --> 01:16:04.698]  The elite want us all at each other's throats.
[01:16:04.698 --> 01:16:07.240]  Everybody fighting with each other.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:14.546]  All the different groups and parties and economic strata, religious groups.
[01:16:14.546 --> 01:16:15.667]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:17.049]  Finish up on chemtrails, Sam.
[01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:21.394]  Yeah, Alex, thanks again for taking my call.
[01:16:21.394 --> 01:16:24.357]  But again, it's just, I see him spraying every day.
[01:16:24.357 --> 01:16:27.061]  Today is the worst I've seen it in years.
[01:16:27.061 --> 01:16:30.545]  And I go outside, my eyes burn, it's ridiculous.
[01:16:30.545 --> 01:16:32.828]  One other thing I'd like to say is Ron Paul for President 2012.
[01:16:33.908 --> 01:16:35.109]  All right, buddy.
[01:16:35.109 --> 01:16:43.113]  But finishing my point, because I tend to drift around going on different rabbit trails, is the media says world government doesn't exist.
[01:16:43.113 --> 01:16:45.434]  Go back to the Google main page for me, please.
[01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:55.199]  They say it doesn't exist when every week there are thousands of articles with the term world government, new world order in it.
[01:16:55.199 --> 01:16:56.760]  The first block of stories has 744.
[01:17:00.134 --> 01:17:03.977]  We clicked it Monday and it was 1,200 plus.
[01:17:03.977 --> 01:17:22.552]  But that's just in the last seven days, 744 stories from the New York Times, the Times of London, the Associated Press, Raw Story, the New American, the Press of India, Chinese government news.
[01:17:22.552 --> 01:17:26.915]  I see a Prison Planet article, up yours Ban Ki-moon.
[01:17:26.915 --> 01:17:28.136]  I didn't write that headline.
[01:17:29.762 --> 01:17:31.302]  Oh, boy.
[01:17:31.302 --> 01:17:34.023]  Let's talk to James in New York.
[01:17:34.023 --> 01:17:35.043]  James, you're on the air.
[01:17:35.043 --> 01:17:36.404]  Go ahead.
[01:17:36.404 --> 01:17:36.844]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:36.844 --> 01:17:38.184]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:17:38.184 --> 01:17:40.104]  Welcome.
[01:17:40.104 --> 01:17:40.564]  Okay.
[01:17:40.564 --> 01:17:53.647]  I've got your broadcast on the podcast, but getting straight to the point, I woke up Monday morning, and normally I turn on PBS Kids, and then I'm watching this program called Sid the Science Kid.
[01:17:53.647 --> 01:17:57.368]  Normally fairly good, but that morning I turned it on, and suddenly
[01:17:57.938 --> 01:18:00.739]  It's a straight push for the swine flu vaccination.
[01:18:00.739 --> 01:18:05.382]  I mean, a straight, out-of-the-gate push for that.
[01:18:05.382 --> 01:18:06.682]  110% propaganda.
[01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:07.282]  Yeah.
[01:18:07.282 --> 01:18:13.625]  Bush spent $8 billion in covert funding for fake newscasts and paid-off reporters.
[01:18:13.625 --> 01:18:14.946]  Totally illegal.
[01:18:14.946 --> 01:18:18.728]  The General Accounting Office put on record that was $8 billion in one program.
[01:18:20.089 --> 01:18:22.129]  Hundreds of billions were spent in his eight years.
[01:18:22.129 --> 01:18:35.952]  Obama radically expanded that, and the news reports we saw two weeks ago were every major children's television show, and this has been done six months ago, they did this six months ago, was funded.
[01:18:35.952 --> 01:18:44.734]  Every major television show, Nickelodeon, PBS, every show that was in production was paid, in some cases, millions.
[01:18:44.734 --> 01:18:46.214]  You know, we all hear about Donald Trump.
[01:18:46.995 --> 01:18:51.855]  Getting $3 million per episode of The Apprentice and a contract from Virgin Airlines.
[01:18:53.035 --> 01:18:54.816]  Okay, well that's product placement.
[01:18:54.816 --> 01:18:57.719]  This is propaganda placement, the term I coined.
[01:18:57.719 --> 01:19:04.904]  It's all straight up Soviet Union, Nazi Germany level, state sponsored propaganda.
[01:19:04.904 --> 01:19:09.348]  So you saw this particular piece, what was it?
[01:19:09.348 --> 01:19:18.235]  We saw one PBS show where it was cartoons, and it's like, in fact, pull that up, Watson did a story, I forget the headline, you can call Watson if we can't find it.
[01:19:18.935 --> 01:19:20.196]  I love the shots.
[01:19:20.196 --> 01:19:21.156]  It's so good.
[01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:23.518]  I'm gonna get it.
[01:19:23.518 --> 01:19:24.318]  With a little jingle.
[01:19:24.318 --> 01:19:24.678]  I'm sorry.
[01:19:24.678 --> 01:19:25.579]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:19:25.579 --> 01:19:30.862]  Yeah, but I mean, I just like they got the thing.
[01:19:30.862 --> 01:19:32.663]  They've got this coming on.
[01:19:32.663 --> 01:19:36.265]  And my wife saw it a couple of days ago and she's totally disgusted.
[01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:51.525]  Also, I've been bringing that up to various people where we're staying, and this one woman actually gave her kid the first shot, the main flu shot, but I showed her some stuff that I pulled off the web for Swine Flu, and she was just like, I am not letting my kid do that.
[01:19:51.525 --> 01:19:53.747]  Anything else you'd like to add, James?
[01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:56.069]  Stay there!
[01:19:56.069 --> 01:20:00.233]  We're gonna go to break, come back, and I'm gonna find that cartoon where they're like, I love the shot!
[01:20:02.577 --> 01:20:04.579]  Remain in your houses.
[01:20:04.579 --> 01:20:10.344]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[01:20:10.344 --> 01:20:11.705]  Will they do it?
[01:20:11.705 --> 01:20:14.328]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[01:20:14.328 --> 01:20:20.794]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[01:20:20.794 --> 01:20:22.035]  Think it can't happen here?
[01:20:22.975 --> 01:20:27.258]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[01:20:27.258 --> 01:20:32.120]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:37.043]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[01:20:37.043 --> 01:20:41.866]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[01:20:42.786 --> 01:20:51.191]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:20:51.191 --> 01:20:53.693]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:20:53.693 --> 01:20:56.775]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[01:20:56.775 --> 01:20:59.677]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[01:21:01.488 --> 01:21:02.508]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:21:02.508 --> 01:21:08.030]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.591]  I get it.
[01:21:08.591 --> 01:21:17.914]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:21:18.194 --> 01:21:19.615]  That's not what's happening.
[01:21:19.615 --> 01:21:28.077]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:21:28.077 --> 01:21:31.479]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:21:31.479 --> 01:21:35.520]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.321]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:21:37.321 --> 01:21:41.284]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[01:21:41.284 --> 01:21:45.107]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:21:45.107 --> 01:21:46.007]  You should too.
[01:21:46.007 --> 01:21:47.168]  Find out what they know.
[01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:50.090]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:50.150]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.150 --> 01:21:50.210]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:50.571]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.888 --> 01:22:04.071]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Hunter safes.
[01:22:04.071 --> 01:22:07.855]  The makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:22:07.855 --> 01:22:10.698]  Graf Hunter safes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:22:10.698 --> 01:22:14.081]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle.
[01:22:14.081 --> 01:22:15.343]  Quality above all else.
[01:22:15.343 --> 01:22:19.867]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[01:22:19.867 --> 01:22:21.729]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[01:22:21.849 --> 01:22:22.349]  We're good to go!
[01:22:42.486 --> 01:22:42.806]  We're good.
[01:23:01.056 --> 01:23:07.441]  If you believe Obama is creating runaway inflation, I'll tell you how to profit from this insanity with a free kit.
[01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:08.682]  First, the facts.
[01:23:08.682 --> 01:23:11.344]  Obama is spending like a drunken sailor.
[01:23:11.344 --> 01:23:16.928]  $700 billion for TARP, $122 billion for AIG, more for Fannie and Freddie.
[01:23:16.928 --> 01:23:17.768]  The result?
[01:23:17.768 --> 01:23:23.552]  A deficit of over $1.8 trillion and the probability of interest rates going above 18% and inflation above 20%.
[01:23:26.114 --> 01:23:27.596]  Now the good news.
[01:23:27.596 --> 01:23:36.905]  Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential and Investment Newsletter, created a free inflation survival kit.
[01:23:36.905 --> 01:23:42.812]  The kit outlines how these circumstances created opportunities to turn $10,000 into as much as $431,000 in 12 to 18 months.
[01:23:47.336 --> 01:23:50.837]  If you're thinking about gold, get this free kit now by calling 888-314-8782.
[01:23:50.837 --> 01:23:51.057]  That's 888-314-8782.
[01:23:51.057 --> 01:23:53.177]  Or go to the website inflationsurvivalkit.com.
[01:23:53.177 --> 01:23:54.178]  You look like an angel.
[01:23:54.178 --> 01:23:54.698]  Walk like an angel.
[01:23:54.698 --> 01:23:55.218]  Talk like an angel.
[01:24:21.731 --> 01:24:25.273]  But the flu shot isn't even the devil in disguise.
[01:24:25.273 --> 01:24:29.415]  It's killing all these people, maiming people, paralyzing folks.
[01:24:29.415 --> 01:24:33.198]  The Gardasil shot is killing women all over the country and the world.
[01:24:35.569 --> 01:24:44.596]  Every few months I see mainstream articles about the polio vaccine worldwide being super weaponized, live, killing people, CBS News, Associated Press.
[01:24:44.596 --> 01:24:47.999]  But then they say, oh, it's a conspiracy theory the vaccine can hurt you.
[01:24:47.999 --> 01:24:50.341]  It's a conspiracy theory there's world government.
[01:24:50.341 --> 01:24:52.963]  We're just announcing it in thousands of newspapers every week.
[01:24:55.851 --> 01:25:06.987]  Here's a television program, an example of many that are government-funded, paid to brainwash your children and to tell them how great it is to get the swine flu shot.
[01:25:06.987 --> 01:25:07.327]  Here it is.
[01:25:09.338 --> 01:25:12.002]  Hey kids, we're ready to roll.
[01:25:12.002 --> 01:25:14.525]  Stopping that virus, that's our goal.
[01:25:14.525 --> 01:25:17.249]  So come on everybody, we're getting the shot.
[01:25:17.249 --> 01:25:18.731]  It might hurt a little bit.
[01:25:18.731 --> 01:25:19.813]  Just a little bit.
[01:25:19.813 --> 01:25:23.377]  But it's gonna help a whole lot.
[01:25:23.377 --> 01:25:25.861]  This vaccination is a great opportunity.
[01:25:37.088 --> 01:25:42.734]  So roll up your sleeves and come and get it!
[01:25:42.734 --> 01:25:45.177]  If I don't get the virus, I won't give it to you!
[01:25:45.177 --> 01:25:47.859]  If you don't give it to me, I won't give it to her!
[01:25:47.859 --> 01:25:50.863]  If I don't get it from her, I won't give it to them!
[01:25:50.863 --> 01:25:52.544]  That's true!
[01:25:52.544 --> 01:25:55.307]  If I don't get the virus, I won't give it to you!
[01:25:55.307 --> 01:25:57.710]  Hey kids, we're ready to roll!
[01:26:02.303 --> 01:26:20.178]  I'm surprised Hitler didn't have newsreels like this for people going into the death camps.
[01:26:22.386 --> 01:26:24.308]  And did you hear her go, ha ha ha?
[01:26:24.308 --> 01:26:26.490]  And then she gives the child the injection.
[01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:29.392]  He goes, yay, my IQ just got reduced.
[01:26:29.392 --> 01:26:32.375]  I'll get cancer and be brain damaged.
[01:26:32.375 --> 01:26:34.897]  Yay, so much fun.
[01:26:34.897 --> 01:26:40.021]  But you notice the witch nurse goes, it may hurt some, but it'll help a lot.
[01:26:41.755 --> 01:26:45.777]  They can't even help, just add a little... We just love it!
[01:26:45.777 --> 01:26:52.240]  We're the New World Order, we write hundreds of giant textbooks how we're putting stuff in the vaccines that sterilize you.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:55.581]  You're gonna have all sorts of health problems and autoimmune diseases.
[01:26:55.581 --> 01:26:56.582]  Oh, it's so good!
[01:26:56.582 --> 01:27:00.964]  Cue it back up to the... Here it is.
[01:27:17.179 --> 01:27:19.621]  If I don't get the virus, I won't give it to you.
[01:27:19.621 --> 01:27:22.283]  If you don't give it to me, I won't give it to her.
[01:27:22.283 --> 01:27:25.325]  If I don't get it from her, I won't give it to them.
[01:27:46.477 --> 01:27:56.485]  I can't watch much more of this, but if you go back to earlier, she goes, it's really sick.
[01:27:56.485 --> 01:28:01.469]  The headline on this article is government hijacks kids TV to propagandize for swine flu shots.
[01:28:02.864 --> 01:28:10.907]  Desperate brainwashing campaign to coerce suspicious parents into giving their children dangerous H1N1 vaccine accelerates.
[01:28:10.907 --> 01:28:16.188]  The federal government has accelerated its 16 million dollar PR campaign.
[01:28:16.188 --> 01:28:17.369]  It's a lot more than that.
[01:28:17.369 --> 01:28:28.913]  To brainwash and coerce increasingly suspicious Americans into taking the swine flu vaccine by weaving their propaganda to popular preschool show.
[01:28:28.913 --> 01:28:29.493]  The children
[01:28:31.325 --> 01:28:34.406]  For currently showing on PBS Kids.
[01:28:34.406 --> 01:28:35.866]  Sid the Science Kid.
[01:28:35.866 --> 01:28:37.927]  And that's what the caller just called about.
[01:28:37.927 --> 01:28:41.687]  Let me go back to James in New York.
[01:28:41.687 --> 01:28:45.128]  James, was this the episode you saw or another one?
[01:28:45.128 --> 01:28:48.849]  That is the exact episode that I saw.
[01:28:48.849 --> 01:28:57.271]  That is the precise episode that I saw and it is just... I was looking at this and I told both my kids, don't let them give you any sort of a shot.
[01:28:57.271 --> 01:29:00.432]  They actually passed out a package for the public schools.
[01:29:01.184 --> 01:29:04.468]  If you fill it out, that means that you're accepting the shot.
[01:29:04.468 --> 01:29:06.751]  If you don't, that means that you're not allowing it.
[01:29:06.751 --> 01:29:07.511]  That's a waiver form.
[01:29:07.511 --> 01:29:09.253]  You're waiving liability.
[01:29:09.253 --> 01:29:17.683]  So if you get paralyzed or get brain damaged or have a convulsion or have a heart attack from the autoimmune response in the ventricles of your heart, you won't come after them.
[01:29:17.683 --> 01:29:19.765]  I mean, the German government won't take it.
[01:29:19.765 --> 01:29:21.507]  The military won't take it over there.
[01:29:22.679 --> 01:29:24.680]  People are dying all over the world.
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:39.647]  The FDA admits it's paralyzing people and giving them convulsions here in the U.S., but then they hand out lying sheets to the children telling them that this is all conspiracy theories.
[01:29:39.647 --> 01:29:40.368]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.328 --> 01:29:55.258]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.258 --> 01:29:57.946]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.209 --> 01:30:04.210]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.210 --> 01:30:09.533]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.533 --> 01:30:11.593]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.593 --> 01:30:16.596]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.596 --> 01:30:17.776]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.776 --> 01:30:18.897]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.897 --> 01:30:20.777]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.777 --> 01:30:21.858]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.858 --> 01:30:24.059]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.059 --> 01:30:25.399]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.399 --> 01:30:26.700]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:32.186]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.186 --> 01:30:35.771]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.771 --> 01:30:39.595]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.595 --> 01:30:40.816]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.816 --> 01:30:41.717]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.717 --> 01:30:42.839]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.839 --> 01:30:43.580]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:44.581]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.841 --> 01:30:47.882]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.882 --> 01:30:49.663]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.663 --> 01:30:50.583]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.182 --> 01:31:04.284]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:31:04.284 --> 01:31:07.165]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:31:07.165 --> 01:31:08.445]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:31:08.445 --> 01:31:09.266]  It's very real.
[01:31:09.266 --> 01:31:11.507]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:31:11.507 --> 01:31:13.167]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:32:00.006 --> 01:32:05.311]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:05.311 --> 01:32:09.835]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:09.835 --> 01:32:12.117]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:12.117 --> 01:32:13.739]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:32:13.739 --> 01:32:14.780]  There is a solution.

[01:33:20.726 --> 01:33:29.812]  What would the Founding Fathers think if they could be teleported to the future today?
[01:33:29.812 --> 01:33:43.901]  Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Patrick Henry, John Paul Jones, Benjamin Franklin,
[01:33:45.885 --> 01:33:50.288]  What would they think today if they could see the state of our society?
[01:33:50.288 --> 01:33:52.289]  We don't have to go back that far.
[01:33:52.289 --> 01:33:53.690]  Look at Soviet Russia.
[01:33:53.690 --> 01:33:54.611]  Look at East Germany.
[01:33:54.611 --> 01:33:55.991]  Look at Nazi Germany.
[01:33:55.991 --> 01:33:58.633]  Communist China.
[01:33:58.633 --> 01:34:01.055]  Pol Pot's Cambodia.
[01:34:01.055 --> 01:34:05.457]  Look at the tyranny that is Egypt today.
[01:34:05.457 --> 01:34:10.661]  By every benchmark, by every measure, historically society
[01:34:12.128 --> 01:34:21.692]  From the angle of anthropology, we are a free society descending into classical tyranny, the likes of which the world's never seen.
[01:34:21.692 --> 01:34:36.238]  We're not just descending into tyranny, we're descending into a scientific tyranny, where they've used psychology to study human activity, how to turn us against each other, how to dumb us down, how to make us feel hopeless, powerless, how to play us off against each other.
[01:34:37.796 --> 01:34:43.240]  So when you hear somebody say, the founders are rolling in their graves, you better bet they are.
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.122]  Better believe it.
[01:34:45.122 --> 01:34:47.483]  And it's only getting more intense.
[01:34:47.483 --> 01:34:49.845]  It's only getting worse by the minute.
[01:34:49.845 --> 01:34:51.847]  I am even taken back and blown away.
[01:34:51.847 --> 01:34:58.292]  As bad as the Globalist are, as bad as I know them to be, as many other white papers and textbooks and speeches I've read,
[01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:05.233]  It's still hard to believe they're really poisoning the water and the food and the vaccines by design.
[01:35:05.233 --> 01:35:19.903]  It's hard to believe, even when you read the White House Science Czar's 1,100-page book, Ecoscience, where he calls for forced sterilization, forced abortion, infanticide, drugging the water supply and vaccines.
[01:35:19.903 --> 01:35:23.506]  When you read Bertrand Russell, Nobel Prize winner, saying the same thing in the 50s,
[01:35:26.274 --> 01:35:34.341]  When you read the first head of UNESCO at the UN, the Director General of UNESCO, Julian Huxley calling for the same things.
[01:35:34.341 --> 01:35:40.346]  When you read the 1996 Biological Diversity Assessment by the UN saying it.
[01:35:40.346 --> 01:35:42.227]  When you read the State Department memorandum 200 stating it.
[01:35:44.921 --> 01:35:48.145]  I mean, I'm giving you the names of the documents right now.
[01:35:48.145 --> 01:35:52.390]  Any one of them should have the entire elite arrested tomorrow.
[01:35:52.390 --> 01:36:02.102]  I mean, I want this to burn into police and military and people that think they serve the system and who think patriotism means trusting the government and doing whatever it says.
[01:36:02.102 --> 01:36:04.185]  The government is constituted among men.
[01:36:05.362 --> 01:36:09.705]  Under the Declaration of Independence, for freedom and due process!
[01:36:09.705 --> 01:36:22.335]  Not for a bunch of control freak, power tripping scientists to spike the water with sterilants that brain damage you and give you bone cancer!
[01:36:22.335 --> 01:36:28.299]  Our government is not constituted to kidnap people's children without due process.
[01:36:28.299 --> 01:36:34.384]  When the CPS is five times more likely, statistically, according to the Justice Department, to abuse children.
[01:36:35.612 --> 01:36:40.254]  The British statistics are seven times!
[01:36:40.254 --> 01:36:42.435]  I mean, come on, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:36:42.435 --> 01:36:46.216]  Every smart criminal on the planet goes and gets a government job.
[01:36:46.216 --> 01:36:52.818]  Only the crackhead morons go out and rob you on the street corner.
[01:36:52.818 --> 01:36:56.740]  Smart psychopaths and sociopaths get into power positions.
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:02.622]  And they've got high-tech PR firms that have studied human psychology and they know how to manipulate us.
[01:37:02.622 --> 01:37:04.763]  But once you're aware of the scam, it's all over!
[01:37:16.894 --> 01:37:23.058]  Diabetes, cancer, birth defects, it's all off the chart.
[01:37:23.058 --> 01:37:27.281]  And it's the water, and it's the vaccines, and it's the GMO food.
[01:37:27.281 --> 01:37:30.544]  I have had top scientists that were top scientists on.
[01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:33.486]  This morning, on the treadmill, I was watching The Insider.
[01:37:33.486 --> 01:37:38.750]  Hadn't seen it in over a decade since I saw it in theaters back in... Not even in college!
[01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:43.793]  Did the movie come out 15, 16, 17 years ago?
[01:37:43.793 --> 01:37:45.635]  Seems like yesterday I was in college, and now it's...
[01:37:47.257 --> 01:37:50.318]  15 years ago, 16 years ago, I'm getting old.
[01:37:50.318 --> 01:37:54.180]  You wake up one day in college and high school, some distant memory.
[01:37:54.180 --> 01:38:00.783]  But I was watching on the treadmill, watched the first half of it, jogging.
[01:38:00.783 --> 01:38:07.926]  I can't jog unless I'm watching television, but I turn on a movie or sports or something, I could sit there and watch it.
[01:38:07.926 --> 01:38:13.828]  I get too mad when I watch CNN and Fox and C-SPAN congressional hearings when I'm on the treadmill like I did yesterday.
[01:38:13.828 --> 01:38:15.109]  I just got to have a break sometime.
[01:38:16.533 --> 01:38:20.476]  But it's loosely based on, it's a composite of several true stories.
[01:38:20.476 --> 01:38:27.060]  Just like Mel Gibson's The Patriot is a composite of three people in South Carolina.
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:34.766]  One of them, the Swamp Fox.
[01:38:34.766 --> 01:38:37.348]  Called by others, the Swamp Ghost.
[01:38:37.348 --> 01:38:40.730]  But it's a composite of several true stories with the tobacco companies.
[01:38:47.165 --> 01:38:52.488]  And I was just thinking about the fact how the tobacco companies knew a hundred years ago.
[01:38:52.488 --> 01:38:55.990]  I mean, they were deeply studying cancer over a hundred years ago.
[01:38:55.990 --> 01:39:03.854]  They knew that it caused cancer and emphysema and heart problems and hardening of the arteries.
[01:39:03.854 --> 01:39:06.836]  And they just lied and put out fake science saying it didn't hurt you.
[01:39:06.836 --> 01:39:10.758]  Just like they know today that vaccines are deadly by design.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:21.184]  But I was thinking about whistleblowers.
[01:39:21.184 --> 01:39:26.529]  All the whistleblowers that came out from the tobacco companies.
[01:39:26.529 --> 01:39:31.193]  And it made me think of the whistleblowers dealing with torture.
[01:39:31.193 --> 01:39:39.260]  And how the Pentagon and the Justice Department would indict them, the whistleblowers, in Afghanistan and Iraq and in other black sites around Europe.
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:41.142]  Albanian places.
[01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:43.244]  That's where the real dungeons are, not Hardin, Montana.
[01:39:47.577 --> 01:39:51.220]  And how whistleblowers would go along with some of the torture, but then blow the whistle.
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:54.202]  Because you get the order, you carry it out, and then they blow the whistle.
[01:39:54.202 --> 01:40:05.991]  And then they would use the Patriot Act to charge them and gag them so they couldn't speak out when they go to prison.
[01:40:05.991 --> 01:40:11.334]  And they've sent scores of people to prison.
[01:40:11.334 --> 01:40:13.136]  Normally the media has it as a footnote.
[01:40:14.841 --> 01:40:34.894]  That, oh yes, this private contractor or this captain or this sergeant was given a decade in prison and charged under the Patriot Act for torture because, oh, they released the information about torture and then they get prosecuted for it, not those that gave the order.
[01:40:34.894 --> 01:40:38.157]  That's like if some mafia enforcer comes in and says,
[01:40:39.651 --> 01:40:51.699]  I was there when the orders were given for some hitmen to go kill this whole family, and then the FBI grabs them, indicts them, and puts them in prison for it, not for the people that actually gave the orders.
[01:40:51.699 --> 01:40:54.080]  It's just such a miscarriage of justice.
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:41:00.024]  So I thought about how the fake left holds up the tobacco company whistleblowers as these big heroes, when they certainly were.
[01:41:00.024 --> 01:41:05.048]  And a lot of them did get sued and got physically attacked, and a lot of bad things happened.
[01:41:05.048 --> 01:41:06.849]  But what about all the whistleblowers for torture?
[01:41:07.731 --> 01:41:10.473]  And then Obama always says one thing and does another.
[01:41:10.473 --> 01:41:18.837]  He says, I want peace with Iran, then expands the covert operations, the bombings, the shootings, the killings, the riots inside Iran.
[01:41:18.837 --> 01:41:23.940]  And he came out day one when he was sworn in in January and said, I'm going to release the torture photos.
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:26.782]  And then two days later, he said, I might release them.
[01:41:26.782 --> 01:41:36.387]  And then two days ago, when he signed the hate crime bill federalizing local police, he also signed another bill federally blocking the release of any of the torture photos or videos.
[01:41:37.881 --> 01:41:44.862]  The Army's own report says they rape children in front of their parents with large objects with battery acid on them.
[01:41:44.862 --> 01:41:46.983]  Go read the report.
[01:41:46.983 --> 01:41:50.363]  I can imagine why the media doesn't want that out.
[01:41:50.363 --> 01:41:55.444]  Our little heroes raping kids.
[01:41:55.444 --> 01:41:57.485]  And they've tried to sell you on that evil.
[01:41:57.485 --> 01:42:02.245]  Oh look, Jack Bauer tortures the guy's kid to get the answer and it stops LA from being nuked.
[01:42:02.245 --> 01:42:03.446]  Torture must be good.
[01:42:03.446 --> 01:42:05.286]  And there's all these new video games coming out.
[01:42:06.735 --> 01:42:08.597]  Where you torture people to get answers out of them.
[01:42:08.597 --> 01:42:10.258]  I just saw another one last night.
[01:42:10.258 --> 01:42:13.721]  We had up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:42:13.721 --> 01:42:14.922]  A link to it.
[01:42:14.922 --> 01:42:16.523]  Where you kill civilians.
[01:42:16.523 --> 01:42:20.326]  And they got video games where you rape women and kill them and get bonus money.
[01:42:20.326 --> 01:42:23.269]  And you're just all being turned into psychopathic animals.
[01:42:23.269 --> 01:42:28.173]  And all the psychopathic low-level animals who enjoy torturing in raw power.
[01:42:28.173 --> 01:42:33.938]  Don't you understand that the higher level psychopaths are soft killing you with what they're putting in your water and shots and food?
[01:42:35.672 --> 01:42:38.074]  Speaking of whistleblowers, I've had all these top scientists on.
[01:42:38.074 --> 01:42:39.555]  It's been years.
[01:42:39.555 --> 01:42:43.818]  I kind of, for a year or so, did this big jag.
[01:42:43.818 --> 01:42:50.682]  I got off on a jag, exposing what's in the vaccines and also what was in the GMO food.
[01:42:50.682 --> 01:42:52.584]  And I had scientists after scientists on.
[01:42:52.584 --> 01:42:56.847]  One guy was part owner of the company, the top genetic engineer in England.
[01:42:56.847 --> 01:43:00.309]  He was making, according to the newspapers, four million dollars a year on average.
[01:43:00.309 --> 01:43:01.410]  He's making four million bucks!
[01:43:02.981 --> 01:43:09.262]  Then they wanted him to approve potatoes that sterilized every mammal they fed it to.
[01:43:09.262 --> 01:43:14.803]  And he noticed they'd gone in and altered some of the genes and that they just said, go ahead and approve it in their internal.
[01:43:14.803 --> 01:43:20.644]  And he said, no, I can't ship a potato out that sterilizes rats, mice, guinea pigs, ferrets.
[01:43:20.644 --> 01:43:29.006]  It will mess with the with the fertility of humans.
[01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:32.970]  And he said, I don't know what you've done to this.
[01:43:32.970 --> 01:43:35.151]  He started investigating and they pulled him off the case.
[01:43:35.151 --> 01:43:37.712]  But the point, it was all over the British news.
[01:43:37.712 --> 01:43:40.572]  He first went public in 96 about it and was vindicated five years later.
[01:43:40.572 --> 01:43:46.754]  In, uh, was it 2002?
[01:43:46.754 --> 01:43:49.875]  First went public in 96.
[01:43:49.875 --> 01:43:54.796]  And it sterilized males, it sterilized females.
[01:43:54.796 --> 01:43:55.996]  It was not an accident.
[01:43:55.996 --> 01:43:57.836]  And there's case after case.
[01:43:57.836 --> 01:43:59.577]  Don't you understand what's being done to you?
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:01.560]  It's not cute.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:02.241]  It's not funny.
[01:44:02.241 --> 01:44:10.464]  I mean, if you caught me in your house injecting a potato with something that would sterilize you, you would probably shoot me, and you should.
[01:44:10.464 --> 01:44:21.829]  If you caught somebody else in your house poisoning your food, you'd probably grab a butcher knife out of the butcher block, if you had your head screwed on straight, and start stabbing me with it.
[01:44:21.829 --> 01:44:26.891]  But see, your will to survive, your will to stand up, your will to
[01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:29.832]  Get involved has been destroyed.
[01:44:29.832 --> 01:44:32.814]  And in England and in Chicago and New York and other select U.S.
[01:44:32.814 --> 01:44:41.582]  cities, if somebody breaks in your house and you shoot them with an illegal gun you've hidden, even if they're raping you and your wife or attacking you, many cases of that, you go to prison.
[01:44:41.582 --> 01:44:46.306]  They throw the book at you and you spend more time in jail than the would-be attacker.
[01:44:46.306 --> 01:44:48.848]  They get to sue you and end up owning your house.
[01:44:48.848 --> 01:44:51.150]  And I saw an article yesterday out of England
[01:44:52.298 --> 01:44:59.102]  Where this 14-year-old and his 16-year-old cousin had robbed this guy's mother over and over again.
[01:44:59.102 --> 01:45:08.347]  And so, he went and stayed with her a few days, and when they robbed her the next time, they got in a fight, and he stabbed one of them, and the 14-year-old died, and now he's been charged with murder.
[01:45:08.347 --> 01:45:15.411]  And of course, there's the famous case of the gypsies robbing this guy three times, this old farmer, and he had an old hidden shotgun from his daddy.
[01:45:17.273 --> 01:45:21.435]  Illegally, and he shot one and hurt him, and he went to prison.
[01:45:21.435 --> 01:45:23.696]  I think he spent over a decade, he just got out.
[01:45:23.696 --> 01:45:24.716]  We need to get him on.
[01:45:24.716 --> 01:45:27.677]  He just got out, we should get him on.
[01:45:27.677 --> 01:45:30.459]  And they sued him and won, the guy he shot.
[01:45:30.459 --> 01:45:33.560]  You know, criminals now get on top of your house, fall through your skylight.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:45.325]  Every few months I hear about a criminal falling down the stairs, or falling through your skylight, or falling off your fire escape, and because there wasn't a warning sign on the stairs, or a warning sign on the skylight, they sue and win!
[01:45:46.932 --> 01:45:51.713]  I saw a report where this guy killed an ice cream truck manufacturer.
[01:45:51.713 --> 01:46:02.757]  He went in his house, gunned him down and killed him, and then now he's suing the ice cream truck company and just won a preliminary case.
[01:46:02.757 --> 01:46:05.817]  That's how it works in America.
[01:46:05.817 --> 01:46:08.498]  Someone kills you and then wins in court against you.
[01:46:08.498 --> 01:46:09.999]  It's all meant for criminals.
[01:46:09.999 --> 01:46:14.220]  That's why all over the news they report half of Congress or more doesn't pay taxes.
[01:46:16.909 --> 01:46:26.035]  In the last decade, they've taken almost all the FBI agents off of real white-collar millionaire and billionaire crime and put it on blue-collar.
[01:46:26.035 --> 01:46:28.076]  $25,000, $23,000 a year.
[01:46:28.076 --> 01:46:29.757]  That was in the news again Monday.
[01:46:29.757 --> 01:46:34.800]  They cut even more of the FBI and Secret Service off of the white-collar criminals.
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:37.642]  Because they write the rules, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:46:37.642 --> 01:46:38.863]  That's tyranny!
[01:46:38.863 --> 01:46:42.726]  Tyranny is when criminals take over the government.
[01:46:42.726 --> 01:46:50.532]  And these criminals are so evil, they say, hey, let's poison and drug and dumb everybody down, because people will wake up and fight us if we don't.
[01:46:50.532 --> 01:46:51.973]  What's the best thing to put in all the water?
[01:46:51.973 --> 01:46:53.334]  Well, fluoride's great.
[01:46:53.334 --> 01:46:59.399]  It brain damages you, makes you lethargic, makes you passive, gives you cancer, sterilizes you.
[01:46:59.399 --> 01:47:00.040]  Hell yeah!
[01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:02.941]  Oh, the Soviets are doing it in 1931?
[01:47:02.941 --> 01:47:04.301]  Oh, Hitler did it?
[01:47:04.301 --> 01:47:09.463]  Oh, my goodness, let's put it in the water in 1947 in the U.S.!
[01:47:09.463 --> 01:47:13.464]  I've got a Pulitzer Prize winning book on World War II with Hitler putting it in the water!
[01:47:13.464 --> 01:47:17.425]  I mean, it's not hard here, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:47:17.425 --> 01:47:19.285]  Alright, I said I'm going to your calls in the news.
[01:47:19.285 --> 01:47:22.466]  It's just... It's simple.
[01:47:22.466 --> 01:47:24.247]  I live in Austin, Texas.
[01:47:24.247 --> 01:47:24.547]  Take...
[01:47:26.926 --> 01:47:28.028]  They call it fluoride.
[01:47:28.028 --> 01:47:29.730]  It's hundreds of chemicals they put in the water.
[01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:32.534]  We've been given a tour, they've admitted it.
[01:47:32.534 --> 01:47:34.176]  It's all these deadly chemicals.
[01:47:34.176 --> 01:47:37.941]  Take it out of my water!
[01:47:37.941 --> 01:47:39.083]  Take it out of my water!
[01:47:39.083 --> 01:47:40.344]  Get it out of my water!
[01:47:41.667 --> 01:47:49.009]  Don't tell me it's good for my teeth thanks to all the lawsuits and top EPA toxicologists and head of their unions suing and going public.
[01:47:49.009 --> 01:47:59.893]  Three years ago, the American Dental Association said children shouldn't brush with fluoride toothpaste because it causes dental fluorosis, weakening of the teeth, and bone cancer.
[01:47:59.893 --> 01:48:05.235]  I mean, did you know the American Dental Association says don't brush your teeth with fluoride if you're under the age of five?
[01:48:07.619 --> 01:48:11.440]  Did you know the American Medical Association says that now?
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:20.982]  I mean, they've been forced to admit it makes your teeth get yellow spots all over them, dental fluorosis, and weakens your bones and teeth!
[01:48:20.982 --> 01:48:23.423]  It doesn't even do what they say it does!
[01:48:23.423 --> 01:48:25.323]  It's forced medication!
[01:48:25.323 --> 01:48:27.384]  That's what this stinking vaccine is.
[01:48:27.384 --> 01:48:29.805]  Look at their other forced medication, fluoride.
[01:48:29.805 --> 01:48:31.105]  Again, the catch name, fluoride.
[01:48:32.173 --> 01:48:34.514]  Some cities put 350-something chemicals in.
[01:48:34.514 --> 01:48:35.495]  Other cities put only 156 in.
[01:48:35.495 --> 01:48:38.757]  Austin puts 220-something.
[01:48:38.757 --> 01:48:39.797]  We got the terror.
[01:48:39.797 --> 01:48:41.198]  Rob Dew went.
[01:48:41.198 --> 01:48:42.739]  We went and took us months to get it.
[01:48:42.739 --> 01:48:45.320]  We got the terror of the stinking facility.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:49.963]  And they said, turn your cameras off, and said, yeah, we don't like it either.
[01:48:49.963 --> 01:48:53.505]  And they said, look at how it eats holes in the concrete.
[01:48:53.505 --> 01:48:57.487]  If we even spill a drop of it, it eats holes in the concrete.
[01:48:57.487 --> 01:48:58.388]  And see, here's the deal.
[01:48:58.388 --> 01:49:00.789]  It's a cumulative poison.
[01:49:01.926 --> 01:49:03.546]  And it's binary.
[01:49:03.546 --> 01:49:15.370]  Once you have these fluoride molecule chains in your bones, they build up and start binding to other similar free radicals and Grignard reagents and heavy metals.
[01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:17.390]  I mean, it puts a matrix.
[01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:20.351]  Fluoride has one of the smallest molecules in existence.
[01:49:20.351 --> 01:49:21.891]  It goes through almost everything.
[01:49:21.891 --> 01:49:23.092]  Every filter you can imagine.
[01:49:23.092 --> 01:49:23.492]  You name it.
[01:49:25.390 --> 01:49:30.355]  And now they want to spray it on crops as a pesticide because bugs will die if they eat it.
[01:49:30.355 --> 01:49:34.539]  They'll die just walking around on grapes or wheat.
[01:49:34.539 --> 01:49:37.382]  You can just Google, fluoride to be used as pesticides.
[01:49:37.382 --> 01:49:41.126]  For two years they've had approval and are spraying it on the stinking food.
[01:49:41.126 --> 01:49:45.090]  It goes right through the plant's skin and precipitates in it.
[01:49:47.478 --> 01:49:48.518]  And you still love it.
[01:49:48.518 --> 01:49:51.579]  Cops are driving around laughing right now.
[01:49:51.579 --> 01:49:55.200]  It's real funny, isn't it?
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:57.901]  Now, I know a lot of you actually go look up the information I talk about.
[01:49:57.901 --> 01:49:58.521]  Now you're awake.
[01:49:58.521 --> 01:49:59.702]  That's good.
[01:49:59.702 --> 01:50:11.465]  But for those of you that supposedly are the front line serving the system, you may not be a criminal, but the people you work for are the most diabolical, evil people the planet has ever seen.
[01:50:11.465 --> 01:50:13.506]  Two words.
[01:50:13.506 --> 01:50:14.206]  Write it down.
[01:50:15.505 --> 01:50:20.509]  Scientific dictatorship.
[01:50:20.509 --> 01:50:21.469]  Another word.
[01:50:21.469 --> 01:50:22.810]  Eugenics.
[01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:24.211]  Another term.
[01:50:24.211 --> 01:50:27.153]  Soft kill weapons.
[01:50:27.153 --> 01:50:28.294]  Another term.
[01:50:28.294 --> 01:50:29.915]  Bionary weapons.
[01:50:29.915 --> 01:50:31.896]  Here, this is your homework this weekend.
[01:50:31.896 --> 01:50:36.039]  If you're not like a 50-year-old man dressing up like a little kid running around in costumes.
[01:50:36.039 --> 01:50:38.621]  That's not what men are supposed to be doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:39.673 --> 01:50:41.695]  Getting drunk and being a bunch of slovenly idiots.
[01:50:41.695 --> 01:50:44.359]  Why don't you wake up and do some research this weekend?
[01:50:44.359 --> 01:50:49.024]  Why don't you get up off your fat butts and save your family?
[01:50:49.024 --> 01:50:50.906]  Soft kill weapon.
[01:50:50.906 --> 01:50:53.469]  Binary weapon.
[01:50:53.469 --> 01:50:56.473]  Silent weapons for quiet wars.
[01:50:56.473 --> 01:50:57.975]  Eugenics.
[01:50:57.975 --> 01:50:58.876]  Your call, straight ahead.
[01:50:58.876 --> 01:50:59.396]  A ton of news.
[01:50:59.396 --> 01:50:59.737]  Stay with us.
[01:51:04.332 --> 01:51:07.553]  Times are tough, and many of us expect them to get worse.
[01:51:07.553 --> 01:51:10.734]  The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[01:51:10.734 --> 01:51:13.715]  Therefore, you have no excuse not to be prepared.
[01:51:13.715 --> 01:51:20.136]  If another Great Depression strikes America, how will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones?
[01:51:20.136 --> 01:51:23.677]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food.
[01:51:23.677 --> 01:51:25.518]  Patriotfood.com is different.
[01:51:25.905 --> 01:51:30.186]  Because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[01:51:30.186 --> 01:51:37.288]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty, food-grade plastic bags that will last 10 years.
[01:51:37.288 --> 01:51:39.489]  While our competition charges $3,000, we ship to you 135 pounds
[01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:46.472]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:51:46.472 --> 01:51:48.973]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:51:48.973 --> 01:51:50.754]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:52:10.658 --> 01:52:13.319]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:13.319 --> 01:52:19.720]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:25.261]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:25.261 --> 01:52:34.883]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:35.003 --> 01:52:37.364]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:37.364 --> 01:52:38.944]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:38.944 --> 01:52:41.405]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:41.405 --> 01:52:43.525]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:43.525 --> 01:52:48.686]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:48.686 --> 01:52:53.688]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:52:53.688 --> 01:52:57.789]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:00.037 --> 01:53:00.937]  You worry.
[01:53:00.937 --> 01:53:02.998]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:53:02.998 --> 01:53:05.640]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.761]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:53:07.761 --> 01:53:09.381]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:53:09.381 --> 01:53:12.963]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:53:12.963 --> 01:53:18.205]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:53:18.205 --> 01:53:21.507]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:53:22.179 --> 01:53:23.861]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:53:23.861 --> 01:53:26.763]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:53:26.763 --> 01:53:30.226]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:53:30.226 --> 01:53:38.874]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:53:38.874 --> 01:53:43.698]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[01:53:47.722 --> 01:53:48.583]  Or if you're not online,
[01:53:48.883 --> 01:53:53.526]  Call her 24-hour toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:56.928]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:53:56.928 --> 01:54:04.453]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:54:04.453 --> 01:54:14.640]  My final point about the poisoning of our food and water is the fact that three years ago,
[01:54:16.266 --> 01:54:37.595]  Close to 95% of all EPA scientists and toxicologists, and we've had the head of their union on, sent letters certified to the head of the EPA and to the White House saying what is known as fluoride being put in the water is a combination of hundreds of deadly chemicals.
[01:54:37.595 --> 01:54:39.135]  You can go pull that report up.
[01:54:39.135 --> 01:54:43.577]  EPA scientists send letter concerning fluoride to EPA.
[01:54:46.274 --> 01:54:48.136]  We've had him on the show, we should have him back.
[01:54:48.136 --> 01:54:51.738]  It's been over a year.
[01:54:51.738 --> 01:54:57.743]  You're being forcibly medicated.
[01:54:57.743 --> 01:55:07.271]  And it should anger you, but you're sedated, so it's hard to get angry, isn't it?
[01:55:07.271 --> 01:55:11.334]  And there's so many examples of this, and now they want to force their vaccines on us.
[01:55:11.334 --> 01:55:13.136]  John in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:55:15.646 --> 01:55:30.913]  Well, I just want to let you know that, first of all, I took a whole stack of 25 Fall Republics, an amazing movie, and took it to my local police station with a box of cookies, dropped it off to the guy, and said, please give it out to your guys.
[01:55:30.913 --> 01:55:37.476]  It's very important that they watch it and understand what they're saying in this movie.
[01:55:37.476 --> 01:55:42.219]  What did the public servant at the front desk say to you?
[01:55:42.219 --> 01:55:44.540]  Well, he was really taken aback, and first he tried to be like,
[01:55:45.583 --> 01:55:48.464]  Copywritten or anything, and I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:55:48.464 --> 01:55:54.085]  It's, you know, the guy who makes it, he's a real American, and he puts it out for everybody to distribute it.
[01:55:54.085 --> 01:55:57.506]  So, um, you know, please hand it out to your guys.
[01:55:57.506 --> 01:55:58.727]  Here's some cookies.
[01:55:58.727 --> 01:56:00.327]  Thank you for all your service.
[01:56:00.327 --> 01:56:10.810]  You know, I never had a problem with the police, but I also want to make sure that when they clamp down, you know, they understand that they're violating their oath and everything.
[01:56:10.810 --> 01:56:13.391]  Well, great job, and so you gave him 25 copies, John.
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:25.308]  Yeah, it's a small little police right outside of Philadelphia, so I think there's only 10 or 15 guys there, but I hope that they have someone to pass them out to other people as well.
[01:56:25.308 --> 01:56:34.556]  I was also wondering if maybe in the near future you might be able to get somebody on who is an expert in preparedness?
[01:56:34.556 --> 01:56:44.084]  You know, because I do think that even if we do start to fight back, these guys aren't going to go down without a fight, and I'd like to have someone who knows about
[01:56:45.942 --> 01:56:54.150]  Well, there's all sorts of preparedness.
[01:56:54.150 --> 01:56:58.554]  I mean, the biggest thing is to be politically prepared to take our country back.
[01:56:58.554 --> 01:57:00.836]  But we do have to hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[01:57:00.836 --> 01:57:02.437]  But I do appreciate your call.
[01:57:02.437 --> 01:57:03.838]  Good to hear from you, John.
[01:57:03.838 --> 01:57:05.100]  Bob in Pennsylvania.
[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:05.980]  You're on the air, Bob.
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:08.383]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:57:08.383 --> 01:57:08.603]  Good.
[01:57:10.134 --> 01:57:20.480]  I just wanted to call to encourage you because I know a lot of people that do things like you, not what you do, but maybe in other fields.
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:30.726]  Sometimes we all get discouraged, but I just wanted to call in as a testimony on how I found you and your show and how it just totally turned my life around the last couple of months.
[01:57:30.726 --> 01:57:36.189]  I was just sitting around one day and I was watching all the crap on TV they put on what happened on 9-11.
[01:57:38.368 --> 01:57:47.894]  And when I first looked at that, I'm a very conservative kind of guy, so I just looked at all that stuff and was like, conspiracy people like a bunch of liberal idiots.
[01:57:47.894 --> 01:58:07.206]  And then one day I found myself sitting around, you know, I'm a very serious kind of Christian guy, so, you know, I'm not trying to put that in the mix, but I actually just started praying, and I asked the Lord to show me some truth about all this, because I was kind of concerned about the future and all that, and I'm not kidding you.
[01:58:07.921 --> 01:58:08.822]  No exaggeration.
[01:58:08.822 --> 01:58:12.926]  It came up, started Googling stuff, and it just happened.
[01:58:12.926 --> 01:58:14.068]  I found this movie.
[01:58:14.068 --> 01:58:15.169]  You probably heard of it.
[01:58:15.169 --> 01:58:17.151]  It was, uh, The Greatest Lie Ever Sold.
[01:58:17.151 --> 01:58:18.272]  That was the first thing I found.
[01:58:18.272 --> 01:58:19.393]  I don't know how good that was.
[01:58:19.393 --> 01:58:19.974]  It's pretty good.
[01:58:19.974 --> 01:58:21.616]  Anthony J. Hilder.
[01:58:21.616 --> 01:58:28.824]  Yeah, I found it to be pretty good, but I just... I didn't like how they put the music and the, uh, the, the kind of...
[01:58:29.582 --> 01:58:29.863]  Why?
[01:58:29.863 --> 01:58:32.246]  Because I found a lot of people getting mad at me.
[01:58:41.138 --> 01:58:46.845]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:46.845 --> 01:58:50.630]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:50.630 --> 01:58:59.701]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:58:59.761 --> 01:59:03.122]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:59:03.122 --> 01:59:08.984]  Instead, use vitamin CD and oxysilver, along with zeolife, for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:59:08.984 --> 01:59:13.765]  Using NASA science, oxysilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:59:13.765 --> 01:59:25.469]  Oxysilver safely electrocutes pathogens, oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:31.132]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[01:59:53.797 --> 01:59:56.178]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.178 --> 02:00:05.563]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.563 --> 02:00:06.863]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.863 --> 02:00:08.644]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.644 --> 02:00:10.365]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.365 --> 02:00:11.986]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.986 --> 02:00:13.547]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.547 --> 02:00:17.709]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.709 --> 02:00:20.050]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:20.954 --> 02:00:40.687]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:40.687 --> 02:00:42.688]  We are back live, taking your phone calls.
[02:00:42.688 --> 02:00:46.451]  Bob Chapman to go over this week in the economy, coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:47.250 --> 02:00:49.252]  We're going to continue with calls throughout the broadcast.
[02:00:49.252 --> 02:00:52.795]  Got a lot of other news on the 1,900-page healthcare nightmare.
[02:00:52.795 --> 02:00:54.797]  Worse than we even thought.
[02:00:54.797 --> 02:00:59.201]  The Democrats and Republicans are such liars, but the Democrats bring it to another level.
[02:00:59.201 --> 02:01:00.943]  Let's go ahead and go back to Bob.
[02:01:00.943 --> 02:01:02.644]  Bob, you were talking about your awakening.
[02:01:02.644 --> 02:01:03.005]  Go ahead.
[02:01:03.806 --> 02:01:04.986]  Yes, Alex.
[02:01:04.986 --> 02:01:08.648]  If I was standing there with you, I'd give you the biggest hug I ever could.
[02:01:08.648 --> 02:01:14.530]  The first couple of days when I saw your material, I sat in tears for what's happening to this country.
[02:01:14.530 --> 02:01:17.732]  Then my wife came home from work and she didn't really understand.
[02:01:17.732 --> 02:01:20.833]  Then I sat her down and we watched Endgame.
[02:01:20.833 --> 02:01:21.673]  She's so smart.
[02:01:21.673 --> 02:01:22.874]  She traveled the whole world.
[02:01:22.874 --> 02:01:25.335]  Her dad was in the Navy and she worked for a dentist.
[02:01:25.335 --> 02:01:27.455]  She was like, I don't believe it.
[02:01:27.455 --> 02:01:30.117]  She couldn't believe the information.
[02:01:30.117 --> 02:01:31.017]  You must be so
[02:01:32.188 --> 02:01:33.488]  I don't know what to call you.
[02:01:33.488 --> 02:01:37.870]  I mean, I never saw anybody investigate so much stuff and be so on the money.
[02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:42.171]  See, people need to know that they can check out what you're saying.
[02:01:42.171 --> 02:01:46.912]  Just like a pastor of a church says, don't take my word, go research it.
[02:01:46.912 --> 02:01:47.873]  Be a Berean.
[02:01:47.873 --> 02:01:49.473]  And guess what?
[02:01:49.473 --> 02:01:55.035]  Your information is absolutely astonishing.
[02:01:55.035 --> 02:01:57.936]  But I know, I just know that it's 100% true because
[02:01:59.306 --> 02:02:01.827]  When I became a Christian, I wasn't born into Christianity.
[02:02:01.827 --> 02:02:03.467]  I came out of the rock and roll business.
[02:02:03.467 --> 02:02:11.230]  I played on albums, hung around with all kinds of people, came out of the music thing, became a Christian, and it's the same thing.
[02:02:11.230 --> 02:02:12.911]  The light switch goes on.
[02:02:12.911 --> 02:02:20.693]  It just went on, and I saw it, and I thought, wow, I played about this, and I thought, well, God wouldn't confuse you.
[02:02:20.693 --> 02:02:24.395]  And I just asked him, I thought, man, I would like wisdom, you know?
[02:02:24.395 --> 02:02:28.036]  Well, Bob, I appreciate your comments, but let's be clear.
[02:02:29.588 --> 02:02:30.809]  I do make mistakes.
[02:02:30.809 --> 02:02:36.832]  Every once in a while we're wrong, but it's an accident and we always come back and correct it.
[02:02:36.832 --> 02:02:50.621]  The difference is the mainstream controlled corporate press and the government are trying to twist and spin and lie and manipulate things, mixing truth with lies, and people think sometimes I exaggerate.
[02:02:50.621 --> 02:02:51.661]  No!
[02:02:51.661 --> 02:02:57.065]  Nine times out of ten, the only disinformation I put out, I find, in hindsight,
[02:02:57.984 --> 02:03:03.631]  Is that it's normally, literally nine times out of ten, worse than I first said.
[02:03:03.631 --> 02:03:07.035]  So as bad as it sounds, I mean here's an example.
[02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:09.349]  I'm not going to lie.
[02:03:09.349 --> 02:03:33.015]  I'm not going to get up here on air and say Bayer Pharmaceutical worked with the Nazis, and Bayer Pharmaceutical from the mid-80s until the late 90s knew that their Factor VIII blood product for hemophiliacs had HIV in it, and hepatitis, and that they knew it was going to kill people, and they knew it was in it and still shipped it out, not just for profit, but for eugenics.
[02:03:33.975 --> 02:03:46.108]  I'm only pointing out what MSNBC and Associated Press have already reported, but they just calmly report it and then don't connect it in to, well then why do we trust a company that does this to make our vaccines?
[02:03:46.108 --> 02:03:49.011]  I then just add the common sense statement at the end.
[02:03:49.011 --> 02:03:54.757]  So I would be sued out of complete existence if I just got up here
[02:03:55.738 --> 02:04:03.622]  And said, the flu vaccine can brain damage you, sterilize you, give you cancer, and has mercury in it.
[02:04:03.622 --> 02:04:05.823]  I'm reading FDA.gov!
[02:04:05.823 --> 02:04:08.004]  I mean, I'm not doing something that special!
[02:04:08.004 --> 02:04:19.870]  I mean, I've got the government textbooks for high-level policymakers where they say they're going to break up our families and how they're going to take our children away from us, and how they've got that process going.
[02:04:20.730 --> 02:04:22.812]  And now England's about five years ahead of us.
[02:04:22.812 --> 02:04:24.913]  We can clearly see that it's true what's in there.
[02:04:24.913 --> 02:04:28.275]  I mean, sir, all I'm doing is reading the TV Guide here.
[02:04:28.275 --> 02:04:30.056]  Yeah, I mean, that's the big secret.
[02:04:30.056 --> 02:04:33.078]  I just don't, I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[02:04:33.078 --> 02:04:37.221]  A lot of people love to speculate and make up new conspiracies for attention.
[02:04:37.221 --> 02:04:40.063]  We stick to meat and potatoes, Bob.
[02:04:41.539 --> 02:04:51.528]  And reality is always crazier and scarier and wilder than made-up stuff about chupacabras and abominable snowmen and Easter bunnies.
[02:04:51.528 --> 02:04:54.190]  Sir, I appreciate your call and God bless you.
[02:04:54.190 --> 02:04:55.151]  Good to have you on the team.
[02:04:55.151 --> 02:04:56.933]  I'm glad you're fully awakened.
[02:04:56.933 --> 02:04:58.915]  Many more calls and Bob Shatman straight ahead.
[02:05:00.543 --> 02:05:03.925]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.925 --> 02:05:07.548]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.548 --> 02:05:12.111]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.111 --> 02:05:17.715]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:17.995 --> 02:05:22.780]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:26.403]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.403 --> 02:05:31.208]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.208 --> 02:05:37.775]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.775 --> 02:05:39.737]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.197 --> 02:05:43.398]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.398 --> 02:05:47.900]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:50.121]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.121 --> 02:05:50.442]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.442 --> 02:05:51.162]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:01.172 --> 02:06:04.193]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.193 --> 02:06:09.516]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.516 --> 02:06:11.556]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.556 --> 02:06:16.559]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.559 --> 02:06:17.739]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.739 --> 02:06:18.880]  When do you want it?
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:20.760]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:21.821]  When will you need it?
[02:06:21.821 --> 02:06:24.022]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.022 --> 02:06:25.362]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.362 --> 02:06:26.683]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:26.883 --> 02:06:32.149]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:35.754]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.754 --> 02:06:39.578]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.578 --> 02:06:40.799]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.799 --> 02:06:41.700]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:42.822]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.822 --> 02:06:43.743]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.743 --> 02:06:44.544]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.804 --> 02:06:47.868]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:47.868 --> 02:06:50.110]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:50.110 --> 02:06:51.071]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.123 --> 02:07:05.450]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:09.976]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:09.976 --> 02:07:12.239]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.239 --> 02:07:13.861]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:13.861 --> 02:07:14.903]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.123 --> 02:07:23.547]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:07:23.547 --> 02:07:31.010]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:37.052]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:07:37.052 --> 02:07:42.635]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:07:43.055 --> 02:07:47.198]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:07:47.198 --> 02:07:53.904]  Go to E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com or give them a call right now.
[02:07:53.904 --> 02:07:54.665]  866-762-9238.
[02:07:54.665 --> 02:08:00.910]  Click on their banner at Infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:06.334]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.334 --> 02:08:08.596]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.265 --> 02:08:16.848]  Our police are being taught to be political officers.
[02:08:16.848 --> 02:08:20.210]  In the Soviet Union, they were called commisars.
[02:08:20.210 --> 02:08:22.291]  Part of the commissariat.
[02:08:22.291 --> 02:08:27.935]  And they spent most of their time marking down what people said and did, getting neighbors to spy on each other.
[02:08:27.935 --> 02:08:31.877]  They had all these different excuses of why it was a good thing.
[02:08:31.877 --> 02:08:40.763]  Going back over a decade ago, police and military and others would send us training manuals, training flyers, videos of FEMA,
[02:08:41.846 --> 02:08:48.949]  And other federal organizations saying the founding fathers are bad, gun owners are bad, George Washington was a terrorist.
[02:08:48.949 --> 02:08:55.092]  We have a clip of FEMA teaching Kansas City police, firemen, and sheriff's deputies in Fall of the Republic.
[02:08:55.092 --> 02:08:56.053]  We have them teaching this.
[02:08:56.053 --> 02:08:58.074]  Video of FEMA teaching them this.
[02:08:58.074 --> 02:09:02.216]  And you saw the first thing they did when the feds were in control of New Orleans and surrounding areas.
[02:09:02.216 --> 02:09:10.260]  They went in even high and dry safe areas, people at their own million dollar homes in many cases, and took their firearms and put them in handcuffs.
[02:09:11.974 --> 02:09:14.715]  We can play those ABC News clips again if you'd like to see them.
[02:09:14.715 --> 02:09:17.097]  They're all over YouTube.
[02:09:17.097 --> 02:09:19.618]  And earlier this year we broke the MIAC report.
[02:09:19.618 --> 02:09:27.282]  We broke the Homeland Security report saying Ron Paul supporters, American flag, bumper stickers, the Gadsden flag.
[02:09:29.431 --> 02:09:30.672]  That says, don't tread on me.
[02:09:30.672 --> 02:09:33.093]  This is all terrorism, they said.
[02:09:33.093 --> 02:09:43.260]  And we have the John Elway Homeland Security videos where they say, workmen, telephone repair people, if you're in someone's house and see guns or gold, they may be terrorists.
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:45.181]  Call the terrorism hotline.
[02:09:45.181 --> 02:09:49.004]  And we have a clip of a Homeland Security produced video.
[02:09:49.004 --> 02:09:50.025]  We've aired the whole thing here.
[02:09:50.025 --> 02:09:54.848]  It's 15 minutes long, but a couple of clips in Fall of the Republic, my new film that was released last week.
[02:09:56.255 --> 02:10:05.062]  Where they're saying if somebody has a cell phone or binoculars or a camera, go ahead and question them and put them in the terror database.
[02:10:05.062 --> 02:10:13.569]  And that's why I can be in Kansas City, happen to my crew at a city park, or we can be in DC or New York or Miami or LA.
[02:10:13.569 --> 02:10:16.552]  Police walk up and say, driver's license, why are you here with a camera?
[02:10:16.552 --> 02:10:20.915]  And we can be, we're showing homeless people in Los Angeles.
[02:10:20.915 --> 02:10:22.296]  Well, why are you, who are you with?
[02:10:22.296 --> 02:10:23.958]  And then they go and they put you in a database.
[02:10:25.626 --> 02:10:26.626]  You're a criminal.
[02:10:26.626 --> 02:10:27.827]  You're bad.
[02:10:27.827 --> 02:10:31.809]  You're being put on a secret list that's undemocratic and there's no due process.
[02:10:31.809 --> 02:10:46.556]  Remember two years ago, the head of one of the major unions, he was the head of the major district out of Denver for several states, the head federal marshal went public and said, we're ordered to put hundreds of innocent people on the terror list every month for life.
[02:10:47.336 --> 02:10:57.904]  Ruining their lives, now they say you won't be able to buy a gun if you're on that list, for ordering a vegetarian meal on a plane, or if a child takes a photo out the window.
[02:10:57.904 --> 02:11:01.246]  This is about getting everybody on list and setting the precedent for this.
[02:11:01.246 --> 02:11:05.129]  We're going to go to Bob Chapman in a moment and get his take on this, but I wanted to show you the latest thing we got.
[02:11:06.496 --> 02:11:18.207]  This is the Bureau of Justice Assistance, FBI, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Communities Against Terrorism, Potential Indicators of Terrorist Activities Related to Tattoo Shops.
[02:11:20.157 --> 02:11:25.240]  And they are asking the tattoo owners to make note of suspicious statements, people or vehicles.
[02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:27.481]  Watch for people and actions that are out of place.
[02:11:27.481 --> 02:11:31.223]  Talk to customers, ask questions, and listen and observe their responses.
[02:11:31.223 --> 02:11:34.205]  And see, they always start the program saying it's for Al-Qaeda.
[02:11:34.205 --> 02:11:44.530]  But once you show you're interested, they come to you and say, we actually want to fight veterans and gun owners, and that's come out that they're training the school kids for this, and it's in the New York Times saying how great it is.
[02:11:44.530 --> 02:11:46.872]  Require valid ID from all new customers.
[02:11:47.412 --> 02:11:51.222]  So they want everybody to show ID.
[02:11:51.222 --> 02:11:54.570]  Getting you ready for the cashless society.
[02:11:54.570 --> 02:11:56.915]  And it says, what should I consider suspicious?
[02:12:00.037 --> 02:12:03.621]  It says anyone that asks for identity privacy.
[02:12:03.621 --> 02:12:11.608]  Every time I go to stores now, I might try to buy $10 of batteries or $100 of bullets or a tent.
[02:12:11.608 --> 02:12:15.092]  I go to Academy, they want that zip code.
[02:12:15.092 --> 02:12:16.513]  They want that driver's license.
[02:12:16.513 --> 02:12:17.694]  All these other businesses want it.
[02:12:17.694 --> 02:12:18.735]  It's going in a database.
[02:12:18.735 --> 02:12:20.597]  They're selling it.
[02:12:20.597 --> 02:12:21.998]  Insist on paying with cash.
[02:12:23.648 --> 02:12:24.989]  Oh, cash, see?
[02:12:24.989 --> 02:12:27.350]  John Elway says gold's bad.
[02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:29.151]  And I have listeners all the time.
[02:12:29.151 --> 02:12:31.653]  We've had forum moderators.
[02:12:31.653 --> 02:12:44.340]  No criminal record, veterans, upstanding members of the community, they get SWAT teamed because they're trying to sell their house and the realtors see they have a gun case.
[02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:50.824]  And the police come!
[02:12:50.824 --> 02:12:52.385]  If they have missing fingers,
[02:12:57.338 --> 02:12:59.821]  And it says, or stains on their clothing.
[02:12:59.821 --> 02:13:01.282]  They're looking for methamphetamine, folks.
[02:13:01.282 --> 02:13:08.790]  But see, over and over again, I see these terror training reports given to farmers and big city business people and InfraGard.
[02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:11.072]  And they always say, send your truck drivers.
[02:13:11.072 --> 02:13:12.073]  It's over a million now.
[02:13:12.073 --> 02:13:12.954]  It was 500,000.
[02:13:12.954 --> 02:13:17.038]  A million truck drivers plus, because that number is about a year old.
[02:13:17.038 --> 02:13:19.080]  A million plus truck drivers have been trained.
[02:13:19.961 --> 02:13:21.582]  And they say, come to our seminar.
[02:13:21.582 --> 02:13:24.443]  We'll even give you an insurance discount with your insurance carrier.
[02:13:24.443 --> 02:13:27.424]  If you have all your truck drivers for your company, come to us.
[02:13:27.424 --> 02:13:29.405]  And then I've seen training videos of these.
[02:13:29.405 --> 02:13:30.766]  And it's even been on the news.
[02:13:30.766 --> 02:13:35.748]  And it'll be a weekend deal, paid for by the company and the FBI.
[02:13:35.748 --> 02:13:37.009]  And there's donuts and coffee.
[02:13:37.009 --> 02:13:38.990]  And they spend about 10 minutes on Al-Qaeda.
[02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:40.870]  They show an Al-Qaeda training video.
[02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:43.572]  And then next they say, is your neighbor spanking their kid?
[02:13:44.591 --> 02:13:47.332]  You see plants that look like this growing marijuana?
[02:13:47.332 --> 02:13:50.113]  Do you see somebody with a bag on their back walking on the highway?
[02:13:50.113 --> 02:13:52.294]  Go ahead and call Homeland Security.
[02:13:52.294 --> 02:13:55.995]  This is just priming the pump, training you to be spies and tattletales.
[02:13:55.995 --> 02:13:58.016]  They're five years ahead in England.
[02:13:58.016 --> 02:13:59.876]  They're now announcing what it's for.
[02:13:59.876 --> 02:14:01.377]  Total control of everybody.
[02:14:01.377 --> 02:14:05.278]  Parents won't be able to be in public with their children without a special government license.
[02:14:05.278 --> 02:14:10.480]  That is the London Telegraph.
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:13.321]  And you read this, Philadelphia Division, FBI.gov,
[02:14:16.052 --> 02:14:31.740]  The project number for the grant is MU-BX-K002.
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:39.224]  It's important to remember that just because someone's speech, actions, beliefs, and appearance or way of life is different, it does not mean that he or she is suspicious.
[02:14:39.224 --> 02:14:41.805]  So they have that at the end after they say, be a little spy.
[02:14:43.717 --> 02:14:46.038]  This is the secret police takeover of America.
[02:14:46.038 --> 02:15:03.244]  He died two years ago, but seven years ago, in 2002, Markus Wolf, the head of the former East German Stasi, the biggest police state ever, worse than Stalin, worse than Hitler, per capita, in that half of Eastern Germany, that half of Deutschland.
[02:15:03.244 --> 02:15:07.186]  They hired him, along with the former head of the KGB, Primakov.
[02:15:07.186 --> 02:15:09.787]  And when I saw this in the news, I didn't believe it.
[02:15:09.787 --> 02:15:10.667]  I couldn't believe it back then.
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:14.425]  This is a process for all of us to admit this.
[02:15:14.425 --> 02:15:21.097]  And I went and looked up the federal grants and he was paid a million bucks each year to come teach them how to get everybody spying on each other.
[02:15:22.759 --> 02:15:29.927]  But remember, the number one threat in their internal secret documents is gun owners, veterans, libertarians, and in-the-fed protesters.
[02:15:29.927 --> 02:15:33.170]  And I am surveilled, and Ron Paul is surveilled, that's been in the news.
[02:15:33.170 --> 02:15:38.836]  The Army watches me, because I know foreign offshore criminal banks have taken this country over.
[02:15:38.836 --> 02:15:41.279]  And the Army, when they do that, is engaged in treason.
[02:15:41.279 --> 02:15:42.220]  It's totally illegal!
[02:15:43.288 --> 02:15:48.492]  But so is Marines running checkpoints for drunk drivers nationwide, but they're just acclimating the public.
[02:15:48.492 --> 02:15:57.698]  Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com, former intelligence officer himself, one of the biggest silver and gold brokers at one time before he retired, had the biggest newsletter.
[02:15:57.698 --> 02:16:00.900]  He's now back, and it's good to have Bob on with us.
[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:09.066]  Bob, I just covered that because I wanted you to talk about it before we got into the economy and calls, but can you break down and elaborate or add to what I just said?
[02:16:10.376 --> 02:16:32.167]  Well, you're pretty comprehensive, but my own personal experience, we used to spy on Stasi, and the KGB, and the NKVD, and the mainline operators out of Moscow, and we even used to track armored units, and you name it, we did it.
[02:16:32.167 --> 02:16:34.088]  And we were really good at it.
[02:16:34.088 --> 02:16:37.450]  But what you say about Stasi is so true.
[02:16:37.450 --> 02:16:39.311]  I lived in Germany for several years,
[02:16:40.114 --> 02:16:41.795]  I spoke German.
[02:16:41.795 --> 02:16:47.680]  And Stasi was absolutely the worst of the worst.
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:49.462]  And when they, the U.S.
[02:16:49.462 --> 02:16:54.566]  government, hired Premikov and Wolf, I just really couldn't believe it.
[02:16:54.566 --> 02:16:56.568]  I was speechless.
[02:16:56.568 --> 02:16:59.830]  And so I knew what they were going to do, just like you did.
[02:16:59.830 --> 02:17:04.334]  But this is an example of a government of people who control government
[02:17:05.811 --> 02:17:14.313]  Setting up a situation where we could all spy on each other, and who better to learn from than the most wicked of the spies?
[02:17:14.313 --> 02:17:35.338]  And incidentally, what really floored me as well, after the merger in the early 90s of West and East Germany, none of the spies for East Germany and West Germany, nor none of the people who spied on other people within East Germany, were ever brought to trial.
[02:17:37.364 --> 02:17:39.205]  It's just incredible.
[02:17:39.205 --> 02:17:47.211]  And so, you know, it was like after the Second World War, when we had Mueller, one of the heads of the SS, working for the U.S.
[02:17:47.211 --> 02:17:48.852]  government.
[02:17:48.852 --> 02:17:54.655]  And he lived here for many years and then died and is buried in the San Francisco area.
[02:17:54.655 --> 02:18:00.959]  And so what does that tell you about the people behind the scenes?
[02:18:00.959 --> 02:18:04.542]  Years ago, we never realized what they were really up to.
[02:18:04.542 --> 02:18:06.183]  It tells you that they were in on it.
[02:18:07.543 --> 02:18:08.864]  They financed these people.
[02:18:08.864 --> 02:18:11.506]  They set these people up in business.
[02:18:11.506 --> 02:18:14.329]  I'm talking about the Russians, the East Germans, etc.
[02:18:14.329 --> 02:18:16.590]  Well, it's now, as you know, been declassified.
[02:18:16.590 --> 02:18:18.552]  London Guardian and other publications.
[02:18:18.552 --> 02:18:22.275]  Hitler was MI5 and so was Mussolini.
[02:18:22.275 --> 02:18:30.421]  And then we already have the Lord Milner Group in the 20s saying, we've got to put dictators in to wreck Europe, then we'll go have a war with them.
[02:18:30.421 --> 02:18:34.845]  And that's why Hitler thought he had a deal with England when he invaded Czechoslovakia.
[02:18:36.312 --> 02:18:42.920]  That's absolutely correct, and you know, Mussolini was paid in the 1920s a great deal of money.
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:46.044]  A hundred pounds a month was a lot of money.
[02:18:46.044 --> 02:18:52.032]  At that time, the pound was worth $4.75, and so that's almost five times
[02:18:53.090 --> 02:18:58.435]  One, that would be $500 a month.
[02:18:58.435 --> 02:19:01.938]  I believe the headline was he was paid that a week, but go ahead.
[02:19:01.938 --> 02:19:02.438]  A week?
[02:19:02.438 --> 02:19:04.880]  Well, that's even more astronomical.
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:06.782]  They must have really liked him.
[02:19:06.782 --> 02:19:15.549]  And if you've read any of Mussolini's works, which I have, you'll find out he went through the teens and the 20s as a communist.
[02:19:15.549 --> 02:19:17.731]  And then he became a fascist.
[02:19:17.731 --> 02:19:18.432]  Fascism was 1927 and beyond.
[02:19:22.014 --> 02:19:24.984]  But anyway, the point is well taken.
[02:19:24.984 --> 02:19:27.131]  This is what they had planned for us.
[02:19:27.131 --> 02:19:28.957]  This morning I was on CBS.
[02:19:29.651 --> 02:19:42.382]  In the moderator of the program, after I was telling the people the truth about what was going on with the economy, he said to me, you paint a very black picture.
[02:19:42.382 --> 02:19:47.706]  And I said, well, all I'm doing is coming here and telling you the truth.
[02:19:47.706 --> 02:19:49.628]  And that's all I'm interested in.
[02:19:49.628 --> 02:19:52.750]  And I can back up everything that I'm saying.
[02:19:52.750 --> 02:19:54.372]  And with that, they took me off the air.
[02:19:55.973 --> 02:19:57.094]  Bob Chapman, stay there.
[02:19:57.094 --> 02:20:01.217]  We're going to get into the economy, take phone calls, get into the health care bill.
[02:20:01.217 --> 02:20:02.417]  The once mighty U.S.
[02:20:02.417 --> 02:20:05.439]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[02:20:05.439 --> 02:20:08.121]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[02:20:08.121 --> 02:20:11.303]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[02:20:11.303 --> 02:20:15.586]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[02:20:15.586 --> 02:20:23.692]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders, and Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[02:20:23.692 --> 02:20:24.292]  Prepare now
[02:20:26.325 --> 02:20:26.685]  I think so.

[02:21:01.232 --> 02:21:03.394]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:03.394 --> 02:21:04.254]  Spy on me?
[02:21:04.254 --> 02:21:04.574]  Yeah.

[02:21:09.638 --> 02:21:11.259]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:21:11.259 --> 02:21:11.999]  Startpage?
[02:21:11.999 --> 02:21:12.420]  Yeah.

[02:23:04.522 --> 02:23:11.665]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[02:23:11.665 --> 02:23:16.987]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[02:23:16.987 --> 02:23:18.908]  Lucky for you, there's the freeze-dry guide.
[02:23:19.048 --> 02:23:25.531]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[02:23:25.531 --> 02:23:30.493]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[02:23:30.493 --> 02:23:39.818]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[02:23:39.818 --> 02:23:46.701]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[02:23:46.701 --> 02:23:47.241]  Comparably,
[02:23:47.301 --> 02:23:47.601]  Watch me!
[02:23:47.601 --> 02:23:48.222]  Watch me!
[02:23:48.222 --> 02:23:48.662]  I got it!
[02:23:48.662 --> 02:23:48.842]  Watch me!
[02:23:48.842 --> 02:23:49.042]  I got it!
[02:24:15.979 --> 02:24:18.221]  Okay, let's go back to Bob Chapman.
[02:24:18.221 --> 02:24:23.904]  Bob, I want to get into the stock market, the economy, gold, where all this is going.
[02:24:23.904 --> 02:24:25.745]  But first, I want to get into the health care bill.
[02:24:25.745 --> 02:24:27.967]  I haven't read the 1,900 pages.
[02:24:27.967 --> 02:24:30.669]  It was just made public, as you know, yesterday morning.
[02:24:30.669 --> 02:24:33.630]  But the Associated Press, Reuters, Fox...
[02:24:34.588 --> 02:24:40.473]  They're all reporting that, and the Democrats are proud of this, it does have the death panels that decide on the rationing.
[02:24:40.473 --> 02:24:41.194]  That's in there.
[02:24:41.194 --> 02:24:42.495]  Those are real.
[02:24:42.495 --> 02:24:45.157]  It does have, you know, they kept saying we're not going to have a public option.
[02:24:45.157 --> 02:24:46.298]  It's in there.
[02:24:46.298 --> 02:24:52.484]  It does have the $3,000 to $5,000 fines if you're 18 and don't want to go get health insurance.
[02:24:52.484 --> 02:24:57.368]  The insurance companies, the Wall Street Journal reports, and this was two weeks ago,
[02:24:59.907 --> 02:25:11.832]  Insurers stand against committee's plan, and then you read here, it's the spokesman for the insurance consortium, and they say, because we helped write the bill with bigger penalties, this doesn't have enough penalties.
[02:25:11.832 --> 02:25:17.254]  So it admits that they're actually for it, and now they're supporting it again.
[02:25:17.254 --> 02:25:25.557]  When Pelosi got called a Nazi for the death panels during her press conference, via someone that smuggled a bullhorn up close, they were quickly grabbed like they were a terrorist.
[02:25:26.517 --> 02:25:29.438]  She laughed and said, oh, there's somebody from the insurance companies.
[02:25:29.438 --> 02:25:37.439]  When it's big insurance doing this, as Ron Paul has said, your take on this monstrosity?
[02:25:37.439 --> 02:25:42.621]  Ron Paul is exactly correct.
[02:25:42.621 --> 02:25:53.583]  And they're going to try to ram this thing through, and it's up to us to get all over the House and the Senate and say we don't want this bill, and if we inundate them with enough
[02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:58.804]  Emails and phone calls and faxes and letters.
[02:25:58.804 --> 02:26:01.927]  Maybe we can do some good because you don't want this.
[02:26:01.927 --> 02:26:06.591]  It'll be an absolute nightmare.
[02:26:06.591 --> 02:26:11.116]  You know, Bob, I know they lie as a course of action, the mainstream media and government, but
[02:26:12.447 --> 02:26:14.828]  Is it just me or is the lying intensifying?
[02:26:14.828 --> 02:26:20.509]  Because just like the cap-and-trade bill the House has passed was worse than what we thought when we finally got it.
[02:26:20.509 --> 02:26:26.431]  This is worse than what we originally thought and they're busy lying saying it's wonderful.
[02:26:26.431 --> 02:26:31.192]  The arrogance and lying are getting greater and greater and greater.
[02:26:31.192 --> 02:26:32.472]  And why?
[02:26:32.472 --> 02:26:36.453]  Because their programs didn't easily go through.
[02:26:36.453 --> 02:26:38.354]  Cap-and-trade, as you mentioned.
[02:26:38.354 --> 02:26:39.834]  This medical program.
[02:26:41.687 --> 02:26:57.473]  And of course, what they've had to put up with, with HR 1207 and SB 604, in regard to the Federal Reserve and its auditing and investigation, they're beside themselves.
[02:26:57.473 --> 02:27:08.437]  Not only the people in Congress, but the people who are banging on their door every morning and saying, we've got to get this stuff passed, I don't care what you've got to do to make it happen, I don't care what it costs.
[02:27:09.392 --> 02:27:14.835]  And they're, you know, standing there with bushel baskets full of hundred dollar bills.
[02:27:14.835 --> 02:27:16.756]  And so they're desperate.
[02:27:16.756 --> 02:27:19.577]  They can't get this stuff passed.
[02:27:19.577 --> 02:27:26.181]  And so that's why they react the way that they do.
[02:27:26.181 --> 02:27:34.084]  And also lie and deceive like Mrs. Pelosi and saying, oh, it's the insurance companies.
[02:27:34.084 --> 02:27:38.147]  And as you pointed out, they're in on it.
[02:27:38.147 --> 02:27:38.807]  They're part of it.
[02:27:39.534 --> 02:27:41.620]  Well, that's just like the Federal Reserve, as you know.
[02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:47.037]  The private banks that own the private front company or holding company, they...
[02:27:49.301 --> 02:28:15.449]  are on record in history having the newspapers they owned run headlines as if the private banks were against the Federal Reserve when it actually gave them power over the monetary system and remove that from Congress unconstitutionally that was a trick they played and they do this over and it's like the oil companies are publicly financing the greenhouse gas tax on coal and the whole thing is their plan
[02:28:16.249 --> 02:28:26.634]  Because they're owned by the big banks on record, but then if you're against the global carbon tax, they claim you work for the oil companies when the stinking oil companies are the authors of it!
[02:28:26.634 --> 02:28:28.295]  Things aren't the way they seem to be.
[02:28:29.105 --> 02:28:42.592]  It's just like when Glenn Beck gives you 95% of the truth and then sets you off in the other direction with the propaganda and the misdirection and the other 5%, which I saw him do a couple of days ago on this China thing.
[02:28:42.592 --> 02:28:45.674]  But this is a great segue for me.
[02:28:45.674 --> 02:28:55.699]  One of the people who is fairly close to me, who is the owner of a large corporation,
[02:28:56.981 --> 02:29:11.495]  And they recently started to do business with a medium to upper-sized bank in the Midwest, because their original bank wouldn't lend them money anymore, and the company's loaded with money.
[02:29:11.495 --> 02:29:19.263]  I mean, they borrow money just because, you know, the bridge thing, so that they don't have to use money for other things.
[02:29:19.263 --> 02:29:21.085]  But anyway, the story is this.
[02:29:24.331 --> 02:29:25.191]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:29:25.191 --> 02:29:27.032]  We're going to get the story when we come back.
[02:29:27.032 --> 02:29:28.053]  Get into the economy.
[02:29:28.053 --> 02:29:31.094]  And my next issue, I know where this is going.
[02:29:31.094 --> 02:29:33.896]  I haven't heard the story yet.
[02:29:33.896 --> 02:29:40.199]  The big banks orchestrated the derivative scam to create fiat wealth to buy up infrastructure.
[02:29:40.199 --> 02:29:48.024]  Now, they're threatening to bring us into a depression if we don't give them unlimited power over all the smaller financial institutions.
[02:29:48.024 --> 02:29:49.925]  And so there's a huge consolidation happening.
[02:29:51.519 --> 02:29:55.447]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.447 --> 02:29:58.152]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.759 --> 02:30:07.742]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:30:07.742 --> 02:30:09.022]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:30:09.022 --> 02:30:09.843]  It's very real.
[02:30:09.843 --> 02:30:12.084]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:30:12.084 --> 02:30:13.724]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:30:13.724 --> 02:30:18.206]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:31:00.484 --> 02:31:05.025]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.025 --> 02:31:05.945]  Number one.
[02:31:05.945 --> 02:31:09.366]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.366 --> 02:31:10.226]  Number two.
[02:31:10.226 --> 02:31:15.108]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.108 --> 02:31:15.868]  It's true.
[02:31:15.868 --> 02:31:20.729]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.729 --> 02:31:21.569]  Number three.
[02:31:21.569 --> 02:31:25.150]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:28.851]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.051 --> 02:31:29.852]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.852 --> 02:31:32.614]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.614 --> 02:31:36.297]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.297 --> 02:31:37.078]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.078 --> 02:31:41.222]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.222 --> 02:31:45.986]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.286 --> 02:31:50.449]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.449 --> 02:31:52.230]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:54.492]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:32:00.376 --> 02:32:08.122]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[02:32:08.122 --> 02:32:12.465]  You can buy it at hereswhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks.
[02:32:12.805 --> 02:32:14.186]  Or the book for 10 bucks.
[02:32:14.186 --> 02:32:17.147]  And we have an audiobook on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:32:17.147 --> 02:32:23.429]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:32:23.429 --> 02:32:25.009]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:32:25.009 --> 02:32:27.490]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:32:27.490 --> 02:32:30.851]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy.
[02:32:30.851 --> 02:32:32.812]  And it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:32:33.112 --> 02:32:35.194]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:32:35.194 --> 02:32:36.956]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:32:36.956 --> 02:32:39.478]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:32:39.478 --> 02:32:44.203]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:32:44.203 --> 02:32:47.926]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:32:47.926 --> 02:32:51.049]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:51.049 --> 02:32:52.931]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:52.931 --> 02:32:55.053]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:33:06.032 --> 02:33:13.634]  We'll be taking your calls coming up here in a few minutes and discussing the new jobless recovery, the oxymoron.
[02:33:13.634 --> 02:33:16.534]  Bob Chapman though, start recapping your story.
[02:33:16.534 --> 02:33:25.056]  So you're talking to an owner of a large company that you know well and he's talking about trying to make large loans instead of going to a mega bank.
[02:33:25.056 --> 02:33:32.498]  He goes to a medium-sized Midwestern who they admit many of them are flush with cash from good investments and what happens next?
[02:33:34.246 --> 02:33:45.479]  He's told by the management that the reason why Ken Lay has quit his job as head of Bank of America is because... Ken Lay?
[02:33:45.479 --> 02:33:47.100]  You mean somebody else?
[02:33:47.100 --> 02:33:48.642]  Ken Lewis, excuse me.
[02:33:48.642 --> 02:33:49.043]  It's okay.
[02:33:49.043 --> 02:33:50.204]  Well, I mean, birds of a feather.
[02:33:50.204 --> 02:33:52.947]  It's hard to... Madoff, Madoff Lay.
[02:33:52.947 --> 02:33:53.628]  Go ahead.
[02:33:58.310 --> 02:34:01.933]  Anyway, it's not a laughing matter as a matter of fact.
[02:34:01.933 --> 02:34:13.624]  What they're doing is they're taking the toxic waste that the Fed is not buying directly and they're dumping it at the Bank of America and they're going to take it under this coming year.
[02:34:13.624 --> 02:34:17.788]  Now that's important inside information.
[02:34:17.788 --> 02:34:21.031]  And this quorum bank that just went under in Chicago
[02:34:22.697 --> 02:34:27.141]  M&B took them over and they refused to take any of the bad assets.
[02:34:27.141 --> 02:34:32.785]  The Fed had to take them in order to get Coram out of the way.
[02:34:32.785 --> 02:34:34.307]  And so is that a monetization?
[02:34:35.686 --> 02:34:37.108]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:34:54.187 --> 02:35:05.070]  When you say in the next year, you mean by the end of 2010, they're going to pile all the toxic assets, so he's getting out, kind of like Greenspan left, so he can blame it on Bernanke.
[02:35:05.070 --> 02:35:06.591]  You're saying that they're going to bring it down?
[02:35:06.591 --> 02:35:09.851]  What will that mean to the economy?
[02:35:09.851 --> 02:35:11.252]  It certainly won't help it.
[02:35:11.252 --> 02:35:22.195]  And the American taxpayer will end up paying the total bill for taking all of these toxic assets and dumping it to Bank of America and allowing Bank of America to go under.
[02:35:23.491 --> 02:35:30.476]  And it's going to be probably as much as a trillion dollars, if not more.
[02:35:30.476 --> 02:35:42.725]  Because, you know, the Fed right now is buying $1.2 trillion in toxic assets from banks and insurance companies and brokerage firms right now.
[02:35:42.725 --> 02:35:47.388]  And so, incidentally, the source told me also that
[02:35:48.568 --> 02:36:03.258]  There were 40 banks just in the Chicago area that are walking zombies and none of the other banks will take them over because they won't assume any of those toxic assets that they have.
[02:36:03.258 --> 02:36:10.862]  And so the Fed's going to have to end up taking them down and that's why my projection over the next four or five years of 3,200 to 4,200 of 8,400 banks will go under.
[02:36:10.862 --> 02:36:11.803]  The second story I've got
[02:36:19.085 --> 02:36:39.922]  And this I backed into is that how the Fed is financing the stock market and keeping it at the levels that they are is through a group of 21 primary traders who work with the Treasury and the Fed Reserve.
[02:36:39.922 --> 02:36:46.708]  And they're just pouring all the money that they could ever use into these entities, which in turn are
[02:36:48.343 --> 02:36:50.804]  Going into the market and buying.
[02:36:50.804 --> 02:36:59.527]  And they're doing the same thing with the same kind of entities in Europe to keep the stock market up over there so people won't think everything is terrible.
[02:36:59.527 --> 02:37:05.829]  And at the same time, they attack the commodity market in gold and silver.
[02:37:05.829 --> 02:37:11.671]  And one of the good things about gold and silver is I think they've almost run out of gold.
[02:37:11.671 --> 02:37:13.952]  And so they're going to have to use paper or derivatives
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:16.600]  In order to do what they're doing.
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:20.821]  But that's how the stock market is being financed.
[02:37:20.821 --> 02:37:35.365]  And if you want to read the inside of all the guts of the story, it's in this issue coming out tomorrow, The International Forecaster, which you can get free by just calling or using my email address.
[02:37:36.544 --> 02:37:39.086]  TheInternationalForecaster.com is the website.
[02:37:39.086 --> 02:37:42.088]  We link to a lot of your stories at InfoWars.com.
[02:37:42.088 --> 02:37:48.994]  Bob, in layman's terms, explain it to people, because the mainstream media
[02:37:50.367 --> 02:38:13.894]  Every day when I watch television, to monitor what they're up to, they say, this is something new, we know it doesn't make sense to you, but the economists at the government are experts, you're gonna have a jobless recovery, you're gonna lose your paycheck, or have it cut, or lose your job, but the big banks are doing well, and the Fortune 100 are doing good, and so that's the new gauge of the economy.
[02:38:13.894 --> 02:38:18.816]  You lose your job, or get your pay cut, or go to part-time, the working poor,
[02:38:19.956 --> 02:38:25.399]  And so a new booming economy is soup kitchen lines.
[02:38:25.399 --> 02:38:27.660]  Bob?
[02:38:27.660 --> 02:38:29.601]  Yeah, and it won't work, of course.
[02:38:29.601 --> 02:38:33.023]  And that's what I said on CBS this morning, and they went ballistic.
[02:38:33.023 --> 02:38:37.706]  But anyway, you can't throw money at a problem and make it work.
[02:38:37.706 --> 02:38:43.889]  I mean, anybody who has read any kind of history whatsoever realizes that, especially economic history.
[02:38:44.682 --> 02:38:51.285]  And so, all this money they're spending, in the final analysis, will end up in a deflationary depression.
[02:38:51.285 --> 02:38:54.246]  No matter what they do, they're just buying time.
[02:38:54.246 --> 02:39:00.008]  They started this, and the point of no return was in June of 2003.
[02:39:00.008 --> 02:39:01.568]  That's seven years ago.
[02:39:01.568 --> 02:39:02.969]  They can't go back.
[02:39:02.969 --> 02:39:08.851]  They want to go back, as per the Bilderberger meeting, they said, look, this thing's out of hand, what can we do?
[02:39:08.851 --> 02:39:12.253]  And they were told, you can't do anything, you're gonna have to ride it out.
[02:39:12.253 --> 02:39:13.233]  And that's where we're headed.
[02:39:13.823 --> 02:39:20.746]  We're on a horse headed for the front lines and the horse and you are being shot at.
[02:39:20.746 --> 02:39:36.914]  But the economy is going to continue to have the same kind of high unemployment we have now, 21.4% if you take U6 and strip out the birth-death ratio.
[02:39:40.248 --> 02:39:46.032]  It's going to increase slightly by the end of the year and increase slightly next year.
[02:39:46.032 --> 02:39:54.837]  And I also expect that we won't get the $2 trillion for Congress for the second stimulus package that I predicted in January.
[02:39:54.837 --> 02:40:00.580]  What I think we'll get, we'll get $400 to $800 billion and the banks are going to start lending again.
[02:40:00.580 --> 02:40:03.102]  And that is immediate monetization.
[02:40:03.683 --> 02:40:03.803]  Bob,
[02:40:30.458 --> 02:40:36.481]  The calls we have on hold, Sean, Jeff, Hannibal, Terry, Todd, and others are going to be all over the map, but I know you can comment on any of it.
[02:40:36.481 --> 02:40:40.803]  I've been fighting the globalists for close to 50 years.
[02:40:40.803 --> 02:40:43.544]  But I have a few other economic questions I want to get into.
[02:40:44.938 --> 02:40:57.002]  And I also wanted to ask you first, did you see the editorial written that was published in hundreds of world newspapers, including the New York Times, by Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General of the Puppet General Assembly?
[02:40:57.002 --> 02:40:59.883]  Obama's the real head of the UN, the head of the Security Council.
[02:40:59.883 --> 02:41:09.067]  And that treason right there, in fact I want your comment on that, that was just in a few newspapers and on CNN, but saying he's now President of the World, ha ha ha.
[02:41:10.180 --> 02:41:10.461]  I don't
[02:41:20.643 --> 02:41:22.243]  Thousands of articles per week.
[02:41:22.243 --> 02:41:39.608]  You can go to Google News, type in world government, new world order, global governance, and there are thousands per week on each term saying world government's good, saying they're going to tax all our carbon in our homes, saying that it's to reduce population.
[02:41:39.608 --> 02:41:45.329]  I mean, they say world government, they all give speeches saying it, and
[02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:51.781]  Uh, Gordon Brown is in the news saying we want a world socialist government.
[02:41:53.513 --> 02:42:03.839]  But then meanwhile, other publications write articles, especially about myself, more than anybody else, saying I'm a lying, insane person, there's no world government, no carbon tax.
[02:42:03.839 --> 02:42:10.703]  I mean, what is the strategy here, where they admit they're doing it all, but say it's good, but then say none of it exists?
[02:42:10.703 --> 02:42:19.388]  I mean, are they just trying to condition people to get used to insane lying, or just a fog of frazzled propaganda?
[02:42:19.388 --> 02:42:21.489]  I mean, this is getting insane.
[02:42:23.083 --> 02:42:35.266]  Well, I think it's propaganda, and as I pointed out a couple of days ago on Beck's program on China, 95% truth, 5% misdirection and propaganda.
[02:42:35.266 --> 02:42:40.327]  And it's so typical of what you pick up with the mainline media.
[02:42:40.327 --> 02:42:42.027]  And you're not going to get the truth.
[02:42:42.027 --> 02:42:46.188]  You're going to get the truth with Alex Jones and a handful of other people on the radio.
[02:42:47.126 --> 02:42:49.970]  And a few publications and that's about it.
[02:42:49.970 --> 02:42:55.637]  Although I will say, and I say this every week, we are gaining on them.
[02:42:55.637 --> 02:42:58.361]  We have them running.
[02:42:58.361 --> 02:42:59.703]  And they've made a lot of mistakes.
[02:43:00.865 --> 02:43:12.031]  Things aren't working out the way that they'd want them to, and that's why you see the oath offensive that's going on for the acceptance of the idea of world government, which you just cited.
[02:43:12.031 --> 02:43:22.836]  And they're going to continue to do that because they want to wrap this thing up as quickly as they can and not have the economy collapse on them in the process.
[02:43:22.836 --> 02:43:26.198]  They will collapse the economy when they want to.
[02:43:26.198 --> 02:43:28.739]  Well, it's clear they're already the final takeover.
[02:43:29.318 --> 02:43:49.467]  It's clear they're collapsing Main Street and the industrial economy, and that was what Naftan Gant and the Globalist owned documents state that that's their plan to destroy industrial capacity to bring in total centralization and total dependency of the population on the elite that control the planet with their fiat currency, buying the world through their Ponzi scheme.
[02:43:49.467 --> 02:43:51.728]  I mean, these are con artists that took over the world.
[02:43:51.728 --> 02:43:53.308]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[02:43:55.387 --> 02:43:57.168]  I understand why they're doing it.
[02:43:57.168 --> 02:44:07.195]  They sit there and say world government's good, but then they paint you and tar you with a brush that you're bad and a kook if you say you don't like it by saying it doesn't exist.
[02:44:07.195 --> 02:44:08.716]  I just see this backfiring.
[02:44:08.716 --> 02:44:10.857]  I don't just see it in the future backfiring.
[02:44:10.857 --> 02:44:22.865]  It's backfiring now because the public isn't as dumb as they think, going, wait, you're saying world government's good and world tax is good and that it's being done to destroy industrial society for the betterment of the earth.
[02:44:22.865 --> 02:44:25.147]  But then on the other hand, you're saying none of this exists.
[02:44:25.887 --> 02:44:27.228]  Bob Shatman?
[02:44:27.228 --> 02:44:29.970]  Can't have it both ways, and you're right.
[02:44:29.970 --> 02:44:38.935]  You know, even people who are not educated beyond high school, they even spot this.
[02:44:38.935 --> 02:44:51.822]  How could we have 75% of the public for auditing, investigating in the Fed, when that's a very, very complex position to take for the average person who hasn't
[02:44:53.189 --> 02:44:56.030]  Then more educated, we'll put it that way.
[02:44:56.030 --> 02:45:05.052]  So the public is catching on, they know something's wrong, they're reaching out, and they want to know the truth, and you're giving it to them.
[02:45:05.052 --> 02:45:08.332]  And I'm trying to give it to my publication.
[02:45:08.332 --> 02:45:11.993]  And this is extraordinarily important.
[02:45:11.993 --> 02:45:14.293]  They can't handle it.
[02:45:14.293 --> 02:45:21.595]  And they're going off in all different directions, and they're trying to strike back by having world government
[02:45:22.532 --> 02:45:34.521]  In the minds of the people, and of course as a dichotomous situation like you point out, they say one thing in one hand and one thing in the other, they think people are not watching both sides of the equation.
[02:45:34.521 --> 02:45:38.824]  Well there's another mind game, and then we're going to calls, but I want you to comment on this.
[02:45:38.824 --> 02:45:51.053]  They have a lot of different little think tanks and front groups and organizations, like Snopes, that it will tell you what's an urban legend and what isn't, and I found it's pure propaganda, usually disinformation or outright lies.
[02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:57.012]  Wikipedia is a pure organ of the CIA, that's been admitted.
[02:45:57.012 --> 02:46:21.365]  All of this is going on, but I also see a lot of their groups now, and the Fed's hired the big Enron lobbyist and others, and I saw Bernanke this week on C-SPAN in the break room live admitting they're intensifying their, quote, education program in schools, teaching people how great the Federal Reserve is, countering lies about the Fed, and they're putting out this spin that, no, the Fed is an agency of government,
[02:46:22.279 --> 02:46:26.061]  It's just independent and the President and the Congress have no say so.
[02:46:26.061 --> 02:46:28.082]  And I have Greenspan on video.
[02:46:28.082 --> 02:46:30.203]  I have Bernanke in testimony saying that.
[02:46:30.203 --> 02:46:32.524]  For people that are in denial, it's on video.
[02:46:32.524 --> 02:46:35.106]  Just Google Greenspan says Fed above the law.
[02:46:35.106 --> 02:46:39.448]  But in a way they're telling the truth in their very delicate lawyer speak.
[02:46:39.448 --> 02:46:41.329]  They are an agency of government.
[02:46:41.329 --> 02:46:51.114]  They are a separate corporate mercenary group that in 1913 did a deal with Congress to hijack control over the monetary policy
[02:46:52.034 --> 02:46:55.776]  And it is just a private front group or holding company.
[02:46:55.776 --> 02:46:57.477]  That's all admitted by them.
[02:46:57.477 --> 02:47:05.342]  But then they have their operatives go, no, it's just an independent agency of government because the president appoints the chairman, but not the rest of the board.
[02:47:05.342 --> 02:47:11.266]  So briefly, as we go to break and then come back with calls, I want to keep you over to the next hour, Bob, if you can do it, so we can take more calls.
[02:47:12.273 --> 02:47:39.015]  Just because you're a top stockbroker, researcher, goldbroker, highly respected, and I've had Congressman Ron Paul on to explain it, and I've had other economists on, but in layman's terms, the Fed is a private consortium for private banks, but it does have government power through an act of Congress, just like in England, they're giving the Bank of England, and even local towns now, and private corporations, the power to seize your bank account or home without warrants.
[02:47:39.015 --> 02:47:40.536]  So it's a letter of mark.
[02:47:40.536 --> 02:47:41.457]  The federal government
[02:47:41.977 --> 02:47:42.297]  Absolutely.
[02:47:42.297 --> 02:47:44.119]  That's the perfect way to put it.
[02:47:44.119 --> 02:47:45.640]  And it's going to end up going beyond that.
[02:48:06.527 --> 02:48:16.991]  The Confederates are a private organization geared to do the monetary policy of the United States by an act of Congress.
[02:48:16.991 --> 02:48:23.733]  And that is going to continue unless we stop it, you know, through the Senate and the House.
[02:48:23.733 --> 02:48:29.395]  Their ability is to create money out of nothing.
[02:48:29.395 --> 02:48:33.637]  And there's no responsibility for it, as we're seeing now as we go forward.
[02:48:34.518 --> 02:48:45.927]  With all of these problems that we have with them creating so much money into the TARP program and sending it out through all the banking systems throughout the world.
[02:48:45.927 --> 02:48:49.851]  Hey Bob, do you have somebody putting a new roof on your house?
[02:48:49.851 --> 02:48:53.033]  No, it's next door and there's not much I can do to control it.
[02:48:53.033 --> 02:48:53.574]  I'm sorry.
[02:48:53.574 --> 02:48:56.856]  No, no, that's alright.
[02:48:56.856 --> 02:48:59.418]  Are you on a headset too?
[02:48:59.418 --> 02:48:59.939]  No, I'm not.
[02:49:01.064 --> 02:49:07.707]  Okay, it just sounds like you've got a turkey leg in your mouth half the time.
[02:49:07.707 --> 02:49:12.930]  But as soon as we get a break, I'm going to see if I can get them to stop for 15 minutes.
[02:49:12.930 --> 02:49:14.230]  Hey, listen, I know you're busy.
[02:49:14.230 --> 02:49:15.171]  I won't ask you during the break.
[02:49:15.171 --> 02:49:16.351]  I'll ask you live.
[02:49:16.351 --> 02:49:18.312]  Last week you had to go right at the end of the hour.
[02:49:18.312 --> 02:49:20.733]  Can you stay 20 minutes with us into the next hour?
[02:49:20.733 --> 02:49:24.515]  Absolutely, and I'm going to see if I can bribe these guys to stop for a minute.
[02:49:25.669 --> 02:49:27.450]  All right, we'll run outside and take care of that.
[02:49:27.450 --> 02:49:30.171]  We'll be back in a few minutes with Bob Chapman and go to your phone calls.
[02:49:30.171 --> 02:49:33.473]  Sean, Jeff, Hannibal, Terry, Todd, Keebler, and others.
[02:49:33.473 --> 02:49:38.395]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:49:38.395 --> 02:49:41.196]  I did want to throw out the calls.
[02:49:41.196 --> 02:49:43.618]  We got a break one more time today at least.
[02:49:43.618 --> 02:49:45.919]  Ladies and gentlemen, Fall of the Republic is out.
[02:49:47.269 --> 02:50:01.142]  A two-hour, 24-minute film explains who the bankers are, how they criminally took over, how they engineered the collapse, how they're going to bring us into an even bigger collapse with their own statements, the police state they're setting up, how they've mesmerized and brainwashed the public.
[02:50:01.142 --> 02:50:09.890]  This is my greatest film, and it's on DVD in the highest quality with the 30 minutes of extras, an Oathkeeper section, and Charlie Sheen's message to the President.
[02:50:10.650 --> 02:50:12.331]  All on one DVD.
[02:50:12.331 --> 02:50:13.952]  DVD 9 plays on all players.
[02:50:13.952 --> 02:50:15.233]  There's a zero country code.
[02:50:15.233 --> 02:50:16.734]  Plays everywhere in the world.

[02:50:22.998 --> 02:50:31.024]  And instead of running around fighting crowds and traffic and buying people fruitcakes and ties, why not give the gift of truth?
[02:50:31.024 --> 02:50:34.846]  A high quality, beautifully packaged DVD.
[02:50:34.846 --> 02:50:37.708]  I think I have a Fall of the Republic around here somewhere.
[02:50:37.708 --> 02:50:38.389]  Here's an endgame.
[02:50:39.693 --> 02:50:53.122]  You can go to InfoWars.com, order it, put the address in where you want it sent, type in a note there that you want sent to the person so they know what they're getting, and they will get this in their mail, and you can unlock a mind and support our broadcast.

[02:50:54.082 --> 02:50:54.843]  Operators are standing by.

[02:51:01.067 --> 02:51:08.069]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:51:08.069 --> 02:51:10.150]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:51:10.150 --> 02:51:12.391]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:51:12.391 --> 02:51:14.031]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:51:14.031 --> 02:51:18.513]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:51:18.513 --> 02:51:21.094]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[02:51:27.756 --> 02:51:28.216]  We're good to go!
[02:51:54.278 --> 02:52:00.193]  Or visit a Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:52:01.795 --> 02:52:06.117]  Food security from eFoodsDirect, the most valuable protection your family can have.
[02:52:06.117 --> 02:52:07.618]  It's a scary world we live in.
[02:52:07.618 --> 02:52:11.981]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[02:52:11.981 --> 02:52:15.663]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[02:52:15.663 --> 02:52:23.467]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[02:52:23.467 --> 02:52:27.430]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[02:52:27.430 --> 02:52:29.811]  And the solution for every one of these threats to your family
[02:52:30.051 --> 02:52:30.431]  We're good.
[02:52:43.148 --> 02:52:46.129]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:46.129 --> 02:52:47.889]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:47.889 --> 02:52:49.330]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[02:53:11.405 --> 02:53:14.108]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:53:14.108 --> 02:53:20.494]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:53:20.494 --> 02:53:25.679]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:53:25.679 --> 02:53:35.668]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:53:35.768 --> 02:53:38.110]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:53:38.110 --> 02:53:39.711]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:53:39.711 --> 02:53:42.172]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:53:42.172 --> 02:53:44.294]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:53:44.294 --> 02:53:49.457]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:53:49.457 --> 02:53:54.460]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:53:54.460 --> 02:53:58.563]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:11.609 --> 02:54:25.663]  I told you we've gotten news reports from Kentucky, New York, Texas, California in the last couple months, even with the seasonal flu shot, where they inject especially elementary school students because they know they're little.
[02:54:25.663 --> 02:54:30.248]  And the parents go down to the school and get real mad and they say, we didn't give your child a shot.
[02:54:30.248 --> 02:54:31.529]  And then they see the needle hole.
[02:54:34.165 --> 02:54:36.426]  And then other children go, no, they gave us shots too.
[02:54:36.426 --> 02:54:39.328]  They lined us up in the cafeteria.
[02:54:39.328 --> 02:54:45.110]  Folks, the government gave black men syphilis and let them spread it and die of it over 45 years with Tuskegee.
[02:54:45.110 --> 02:54:50.113]  They radiated foster children to death in radiation experiments, 4,300 plus.
[02:54:50.113 --> 02:54:52.714]  They're doing this stuff all the time.
[02:54:52.714 --> 02:54:54.475]  Here's New York Daily News today.
[02:54:54.475 --> 02:54:57.376]  I mean, I'm seeing these every day now.
[02:54:57.376 --> 02:55:00.618]  Public school nurse gives swine flu vaccine to kids without parents.
[02:55:02.518 --> 02:55:04.321]  Sends child to hospital.
[02:55:04.321 --> 02:55:10.008]  That's just like the Taylor School gets caught doing this.
[02:55:10.008 --> 02:55:16.817]  They caught one of my employees had their daughter, elementary school, strip searched because she had a bruise on her knees.
[02:55:16.817 --> 02:55:19.361]  Then they lied about it and got caught down in Kyle.
[02:55:20.916 --> 02:55:21.816]  They just lie!
[02:55:21.816 --> 02:55:22.937]  These people are liars!
[02:55:22.937 --> 02:55:28.739]  Look, public school nurses give swine flu vaccine to kids without parents okay since child of the hospital.
[02:55:28.739 --> 02:55:33.841]  We only know about this because the child went to the hospital and had convulsions.
[02:55:35.057 --> 02:55:40.641]  See, it's meant to brain damage you, but when it has a really bad effect on some people, and so knocks them out right there.
[02:55:40.641 --> 02:55:45.524]  So you only know about it when they get sick, and that's what's happening with these cases.
[02:55:45.524 --> 02:55:49.086]  Here it is, New York Daily News, and it says it sent him to the hospital.
[02:55:49.086 --> 02:55:52.328]  I want Naomi Troy, his mother,
[02:55:55.523 --> 02:55:58.085]  Her mother, the six-year-old daughter.
[02:55:58.085 --> 02:55:59.706]  See, it's always little kids.
[02:55:59.706 --> 02:56:04.489]  They don't do this with the high schoolers, because they can speak for themselves and go, you did too, give me a shot.
[02:56:04.489 --> 02:56:06.590]  No, we didn't!
[02:56:06.590 --> 02:56:08.532]  You're a liar!
[02:56:08.532 --> 02:56:12.875]  And I have all these newscasts I can play, that we'll play some later if we take calls.
[02:56:12.875 --> 02:56:15.136]  Bob Chapman, I just wanted to bring this up.
[02:56:15.136 --> 02:56:17.178]  I mean, how is this not the Soviet Union?
[02:56:17.178 --> 02:56:23.562]  But if they're gonna put fluoride and all these other chemicals in our water and force Medicaid, why not shoot our kids up and lie about it, Bob?
[02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:38.308]  Well, I've been doing that with the other inoculations previously, which you've discussed many times regarding autism, and we'll call it semi-autism, being that I'm not a doctor and I don't know what the terms are.
[02:56:38.308 --> 02:56:48.754]  But, you know, I see so much evidence of it, and, you know, 15 years ago such things didn't exist among children, virtually.
[02:56:48.754 --> 02:56:51.356]  And so, yes, they're doing it, and it's
[02:56:52.797 --> 02:56:56.758]  Like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, there's no question.
[02:56:56.758 --> 02:57:05.819]  I put it more akin to Nazi Germany because of the marriage of corporate America and the government, which is fascism.
[02:57:05.819 --> 02:57:09.000]  I think it better... And they're all just different flavors of command and control.
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.600]  But look, here's the New York Daily News.
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:13.361]  I saw this last night.
[02:57:13.361 --> 02:57:19.562]  I've become so conditioned that I didn't even cover it today until one of the guys said, aren't you going to cover this and handed it to me again.
[02:57:20.603 --> 02:57:22.084]  A whole bunch of paragraphs down.
[02:57:22.084 --> 02:57:28.567]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[02:57:28.567 --> 02:57:30.308]  15 paragraphs down.
[02:57:30.308 --> 02:57:32.790]  There's a minor footnote.
[02:57:32.790 --> 02:57:40.514]  Oh, a student at PS65 in Staten Island also received the vaccine without parental permission on Wednesday.
[02:57:40.514 --> 02:57:40.874]  So see?
[02:57:42.578 --> 02:57:49.460]  But the bigger issue is, Bob, parents are calling me every day when we open phones up from parents about this.
[02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:53.701]  They're doing this everywhere, and the schools are lying about it.
[02:57:53.701 --> 02:57:55.282]  I mean, how criminal are they?
[02:57:55.282 --> 02:58:00.183]  How systemic is criminal lying by government now?
[02:58:00.183 --> 02:58:02.084]  It is unbelievable.
[02:58:02.084 --> 02:58:10.366]  It is something that somebody my age can't even put into a mental or emotional context.
[02:58:11.337 --> 02:58:15.361]  I mean, these kind of things never went on before.
[02:58:15.361 --> 02:58:21.346]  The process is really the last 5 to 10, 15 years.
[02:58:21.346 --> 02:58:30.535]  Well, they do it with Native Americans or foster kids they've got in the 50s and they take them in and radiate them to death when nobody can save them in their white lab coats, but now it's just everybody.
[02:58:30.535 --> 02:58:35.339]  A little control freak, you know, I don't care if the parents don't want it, I'm gonna do it.
[02:58:35.339 --> 02:58:37.101]  There's your cancer virus and mercury.
[02:58:40.780 --> 02:58:42.783]  Yeah!
[02:58:42.783 --> 02:58:46.047]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.047 --> 02:58:48.270]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.225 --> 02:58:56.246]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.246 --> 02:58:59.487]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.487 --> 02:59:04.268]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.268 --> 02:59:10.669]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.669 --> 02:59:12.910]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.450 --> 02:59:13.750]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:13.750 --> 02:59:14.270]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.270 --> 02:59:14.930]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:14.930 --> 02:59:16.051]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.051 --> 02:59:18.471]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.355 --> 02:59:34.476]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.476 --> 02:59:39.640]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:59:39.640 --> 02:59:54.029]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:54.029 --> 02:59:56.411]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.411 --> 02:59:59.173]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:12.952]  All right, for the next 20 minutes with Bob Chapman, we're going to be taking your phone calls.
[03:00:12.952 --> 03:00:14.073]  Thanks for being patient.
[03:00:14.073 --> 03:00:23.641]  Then in studio, another adventure of Aaron Dykes and Rob Dube, traveling to Canada and around the United States doing three interviews.
[03:00:25.151 --> 03:00:26.473]  We're following the Republic too.
[03:00:26.473 --> 03:00:28.656]  Oh yeah, we don't rest around here.
[03:00:28.656 --> 03:00:31.519]  You understand we're in a war against the globalists.
[03:00:31.519 --> 03:00:33.262]  A life and death struggle.
[03:00:33.262 --> 03:00:35.124]  And it was just hellish.
[03:00:35.124 --> 03:00:36.746]  Just wait until you hear the border stories.
[03:00:36.746 --> 03:00:38.368]  Detroit collapsing.
[03:00:38.368 --> 03:00:40.171]  Trying to force them into body scanners.
[03:00:40.171 --> 03:00:41.893]  Trying to manhandle them when they said no.
[03:00:43.126 --> 03:00:47.149]  I mean, this country is Nazi Germany, and it's getting worse and worse.
[03:00:47.149 --> 03:00:51.231]  We're about 1937 under Hitler right now, and it's about to get a lot worse.
[03:00:51.231 --> 03:00:54.273]  Bob Chapman's our guest at TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[03:00:54.273 --> 03:00:54.913]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:54.913 --> 03:00:56.835]  Our website's InfoWars.com.
[03:00:56.835 --> 03:00:58.035]  Sean in New York.
[03:00:58.035 --> 03:00:59.116]  Thanks for holding it on the air.
[03:00:59.116 --> 03:01:00.397]  Go ahead.
[03:01:00.397 --> 03:01:00.777]  Hi, Alex.
[03:01:00.777 --> 03:01:01.497]  How are you?
[03:01:01.497 --> 03:01:03.138]  Good.
[03:01:03.138 --> 03:01:10.383]  I'm an attorney working in New York City, and I thought you would find it interesting how law schools deal with the issue of the Federal Reserve.
[03:01:11.021 --> 03:01:15.043]  Basically, they do not discuss it in any capacity at all.
[03:01:15.043 --> 03:01:18.926]  And if it's brought up, it's ridiculed, it's, you know, simply pushed under the rug.
[03:01:18.926 --> 03:01:25.289]  Oh yeah, even talking about the Federal Reserve, ten years ago, people would act like it didn't exist.
[03:01:25.289 --> 03:01:32.353]  Well, I had a serious argument with a friend of mine who is in law review at NYU.
[03:01:32.353 --> 03:01:36.896]  He works for the SEC, and I told him that the Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[03:01:37.355 --> 03:01:41.678]  And he said, oh, that's absolute nonsense, that's a conspiracy, etc., etc.
[03:01:41.678 --> 03:01:50.666]  So I pointed him to the Federal Reserve Act, Section 16, which says, the said Federal Reserve notes shall be obligations of the United States.
[03:01:50.666 --> 03:01:56.350]  Basically meaning that every dollar in circulation is owed to the private bank.
[03:01:56.350 --> 03:02:00.974]  And I don't, I mean, he still, when I showed him the words of the statute,
[03:02:01.494 --> 03:02:02.615]  Still wouldn't accept it as true.
[03:02:02.615 --> 03:02:05.278]  That's because he thinks he's a member of the establishment.
[03:02:05.278 --> 03:02:19.394]  You guys, there are so many people making a hundred grand a year that think they're God because they get invited to a regional banquet with a thousand local minions and they just they're all into sitting near power and oh they're powerful and
[03:02:19.574 --> 03:02:23.176]  There's no fluoride in their water and there's no stuff in their kids' shots.
[03:02:23.176 --> 03:02:26.017]  What do you call... But Alex, it goes even deeper than that.
[03:02:26.017 --> 03:02:32.821]  If you try to research the Federal Reserve on LexisNexis or Westlaw as a law student, you are denied access.
[03:02:33.365 --> 03:02:36.066]  You do not have access to the cases or the statutes.
[03:02:36.066 --> 03:02:41.447]  You can pull up law review articles on those databases, but those are very limited in scope.
[03:02:41.447 --> 03:02:43.067]  Basically, and there's no classes.
[03:02:43.067 --> 03:02:44.467]  There's no classes on economic policy.
[03:02:44.467 --> 03:02:45.948]  Well, listen, you should do an article.
[03:02:45.948 --> 03:02:47.648]  I was familiar with some of that.
[03:02:47.648 --> 03:02:48.768]  It's never been audited.
[03:02:48.768 --> 03:02:52.309]  You should do an article and send it to writersandinfowars.com.
[03:02:52.309 --> 03:02:55.689]  You can use a pen name if you want.
[03:02:55.689 --> 03:03:01.651]  I would love you to write a two, three page simple article and point out that as a law student you're unable to do that.
[03:03:01.651 --> 03:03:03.051]  Bob, this is a big issue, isn't it?
[03:03:04.039 --> 03:03:12.225]  It certainly is, because there's a deliberate attempt, as the gentleman is saying, to keep the information away from everybody.
[03:03:12.225 --> 03:03:18.969]  The scam is at the core of what these elitists are doing, not only to the United States, but to the world.
[03:03:18.969 --> 03:03:21.451]  The Bank of England represents the same thing.
[03:03:21.451 --> 03:03:23.132]  It is also a private corporation.
[03:03:23.132 --> 03:03:24.913]  Well, it's partners with the Fed.
[03:03:24.913 --> 03:03:26.374]  I mean, that goes back to 1913.
[03:03:29.423 --> 03:03:34.567]  Well, the Bank of England, I think, is somewhere around 1680 or something like that.
[03:03:34.567 --> 03:03:38.630]  No, but I'm saying the Bank of England is in partnership with the Federal Reserve.
[03:03:38.630 --> 03:03:40.011]  Absolutely.
[03:03:40.011 --> 03:03:40.751]  Absolutely.
[03:03:40.751 --> 03:03:46.015]  Every move that they make is coordinated together and has been since its inception.
[03:03:46.015 --> 03:03:55.582]  And one of the reasons why is many of the original shareholders, who are still shareholders in the Federal Reserve from the 12 regional banks, are Europeans.
[03:03:56.260 --> 03:03:57.100]  That's right.
[03:03:57.100 --> 03:03:58.401]  It's a state secret, Alex.
[03:03:58.401 --> 03:03:58.821]  We can't know.
[03:04:15.106 --> 03:04:28.516]  And I'm so happy the young man called in and said what he had to say about the accessibility of information on the Fed to law students and people within the law profession.
[03:04:28.516 --> 03:04:34.441]  And of course, his comments regarding the SEC were not unexpected.
[03:04:34.441 --> 03:04:38.244]  All they do is chase the little guys and let the big guys get away with murder.
[03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:40.180]  That's the way it is.
[03:04:40.180 --> 03:04:44.843]  They've gotten rid of most of the investigators with the FBI and Secret Service on financial crimes.
[03:04:44.843 --> 03:04:47.945]  But they put all the people they have on little bitty blue collar.
[03:04:47.945 --> 03:04:49.006]  Thank you, Sean.
[03:04:49.006 --> 03:04:49.846]  Do a report.
[03:04:49.846 --> 03:04:50.627]  We need writers.
[03:04:50.627 --> 03:04:53.108]  We need people that understand this to expose it.
[03:04:53.108 --> 03:04:56.430]  Just make sure you have your links and proofs so we can approve it and post it.
[03:04:56.430 --> 03:04:59.252]  Alright, Jeff, Hannibal, Terry, Todd, and many others.
[03:04:59.252 --> 03:05:00.753]  Your call is straight ahead for Bob Chapman.
[03:05:00.973 --> 03:05:10.117]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:05:10.117 --> 03:05:13.498]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:05:13.498 --> 03:05:19.361]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[03:05:19.361 --> 03:05:24.143]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:05:24.143 --> 03:05:26.484]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:05:26.764 --> 03:05:35.951]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[03:05:35.951 --> 03:05:41.515]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[03:05:41.515 --> 03:05:43.436]  Help others and earn extra income.

[03:06:01.598 --> 03:06:04.619]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.619 --> 03:06:09.942]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.942 --> 03:06:11.983]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.983 --> 03:06:16.985]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.985 --> 03:06:18.166]  How much do you want?
[03:06:18.166 --> 03:06:19.306]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.306 --> 03:06:21.187]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.187 --> 03:06:22.248]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.248 --> 03:06:24.449]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.449 --> 03:06:25.809]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.809 --> 03:06:27.110]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.310 --> 03:06:32.576]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.576 --> 03:06:36.181]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:36.181 --> 03:06:39.985]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.985 --> 03:06:41.226]  How much will you need?
[03:06:41.226 --> 03:06:42.128]  We don't know.
[03:06:42.128 --> 03:06:43.229]  How much do you want?
[03:06:43.229 --> 03:06:44.170]  All you can get.
[03:06:44.170 --> 03:06:44.971]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.231 --> 03:06:48.296]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:08:23.439 --> 03:08:26.700]  Big news blitz coming up at the 24 After segment.
[03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:32.163]  And we've got two of my crew members in studio for the police state escapades they witnessed.
[03:08:32.163 --> 03:08:34.405]  We're taking calls right now with Bob Chapman.
[03:08:34.405 --> 03:08:35.966]  Jeff in Canada, thanks for holding.
[03:08:35.966 --> 03:08:36.546]  You're on the air.
[03:08:37.372 --> 03:08:38.812]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[03:08:38.812 --> 03:08:42.073]  I have a story about swine flu I wanted to pass on and get your thoughts.
[03:08:42.073 --> 03:08:49.636]  A good friend of mine, last week his wife found out she was seven weeks pregnant and she was in the doctor's office.
[03:08:49.636 --> 03:08:53.297]  He was in the waiting room with his two-year-old daughter.
[03:08:53.297 --> 03:09:02.900]  He didn't know what was going on inside and the doctor strongly advised his wife that for her protection she should get the swine flu shot and
[03:09:04.104 --> 03:09:17.647]  She's pretty unaware as far as, you know, she hasn't... She didn't know what to do, so she took it, and within 24 hours, she was spotted and she lost the baby.
[03:09:18.800 --> 03:09:21.761]  I just wondered if you had heard any other stories like this?
[03:09:21.761 --> 03:09:22.501]  Absolutely.
[03:09:22.501 --> 03:09:30.764]  The United Nations has been caught in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, Latin America, and with Native Americans in the U.S.
[03:09:30.764 --> 03:09:33.025]  This is mainstream news.
[03:09:33.025 --> 03:09:37.146]  You can just Google, UN caught sterilizing women through tetanus shot.
[03:09:37.146 --> 03:09:40.147]  You'll get mainstream articles out of India and Africa and Latin America.
[03:09:40.147 --> 03:09:42.468]  And the doctor doesn't know this.
[03:09:42.468 --> 03:09:47.890]  And the autoimmune response, normally before they said don't give flu shots to women, now they say it's for women.
[03:09:48.790 --> 03:09:53.892]  And it routinely, especially early in pregnancies, kills babies.
[03:09:53.892 --> 03:09:55.872]  And he needs to sue that doctor.
[03:09:55.872 --> 03:09:57.653]  They need to sue him.
[03:09:57.653 --> 03:09:59.813]  It's in the FDA literature.
[03:09:59.813 --> 03:10:02.634]  And because the doctors are like cult members, many of them.
[03:10:02.634 --> 03:10:03.615]  Now, a lot of them are awake.
[03:10:03.615 --> 03:10:04.655]  We have medical doctors on.
[03:10:04.655 --> 03:10:07.956]  We've had scores of them on the last six months about this.
[03:10:07.956 --> 03:10:14.258]  But those are normally specialists who have multiple degrees and know about this, and know about autoimmune responses and toxicology.
[03:10:15.402 --> 03:10:17.905]  Uh, but this is just incredible.
[03:10:17.905 --> 03:10:21.789]  Uh, do they know that the vaccine is the number one suspect?
[03:10:21.789 --> 03:10:25.574]  Well, I mean, within 24 hours, how can it not be?
[03:10:25.574 --> 03:10:30.058]  And also, I mean, I don't really... Sure helped the baby, didn't it?
[03:10:30.058 --> 03:10:31.140]  Sure helped the baby, didn't it?
[03:10:31.140 --> 03:10:32.681]  I'm sorry, what?
[03:10:32.681 --> 03:10:34.203]  It sure helped the baby.
[03:10:34.203 --> 03:10:35.404]  Baby's dead now.
[03:10:35.404 --> 03:10:36.225]  Yeah, it's dead.
[03:10:36.225 --> 03:10:36.666]  And, uh...
[03:10:37.815 --> 03:10:44.259]  I thought it was pretty common knowledge not to give any type of vaccination in the first trimester.
[03:10:44.259 --> 03:10:48.661]  Yeah, that was always the contraindication, was to not give it to pregnant women.
[03:10:48.661 --> 03:10:50.743]  But these sickos are testing
[03:10:51.724 --> 03:10:58.730]  Look, they had to suspend the swine flu shot in 76 because it killed so many people, and that was later admitted by the FDA and the government.
[03:10:58.730 --> 03:11:08.960]  Now they just put out press releases saying it's impossible, there are no side effects, it's a conspiracy theory, a fake sheet they give you, meanwhile the insert says it all if they just...
[03:11:10.161 --> 03:11:14.604]  This is so sickening to hear, and that's why I want to reach more people.
[03:11:14.604 --> 03:11:22.769]  It's why I want listeners to email their email list and tell them anybody can listen to us on the web at InfoWars.com, even if an AM and FM isn't in your area.
[03:11:22.769 --> 03:11:33.816]  And I just, I know, look, EcoScience and all these other books written by the top scientists say our water, our vaccines, they're sterilizing us with them.
[03:11:34.892 --> 03:11:41.897]  I mean, it says in the drug inserts, I've been showing every day here, I'll dig it out, that it can sterilize you or make you lose a baby.
[03:11:41.897 --> 03:11:43.518]  They know this!
[03:11:43.518 --> 03:11:46.821]  And it's so diabolical, people can't believe it.
[03:11:46.821 --> 03:11:50.343]  They write books about how they're doing it to us.
[03:11:50.343 --> 03:11:54.226]  I'm sorry to hear that, Jeff, and they can maybe have another baby.
[03:11:54.226 --> 03:11:59.390]  It also tends to really destroy the fertility of women.
[03:11:59.390 --> 03:12:02.112]  Here's what they were caught with the tetanus shot alone, where the U.N.
[03:12:02.112 --> 03:12:02.613]  in 1996 was caught.
[03:12:05.646 --> 03:12:12.633]  And they tried to spin it and say, oh, the manufacturer must have added this very expensive female hormone that's only released during pregnancy.
[03:12:12.633 --> 03:12:21.041]  The body then recognizes it along with the tetanus as a pathogen and creates an autoimmune response in the sexual organs.
[03:12:21.041 --> 03:12:25.044]  It a lot of times kills the woman or she has serious complications from it.
[03:12:25.044 --> 03:12:26.306]  And people said, well, why did the U.N.
[03:12:26.306 --> 03:12:29.208]  have all these different manufacturers that accidentally added the hormone?
[03:12:30.029 --> 03:12:32.512]  They have been caught over and over again.
[03:12:32.512 --> 03:12:36.056]  That's why I'm not really worried about them killing me or imprisoning me or torturing me.
[03:12:36.056 --> 03:12:41.842]  I mean, I don't want that to happen, but how can I know this?
[03:12:41.842 --> 03:12:46.688]  And, I mean, take a cop who wants to billy club me because I'm videotaping in public.
[03:12:47.620 --> 03:12:49.981]  Even as they billy club me, I feel sorry for him.
[03:12:49.981 --> 03:12:52.862]  He's going to brain damage his kid, himself, his wife.
[03:12:52.862 --> 03:12:54.603]  He doesn't know he's being murdered.
[03:12:54.603 --> 03:12:56.123]  He can't imagine it.
[03:12:56.123 --> 03:12:56.623]  He can't.
[03:12:56.623 --> 03:12:58.704]  He's too weak-minded to accept it.
[03:12:58.704 --> 03:13:04.526]  I'm strong enough to face what the elites tell me they're doing, and I'm going to stand up and fight them.
[03:13:04.526 --> 03:13:12.509]  And once you step into that mode as a warrior to defend the weak, the question is, how could you not speak out against these killers?
[03:13:12.509 --> 03:13:14.550]  Bob Chapman, that's a pretty hard story to hear, isn't it?
[03:13:15.638 --> 03:13:24.347]  It certainly is, and it's going on all over the world for a long time, and as long as we don't say anything, it's going to continue.
[03:13:24.347 --> 03:13:36.458]  It's like the story of the pastor, I think it was Wurmbrand in Germany during the war, and you know, first they took away the Jews, and then they took away the
[03:13:37.606 --> 03:13:42.670]  The Catholics, and then they took away the dissidents and so on and so forth.
[03:13:42.670 --> 03:13:44.371]  And then they came for me.
[03:13:44.371 --> 03:13:47.433]  And it's the same thing.
[03:13:47.433 --> 03:13:58.400]  It's incumbent upon us who understand, no matter how frustrating it is, to let the public know things that they don't know that they should know.
[03:13:58.400 --> 03:13:59.901]  And that's why we're doing what we're doing.
[03:13:59.901 --> 03:14:02.823]  I mean, who do you know that's 74 years old, like I am,
[03:14:03.786 --> 03:14:08.252]  Who does 30 hours of programming a week and publishes two publications.
[03:14:08.252 --> 03:14:09.373]  I want to help people.
[03:14:09.373 --> 03:14:11.095]  I want people to know.
[03:14:11.095 --> 03:14:13.118]  And that's what Alex is all about.
[03:14:13.118 --> 03:14:21.048]  And if all of you people out there who are listening take this knowledge and please spread it no matter how many times you reject it.
[03:14:22.076 --> 03:14:28.819]  Well, people aren't rejecting it as much anymore, and that's why I beg the listeners, get Fall of the Republic, this film.
[03:14:28.819 --> 03:14:34.202]  And I'm asking all our supporters and other websites, write reviews of it, support it.
[03:14:34.202 --> 03:14:37.143]  We just want to get this out, we want to save the republic.
[03:14:37.143 --> 03:14:38.744]  Let's talk to Hannibal in New York.
[03:14:38.744 --> 03:14:40.224]  Hannibal, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[03:14:40.224 --> 03:14:43.346]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:14:43.346 --> 03:14:45.327]  Good.
[03:14:45.327 --> 03:14:50.249]  I want to say thank you for all you're doing, and thank you for some advice you gave me last year about
[03:14:51.226 --> 03:14:51.786]  Yeah, I moved on.
[03:14:51.786 --> 03:14:55.009]  Next thing you know, a couple of them came back to me, like, how'd you know all this stuff?
[03:14:55.009 --> 03:14:57.451]  I'm like, Alex Jones, I've got a few friends listening to ya.
[03:15:13.877 --> 03:15:16.461]  I have a video that I think you might find interesting.
[03:15:16.461 --> 03:15:22.068]  I named it NYPD openly violates my rights.
[03:15:22.068 --> 03:15:30.220]  And they actually say and use the Patriot Act to detain me for taking pictures at the UN in Midtown.
[03:15:31.383 --> 03:15:34.445]  Yeah, you got thousands of tourists out there every hour.
[03:15:34.445 --> 03:15:35.606]  My guy's been harassed.
[03:15:35.606 --> 03:15:40.348]  Rob Jacobson has shot video at the UN three times for my films.
[03:15:40.348 --> 03:15:44.651]  And every time, cops come over and go, you're not allowed to have a tripod.
[03:15:44.651 --> 03:15:45.852]  Get across the street.
[03:15:45.852 --> 03:15:49.614]  And now it's, you're not allowed to even have a little camera, punk.
[03:15:49.614 --> 03:15:53.016]  What do you think this is, the land of the free, home of the brave?
[03:15:53.016 --> 03:15:56.358]  It's the land of take your shot and have a heart attack.
[03:15:57.443 --> 03:16:01.806]  Yeah, I was stating my constitution and what my rights are.
[03:16:01.806 --> 03:16:03.908]  Constitution!
[03:16:03.908 --> 03:16:05.429]  Constitution!
[03:16:05.429 --> 03:16:11.253]  You got a right to me to kick your teeth in, punk!
[03:16:11.253 --> 03:16:13.294]  What do you think this is?
[03:16:13.294 --> 03:16:15.756]  Some kind of free country?
[03:16:15.756 --> 03:16:19.098]  I'll learn you, you little constitutional rat!
[03:16:19.098 --> 03:16:19.799]  You traitor!
[03:16:21.499 --> 03:16:27.102]  Yeah, um... We're a country of abortions and disease and drug dealers!
[03:16:27.102 --> 03:16:29.143]  We're a country of the Mafia now!
[03:16:29.143 --> 03:16:33.105]  Pretty much.
[03:16:33.105 --> 03:16:36.346]  And, um, they didn't tell me what law I was being detained under.
[03:16:36.346 --> 03:16:38.327]  They just kept saying the Patriot Act.
[03:16:38.327 --> 03:16:40.008]  They're taking pictures across the street.
[03:16:40.606 --> 03:16:41.587]  of the U.N.
[03:16:41.587 --> 03:16:44.728]  and I actually have some officers... You don't do that!
[03:16:44.728 --> 03:16:46.209]  ...at the M-16s.
[03:16:46.209 --> 03:16:47.970]  You might be's as a terrorist.
[03:16:47.970 --> 03:16:49.671]  Send us the video, we'll post it.
[03:16:49.671 --> 03:16:51.171]  Good to hear from you, Hannibal.
[03:16:51.171 --> 03:16:54.833]  Terry in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:16:54.833 --> 03:16:55.874]  Hello, Alex.
[03:16:55.874 --> 03:16:58.355]  Hey buddy, you're on the air with Bob Chapman, go ahead.
[03:16:58.355 --> 03:17:00.416]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[03:17:00.416 --> 03:17:03.778]  Sorry if I sound a little worked up today, but just letting you know
[03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:11.205]  My girlfriend actually just got threatened with her job today for the H1 swine flu vaccine.
[03:17:11.205 --> 03:17:14.387]  Oh yeah, they're forcibly injecting kids at schools everywhere.
[03:17:14.387 --> 03:17:17.710]  Even if the parents say no, they're threatening to fire everybody.
[03:17:17.710 --> 03:17:20.492]  Again, it's just total mafia.
[03:17:20.492 --> 03:17:22.234]  They're starting to do that with me at my job.
[03:17:22.234 --> 03:17:23.715]  I'm a federal peace officer here.
[03:17:23.715 --> 03:17:28.098]  And non-stop, I'm spreading your word.
[03:17:28.098 --> 03:17:30.480]  I'm so worked up about this.
[03:17:30.480 --> 03:17:32.362]  She's been upset about this.
[03:17:32.362 --> 03:17:33.463]  We don't know what to do, I called.
[03:17:34.793 --> 03:17:36.755]  Lawyer after lawyer in the phone book.
[03:17:36.755 --> 03:17:40.238]  So are you Customs or are you Royal Mountain Police?
[03:17:40.238 --> 03:17:49.385]  I am actually with the, well, one organization I would like to stay on the air about.
[03:17:49.385 --> 03:17:59.354]  And so they're there even though your own government, but that's good, scientists in the government, have said that it actually hurts you that your bosses are saying take it?
[03:17:59.354 --> 03:18:01.896]  That you have to take it or you're losing your job and they're telling us
[03:18:02.529 --> 03:18:03.630]  That's right.
[03:18:15.996 --> 03:18:21.364]  If you don't take this, you're getting fired, and we know it's not proven, we know it's bad, but you're taking it anyway.
[03:18:34.036 --> 03:18:37.738]  It's going to continue as long as we let it.
[03:18:37.738 --> 03:18:42.741]  And it's hard to get any help from attorneys because they're afraid to touch it.
[03:18:42.741 --> 03:18:44.622]  They're terrified of the government.
[03:18:44.622 --> 03:18:50.486]  And you'd be amazed how many people are terrified who are not employed by the government.
[03:19:04.085 --> 03:19:06.326]  And so all we can do is get the word out.
[03:19:06.326 --> 03:19:08.186]  Don't take the shots no matter what.
[03:19:08.186 --> 03:19:10.167]  If it costs you a job, it costs you a job.
[03:19:10.167 --> 03:19:16.009]  One of the good things is if you get a 401k, you can then manage it yourself.
[03:19:16.009 --> 03:19:19.670]  Let me ask this fellow a question in closing.
[03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:24.572]  Terry in Canada, are other peace officers that you work with, are they starting to wake up?
[03:19:25.652 --> 03:19:37.575]  Oh they are, tons of them are and I've spread and spread many of your DVDs at work and you know for the longest time I was laughed at and ridiculed and cornered and just, you're crazy, you're a fool, you're a fool.
[03:19:37.575 --> 03:19:42.096]  And I, you know, had my facts down about 9-11 and everything, you know, straight as an arrow.
[03:19:42.096 --> 03:19:44.197]  Look it up yourself I said, like, do your own research.
[03:19:44.855 --> 03:19:47.957]  And they sit and laugh in a big group, heckling me.
[03:19:47.957 --> 03:19:50.938]  And then, shortly after, I'll walk away.
[03:19:50.938 --> 03:19:55.440]  One or two of them come up and say, hey, by the way, where did, uh, where did you find that information?
[03:19:55.440 --> 03:19:56.581]  Do you have one of those DVDs?
[03:19:56.581 --> 03:19:57.481]  Amazing.
[03:19:57.481 --> 03:19:58.262]  God bless you, sir.
[03:19:58.262 --> 03:19:58.662]  Keep it up.
[03:19:58.662 --> 03:20:00.222]  I want to say bye to Bob during the break.
[03:20:00.222 --> 03:20:01.003]  I may even bring him back.
[03:20:01.403 --> 03:20:05.284]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Calbin Soap.
[03:20:05.284 --> 03:20:15.446]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[03:20:15.446 --> 03:20:19.367]  Go to 5starsoaps.com or click on their link at infowars.com.
[03:20:19.367 --> 03:20:21.328]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:20:21.328 --> 03:20:25.148]  Calbin Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[03:20:25.148 --> 03:20:27.309]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[03:20:27.729 --> 03:20:32.913]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.
[03:20:32.913 --> 03:20:37.956]  Check out their whole line of bath, hair, laundry, and dish soap and more at 5starsoap.com.
[03:20:37.956 --> 03:20:42.880]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[03:20:43.320 --> 03:20:44.602]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:20:44.602 --> 03:20:53.412]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling toll-free 1-800-340-7091 or check them out online at 5starsoap.com.
[03:20:53.412 --> 03:20:56.956]  Again, go to 5starsoap.com and just try their products.
[03:20:56.956 --> 03:20:57.917]  You're gonna love them.
[03:20:57.917 --> 03:20:59.539]  You will never use anything else again.
[03:21:03.243 --> 03:21:04.684]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:04.684 --> 03:21:10.749]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[03:21:10.749 --> 03:21:11.570]  That's right.
[03:21:11.570 --> 03:21:14.412]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[03:21:14.412 --> 03:21:21.898]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[03:21:21.898 --> 03:21:29.524]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:21:30.024 --> 03:21:35.506]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[03:21:35.506 --> 03:21:41.309]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:41.309 --> 03:21:45.831]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[03:21:45.831 --> 03:21:46.091]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:46.091 --> 03:21:48.092]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[03:21:48.092 --> 03:21:48.692]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:48.692 --> 03:21:48.952]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:02.620 --> 03:22:06.668]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:06.668 --> 03:22:09.895]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:09.895 --> 03:22:11.317]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:22:12.003 --> 03:22:14.706]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:14.706 --> 03:22:21.091]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.091 --> 03:22:26.256]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.256 --> 03:22:36.265]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.385 --> 03:22:38.727]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.727 --> 03:22:40.308]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.308 --> 03:22:42.769]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.769 --> 03:22:44.891]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:44.891 --> 03:22:50.054]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.054 --> 03:23:01.221]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:01.221 --> 03:23:03.763]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to
[03:23:05.742 --> 03:23:06.382]  We're good to go.
[03:23:32.219 --> 03:23:38.664]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.
[03:23:38.664 --> 03:23:48.433]  BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com would like to offer GCN listeners 5% off all ceramic filter systems and ship all orders over $50 free of charge.
[03:23:48.433 --> 03:23:50.975]  Visit BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[03:23:50.975 --> 03:23:52.937]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[03:23:52.937 --> 03:23:53.717]  Or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:23:53.717 --> 03:23:54.338]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[03:24:10.532 --> 03:24:12.012]  All right.
[03:24:12.012 --> 03:24:19.095]  Two of my crew members, Rob Dew and Aaron Dykes, as free men, try to travel around the country.
[03:24:19.095 --> 03:24:22.616]  And just like in the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, it ain't easy.
[03:24:22.616 --> 03:24:28.218]  And the forms of humiliation, the naked body scanners going in nationwide are in use.
[03:24:28.218 --> 03:24:30.818]  You're going to put your five-year-old son and daughters through it.
[03:24:30.818 --> 03:24:32.179]  You're going to submit.
[03:24:32.179 --> 03:24:35.960]  And if you don't go through the naked body scanner, a big goon's going to put their hands on you.
[03:24:38.752 --> 03:24:40.915]  On screen, there is your genitalia.
[03:24:40.915 --> 03:24:51.550]  I'm sorry, this is what they're recording on digital scanners, and that's just a... You can see that man's man breast right there.
[03:24:51.550 --> 03:24:52.552]  That's a woman right there.
[03:24:54.312 --> 03:24:58.093]  Just Google live science image gallery.
[03:24:58.093 --> 03:25:06.255]  What did you guys search to find all those nudie pictures recorded by the airport perverts?
[03:25:06.255 --> 03:25:08.635]  Airport body scanners and just click images.
[03:25:08.635 --> 03:25:14.857]  Just click image for everybody watching on PrisonPlanet.tv and then others listening will go do this themselves.
[03:25:14.857 --> 03:25:17.197]  Oh, look at that!
[03:25:17.197 --> 03:25:19.478]  The genitalia, everything.
[03:25:19.478 --> 03:25:23.159]  Zoom in on that woman in the middle there.
[03:25:23.159 --> 03:25:23.739]  There you go.
[03:25:27.130 --> 03:25:29.891]  And that's turned up on low-res.
[03:25:29.891 --> 03:25:37.054]  Look at the guy with the gun behind his back.
[03:25:37.054 --> 03:25:38.014]  Oh, the humiliation.
[03:25:38.014 --> 03:25:44.016]  What they don't tell you is it's a biometric signature so they can scan you with these different resonance machines.
[03:25:44.016 --> 03:25:47.057]  That's the big secret technology they talk about that they have in Iraq.
[03:25:47.057 --> 03:25:49.238]  Bob Chapman, what do you think of the naked body scanners?
[03:25:49.238 --> 03:25:51.299]  Isn't that freedom?
[03:25:51.299 --> 03:25:53.420]  That's disgraceful.
[03:25:53.420 --> 03:25:56.321]  This disgraceful is no reason for it whatsoever.
[03:25:57.262 --> 03:26:02.207]  And we haven't had a terrorist incident except what the government created in 9-11.
[03:26:02.207 --> 03:26:09.874]  It's a big scam and it's just another way to control and humiliate people.
[03:26:09.874 --> 03:26:14.559]  But imagine if your neighbor said, walk in this machine, I'm going to record naked images of your body.
[03:26:14.559 --> 03:26:19.704]  But at the airport, I mean look at these shots we've got up on screen of women lined up with the
[03:26:21.107 --> 03:26:23.729]  For some reason, you've got to be an overweight to be in the TSA.
[03:26:23.729 --> 03:26:28.033]  Nothing against it, it's just that you've got to weigh over 400 pounds to be in the TSA.
[03:26:28.033 --> 03:26:29.795]  That's like a prerequisite.
[03:26:29.795 --> 03:26:34.619]  And then, blow it up right there, those two on the left.
[03:26:34.619 --> 03:26:38.002]  And, you know, the TSA woman gets to scan the other lady.
[03:26:38.002 --> 03:26:41.925]  And she's like, hmm.
[03:26:41.925 --> 03:26:42.606]  You will pay.
[03:26:43.888 --> 03:26:44.529]  Look at this one.
[03:26:44.529 --> 03:26:46.911]  Nice, nice image on the screen.
[03:26:46.911 --> 03:26:48.932]  You're submitting oil to me.
[03:26:48.932 --> 03:26:51.134]  And in England, they've got mobile body scanners.
[03:26:51.134 --> 03:26:57.059]  Hey, Bob, tell folks, oh yeah, there's an airport scanner inside the body.
[03:26:57.059 --> 03:26:58.861]  How do you like that?
[03:26:58.861 --> 03:27:00.242]  Scan inside people's guts.
[03:27:00.242 --> 03:27:04.245]  You know, they can turn those up on a higher res and look into your body.
[03:27:04.245 --> 03:27:06.027]  Bob, tell folks about the International Forecaster.
[03:27:06.027 --> 03:27:08.309]  Then go to theinternationalforecaster.com and get a free copy.
[03:27:09.270 --> 03:27:10.271]  Absolutely.
[03:27:10.271 --> 03:27:13.073]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[03:27:13.073 --> 03:27:15.135]  And if they want as well, they can go to 877-479-8178.
[03:27:15.135 --> 03:27:15.896]  That's toll free.
[03:27:15.896 --> 03:27:15.956]  877-479-8178.
[03:27:15.956 --> 03:27:18.558]  Either by email or in hard copy.
[03:27:18.558 --> 03:27:19.779]  Hey Bob, where's gold today?
[03:27:19.779 --> 03:27:22.021]  Uh, most of the day it's been off about $8.
[03:27:36.927 --> 03:27:45.010]  And we're seeing this reaction to the stock market being off about 250 points.
[03:27:45.010 --> 03:27:48.832]  And so I think what you're seeing is some margin selling.
[03:27:48.832 --> 03:27:53.113]  And you get that in the gold shares as well at the beginning of a correction like that.
[03:27:53.113 --> 03:27:55.634]  After that, it levels out.
[03:27:55.634 --> 03:28:00.756]  When do you think it's going to go back above $1,060 again?
[03:28:00.756 --> 03:28:03.017]  Probably within the next couple of weeks.
[03:28:03.017 --> 03:28:03.997]  They can't hold it down.
[03:28:03.997 --> 03:28:05.358]  They don't have the physical to do it.
[03:28:05.859 --> 03:28:10.727]  All these mainline reporters and experts on MSNBC and CNBC-CNN, they're all saying $2,000.
[03:28:10.727 --> 03:28:11.729]  Do you think that's real?
[03:28:16.119 --> 03:28:37.593]  That's what they will admit to now, as will JPMorgan Chase and Goldman and so on, to $2,000, $2,500, which is a reflection of official inflation since 1980, when real inflation is $6,700 an ounce, and John Williams says $7,150 an ounce, so we're pretty close together up there.
[03:28:37.593 --> 03:28:39.154]  And there are others who say over $6,000.
[03:28:40.754 --> 03:28:46.559]  But we're always in the great, great, great minority, and we're usually always right.
[03:28:46.559 --> 03:28:51.743]  And so, don't listen to the garbage you get on mainline media.
[03:28:51.743 --> 03:28:54.505]  It'll bankrupt you.
[03:28:54.505 --> 03:28:57.727]  When do you think it's going to go above 2000?
[03:28:57.727 --> 03:29:00.610]  During this next year.
[03:29:00.610 --> 03:29:03.112]  You're certain of that, or near certain?
[03:29:03.112 --> 03:29:04.092]  I'm near certain.
[03:29:04.092 --> 03:29:07.155]  I think 1650 is going to be easy.
[03:29:07.155 --> 03:29:08.035]  Alright.
[03:29:08.035 --> 03:29:09.677]  Bob Chapman, thanks for spending time with us.
[03:29:10.600 --> 03:29:11.641]  All right, I'll see you next week.
[03:29:11.641 --> 03:29:11.921]  Bye-bye.
[03:29:41.701 --> 03:29:44.063]  Been number one on Amazon for the last month.
[03:29:44.063 --> 03:29:47.946]  I mean, a lot of cultural leaders are waking up.
[03:29:47.946 --> 03:29:50.208]  That's got to make the establishment mad.
[03:29:50.208 --> 03:29:51.810]  Stay with us.
[03:29:51.810 --> 03:29:53.191]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.191 --> 03:29:55.733]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.733 --> 03:29:58.415]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.129 --> 03:30:06.436]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.436 --> 03:30:10.962]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:10.962 --> 03:30:13.245]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?

[03:31:01.107 --> 03:31:10.252]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:31:10.252 --> 03:31:13.613]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:31:13.613 --> 03:31:19.476]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:31:19.476 --> 03:31:24.259]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:31:24.259 --> 03:31:26.620]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:31:26.880 --> 03:31:36.087]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[03:31:36.087 --> 03:31:41.631]  He also recommends ZeoLife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[03:32:06.695 --> 03:32:11.598]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[03:32:11.598 --> 03:32:16.602]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.

[03:33:12.150 --> 03:33:15.553]  Well, they were gone for close to a week, six days.
[03:33:15.553 --> 03:33:18.015]  They went to Detroit to witness the collapse there.
[03:33:18.015 --> 03:33:18.856]  Went back to D.C.
[03:33:18.856 --> 03:33:22.799]  to interview Webster Tarpley, a mainstay of the Fall of the Republic series.
[03:33:22.799 --> 03:33:25.522]  And then they went to Canada to interview Alan Watt.
[03:33:25.522 --> 03:33:26.703]  And what an adventure.
[03:33:26.703 --> 03:33:31.026]  You got hands laid on you when you just said, no, I'm not going to the naked body scanner.
[03:33:32.127 --> 03:33:33.669]  Uh, and, uh, this is a fraud.
[03:33:33.669 --> 03:33:36.872]  I mean, next they're going to want to do a proctology exam.
[03:33:36.872 --> 03:33:38.114]  Uh, you got stopped at the border.
[03:33:38.114 --> 03:33:42.678]  We had to fax proofs, uh, that the cameras that we have that aren't that expensive.
[03:33:42.678 --> 03:33:46.182]  They're pro-sumer, about five, six thousand dollars, depending on the model.
[03:33:46.182 --> 03:33:47.984]  Some we've got for like four grand.
[03:33:47.984 --> 03:33:49.746]  You had to prove that all that was yours.
[03:33:49.746 --> 03:33:50.947]  Thank God we were here.
[03:33:50.947 --> 03:33:51.908]  Thank God you got a hold of us.
[03:33:51.908 --> 03:33:53.429]  We did have the receipts.
[03:33:53.429 --> 03:33:54.470]  Dug them out, sent them.
[03:33:55.651 --> 03:33:57.753]  I mean, this is not a free country.
[03:33:57.753 --> 03:34:01.174]  This is pathetic, and so I wanted to have both of you break it down.
[03:34:01.174 --> 03:34:16.263]  Let's start with the airport adventures, which they now admit are going nationwide with the Viper teams at bus stops, train stops, the streets, shopping malls, random vans, sending you through body scanners, biometrically scanning 360, your naked body.
[03:34:16.263 --> 03:34:19.365]  If you've got children watching, it's like the Playboy channel.
[03:34:19.685 --> 03:34:20.165]  We're good to go.
[03:34:37.575 --> 03:34:50.160]  And this made ABC News and CNN, the children's bottoms weren't even seen, but because the children had towels around them, hugging, it was a three-year-old and two-year-old, they were arrested, their children were taken.
[03:34:50.160 --> 03:34:55.843]  So that's, things that aren't bad are called bad, but in the government recording, your naked wife, you, your children,
[03:34:56.903 --> 03:35:06.728]  And now they're going in at all major airports, 214, and people in Houston are being forced through them, but people are refusing and saying, no, you perverts, you're not going to do that.
[03:35:06.728 --> 03:35:10.070]  So tell us your adventures there, then we'll get into the collapse of Detroit.
[03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:11.871]  And for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers,
[03:35:12.651 --> 03:35:16.653]  For radio listeners, we're going to obviously post a video of this on YouTube.
[03:35:16.653 --> 03:35:20.836]  Some images of Detroit for Fall of the Republic 2.
[03:35:20.836 --> 03:35:24.738]  You guys were telling me it was worse than what the news could even capture.
[03:35:24.738 --> 03:35:32.282]  So, Aaron Dykes and Rob Dew, back from six days of adventure with the police state in Canada and the U.S., tell us what happened.
[03:35:33.117 --> 03:35:34.158]  Well, I got hit up first.
[03:35:34.158 --> 03:35:35.379]  This was in D.C.
[03:35:35.379 --> 03:35:36.300]  flying to Detroit.
[03:35:36.300 --> 03:35:37.481]  Because you got long hair.
[03:35:37.481 --> 03:35:39.403]  You get pulled out every time.
[03:35:39.403 --> 03:35:41.325]  Some kind of Al-Qaeda!
[03:35:41.325 --> 03:35:54.077]  But, uh, what... Aaron was already through security, and I went through, you know, take off all your possessions, put them on the scanner, and take off all your shoes, and then I walked through and they go, oh, sir, can you step in here?
[03:35:54.858 --> 03:35:56.299]  I said, so what's that?
[03:35:56.299 --> 03:35:58.820]  And they said, oh, this is our RFID scanner.
[03:35:58.820 --> 03:36:00.580]  I said, no, I'm not going in there.
[03:36:00.580 --> 03:36:02.001]  And, uh, what do you mean?
[03:36:02.001 --> 03:36:03.421]  And I said, I'm not going in there.
[03:36:03.421 --> 03:36:04.842]  I don't, I said, I don't agree with that.
[03:36:04.842 --> 03:36:06.143]  And they said, oh, well, it's voluntary.
[03:36:06.143 --> 03:36:06.623]  I said, well, good.
[03:36:06.623 --> 03:36:07.523]  I'm not doing it.
[03:36:07.523 --> 03:36:07.663]  Yeah.
[03:36:07.663 --> 03:36:09.984]  But so that's like SeaWorld made you thumbprint.
[03:36:09.984 --> 03:36:11.085]  At first it was voluntary.
[03:36:11.085 --> 03:36:12.365]  Now it's mandatory.
[03:36:12.365 --> 03:36:13.506]  It's like dog training.
[03:36:13.506 --> 03:36:13.986]  It's going to happen.
[03:36:13.986 --> 03:36:18.848]  Because so many people have refused, but, but, but, but they don't tell you just like they say it's shot time.
[03:36:18.848 --> 03:36:20.588]  They don't say you don't have to take it.
[03:36:20.588 --> 03:36:22.209]  But, but, but, but you said you went further.
[03:36:22.209 --> 03:36:24.550]  You explained you're not going to videotape my package.
[03:36:24.750 --> 03:36:25.670]  Oh yeah.
[03:36:25.670 --> 03:36:31.753]  Well, the guys started asking me why I wasn't doing it and I said, well, I gave them several reasons why I didn't want to do it.
[03:36:31.753 --> 03:36:33.913]  And then I jokingly gave them a reason.
[03:36:33.913 --> 03:36:39.996]  I said, well, I don't want you guys to feel bad when you see the size of my privates or whatever.
[03:36:39.996 --> 03:36:41.356]  You know, just trying to lighten the mood.
[03:36:41.356 --> 03:36:42.917]  Because they got kind of serious about it.
[03:36:42.917 --> 03:36:44.737]  So we have to wand you and pat you down.
[03:36:44.737 --> 03:36:46.558]  And I said, well, I don't agree with that.
[03:36:46.558 --> 03:36:52.060]  And then we find this article about terahertz waves, which is what they use to do this scanner.
[03:36:52.060 --> 03:36:52.820]  This came in today.
[03:36:54.361 --> 03:36:57.463]  According to one of their studies, I'm just going to read this real quick.
[03:36:57.463 --> 03:37:05.006]  They find the terahertz waves interact with the double-stranded DNA and what they found is that the forces generated are tiny and resonant.
[03:37:05.006 --> 03:37:16.152]  They allow the THZ waves, which are the terahertz waves, to unzip the double-stranded DNA creating bubbles in the double-strand which could significantly interfere with the processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.
[03:37:16.232 --> 03:37:18.273]  And let me stop you, because I'm going to quit interrupting.
[03:37:18.273 --> 03:37:27.918]  I want you to start over and tell the whole story, and then get into that, because they now, the British government and others, have conclusively admitted that they knew in the early 80s, when in the U.S.
[03:37:27.918 --> 03:37:33.341]  and Europe, they approved cell phones, bag phones at the time, that it resonates the DNA.
[03:37:33.341 --> 03:37:34.742]  That's why you get the brain tumors.
[03:37:34.742 --> 03:37:38.023]  It breaks down the cell DNA, making them mutate.
[03:37:38.023 --> 03:37:38.844]  They know this.
[03:37:38.844 --> 03:37:43.026]  Now, these machines they put you in are conservatively, according to the reports,
[03:37:43.166 --> 03:37:43.486]  I don't know.
[03:37:58.945 --> 03:38:01.566]  Yeah, in Phoenix, you know, they got the signs.
[03:38:01.566 --> 03:38:02.786]  They know people don't like this.
[03:38:02.786 --> 03:38:04.987]  Guaranteed it's making people late for their flights.
[03:38:04.987 --> 03:38:06.428]  The lines are backed up.
[03:38:06.428 --> 03:38:08.468]  So far, they have to create new lines.
[03:38:08.468 --> 03:38:10.669]  It says, why do I have to take my shoes off?
[03:38:10.669 --> 03:38:13.530]  Well, because explosives can be hidden in them, of course.
[03:38:13.530 --> 03:38:16.331]  But don't worry, because the body scanners are coming soon.
[03:38:16.331 --> 03:38:19.792]  And so there's a problem reaction, problem reaction solution.
[03:38:19.792 --> 03:38:21.353]  So step in the microwave.
[03:38:21.353 --> 03:38:26.594]  And of course, the fools don't know that the reports you've pulled up and I've looked at it, these things are leaking.
[03:38:26.594 --> 03:38:28.615]  But the TSA guys are going to love dying of cancer.
[03:38:28.735 --> 03:38:29.155]  Oh yeah.
[03:38:29.155 --> 03:38:30.156]  This is fun.
[03:38:30.156 --> 03:38:31.657]  They're all around it.
[03:38:31.657 --> 03:38:32.678]  The thing's right there.
[03:38:32.678 --> 03:38:34.340]  Well, see, that's kind of the good thing, though.
[03:38:34.340 --> 03:38:36.081]  See, evil always gets judged.
[03:38:36.081 --> 03:38:37.242]  These guys make excuses.
[03:38:37.242 --> 03:38:41.686]  They're going to make excuses about scanning naked children, scanning naked women and men.
[03:38:41.686 --> 03:38:44.468]  They're going to make excuses about how it doesn't hurt you.
[03:38:44.468 --> 03:38:46.269]  They're the ones that are going to die first.
[03:38:46.269 --> 03:38:47.871]  Eight hours a day standing around it.
[03:38:47.871 --> 03:38:50.493]  And I'm sad for them, but this is what they want.
[03:38:50.493 --> 03:38:51.554]  This is what they get.
[03:38:52.034 --> 03:38:53.955]  Well, we the people are going to accept it too.
[03:38:53.955 --> 03:38:57.496]  We're going to let our children's genitals be scanned and, you know, we're going to take it.
[03:38:57.496 --> 03:38:59.277]  We're going to take off our shoes, everything they ask.
[03:38:59.277 --> 03:39:01.097]  Because we're Land of the Coward, Home of the Slave.
[03:39:01.097 --> 03:39:01.457]  Right.
[03:39:01.457 --> 03:39:04.638]  And then it gets, when Aaron went through, it was even worse because I was behind him.
[03:39:04.638 --> 03:39:08.920]  Tell them about your... Yeah, I went through, he told me to go through the scanner and I said no.
[03:39:09.600 --> 03:39:10.842]  He said, why aren't you going to do it?
[03:39:10.842 --> 03:39:12.844]  I said, it violates my privacy.
[03:39:12.844 --> 03:39:13.845]  And this is what happened.
[03:39:13.845 --> 03:39:15.407]  This guy got scared.
[03:39:15.407 --> 03:39:17.049]  This guy was bigger than me.
[03:39:17.049 --> 03:39:17.910]  He was athletic.
[03:39:17.910 --> 03:39:20.072]  He started shaking when I said no.
[03:39:20.072 --> 03:39:21.113]  You think it doesn't matter?
[03:39:21.113 --> 03:39:22.615]  Because it's a delusional world.
[03:39:22.615 --> 03:39:24.137]  He thought he found a real terrorist.
[03:39:24.497 --> 03:39:25.157]  Yeah.
[03:39:25.157 --> 03:39:28.498]  He was shaking, visibly shaking, when I said no.
[03:39:28.498 --> 03:39:33.499]  He tried to trick me to go through it again and told me they were going to body wand me, which they ended up doing.
[03:39:33.499 --> 03:39:39.200]  And then he tells me, oh, because I don't like it, because it violates my fourth amendment, I read too much.
[03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:41.040]  Oh, you're one of those who reads too much.
[03:39:41.040 --> 03:39:42.480]  And you said he put his hands on you.
[03:39:42.480 --> 03:39:42.900]  Oh yeah.
[03:39:42.900 --> 03:39:43.841]  Oh yeah, he grabbed me, just like this.
[03:39:43.841 --> 03:39:50.602]  When I said no, he started shaking, he didn't know what to do, and then his first flinch reaction was to grab my arm and try to pull me through the scanner.
[03:39:54.891 --> 03:39:58.392]  By the way, I told the story about Montana.
[03:39:58.392 --> 03:40:02.433]  Was I exaggerating a month ago at Hardin?
[03:40:02.433 --> 03:40:04.313]  Because now they've made it easier.
[03:40:04.313 --> 03:40:12.895]  First they're on you to train you to be a slave, then they ease it back, and they've been, oh, soothing music, colors, blue outfits, not black.
[03:40:12.895 --> 03:40:17.577]  But then they still have the old training in Montana.
[03:40:17.577 --> 03:40:18.397]  Describe what it was like.
[03:40:18.857 --> 03:40:20.177]  It was absolutely crazy.
[03:40:20.177 --> 03:40:22.318]  And you got women apologizing to the agents.
[03:40:22.318 --> 03:40:25.439]  I'm so sorry I forgot my mascara and my lipstick.
[03:40:25.439 --> 03:40:31.701]  And the Fourth Amendment says if you're going to search, you're not only going to have a warrant, you're going to say specifically what you're looking for.
[03:40:31.701 --> 03:40:32.661]  But it's not specific.
[03:40:32.661 --> 03:40:33.381]  It's liquids.
[03:40:33.381 --> 03:40:34.082]  It's lipstick.
[03:40:34.082 --> 03:40:35.082]  It could be shoes.
[03:40:35.082 --> 03:40:35.462]  It could be...
[03:40:36.203 --> 03:40:39.505]  And they started yelling at me for a thing of shampoo I took from the hotel.
[03:40:39.505 --> 03:40:41.467]  And I said, your own rule says that's allowed.
[03:40:41.467 --> 03:40:44.369]  And she kind of got mad and said, it's for your safety.
[03:40:44.369 --> 03:40:49.393]  But going back, read what the scanners do to your body.
[03:40:49.393 --> 03:40:53.175]  And the TSA guys, again, you need to know why you're going to be dying in five years of cancer.
[03:40:53.175 --> 03:40:53.436]  Go ahead.
[03:40:54.556 --> 03:40:56.278]  And there's no doubt that's what this is for.
[03:40:56.278 --> 03:40:57.679]  This is the new cookers.
[03:40:57.679 --> 03:41:00.981]  And they admit that they, in England, they have them that are so powerful.
[03:41:00.981 --> 03:41:03.964]  They're body x-ray machines they use to scan cars.
[03:41:03.964 --> 03:41:07.947]  I mean, these are hundreds of times more powerful than a chest x-ray.
[03:41:07.947 --> 03:41:09.668]  They're marching everybody through those now.
[03:41:09.668 --> 03:41:10.749]  And it goes everywhere.
[03:41:10.749 --> 03:41:14.052]  Can you imagine what this is going to do to somebody who's pregnant?
[03:41:14.052 --> 03:41:14.952]  All the better!
[03:41:14.952 --> 03:41:15.473]  I know.
[03:41:15.473 --> 03:41:16.093]  All the better.
[03:41:16.093 --> 03:41:16.694]  Kill a baby.
[03:41:17.314 --> 03:41:22.516]  The headline, and we're probably going to post this up, is how terahertz waves tear apart DNA.
[03:41:22.516 --> 03:41:28.719]  And it talks about some studies they're doing in Los Alamos in New Mexico.
[03:41:28.719 --> 03:41:30.500]  And I'll go back and read this again.
[03:41:30.500 --> 03:41:35.162]  Terahertz waves are in the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared.
[03:41:35.162 --> 03:41:38.884]  And they pass through non-conductive materials such as clothes, paper, wood, and brick.
[03:41:40.305 --> 03:41:48.252]  But they can make them sensitive so they can peer inside envelopes and into living rooms and frisk people at a distance is what they say in quotes.
[03:41:48.252 --> 03:41:56.660]  And then this, his name is Boyan, B-O-I-A-N, Elendroff from the Center of Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos.
[03:41:56.660 --> 03:41:58.742]  This is basically what they've determined from their report.
[03:41:59.932 --> 03:42:16.803]  They say the forces that are generated by these THZ fields are tiny and resonant effects that allow the THZ waves to unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles in the strand that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.
[03:42:17.694 --> 03:42:32.418]  Now, that sounds like they're just... Now, for those that don't know, the BBC, AP Reuters, all this week, finally said, okay, it's conclusive, it gives you cancer, and, in fact, Google cell phones and brain tumors.
[03:42:32.418 --> 03:42:35.859]  And in the latest news, you'll see hundreds of articles every few days.
[03:42:35.859 --> 03:42:38.360]  We'll see the actual number here in a moment together.
[03:42:38.360 --> 03:42:39.620]  Cell phones and cancer.
[03:42:40.891 --> 03:42:42.872]  And it's the same waves.
[03:42:42.872 --> 03:42:50.354]  And it admits, they admit that the average cell phone, they have sites that show you how much radiation, microwave radiation they leak.
[03:42:50.354 --> 03:42:58.517]  But on average, and I've looked at the studies, between 10 and 15 minutes on a cell phone, the brain goes up over a degree and a half.
[03:42:58.517 --> 03:43:02.438]  It actually heats your brain.
[03:43:02.438 --> 03:43:05.339]  And this is the new system.
[03:43:05.339 --> 03:43:08.140]  You say no, they're gonna put you on a terror list, they admit that.
[03:43:09.065 --> 03:43:11.407]  And then soon it'll just be, you don't get to travel.
[03:43:11.407 --> 03:43:14.569]  So it's take your shoes off, take your belt off, go through a body scanner.
[03:43:14.569 --> 03:43:16.971]  More, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[03:43:16.971 --> 03:43:19.833]  It's all about training you for submission.
[03:43:19.833 --> 03:43:20.954]  There it is.
[03:43:20.954 --> 03:43:24.037]  World Health Organization, cell phones linked to brain cancer again.
[03:43:24.037 --> 03:43:25.177]  And, uh...
[03:43:27.202 --> 03:43:30.443]  That's copied to a blog.
[03:43:30.443 --> 03:43:31.304]  Go back to news.
[03:43:31.304 --> 03:43:33.905]  I want to pick a big mainstream publication to show it to folks.
[03:43:33.905 --> 03:43:36.826]  I mean, it's guaranteed, but this isn't a cell phone.
[03:43:36.826 --> 03:43:41.507]  This is a high-powered bather that bathes you in microwaves.
[03:43:41.507 --> 03:43:43.108]  It looks like something out of the fly.
[03:43:43.108 --> 03:43:49.310]  It bathes you in it, just blasting you with this RF.
[03:43:49.310 --> 03:43:51.331]  But I mean, the good news is within five years,
[03:43:54.392 --> 03:44:00.980]  Again, this stuff is set to only go in about an inch, and I've seen the studies, just like radar guns and police testicles.
[03:44:02.970 --> 03:44:14.979]  And I tell the cops don't keep between your legs and they admit now it gives them testicular and it's sad but it's also good because all these guys who are can't get you know they're all going to get testicular cancer and then they're going to have to remove the machines.
[03:44:14.979 --> 03:44:21.023]  That's the but of course we'll try to cover that up now and that's what the soft kill is where they just admit vaccines are killing you but keep doing it.
[03:44:21.023 --> 03:44:24.586]  See they're trying to train us that all this kills us and we just put up with it.
[03:44:24.586 --> 03:44:25.647]  Aaron you want to comment on all this?
[03:44:26.167 --> 03:44:29.991]  Yeah, I want to comment on the fact that they keep pushing it further and further.
[03:44:29.991 --> 03:44:32.153]  They're not prepared for our non-cooperation.
[03:44:32.153 --> 03:44:33.194]  That's the key.
[03:44:33.194 --> 03:44:35.496]  When you say no, that guy started shaking.
[03:44:35.496 --> 03:44:36.356]  They don't know what to do.
[03:44:36.356 --> 03:44:43.323]  And it's the same thing with these 50-mile-in border checks that Pastor Anderson in Arizona, he's not the only one doing it now.
[03:44:43.323 --> 03:44:46.466]  Now there's whole groups doing it, and they don't know how to react.
[03:44:46.466 --> 03:44:49.669]  All they can do is realize that they are violating the Fourth Amendment.
[03:44:50.349 --> 03:44:53.912]  And that's the same thing Gandhi started with his non-cooperation.
[03:44:53.912 --> 03:45:03.240]  They tried to profile and force Indians to register and fingerprint, fingerprinting developed by Francis Galton, creator of eugenics, and he resisted.
[03:45:03.240 --> 03:45:04.161]  That's what it's all about.
[03:45:04.161 --> 03:45:12.828]  They keep trying to invade our privacy, and it's always been government taking it too far, and if you let them keep taking it, that's all that's going to happen.
[03:45:13.717 --> 03:45:18.578]  There's the National Cancer Institute with all the studies of how it causes cancer.
[03:45:18.578 --> 03:45:23.499]  But let's remember, and I've seen these studies, thousand times stronger.
[03:45:23.499 --> 03:45:26.020]  I mean, this is life and death.
[03:45:26.020 --> 03:45:32.281]  They're trying to stick you in a radiation chamber like you're one of those foster kids they were murdering in the 50s.
[03:45:32.281 --> 03:45:37.062]  And don't these jackasses understand those things are leaking and blasting them?
[03:45:37.062 --> 03:45:38.302]  I've seen them walk through it too.
[03:45:38.302 --> 03:45:40.583]  They walk, oh it's okay, you just walk through it.
[03:45:40.583 --> 03:45:40.743]  Yeah.
[03:45:41.786 --> 03:45:43.968]  It's going to be okay when you get cancer too, I guess.
[03:45:43.968 --> 03:45:46.210]  You know, that's what's going to happen to them.
[03:45:46.210 --> 03:45:51.775]  And we've got emails and calls pouring in, and then it's in the news that suddenly they're forcibly inoculating kids nationwide.
[03:45:51.775 --> 03:45:53.896]  And just tell the parents, go to hell!
[03:45:53.896 --> 03:45:54.837]  Go to hell, people!
[03:45:54.837 --> 03:45:58.060]  We rule you now!
[03:45:58.060 --> 03:46:03.945]  Okay, we're going to talk more about this next week, and if you guys want to write a blurb about your experiences, because we need to start saying no to this.
[03:46:03.945 --> 03:46:05.626]  Aaron, I can tell you're really angry about this.
[03:46:05.626 --> 03:46:07.228]  Yeah, I can hardly put up with this.
[03:46:07.228 --> 03:46:07.928]  So how did it end?
[03:46:07.928 --> 03:46:09.330]  Did you say, hey, what are you doing grabbing me?
[03:46:10.049 --> 03:46:12.130]  Basically, it ended in a compromise.
[03:46:12.130 --> 03:46:18.773]  I submitted to a, uh, wanding, rather than going through the machine, but... And meanwhile, these bastards boss us Stage 9-11.
[03:46:18.773 --> 03:46:19.653]  Yeah.
[03:46:19.653 --> 03:46:22.555]  I mean, it's openly in the news that the CIA grows the opium now.
[03:46:22.555 --> 03:46:23.775]  They just admit it.
[03:46:23.775 --> 03:46:25.136]  But I shouldn't put up with any of it.
[03:46:25.136 --> 03:46:27.897]  I shouldn't let them look through every inch of my possessions.
[03:46:27.897 --> 03:46:30.178]  I'm supposed to be secure in my possessions.
[03:46:30.178 --> 03:46:36.121]  I shouldn't let them take off my shoes and my belt, look in my pockets, scan me over, pat me down.
[03:46:36.121 --> 03:46:38.282]  These are people who like touching people and looking at them.
[03:46:39.082 --> 03:46:40.743]  I mean, it's pretty perverted.
[03:46:40.743 --> 03:46:47.186]  It's perverted because they really, when the guy wanded me... They make pregnant women, women with babies, drink their milk?
[03:46:47.186 --> 03:46:47.427]  Yeah.
[03:46:47.427 --> 03:46:49.628]  And pull their clothes off and they beat them up?
[03:46:49.628 --> 03:46:56.031]  I saw that they made a guy unscrew his bottle and say, oh, we just need to do an aerosol sample.
[03:46:56.031 --> 03:46:58.232]  So they actually wand a little thing and beat him to drink it.
[03:46:58.232 --> 03:46:58.873]  It's all crap.
[03:46:58.873 --> 03:46:59.493]  It's all crap.
[03:46:59.493 --> 03:47:02.835]  And I forget the documentary that Michael Douglas narrates.
[03:47:02.835 --> 03:47:06.577]  It won an Academy Award about the Munich Olympics.
[03:47:06.577 --> 03:47:06.757]  Yeah.
[03:47:07.057 --> 03:47:10.339]  It's something, one day in September or something like that?
[03:47:10.339 --> 03:47:17.324]  The point is, at the end of the film, and it never made the news, they have the former head of the German security go, oh, we actually staged the hijackings to let them go.
[03:47:17.324 --> 03:47:18.485]  It was all staged.
[03:47:18.485 --> 03:47:19.025]  And laugh.
[03:47:19.025 --> 03:47:20.927]  So they just stage everything.
[03:47:20.927 --> 03:47:23.048]  And then even kill the patsies they've got involved.
[03:47:23.048 --> 03:47:25.610]  I mean, they tell them, you're going to be part of a drill.
[03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:28.372]  Going to do very well for you.
[03:47:28.372 --> 03:47:30.613]  Just like the morons on 7-7 in England.
[03:47:30.613 --> 03:47:31.874]  Turned out that was a drill.
[03:47:31.874 --> 03:47:33.095]  They just killed them.
[03:47:33.095 --> 03:47:34.316]  Oh yeah, you want to fight Al-Qaeda?
[03:47:34.316 --> 03:47:35.176]  Here's some bags.
[03:47:35.176 --> 03:47:36.137]  Carry these on board.
[03:47:38.584 --> 03:47:40.945]  And these aren't officers who took an oath.
[03:47:40.945 --> 03:47:43.387]  These aren't doctors who swore to do no harm.
[03:47:43.387 --> 03:47:48.649]  They're basically little tin-pug dictators on the cusp of taking things physical.
[03:47:48.649 --> 03:47:49.530]  They don't know how to handle it.
[03:47:49.530 --> 03:47:51.251]  What did you say when he grabbed you?
[03:47:51.251 --> 03:47:52.612]  I said, get your hands off me.
[03:47:52.612 --> 03:47:54.072]  That's my Fourth Amendment.
[03:47:54.072 --> 03:47:56.274]  I'm not going to let you invade my privacy.
[03:47:56.274 --> 03:47:58.475]  And he got so upset he didn't know what to do.
[03:47:58.475 --> 03:48:00.996]  All he could say was, you read too much.
[03:48:00.996 --> 03:48:02.177]  Because I knew what the Fourth Amendment was.
[03:48:02.177 --> 03:48:05.819]  No, no, they've literally gotten to the point, like idiocracy, going, he can read!
[03:48:05.819 --> 03:48:07.880]  What the hell is this, the crazy judge?
[03:48:08.200 --> 03:48:09.201]  What you reading for?
[03:48:09.201 --> 03:48:10.002]  Oh, it's dangerous.
[03:48:10.002 --> 03:48:16.027]  And I've talked to these ladies who get upset because they're late for their flights, but they say, oh, it's okay, I prefer to be secure.
[03:48:16.027 --> 03:48:22.652]  Don't you know Ben Franklin warned us that if we give up our liberty... Look, they're not going to be happy until them and their kids die of cancer.
[03:48:22.652 --> 03:48:26.095]  Let's start rolling the video for everybody of Detroit.
[03:48:26.095 --> 03:48:30.319]  At first it's some pretty scenes, but then it gets into the collapsed buildings, the ivy growing up.
[03:48:30.319 --> 03:48:31.019]  Start getting into that.
[03:48:31.019 --> 03:48:31.640]  What was that like?
[03:48:32.603 --> 03:48:33.364]  It's incredible.
[03:48:33.364 --> 03:48:43.790]  I mean, you're driving down blocks, you'll see beautiful houses with new paint jobs right next to burned down houses, empty lots where there used to be, you know, a hundred houses on the block.
[03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:46.692]  Now there's one, maybe two, maybe three.
[03:48:46.692 --> 03:48:47.913]  You'll see that all over the place.
[03:48:47.913 --> 03:48:49.314]  They call them urban prairies now.
[03:48:49.594 --> 03:48:50.975]  Yeah, that's the new word for it.
[03:48:50.975 --> 03:48:57.238]  And this guy was telling us how the neighborhood he used to live in, he used to be able to stick his hand out and touch his neighbor's house.
[03:48:57.238 --> 03:49:04.221]  And now you go through the neighborhood and it's one house, then empty lot, empty lot, empty lot, another house, then a burnout house, then empty lot, empty lot.
[03:49:04.861 --> 03:49:09.304]  They're just systematically tearing down Detroit, and you can see it coming up now.
[03:49:34.981 --> 03:49:49.319]  Yeah, they tried to basically set us up when we were entering Canada, said I can refuse you or you can get ready to prove that you didn't smuggle those cameras in or buy them illegally in Canada or without proper authorization using the customs.
[03:49:49.319 --> 03:49:50.801]  So they told you that when you were leaving?
[03:49:51.161 --> 03:49:56.102]  Oh yeah, they set us up for it, and indeed they did ask when we came back.
[03:49:56.102 --> 03:50:05.265]  So they said, prove you didn't steal the cameras in Canada, even though you were going into Canada, then they marked down your license plate, and they were waiting, because it was fun to harass a slave!
[03:50:05.265 --> 03:50:05.805]  That's right.
[03:50:05.805 --> 03:50:07.826]  To teach you to learn to serve, boy!
[03:50:07.826 --> 03:50:13.367]  Let's see, the problem is, everybody knows you can only buy left-handed cameras in Canada.
[03:50:13.367 --> 03:50:14.147]  You're joking, right?
[03:50:14.147 --> 03:50:16.088]  That's a joke, yeah.
[03:50:16.088 --> 03:50:17.528]  Dude, I'll tell you what.
[03:50:17.528 --> 03:50:20.229]  No, but seriously, what was that like?
[03:50:21.016 --> 03:50:21.396]  I think so.
[03:50:42.142 --> 03:50:43.884]  They weren't gonna let you go.
[03:50:43.884 --> 03:50:45.705]  We had to send receipts.
[03:50:45.705 --> 03:50:47.587]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[03:50:47.587 --> 03:50:49.749]  Meanwhile, illegals, criminals are everywhere.
[03:50:49.749 --> 03:50:51.411]  Madoff's stealing everything.
[03:50:51.411 --> 03:50:53.613]  Crime everywhere.
[03:50:53.613 --> 03:50:56.836]  But they gotta let you know, because you are the milk cow.
[03:50:56.836 --> 03:51:00.860]  And they were slapping you upside the head, going, look, Elsie, I own you.
[03:51:01.832 --> 03:51:03.614]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:51:03.614 --> 03:51:05.116]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:51:05.116 --> 03:51:06.457]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:51:06.457 --> 03:51:08.399]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:51:08.399 --> 03:51:17.188]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:51:17.188 --> 03:51:22.454]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:51:22.614 --> 03:51:24.396]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:51:24.396 --> 03:51:31.886]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[03:51:31.886 --> 03:51:36.072]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[03:51:36.072 --> 03:51:38.595]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.
[03:51:38.835 --> 03:51:39.215]  I think so.
[03:52:02.811 --> 03:52:06.841]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.841 --> 03:52:10.088]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.088 --> 03:52:11.511]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:12.205 --> 03:52:14.866]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:14.866 --> 03:52:21.248]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.248 --> 03:52:26.810]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.810 --> 03:52:36.433]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.553 --> 03:52:38.894]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:38.894 --> 03:52:40.495]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.495 --> 03:52:42.957]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:42.957 --> 03:52:45.078]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.078 --> 03:52:50.221]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.221 --> 03:52:59.347]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:01.417 --> 03:53:02.718]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:53:02.718 --> 03:53:08.300]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:53:08.300 --> 03:53:13.322]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:53:13.322 --> 03:53:13.802]  It's true.
[03:53:13.802 --> 03:53:18.904]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:53:18.904 --> 03:53:23.586]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:53:24.127 --> 03:53:31.231]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:53:31.231 --> 03:53:32.351]  And here's the best part.
[03:53:32.351 --> 03:53:39.035]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:53:39.035 --> 03:53:42.237]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:53:42.237 --> 03:53:45.378]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:53:49.020 --> 03:53:51.986]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:53:51.986 --> 03:53:58.097]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:53:58.097 --> 03:54:00.482]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:54:06.348 --> 03:54:10.614]  So this is the adventure you had in the land of the free, home of the brave, traveling wherever you want.
[03:54:10.614 --> 03:54:15.261]  You know, the Soviets always talked about how they wanted to move here, be able to travel and fly and drive.
[03:54:15.261 --> 03:54:16.402]  Not anymore.
[03:54:16.402 --> 03:54:17.644]  Not after 9-11.
[03:54:17.644 --> 03:54:18.505]  Everything changed.
[03:54:18.505 --> 03:54:19.326]  Homeland Security.
[03:54:19.326 --> 03:54:20.949]  We get the Homeland Security documents.
[03:54:20.949 --> 03:54:21.890]  It's all for us.
[03:54:22.691 --> 03:54:27.393]  And now they're going around all the businesses saying, spy on everybody, spy on your neighbors.
[03:54:27.393 --> 03:54:28.654]  Everyone's a gun owner.
[03:54:28.654 --> 03:54:30.295]  John Elway says, do you own gold?
[03:54:30.295 --> 03:54:31.335]  Do you have guns in your house?
[03:54:31.335 --> 03:54:32.736]  Call the police on your neighbor.
[03:54:32.736 --> 03:54:33.896]  That means they're a terrorist.
[03:54:33.896 --> 03:54:35.297]  We have the video.
[03:54:35.297 --> 03:54:39.299]  This is, these are sick, sick control freaks and their toadies.
[03:54:39.299 --> 03:54:41.820]  Finishing up though with Canada and a little bit more on Detroit.
[03:54:41.820 --> 03:54:47.943]  Let's keep rolling those images of Detroit later on in the reel, so we don't double over anything.
[03:54:47.943 --> 03:54:51.845]  Finish up with, you said she was saying, if your papers aren't in order, continue.
[03:54:52.318 --> 03:55:02.169]  Yeah, she was preparing to set us up to pay their customs fee on the approximate value of the cameras unless we could prove exactly where and when we bought them, by serial number.
[03:55:02.169 --> 03:55:04.671]  We were told if we didn't... Was this the US or the Canadians?
[03:55:04.671 --> 03:55:11.338]  This was the Canadians telling us we weren't going to get back into the US unless we could prove we bought our cameras in the US and not in Canada.
[03:55:12.884 --> 03:55:17.407]  Which is, you know, you buy electronics online now, that's where the best price is.
[03:55:17.407 --> 03:55:21.430]  So it was their people doing this, and before you left, they made the point about the camera.
[03:55:21.430 --> 03:55:27.495]  Yeah, and then coming back into America, they checked our papers, they asked about the cameras, did you buy them in Canada?
[03:55:27.495 --> 03:55:28.256]  No.
[03:55:28.256 --> 03:55:34.140]  Luckily the guy believed us, he seemed friendly, seemed like he... Oh, he wasn't too nice, he just put you in a gas chamber.
[03:55:34.140 --> 03:55:38.603]  Yeah, he just inspected our car and opened up everything, but he believed our story.
[03:55:38.603 --> 03:55:40.445]  Because his bosses carried out the attacks.
[03:55:40.445 --> 03:55:40.605]  Yeah.
[03:55:41.676 --> 03:55:42.617]  It's the global government.
[03:55:42.617 --> 03:55:44.459]  They all are for the same people.
[03:55:44.459 --> 03:55:45.400]  Another interesting thing.
[03:55:45.400 --> 03:55:46.921]  What did they say when the faxes came in?
[03:55:46.921 --> 03:55:49.384]  Did they deny those were real or anything?
[03:55:49.384 --> 03:56:00.956]  Well, we got the faxes in between while we were in Canada, but yeah, you know, last time we came through Buffalo, they detained us and didn't believe our story and made us prove various things about our paperwork and our rental car.
[03:56:00.956 --> 03:56:03.559]  Oh, he even asked us when we were coming back in, he goes, what were you doing in Buffalo?
[03:56:04.676 --> 03:56:08.759]  Yeah, so it's all in the database, of course.
[03:56:08.759 --> 03:56:14.343]  They had everything on, because we were the same, too, that went in through Buffalo last time, so they had that on record.
[03:56:14.343 --> 03:56:15.424]  They don't want you moving!
[03:56:15.424 --> 03:56:16.004]  They admit that.
[03:56:16.004 --> 03:56:17.685]  Everybody locked down.
[03:56:17.685 --> 03:56:18.866]  Major towns in the U.S.
[03:56:18.866 --> 03:56:20.187]  don't even let you out during the day.
[03:56:20.187 --> 03:56:24.030]  In Arkansas and Oklahoma, they want to check you when you drive down the street.
[03:56:24.030 --> 03:56:24.890]  CNN.
[03:56:24.890 --> 03:56:26.011]  And CNN says, that's good!
[03:56:26.011 --> 03:56:28.573]  You need to show your papers to walk in America.
[03:56:28.573 --> 03:56:33.016]  It's just amazing that it's harder to get back into the country that you're a citizen of than it is to leave
[03:56:33.656 --> 03:56:41.561]  But listen, when we flew into Canada that time and they detained us for 16 hours, foreigners and illegals were just, if it was a foreigner, they just bowed to them.
[03:56:41.561 --> 03:56:44.463]  But if it was a North American, we were scum.
[03:56:44.463 --> 03:56:47.565]  And I watched American businessmen and Canadian businessmen being treated like crap.
[03:56:47.565 --> 03:56:48.826]  Yeah, they wouldn't know how to get their cut.
[03:56:50.121 --> 03:56:51.082]  Customs cut.
[03:56:51.082 --> 03:56:55.824]  And whatever's being sold or done or... Well, Canadians are good people, but they have a scumbag government.
[03:56:55.824 --> 03:56:58.706]  And because the Canadians have been asleep at the switch, just like we have.
[03:56:58.706 --> 03:57:00.287]  Now, finish up with Detroit.
[03:57:00.287 --> 03:57:01.508]  I mean, what was this like?
[03:57:01.508 --> 03:57:07.931]  I mean, you could see, it's... it looks like it's bombed out half the locations we went to.
[03:57:07.931 --> 03:57:09.712]  It just looks like a war zone.
[03:57:09.712 --> 03:57:11.513]  And this is right in downtown.
[03:57:11.513 --> 03:57:12.754]  They're doing this stuff everywhere.
[03:57:12.754 --> 03:57:13.835]  Did you have a chance to go to Flint?
[03:57:14.295 --> 03:57:14.895]  Yes, we did.
[03:57:14.895 --> 03:57:18.657]  Yeah, we had about an hour to get into Flint, and we drove around there, and it looks just as bad.
[03:57:18.657 --> 03:57:21.198]  And they bulldozed 1,100 homes there.
[03:57:21.198 --> 03:57:22.479]  They're planning to bulldoze 3,000 more.
[03:57:22.479 --> 03:57:24.179]  Here they are, bulldozing.
[03:57:24.179 --> 03:57:28.101]  This bulldozer pulling up what used to be a perfectly good foundation.
[03:57:28.101 --> 03:57:30.262]  And this is deindustrialization.
[03:57:30.262 --> 03:57:32.283]  This is what The Globalist wrote about.
[03:57:32.283 --> 03:57:35.244]  We have Info of the Republic, you cover all of this.
[03:57:35.244 --> 03:57:36.785]  Mari Strong's quote.
[03:57:36.785 --> 03:57:40.807]  Here I have the Rockefellers, Dr. Richard Day of Planned Parenthood.
[03:57:44.383 --> 03:57:45.969]  We'll be interconnected.
[03:57:45.969 --> 03:57:46.993]  And that's what they're doing.
[03:57:46.993 --> 03:57:49.221]  The Packard plant closed starting in the 60s.
[03:57:49.221 --> 03:57:49.784]  We were in there.
[03:57:50.948 --> 03:57:53.749]  And now they're finishing off the job with the current bailout.
[03:57:53.749 --> 03:57:54.849]  And put that all in a file.
[03:57:54.849 --> 03:57:59.290]  I want this in the film, because this one's really going to be about the deindustrialization and the eugenics.
[03:57:59.290 --> 03:58:02.831]  Yeah, each part of the world will have a specialty and become interdependent.
[03:58:02.831 --> 03:58:03.311]  The U.S.
[03:58:03.311 --> 03:58:10.093]  will remain a center for agriculture, high-tech, communications, education, but heavy industry would be transported out.
[03:58:10.093 --> 03:58:13.034]  That's 1969, and it's happened now.
[03:58:13.034 --> 03:58:14.854]  And we know the bankers set up the crises.
[03:58:14.854 --> 03:58:17.015]  And then we get the documents how they're going to take our kids.
[03:58:17.015 --> 03:58:17.995]  Did you see in England?
[03:58:18.655 --> 03:58:19.595]  You are listening to GCN.
