[00:00:04.818 --> 00:00:06.138]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:07.899]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:09.659]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.239]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:12.799]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.980]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.301]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:33.143]  About a week and a half ago, I saw a YouTube video that had about 2,000 views, and Cal Muller
[00:00:34.813 --> 00:00:38.174]  Eric Mancow Muller being waterboarded.
[00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:43.897]  And I emailed it to Curt Nemo and I said, that is going to be a big story.
[00:00:43.897 --> 00:00:53.220]  And sure enough, millions of views on YouTube alone, all over MSNBC, CNN, Fox, you name it, for the last week.
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.682]  And we've been bumbling about getting him on, but we finally just talked to him.
[00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.823]  We've been playing phone tag the last few days.
[00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:02.023]  He is coming up during the next break.
[00:01:02.023 --> 00:01:03.164]  Why is this important?
[00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:09.448]  Because I knew what the response of the media and the neocons would be.
[00:01:09.448 --> 00:01:12.350]  They came out and said it was fake!
[00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.876]  Because when they called Mankow's publicist for the company he works for, Talk Radio Network, they said, oh, it was just a radio stunt.
[00:01:19.876 --> 00:01:29.683]  But nevertheless, the waterboarding was real, because the Chicago police, being control freaks, said, you can't do a waterboarding if it's real, and they said, don't worry, it's a stunt.
[00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:36.808]  By the way, if somebody consents to having water poured down their nose, they're allowed to do that.
[00:01:36.808 --> 00:01:39.830]  So that's just the police, as usual, out of control.
[00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.733]  But they've now said it's a conspiracy theory, it's not torture.
[00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:51.559]  You see, Mancow had been supporting torture, and then going further and saying that this wasn't torture.
[00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:56.286]  Though it's one of the most effective tortures, it brings on a panic attack.
[00:01:56.286 --> 00:02:06.189]  And as bad as it is in a controlled, air-conditioned environment with your friends around you laughing, he gave up in six seconds, the average person at about 15.
[00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.051]  Imagine having somebody jump on your stomach with their knee, like Jesse Ventura talked about in SEAL training.
[00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:16.008]  In the BUDS training, escape and evasion training.
[00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:31.797]  And imagine being locked up for three days, hanging by your wrist in a metal shed or a bamboo hut with mosquitoes biting you, with guys jabbing you with AK-47s and knocking your teeth out before they do it.
[00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:35.680]  And it's just done as a form of humiliation and control and to get fake data.
[00:02:36.536 --> 00:02:43.920]  And all the evil North Koreans, the evil Cambodians, the evil Russians, the Soviets, they would torture people.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.442]  But when we do it, it's good.
[00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:50.104]  It's good old-fashioned America.
[00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:51.425]  So that is coming up.
[00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:59.649]  We're going to have our once-a-month visit that we have here on air with Mike Rivera.
[00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:00.370]  What really happened?
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.081]  Also, we'll be covering all the news.
[00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:09.603]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and some new things we posted at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:03:09.603 --> 00:03:12.724]  Then we have an hour break in there.
[00:03:12.724 --> 00:03:15.025]  An hour break in there in the third hour.
[00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:25.628]  I am going to exclusively do nothing in the third hour but cover the cashless society control grid.
[00:03:25.628 --> 00:03:30.130]  And I tried writing notes last night and printing articles backing this up and the problem is there's too much evidence.
[00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:43.007]  And yes, they admit they're getting your front door GPS coordinates for drones that'll be deployed and are being deployed all over the United States to come gun you down at your front door.
[00:03:43.007 --> 00:03:43.848]  That's in the news.
[00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.493]  Microsoft's new Xbox is coming out with a camera that face scans you to log on.
[00:03:51.493 --> 00:03:59.777]  Dare and McGruff and the Feds are going around to all the public schools and daycares, not even asking the parents, and trying to take DNA samples.
[00:03:59.777 --> 00:04:03.619]  I mean, you got the baby's blood at birth illegally.
[00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:08.061]  All American slaves for 36 years have had their blood taken illegally.
[00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:13.884]  But that isn't enough, and they're getting biometric finger scans of every finger for the grid.
[00:04:15.086 --> 00:04:16.166]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:18.267]  It's just a very important third hour today.
[00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:20.688]  And then, he hasn't been on this in a few months.
[00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:24.289]  Always has a lot of data and info and a great intellect.
[00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:30.612]  Webster Griffin Tarpley, in the last hour today, joins us from the suburbs of Washington, D.C.
[00:04:30.612 --> 00:04:35.293]  to break down what's really happened with General Motors and a lot more.
[00:04:35.293 --> 00:04:37.814]  A totally jam-packed transmission today.
[00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:39.795]  I am Alex Jones.
[00:04:39.795 --> 00:04:41.836]  This is the Last Ditch Effort.
[00:04:43.044 --> 00:04:46.405]  against the global technocracy, the slave grid.
[00:04:46.405 --> 00:04:50.827]  The insertion into the matrix is now taking place.
[00:04:50.827 --> 00:04:54.429]  Do you want to be inserted into a physical matrix?
[00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:55.589]  It's coming up!
[00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:56.670]  Stay with us!
[00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:05.461]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:09.485]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:15.391]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:20.456]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:24.460]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.802]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:05:26.802 --> 00:05:29.804]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[00:05:43.095 --> 00:05:44.636]  A long time sponsor of ours.
[00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:49.339]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:51.120]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.681]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[00:05:57.043 --> 00:05:58.464]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:06:06.864 --> 00:06:09.945]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:09.945 --> 00:06:12.767]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:12.767 --> 00:06:15.548]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:15.548 --> 00:06:18.749]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:26.073]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:34.537]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:34.537 --> 00:06:38.398]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.958]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.139]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:42.919]  They're not after money.
[00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.199]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.179]  They're after power.
[00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:46.319]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:54.641]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:06:57.822 --> 00:06:58.922]  You have been warned.
[00:06:59.978 --> 00:07:04.500]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.602]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:09.602 --> 00:07:11.123]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:11.123 --> 00:07:14.725]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:07:37.414 --> 00:07:39.315]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[00:08:06.571 --> 00:08:08.353]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.353 --> 00:08:10.114]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:11.696]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.696 --> 00:08:13.257]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.257 --> 00:08:17.441]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:19.783]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:29.812]  Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.812 --> 00:08:34.235]  Eric Mancow Muller, Seneca Radio Talk Show host.
[00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:35.336]  Sally.
[00:08:35.336 --> 00:08:37.498]  That's right, it's Sally.
[00:08:37.498 --> 00:08:39.279]  We decided to start calling him Sally.
[00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:41.861]  You know, uh, I like when you spank me and call me Sally.
[00:08:44.045 --> 00:08:45.207]  Man, you are something else.
[00:08:45.207 --> 00:08:47.129]  I was saying, should I call you Eric Mancow Muller?
[00:08:47.129 --> 00:08:48.651]  And you said, call me whatever I want.
[00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:50.013]  I said, OK, I'll call you Sally.
[00:08:50.013 --> 00:08:52.136]  And now your new name will be Sally.
[00:08:52.136 --> 00:08:52.937]  Whatever.
[00:08:52.937 --> 00:08:54.760]  How are you, Alex?
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.762]  I was about to say something really horrible.
[00:08:56.762 --> 00:08:57.523]  You troublemaker.
[00:08:58.424 --> 00:09:01.285]  You know what, I saw this early last week and I said that's going to be big.
[00:09:01.285 --> 00:09:15.928]  We had a few thousand views on YouTube, now it's millions all over international television, and now you supposedly are a Che Guevara hardcore communist, according to the controlled right wing, even though you actually support torturing people still.
[00:09:15.928 --> 00:09:17.349]  You just admit it's torture.
[00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:20.870]  You're now bad because you dare admit it's torture.
[00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.971]  Alex, my friend, you've done it.
[00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:25.671]  You've done it again.
[00:09:26.681 --> 00:09:30.649]  Look, this is a lose-lose situation for me.
[00:09:30.649 --> 00:09:33.895]  I was convinced that water sprinkled on the face was not torture.
[00:09:33.895 --> 00:09:35.318]  The right loved me.
[00:09:36.297 --> 00:09:39.039]  The left continued to loathe me.
[00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:40.941]  I am not a Republican.
[00:09:40.941 --> 00:09:42.662]  I am not a dummy crap.
[00:09:42.662 --> 00:09:43.483]  I am a libertarian.
[00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:45.605]  No, the stupid people in this country don't know what that is.
[00:09:45.605 --> 00:09:48.888]  They hear libertarian and think, oh liberal, you must like Obama.
[00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:52.050]  No, I want the government to leave me and my family alone.
[00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.313]  I want to be able to drink raw milk that isn't controlled by the government.
[00:09:55.313 --> 00:09:56.474]  I want school choice.
[00:09:56.474 --> 00:10:00.658]  I want these sorts of things.
[00:10:00.658 --> 00:10:04.561]  And what happened here is I set out to prove that it wasn't torture.
[00:10:05.786 --> 00:10:10.991]  And I came to believe, after I was waterboarded live on my silly little radio show, that it was torture.
[00:10:10.991 --> 00:10:14.114]  And what happened is, you have to understand, look, Pelosi knew.
[00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.715]  The dummy craps knew.
[00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:16.716]  The Republicans knew.
[00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:17.477]  Everybody knew.
[00:10:17.477 --> 00:10:18.678]  So it's not left and right.
[00:10:18.678 --> 00:10:20.600]  That's the game they play.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.540]  I'm left, I'm right.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.602]  You don't listen to the puppets.
[00:10:23.602 --> 00:10:25.364]  But who is the Geppetto here?
[00:10:25.364 --> 00:10:28.947]  It's the corporate-run country.
[00:10:28.947 --> 00:10:32.050]  So, they have a vested interest in this never being decided.
[00:10:32.734 --> 00:10:38.597]  So when Fox and MSNBC and CNN and others came out and said, wow, this is torture.
[00:10:38.597 --> 00:10:40.638]  They want it to be kind of a non-issue.
[00:10:40.638 --> 00:10:44.460]  Now, I also said this is a bigger issue than me.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.440]  I cannot make the decision on this.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.062]  You know, I'm an imperfect individual.
[00:10:49.062 --> 00:10:53.744]  I don't believe that our brave, proud people in the military did this for their jollies.
[00:10:53.744 --> 00:10:55.785]  I think they did it to save American lives.
[00:10:55.785 --> 00:10:59.487]  Would I pour water down somebody's nose to save my child?
[00:10:59.487 --> 00:10:59.707]  Yes.
[00:10:59.707 --> 00:11:02.308]  And I would do the same for your child, Alex, or any of your listeners.
[00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:08.083]  So, you know, I'm in a really ugly position here, Fred.
[00:11:08.083 --> 00:11:12.187]  But that's the issue, is you're seeing what the neocon establishment is doing.
[00:11:12.187 --> 00:11:17.491]  You go on air and you say, I still support this, but it is torture, and that isn't enough for them.
[00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:24.077]  They want us to play the mental mind game of saying, no, this doesn't cause a panic attack, no, this doesn't simulate drowning.
[00:11:24.597 --> 00:11:26.038]  And I had Jesse Ventura on yesterday.
[00:11:26.038 --> 00:11:37.726]  He pointed out that, you know, in the escape and evasion training in the Navy, they also jump on your stomach with their knee while they pour the water down your nose.
[00:11:37.726 --> 00:11:41.989]  And they've got to have medics there on top of it because this would really hurt people.
[00:11:41.989 --> 00:11:49.274]  I think Dick Cheney and Nancy Pelosi and other people that have been saying this isn't torture, how about they get waterboarded?
[00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:50.355]  I mean, volunteer for it.
[00:11:50.967 --> 00:11:55.190]  Well, listen, I want to say something about what you just said.
[00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.373]  There is a lie that is going around, okay, and that is that it's drowning.
[00:11:59.373 --> 00:12:02.715]  Now, I talk about in my book, as a kid I drowned and I had to be brought back to life.
[00:12:02.715 --> 00:12:05.317]  It simulates drowning, is what I said.
[00:12:05.317 --> 00:12:07.178]  But Alex, it doesn't.
[00:12:07.178 --> 00:12:08.039]  It doesn't.
[00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:10.641]  I've been whitewater rafting, even in your area.
[00:12:10.641 --> 00:12:12.302]  You're an outdoorsman, I know.
[00:12:12.302 --> 00:12:13.543]  This isn't gulping for air.
[00:12:13.543 --> 00:12:15.004]  This isn't like drowning in a pool.
[00:12:15.004 --> 00:12:15.844]  This isn't like that.
[00:12:15.844 --> 00:12:17.485]  This is worse.
[00:12:17.485 --> 00:12:19.547]  And to your listeners... Oh, really?
[00:12:19.983 --> 00:12:24.027]  To your listeners who say, as I did, you could hold your breath.
[00:12:24.027 --> 00:12:33.095]  This goes into your sinuses, fills up the back of your skull with water, it cuts off all oxygen to your brain, and it's instantaneous.
[00:12:33.095 --> 00:12:36.438]  I had severe chest pains.
[00:12:36.438 --> 00:12:37.398]  I went into this laughing.
[00:12:37.398 --> 00:12:39.700]  The smartass that I am, I thought it was no big deal.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.402]  Let me just say something else.
[00:12:41.402 --> 00:12:46.907]  Immediately, these bloggers, and I believe many of them, are fronts for government agencies.
[00:12:47.888 --> 00:12:49.789]  Uh, you know, they lie.
[00:12:49.789 --> 00:12:50.469]  Let me stop you.
[00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:57.532]  That's declassified that tens of millions are spent by both parties a year in fake news and fake blogs.
[00:12:57.532 --> 00:12:57.792]  Right.
[00:12:57.792 --> 00:13:00.213]  So you can't find who they are.
[00:13:00.213 --> 00:13:01.114]  You can't sue them.
[00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:02.190]  You can't.
[00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.872]  So all these lies went out that I had perpetrated about.
[00:13:04.872 --> 00:13:06.752]  Now look, I have a silly little radio show.
[00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:12.075]  I wasn't trying to say that when, you know, when I got waterboarded, it was exactly what happened at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:15.737]  So people would say things like, well, was it a licensed torturer?
[00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:17.238]  No, no, it was not.
[00:13:17.238 --> 00:13:19.659]  Uh, did you have chains around you?
[00:13:19.659 --> 00:13:20.059]  Uh, no.
[00:13:20.802 --> 00:13:25.143]  Here's what it was, and this is not the Khmer Rouge method or anything else.
[00:13:25.143 --> 00:13:26.284]  This is the CIA.
[00:13:26.284 --> 00:13:31.185]  Your legs have to be up, you're elevated, your head back, and water is poured in your nose and in your mouth.
[00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:32.406]  That's it.
[00:13:32.406 --> 00:13:37.027]  And so for them to try to discredit me, I wasn't trying to do it exactly like at Guantanamo.
[00:13:37.027 --> 00:13:39.608]  I was trying to prove that it was not torture.
[00:13:39.608 --> 00:13:41.669]  I don't understand how they think I would fake it.
[00:13:43.346 --> 00:13:51.388]  But the Army Field Manual since the 1960s says it's one of the most effective forms of torture, so there's never been a debate.
[00:13:51.388 --> 00:13:57.209]  They just continue with an ignorant public to tell them that it's a fun thing to happen and it's no big deal.
[00:13:57.209 --> 00:14:00.590]  And I've talked to people that have been waterboarded, they said it totally.
[00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.690]  It just elicits the panic response.
[00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.651]  Is that what happened with you?
[00:14:04.651 --> 00:14:07.271]  Alex, it was horrific and it was instantaneous.
[00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:11.632]  And again, I went in like a punk, laughing.
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.742]  And I thought I could hold my breath for 30 seconds to a minute.
[00:14:15.742 --> 00:14:16.243]  Game over.
[00:14:16.243 --> 00:14:17.424]  It's not torture.
[00:14:17.424 --> 00:14:20.626]  And I want to tell you, it was good night, Irene.
[00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:24.109]  It felt like my brain had been short-circuited.
[00:14:24.109 --> 00:14:28.132]  I was up at night on my knees praying to God, please, I have two little daughters.
[00:14:28.132 --> 00:14:28.952]  I just want to live.
[00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:31.094]  I was having chest pains.
[00:14:31.094 --> 00:14:32.915]  It messed with my body.
[00:14:32.915 --> 00:14:33.836]  Describe what it did.
[00:14:33.836 --> 00:14:35.037]  Describe the process.
[00:14:35.037 --> 00:14:36.118]  Well, I mean, it's...
[00:14:38.192 --> 00:14:44.816]  Uh, it is, um, I'm laying back, my legs are up, my legs were bound, my hands were bound.
[00:14:44.816 --> 00:14:56.002]  Uh, they started to pour the water, you can see it on the internet, but they started to pour the water, and I'm thinking, okay, and it went right into my nose and shut down my brain, and man, I wanted this to end.
[00:14:56.002 --> 00:15:01.466]  Now, I'm a little bit embarrassed, uh, they were saying eight seconds, it may actually have been short of eight seconds.
[00:15:01.466 --> 00:15:03.847]  Uh, it was, it was something I wanted to stop.
[00:15:03.847 --> 00:15:05.628]  Look, that's why we use it, and again,
[00:15:06.294 --> 00:15:08.156]  Three people were waterboarded?
[00:15:08.156 --> 00:15:11.799]  If we picked up somebody off of the battlefield and we could save lives?
[00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:15.362]  I think it's a bigger issue than what I can address.
[00:15:15.362 --> 00:15:15.842]  I really do.
[00:15:15.842 --> 00:15:18.244]  I think it's too big of an issue for me, Alex.
[00:15:18.244 --> 00:15:19.045]  Should we do it?
[00:15:19.045 --> 00:15:21.087]  Look, if it's going to save American lives, I don't know.
[00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:27.052]  I also want to tell you, I'm sure you already know, about the Manchester documents.
[00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:32.437]  Manchester documents found in Manchester, England, where some of my favorite music comes out of.
[00:15:32.437 --> 00:15:33.978]  And it was the Al-Qaeda playbook.
[00:15:34.685 --> 00:15:38.319]  And they basically say no matter what, claim torture.
[00:15:38.982 --> 00:15:43.265]  So, you know, you give them too much Cap'n Crunch at Guantanamo, they claim torture.
[00:15:43.265 --> 00:15:44.666]  They claim torture for everything.
[00:15:44.666 --> 00:15:52.812]  So, I wanted to prove this was just another thing they claim torture about, the ACLU and League with them, everything else, and I was going to prove that it wasn't torture.
[00:15:52.812 --> 00:16:02.299]  Well, man, Cal Mueller, syndicated radio host who did, last week, made major headlines throughout this week for those that just joined us having waterboarded and coming out and saying, yes, it's torture.
[00:16:02.299 --> 00:16:04.401]  Look, this is, and you know why they're attacking you.
[00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:19.210]  It's because you have supported the view that it's not torture, and supported, go ahead and use harsh interrogation to quote, you know, win the war and save the military lives, but that's why this has been so damning to them.
[00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:23.413]  Obviously, now you're seeing the disingenuousness and the deceptiveness
[00:16:24.593 --> 00:16:49.723]  of these people as they're coming out and now trying to discredit you and saying you're a liar, all because when separately the PR firm at Talk Radio Network, you know, totally separate in the company, and I know how this stuff works, they, you know, the police show up saying you can't waterboards, they say don't worry, it's just a hoax, and then now they're trying to spin that and use that, but I mean that's asinine.
[00:16:49.723 --> 00:16:53.344]  It's on video, they poured the water down your nose, the army admits it's torture.
[00:16:53.824 --> 00:16:55.845]  But Alex, that's not exactly what happened.
[00:16:55.845 --> 00:17:09.713]  Look, the network that syndicates my show, the police here in my city, the company that runs my home-based station, building management, my insurance company, everybody.
[00:17:09.713 --> 00:17:13.475]  You know, we talked about it for a few days, and look, I understand.
[00:17:13.475 --> 00:17:16.076]  I can't allow an employee to waterboard.
[00:17:16.076 --> 00:17:17.697]  You could die.
[00:17:17.697 --> 00:17:19.818]  I'm not going to allow one of my employees to waterboard.
[00:17:19.818 --> 00:17:20.459]  Would you, Alex?
[00:17:21.192 --> 00:17:22.653]  Hey, I've already decided, man.
[00:17:22.653 --> 00:17:24.034]  I'll announce it now.
[00:17:24.034 --> 00:17:28.418]  I'm going to get an actual, somebody trained in it, and I'm going to be waterboarded.
[00:17:28.418 --> 00:17:31.800]  I'm going to do it, and I'm going to see if I can hold out 30 seconds.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.763]  Well, you know, I hope you can, and maybe you'll do a different version than I did.
[00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.264]  I'm going to get the full deal.
[00:17:37.264 --> 00:17:39.886]  I'm going to have them stick my head completely.
[00:17:39.886 --> 00:17:42.629]  See, that's a field waterboarding that you got.
[00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:44.290]  The hardcore type.
[00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.971]  Have you seen Conspiracy Theory with Mel Gibson?
[00:17:45.971 --> 00:17:47.813]  They put him on a stretcher and stick his head in the water.
[00:17:47.813 --> 00:17:48.973]  That was about you.
[00:17:48.973 --> 00:17:49.894]  That's the real deal.
[00:17:49.894 --> 00:17:50.995]  That movie was about you, wasn't it?
[00:17:52.046 --> 00:17:58.387]  No, but the Woody Harrelson character in the 2012 movie, I've talked to him, is me, but go ahead.
[00:17:58.387 --> 00:18:00.208]  Alright, well, whatever.
[00:18:00.208 --> 00:18:04.929]  We had to tell people that, yeah, we're not really going to do it, because we didn't want to get shut down.
[00:18:04.929 --> 00:18:05.789]  I understand.
[00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:13.751]  The fact is, we did it, and it is horrific, but should we use it to save lives?
[00:18:13.751 --> 00:18:15.071]  Alex, it's a tough one.
[00:18:15.071 --> 00:18:15.571]  What do you think?
[00:18:17.216 --> 00:18:22.641]  Well, I know that now that if our troops get captured, foreign governments can torture them and say it's okay.
[00:18:22.641 --> 00:18:24.483]  And I know that our founders figured out it was bad.
[00:18:24.483 --> 00:18:25.284]  The British did it.
[00:18:25.284 --> 00:18:27.746]  Our forefathers didn't.
[00:18:27.746 --> 00:18:30.869]  They spoke out against it and said that they want to take the high road.
[00:18:30.869 --> 00:18:37.755]  And torture gets you fake evidence, like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed saying he bombed buildings that were built three years after he was arrested.
[00:18:38.896 --> 00:18:41.679]  And I think it's a very, very slippery slope.
[00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:53.848]  And certainly there's been some people exaggerating and using it for political purposes, but on the other hand, the media hasn't really reported on the Army's own report, General Taguma's report, about raping children in front of their parents.
[00:18:53.848 --> 00:18:54.969]  Oh, dear God.
[00:18:54.969 --> 00:19:00.874]  And so I'm against it, because we lose our soul once we start down this road, man.
[00:19:00.874 --> 00:19:01.955]  You may be right.
[00:19:01.955 --> 00:19:05.918]  You also do know that, look, they did get good information as well out of waterboarding.
[00:19:07.335 --> 00:19:08.615]  They did get some good information.
[00:19:08.615 --> 00:19:11.456]  But look, this is not a question for me.
[00:19:11.456 --> 00:19:13.337]  Honestly, it's too heavy of an issue for me.
[00:19:13.337 --> 00:19:19.258]  You know, I thought about doing waterboarding six months ago to show how it's torture, but it wouldn't be as effective if I did it.
[00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:21.479]  The fact that you didn't think it was torture was more effective.
[00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:22.219]  I guess.
[00:19:22.219 --> 00:19:22.719]  I guess.
[00:19:22.719 --> 00:19:35.002]  Look, here's what I did learn, and it's kind of what I've known for a long time, is I looked behind the curtain of Oz, and I've got a chance to see what's happening.
[00:19:37.489 --> 00:19:39.070]  What's happening is the music, Mankow.
[00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.591]  I know you're doing two radio shows a day now.
[00:19:41.591 --> 00:19:45.693]  Let me talk to you during the break, see if you can hold over five more minutes.
[00:19:45.693 --> 00:19:47.875]  If not, we'll let you get back to all the important work you're doing.
[00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:50.376]  But you missed the most important thing of all!
[00:19:50.376 --> 00:19:51.056]  Stay there!
[00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:52.137]  Stay there!
[00:19:52.137 --> 00:19:55.218]  There is Mankow Muller planting the hook for us.
[00:19:55.218 --> 00:19:56.639]  And we'll give you his website when we get back.
[00:19:56.639 --> 00:19:57.600]  Ours is InfoWars.com.
[00:20:00.413 --> 00:20:02.755]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[00:20:02.755 --> 00:20:12.262]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[00:20:12.262 --> 00:20:20.287]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:26.212]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[00:20:27.312 --> 00:20:29.654]  506-5904.
[00:20:29.654 --> 00:20:34.716]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[00:20:34.716 --> 00:20:39.599]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:48.684]  American Tax Settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back, and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[00:20:48.684 --> 00:20:52.767]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800
[00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:06.575]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:06.575 --> 00:21:13.599]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:14.142 --> 00:21:20.748]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:20.748 --> 00:21:22.729]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:22.729 --> 00:21:25.211]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:36.801]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:36.801 --> 00:21:38.482]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.482 --> 00:21:40.324]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:40.324 --> 00:21:42.906]  This film documents who Obama works for.
[00:21:43.484 --> 00:21:47.226]  The lies he has told and his real agenda.
[00:21:47.226 --> 00:21:55.490]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.071]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.071 --> 00:21:58.252]  The people strike back.
[00:22:00.071 --> 00:22:00.751]  You worry.
[00:22:00.751 --> 00:22:03.113]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:03.653]  Hi.
[00:22:03.653 --> 00:22:06.435]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:22:06.435 --> 00:22:10.977]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:22:10.977 --> 00:22:13.459]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:22:13.459 --> 00:22:16.801]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:22:16.801 --> 00:22:18.742]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[00:22:18.742 --> 00:22:21.523]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[00:22:21.523 --> 00:22:25.246]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[00:22:25.246 --> 00:22:29.288]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:33.750]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:40.073]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[00:22:40.073 --> 00:22:42.434]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[00:22:42.434 --> 00:22:44.555]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[00:22:44.555 --> 00:22:49.217]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:22:49.217 --> 00:22:50.117]  Start now.
[00:22:50.117 --> 00:22:51.838]  Knowledge is power.
[00:22:51.838 --> 00:22:52.839]  Better take action.
[00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:53.799]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:23:00.037 --> 00:23:01.798]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:03.439]  June 2nd, 2009.
[00:23:03.439 --> 00:23:05.340]  Gold opened this morning at $9.8210.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.081]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1,099.50495 for the half-ounce and $252.48 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:23:09.081 --> 00:23:09.341]  That's $109.9050495 and $252.48.
[00:23:17.165 --> 00:23:21.168]  Bailout equals market distortions, increased money supply while productivity is going down.
[00:23:21.168 --> 00:23:25.431]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[00:23:25.431 --> 00:23:30.135]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share, paying fat dividends.
[00:23:30.135 --> 00:23:35.759]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:39.061]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[00:23:39.061 --> 00:23:43.905]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust, or is it time to ensure your hard-earned wealth?
[00:23:44.025 --> 00:23:49.446]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[00:23:49.446 --> 00:23:53.907]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems, or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[00:23:53.907 --> 00:23:54.787]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:54.787 --> 00:23:55.507]  Eric Mankow Muller.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:19.463]  He's now had the dirty deeds done to him by the establishment media.
[00:24:19.463 --> 00:24:24.266]  Coming out and saying he's a liar, it's not torture that he staged all of that.
[00:24:24.266 --> 00:24:28.808]  Clearly you can see that either he's an Academy Award actor or it was certainly upsetting.
[00:24:28.808 --> 00:24:33.090]  You can see the water being poured down his nose by a strapping Marine.
[00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.272]  Then they go, well he's not a professional torturer.
[00:24:35.272 --> 00:24:37.413]  I mean it's very simple.
[00:24:37.413 --> 00:24:41.575]  You went off what the CIA says, this is the way you do it.
[00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:43.656]  Yeah, I love this.
[00:24:43.656 --> 00:24:47.219]  You know, and it is a right-wing thing, and I'm a libertarian.
[00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:49.880]  Left or right, you can keep it.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.721]  It is interesting.
[00:24:50.721 --> 00:24:53.723]  Look, my dad was the mayor of Lakers, New Jersey.
[00:24:53.723 --> 00:24:55.484]  This is where the Hindenburg went down.
[00:24:55.484 --> 00:24:57.165]  Which political party would he belong to?
[00:24:57.165 --> 00:25:06.231]  I wonder if some of these liberals, if they ever actually read anything that their hero wrote or said, I'm talking about JFK, they would be considered crazy nowadays.
[00:25:07.704 --> 00:25:12.150]  Really, this nation has turned into one big party.
[00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.813]  As I said, everybody says left or right, but they're all the same.
[00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:16.615]  The powers that be.
[00:25:16.615 --> 00:25:19.939]  And so it's really amazing, this Oz-like curtain of Washington.
[00:25:19.939 --> 00:25:22.102]  Before we went to break, I was talking about this.
[00:25:22.102 --> 00:25:25.807]  I've seen behind the curtain, folks, and let me assure you, they all suck.
[00:25:26.485 --> 00:25:29.788]  To pick a side is like picking between ass or lung cancer.
[00:25:29.788 --> 00:25:30.288]  Okay?
[00:25:30.288 --> 00:25:32.089]  So you can vote any way you want, it doesn't matter.
[00:25:32.089 --> 00:25:40.376]  They want your money and they want more and more crippling regulations that keep in the driver's seat the whole time they talk about how, you know, they're doing it for your children.
[00:25:40.376 --> 00:25:42.978]  Uh, they take your freedoms as they're doing it for your children.
[00:25:42.978 --> 00:25:44.579]  So, here I am in Obama-land.
[00:25:44.579 --> 00:25:45.780]  I'm in Chicago.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.642]  I've watched this movie, surrounded by low-lifes.
[00:25:48.642 --> 00:25:53.946]  So we talk his way to the White House, and I can't believe that people believe that Obama, like Christ,
[00:25:54.486 --> 00:25:59.249]  Walked across the cesspool of corrupt, windy city politics into the most powerful office in the world.
[00:25:59.249 --> 00:26:00.810]  I mean, people need to grow up.
[00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.751]  So here I did this waterboarding.
[00:26:02.751 --> 00:26:05.493]  I upset at the political applecart in America.
[00:26:05.493 --> 00:26:09.175]  It may be career suicide, because I dared to ask questions.
[00:26:09.175 --> 00:26:12.697]  Look, I wanted to prove that it was not torture.
[00:26:12.697 --> 00:26:15.639]  And I discovered, to my surprise, that it was torture.
[00:26:16.167 --> 00:26:18.048]  So instantly everyone hated me.
[00:26:18.048 --> 00:26:19.649]  Democrat and Republican alike.
[00:26:19.649 --> 00:26:20.189]  Right?
[00:26:20.189 --> 00:26:23.371]  The bleeding heart liberals thought it was some conservative trick.
[00:26:23.371 --> 00:26:25.212]  And we were laughing at the Republicans.
[00:26:25.212 --> 00:26:26.213]  Felt they were betrayed.
[00:26:27.031 --> 00:26:32.334]  The fact is... And that's because the Democrats are so deeply involved in it that they all have to cover it up.
[00:26:32.334 --> 00:26:33.014]  Pelosi knew!
[00:26:33.014 --> 00:26:33.794]  Pelosi knew!
[00:26:33.794 --> 00:26:40.277]  I'm waiting for someone with a sandwich board to walk up and down the streets of Washington and have it say Pelosi knew.
[00:26:40.277 --> 00:26:41.118]  That's exactly right.
[00:26:41.118 --> 00:26:43.699]  Look, the Bush regime, everybody signed off on it.
[00:26:43.699 --> 00:26:44.339]  Pelosi knew.
[00:26:44.339 --> 00:26:45.860]  The dummy craps knew.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.102]  So it is cover your ass season right now in Washington, D.C.
[00:26:49.102 --> 00:26:51.123]  Yes, this shatters the left-right paradigm.
[00:26:51.963 --> 00:27:13.193]  Man, Cal, in closing, I want you to fire up your website and we're folks in here to show, but what's incredible is we knew a year ago he was going to set up youth brigades and red and black uniforms, but now the military ads with them doing military marches are on TV, and now they've introduced bills to totally ban entire classes of firearms, they've introduced the Cyber Bullying Act, they've got Hannah Montana in character.
[00:27:13.533 --> 00:27:15.494]  Pushing, arresting someone.
[00:27:15.494 --> 00:27:18.095]  I mean, this makes the hate crime stuff pale in comparison.
[00:27:18.095 --> 00:27:22.157]  I mean, this is even amazing me how fast it's moving.
[00:27:22.157 --> 00:27:23.737]  Mankal Muller, your comments on that.
[00:27:23.737 --> 00:27:25.238]  What is going on?
[00:27:25.238 --> 00:27:26.759]  Too many things to comment on.
[00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:30.320]  My website, you don't, it's mankal.com if you must know.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:35.462]  Alex, I'll tell you, look, free speech, we must protect unique voices.
[00:27:35.462 --> 00:27:36.403]  Not the lemmings.
[00:27:36.403 --> 00:27:37.603]  Land of the free, land of the free.
[00:27:37.603 --> 00:27:39.004]  I say we are land of the lemmings.
[00:27:39.504 --> 00:27:45.694]  Running off the cliff, and I love that we have unique voices like Alex Jones, and Alex, you're one of the most unique out there.
[00:27:52.483 --> 00:27:53.744]  Well, you're one of the most unique as well, man.
[00:27:53.744 --> 00:27:54.505]  Cal, thank you.
[00:27:54.505 --> 00:28:00.331]  Where is all this going with them denying and challenging you and saying it isn't torture?
[00:28:00.331 --> 00:28:03.354]  Well, here's the problem, okay?
[00:28:03.354 --> 00:28:05.757]  I mean, look, there are a lot of stupid people out there.
[00:28:05.757 --> 00:28:06.358]  You don't believe me?
[00:28:06.358 --> 00:28:07.078]  Go for a walk.
[00:28:07.078 --> 00:28:07.919]  Go for a drive.
[00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:08.640]  You'll be amazed.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.282]  Everybody's stupid but you.
[00:28:10.282 --> 00:28:12.724]  Everybody seems to be living in their own movie, right?
[00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:14.786]  It's all about me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[00:28:15.547 --> 00:28:18.408]  Every city has streets named after people one way.
[00:28:18.408 --> 00:28:20.708]  Everybody's got their little, uh, you know, iPods on.
[00:28:20.708 --> 00:28:22.729]  They're walking in the traffic, not paying attention.
[00:28:22.729 --> 00:28:24.790]  But not everybody's a moron, Alex.
[00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:25.690]  Not everybody's stupid.
[00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:29.931]  There are a lot of smart people and all they have to do is see that video.
[00:28:29.931 --> 00:28:36.473]  So when the government has their phony baloney bloggers coming up trying to destroy me, they cannot have it out there.
[00:28:36.473 --> 00:28:38.113]  They must protect the status quo.
[00:28:38.113 --> 00:28:39.734]  They must remain in power.
[00:28:39.734 --> 00:28:41.334]  They're in it together.
[00:28:41.334 --> 00:28:42.854]  And stop buying into it.
[00:28:42.854 --> 00:28:44.435]  Just stop playing the games, folks.
[00:28:44.855 --> 00:28:45.696]  Forget it!
[00:28:45.696 --> 00:28:48.699]  Left, right, they're the same!
[00:28:48.699 --> 00:28:49.359]  Absolutely.
[00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:55.885]  Well, I mean, the whole House of Cards falls as soon as people realize that Obama whining and complaining about torture.
[00:28:55.885 --> 00:28:58.508]  That's why they're putting cameras everywhere.
[00:28:58.508 --> 00:28:59.929]  They're ready for us to revolt.
[00:28:59.929 --> 00:29:03.292]  Hey, every stoplight in Chicago, I just got a Cobra.
[00:29:03.292 --> 00:29:09.498]  I went to Cobra.com, okay, and I got a red light camera detector so that I can see when the government's watching me.
[00:29:10.436 --> 00:29:14.819]  You think they're putting up all these cameras because they're concerned about people running red lights?
[00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:19.923]  No, they're getting ready because they know this facade is about to crumble.
[00:29:19.923 --> 00:29:21.544]  They keep saying we've reached the bottom.
[00:29:21.544 --> 00:29:23.466]  We haven't reached the bottom, folks.
[00:29:23.466 --> 00:29:25.007]  The greatest depression is coming.
[00:29:27.483 --> 00:29:29.645]  All right, Mankal, we'll talk to you soon.
[00:29:29.645 --> 00:29:31.106]  Appreciate you coming on the show.
[00:29:31.106 --> 00:29:32.247]  All right, brother.
[00:29:32.247 --> 00:29:32.747]  Take care.
[00:29:32.747 --> 00:29:34.228]  There goes Mankal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:34.228 --> 00:29:38.712]  All right, I'll come back, tell you all the news that's coming up and the guest today.
[00:29:38.712 --> 00:29:39.512]  Keep it locked in.
[00:29:39.512 --> 00:29:41.574]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:41.574 --> 00:29:49.280]  Our websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net, InfoWars.com, TruthNews.us, JonesReport.com, ObamaDeception.net.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.042]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.042 --> 00:29:52.443]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.443 --> 00:29:53.944]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.947 --> 00:30:00.370]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.071]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.071 --> 00:30:04.633]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[00:30:12.827 --> 00:30:18.892]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:30:18.892 --> 00:30:22.134]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:30:22.134 --> 00:30:29.140]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.402]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:30:32.402 --> 00:30:33.323]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:33.323 --> 00:30:37.566]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:37.566 --> 00:30:42.790]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, dehydrated food
[00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.093]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:13.220]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:19.722]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.722 --> 00:31:21.702]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.702 --> 00:31:24.163]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:24.163 --> 00:31:35.045]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.333 --> 00:31:39.015]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.015 --> 00:31:40.876]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:40.876 --> 00:31:47.783]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.783 --> 00:31:56.050]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:57.632]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.632 --> 00:31:58.813]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.316 --> 00:32:04.840]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.402]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:32:07.402 --> 00:32:16.869]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:32:16.869 --> 00:32:17.469]  We're good to go.
[00:32:36.022 --> 00:32:36.543]  Let's do this!
[00:33:14.768 --> 00:33:15.888]  Again!
[00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:52.642]  Coming straight on for the New World Order.
[00:33:52.642 --> 00:33:55.243]  Straight on.
[00:33:55.243 --> 00:33:57.164]  Got Mike Rivera for an hour joining us.
[00:33:57.164 --> 00:34:01.226]  We'll open the phones up.
[00:34:01.226 --> 00:34:01.426]  At 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:01.426 --> 00:34:02.706]  1-800-259-9231 gets you up and on the air.
[00:34:19.452 --> 00:34:23.994]  And then we've got Webster Tarbley in the last hour.
[00:34:23.994 --> 00:34:34.938]  In the third hour, I'm going to break down the Cashless Society control grid and how it ties in to the cyber security bill.
[00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:43.855]  That will end free speech, as we know it, track everything you purchase, everything you buy, everything you sell, everything you do.
[00:34:43.855 --> 00:34:45.176]  How it ties into the D.A.R.E.
[00:34:45.176 --> 00:34:54.141]  program, to McGruff the Crime Dog, to the face scanning cameras, to the biometrics, to the RFIDs, the control grid.
[00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:58.223]  That is coming up.
[00:34:58.223 --> 00:35:02.186]  Before I go to some of your phone calls,
[00:35:06.445 --> 00:35:13.688]  Let me go ahead and break down the news that we will expand on throughout this transmission.
[00:35:13.688 --> 00:35:16.089]  I could only get Mankow on at the start of the show.
[00:35:16.089 --> 00:35:20.611]  We've been playing phone tag again for a week with him.
[00:35:20.611 --> 00:35:22.972]  And so that's why we did the first 20 minutes or so with him.
[00:35:22.972 --> 00:35:24.093]  That is now completed.
[00:35:24.093 --> 00:35:29.415]  We'll normally start the show with a guest, but when we have to, we have to.
[00:35:29.415 --> 00:35:33.077]  By the way, Gerald Cilente is coming up later in the week, Alan Watt, Ron Paul next week.
[00:35:36.087 --> 00:35:48.794]  I'm noticing a lot of other shining stars in the Congress as well who are really fighting the New World Order and have many of the same positions as we do under the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, Liberty.
[00:35:48.794 --> 00:35:52.496]  And I want to start getting some of those other Congressmen and women on so you'll be hearing more of those in the future.
[00:35:52.496 --> 00:35:54.157]  That's an initiative we're launching.
[00:35:54.157 --> 00:36:03.583]  I also want to give a report sometime this week on the good things that are happening
[00:36:04.554 --> 00:36:13.500]  The successes were happening and the solutions so we can expand these successes that we've already had.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.202]  Okay, let me just read the headlines themselves.
[00:36:18.202 --> 00:36:19.303]  You know I can never do this.
[00:36:19.303 --> 00:36:23.186]  I always go back and comment on them and then never get into the stack, but I'm going to do it right now.
[00:36:23.186 --> 00:36:25.227]  This is the type of news I have in my stack.
[00:36:25.227 --> 00:36:29.129]  Poll finds Irish support for EU Lisbon Treaty rises.
[00:36:29.129 --> 00:36:30.070]  They did that last time.
[00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:31.931]  It's a complete and total lie.
[00:36:31.931 --> 00:36:33.272]  They said last time it was going to pass.
[00:36:34.244 --> 00:36:35.104]  That's from Reuters.
[00:36:35.104 --> 00:36:37.945]  You see, I can't just read the headlines.
[00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:40.466]  The Great Carbon Credit Con.
[00:36:40.466 --> 00:36:43.927]  Why are we paying the third world to poison its environment?
[00:36:43.927 --> 00:36:45.247]  Daily Mail.
[00:36:45.247 --> 00:36:47.148]  Well, you've hit on the plan!
[00:36:47.148 --> 00:36:55.991]  All the toxic waste, with no restrictions, is in the third world, which will actually hurt the environment, which the eugenicists in the Royal Commission documents admit they want to do!
[00:36:55.991 --> 00:36:56.831]  Ha ha ha!
[00:36:56.831 --> 00:37:03.813]  Who would ever imagine the actual environmental chiefs are eugenicists that know the Earth is incredibly hard to kill and just want to poison off humanity?
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.321]  Hmm.
[00:37:06.321 --> 00:37:09.924]  Spy chips guiding CIA drone strikes, locals say.
[00:37:09.924 --> 00:37:15.349]  This is out of wired.com.
[00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:18.151]  Confirmed, what we already knew years ago.
[00:37:18.151 --> 00:37:22.015]  They come and GPS people's front doors or throw RFID into the house.
[00:37:25.672 --> 00:37:28.233]  And then the cruise missile shoots into the person's house.
[00:37:28.233 --> 00:37:33.974]  They get $150 per house, and they admit they just go put them in innocent people's houses to get the money.
[00:37:33.974 --> 00:37:34.874]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:37:34.874 --> 00:37:54.799]  And just like they get $25,000 per head in Afghanistan for totally innocent 14-year-old goat herders who have no connection to Taliban or Al-Qaeda, because they're all CIA, and they take them to the camps to be tortured to death, and then people come on the air here and make excuses and say everything's fine when the Army's own report admits it.
[00:37:55.697 --> 00:37:56.978]  So there you have it.
[00:37:56.978 --> 00:38:03.063]  And they, by the way, are marking your doors for the Feds, for NORTHCOM, for Homeland Security, with drones as well.
[00:38:03.063 --> 00:38:04.865]  And that's now admitted on the news.
[00:38:04.865 --> 00:38:06.186]  That's coming up.
[00:38:06.186 --> 00:38:10.169]  Oh yes, just send a drone right to your house to kill you dead or in a hammer.
[00:38:10.169 --> 00:38:12.671]  And it'll face scan you first to make sure it's you.
[00:38:12.671 --> 00:38:16.634]  That's why they take digital photos of all your kids in the public schools.
[00:38:16.634 --> 00:38:23.560]  They have computer programs to morph the development of your child so they can later, even if they don't get a face scan later, can kill you dead or in a hammer.
[00:38:25.444 --> 00:38:28.025]  New security restrictions at border.
[00:38:28.025 --> 00:38:34.388]  They are now starting to thumbprint you when you come in and out of the U.S., but Mexican illegal aliens are exempt.
[00:38:34.388 --> 00:38:35.749]  That's actually in the news.
[00:38:35.749 --> 00:38:44.513]  And when you leave the U.S., you get face scanned and thumbprinted when you go into other countries, part of a global agreement.
[00:38:44.513 --> 00:38:47.134]  Background TV can harm children's speech.
[00:38:48.444 --> 00:38:52.545]  Another big government study reported on by the Daily Mail.
[00:38:52.545 --> 00:39:12.693]  Not only does watching television cause massive degeneration in the brain and early onset of different brain disorders like ALS and Alzheimer's, but a new study shows that it destroys speech and conversation in the home and causes the destruction of the
[00:39:15.578 --> 00:39:20.081]  Vocabulary and stunts the development of the vocabulary.
[00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:22.964]  Tennessee speeders could get fingerprinted.
[00:39:22.964 --> 00:39:24.204]  I keep meaning to get to this.
[00:39:24.204 --> 00:39:28.708]  This is kind of in the stack of news I haven't covered dealing with casual society control grit.
[00:39:28.708 --> 00:39:30.369]  Of course, this is just out of Tennessee.
[00:39:30.369 --> 00:39:35.473]  Everywhere, everyone, when you get stopped, whether you're ticketed or not, will be biometrically enrolled.
[00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:37.334]  They're training you to do this.
[00:39:37.334 --> 00:39:40.897]  And when you buy and sell, you'll have to do it.
[00:39:40.897 --> 00:39:42.398]  Or total control.
[00:39:42.398 --> 00:39:44.540]  And it will be a serious felony if you don't
[00:39:47.008 --> 00:39:57.251]  Thumbscan when you mow somebody's yard or you get a haircut, ending the cashless, the cash society, putting us into the cashless society.
[00:39:57.251 --> 00:40:00.832]  Housing bailout bill creates national fingerprint registry.
[00:40:00.832 --> 00:40:08.055]  All over the nation, CPAs, carpenters, school teachers,
[00:40:09.025 --> 00:40:21.231]  Realtors, every profession, doctors, lawyers, you're criminals and have to biometrically be scanned in, bringing federal control over your profession.
[00:40:21.231 --> 00:40:24.333]  And I'm giving you kind of a prelude of the control grid coming up.
[00:40:24.333 --> 00:40:28.415]  Fingerprinting program threatens privacy for CPAs, accountants.
[00:40:28.415 --> 00:40:33.598]  Homeland Security to scan fingerprints of travelers exiting the U.S.
[00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:35.119]  U.S.
[00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:37.060]  tries exiting tracking system.
[00:40:38.473 --> 00:40:41.415]  Army starts testing Judge Dredd weapon, Fox News.
[00:40:41.415 --> 00:40:43.196]  Bullets that shoot around corners.
[00:40:43.196 --> 00:40:44.637]  Bullets that scan your face.
[00:40:44.637 --> 00:40:47.820]  They have your digital photo in them.
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:51.282]  An exploding missile flies up and blows your head off.
[00:40:51.282 --> 00:41:01.149]  All part of the new freedom, but they want our little tinker toy guns so they can route us properly with all the right-headed foreigners they've hired to be troops.
[00:41:01.149 --> 00:41:02.350]  Sweat equals threat.
[00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:06.313]  Army looks at abnormal perspiration as sign of harmful intent.
[00:41:09.861 --> 00:41:12.203]  That's right, with the whole smart grid.
[00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:14.204]  It says the Army will be running all U.S.
[00:41:14.204 --> 00:41:14.704]  airports.
[00:41:14.704 --> 00:41:17.546]  It's out of wired news.
[00:41:17.546 --> 00:41:22.630]  They'll be running all the major airports, as they already are, and if they see you sweating, they'll take you away for questioning.
[00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.791]  Why did your husband get taken away?
[00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:30.395]  Well, he was sweating and they beat him to death, but you know we've got to support the officers.
[00:41:30.395 --> 00:41:31.976]  It's so good to have the U.S.
[00:41:31.976 --> 00:41:35.058]  military used against the American people.
[00:41:35.058 --> 00:41:36.119]  Where's your brother go?
[00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:38.320]  Oh, he got taken away for re-education.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:38.941]  He was sweating.
[00:41:41.636 --> 00:41:45.978]  They have face scanners that decide if you're frowning or upset.
[00:41:45.978 --> 00:41:48.619]  That's a sign you're with Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:48.619 --> 00:41:52.980]  Of course, all the real fundings for gun owners, conservatives, veterans.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:53.981]  You are the target!
[00:41:53.981 --> 00:41:59.543]  Those of you that are helping enforce this will find that out soon enough, but too late, of course, for you.
[00:41:59.543 --> 00:42:06.946]  Bankers lobbied secretly to keep derivatives under Federal Reserve oversight and away from real scrutiny and secret.
[00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:11.551]  Aaron Dykes points out the obvious, but it's finally in the mainstream news.
[00:42:11.551 --> 00:42:19.552]  Stuff we put in the Obama Deception, but Aaron did a great report up at InfoWars.com that everybody should see.
[00:42:19.552 --> 00:42:36.755]  Just a child with a temper is what they're saying about the policeman who on video in New York, in Yonkers, beat this woman half to death, breaking her jaw, blacking both her eyes, bruises all over her body, slamming her head repeatedly in the concrete, pools of blood, for no reason!
[00:42:37.876 --> 00:42:41.317]  And he's been found not guilty and they say this is good.
[00:42:41.317 --> 00:42:50.838]  And there's all these videos coming out of cops running up to suspects who have their hands spread out eagle and kicking them savagely hard enough to kill them.
[00:42:50.838 --> 00:42:57.119]  Heads flying back, blood spewing, and the police come on the news and laugh and say, we call this adjusting their head.
[00:42:57.119 --> 00:42:59.100]  And then they even laugh on TV.
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.401]  It's funny that you've been given the green light to go absolutely wild.
[00:43:03.401 --> 00:43:05.401]  I heard local news defending the police
[00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:20.105]  Shooting two black men in the back, asleep in a car, and then the police keep saying on the news, we thought he was reaching for a gun, and the news comes out and says he had a gun.
[00:43:20.105 --> 00:43:22.426]  You go read the police report, there was no gun.
[00:43:22.426 --> 00:43:23.667]  They don't care!
[00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.948]  They put it out on the news that he had a gun.
[00:43:25.948 --> 00:43:30.391]  Again, it's the same news that tells you it's the law to take vaccines when it's not.
[00:43:30.391 --> 00:43:32.512]  It's all about deception, all about lying.
[00:43:33.652 --> 00:43:38.376]  So the talking point out in Austin is a federal lawsuit's been filed, goes like this.
[00:43:38.376 --> 00:43:44.402]  Oh, this bad family suing over the fact their son was shot in the back and killed in cold blood.
[00:43:44.402 --> 00:43:46.484]  That's going to cost taxpayers money.
[00:43:46.484 --> 00:43:50.568]  No, having mad dog, out of control cops is going to cost us money.
[00:43:52.281 --> 00:43:53.722]  That's what's going to cost us money.
[00:43:53.722 --> 00:43:56.083]  So see, oh, we're with the police.
[00:43:56.083 --> 00:43:57.484]  Poor things.
[00:43:57.484 --> 00:43:58.384]  Oh, there's a suit.
[00:43:58.384 --> 00:44:03.107]  And they were literally demonizing the family on two different talk stations I tuned into, driving into work.
[00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:05.468]  It was unbelievable.
[00:44:05.468 --> 00:44:10.490]  And then they went on to say, oh, well, this guy had been arrested before for drugs.
[00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:13.192]  And so the callers were saying, good, kill him.
[00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:17.254]  Oh, the CIA ships the drugs in openly, caught routinely.
[00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:19.315]  The big banks openly launder the money.
[00:44:19.315 --> 00:44:20.776]  But that's OK.
[00:44:22.725 --> 00:44:28.727]  But if anybody's ever had an arrest for drugs, he had an arrest, not a conviction, kill him!
[00:44:28.727 --> 00:44:31.027]  And I've heard people say, you shouldn't be out at night.
[00:44:31.027 --> 00:44:32.568]  Kill him!
[00:44:32.568 --> 00:44:35.489]  Kill, kill everybody!
[00:44:35.489 --> 00:44:38.330]  This is the attitude.
[00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.250]  This is the attitude.
[00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:49.493]  Now, when your son or daughter gets killed by the police, it won't be so funny, but see, you'll have the local news and the media and the police lobby out there telling you it's a great thing.
[00:44:53.590 --> 00:45:01.455]  And it goes on and on, and of course the squad car videos malfunctioned.
[00:45:01.455 --> 00:45:10.901]  Just like they said the, uh, subway train video malfunctioned out in Oakland.
[00:45:10.901 --> 00:45:16.264]  And then witnesses said no, that he was in handcuffs, they shot the guy in the back.
[00:45:16.264 --> 00:45:20.767]  And the police said, the public's lying, they're nothing but liars.
[00:45:20.767 --> 00:45:22.928]  We've done nothing wrong, everything's fine.
[00:45:28.223 --> 00:45:32.606]  And this went on and on for a while.
[00:45:32.606 --> 00:45:39.892]  Then they said, oh, the surveillance cameras in the subway system, the train station, they malfunctioned.
[00:45:39.892 --> 00:45:48.398]  They weren't working, kind of like 7-7 and Madrid and every other terror attack, and the Pentagon.
[00:45:48.398 --> 00:45:54.463]  And the Fed seizing all the cameras from 9-11 in lower Manhattan.
[00:45:54.463 --> 00:45:56.144]  And in Austin, you know, they shoot you in the back.
[00:45:56.144 --> 00:45:57.365]  Oh, the cameras weren't on.
[00:46:01.593 --> 00:46:09.178]  And then it turned out with that case in California, the police lied!
[00:46:09.178 --> 00:46:10.459]  Oh my goodness!
[00:46:10.459 --> 00:46:11.900]  Because a train was driving by.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:16.083]  And what does the train video pick up?
[00:46:16.083 --> 00:46:17.463]  The train on the other platform.
[00:46:17.463 --> 00:46:22.147]  The police didn't think to stop that train and go in and confiscate all the cell phone videos.
[00:46:22.147 --> 00:46:25.729]  Several people shot the entire thing.
[00:46:25.729 --> 00:46:28.150]  You have police run up and say, lay down.
[00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:34.213]  And these young men who came back from a fireworks display lay down.
[00:46:34.213 --> 00:46:36.135]  Somebody called in a fist fight on a train.
[00:46:36.135 --> 00:46:38.316]  Turned out these were not the guys.
[00:46:38.316 --> 00:46:41.918]  But they're black, so you know, the news was kind of like, ah, go ahead and kill them.
[00:46:41.918 --> 00:46:45.041]  You know, because everybody knows all blacks are criminals, according to the media.
[00:46:45.041 --> 00:46:47.262]  And so they lay down.
[00:46:47.262 --> 00:46:54.047]  Then they put this one guy in handcuffs, and he's kind of, look, you know, leaning up off his chest, saying, come on, man.
[00:46:54.047 --> 00:46:55.928]  Don't just shove my head in the ground.
[00:46:56.988 --> 00:47:21.528]  And then they put him in handcuffs, and then the cop just pulls his gun out, shoots him in the back, bullet goes through him, bounces off the concrete, back up into his chest, and the police then go around slamming his head in the ground and roughing him up, kind of having a little victory assault that they just killed him, and the guy was obviously feeding off of this and getting off, so they slam him down on the ground some more, and then go around grabbing everybody's cell phone cameras to cover up the murder.
[00:47:21.528 --> 00:47:25.131]  And then the train pulls off.
[00:47:25.131 --> 00:47:25.912]  And that's all we see.
[00:47:29.369 --> 00:47:33.592]  And we got the police reports now at Oklahoma, and we got the local witness reports.
[00:47:33.592 --> 00:47:34.313]  They all match.
[00:47:34.313 --> 00:47:40.077]  People that were coming out of businesses and saw the whole altercation.
[00:47:40.077 --> 00:47:45.382]  The police in Oklahoma just pull over an ambulance with a woman who's collapsed of heat exhaustion, complaining thought it was a heart attack.
[00:47:46.562 --> 00:47:52.045]  And they run up and start pushing the EMT that gets out, and the guy's going, what's going on here?
[00:47:52.045 --> 00:47:55.486]  The cops are screaming, you should have got out of my way, and he's like, I couldn't.
[00:47:55.486 --> 00:47:57.787]  There was traffic in front of him, the cops on a power trip.
[00:47:57.787 --> 00:48:01.409]  Turns out he's gone after ambulances not once, but twice.
[00:48:01.409 --> 00:48:03.570]  Last time with a pregnant woman in the back.
[00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:06.031]  He just doesn't like the fact that the ambulances don't get out of his way.
[00:48:06.031 --> 00:48:07.832]  It's a God complex.
[00:48:07.832 --> 00:48:10.633]  His daddy's the local judge and all that, you know, classic story.
[00:48:12.325 --> 00:48:15.529]  And, uh, so the other AMT says, well, I guess I'll help this lady.
[00:48:15.529 --> 00:48:18.273]  So he's in the back helping her and the cops run up and say, do not help her.
[00:48:18.273 --> 00:48:18.973]  You're under arrest.
[00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:22.752]  And the EMT looks at him like he's crazy and he says, what are you talking about?
[00:48:22.752 --> 00:48:24.453]  This is an ambulance!
[00:48:24.453 --> 00:48:27.075]  And the cop starts shoving him and he's like, hey man!
[00:48:27.075 --> 00:48:28.416]  The EMT says, what's your problem?
[00:48:28.416 --> 00:48:29.577]  It's all on video.
[00:48:29.577 --> 00:48:30.658]  We've played it here.
[00:48:30.658 --> 00:48:31.358]  What's your problem?
[00:48:31.358 --> 00:48:32.399]  I'm in, this is an ambulance!
[00:48:32.399 --> 00:48:33.240]  He's sick!
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.361]  I'm gonna help her.
[00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:38.724]  So the cop grabs him by the arm, tries to pull it behind his back to torture him.
[00:48:38.724 --> 00:48:40.966]  And the EMT pulls his hand back.
[00:48:40.966 --> 00:48:41.906]  Well, that's the assault.
[00:48:41.906 --> 00:48:44.408]  That's why they say they're gonna go ahead and charge the EMT.
[00:48:44.408 --> 00:48:46.770]  He pulls his hand back from the mad dog and lunatic.
[00:48:48.291 --> 00:48:51.493]  See, now the ambulances have got to, you know, maybe be shot.
[00:48:51.493 --> 00:48:53.015]  See, next it'll be gunning them down.
[00:48:53.015 --> 00:48:56.677]  It'll be, well, they need to die, oh, and they shot the patient too.
[00:48:56.677 --> 00:48:57.338]  They deserve it.
[00:48:57.338 --> 00:48:59.780]  You know, this is how we do it to keep you safe.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.801]  This is mental illness.
[00:49:00.801 --> 00:49:01.801]  This is tyranny.
[00:49:01.801 --> 00:49:03.923]  It always happens.
[00:49:03.923 --> 00:49:05.244]  The power goes to their head.
[00:49:05.244 --> 00:49:10.528]  So then the cops start choking the EMT, and the EMT figures out, boy, they're about to kill me.
[00:49:10.528 --> 00:49:17.413]  So he totally controls himself, lets them choking, and is saying, you're choking me.
[00:49:17.413 --> 00:49:17.994]  You're choking me.
[00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:20.313]  You're choking me.
[00:49:20.313 --> 00:49:21.201]  And then finally the cops...
[00:49:22.501 --> 00:49:33.984]  Settle down, look like reality comes to them, and they start patting the son who was following the ambulance on the back, saying, the son's like, will you just please let my mother go to the hospital?
[00:49:33.984 --> 00:49:40.245]  And the cops kind of notice how crazy they are, and they go, okay, let's go to the hospital, and they take him to the hospital and don't arrest anybody.
[00:49:40.245 --> 00:49:42.566]  But then the higher-ups say, look, we've got to charge people.
[00:49:42.566 --> 00:49:44.186]  We've got to cover this up, Bubba.
[00:49:44.186 --> 00:49:45.487]  You did it again.
[00:49:45.487 --> 00:49:47.347]  What's your thing with ambulances?
[00:49:47.347 --> 00:49:49.988]  You know that's happening at the state police office, going, oh,
[00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:56.351]  And look out, he saw an ambulance like a bird dog seeing a bird or a rabbit.
[00:49:56.351 --> 00:50:05.196]  This is like the dogs at the dog track with the electronic rabbit that's released that they chase.
[00:50:05.196 --> 00:50:13.380]  But the issue is, this guy wasn't off the force the last two times he pulled over ambulances with their lights on, and he's going to keep doing it.
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:17.823]  And he's going to keep doing it, and the police are going to go on TV and say it's normal.
[00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:23.832]  Because the system wants to defend their minions.
[00:50:23.832 --> 00:50:29.134]  And they want them to know, no matter what you do in this coming tyranny, you're going to be backed up.
[00:50:29.134 --> 00:50:34.917]  And so, the police are going to become universally hated.
[00:50:34.917 --> 00:50:37.719]  And the good cops are going to leave, and it's going to get worse and worse.
[00:50:37.719 --> 00:50:41.741]  We'll take some phone calls when we get back, tell you about some of the other news.
[00:50:41.741 --> 00:50:43.642]  China suspends North Korean exchanges.
[00:50:45.492 --> 00:50:49.094]  Top Democrats come out and say banks openly run the country.
[00:50:49.094 --> 00:50:52.755]  Carter breaks with Obama, says probe Bush officials.
[00:50:52.755 --> 00:50:57.517]  Give you the latest GM data, how they're moving to China and other countries.
[00:50:57.517 --> 00:50:58.878]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.245 --> 00:51:03.726]  Recognize that sound?
[00:51:03.726 --> 00:51:08.508]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[00:51:08.508 --> 00:51:10.968]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:51:10.968 --> 00:51:16.291]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:51:16.291 --> 00:51:21.693]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[00:51:21.693 --> 00:51:25.134]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[00:51:25.134 --> 00:51:27.235]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[00:52:02.055 --> 00:52:07.417]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.

[00:53:54.226 --> 00:53:55.627]  Back in April, someone reported
[00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:14.878]  Top Senate Democrat.
[00:54:14.878 --> 00:54:16.519]  Bankers own the U.S.
[00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:21.684]  and Congress.
[00:54:21.684 --> 00:54:25.186]  And that was said by Senator Dick Durbin on local Chicago radio.
[00:54:25.186 --> 00:54:29.130]  We played that clip here on air.
[00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:37.316]  Now another member of the Congress has gone public.
[00:54:37.316 --> 00:54:38.878]  Headline, Banks run Congress.
[00:54:38.878 --> 00:54:42.421]  Top Democrat says this is out of raw story.
[00:54:43.803 --> 00:54:54.195]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to deduce that the banking and financial services industry has an outsized influence in Congress.
[00:54:54.195 --> 00:55:01.244]  Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase each got bailouts of $25 billion in government bailouts last year.
[00:55:03.035 --> 00:55:14.341]  Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs got $10 billion apiece, and AIG, the mammoth insurer that lost billions in bad derivatives debts, had sucked in more than $170 billion.
[00:55:14.341 --> 00:55:20.364]  Yeah, and then they paid that out to the before-mentioned banks and brokerage firms.
[00:55:20.364 --> 00:55:28.369]  Meanwhile, President Barack Obama is in a recent bailout speech in California.
[00:55:31.104 --> 00:55:35.967]  Colin Patterson, Democratic Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, says he knows who to blame.
[00:55:35.967 --> 00:55:42.071]  The banks run the place, Peterson told the New York Times in Monday's edition.
[00:55:42.071 --> 00:55:44.433]  I will tell you what the problem is.
[00:55:44.433 --> 00:55:47.555]  They give three times more money than the next biggest group.
[00:55:47.555 --> 00:55:49.796]  It's huge, the amount of money they put into politics.
[00:55:49.796 --> 00:55:51.437]  And he went on from there.
[00:55:51.437 --> 00:55:52.498]  And here's the problem.
[00:55:53.638 --> 00:55:56.601]  They will run around advertising that they own everything.
[00:55:56.601 --> 00:56:02.786]  They will lobby to pass laws to restrict political giving and write in loopholes where only they can give money.
[00:56:02.786 --> 00:56:04.807]  That's how these people operate.
[00:56:04.807 --> 00:56:15.476]  The big banks financed the campaign finance reform bill that doubled the amount of money that big corporations could give, but restricted what individual citizens could give.
[00:56:15.476 --> 00:56:17.438]  I mean, it never ends with these criminals.
[00:56:19.124 --> 00:56:21.025]  So I thought I'd cover that.
[00:56:21.025 --> 00:56:23.646]  More on the GM situation coming up.
[00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:26.147]  Right now, let's go ahead and start taking some of your phone calls.
[00:56:26.147 --> 00:56:27.707]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:56:27.707 --> 00:56:30.248]  Welcome.
[00:56:30.248 --> 00:56:31.008]  Hello?
[00:56:31.008 --> 00:56:32.449]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:32.449 --> 00:56:34.009]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:34.009 --> 00:56:35.990]  I have a story I wanted to tell you.
[00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:45.674]  I bought a book a while back called The Forsaken, and it was about the Stalin purges, all the Americans that went to work for the Ford Motor Company in Russia, and they got caught up in the purges.
[00:56:45.674 --> 00:56:45.934]  Yes.
[00:56:47.005 --> 00:57:11.030]  So anyway, in the book, they had a story told about Stalin and a secret policeman were in a room and they were laughing and laughing, and they said the reason they were laughing, they said Stalin had tears in his eyes, because the secret policeman was telling about one of the Communist Party officials that Stalin had arrested and had shot, and the guy was telling Stalin, mimicking how the guy was pleading for his life.
[00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:14.951]  And so anyway, it went on after that, that it said that
[00:57:16.343 --> 00:57:21.130]  After that storm, three weeks later, storm had that secret policeman arrested and shot too.
[00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:24.856]  And that's, you name the dictatorship, that's the kind of stuff that goes on.
[00:57:24.856 --> 00:57:26.258]  And that's where we're heading right now.
[00:57:26.258 --> 00:57:30.284]  Through all these cops up there, all these government officials, I think they're part of the program.
[00:57:30.284 --> 00:57:31.085]  Well, they better think again.
[00:57:32.751 --> 00:57:36.535]  Most of them are weak-minded and believe their own propaganda.
[00:57:36.535 --> 00:57:44.082]  But yes, these predatory systems statistically attack their own more often than they even go after those that are fighting them.
[00:57:44.082 --> 00:57:46.785]  And I refuse to live on my knees.
[00:57:46.785 --> 00:57:49.388]  I refuse to lick the boots of the government.
[00:57:49.388 --> 00:57:51.290]  I refuse to be a serf and a slave.
[00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:54.753]  I will not go along with the New World Order.
[00:57:54.753 --> 00:57:55.013]  Ever.
[00:57:55.013 --> 00:57:55.374]  Period.
[00:57:56.247 --> 00:57:59.870]  ...torture stuff is coming out as part of the breaking down process.
[00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:08.035]  They want to get people broken down so they can use torture here in the United States on people, and people will be shrugging their shoulders and say, well... No, no, no, no, no!
[00:58:08.035 --> 00:58:08.875]  It's worse than that.
[00:58:08.875 --> 00:58:12.418]  They call it pain compliance or pressure compliance.
[00:58:12.418 --> 00:58:15.199]  It's in the extras in my film, Martial Law.
[00:58:15.199 --> 00:58:24.685]  They break your arms, and federal judges say, if you're sitting in front of an abortion clinic, or protesting the cutting down of trees, they can break your arms.
[00:58:25.626 --> 00:58:27.267]  They can beat you with nunchucks.
[00:58:27.267 --> 00:58:29.009]  Of course, they're complete criminals.
[00:58:29.009 --> 00:58:30.770]  But, no, no, no, no.
[00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:31.551]  You're absolutely right.
[00:58:31.551 --> 00:58:36.075]  They are legitimizing... What do you think tasers are?
[00:58:36.075 --> 00:58:37.175]  These are cattle prods.
[00:58:37.175 --> 00:58:41.599]  We're in a slave grid.

[01:00:09.914 --> 01:00:11.515]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.515 --> 01:00:13.076]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:17.259]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.259 --> 01:00:21.321]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.558 --> 01:00:35.586]  We're going to start simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv in T-minus 7 minutes, 25 seconds.
[01:00:38.308 --> 01:00:44.072]  Mike Rivero will be joining us via video cam from Hawaii.
[01:00:44.072 --> 01:00:45.173]  Always look forward to those interviews.
[01:00:45.173 --> 01:00:48.775]  We'll have open phones throughout the hour, break down what's really happening with the economy.
[01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:52.598]  We are going into forced global receivership on record.
[01:00:52.598 --> 01:00:53.679]  We'll break all of that down.
[01:00:53.679 --> 01:00:57.562]  This is a criminal by design consolidation that's taking place.
[01:00:57.562 --> 01:00:59.183]  Webster Tarpley joins us in the last hour.
[01:00:59.183 --> 01:01:03.106]  I'm going to go over the cashless society control grid in the next hour.
[01:01:03.106 --> 01:01:07.409]  As promised, all the latest developments, how it ties into the whole cybersecurity takeover system.
[01:01:08.449 --> 01:01:11.632]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Leon in New York.
[01:01:11.632 --> 01:01:12.953]  Leon, you're on the air.
[01:01:12.953 --> 01:01:13.293]  Welcome.
[01:01:13.293 --> 01:01:15.114]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:01:15.114 --> 01:01:16.015]  Good, sir.
[01:01:16.015 --> 01:01:17.996]  You know, it's sad.
[01:01:17.996 --> 01:01:28.023]  I know it's nothing to laugh about, but when you mentioned the sweating as an indicator to point out suspicious people, I just couldn't have any other reaction.
[01:01:28.023 --> 01:01:31.005]  I mean, it stretches the limit of absurdity.
[01:01:32.008 --> 01:01:33.929]  Well, they actually said that seven years ago.
[01:01:33.929 --> 01:01:35.610]  It's just now they're enforcing it.
[01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:39.993]  The Army is putting out manuals on how to control Americans on the streets.
[01:01:39.993 --> 01:01:41.494]  This is Wired Magazine.
[01:01:41.494 --> 01:01:45.356]  And in the airports, the bus terminals, it's going nationwide.
[01:01:45.356 --> 01:01:47.498]  Airport security will be at malls everywhere.
[01:01:47.498 --> 01:01:49.919]  The FBI has announced that.
[01:01:49.919 --> 01:01:51.900]  In fact, I want to cover that in the Cashless Grid.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:53.501]  Will you guys Google so I have it?
[01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:55.022]  It's like from two years ago.
[01:01:55.022 --> 01:01:57.304]  FBI says airport security for malls.
[01:01:58.388 --> 01:02:04.731]  And so this is constantly being lined up, constantly showing your ID, constantly being in databases.
[01:02:04.731 --> 01:02:06.472]  Oh, Alex Jones is at the mall.
[01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:08.673]  The cameras show off his face scan.
[01:02:08.673 --> 01:02:10.374]  You know, he's a person of interest.
[01:02:10.374 --> 01:02:18.578]  I was wearing one of the Patriot shirts we wear, one of the ones we put out at Infowars.com, at the beach.
[01:02:18.578 --> 01:02:23.561]  The one that says, live free or die, and it's got a Minuteman on the front, and you would have thought
[01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:29.031]  As I walked down the beach, it was real crowded every morning I'd take a walk.
[01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:34.554]  You know, it was always cop types and military types with their with their wives walking.
[01:02:34.554 --> 01:02:38.137]  And they would, you know, the general public didn't know what it was.
[01:02:38.137 --> 01:02:41.179]  Some would say, hey, New Hampshire, or that sounds good.
[01:02:41.179 --> 01:02:47.943]  But you'd always see a high and tight haircut type, you know, cop type who reads the intelligence reports and thinks he's like Jack Bauer.
[01:02:47.943 --> 01:02:51.826]  You know, they would say, hey, and started looking at me and going, huh?
[01:02:51.826 --> 01:02:53.767]  And like, look at his shirt on.
[01:02:54.167 --> 01:02:55.188]  That's one of them people.
[01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:55.888]  That's one of them.
[01:02:55.888 --> 01:02:57.549]  One of them we gotta watch there.
[01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:59.090]  He's for freedom.
[01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:06.855]  But yeah, the reports say sweating, frowning, raising your voice, anything.
[01:03:06.855 --> 01:03:17.761]  Just having a road almanac in your car, a travel atlas, wearing blue jeans, having a cell phone, having a Libertarian sticker, a Ron Paul sticker.
[01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:19.302]  Everything is terrorism, sir.
[01:03:20.638 --> 01:03:27.682]  Well, no, they want paranoid, weak-minded people.
[01:03:27.682 --> 01:03:32.404]  I'll never forget, I was in the Austin Airport a few years ago, and the guy had a black-and-white covered book.
[01:03:32.404 --> 01:03:38.507]  I got a 1984, and it said, How Someone Becomes a Terrorist.
[01:03:38.507 --> 01:03:40.188]  And it wasn't about how to spot a terrorist.
[01:03:40.188 --> 01:03:42.209]  It was all about, everybody's a terrorist.
[01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:44.690]  Everybody, except the government, the bankers, they're good.
[01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:45.411]  I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
[01:03:46.075 --> 01:03:49.096]  Yeah, I had a question for you unrelated to what we were just talking about.
[01:03:49.096 --> 01:04:07.059]  You know, you had mentioned, or I've heard, that Tiny Tim was out there talking about, you know, there's a rebound happening and the dollar's safe and everything's great and peachy and wonderful, and I was wondering if you guys managed to dig up a clip of that particular event, because I couldn't find anything.
[01:04:07.059 --> 01:04:09.000]  By Tiny Tim, do you mean Geithner?
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:09.680]  Yeah, Geithner, yeah.
[01:04:10.666 --> 01:04:23.104]  Well, his lordship is telling us in Bloomberg and AP that China loves us and everything's fine with the dollar and GM is wonderful and everything's good, but no, I haven't seen the video clip of it, but I've seen the text of what he said.
[01:04:23.717 --> 01:04:26.059]  It was in the news that they laughed at him, actually.
[01:04:26.059 --> 01:04:29.621]  I was looking for a clip and I figured maybe you guys dug that up.
[01:04:29.621 --> 01:04:35.105]  Yeah, I did see in the text that the Chinese laughed at him, but that's what we're here for.
[01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:45.272]  I mean, it's a joke that offshore banks can rob and steal everything we've got, and our police just run around running checkpoints, frenzying and tasering old ladies and stopping ambulances.
[01:04:45.272 --> 01:04:48.214]  I've now got a report of them stopping an ambulance with a woman who died.
[01:04:48.914 --> 01:04:51.275]  I mean, I'm not even trying to make the police look bad.
[01:04:51.275 --> 01:04:57.618]  Believe me, if I wanted to, I could do a four-hour radio show end-to-end with examples of these people out of control.
[01:04:57.618 --> 01:04:58.259]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.259 --> 01:04:58.659]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:09.671]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:05:09.671 --> 01:05:14.835]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:05:14.835 --> 01:05:19.900]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals actually results in disease.

[01:06:14.267 --> 01:06:19.149]  And now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award.
[01:06:19.465 --> 01:06:19.986]  We're good to go.
[01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:42.531]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:44.994]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.

[01:07:22.159 --> 01:07:23.239]  True ammunition.
[01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:24.340]  How much do you want?
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.100]  When do you want it?
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.961]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:07:26.961 --> 01:07:27.981]  When will you need it?
[01:07:27.981 --> 01:07:30.562]  Will you buy it without proper identification?
[01:07:30.562 --> 01:07:32.083]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:07:32.083 --> 01:07:32.983]  Quarantine?
[01:07:32.983 --> 01:07:36.424]  Will you feed yourself or go to the gathering center for immunization?
[01:07:36.424 --> 01:07:40.346]  All of these problems disappear if you have a good supply of storable food.
[01:07:40.346 --> 01:07:43.507]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:07:43.867 --> 01:07:45.108]  How much will you need?
[01:07:45.108 --> 01:07:46.109]  We don't know.
[01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:47.310]  How much do you want?
[01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:48.771]  All you can get.
[01:07:48.771 --> 01:07:50.832]  Storable food puts you in control.
[01:07:50.832 --> 01:07:52.233]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:07:52.233 --> 01:07:56.296]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:56.296 --> 01:08:02.161]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:08.786]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.786 --> 01:08:11.768]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.409 --> 01:08:17.654]  It is the second day of June.
[01:08:19.745 --> 01:08:21.987]  2009 on this Tuesday.
[01:08:21.987 --> 01:08:23.728]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:08:23.728 --> 01:08:26.709]  We just started simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:37.756]  We will simulcast the last two hours and 52 minutes today of this four-hour show that we do Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:37.756 --> 01:08:38.437]  to 3 p.m.
[01:08:38.437 --> 01:08:39.718]  Central Standard Time.
[01:08:39.718 --> 01:08:41.539]  And so much always happens over the weekend.
[01:08:41.539 --> 01:08:44.301]  I come in on Sunday evenings 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:08:44.301 --> 01:08:47.723]  Central Standard Time at the end of one week and the start of the next.
[01:08:48.423 --> 01:08:51.445]  To look at the week past and the week to come.
[01:08:51.445 --> 01:08:53.346]  So we are here six days a week live.
[01:08:53.346 --> 01:09:06.094]  Don't forget, here on the Genesis Network also, we have Jason Bermas live, nine to midnight, out of these same studios, all three hours of that show is simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv for the PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:09:06.094 --> 01:09:10.736]  And I was just thinking, we need to get Mike Rivera on for a couple hours on Jason Bermas' show.
[01:09:12.218 --> 01:09:16.743]  I would imagine it would make quite a team covering the news and information.
[01:09:16.743 --> 01:09:23.953]  Before I go to the illustrious Mike Rivero, who by the way has his own great WhatReallyHappened.com t-shirt you should get to support him.
[01:09:23.953 --> 01:09:24.954]  You want it, you got it.
[01:09:24.954 --> 01:09:27.858]  Listeners had the idea for us to put the Gadsden flag.
[01:09:27.858 --> 01:09:28.759]  Don't tread on me.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:46.557]  Uh, Unite or Die, Live Free or Die, this same image of the rattlesnake had all three things under it on different flags, but this is the most popular, used by the Marine Corps and the Army, now listed by the Feds as terrorism and as a reason to be taken into jail.
[01:09:47.406 --> 01:09:51.590]  Now, that's in the Homeland Security and MIAC documents.
[01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:58.596]  I have to tell you, I've been wearing these in public, I've been wearing the Minuteman shirt in public, and later if I have time I'll tell stories.
[01:09:58.596 --> 01:10:02.519]  Literally, I was at the IGA food place at like 9.30 at night,
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:04.441]  We're good to go.
[01:10:19.108 --> 01:10:19.268]  I think?
[01:10:35.526 --> 01:10:37.067]  This pad right here.
[01:10:37.067 --> 01:10:45.831]  And he came up and looked at the front of my shirt, looked at my back, and I almost said something to him, but I was all sunburned and brain dead and just wanted to go home and go to sleep and go back to the back of the cabin.
[01:10:45.831 --> 01:10:52.334]  And I just kind of let him do it and, you know, look at it, the front and back of the shirt, and then he kind of stood down and acted like he was looking at something and walked off.
[01:10:52.334 --> 01:10:54.415]  Because, see, they all get the reports.
[01:10:54.415 --> 01:10:57.356]  You've got to watch somebody that's got a Minuteman on their shirt.
[01:10:57.356 --> 01:11:00.417]  You've got to watch people that talk about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:11:00.417 --> 01:11:01.418]  So I hope everybody
[01:11:01.718 --> 01:11:03.598]  We'll get this shirt and I hope we'll all wear it.
[01:11:03.598 --> 01:11:05.619]  It's available at Infowars.com.
[01:11:05.619 --> 01:11:07.759]  And stop being such cowardly slaves.
[01:11:07.759 --> 01:11:13.100]  If we give in to the chilling effect and give in to this demonization, then they're going to win.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.200]  But they are the kooks.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.800]  That security guard was a kook.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:24.022]  The off-duty cops with their wives walking on the beach that would stop and look at the shirts and they'd be walking and looking and then kind of scared.
[01:11:24.022 --> 01:11:27.103]  And some of these guys were big guys, you know, high and tight haircuts.
[01:11:27.103 --> 01:11:29.323]  And they'd kind of read it and look and I'd go, hi, how are you doing?
[01:11:31.181 --> 01:11:33.103]  I mean, God, here's one of them.
[01:11:33.103 --> 01:11:33.944]  He's with the Founders.
[01:11:33.944 --> 01:11:34.844]  He's with Liberty.
[01:11:34.844 --> 01:11:35.465]  He's with Freedom.
[01:11:35.465 --> 01:11:36.626]  He's with the Bill of Rights.
[01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:37.407]  He's one of them.
[01:11:37.407 --> 01:11:38.648]  Oh my God, he wants to kill me.
[01:11:38.648 --> 01:11:41.210]  He wants to... And, you know, in a way it is.
[01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:43.132]  It is true that we're going to be enemies.
[01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:46.134]  You've chosen evil, you know, the Soviet Nazi way.
[01:11:46.134 --> 01:11:47.716]  We've chosen the Republic.
[01:11:47.716 --> 01:11:49.918]  And so we are, I guess, enemies of the New World Order.
[01:11:49.918 --> 01:11:51.659]  And you know it's going to be a hot war.
[01:11:51.659 --> 01:11:55.282]  And I guess they realize I'm wearing the wrong colors.
[01:11:55.282 --> 01:11:56.603]  I'm wearing American colors.
[01:11:57.284 --> 01:11:59.445]  You know, these guys just wrap themselves in the flags.
[01:11:59.445 --> 01:12:01.086]  They don't live it.
[01:12:01.086 --> 01:12:05.748]  They just use the flag as an excuse to urinate all over what this country stands for.
[01:12:05.748 --> 01:12:15.654]  So let me tell you, they are scared of these, and these federal reports have gone out to the smallest departments, and you want to see a vampire, you know, having holy water thrown on him, or a cross.
[01:12:16.514 --> 01:12:18.055]  This is the shirt.
[01:12:18.055 --> 01:12:19.696]  Because this is a ghost.
[01:12:19.696 --> 01:12:26.441]  Every time they would see the Minuteman on my shirt, the other shirt, let's punch that up for folks, it was as if they had seen a ghost.
[01:12:26.441 --> 01:12:27.602]  And I guess it was.
[01:12:27.602 --> 01:12:29.603]  Liberty and Freedom is dying.
[01:12:29.603 --> 01:12:32.045]  There were Homeland Security trucks driving up and down the beach.
[01:12:32.045 --> 01:12:35.387]  You try to go to the National Seashore, they got license plate scanners everywhere.
[01:12:35.387 --> 01:12:38.369]  They ask you questions about why you're going to the National Seashore.
[01:12:38.369 --> 01:12:40.271]  This country is going into tyranny.
[01:12:40.271 --> 01:12:42.933]  Mike Rivero, good to have you joining us from Hawaii, sir.
[01:12:43.911 --> 01:12:45.895]  Aloha nui nui nui.
[01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:47.619]  What do you think of my contraband shirt?
[01:12:47.619 --> 01:12:48.240]  I mean, I'm evil.
[01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:55.427]  Well, absolutely, absolutely you are, and it looks really good on you, I have to say that at the same time.
[01:12:55.427 --> 01:12:59.510]  Some of the shirts that we have, you know, we get these mixed reactions to.
[01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:10.536]  Pretty much everyone sort of gives a stink face with the Eat the Rich t-shirts, but the one about I survived the Bush economy and all I have left is this lousy t-shirt, that one tends to get a lot of laughs.
[01:13:10.536 --> 01:13:17.980]  But while I was listening to you, I have a suggestion, and I'll probably do this on my t-shirts and you should do it on yours, is just something where instead of
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:18.881]  Yeah, that means me as well.
[01:13:18.881 --> 01:13:26.808]  The government is sticking me with all these hundreds of thousands of dollars of bills to give to the bank and maybe start pulling them over a little bit more to our side rather than justifying their paranoia and their defensiveness.
[01:13:44.946 --> 01:13:46.007]  Well, no, I agree with you.
[01:13:46.007 --> 01:14:02.362]  In fact, I didn't confront the security guard, but I mean, he came up, he was acting like he was buying something, then he walked right over and looked at my shirt and then looked at the back because they'd looked at me on surveillance camera and, you know, come down to see this dangerous person with a Minuteman on his shirt.
[01:14:02.362 --> 01:14:09.589]  God forbid I wear this yellow one in public, but I thought that was made up and exaggerated, but I had all these shirts printed up
[01:14:11.343 --> 01:14:19.052]  And now I'm wearing them around town and other places and I'm experiencing it where, where, I mean, these cops have really been brainwashed.
[01:14:19.052 --> 01:14:23.077]  And exactly, they're having their futures destroyed as well, Mike.
[01:14:23.077 --> 01:14:26.461]  They should want to stand with the Gadsden flag.
[01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:28.383]  They should want to stand with Paul Revere.
[01:14:28.383 --> 01:14:30.005]  I mean, how is Paul Revere bad?
[01:14:32.096 --> 01:14:44.884]  Well you're absolutely right and and the point is I think we need to start rethinking our approach to the ordinary man in the street police because you're right they've been brainwashed and given all these reports that say anybody wearing any of these t-shirts we're the bad guys.
[01:14:44.884 --> 01:14:54.370]  So rather than reinforce that I think we need to rethink some of our designs to where we say we're you and I are really the same against this common enemy.
[01:14:54.370 --> 01:15:01.074]  Do you have a half million dollars lying around you're not doing anything with because that's your share of the federal government's debt.
[01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:02.215]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:15:02.215 --> 01:15:03.155]  A lot's going on.
[01:15:03.155 --> 01:15:06.798]  Greg Pallast and others are reporting, basically breaking down the same thing that we've said.
[01:15:06.798 --> 01:15:08.419]  We have the government documents.
[01:15:08.419 --> 01:15:09.320]  GM was planning years ago
[01:15:30.236 --> 01:15:37.359]  To move to China and Brazil and just, you know, to become completely global.
[01:15:37.359 --> 01:15:42.101]  The media keeps billing it as if it's a bankruptcy and socialism and a government bailout.
[01:15:42.101 --> 01:15:42.722]  It's not.
[01:15:42.722 --> 01:15:46.183]  It's just like tax incentives for companies to leave the United States.
[01:15:46.183 --> 01:15:55.788]  This is a tax incentive and under the NAFTA and GATT rules, under the World Trade Organization rules, General Motors cannot use bailout money
[01:15:58.126 --> 01:15:59.587]  To carry out U.S.
[01:15:59.587 --> 01:16:00.187]  operations.
[01:16:00.187 --> 01:16:04.490]  It has to be open to bidding and be spread out globally.
[01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:08.652]  And that's why they said they can't use the economic stimulus money domestically.
[01:16:08.652 --> 01:16:11.734]  It has to be spent internationally.
[01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:22.800]  And so to see GM fall, to see Chrysler fall in the last month, to see the government now saying they're going to buy up basically the newspapers, where do you see all this going, Mike Rivera?
[01:16:24.207 --> 01:16:34.237]  Well, I noticed this morning that our manufacturing index continues to decline, and the bottom line, fundamental truth is, if you're not making products to sell, you cannot save the economy.
[01:16:34.237 --> 01:16:39.521]  It really does seem as if the government simply wants to buy up and own everything.
[01:16:39.521 --> 01:16:40.402]  It's amazing.
[01:16:40.402 --> 01:16:42.985]  The USSR fell and Russia became capitalist.
[01:16:43.445 --> 01:16:53.151]  Now we seem to be heading into this totally communistic, socialistic, fascistic state where the government will own everything, we'll all be technically government employees.
[01:16:53.151 --> 01:16:59.335]  But the bottom line is, if we're not manufacturing, if we're not making products to sell, we can't save this economy.
[01:16:59.335 --> 01:17:00.596]  We just can't.
[01:17:00.596 --> 01:17:08.321]  And every day we get another news report about how the banks are showing profits, not because they're really profitable, but they're playing more of these bookkeeping tricks.
[01:17:08.781 --> 01:17:13.144]  Douglas Goldstein, financial planner & investment advisor, interviewed Jones on Arutz Sheva Radio.
[01:17:25.091 --> 01:17:28.992]  Well, the reason that I've known this was by design was because, Mike, and I know you're
[01:17:51.035 --> 01:18:03.610]  You're not a dull knife yourself there in the drawer that the IMF and World Bank are the international fronts for the private banking family syndicates that are on the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bundesbank and others on record.
[01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:06.213]  And they go around and do the same thing they're doing to the West.
[01:18:06.213 --> 01:18:11.039]  They've done to third world countries in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia and the Middle East.
[01:18:12.116 --> 01:18:18.761]  Though the Middle East knew what this was and hasn't been as trusting, and so they're not being hurt as bad by it.
[01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:23.585]  So they get the old-fashioned military invasion because they won't be economically captured.
[01:18:23.585 --> 01:18:28.169]  Serbia wouldn't take a globalist-controlled central bank, so you saw what happened there.
[01:18:28.169 --> 01:18:30.130]  They hired a bunch of Muslims to attack them.
[01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:32.653]  Then when they defended themselves, they said, oh look, they're evil.
[01:18:32.653 --> 01:18:38.517]  And then Al-Qaeda, the CIA's favorite attack dog, went in against them.
[01:18:38.517 --> 01:18:40.359]  So this happens over and over again.
[01:18:42.369 --> 01:18:44.092]  That's how we know that it's engineered.
[01:18:44.092 --> 01:18:50.442]  Then we have all their different IMF and World Bank documents where they talk about how they want to bring in this crisis to offer the solution.
[01:18:50.442 --> 01:18:53.506]  And George Soros is bragging about how he loves this.
[01:18:53.506 --> 01:18:54.949]  This is the culmination of his life.
[01:18:54.949 --> 01:18:56.111]  He's having a great crisis.
[01:18:58.206 --> 01:19:09.517]  It's rather amazing but you know where I think they're going to stumble on this is I think most people around the world are recognizing that what turned an American economic downturn into a global catastrophe was globalism.
[01:19:09.517 --> 01:19:16.665]  That all this interlinking between countries and I think when they stand up there and say we need more globalism as the solution I think a lot of people are going to get
[01:19:17.105 --> 01:19:19.167]  They're going to be very, very distrustful of this.
[01:19:19.167 --> 01:19:19.787]  They're going to balk.
[01:19:19.787 --> 01:19:21.789]  They're going to say, this doesn't make any sense.
[01:19:21.789 --> 01:19:31.318]  You know, if we've got a house on fire over here, let's not go down the street, chop up the other houses and throw the wood on the fire to try and put it out, which is basically what globalism amounts to.
[01:19:32.521 --> 01:19:33.102]  Absolutely.
[01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:37.985]  You know, there's a host of issues to discuss with Mike Rivero today in the 40 minutes we have left with him.
[01:19:37.985 --> 01:19:42.608]  We're also going to be taking your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:19:42.608 --> 01:19:47.072]  But Mike, when we come back, what are some of the issues you think are most important you'd like to discuss today?
[01:19:48.018 --> 01:19:51.579]  Well, obviously the torture scandal is not going to be going away anytime soon.
[01:19:51.579 --> 01:19:53.399]  We definitely need to deal with that.
[01:19:53.399 --> 01:19:57.460]  We definitely need to deal with the fact that the U.S.
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.601]  government's handling of the economy is exactly opposite what it should be.
[01:20:00.601 --> 01:20:06.683]  You are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[01:20:06.683 --> 01:20:08.463]  Take a deep breath.
[01:20:08.463 --> 01:20:15.005]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[01:20:15.005 --> 01:20:15.965]  Have a glass of water.
[01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:22.190]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other chemicals?
[01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:23.251]  Of course you can't.
[01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:28.395]  The air that you breathe and the water you drink should help maintain good health, not take away from it.
[01:20:28.395 --> 01:20:36.963]  AirAndAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these toxins.
[01:20:36.963 --> 01:20:44.309]  AirAndAqua.com carries whole house air and water purification systems, air conditioners, showerhead filters, water testing kits,
[01:20:44.589 --> 01:20:48.012]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.006 --> 01:21:12.870]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:19.374]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:21.335]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:23.817]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:21:23.817 --> 01:21:34.704]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:36.994 --> 01:21:38.654]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:38.654 --> 01:21:40.515]  It's about a one world government.
[01:21:40.515 --> 01:21:47.417]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:21:47.417 --> 01:21:55.679]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:55.679 --> 01:21:57.240]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:00.080]  The people strike back.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:06.262]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:06.747 --> 01:22:14.870]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:23.033]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:23.033 --> 01:22:27.795]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.115 --> 01:22:33.341]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:33.341 --> 01:22:37.705]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:37.705 --> 01:22:38.786]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:38.786 --> 01:22:43.291]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:48.196]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:50.699]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:55.064]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:55.064 --> 01:22:59.708]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:03.991]  Less than a century ago, half of the American public grew much of their own food.
[01:23:03.991 --> 01:23:08.394]  Today, it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own food.
[01:23:08.394 --> 01:23:12.878]  During the Great Depression, over 18 million people suffered from starvation.
[01:23:12.878 --> 01:23:19.083]  And as America continues down its current path, for many, the reality of another depression is a very serious concern.
[01:23:19.603 --> 01:23:27.277]  With massive layoffs and unemployment at record levels, growing your own food will help you save money that you'd normally spend at the grocery store.
[01:23:27.277 --> 01:23:32.326]  Invest in your family's future by stocking up with your very own supply of seeds available from
[01:23:34.121 --> 01:23:41.107]  Each order includes over 14,000 non-GMO, chemical-free seeds that will provide you with food for years.
[01:23:41.107 --> 01:23:44.270]  Call 877-394-6657 to get 100 varieties of our heirloom seeds for just $49.
[01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:47.793]  Once again, that's GetSeeds.net or call 877-394-6657 to establish your own food supply today!
[01:24:36.932 --> 01:24:42.503]  I'm just glad that I'm not buffalo, bamboozled, hoodwinked, shanghaied.
[01:24:44.686 --> 01:24:49.950]  I'm glad that I know who the globalists are, what their plan is, and I'm aware of it.
[01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:57.435]  And I have a desire, as Thomas Jefferson said, to set bushfires in the minds of men and women everywhere to realize what's really happening.
[01:24:57.435 --> 01:25:06.382]  Yeah, the torture issue isn't going away because they've tried to say it isn't torture, but everybody knows waterboarding and raping people's children in front of them, as the Army's own report admits, is torture.
[01:25:06.382 --> 01:25:11.906]  Now it comes out, what we already knew, the Democrats were complicit all along in going along with this.
[01:25:11.906 --> 01:25:12.667]  Bush protects
[01:25:13.147 --> 01:25:14.529]  They protect them when they're out of office.
[01:25:14.529 --> 01:25:16.851]  They protect him when he's out of office.
[01:25:16.851 --> 01:25:21.195]  And really, I think the illusion that was Obama is now imploding.
[01:25:21.195 --> 01:25:26.660]  You know, even Lou Rockwell was on the show Friday and he said he had supported Obama early on, believing all this crap.
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.222]  You had done that.
[01:25:28.222 --> 01:25:33.847]  But I think now the fact that we've all been betrayed only illustrates how both parties are controlled.
[01:25:33.847 --> 01:25:36.270]  Where do you see this torture scandal going?
[01:25:37.355 --> 01:25:39.957]  Well, it's going to keep on growing.
[01:25:39.957 --> 01:25:41.719]  It's going to go on festering.
[01:25:41.719 --> 01:25:53.610]  I think Barack Obama committed a major mistake by trying to block the release of these most recent photographs because, first of all, it shows he's an accessory after the fact in war crimes.
[01:25:53.610 --> 01:25:54.871]  He's complicit in the cover-up.
[01:25:55.512 --> 01:26:09.767]  And more to the point, now that he's gone to the Supreme Court and they've given him an additional 30 days to file documents regarding whether or not these pictures should be sealed, it gives the world another 30 days to let their imaginations run free about what the pictures might show.
[01:26:09.767 --> 01:26:12.490]  And after 30 days, no matter what pictures are released,
[01:26:13.191 --> 01:26:17.835]  People are going to assume they've been altered, they've been airbrushed, they've been faked, they've been sanitized.
[01:26:17.835 --> 01:26:20.237]  So it's just made matters all that much worse.
[01:26:20.237 --> 01:26:40.033]  We're getting confirmation reports from other sources that these pictures do indeed show the sexual assault of people and the bottom line is that the US government's credibility on the torture issue or the enhanced interrogation is that somehow these people deserved it and that somehow these methods were necessary to protect lives
[01:26:40.353 --> 01:26:49.461]  But when you get into situations of children being sodomized in front of their mothers, nobody's going to believe that that had anything to do with protecting national security.
[01:26:49.461 --> 01:26:55.046]  And the bottom line is, behind all of it, the real core issue that is the most protected point in this scandal.
[01:26:55.646 --> 01:26:59.069]  Is the fact that, you know, we've had Chinese come out and admit it.
[01:26:59.069 --> 01:27:01.051]  Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11.
[01:27:01.051 --> 01:27:03.433]  We all know there were no weapons of mass destruction.
[01:27:03.433 --> 01:27:08.318]  The entire war in Iraq hinged on the claim that Iraq was aiding Al-Qaeda.
[01:27:08.318 --> 01:27:14.364]  We now know that was based on a single confession extracted under torture.
[01:27:14.364 --> 01:27:19.208]  And as soon as the torture was over, the guy retracted the confession and said, look, I just said that to get you to stop.
[01:27:20.089 --> 01:27:28.978]  And now that, of course, people are trying to find out just how we got into Iraq, this individual has conveniently committed suicide or been suicided.
[01:27:28.978 --> 01:27:31.840]  And so this is the real scandal behind it all.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:35.384]  Forget all the sodomy and the rape and all the rest of the stuff.
[01:27:35.384 --> 01:27:40.709]  It's the fact that the entire war in Iraq and 4,000 dead Americans and thousands more crippled
[01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:44.770]  Was based on a confession extracted under torture.
[01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:47.131]  We had no real legitimate reason to be there.
[01:27:47.131 --> 01:27:50.752]  We have no real legitimate reason to remain.
[01:27:50.752 --> 01:27:52.313]  Why are we still in there?
[01:27:52.313 --> 01:27:55.614]  Why is Obama talking about extending our troop presence there?
[01:27:55.614 --> 01:27:57.354]  Strengthening our troop presence there?
[01:27:57.354 --> 01:28:01.275]  Another hundred billion dollar war appropriation just passed Congress.
[01:28:01.275 --> 01:28:01.816]  Why?
[01:28:01.816 --> 01:28:03.096]  What are we doing there?
[01:28:03.096 --> 01:28:05.997]  The entire war is based on a lie.
[01:28:06.437 --> 01:28:07.657]  We are the bad guys.
[01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:10.098]  We are the aggressors in this current war.
[01:28:10.098 --> 01:28:17.120]  And if you look at the history of the 20th century, every major war was ultimately lost by the country that started it.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.660]  So guess where that sets us up?
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:21.801]  I'm not surprised our soldiers are committing suicide in such numbers.
[01:28:21.801 --> 01:28:24.942]  They know they're the bad guys.
[01:28:24.942 --> 01:28:29.203]  Well, it's amazing to see this unfolding.
[01:28:29.203 --> 01:28:30.043]  And on top of that,
[01:28:31.826 --> 01:28:40.036]  The media is playing a game here when they act like they didn't know it was torture and they have a debate about whether it's torture or not or whether torture was ordered.
[01:28:40.036 --> 01:28:49.228]  We have all the White House memos, but before we had the orders and before we found out Pelosi was in on it and that she tried to lie about that,
[01:28:50.484 --> 01:29:03.827]  I remember in the three or four months after 9-11, Washington Post articles that are in my film Road to Tyranny, where they thought they had the public where they wanted them, with 90 plus percent approval ratings, so they tried to sell pure evil at that point, and it said,
[01:29:05.117 --> 01:29:31.444]  Detainees children being used to get answers and then it said we're quote putting pressure and the article went on to say torture of children in front of their parents to get answers and so and I'll never forget being out in Hollywood because I was going on a national TV show out there and I'll never forget being in a hotel room watching a press conference with Rumsfeld bragging how they were torturing.
[01:29:31.444 --> 01:29:32.985]  Why doesn't the media go get
[01:29:34.412 --> 01:29:38.554]  All those clips of him saying that, and all those articles, and then there's no more debate.
[01:29:38.554 --> 01:29:39.655]  We arrest these people.
[01:29:39.655 --> 01:29:42.377]  Because the whole government, both parties are involved.
[01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:46.699]  We'll talk to Mike Rivero and take your phone calls on the other side of this long segment that's coming up.
[01:29:46.699 --> 01:29:48.400]  His website's whatreallyhappened.com.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:51.182]  Our sites are infowars.com and prisonpundit.com.
[01:29:51.182 --> 01:29:52.563]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.563 --> 01:29:55.104]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.104 --> 01:29:57.806]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.779 --> 01:30:06.002]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:30:06.002 --> 01:30:10.025]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:10.025 --> 01:30:15.929]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.929 --> 01:30:16.569]  It's true.
[01:30:16.569 --> 01:30:20.992]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.992 --> 01:30:27.537]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:30:27.537 --> 01:30:27.977]  Number four,
[01:30:28.197 --> 01:30:31.098]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:30:31.098 --> 01:30:34.740]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:35.600]  Number 5.
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.462]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:30:39.462 --> 01:30:43.384]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[01:30:43.624 --> 01:30:45.185]  A long time sponsor of ours.

[01:30:57.809 --> 01:31:03.071]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.071 --> 01:31:07.833]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[01:31:07.833 --> 01:31:09.914]  We need to be independent in food and water.
[01:31:13.186 --> 01:31:13.866]  We're good to go.
[01:31:30.333 --> 01:31:33.414]  You can do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:31:33.414 --> 01:31:38.555]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:38.555 --> 01:31:44.817]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, free stride, dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:31:44.817 --> 01:31:48.578]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:48.578 --> 01:31:49.858]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.858 --> 01:31:50.559]  Take action today.
[01:31:50.559 --> 01:31:51.819]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:32:02.237 --> 01:32:04.058]  GCN self-reliance update.
[01:32:04.058 --> 01:32:08.582]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:32:08.582 --> 01:32:16.467]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:32:16.789 --> 01:32:19.891]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:32:19.891 --> 01:32:27.536]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:32:27.536 --> 01:32:33.120]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:39.183]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:32:39.183 --> 01:32:42.745]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:32:42.745 --> 01:32:46.327]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:51.390]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:54.312]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:32:54.312 --> 01:32:54.492]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:33:19.306 --> 01:33:20.247]  We are back live.
[01:33:20.247 --> 01:33:21.548]  Mike Rivero is our guest.
[01:33:21.548 --> 01:33:24.030]  Going to your phone calls in T-minus five minutes.
[01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:35.519]  And I want to get into how Mike sees this collapse, this control collapse, the economy unfolding and developing.
[01:33:35.519 --> 01:33:40.884]  Before we go back to Mike Rivero, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[01:33:40.884 --> 01:33:43.246]  One of them is Homegain.
[01:33:43.246 --> 01:33:47.169]  And Homegain's website is H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[01:33:49.170 --> 01:33:51.032]  It is an absolutely free website.
[01:33:51.032 --> 01:33:54.575]  HomeGain.com is absolutely, totally free.
[01:33:54.575 --> 01:33:56.737]  It is sponsor-driven.
[01:33:56.737 --> 01:33:57.758]  Great folks.
[01:33:57.758 --> 01:33:59.941]  Been around for more than 10 years.
[01:33:59.941 --> 01:34:05.146]  Be sure and click on Max the Little Orange Gorilla at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:05.146 --> 01:34:12.032]  If you forget the website address, you can just link through there at InfoWars.com by clicking on Max the Orange Home Gain Gorilla.
[01:34:12.952 --> 01:34:14.133]  HomeGain.com.
[01:34:14.133 --> 01:34:18.378]  Enter your street address and info and it will give you the true market value of your home.
[01:34:18.378 --> 01:34:27.687]  They also have a system that's a home sale maximizer that will tell you the least expensive upgrades that statistically will boost the price of your house the most.
[01:34:27.687 --> 01:34:31.851]  Just a lot of neat things like that at H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[01:34:31.851 --> 01:34:36.176]  And one other sponsor I want to tell you about is Survival Seed Bank.
[01:34:37.455 --> 01:34:43.197]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:34:43.197 --> 01:34:45.057]  There have been a lot of times in U.S.
[01:34:45.057 --> 01:34:51.239]  history, pilgrims for example, when seeds have the highest value barter item of anything out there.
[01:34:51.239 --> 01:34:52.939]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds.
[01:34:52.939 --> 01:34:55.920]  You know, they've passed a law in Europe where you've got to have a license to own them.
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.401]  Waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[01:35:00.401 --> 01:35:01.842]  Governments are storing seeds.
[01:35:01.842 --> 01:35:02.222]  The U.N.
[01:35:02.222 --> 01:35:03.282]  is storing seeds.
[01:35:03.282 --> 01:35:06.123]  Globalists of every stripe are storing seeds near the Arctic Circle.
[01:35:06.903 --> 01:35:08.444]  Why do you think this is?
[01:35:08.444 --> 01:35:09.285]  You know why.
[01:35:09.285 --> 01:35:10.646]  Control and power.
[01:35:10.646 --> 01:35:16.551]  Solutions from science is trying to get the seeds out of the globalist hands and into the hands of the people, one seed bank at a time.
[01:35:16.551 --> 01:35:19.273]  Check out their website at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:35:19.273 --> 01:35:21.274]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:35:21.274 --> 01:35:22.215]  That's 877-327-0365 or survivalseedbank.com.
[01:35:22.215 --> 01:35:23.796]  Okay, let us now go back to Mike Rivera.
[01:35:35.312 --> 01:35:59.066]  Shifting gears to Europe, here the establishment and the Bilderberg Group was in the EU Observer and other papers a few months ago, as I'm sure you saw, being a newshound, bragging Etienne Daveny on the Chairman of the Bilderberg Group, oh we set up the Euro by covert action, we're setting up the North American Union by covert action, the Transatlantic Treaty Organization, signed by George Bush in 2007, that's all covered in Endgame.
[01:35:59.066 --> 01:36:02.988]  It's all out in the open and they laugh at us publicly knowing most people don't read the newspaper.
[01:36:04.946 --> 01:36:11.542]  And then spinning it that it's all for our own good, here they just deny we're in a North American Union, though under treaty we've been in one since 2005.
[01:36:14.213 --> 01:36:19.077]  And then we have to fight for years admitting that there's a Napa Superhighway going in in Texas.
[01:36:19.077 --> 01:36:24.620]  The media denies it exists, then it admits it exists, but then says, okay, we're canceling it.
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:29.604]  But the third paragraph in the AP article a few months ago said, well, actually, they're getting rid of the name.
[01:36:29.604 --> 01:36:33.647]  They're just going to keep it and not give it a name and have it piece by piece.
[01:36:33.647 --> 01:36:35.888]  But the whole project continues.
[01:36:35.888 --> 01:36:37.830]  Well, in Europe, it's another form of spin.
[01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:40.672]  And I want to ask you how we fight this and where you see this going.
[01:36:41.772 --> 01:36:44.995]  Because, as you know, Zelikow, the U.S.
[01:36:44.995 --> 01:36:53.282]  head of the World Bank, big neocon, came out in Bloomberg over the weekend and said, look, there's going to be a worldwide revolution.
[01:36:53.282 --> 01:36:56.724]  The trillions we've given to the banks, the people are going to find out we did it.
[01:36:56.724 --> 01:36:58.226]  He's speaking with incredible candor.
[01:36:58.226 --> 01:36:59.146]  They're going to come after us.
[01:36:59.887 --> 01:37:01.347]  And then he didn't really say anything after that.
[01:37:01.347 --> 01:37:08.870]  He just kind of made the announcement, kind of like he was a white-tailed deer throwing his tail up, you know, high-tailing it, saying, look out, they're coming for us.
[01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:11.791]  So a lot of weird, mixed signals, but with Zelikow.
[01:37:11.791 --> 01:37:15.632]  But in Europe, every time they let him vote, as you know, in the Netherlands or in
[01:37:16.912 --> 01:37:17.493]  I don't know.
[01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:37.453]  Jackie Smith said, you know, arrest talk show host if they come here.
[01:37:37.453 --> 01:37:38.814]  You're not allowed to criticize immigrants.
[01:37:38.814 --> 01:37:41.356]  Michael Savage, she was following EU rules.
[01:37:41.356 --> 01:37:46.521]  Well now, Reuters reports, poll finds Irish support EU's Libson Treaty rises.
[01:37:46.521 --> 01:37:48.582]  They're going to try to have another vote.
[01:37:48.582 --> 01:37:54.907]  And they did this last time, saying it was going to win last year in Ireland, and then it lost.
[01:37:54.907 --> 01:37:58.350]  So they, I mean, how do you deal with this level of deception?
[01:37:58.350 --> 01:37:59.251]  And where is all this going?
[01:38:00.066 --> 01:38:09.980]  Well, the good news is because these deceptions are being repeatedly exposed and people are seeing this incredible disconnect between what the corporate media is saying and the reality on the ground.
[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:16.629]  I would cite as a local example some of these incredibly bogus polls, very obviously bogus polls we're seeing in the corporate media.
[01:38:17.089 --> 01:38:22.312]  About how Americans want Guantanamo kept open and they don't want investigations into torture.
[01:38:22.312 --> 01:38:24.653]  I mean, the first rule of propaganda is for it to work.
[01:38:24.653 --> 01:38:26.254]  It's got to be believable.
[01:38:26.254 --> 01:38:37.319]  And our corporate media has gone so far past that line right now where people, and this is why they're losing audience and why people are coming over to the Alex Jones Show and the What Really Happened Show and they're coming to the blogosphere.
[01:38:37.879 --> 01:38:41.822]  Because the propaganda has reached an unbelievable level.
[01:38:41.822 --> 01:38:52.691]  Now, getting back to the situation about the economy, I think a big reason the people of the world are rejecting this globalism and these unions is for two reasons.
[01:38:52.691 --> 01:38:59.696]  One, they know it's not for their benefit, it's for the benefit of the banks, so they can have a bigger pile of money that they can siphon off of.
[01:38:59.696 --> 01:39:02.759]  And at bottom line, when you talk about a global governance,
[01:39:03.786 --> 01:39:05.568]  That's what Alexander the Great wanted.
[01:39:05.568 --> 01:39:06.710]  That's what Napoleon wanted.
[01:39:06.710 --> 01:39:08.131]  That's what Hitler wanted.
[01:39:08.131 --> 01:39:13.378]  And people understand that global governance is not about wise management of the globe.
[01:39:13.378 --> 01:39:20.987]  It's about some individual or some small group standing up on top of a monument built to their own glory and screaming, I am in control of it all.
[01:39:20.987 --> 01:39:21.968]  Am I not really cool?
[01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:26.671]  And I think we've kind of had enough of that sort of situation.
[01:39:26.671 --> 01:39:36.537]  And as I said before, the current economic downturn on the entire planet is because of globalism, and most people are smart enough to realize more globalism is not going to fix it.
[01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:48.483]  Now, interestingly enough, we brought up a concept at my own show yesterday, and I've been getting a ton of email about it, both pro and con, and it has to do with a little theory in international law called an odious debt.
[01:39:48.483 --> 01:39:49.344]  And what that is,
[01:39:49.884 --> 01:39:53.163]  This basically means that when a government ceases to operate,
[01:39:54.537 --> 01:40:05.041]  The debts incurred that were not for the benefit of the people are construed to be personal debts of the government officials themselves and the people don't have to pay them back.
[01:40:05.041 --> 01:40:05.621]  The U.S.
[01:40:05.621 --> 01:40:10.183]  used this to get Cuba off the hook for debts run up by the Spanish occupation.
[01:40:10.183 --> 01:40:14.884]  Mexico used this principle to repudiate the debts run up by the Emperor Maximilian.
[01:40:14.884 --> 01:40:21.867]  Basically what it means is that at some point in the future, if the government of the United States should collapse the way the USSR did,
[01:40:22.367 --> 01:40:33.994]  All of this money spent on wars of aggression, all these debts run up for the bailouts, all the money borrowed for walls and security and surveillance and all of this other stuff that didn't really improve the lot of the common people.
[01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:36.876]  We the people are not going to be held liable for that debt anymore.
[01:40:36.876 --> 01:40:42.880]  Well that's what I was going to get to next and I want you to continue with the punchline here with the key.
[01:40:44.325 --> 01:40:46.586]  But that is so central.
[01:40:46.586 --> 01:40:48.687]  Not just odious debt, fraudulent debt.
[01:40:48.687 --> 01:40:53.590]  A contract that's fraudulent, a contract that's carried out through deception is null and void.
[01:40:53.590 --> 01:41:03.034]  And as a free human being, I don't own and I don't owe a half million dollars to foreign offshore banks.
[01:41:03.034 --> 01:41:04.054]  A, I don't have it.
[01:41:04.054 --> 01:41:06.416]  B, it was set up fraudulently.
[01:41:06.416 --> 01:41:09.077]  I mean, we even pay taxes to the offshore banks.
[01:41:10.458 --> 01:41:36.732]  to give them the money and then we pay interest on the money we pay taxes to give them this is the greatest ponzi scheme fraud they want to carry their ponzi scheme through to the next level through fraud so uh... it is fraudulent and that's why china and russia and europe and japan are saying can you guys pay this back because they know they can do the math we've gone from the average american owning
[01:41:37.752 --> 01:41:45.863]  Uh, you know, uh, more money and more assets than they did debts to being a total debtor nation in 2007.
[01:41:45.863 --> 01:41:50.769]  And at the worst debtor level we've been in our history.
[01:41:50.769 --> 01:41:54.194]  The previous record of a some debtor nation was in late 1933.
[01:41:55.896 --> 01:41:58.377]  And so we physically can't pay it back.
[01:41:58.377 --> 01:41:59.517]  It's fraudulent.
[01:41:59.517 --> 01:42:04.538]  The world knows that we all owe over a half million dollars and it's now going hyperbolic.
[01:42:04.538 --> 01:42:14.881]  It's going from a couple hundred thousand a year ago to five hundred thousand now and accelerating towards a million dollars in debt per American within two years, the Wall Street Journal reports.
[01:42:14.881 --> 01:42:19.702]  And no police state is going to be able to extract this out of the slaves
[01:42:21.023 --> 01:42:22.225]  The country is imploding.
[01:42:22.225 --> 01:42:29.273]  The illegal aliens are bankrupting everything in the Southwest because they're in the social welfare net because they're not paid enough to live.
[01:42:29.273 --> 01:42:30.655]  I mean, this is all coming to a head.
[01:42:30.655 --> 01:42:32.598]  So where do you see all this going, Mike Rivera?
[01:42:33.137 --> 01:42:43.824]  Well, there's a fundamental principle about the debt-based currency system that we find at the heart of the Federal Reserve, and that is that the instant it goes into operation, more money is owed to the banks than is actually physically in existence.
[01:42:43.824 --> 01:42:47.327]  We talk about the federal government being $65 trillion in debt.
[01:42:47.327 --> 01:42:50.329]  Most of that is debt of money that is fictional.
[01:42:50.529 --> 01:42:52.670]  It never really existed in the first place.
[01:42:52.670 --> 01:43:04.598]  It is simply notes in a ledger that the interest is accruing over time, and so the money doesn't exist, and unless we go out and conquer other countries, we're never going to come up with it, and we have to collapse.
[01:43:04.598 --> 01:43:16.985]  The problem with bringing a global bank into line with the same debt-based currency where all money is borrowed from a central bank, when it gets to the point of collapse, there are no other places to go for money.
[01:43:16.985 --> 01:43:17.786]  So a global
[01:43:18.186 --> 01:43:26.532]  Debt-based, Federal Reserve-style bank, inevitably will plunge the entire world into an incredible depression where we're going to wind up eating each other.
[01:43:26.532 --> 01:43:29.835]  And this is why it must be avoided at all costs.
[01:43:29.835 --> 01:43:30.555]  I agree with you.
[01:43:30.555 --> 01:43:40.082]  Let's take some calls from Mike Rivero, joining us from Hawaii via video cam right now, simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv and at Genesis on the radio.
[01:43:40.082 --> 01:43:42.664]  Let's go ahead and talk to Peter in Iraq.
[01:43:42.664 --> 01:43:44.205]  Peter, thank you for holding.
[01:43:44.205 --> 01:43:44.966]  You're on the air.
[01:43:48.274 --> 01:43:53.758]  Hey Alex, Jesse Ventura made a great point the other day, and I just want to bring it back up.
[01:43:53.758 --> 01:44:05.527]  He was saying that, and I know you're all about a bloodless, peaceful revolution, and he made a great point about how, oh, I'm too old to re-enlist and take back the military.
[01:44:05.527 --> 01:44:15.434]  Well, wouldn't you think it would be a great idea to have people enlist in the military who are enlightened, who know what's going on, and then when they give the orders, just
[01:44:16.024 --> 01:44:22.549]  Sorry, I just work to uphold the Constitution, not any executive branch or anybody else.
[01:44:22.549 --> 01:44:28.533]  Yes, I mean, I've said that it's all... I mean, that's a very complex issue, and I want to get Mike Rivero's take on that as well.
[01:44:28.533 --> 01:44:43.204]  Look, we know that as the police get more and more corrupt leadership, and as they're told to do more and more things that are unconstitutional, and as the media plays these mind games and legitimizes it all, that the stupid, ignorant, foolish, or wicked people
[01:44:44.548 --> 01:44:44.748]  I think?
[01:45:01.988 --> 01:45:03.329]  Then it's a race to the bottom.
[01:45:03.329 --> 01:45:17.638]  But how can you expect good people to stay in when they're going to be sent on fraudulent missions, when they're going to be stuck in bad situations, where they're going to be given these experimental vaccines and shots?
[01:45:17.638 --> 01:45:21.461]  I think it's a good thing that there are a lot of good people in the military.
[01:45:21.461 --> 01:45:26.284]  At the same time, I wouldn't wish anybody to join this military that's controlled by offshore banks.
[01:45:26.284 --> 01:45:30.947]  I mean, we know that of any Democrat or any Republican, Ron Paul got the most money.
[01:45:31.664 --> 01:45:40.451]  I mean, Ron Paul got over 70% of the military contributions until he got out of the race, and then Obama got most of them because he was saying it in the war.
[01:45:40.451 --> 01:45:42.353]  So I know the troops are good.
[01:45:42.353 --> 01:45:48.518]  That's why they're trying to replace them with Blackwater and illegal aliens and felons.
[01:45:48.518 --> 01:45:50.280]  So it's a very complex question.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:52.061]  I mean, I can't make that decision.
[01:45:52.061 --> 01:45:55.003]  I can't sit here and tell you what I think you should do.
[01:45:55.003 --> 01:45:56.745]  I think that's for you to decide.
[01:45:56.745 --> 01:45:57.305]  Mike Rivera?
[01:45:58.166 --> 01:45:59.447]  Yeah, I absolutely agree.
[01:45:59.447 --> 01:46:06.392]  Unfortunately, the moral and the immoral are mutually exclusive societies, and neither one tolerates the presence of the other.
[01:46:06.392 --> 01:46:11.895]  So once the government and the military and corporate culture starts to go bad, it goes all the way bad.
[01:46:11.895 --> 01:46:15.618]  They go out of their way to eject anybody who's not going to go along with the program.
[01:46:15.618 --> 01:46:17.199]  We saw that with Cynthia McKinney.
[01:46:17.199 --> 01:46:18.300]  We saw it with Ron Paul.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:24.082]  It is almost impossible for an honest, moral person to stay in Congress.
[01:46:24.082 --> 01:46:28.984]  They can get in there for a first time, but they very quickly find themselves on the outs.
[01:46:28.984 --> 01:46:36.706]  It is sort of like, remember the high school clique where all the popular rich kids would get together and they could do whatever they wanted and get away with it all?
[01:46:36.706 --> 01:46:38.027]  That's basically what the U.S.
[01:46:38.027 --> 01:46:39.307]  government has become.
[01:46:39.307 --> 01:46:40.828]  It's the socias.
[01:46:40.828 --> 01:46:41.788]  It's the privileged.
[01:46:42.128 --> 01:46:50.154]  And they basically see themselves as inheritors of the rulership of not only the United States, but of the entire world.
[01:46:50.154 --> 01:46:54.017]  And any sacrifice to that objective is perfectly justified.
[01:46:54.017 --> 01:46:59.841]  We're seeing just in the economic policies here in the United States, there is no respect left for the working class people.
[01:46:59.841 --> 01:47:02.323]  There is no respect even for the middle class people.
[01:47:03.063 --> 01:47:11.485]  The entire bailout consists of taking trillions of dollars from the American people to give to the banks so the banks can loan it back to the American people at interest.
[01:47:11.485 --> 01:47:13.345]  That doesn't really make any sense.
[01:47:13.345 --> 01:47:17.586]  And there's no talk about bringing back manufacturing on which the entire economy has to rest.
[01:47:17.586 --> 01:47:18.126]  No, you're right.
[01:47:18.126 --> 01:47:22.827]  Everything else is being sacrificed on the altar of globalism, which is what they want.
[01:47:22.827 --> 01:47:24.847]  They want a consolidated system.
[01:47:24.847 --> 01:47:28.708]  You know, I just hope when you get back from Iraq, Peter, there's a country to come back to.
[01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:29.928]  Anything else from Iraq, Peter?
[01:47:32.076 --> 01:47:44.180]  Well, I mean, if, uh, if you really expect, uh, the people to stand up and fight, I mean, they have to know how to, even if it's a support job, medic, or whatever.
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:51.962]  Or, I mean, I'm not saying my generation, or even if it's beyond my generation, has, can't, you know, isn't going to have to make sacrifices.
[01:47:51.962 --> 01:47:56.263]  If you're going to have a revolution, if you need... Well, I'll tell you what's going to happen.
[01:47:56.263 --> 01:47:57.324]  People are going to try to CPS...
[01:47:58.735 --> 01:48:00.596]  People's kids, and it's happening more and more.
[01:48:00.596 --> 01:48:01.817]  I see it in the news every week.
[01:48:01.817 --> 01:48:03.618]  And people are just going to kill them.
[01:48:03.618 --> 01:48:07.040]  And cops are going to stop people at a checkpoint, and the citizens are just going to get out.
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.641]  And it's already starting to happen.
[01:48:08.641 --> 01:48:10.982]  And the media kind of keeps it quiet.
[01:48:10.982 --> 01:48:12.403]  But you see the reports all the time.
[01:48:12.403 --> 01:48:13.443]  It's usually old vets.
[01:48:13.443 --> 01:48:15.184]  Korean War, Vietnam.
[01:48:15.184 --> 01:48:21.428]  Most of them are dead now, but they've had a couple cases in Austin where World War II vets would get pulled over and harassed by cops in Hays County.
[01:48:21.428 --> 01:48:23.569]  And the old vet would just get out and kill them.
[01:48:23.569 --> 01:48:26.111]  You know, I'd say, buddy, I'm not your slave that's sitting in Nazi Germany.
[01:48:26.111 --> 01:48:26.511]  You're dead.
[01:48:27.171 --> 01:48:31.235]  And, you know, the cop can argue about that all day and have the media say the old man was bad.
[01:48:31.235 --> 01:48:34.699]  But at the end of the day, there's going to be a lot of blood.
[01:48:34.699 --> 01:48:36.520]  And the system knows that.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:40.985]  And, you know, look, if we're self-sufficient, they can't beat us.
[01:48:40.985 --> 01:48:43.827]  That's why they want to shut down the farms and ranches and get control.
[01:48:44.668 --> 01:48:51.629]  And, uh, you know, if we try to have a Continental Congress or something like that, they're going to send feds in, they'd stage a truck bomb outside and say, we did it.
[01:48:51.629 --> 01:48:54.770]  We've got to grassroots take over the counties and cities.
[01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:57.491]  These big centralized assaults aren't going to work.
[01:48:57.491 --> 01:49:01.511]  We've got to try to keep it peaceful as long as we can, but they're not going to be peaceful.
[01:49:01.511 --> 01:49:02.932]  These guys are arrogant.
[01:49:02.932 --> 01:49:04.412]  They never have lost in the past.
[01:49:04.412 --> 01:49:05.892]  This is what always happens.
[01:49:05.892 --> 01:49:08.513]  They're going to start fights with us and you're going to know.
[01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:16.704]  You're going to know, you know, as more WACOs happen, as more things happen like that, you're just going to have more and more people say, I'm done.
[01:49:16.704 --> 01:49:23.067]  And you're going to have more massacres of kids getting shot and people dying in ambulances because the cops won't let them get to the hospital.
[01:49:23.067 --> 01:49:25.849]  And you're just going to have more and more of this is going to happen.
[01:49:25.849 --> 01:49:27.770]  And it's probably going to be a war.
[01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:31.732]  I mean, if you really want to know, folks, it's probably going to end up in a shooting war in this country.
[01:49:31.732 --> 01:49:32.893]  And I wish that wasn't the case.
[01:49:33.613 --> 01:49:38.317]  Because I've had my butt kicked and I've, you know, lived a little bit.
[01:49:38.317 --> 01:49:44.301]  I know it's not fun and not macho, but it is what it is and I'm not licking boots and I'm not going along with this crap anymore.
[01:49:44.301 --> 01:49:45.943]  And so it is what it is.
[01:49:45.943 --> 01:49:49.565]  And so the troops need to decide whose side they're on and what they're going to do.
[01:49:49.565 --> 01:49:50.666]  Anything else from Iraq?
[01:49:50.666 --> 01:49:52.588]  Peter?
[01:49:52.588 --> 01:49:55.210]  Well, if you don't know how to fight, you're going to be cut down like fodder.
[01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:57.451]  I mean, that's pretty much it.
[01:49:57.451 --> 01:49:59.693]  Just because you can shoot a gun doesn't mean you know what you're doing.
[01:50:02.435 --> 01:50:13.741]  Listen, I understand you're over there in Iraq dealing with the Iraqis and all the rest of them, but the French Resistance caused the Nazis a lot of problems and they'd already been a disarmed public.
[01:50:13.741 --> 01:50:15.022]  It's like moose hunting.
[01:50:15.022 --> 01:50:19.085]  You know, in moose hunting there's a lottery and like one in five guys gets a moose ticket.
[01:50:19.085 --> 01:50:26.289]  I mean, if people actually decided to go after the police and military, let's say there's two million of them, let's say there's three million of them,
[01:50:27.236 --> 01:50:30.238]  I mean, let's say 5 million Americans decided to go moose hunting.
[01:50:30.238 --> 01:50:31.359]  It's over very quickly.
[01:50:31.359 --> 01:50:32.540]  All you've got to get is one moose.
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:38.905]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:50:38.905 --> 01:50:39.746]  Peter?
[01:50:39.746 --> 01:50:54.318]  Yeah, but uh... Oh, absolutely, but if you value your own individual life, you might not want to know what you're doing, so... The revolution might live on, you might, as a whole, win, but if you value your individual life, you might want to know what you're doing.
[01:50:55.219 --> 01:50:56.200]  No, stay there.
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:58.082]  I want to hear more of what you have to say with Mike Ribeiro.
[01:50:58.082 --> 01:51:04.407]  Stay with us.
[01:51:04.407 --> 01:51:05.628]  Newsflash!
[01:51:05.628 --> 01:51:07.350]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:12.314]  The dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[01:51:13.875 --> 01:51:17.856]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[01:51:17.856 --> 01:51:22.478]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[01:51:22.478 --> 01:51:29.480]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy food.
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:37.802]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced price.
[01:51:37.802 --> 01:51:41.643]  So you and your family have a long-term food solution.
[01:51:43.114 --> 01:51:46.897]  The choice between starvation and freedom is made by you.
[01:51:46.897 --> 01:51:48.078]  Right now.
[01:51:48.078 --> 01:51:50.580]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:52.902]  That's survivalistseeds.com.
[01:51:52.902 --> 01:51:56.305]  Because you are almost out of time.
[01:51:56.305 --> 01:52:01.149]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[01:52:01.149 --> 01:52:03.711]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:52:04.321 --> 01:52:06.944]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:06.944 --> 01:52:14.532]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:52:14.532 --> 01:52:20.679]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:21.099 --> 01:52:23.080]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:25.582]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:25.582 --> 01:52:37.150]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:37.150 --> 01:52:38.851]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:38.851 --> 01:52:40.692]  It's about a one-world government.

[01:53:57.551 --> 01:53:57.571]  8654-3447
[01:54:10.319 --> 01:54:12.721]  This is going to be a war of ideas, even if it gets physical.
[01:54:12.721 --> 01:54:17.064]  It's going to be about who is seen in the right, who is going to be seen in the wrong.
[01:54:17.064 --> 01:54:21.647]  And as long as we have the population with us, we're going to win this war against globalism.
[01:54:21.647 --> 01:54:23.208]  But we have to tell that story.
[01:54:23.208 --> 01:54:29.533]  We have to explain the control grid, who the globalists are, what their plan is, what they've done.
[01:54:29.533 --> 01:54:36.498]  You explain to the public that cancer's up several thousand percent from 50 years ago because they're putting cancer viruses in their shots?
[01:54:36.498 --> 01:54:37.698]  We're going to have the army we need.
[01:54:38.567 --> 01:54:41.949]  And then the dying is going to stop.
[01:54:41.949 --> 01:54:42.790]  We're under attack.
[01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:44.271]  We're under military attack.
[01:54:44.271 --> 01:54:47.734]  People just have to have the will to be able to admit how serious this is.
[01:54:47.734 --> 01:54:59.042]  Coming up the 20 after next hour, I'm going to, for 40 minutes, break down just a small snapshot of the Cashless Society control grid, how it ties into cyber security.
[01:54:59.042 --> 01:54:59.282]  Okay?
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.061]  So I'm going to spend 40 minutes on this.
[01:55:02.061 --> 01:55:04.463]  I've done a lot of research, and that's coming up.
[01:55:04.463 --> 01:55:06.664]  We've got this segment and the next with Mike Rivero.
[01:55:06.664 --> 01:55:09.866]  I want to go to Kurt, Roger, Todd, Jeremy, Steve, and others.
[01:55:09.866 --> 01:55:20.753]  But, Peter, you know, as they teach in the military, I know if your boot's on the ground, they're probably not teaching you this, but the point is 90% of war is psychological.
[01:55:20.753 --> 01:55:26.617]  We do need to reach out to the military and police before it's too late, but a lot of them are on power trips or too far gone, especially in police forces.
[01:55:28.099 --> 01:55:51.769]  uh... and and and you know training is fine and dandy and uh... it's great but the problem is the feds are all over that type of training insert their people who call for violence and send folks to prison so if you are going to train, train with people you've known for years people you trust and call it a shooting club a tactical shooting club and don't make it all secret agenty you know just oh we go out to the deer camp and you know we do you know we do this
[01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:59.257]  Uh, and you can, you know, read up on the French Resistance and others in books like Total Resistance and Guerrilla Warfare.
[01:55:59.257 --> 01:56:01.740]  But this is an urban guerrilla warfare, so it's a little bit different.
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:03.802]  First thing I tell the militia, stop wearing camouflage.
[01:56:03.802 --> 01:56:05.264]  I see them in the cities in camo.
[01:56:05.264 --> 01:56:08.508]  You know, in the cities, camo is a sports jacket and a tie.
[01:56:08.948 --> 01:56:11.069]  And, you know, you're real calm and, hi, how you doing?
[01:56:11.069 --> 01:56:15.252]  That's, that's, that's, if things ever went to that, that's, that's, that's your uniform, folks.
[01:56:15.252 --> 01:56:18.194]  It's a button-up shirt and, you know, hi, how you doing?
[01:56:18.194 --> 01:56:20.235]  You better, well, I don't want to get into that.
[01:56:20.235 --> 01:56:25.499]  The point is, is that we don't want to sit there and think too much even about going to that level.
[01:56:25.499 --> 01:56:28.040]  We want to try to stop things politically.
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:29.121]  And things will work themselves.
[01:56:29.121 --> 01:56:32.143]  I mean, Mike Rivera, before I go back to the caller to finish up, any comments on what we're saying?
[01:56:32.762 --> 01:56:33.742]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:56:33.742 --> 01:56:40.224]  I mean, we need to avoid violence as long as possible because violence will only justify further repression by the government.
[01:56:40.224 --> 01:56:46.465]  We know the government likes to plant people within the peace movement to be violent so the media can attack us.
[01:56:46.465 --> 01:56:50.927]  I mean, look at all these so-called phony terrorist groups that were set up by the FBI informants.
[01:56:50.927 --> 01:56:53.187]  This is just the way the other side likes to play.
[01:56:53.187 --> 01:56:55.468]  And so we need to avoid getting sucked into that.
[01:56:55.468 --> 01:56:56.208]  But now they get caught!
[01:56:56.488 --> 01:57:04.154]  Now, it took us years to expose that 93 was a fake deal and that 96 was a fake deal in Miami.
[01:57:04.154 --> 01:57:16.983]  Now it comes out in days, it's totally fake with the FBI leading the group, commanding it, and it comes out that cops everywhere, from Canada to England to the US, dress up like anarchists to discredit the peaceful demonstrators.
[01:57:16.983 --> 01:57:18.224]  I mean, the truth's coming out!
[01:57:19.212 --> 01:57:20.313]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:20.313 --> 01:57:35.702]  We're a much more educated and sophisticated society, and I think our greatest hope for the future is that the powers that be, let me rephrase that, the powers that imagine they are, still don't get how the entire world has been changed by the alternative media and by the blogosphere.
[01:57:35.702 --> 01:57:39.844]  They don't understand we're much more aware, sophisticated, and skeptical.
[01:57:39.844 --> 01:57:43.666]  And they can even try to shut the web down now as they're openly announcing.
[01:57:43.666 --> 01:57:44.627]  It's still too late!
[01:57:44.627 --> 01:57:45.407]  It's over!
[01:57:45.407 --> 01:57:47.448]  Everybody knows you're criminal liars!
[01:57:47.448 --> 01:57:48.449]  Anything else, Peter?
[01:57:50.816 --> 01:58:05.163]  Yeah, um, wasn't there a, uh, excuse me for not remembering his name, there was a, uh, General, uh, American General Mort, uh, who was a Medal of Honor recipient from World War I, and prior to World War II, wasn't, uh, there a- Smedley Butler!
[01:58:05.163 --> 01:58:08.305]  Smedley But- Exactly.
[01:58:08.305 --> 01:58:10.286]  And how did he get to that position?
[01:58:10.286 --> 01:58:12.027]  Uh, I'm sure all he did-
[01:58:12.679 --> 01:58:18.082]  Keep his mouth shut, not scream 9-11 was an inside job every 20 seconds.
[01:58:18.082 --> 01:58:18.962]  Just do your job.
[01:58:18.962 --> 01:58:24.104]  And when it comes down, and you know what's going on, and the water comes down, that's when you do it.
[01:58:24.104 --> 01:58:29.367]  But if you're labeled, oh, you're that guy, instead of just, I'm just doing my job.
[01:58:29.367 --> 01:58:31.028]  No, no, great point.
[01:58:31.028 --> 01:58:34.890]  Butler went along until the very last minute, and then he blew the whistle on him.
[01:58:34.890 --> 01:58:35.730]  You got a great point.
[01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:38.331]  We need sleepers as well in the info war.
[01:58:38.331 --> 01:58:39.212]  So be that sleeper.

[02:00:17.633 --> 02:00:23.238]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.238 --> 02:00:27.802]  Final segment with Mike Rivero.
[02:00:27.802 --> 02:00:33.386]  Yes, there is something to be said, as the last caller was saying from Iraq, the military, to
[02:00:36.266 --> 02:00:42.593]  Keeping your oath, but keeping quiet, and then when the shoe really drops, saying no.
[02:00:42.593 --> 02:00:44.975]  And a lot of troops have done that with these experimental vaccines.
[02:00:44.975 --> 02:00:47.017]  You know, they say it's the law, we can give you whatever we want.
[02:00:47.017 --> 02:00:49.099]  No, none of it's experimental.
[02:00:49.099 --> 02:00:57.128]  That's like, what was really telling was six years ago, Mike Rivera, when they ordered 14 million first responders, firemen, police,
[02:00:58.550 --> 02:01:02.094]  Medical workers, county, city workers who take the smallpox shot.
[02:01:02.094 --> 02:01:09.061]  And the LA Times reported two years into that that only 4,000 of 14 million had done it.
[02:01:09.061 --> 02:01:11.203]  99.9% had said no.
[02:01:11.203 --> 02:01:13.206]  And then Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take it.
[02:01:13.206 --> 02:01:19.893]  I mean, I think they can set up this grid and push it all, but as push comes to shove, this is really going to blow up in their face.
[02:01:21.727 --> 02:01:24.188]  Well, it depends on what the agenda is.
[02:01:24.188 --> 02:01:31.692]  A lot of this vaccination and pushing these medications, it's just really about justifying giving a lot more tax dollars to the pharmaceutical industries.
[02:01:31.692 --> 02:01:36.295]  I mean, we saw that with this whole swine flu brouhaha.
[02:01:36.295 --> 02:01:45.900]  I mean, obviously, given the number of people actually sick and dying from this flu, it shouldn't have been headline-grabbing news, but it did justify a lot of purchases of vaccines.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:53.606]  And the other awareness, of course, is that a lot of these vaccines really are oftentimes more dangerous than the actual disease they're supposed to protect you from.
[02:01:53.606 --> 02:01:56.409]  Look back at the 1976 swine flu outbreak.
[02:01:56.409 --> 02:02:00.872]  More people died from the vaccine than from the flu itself.
[02:02:00.872 --> 02:02:02.053]  You're absolutely right about that.
[02:02:02.053 --> 02:02:04.775]  Let's take another call here from Kurt in Texas.
[02:02:04.775 --> 02:02:05.536]  Kurt, you're on the air.
[02:02:05.536 --> 02:02:05.997]  Go ahead.
[02:02:05.997 --> 02:02:09.660]  This is a subject you covered back last week.
[02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:11.881]  I couldn't get in and talk to you.
[02:02:11.881 --> 02:02:13.603]  I was at Walmart.
[02:02:14.412 --> 02:02:20.574]  And when I started to check out, there was a lady who had a child that was acting up.
[02:02:20.574 --> 02:02:31.778]  And I happened to comment to the cashier that during the time I was raised, if I threw a fit like that, my dad would take off his belt and swat me.
[02:02:31.778 --> 02:02:34.859]  And she says, oh, she became very talkative.
[02:02:34.859 --> 02:02:42.542]  She said, we're told at company meetings that if we see the parent swat the child with their hand,
[02:02:43.055 --> 02:02:45.277]  Yeah, I wanted to back you up.
[02:02:45.277 --> 02:02:46.338]  Let me back you up.
[02:02:46.338 --> 02:02:47.819]  I see articles all over the country
[02:02:58.789 --> 02:03:01.630]  Where a mother grabs the child and says, stop it!
[02:03:01.630 --> 02:03:05.592]  And police show up, and then it's always a footnote that surveillance cameras.
[02:03:05.592 --> 02:03:08.693]  So, the whole society is little spy tattletales.
[02:03:08.693 --> 02:03:10.653]  They're not looking for you stealing stuff half the time.
[02:03:10.653 --> 02:03:12.134]  The employees do two-thirds of the stealing.
[02:03:12.134 --> 02:03:13.455]  That's their own numbers.
[02:03:13.455 --> 02:03:15.895]  It's all about, what's that t-shirt say?
[02:03:15.895 --> 02:03:17.576]  Whoa, did they just spank that child?
[02:03:17.576 --> 02:03:18.416]  Like, stop that!
[02:03:18.416 --> 02:03:19.597]  I told you no with that toy!
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:25.462]  The kids gotta get out of control so they can put them on Ritalin and Prozac so the cops can then taser them.
[02:03:25.462 --> 02:03:31.824]  So, so she was proud of the fact that, oh, we're told to tattle to Homeland Security, I mean Walmart.
[02:03:31.824 --> 02:03:32.584]  Yes.
[02:03:32.584 --> 02:03:34.604]  Was she proud of herself?
[02:03:34.604 --> 02:03:36.165]  Was she proud of herself?
[02:03:36.165 --> 02:03:37.445]  Oh yes, seemed like it.
[02:03:37.445 --> 02:03:49.069]  She was very talkative about how they had told them to watch out and if they see any parents shaking or hollering at the children or swatting them with their hands
[02:03:49.611 --> 02:03:54.752]  Or something in the store to call Child Protective Services immediately.
[02:03:54.752 --> 02:04:00.053]  And, um, I thought, goodness, my father's dead.
[02:04:00.053 --> 02:04:04.254]  If he'd been alive, he'd probably been in jail years ago.
[02:04:04.254 --> 02:04:11.536]  Well, no, no, that's the issue is, and these sociologists and psychiatrists run everything now, they know it's going to cause everything to break down.
[02:04:11.536 --> 02:04:15.717]  It's about, I have the textbooks, they say, we're going to destroy their families.
[02:04:15.717 --> 02:04:16.277]  Mike Rivera,
[02:04:17.284 --> 02:04:18.425]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:04:18.425 --> 02:04:26.470]  It's all about control, and I notice as we have all these governors starting to slash the state budgets, and they're talking about reducing health care for poor families.
[02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:28.251]  We just had that happen here in Hawaii.
[02:04:28.251 --> 02:04:36.837]  The one area of government that is not seeing budget cuts is their surveillance, the spying, the control, the child protective services, the elements of dictatorship.
[02:04:36.837 --> 02:04:38.218]  They're still being fully funded.
[02:04:39.778 --> 02:04:42.563]  Mike Rivero, we'll talk to you again in one month, probably sooner.
[02:04:42.563 --> 02:04:44.927]  Always appreciate your work over at WhatReallyHappened.com.
[02:04:44.927 --> 02:04:46.590]  We'll see you soon, my friend.
[02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:47.191]  Thanks a lot.
[02:04:47.191 --> 02:04:47.551]  Aloha.
[02:04:48.157 --> 02:04:49.498]  Aloha to you, my friend.
[02:04:49.498 --> 02:04:52.179]  He'll be on Genesis later today, 5 o'clock.
[02:04:52.179 --> 02:04:59.202]  Okay, more of your calls straight ahead, and then I'm going to break down the Cashless Society control grid.
[02:04:59.202 --> 02:05:00.222]  Wait until you hear this.
[02:05:00.222 --> 02:05:00.923]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.923 --> 02:05:10.007]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[02:05:10.007 --> 02:05:14.689]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[02:05:15.169 --> 02:05:20.213]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals actually results in disease.
[02:05:20.213 --> 02:05:29.300]  Go to AmericanSuperfoods.com today and see the wide range of foods available that were designed to help your mind and body work the way they were intended to.

[02:05:46.005 --> 02:05:47.706]  Folks, you gotta check these out.
[02:05:47.706 --> 02:05:54.652]  These foods promote nutritional excellence, health and well-being, beauty enhancement, and sustainable rainforest agriculture.
[02:05:54.652 --> 02:05:57.154]  Go to AmericanSuperfoods.com.
[02:05:57.154 --> 02:06:00.036]  Again, the website is AmericanSuperfoods.com.
[02:06:01.368 --> 02:06:07.241]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[02:06:07.241 --> 02:06:08.544]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:06:08.544 --> 02:06:12.432]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called Inner Food.
[02:06:12.796 --> 02:06:14.657]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:06:14.657 --> 02:06:21.719]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[02:06:21.719 --> 02:06:24.980]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:26.721]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[02:06:26.721 --> 02:06:29.722]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[02:06:29.722 --> 02:06:31.442]  And their formula really works.
[02:06:31.442 --> 02:06:34.243]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[02:06:34.243 --> 02:06:40.145]  Try the NutriCafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[02:06:40.505 --> 02:06:42.908]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[02:06:42.908 --> 02:06:45.390]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.
[02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:47.472]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[02:06:47.472 --> 02:06:53.178]  Go to www.enerfood.com.
[02:06:53.178 --> 02:06:57.822]  That's www.enerfood.com.
[02:06:57.822 --> 02:07:00.745]  Or just click on their banner on infowars.com for special pricing.
[02:07:02.025 --> 02:07:07.248]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:07:07.248 --> 02:07:11.271]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:11.271 --> 02:07:17.175]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:17.175 --> 02:07:17.815]  It's true.
[02:07:17.815 --> 02:07:22.238]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:22.238 --> 02:07:28.783]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:07:28.783 --> 02:07:29.223]  Number four,
[02:07:29.443 --> 02:07:32.348]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:07:32.348 --> 02:07:35.993]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:35.993 --> 02:07:36.855]  Number 5.
[02:07:36.855 --> 02:07:40.721]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:07:40.721 --> 02:07:44.647]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[02:07:44.887 --> 02:07:46.428]  A long time sponsor of ours.
[02:07:46.428 --> 02:07:51.129]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.129 --> 02:07:52.910]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.910 --> 02:07:55.471]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[02:07:55.471 --> 02:07:58.112]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[02:08:19.463 --> 02:08:35.777]  All right, I'm going to spend 40 minutes coming up in the next segment, the rest of the hour before Webster Carpenter joins us, going over a small slice of the cashless society, cyber security, global straitjacket, full spectrum dominance grid.
[02:08:35.777 --> 02:08:38.719]  And that's what the Pentagon calls it itself.
[02:08:38.719 --> 02:08:42.602]  And last night and today, I probably wrote 15 pages of notes just of every little point.
[02:08:42.602 --> 02:08:45.385]  And I printed a bunch of articles to back up what I'm saying.
[02:08:47.279 --> 02:08:50.860]  As bad as this is going to sound, this is nothing compared to what it really is.
[02:08:50.860 --> 02:08:52.700]  Nothing.
[02:08:52.700 --> 02:09:04.002]  You just heard the guy about the Walmart employees, if somebody grabs their kid by the arm and says, no, you can't have that toy, cameras are on you, they record your face, take digital photos, the police are waiting for you to take your kids.
[02:09:04.002 --> 02:09:12.084]  That's why you pull up in front of Walmart, and the lady's got four kids in the car, some of them teenagers, she walks five feet to throw money, the Salvation Army box,
[02:09:13.092 --> 02:09:17.635]  Remember, and the police were there, arrested her, CPS-ed all the kids, including the two-year-old.
[02:09:17.635 --> 02:09:22.059]  Because she opened the car, locked it in the winter, ran over, threw the money in.
[02:09:22.059 --> 02:09:27.623]  They're watching, just for white-glove inspection, one thing, no due process, everything's gone.
[02:09:27.623 --> 02:09:29.545]  Your property, your kids, everything.
[02:09:29.545 --> 02:09:31.506]  This government is hyper-evil.
[02:09:31.506 --> 02:09:35.669]  They've trained everybody, basically, to be spies now.
[02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:37.571]  It's just hellish, what they've done.
[02:09:38.345 --> 02:09:49.534]  And they, again, all the Homeland Security, everything is about going after patriots, conservatives, gun owners, people that say, don't tread on me, and you know, fly the Gadsden flag.
[02:09:49.534 --> 02:09:52.756]  It is so over the top, we're being hit from every angle, it's just amazing.
[02:09:52.756 --> 02:09:56.379]  I'm going to take some of your calls coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:09:56.379 --> 02:10:00.783]  Before we do that though, because I get so many calls and questions about it, and he hadn't been on with us in over a month.
[02:10:01.761 --> 02:10:08.588]  I wanted to get a Cola Blue's Tyler Palmer on, the designer and head of the company, co-CEO over there.
[02:10:08.588 --> 02:10:12.731]  I wanted to get him on because, well, they just mailed one to Jesse Ventura.
[02:10:12.731 --> 02:10:16.135]  He saw one at Willie Nelson's house and really wanted one when he was here.
[02:10:16.135 --> 02:10:17.476]  And he said, hey, I want one of those.
[02:10:17.476 --> 02:10:18.257]  How do I buy one?
[02:10:18.257 --> 02:10:22.220]  I just said, look, we'll just send you one from a Cola Blue and he just got his yesterday.
[02:10:24.542 --> 02:10:26.562]  It grabs water out of the atmosphere.
[02:10:26.562 --> 02:10:28.903]  That's what clouds are, for those that don't know.
[02:10:28.903 --> 02:10:31.183]  They are water vapor, and it's humidity.
[02:10:31.183 --> 02:10:36.164]  You know, like when you hear, humidity today, 65%, or it's a muggy, 80% humidity.
[02:10:36.164 --> 02:10:40.765]  In average humidity, you get seven and a half gallons a day, and that's with their smaller units.
[02:10:40.765 --> 02:10:42.086]  They have bigger ones if you want them.
[02:10:42.086 --> 02:10:48.607]  Computerized, but very simple, hot, cold water, how much water, what the humidity is, seven filters it goes through.
[02:10:48.607 --> 02:10:52.188]  I wanted to have him on for a few minutes to talk about the system,
[02:10:52.688 --> 02:10:54.770]  Thank you for having me again, Alex, and hello to all the listeners.
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:28.349]  I was listening to the show earlier and I thought, you know, how long can we last without water once this controlled grid gets implemented?
[02:11:28.349 --> 02:11:37.137]  And it's the time now to get ready, and get ready with water, with energy, with food.
[02:11:37.137 --> 02:11:44.604]  It's a very crucial and critical time to get the message out, and I'm glad that your show is a vehicle for doing that.
[02:11:46.374 --> 02:11:59.360]  Well, I'm just sitting here thinking of the control grid and things I haven't written down on these pages coming up, and I thought, oh, kill switches being built into all the cars, microphones and cameras on all the computers.
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:01.020]  There's no way to keep track of all of this.
[02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:02.681]  I mean, it's just getting too insane.
[02:12:02.681 --> 02:12:06.523]  Tell folks about the Acola Blue and how folks get it, and I know you're offering a discount today.
[02:12:07.108 --> 02:12:17.958]  Yeah, well the Cola Blue, as you said, it takes the humidity in the air and it condenses that humidity and makes drinking water out of the humidity in your air.
[02:12:17.958 --> 02:12:29.990]  It doesn't just grab the humidity and serve it up, it filters it through essentially seven filters, one reverse osmosis system, three
[02:12:30.795 --> 02:12:46.382]  Uh, activated carbon filters, and then one granular media that has like diatomaceous earth in it, which is sort of a way of straining out, you know, smaller
[02:12:48.779 --> 02:12:53.260]  Organisms and whatever might be in the atmosphere.
[02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:56.141]  So there's a filter made out of plankton skeletons.
[02:12:56.141 --> 02:12:58.162]  One of the best filters in the world.
[02:12:58.162 --> 02:12:59.362]  Right.
[02:12:59.362 --> 02:13:02.703]  And also we use the ultraviolet light.
[02:13:02.703 --> 02:13:08.184]  It has a 245 nanometer UV light in the upper storage tank.
[02:13:08.184 --> 02:13:12.145]  And we've recently added one to the lower storage tank as well.
[02:13:12.145 --> 02:13:14.506]  So there's two UV lights in there now.
[02:13:15.970 --> 02:13:21.813]  Some people say it's overkill, but when you taste the water, it certainly speaks for itself.
[02:13:21.813 --> 02:13:30.378]  And we just got a big shipment of them in, and if you want to order them for Father's Day or for just getting prepared,
[02:13:31.115 --> 02:13:32.936]  We do have a special today.
[02:13:32.936 --> 02:13:34.197]  Father's Day!
[02:13:34.197 --> 02:13:37.078]  Ooh, sounds like... Ooh, Al-Qaeda, better call it.
[02:13:37.078 --> 02:13:40.080]  Ooh, Fathers, Patriots, Founding Fathers.
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:42.961]  This is... Don't give anybody a Don't Tread on Me shirt for Father's Day.
[02:13:42.961 --> 02:13:44.982]  Don't give them a Nicola Blue.
[02:13:44.982 --> 02:13:45.383]  Absolutely.
[02:13:45.383 --> 02:13:46.323]  Tell folks about the special.
[02:13:46.323 --> 02:13:47.284]  I'm sorry I interrupted.
[02:13:47.284 --> 02:13:48.204]  That's okay.
[02:13:48.204 --> 02:13:49.785]  10% off plus free shipping.
[02:13:49.785 --> 02:13:52.546]  So, the shipping is $100 value and 10% off $13.50.
[02:13:52.546 --> 02:13:53.267]  So that's $1,215.
[02:14:00.137 --> 02:14:01.498]  You can get that by calling 800-691-6043.
[02:14:01.498 --> 02:14:01.698]  Again, 800-691-6043.
[02:14:01.698 --> 02:14:03.019]  That's 1-800-691-6043 or acolablue.com.
[02:14:03.019 --> 02:14:04.119]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[02:14:04.119 --> 02:14:04.539]  That's right.
[02:14:04.539 --> 02:14:09.062]  And promo code Alex Jones and we'll have this promo available until Friday, June 5th.
[02:14:09.062 --> 02:14:11.063]  So we hope people will call up and
[02:14:29.269 --> 02:14:40.256]  And get one for themselves or for their friends and family and let's get prepared because you can only last about three days without water.
[02:14:40.256 --> 02:14:49.542]  Well, I mean, plus, this is, even if you've got well water, a lot of wells are contaminated, some of them are great, but this is out of the atmosphere and then it goes through filters.
[02:14:49.542 --> 02:14:53.184]  You can't get clearer, you can't get purer, you can't get better tasting.
[02:14:53.184 --> 02:14:57.387]  This is just an amazing system and anybody that's used it gets completely addicted.
[02:14:57.927 --> 02:15:18.734]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, acolablue.com, or that phone number, one more time for folks, we'll put it up on screen, people at prisonplanet.tv, it's 1-800-691-6043, 1-800-691-6043, or ecoloblue.com, big links up on infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com.
[02:15:18.734 --> 02:15:24.516]  Not only is it one of the best deals out there on a high-quality atmospheric water generator, you're getting about, what it sounds like, about 20% off today,
[02:15:26.136 --> 02:15:28.017]  And they also are patriots.
[02:15:28.017 --> 02:15:31.198]  Turns out Tyler's been a listener for many, many years.
[02:15:31.198 --> 02:15:33.079]  Thank you so much, sir, for coming on the show with us.
[02:15:33.079 --> 02:15:33.719]  Thank you.
[02:15:33.719 --> 02:15:36.220]  And thank you to the listeners and everybody.
[02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:37.601]  Get prepared.
[02:15:37.601 --> 02:15:39.342]  And I'll speak to you soon, Alex.
[02:15:39.342 --> 02:15:39.662]  You bet.
[02:15:39.662 --> 02:15:40.222]  Take care.
[02:15:40.222 --> 02:15:40.642]  Thank you.
[02:15:40.642 --> 02:15:40.902]  All right.
[02:15:40.902 --> 02:15:44.884]  There goes our guest, Tyler Palmer, at ColaBlue.com.
[02:15:44.884 --> 02:15:52.027]  Let's take a few phone calls now, and then I'm preparing to get into the Cashless Society control grid.
[02:15:53.766 --> 02:15:55.907]  Hey Alex, my answer to that last caller is don't go to Walmart.
[02:15:55.907 --> 02:15:59.209]  I haven't been to Walmart in three years.
[02:16:16.465 --> 02:16:17.907]  But that's not what I called for.
[02:16:17.907 --> 02:16:18.287]  Correct.
[02:16:18.287 --> 02:16:20.469]  I'll wear my 9-11 t-shirt all the time and get funny looks.
[02:16:39.775 --> 02:16:40.916]  No, it's not.
[02:16:40.916 --> 02:16:45.760]  I'm a disabled Marine from the Vietnam conflict and also an ex-police officer.
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:46.601]  I've talked to you before.
[02:16:46.601 --> 02:16:49.583]  I used to live in Austin.
[02:16:49.583 --> 02:16:50.504]  I was waterboarded.
[02:16:50.504 --> 02:16:53.026]  I went to survival school.
[02:16:53.026 --> 02:17:03.355]  I was not only waterboarded, I was put in a box that was smaller than I was tall and beat on and taken out and put on a stool.
[02:17:03.355 --> 02:17:07.158]  My hands had my back and the stool was kicked out from under me.
[02:17:08.749 --> 02:17:11.650]  And don't do the water boring.
[02:17:11.650 --> 02:17:14.951]  I've had problems from that since 1971.
[02:17:14.951 --> 02:17:19.812]  I'm claustrophobic.
[02:17:19.812 --> 02:17:21.973]  I had always been a habit swimmer.
[02:17:21.973 --> 02:17:28.235]  Every time I get water up my nose, I have a, just a slight panic from that.
[02:17:28.235 --> 02:17:30.456]  And I'll advise you, don't do it.
[02:17:30.456 --> 02:17:31.896]  And take my word for it, it's torture.
[02:17:32.944 --> 02:17:40.890]  Well, I know it's torture, but I want to illustrate what it's like when somebody really... I want to see how... I'm guessing I can hold out about 30-45 seconds.
[02:17:40.890 --> 02:17:42.572]  We'll see if I can do it.
[02:17:42.572 --> 02:17:46.375]  And, uh... And if I can just turn my brain off, usually.
[02:17:46.375 --> 02:17:48.796]  I want to see how bad it really is.
[02:17:48.796 --> 02:17:50.878]  But I know it can cause physical damage.
[02:17:50.878 --> 02:17:55.342]  That's why the Chicago Police were trying to stop Eric Moller, man-cow, from doing it.
[02:17:55.342 --> 02:17:57.784]  You're saying it caused you health problems?
[02:17:57.784 --> 02:18:00.926]  Yes, it's caused... It's caused... Mostly the mental.
[02:18:00.926 --> 02:18:02.127]  I have PTSD, anyway.
[02:18:02.802 --> 02:18:12.391]  And, uh, but the waterboarding really bothered me more, the waterboarding and the rest of it, bothered me more than going to war.
[02:18:12.391 --> 02:18:23.041]  You know, I have more effects from the, from the, the survival school, but you gotta realize, 1971 Marine Corps boot camp, uh, at least every three days you was beat.
[02:18:23.041 --> 02:18:25.343]  Uh, they don't do that anymore, but they did when I went through.
[02:18:25.962 --> 02:18:38.028]  Yeah, I've talked to older Marines, they say they used to shoot at you, throw real hand grenades, beat people, people would die falling off ropes, and I guess they've lightened it up a bit.
[02:18:38.028 --> 02:18:50.354]  They was experts at hitting you in the solar plexus, taking the end of your bayonet while I was on your hip and jabbing it in your side, or just plain kicking you in the butt hard with the toe of their shoe, toe of their boot.
[02:18:51.838 --> 02:18:55.360]  And like I said, I was 18 years old when I went to that survival school.
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:57.961]  I was in top physical condition.
[02:18:57.961 --> 02:19:00.523]  Best physical condition I was ever in in my life.
[02:19:00.523 --> 02:19:02.204]  And it almost killed me.
[02:19:02.204 --> 02:19:05.565]  Well, Ventura said that they jump on your stomach too when they waterboard you.
[02:19:05.565 --> 02:19:06.986]  Do they do that to you?
[02:19:06.986 --> 02:19:07.827]  Yes.
[02:19:07.827 --> 02:19:08.687]  Yes.
[02:19:08.687 --> 02:19:10.408]  And you think you're dead.
[02:19:10.408 --> 02:19:11.048]  You think you're dead.
[02:19:11.048 --> 02:19:13.310]  I was also choked out.
[02:19:13.310 --> 02:19:15.611]  We did that in boot camp.
[02:19:15.611 --> 02:19:17.692]  You had your buddy behind you.
[02:19:17.692 --> 02:19:21.154]  You could not fight back and they actually choked you out until you passed out.
[02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:25.222]  Yeah, in high school a few times we did that as a game.
[02:19:25.222 --> 02:19:36.528]  The weird dreams you have, like in the 10 seconds you pass out, all the guys in there have been like, and I have these weird dreams, I go, the only problem is one time they let me go and I hit my head and busted it open.
[02:19:36.528 --> 02:19:38.249]  I'll tell you the crazy stuff that goes on.
[02:19:38.249 --> 02:19:40.170]  Well, I'd like to hear more of those stories sometime.
[02:19:40.170 --> 02:19:43.813]  I've got this big breakdown coming up, but Roger, we appreciate your call.
[02:19:43.813 --> 02:19:44.293]  God bless you.
[02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.951]  Take care.
[02:19:46.951 --> 02:19:51.093]  Alright, we're going to come back and talk to Todd, Rick, Julio, Chris, and others.
[02:19:51.093 --> 02:19:51.713]  Look, it's too late.
[02:19:51.713 --> 02:19:53.194]  I've already said I'm going to get waterboarded.
[02:19:53.194 --> 02:19:53.714]  It's going to happen.
[02:19:53.714 --> 02:19:57.276]  We've just got to figure out when, and how, and when.
[02:19:57.276 --> 02:19:58.497]  So that's all coming up as well.
[02:19:58.497 --> 02:20:01.159]  Put it live on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:20:01.159 --> 02:20:03.500]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:12.585]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[02:20:12.985 --> 02:20:21.014]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.

[02:20:28.302 --> 02:20:30.404]  506-5904.
[02:20:30.404 --> 02:20:35.467]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[02:20:35.467 --> 02:20:40.330]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.

[02:20:58.322 --> 02:21:01.624]  Call today.
[02:21:01.624 --> 02:21:07.428]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.428 --> 02:21:14.433]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:15.015 --> 02:21:21.597]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:21.597 --> 02:21:23.558]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:23.558 --> 02:21:26.059]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:26.059 --> 02:21:36.942]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:39.300]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.300 --> 02:21:41.161]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:21:41.161 --> 02:21:48.082]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:48.082 --> 02:21:56.344]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.344 --> 02:21:57.905]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:57.905 --> 02:21:59.105]  The people strike back.
[02:22:02.344 --> 02:22:03.485]  Spring is here.
[02:22:03.485 --> 02:22:04.445]  Growing season.
[02:22:04.445 --> 02:22:06.627]  The economy is not getting any better.
[02:22:06.627 --> 02:22:08.348]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:22:08.348 --> 02:22:09.329]  Think about it.
[02:22:09.329 --> 02:22:13.411]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:22:13.411 --> 02:22:17.114]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:22:17.114 --> 02:22:19.935]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[02:22:19.935 --> 02:22:31.803]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:22:32.123 --> 02:22:32.563]  Let's do it!
[02:23:00.689 --> 02:23:07.373]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:23:07.373 --> 02:23:15.479]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:23:15.479 --> 02:23:23.664]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:23:23.664 --> 02:23:28.407]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:23:28.727 --> 02:23:33.952]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:23:33.952 --> 02:23:38.317]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:23:38.317 --> 02:23:39.398]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:23:39.398 --> 02:23:43.902]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:23:43.902 --> 02:23:45.284]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:23:48.795 --> 02:23:51.796]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:23:51.796 --> 02:23:53.557]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:53.557 --> 02:23:53.997]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:53.997 --> 02:23:55.758]  He's pounding down, loaded up and trucking.
[02:23:55.758 --> 02:23:57.319]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[02:24:16.019 --> 02:24:20.662]  We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there.
[02:24:20.662 --> 02:24:22.824]  I'm eastbound just like no bandit runs.
[02:24:22.824 --> 02:24:27.527]  Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes.
[02:24:27.527 --> 02:24:31.990]  Let it all hang out, cause we got a run to make.
[02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:36.473]  The boys are thirsty in Atlanta, and there's beer in Texarkana.
[02:24:44.244 --> 02:24:50.446]  Okay, for the next 40 minutes, I'm going to break down the Cash Flow Society program.
[02:24:50.446 --> 02:24:53.327]  Then, Webster Griffin Tarpen is going to join us.
[02:24:53.327 --> 02:24:58.229]  We'll continue with Open Phones as well.
[02:24:58.229 --> 02:25:05.772]  Now understand, as bad as this is going to sound, this is not one one-hundredth of the knowledge that I'm aware of.
[02:25:05.772 --> 02:25:08.113]  And I'm probably not aware of half of what's going on.
[02:25:10.367 --> 02:25:13.496]  The more I learn, the less I know that I know.
[02:25:13.496 --> 02:25:18.289]  It just always gets worse, always gets crazier than we had first broken down.
[02:25:20.905 --> 02:25:36.054]  Now remember, I had gotten on the air 13 years ago with the Telecommunications Act of 96 and said they're turning all the major telecommunications and cyber systems that are private with $9 billion of federal money into giant wiretaps.
[02:25:36.054 --> 02:25:39.557]  It was admitted it was designed for the feds to cull through it without wiretaps.
[02:25:39.557 --> 02:25:41.858]  That was debated in Congress.
[02:25:41.858 --> 02:25:47.401]  And then I would have listeners call in and say there's no such thing as the NSA, there's no such thing as Echelon.
[02:25:47.401 --> 02:25:49.643]  Remember in the mid-90s it didn't exist?
[02:25:54.022 --> 02:25:57.967]  So, let's throw that Mother Jones article up first.
[02:25:57.967 --> 02:25:59.910]  Should Obama control the internet?
[02:25:59.910 --> 02:26:06.318]  And if you scroll down on the article, they have the quotes by Jay Rockefeller and Senator Olympia Snowe as well.
[02:26:07.915 --> 02:26:13.802]  Saying, should President Obama have the power to shut down the domestic internet traffic during a state of emergency?
[02:26:13.802 --> 02:26:20.150]  Senators John Rockefeller, that goes by Jay, and Olympia Snowe, Senators, think so.
[02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:25.437]  And that's the bill that Obama has executive signed in as an executive order.
[02:26:25.437 --> 02:26:26.839]  This is the accompanying bill.
[02:26:28.154 --> 02:26:32.057]  Now, that's just to head off one small part of this larger story.
[02:26:32.057 --> 02:26:33.558]  People are in denial.
[02:26:33.558 --> 02:26:42.866]  This story posted at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, a detailed analysis by Paul Watson that gives you a wide spectrum view of what's happening.
[02:26:42.866 --> 02:26:47.149]  People are all over both websites commenting, saying, we're making it up.
[02:26:47.149 --> 02:26:49.591]  There's no way to shut down the Internet.
[02:26:49.591 --> 02:26:54.896]  Well, the stated goal of the Pentagon and the Cyber Command is to do just that.
[02:26:54.896 --> 02:26:57.678]  And the head of cyber security
[02:26:59.133 --> 02:27:10.199]  Quit in March, Cyber Security Chief resigns amid turf battle, in a blunt letter Rod Bergstrom cited clash with National Security Agency.
[02:27:10.199 --> 02:27:11.860]  So they act like it's a turf battle.
[02:27:11.860 --> 02:27:21.285]  When you actually read what he had to say, he says, a threat to our democracy with the Pentagon taking over all private Internet activity in the United States.
[02:27:21.285 --> 02:27:25.408]  In a blunt letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Bergstrom
[02:27:26.704 --> 02:27:33.628]  Complained about a shortage of money for the center and clash over whether the National Security Agency should control cyber efforts.
[02:27:33.628 --> 02:27:40.093]  The role of the NSA in protecting domestic computer networks has triggered debate, particularly among privacy and civil libertarians groups.
[02:27:40.093 --> 02:27:42.574]  So this is kind of an MSNBC whitewash.
[02:27:42.574 --> 02:27:45.136]  You pull up the other articles, you can actually read him saying.
[02:27:45.136 --> 02:27:46.957]  In fact, I want that on screen.
[02:27:46.957 --> 02:27:47.978]  I meant to have that article.
[02:27:47.978 --> 02:27:52.881]  Just Google, head of cyber security resigns, says threat to democracy.
[02:27:52.881 --> 02:27:54.542]  I want folks to see that.
[02:27:54.542 --> 02:27:55.763]  In case there's any denial out there.
[02:27:56.556 --> 02:28:07.097]  So, that said, let me just read over the four pages of notes that I've boiled this down to of different control grid points.
[02:28:08.291 --> 02:28:17.218]  The Cashless Society surveillance grid to control mobility and purchasing and to track and trace all you buy, sell and do.
[02:28:17.218 --> 02:28:18.580]  Track all your internet activity.
[02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:20.161]  Track all your private activity.
[02:28:20.161 --> 02:28:23.484]  Track your car everywhere you drive by scanning and reading your license plate.
[02:28:23.484 --> 02:28:27.066]  That's now nationwide in the US, all over Europe, all over England.
[02:28:27.066 --> 02:28:29.028]  It's a global treaty.
[02:28:29.028 --> 02:28:31.850]  It's all integrated in global databases under treaties.
[02:28:32.691 --> 02:28:33.432]  I want to go over that.
[02:28:33.432 --> 02:28:33.873]  Yeah, U.S.
[02:28:33.873 --> 02:28:38.058]  Cybersecurity Chief quits over NSA power grab, the register.
[02:28:38.058 --> 02:28:38.258]  U.S.
[02:28:38.258 --> 02:28:46.569]  Government Cybersecurity Chief abruptly quit last week amid allegations his office was woefully underfunded and
[02:28:49.827 --> 02:28:54.070]  "...and unduly controlled by the country's ultra-secretive National Security Agency."
[02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:57.973]  And he goes on to say that it is a threat to our freedoms.
[02:28:57.973 --> 02:29:01.375]  So yeah, that's got his actual quotes from his letter right there out of the register.
[02:29:01.375 --> 02:29:03.977]  I was trying to read it across the room and couldn't.
[02:29:03.977 --> 02:29:08.560]  I had to look over here.
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:13.784]  So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to go over, this was a quick segment, a long segment coming up, I'm going to break down
[02:29:14.824 --> 02:29:17.426]  These different points and tie it all together.
[02:29:17.426 --> 02:29:21.550]  And MIT, the Pentagon, the UN, it's all stated.
[02:29:21.550 --> 02:29:23.472]  Internet, too, which is a consortium.
[02:29:23.472 --> 02:29:25.634]  Everything you're going to hear here is on record.
[02:29:25.634 --> 02:29:28.416]  This is what they admit.
[02:29:28.416 --> 02:29:34.261]  Can you imagine what we don't know?
[02:29:34.261 --> 02:29:38.705]  Can you imagine what we're not being told?
[02:29:38.705 --> 02:29:41.407]  So we will go over all of it.
[02:29:42.506 --> 02:29:51.749]  On the other side of this quick break right here on the GCN Radio Network, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:51.749 --> 02:29:55.651]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.651 --> 02:30:01.132]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.132 --> 02:30:02.813]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.813 --> 02:30:07.575]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:30:07.575 --> 02:30:08.595]  We need to be independent.
[02:30:13.567 --> 02:30:17.368]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[02:30:17.368 --> 02:30:22.890]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:30:22.890 --> 02:30:30.893]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half
[02:30:30.913 --> 02:30:31.313]  We're good.

[02:32:02.068 --> 02:32:11.177]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[02:32:11.177 --> 02:32:16.341]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[02:32:16.341 --> 02:32:18.924]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[02:32:19.144 --> 02:32:19.745]  We're good to go!
[02:32:38.618 --> 02:32:39.579]  We're good to go.
[02:33:07.529 --> 02:33:13.093]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[02:33:13.093 --> 02:33:18.597]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[02:33:18.597 --> 02:33:23.100]  I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:32.645]  Alright, there's two key points I want to make and then I'm going to launch into the details.
[02:33:32.645 --> 02:33:33.386]  And that's this.
[02:33:41.778 --> 02:33:46.623]  Through international treaties in 2000 is one they had in Australia.
[02:33:46.623 --> 02:33:56.213]  We already have a world ID agreed upon standardization of the type of digital photo, the type of biometrics, the type of fingerprints biometrically.
[02:33:57.074 --> 02:33:59.477]  Through the treaty, we already have a world ID system.
[02:33:59.477 --> 02:34:14.692]  That's why Germany and England and Japan, when the United States makes people entering it biometrically scanned, the very same companies, the very same systems are contracted to put in those grids in other parts of the world.
[02:34:14.692 --> 02:34:17.295]  So, this is internationally standardized.
[02:34:19.071 --> 02:34:28.739]  And all the things you see that individually are horrible tyranny are all openly set up by think tanks, openly rolled out and taught in the universities.
[02:34:28.739 --> 02:34:34.203]  Most of the big grants and the people that are getting their tuition paid for with scholarships now.
[02:34:34.203 --> 02:34:45.451]  The biggest growth industry isn't just law enforcement, but it's homeland security, data mining, and total information awareness network, and Patriot Act compliance.
[02:34:45.451 --> 02:34:47.453]  So this is all in the industry publications.
[02:34:48.228 --> 02:34:49.769]  It's a big joke to them.
[02:34:49.769 --> 02:35:03.416]  Everything you buy, everything you sell, everything you do, everything you believe, everywhere you surf, everything you do, as the New York Times bragged years ago, dealing with the Total Information Awareness Network, is now being integrated and tracked.
[02:35:03.416 --> 02:35:06.238]  So you can forget trying to hide out and not be in their system.
[02:35:06.238 --> 02:35:08.779]  The answer is bring the criminals to justice.
[02:35:08.779 --> 02:35:12.261]  Bring the bankers that are destroying the dollar and our sovereignty to justice.
[02:35:12.261 --> 02:35:13.182]  I'm going to cover that next hour.
[02:35:14.534 --> 02:35:21.096]  Now, thinking about this show for the last week, the reason I keep holding off doing it is because there is so much data.
[02:35:21.096 --> 02:35:21.997]  So I just want to make that point.
[02:35:21.997 --> 02:35:23.517]  This is full of notes on it.
[02:35:23.517 --> 02:35:27.058]  These are just notes off those notes that I wrote today, trying to boil it down.
[02:35:27.058 --> 02:35:30.060]  Let me just go over these.
[02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:39.283]  This is an opting in to the matrix is what's happening right now, where Google announces, oh, we have a new system we're using now for four years, where the cameras and
[02:35:40.362 --> 02:35:43.183]  Microphones built into all the new computers.
[02:35:43.183 --> 02:35:49.066]  We have a AI software listening to every word you say, what you do, watching you.
[02:35:49.066 --> 02:35:57.249]  If your dog's barking, then Google ads for dogs and dog food and dog toys and dog medicine and heartworm medicine pops up on screen.
[02:35:57.249 --> 02:35:58.669]  That was the example they used.
[02:35:58.669 --> 02:36:08.814]  Or if we hear you watching a particular show or see it off the computer camera, we will then advertise products that go along with that psychological algorithm, that personality type.
[02:36:08.814 --> 02:36:09.714]  This is announced.
[02:36:11.789 --> 02:36:12.811]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[02:36:12.811 --> 02:36:14.494]  Punch it up on screen.
[02:36:14.494 --> 02:36:20.384]  Google using cameras and microphones to track computer users.
[02:36:20.384 --> 02:36:22.207]  I think that was the Prison Planet headline.
[02:36:22.207 --> 02:36:24.330]  And then we've got links to Google's press release.
[02:36:26.411 --> 02:36:30.033]  I mean, they're bragging about this, and other companies are doing it.
[02:36:30.033 --> 02:36:42.879]  TiVo, remember the Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction with her breasts coming out in the Super Bowl, that staged event, as staged as the barat guy, you know, falling on Eminem at the MTV Awards.
[02:36:42.879 --> 02:36:44.540]  I told you that was staged, now they admit it's staged.
[02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:46.300]  I mean, come on, it's all staged, folks.
[02:36:46.300 --> 02:36:47.161]  Quit being so gullible.
[02:36:49.161 --> 02:36:53.543]  Tivo came out and said, oh, we had 2.2 million rewinds and replays.
[02:36:53.543 --> 02:36:57.905]  And the Chicago Tribune said, but I'd always been saying, you mean that's a two-way system?
[02:36:57.905 --> 02:36:58.905]  You're tracking what they do?
[02:36:58.905 --> 02:37:01.146]  And they said, yeah.
[02:37:01.146 --> 02:37:03.127]  See, there's thousands of these examples.
[02:37:03.127 --> 02:37:04.788]  So you're opting into the matrix.
[02:37:08.029 --> 02:37:08.529]  We're good to go.
[02:37:30.166 --> 02:37:33.948]  This, you scan with a camera on it, your body, your biometrics.
[02:37:33.948 --> 02:37:36.330]  You turn forward, sideways, and backwards.
[02:37:36.330 --> 02:37:38.771]  Your 360 body is now scanned.
[02:37:38.771 --> 02:37:40.412]  Two-way, the feds are in it.
[02:37:40.412 --> 02:37:43.734]  This is, Microsoft is the feds, just like IBM.
[02:37:43.734 --> 02:37:45.115]  On record, in-game covers it.
[02:37:45.115 --> 02:37:46.036]  It's now declassified.
[02:37:46.789 --> 02:37:49.532]  We covered it two years ago, it's now mainstream news.
[02:37:49.532 --> 02:38:01.246]  But I know people high-level, two different people, but one super high-level in the involvement with the development of all this, and this is literally meant to mesmerize, to lower your brainwaves, to put you into a trance.
[02:38:01.246 --> 02:38:04.690]  Television already does it, but this is to bring you to the next level.
[02:38:04.690 --> 02:38:05.391]  This is the
[02:38:06.616 --> 02:38:08.477]  Opting into the matrix.
[02:38:08.477 --> 02:38:10.518]  Notice the kids when you see them at restaurants.
[02:38:10.518 --> 02:38:11.559]  They're not talking to their parents.
[02:38:11.559 --> 02:38:12.619]  They're texting.
[02:38:12.619 --> 02:38:14.240]  They watch four or five hours of TV a day.
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:15.781]  Two or three hours of video games.
[02:38:15.781 --> 02:38:17.782]  They won't talk to their friends across the table.
[02:38:17.782 --> 02:38:19.383]  They're texting to them.
[02:38:19.383 --> 02:38:21.384]  They're not having language anymore.
[02:38:21.384 --> 02:38:24.086]  That's a major British study about all this media.
[02:38:24.086 --> 02:38:25.487]  People don't have language anymore.
[02:38:25.487 --> 02:38:29.089]  The language is being reduced down where you can't talk to people.
[02:38:31.658 --> 02:38:33.259]  So we're being sucked into the matrix.
[02:38:33.259 --> 02:38:41.365]  The TV screen is a lens on which projects through the eyes, which are brain stems, literally windows into the soul, interfacing.
[02:38:41.365 --> 02:38:45.128]  And so we're being mesmerized, being sucked into the crystal ball.
[02:38:45.128 --> 02:38:46.409]  That's how they liken it.
[02:38:46.409 --> 02:38:49.972]  So people are opting into the matrix, being sucked in.
[02:38:51.087 --> 02:39:05.292]  Thirty, forty years ago, writers talked about how you'd live in Manhattan, or Houston, or wherever, and you'd see high-rise buildings with people fighting, and people playing pool, and people gambling, or people having sex, or people reading, or people laughing.
[02:39:07.105 --> 02:39:12.007]  Now, you look at high-rise buildings, and it's nothing but blue glow at night.
[02:39:12.007 --> 02:39:13.828]  No one's talking, no one's living.
[02:39:13.828 --> 02:39:15.168]  The TV is the life.
[02:39:15.168 --> 02:39:17.729]  It's teaching you how to tattle on your neighbors.
[02:39:17.729 --> 02:39:19.610]  It's teaching you you're fat and inadequate.
[02:39:19.610 --> 02:39:22.952]  It's teaching you that cops tasering you are good, and the second of them it's bad.
[02:39:22.952 --> 02:39:26.093]  It's all messages, all brainwashing, that torture is good.
[02:39:26.974 --> 02:39:29.075]  That vaccines are good.
[02:39:29.075 --> 02:39:36.077]  You're opting in and it's made to be comfortable and funny and goofy and your choices and your favorites.
[02:39:36.077 --> 02:39:39.337]  This is the control system.
[02:39:39.337 --> 02:39:43.779]  Let me see, I've covered point one of all these pages.
[02:39:43.779 --> 02:39:49.020]  Will we ever get to it?
[02:39:49.020 --> 02:39:51.761]  So you're opting into the matrix, but are you really opting in?
[02:39:52.637 --> 02:40:00.524]  It's kind of like you opt in to go down to the river's edge to drink some water as a primitive man and a big crocodile grabs you and drags you in and eats you.
[02:40:00.524 --> 02:40:02.906]  You opted in to go get water that looked good.
[02:40:02.906 --> 02:40:04.828]  You didn't see those two eyes right there.
[02:40:04.828 --> 02:40:07.150]  I'm telling you, there's crocodiles down there.
[02:40:07.150 --> 02:40:11.534]  I'm telling you out here in the hill country, if you buy a house in the country, watch out for rattlesnakes.
[02:40:11.534 --> 02:40:13.616]  The realtors won't tell you about it.
[02:40:13.616 --> 02:40:14.296]  That's what I do.
[02:40:14.296 --> 02:40:17.840]  I warn my fellow humans because I have a tribal love of humanity.
[02:40:18.786 --> 02:40:27.052]  But see, the marketers, they love the fact that they're lying there in the water's edge with just their eyes and the tip of their nose popped up.
[02:40:27.052 --> 02:40:28.633]  So you think you're going into something fun.
[02:40:28.633 --> 02:40:34.257]  This is a scientific Pentagon assault on you and your family.
[02:40:34.257 --> 02:40:39.461]  So the control grid is a technological enslavement
[02:40:40.401 --> 02:40:41.601]  It's a paradigm.
[02:40:41.601 --> 02:40:46.563]  And it's all standardized, all controlled, always being honed, being implemented in phases.
[02:40:46.563 --> 02:40:51.104]  This is all stated by Internet2 and RAND Corporation documents and MIT.
[02:40:51.104 --> 02:40:54.164]  They're all on record bragging about it.
[02:40:54.164 --> 02:40:55.265]  They're on power trips.
[02:40:55.265 --> 02:41:07.668]  There's these arrogant technocrats and there's psychologists, psychiatrists, controllers above them and then the elites who make the decisions who are very proud of how dumb the public is and how they've dumbed the public down further and how they use every human instinct.
[02:41:08.427 --> 02:41:12.447]  To manipulate us and every human instinct against us to control us.
[02:41:15.546 --> 02:41:25.395]  Now, the end game of this is to have the false culture of the television and the different niche groups they're targeting integrate and then manifest on the ground.
[02:41:25.395 --> 02:41:35.685]  To have the delusions, the disinformation, and the paranoia, and the lies manifest in the real three-dimensional world, not the two-dimensional television.
[02:41:35.685 --> 02:41:39.028]  That's why they're coming ahead with every major production firm
[02:41:40.578 --> 02:41:53.789]  Industrial Light and Magic, DreamWorks, the group headed up by James Cameron to go to holograms and now they're introducing holograms on CNN to make the unreality even more real.
[02:41:53.789 --> 02:41:57.592]  So they want to highly control mobility.
[02:41:57.592 --> 02:42:01.215]  Mobility by having you watch TV instead of go play basketball.
[02:42:01.215 --> 02:42:06.319]  Mobility instead of having you spend time reading history books to your children so you'll watch your show, they watch their show.
[02:42:07.156 --> 02:42:14.843]  Mobility, where you've got to have all the trinkets and crap so you're in debt to buy all the little trinkets they sell and all the gadgetry which controls you further.
[02:42:14.843 --> 02:42:21.308]  By federal law, all the cell phones track you down to a few feet with GPS triangulators off the cell towers.
[02:42:21.308 --> 02:42:25.832]  By law, they can listen to you even without a warrant and even when the phone is turned off.
[02:42:25.832 --> 02:42:28.334]  I told you that 12 years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[02:42:28.334 --> 02:42:30.416]  I just point out, don't be in denial anymore.
[02:42:30.816 --> 02:42:32.417]  Remember all the things I talked about?
[02:42:32.417 --> 02:42:36.461]  We gotta just get all the hundreds of old shows, video shows, TV shows, I didn't put them on the web.
[02:42:36.461 --> 02:42:42.986]  Some folks are doing that, but if you've got my shows, you watched me on Austin for years, just put them on the web, folks.
[02:42:42.986 --> 02:42:52.675]  Because slaves today have been incrementally taught to believe this and go along with it, but if they can see somebody telling them exactly what would happen 10, 12, 13, 14 years before, that has an effect on them.
[02:42:54.935 --> 02:42:58.917]  They sell you the image that guns are illegal through television.
[02:42:58.917 --> 02:43:05.961]  This is just one example of hundreds where everything is based in Chicago, LA, or New York where they have highly restricted gun laws.
[02:43:05.961 --> 02:43:10.664]  So these dramas and cop shows are based there where people go to jail for having a gun.
[02:43:10.664 --> 02:43:12.865]  On these cop shows, the carpet cleaner sees a gun.
[02:43:14.249 --> 02:43:16.250]  In the New York apartment, he calls the cops.
[02:43:16.250 --> 02:43:17.911]  Turns out the guy's a child molester.
[02:43:17.911 --> 02:43:19.572]  He deserves to have his gun taken.
[02:43:19.572 --> 02:43:22.254]  If you're a gun owner, you're a child molester is the message.
[02:43:22.254 --> 02:43:26.057]  And people are always right to call the cops on people and are heroes.
[02:43:26.057 --> 02:43:34.922]  And so somebody in Austin, Texas watches that show, NYPD, Blue, and all those other shows, and then now they call the cops on you when they see a gun case.
[02:43:34.922 --> 02:43:37.104]  Because they think guns are illegal.
[02:43:37.104 --> 02:43:38.345]  They think TV's real.
[02:43:39.444 --> 02:43:43.047]  One example, one small microcosm, and there's other ways that they do that.
[02:43:43.047 --> 02:43:48.812]  You know, the guy's a child molester, he owns guns, he also beats his wife, and he's ugly.
[02:43:48.812 --> 02:43:49.673]  You don't want guns.
[02:43:49.673 --> 02:43:50.574]  You don't want to be him.
[02:43:50.574 --> 02:44:00.523]  The sharp, good-looking, young cop, she's gonna get him, and, you know, she sits there and tortures him to get the answers to save the kids, and, you know, thank God that person ratted him out that they had a gun.
[02:44:00.523 --> 02:44:02.424]  You know, it's just every, oh, yeah.
[02:44:02.424 --> 02:44:06.168]  See, it's just all for these weak-minded people to suck him into this.
[02:44:11.141 --> 02:44:20.008]  So they want to control your mobility with face scanning cameras and DMVs and everybody, car rentals, hotels, to get a job, to buy alcohol.
[02:44:20.008 --> 02:44:22.209]  Now to use a credit card, they want to see your ID.
[02:44:22.209 --> 02:44:23.450]  Now they're swiping it.
[02:44:23.450 --> 02:44:35.019]  They have big consortium meetings saying they're getting people ready to thumb scan and biometrically face scan to buy and sell for identity theft because they know there's cybersecurity rules and digitization of everything actually creates more of the theft.
[02:44:35.019 --> 02:44:36.400]  The government even admits that.
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:39.222]  But again, it creates more of a crisis to offer more of their solution.
[02:44:41.147 --> 02:44:43.851]  And so they glorify all these tattletale squads.
[02:44:43.851 --> 02:44:47.856]  And you heard the guy earlier, and I've even seen their own documents, were Walmart and Target.
[02:44:47.856 --> 02:44:50.179]  Target really is another Pentagon front company.
[02:44:50.179 --> 02:44:54.485]  Their main business is actually security, surveillance cameras, data mining.
[02:44:54.485 --> 02:44:57.909]  Target stores only one part of their division out of Minnesota.
[02:44:57.909 --> 02:44:58.810]  It's a Pentagon front.
[02:44:59.591 --> 02:45:05.900]  And they admit they're watching you and if you grab your kid by the arm in the store, you'll wonder why cops are there and CPS is there five minutes later.
[02:45:05.900 --> 02:45:07.622]  They also get kickbacks of that money.
[02:45:07.622 --> 02:45:09.845]  Target gets a lot of money, so does Walmart.
[02:45:09.845 --> 02:45:12.869]  One of their main profit centers is that.
[02:45:12.869 --> 02:45:15.793]  The USA Today reported four years ago,
[02:45:16.394 --> 02:45:19.736]  That headline, scofflaws get caught ordering pizzas.
[02:45:19.736 --> 02:45:22.258]  The big three pizza companies that have over half the U.S.
[02:45:22.258 --> 02:45:26.861]  market and more were joining it at the time through a private Dallas consortium.
[02:45:26.861 --> 02:45:39.570]  Again, the globalists always privatize all their data mining and police state for their companies that nexus in with government so the private people out of government can then go into private industry and actually make money off the police state grid mandated by government.
[02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:54.978]  And the thing was that whenever you call to get a pizza, they know that's your real address and your real name, so when they're running your credit card name, that's run through a NCIC criminal police database, so instead of a pizza, you get a SWAT team.
[02:45:54.978 --> 02:45:56.959]  Now that was four years ago.
[02:45:56.959 --> 02:46:01.661]  And they said they've been doing it for three years before that, so that's seven years they've been doing that.
[02:46:01.661 --> 02:46:04.523]  You starting to understand the control grid here, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:46:04.523 --> 02:46:08.485]  Hoosiers in there going, whoa, yeah, Google, uh, scofflaws ordering pizza.
[02:46:09.431 --> 02:46:12.233]  And then you'll get USA Today, and it'll explain.
[02:46:12.233 --> 02:46:15.755]  And that's just one I plug a lot every few months so people can look at that.
[02:46:15.755 --> 02:46:19.417]  I think that's particularly egregious for folks to understand it.
[02:46:19.417 --> 02:46:20.918]  Okay.
[02:46:20.918 --> 02:46:25.281]  When you buy stuff at Valero gas stations, they run your card for beer or cigarettes.
[02:46:25.281 --> 02:46:27.742]  They're going to phase it in everywhere for all products.
[02:46:27.742 --> 02:46:30.224]  That's run through a database.
[02:46:30.224 --> 02:46:30.864]  Everything, folks.
[02:46:30.864 --> 02:46:32.305]  It's all... Yeah, there it is.
[02:46:32.305 --> 02:46:35.087]  Missouri tracks scoff laws via pizza delivery databases.
[02:46:36.067 --> 02:46:40.233]  And that's just an article about... I notice they always talk about it with one state.
[02:46:40.233 --> 02:46:42.636]  To make people not get alarmed, Nationwide introduced it.
[02:46:42.636 --> 02:46:44.739]  This is Nationwide, you learn in the article.
[02:46:44.739 --> 02:46:47.283]  But to introduce it as it's only one area, and not...
[02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:50.162]  That's AP and that was 2004, four and a half years ago.
[02:47:17.551 --> 02:47:19.372]  There you have it.
[02:47:19.372 --> 02:47:20.493]  And again, there's thousands of this.
[02:47:20.493 --> 02:47:22.374]  It's just everything totally integrated.
[02:47:22.374 --> 02:47:24.775]  They admit it, not even me, connecting the dots.
[02:47:24.775 --> 02:47:26.236]  It's all stated.
[02:47:26.236 --> 02:47:33.820]  And once the full grid's in place, you have more than one kid, they're gonna come CPS the kid when it's born, or abort him and blow your head off the next time.
[02:47:33.820 --> 02:47:36.622]  And they got devil dog cops ready to rock.
[02:47:36.622 --> 02:47:38.823]  I mean, it's just total hell is upon you, folks.
[02:47:38.823 --> 02:47:40.624]  You need to know that.
[02:47:40.624 --> 02:47:43.106]  The churches are gonna tell you, lay down, that's the end of the world.
[02:47:43.106 --> 02:47:46.668]  But everybody's gonna be here while this is happening, thinking it's the end of the world, laying down.
[02:47:49.980 --> 02:47:53.641]  Now, remember, again, I told you this 13 years ago.
[02:47:53.641 --> 02:48:00.744]  I had state reps on 10 years ago, federal reps on six, seven years ago, and now it's been declassified.
[02:48:00.744 --> 02:48:11.548]  It's been all over the news that for 36 years, worldwide, in every IMF World Bank-controlled country, from Russia to Australia to England to the United States to Germany, blood is taken at birth.
[02:48:11.548 --> 02:48:15.349]  For 36 years, globally, it started in an international secret agreement.
[02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:18.030]  Blood is taken and put in a DNA database
[02:48:18.670 --> 02:48:26.313]  And is sold to private biotech companies who then license and register your DNA type.
[02:48:26.313 --> 02:48:29.854]  So when you want gene therapy later, you got to pay them for your own blood.
[02:48:29.854 --> 02:48:32.555]  It's also used so they can frame you with the blood they take.
[02:48:32.555 --> 02:48:34.475]  It's also used so they can track you.
[02:48:34.475 --> 02:48:38.737]  And so they can make race-specific bioweapons for you individually if they want.
[02:48:38.737 --> 02:48:45.019]  And they now admit for at least 10 years, they have laboratories that in one day can make a bioweapon which will only kill you.
[02:48:48.374 --> 02:48:55.677]  Or down to any sub-derivation or somebody that's 10% African from a certain area of Africa, and a mix of Native American, they can kill you.
[02:48:55.677 --> 02:48:57.217]  Anything they want, they can kill you.
[02:48:57.217 --> 02:48:57.877]  They already have it.
[02:48:57.877 --> 02:49:01.939]  This is total, full-spectrum dominance, New World Order style.
[02:49:01.939 --> 02:49:03.019]  This is what they brag about.
[02:49:03.019 --> 02:49:04.480]  It's why it's so funny to them.
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:08.881]  They're gonna orderly put in the control grid, and then they're just gonna start the slaughtering.
[02:49:08.881 --> 02:49:13.463]  All the killing and cancer you've seen so far is just the beginning of the soft-kill operation.
[02:49:13.463 --> 02:49:15.884]  Most of the cops, military listening, you're already dead.
[02:49:15.884 --> 02:49:16.804]  They've already implanted you.
[02:49:17.464 --> 02:49:27.766]  I mean, with the cancer viruses, which are hormonally, have hormonal fluctuation triggers, where when you have a certain hormonal fluctuation, on average around retirement, you'll be dead.
[02:49:27.766 --> 02:49:28.706]  And I'm sorry they murdered you.
[02:49:28.706 --> 02:49:30.146]  I'm sorry they murdered most of us.
[02:49:30.146 --> 02:49:37.488]  But before we die from their soft kill attack, now that we're aware of it, we can do damage to them and save others, and keep this iron grip from being able to make it all the way through.
[02:49:37.488 --> 02:49:42.289]  Okay, I've gotten to point four of about a hundred.
[02:49:42.289 --> 02:49:44.009]  And I'm telling you folks, it just goes on and on.
[02:49:45.912 --> 02:49:51.097]  DNA Medical Mafia, telling you it's the law, you gotta take shots.
[02:49:51.097 --> 02:49:55.201]  Now saying 60 plus shots are mandatory from just 10, when they're not mandatory.
[02:49:55.201 --> 02:49:58.064]  Trying to force injections on everybody.
[02:49:58.064 --> 02:50:00.786]  When you go in to have a baby, they say, do you have enough money?
[02:50:00.786 --> 02:50:02.728]  Is your husband mean to you?
[02:50:02.728 --> 02:50:07.072]  They ask the husband to leave the room, and they're entering into the health department database.
[02:50:07.072 --> 02:50:08.053]  Everybody's a spy.
[02:50:08.934 --> 02:50:11.815]  The census is now going to be yearly and then monthly.
[02:50:11.815 --> 02:50:12.936]  The Feds have announced it.
[02:50:12.936 --> 02:50:17.798]  They're getting GPS of your door, coming to your house and threatening you if you don't answer hundreds of questions.
[02:50:17.798 --> 02:50:19.739]  Totally a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
[02:50:19.739 --> 02:50:20.540]  Total tyranny.
[02:50:20.540 --> 02:50:25.322]  They admit it's for drones, police, and federal police to know right where your doorstep is.
[02:50:25.322 --> 02:50:28.904]  Under law, they want to make you monthly answer questions.
[02:50:28.904 --> 02:50:31.605]  Total police state.
[02:50:31.605 --> 02:50:36.167]  The Department of Homeland Security reports where they... How am I going to cover all this?
[02:50:36.167 --> 02:50:37.328]  I've got Webster Tarpley coming up.
[02:50:40.916 --> 02:50:42.837]  I could do this in three or four parts, I guess.
[02:50:42.837 --> 02:50:48.198]  I mean, folks, I haven't even... I haven't even gotten into it yet.
[02:50:48.198 --> 02:50:51.939]  I... It's just... I mean, believe me, everything I'm saying is on record.
[02:50:51.939 --> 02:50:55.220]  It's... I haven't even scratched the surface of the slave grid.
[02:50:55.220 --> 02:50:59.341]  You understand, they're killing all of us, including those of you that serve them.
[02:50:59.341 --> 02:51:01.542]  Don't laugh, it's real, and you know it is in your gut.
[02:51:01.542 --> 02:51:08.284]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[02:51:08.624 --> 02:51:24.522]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[02:51:24.842 --> 02:51:30.207]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[02:51:30.207 --> 02:51:36.713]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[02:51:36.713 --> 02:51:40.617]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[02:51:40.617 --> 02:51:43.300]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:48.665]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[02:51:48.985 --> 02:51:53.868]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to MySolarBackup.com.
[02:51:53.868 --> 02:51:56.370]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:51:56.370 --> 02:52:01.252]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[02:52:01.252 --> 02:52:02.793]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:52:02.793 --> 02:52:08.157]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[02:52:08.157 --> 02:52:10.578]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[02:52:10.578 --> 02:52:17.602]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by
[02:52:18.783 --> 02:52:19.083]  We're good.
[02:52:36.887 --> 02:52:37.568]  We're good to go.
[02:53:01.505 --> 02:53:03.486]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:53:03.486 --> 02:53:10.451]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:53:10.451 --> 02:53:18.857]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:18.857 --> 02:53:24.581]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:53:24.981 --> 02:53:26.583]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:53:26.583 --> 02:53:28.785]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:53:28.785 --> 02:53:33.310]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:33.310 --> 02:53:35.532]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:53:35.532 --> 02:53:43.300]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:53:43.720 --> 02:53:44.101]  We're good.
[02:54:07.310 --> 02:54:10.572]  Okay, we got Tarpley coming up eight minutes into the next hour.
[02:54:10.572 --> 02:54:13.333]  I want to cover some financial news here in a moment.
[02:54:13.333 --> 02:54:23.478]  I'm going to have to do part two on this tomorrow of the Casual Society Control Group and then we can post it up at PrisonPlanet.tv and the YouTube channel and the rest of the places out there.
[02:54:23.478 --> 02:54:27.681]  Let me just give you some of the other points that we'll be getting into tomorrow on this.
[02:54:27.681 --> 02:54:31.623]  We'll do this in parts.
[02:54:31.623 --> 02:54:32.123]  This is the
[02:54:33.866 --> 02:54:44.210]  Opting into the matrix, the control grid, the tech system, the tattletale squads to control mobility, to control where you can go, what you can do.
[02:54:44.210 --> 02:54:46.491]  They're gonna use the carbon tax to do that as well.
[02:54:46.491 --> 02:54:48.492]  No non-essential travel.
[02:54:49.557 --> 02:54:51.338]  All these new taxes and regulations.
[02:54:51.338 --> 02:54:57.520]  Everything you do and say and buy will be inventoried on your global ID card for the carbon tax with carbon rationing.
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:59.240]  That's the official UN plan.
[02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:00.341]  Now Pelosi's saying it.
[02:55:00.341 --> 02:55:02.462]  I'm getting hundreds of emails going, how did you know this?
[02:55:02.462 --> 02:55:03.602]  It's all stated!
[02:55:04.932 --> 02:55:08.193]  DNA illegally taken at birth, now they admit it to the slaves.
[02:55:08.193 --> 02:55:10.935]  Force inoculations now openly being announced.
[02:55:10.935 --> 02:55:14.496]  The census lying and saying you gotta answer questions yearly and monthly.
[02:55:14.496 --> 02:55:17.297]  Running around getting GPS at your front door.
[02:55:17.297 --> 02:55:22.940]  The face scanners, the thumbprint scanners, the license plate readers everywhere you go tracking you.
[02:55:22.940 --> 02:55:30.043]  DHS reports saying gun owners, veterans, those that talk about the Constitution, those that wear, you know, Patriot
[02:55:31.327 --> 02:55:34.248]  Don't tread on me t-shirts or bumper stickers or terrorists.
[02:55:34.248 --> 02:55:36.469]  Most of the Homeland Security funding being spent on that.
[02:55:36.469 --> 02:55:39.370]  The Patriot Act being used in non-terror related cases.
[02:55:39.370 --> 02:55:49.795]  Patriot Act compliance with no more warrants with the feds tied in to the bank's databases looking at everything you buy, sell and do.
[02:55:49.795 --> 02:55:51.275]  Looking at all your transactions.
[02:55:51.275 --> 02:55:52.516]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[02:55:53.660 --> 02:56:01.829]  You know, the biggest one are these no-fly lists, where now if you are on the 1.1 million people and growing by 25,000 a month, no-fly list, you can't own a gun.
[02:56:01.829 --> 02:56:14.203]  They're already using that and refusing people that are on it to buy guns, and veterans to buy guns, even without PTSD, and that's on record, but now they're trying to make it law with the no-fly, no-buy.
[02:56:15.259 --> 02:56:25.259]  Meanwhile, all over the country, the states are making the police license plates and their private car license plates and the bureaucrats and state and federal people where their license plates can't be read.
[02:56:27.325 --> 02:56:31.408]  And where they can speed, get in trouble, basically can't get arrested.
[02:56:31.408 --> 02:56:32.409]  That's mainstream news.
[02:56:32.409 --> 02:56:34.770]  So, we're all slaves being tracked.
[02:56:34.770 --> 02:56:45.838]  If they don't like you, as they admit, anti-war groups on no-fly list, anti-torture groups on no-fly list, congressmen on no-fly list, can't get off, can't find out why you're on it, don't have a second amendment once they do it.
[02:56:45.838 --> 02:56:46.979]  I mean, that's total 1984.
[02:56:49.748 --> 02:57:03.836]  They're using debt to control people, bankrupting us financially, so we have to go to the government hat in hand with their new mobile medical vans and their FEMA centers with medical centers where we want to go to the FEMA camps.
[02:57:03.836 --> 02:57:10.280]  Again, the key here is that the globalists make money and get power and control out of
[02:57:12.131 --> 02:57:16.375]  Owning the private company systems that then government contracts with to implement all this.
[02:57:16.375 --> 02:57:19.317]  It's a revolving door between industry and government.
[02:57:19.317 --> 02:57:24.101]  So they also profit off of their police state that they use to control us.
[02:57:24.101 --> 02:57:25.903]  And that's how this thing grows.
[02:57:25.903 --> 02:57:33.950]  And tomorrow I will carve out an entire hour and make sure I get to the rest of all this and recap what we've already covered.
[02:57:33.950 --> 02:57:36.952]  But that gives you just a window into the control grid.
[02:57:36.952 --> 02:57:38.473]  So we'll get into a lot more tomorrow.
[02:57:38.473 --> 02:57:40.135]  That's about 10% of what I'm going to be covering.
[02:57:41.223 --> 02:57:43.926]  Because we got Tarpley coming up, and I just ran out of time.
[02:57:43.926 --> 02:57:45.588]  I wanted to get into this.
[02:57:45.588 --> 02:57:51.015]  Remember two days ago, Geithner tells China its dollar assets are safe, and it was in the news that he got laughed at?
[02:57:51.015 --> 02:57:54.439]  Well now, dollar declines as nation mulls reserve currency alternative.
[02:57:55.296 --> 02:58:00.981]  And it says in Bloomberg, the world is going ahead and deciding what the new world currency will be.
[02:58:00.981 --> 02:58:07.166]  Well, they're going to have a basket of currencies at first, and then go to a pure face scan, thumb print, global currency.
[02:58:07.166 --> 02:58:09.948]  They're going to go right past the Amaro, right past it all.
[02:58:09.948 --> 02:58:16.293]  You'll still have regional currencies that have your local look, but it's like there's 15 different, you know, Sports Illustrateds.
[02:58:16.293 --> 02:58:17.814]  It's all printed by the same people.
[02:58:17.814 --> 02:58:19.075]  It's standardized.
[02:58:19.075 --> 02:58:24.299]  All the same databases, but that will be globally identified with a thumb print and a face scan
[02:58:25.529 --> 02:58:31.951]  When you use a regional currency set by the New Bank of the World, that will set interest rates, currency rates, and everything.
[02:58:31.951 --> 02:58:36.413]  So, you'll still have paper money, it's just tied to the Cashless Society tracking system.
[02:58:36.413 --> 02:58:38.453]  We'll break this down in 60 seconds.
[02:58:38.453 --> 02:58:42.775]  Stay with us, it's key.
[02:58:42.775 --> 02:58:46.276]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.041 --> 02:58:56.907]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[02:58:56.907 --> 02:58:58.209]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:58:58.209 --> 02:59:02.494]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called InnerFood.
[02:59:02.494 --> 02:59:09.221]  My wife just loves the stuff and now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award.
[02:59:09.534 --> 02:59:10.054]  We're good to go.
[02:59:30.177 --> 02:59:32.598]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[02:59:32.598 --> 02:59:35.059]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.
[02:59:35.059 --> 02:59:37.160]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[02:59:37.160 --> 02:59:42.843]  Go to www.enerfood.com.

[02:59:53.996 --> 02:59:56.377]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.377 --> 02:59:59.718]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:59.718 --> 03:00:02.700]  Initiate.
[03:00:02.700 --> 03:00:09.923]  This is the controlled implosion of our economy by design stated on record by the Globalist.
[03:00:23.516 --> 03:00:25.757]  I believe they miscalculated and it's going to blow up in their face.
[03:00:25.757 --> 03:00:28.237]  You better hope so for the future of humanity.
[03:00:28.237 --> 03:00:31.398]  We got Webster Griffin Tarpley coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:31.398 --> 03:00:41.122]  Right now I wanted to bring Jim Newcomer up because gold is above 980 today, exploding yet again towards the 1000 mark.
[03:00:41.122 --> 03:00:41.902]  And Jim Newcomer
[03:00:42.902 --> 03:00:46.585]  It's got gold and silver priced in the market at $9.30, $9.40.
[03:00:46.585 --> 03:00:54.150]  With the gold and the silver priced into the market when it was a dollar or more under what it is now.
[03:00:54.150 --> 03:01:03.017]  Many other brokers and gold and silver outfits are completely sold out and they're selling for huge premiums.
[03:01:03.017 --> 03:01:08.160]  I wanted to have Jim Newcomer up for just a few minutes before Webster Griffin-Tarpley joins us.
[03:01:08.160 --> 03:01:11.263]  GM going under and, you know, I'm not even tooting my horn here
[03:01:14.352 --> 03:01:28.579]  Jim Newcomer, but we told people two and a half years ago that GM was going to go under by design and that it was going to be moved to China and Brazil, and Burmese came running in here breathing heavy earlier saying, you were right, you were right.
[03:01:28.579 --> 03:01:29.780]  Yeah, yeah, here it is.
[03:01:29.780 --> 03:01:34.222]  AP sourced GM to sell Hummer to Chinese company, but that's only the beginning.
[03:01:34.222 --> 03:01:38.825]  I have about five or six articles I printed this morning because I wanted to make this point and back it up.
[03:01:39.653 --> 03:01:49.878]  And somebody's got to find the tapes of me and Bob Chapman two and a half years ago saying this, and then two years ago, and a year ago, and six months ago, and last week, that this is all by design.
[03:01:49.878 --> 03:01:51.318]  That's why they federalized it.
[03:01:51.318 --> 03:01:58.161]  And this is them handing our industry over to foreigners with money to finance it leaving the country, not just Hummer.
[03:01:58.161 --> 03:02:00.823]  They're announcing their Chinese division's doing great.
[03:02:00.823 --> 03:02:04.784]  I mean, I've never seen such raping, Jim Newcomer.
[03:02:04.784 --> 03:02:05.965]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[03:02:05.965 --> 03:02:06.985]  I agree with you 100%.
[03:02:06.985 --> 03:02:08.106]  What's going on is criminal.
[03:02:09.028 --> 03:02:14.280]  Um, I think years ago there was the old adage that as General Motors goes, so goes America.
[03:02:14.824 --> 03:02:18.805]  Maybe it's a precursor of what's to come.
[03:02:18.805 --> 03:02:19.826]  I don't think it may be.
[03:02:19.826 --> 03:02:22.446]  I think, I mean, until we arrest the bankers, it's over.
[03:02:22.446 --> 03:02:24.467]  Until we end the Fed, it's over.
[03:02:24.467 --> 03:02:28.828]  Jim, I mean, if people don't get into gold and silver now, I mean, I don't know what to tell them.
[03:02:28.828 --> 03:02:35.250]  Whether it's one silver coin or a hundred, or whether it's one gold coin or five, tell folks the great deals you've got today.
[03:02:35.250 --> 03:02:38.671]  Well, the precious metals are real money and they're real value.
[03:02:38.671 --> 03:02:42.593]  Today we've got two of the coins that are most traded in the industry.
[03:02:42.593 --> 03:02:43.193]  That's the $20 Liberty.
[03:02:44.266 --> 03:02:45.446]  At $1,632.60, the $10 Liberty is running $818.50.
[03:02:45.446 --> 03:02:47.347]  We have the Walking Liberty Half Dollars.
[03:02:47.347 --> 03:02:50.187]  These were minted from 1918 to 1947 at $183.60 per roll of $20.
[03:02:50.187 --> 03:02:52.027]  We have the British Sovereigns again at $285.93.
[03:02:52.027 --> 03:02:52.387]  Franks at $231.50.
[03:02:52.387 --> 03:02:54.948]  And the ever popular, the Lakota National Silver Rounds are still available at $434.40 a roll.
[03:03:13.218 --> 03:03:16.220]  What does that come out to a piece?
[03:03:16.220 --> 03:03:17.841]  On the Lakotas, it's $21.72.
[03:03:17.841 --> 03:03:21.083]  Now you can go online, you can search these things out.
[03:03:21.083 --> 03:03:22.564]  You're going to pay $25, $26.
[03:03:22.564 --> 03:03:23.924]  No, I know, they've gone up.
[03:03:23.924 --> 03:03:26.926]  They were $25 a month ago when you guys were selling them for $16.
[03:03:26.926 --> 03:03:30.448]  I mean, amazing.
[03:03:30.448 --> 03:03:31.869]  What about those Franklin halves?
[03:03:31.869 --> 03:03:32.990]  That's really a good deal.
[03:03:32.990 --> 03:03:34.310]  The Franklin halves are gone.
[03:03:34.310 --> 03:03:38.073]  We had to replace that with the Walking Liberty, but the Walking Liberty half dollar is even older.
[03:03:39.489 --> 03:03:43.492]  It's a great value at $9.18, there at $183.60 per roll.
[03:03:43.492 --> 03:03:44.953]  We were real lucky to be able to find it.
[03:03:44.953 --> 03:03:46.394]  How long can you hold that?
[03:03:46.394 --> 03:03:49.476]  Because this is priced into the market a week or two ago.
[03:03:49.476 --> 03:03:51.978]  How long can you hold these deals before it goes up again?
[03:03:51.978 --> 03:03:54.259]  Well, that's hard to say, Alex.
[03:03:54.259 --> 03:03:59.663]  We're going to try to hold it through the end of the week, but if the market takes off, it's going to be almost impossible for us.
[03:04:00.695 --> 03:04:01.215]  No, no, no.
[03:04:01.215 --> 03:04:01.976]  Explain to people.
[03:04:01.976 --> 03:04:03.297]  You bought silver and gold.
[03:04:03.297 --> 03:04:14.124]  Again, you keep buying it when it's low and still selling it for the low price, but you keep running out so it goes up, but by the time you go up, it's already gone up again, so you're passing huge savings on to people.
[03:04:14.124 --> 03:04:15.084]  Yep.
[03:04:15.084 --> 03:04:22.369]  We'll secure a lot of it, and when that lot is gone, I mean, the response has been so tremendous, people calling in and ordering this.
[03:04:22.819 --> 03:04:24.721]  A lot of times we'll run out of what we purchased.
[03:04:24.721 --> 03:04:27.243]  We endeavor to hold the price as long as we possibly can.
[03:04:27.243 --> 03:04:27.303]  800-686-2237.
[03:04:27.303 --> 03:04:34.328]  Folks, if you're trusting in paper and stocks and bonds and the bank alone, I don't know what you're smoking, but I don't want any of it.
[03:04:42.512 --> 03:04:44.073]  I mean, it's simple.
[03:04:44.073 --> 03:04:46.535]  These are great, great deals on gold and silver.
[03:04:46.535 --> 03:04:48.276]  It's a company I believe in and that I trust.
[03:04:48.276 --> 03:04:49.957]  I think you should call right now, 800-686-2237.
[03:04:49.957 --> 03:04:57.181]  We're going to go ahead and get Webster Tarpley online, but I've got one more question for Jim Newcomer when we come back.
[03:04:57.181 --> 03:04:58.562]  Jim, stay there.
[03:04:58.562 --> 03:04:59.743]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:05:01.155 --> 03:05:06.376]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:05:06.376 --> 03:05:10.397]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:10.397 --> 03:05:16.299]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:16.299 --> 03:05:21.360]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:21.360 --> 03:05:25.381]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:25.621 --> 03:05:27.723]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:05:27.723 --> 03:05:30.925]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[03:05:44.016 --> 03:05:45.558]  A long time sponsor of ours.
[03:05:45.558 --> 03:05:50.264]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:50.264 --> 03:05:52.047]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:52.047 --> 03:05:54.610]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[03:05:54.610 --> 03:05:57.253]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[03:06:01.687 --> 03:06:03.368]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:06:03.368 --> 03:06:08.131]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:06:08.131 --> 03:06:11.093]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:06:11.093 --> 03:06:14.134]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:06:14.134 --> 03:06:20.218]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:06:20.218 --> 03:06:23.440]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:06:23.440 --> 03:06:28.743]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic
[03:06:34.838 --> 03:06:35.338]  We're good to go.
[03:07:02.576 --> 03:07:17.944]  An important product from hempusa.org micro plant powder will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[03:07:17.944 --> 03:07:19.344]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica.
[03:07:20.925 --> 03:07:21.665]  We're good to go!
[03:07:44.295 --> 03:07:47.236]  With an unlimited shelf life, you can store it anywhere.

[03:07:52.538 --> 03:07:54.558]  It's a great way to change your life.
[03:07:54.558 --> 03:08:01.360]  So call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[03:08:01.360 --> 03:08:06.762]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.762 --> 03:08:09.043]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:12.133 --> 03:08:17.995]  We're going to Webster Tarpley here in just a moment with the balance of the hour and your phone calls.
[03:08:17.995 --> 03:08:26.297]  But I wanted to give you just a little window into this internal Midas Resources Memorandum.
[03:08:26.297 --> 03:08:31.239]  I get sent these about special deals they're offering.
[03:08:31.239 --> 03:08:36.840]  And I don't even know why I'm supposed to do this, but it says Lakota Nation Silver Round offer price $21.72.
[03:08:39.626 --> 03:08:41.168]  Or $434.40 a roll.
[03:08:41.168 --> 03:08:46.474]  The base cost on the trade is $20.68.
[03:08:46.474 --> 03:08:54.763]  I mean, they're making a dollar and a couple pennies on that.
[03:08:54.763 --> 03:08:57.466]  I mean, that's the markup on these things.
[03:08:57.466 --> 03:09:00.649]  I'm looking at gold coins here that are
[03:09:01.772 --> 03:09:01.952]  You think?
[03:09:22.156 --> 03:09:27.479]  That's absolutely true and be sure to ask for the Alex Jones Special so that you get these prices.
[03:09:45.438 --> 03:09:46.580]  You know, how does Ted do this?
[03:09:46.580 --> 03:09:48.543]  How does Ted sell gold and silver?
[03:09:48.543 --> 03:09:50.426]  Because I always look at these and I've been up there.
[03:09:50.426 --> 03:09:52.590]  I know that these are the prices he's paying.
[03:09:52.590 --> 03:09:53.692]  How does he do that?
[03:09:53.692 --> 03:09:55.595]  Well, to be honest with you, he amazes us.
[03:09:55.595 --> 03:09:59.462]  And I'm just waiting for him to get back from Europe this weekend so we can see what he's bringing with him.
[03:10:01.809 --> 03:10:03.870]  Yeah, it's just absolutely incredible.
[03:10:03.870 --> 03:10:05.311]  800-686-2237.
[03:10:05.311 --> 03:10:14.695]  Those deals you're offering on the Franks, on the British Sovereigns, on the Liberty VF, on the Liberty 10, it's just all excellent.
[03:10:14.695 --> 03:10:15.255]  800-686-2237.
[03:10:15.255 --> 03:10:16.736]  Jim Newcomer, anything else?
[03:10:16.736 --> 03:10:18.437]  No, sir, but have a great afternoon.
[03:10:18.437 --> 03:10:19.177]  Take care.
[03:10:19.177 --> 03:10:21.398]  You know, I didn't tell Webster Tarpley I was going to do this.
[03:10:21.398 --> 03:10:23.499]  By the way, he's in the new Obama film coming up.
[03:10:23.499 --> 03:10:25.400]  One of the main, kind of like the narrator of it.
[03:10:26.800 --> 03:10:29.461]  A bunch of people for this film, wait till you hear about it.
[03:10:29.461 --> 03:10:46.829]  Side issue, the point is, I haven't talked to Tarpley in about a month and a half since he was last here for shooting for the new film, and so much has gone on, I want to pick his brain on that, and I know you do as well, but Tarpley, let me just throw this out at you, because I don't know your view, I know you're an economist, shot in the dark,
[03:10:47.992 --> 03:10:50.853]  And so, I know you'll tell me what you really think.
[03:10:50.853 --> 03:11:00.075]  Do you think gold and silver in this crazy economy is something smart to get into, or should folks hold on to their world currencies and hold on to their stocks and bonds?
[03:11:00.075 --> 03:11:04.316]  I would strongly suggest, Alex, first of all, hi and thanks for having me back.
[03:11:04.316 --> 03:11:12.638]  I would strongly suggest that everybody have a gold hedge, a certain significant percentage of whatever you own ought to be in primarily gold.
[03:11:13.251 --> 03:11:29.137]  And you can see this, we've had this flap of interest in the past two weeks when Standard & Poor's says that the sovereign debt of the United Kingdom, of the British, is going to be degraded down from AAA level to something less, that is, chunkified.
[03:11:29.137 --> 03:11:35.160]  And then Bill Gross of PIMCO comes out, the bond king of course, and says, yeah, and that's going to happen to Treasury bonds too.
[03:11:35.720 --> 03:11:37.541]  That's very, very ominous.
[03:11:37.541 --> 03:11:40.784]  What you've got right now is, of course, the dollar falling rather rapidly.
[03:11:40.784 --> 03:11:42.725]  $1.43 against the euro.
[03:11:42.725 --> 03:11:56.575]  Remember, the dollar had been, for some crazy reasons in the financial system, the dollar had been relatively strong over the last six months or so, but even more so the interest rate on the 30-year long bond of the Treasury.
[03:11:56.575 --> 03:12:00.858]  In other words, when the price goes down, the interest rate goes up.
[03:12:01.318 --> 03:12:12.420]  So this was about 2.5% on the 30-year-long bond in December, and now it's 4.5%, so that's 2% in less than six months, and that's a big move for bonds.
[03:12:12.420 --> 03:12:15.941]  They don't jump around, or they're not supposed to, in the same way that stocks do.
[03:12:15.941 --> 03:12:29.964]  So I think what you're looking at right now is inflation shading over into hyperinflation, shading over into hyperstagflation, and in the middle of that, I think it's still probably, you still have a while to buy some gold.
[03:12:30.684 --> 03:12:33.027]  Uh, before it starts going further up.
[03:12:33.027 --> 03:12:33.868]  Some people despair.
[03:12:33.868 --> 03:12:38.354]  They say, well, I should have bought it when it was $400 or $500 or something like that.
[03:12:38.354 --> 03:12:40.176]  Now it's about $1,000, I guess.
[03:12:40.176 --> 03:12:42.138]  And, uh, they think that it's too late.
[03:12:42.138 --> 03:12:42.799]  It's not too late.
[03:12:42.799 --> 03:12:44.862]  I think it's probably still a very good thing to have.
[03:12:46.189 --> 03:12:57.798]  Well absolutely, but if people try to get gold and silver once the run starts, and people think this is a run on it, this is only the beginning of the gold rush, historically you're not going to be able to get it for any price.
[03:12:57.798 --> 03:13:00.000]  It's going to be really serious.
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:03.043]  Webster, I see a crisis worldwide in all major currencies.
[03:13:04.223 --> 03:13:14.432]  But centering around the pound and the dollar, as you were just saying, you've been ranting and raving for years about GM and Chrysler going under and what this would mean, now devastating.
[03:13:14.432 --> 03:13:31.886]  Now they're saying we'll give you billions, but under IMF, World Bank, World Trade Organization agreements, as you know, but listeners, some may not, just like with the stimulus package, that had to be open for bids worldwide, and a lot of it went overseas, because under these globalist agreements, you can't have the government
[03:13:32.759 --> 03:13:34.840]  Quote, subsidizing its industry.
[03:13:34.840 --> 03:13:37.160]  So we're told this is socialism, but it's not.
[03:13:37.160 --> 03:13:44.582]  It's a pure cash gift to foreign offshore plutocratic bankers, as you say.
[03:13:44.582 --> 03:13:52.965]  And now it's in the news that not only is Hummer going to China, but all the major industry of GM, the vast majority, is going to Opel of Europe.
[03:13:53.445 --> 03:14:06.162]  And to China, and to Brazil, and that American taxpayers will fit the bill for that, and the government will direct what type of cars are then shipped in here, these little tin cans with tiny wheels.
[03:14:06.162 --> 03:14:09.226]  I mean, literally look like a lunchbox with wheels.
[03:14:09.907 --> 03:14:13.028]  I mean, the level of corruption is even amazing me.
[03:14:13.028 --> 03:14:18.771]  So, as a top economist, somebody I really respect, who's proven very accurate in the past, what is happening?
[03:14:18.771 --> 03:14:27.334]  Greg Palast is saying this is a mass looting, that the corporate vultures are using government now to divide and conquer, like they've done in the third world.
[03:14:27.334 --> 03:14:28.475]  What's really going on here?
[03:14:29.124 --> 03:14:37.752]  Well, first of all, it is a world economic depression of incalculable proportions, and I urge everybody... We've just passed this milestone.
[03:14:37.752 --> 03:14:44.418]  When General Motors and Chrysler are both bankrupt, that means the United States is in a very severe economic depression.
[03:14:44.418 --> 03:14:50.323]  So stop... People should stop looking at all these things... They didn't go bankrupt in 29!
[03:14:50.323 --> 03:14:51.204]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[03:14:51.704 --> 03:14:52.904]  Right, no, they've survived.
[03:14:52.904 --> 03:14:55.325]  This is now the lowest stock price they've ever had.
[03:14:55.325 --> 03:14:58.806]  And of course, they didn't go bankrupt in the Great Depression, but now they did.
[03:14:58.806 --> 03:15:00.646]  And they've been driven into bankruptcy.
[03:15:00.646 --> 03:15:09.709]  They were consciously, deliberately driven into bankruptcy by the Obama regime with Larry Summers, Tiny Tim Geithner, and two villains in particular.
[03:15:10.169 --> 03:15:18.115]  Steve Ratner, alias Ratner the Rat, who has been the head of this auto task force that Obama has.
[03:15:18.115 --> 03:15:22.559]  And then his right-hand man, his running dog, is a guy called Brian Deese.
[03:15:22.559 --> 03:15:24.520]  D-E-S-E.
[03:15:24.520 --> 03:15:27.162]  And these are two Wall Street jackals.
[03:15:27.162 --> 03:15:28.964]  These are the typical finance boys.
[03:15:29.882 --> 03:15:35.364]  If you look back over the history of GM, recent decades, it has been destroyed by the finance side.
[03:15:35.364 --> 03:15:46.009]  There's a big tension in any industrial corporation between the industrial engineers on the one side, the people who know production, or maybe sales and marketing, and then the pure Wall Street characters.
[03:15:46.009 --> 03:15:48.050]  And ever since the era of Roger Smith,
[03:15:48.550 --> 03:15:56.758]  Back in the 1980s and approximately then, the finance side of General Motors has triumphed over the other side.
[03:15:56.758 --> 03:15:58.800]  So they've weakened the corporation.
[03:15:58.800 --> 03:16:06.347]  But as we saw at the beginning of April, Obama cynically, deliberately decided that he would drive General Motors into bankruptcy.
[03:16:07.091 --> 03:16:10.814]  For the purpose, among other things, of busting the United Auto Workers.
[03:16:10.814 --> 03:16:14.596]  The United Auto Workers, these poor guys, I sympathize with them.
[03:16:14.596 --> 03:16:18.439]  They voted on Thursday and Friday to vote themselves out of existence.
[03:16:18.439 --> 03:16:20.941]  The trade union movement in the United States
[03:16:21.545 --> 03:16:31.814]  ...has had its most catastrophic defeat in a century when the UAW essentially committed suicide and accepted that deal on 4 o'clock Friday afternoon.
[03:16:31.814 --> 03:16:36.718]  And that's exactly, Webster, that's exactly what you said a year plus ago about Obama.
[03:16:36.718 --> 03:16:40.921]  You said he's the left cover to butcher all of what's left of the industries.
[03:16:40.921 --> 03:16:44.004]  Can you imagine if George Bush or John McCain would have told him to do this?
[03:16:44.004 --> 03:16:48.628]  But if Obama tells him, they just fall over and now the left goes, yeah, he's torturing
[03:16:48.908 --> 03:16:51.591]  Yeah, he's lying, but he's our liar and we love him.
[03:16:51.591 --> 03:16:55.435]  I mean, this is total moral bankruptcy by the left in this country.
[03:16:55.435 --> 03:16:56.036]  Go ahead.
[03:16:56.036 --> 03:17:04.465]  Right, I hope that the support for Obama among these deluded Kool-Aid drinkers will collapse soon, but as you say, right now, it hasn't done so.
[03:17:05.902 --> 03:17:08.303]  Obama is a professional union buster.
[03:17:08.303 --> 03:17:10.343]  That is his family business.
[03:17:10.343 --> 03:17:17.105]  The Ford Foundation and the other foundations, the Annenberg, the Joyce, the Woods, the Camellial and so forth that he's worked for.
[03:17:17.105 --> 03:17:18.165]  What is their business?
[03:17:18.165 --> 03:17:19.805]  What is Saul Alinsky?
[03:17:19.805 --> 03:17:21.706]  Saul Alinsky is a union buster.
[03:17:21.706 --> 03:17:23.006]  He hates the New Deal.
[03:17:23.006 --> 03:17:25.267]  He hates industrial trade unionism.
[03:17:25.267 --> 03:17:31.048]  And his racket is to organize poor people, people who have basically nothing but despair,
[03:17:31.608 --> 03:17:33.910]  And use them as strike breakers and as accountability.
[03:17:33.910 --> 03:17:35.452]  Same thing with carbon taxes.
[03:17:35.452 --> 03:17:48.304]  They are now admitting in the major British papers that this will ship all the dirty industry to the third world with no controls and then they get none of the benefits and then we have no industry here.
[03:17:48.304 --> 03:17:50.607]  All it helps is the consolidators.
[03:17:51.377 --> 03:17:52.677]  Yeah, and the asset strippers.
[03:17:52.677 --> 03:17:55.358]  Let's call them asset strippers, the breakup artists.
[03:17:55.358 --> 03:18:04.521]  Because what Obama has done, therefore, is to drive these companies into bankruptcy so that they would be at the mercy of various groups of asset strippers.
[03:18:04.521 --> 03:18:11.163]  Now, I actually think Opel has fared rather well in the sense that Opel has been bought up, essentially, by Russia, right?
[03:18:11.163 --> 03:18:19.425]  It's a spare bank of Russia that has really taken control of Opel with their plans to go full-time there in the Rhein-Main area of Germany.
[03:18:19.425 --> 03:18:21.066]  And the Russians, obviously, want this.
[03:18:21.186 --> 03:18:32.832]  Look, I understand you like the Russians and you think they're being bullied on, but still, for national security, GM's being gotten by the Russians in Europe, the Communist Chinese are getting parts of it, and so is Brazil.
[03:18:32.832 --> 03:18:34.733]  This is unbelievable!
[03:18:34.733 --> 03:18:37.995]  No, it's a disaster for the United States.
[03:18:37.995 --> 03:18:39.775]  And we're paying for it!
[03:18:39.775 --> 03:18:44.358]  You can't blame these other people for picking up valuable things when the Wall Street jackals and parasites
[03:18:44.958 --> 03:18:46.359]  Go to work.
[03:18:46.359 --> 03:18:48.060]  Let me just describe what this process is.
[03:18:48.060 --> 03:18:49.081]  This has a name.
[03:18:49.081 --> 03:18:52.283]  This is the Mussolini fascist corporate state.
[03:18:52.283 --> 03:18:56.847]  And let me just tax your patience here with a definition of what that is.
[03:18:56.847 --> 03:18:58.368]  The fascist corporate state.
[03:18:58.368 --> 03:19:03.351]  First of all, that corporate doesn't necessarily mean corporation in the modern term of a stock company.
[03:19:03.351 --> 03:19:04.532]  It means a guild.
[03:19:04.532 --> 03:19:07.574]  It means, you know, the master, the journeyman, and the apprentice.
[03:19:07.574 --> 03:19:08.755]  The medieval organization.
[03:19:08.755 --> 03:19:12.778]  So government, labor, and management are fused into one block.
[03:19:12.778 --> 03:19:13.459]  They're merged.
[03:19:14.099 --> 03:19:16.561]  But it's the banking interest that dominates.
[03:19:16.561 --> 03:19:18.101]  It's not the government interest.
[03:19:18.101 --> 03:19:23.405]  It's not like government bureaucrats of some kind of professional caste like in China.
[03:19:23.405 --> 03:19:27.607]  It's a banking crime guild that uses government as a legitimizer of enforcement.
[03:19:27.607 --> 03:19:28.027]  Right.
[03:19:28.027 --> 03:19:32.070]  Washington is an annex of Wall Street, a wholly owned puppet.
[03:19:32.070 --> 03:19:33.370]  Well, that's of course what Obama is.
[03:19:33.370 --> 03:19:34.351]  He's a wholly owned puppet.
[03:19:34.691 --> 03:19:36.052]  Alright Webster, stay there.
[03:19:36.052 --> 03:19:38.974]  Let's break down where the economy's going and how you see things shaking up.
[03:19:38.974 --> 03:19:41.976]  We'll also get into a bunch of other subjects like youth brigades.
[03:20:01.499 --> 03:20:02.819]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:20:02.819 --> 03:20:08.401]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:20:08.401 --> 03:20:13.422]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:20:13.422 --> 03:20:13.903]  It's true.
[03:20:13.903 --> 03:20:18.984]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:20:18.984 --> 03:20:24.225]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:20:24.225 --> 03:20:26.086]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[03:20:26.522 --> 03:20:31.325]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:20:31.325 --> 03:20:32.446]  And here's the best part.
[03:20:32.446 --> 03:20:35.508]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:20:35.508 --> 03:20:39.131]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:20:39.131 --> 03:20:42.333]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:20:42.333 --> 03:20:44.555]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:20:44.555 --> 03:20:45.495]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:20:45.495 --> 03:20:45.895]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:20:45.895 --> 03:20:46.816]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[03:20:55.632 --> 03:20:58.174]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:20:58.174 --> 03:21:01.978]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:21:01.978 --> 03:21:07.223]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:08.016 --> 03:21:13.880]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:13.880 --> 03:21:20.384]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.384 --> 03:21:22.365]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.365 --> 03:21:24.827]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:24.827 --> 03:21:35.694]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:37.998 --> 03:21:39.660]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.660 --> 03:21:41.521]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.521 --> 03:21:48.448]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:21:56.715 --> 03:21:58.277]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.277 --> 03:21:59.478]  The people strike back.
[03:22:01.069 --> 03:22:02.129]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[03:22:02.129 --> 03:22:07.071]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[03:22:07.071 --> 03:22:15.134]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[03:22:15.134 --> 03:22:20.716]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[03:22:20.716 --> 03:22:27.699]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[03:22:27.999 --> 03:22:33.601]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[03:22:33.601 --> 03:22:38.663]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[03:22:38.663 --> 03:22:46.606]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[03:22:46.606 --> 03:22:53.168]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[03:22:53.168 --> 03:22:54.288]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:57.031 --> 03:23:00.672]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.672 --> 03:23:04.194]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:23:04.194 --> 03:23:09.596]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:23:09.596 --> 03:23:14.558]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:23:14.558 --> 03:23:25.522]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:23:25.822 --> 03:23:31.566]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:23:31.566 --> 03:23:37.811]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:23:37.811 --> 03:23:38.672]  What about you?
[03:23:38.672 --> 03:23:40.573]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[03:23:40.573 --> 03:23:44.876]  $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[03:23:50.120 --> 03:23:50.460]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[03:23:50.460 --> 03:23:52.402]  Or order online by visiting us at Directive21.com.
[03:23:52.402 --> 03:23:54.344]  That's Directive, the number 21 dot com now.
[03:24:17.088 --> 03:24:24.814]  Before we ever come this way again, and we're gonna ride.
[03:24:24.814 --> 03:24:28.176]  Man, I could listen to this music all day.
[03:24:45.991 --> 03:24:58.975]  Going back to Webster Tarpley.
[03:24:58.975 --> 03:25:00.376]  Okay, Webster, my friend.
[03:25:00.376 --> 03:25:02.937]  We'll talk about your new book, by the way, that I should be carrying at the bookstore.
[03:25:02.937 --> 03:25:07.118]  We carry your two books on Obama and your book on 9-11, Synthetic Terror, at Infowars.com.
[03:25:07.118 --> 03:25:11.579]  I should throw out, but the new one, Surviving the Cataclysm, you predicted this ten years ago.
[03:25:11.579 --> 03:25:12.760]  It's republished and updated.
[03:25:13.320 --> 03:25:14.920]  I just love people that have a track record.
[03:25:14.920 --> 03:25:17.761]  Yours is so good.
[03:25:17.761 --> 03:25:23.522]  Webster, before we go, the question of the fascist corporate state, because this is important for people to understand.
[03:25:23.522 --> 03:25:31.524]  The fascist corporate state is a state-sponsored compulsory cartel, and it means that Geithner and Summers have picked the winners.
[03:25:31.524 --> 03:25:42.266]  The winners are JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and they're trying to save Citibank if they can, because that's Bob Rubin, who is sort of the gray eminence of this entire clique.
[03:25:42.856 --> 03:25:54.400]  So, they are going to run the General Motors bankruptcy in such a way as to save JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, and sacrifice everybody else.
[03:25:54.400 --> 03:25:56.321]  And that's what people are screaming about.
[03:25:56.321 --> 03:26:06.184]  The other groups, Oppenheimer and Stairway, and a couple of these other hedge funds, have been sacrificed because they're not part of the state-sponsored compulsory cartel.
[03:26:06.184 --> 03:26:07.505]  But notice what's happening.
[03:26:07.505 --> 03:26:08.485]  Production goes down.
[03:26:09.125 --> 03:26:09.986]  No, this is a complete hoax!
[03:26:09.986 --> 03:26:10.726]  This is a complete...
[03:26:31.762 --> 03:26:32.902]  I know, I mean, let me be clear.
[03:26:32.902 --> 03:26:34.083]  I'm not saying... Exactly.
[03:26:34.083 --> 03:26:37.024]  This is a mass hoax to call this socialism.
[03:26:37.024 --> 03:26:39.345]  That's why the media says it every day, every night.
[03:26:39.345 --> 03:26:43.586]  In hundreds of publications, they print that headline that this is Marxism.
[03:26:43.586 --> 03:26:45.106]  This is just piracy.
[03:26:45.106 --> 03:26:49.808]  This is high seas, swashbuckling, knock-us-on-the-head, is it not?
[03:26:50.359 --> 03:26:51.360]  Absolutely illegal.
[03:26:51.360 --> 03:26:54.902]  Now, you've probably seen the Greg Palast article, which I think is very useful.
[03:26:54.902 --> 03:26:59.865]  You could see all these right-wing characters saying, yeah, the UAW has taken over everything.
[03:26:59.865 --> 03:27:07.671]  The UAW has given up guaranteed health care for shares of stock in Chrysler and General Motors that are going to be worthless.
[03:27:07.671 --> 03:27:10.032]  So the risk has been shifted to them.
[03:27:10.032 --> 03:27:15.976]  And as far as I understand, a $6 billion payment is immediately made to JPMorgan Chase and Citibank.
[03:27:15.976 --> 03:27:17.237]  So they are made whole.
[03:27:17.237 --> 03:27:18.398]  They get off with a whole coat.
[03:27:18.718 --> 03:27:20.978]  And then they privatize the risk.
[03:27:20.978 --> 03:27:28.320]  They take taxpayer money, put it into stocks, float it out there, and then when it goes down the tubes, it doesn't matter, it just goes into thin air.
[03:27:28.320 --> 03:27:31.960]  But like you said, JPMorgan Chase, they got the cash up front.
[03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:35.541]  And if you want to look at the real excesses, this is typical, right?
[03:27:35.541 --> 03:27:38.902]  We have the AIG payments from the TARP, right?
[03:27:38.902 --> 03:27:41.002]  From the bailout, the bailout.
[03:27:41.002 --> 03:27:42.942]  So the TARP gave AIG $180 or $200 billion.
[03:27:42.942 --> 03:27:43.382]  Who got that money?
[03:27:47.043 --> 03:27:50.704]  Barclays Bank of Great Britain, 10 billion, 15 billion.
[03:27:50.704 --> 03:27:53.645]  Deutsche Bank of Germany, 10 to 15 billion.
[03:27:53.645 --> 03:27:57.106]  Société Générale of France, 10 to 15 billion.
[03:27:57.106 --> 03:28:02.947]  Union Bank of Switzerland, perhaps the most bankrupt of all the big zombie banks, another 10 to 15 billion.
[03:28:02.947 --> 03:28:04.927]  And Goldman Sachs, 10 to 15 billion.
[03:28:04.927 --> 03:28:05.908]  And AIG, 180 billion.
[03:28:07.375 --> 03:28:10.857]  Right, well, the money was conduited through AIG to them.
[03:28:10.857 --> 03:28:20.003]  And the centerpiece, of course, is this London hedge fund of AIG, which issued $3 trillion of derivatives, more than the gross national product of France.
[03:28:20.003 --> 03:28:21.865]  So that gives you precisely the key.
[03:28:21.865 --> 03:28:28.349]  If you got burned by a hedge fund selling derivatives, your next step is to outlaw hedge funds and to outlaw derivatives.
[03:28:28.849 --> 03:28:34.714]  We have these characters around Obama now talking about their plan to regulate derivatives.
[03:28:34.714 --> 03:28:38.457]  My plan to regulate derivatives is a shredder and a delete button.
[03:28:38.457 --> 03:28:39.839]  In other words, you get rid of them.
[03:28:39.839 --> 03:28:41.180]  You wipe them out.
[03:28:41.180 --> 03:28:44.142]  Not only are they worthless, they're black hole singularities.
[03:28:44.142 --> 03:28:45.163]  I mean, like you said, worthless.
[03:28:45.163 --> 03:28:46.504]  They have negative value.
[03:28:46.504 --> 03:28:47.265]  Negative value.
[03:28:47.265 --> 03:28:48.346]  The Rasputnik.
[03:28:48.346 --> 03:28:52.990]  You gotta pay the mafia garbage men to come and take them away.
[03:28:52.990 --> 03:28:54.271]  Unbelievable.
[03:28:54.271 --> 03:28:56.213]  We're about to break a long segment coming up.
[03:28:57.216 --> 03:28:58.998]  But I've got to get into this with you.
[03:28:58.998 --> 03:29:01.400]  I know you're giving us solutions, and I agree with many of them.
[03:29:01.400 --> 03:29:02.962]  Let's talk about what is going to happen.
[03:29:02.962 --> 03:29:05.124]  They're clearly not going to change course.
[03:29:05.124 --> 03:29:05.805]  They're criminal.
[03:29:05.805 --> 03:29:06.586]  They're all in.
[03:29:06.586 --> 03:29:08.027]  They're going for broke.
[03:29:08.027 --> 03:29:09.689]  All their treasure is staked on this.
[03:29:09.689 --> 03:29:10.890]  Their blood, their name.
[03:29:10.890 --> 03:29:12.412]  They're going all out.
[03:29:12.412 --> 03:29:16.035]  The youth corps are marching on TV in red and black uniforms now.
[03:29:16.035 --> 03:29:17.677]  I don't know if you've seen this.
[03:29:17.677 --> 03:29:19.239]  I mean, we're now entering some type of
[03:29:20.845 --> 03:29:31.129]  Strangelove-ian, Brave New World mixed with Twilight Zone Vortex, where I expect to see floating pink panthers any moment.
[03:29:31.129 --> 03:29:33.350]  So I want flying pigs here.
[03:29:33.350 --> 03:29:34.150]  I want to go over
[03:29:35.236 --> 03:29:43.921]  The worst case scenario, which it appears it is, as we go into hyper-stag inflation, and they don't do what should be done, what is going to happen?
[03:29:43.921 --> 03:29:47.903]  Because I think at this point, things are going to go down the tubes.
[03:29:47.903 --> 03:29:49.584]  How do we salvage something?
[03:29:49.584 --> 03:29:51.665]  Webster Tarpley, stay with us.
[03:29:51.665 --> 03:29:53.066]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.066 --> 03:29:55.607]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.607 --> 03:29:58.289]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.775 --> 03:30:12.364]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:30:12.364 --> 03:30:13.765]  Garden in a Can.
[03:30:13.765 --> 03:30:17.928]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[03:30:17.928 --> 03:30:19.950]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[03:30:19.950 --> 03:30:22.232]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[03:30:22.692 --> 03:30:32.378]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[03:30:32.378 --> 03:30:33.799]  Garden in a can.
[03:30:33.799 --> 03:30:34.999]  It's that simple.
[03:30:34.999 --> 03:30:35.700]  Fresh.
[03:30:35.700 --> 03:30:36.560]  Healthy.
[03:30:36.560 --> 03:30:37.401]  Easy.
[03:30:37.401 --> 03:30:41.743]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[03:30:41.743 --> 03:30:42.624]  Ready when you are.

[03:30:53.654 --> 03:30:54.654]  A new world order.
[03:30:54.654 --> 03:30:57.955]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:31:13.539 --> 03:31:18.981]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[03:31:18.981 --> 03:31:26.305]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:31:29.326 --> 03:31:34.787]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[03:31:41.209 --> 03:31:42.189]  Most people have no idea.
[03:31:42.189 --> 03:31:43.149]  They're not after money.
[03:31:43.149 --> 03:31:44.429]  They have all the money they need.
[03:31:44.429 --> 03:31:45.409]  They're after power.
[03:31:45.409 --> 03:31:46.570]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:31:58.072 --> 03:32:00.614]  You have been warned.

[03:32:03.795 --> 03:32:06.877]  We're way beyond a question of if and when it's upon us.

[03:33:09.212 --> 03:33:12.535]  Alright, Webster, in the time we've got with you, I want to jam in some calls as well.
[03:33:12.535 --> 03:33:15.838]  I've got to have you back up.
[03:33:15.838 --> 03:33:16.659]  Time just flies.
[03:33:16.659 --> 03:33:17.740]  I only need you on for a couple of hours.
[03:33:17.740 --> 03:33:19.082]  Plus, I know you just finished two books.
[03:33:19.082 --> 03:33:28.371]  One on the roots of this cartel and one on their modern activities.
[03:33:28.371 --> 03:33:28.511]  But...
[03:33:30.410 --> 03:33:46.863]  As all this deteriorates faster and faster, and they still prance around saying globalism is the answer, when clearly their system of globalization engineered all of this, whether by hook or by crook, they're the progenitors of the problem that we're under.
[03:33:46.863 --> 03:33:52.187]  And then we have Geithner running around saying, don't worry, the dollar's safe, and the Chinese laugh at him.
[03:33:52.187 --> 03:33:53.368]  That's in the news.
[03:33:53.368 --> 03:33:56.230]  And then the dollar starts plunging even further.
[03:33:58.857 --> 03:34:00.038]  I tend to agree with you.
[03:34:00.038 --> 03:34:04.961]  I mean, I believe they engineered it because they have their own IMF World Bank documents, but it's kind of like them.
[03:34:04.961 --> 03:34:09.143]  Delusional liars tend to start believing their own bull, their own horse crap.
[03:34:09.143 --> 03:34:15.087]  And I really think they've lost control and these psychopathic thieves have endangered the entire shooting match.
[03:34:16.266 --> 03:34:17.546]  I think that's true.
[03:34:17.546 --> 03:34:24.029]  I think we're headed probably towards some kind of acute turn of this crisis.
[03:34:24.029 --> 03:34:29.431]  In other words, we've been living in this fool's paradise with a mugs rally, a sucker rally going on in Wall Street.
[03:34:29.431 --> 03:34:32.332]  But notice, the state of California is collapsing.
[03:34:32.332 --> 03:34:33.592]  General Motors is bankrupt.
[03:34:33.592 --> 03:34:35.213]  Chrysler is bankrupt.
[03:34:35.213 --> 03:34:38.574]  The Toyota car sales are down 40% in the most recent month.
[03:34:39.595 --> 03:34:42.902]  Unemployment continues to be very, very high.
[03:34:42.902 --> 03:34:46.969]  There's about half a million jobs lost per month, every month.
[03:34:46.969 --> 03:34:48.452]  So that's going to be a disaster.
[03:34:48.452 --> 03:34:51.418]  The question is, when do you reach the breaking point on Obama?
[03:34:52.615 --> 03:35:04.307]  Historically speaking, the previous case of the 100% Wall Street puppet president owned by the Trilateral Commission and Brzezinski and Rockefellers and so forth was, of course, Carter.
[03:35:04.307 --> 03:35:15.278]  Carter reached his peak right about now, so to speak, the end of April, beginning of May, mid-May 1977, and after that Carter began to slide into a
[03:35:16.159 --> 03:35:20.500]  Into a decline, and I think that there are signs that that's happening with with Obama.
[03:35:20.500 --> 03:35:32.763]  The left liberals in particular, if you happen to see this campaign for America's future, this Borosage-Kartner-Vanden Heuvel group, the left liberals, sort of the limousine liberal, Learjet liberal types, right?
[03:35:32.763 --> 03:35:35.464]  Merging into parts of the Obama administration.
[03:35:35.464 --> 03:35:39.885]  They're very uncomfortable with this idea of the 13 trillion going to Wall Street,
[03:35:40.385 --> 03:35:43.967]  And a few hundred billion, the crumbs, going to the rest of us.
[03:35:43.967 --> 03:35:45.667]  So I think there's a big problem there.
[03:35:45.667 --> 03:35:49.929]  The question is, if you're going to attack Obama, you've got to attack him from the left.
[03:35:49.929 --> 03:35:51.450]  This is the big thing.
[03:35:51.450 --> 03:35:52.270]  Look at Obama.
[03:35:52.270 --> 03:35:56.332]  He loves to play himself off against Limbaugh, against Newt Gingrich.
[03:35:56.332 --> 03:35:57.592]  No, their own memos say that.
[03:35:57.592 --> 03:36:01.774]  They say, we want to make this about, like, running for office against Limbaugh.
[03:36:01.774 --> 03:36:03.595]  Limbaugh isn't running Jack's squad.
[03:36:03.595 --> 03:36:08.397]  Limbaugh loves the attention, but he knows they're using him as a distraction.
[03:36:08.777 --> 03:36:11.439]  And of course, there's an egomaniac, he can't get enough of it.
[03:36:11.439 --> 03:36:14.641]  The critique that really hurts Obama is a left-wing critique.
[03:36:14.641 --> 03:36:26.570]  Now, you've got to develop some idea of an alternative policy, and it can't be, you know, cut the budget and let everything liquidate into a, you know, general bankruptcy, because that's just going to kill people.
[03:36:26.570 --> 03:36:34.396]  No, they've already hyper-inflated things to the point we need to arrest the bankers and direct all this fiat stuff into real industry so we get something.
[03:36:34.841 --> 03:36:39.928]  Let me just say, one side of life, and I'm surprised by this, but you know Michael Moore, right?
[03:36:39.928 --> 03:36:42.692]  Michael Moore, he's been around for a while, people know him.
[03:36:43.691 --> 03:36:49.273]  If you look at his essay on General Motors, you will see that there are signs of life there.
[03:36:49.273 --> 03:36:52.234]  In other words, it's tinged with this gangrene economy stuff.
[03:36:52.234 --> 03:36:56.136]  It's tinged with this alternative energy claptrap.
[03:36:56.136 --> 03:37:05.839]  But what he says is, you've got to go back to the 1942 conversion of General Motors to war production, and then the reconversion in 1945-46 back into civilian production.
[03:37:08.520 --> 03:37:11.463]  And what could you reconvert those factories to do, right?
[03:37:11.463 --> 03:37:20.652]  Because you've got unemployed workers, 14 more General Motors factories closing, dozens of factories now idle, hundreds of thousands of unemployed autoworkers.
[03:37:20.652 --> 03:37:21.453]  What could you build?
[03:37:21.453 --> 03:37:23.856]  And he says, well, you could build bullet trains.
[03:37:23.856 --> 03:37:28.020]  Now, bullet trains would be, you know, the Japanese trains, but of course they're obsolete now.
[03:37:28.320 --> 03:37:29.280]  We want maglev.
[03:37:29.280 --> 03:37:38.303]  We want magnetic levitation railways where you go from Los Angeles to New York in three hours in a railcar.
[03:37:38.303 --> 03:37:53.106]  Instead they're going to build cruddy local slow trains to nowhere with people so poor they can't even afford to get on them instead of super trains to cities where you say, oh I'm going to shoot down to Dallas on the hour train instead of four hours in a car.
[03:37:53.106 --> 03:37:54.247]  But they won't do it, man.
[03:37:54.247 --> 03:37:55.927]  They will not do it because it's a good idea.
[03:37:55.967 --> 03:38:00.331]  That's what you've got to fight for, and I'm very encouraged to see that some of these ideas are floating around.
[03:38:00.331 --> 03:38:05.676]  So Michael Moore says you can build mass transit, you can build maglev, then he says alternative energy.
[03:38:05.676 --> 03:38:07.057]  He wants to build windmills.
[03:38:07.057 --> 03:38:08.459]  Well, the windmills are crazy.
[03:38:08.459 --> 03:38:09.620]  Build nuclear reactors!
[03:38:11.014 --> 03:38:12.376]  Let's back that up.
[03:38:12.376 --> 03:38:13.036]  Let's back that up.
[03:38:13.036 --> 03:38:19.402]  You can't build windmills because for the amount of power they generate and their cost, there's not a way to transfer the power without power loss.
[03:38:19.402 --> 03:38:22.185]  For those that don't know, power lines lose power.
[03:38:22.185 --> 03:38:30.493]  So the substations to hold that power are too cost prohibitive from the wind centers of the country to deliver it to major megacities.
[03:38:30.493 --> 03:38:33.816]  Now, wind is good in a localized small town setting.
[03:38:34.591 --> 03:38:42.858]  Well, it can be used for specialties when there's no other alternative, but generally speaking, you're going to put more energy into the windmill than you're ever going to get out of it.
[03:38:42.858 --> 03:38:49.503]  So there are some places where you need that kind of thing, but as a base load approach to an industrial economy, it's a bad joke.
[03:38:49.503 --> 03:38:55.668]  It's not a primary driver, but listen, before we get out of time now, I know you want to get into solutions, Webster, but I think people need to understand what's going to happen
[03:38:56.368 --> 03:38:58.249]  Because clearly none of these are being implemented.
[03:38:58.249 --> 03:39:01.832]  And even if people don't agree with your solutions, they've got their own.
[03:39:01.832 --> 03:39:04.674]  Nothing but everything for Wall Street into the black hole.
[03:39:04.674 --> 03:39:11.799]  Everything, clearly, Pentagon, Northcom standing by to deliver us directly into the maw.
[03:39:11.799 --> 03:39:12.780]  And we've got Zoellick
[03:39:14.544 --> 03:39:43.130]  uh... warns stimulus sugar high won't stem unemployment so what's this double speak top neocon world bank president robert zoellick literally an israeli agent publicly warns policy makers that fiscal stimulus plans are insufficient to turn around the real economy and rising joblessness threatens to set off political unrest across the globe and then he goes on so so so why are they making statements about political unrest knowing it's going to happen when they've engineered the policies knowing it would do that
[03:39:43.769 --> 03:39:45.891]  Well, there has been a lot of political unrest.
[03:39:45.891 --> 03:39:50.134]  There's been a big ferment in the trade union movement in Europe.
[03:39:50.134 --> 03:39:54.158]  There have been various kinds of riots and things like this around the world.
[03:39:54.158 --> 03:39:56.880]  And that's why I'm saying the program is absolutely critical.
[03:39:56.880 --> 03:40:01.504]  You can get a mass movement going under these circumstances, but if the Democratic Party collapses,
[03:40:02.102 --> 03:40:05.485]  You've got to have an actual program to get out of the depression.
[03:40:05.485 --> 03:40:13.093]  I would say that's the golden question right now, and it's the most precious wisdom in the world is, how do you actually get out of a depression?
[03:40:13.093 --> 03:40:20.721]  And I believe I know, and that's what I put into this book, Surviving the Cataclysm, which people can get from Progressive Press, and then I hope soon from you.
[03:40:22.162 --> 03:40:25.464]  Yeah, folks, just Google surviving the cataclysm Westbrook-Griffin partly.
[03:40:25.464 --> 03:40:27.065]  Look, look, look, resistance, okay?
[03:40:27.065 --> 03:40:28.845]  A couple of other things going around.
[03:40:28.845 --> 03:40:33.408]  The French government, of all people, the French government has now proposed a Tobin tax.
[03:40:33.408 --> 03:40:34.708]  The securities transfer tax.
[03:40:34.708 --> 03:40:41.012]  In other words, something like a 1% sales tax on Wall Street bankers as they do their trillions of dollars.
[03:40:41.012 --> 03:40:45.314]  I only support that if it's implemented by the nations, not by the very bankers themselves.
[03:40:46.577 --> 03:40:48.739]  Well, it's implemented against the bankers themselves.
[03:40:48.739 --> 03:40:49.999]  They're the ones who pay it.
[03:40:49.999 --> 03:40:51.140]  No, but you understand the U.N.
[03:40:51.140 --> 03:40:55.863]  and the bankers have been proposing a Tobin, but on our money transfers, to bring in a global model.
[03:40:55.863 --> 03:40:56.283]  No, no, no.
[03:40:56.283 --> 03:40:58.064]  On derivatives.
[03:40:58.064 --> 03:40:59.665]  On the rest of their speculation.
[03:40:59.665 --> 03:41:03.908]  Another example, the banks, they have now bid the price of oil up to $67, $68.
[03:41:06.249 --> 03:41:07.349]  Remember who this is.
[03:41:07.349 --> 03:41:09.530]  This is Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
[03:41:09.530 --> 03:41:11.390]  And they operate through the London I.C.E.
[03:41:11.390 --> 03:41:11.810]  Exchange.
[03:41:11.810 --> 03:41:12.350]  You can see it.
[03:41:12.350 --> 03:41:13.631]  They did it last year.
[03:41:13.631 --> 03:41:14.851]  They got it up to $150, $160.
[03:41:14.851 --> 03:41:19.232]  They're trying to do it again.
[03:41:19.232 --> 03:41:20.332]  So that's their thanks.
[03:41:20.332 --> 03:41:21.952]  You bailed them out with the TARP.
[03:41:21.952 --> 03:41:26.373]  Your tax money went to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are now banks.
[03:41:26.373 --> 03:41:27.634]  But of course, they're zombie banks.
[03:41:27.634 --> 03:41:29.194]  The only thing they do is derivatives.
[03:41:29.694 --> 03:41:34.019]  And now they're going to jack up energy so they all make tens of billions.
[03:41:34.019 --> 03:41:41.066]  They've got to drive the price of gasoline and oil up to make some of these crazy windmills look more plausible.
[03:41:41.066 --> 03:41:42.708]  So that's what they're doing.
[03:41:42.708 --> 03:41:47.793]  By the middle of last summer, you were paying $1 for every gallon of gas.
[03:41:47.793 --> 03:41:50.877]  $1 went to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley alone.
[03:41:51.437 --> 03:41:55.618]  So, if you don't like that, what you gotta do is take measures to stop speculation.
[03:41:55.618 --> 03:42:05.321]  100% margin requirements, position limits, and special status for speculators, which is inferior to the status of users and hedgers.
[03:42:05.321 --> 03:42:08.442]  Now, the other aspect of it is the political resistance.
[03:42:08.442 --> 03:42:13.144]  I don't know if you've talked about Sri Lanka, but this seems to me to be very, very, very interesting.
[03:42:13.604 --> 03:42:18.430]  The US and the British, over decades, fomented this Tamil Tiger revolt.
[03:42:18.430 --> 03:42:21.474]  These are terrorist butchers of the worst kind, right?
[03:42:21.474 --> 03:42:24.317]  Suicide bombers, female suicide bombers.
[03:42:24.317 --> 03:42:26.240]  They pioneered all this stuff.
[03:42:26.849 --> 03:42:31.152]  The question now is, the Indian Ocean, as the Chinese lifeline, right?
[03:42:31.152 --> 03:42:36.695]  The Chinese need to get oil from the Persian Gulf, oil from Sudan, raw materials from Africa.
[03:42:36.695 --> 03:42:41.718]  So the Indian Ocean, the arc of crisis, in Brzezinski's terms, is now a key place.
[03:42:41.718 --> 03:42:48.382]  In the middle of this, you have this terrorist army, sponsored by the US and the British, the Liberation Tigers.
[03:42:48.382 --> 03:42:50.043]  And they have now been annihilated.
[03:42:50.043 --> 03:42:54.186]  Their chief, this guy Prabhakaran, has been liquidated.
[03:42:54.784 --> 03:42:57.906]  And what you saw, a very interesting epiphany, right?
[03:42:57.906 --> 03:43:00.708]  The moment where you really see what's what in the world.
[03:43:00.708 --> 03:43:04.630]  As the Sri Lankan army closes in on these awful, awful terrorists.
[03:43:05.293 --> 03:43:18.904]  The British Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, and the French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, come forward and say, oh no, this is terrible, it's a humanitarian catastrophe, we've got to have a ceasefire.
[03:43:18.904 --> 03:43:25.209]  Ceasefire means that the Tamil Tigers escape and live to come back and kill and have more suicide bombers another day.
[03:43:25.529 --> 03:43:33.376]  Unless it's like using Al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs, and then on this airplane in Iran they find the bomb, Iran's on record saying the U.S.
[03:43:33.376 --> 03:43:46.608]  is using Al-Qaeda to attack them, the White House admits under Bush and Obama they're using Sunnis to destabilize Iran, and then the news has the nerve to say that Shiite Iran is Al-Qaeda?
[03:43:46.608 --> 03:43:47.970]  I mean, how dumb!
[03:43:47.970 --> 03:43:50.532]  Don't people know that Al-Qaeda is the U.S.
[03:43:50.532 --> 03:43:51.213]  British government?
[03:43:52.133 --> 03:44:00.378]  Well, the KLA of Kosovo that Biden has just been visiting, and the Tamil Tigers, and the... But I mean, that's how ridiculous it is!
[03:44:00.378 --> 03:44:15.286]  On record, the White House puts out press releases saying, we got four Sunni groups attacking Iran, they're blowing up mosques, trying to blow up airplanes, bombing things, and then they got the nerve to say on the news, look, Al-Qaeda is hitting Iran, we've got to stop Al-Qaeda.
[03:44:15.286 --> 03:44:17.848]  I mean, how dumb do these people think the population is?
[03:44:18.328 --> 03:44:19.869]  And specifically, Jundullah, right?
[03:44:19.869 --> 03:44:22.912]  The Balochistan, U.S.-backed liberation movement.
[03:44:22.912 --> 03:44:26.776]  Now, what the Sri Lankans have done is going to be imitated.
[03:44:26.776 --> 03:44:29.578]  And I think the Pakistanis have gotten the idea.
[03:44:29.578 --> 03:44:32.541]  The reason that Obama wants... I'm going to stop you again.
[03:44:32.541 --> 03:44:35.704]  Pakistan president goes on and says, we're with Al-Qaeda.
[03:44:35.704 --> 03:44:36.925]  You created Al-Qaeda.
[03:44:36.925 --> 03:44:39.508]  You're using the Taliban to isolate our cities.
[03:44:39.508 --> 03:44:42.550]  You're overthrowing us with your Al-Qaeda.
[03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:44.012]  And boy, they didn't like that, did they?
[03:44:45.093 --> 03:45:00.383]  But the answer is that what the Pakistani Army seems to have done is to say, what the Sri Lankans have done, we can do, and that is to say, take the conventional Pakistani Army, go into the Swat Valley, and basically wipe out the Taliban, which are largely people now who have been recruited
[03:45:00.823 --> 03:45:07.345]  By the Indians and by the CIA in Afghanistan and then sent into Pakistan to overthrow the government.
[03:45:07.345 --> 03:45:13.086]  Those people seem to have been pretty much mowed down to about 1,500 so-called Taliban.
[03:45:13.086 --> 03:45:18.747]  In other words, CIA secret army types have been wiped out in the Swat Valley.
[03:45:18.747 --> 03:45:20.708]  Minimal losses for the Pakistani army.
[03:45:20.708 --> 03:45:21.728]  The goal being
[03:45:22.288 --> 03:45:33.015]  That if you can kick the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda out of your country, then Obama will no longer have the pretext to send these killer drones to destroy civilian targets.
[03:45:52.408 --> 03:45:54.689]  I mean, this is on record!
[03:45:54.689 --> 03:46:06.156]  But now, the difference now, there is something new, that under Chinese auspices, and this is simply what's going on, like it or not, they've figured some of this stuff out, it's called the String of Pearls, right?
[03:46:06.156 --> 03:46:16.942]  The Chinese say, well, we need to have Thailand, Burma, Myanmar, we need Bangladesh, we need Sri Lanka, we need the Seychelles, the Comoros, we need to get over to Sudan and Zimbabwe.
[03:46:16.942 --> 03:46:20.584]  These are your Chinese allies, and this is what Brzezinski and Obama
[03:46:21.284 --> 03:46:24.466]  And the Clinton State Department are attacking.
[03:46:24.466 --> 03:46:27.288]  So, there's got then to be a resistance.
[03:46:27.288 --> 03:46:30.089]  And the Chinese are basically showing them how to do it.
[03:46:30.089 --> 03:46:33.991]  With Chinese help, the Sri Lankans have wiped out these Tamil Tigers.
[03:46:33.991 --> 03:46:41.455]  And it may well be that with Chinese help, the Pakistanis are going to liberate themselves of the presence of these Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
[03:46:41.455 --> 03:46:42.276]  I gotta shift gears.
[03:46:42.276 --> 03:46:44.117]  It's a very promising sign in the world.
[03:46:44.117 --> 03:46:46.018]  I think highly interesting people should know about it.
[03:46:46.138 --> 03:46:52.940]  Well, I'm sure we've got to have you up longer than our future to really let you run all this, because you're such an expert on it all, and we really appreciate your time.
[03:46:52.940 --> 03:47:04.822]  But going back here, but at the same time, China is Siamese twins here with the United States and the West, owning the majority of our debt, and are they going to continue to hold the dollar?
[03:47:04.822 --> 03:47:15.565]  How do you see things unfolding versus... There's a big debate in China now, because it is, of course, crazy for a developing country that needs to buy capital goods.
[03:47:16.252 --> 03:47:21.285]  ...to hold large amounts of dollars, paper dollars, in the form of these treasury bonds.
[03:47:22.317 --> 03:47:28.319]  The Chinese leadership, they're really not as clever as they thought they were.
[03:47:28.319 --> 03:47:32.580]  They seem to believe in money, money in terms of paper money, dollars.
[03:47:32.580 --> 03:47:35.441]  Well, these are just green pieces of paper.
[03:47:35.441 --> 03:47:42.543]  If you get some dollars, what you damn well better do with them is go and buy some capital goods, go and buy steel mills, go and buy locomotives.
[03:47:42.543 --> 03:47:44.443]  Well, they're starting to do that though.
[03:47:44.443 --> 03:47:46.084]  China's moving into copper and gold.
[03:47:46.084 --> 03:47:47.204]  They're starting to do it.
[03:47:47.244 --> 03:48:06.859]  But the gales of laughter for tiny Tim Geithner, the tax cheat, the turbo-tax man, when he went to Beijing University and they basically got caught him into non-existence, when he said, I want you to know, I want you to know in the worst way that your investments in U.S.
[03:48:06.859 --> 03:48:10.162]  Treasury bonds are safe and sound, and they just all started laughing.
[03:48:10.777 --> 03:48:15.818]  And I think that's a turning point of world history because it's just untenable.
[03:48:15.818 --> 03:48:23.861]  Because they know a slime bag corporate thief that's destroyed America, a little spider is in there, and it's all just a big joke to them.
[03:48:23.861 --> 03:48:26.201]  They're trying to prop up their biggest market.
[03:48:26.201 --> 03:48:30.942]  But I mean, I think the decision has been made globally that it's the end.
[03:48:30.942 --> 03:48:39.605]  And I guess we'll just be ruled by a bunch of Geithners and Summers and Rubin running around with military
[03:48:40.563 --> 03:48:44.225]  In the time we've got, Webster, then how do you see this unraveling?
[03:48:44.225 --> 03:48:53.888]  And now, have you seen the TV ads that are running nationally with people in black and red uniforms marching, and they're openly announcing that they're going to be on the streets and are on the streets?
[03:48:53.888 --> 03:48:55.849]  I mean, it's actually happening, Webster.
[03:48:55.849 --> 03:49:01.311]  It's one thing to say we think it's coming, but I mean, we are descending into hell here.
[03:49:01.311 --> 03:49:07.474]  Yeah, it's obviously a bad scene, and there are these quasi-fascist or fascist militias
[03:49:08.098 --> 03:49:08.658]  Coming up.
[03:49:08.658 --> 03:49:11.579]  But I urge people, don't take yourself out of the equation.
[03:49:11.579 --> 03:49:14.779]  This whole regime is extremely vulnerable right now.
[03:49:14.779 --> 03:49:15.040]  I agree.
[03:49:15.040 --> 03:49:21.601]  The big problem is, if you go forward and say, you know, we don't like Obama, but we want the free market, that's a loser.
[03:49:21.601 --> 03:49:23.601]  It's just, it's not going anywhere.
[03:49:23.601 --> 03:49:33.664]  Yeah, they're going to have us argue between left and right, when this has nothing to do with it, and a phony right-wing thing versus a left-wing thing, and then meanwhile, it just goes off the edge of a cliff.
[03:49:33.664 --> 03:49:34.944]  But if you get out there and say,
[03:49:35.868 --> 03:49:46.737]  Seize General Motors and reconvert it to produce tractors, nuclear reactors, maglev rail, modern capital goods that can be sold in the third world.
[03:49:46.737 --> 03:49:50.940]  But the globalists don't want to build up the third world.
[03:49:50.940 --> 03:49:54.623]  They want to neutralize them from industry so that they can be controlled.
[03:49:55.083 --> 03:49:55.604]  Absolutely.
[03:49:55.604 --> 03:49:56.845]  So you've got to counter that.
[03:49:56.845 --> 03:49:58.366]  So you counter them in every way.
[03:49:58.366 --> 03:50:00.688]  Counter them nationally and internationally.
[03:50:00.688 --> 03:50:03.029]  So I think it's time to organize.
[03:50:03.029 --> 03:50:11.736]  In other words, I think the Obama deception, your work, and other things have come together now, especially the betrayals of this regime.
[03:50:11.736 --> 03:50:13.618]  We have this guy called Ted Roll.
[03:50:13.618 --> 03:50:14.418]  He's an interesting guy.
[03:50:14.418 --> 03:50:15.479]  I don't know if you saw this, right?
[03:50:15.479 --> 03:50:17.501]  The Illinois State Journal Register.
[03:50:18.121 --> 03:50:19.021]  I didn't see it.
[03:50:19.021 --> 03:50:19.482]  Who was this?
[03:50:35.367 --> 03:50:39.668]  Ted Rall, R-A-L-L, the Illinois State Journal Register.
[03:50:39.668 --> 03:50:42.229]  He's actually, he's an interesting person, a maverick.
[03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:46.591]  He was one of the first people to call for the impeachment of Bush.
[03:50:46.591 --> 03:50:48.571]  Stay there, stay there, Webster.
[03:50:48.571 --> 03:50:49.431]  Final segment.
[03:50:49.431 --> 03:50:52.272]  I was going to take calls, we took a lot earlier, but I just am out of time.
[03:50:52.272 --> 03:50:54.073]  Julio and Chris and Matthew and Dave and Rick.
[03:50:54.073 --> 03:50:55.253]  Call back tomorrow, you'll be there first.
[03:50:55.253 --> 03:51:00.615]  We're going to come back in the final segment because I want to talk about what they're saying the solution is.
[03:51:01.755 --> 03:51:08.960]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:51:08.960 --> 03:51:13.523]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:51:13.523 --> 03:51:19.127]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[03:51:19.127 --> 03:51:26.672]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:51:26.672 --> 03:51:31.575]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[03:51:32.035 --> 03:51:37.899]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:51:37.899 --> 03:51:43.682]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[03:51:43.682 --> 03:51:49.645]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[03:51:49.645 --> 03:51:52.407]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[03:51:52.407 --> 03:51:53.147]  Or by calling 269-216-9767.
[03:51:53.147 --> 03:51:53.368]  269-216-9767 today!
[03:52:02.190 --> 03:52:08.017]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.017 --> 03:52:15.586]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.586 --> 03:52:21.754]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:22.174 --> 03:52:24.156]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:24.156 --> 03:52:26.638]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.638 --> 03:52:38.226]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.226 --> 03:52:39.908]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.908 --> 03:52:41.769]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.769 --> 03:52:47.974]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.661 --> 03:52:56.931]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.931 --> 03:52:58.493]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.493 --> 03:53:02.938]  The people strike back.
[03:53:02.938 --> 03:53:03.999]  Hi, this is Steve Shenk.
[03:53:08.874 --> 03:53:09.094]  I'm good.
[03:53:19.520 --> 03:53:27.503]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[03:53:27.503 --> 03:53:34.626]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[03:53:34.626 --> 03:53:36.466]  Food is an everyday need.
[03:53:36.466 --> 03:53:40.428]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to
[03:53:43.575 --> 03:53:43.795]  I think so.
[03:54:03.803 --> 03:54:06.725]  Hi, going back to Tarbley in the final few minutes here in just a moment.
[03:54:06.725 --> 03:54:13.069]  I want to first tell you about our final sponsor of the day, making this hour possible, New Silver Solution.
[03:54:13.069 --> 03:54:18.132]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?
[03:54:18.132 --> 03:54:24.637]  I want you to go to SupernaturalSilver.com today and or visit the link on InfoWars.com to find out more about this incredibly
[03:54:26.235 --> 03:54:26.415]  No.
[03:54:43.809 --> 03:54:45.530]  Keep the area sanitized for hours.
[03:54:45.530 --> 03:54:47.091]  They have a lot of different products.
[03:54:47.091 --> 03:54:52.794]  The new silver solution is highly effective, potent, nanoparticle solution that is lethal to bacteria, yeast, and viruses.
[03:54:52.794 --> 03:54:56.856]  Go to supernaturalsilver.com and see the amazing line of products they have available.
[03:54:56.856 --> 03:55:03.339]  The new silver solution is patented and has been extensively tested with proven effectiveness and is non-toxic to both humans and animals.

[03:55:12.225 --> 03:55:14.387]  That's supernaturalsilver.com.
[03:55:14.387 --> 03:55:16.570]  Okay, Webster, look, here's the deal.
[03:55:16.570 --> 03:55:17.531]  You've got your solutions.
[03:55:17.531 --> 03:55:18.932]  I agree with a lot of it.
[03:55:18.932 --> 03:55:20.394]  We're not in control of things.
[03:55:20.394 --> 03:55:22.076]  The people don't want what the bankers are doing.
[03:55:22.076 --> 03:55:23.377]  They want what you're saying.
[03:55:23.377 --> 03:55:24.058]  Common sense.
[03:55:24.058 --> 03:55:24.758]  It's not happening.
[03:55:25.399 --> 03:55:31.482]  Bloomberg saying how dare the American people not love what's happening with GM.
[03:55:31.482 --> 03:55:33.103]  As if we don't care.
[03:55:33.103 --> 03:55:34.523]  As if we haven't been raped enough.
[03:55:34.523 --> 03:55:39.926]  That's being used as a distraction of the tens of trillions that have been sucked out right to the bankers.
[03:55:40.566 --> 03:55:53.214]  But they're having a fake solution that is carbon taxes, shutting down most of the industry, as Pelosi said in China, categorizing and registering everything we do, carbon credit, ration cards.
[03:55:53.214 --> 03:56:09.845]  I don't think the public realizes that not only are they going to bankrupt things, their new economy is this debt economy by design to bring in neo-feudalism and serfdom that you cover in the Obama deception so eloquently that I hope folks will get at InfoWars.com and show to people quickly.
[03:56:10.405 --> 03:56:18.969]  So, in closing, how do we... we have to not just have solutions, we have to discredit their power grab of the whole economy that's left.
[03:56:18.969 --> 03:56:21.910]  I mean, there's no way to say this wasn't designed.
[03:56:21.910 --> 03:56:25.111]  Everything they're doing is designed to criminally consolidate.
[03:56:25.111 --> 03:56:33.715]  Well, we're all looking forward to the next product coming out of your shop there, if it's July 4th or thereabouts.
[03:56:33.715 --> 03:56:37.556]  And there may be possibly ways to regroup further.
[03:56:37.556 --> 03:56:39.197]  I mean, we might want to think about
[03:56:39.858 --> 03:56:48.828]  Some form of conferences, maybe in the late summer, early autumn, bring together various kinds of forces that are in resistance.
[03:56:48.828 --> 03:56:52.111]  I wonder if C-SPAN would put us back on.
[03:56:52.111 --> 03:56:52.772]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:56:52.772 --> 03:56:53.433]  It's possible.
[03:56:53.433 --> 03:56:56.196]  Phil Berg is continuing to with his lawsuits.
[03:56:56.836 --> 03:57:04.660]  To expose Obama, he thought he had oral arguments in the Third Circuit in Philadelphia, but they've pushed him now into the autumn.
[03:57:04.660 --> 03:57:09.183]  But at a certain point, I think that the climate of opinion begins to change.
[03:57:09.183 --> 03:57:20.409]  In other words, I think Obama has now passed his peak, and I think people should therefore take heart and redouble their efforts and keep fighting the good fight, because Obama is now more vulnerable.
[03:57:21.609 --> 03:57:37.643]  The idea that these left liberals at their Campaign for America's Future conference are so uncomfortable about the fact that the guy is such an obvious Wall Street puppet, so subservient to Summers and all of these zombie bankers.
[03:57:37.643 --> 03:57:40.805]  I think that's beginning to crack this edifice.
[03:57:40.805 --> 03:57:47.251]  Well, I think what began to crack it was him saying no rights for detainees and the torture is going to continue and we're going to open new camps.
[03:57:47.251 --> 03:57:48.352]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[03:57:48.939 --> 03:57:52.820]  Right, but therefore, the big question is, economic program.
[03:57:52.820 --> 03:57:53.941]  Do you have one?
[03:57:53.941 --> 03:58:05.745]  In other words, can you criticize Obama in a way that makes it clear that you're not talking about having the Depression work its full fury on the population, but you're actually proposing solutions that would work?
[03:58:05.745 --> 03:58:09.507]  And again, reconverting General Motors to make maglev trains.
[03:58:09.507 --> 03:58:12.868]  That's the idea that will, I think, take off and lead us into the future.
[03:58:14.144 --> 03:58:19.147]  Well, certainly that's better than just giving $14.8 trillion to a bunch of criminal bankers.
[03:58:19.147 --> 03:58:20.047]  Clawback!
[03:58:20.047 --> 03:58:20.688]  Clawback!
[03:58:20.688 --> 03:58:22.569]  Operation Clawback on the bankers!
[03:58:22.569 --> 03:58:24.670]  Well, we need to audit the Fed.
[03:58:24.670 --> 03:58:26.611]  That's going to expose how they're criminals.
[03:58:26.611 --> 03:58:30.473]  We need to get more state sovereignty to expose the central government.
[03:58:30.473 --> 03:58:32.174]  Webster Tarpley, great talking to you.
[03:58:32.174 --> 03:58:35.055]  Let me say bye to you as the show ends here in just a moment.
[03:58:35.055 --> 03:58:39.258]  Retransmission with all the big guests starts now on the web at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:39.258 --> 03:58:39.978]  Great job of the crew.
[03:58:39.978 --> 03:58:40.879]  We'll be back in one minute.
[03:58:40.879 --> 03:58:41.259]  Stay with us.
[03:58:43.339 --> 03:58:45.963]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:45.963 --> 03:58:51.712]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.712 --> 03:58:56.981]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?
[03:58:57.526 --> 03:59:06.111]  Check out SupernaturalSilver.com today or visit the link on InfoWars.com to find out more about this incredible new silver compound.
[03:59:06.111 --> 03:59:13.236]  The new silver solution is a natural antibiotic that is clinically tested to kill viruses, germs, bacteria, and yeast safely.
[03:59:13.236 --> 03:59:18.999]  This new technology has proven itself to be a formidable weapon against bio-threats of today and tomorrow.
[03:59:18.999 --> 03:59:24.543]  The new silver solution gel has been shown to disinfect topically and keep the area sanitized for up to 4 hours.
[03:59:25.183 --> 03:59:25.723]  We're good to go.
