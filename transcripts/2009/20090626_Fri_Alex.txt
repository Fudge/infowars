[00:00:00.134 --> 00:00:02.339]  In Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:07.691]  All right, we're halfway into this Friday transmission, 26 day of June 2009.
[00:00:12.398 --> 00:00:19.103]  All freedom lovers should be in attack formation because we've got incoming big capital ships, the New World Order, are bombarding the Republic.
[00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:23.947]  Open, giant, complete takeover of all industry, your homes, private property.
[00:00:24.448 --> 00:00:28.051]  The carbon takeover, the carbon tax takeover is in full swing.
[00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:29.852]  The debate ends in about one hour.
[00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:35.216]  They're set to vote on it coming up at six o'clock central this evening.
[00:00:35.997 --> 00:00:37.078]  They say six to seven.
[00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:40.559]  Um, coming up tonight.
[00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.602]  So we'll be watching this nightmare as it unfolds.
[00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:49.670]  Also, the next big attack salvo, we got that torpedo cruiser coming in firing at us.
[00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:53.695]  Itself a total martial law takeover, but the enemy's doing overkill.
[00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:55.877]  All these new bureaucracies and new powers.
[00:00:56.658 --> 00:01:03.481]  So they can slice it up between themselves and so it's not just one, one dragon we gotta slay, but a multi-headed hydra.
[00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:06.402]  Total Federal Reserve dictatorship admitted by the news.
[00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:14.306]  They say it's good, ruling everything from a hot dog stand to a beauty salon, to a car dealership, to a shopping mall, to a factory.
[00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:15.526]  I'm gonna go over that.
[00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:16.747]  And Ed Bernanke,
[00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.434]  Ben Bernanke up on C-SPAN saying Congress has no authority to regulate money.
[00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:25.275]  Well, that's Article 1, Section 8.
[00:01:25.455 --> 00:01:29.338]  You're a congenital, degenerate, criminal, and you need to be arrested.
[00:01:29.538 --> 00:01:30.339]  You're a liar as well.
[00:01:31.337 --> 00:01:33.078]  So, we're taking your calls right now.
[00:01:33.098 --> 00:01:34.719]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:39.281]  Okay, calls for 20-30 minutes, and then I'm getting back into this big Bernanke thing.
[00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:41.322]  And you want me to hear me talk about Michael Jackson?
[00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:43.523]  Okay, I'll talk about Michael Jackson for you.
[00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:45.644]  You don't care your whole birthright's being stolen?
[00:01:45.865 --> 00:01:48.326]  You want to worry about some drug addict pedophile?
[00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:51.127]  Fine, we'll talk about drug addict pedophiles coming up as well.
[00:01:51.147 --> 00:01:52.388]  But you're not going to like what you hear.
[00:01:52.748 --> 00:01:54.069]  I know a lot of you are fans of him.
[00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.851]  And I'm not saying the guy didn't have some music that was, I guess, okay.
[00:01:59.141 --> 00:01:59.621]  I feel good!
[00:02:19.537 --> 00:02:21.958]  Living in America!
[00:02:22.178 --> 00:02:22.619]  Ha ha!
[00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.780]  With bureaucrats ruling over you, baby!
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.501]  Ha ha!
[00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:29.102]  So, uh, I could play some James Brown.
[00:02:29.122 --> 00:02:30.743]  I could sing to it for you like I did last week.
[00:02:31.703 --> 00:02:35.445]  Alright, let's go ahead and, uh, or how about some Jimi Hendrix?
[00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:39.788]  Hey Jude, I shot my woman down.
[00:02:39.988 --> 00:02:40.588]  Shot her down.
[00:02:40.608 --> 00:02:42.969]  In fact, cue that up.
[00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:43.830]  Let's play some of that later.
[00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:46.920]  Listen, the battle is now.
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.122]  Call these criminals in Congress, tell them no.
[00:02:50.142 --> 00:02:50.362]  800-833-6354.
[00:02:50.382 --> 00:02:50.702]  800-833-6354.
[00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:55.064]  I'll give you more to tell.
[00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:56.125]  No one can read the bill.
[00:02:56.445 --> 00:02:59.586]  We only have an earlier version that was one-tenth as long.
[00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:06.750]  Or no, that'd be... I don't know, it was 200 pages, now it's over 1,300.
[00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.212]  So yeah, basically... basically, uh...
[00:03:12.048 --> 00:03:15.071]  A tiny fraction, and it was bad enough, and now it's just unbelievable.
[00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.612]  Let's talk to Mark in Oregon.
[00:03:16.632 --> 00:03:17.413]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:19.474]  Well, good morning, Alex.
[00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:20.475]  Hey, buddy.
[00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:39.191]  Alex, you know, toward hitting these bastards where it really hurts, a movie totally exposing and ripping the cover off of pedophilia in the United States, as is practiced by much or most of these higher echelons of the New World Order, as well as throughout the world, this is a practice.
[00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:48.794]  It only gives power and more power to evil, and evil grows through it, and that's kind of an involved process, but that's the way that it turns out.
[00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:53.096]  Now, hurting the innocents better you tie a millstone around your neck than hurt one of these little ones.
[00:03:53.617 --> 00:03:57.919]  Yeah, I think it would be a multi- I volunteer to tie the millstones around their neck all day long.
[00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:05.602]  I really think it would be a multi-megaton blast of truth and exposure upon this highly evil practice, which
[00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:11.275]  You know, like I say, it just is one of their main energizers.
[00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:16.856]  It's what really gives them that demonic ability of having no conscience.
[00:04:16.876 --> 00:04:17.636]  It's their treat!
[00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:18.956]  It's their treat.
[00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:20.676]  Yeah, it's their treat.
[00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:21.476]  It's their dessert.
[00:04:21.536 --> 00:04:22.417]  It's their sacrament.
[00:04:23.037 --> 00:04:23.297]  That's right.
[00:04:23.317 --> 00:04:25.517]  I'd like to give them a sacrament of a bullet between the eyes.
[00:04:26.737 --> 00:04:28.678]  After we hear they have a jury of their peers, of course.
[00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:30.778]  We can just hang them.
[00:04:32.838 --> 00:04:33.538]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:34.279]  Thank you, Mark.
[00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:35.859]  I'm going to hurry through your calls when we get back.
[00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:36.239]  Stay with us.
[00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.463]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:50.487]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:56.312]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:04:56.612 --> 00:05:01.456]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:02.176]  Number 3.
[00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:08.039]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:08.419]  Number 4.
[00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:11.540]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.182]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:15.442 --> 00:05:15.662]  Number 5.
[00:05:16.302 --> 00:05:19.924]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:05:20.144 --> 00:05:25.647]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:28.948]  You can get more information at www.solutionsfromscience.com.
[00:05:29.048 --> 00:05:30.430]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.111]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:05:32.352 --> 00:05:34.674]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:45.106]  Well, you should.
[00:05:45.406 --> 00:05:49.651]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:50.332]  That's right.
[00:05:50.672 --> 00:06:00.584]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[00:06:00.704 --> 00:06:06.111]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol.
[00:06:06.331 --> 00:06:14.553]  In the caliber of your choice, I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:06:14.913 --> 00:06:20.134]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:06:20.434 --> 00:06:21.574]  This is real.
[00:06:21.894 --> 00:06:22.635]  Don't miss out.

[00:06:41.263 --> 00:06:42.825]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:47.569]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:50.451]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:53.534]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:58.438]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:06:58.638 --> 00:06:59.579]  If you simply prepare.
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.684]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:07:03.024 --> 00:07:09.914]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:07:10.014 --> 00:07:13.138]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:07:13.298 --> 00:07:13.559]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:15.962 --> 00:07:18.203]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:29.810]  Again, 1-800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.330]  Take action today.
[00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.591]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:07:42.586 --> 00:07:48.231]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:03.022]  Waging war on corruption, crashing with lies and disinformation.
[00:08:04.504 --> 00:08:05.605]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:06.365 --> 00:08:09.087]  We have got to defeat the New World Order.
[00:08:09.728 --> 00:08:10.769]  We've got to get angry,
[00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:25.328]  We've got to get focused, we've got to decide that it's good and wholesome to hate tyranny and corruption and people telling you how to live and what to do.
[00:08:25.349 --> 00:08:27.730]  They've got all these excuses, all these reasons.
[00:08:27.931 --> 00:08:31.554]  They're a pack of criminal, degenerate liars!
[00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:37.793]  And man, folks, you can't be decadent and slack-jawed and giggle and snicker anymore.
[00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:43.817]  You're already losing your jobs and everything's going to hell in a handbasket, and they got carbon taxes to shut down everything further!
[00:08:44.878 --> 00:08:48.800]  And Federal Reserve takeovers, and federal takeovers of all water in all the states!
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.521]  I mean, this is happening!
[00:08:51.682 --> 00:08:54.223]  A tax on the Fourth Amendment, the second, the first!
[00:08:56.125 --> 00:08:59.907]  Let's blitz through calls, I'm getting into the other outrages and back into the climate bill.
[00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:01.724]  Being debated.
[00:09:01.904 --> 00:09:03.345]  Debate closes down in the next hour.
[00:09:03.365 --> 00:09:06.046]  Gonna vote on it then in the next three hours after that.
[00:09:07.707 --> 00:09:09.728]  Sometime, they said, between 6 and 7 Eastern.
[00:09:09.788 --> 00:09:12.209]  So, I guess 5 and 6 Central.
[00:09:13.589 --> 00:09:15.910]  To be technical, but you never know with their chicanery.
[00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.151]  They've been changing bill numbers.
[00:09:17.411 --> 00:09:18.652]  Nobody's read the bill.
[00:09:19.352 --> 00:09:21.133]  It was 200 pages a week ago.
[00:09:21.553 --> 00:09:23.274]  It's 1,300 yesterday.
[00:09:23.454 --> 00:09:25.374]  They said they added 300 more last night.
[00:09:25.575 --> 00:09:27.015]  Nobody can see the thing.
[00:09:27.876 --> 00:09:28.276]  That is...
[00:09:29.773 --> 00:09:31.094]  But there's been miracles before.
[00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:31.635]  It's set.
[00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:33.797]  They say it's very close, but probably going to pass.
[00:09:33.817 --> 00:09:35.439]  But there's such liars, who knows what that means.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.722]  It's just like three years ago.
[00:09:40.816 --> 00:09:47.682]  They started trying to pass amnesty bills for the next year and a half, and the third time they said, it's not an amnesty bill, but the bill's secret, you can't see it.
[00:09:48.222 --> 00:10:05.456]  And God bless him, Senator Sessions, he's not perfect, but he did release the bill, he got in trouble for it under Senate rules, supposed to keep that secret from the slaves, and it wasn't just amnesty, it was legalizing all illegal alien felons, they could bring in limited members of their family, just total amnesty pardons.
[00:10:08.544 --> 00:10:10.005]  Clemency, whatever you want to call it.
[00:10:10.525 --> 00:10:12.727]  Worse than amnesty.
[00:10:13.508 --> 00:10:14.828]  And then we barely beat that.
[00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:22.454]  So see, they wanted to get the border broken, so before the economy imploded, because they knew once it imploded, it'd be harder to go ahead and get rid of the border.
[00:10:22.754 --> 00:10:23.955]  Now that's in trouble for them.
[00:10:25.606 --> 00:10:28.187]  They got their gun bills and they got it controlled by the Democrats.
[00:10:29.008 --> 00:10:33.010]  And they're trying to pass bills to let the Attorney General ban any guns he wants, whatever he wants.
[00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:38.794]  And bills to shut down gun manufacturers and gun stores and private transfer to your friends.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.261]  To put you on a no-fly list, no-gun-buy list, no-judge, no-jury, no-record.
[00:10:44.621 --> 00:10:47.442]  I mean, cyber-bullying bills, openly banned free speech.
[00:10:47.782 --> 00:10:49.163]  I mean, we're just getting hit here.
[00:10:49.403 --> 00:10:50.743]  They're making their move, man.
[00:10:51.063 --> 00:10:54.505]  We're at the LMO, the enemy's coming up over the walls.
[00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:58.246]  It's time to be swinging your rifle, folks.
[00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.032]  It's time to be swinging that Kentucky Long Rifle.
[00:11:02.312 --> 00:11:03.112]  I mean, this is it.
[00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:05.054]  We're not even in gunshot range anymore.
[00:11:05.074 --> 00:11:05.894]  It's bayonets.
[00:11:06.294 --> 00:11:07.055]  It's swords.
[00:11:07.115 --> 00:11:08.536]  It's ahhh!
[00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:10.197]  I mean, they're in Among Us.
[00:11:10.277 --> 00:11:10.617]  It's it.
[00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:16.481]  I mean, they're saying, secret police, foreign troops, North Com openly to use troops on the U.S.
[00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:16.962]  citizens.
[00:11:17.282 --> 00:11:18.663]  They're coming in at every angle.
[00:11:18.683 --> 00:11:19.243]  This is it.
[00:11:19.523 --> 00:11:20.504]  And this is just beginning.
[00:11:21.044 --> 00:11:29.370]  You think the battle's heated up now with their ships up against us, with their cannons blasting full range at us, and we're sitting here and half our people don't even know we're in a fight of our lives.
[00:11:33.168 --> 00:11:37.672]  They want to know about Michael Jackson, some freak, some drug addict freak.
[00:11:37.872 --> 00:11:39.674]  It's been obvious that guy's been in a daze.
[00:11:39.874 --> 00:11:46.360]  Like Jaron Neihardt said, it's like the last 20 years he's been on heroin or opium on his Ferris wheel.
[00:11:51.084 --> 00:11:52.806]  He's a sad, pathetic person.
[00:11:53.447 --> 00:11:54.468]  It doesn't matter.
[00:11:55.188 --> 00:11:56.870]  It's a perfect distraction right now.
[00:12:00.435 --> 00:12:02.076]  He was shooting up a variant of opium.
[00:12:02.876 --> 00:12:03.937]  A variant of morphine.
[00:12:07.198 --> 00:12:08.799]  I mean, you can tell that guy's on TV.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:16.123]  Hi, uh, oh, yes, oh, I, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:12:16.743 --> 00:12:20.965]  And you'd see him on TV with his nose with, like, plastic on it, like, flapping in the wind.
[00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:22.766]  I mean, that's power.
[00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:23.726]  That's the world.
[00:12:23.786 --> 00:12:27.308]  That's being so insecure you have your face chopped up a hundred times.
[00:12:28.249 --> 00:12:28.909]  Probably more.
[00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:42.382]  All you women, all you men that feel inadequate and buy all the media hype, all of it, it's all lies, it's all bills, it's all soul-killing garbage to neutralize you so you don't have a desire to control your own destiny.
[00:12:42.622 --> 00:12:45.285]  You think I care, I got sunspots or my hair's falling out?
[00:12:45.705 --> 00:12:48.388]  I'm tempted to just cut my hair off and walk around in sackcloth.
[00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:50.770]  I never knew what that meant when I was reading out the Old Testament.
[00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:54.234]  It's about getting humble and stop caring about the crap!
[00:12:58.251 --> 00:13:02.623]  Because I don't want to turn into Michael Jackson and all cultures turning into him!
[00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:15.855]  You know, all these decadent Hollywood people that aren't centered?
[00:13:16.675 --> 00:13:18.056]  It's a blessing that they rot.
[00:13:18.116 --> 00:13:19.257]  It's a blessing they die.
[00:13:19.277 --> 00:13:21.618]  Because their decadence and evil is finally brought to an end.
[00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:23.139]  Death's the great equalizer.
[00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:26.621]  Those of us that love God and honor and decency, we're not afraid of death!
[00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:28.983]  Because we're beyond all your worldly crap!
[00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:36.353]  The only reason I don't want to die is because I don't want to continue fighting you as long as I can stay here, whatever the cost!
[00:13:36.613 --> 00:13:38.815]  I'm committed, and God knows I'm committed.
[00:13:39.376 --> 00:13:41.237]  That's why I'm protected to some extent.
[00:13:41.497 --> 00:13:44.740]  But it may become God's will at some time that I water the tree of liberty.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.262]  And if that is the will of God, it will happen.
[00:13:47.442 --> 00:13:54.828]  And the New World Order hates it that we're committed, and they hate it that we don't believe in their God of destruction, and tyranny, and disease, and pain.
[00:13:55.828 --> 00:13:59.892]  We believe in the God of strength, and will, and honor, and wholesomeness, and goodness.
[00:14:01.058 --> 00:14:05.000]  Green fields and the stars in the night, evidence of his handiwork.
[00:14:06.041 --> 00:14:11.064]  The God of creation and of living water, not your God of weakness.
[00:14:12.144 --> 00:14:14.325]  We're not afraid of death because we're so alive.
[00:14:14.565 --> 00:14:17.227]  We realize that it's all part of God's plan and we go on.
[00:14:17.547 --> 00:14:20.389]  And you fear death and you should, because for you,
[00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:22.573]  There is eternity.
[00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:25.795]  Your soul, your spirit, your essence will be with yourself.
[00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:26.956]  And that is hell.
[00:14:27.796 --> 00:14:31.058]  Hell is what you love, and it's what you get.
[00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:35.840]  All right, I said I'd take calls.
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.841]  I'm out of control today.
[00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:38.522]  Stuart and Mass, you're on the air.
[00:14:39.762 --> 00:14:40.182]  Hey, Alex.
[00:14:40.222 --> 00:14:40.863]  How's it going?
[00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:41.803]  Hey, buddy.
[00:14:42.484 --> 00:14:44.305]  The absurdity is a killer, isn't it?
[00:14:46.065 --> 00:14:47.566]  Everything is so absurd, man.
[00:14:47.646 --> 00:14:48.867]  It's crazy.
[00:14:50.266 --> 00:15:04.085]  I was going to say, you hide the fact that you are a Zionistic, Jew-hating, Vatican assassin, bigoted, CIA MI5 reptile assassin pretty well.
[00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:15.842]  No, no, and I'm also from Planet Pop-Tart, but the issue is, the issue is, that's all a worldly diversion.
[00:15:15.902 --> 00:15:17.463]  Let's say I'm the worst person in the world.
[00:15:17.523 --> 00:15:17.943]  I'm not.
[00:15:18.343 --> 00:15:19.583]  I'm for real, and people know that.
[00:15:19.604 --> 00:15:20.704]  That's why we've been successful.
[00:15:21.184 --> 00:15:29.448]  Some of those that are deceived can't see it, and they get actually upset by me because they've got their own issues that they need to rectify, and I actually feel sorry for my enemies more and more.
[00:15:30.307 --> 00:15:38.092]  But the issue is, is that none of us are perfect, but having guts is good, and guts is enough, as they say, and I agree with that in Full Metal Jacket.
[00:15:38.692 --> 00:15:48.278]  Taking action, getting out of the lukewarm into the hot or cold, choosing a side, but regardless, my fruits are good, and I'm here awakening people to the false reality.
[00:15:48.298 --> 00:15:53.901]  Now, what they find, or what they see, you know, after they've been awakened
[00:15:56.682 --> 00:15:57.342]  Is another thing.
[00:15:57.682 --> 00:16:06.785]  And people lead down rabbit trails, they wake up, but only for a time, and then die, you know, in their awakening.
[00:16:10.026 --> 00:16:15.768]  Other people, you know, wake up, but then get seduced and decide to join evil.
[00:16:15.828 --> 00:16:19.429]  And some people wake up and then just get more and more knowledge, more and more understanding.
[00:16:19.669 --> 00:16:20.289]  But go ahead.
[00:16:22.486 --> 00:16:24.547]  You use parables a lot.
[00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:28.349]  What I was doing was... I got a bit of a parable.
[00:16:28.409 --> 00:16:30.951]  This is for the police.
[00:16:30.971 --> 00:16:49.320]  I'm sick of the whole, some of the police are good, and maybe some of them are, but... What if I were to say, I'm going to join the mafia, and the mafia's bad, but I'm going to take some of that money, I'm going to take that money that I get from robbing and stealing and killing, and I'm going to give it to the poor and help some old ladies out.
[00:16:50.083 --> 00:16:50.764]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:16:51.064 --> 00:16:52.926]  That's almost what it's like to me.
[00:16:53.607 --> 00:16:58.652]  And, uh, you know, all these police out there, you know, and even the congressmen that are now waking up.
[00:16:59.253 --> 00:17:01.415]  I mean, you know, like you said, we're at the brink now.
[00:17:01.435 --> 00:17:03.017]  So all these
[00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:03.882]  I don't know.
[00:17:22.501 --> 00:17:43.767]  And the thing that kills me is when I calculate in my brain everything that you talk about, all these issues, so much damage has been done that even if the people stand up right now, today, this very second, which we're not going to, and turn things around, the damage that has been done to this country is so bad that I believe
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.783]  That it's going to be a long time before things get better.
[00:17:47.803 --> 00:17:54.168]  You know, with 1 in 150 kids, you said it's probably closer to 1 in 75 being autistic now.
[00:17:54.528 --> 00:17:59.952]  What kind of a future do we have with a generation like that that's going to go up and take over?
[00:17:59.992 --> 00:18:04.596]  When I was in high school, I knew when my generation took over, we were going to be in big trouble.
[00:18:04.656 --> 00:18:11.422]  I can't even imagine when the kids growing up now take over, but I guess that's all I have to say, and have a good day Alex.
[00:18:12.418 --> 00:18:13.499]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:14.740]  I appreciate your call.
[00:18:16.982 --> 00:18:21.345]  Yeah, we have to learn to recognize evil and be able to deal with it and face it down.
[00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:25.189]  We have to be able to do that.
[00:18:25.249 --> 00:18:28.191]  I'm going to come back and take more calls and then I've got that Federal Reserve News.
[00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:32.695]  The video we're going to be playing for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:18:35.526 --> 00:18:41.351]  You know, and every time I have success reaching out to people, that's then proof that I'm bad.
[00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:43.773]  Well, the fact is what matters is my fruits.
[00:18:44.313 --> 00:18:48.156]  The fact is I'm here not compromising, telling the truth, fighting the New World Order.
[00:18:50.098 --> 00:18:56.183]  And I believe what I'm saying and I do the best job I can to fight these forms of tyranny over the minds and souls of men and women.
[00:18:57.103 --> 00:19:01.467]  But every time I mention that we're on XM, three hours on
[00:19:03.254 --> 00:19:05.295]  Saturdays, people go, oh my God, you're evil.
[00:19:05.696 --> 00:19:06.716]  Oh my God, that means you're bad.
[00:19:06.796 --> 00:19:19.264]  No, that means that they know I have a giant audience, so they're kind of putting their toe in the water, putting me on, because even a lot of the people that are in that company, though it's owned by Globalist, I'm sure, realize what's going on, because I've talked to some of them.
[00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:27.030]  So they're taking a risk to put me on, and then even me talking about it may even get us kicked off, and then that'll please people out there, of course, who don't want to beat the New World Order.
[00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.093]  But we're on XM Channel 165, Saturdays, 5 to 8 p.m.
[00:19:31.133 --> 00:19:31.513]  Central.
[00:19:32.034 --> 00:19:34.816]  XM Channel 165, Saturdays, 5 to 8 p.m.
[00:19:34.856 --> 00:19:35.196]  Central.
[00:19:35.616 --> 00:19:38.459]  And they might be putting us on five days a week in the near future.
[00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:41.201]  So that's another little victory right there.
[00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:44.791]  We're good to go.
[00:20:06.596 --> 00:20:12.379]  Pepperspray.com carries one of the largest assortments of pepper spray and personal safety products on the web.
[00:20:12.599 --> 00:20:15.040]  From big to small, we have it all.
[00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:19.082]  Pepper spray, mace, animal repellents, stun guns, and tasers.
[00:20:19.323 --> 00:20:25.726]  Pepperspray.com also carries a large assortment of products for personal, home, child, and pet safety.
[00:20:26.046 --> 00:20:27.787]  Enter SAFE in the coupon box.
[00:20:27.967 --> 00:20:28.227]  We're good.
[00:20:43.465 --> 00:20:44.507]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:44.907 --> 00:20:50.394]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:20:50.974 --> 00:20:51.455]  That's right.
[00:20:51.775 --> 00:20:54.078]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:20:54.619 --> 00:21:01.567]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:02.108 --> 00:21:09.795]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:15.099]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.724]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:21.544 --> 00:21:25.648]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:26.028 --> 00:21:26.288]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:26.308 --> 00:21:28.230]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:28.610]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:29.430]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:34.113]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:48.167 --> 00:21:53.530]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:21:54.051 --> 00:22:00.254]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:00.535 --> 00:22:02.376]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:02.536 --> 00:22:04.917]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:04.977 --> 00:22:15.864]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:19.410]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.252]  It's about a one world government.
[00:22:21.692 --> 00:22:28.017]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:36.383]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:36.864 --> 00:22:38.005]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:38.445 --> 00:22:39.626]  The people strike back.
[00:22:41.331 --> 00:22:44.355]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:48.320]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.064]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[00:23:36.213 --> 00:23:40.574]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[00:23:46.275 --> 00:23:48.096]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:23:50.176 --> 00:23:54.157]  I sit down with Big Brother and the National ID.
[00:23:55.865 --> 00:24:04.268]  Yeah, they got their cashless society control grid going into place, their carbon tax grid, their Patriot Act compliance grid.
[00:24:04.308 --> 00:24:05.448]  Total bondage.
[00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:14.011]  And private interest owned the whole police state and environmental grid as they forced the whole economy through bureaucracy into their hands.
[00:24:15.912 --> 00:24:18.793]  This is 21st century tyranny.
[00:24:19.914 --> 00:24:20.934]  Let's go back to your calls.
[00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:25.052]  Let's talk to Craig in New York.
[00:24:25.092 --> 00:24:25.753]  Craig, go ahead.
[00:24:26.874 --> 00:24:27.754]  Hey, Alex.
[00:24:27.854 --> 00:24:28.855]  Just one little thing.
[00:24:28.895 --> 00:24:31.336]  You were talking about the lifted profits body.
[00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:34.298]  It was Joseph that was lifted out of Egypt during the exodus.
[00:24:34.398 --> 00:24:37.740]  But anyway, I work in the office right now, but I'm done teaching.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.744]  And I noticed in international shipping, they're starting to put SDR value on all the packages on the U.S.
[00:24:43.784 --> 00:24:44.464]  Postal Service.
[00:24:45.325 --> 00:24:47.386]  It has an exchange rate of about $4 to $1.
[00:24:47.866 --> 00:24:49.167]  And I've never seen that before.
[00:24:49.627 --> 00:24:50.768]  So bad Chapman isn't on.
[00:24:50.788 --> 00:24:52.189]  I have no idea when they started that.
[00:24:53.786 --> 00:25:06.746]  Well, for those that don't know, they're not just issuing SDRs, they've created a bunch of other special global currencies that are above physical or paper money level that are just exchanged between banks.
[00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:09.049]  So they've already made the world currency.
[00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.092]  And that's already operating, and they admit they are.
[00:25:12.512 --> 00:25:21.941]  Now they're setting up the new bank of the world that will regulate every facet of our lives through the carbon tax, through the regional Federal Reserve Banks, and through the other systems.
[00:25:23.062 --> 00:25:26.164]  But I didn't know that they were already on international shipping.
[00:25:26.605 --> 00:25:31.669]  You're saying they've already stopped having it in dollar denominations, and it's in SDRs?
[00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.691]  I think it's an exchange rate.
[00:25:33.731 --> 00:25:37.434]  Obviously, if you were, let's say, the Prison Planet store would send something to Canada.
[00:25:38.266 --> 00:25:39.308]  And you use the U.S.
[00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:50.150]  Postal Service for shipping, you would pay with your credit card or whatever you use, let's say $18, and it's for $80 value, the value has been converted for SDRs, I assume for accounting purposes.
[00:25:51.308 --> 00:25:51.748]  Amazing!
[00:25:51.788 --> 00:26:07.371]  Wait a minute, you're telling me they're already officially converting not to Euros or not to loonies or not to pounds, like you'll see on the back of a paperback book, or a hardbook, hardcover, $12 U.S., $14 Canadian.
[00:26:07.751 --> 00:26:09.671]  You're saying now it's got SDR.
[00:26:10.552 --> 00:26:14.832]  Well, as of a week ago, $80 equaled exactly $25.04 in SDRs.
[00:26:18.681 --> 00:26:19.542]  And anyone could do it.
[00:26:20.183 --> 00:26:25.829]  I have to send out these packages, and anyone could go to USPS, send something to Canada, and that's what you're dealing with.
[00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:26.910]  It's right there on the front.
[00:26:27.351 --> 00:26:28.091]  Hey, do me a favor.
[00:26:28.131 --> 00:26:28.692]  Thank you, sir.
[00:26:28.712 --> 00:26:29.493]  I appreciate that.
[00:26:29.553 --> 00:26:30.614]  Call Tim in here, please.
[00:26:31.235 --> 00:26:32.036]  Go get him right now.
[00:26:34.058 --> 00:26:39.844]  Look, I remember two years ago, because I'm an employer, and I have the...
[00:26:41.246 --> 00:26:50.232]  Texas Employment Commission, they come and arrest you if you don't fill out all these forms on your employees and be tracked by them, and then they report to the Department of Labor.
[00:26:50.853 --> 00:26:57.438]  And it said, you don't report to the Department of Labor anymore, it said you report to this North American Union Agency.
[00:26:58.278 --> 00:27:00.940]  And the state said, no longer report to us, you report to this.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.661]  It's a quasi-governmental group.
[00:27:03.342 --> 00:27:07.945]  So, and then Jerome Corsi had a story on it, World Net Daily, and in Human Events.
[00:27:10.854 --> 00:27:11.634]  It's really happening.
[00:27:12.594 --> 00:27:22.416]  But I'm going to ask our shipping guy if, right now on air, you know the other day I called my wife in here to talk to Webster Tarpley in Italian and French.
[00:27:22.796 --> 00:27:23.816]  She was going, I can't hear him.
[00:27:24.256 --> 00:27:24.956]  I can't hear him.
[00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:30.277]  And I wonder why she was talking over him and her headset wasn't plugged in.
[00:27:30.757 --> 00:27:36.398]  So my wife's sitting there not even able to talk to Tarpley, but I think they still had somewhat of a conversation with me saying, how do you say this?
[00:27:36.418 --> 00:27:36.998]  How do you say that?
[00:27:37.378 --> 00:27:40.299]  Hey, Tim, we just had a caller saying that when he ships UPS to Canada,
[00:27:40.879 --> 00:27:44.961]  It's no longer saying a loonie conversion or a pound conversion.
[00:27:45.441 --> 00:27:46.701]  It is a SDR.
[00:27:47.442 --> 00:27:52.544]  That's those new international bank special reserve drawing rights.
[00:27:53.544 --> 00:27:56.285]  Special drawing rights is this new made-up global currency.
[00:27:56.305 --> 00:28:00.227]  See, because they're going to skip right past world currencies to directly to biometrics.
[00:28:00.267 --> 00:28:03.828]  You thumbprint, you face scan, and then it's whatever your regional currency is.
[00:28:04.128 --> 00:28:05.309]  It can even be a MasterCard.
[00:28:05.689 --> 00:28:09.732]  That's why they're now having Wells Fargo get the illegal aliens without IDs.
[00:28:09.772 --> 00:28:13.054]  They give them a card and the government accepts that to get a driver's license.
[00:28:13.494 --> 00:28:15.095]  So it's just everything will be a card.
[00:28:16.196 --> 00:28:17.777]  Private corporations can issue cards.
[00:28:18.277 --> 00:28:22.339]  Everything will be money because it'll all be tied to your face scan thumbprint.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.320]  So it won't matter.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.601]  But can you check into what he was saying?
[00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:26.602]  Do you know anything about that, Tim?
[00:28:26.722 --> 00:28:27.983]  No, I've not heard about that.
[00:28:28.351 --> 00:28:29.452]  I will check into it right now.
[00:28:29.472 --> 00:28:30.172]  I will look into that.
[00:28:30.212 --> 00:28:32.293]  On ours it shows, I'm pretty sure it's US dollars.
[00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:55.957]  I don't understand, or maybe he's talking about the Postal Service, not... Check our postals, because we just pay UPS here in dollars, and then it goes up there.
[00:28:55.977 --> 00:28:56.778]  Right, exactly.
[00:28:56.878 --> 00:29:03.701]  Yeah, because I know when we ship to Canada, they go to the... Canada's one of the countries that they go to two central hubs.
[00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:04.942]  Yeah, because they search everything.
[00:29:04.982 --> 00:29:05.462]  Exactly.
[00:29:05.522 --> 00:29:06.383]  It's such a free country.
[00:29:06.423 --> 00:29:06.783]  Yeah.
[00:29:07.464 --> 00:29:10.785]  So free, they tear through every package with pleasure and smash the goods half the time.
[00:29:11.206 --> 00:29:12.786]  They wear little black Nazi outfits.
[00:29:13.367 --> 00:29:14.207]  Just freedom everywhere.
[00:29:14.267 --> 00:29:14.648]  Thank you.
[00:29:15.108 --> 00:29:16.028]  Thank you so much, Tim.
[00:29:16.048 --> 00:29:16.669]  There goes Tim.
[00:29:17.725 --> 00:29:19.886]  Brugier, here in the office.
[00:29:21.648 --> 00:29:22.868]  He hadn't drunk enough fluoride.
[00:29:22.908 --> 00:29:25.410]  He soon will love the New World Order.
[00:29:26.311 --> 00:29:28.012]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:28.392]  Stay with us.
[00:29:31.974 --> 00:29:32.875]  We're on the march.

[00:30:47.031 --> 00:30:48.192]  Inner Health Botanicals.

[00:30:52.615 --> 00:30:54.176]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:30:54.476 --> 00:30:59.419]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award.
[00:30:59.699 --> 00:31:00.740]  Or best superfood of 2009.

[00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:46.276]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:31:46.496 --> 00:31:50.277]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:50.517 --> 00:31:56.119]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:56.419 --> 00:32:01.261]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:01.481 --> 00:32:01.921]  Number three,
[00:32:02.381 --> 00:32:07.826]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:32:08.687 --> 00:32:11.350]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:15.794]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:16.114 --> 00:32:19.718]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:32:19.958 --> 00:32:25.443]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:32:25.683 --> 00:32:30.247]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:30.387 --> 00:32:31.928]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:51.107 --> 00:32:52.108]  People come and go.
[00:32:52.128 --> 00:32:54.809]  Our lives are out, out.
[00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:56.890]  Like a candle.
[00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:01.793]  And may you bury me under the old apple tree, son.
[00:33:01.853 --> 00:33:03.374]  They touch your sweet lips again.
[00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:08.756]  Yeah, the seasons don't fear the reaper.
[00:33:15.558 --> 00:33:30.543]  But to see a republic fall, and to see it fall with scientific tyranny, to see the rending and tearing, the raw and quartering of my beloved nation, is very, very painful.
[00:33:35.164 --> 00:33:37.225]  Alright, thank you for joining us.
[00:33:39.605 --> 00:33:58.582]  I want to go back to your phone calls, but I need to go ahead and get into the news dealing with the outlandish criminal behavior of the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve, and then a recap of the global climate bill.
[00:33:58.702 --> 00:34:02.205]  Because when I say global, it's to pay taxes internationally to a private new bank of the world.
[00:34:02.545 --> 00:34:05.568]  In fact, let's see that debate right now going on in C-SPAN for a moment.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.261]  Here's a Democrat saying how great it is.
[00:34:25.248 --> 00:34:39.734]  You and others have expressed concern about this issue, and this matter will be determined by the work of the Financial Services Committee and the Agricultural Committee.
[00:34:40.154 --> 00:34:41.895]  That's weasel waxman.
[00:34:42.395 --> 00:34:47.557]  Once they agree on the issue that's within their jurisdiction... You know, that's another good point.
[00:34:47.597 --> 00:34:51.159]  We're going to be popping in throughout the next hour and a half.
[00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:52.439]  We have a left in transmission.
[00:34:52.479 --> 00:34:53.840]  I may even go into overdrive today.
[00:34:55.103 --> 00:34:58.924]  Talking about this, because there's only a few talking points that Democrats have.
[00:34:58.984 --> 00:35:02.105]  It's, this'll give us millions of jobs, this'll kickstart the economy.
[00:35:02.205 --> 00:35:07.007]  No, it's a managed economy, $2,500 to $2,800 per person to start with.
[00:35:07.287 --> 00:35:09.468]  We can't see the whole bill, that's the old bill.
[00:35:09.828 --> 00:35:12.089]  It's five, six times and growing longer.
[00:35:12.449 --> 00:35:14.569]  Hundreds of pages being added a day secretly.
[00:35:14.929 --> 00:35:15.970]  Nobody can see it.
[00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:35.561]  In there is a global carbon tax, satellite tracker boxes in the cars that tax you by the mile, huge taxes on electricity, gasoline, oil, plastics, everything made from it, home inspections federally, other bills racing through like the Clean Water Restoration Act, total federal jurisdiction over every square foot of the U.S.
[00:35:35.881 --> 00:35:37.422]  for above or below ground water.
[00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:38.763]  Everything's got water under the ground.
[00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:39.923]  Total control.
[00:35:40.223 --> 00:35:41.124]  No more Bill of Rights.
[00:35:41.164 --> 00:35:42.585]  Come on your property without warrants.
[00:35:43.005 --> 00:35:44.546]  New bureaucracies being set up.
[00:35:46.075 --> 00:35:49.057]  And don't forget who invented all of this.
[00:35:49.157 --> 00:35:49.858]  It was Enron.
[00:35:51.058 --> 00:35:53.400]  Enron came up with a carbon trading scheme.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:36:09.171]  Enron were the money laundering, drug dealing, scam artist fronts who would, in California, set up a fake energy trading company and give the state reps tours, it came out in the news, of computers hooked up to fake algorithms with fake trading.
[00:36:09.391 --> 00:36:12.233]  They just set the prices every day and would rip people off
[00:36:12.873 --> 00:36:34.950]  During that one summer, back in 2001-2002, for a couple billion dollars a week, extra money they were stealing, just in California, and it came out in their memos, they would turn the power off for a few hours, because their memos said, not having power creates the perception of artificial scarcity, so then when we turn the power back on, and tell them it's going to cost three or four times, they'll believe it!
[00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:38.637]  This is the criminals!
[00:36:38.857 --> 00:36:48.873]  Just like diamonds are actually semi-precious, but they control where they're dug out, and governments control them with payoffs, through the De Beers and Oppenheimers, and so they are...
[00:36:49.847 --> 00:36:53.969]  Truly scarce in Main Street, but in the real world they're not.
[00:36:54.669 --> 00:36:55.269]  Same fraud.
[00:36:55.489 --> 00:36:57.470]  Turn their power off, they'll accept higher prices.
[00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:00.731]  Same thing the IMF and World Bank have been caught doing in their own memos.
[00:37:01.472 --> 00:37:11.356]  BBC reported back in 2002, all over the world, when they take over third world country, they turn the water, turn the power off for a while, to jack up prices, and then to also cause rioting.
[00:37:12.636 --> 00:37:14.137]  So the people will accept higher prices.
[00:37:14.337 --> 00:37:16.998]  Because if they triple prices, then when they cut them back,
[00:37:18.274 --> 00:37:20.675]  By half, they've still accepted an increase.
[00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:24.517]  It's all psychological games that are being played with you.
[00:37:25.957 --> 00:37:28.198]  So you tune in randomly, they're talking about carbon taxes.
[00:37:30.219 --> 00:37:32.800]  And these are derivatives.
[00:37:35.233 --> 00:37:44.297]  I seek clarification of two provisions in section 788 of the bill relative to the forest lands and forestry sector.
[00:37:44.857 --> 00:37:54.802]  Specifically on page 198, line 14 of the bill, I'd like to know if the agricultural sector language includes forest lands and forestry sector.
[00:37:55.462 --> 00:38:08.100]  Also on page 199, line 22 of the bill, I'd like to know, does the term projects include sustainable forest practices such as avoided deforestation agreement?
[00:38:09.405 --> 00:38:23.511]  I want to thank the gentleman for his work on improving the definition of biomass in this bill, and ensure him that just as with many USBA conservation programs, forest land fully qualifies for this energy incentive program, and it's our intent that it be included in this section.
[00:38:23.531 --> 00:38:25.132]  Alright, that's enough from that punk.
[00:38:26.433 --> 00:38:34.776]  And again, you've seen them grab GM, grab Chrysler, and then they openly on the open market say, give campaign contributions to the Democratic Party.
[00:38:35.317 --> 00:38:35.977]  This is on record.
[00:38:37.219 --> 00:38:39.280]  And you might get to keep your dealership open.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.261]  You got a $15 million, a $5 million dealership.
[00:38:42.501 --> 00:38:45.722]  Those are two cases that have been covered in Congress in Minnesota.
[00:38:46.803 --> 00:38:47.663]  Two different dealerships.
[00:38:47.703 --> 00:38:49.864]  And they said, no, you're Republicans, you don't get to keep them open.
[00:38:50.464 --> 00:38:53.145]  Give us your list, move out, we own it, you're done.
[00:38:54.966 --> 00:38:56.487]  Ninety-year-old dealership in one case.
[00:38:58.107 --> 00:38:59.128]  This is just mafia.
[00:39:00.088 --> 00:39:02.129]  And if you're a globalist company, you can do whatever you want.
[00:39:03.493 --> 00:39:05.195]  But if you're not, it's over for you.
[00:39:05.816 --> 00:39:08.921]  And so it's 1,300 plus pages and they say they added 300 more.
[00:39:09.361 --> 00:39:15.470]  So we're not, the bills they're just now seeing and getting, because they're about to vote on it, we're not even allowed to see this.
[00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.895]  And Congress no way can read all of it, and they're adding more every minute.
[00:39:20.356 --> 00:39:25.777]  And notice, I've been watching this, and I've seen Congress, watched Congress a lot, Republicans aren't even being given the copies.
[00:39:25.797 --> 00:39:26.977]  They're going, what's in it?
[00:39:27.017 --> 00:39:27.617]  We don't know.
[00:39:27.918 --> 00:39:38.220]  And the Democrats, who are about to vote for it, they say, well let me check my district, because it's all sorts of scams and control, where you've got to go to the imperial lords locally and make payoffs to even be able to do business.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.940]  This is just mafia control.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:45.001]  So the Democrats are the few getting up going, well I'm going to vote for it, but does this take all the land in my district?
[00:39:45.796 --> 00:39:46.236]  For you?
[00:39:46.877 --> 00:39:48.058]  Well, only a little bit of it.
[00:39:48.518 --> 00:39:50.300]  Bob, we're going to leave you alone for now.
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:53.062]  Just let us skin these bastards, alright?
[00:39:55.524 --> 00:39:56.745]  I mean, this is hardcore.
[00:39:58.126 --> 00:40:01.389]  Give these creatures a call right now.
[00:40:01.409 --> 00:40:01.469]  1-800-833-6354.
[00:40:01.489 --> 00:40:01.549]  1-800-833-6354.
[00:40:10.632 --> 00:40:11.513]  Call these criminals.
[00:40:11.573 --> 00:40:13.134]  Call their home districts as well.
[00:40:13.414 --> 00:40:18.478]  And tell their secretaries and people, just say, I'm going to come do whatever it takes to get you out of office, you criminal.
[00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:20.660]  And mainly the Democrats.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:21.781]  Call the Democrats.
[00:40:22.081 --> 00:40:23.483]  They've got a lot of whore Republicans.
[00:40:23.883 --> 00:40:26.885]  You can Google, Republican says he's going to vote for climate bill.
[00:40:27.326 --> 00:40:28.066]  Greenhouse bill.
[00:40:28.387 --> 00:40:31.349]  And you'll find, you'll see a whole bunch of articles with the ones that are out there pushing it.
[00:40:31.389 --> 00:40:33.130]  Call those little creatures up.
[00:40:33.951 --> 00:40:36.193]  And stand up to them.
[00:40:36.273 --> 00:40:38.295]  Up on InfoWars.com, up on screen.
[00:40:39.485 --> 00:40:44.367]  We'll put up the numbers for everybody for you as well.
[00:40:45.687 --> 00:40:53.870]  So, alright, let me go ahead and get into this now, and then I'm going to get back into that, and I'm going to take calls for the rest of the show after this, but I hope listeners want to talk about the climate bill.
[00:40:54.450 --> 00:41:01.172]  What you find out is, 1,300 we know, 3,000 added, but not the exact number, but it's probably going to be 1,600 to 800 pages.
[00:41:05.285 --> 00:41:07.307]  Just like they didn't read the Patriot Act before passage.
[00:41:07.347 --> 00:41:08.107]  They wouldn't allow it.
[00:41:08.247 --> 00:41:10.529]  One hour before passage, they released the full bill.
[00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.091]  And then the next day, on the internet, released it.
[00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:15.493]  I mean, that right there, they can't pass this.
[00:41:15.753 --> 00:41:21.638]  But we gotta do it, or the Earth is gonna... the polar bears are all gonna drown, and the cities... I mean, I've seen the newscast.
[00:41:22.398 --> 00:41:30.605]  I sent you guys a Discovery Channel Monday, but we never played it, where they're going, Houston will flood, everyone will die, they've gotta build a domed city over Houston, or we're all dead.
[00:41:33.155 --> 00:41:33.716]  People don't believe me.
[00:41:33.736 --> 00:41:37.839]  Just Google Dome City over Houston for global warming and we can at least put it on screen.
[00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:41.682]  We don't have time to play the newscasts because I've got too much to cover.
[00:41:41.962 --> 00:41:43.264]  I mean, it's like we're all going to die.
[00:41:43.284 --> 00:41:44.905]  They're teaching the kids we're all going to die.
[00:41:45.185 --> 00:41:46.486]  We've got to reduce world population.
[00:41:46.506 --> 00:41:47.947]  We've got to pay 80% taxes.
[00:41:48.328 --> 00:41:56.274]  We've got to work as slaves for the government where the kids are learning to grow gardens during one hour of school and then that's sold by the school for money for the school.
[00:41:56.775 --> 00:41:59.097]  Service is forced service to the state.
[00:42:00.325 --> 00:42:03.687]  It all sounds reasonable, oh how sweet the kids are growing tomatoes.
[00:42:03.807 --> 00:42:06.088]  I mean this is getting so sick.
[00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.051]  And I know why people get fooled by Glenn Beck.
[00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:19.376]  I was watching him yesterday here in the office and he was admitting that the big oil companies, energy companies, and big banks are behind the global warming, that it's a big Enron scam.
[00:42:19.936 --> 00:42:20.616]  Totally true.
[00:42:20.916 --> 00:42:21.537]  Great guy.
[00:42:23.078 --> 00:42:28.641]  Until you realize he also says arrest 9-11 truthers, ban free speech, arrest Ron Paul supporters, there's no FEMA camp.
[00:42:28.661 --> 00:42:28.801]  See,
[00:42:29.878 --> 00:42:31.439]  They tell him what he can and can't say.
[00:42:31.459 --> 00:42:33.040]  I guess they're like, it's going to pass, don't worry.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:34.981]  Go ahead and act like you're against it.
[00:42:36.882 --> 00:42:42.185]  What I hate is his going back and forth and him laughing at us.
[00:42:42.685 --> 00:42:43.866]  I'd love to love Glenn Beck.
[00:42:43.926 --> 00:42:45.006]  I'd love to love these guys.
[00:42:45.466 --> 00:42:47.648]  I just know it's a load of baloney.
[00:42:48.008 --> 00:42:53.411]  Because all of Rupert Murdoch's other companies, Rupert Murdoch admits, we played the video here, he put out a corporate press release.
[00:42:54.551 --> 00:43:01.396]  Showing all his movies, all his TV shows, and all his news articles, saying global warming's real, and it's going, Hi, I'm Rupert Murdoch.
[00:43:02.237 --> 00:43:04.098]  We're going to have a global tax, and I believe in it.
[00:43:04.338 --> 00:43:06.100]  And here's what I've been doing to make sure that happens.
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.441]  And then at Davos, he admits he tries to manipulate.
[00:43:08.722 --> 00:43:13.365]  So then there's this one guy, Beck, doing it, to kind of just grab the audience of patriots.
[00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:16.127]  Ah, it's just sick.
[00:43:17.748 --> 00:43:18.049]  Okay.
[00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:20.951]  Let me go ahead and
[00:43:24.019 --> 00:43:29.383]  I'm going to kind of prepare myself and get into this because I know this needs to go mega-viral, this video.
[00:43:29.904 --> 00:43:34.267]  Because I know everything we do on this TV show ends up going mega-viral, but I want this to go particularly mega-viral.
[00:43:34.287 --> 00:43:36.549]  Let me focus for one moment and then launch into it.
[00:43:37.489 --> 00:43:38.390]  Shifting gears mentally.
[00:43:43.474 --> 00:43:45.656]  Ron Paul has over 245 sponsors.
[00:43:45.676 --> 00:43:46.156]  If he gets 290, that is a
[00:43:52.811 --> 00:44:02.057]  Absolute majority in the House that will pass a bill to audit the private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve that we didn't have until 1913.
[00:44:02.337 --> 00:44:07.481]  When Ron Paul and other congressmen are on TV saying, audit the Fed or get rid of the Fed, he also has a bill to abolish it.
[00:44:07.741 --> 00:44:09.842]  They always say, well, how will we have taxes?
[00:44:10.143 --> 00:44:11.424]  How will America operate?
[00:44:11.684 --> 00:44:12.764]  How will we have money?
[00:44:13.585 --> 00:44:16.367]  How will the country survive?
[00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:18.268]  How will we be able to do anything?
[00:44:18.308 --> 00:44:22.411]  And Ron Paul's always at the Capitol, and he says, well, the Capitol I'm sitting in was built
[00:44:23.312 --> 00:44:28.417]  Before we had the Federal Reserve, we didn't have an income tax until 1913 when the Federal Reserve to pay the private bank.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.163]  Income tax wasn't 1% until the 1950s.
[00:44:35.204 --> 00:44:40.349]  Not one red cent of the money paid to the IRS goes to run the country.
[00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:41.651]  That's all the other taxes.
[00:44:43.547 --> 00:44:49.028]  This is all taxes on the debt to the private banks that issue it through their holding company, the Federal Reserve.
[00:44:49.468 --> 00:44:52.909]  And the news just kind of moves on, knowing the public that's too complex for them.
[00:44:53.889 --> 00:45:01.391]  But the issue is, even if the Federal Reserve is good, which it's obviously not, it's not above the law.
[00:45:01.511 --> 00:45:12.453]  Congress isn't above the law, the courts aren't above the law, the President isn't above the law, the Congress is supposed to have oversight over the courts, over the President, and over the coining and issuance of money and finance.
[00:45:13.311 --> 00:45:16.434]  Now, Congress has given up its authority over trade to the World Trade Organization.
[00:45:16.755 --> 00:45:19.117]  It's giving up its authority to the Federal Reserve right now.
[00:45:20.638 --> 00:45:28.486]  It did that first part of that with the October banker bailout that gave them secrecy and unlimited funds, and they've stolen $14.8 trillion according to Bloomberg.
[00:45:28.827 --> 00:45:35.553]  Now they want to set up a new bank of the world, the Federal Reserve, the local governorship, same legislation word for word being passed in Europe right now.
[00:45:36.394 --> 00:45:38.355]  And so, we're trying to audit the Fed.
[00:45:38.395 --> 00:45:43.297]  They're trying to fully take over anything connected to finance or that affects the economy.
[00:45:43.577 --> 00:45:50.299]  And they say in their own words, from a restaurant to a car dealership, from a factory to a private school.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:46:02.803]  Martial law, total control, just as the executive orders state, where the federal government can reorganize people into youth brigades, or work brigades, take over land, take over transportation, take over manufacturing.
[00:46:03.263 --> 00:46:12.546]  All those illegitimate executive powers concentrated illegitimately in the presidency since the National Security Act of 47, expanded by each subsequent president.
[00:46:13.026 --> 00:46:14.927]  The forced inoculation laws, all of it.
[00:46:15.127 --> 00:46:16.087]  That's coming up next hour.
[00:46:17.248 --> 00:46:17.868]  Big news there.
[00:46:20.049 --> 00:46:29.259]  That has all been taken from the Congress and the courts, transferred illegitimately into the Presidency, and now through the National Security Council and banking committees, transferred to the private Fed.
[00:46:29.279 --> 00:46:30.500]  And now they just want to make it official.
[00:46:32.982 --> 00:46:42.852]  Now, Bernanke got up yesterday before the House Banking Committee and was being questioned, and he said, look, you can't audit us, you can't look at us, or there will be a depression.
[00:46:43.783 --> 00:46:45.945]  So that's financial terrorism, just like in October.
[00:46:46.286 --> 00:46:49.149]  Pass my Banker Takeover Bill or there'll be a depression.
[00:46:49.429 --> 00:47:04.925]  And then they went into behind closed committee, Senator Inhofe said, and also other members of the House have come out and said, Brad Sherman on this show, not just on the House floor, and said that Paulson came in with a threat, taking orders,
[00:47:06.571 --> 00:47:22.123]  Uh, directly from Ben Bernanke, but he had Ben Bernanke with him, but it's come out in the memos that the threats are made by Paulson on behalf of Bernanke and former New York Fed Chairman Geithner, now Treasury Secretary, that there will be physical martial law if you don't do this.
[00:47:23.244 --> 00:47:25.926]  And that's why you're now seeing antagonism by the House towards him.
[00:47:26.266 --> 00:47:32.010]  Even though they're a bunch of crooks and thugs on average, they didn't like him coming in and saying, look, we'll just throw your butts out or arrest you.
[00:47:32.881 --> 00:47:38.303]  Just like the New York governor just said he'll arrest members of the legislature if they don't go vote the way he wants.
[00:47:38.423 --> 00:47:40.184]  That was in ABC News.
[00:47:40.204 --> 00:47:41.405]  Just, oh, he'll arrest them.
[00:47:41.445 --> 00:47:43.986]  See, everything is becoming crime world.
[00:47:44.006 --> 00:47:50.208]  You know, the velvet gloves tearing off the iron fist and we're really seeing what it is now.
[00:47:51.289 --> 00:47:52.629]  Right out in the open for everybody.
[00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:56.051]  So, to continue here to the key.
[00:47:57.682 --> 00:48:05.504]  We're saying, hey, the Congress has the right to coin, print the money, control the currency, the issuance of currency, credit, control the banks.
[00:48:06.004 --> 00:48:06.624]  That's its job.
[00:48:07.005 --> 00:48:07.665]  To regulate that.
[00:48:08.525 --> 00:48:12.666]  And the Fed says, no, that would be Congress seizing power dictatorially.
[00:48:13.446 --> 00:48:15.607]  When it's the private Federal Reserve that sees power.
[00:48:16.943 --> 00:48:27.265]  It was Congress that got bought off in 1913 with 11 senators voting on Christmas Eve at midnight, right before midnight, when nobody's there, they come in and criminally pass the Federal Reserve Act.
[00:48:27.745 --> 00:48:28.466]  They're criminals!
[00:48:28.626 --> 00:48:29.806]  This was a coup!
[00:48:30.646 --> 00:48:36.787]  And that coup stayed in place, but kind of sat back so people wouldn't notice the takeover, and then crept out and took over.
[00:48:37.388 --> 00:48:39.448]  And they've done that now, and now they're mopping up.
[00:48:40.808 --> 00:48:43.829]  So when we come back after this quick break, I am going to
[00:48:45.165 --> 00:48:51.029]  Play Bernanke saying Congress has no authority over the bank and saying nobody can audit them.
[00:48:51.889 --> 00:48:55.251]  Greenspan's on record saying the Fed's above the law, nobody can audit it.
[00:48:57.673 --> 00:49:02.896]  And then I'm going to read to you from the Constitution.
[00:49:02.916 --> 00:49:10.181]  The Congress shall have the power to coin money, regulate the value thereof, foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures.
[00:49:10.241 --> 00:49:12.182]  And then it goes on over the banks and everything else.
[00:49:13.905 --> 00:49:28.047]  This little con artist, this little flim flam man, this sleight of hand carnival magician sits up there like he's fooling five-year-old school kids with his shoddy
[00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:33.950]  Shoddy magic trick saying, oh, you're not allowed to look at me.
[00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:35.531]  You're not allowed to audit me.
[00:49:35.991 --> 00:49:37.532]  You're not allowed to investigate me.
[00:49:37.912 --> 00:49:39.613]  You're not allowed to look into what I'm doing.
[00:49:40.034 --> 00:49:41.214]  It'll destroy America.
[00:49:41.775 --> 00:49:42.655]  Financial terrorism.
[00:49:42.996 --> 00:49:45.377]  It's going to destroy the economy if you don't give us NAFTA and GATT.
[00:49:45.397 --> 00:49:46.178]  Destroys the economy.
[00:49:46.198 --> 00:49:49.100]  It's going to destroy the economy if you don't give us all these tax increases.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.641]  Then they get the tax increases, destroys it further.
[00:49:51.901 --> 00:49:53.741]  Destroy the economy if you don't give us unlimited power.
[00:49:53.982 --> 00:49:55.642]  We're going to be nuked by Iraq.
[00:49:55.742 --> 00:49:57.263]  They have WMDs if we don't invade.
[00:49:57.643 --> 00:50:02.064]  Always conning, always lying, always scamming, always terrorizing the public.
[00:50:03.064 --> 00:50:09.286]  We're going to play this amazing video, the audio for radio listeners, the video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers right now, when we get back.
[00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:13.368]  And if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, it's 15 cents a day, folks.
[00:50:14.474 --> 00:50:21.657]  You get all my films super high quality, the live TV show every day, the Sunday show we're about to be doing out of this studio, and a lot more.
[00:50:22.458 --> 00:50:25.539]  By the way, Jason's going to be doing a Sunday show soon after me, so that should be interesting.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.580]  It is all coming up.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:39.006]  I'll break down the chutzpah, the bravado, the arrogance, the hubris, the corruption, the in-your-face arrogance of this creature when we get back, telling you he's God over Congress.
[00:50:41.727 --> 00:50:50.774]  We have just received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[00:50:51.054 --> 00:51:04.284]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement for all GCN listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands.
[00:51:04.565 --> 00:51:05.565]  The number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[00:51:08.988 --> 00:51:13.311]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[00:51:13.651 --> 00:51:18.414]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[00:51:18.614 --> 00:51:27.339]  American Tax Settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[00:51:27.719 --> 00:51:32.422]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[00:51:36.084 --> 00:51:39.905]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[00:51:40.065 --> 00:51:40.885]  Call today!
[00:51:40.905 --> 00:51:42.726]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:42.886 --> 00:51:47.867]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[00:51:48.267 --> 00:51:50.348]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[00:51:50.688 --> 00:51:59.770]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:00.190]  We're good.
[00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:20.031]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this.
[00:52:20.291 --> 00:52:25.635]  The call is free and in 10 minutes they will show you how much you can save right over the phone with one simple call.
[00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:32.521]  Let the Bailout Group bail you out of debt, reduce your payments by up to 60% and save you thousands of dollars today.
[00:52:32.761 --> 00:52:33.701]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554.
[00:52:33.721 --> 00:52:33.782]  800-324-6554.
[00:52:33.802 --> 00:52:34.262]  The Bailout Group.
[00:52:41.247 --> 00:52:42.308]  Economy have you down?
[00:52:42.508 --> 00:52:44.049]  Scared you might lose your job?
[00:52:44.189 --> 00:52:46.090]  Worried how you will provide for your family?
[00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:48.171]  Do you worry where your money will come from?
[00:52:48.391 --> 00:52:51.393]  You know that the economy is getting worse, but there is hope!
[00:52:51.713 --> 00:52:55.976]  Robert Beatles' new book, Here's What You Do, tells you what to do and how to do it!

[00:52:59.798 --> 00:53:00.519]  And the best part?

[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.381]  Don't be the victim, be a victor!

[00:53:06.743 --> 00:53:08.384]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:53:08.624 --> 00:53:09.905]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:53:10.785 --> 00:53:12.286]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:53:12.406 --> 00:53:16.689]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[00:53:31.999 --> 00:53:32.279]  That's 877-479-8178.
[00:53:32.299 --> 00:53:32.339]  877-479-8178.
[00:53:40.725 --> 00:53:40.828]  Yeah.
[00:54:04.468 --> 00:54:07.490]  Thank you for joining us, continuing with Bernanke's arrogance.
[00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:13.555]  Think about it, offshore banks openly running everything, hijacking the whole economy, engineering the collapse.
[00:54:14.135 --> 00:54:19.959]  They're pushing and paying off the Congress openly to have the new global carbon tax paid to them.
[00:54:19.979 --> 00:54:23.542]  And how dare the Congress talk about some transparency?
[00:54:23.702 --> 00:54:26.444]  Oh, if anybody knew what we were doing, we would go bankrupt.
[00:54:27.645 --> 00:54:29.526]  And then he lies and says, oh we have a website.
[00:54:29.886 --> 00:54:31.487]  Everything's on record at the website.
[00:54:31.888 --> 00:54:33.389]  Just like Senator Sanders.
[00:54:34.189 --> 00:54:35.750]  He told Senator Sanders that a few months ago.
[00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:36.771]  It's in the new Obama film.
[00:54:38.192 --> 00:54:39.312]  And Sanders said, no it's not.
[00:54:39.493 --> 00:54:40.293]  Tell me where the money went.
[00:54:40.313 --> 00:54:41.454]  He goes, oh well that part isn't there.
[00:54:41.714 --> 00:54:42.394]  That's a secret.
[00:54:43.695 --> 00:54:45.196]  So he lies and says it's all public.
[00:54:45.216 --> 00:54:46.237]  And you go, okay, well where's the money?
[00:54:46.697 --> 00:54:47.418]  I won't tell you that.
[00:54:47.838 --> 00:54:48.438]  It's all public.
[00:54:48.458 --> 00:54:50.179]  We're the Federal Reserve and what our address is.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:52.341]  Never been an audit.
[00:54:53.203 --> 00:54:56.825]  They have a joke on it of chairs and pencils, but not where the money goes.
[00:54:56.865 --> 00:54:57.386]  I'm not kidding.
[00:54:57.406 --> 00:55:04.350]  Of refrigerators and pencils and desks and chairs and water coolers and light fixtures.
[00:55:05.531 --> 00:55:07.892]  But it's just a holding company for the private banks.
[00:55:08.232 --> 00:55:12.035]  And then Bernanke gets up and, well, here's the video clip.
[00:55:14.025 --> 00:55:15.286]  Thank you.
[00:55:15.406 --> 00:55:15.686]  Thank you.
[00:55:32.515 --> 00:55:42.221]  And refused or declined to disclose the seriousness of the problems that were being faced by the Bank of America and Merrill Lynch at that time.
[00:55:43.702 --> 00:55:52.848]  What would you say to the majority of this Congress who have now co-sponsored the bill to require audits of the Federal Reserve
[00:55:53.428 --> 00:56:06.709]  Do you feel that the Federal Reserve is operating with too much secrecy and too much refusal to disclose information that you have to other federal banking regulators?
[00:56:07.406 --> 00:56:15.234]  The Federal Reserve has made enormous strides in the last year under my chairmanship to expand the information that we release.
[00:56:15.314 --> 00:56:19.378]  We release monthly information on all the various programs that we have.
[00:56:19.959 --> 00:56:24.483]  We've developed a website and a monthly report that involves all kinds of information.
[00:56:24.523 --> 00:56:25.865]  We think we are quite transparent.
[00:56:27.446 --> 00:56:31.331]  We're happy to work with Congress if they have further concerns about any of our programs.
[00:56:32.492 --> 00:56:39.180]  We're more than happy to work with you to make sure that you're comfortable, that they are well managed and are serving a public purpose.
[00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:47.030]  Do you think it would cause problems for the Fed or for the economy if that legislation was to pass?
[00:56:47.310 --> 00:57:13.163]  My concern about the legislation is that if the GAO is auditing not only the operational aspects of our programs and the details of the programs, but is making judgments about our policy decisions, that would effectively be a takeover of monetary policy by the Congress, a repudiation of the independence of the Federal Reserve, which would be highly destructive to the stability of the financial system, the dollar, and our national economic situation.
[00:57:14.384 --> 00:57:14.624]  Thank you.
[00:57:17.461 --> 00:57:18.902]  The Fed's independence?
[00:57:18.942 --> 00:57:21.463]  God forbid Congress control monetary policy.
[00:57:21.903 --> 00:57:24.584]  Here's the pocket constitutions we send out free with all the orders.
[00:57:25.524 --> 00:57:26.545]  Article 1, U.S.
[00:57:26.605 --> 00:57:27.325]  Constitution.
[00:57:28.926 --> 00:57:32.307]  Article 1, United States Constitution.
[00:57:33.248 --> 00:57:35.488]  Article 1, We the People.
[00:57:35.548 --> 00:57:36.209]  Ever heard of that?
[00:57:37.629 --> 00:57:40.470]  And then you got Section 8 right here.
[00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:44.732]  I'm going to read Section 8 to everybody here on air.
[00:57:44.752 --> 00:57:46.193]  These are the powers of Congress.
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:58:00.749]  The coin money regulate the value thereof and a foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting, that'd be Bernanke, the securities and current coin of the United States.
[00:58:03.111 --> 00:58:03.871]  And it goes on.
[00:58:05.532 --> 00:58:10.175]  I mean, Congress has the power of the purse, that's why they vote for the bills and the funding.
[00:58:11.616 --> 00:58:14.799]  Oh, but God forbid anybody do that, we'll have a depression if we do.
[00:58:15.219 --> 00:58:15.879]  Bernanke,
[00:58:17.091 --> 00:58:17.972]  Everybody's learning.
[00:58:18.553 --> 00:58:19.614]  You run a criminal group.
[00:58:23.739 --> 00:58:25.341]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:26.262 --> 00:58:28.585]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:31.078 --> 00:58:32.179]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:32.459 --> 00:58:34.240]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:35.100]  Well, you should.
[00:58:35.441 --> 00:58:39.683]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:58:39.923 --> 00:58:40.403]  That's right.
[00:58:40.724 --> 00:58:49.188]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:58:49.388 --> 00:58:50.629]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:58:50.749 --> 00:58:51.890]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:57.734]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:58:58.074 --> 00:59:04.599]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:59:04.979 --> 00:59:10.182]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:59:10.483 --> 00:59:11.623]  This is real.
[00:59:11.964 --> 00:59:12.684]  Don't miss out.
[00:59:13.004 --> 00:59:19.869]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:21.370]  And get your free handgun.

[00:59:23.912 --> 00:59:27.436]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:59:27.616 --> 00:59:30.598]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:59:34.182 --> 00:59:36.083]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:36.564 --> 00:59:39.366]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:54.186 --> 01:00:03.768]  We're now into the final hour of this very important radio show.
[01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:07.389]  They're going to end debate in the next 30 minutes or so.
[01:00:07.429 --> 01:00:09.609]  They were supposed to already end it, but they're going over.
[01:00:10.729 --> 01:00:19.691]  For the bill to take over the entire economy of the United States.
[01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:24.210]  And if you want to call and say no to H.R.
[01:00:25.071 --> 01:00:40.823]  2998 and to the American Clean Water Restoration Act and the rest of it, it's all, that's an open federal takeover of all water, waterways, below ground water, the above surface land, that bill's going on as well.
[01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:43.487]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:48.831]  Give them a call and say no to the American Clean Energy and Security Act 2009.
[01:00:49.472 --> 01:00:51.053]  What a nice name, like the Patriot Act.
[01:00:51.073 --> 01:00:53.555]  It's totally unpatriotic, so they call it patriotic.
[01:00:53.615 --> 01:00:54.356]  Ends the Bill of Rights.
[01:00:54.796 --> 01:01:01.302]  Well, this thing allows the bureaucrats to run and tax and control and have Enron-style carbon credits ripping everybody off.
[01:01:02.683 --> 01:01:03.624]  I got some other news, too.
[01:01:03.824 --> 01:01:08.188]  H1N1 swine flu has infected an estimated one million in the U.S.
[01:01:08.928 --> 01:01:09.609]  and up on
[01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:15.351]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:17.012 --> 01:01:30.261]  It is in the executive order that Bush signed that Obama has continued for forced inoculations nationwide under Level 6 pandemic.
[01:01:30.482 --> 01:01:33.143]  Well, they say we're under Level 6, so now they want to forcibly inject.
[01:01:33.444 --> 01:01:34.865]  They claim they have the law to do it.
[01:01:35.714 --> 01:01:36.414]  An executive order.
[01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:40.497]  And a popular website actually called up an Arkansas official.
[01:01:40.537 --> 01:01:43.939]  A lawyer sat there, you know, citing this case and that case.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.742]  So we're going to go over that as well.
[01:01:47.942 --> 01:01:51.324]  Arkansas State Health Department mandatory vaccines are constitutional.
[01:01:53.817 --> 01:02:07.431]  And then I actually went and printed up the CBS News story, DHS Gets Guidelines for Possible Swine Flu Outbreaks, and it says in this article, forced inoculations nationwide, and now the Canadian papers are saying, oh a million Americans have it.
[01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:09.273]  It means you have a virus that's harmless.
[01:02:10.097 --> 01:02:13.778]  But that we're going to have to forcibly inoculate the Canadians and the Americans and the Europeans.
[01:02:14.218 --> 01:02:16.799]  DHS sets guidelines for possible swine flu quarantines.
[01:02:17.719 --> 01:02:22.680]  They'll probably start the next wave of fear in the fall, then try to forcibly inject people.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.240]  But most of the idiots are going to line up and accept it.
[01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:29.921]  So that is coming up as well this hour.
[01:02:30.482 --> 01:02:34.522]  But I do want to take calls, but I've got to go to them quickly.
[01:02:34.823 --> 01:02:36.503]  Dave in California, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.000]  Hi, Alex.
[01:02:38.581 --> 01:02:38.901]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:41.462]  Long live free Pop Tardio, brother.
[01:02:41.482 --> 01:02:46.164]  My whole planet, Pop Tardio.
[01:02:46.184 --> 01:02:46.565]  Go ahead.
[01:02:46.585 --> 01:02:47.265]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:48.446]  That's exactly where we are.
[01:02:48.466 --> 01:02:53.168]  Anyway, you put up a video on InfoWars yesterday that just did my heart good.
[01:02:53.568 --> 01:02:57.410]  The one tens of thousands of Chinese fight the police in Hsinchu.
[01:02:58.671 --> 01:03:03.013]  Yeah, they haven't had their water fluoridated, though China's now starting that, so they'll be behaving now.
[01:03:04.338 --> 01:03:05.579]  Well, yeah, I suppose so.
[01:03:05.639 --> 01:03:14.808]  But, you know, Mark Kornke talks about moose hunting, and to me that's the perfect example of it, except all the Chinese needed were rocks to make the moose panic and flee.
[01:03:15.368 --> 01:03:17.831]  And imagine if they had firearms like we do.
[01:03:20.523 --> 01:03:29.928]  But you understand the globalist plan to let us have a war here, break down, then without food and water later, six months later, we'll beg for the I-4 troops.
[01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:35.751]  We've just got to realize that we're trying to wake up as many people as we can so we can try to avert this.
[01:03:36.491 --> 01:03:40.053]  But, yes, it's going to turn into that.
[01:03:40.073 --> 01:03:41.394]  They're not going to stop.
[01:03:41.794 --> 01:03:47.777]  They're taking everybody's land, everybody's kids, everybody's jobs, and just laughing at us and hiring more cops.
[01:03:47.997 --> 01:03:49.018]  The economy's imploding.
[01:03:49.198 --> 01:03:50.919]  They're hiring more cops to squeeze us.
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:56.442]  Well, if possible, sir, would you please have Mark back on sometime soon?
[01:03:56.662 --> 01:03:59.664]  Everything's tending toward armed conflict and he is the expert on it.
[01:04:01.365 --> 01:04:03.226]  You know, I'll think about doing that.
[01:04:03.266 --> 01:04:04.126]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:20.509]  I've never been invited on any of the things he does, but I'm not here to go out and sit there and... The main rule with me is no more Mr. Nice Guy.
[01:04:20.529 --> 01:04:25.773]  I've always been friendly and nice to everybody, but when that doesn't happen back to me, then the door shuts.
[01:04:26.593 --> 01:04:28.094]  But Mark's a nice guy, smart guy.
[01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:32.797]  It's just that he can call for armed rebellion on his own website and stuff.
[01:04:33.137 --> 01:04:35.099]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:35.119 --> 01:04:35.479]  Stay with us.

[01:04:47.882 --> 01:04:50.643]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:04:50.843 --> 01:04:53.864]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:04:53.884 --> 01:04:58.626]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:04:58.846 --> 01:04:59.746]  If you simply prepare.
[01:04:59.966 --> 01:05:02.887]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[01:06:49.149 --> 01:07:00.577]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:06.641]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.

[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:51.801]  You want answers?
[01:07:52.561 --> 01:07:53.442]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:53.462 --> 01:07:57.807]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:58.307 --> 01:08:02.411]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:02.631 --> 01:08:06.776]  I want to go back to your calls to Daniel, Jack, Nick.
[01:08:08.388 --> 01:08:13.350]  And then I'm going to get into the other news because there's a lot of it and it's important in the time we have left in this Friday edition.
[01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:16.091]  I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:08:16.511 --> 01:08:19.753]  in the aftermath of... Will Congress even be able to read the bill?
[01:08:20.193 --> 01:08:21.893]  They weren't allowed to read the stimulus package.
[01:08:21.913 --> 01:08:23.354]  They weren't allowed to read the Patriot Act.
[01:08:23.674 --> 01:08:25.415]  They won't be allowed to read the banking reform bill.
[01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:30.738]  It's gone from 200 pages to 500 to 600 to 800 to 1,100 to 1,200 to 1,300.
[01:08:30.778 --> 01:08:35.182]  They say 1,300 more pages were added last night, hundreds more today.
[01:08:35.542 --> 01:08:37.683]  Other pages being pulled out, stuck in.
[01:08:38.084 --> 01:08:39.425]  They won't publish what it is.
[01:08:40.746 --> 01:08:42.427]  But yes, we posted video.
[01:08:43.795 --> 01:08:51.663]  Of, we posted a lot of these, of Chinese with sticks and stones, when the police get caught killing citizens, they go out, attack the police, burn down the police stations.
[01:08:52.044 --> 01:08:53.145]  And I say they have a lot of spirit.
[01:08:53.805 --> 01:08:57.729]  And the Chinese government's a corrupt, wicked government, and their people have a right to fight back against it.
[01:08:58.891 --> 01:09:06.859]  And when that caller calls in and says, have this guy on or have that guy on, the caller was Dave, you know, I like the people you're talking about, and I like the work they do.
[01:09:08.635 --> 01:09:11.939]  But then people are always jabbing me saying, Alex doesn't call for armed revolt.
[01:09:12.099 --> 01:09:12.780]  Alex is bad.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.002]  Alex doesn't, you know, do this.
[01:09:14.062 --> 01:09:15.543]  And I'm not talking about the person you were mentioning.
[01:09:16.264 --> 01:09:19.708]  I'm talking about overall, people calling for armed revolt.
[01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:22.332]  Or getting close to calling for it.
[01:09:23.673 --> 01:09:28.139]  Within two hours of Ploplosky killing those cops.
[01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:40.891]  Within hours of that happening, the Southern Poverty Law Center had fed one person's name out of the hundreds of sites that turned out to be Fox News, CNN, Stormfront.
[01:09:41.773 --> 01:09:46.979]  One name was fed to the police and the news media by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:09:47.599 --> 01:09:47.719]  Me.
[01:09:48.735 --> 01:09:50.155]  They want to come after me.
[01:09:51.076 --> 01:09:58.738]  And I got all these big newspapers calling me up going, what about Richard McCaslin that went in the Bohemian Grove with guns and set things on fire?
[01:09:59.138 --> 01:10:00.118]  When nobody was there, by the way.
[01:10:00.138 --> 01:10:01.118]  It looks like a setup to me.
[01:10:01.578 --> 01:10:02.219]  This Marine.
[01:10:02.819 --> 01:10:04.239]  What about Poplaski?
[01:10:04.279 --> 01:10:05.159]  What about this?
[01:10:05.339 --> 01:10:07.200]  Oh, do you need to be arrested?
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.340]  You know, basically.
[01:10:09.661 --> 01:10:11.021]  And they are circling me.
[01:10:11.161 --> 01:10:13.882]  I'm at a level nobody's ever gotten into in the patriot movement.
[01:10:13.902 --> 01:10:14.822]  And let me tell you, it isn't fun.
[01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:26.056]  And I've always supported everybody else when they get set up or sent to jail and told people to support and send money to people and stuff and then not even by that individual but by people around them I get criticized.
[01:10:26.757 --> 01:10:27.477]  That I don't like.
[01:10:28.305 --> 01:10:47.264]  When I just give and give and give and give, and then always the people, and separate, not Mark that you were talking about, but other talk shows, people say, Alex, that Alex Jones needs to call for war and death and shootin' war and moose hunting, and I always quote Mark on that, you know, about how
[01:10:48.365 --> 01:10:52.946]  There's tens of millions of patriots, only a few million police and military, and most of them are actually on our side now.
[01:10:52.966 --> 01:10:54.807]  And it's like moose hunting up north.
[01:10:55.427 --> 01:11:00.748]  You know, in New York and Michigan and places, there's so few moose per hunters, they have a lottery.
[01:11:00.768 --> 01:11:03.689]  Maybe one out of twenty people gets a moose hunting ticket.
[01:11:04.389 --> 01:11:11.671]  And it tells you if it's a sow or if it's a buck or whatever they call the male and female moose.
[01:11:12.872 --> 01:11:13.752]  I think it's sow.
[01:11:13.892 --> 01:11:15.292]  Look up female moose.
[01:11:16.093 --> 01:11:16.873]  But the point is,
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:26.607]  You know, it's a... In foxes, the male's called a dog, and the female's called a vixen.
[01:11:26.627 --> 01:11:29.090]  I mean, every species has got different names.
[01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:33.394]  A gaggle's a certain number of crows, a murder's another number.
[01:11:33.774 --> 01:11:34.175]  What is it?
[01:11:35.957 --> 01:11:36.577]  It's a cow!
[01:11:36.857 --> 01:11:37.458]  Okay, the cow.
[01:11:40.001 --> 01:11:42.924]  I know there's a whole bunch of mammal species where the female's called a sow.
[01:11:43.911 --> 01:11:44.611]  Like whales.
[01:11:45.472 --> 01:11:47.854]  Some species of whale they're called, the mother's called a sow.
[01:11:48.474 --> 01:11:50.495]  Other species of whale, in fact, look up female whales.
[01:11:50.876 --> 01:11:52.457]  It's only certain species are called sows.
[01:11:52.897 --> 01:11:53.737]  I can't keep track of that.
[01:11:53.797 --> 01:11:56.939]  I know that people think of a female pig as a sow.
[01:11:58.741 --> 01:12:13.290]  I've got important news to cover and I'm covering sows here, but I guess that's kind of a... The issue is, there's only maybe one out of ten guys, depending on the lottery, what the Fish and Wildlife people come up with every year, might be one out of five people gets to hunt a moose that goes in for the lottery, one out of a hundred, whatever.
[01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:19.032]  Sometimes when the deer numbers are down in Texas, in certain counties they have a lottery.
[01:12:19.692 --> 01:12:27.535]  And not everybody gets a permit on the wildlife management, as they call it.
[01:12:29.316 --> 01:12:33.518]  So, the analogy here is there's 10 million Patriots at least.
[01:12:33.578 --> 01:12:39.120]  If each Patriot goes out and bags just one moose, there'll be no more moose left.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.501]  There's more Patriots than there are moose.
[01:12:42.581 --> 01:12:43.542]  Moose being the police.
[01:12:44.275 --> 01:12:46.616]  I don't want that to happen.
[01:12:46.656 --> 01:12:49.156]  I don't want that to go to that point.
[01:12:49.416 --> 01:12:52.157]  Plus, I'm on the air waking people up about the general knowledge.
[01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:53.858]  I get the folks woken up.
[01:12:54.358 --> 01:12:55.378]  I get them energized.
[01:12:55.518 --> 01:12:56.238]  I get them awake.
[01:12:56.698 --> 01:12:59.239]  I get them to be aware of what's going on and happening.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:09.682]  And everybody ought to be happy in the Liberty, Patriot, 9-11 Truth Movement, Anti-New Order Movement, Libertarian Movement, because everybody I talk to says 80% of the folks getting woke up are from this show.
[01:13:10.222 --> 01:13:12.543]  By the grace of God, we've hit the zeitgeist.
[01:13:13.547 --> 01:13:15.249]  And so I wake the people up.
[01:13:15.309 --> 01:13:16.851]  My listeners spread the word and wake people up.
[01:13:17.112 --> 01:13:17.913]  This is the engine.
[01:13:18.614 --> 01:13:21.978]  And then that increases the movement overall.
[01:13:23.019 --> 01:13:27.064]  But then there's kind of this paradoxical thing of a lot of the people
[01:13:28.032 --> 01:13:37.081]  You know, the common folks love me, but then a lot of people in the movement itself kind of get envious and jealous of me because some of them aren't in it for the right reasons.
[01:13:37.101 --> 01:13:39.724]  And then others don't agree with me politically or this idea or that idea.
[01:13:40.104 --> 01:13:43.147]  We've got to keep the ammunition going downrange at the New World Order.
[01:13:44.028 --> 01:13:44.869]  That's the issue.
[01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:46.030]  That's the target.
[01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:47.612]  That's who's got to be dealt with.
[01:13:48.649 --> 01:13:50.131]  And a lot of it's just flat-out business.
[01:13:50.391 --> 01:14:01.802]  I mean, I've had other little networks and stuff call up all my sponsors and try to get them, and if I just tell the sponsor when they're asking me, well, is there any listeners, I go, no, but, you know, on this other thing, but do what you want, that turns into me doing this or that.
[01:14:01.823 --> 01:14:05.646]  You know, that's, a lot of people, this is a business.
[01:14:05.706 --> 01:14:08.189]  To me, this is a total mission, a total commitment.
[01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:09.470]  I realize my life's on the line.
[01:14:09.851 --> 01:14:11.613]  I passed the point of no return a long time ago.
[01:14:12.847 --> 01:14:15.428]  And I'm committed, come hell or high water, to beat this New World Order.
[01:14:15.928 --> 01:14:18.549]  Okay, let's shift gears since I got off into Sal's.
[01:14:21.391 --> 01:14:26.413]  Well, let me just finish by saying, I genuinely believe in keeping this peaceful as long as we can to grow our numbers.
[01:14:26.793 --> 01:14:32.495]  We're actually building strength every day, as the enemy gets more and more exposed and unveiled as criminal and out of control.
[01:14:33.175 --> 01:14:37.257]  Now, maybe people can intellectually argue and debate with me about those facts, but so do the Founding Fathers.
[01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:39.038]  We can still be friends about that.
[01:14:40.535 --> 01:14:43.337]  About whether this is the time, whether this is the place.
[01:14:43.597 --> 01:14:53.225]  When you start seeing more government massacres and massacres of people rioting and demonstrating, and when you see more abuses and more WACOs, that's when it's going to happen.
[01:14:53.545 --> 01:14:56.908]  And a lot of people that wanted war, once it starts, aren't going to like it.
[01:14:58.049 --> 01:15:07.376]  I'm doing everything I can so that if ever comes the point where I've got to go out and lead people or whatever it takes,
[01:15:09.076 --> 01:15:11.317]  And I'm ready to line up at Bunker Hill, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:11.337 --> 01:15:12.738]  I'm ready to vote with my muskets.
[01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:19.481]  But I've got to do everything before I get to that point.
[01:15:23.363 --> 01:15:31.848]  This is like a jiu-jitsu match, and we're grappling, we're wrestling, and we're starting to get the momentum in the fight.
[01:15:34.178 --> 01:15:39.003]  And the enemy wants to get out our grapple and stand up straight and go ahead and have a full-on battle right now.
[01:15:39.584 --> 01:15:40.265]  We're the one.
[01:15:40.325 --> 01:15:41.827]  Time is on our side.
[01:15:42.387 --> 01:15:43.328]  Like the Rolling Stones song.
[01:15:43.348 --> 01:15:45.110]  You've got to pull that up on YouTube, play a clip of it.
[01:15:45.471 --> 01:15:47.413]  Time is on our side.
[01:15:47.773 --> 01:15:48.975]  Boy, that's some really good singing, isn't it?
[01:15:50.526 --> 01:15:52.026]  Call your representatives.
[01:15:52.246 --> 01:15:53.687]  Shoot down the bill.
[01:15:53.727 --> 01:15:54.727]  We've had many victories.
[01:15:54.807 --> 01:15:56.387]  It may pass and it goes to the Senate.
[01:15:56.587 --> 01:16:00.828]  But by the time it gets in there, we'll find out then all the unpopular provisions.
[01:16:00.868 --> 01:16:05.029]  But that'll take a week or so for folks to ferret through 1,600 plus pages.
[01:16:06.249 --> 01:16:06.870]  Or whatever it is.
[01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:07.670]  They say it's growing.
[01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:11.591]  And then, we've got to
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:16.561]  Look at those provisions.
[01:16:16.681 --> 01:16:18.222]  Try to make the Senate strip them out.
[01:16:18.642 --> 01:16:19.983]  Most of it won't be stripped out.
[01:16:20.463 --> 01:16:21.864]  But at least we're trying to beat it today.
[01:16:21.904 --> 01:16:23.145]  We're doing the best job we can.
[01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:27.728]  People thought this wouldn't pass because in polls, 80 plus percent of Americans are against it.
[01:16:27.948 --> 01:16:29.669]  They don't care.
[01:16:29.689 --> 01:16:33.572]  99 percent, depending on the poll, 98 percent were against the bank bailout.
[01:16:33.612 --> 01:16:34.032]  It happened.
[01:16:35.333 --> 01:16:36.073]  They just don't care.
[01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:36.654]  They're criminals.
[01:16:38.373 --> 01:16:40.354]  But let them show everybody they're dictators.
[01:16:40.394 --> 01:16:41.594]  Let everybody see it.
[01:16:42.214 --> 01:16:45.295]  Now these bastards are getting so bold, they're openly announcing foreign troops.
[01:16:47.116 --> 01:16:48.296]  Educate people about this.
[01:16:48.376 --> 01:16:49.957]  Tell them, speak out now.
[01:16:50.237 --> 01:16:53.758]  They're going to shut down the communications once this goes hot.
[01:16:54.338 --> 01:17:01.361]  We need to, whether you want to come fast or slow, spend the time you got to warn as many people as you can.
[01:17:03.154 --> 01:17:06.736]  You know, I'm not spending time trying to move out of Austin to the country to protect myself for all of this.
[01:17:06.776 --> 01:17:10.199]  I'm just staying here because I don't have the time and energy to even move or find a place or get out of here.
[01:17:11.179 --> 01:17:15.322]  And I'm hopefully we can expose them and they'll kind of back off and this thing won't go to an all-out war.
[01:17:17.984 --> 01:17:26.069]  There's a lot of people who've got a kind of got like a Rambo complex where they want to want to see this conflict in the U.S.
[01:17:26.129 --> 01:17:28.171]  and the globalists think they're ready for it.
[01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:29.071]  I believe they're going to lose.
[01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:30.913]  But
[01:17:33.942 --> 01:17:35.123]  I just can't believe it's going to happen.
[01:17:35.163 --> 01:17:36.504]  I mean, it's pretty much going to happen.
[01:17:36.524 --> 01:17:38.505]  The more I look at things, it's going to be hellish.
[01:17:38.986 --> 01:17:45.770]  So we do post things like that from China to show you these fools email me and say, if we have war with the government, they got better equipment.
[01:17:46.051 --> 01:17:49.873]  Nothing can stop guerrilla warfare, ladies and gentlemen, in a nation disarmed.
[01:17:50.174 --> 01:17:52.275]  The issue is they want to put their cashless grid in.
[01:17:52.295 --> 01:17:53.336]  That's five to ten years.
[01:17:53.716 --> 01:17:55.217]  Once that's in, it'll be even harder.
[01:17:57.879 --> 01:17:58.980]  So it's an equilibrium.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.561]  So I'm fighting them putting the grid in.
[01:18:00.581 --> 01:18:01.622]  We're trying to slow that down.
[01:18:02.745 --> 01:18:05.406]  So there's some arguments for the longer we wait, the worse it is.
[01:18:05.426 --> 01:18:09.668]  There's other arguments for the longer they wait, the worse it is for them.
[01:18:10.948 --> 01:18:12.789]  I've seen their own white papers and a lot of their own statements.
[01:18:12.829 --> 01:18:14.810]  They believe the longer they wait, the harder it is on them.
[01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:17.771]  That's why they want to go ahead and get it on in a combat situation now.
[01:18:20.192 --> 01:18:21.392]  These are important subjects.
[01:18:21.632 --> 01:18:23.973]  Maybe I should have folks like Mark and people on about that.
[01:18:25.274 --> 01:18:25.634]  It's just...
[01:18:28.115 --> 01:18:29.336]  I need to continue to broadcast.
[01:18:29.356 --> 01:18:31.397]  I need to continue to put the information out here.
[01:18:32.037 --> 01:18:35.860]  I've already had the FBI and Secret Service here at my offices and I've told people that and they didn't believe it.
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.000]  Now it's been all over the newspapers.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.821]  I mean, I've been physically attacked.
[01:18:39.141 --> 01:18:42.884]  I mean, I am at the very tip of the spear here and I'm trying.
[01:18:43.684 --> 01:18:45.225]  I'm not a George Washington, folks.
[01:18:46.306 --> 01:18:46.706]  Okay?
[01:18:49.227 --> 01:18:51.669]  I'm one of the political minds.
[01:18:52.802 --> 01:18:54.083]  About how to wake the people up.
[01:18:54.484 --> 01:19:00.850]  I'm more of a, I'm not trying to parallel myself with these people, but in the modern age of resistance, I'm more of a Sam Adams type.
[01:19:02.552 --> 01:19:05.175]  In that I'm out there setting bushfires in the minds of men.
[01:19:05.215 --> 01:19:08.598]  I'm out there running a media operation, getting broadsheets out to people.
[01:19:09.259 --> 01:19:09.760]  You understand?
[01:19:11.587 --> 01:19:17.869]  And so, I'm just there trying to wake up as many people as I can to build our numbers while I watch the enemy getting ready to move on us.
[01:19:17.909 --> 01:19:18.249]  Wake up!
[01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:18.670]  Wake up!
[01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:18.990]  Come on!
[01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.690]  The enemy's coming!
[01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:20.570]  The enemy's coming!
[01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:21.151]  The enemy's coming!
[01:19:21.411 --> 01:19:23.151]  I'm up here on the parapet warning the enemy's coming.
[01:19:23.171 --> 01:19:27.073]  People are saying, well, soldier, climb down the wall and run out and fight the enemy out there.
[01:19:27.793 --> 01:19:28.993]  Hell, we know the enemy's coming.
[01:19:29.334 --> 01:19:30.334]  I'm here trying to get a sleep.
[01:19:30.494 --> 01:19:34.255]  And all these people that call for war and bloodshed, you never see them out shooting anybody.
[01:19:35.136 --> 01:19:35.896]  You ever notice that?
[01:19:35.936 --> 01:19:38.197]  It's kill, kill, war, war, death, death.
[01:19:38.697 --> 01:19:39.697]  You need to do it, Alex.
[01:19:39.737 --> 01:19:40.738]  You need to go out and do it.
[01:19:41.761 --> 01:19:48.585]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:19:48.885 --> 01:20:04.794]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:20:05.094 --> 01:20:10.239]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:20:10.459 --> 01:20:16.744]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:20:16.984 --> 01:20:20.608]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:20:20.868 --> 01:20:23.450]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:28.935]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:20:29.235 --> 01:20:31.836]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:20:31.896 --> 01:20:34.096]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:20:34.116 --> 01:20:36.577]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:20:36.617 --> 01:20:40.999]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:43.259]  It is a big idea.
[01:20:43.279 --> 01:20:45.400]  A new world order.
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:50.461]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:51.001 --> 01:20:53.162]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:53.842 --> 01:20:55.963]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:56.604 --> 01:20:59.049]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:07.123]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:21:10.143 --> 01:21:15.106]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:21:15.587 --> 01:21:19.049]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:21:19.449 --> 01:21:21.931]  Dillberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:21:22.031 --> 01:21:23.172]  Most people have no idea.
[01:21:23.192 --> 01:21:23.932]  They're not after money.
[01:21:23.952 --> 01:21:25.053]  They have all the money they need.
[01:21:25.253 --> 01:21:25.954]  They're after power.
[01:21:25.994 --> 01:21:27.074]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.422]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:21:38.902 --> 01:21:39.943]  You have been warned.
[01:21:40.904 --> 01:21:41.344]  Gold.
[01:21:41.684 --> 01:21:42.965]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:43.225 --> 01:21:49.329]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:49.489 --> 01:21:53.332]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:53.672 --> 01:21:55.573]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:55.613 --> 01:21:57.915]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:58.055 --> 01:22:02.978]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a feeble
[01:22:02.978 --> 01:22:03.238]  I think so.
[01:22:33.098 --> 01:22:35.783]  About owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:22:35.923 --> 01:22:36.965]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:40.603 --> 01:22:43.964]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:22:44.124 --> 01:22:49.325]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:22:49.506 --> 01:22:54.267]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:22:54.467 --> 01:23:05.350]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:23:05.730 --> 01:23:11.275]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:23:11.475 --> 01:23:17.561]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:23:17.721 --> 01:23:18.342]  What about you?
[01:23:18.582 --> 01:23:20.484]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[01:23:30.012 --> 01:23:31.353]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[01:23:47.104 --> 01:23:54.950]  Okay, the LA Times is reporting right now, H1N1 swine flu has infected an estimated 1 million in the US.
[01:23:56.656 --> 01:24:03.920]  See, I saw them pre-hyping flu, and I said two months before they launched that staged attack, I said, I believe they're going to use flu.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.783]  And then Baxter Pharmaceutical was involved, mixing live, weaponized bird flu with regular vaccines, but got caught.
[01:24:11.263 --> 01:24:12.244]  That was in Bloomberg.
[01:24:12.564 --> 01:24:15.706]  And I said, I see flu as their main attack coming up.
[01:24:16.673 --> 01:24:18.755]  And then that's when they announced pandemic end of the world.
[01:24:18.815 --> 01:24:19.635]  I said, this could be it.
[01:24:19.675 --> 01:24:24.058]  It could be a hoax or could be a cover story for something down the road for martial law.
[01:24:25.019 --> 01:24:26.560]  The troops are on the streets because of the flu.
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:29.142]  You know, five guys have died coming up in the fall.
[01:24:29.843 --> 01:24:31.524]  If one died, they acted like it was end of the world.
[01:24:31.544 --> 01:24:32.384]  What would happen if five died?
[01:24:32.825 --> 01:24:34.306]  Now they've got this fear thing going.
[01:24:35.907 --> 01:24:39.370]  One million have it, but it isn't hurting us.
[01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:40.811]  It's just a no big deal flu.
[01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:43.352]  See, this is mind control.
[01:24:44.341 --> 01:24:47.964]  And I wanted to read to you from CBS News.
[01:24:48.985 --> 01:24:49.325]  The U.S.
[01:24:49.345 --> 01:24:56.431]  Department of Homeland Security sent a memo to some health care providers noting procedures to following the swine flu outbreak eventually makes quarantines necessary.
[01:24:57.852 --> 01:25:05.779]  DHS Secretary Bridger McGraw circulated the swine flu memo which was obtained by CBS News.
[01:25:06.199 --> 01:25:09.222]  On Monday night it says the Department of Justice established legal federal authorities
[01:25:11.414 --> 01:25:17.842]  Pertaining to the implementation of a quarantine and enforcement under approval from HHS, the Surgeon General has the authority to issue quarantines.
[01:25:18.242 --> 01:25:21.466]  And it goes on to say forced inoculations and the executive order 13-375.
[01:25:21.486 --> 01:25:21.506]  13-375.
[01:25:30.233 --> 01:25:38.796]  And their argument is that you've got to take the shots because you'll make other people sick, but if the other idiots have taken it, then they can't get it.
[01:25:39.316 --> 01:25:41.377]  But this is in Arkansas.
[01:25:42.997 --> 01:25:47.659]  Arkansas State Health Department mandatory vaccines are constitutional, which of course they're not.
[01:25:48.513 --> 01:25:53.036]  And Paul goes through with the Supreme Court said blacks weren't humans and stuff like that in the past.
[01:25:53.056 --> 01:25:55.377]  There's a lot of other court rulings saying they can't make you take shots.
[01:25:55.717 --> 01:25:56.978]  There is no mandatory shot.
[01:25:57.278 --> 01:25:59.440]  It's recommended, but they do it through fraud.
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:04.343]  So here is the news website.
[01:26:04.503 --> 01:26:06.464]  A former Democrat is what it's called.
[01:26:06.664 --> 01:26:10.747]  They sent out vaccines contaminated with H5N1 avian flu.
[01:26:11.107 --> 01:26:16.210]  It's also in the article talking about Baxter Pharmaceutical involved in making the vaccine they're going to force you to take.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.261]  And this all happened the months before the outbreak.
[01:26:21.162 --> 01:26:23.803]  So here he is calling up a government official.
[01:26:24.024 --> 01:26:25.645]  We'll play it for this segment and part of the next.
[01:26:25.665 --> 01:26:26.085]  Here it is.
[01:26:29.667 --> 01:26:30.047]  Oh, hi.
[01:26:30.828 --> 01:26:32.809]  I was given your number by Alicia.
[01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:34.710]  I had some questions.
[01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:35.691]  I left you a message.
[01:26:35.711 --> 01:26:36.771]  I think I called Friday.
[01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:40.093]  I left you a message, but just that I'd call you back.
[01:26:41.474 --> 01:26:44.936]  I'm looking into the vaccination refusal forms.
[01:26:46.505 --> 01:26:55.932]  And I'm trying to find out what the... I talked to a lawyer and it seems that that is an application for a waiver.
[01:26:56.332 --> 01:26:57.193]  Is that correct?
[01:26:58.554 --> 01:26:59.635]  Do you know about these forms?
[01:27:00.535 --> 01:27:03.177]  Well, I don't know that it's an application for a waiver.
[01:27:03.217 --> 01:27:05.559]  The waiver will be granted if you just fill it out correctly.
[01:27:06.625 --> 01:27:08.607]  Okay, yeah, but it's basically... Hit pause.
[01:27:09.667 --> 01:27:10.047]  Hit pause.
[01:27:10.348 --> 01:27:12.909]  There is no law you've got to take vaccines.
[01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:17.092]  It becomes the policy of the state health department, lobbied by the feds.
[01:27:17.392 --> 01:27:21.575]  So when you heard Rick Perry said all girls got to take HPV shots, that's killing a bunch of them, admittedly.
[01:27:22.476 --> 01:27:24.097]  Just Google girls killed by Gardasil.
[01:27:26.178 --> 01:27:28.600]  He just made a list of recommended.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.441]  Then the school lies and says it's mandatory.
[01:27:32.302 --> 01:27:35.064]  Because, oh, we will grant you the waiver.
[01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.458]  If you fill out the form right.
[01:27:38.478 --> 01:27:39.259]  Because they have to.
[01:27:39.779 --> 01:27:43.041]  But that's to get a waiver for something there isn't a law for.
[01:27:43.361 --> 01:27:46.202]  This is all lawyer tricks, like 501c3 with churches.
[01:27:46.483 --> 01:27:47.903]  They didn't have to have that 50 years ago.
[01:27:48.424 --> 01:27:50.965]  But they got people tricked into signing and waiving their rights.
[01:27:51.665 --> 01:27:52.266]  Keep rolling it.
[01:27:53.926 --> 01:28:04.012]  To get it sent to me, and then the way it reads, if you read it, it says, I then fill it out, and then I send it in as a request for the waiver.
[01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:10.605]  And I'm not quite understanding what that is.
[01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:12.746]  You're saying it will always be.
[01:28:12.766 --> 01:28:18.910]  Well, if you've done it correctly, and if it's done, I'll give you a little history on that.
[01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:29.557]  Sure, if you've got time, I'd like to hear it, because I'm getting some feedback that... It's not like it's cumbersome, or it shouldn't be that difficult.
[01:28:30.717 --> 01:28:31.378]  What happened
[01:28:32.964 --> 01:28:53.296]  Prior to the passage of that law, which I believe went into effect in 2003, prior to that, the only exemptions that were available in Arkansas were a religious exemption that was very constrictive as far as who it applied to, and you could have a medical exemption.
[01:28:54.617 --> 01:28:58.139]  Are you talking for children?
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:28:59.140]  Yes.
[01:28:59.705 --> 01:29:02.046]  Okay, well, I'm talking for adults, too, here.
[01:29:02.086 --> 01:29:03.847]  I'm not just limited to children.
[01:29:04.087 --> 01:29:04.667]  It doesn't matter.
[01:29:04.707 --> 01:29:06.288]  I mean, it's for the science.
[01:29:06.308 --> 01:29:07.468]  Yeah, see, hit pause.
[01:29:07.488 --> 01:29:08.009]  It doesn't matter.
[01:29:08.029 --> 01:29:17.753]  According to this lawyer, and this is the legal counsel spokesman for the Arkansas State Health Department, all of us have to take whatever shots they say.
[01:29:17.853 --> 01:29:20.074]  See, there's no law.
[01:29:20.899 --> 01:29:25.923]  But then he claims and cites eugenics cases for racial hygiene coming up.
[01:29:26.203 --> 01:29:31.026]  These special family courts, that's the fraudulent new system of law.
[01:29:31.687 --> 01:29:34.689]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:35.610 --> 01:29:38.292]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:41.172 --> 01:29:46.734]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[01:29:47.034 --> 01:29:48.195]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:29:48.335 --> 01:29:52.316]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[01:29:52.616 --> 01:29:54.157]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:29:54.457 --> 01:30:00.760]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:04.461]  Inner food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:30:04.781 --> 01:30:06.261]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:30:06.521 --> 01:30:09.302]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:30:09.522 --> 01:30:10.962]  And their formula really works.
[01:30:11.242 --> 01:30:13.783]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:30:14.063 --> 01:30:15.303]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:19.885]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:30:20.305 --> 01:30:22.525]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:30:22.725 --> 01:30:24.986]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:26.946]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[01:30:41.316 --> 01:30:46.300]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:50.323]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:50.543 --> 01:30:56.128]  Number two, our new Energy Czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:56.428 --> 01:30:56.889]  It's true.
[01:30:57.069 --> 01:31:02.013]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:02.433 --> 01:31:07.858]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:31:08.719 --> 01:31:11.381]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:31:11.622 --> 01:31:15.825]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:16.146 --> 01:31:19.749]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:31:19.969 --> 01:31:25.476]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:31:25.716 --> 01:31:30.261]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:41.781 --> 01:31:46.063]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:31:46.283 --> 01:31:51.184]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:51.384 --> 01:31:52.725]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:31:52.905 --> 01:31:56.386]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:32:17.879 --> 01:32:19.201]  I use them and love them.
[01:32:19.221 --> 01:32:20.822]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:52.183]  Hey, side issue, San Antonio newspaper, The Current, great paper.
[01:32:52.203 --> 01:32:59.987]  You know, they've moved the new cybersecurity NSA snooping hub for the American people, one of the big ones, to a giant
[01:33:01.411 --> 01:33:05.214]  facility in San Antonio, and it's got barbed wire around it and all that.
[01:33:05.634 --> 01:33:11.858]  If you take a picture, the NSA will run out without warrants on city property outside, grab you, steal your stuff.
[01:33:12.178 --> 01:33:13.199]  I think I'm gonna go down there.
[01:33:13.739 --> 01:33:20.864]  Listen, you dirty crooks that work for offshore banks, we know you spy on every email, every fax, everything.
[01:33:21.145 --> 01:33:28.450]  You're engaging in crimes, you surveil us, you look through your walls, you're putting up your high-altitude blimps, you work for offshore banks,
[01:33:29.210 --> 01:33:37.792]  The National Reconnaissance Office, CIA, Defense Intelligence, your data mining, your total information awareness network, run by the criminal Admiral Poindexter.
[01:33:38.032 --> 01:33:40.552]  When Congress said shut it down, he legally kept it open.
[01:33:40.872 --> 01:33:42.532]  You make us sick!
[01:33:44.613 --> 01:33:51.654]  And the... Oh, it just makes my head spin.
[01:33:51.934 --> 01:33:54.014]  This government is so illegitimate and so criminal.
[01:33:54.074 --> 01:33:55.755]  Land of the free, home of the cowards, yeah.
[01:33:56.055 --> 01:33:57.495]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[01:33:58.459 --> 01:33:59.700]  Until we stand up and say no.
[01:34:00.081 --> 01:34:04.364]  This is a big data mining, giant facility to read all your emails and everything without warrants.
[01:34:05.225 --> 01:34:08.688]  And then they admit, NSA people admit, they sit around listening to you having phone sex with your wife.
[01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:12.192]  Or they dial in using the phone, even when it's on the receiver.
[01:34:12.392 --> 01:34:16.876]  They dial in and listen to you having sex, listen to you on the toilet, and they just sit around laughing all day.
[01:34:16.896 --> 01:34:17.737]  It's a bunch of criminals.
[01:34:18.916 --> 01:34:21.037]  Who then lie all these years saying they're not listening to you.
[01:34:21.297 --> 01:34:23.618]  And they're there to make sure America falls to the bankers.
[01:34:23.998 --> 01:34:34.962]  And they've had the cyber security run by the Air Force and the NSA say their job is to attack blogs and websites and go after bloggers that disagree with them and quote, kill American citizens if need be.
[01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:37.903]  One of their colonels is on record saying they're going to start killing us.
[01:34:38.996 --> 01:34:41.218]  So everybody needs to know where these criminals are at.
[01:34:41.598 --> 01:34:43.459]  And they will send the NSA out if you put this up.
[01:34:43.719 --> 01:34:50.424]  The panoptagon economy, the NSA's new data mining facility, is one component of a growing local surveillance industry.
[01:34:50.764 --> 01:34:52.646]  We should all go have a protest out there.
[01:34:53.763 --> 01:34:56.624]  And just sit there with these criminals and force the issue.
[01:34:57.364 --> 01:35:01.465]  Here they are illegally spying on us, engaging in all their crimes.
[01:35:01.725 --> 01:35:03.545]  I was down in San Antonio at gunpoint once.
[01:35:03.825 --> 01:35:06.706]  We were filming Delta Force at Fort Sam Houston.
[01:35:06.726 --> 01:35:07.826]  They just done a big drill there.
[01:35:08.626 --> 01:35:10.047]  They tried to rob the police chief.
[01:35:10.107 --> 01:35:10.827]  I went and interviewed him.
[01:35:10.847 --> 01:35:11.587]  They're total criminals.
[01:35:12.567 --> 01:35:16.668]  And MPs come up and put a gun to our chest, but we were on base.
[01:35:17.008 --> 01:35:18.248]  This won't be on base.
[01:35:18.608 --> 01:35:20.869]  You're a precious little crime center down there.
[01:35:22.628 --> 01:35:25.409]  Surrounded by barbed wire fencing on both sides.
[01:35:25.449 --> 01:35:26.169]  Don't get in or out.
[01:35:26.729 --> 01:35:33.572]  The anonymous yet massive building on West Military Drive near San Antonio's Loop 410 freeway looms mysteriously with no identifying signs of any kind.
[01:35:33.592 --> 01:35:34.392]  Surveillance is tight.
[01:35:35.893 --> 01:35:39.114]  The security cameras surround the under construction building.
[01:35:41.417 --> 01:35:51.291]  Readers are advised not to take photos unless you care to be detained for at least 45 minutes, interrogated by the National Security Agency and, as this reporter was, yeah, offshore criminals.
[01:35:52.292 --> 01:35:55.156]  In fact, go to the actual article, the Panopticon, let's put it up on screen.
[01:35:55.176 --> 01:35:57.880]  In fact, just Google that building, we'll give everybody a shot of that.
[01:35:59.977 --> 01:36:00.717]  And it's ridiculous.
[01:36:00.937 --> 01:36:01.798]  They know Google.
[01:36:01.818 --> 01:36:02.798]  They know satellites.
[01:36:02.818 --> 01:36:04.600]  They know anybody can get photos that are hidden.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.461]  It's about letting you know.
[01:36:06.741 --> 01:36:10.223]  Like the Washington Post reported, they've got a DARPA facility in D.C.
[01:36:10.483 --> 01:36:14.346]  Anybody out taking photos of their kids or dogs, you know, people got cameras.
[01:36:14.406 --> 01:36:18.668]  Oh, taking a picture of their buddy there at the bus stop.
[01:36:18.928 --> 01:36:20.769]  Cops run up, grab you, drag you off.
[01:36:21.050 --> 01:36:23.211]  It's about letting you know you're a slave.
[01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:26.073]  Letting you know you don't take photos in America.
[01:36:26.253 --> 01:36:27.514]  But they put up cameras.
[01:36:28.234 --> 01:36:38.181]  This facility also runs the face-scanning cameras on street corners, the heat resonance that know your heat signature, the cameras that scanner your license plates without warrants.
[01:36:38.201 --> 01:36:44.905]  They're also building a level 4 bio-weapons lab to create weapons to kill us down in San Antonio and to release into the vaccines.
[01:36:46.626 --> 01:36:49.708]  And they got a bunch of do-gooders, shaved-head morons working there.
[01:36:49.728 --> 01:36:51.389]  I have no idea how criminal this government is.
[01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.410]  There it is.
[01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:53.991]  The Panoptagon economy.
[01:36:54.451 --> 01:36:55.352]  San Antonio Current.
[01:36:55.592 --> 01:36:56.633]  They've done reports on us.
[01:36:57.931 --> 01:36:58.612]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:36:58.652 --> 01:37:00.313]  When I get some time, I'm going down there.
[01:37:02.694 --> 01:37:04.476]  NSA's going, oh look, he says he's coming down there.
[01:37:04.496 --> 01:37:06.897]  That means we can get NSA extra funding on him to run ops.
[01:37:07.198 --> 01:37:08.819]  Hey, I don't care what you criminals do to me.
[01:37:09.199 --> 01:37:09.779]  I'm good.
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:10.800]  I'm decent.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:13.662]  I'm not drug dealing child kidnappers like you.
[01:37:14.242 --> 01:37:18.545]  It's come out in congressional hearings that you run giant child kidnapping rings and help cover it up.
[01:37:18.785 --> 01:37:24.329]  The NSA is there to supply little kids for Arabs and foreigners to rape them and blow their heads off with 45s.
[01:37:26.308 --> 01:37:29.489]  Has been reported in the Italian news with the snuff films our government produces.
[01:37:29.890 --> 01:37:30.690]  That's what you are!
[01:37:30.930 --> 01:37:35.032]  A bunch of murdering criminals here to destroy America!
[01:37:35.252 --> 01:37:42.515]  You work for the illegitimate Federal Reserve that's announced it's above the law that's preparing to shoot the American people up with more cancer viruses.
[01:37:42.675 --> 01:37:48.698]  And you idiots will go shoot your families up with the cancer viruses and love the fact they flop around and die later because you're cowards!
[01:37:49.298 --> 01:37:54.182]  You're all good patriots, real conservative, all this gun-grabbing going on.
[01:37:54.362 --> 01:37:57.084]  You're a bunch of felons with Admiral Poindexter!
[01:37:57.104 --> 01:37:59.846]  I just can't handle it.
[01:38:00.647 --> 01:38:12.996]  In America, red, white, and blue, you go down in a major giant FEMA camp complex, that's really what it is, with a bunch of goons setting up their big data spying, data mining, criminal operation, and they come out
[01:38:14.178 --> 01:38:16.559]  Like you couldn't drive by with cars and video cameras all day.
[01:38:16.739 --> 01:38:18.080]  Like people don't know where it is.
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:19.640]  Like it hadn't been on the news.
[01:38:19.881 --> 01:38:21.761]  Like real terrorists exist!
[01:38:22.282 --> 01:38:24.643]  The NSA had all the intercepts on 9-11.
[01:38:24.803 --> 01:38:26.644]  Your bosses staged the attacks!
[01:38:27.064 --> 01:38:28.584]  Don't use the stinking terrorists!
[01:38:28.604 --> 01:38:34.627]  See, you used to stage your stinking terror attacks in third world countries to go in and, eh, we're just overthrowing these dumb brown people.
[01:38:34.807 --> 01:38:35.688]  Heh heh heh heh!
[01:38:35.888 --> 01:38:37.168]  But now you're doing it here, aren't you?
[01:38:37.208 --> 01:38:37.909]  To the Republic.
[01:38:39.429 --> 01:38:40.430]  I mean, where does it end?
[01:38:41.290 --> 01:38:42.811]  Did you find the Washington Post article?
[01:38:44.347 --> 01:38:45.448]  Punch that up on screen for folks.
[01:38:45.488 --> 01:38:46.929]  Show them the facility.
[01:38:48.170 --> 01:38:50.511]  All you got to Google is... It was all over the news last week.
[01:38:50.551 --> 01:38:51.172]  I didn't cover it.
[01:38:51.192 --> 01:38:51.572]  I should have.
[01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:52.372]  I want to get the guy on it.
[01:38:52.412 --> 01:38:52.773]  Happened to.
[01:38:53.033 --> 01:38:53.873]  I told the producers.
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:00.621]  Takes a photo of this big giant apartment building complex in D.C.
[01:39:00.641 --> 01:39:01.662]  and they run out and grab him.
[01:39:02.442 --> 01:39:03.522]  And he's suing them, by the way, now.
[01:39:03.542 --> 01:39:05.463]  And it turns out there's no law.
[01:39:05.923 --> 01:39:07.904]  It's just made up national security.
[01:39:08.544 --> 01:39:10.825]  They'd love to grab you and rip your teeth out with pliers.
[01:39:10.845 --> 01:39:11.525]  That's what they are.
[01:39:11.745 --> 01:39:15.546]  The pedophile criminal murderers join the government so they can do this.
[01:39:15.586 --> 01:39:16.386]  They hate you.
[01:39:16.687 --> 01:39:17.847]  It has nothing to do with security.
[01:39:18.027 --> 01:39:24.109]  It's about letting you know you're nobody but somebody to work for them until you're 50 and then die of cancer they injected you with.
[01:39:25.994 --> 01:39:28.797]  It's like, man detained for taking a photo of a building.
[01:39:30.498 --> 01:39:31.259]  Washington Post.
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:34.141]  That was last week, I see it every day.
[01:39:34.781 --> 01:39:37.744]  And I've had it happen to me in England, they've been putting their terror databases.
[01:39:37.944 --> 01:39:42.067]  Because they are terrorist criminals, robbing and stealing everything.
[01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:45.510]  Coming up, I'm going to finish the clip.
[01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:51.996]  They're about to pass bills to regulate and tax and do home inspections and tax all carbon.
[01:39:53.737 --> 01:39:54.618]  It's been all over the news.
[01:39:58.234 --> 01:39:59.276]  It's Washington Post.
[01:40:00.419 --> 01:40:01.080]  Man detained.
[01:40:02.944 --> 01:40:03.826]  Oh, now I'm going crazy.
[01:40:03.846 --> 01:40:05.069]  Let me think of the exact headline.
[01:40:06.552 --> 01:40:07.434]  Exact headline.
[01:40:13.955 --> 01:40:17.356]  It is now illegal to take photos of buildings in D.C.
[01:40:17.576 --> 01:40:18.356]  But there's no law!
[01:40:18.556 --> 01:40:19.596]  But they have weapons!
[01:40:20.037 --> 01:40:24.517]  And it's their country and they're going to ship the coke and heroin in and your kids are going to use it and go to their own prisons.
[01:40:24.698 --> 01:40:26.658]  And they're going to make your kids take Ritalin and Prozac.
[01:40:26.838 --> 01:40:28.598]  And they're going to take your guns and they're going to hurt you.
[01:40:28.638 --> 01:40:34.039]  And they've got a lot of stupid goons who like to push people around and aren't real warriors that like to pick on innocent people.
[01:40:34.239 --> 01:40:36.540]  And they enjoy just destroying the Republic.
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:38.400]  Just fill... Yes, there it is.
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:38.700]  There it is.
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:39.321]  Washington Post.
[01:40:39.641 --> 01:40:41.241]  Secret buildings you may not photograph.
[01:40:42.657 --> 01:40:44.278]  There's the Washington Post right there.
[01:40:44.998 --> 01:40:46.759]  Secret buildings you may not photograph.
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:48.500]  DARPA.
[01:40:50.781 --> 01:41:02.408]  I am sick of you criminal filth trying to domesticate us and intimidate us and set the precedent that we're your slaves so your offshore banker masters can suck us dry!
[01:41:02.808 --> 01:41:04.329]  Stop being traitors!
[01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:06.570]  Stop destroying the United States!
[01:41:06.930 --> 01:41:08.571]  Stop claiming you're patriots!
[01:41:15.768 --> 01:41:23.657]  I just see stuff like this and it makes me mad and I'm already wound up over the Federal Reserve dictatorship and saying Congress has no authority over the coining and issuance of currency and money.
[01:41:26.508 --> 01:41:29.769]  I go to events and they have the Army watching us, and it's now in the news.
[01:41:30.009 --> 01:41:33.430]  The Army follows us around when we go protest the Federal Reserve in Ron Paul.
[01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:34.771]  You're criminals!
[01:41:35.111 --> 01:41:36.111]  You're in the wrong!
[01:41:36.391 --> 01:41:37.251]  You're bad!
[01:41:37.512 --> 01:41:38.032]  Got it?
[01:41:38.472 --> 01:41:39.452]  Get it through your head!
[01:41:39.472 --> 01:41:47.095]  But see, they hire these little nobody scumbags, and people used to torturing people and spying on people in Iraq, and they're bringing them all back here to do it to us.
[01:41:47.415 --> 01:41:48.215]  You are trash.
[01:41:48.255 --> 01:41:48.975]  You are scum.
[01:41:49.155 --> 01:41:50.116]  You're worse than Stalin.
[01:41:50.136 --> 01:41:51.236]  You're as bad as Hitler.
[01:41:51.516 --> 01:41:52.536]  You're as bad as linen.
[01:41:52.717 --> 01:41:53.417]  You're trash.
[01:41:53.437 --> 01:41:53.997]  You're filth.
[01:41:54.197 --> 01:41:55.338]  You're malice crap.
[01:41:55.558 --> 01:41:57.238]  You're pieces of un-American trash.
[01:41:57.478 --> 01:41:59.099]  Get the American flags off your car.
[01:41:59.359 --> 01:42:02.861]  Stop putting Browning stickers, deer-hunting stickers on your car.
[01:42:03.101 --> 01:42:05.322]  Swaggin' around, you're an American-er.
[01:42:05.542 --> 01:42:06.702]  I know who you people are.
[01:42:06.882 --> 01:42:09.183]  You're a bunch of trash on power trips!
[01:42:09.764 --> 01:42:12.925]  And I swear we're gonna bring you to justice when we take this country back.
[01:42:13.125 --> 01:42:15.446]  We gotta make sure you all get in trouble for what you've done.
[01:42:15.466 --> 01:42:17.667]  Because you'll just come right back like cancer!
[01:42:22.759 --> 01:42:26.788]  God, they go on ABC News and brag how they listen to you have sex with your wife and sit around laughing.
[01:42:27.009 --> 01:42:29.795]  The NSA guys literally just sit there in their offices masturbating.
[01:42:30.728 --> 01:42:34.831]  I mean, that's just a bunch of scumbags masturbating, is what the NSA is.
[01:42:35.552 --> 01:42:41.417]  And covering up, local cops are about to bust a government child kidnapping ring, NSA comes in to stop.
[01:42:41.957 --> 01:42:46.481]  Somebody catches government shipping drugs in, NSA finds out, comes in and blocks the investigation.
[01:42:46.722 --> 01:42:48.643]  It's all to make sure their crimes continue.
[01:42:48.883 --> 01:42:55.369]  And spying on Congress illegally, and running all their scams, and MI6 and MI5, spies on the British Parliament.
[01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:57.270]  You're criminals, we're gonna get you.
[01:42:57.571 --> 01:42:57.971]  You're criminals!
[01:42:59.312 --> 01:43:04.275]  And a lot of you are just compartmentalizing, just grab the data and pass it up to the sicko eggheads above you.
[01:43:06.256 --> 01:43:08.398]  Okay, now I'm getting mad.
[01:43:08.418 --> 01:43:14.741]  Go ahead and finish the clip where this bastard creature in Arkansas is saying it's the law, we're going to forcibly inject you.
[01:43:14.781 --> 01:43:15.202]  Here it is.
[01:43:15.782 --> 01:43:18.724]  Oh, I can refuse a vaccination whenever I want.
[01:43:18.984 --> 01:43:22.606]  I mean, Sam, are you going into college or is this why you're asking?
[01:43:23.166 --> 01:43:27.209]  No, I'm concerned about mandatory vaccinations for this point.
[01:43:29.437 --> 01:43:31.898]  Well, there is no mandatory vaccination for the swine flu.
[01:43:31.978 --> 01:43:35.260]  Well, if you read the CDC, you'd read that differently, I'm afraid.
[01:43:36.281 --> 01:43:38.822]  Well, I'm not saying there couldn't be in the future, but... Well, exactly.
[01:43:38.842 --> 01:43:39.462]  That's my point.
[01:43:39.723 --> 01:43:44.645]  There's certainly nothing... Well, it's... And that's very... I mean, that's constitutional.
[01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:45.506]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:51.129]  Well, there are a lot of things that are constitutional that are being undone right now, so that is why I'm questioning it.
[01:43:51.149 --> 01:43:57.012]  I mean, this is a law that goes back, you know, a hundred years, maybe more.
[01:43:58.629 --> 01:44:02.791]  Yeah, there were laws to take black babies and put them in buckets of water.
[01:44:03.692 --> 01:44:04.933]  Saying they weren't human and kill them.
[01:44:04.953 --> 01:44:05.533]  Is that good?
[01:44:07.515 --> 01:44:08.695]  Sick all you cowards.
[01:44:09.236 --> 01:44:10.296]  You know this is tyranny.
[01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:13.859]  But you're going to roll over and go along with it until this country turns into a total cesspit.
[01:44:14.119 --> 01:44:14.960]  Because that's what you like.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:19.342]  Because they're not artists, they're not creators, they're not business owners, they're parasites.
[01:44:19.723 --> 01:44:22.224]  It's a world run of scum like you.
[01:44:23.145 --> 01:44:23.966]  Keep playing the filth.
[01:44:28.246 --> 01:44:30.388]  They've gone to the Supreme Court.
[01:44:30.988 --> 01:44:31.929]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:44:32.289 --> 01:44:35.291]  That you're saying their vaccinations can be made mandatory?
[01:44:35.871 --> 01:44:36.372]  Absolutely.
[01:44:37.152 --> 01:44:37.533]  Absolutely.
[01:44:37.553 --> 01:44:38.473]  Let me stop right there.
[01:44:38.533 --> 01:44:42.436]  See, we have the dummy public thinking I make it up when I give you the executive order.
[01:44:42.636 --> 01:44:53.784]  Let me give you the executive order for forced quarantine inoculations, and for five years they've been secretly hiring tens of thousands of preachers to tell their flocks to go to FEMA camps, take forced injections, and turn the guns in.
[01:44:53.844 --> 01:44:54.504]  It's of God.
[01:44:54.825 --> 01:44:56.466]  That means they're getting ready to try it.
[01:44:57.551 --> 01:44:58.314]  What'd you guys just say?
[01:45:00.622 --> 01:45:01.024]  Oh, thank you.
[01:45:01.044 --> 01:45:02.188]  They're popping my ear up at the network.
[01:45:04.025 --> 01:45:06.906]  DHS sets guidelines for possible swine flu.
[01:45:06.946 --> 01:45:07.806]  CBS News.
[01:45:08.126 --> 01:45:08.746]  Quarantines.
[01:45:09.246 --> 01:45:10.206]  Forced inoculations.
[01:45:10.606 --> 01:45:11.326]  Executive Order 13-375.
[01:45:11.346 --> 01:45:11.846]  13-375!
[01:45:11.926 --> 01:45:16.827]  Here, I'll circle it.
[01:45:17.127 --> 01:45:17.827]  Right there for you.
[01:45:18.027 --> 01:45:19.088]  Zoom in on that for them.
[01:45:19.228 --> 01:45:24.629]  They're out there in denial, sucking their thumbs and drinking sodium death fluoride because they love being euthanized.
[01:45:25.169 --> 01:45:27.089]  Why shouldn't the elite steal everything and just take over?
[01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:28.409]  You love drinking their poison water.
[01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:29.770]  Hell, it's a big joke.
[01:45:30.150 --> 01:45:31.150]  I bet the guys at the NSA
[01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:33.591]  Drink extra fluoride water!
[01:45:33.751 --> 01:45:35.012]  I bet they give it to their babies!
[01:45:35.712 --> 01:45:40.435]  Because it's all about being slaves and being stupid and being conned and being gamed and being run over.
[01:45:40.616 --> 01:45:44.478]  Finish the clip.
[01:45:45.859 --> 01:45:57.166]  I'm looking into the vaccination refusal forms and I'm trying to find out what the... I talked to a lawyer and it seems that
[01:45:58.337 --> 01:46:00.118]  That is an application for a weapon.
[01:46:00.138 --> 01:46:01.239]  You guys just started the clip over.
[01:46:01.259 --> 01:46:01.719]  Forget it.
[01:46:02.299 --> 01:46:02.719]  Forget it.
[01:46:02.759 --> 01:46:04.980]  The whole clip's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:46:05.601 --> 01:46:10.163]  Just stop being in denial about what... And then the company that's made the vaccine is Baxter.
[01:46:10.423 --> 01:46:13.385]  Caught putting weaponized bird flu in the vaccines.
[01:46:13.565 --> 01:46:14.485]  Bloomberg News.
[01:46:14.765 --> 01:46:15.626]  But you don't care.
[01:46:16.286 --> 01:46:42.137]  And people will take it, and they'll die, and you'll stick your kids to the ground, and you'll go, proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm thumb scanned, and everything gets listened to, and the police wear black uniforms, and I get home inspections for my carbon tax, and I gladly turn my guns in, cause I'm proud to be a slave of the bankers!
[01:46:42.497 --> 01:46:44.798]  God bless the slaves!
[01:46:45.698 --> 01:46:46.619]  And the masters!
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:52.922]  The idiot type redneck people, they've got to serve the new order kind of as the enforcer.
[01:46:54.383 --> 01:46:55.703]  It's like gorillas, like policy.
[01:46:56.444 --> 01:47:01.406]  I mean, you know, I'm kind of ashamed I'm a little bit related to them.
[01:47:01.807 --> 01:47:03.408]  They got a bunch of other scum working for them.
[01:47:03.448 --> 01:47:03.888]  I've seen you.
[01:47:03.908 --> 01:47:04.808]  You're a bunch of trash.
[01:47:05.409 --> 01:47:06.169]  Oh, I hate you.
[01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:10.471]  Liberty folks, I'm really threatened by all this.
[01:47:10.491 --> 01:47:11.452]  I get a little fired up.
[01:47:12.901 --> 01:47:15.262]  But the spirit of liberty is infectious, is it not?
[01:47:15.943 --> 01:47:20.065]  Alright, let's go ahead and take more... take calls from Ted Anderson.
[01:47:20.085 --> 01:47:22.667]  Folks, I can't handle it anymore.
[01:47:22.727 --> 01:47:25.629]  I'm starting to... I'm starting to really have a problem here.
[01:47:26.429 --> 01:47:32.413]  I mean, it's just... I realize what scum the government is, how it's filled with... What's funny, guys?
[01:47:32.433 --> 01:47:35.134]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:47:35.715 --> 01:47:37.036]  Alright, let's go to Ted Anderson.
[01:47:37.396 --> 01:47:38.356]  They're in there laughing at me.
[01:47:38.376 --> 01:47:39.057]  This ain't funny.
[01:47:43.628 --> 01:47:45.629]  I just blew my voice out earlier screaming.
[01:47:46.049 --> 01:47:47.430]  People ask why my voice is so deep.
[01:47:48.211 --> 01:47:50.912]  I go out and bullhorn the NSA like I'm going to probably go do.
[01:47:52.113 --> 01:47:56.515]  And there'll be army guys in plainclothes in the Air Force acting like they're friends.
[01:47:56.735 --> 01:47:58.716]  They'll be acting real scared though when you're by.
[01:47:58.736 --> 01:48:01.018]  They'll be going, Hi Alex, I'm here for the protest.
[01:48:01.038 --> 01:48:03.199]  And they actually are scared.
[01:48:03.219 --> 01:48:06.401]  Oh God, it's them Patriot people that wear George Washington shirts.
[01:48:06.441 --> 01:48:08.162]  Oh God, it's so scary.
[01:48:08.182 --> 01:48:08.942]  They might get me.
[01:48:11.301 --> 01:48:14.785]  We're good to go.
[01:48:32.603 --> 01:48:33.764]  You bought it and it was a lot lower.
[01:48:34.004 --> 01:48:35.285]  You're passing those savings on.
[01:48:35.545 --> 01:48:36.626]  People shouldn't listen to me, though.
[01:48:36.646 --> 01:48:43.652]  They should probably just keep their paper money, stay in the stock market, trust the government, don't get into gold and silver that's tripled in value the last few years.
[01:48:43.812 --> 01:48:44.713]  Just don't do it, right, Ted?
[01:48:45.333 --> 01:48:46.794]  Well, you know, here's what I have to say.
[01:48:47.195 --> 01:48:57.663]  If they pass this cap-and-trade bill, and right now it's about a 50-50 shot, that is going to be the death to the United States currency because that is what's needed in order to have a world bank.
[01:48:58.682 --> 01:49:02.323]  Hey, that's what the NSA's there to make sure the raping goes well.
[01:49:02.343 --> 01:49:05.644]  The Pentagon is a knife slitting our throat.
[01:49:05.944 --> 01:49:06.725]  TRAITORS!
[01:49:07.305 --> 01:49:09.265]  Well, that's exactly what I'm trying to say.
[01:49:09.285 --> 01:49:17.548]  The Federal Reserve Act was passed in 1913, Alex, and then the taxes, the federal income taxes passed the same year.
[01:49:17.848 --> 01:49:20.269]  You cannot have a central bank in the world
[01:49:21.451 --> 01:49:24.512]  We're doing what America needs, Ted!
[01:49:24.712 --> 01:49:29.715]  The NSA needs to make sure Northcom stops the people from foreign banks ruling, Ted!
[01:49:31.235 --> 01:49:34.497]  Anyways, that's just the point that I'm trying to come up with, Alex.
[01:49:34.537 --> 01:49:39.499]  I mean, we are sitting... I mean, we lose this one battle today, it's done.
[01:49:39.579 --> 01:49:40.259]  We're screwed.
[01:49:40.299 --> 01:49:41.320]  This nation is...
[01:49:42.097 --> 01:49:42.878]  Is toast.
[01:49:43.578 --> 01:49:44.839]  No, that's what the NSA wants.
[01:49:44.899 --> 01:49:47.741]  Traitorous pieces of trash that openly admit they work for offshore corporations.
[01:49:48.142 --> 01:49:49.563]  Oh, you didn't know you're Thomas Barnett?
[01:49:49.603 --> 01:49:50.944]  It's on C-SPAN and brags about it.
[01:49:51.304 --> 01:49:51.884]  Stay there, chow.
[01:49:51.904 --> 01:49:53.085]  Tell them about the coins when we get back.
[01:49:53.466 --> 01:49:54.606]  You know, we're not done.
[01:49:55.027 --> 01:49:59.330]  It just means that these bastards are going for broke, but I agree, it's really bad.
[01:49:59.670 --> 01:50:05.615]  And then the slaves want to see what it's like going under a socialist grid with Obamanoid Nazis running around in red and black uniforms.
[01:50:06.431 --> 01:50:07.231]  Ted, can you believe it?
[01:50:07.672 --> 01:50:12.194]  NSA spy bases everywhere, FEMA camps, Obama Brigades marching around.
[01:50:12.214 --> 01:50:14.415]  I mean, it's just insane, Ted.
[01:50:14.435 --> 01:50:18.116]  It sounds more like Nazi Germany than it does the United States of America.
[01:50:18.236 --> 01:50:20.878]  Yeah, well their Nazi Germany can just go to hell, Ted.
[01:50:20.938 --> 01:50:22.478]  I mean, I'm just really getting sick of it.
[01:50:22.879 --> 01:50:25.100]  And all you stupid good old boys that work for the system.
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:28.201]  Man, what is wrong with you, you cops and the rest of you?
[01:50:28.421 --> 01:50:29.642]  This is classical tyranny.
[01:50:30.586 --> 01:50:34.375]  I know, you're going to sit out and think you're going to be safe because you're born cowards and trash.
[01:50:34.716 --> 01:50:35.418]  Well, not me!
[01:50:35.879 --> 01:50:36.420]  Not me!
[01:50:36.901 --> 01:50:37.543]  Not me!
[01:50:37.563 --> 01:50:40.710]  I won't urinate all over my forebears.
