[00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.503]  The footage you're about to see should make the stomach churn.
[00:00:05.103 --> 00:00:06.745]  Should make you nauseous if you love freedom.
[00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:14.772]  You know, people in third world countries, Soviet Russia, Communist China, get treated like slaves by police and private security guards.
[00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:18.215]  They get told you're not allowed to film, you're not allowed to shoot video, government buildings.
[00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:21.546]  And now that's coming to the United States and England.
[00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:26.709]  In fact, in England they passed a law saying it's an act of terrorism to film the police, even if they're beating somebody up.
[00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.069]  This is tyranny.
[00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:34.052]  The government puts their cameras everywhere, videotaping us, controlling our lives, but then we're bad if we videotape them.
[00:00:34.953 --> 00:00:39.355]  Now, I've seen footage on the internet of news reporters out front the
[00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:41.889]  Washington D.C.
[00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.832]  Private Fellow Reserve on the sidewalk, not on their property, and they come over and say, it's the law, turn your cameras off.
[00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:49.913]  Well, that happened in Kansas City.
[00:00:50.333 --> 00:01:04.520]  Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson were in Kansas City to interview a former federal regulator, Mr. Black, Professor Black, about the scams that are going on with the $12.8 trillion stolen by the Private Fellow Reserve this weekend.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.421]  And on their way back to their hotel, they saw
[00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:11.644]  The regional Federal Reserve building and said, oh there's the Federal Reserve.
[00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:15.568]  Let's pull up over there and let's shoot some video.
[00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:26.898]  So they're at a park about 150 yards away from the Federal Reserve videotaping it and the same private Federal Security Guards in little Nazi outfits with the black belts come over and say, what's your names or we'll arrest you.
[00:01:27.258 --> 00:01:28.039]  No more Fifth Amendment.
[00:01:29.284 --> 00:01:30.905]  No law cited, they're not even cops.
[00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:32.545]  They don't even work for a federal agency.
[00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:38.088]  And then they say, now leave or we're going to arrest you, and you have to leave this park.
[00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:43.110]  We don't own it, but the Federal Reserve across the street is concerned about you, so we say get off this park as well.
[00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.371]  This is what it is to be a slave.
[00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:47.151]  This is what it is to be a thug.
[00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.660]  On their side.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.802]  This is what it is for the people to be slaves.
[00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:55.167]  This is what it is for the system to live under this thuggish system.
[00:01:56.188 --> 00:01:57.890]  And I'm just sick of it and I'm tired of it.
[00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.815]  In 38 locations across the country last year, we covered the Obama deception.
[00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:06.841]  People went out and protested the private Federal Reserve that took over in 1913 and gave us the private income tax.
[00:02:09.448 --> 00:02:14.349]  We later got documents, the news confirmed, regular army intelligence was there spying on us.
[00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.131]  And we also got the MIAC report with similar things, saying the in the Fed people are terrorists.
[00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:29.353]  No, we're American citizens, we have a right to protest you, a right to videotape you, a right to show people the private Federal Reserve that has stolen as much money as the U.S.
[00:02:29.413 --> 00:02:30.714]  GDP has in a year.
[00:02:31.314 --> 00:02:32.514]  GDP is 13 trillion.
[00:02:32.814 --> 00:02:35.095]  In six months, they've stolen 12.8 trillion.
[00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:37.916]  So, they're on line to be double the GDP in a year.
[00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:39.796]  Right now, they're right at the GDP.
[00:02:40.537 --> 00:02:49.359]  So, it's my right, First Amendment, Freedom in America, to talk about you people, and it's my right to show footage of what you're doing and what the private Federal Reserve is.
[00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:53.000]  You people are out of your minds, thugs, and you think we're your slaves.
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.182]  You've stolen so much money from us, you've bossed us around long enough, and you think we exist here to be sucked off of by you.
[00:03:00.962 --> 00:03:03.343]  The enemy of freedom is the Federal Reserve and the bankers.
[00:03:03.703 --> 00:03:07.724]  Now watch this film and spread the word that this is the criminals that run our country.
[00:03:27.037 --> 00:03:27.357]  I'm sorry?
[00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:30.018]  We were just seeing who you were and what you were doing.
[00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:31.738]  Uh, what's your name?
[00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:32.438]  Uh, my name's Aaron.
[00:03:32.658 --> 00:03:32.878]  Okay.
[00:03:33.718 --> 00:03:35.439]  Hey, Aaron, you're fine.
[00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:36.879]  We're just checking out this memorial, so.
[00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.019]  You're not doing anything wrong, okay?
[00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:39.939]  What's your last name, sir?
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.000]  I'm not going to give you my last name.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.941]  If you're not going to cooperate, I'm just asking questions.
[00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:49.241]  This is public property.
[00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.022]  No, it's not, actually.
[00:03:58.726 --> 00:04:06.912]  Okay, but first of all, whose property is this?
[00:04:08.032 --> 00:04:08.313]  Okay.
[00:04:09.814 --> 00:04:12.455]  And you're police officers or security officers?
[00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:21.041]  That's right.
[00:04:22.502 --> 00:04:22.742]  Yeah.
[00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:25.304]  Well, that's all we're here to videotape.
[00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:25.644]  Okay.
[00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.013]  Thank you.
[00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:41.438]  Come on guys, let's go.
[00:04:41.878 --> 00:04:43.659]  Now why do I have to leave?
[00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:45.840]  Because you're with him.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.322]  Where's the property at?
[00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:48.782]  Old Park.
[00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:51.492]  Well, if he gave his name, then he doesn't have to leave.
[00:04:51.572 --> 00:04:54.394]  He did give his name, but it's kind of guilt by association.
[00:04:54.454 --> 00:04:55.615]  You guys need to go ahead and go.
[00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:56.916]  What is guilt by association?
[00:04:56.976 --> 00:04:58.256]  Sir, we're not going to answer any more questions.
[00:04:58.276 --> 00:04:59.417]  You can go to jail or you can leave.
[00:04:59.717 --> 00:05:00.778]  Are you a police officer, sir?
[00:05:01.378 --> 00:05:02.399]  We do have arrest powers.
[00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.179]  Do you want to go to jail?
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.860]  Am I under arrest?
[00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:06.241]  No, you're not under arrest.
[00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:06.642]  Not yet.
[00:05:06.722 --> 00:05:07.302]  You need to leave.
[00:05:07.362 --> 00:05:09.043]  You're encroaching on our First Amendment right.
[00:05:09.063 --> 00:05:09.804]  No, we are not.
[00:05:10.084 --> 00:05:10.444]  Why not?
[00:05:10.464 --> 00:05:12.105]  This is public property.
[00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:13.546]  We have a right.
[00:05:13.586 --> 00:05:14.126]  Go ahead and go.
[00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:15.087]  Now.
[00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:19.974]  This is the death of America you're witnessing on this tape, and it needs to stop.
[00:05:20.775 --> 00:05:30.904]  And the little thugs that work at the Federal Reserve all over the country need to know that it's illegal what they're doing, it's a violation of civil rights, and people need to take legal action against them.
[00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:38.871]  And everybody needs to go out every day and videotape the private Federal Reserve and let those thugs know it's your right to videotape that federal building.
[00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:40.973]  If I'd have been there, I'd have let them arrest me.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.781]  The problem is they would have probably tried to set us up.
[00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.261]  You gotta know they're dangerous.
[00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:49.722]  We had New York police with VR chains say their video camera was a gun and their backpack was a bomb.
[00:05:50.042 --> 00:05:52.443]  And they said, we know you're not really terrorists, but we're gonna say you are.
[00:05:52.823 --> 00:05:55.444]  This whole war on terror is about making us slaves.
[00:05:55.644 --> 00:06:03.606]  Where they put cameras in school bathrooms and cameras on the street corners reading our license plates, but we can't go sit on a sidewalk and videotape our private owners.
[00:06:07.947 --> 00:06:08.267]  What's that?
[00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.011]  I'm getting some security shots.
[00:06:13.031 --> 00:06:15.833]  No, you need to go through Public Affairs for you to videotape or take pictures.
[00:06:16.213 --> 00:06:16.973]  Of any federal building?
[00:06:17.153 --> 00:06:17.934]  Of any federal building.
[00:06:17.954 --> 00:06:21.356]  Because I always think that the Cabinet of Science is... I don't care.
[00:06:21.376 --> 00:06:21.916]  Cabinet of Science.
[00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:23.397]  It's got to be served.
[00:06:24.118 --> 00:06:27.840]  When you take pictures or videotape, you just have to call Public Affairs.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.841]  They set it up.
[00:06:28.861 --> 00:06:29.561]  You have a meeting.
[00:06:30.282 --> 00:06:31.742]  They tell you what time to come out and take pictures.
[00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:32.863]  You can take pictures all day long.
[00:06:32.883 --> 00:06:35.205]  So I can't stand on the public sidewalk and take pictures?
[00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:39.047]  You can go across the street if you like, but they're still going to come over there and ask you questions if you stay too long.
[00:06:41.195 --> 00:06:43.136]  So where am I allowed to shoot from?
[00:06:43.256 --> 00:06:45.297]  Really, you can't take pictures of a federal building.
[00:06:45.877 --> 00:06:46.297]  Period.
[00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:47.998]  But not even the capitol?
[00:06:48.018 --> 00:06:49.939]  If I was a tourist, I couldn't even take a picture of the capitol?
[00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:53.620]  If you was a tourist and you went by and you snapped a picture, they're not going to snatch your camera.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.502]  But if you come up with something like that, they're going to approach you and they're going to ask you what you're doing, they're going to ask you for ID, all that good stuff.
[00:07:00.643 --> 00:07:00.763]  Huh.
[00:07:00.843 --> 00:07:01.543]  Okay?
[00:07:01.663 --> 00:07:03.044]  What if I was wearing like a press badge?
[00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:08.366]  Now, if you did that, they're going to ask you who's your contact person, because then you should have contacted public affairs.
[00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:11.014]  Um, the Fed Public Affairs?
[00:07:11.174 --> 00:07:12.535]  Public Affairs for the Federal Reserve.
[00:07:13.256 --> 00:07:16.037]  So, for every building I need to contact that public affairs person?
[00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:16.398]  Yes, sir.
[00:07:16.418 --> 00:07:18.399]  Even if it's just to shoot from the public sidewalk?
[00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:18.779]  Yes, sir.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.420]  I did not know that.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:20.940]  Yes, sir.
[00:07:21.701 --> 00:07:22.221]  Is that new?
[00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:23.742]  No, it's always been like that.
[00:07:23.762 --> 00:07:27.524]  Now, there's tourists that come through here, snap a picture, and keep on going.
[00:07:27.544 --> 00:07:28.765]  Yeah, and need to be on file?
[00:07:28.845 --> 00:07:31.027]  No, as long as they take a picture and keep on going.
[00:07:31.327 --> 00:07:34.649]  But when you come up with a video camera like that, that's when we come out and get you.
[00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:38.705]  Because I've shot like tons of billions and you're the first person to ever approach me.
[00:07:38.885 --> 00:07:40.327]  They probably never paid attention to you.
[00:07:41.208 --> 00:07:42.550]  But this is the Federal Reserve.
[00:07:44.072 --> 00:07:44.392]  Okay?
[00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:45.333]  Is that bigger?
[00:07:46.494 --> 00:07:47.754]  What do you mean?
[00:07:47.774 --> 00:07:50.415]  You don't know what the Federal Reserve is?
[00:07:50.435 --> 00:07:51.655]  Okay, who do you work for?
[00:07:52.015 --> 00:07:53.036]  The American News Project.
[00:07:53.076 --> 00:07:56.357]  What I mean is I've shot the White House and the Capitol Building.
[00:07:56.437 --> 00:07:57.337]  And they never approached you?
[00:07:57.357 --> 00:07:57.437]  No.
[00:07:57.457 --> 00:07:59.597]  I can't even see that being possible.
[00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:00.318]  Or the Treasury Building.
[00:08:00.358 --> 00:08:02.578]  You know, standing there where all the public walks?
[00:08:02.618 --> 00:08:03.819]  They're standing right there on the sidewalk.
[00:08:03.859 --> 00:08:04.299]  Taking pictures.
[00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:06.239]  You know, just getting some B-roll digs there.
[00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:12.421]  I've never had anybody... But no, in order for you to take pictures of this building or any kind of videotape, you have to go to Public Affairs.
[00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.520]  Do you work, are you Reserve Fed Security or are you DC Police?
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.204]  Federal Reserve Police.
[00:08:19.605 --> 00:08:20.608]  Federal Reserve Police?
[00:08:20.648 --> 00:08:20.788]  Yeah.
[00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:21.911]  Okay, thanks.
