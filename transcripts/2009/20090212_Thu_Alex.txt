[00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:12.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:25.092]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv, about to go to Mark Dice on the ResistanceManifesto.com, but finishing up
[00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:28.879]  With Daniel in Virginia, you had one other point you wanted to make.
[00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:29.620]  Daniel, go ahead.
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.700]  Yes, sir.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.542]  I just wanted to say that this is not a two-party system.
[00:00:36.143 --> 00:00:41.205]  This is a two-political, wings-of-desolation system.
[00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:47.608]  And what I mean by that is, I read the Bible a lot, and I read the book of Daniel.
[00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:54.951]  And the book of Daniel mentions about the desolation, the wings of desolation, and it's in chapter 9 of Daniel.
[00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:57.236]  And it tells about the desolation.
[00:00:58.317 --> 00:01:06.384]  And we are living in the times that we are under a two-wing political desolation system.
[00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:13.989]  And all they are is two wings on the same bird, and the bird is what they're giving to the American people.
[00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.030]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:17.512]  Absolutely, and I appreciate your call.
[00:01:18.193 --> 00:01:24.418]  What they are is two different management teams bidding for control of the CEO job of this sector of the global imperium.
[00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:26.486]  And it's on record now.
[00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:27.227]  I mean, they admit it.
[00:01:27.927 --> 00:01:28.607]  They are criminal.
[00:01:28.647 --> 00:01:38.692]  That's why they've militarized the police, trained them to attack the people, trained them to violate the law, because they're making their move and they politically can't have us take the system back over and bring them to justice.
[00:01:39.113 --> 00:01:42.134]  Are you hearing about any CEOs to go to prison or any CEOs to get in trouble?
[00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:45.796]  You know, they've stole their trillions of dollars and they say, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:01:45.816 --> 00:01:46.956]  I'm sorry.
[00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:52.023]  I'm sorry, but we have a solution that will save you.
[00:01:52.063 --> 00:01:54.925]  A new global bank to control the entire planet.
[00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:56.846]  Everything's going to be alright.
[00:01:57.687 --> 00:02:01.590]  The very banking group that engineered it is now openly announcing world government.
[00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.451]  And that's my first question for Mark Dice.
[00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:06.033]  We're going to play some clips of him calling into radio shows.
[00:02:06.073 --> 00:02:11.217]  He does this and really has a big effect with Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly and many others.
[00:02:11.678 --> 00:02:14.760]  He's also an author of The Resistance Manifesto.
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.601]  Does a lot of great work.
[00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.043]  And he's also featured in our film
[00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:21.973]  Truth Rising, the 9-11 Chronicle's Truth Rising.
[00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:24.494]  He is Mark Dice.
[00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:26.414]  Mark, good to have you here with us today.
[00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:45.261]  Thank you, and I share probably everybody's sentiment about the fears and the anxieties of the rapid erosion of our country, but I think that, you know, I always try to look at the positive aspect, and I think that this current situation does present itself a good opportunity for us to educate people about
[00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.870]  What's going on?
[00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.391]  People are so selfish when we try to tell them about 9-11.
[00:02:50.132 --> 00:02:51.993]  They don't feel like they're directly connected.
[00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:57.017]  It's not them or their family members that are going over there and dying and fighting this bogus war.
[00:02:57.057 --> 00:02:59.879]  But now everybody's pocketbook is being hurt.
[00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.941]  Everyone's 401k is being eroded.
[00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:04.262]  Their jobs are disappearing.
[00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:06.903]  So now people are really looking for answers.
[00:03:06.943 --> 00:03:11.887]  And I think that this is a great opportunity for us now to really educate people as to what's going on.
[00:03:12.782 --> 00:03:17.106]  Yeah, you got death threats, and the son of Ronald Reagan said you should be killed.
[00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:18.147]  He would pay for your murder.
[00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:19.748]  He contracted for murder on the air.
[00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.890]  He never got in trouble for that.
[00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.014]  You know, he called you up, wanted to be buddy-buddy after he'd done it.
[00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:35.982]  That, of course, Michael Reagan, the fake conservative Judas Coat, helping lead us into the New World Order, along with his liberal counterparts on the other side of this wing of
[00:03:38.038 --> 00:03:39.938]  The other wing on this bird of prey.
[00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.360]  And of course you had the idea for everybody to mail Loose Change Final Cut, Endgame, Terror Storm.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.460]  Some of the best films out there to the troops.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.680]  I know that was done in mass.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.901]  I've gotten reports back that it's having a huge effect with the troops.
[00:03:55.341 --> 00:04:04.743]  Understanding how the terror attacks were staged and how special units of the US, British and Israeli forces have been caught mainstream news staging terror attacks dressed up like Arabs.
[00:04:05.263 --> 00:04:06.843]  And so that's having a big effect.
[00:04:07.843 --> 00:04:11.286]  I know that some of our information got to Pat Tillman.
[00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:14.408]  I know that he was going to go public about 9-11.
[00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:21.554]  He was going to go public about all sorts of issues, opium being grown over there, so they had to murder him.
[00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:25.777]  So, again, another great idea you had, Mark.
[00:04:26.858 --> 00:04:31.622]  Well, thanks, and that's one of the reasons why I continuously keep calling into these radio talk shows.
[00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:37.146]  It's partially to show, years ago, it was to show that they are gatekeepers, that they're mockingbirds, that they won't
[00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:38.346]  We're good to go.
[00:04:51.337 --> 00:04:59.741]  about the Bilderberg Group, and they hear their hero and their idol Sean Hannity or Michael Savage not want to talk about it or deny that they know anything about it.
[00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:01.002]  Curiosity is going to get them.
[00:05:01.022 --> 00:05:02.002]  They're going to go and Google it.
[00:05:02.022 --> 00:05:04.323]  They're going to check it out on YouTube, on Google Video.
[00:05:04.843 --> 00:05:10.766]  And so that's a way that we can help to educate these people also, and that's why they're... And they've gotten to where they know your voice.
[00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:12.707]  We need more people to do this, don't we?
[00:05:13.743 --> 00:05:15.684]  It's very difficult for me to do it now.
[00:05:15.744 --> 00:05:23.188]  The screeners know my voice, and I think that pretty soon they're going to go to a caller ID based system, so they're going to know who it is that's even calling into the switchboard.
[00:05:23.268 --> 00:05:29.551]  So, you know, it takes a lot of patience, but I have instructions on how to call into the shows on my website.
[00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:32.992]  Maybe we can talk about that later and get everybody to get onto the shows.
[00:05:33.532 --> 00:05:35.193]  And you can bypass the screener.
[00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:36.654]  You can sometimes get your call.
[00:05:37.264 --> 00:05:37.804]  It's a good question.
[00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:04.688]  It's a very, very difficult thing to do, but it's very, very important that everybody does this.
[00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:06.029]  Well, I'll tell you one of the tricks I've used.
[00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.610]  I learned this.
[00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:18.237]  That's why I went and got an Axis TV show almost 14 years ago and got on radio 13 years ago, is I was concerned about things I saw, gun control and things in Texas and other issues, and I would call in
[00:06:19.218 --> 00:06:20.899]  This is when I was in college to talk shows.
[00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:22.360]  I was right out of high school, like 18, 19.
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.422]  And they wouldn't let me on, but then they'd let idiots on.
[00:06:25.442 --> 00:06:29.104]  I learned to play the left-right paradigm and call in and act stupid.
[00:06:29.464 --> 00:06:31.905]  Then they'd put me on air, and I would then, you know, be normal.
[00:06:32.586 --> 00:06:34.947]  But yeah, you don't try to jump in and get it out real fast.
[00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:35.527]  You're like, hey,
[00:06:36.528 --> 00:06:42.454]  Yeah, no, on that topic, I wanted to get your take on this, on the bohemian grove and secret societies.
[00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:45.678]  You know, you've denied that exists, but it's in mainstream news it exists.
[00:06:45.698 --> 00:06:56.429]  You know, why are you... And then, once you know that's gotten out, once you've gone past, you know, the ten second delay or whatever, you go further and you start, you know, then firing out websites and things.
[00:06:57.145 --> 00:07:08.794]  He had a lot of callers think that it's probably like a show like yours where you just call up, you give your name and town, then you put in the call log, but you have to feed your question to a screener that's going to screen out any issues that they don't want to talk about.
[00:07:08.834 --> 00:07:12.617]  So you have to come up with a couple different issues of the day, just have a comment about it.
[00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:13.918]  You know, he loves it.
[00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:19.843]  I got through it the other day because Sean Hannity has a dating and online dating service for conservativehannity.com.
[00:07:19.863 --> 00:07:21.705]  So, you know, I told the screener, I said, Hey,
[00:07:22.185 --> 00:07:24.287]  I met my fiancé on Hannadate.com.
[00:07:24.307 --> 00:07:25.688]  I just wanted to thank Sean Hannity.
[00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:26.909]  So she's like, this is great!
[00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:28.130]  Puts me right through onto the air.
[00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.673]  As soon as I got on, I asked him about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:07:30.693 --> 00:07:41.242]  And so you just have to come up with an interesting comment or question about one of the particular main stories that are swirling around for the day or for the week, and then you can get on the call log and bypass them that way.
[00:07:42.123 --> 00:07:43.664]  Well done, Lord Vader!
[00:07:44.845 --> 00:07:47.207]  Well, on some of these calls, I mean, I post a lot of them.
[00:07:47.548 --> 00:07:48.989]  Dozens and dozens of them are on
[00:07:49.662 --> 00:08:11.455]  On the internet, on my site, on YouTube, I don't know if you have any of those calls linked up, but, you know, people wonder why is it that these guys won't talk about these issues, and it all goes back to Operation Mockingbird, which was started back in the 50s, and this is, again, this is not just me saying this or Alex saying this, there was a congressional hearing back in the 1970s, in the mid-70s, that uncovered that the CIA was paying
[00:08:11.935 --> 00:08:12.896]  Do you love America?
[00:08:13.016 --> 00:08:15.877]  Then love the military and join now to Fight Al Qaeda!
[00:08:33.826 --> 00:08:36.929]  Here's a quote directly from the Church Committee Investigations.
[00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:38.331]  This is a report published in 1976.
[00:08:38.711 --> 00:08:40.193]  So this isn't me saying this.
[00:08:40.233 --> 00:08:41.554]  This isn't Alex Jones saying this.
[00:08:41.574 --> 00:08:45.418]  This is directly from a Congressional hearing from the published report.
[00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:46.179]  And it says, quote,
[00:08:50.285 --> 00:08:51.145]  And now it's tens of thousands.
[00:08:51.165 --> 00:08:52.445]  That's why there's CIA recruiting ads everywhere.
[00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:53.906]  They're just taking everything over.
[00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:23.868]  And if you go back to the original writings of Adam Wysop in the Illuminati, they knew back in the late 1700s the power of the mainstream media.
[00:09:23.888 --> 00:09:26.891]  I mean, I have a degree, a bachelor's degree in communication.
[00:09:26.951 --> 00:09:29.693]  I studied mainstream media on a scholarly level.
[00:09:29.733 --> 00:09:37.079]  And if you look at Adam Wysop's own words, the original writings of the Illuminati were published and discovered back in 1786.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:45.947]  And Wysop's own words, he says, by establishing reading societies and subscription libraries and taking these under our direction and supplying them with our labors,
[00:09:46.465 --> 00:09:47.105]  We're good to go.
[00:10:06.252 --> 00:10:14.818]  To Operation Mockingbird, and you wonder why they won't talk about any of these issues, because they have a list of topics that are not to be discussed.
[00:10:14.878 --> 00:10:20.721]  And, you know, nobody's going to approach Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh and say, you're now going to be part of Operation Mockingbird.
[00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:25.524]  They're obviously going to have dinner with them, and they're going to say, look, you know, you're in a really influential position.
[00:10:25.944 --> 00:10:30.547]  We need your help to ensure the security of the country and the party.
[00:10:31.358 --> 00:10:34.081]  They're provided with lists of what to say, what not to say.
[00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:43.029]  Scott McClellan, the former White House Press Secretary, admitted on CNN that Fox News reporters and others receive daily talking points from the White House.
[00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:48.154]  Oh no, they had the top six talk show hosts to the White House and openly gave them talking points publicly.
[00:10:48.194 --> 00:10:51.697]  See, once they've been caught, they're now just trying to hide it in plain view.
[00:10:52.658 --> 00:10:54.660]  They're just like, ho-hum, like it's no big deal.
[00:10:55.253 --> 00:11:06.140]  And it's no secret, I mean, anybody that has a job, you're going to get orders and memos that are going to tell you public policy and policies for your store, for your job, for your industry.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.603]  You know, you're going to push a particular product, you're going to downplay this particular thing.
[00:11:11.864 --> 00:11:16.246]  Well, I mean, ten years ago, Mark, I would hear Limbaugh say the CFR doesn't exist.
[00:11:16.687 --> 00:11:21.370]  How does he deal with it now being all over TV, admitting world government, but they're saying world government's a good thing?
[00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:27.253]  And he still hangs up on you and calls you a kook and plays black helicopter noises.
[00:11:27.473 --> 00:11:28.534]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:32.396]  Yeah, now they'll admit that it exists, but it doesn't really matter.
[00:11:32.916 --> 00:11:40.620]  You know, if you have the call queued up of Michael Savage last week when I asked him about the Bilderberg Group, you can hear him say that the Bilderberg Group doesn't matter.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.721]  He knows all about it.
[00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:43.702]  The CFR, it just doesn't matter.
[00:11:43.722 --> 00:11:44.663]  We don't need to go there.
[00:11:46.328 --> 00:11:56.271]  Yeah, we need to play the left off against the right, and the right off against the left all day, and Professor Wiener, who wrote love stories to his special friends, we'll be right back.
[00:11:56.991 --> 00:12:04.633]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[00:12:05.053 --> 00:12:06.234]  You need the Paclite.
[00:12:06.674 --> 00:12:14.496]  The Paclite is the longest lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[00:12:14.876 --> 00:12:18.057]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:22.859]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:29.202]  The Paclite is so durable, soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[00:12:29.642 --> 00:12:33.944]  The Paclite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:12:34.304 --> 00:12:40.967]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlight.com.
[00:12:41.307 --> 00:12:43.868]  That address again is 9voltlight.com.
[00:12:44.868 --> 00:12:46.390]  Or, call us today at 877-715-4448.
[00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:46.670]  That's 877-715-4448.
[00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.195]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:12:51.215 --> 00:12:53.118]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.721]  Who is the enemy?
[00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:07.742]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:08.042 --> 00:13:09.023]  This is his ammo.
[00:13:09.043 --> 00:13:10.344]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:12.086]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:12.406 --> 00:13:19.152]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:19.552 --> 00:13:19.993]  Some U.S.
[00:13:20.053 --> 00:13:25.698]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:26.378 --> 00:13:29.901]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:30.261 --> 00:13:40.128]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:13:40.368 --> 00:13:41.109]  Fabled enemies.

[00:13:49.334 --> 00:13:52.697]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:13:56.109 --> 00:13:57.690]  Ted Anderson from Midas, February 12, 2008.
[00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.031]  Gold 94040.
[00:13:58.291 --> 00:14:00.853]  House gold coins can be purchased for 967.37, 483.68 for half, 241.84 for quarter.
[00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:01.133]  That's 967.37, 483.68, 241.84.
[00:14:13.653 --> 00:14:19.079]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:22.663]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[00:14:22.743 --> 00:14:23.604]  Bad news for U.S.
[00:14:23.644 --> 00:14:24.105]  currency.
[00:14:24.325 --> 00:14:26.387]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[00:14:26.527 --> 00:14:27.809]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:30.109]  Dollars fall into 65% of Euro.
[00:14:30.249 --> 00:14:31.270]  Erosion accelerates.
[00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.870]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of the U.S.
[00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.830]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.371]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[00:14:38.571 --> 00:14:39.491]  Why attack Iran?
[00:14:39.591 --> 00:14:42.472]  Jerome O'Coursey's Iran leads attack against the U.S.
[00:14:42.512 --> 00:14:43.892]  dollar document spells it out.
[00:14:43.992 --> 00:14:46.292]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:46.392 --> 00:14:49.713]  The value of your hard-earned money is being destroyed in a global game of chess.
[00:14:49.853 --> 00:14:50.873]  Call 800-686-2237 for Coursey's report today.
[00:14:50.893 --> 00:14:51.193]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:59.205]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:04.629]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:10.233]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:15:10.613 --> 00:15:11.734]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:15:12.094 --> 00:15:20.981]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:15:21.401 --> 00:15:23.042]  Now, compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:27.404]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:15.904]  You know, LaGrange is right on the road from here.
[00:16:16.064 --> 00:16:21.645]  Oh, you go hunting down there?
[00:16:21.805 --> 00:16:24.606]  ZZ Top didn't go there to go hunting.
[00:16:25.366 --> 00:16:26.506]  The famous whorehouse there.
[00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:32.679]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back to Mark Dice.
[00:16:32.819 --> 00:16:33.880]  Mark, we've got these clips.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.301]  You want to go to the Michael Savage first?
[00:16:36.282 --> 00:16:38.744]  Yeah, this is about a week ago, two weeks ago.
[00:16:39.304 --> 00:16:48.332]  Michael Savage is probably one of the least controlled individuals of the mainstream media, but he again
[00:16:50.194 --> 00:16:51.114]  Plays it off.
[00:16:51.194 --> 00:16:58.177]  And before we do that, here's a quote from an individual back in the 70s that was involved with Operation Mockingbird, Thomas Brayden.
[00:16:58.538 --> 00:17:06.221]  He was the head of the International Organizations Division, which is an element within the CIA that basically implemented this operation.
[00:17:06.281 --> 00:17:15.345]  And he openly admitted after the hearing, quote, if the CIA director wanted to extend a present, I think he called it, suppose he thought this man could use $50,000.
[00:17:16.345 --> 00:17:17.946]  He's working well and doing a good job.
[00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:20.975]  He could hand it to him and never have to account to anybody.
[00:17:20.995 --> 00:17:29.121]  There was simply no limit to the money he could spend, no limit to the people that he could hire, no limit to the activities it could decide.
[00:17:29.221 --> 00:17:34.826]  And then today we have the Army going around for two decades, we know of, buying off most of the mayors and police chiefs.
[00:17:35.606 --> 00:17:40.310]  When you wonder, you look at Rush Limbaugh's $400 million contract.
[00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:41.631]  More money than the show makes.
[00:17:42.332 --> 00:17:46.215]  Sean Hannity's tens of millions of dollars that he gets a year.
[00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:50.212]  These individuals are not working class like they try to play it off.
[00:17:50.252 --> 00:17:53.973]  Sean Hannity's big shtick is that he's against the mainstream media.
[00:17:54.213 --> 00:17:56.794]  He couldn't get more mainstream media himself.
[00:17:58.615 --> 00:18:00.595]  Let's go ahead and play this Michael Savage clip.
[00:18:00.615 --> 00:18:01.416]  Tell us what happened here.
[00:18:03.536 --> 00:18:14.360]  Well luckily it's difficult again to get through to these people so I fed the screener a typical left versus right question and then went on the air I just simply asked him
[00:18:14.758 --> 00:18:22.464]  You know, he was talking about how there's a conspiracy, actually, to destroy the economy, but it was only the Democrats who were conspiring.
[00:18:22.524 --> 00:18:29.430]  So, I just thought I would ask him if he wanted to go a little deeper in what he could tell everybody about the Bilderberg Group's role in that conspiracy.
[00:18:30.711 --> 00:18:31.151]  Here it is.
[00:18:32.092 --> 00:18:33.853]  Right here on the Savage Nation, San Diego.
[00:18:33.873 --> 00:18:34.814]  Mark, go ahead, please.
[00:18:35.785 --> 00:18:37.646]  Let's talk about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:41.009]  You're talking about conspiracies to bankrupt the economy.
[00:18:41.409 --> 00:18:46.793]  What can you tell the audience about the Bilderberg Group, and why isn't that mentioned ever in any means?
[00:18:46.833 --> 00:18:49.435]  Well, that's like talking about the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:50.856]  It's too esoteric for the audience.
[00:18:50.936 --> 00:18:58.621]  I don't think we have to go any further than Obama, Geithner, Nancy Pelosi, and, excuse me, Dianne Feinstein and Hillary Clinton.
[00:18:58.661 --> 00:18:59.402]  Is that enough for you?
[00:18:59.922 --> 00:19:01.083]  We don't need a Bilderberg Group.
[00:19:01.103 --> 00:19:03.665]  We have the Democrat Socialist Group that I just mentioned.
[00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:13.476]  Every year the Bilderberg Group meets in secret and Obama- We know this, we understand it, but I don't want to talk about some ex-esoteric group called the Bilderberg Group.
[00:19:13.897 --> 00:19:22.543]  What we have is a democrat socialist group run by Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, Dianne Feinstein, and the others.
[00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:24.484]  What do we have to look at the Bilderberg Group for?
[00:19:25.131 --> 00:19:27.752]  Because it's not only Democrat, it's Republican as well.
[00:19:27.932 --> 00:19:30.834]  They understand they operate both sides of the coin, Michael.
[00:19:30.894 --> 00:19:32.514]  And you're keeping your audience in the dark.
[00:19:32.554 --> 00:19:35.416]  I think you're doing everybody a tremendous disservice.
[00:19:35.436 --> 00:19:36.476]  Don't tell me what I'm doing.
[00:19:36.496 --> 00:19:38.437]  Get your own talk show if you want to do them a service.
[00:19:38.717 --> 00:19:42.059]  What good is going to come of talking about the Bilderberg Group, which I've heard since 1990?
[00:19:43.059 --> 00:19:44.260]  Tell me what good is going to come of it.
[00:19:44.853 --> 00:19:45.733]  Why don't we expose them?
[00:19:45.753 --> 00:19:46.753]  Maybe they're violating the law.
[00:19:46.773 --> 00:19:49.354]  What needs to be exposed is Obama's hypocrisy.
[00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:53.275]  So that the idiots finally get it and stop him before he does more damage.
[00:19:53.775 --> 00:19:54.835]  That's what needs to be done.
[00:19:55.135 --> 00:19:57.836]  Not talking about some esoteric conspiracy group.
[00:19:58.196 --> 00:19:58.816]  Thanks for the call.
[00:19:58.836 --> 00:19:59.736]  You're 100% wrong.
[00:20:00.716 --> 00:20:06.017]  Yeah, let's not talk about who actually financed him, or where Geithner's from, or that he met secretly with Hillary there.
[00:20:06.497 --> 00:20:07.918]  That they're the people that control the banks.
[00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:08.898]  It's all Obama.
[00:20:08.918 --> 00:20:11.838]  And then they'll give us a new puppet, and let's only talk about the new puppet.
[00:20:12.179 --> 00:20:14.159]  Let's only talk about Bush, and we talk about Obama.
[00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:15.451]  They don't?
[00:20:15.611 --> 00:20:15.992]  Oh, no!
[00:20:16.252 --> 00:20:18.574]  And he insults his audience there, Mark Dice.
[00:20:18.855 --> 00:20:20.937]  He says, oh, they won't understand it.
[00:20:20.977 --> 00:20:21.958]  It's too esoteric.
[00:20:22.879 --> 00:20:33.309]  Yeah, and we don't need to talk about the esoteric conspiracy group, the Skull and Bones Society, either, even though President Bush made six appointments from his fellow Skull and Bones members.
[00:20:33.369 --> 00:20:37.073]  I mean, if you just look at Bush and who he appointed to key positions,
[00:20:37.458 --> 00:20:42.161]  The Chairman of the Security and Exchange Commission was a skull and bones man, William Donaldson.
[00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:47.824]  The General Counsel in the Department of Homeland Security, Bush, had nominated Edward McNally.
[00:20:47.964 --> 00:20:49.665]  But the issue isn't even that.
[00:20:49.785 --> 00:20:54.127]  It was founded, according to even the Encyclopedia, from narcotics trafficking.
[00:20:54.967 --> 00:20:57.769]  And the entire CIA was founded out of it.
[00:20:58.328 --> 00:21:09.018]  Yeah, and when you have heads of these major institutions, all skull and bones members, such a small private fraternity, obviously there's this private network going on.
[00:21:09.078 --> 00:21:17.286]  Victor Ashe was nominated to the board of directors of Fannie Mae, the wonderful federal national mortgage association.
[00:21:17.326 --> 00:21:21.450]  You've got Evan Gabriel was nominated secretary of defense.
[00:21:21.994 --> 00:21:23.534]  We're on the march.
[00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:24.955]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:50.991 --> 00:21:53.795]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.623]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:22:01.223 --> 00:22:03.706]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:22:04.307 --> 00:22:08.472]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:10.962]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:22:11.343 --> 00:22:14.345]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:22:14.725 --> 00:22:17.727]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.

[00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.712]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:22:58.833 --> 00:23:01.235]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:23:01.255 --> 00:23:03.818]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:23:03.838 --> 00:23:05.059]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:06.701]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:09.624]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:23:09.684 --> 00:23:13.328]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:23:22.969 --> 00:23:27.842]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:29.099 --> 00:23:30.279]  An inside job?
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.720]  How dare you?
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:39.122]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:39.142 --> 00:23:41.942]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:42.022 --> 00:23:48.224]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:24:45.346 --> 00:24:46.666]  They don't want to see us unite.
[00:25:08.672 --> 00:25:14.627]  All they want us to do is keep on fussing and fighting.
[00:25:14.707 --> 00:25:17.654]  They don't want to see us living.
[00:25:40.612 --> 00:25:41.813]  Going back to Mark Dice in a moment.
[00:25:41.833 --> 00:25:44.014]  We're going to give him eight minutes over into the next hour.

[00:25:44.975 --> 00:25:46.896]  Then we got Russell Means joining us.
[00:25:46.916 --> 00:25:49.798]  Want to stay tuned for that as well.
[00:25:54.521 --> 00:25:58.523]  Before we go back to Mark Dice, I want to tell you who's making this hour possible.
[00:25:58.583 --> 00:25:59.744]  It's our fine sponsors.
[00:26:00.104 --> 00:26:01.825]  But I believe in each and every one of these sponsors.
[00:26:01.845 --> 00:26:02.806]  High quality products.
[00:26:03.346 --> 00:26:04.687]  Things you need to be prepared.
[00:26:05.188 --> 00:26:06.689]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:15.749]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:22.372]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrims for example, when seeds had the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[00:26:22.732 --> 00:26:25.593]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds, waged by the global elite.
[00:26:26.054 --> 00:26:28.154]  They want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[00:26:28.495 --> 00:26:34.137]  Governments are storing seeds, the UN is storing seeds, globalists of every stripe are storing seeds near the Arctic Circle.
[00:26:34.657 --> 00:26:36.078]  Solutions from science is trying to get
[00:26:36.798 --> 00:26:42.561]  The seeds out of the globalist's hands, into the hands of the people, one seed bank at a time, one family at a time.
[00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:51.686]  And I just hope that you will visit their website, survivalseedbank.com, survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call, 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, survivalseedbank.com.
[00:27:01.278 --> 00:27:10.327]  And along that same line of being prepared is another one of the great products from Solutions From Science.
[00:27:10.767 --> 00:27:12.869]  And that's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.271]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[00:27:15.311 --> 00:27:16.572]  Hurricanes, snow, ice, and storms.
[00:27:16.633 --> 00:27:18.634]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid.
[00:27:19.395 --> 00:27:20.716]  Here's a great way to do just that.
[00:27:20.736 --> 00:27:24.498]  The solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor Solutions from Science.
[00:27:24.838 --> 00:27:28.500]  Designed to provide 1,800 watts of power and on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:36.385]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the power source, 1,800 power plant and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[00:27:37.085 --> 00:27:42.286]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in blackouts, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[00:27:42.666 --> 00:27:46.047]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[00:27:46.107 --> 00:27:49.608]  MySolarBackup.com, MySolarBackup.com, or 877-327-0365.
[00:27:49.628 --> 00:27:49.668]  877-327-0365.
[00:27:49.688 --> 00:27:50.548]  A great little unit.
[00:27:50.648 --> 00:27:51.688]  Okay, going back to Mark Dice.
[00:28:01.109 --> 00:28:07.090]  Mark, continuing, I want to get into the bailout, the banker takeover, the awakening that's happening, but let's play some more of these clips.
[00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.711]  You want to play Sean Hannity or Alan Combs next?
[00:28:10.771 --> 00:28:20.253]  Let's play the Sean Hannity clip and notice how as soon as he denies any existence of the Bilderberg Group, he doesn't ask me to clarify or anything like that.
[00:28:20.313 --> 00:28:23.413]  The call is dropped and he immediately goes to the next caller.
[00:28:23.453 --> 00:28:26.474]  So he's still in the old limbo mode of just saying none of it exists.
[00:28:27.082 --> 00:28:30.105]  Oh, he's doing his very best to make sure that it's not going to get on the air.
[00:28:30.185 --> 00:28:40.655]  I actually, a few days later, got through again and asked him another question about the Bilderberg Group and then he mentioned, he laughed at me and then he said, ha, we zapped you.
[00:28:40.975 --> 00:28:42.696]  That didn't even get on the air, buddy.
[00:28:43.057 --> 00:28:47.961]  And then the only thing you heard on the actual air was, you know, let's go to Mark in San Diego.
[00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:50.323]  Oh, let's go to, you know, Bill and such and such.
[00:28:50.364 --> 00:28:52.686]  And so I didn't even get on the air whatsoever.
[00:28:53.046 --> 00:28:55.568]  You see, they revel in keeping people in the dark.
[00:28:55.628 --> 00:28:57.128]  They revel in using you.
[00:28:57.329 --> 00:29:03.392]  They revel in, God bless you, God bless America, we're going to raise money for dead troops' children.
[00:29:03.592 --> 00:29:04.453]  Oh, Sean!
[00:29:04.813 --> 00:29:07.435]  Oh, Sean, you're so good, Sean!
[00:29:08.155 --> 00:29:12.438]  And, I mean, they are just enemies of the Republic, just like all the liberals on the other side.
[00:29:12.878 --> 00:29:15.359]  So, he is saying it doesn't exist.
[00:29:15.399 --> 00:29:16.100]  Here's that clip.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.001]  Anyway, thanks for the call, Mark.
[00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:19.342]  KFMB, San Diego.
[00:29:19.382 --> 00:29:20.603]  Next, Sean Hannity Show.
[00:29:20.643 --> 00:29:21.143]  How are you, Mark?
[00:29:21.812 --> 00:29:35.477]  Pretty good, but with all this economic crisis going on and everybody looking for answers and blame, I was wondering if you could talk about the Bilderberg Group and the role that they play in the global economy and geopolitics.
[00:29:35.957 --> 00:29:37.638]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:29:37.678 --> 00:29:41.119]  Let's go to Amy in Cincinnati, 55KRC.
[00:29:41.139 --> 00:29:41.779]  What's up, Amy?
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.780]  Hey, Sean, how are you?
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:44.680]  Good, how are you?
[00:29:45.441 --> 00:29:45.701]  Great.
[00:29:45.721 --> 00:29:47.961]  I just wanted to let you know you're a great American.
[00:29:48.362 --> 00:29:49.382]  Thank you, you're a great American.
[00:29:50.984 --> 00:29:57.109]  You're a great American, as the North American Union comes in, as the global government takes over, as the foreign banks openly rape us.
[00:29:57.549 --> 00:30:01.993]  You know, this is a challenge to Sean Hannity and the rest of them.
[00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:05.976]  Here's Time Magazine, an article titled, The New World Order, Thursday, February 5th.
[00:30:06.036 --> 00:30:06.837]  There's hundreds of these.
[00:30:07.757 --> 00:30:11.440]  And it says here in paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[00:30:15.043 --> 00:30:18.306]  In paragraph 9, now the whole thing says stuff as well, but
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.541]  He goes on to say, the only thing that can save America and the world, and the whole article blames the U.S.
[00:30:23.561 --> 00:30:24.601]  for what's happening, not the bankers.
[00:30:25.461 --> 00:30:27.182]  It says, in the view of many outside the U.S.
[00:30:27.222 --> 00:30:34.864]  and some within, the only way to limit such excess is through a bigger, more powerful IMF that can act as a central bank to the world and knock heads when needed.
[00:30:35.104 --> 00:30:37.985]  When you read the real proposals, it's a government you pay taxes to.
[00:30:38.265 --> 00:30:41.446]  While everybody agrees that the IMF needs to be less dominated by the U.S.
[00:30:41.486 --> 00:30:42.166]  and Western Europe,
[00:30:44.226 --> 00:30:47.328]  Things get controversial as soon as you go past voting rights.
[00:30:47.768 --> 00:30:49.369]  Should capital flows be restricted?
[00:30:49.689 --> 00:30:51.770]  Should there be limits on the trade deficits and surpluses?
[00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:55.372]  Should the IMF be able to order around even the United States?
[00:30:56.012 --> 00:30:57.373]  And that's what they're setting up.
[00:30:57.413 --> 00:30:58.353]  That's Bretton Woods too.
[00:30:58.774 --> 00:31:02.756]  But I mean, you know, Hannity says he has no idea about this, Mark Dice.
[00:31:03.856 --> 00:31:07.098]  Yeah, and even if that were true, then he would have to be
[00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:11.704]  One of the stupidest national supposed expert talk show hosts.
[00:31:11.764 --> 00:31:27.538]  I mean, here are these people, you know, their listeners obviously assume that they're these genius, hyper enlightened individuals that know all the inner workings of the government and foreign relations and all the different nuances of politics, but... They think they're me!
[00:31:27.578 --> 00:31:28.619]  I'm sorry.
[00:31:28.899 --> 00:31:32.903]  He doesn't know about this big, powerful group that is really at the key
[00:31:33.847 --> 00:31:40.192]  At the center making all these decisions and directing anything, and like Savage said, we don't need to go past Obama.
[00:31:40.212 --> 00:31:44.715]  Well, we do need to go past Obama because he's the one that's taking orders from the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:45.596 --> 00:31:49.018]  Well, I mean, think about what Michael Weiner Savage said.
[00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:57.244]  Michael Weiner Savage says, yeah, it's real, but I don't care about a secret conspiracy group that runs the president.
[00:31:57.925 --> 00:31:59.626]  Well, the audience can't understand it.
[00:32:01.563 --> 00:32:04.785]  He admitted on his own words that the audience can't understand it.
[00:32:04.805 --> 00:32:06.846]  I have another interesting story.
[00:32:06.866 --> 00:32:16.593]  I can't take the full credit for helping to wake Keith Olbermann up, but I was in contact with his producer several years ago, trying to get him to cover the bohemian growth.
[00:32:16.613 --> 00:32:24.538]  I knew that everybody knows Keith Olbermann is no fan of President Bush, and I thought that they could do a nice story, even if it would be a slanted politically
[00:32:25.038 --> 00:32:25.658]  We're good to go.
[00:32:45.047 --> 00:32:49.710]  I said, look Greg, his name is Greg Cockwell, I said, you know, this is no joke, this is no hoax.
[00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:54.933]  I mean, I'll put you into contact with Alex Jones, with these individuals that have seen it with their own eyes, that have the video footage.
[00:32:55.274 --> 00:33:01.037]  Here's a National Geographic article showing a ritual and it says that it still exists.
[00:33:01.077 --> 00:33:04.019]  And he says, no, I know, I know you're telling the truth.
[00:33:04.419 --> 00:33:09.663]  He said that I opened up a whole new world for him, but he said he would never be able to take it to the air.
[00:33:10.282 --> 00:33:11.925]  Well let me say this about Oberman.
[00:33:12.506 --> 00:33:21.181]  He's really showing his colors right now by coming out with this disinfo a federal court says.
[00:33:22.199 --> 00:33:24.341]  There's no link to autism from vaccines?
[00:33:24.781 --> 00:33:27.963]  And then he tries to claim one study, some doctor fudged something?
[00:33:28.344 --> 00:33:31.406]  I mean, there were no autistic children 30, 40 years ago.
[00:33:31.706 --> 00:33:36.350]  When I was a kid, you never... Now you go to the movies and take your children, the front two rows are autistic.
[00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:37.971]  And they say, oh, they're faking.
[00:33:38.412 --> 00:33:39.693]  Oh, I mean, I feel sorry for these children.
[00:33:39.713 --> 00:33:42.134]  I mean, they're like, literally just in like...
[00:33:43.296 --> 00:33:44.557]  I mean, they're gone, man.
[00:33:44.918 --> 00:33:46.580]  And I've had top brain surgeons on.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:51.186]  It attacks the brain, not just the mercury, but it causes an autoimmune response.
[00:33:51.726 --> 00:33:55.131]  They admit Gardasil's killing people right now, but they don't care!
[00:33:55.151 --> 00:33:56.873]  And Oberman makes me sick.
[00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:58.631]  Your take on that?
[00:33:58.751 --> 00:34:01.032]  We bullhorned him for like three hours.
[00:34:01.052 --> 00:34:01.573]  We were tired.
[00:34:01.593 --> 00:34:03.474]  We'd been physically attacked in Denver.
[00:34:03.935 --> 00:34:06.316]  Oberman's producer came out and begged for us to stop.
[00:34:06.336 --> 00:34:11.140]  We said, OK, because Keith exposed Cheney wanting to blow up US ships in Lebanon and Iran using Navy SEALs.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:11.840]  We're done.
[00:34:12.361 --> 00:34:12.901]  I asked the group.
[00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:13.462]  I said, are you done?
[00:34:13.502 --> 00:34:14.282]  Yeah, we're tired anyways.
[00:34:14.622 --> 00:34:16.244]  And then Oberman came up and said, thank you to us.
[00:34:16.264 --> 00:34:17.645]  And we got video and a photo of that.
[00:34:18.245 --> 00:34:20.947]  But the point is that now I should have just kept giving it to him.
[00:34:21.448 --> 00:34:21.708]  Go ahead.
[00:34:22.586 --> 00:34:27.873]  Yeah, he's in a position where he can only go so far, even if he really understands the whole truth.
[00:34:27.933 --> 00:34:30.717]  He's not going to betray his audience or risk his job.
[00:34:31.558 --> 00:34:33.321]  The same is true with Alan Combs.
[00:34:37.087 --> 00:34:46.675]  All of these people have to know, and maybe even if some of them wanted to speak out from their position against the Bush administration, all the Democrats are obviously anti-Bush.
[00:34:46.715 --> 00:34:55.862]  Even if they wanted to speak out about such things as the false flag attacks, Cheney wanting to do such things, they would really risk their job.
[00:34:55.882 --> 00:34:58.505]  And so, yeah, Olbermann is not going to be in that position.
[00:34:58.885 --> 00:35:01.327]  He's not going to want to lose his several million dollars.
[00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:02.988]  I don't think so.
[00:35:20.245 --> 00:35:21.686]  It's widely available on YouTube.
[00:35:21.726 --> 00:35:22.566]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:35:22.606 --> 00:35:23.626]  Beck's running a PSYOP.
[00:35:23.646 --> 00:35:26.648]  When Ron Paul had a chance to win, he came out and said, Ron Paul is dangerous.
[00:35:27.268 --> 00:35:28.568]  His members are going to attack.
[00:35:28.608 --> 00:35:29.069]  The U.S.
[00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:31.790]  military needs to be used against them and 9-11 truthers.
[00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.671]  And you notice all the shows said that the same week.
[00:35:34.951 --> 00:35:35.651]  It was a script.
[00:35:35.691 --> 00:35:36.272]  Word for word.
[00:35:36.332 --> 00:35:41.374]  Hannity, O'Reilly, The Morning Joe on MSNBC.
[00:35:42.114 --> 00:35:42.914]  It's in Truth Rising.
[00:35:42.934 --> 00:35:45.355]  They all say, taser them, torture them, take them to camps.
[00:35:45.395 --> 00:35:46.116]  And they're serious.
[00:35:46.556 --> 00:35:49.297]  And then we show a video of them actually arresting 9-11 truthers for
[00:35:49.517 --> 00:35:53.339]  Being on street corners, and dragging them off saying they're terrorists for having signs.
[00:35:54.941 --> 00:35:59.163]  And then once it was too late, and now they think they're safe, they know everybody's awake to them.
[00:36:00.204 --> 00:36:04.707]  So now he's suddenly, oh my gosh, foreign banks are taking us over, it's a new world order.
[00:36:04.727 --> 00:36:09.130]  But see, now suddenly it's in the Financial Times of London, published by a Bilderberg group member.
[00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:10.851]  Now it's in Time and Newsweek.
[00:36:11.191 --> 00:36:17.075]  Now it's okay to admit the world government, and he'll play the part of the little voice that's against it.
[00:36:17.535 --> 00:36:19.897]  So he can later betray people by getting trust.
[00:36:20.597 --> 00:36:23.819]  Well, that's probably part of the reason why he was taken over by Fox News.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.024]  He used to have his television show on CNN, and I think probably he didn't have a tight enough leash on him over there.
[00:36:30.124 --> 00:36:41.412]  So Rupert Murdoch and that crew over there needed to pull him over to Fox News so that they could teach him the ways of the true force of propaganda and of Fox News.
[00:36:41.472 --> 00:36:43.193]  And, you know, this goes along
[00:36:44.057 --> 00:36:52.379]  With the religious beliefs of these individuals, the high-level Masons, the Illuminati, which maybe we can get into here in a little bit.
[00:36:53.099 --> 00:37:07.943]  They are liars, they are propagandists, they keep their own belief systems to themselves and dispense false ideas where you look at most religions, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, any major
[00:37:08.604 --> 00:37:17.587]  Mainstream religion wants people to learn about the truth of their religion, learn about the principles, to understand kind of their place in the universe.
[00:37:18.687 --> 00:37:19.848]  They're not secret.
[00:37:20.128 --> 00:37:22.729]  I mean, Rob Jacobson, who works here, had a great way of putting it.
[00:37:23.229 --> 00:37:29.471]  If your religious group is secret and has different sub-guilds, the secret is they're worshiping the devil.
[00:37:30.282 --> 00:37:34.047]  And any group you look at that's like that, you always find that.
[00:37:34.107 --> 00:37:34.408]  Go ahead.
[00:37:34.929 --> 00:37:44.462]  Yeah, you can walk into, with the exception of some splinter groups that have taken the teachings and turned them into a cult, any Christian church, any mosque, any...
[00:37:44.963 --> 00:37:52.307]  You know, any temple, you can go in and learn the principles of that religion, except for these high-level groups, these masons, the skull-and-bones individuals.
[00:37:52.347 --> 00:37:58.570]  And if you look at their own writings again, which, you know, I did a lot of writing in college, and you can't just make a claim.
[00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:59.891]  You have to source it.
[00:37:59.951 --> 00:38:00.851]  And so that's what I do.
[00:38:01.492 --> 00:38:06.614]  I find the sources for all these, so that people, they know where this information's coming from.
[00:38:06.654 --> 00:38:08.495]  It's not just my interpretation of this.
[00:38:08.535 --> 00:38:09.396]  It's not just something I...
[00:38:10.209 --> 00:38:11.630]  Saw on a random website.
[00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:37.448]  Here is a quote from Albert Pike in his 1872 book, Morals and Dogma, which is considered the Bible of Freemasonry, and he openly admits, quote, Masonry, like all religions, all mysteries, conceals its secrets from all except the adepts and the sages or the elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of the symbols to lead those who deserve to be misled to conceal the truth, which it, the Mason,
[00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:38.811]  Call it what you want.
[00:38:54.883 --> 00:38:58.504]  It's just a fraternity for a bunch of guys, but that's the case on the lower levels.
[00:38:58.544 --> 00:39:10.767]  When you start getting up to the 30th degree, the 33rd degree, you know, Pike admits on page 213 in Morals and Dogma, every Masonic lodge is a temple of religion and its teachings are instructions in religion.
[00:39:10.787 --> 00:39:13.727]  And so, yeah, you know, that can be the most disturbing point.
[00:39:14.287 --> 00:39:19.829]  It's not addressed a lot when we're discussing the New World Order, but these groups do worship Lucifer.
[00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:21.229]  They worship Satan.
[00:39:22.495 --> 00:39:29.139]  Religion, that's their worldview, and we can get into that in a little more detail, and that was the same issue with the Nazis.
[00:39:29.399 --> 00:39:49.590]  And people look at the Nazis and obviously know that they're evil, that they were just corrupt to the core, completely out of control, mega-maniacal group that hated everybody and that just ruthlessly killed millions of people, but at the core of it was a religious teaching, and Hitler himself was a student of
[00:39:50.225 --> 00:39:50.865]  We're good to go.
[00:40:10.427 --> 00:40:13.208]  Doubt it not, that's on page 321 of that.
[00:40:13.228 --> 00:40:16.749]  And the letters he wrote, he said, I feel the power of Lucifer seething in my hands.
[00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:19.671]  That was Manly P. Hall in one of his books.
[00:40:19.751 --> 00:40:21.211]  Yeah, he admitted that.
[00:40:21.231 --> 00:40:25.733]  I believe Pike wrote a letter, I believe that's the term, but I guess Hall wrote it too, but I'm going from memory.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.981]  And this is the teaching that these people adhere to.
[00:40:30.181 --> 00:40:36.703]  And you talk to low-level masons and they go, oh no, see they test you and if you're a good guy, they just use you and you stay low-level.
[00:40:36.723 --> 00:40:40.083]  But if you're down with the game, come on up to the Hellfire Club.
[00:40:40.844 --> 00:40:50.306]  To get into the original Bavarian Illuminati, the new recruit was blindfolded and given a knife and was told that they had to stab and kill an individual that had betrayed their order.
[00:40:50.859 --> 00:40:59.162]  And it really was just, it was an animal, it was a tuft of cotton or something and they had to stab into this sheep or into this animal.
[00:41:00.256 --> 00:41:08.080]  into something and then they would be unblindfolded and realize that it wasn't a person because they wanted to test them to see if they would in fact kill for the group.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:20.005]  Well, that's gang psychology and that's why different street gangs have you go out and kill somebody or first rob to get in the group and then kill somebody to become operational because now you're compromised, now you've proven, now you've gone over.
[00:41:20.386 --> 00:41:24.968]  You know, going back to Sean Hannity and people denying that there's a New World Order or a Bilderberg Trilateral Commission,
[00:41:26.108 --> 00:41:52.334]  uh... when all their friends are in it and of course they're aware of it I've seen Sean Hannity say every militia member should be arrested every child needs a chip and oh it's so conservative that's like uh... the FBI director J. Edgar Hoover before Congress in the fifties saying organized crime doesn't exist LaCosa Nostra is a conspiracy theory he's the first one to say that now
[00:41:53.530 --> 00:42:04.435]  There was an individual that was arrested, I can't remember his name, but he was one of the first people to really expose the Italian Mafia, and he was locked up in a mental institution.
[00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:16.501]  This is on the History Channel, actually, on one of their specials, On the Mob, and this man came forward and he explained how the mob worked, what kinds of businesses they had their hands in, how powerful they were.
[00:42:17.043 --> 00:42:17.523]  I don't think so.
[00:42:33.001 --> 00:42:36.684]  There was a famous author, Ezra Pound, Pulitzer Prize winner.
[00:42:37.265 --> 00:42:41.929]  He wrote a book about the Federal Reserve, and they locked him up in a mental institution, said, is not private.
[00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.951]  You're going to a mental institution.
[00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:44.912]  Today, everybody knows it.
[00:42:45.172 --> 00:42:51.758]  So see, they deny the New World Order while they're building it, and then now they think it's too late, so they're going, yeah, we're taking over.
[00:42:52.679 --> 00:42:53.880]  It's the only future you got.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.521]  Mark Dice is our guest.

[00:43:22.855 --> 00:43:24.937]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.

[00:44:03.445 --> 00:44:05.106]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:06.075 --> 00:44:07.096]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:07.616 --> 00:44:08.116]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:08.417 --> 00:44:09.397]  This is his M.O.
[00:44:09.417 --> 00:44:10.738]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:10.778 --> 00:44:12.439]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:12.779 --> 00:44:19.524]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:19.924 --> 00:44:20.384]  Some U.S.
[00:44:20.404 --> 00:44:26.088]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:26.748 --> 00:44:30.270]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:33.331]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:44:56.758 --> 00:45:00.061]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.

[00:46:07.878 --> 00:46:11.500]  We got Russell Means, Native American leader, been involved in
[00:46:13.888 --> 00:46:16.269]  Fracas is with the Federales.
[00:46:16.289 --> 00:46:18.229]  He's in a whole bunch of movies.
[00:46:18.989 --> 00:46:24.971]  He's going to be simulcasting with us on the webcam live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:46:25.011 --> 00:46:26.432]  He'll come up in about 10 minutes.
[00:46:27.412 --> 00:46:31.153]  Mark Dice, I want to talk about a few other issues with you and play this clip.
[00:46:32.555 --> 00:46:34.136]  We've got one more left here.
[00:46:34.376 --> 00:46:48.081]  We've played Hannity, we haven't played Savage, we haven't played Combs yet, who's actually had me on and not censored me and let me talk about false flag terror a few times, and then I got the word he wasn't really supposed to have me back on anymore because I hadn't been on there in a few years.
[00:46:48.402 --> 00:46:50.682]  But briefly, tell folks about the Resistance Manifesto.
[00:46:50.702 --> 00:46:52.323]  We carry it at InfoWars.com.
[00:46:52.363 --> 00:46:56.365]  On the back cover it says, powerful and compelling, a must read.
[00:46:56.525 --> 00:46:57.125]  Alex Jones.
[00:46:59.426 --> 00:47:13.157]  And it's got other quotes here, but the 9-11 attacks, the Illuminati, Bohemian Grove, Bilderberg Rift, Georgia Guidestones, Skull & Bones, Freemasonry, Cybernetic Organisms, Satanism, Mark of the Beast, The Fellow Reserve, Neural Interfaces, Mind Control Echelon, Killing Machines, Animal-Human Hybrids.
[00:47:13.477 --> 00:47:14.558]  I mean, this is a great book.
[00:47:14.578 --> 00:47:15.358]  It's a thick book.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.662]  You know, 450-something pages or whatever.
[00:47:20.162 --> 00:47:22.324]  You know, 400 and, give the exact page number here.
[00:47:22.344 --> 00:47:23.164]  450 exactly.
[00:47:26.414 --> 00:47:32.139]  This is a great book to give somebody because each chapter is jam-packed, but it's a great and informative read.
[00:47:32.539 --> 00:47:35.942]  And you just read a chapter a night for a few weeks and you'll know quite a bit.
[00:47:35.982 --> 00:47:42.026]  This is something great to give people and I hope they'll go to mfallwars.com and get it, or go to theresistancemanifesto.com and get it.
[00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:50.133]  You know, I try to compile most of the important issues in organizations, in belief systems,
[00:47:50.774 --> 00:48:14.656]  that are involved in creating the new world order and of course there's a chapter in there on 9-11 covering the evidence for that but there is so much I know that a lot of the audience is very well informed I knew that I know there's new people listening every day and so to save yourself just hours and hours of scouring the internet and just kind of reading random quotes that aren't sourced I spent a lot of time and fully sourced the
[00:48:15.464 --> 00:48:24.870]  The quotes that I use, and I own most of these occult books and establishment books, and so a lot of the manifesto isn't just me making allegations.
[00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:40.340]  I'm quoting from insiders like Carol Quigley and covering issues, quoting directly out of the Secret Doctrine, and just kind of put it into a context and into the perspective so that you can understand what it is that's driving the New World Order.
[00:48:40.928 --> 00:49:07.698]  Why they're doing this, what their ultimate plan is going to be, how these secret societies are functioning to secretly pull the strings, the belief systems of these secret societies, and then ultimately how it is that they are satanic, what that means, and how this New Age belief system parallels with Bible prophecy in a way that leads all the way ultimately to
[00:49:08.838 --> 00:49:19.367]  To the Antichrist coming on the scene, which could be hundreds of years from now, it could be thousands of years, but that's ultimately the goal of this, is these new age individuals.
[00:49:19.427 --> 00:49:28.374]  And even if you don't believe in Christianity, the elite believe in a world Christ is going to kill the majority of those that won't take a quote, Luciferian initiation.
[00:49:28.975 --> 00:49:31.917]  This is what the Pentagon at the higher levels teaches, and I know you sourced that.
[00:49:32.358 --> 00:49:34.760]  I mean, you can't make something this crazy up.
[00:49:35.629 --> 00:49:36.130]  No, no.
[00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:46.480]  I mean, they're building this world system, and that's the plan, is to unleash this Illuminati Christ, and the New Age gurus have different ideas as to who it'll be.
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:52.106]  It sort of ties in with the theory of the Holy Bloodline, and from
[00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:55.591]  From the Da Vinci Code, only it's not a bloodline of Jesus.
[00:49:55.671 --> 00:50:08.134]  It's really this, this, uh, Merovingian bloodline that they're keeping so that they can claim when this individual becomes the President of the New World Order, this, this Obama-like figure, uh, that they can claim then that he is divine.
[00:50:08.154 --> 00:50:17.857]  It's from the divine blood that he is the one that's just... Now, we're reporting, even as sociologists, just coldly, and as historians, what they believe.
[00:50:18.297 --> 00:50:20.098]  One minute break, 70 seconds to be technical.
[00:50:21.564 --> 00:50:24.066]  I'm trying to be absolutely precise, training my mind to do that.
[00:50:24.086 --> 00:50:25.167]  70-second break.
[00:50:25.187 --> 00:50:34.575]  We're going to come right back to our guest and then talk about, does he think Obama is a prototype Antichrist individual?
[00:50:34.595 --> 00:50:42.302]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:42.322 --> 00:50:44.083]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:46.581 --> 00:50:48.143]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:48.263 --> 00:50:52.850]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.774]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:55.974 --> 00:50:58.838]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:50:59.018 --> 00:51:03.745]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:03.965 --> 00:51:04.886]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:05.086 --> 00:51:08.028]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:08.328 --> 00:51:15.214]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:51:49.364 --> 00:51:51.265]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:51.745 --> 00:51:54.665]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:05.648 --> 00:52:17.111]  Coming up in about 7-8 minutes, we're going to have Russell Means, the LA Times described as the most famous American Indian since Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, go over a whole host of issues with him.
[00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.272]  Coming up, right now we're talking to Mark Dice.
[00:52:22.252 --> 00:52:24.534]  Doing a great job out there exposing the globalists.
[00:52:24.614 --> 00:52:25.655]  A few minutes on Obama.
[00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:28.077]  I mean, he's gone back on every promise.
[00:52:28.297 --> 00:52:29.978]  He's openly run by the globalists.
[00:52:30.659 --> 00:52:33.421]  He is promising the people he's going to help him on all these bringings of tyranny.
[00:52:34.281 --> 00:52:35.903]  And he does it so sincerely.
[00:52:36.903 --> 00:52:37.123]  Well, it's
[00:53:01.007 --> 00:53:08.311]  Coming crumbling down to some people that have a discerning view, but Obama is the ultimate, you know, anti-Christ figure.
[00:53:08.331 --> 00:53:10.492]  I'm not saying he's the anti-Christ from the Bible.
[00:53:10.552 --> 00:53:17.375]  A more accurate term really is a counterfeit Christ, and not that he's overtly against Christ or against Jesus.
[00:53:17.395 --> 00:53:23.998]  He's a prototype anti-Christ, and there are many anti-Christs, because he comes as a savior when he's a Judas goat and a betrayer.
[00:53:24.018 --> 00:53:24.819]  Go ahead.
[00:53:25.461 --> 00:53:37.205]  Yeah, and you know, you have people at these town hall meetings the other day asking him not to just change policy to help certain issues or segments of society, but they're asking him, can you get me a job?
[00:53:37.285 --> 00:53:38.526]  Can you get me a kitchen?
[00:53:38.973 --> 00:53:39.994]  Can you get my benefits?
[00:53:40.274 --> 00:53:43.636]  And so he's this ultimate counterfeit Christ, similar to Hitler.
[00:53:43.676 --> 00:53:57.224]  Hitler was a counterfeit Christ, Antichrist figure, where to a certain segment of the population he had saved Germany, but then there's this other certain minority group that's preventing him from really helping society.
[00:53:57.264 --> 00:53:59.845]  And so he puts all the blame off onto them.
[00:53:59.885 --> 00:54:01.206]  And so it's going to be very difficult.
[00:54:01.746 --> 00:54:05.929]  People like this audience, we're going to be demonized by the Obama worshipers as
[00:54:06.328 --> 00:54:14.920]  We're the problem, because we didn't go along with the Christ Obama, and we're the reason that the economy continued to collapse.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:21.350]  So, you know, I'm not an expert on the economy, but I do look at the experts at Peter Schiff and at Gerald Cilente.
[00:54:22.563 --> 00:54:28.727]  You know, at the International Forecaster, and what they're saying is happening is really going to be a bad thing.
[00:54:28.747 --> 00:54:35.892]  And you can just look at pretty much the opposite of whatever Obama says is going to happen or he's going to do is what he's going to do.
[00:54:35.952 --> 00:54:41.175]  You know, he says that he's going to save the economy, well, he's going to destroy the economy.
[00:54:41.576 --> 00:54:45.258]  He says during the campaign that he was against illegal wiretapping.
[00:54:45.923 --> 00:54:49.506]  Uh, and then he voted for, uh, immunity for the wiretapping.
[00:54:49.566 --> 00:54:53.468]  So you can pretty much take whatever, uh, whatever they say they're going to do.
[00:54:53.508 --> 00:54:59.593]  And then he says he's going to shut down the torture camps, but it says they'll look at it in a year, but they're going to keep renditions and secret camps.
[00:55:00.994 --> 00:55:01.254]  Yeah.
[00:55:01.634 --> 00:55:06.918]  You know, never before in the history of the United States, maybe even the world, have we had a figure that is so,
[00:55:07.851 --> 00:55:10.894]  So adorized by the media and by the people.
[00:55:10.914 --> 00:55:11.674]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:17.419]  It's that they're positioning him as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Jesus all in one.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:22.904]  Literally transposing his face with famous people just saying, he is God, do what he says.
[00:55:23.224 --> 00:55:29.490]  But all he is, is a wet blanket on the fires of liberty and resistance and rebellion to the New World Order crime syndicate.
[00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:31.992]  He's just meant to stall the people long enough.
[00:55:32.312 --> 00:55:34.254]  When they're done with Obama, they are going to
[00:55:34.674 --> 00:55:36.838]  KRS-One had a fantastic analogy for this.
[00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:52.155]  Use the analogy of a McDonald's or Burger King manager seeming to be the man that's in control, that makes all the decisions.
[00:55:52.195 --> 00:55:53.776]  And that's really what Obama is.
[00:55:53.816 --> 00:55:54.957]  He's just the manager.
[00:55:54.977 --> 00:56:02.983]  He's the figurehead working for the Bilderberg Group, for really ultimately the Illuminati and the globalists.
[00:56:03.263 --> 00:56:04.404]  So he's the man that
[00:56:04.804 --> 00:56:11.694]  That is the picture of the face, the one who makes all the decisions when really he's nothing more than a spokesman.
[00:56:11.714 --> 00:56:17.602]  And I'm sure that most of the population thinks that when he comes out to a public rally and speaks, they think that he's just
[00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:24.754]  Talking just like me and you are talking now just off the top of his head because they don't show the teleprompters on the television very rarely.
[00:56:24.794 --> 00:56:32.481]  They don't show that everywhere he goes it's the exact same speech scripted down to going, oh man, oh, just all the acting, exactly.
[00:56:32.781 --> 00:56:34.603]  Yeah, they don't know that they have these teleprompters out.
[00:56:34.623 --> 00:56:37.166]  There's three teleprompters even when he's publicly speaking.
[00:56:37.206 --> 00:56:39.328]  So he's not speaking, he's reading off the teleprompters.
[00:56:39.966 --> 00:56:44.710]  The Resistance Manifesto, available at Infowars.com and MarkDice.com.
[00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.312]  Hope you'll get the book and spread the word and get it out to folks, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:48.573 --> 00:56:49.814]  Mark Dice, great having you on.
[00:56:50.254 --> 00:56:50.694]  You got it.
[00:56:50.734 --> 00:56:51.355]  Power to the Resistance.
[00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:52.436]  Take care.
[00:56:52.496 --> 00:56:53.416]  Power to the Resistance.
[00:56:53.436 --> 00:56:53.917]  Here we go.
[00:56:53.997 --> 00:56:55.238]  We'll be right back with Russell Means.
[00:56:56.724 --> 00:56:58.985]  Right now the world is a scary place.
[00:56:59.205 --> 00:57:04.409]  It's only a matter of time until we are struck again, but this time with biological and chemical attacks.
[00:57:04.649 --> 00:57:09.031]  The thought is scary, but it's important to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[00:57:09.231 --> 00:57:11.933]  The First Line Defense Kit allows you to do just that.
[00:57:12.113 --> 00:57:21.896]  The first line of defense kit includes Nutri-Immune and Nutri-Defense, providing top biological host defenses against pathogen entry, and provides immune NK killer cell boosting.
[00:57:22.116 --> 00:57:30.618]  Also included, the Nano-Mask Nano-Particular antiviral masks with replacement filters, providing supreme viral protection from airborne pathogens.
[00:57:30.898 --> 00:57:32.519]  And, the first line of defense wipes,
[00:57:32.699 --> 00:57:33.199]  I think so.
[00:57:56.724 --> 00:58:02.986]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:03.366 --> 00:58:05.347]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:06.007 --> 00:58:07.048]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:07.548 --> 00:58:08.068]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:08.348 --> 00:58:09.288]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:09.308 --> 00:58:10.709]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:10.729 --> 00:58:12.389]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:12.709 --> 00:58:19.452]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:19.852 --> 00:58:20.292]  Some U.S.
[00:58:20.352 --> 00:58:25.994]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:26.694 --> 00:58:30.175]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:30.195 --> 00:58:33.176]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:58:56.747 --> 00:59:00.130]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:05.474]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:59:05.674 --> 00:59:10.438]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:59:10.819 --> 00:59:21.948]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:59:22.348 --> 00:59:27.890]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:34.172]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:59:34.372 --> 00:59:35.033]  What about you?
[00:59:35.413 --> 00:59:41.435]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:00:01.419 --> 01:00:02.079]  Big Brother.
[01:00:02.719 --> 01:00:03.780]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.600]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.060]  You want answers?
[01:00:07.841 --> 01:00:08.701]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:13.362]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.582 --> 01:00:15.903]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:17.651]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.312 --> 01:00:23.095]  He really is a man who needs no introduction, Russell Means.
[01:00:25.537 --> 01:00:36.626]  Just an amazing life, and didn't like to talk about himself, but he is what the LA Times calls, described him as the most famous American Indian since Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.
[01:00:37.646 --> 01:00:41.710]  I would say much better known because of all the films and activism and things he's done.
[01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:44.392]  And he joins us, he's been with us four or five times before,
[01:00:44.952 --> 01:00:55.728]  But he now joins us through video cam from the Lakota nation that has pulled out of the treaty that the federal government has broken a trillion times.
[01:00:56.208 --> 01:01:01.075]  He joins us from there, and I have to tell you, he is just so informed on the whole New World Order structure.
[01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:09.262]  So we're going to get his take on now 21 states saying they are going to secede if the feds try martial law or gun confiscation.
[01:01:09.442 --> 01:01:10.282]  That's in the bills.
[01:01:11.143 --> 01:01:14.445]  The Lahota Nation is saying that they're not going along with the tyranny.
[01:01:15.606 --> 01:01:18.128]  They've got the strongest case because the treaty's been violated.
[01:01:19.529 --> 01:01:20.710]  Even stronger than the states.
[01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:22.151]  This is so exciting.
[01:01:22.451 --> 01:01:23.972]  So, Russell Means, great to have you with us.
[01:01:24.913 --> 01:01:26.334]  Great to be with you again, Alex.
[01:01:27.358 --> 01:01:32.919]  I tell you, it's like Buck Rogers getting to have you on the simulcast on TV with us.
[01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:34.859]  It's unbelievable.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.280]  Well, here we are.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:41.361]  You know, there's so much I want to talk about in the 50 minutes we have with you, but you've got the floor.
[01:01:41.401 --> 01:01:42.921]  What would you like to speak about first?
[01:01:42.941 --> 01:01:45.921]  There's so many things I want to get into, but what would you like to speak about first?
[01:01:47.322 --> 01:01:50.082]  Well, first of all, I'd like to speak about liberty and freedom.
[01:01:51.042 --> 01:01:54.883]  Being free is the most important antidote
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.082]  To everything and anything else that's going on.
[01:01:58.422 --> 01:02:00.044]  To any kind of conspiracy.
[01:02:00.404 --> 01:02:01.145]  To everything.
[01:02:01.825 --> 01:02:02.706]  It's being free.
[01:02:03.107 --> 01:02:04.608]  And being free together.
[01:02:05.308 --> 01:02:10.353]  Not being free according to the Constitution of the United States, although that's a pretty good document.
[01:02:10.913 --> 01:02:12.515]  It comes from us, as you know.
[01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:14.116]  Or you should know.
[01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:15.537]  Yes, you're right.
[01:02:15.717 --> 01:02:22.964]  But the most important thing about being free is individual sovereignty.
[01:02:23.749 --> 01:02:27.510]  Individual freedoms and the guarantees thereof.
[01:02:28.071 --> 01:02:31.352]  And the only way you can do that really is through consensus.
[01:02:31.972 --> 01:02:49.658]  Because voting, as you've witnessed how the beautiful idea of freedom the United States of America was born with, has been corrupted because they've turned a republic, an individual freedom, into a democracy which means mob rule.
[01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:54.526]  You know, 50% plus one is mob rule.
[01:02:54.827 --> 01:03:05.082]  And the worst thing about it is that the other 49.9% have to go along with the majority for a certain length of time.
[01:03:05.799 --> 01:03:06.900]  You haven't any options.
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.381]  That's not sovereignty.
[01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:10.322]  That is not being free.
[01:03:10.563 --> 01:03:10.923]  That's right.
[01:03:10.943 --> 01:03:13.185]  Hitler used democracy to set up tyranny.
[01:03:13.705 --> 01:03:16.527]  And 51% said the rest of you are going to be our slaves.
[01:03:16.547 --> 01:03:17.688]  We're going to kill a bunch of you.
[01:03:17.968 --> 01:03:23.532]  In a republic, every person's liberty and freedom is guarded because of the organic rights.
[01:03:23.672 --> 01:03:25.314]  And as the Declaration of Independence states,
[01:03:25.854 --> 01:03:32.398]  That if the government becomes destructive of those aims, it is not our right, it is our duty to throw it off.
[01:03:32.758 --> 01:03:37.261]  And I can think of no other group that has as strong a case to throw it off as Native Americans.
[01:03:38.621 --> 01:03:48.427]  Right, and that's why we unilaterally withdrew from our treaties with the United States of America after over 155 years of violations.
[01:03:48.907 --> 01:03:50.568]  So we finally threw off that yoke.
[01:03:50.628 --> 01:03:53.210]  We're on the brink of extinction ourselves.
[01:03:53.672 --> 01:03:56.613]  And that is the major reason we are now free.
[01:03:57.073 --> 01:03:59.854]  And we're free with non-Indians also.
[01:03:59.914 --> 01:04:11.817]  We are welcoming any and all peoples who want to be free and want to work for freedom in the Republic of Lakota, which is that five-state area in the northern plains.
[01:04:12.417 --> 01:04:18.559]  But there's a thing about America that we must begin to teach the whole scope of this
[01:04:19.997 --> 01:04:22.018]  What is termed now a conspiracy.
[01:04:22.578 --> 01:04:25.820]  Because it began really back in the 1840s.
[01:04:26.681 --> 01:04:31.804]  Less than 75 years after the formation of the United States of America.
[01:04:32.424 --> 01:04:35.566]  When they gave the power of the individual to corporations.
[01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:37.327]  But none of the penalties.
[01:04:37.987 --> 01:04:39.808]  None of the penalties.
[01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:44.831]  Consequently, the corporations began to take off.
[01:04:45.427 --> 01:05:05.030]  But when Congress committed treason in 1871, that's really the watermark of the beginnings of the conspiracy, because the 1871 Act created the corporation which we are now enslaved under, or you are all enslaved under, because we're no longer there.
[01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:13.632]  The 1871 Act was a treasonous act by Congress which established the United States of America as a corporation.
[01:05:14.947 --> 01:05:26.552]  And the Constitution of the United States was established at that time, because previously our Republic was guaranteed by the Constitution for the United States.
[01:05:27.292 --> 01:05:27.953]  Key word there.
[01:05:28.933 --> 01:05:44.320]  Then you go on to 1913 and those other years, the Income Tax Act, the Antitrust Act, and the various other acts that established the Fed and established the Banker's Control.
[01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:50.633]  of our entire nation and its people within and made us slaves.
[01:05:51.033 --> 01:06:00.938]  And then you get to 1933 and off the gold standard, the Social Security National ID number was established.
[01:06:01.358 --> 01:06:08.522]  And then you get into the industrial military complex, which was cemented into place after World War II.
[01:06:09.162 --> 01:06:19.218]  And with the No Such Agency Act of 1948, which was, by the way, the National Security Agency.
[01:06:19.658 --> 01:06:22.002]  If you remember, I can because I'm that old.
[01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:31.797]  I can remember when it was called No Such Agency because to this day no one knows the real power or the scope of that agency or even its budget.
[01:06:32.137 --> 01:06:34.158]  Not even Congress knows its budget.
[01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:35.499]  Sure.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:44.786]  And then you have the subsequent acts and the conspiracies that we've all come to know and abhor right now and what we're living under.
[01:06:45.787 --> 01:06:48.049]  I was just going to interject and have you continue with that timeline.
[01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:50.671]  They've now announced the National Security Council
[01:06:51.690 --> 01:07:01.841]  through the NSA and the rest of it, is openly running the entire government, that the governors in PDD 51, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, serve at the pleasure of the President.
[01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:04.884]  People thought Obama was going to end all this, he's expanding it.
[01:07:05.204 --> 01:07:12.632]  Bush passed the baton, they put in their Judas coat to fool people, and I'd like to get your view on that.
[01:07:13.212 --> 01:07:15.773]  And now they're openly announcing the FEMA camps.
[01:07:15.853 --> 01:07:18.595]  They're openly announcing bills to basically ban guns.
[01:07:19.095 --> 01:07:25.679]  And I mean, you pointed out yourself, they brought in Social Security to domesticate us, to put everybody on the reservation.
[01:07:26.179 --> 01:07:32.242]  You know, how they want us dependent, how they want us domesticated, how they want us institutionalized.
[01:07:32.742 --> 01:07:35.083]  And then they always call that right-wing to say that.
[01:07:35.163 --> 01:07:36.564]  No, it's not right or left.
[01:07:38.405 --> 01:07:53.292]  So I'd like you to speak to that specifically and the dark times we see unfolding right now, but at the same time, the positive things that are happening because resistance is accelerating and people are rediscovering liberty and freedom and finding out they don't have a choice, they're going to have to fight.
[01:07:54.933 --> 01:08:00.236]  You know, back in the 1970s, right here on the Pine Ridge to Indian Reservation, all of a sudden,
[01:08:00.759 --> 01:08:10.244]  For reasons it will never be explained or explainable, I started receiving quarterly reports from the Trilateral Commission in the U.S.
[01:08:10.304 --> 01:08:10.564]  Mail.
[01:08:11.965 --> 01:08:12.185]  Wow!
[01:08:12.225 --> 01:08:18.609]  I don't know how I got it or why and then it lasted for about a year and a half and it disappeared.
[01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:28.694]  But in those quarterly reports, it was phenomenal how they know everything about everything financial in the world.
[01:08:29.851 --> 01:08:43.343]  The IMF and the World Bank, which is the credit agencies for every country, and they had a category called quasi-money.
[01:08:44.804 --> 01:08:47.767]  I've since come to understand what quasi-money is.
[01:08:48.087 --> 01:08:48.768]  It's you and me.
[01:08:49.488 --> 01:08:50.889]  It's our social security number.
[01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:56.975]  It's what enslaves us to all these financial packages, the bankers who are running the
[01:08:58.072 --> 01:08:58.953]  have put together.
[01:08:59.313 --> 01:09:03.015]  But Obama, listen, Obama is the good cop.
[01:09:03.835 --> 01:09:05.456]  They had the bad cop, good cop.
[01:09:05.936 --> 01:09:09.598]  This country now, it's mass psychology to its end.
[01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:15.862]  You know, George Orwell nailed it back in the 1940s with his books.
[01:09:15.922 --> 01:09:24.066]  But the point, now we're in that George Orwellian reality, is the good cop now has made everyone feel,
[01:09:25.993 --> 01:09:32.298]  Now, I was just in Texas, by the way, my friend, and the best-selling down there is those plates.
[01:09:32.338 --> 01:09:33.519]  I couldn't believe it in Texas!
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:38.543]  The plates of Obama with that Jesus Christ pose.
[01:09:38.663 --> 01:09:39.584]  You know, it's like this.
[01:09:40.504 --> 01:09:48.391]  He's looking up, slight smile, the sun is shining on him, and it makes his skin look bronze, or even goldish.
[01:09:49.211 --> 01:09:52.113]  But it's the Jesus Christ pose.
[01:09:52.434 --> 01:09:53.234]  That's what I call it.
[01:09:54.983 --> 01:09:56.083]  That's the way they're treating him.
[01:09:56.143 --> 01:10:01.145]  I talked to some Obama supporters there in Houston and it was unbelievable.
[01:10:01.426 --> 01:10:03.326]  They would not listen to reason.
[01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:09.229]  It's like they've been fed some kind of Obama dope and that they're hooked now.
[01:10:10.029 --> 01:10:16.892]  It's, oh, you know, you bring out facts and figures and they still wouldn't go for it.
[01:10:17.512 --> 01:10:21.413]  I can see exactly what he's done.
[01:10:21.473 --> 01:10:23.054]  It's almost like he's a drone.
[01:10:24.005 --> 01:10:31.467]  That he is some kind of sheeple created especially to pull the cover over.
[01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:34.528]  You know, all his appointments are Zionists.
[01:10:35.909 --> 01:10:36.789]  All his appointments.
[01:10:37.349 --> 01:10:38.750]  I can't name one that isn't.
[01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:50.934]  But the point I'm trying to make is that I believe the United States is part of the client state, not only of the bankers, but we're now a client state of Israel and the Mossad.
[01:10:52.017 --> 01:10:58.039]  It's unbelievable how all the people in key places, you know, are Zionists.
[01:10:58.919 --> 01:11:12.784]  I'm sorry, but the brazen up front, and your previous guest mentioned some of those brazen up front and yourself, of what Obama's doing.
[01:11:13.284 --> 01:11:17.826]  And he blatantly lies to the people, and he's not called down for it.
[01:11:18.961 --> 01:11:19.802]  It's amazing.
[01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:22.243]  Guantanamo, he's not closing it.
[01:11:22.583 --> 01:11:24.885]  He's not withdrawing from Iraq.
[01:11:25.385 --> 01:11:27.786]  He's going to increase war in Afghanistan.
[01:11:27.906 --> 01:11:28.767]  It goes on and on.
[01:11:29.227 --> 01:11:30.748]  Russell, I want you to repeat all that.
[01:11:31.108 --> 01:11:32.569]  In fact, I'm going to skip this break.
[01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:37.052]  We have the music, but I'm going to skip the break for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, the internet stream listeners.
[01:11:37.072 --> 01:11:38.453]  We'll be back for everybody else in four minutes.
[01:11:38.873 --> 01:11:40.874]  But I want to skip this break and continue talking.
[01:11:40.914 --> 01:11:41.735]  We can do that, right guys?
[01:11:42.575 --> 01:11:43.336]  With Russell Means.
[01:11:43.737 --> 01:11:45.660]  Because I don't want to waste any of this time.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.002]  And I love this new video hookup.
[01:11:47.342 --> 01:11:50.828]  And I want to invite him, anytime he's in Texas, to please come in the studio.
[01:11:50.888 --> 01:11:53.031]  We would really be honored to have that.
[01:11:53.111 --> 01:11:53.712]  So stay with us.
[01:11:53.732 --> 01:11:56.015]  We're going to continue, Russell, with Russell Means right now.
[01:11:56.724 --> 01:11:57.285]  Alex Jones.
[01:11:57.825 --> 01:11:58.145]  Okay.
[01:11:58.826 --> 01:11:59.887]  Russell, continuing.
[01:11:59.907 --> 01:12:16.542]  Yeah, I've always tried to stray away, because it's such hot-button issues, to anything that's Protestant, Catholic, Hindu, Native American, because I'm just like, we're all human beings, let's be friends, and the globalists use that to play us off against each other.
[01:12:17.562 --> 01:12:18.002]  Definitely.
[01:12:18.242 --> 01:12:43.452]  But at the same time, when Rahm Emanuel is openly a Mossad operative in the IDF military, and calls himself an Israeli first, he's the chief of staff, and they're in a meeting, this is in the New York Times, they're in a meeting in front of Congress, they call the congressional leaders into both parties, and Rahm's popping his fingers like this, right by Obama, and Obama says, please stop that, Rahm, and Rahm gets up right in his ear and pops his knuckles in his ears,
[01:12:44.552 --> 01:12:55.019]  That is a sign of dominance, and it really is scary to know that special interests, you know, the big banks out of Europe, Israel, all these groups, that we're just a whorehouse.
[01:12:55.059 --> 01:12:55.859]  We're a joke.
[01:12:55.879 --> 01:12:58.681]  We're here to just be completely used and abused.
[01:12:58.701 --> 01:13:06.306]  So I want you to get into that and then start over, because the music interrupted you with how Obama has already betrayed everything in just a month.
[01:13:08.327 --> 01:13:09.568]  Okay, fine.
[01:13:09.588 --> 01:13:10.869]  We're still live, go ahead.
[01:13:12.213 --> 01:13:18.295]  Well, you know, Obama, as I mentioned, he's not closing Guantanamo, maybe in a year.
[01:13:18.315 --> 01:13:28.598]  He's not withdrawing from Iraq because of the situation there and the Iraqi freedom and the voting and the democracy.
[01:13:28.618 --> 01:13:36.981]  I mean, come on, you got the largest embassy in the world, bar none, and it's it's ostentatious, like a palace.
[01:13:37.341 --> 01:13:38.861]  So why are you going to leave?
[01:13:39.201 --> 01:13:41.382]  You're never going to leave Afghanistan.
[01:13:41.698 --> 01:13:43.859]  They're already pouring new troops in there.
[01:13:44.399 --> 01:13:48.681]  And Obama did this on the campaign trail.
[01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:51.382]  He named Pakistan.
[01:13:51.742 --> 01:13:54.443]  He's going in militarily into Pakistan.
[01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:57.764]  That's an Islamic country with the bomb.
[01:13:58.125 --> 01:13:59.865]  So it has to be taken over.
[01:14:00.225 --> 01:14:01.526]  And he will take it over.
[01:14:01.546 --> 01:14:02.466]  He marked my words.
[01:14:03.127 --> 01:14:11.410]  But he is, when I was growing up, the used car salesman was the epitome example
[01:14:12.083 --> 01:14:14.485]  of being slick con man.
[01:14:15.186 --> 01:14:27.155]  Well, this guy, and I heard your previous guest mention about how he is so smooth on going from teleprompter to teleprompter to teleprompter.
[01:14:28.036 --> 01:14:33.060]  And the people don't know it that are watching on TV, but he is trained.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.161]  He's very well trained.
[01:14:37.634 --> 01:14:40.216]  And I think he might even be a clone.
[01:14:42.037 --> 01:14:44.699]  It's not beyond my comprehension.
[01:14:56.587 --> 01:15:10.158]  And you know it's obviously evil and it does all, you see how it was scripted and then it turns out his mother worked for Tim Geithner's dad at a big foundation and is totally globalist and they've been grooming him since he was a kid.
[01:15:10.218 --> 01:15:18.084]  That's now on record and his first job was for Henry Kissinger and so certainly he's been trained since he was a child for this role.
[01:15:19.266 --> 01:15:19.806]  I believe so.
[01:15:20.287 --> 01:15:25.629]  The other thing is, is look how they've now gotten so much control of the world.
[01:15:26.409 --> 01:15:31.332]  China has now announced that they're going to continue buying T-bills.
[01:15:32.872 --> 01:15:35.234]  This country has been so emptied out.
[01:15:36.214 --> 01:15:42.197]  You know, you go to Europe, you go to Germany or the Netherlands or even the British Islands and
[01:15:43.055 --> 01:15:50.300]  They're still manufacturing, they're still making shoes, they're still making clothes, they have a garment industry, etc, etc, etc.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.422]  They have fishing industries.
[01:15:52.442 --> 01:15:53.522]  Where are we at?
[01:15:53.863 --> 01:15:57.145]  Where there's nothing that we can fall back on.
[01:15:57.585 --> 01:16:06.171]  All we have is a bunch of social security slaves that are minimum wage and that they keep knocking it down, knocking it down.
[01:16:06.471 --> 01:16:09.654]  You don't ever hear about the massive
[01:16:10.438 --> 01:16:10.698]  Pardon?
[01:16:11.098 --> 01:16:12.899]  We skipped a break, so we're coming back to the full audience.
[01:16:12.919 --> 01:16:13.739]  We were just on the internet.
[01:16:14.399 --> 01:16:15.319]  Now we're back to the full audience.
[01:16:15.339 --> 01:16:19.240]  Here we go.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:26.042]  You know, I should brief my guests when I do this because it confuses things and it sounds like I'm interrupting Russell Means.
[01:16:26.902 --> 01:16:28.583]  We're on presentplanet.tv.
[01:16:28.983 --> 01:16:30.103]  We're streaming over the web.
[01:16:30.783 --> 01:16:32.404]  Hundreds of thousands are listening on the web.
[01:16:32.904 --> 01:16:36.705]  So I skipped those breaks, but on the AM and FM dial, when I skip a break, Russell,
[01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:40.928]  We then have to come back to the full segment, so I'm sorry I interrupted you there.
[01:16:40.948 --> 01:16:42.129]  I just don't want to waste any time with you.
[01:16:42.449 --> 01:16:56.279]  Please start back over with what you were saying a minute ago about being in Europe compared to the United States and how that ties into what was done to Native Americans, what was done to other Aboriginal groups around the world as a mode of siege, a mode of control.
[01:16:56.299 --> 01:16:59.261]  The globalists admit they've de-industrialized us by design.
[01:16:59.301 --> 01:17:00.041]  Please break it down.
[01:17:01.182 --> 01:17:03.264]  Well, to break it down, it's Indian policy.
[01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:11.470]  The Americans are now the new Indians of the 21st century and the United States is the reservation.
[01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:28.976]  You look, you know, the farmers and the family farmers and family ranchers, the backbone of independence and the backbone of Americanism are the ones that have been systematically destroyed at least since the decade of the 60s.
[01:17:29.536 --> 01:17:32.077]  Now, as America was being emptied out,
[01:17:32.984 --> 01:17:41.973]  Now they turned this, and this is just fact, that in the late fifties they began turning America from a producing, productive country
[01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:52.554]  With a powerful, powerful people called unions that were the biggest threat politically to the hierarchy of the United States of America.
[01:17:52.854 --> 01:17:57.496]  So in 1950, they got Walter Ruther and all them to sell out the unions.
[01:17:57.836 --> 01:17:58.956]  That's not the point though.
[01:17:59.256 --> 01:18:02.498]  The point is they began emptying out America.
[01:18:02.898 --> 01:18:10.821]  Our garment industry, the shoe industry, every industry, the fishing industry, the steel industry, every industry you can think of.
[01:18:11.281 --> 01:18:12.622]  Then they started importing
[01:18:13.399 --> 01:18:22.561]  The Toyotas and those foreign corporations in to further destroy our own industries.
[01:18:23.221 --> 01:18:25.962]  Then having done that, we're empty.
[01:18:27.022 --> 01:18:27.943]  We're slaves now.
[01:18:28.483 --> 01:18:29.783]  Minimum wage slaves.
[01:18:30.403 --> 01:18:33.444]  The middle class has been decimated.
[01:18:34.144 --> 01:18:36.205]  Look, and we're not hearing about it.
[01:18:36.765 --> 01:18:37.785]  We're not hearing about it.
[01:18:37.805 --> 01:18:40.606]  We've got to have some kind of a mass movement.
[01:18:40.666 --> 01:18:41.066]  And Alex,
[01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:43.027]  You're about the only one.
[01:18:43.327 --> 01:18:49.951]  I mean, not the only one, but I know you are one of the most important ones that we can get this mass movement going.
[01:18:50.191 --> 01:19:01.338]  We're doing our thing for freedom here in the Republic of Lakota, but we have to re-instill the idea of responsibility into Americans.
[01:19:01.858 --> 01:19:07.462]  Because once you become an Indian on a reservation, you have no motive.
[01:19:08.197 --> 01:19:13.640]  And the family farmers, the family ranchers, they're almost extinct now because of the credit crunch.
[01:19:14.001 --> 01:19:27.069]  They have been groomed, the family farmers, family ranchers, to run their entire operations on this phony credit operation of the United States, and now they've withdrawn the credit.
[01:19:27.389 --> 01:19:30.811]  So the family farmers, family ranchers, dead in America.
[01:19:30.931 --> 01:19:31.732]  Russell!
[01:19:32.152 --> 01:19:33.633]  Which means America is dead.
[01:19:34.548 --> 01:19:34.988]  I agree.
[01:19:35.068 --> 01:19:44.734]  I mean, my family are farmers and ranchers and they had to go get jobs in the fifties because of the way the government changed everything and took it over.
[01:19:44.814 --> 01:19:49.017]  They all had to work in jobs in town and then work just to not lose their land.
[01:19:49.037 --> 01:19:51.218]  They had to sell off, sell off, sell off more and more.
[01:19:51.538 --> 01:19:56.161]  And now with the Animal ID, the Premises ID, they're written by the big agribusiness.
[01:19:56.241 --> 01:19:58.062]  It openly shuts down farms, ranches.
[01:19:58.362 --> 01:19:59.463]  They're almost gone.
[01:19:59.883 --> 01:20:03.546]  And once you lose that, we have 90% people are urban.
[01:20:04.506 --> 01:20:08.748]  And 10% are rural, but only half of those, or 5% of the population, is self-sufficient.
[01:20:09.208 --> 01:20:13.850]  And we have globalist documents where they state they wanted to do this, and now they've done this.
[01:20:13.890 --> 01:20:20.933]  And I was just down in Mexico a few weeks ago, in Yucatan, and I said, I don't see fishing boats here like I saw last time I was here five years ago.
[01:20:21.274 --> 01:20:23.835]  And they said, no, the government has banned us fishing.
[01:20:24.215 --> 01:20:26.616]  Only the big trawlers from Japan and the U.S.
[01:20:26.636 --> 01:20:27.116]  can come.
[01:20:27.476 --> 01:20:29.237]  And I went to the village and asked.
[01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:30.218]  I said, there's no people here.
[01:20:30.238 --> 01:20:30.778]  And they said, no.
[01:20:31.098 --> 01:20:32.579]  We're not allowed to fish now.
[01:20:32.859 --> 01:20:35.380]  So see, it's the same thing they did to the Native Americans.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:36.780]  Right.
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:42.702]  And it's, it's, you take the means of production away from our people and what do you have left?
[01:20:43.122 --> 01:20:43.743]  You have slaves.
[01:20:44.323 --> 01:20:45.603]  Minimum wage slaves.
[01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:55.147]  Well, they use... And I have mentioned now that China has just announced that they're going to start buying treasury bills again.
[01:20:55.748 --> 01:20:59.090]  Treasury bills are secured by the land of America.
[01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:00.971]  Now already China owns 40%.
[01:21:01.051 --> 01:21:02.793]  Saudi Arabia owns 20% of the T-bills.
[01:21:05.495 --> 01:21:08.716]  So together, they own 60% of the land of America.
[01:21:09.156 --> 01:21:28.084]  Now, however, because America is so broke and running this phony economy, printing this phony money, is that if they wanted to collect on their T-bills right now, America and the dollar would go bust and broke, and we would have to take a wheelbarrow full just to buy a toothpick.
[01:21:28.564 --> 01:21:30.045]  Russell Means, stay there, we got a break.
[01:21:31.204 --> 01:21:34.687]  How are they keeping the indigenous Mayans from fishing?
[01:21:34.887 --> 01:21:35.908]  The environment.
[01:21:36.268 --> 01:21:40.132]  The big bottom trawlers can come and do it, but the natives, they can't fish.
[01:21:41.052 --> 01:21:43.775]  See, that's the phony environmentalism Obama's bringing in.
[01:21:43.795 --> 01:21:45.056]  We'll get Russell Means' take on that.
[01:21:45.356 --> 01:21:45.836]  Stay with us.
[01:21:46.857 --> 01:21:47.758]  We're on the march.
[01:21:48.258 --> 01:21:49.860]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:50.801 --> 01:21:53.463]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:57.583 --> 01:22:01.406]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.

[01:22:12.536 --> 01:22:14.098]  Save big on British chemical suits only $12.
[01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:14.518]  Israeli gas masks $20.
[01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:24.985]  Trigger finger gloves, $5 a pair or $36 a dozen.
[01:22:25.246 --> 01:22:28.387]  Snowshoe binding for $8 or $48 a dozen.
[01:22:28.567 --> 01:22:29.607]  And so much more.
[01:22:29.887 --> 01:22:33.309]  Even hard to find surplus items, all at surplus prices.

[01:23:05.973 --> 01:23:07.014]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:07.535 --> 01:23:08.015]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:09.317]  This is his ammo.
[01:23:09.337 --> 01:23:10.679]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:10.699 --> 01:23:12.341]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:12.681 --> 01:23:19.449]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:19.849 --> 01:23:20.270]  Some U.S.
[01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:25.997]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:26.657 --> 01:23:30.140]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:30.541 --> 01:23:40.409]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:41.390]  Fabled enemies.

[01:23:49.638 --> 01:23:52.981]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:23:57.435 --> 01:23:58.656]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[01:23:58.956 --> 01:24:00.097]  eFoods does it again.
[01:24:00.337 --> 01:24:05.120]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:13.585]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[01:24:14.106 --> 01:24:19.289]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you will understand why families trust eFoods Direct
[01:24:23.027 --> 01:24:23.508]  I think so.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:37.820]  I think so.
[01:25:02.674 --> 01:25:08.057]  Thanks to a listener idea, we've come up with a great new t-shirt where you can maybe deprogram Obamanoids.
[01:25:08.597 --> 01:25:09.738]  It's like the Bush people.
[01:25:09.818 --> 01:25:16.742]  I tried to explain he was New World Order and evil, and they would think I was a communist, and I would say, no, he's a puppet, he's controlled, but they had invested their...
[01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:30.089]  image of themselves, their identity in this person that was developed and created by the very corporate slave state that's destroying all of our futures and openly say they want to euthanize and engage in eugenics.
[01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:32.832]  And if you don't think they'll do it, look what they've done to Native Americans and others.
[01:25:32.872 --> 01:25:34.154]  We had a pastor on last week.
[01:25:34.815 --> 01:25:43.585]  Who exposed, and it's even ended up in mainstream Canadian press after ten years of him fighting, that they take the Native American children in Canada and still, they just kill them!
[01:25:44.026 --> 01:25:50.453]  Half the boys they take, the foster care, they take them, they grab them, they use the churches and it's government control, and they just murder them!
[01:25:51.154 --> 01:25:54.357]  Murder little kids, and it's on record and nobody gets in trouble!
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:55.940]  Nothing happens.
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:57.741]  It's sick, but they want to do it to everybody.
[01:25:58.121 --> 01:25:59.002]  It's any group.
[01:25:59.042 --> 01:26:02.643]  See, with Native Americans, they can sell people they were different, or they're causing a problem.
[01:26:02.683 --> 01:26:04.204]  You know, they're different from us, let's kill them.
[01:26:04.644 --> 01:26:08.686]  But then the killing also happens to those that helped do the killing, or their ancestors.
[01:26:09.006 --> 01:26:09.826]  That's how this works.
[01:26:09.867 --> 01:26:12.628]  But here's the new shirt, and it says,
[01:26:14.801 --> 01:26:22.066]  On the cover here, it says, Worst President Ever, and one half of the face is George Bush, and on the other half it's Obama.
[01:26:22.086 --> 01:26:26.710]  It says, Until Now, InfoWars.com, and on the back it says, Don't Be a Sucker!
[01:26:27.930 --> 01:26:31.314]  And this will explain to everybody and get past the controlled left-right paradigm.
[01:26:31.334 --> 01:26:35.598]  We've got some other new Obama shirts that just went up and pre-orders for the Obama deception just began.
[01:26:35.999 --> 01:26:37.340]  And it's about getting the information out.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:42.346]  It's also about supporting the show so we can have a platform to support other great activists and humanitarians.
[01:26:42.646 --> 01:26:46.551]  And speaking of that, Mr. Means, before we get into other issues and where you think things are going in the future,
[01:26:47.091 --> 01:26:51.675]  Tell us about the Lakota Nation, the four-and-a-half or five-state area.
[01:26:52.055 --> 01:26:52.856]  What has happened?
[01:26:53.196 --> 01:26:54.377]  How people get involved?
[01:26:54.978 --> 01:27:01.103]  This will materialize if people join, if people get involved, if people spread the word, if people financially support.
[01:27:01.403 --> 01:27:04.145]  And I can't think of a better leader than yourself, you know, going through the
[01:27:05.618 --> 01:27:21.857]  situation that you went with the 71 day armed takeover of the uh... sacred grounds of wounded knee with the feds you know all the things you've been through as a leader i'm glad that you're a leading the charge on this so so tell us how the people of not just the united states but the world can be involved in this historic uh...
[01:27:22.338 --> 01:27:22.818]  Oh, it's overdue.
[01:27:22.838 --> 01:27:23.119]  It's overdue.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.761]  And even including ourselves.
[01:27:43.541 --> 01:28:04.948]  But what we recognize in the Republic of Lakota is that 90% of the population in the 60 million acres that makes up this five-state area, a part of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Nebraska, this area is 90% non-Indian, 90% white people.
[01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:11.772]  We understand because for 150 years we've been getting along with them.
[01:28:12.052 --> 01:28:13.393]  We've been living with them.
[01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:14.673]  We have to continue that.
[01:28:15.334 --> 01:28:19.076]  So we invite them to join the Republic of Lakota.
[01:28:19.476 --> 01:28:22.858]  It's just, it's not a racial independent movement.
[01:28:23.258 --> 01:28:25.699]  This is a people's independence movement.
[01:28:26.099 --> 01:28:31.682]  Except we want to do it according to our understanding of individual liberty.
[01:28:32.442 --> 01:28:33.543]  And our understanding
[01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:44.737]  Nevertheless, we want to give state power to neighborhoods so that they have all responsibility for what goes on in their neighborhood.
[01:28:44.997 --> 01:28:46.699]  And I don't care how big the neighborhood is.
[01:28:47.469 --> 01:28:53.593]  And then you have a collection of neighborhoods that make up an area, and then the area, and then finally you get the nation.
[01:28:53.953 --> 01:28:54.373]  That'll be dynamic.
[01:28:54.393 --> 01:29:01.177]  The point is, your point is, if you have a neighborhood of two houses, or twenty houses, or two hundred houses, fine.
[01:29:01.477 --> 01:29:03.939]  But you run everything in that neighborhood.
[01:29:04.759 --> 01:29:05.940]  What does that mean?
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:10.683]  You have to run it by consensus, number one, to ensure individual liberty.
[01:29:11.123 --> 01:29:17.087]  Number two is you have to, you definitely have to bring about
[01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:20.019]  Um, law and order.
[01:29:20.299 --> 01:29:21.560]  That's responsibility.
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:23.120]  Guess what happens then?
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:28.061]  You eliminate the need for police, because in your neighborhood you're taking care of it.
[01:29:28.361 --> 01:29:34.562]  You eliminate the need for courts and judges, and best of all, you eliminate the need for lawyers.
[01:29:36.502 --> 01:29:46.164]  Well, that's the system I've had in Switzerland, some of what was founded here in the United States, and that really is, at least for a lot of the tribes, based on a Native American system.
[01:29:48.038 --> 01:29:55.081]  Yes, that's based upon our control of individual liberty.
[01:29:55.501 --> 01:29:56.361]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:29:56.401 --> 01:30:04.405]  What would you do if, let's say, you're a neighborhood or what you call a village of say 400 houses and somebody commits a murder?
[01:30:06.586 --> 01:30:10.207]  Well, those 400 houses would take care of that.
[01:30:11.485 --> 01:30:14.165]  Not the nation, not the larger area.
[01:30:14.185 --> 01:30:22.447]  Those 400 houses, they would have already determined their justice system, according to them.
[01:30:22.467 --> 01:30:25.988]  You're a mini-state within a state.
[01:30:26.648 --> 01:30:33.209]  It's like posse comitatus laws that used to be prevalent in this United States of America.
[01:30:34.089 --> 01:30:39.990]  Well, that's how small towns were in the United States, was they would have their court, their system, and they would deal out justice.
[01:30:40.933 --> 01:30:52.077]  Well, because Americans have become the new Indians of the 21st century, and they've become actually reservation Indians, because they've abdicated their responsibility.
[01:30:52.398 --> 01:30:59.160]  They've allowed the Congress of the United States of America to eradicate Posse Comitalis laws.
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:05.963]  Listen, these two bedrock avenues of individual liberty is, one,
[01:31:06.587 --> 01:31:14.011]  The sheriff of every county at one time was the top law official in the nation, because they were elected.
[01:31:14.491 --> 01:31:23.576]  And then those sheriffs, any police agency, anywhere, from any place, had to get permission of the sheriff to come in that county.
[01:31:24.217 --> 01:31:28.079]  That was just eradicated in the last three years by Congress.
[01:31:28.579 --> 01:31:32.741]  The other thing is, with the
[01:31:36.195 --> 01:31:37.276]  The corporate laws.
[01:31:37.596 --> 01:31:40.918]  We have to get rid of the rights of corporations.
[01:31:41.818 --> 01:31:52.203]  It's abominable in the height of stupidity to give a corporation a piece of paper the same rights that we have as individuals, but none of the penalties.
[01:31:53.835 --> 01:31:54.755]  This is what we need.
[01:31:54.835 --> 01:31:56.096]  We need to get back.
[01:31:56.236 --> 01:31:58.337]  Imagine if people got into self-sufficiency.
[01:31:58.357 --> 01:32:09.721]  It would create an incredible economy if every little neighborhood together had their own wind power, their own solar panels, put in their own septic tanks, their own systems like the Amish.
[01:32:10.061 --> 01:32:10.681]  Take the Amish.
[01:32:11.261 --> 01:32:12.782]  Almost 300,000 of them in Illinois.
[01:32:12.802 --> 01:32:14.723]  They've done a study over 200,000 of them.
[01:32:15.064 --> 01:32:15.944]  No autism.
[01:32:16.404 --> 01:32:17.725]  Much lower crime rate.
[01:32:17.805 --> 01:32:19.066]  In fact, no crime to speak of.
[01:32:19.086 --> 01:32:23.469]  I mean, they live in harmony because they're living in a natural way.
[01:32:23.789 --> 01:32:26.151]  And the state's coming in and kidnapping their kids now.
[01:32:26.471 --> 01:32:28.452]  The state had left the Amish alone.
[01:32:28.752 --> 01:32:31.574]  Now they're treating them like Native Americans in the 1870s.
[01:32:32.115 --> 01:32:36.858]  I mean, so we, to defend ourselves, we need to go back to being our own little communities.
[01:32:36.878 --> 01:32:38.839]  And if you don't like the neighborhood, the village you're in,
[01:32:39.139 --> 01:32:41.121]  You go find another one you like to move to.
[01:32:41.261 --> 01:32:41.922]  Exactly.
[01:32:42.863 --> 01:32:43.444]  Exactly.
[01:32:43.884 --> 01:32:49.931]  And that's the epitome of individual freedom, is local control.
[01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:55.991]  You know, the jury system used to be the last vestige against state power.
[01:32:56.471 --> 01:33:05.035]  When you had jury nullification, you could nullify an existing law if you felt, the jury felt, it didn't apply to that individual case.
[01:33:05.495 --> 01:33:10.997]  So any law could be nullified by 12 citizens, responsible citizens.
[01:33:11.597 --> 01:33:18.420]  But we've got to re-institute, if we're going to be a free people, we have to re-institute in the minds of our people
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.642]  The idea of responsibility.
[01:33:22.102 --> 01:33:27.886]  It's your responsibility to find out about who really is running this country.
[01:33:28.206 --> 01:33:30.388]  Who really is Obama?
[01:33:30.428 --> 01:33:32.589]  Where did he come from and why?
[01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:43.517]  Why did he move from being a Harvard Law graduate, editor of the Harvard Law Review, he had his pick of any legal
[01:33:44.554 --> 01:33:45.035]  I don't know.
[01:34:03.772 --> 01:34:07.315]  They put him in the most connected church in the black community.
[01:34:07.915 --> 01:34:16.242]  Also, they gave him a political mentor, the local black political boss of the South Side of Chicago.
[01:34:16.842 --> 01:34:19.784]  And there you have his path right to the White House.
[01:34:19.824 --> 01:34:23.347]  In fact, Russell, I mean, there were a lot of cases because I've read a lot of U.S.
[01:34:23.367 --> 01:34:23.687]  history.
[01:34:24.608 --> 01:34:38.714]  I mean, that was classic, that as Western expansion was taking place, that's how they would defeat the Native Americans, is they would go pay off some of the bad chiefs to get them to tell their people to stand down.
[01:34:39.274 --> 01:34:48.459]  And so people can't get that there's a guy who's, you know, part black, that somehow, you know, he, you know, is in a sellout to the New World Order.
[01:34:48.479 --> 01:34:50.019]  I mean, it's asinine.
[01:34:50.439 --> 01:34:52.880]  I mean, look, it's just on its face.
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.621]  And then now,
[01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:55.821]  They're going to continue the secret arrest.
[01:34:56.082 --> 01:34:58.902]  Now they're saying 23 months in Iraq.
[01:34:59.182 --> 01:35:02.203]  It was 6, then 16, now 23.
[01:35:02.343 --> 01:35:03.984]  30,000 more troops, up to 60 in Afghanistan.
[01:35:04.004 --> 01:35:05.264]  Now they're talking about 90,000.
[01:35:05.704 --> 01:35:09.105]  He's talking about going into Iran, going into Pakistan.
[01:35:09.445 --> 01:35:16.567]  They're building FEMA camps and it's in the news and he wants to have a giant 18-24 compulsory service and a new domestic army.
[01:35:17.387 --> 01:35:24.412]  No law, the Pentagon just announced it as a new order, and they're building a camp outside Austin, Russell!
[01:35:24.733 --> 01:35:26.114]  I mean, this is really happening!
[01:35:27.315 --> 01:35:33.780]  Exactly, and it's also, they've gotten rid of the laws protecting us against the National Army.
[01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:44.800]  Now the Department of Defense has jurisdiction, thanks to Homeland Security, has jurisdiction in any legal jurisdiction in the United States of America.
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:48.003]  That never before was possible, but now it is.
[01:35:49.324 --> 01:35:52.808]  The Army can come in for any reason, before it was illegal.
[01:35:53.968 --> 01:35:54.488]  Well, that's right.
[01:35:54.549 --> 01:35:56.851]  First it was 4,000 troops, then 20,000 troops.
[01:35:56.871 --> 01:36:07.480]  Now they're saying, eh, 50,000 troops, NORTHCOM, and the governors are no longer over the National Guard, and the Army Times states, we are preparing to engage the American people.
[01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:13.646]  Is that not high treason and the government breaking its treaty through the Constitution and Bill of Rights with the people?
[01:36:13.806 --> 01:36:16.108]  Because that's a treaty with those colonies.
[01:36:16.148 --> 01:36:16.909]  It's the same thing.
[01:36:17.129 --> 01:36:18.651]  They've completely broken the treaty.
[01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:30.353]  Admitted it themselves, and are saying, according to Time Magazine in this New World Order article, the title is New World Order, zoom in on this folks, it says a foreign global bank will rule the United States now.
[01:36:31.173 --> 01:36:32.633]  I mean, it's incredible!
[01:36:34.294 --> 01:36:38.815]  That was institutionalized in 1913, the banks ruling America.
[01:36:39.295 --> 01:36:46.356]  And we've got to remember, when we went, and I mentioned this earlier, that we were a producing, productive country,
[01:36:46.866 --> 01:36:58.291]  Up until the end of the 50s, 1950s, and then they started their switcheroo to making us consumers and emptying out all the production of America.
[01:36:58.571 --> 01:37:01.432]  They've emptied that out and it took them less than 25 years.
[01:37:01.692 --> 01:37:05.354]  By the mid 80s, we were a consumer nation.
[01:37:05.674 --> 01:37:07.975]  That's why Bush could say, go shopping.
[01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:12.733]  Because that's what this country runs on now, consumerism.
[01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:16.576]  Because they want you dependent on them, just like the Native Americans.
[01:37:17.056 --> 01:37:22.101]  And I know you're the expert on this, but I'm telling the listeners, I'd like you to elaborate, and then tell folks the phone number and websites.
[01:37:22.121 --> 01:37:27.506]  I want to put his website up on screen, guys, so that people can join and get involved or support or learn more.
[01:37:28.795 --> 01:37:44.167]  That they would put people in these areas, they would control them, and you had to then, like welfare, get your food in blankets from the corrupt Indian agents, who would then make the natives for even food when they're starving in the winter, hooker out their women, everything.
[01:37:44.187 --> 01:37:46.389]  I mean, it's just, it's the same thing today!
[01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:49.291]  It is exactly the same thing.
[01:37:49.732 --> 01:37:53.575]  The Indian policies of America, the American Indian policies,
[01:37:54.865 --> 01:37:57.507]  Have more first into their foreign policies.
[01:37:57.947 --> 01:38:00.088]  And now it's on their domestic policies.
[01:38:00.548 --> 01:38:03.109]  So it's just not in the ghettos and the barrios.
[01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:05.371]  It's in middle America.
[01:38:05.391 --> 01:38:06.451]  I mean, hello!
[01:38:07.031 --> 01:38:08.592]  Look at the housing crisis.
[01:38:08.992 --> 01:38:11.374]  That wiped out the middle class.
[01:38:11.994 --> 01:38:20.939]  And now you're going to become paupers and you're going to have to depend on the federal government for them to dole out your food.
[01:38:21.239 --> 01:38:22.659]  For them to dole out.
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:23.480]  And then
[01:38:24.935 --> 01:38:29.978]  All these new diseases that keep coming, how come they're related to things we eat?
[01:38:31.719 --> 01:38:32.660]  Figure that out.
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:34.601]  Just figure that out.
[01:38:34.941 --> 01:38:39.223]  But we've got to be responsible, and we're all responsible for our own freedom.
[01:38:40.304 --> 01:38:43.406]  Not how and what we eat, but our freedom comes first.
[01:38:43.706 --> 01:38:45.567]  Our freedom comes before eating.
[01:38:45.907 --> 01:38:47.708]  Our freedom comes before work.
[01:38:48.068 --> 01:38:51.570]  Our freedom is the most important part of life.
[01:38:52.271 --> 01:38:53.692]  And if you don't know that,
[01:38:54.568 --> 01:38:57.009]  Then you are a sheeple.
[01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:59.031]  Because everything flows out of liberty.
[01:38:59.071 --> 01:39:01.172]  If you don't have the freedom, the liberty, it's over.
[01:39:01.352 --> 01:39:05.875]  But, you know, a lot of everybody, a lot of folks I have on claim, you know, the core is our group.
[01:39:05.995 --> 01:39:07.656]  You know, the core models what happened to us.
[01:39:07.756 --> 01:39:10.338]  You know, people tend to centralize things around themselves.
[01:39:10.378 --> 01:39:11.758]  But I've studied broad history.
[01:39:12.299 --> 01:39:15.421]  And when you say that so much of the modern world system is based
[01:39:16.161 --> 01:39:20.884]  On the experience of the enslavement and extermination of 90 plus percent of Native Americans.
[01:39:20.984 --> 01:39:21.524]  It's true.
[01:39:22.104 --> 01:39:23.385]  I've read the British reports.
[01:39:23.565 --> 01:39:30.229]  I read Hitler's speeches and Mein Kampf and his concentration camps and everything he did.
[01:39:31.329 --> 01:39:32.209]  What he did in Russia.
[01:39:32.530 --> 01:39:35.851]  It was all modeled after what was done to the natives.
[01:39:36.271 --> 01:39:38.972]  And that's been used all over the world.
[01:39:39.492 --> 01:39:40.993]  And it really is the model.
[01:39:41.033 --> 01:39:44.674]  And so that's what we're... Black folks saying, you can't have a man in the house.
[01:39:45.074 --> 01:39:52.577]  The government's going to give you money for your home to put them in an inner city so they can then ship in drugs, put the men in prison, knowing the family would break down.
[01:39:52.997 --> 01:40:00.240]  I've got slave manuals written in the time of Julius Caesar when they would grab Germanic slaves of how they broke up the family, separated the men,
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:02.442]  Put them on reservations to break them down.
[01:40:02.722 --> 01:40:04.324]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[01:40:06.206 --> 01:40:14.334]  One of the hardest things about, and the best things about liberty and being free is you become family oriented.
[01:40:14.354 --> 01:40:16.035]  I'm not talking about blood family.
[01:40:16.095 --> 01:40:20.159]  I'm talking about, now once we become adults we can choose our own family.
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.662]  You know, when we're born we're not
[01:40:23.339 --> 01:40:25.760]  We're not born into our family of choice.
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:29.240]  But when you're being free, you can choose your families.
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:37.002]  And if you look at Europe today, after all their tumultuous history, but they haven't emptied out their countries.
[01:40:37.442 --> 01:40:48.965]  They still make their own shoes, their own clothes, grow their own crops, make their own steel, and have all of the things necessary for a strong, vibrant country by itself.
[01:40:49.747 --> 01:40:54.148]  Let alone joining together in the European Union.
[01:40:54.508 --> 01:40:55.168]  But America?
[01:40:55.928 --> 01:40:56.489]  Emptied out.
[01:40:57.209 --> 01:40:58.249]  America's emptied out.
[01:40:58.529 --> 01:41:01.650]  That is not freedom and that's not responsibility.
[01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:06.531]  Responsibility and freedom are one and the same.
[01:41:06.971 --> 01:41:11.672]  So if you're welcome to the Republic of Lakota, if you're responsible.
[01:41:13.012 --> 01:41:13.612]  Absolutely.
[01:41:13.852 --> 01:41:16.233]  Tell folks the best website to visit and a phone number.
[01:41:17.978 --> 01:41:25.142]  Of course, the republicoflakota.com and russellmeansfreedom.com.
[01:41:25.462 --> 01:41:28.703]  russellmeansfreedom.com, we've got that up on screen right now.
[01:41:29.604 --> 01:41:30.004]  Thank you.
[01:41:31.365 --> 01:41:33.346]  The phone number for the Republic of Lakota is 605-867-1111.
[01:41:33.366 --> 01:41:33.646]  So that's 605-867-1111?
[01:41:46.203 --> 01:41:46.543]  Correct.
[01:41:46.563 --> 01:41:46.603]  605-867-1111.
[01:42:08.581 --> 01:42:13.126]  Well, it's so important that we support every movement for independence and liberty.
[01:42:13.646 --> 01:42:22.055]  The globalists want one huge world with every nation, in their own words, dependent, broken down, de-industrialized, so the globalists can consolidate power.
[01:42:22.075 --> 01:42:23.656]  It's in their own IMF and World Bank documents.
[01:42:23.697 --> 01:42:26.539]  We must do what you're doing and go in the opposite direction.
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:31.144]  It is our only salvation for survival and we've got to do it now.
[01:42:32.285 --> 01:42:41.648]  Russell, I'm going to skip this break as well for the TV viewers and the Infowars.com audio listeners for the AM and FM dial shortwave and the satellite listeners will be back in three short minutes.
[01:42:41.708 --> 01:42:48.391]  And Russell, we've got to have you on for a couple hours coming up in the next month or two so we can take some phone calls and also get
[01:42:49.051 --> 01:42:55.856]  More of your great wisdom, as it's just really great to have you on, and I totally agree with everything you're saying, and I want to support you in any way I can.
[01:42:55.876 --> 01:42:56.797]  I know my listeners do as well.
[01:42:56.897 --> 01:42:59.959]  With food prices soaring to all time highs... John, we're going to skip this break.
[01:43:00.479 --> 01:43:00.940]  Okay, great.
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.681]  We're skipping this one too.
[01:43:03.822 --> 01:43:12.548]  Russell, when we come back to the full audience, and we've got a lot of folks listening and watching right now as well, what are some of the final points you think are most important to make to the viewers and listeners?
[01:43:14.502 --> 01:43:21.344]  Well, as we tell all the people who contact us and they want to move to the Republic of Lakota.
[01:43:22.244 --> 01:43:22.865]  And you're free.
[01:43:23.925 --> 01:43:25.185]  You can buy your own land.
[01:43:27.246 --> 01:43:30.947]  We even have people who are connected with the real estate.
[01:43:32.668 --> 01:43:43.031]  We have to work towards freedom because we're non-threatening, we're non-militant, and we don't believe in any kind of violence whatsoever.
[01:43:43.697 --> 01:43:45.879]  We're willing to work with the existing system.
[01:43:46.259 --> 01:43:52.144]  We've already established our own school, treaty school, just one, but it's going to grow.
[01:43:52.784 --> 01:43:53.945]  Everything's going to grow.
[01:43:54.946 --> 01:44:08.858]  We have a nucleus of people who have moved here and have bought land and other people are in the process of buying land and moving here.
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:14.444]  And what we're going to do is work in our own communities to be self-sufficient.
[01:44:14.724 --> 01:44:18.066]  We live in the Saudi Arabia of wind.
[01:44:18.607 --> 01:44:19.468]  Wind energy.
[01:44:19.948 --> 01:44:24.852]  And the sun shines on the northern plains over 300 days of the year.
[01:44:25.432 --> 01:44:26.713]  So we have that power.
[01:44:27.113 --> 01:44:32.838]  We also have on our land, and it's reachable, is the geothermal water.
[01:44:33.478 --> 01:44:37.201]  So we can hothouse, you know, we can fish farm and we can
[01:44:37.588 --> 01:44:42.614]  Hot house vegetables all year long because of the sun and that possibility.
[01:44:53.348 --> 01:44:59.591]  And as this crisis comes, we need to be there with the solutions so people have an escape valve.
[01:45:00.271 --> 01:45:05.114]  And, you know, I know you've built things and done things and been successful in life, so you know the power of humanity.
[01:45:05.514 --> 01:45:16.219]  And I've been somewhat successful in my life, and that's why I want others out there to have respect for themselves and realize that to dream is destiny, and that action is victory.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.041]  And so that, I mean, even if you just
[01:45:19.801 --> 01:45:22.143]  You move out in the country with your friends and family somewhere else.
[01:45:22.223 --> 01:45:26.286]  The point is, get off the grid, get self-sufficient, join together.
[01:45:26.326 --> 01:45:32.532]  Because true wealth is your friends, your family, your neighbors, your community, and the willingness to stand together and to fight.
[01:45:32.592 --> 01:45:34.994]  Because we're going into a great time of tribulation.
[01:45:35.014 --> 01:45:40.158]  We're going to come back to the full audience, Russell, and I want to ask you one more question about Obama.
[01:45:40.478 --> 01:45:43.521]  To a message to the suckers out there, because it's so painful.
[01:45:44.181 --> 01:45:47.285]  To see them being suckered and to see them falling to this deception.
[01:45:48.006 --> 01:45:53.213]  So I want to talk about that in closing and also give out the website and phone number one more time.
[01:45:53.253 --> 01:45:57.479]  In fact, guys, make sure let's get his website address up on screen, not just the website itself.
[01:45:57.519 --> 01:45:57.800]  Here we go.
[01:46:01.169 --> 01:46:04.711]  Okay folks, it is the final segment with Russell Means, the final segment of the show.
[01:46:04.771 --> 01:46:07.653]  I had a state representative where they're declaring sovereignty in Missouri on today.
[01:46:07.673 --> 01:46:11.435]  I had Mark Dice of the Resistance Manifesto on.
[01:46:12.296 --> 01:46:16.719]  And of course we have Russell Means, just an amazing activist for liberty.
[01:46:17.279 --> 01:46:18.100]  And Freedom.
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:21.862]  He's been mischaracterized in the press quite a bit, but that tells you he's a good guy.
[01:46:21.882 --> 01:46:23.543]  Look at what he actually stands for.
[01:46:23.683 --> 01:46:28.106]  I know that he's a guy from my own heart, and we really appreciate him.
[01:46:28.126 --> 01:46:34.190]  I want to get him on about eugenics and the overall New World Order and what it's like to come from a group that's been so intensely targeted.
[01:46:35.291 --> 01:46:48.044]  By this, but in closing, a message to the Obama people who took their hatred of Bush that was legitimate and transmuted it into love for Obama, not knowing it's the same manager crew behind it.
[01:46:49.625 --> 01:46:50.206]  They think we're
[01:46:50.566 --> 01:46:51.826]  They feel like they're at the table now.
[01:46:51.866 --> 01:46:53.467]  They feel like they've had a great victory.
[01:46:53.887 --> 01:46:57.887]  They don't know they've just been sold a bunch of glass beads and wampum for New York.
[01:46:58.487 --> 01:47:07.309]  They don't understand that this is a cold-blooded setup, but we have studied this and looked at this and lived this, so we know they haven't discovered that yet.
[01:47:07.349 --> 01:47:08.629]  In closing, what do you say to them?
[01:47:10.169 --> 01:47:17.851]  Well, I want to be facetious, actually, and just say goodbye, but the sheeple
[01:47:19.517 --> 01:47:25.880]  The sheeple that are Obama-ites, or however you're going to, they've been Obama-tized.
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:44.449]  Those people, I have found in my visit to Texas, and among my own people, here on the reservation, and to the people who are considered conservative Republicans in the state of South Dakota, no one's listening.
[01:47:45.490 --> 01:47:48.151]  No one wants to take responsibility.
[01:47:49.266 --> 01:47:51.169]  And that's what's happened in this country.
[01:47:51.289 --> 01:47:56.757]  Thomas Jefferson said it best, you know, to be free you have to be responsible.
[01:47:57.738 --> 01:47:58.760]  It goes hand in hand.
[01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:00.062]  I can't say it enough.
[01:48:00.542 --> 01:48:04.749]  And so I'm very skeptical in saying anything
[01:48:05.546 --> 01:48:09.147]  To the people who are the sheeple who have been Obamatized.
[01:48:09.567 --> 01:48:12.108]  Because that's their new savior.
[01:48:12.188 --> 01:48:17.850]  You cannot penetrate their defenses because they refuse to hear it.
[01:48:18.170 --> 01:48:27.973]  I talked common sense and I talked spirituality and I talked facts and figures with these people down in Texas who are Obamatized.
[01:48:28.773 --> 01:48:32.795]  And they wouldn't hear a thing and they felt sorry for me!
[01:48:34.468 --> 01:48:36.510]  They felt sorry for me!
[01:48:38.071 --> 01:48:45.436]  And they told me, you're going to see in 18 months, what we all don't understand here in America, is that it's over.
[01:48:46.477 --> 01:48:53.182]  And if the United States of America just came out and said, well it's over, well there'd be a rising of the people.
[01:48:53.423 --> 01:48:54.163]  They don't want that.
[01:48:54.483 --> 01:49:01.669]  So they're manufacturing, they're printing this money, so that they can let you down easy.
[01:49:02.728 --> 01:49:03.849]  Let you down easily.
[01:49:03.909 --> 01:49:06.250]  And those people over there lost their homes.
[01:49:06.651 --> 01:49:08.492]  And those people over there lost their homes.
[01:49:08.952 --> 01:49:22.901]  And as they let you down easy, and your wages go down, and your livelihood goes down, and your trips become shorter, and you don't buy as much, until the fact is you're going to look around one day,
[01:49:25.794 --> 01:49:29.256]  But they're already committed to him so they won't even admit they were wrong.
[01:49:29.557 --> 01:49:34.819]  Just like people under Stalin or Hitler still wouldn't admit they were conned and wrong because they've invested in it.
[01:49:34.839 --> 01:49:36.620]  They're going to have right-wing groups attacking.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:39.922]  They're going to have Nazis protesting to make him look good.
[01:49:39.942 --> 01:49:41.083]  They're going to play a lot of games.
[01:49:42.384 --> 01:49:43.224]  Oh, definitely.
[01:49:43.544 --> 01:49:46.406]  They are masters at manipulation.
[01:49:46.926 --> 01:49:48.687]  It's an Orwellian reality.
[01:49:50.148 --> 01:49:51.349]  But always remember this.
[01:49:52.628 --> 01:49:54.409]  And this has always rung true.
[01:49:54.469 --> 01:50:00.573]  It only takes 2% of a people to foment a successful revolution.
[01:50:00.833 --> 01:50:02.074]  And we want a revolution.
[01:50:02.354 --> 01:50:04.856]  To return one revolution back to
[01:50:06.055 --> 01:50:08.056]  Freedom of the individual.
[01:50:38.171 --> 01:50:39.397]  Thank you for listening.
[01:50:46.564 --> 01:50:48.105]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:48.245 --> 01:50:52.808]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:52.988 --> 01:50:55.750]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:58.812]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:50:58.992 --> 01:51:02.654]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[01:51:02.794 --> 01:51:04.876]  In any emergency... Back in one minute, Russell.
[01:51:05.096 --> 01:51:08.018]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:08.318 --> 01:51:15.142]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:15.282 --> 01:51:15.642]  I think so.
[01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:50.673]  Okay, Russell, you got cut off by the music there at the end.
[01:51:50.693 --> 01:51:54.096]  We have a substantive audience watching live at PrisonPlanet.tv and listening over the streams.
[01:51:54.676 --> 01:51:59.620]  And frankly, what you've been saying, I think I'm going to take a little bit of a clip of it and put it in a little Obama thing I'm working on.
[01:52:00.041 --> 01:52:06.226]  So I'd like you to repeat that key thing you were saying there at the end that the end of the show cuts you off on, please, sir.
[01:52:07.127 --> 01:52:07.647]  Wait a minute.
[01:52:07.927 --> 01:52:08.548]  What was it?
[01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:12.011]  In the last minute, I forgot.
[01:52:12.051 --> 01:52:13.272]  That was so ad hoc.
[01:52:14.673 --> 01:52:15.634]  No, no, I understand.
[01:52:18.049 --> 01:52:20.194]  Well, I mean, just, it'll pop in your head in a minute.
[01:52:20.214 --> 01:52:26.108]  The point is, they think you're a right-wing extremist, or they think I am, or they think...
[01:52:26.946 --> 01:52:28.827]  They think we're secretly Bush peoples.
[01:52:28.867 --> 01:52:33.010]  I've talked to them that we're trying to horn in on their fun.
[01:52:33.210 --> 01:52:34.451]  And that's what a con artist does.
[01:52:34.471 --> 01:52:36.652]  They make them feel like they're part of it.
[01:52:37.132 --> 01:52:40.074]  And I've had friends and family that have signed on to Ponzi schemes before.
[01:52:40.874 --> 01:52:42.596]  And I've said, look, it's a scam.
[01:52:42.636 --> 01:52:42.956]  Don't do it.
[01:52:42.976 --> 01:52:45.257]  And they go, oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
[01:52:45.297 --> 01:52:47.919]  You're just upset that I've got a good deal going.
[01:52:48.179 --> 01:52:49.940]  And I'm like, no, I've experienced this.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:50.901]  This is a scam.
[01:52:51.961 --> 01:53:05.305]  And they just can't believe it's happening to him and he is total New World Order and like you said, they're like comparing him to Lincoln and George Washington and really putting their full power behind it.
[01:53:05.505 --> 01:53:06.826]  I can say it in another way.
[01:53:08.606 --> 01:53:12.107]  I don't remember exactly what I said, but I knew it was heartfelt.
[01:53:13.288 --> 01:53:13.988]  Sure, no, I understand.
[01:53:14.028 --> 01:53:17.729]  I mean, well, just speak from the heart on, I'm trying to reach out to these people.
[01:53:17.789 --> 01:53:18.830]  I know they're being conned.
[01:53:18.930 --> 01:53:20.030]  Look at what he's already done.
[01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:23.270]  Okay.
[01:53:24.991 --> 01:53:34.493]  You know the biggest thing about Obama and the Obamanization of the people is they are looking for a savior.
[01:53:34.913 --> 01:53:39.474]  But I caution everyone to realize what Einstein said.
[01:53:39.854 --> 01:53:43.595]  Einstein said if you try, his definition of
[01:53:44.628 --> 01:53:54.934]  Insanity is if you can continually try the same thing over and over and over again, but you expect different results.
[01:53:55.975 --> 01:53:59.297]  Every time you try something over again, you expect different results.
[01:53:59.857 --> 01:54:01.538]  That's the Demo-Publicans.
[01:54:01.979 --> 01:54:04.600]  That's what I call the Democrats and the Republicans.
[01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:05.781]  Demo-Publicans.
[01:54:05.861 --> 01:54:07.222]  It's not working.
[01:54:08.237 --> 01:54:15.483]  Our individual liberty has been stripped and if you don't understand that you've got to grab a hold.
[01:54:16.184 --> 01:54:24.191]  Hope is a false word because it keeps you hoping and you're hoping for the next president.
[01:54:24.471 --> 01:54:26.653]  You're hoping for another Obama.
[01:54:26.853 --> 01:54:28.795]  You're hoping for another Roosevelt.
[01:54:28.815 --> 01:54:31.938]  You're hoping for another Lincoln and then they give you a guy
[01:54:33.547 --> 01:54:40.755]  That is supposed to embody Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Obama, and he's the answer to everything.
[01:54:41.496 --> 01:54:43.678]  And all he's doing is printing phony money.
[01:54:43.999 --> 01:54:47.422]  Well, he's not doing it, but the people who control him are doing it.
[01:54:47.643 --> 01:54:49.805]  You've got to take a look at America!
[01:54:53.027 --> 01:55:10.581]  Every time some old woman's begging, saying, I'm homeless now, I need help, I just want a small place with a bathroom, he'll come over and say, oh honey, I'm sorry, but hey, everybody's, everybody's, you know, it's rough, everybody, a lot of people have your problem, and he says, get ready for sacrifice, so the bankers can take everything over.
[01:55:11.121 --> 01:55:15.724]  I mean, this is so dark and so evil, and we have so many resources and so much,
[01:55:16.645 --> 01:55:20.889]  And that he knows he's a puppet, and he knows he's betraying him.
[01:55:21.090 --> 01:55:26.235]  Let me ask you this final question, and we'll plug the number on the website again for folks that missed it, and then let you go, sir.
[01:55:26.275 --> 01:55:29.097]  And I want to invite you in studio any time you're in Texas, here.
[01:55:29.117 --> 01:55:33.862]  And if you're nearby, we'll get you a hotel room, and pay your way to get here, maybe.
[01:55:33.882 --> 01:55:35.083]  That'd be fun to do.
[01:55:36.556 --> 01:55:50.225]  My whole point is this, what is going to happen in two, three, four years when, what you said earlier, they're looking around realizing they were conned, what is going to happen when they realize that they were bamboozled?
[01:55:52.846 --> 01:55:58.010]  The mass psychology that they've perfected.
[01:55:58.786 --> 01:55:59.086]  Yes.
[01:55:59.807 --> 01:56:06.475]  See, they can't tell you that it's all over with now because we would rise up as a people for our freedoms.
[01:56:06.916 --> 01:56:10.100]  So they're going to let you down easy, just like they did to the Indians.
[01:56:10.801 --> 01:56:14.626]  They let you down easy and teach you how to be poor.
[01:56:15.146 --> 01:56:18.629]  And how to accept being poor, and poorer, and poorer.
[01:56:18.849 --> 01:56:30.077]  And pretty soon, you're going to be dependent on the government giving you food, on the government providing you jobs, if their jobs are just few and imp... few, few, few.
[01:56:30.617 --> 01:56:32.698]  So this is dependency.
[01:56:33.599 --> 01:56:35.120]  It's called colonialism.
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:38.682]  It's called Indian reservations.
[01:56:39.123 --> 01:56:40.504]  But America is the reservation.
[01:56:40.584 --> 01:56:44.026]  That's why they're letting in their printing, all this phony money.
[01:56:44.426 --> 01:56:45.887]  Where do you think they're getting this money?
[01:56:46.187 --> 01:56:46.828]  We're tapped out.
[01:56:46.848 --> 01:56:47.949]  It has no value.
[01:56:47.969 --> 01:56:51.191]  They just keep printing it because they have to let you down easy.
[01:56:51.531 --> 01:56:54.433]  Pretty soon, it's going to collapse.
[01:56:54.693 --> 01:57:01.818]  Well, in the bill, in the stimulus bill they've passed and is now in joint committee about to be fully passed,
[01:57:02.774 --> 01:57:11.037]  It actually says that old people will have health care ration because it's natural for them to go blind.
[01:57:11.077 --> 01:57:12.277]  I have it in Bloomberg.
[01:57:12.377 --> 01:57:13.017]  I have the bill.
[01:57:13.057 --> 01:57:16.098]  I couldn't believe it when I saw it in Bloomberg two days ago and I went and looked it up.
[01:57:16.578 --> 01:57:18.159]  It actually says
[01:57:19.059 --> 01:57:20.961]  That they're not going to give people health care.
[01:57:21.001 --> 01:57:22.823]  See, that's what their socialism is.
[01:57:23.224 --> 01:57:24.885]  And then they'll have the young against the old.
[01:57:25.125 --> 01:57:28.929]  And the people that have the government jobs, they're going to defend it and feel like they're part of the winners.
[01:57:29.250 --> 01:57:34.435]  Just like the Indians they had, the Native Americans who sold out, who would be over the other Indians.
[01:57:34.455 --> 01:57:35.897]  I mean, this is a psychology.
[01:57:36.017 --> 01:57:38.239]  Or the house black slave.
[01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:41.483]  Or in Rome, they had the house slaves.
[01:57:42.639 --> 01:57:50.723]  Well, you've already got a health policy based upon how the Indian health policy was developed.
[01:57:51.144 --> 01:57:56.286]  I'm telling you, Indian policy, and I'm saying over it, is now on the backs of Americans.
[01:57:56.747 --> 01:58:02.210]  So yes, you're going to have health care, but it is not going to be very good health care.
[01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:05.571]  And that's just going to be a fact of life.
[01:58:05.811 --> 01:58:09.113]  They're going to give you an aspirin when you come in with a heart seizure.
[01:58:09.734 --> 01:58:12.015]  It happens to us, it's going to happen to you.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:14.361]  Well, they don't just do that.
[01:58:14.461 --> 01:58:26.128]  George Bush, before he went and signed the treaty for the one-child policy in China, for Nixon, he ran the sterilization of Native Americans in the 70s, and they sterilized, what, upwards of 40% the numbers I've seen.
[01:58:26.148 --> 01:58:27.669]  I didn't believe it and looked up the documents.
[01:58:27.689 --> 01:58:28.290]  It was true.
[01:58:29.210 --> 01:58:32.092]  So you're not just going to get bad health care, you're going to get eugenics, aren't you?
[01:58:33.273 --> 01:58:39.197]  Definitely, and this was the whole purpose of classifying our blood quantum.
[01:58:40.475 --> 01:58:48.921]  And that classifies it 1 8th or 1 and they can eliminate parts of your blood by a stroke of the pen.
[01:58:49.642 --> 01:58:59.609]  If your father is from a different area or your mother is from a different area, they won't count her blood and they will mark you down as 1 4th this or 1 8th that or 3 16ths that, 24 30 seconds.
[01:58:59.629 --> 01:59:00.069]  I kid you not.
[01:59:00.089 --> 01:59:01.390]  And that is how eugenics
[01:59:09.343 --> 01:59:11.623]  They're used to control populations.
[01:59:12.124 --> 01:59:13.184]  And why aren't we?
[01:59:13.584 --> 01:59:16.685]  We're at zero, less than zero population growth.
[01:59:18.925 --> 01:59:21.906]  Yeah, how long until Native Americans are extinct?
[01:59:24.646 --> 01:59:27.987]  Well, current trends.
[01:59:28.667 --> 01:59:29.807]  There's two things.
[01:59:30.807 --> 01:59:38.329]  If you don't want to be poor and you want to earn a living, you leave.
[01:59:39.215 --> 01:59:47.297]  And you go out, and you intermarry, and all of a sudden, you've disappeared into the mosaic that is America.
[01:59:47.317 --> 01:59:49.558]  Alright?
[01:59:49.938 --> 01:59:54.219]  But it's in America that's controlled, just like the Indian Reservation has gone.
[01:59:54.239 --> 01:59:56.800]  I'm telling you, the day is here.
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.061]  It's not coming.
[01:59:58.521 --> 02:00:02.942]  The day is here that you are the new Indian of America.
[02:00:04.162 --> 02:00:04.743]  It's fact.
[02:00:04.863 --> 02:00:06.043]  Look around you.
[02:00:07.501 --> 02:00:08.281]  Look around you.
[02:00:09.041 --> 02:00:11.542]  Your quality of life is deteriorating.
[02:00:12.322 --> 02:00:20.563]  Nobody's come up with a study yet on how precipitous that decline is since the housing bubble burst.
[02:00:21.203 --> 02:00:26.224]  But we've had some other bubbles burst up leading to that.
[02:00:26.424 --> 02:00:30.305]  So it's a collective effort, the family farmer and family rancher.
[02:00:30.605 --> 02:00:31.865]  They're on the front lines.
[02:00:31.925 --> 02:00:33.025]  They can tell you.
[02:00:33.786 --> 02:00:36.086]  They're on the front lines of being obliterated.
[02:00:38.021 --> 02:00:38.281]  Wow.
[02:00:38.901 --> 02:00:43.384]  Well, Russell Means, I want to get you back up in the near future, and we really appreciate you joining us.
[02:00:43.424 --> 02:00:52.008]  The phone number for folks to call to get involved or support you is 605-867-1111, 605-867-1111.
[02:00:53.468 --> 02:00:55.809]  And russellmeansfreedom.com.
[02:00:56.290 --> 02:00:57.610]  The site is back up, I see.
[02:00:58.211 --> 02:01:00.692]  And folks can certainly go visit that.
[02:01:00.732 --> 02:01:01.612]  And we salute you.
[02:01:03.473 --> 02:01:08.136]  I wish you a successful mission in all of this, and we look forward to speaking to you again in the near future.
[02:01:09.056 --> 02:01:10.317]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:01:10.917 --> 02:01:11.717]  Thank you, take care.
[02:01:12.798 --> 02:01:14.299]  Okay, folks, there goes Russell Means.
[02:01:14.619 --> 02:01:22.723]  That's it, we're going back into retransmission right now from the first hour of the show, right as the state rep joins us, coming up in about 10 minutes.
[02:01:23.103 --> 02:01:26.405]  Then I'll be back tomorrow live, 11 to 3, and back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:01:26.785 --> 02:01:27.986]  What an amazing broadcast today.
[02:01:28.006 --> 02:01:30.527]  Good job to the crew, and all of you, the listeners, for your support.
[02:01:31.368 --> 02:01:31.728]  Take care.
[02:01:34.997 --> 02:01:35.478]  We're good to go.
[02:01:56.015 --> 02:01:56.095]  Yeah.
