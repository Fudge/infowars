[00:00:04.821 --> 00:00:06.143]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.143 --> 00:00:07.905]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:09.667]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:11.229]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:12.170]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.996]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:21.041]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:26.226]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.148]  It is Thursday, the 20th day of August 2009.
[00:00:28.148 --> 00:00:31.110]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.892]  Coming up in the last hour today, we have Michael.
[00:00:45.384 --> 00:00:47.686]  He's not giving the public his last name.
[00:00:47.686 --> 00:01:13.886]  He is the gentleman with the AR-15 strapped to his back in Phoenix, along with the media reported as many as 14 other open carry citizens pointing out that the Second Amendment is an absolute right to keep and bear arms.
[00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.034]  And really, they're coming out of the closet.
[00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:30.219]  That's what they're doing, because they've literally made gun owners hide in their homes.
[00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.761]  In Texas, most people sneak out with their firearm to go to the shooting range.
[00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:36.382]  Neighbors are greedily watching, wanting to call the police.
[00:01:36.382 --> 00:01:39.464]  The gun's not illegal, but the cops still come.
[00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:43.807]  Even in my own state, how pathetic and castrated we are.
[00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:59.846]  And so what Michael and others are doing all across the country is showing the mindless, dumbed-down, brainwashed public that has turned it into a religious sacrament.
[00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:01.088]  People love their slavery.
[00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:04.271]  It's like it's their possession or something.
[00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:08.875]  That they get so upset when they see a fellow slave, a serf of the New World Order,
[00:02:11.838 --> 00:02:14.120]  Standing up and saying, no, I'm a freeman.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.522]  I'm allowed to keep and bear arms.
[00:02:16.522 --> 00:02:18.623]  I'm not your property.
[00:02:18.623 --> 00:02:34.395]  But when they see the giant police state arming and amassing military force against the people, the Pentagon openly announcing 400,000 combat troops to now be on the streets of America, Governor's Association saying, stop it.
[00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:42.967]  The general public has no idea what's happening, no conception of history or what's going on.
[00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:46.867]  Either people are awake or they're totally unawake.
[00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:48.288]  They're totally asleep.
[00:02:48.288 --> 00:02:49.688]  It's either or.
[00:02:49.688 --> 00:02:51.868]  And there is a massive awakening happening right now.
[00:02:51.868 --> 00:02:54.809]  There's been a huge paradigm shift on multi-levels.
[00:02:54.809 --> 00:03:04.071]  So the establishment is going to move in with staged crises, staged economic collapse, staged terror, staged bioweapon releases, staged wars.
[00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:09.678]  Staged racial conflict and infighting.
[00:03:09.678 --> 00:03:12.120]  It's it's all happening.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.101]  So he'll be joining us.
[00:03:13.101 --> 00:03:22.589]  He hasn't done interviews on Fox and CNN and he's people have asked him to come on but he said no but he will come on this radio show.
[00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:26.693]  Turns out the fella with the other people up there in
[00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:34.078]  New Hampshire with open carry when outside the Obama event or listeners of this show.
[00:03:34.078 --> 00:03:43.162]  Turns out this gentleman, Michael, very intelligent, very well spoken, really laid the points out more succinctly than I would.
[00:03:43.162 --> 00:03:51.345]  I tend to be long-winded when he did talk to the AP live at the event.
[00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:53.906]  He just did a great job and we're really honored to have him coming up.
[00:03:55.452 --> 00:04:00.195]  He's going to be joining us from Ernest Hancock's radio studio ISDN lines.
[00:04:00.195 --> 00:04:04.258]  That should be a good quality connection today.
[00:04:04.258 --> 00:04:06.099]  Looking forward to that.
[00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:13.084]  For 30 minutes we have a filmmaker popping in, Frederick Gretton.
[00:04:13.084 --> 00:04:16.586]  Director of the film Bananas.
[00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:20.669]  Director of the film Bananas that exposes Dole Fruit Company and malicious poisoning
[00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:21.884]  I think?
[00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.653]  All the pesticides, the chemicals, the vaccines.
[00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:49.297]  It's just literally brain-damaging the population.
[00:04:49.297 --> 00:04:53.903]  And that's why people seem so dull, is it's the fluoride and all the rest of it.
[00:04:53.903 --> 00:04:55.665]  We've been chemically lobotomized.
[00:04:55.665 --> 00:04:58.688]  All of us are in a fog.
[00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:05.478]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:05:05.478 --> 00:05:10.004]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:12.287]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:05:12.287 --> 00:05:13.909]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:14.931]  There is a solution.
[00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:23.593]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:05:23.593 --> 00:05:31.055]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:37.097]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[00:05:37.097 --> 00:05:42.658]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[00:06:03.251 --> 00:06:09.275]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:15.180]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.324]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:21.664 --> 00:06:23.626]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:23.626 --> 00:06:26.108]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:37.018]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:40.957]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:40.957 --> 00:06:42.818]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:42.818 --> 00:06:49.725]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:49.725 --> 00:06:57.992]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:57.992 --> 00:06:59.554]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:59.554 --> 00:07:00.755]  The people strike back.
[00:07:02.341 --> 00:07:10.129]  Robert Beatle's new book, Here's What You Do, was written for anyone who wants to survive the upcoming and ongoing financial storm.

[00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:20.741]  He is also trying to help us by running for Congress to stop the thievery and loss of liberties.
[00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:25.663]  Please arm yourself with his guide and go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:25.663 --> 00:07:27.823]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:27.823 --> 00:07:29.664]  Hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:29.664 --> 00:07:32.105]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:32.105 --> 00:07:33.726]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:07:33.726 --> 00:07:38.267]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, inflation?
[00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:40.628]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman.
[00:07:40.868 --> 00:07:44.470]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.831]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:32.154]  Alright, here is what I'm going to do.
[00:08:32.154 --> 00:08:35.476]  I'm just going to open the phones up right now.
[00:08:35.476 --> 00:08:43.420]  Because I got in here this morning with all the stacks of news I've printed off and all the video clips I have and all the points I want to make.
[00:08:45.393 --> 00:08:57.558]  And instead of just starting the show out with a 30 minute, 45 minute hour, hour and 20 minute long rant on three or four issues, I just want to open the phones up for the next hour.
[00:08:57.558 --> 00:09:12.085]  And then when I start the second hour, I will immediately get into the latest healthcare developments, the latest initiatives for the carbon tax, big,
[00:09:13.376 --> 00:09:21.920]  Things happening there with the head of Greenpeace admitting that they lie about the Arctic ice sheets melting.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.381]  Just incredible videos.
[00:09:23.381 --> 00:09:29.965]  And then we have a video from South Texas that unfortunately is something I've seen far too often.
[00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:33.006]  It's up on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube if you want to find it.
[00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:40.070]  I'm getting Kurt and Paul Watson and others to post it on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and maybe write a blurb about it.
[00:09:42.441 --> 00:09:51.988]  In fact, that's going to be our top story when I start the second hour today is my comments on this video.
[00:09:51.988 --> 00:09:59.973]  I'm debating whether I should play it here because the illegal aliens are screaming the N-word over and over again and
[00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:16.671]  And they're sitting there screaming it over and over again.
[00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:24.835]  It's a town hall meeting, and they're there wanting the Obama health care plan because it states they're going to get unlimited free health care.
[00:10:24.835 --> 00:10:27.697]  Of course, illegal aliens already get that, and they know that.
[00:10:27.697 --> 00:10:29.298]  They go to the head of the line.
[00:10:29.298 --> 00:10:34.380]  The cities are mandated by the feds to not refuse care at the emergency room.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.221]  Everybody knows that.
[00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:40.624]  They get free births, free everything, and they're left alone because the establishment doesn't want to scare them away.
[00:10:40.624 --> 00:10:42.145]  They want them here to drive down the wages.
[00:10:42.805 --> 00:10:54.352]  Now, if you're a poor Hispanic American, or a poor Black American, or a poor Anglo American, and you come in and want the free birth, half the time they try to steal your child.
[00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:55.493]  At least here in Austin they do.
[00:10:55.493 --> 00:10:59.376]  I mean, they're there testing your blood, trying to find any marijuana.
[00:10:59.376 --> 00:11:01.597]  They're there asking if you're poor.
[00:11:01.597 --> 00:11:03.038]  They're asking where you're staying.
[00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:07.421]  If you say, oh, I'm staying in my parents' room, they go ahead and steal your kid right there on the spot.
[00:11:08.496 --> 00:11:20.844]  And I've got the Banking Association a few years ago in the AP saying, yeah, we give the illegal aliens houses, even though they don't even have any documents, because we want to make things easier for them here in America.
[00:11:20.844 --> 00:11:35.673]  Well, it's illegal aliens running around with Mexican flags, waving them mariachi bands, coming up laughing and screaming and calling black people the N-word over and over, screaming the N-word at a black cop.
[00:11:38.424 --> 00:11:42.327]  But you know what, it's so horrible and evil, I may just have to, I think I'm gonna go ahead and play it.
[00:11:42.327 --> 00:12:01.825]  I mean, because we also can't have this N-word be like some religious sacrament, where if you say it, it's got so much power, like abracadabra, that everybody goes into cardiac arrest, and then when somebody uses the word, we, you know, can't even play the clip to demonstrate what they're saying and doing.
[00:12:07.472 --> 00:12:12.837]  People need to hear what is being said, what is being done.
[00:12:12.837 --> 00:12:20.765]  But I'll give people fair warning if they don't want their kids hearing it over and over again.
[00:12:20.765 --> 00:12:22.407]  Because they say it over and over again.
[00:12:22.407 --> 00:12:31.836]  I mean, I thought about trying to edit it out, but it would probably take one of my guys hours to capture the video and then edit the pieces out and then upload it again to the web.
[00:12:34.011 --> 00:12:37.114]  In fact, let's contact the folks running this YouTube channel.
[00:12:37.114 --> 00:12:39.195]  I'm familiar with their work.
[00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:42.718]  And let's get them on in the next few days to talk about what they witnessed.
[00:12:42.718 --> 00:12:45.380]  But I mean, the camera says it all.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.903]  The illegal aliens start trying to beat people up.
[00:12:48.903 --> 00:12:52.646]  The police are very, very lenient because they don't want to create any type of scene.
[00:12:55.387 --> 00:13:09.577]  But finally they have to physically restrain, and it's mariachi bands, people with Mexican flags screaming, this is our country, we outnumber you, this is Mexico, we're going to get you.
[00:13:09.577 --> 00:13:19.404]  And what's sad about this is, there's nobody in my experience growing up in Texas more patriotic, people that love liberty, than Hispanic Americans.
[00:13:19.404 --> 00:13:21.085]  They're just salt of the earth great people.
[00:13:26.047 --> 00:13:30.014]  They need to speak out against these illegal aliens that hate this country.
[00:13:30.014 --> 00:13:34.080]  I mean, we just can't sit here and ignore what's going on.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.948]  I mean, I've been out at demonstrations in Austin for the Second Amendment.
[00:13:40.169 --> 00:14:06.729]  or for sovereignty issues and it's been in the newspaper and people show up in Aztec outfits pushing and hitting and starting fights and coming up and grabbing the microphone and we had a Texas Independence Day birthday party at UT and they said you're not allowed to have Texas Independence and they ran up and grabbed the cake and put a bunch of it in their mouth and spit it back out on the cake to ruin it and the police did nothing
[00:14:08.218 --> 00:14:17.869]  And, uh, screaming that I was the racist and I've been to other events where they're wearing these shirts that say, we're going to carry out the plan of San Diego, green and yellow shirts.
[00:14:17.869 --> 00:14:24.217]  And then I had a UT professor who is Hispanic, by the way.
[00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:27.540]  And then separately, somebody else pointed it out to me.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.241]  Go, you know what that plan of San Diego is, Mr. Jones, don't you?
[00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:30.881]  And I said, no.
[00:14:30.881 --> 00:14:33.182]  And he goes, go look it up when you get home.
[00:14:33.182 --> 00:14:33.682]  And I did.
[00:14:33.682 --> 00:14:36.703]  And sure enough, there were all the major university reports about it.
[00:14:36.703 --> 00:14:44.105]  The plan to kill all whites below the age of 16, they just re-educate you.
[00:14:44.105 --> 00:14:45.366]  All Anglos above the age of 16.
[00:14:47.031 --> 00:14:51.473]  And so you'll go to these events and they'll be going, plan of San Diego, plan of San Diego.
[00:14:51.473 --> 00:14:52.373]  We're going to kill you.
[00:14:52.373 --> 00:14:54.574]  We're going to kill you in Spanish.
[00:14:54.574 --> 00:14:57.275]  And then you're just supposed to go, Oh, I love you.
[00:14:57.275 --> 00:15:02.016]  Oh, but see, this is exactly what the new world order wants.
[00:15:02.016 --> 00:15:08.098]  Point is I'm going to, we're going to go live at prison planet.tv in the next hour.
[00:15:08.098 --> 00:15:09.879]  My plane got in late last night.
[00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:12.980]  It was delayed by a couple hours and
[00:15:16.593 --> 00:15:20.635]  So I'm a little bit dingy this morning.
[00:15:20.635 --> 00:15:28.040]  But I've been up for a while, but I just can't get myself to awaken fully, which actually might be a good thing.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.963]  Sometimes people like the subdued show.
[00:15:32.963 --> 00:15:44.029]  Of course, the real reason that I'm really tired is that I never was a heavy drinker, but I quit drinking completely like seven months ago, and I got bored on the airplane last night.
[00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:47.639]  And one drink turned into about five.
[00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:56.141]  And so I have a nice headache to remind me that drinking is not fun.
[00:15:56.141 --> 00:16:00.142]  It was fun while I was doing it, laughing and joking with the two people.
[00:16:00.142 --> 00:16:00.862]  That was another thing.
[00:16:00.862 --> 00:16:11.584]  Usually you're crammed in between, you know, these uptight business travelers who are too busy acting elitist and cool to ever even talk to you on a plane.
[00:16:11.584 --> 00:16:14.225]  But I was in between two friendly, nice people.
[00:16:16.067 --> 00:16:22.070]  Plus, I got such an incredible interview with Jesse Ventura in Los Angeles yesterday.
[00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:31.654]  And I did some other things while I was there that I'm not going to talk about for the next few months, but that's unbelievable.
[00:16:31.654 --> 00:16:35.476]  All the cool things that are going on.
[00:16:35.476 --> 00:16:37.177]  And you know, I'm just being real here, folks.
[00:16:40.802 --> 00:16:45.443]  I'm just sad about it, because I don't want to be in a fight with the illegal aliens.
[00:16:45.443 --> 00:16:47.104]  I don't want to hate these people.
[00:16:47.104 --> 00:16:48.484]  I don't.
[00:16:48.484 --> 00:16:51.605]  But I know they hate me.
[00:16:51.605 --> 00:16:57.746]  And I know the globalists are using them to help break down the wages and balkanize and get us at each other's throats.
[00:16:57.746 --> 00:17:06.829]  And I know that there's conservatively 30 million illegal aliens in this country, and I'd say about half of them are hardcore racists.
[00:17:08.336 --> 00:17:09.657]  Nationalist.
[00:17:09.657 --> 00:17:11.258]  Nationalist isn't a bad thing.
[00:17:11.258 --> 00:17:14.199]  I mean, we... See, we've had our immune system taken away.
[00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:20.342]  We've had our nationalism removed, demonized, gilded, castrated.
[00:17:20.342 --> 00:17:27.266]  And then Mexico is one of the most nationalistic countries in the world.
[00:17:27.266 --> 00:17:30.087]  And they've been oppressed so long.
[00:17:30.087 --> 00:17:33.189]  They're intelligent, smart, hard-working people, but their society is so corrupt.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:39.563]  And they have such an interesting history that there's a lot of anger and pent-up rage, and that's not allowed in Mexico.
[00:17:39.563 --> 00:17:41.344]  They just kill you.
[00:17:41.344 --> 00:17:45.466]  The police drop by, take you out in the field, shoot you in the back of the head.
[00:17:45.466 --> 00:17:47.207]  That's the second time you don't shut up.
[00:17:47.207 --> 00:17:58.113]  The first time they take Tabasco, that's the brand they use, and they pour it down your nose, with you upside down in a chair, and then they shake up a Sprite and shoot up your nose.
[00:17:58.113 --> 00:18:03.716]  Reportedly, it makes Abu Ghraib torture and people being raped with acid nothing.
[00:18:05.362 --> 00:18:10.126]  And then the next time they kill you, they take you out on the field, they get you down, they shoot you in the back of the head.
[00:18:10.126 --> 00:18:20.535]  So see, these people have been, in many cases, bravely fought, even against police with machine guns, mowing them down, just last year again, in several cities.
[00:18:21.314 --> 00:18:39.804]  But see, up here, the foundations, the Ford Foundation, has put more than $40 billion, and they even have more than that in their war chest, but over $40 billion in the last 30 years, since they've really been doing this, with liberation theology.
[00:18:39.804 --> 00:18:45.768]  Liberation theology.
[00:18:45.768 --> 00:18:49.330]  And that basically says, rise up against whitey killing.
[00:18:50.299 --> 00:19:08.329]  Well, the only thing that's happening here is the big egg-headed whiteys know there's only a few of them, so they've got to play groups off against each other, and their main enemy is middle-class America, which is predominantly white.
[00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:13.772]  You have huge groups of Hispanics and blacks, but they've been minorities, so obviously they're not the majority of the middle class.
[00:19:15.981 --> 00:19:21.364]  But you notice the black middle class and Hispanic middle class and Asian middle class, they're out at these tea parties and things.
[00:19:21.364 --> 00:19:22.405]  They know what's happening.
[00:19:22.405 --> 00:19:23.485]  They are educated.
[00:19:23.485 --> 00:19:24.786]  They've got businesses.
[00:19:24.786 --> 00:19:26.127]  They understand what government is.
[00:19:26.127 --> 00:19:33.210]  A parasitic proboscis sucking out all their wealth to offshore banks.
[00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:40.234]  But you see, the big money comes in and funds the poor revolutionary underclass to wage war against the middle class.
[00:19:40.234 --> 00:19:42.916]  It's pressure from above and below and it's in government handbooks.
[00:19:44.454 --> 00:19:46.156]  So I don't know what we do, but you know what?
[00:19:46.156 --> 00:19:52.503]  I just can't stand seeing people with mariachi bands pulling down the American flag and waving the Mexican flag.
[00:19:52.503 --> 00:19:53.865]  I mean, it's a good thing I wasn't then.
[00:19:53.865 --> 00:19:57.029]  Because I can't take much more of this crap, I'm going to tell you right now.
[00:20:00.913 --> 00:20:02.954]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[00:20:02.954 --> 00:20:05.895]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[00:20:05.895 --> 00:20:08.136]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[00:20:08.136 --> 00:20:09.116]  Here's the story.
[00:20:09.116 --> 00:20:13.918]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[00:20:13.918 --> 00:20:15.159]  Now here's the bad news.
[00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:18.440]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands.
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.140]  We're good to go.
[00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:48.864]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[00:20:48.864 --> 00:20:52.966]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[00:20:52.966 --> 00:20:55.747]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:21:02.305 --> 00:21:03.747]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:03.747 --> 00:21:09.814]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:09.814 --> 00:21:10.615]  That's right.
[00:21:10.615 --> 00:21:13.459]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:13.459 --> 00:21:20.407]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:20.948 --> 00:21:29.072]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:29.072 --> 00:21:34.554]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:34.554 --> 00:21:40.377]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:40.377 --> 00:21:44.879]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:44.879 --> 00:21:45.139]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.222]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:50.222 --> 00:21:52.703]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.703 --> 00:21:54.264]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.264 --> 00:22:02.269]  It is a big idea.
[00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:05.070]  A new world order.
[00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:09.973]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:22:09.973 --> 00:22:12.795]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:22:12.795 --> 00:22:14.956]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:22:15.583 --> 00:22:18.746]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:22:18.746 --> 00:22:29.114]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:30.415]  For the first time in history,
[00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:34.533]  The Elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:22:34.533 --> 00:22:38.416]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:40.977]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:22:40.977 --> 00:22:42.158]  Most people have no idea.
[00:22:42.158 --> 00:22:42.939]  They're not after money.
[00:22:42.939 --> 00:22:44.220]  They have all the money they need.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:44.960]  They're after power.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.341]  That's what they're after these years.
[00:22:46.341 --> 00:22:51.104]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:22:51.104 --> 00:22:55.086]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.086 --> 00:22:55.827]  Endgame.
[00:22:55.827 --> 00:22:57.868]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:22:57.868 --> 00:22:59.009]  You have been warned.
[00:22:59.738 --> 00:23:03.541]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:23:03.541 --> 00:23:13.687]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:23:13.687 --> 00:23:20.972]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[00:23:20.972 --> 00:23:26.616]  Doctors who have tried heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results as well.
[00:23:26.616 --> 00:23:29.718]  Here's what Dr. Goodman has to say about his experience with the product.
[00:23:30.018 --> 00:23:35.622]  If you notice that most times here are these drug ads on TV, they have a list of possible side effects.
[00:23:35.622 --> 00:23:42.586]  I find that if you're going to take something that is, you're trading one problem for five or six other problems, that to me doesn't make sense.
[00:23:42.586 --> 00:23:49.070]  Using something that is natural, that is absorbed into the body, particularly because in a liquid form, I think is the best way to go.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:11.005]  Alright, we're going to go to your phone calls and I'm going to cover masses of news in the next hour and continue with calls.
[00:24:11.005 --> 00:24:23.573]  I do want to put the message out to the gentleman in Orlando, Florida and the surrounding county in the town of Claremont.
[00:24:23.573 --> 00:24:28.757]  The state is saying they're probably going to charge him with a felony.
[00:24:28.757 --> 00:24:30.498]  Now remember, Barack Obama
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:38.462]  Was in the Washington Post and he sent condom, he spent a letter, what's the word?
[00:24:38.462 --> 00:24:42.603]  Not the condemnation, but the ones that thank people.
[00:24:42.603 --> 00:24:53.966]  He sent letters thanking people for posting the hope change archetypal image of him during the campaign.
[00:24:53.966 --> 00:24:56.907]  And he said, it looks great on stop signs.
[00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:09.025]  And so what you have is massive, selective enforcement going on here.
[00:25:09.025 --> 00:25:21.030]  And the police admit that when they pulled down the posters that were all over the town of Claremont, and then into surrounding towns and cities and all over Orlando, that more of them were put up, but they don't care.
[00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:27.653]  They found a teenager, and I bet the parents are saying, look son, do what they say, the officers will take care of you.
[00:25:27.653 --> 00:25:29.234]  Yeah, they'll take care of you and put you in prison,
[00:25:31.417 --> 00:25:38.559]  Look, they don't care if $23.7 trillion in our whole future has been stolen by offshore banks in the last 10 months.
[00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:47.623]  They don't care if the Gardasil shot is killing hundreds and hundreds of girls every month and maiming tens of thousands of others.
[00:25:47.623 --> 00:25:56.406]  On record, they don't care if the flu shot is giving people massive brain damage and killing large numbers in the trials!
[00:25:56.406 --> 00:25:58.987]  Sticking people in the ground is fun!
[00:25:58.987 --> 00:25:59.967]  What's upsetting
[00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:09.252]  What upsets the local bureaucrats is somebody daring to thumb their nose at Caesar.
[00:26:09.252 --> 00:26:20.276]  You got all these ninnies going, it's the law, it's the law, we've got to stand up for the law, when they flaunt all the big, serious, hardcore laws.
[00:26:20.276 --> 00:26:27.638]  I mean, Florida's the worst state in the country for CPS, kidnapping children, and then being caught raping them.
[00:26:28.547 --> 00:26:32.008]  Hundreds and hundreds of articles all over Florida news.
[00:26:32.008 --> 00:26:34.528]  Thousands, over 3,500 missing.
[00:26:34.528 --> 00:26:37.369]  Last time I checked, CNN.
[00:26:37.369 --> 00:26:42.530]  A giant pedophile ring runs the family services in Florida on record.
[00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:50.952]  Every time they fire a director, the next director they hire turns out as not just a child porn person, but a child raper!
[00:26:50.952 --> 00:26:54.393]  You got a bunch of child rapists running Florida.
[00:26:54.393 --> 00:26:56.253]  It's a child rape cult!
[00:26:57.537 --> 00:27:01.181]  Because that's what the local drug dealers and CIA money launderers want.
[00:27:01.181 --> 00:27:05.906]  They go, what's the best type of scum to put in charge as long as we let them rape kids?
[00:27:05.906 --> 00:27:10.671]  They don't even want the hundreds of billions we're laundering through this state every year in drug money.
[00:27:10.671 --> 00:27:15.756]  And so basically got a collection of mercenaries, criminals, and pedophiles running Florida.
[00:27:15.756 --> 00:27:19.100]  And boy, they don't like somebody saying no to their God, Barack Obama.
[00:27:21.792 --> 00:27:25.173]  I tell you, what a armpit state.
[00:27:25.173 --> 00:27:34.016]  Again, beautiful state, a lot of good people in it, but because of the drug money and the CIA operating out of there, it's gone to complete hell.
[00:27:34.016 --> 00:27:36.437]  My state's gone to hell as well.
[00:27:36.437 --> 00:27:39.018]  But, I mean, Florida is just a nightmare!
[00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:45.732]  A nightmare of trash and scum and thugs having their way with people.
[00:27:45.732 --> 00:27:52.897]  And I know we get the stories out of Florida, police like the show and go up at things and say, can we have a copy of the Obama deception?
[00:27:52.897 --> 00:27:58.780]  I'm not saying you're all bad, but your leadership has got, you know your state's mafia run.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:05.544]  It's like, just like, I mean, it's even worse than Illinois because Illinois has got a lot of good rural people.
[00:28:05.544 --> 00:28:08.366]  It's just Chicago itself is this bastion of corruption.
[00:28:10.145 --> 00:28:15.348]  But I mean, Florida, especially, the panhandle's not as bad.
[00:28:15.348 --> 00:28:20.532]  But when you get into, it's just, it's disgusting.
[00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:23.394]  I don't know, they got child kidnapping rings running there.
[00:28:23.394 --> 00:28:24.935]  I said I was gonna take your calls.
[00:28:24.935 --> 00:28:28.097]  I just, I just have to tell it like it is.
[00:28:28.097 --> 00:28:32.820]  And I know I've made the establishment very, very angry.
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.202]  They're pulling out all the stops against me, and I just don't even care anymore.
[00:28:37.654 --> 00:28:49.218]  You know what, you people are scum, you've gone over the deep end, off the deep end, and I just reject everything you are and everything you do and everything, you're just scum.
[00:28:49.218 --> 00:28:55.840]  And we've just got to admit to ourselves our government is bankrupt and illegitimate and rogue and run by criminal enterprise.
[00:28:57.458 --> 00:29:06.704]  And the American people better stop infighting with each other and they better get their heads screwed on straight and just say no to the New World Order, no to government, no to all the corruption.
[00:29:06.704 --> 00:29:11.447]  The government's too big, it's out of control, it's grabbing and stealing everything.
[00:29:11.447 --> 00:29:16.411]  It's not enough you've stolen double the GDP in ten months.
[00:29:16.411 --> 00:29:22.755]  It's more than double all the mortgages in the country and five trillion extra.
[00:29:22.755 --> 00:29:24.756]  It's not enough.
[00:29:24.756 --> 00:29:26.938]  You gotta have everything and you gotta have it now.
[00:29:28.376 --> 00:29:31.498]  It's just a bunch of criminals!
[00:29:31.498 --> 00:29:40.024]  And I know a lot of you, you're not going to wake up until you're homeless and living in a FEMA camp, so... Alright, we're going to come back, take your calls, get into all the news.
[00:29:40.024 --> 00:29:44.487]  Just a giant radio show lined up for you today.
[00:29:44.487 --> 00:29:45.148]  Stay with us.
[00:29:45.148 --> 00:29:47.189]  We'll come back to your calls after this break.
[00:29:47.189 --> 00:29:51.152]  Jason, Donna, Cody, Garrett, Stuart, and others.
[00:29:51.152 --> 00:29:52.533]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.533 --> 00:29:55.075]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.075 --> 00:29:57.757]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.384 --> 00:30:04.628]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:30:04.628 --> 00:30:06.630]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:15.159]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:30:15.159 --> 00:30:20.704]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:30:20.704 --> 00:30:22.326]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:30:22.546 --> 00:30:29.070]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[00:31:01.311 --> 00:31:07.115]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:14.720]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:20.884]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.304 --> 00:31:23.266]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.266 --> 00:31:25.768]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:25.768 --> 00:31:37.358]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.358 --> 00:31:39.039]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:40.901]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:47.146]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.786 --> 00:31:56.059]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.059 --> 00:31:57.642]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.642 --> 00:31:58.823]  The people strike back!
[00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:07.591]  If you'd like to replace the ineffective and toxic cleaning products under your sink, you need to visit BioGreenClean.com.

[00:32:14.954 --> 00:32:23.637]  BioGreenClean is tough enough to take on the kitchen, the bathroom, your outdoor grill, and virtually anything in your car, home, boat, or office, yet is safe enough for your children and pets.
[00:32:23.637 --> 00:32:30.460]  BioGreenClean does not contain harmful chemical solvents, such as commonly used chemicals, butoxethanol, petroleum products,
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.260]  We're good to go.
[00:33:02.145 --> 00:33:07.973]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:07.973 --> 00:33:10.276]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:21.901 --> 00:33:23.683]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:33:23.683 --> 00:33:27.706]  I just want to mention, this is the type of stuff in my stack.
[00:33:27.706 --> 00:33:30.428]  Just this issue alone I should spend four hours on.
[00:33:30.428 --> 00:33:34.251]  Government permission will be required to travel.
[00:33:34.251 --> 00:33:39.575]  This is from the Campaign for Liberty, and this is exactly what we've been warning everybody about.
[00:33:39.575 --> 00:33:47.602]  I saw Governor Ridge back in 2002, right as Homeland Security was becoming a cabinet position and taking over all the federal agencies.
[00:33:47.602 --> 00:33:51.085]  He said, to have a job, you're going to have to be in good stead with Homeland Security.
[00:33:52.008 --> 00:33:55.150]  You're gonna have a worker card.
[00:33:55.150 --> 00:34:02.155]  So when you hear about giving the illegal aliens amnesty and a worker visa, that's actually for everybody in North America.
[00:34:02.155 --> 00:34:06.198]  We told you back then they were gonna have a hemispheric travel work card.
[00:34:06.198 --> 00:34:12.042]  That's the new North American hemisphere ID that the feds offer.
[00:34:12.042 --> 00:34:15.785]  And see, you're gonna need that to get on a plane.
[00:34:15.785 --> 00:34:17.466]  That's the real ID card.
[00:34:17.466 --> 00:34:20.488]  Not just the state cards, they're clones of it.
[00:34:22.298 --> 00:34:27.324]  You see, that's the deal with cashless money or cashless systems or digital systems.
[00:34:27.324 --> 00:34:29.307]  You can have multiple forms.
[00:34:29.307 --> 00:34:40.061]  That's what they're talking about, your cell phone being registered to you and with an access code to your GPS triangulation software, that being used as a purchasing system.
[00:34:40.914 --> 00:34:48.897]  Everything is being designed to track and trace and control and monitor and chronicle your entire life's actions, kind of like a book of life.
[00:34:48.897 --> 00:34:55.940]  The New World Order is counterfeiting that, where they're creating an artificial book or record of your life.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:08.405]  I mean, people hundreds of years ago would read about, which archangel is it, you know, supposedly when you go up before God that has the book and everything you've done in it, the book of life and
[00:35:09.059 --> 00:35:10.080]  You know, St.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.521]  Michael, or is it St.
[00:35:11.521 --> 00:35:13.042]  Michael at the Gates?
[00:35:13.042 --> 00:35:16.565]  Flipping through it and everything you've done, here it is, there it is.
[00:35:16.565 --> 00:35:19.128]  Imagine how that sounded to people a thousand years ago.
[00:35:19.128 --> 00:35:20.429]  Sounded pretty wild.
[00:35:20.429 --> 00:35:23.651]  Now, that's what the government's already doing.
[00:35:23.651 --> 00:35:26.594]  But see, they can put what they want in that book.
[00:35:26.594 --> 00:35:29.056]  And there's no judge, there's no jury.
[00:35:29.056 --> 00:35:30.377]  You're guilty, period.
[00:35:30.377 --> 00:35:32.799]  Not guilty until proven innocent.
[00:35:32.799 --> 00:35:36.903]  And there's a million, two hundred thousand Americans on the list, but for a year,
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:42.081]  They haven't been adding the new names publicly.
[00:35:42.081 --> 00:35:50.083]  So it's probably more like 1,300,000 something thousand because they're at 25,000 plus names a month.
[00:35:50.083 --> 00:35:52.063]  So you can do the math there.
[00:35:52.063 --> 00:35:52.943]  It's a lot more than that.
[00:35:52.943 --> 00:35:54.724]  It's probably a million and a half now or so.
[00:35:54.724 --> 00:35:58.545]  But you just show up and they say, sorry, you can't fly.
[00:35:58.545 --> 00:36:02.926]  They never can again.
[00:36:02.926 --> 00:36:03.526]  Think about that.
[00:36:05.956 --> 00:36:07.417]  And there's that intimidation.
[00:36:07.417 --> 00:36:14.462]  Oh, you better not criticize the government or you end up on a no-fly list.
[00:36:14.462 --> 00:36:17.865]  I was talking to Governor Jesse Ventura yesterday.
[00:36:17.865 --> 00:36:21.268]  He was interviewing me for his TV show.
[00:36:21.268 --> 00:36:26.992]  I'm going to be in multiple parts of it and I'm consulting some on it.
[00:36:26.992 --> 00:36:30.615]  And then I interviewed him afterwards.
[00:36:32.267 --> 00:36:33.668]  I'm going to post some of that interview.
[00:36:33.668 --> 00:36:38.673]  More of it is going to come out in time.
[00:36:38.673 --> 00:36:46.141]  He talked about how they flew Daniel Estelin to New York to be interviewed for the show.
[00:36:46.141 --> 00:36:54.429]  And Jesse had to stay in New York an extra day because Estelin was on the no-fly list and had to go through a bunch of hell to get to the United States.
[00:36:55.979 --> 00:36:57.640]  And this is going to be for your jobs.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:01.241]  That's why they're saying you'll be on the no-fly list if you have bad credit.
[00:37:01.241 --> 00:37:04.943]  But that no-fly list then becomes a no-buy list for owning firearms.
[00:37:04.943 --> 00:37:06.844]  That's already been announced by the White House.
[00:37:06.844 --> 00:37:08.385]  And again, I told you this years ago.
[00:37:08.385 --> 00:37:09.625]  Not because I'm smart.
[00:37:09.625 --> 00:37:11.726]  Once you know their game, you understand.
[00:37:11.726 --> 00:37:14.487]  What did Hitler do with Jews?
[00:37:14.487 --> 00:37:15.268]  He said first,
[00:37:16.584 --> 00:37:24.397]  Well, you've just got to wear this star so we know who you are, but it's for your safety because we have special places for you on the trains and special places for you.
[00:37:24.397 --> 00:37:28.023]  And then, oh yeah, you're not allowed to have your business open anymore without authorization.
[00:37:29.574 --> 00:37:31.375]  You're not allowed to travel.
[00:37:31.375 --> 00:37:32.756]  First, you just gotta show your papers.
[00:37:32.756 --> 00:37:34.157]  They get you trained to show your papers.
[00:37:34.157 --> 00:37:36.638]  And then, oh well, we don't let some of you travel.
[00:37:36.638 --> 00:37:38.079]  And then, well, we don't let any of you travel.
[00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:40.040]  And well, now you can't have your business.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.102]  Well, now you can't pay your taxes and you're living in your neighborhood.
[00:37:43.102 --> 00:37:45.384]  We're just gonna make your whole neighborhood a prison.
[00:37:45.384 --> 00:37:47.005]  And then, oh look, you're starving to death.
[00:37:47.005 --> 00:37:50.627]  And then, oh look, we're gonna take you to a camp where you'll be safe.
[00:37:51.892 --> 00:37:53.273]  Since you're homeless now.
[00:37:53.273 --> 00:37:56.556]  That's exactly what FEMA's now announcing with their camps.
[00:37:56.556 --> 00:37:58.158]  This is the new economy.
[00:37:58.158 --> 00:37:59.659]  Oh, you don't have money?
[00:37:59.659 --> 00:38:02.342]  You can just work as a brown shirt for the government.
[00:38:02.342 --> 00:38:06.926]  Or if you're on the wrong side of that, you're going to be somebody in the camp.
[00:38:06.926 --> 00:38:15.514]  And they're going to take you out to mow government lawns, and they're going to take you out to clean elitist houses, and then bus you back and search you before you go back into the camp at night.
[00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:32.653]  Because lazy pot-bellied control freaks need jobs, and their job is going to be beating your skull in with a nightstick and raping your daughter right before they get you in a ditch and blow your head off.
[00:38:32.653 --> 00:38:35.154]  And you're going to love it when they do it, I know.
[00:38:35.154 --> 00:38:40.235]  I know you love drinking the fluoride and love taking the shots and love sucking your thumbs.
[00:38:45.954 --> 00:38:47.415]  Oh, man.
[00:38:47.415 --> 00:38:48.596]  I'm not talking about our listeners.
[00:38:48.596 --> 00:38:52.360]  I'm talking about new listeners, people who think this is all funny.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:58.224]  By the way, coming up next hour, just pull up Battle for the Republic, the extras from Endgame.
[00:38:58.224 --> 00:39:03.008]  I want to show people illegal aliens allowed to demonstrate in Seattle, but if a citizen
[00:39:03.843 --> 00:39:17.309]  Demonstrates in any way, the police come and slam his head in the ground, blood's pouring out, and the police have a celebration with the illegal aliens and give them high fives that they've attacked American citizen and beat him up.
[00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:18.070]  Pulled him out of his car!
[00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:24.133]  And then of course I went and protested Vicente Fox.
[00:39:24.133 --> 00:39:28.695]  Then they had a Cinco de Mayo, what was it, four years ago?
[00:39:28.695 --> 00:39:32.717]  And the leader of the group said, I dare any of the
[00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:38.215]  Anti-immigration people to come out to this event will beat you up.
[00:39:38.215 --> 00:39:39.416]  So I said, well, I'm going to go.
[00:39:39.416 --> 00:39:48.801]  And I was out there with about 25 other people that came out with me and I went right up to the crowd of people and I said, go ahead, attack me.
[00:39:48.801 --> 00:39:54.544]  That happened in this little Texas town we're going to be playing coming up.
[00:39:57.961 --> 00:39:59.723]  And it's just so incredible, folks.
[00:39:59.723 --> 00:40:06.088]  I mean, people with Mexican flags trying to pull down American flags coming up and saying, come on, gringo, let's have a fight.
[00:40:06.088 --> 00:40:06.908]  We outnumber you.
[00:40:06.908 --> 00:40:09.190]  We're going to kick you out of the country.
[00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:14.375]  And then we're just sitting here not supposed to take that as a threat?
[00:40:14.375 --> 00:40:16.516]  And see, I don't want to play into the elite's plan.
[00:40:16.516 --> 00:40:20.199]  I don't want to get into a racial fight.
[00:40:20.199 --> 00:40:25.624]  But when it's coming at you racially, and the media is always going to say you're bad if you stand up for yourself,
[00:40:27.128 --> 00:40:37.011]  The answer is, Americans who want to save our sovereignty and understand the illegal aliens are being used as a tool and a weapon to bring this country down, we have to get together or there's no future.
[00:40:37.011 --> 00:40:46.875]  And we have to get past the tribalism, the racism, and really get scientific about this and realize the mind game the establishment's engaged in, because the elite can't win
[00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:58.167]  If the people get together against the New World Order, but if they play us off against black against white, hispanic against white, old against young, catholic against protestant, muslim against jew, they win.
[00:40:58.167 --> 00:41:01.509]  And you notice that's what COINTELPRO always does when they attack me.
[00:41:03.812 --> 00:41:05.533]  Is they just try to balkanize.
[00:41:05.533 --> 00:41:07.794]  They got people attacking me saying I'm anti-Catholic.
[00:41:07.794 --> 00:41:10.756]  They got people attacking me saying I'm some secret Catholic agent.
[00:41:10.756 --> 00:41:13.137]  They got people attacking me saying I work for Israel.
[00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:15.698]  They got people attacking me saying I'm anti-Semitic.
[00:41:15.698 --> 00:41:23.022]  They got people attacking me on every issue you can imagine, all based on false distortions or disinfo, but it doesn't matter.
[00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:31.407]  It's a background noise of confusion and infighting that we see in the declassified FBI documents in COINTELPRO and Operation Chaos.
[00:41:35.683 --> 00:41:40.006]  And I told you years ago that Hal Turner was an FBI informant.
[00:41:40.006 --> 00:41:43.828]  I mean, you could look at Hal Turner and just his M.O.
[00:41:43.828 --> 00:41:59.638]  and the way he behaved and what he did, and you could look at how he got away with things that nobody else could ever get away with, and how he was always putting out false info on purpose, like other people do.
[00:42:02.658 --> 00:42:05.139]  And it's now come out in federal court.
[00:42:05.139 --> 00:42:08.080]  The FBI admits, well, he wasn't informed, but we're not going to say how much.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:15.102]  And Al Turner's now saying Associated Press that he was a provocateur for the FBI.
[00:42:15.102 --> 00:42:16.462]  Agent provocateur is the word.
[00:42:16.462 --> 00:42:24.105]  Well, I mean, I have stacks of news where every other major Klan rally or meeting or the militia groups that McVeigh was involved in.
[00:42:25.196 --> 00:42:29.698]  I'm not saying militias themselves, the militia groups, the fake ones they create to demonize militias.
[00:42:29.698 --> 00:42:35.401]  Our total feds, I mean I covered that a few days ago, just huge stacks of admissions.
[00:42:35.401 --> 00:42:43.044]  I would say 98% of white supremacist groups are founded and commanded and led by feds.
[00:42:43.044 --> 00:42:45.105]  98%.
[00:42:45.105 --> 00:42:50.887]  And it is sick.
[00:42:50.887 --> 00:42:52.728]  Alright, I said I'm taking your calls, let's do it.
[00:42:52.728 --> 00:42:54.049]  Stuart and Matt, you're on the air.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:57.641]  Good afternoon.
[00:42:57.641 --> 00:42:59.923]  Welcome.
[00:42:59.923 --> 00:43:09.231]  I wanted to highlight a point that you talk about sometimes that I think is pretty crucial in order to have a peaceful revolution.
[00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:19.661]  And I find that, like, a lot of the kids nowadays, like, you know how you talk about how we're about true rebellions, not dressing like dying your hair and having tattoos and piercings.
[00:43:20.447 --> 00:43:25.610]  It's about going down to City Hall and fighting City Hall dressed up nice.
[00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:33.475]  Well, I'm not saying people are bad that have piercings and tattoos and cool hair or whatever, and people always misinterpret what I'm saying.
[00:43:33.475 --> 00:43:44.781]  If people do that to say to the rest of the world that's uptight and in a box, I'm different, and then it's just a manifestation of their own style and art, that's great!
[00:43:44.781 --> 00:43:47.843]  I'm saying that some of the most closed-minded people out there
[00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:56.645]  Are basically people that just get a tattoo or a green mohawk and then just sit back going, man, I'm so cool.
[00:43:56.645 --> 00:44:03.036]  And I'm saying no, it's cool to live a good life, to be strong, to help others and to be involved and informed.
[00:44:03.036 --> 00:44:03.397]  Go ahead.
[00:44:04.471 --> 00:44:22.125]  Yeah, I'm agreeing with you there, but I find that a lot of them are actually, in my neck of the woods up here, are the most receptive, though, because they're already rebellious in some way, a peaceful way, it's just not the right way because they're not informed and they're blindsided by a lot of issues.
[00:44:22.125 --> 00:44:23.366]  I was too when I was younger.
[00:44:23.366 --> 00:44:26.789]  But they're very receptive, you know what I mean?
[00:44:26.789 --> 00:44:30.372]  My only issue with tattoos is they're going to look like hell when you get old.
[00:44:31.724 --> 00:44:32.745]  No, me neither.
[00:44:32.745 --> 00:44:37.266]  I got a couple, but... And I just think that's really important because they're really receptive of this kid.
[00:44:37.266 --> 00:44:37.986]  I know he's a punk.
[00:44:37.986 --> 00:44:40.207]  He's very intelligent, though, you know.
[00:44:40.207 --> 00:44:41.247]  I've talked to him recently.
[00:44:41.247 --> 00:44:41.907]  I ran into him.
[00:44:41.907 --> 00:44:44.368]  I hadn't seen him about a lot of these issues.
[00:44:44.368 --> 00:44:46.489]  And then when he was like, yeah, well, what do you do about it?
[00:44:46.489 --> 00:44:51.310]  I was like, you get dressed up nice and you go down the city hall and you let them know, you know, you pick an issue.
[00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:52.470]  Absolutely.
[00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:53.911]  Good to hear from you.
[00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:54.692]  Good to hear from you.
[00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:56.653]  I appreciate the fine points you've made.
[00:44:56.653 --> 00:45:00.795]  Look, you don't have to be perfectly dressed or have all the answers or even get it all right.
[00:45:20.367 --> 00:45:24.310]  I don't want people to think they've got to be so perfect about this they don't go down to City Hall.
[00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:27.492]  I'm just setting out the best example in my mind.
[00:45:27.492 --> 00:45:29.493]  It doesn't even mean I live up to it.
[00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:30.834]  The main thing is action.
[00:45:30.834 --> 00:45:38.318]  Take action, get involved, down with the New World Order, down with the eugenics cult, down with the One World Government.
[00:45:38.318 --> 00:45:39.359]  That's it.
[00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:41.440]  Just get in there and start swinging.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.963]  And look, I don't, my point is, I don't care what you look like.
[00:45:45.737 --> 00:45:57.502]  I think people in perfectly tailored suits all preening and strutting around and looking down on others that aren't dressed nice, that's a form of dress-up, a form of costume.
[00:45:57.502 --> 00:45:58.923]  But that's what we do as a species.
[00:45:58.923 --> 00:46:06.226]  We're similar to birds, you know, that like our flashy colors and flap their feathers out and wave it at the mate.
[00:46:06.226 --> 00:46:07.706]  That's part of being human.
[00:46:07.706 --> 00:46:12.188]  I'm just saying don't let that become everything you are.
[00:46:12.188 --> 00:46:13.329]  Don't let that become
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.521]  Your entire being.
[00:46:17.521 --> 00:46:26.705]  I totally understand getting a tattoo if you're in the military and, you know, some special campaign or whatever and you get a few tattoos over the years at different rites of passage.
[00:46:26.705 --> 00:46:34.269]  It's like getting an earring when you pass the equator or whatever with sailors.
[00:46:34.269 --> 00:46:35.910]  All of that is very human.
[00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:36.850]  I'm not even judging.
[00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:38.651]  I don't even care.
[00:46:38.651 --> 00:46:41.833]  The point is I don't like being judged by people
[00:46:43.666 --> 00:46:47.108]  Because I have short hair cut and I'm clean cut.
[00:46:47.108 --> 00:46:53.571]  I got short hair because I comb it straight back when it's wet in the morning and it falls like it does and I brush my teeth and that's the end of it.
[00:46:53.571 --> 00:46:55.512]  Put deodorant under my arms.
[00:46:55.512 --> 00:47:00.594]  It takes me three minutes instead of an hour to put up a blue mohawk.
[00:47:00.594 --> 00:47:02.815]  I mean I got stuff to do folks.
[00:47:02.815 --> 00:47:09.919]  I don't have tattoos on my body because I guess growing up I looked at how many old vets and stuff I knew where it was just like these big
[00:47:10.996 --> 00:47:16.898]  Ugly smudges all over them.
[00:47:16.898 --> 00:47:19.178]  Can we go off into side issues?
[00:47:19.178 --> 00:47:22.099]  I just went to a water park last week and I told everybody about that.
[00:47:22.099 --> 00:47:24.639]  I just couldn't believe the number of tattoos.
[00:47:24.639 --> 00:47:27.780]  It was rare to see somebody that didn't have tattoos.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:32.021]  And I mean big ones all over and on their faces.
[00:47:32.021 --> 00:47:37.303]  And I was just like, what are these old people going to look like?
[00:47:37.303 --> 00:47:38.443]  I mean, it's going to look like hell.
[00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:41.538]  And, uh, that's all I'm saying.
[00:47:41.538 --> 00:47:42.159]  I don't care.
[00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:43.540]  Do what you want.
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:47.823]  It's just that... Ah, it doesn't even matter.
[00:47:47.823 --> 00:47:49.584]  They're putting poison in the water supply.
[00:47:49.584 --> 00:47:52.486]  They're spraying chemtrails on us.
[00:47:52.486 --> 00:47:55.408]  And all I'm saying is, we gotta do something, folks.
[00:47:55.408 --> 00:48:06.176]  I mean, it's now coming out, Blackwater, with the Cheney hit teams, rape rooms, and it's just, you just, you just, you just can't believe there's this many bad people.
[00:48:06.176 --> 00:48:08.818]  I just can't believe how evil this country is.
[00:48:12.273 --> 00:48:14.694]  Donna in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:48:14.694 --> 00:48:17.216]  Hi, Alex.
[00:48:17.216 --> 00:48:18.756]  They had a tea party up here.
[00:48:18.756 --> 00:48:20.237]  There's a couple things I want to talk about.
[00:48:20.237 --> 00:48:21.698]  They had a tea party up here.
[00:48:21.698 --> 00:48:24.700]  Over 7,000 people went to it.
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:35.185]  And Raleigh was so blocked up that the people that wanted to go, I don't know what was going on, but anyway, they had it.
[00:48:35.185 --> 00:48:37.967]  I heard it on the radio, and boy, was it exciting.
[00:48:37.967 --> 00:48:40.528]  It was everything that you pretty much cover.
[00:48:41.289 --> 00:48:47.472]  And also, I have a fan that would be good for a t-shirt.
[00:48:47.472 --> 00:48:51.855]  And somebody said this there, and I thought, wow, that was really great.
[00:48:51.855 --> 00:48:59.759]  It was, I wasn't born in a communist country, and I won't die in one, and either will my grandchildren.
[00:48:59.759 --> 00:49:01.640]  What do you think about that?
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.501]  I think it's a great t-shirt.
[00:49:03.501 --> 00:49:07.623]  I wasn't born in a communist country, and I'm not going to die in one.
[00:49:07.623 --> 00:49:09.484]  And either will my grandchildren.
[00:49:11.121 --> 00:49:20.024]  Well, the problem is I'm noticing all over the country that it's the illegal aliens more and more are the army of the government, as we predicted.
[00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:23.785]  I noticed they're making the military up of the illegal aliens and the rest of it.
[00:49:23.785 --> 00:49:30.167]  So, I don't know if you've seen this video out of Trinity, Texas.
[00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:31.508]  And I don't even know if we can play it.
[00:49:31.508 --> 00:49:33.408]  There's so many cuss words.
[00:49:33.408 --> 00:49:37.149]  We're trying to find just a few clips where there aren't cuss words.
[00:49:37.149 --> 00:49:38.710]  But it is illegal aliens.
[00:49:40.493 --> 00:49:49.936]  And I guess citizens as well, coming up and acting like the sight of the American flag is... is hell on earth.
[00:49:49.936 --> 00:49:59.478]  And I guess there's more than 14 South Texas towns that fly the Mexican flag and not the American or Texan.
[00:49:59.478 --> 00:50:00.398]  You know what?
[00:50:00.398 --> 00:50:01.879]  Elson Itza has made national news.
[00:50:01.879 --> 00:50:02.919]  Go ahead.
[00:50:02.919 --> 00:50:03.579]  You know what?
[00:50:03.579 --> 00:50:06.640]  It says in the Bible here you're supposed to warn these
[00:50:07.506 --> 00:50:22.873]  Devil possessed people, they better straighten out and turn from their evil ways, because I believe God is getting pretty fed up with all this child, like you say, you know, they're taking the children away from the parents.
[00:50:22.873 --> 00:50:25.534]  I don't think God's going to put up with it too much.
[00:50:25.534 --> 00:50:33.037]  In Ezekiel 3, it's in 17, you know, it starts at 17, and it says to warn them, because
[00:50:33.783 --> 00:50:38.065]  If we don't warn them, then their blood will be on our hands.
[00:50:38.065 --> 00:50:45.488]  But also, I want you to read Psalms 35 as a protection, like a protection prayer.
[00:50:45.488 --> 00:50:51.671]  And then 109, Psalms 109, and that will be something that I say every night.
[00:50:51.671 --> 00:50:53.211]  God bless you.
[00:50:53.211 --> 00:50:54.172]  Thank you, Donna.
[00:50:54.172 --> 00:50:59.174]  Cody, Gary, Tom, Mookie, and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[00:51:01.653 --> 00:51:07.155]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:51:07.155 --> 00:51:07.955]  and the world.
[00:51:07.955 --> 00:51:11.816]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:51:11.816 --> 00:51:18.319]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest in dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:51:18.319 --> 00:51:20.339]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:51:20.339 --> 00:51:28.282]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:51:28.562 --> 00:51:33.265]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:51:33.265 --> 00:51:39.068]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:51:39.068 --> 00:51:41.249]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:51:41.249 --> 00:51:44.951]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[00:51:44.951 --> 00:51:47.072]  Dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[00:51:53.896 --> 00:52:07.422]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.422 --> 00:52:13.304]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:52:13.304 --> 00:52:19.467]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:19.807 --> 00:52:21.748]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:21.748 --> 00:52:24.230]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:35.158]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:52:37.415 --> 00:52:39.077]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.077 --> 00:52:40.938]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:40.938 --> 00:52:47.865]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.865 --> 00:52:56.132]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.132 --> 00:52:57.694]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.694 --> 00:52:58.895]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:07.936]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[00:53:07.936 --> 00:53:11.879]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[00:53:11.879 --> 00:53:20.205]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[00:53:20.205 --> 00:53:23.107]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[00:53:23.107 --> 00:53:25.889]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[00:53:25.889 --> 00:53:30.072]  Thieves get near you, push a button, and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[00:53:30.472 --> 00:53:30.952]  I think so.
[00:54:01.467 --> 00:54:05.230]  We don't need no education.
[00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:10.693]  We don't need no thought control.
[00:54:10.693 --> 00:54:15.476]  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[00:54:34.608 --> 00:54:37.690]  Continuing with your phone calls.
[00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:46.397]  Coming up at the 8 after, I'm going to do two hours and 52 minutes of this radio show in living color at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:54:46.397 --> 00:54:48.599]  Cody in Washington.
[00:54:48.599 --> 00:54:49.580]  You're on the air, Cody.
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.802]  Welcome.
[00:54:51.802 --> 00:54:52.402]  Oh, yes.
[00:54:52.402 --> 00:54:53.443]  Hello, Alex.
[00:54:53.443 --> 00:54:54.924]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:54:54.924 --> 00:54:56.706]  I've been a listener of yours for years now.
[00:54:57.813 --> 00:55:03.534]  The reason I called is because I heard a conversation that you had with a friend of mine.
[00:55:03.534 --> 00:55:04.975]  He taped it.
[00:55:04.975 --> 00:55:10.736]  And I didn't know that you actually agreed with... Alright, I appreciate your call.
[00:55:10.736 --> 00:55:19.778]  It's just amazing how these people all sit there and are just constantly going after my show.
[00:55:19.778 --> 00:55:22.038]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:55:22.038 --> 00:55:25.419]  The Feds are very, very upset about this radio show right now.
[00:55:26.977 --> 00:55:51.040]  Just like Hal Turner, FBI-trained New Jersey blogger to incite others, a New Jersey blogger facing charges in two states for allegedly making threats against lawmakers and judges, was trained by the FBI on how to be deliberately provocative, his attorney said Tuesday.
[00:55:52.150 --> 00:56:05.657]  Hal Turner worked for the FBI from 2002 to 2007 as an agent provocateur and was taught by the agency what he could say that wouldn't be crossing the line.
[00:56:05.657 --> 00:56:20.684]  Defense attorney Michael, what's this word, O-R-O-Z-C-O, said his job was basically to publish information which would cause other parties to act in a manner
[00:56:21.837 --> 00:56:25.018]  Which would lead to their arrest.
[00:56:25.018 --> 00:56:32.582]  Prosecutors have acknowledged that Turner was an informant who spied on radical right-wing organizations.
[00:56:32.582 --> 00:56:43.827]  But the defense has said Turner was not working for the FBI when he allegedly made threats against Connecticut legislators and wrote that three federal judges in Illinois deserve to die.
[00:56:48.251 --> 00:56:53.233]  But if you compare anything that he said when he was operating, there was no difference.
[00:56:53.233 --> 00:56:54.934]  No difference whatsoever.
[00:56:54.934 --> 00:57:09.341]  Special Agent Ross Rice, a spokesman for the FBI in Chicago, said he would not comment on or even confirm Turner's relationship with the FBI.
[00:57:09.341 --> 00:57:13.243]  So, I've always made it clear on air that I don't support
[00:57:14.591 --> 00:57:20.616]  What Zionism does, the popular Zionism we know as what Israel is, there's some different variants of it.
[00:57:20.616 --> 00:57:36.429]  Any more than I support the Ku Klux Klan, or I support Mecha and Larazza that we were just talking about calling for racial hatred, and racial division and all this, and I believe Israel has a double standard on a lot of issues, and I've made films about it.
[00:57:36.429 --> 00:57:41.754]  But because I'm not a Nazi, the white supremacist groups and people don't like me.
[00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:48.695]  Because I don't hate Jews for being Jews, then I'm bad.
[00:57:48.695 --> 00:57:56.119]  And a lot of these groups in the past say, oh, we're not anti-Semitic, we're just anti-Zionist.
[00:57:56.119 --> 00:58:04.503]  And then they just come right out and say, no, it's Jews we don't like, all Jews are bad, basically.
[00:58:04.503 --> 00:58:13.027]  And I happen to know, and it's come out thousands of times, that most of these groups are run and handled and controlled
[00:58:15.675 --> 00:58:20.198]  by the Feds.
[00:58:20.198 --> 00:58:31.305]  That's exactly what I've been talking about is how we have to stand up against global government and not make it a racial or religious issue or the controllers win.
[00:58:31.305 --> 00:58:36.588]  We'll be right back with more polls.
[00:58:36.588 --> 00:58:39.850]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:44.667 --> 00:58:46.047]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:46.047 --> 00:58:48.048]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:58:48.048 --> 00:58:49.028]  Well, you should.
[00:58:49.028 --> 00:58:53.510]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:54.330]  That's right.

[00:59:04.334 --> 00:59:05.474]  Plus, if you act fast,
[00:59:05.694 --> 00:59:11.678]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:59:11.678 --> 00:59:18.562]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:59:18.562 --> 00:59:24.106]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:59:24.106 --> 00:59:25.567]  This is real.

[00:59:47.736 --> 00:59:50.136]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:50.136 --> 00:59:59.399]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:59.399 --> 00:59:59.999]  Big Brother.
[01:00:00.695 --> 01:00:02.477]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:02.477 --> 01:00:04.218]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:04.218 --> 01:00:05.819]  You want answers?
[01:00:05.819 --> 01:00:06.720]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:11.564]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.564 --> 01:00:15.628]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.668 --> 01:00:32.131]  We are continuing with open phones throughout the radio show today.
[01:00:32.131 --> 01:00:38.195]  Remember the fellow out in Arizona with the AR-15 strapped to his back?
[01:00:38.195 --> 01:00:39.936]  Well, he's going to be on the show.
[01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:42.898]  He's refused to do big mainstream media interviews, but he's a listener.
[01:00:43.818 --> 01:00:51.844]  And contacted us and we're excited about having him on, talking about open carry and why he did it and his political views.
[01:00:51.844 --> 01:00:57.589]  And also, Oberman is now trying to demonize him and tie him into McVeigh.
[01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:59.370]  Yeah, the white supremacist, he's a black guy.
[01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:06.476]  And, you know, militias are white supremacist and all this, which is what the feds want.
[01:01:06.476 --> 01:01:11.620]  They don't want blacks and whites and Hispanics and Asians working together for liberty and freedom and living in peace.
[01:01:13.953 --> 01:01:20.120]  They all want to make it tribal, because if you make it tribal, then the blacks will stay in their group and can be controlled by their racial leaders.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.723]  The Jews will stay in their group and can be controlled by their racial leaders.
[01:01:24.076 --> 01:01:30.780]  The Chinese will be racial, and they'll stay in their racial groups, and then all just Hispanics.
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:35.964]  That's how this thing works, and I said I would get into that at the start of the show, and I am coming up later in the hour.
[01:01:35.964 --> 01:01:49.453]  It's just there's so much cussing on this video from Texas that we've got a few select clips we can play from the YouTube video that's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com of the illegal aliens just going absolutely wild.
[01:01:50.753 --> 01:01:52.374]  Or they may be citizens.
[01:01:52.374 --> 01:01:53.335]  I don't know.
[01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:54.896]  It's really scary.
[01:01:54.896 --> 01:01:58.898]  Really, really scary, this type of balkanization.
[01:01:58.898 --> 01:02:01.319]  This is a town hall meeting.
[01:02:01.319 --> 01:02:08.824]  And all over the country, the pro-Obama people beat you up, they attack you, then the media says you're bad.
[01:02:08.824 --> 01:02:12.686]  But you notice, if somebody's got an AR-15 strapped to their back, you're not going to see these guys doing that.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:17.902]  That's what the Second Amendment's for, to protect us from dangerous mobs.
[01:02:17.902 --> 01:02:23.804]  This isn't like Mexico where we're totally enslaved and the government's the only ones that have the weapons.
[01:02:23.804 --> 01:02:25.585]  Okay, who's up next?
[01:02:25.585 --> 01:02:26.705]  Garrett in Mississippi.
[01:02:26.705 --> 01:02:28.386]  Garrett, you're on the air.
[01:02:28.386 --> 01:02:28.986]  Hello Alex.
[01:02:30.524 --> 01:02:34.967]  Um, if you want, if you don't mind, let's talk about malicious.
[01:02:34.967 --> 01:02:35.868]  Yes.
[01:02:35.868 --> 01:02:42.893]  Um, I've been a member for 10 years since I was in college and talking to you, uh, on the radio, et cetera.
[01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:52.281]  And, uh, with your permission, I'd like to offer some websites for some legitimate, uh, unorganized citizens, malicious that people can reach out to.
[01:02:52.281 --> 01:02:55.263]  That's not, uh, not anything that's fed control.
[01:02:57.233 --> 01:03:01.035]  What, you know they're not fed controlled?
[01:03:01.035 --> 01:03:06.278]  I know these folks, you know, and they do their homework.
[01:03:06.278 --> 01:03:10.441]  And our groups in Mississippi, we do background checks and we have a procedure.
[01:03:10.441 --> 01:03:11.622]  Oh, that sounds good.
[01:03:11.622 --> 01:03:13.222]  What are the groups?
[01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:19.186]  Alright, for Mississippi, folks can reach us at MississippiMilitia.us.
[01:03:19.186 --> 01:03:22.248]  And nationwide, there is an organization, AWORM.org.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:38.491]  Well regulated militia.org is a discussion forum, but there's contacts, you know, I know most of these folks from multi-state meetings and such, and the people that run it, they run a tight ship.
[01:03:38.491 --> 01:03:41.353]  And we're not all bad.
[01:03:41.353 --> 01:03:45.856]  You know, we get folks come out to two meetings and then they make a choice.
[01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:47.578]  If it's good for them, they're good for us.
[01:03:48.513 --> 01:03:58.567]  You know, we've let some folks go, and as far as being white supremacist or whatever, we've got several black folks that are, you know... No, no, I understand that.
[01:03:58.567 --> 01:04:00.550]  See, this is why this gets so confusing.
[01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:04.155]  I can't even be clear, and maybe I'm not a good communicator.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.681]  The militias aren't white supremacist.
[01:04:08.681 --> 01:04:17.243]  The media says white supremacist, and then says the word militia, and then says the word gun owner, and then says the word veteran.
[01:04:17.243 --> 01:04:24.285]  Thus, by starting with the term white supremacist, Tim McVeigh, which is a federal agent that's been proven in federal documents,
[01:04:25.993 --> 01:04:36.916]  Then, by extension, by guilt, by association, they then demonize a militia, then they demonize the Second Amendment, then they demonize the veterans.
[01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:38.937]  That's what the DHS report does.
[01:04:38.937 --> 01:04:41.758]  Yes, I'm not saying militias are bad.
[01:04:41.758 --> 01:04:47.460]  But see, COINTELPRO goes out, distorts what I'm saying, and says, look, Alex is saying the militias are bad.
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.280]  Militias, he doesn't like you.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.481]  That is, I'm saying the opposite.
[01:04:51.481 --> 01:04:53.922]  I'm saying people gotta watch out when they get involved.
[01:04:54.943 --> 01:05:00.147]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:04.171]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:10.096]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:10.096 --> 01:05:14.940]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.061]  Number 3.
[01:05:16.061 --> 01:05:21.689]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:05:21.689 --> 01:05:22.370]  Number 4.
[01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:25.273]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:05:25.273 --> 01:05:28.938]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:28.938 --> 01:05:29.779]  Number 5.
[01:05:29.779 --> 01:05:33.404]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:33.624 --> 01:05:39.347]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:05:39.347 --> 01:05:44.050]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:45.831]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:58.288]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:03.632]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:03.632 --> 01:06:05.674]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:05.674 --> 01:06:10.678]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:10.678 --> 01:06:11.859]  How much do you want?
[01:06:11.859 --> 01:06:12.980]  When do you want it?
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:14.862]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:14.862 --> 01:06:15.943]  When will you need it?
[01:06:15.943 --> 01:06:18.145]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:18.145 --> 01:06:19.486]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:19.486 --> 01:06:20.787]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:21.007 --> 01:06:26.250]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:29.852]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:33.674]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:33.674 --> 01:06:34.895]  How much will you need?
[01:06:34.895 --> 01:06:35.795]  We don't know.
[01:06:35.795 --> 01:06:36.896]  How much do you want?
[01:06:36.896 --> 01:06:37.836]  All you can get.
[01:06:37.836 --> 01:06:38.657]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:38.917 --> 01:06:41.958]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:41.958 --> 01:06:43.739]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:43.739 --> 01:06:44.659]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:56.443 --> 01:07:04.186]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:12.769]  AirAndAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[01:07:12.769 --> 01:07:17.531]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:21.472]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[01:07:21.472 --> 01:07:25.594]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[01:07:25.854 --> 01:07:26.334]  I think so.
[01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:02.378]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:05.200]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.367 --> 01:08:30.250]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:33.272]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:08:33.272 --> 01:08:44.221]  What I'm going to do now is go over some of the most important news that I have here in front of me today, then we'll continue with your phone calls coming up.
[01:08:44.221 --> 01:08:48.405]  We are simulcasting, by the way, at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:08:48.405 --> 01:08:48.705]  Here are
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:59.483]  Just some of the headlines I have here in front of me that need to be covered.
[01:08:59.483 --> 01:09:08.471]  Government permission will be required to travel, and required to own a gun, and required to have a job.
[01:09:08.471 --> 01:09:10.212]  And this is all publicly announced.
[01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:13.595]  This is total siege, total control.
[01:09:13.595 --> 01:09:20.080]  This is so if you don't pay the 70, 80, 90 percent taxes they want, and don't do everything they say, you'll have no life.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.803]  This is the cashless society enslavement system.
[01:09:23.803 --> 01:09:24.444]  This is the
[01:09:27.674 --> 01:09:29.835]  You will buy nor sell without it.
[01:09:29.835 --> 01:09:32.615]  I mean, this is what they're installing and setting up.
[01:09:32.615 --> 01:09:35.916]  And even if you're an atheist out there, you should be against this.
[01:09:35.916 --> 01:09:40.497]  Christians should be against it, but they've been told they're going to be raptured out, so why should they care?
[01:09:40.497 --> 01:09:47.179]  Of course, that's not really in the Bible, but you can't explain that to them.
[01:09:47.179 --> 01:09:50.839]  You know, why stand up for the 50-plus million babies that have been aborted?
[01:09:50.839 --> 01:09:52.840]  Because you're about to be teleported out of here, right?
[01:09:54.229 --> 01:10:04.324]  Just amazing piece of news that Congressman Grassley saying FCC diversity chief may stifle talk radio.
[01:10:04.324 --> 01:10:08.089]  Well yeah, we've had a whole bunch of senators introduce legislation
[01:10:09.281 --> 01:10:13.243]  That says they're going to end free speech on talk radio and the internet.
[01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:18.606]  And the FCC is saying with these new bills, they want FCC control over the internet.
[01:10:18.606 --> 01:10:20.487]  And to license bloggers.
[01:10:20.487 --> 01:10:27.210]  And I have a news story here about a mother arrested for criticizing the police raids in their neighborhood.
[01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:28.531]  Arrested for her blog.
[01:10:28.531 --> 01:10:30.732]  And they say you're not allowed to have free speech.
[01:10:30.732 --> 01:10:31.653]  That's in America.
[01:10:31.653 --> 01:10:38.056]  I've got that here in the stack as well.
[01:10:41.451 --> 01:10:47.497]  Also, Barack Obama critics are taking aim now at the carbon reforms.
[01:10:47.497 --> 01:10:48.859]  That's also here in the news.
[01:10:48.859 --> 01:10:54.645]  So you notice people are learning they have political power if they'll just take action.
[01:10:54.645 --> 01:10:59.049]  Now they're going after the rest of the big globalist agenda.
[01:10:59.049 --> 01:11:00.110]  That's very, very exciting.
[01:11:00.831 --> 01:11:10.233]  Inspired by the success of protests against health care reform, the critics began their fight against the carbon scheme with a rally in Houston, Texas.
[01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:26.996]  Several right-wing groups oppose what they see as Mr. Obama's tendency towards big government are involved in both campaigns and hope to defeat or emasculate the two central pillars of the president's domestic agenda.
[01:11:26.996 --> 01:11:29.737]  So we're going to be going over that report.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:41.065]  Also, I have this another Fox News story that links to Infowars.com.
[01:11:41.065 --> 01:11:53.010]  I have an ABC News story that shows our Obama fascist posters up all over Chicago and they don't give us any credit on ABC or whoever put them up.
[01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:58.813]  They say that it's the local Palestinian who originally photoshopped a
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.362]  Progenitor of the Obama poster.
[01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:11.228]  He and a Photoshop... I think he said contest or game.
[01:12:11.228 --> 01:12:12.669]  He was online.
[01:12:12.669 --> 01:12:23.198]  I saw on news because I think he said on Facebook there was like some unofficial contest where they were doing Photoshop and he just threw it up there and somebody took it, altered it, added socialism to it.
[01:12:23.198 --> 01:12:25.901]  The point is, is that
[01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:42.370]  The news is now showing the fascist posters and the Infowars posters and saying that he's the guy that basically put the poster out and that it's almost like it's his fault, like it's something bad.
[01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:47.992]  And this Chicago ABC news piece is just really sickening.
[01:12:47.992 --> 01:12:50.313]  Maybe we'll play it later if we have time.
[01:12:50.313 --> 01:12:58.735]  And they go to this Palestinian American and he apologizes and apologizes for the poster and says it's wrong and people shouldn't criticize the president.
[01:12:58.735 --> 01:12:59.756]  He likes the president.
[01:13:00.456 --> 01:13:16.125]  And so, it's almost like they go get a false confession from somebody who isn't even involved to say, look, even the person that did it is saying he's sorry to the president.
[01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:21.528]  So the average person watching this would believe that.
[01:13:21.528 --> 01:13:25.191]  But the issue here is felony vandalism charges possible
[01:13:26.164 --> 01:13:44.195]  In Obama poster case, a Florida teenager could find himself in a sticky situation as a state attorney prepares to review possible felony vandalism charges in connection to the posters depicting President Obama as the Joker.
[01:13:44.195 --> 01:13:54.222]  A Florida teenager could face felony vandalism charges for allegedly gulling posters depicting President Obama as the Joker onto public property.
[01:13:55.987 --> 01:13:58.948]  And it goes on.
[01:13:58.948 --> 01:14:22.479]  Claremont, Florida Police Captain Eric Jensen said the state attorney will review evidence to determine whether or not to charge the unidentified teenager with gluing dozens of the posters last week to city light poles, public and private buildings, bridge overpasses, road signs, and a mailbox.
[01:14:24.298 --> 01:14:33.642]  Jensen said damage to city property exceeded $800 and it cost roughly $200 to remove the adhesive that was used to affix the poster on the mailbox.
[01:14:33.642 --> 01:14:41.426]  If he hadn't glued them, we wouldn't be having this discussion, Jensen told Fox News.
[01:14:41.426 --> 01:14:46.428]  If convicted of felony vandalism, the teenager could face a maximum of five years in jail.
[01:14:46.428 --> 01:14:48.309]  No arrests have been made yet in the case.
[01:14:50.031 --> 01:14:59.941]  Bill Gladson of the Florida's 5th Circuit Judicial Court, which oversees Lake County, confirmed that State Attorney Brad King will receive the case as early as Wednesday.
[01:14:59.941 --> 01:15:02.423]  This came out Tuesday.
[01:15:02.423 --> 01:15:10.110]  We look at every case that gets dropped off, he said, declining further comment until the case was filed, is received.
[01:15:10.953 --> 01:15:23.297]  Gladson said he could not recall a recent case involving potential charges of felony vandalism in regard to posters, including those pertaining to political messages.
[01:15:23.297 --> 01:15:30.100]  And they have the ACLU in here saying, well, this is a property issue, so it's not protected by the First Amendment.
[01:15:30.714 --> 01:15:41.524]  Ladies and gentlemen, the point is, is that it's selective enforcement because there's other posters of everything else you can imagine, including pro-Obama posters stuck directly on stop signs.
[01:15:41.524 --> 01:15:48.770]  Now, we told people from day one in the rules and on the radio, stick it where posters are commonly put up.
[01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:56.897]  And you saw me go out, I stuck them up where I saw other garage sale signs that had been hanging there for weeks.
[01:15:56.897 --> 01:15:57.598]  I went and hung it.
[01:15:58.829 --> 01:16:00.010]  On things like that.
[01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:03.354]  We went and put them up on South Congress where there were other handbills.
[01:16:03.354 --> 01:16:06.458]  We put them up over other people's, as is customary.
[01:16:08.775 --> 01:16:19.103]  Now, I guess they could try to nickel and dime and say, oh well, some cities have ordinances or not, but I mean, you don't go out and arrest the local rock band for putting up a hundred posters.
[01:16:19.103 --> 01:16:25.047]  You don't go out and arrest people putting pro-Obama posters that are all over Austin for the last year and a half.
[01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:32.693]  I mean, right during the election, up until the election, almost every light pole in town and stop signs had Obama stuck on them.
[01:16:32.693 --> 01:16:36.796]  I mean, did you hear ninnying and freaking out and hand-wringing and
[01:16:38.288 --> 01:16:45.032]  People all being scared to death?
[01:16:45.032 --> 01:16:47.854]  Concerning things like this?
[01:16:49.437 --> 01:16:50.278]  No.
[01:16:50.278 --> 01:16:54.543]  You didn't see him saying arrest whoever put up the Obama posters that were pro-Obama.
[01:16:54.543 --> 01:17:02.711]  You didn't hear him talking about victims and oh, the police are interviewing victims that they were victimized by seeing it on a light pole.
[01:17:02.711 --> 01:17:06.075]  They were victimized by seeing it on a telephone pole.
[01:17:06.075 --> 01:17:07.276]  And we played the clips.
[01:17:07.276 --> 01:17:07.957]  It's mean.
[01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:08.678]  It's nasty.
[01:17:08.678 --> 01:17:09.339]  It's scary.
[01:17:09.339 --> 01:17:10.039]  You can't do it.
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:19.963]  National Spanish TV said I need to be arrested and that it's clearly racism because the president's brown and we don't like brown people.
[01:17:19.963 --> 01:17:23.884]  And then National TV says, you know, that socialism's the new N-word.
[01:17:23.884 --> 01:17:29.645]  I mean, this is Soviet mind control.
[01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:31.706]  This is a huge chilling effect.
[01:17:39.747 --> 01:17:47.173]  And I, for one, am just so completely sick of it.
[01:17:47.173 --> 01:17:48.254]  And so what's happened?
[01:17:48.254 --> 01:17:53.798]  Their intimidation of people's First Amendment has now blown up in their face.
[01:17:53.798 --> 01:18:02.965]  The police were on the news a few days ago admitting, yeah, we took down hundreds of these around the city and hundreds more pop back up.
[01:18:02.965 --> 01:18:04.206]  And they have this instinct of
[01:18:07.031 --> 01:18:13.175]  Tyrants to go oppress and selectively enforce on some teenager because he talked to him.
[01:18:13.175 --> 01:18:17.678]  We want the teenager to contact us.
[01:18:17.678 --> 01:18:19.439]  Send us emails.
[01:18:19.439 --> 01:18:21.960]  Call us.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.442]  Send us an email at Riders and Infowars.
[01:18:24.442 --> 01:18:26.383]  Might be a good one to check.
[01:18:26.383 --> 01:18:28.345]  Showtips and Infowars.
[01:18:28.345 --> 01:18:30.906]  We'd like to have this young man on the radio.
[01:18:30.906 --> 01:18:31.907]  I'd like to talk to him.
[01:18:33.294 --> 01:18:35.215]  A lot of people want to support you.
[01:18:35.215 --> 01:18:53.206]  The good news is, on the newspapers and on the TV station reports, on every one of them, 90 plus percent, maybe 1 out of 10 comments, is against you putting the posters up.
[01:18:53.206 --> 01:18:55.007]  9 out of 10, and that's conservative.
[01:18:56.288 --> 01:18:57.168]  There's probably more than that.
[01:18:57.168 --> 01:18:58.669]  You can go look for yourselves.
[01:18:58.669 --> 01:19:01.989]  You'll see comment after comment after comment saying, this is ridiculous.
[01:19:01.989 --> 01:19:03.710]  This is selective enforcement.
[01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:09.751]  Why didn't people care about all the pro-Obama signs I saw stuck on telephone poles and stop signs?
[01:19:09.751 --> 01:19:11.392]  What's the big deal here?
[01:19:11.392 --> 01:19:13.552]  Why are they spending all their manpower on this?
[01:19:13.552 --> 01:19:19.674]  And then you have the issue of Florida and all the corruption and drug dealing by government and the CPS kidnapping.
[01:19:19.674 --> 01:19:23.454]  Tens of thousands of kids, thousands of them missing.
[01:19:23.454 --> 01:19:25.675]  The bank stealing trillions, not getting in trouble.
[01:19:27.358 --> 01:19:29.919]  I mean, you have the government all self-righteously.
[01:19:29.919 --> 01:19:32.380]  We're going to get to the bottom of this caper.
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.800]  We're going to find out who the evil, you know.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.141]  And people in the news are going, it's scary, did you see it?
[01:19:38.141 --> 01:19:39.041]  Oh no!
[01:19:39.041 --> 01:19:42.162]  I mean, it's like satire, it's so ridiculous.
[01:19:42.162 --> 01:19:44.843]  I mean, this is land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:19:44.843 --> 01:19:47.464]  The people they talk to on the news, their knees are knocking.
[01:19:47.464 --> 01:19:50.625]  You know, the newscasters look all freaked out.
[01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:52.065]  Something horrible's happened.
[01:19:52.065 --> 01:19:53.886]  They're talking bad about our dear leader.
[01:19:55.603 --> 01:20:01.649]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:20:01.649 --> 01:20:07.535]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:20:07.535 --> 01:20:13.702]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:20:14.022 --> 01:20:15.983]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:20:15.983 --> 01:20:18.464]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:20:18.464 --> 01:20:31.629]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:33.310]  It's not about left or right.
[01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:35.170]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:41.413]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:20:42.077 --> 01:20:50.344]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:50.344 --> 01:20:51.906]  The Obama Deception.
[01:20:51.906 --> 01:20:53.107]  The people strike back!
[01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:57.054]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:57.054 --> 01:21:01.776]  It's Ron Paul's birthday and also Money Mom Day for Ron Paul's 2010 bid for U.S.
[01:21:01.776 --> 01:21:02.396]  Senate.
[01:21:02.396 --> 01:21:06.317]  I'm happy to report a very successful fundraiser at 1130 a.m.
[01:21:06.317 --> 01:21:11.199]  Central Time and has already raised $439,220.

[01:21:20.461 --> 01:21:22.422]  And happy birthday to the Ron Paul family.
[01:21:24.537 --> 01:21:27.499]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:21:27.499 --> 01:21:30.121]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:21:30.121 --> 01:21:33.944]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:21:33.944 --> 01:21:41.189]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:21:55.192 --> 01:21:55.920]  Studies have shown
[01:22:05.983 --> 01:22:07.364]  The answer is simple.
[01:22:07.364 --> 01:22:08.924]  PureBulk.com.

[01:23:29.486 --> 01:23:35.293]  They have established an unequal reputation of quality for supplying their safes and vault doors to residential customers.
[01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:35.593]  We're good.
[01:24:05.171 --> 01:24:06.812]  We're good to go.
[01:24:33.596 --> 01:24:50.825]  So it's national news that you will be arrested, you will be felony charged, if you dare to put up a poster depicting Obama in a bad light.
[01:24:50.825 --> 01:24:56.929]  But the President can go on the Washington Post and say, put them up on stop signs, worship me, and that's A-OK.
[01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:01.048]  And the ACLU says that's A-OK.
[01:25:01.048 --> 01:25:06.069]  That's how sick this system has gotten.
[01:25:06.069 --> 01:25:13.730]  You know, I mentioned that headline story about government permission will be required to travel.
[01:25:13.730 --> 01:25:16.771]  Do people realize what this is?
[01:25:16.771 --> 01:25:26.253]  They've said that if you are on the no-fly list, no judge, no jury, no charges, no facing your accuser, that you will now not be able to own a gun or buy a gun.
[01:25:28.783 --> 01:25:32.944]  They say you're not going to be able to have a job.
[01:25:32.944 --> 01:25:36.764]  If you have bad credit, you're not going to be able to fly.
[01:25:36.764 --> 01:25:39.445]  This is the new debtor's prison.
[01:25:39.445 --> 01:25:40.905]  This is the new gulag.
[01:25:40.905 --> 01:25:46.426]  This is the new way that the establishment wants to put people into these reservations.
[01:25:46.426 --> 01:25:50.467]  That's the same thing the Soviets did, the Nazis did, Mao did this.
[01:25:50.467 --> 01:25:51.187]  It's a system.
[01:25:51.187 --> 01:25:53.787]  They shut your economic system off first.
[01:25:53.787 --> 01:25:55.088]  They destroy you economically.
[01:25:55.088 --> 01:25:56.388]  It's like when the feds raid you.
[01:25:57.239 --> 01:25:57.459]  I think?
[01:26:14.482 --> 01:26:16.324]  They said, well, I guess it's just something you got to do.
[01:26:16.324 --> 01:26:18.667]  But there's that thought.
[01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:23.652]  But Steve, you then give in through fear and don't stand up because you may be blacklisted.
[01:26:23.652 --> 01:26:25.975]  I mean, think McCarthy would keep you from getting a job.
[01:26:25.975 --> 01:26:30.721]  And the left always talks about that all day.
[01:26:32.714 --> 01:26:34.614]  But, this is bipartisan.
[01:26:34.614 --> 01:26:43.476]  This is Homeland Security engaged in blacklisting from flying, from living, from having a job, from owning a gun.
[01:26:43.476 --> 01:26:47.757]  This is the total end of habeas corpus, end of due process, end of everything.
[01:26:47.757 --> 01:26:57.479]  I mean, it's so big, and even groups that you, you know, who are analyzing it, I respectfully think don't get one-tenth of how bad it is.
[01:26:57.479 --> 01:27:00.480]  This Campaign for Liberty article is a good one.
[01:27:01.736 --> 01:27:09.285]  Uh, and so, but, you know, we've got it up on Infowars.com, but government permission will be required to travel.
[01:27:09.285 --> 01:27:13.329]  Starting this year, Americans will have to get government approval to travel by air.
[01:27:14.252 --> 01:27:20.456]  As Privacy Journal revealed last fall, henceforth permission will now be needed to travel in the United States.
[01:27:20.456 --> 01:27:21.757]  That's from the government.
[01:27:21.757 --> 01:27:28.541]  In quotes, getting a reservation and checking in for air travel will soon require transportation, security administration authorization.
[01:27:28.541 --> 01:27:33.404]  See, they're now extrajudicial judge, jury, and executioner.
[01:27:33.404 --> 01:27:41.489]  And Homeland Security admits they're training people to accept all of this on the airlines.
[01:27:43.485 --> 01:27:52.493]  And in those high security situations, and then now it's on trains, and buses, and at checkpoints, and oh, the Army's here at the checkpoint!
[01:27:52.493 --> 01:27:59.260]  The Marines are here at the checkpoint!
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:04.705]  It's just... Our transformation into a total gulag is really happening.
[01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:07.307]  That permission is by no means assured.
[01:28:07.307 --> 01:28:19.493]  For example, if your name matches a no-fly list, even mistakenly... See, they even advertise that, oh, it's a mistake, but you still can't fly, even setting the precedent there.
[01:28:19.493 --> 01:28:20.293]  It isn't a mistake.
[01:28:20.293 --> 01:28:21.794]  They politically are punishing people.
[01:28:21.794 --> 01:28:22.694]  They admit that.
[01:28:22.694 --> 01:28:24.955]  That's come out in federal court.
[01:28:24.955 --> 01:28:26.036]  We have to say no to this.
[01:28:27.352 --> 01:28:28.893]  The permission is by no means assured.
[01:28:28.893 --> 01:28:35.117]  For example, if your name matches a no-fly list, even mistakenly, you can be denied the right to reserve a seat on a flight.
[01:28:35.117 --> 01:28:41.280]  If your name is on a selectee list, you and your possessions will be searched more thoroughly before you can board.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.222]  So see, they also put you on a harassment list.
[01:28:44.222 --> 01:28:55.789]  And now a lot of police departments are dialing in to these different private databases, more sophisticated than Google, kind of like a LexisNexis Reuters search.
[01:28:55.789 --> 01:28:56.970]  And they know everything about you.
[01:29:00.230 --> 01:29:12.617]  And they have the face scanning cameras and the license plate cameras and then the feds are now coming in setting up these fusion centers which really federalize and then teach the police how to use all these tools.
[01:29:12.617 --> 01:29:20.182]  Again, the government's massing all this technological spy and military system up.
[01:29:20.182 --> 01:29:23.024]  They're building all this up while trying to then disarm us.
[01:29:25.441 --> 01:29:29.743]  Protecting air safety is essential, but professional screening at airports already provides for it.
[01:29:29.743 --> 01:29:30.383]  See?
[01:29:30.383 --> 01:29:31.824]  It's kinda weak.
[01:29:31.824 --> 01:29:41.028]  Giving the TSA, as an official agency, the additional authority to decide who gets to go where reaches beyond safety into over-extended governmental power.
[01:29:41.028 --> 01:29:42.389]  Well, yeah.
[01:29:42.389 --> 01:29:45.691]  It totally ends freedom.
[01:29:45.691 --> 01:29:47.091]  We're on the march.
[01:29:47.091 --> 01:29:49.633]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:49.633 --> 01:29:52.314]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.872 --> 01:29:59.093]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:01.113]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:30:01.113 --> 01:30:09.615]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:30:09.615 --> 01:30:15.177]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:30:15.177 --> 01:30:16.777]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:30:17.037 --> 01:30:23.562]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:30:23.562 --> 01:30:34.610]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:35.070]  That's right.
[01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:37.931]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:30:37.931 --> 01:30:39.751]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.

[01:30:54.710 --> 01:31:00.017]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:00.017 --> 01:31:04.543]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:04.543 --> 01:31:06.826]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:06.826 --> 01:31:08.448]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:08.448 --> 01:31:09.470]  There is a solution.
[01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:18.135]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:57.951]  It is a big idea.
[01:31:57.951 --> 01:32:00.172]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:32:01.531 --> 01:32:04.592]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:32:04.592 --> 01:32:07.474]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:32:07.474 --> 01:32:10.215]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[01:32:10.215 --> 01:32:13.397]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:32:13.397 --> 01:32:23.741]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:32:23.741 --> 01:32:25.082]  For the first time in history,
[01:32:25.515 --> 01:32:29.178]  The Elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:32:29.178 --> 01:32:32.500]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:35.622]  The Oval Bureau is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:32:35.622 --> 01:32:36.783]  Most people have no idea.
[01:32:36.783 --> 01:32:37.563]  They're not after money.
[01:32:37.563 --> 01:32:38.864]  They have all the money they need.
[01:32:38.864 --> 01:32:39.825]  They're after power.
[01:32:39.825 --> 01:32:40.985]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:32:49.691 --> 01:32:50.452]  Endgame.
[01:32:50.452 --> 01:32:52.513]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:32:52.513 --> 01:32:53.674]  You have been warned.
[01:33:06.892 --> 01:33:11.736]  Is it getting better?
[01:33:11.736 --> 01:33:17.061]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:33:17.061 --> 01:33:19.383]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[01:33:19.383 --> 01:33:25.367]  You've got someone to blame.
[01:33:25.367 --> 01:33:32.734]  You said one love, one life, when it's one need.
[01:33:34.338 --> 01:33:42.119]  You see, the globalists only have to hold the high ground in science and technology and weapon systems.
[01:33:42.119 --> 01:34:00.943]  And then using their sociology, their psychology, play us all off against each other, balkanize us along all these different racial and religious lines, because that's how we're programmed tribally to, you know, defend our territory against neighbors.
[01:34:00.943 --> 01:34:01.383]  And so,
[01:34:03.399 --> 01:34:05.420]  We're in this primitive paradigm.
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:14.625]  They're manipulating those inputs, those instincts, those activities.
[01:34:14.625 --> 01:34:31.054]  And I remember, like I said earlier in the first hour, being invited by the Libertarian Longhorns and the Young Conservatives to a Texas Independence Day birthday
[01:34:32.475 --> 01:34:35.197]  Celebration.
[01:34:35.197 --> 01:34:42.543]  And I went down there to give a speech.
[01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:54.213]  And folks showed up in Aztec headdresses and ran up and grabbed the birthday cake, crammed it in their mouth, spit it back out on the cake.
[01:34:54.213 --> 01:34:56.455]  A black guy came running up, grabbed the microphone.
[01:34:56.455 --> 01:34:57.396]  I didn't want to get in a fight with him.
[01:34:57.396 --> 01:34:59.598]  I just gave it to him and said, you're a racist.
[01:35:00.882 --> 01:35:04.625]  And I said, well, that doesn't really... I said to the guy, I said, I'm pretty young.
[01:35:04.625 --> 01:35:07.066]  I don't have a bunch of white guilt.
[01:35:07.066 --> 01:35:12.650]  I didn't grow up when people drank out of different water fountains and stuff.
[01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:16.493]  I said, I really don't appreciate you saying that, but it doesn't have any power over me.
[01:35:16.493 --> 01:35:16.973]  I don't care.
[01:35:16.973 --> 01:35:23.658]  Because it's a very fine line you've got to walk.
[01:35:23.658 --> 01:35:27.080]  Because when you get real racism thrown at you by
[01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:33.273]  Hispanic groups, bi, racist, black groups.
[01:35:33.273 --> 01:35:53.628]  You have to understand what they're doing and understand the perspective they're coming from and not hate them back and not get into the tribalism with them, but at the same time you've got to also understand that that's being used as a tool of vulcanization and nevertheless
[01:35:54.685 --> 01:35:57.007]  That that is going on and that is happening.
[01:35:57.007 --> 01:36:06.896]  Same thing for black people and Hispanics that have had white racism and discrimination, which certainly goes on, directed at them.
[01:36:06.896 --> 01:36:09.839]  You have to be able to separate that out.
[01:36:09.839 --> 01:36:17.166]  So how do I not play in to the paradigm of balkanization and racial hatred and division
[01:36:18.803 --> 01:36:32.025]  When we try to point out that we can't have completely open borders, we can't have 14 towns in South Texas flying the Mexican flag and speaking Spanish in their courthouses and English isn't allowed.
[01:36:32.025 --> 01:36:38.346]  That's San Antonio Express News Report.
[01:36:38.346 --> 01:36:47.348]  I mean, we can't have 30 million people here, at least half of them, believing this is Mexico from Texas to California and all the states in between.
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:50.940]  Aslan.
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:53.921]  Maybe we should put a map of Aslan up.
[01:36:53.921 --> 01:37:09.266]  Ataslan, Aslan, Texas, New Mexico, part of Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, California, up into Oregon.
[01:37:09.266 --> 01:37:10.807]  And this is taught.
[01:37:10.807 --> 01:37:19.050]  I mean, when I was in high school here in Austin, I went to Dallas some, and then last couple years here in Austin, I was in the art class.
[01:37:20.231 --> 01:37:27.535]  And she took us on a field trip one day to see the UT Art Museum.
[01:37:27.535 --> 01:37:28.396]  Something along those lines.
[01:37:28.396 --> 01:37:30.517]  It was a UT art display.
[01:37:30.517 --> 01:37:34.139]  And there was a Hispanic artist who gave us the tour of his art.
[01:37:35.231 --> 01:37:39.978]  And it was all about how evil America is, and how evil the gringo is, and La Reconquista.
[01:37:39.978 --> 01:37:43.844]  And I, just because I'd read a lot of history books, wasn't even into that at that time.
[01:37:43.844 --> 01:37:44.645]  Didn't even really know.
[01:37:44.645 --> 01:37:50.514]  And I was like, yes, but Mexico also did control Guatemala.
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:38:07.848]  And got kicked out by the natives down there, and Mexico was corrupt, and Santa Ana was a dictator, and the people were enslaved, and he was given a speech demonizing Texas, and I said, and I knew nothing about Texas history, and they got very freaked out, and he went and had a talk with the teacher, and said, who is this guy?
[01:38:07.848 --> 01:38:17.713]  They were like, oh yes, he's very, and it was just because I saw an attack on my country, and a distortion of my country.
[01:38:17.713 --> 01:38:19.714]  And so the point is, this is just everywhere.
[01:38:21.078 --> 01:38:30.765]  So then I'm kind of this Ron Paul type conservative libertarian, first few years on radio, as I'm really starting to go down the rabbit hole.
[01:38:30.765 --> 01:38:33.827]  And I get invited to come give a speech at UT, so I come down.
[01:38:33.827 --> 01:38:43.754]  I didn't even realize that the illegal aliens down there and others had pushed to have UT cancel Texas Independence Day parade.
[01:38:44.611 --> 01:38:46.853]  Because it's now considered racism.
[01:38:46.853 --> 01:38:47.934]  I mean, Texas Independence Day.
[01:38:47.934 --> 01:38:49.715]  You're not allowed to have it.
[01:38:49.715 --> 01:38:50.816]  Cities don't put it on.
[01:38:50.816 --> 01:38:51.837]  Counties don't put it on.
[01:38:51.837 --> 01:38:54.780]  I guess a few towns like Gonzales do.
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:55.740]  It's like it's dirty.
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:56.861]  It's bad.
[01:38:56.861 --> 01:39:00.244]  It's like liquor you gotta put in a brown bag.
[01:39:00.244 --> 01:39:02.726]  Or porno movies you gotta put in a bag or whatever.
[01:39:02.726 --> 01:39:03.607]  So nobody sees it.
[01:39:03.607 --> 01:39:05.108]  You know, when you're leaving the store.
[01:39:07.833 --> 01:39:18.743]  It's like bad, it's like the second amendment where you gotta sneak out to your car and put the rifle in and go to the gun range and look around because you've already had neighbors call cops on you when they see you putting a gun in your car.
[01:39:18.743 --> 01:39:22.127]  That's how screwed up our country is, folks.
[01:39:22.127 --> 01:39:24.909]  They take everything good and wholesome and they make it dirty.
[01:39:24.909 --> 01:39:30.955]  So then I began to learn more and more and more and more and more and more
[01:39:32.432 --> 01:39:48.779]  About all of this, and about the plan of San Diego, and how in the Spanish bilingual schools in Texas and California and other states they teach that they're going to overthrow and kill all whites 16 years of age and older.
[01:39:48.779 --> 01:39:55.122]  And that they actually launched the attack during World War I for the Germans.
[01:39:55.122 --> 01:39:57.663]  Mainline history, but nobody seems to know it.
[01:39:57.663 --> 01:39:59.444]  And killed a bunch of people in South Texas.
[01:40:01.678 --> 01:40:04.861]  And I know this, but then I'm not supposed to talk about it.
[01:40:04.861 --> 01:40:08.784]  I'm supposed to just sit here and put up with it.
[01:40:08.784 --> 01:40:16.470]  And then you go to the Cinco de Mayo parades and things, and it is all Oslon this, Down with America that.
[01:40:18.765 --> 01:40:24.709]  Right after 9-11, it was in the news that at these different rallies, they were saying, Osama didn't do enough.
[01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:26.291]  And of course, that's all a false paradigm.
[01:40:26.291 --> 01:40:27.872]  Osama bin Laden's a CIA front.
[01:40:27.872 --> 01:40:36.478]  But the issue is, at soccer games, when the American team was there one week after the attacks, they were chanting, Osama, Osama, Osama.
[01:40:36.478 --> 01:40:41.001]  I mean, the point is, Mexico, on average, really hates our guts.
[01:40:41.932 --> 01:40:46.974]  My wife, you know, maybe every two years or so, we go down to the Mexican Caribbean.
[01:40:46.974 --> 01:40:50.296]  And she said last time, she said, I don't want to go down there anymore.
[01:40:50.296 --> 01:40:51.036]  And I said, why?
[01:40:51.036 --> 01:40:52.577]  I go out, it's cheap and I like it.
[01:40:52.577 --> 01:40:55.338]  We can fly down there quick and go out and, you know, whatever.
[01:40:55.338 --> 01:40:59.680]  And she said, you know, I speak Spanish and I just don't like what they're saying about us.
[01:41:02.119 --> 01:41:17.207]  And it's just, look at these gringos scum, we're gonna slit their throats, we're gonna take their country down, and you're sitting there paying them, and they're living off of your business, but it's just like, you know, look at this stupid gringos.
[01:41:17.207 --> 01:41:20.188]  They ought to go back to Europe, stupid pilgrims.
[01:41:20.188 --> 01:41:28.493]  And, you know, my wife's gotta hear it in restaurants, because she's white, she just lived in Spain for four years, and as a kid, so she picked it up.
[01:41:29.975 --> 01:41:32.077]  And it's just constant.
[01:41:32.077 --> 01:41:33.758]  It's constant.
[01:41:33.758 --> 01:41:38.461]  I mean, it's the equivalent of being like a black guy, I guess, in the 1940s in Alabama.
[01:41:38.461 --> 01:41:43.004]  If he was in a white restaurant, it'd be, look at that, you know, N-word, this, that.
[01:41:43.004 --> 01:41:45.205]  But the black guy couldn't understand the language.
[01:41:45.205 --> 01:41:48.107]  He wouldn't even know what was going on.
[01:41:48.107 --> 01:41:50.229]  So it's this perfect
[01:41:52.645 --> 01:42:04.171]  It's this perfect way for this racism and balkanization to grow because these stupid yuppies don't even know the three branches of government.
[01:42:04.171 --> 01:42:11.935]  They don't even understand the basic ways societies work and operate.
[01:42:11.935 --> 01:42:21.741]  And so, how are they gonna know what people that have a totally different culture, highly nationalistic, racially based,
[01:42:22.791 --> 01:42:29.094]  That lost two wars with us and hate our guts fundamentally.
[01:42:29.094 --> 01:42:31.655]  I mean, it's a fact.
[01:42:31.655 --> 01:42:35.176]  And you've got the government and the media teamed up because the government's globalist.
[01:42:35.176 --> 01:42:36.357]  They want to break the country down.
[01:42:36.357 --> 01:42:37.778]  They want to bankrupt the jobs.
[01:42:37.778 --> 01:42:39.058]  They want to drive the wages down.
[01:42:39.058 --> 01:42:39.999]  They want to use the U.S.
[01:42:39.999 --> 01:42:45.521]  as a steam valve so there's not a real revolution in Mexico so they can actually get some freedom.
[01:42:45.521 --> 01:42:51.524]  Mexico is the second most corrupt nation on earth after North Korea in all the different international indexes.
[01:42:52.389 --> 01:42:55.390]  United States is number six now.
[01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:57.890]  So we're not too good either.
[01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:59.691]  And America is falling.
[01:42:59.691 --> 01:43:02.112]  We are losing our engine of a free market.
[01:43:02.112 --> 01:43:03.632]  It's probably over for us.
[01:43:03.632 --> 01:43:06.213]  You know, the question now is what can we salvage?
[01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:14.935]  And again, the saddest part about this is Hispanic Americans are wonderful, salt of the earth, good people.
[01:43:14.935 --> 01:43:18.796]  And that's one hardworking, smart, intelligent, inventive group.
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:36.406]  Who just really don't really talk about the kind of racist people that have picked up this liberation theology taught by the U.S.
[01:43:36.406 --> 01:43:37.306]  government in Mexico.
[01:43:37.306 --> 01:43:37.646]  The U.S.
[01:43:37.646 --> 01:43:39.147]  government has come out in the news.
[01:43:39.147 --> 01:43:47.470]  In the 50s, started paying for millions a year of little comic books in Spanish about La Reconquista and Aslan and the Southwest.
[01:43:48.393 --> 01:43:51.494]  Because they planned this all along.
[01:43:51.494 --> 01:43:54.254]  And so I'm going to play a clip of this.
[01:43:54.254 --> 01:43:56.775]  We tried to find a spot where there's no cussing.
[01:43:56.775 --> 01:44:00.096]  The really bad stuff's up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:44:00.096 --> 01:44:05.797]  And we'll play some of that without audio for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and radio listeners.
[01:44:05.797 --> 01:44:10.718]  But it's up on the Alex Jones channel at YouTube as well.
[01:44:10.718 --> 01:44:17.800]  This clip is a bunch of illegal aliens and I guess citizens in the Texas town
[01:44:19.736 --> 01:44:23.359]  of Trinity, Texas, at a town hall meeting.
[01:44:23.359 --> 01:44:30.346]  And in the town hall, one of the issues brought up in one of the sections is that illegal aliens get unlimited free health care.
[01:44:31.854 --> 01:44:33.095]  Which is bankrupting the country.
[01:44:33.095 --> 01:44:35.537]  I mean, there's billions of people who want to come here.
[01:44:35.537 --> 01:44:37.298]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions of Latin Americans.
[01:44:37.298 --> 01:44:38.219]  We can't.
[01:44:38.219 --> 01:44:40.080]  Have you been to Mexico City?
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.521]  We just can't do it.
[01:44:41.521 --> 01:44:43.883]  California is now bankrupt and falling.
[01:44:43.883 --> 01:44:46.165]  Texas is on the verge of going bankrupt.
[01:44:46.165 --> 01:44:50.828]  Just paying for the prisoners alone in California is over $10 billion a year.
[01:44:50.828 --> 01:44:54.912]  Because it's not that the Mexicans are all criminals, it's that they're criminals come up here.
[01:44:55.854 --> 01:45:02.159]  They can come up here with fake names, fake IDs, run from the law, jump back and forth, commit crimes.
[01:45:02.159 --> 01:45:11.167]  I mean, it's just an unlimited, undocumented, can do whatever they want.
[01:45:11.167 --> 01:45:18.033]  And I remember when my cousin was in high school in San Antonio, and I'd go down there every summer, spend a few weeks.
[01:45:19.747 --> 01:45:27.669]  I go down there at Christmas and spend a week and I remember most of his friends were Hispanic and they were all, their dads were all veterans of the military, you know, pro-USA 100%.
[01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:34.852]  And they would say, hey man, what do you think of the, they would use a derogatory term for the illegal aliens.
[01:45:34.852 --> 01:45:40.233]  And I thought it was some test or something if I was a racist, you know, white guilt, little chicken-necked yuppie.
[01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:42.114]  And I would like, no, I don't know.
[01:45:42.114 --> 01:45:45.255]  Well, they want to bring America down and they're bad news and blah, blah, blah.
[01:45:46.485 --> 01:45:51.528]  So, I mean, the people that really know about this are Mexican-Americans who just want to be called Americans.
[01:45:51.528 --> 01:45:56.110]  I mean, you know, I'm English and German and Native American and a bunch of other Irish, Scottish.
[01:45:56.110 --> 01:45:57.711]  I don't run around calling myself all these things.
[01:45:57.711 --> 01:45:59.252]  I'm just an American.
[01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:01.153]  See, they don't want us living in peace.
[01:46:01.153 --> 01:46:02.694]  They want us all fighting with each other.
[01:46:02.694 --> 01:46:06.016]  But if it's a global plan to use these people to bring the U.S.
[01:46:06.016 --> 01:46:07.917]  down, we have to address it.
[01:46:07.917 --> 01:46:09.197]  So it's a Catch-22.
[01:46:09.197 --> 01:46:10.258]  How do you not address it?
[01:46:13.066 --> 01:46:13.847]  That's what it is!
[01:46:13.847 --> 01:46:17.189]  We're the majority now, not the minority!
[01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:18.830]  Y'all are the minority now!
[01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:19.250]  Take it over!
[01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:20.631]  Take it over what?
[01:46:20.631 --> 01:46:23.013]  Take it over America, right?
[01:46:35.721 --> 01:46:40.764]  And then the rally ends with mariachi music and Mexican flags.
[01:47:11.599 --> 01:47:16.382]  And there's video of them coming over and starting fights with everybody.
[01:47:16.382 --> 01:47:21.064]  And, you know, there's just old men going, I don't want the health care bill.
[01:47:21.064 --> 01:47:24.506]  They're like, racist, puto.
[01:47:24.506 --> 01:47:30.749]  I mean, on and on and on and on.
[01:47:30.749 --> 01:47:31.910]  It's just so sick.
[01:47:33.723 --> 01:47:45.511]  Meanwhile, the vaccines and soft kill weapons are designed to attack the brain and pancreas, and it's designed especially for people of Mesoamerican bloodlines.
[01:47:45.511 --> 01:47:50.495]  Let's put the Portley fellow back up on screen.
[01:47:50.495 --> 01:47:59.181]  They've done studies that Americans were eating a similar diet even 40, 45, 50 years ago and weren't this fat.
[01:47:59.181 --> 01:48:01.843]  Why especially do you see Hispanics
[01:48:03.868 --> 01:48:04.188]  What is it?
[01:48:04.188 --> 01:48:07.109]  In some areas, half the Hispanics have diabetes?
[01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:11.250]  Why is this guy going to probably end up having his legs amputated?
[01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:14.091]  Why is this guy going to end up, probably when he's 40, dead?
[01:48:14.091 --> 01:48:17.071]  See, I actually love this guy.
[01:48:17.071 --> 01:48:21.872]  He's probably a sweet person if you were out fishing with him or working with him or doing something.
[01:48:21.872 --> 01:48:28.174]  He feels threatened by these white guys who've got American flags and some black guys with them that they call the N-word.
[01:48:28.174 --> 01:48:30.194]  He feels, they just yell it over and over again.
[01:48:30.194 --> 01:48:30.795]  We're not going to play it.
[01:48:30.795 --> 01:48:32.055]  There's too many cuss words mixed in.
[01:48:33.812 --> 01:48:34.172]  I don't know.
[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:56.307]  And at a subconscious level, he knows that America doesn't really like him.
[01:48:56.307 --> 01:48:58.591]  And so he's going to embrace that.
[01:48:58.591 --> 01:49:01.015]  And he's got big Larry Conquista tattoos.
[01:49:01.015 --> 01:49:04.039]  Now this guy probably doesn't even eat that much.
[01:49:05.483 --> 01:49:08.424]  He's probably got diabetes because of the vaccine.
[01:49:08.424 --> 01:49:13.625]  We've had top surgeons and brain surgeons and endocrinologists on this show.
[01:49:13.625 --> 01:49:19.947]  It is a fact that they cause an autoimmune response in the pancreas, and that's why you lose your pancreas.
[01:49:19.947 --> 01:49:23.728]  Mommy thought she was helping you when you were in school and gave you all those shots.
[01:49:23.728 --> 01:49:25.828]  It's race-specific, the studies show.
[01:49:25.828 --> 01:49:27.609]  It hurts whites, but not as bad as it hurts you.
[01:49:29.528 --> 01:49:35.230]  You think some good old boys out there that don't want to live in communist country are bad because they're white?
[01:49:35.230 --> 01:49:45.153]  You don't know the real eugenicist, see him as subhuman, and have already injected him with something that knocked his pancreas out.
[01:49:45.153 --> 01:49:46.733]  I want to say this right now.
[01:49:46.733 --> 01:49:47.553]  I want to pray for this guy.
[01:49:47.553 --> 01:49:48.954]  I'm serious.
[01:49:48.954 --> 01:49:54.875]  God, please help this guy understand what's happened to him and to fight the New World Order.
[01:49:54.875 --> 01:49:56.916]  And please help the guys in the Mariachi band.
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:02.521]  To wake up against the New World Order and we can all just work together instead of doing this, please.
[01:50:02.521 --> 01:50:09.662]  Because I feel for these little Hispanic children being given the vaccine shots that are going to die from them down the road.
[01:50:09.662 --> 01:50:11.522]  Many people dying immediately.
[01:50:11.522 --> 01:50:13.083]  Please help us all just come together.
[01:50:13.083 --> 01:50:17.204]  Because this guy is gregarious and smiley and happy.
[01:50:17.204 --> 01:50:18.644]  And I don't think he's inherently evil.
[01:50:18.644 --> 01:50:22.525]  I just think he's raw-rawing for his football team.
[01:50:22.525 --> 01:50:24.605]  And just help us all come out of this.
[01:50:24.605 --> 01:50:24.865]  Amen.
[01:50:27.079 --> 01:50:34.223]  So there, I've said my prayer for this guy, because, I mean, look, it's sad.
[01:50:34.223 --> 01:50:43.009]  Who he needs to be against is John P. Holdren, author of Ecoscience, Population, Resources, and Environment.
[01:50:43.009 --> 01:50:44.350]  He's the guy that did it to you, pal.
[01:50:55.828 --> 01:50:57.109]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:58.950]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[01:50:58.950 --> 01:51:00.771]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[01:51:00.771 --> 01:51:05.674]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[01:51:05.674 --> 01:51:10.697]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.
[01:51:10.697 --> 01:51:12.658]  Introducing Choose4Health.
[01:51:12.658 --> 01:51:18.282]  Choose4Health brings you 16 powerful ingredients in one delicious chewable for around 75 cents per day.

[01:51:40.791 --> 01:51:41.192]  I think so.
[01:51:55.794 --> 01:52:01.599]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:01.599 --> 01:52:09.186]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:52:09.186 --> 01:52:15.352]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:15.772 --> 01:52:17.733]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:17.733 --> 01:52:20.233]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:20.233 --> 01:52:31.817]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:31.817 --> 01:52:33.497]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:33.497 --> 01:52:35.358]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:35.358 --> 01:52:41.580]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:42.245 --> 01:52:50.510]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:52.090]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:52.090 --> 01:52:55.192]  The people strike back.
[01:52:55.192 --> 01:53:01.896]  eCigarettesNational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:53:01.896 --> 01:53:03.557]  It's called the eCigarette.
[01:53:03.557 --> 01:53:08.139]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:53:08.139 --> 01:53:09.900]  But because this is not a cigarette,
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:15.806]  You don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:53:15.806 --> 01:53:20.671]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire and has no dangerous second-hand smoke.

[01:53:55.297 --> 01:54:05.959]  I'm telling the guys just to show people on TV the video without the audio and all the cuss words.
[01:54:05.959 --> 01:54:10.840]  Again, you can watch it up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[01:54:24.810 --> 01:54:41.756]  With these illegal aliens and I guess US citizens or whatever they are just screaming, calling the white people and the black people in words, in their face saying, come on, I want to physically attack you.
[01:54:41.756 --> 01:54:43.837]  And I'm not being macho here.
[01:54:43.837 --> 01:54:45.138]  People seen me at these rallies.
[01:54:45.138 --> 01:54:45.738]  I go ahead and
[01:54:48.177 --> 01:54:51.019]  Say, come on, and kind of go wild, so.
[01:54:51.019 --> 01:54:57.022]  Because, I mean, there's something about a whole group of people, tribally, wanting to attack you, that gets you going.
[01:54:57.022 --> 01:54:59.583]  And I understand the power of this.
[01:54:59.583 --> 01:55:05.626]  In fact, did you guys cue up Battle for the Republic?
[01:55:05.626 --> 01:55:14.191]  Maybe later I'll play a clip of Battle for the Republic, where they, it's the extras from Endgame.
[01:55:14.191 --> 01:55:15.592]  But it's all over YouTube and Google.
[01:55:16.621 --> 01:55:26.770]  Where the American citizen protests peacefully 50 yards away from illegal aliens with an unpermitted protest, which is fine.
[01:55:26.770 --> 01:55:29.052]  But you know, the citizens do that, we get SWAT teamed.
[01:55:29.052 --> 01:55:31.474]  The illegals were left alone.
[01:55:31.474 --> 01:55:36.879]  And the illegals don't like him protesting, so the police come over, tell him, you can't protest.
[01:55:36.879 --> 01:55:40.502]  They take him, they slam his head in the ground, splits his head open.
[01:55:40.502 --> 01:55:43.625]  The cops get up, high five the illegal aliens.
[01:55:45.134 --> 01:55:48.835]  And then the illegal aliens celebrate as he's put in handcuffs with blood pouring.
[01:55:48.835 --> 01:55:53.036]  And it's just this celebration of pure evil.
[01:55:53.036 --> 01:55:54.336]  It's injustice.
[01:55:54.336 --> 01:56:07.340]  See, it's just like you can put up Obama posters on power poles that are worshipping him, it's fine, but you put them up against him, felony charges they're talking about with the state attorney general in Florida against a teenager.
[01:56:10.762 --> 01:56:18.624]  We got a guest coming up for about 20-30 minutes, and I'm told he's going to be with us via video feed, so that'll be good, too, for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[01:56:18.624 --> 01:56:29.447]  I do want to encourage people out there to financially support this radio show by supporting our sponsors, our advertisers, and also by buying the books and videos available at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:31.181 --> 01:56:37.926]  And we've got them in all sizes with the Obama Fascist, ObamaInfoWars.com, Obama New World Order.
[01:56:37.926 --> 01:56:41.909]  Soon, I guess they'll say you can't wear the t-shirt either and try to felony charge you.
[01:56:41.909 --> 01:56:46.852]  But the point is, it's got in the fat on the back or stop the criminal on the back.
[01:56:46.852 --> 01:56:50.055]  They also have a George Bush version of the shirt, bipartisan.
[01:56:50.055 --> 01:56:53.737]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:53.737 --> 01:56:58.541]  We've got a lot of things we want to do around the office here and we know the economy is going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:56:59.221 --> 01:57:03.406]  And I get busy and don't even really plug the bookstore, but that's how we fund our operation.
[01:57:03.406 --> 01:57:06.289]  Plus, it's the best material out there, bar none in my opinion.
[01:57:06.289 --> 01:57:08.391]  It's the best stuff I find and see and read.
[01:57:08.391 --> 01:57:10.894]  You know, we buy the books and videos I think are the best.
[01:57:10.894 --> 01:57:12.856]  And then, of course, my books and videos are there as well.
[01:57:12.856 --> 01:57:18.562]  It's all available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free
[01:57:20.555 --> 01:57:20.635]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:20.635 --> 01:57:20.735]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:20.735 --> 01:57:23.716]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at P.O.
[01:57:23.716 --> 01:57:25.017]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:57:25.017 --> 01:57:25.177]  P.O.
[01:57:25.177 --> 01:57:25.697]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:49.322]  And I want to thank everybody that has gotten the Obama Deception and the other books and videos.
[01:57:49.322 --> 01:57:50.583]  You really make it all possible.
[01:57:50.583 --> 01:57:53.024]  I want to thank my great team.
[01:57:53.024 --> 01:57:56.906]  And I want to thank everybody that's also PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:57:56.906 --> 01:58:03.469]  Remember, we simulcast with video clips and document cam and everything at least two hours a day, usually three hours like today.
[01:58:03.469 --> 01:58:04.330]  We're doing almost three hours.
[01:58:04.810 --> 01:58:10.212]  Simulcast of the four-hour show at PrisonPlanet.TV and all of this cost money to produce.
[01:58:10.212 --> 01:58:12.793]  We couldn't do it without the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[01:58:12.793 --> 01:58:21.437]  You can get a monthly membership for $5.95, a trial membership, or get a year membership and get three months for free.
[01:58:21.437 --> 01:58:23.838]  So again, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:58:23.838 --> 01:58:33.722]  But whatever you do, get the Obama deception, get in game the DVD at InfoWars, make copies, get it out to everybody, and get the censored Obama poster t-shirts.
[01:58:36.758 --> 01:58:40.251]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:40.251 --> 01:58:42.520]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:45.250 --> 01:58:50.451]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:58:50.451 --> 01:58:54.492]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:54.492 --> 01:59:00.394]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:00.394 --> 01:59:01.034]  It's true.
[01:59:01.034 --> 01:59:05.455]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:05.455 --> 01:59:11.777]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:59:11.977 --> 01:59:12.658]  Number 4.
[01:59:12.658 --> 01:59:15.560]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:19.223]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:19.223 --> 01:59:20.083]  Number 5.
[01:59:20.083 --> 01:59:23.926]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:59:23.926 --> 01:59:29.671]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long-time sponsor of ours.
[01:59:29.671 --> 01:59:32.753]  You can get more information at www.solutionsfromscience.com.

[01:59:36.134 --> 01:59:38.695]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[01:59:42.496 --> 01:59:50.458]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:50.458 --> 01:59:59.661]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:59.661 --> 02:00:00.261]  Big Brother.
[02:00:00.979 --> 02:00:02.741]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:02.741 --> 02:00:04.502]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:04.502 --> 02:00:06.084]  You want answers?
[02:00:06.084 --> 02:00:06.985]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:06.985 --> 02:00:11.829]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:11.829 --> 02:00:15.893]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:52.471]  Well, for the next 30 minutes or so, we're joined by Frederick Girton, then I'm going to go back to your phone calls, and a ton of news like the founder, the head of Greenpeace, coming out and saying that they lie about the ice sheets melting.
[02:00:52.471 --> 02:00:53.932]  See folks, the ice sheets
[02:00:56.181 --> 02:01:00.664]  On the North and South Pole, it gets smaller in the summer and then gets bigger in the winter.
[02:01:00.664 --> 02:01:02.485]  They do like this.
[02:01:02.485 --> 02:01:03.405]  Every year.
[02:01:03.405 --> 02:01:10.089]  We've put up the video, the satellite composites from NASA of the last, what, from 76 until now.
[02:01:10.089 --> 02:01:11.870]  Over 30 years of it.
[02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:14.252]  And you can see it every year doing this.
[02:01:14.252 --> 02:01:17.053]  Ice cap gets bigger in the winter, smaller in the summer.
[02:01:17.053 --> 02:01:18.734]  Bigger in the winter, smaller in the summer.
[02:01:18.734 --> 02:01:19.875]  Bigger in the winter.
[02:01:19.875 --> 02:01:23.177]  And the ice sheets are actually getting bigger than they were 30 years ago.
[02:01:23.177 --> 02:01:24.498]  Total, they're melting less.
[02:01:26.821 --> 02:01:30.002]  It's just, it's all, they say polar bears can't swim, folks.
[02:01:30.002 --> 02:01:30.862]  They tell the kids that.
[02:01:30.862 --> 02:01:34.063]  I mean, it's just, it's incredible.
[02:01:34.063 --> 02:01:38.024]  We've just got to get people to focus in on real issues.
[02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:51.327]  Now, I wanted to get Frederick Girton on the show with a WG film, and he made the film called Bananas.
[02:01:52.827 --> 02:02:04.374]  BananasTheMovie.com is the website, and he's a filmmaker based in Sweden, and so why not just go right to him and have him basically sum up what the film covers.
[02:02:04.374 --> 02:02:11.398]  I've seen it, I think it really covers some important issues, another snapshot of what's going on.
[02:02:11.398 --> 02:02:13.700]  Welcome to the Airwaves with us.
[02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:14.860]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:16.701]  Nice to be with you.
[02:02:16.701 --> 02:02:18.503]  Good to have you here with us.
[02:02:18.503 --> 02:02:20.424]  So tell us in a nutshell, as we're about to go to break,
[02:02:21.434 --> 02:02:32.902]  I've done a film that mainly follows a court case in Los Angeles where L.A.
[02:02:34.713 --> 02:02:54.009]  Attorney represents a big group of banana workers from Nicaragua and I follow this court case and they accuse the big banana company Dole for using banned pesticides and that their plaintiffs then get hurt by this, they get sterile.
[02:02:56.283 --> 02:03:06.689]  So I follow that case and it's a very interesting, I mean this is a legal battle that's been ongoing for many years, I just covered a little bit of this but I think at the same time
[02:03:07.588 --> 02:03:14.633]  When you see a court case like that, you can also see how these powers, how they work and how they look like.
[02:03:14.633 --> 02:03:31.084]  This story is about something that happened 30 years ago, when the big producer Dow Chemicals told their clients, please stop using this pesticide because our workers in our plant have got sterile.
[02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:41.091]  And all the other banana-producing companies stopped, but Dole, at that time standard fruit company, said, no, no, we want to continue to use this pesticide.
[02:03:42.086 --> 02:03:56.392]  And then they managed to get some kind of indemnity contract without chemicals and they imported 500,000 barrels more of pesticide to Nicaragua at that time.
[02:03:56.392 --> 02:04:00.093]  A pesticide that was by the EPA in the U.S.
[02:04:00.093 --> 02:04:03.575]  said don't use it and it was later also banned.
[02:04:03.575 --> 02:04:06.976]  What is the name of the pesticide?
[02:04:06.976 --> 02:04:08.137]  The chemical is called DBCP.
[02:04:09.807 --> 02:04:17.294]  It has some different product names called Nemagon or Fumazone.
[02:04:17.294 --> 02:04:24.920]  It was a huge story at the time when the US plant workers got sterile by this.
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:32.427]  But of course in every banana producing country they have problems with sterile workers.
[02:04:34.164 --> 02:04:36.046]  All right, stay there, Mr. Gretton.
[02:04:36.046 --> 02:04:38.347]  We're going to come right back to you from Sweden.
[02:04:38.347 --> 02:04:42.851]  Simulcasting, not just on the radio, but at PrisonPlanet.tv and Living Color.
[02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:51.674]  The issue too is the residue of this is in the bananas and American citizens ate it as well.
[02:04:51.674 --> 02:04:54.935]  And just so happens to sterilize you.
[02:04:54.935 --> 02:04:56.316]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:04:56.316 --> 02:04:58.317]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:04:58.317 --> 02:04:58.957]  Well, you should.
[02:04:58.957 --> 02:05:03.780]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:04.240]  That's right.
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:14.606]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:05:14.606 --> 02:05:21.951]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:05:21.951 --> 02:05:28.835]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:05:28.835 --> 02:05:34.038]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:05:34.358 --> 02:05:35.799]  This is real.
[02:05:35.799 --> 02:05:36.860]  Don't miss out.

[02:05:55.523 --> 02:05:58.525]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:58.525 --> 02:06:03.868]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:03.868 --> 02:06:05.909]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:05.909 --> 02:06:10.912]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:10.912 --> 02:06:11.833]  How much do you want?
[02:06:12.093 --> 02:06:13.214]  When do you want it?
[02:06:13.214 --> 02:06:15.096]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:15.096 --> 02:06:16.177]  When will you need it?
[02:06:16.177 --> 02:06:18.379]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:18.379 --> 02:06:19.720]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:21.242]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:21.242 --> 02:06:26.527]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:26.527 --> 02:06:30.110]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:30.110 --> 02:06:33.574]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:33.914 --> 02:06:35.135]  How much will you need?
[02:06:35.135 --> 02:06:36.036]  We don't know.
[02:06:36.036 --> 02:06:37.137]  How much do you want?
[02:06:37.137 --> 02:06:38.078]  All you can get.
[02:06:38.078 --> 02:06:39.159]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:39.159 --> 02:06:42.222]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:42.222 --> 02:06:43.984]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:43.984 --> 02:06:44.904]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:54.488 --> 02:06:59.795]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:06:59.795 --> 02:07:04.321]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:04.321 --> 02:07:06.604]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:06.604 --> 02:07:08.226]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:08.226 --> 02:07:09.268]  There is a solution.
[02:07:09.488 --> 02:07:17.917]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:08:00.279 --> 02:08:05.121]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:05.121 --> 02:08:06.681]  You want answers?
[02:08:06.681 --> 02:08:08.022]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:08.022 --> 02:08:12.443]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.443 --> 02:08:16.525]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:27.639 --> 02:08:30.040]  Alright my friends, we are back live.
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:34.700]  8 minutes 30 seconds into this third hour.
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:40.662]  Going back to Frederick Gretton who made the film Bananas, the movie.
[02:08:40.662 --> 02:08:46.043]  And this is just another example of where they know a pesticide is sterilizing the people.
[02:08:46.043 --> 02:08:52.724]  Just like they knew Agent Orange was sterilizing people, causing birth defects, causing all these cancers.
[02:08:52.724 --> 02:08:53.784]  Bayer Pharmaceutical
[02:08:55.339 --> 02:09:05.305]  Knowingly, for a decade plus, knew that all their factor 8 had HIV and Hepatitis in it, and that it was a death sentence for those that got the shot.
[02:09:05.305 --> 02:09:08.427]  And their own documents in court just admitted it.
[02:09:08.427 --> 02:09:08.947]  Don't care.
[02:09:08.947 --> 02:09:13.910]  And they can even put this on national news and nobody gets in trouble.
[02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:20.654]  So that's why we're taking another snapshot to look at this and talk about issues that people in Latin America should really be concerned about.
[02:09:20.654 --> 02:09:23.916]  By the way, it just came out that that coup in Nicaragua
[02:09:24.758 --> 02:09:26.479]  Turned out again it was the CIA.
[02:09:26.479 --> 02:09:27.499]  It's now admitted.
[02:09:27.499 --> 02:09:31.941]  Meanwhile, you always have Obama saying, we're against this coup, we're not involved.
[02:09:31.941 --> 02:09:34.603]  Turns out the CIA ran the whole thing.
[02:09:34.603 --> 02:09:36.003]  It just never ends with these people.
[02:09:36.003 --> 02:09:45.908]  I mean, they just lie, but even I, who intellectually know they're liars, still have trouble dealing with their level of duplicity and the things they do.
[02:09:45.908 --> 02:09:47.769]  And they do it in our name, folks.
[02:09:47.769 --> 02:09:50.990]  Going back to the director of this film, Frederick Gretton.
[02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:52.451]  Frederick, continue with
[02:09:54.878 --> 02:10:02.744]  Give us a snapshot of the story of what happened in the court case and the film and where this is today.
[02:10:02.744 --> 02:10:07.748]  Well, it is, of course, a very complex story.
[02:10:07.748 --> 02:10:11.411]  I mean, I followed the very first court case in the U.S.
[02:10:11.411 --> 02:10:11.631]  court.
[02:10:13.717 --> 02:10:24.925]  These big companies, Dole and Dow Chemicals, are lost in the Nicaraguan court and they were ordered to pay a lot of like 500 billion dollars and of course they never did it.
[02:10:24.925 --> 02:10:34.512]  But this was the first case in a US court and this very first one that I cover, Dole is fined guilty on malice.
[02:10:35.975 --> 02:10:44.743]  In five cases of knowingly sterilizing people with this pesticide, so they actually lose.
[02:10:44.743 --> 02:10:59.736]  Even if they win in some cases, because you really have to prove that every plaintiff got hurt and they were not successful at all, but with five of these plaintiffs, the jury found Dole guilty with malice.
[02:11:00.868 --> 02:11:07.110]  But then, in the same court, there were also a new group of workers coming up.
[02:11:07.110 --> 02:11:13.773]  And Dole then kicked out their attorneys and brought in a new and bigger, more aggressive firm.
[02:11:13.773 --> 02:11:28.438]  And they have been very successful by producing evidence in Nicaragua that says that the American plaintiff lawyers and the Nicaraguan judicial system is corrupt and that they did a lot of
[02:11:29.689 --> 02:11:32.571]  You know, fraud things.
[02:11:32.571 --> 02:11:41.377]  But the problem is proving the witnesses who says this was a fraud in court are all so-called John Doe witnesses.
[02:11:41.377 --> 02:11:47.862]  So it's very hard for us as citizens or journalists or filmmakers to really know what is what.
[02:11:47.862 --> 02:11:52.084]  Because if it's John Doe witnesses, how can I check the sources?
[02:11:52.084 --> 02:11:53.725]  It's very hard.
[02:11:53.725 --> 02:11:56.807]  And all this accusation against the plaintiff lawyers
[02:11:57.728 --> 02:11:57.808]  It's
[02:12:09.324 --> 02:12:21.827]  was presiding the first case has cancelled all the other Nicaraguan cases and accused the attorney in this case for fraud.
[02:12:21.827 --> 02:12:24.828]  So at the same time our film is finished.
[02:12:24.828 --> 02:12:28.829]  We were about to premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival.
[02:12:30.205 --> 02:12:36.329]  Dole brings our film trailer, the trailer you can find on our website, thebananasthemovie.com.
[02:12:36.329 --> 02:12:41.852]  This very trailer, they take to the judge and they ask her to stop the film.
[02:12:41.852 --> 02:12:47.816]  And when she refuses to do that, they send a so-called cease and desist letter to us.
[02:12:47.816 --> 02:12:53.880]  But not only to us, also to every single sponsor of the LA Film Festival.
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:58.183]  They didn't actually write to the film festival, they wrote to the sponsors of the film festival.
[02:12:58.843 --> 02:13:01.085]  Which is not really a fair thing to do.
[02:13:01.085 --> 02:13:03.627]  Oh, are you kidding?
[02:13:03.627 --> 02:13:11.353]  I have people attacking my family, lying about my family, calling sponsors, doing stuff at my house.
[02:13:11.353 --> 02:13:16.076]  I mean, this is how these people, you know, the same corporate system, this is how they operate.
[02:13:16.076 --> 02:13:19.099]  Terrorism is what these people do.
[02:13:19.099 --> 02:13:25.644]  Anybody who doubts this global corporate state just has to start fighting it to experience just how real it is.
[02:13:27.421 --> 02:13:43.746]  Yeah, I've actually got it into my family now, that's for sure, because after we screened the film in LA, they threatened to sue us all the way, but we all the time knew they hadn't seen the film.
[02:13:43.746 --> 02:13:48.708]  So we thought, I mean, all our lawyers said, come on, this film is balanced, they have nothing to sue us for.
[02:13:49.890 --> 02:13:58.413]  And we showed a film, there were like 10 lawyers on Dole in the theater, including the vice president of Dole was in the theater.
[02:13:58.413 --> 02:14:08.056]  And I gave them a speech of an open America that where you, I mean, I think that all kind of voices is important in society.
[02:14:08.056 --> 02:14:11.157]  Also the voice of a documentary filmmaker.
[02:14:11.897 --> 02:14:23.607]  Because even in our trailer, at our webpage, it's placed on a place called Vimeo, and there's a sponsored link close to our trailer.
[02:14:23.607 --> 02:14:25.089]  Guess who sponsored the link?
[02:14:25.089 --> 02:14:26.430]  Dole, of course.
[02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:33.336]  So wherever people can write, if people Google our film, they will find a sponsored link from Dole.
[02:14:33.336 --> 02:14:37.900]  Which means that their voice is always out there, so why shouldn't ours be out there?
[02:14:39.641 --> 02:14:51.204]  So I thought, well, now they won't sue us, but of course they did, because somebody told me that if a big corporation like that threatened to sue, they have to do it, because otherwise they are not big boys.
[02:14:51.204 --> 02:14:51.744]  I don't know.
[02:14:51.744 --> 02:15:00.426]  I don't understand that mentality, but it's obviously how they think.
[02:15:00.426 --> 02:15:02.006]  So where is the suit going now?
[02:15:03.676 --> 02:15:09.101]  Oh, you know, before I had, I never had a personal lawyer before.
[02:15:09.101 --> 02:15:16.568]  I never, I didn't even know so much about lawyers, but now I'm learning a lot about American lawyers.
[02:15:16.568 --> 02:15:19.551]  And so right now we have a
[02:15:21.204 --> 02:15:26.690]  American lawyer representing us and preparing our defense.
[02:15:26.690 --> 02:15:31.935]  So I guess it will be filed quite soon to the court in Los Angeles.
[02:15:31.935 --> 02:15:35.779]  But I mean, you shouldn't ask me too much about it because I'm a filmmaker.
[02:15:35.779 --> 02:15:36.801]  I'm not a lawyer, you know.
[02:15:37.569 --> 02:15:43.652]  No, I understand, but I mean, that's the classic intimidation, just trying to keep you from distributing the film.
[02:15:43.652 --> 02:15:56.797]  I would tell your lawyers, you might want to look into counter-suing them for torturous interference, for trying to violate your civil rights, your First Amendment, because clearly, going over the film, it is balanced.
[02:15:56.797 --> 02:15:59.378]  These things did happen and did transpire.
[02:15:59.378 --> 02:16:02.800]  You're just covering a court case, so they're really trying to frustrate
[02:16:04.171 --> 02:16:06.232]  Uh, free speech.
[02:16:06.232 --> 02:16:11.794]  And so I think the best defense is a good offense.
[02:16:11.794 --> 02:16:12.755]  I mean, what are they claiming?
[02:16:12.755 --> 02:16:13.935]  Defamation in their suit?
[02:16:13.935 --> 02:16:17.037]  Or are they just trying to injunct?
[02:16:17.037 --> 02:16:19.418]  Defamation and slander, yeah.
[02:16:19.418 --> 02:16:22.539]  But they were found, as you said, guilty in court, right?
[02:16:22.539 --> 02:16:25.280]  Yes, and that's the court case we follow.
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:28.942]  And it's of course still valid, that sentence.
[02:16:30.058 --> 02:16:37.743]  That verdict, even if they are appealing it and we tell the audience that it's under appeal, of course, why shouldn't we?
[02:16:37.743 --> 02:16:53.594]  But I think the painful thing for Dole here is that their own CEO is in court, sitting and admitting that they actually did these bad things, that they used the pesticide that everybody else stopped using.
[02:16:53.594 --> 02:16:57.197]  And of course, if you have a
[02:16:58.578 --> 02:17:07.265]  A company selling goods that are supposed to be healthy and then your workers claim that they got harmed.
[02:17:07.265 --> 02:17:11.389]  It's, of course, complicated the image of the company.
[02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:12.950]  But that's not really my fault.
[02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:18.094]  I mean, also CNN did stories on this and LA Times did stories on this.
[02:17:18.094 --> 02:17:20.757]  Why didn't they sue them?
[02:17:20.757 --> 02:17:23.039]  So is your film now out and available?
[02:17:25.674 --> 02:17:26.514]  Not yet.
[02:17:26.514 --> 02:17:31.336]  I mean, it will for sure be available in the U.S.
[02:17:31.336 --> 02:17:33.097]  and in many other countries.
[02:17:33.097 --> 02:17:38.560]  We open theatrical in Sweden quite soon and we will certainly also go theatrical in the U.S.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:40.101]  and Canada and the U.K.
[02:17:40.101 --> 02:17:41.141]  and many other countries.
[02:17:41.141 --> 02:17:45.884]  There is a strong interest for this film from festivals and so on.
[02:17:45.884 --> 02:17:53.148]  Yeah, I would think in the end their attempt at bullying and violating your First Amendment will only backfire on them.
[02:17:53.148 --> 02:17:53.508]  But you know,
[02:17:54.990 --> 02:17:58.912]  Dole and before that United Fruit is an admitted basically a CIA company.
[02:17:58.912 --> 02:18:01.934]  It's not even really a real company from my research.
[02:18:01.934 --> 02:18:07.176]  I mean, it's really just a covert arm into Latin America and all of their assorted pasts.
[02:18:07.176 --> 02:18:14.980]  So, you know, you got a bunch of spooks over there that think they own all the rest of us.
[02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:19.242]  Now you talk about the film, how they knew it was sterilizing people.
[02:18:19.242 --> 02:18:22.564]  I mean, was that like a little added goody for them or what was it?
[02:18:24.008 --> 02:18:24.989]  Or do they just not care?
[02:18:39.424 --> 02:18:52.069]  Maybe they think, oh, well, we don't have that problem really here because that's part of their defense is saying that the level of pesticide sprayed on a plantation wasn't enough to make people sterile.
[02:18:52.069 --> 02:19:04.174]  But the problem is, of course, in a plantation is that people handle, you know, the used barrel, people bring them to make a stove at home and, you know, people do a lot of things with their barrels.
[02:19:04.174 --> 02:19:05.055]  Of course, people get
[02:19:06.565 --> 02:19:11.910]  I mean, not only the workers get close to this pest, but everybody gets it.
[02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:24.821]  It also gets in the water supply, but, you know, a big company's tried to sue people and say Agent Orange was not bad for you, and of course it came out it was, and there have been a lot of other poisons.
[02:19:24.821 --> 02:19:31.127]  And, you know, the issue here, I think, is this attack on your free speech, for me.
[02:19:33.365 --> 02:19:35.767]  We've got Frederick Gretton.
[02:19:35.767 --> 02:19:36.968]  Mr. Gretton, stay right there.
[02:19:36.968 --> 02:19:43.314]  We're going to come right back to you after this quick break and continue discussing the film Bananas.
[02:19:43.314 --> 02:19:47.698]  But it's like AKA Tommy Chong after the feds raided and stole all the DVDs.
[02:19:47.698 --> 02:19:49.439]  They just made the film 100 times bigger.
[02:19:49.439 --> 02:19:52.422]  So the boys at the CIA are probably just doing you a favor.
[02:19:56.257 --> 02:19:58.438]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[02:19:58.438 --> 02:20:05.561]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[02:20:05.561 --> 02:20:11.323]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anyway.

[02:20:57.293 --> 02:21:02.017]  It's Ron Paul's birthday and also Money Mom Day for Ron Paul's 2010 bid for U.S.
[02:21:02.017 --> 02:21:02.658]  Senate.
[02:21:02.658 --> 02:21:06.601]  I'm happy to report a very successful fundraiser at 12.30 p.m.
[02:21:06.601 --> 02:21:12.306]  Central Time and has already raised $471,667.

[02:21:21.573 --> 02:21:23.535]  And happy birthday to the Ron Paul family.
[02:21:25.666 --> 02:21:28.588]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:21:28.588 --> 02:21:31.210]  Mine found it, in precious metals.
[02:21:31.210 --> 02:21:35.053]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:21:35.053 --> 02:21:42.298]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[02:21:55.945 --> 02:22:01.749]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:01.749 --> 02:22:09.334]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:22:09.334 --> 02:22:15.499]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:15.859 --> 02:22:17.881]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:17.881 --> 02:22:20.383]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:20.383 --> 02:22:31.974]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:22:31.974 --> 02:22:33.655]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:33.655 --> 02:22:35.497]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:22:35.497 --> 02:22:41.743]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:22:55.595 --> 02:23:04.658]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[02:23:49.210 --> 02:23:50.372]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[02:23:50.372 --> 02:23:51.954]  In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry.
[02:24:10.970 --> 02:24:18.335]  Look, all I know about is the history of fruit companies in Guatemala and Nicaragua and all those countries.
[02:24:18.335 --> 02:24:28.261]  What I know about other companies and Agent Orange and the rest of it, I remember reading about Dole losing this suit.
[02:24:28.261 --> 02:24:34.585]  So, I mean, getting off that subject, I just can't imagine how they can sue you then when your film is about the trial.
[02:24:35.808 --> 02:24:38.311]  Unless this is only about pure intimidation.
[02:24:38.311 --> 02:24:44.720]  Have you talked to lawyers about countersuing Dole Fruit?
[02:24:47.100 --> 02:25:05.090]  I mean I have talked to loads of lawyers and of course many people recommend us to do that and of course we also think that they have been successful in making our lives a bit easier and also destroying partly the plans we had for the US because they will also be
[02:25:06.130 --> 02:25:12.395]  Successful, because I think they used this suing us as some kind of smokescreen.
[02:25:12.395 --> 02:25:20.382]  They transformed themselves from the guys who did bad things to suddenly to be the victims.
[02:25:20.382 --> 02:25:25.927]  So it's kind of a smart thing they do in that sense.
[02:25:25.927 --> 02:25:32.753]  Because, I mean, I didn't spray this pesticide, but suddenly I'm kind of a crook, you know?
[02:25:32.753 --> 02:25:34.054]  And it's a very strange feeling.
[02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:37.031]  Well, that's just how it works.
[02:25:37.031 --> 02:25:44.494]  The old World War II saying of fighter bombers, crews, was when you're over the target, you're getting the flack.
[02:25:44.494 --> 02:25:47.195]  So when you're over the target, you're going to be attacked.
[02:25:47.195 --> 02:25:48.795]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:25:48.795 --> 02:25:55.458]  I mean, have you had, like, women calling your wife up of your marriage saying that you've gotten them pregnant and stuff?
[02:25:55.458 --> 02:25:58.059]  Or have you had people hang dead animals on your door yet?
[02:25:59.258 --> 02:26:01.019]  No, no, no, no.
[02:26:01.019 --> 02:26:02.900]  It's still very decent.
[02:26:02.900 --> 02:26:07.822]  I wouldn't say the nice folks at Dole would do something like that.
[02:26:07.822 --> 02:26:10.823]  I'm just saying that's the kind of stuff that we've had over the years.
[02:26:10.823 --> 02:26:16.946]  And, you know, if you just let folks know you enjoy it, please give you more, then it loses the fun.
[02:26:16.946 --> 02:26:21.448]  It's almost like at a psychic level these people do this.
[02:26:21.448 --> 02:26:25.550]  But specifically, though, in the court case, specifically
[02:26:26.850 --> 02:26:31.175]  They found that this did knowingly sterilize them?
[02:26:31.175 --> 02:26:34.057]  That's the verdict from the jury in LA, yes.
[02:26:34.057 --> 02:26:36.760]  That they knowingly sterilized people.
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:42.046]  I mean, they were found guilty on malice by this jury.
[02:26:42.046 --> 02:26:43.927]  And malice means you did it meanly.
[02:26:43.927 --> 02:26:45.809]  I mean, you knew you were doing it.
[02:26:45.809 --> 02:26:46.230]  Exactly.
[02:26:46.636 --> 02:26:54.241]  You're not just liable for accidentally using something that you're culpable to pay for now.
[02:26:54.241 --> 02:26:56.923]  So this came out in court, didn't it?
[02:26:56.923 --> 02:26:59.145]  They knowingly did it!
[02:26:59.145 --> 02:27:01.546]  Yes, yes it did.
[02:27:01.546 --> 02:27:06.129]  So of course that's something they want to create a big smokescreen around.
[02:27:06.129 --> 02:27:13.374]  And suddenly there is some kind of debate on a filmmaker who is doing an unfair film.
[02:27:14.545 --> 02:27:18.666]  So that's kind of a way of, you know, putting a spotlight somewhere else.
[02:27:18.666 --> 02:27:26.348]  You know, and what is, I mean, the spotlight should of course be on their deeds and how they, how they don't fulfill.
[02:27:26.348 --> 02:27:28.509]  I mean, these are their, their former workers.
[02:27:28.509 --> 02:27:29.649]  They should take care of them.
[02:27:29.649 --> 02:27:33.470]  If they, if they did a mistake, they should try to make good again.
[02:27:33.470 --> 02:27:36.931]  I think any, any good corporation should do that.
[02:27:36.931 --> 02:27:38.392]  And, and they haven't.
[02:27:38.392 --> 02:27:43.133]  Well, reading from the Los Angeles judge who found a pervasive conspiracy
[02:27:44.551 --> 02:27:45.732]  to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:27:56.334 --> 02:28:11.267]  Margaret Jangard to revise the film Bananas to show that the lawsuit against Dole was thrown out in April by a Los Angeles judge who found a pervasive conspiracy to defraud U.S.
[02:28:11.267 --> 02:28:13.989]  courts by plaintiff's attorneys and Nicaraguan judges.
[02:28:13.989 --> 02:28:15.891]  But you're saying the court case was won?
[02:28:17.475 --> 02:28:22.936]  The course case I followed was won and that is still under appeal.
[02:28:22.936 --> 02:28:32.118]  She talks about the second and third... Her findings in court is about other cases.
[02:28:32.118 --> 02:28:40.559]  And then she made some... She talked a little bit in court about that maybe also this case I followed could also have been fraudulent.
[02:28:40.559 --> 02:28:42.640]  But this case, all these plaintiffs
[02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:54.565]  Dole had more than two years of checking everything, and testing them, and you know, finding out a lot of things, and they didn't find all these things.
[02:28:54.565 --> 02:28:59.327]  So, I mean, and I'm just telling that story.
[02:28:59.327 --> 02:29:02.468]  And of course, then I update my viewers about what happened afterwards.
[02:29:02.468 --> 02:29:04.149]  You've seen the film, so you know that.
[02:29:04.149 --> 02:29:04.509]  Yeah.
[02:29:04.509 --> 02:29:08.071]  Well, no, look, I'm no fan of Dole, and I certainly think a lot of these pesticides,
[02:29:09.161 --> 02:29:15.205]  Need to be looked into, and I know that these fruit companies have a really sordid history down in Latin America.
[02:29:15.205 --> 02:29:21.009]  And we also know judges a lot of times will engage in political activities.
[02:29:21.009 --> 02:29:29.735]  But I really do appreciate you coming on the show, and I hope to have you back up once the film is in stores and on television so people can see it.
[02:29:31.056 --> 02:29:34.619]  Our guest, of course, is the maker of the film Bananas.
[02:29:34.619 --> 02:29:37.762]  We're going to come back on the other side in about five more minutes with our guest.
[02:29:37.762 --> 02:29:46.011]  Let him finish up any other comments he's got to make about the film.
[02:29:46.011 --> 02:29:47.412]  We're on the march.
[02:29:47.412 --> 02:29:49.935]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:49.935 --> 02:29:52.618]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.043 --> 02:29:59.287]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:29:59.287 --> 02:30:01.289]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:01.289 --> 02:30:09.818]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:09.818 --> 02:30:15.363]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:15.363 --> 02:30:16.985]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:17.205 --> 02:30:23.726]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:23.726 --> 02:30:34.789]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:34.789 --> 02:30:35.549]  That's right.
[02:30:35.549 --> 02:30:38.109]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:30:38.109 --> 02:30:39.710]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:42.271]  We're good to go.
[02:30:54.909 --> 02:30:56.291]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:30:56.291 --> 02:30:58.273]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:30:58.273 --> 02:30:58.934]  Well, you should.
[02:30:58.934 --> 02:31:03.759]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:31:03.759 --> 02:31:04.560]  That's right.
[02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:14.591]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:31:14.591 --> 02:31:15.733]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:31:15.933 --> 02:31:21.915]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:31:21.915 --> 02:31:28.796]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:31:28.796 --> 02:31:34.318]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:31:34.318 --> 02:31:35.778]  This is real.
[02:31:35.778 --> 02:31:36.838]  Don't miss out.
[02:31:36.838 --> 02:31:39.359]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course.
[02:31:39.659 --> 02:31:43.945]  Plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[02:31:43.945 --> 02:31:45.407]  And get your free handgun.
[02:31:45.407 --> 02:31:47.770]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[02:31:47.770 --> 02:31:51.475]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[02:31:51.475 --> 02:31:54.379]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[02:31:55.199 --> 02:32:00.404]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:32:00.404 --> 02:32:04.427]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:04.427 --> 02:32:10.333]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:10.333 --> 02:32:10.993]  It's true.
[02:32:10.993 --> 02:32:15.417]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:15.417 --> 02:32:15.918]  Number three,
[02:32:16.318 --> 02:32:22.624]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:32:22.624 --> 02:32:25.506]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:32:25.506 --> 02:32:30.031]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:30.031 --> 02:32:33.654]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:32:33.874 --> 02:32:39.617]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:32:39.617 --> 02:32:44.300]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:44.300 --> 02:32:46.081]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:46.081 --> 02:32:48.643]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[02:32:48.643 --> 02:32:51.284]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[02:33:06.744 --> 02:33:07.884]  It's Frederick Gerton.
[02:33:07.884 --> 02:33:10.085]  For some reason I can't get names straight today.
[02:33:10.085 --> 02:33:13.166]  Probably because I had three hours sleep last night.
[02:33:13.166 --> 02:33:16.926]  Flying in from a very important interview I did with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:33:16.926 --> 02:33:18.027]  He interviewed me.
[02:33:18.027 --> 02:33:19.907]  I interviewed him.
[02:33:19.907 --> 02:33:21.187]  So that was exciting.
[02:33:21.187 --> 02:33:22.268]  Did some other stuff.
[02:33:22.268 --> 02:33:25.048]  Other things we're working on.
[02:33:25.048 --> 02:33:26.889]  We'll announce the next few months.
[02:33:26.889 --> 02:33:33.390]  I will tell you there's a good chance Ventura's going to be in studio with us coming up the next month with some big announcements.
[02:33:33.390 --> 02:33:35.211]  That's Ivey's getting ready to go down to Mexico.
[02:33:36.021 --> 02:33:37.162]  He may end up just having to stay.
[02:33:37.162 --> 02:33:46.789]  Alright, I got a bunch of news in your phone calls coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:46.789 --> 02:33:56.497]  Going back to the filmmaker, Frederick, specifically though, they're not using this pesticide anymore for a reason.
[02:33:56.497 --> 02:33:58.579]  And this reminds me of the Merck.
[02:34:01.374 --> 02:34:01.554]  I don't
[02:34:22.768 --> 02:34:25.010]  Chemists were dying mysteriously.
[02:34:25.010 --> 02:34:29.354]  They said, oh, we meant figuratively to go to their homes and kill them.
[02:34:29.354 --> 02:34:32.397]  So, I mean, you have a lot of courage doing what you've done.
[02:34:32.397 --> 02:34:41.324]  And I think that's the strongest issue here is that you didn't do this with malice, whether you're 100 percent right or
[02:34:42.832 --> 02:34:47.454]  90% right that the court had ruled this.
[02:34:47.454 --> 02:34:49.755]  They'd already said stop using it.
[02:34:49.755 --> 02:34:52.856]  Dole was the last to be using it.
[02:34:52.856 --> 02:34:54.917]  These people believe they become sterile.
[02:34:54.917 --> 02:34:57.839]  There's a lot of evidence that pesticides do do that.
[02:34:57.839 --> 02:34:58.879]  And there it is.
[02:34:58.879 --> 02:34:59.980]  That's out of the Australian News.
[02:34:59.980 --> 02:35:01.080]  Just click on the link.
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:05.642]  Merck drew up a hit list of doctors to be neutralized.
[02:35:05.642 --> 02:35:10.104]  And we'll take you to the actual source article there by clicking on the entire article area.
[02:35:10.919 --> 02:35:13.780]  Because, I mean, this is the kind of stuff that goes on.
[02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:16.061]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:35:16.061 --> 02:35:26.045]  Now, I mean, can we tell your listeners, because it is kind of scary to be sued by a very big corporation.
[02:35:26.045 --> 02:35:30.687]  And, you know, here back in my country, I've been interviewed a lot of times.
[02:35:30.687 --> 02:35:35.989]  Every single journalist who has been writing about me has been contacted by Dolez.
[02:35:37.069 --> 02:35:38.569]  PR firm in Washington.
[02:35:38.569 --> 02:35:41.570]  So they're extremely active and they spend a lot of money.
[02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:45.651]  So my only way is to get out, is to get out like here.
[02:35:45.651 --> 02:35:48.091]  And also we have a Facebook group called Bananas.
[02:35:48.091 --> 02:35:50.812]  People can find that and be a member.
[02:35:50.812 --> 02:35:54.813]  And of course also find our web page, BananasTheMovie.com.
[02:35:54.813 --> 02:35:55.713]  It's very good.
[02:35:55.713 --> 02:36:02.254]  I mean, people who would like to support us, to join us, because then we, it's easier for us to reach out when we need to.
[02:36:02.254 --> 02:36:03.795]  Because we need friends.
[02:36:03.795 --> 02:36:05.315]  Because it is very
[02:36:06.175 --> 02:36:08.596]  It is scary, to be honest.
[02:36:08.596 --> 02:36:19.899]  Oh, you're going to be just fine as long as you don't let them intimidate you into coming out and saying that we should all bathe in the pesticide and that it should be added to the air and the oxygen.
[02:36:19.899 --> 02:36:25.280]  Carbon dioxide is bad, we must ban it, because it's what plants breathe, but we must all drink the poison.
[02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:35.824]  I mean, you know, hypothetically, uh, you know, I guess, I mean, they tried to, other companies tried to stop people exposing everything else, and so I think you're going to turn out just fine in the end of the day.
[02:36:35.824 --> 02:36:38.705]  I mean, they're not using the pesticide anymore.
[02:36:38.705 --> 02:36:44.647]  What is it they're saying about you that is supposedly, uh, that's so defamatory of them?
[02:36:44.647 --> 02:36:47.768]  I mean, are they being specific about what they're saying isn't true?
[02:36:50.193 --> 02:37:04.563]  I mean, the lawsuit is like 65 pages and of course it's many, many words from lawyers, you know, so it's very hard to put it in short.
[02:37:04.563 --> 02:37:06.624]  It's full of details that are not all true.
[02:37:12.248 --> 02:37:14.509]  So it is a bit tricky.
[02:37:14.509 --> 02:37:24.412]  I mean, the bottom line is that they don't like me to do the film because they think that the reality has changed since the film was finished.
[02:37:24.412 --> 02:37:27.173]  But they never contacted me in a friendly way.
[02:37:27.173 --> 02:37:30.534]  They were writing bullying letters from the first day.
[02:37:30.534 --> 02:37:35.076]  There have never been any kind of attempt to have a dialogue or something like that.
[02:37:35.076 --> 02:37:37.036]  They have just been attacking.
[02:37:37.036 --> 02:37:41.198]  But we still think that this film is totally valid and there is, I mean,
[02:37:42.580 --> 02:37:49.164]  It is a film that works, and it is valid, so they have nothing to come after, I think.
[02:37:49.164 --> 02:37:55.427]  Well, you know, they operate, these big fruit companies operate like gods in Central and South America.
[02:37:55.427 --> 02:37:58.789]  And, you know, it's the only source of income down there.
[02:37:58.789 --> 02:38:01.251]  It's just a labyrinthine.
[02:38:01.251 --> 02:38:05.994]  And so, that's how they try to operate here in the Western world as well.
[02:38:05.994 --> 02:38:11.477]  Okay, well, the website, again, for the Bananas movie, give that out for folks.
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:15.142]  So it's BananasTheMovie.com.
[02:38:15.142 --> 02:38:18.946]  BananasTheMovie.com and there's a Facebook group called Bananas.
[02:38:18.946 --> 02:38:20.547]  It's very good to join.
[02:38:20.547 --> 02:38:21.508]  Please.
[02:38:21.508 --> 02:38:24.411]  Okay, well we'll probably talk to you again as this develops and unfolds.
[02:38:24.411 --> 02:38:26.573]  Thank you so much for coming on the show with us.
[02:38:26.573 --> 02:38:27.394]  Thank you.
[02:38:27.394 --> 02:38:27.894]  Thanks.
[02:38:27.894 --> 02:38:28.635]  You better take care.
[02:38:28.635 --> 02:38:31.458]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:31.458 --> 02:38:34.240]  Okay.
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:37.003]  I've got a bunch of calls here that I want to go to.
[02:38:39.619 --> 02:38:45.322]  Why don't you give me a fresh list or is this a fresh list, John?
[02:38:45.322 --> 02:38:48.403]  It is a fresh list because I haven't taken calls in about 30-40 minutes.
[02:38:48.403 --> 02:39:07.052]  Let's go ahead and go to some of those phone calls and then we've got the guest coming up who had the AR-15 strapped to his back in Arizona that made international headlines as the domesticated population of the planet shook in fear at someone other than the police or military with a gun.
[02:39:08.707 --> 02:39:12.128]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Georgia.
[02:39:12.128 --> 02:39:13.449]  Tom, you're on the air.
[02:39:13.449 --> 02:39:17.410]  Hey Alex, God bless you and excellent prayer earlier.
[02:39:17.410 --> 02:39:22.492]  One of our biggest weapons, and I think we've got a pretty sharp one, is the sword.
[02:39:22.492 --> 02:39:28.474]  And remember what Jesus said, a house divided amongst itself cannot stand.
[02:39:28.474 --> 02:39:32.616]  While you were out yesterday, Kansas City, Missouri,
[02:39:34.121 --> 02:39:41.046]  No, I did see that.
[02:39:41.046 --> 02:39:46.270]  No, no, they're giving trial vaccines in Texas, Missouri, all 50 states.
[02:39:46.270 --> 02:39:48.512]  Main State Texas is where it started.
[02:39:48.512 --> 02:39:56.598]  And I read all the mainstream news articles where a large percentage are dying of brain degenerative disorder.
[02:39:56.598 --> 02:39:58.780]  I mean, they get paralyzed and die, quit breathing.
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:01.440]  And they tell the doctors, just be quiet.
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:04.441]  Don't, don't, just tell us quietly that they're dying.
[02:40:04.441 --> 02:40:06.181]  Keep it quiet.
[02:40:06.181 --> 02:40:09.122]  And it's just incredible.
[02:40:09.122 --> 02:40:13.163]  I have one question for your next guest, if you could maybe ask him.
[02:40:13.163 --> 02:40:14.723]  What is that 4409?
[02:40:14.723 --> 02:40:20.244]  I heard you on, you were mentioned on a talk show program last night.
[02:40:20.244 --> 02:40:24.585]  And they weren't talking real highly of you, but it was publicity all the same.
[02:40:24.585 --> 02:40:25.666]  And I'll listen for your answer.
[02:40:25.666 --> 02:40:26.426]  Hold on.
[02:40:26.426 --> 02:40:27.086]  What is what?
[02:40:28.867 --> 02:40:32.369]  Uh, 4409.
[02:40:32.369 --> 02:40:37.653]  They said something about 4409 program.
[02:40:37.653 --> 02:40:43.818]  Um, you know, maybe... It doesn't really ring a bell, and I was... What was it in context of?
[02:40:43.818 --> 02:40:45.099]  What were they saying it dealt with?
[02:40:45.099 --> 02:40:51.064]  Well, it was dealing with Chris about you and all your listeners are lunatics.
[02:40:51.064 --> 02:40:54.887]  You know, the same old rhetoric.
[02:40:54.887 --> 02:40:55.988]  Uh, what show was it?
[02:40:56.906 --> 02:40:58.408]  It was out of Atlanta.
[02:40:58.408 --> 02:40:59.128]  I don't even know.
[02:40:59.128 --> 02:41:00.370]  It was just some clowns.
[02:41:00.370 --> 02:41:02.932]  They didn't have much respect for them.
[02:41:02.932 --> 02:41:06.836]  Myself, personally, so... And what?
[02:41:06.836 --> 02:41:07.597]  They were... I mean... 4409?
[02:41:07.597 --> 02:41:11.041]  I don't under... I don't under... Uh-oh!
[02:41:11.041 --> 02:41:15.685]  Yeah, I... There's a YouTube video on it, but I didn't really... Oh, wait!
[02:41:15.685 --> 02:41:16.746]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[02:41:16.746 --> 02:41:19.329]  A guy was wearing a t-shirt that said 4409.
[02:41:21.184 --> 02:41:21.685]  I guess.
[02:41:21.685 --> 02:41:22.207]  I don't know.
[02:41:22.207 --> 02:41:29.625]  I just YouTubed it and it was some different things that you have, bits and pieces of a lot of your stuff from the past.
[02:41:31.736 --> 02:41:36.538]  I don't know if they were just saying that to throw off their bosses.
[02:41:36.538 --> 02:41:38.339]  No, no, no.
[02:41:38.339 --> 02:41:40.160]  It took me about a minute.
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:51.386]  Freedom's Phoenix, the active libertarian group that handed out over 30,000 DVDs of the Obama deception there at the university.
[02:41:52.848 --> 02:42:10.214]  They, one of the channels is called 4409, and yes, a guy is wearing an orange shirt that says that, so I was going 4409, 4409, and then quite a riddle, but I did, and my guys did pick it up, and they're doing a great job.
[02:42:10.214 --> 02:42:14.676]  My crew got it up on screen, so yes, that is what they're angry about.
[02:42:15.769 --> 02:42:22.432]  And I guess they're mad because I'm exposing how the Feds and the Senators are openly announcing they're getting ready to restrict free speech on the web.
[02:42:22.432 --> 02:42:25.053]  So I appreciate your call, Tom.
[02:42:25.053 --> 02:42:32.956]  By the way, up on PrisonPlanet.com, Paul Watson just did several more articles today.
[02:42:32.956 --> 02:42:41.719]  They are removing the ObamaFascist, ObamaInfoWars.com flyers all over Facebook, all over MySpace, all over Flickr.
[02:42:43.061 --> 02:42:49.446]  They do not allow the Obama Joker images that are on the t-shirts we sell and the free flyers we have at InfoWars.com.
[02:42:49.446 --> 02:43:00.915]  And see, somebody who hasn't gone public kind of altered another fellow's poster and put socialism under it and put it up on a few underpasses in California.
[02:43:00.915 --> 02:43:09.541]  And the media came out flipping out saying, this is racist, this is evil, this is bad, should they be arrested?
[02:43:09.541 --> 02:43:12.484]  And so I went on air and I said, was this two weeks ago?
[02:43:13.792 --> 02:43:17.696]  I said we're not going to allow ourselves to be intimidated.
[02:43:17.696 --> 02:43:21.200]  We're not going to allow them to go on the news and say socialism is the new n-word or whatever.
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:33.594]  We're going to have a contest in legal, lawful, commons areas where people put up handbills and things to go out and put these up.
[02:43:33.594 --> 02:43:35.136]  And now all over the country.
[02:43:36.468 --> 02:43:38.671]  And it's just very, very exciting.
[02:43:38.671 --> 02:43:47.341]  And it's got the feds hopping mad because other people think, wow, I can go out and put my message up on telephone poles or in commons areas.
[02:43:47.341 --> 02:43:50.464]  But what the police are saying is, look, you can put a garage sale up.
[02:43:50.464 --> 02:43:51.465]  You can put a pro-Obama.
[02:43:51.465 --> 02:43:53.127]  We're not going to make a deal out of that.
[02:43:53.127 --> 02:43:57.092]  We're going to flip out and basically call it terrorism if you criticize the president.
[02:43:58.749 --> 02:44:11.384]  And they got state attorney generals investigating and they're just flipping out because they're scared of not just taking over the town hall meetings, not just going to the press conferences, going to city councils, county commissioners, calling to talk radio.
[02:44:11.384 --> 02:44:15.048]  They are scared of you putting up posters.
[02:44:15.048 --> 02:44:17.951]  It's the equivalent of Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson
[02:44:18.857 --> 02:44:26.661]  And the printing press, for 10 years or more, before 1775, 1776, it really started in 1775, they just signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776, July 4th.
[02:44:26.661 --> 02:44:28.603]  People always email me going, 1775 dummy, it's 1776!
[02:44:28.603 --> 02:44:30.063]  1776 is the full declaration.
[02:44:30.063 --> 02:44:32.425]  Lexington and Concord are April 19th, 1775.
[02:44:32.425 --> 02:44:33.125]  But, side issue, the point is,
[02:44:48.996 --> 02:44:58.040]  That all of this is happening, all of this is going on.
[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:04.383]  And they are scared of this and then coming out trying to intimidate and scare people and now censoring it.
[02:45:07.807 --> 02:45:20.770]  Three days after I started this contest a few weeks ago, we had videos up there with tens of thousands of views that had gone on the main page of YouTube, and so YouTube went in and erased them saying they were racist.
[02:45:20.770 --> 02:45:26.851]  And the only thing in there was me saying, Obama as the Joker, nothing about his race.
[02:45:26.851 --> 02:45:35.653]  So the message is, you criticize him or you lampoon him, which is a totally American thing to do of any president.
[02:45:37.324 --> 02:45:40.028]  Ronald Reagan is this, as a vampire.
[02:45:40.028 --> 02:45:41.150]  George Bush is a devil.
[02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:42.753]  Bill Clinton is a demon.
[02:45:42.753 --> 02:45:44.816]  Bill Clinton is Pinocchio.
[02:45:44.816 --> 02:45:50.926]  They're saying you can't do this, and then they call racism, which injects race into the debate!
[02:45:52.904 --> 02:46:00.189]  But I want to commend all of you that have put the posters up and gotten them out, because you've done just an amazing thing.
[02:46:00.189 --> 02:46:06.713]  You've got Talk Radio Nationwide, Mainstream News, CNN, Fox, local TV stations.
[02:46:06.713 --> 02:46:08.114]  I mean, I can't even keep track of them.
[02:46:08.114 --> 02:46:14.158]  If you just search in the term Joker poster and click the news function of Google or Startpage.com or
[02:46:15.138 --> 02:46:19.380]  The other search engines that are out there, but Search Center News, you'll just see hundreds of stories.
[02:46:19.380 --> 02:46:23.361]  I mean, I don't have time making films and doing everything else to even track this.
[02:46:23.361 --> 02:46:28.963]  I've been trying, trying to judge all these videos.
[02:46:28.963 --> 02:46:38.506]  I think San Francisco's going to win, but I've got a bunch of videos in the inbox I've got to go over and make sure I make sure, because every time I think I've seen them all, I find more.
[02:46:39.870 --> 02:46:50.913]  So, it looks like San Francisco's gonna be announced the winner tomorrow, the fellas out in San Francisco, for their art direction.
[02:46:50.913 --> 02:46:56.974]  They're winning for their great art direction, the way they placed them, the style of the video editing.
[02:46:56.974 --> 02:47:02.496]  As I said, it would go off the number of posters and off the style and quality of the video.
[02:47:02.496 --> 02:47:06.517]  Though, you know, they didn't exactly follow the rules,
[02:47:08.322 --> 02:47:10.864]  Is that funny?
[02:47:10.864 --> 02:47:18.168]  It is somewhat funny they broke the rules and did sneak up right behind police repeatedly and post them right behind.
[02:47:18.168 --> 02:47:18.708]  But that's good.
[02:47:18.708 --> 02:47:19.949]  The cops see them doing it.
[02:47:19.949 --> 02:47:22.411]  It's so, everybody posts them all over San Francisco.
[02:47:22.411 --> 02:47:26.873]  I mean, truly a form of art, all the different posters and things that are up.
[02:47:26.873 --> 02:47:34.398]  I always like to take photographs myself when I'm traveling of like a wall with just tons of, you know, handbills put up on it.
[02:47:35.182 --> 02:47:38.323]  But the question is, a lot of cities don't have laws and rules against this.
[02:47:38.323 --> 02:47:43.083]  I've seen articles where newspapers are saying, our city doesn't have a law against handbills!
[02:47:43.083 --> 02:47:44.124]  Pass one now!
[02:47:44.124 --> 02:47:46.404]  Stop the joker!
[02:47:46.404 --> 02:48:01.747]  I mean, these local ninnies, and they are the minority, the control freaks, they are the minority of the people commenting or writing letters, but you see them in these articles saying, you know, we can't allow this, it's so scary, it's so awful.
[02:48:01.747 --> 02:48:02.987]  It's not bad
[02:48:04.332 --> 02:48:06.013]  To steal $23.7 trillion.
[02:48:06.013 --> 02:48:08.774]  It's not bad to kill 1,300,000 Iraqis.
[02:48:08.774 --> 02:48:15.716]  It's not bad that major vaccines have live cancer viruses in them, according to major German and British newspapers.
[02:48:15.716 --> 02:48:21.358]  It's not bad that the flu shots are killing large numbers of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome, admitted.
[02:48:21.358 --> 02:48:27.240]  It's not bad that any of this is happening.
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:29.841]  None of this is bad.
[02:48:29.841 --> 02:48:30.821]  None of this is a problem.
[02:48:35.581 --> 02:48:55.611]  All that matters is that we need to learn how to grovel and be good little slaves and not put a poster up.
[02:48:55.611 --> 02:48:59.433]  The message is, this is like terrorism, this is a hate crime, this is evil.
[02:49:00.765 --> 02:49:06.791]  So I want to challenge all the listeners to go absolutely wild, and if you haven't been part of the contest, the contest is over now.
[02:49:06.791 --> 02:49:11.515]  I'm going to finish judging it tonight and announce it tomorrow.
[02:49:11.515 --> 02:49:19.462]  But for the First Amendment, we are making some new versions of the Obama poster.
[02:49:19.462 --> 02:49:25.708]  We are making versions that say don't drink the tap water, don't take the flu shot, and
[02:49:26.690 --> 02:49:28.812]  Because this is the image they say we can't post.
[02:49:28.812 --> 02:49:31.094]  This is the image they say we're not allowed to post.
[02:49:31.094 --> 02:49:35.398]  This is the image they're saying is taboo and bad and evil.
[02:49:35.398 --> 02:49:38.621]  So please go to InfoWars.com, buy the t-shirts.
[02:49:38.621 --> 02:49:42.085]  It supports our operation, plus you get a great t-shirt.
[02:49:42.085 --> 02:49:43.886]  We've got it with Obama, Joker, Fascist.
[02:49:43.886 --> 02:49:45.788]  Obama, Joker, InfoWars.com.
[02:49:45.788 --> 02:49:47.590]  Obama, Joker, New World Order.
[02:49:49.716 --> 02:49:51.057]  It is all up there.
[02:49:51.057 --> 02:49:54.941]  It is all available for everybody.
[02:49:54.941 --> 02:49:57.783]  And again, you can see the t-shirts on the website.
[02:49:57.783 --> 02:49:58.944]  I wore a couple of them last week.
[02:49:58.944 --> 02:50:00.726]  We have them all in stock.
[02:50:00.726 --> 02:50:03.248]  All sizes, all major sizes up to XX.
[02:50:03.248 --> 02:50:06.331]  I think we even have some XXX.
[02:50:06.331 --> 02:50:07.792]  We have some really big ones in there.
[02:50:11.118 --> 02:50:15.641]  Medium, small, you name it, all available at Infowars.com.
[02:50:15.641 --> 02:50:18.243]  Wake up before it's too late, Infowars.com on the back.
[02:50:18.243 --> 02:50:20.064]  Stop the criminal, Infowars.com on the back.
[02:50:20.064 --> 02:50:24.627]  And then of course, In The Fed is also on the back of some of the shirts.
[02:50:24.627 --> 02:50:28.970]  And I think I'm going to sell the shirts I've got of this and have it be like a limited time deal.
[02:50:28.970 --> 02:50:35.134]  I don't know, we're juggling that because we're getting such a huge t-shirt.
[02:50:36.291 --> 02:50:38.713]  We got like 50 different t-shirts or more now?
[02:50:38.713 --> 02:50:41.916]  We don't really have the warehouse space to have all these different versions.
[02:50:41.916 --> 02:50:46.361]  I'm thinking we might start doing limited runs of t-shirts.
[02:50:46.361 --> 02:50:47.382]  But, who knows?
[02:50:47.382 --> 02:50:52.387]  The point is, get it today, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWars.com with all the books and videos.
[02:50:52.387 --> 02:50:53.828]  You're having an effect out there.
[02:50:53.828 --> 02:50:54.489]  I salute you!
[02:50:55.725 --> 02:50:57.106]  We're good to go.

[02:51:57.296 --> 02:52:00.138]  A new world order.
[02:52:00.138 --> 02:52:05.020]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:52:05.020 --> 02:52:07.801]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:52:07.801 --> 02:52:09.982]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[02:52:10.643 --> 02:52:13.805]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:52:13.805 --> 02:52:21.131]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:52:24.158 --> 02:52:29.602]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:52:33.464 --> 02:52:36.046]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:52:36.046 --> 02:52:37.207]  Most people have no idea.
[02:52:37.207 --> 02:52:37.987]  They're not after money.
[02:52:37.987 --> 02:52:39.268]  They have all the money they need.
[02:52:39.268 --> 02:52:40.249]  They're after power.
[02:52:40.249 --> 02:52:41.390]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:52:50.896 --> 02:52:52.917]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[02:52:52.917 --> 02:52:54.078]  You have been warned.
[02:52:54.978 --> 02:53:02.120]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[02:53:02.120 --> 02:53:18.325]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[02:53:18.325 --> 02:53:23.467]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[02:53:23.687 --> 02:53:30.210]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[02:53:30.210 --> 02:53:34.091]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[02:53:34.091 --> 02:53:36.793]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[02:53:36.793 --> 02:53:42.155]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[02:53:42.475 --> 02:53:45.138]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:53:45.138 --> 02:53:47.361]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.

[02:54:17.770 --> 02:54:19.170]  Aha!
[02:54:19.170 --> 02:54:20.551]  I am back!
[02:54:20.551 --> 02:54:25.072]  I come in here and unceremoniously flop down.
[02:54:25.072 --> 02:54:32.633]  You know, I'm gonna come back tonight and video edit, working on the film, but I'm gonna go to sleep as soon as this radio show is over.
[02:54:32.633 --> 02:54:35.594]  Isn't that an exciting thing for a radio host to come on here?
[02:54:35.594 --> 02:54:39.254]  This show is so exciting, I'm gonna go to sleep!
[02:54:39.254 --> 02:54:42.615]  No, I worked real hard while I was in Los Angeles for one day.
[02:54:43.780 --> 02:54:51.281]  And I didn't get a lot of sleep last night, and usually if I'm... I can even do coast-to-coast AM, be up until four in the morning, get three hours sleep, feel fine.
[02:54:51.281 --> 02:54:55.862]  Today, I am just beat to... You know what?
[02:54:55.862 --> 02:55:00.643]  I am just... If I was one of the seven dwarfs, I'd be sleepy.
[02:55:00.643 --> 02:55:02.143]  Let's pull up one of the seven dwarfs.
[02:55:02.143 --> 02:55:06.964]  Sleepy, one of the seven dwarfs, and look at him.
[02:55:06.964 --> 02:55:09.805]  Did folks see the video that's up on the websites?
[02:55:10.976 --> 02:55:13.098]  of the La Reconquista, reconquered the U.S.
[02:55:13.098 --> 02:55:34.314]  crowd at a town hall, physically attacking and having to be arrested by police, just peaceful town haulers, because they see Obama as their president, they see him as opening up the borders, and as the one that's going to send the gringos home, but then they were also screaming the N-word over and over again.
[02:55:37.418 --> 02:55:43.820]  Very, very, very scary stuff because we don't need this as a society.
[02:55:43.820 --> 02:55:45.541]  There I am.
[02:55:45.541 --> 02:55:47.341]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:47.341 --> 02:55:51.683]  Ladies and gentlemen, there I am.
[02:55:51.683 --> 02:55:55.764]  You know, the problem is as soon as I get off air though, I'm like in this cycle, then I won't be sleepy.
[02:55:55.764 --> 02:55:58.085]  You know what I mean?
[02:55:58.085 --> 02:55:59.225]  It's not even sleepy.
[02:55:59.225 --> 02:56:03.987]  I'm like super relaxed.
[02:56:03.987 --> 02:56:04.207]  And, uh,
[02:56:07.788 --> 02:56:08.269]  I don't know.
[02:56:08.269 --> 02:56:12.113]  I don't know.
[02:56:12.113 --> 02:56:14.456]  And I've just got so much work coming up.
[02:56:14.456 --> 02:56:17.419]  I'm just pontificating here on air.
[02:56:17.419 --> 02:56:17.940]  Look at this.
[02:56:17.940 --> 02:56:26.930]  Yeah, it's all over the news that they're vaccinating school kids and little babies and pregnant women when squalene is admitted.
[02:56:28.476 --> 02:56:33.538]  Chemicals they put in here to cause even bigger autoimmune responses in pregnant women and children.
[02:56:33.538 --> 02:56:34.999]  I mean, look at this article.
[02:56:34.999 --> 02:56:37.861]  Swine flu jab linked to killer nerve disease.
[02:56:37.861 --> 02:56:48.986]  Leaked letter reveals concern of neurologists over 25 deaths in America just in the swine flu test in Texas.
[02:56:48.986 --> 02:56:51.847]  And how to keep it quiet, how the people are dying.
[02:56:51.847 --> 02:56:53.008]  Let's take some phone calls.
[02:56:53.008 --> 02:56:55.169]  Then we've got the fella coming on at the aid after.
[02:56:56.502 --> 02:57:00.483]  Hey Alex, I had a possible scenario concerning this swine flu pandemic.
[02:57:00.483 --> 02:57:01.783]  Say we do get the word out.
[02:57:01.783 --> 02:57:03.444]  Say we do stop people from getting the vaccination.
[02:57:24.645 --> 02:57:46.020]  Um, then, or the most majority of Americans don't take it, then do you think that they would come back and possibly release another swine flu or something more deadlier, and then say, oh, see, it's your guys' fault for not taking the vaccination, you should have done this, and then try to enforce their agenda that way?
[02:57:47.028 --> 02:57:55.373]  They're capable of doing anything, because they believe killing us and reducing our numbers is a good thing, that we're parasites, and so why not get rid of us?
[02:57:55.373 --> 02:58:03.037]  And so, because that's their worldview, and they've staged terror attacks, they've done so many other horrible things, the sky's the limit.
[02:58:03.037 --> 02:58:13.443]  And yes, they could, and many experts we've had on have said that, release something that kills a bunch of people, to panic the population into taking the soft kill weapon.
[02:58:16.491 --> 02:58:23.154]  Okay, I was kind of saying, we're most sore of... I know, so what do we do about that possibility?
[02:58:23.154 --> 02:58:27.315]  I mean, all we can do is say, this vaccine's killing people like we said it would.
[02:58:27.315 --> 02:58:30.657]  Why are they pushing to have everybody take it?
[02:58:30.657 --> 02:58:31.697]  What else is in there?
[02:58:31.697 --> 02:58:37.400]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:39.981]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:46.001 --> 02:58:49.003]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:49.003 --> 02:58:54.328]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:54.328 --> 02:58:56.389]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:58:56.389 --> 02:59:01.393]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:01.393 --> 02:59:02.294]  How much do you want?
[02:59:02.554 --> 02:59:03.675]  When do you want it?
[02:59:03.675 --> 02:59:05.557]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:05.557 --> 02:59:06.637]  When will you need it?
[02:59:06.637 --> 02:59:08.839]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:08.839 --> 02:59:10.180]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:10.180 --> 02:59:11.722]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:11.722 --> 02:59:16.986]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:16.986 --> 02:59:20.569]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:20.569 --> 02:59:24.032]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:24.372 --> 02:59:25.592]  How much will you need?
[02:59:25.592 --> 02:59:26.513]  We don't know.
[02:59:26.513 --> 02:59:27.613]  How much do you want?
[02:59:27.613 --> 02:59:28.533]  All you can get.
[02:59:28.533 --> 02:59:29.634]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:29.634 --> 02:59:32.675]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:32.675 --> 02:59:33.195]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:33.195 --> 02:59:34.876]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:34.876 --> 02:59:35.876]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:35.876 --> 02:59:37.096]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:37.096 --> 02:59:38.917]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:59.224 --> 02:59:59.324]  Yeah.
[03:00:25.265 --> 03:00:31.511]  More and more, I'm just on air talking to the guests that are coming up while I'm on video.
[03:00:31.511 --> 03:00:34.854]  Everybody watching on the internet is wondering, what is he talking about?
[03:00:34.854 --> 03:00:38.278]  I was telling our guests we're coming to you at the 5 after.
[03:00:38.278 --> 03:00:40.380]  Get the lip readers in there.
[03:00:40.380 --> 03:00:43.242]  Jones is saying he really is a reptoid.
[03:00:43.242 --> 03:00:47.066]  We have the proof.
[03:00:47.066 --> 03:00:49.729]  I saw some really funny website last week.
[03:00:51.004 --> 03:01:01.992]  The newest conspiracy is that I am a blood-drinking reptoid from the planet Pop-Tart, so I've now been officially found out, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:01.992 --> 03:01:06.376]  Okay, I do have a big news bulletin coming up in about 30 minutes.
[03:01:06.376 --> 03:01:13.181]  We're going to go over a host of issues, some really important issues.
[03:01:13.181 --> 03:01:18.164]  The head of Greenpeace admitting they lie about the ice sheets in Greenland and the Arctic.
[03:01:19.153 --> 03:01:20.974]  Saying that they're disappearing.
[03:01:20.974 --> 03:01:22.134]  That's a complete lie.
[03:01:22.134 --> 03:01:25.436]  They're the same size they were if not bigger 30 years ago.
[03:01:25.436 --> 03:01:32.159]  They get smaller in the summer, bigger in the winter, smaller in the summer, bigger in the winter.
[03:01:32.159 --> 03:01:33.460]  Just like Mars has a
[03:01:35.723 --> 03:01:51.808]  Seasonal system to and it's ice caps get bigger and smaller depending on how close it is to that big hot ball called the Sun Going back to Mookie I like that name Mookie going back to Mookie in Colorado Mookie
[03:01:53.874 --> 03:02:08.002]  Yes, we have made the point, and you're making it now, that if people don't take the flu shot, the establishment could release some other, even stronger flu, and that may be what they're planning, the way they're building up and hyping and getting all these assets in line.
[03:02:09.159 --> 03:02:12.060]  And I think I'll cover that before the show ends.
[03:02:12.060 --> 03:02:18.964]  Paul Watson has another huge confirmed mainstream news report where they admit they're building mass graves and incinerators.
[03:02:18.964 --> 03:02:21.925]  Now I was telling people that years ago and got laughed at.
[03:02:21.925 --> 03:02:27.348]  All I was doing was reading executive orders from the states and the federal government and other countries.
[03:02:27.348 --> 03:02:30.849]  So yes, this whole police state is built around pandemics.
[03:02:30.849 --> 03:02:35.952]  We know the government's been caught, these eugenicists, releasing pandemics over and over again.
[03:02:38.635 --> 03:02:40.196]  I don't know.
[03:02:40.196 --> 03:02:43.338]  I just know they've got... I've never seen such a buildup in assets.
[03:02:43.338 --> 03:02:45.119]  The establishment needs this.
[03:02:45.119 --> 03:02:50.922]  Governors' associations are saying they don't want 400,000 troops on the streets, that some type of takeover's happening.
[03:02:50.922 --> 03:02:55.884]  Dick Armey says a takeover's happening and they could use a stage flu event.
[03:02:55.884 --> 03:02:59.306]  And that's a big, powerful, former Republican leader of the House.
[03:02:59.306 --> 03:03:02.448]  You've got current Congressman Ron Paul saying that on this show.
[03:03:02.448 --> 03:03:03.649]  You've got Congressman Brown.
[03:03:04.958 --> 03:03:08.141]  Saying the same thing.
[03:03:08.141 --> 03:03:23.073]  So the good news is we've gotten the word out about this and now we're really having a real debate about this and people now are having it introduced to their thought process that government stages things and that crises are used.
[03:03:23.073 --> 03:03:25.615]  And so that's what we're getting at here.
[03:03:25.615 --> 03:03:26.516]  But I mean, I don't know.
[03:03:26.516 --> 03:03:27.837]  What do you think is going to happen, Mookie?
[03:03:29.492 --> 03:03:44.346]  Um, well I think the media might try to bust up our credibility by saying, or blaming us for the outbreak that they supposedly say, you know, may come this winter or whatever.
[03:03:44.346 --> 03:03:47.028]  They would blame us for not taking the vaccination.
[03:03:47.861 --> 03:03:49.502]  Well, that's what Dr. Dean Adele does.
[03:03:49.502 --> 03:03:56.607]  I've heard him on the local radio station syndicated and he says, arrest parents that don't vaccinate their kids.
[03:03:56.607 --> 03:03:58.108]  Kick them out of school.
[03:03:58.108 --> 03:03:59.789]  They're endangering your child.
[03:03:59.789 --> 03:04:00.809]  Sue those parents.
[03:04:00.809 --> 03:04:03.091]  He tells other families to sue other families.
[03:04:03.091 --> 03:04:08.414]  If your kids had the hundreds of shots and the four shots Obama wants, not just three now, Dr. Obama,
[03:04:10.615 --> 03:04:11.576]  I don't know.
[03:04:25.709 --> 03:04:33.935]  And so they probably, a lot of evidence shows, mathematically know that there's going to be mutations from this flu shot that actually causes superflu.
[03:04:33.935 --> 03:04:43.082]  Just like AP reports, they're giving people all over the world the polio shot and it's killing them or getting them sick because it's mutating live in the body.
[03:04:43.082 --> 03:04:44.583]  So you make really good points.
[03:04:44.583 --> 03:04:47.005]  I mean, look, we're going to find out in the next few months.
[03:04:47.005 --> 03:04:52.789]  If we get the word out in a big enough way, the establishment may back off and not do this though.
[03:04:55.265 --> 03:04:59.509]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:04:59.509 --> 03:05:01.511]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:05:01.511 --> 03:05:10.039]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:05:10.039 --> 03:05:15.584]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:05:15.584 --> 03:05:17.206]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:05:17.426 --> 03:05:23.951]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:05:23.951 --> 03:05:35.000]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:35.460]  That's right.

[03:06:00.447 --> 03:06:04.973]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:04.973 --> 03:06:07.256]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?

[03:07:26.062 --> 03:07:27.303]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:07:27.303 --> 03:07:31.846]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:07:31.846 --> 03:07:37.670]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:07:37.670 --> 03:07:41.312]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:07:41.312 --> 03:07:44.034]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:07:44.034 --> 03:07:49.097]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[03:07:49.097 --> 03:07:49.398]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:07:49.398 --> 03:07:50.739]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:08:01.905 --> 03:08:08.548]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:08.548 --> 03:08:22.034]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:22.034 --> 03:08:23.795]  Chris is his real
[03:08:25.865 --> 03:08:29.608]  First name, we're not going to say his last name for his own privacy.
[03:08:29.608 --> 03:08:36.173]  And we're going to put up some of the video images of him first before we play this Oberman hit piece.
[03:08:36.173 --> 03:08:48.122]  We're going to put up some of the images of Chris out there, clean cut, nice white shirt, black tie, with it strapped to his back, perfectly done.
[03:08:49.187 --> 03:08:59.948]  They would have really gone wild whether the gun had been in his hands or, you know, looking like he was aiming it, but it looked very military, very stowed away, very
[03:09:01.397 --> 03:09:14.647]  You know, well-kept, not some chubby guy saying, I'm the commander, I'm the real president of America, or I'm the Republic of Texas commander, and Heil Hitler, or something.
[03:09:14.647 --> 03:09:20.552]  Because the feds send those people out, they send them out to look stupid, to act stupid, they've been caught.
[03:09:20.552 --> 03:09:23.374]  I told you all those years that Hal Turner was FBI.
[03:09:24.415 --> 03:09:31.036]  It's come out in every major case that the major Klan groups and white supremacist groups are run by the FBI.
[03:09:31.036 --> 03:09:38.377]  And here's the Associated Press, that he was an agent provocateur, the FBI admits he was an informant, but saying he's not a provocateur for them.
[03:09:38.377 --> 03:09:47.199]  Look, there's no doubt that Turner was being handled by him and is now, like all their patsies, being set up.
[03:09:47.199 --> 03:09:52.600]  After his website got hacked and it came out that he was a Fed being ordered to cause problems,
[03:09:53.530 --> 03:09:56.112]  Remember we broke that a year ago?
[03:09:56.112 --> 03:09:58.354]  He became expendable.
[03:09:58.354 --> 03:10:03.618]  But the feds, through channels, have let us know they're coming after us for this.
[03:10:03.618 --> 03:10:20.331]  They are really angry that I've exposed the Southern Poverty Law Center for running McVeigh and being in control of the Elohim City compound with Oklahoma City when that cop killer who'd been attacking me, white supremacist... See, I don't like the things Israel's doing and the corrupt things they're involved in.
[03:10:21.257 --> 03:10:24.319]  But I know a lot of other countries are involved in evil, corrupt things as well.
[03:10:24.319 --> 03:10:29.902]  So just because I don't like the Zionist policies doesn't then mean I hate Jews.
[03:10:29.902 --> 03:10:38.908]  Or just like I don't like the La Reconquista folks that believe the Southwest belongs to Mexico, but it doesn't mean I dislike Hispanics.
[03:10:38.908 --> 03:10:42.991]  The establishment wants to radicalize everybody so we can't have a real debate.
[03:10:42.991 --> 03:10:49.495]  And they do the same thing with the Obama posters that they're now removing off Flickr and Facebook and Myspace.
[03:10:50.848 --> 03:10:53.629]  And those stories are up on Infowars.com right now.
[03:10:53.629 --> 03:10:57.249]  They're doing those same things.
[03:10:57.249 --> 03:11:01.830]  Saying that if you call Obama a socialist, that's code word for the n-word.
[03:11:01.830 --> 03:11:07.592]  Which then, folks hear that and think, oh my gosh, somebody must be racist if they're saying socialism.
[03:11:07.592 --> 03:11:11.813]  And people believe this if the media says it.
[03:11:11.813 --> 03:11:15.213]  So, this is the kind of stuff that's going on.
[03:11:15.213 --> 03:11:16.154]  And it's outrageous.
[03:11:16.154 --> 03:11:17.534]  And I tell you, it makes it even better
[03:11:18.356 --> 03:11:29.429]  That he's a clean-cut, well-spoken, and on top of it, a black man out there with his gun strapped to his back because they couldn't say racist militias were out there wanting to kill Obama.
[03:11:29.429 --> 03:11:34.594]  That's not why he was there, and he's going to explain why he was there with open carry.
[03:11:34.594 --> 03:11:36.417]  And Chris joins us from Arizona.
[03:11:36.417 --> 03:11:38.899]  He lives in Arizona, lives in Phoenix.
[03:11:39.520 --> 03:11:40.260]  Thanks, no problem.
[03:12:07.691 --> 03:12:09.572]  Well, you heard my little rant there.
[03:12:09.572 --> 03:12:12.554]  First off, why did you decide to do this?
[03:12:12.554 --> 03:12:16.437]  Tell us what it was like actually being there, you know, because this went on for hours.
[03:12:16.437 --> 03:12:22.201]  We just saw the snapshot of a few minutes of video from the Associated Press.
[03:12:22.201 --> 03:12:28.805]  I decided a long time ago that maybe I lost a lot of faith in the political process in America.
[03:12:28.805 --> 03:12:29.786]  I tried to get involved
[03:12:30.935 --> 03:12:48.648]  Uh, locally with the Arizona Republican Party, and seeing things from the inside, seeing how things operate, I realize that this whole machine, this left-right Democrat-Republican machine, is just a ploy to pit us against each other so that the winner is always the state, it's always the government.
[03:12:48.648 --> 03:12:55.072]  And I just, I think that voting and the political process isn't going to work anymore.
[03:12:55.072 --> 03:12:59.395]  And I think it's time for people to just actually stand up and say no to these things, that
[03:13:00.754 --> 03:13:08.325]  Well, absolutely, and you certainly did that in a loud and clear and decisive way.
[03:13:08.325 --> 03:13:13.672]  We've become so ninnied, so broken, so
[03:13:15.956 --> 03:13:35.419]  We've capitulated to hiding with our guns in our houses and now I'm sure you see the articles like I do where some old man's cleaning his gun in his garage in Texas or places where you think there's a second amendment and neighbors see it and get scared and the cops come and they see a gun safe with ten guns and a thousand rounds and they call it an arsenal and take it
[03:13:35.859 --> 03:13:36.620]  and arresting
[03:13:55.595 --> 03:13:58.476]  Carpet cleaner trying to call the cops.
[03:13:58.476 --> 03:14:18.283]  Back before I had children, I had a shotgun in my broadcast studio in my house, up on the wall, you know, in a gun rack, and the guy freaked out because he thought everything was based in television land, in the dramas he watches based in New York and Chicago, like NYPD Blue, where the cops come in and find a gun and arrest you.
[03:14:18.283 --> 03:14:21.905]  The public is so dumbed down, they think guns are illegal, but I'm ranting.
[03:14:21.905 --> 03:14:22.945]  I mean, give us your view on that.
[03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:24.540]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:14:24.540 --> 03:14:28.242]  If you were there that day, anyone that was around me all day long, you can do that.
[03:14:28.242 --> 03:14:28.802]  You can do that.
[03:14:28.802 --> 03:14:29.343]  You can do that.
[03:14:29.343 --> 03:14:30.063]  You can do that.
[03:14:30.063 --> 03:14:30.503]  I can't do that.
[03:14:30.503 --> 03:14:31.684]  Everybody's asking the police.
[03:14:31.684 --> 03:14:33.505]  You're just going to let him do that?
[03:14:33.505 --> 03:14:34.345]  That's why I'm there.
[03:14:34.345 --> 03:14:35.986]  Because people don't have a clue.
[03:14:35.986 --> 03:14:36.566]  They have no clue.
[03:14:40.290 --> 03:14:43.472]  Now, Oberman and others are trying to do the reverse now of what you're doing.
[03:14:43.472 --> 03:14:46.153]  They're saying, look, they do have guns right by the President.
[03:14:46.153 --> 03:14:47.234]  They want to kill him.
[03:14:47.234 --> 03:14:48.754]  They're white supremacists.
[03:14:48.754 --> 03:14:50.175]  Ban them!
[03:14:50.175 --> 03:14:55.638]  Because if they're able to do that, that's it for the Second Amendment.
[03:14:55.638 --> 03:14:57.699]  Yeah, well, not just if they're able to do that.
[03:14:57.699 --> 03:15:00.120]  If we're willing to let it happen.
[03:15:00.120 --> 03:15:03.262]  I mean, you can't just blame all these people that are coming after him.
[03:15:03.262 --> 03:15:04.943]  A lot of the responsibility is on us.
[03:15:04.943 --> 03:15:07.584]  I mean, we have to say no or they're going to run right over us.
[03:15:09.326 --> 03:15:10.307]  Well, I agree with you.
[03:15:10.307 --> 03:15:16.290]  I mean, even when I'm in rural areas, no one dare ride around with their gun rack.
[03:15:16.290 --> 03:15:21.332]  And if you're walking by your own property in the middle of nowhere, cops will pull over now and say, what are you doing with that shotgun?
[03:15:21.332 --> 03:15:23.754]  Well, I'm out here bird hunting.
[03:15:23.754 --> 03:15:24.774]  What are you doing?
[03:15:24.774 --> 03:15:25.915]  So you're right.
[03:15:25.915 --> 03:15:35.000]  We need to train the police and the establishment that they're not going to be allowed to just create this perception that our guns are illegal and dirty and bad.
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:35.480]  Absolutely.
[03:15:36.624 --> 03:15:40.745]  You weren't the only person out there who had firearms.
[03:15:40.745 --> 03:15:42.306]  I saw differing reports.
[03:15:42.306 --> 03:15:43.046]  I saw 4, 20.
[03:15:43.046 --> 03:15:47.027]  I mean, how many people were out there with their firearms?
[03:15:47.027 --> 03:15:50.568]  I've heard the number like 12 a lot, but I didn't do a count.
[03:15:50.568 --> 03:16:02.052]  I just, I would estimate that I saw personally maybe, um, maybe six, seven people total, but there could have been, I'm sure there was some people I didn't notice.
[03:16:02.827 --> 03:16:07.731]  Now, I mean, look, I could gut up to do this, but I have never done it.
[03:16:07.731 --> 03:16:19.580]  I mean, how do you not just go out to an event with your rifle or a handgun, you went to nearby where the god-like president was, they hype up all day, you know, like they're Zeus or something.
[03:16:19.580 --> 03:16:23.243]  What was it like, though, when you were putting it on your back, getting out of your car,
[03:16:23.863 --> 03:16:26.005]  I mean, what was it like as you were marching up?
[03:16:26.005 --> 03:16:31.209]  I mean, I would imagine the most dangerous point is when cops first see you walking up with a rifle.
[03:16:31.209 --> 03:16:32.771]  Do they come over and say, what are you doing?
[03:16:32.771 --> 03:16:39.557]  Or are they so aware in Arizona, because you've been letting them know you're not their slave, that they backed off?
[03:16:39.557 --> 03:16:48.745]  Yeah, I think in Arizona, Arizona police know it's legal and they've all, they appear to have been trained well, so they all kind of know the story on open carry here.
[03:16:49.642 --> 03:17:00.687]  But I thought maybe, what I was afraid of was the Secret Service may have just told them, well, in this case, while the President's here, you're gonna have to keep people out or whatever.
[03:17:00.687 --> 03:17:06.389]  So when I came out of the parking, we parked in a parking garage, like a below-ground parking garage when I first walked out.
[03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:08.190]  I was very nervous, but...
[03:17:09.423 --> 03:17:24.212]  I just thought, as long as I'm not touching it, as long as my hands are, you know, where they can see me, and I walk up calmly, and you know, I walked up to a police officer, I nodded my head at him, he nodded back to me, and I said, well, I guess they know the deal there.
[03:17:24.212 --> 03:17:27.274]  Well, you just are a trailblazer, my friend.
[03:17:27.274 --> 03:17:38.861]  You're literally for the Second Amendment rights that are some of the most basic, and I'm not just saying this because you're black, I mean, it fits the analogy, you're like the first person to go in
[03:17:40.307 --> 03:17:42.809]  And so is the fella up in New Hampshire.
[03:17:42.809 --> 03:17:49.475]  You're like the first people to go in and sit down at a lunch counter and say, you're going to serve me.
[03:17:49.475 --> 03:17:54.399]  And it's that type of courage that's going to get our Second Amendment back.
[03:17:54.399 --> 03:17:57.441]  Yeah, I hope so.
[03:17:57.441 --> 03:18:03.386]  The man in New Hampshire definitely helped me out, helped me to feel a lot better about it.
[03:18:03.386 --> 03:18:08.390]  Because I'm thinking about, what kind of trouble am I going to get into doing this?
[03:18:09.665 --> 03:18:16.288]  After seeing that he did it and there was really nothing very bad happened, that kind of put my mind at ease a little more.
[03:18:16.288 --> 03:18:17.688]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:18:30.721 --> 03:18:36.483]  But they will dig around and try to find something on you, or exaggerate something, or twist something.
[03:18:36.483 --> 03:18:38.963]  But you've just done a fabulous job.
[03:18:38.963 --> 03:18:42.264]  I mean, that's all I can say is, it's just beautiful.
[03:18:42.264 --> 03:18:44.165]  I mean, what ran through your mind then?
[03:18:44.165 --> 03:18:47.126]  I mean, how did you decide to do this?
[03:18:47.126 --> 03:18:55.608]  I wanted to do this at one of the tea party events, and I didn't have a sling for my AR yet.
[03:18:55.608 --> 03:18:59.489]  So I just carried concealed like I normally do, and I went to the tea parties.
[03:19:00.781 --> 03:19:06.328]  And when I heard that Obama was coming to town, I just thought, well, here's my chance.
[03:19:06.328 --> 03:19:09.973]  All I gotta do is go find a sling and I can go do this.
[03:19:09.973 --> 03:19:11.795]  That kind of event instead.
[03:19:11.795 --> 03:19:12.676]  And I just did it.
[03:19:14.206 --> 03:19:16.227]  Well, you know, that's another huge point you make.
[03:19:16.227 --> 03:19:18.967]  People are already walking around with concealed everywhere.
[03:19:18.967 --> 03:19:22.228]  What is it so scary about it in the open?
[03:19:22.228 --> 03:19:27.610]  Under our common law, it was a weapon concealed that people freaked out about.
[03:19:27.610 --> 03:19:39.493]  Back when we were truly free, people freaked out over a hidden weapon, not one out in the open because crooks, bad guys, highwaymen, freebooters, carried it,
[03:19:41.533 --> 03:19:42.554]  Hidden?
[03:19:42.554 --> 03:19:45.096]  Free men, good guys, carried him in the open.
[03:19:45.096 --> 03:19:45.676]  Stay with us.
[03:19:45.676 --> 03:19:48.618]  This is amazing information with Chris.
[03:19:48.618 --> 03:20:02.429]  He's quite a hero to the Second Amendment.
[03:20:02.429 --> 03:20:03.990]  Aerial spraying.
[03:20:03.990 --> 03:20:05.231]  Chemtrails.
[03:20:05.231 --> 03:20:06.692]  The modified atmosphere.
[03:20:07.372 --> 03:20:14.154]  Heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[03:20:14.154 --> 03:20:17.235]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[03:20:17.235 --> 03:20:26.938]  Detoxify with Micro Plant Powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[03:20:26.938 --> 03:20:31.639]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[03:20:31.639 --> 03:20:34.740]  Protect your family now with Micro Plant Powder.
[03:20:35.643 --> 03:20:36.383]  It is a big idea.
[03:20:36.383 --> 03:20:37.603]  A new world order.
[03:20:37.603 --> 03:20:41.344]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:21:05.296 --> 03:21:08.118]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:21:08.118 --> 03:21:10.919]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:21:10.919 --> 03:21:14.081]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:21:14.081 --> 03:21:21.405]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:21:24.434 --> 03:21:29.878]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:21:29.878 --> 03:21:33.760]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:21:33.760 --> 03:21:36.322]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:21:36.322 --> 03:21:37.303]  Most people have no idea.
[03:21:37.303 --> 03:21:38.263]  They're not after money.
[03:21:38.263 --> 03:21:39.544]  They have all the money they need.
[03:21:39.544 --> 03:21:40.545]  They're after power.
[03:21:40.545 --> 03:21:41.686]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:21:41.686 --> 03:21:46.449]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[03:21:50.391 --> 03:21:53.193]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[03:21:53.193 --> 03:21:54.294]  You have been warned.
[03:21:55.054 --> 03:21:55.234]  Yeah.
[03:21:55.234 --> 03:21:56.874]  Go.
[03:21:56.874 --> 03:21:57.975]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:57.975 --> 03:22:02.695]  It's Ron Paul's birthday and also Money Mom Day for Ron Paul's 2010 bid for U.S.
[03:22:02.695 --> 03:22:03.336]  Senate.
[03:22:03.336 --> 03:22:07.236]  I'm happy to report a very successful fundraiser at 1.30 p.m.
[03:22:07.236 --> 03:22:12.037]  Central Time and has already raised $489,078.
[03:22:12.037 --> 03:22:15.878]  For more information regarding this, come to GCNLive.com.
[03:22:15.878 --> 03:22:17.958]  Again, that's GCNLive.com.
[03:22:17.958 --> 03:22:21.299]  Once more, it's www.GCNLive.com.
[03:22:21.299 --> 03:22:23.259]  And happy birthday to the Ron Paul family.
[03:22:25.393 --> 03:22:28.335]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[03:22:28.335 --> 03:22:30.938]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[03:22:30.938 --> 03:22:34.781]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[03:22:34.781 --> 03:22:42.027]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[03:22:42.027 --> 03:22:44.609]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[03:22:44.609 --> 03:22:45.149]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:45.149 --> 03:22:46.550]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:55.106 --> 03:23:02.632]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:23:02.632 --> 03:23:07.136]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:23:07.136 --> 03:23:12.280]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[03:23:12.280 --> 03:23:19.745]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:23:19.745 --> 03:23:24.129]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[03:23:24.429 --> 03:23:30.452]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:23:30.452 --> 03:23:37.374]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[03:24:18.443 --> 03:24:31.202]  Chris is the gentleman who went out there with an AR-15 strapped to his back and, uh, you know, laid it out.
[03:24:31.202 --> 03:24:34.327]  In fact, there's a clip in the AP video
[03:24:36.016 --> 03:24:44.241]  It's actually in one of the YouTube videos where a lady comes over and says, I'm offended, that makes me uncomfortable, you're gone.
[03:24:44.241 --> 03:24:48.143]  Can you repeat here what you said to her and then elaborate on that?
[03:24:48.143 --> 03:24:51.905]  Because I think that really illustrates it beautifully.
[03:24:54.315 --> 03:25:03.660]  Boy, I couldn't recall everything from memory, but she just seemed to be like your average person that doesn't really understand firearm culture in America.
[03:25:03.660 --> 03:25:05.461]  She was just afraid.
[03:25:05.461 --> 03:25:06.922]  She was nice.
[03:25:06.922 --> 03:25:09.003]  We had a civil discussion.
[03:25:09.003 --> 03:25:09.704]  Oh, come on.
[03:25:09.704 --> 03:25:11.024]  She was a dingbat.
[03:25:11.024 --> 03:25:12.005]  No, she wasn't.
[03:25:12.005 --> 03:25:14.226]  She wasn't mean.
[03:25:14.226 --> 03:25:20.089]  I wish people knew a little more than what she knows, but you can't blame her too much.
[03:25:20.089 --> 03:25:21.430]  She was perfectly polite and everything.
[03:25:24.162 --> 03:25:26.364]  Well, I mean, she came over and said, that makes me uncomfortable.
[03:25:26.364 --> 03:25:30.506]  And you said, well, there was a time when the color of my skin would make you uncomfortable.
[03:25:30.506 --> 03:25:33.428]  And I think that really shut her up.
[03:25:33.428 --> 03:25:35.209]  Yeah, yeah, a little bit.
[03:25:35.209 --> 03:25:39.992]  I think people need to come to terms with some fears in life.
[03:25:39.992 --> 03:25:45.295]  You know, if you have freedom in this country, there's going to be danger that goes along with it.
[03:25:45.295 --> 03:25:46.836]  And you've got to just learn how to deal with that.
[03:25:46.836 --> 03:25:50.439]  You can't just become hysterical about it and freak out.
[03:25:53.140 --> 03:25:54.912]  Yeah, that was the other great point you made.
[03:25:55.908 --> 03:25:58.629]  That we have hundreds of thousands of people die every year in car wrecks.
[03:25:58.629 --> 03:25:59.809]  We still drive cars.
[03:25:59.809 --> 03:26:03.930]  I mean, this is part of life.
[03:26:03.930 --> 03:26:09.071]  If you're just ninnying afraid of things all day, you're not going to have any life worth living.
[03:26:09.071 --> 03:26:17.573]  There is no safe life to live, and the government uses the name of safety to take all our freedoms, and we end up not even being safe.
[03:26:17.573 --> 03:26:22.594]  The cities that have the gun control... In fact, that one lady's like, well, you can't have a gun in D.C.
[03:26:22.594 --> 03:26:25.315]  And you're like, yeah, and they got the highest crime rate, lady.
[03:26:26.138 --> 03:26:28.258]  Yeah.
[03:26:28.258 --> 03:26:29.339]  Yeah.
[03:26:29.339 --> 03:26:32.219]  But listen, tell... Go ahead.
[03:26:32.219 --> 03:26:46.382]  Oh, I had another discussion with a man who said, you know, well, how would you... How would you... Because, you know, I don't consider my... I told him... We got into a debate about libertarianism, and I told him I'm not a libertarian, and, you know, if I had to put a label on myself, I guess I'd be an anarchist.
[03:26:46.382 --> 03:26:51.363]  And he said, well, how would you protect yourself from, like, a terrorist attack, like a Timothy McVeigh type attack?
[03:26:51.363 --> 03:26:54.624]  And I said, well, how did the government protect people from a Timothy McVeigh type attack?
[03:26:57.625 --> 03:26:59.106]  Yeah, they can't do it.
[03:26:59.106 --> 03:27:13.131]  In fact, they actually did it, so... Yeah, they still did it, so we empower these government agents to protect us, and we trust that they're going to use that power to protect us, and then they fail all the time anyway, so it's just silly.
[03:27:13.131 --> 03:27:22.955]  Well, that's what's so asinine, is there's a lot of great cops, they put their lives on the line, it's a tough job in many cases, but the average 911 call takes like 11 and a half minutes.
[03:27:22.955 --> 03:27:24.815]  In fact, guys, search engine that.
[03:27:24.815 --> 03:27:25.436]  Average 911 call.
[03:27:26.775 --> 03:27:31.341]  But I think it's, it changes every year, but last time I saw it, it was right under 12 minutes.
[03:27:31.341 --> 03:27:36.207]  Folks, if somebody's breaking into your house wanting to come kill you, you don't have 12 minutes, you don't have 30 seconds.
[03:27:37.242 --> 03:27:41.285]  And then the police argue, we don't have to protect you.
[03:27:41.285 --> 03:27:42.746]  It's not our job to protect you.
[03:27:42.746 --> 03:27:45.849]  And that's actually true under the common law.
[03:27:45.849 --> 03:27:52.314]  They are to respond after a crime has been committed to bring the people to justice before a jury of their peers.
[03:27:52.314 --> 03:28:04.824]  The police are hired by us to bring the criminal to us because we will sit in judgment as the sovereigns.
[03:28:04.824 --> 03:28:05.985]  Your comments on that, Chris?
[03:28:07.528 --> 03:28:15.292]  Uh... I'm sorry, uh... I... I didn't... I kind of... Something distracted me here.
[03:28:15.292 --> 03:28:16.433]  I didn't hear that last part.
[03:28:16.433 --> 03:28:17.974]  I understand you've got somebody talking to you.
[03:28:17.974 --> 03:28:20.495]  Look, specifically, you were pretty wound up when you were out there.
[03:28:20.495 --> 03:28:22.876]  I mean, not a lot, but compared to now you were wound up.
[03:28:22.876 --> 03:28:24.397]  Relax, my friend.
[03:28:24.397 --> 03:28:26.178]  Tell us your bottom line.
[03:28:26.178 --> 03:28:28.819]  Was it empowering?
[03:28:28.819 --> 03:28:34.863]  Uh, because... Oh yeah, it was empowering and it was inspirational, too, just to realize, you know, that I could still do this in America.
[03:28:36.092 --> 03:28:45.854]  Here's a country where you can go, you know, you can go right up to the tyrant's front door, wherever he is, and, you know, stand there with your weapon and not get stomped out.
[03:28:45.854 --> 03:28:48.855]  You know, it was kind of inspirational.
[03:28:48.855 --> 03:28:52.256]  Well, what did Frederick Douglass say?
[03:28:52.256 --> 03:28:56.097]  To paraphrase, he said, rights are not given, they're taken.
[03:28:57.726 --> 03:28:58.287]  Exactly.
[03:29:17.419 --> 03:29:20.222]  Lying down to corruption keeps them safe.
[03:29:20.222 --> 03:29:23.424]  That actually brings the pain, brings the tyranny.
[03:29:23.424 --> 03:29:28.528]  I want to come back and take calls for you at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:29:28.528 --> 03:29:31.491]  Specifically for our guests, 800-259-9231.
[03:29:31.491 --> 03:29:42.620]  And we're also going to get into some more stories of things we don't see on video of people that confronted him or things that happened.
[03:29:42.620 --> 03:29:44.862]  We'll be right back with our guest, Open Carrot.
[03:29:46.124 --> 03:29:47.525]  We're on the march.
[03:29:47.525 --> 03:29:49.107]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:49.107 --> 03:29:52.730]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:55.694 --> 03:30:00.900]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:30:00.900 --> 03:30:04.925]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:30:04.925 --> 03:30:10.831]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:30:10.831 --> 03:30:15.897]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:30:15.897 --> 03:30:16.398]  Number three,
[03:30:16.798 --> 03:30:23.104]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:30:23.104 --> 03:30:26.007]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:30:26.007 --> 03:30:30.531]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:30:30.531 --> 03:30:34.135]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:30:34.355 --> 03:30:40.096]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:30:40.096 --> 03:30:44.798]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:44.798 --> 03:30:46.558]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:46.558 --> 03:30:49.139]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[03:30:49.139 --> 03:30:51.759]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[03:30:55.404 --> 03:30:56.785]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:30:56.785 --> 03:30:58.767]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:30:58.767 --> 03:30:59.428]  Well, you should.
[03:30:59.428 --> 03:31:04.253]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:31:04.253 --> 03:31:05.054]  That's right.
[03:31:05.054 --> 03:31:13.722]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[03:31:13.722 --> 03:31:15.084]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[03:31:15.084 --> 03:31:16.225]  Plus, if you act fast.
[03:31:16.425 --> 03:31:22.409]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:31:22.409 --> 03:31:29.293]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[03:31:29.293 --> 03:31:34.817]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[03:31:34.817 --> 03:31:36.278]  This is real.
[03:31:36.278 --> 03:31:37.338]  Don't miss out.
[03:31:37.338 --> 03:31:44.203]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[03:31:44.603 --> 03:31:59.374]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:31:59.374 --> 03:32:04.698]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:32:04.698 --> 03:32:06.739]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:32:06.739 --> 03:32:11.523]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:32:11.783 --> 03:32:12.904]  How much do you want?
[03:32:12.904 --> 03:32:14.045]  When do you want it?
[03:32:14.045 --> 03:32:15.926]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:32:15.926 --> 03:32:17.007]  When will you need it?
[03:32:17.007 --> 03:32:19.188]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:32:19.188 --> 03:32:20.529]  Will there be any food?
[03:32:20.529 --> 03:32:22.070]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:27.334]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:32:27.334 --> 03:32:30.916]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:32:30.916 --> 03:32:34.399]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:32:34.739 --> 03:32:35.960]  How much will you need?
[03:32:35.960 --> 03:32:36.861]  We don't know.
[03:32:36.861 --> 03:32:37.962]  How much do you want?
[03:32:37.962 --> 03:32:38.902]  All you can get.
[03:32:38.902 --> 03:32:40.003]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:32:40.003 --> 03:32:43.046]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:32:43.046 --> 03:32:44.827]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:32:44.827 --> 03:32:45.728]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:33:00.845 --> 03:33:03.187]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:33:03.187 --> 03:33:04.288]  to 3 p.m.
[03:33:04.288 --> 03:33:05.348]  Central Standard Time.
[03:33:05.348 --> 03:33:09.031]  We're here and back with an abbreviated transmission 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:33:09.031 --> 03:33:10.012]  on Sundays.
[03:33:10.012 --> 03:33:14.475]  Don't forget the podcast that suckers up to 167,000 people downloading it each and every day and growing.
[03:33:18.058 --> 03:33:21.942]  Free podcast at Infowars.com right there on the listen page.
[03:33:21.942 --> 03:33:26.907]  Listen how you want, when you want, where you want, and you can save them as well.
[03:33:26.907 --> 03:33:31.872]  Also complete archives at PrisonPlanet.tv and we restream 24 hours a day.
[03:33:33.789 --> 03:33:40.194]  We have Chris who made international news, the British were freaking out, the Europeans.
[03:33:40.194 --> 03:33:42.095]  Think of how crazy this is.
[03:33:42.095 --> 03:33:50.902]  The humans have been so trained that cops, black uniforms, cameras, SWAT teams, checkpoints, all the things that historically should freak us out.
[03:33:50.902 --> 03:33:53.804]  You shouldn't be scared of a citizen with a weapon.
[03:33:53.804 --> 03:33:58.248]  Like in Switzerland, you see men riding along with their guns on their backs, little kids with guns.
[03:33:58.248 --> 03:34:00.469]  Never get invaded, everybody's scared of them.
[03:34:00.469 --> 03:34:02.211]  Peaceful, lowest crime rate in the world.
[03:34:03.658 --> 03:34:06.163]  Our model really came off the Swiss, if you really want to know.
[03:34:09.025 --> 03:34:12.806]  They are just so afraid because we've been gilded.
[03:34:12.806 --> 03:34:20.467]  It's like a nation of... And they're like, it's so scary, people are posting Obama posters!
[03:34:20.467 --> 03:34:22.948]  Look at the Hays County Free Press.
[03:34:22.948 --> 03:34:24.608]  It's a good newspaper.
[03:34:24.608 --> 03:34:27.088]  Pretty good newspaper.
[03:34:27.088 --> 03:34:36.230]  In Hays County, this is a place, it's a CPS happy hunting ground down there, kidnapping kids, but the newspaper says freedom
[03:34:38.163 --> 03:34:41.426]  Of hate speech!
[03:34:41.426 --> 03:35:02.802]  I'm being a little sarcastic about it being a pretty good newspaper, but the point is, this is right south of Austin, and it says, area resident Chuck Luttrick is a Republican, but he says he's outraged and sickened by the flyer stuck to telephone poles around Kyle, putting President Obama's face distorted into a gruesome Joker mask.
[03:35:03.735 --> 03:35:06.918]  With the words socialism and fascism underneath.
[03:35:06.918 --> 03:35:09.419]  This is appalling, Luttrick said.
[03:35:09.419 --> 03:35:10.520]  I serve in the military.
[03:35:10.520 --> 03:35:13.363]  That's my commander-in-chief.
[03:35:13.363 --> 03:35:15.504]  That's your commander-in-chief?
[03:35:15.504 --> 03:35:20.408]  Well, it's our right and duty to criticize your commander.
[03:35:20.408 --> 03:35:27.874]  And your commander... By the way, they go and pick and choose the few people, the very few that
[03:35:29.588 --> 03:35:30.429]  are actually against this.
[03:35:30.429 --> 03:35:33.611]  You go look at the comments on all these newspapers and TV stations.
[03:35:33.611 --> 03:35:35.573]  Again, it's one out of ten is against us.
[03:35:37.597 --> 03:35:50.549]  In order to awaken the people in Obama's agenda, Alex is organizing a contest centered around the Obama as the Joker poster that has Democrats and Obamanoids going ballistic, Jones states on his website InfoWars.com.
[03:35:50.549 --> 03:35:59.418]  Locals began reporting flyers late last week primarily plastered around Kyle, but they're part of a nationwide campaign spearheaded by conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones.
[03:36:00.523 --> 03:36:03.444]  And then it just goes into saying I'm basically a hate criminal.
[03:36:03.444 --> 03:36:08.365]  There's the headline, freedom of speech, freedom of hate speech.
[03:36:08.365 --> 03:36:10.865]  So it's illegal.
[03:36:10.865 --> 03:36:19.247]  Going back to Chris, Chris, isn't it really the media saying it's racist or hate to criticize the president?
[03:36:19.247 --> 03:36:21.367]  Aren't they making it a racial issue?
[03:36:21.367 --> 03:36:24.008]  Aren't they injecting race to divide and conquer?
[03:36:25.009 --> 03:36:26.810]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:36:26.810 --> 03:36:28.171]  I don't even believe in it.
[03:36:28.171 --> 03:36:50.846]  When people throw out the label of racist nowadays, I want to see what that person is saying, because chances are they're saying something that people don't want me to hear, and they have no way to refute what they're saying, so they just slap this label of racist on them, because, you know, the sheep out there will just have an emotional response to that, and they'll shut them out, you know?
[03:36:50.846 --> 03:36:53.748]  So when I hear racist, I actually want to hear what the person has to say.
[03:36:55.760 --> 03:36:58.141]  Absolutely.
[03:36:58.141 --> 03:37:00.262]  Well, it's certainly a political power.
[03:37:00.262 --> 03:37:13.566]  I mean, black leaders, white leaders, Hispanic leaders, Asian leaders do it, because if you come out and make stuff tribal, we're designed to act that way at a fundamental level, people can get a lot of power out of that.
[03:37:13.566 --> 03:37:15.587]  But at the same time, how do we not
[03:37:16.960 --> 03:37:18.141]  Like, take the open borders.
[03:37:18.141 --> 03:37:21.724]  And I know you're saying you're past libertarian at anarchy level.
[03:37:21.724 --> 03:37:29.951]  But, as long as we have borders and governments, they are clearly using the migrant population to drive down wages and balkanize.
[03:37:29.951 --> 03:37:35.416]  But then if I just come out and engage in this, it almost feeds into it.
[03:37:35.416 --> 03:37:36.337]  So what do you do?
[03:37:36.337 --> 03:37:38.038]  Just let the New World Order do whatever they want?
[03:37:38.038 --> 03:37:40.120]  Hmm.
[03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:43.003]  Boy, I kind of got lost there on that.
[03:37:45.111 --> 03:37:46.435]  I'm sorry, I kind of...
[03:37:53.496 --> 03:37:58.057]  I mean, I'm dumbfounded too, because I don't want to go around fighting with people.
[03:37:58.057 --> 03:38:15.282]  I don't want to go around, but I played a video earlier, I don't know if you've seen it, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, of people at town hall meetings saying they don't want Obamacare, being screamed at that they're racist, and the Hispanics are running around with Mexican flags,
[03:38:16.346 --> 03:38:20.547]  Screaming and yelling, saying, this is our country, we're going to kick you white people out.
[03:38:20.547 --> 03:38:22.467]  And then screaming N-word at black people.
[03:38:22.467 --> 03:38:25.148]  I mean, it just seems like insanity.
[03:38:25.148 --> 03:38:29.728]  I think this whole immigration thing is like, it's a straw man, you know?
[03:38:29.728 --> 03:38:37.570]  If we could get the government out of our economy and out of our lives, we would all live such prosperous, you know, easy life lives.
[03:38:37.570 --> 03:38:39.910]  We wouldn't care about immigration policy.
[03:38:39.910 --> 03:38:43.711]  We wouldn't care about who was coming and who was going and all this other stuff.
[03:38:44.375 --> 03:38:51.500]  So I think that's what we should be focusing on instead of whether or not certain people can come here or not, you know.
[03:38:51.500 --> 03:39:03.809]  It's just that the issue is that we do have this big government system where we have to have the insurance, the ID cards, everything, and then the illegals are just above it all doing whatever they want.
[03:39:03.809 --> 03:39:05.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:39:05.530 --> 03:39:11.134]  So let's get rid of all these welfare programs and let's get rid of that stuff that is a non-issue.
[03:39:13.288 --> 03:39:14.469]  Well, I agree with you.
[03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:16.249]  No, no, I agree with you.
[03:39:16.249 --> 03:39:18.050]  And that's exactly what they were there mad about.
[03:39:18.050 --> 03:39:19.371]  They want the free health care.
[03:39:19.371 --> 03:39:20.691]  It's not free.
[03:39:20.691 --> 03:39:22.392]  Don't they understand that?
[03:39:22.392 --> 03:39:23.013]  No, they don't.
[03:39:23.013 --> 03:39:23.733]  They actually don't.
[03:39:23.733 --> 03:39:28.395]  Because every time you ask them who's going to pay for it, they go, well, why are you always concerned about money?
[03:39:28.395 --> 03:39:32.077]  And it's just totally removed from their mind.
[03:39:32.077 --> 03:39:36.499]  I'm starting to believe they really do think that the government just produces wealth out of nowhere.
[03:39:36.499 --> 03:39:38.820]  Because that's how they act.
[03:39:38.820 --> 03:39:39.720]  As somebody
[03:39:41.249 --> 03:39:43.130]  Who's a black man?
[03:39:43.130 --> 03:39:53.195]  When you see the media saying, and of course they know it isn't true, they just brutally are using it cold-bloodedly like Alan Key said last week as a political weapon.
[03:39:53.195 --> 03:39:56.516]  But when you just hear them say racist, racist, racist, racist.
[03:39:56.516 --> 03:39:59.478]  I mean have you had people call you racist because you don't like Obama?
[03:39:59.991 --> 03:40:10.958]  A lot of times people call me a racist all my life because I don't fit into their little box of what they think, you know, an African-American or black or whatever, you know, whatever the PC term is nowadays.
[03:40:10.958 --> 03:40:15.340]  If I don't fit into their little box, they call me a racist and I look at it like a badge of honor.
[03:40:15.340 --> 03:40:19.062]  I must be saying something right if they're labeling me as a racist.
[03:40:19.062 --> 03:40:21.424]  What do they call you, a self-loathing black person?
[03:40:22.125 --> 03:40:32.329]  They'll call me racist, Uncle Tom, they'll go, oh you're the kind of, you must be one of those kind of black people that would join the KKK, or you know, this ridiculous, ridiculous lunacy.
[03:40:32.329 --> 03:40:42.494]  And I think it's hilarious because they have to resort, they have to resort to insults like that because they cannot, they cannot argue, they have no argument to bring to the table.
[03:40:42.494 --> 03:40:46.976]  Yeah, they must think the Chappelle piece is real when he plays the part of the black man.
[03:40:46.976 --> 03:40:48.897]  Yeah, I guess, I guess so.
[03:40:48.897 --> 03:40:49.497]  You ever seen that?
[03:40:49.497 --> 03:40:50.437]  It's pretty funny.
[03:40:50.437 --> 03:40:51.538]  Oh yeah, it's kind of funny, yeah.
[03:40:54.403 --> 03:40:55.424]  Well, I've also found that
[03:41:17.403 --> 03:41:20.568]  The so-called left are a bunch of control freak eugenicists.
[03:41:20.568 --> 03:41:24.153]  You know, if you're talking about an actual, even mid-level policy person.
[03:41:24.153 --> 03:41:25.915]  They're all the same.
[03:41:25.915 --> 03:41:27.938]  And Margaret Sanger and all of it.
[03:41:27.938 --> 03:41:31.864]  I actually find they're the real racists who are smart enough.
[03:41:31.864 --> 03:41:32.305]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:41:32.853 --> 03:41:34.794]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[03:41:34.794 --> 03:41:43.160]  I think like, for example, the Democratic Party, in my opinion, the Democratic Party looks at black people in this country as, like, purchased votes.
[03:41:43.160 --> 03:41:44.341]  You know, these are my voters.
[03:41:44.341 --> 03:41:45.121]  These are my votes.
[03:41:45.121 --> 03:41:45.942]  I own them.
[03:41:45.942 --> 03:41:49.044]  I've propagandized them for so long that they're mine.
[03:41:49.044 --> 03:41:56.048]  And if you try and open up their mind a little bit, they're going to label you as a racist so that people won't hear what you have to say.
[03:41:56.048 --> 03:41:57.309]  So I think they're the real racists.
[03:41:58.717 --> 03:41:59.738]  Well, I agree.
[03:41:59.738 --> 03:42:14.129]  I mean, when Keith Uberman and Chris Matthews and Carlos Watson and all these guys get up on TV every day, I mean, every time I turn it on, they're saying, and I probably watch it twice a week, it must just be wall-to-wall.
[03:42:14.129 --> 03:42:20.374]  So I've seen CNN that it's racist, and here's the local paper, freedom of hate speech.
[03:42:22.171 --> 03:42:27.973]  And it's saying, and I've got national Spanish TV saying, arrest me, that it's racist.
[03:42:27.973 --> 03:42:40.897]  I mean, in America, I am being told that I need to be arrested, and then they've got the State Attorney General preparing for felony charges against somebody for sticking them on telephone poles.
[03:42:40.897 --> 03:42:47.959]  But then Obama can be in the Washington Post saying, stick my posters and my campaign signs on stop signs.
[03:42:50.563 --> 03:42:51.927]  I mean, is that not hypocrisy?
[03:42:51.927 --> 03:42:53.712]  Sounds like it to me.
[03:42:55.370 --> 03:43:00.133]  Well, there's a lot of questions I could throw out at you, but I got a bunch of calls specifically for you.
[03:43:00.133 --> 03:43:04.496]  We've got on the line the gentleman who was out there with his AR-15.
[03:43:04.496 --> 03:43:09.359]  This woman walks over, the poster woman for dingbats of the planet.
[03:43:09.359 --> 03:43:12.101]  I don't mean to be mean, but I'm just so sick of idiots.
[03:43:12.101 --> 03:43:18.965]  And she comes over, and she comes over and goes, you've got a fully automatic AK-47!
[03:43:18.965 --> 03:43:22.788]  And they always act like fully automatic is like a hydrogen bomb.
[03:43:23.757 --> 03:43:30.319]  I mean, I wouldn't want a full auto assault rifle.
[03:43:30.319 --> 03:43:35.561]  30 rounds on single shot, if you're trying to actually aim, you know, you want the 30 rounds.
[03:43:35.561 --> 03:43:40.003]  You don't want, you want to be pull the trigger and shoot.
[03:43:40.003 --> 03:43:45.085]  Now, if you had a heavy gun in a machine gun placement, where you were going to have human wave attacks,
[03:43:46.045 --> 03:44:05.649]  Then a belt-fed machine gun would be good, but this worship of full-auto and the power of it, and how the media always shows handguns and calls them automatic weapons, and it's this magicalness of... I mean, it's all psychological warfare, and she walks over and she goes, your AK-47's full-auto!
[03:44:05.649 --> 03:44:09.309]  You go, well, it's an AR-15 and it's semi-automatic.
[03:44:09.309 --> 03:44:11.930]  And she's just such a... I mean, she's just such a moron.
[03:44:14.437 --> 03:44:17.979]  No, I mean, these women will send their kids off to school.
[03:44:17.979 --> 03:44:22.642]  Their young men tell them, don't over-fight back if somebody attacks you.
[03:44:22.642 --> 03:44:27.105]  They send their daughters to be raped and killed in college.
[03:44:27.105 --> 03:44:29.746]  I mean, these women all the time don't have guns.
[03:44:29.746 --> 03:44:34.109]  You better believe, my daughters, when they move out of the house, they're going to know how to use guns.
[03:44:34.109 --> 03:44:38.531]  And if somebody starts busting in their door, they are going to kill you.
[03:44:38.531 --> 03:44:42.133]  But no, the feminists are like, no, you've got to make sure women are victims.
[03:44:42.133 --> 03:44:42.754]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:44:44.022 --> 03:44:44.562]  No, I didn't.
[03:44:44.562 --> 03:44:49.306]  No, no, and I want you to comment on what I was just saying.
[03:44:49.306 --> 03:44:51.288]  Oh, I mean, yeah, I agree.
[03:44:51.288 --> 03:44:52.309]  You know what else is funny?
[03:44:52.309 --> 03:45:02.977]  It's like, every woman I've ever met that arms herself and, you know, takes pride in her ability to defend herself was always a really, you know, just a really cool chick.
[03:45:02.977 --> 03:45:11.524]  I mean, I don't know what it is about, you know, you put a gun in a woman's hand and teach her how to shoot it and a lot of changes take place.
[03:45:12.386 --> 03:45:15.888]  They become empowered, and that's the kind of woman we want.
[03:45:15.888 --> 03:45:21.291]  Strong, smart women that are teamed up with their men, that understand the systems against the family.
[03:45:21.291 --> 03:45:34.699]  Instead, the women are like, I'm with the government, and I'm gonna show you, and literally they become the house slave, and they actually have government manuals on this, the woman's in the house, and this wasn't just with blacks, the Romans did this.
[03:45:34.699 --> 03:45:41.363]  When they would enslave a German or French tribe, the Gauls, or the Vandals, or the others, the Austrians, the Austriagoths,
[03:45:41.863 --> 03:45:41.983]  Whoa.
[03:45:41.983 --> 03:45:43.245]  I've never heard of that.
[03:45:53.558 --> 03:45:59.843]  Well that's what feminism is and Gloria Steinem admits she's CIA in her own book and was there to break the family up.
[03:45:59.843 --> 03:46:01.604]  And we're on to their scam.
[03:46:01.604 --> 03:46:04.306]  And there's nothing better than an empowered woman.
[03:46:04.306 --> 03:46:05.567]  Super sexy.
[03:46:05.567 --> 03:46:18.417]  Let's go ahead and I mean I hate these cowardly chicken neck domesticated little women that think their power is hating their man and putting their kids on Prozac and Ritalin and lording around the house with their weak husbands groveling.
[03:46:19.658 --> 03:46:21.419]  Those women are totally unhappy.
[03:46:21.419 --> 03:46:24.679]  But see, they pimp you and then the state pimps them.
[03:46:24.679 --> 03:46:28.000]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Jake in Texas.
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:32.341]  You're on with one hell of an American, one hell of a person who loves liberty.
[03:46:32.341 --> 03:46:38.122]  You're on the air with a man who had the AR-15 strapped to his back as the liberty and freedom just spreads across the country.
[03:46:38.122 --> 03:46:39.323]  Go ahead.
[03:46:39.323 --> 03:46:40.083]  Yes sir, yes sir.
[03:46:40.083 --> 03:46:43.924]  What a good looking gentleman you look like, my friend.
[03:46:43.924 --> 03:46:47.725]  I gotta say, I gotta say, your performance was exemplary.
[03:46:47.725 --> 03:46:48.325]  I have to say.
[03:46:49.315 --> 03:46:50.495]  Keep your hands off him now.
[03:46:50.495 --> 03:46:54.536]  Now anyways, go ahead and call her.
[03:46:54.536 --> 03:46:55.896]  I have to say something to myself.
[03:46:55.896 --> 03:46:56.677]  You know, you know what?
[03:46:56.677 --> 03:46:57.857]  One more thing you should have said.
[03:46:57.857 --> 03:47:02.518]  You should have said, you know, when she came up to you, you know, trying to neuter you, you know, she just couldn't.
[03:47:02.518 --> 03:47:03.478]  And I'm like, what?
[03:47:03.478 --> 03:47:05.658]  I mean, men with guns?
[03:47:05.658 --> 03:47:08.619]  And you should have just looked at her and given her a wink, you know.
[03:47:08.619 --> 03:47:10.459]  That's how we do it.
[03:47:10.459 --> 03:47:10.960]  Exactly.
[03:47:10.960 --> 03:47:13.180]  That's how it is, baby.
[03:47:13.180 --> 03:47:15.220]  That's how we roll.
[03:47:15.220 --> 03:47:16.001]  Exactly.
[03:47:16.001 --> 03:47:16.501]  Exactly.
[03:47:16.501 --> 03:47:16.841]  Thank you.
[03:47:16.841 --> 03:47:17.361]  Thank you, Mrs. Jones.
[03:47:20.360 --> 03:47:31.093]  You should have said, man, you know, we're actually here to defend the president against assassination from these crazed healthcare maniacs who are just finding out what's going on.
[03:47:31.093 --> 03:47:36.319]  To be honest with you, I definitely wasn't there to do that, but... That's what I would have said.
[03:47:38.476 --> 03:47:39.377]  Put that one more in there.
[03:47:39.377 --> 03:47:53.328]  You know, we're not here just to, you know, you know, totally, you know, you know, exhibit, you know, our rights of open carry, you know, this and that, exercise, you know, but we're here to defend Obama against, you know, we... Well, listen, listen, I will say this.
[03:47:54.409 --> 03:47:56.811]  I would defend Obama because he's a puppet.
[03:47:56.811 --> 03:48:01.333]  He's an actor for foreign banks just like Bush and everybody else before him, back to Kennedy.
[03:48:01.333 --> 03:48:05.256]  And so if anything ever happens to him, they're going to use it against the Second Amendment.
[03:48:05.256 --> 03:48:06.256]  But that's a great point.
[03:48:06.256 --> 03:48:10.219]  That's why we are all armed, is to keep the peace.
[03:48:10.219 --> 03:48:18.864]  And you have a lot of folks attacking the Tea Party people, and it would have been Chris's right to defend himself if somebody came after him with a meat cleaver or something.
[03:48:20.128 --> 03:48:20.769]  Exactly.
[03:48:20.769 --> 03:48:21.769]  Of course.
[03:48:21.769 --> 03:48:30.216]  And there's no way that we're going to progress forward freely unless we stick to our code that we have written for us.
[03:48:30.216 --> 03:48:31.637]  Those are so important.
[03:48:31.637 --> 03:48:33.138]  We have to do that.
[03:48:33.138 --> 03:48:35.040]  Jake, I'm going to let you go.
[03:48:35.040 --> 03:48:38.282]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Nebraska.
[03:48:38.282 --> 03:48:39.143]  Richard, you're on the air.
[03:48:39.143 --> 03:48:40.864]  Go ahead.
[03:48:40.864 --> 03:48:41.685]  Hello?
[03:48:41.685 --> 03:48:43.366]  Yes, sir.
[03:48:43.366 --> 03:48:46.409]  Last night on the Daily Show at 7pm viewing,
[03:48:48.055 --> 03:48:57.861]  They made a comment besides Keith Overman as well, but I thought it was rather insulting when they commented about the health care bill.
[03:48:57.861 --> 03:49:09.509]  And then they said, oh, and then the way he phrased it was, these people also showed up with rifles and everything around there.
[03:49:09.509 --> 03:49:17.334]  And then he gives you a strange look in the camera and says, now what the so-and-so are these people doing?
[03:49:17.972 --> 03:49:19.754]  Yeah, we've got the report.
[03:49:19.754 --> 03:49:21.936]  Let's play some of it now.
[03:49:21.936 --> 03:49:22.597]  Here it is.
[03:49:35.350 --> 03:49:44.356]  The Southern Poverty Law Center shows that right-wing militias, ideologically driven tax defiers, and so-called sovereign citizens are materializing in significant numbers.
[03:49:44.356 --> 03:49:47.399]  One federal agent noting, you see people buying into what they're saying.
[03:49:47.399 --> 03:49:49.320]  It's primed to grow.
[03:49:49.320 --> 03:49:50.801]  What's priming the movement's growth?
[03:49:50.801 --> 03:49:55.905]  An ailing economy, of course, but one key difference between militia groups in the 90s and what's fueling actions now?
[03:49:55.905 --> 03:49:57.886]  The face of the federal government.
[03:49:57.886 --> 03:50:02.910]  The enemy that almost all parts of the extreme right see as the primary threat to freedom is now black.
[03:50:03.789 --> 03:50:05.710]  Another key factor, a changing demographic.
[03:50:05.710 --> 03:50:11.773]  Contributing to the racial animus have been fears on the far right about the consequences of Latino immigration.
[03:50:11.773 --> 03:50:13.274]  But hate groups are not the only problem.
[03:50:13.274 --> 03:50:18.997]  Federal authorities are also focusing on those who may be contemplating politically charged assaults and acting alone.
[03:50:18.997 --> 03:50:29.902]  The FBI's Lone Wolf Initiative launched to prevent single acts of hate-fueled violence, like the fatal shooting of three Pittsburgh police officers, or the killing of a black security guard at the Holocaust Museum in D.C.
[03:50:29.902 --> 03:50:30.543]  Stop right there!
[03:50:31.383 --> 03:50:33.063]  This is the guilt by association.
[03:50:33.063 --> 03:50:40.325]  They used this Von Brun, who had been in federal custody, probably a staged deal, to then connect to the Second Amendment.
[03:50:40.325 --> 03:50:41.245]  They just ran in here.
[03:50:41.245 --> 03:50:44.166]  CNN is attacking Chris right now.
[03:50:44.166 --> 03:50:45.566]  We've got him here on air.
[03:50:45.566 --> 03:50:49.407]  We're going to go into overdrive the day with him because this is so important.
[03:50:49.407 --> 03:50:50.968]  We're going to continue with your phone calls.
[03:50:50.968 --> 03:50:54.008]  Richard, Jerry, Jenny, and others.
[03:50:54.008 --> 03:50:55.809]  Infowars.com is the website.
[03:50:57.401 --> 03:50:58.703]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:50:58.703 --> 03:51:04.311]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:51:04.311 --> 03:51:09.318]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:51:09.318 --> 03:51:09.798]  It's true.
[03:51:09.798 --> 03:51:14.365]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:51:14.885 --> 03:51:20.111]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:51:20.111 --> 03:51:27.239]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:51:27.239 --> 03:51:28.360]  And here's the best part.
[03:51:28.360 --> 03:51:34.707]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:51:35.027 --> 03:51:38.210]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:51:38.210 --> 03:51:40.431]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:51:40.431 --> 03:51:41.372]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:51:41.372 --> 03:51:41.572]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:51:41.572 --> 03:51:45.015]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:51:45.015 --> 03:51:46.756]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:51:58.104 --> 03:52:04.127]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:04.127 --> 03:52:10.011]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:10.011 --> 03:52:16.174]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:16.514 --> 03:52:18.475]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:18.475 --> 03:52:20.937]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:20.937 --> 03:52:34.124]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:34.124 --> 03:52:35.805]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:35.805 --> 03:52:37.666]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:37.666 --> 03:52:43.890]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:44.568 --> 03:52:52.837]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:52.837 --> 03:52:54.399]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:54.399 --> 03:52:55.601]  The people strike back!
[03:52:57.418 --> 03:53:04.640]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[03:53:04.640 --> 03:53:08.582]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[03:53:08.582 --> 03:53:16.905]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[03:53:16.905 --> 03:53:19.806]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[03:53:19.806 --> 03:53:22.587]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[03:53:22.587 --> 03:53:26.788]  Thieves get near you, push a button, and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[03:53:27.028 --> 03:53:28.688]  Put a stop to identity theft.
[03:53:28.688 --> 03:53:30.769]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[03:53:30.769 --> 03:53:33.510]  Here you will find radio-blocking secure sleeves.
[03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:41.092]  Simply place your credit cards and passports into these slim, lightweight sleeves and you will put a stop to anyone trying to collect your private information.
[03:53:41.092 --> 03:53:45.033]  For around $5, you will be protected against RFID theft.
[03:53:45.033 --> 03:53:47.494]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[03:53:47.494 --> 03:53:49.974]  That's IDStronghold.com.
[03:53:49.974 --> 03:53:50.475]  Or call 1-800-610-2770.
[03:53:50.475 --> 03:53:50.535]  1-800-610-2770.
[03:54:09.481 --> 03:54:13.464]  A few times Chris has sounded distracted.
[03:54:13.464 --> 03:54:23.870]  He's getting so many text messages from his friends hearing him on the show that it's like my phone when a text comes in it goes doot and then pops up and kind of distracts you so that's that's going on.
[03:54:23.870 --> 03:54:28.333]  Kind of like call waiting when somebody calls you and then it like cuts out for two seconds.
[03:54:28.333 --> 03:54:30.314]  That happens a lot with callers when they call in.
[03:54:30.314 --> 03:54:33.476]  We're gonna do 10 minutes of overdrive so I can finish up with Chris.
[03:54:35.083 --> 03:54:39.988]  Because this is so important, and we go back and rebroadcast, but the overdrive won't be on the AM and FM dial.
[03:54:39.988 --> 03:54:46.616]  It'll only be on the streams at Infowars.com and on the podcast we send out as well.
[03:54:46.616 --> 03:54:51.561]  Let's jam in three calls that are on the Genesis board before we end the official show.
[03:54:51.561 --> 03:54:53.543]  By the way, CNN going to break.
[03:54:54.505 --> 03:54:56.106]  The guy saw it on screen.
[03:54:56.106 --> 03:55:00.869]  The text tweet questions, aren't these town hall people terrorists?
[03:55:00.869 --> 03:55:02.910]  Shouldn't they be arrested?
[03:55:02.910 --> 03:55:05.192]  Coming back, CNN will discuss it.
[03:55:05.192 --> 03:55:12.536]  So, there's the good news of coming out with our guns and saying, look, our guns aren't illegal.
[03:55:12.536 --> 03:55:16.239]  And breaking that image that guns are illegal, because people think they're already illegal.
[03:55:16.239 --> 03:55:17.780]  We've got to stop that or it's over.
[03:55:18.826 --> 03:55:21.588]  But then they're also hyping it and using it to scare everybody.
[03:55:21.588 --> 03:55:23.809]  We'll talk about that with Chris in Overdrive.
[03:55:23.809 --> 03:55:26.291]  Let's talk to Jerry in Indiana.
[03:55:26.291 --> 03:55:29.173]  You're on the air with Chris.
[03:55:29.173 --> 03:55:31.194]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:55:31.194 --> 03:55:31.535]  Welcome.
[03:55:31.535 --> 03:55:39.500]  I appreciate what you're doing, and Chris, thank you for standing up for liberty in this country.
[03:55:39.500 --> 03:55:42.782]  If I could just throw this out here real quick.
[03:55:42.782 --> 03:55:46.785]  Here's the hypocrisy of the New World elite.
[03:55:46.785 --> 03:55:48.466]  See, Bill and Hillary Clinton
[03:55:49.173 --> 03:55:55.377]  I called their office when Clinton came out against a gun ban in 1993.
[03:55:55.377 --> 03:56:00.780]  See, they're not really against guns.
[03:56:00.780 --> 03:56:07.724]  These criminals, these Bilderbergs, these elites, they tell half-truths.
[03:56:07.724 --> 03:56:13.848]  If they were against guns, they wouldn't have their arm protection 24-7.
[03:56:13.848 --> 03:56:16.790]  Well, of course they're against our guns.
[03:56:17.446 --> 03:56:18.388]  Absolutely.
[03:56:18.388 --> 03:56:23.196]  They're against poor people owning weapons.
[03:56:23.196 --> 03:56:31.410]  If you're a rich elitist, Bilderberg, CFR, trilateralist, hey, they've got enough money to hire in, you know,
[03:56:32.704 --> 03:56:35.427]  What's the group that went to Iraq?
[03:56:35.427 --> 03:56:36.648]  Blackwater.
[03:56:36.648 --> 03:56:46.398]  I mean it came out that Sarah Brady owns guns, has bodyguards, Chuckie Schumer does, all these elitists do.
[03:56:46.398 --> 03:56:48.220]  What did Obama say in that closed meeting?
[03:56:48.220 --> 03:56:50.022]  He said these are bitter clingers.
[03:56:50.723 --> 03:56:53.003]  And all they've got left is their Bible and their gun.
[03:56:53.003 --> 03:56:59.425]  They've lost their farm, they've lost their house, but they've still got their free person who at least has a right to defend themselves.
[03:56:59.425 --> 03:57:07.886]  And they want us to be like Venezuela, or North Korea, or some place, or Nicaragua, where they can really push us around.
[03:57:07.886 --> 03:57:10.007]  Of course they cynically know that.
[03:57:10.007 --> 03:57:13.587]  Of course they cynically know the word socialist isn't the n-word.
[03:57:13.587 --> 03:57:16.228]  They just cold-bloodedly operate at that level.
[03:57:16.228 --> 03:57:17.188]  Comments on that, Chris?
[03:57:18.730 --> 03:57:29.178]  Well, another group that seems kind of funny that people that want all this national healthcare, single-payer healthcare, it's also the same crowd that doesn't want you to have a gun.
[03:57:29.178 --> 03:57:37.664]  Like, the people that want to steal from you through the government don't want you to have a weapon to be able to resist it, you know?
[03:57:37.664 --> 03:57:38.824]  Absolutely.
[03:57:38.824 --> 03:57:39.745]  You're absolutely right.
[03:57:39.745 --> 03:57:40.826]  I mean, look at it.
[03:57:40.826 --> 03:57:42.527]  The government can't even read the 1,300-page bill.
[03:57:44.332 --> 03:57:47.696]  That special interest wrote, but the government's going to be able to run our health care.
[03:57:47.696 --> 03:57:51.420]  And then they lie and say that government control isn't in the bill.
[03:57:51.420 --> 03:57:56.105]  I mean, you know, the government's lost all credibility because they've been caught lying so much.
[03:57:56.105 --> 03:57:57.186]  Thank you, Jerry.
[03:57:58.715 --> 03:58:04.337]  I'm going to give the number out for Jenny and Tessa and a few other callers for Chris in Overdrive.
[03:58:04.337 --> 03:58:04.497]  It's 888-201-2244.
[03:58:04.497 --> 03:58:06.698]  We're going to go to break here in a moment.
[03:58:06.698 --> 03:58:08.298]  Chris, come back in 10-15 minutes with you.
[03:58:14.560 --> 03:58:15.741]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:15.741 --> 03:58:16.802]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:46.274 --> 03:58:49.297]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:58:49.297 --> 03:58:54.622]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:58:54.622 --> 03:58:56.664]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:58:56.664 --> 03:59:01.668]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:59:01.668 --> 03:59:02.849]  How much do you want?
[03:59:02.849 --> 03:59:03.970]  When do you want it?
[03:59:03.970 --> 03:59:05.872]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:59:05.872 --> 03:59:06.933]  When will you need it?
[03:59:06.933 --> 03:59:08.955]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:59:09.155 --> 03:59:10.456]  Will there be any food?
[03:59:10.456 --> 03:59:11.997]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:59:11.997 --> 03:59:17.260]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:59:17.260 --> 03:59:20.843]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:59:20.843 --> 03:59:24.305]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:59:24.665 --> 03:59:25.886]  How much will you need?
[03:59:25.886 --> 03:59:26.786]  We don't know.
[03:59:26.786 --> 03:59:27.887]  How much do you want?
[03:59:27.887 --> 03:59:28.828]  All you can get.
[03:59:28.828 --> 03:59:29.908]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:59:29.908 --> 03:59:32.970]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:59:32.970 --> 03:59:34.752]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:59:34.752 --> 03:59:35.832]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:59:35.832 --> 03:59:39.915]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[04:00:13.880 --> 04:00:14.640]  All right.
[04:00:14.640 --> 04:00:18.082]  We are in overdrive through this maybe once a month or so.
[04:00:18.082 --> 04:00:20.063]  We have Chris.
[04:00:20.063 --> 04:00:26.867]  If you just joined us, Chris is the gentleman that you've seen all over national television in the white shirt, black tie.
[04:00:26.867 --> 04:00:27.687]  He's a black man.
[04:00:27.687 --> 04:00:30.429]  He's got the AR-15 strapped to his back.
[04:00:31.269 --> 04:00:38.699]  Outside an event where Obama was speaking with a dozen or so other people with firearms openly.
[04:00:38.699 --> 04:00:47.330]  Now they can legally have them concealed, but see under common law it's illegal to conceal weapons so they can give you a permit for concealed because that is illegal.
[04:00:47.330 --> 04:00:47.991]  Hiding a weapon.
[04:00:49.440 --> 04:00:51.542]  So a permit is a right to do something.
[04:00:51.542 --> 04:00:54.324]  A license is a right to do something that's illegal.
[04:00:54.324 --> 04:01:01.891]  Open carry, you don't need a license except in a very few states that have unconstitutionally and a few cities that have unconstitutionally overthrown that.
[04:01:01.891 --> 04:01:05.554]  Because if they start overthrowing the Second Amendment, all of it goes.
[04:01:05.554 --> 04:01:08.156]  That's why a lot of states haven't done that.
[04:01:08.156 --> 04:01:14.022]  It's just they create the illusion, the perception that guns are already illegal across the board.
[04:01:15.034 --> 04:01:25.089]  So going back to Chris, Chris, tell us, before we go to a few calls here, what is it like to see CNN, all these other channels, demonizing you, attacking you?
[04:01:25.089 --> 04:01:27.172]  I want to finish up with this Oberman clip as well.
[04:01:27.172 --> 04:01:29.255]  I mean, what is it like to see this happening?
[04:01:30.413 --> 04:01:32.654]  That's just business as usual for them.
[04:01:32.654 --> 04:01:33.815]  I don't watch TV.
[04:01:33.815 --> 04:01:35.096]  I don't listen to the radio.
[04:01:35.096 --> 04:01:39.298]  I don't really expose myself to any mainstream media sources.
[04:01:39.298 --> 04:01:40.479]  Because I've seen this forever.
[04:01:40.479 --> 04:01:41.500]  I've seen this my whole life.
[04:01:41.500 --> 04:01:51.866]  I mean, if you turn on the TV and you don't see that they're just trying to propagandize you and condition you and, you know, tell you what your opinion should be, I mean, you're a fool.
[04:01:51.866 --> 04:01:53.187]  I could care less what they're saying about me.
[04:01:53.829 --> 04:01:55.289]  What do you listen to?
[04:01:55.289 --> 04:01:56.790]  You say you were familiar with this show.
[04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:57.690]  You reached out to us.
[04:01:57.690 --> 04:02:00.190]  How long have you been listening to this show?
[04:02:00.190 --> 04:02:01.491]  Have you seen my films?
[04:02:01.491 --> 04:02:04.051]  How are you familiar with us?
[04:02:04.051 --> 04:02:10.313]  I've seen a bunch of your films and I listen to the show on my cell phone every once in a while.
[04:02:10.313 --> 04:02:19.455]  If I'm out somewhere and just to kill some time, I'll listen to the show through my cell phone with the number you can call.
[04:02:20.294 --> 04:02:21.515]  So you're a fan of Ron Paul?
[04:02:48.027 --> 04:02:49.388]  Oh, big time fan of Ron Paul.
[04:02:49.388 --> 04:02:55.372]  I think he's the only, you know, as far as I can think of off the top of my head right now, he's the only honest politician we've ever had.
[04:02:55.372 --> 04:03:02.918]  The only one that's, you know, cares anything about obeying his oath to the Constitution, and as far as I know, he has the perfect voting record.
[04:03:02.918 --> 04:03:05.260]  Constitutional voting record, so.
[04:03:05.260 --> 04:03:06.060]  Well, exactly.
[04:03:06.060 --> 04:03:14.847]  I mean, a Dennis Kucinich, you can like him because he's real, and because he actually does what he says he'll do, and he makes some good stands, but then he wants our guns.
[04:03:17.159 --> 04:03:20.400]  Yeah, I mean, he's a true believer, but he's really dangerous in that respect.
[04:03:20.400 --> 04:03:28.682]  And then you've got a Cynthia McKinney who will expose government-wide slavery rings and corruption and some of the bad things Israel's doing with Zionism and things.
[04:03:28.682 --> 04:03:29.802]  But then she won't.
[04:03:29.802 --> 04:03:31.663]  She also wants our guns.
[04:03:31.663 --> 04:03:32.963]  Now, I like Cindy Sheehan.
[04:03:32.963 --> 04:03:36.284]  She finally gets it and says, yeah, we have a tyrannical government.
[04:03:36.284 --> 04:03:37.864]  We shouldn't have any gun control.
[04:03:37.864 --> 04:03:40.445]  Somebody like a Cindy Sheehan's a real person.
[04:03:40.445 --> 04:03:43.446]  You know, she's come a long way in her process.
[04:03:44.586 --> 04:03:51.272]  But I don't understand how anybody wouldn't understand, fundamentally, we need to all be armed.
[04:03:51.272 --> 04:03:53.314]  Absolutely.
[04:03:53.314 --> 04:03:56.697]  If you're a good, honest person, wouldn't you want to be armed?
[04:03:56.697 --> 04:03:58.118]  I mean, the bad guys have guns.
[04:03:58.118 --> 04:04:09.748]  If you're a good, honest person and you know you'd never harm anybody that wasn't trying to harm you, why not stack the odds in our favor and go out and learn some gun safety and get yourself some guns?
[04:04:09.748 --> 04:04:11.590]  You know?
[04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.910]  Why not?
[04:04:14.090 --> 04:04:25.059]  Chris, what would you like to say to CNN and others that are posting these questions for the audience of, you know, is Chris and these people basically, are they terrorists?
[04:04:25.059 --> 04:04:28.722]  They're coming out and saying, and then by extension, oh, look, they've got guns.
[04:04:28.722 --> 04:04:29.963]  Are they terrorists?
[04:04:29.963 --> 04:04:30.323]  And then they...
[04:04:31.004 --> 04:04:35.528]  Well, I guess I would say that, in my opinion, the term terrorist
[04:04:57.970 --> 04:05:05.053]  Today is used to, uh, is applied to people that are just resisting occupation, resisting oppression.
[04:05:05.053 --> 04:05:07.194]  So, I mean, that's what I'm doing.
[04:05:07.194 --> 04:05:08.834]  So if that's what I am, that's what I am.
[04:05:08.834 --> 04:05:13.376]  But, I mean, I have no intention to harm anybody that's not attacking me.
[04:05:13.376 --> 04:05:15.757]  You know, my weapons are for defense.
[04:05:15.757 --> 04:05:17.518]  They're not for defending myself from criminals.
[04:05:17.518 --> 04:05:20.759]  Because, you know, honestly, I haven't really been a victim of much crime in my life.
[04:05:20.759 --> 04:05:23.600]  I've been a victim of government crime, crime from the state.
[04:05:24.372 --> 04:05:28.134]  But, that's what my guns are for, is to pretend that's what the Second Amendment was written for.
[04:05:28.134 --> 04:05:30.255]  It was written to protect people from the government.
[04:05:30.255 --> 04:05:40.619]  It was so that when they get out of control, we can, you know, do what we have to do to get them, you know, any means necessary to stop them from controlling us.
[04:05:40.619 --> 04:05:43.741]  Any means necessary, that's the Malcolm X quote, so you believe in that?
[04:05:44.582 --> 04:05:46.043]  I absolutely believe in that.
[04:05:46.043 --> 04:05:46.964]  Absolutely.
[04:05:46.964 --> 04:05:53.408]  You're only as free as you're willing... I say this to people and it sounds kind of extreme, but you're only as free as you're willing to, you know, pull a trigger.
[04:05:53.408 --> 04:05:55.630]  That's as free as you are.
[04:05:55.630 --> 04:06:00.774]  When you pick the line where you're willing to pull a trigger, that's how free you are.
[04:06:00.774 --> 04:06:02.035]  Well, it is the willingness.
[04:06:02.035 --> 04:06:11.622]  That's what our founders did and that's why FEMA... Have you ever seen the footage we got from a fireman of FEMA in Kansas City teaching police and firemen that the founders were bad and that America's bad?
[04:06:12.518 --> 04:06:13.799]  No, I haven't seen that.
[04:06:13.799 --> 04:06:18.982]  I mean, you find so much stuff, it's like, you know, getting into all of it, it'd be like a full-time job, man.
[04:06:18.982 --> 04:06:21.623]  You're exposing so much stuff.
[04:06:21.623 --> 04:06:23.704]  Well, no, I'm just, I mean, I'm backing up what you're saying.
[04:06:23.704 --> 04:06:33.309]  I mean, you've seen the DHS report we broke and the MIAC report, where they say gun owners, period, and returning vets are what Homeland Security's main mission is.
[04:06:33.309 --> 04:06:36.571]  I mean, we knew day one this was set up for the American people.
[04:06:36.571 --> 04:06:38.552]  Now they just admit it.
[04:06:38.552 --> 04:06:39.953]  I say they're the terrorists.
[04:06:40.509 --> 04:06:51.279]  Yeah, they're just trying to... In fact, I don't know if this is even true, but I read some definition on the term terrorist that it was originally meant to apply to, like, governments attacking their own people.
[04:06:51.279 --> 04:06:52.820]  Yes.
[04:06:52.820 --> 04:06:54.642]  I haven't done much more research.
[04:06:54.642 --> 04:06:58.005]  I've got to look into it more, but, I mean, what else is there to say?
[04:06:58.005 --> 04:06:59.807]  That's really what the true definition of it is, then.
[04:06:59.807 --> 04:07:02.009]  I don't know.
[04:07:04.295 --> 04:07:11.980]  Well, you know, it's really a travesty that so many people don't understand the basics of liberty.
[04:07:11.980 --> 04:07:14.702]  But at the same time, are you buoyed?
[04:07:14.702 --> 04:07:15.843]  I mean, are you excited?
[04:07:15.843 --> 04:07:20.486]  Are you seeing a huge awakening taking place?
[04:07:20.486 --> 04:07:22.367]  Oh, I'm actually... I don't know.
[04:07:22.367 --> 04:07:25.049]  There's like a lot of different feelings.
[04:07:25.049 --> 04:07:27.030]  One thing I'm definitely disappointed in is
[04:07:28.547 --> 04:07:32.749]  The majority of the Second Amendment movement.
[04:07:32.749 --> 04:07:38.633]  You know, for a long time I thought the pro-gun crowd was the crowd that kind of got it a little bit.
[04:07:38.633 --> 04:07:45.056]  And I'm coming to the realization that most people in the Second Amendment movement, they're not really for gun rights.
[04:07:45.056 --> 04:07:46.697]  They're not really for defense.
[04:07:46.697 --> 04:07:49.999]  They don't really understand what the real purpose of the Second Amendment was.
[04:07:49.999 --> 04:07:51.460]  They're just gun enthusiasts.
[04:07:51.460 --> 04:07:53.141]  They're like people that collect Beanie Babies.
[04:07:53.141 --> 04:07:54.721]  They collect guns instead.
[04:07:54.721 --> 04:07:55.502]  And they could care less.
[04:07:55.942 --> 04:07:59.604]  You know, they want a government that's going to allow them to have guns.
[04:07:59.604 --> 04:08:02.004]  But if the government ever says no, they're not going to do anything.
[04:08:02.004 --> 04:08:03.065]  They're just going to hand them right over.
[04:08:03.065 --> 04:08:06.166]  And they're basically worthless.
[04:08:06.166 --> 04:08:07.087]  They contribute nothing.
[04:08:07.087 --> 04:08:08.427]  They're just in the way.
[04:08:08.427 --> 04:08:21.812]  If you want to be a part of a real Second Amendment, you know, a group that stands up for your right to protect yourself with firearms, there's groups like Gun Owners of America, ABCDL, JPFO.
[04:08:21.812 --> 04:08:23.153]  These are like the real gun groups.
[04:08:23.803 --> 04:08:29.469]  The NRA has done a lot because they're so big, but they're not really... that's like the beginner.
[04:08:29.469 --> 04:08:34.955]  If you're into guns and you're kind of a beginner in the Second Amendment movement, that's where the beginners go.
[04:08:34.955 --> 04:08:37.838]  When you want to elevate things, you go to the other groups.
[04:08:37.838 --> 04:08:39.540]  Well, it's worse than that.
[04:08:39.540 --> 04:08:45.466]  I finally got Gun Owners of America to come out with the history and the documents that they had and we had.
[04:08:46.874 --> 04:08:50.176]  Because the NRA was founded by the federal government.
[04:08:50.176 --> 04:09:00.704]  The NRA actually supported the 68 Gun Control Act, the basis of the nightmare we live under today, that they've expanded the NICs and all the rest of this registration.
[04:09:00.704 --> 04:09:02.885]  So they're actually a Judas goat.
[04:09:02.885 --> 04:09:06.047]  How do you get 150 million gun owners to give up their rights?
[04:09:06.047 --> 04:09:10.931]  You have a group that claims they represent you that leads you to the slaughter.
[04:09:10.931 --> 04:09:12.512]  Exactly.
[04:09:12.512 --> 04:09:12.912]  Exactly.
[04:09:14.207 --> 04:09:16.268]  And those are the same people that are coming out against me.
[04:09:16.268 --> 04:09:17.809]  I've been a lifelong NRA member.
[04:09:17.809 --> 04:09:20.611]  I don't need to hear anything else you have to say, because I know what your position is.
[04:09:20.611 --> 04:09:21.751]  You're an enthusiast.
[04:09:21.751 --> 04:09:25.814]  You're not an activist.
[04:09:25.814 --> 04:09:27.374]  Well, they do like a nanny around.
[04:09:27.374 --> 04:09:30.556]  I remember they had a bill in 1998.
[04:09:30.556 --> 04:09:35.319]  The Texas Legislature was in the Dallas Morning News.
[04:09:35.319 --> 04:09:38.661]  And we were fighting it again in 2000, next time it was in session.
[04:09:39.941 --> 04:09:50.977]  And the bill would ban junior shooting sports in Texas, shut down private transfer, they call it gun show loophole, but it wouldn't let me shell a gun to my neighbor, or buy a gun from my dad, or anything.
[04:09:50.977 --> 04:09:55.563]  And would create, you know, all this, many times worse than the 68 gun control act.
[04:09:56.383 --> 04:10:02.205]  And the NRA wasn't sending lobbyists, and I was down there with the hundreds of people.
[04:10:02.205 --> 04:10:04.166]  There'd be 300 of us to speak against it.
[04:10:04.166 --> 04:10:07.828]  They'd have four paid guys playing the race card.
[04:10:07.828 --> 04:10:11.769]  They got gang-banging type black guys to come up and go, we're dangerous.
[04:10:11.769 --> 04:10:12.630]  We're gang members.
[04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:15.231]  We can buy guns cheap and do stuff.
[04:10:15.231 --> 04:10:17.692]  And then the liberals brought them out and paid them off in the hall.
[04:10:18.092 --> 04:10:19.192]  I went and got video of it.
[04:10:19.192 --> 04:10:21.273]  They were using the black guys as like a race car.
[04:10:21.273 --> 04:10:23.214]  Oh look, scary black people.
[04:10:23.214 --> 04:10:23.954]  They've got guns.
[04:10:23.954 --> 04:10:24.975]  You want to ban them?
[04:10:24.975 --> 04:10:27.075]  Wouldn't let our 300 people speak.
[04:10:27.075 --> 04:10:28.816]  But luckily I caught the bribery.
[04:10:28.816 --> 04:10:37.860]  And then the NRA attacked us in the Dallas Morning News and said we were extreme, that they were neutral on the gun bills.
[04:10:37.860 --> 04:10:40.901]  So see, they are actually a vicious anti-gun group.
[04:10:41.681 --> 04:10:50.608]  See, they'll put out rhetoric there for it, Chris, but then when it comes time to actually do something, that's when you find out they're agents.
[04:10:50.608 --> 04:10:51.729]  I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[04:10:51.729 --> 04:10:57.314]  All I know is all their members, all their members are opposed to what I did and all the real gun groups are, you know, applauding me.
[04:10:58.371 --> 04:11:01.193]  ABCDL, you know, wants to give me an honorary life membership.
[04:11:01.193 --> 04:11:03.335]  I mean, these are the real pro-gun groups.
[04:11:03.335 --> 04:11:04.936]  The no-compromise gun groups.
[04:11:04.936 --> 04:11:12.041]  If the NRA was doing its job and really educating all of its members, the gun debate wouldn't even be an issue.
[04:11:12.041 --> 04:11:14.543]  There would be no gun debate in this country.
[04:11:14.543 --> 04:11:20.928]  We got 150 plus million gun owners, 400 million guns, we rule this country, it's ours!
[04:11:20.928 --> 04:11:22.849]  Exactly, exactly.
[04:11:22.849 --> 04:11:25.071]  If it wasn't for these weak, you know,
[04:11:26.704 --> 04:11:30.767]  These people that are sugarcoating everything and giving, you know, sending this weak little message.
[04:11:30.767 --> 04:11:31.728]  No compromise.
[04:11:31.728 --> 04:11:34.730]  We can't compromise at all on this.
[04:11:34.730 --> 04:11:36.571]  Let's take a call from Jenny in Idaho.
[04:11:36.571 --> 04:11:40.154]  You're on the air with Chris, a modern American hero, for the Second Amendment.
[04:11:40.154 --> 04:11:42.115]  Go ahead.
[04:11:42.115 --> 04:11:44.177]  Chris, you're my hero.
[04:11:44.177 --> 04:11:45.678]  Wow.
[04:11:45.678 --> 04:11:46.759]  Thank you.
[04:11:46.759 --> 04:11:49.341]  I am wearing my gun now, out in public.
[04:11:49.341 --> 04:11:51.222]  I'm in an open carry state.
[04:11:52.557 --> 04:11:59.946]  And Alex, I want to know, when do I get my Chris t-shirt that says, Protect Your Second Amendment, Show Me Your Gun?
[04:11:59.946 --> 04:12:03.290]  Well, I mean, there's so many great t-shirt ideas.
[04:12:03.290 --> 04:12:04.131]  I don't want to be on a t-shirt.
[04:12:04.131 --> 04:12:05.252]  I don't want to be on a t-shirt.
[04:12:08.174 --> 04:12:09.695]  You don't want to be on the t-shirt, Chris?
[04:12:09.695 --> 04:12:11.875]  No, I don't want to be on t-shirts.
[04:12:11.875 --> 04:12:20.339]  CNN's already using you for their anti-gun agenda, so... You know, you might want to go on CNN or Fox.
[04:12:20.339 --> 04:12:23.060]  Jenny, hold on one second, we'll go back to you.
[04:12:23.060 --> 04:12:35.945]  You might want to go on these channels, just with talking points, and just stick to those, but only agree to do it live, so they can't edit you, because right now they're only going one way with it, but
[04:12:36.966 --> 04:12:39.707]  I guess at the end of the day, you're getting your info out, so it doesn't matter.
[04:12:39.707 --> 04:12:41.809]  But Jenny, go ahead.
[04:12:41.809 --> 04:12:49.332]  I'd like to challenge everybody in an open carry state to start wearing their guns.
[04:12:49.332 --> 04:12:54.155]  I'd like to challenge everybody that's not in an open carry state to go wear your guns.
[04:12:54.155 --> 04:12:58.637]  And if you have to group together to do it, and do it in large numbers, then do it that way.
[04:12:58.637 --> 04:13:05.441]  Well, people should be, the reason I say it takes a lot of courage, and he's a hero, and the fella in New Hampshire is too.
[04:13:06.576 --> 04:13:12.100]  Is because the government will try to provocateur, especially if they know it's a predestined event.
[04:13:12.100 --> 04:13:20.146]  And I would look for them to try something, but we can't not go out and engage them and demand our rights by exercising them.
[04:13:20.146 --> 04:13:22.168]  Rights are not given, they're taken.
[04:13:22.168 --> 04:13:25.030]  They're taking them from us, we gotta take them back.
[04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:27.291]  And so, in fact, pull up the Frederick Douglass quote.
[04:13:27.291 --> 04:13:30.714]  I want the exact quote about Frederick Douglass, rights are taken, not given.
[04:13:30.714 --> 04:13:32.555]  I want to get the exact quote up on screen.
[04:13:32.555 --> 04:13:33.756]  Thanks guys, Frederick Douglass.
[04:13:36.451 --> 04:13:39.413]  Look, they're going to do what they're going to do.
[04:13:39.413 --> 04:13:40.894]  We're going to have to do what we're going to do.
[04:13:40.894 --> 04:13:46.999]  But we can't just sit here and let the world go past us as spectators.
[04:13:46.999 --> 04:13:50.341]  And so I commend what he's doing.
[04:13:50.341 --> 04:13:54.844]  I would say, though, I've seen cases, one in Colorado that's an open carry.
[04:13:54.844 --> 04:13:56.405]  This guy went to a rally with one.
[04:13:56.405 --> 04:14:00.989]  They went ahead and arrested him, set him up, sent him to prison, even though there wasn't a law.
[04:14:00.989 --> 04:14:04.111]  It's like Kelly Rushing in Lyon County, Kentucky.
[04:14:04.111 --> 04:14:04.932]  He was in the newspaper.
[04:14:05.772 --> 04:14:07.193]  This is one of many cases.
[04:14:07.193 --> 04:14:12.077]  He gave a state police officer a video with Ron Paul on it and then one of my films after it.
[04:14:12.077 --> 04:14:24.766]  They indicted him for the Ron Paul video that was listed in the court and my film Road to Tyranny and they said the officers felt threatened by the content was anti-law enforcement.
[04:14:24.766 --> 04:14:26.227]  So I called the judge up at home
[04:14:27.148 --> 04:14:41.623]  And I said, because it was his number and information, and I said, well, I'm not getting in your trial, but is this newspaper article accurate that you are presiding over a trial over somebody giving somebody an Alex Jones, Ron Paul video?
[04:14:41.623 --> 04:14:43.825]  And he said, yes, that trial's coming up next week.
[04:14:43.825 --> 04:14:44.766]  I'm not going to talk to you about it.
[04:14:45.487 --> 04:14:46.848]  And I said, you gotta be kidding me.
[04:14:46.848 --> 04:14:49.110]  And I said, okay.
[04:14:49.110 --> 04:14:51.812]  I just couldn't believe this news article I was faxed.
[04:14:51.812 --> 04:14:59.138]  And then I talked to Kelly Rushing, upstanding member of the community, no criminal record.
[04:14:59.138 --> 04:15:01.580]  And when the cops came and arrested him, they laughed at him.
[04:15:02.574 --> 04:15:05.536]  When he was in the car and said, you're going to prison for giving me that video.
[04:15:05.536 --> 04:15:07.358]  I mean, they're crazy!
[04:15:07.358 --> 04:15:10.120]  So, do we stop giving videotapes out?
[04:15:10.120 --> 04:15:13.903]  That was like six years ago, so it was a VHS tape.
[04:15:13.903 --> 04:15:19.067]  I mean, do we stop giving videos out because the police say they're illegal?
[04:15:19.067 --> 04:15:23.451]  I mean, do we stop putting signs up on street corners because they say it's illegal?
[04:15:23.451 --> 04:15:26.033]  Do we just bend over completely to them?
[04:15:26.033 --> 04:15:27.154]  I mean, that's the big question.
[04:15:27.854 --> 04:15:29.314]  Good to hear from you, Jenny.
[04:15:29.314 --> 04:15:30.435]  I appreciate your call.
[04:15:30.435 --> 04:15:34.136]  Closing comments along those lines, Chris?
[04:15:34.136 --> 04:15:36.336]  No, I do have one closing comment I'd like to say.
[04:15:36.336 --> 04:15:42.298]  I'd just like to thank the Phoenix Police Department for handling everything in the most professional way they possibly could.
[04:15:42.298 --> 04:15:45.418]  I think they're the most professional police department in the country.
[04:15:45.418 --> 04:15:48.759]  Now, I did notice they did have some armed officers around you.
[04:15:48.759 --> 04:15:50.980]  Were they federal marshals or were they Phoenix?
[04:15:52.193 --> 04:15:56.715]  I think they were just like Phoenix detectives or something, but they were awesome.
[04:15:56.715 --> 04:16:02.317]  We had some discussions and chit-chatted a little bit, and they said, we're here to make sure no one jumps on you.
[04:16:02.317 --> 04:16:03.958]  We're not at all concerned about what you're doing.
[04:16:03.958 --> 04:16:18.104]  Yeah, their body language, because I've watched the tapes, was friendly, and they seemed excited, and they were looking at you approvingly, so it sounds like they're actually some good people.
[04:16:18.104 --> 04:16:19.925]  Specifically, tell me about your chit-chat.
[04:16:21.825 --> 04:16:29.248]  Uh, I had, a lot of them were coming up to me and telling me, everyone's asking me, if you can do this, can you do this, can you do this?
[04:16:29.248 --> 04:16:36.532]  And, you know, one of them said, he said, don't tell him I said this, but I think what you're doing is awesome.
[04:16:36.532 --> 04:16:38.492]  And he said, I'm all for it.
[04:16:38.492 --> 04:16:41.934]  And it was nothing but positive things from the Phoenix Police Department.
[04:16:41.934 --> 04:16:42.994]  They were outstanding.
[04:16:42.994 --> 04:16:46.176]  They said, we would rather be out here, you know, our job is to
[04:16:47.498 --> 04:16:50.099]  Our job is to make peace, is to keep the peace.
[04:16:50.099 --> 04:16:51.199]  That's all we're here for.
[04:16:51.199 --> 04:16:53.720]  And you have every right to be here exercising your views.
[04:16:53.720 --> 04:16:58.321]  And the other side, all these people have the right to express their views.
[04:16:58.321 --> 04:17:01.262]  And our job here is only to keep the peace.
[04:17:01.262 --> 04:17:02.422]  And I was just blown away.
[04:17:02.422 --> 04:17:05.924]  I was, you know, because I come from Cleveland, Ohio.
[04:17:05.924 --> 04:17:09.525]  And Cleveland, Ohio, their job is not to keep the peace.
[04:17:09.525 --> 04:17:11.785]  You know, they do whatever the heck they want.
[04:17:11.785 --> 04:17:14.126]  And I'm just very proud of Phoenix Police Department.
[04:17:16.161 --> 04:17:25.572]  Well, yeah, I mean, I saw that on the video, the police officers, the body language was, you know, nine, nine tenths of communication is nonverbal was we love this guy.
[04:17:25.572 --> 04:17:26.713]  This is great.
[04:17:26.713 --> 04:17:33.821]  But if you to come out there with a mask and dress like a clown and camo, I mean, camo is for Southeast Asia.
[04:17:34.721 --> 04:17:37.944]  These people do it and then it just looks clownish.
[04:18:04.401 --> 04:18:13.286]  You know, a hundred different hillbilly groups going, and like their wives going, Mr. President, the Admiral's here, and he pulls up with a bass boat, and I'm not even joking.
[04:18:13.286 --> 04:18:21.570]  You know, that, that discredits everyone, but you out there, clean cut, well spoken, with it strapped to your back, that's a good image.
[04:18:21.570 --> 04:18:28.554]  I predict they're going to send people out in masks, they're going to send provocateurs out, they're really scared of this, but we keep catching them.
[04:18:28.554 --> 04:18:33.237]  Denver cops we caught provocateuring, we caught the Ottawa police, they caught the British doing it.
[04:18:33.837 --> 04:18:37.159]  So they're kind of scared of provocateuring because they know we're looking for it.
[04:18:37.159 --> 04:18:39.361]  See, now we're in the game.
[04:18:39.361 --> 04:18:40.422]  Now we know the game.
[04:18:40.422 --> 04:18:42.583]  It's not like our first season of football.
[04:18:42.583 --> 04:18:54.311]  We've gone through peewee league and now we're, you know, into the junior high stuff and we're about to go into varsity and then we're going to go into the college and pro level and the global has been playing the pro level for a long time.
[04:18:54.311 --> 04:18:55.412]  We are quickly
[04:18:56.573 --> 04:19:04.515]  Coming up in the next few years, on every level, no matter what they do, all their little tricks and programs are now being exposed.
[04:19:04.515 --> 04:19:05.416]  You see what I'm saying, Chris?
[04:19:05.416 --> 04:19:07.556]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[04:19:07.556 --> 04:19:15.679]  I also think that armed citizens at these events, you know, kind of discourage provocateurs from causing trouble.
[04:19:15.679 --> 04:19:21.420]  Because now it's not just, you know, they can run into a crowd and mace people and there's nothing they can do, or they can throw rocks and throw bottles.
[04:19:21.420 --> 04:19:26.182]  Well now there's armed people, armed good people in the crowd, that can fight back or, you know,
[04:19:28.050 --> 04:19:31.598]  Well, I like the fact... It's dangerous for a provocateur now.
[04:19:31.598 --> 04:19:32.360]  Say that again, I'm sorry.
[04:19:32.360 --> 04:19:35.106]  It's dangerous for a provocateur?
[04:19:35.106 --> 04:19:37.651]  With armed people in the crowd, it's dangerous for a provocateur.
[04:19:38.735 --> 04:19:45.017]  Well, this is the spirit of 1776 rising again, Chris, and we commend your courage.
[04:19:45.017 --> 04:19:50.719]  And I think it's an important message to the establishment and to the Minions and to the Communist Parasite Ramble.
[04:19:50.719 --> 04:19:53.000]  We're done playing games.
[04:19:53.000 --> 04:19:59.883]  And they wanted to have Obama's youth brigades with M16s training the youth for this to be used against us.
[04:19:59.883 --> 04:20:03.244]  And I think it fundamentally freaks them out to see
[04:20:04.264 --> 04:20:11.929]  You guys out there with this much courage, but I think real men and women resonate with the courage and knew what it took for you to come out there and do it.
[04:20:11.929 --> 04:20:17.073]  Plus, the police are like, there's already concealed weapons all over the place out there.
[04:20:17.073 --> 04:20:17.814]  They know how stupid it is.
[04:20:17.814 --> 04:20:20.275]  There's thousands of guns out there.
[04:20:20.275 --> 04:20:21.196]  Go ahead, sorry.
[04:20:21.196 --> 04:20:23.377]  I just said there could have been thousands of guns concealed out there.
[04:20:23.377 --> 04:20:23.938]  We have no idea.
[04:20:25.046 --> 04:20:25.886]  But I mean, that's my point.
[04:20:25.886 --> 04:20:27.126]  You're in the middle of downtown Phoenix.
[04:20:27.126 --> 04:20:28.247]  There were thousands of guns.
[04:20:28.247 --> 04:20:30.807]  That's one of the most popular concealed carry states.
[04:20:30.807 --> 04:20:31.987]  I've seen the numbers.
[04:20:31.987 --> 04:20:34.848]  In fact, it's one of the top states for people carrying firearms concealed.
[04:20:34.848 --> 04:20:35.048]  I know.
[04:20:35.048 --> 04:20:36.148]  I've seen that.
[04:20:36.148 --> 04:20:44.369]  So, you know, that's the issue I'm trying to make here is the police live in a gun world, so they know there's already guns everywhere.
[04:20:44.369 --> 04:20:50.550]  They would rather see the rifle, the handgun, out in the open because that means you're in defense.
[04:20:50.550 --> 04:20:52.131]  That means I'm out in the open.
[04:20:52.131 --> 04:20:53.131]  I'm armed.
[04:20:53.131 --> 04:20:54.651]  I'm here to keep the peace as a citizen.
[04:20:55.211 --> 04:21:02.639]  As a militiaman, you don't go run around in the woods and worship some commander, you know, who...
[04:21:04.130 --> 04:21:05.831]  Tells you, you know, how great Hitler is.
[04:21:05.831 --> 04:21:07.392]  He's probably a federal officer.
[04:21:07.392 --> 04:21:09.174]  That's not being in the militia.
[04:21:09.174 --> 04:21:13.417]  Being in the militia is doing what you did out there openly.
[04:21:13.417 --> 04:21:20.722]  And so, again, this is a shift, a paradigm shift that's happening to where I didn't even recognize the paradigm shift.
[04:21:20.722 --> 04:21:24.665]  I know about concealed carry, I mean about open carry, but when
[04:21:25.686 --> 04:21:38.913]  I've talked about how important it is but when I got reports guy with an earpiece out there with a gun I immediately thought provocateur because I didn't even gauge the amount of courage to go to a presidential event and do it.
[04:21:38.913 --> 04:21:40.114]  The boldness of it
[04:21:41.315 --> 04:21:53.962]  I wasn't even ready to deal with, and we still need to look out for groups and people, and there are a lot of covert agendas going on, and it's all very complex, and the enemy's very, very treacherous.
[04:21:53.962 --> 04:22:02.607]  But this is just so exciting, what's happening, and again, a free man would have his sword or his rifle openly on him.
[04:22:02.607 --> 04:22:06.909]  It's the criminals, the murderers, what police, even 50 years ago, 100 years ago,
[04:22:08.450 --> 04:22:11.233]  We're looking for was somebody with a hidden weapon.
[04:22:11.233 --> 04:22:12.715]  The bad guys have it hidden.
[04:22:12.715 --> 04:22:13.796]  That was the rule.
[04:22:13.796 --> 04:22:15.618]  The good guys have it in the open.
[04:22:15.618 --> 04:22:18.561]  You have your weapon out in the open.
[04:22:18.561 --> 04:22:22.204]  But see, they made it out of style, uncool to carry.
[04:22:22.204 --> 04:22:24.066]  That's why in the famous Lindbergh trial,
[04:22:24.667 --> 04:22:33.116]  You know, everybody, you can watch the newsreels, had their guns in the front row, you know, and people were saying, well, how can you let Lindbergh in?
[04:22:33.116 --> 04:22:35.739]  He may shoot the guy that kidnapped the baby.
[04:22:35.739 --> 04:22:40.124]  But the issue was we've gone from guns in court to my dad just...
[04:22:40.925 --> 04:22:42.806]  That was a 10 minute rant, I apologize.
[04:23:05.401 --> 04:23:08.904]  Well listen, tell me more about the Phoenix Police.
[04:23:08.904 --> 04:23:10.305]  That's a good headline for us.
[04:23:10.305 --> 04:23:19.332]  Phoenix Police told Chris, told Open Carry demonstrator at Obama event that they supported you.
[04:23:19.332 --> 04:23:20.153]  What else did they say?
[04:23:20.153 --> 04:23:22.194]  That was about it.
[04:23:22.194 --> 04:23:23.495]  I mean, that was everything.
[04:23:23.495 --> 04:23:27.799]  Just that they were just there to keep the peace and they had no problem with what we were doing.
[04:23:27.799 --> 04:23:29.100]  That's it.
[04:23:29.100 --> 04:23:32.402]  And of course there were other guys.
[04:23:32.402 --> 04:23:34.284]  Did you know the other guys that were out there armed?
[04:23:35.431 --> 04:23:41.693]  Uh, just, I, uh, was acquainted, kind of, loosely acquainted with the other people.
[04:23:41.693 --> 04:23:44.734]  Just a few, just like three or four other people there.
[04:23:44.734 --> 04:23:49.335]  And the police didn't pull anybody over, follow them home, or none of that?
[04:23:49.335 --> 04:23:50.155]  No, not at all.
[04:23:50.155 --> 04:23:51.855]  They didn't even ask for anyone's information.
[04:23:51.855 --> 04:23:53.856]  I didn't even have any identification on me.
[04:23:53.856 --> 04:23:57.177]  I had purposely left cell phone keys, ID, everything at home.
[04:23:57.861 --> 04:24:00.082]  Now look at England.
[04:24:00.082 --> 04:24:02.684]  First they say we're gonna line everybody up and ask you questions.
[04:24:02.684 --> 04:24:07.566]  It's happened to me, it's happened to both the Watson brothers who live there, happens to their parents, happens to everybody now.
[04:24:07.566 --> 04:24:10.087]  They just go, excuse me, line up, checking IDs, thank you.
[04:24:10.087 --> 04:24:11.448]  Are you a terrorist?
[04:24:11.448 --> 04:24:12.789]  Are you a pedophile?
[04:24:12.789 --> 04:24:21.113]  And I had the Wall Street Journal writer here, that happened to her repeatedly when she was in England doing a story about tourism.
[04:24:21.113 --> 04:24:25.716]  I mean, it's just everywhere and now under the TSA model from
[04:24:26.616 --> 04:24:41.469]  The airports, they admit that airport model of being searched, submitting, the act of prostration, taking your shoes off, the act of submitting, the act of being... This is all about training us to where you're not even nervous now.
[04:24:41.469 --> 04:24:45.313]  If you fly a lot, you're like, no big deal, go to the checkpoint, you're not nervous.
[04:24:45.313 --> 04:24:47.234]  They're pleased by that.
[04:24:47.234 --> 04:24:50.477]  Ah, the enslavement is going well!
[04:24:50.477 --> 04:24:51.178]  Comments on that?
[04:24:52.375 --> 04:24:53.818]  Uh, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[04:24:53.818 --> 04:24:58.888]  A good example of that is, uh, there's a Border Patrol checkpoint in, uh, I think it's between, uh...
[04:24:59.548 --> 04:25:07.150]  Between Gila Bend and it's just west of Gila Bend, I believe, and I think it's like 60 or 70 miles away from the border.
[04:25:07.150 --> 04:25:14.132]  And my pastor, Baptist pastor, actually got beat up by the Border Patrol at that checkpoint, which has nothing to do with the border.
[04:25:14.132 --> 04:25:16.092]  It doesn't even run north and south.
[04:25:16.092 --> 04:25:18.593]  And all they do is just ask you whether you're a citizen or not.
[04:25:18.593 --> 04:25:26.415]  And I believe at this checkpoint, the only purpose of it is to get us used to stopping throughout our daily lives and answering questions to federal agents.
[04:25:26.415 --> 04:25:28.836]  And yeah, so I know exactly what you're talking about.
[04:25:29.198 --> 04:25:30.780]  Oh, it's been documented, as you know.
[04:25:30.780 --> 04:25:32.422]  They just waved the illegals through.
[04:25:32.422 --> 04:25:35.845]  But they see a family of Americans, black, white, Hispanic.
[04:25:35.845 --> 04:25:41.051]  It's like, we're going to have one hell of a time today, boy!
[04:25:41.051 --> 04:25:42.873]  Going to teach them how to be slaves.
[04:25:42.873 --> 04:25:44.535]  Now I'm starting to clear a picture.
[04:25:44.535 --> 04:25:47.258]  You go to Pastor Anderson's church, I see.
[04:25:47.258 --> 04:25:48.719]  Yeah, I do.
[04:25:48.719 --> 04:25:49.100]  Proudly.
[04:25:49.100 --> 04:25:50.261]  I think it's the best church in the world.
[04:25:52.037 --> 04:25:59.246]  So, more and more, he's the pastor beat up within an inch of his life for just asking the lordships.
[04:25:59.246 --> 04:26:03.411]  How is that going with him right now?
[04:26:03.411 --> 04:26:04.392]  It's just a circus.
[04:26:04.392 --> 04:26:08.077]  The whole court process is just a total circus.
[04:26:08.077 --> 04:26:11.461]  I couldn't even begin to explain how ludicrous it is.
[04:26:13.663 --> 04:26:31.949]  Well, this has been an amazing interview and I appreciate you spending time with us today and I look forward to having you back on as this develops and as this unfolds and we just appreciate you, Chris, and your courage doing this.
[04:26:31.949 --> 04:26:35.331]  It just shows how one person can change the world.
[04:26:35.331 --> 04:26:35.911]  The guy in
[04:26:37.714 --> 04:26:40.175]  New Hampshire starts it, it spreads to Arizona.
[04:26:40.175 --> 04:26:44.036]  Now people all over the country are doing hope and carry.
[04:26:44.036 --> 04:26:47.937]  And the illusion, the grip of enslavement is loosening.
[04:26:47.937 --> 04:26:50.998]  But the enemy's getting ready to counter strike against all of us.
[04:26:50.998 --> 04:26:54.139]  So pray for Chris, pray for myself, pray for my whole crew.
[04:26:54.139 --> 04:26:59.941]  Pray for what we're doing because I didn't spend any time on it today, but the enemy's coming after us at every level.
[04:26:59.941 --> 04:27:02.101]  I have felt a disturbance in the force as well.
[04:27:02.101 --> 04:27:04.262]  So we'll see you back live tomorrow.
[04:27:04.262 --> 04:27:05.823]  Retransmission starts now.
[04:27:05.823 --> 04:27:06.803]  Thank you so much, Chris.
[04:27:07.768 --> 04:27:08.268]  No problem.
[04:27:08.268 --> 04:27:09.428]  Thanks, Alex.
[04:27:09.428 --> 04:27:10.769]  Take care, buddy.
[04:27:10.769 --> 04:27:18.511]  It's great to be real, great to be alive, great to be part of the second American Revolution to restore the Republic, the spirit of 1776.
[04:27:18.511 --> 04:27:19.471]  Don't tread on me.
[04:27:19.471 --> 04:27:20.571]  Great job, crew.
[04:27:20.571 --> 04:27:25.912]  Sweet Lucy was a dancer, but no one was her dancer.
[04:27:40.328 --> 04:27:40.889]  Yeah!
