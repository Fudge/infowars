[00:00:05.157 --> 00:00:09.999]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:11.579]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.140]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.342]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:23.684]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:26.545]  It is Friday, December 4th, 2009.
[00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:29.346]  We're gonna be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:43.360]  I want to illustrate today that Climategate is a great victory against the globalists.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.383]  It is the centerpiece to their global government taxation regulation program.
[00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.399]  The
[00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:17.777]  Australian's lives, that was soundly defeated and much of the government has now resigned.
[00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:24.282]  The Parliament is in the final stages of collapsing.
[00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:42.556]  But still in Australia, Canada, England, Europe, the United States, many areas of Latin America, China, they are still implementing at the local level and the regional level, the state level, massive, absolutely massive,
[00:01:46.414 --> 00:01:50.818]  Carbon taxes and environmental taxes that have nothing to do with the environment.
[00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:54.302]  So I want to go over this today.
[00:01:54.302 --> 00:01:58.366]  Also, we're seeing some deceptive job numbers.
[00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:05.673]  They're claiming it's gone from 10.2 down to 10 when all of the private institutions out there even CNBC's own number 17.5.
[00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:08.997]  So when you see headlines like, oh,
[00:02:10.683 --> 00:02:14.487]  Jobless numbers so good it's almost unbelievable because it is unbelievable.
[00:02:14.487 --> 00:02:14.987]  It's a fraud.
[00:02:14.987 --> 00:02:16.128]  It's a lie.
[00:02:16.128 --> 00:02:20.793]  The good news is the people are waking up to the real government, the illegitimate shadow banking government.
[00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:25.497]  Rasmussen polls just 21% favor Bernanke's reappointment as Fed chairman.
[00:02:25.497 --> 00:02:26.818]  He's been massively grilled.
[00:02:26.818 --> 00:02:30.221]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:32.724]  We're going to break it all down today.
[00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:42.343]  And we're also going to open the phones up.
[00:02:42.343 --> 00:02:49.428]  We're gonna open the phones up for the full four hours to talk about any news item, any issue, anything happening in your area.
[00:02:49.428 --> 00:02:58.114]  Climategate, what's happening to the dollar, the expansion of the war by Obama massively.
[00:02:58.114 --> 00:02:59.715]  Here's the toll-free number to join us.
[00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:00.555]  You're going to need it.
[00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:00.915]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:00.975]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.460]  In fact, I'm going to come back after this quick break and just take calls until the bottom of the hour.
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.210]  Then I'm going to do a news blitz on ClimateGate, BankingGate, and so much more.
[00:03:21.058 --> 00:03:26.342]  And cover all the latest developments on Climategate, and then cover how they're still moving forward, though.
[00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:33.949]  Yes, we're having victories, but they're moving forward at the local, state, and regional level, not just in the United States, but across the planet.
[00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:37.752]  The toll-free number to join us again on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:43.476]  I know a lot of people email me and write me letters saying, I've tried to call in for years, I can't ever get in.
[00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:48.861]  What you do is, as soon as you hear a caller hang up, as soon as I let a caller go, start dialing, we're gonna get you on air.
[00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:52.001]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:52.001 --> 00:04:01.646]  Also, there are more mainstream media reports of military checkpoints and warrantless police checkpoints going on all over the country.
[00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:06.329]  We're being eased in to a form of martial law.
[00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.930]  So we also want to get your reports on that.
[00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:19.397]  More and more YouTube videos popping up every few days of different listeners of this show, predominantly, who are driving through their towns all over the country and running into military checkpoints.
[00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:23.049]  With National Guard, Regular Army, Marine Corps.
[00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:27.994]  This is a huge story we've been tracking for 14 years and it's really beginning to come to a head.
[00:04:27.994 --> 00:04:33.819]  The quiet behind the scenes militarization of police and their integration with regular military.
[00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:35.740]  It is all coming up today 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.422]  Ron Paul is going to be on with us next week.
[00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:39.283]  I want to just tell you that.
[00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:47.113]  We're going to have Lord Moncton on for at least one report, perhaps two or three reports.
[00:04:47.113 --> 00:04:52.041]  Jesse Ventura is going to pop back in about his show being the highest rated ever on TruTV.
[00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:52.862]  Big victory there.
[00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.722]  So much is coming up today.
[00:04:57.722 --> 00:04:59.424]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:00.264]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.264 --> 00:05:04.388]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecolablue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:07.271]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:08.532]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:05:08.532 --> 00:05:09.353]  It's very real.
[00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:11.595]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:05:11.595 --> 00:05:13.237]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:05:13.237 --> 00:05:17.721]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecolablue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:19.983]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:33.906]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:05:33.906 --> 00:05:36.626]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:36.626 --> 00:05:43.768]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:05:44.068 --> 00:05:47.813]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:48.053]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:05:48.053 --> 00:05:49.995]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:06:00.046 --> 00:06:04.608]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.608 --> 00:06:05.508]  Number one.
[00:06:05.508 --> 00:06:08.949]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:09.809]  Number two.
[00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:14.691]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:15.431]  It's true.
[00:06:15.431 --> 00:06:19.973]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:21.134]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.134 --> 00:06:24.717]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:28.640]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.421]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:32.183]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:35.866]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.866 --> 00:06:36.667]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:40.810]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.574]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.854 --> 00:06:50.020]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.822]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.822 --> 00:06:54.065]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:56.409]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:06.358]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.
[00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:20.824]  If you suffer from chronic or recurring pain, or if you take prescription drugs for pain, then you owe it to yourself to visit TPR20info.com and get TPR20, the effective pain relief cream, without the harmful side effects of prescription drugs.
[00:07:21.224 --> 00:07:25.308]  I use TPR20 for arthritis in my hand and it works great.
[00:07:25.308 --> 00:07:29.812]  It relieves the pain fast and fights the inflammation to keep the pain away longer.
[00:07:29.812 --> 00:07:38.981]  On TPR20info.com, you can read about the many uses of TPR20, like arthritis, fibromyalgia, sports injuries, back pain, sore muscles, and much, much more.
[00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:41.162]  The tour that we're about to take
[00:08:02.824 --> 00:08:12.753]  ...take is designed to promote awareness of the challenges that we face from climate change and the kind of things that we can do together to overcome those challenges.
[00:08:12.753 --> 00:08:17.697]  In California, we're already seeing the signs of a change in climate.
[00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:30.528]  Average temperatures in our state rose nearly two degrees, and if greenhouse gas emissions are not substantially reduced, scientists tell us that temperatures in California could rise an additional seven degrees during this century.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.804]  Perhaps one of the greatest risks from climate change is a less reliable water supply.
[00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:40.327]  Californians have long struggled with water shortages.
[00:08:40.327 --> 00:08:47.513]  And those shortages are expected to get worse as temperatures rise and as we lose our precious Sierra snowpack.
[00:08:47.513 --> 00:08:56.961]  Projections shown here indicate that if global warming continues unabated, the spring snowpack in the Sierra Nevada will virtually disappear by the end of the century.
[00:08:57.742 --> 00:09:08.654]  This would pose extreme challenges to water managers, hamper hydropower generation and nearly eliminate skiing, snowboarding and other recreational activities.
[00:09:08.654 --> 00:09:15.622]  Now another area of concern for California is our 1,100 miles of scenic coastline.
[00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:18.766]  Our coast, home to over 25 million people,
[00:09:19.306 --> 00:09:26.770]  He's vulnerable to a range of natural hazards, including storms, high tides, and rising sea levels.
[00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:38.037]  By investing in green technology, we can create a new economic foundation for the 21st century that is built on clean fuel, clean energy, and clean cars.
[00:09:38.037 --> 00:09:42.560]  Now one terrific example is, for instance, the car company called Tesla Motors.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.161]  Tesla manufactures cars that are 100% electric.
[00:09:46.823 --> 00:09:49.604]  They produce zero greenhouse gases.
[00:09:49.604 --> 00:09:55.846]  And did I mention, they can go from zero to 60 in 3.9 seconds.
[00:09:55.846 --> 00:10:06.029]  I'm proud that because of California's aggressive environmental policies, Tesla is manufacturing their cars and creating their great jobs right here in California.
[00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:10.790]  In fact, a wave of green innovation is washing over our state.
[00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.972]  We are proving that it is possible to protect both the environment and the economy.
[00:10:25.552 --> 00:10:30.373]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:10:30.373 --> 00:10:31.973]  You want answers?
[00:10:31.973 --> 00:10:33.513]  Well, so does he.
[00:10:33.513 --> 00:10:37.714]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:10:37.714 --> 00:10:45.955]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:10:45.955 --> 00:10:51.796]  It is Friday, the 4th day of December 2009.
[00:10:51.796 --> 00:10:54.757]  Wide open phones, the latest on Climategate.
[00:10:56.323 --> 00:11:00.565]  The battle to remove Private Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
[00:11:00.565 --> 00:11:06.847]  It's all coming up today on our once a week visit with Bob Chapman on the economy.
[00:11:06.847 --> 00:11:14.030]  Now I just played that Schwarzenegger clip and later I'm going to play a bunch of audio and video clips here on air dealing with Climategate.
[00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.312]  But I did just want to start the second segment of the show with that clip because it's all lies.
[00:11:19.887 --> 00:11:23.651]  I have a Daily Mail article here out of Canada.
[00:11:23.651 --> 00:11:31.158]  Arnold Schwarzenegger unveils dramatic climate change map which shows flooded San Francisco of the future.
[00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:35.943]  It shows Alcatraz and Treasure Island being completely underwater.
[00:11:35.943 --> 00:11:38.986]  Water would have to raise over 40 feet for that to happen.
[00:11:40.276 --> 00:11:51.278]  This is the equivalent of telling children that the boogeyman is going to sneak into their rooms at night and chop their heads off if they don't do what their parents tell them.
[00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:54.038]  This is just complete and total fraud.
[00:11:54.038 --> 00:12:09.201]  The official United Nations IPCC fraud, their numbers coming from the East Anglia Weather Center, that was their main group they colluded with, say that sea levels will rise by a foot
[00:12:10.034 --> 00:12:12.635]  In the next three decades, and that's been proven to be a fraud.
[00:12:12.635 --> 00:12:16.617]  Not 30 feet, not 40 feet, like Schwarzenegger saying.
[00:12:16.617 --> 00:12:26.541]  John P. Holdren got grilled a few days ago in Congress, the White House science czar, saying that sea levels would rise 13 to 14 feet.
[00:12:26.541 --> 00:12:31.543]  And the senator pulled out the UN's own report saying one foot.
[00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:33.204]  It's all lies.
[00:12:36.946 --> 00:12:42.270]  And Schwarzenegger talks about clean energy, fun cars, you know, that's the candy coating to make it sound reasonable.
[00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:50.117]  No, this is the government, dictatorially, outside of the legislature, the executive, in California saying, we're banning TVs over 40 inches.
[00:12:50.117 --> 00:12:52.018]  We're putting taxes on all the rest.
[00:12:52.018 --> 00:12:53.099]  They announced that three weeks ago.
[00:12:53.099 --> 00:12:59.124]  Just said, I'm just ordering the energy agency in California to do this.
[00:12:59.124 --> 00:13:04.589]  You see, real profits are in artificial scarcity, in artificial monopolies and cartels.
[00:13:05.706 --> 00:13:12.111]  Schwarzenegger, I was no fan of Governor Gray Davis, and you live, you learn.
[00:13:12.111 --> 00:13:28.843]  And I got fooled, what was it, six years ago, seven years ago, back during that recall, because he was an anti-gun guy, he wanted to ban guns outright, he was a big government pimp, and so I got behind some of the state senators that were trying to recall him.
[00:13:28.843 --> 00:13:30.044]  They then stepped aside
[00:13:32.063 --> 00:13:48.574]  And Schwarzenegger was inserted in, riding on the wave of indignation and anger against the state for charging billions of dollars a week, in some cases, more for energy than what it really costs for electricity.
[00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:52.417]  Now it turned out Gray Davis was actually fighting that.
[00:13:52.417 --> 00:13:53.498]  That's why they did the recall.
[00:13:53.498 --> 00:13:57.538]  Gray Davis was a bad guy, but he was right in blaming Enron.
[00:13:57.538 --> 00:14:11.001]  It later came out Enron, who ran the system through the government, was defrauding people and saying there wasn't enough power, and double, triple, quadruple, and even some cases higher, some cases ten times what electricity was really costing.
[00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:18.942]  They were just claiming that that was the cost because they controlled the mercantile exchange system in California.
[00:14:19.722 --> 00:14:21.465]  And so they just robbed everybody.
[00:14:21.465 --> 00:14:34.102]  And it came out in internal memos that Enron would turn the power off a few minutes or even an hour or longer every day to create the perception that there was no power so people would accept higher prices for power.
[00:14:35.322 --> 00:14:49.170]  Schwarzenegger then ran for governor against Enron and it turned out that he'd been in secret meetings a year before the scam started with Enron head and other energy heads, preparing the whole recall, the entire scam.
[00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.532]  That came out in the news, but just buried in the articles.
[00:14:53.669 --> 00:14:58.813]  And so now the government is just going to run this scam on a wider scale.
[00:14:58.813 --> 00:15:05.358]  Arnold Alos Schwarzenegger is an un-American piece of filth and trash and a degenerate criminal.
[00:15:05.358 --> 00:15:06.979]  Period.
[00:15:06.979 --> 00:15:08.320]  He is worse than Al Gore.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:18.608]  Al Gore is trying to set up the global scam and wants the carbon credits to be paid to him and he's getting a lot of the quote green funding money for startup companies that he owns, runs or controls.
[00:15:19.804 --> 00:15:20.825]  And that's bad.
[00:15:20.825 --> 00:15:32.796]  But Schwarzenegger, in control of the 7th largest economy in the world, by itself it's the 7th largest economy in the world, is literally raping the people.
[00:15:32.796 --> 00:15:42.465]  And to have him sit up there with maps of San Francisco underwater is a fraud of biblical proportions.
[00:15:42.465 --> 00:15:43.386]  It is a lie!
[00:15:44.815 --> 00:15:47.116]  That sea levels are gonna rise a foot.
[00:15:47.116 --> 00:15:48.717]  It is a lie that they're gonna rise two feet.
[00:15:48.717 --> 00:15:52.038]  It's a lie that they're gonna rise five feet, 10 feet, 20 feet, 30 feet.
[00:15:52.038 --> 00:15:53.939]  This guy's saying over 30 feet.
[00:15:53.939 --> 00:15:56.820]  It is a complete and total fraud.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:05.004]  And even if the earth did heat up, and even if sea levels did rise dramatically, that is because of the sun.
[00:16:05.004 --> 00:16:09.646]  But now that warming trend has been reversed for at least the last nine years.
[00:16:10.888 --> 00:16:14.551]  And since 1961, the warming trend stabilized.
[00:16:14.551 --> 00:16:15.793]  It's now dropping.
[00:16:15.793 --> 00:16:20.697]  And we have the internal UN Climate Research Facility documents on this.
[00:16:20.697 --> 00:16:25.381]  So understand, yeah, we're having a big victory with ClimateGate documents and emails coming out.
[00:16:25.381 --> 00:16:30.186]  And yes, Al Gore is canceling a lot of his speaking engagements and trips to Copenhagen.
[00:16:30.186 --> 00:16:32.628]  And yes, they're in retreat on many fronts.
[00:16:32.628 --> 00:16:33.229]  But understand,
[00:16:34.741 --> 00:16:46.204]  There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of climate taxes all over the nation already in place, and we need to start routing them out because they're based on this fraud.
[00:16:46.204 --> 00:16:55.067]  They already put a lot of their criminality in place before we were able to turn this around, and we're just now starting to turn it around, but it's like a battleship.
[00:16:55.067 --> 00:16:59.868]  You may turn the wheel, but it takes a long time to get it to begin really turning.
[00:17:01.417 --> 00:17:06.579]  And it's still basically plowing right into us.
[00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:17.383]  In other ClimateGate news, we're going to detail in more detail later, Climate Investigator is a member of vehemently pro-man-made global warming organization.
[00:17:17.383 --> 00:17:27.347]  So the people they're hiring in England, the people they're hiring in the US, the people they're hiring in Australia to investigate ClimateGate are people intimately involved in it.
[00:17:28.237 --> 00:17:40.700]  Kind of like they called the Waco investigation independent when Janet Reno and the Justice Department that carried out the attack of Waco on April 19, 1993, ran the investigation themselves.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:47.482]  Or Bush appointing the two chairmen of the 9-11 Commission and calling it an independent investigation.
[00:17:47.482 --> 00:17:48.522]  No.
[00:17:48.522 --> 00:17:49.262]  It's not independent.
[00:17:50.891 --> 00:17:52.274]  It's all fraud.
[00:17:52.274 --> 00:17:56.140]  The sea levels aren't going to rise 40 feet, or 11 feet, or 14 feet.
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.643]  Polar bears aren't drowning.
[00:17:57.643 --> 00:18:01.289]  Polar bear numbers aren't down.
[00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.073]  It's a fraud that
[00:18:05.563 --> 00:18:07.964]  The United Nations is going to do an independent investigation.
[00:18:07.964 --> 00:18:10.766]  Or the British government is going to do an independent investigation.
[00:18:10.766 --> 00:18:14.407]  Because they're the governments that want this new system of feudalism.
[00:18:14.407 --> 00:18:16.669]  Of Neo's feudal serfdom.
[00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:17.909]  They are the progenitors.
[00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:19.290]  They are the people that want it.
[00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:23.612]  And so these investigations are frauds and will be frauds.
[00:18:23.612 --> 00:18:28.935]  That's why Senator Boxer over the committee with Inhofe won't allow an investigation by that committee.
[00:18:28.935 --> 00:18:32.376]  She says, I may have an investigation of who stole the emails.
[00:18:32.376 --> 00:18:33.557]  Turning it around backwards.
[00:18:37.017 --> 00:18:40.520]  Now it's clear it's a hoax, that these weren't even hacked emails.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.081]  The police just said that.
[00:18:42.081 --> 00:18:48.987]  It was investigators inside, people that were working inside the university, that leaked it to the BBC and others.
[00:18:48.987 --> 00:18:50.528]  How do we know?
[00:18:50.528 --> 00:18:56.253]  The media's had to admit, well, yes, there were internal people working there that did contact us, but we didn't publish what they gave us.
[00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:09.914]  So then someone just put it on a public server at the university and let people know because there have been FOIA requests that had been blocked criminally by the university heads in collusion with the government.
[00:19:09.914 --> 00:19:11.635]  That's in the emails!
[00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:14.656]  This is the people's data by law!
[00:19:14.656 --> 00:19:19.157]  It was by law is meant to be released but it wasn't.
[00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:20.298]  Alright, I'm already getting into this.
[00:19:20.298 --> 00:19:26.080]  It's just that the plot is thickening and they are now turning on each other.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:37.000]  Professor Piltdown Man, Professor Man in Pennsylvania is now turning against Mr. Jones, the head
[00:19:38.931 --> 00:19:41.593]  Ringleader of the climate scam.
[00:19:41.593 --> 00:19:42.313]  It's all coming up.
[00:19:42.313 --> 00:19:43.814]  But first, your calls.
[00:19:43.814 --> 00:19:44.495]  Straight ahead.

[00:20:20.778 --> 00:20:24.880]  Dear Linda, I would be hard pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.361]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:33.923]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[00:20:33.923 --> 00:20:35.984]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[00:20:35.984 --> 00:20:38.144]  I can't say enough about this book.

[00:20:40.065 --> 00:20:45.787]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.

[00:24:15.115 --> 00:24:17.737]  Who are brainwashing children in public schools and
[00:24:19.482 --> 00:24:32.173]  Preschool, telling them that the penguins are dying and drowning, that there's no ice caps, that are telling people their homes are going to be underwater, that show them cartoons made for children of dogs drowning.
[00:24:32.173 --> 00:24:33.414]  Listen, you criminals!
[00:24:33.414 --> 00:24:35.737]  We're going to route you out worldwide.

[00:24:42.703 --> 00:24:44.885]  Kelly in Idaho, you're on the air.
[00:24:48.564 --> 00:24:49.784]  Yes, Kelly, go ahead.
[00:24:49.784 --> 00:24:52.125]  Oh, sorry, I didn't hear you call my name.
[00:24:52.125 --> 00:24:55.026]  Hey, uh, Alex, it's good talking with you.
[00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:59.848]  Uh, I am chairman of Idaho for the Independent American Party.
[00:24:59.848 --> 00:25:03.929]  Do you mind if I get a website or two out?
[00:25:03.929 --> 00:25:04.270]  Yes, sir.
[00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:16.334]  Uh, USIAP.org, HomelandInsecurity.info, HomelandInsecurity.info, USIAP.org.
[00:25:16.334 --> 00:25:16.794]  Hey, um,
[00:25:17.697 --> 00:25:28.485]  You know, my beginning to all this started with a guy in Austin, Texas by the name of Alex Jones years ago, and I appreciate profusely the stuff you do.
[00:25:28.485 --> 00:25:43.016]  But one thing, you know, studying the Founding Fathers and reading books and doing research myself, I feel strongly that they were advocates of public and private prayer.
[00:25:43.016 --> 00:25:45.778]  And if I do have a message from the Founders for you today,
[00:25:46.474 --> 00:25:47.755]  This is your radio show.
[00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:50.697]  You know, I hear you every so often kind of rant and rave a little bit.
[00:25:50.697 --> 00:25:51.438]  This is your show.
[00:25:51.438 --> 00:26:03.547]  You don't like to be included with all the tangents and all those things, but Alex Jones, I believe, can if he wants to start and end this program every day with prayer.
[00:26:03.547 --> 00:26:04.468]  I believe you can do that.
[00:26:04.468 --> 00:26:06.029]  I believe it'd be good for America.
[00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.410]  Okay.
[00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.431]  I appreciate your call, Kelly.
[00:26:08.431 --> 00:26:10.112]  Let's talk to Jeff in Oregon.
[00:26:10.112 --> 00:26:12.294]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:26:12.294 --> 00:26:12.915]  Yes.
[00:26:12.915 --> 00:26:14.136]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:26:14.136 --> 00:26:14.476]  Hey, buddy.
[00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:19.531]  Hey, I just wanted to tell you and ask you a question on this.
[00:26:19.531 --> 00:26:26.479]  I viewed Michael Rupert's new film, the debut of it, Collapse, in Portland, Oregon last night.
[00:26:26.479 --> 00:26:27.320]  Have you heard of the film?
[00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:37.754]  Yes, it's basically kind of a George Soros view that the Earth's resources are running out, global warming's real.
[00:26:37.754 --> 00:26:40.895]  I know Mike writes articles about how we've got to reduce the population.
[00:26:40.895 --> 00:26:50.020]  And it's basically the establishment's angle of they can't beat the conspiracy theorist, as we're known by the mainstream media, so join them.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.842]  And it's all about how he predicted the banking crisis when
[00:26:53.442 --> 00:27:01.868]  Anybody who could research what was happening, and Ron Paul predicted it 30 years ago, could understand that the Fractional Reserve Banking System was going to do this to us.
[00:27:01.868 --> 00:27:05.590]  And it's basically kind of like an Al Gore type movie.
[00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:12.635]  I haven't seen it, but I've seen the trailer and read the synopsis, and I know that it's made by the same guy that made a movie about the Yes Men.
[00:27:12.635 --> 00:27:16.298]  We know the Yes Men are funded by the Soros crowd.
[00:27:16.298 --> 00:27:19.780]  But, you know, Mike's written a lot of bad things about me and attacked me over the years.
[00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:39.090]  After I stopped having him on the show, when he started getting into all this stuff, I think he's done good research on government drug dealing, the CIA narcotics trafficking, but yeah, I mean, this is what we can expect from folks, so I really don't have anything to say about it.
[00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:45.994]  I'm not going to be seeing it, and I'm not even really going to give it any attention on my show, but you can give us your take on it if you'd like.
[00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:50.872]  Well, my take on it was pretty much how you just broke it down.
[00:27:50.872 --> 00:27:53.334]  I mean, I never heard of Michael Rupert.
[00:27:53.334 --> 00:27:53.955]  He was there.
[00:27:53.955 --> 00:27:56.357]  I met him at the premiere.
[00:27:56.357 --> 00:27:57.598]  Seemed like a nice guy.
[00:27:57.598 --> 00:28:05.004]  And yeah, he did do a lot of great things about exposing drug trafficking in the CIA.
[00:28:05.004 --> 00:28:14.312]  But I got the feeling that his movie was somewhere between Fall of the Republic and Michael Moore's documentary.
[00:28:14.312 --> 00:28:14.853]  In other words,
[00:28:15.573 --> 00:28:26.924]  Yes, he agrees there's going to be a collapse, but I asked him because he had a quick Q&A at the end of the film, and I asked him, you know, it just seems to me, Michael, that there's an elephant in the living room here, and that is
[00:28:27.882 --> 00:28:41.054]  You just delete the fact that there's a coordinated global elite that would not even allow us to have these resources if there were any resources for the shortages that you're suggesting.
[00:28:41.054 --> 00:28:41.574]  Exactly!
[00:28:41.574 --> 00:28:48.581]  The globalists in all their UN documents, Maury Strong, all of them say, we want to shut the resources off.
[00:28:49.696 --> 00:28:53.097]  By design, we're going to tell people there are no resources.
[00:28:53.097 --> 00:29:05.041]  They openly fund the peak oil scam, the global warming scam, all of it, and they know they can't sell it to the public now from the establishment position, so now they come as the grassroots.
[00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:06.422]  Oh, there's a profit!
[00:29:07.182 --> 00:29:08.783]  Letting you in on the inside.
[00:29:08.783 --> 00:29:11.525]  You know, our society is going to collapse.
[00:29:11.525 --> 00:29:26.715]  Yes, because the banks, by design, it's come out in McClatchy newspapers, they got the internal Goldman Sachs documents where they were betting secretly against housing while selling housing and telling people to get involved so they could consolidate power.
[00:29:26.715 --> 00:29:35.521]  They're shutting off our resources and telling us it's because there are no more resources when it's a complete and total fraud.
[00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:36.662]  So I appreciate your call.
[00:29:37.622 --> 00:29:39.163]  It's not going to work.
[00:29:39.163 --> 00:29:39.724]  Okay?
[00:29:39.724 --> 00:29:46.908]  I mean, anytime somebody hears them saying that the sea levels are going to rise by 10 to 40 feet, it's a complete lie.
[00:29:46.908 --> 00:29:51.371]  The UN themselves, with fraudulent numbers, says one foot.
[00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:52.772]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.772 --> 00:29:55.294]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.294 --> 00:29:57.976]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.747 --> 00:30:05.388]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.388 --> 00:30:08.989]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.989 --> 00:30:14.150]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:20.191]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:22.432]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.972 --> 00:30:23.272]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.272 --> 00:30:23.773]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.773 --> 00:30:24.573]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:25.734]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.734 --> 00:30:27.975]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.863 --> 00:30:46.247]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:30:46.247 --> 00:30:49.150]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:58.259]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.971]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.971 --> 00:31:09.293]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:09.293 --> 00:31:11.334]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:11.334 --> 00:31:16.336]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:16.336 --> 00:31:17.517]  How much do you want?
[00:31:17.517 --> 00:31:18.657]  When do you want it?
[00:31:18.657 --> 00:31:20.538]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:20.538 --> 00:31:21.598]  When will you need it?
[00:31:21.598 --> 00:31:23.799]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:25.140]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.681]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:27.721]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:31:27.881 --> 00:31:29.203]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:31:29.203 --> 00:31:31.926]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.926 --> 00:31:35.531]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:35.531 --> 00:31:39.356]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:39.356 --> 00:31:40.577]  How much will you need?
[00:31:40.577 --> 00:31:41.478]  We don't know.
[00:31:41.478 --> 00:31:42.580]  How much do you want?
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.521]  All you can get.
[00:31:43.521 --> 00:31:44.342]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:44.602 --> 00:31:47.644]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:47.644 --> 00:31:49.885]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:49.885 --> 00:31:50.845]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:03.991]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:32:03.991 --> 00:32:06.852]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:32:06.852 --> 00:32:08.132]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:32:08.132 --> 00:32:08.953]  It's very real.
[00:32:08.953 --> 00:32:11.193]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:32:11.193 --> 00:32:12.854]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:32:12.854 --> 00:32:17.155]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:32:47.677 --> 00:32:49.598]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:33:19.022 --> 00:33:28.349]  I only go after kingpins or corrupt police who are persecuting innocent people, CPS that are kidnapping people's children.
[00:33:28.349 --> 00:33:40.077]  I go after the government that is using illegitimate, fraudulently grabbed power outside of due process to abuse people.
[00:33:40.891 --> 00:33:55.486]  And so that's why you haven't really heard me get into reviews of films and books and, you know, materials by little guys who are kind of pushing the establishment agenda, but from our angle.
[00:33:55.486 --> 00:34:00.491]  Because we've got so many big fish to fry here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:02.071 --> 00:34:03.911]  So much is going on and happening.
[00:34:03.911 --> 00:34:22.516]  If I just cover the basics of how the New World Order fraud works, how their scams work, what their eugenics agenda is of cutting off your resources, controlling you, bankrupting you to make you dependent on them, then when you read a book or see a movie or watch a television show, you're going to see the propaganda for yourself.
[00:34:22.516 --> 00:34:31.338]  And then you can make the decision for yourself what you're going to do, what you're going to say, what you're going to promote.
[00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:36.133]  I mean, really, that's the bottom line here.
[00:34:36.133 --> 00:34:45.740]  A few weeks ago, when I watched the trailers for that film and read about it a little bit, I was like, because I'd read previous stuff he'd written, and I was like, man, this is a New World Order agenda, but I just said I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:50.263]  People can figure that out for themselves if they run into it, because I'm not going to spend time promoting it.
[00:34:50.263 --> 00:34:53.806]  I need to spend time talking about the solutions.
[00:34:55.438 --> 00:35:01.780]  And the biggest solution is identifying the global architecture, the system of world government, how they plan on funding it.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.921]  And that is predominantly through fake climate taxes.
[00:35:05.921 --> 00:35:19.226]  Through just the thousands of different things they're going to do, like taxing you for the meat you eat and for products you buy or sell that have a quote high carbon footprint.
[00:35:19.226 --> 00:35:22.547]  And putting tracker boxes in your car to tax you by the mile.
[00:35:23.692 --> 00:35:31.195]  And to control your life so that they can force you to not commute and force you to not have free mobility and track everything you do.
[00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:36.677]  I mean, there's just so many things coming at us.
[00:35:37.984 --> 00:35:39.887]  And that's why I made Follow the Republic.
[00:35:39.887 --> 00:35:41.629]  That's why I made The Obama Deception.
[00:35:41.629 --> 00:35:53.545]  Both of these films cover the climate tax, the climate fraud, the control, how they're not just federalizing but internationalizing all of our counties and cities and states through these international agendas.
[00:35:53.545 --> 00:35:54.806]  The big banks come in.
[00:35:55.856 --> 00:36:00.499]  And tell counties and cities and states, oh, we'll give you this big loan.
[00:36:00.499 --> 00:36:06.143]  We'll give you this bond project, but you've got to agree to follow all these stipulations.
[00:36:06.143 --> 00:36:11.547]  It's exactly what the IMF and World Bank have done for 50 years plus in the third world.
[00:36:11.547 --> 00:36:23.676]  They come in and say, we're going to loan you $5 billion, say in Nigeria, at 30% compounding interest, but you've got to agree to only spend the money with this list of corporations.
[00:36:25.014 --> 00:36:35.140]  Which are the same corporations that are owned by the same private central banks that loan that third world nation taxpayer money at interest.
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.180]  See how the scam works?
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.741]  You know, there's an article today.
[00:36:37.741 --> 00:36:43.264]  Oh, Bank of America pays back the entire 45 billion they got of the TARP funds.
[00:36:43.264 --> 00:36:46.466]  Well, there's several levels to that fraud.
[00:36:46.466 --> 00:36:48.247]  That was only one group.
[00:36:50.399 --> 00:36:54.142]  Of monies that the banks got in that first 700 billion.
[00:36:54.142 --> 00:36:59.586]  It's over 23.7 and that number is four months old.
[00:36:59.586 --> 00:37:06.911]  In the first 10 months of the looting, they stole 23.7 trillion according to Congress and Bloomberg.
[00:37:06.911 --> 00:37:08.091]  Who knows what it is now?
[00:37:08.091 --> 00:37:13.115]  No doubt over 30 trillion at the graph point where it left off.
[00:37:13.115 --> 00:37:15.937]  If you keep following the graph.
[00:37:15.937 --> 00:37:16.297]  But 23.7 trillion.
[00:37:20.384 --> 00:37:22.625]  And they're talking about paying back $45 billion.
[00:37:22.625 --> 00:37:32.831]  What they did is they take the $45 billion, they fractionally reserve it, they loan out 10 times that conservatively, so $45 billion turns into
[00:37:36.243 --> 00:37:37.663]  Half a trillion.
[00:37:37.663 --> 00:37:39.284]  Then they loan that out to subsidiaries.
[00:37:39.284 --> 00:37:41.124]  It gets loaned out again and again and again.
[00:37:41.124 --> 00:37:43.445]  And then with that fiat money, they pay it back.
[00:37:43.445 --> 00:37:47.426]  With digital money, they pay back the original money that they leveraged.
[00:37:47.426 --> 00:37:50.807]  See, when you put one dollar in a bank, they can loan out ten dollars.
[00:37:50.807 --> 00:37:57.308]  But under the Glass-Steagall Act being ended in 1999, they just said, we can have unlimited fractional reserve banking.
[00:37:57.308 --> 00:37:59.969]  We can turn one dollar into a billion dollars.
[00:37:59.969 --> 00:38:03.109]  So no one even knows what they've done.
[00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.830]  We just know it's 1.5
[00:38:05.475 --> 00:38:07.076]  Quadrillion.
[00:38:07.076 --> 00:38:13.922]  In imaginary, made-up currency and credit that the banks made up that they then bought the planet with.
[00:38:13.922 --> 00:38:19.987]  And now, they want to shut your resources off to make you poor, destitute slaves their own white paper state.
[00:38:19.987 --> 00:38:22.849]  This is not my opinion.
[00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:28.794]  And anyone that does any research on it knows we have more oil, more natural gas, more coal,
[00:38:29.701 --> 00:38:31.763]  But the globalists want to shut that off.
[00:38:31.763 --> 00:38:39.671]  They've built the society and the civilization and the infrastructure on those systems.
[00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:43.154]  Our society in the West is laid out for automobiles.
[00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:43.935]  So what do they do?
[00:38:43.935 --> 00:38:54.165]  They take one of the oldest programs out of the playbook of war, siege, and say they're going to totally shut down society.
[00:38:56.155 --> 00:39:06.297]  The Soviets had plenty of resources and their own manuals have been declassified where they would shut off resources on purpose to make people be so destitute they couldn't rise up or stand up.
[00:39:06.297 --> 00:39:16.219]  So you'd be standing in line for 5, 6, 7, 8 hours a day just to get half a loaf of bread and one sausage to go home and feed your family.
[00:39:16.219 --> 00:39:19.019]  Don't you understand that?
[00:39:19.019 --> 00:39:20.980]  This is the system we're going into.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.880]  That's why they want government-run healthcare.
[00:39:24.602 --> 00:39:33.705]  I've got an article today where the Democrats vote in the Senate to block a Republican amendment to not cut Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:39:33.705 --> 00:39:36.906]  Now, what type of upside-down world is that?
[00:39:36.906 --> 00:39:43.228]  Where the Democrats now, see they want to take over with government healthcare and then cut what you get.
[00:39:43.228 --> 00:39:46.609]  They just want the control.
[00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:51.151]  Since when is it the Republicans saying, don't cut people's Medicare and Medicaid?
[00:39:51.151 --> 00:39:52.271]  That's Associated Press.
[00:39:53.581 --> 00:39:55.982]  I'm not even saying the Republicans are good.
[00:39:55.982 --> 00:40:05.426]  If we never would have gotten government control, which we already have to a great extent, of health care, they couldn't be bringing us fully under their control right now.
[00:40:05.426 --> 00:40:11.328]  But what type of backwards world is it where the Republicans don't want people's health care cut?
[00:40:11.328 --> 00:40:12.028]  Heck, where is that?
[00:40:12.028 --> 00:40:22.533]  Is that in my finance section?
[00:40:22.533 --> 00:40:23.173]  No, it's here in my
[00:40:24.992 --> 00:40:35.039]  Senate votes down GOP plan to strip Medicare cuts from bill.
[00:40:52.782 --> 00:41:09.610]  Senate Republicans lost their first major challenge to the Democrat plan to overhaul the healthcare system as the chamber voted Thursday to reject the GOP proposal to strip the package of nearly $500 billion in Medicare cuts, its most important source of financing.
[00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:15.553]  See, Obama can cut your healthcare and be hailed as a loving socialist.
[00:41:15.553 --> 00:41:17.675]  Obama can put 80,000 more troops.
[00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:18.015]  It's not 35.
[00:41:18.015 --> 00:41:21.898]  He already put 40-something in the last 10 months.
[00:41:21.898 --> 00:41:30.844]  He can put in 80,000 more troops and start bombing Pakistan and Code Pink runs out and starts hailing it.
[00:41:30.844 --> 00:41:31.725]  He can cut your...
[00:41:33.649 --> 00:41:36.211]  Medical care, and you love it!
[00:41:36.211 --> 00:41:39.032]  Because it makes you feel like a winner to have him up there.
[00:41:39.032 --> 00:41:41.234]  You feel like, oh, he beat John McCain.
[00:41:41.234 --> 00:41:42.494]  It was all theater.
[00:41:42.494 --> 00:41:50.219]  They boil it down to basically a Coke, Pepsi, Ford, Chevy, Dallas Cowboys versus the Redskins.
[00:41:50.219 --> 00:41:57.103]  They just boil it down to a mindless gruel, and then force feeds you with it.
[00:41:57.103 --> 00:42:01.265]  None of what you hear on the news is real.
[00:42:01.265 --> 00:42:02.066]  It's just all spin.
[00:42:04.704 --> 00:42:08.608]  You know, the big stories you hear about on television every night.
[00:42:08.608 --> 00:42:15.475]  Oh, the truth is in the newspapers, but it's all spun.
[00:42:15.475 --> 00:42:16.636]  It's just all a fraud.
[00:42:16.636 --> 00:42:23.043]  We have a giant criminal government seizing every area of the economy.
[00:42:23.043 --> 00:42:27.667]  Take the auto bailouts of five months ago, six months ago.
[00:42:27.667 --> 00:42:28.148]  On record!
[00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:46.357]  The 50 plus billion dollars injected into the automakers went, with strings attached, so that GM could move to Europe, China, Mexico, and Brazil.
[00:42:46.357 --> 00:42:53.200]  Just Google the headline, one billion of bailout, one billion of auto bailout goes to GM, plant, and Brazil.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.382]  That's just one article I remember from memory.
[00:42:57.382 --> 00:43:02.365]  One billion of automaker bailout goes to GM and Brazil.
[00:43:03.544 --> 00:43:07.745]  And then you can read, oh, three billion to Opel in Germany.
[00:43:07.745 --> 00:43:09.886]  Oh, five billion to China.
[00:43:09.886 --> 00:43:16.307]  They're paying, the government is paying to take your jobs away, fools.
[00:43:16.307 --> 00:43:17.768]  Oh, Obama, I love you.
[00:43:17.768 --> 00:43:19.048]  Bail out the automakers.
[00:43:19.048 --> 00:43:20.688]  Oh, you're so sweet.
[00:43:20.688 --> 00:43:22.729]  They want you to lose your job.
[00:43:22.729 --> 00:43:24.910]  Do you understand?
[00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:26.070]  It's all lies.
[00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.612]  They've got articles today saying it's too good to be true.
[00:43:30.612 --> 00:43:34.334]  Jobless numbers lower from 10.2 to 10.
[00:43:34.334 --> 00:43:36.675]  It's incredible!
[00:43:36.675 --> 00:43:37.456]  And you know what?
[00:43:37.456 --> 00:43:40.157]  There's truth to that article.
[00:43:40.157 --> 00:43:44.179]  It is too good to be true because it's a lie.
[00:43:44.179 --> 00:43:46.881]  Real unemployment's at 22% by every major index.
[00:43:46.881 --> 00:43:48.802]  We'll talk about that in an hour and a half with Bob Chapman.
[00:43:48.802 --> 00:43:54.886]  22% unemployment and they're telling you, oh, it went down to 10.
[00:43:54.886 --> 00:43:56.847]  Just all lies.
[00:44:00.051 --> 00:44:04.094]  Your tax money went to move GM offshore!
[00:44:04.094 --> 00:44:07.156]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up and take calls.
[00:44:07.156 --> 00:44:13.101]  I just... I'm just so sick of watching these criminals loot us.
[00:44:13.101 --> 00:44:15.763]  The big banks want a monopoly.
[00:44:15.763 --> 00:44:18.284]  They use government to create one.
[00:44:18.284 --> 00:44:22.508]  They've got to first ruin the economy to be able to consolidate it.
[00:44:22.508 --> 00:44:22.868]  Got it?
[00:44:24.011 --> 00:44:36.003]  They've got 1.5 quadrillion in cash they made up that they pulled out of a magic hat, out of their top hat, like a magician pulls a rabbit out with red eyes.
[00:44:36.003 --> 00:44:44.612]  While you were watching the beautiful assistant, while you were watching the NFL and drinking beer, you didn't watch what the bankers did.
[00:44:44.612 --> 00:44:46.694]  They were distracting you with the beautiful assistant.
[00:44:49.209 --> 00:44:54.013]  With the porn and the partying and the liquor while you were being sold down the river.
[00:44:54.013 --> 00:44:55.835]  Why do you think these big banks are in power?
[00:44:55.835 --> 00:44:59.799]  Because they're ruthless, they're cunning, they're intelligent.
[00:44:59.799 --> 00:45:06.444]  So of course they're going to come out with fake grassroots movies teaching you why you're about to lose everything you've got.
[00:45:07.236 --> 00:45:09.058]  And then blaming it on the very bankers.
[00:45:09.058 --> 00:45:15.064]  You know, George Soros always goes up before Congress in the last year and talks bad about the bankers and how he's fighting them.
[00:45:15.064 --> 00:45:15.945]  Give me a break!
[00:45:15.945 --> 00:45:20.189]  He was one of the main financiers of Obama running the whole scam.
[00:45:20.189 --> 00:45:21.450]  But the parlor trick works!
[00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:25.835]  I see Democrat sites going, oh look, George Soros is fighting the bankers, isn't that sweet?
[00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:37.119]  We're being physically conquered by the paramilitary police and military.
[00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:40.080]  We're being economically conquered by the banks.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.722]  And now they're going to shut your resources off.
[00:45:42.722 --> 00:45:46.724]  I cannot make it any clearer.
[00:45:46.724 --> 00:45:49.966]  I cannot make it any more straightforward.
[00:45:49.966 --> 00:45:51.987]  Period.
[00:45:51.987 --> 00:45:56.809]  And I cannot stress enough to all of you that the time for screwing around is over.
[00:45:56.809 --> 00:45:57.470]  Everyone
[00:45:58.911 --> 00:46:11.884]  Listening to me must get the DVD Fall of the Republic and the Obama Deception, the most effective films I've made that are about what's happening now and how it's by design from their own documents, their own words.
[00:46:11.884 --> 00:46:14.286]  You must show it to your neighbors this weekend.
[00:46:14.286 --> 00:46:16.108]  You must show it to your school next week.
[00:46:16.108 --> 00:46:17.709]  You must show it to your professor.
[00:46:17.709 --> 00:46:20.312]  You must put it on your local AXS TV.
[00:46:20.312 --> 00:46:22.294]  You must give it to your local talk show host.
[00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:26.812]  InfoWars.com.
[00:46:26.812 --> 00:46:31.077]  You can get a free Obama Joker t-shirt for a limited time.
[00:46:31.077 --> 00:46:32.419]  They're running out fast.
[00:46:32.419 --> 00:46:36.484]  You'll notice some of the sizes and some of the designs are gone at InfoWars.com.
[00:46:39.669 --> 00:46:46.114]  Or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:46:46.114 --> 00:46:46.915]  888-253-3139.
[00:46:46.915 --> 00:46:48.816]  But this isn't pearls before swine.
[00:46:48.816 --> 00:46:50.997]  Sure, I need your financial support.
[00:46:50.997 --> 00:46:53.659]  But all I care about is defeating these people at the end of the day.
[00:46:53.659 --> 00:46:55.301]  That's what makes me get up in the morning.
[00:46:55.301 --> 00:47:07.129]  That my children not grow up as slaves in a literal nightmare 21st century version of the Soviet Union.
[00:47:07.129 --> 00:47:08.250]  Run by a bunch of crooks.
[00:47:10.819 --> 00:47:16.203]  And so that's why I tell you, just Google the term, follow the Republic.
[00:47:16.203 --> 00:47:22.127]  The first link that pops up is the Change the Channel version.
[00:47:22.127 --> 00:47:24.548]  It's not as good as the DVD, but it looks pretty darn good.
[00:47:24.548 --> 00:47:28.191]  You get that, you give it to your whole email list, you spread it out everywhere.
[00:47:28.191 --> 00:47:33.454]  I make a $200,000 film and give it to you for free because I want it to be seen.
[00:47:33.454 --> 00:47:34.675]  I want to beat these people.
[00:47:40.987 --> 00:47:43.529]  Don't sit there thinking you don't have power.
[00:47:43.529 --> 00:47:47.671]  This film exposes Climategate even before Climategate came out.
[00:47:47.671 --> 00:47:49.012]  Everybody's ready to see this.
[00:47:49.012 --> 00:47:50.793]  So you want to understand Climategate?
[00:47:50.793 --> 00:47:51.653]  Watch this.
[00:47:51.653 --> 00:47:53.534]  You want to understand the whole ballgame?
[00:47:53.534 --> 00:47:55.656]  Watch this DVD.
[00:47:55.656 --> 00:47:58.317]  Give it to people this Christmas.
[00:47:58.317 --> 00:48:02.560]  Don't give them a bottle of wild turkey or a bottle of vodka.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.601]  Don't give them a tie or a fruitcake.
[00:48:06.857 --> 00:48:11.421]  Give them Fall of the Republic and the Obama Deception, or Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:12.202]  That's a great film to see.
[00:48:12.202 --> 00:48:13.943]  You want to understand Climategate?
[00:48:13.943 --> 00:48:15.244]  Watch this.
[00:48:15.244 --> 00:48:17.606]  Big Brother doesn't want you to see this.
[00:48:17.606 --> 00:48:20.249]  Or, send it to your whole email list.
[00:48:20.249 --> 00:48:23.511]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv, download high quality versions of it.
[00:48:23.511 --> 00:48:26.334]  Alright.
[00:48:26.334 --> 00:48:30.317]  Until Christmas, we've got 5 plus months free for people that sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:48:34.053 --> 00:48:42.721]  We're going to be posting for PrisonPlanet.tv members next week an hour-long Megadeth special, our behind-the-scenes interview, and so much more.
[00:48:42.721 --> 00:48:45.123]  Believe me, folks are going to want to see this at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:48:45.123 --> 00:48:48.866]  All right, I'm going to shut up and go to your calls here.
[00:48:48.866 --> 00:48:50.248]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air.
[00:48:50.248 --> 00:48:54.111]  Hey Alex, how are you, man?
[00:48:54.111 --> 00:48:55.612]  You know, it's the best of times.
[00:48:55.612 --> 00:48:56.293]  Yes, I hear you.
[00:48:56.293 --> 00:48:57.194]  That's how I was doing.
[00:48:57.194 --> 00:48:59.356]  It is the best of times and it was the worst of times.
[00:49:00.302 --> 00:49:01.042]  I hear ya.
[00:49:01.042 --> 00:49:01.963]  Hey, I got a couple points.
[00:49:01.963 --> 00:49:04.764]  I don't know if you've touched on these, but you might have.
[00:49:04.764 --> 00:49:05.925]  I haven't caught every show.
[00:49:05.925 --> 00:49:12.188]  So, I saw a couple weeks ago an announcement of a ship made out of the steel of the Twin Towers.
[00:49:12.188 --> 00:49:15.590]  And I know a lot of people wanted to get there, you know, for a reinvestigation.
[00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:20.533]  That was going to be an important part of the problem, to get the residue off the steel and everything.
[00:49:20.533 --> 00:49:21.613]  What do you think about that?
[00:49:21.613 --> 00:49:26.996]  And the other question I have is that I heard some propaganda, or it might be not propaganda, of Iran.
[00:49:27.535 --> 00:49:32.198]  Yes, they did build a giant missile cruiser, I forget its name out of the steel, but the USS New York.
[00:49:32.198 --> 00:49:35.040]  But you can't, you can't get residue out of steel that's been re-smelted.
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:50:03.123]  But from different community centers and others that got pieces of the steel that was given to them by the government, folks were able to get the residue from those and find the thermite, the explosive thermate, in it.
[00:50:03.123 --> 00:50:08.624]  On the subject of Iran, Iran gave in to the UN even more than any other country.
[00:50:08.624 --> 00:50:13.605]  Totally peaceful reactors, can't produce anything near the fissile material they need.
[00:50:13.605 --> 00:50:18.686]  And yes, Iran has said, look, we're building our own energy reactors, period.
[00:50:19.486 --> 00:50:23.029]  And so the West is saying, well, we're going to blow the daylights out of you.
[00:50:23.029 --> 00:50:30.154]  And they've had hoaxes where they say, oh my gosh, we found a secret Iranian facility.
[00:50:30.154 --> 00:50:36.419]  Yes, a week after Iran put out a press release saying, yeah, in six months to a year, we'll open this new plant.
[00:50:36.419 --> 00:50:38.760]  You can come inspect it now.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:44.825]  And Iran goes, why should we even let you in here if you run around making up hoaxes that we're hiding facilities?
[00:50:45.771 --> 00:50:50.235]  So, I mean, again, this is a government and a media that tells you polar bears can't swim.
[00:50:50.235 --> 00:50:58.683]  This is a government and a media that told you he got yellowcake uranium in Iraq from Africa and that they had missiles that could blow up the U.S.
[00:50:58.683 --> 00:50:59.444]  in 45 minutes.
[00:50:59.444 --> 00:51:00.405]  Just, it's all lies!
[00:51:00.936 --> 00:51:04.479]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:51:04.479 --> 00:51:06.780]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:07.641]  Don't!
[00:51:07.641 --> 00:51:11.083]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:51:11.083 --> 00:51:11.884]  Why pay?
[00:51:11.884 --> 00:51:18.208]  When you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:51:18.188 --> 00:51:20.170]  's number one debt secret.
[00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:24.253]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:51:24.253 --> 00:51:26.955]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:34.760]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.941]  Herb K. was right.
[00:51:35.941 --> 00:51:39.123]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:51:39.123 --> 00:51:40.484]  What have you got to lose?
[00:51:40.484 --> 00:51:44.186]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:51:44.186 --> 00:51:44.907]  Get Herb K.'
[00:51:44.847 --> 00:51:48.129]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.

[00:51:53.053 --> 00:51:55.915]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:55.915 --> 00:51:58.478]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:58.478 --> 00:52:02.321]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.508 --> 00:52:14.189]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.189 --> 00:52:20.570]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:26.112]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.112 --> 00:52:35.754]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.874 --> 00:52:38.215]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.215 --> 00:52:39.795]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.795 --> 00:52:42.256]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.256 --> 00:52:44.377]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.377 --> 00:52:49.538]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:54:08.859 --> 00:54:09.259]  Welcome.
[00:54:09.259 --> 00:54:10.260]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.020]  Yes, sir.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:12.481]  Okay, your tip line is full.
[00:54:30.225 --> 00:54:36.448]  And I've been trying to get to you for about a week, but I have a thousand foot antenna on my shortwave radio and you're only coming in about 50%.
[00:54:36.448 --> 00:54:37.489]  But here's a tip.
[00:54:37.489 --> 00:54:42.292]  Me and my wife were at a truck stop here at the corner of 31 and 30 in Indiana.
[00:54:42.292 --> 00:54:50.116]  And you all know the Hummers are made in South Bend, Indiana, but there was a, uh, a, um, convoy of them, about three or four semis there.
[00:54:50.116 --> 00:54:54.958]  And, uh, they had, uh, flax in the cars, you know, explosives and all that's coming out on the semis.
[00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:58.000]  And on one semis it says, we support law enforcement.
[00:54:58.533 --> 00:54:58.853]  Thank you, sir.
[00:54:58.853 --> 00:54:59.474]  I appreciate the call.
[00:54:59.474 --> 00:55:01.015]  Let's talk to Dave in Denver.
[00:55:01.015 --> 00:55:01.895]  Dave, you're on the air.
[00:55:27.421 --> 00:55:36.305]  Hey Alex, there's a new book out, Architects of Ruin, how big government liberals wrecked the global economy and how they'll do it again if no one stops them.
[00:55:36.305 --> 00:55:40.466]  It's by Peter Schweizer and it's at Barnes and Nobel.
[00:55:40.466 --> 00:55:54.232]  Starting in the 1960s, left-wing radicals, Barack Obama, Rahm Emanuel, Jesse Jackson, Barney Frank, Robert Rubin, Andrew Cuomo, Chris Dodd, Janet Reno, David Patrick, Deval Patrick,
[00:55:54.758 --> 00:56:13.126]  Henry Cisneros, Nancy Pelosi, Ted Kennedy, Charles Schumer, Hillbillery Clinton, and Saul Alensky and many others aggressively pushed banks to make trillions of dollars in subprime liar loans to individuals who should never have received them in the name of social justice.
[00:56:13.126 --> 00:56:22.810]  Meanwhile, Clinton forged a new form of state capitalism in which the big Wall Street financial companies were repeatedly bailed out with their profits intact.
[00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:31.571]  Well Dave, number one, do me a big favor and turn your radio off.
[00:56:31.571 --> 00:56:35.174]  Because I really, really do want to be able to hear what you're having to say and it becomes a distraction.
[00:56:35.174 --> 00:56:46.261]  Number two, I'm familiar with that book, I've seen the media promoting it, but that's only one wing on this bird of prey when they call it a leftist plan, and whereas it's true that Bill Clinton
[00:56:47.386 --> 00:57:06.394]  Got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act along with the Republicans, and whereas it is true the Democrats pushed to give the subprime mortgage loans to poor people that had no way of paying it back at loan-sharking, you know, rates later, the Republicans were predominantly involved as well.
[00:57:06.394 --> 00:57:11.396]  And so, and you noticed you were reading the back of the book, it was, you know, the mistakes the liberals made.
[00:57:11.396 --> 00:57:12.997]  They didn't make mistakes.
[00:57:12.997 --> 00:57:15.478]  They're not liberals, they're not conservatives, they're big banks.
[00:57:16.218 --> 00:57:22.565]  Who create all this money out of nothing and then tie it to the national debt to literally enslave us.
[00:57:22.565 --> 00:57:24.668]  That's how the banks get the real power.
[00:57:24.668 --> 00:57:27.291]  They don't want you to pay off the loan on the farm.
[00:57:27.291 --> 00:57:29.353]  They want the farm.
[00:57:29.353 --> 00:57:33.317]  It's something very simple that farmers knew a hundred years ago in this country.
[00:57:33.317 --> 00:57:35.900]  But, I mean, Reagan
[00:57:36.821 --> 00:57:36.921]  Yeah.
[00:58:05.043 --> 00:58:18.090]  I don't have my radio on, that's bleed over onto my phone line, maybe from a tap or something, but, uh... Just one other thing, uh, they took one seven-ton beam of that, uh, from the towers there and put it on that ship.
[00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:23.213]  I mean, that's like one little, uh, panel on it, uh, plate on it, but, uh, that's all they used.
[00:58:24.531 --> 00:58:25.192]  Interesting.
[00:58:25.192 --> 00:58:25.932]  Thank you, sir.
[00:58:25.932 --> 00:58:29.495]  I remember reading the article about the USS New York.
[00:58:29.495 --> 00:58:33.237]  We'll be right back with the second, third, and fourth hour.
[00:58:33.237 --> 00:58:35.999]  Bob Chapman in one hour on the economy.
[00:58:35.999 --> 00:58:37.600]  It is Friday, December 4th, 2009.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:45.666]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:00:11.791 --> 01:00:13.353]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.353 --> 01:00:17.538]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.538 --> 01:00:19.882]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.766 --> 01:00:22.568]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.568 --> 01:00:27.874]  We are now into our number two of this Friday edition.
[01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:31.498]  We have wide open telephones at 1-800-259-9231, continuing with your phone calls.
[01:00:35.842 --> 01:00:54.143]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to simulcast the last two and a half hours of this radio show via the video cams at PrisonPlanet.tv so I can play all these different ClimateGate videos, including Schwarzenegger attempting to rescue collapsing global warming fraud with alarmist PR stunt.
[01:00:55.004 --> 01:01:07.289]  Arnie invokes Holdren's absurd alarmism about sea levels in desperate effort to prop up crumbling edifice of climate change scam, saying San Francisco will be underwater.
[01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:08.709]  Just absolute fraud.
[01:01:08.709 --> 01:01:11.670]  We're going to break that down from the UN's own documents.
[01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:14.832]  Even their fraud only says one foot, not 14, not 20, not 30.
[01:01:17.698 --> 01:01:18.138]  Alex.
[01:01:18.138 --> 01:01:18.479]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:18.479 --> 01:01:19.279]  I conducted an exit poll
[01:01:46.667 --> 01:01:58.696]  for our city of Clarks, Georgia this week and the state and the county sent out some officials to mess me up and try to close me down called the Clarkston Cops.
[01:01:58.696 --> 01:02:01.918]  Clarkston Cops came out and supported me.
[01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:03.980]  Okay, so you tried to do an exit poll of what?
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:09.924]  Somebody tried to violate your First Amendment and the police acted as peace officers and guardians of the Republic?
[01:02:09.924 --> 01:02:11.045]  Yes.
[01:02:11.045 --> 01:02:12.986]  Well, tell us what happened.
[01:02:12.986 --> 01:02:13.927]  Well, the exit poll
[01:02:15.622 --> 01:02:23.667]  It's a paper ballot poll done outside of the election precinct, the official election precinct.
[01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:29.071]  They sent out a goon and I spotted exactly what he was trying to do.
[01:02:29.071 --> 01:02:39.638]  He tried to intimidate me to move 150 feet away to the location of where the campaigners for the elections and the candidates have to be.
[01:02:40.478 --> 01:02:44.620]  But the law says, in Georgia at least, that I have to be 25 feet away.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.041]  I was actually 80 feet away.
[01:02:46.041 --> 01:02:48.602]  And he tried to intimidate me.
[01:02:48.602 --> 01:02:56.165]  And I told him he was a liar, or that he was lying, and that he should go home and go to bed.
[01:02:56.165 --> 01:03:03.829]  Then he proceeded to call the cops, and when the Clarkson police came out, he tried to intimidate the police officer.
[01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:05.570]  But the police officer just did his job.
[01:03:07.621 --> 01:03:14.728]  And figured that it was a civil matter, and he didn't understand, and he said, as long as I remain orderly, I can conduct the poll.
[01:03:14.728 --> 01:03:30.342]  And the significance of this for Georgia is that the people fighting to bring paper ballot back and get rid of the de-balled machines need an incident such as this to support them in the Georgia Supreme Court.
[01:03:31.513 --> 01:03:33.034]  Well let me just expand on something.
[01:03:33.034 --> 01:03:45.805]  We've seen the countless videos of union goons beating up Tea Party folks all over the country and then the media spins it and claims Tea Party people are doing it when it's actually the opposite over and over again.
[01:03:45.805 --> 01:03:47.247]  It's the anti-Tea Party people.
[01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:48.147]  I think?
[01:04:07.435 --> 01:04:21.071]  In the excellent illustrative case of the 50-plus billion for the auto bailout, most of it's spent to move the factories to Brazil, to Europe, and to China, and to Mexico.
[01:04:21.071 --> 01:04:22.612]  And that's on record!
[01:04:22.612 --> 01:04:27.438]  I mean, people ought to go to these moron union people and have articles printed up and go,
[01:04:28.519 --> 01:04:32.002]  Okay, I'm trying to keep our jobs here, you fools!
[01:04:32.002 --> 01:04:35.024]  But they don't like you coming to congressional events.
[01:04:35.024 --> 01:04:39.147]  They use union goons to try to stop you.
[01:04:39.147 --> 01:04:40.848]  And you handled him right.
[01:04:40.848 --> 01:04:43.130]  Not getting in his face, but being in charge.
[01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:44.451]  Like you're talking to a dog.
[01:04:44.451 --> 01:04:44.831]  Ha!
[01:04:44.831 --> 01:04:45.352]  Sit!
[01:04:45.352 --> 01:04:45.832]  No!
[01:04:45.832 --> 01:04:46.533]  I have my rights!
[01:04:46.533 --> 01:04:47.773]  You better watch yourself!
[01:04:47.773 --> 01:04:50.576]  Better not tell me to back off, buddy!
[01:04:50.576 --> 01:04:54.519]  I'm the one in charge here under the First Amendment, not you!
[01:04:54.519 --> 01:04:55.679]  You understand me?
[01:04:55.679 --> 01:04:56.300]  Good!
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.321]  Now back off right now!
[01:04:58.168 --> 01:04:58.688]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:15.563 --> 01:05:23.985]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:06:00.441 --> 01:06:03.822]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?

[01:06:07.443 --> 01:06:12.025]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:12.025 --> 01:06:17.627]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:22.692]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.692 --> 01:06:26.315]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:31.120]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:37.687]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:06:37.687 --> 01:06:39.649]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:43.311]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.

[01:07:01.087 --> 01:07:04.089]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:04.089 --> 01:07:09.431]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:11.472]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:11.472 --> 01:07:16.475]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:16.475 --> 01:07:17.656]  How much do you want?
[01:07:17.656 --> 01:07:18.776]  When do you want it?
[01:07:18.776 --> 01:07:20.657]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:07:20.657 --> 01:07:21.738]  When will you need it?
[01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:23.939]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:25.280]  Will there be any food?
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.800]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.861]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:07:28.021 --> 01:07:29.342]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:07:29.342 --> 01:07:32.065]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:07:32.065 --> 01:07:35.649]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:07:35.649 --> 01:07:39.473]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:40.715]  How much will you need?
[01:07:40.715 --> 01:07:41.616]  We don't know.
[01:07:41.616 --> 01:07:42.717]  How much do you want?
[01:07:42.717 --> 01:07:43.458]  All you can get.
[01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:44.459]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:44.719 --> 01:07:47.780]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.881]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:49.881 --> 01:07:55.323]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:55.323 --> 01:07:58.123]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:58.123 --> 01:08:08.927]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.927 --> 01:08:11.908]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:25.779]  Wide open phones today, every Friday, Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster joins us to break down the economy, what happened during the week, and a look at the week coming up ahead.
[01:08:25.779 --> 01:08:30.583]  He'll be joining us next hour with open phones for your financial questions.
[01:08:30.583 --> 01:08:37.008]  Headline up at PrisonPlanet.com, leading the fight against the fraudsters at ClimateGate.
[01:08:37.008 --> 01:08:42.672]  Schwarzenegger attempts to rescue collapsing global warming fraud with alarmist PR stunt.
[01:08:44.085 --> 01:08:53.149]  Arnie invokes the White House science czar's absurd alarmism about sea levels in desperate effort to prop up crumbling edifice of climate change scam.
[01:08:53.149 --> 01:09:01.073]  We're going to play all these videos, including Holdren being grilled in Congress, coming up at the bottom of the hour in T-minus 23 minutes.
[01:09:01.073 --> 01:09:03.434]  So you'll definitely want to stay with us for that.
[01:09:03.434 --> 01:09:05.895]  We come out of break at 33 after.
[01:09:05.895 --> 01:09:10.137]  I'm going to go back to your calls in a moment, but I wanted to play a few minutes from Jon Stewart.
[01:09:10.777 --> 01:09:14.921]  A few days ago when even Jon Stewart wants to keep some of his credibility.
[01:09:14.921 --> 01:09:19.425]  He's been promoting man-made global warming and global taxes and New World Order.
[01:09:19.425 --> 01:09:26.092]  He even had to admit that this looks super bad with these internal emails getting leaked now two weeks ago.
[01:09:26.092 --> 01:09:27.253]  So here's a few minutes of that.
[01:09:27.253 --> 01:09:32.137]  The full video is linked up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and an article written by
[01:09:33.263 --> 01:09:37.787]  Aaron Dykes titled, It's Over Al Gore.
[01:09:37.787 --> 01:09:40.130]  It has that video posted in it if you want to see it.
[01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:45.755]  Here it is.
[01:09:45.755 --> 01:09:57.366]  A hacker in England got hold of emails between leading scientists which skeptics say show a clear effort to raise fears about global warming and hide evidence against it.
[01:09:57.366 --> 01:09:58.207]  Oh for f**k's sake.
[01:10:04.127 --> 01:10:06.849]  Poor Al Gore!
[01:10:06.849 --> 01:10:12.211]  Global warming completely debunked via the very internet you invented.
[01:10:12.211 --> 01:10:12.632]  Oh!
[01:10:12.632 --> 01:10:14.213]  Oh, the irony!
[01:10:14.213 --> 01:10:15.313]  The irony!
[01:10:20.177 --> 01:10:22.238]  Actually, the real story is not quite that sensational.
[01:10:22.238 --> 01:10:30.081]  Basically, emails stolen from scientists at one of the leading study centers for global warming show them discussing their work a bit... How do I put this?
[01:10:30.081 --> 01:10:31.622]  Casually.
[01:10:31.622 --> 01:10:38.625]  He wrote, The fact is, we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can't.
[01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:44.508]  I've just completed Mike's nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years, i.e.
[01:10:44.508 --> 01:10:45.648]  from 1981 onwards, and from 1961 for Keith's
[01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:51.030]  It's nothing!
[01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:59.273]  He was just using a trick to hide the decline!
[01:10:59.273 --> 01:11:12.578]  It's just scientist speak for using a standard statistical technique recalibrating data in order to trick you into not knowing about the decline.
[01:11:12.578 --> 01:11:13.758]  But here's what's great about science.
[01:11:13.758 --> 01:11:16.879]  In disagreement, we go back and look at the raw data.
[01:11:17.682 --> 01:11:22.006]  University scientists say raw data from the 1980s was thrown out.
[01:11:22.006 --> 01:11:25.028]  Oh, for f**k's sake!
[01:11:25.028 --> 01:11:27.771]  Why would you throw out raw data from the 80s?
[01:11:27.771 --> 01:11:34.336]  I still have penthouses from the 70s!
[01:11:34.336 --> 01:11:37.119]  Laminated!
[01:11:37.119 --> 01:11:38.980]  What did you keep?
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.803]  The scientists say they kept something called value-added data.
[01:11:45.129 --> 01:11:46.690]  Value-added data?
[01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:47.191]  What is that?
[01:11:47.191 --> 01:11:50.894]  Numbers fortified with art?
[01:11:50.894 --> 01:11:52.275]  Truth Plus?
[01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:53.416]  Now with lemon?
[01:11:53.416 --> 01:11:56.278]  It doesn't look good.
[01:11:56.278 --> 01:11:58.219]  Now does it disprove global warming?
[01:11:58.219 --> 01:11:59.961]  No, of course not!
[01:11:59.961 --> 01:12:05.385]  But it does put a fresh set of energizers in the Senate's resident denier bunny.
[01:12:05.385 --> 01:12:12.891]  The fact that this whole idea on the global warming, I'm glad that's over, gone, done, we won, you lost, get a life.
[01:12:16.107 --> 01:12:17.648]  We knew Inhofe was going to say that.
[01:12:17.648 --> 01:12:23.293]  I mean, that guy thinks global warming is debunked every time he drinks a slushy and gets a brain freeze.
[01:12:23.293 --> 01:12:26.876]  Alright, so he's trying to be in the middle of the road there.
[01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:30.339]  He says, does this mean global warming is debunked?
[01:12:30.339 --> 01:12:31.240]  Of course not.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.261]  Well, actually it does.
[01:12:32.261 --> 01:12:39.427]  This is the head climate research facility of the United Nations that they chose
[01:12:40.461 --> 01:12:42.303]  to publish the data.
[01:12:42.303 --> 01:12:44.324]  They produce the fraudulent data.
[01:12:44.324 --> 01:12:48.288]  This is the head organization that gives Goddard Space Center in the U.S.
[01:12:48.288 --> 01:12:49.409]  its data, that gives the U.N.
[01:12:49.409 --> 01:12:50.190]  its data.
[01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:55.534]  This is the kingpins, and in these thousands of emails and internal documents they're in conversations
[01:12:56.215 --> 01:13:00.996]  With the top fraudulent professors at the other two big universities used by the UN.
[01:13:00.996 --> 01:13:20.520]  Three universities are used, all three are in the emails, colluding to engage in fraud on record, but even worse, to persecute other scientists, to keep their papers from being published in prestigious peer-reviewed journals, to block journals from publishing them, to get people's funding cut.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.600]  That's where the real civil lawsuits are.
[01:13:23.427 --> 01:13:33.356]  These professors caught talking about how they're persecuting people and how they're communicating with governments and funding institutions to persecute scientists that are exposing them as frauds.
[01:13:33.356 --> 01:13:34.938]  That is racketeering.
[01:13:34.938 --> 01:13:40.503]  That is an attempt to chill free speech and to shut down people's careers and to lie about them.
[01:13:40.503 --> 01:13:41.724]  But then it gets worse.
[01:13:41.724 --> 01:13:47.149]  The computer program got leaked that they used to crunch the climate data, that value-added data.
[01:13:48.755 --> 01:13:50.596]  And what happens in there?
[01:13:50.596 --> 01:13:57.521]  There are notes from the computer programmer how to carry out the fraud and cook the books to hide the decline.
[01:13:57.521 --> 01:14:03.004]  The whole thing is a blueprint, a roadmap, a manual on fraud.
[01:14:03.004 --> 01:14:04.825]  And it gets even worse from there.
[01:14:04.825 --> 01:14:06.626]  Then the emails.
[01:14:06.626 --> 01:14:07.947]  You can go read these online.
[01:14:07.947 --> 01:14:10.209]  Mainstream media's been reporting on them now for almost two weeks.
[01:14:11.343 --> 01:14:17.327]  We have hundreds of the emails posted on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with links to the full files.
[01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:21.789]  Worst stuff comes out every day as people read through them.
[01:14:21.789 --> 01:14:28.033]  Not only do they hide the decline and say, oh, it's horrible, the Earth's getting colder, how do we cover this up, how do we persecute scientists.
[01:14:29.235 --> 01:14:30.116]  No!
[01:14:30.116 --> 01:14:41.566]  They're then in there talking to the US and British governments about how to block the release of university data that taxpayers paid for through grants, going, oh yes, I talked to the head of the group.
[01:14:41.566 --> 01:14:44.189]  They're going to block it from the public because this is too damning.
[01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:45.570]  Yes, I'm working with them to block it.
[01:14:45.570 --> 01:14:47.091]  They're not going to release it.
[01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:50.775]  So they're also caught working with the government in a criminal conspiracy
[01:14:52.281 --> 01:14:53.443]  To cover all of this up.
[01:14:53.443 --> 01:14:56.308]  Hundreds of the emails deal with that.
[01:14:56.308 --> 01:14:57.710]  Alright, I said I'm going to your calls.
[01:14:57.710 --> 01:15:06.045]  Coming up in about 15 minutes we're going to start going into these videos and Schwarzenegger attempts to rescue collapsing global warming fraud with alarmist PR stunt.
[01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:16.705]  Two weeks ago, when these documents first came out, I said this was the equivalent of the Death Star plans being stolen, but that we had to get this information out and force it into the mainstream media.
[01:15:16.705 --> 01:15:29.748]  Now people are resigning, the Australian government just voted down carbon taxes, Al Gore's cancelling speaking engagements and speaking in Copenhagen, Denmark, because he knows people are going to be there shouting him down and protesting him.
[01:15:29.748 --> 01:15:35.729]  Their entire program is in retreat, so Schwarzenegger comes out with a press conference and says, San Francisco will be underwater!
[01:15:37.045 --> 01:15:45.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are parts of San Francisco, the hills of San Francisco, 600 feet above sea level.
[01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:46.990]  In fact, we've got to have an article here.
[01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:51.613]  The LA Times has done a report on this, and so has the Mail.
[01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:55.035]  But we need to, in fact, pull up San Francisco's sea levels for me.
[01:15:56.149 --> 01:16:01.912]  I only happen to know the sea levels because I pulled them up this morning and it was listing different hills in San Francisco.
[01:16:01.912 --> 01:16:04.273]  One was 600 and something feet above sea level.
[01:16:04.273 --> 01:16:05.273]  That's a big hill.
[01:16:05.273 --> 01:16:09.095]  A mountain's 300 feet above, 3,000 feet above sea level.
[01:16:09.095 --> 01:16:10.376]  A big hill is 600 feet.
[01:16:10.376 --> 01:16:14.318]  I mean, the water's going to rise 600 feet, huh?
[01:16:14.318 --> 01:16:15.438]  Really?
[01:16:15.438 --> 01:16:20.761]  The UN's own climate data says one foot and that's Cook numbers from the University of East Anglia.
[01:16:21.783 --> 01:16:25.024]  Because if you're going to carry out a fraud, you've only got to use one group.
[01:16:25.024 --> 01:16:27.685]  Because you don't want others to find out about it.
[01:16:27.685 --> 01:16:30.226]  Crimes are committed by very few people.
[01:16:30.226 --> 01:16:33.227]  People always say, well, with all these crimes going on, it would be leaked.
[01:16:33.227 --> 01:16:34.287]  There would be whistleblowers.
[01:16:34.287 --> 01:16:36.988]  There are whistleblowers!
[01:16:36.988 --> 01:16:37.929]  There's whistleblowers on 9-11!
[01:16:41.044 --> 01:16:53.556]  Speaking of the devil, out in California, the Defense Language School at Monterey, Colonel Stephen Butler, told the Associated Press, I don't know what's going on with 9-11, but these hijackers were trained at our bases.
[01:16:53.556 --> 01:16:54.837]  With spy clearances.
[01:16:54.837 --> 01:16:57.479]  Muhammad Atta was trained at U.S.
[01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:58.800]  military base.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.903]  From the dean of the school!
[01:17:01.903 --> 01:17:05.687]  Telling the public, I don't know what's going on, but these guys were in my school.
[01:17:08.237 --> 01:17:09.598]  Now you could say, well what does that mean?
[01:17:09.598 --> 01:17:11.840]  It means official stories of stinking fraud.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.261]  Do we know exactly what's going on?
[01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:14.342]  No.
[01:17:14.342 --> 01:17:15.723]  But it goes on and on.
[01:17:15.723 --> 01:17:18.004]  Alright, I'm digressing, I'm digressing.
[01:17:18.004 --> 01:17:25.330]  Perhaps I should just start getting into the climate situation right now and climate gay, but let's go back to your phone calls first.
[01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:28.932]  Let's talk to Laurel in Tejas, in Texas.
[01:17:28.932 --> 01:17:29.413]  Go ahead, Laurel.
[01:17:30.489 --> 01:17:35.331]  Hey Alex, greetings from Crystal Beach, down here, Ground Zero for Hurricane Ike.
[01:17:35.331 --> 01:17:37.632]  And I wanted to report snowflakes this morning.
[01:17:37.632 --> 01:17:40.053]  So, um, so much for global warming.
[01:17:40.053 --> 01:17:43.134]  That's right, it's snowing in Austin right now.
[01:17:43.134 --> 01:17:46.515]  I went outside on the last break to look and there's giant snowflakes coming down.
[01:17:46.515 --> 01:17:50.217]  But again, the Earth is warming.
[01:17:50.217 --> 01:17:51.577]  I wanted to give you a heads up.
[01:17:51.577 --> 01:17:56.259]  I just got a, um, on Facebook, there's a Dr. James Hansen.
[01:17:56.259 --> 01:17:57.980]  I'm not sure if you're familiar with him.
[01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:04.207]  He is going to be talking at the Wortham Center in Houston on the 7th.
[01:18:06.221 --> 01:18:08.403]  And he's one of these global warming persons.
[01:18:08.403 --> 01:18:10.925]  He was supposed to speak in October, but he was sick.
[01:18:10.925 --> 01:18:21.334]  So a bunch of the Tea Party groups and sorts like that, we're going to try to do another wonderful welcoming session like we did for Pelosi when she was there.
[01:18:21.334 --> 01:18:21.734]  Good.
[01:18:21.734 --> 01:18:24.497]  Everywhere these rats go, they should be confronted.
[01:18:24.497 --> 01:18:30.402]  We've really got to start getting the Tea Parties after Schwarzenegger, but he's their beloved Republican.
[01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:36.278]  Not necessarily, but I didn't know if there's a change.
[01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:40.026]  Newt Gingrich needs to be protested.
[01:18:40.026 --> 01:18:42.491]  That's another neocon calling for global government.
[01:18:43.206 --> 01:19:02.978]  But he's, they don't even say what national agency, governmental agency he's with, so I'm not quite sure if he's with NOAA or who he's with, but he's going to be out there on Monday night, and so we will be having... By the way, NOAA's been caught fixing numbers, so has the National Australian, the National New Zealand, and the National British Weather Services.
[01:19:02.978 --> 01:19:11.283]  It's all over the news, they've all been caught fixing their data in line with the UN, and four days ago the internal UN documents, AP and Fox covered it,
[01:19:11.963 --> 01:19:15.886]  Uh, came out where the UN was colluding behind the scenes to fix the data.
[01:19:15.886 --> 01:19:18.528]  Look, this climate gate goes to the very top.
[01:19:18.528 --> 01:19:22.130]  So, so again, when is this creature coming to Houston?
[01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:28.355]  So, so come on out, you know, if there's any, uh, we change or, you know, change, change, uh, Houston or whatever's out there.
[01:19:28.355 --> 01:19:37.161]  But one other thing, Alex, I just noticed this morning, too, and I haven't heard you talk about it, and I know it's kind of a change in topic, but maybe we can touch base on it.
[01:19:37.161 --> 01:19:38.482]  Sherry Jackson?
[01:19:39.443 --> 01:19:49.911]  I just saw a posting and when I saw her picture, I recognized her immediately from Aaron Russo's documentary, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:19:49.911 --> 01:19:51.633]  Uh-huh, what's going on?
[01:19:51.633 --> 01:19:53.294]  She's an IRS agent.
[01:19:53.294 --> 01:19:54.855]  Yes.
[01:19:54.855 --> 01:20:00.340]  She got found guilty and she's in prison and supposedly she's- It's horrible, we'll be right back.
[01:20:01.055 --> 01:20:04.217]  Do you want to get away from additives and preservatives in your food?
[01:20:04.217 --> 01:20:06.859]  Need alternatives to conventional food preparation?
[01:20:06.859 --> 01:20:09.440]  Do you want to save the fruits of your gardening labor?
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.801]  And are you looking for an excellent gift idea?

[01:21:01.003 --> 01:21:04.185]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Hunter safes.
[01:21:04.185 --> 01:21:07.947]  The makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:21:07.947 --> 01:21:10.808]  Graf Hunter safes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:21:10.808 --> 01:21:14.190]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle.
[01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:15.431]  Quality above all else.
[01:21:15.431 --> 01:21:19.953]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door or safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[01:21:19.953 --> 01:21:21.814]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[01:21:21.934 --> 01:21:22.454]  We're good to go!
[01:21:41.505 --> 01:21:41.705]  We're good.
[01:22:01.238 --> 01:22:05.342]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible, federal deficit spending?
[01:22:05.342 --> 01:22:09.607]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[01:22:09.607 --> 01:22:11.188]  You get less for your money.
[01:22:11.188 --> 01:22:17.074]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at MIDAS Resources.
[01:22:17.074 --> 01:22:17.114]  800-727-8000.
[01:22:18.055 --> 01:22:18.555]  I think so.
[01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:43.551]  We're good.
[01:23:01.508 --> 01:23:03.949]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[01:23:03.949 --> 01:23:05.829]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[01:23:05.829 --> 01:23:07.689]  NoMoreMortgage can change your life.
[01:23:07.689 --> 01:23:09.110]  We paid off all of our bills.
[01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:11.910]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:17.552]  With NoMoreMortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[01:23:17.552 --> 01:23:19.232]  Even have more money left over each month?
[01:23:19.232 --> 01:23:21.893]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[01:23:21.893 --> 01:23:22.293]  NoMoreMortgage.
[01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.614]  Where have they been all of our life?
[01:23:25.614 --> 01:23:28.116]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[01:23:28.116 --> 01:23:32.019]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[01:23:32.019 --> 01:23:34.181]  I'm Larry Ruff, President of No More Mortgage.
[01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:39.505]  This is unlike anything you have ever seen before, and it will absolutely not harm your credit.

[01:23:49.472 --> 01:23:49.913]  Call the number.
[01:23:54.036 --> 01:23:55.080]  Call now for your free CD!
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:55.320]  800-578-6279 800-578-6279
[01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:21.411]  I have to apologize.
[01:24:21.411 --> 01:24:24.594]  I said I googled the highest point in San Francisco this morning.
[01:24:24.594 --> 01:24:27.115]  Schwarzenegger says it's going to be underwater.
[01:24:27.115 --> 01:24:32.299]  And I said I found a 600 plus foot hill.
[01:24:32.299 --> 01:24:36.142]  I'm sorry, it's Mount Davison in San Francisco.
[01:24:36.142 --> 01:24:37.783]  It isn't really a mountain, they call it that.
[01:24:37.783 --> 01:24:42.006]  It's 900... I didn't print that sheet yet from their almanac.
[01:24:42.006 --> 01:24:42.146]  It's 930?
[01:24:44.332 --> 01:24:45.874]  Mount Davidson, how many feet is it?
[01:24:45.874 --> 01:24:49.657]  938.
[01:24:49.657 --> 01:24:51.800]  Mount Davidson, 938 feet.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:55.704]  So, according to Schwarzenegger, water is going to raise 938 feet.
[01:24:55.704 --> 01:25:04.132]  Now, the United Nations says, even with their Cook numbers, one foot or less.
[01:25:04.132 --> 01:25:04.573]  Well, it's now 938.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:07.741]  According to Schwarzenegger.
[01:25:25.468 --> 01:25:28.130]  Again, we need an article.
[01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:29.671]  The problem is they're frauds.
[01:25:29.671 --> 01:25:32.412]  Everything they say is a lie and a fraud.
[01:25:32.412 --> 01:25:39.436]  By the way, while we were searching sea levels, we happened to get tidal levels for the last hundred plus years measured from San Francisco.
[01:25:39.436 --> 01:25:42.357]  It's at the lowest point it's been since the early 1990s.
[01:25:42.357 --> 01:25:44.459]  The water level is lowering.
[01:25:45.422 --> 01:25:57.506]  In San Francisco and the few times that it's been higher was only for a day or so when there's been an offshore earthquake that thrust up underwater mountains and raised it a few feet.
[01:25:57.506 --> 01:26:00.907]  So it has nothing to do with man-made.
[01:26:00.907 --> 01:26:03.388]  I'm already getting into this and I meant to get into it later.
[01:26:03.388 --> 01:26:03.748]  It's just
[01:26:04.884 --> 01:26:06.564]  I can't handle these people anymore.
[01:26:06.564 --> 01:26:13.626]  Schwarzenegger is as bad as Al Gore saying polar bears can't swim, one of the greatest land swimmers on Earth, and hunt seals on ice packs.
[01:26:13.626 --> 01:26:15.767]  They're not out there stranded.
[01:26:15.767 --> 01:26:16.627]  They show children.
[01:26:16.627 --> 01:26:24.369]  A week ago on local TV, KVUE in Austin, they did another report saying polar bears are dying and can't swim.
[01:26:24.369 --> 01:26:26.290]  Polar bear numbers have more than tripled!
[01:26:26.290 --> 01:26:29.451]  Because people used to shoot them.
[01:26:29.451 --> 01:26:33.432]  Now the government stops you from it, so they're breeding everywhere, running around attacking people.
[01:26:35.638 --> 01:26:37.779]  A polar bear will annihilate a grizzly bear.
[01:26:37.779 --> 01:26:40.521]  That's why there's not a lot of grizzly bears in their range, because they'll kill them!
[01:26:40.521 --> 01:26:43.383]  It's the biggest bear in the world!
[01:26:43.383 --> 01:26:45.404]  There's no land animal meaner or tougher!
[01:26:45.404 --> 01:26:55.011]  It was originally known in the Greek translation to mean water bear, because the sailors that saw them hundreds of years ago said these things are always swimming around.
[01:26:55.834 --> 01:26:58.097]  But doesn't matter if you're the greatest land swimmer.
[01:26:58.097 --> 01:27:00.559]  If Al Gore says he invented the internet, he did it.
[01:27:00.559 --> 01:27:06.606]  And if Al Gore, in fact right now outside our office, I talked about this yesterday, it's freezing.
[01:27:06.606 --> 01:27:08.809]  And there's snowflakes coming down.
[01:27:08.809 --> 01:27:12.953]  And there's a semiconductor factory a hundred yards from where I sit.
[01:27:12.953 --> 01:27:15.877]  Maybe a hundred and thirty yards.
[01:27:17.008 --> 01:27:17.208]  I think
[01:27:36.219 --> 01:27:38.341]  In cold weather, you see what looks like smoke.
[01:27:38.341 --> 01:27:42.005]  It's not smoke, and I know most of you know that, but school kids don't.
[01:27:42.005 --> 01:27:52.474]  They're being taught that it's pollution coming out of power plants when nothing comes out of them but water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[01:27:52.474 --> 01:27:54.876]  And so they go, look at all the pollution!
[01:27:54.876 --> 01:27:57.259]  Polar bears can't swim, water vapor is evil.
[01:27:58.933 --> 01:28:00.213]  You know, this is giving me a headache.
[01:28:00.213 --> 01:28:09.316]  I actually got a headache earlier when I walked out there and pulled up the numbers for the sea level in San Francisco and found out it's dropped the last eight years massively.
[01:28:09.316 --> 01:28:17.399]  And when I went and found out that it's 900 plus feet above sea level in San Francisco, we need to find the median or the average sea level.
[01:28:18.885 --> 01:28:22.107]  I mean, San Francisco's up on big ol' hills.
[01:28:22.107 --> 01:28:35.297]  Doesn't matter to Schwarzenegger, that un-American piece of trash, when he's not posing for gay porno mags, he's running around, stealing from everybody, and banning television sets above 40 inches.
[01:28:35.297 --> 01:28:37.018]  This guy is a usurper!
[01:28:37.018 --> 01:28:38.199]  He's an outlander!
[01:28:38.199 --> 01:28:40.181]  Get out of my country, you degenerate!
[01:28:41.394 --> 01:28:48.080]  We have nothing against Austria, nothing against Germany, but I'm not over in your country becoming your governor trying to rob you!
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.881]  He's a criminal pirate!
[01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:51.283]  And we don't want him!
[01:28:51.283 --> 01:28:53.705]  And we don't want Al Gore!
[01:28:53.705 --> 01:28:56.067]  And he is a criminal pirate, by the way.
[01:28:56.067 --> 01:29:05.295]  Been caught in all sorts of inside scams and deals and working with Enron on the energy scam, and then they blamed it on Gray Davis so he could come into power, and I was fooled by all that.
[01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:13.993]  Great Avis was a gun grabber, so I got behind the recall thinking it'd be some good Republican senator or something that would run.
[01:29:13.993 --> 01:29:16.814]  No, it was Schwarzenegger.
[01:29:16.814 --> 01:29:18.875]  He's left of Mao Zedong.
[01:29:18.875 --> 01:29:24.878]  And by the way, I don't want just Schwarzenegger protested everywhere and people to infiltrate his meetings and scream the truth at him.
[01:29:24.878 --> 01:29:29.700]  I want Newt Gingrich, that New World Order pimp, running around calling for global carbon taxes.
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:31.201]  I want him routed.
[01:29:31.201 --> 01:29:31.701]  Not just that
[01:29:32.831 --> 01:29:34.992]  Lying scam artist Al Gore.
[01:29:34.992 --> 01:29:36.693]  Even Limbaugh's calling him a crook now.
[01:29:36.693 --> 01:29:37.774]  Good job, Limbaugh.
[01:29:37.774 --> 01:29:38.494]  Finally waking up.
[01:29:38.494 --> 01:29:39.855]  These are criminals.
[01:29:39.855 --> 01:29:41.115]  These are criminals!
[01:29:41.115 --> 01:29:42.376]  These are criminals!
[01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:43.577]  They are criminals!
[01:29:43.577 --> 01:29:45.058]  They are criminals!
[01:29:45.058 --> 01:29:51.541]  They want to lie to your children, lie to you, take over your local governments, and raise taxes!
[01:29:51.541 --> 01:29:52.942]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.942 --> 01:29:55.463]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.463 --> 01:29:58.165]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.774 --> 01:30:06.099]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:30:06.099 --> 01:30:10.623]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:30:10.623 --> 01:30:12.885]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:30:12.885 --> 01:30:14.527]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:30:14.527 --> 01:30:15.568]  There is a solution.
[01:30:15.788 --> 01:30:24.214]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:31:00.711 --> 01:31:04.816]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:31:04.816 --> 01:31:07.700]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:09.783]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:31:09.783 --> 01:31:12.026]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:31:12.026 --> 01:31:13.688]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:31:13.688 --> 01:31:17.994]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:31:48.496 --> 01:31:50.438]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:32:00.455 --> 01:32:05.018]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:32:05.018 --> 01:32:05.918]  Number one.
[01:32:05.918 --> 01:32:09.341]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.341 --> 01:32:10.201]  Number two.
[01:32:10.201 --> 01:32:15.104]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.104 --> 01:32:15.845]  It's true.
[01:32:15.845 --> 01:32:20.708]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:21.168]  Number three.
[01:32:21.528 --> 01:32:25.112]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.112 --> 01:32:29.836]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.836 --> 01:32:32.599]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.599 --> 01:32:35.942]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:37.043 --> 01:32:41.204]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.204 --> 01:32:46.245]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.245 --> 01:32:50.427]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.427 --> 01:32:52.207]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.207 --> 01:32:56.808]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:12.355 --> 01:33:14.816]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:14.816 --> 01:33:16.217]  Live, live, live.
[01:33:16.217 --> 01:33:19.178]  We've been live for the last hour and 33 minutes.
[01:33:19.178 --> 01:33:21.059]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:21.059 --> 01:33:21.679]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:22.300]  Central.
[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:23.540]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:23.860]  Eastern.
[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:28.623]  I come back with an abbreviated live broadcast Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:28.623 --> 01:33:30.984]  Because you can't stop the signal, you can't stop freedom.
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:35.323]  The people are standing up, getting involved, shattering the left-right paradigm.
[01:33:35.323 --> 01:33:48.855]  By the way, Jesse Ventura's television show that I was a major consultant on, and I also appear in quite a few of the episodes, the first episode aired Wednesday, the highest ratings ever for True TV, formerly Court TV.
[01:33:51.428 --> 01:33:56.412]  This is bigger opening ratings than Glenn Beck got with his first shows on Fox News.
[01:33:56.412 --> 01:34:06.121]  And the rating services, I'm going to go over this article later, are trending that by the end of the series, it's only a seven-parter for January, it'll probably have over four million viewers.
[01:34:06.121 --> 01:34:07.442]  Or dwarfing Glenn Beck.
[01:34:08.857 --> 01:34:21.262]  Man, I'm really excited because they've already told me if it gets picked back up, which I'm sure it will now, I'm going to be an even bigger part of the production, as you heard Jesse Ventura say last week with us, coming up.
[01:34:21.262 --> 01:34:28.966]  And people are shocked that it's anti-New World Order, it's our view, it's our angle, and people can't believe this is on television.
[01:34:28.966 --> 01:34:33.608]  They can't believe Ventura's going on Larry King Live saying 9-11's an inside job.
[01:34:33.608 --> 01:34:35.709]  Yes, Ventura is for real.
[01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:47.989]  I really started waking him up with others about four years ago, and as he's talked about here on air, and he's got a book coming out about the New World Order, we're really educating him quickly.
[01:34:47.989 --> 01:34:52.831]  And so, very, very exciting to see this happening.
[01:34:52.831 --> 01:34:55.992]  Ventura's not perfect, none of us are, but he's for real.
[01:34:55.992 --> 01:34:56.613]  He's real.
[01:34:56.613 --> 01:34:59.914]  What you see is what you get, and we are really educating him.
[01:34:59.914 --> 01:35:01.995]  As you heard in that hour-plus interview last week.
[01:35:02.932 --> 01:35:04.153]  So we're going to get into that.
[01:35:04.153 --> 01:35:05.814]  Let me tell you who's not real.
[01:35:05.814 --> 01:35:08.596]  This guy Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:35:08.596 --> 01:35:09.997]  This guy is a complete fraud.
[01:35:09.997 --> 01:35:15.380]  Now you can prove everything he's saying is a fraud in about five minutes.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:30.090]  Two segments ago, two breaks ago, I was here reading this Global Warming news article about Schwarzenegger where he says that
[01:35:31.843 --> 01:35:40.885]  Treasure Island, Alcatraz, and much of San Francisco will be under as much as 35 to 40 feet of water.
[01:35:40.885 --> 01:35:55.649]  Now, the United Nations IPCC, who has been caught cooking the books at three major universities, we have the emails between the universities, the head universities, their head climate centers engage in fraud.
[01:35:55.649 --> 01:36:00.570]  Even with their cooked data, it's less than a foot that they're saying it's going to race.
[01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:08.754]  The White House science czar is running around telling people 13 feet.
[01:36:08.754 --> 01:36:12.817]  Literally pulling it out of... Well, we have children listening.
[01:36:12.817 --> 01:36:14.598]  I'm not going to say where he's pulling it out from.
[01:36:14.598 --> 01:36:16.900]  You know what monkeys do at the zoo, though.
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:19.442]  The point is, where do monkeys get what they throw?
[01:36:19.442 --> 01:36:20.763]  I'm sorry.
[01:36:20.763 --> 01:36:22.064]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:36:22.064 --> 01:36:28.548]  Schwarzenegger looks like such a monkey with his hair implants up on top and his little steroided-out eyes.
[01:36:29.682 --> 01:36:31.563]  I mean, that guy is just a piece of trash.
[01:36:31.563 --> 01:36:33.983]  Get out of my country, you un-American piece of garbage.
[01:36:33.983 --> 01:36:35.224]  Just get out!
[01:36:35.224 --> 01:36:37.024]  Get out!
[01:36:37.024 --> 01:36:39.725]  Al Gore, get out of here, you piece of trash!
[01:36:39.725 --> 01:36:41.365]  Alright, alright, I'm not gonna get mad.
[01:36:41.365 --> 01:36:45.266]  It's been a long time since there's been an Alex Jones rant.
[01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:46.147]  And you know when I rant?
[01:36:46.147 --> 01:36:46.967]  It's when I get a headache.
[01:36:48.066 --> 01:36:50.808]  Because it's like overload, like Robbie the Robot.
[01:36:50.808 --> 01:36:52.188]  Cannot compute, cannot compute.
[01:36:52.188 --> 01:36:54.710]  Too much corruption, too much proof, too much fraud.
[01:36:54.710 --> 01:36:56.951]  Hundreds of world leaders calling for global government.
[01:36:56.951 --> 01:36:59.012]  The public's still dumbed down, not waking up.
[01:36:59.012 --> 01:37:01.634]  Cannot compute, cannot compute.
[01:37:01.634 --> 01:37:07.377]  And then I start screaming.
[01:37:07.377 --> 01:37:11.300]  But in one break, we Google the term
[01:37:12.745 --> 01:37:15.366]  Highest point in San Francisco.
[01:37:15.366 --> 01:37:18.027]  Did you guys run me the mountain in the print-off yet?
[01:37:18.027 --> 01:37:21.668]  This just happened 10 minutes ago.
[01:37:21.668 --> 01:37:22.949]  938 feet.
[01:37:22.949 --> 01:37:24.270]  Put it up on screen.
[01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:29.872]  Mount Davidson is the highest point in San Francisco.
[01:37:29.872 --> 01:37:33.673]  I'm gonna read off that in a moment.
[01:37:33.673 --> 01:37:33.993]  900 feet.
[01:37:33.993 --> 01:37:37.955]  Now, yeah, it's gonna be underwater, Schwarzenegger.
[01:37:37.955 --> 01:37:39.616]  A city on hills.
[01:37:39.616 --> 01:37:40.056]  But then,
[01:37:41.232 --> 01:37:49.838]  In our first Google search, we put in sea level in San Francisco, and instead got their tidal data of the last hundred years.
[01:37:49.838 --> 01:37:50.939]  And guess what it shows?
[01:37:50.939 --> 01:37:59.826]  Except for when there's earthquakes, the overall sea level of San Francisco is dropping, and in the last eight years, it's dropped a massive amount.
[01:37:59.826 --> 01:38:05.510]  The sea level is dropping, and of course, the Earth was heating, then it started cooling.
[01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:09.133]  Nine years ago, as the internal climate data shows, and so, oh, eight years ago,
[01:38:10.168 --> 01:38:15.376]  Blow that up on screen for people watching us at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:15.376 --> 01:38:22.807]  You average them together, you can see a few points where it raised when they had earthquakes, and you go to the data page, it reports that.
[01:38:24.073 --> 01:38:27.714]  But you see an overall dropping since the last big earthquake in 2005.
[01:38:27.714 --> 01:38:30.576]  That was the only time it went up for a while.
[01:38:30.576 --> 01:38:35.598]  And then you see a drop this year from last year and the year before and the year before that.
[01:38:35.598 --> 01:38:39.519]  And then a dropping before that going back to before 2000.
[01:38:39.519 --> 01:38:50.043]  And then we have a 140 year graph because it's been a big seaport and the sailors are meticulous about recording those.
[01:38:50.043 --> 01:38:51.544]  So we have that recorded back to 1850.
[01:38:54.912 --> 01:38:57.994]  We have sea levels recorded in San Francisco to 1850.
[01:38:57.994 --> 01:39:00.195]  And from 1850 until 1940, there was a trend up several feet.
[01:39:00.195 --> 01:39:09.600]  And then in 1940, a massive drop until 1960, a little bit of a rise, little bit of a rise, rising up into 1980, and now dropping.
[01:39:25.037 --> 01:39:26.458]  So, there you have it.
[01:39:26.458 --> 01:39:32.063]  And, of course, if these numbers showed it was spiking up, we'd have to go get our own numbers, because the scientists all get caught lying.
[01:39:32.063 --> 01:39:38.428]  But, again, these are numbers just collected by the, well, now the government of San Francisco and the federal government.
[01:39:38.428 --> 01:39:43.172]  But, again, sailors have always had a penchant for recording sea levels.
[01:39:43.172 --> 01:39:45.514]  This is something they want to know and understand.
[01:39:45.514 --> 01:39:50.457]  But the issue is, here is Schwarzenegger saying that
[01:39:51.648 --> 01:39:52.809]  Let me read the quote.
[01:39:52.809 --> 01:39:53.589]  Global warming.
[01:39:53.589 --> 01:40:04.795]  California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger puts his hand on top of a map over San Francisco's Treasure Island to show how it could be submerged in just a century.
[01:40:04.795 --> 01:40:10.659]  And then they're putting out these tourist reports and saying, oh, there won't be any wineries if it keeps heating.
[01:40:10.659 --> 01:40:16.082]  Though if you go back to the Middle Ages, the last time it really heated up, more wine was produced, more grapes.
[01:40:16.082 --> 01:40:17.822]  Northern England was growing good grapes.
[01:40:17.822 --> 01:40:18.363]  They can't now.
[01:40:20.046 --> 01:40:22.708]  So he lies about that and says you're not going to be able to have any wine.
[01:40:22.708 --> 01:40:24.449]  Oh, there won't be any snowboarding.
[01:40:24.449 --> 01:40:29.352]  None of this is going to happen because... Oh, and then he lies in the video and says, oh, there's no water.
[01:40:29.352 --> 01:40:39.920]  Yeah, because at eight different major reservoirs, mountain reservoirs, the government, for environmental reasons, in the last two years, as you've seen all over television, has cut the water off to the people.
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:47.965]  Just like Schwarzenegger and Enron cut the power off to everybody before he was even governor, he was involved in those meetings to jack up prices and make huge profits.
[01:40:47.965 --> 01:40:48.986]  He made money off that.
[01:40:52.935 --> 01:41:07.082]  So I need Paul Watson or Kurt Nemo or Aaron Dykes or Steve Watson, one of our writers, to just go get the data and show that, A, the UN itself says the water level is going to go up by one foot.
[01:41:07.082 --> 01:41:08.643]  And they might be right, because it fluctuates.
[01:41:08.643 --> 01:41:10.764]  It might go down two feet, it might go up five feet.
[01:41:10.764 --> 01:41:14.526]  The point is, they're saying that.
[01:41:14.526 --> 01:41:18.648]  Schwarzenegger is lying and saying much of San Francisco will be underwater.
[01:41:18.648 --> 01:41:19.349]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:41:20.294 --> 01:41:21.736]  I've been to San Francisco many times.
[01:41:21.736 --> 01:41:25.219]  You go back a quarter mile from the side of the ocean and you're in the hills.
[01:41:25.219 --> 01:41:26.741]  I mean, this is asinine.
[01:41:26.741 --> 01:41:31.726]  The UN says one foot, one foot, and that's a fraud.
[01:41:31.726 --> 01:41:35.489]  The truth is they don't know what's going to happen because the Earth is always changing.
[01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:37.852]  First it's global freezing, then it's global warming.
[01:41:37.852 --> 01:41:39.293]  Now they say climate change.
[01:41:40.154 --> 01:41:44.517]  Every time it's hot in the summer, they tell kids on Nickelodeon, oh my god, we're all roasting.
[01:41:44.517 --> 01:41:46.359]  You know, it's hot outside because of global warming.
[01:41:46.359 --> 01:41:50.802]  No, it's hot because the earth, the part of the earth we're on is tilted towards the sun!
[01:41:50.802 --> 01:41:55.526]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:59.589]  Just play the Schwarzenegger brainwashing video they put out.
[01:41:59.589 --> 01:42:07.735]  And then I'm going to play, two days ago, John P. Holdren, the White House science czar, who wrote Ecoscience,
[01:42:10.196 --> 01:42:12.757]  You know why I've been showing this book every day for the last year?
[01:42:12.757 --> 01:42:20.039]  Where the White House Science Czar writes a textbook saying he wants to put poison in the water to sterilize you and wants to reduce world population under a global government?
[01:42:20.039 --> 01:42:23.080]  These are quotes!
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:23.560]  Don't believe me?
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.920]  Just Google Ecoscience John P. Holdren.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:31.642]  You'll get Reuters AP with the stinking quotes in it.
[01:42:31.642 --> 01:42:33.343]  This guy getting grilled.
[01:42:33.343 --> 01:42:35.483]  So, that's coming up.
[01:42:35.483 --> 01:42:37.704]  But first, let's play Schwarzenegger, the liar.
[01:42:37.704 --> 01:42:38.064]  Here it is.
[01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:44.826]  The tour that we're about to take is designed to promote awareness of the challenges that we face from climate change.
[01:42:44.826 --> 01:42:50.052]  And the kind of things that we can do together to overcome those challenges.
[01:42:50.052 --> 01:42:53.035]  In California, we're already seeing this.
[01:42:53.035 --> 01:42:59.502]  When I was a bodybuilder that came out, I would rip people off on shows I put on and the movie I made and never pay them.
[01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:16.196]  And I was always scamming everyone and laughing about how stupid everybody is, and how I get it over on them, and how pathetic, and I would hand out records of Hitler speeches to people, and dress up like a Nazi at parties, and run into the gym screaming, down with the blacks!
[01:43:16.616 --> 01:43:17.357]  Down with them!
[01:43:17.357 --> 01:43:19.358]  They're not humans!
[01:43:19.358 --> 01:43:23.501]  It's so funny what I've done to everybody and how stupid you are!
[01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:24.921]  I want your guns!
[01:43:24.921 --> 01:43:26.963]  I want open borders!
[01:43:26.963 --> 01:43:30.725]  There's 30% unemployment in many areas of California!
[01:43:30.725 --> 01:43:31.906]  In fact, give me that article.
[01:43:31.906 --> 01:43:32.907]  I saw you guys printing it earlier.
[01:43:34.199 --> 01:43:35.860]  All of this is so funny!
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:43.023]  Now let me scare you, like you're a bunch of little stupid children, and tell you, you're all going to drown!
[01:43:43.023 --> 01:43:44.524]  You're all going to drown!
[01:43:44.524 --> 01:43:53.627]  If you don't let me tax everything, and if the legislature won't pass a law for me to ban TVs and tax them, then I'll just do it myself!
[01:43:53.627 --> 01:43:55.348]  Because I'm a dictator!
[01:43:55.348 --> 01:43:58.850]  I always dreamed of being a dictator, like Hitler!
[01:43:58.850 --> 01:44:01.611]  That's a quote, Rolling Stone.
[01:44:01.611 --> 01:44:01.691]  Oh!
[01:44:03.422 --> 01:44:07.411]  El Centro holds position for highest jobless rate in the country.
[01:44:07.411 --> 01:44:08.233]  CNN Money, 32.2%.
[01:44:12.090 --> 01:44:13.711]  Thirty-two percent.
[01:44:13.711 --> 01:44:14.752]  You like it?
[01:44:14.752 --> 01:44:16.112]  I know you do.
[01:44:16.112 --> 01:44:18.014]  I know you love it now.
[01:44:18.014 --> 01:44:19.875]  You're going to enjoy it a lot more.
[01:44:19.875 --> 01:44:22.796]  In fact, pull up Schwarzenegger race quotes.
[01:44:22.796 --> 01:44:25.058]  I want everybody to see this live on TV and radio.
[01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:32.062]  Just go to Google or startpage.com or any other great search engine and type in Schwarzenegger Hitler quotes.
[01:44:32.062 --> 01:44:39.867]  And I didn't, when I made martial law that has a section on Schwarzenegger in 2005, I didn't just believe the newspapers about this.
[01:44:39.867 --> 01:44:41.388]  I actually ordered the
[01:44:42.324 --> 01:44:50.451]  Rolling Stone, where he gave the interview, saying, I've always dreamed about powerful people like Hitler and being worshipped like Nuremberg, like a dictator.
[01:44:50.451 --> 01:44:53.673]  I want to be king of the world, and I'm going to be king of the world.
[01:44:53.673 --> 01:44:57.697]  And you're not going to be able to top me.
[01:44:57.697 --> 01:45:00.979]  You're not going to be able to top me.
[01:45:00.979 --> 01:45:02.941]  Because you're all so stupid and wanting.
[01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:07.410]  I never get over how pathetic people are, how dumb they are.
[01:45:07.410 --> 01:45:09.711]  I love to dominate stupid people.
[01:45:09.711 --> 01:45:11.491]  Well, I'm not stupid!
[01:45:11.491 --> 01:45:15.652]  Get out of here, you usurper crook!
[01:45:15.652 --> 01:45:17.913]  All these stupid Republican groups don't talk about Arnie.
[01:45:17.913 --> 01:45:24.215]  We like him wanting our guns.
[01:45:24.215 --> 01:45:28.756]  Now, just bring up Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hitler quote.
[01:45:28.756 --> 01:45:30.797]  Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes Rolling Stones.
[01:45:30.797 --> 01:45:32.798]  That'll get it for you.
[01:45:32.798 --> 01:45:33.818]  I wouldn't use Yahoo.
[01:45:35.219 --> 01:45:40.522]  Sorry, they don't have the best search engine in town.
[01:45:40.522 --> 01:45:43.304]  No offense to Yahoo.
[01:45:43.304 --> 01:45:44.625]  Okay, whatever.
[01:45:44.625 --> 01:45:45.506]  We'll pull those quotes up.
[01:45:45.506 --> 01:45:50.929]  They're in my film, Martial Law, too, with copies of The Rolling Stone and others.
[01:45:50.929 --> 01:45:59.675]  They were gonna release a few years ago the outtakes of him saying it on video for Pumping Iron, but he bought the film for like five times what it was worth just so that it wouldn't be released.
[01:45:59.675 --> 01:46:01.256]  Schwarzenegger now owns Pumping Iron.
[01:46:04.944 --> 01:46:05.985]  I'm going to go ahead now.
[01:46:05.985 --> 01:46:10.490]  Like I said, you'll want to search it in another search engine.
[01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:15.474]  I want to go ahead and just play, finish up with Schwarzenegger, then I'm going to play Holdren being grilled.
[01:46:15.474 --> 01:46:15.875]  Stay with us.
[01:46:18.852 --> 01:46:31.720]  Average temperatures in our state rose nearly 2 degrees, and if greenhouse gas emissions are not substantially reduced, scientists tell us that temperatures in California could rise an additional 7 degrees during this century.
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:32.420]  Lie!
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:33.121]  Back it up!
[01:46:33.121 --> 01:46:34.081]  Back it up!
[01:46:34.081 --> 01:46:34.962]  Back it up!
[01:46:34.962 --> 01:46:36.343]  I mean, this is just all lies.
[01:46:36.343 --> 01:46:41.646]  He uses the same IPCC hockey stick graph right there.
[01:46:41.646 --> 01:46:42.747]  That's a whole other scandal.
[01:46:42.747 --> 01:46:46.849]  I'll guarantee you that that's a fraud right there.
[01:46:46.849 --> 01:46:47.810]  When they have fires.
[01:46:48.863 --> 01:46:49.644]  Everybody in L.A.
[01:46:49.644 --> 01:46:54.708]  knows, the police know, you have nuts that go around setting fires everywhere when the winds get up every year.
[01:46:54.708 --> 01:47:02.774]  And they go, look, there are fires, the global warming, give me your money.
[01:47:02.774 --> 01:47:05.616]  No, it's that you've got 10 million people in L.A.
[01:47:05.616 --> 01:47:11.480]  with a couple thousand lunatics that go into the rich areas and try to burn everything down because they hate wealth.
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:13.682]  It's not the global warming doing it.
[01:47:13.682 --> 01:47:15.724]  Let's go back to the global warming man.
[01:47:15.724 --> 01:47:17.565]  I am Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:47:17.565 --> 01:47:18.046]  Here he is.
[01:47:18.942 --> 01:47:28.249]  And if greenhouse gas emissions are not substantially reduced, scientists tell us that temperatures in California could rise an additional seven degrees during this century.
[01:47:28.249 --> 01:47:29.449]  Oh, yeah.
[01:47:29.449 --> 01:47:34.293]  Perhaps one of the greatest risks from climate change is a less reliable water supply.
[01:47:34.293 --> 01:47:39.877]  Californians have long struggled with it.
[01:47:39.877 --> 01:47:45.921]  See, he knows that people are aware of the water supply and the fact the government's cutting it off at every front.
[01:47:45.921 --> 01:47:46.702]  But they don't care.
[01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:50.656]  He's gonna tell you, you know, humans have never had problems with water supply.
[01:47:50.656 --> 01:47:55.365]  You know, we shouldn't dig more wells, or build desalinization, or not let the government keep the water back.
[01:47:55.365 --> 01:47:58.071]  No, it's climate change that's doing it.
[01:47:58.071 --> 01:47:58.732]  Back to the liar.
[01:48:00.936 --> 01:48:08.122]  And those shortages are expected to get worse as temperatures rise and as we lose our precious Sierra snowpack.
[01:48:08.122 --> 01:48:17.570]  Projections shown here indicate that if global warming continues unabated, the spring snowpack in the Sierra Nevada will virtually disappear by the end of the century.
[01:48:18.356 --> 01:48:29.287]  This would pose extreme challenges to water managers, hamper hydropower generation, and nearly eliminate skiing, snowboarding and other recreational activities.
[01:48:29.287 --> 01:48:36.254]  Now another area of concern for California is our 1,100 miles of scenic coastline.
[01:48:36.254 --> 01:48:39.398]  Our coast, home to over 25 million people,
[01:48:39.938 --> 01:48:47.402]  He's vulnerable to a range of natural hazards, including storms, high tides, and rising sea levels.
[01:48:47.402 --> 01:48:58.649]  By investing in green technology, we can create a new economic foundation for the 21st century that is built on clean fuel, clean energy, and clean cars.
[01:48:58.649 --> 01:49:03.192]  Now, one terrific example is, for instance, the car company called Tesla Motors.
[01:49:03.192 --> 01:49:04.612]  Tesla manufactures cars.
[01:49:04.612 --> 01:49:08.895]  That's enough from him, and you can go watch his press conference online saying San Francisco will be underwater.
[01:49:10.216 --> 01:49:15.260]  And they candy coat things like clean cars, new technology, sounds good, it's taxes.
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:21.604]  They just put a bunch of things that sound reasonable up front so people hear it and it sounds reasonable and they can get on board with it.
[01:49:21.604 --> 01:49:25.908]  Now remember, Schwarzenegger got in trouble with Kurt Waldheim, the top Nazi.
[01:49:25.908 --> 01:49:27.609]  He was also the head of the UN.
[01:49:27.609 --> 01:49:32.452]  Turned out the UN knew he was an SS officer, just like Schwarzenegger's dad.
[01:49:32.452 --> 01:49:36.135]  And Waldheim, of course, was a eugenicist for world population reduction.
[01:49:36.135 --> 01:49:38.257]  So, of course, Schwarzenegger is gonna be for eugenics.
[01:49:39.175 --> 01:49:45.201]  Global warming is the eugenics front, their excuse to shut off your resources.
[01:49:45.201 --> 01:49:56.211]  Now when we come back from break, I am going to, yeah you can go to ArnoldExposed.com, you notice you found one of my websites, and that actually has the quotes.
[01:49:56.211 --> 01:49:59.234]  Go to the quotes, see on the side, it says the quote links.
[01:50:01.483 --> 01:50:04.344]  And it has his quotes.
[01:50:04.344 --> 01:50:07.145]  I thought about the fame, about just being the greatest.
[01:50:07.145 --> 01:50:14.628]  I was dreaming about being some dictator of a country or some savior like Jesus.
[01:50:14.628 --> 01:50:17.469]  My relationship to power and authority is I'm all for it.
[01:50:17.469 --> 01:50:18.369]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:50:19.514 --> 01:50:19.794]  U.S.
[01:50:19.794 --> 01:50:21.895]  News and World Report 1990.
[01:50:21.895 --> 01:50:23.916]  People need somebody to watch over them.
[01:50:23.916 --> 01:50:29.179]  95% of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[01:50:29.179 --> 01:50:30.360]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, U.S.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.181]  News and World Report.
[01:50:32.181 --> 01:50:36.843]  My friends don't want me to mention Kurt's name because of all the recent Nazi stuff and the U.N.
[01:50:36.843 --> 01:50:37.724]  controversy.
[01:50:37.724 --> 01:50:40.105]  But I love him, and Maria does too.
[01:50:40.105 --> 01:50:41.106]  And so thank you, Kurt.
[01:50:42.054 --> 01:50:46.956]  Arnold Schwarzenegger on his friend and fellow Austrian Kurt Volthein, the Nazi war criminal.
[01:50:46.956 --> 01:50:48.557]  I was born to be a leader.
[01:50:48.557 --> 01:50:51.599]  I love the fact that millions of people look up to me.
[01:50:51.599 --> 01:50:53.960]  I'll find you some Hitler quotes here in a minute.
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:56.721]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:56.721 --> 01:50:57.862]  Stay with us.
[01:50:57.862 --> 01:51:01.544]  We'll show you Holdren being grilled straight ahead.
[01:51:01.544 --> 01:51:06.186]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good
[01:51:09.110 --> 01:51:09.471]  We're good.
[01:51:24.352 --> 01:51:33.960]  PureBulk.com's products contain no fillers, no additives, no fancy retail packaging, and no minimum purchase, allowing you to save 50 to 90 percent over store-bought supplements.

[01:51:45.049 --> 01:51:45.309]  I don't know.
[01:52:01.368 --> 01:52:02.669]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.669 --> 01:52:08.254]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.254 --> 01:52:13.278]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.278 --> 01:52:18.862]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that it could even happen again.
[01:52:18.862 --> 01:52:23.546]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:24.059 --> 01:52:31.183]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:31.183 --> 01:52:32.303]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.303 --> 01:52:38.987]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.987 --> 01:52:42.189]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:42.189 --> 01:52:45.190]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.190 --> 01:52:45.451]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.451 --> 01:52:45.691]  Remember,
[01:52:58.991 --> 01:53:05.816]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[01:53:05.816 --> 01:53:10.100]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:20.928]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[01:53:20.928 --> 01:53:21.869]  These key ingredients
[01:53:26.564 --> 01:53:27.125]  I think so.
[01:53:43.424 --> 01:53:44.025]  I don't know.
[01:54:02.548 --> 01:54:08.372]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:08.372 --> 01:54:10.753]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:10.753 --> 01:54:14.416]  Standing up to scammers, crooks, criminals, usurpers everywhere.
[01:54:14.416 --> 01:54:15.236]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:54:15.236 --> 01:54:17.578]  This is a five and a half minute clip.
[01:54:17.578 --> 01:54:18.518]  This segment's five minutes.
[01:54:18.518 --> 01:54:23.542]  We're going to play part of it, come back with the rest, then Bob Chapman and your phone calls will shift into the economy and a bunch of other
[01:54:24.893 --> 01:54:28.135]  Back to the emails that ended up being placed in the public record.
[01:54:28.135 --> 01:54:30.756]  And I don't want to get to whether or not
[01:54:47.844 --> 01:54:50.526]  They were legally placed in the public record.
[01:54:50.526 --> 01:54:53.327]  The question is whether or not they were accurate.
[01:54:53.327 --> 01:54:56.629]  Because if they were accurate, it's profoundly disturbing.
[01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:59.251]  And it does end up putting the question to all of the sides.
[01:54:59.251 --> 01:54:59.911]  They're admitted to be accurate.
[01:54:59.911 --> 01:55:00.792]  They're admitted to be real.
[01:55:00.792 --> 01:55:01.432]  Climate change.
[01:55:01.432 --> 01:55:03.113]  I want to add that.
[01:55:03.113 --> 01:55:08.116]  Now, the data from the Climate Research Unit at the UEA in England
[01:55:08.627 --> 01:55:13.831]  is one of only three major data sets, but they considerably overlap.
[01:55:13.831 --> 01:55:19.436]  And they've been used as a basis for the IPCC report, as well as the U.S.
[01:55:19.436 --> 01:55:21.818]  Global Change Research Program.
[01:55:21.818 --> 01:55:32.406]  And that means that these two booklets that were passed out this morning, you know, at best need to have a thorough review in the light of this information that has been disclosed.
[01:55:32.972 --> 01:55:39.237]  And at worst, it's junk science and it is a part of a massive international scientific fraud.
[01:55:40.134 --> 01:55:51.339]  Now, Dr. Holden, you've been in the middle of a lot of this, and I've got a couple of questions based upon your statements before you joined the Obama administration.
[01:55:51.339 --> 01:56:04.586]  You gave an interview in August of 2006 with BBC News in the UK, and you said that a sea level rise of up to 13 feet was in the realm of possibility.
[01:56:05.509 --> 01:56:16.472]  However, that's 11 feet higher than what the IPPC has estimated over this period of time, which is somewhere between 7 and 23 inches.
[01:56:16.472 --> 01:56:21.054]  Now, with respect to the hockey stick theory, which the chairman has referred to,
[01:56:22.633 --> 01:56:28.217]  That's been pretty much discredited in the scientific community.
[01:56:28.217 --> 01:56:45.191]  And yet, in your October 13th email, which is now in the public record, you aggressively attacked the two scientists that put this together, a Dr. Willie Soon and a Dr. Sally Balyunas for that.
[01:56:50.458 --> 01:56:54.199]  I think it's pretty clear that in both cases you were wrong.
[01:56:54.199 --> 01:57:07.522]  And I guess I'd like to know if you're concerned now that you're in the White House and representing all of the public, whether you're concerned about the misrepresentation of the state of science with respect to global warming.
[01:57:07.522 --> 01:57:16.585]  And I'd also like to know if you still support the principal critic of those who trashed the hockey stick theory.
[01:57:18.437 --> 01:57:31.363]  And that is a Dr. Michael Mann, knowing of his efforts now to hide his data and to encourage his colleagues to shut out journals like Climate Research to publish works contrary to his own bias.
[01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:41.076]  Congressman, let me try to take those in the order you asked them and the very first part of your statement.
[01:57:41.076 --> 01:57:48.183]  With respect, I would disagree with you that this current uproar calls into question all of climate science.
[01:57:48.183 --> 01:57:55.410]  We're going to come back and finish the last few minutes of Pinhead up there lying.
[01:57:55.410 --> 01:57:56.932]  But you notice he said uproar.
[01:57:56.932 --> 01:57:58.013]  They know it's an uproar.
[01:57:59.226 --> 01:58:04.514]  That's why Gore is now cancelling a lot of his speaking engagements and in Copenhagen cancelling his big engagement.
[01:58:04.514 --> 01:58:07.879]  Because everywhere they go, people are shouting them down, bringing up Climategate.
[01:58:07.879 --> 01:58:11.705]  They just can't sit up there and push their fraud now without being challenged.
[01:58:12.608 --> 01:58:15.630]  People are challenging them everywhere.
[01:58:15.630 --> 01:58:21.395]  And so they're kind of retreating for now, hoping we forget about this so they can come back and continue setting up their global government.
[01:58:21.395 --> 01:58:28.420]  And that's Ban Ki-moon, head of the UN, Secretary General, saying the carbon tax is the funding mechanism for the world government.
[01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:32.002]  That's what I report in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:58:32.002 --> 01:58:34.464]  It exposes the whole climate gate fraud.
[01:58:34.464 --> 01:58:40.669]  That's why everybody needs to get it on DVD at InfoWars.com and get a free Obama t-shirt, anti-Obama t-shirt, when they do.

[02:00:17.835 --> 02:00:24.317]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.317 --> 02:00:29.680]  Halfway into this transmission, Bob Chapman joining us after the break to break down the economy.
[02:00:31.155 --> 02:00:39.401]  Your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 as well on this Friday, December 4, 2009 edition.
[02:00:39.401 --> 02:00:43.924]  We're continuing exposing the ClimateGate fraud, now into week number two.
[02:00:43.924 --> 02:00:59.435]  And here's Holdren, after he was just exposed as a fraud, saying, well, I don't think this uproar brings into question that sea levels are going to rise 13 feet, when no one's saying that but him and Schwarzenegger, literally just making this up, and sea levels have actually dropped in San Francisco.
[02:01:00.367 --> 02:01:01.048]  Here we go.
[02:01:01.048 --> 02:01:01.748]  Here's the rest of it.
[02:01:01.748 --> 02:01:05.771]  Try to take those in the order you asked them.
[02:01:05.771 --> 02:01:14.658]  And the very first part of your statement, with respect, I would disagree with you that this current uproar calls into question all of climate science.
[02:01:14.658 --> 02:01:17.581]  I do not believe that it remotely... Well, sir, I didn't say that.
[02:01:17.581 --> 02:01:19.442]  I said it ought to be looked at again.
[02:01:19.442 --> 02:01:24.146]  And you know, there's increasing evidence of scientific fascism that's going on.
[02:01:24.566 --> 02:01:38.195]  And I think as policy makers who are making decisions about the state of the American economy for the next several generations, that we ought to have accurate science, and it appears there's enough question on whether the science we have is accurate.
[02:01:38.195 --> 02:01:40.257]  That's got to be... Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:40.257 --> 02:01:41.117]  Back up a few seconds.
[02:01:41.117 --> 02:01:42.258]  That's key.
[02:01:42.258 --> 02:01:53.086]  See, this is a private group of banks that are openly Goldman Sachs and others financing the carbon taxes, Al Gore and others, where you will pay taxes directly to them, then they give some of it to the UN.
[02:01:53.925 --> 02:01:55.767]  And they share it with your local communities.
[02:01:55.767 --> 02:01:59.370]  Hence, federalizing, internationalizing, and privatizing.
[02:01:59.370 --> 02:02:00.891]  This is piracy.
[02:02:00.891 --> 02:02:04.514]  This is a takeover of our entire economy.
[02:02:04.514 --> 02:02:07.516]  They said they want to abolish coal-powered fuel.
[02:02:07.516 --> 02:02:09.358]  51% of our power comes from coal.
[02:02:09.358 --> 02:02:13.942]  This is a total hijacking by these criminals that want a monopoly.
[02:02:13.942 --> 02:02:15.763]  This is a takeover!
[02:02:15.763 --> 02:02:16.484]  Go back to it!
[02:02:18.863 --> 02:02:19.383]  We're good to go.
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:58.183]  In this book, Ecoscience, where he says he wants to drug the water supply to sterilize you and set up a planetary regime to carry out forced one-child policies.
[02:02:58.183 --> 02:03:00.743]  They're now teaching that in public schools worldwide.
[02:03:00.743 --> 02:03:01.524]  Right here in the U.S.
[02:03:01.524 --> 02:03:02.604]  it's being taught.
[02:03:02.604 --> 02:03:03.184]  We have the U.N.
[02:03:03.184 --> 02:03:07.725]  documents where they talk about how they're brainwashing your kids through the Department of Education.
[02:03:07.725 --> 02:03:10.066]  In here, he said we were going to have an ice age by 2000.
[02:03:10.066 --> 02:03:11.346]  He wrote this in, what, 1976?
[02:03:11.346 --> 02:03:11.827]  Or was it 1974?
[02:03:11.827 --> 02:03:12.547]  I've got Ecoscience.
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:22.363]  1977.
[02:03:22.363 --> 02:03:23.604]  Where's the Ice Age?
[02:03:23.604 --> 02:03:29.870]  You are a scientific fraud by design, and you're not going to investigate your own scientist engaged in fraud for you!
[02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:31.652]  You're in the emails, Holdren!
[02:03:31.652 --> 02:03:33.914]  You're involved in the fraud, you criminal!
[02:03:33.914 --> 02:03:34.535]  Back to him!
[02:03:35.322 --> 02:03:37.422]  We will get to the bottom of this one.
[02:03:37.422 --> 02:03:49.245]  But the key point is, however this particular controversy comes out, the result will not call into question the bulk of our understanding of how the climate works or how humans are affecting it.
[02:03:49.245 --> 02:03:53.606]  You mentioned an interview of mine a few years ago.
[02:03:53.606 --> 02:03:55.406]  I can't help it.
[02:03:55.406 --> 02:03:59.767]  The UN's own IPCC fairytale says that
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:09.825]  The ocean's gonna be between 7 inches and 23 inches, but you really read, they said the mean's about 1 foot, 12 inches.
[02:04:09.825 --> 02:04:13.448]  Then he says it's settled that men, that man is changing the climate.
[02:04:13.448 --> 02:04:19.751]  The UN's own report says man is 3-4% of the gases that they claim are heating things up.
[02:04:19.751 --> 02:04:20.792]  It's a fraud!
[02:04:20.792 --> 02:04:25.275]  One volcano puts out more than man's put out in the last 100 years!
[02:04:25.275 --> 02:04:26.656]  He's a complete liar!
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:31.063]  Let's come back from break, play the last minute of this, and then go to Bob Chapman.
[02:04:31.063 --> 02:04:33.465]  But I'm really getting a headache here, just looking at this.
[02:04:33.465 --> 02:04:35.728]  This is a sinister little eugenicist.
[02:04:35.728 --> 02:04:38.471]  Little population reducer.
[02:04:38.471 --> 02:04:39.612]  This guy makes me sick!
[02:04:45.325 --> 02:04:45.805]  Stay with us.
[02:04:45.805 --> 02:04:49.007]  Bob Chapman coming up with the latest with the Federal Reserve being rounded.
[02:04:49.007 --> 02:04:50.228]  So much other good news.
[02:04:50.228 --> 02:04:51.129]  More on ClimateGate.
[02:04:51.129 --> 02:04:52.630]  Your phone calls.
[02:04:52.630 --> 02:04:54.091]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:04:54.091 --> 02:04:55.892]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:55.892 --> 02:04:59.194]  We're also simulcasting via television at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:02.239 --> 02:05:06.260]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:09.481]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.481 --> 02:05:14.282]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:05:14.282 --> 02:05:20.683]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:20.683 --> 02:05:22.924]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:23.444 --> 02:05:24.885]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:05:24.885 --> 02:05:25.625]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:25.625 --> 02:05:27.726]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:42.372 --> 02:05:49.639]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:05:49.639 --> 02:05:58.768]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:06:01.479 --> 02:06:04.480]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:09.823]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.823 --> 02:06:11.863]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.863 --> 02:06:16.866]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.866 --> 02:06:18.046]  How much do you want?
[02:06:18.046 --> 02:06:19.167]  When do you want it?
[02:06:19.167 --> 02:06:21.067]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:21.067 --> 02:06:22.128]  When will you need it?
[02:06:22.128 --> 02:06:24.329]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.329 --> 02:06:25.669]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:26.990]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.190 --> 02:06:32.456]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.456 --> 02:06:36.061]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:36.061 --> 02:06:39.865]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.865 --> 02:06:41.106]  How much will you need?
[02:06:41.106 --> 02:06:42.007]  We don't know.
[02:06:42.007 --> 02:06:43.109]  How much do you want?
[02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:44.050]  All you can get.
[02:06:44.050 --> 02:06:44.851]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.111 --> 02:06:48.175]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:48.175 --> 02:06:49.937]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.937 --> 02:06:50.858]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:07.453]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:07:07.453 --> 02:07:09.534]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:07:09.534 --> 02:07:11.776]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:07:11.776 --> 02:07:13.436]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:07:13.436 --> 02:07:17.918]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:07:17.918 --> 02:07:20.480]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:25.122]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:07:25.202 --> 02:07:26.483]  For your home or business.
[02:07:26.483 --> 02:07:31.265]  Their bestseller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[02:07:31.265 --> 02:07:34.107]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[02:07:34.107 --> 02:07:36.828]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[02:07:36.828 --> 02:07:43.992]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[02:07:44.212 --> 02:07:46.473]  Going to Bob Chapman here in just a moment.
[02:07:46.473 --> 02:07:47.293]  You know, when I call
[02:08:13.561 --> 02:08:14.462]  Holdren, a criminal.
[02:08:14.462 --> 02:08:22.109]  He's involved with the criminal emails, helping cover it up, helping persecute scientists that were telling the truth.
[02:08:22.109 --> 02:08:26.953]  And he's involved wanting to bring in an economic system that will at least double our energy prices.
[02:08:26.953 --> 02:08:29.275]  That's only one facet of it.
[02:08:29.275 --> 02:08:33.880]  And will devastate American families for his own profit and Al Gore's profit.
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:36.983]  Now, if that isn't criminal, as Lord Monckton has said, they should all be arrested.
[02:08:37.765 --> 02:08:40.386]  And Lord Mocta wouldn't come out with that unless we had clear evidence.
[02:08:40.386 --> 02:08:41.747]  These people are despicable.
[02:08:41.747 --> 02:08:42.847]  Let's finish up with Holdren.
[02:08:42.847 --> 02:08:44.168]  Here it is.
[02:08:44.168 --> 02:08:49.390]  ...in which I talked about the possibility of a sea level rise in this century as much as 13 feet.
[02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:55.193]  That was based on scientific peer-reviewed publications that appeared in the early 2000s... Dead pause!
[02:08:55.193 --> 02:09:03.397]  ...that indicated that over... And all of that data came from these three climate research units that are all together in the emails cooking the books.
[02:09:05.179 --> 02:09:10.421]  See, they keep saying, okay, forget ClimateGate, we have peer-reviewed journals that are based on the fraud!
[02:09:10.421 --> 02:09:15.084]  See, everything he says is a debunkable lie instantly when you know the facts.
[02:09:15.084 --> 02:09:15.824]  Back to Holdren.
[02:09:16.741 --> 02:09:19.442]  You're still 11 feet above what the IPCC was recommending.
[02:09:19.442 --> 02:09:21.103]  My time is almost up and I'd just like to
[02:09:41.052 --> 02:09:46.999]  You know, say that there's an awful lot of scientific McCarthyism, meaning name-calling, going on.
[02:09:46.999 --> 02:10:00.676]  Because I quote from your email of October 13, 2003, saying, doing this will reveal that Soon and Balayounis are essentially amateurs in the interpretation of historical and paleoclimatology
[02:10:00.996 --> 02:10:01.396]  Thank you.
[02:10:24.611 --> 02:10:29.840]  I would be happy to answer all of the congressman's questions if I'm allowed.
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:36.131]  You will be given enough time, but let me turn right now and recognize the gentleman from Washington State.
[02:10:36.131 --> 02:10:38.214]  Yeah, let's not let that information come out.
[02:10:39.827 --> 02:10:42.008]  Bob Chapman was in Army Intelligence.
[02:10:42.008 --> 02:10:44.628]  Bob Chapman had the biggest private newsletter until he retired.
[02:10:44.628 --> 02:10:48.390]  He came back, one of the biggest again, the internationalforecaster.com.
[02:10:48.390 --> 02:10:55.632]  Bob has been at one time the biggest private silver and gold broker, and we always enjoy having him visit with us at least once a week.
[02:10:56.032 --> 02:10:58.733]  Well, I never thought you'd ask because I've just done about 30 radio programs on it.
[02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:39.797]  And one of the things that I uncovered was that, and I don't know if you mentioned it or not, because I just cut in toward the end, the CRU received $23 million in taxpayers' funds.
[02:11:39.797 --> 02:11:41.439]  Did you highlight that?
[02:11:41.439 --> 02:11:44.141]  Yes, we wrote stories about that last week.
[02:11:44.141 --> 02:11:49.606]  That's just one funding group going to Professor Phil Jones at East Anglia.
[02:11:49.606 --> 02:11:52.229]  Yeah, Phil is no longer there, as you well know.
[02:11:54.623 --> 02:11:57.785]  I guess his comment was, it was so gracious of him to let me go.
[02:11:57.785 --> 02:12:06.994]  And I think he's extremely worried about getting criminal charges brought against him.
[02:12:06.994 --> 02:12:12.278]  And of course, the university didn't want to have anything to do with him anymore.
[02:12:12.278 --> 02:12:17.984]  The phrase was, I am so grateful to the university for agreeing to this.
[02:12:18.666 --> 02:12:19.846]  But anyway, it is.
[02:12:19.846 --> 02:12:26.729]  And for those that don't know, Phil Jones is the head kingpin for the UN over all the universities getting this data together.
[02:12:26.729 --> 02:12:33.011]  This is the head guy caught with Holdren and everybody else engaged in fraud.
[02:12:33.011 --> 02:12:40.354]  Well, hopefully this will stop cap-and-trade and knock the Copenhagen meeting on its ear.
[02:12:40.354 --> 02:12:43.996]  And I don't know whether that'll happen because these people are so arrogant.
[02:12:43.996 --> 02:12:46.337]  They don't care what happens.
[02:12:46.337 --> 02:12:47.317]  They do what they want to do.
[02:12:48.577 --> 02:12:56.823]  But I think we got them on the run here, and especially with Congress getting into it quickly the way that they have.
[02:12:56.823 --> 02:13:00.586]  It just shows you how criminal these people are.
[02:13:00.586 --> 02:13:06.470]  So we switch away from academic fraud to financial fraud.
[02:13:07.419 --> 02:13:11.540]  And the financial fraud, of course, is going on in Wall Street.
[02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:19.142]  And the same fraudsters from Wall Street are the ones, Kinlay and others, and Madoff that engineered this and are working with Al Gore and others.
[02:13:19.142 --> 02:13:22.663]  Break that down as a segue into the economy.
[02:13:22.663 --> 02:13:27.364]  Well, the whole thing is about taxation.
[02:13:27.364 --> 02:13:30.205]  And so is in Copenhagen.
[02:13:30.205 --> 02:13:34.726]  And they want to hit them on both of them, they, taxpayers,
[02:13:35.462 --> 02:13:42.787]  from Western Europe and the United States for about 20% increase in their taxation from each.
[02:13:42.787 --> 02:13:50.192]  So if you pay them 30% and 5 to the state and you get 40 on top of that, you're in for 75 plus all the little taxes.
[02:13:50.192 --> 02:13:55.636]  So it's pretty devastating and it's really a tax enslavement.
[02:13:58.706 --> 02:13:59.667]  It is, Bob.
[02:13:59.667 --> 02:14:00.988]  So much is going on with this.
[02:14:00.988 --> 02:14:05.051]  We'll get back into it later and take some phone calls, but where do you want to start?
[02:14:05.051 --> 02:14:16.500]  The good news with open talk by Senator Sanders and others of blocking the confirmation, the re-confirmation of the private Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke.
[02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:21.625]  The fact that, as you know, a week and a half ago, it passed out a committee to audit the Fed.
[02:14:21.625 --> 02:14:25.568]  It looks like the Senate may try to block it, but still, this is a huge success.
[02:14:25.568 --> 02:14:27.449]  Or the lies about unemployment numbers.
[02:14:27.449 --> 02:14:28.050]  Where do we begin?
[02:14:29.468 --> 02:14:32.129]  Well, the unemployment numbers are to be expected.
[02:14:32.129 --> 02:14:44.031]  And the scenario today, and I don't know if Ted is coming on later, but he would have something strong to say about this, but the unemployment numbers are totally bogus.
[02:14:44.031 --> 02:14:51.532]  I'll show you the coincidence of events that happened last Thursday when Dubai was announced.
[02:14:51.532 --> 02:14:55.153]  And, of course, they picked that day because the American market was closed.
[02:14:56.045 --> 02:14:59.672]  And they did that so that the market wouldn't fall 500 points, it only fell 150.
[02:14:59.672 --> 02:15:07.687]  And it was managing the Dow Jones Industrial and S&P and NASDAQ indexes, if you may.
[02:15:08.544 --> 02:15:11.506]  At the same time, they hit gold for $50.
[02:15:11.506 --> 02:15:13.667]  It came back to a minus 12.
[02:15:13.667 --> 02:15:16.988]  The following day, it went up, and then Monday, the same.
[02:15:16.988 --> 02:15:21.290]  And then, of course, they come in today and attack voraciously.
[02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:25.573]  They hit gold for $50 again, like they did before.
[02:15:25.573 --> 02:15:27.293]  And they're not hitting the physical market.
[02:15:27.293 --> 02:15:29.375]  They're hitting it with derivatives.
[02:15:29.375 --> 02:15:32.796]  And they did the same thing with silver, but not in as big a way.
[02:15:32.796 --> 02:15:37.559]  And they have the dollar up almost a point today on the USDX index.
[02:15:39.628 --> 02:15:43.589]  This is all coordinated.
[02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:49.350]  The numbers come out, the numbers are phony.
[02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:53.011]  The Dubai thing, they knew about that for months.
[02:15:53.011 --> 02:15:57.012]  They just picked a date and coordinated all this together.
[02:15:57.012 --> 02:15:58.853]  And so what's going to happen?
[02:15:58.853 --> 02:16:03.154]  The dollar's going to go back down again, because there's too many sellers out there.
[02:16:03.154 --> 02:16:07.615]  Gold and silver are going to go back up again, so it gives you a great opportunity to be a buyer.
[02:16:08.709 --> 02:16:22.115]  When you wouldn't normally have this opportunity, and the stock market's going to start getting weaker again, and they'll pay for Dubai over, probably over the next several years.
[02:16:22.115 --> 02:16:35.342]  It looks to me that they're probably offside over there, somewhere between $80 and $120 billion, which, in the circumference of everything, is really not a great amount.
[02:16:35.342 --> 02:16:38.063]  It might seem that it is, but nowadays when you have the
[02:16:38.635 --> 02:16:45.239]  The Fed lending out $12.7 trillion, another $100 billion is easy to cover up.
[02:16:45.239 --> 02:16:48.801]  Let me stop you for a moment, because you're an expert on this and I'm not.
[02:16:48.801 --> 02:16:56.866]  We had Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts on two weeks ago, who for those who don't know is a former editor of the Wall Street Journal, former head of policy, Department of Treasury, under Reagan.
[02:16:58.021 --> 02:17:06.749]  And he predicted on air that the dollar in the next few weeks would go back up because of this reverse carry trade that they have to cover themselves.
[02:17:06.749 --> 02:17:08.190]  And can you explain that to people?
[02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:17.458]  And that gold would go down for a while, but then go back up even higher because they can drive stuff down now as part of their manipulation, but they can't hold it down.
[02:17:17.458 --> 02:17:18.459]  That's true.
[02:17:18.459 --> 02:17:22.603]  And we brought this out, you and I, in this program a number of times.
[02:17:22.603 --> 02:17:25.085]  They affect the market for a day or two or three, and that's it.
[02:17:25.632 --> 02:17:27.954]  And it's the same thing with the currency market.
[02:17:27.954 --> 02:17:36.240]  Goodness, they trade over $4 trillion a day in the forex, of which probably $2 to $2.5 trillion is in dollars.
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:40.323]  And so you try to manipulate that market more than one day, forget it.
[02:17:40.323 --> 02:17:50.271]  And it's got to be a coordinated effort where all of the bids on the other currencies in the USDX are hit.
[02:17:50.271 --> 02:17:51.352]  And then that's what they're doing.
[02:17:51.352 --> 02:17:54.314]  They're not making the dollar go up, they're making the other ones go down.
[02:17:54.949 --> 02:18:06.335]  The other ones being the Pound, the Yen, the Swiss Franc, the Canadian Dollar, and the British Pound, and the Swedish Krona.
[02:18:06.335 --> 02:18:07.995]  And so, they just hit the bids on them.
[02:18:07.995 --> 02:18:16.680]  And that was what the $500 billion currency swamp was all about, about six or seven months ago.
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:23.523]  Because the other five nations that were involved received dollars, and they take those dollars
[02:18:23.932 --> 02:18:26.189]  And they go in and buy treasuries with them.
[02:18:26.189 --> 02:18:26.330]  U.S.
[02:18:26.330 --> 02:18:26.693]  treasuries.
[02:18:27.463 --> 02:18:40.431]  At the same time, the foreign currencies that were received by the Federal Reserve, they take those foreign currencies and they go in and sell them, making the foreign currencies go down and making the dollar go up.
[02:18:40.431 --> 02:18:41.632]  That's the game they're playing.
[02:18:41.632 --> 02:18:47.255]  And that's what Chapman, you've said in the past, in the last few weeks, that's exactly what Roberts said.
[02:18:47.255 --> 02:18:50.097]  What's the time frame then for gold that's down $45 today?
[02:18:50.097 --> 02:18:50.277]  It's at $1,162.
[02:18:53.999 --> 02:18:58.122]  What's the best-guess time frame on when it'll go back up and when the dollar's going to drop?
[02:18:58.122 --> 02:19:00.263]  Middle of next week?
[02:19:00.263 --> 02:19:00.924]  Probably.
[02:19:00.924 --> 02:19:07.488]  And another thing, too, is for those of you who... and I'm going to try to make this as simple as possible.
[02:19:07.488 --> 02:19:19.796]  In the pits of the comics, there are what they call the commercial traders in both silver and gold, and in this case, they're the same players to some extent.
[02:19:19.796 --> 02:19:22.218]  JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup,
[02:19:22.907 --> 02:19:25.769]  Hong Kong, Shanghai Bank, etc.
[02:19:25.769 --> 02:19:38.559]  And in gold, they have a short position net, because they have longs and shorts at the same time, net of 306,000 contracts.
[02:19:38.559 --> 02:19:41.221]  That's the highest it's ever been.
[02:19:41.221 --> 02:19:46.886]  A normal contract for the short position for the commercials, as they're called, is 95,000.
[02:19:46.886 --> 02:19:49.948]  So it's just about triple.
[02:19:50.916 --> 02:19:53.438]  And they're really hung out to dry.
[02:19:53.438 --> 02:20:00.064]  Explain what that means in layman's terms on the other side as we break down the rigged market with Bob Chapman.
[02:20:01.633 --> 02:20:09.376]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[02:20:09.376 --> 02:20:17.959]  AirAndAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[02:20:17.959 --> 02:20:22.721]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[02:20:22.721 --> 02:20:26.642]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[02:20:26.642 --> 02:20:30.784]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[02:20:31.064 --> 02:20:31.624]  We're good.
[02:21:01.764 --> 02:21:09.510]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:15.594]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:21:15.594 --> 02:21:18.216]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:21:18.556 --> 02:21:24.839]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:21:24.839 --> 02:21:28.901]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:21:28.901 --> 02:21:34.524]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:21:34.524 --> 02:21:36.325]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:21:36.605 --> 02:21:38.347]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:21:38.347 --> 02:21:40.889]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:21:40.889 --> 02:21:45.613]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:21:45.613 --> 02:21:49.316]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:21:49.316 --> 02:21:52.438]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:21:52.438 --> 02:21:54.340]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:56.461]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:22:01.562 --> 02:22:08.250]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:08.250 --> 02:22:16.359]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:16.359 --> 02:22:21.945]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[02:22:22.265 --> 02:22:24.527]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[02:22:24.527 --> 02:22:29.610]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:29.610 --> 02:22:34.834]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:34.834 --> 02:22:39.177]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:39.177 --> 02:22:40.278]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:40.278 --> 02:22:44.782]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:44.782 --> 02:22:46.163]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:49.665 --> 02:22:52.666]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:52.666 --> 02:22:56.548]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.548 --> 02:22:57.989]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:57.989 --> 02:23:03.331]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:23:03.331 --> 02:23:09.214]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:23:09.214 --> 02:23:17.278]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[02:23:18.194 --> 02:23:21.056]  Rely on OxySilver instead.
[02:23:21.056 --> 02:23:26.899]  OxySilver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[02:23:26.899 --> 02:23:30.180]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[02:23:30.180 --> 02:23:32.542]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.
[02:23:32.542 --> 02:23:37.444]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[02:23:37.444 --> 02:23:41.186]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[02:23:41.186 --> 02:23:43.427]  So get it while you still can.
[02:23:43.427 --> 02:23:46.209]  Order OxySilver online at OxySilver.com.
[02:23:47.336 --> 02:23:50.919]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[02:23:50.919 --> 02:23:54.042]  Call toll-free 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:23:54.042 --> 02:23:56.684]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:23:56.684 --> 02:23:58.365]  Order OxySilver today.
[02:23:58.365 --> 02:24:06.132]  This call could save your life.
[02:24:06.132 --> 02:24:10.696]  Alright, Bob, you were getting into market manipulation and
[02:24:11.929 --> 02:24:18.691]  Going over how they're triple short what they normally would be for people that aren't involved in the stock market or things they don't understand.
[02:24:18.691 --> 02:24:20.672]  Then coming back, I want to get into the good news.
[02:24:20.672 --> 02:24:22.912]  The Federal Reserve is in a lot of trouble.
[02:24:22.912 --> 02:24:29.214]  National polls show that just 21% favor Ben Bernanke being reappointed as the Fed chairman.
[02:24:29.214 --> 02:24:33.935]  So we're going to be talking about that and playing some clips of his grilling yesterday.
[02:24:33.935 --> 02:24:35.476]  But Bob Chapman, continue.
[02:24:36.809 --> 02:24:45.501]  Well, when you short something like gold bullion or silver bullion or gold stocks and silver stocks, you bet they're going to go down.
[02:24:45.501 --> 02:24:52.872]  And what you have to do eventually is you have to buy back the security that you sold, even though you didn't own it.
[02:24:54.034 --> 02:25:01.520]  And in this case, it's gold bullion that we're talking about, and there's a silver bullion market, and I cover that all the time in the International Forecaster.
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:04.082]  But this is a record short.
[02:25:04.082 --> 02:25:05.543]  Now, who's short?
[02:25:05.543 --> 02:25:07.604]  The United States government's short.
[02:25:07.604 --> 02:25:14.429]  They're the ones who are in there shorting the gold and silver market, and they're shorting the shares as well.
[02:25:14.429 --> 02:25:20.494]  And at least with the shares, we get a good idea of the breakdown of who's doing what.
[02:25:21.587 --> 02:25:27.353]  On the Bullion Exchange and the ComEx, you can't tell because they won't tell you.
[02:25:27.353 --> 02:25:31.837]  They just give you a total whole figure of what they call commercials.
[02:25:31.837 --> 02:25:35.861]  But in the shares you can tell because they have to state their positions.
[02:25:35.861 --> 02:25:43.728]  So we know that JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of New York, Citigroup, Barclays,
[02:25:44.797 --> 02:25:45.858]  And on and on.
[02:25:45.858 --> 02:25:47.279]  These are the shorts in there.
[02:25:47.279 --> 02:25:52.103]  And we know how much they're short, just like we do in the bullion market.
[02:25:52.103 --> 02:25:57.848]  And so there's a concentrated effort for the last couple of months to drive down all of those prices.
[02:25:57.848 --> 02:26:02.892]  And also, even in the commodity market as well, trying to hold those prices down.
[02:26:02.892 --> 02:26:06.876]  But that's a little bit more difficult to do because they're wider markets.
[02:26:06.876 --> 02:26:09.778]  And so that's what our government is doing in the market right now.
[02:26:09.778 --> 02:26:10.559]  And at the same time,
[02:26:11.175 --> 02:26:16.559]  They're trying to make the dollar go up, as I explained, and how they do that.
[02:26:16.559 --> 02:26:20.482]  And they also are trying to keep the stock market from falling.
[02:26:20.482 --> 02:26:32.351]  So they're coming in with mountains of fiat, derivatives made up money, debt, and they're manipulating the market, trying to drive gold down.
[02:26:32.351 --> 02:26:34.333]  Please continue.
[02:26:34.333 --> 02:26:38.236]  And they're not, as Alex said, and as Mr. Roberts said,
[02:26:40.359 --> 02:26:44.701]  At best, they can keep it going for a day or two, and that's it.
[02:26:44.701 --> 02:26:50.902]  The dollar's going to go back down, the market's going to go back down, commodities are going to go back up, and gold and silver's going to go back up.
[02:26:50.902 --> 02:26:51.983]  So what do you do?
[02:26:51.983 --> 02:27:04.206]  You take advantage of the fact that the gold shares are down 10%, the coins are probably off 3 or 4 or 5%, and you go in and you buy, if you can.
[02:27:04.206 --> 02:27:07.007]  You add to your collection, if you can.
[02:27:07.007 --> 02:27:08.007]  You take advantage of
[02:27:08.883 --> 02:27:10.504]  Abnormal dip.
[02:27:10.504 --> 02:27:17.566]  It's my projection that gold will test $1,550 to $1,650 by the 1st of April.
[02:27:17.566 --> 02:27:18.666]  And I think that we'll get that high.
[02:27:18.666 --> 02:27:20.067]  I think that's where this run is going.
[02:27:20.067 --> 02:27:22.927]  And I think that we would have had a normal mini correction anyway.
[02:27:39.249 --> 02:27:41.011]  I mean, no markets go up.
[02:27:41.011 --> 02:27:44.634]  We've had 21 of the 23 up days in gold.
[02:27:44.634 --> 02:27:46.436]  Well, you've got to have a correction.
[02:27:46.436 --> 02:27:47.957]  People take profits.
[02:27:47.957 --> 02:27:49.298]  Not everybody is investors.
[02:27:49.298 --> 02:27:51.120]  Some of them are traders.
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:57.766]  So, I expected somewhere between 25 and 150 points.
[02:27:57.766 --> 02:28:01.890]  And that would take gold back to somewhere in the vicinity of $1,100.
[02:28:01.890 --> 02:28:04.553]  Well, they've already done that for us.
[02:28:05.979 --> 02:28:13.686]  So what we have done is corrected the technical situation of being overbought.
[02:28:13.686 --> 02:28:17.270]  We'll get a little ground floor somewhere in here and go right back up again.
[02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:18.891]  Let me ask you this, Bob Chapman.
[02:28:18.891 --> 02:28:23.516]  Again, your predictions have always been devastatingly accurate here on air, so people are really taking notes.
[02:28:24.778 --> 02:28:31.641]  Two weeks ago, they tried to dump, as you know, billions and billions, tens of billions of dollars of gold in the market, thinking that would drive it down.
[02:28:31.641 --> 02:28:35.663]  But instead, the Indians, the Chinese and others grabbed it all up.
[02:28:35.663 --> 02:28:42.146]  Why was that manipulation to drive it down not successful, but this one has been?
[02:28:42.146 --> 02:28:48.489]  I think that what they've done is they've gone and talked to these entities.
[02:28:49.561 --> 02:28:53.184]  Such as India, why did you go out and take 200 tons of gold down?
[02:28:53.184 --> 02:29:00.429]  And Sri Lanka and Mauritania, whose orders were relatively inconsequential.
[02:29:00.429 --> 02:29:08.375]  But I think they really leaned on the Chinese, because the Chinese came out and said, well, we hope that this isn't a gold bubble here.
[02:29:08.375 --> 02:29:11.638]  Well, you've got to be kidding me, the Chinese aren't that stupid.
[02:29:11.638 --> 02:29:18.243]  So, that means that they were asked to say that, to keep the price of gold from running further.
[02:29:19.139 --> 02:29:28.246]  And I'm sure the story that was given by Geithner to the Chinese was, look, if it backs off, you can buy it cheaper.
[02:29:28.246 --> 02:29:32.149]  We just don't, we want it down for right now.
[02:29:32.149 --> 02:29:35.131]  And believe me, this sort of thing goes on.
[02:29:35.131 --> 02:29:39.334]  And so the Chinese come out and said something, and that didn't help the market, it backed off.
[02:29:39.334 --> 02:29:40.635]  What are the Chinese doing today?
[02:29:40.635 --> 02:29:41.376]  They're in there buying.
[02:29:43.331 --> 02:29:48.977]  Alright, I want to shift gears out of this area and get into what's happening with the Federal Reserve and unemployment numbers.
[02:29:48.977 --> 02:29:51.840]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.840 --> 02:29:53.242]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.242 --> 02:29:55.765]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.765 --> 02:29:58.447]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:00.942 --> 02:31:06.248]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.248 --> 02:31:10.793]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.793 --> 02:31:13.056]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:13.056 --> 02:31:14.678]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.678 --> 02:31:15.739]  There is a solution.

[02:32:00.782 --> 02:32:04.164]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:32:04.164 --> 02:32:07.786]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:32:07.786 --> 02:32:12.368]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:32:12.368 --> 02:32:17.951]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:32:18.251 --> 02:32:23.015]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:32:23.015 --> 02:32:26.657]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:32:26.657 --> 02:32:31.461]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:32:31.461 --> 02:32:38.025]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:32:38.025 --> 02:32:39.967]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:32:40.447 --> 02:32:43.650]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:33:09.244 --> 02:33:10.705]  I'll take yours too!
[02:33:10.705 --> 02:33:14.127]  You're fire musket, but I'll run you through!
[02:33:14.127 --> 02:33:20.110]  So when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand, there's no turning back!
[02:33:20.110 --> 02:33:22.471]  The viewer serves, the challenge begins!
[02:33:22.471 --> 02:33:26.013]  But on this battlefield, no one wins!
[02:33:26.013 --> 02:33:28.595]  The smell of ice, like smokin' horse's breath!
[02:33:50.213 --> 02:33:56.637]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have identified the private fellow who serves as the enemy of the Republic.
[02:33:56.637 --> 02:33:58.238]  The beginning of the end is here.
[02:33:58.238 --> 02:34:01.179]  Keep rolling it for everybody out there.
[02:34:01.179 --> 02:34:03.061]  You take my life, but I take yours too.
[02:34:03.061 --> 02:34:05.382]  You fire a musket, but I run you through.
[02:34:16.099 --> 02:34:19.403]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:34:19.403 --> 02:34:20.865]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:34:20.865 --> 02:34:22.828]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:34:22.828 --> 02:34:26.052]  I want to play a few clips here of the grilling of
[02:34:28.993 --> 02:34:33.975]  Ben Bernanke and others yesterday as the truth of what these guys have done.
[02:34:33.975 --> 02:34:52.344]  These are the same bankers who changed the policies and when the government wouldn't give them unlimited trillions last October, they went out on the news and said we're going to have martial law, depression if you don't do this, the market dropped several thousand points, the government panicked, passed it, they stole the money and said we won't say where it went.
[02:34:53.382 --> 02:34:55.043]  Now they want even more money.
[02:34:55.043 --> 02:34:58.085]  These are the made-off Kinley type criminals.
[02:34:58.085 --> 02:34:59.505]  This is the criminal group.
[02:34:59.505 --> 02:35:05.689]  These are the illegitimate people that run our country and run our government and are running it into the ground.
[02:35:06.809 --> 02:35:12.171]  And so I want to go ahead and play a short clip with Judge Napolitano yesterday.
[02:35:12.171 --> 02:35:20.215]  And there's hours of this where Republicans and Democrats said, we want you gone Bernanke.
[02:35:20.215 --> 02:35:24.036]  But, you know, they're throwing Phil Jones under the bus for climate fraud.
[02:35:24.036 --> 02:35:28.498]  He's only the kingpin of the scientists, low level compared to Al Gore and George Soros.
[02:35:28.498 --> 02:35:29.619]  They're throwing him under the bus.
[02:35:30.199 --> 02:35:32.440]  They're trying to throw Bernanke under the bus.
[02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:34.140]  No, it's not going to end there.
[02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:37.381]  You can't just give the public a sacrificial hog.
[02:35:37.381 --> 02:35:38.502]  Okay?
[02:35:38.502 --> 02:35:39.382]  We want them all.
[02:35:39.382 --> 02:35:43.403]  We're going to talk about that with Bob Chapman here in just a moment.
[02:35:43.403 --> 02:35:52.786]  But first, here is Judge Napolitano.
[02:35:52.786 --> 02:35:54.387]  Go ahead and play it whenever you guys are
[02:35:56.553 --> 02:35:58.494]  Okay, I thought we had that saved to computer.
[02:35:58.494 --> 02:35:59.515]  Well, okay.
[02:35:59.515 --> 02:36:01.837]  Man, these computers are just having a meltdown in there lately.
[02:36:01.837 --> 02:36:03.097]  Nothing's working.
[02:36:03.097 --> 02:36:06.420]  It used to, like, always work, and now it doesn't.
[02:36:06.420 --> 02:36:12.104]  Do you, you know, I think we have too many videos loaded in on that system.
[02:36:12.104 --> 02:36:17.447]  And so we're going to have to go to something else here, because this is just not working live on radio.
[02:36:17.447 --> 02:36:20.169]  Not working at all.
[02:36:20.169 --> 02:36:22.150]  What about the other clip we've got from the hearings?
[02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.671]  Do you have that?
[02:36:23.848 --> 02:36:25.789]  From that Asian news channel?
[02:36:25.789 --> 02:36:26.929]  Okay, we'll play whatever you can.
[02:36:26.929 --> 02:36:30.851]  Here we go.
[02:36:30.851 --> 02:36:40.116]  ...term at the helm of the Central Bank expires next month, faced unusually blunt talk from lawmakers critical of the Fed's actions during the crisis.
[02:36:40.116 --> 02:36:43.197]  Senator Jim Bunning is a Republican from Kentucky.
[02:36:43.197 --> 02:36:51.281]  You put the printing presses into overdrive to fund the government spending and hand out cheap money to your masters on Wall Street.
[02:36:52.219 --> 02:37:02.510]  Which they use to rake in record profits while ordinary Americans and small businesses can't even get loans for their everyday needs.
[02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:11.099]  But in a forceful defense of the Fed's efforts during the crisis, many of them unprecedented, Bernanke said authorities prevented a calamity.
[02:37:11.792 --> 02:37:26.422]  As severe as the effects of the financial crisis have been, however, the outcome could have been markedly worse without the strong actions taken by the Congress, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and other authorities both here and abroad.
[02:37:26.422 --> 02:37:30.825]  He also said, the economy appears to be on demand.
[02:37:30.825 --> 02:37:37.450]  Today, most indicators suggest that financial markets are stabilizing and that the economy is emerging from the recession.
[02:37:37.450 --> 02:37:39.351]  Yet our task is far from complete.
[02:37:40.615 --> 02:37:49.857]  Far too many Americans are without jobs, and unemployment could remain high for some time, even if, as we anticipate, moderate economic growth continues.
[02:37:49.857 --> 02:37:57.178]  Despite the tough questioning, a second term for Bernanke does not appear in doubt.
[02:37:57.178 --> 02:38:05.560]  Okay, and then we're going to try this other clip one more time here, where there's some other grilling that goes on.
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:05.920]  Here it is.
[02:38:10.942 --> 02:38:12.843]  ...members of the Senate Banking Committee.
[02:38:12.843 --> 02:38:24.467]  Bernanke wants that second term as head of the Federal Reserve, but Republican Senator Jim Bunning called him, quote, a moral hazard, and then added this.
[02:38:24.467 --> 02:38:28.829]  Where I come from, we punish failure, not reward it.
[02:38:28.829 --> 02:38:35.932]  That is certainly the way it was when I played baseball, and it is the way across all America presently.
[02:38:37.128 --> 02:38:46.775]  Judging by the current Treasurer's Secretary, some may think Washington does reward failure, but that should not be the case.
[02:38:46.775 --> 02:38:54.080]  I will do everything I can to stop your nomination and drag out this process as long as I can.
[02:38:54.778 --> 02:39:02.083]  Now Independent and Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has threatened to put a hold on Ben Bernanke's nomination.
[02:39:02.083 --> 02:39:02.603]  Let's see.
[02:39:02.603 --> 02:39:08.207]  A conservative and a socialist agree on at least one thing.
[02:39:08.207 --> 02:39:10.329]  No more Bernanke.
[02:39:11.263 --> 02:39:16.447]  With me now, no fan of the Fed, Congressman Ron Paul of Texas.
[02:39:16.447 --> 02:39:25.234]  Okay, so there's a few minutes of that, and you can just go to YouTube and type in Bernanke Grilled, and there's just hundreds of these in the last few months.
[02:39:25.234 --> 02:39:39.205]  They've gone from treating him with reverence and shaking when he comes in, oh Federal Reserve, oh you are the god of our country, thank you for all you do, now to hey, you're a bunch of crooks, we know you engineered this, we know you gave the money to yourself, you need to get in trouble.
[02:39:39.205 --> 02:39:39.666]  And now,
[02:39:41.675 --> 02:39:46.220]  311 sponsors, it's passed out a committee to audit the Fed, a strong bill to audit the Fed.
[02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:49.863]  Auditing the Fed, as Bernanke has said, will destroy the Fed.
[02:39:49.863 --> 02:39:52.425]  It's a private holding company for the big central banks.
[02:39:52.425 --> 02:40:03.095]  Bob Chapman, for those that may have just joined us, explain to people what the Federal Reserve is, how big this is, that we have 80 plus percent of Americans in some polls wanting to abolish or audit the Fed.
[02:40:03.615 --> 02:40:11.198]  We have a new poll out, just 21% from Rasmussen, favor Bernanke's reappointment as Fed Chairman.
[02:40:11.198 --> 02:40:12.598]  But it's not just Bernanke.
[02:40:12.598 --> 02:40:14.219]  It's like shark teeth.
[02:40:14.219 --> 02:40:16.800]  You pull out one tooth, another tooth rolls forward.
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:22.742]  We have to get rid of the shark itself, the private Federal Reserve banking dictatorship, don't we?
[02:40:22.742 --> 02:40:25.363]  We certainly do, and I think we're well on our way to doing that.
[02:40:26.372 --> 02:40:35.885]  And you know, there's about 310 to 311 co-sponsors of the House bill, and it certainly looks like it's going to pass.
[02:40:35.885 --> 02:40:43.275]  And after the grilling that went on, and the exposure that got right down to the nitty-gritty of what was going on,
[02:40:43.995 --> 02:40:47.818]  Uh, is going to throw this thing forward to be passed.
[02:40:47.818 --> 02:40:50.040]  And I think it'll be passed in the Senate.
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:54.244]  And, uh, I think we'll have a hard look at what goes on in the Fed.
[02:40:54.244 --> 02:40:58.167]  And the people aren't going to like it because it's been going on for 96 years.
[02:40:58.167 --> 02:41:03.091]  And when they look back and see all of these cycles, they were deliberately created.
[02:41:04.117 --> 02:41:14.083]  You know, maybe their predecessors at the Treasury Department during the 1870s and 80s and 90s and up until 1905 did a terrible job.
[02:41:14.083 --> 02:41:15.283]  Maybe they did.
[02:41:15.283 --> 02:41:18.805]  But these guys have done a hell of a lot worse, let me tell you.
[02:41:18.805 --> 02:41:25.489]  And so, the Federal Reserve is privately owned, as Alex said, and there's 12 banks that own it.
[02:41:25.489 --> 02:41:29.251]  And then they have the top shareholders who have held the stock in the Fed
[02:41:30.303 --> 02:41:35.505]  Since 1913, and they are American and European bankers.
[02:41:35.505 --> 02:41:47.691]  And the core, the very heart, the nexus of what goes on within the power behind government emanates from the Fed.
[02:41:47.691 --> 02:41:54.754]  This is the handmaiden of control of our entire country, our economy, our foreign policy.
[02:41:55.596 --> 02:42:01.140]  They control Congress through campaign contributions.
[02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:02.941]  Both parties are involved.
[02:42:02.941 --> 02:42:05.383]  It isn't a Democrat or Republican thing.
[02:42:05.383 --> 02:42:07.044]  It's both of them.
[02:42:07.044 --> 02:42:12.048]  And I'm glad to see that Bernie was involved.
[02:42:12.048 --> 02:42:19.573]  I like seeing socialists and conservatives together because, like you say, Alex, it throws out the left-right paradigm.
[02:42:19.573 --> 02:42:23.596]  Let's do what's good for America and we'll sort all the other stuff out later.
[02:42:26.667 --> 02:42:28.569]  Well, Bob, here's the problem.
[02:42:28.569 --> 02:42:41.059]  Like they did last October and like they've done in the last month, the private Fed chairman, the Treasury head, they come out and threaten and say, if you try to audit the Fed, that will cause the economy to implode.
[02:42:41.059 --> 02:42:43.442]  If you don't give us more money, the economy will implode.
[02:42:44.492 --> 02:42:55.155]  And it's just like one of the professors says in Fall of the Republic, this is like the end of Blazing Saddles where they have the sheriff surrounded, the corrupt sheriff, and he puts a gun to his head and says, stop or I'll shoot.
[02:42:55.155 --> 02:42:57.655]  This is like suicide by cop.
[02:42:57.655 --> 02:43:02.157]  They're saying, you do what we say or we will destroy the economy.
[02:43:02.157 --> 02:43:06.658]  But we do what they say and they destroy the economy because they want to consolidate it.
[02:43:06.658 --> 02:43:08.878]  I mean, this is not going to be clean.
[02:43:08.878 --> 02:43:10.099]  This is going to be messy.
[02:43:10.099 --> 02:43:11.439]  But the beginning of the end,
[02:43:12.059 --> 02:43:29.715]  For these people has begun because now we've gone from 10 years ago maybe 1 out of 20 people knowing the Fed was the real government, the shadow government, to now over 80% knowing it's the real government and so they're not addressing puppet Obama, puppet Bush, puppet McCain, puppet Pelosi.
[02:43:29.715 --> 02:43:31.817]  They're addressing the real government.
[02:43:31.817 --> 02:43:33.619]  We're having a real dialogue now.
[02:43:34.938 --> 02:43:45.703]  You know, we're attacking the real core of what's going on, and all of the peripheral things that you've just mentioned are secondary in importance.
[02:43:45.703 --> 02:44:00.129]  And so, I am amazed, amazed that there's 80% of the people, and you know, it shows up on the other side with the 21% who back Bernanke.
[02:44:00.129 --> 02:44:02.770]  I mean, that's 80% going the other way that don't.
[02:44:03.462 --> 02:44:13.091]  And so the public on this issue, from listening to your program and programs like it, and on the Internet, they've gotten themselves educated.
[02:44:13.091 --> 02:44:21.679]  And very, very quickly, I think over the last two years, we've had this buildup of knowledge, which is fantastic.
[02:44:21.679 --> 02:44:23.941]  And if we can shut down the Fed,
[02:44:25.163 --> 02:44:29.304]  And get the job back to the Treasury Department in whatever form they want.
[02:44:29.304 --> 02:44:34.925]  And get rid of private bankers, private Fed representatives in the Treasury.
[02:44:34.925 --> 02:44:41.847]  I was just going to say, we've got to stop the revolving door between Wall Street and the Treasury Department.
[02:44:41.847 --> 02:44:46.768]  We do those two things, and we resurrect Andrew Jackson, and we get it made.
[02:44:49.031 --> 02:44:54.835]  But, this crew is going to stage terror attacks, wars, martial law before they let us do it.
[02:44:54.835 --> 02:45:00.979]  But, since the people are now awake to all of that, it's only a matter of time before these people fall.
[02:45:00.979 --> 02:45:04.421]  I mean, that's why they would never say the Federal Reserve was private.
[02:45:04.421 --> 02:45:08.244]  That's why we would read official UN documents calling for world government.
[02:45:08.244 --> 02:45:10.645]  The media would say we were nuts it didn't exist.
[02:45:10.645 --> 02:45:15.569]  Because they could never admit that there was an illegitimate shadow global corporate government.
[02:45:15.569 --> 02:45:18.571]  Because then people would stop being distracted by the puppets
[02:45:19.091 --> 02:45:22.512]  And actually start having a debate about the real power structure.
[02:45:22.512 --> 02:45:31.073]  And now that people know there's a global government, now that it's admitted we're going into world government, now more and more whistleblowers are coming out, exposing them.
[02:45:31.073 --> 02:45:38.795]  I mean, we've got a long, hard road to follow here, but at the end of it, we're gonna beat these people.
[02:45:38.795 --> 02:45:41.455]  We are, and we're gonna get our country back.
[02:45:41.455 --> 02:45:46.916]  And it is gonna be nasty, and they do have the ability to take the economy down anytime they feel like it.
[02:45:47.757 --> 02:45:51.038]  And so if we challenge them and they lose, they are going to take it down.
[02:45:51.038 --> 02:45:52.698]  But it's going to go down anyway.
[02:45:52.698 --> 02:45:54.979]  And it should have went down in the first place.
[02:45:54.979 --> 02:45:56.520]  That's classical economics.
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:46:03.602]  We don't stand around and allow the Fed Reserve or the likes of it to do what they've done.
[02:46:03.602 --> 02:46:04.882]  We take the economy down.
[02:46:04.882 --> 02:46:08.463]  In 1920-21, we had the same situation.
[02:46:08.463 --> 02:46:12.244]  And the president just walked away and said, look, let it take its course.
[02:46:12.244 --> 02:46:13.284]  And it did.
[02:46:13.284 --> 02:46:15.645]  And we were out of the recession in a year.
[02:46:16.178 --> 02:46:19.139]  And it boomed during the 20s, of course, too much.
[02:46:19.139 --> 02:46:22.020]  And then, of course, the Fed pulled the plug again.
[02:46:22.020 --> 02:46:23.420]  And this is all rigged.
[02:46:23.420 --> 02:46:32.963]  It's all contrived to make gazillions of dollars for these people and ensconce them greater, greater, greater power.
[02:46:32.963 --> 02:46:39.525]  But they've clearly overplayed their hand this time because resistance to them is just mounting.
[02:46:39.525 --> 02:46:42.265]  Well, that's why we've got to keep on hammering on.
[02:46:42.265 --> 02:46:44.806]  And that's like with you, yourself, and myself.
[02:46:45.687 --> 02:46:49.608]  We went, you know, hammer and tong after that climate gate.
[02:46:49.608 --> 02:46:51.329]  And it was a tremendous issue.
[02:46:51.329 --> 02:46:59.211]  I mean, I'm getting on stations I would have never got on before Foxcom emailed me and asked me to go on.
[02:46:59.211 --> 02:47:07.573]  We had Rush and O'Reilly use tapes of mine from the shows that I've been on on the air.
[02:47:07.573 --> 02:47:11.594]  I mean, they're trying to capture the flavor of the thing so they can
[02:47:12.222 --> 02:47:15.404]  Continue to get their ratings, and the ratings aren't there for them.
[02:47:15.404 --> 02:47:17.365]  They're falling off in their ratings.
[02:47:17.365 --> 02:47:18.725]  And that's why they're doing that.
[02:47:18.725 --> 02:47:22.047]  And Alex, you pointed that out before.
[02:47:22.047 --> 02:47:23.248]  Well, absolutely.
[02:47:23.248 --> 02:47:41.657]  The founder of the Tea Parties, the guy that actually started it to be non-partisan, anti-Federal Reserve, he went on Fox, of all places, and said, Glenn Beck and the fake Republicans have hijacked our movement, and so... And then Jesse Ventura's new TV show gets the highest ratings true TV's ever had.
[02:47:43.567 --> 02:47:45.468]  And it should.
[02:47:45.468 --> 02:47:47.289]  All Jesse's doing is saying, hey, look at this.
[02:47:47.289 --> 02:47:48.309]  This is the truth.
[02:47:48.309 --> 02:47:49.670]  This is the way it is.
[02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:52.071]  And this is all the people want.
[02:47:52.071 --> 02:47:57.034]  Tell us the truth and which direction we should go.
[02:47:57.034 --> 02:48:01.436]  Well, folks, there are some positive things happening, but we're not out of the woods yet, as they say.
[02:48:01.436 --> 02:48:05.878]  The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but we've got miles to go before we sleep.
[02:48:07.492 --> 02:48:09.432]  In fact, somebody pull up that poem for me.
[02:48:09.432 --> 02:48:12.353]  The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have miles to go before I sleep.
[02:48:12.353 --> 02:48:14.634]  I want to read that poem later.
[02:48:14.634 --> 02:48:15.834]  Bob, I want to take some calls.
[02:48:15.834 --> 02:48:19.175]  They're all over the map from earlier, but you can comment on any issue.
[02:48:19.175 --> 02:48:20.815]  Let's talk to Jake in California.
[02:48:20.815 --> 02:48:21.615]  Jake, you're on the air.
[02:48:21.615 --> 02:48:24.036]  Hey, man.
[02:48:24.036 --> 02:48:26.116]  I'm enjoying the program this morning.
[02:48:26.116 --> 02:48:28.237]  I just wanted to say hi.
[02:48:28.237 --> 02:48:32.598]  I've got a friend in northern Mississippi that listens to you regularly, Susie Q. Anyhow,
[02:48:34.415 --> 02:48:41.160]  Um, let me just say, uh, first of all, I wanted to make a comment on what you guys just said regarding the economy, but Alex, I'd like to make a request.
[02:48:41.160 --> 02:48:46.543]  Would you please have Dr. Deagle on sometime in the near future to discuss?
[02:48:46.543 --> 02:48:48.084]  You got to make your point, sir.
[02:48:48.084 --> 02:48:49.825]  I go ahead and make your point.
[02:48:49.825 --> 02:48:50.125]  Okay.
[02:48:50.125 --> 02:48:56.229]  Well, the point I wanted to make is I completely disagree with what you guys just said that we're going to get this country back.
[02:48:56.229 --> 02:48:58.251]  Literally, that would take a miracle.
[02:48:58.251 --> 02:48:59.331]  That's not going to be us.
[02:48:59.331 --> 02:49:00.472]  It's going to be a miracle.
[02:49:00.472 --> 02:49:01.973]  There is a course that's been set.
[02:49:02.583 --> 02:49:05.605]  You actually have been a proponent of that.
[02:49:05.605 --> 02:49:07.447]  You've been speaking about it.
[02:49:07.447 --> 02:49:10.629]  And so we don't just have some miraculous turnaround.
[02:49:10.629 --> 02:49:10.890]  Wow.
[02:49:10.890 --> 02:49:14.172]  I mean, this is a really defeatist phone call here, Jack.
[02:49:14.172 --> 02:49:17.715]  No, it's not a defeatist phone call.
[02:49:17.715 --> 02:49:19.777]  What it is, is it's a realistic phone call.
[02:49:19.777 --> 02:49:24.581]  A lot of it is based on the data that you've passed in the past.
[02:49:24.581 --> 02:49:29.945]  So, I mean, when you pass data to us and tell us that, you know, basically,
[02:49:30.615 --> 02:49:32.920]  We're in an enormous amount of trouble, which is true.
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:34.183]  We can see that.
[02:49:34.183 --> 02:49:37.511]  And then in the next breath to say we're going to win this thing, we're not.
[02:49:38.926 --> 02:49:42.468]  Listen, listen, you've got the wrong show then, bro.
[02:49:42.468 --> 02:49:44.129]  You've got the wrong radio show.
[02:49:44.129 --> 02:49:48.030]  Since we're not going to beat anything, go out and party and have a great time.
[02:49:48.030 --> 02:49:49.691]  You've got the wrong show.
[02:49:49.691 --> 02:49:52.833]  The climate gate is devastating and Copenhagen is going to fail.
[02:49:52.833 --> 02:49:55.594]  They're still going to try to implement all this at the grassroots level.
[02:49:55.594 --> 02:50:03.677]  We've got to go out with a winning attitude and engage these people at the local level and take our communities back by standing up against them.
[02:50:03.677 --> 02:50:04.498]  The Federal Reserve.
[02:50:05.765 --> 02:50:08.687]  We just pointed out all the stuff they're going to try to pull on us.
[02:50:08.687 --> 02:50:13.311]  But the beginning of the end is happening for them.
[02:50:13.311 --> 02:50:19.676]  And, I mean, I just don't even know what to say where I'm bad for saying we can win this thing.
[02:50:20.615 --> 02:50:21.556]  This is a process.
[02:50:21.556 --> 02:50:24.858]  It's not going to happen overnight, but we have to reach out to people.
[02:50:24.858 --> 02:50:27.039]  We've got to get involved.
[02:50:27.039 --> 02:50:33.183]  And I know history, and I know the situation we're facing, and I know we've got a chance to reverse this.
[02:50:33.183 --> 02:50:35.944]  Bob, I want to get your take on that call when we come back.
[02:50:41.462 --> 02:50:48.365]  People don't understand what attitude is about, and initiative, and knowing we're in the right, and standing up and saying we're gonna win.
[02:50:48.365 --> 02:50:50.286]  They don't understand warfare.
[02:50:50.286 --> 02:50:51.846]  They don't understand info war.
[02:50:51.846 --> 02:50:53.727]  They don't understand we've got the truth.
[02:50:53.727 --> 02:50:55.508]  We've got the ultimate weapon on our side.
[02:50:55.508 --> 02:50:58.949]  They don't understand that the enemy is imploding at every level.
[02:50:58.949 --> 02:50:59.990]  Man, that makes me sick!
[02:51:01.877 --> 02:51:06.478]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[02:52:02.489 --> 02:52:06.518]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.518 --> 02:52:09.765]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.765 --> 02:52:11.167]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:11.869 --> 02:52:14.551]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.551 --> 02:52:20.935]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.935 --> 02:52:26.119]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.119 --> 02:52:36.126]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.226 --> 02:52:38.567]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.567 --> 02:52:40.168]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.168 --> 02:52:42.629]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.629 --> 02:52:44.750]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.750 --> 02:52:49.893]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.893 --> 02:52:59.017]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:53:19.248 --> 02:53:22.329]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.

[02:54:07.110 --> 02:54:13.575]  Look, I'm going to get Bob's take on what we just heard, but first I just want to say this.
[02:54:13.575 --> 02:54:30.828]  We have gotten into this position where we've been taken over and usurped by foreign offshore banks and corporations because we got an attitude that we're the biggest, we're the best, there's no corruption in government, I could just go play golf all day and never care about who's getting elected or never care about what's happening with special interest.
[02:54:30.828 --> 02:54:31.748]  I can just go to sleep.
[02:54:32.629 --> 02:54:35.751]  And I know that if we have that attitude, things are only going to get worse.
[02:54:35.751 --> 02:54:38.412]  We are having successes that are so giant.
[02:54:38.412 --> 02:54:43.234]  The spirit in this country and the world is shifting and awakening.
[02:54:43.234 --> 02:54:45.055]  I'm seeing it.
[02:54:45.055 --> 02:54:53.159]  Everywhere I go, in foreign countries and other cities, masses of people come up to Alex Jones on the street and say, we're awake, we're fighting.
[02:54:53.159 --> 02:54:54.119]  And I'm just one guy.
[02:54:54.119 --> 02:55:01.323]  So you may not have a face they recognize, the caller from California, Dave, and so you may think,
[02:55:02.023 --> 02:55:10.014]  That you know that I'm blowing smoke and you may see decadent soulless people around you who aren't awake and think we're doomed.
[02:55:10.014 --> 02:55:15.201]  I know we're in a lot better position than we were a year ago, two years ago, ten years ago.
[02:55:15.201 --> 02:55:17.103]  Bob Chapman's been doing this for almost 50 years.
[02:55:18.405 --> 02:55:22.446]  Okay, he's an icon in fighting the New World Order and he doesn't have a loser attitude.
[02:55:22.446 --> 02:55:30.549]  And I'm not calling you a loser, sir, but I don't need to be rebuked for getting up here and saying, things are really bad, these people are really bad.
[02:55:30.549 --> 02:55:33.750]  That's like if your house is on fire and I go call the fire department, it's on fire.
[02:55:33.750 --> 02:55:36.131]  I'm not being negative, I'm telling you the truth.
[02:55:36.131 --> 02:55:42.313]  But the fire department pulled up, they put out fires in a couple rooms, looks like we're going to be able to save the house.
[02:55:42.313 --> 02:55:45.474]  If you'll stop telling the firemen to stand down.
[02:55:47.981 --> 02:55:49.722]  They told the Founding Fathers they couldn't win.
[02:55:49.722 --> 02:55:51.544]  They've told everybody they couldn't win.
[02:55:51.544 --> 02:55:53.905]  They've told inventors they couldn't invent things.
[02:55:53.905 --> 02:56:01.231]  It is an attitude, a loser attitude, that we have going on here that we've got to rout out.
[02:56:01.231 --> 02:56:03.813]  We have to go look at these criminals in government,
[02:56:04.133 --> 02:56:13.163]  Beat the drum that they're criminals, expose their system, and they will fall because they've triggered criminal operations that are going to hurt people financially.
[02:56:13.163 --> 02:56:19.849]  And so even lazy, decadent people are now looking for the truth and rubbing the sleep out of their eyes and getting awake and getting involved.
[02:56:20.430 --> 02:56:23.151]  I agree, but I think it's good to have the dialogue and have the other
[02:56:45.245 --> 02:56:48.527]  Like the gentleman said, I don't believe it.
[02:56:48.527 --> 02:56:50.167]  I don't think it's going to work.
[02:56:50.167 --> 02:56:51.468]  He understands the problem.
[02:56:51.468 --> 02:56:53.029]  He said he did.
[02:56:53.029 --> 02:56:56.130]  And his take, you said, is incorrect.
[02:56:56.130 --> 02:56:58.451]  I agree with you.
[02:56:58.451 --> 02:57:00.071]  And it is incorrect.
[02:57:00.071 --> 02:57:11.876]  And the key word, and you mentioned it just a minute or two ago, is we know what the problem is and we have to have the spirit of American citizens and our country
[02:57:12.614 --> 02:57:15.596]  And we have to go forward and stop these people.
[02:57:15.596 --> 02:57:31.425]  And better we should go forward and be defeated than not go forward at all and just give up and give these people world government and world tyranny and we become vassals of some vast state.
[02:57:31.425 --> 02:57:34.887]  We've got to stop them here and we've got to make sure they don't do it again.
[02:57:34.887 --> 02:57:36.607]  And that's spirit.
[02:57:36.607 --> 02:57:39.149]  It's just like a sports team goes out, they're going to have
[02:57:39.654 --> 02:57:53.636]  Interaction with another team, no matter what the sport, and you all talk together and say, look, we know these other guys or these other gals are really good, but we get the spirit and we really want to win this game and we're going to do it.
[02:57:55.197 --> 02:58:00.140]  And then you look at the fact that the globalists are a bunch of pot-bellied, wicked, corrupt people.
[02:58:00.140 --> 02:58:03.062]  Sure, they've got the money and the power, but it's all fraudulent.
[02:58:03.062 --> 02:58:21.332]  If you really look at the strength of the people, we're like a million feet tall, weigh six trillion pounds, and they're a 125-pound pot-bellied goblin that's gotten up there full of arrogance and chutzpah or whatever and beat its chest and told us we're beaten, told us that we can't win.
[02:58:22.512 --> 02:58:31.175]  I mean, when they were dropping A-bombs on Tokyo or on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Imperial Japanese were broadcasting, we'd lost the war.
[02:58:31.175 --> 02:58:34.856]  It's like Baghdad Bob getting up there and saying that the U.S.
[02:58:34.856 --> 02:58:37.857]  had lost as explosions were going off behind him.
[02:58:37.857 --> 02:58:39.357]  It's a crock of baloney.
[02:58:39.357 --> 02:58:43.178]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:43.178 --> 02:58:46.979]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.979 --> 02:58:48.620]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.701 --> 02:58:54.722]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.722 --> 02:59:00.045]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:59:00.045 --> 02:59:02.105]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:02.105 --> 02:59:07.108]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:07.108 --> 02:59:08.288]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.288 --> 02:59:09.409]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.409 --> 02:59:11.289]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.289 --> 02:59:12.370]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.370 --> 02:59:14.571]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.571 --> 02:59:15.911]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.911 --> 02:59:17.212]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.432 --> 02:59:22.698]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.698 --> 02:59:26.283]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.283 --> 02:59:30.107]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:30.107 --> 02:59:31.328]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.328 --> 02:59:32.229]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.229 --> 02:59:33.331]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.331 --> 02:59:34.272]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.272 --> 02:59:35.093]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.353 --> 02:59:38.395]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.395 --> 02:59:40.597]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.597 --> 02:59:41.618]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.618 --> 02:59:42.819]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.819 --> 02:59:44.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:08.354 --> 03:00:12.758]  Stopping by the woods on a snowy evening, Robert Frost.
[03:00:12.758 --> 03:00:15.120]  Whose woods these are I think I know.
[03:00:15.120 --> 03:00:18.062]  His house is in the village though.
[03:00:18.062 --> 03:00:23.486]  He will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow.
[03:00:23.486 --> 03:00:28.510]  My little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near.
[03:00:28.510 --> 03:00:31.033]  Between the woods and frozen lake,
[03:00:31.741 --> 03:00:34.483]  The darkest evening of the year.
[03:00:34.483 --> 03:00:41.007]  He gives his little harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake.
[03:00:41.007 --> 03:00:48.112]  The only other sounds the sweep of easy wind and downy flake.
[03:00:48.112 --> 03:00:57.778]  The woods are lovely dark and deep but I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep and miles to go before I sleep.
[03:01:00.632 --> 03:01:03.135]  Nice little wintertime poem.
[03:01:03.135 --> 03:01:07.160]  I wish I was in the woods riding a horse, but I gotta be right here fighting the New World Order!
[03:01:10.418 --> 03:01:30.829]  You know, if people would just go to their city councils, their county commissioners, their state houses, confront them, speak out, go to public events, call into talk radio, call Congress, go and confront the land grabbers, go and confront the CPS, stand up for your rights, demonstrate, rally so they can't ban it, go to public events, confront globalists.
[03:01:30.829 --> 03:01:39.254]  I mean, Al Gore is canceling much of his speaking tours because everywhere he goes he's being protested, and that's making it in the newspaper, and he looks bad.
[03:01:39.674 --> 03:01:41.755]  These people don't have total control.
[03:01:41.755 --> 03:01:57.664]  So many people that serve the system, serve it because they think we're kooks, because they were told we were kooks by the media, but now because of people 20, 30, 40 years ago telling the truth, everybody heard the truth, so now that it's been proven to be the truth, people are ready to wake up.
[03:01:58.044 --> 03:02:02.445]  What is it that that caller can't understand about that, Bob?
[03:02:02.445 --> 03:02:06.306]  He isn't rejoicing at all the successes we're having.
[03:02:06.306 --> 03:02:10.347]  He isn't rejoicing at the enemy in retreat on multi-fronts.
[03:02:10.347 --> 03:02:12.127]  Every time we fight, we win.
[03:02:12.127 --> 03:02:16.548]  But how do we get the people to stand up, Bob?
[03:02:16.548 --> 03:02:23.330]  By telling them the truth and continuing to cite all of the instances that you brought up today about
[03:02:24.306 --> 03:02:39.074]  Cap and Trade and the scandal in Climategate and the power of what's going on in Congress with the Fed Reserve and the eminent passage of Ron Paul's 1207 and the 604 in the Senate.
[03:02:39.074 --> 03:02:40.875]  All these are very positive things.
[03:02:40.875 --> 03:02:47.159]  We're showing people that all the things that they suspected are really going on.
[03:02:47.159 --> 03:02:51.521]  And the reason we couldn't find out is everything is behind closed doors.
[03:02:52.113 --> 03:02:57.057]  You know, Alex, you and I, we back into a lot of things.
[03:02:57.057 --> 03:02:59.999]  Because we can't get the information sometimes.
[03:02:59.999 --> 03:03:06.284]  And you put the puzzle together, and all of a sudden you've discovered, well, that's what they're doing.
[03:03:06.284 --> 03:03:08.486]  And most people don't want to bother to do that.
[03:03:08.486 --> 03:03:13.229]  They'd rather throw their hands in the air and live in an internment camp.
[03:03:13.229 --> 03:03:15.351]  And evidently that's what that fellow would like to do.
[03:03:15.891 --> 03:03:20.955]  And on top of that, we're going to come back and take calls, I promise, for John, Alan, Mike, Scott, and others.
[03:03:20.955 --> 03:03:22.737]  We get internal congressional reports.
[03:03:22.737 --> 03:03:24.898]  We get internal ADL reports.
[03:03:24.898 --> 03:03:28.561]  We get internal reports from the big think tanks.
[03:03:28.561 --> 03:03:31.544]  And look at all these emails from the top UN climate fraudsters.
[03:03:31.544 --> 03:03:34.326]  They're pulling their hair out, going, they're exposing us!
[03:03:34.326 --> 03:03:35.387]  How do we stop them?
[03:03:35.387 --> 03:03:36.468]  They may beat us!
[03:03:36.468 --> 03:03:39.630]  They're behind the scenes, they're just, they're everywhere!
[03:03:39.630 --> 03:03:40.511]  They're waking up to us!
[03:03:41.051 --> 03:03:47.374]  Out in the public, they're like, we're winning, everything's fine, because they understand they've got to put that good face on their fraud.
[03:03:47.374 --> 03:03:50.956]  But when we come out and say we're starting to win, that's real!
[03:03:50.956 --> 03:03:59.200]  Folks, they're scared to death of us!
[03:03:59.200 --> 03:03:59.320]  Bob?
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:00.780]  And that's a fact.
[03:04:00.780 --> 03:04:02.261]  And that's a fact.
[03:04:02.261 --> 03:04:03.722]  I am just... It is, it is.
[03:04:03.722 --> 03:04:04.822]  I know these people.
[03:04:04.822 --> 03:04:06.643]  I've debated them just like you have.
[03:04:07.418 --> 03:04:12.202]  And they don't want to talk about anything on the plane that we want to talk about.
[03:04:12.202 --> 03:04:13.683]  There's no open discussion.
[03:04:13.683 --> 03:04:21.429]  I mean, Ron Paul, for the first time in the last couple of weeks, got on major television, CNBC and things like that.
[03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:34.959]  They're now recognizing that the feeling of disenchantment by the public is so great that they have to use more propaganda and face up to the fact that there is opposition, just like the gentleman that called in.
[03:04:36.122 --> 03:04:40.386]  He's in opposition to trying to win, evidently.
[03:04:40.386 --> 03:04:44.229]  And these people, they want to hold on to what they've got.
[03:04:44.229 --> 03:04:57.220]  This power, this enormous amount of money, the control, the... Well, Bob, there's also a lot of people that expect we're going to lose and can't believe anything ever positive is going to happen.
[03:04:57.220 --> 03:05:00.163]  But the globalists are just criminals, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:05:01.024 --> 03:05:06.331]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:05:06.331 --> 03:05:10.857]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:05:10.857 --> 03:05:13.140]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:05:13.140 --> 03:05:14.762]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:05:14.762 --> 03:05:15.804]  There is a solution.
[03:05:16.024 --> 03:05:24.452]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:07.915]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:06:07.915 --> 03:06:09.196]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:06:09.196 --> 03:06:10.017]  It's very real.
[03:06:10.017 --> 03:06:12.258]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:06:12.258 --> 03:06:13.920]  And it's available right now to you.

[03:07:00.689 --> 03:07:05.233]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:07:05.233 --> 03:07:06.154]  Number one.
[03:07:06.154 --> 03:07:09.577]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:07:09.577 --> 03:07:10.438]  Number two.
[03:07:10.438 --> 03:07:15.323]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:07:15.323 --> 03:07:16.084]  It's true.
[03:07:16.084 --> 03:07:20.628]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:07:20.928 --> 03:07:21.749]  Number 3.
[03:07:21.749 --> 03:07:25.332]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:07:25.332 --> 03:07:29.256]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:07:29.256 --> 03:07:30.056]  Number 4.
[03:07:30.056 --> 03:07:32.819]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:07:32.819 --> 03:07:36.502]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:07:36.502 --> 03:07:37.283]  Number 5.
[03:07:37.283 --> 03:07:41.447]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:07:41.447 --> 03:07:46.211]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:07:46.471 --> 03:07:50.654]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:50.654 --> 03:07:52.435]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:52.435 --> 03:07:54.696]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:07:54.696 --> 03:07:57.298]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:07:57.298 --> 03:08:06.884]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.884 --> 03:08:09.245]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:09.245 --> 03:08:14.569]  Alright, going back to your calls, my final point on the
[03:08:15.925 --> 03:08:18.426]  Loser spirit that some people still have out there.
[03:08:18.426 --> 03:08:21.507]  The sense of defeatism.
[03:08:21.507 --> 03:08:23.528]  The globalists are slick criminals.
[03:08:23.528 --> 03:08:36.574]  And they're good at feeding on people that don't have a lot of information, people that are lazy, people that are weak, people that go along to get along, people that buy into slick corporate hype.
[03:08:36.574 --> 03:08:43.776]  But the globalists are threatened by strong, focused men and women that know the truth and will warn the people.
[03:08:43.776 --> 03:08:44.297]  And now,
[03:08:45.521 --> 03:08:47.341]  Every time we stand up, we win.
[03:08:47.341 --> 03:08:49.802]  The problem is we can't get people to stand up.
[03:08:49.802 --> 03:08:51.402]  People don't see themselves as leaders.
[03:08:51.402 --> 03:08:55.323]  I get thousands of emails every month saying, oh, we're glad you're there doing the job.
[03:08:55.323 --> 03:08:58.863]  No, folks, I'm just one person in this fight.
[03:08:58.863 --> 03:09:05.385]  That's what's so beautiful about We Are Change and the Tea Parties and other groups that are out confronting Gore and all these other globalists everywhere they go.
[03:09:05.385 --> 03:09:07.705]  People should be confronting Schwarzenegger everywhere he goes.
[03:09:07.705 --> 03:09:12.666]  They should be confronting all these other climate change fraudsters like Newt Gingrich.
[03:09:13.829 --> 03:09:22.660]  It's on both parties and the left-right paradigm where they divide us into two parties and make us fight with each other and make us think the power structure ends with the president.
[03:09:22.660 --> 03:09:25.865]  That mirage is coming crashing down right now.
[03:09:25.865 --> 03:09:28.848]  So the media plays up these gate crashers for a week and a half.
[03:09:29.389 --> 03:09:29.669]  Hi Alex.
[03:09:29.669 --> 03:09:29.789]  Bob?
[03:09:29.789 --> 03:09:30.069]  Yes sir.
[03:09:59.759 --> 03:10:03.300]  One time I think he said that you knew Leon Degrell?
[03:10:03.300 --> 03:10:04.820]  Very well.
[03:10:04.820 --> 03:10:06.440]  Could you explain a little bit about him?
[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:10.161]  I read his book, Campaign in Russia, and the guy was really a brave soldier, really.
[03:10:10.161 --> 03:10:13.002]  It's really an excellent book on the Eastern Front.
[03:10:13.002 --> 03:10:16.542]  I guess he said he told you a few things about World War II history and post-war Europe.
[03:10:16.542 --> 03:10:19.383]  I wonder if you could elaborate a bit on that?
[03:10:19.383 --> 03:10:27.545]  Well, I don't think this is the right time to do it, but Leon was a very well-read gentleman.
[03:10:27.545 --> 03:10:28.665]  He was an attorney.
[03:10:29.369 --> 03:10:32.732]  He was the head of the Rexus Party in Belgium.
[03:10:32.732 --> 03:10:34.493]  He was a reporter.
[03:10:34.493 --> 03:10:39.717]  He was an eloquent speaker, although he never learned English.
[03:10:39.717 --> 03:10:44.200]  And we always had to converse in French or in German.
[03:10:44.200 --> 03:10:53.487]  And his exploits during the Second World War as a soldier were second to none in any army.
[03:10:53.487 --> 03:10:58.791]  And he was a survivor, and he was a very nice man.
[03:11:00.583 --> 03:11:03.544]  All right, thanks a lot, Bob.
[03:11:03.544 --> 03:11:07.006]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Allen in Kentucky.
[03:11:07.006 --> 03:11:07.886]  Allen, you're on the air.
[03:11:07.886 --> 03:11:09.527]  Go ahead.
[03:11:09.527 --> 03:11:14.750]  Gentlemen, thank you very much for opening my eyes to so much.
[03:11:14.750 --> 03:11:20.773]  And I have so much anger at these people because I've had a very good life.
[03:11:20.773 --> 03:11:25.755]  I'm in my 60s, and I appreciate everything that this country has done and given to me.
[03:11:26.451 --> 03:11:32.973]  But I'm afraid that my children and my grandchildren are not going to have it as well as I did.
[03:11:32.973 --> 03:11:37.794]  So I'm one of these old fighters in this info war, Alex.
[03:11:37.794 --> 03:11:39.554]  I've bought many of your movies.
[03:11:39.554 --> 03:11:41.535]  I've made copies of them.
[03:11:41.535 --> 03:11:48.016]  And I want to tell those people out there who have this defeatist attitude, it's not going to happen.
[03:11:48.016 --> 03:11:51.157]  Things are going to probably get tougher than they are.
[03:11:51.157 --> 03:11:54.638]  I'm a little bit afraid now that as we push
[03:11:55.205 --> 03:12:03.148]  The New World Order into a corner, and I think we have pushed them into a corner, that they are going to become more desperate.
[03:12:03.148 --> 03:12:04.768]  But at least it's on our terms.
[03:12:04.768 --> 03:12:17.272]  How many years have I explained that when they announce their plan, there'd be a huge awakening, and it's not going to be all roses for these people, but at least we don't just lay here and let them carry it out the way they want.
[03:12:17.272 --> 03:12:18.873]  We make them escalate.
[03:12:18.873 --> 03:12:20.213]  We make them fight.
[03:12:20.213 --> 03:12:21.734]  We make them come out in the open.
[03:12:23.866 --> 03:12:34.053]  And because of you, Alex, we know their game plan, we know what they have in their repertoire, we know what the possibilities are, and we can prepare for that.
[03:12:34.053 --> 03:12:38.677]  And I do have one question that I'd like to get Bob's take on, if I may.
[03:12:38.677 --> 03:12:40.998]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:12:40.998 --> 03:12:52.707]  And all my life, I've paid my taxes, and I've never cheated on my taxes, and yet I'm feeling very conflicted about that right now, since I know exactly where that money is going.
[03:12:53.303 --> 03:12:57.364]  And I think a lot of Americans are coming to that same conclusion.
[03:12:57.364 --> 03:13:01.104]  And I'm not advocating this to anybody.
[03:13:01.104 --> 03:13:10.946]  No, but record numbers are not paying now because they know, as Ronald Reagan's commission showed in 1981, not one red cent of your income tax money goes to run the country.
[03:13:10.946 --> 03:13:12.567]  It all goes to the private banks.
[03:13:12.567 --> 03:13:13.487]  Go ahead.
[03:13:13.487 --> 03:13:19.708]  What would happen if a large number of us came to that same conclusion?
[03:13:19.708 --> 03:13:20.628]  That's what I'd like to know.
[03:13:23.203 --> 03:13:31.712]  I think historically, about 32% of people who own their own small businesses do not file at all.
[03:13:31.712 --> 03:13:35.916]  And that figure, I understand, has now risen to 38%.
[03:13:35.916 --> 03:13:40.000]  And if this thing keeps on going the way it's going, it's probably going to go up to 60 or 70%.
[03:13:42.820 --> 03:13:47.644]  And these people aren't captive because they own their own businesses.
[03:13:47.644 --> 03:13:53.769]  But there is a groundswell of people who are saying, no, I'm not going to do that anymore.
[03:13:53.769 --> 03:13:55.231]  And I'm not going to pay them.
[03:13:55.231 --> 03:13:56.892]  And there's millions of us.
[03:13:56.892 --> 03:14:03.538]  And so if I get caught and I have to go up against the government, well, I'm willing to do that.
[03:14:03.538 --> 03:14:04.659]  And that's what's happening.
[03:14:04.659 --> 03:14:08.562]  And I can understand why you're questioning what's going on.
[03:14:08.562 --> 03:14:09.923]  And it's a good time to do it.
[03:14:10.620 --> 03:14:15.405]  I mean, the people who work in companies, they don't have that luxury.
[03:14:15.405 --> 03:14:19.049]  They receive a paycheck and they take everything out and then they give you what's left.
[03:14:20.033 --> 03:14:24.514]  But private individuals who have their own companies, they're in a different situation.
[03:14:24.514 --> 03:14:25.574]  Yeah, I appreciate your call.
[03:14:25.574 --> 03:14:26.634]  Let me make this point.
[03:14:26.634 --> 03:14:28.535]  That's your decision to make.
[03:14:28.535 --> 03:14:32.096]  People are going, well, how do they fund the government if it isn't the income tax?
[03:14:32.096 --> 03:14:33.596]  It's all the hundreds of other taxes.
[03:14:33.596 --> 03:14:43.818]  And when you read what the UN says, and you read what the federal government has stated, they want a global carbon tax system that's going to be on an ID card with your carbon credits.
[03:14:44.338 --> 03:15:11.370]  And when those run out, more taxes will kick in, not just taxes on each item that's passed on to the manufacturing process or through transportation and at all the other points of all these taxes that are added, but they want it so they can track what you're buying, what you're doing, and the system under Homeland Security, and they've stated this, will be, you won't have a job, you won't get on a plane, you won't buy a gun, you won't be able to buy anything unless you're in good terms with the federal government.
[03:15:11.370 --> 03:15:12.631]  That's what the
[03:15:13.391 --> 03:15:16.294]  New World Order, cashless society is all about.
[03:15:16.294 --> 03:15:18.657]  So they're racing to put that in place.
[03:15:18.657 --> 03:15:26.124]  We have to really stand up against them now and slow them down because once their cashless control grid's in place, it's going to be a lot harder.
[03:15:26.124 --> 03:15:26.645]  Correct, Bob?
[03:15:27.854 --> 03:15:29.014]  Absolutely.
[03:15:29.014 --> 03:15:32.816]  And this is part of world government, and that's what they're headed for.
[03:15:32.816 --> 03:15:36.037]  And all the defeatists out there are willing to accept that.
[03:15:36.037 --> 03:15:43.200]  Well, Alex and I are not, and you aren't, and most of the audience isn't, and that's what we're going to continue to do.
[03:15:43.200 --> 03:15:44.640]  We're going to go after them.
[03:15:44.640 --> 03:15:46.841]  We won't wait for them to come to us.
[03:15:46.841 --> 03:15:50.282]  We're going to engage them, and we're going to attack them.
[03:15:50.282 --> 03:15:51.483]  And you know something?
[03:15:51.483 --> 03:15:52.343]  We're going to conquer them.
[03:15:54.707 --> 03:15:59.369]  Let's go, because see, once the system is fully discredited, they stage terror attacks, it won't work.
[03:15:59.369 --> 03:16:01.410]  They start new wars, it won't work.
[03:16:01.410 --> 03:16:08.493]  I mean, they're getting so discredited that when they attack myself and others now, people go, oh, Alex must be good, they're attacking him.
[03:16:08.493 --> 03:16:13.255]  I mean, there's a certain point where people don't buy anything they say or do.
[03:16:13.255 --> 03:16:14.815]  Let's talk to Allen in Kentucky.
[03:16:14.815 --> 03:16:16.096]  Allen, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[03:16:16.096 --> 03:16:20.558]  Go ahead.
[03:16:20.558 --> 03:16:21.658]  I'm sorry, I doubled that.
[03:16:21.658 --> 03:16:22.459]  Mike in New York.
[03:16:22.459 --> 03:16:22.999]  Mike, go ahead.
[03:16:23.917 --> 03:16:27.741]  Oh, how are you doing, Alex and Bob?
[03:16:27.741 --> 03:16:28.161]  Excuse me.
[03:16:28.161 --> 03:16:34.367]  Yeah, I've been listening and I heard that caller and, you know, I'm not going to give up.
[03:16:34.367 --> 03:16:35.147]  I'm going to go out.
[03:16:35.147 --> 03:16:37.149]  I'm going to do what I can, too.
[03:16:37.149 --> 03:16:45.777]  And, you know, if it means handing out DVDs to people, which is what I've been doing, then I'm going to do it.
[03:16:45.777 --> 03:16:47.479]  I'm going to do whatever I can to help.
[03:16:48.504 --> 03:17:09.180]  Wake some people up, and it has been, you know, I have been having, you know, in effect, people have been seeing the DVDs, and they see what's going on now, clearly, and a lot of people, they've been making copies, and handed it out to friends, and people that they know, and that's the way you do it.
[03:17:09.180 --> 03:17:14.725]  I mean, you have to do something, and, you know, if that's one effective way to do it,
[03:17:17.008 --> 03:17:18.008]  Then let's do it, right?
[03:17:35.561 --> 03:17:44.789]  It only takes one dose of a fall the republic or Obama deception or America freedom to fascism for somebody to really wake up.
[03:17:44.789 --> 03:17:49.854]  It only takes one dose and that's why they're punishing people.
[03:17:49.854 --> 03:17:53.437]  There's an article up at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[03:17:53.437 --> 03:18:00.183]  America freedom to fascism star Sherry Jackson, IRS agent, is being murdered in prison right now and we've got her letter.
[03:18:00.843 --> 03:18:04.505]  About how they're killing her and not giving her a medication.
[03:18:04.505 --> 03:18:13.911]  They want to let other federal agents know that if they come out and admit that internally the IRS knows they work for the private Federal Reserve, they know of their own people.
[03:18:13.911 --> 03:18:21.736]  You know, there's a famous photo that my parents brought back to me from East Germany after it fell, but it's a famous photo of right after they closed the wall.
[03:18:22.765 --> 03:18:34.848]  Back in the 50s, of a little toddler, his parents had gone through, he got caught in the wire, and an East German soldier comes over, untangles him, the parents are begging, and he gives the child to them.
[03:18:34.848 --> 03:18:38.649]  They took that guy and tortured him to death, but he saved a child.
[03:18:38.649 --> 03:18:39.869]  He's a real man.
[03:18:39.869 --> 03:18:42.970]  And that photo is very famous in Germany today.
[03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:48.013]  And so, just like they're torturing her to death, they tortured him to death.
[03:18:48.013 --> 03:18:52.177]  And because they want to punish their Nazi forces.
[03:18:52.177 --> 03:18:59.162]  When one of their forces does the right thing, they want to throw him in the deepest dungeon or kill him.
[03:18:59.162 --> 03:19:00.043]  Everybody needs to call.
[03:19:00.043 --> 03:19:01.524]  We have the phone numbers up there.
[03:19:01.524 --> 03:19:04.406]  And let these criminals know that we know they're murdering her.
[03:19:04.406 --> 03:19:06.287]  Bob Chapman.
[03:19:06.287 --> 03:19:10.130]  I'm running that letter tomorrow in the International Forecaster.
[03:19:10.130 --> 03:19:12.252]  And I received it like you did.
[03:19:13.047 --> 03:19:25.195]  And I think it's tragic, and there's so many people you never hear about that get thrown into prison for victimless crimes, we'll call them.
[03:19:25.195 --> 03:19:31.959]  Alan Stang, you know, who just died recently, he was thrown in prison because he fought the tax system.
[03:19:32.751 --> 03:19:34.652]  And, of course, you know what the outcome was.
[03:19:34.652 --> 03:19:42.034]  The court doesn't listen, and the judges do what they're told to do, and off Alan went for a couple of years in prison.
[03:19:42.034 --> 03:19:45.515]  And so this is what they do when they get you there.
[03:19:45.515 --> 03:19:49.756]  Alan told me that when he was in there, they did everything possible to... Stay there, Bob.
[03:19:49.756 --> 03:19:50.757]  Let's do one more segment.
[03:19:50.757 --> 03:19:52.457]  I want you to finish that story.
[03:19:52.457 --> 03:19:54.958]  These are real heroes, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:19:54.958 --> 03:19:57.459]  This is what we're up against, but we're winning.
[03:19:57.459 --> 03:19:58.019]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.949 --> 03:20:08.931]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:20:08.931 --> 03:20:10.191]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:20:10.191 --> 03:20:11.011]  It's very real.
[03:20:11.011 --> 03:20:14.913]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[03:20:14.913 --> 03:20:19.374]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:20:19.374 --> 03:20:21.954]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[03:20:21.954 --> 03:20:27.736]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[03:20:27.756 --> 03:20:27.956]  Yes.
[03:20:27.956 --> 03:20:32.740]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[03:20:32.740 --> 03:20:35.583]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:20:35.583 --> 03:20:38.305]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:20:38.305 --> 03:20:45.772]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[03:20:45.772 --> 03:20:49.515]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[03:20:49.515 --> 03:20:49.715]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[03:21:01.747 --> 03:21:05.851]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[03:21:05.851 --> 03:21:10.115]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[03:21:10.115 --> 03:21:11.696]  You get less for your money.
[03:21:11.696 --> 03:21:17.542]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[03:21:20.094 --> 03:21:20.514]  We're good.
[03:21:43.746 --> 03:21:46.528]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:46.528 --> 03:21:48.209]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:48.209 --> 03:21:49.529]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:12.700 --> 03:22:15.303]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:15.303 --> 03:22:21.669]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.669 --> 03:22:26.874]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.874 --> 03:22:36.863]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.963 --> 03:22:39.304]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:39.304 --> 03:22:40.905]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.905 --> 03:22:43.366]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:43.366 --> 03:22:45.487]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:45.487 --> 03:22:50.630]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.630 --> 03:22:55.652]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:22:55.652 --> 03:22:59.754]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:03.976 --> 03:23:05.196]  This is not a drill.
[03:23:05.196 --> 03:23:07.697]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[03:23:07.697 --> 03:23:09.598]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[03:23:09.598 --> 03:23:16.821]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[03:23:16.821 --> 03:23:21.223]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[03:23:21.223 --> 03:23:27.685]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect
[03:23:27.705 --> 03:23:28.565]  Perfect hiding place.
[03:23:28.565 --> 03:23:31.707]  As well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[03:23:31.707 --> 03:23:33.347]  Under any circumstance.
[03:23:33.347 --> 03:23:40.570]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[03:23:40.570 --> 03:23:41.290]  But listen up.
[03:23:41.290 --> 03:23:47.513]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[03:23:47.513 --> 03:23:49.373]  Go to hideyourguns.com.

[03:23:51.514 --> 03:23:52.014]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[03:23:52.014 --> 03:23:53.535]  Before they come for your guns,
[03:23:57.057 --> 03:23:59.300]  HideYourGuns.com right now!
[03:24:15.749 --> 03:24:19.495]  Sherry Jackson, IRS agent, went public, exposed the fraud.
[03:24:19.495 --> 03:24:21.218]  They arrested her, threw her in prison.
[03:24:21.218 --> 03:24:26.967]  They have special tax courts that are outside of the regular law, but these judges just do whatever they want.
[03:24:28.188 --> 03:24:32.631]  This is the private taxing system of the offshore banks that are raping and robbing us.
[03:24:32.631 --> 03:24:37.113]  And I have a special message to the police and military and others coming up in the next segment.
[03:24:37.113 --> 03:24:41.196]  But finishing up the story, you were telling about Alan Stang who died this year.
[03:24:41.196 --> 03:24:45.918]  Alan Stang being some of the things they did to him in jail.
[03:24:45.918 --> 03:24:54.684]  Well, they did everything possible, he said, to try him to get the rules so that they could mistreat him.
[03:24:54.684 --> 03:24:56.765]  And fortunately for him,
[03:24:57.279 --> 03:25:00.280]  He was very, very careful and it didn't happen.
[03:25:00.280 --> 03:25:07.982]  But these kinds of, quote, criminals are treated that way because they influence society in a big way.
[03:25:07.982 --> 03:25:17.365]  And anybody who is a tax processor, which Alan was at one time, has a field of influence.
[03:25:17.365 --> 03:25:20.746]  And so that's why they did what they did to him.
[03:25:20.746 --> 03:25:23.267]  And of course, as you know, he wrote a number of books.
[03:25:25.071 --> 03:25:34.679]  There's one we've been advertising, Perestroika Sunset, which is a very good book about what happened to our men in Southeast Asia.
[03:25:34.679 --> 03:25:38.162]  And we do have a few copies of it left.
[03:25:38.162 --> 03:25:42.105]  But anyway, that's what you can expect from government.
[03:25:42.105 --> 03:25:44.007]  They are in control.
[03:25:44.007 --> 03:25:52.494]  If you do lose and have to go to jail, you keep your mouth shut and just hope that you don't have to go through with
[03:25:53.651 --> 03:25:58.466]  That which this former IRS agent has gone through.
[03:26:00.402 --> 03:26:01.343]  Absolutely, Bob.
[03:26:01.343 --> 03:26:04.344]  Well, in closing, I'm going to come back and take calls and cover some news.
[03:26:04.344 --> 03:26:05.184]  We're going to let you go.
[03:26:05.184 --> 03:26:07.105]  We appreciate your weekly visit with us.
[03:26:07.105 --> 03:26:10.147]  People can go to TheInternationalForecaster.com, get a free issue there.
[03:26:10.147 --> 03:26:14.509]  It comes out twice a week in the e-format, a few times a month in the hard copy.
[03:26:14.509 --> 03:26:18.871]  In closing, I didn't want to get into this whole discussion about loser attitude.
[03:26:18.871 --> 03:26:24.354]  That's happened one time before when a caller called in and said something similar.
[03:26:24.354 --> 03:26:26.055]  But I'm not putting a good face on it.
[03:26:26.963 --> 03:26:30.866]  To say that we're having the biggest victories we've ever had week after week now.
[03:26:30.866 --> 03:26:35.469]  More victories than we would have in 10 years previously we're having in a week now.
[03:26:35.469 --> 03:26:45.637]  And that's only the beginning of this if people get up and stand up because the population is ready to hear the truth worldwide right now and the people are discovering this global government grid.
[03:26:46.457 --> 03:26:56.980]  And I just hope that everyone redoubles their efforts going into the new year to wake up as many people as they can and to take over their towns and cities peacefully through the political process.
[03:26:56.980 --> 03:27:00.181]  It's been the crooks and the liars and the parasites.
[03:27:00.181 --> 03:27:07.322]  They know the power of taking action, so they've gone in and taken over.
[03:27:07.322 --> 03:27:08.563]  Your comments on that statement?
[03:27:08.563 --> 03:27:11.544]  You know, they've taken over because we've allowed them to.
[03:27:11.544 --> 03:27:13.144]  We were too busy doing something else.
[03:27:14.210 --> 03:27:22.315]  And now with high unemployment, an economy that's spiraling downward, there is no recovery going on.
[03:27:22.315 --> 03:27:24.636]  That's just more propaganda.
[03:27:24.636 --> 03:27:30.919]  And unless they increase and have another stimulus plan, we're going to go into depression.
[03:27:30.919 --> 03:27:34.882]  And before we get there, there's going to be a lot of inflation.
[03:27:34.882 --> 03:27:38.063]  And so the public's got to wake up.
[03:27:39.432 --> 03:27:42.094]  Say to themselves, well, gee, why did this all happen?
[03:27:42.094 --> 03:27:47.258]  And get outside the box and listen to Alex and people like him who are talking about this.
[03:27:47.258 --> 03:27:55.945]  Well, Bob, I read earlier an El Centro holds position for the highest jobless rate in the country, CNN Money, of 32.2%.
[03:27:55.945 --> 03:27:58.467]  All the real indexes nationally are over 20.
[03:27:58.467 --> 03:28:00.769]  CNBC says 17.5.
[03:28:00.769 --> 03:28:03.631]  But Obama says unemployment is dropping, Bob.
[03:28:05.011 --> 03:28:10.899]  Well yeah, the U3 is what they call that, and it just dropped from 10.2 to 10%.
[03:28:10.899 --> 03:28:18.649]  And you know, I have the breakdown on the jobs here, and payroll at builders declined $27,000 after falling $56,000 the month before.
[03:28:21.694 --> 03:28:29.277]  And the factory payrolls fell $41,000 after decreasing $51,000 the month before.
[03:28:29.277 --> 03:28:31.318]  These are the high paying jobs.
[03:28:31.318 --> 03:28:34.839]  Now let's go over to where the jobs were recreated.
[03:28:34.839 --> 03:28:39.741]  And I'll preface this by saying these are the lowest paying jobs in the economy.
[03:28:39.741 --> 03:28:45.643]  Banks, insurance companies, restaurants, and retailers.
[03:28:45.643 --> 03:28:48.304]  And that's only a microscopic Christmas bump.
[03:28:50.876 --> 03:29:09.124]  Well, it is not a truthful annual take on this thing because, you know, retailers add people because it's Christmas time, as you point out, and then restaurants do more business because people are rushing from here to there because it's a holiday season.
[03:29:09.124 --> 03:29:13.986]  And banks and insurance companies, I don't know how many they put on, but I don't think it was very many.
[03:29:15.549 --> 03:29:16.529]  Amazing.
[03:29:16.529 --> 03:29:22.232]  Bob Chapman, we'll talk to you again coming up live next Friday in the one o'clock hour.
[03:29:22.232 --> 03:29:23.272]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[03:29:23.272 --> 03:29:25.353]  Have a great weekend.
[03:29:25.353 --> 03:29:26.194]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:29:26.194 --> 03:29:29.215]  And audience, thank you very much.
[03:29:29.215 --> 03:29:34.757]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back after this quick break.
[03:29:34.757 --> 03:29:35.518]  I want to go over.
[03:29:36.840 --> 03:29:41.843]  This Sherry Jackson IRS agent being slowly murdered in prison.
[03:29:41.843 --> 03:29:48.427]  I've got a message to the people out there in government that think of us as animals and think all their sins are cute and funny.
[03:29:48.427 --> 03:29:51.969]  It's not cute and you're going to be judged.
[03:29:51.969 --> 03:29:53.350]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.350 --> 03:29:55.891]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.891 --> 03:29:58.573]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.349 --> 03:30:07.912]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[03:30:26.863 --> 03:30:31.366]  It relieves the pain fast and fights the inflammation to keep the pain away longer.

[03:31:02.617 --> 03:31:06.641]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:06.641 --> 03:31:09.885]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:09.885 --> 03:31:14.670]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:14.670 --> 03:31:21.077]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.077 --> 03:31:23.320]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:31:23.820 --> 03:31:25.021]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:25.021 --> 03:31:25.781]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:25.781 --> 03:31:28.103]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:42.751 --> 03:31:50.018]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.018 --> 03:31:59.146]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:32:01.837 --> 03:32:04.859]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:32:04.859 --> 03:32:10.183]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:32:10.183 --> 03:32:12.224]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:32:12.224 --> 03:32:17.227]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:32:17.227 --> 03:32:18.428]  How much do you want?
[03:32:18.428 --> 03:32:19.549]  When do you want it?
[03:32:19.549 --> 03:32:21.430]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:32:21.430 --> 03:32:22.511]  When will you need it?
[03:32:22.511 --> 03:32:24.712]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:32:24.712 --> 03:32:26.053]  Will there be any food?
[03:32:26.053 --> 03:32:27.574]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:32:27.574 --> 03:32:28.615]  If there's a quarantine,
[03:32:28.775 --> 03:32:30.096]  And you can't feed yourself?
[03:32:30.096 --> 03:32:32.819]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:32:32.819 --> 03:32:36.402]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:32:36.402 --> 03:32:40.225]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:32:40.225 --> 03:32:41.467]  How much will you need?
[03:32:41.467 --> 03:32:42.367]  We don't know.
[03:32:42.367 --> 03:32:43.468]  How much do you want?
[03:32:43.468 --> 03:32:44.209]  All you can get.
[03:32:44.209 --> 03:32:45.210]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:32:45.490 --> 03:32:48.531]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:32:48.531 --> 03:32:49.052]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:32:49.052 --> 03:32:51.373]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:32:51.373 --> 03:32:52.213]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:32:52.213 --> 03:32:54.434]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[03:32:54.434 --> 03:32:56.215]  In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[03:33:15.876 --> 03:33:18.359]  I just realized I've done 2 hours, 3 hours, and 33 minutes.
[03:33:18.359 --> 03:33:19.901]  3 hours and 33 minutes of radio.
[03:33:30.145 --> 03:33:31.725]  I haven't even plugged any of our sponsors.
[03:33:31.725 --> 03:33:33.106]  I'm going to do that.
[03:33:33.106 --> 03:33:37.067]  Then I've got a little message to the police, military, government, bureaucrats.
[03:33:37.067 --> 03:33:38.948]  I understand your mindset, your psychology.
[03:33:38.948 --> 03:33:41.648]  I'm going to talk directly to you here in just a moment.
[03:33:41.648 --> 03:33:43.609]  First, I want to tell you about some of our sponsors.
[03:33:43.609 --> 03:33:49.891]  You've heard all the medical doctors here on the show talk about colloidal silver, nano silver, how good it is against bacteria and viruses.
[03:33:51.011 --> 03:33:58.221]  And one of the greatest delivery systems is the lungs, and they have details about that at silverlungs.com.
[03:33:58.221 --> 03:34:00.825]  Silverlungs.com.
[03:34:00.825 --> 03:34:07.053]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a highly cost-effective colloidal silver generator and lung delivery system that produces pure and endless colloidal silver.
[03:34:07.594 --> 03:34:07.994]  I think so.
[03:34:32.768 --> 03:34:35.089]  Seven and a half gallons a day and average humidity out of the air.
[03:34:35.089 --> 03:34:36.050]  That's their smaller unit.
[03:34:36.050 --> 03:34:39.112]  Looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top.
[03:34:39.112 --> 03:34:39.953]  It's Ecolablue.
[03:34:39.953 --> 03:34:42.834]  Ecolablue.com.
[03:34:42.834 --> 03:34:44.535]  Fabulous line of products.
[03:34:44.535 --> 03:34:47.817]  The atmospheric water generator I use in my home.
[03:34:47.817 --> 03:34:49.739]  Ecolablue.com or give them a call at 800-691-6043.
[03:34:49.739 --> 03:34:49.919]  That's 800-691-6043.
[03:34:55.583 --> 03:35:03.573]  Yes, there is water in the atmosphere and you can grab it out then it goes through seven stage filter process and is stored in a tank.
[03:35:03.573 --> 03:35:04.474]  Stainless steel on the bottom.
[03:35:04.474 --> 03:35:06.136]  It has hot water and cold water.
[03:35:06.136 --> 03:35:07.378]  It's just a really great unit.
[03:35:07.378 --> 03:35:07.959]  Acolabloo.com 800-691-6043.
[03:35:12.065 --> 03:35:15.208]  And finally, I want to tell you about Front Sight Firearms Training.
[03:35:15.208 --> 03:35:17.430]  Frontsight.com, like the front of your rifle.
[03:35:17.430 --> 03:35:21.093]  Frontsight.com is the premier private firearms training in the country.
[03:35:21.093 --> 03:35:26.037]  A lot of military and police go there to tune up their training to above law enforcement and military training.
[03:35:26.037 --> 03:35:27.098]  It's the biggest private...
[03:35:28.117 --> 03:35:29.577]  Firearms Training Center in the country.
[03:35:29.577 --> 03:35:32.398]  They have a lot of free information on their site, FrontSite.com.

[03:37:55.444 --> 03:38:00.627]  Okay, I want to take about a three-minute breather here before I really give this message to the police and military.
[03:38:00.627 --> 03:38:06.351]  Will you guys get that Switzerland newscast about why Switzerland has the lowest crime rate?
[03:38:06.351 --> 03:38:07.452]  Remember that video I gave you this morning?
[03:38:08.485 --> 03:38:17.350]  As soon as you get that queued up, I want to play that because it's a message I want to put out there about why their crime rate is so low and how our founding fathers went off the Swiss model.
[03:38:17.350 --> 03:38:28.075]  That's really where our model came from, where everyone must own a gun by law and you have to do drills where you practice hiding them from the government in case the government is taken over by tyranny.
[03:38:28.075 --> 03:38:36.479]  The government teaches the people if the government ever says give your guns in, that's a tyranny and under federal law they are to resist it with lethal force.
[03:38:36.479 --> 03:38:37.740]  That's what our founders fought too.
[03:38:38.340 --> 03:38:46.364]  I mean, as soon as they say, give us your guns, they are criminal, they are corrupt, they are bad, they are illegitimate, they are evil.
[03:38:46.364 --> 03:38:51.167]  And we have just put up with this for far too long in this society.
[03:38:51.167 --> 03:38:59.692]  So I want to play this clip and then come back with a special message to those in the establishment that are violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution and are not guardians of the Republic.
[03:39:03.911 --> 03:39:08.155]  It's designed to destroy anything standing within its 400 meter trajectory.
[03:39:08.155 --> 03:39:15.241]  And there are over 500,000 of them kept in Swiss homes.
[03:39:15.241 --> 03:39:18.243]  Guns and shooting are a strong Swiss tradition.
[03:39:18.243 --> 03:39:20.825]  Basic military training is mandatory for young men.
[03:39:20.825 --> 03:39:26.130]  And afterwards, they're required to keep their weapon at home.
[03:39:26.130 --> 03:39:29.572]  Mark Heim is the Ticino representative for the lobby group Protel.
[03:39:33.144 --> 03:39:42.730]  Basically this was my father's military rifle and of course he got to keep it when he was finished.
[03:39:42.730 --> 03:39:47.852]  I have my grandfather's rifle in the office hanging on the wall.
[03:39:47.852 --> 03:39:52.295]  This was mine when I did service, which is quite an old one.
[03:39:52.295 --> 03:39:53.615]  It was introduced in 1957.
[03:39:53.615 --> 03:39:56.897]  It was used until 1990.
[03:39:59.591 --> 03:40:02.172]  And this is my son's.
[03:40:02.172 --> 03:40:05.613]  That's the current model.
[03:40:05.613 --> 03:40:08.054]  That's what's being used today.
[03:40:08.054 --> 03:40:11.615]  That's what we'll be using to shoot the Feldschießen today.
[03:40:11.615 --> 03:40:21.458]  The Feldschießen, or Tiro-Federalien-Kampagne, as it's known in these parts, is an annual Swiss event, and it's also the largest shooting festival in the world.
[03:40:21.458 --> 03:40:25.079]  Roughly 200,000 people come out to target practice all across the country.
[03:40:26.129 --> 03:40:28.090]  Ammunition is provided by the government.
[03:40:28.090 --> 03:40:34.214]  Heim goes regularly to this range, and it's often a family affair.
[03:40:34.214 --> 03:40:42.780]  It was organized by the government to have a very high state of readiness for the Swiss military and population.
[03:40:42.780 --> 03:40:50.165]  The target has always been that within 24 to 48 hours, Switzerland could mobilize a pretty large army.
[03:40:50.165 --> 03:40:51.686]  I mean, even by European standards,
[03:40:58.342 --> 03:41:02.866]  But it wasn't the militia that sparked Haim's interest in guns as a young man.
[03:41:02.866 --> 03:41:05.668]  It was an unassuming trip to a Holocaust museum.
[03:41:05.668 --> 03:41:11.593]  I was going through all the exhibits and the soap and the lampshades made of people's skin.
[03:41:12.856 --> 03:41:26.820]  And while I was looking, I heard a funny noise, and there was an old woman, maybe two meters from me, and she was trying not to cry.
[03:41:26.820 --> 03:41:29.001]  She was sort of sobbing very quietly.
[03:41:29.001 --> 03:41:29.821]  She was holding it back.
[03:41:29.821 --> 03:41:32.842]  If she had been a few meters further away, I wouldn't have heard her.
[03:41:32.842 --> 03:41:35.663]  And she obviously had gone through that.
[03:41:35.663 --> 03:41:38.484]  That's when the whole impact of it hit me.
[03:41:39.804 --> 03:41:42.978]  And I promised myself I would never be in her situation.
[03:41:44.495 --> 03:41:56.060]  I would want to be free, never in a situation where somebody could, you know, march us off to ovens or prisons or just take away our freedom.
[03:41:56.060 --> 03:42:00.821]  The key to freedom is the ability to be able to defend yourself.
[03:42:00.821 --> 03:42:07.524]  And if you don't have the tools to do that, then you are at the mercy of whoever wants to put you away.
[03:42:07.524 --> 03:42:09.945]  And the tools for that are guns.
[03:42:13.220 --> 03:42:18.523]  Absolutely, well said there in that short video.
[03:42:18.523 --> 03:42:25.007]  You see, we got the secret Homeland Security and MIAC documents earlier in the year.
[03:42:25.007 --> 03:42:26.307]  We broke it.
[03:42:26.307 --> 03:42:32.571]  People couldn't believe it when it said Ron Paul supporters were terrorists, gun owners were terrorists, returning veterans were the main threat.
[03:42:32.571 --> 03:42:36.473]  That Homeland Security was really built to rob the American people.
[03:42:36.473 --> 03:42:39.855]  It's an internal police force like the Soviets or the Nazis had.
[03:42:40.655 --> 03:42:44.717]  To make you thumb scan, face scan, national ID card to buy and sell.
[03:42:44.717 --> 03:42:50.100]  They're now saying if you're on the no-fly list that they just put you on with no evidence, you won't be able to buy a gun.
[03:42:50.100 --> 03:42:53.082]  This is the hardcore tyranny.
[03:42:53.082 --> 03:43:04.068]  And I know the police and military are brainwashed how the public doesn't like them and they're the only line of defense against anarchy and, oh, they're out there stopping lawlessness.
[03:43:04.068 --> 03:43:09.531]  And to a great extent that's true because they're doing some things that are good and then a lot of things that are bad as well.
[03:43:10.828 --> 03:43:15.754]  And you have a federal government that has been taken over by private offshore banks.
[03:43:15.754 --> 03:43:22.041]  And it's illegitimate and criminal and violates the Bill of Rights and Constitution from one end to the other.
[03:43:22.041 --> 03:43:27.807]  And that's a very simple equation that I know you can understand.
[03:43:28.948 --> 03:43:30.870]  Servants of the system.
[03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:32.051]  I have seen police.
[03:43:32.051 --> 03:43:33.052]  I have seen judges.
[03:43:33.052 --> 03:43:34.713]  I have seen bureaucrats.
[03:43:34.713 --> 03:43:36.875]  Relish setting people up.
[03:43:36.875 --> 03:43:38.716]  Relish framing people.
[03:43:38.716 --> 03:43:41.719]  Relish beating somebody up and then saying that they assaulted you.
[03:43:44.793 --> 03:43:50.976]  I have seen how we've been trained that evil and corruption and deception is manly and cool.
[03:43:50.976 --> 03:43:56.259]  And Jack Bauer on 24 tortures innocent people, but he's a good guy.
[03:43:56.259 --> 03:44:03.723]  And all these other programs brainwashing us, turning the American people into evil, corrupt creatures.
[03:44:03.723 --> 03:44:05.864]  Our country has been illegitimately hijacked.
[03:44:06.977 --> 03:44:14.279]  It's bigger than the political parties, it's a financial dictatorship, and the government is a crooked, corrupt fraud.
[03:44:14.279 --> 03:44:15.479]  Period.
[03:44:15.479 --> 03:44:26.822]  Now, the American people don't want physical war with the criminal system, but it's going to want physical war, and it's engaged in physical war against us every day.
[03:44:26.822 --> 03:44:35.624]  And people everywhere are waking up to this injustice, and I just want the police and military and bureaucrats and everyone else to realize
[03:44:36.889 --> 03:44:41.774]  The American people and the people of the world who are being tyrannized are human beings.
[03:44:41.774 --> 03:44:42.695]  We have value.
[03:44:44.005 --> 03:44:55.869]  When you falsely charge us, or falsely arrest us, or falsely persecute us, or when these grand juries become kept creatures of the prosecutor, and engage in corruption against good people.
[03:44:55.869 --> 03:44:59.790]  Throw the book at innocent patriots, but release violent offenders.
[03:44:59.790 --> 03:45:09.034]  You are committing massive frauds and massive crimes, and it doesn't matter if your corrupt system gives you a green light to do it and tells you it's okay.
[03:45:09.034 --> 03:45:12.855]  You know in your gut it's wrong, and it's not cute, and it's not funny.
[03:45:15.174 --> 03:45:21.800]  Now, as a society, we are at a crossroads.
[03:45:21.800 --> 03:45:32.991]  And I just ask servants of the establishment, even if you've engaged in corruption and lied to yourself about it and rationalized why you're doing it, it's not too late for you to turn back.
[03:45:34.457 --> 03:45:43.463]  And just at least start being a better person and start treating people like human beings and stop engaging in corruption and violations of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:45:43.463 --> 03:45:46.205]  Because the bankers have decided to bring us into depression.
[03:45:46.205 --> 03:45:48.026]  They've decided to set up a police state.
[03:45:48.026 --> 03:45:50.667]  They've decided to try to forcibly inoculate people.
[03:45:50.667 --> 03:45:54.970]  They've decided to corner people and force the population to fight back.
[03:45:54.970 --> 03:45:57.852]  And more and more of that is going to happen.
[03:45:57.852 --> 03:46:03.296]  And in the end, the police and military that try to engage the American people in tyranny
[03:46:04.125 --> 03:46:11.150]  Are going to be known as enemies of the Republic and are going to be known in history as scum and are going to be brought to justice.
[03:46:11.150 --> 03:46:14.392]  So you need to listen to me very careful right now.
[03:46:14.392 --> 03:46:25.219]  It is time for you to unharden your hearts and to really reflect this weekend on who you are and what you are and who you want to be in this short life.
[03:46:25.219 --> 03:46:30.283]  It is now time for you to do the right thing.
[03:46:30.283 --> 03:46:32.705]  I hope you'll do the right thing, but at least reflect
[03:46:33.795 --> 03:46:42.478]  On what our country and what our world has turned into, and ask yourself, do you want to change course in your life?
[03:46:42.478 --> 03:46:54.461]  Because if you don't know this government's corrupt, if you don't know our society's imploding, if you don't know that the government's illegitimate, and if you don't understand it's growing like a cancer, you are blind.
[03:46:54.461 --> 03:46:55.682]  Something is wrong with you.
[03:46:55.682 --> 03:46:59.923]  Something is fundamentally screwed up with you.
[03:46:59.923 --> 03:47:02.344]  There, I've said it.
[03:47:02.344 --> 03:47:02.484]  Now,
[03:47:03.561 --> 03:47:09.622]  We have an article up on InfoWars.com, America Freedom to Fascism star Sherry Jackson is being murdered.
[03:47:09.622 --> 03:47:16.644]  I would have the headline, Valiant Inside IRS Whistleblower Being Politically Persecuted and Tortured.
[03:47:16.644 --> 03:47:18.904]  I don't know about being a star.
[03:47:18.904 --> 03:47:22.785]  I don't ever think of this work we do as being stars, but my heart breaks.
[03:47:22.785 --> 03:47:29.166]  How do those continue to sit by as our fellow human beings are put behind bars and treated as subhuman?
[03:47:29.166 --> 03:47:30.866]  Have we lost touch with our humanity?
[03:47:30.866 --> 03:47:31.587]  Yes.
[03:47:31.587 --> 03:47:33.187]  And when we lose touch with our humanity,
[03:47:35.407 --> 03:47:39.288]  Then everybody starts getting abused because people then accept it.
[03:47:39.288 --> 03:47:40.729]  I see hundreds of movies now.
[03:47:40.729 --> 03:47:43.550]  Every movie where they show tasering and being tortured is fun.
[03:47:43.550 --> 03:47:47.031]  They're selling us that torture is cute and funny.
[03:47:47.031 --> 03:47:52.033]  I pray for those behind bars as our country holds more prisoners than any other country on the planet.
[03:47:52.033 --> 03:47:54.453]  Even Obama's favorite, Red China.
[03:47:54.453 --> 03:47:57.735]  We see how they treat brown people in cages overseas.
[03:47:57.735 --> 03:48:00.075]  They are profiled as potential terrorists.
[03:48:00.075 --> 03:48:02.396]  You think they're going to treat us any better?
[03:48:02.396 --> 03:48:04.697]  Torture is torture and it's wrong no matter
[03:48:05.796 --> 03:48:06.876]  When used.
[03:48:06.876 --> 03:48:10.198]  In this regard, I choose to walk with Christ, and it goes on from there.
[03:48:10.198 --> 03:48:13.299]  That's the person that wrote this article at Don't Tread on Me.
[03:48:13.299 --> 03:48:21.323]  Now, they then give out the call and fax numbers demanding immediate medication for Sherry Jackson.
[03:48:21.323 --> 03:48:23.144]  And here is Sherry Jackson's letter.
[03:48:25.319 --> 03:48:29.062]  That we posted up at Infowars.com.
[03:48:29.062 --> 03:48:30.643]  Hi friends and family.
[03:48:30.643 --> 03:48:31.944]  Please pray for my wife.
[03:48:31.944 --> 03:48:34.126]  This is from her husband, Sherry Peele Jackson.
[03:48:34.126 --> 03:48:37.489]  She's still having challenges while she's incarcerated.
[03:48:37.489 --> 03:48:39.951]  Thank you in advance for your prayers and encouragement.
[03:48:39.951 --> 03:48:44.234]  Here's a letter from Sherry to our congressman concerning her current situation.
[03:48:44.234 --> 03:48:47.397]  I am Sherry Peele Jackson, your former CPA.
[03:48:47.397 --> 03:48:50.900]  I am writing you because I am concerned that my health and my life.
[03:48:50.900 --> 03:48:53.622]  Prior to becoming a political prisoner, I was the pitcher of health.
[03:48:54.696 --> 03:48:59.222]  In late June 2009, I started experiencing a rapid heartbeat on a regular basis.
[03:48:59.222 --> 03:49:07.372]  That's because it's all GMO, all soy, which is filled with estrogen, all MSG.
[03:49:07.372 --> 03:49:09.495]  It's chemical weapons, what they feed people in prison.
[03:49:10.566 --> 03:49:13.568]  Since this has happened infrequently in the past, I did not think much of it.
[03:49:13.568 --> 03:49:17.711]  However, in mid-July, it started happening on a regular basis, and I became concerned.
[03:49:17.711 --> 03:49:25.617]  I went to the medical staff twice in mid-July, only to be given one-minute EKG tests and powerful meds without proper diagnosis.
[03:49:25.617 --> 03:49:28.739]  I did not take the meds because I had not seen a specialist.
[03:49:28.739 --> 03:49:30.520]  One week later, on July 21st, I felt the
[03:49:34.246 --> 03:49:38.030]  I left the dorm in flip-flops to go tell the officers I was having a heart attack.
[03:49:38.030 --> 03:49:44.317]  The officers on duty called the ambulance, and the ambulance checked my heart for their Profile EKG system machine.
[03:49:44.317 --> 03:49:46.379]  It was beating at 150 beats per minute.
[03:49:46.379 --> 03:49:50.224]  They took me to a hospital where I remained until Friday.
[03:49:50.224 --> 03:49:55.289]  During my hospital stay, it was determined that my heart was healthy, but my thyroid was producing too much hormones.
[03:49:56.050 --> 03:50:01.251]  Everybody's having their thyroids removed right now from all the chemicals in the food, thus speeding up my heart.
[03:50:01.251 --> 03:50:04.392]  This is called hyperthyroidism or Graves' disease.
[03:50:04.392 --> 03:50:08.793]  I was given two medications by the hospital and then it goes on.
[03:50:08.793 --> 03:50:15.915]  The hospital doctor told me four weeks later the prison medical unit was to do blood tests to determine how the thyroid medication was affecting my body.
[03:50:15.915 --> 03:50:21.597]  The blood test was taken in late August and I was told I would be placed on the appropriate schedule and it goes on from there.
[03:50:24.605 --> 03:50:32.732]  And then it just goes into how they're now denying her care, even though they admit she has this problem.
[03:50:32.732 --> 03:50:33.753]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:50:33.753 --> 03:50:34.534]  It's a long letter.
[03:50:34.534 --> 03:50:36.235]  It's up on the site.
[03:50:36.235 --> 03:50:37.716]  But it's the food they feed them.
[03:50:37.716 --> 03:50:39.658]  We've done a whole show on this in the past.
[03:50:39.658 --> 03:50:42.761]  And they do all sorts of medical experiments on people in the prisons as well.
[03:50:42.761 --> 03:50:44.782]  I'm going to come back and hit the key parts of this.
[03:50:48.001 --> 03:50:51.866]  Finish up with what's happening to this political prisoner right now.
[03:50:51.866 --> 03:50:56.091]  They tried to set up Joe Bannister, the former Treasury agent, but he beat him in court.
[03:50:56.091 --> 03:50:59.075]  She didn't because the judge ordered the jury to convict her, which is criminal.
[03:51:02.014 --> 03:51:05.398]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:51:05.398 --> 03:51:09.302]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:51:09.302 --> 03:51:13.027]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:51:13.027 --> 03:51:14.909]  And less than 2 cents per gallon.
[03:51:14.909 --> 03:51:20.555]  Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[03:51:20.575 --> 03:51:20.875]  I think so.
[03:51:46.267 --> 03:51:50.649]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:51:50.649 --> 03:51:52.770]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:51:52.770 --> 03:51:54.651]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.603 --> 03:52:15.266]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.266 --> 03:52:21.652]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.652 --> 03:52:26.857]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.857 --> 03:52:36.846]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.946 --> 03:52:39.307]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.307 --> 03:52:40.888]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.888 --> 03:52:43.349]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.349 --> 03:52:45.470]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.470 --> 03:52:50.632]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.632 --> 03:52:59.736]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:01.698 --> 03:53:02.439]  Hello, friends.
[03:53:02.439 --> 03:53:05.562]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[03:53:05.562 --> 03:53:15.751]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[03:53:15.751 --> 03:53:19.675]  Go to 5starsoaps.com or click on their link at InfoWars.com.
[03:53:19.675 --> 03:53:21.636]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:53:21.636 --> 03:53:25.460]  Cal Bend Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[03:53:25.460 --> 03:53:27.602]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[03:53:28.002 --> 03:53:33.224]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.
[03:53:33.224 --> 03:53:38.227]  Check out their whole line of bath, hair, laundry, and dish soap and more at 5starsoap.com.
[03:53:38.227 --> 03:53:43.609]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[03:53:43.609 --> 03:53:44.890]  Don't take my word for it.

[03:53:53.694 --> 03:53:57.236]  Again, go to 5starsoap.com and just try their products.
[03:53:57.236 --> 03:53:58.196]  You're gonna love them.
[03:53:58.196 --> 03:54:05.981]  You will never use anything else again.
[03:54:05.981 --> 03:54:11.364]  So the letter goes on admitting that she has this thyroid problem.
[03:54:11.364 --> 03:54:13.125]  They just take her off the medication.
[03:54:13.125 --> 03:54:14.826]  Her lips are swollen up and are black.
[03:54:14.826 --> 03:54:15.787]  Blood's coming out.
[03:54:17.540 --> 03:54:18.842]  She's writing to her congressman.
[03:54:18.842 --> 03:54:20.423]  She says, I'm 46 years old.
[03:54:20.423 --> 03:54:21.985]  I know my body.
[03:54:21.985 --> 03:54:24.969]  I finally convinced them that I was not playing and was not stupid.
[03:54:24.969 --> 03:54:28.913]  So they treated me with a packet for stool sample test.
[03:54:29.827 --> 03:54:37.494]  When it came back, they admitted that even months before I'd had the thyroid problem, the blood test showed the problem with the thyroid was happening back then.
[03:54:37.494 --> 03:54:42.699]  He said I would be put on a schedule for new blood work later that week because the results were too old.
[03:54:42.699 --> 03:54:47.903]  He had a short conversation with Dr. D. Lyon in Spanish and then said the thyroid count was off.
[03:54:48.644 --> 03:54:49.845]  That was November 3rd.
[03:54:49.845 --> 03:54:56.547]  I was administered the stool test and then returned to Nurse Charlie on Friday, November 26th.
[03:54:56.547 --> 03:54:58.788]  Today is November 26th, Thanksgiving.
[03:54:58.788 --> 03:55:01.129]  I have not received the results of my stool test.
[03:55:01.129 --> 03:55:02.590]  I have not been given any new blood tests.
[03:55:02.590 --> 03:55:04.550]  My neck is swelling up like a fishbowl.
[03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:06.051]  I'm having trouble talking.
[03:55:06.051 --> 03:55:08.432]  I've been feeling very ill for the last weeks.
[03:55:08.432 --> 03:55:10.313]  Congressman, I don't want them to kill me in here.
[03:55:11.113 --> 03:55:14.316]  As you know well, I am being punished for exposing government fraud.
[03:55:14.316 --> 03:55:16.958]  However, millions of people don't file tax returns.
[03:55:16.958 --> 03:55:24.323]  I was just used as an example by the DOJ for the new program called the Tax Defiers Initiative.
[03:55:24.323 --> 03:55:26.445]  I have a wonderful husband and two beautiful children.
[03:55:26.445 --> 03:55:32.470]  I've already spent 21 months in prison for non-crime, and I refuse to come out dead or marred for life.
[03:55:32.470 --> 03:55:34.772]  I have not caused these people any problems.
[03:55:34.772 --> 03:55:38.755]  This is no threat, but just for your information, I have
[03:55:39.534 --> 03:55:42.715]  Written the warden today.
[03:55:42.715 --> 03:55:47.317]  Things can't go on this way as I language in here for someone's political gain.
[03:55:47.317 --> 03:55:51.199]  God doesn't like ugly and he is the ultimate judge and vindicator.
[03:55:52.639 --> 03:55:53.740]  That's right.
[03:55:53.740 --> 03:56:00.903]  These wardens, these police, these jail guards that are involved in evil, they all have the most hellish lives statistically.
[03:56:00.903 --> 03:56:05.225]  Cancer, alcohol, drug, their families, their kids dying in car wrecks.
[03:56:05.225 --> 03:56:06.566]  Don't worry.
[03:56:06.566 --> 03:56:11.269]  Anyone that abuses good people doesn't have to wait until they die to be judged.
[03:56:11.269 --> 03:56:13.230]  You get judged now.
[03:56:13.230 --> 03:56:16.551]  Anything bad you do in life comes back on you sevenfold.
[03:56:16.551 --> 03:56:19.733]  The good book says that and it's true.
[03:56:19.733 --> 03:56:21.294]  That's why I want to tell wicked people
[03:56:22.242 --> 03:56:30.368]  I've been in jail several times, arrested at protest, and every time I've had police slam my head in walls and laugh at me and push me around.
[03:56:30.368 --> 03:56:31.809]  I've seen scum.
[03:56:31.809 --> 03:56:33.110]  I've seen criminals.
[03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:35.112]  I know evil people when I see them.
[03:56:35.112 --> 03:56:40.456]  And the police and the jail guards, their ranks are filled with sadists and sickos and filth.
[03:56:41.357 --> 03:56:47.962]  Who would slam my head in a wall or punch me in the back trying to get me to fight back so they could beat the living daylights out of me.
[03:56:47.962 --> 03:56:52.565]  These are un-American, Nazi blood-sucking, murdering trash.
[03:56:52.565 --> 03:56:57.169]  And they release the hardcore criminals to come out and menace the public.
[03:56:57.169 --> 03:57:01.672]  And the media and the culture is all about worshipping them and worshipping their corruption.
[03:57:01.672 --> 03:57:02.953]  But the people know the truth.
[03:57:02.953 --> 03:57:07.236]  Now, there are a lot of good police, and I'm sure there must be some good jail guards.
[03:57:07.236 --> 03:57:07.857]  I haven't met them.
[03:57:09.321 --> 03:57:11.943]  And what you're doing is evil.
[03:57:11.943 --> 03:57:13.424]  And what you're doing is wrong.
[03:57:13.424 --> 03:57:16.547]  And just like Hitler's goons, you're going to be brought to justice.
[03:57:16.547 --> 03:57:23.192]  So, if you're on the wrong side of history, you better get back on the right side of history.
[03:57:23.192 --> 03:57:24.813]  She's in the F.C.I.
[03:57:24.813 --> 03:57:28.436]  Coleman Medium Federal Correctional Institution.
[03:57:28.436 --> 03:57:28.776]  P.O.
[03:57:28.776 --> 03:57:29.197]  Box 1032.
[03:57:29.197 --> 03:57:34.881]  Now these crooks don't care that you know that they're killing her.
[03:57:34.881 --> 03:57:36.983]  But they are afraid of the political repercussions.
[03:57:38.061 --> 03:57:45.065]  Okay, so they're enjoying what they're doing, but they are concerned about people learning about what's happening.
[03:57:45.065 --> 03:57:49.447]  See, for a psychopath, it's the pain they induce on people is their daily pleasure.
[03:57:49.447 --> 03:57:51.128]  You like a cup of coffee?
[03:57:51.128 --> 03:57:51.888]  Or going fishing?
[03:57:51.888 --> 03:57:53.169]  They like torturing people.
[03:57:53.169 --> 03:57:54.310]  It's a petty power thing.
[03:57:54.310 --> 03:57:56.351]  They get off on it.
[03:57:56.351 --> 03:57:57.231]  Coleman, Florida, 33521.
[03:57:59.787 --> 03:58:03.891]  And the website information's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:58:03.891 --> 03:58:06.373]  The phone numbers are up on InfoWars.com.
[03:58:06.373 --> 03:58:09.076]  Everybody call these criminals.
[03:58:09.076 --> 03:58:11.978]  Let them know we're fully aware of their criminal activity.
[03:58:11.978 --> 03:58:20.126]  And let them know if they're wondering why their lives are so cursed, why they're so unhappy, it's because most of your prisoners are innocent people you're torturing to death.
[03:58:20.126 --> 03:58:20.847]  And you know why.
[03:58:21.906 --> 03:58:23.167]  You wonder why your life's so bad?
[03:58:23.167 --> 03:58:24.408]  It's because you're evil!
[03:58:24.408 --> 03:58:24.688]  Okay?
[03:58:24.688 --> 03:58:26.009]  That's why you're not happy.
[03:58:26.009 --> 03:58:27.470]  More evil isn't going to make it better.
[03:58:27.470 --> 03:58:29.152]  Back Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:29.152 --> 03:58:29.892]  Central.
