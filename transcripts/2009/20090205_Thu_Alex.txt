[00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:16.198]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:16.878 --> 00:00:17.659]  You want answers?
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.361]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:23.685]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:28.249]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:35.113]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting the syndicated radio broadcast.
[00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:39.935]  We've got a top volcanologist joining us coming up in the next segment to get into what's happening in Yellowstone.
[00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:43.676]  We'll get into the Second Amendment a lot more in the hour after that with Aaron Zellman and Jason Bermas.
[00:00:45.317 --> 00:00:47.358]  Alright, I've got to cover this sometime today.
[00:00:47.398 --> 00:00:49.198]  I'm going to get back into it with Jason Bermas.
[00:00:49.938 --> 00:00:50.879]  Gore to children.
[00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:55.320]  Question your parents' climate beliefs as we questioned segregation.
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:09.424]  So see, now, if you're not for accepting global taxes and that there's global warming and that the seasons are unnatural and it's not supposed to get hotter and colder and that you are a Holocaust denier, you don't like black people, you're against civil rights,
[00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:13.063]  And before I get to this, look at this New York Times story.
[00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:17.504]  Pint-sized eco-police making parents proud and sometimes crazy.
[00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:27.346]  In public and private school all over the nation, the majority of them, I've seen Time magazine for kids saying, that's given out to public schools, oh your parents are backwards and dumb.
[00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:29.487]  They don't know how great it is to get an implantable chip.
[00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:35.903]  The Nazis, the Soviets, they always come and tell the children, you're the boss of your parents, report on them!
[00:01:36.183 --> 00:01:43.006]  And all over the country, they have BATF grants to local police, they have officers in the middle schools writing dossiers on their parents.
[00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:45.708]  I covered my film, police stay due to takeover.
[00:01:45.748 --> 00:01:46.608]  I mean, this is happening.
[00:01:47.048 --> 00:01:54.972]  And you read this article, sometimes Jennifer Ross feels she cannot make a move at home without inviting the scorn of her daughters, 10-year-old Grace and 7-year-old Alyssa.
[00:01:55.012 --> 00:01:59.274]  And it shows the daughters bossing her on the photo, looking at her like this, and she's...
[00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:01.336]  Yes, Master.
[00:02:02.777 --> 00:02:05.501]  The Acura MDX she drives, a flagrant polluter.
[00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:07.583]  The bath at night to help her relax.
[00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:09.826]  A wasteful indulgence.
[00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:12.489]  The reusable shopping bag she forgot.
[00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:20.003]  Again, tsk, tsk, I am very, very, very environmentally conscious children, more so than me, and I'm embarrassed to say, said Ms.
[00:02:20.063 --> 00:02:24.444]  Ross, a social worker in Dobsphere, New York, they are on my case about getting a hybrid car.
[00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:27.965]  They want me to replace all the light bulbs in the house with energy-saving bulbs.
[00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:35.026]  And then now that says they don't use the washer, they've got clotheslines in the house, and her kids are the boss, because the state says so.
[00:02:35.286 --> 00:02:36.726]  So the state is the boss.
[00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:41.907]  This is right out of 1984, where, you know, the children are spies of the parents.
[00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:45.689]  Now, here is the clip.
[00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:46.369]  There's several of these.
[00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.290]  One of Glenn Beck's listeners recorded this of Al Gore at a school.
[00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:58.254]  And this is him telling the kids that basically their parents don't understand, but they as 11 and 12 year olds in this middle school, they do.
[00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:01.375]  Now again, it isn't about the environment, folks.
[00:03:01.395 --> 00:03:02.236]  It's about control.
[00:03:02.736 --> 00:03:06.978]  It's about bringing in global taxes to be paid to the new global central bank.
[00:03:07.098 --> 00:03:09.499]  Openly announced, as we told you for years, now public.
[00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:10.219]  We're right.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.460]  Here it is.
[00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:25.366]  But I'm thinking back now a long way to when I was your age, and the Civil Rights Revolution was unfolding.
[00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:41.772]  And we kids, as our parents, and their generation... Explain to me again why it's okay for the law to officially discriminate against people because of their skin color.
[00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.191]  And parents try to tell their kids the right thing, you know?
[00:03:48.171 --> 00:03:49.211]  Usually, I do.
[00:03:50.232 --> 00:04:02.335]  And when our parents' generation couldn't answer that question, that's when the laws started to change.
[00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:06.516]  There are... Yeah, let's go to the next part of the clip.
[00:04:07.476 --> 00:04:11.997]  There are some things about our world that you
[00:04:18.982 --> 00:04:19.782]  And it goes on and on.
[00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:22.203]  There's another clip we'll play later, and I'm going to comment on this more.
[00:04:22.223 --> 00:04:26.505]  But understand, folks, I just remembered this New York Times article today and pulled it up.
[00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:28.465]  There are hundreds in England.
[00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:34.588]  They're having them wear climate cop uniforms, black, white and red climate cops with a patch on the shoulder.
[00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.049]  And we've been to Obama rallies where they wear green uniforms with helmets.
[00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:40.670]  And they're going to come out and enforce all of this.
[00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:47.572]  Controlling every facet of your life, taxing and regulating, taxing farms, ranches, factories, businesses.
[00:04:48.192 --> 00:04:50.553]  They're gonna list carbon dioxide as a toxic waste.
[00:04:51.454 --> 00:04:52.494]  That's what plants breathe.
[00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:55.216]  I mean, this is going on.
[00:04:55.276 --> 00:05:01.059]  So you put your children in public school and most private schools, the state is taking them away from you on these petty power trips.
[00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.520]  And young people, they're just setting you up to be slaves.
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.561]  The state isn't your friend.
[00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:10.404]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.

[00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:01.141]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:05.122]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:07:22.145 --> 00:07:32.487]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:07:32.847 --> 00:07:38.388]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:44.669]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[00:08:08.574 --> 00:08:10.814]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:11.334 --> 00:08:14.155]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.812 --> 00:08:20.854]  You know, this radio show is not normally about Earth changes.
[00:08:21.094 --> 00:08:25.375]  We cover political news, socio-economic developments, things of that nature.
[00:08:25.916 --> 00:08:34.599]  Some people in this genre, alternative media, love the fear-monger about asteroids hitting the Earth and killing everybody or wiping out most of civilization.
[00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:38.861]  They love to freak out about tsunamis and earthquakes, and certainly that's a big problem.
[00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:40.482]  We happen to be in one of the areas affected by it.
[00:08:41.022 --> 00:08:45.964]  Hundreds of thousands of people every few years get killed by violent Earth changes.
[00:08:46.964 --> 00:08:57.854]  But that said, when I get into the fact that the supervolcano in Yellowstone Park, that's the epicenter of it,
[00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:00.860]  is a very, very serious issue.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.922]  It's because I'm reading what the seismologist, the volcanologist, and other people that study this are saying.
[00:09:07.502 --> 00:09:14.504]  And I remember first reading about this a decade ago with a lot of big universities and researchers saying, this thing looks like it may be starting to get active again.
[00:09:14.844 --> 00:09:16.225]  That's why you have the geysers.
[00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:17.465]  That's why you have the mud pits.
[00:09:18.705 --> 00:09:24.888]  And if it ever erupted, it could kill hundreds of thousands, millions of people, depending on which direction it explodes.
[00:09:24.968 --> 00:09:25.988]  It could blast rock.
[00:09:26.388 --> 00:09:31.171]  You know, a third of the way across the country, shoot dust into the atmosphere, cooling the Earth's temperature for years.
[00:09:31.632 --> 00:09:35.574]  This is a super volcano, not your little standard ones like a Mount St.
[00:09:35.614 --> 00:09:35.914]  Helens.
[00:09:35.954 --> 00:09:40.177]  But instead of myself here commenting on this, we have a top volcanologist on.
[00:09:40.437 --> 00:09:45.421]  He's the director of the International Volcanic Research Center, based in Apache Junction, Arizona.
[00:09:45.821 --> 00:09:48.243]  And they have researchers that are members of the group worldwide.
[00:09:48.923 --> 00:09:56.186]  And one of the other reasons we have him on is that they've had hundreds of earthquakes there in the last year and in surrounding areas around Yellowstone.
[00:09:56.226 --> 00:09:58.127]  It's rising in some areas, falling in others.
[00:09:58.527 --> 00:10:02.789]  The magma chamber, we call it a baffle lift, is getting bigger.
[00:10:03.289 --> 00:10:04.470]  Recent Yellowstone quake,
[00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.011]  Swarm second most intense on record.
[00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:08.191]  That's AP.
[00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:09.771]  Yellowstone quakes died down.
[00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:11.912]  Officials seek to ease supervolcano fears.
[00:10:12.352 --> 00:10:16.593]  They even had fake evacuation warnings and people panicking.
[00:10:16.613 --> 00:10:18.454]  This is after 500 earthquakes, not 400.
[00:10:19.274 --> 00:10:21.475]  So we've got a top volcanologist.
[00:10:22.415 --> 00:10:35.181]  Dr. Robert B. Trombley on with us, PhD, to break down from his expert opinion and research exactly what is going on and studying the volcano himself physically.
[00:10:35.462 --> 00:10:37.122]  Sir, it's great to have you here with us.
[00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:39.263]  Well, thank you very much for having me on the show.
[00:10:39.364 --> 00:10:40.584]  Delighted to be here with you.
[00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:45.947]  I was listening to your interview talking about asteroids.
[00:10:46.287 --> 00:10:48.148]  I was originally trained as an astronomer.
[00:10:48.675 --> 00:10:51.256]  So I was very interested in that as well.
[00:10:51.316 --> 00:11:04.042]  But at any rate, first of all, for starters, relative to Yellowstone, there should not be any panic or fear amongst the populace at the moment.
[00:11:05.443 --> 00:11:16.848]  As of the 4th of February, the day before yesterday, the University of Utah seismic stations reported that the activity
[00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:39.300]  From January 9th to the 12th, where we had a secondary swarm of 35 earthquakes occurred near the northeast edge of the Yellowstone Caldera, which is about 10 miles north-northeast of the north end of the Yellowstone Lake Swarm.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.863]  And for those of you who do not know what a swarm is, it's basically
[00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:56.981]  Earthquakes that are closely spaced in time and area are termed swarms and are quite common mode of seismic energy release at the Yellowstone Caldera.
[00:11:58.021 --> 00:12:00.662]  From 1984 to 2008, there were 80 swarms documented at Yellowstone.
[00:12:00.682 --> 00:12:03.743]  But at the moment, actually this started on December 26th of 2008, the second largest
[00:12:15.555 --> 00:12:21.258]  Earthquake swarm at Yellowstone occurred in its history.
[00:12:21.978 --> 00:12:36.226]  It occurred beneath the north end of Yellowstone Lake and it has continued into January of 2009, but then subsided rather quickly in the activity on January 5th.
[00:12:37.886 --> 00:12:41.488]  So the lake swarm, actually in this case, consisted of 813
[00:12:43.467 --> 00:12:46.989]  Well-located earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 0.8 to 3.9.
[00:12:48.630 --> 00:13:10.463]  This sequence contained 19 earthquakes of greater than 3 magnitude, 141 events of greater than 2 but less than 3, and several of the greater than 3 swarm events were felt throughout the National Park and surrounding area.
[00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:18.434]  Now, as I said, that's quite a common occurrence at Yellowstone, and has been for a long, long time.
[00:13:19.335 --> 00:13:23.977]  It last erupted 740,000 years ago, I believe.
[00:13:24.397 --> 00:13:28.319]  Was that the Lava Creek eruption that ejected stuff all the way into the Pacific Ocean?
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.520]  Yes.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.881]  Yeah.
[00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:34.483]  And I believe it was 740,000 years ago, right?
[00:13:37.193 --> 00:13:38.974]  Or it was 610, I can't remember.
[00:13:38.994 --> 00:13:41.314]  630 is what the graphic says, but go ahead.
[00:13:41.434 --> 00:13:42.314]  Yeah, 630, that's it.
[00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:43.255]  That's right.
[00:13:44.455 --> 00:13:52.857]  So, it's only erupted three times in its entire history, but there is no, as I said, there's no real cause for alarm at the moment.
[00:13:53.517 --> 00:13:59.979]  In fact, the earthquake activity has subsided quite a bit of late.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.081]  So, but this is a common occurrence that occurs at
[00:14:07.452 --> 00:14:08.172]  at Yellowstone.
[00:14:08.212 --> 00:14:15.176]  Now, you also mentioned the growing, and that's called deformation, ground deformation.
[00:14:15.957 --> 00:14:31.845]  Through January of this year, the continuous ground positioning system data showed that much of the Yellowstone caldera continued moving upward, although at a lower rate than the past several years.
[00:14:33.126 --> 00:14:36.808]  The nearest GPS station to the swarm
[00:14:37.515 --> 00:14:50.641]  At a place called Lake Junction, which is about two kilometers from the swarm, has experienced a ground lift over the last 55 months of about approximately 18 centimeters.
[00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:52.942]  So it's really not too much.
[00:14:53.402 --> 00:15:00.245]  Okay, let me ask you this, because talking during the break, is there any danger of it erupting?
[00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:06.468]  And if it did erupt, what would happen looking at the last eruptions?
[00:15:07.327 --> 00:15:13.551]  Okay, first of all, no, there's no real danger of it erupting at the moment.
[00:15:15.052 --> 00:15:23.497]  My normal take on this is it would not probably be erupting for several hundred or even thousands of years from now.
[00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:35.465]  The reason basically is because of all of the activity that's going on, the swarming, the geysers, this is all part of an energy release.
[00:15:36.397 --> 00:15:47.105]  And when you're releasing energy, even though it's not major bits of energy, it's still relieving the pressure, so to speak, on the volcano.
[00:15:47.386 --> 00:15:59.335]  But in a scale of 630,000 years from the last one, you're saying in the next few decades, next hundred years, next thousand, is it though, you believe from the evidence, entering into the cycle of eruption?
[00:16:01.536 --> 00:16:04.719]  It could be, but there's no real indication of that at the moment.
[00:16:04.819 --> 00:16:05.580]  I mean, it's not
[00:16:06.853 --> 00:16:09.002]  It's not acting up in the
[00:16:09.622 --> 00:16:16.224]  You had told me off air, I believe you were saying 61% with the computers though, that it will erupt, but I guess you mean the next... No, no, that was readout.
[00:16:16.824 --> 00:16:17.224]  Readout, okay.
[00:16:17.244 --> 00:16:18.285]  That was readout in Alaska.
[00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:20.745]  Oh, yeah, well let's talk about that one in a moment.
[00:16:20.765 --> 00:16:21.585]  Okay.
[00:16:21.766 --> 00:16:24.026]  Now, this is a super volcano, correct?
[00:16:24.286 --> 00:16:24.706]  Correct.
[00:16:25.227 --> 00:16:31.368]  Can you tell us the difference between this and, say, the Mount Redoubt in Alaska?
[00:16:31.528 --> 00:16:31.748]  Yes.
[00:16:31.848 --> 00:16:36.930]  First of all, the Yellowstone caldera is about 32 miles long and about 8 miles wide.
[00:16:38.475 --> 00:16:40.957]  That's how big it is, in reality.
[00:16:41.778 --> 00:16:48.023]  We normally, well let me put it in the simplest terms as possible.
[00:16:48.523 --> 00:16:55.268]  We have in our business a scale called VEI, which means Volcano Explosive Index.
[00:16:56.209 --> 00:16:57.870]  It runs on a scale of 0 to 8.
[00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:04.835]  0 being the lowest, 8 being the highest, and it's a measure of the amount of ash and
[00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:23.379]  So for starters, it's logarithmic, which means that as you go up on the scale, it means it's 10 times more material output from the volcano than the previous one.
[00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:25.040]  For example... Exponential!
[00:17:25.721 --> 00:17:26.001]  Yes.
[00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:32.506]  A VEI of 2 is 10 times more material output than a VEI of 1.
[00:17:32.566 --> 00:17:34.228]  So it's like the Richter scale.
[00:17:34.728 --> 00:17:34.968]  Yes.
[00:17:37.481 --> 00:17:40.663]  Yes, very much like the Richter Scale on a scale of 10, that's right.
[00:17:41.103 --> 00:17:52.327]  Now just to give you some perspective, Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano, which is erupting right now, is usually at a 0, a 1, and occasionally a 2.
[00:17:52.787 --> 00:17:55.388]  It's a very effusive type lava.
[00:17:56.709 --> 00:17:57.249]  Mount St.
[00:17:57.289 --> 00:18:00.750]  Helens, that most people are familiar with, that erupted in 1980, that was a 5 on our scale.
[00:18:03.911 --> 00:18:07.632]  Now, there has never been, in recorded history, an 8 eruption.
[00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:15.794]  But the last one occurred 76,000 years ago in Toba, in Sumatra.
[00:18:16.974 --> 00:18:32.718]  But that type of an eruption of a supervolcano, which is a VEI of 8, and again, there's never been one in recorded history per se, that could cause, if it went completely catastrophic, it could cause us into another ice age.
[00:18:34.286 --> 00:18:35.769]  So it would have global effects.
[00:18:37.132 --> 00:18:44.086]  But again, that's not even showing any signs whatsoever at Yellowstone at the moment.
[00:18:45.126 --> 00:18:59.278]  Okay, but on the scale then, this would be thousands of times bigger eruption than what we see with lava just pouring out and covering some jungle, some tropic forest in something like what's happening in Hawaii.
[00:18:59.618 --> 00:19:00.879]  And even compared to Mount St.
[00:19:00.919 --> 00:19:05.003]  Helens, we're talking hundreds or thousands of times bigger?
[00:19:06.183 --> 00:19:11.108]  Well, it would be thousands of times bigger if it erupted catastrophically full scale.
[00:19:11.208 --> 00:19:13.550]  And that means exploding from the pressure building up like St.
[00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:13.850]  Helens?
[00:19:14.502 --> 00:19:16.562]  Yes, yes.
[00:19:16.843 --> 00:19:19.343]  Now, what are the three types of volcanoes?
[00:19:19.383 --> 00:19:22.784]  Because you have the big explosive ones that shoot all the ash and rock.
[00:19:22.804 --> 00:19:26.125]  Those have a different name, don't they, than one that just oozes the lava?
[00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:29.746]  Yeah, we have basically three types of volcanoes.
[00:19:30.886 --> 00:19:36.067]  Actually, we have 14, but the three most common are strato or composite volcanoes.
[00:19:36.107 --> 00:19:38.548]  These are volcanoes like Mount St.
[00:19:38.588 --> 00:19:40.668]  Helens and so forth.
[00:19:41.508 --> 00:19:44.089]  We also have what are called hotspot volcanoes.
[00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:46.752]  That would be like, uh, Kilauea.
[00:19:47.272 --> 00:19:57.059]  A hotspot volcano, the simplest explanation for that is if you could imagine yourself being inside of a basketball, uh, with a hot poker and sticking it from the inside out.
[00:19:57.419 --> 00:19:58.340]  Stay there, we gotta break.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.681]  This is riveting information.
[00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:06.065]  We have a top volcanologist on the line with us, breaking down all this increase in volcanic activity worldwide and what it may mean.
[00:20:08.931 --> 00:20:09.652]  Stop wasting your
[00:20:27.486 --> 00:20:27.766]  I'm good.
[00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.630]  I'm good.
[00:21:07.685 --> 00:21:14.048]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:14.429 --> 00:21:16.410]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.091]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:18.631 --> 00:21:19.131]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:20.232]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:20.252 --> 00:21:21.713]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:21.793 --> 00:21:23.454]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:23.774 --> 00:21:30.517]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:30.938 --> 00:21:31.358]  Some U.S.
[00:21:31.418 --> 00:21:37.081]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:37.741 --> 00:21:41.202]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:41.222 --> 00:21:43.223]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.

[00:24:11.423 --> 00:24:12.724]  Robert R.B.
[00:24:12.905 --> 00:24:23.473]  Trombley, PhD, is the founder and principal research volcanologist at the SWVRC, and is a registered volcanologist with the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry for the Earth's interior.
[00:24:23.493 --> 00:24:26.875]  He's an award-winning scientist and has traveled all over the world working on volcanoes.
[00:24:27.356 --> 00:24:30.558]  Dr. Trombley is also affiliated with many other volcanology associations.
[00:24:30.918 --> 00:24:39.425]  He is the principal designer of the highly successful software program called EruptionPro 10.5, which provides long-term range forecasts for volcanic eruptions all over the world.
[00:24:39.605 --> 00:24:43.686]  One of the top volcano eruption experts out there in the world.
[00:24:43.706 --> 00:24:46.387]  We're very, very honored to have him.
[00:24:46.427 --> 00:24:49.007]  I had misplaced his bio at the beginning of the show as we went back over that.
[00:24:49.467 --> 00:25:01.870]  Okay, this is a short segment, a long one coming up next, the final segment with you, but let's get right back into the three types of volcanoes and these very low explosive types that you were talking about that are just oozing, versus the Mount St.
[00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.311]  Helens that is so explosive, and then the other type.
[00:25:04.331 --> 00:25:04.851]  Please continue.
[00:25:05.273 --> 00:25:05.853]  Yeah, sure.
[00:25:08.154 --> 00:25:10.194]  We started with the composite and stratos.
[00:25:10.234 --> 00:25:11.674]  Those are like the Mount St.
[00:25:11.694 --> 00:25:13.475]  Helens and so forth.
[00:25:13.535 --> 00:25:16.615]  And those are usually the more explosive type volcanoes.
[00:25:17.435 --> 00:25:23.797]  A hotspot volcano such as Kilauea is a relatively, what we call, effusive output.
[00:25:23.817 --> 00:25:25.877]  It's just a flowing of lava and so forth.
[00:25:25.937 --> 00:25:30.858]  And the third most common type of volcano is called a cinder cone.
[00:25:31.563 --> 00:25:41.031]  And the reason it's called that is because the output of the volcano is very much like the cinders you see on a gravel driveway, for example.
[00:25:41.071 --> 00:25:44.994]  They normally don't explode more than once or twice in their lifetime.
[00:25:45.414 --> 00:25:48.597]  That's the classic ones we see in dinosaur paintings or in the Flintstones.
[00:25:49.017 --> 00:25:50.919]  Yes, that's right.
[00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:59.466]  And by the way, your listeners can check out all the latest eruptions that we have all over the world right now on our website.
[00:26:00.396 --> 00:26:07.420]  Which is www.intlvrc.org.
[00:26:09.261 --> 00:26:14.724]  And we'll put that up on screen for folks as we're also simulcasting the radio show via television.
[00:26:16.065 --> 00:26:24.089]  Doctor, is overall volcanic activity increasing right now or are we in an uptick in the cycle just from watching the news?
[00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.411]  It seems like there's a lot more eruptions going on right now.
[00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:30.065]  No, that's somewhat of an illusion.
[00:26:30.285 --> 00:26:33.546]  We normally have about 40 to 60 eruptions a year.
[00:26:35.707 --> 00:26:42.569]  The reason that it appears that way is because of the technology and the mass media we have now.
[00:26:42.629 --> 00:26:50.272]  I mean, you know, 10, 15 years ago, a lot of people didn't even know an eruption went off, except those of us in the business.
[00:26:51.016 --> 00:26:54.638]  And sometimes we get that three, four weeks later, even longer.
[00:26:55.279 --> 00:27:08.907]  Now, it's almost, if an eruption goes off anywhere in the world, including in the oceans and so forth, like on islands, I mean, in the oceans and stuff like that, we know about it within minutes.
[00:27:09.247 --> 00:27:13.970]  How many other super volcanoes are there that are somewhat active that aren't dormant?
[00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:18.893]  Well, first of all, they're all dormant at the moment, fortunately.
[00:27:19.874 --> 00:27:22.377]  Not extinct, but dormant, which means they're just sleeping.
[00:27:22.737 --> 00:27:24.899]  There's about two or three of them.
[00:27:25.099 --> 00:27:32.565]  Yellowstone is one, the one in Sumatra, Toba, and another one in New Zealand called Tapo.
[00:27:33.406 --> 00:27:34.267]  Any undersea ones?
[00:27:34.307 --> 00:27:38.410]  I would imagine that long run... Not supervolcanoes that we know of at the moment.
[00:27:38.511 --> 00:27:42.294]  There's lots of volcanoes under the ocean, but none of them are supervolcanoes.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.481]  So this would be thousands of times what Mount St.
[00:27:46.801 --> 00:27:47.661]  Helens was.
[00:27:48.061 --> 00:27:49.362]  Why are people panicking?
[00:27:49.402 --> 00:27:50.842]  Why are some people moving out of the area?
[00:27:50.882 --> 00:27:54.963]  Why are they having false alerts if this is just part of a normal cycle?
[00:27:56.384 --> 00:28:06.347]  Well, I don't really know why the fear factor is in there, but it could be tied to a few things.
[00:28:06.427 --> 00:28:13.429]  Number one, they had a movie, kind of a semi-documentary on Yellowstone eruption not too long ago.
[00:28:14.301 --> 00:28:14.401]  Yeah.
[00:28:27.285 --> 00:28:27.965]  And so forth.
[00:28:28.005 --> 00:28:44.472]  Could it be that earthquakes have been killing more people and they saw the big tsunami and folks are realizing this is a planet that's always changing and I hear terms like we've got to stop climate change but the climate's always changing and I've read that volcanoes put out a lot more CO2 and other greenhouse gases than humans ever ever could.
[00:28:44.492 --> 00:28:56.377]  That's true that volcanoes do put out a lot of different kinds of gases and so forth but there I would say overall that the contribution of volcanoes to climate
[00:28:57.922 --> 00:29:01.385]  Global warming and so on is somewhat minor.
[00:29:02.927 --> 00:29:10.494]  I think more damage is done by human stuff that you hear about all the time.
[00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:11.155]  Really?
[00:29:11.215 --> 00:29:12.036]  Humans?
[00:29:12.616 --> 00:29:20.965]  I mean, the ocean's full of CO2 and I've seen the charts just thousands of times what human activity is, but I mean, I guess that's just another issue.
[00:29:21.952 --> 00:29:22.493]  Yes, it is.
[00:29:22.653 --> 00:29:30.980]  You know, I do believe in global warming and so forth, but I don't think the volcanoes have... I shouldn't say they don't have anything to do with it.
[00:29:31.301 --> 00:29:37.146]  They have a very minor place in the... I mean, my issue is, I thought the sun was most of climate.
[00:29:37.186 --> 00:29:41.310]  I mean, the ice caps on Mars were getting smaller, now they're getting bigger because things cooled off.
[00:29:42.293 --> 00:29:45.055]  No, that's a normal cycle on Mars.
[00:29:45.635 --> 00:29:45.875]  Yeah.
[00:29:45.895 --> 00:29:48.637]  Ice caps waning and waxing as they were.
[00:29:48.657 --> 00:29:52.499]  See, I thought it was a normal cycle here, too, because we see it all over the solar system.
[00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:55.881]  But let's get back into volcanoes, sir, in a final segment straight ahead.
[00:29:58.042 --> 00:29:58.963]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.443 --> 00:30:01.044]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.964 --> 00:30:04.646]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.634 --> 00:30:17.382]  SouthSummit.com is the place for top name brand knives such as Kershaw, Spyderco, Cold Steel, Gerber, K-Bar, Boker, Leatherman, and more.
[00:30:17.542 --> 00:30:21.505]  South Summit has one of the largest selections of self-defense products on the web.
[00:30:21.645 --> 00:30:31.473]  Knives, stun guns, police batons, pepper spray, LED flashlights, emergency kits, binoculars, and tactical gear are just some of the great products found on SouthSummit.com.
[00:30:31.533 --> 00:30:35.776]  Receive discounted prices on camping and preparedness products from Camelbak, Kelty, and your
[00:30:35.796 --> 00:30:36.576]  We're good to go.
[00:30:57.041 --> 00:31:00.023]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:31:00.243 --> 00:31:00.824]  And we knew what to do.
[00:31:00.844 --> 00:31:01.864]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:31:01.964 --> 00:31:05.707]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:31:05.787 --> 00:31:06.487]  Whitman.
[00:31:06.507 --> 00:31:06.888]  EPA.
[00:31:26.653 --> 00:31:32.516]  The director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:31:32.856 --> 00:31:39.639]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:31:39.959 --> 00:31:43.020]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.303]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:31:48.883 --> 00:31:51.444]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:31:51.963 --> 00:31:57.807]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:31:58.007 --> 00:32:00.548]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:32:00.929 --> 00:32:05.952]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:32:08.313 --> 00:32:09.454]  Hi, this is Steve Shanks.
[00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:20.710]  We're good to go!
[00:32:49.121 --> 00:32:49.461]  I think so.
[00:33:19.662 --> 00:33:31.967]  Robert Trumbly, Ph.D., Doctor of Volcanology, is our guest, and we get a lot of calls about the Yellowstone, all these hundreds of earthquakes.
[00:33:33.608 --> 00:33:35.269]  Briefly, what's happening up in Alaska?
[00:33:35.929 --> 00:33:38.190]  You're saying it's a probability that that is going to erupt?
[00:33:39.847 --> 00:33:52.291]  Yeah, as of today, the Alaska Volcano Observatory has reported that the Redoubt Volcano continues seismic activity and it's continued unrest.
[00:33:53.811 --> 00:34:02.013]  The seismic activity is remaining at elevated and is steady and is well above the background level at the moment.
[00:34:02.133 --> 00:34:07.295]  However, the overall level of the seismic activity has declined somewhat
[00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:21.239]  Over the last 24 hours, as a matter of fact, we do have webcams and satellite images from this volcano, and this morning have been somewhat obscured by the clouds.
[00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:30.764]  But at any rate, the melting of the glacier has produced a 200-mile hole, which is emitting gases.
[00:34:31.504 --> 00:34:36.427]  In fact, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued a temporary flight restriction
[00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.092]  And what type of volcano is this?
[00:34:39.112 --> 00:34:40.473]  How big will the eruption be?
[00:35:06.943 --> 00:35:09.144]  Well, we don't know how big the eruption will be.
[00:35:09.204 --> 00:35:14.327]  We never know that, but it is a strato-type volcano.
[00:35:14.347 --> 00:35:26.094]  Most of your stratovolcanoes lie along plate margins, so that's what kind of volcano that is.
[00:35:29.605 --> 00:35:42.113]  I know you don't really study hydrogen bombs, but there were some debates about if there was ever, you know, nuclear testing causing earthquakes and some evidence that it was triggering seismic activity around the world and kind of a domino effect.
[00:35:42.413 --> 00:35:48.516]  I wonder what would happen if a hydrogen bomb went off over Yellowstone or right in the middle of the caldera.
[00:35:49.297 --> 00:35:50.998]  Could that open up a fissure?
[00:35:51.498 --> 00:35:55.461]  I mean, we know the Earth's a bunch of tectonic plates floating around on molten magma.
[00:35:55.981 --> 00:35:58.923]  I'm just curious, because there are a lot of military bases based out there and things.
[00:36:00.598 --> 00:36:01.999]  I suppose it could, yes.
[00:36:02.179 --> 00:36:08.524]  And the reason I'm somewhat laughing is because we get all kinds of questions on our website.
[00:36:08.564 --> 00:36:11.286]  We have an email address that people can write in questions.
[00:36:11.346 --> 00:36:19.852]  Every once in a while, we had one guy a couple years ago want to know if we could plant bombs in Yellowstone to relieve the pressure and so forth.
[00:36:21.834 --> 00:36:23.515]  So that's not going to happen.
[00:36:24.455 --> 00:36:27.378]  But sure, any type of bomb could.
[00:36:29.164 --> 00:36:33.308]  Could cause a rupture in the magma chamber and so forth.
[00:36:34.028 --> 00:36:38.512]  In fact, there's a very famous story about World War II in Italy.
[00:36:38.632 --> 00:36:45.178]  Bomber pilots and fighter pilots used to drop their unspent bombs supposedly in Vesuvius.
[00:36:45.759 --> 00:36:48.201]  And that's what caused it to erupt last time in 1944.
[00:36:51.727 --> 00:36:56.031]  So, that never really did happen, but that's what all the Italian people used to say.
[00:36:56.071 --> 00:37:00.456]  The reason the volcano erupted is because pilots were dropping their bombs in the volcano.
[00:37:01.657 --> 00:37:02.338]  Yes, that's Pompeii.
[00:37:09.622 --> 00:37:10.383]  Killed quite a few.
[00:37:10.423 --> 00:37:12.865]  Alright, well as things develop, we'd like to have you back up, sir.
[00:37:13.266 --> 00:37:16.969]  Fire off that website again for folks who want to learn more about volcanic activity worldwide.
[00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:20.213]  Yeah, our website is www.intlvrc.org.
[00:37:25.655 --> 00:37:31.960]  All right, so intlvrc.org, the International Volcanic Research Center.
[00:37:32.901 --> 00:37:34.443]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, Doctor.
[00:37:34.523 --> 00:37:35.904]  And thank you for having us on.
[00:37:36.224 --> 00:37:36.584]  Thank you.
[00:37:36.604 --> 00:37:36.905]  Anytime.
[00:37:37.265 --> 00:37:37.625]  You bet.
[00:37:38.386 --> 00:37:40.248]  Okay, that ran a little bit over, but...
[00:37:41.252 --> 00:37:46.396]  It's important information, so we covered it there for you to try to answer some of the listeners' questions, at least from his perspective.
[00:37:47.476 --> 00:37:55.422]  Now, for the balance of this hour, maybe a little bit in the next hour, then Jason Burmas will be with us on PrisonPlanet.tv, simulcasting via video cam from upstate New York.
[00:37:55.942 --> 00:38:00.565]  Aaron Zellman, with one of the only real pro-Second Amendment groups in this country.
[00:38:00.585 --> 00:38:07.590]  We've had Larry Pratt with his hundreds of thousands of members and Gunners of America come on and tell you and read the quotes and documents.
[00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:10.632]  The NRA was founded as a gun control organization.
[00:38:11.991 --> 00:38:15.915]  That it helped pass the 68 Gun Control Act and others before that.
[00:38:15.955 --> 00:38:16.795]  It's a judoscope.
[00:38:17.336 --> 00:38:24.743]  And they've introduced a bunch of bills to psychologically test, to make you become federally licensed, to get all of your psychological records.
[00:38:26.925 --> 00:38:27.565]  We now have...
[00:38:28.923 --> 00:38:45.164]  Excuse me, we now have the Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, saying that they want to have a blacklist, the million plus people now on the no-fly list, that without ever charging you or even letting you know, that they will just put people they don't like on the list so you can't own guns.
[00:38:46.323 --> 00:38:49.325]  They're saying they're going to use the threat of terrorism as a way to sell this.
[00:38:49.725 --> 00:39:02.331]  They've introduced bills to allow the Attorney General through Executive Fiat to ban any semi-automatics he wishes at any time, or any gun that has something they don't like, not just semi-auto, the way it's written.
[00:39:02.351 --> 00:39:03.792]  And these things are getting co-sponsored.
[00:39:03.832 --> 00:39:04.933]  This is rushing forward.
[00:39:05.613 --> 00:39:06.333]  This is happening.
[00:39:06.373 --> 00:39:10.876]  We look at Obama's voting record, Rahm Emanuel's voting record in the House and Senate.
[00:39:11.136 --> 00:39:13.337]  They believe reasonable gun control is D.C.
[00:39:13.397 --> 00:39:13.937]  total ban.
[00:39:14.257 --> 00:39:14.998]  Chicago ban.
[00:39:15.942 --> 00:39:28.252]  So I wanted to get the Director of Jews and Preservation Firearms ownership, Aaron Zellman, on with us to get his response to this because in the past the establishment came out and tried to push gun control and sell it.
[00:39:28.592 --> 00:39:31.235]  They've been losing that battle to the hearts and minds of all the polls.
[00:39:31.655 --> 00:39:37.720]  So now they're trying to shut down manufacturers, harass gun dealers, shut down gun shows, make everybody register.
[00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:42.624]  Now they are just not trumpeting their attack, they're just doing it.
[00:39:42.724 --> 00:39:43.344]  Aaron Zellman,
[00:39:44.065 --> 00:39:44.946]  Good to have you on with us.
[00:39:44.966 --> 00:39:48.128]  Please give us a report about the dire situation the Second Amendment's in.
[00:39:48.828 --> 00:39:49.749]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:52.651]  Well, you are right about a dire situation.
[00:39:52.711 --> 00:40:00.336]  We are faced with a war, literally a war, a war on gun owners waged by the government.
[00:40:01.537 --> 00:40:08.822]  It's a mission that, I guess you could call it the United States government's final solution to the Second Amendment.
[00:40:08.842 --> 00:40:10.323]  I'm not trying to be funny with words.
[00:40:11.212 --> 00:40:15.794]  But that's how serious the situation is with these folks that are now in charge.
[00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:22.097]  And I would like to add every gun owner who voted for the Obama administration, I think they're too damn stupid to own a gun.
[00:40:22.117 --> 00:40:25.658]  They should give it to someone who appreciates the Second Amendment.
[00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:28.780]  But with that said, let's go forward.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.881]  No, you're right.
[00:40:30.901 --> 00:40:32.221]  And Larry Pratt is right, too.
[00:40:32.261 --> 00:40:37.003]  We are, I think, being sold out by the NRA, quite frankly.
[00:40:37.023 --> 00:40:40.265]  I mean, we've been telling people for a long time that the NRA
[00:40:41.617 --> 00:40:48.022]  Uh, wrote a letter to one of our members saying they did not want to abolish the ATF.
[00:40:48.922 --> 00:40:51.684]  The ATF is the arch enemy of the Second Amendment.
[00:40:51.724 --> 00:40:58.489]  The ATF will take its jack-booted marching orders from the Obama administration to destroy the Second Amendment.
[00:40:58.849 --> 00:40:59.670]  Well, look at Holder!
[00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:00.350]  Look at Holder!
[00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.071]  He wants a total gun ban.
[00:41:02.111 --> 00:41:05.094]  He argued before the Supreme Court for the D.C.
[00:41:05.134 --> 00:41:05.534]  gun ban.
[00:41:07.082 --> 00:41:07.822]  Well, that's correct.
[00:41:07.923 --> 00:41:08.243]  That's right.
[00:41:08.263 --> 00:41:09.483]  Well, let me just finish this one.
[00:41:09.503 --> 00:41:10.104]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:41:10.424 --> 00:41:15.607]  If someone is doubtful of what I'm saying, they can go to our website, JPFO.org.
[00:41:15.647 --> 00:41:18.609]  They can look at the letter the NRA wrote to one of our members.
[00:41:19.129 --> 00:41:21.591]  They get very clear they don't want to abolish the ATF.
[00:41:22.571 --> 00:41:24.612]  So I think people need to understand that.
[00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:28.555]  That we have more than just enemies within the White House.
[00:41:31.394 --> 00:41:33.355]  Yeah, we don't just have enemies without the game.
[00:41:33.776 --> 00:41:34.376]  Pardon me?
[00:41:34.997 --> 00:41:36.237]  We have enemies within and without.
[00:41:36.578 --> 00:41:36.918]  Go ahead.
[00:41:38.219 --> 00:41:39.280]  That's a good way to put it.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:46.044]  So I think, so anyway, I think that the, uh, the, uh, I'm glad to tell you we're working on a project.
[00:41:46.665 --> 00:42:00.895]  I can't talk a lot about it now, but it hopefully if gun owners will use it, it will put the Obama administration on the defensive and it will raise the ire of millions and millions of people who have a vested interest in firearms ownership.
[00:42:01.511 --> 00:42:02.532]  And get them motivated.
[00:42:02.572 --> 00:42:04.834]  We'll give them the intellectual ammunition they need.
[00:42:05.394 --> 00:42:07.936]  But it's going to be at least 60 days before we have that out.
[00:42:08.476 --> 00:42:12.720]  Alright, let's go over... I mean, I've analyzed these bills last week and this week on air.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.382]  But let's go over the armada.
[00:42:16.062 --> 00:42:19.045]  Each one of these makes the Sullivan's ban look tame.
[00:42:19.385 --> 00:42:22.547]  I mean, national registration, licensing, your psychological records.
[00:42:23.228 --> 00:42:26.490]  By Fiat, the Attorney General banning whatever guns he wants.
[00:42:27.751 --> 00:42:30.794]  You know, shutting down gun shows, shutting down private transfer.
[00:42:32.068 --> 00:42:34.769]  I mean, I have never seen anything like this.
[00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:38.950]  This is the full-on assault and it's like you hear crickets.
[00:42:41.171 --> 00:42:45.953]  Well, I think that first of all we have to keep an eye on which of these bills actually gets out of committee.
[00:42:47.593 --> 00:42:49.374]  That's important that people realize that.
[00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:52.335]  To keep an eye on if the bill gets out of committee.
[00:42:53.896 --> 00:43:00.358]  There are people in the Congress who realize that gun control is a great way for them to lose an election.
[00:43:01.548 --> 00:43:03.849]  And that might put a damper on some of this nonsense.
[00:43:04.369 --> 00:43:05.950]  But it's dangerous because it's there.
[00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:18.734]  And the other danger, quite frankly, is that the Obama administration will create some kind of must-pass legislation, and then some amendments will be tacked onto it.
[00:43:18.994 --> 00:43:19.354]  Poor girl.
[00:43:19.414 --> 00:43:21.295]  I think to destroy the Second Amendment.
[00:43:21.595 --> 00:43:21.855]  Yes.
[00:43:22.595 --> 00:43:24.896]  I mean, that's what we're dealing with here.
[00:43:25.496 --> 00:43:27.657]  It's beyond just watching it come out of committee.
[00:43:28.357 --> 00:43:30.998]  So we really are dealing with some
[00:43:31.736 --> 00:43:41.069]  A dangerous fascist who do not want the American people to defend themselves against the ever-growing government.
[00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.673]  Let's be clear about this and I want to get your take on it.
[00:43:46.681 --> 00:43:48.062]  Let me just boil it down and make it simple.
[00:43:48.563 --> 00:43:55.710]  These are prominent members of the House reintroducing legislation that the Chief of Staff, now the White House, Rahm Emanuel, originally introduced.
[00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:59.113]  These things have got a lot of political power.
[00:43:59.193 --> 00:44:03.917]  They're just waiting for some shooting or something they stage to allow this to carry out.
[00:44:04.818 --> 00:44:10.524]  And they're saying they want to use the anti-terror apparatus they've built up, the phony war on terror, against the Second Amendment.
[00:44:10.544 --> 00:44:11.545]  So my point is,
[00:44:12.751 --> 00:44:16.412]  These bills let us know the Obamanoids intention.
[00:44:16.612 --> 00:44:22.473]  So can you speak to that and then speak to the record of Obama, of Emanuel, and of Holder and others?
[00:44:24.014 --> 00:44:28.455]  Well, first of all, I think their intentions are very clear that they don't want people to be armed.
[00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:40.178]  I think that you will see a, I guess you would call it, a red flag operation where military pattern weapons are used to justify calling for a ban.
[00:44:41.298 --> 00:44:48.064]  And I wouldn't put it past the ATF or other groups like that to stage that type of an operation.
[00:44:48.544 --> 00:44:50.385]  They don't really care if human beings are killed.
[00:44:50.445 --> 00:44:53.688]  It's really not a high priority to them.
[00:44:54.929 --> 00:44:56.470]  Obama comes from Illinois.
[00:44:56.811 --> 00:44:58.192]  Emanuel comes from Illinois.
[00:44:58.232 --> 00:45:02.195]  And they are great fans of banning guns outright, of taxing.
[00:45:02.215 --> 00:45:06.398]  They have a long history of wanting to destroy gun ownership.
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.940]  And they really are...
[00:45:10.322 --> 00:45:12.283]  Well, they're dishonest in many ways.
[00:45:12.363 --> 00:45:13.504]  One of them morally bankrupt.
[00:45:13.524 --> 00:45:20.547]  The other is that they are intellectually dishonest because they claim that the crime is the reason they want to ban guns.
[00:45:20.567 --> 00:45:23.749]  But they don't take a look at what they don't admit is the cause of the crime.
[00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:28.051]  And I think in many instances, it's what I would call the narco economy.
[00:45:29.212 --> 00:45:32.874]  It is the war on drugs that is creating
[00:45:33.781 --> 00:45:35.603]  The violence, the crime.
[00:45:53.237 --> 00:45:57.599]  Because the cartels are battling with the government that's been caught dealing drugs a million times.
[00:45:57.859 --> 00:46:02.120]  So it's a drug war, but the only real drug war is the drug dealers fighting with each other.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.761]  So you're absolutely right.
[00:46:03.781 --> 00:46:06.602]  And look at the places where we have the narco-terrorists.
[00:46:06.622 --> 00:46:09.083]  Chicago, New York, places like that.
[00:46:09.443 --> 00:46:14.165]  Most of these children dying we hear about in the news are gangbanger numbers of them shooting each other.
[00:46:14.185 --> 00:46:15.225]  So I was just backing you up.
[00:46:15.285 --> 00:46:15.965]  Please continue.
[00:46:16.465 --> 00:46:20.787]  Yeah, in other words, when you talk about the inner city, usually this is populated by black people.
[00:46:21.676 --> 00:46:30.603]  And probably 80% of the crime there is black-on-black crime, and most of it's related to a fighting over turf or a deal gone bad or whatever.
[00:46:31.644 --> 00:46:39.690]  And so, this is something that I don't think that Eric Holder has the moral decency to acknowledge the truth.
[00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:46.655]  Obama certainly doesn't have the moral decency to acknowledge the truth of what the problem is.
[00:46:46.675 --> 00:46:49.337]  And I think that makes him very dangerous.
[00:46:50.134 --> 00:46:55.438]  But perhaps these guys are more dangerous in some respect than we believe, because who's really behind them?
[00:46:56.078 --> 00:46:59.701]  To me, these two guys are puppets, and their strings are being pulled.
[00:47:00.061 --> 00:47:01.242]  So who's pulling the strings?
[00:47:02.263 --> 00:47:11.330]  Wall Street has just hijacked the nation, stolen trillions, is taking over everything, and they don't want armed people they're about to rob.
[00:47:12.411 --> 00:47:13.191]  Oh no, not at all.
[00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:20.252]  It's not just Wall Street that's planning to rob somebody, or at the direction of the government.
[00:47:21.032 --> 00:47:25.453]  I think that the tax situation in America has gotten out of hand, and many other issues.
[00:47:26.914 --> 00:47:34.237]  When the government can tell you how many gallons of water you can have in your toilet when it flushes, then I think they've really invaded your privacy.
[00:47:35.037 --> 00:47:41.279]  And that may sound silly, but you look at every single area of our life,
[00:47:42.168 --> 00:47:46.370]  And there's government involvement in trying to take more and more of your freedom.
[00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.011]  So it isn't just Wall Street that's robbing us.
[00:47:50.451 --> 00:47:53.072]  It is the government that's robbing us at every level.
[00:47:53.352 --> 00:47:53.912]  No, you're right.
[00:47:53.952 --> 00:47:55.333]  I mean, Wall Street's becoming the government.
[00:47:55.453 --> 00:47:55.953]  And you're right.
[00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.274]  What type of lightbulb?
[00:47:57.334 --> 00:47:58.294]  What type of toilet?
[00:47:58.574 --> 00:47:59.574]  What type of car?
[00:47:59.975 --> 00:48:00.955]  Training the children.
[00:48:00.995 --> 00:48:02.495]  Going in and saying, your parents are dumb.
[00:48:02.556 --> 00:48:03.536]  Global warming's real.
[00:48:03.816 --> 00:48:05.096]  We gotta have a tax for it.
[00:48:05.417 --> 00:48:07.897]  I mean, this is what we saw in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia.
[00:48:07.978 --> 00:48:11.619]  It's classic that Americans can't believe it's really happening.
[00:48:12.438 --> 00:48:20.141]  You know, one thing that everyone knows but they're not thinking about as clearly is that it was bad financial times that brought the Nazis to power.
[00:48:22.002 --> 00:48:25.703]  And we're already seeing signs of extreme fascism in America.
[00:48:28.785 --> 00:48:30.565]  So, what's the battle plan, Aaron Zellman?
[00:48:31.626 --> 00:48:34.147]  Well, before we get into the battle plan, solutions in the next segment,
[00:48:34.946 --> 00:48:46.711]  You're always, you know, focusing on the way they're attacking extra judiciously or extra judicially outside the courts, outside law, harassing gun dealers, gun manufacturers.
[00:48:47.552 --> 00:48:49.312]  What are the boys in black doing right now?
[00:48:50.933 --> 00:48:52.874]  Well, they don't exactly call and tell me.
[00:48:54.435 --> 00:48:55.975]  But I know you track them.
[00:48:56.576 --> 00:49:01.578]  I think the first thing I would tell the American people is to start
[00:49:02.233 --> 00:49:09.759]  Be prepared for some type of a situation where military pattern weapons are used to create a massacre.
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.461]  Obama needs that.
[00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:16.084]  Eric Holder needs that to promote some gun control scheme.
[00:49:16.984 --> 00:49:22.729]  So I would suggest that people start to be on the lookout for it and to tell others to be on the lookout for it.
[00:49:23.416 --> 00:49:28.881]  That might be the best way to stop it, is when everyone's going to be suspicious of it and not trust it.
[00:49:29.361 --> 00:49:30.162]  Exactly.
[00:49:30.643 --> 00:49:31.163]  Elaborate.
[00:49:31.203 --> 00:49:34.906]  I was about to say, by us watching, we may be able to stop them.
[00:49:34.966 --> 00:49:35.407]  Police!
[00:49:37.249 --> 00:49:39.110]  Watch Feds when they're in your area.
[00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:39.611]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:49:40.431 --> 00:49:41.052]  Oh, you're right, Alex.
[00:49:41.072 --> 00:49:47.278]  In other words, we have to put on the magnifying glass, so to speak.
[00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:49.800]  We have to start looking at every single thing the Feds are doing.
[00:49:50.583 --> 00:49:55.927]  We have to reach out to other people we know and tell them to be on the lookout.
[00:49:56.347 --> 00:50:01.391]  Become extremely suspicious of every single thing the federal government is doing.
[00:50:01.971 --> 00:50:05.154]  And not just the federal government, your own state government, your city government.
[00:50:06.154 --> 00:50:09.337]  Because they are often pressured by the feds to do things.
[00:50:11.278 --> 00:50:13.760]  So I think that's step number one for a game plan, is it?
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:16.342]  We've got to get people to wake up, quite frankly.
[00:50:17.092 --> 00:50:20.574]  And to pay more attention to what's really going on around their lives.
[00:50:21.115 --> 00:50:28.119]  And they've become extremely suspicious when the government seems to want to take advantage of a situation.
[00:50:28.139 --> 00:50:34.203]  That's what they're doing now with the financial problems we're having.
[00:50:34.223 --> 00:50:35.504]  They're trying to take advantage of it.
[00:50:37.205 --> 00:50:38.406]  Emmanuel even said that.
[00:50:38.426 --> 00:50:39.887]  He said we're not going to waste a good crisis.
[00:50:40.973 --> 00:50:43.354]  Well, at least he's honest about that, right?
[00:50:43.694 --> 00:50:45.315]  You have to give the devil his due, right?
[00:50:46.035 --> 00:50:46.615]  Absolutely.
[00:50:46.675 --> 00:50:49.536]  Aaron Zellman, can you stay with us until about five after in the next hour?
[00:50:49.556 --> 00:50:50.456]  Sure, sure.
[00:50:50.736 --> 00:50:50.857]  Great.
[00:50:50.877 --> 00:50:53.577]  I want to be able to get some of these points flushed out.
[00:50:54.038 --> 00:50:56.699]  Join Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
[00:50:56.719 --> 00:50:57.459]  Anybody can join.
[00:50:57.759 --> 00:50:58.799]  JPFO.org.
[00:50:59.279 --> 00:51:02.481]  A great Second Amendment group out there, and we appreciate everything they're doing.
[00:51:03.001 --> 00:51:04.281]  We're in the fight of our lives.
[00:51:04.321 --> 00:51:04.901]  This is it.
[00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:06.142]  Toe to toe with the New World Order.
[00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:15.011]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[00:51:15.452 --> 00:51:17.212]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[00:51:17.752 --> 00:51:19.233]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:51:19.873 --> 00:51:23.454]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[00:51:23.874 --> 00:51:27.375]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[00:51:27.855 --> 00:51:31.596]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray you
[00:51:38.413 --> 00:51:38.813]  We're good to go.
[00:52:07.697 --> 00:52:14.081]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:14.461 --> 00:52:16.442]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:17.103 --> 00:52:18.123]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:18.644 --> 00:52:19.164]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:19.444 --> 00:52:20.365]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:20.385 --> 00:52:21.786]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:21.826 --> 00:52:23.467]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:30.551]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:30.951 --> 00:52:31.391]  Some U.S.
[00:52:31.431 --> 00:52:37.115]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:37.775 --> 00:52:41.316]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:41.656 --> 00:52:51.519]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:51.739 --> 00:52:52.499]  Fabled enemies.

[00:53:00.741 --> 00:53:04.082]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:08.183 --> 00:53:15.826]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[00:53:16.266 --> 00:53:17.426]  You need the Paclite.
[00:53:17.867 --> 00:53:25.709]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:29.251]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[00:53:29.651 --> 00:53:34.072]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:53:34.472 --> 00:53:35.733]  The Paclite is so durable,
[00:53:36.013 --> 00:53:40.395]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[00:53:40.835 --> 00:53:45.137]  The Paclite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:53:45.497 --> 00:53:52.160]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.

[00:53:57.924 --> 00:54:02.427]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:14.122 --> 00:54:16.383]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:17.283 --> 00:54:18.224]  This is not a game.
[00:54:18.264 --> 00:54:19.584]  This is not a drill.
[00:54:19.644 --> 00:54:21.305]  This is the real thing.
[00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:23.826]  They are coming after the Second Amendment.
[00:54:23.906 --> 00:54:26.427]  Aaron Zellman, highly respected.
[00:54:28.068 --> 00:54:31.309]  One of the largest Second Amendment advocacy groups in the country.
[00:54:31.809 --> 00:54:32.990]  Filmmaker, researcher.
[00:54:34.093 --> 00:54:50.679]  You know, to come on this show and to say, I believe they are ready to stage terror attacks, stage mass shootings, and there's hundreds of points that back this up, and I know those are the points and others he's going off of, and we know that some of the other mass shootings have been staged events, the evidence is just overwhelming.
[00:54:51.579 --> 00:54:57.641]  It's very easy for him to do this, and we know other governments have done this, it's been done in Australia, it's been done in Russia, they've even been caught in Russia.
[00:54:59.415 --> 00:55:04.378]  And uh... they just go in, gun down a patsy, then their guys in black uniforms shoot a bunch of people with masks.
[00:55:04.458 --> 00:55:06.319]  They get in police uniforms, drive out the back.
[00:55:06.779 --> 00:55:10.100]  They always order, the feds always order the locals to stand down.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.001]  That's always for hours while they clean it up.
[00:55:13.262 --> 00:55:17.304]  Some of the people escape and say, I saw more than one person.
[00:55:17.344 --> 00:55:19.725]  I saw police shooting people.
[00:55:19.785 --> 00:55:21.146]  That happened in Columbine.
[00:55:21.526 --> 00:55:25.188]  That's been in the Denver Post, but then the police covered it up.
[00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:28.210]  This is sick, but
[00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:43.439]  I want to flesh that out some more, how you see them doing it, or what police, we know most police and even Feds aren't involved in this, special units do it, about how we can stop them from doing it, because clearly you can see they're stacked, they're ready, they're ready to launch, they're going to need this event.
[00:55:43.659 --> 00:55:46.701]  Even Rush Limbaugh said he believes they're staging events in the past.
[00:55:46.761 --> 00:55:49.482]  He said, you ever notice how when they got a gun bill introduced, something happens?
[00:55:51.343 --> 00:55:51.724]  Aaron Zellman?
[00:55:51.744 --> 00:55:53.905]  I'm sorry Alex, you want to say that to me one more time, the last sentence?
[00:55:54.465 --> 00:55:56.447]  Aaron Zellman, just break it down for us.
[00:55:56.927 --> 00:55:58.488]  Break down false flag attacks.
[00:55:59.813 --> 00:56:05.356]  Well, I'm not an expert on it, but I think that people can look at past experience and see how they've done it, the mechanics of it.
[00:56:06.376 --> 00:56:09.018]  You take a look at the Stockton massacre with Patrick Purdy.
[00:56:09.978 --> 00:56:11.919]  Very suspicious about how it happened.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.301]  There have been other events like that.
[00:56:16.181 --> 00:56:19.203]  And you'll always notice that the shooter always commits suicide.
[00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:24.145]  So it's all, it's very clean for the government.
[00:56:25.306 --> 00:56:26.166]  They just wrap it up.
[00:56:26.206 --> 00:56:27.667]  You look at the way they handled Waco.
[00:56:28.562 --> 00:56:31.544]  I mean, they do it the way they want to do it.
[00:56:31.564 --> 00:56:32.545]  They kill people off.
[00:56:33.345 --> 00:56:34.926]  And then they have the official story.
[00:56:35.627 --> 00:56:44.052]  And so I think the people need to be always alert about the official story, because that says a whole lot that they hope that the people don't read between the lines.
[00:56:45.713 --> 00:56:46.134]  Yeah.
[00:56:46.254 --> 00:56:55.540]  I think that's something that everyone can get their hands on, because the official story will be trumpeted by, you know, Charlie Gibson and Katie Couric and all the rest of those morons.
[00:56:56.403 --> 00:56:59.911]  And they will keep pushing the official story.
[00:57:00.271 --> 00:57:02.957]  And that's when you have to get very, very nervous.
[00:57:03.755 --> 00:57:06.817]  Because that official story is what they want you to believe.
[00:57:06.897 --> 00:57:07.958]  It isn't exactly the truth.
[00:57:08.299 --> 00:57:09.780]  Well, the BATF... It may not be the truth.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:30.255]  The BATF on record, and they covered this up for years, out in Arizona, did tests of blowing up, in the months before 95, Alvin P. Murrow building bombing, of blowing up Ryder trucks filled with ammonium nitrate, and then they were there minutes after telling doctors, patch me up, and the doctors said, you're not hurt.
[00:57:30.795 --> 00:57:32.657]  So, I mean, they clearly are some dirty guys.
[00:57:33.417 --> 00:57:35.018]  Well, there's no surprise there.
[00:57:35.058 --> 00:57:43.784]  I mean, the ATF, as you know, frames innocent gun owners and sends them off to prison, claiming that they're semi-automatics or machine guns.
[00:57:43.824 --> 00:57:50.529]  And I think you're going to see more of that, where a malfunctioning semi-automatic automatic is considered to be a machine gun.
[00:57:50.969 --> 00:58:01.797]  In fact, I think your listeners need to understand that there was a point made in a recent court case with a David Olovson, where the court agreed that, according with the ATF, that if a firearm
[00:58:02.466 --> 00:58:06.769]  Oh my gosh, I remember seeing that ruling and expanding on that.
[00:58:20.581 --> 00:58:26.523]  The bigger issue is that these gun ranges, if your gun accidentally double fires, they run and tattle and call the police on you.
[00:58:26.923 --> 00:58:37.666]  So it goes to the Stasi, Secret Police, Gestapo, tattletale culture out there by the people that claim they're pro-Second Amendment.
[00:58:38.606 --> 00:58:42.668]  Well, quite bluntly, there's plenty of cowards in the pro-Second Amendment movement.
[00:58:43.468 --> 00:58:46.149]  But if people would like to know more, they can go to our website, Alex.
[00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:47.349]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:58:47.389 --> 00:58:48.009]  Back in one minute.
[00:58:48.409 --> 00:58:50.090]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:53.178 --> 00:58:55.400]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.582 --> 00:58:59.163]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:59.283 --> 00:59:03.866]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:04.027 --> 00:59:06.769]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[00:59:06.989 --> 00:59:09.851]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:10.031 --> 00:59:14.735]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:14.975 --> 00:59:15.896]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:16.097 --> 00:59:19.041]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:19.341 --> 00:59:26.251]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:26.331 --> 00:59:29.455]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:29.615 --> 00:59:29.876]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[00:59:45.525 --> 00:59:46.165]  Take action today.
[00:59:46.185 --> 00:59:47.406]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:00:00.251 --> 01:00:02.152]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:05.555]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:09.237 --> 01:00:20.025]  Alright, well we just interviewed Aaron Zellman, JPFO.org, about the situation we're facing with the Second Amendment.
[01:00:30.034 --> 01:00:33.395]  Jason Burmess is waiting in the wings right over here.
[01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:36.216]  And he'll be on screen with us.
[01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:37.737]  Look, Star Trek in here.
[01:00:38.317 --> 01:00:39.997]  Jason Burmess on screen.
[01:00:40.718 --> 01:00:42.058]  Warp 1 engage.
[01:00:43.478 --> 01:00:44.579]  To planet Burmy.
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:55.642]  So, uh, again, Jason Mermis will be riding shotgun with us here for the rest of the hour.
[01:00:56.302 --> 01:00:59.123]  I have a bunch of news I want to get into.
[01:00:59.763 --> 01:01:03.984]  Every day I see articles like this one.
[01:01:05.045 --> 01:01:07.025]  You think I'm trying to demonize family services?
[01:01:07.045 --> 01:01:11.386]  You think I'm trying to demonize the states and the feds kidnapping kids over a million a year?
[01:01:13.067 --> 01:01:13.147]  Oh.
[01:01:14.991 --> 01:01:19.754]  Well, right here, we'll put it on screen for you, a state may compensate juveniles sentenced by judges.
[01:01:20.794 --> 01:01:23.716]  And this goes on right here in Austin, by the way, this is confirmed.
[01:01:24.437 --> 01:01:29.299]  No judge, no jury, it's not a real judge, not a real court, no due process.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:35.223]  They're so lazy when they kidnap small children, they don't even get the names right on the paperwork.
[01:01:36.323 --> 01:01:41.508]  They'll be kidnapping a newborn baby and say, the three-year-old had cigarettes put out on his arm, and it's a baby.
[01:01:42.149 --> 01:01:43.290]  They'll have the name wrong on it.
[01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:46.212]  I mean, I've been at cases covering it, and you can't believe it.
[01:01:46.613 --> 01:01:49.295]  And the judges are like demon creatures.
[01:01:49.335 --> 01:01:54.320]  I mean, if they ever needed to have a psychopath for a movie, Hollywood should go do central casting out of these family court judges.
[01:01:54.741 --> 01:01:56.883]  I mean, they're always the same, just always just like...
[01:01:57.691 --> 01:02:09.701]  I mean, they'll even make faces like that, and they call the families in, they're shaking, the child's done nothing wrong, and they'll go, you sign this document and this decree agreement right now, or you'll never see your other children again!
[01:02:09.721 --> 01:02:13.825]  And then the father will go, oh, uh, no!
[01:02:14.185 --> 01:02:15.486]  That's it, arrest him!
[01:02:15.506 --> 01:02:17.188]  And the guy will start crying, please, I didn't do anything wrong!
[01:02:17.228 --> 01:02:18.829]  And she goes, trust me, sign it!
[01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:21.011]  And the guy, a personal sign, they'll go, ah!
[01:02:22.108 --> 01:02:23.529]  They literally make a demon face.
[01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.989]  I've seen it.
[01:02:24.629 --> 01:02:26.230]  Actually, your heart kind of hits you.
[01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:27.290]  I've just seen a demon!
[01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:28.451]  I've just seen a demon!
[01:02:29.171 --> 01:02:31.092]  And so I see this stuff every day.
[01:02:31.172 --> 01:02:35.494]  Just pure, evil, sickening, degenerate criminals running everything.
[01:02:36.274 --> 01:02:39.476]  The exception is good courts and good systems.
[01:02:39.536 --> 01:02:43.037]  It's totally bankrupt, run for criminals, by and for criminals.
[01:02:43.057 --> 01:02:43.818]  We're going to do that with him.
[01:02:44.178 --> 01:02:47.980]  And that dovetails with the report I
[01:02:49.264 --> 01:02:58.387]  was getting into earlier about Al Gore going around saying your parents are dumb, your parents are stupid, you know better than them, you know global warming's real.
[01:02:58.987 --> 01:03:09.490]  So inducting these children into the climate change, oh my gosh, they're seasons, that's illegal, I better pay a tax, to scare everybody.
[01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:14.231]  Now they're yearly seasons, they're also decade seasons and hundred year seasons.
[01:03:16.175 --> 01:03:17.778]  They are called cycles.
[01:03:18.459 --> 01:03:23.248]  So we will be getting into that as well with Jason Burmas.
[01:03:25.252 --> 01:03:25.853]  And you know what?
[01:03:26.214 --> 01:03:28.458]  I'm not going to build up any...
[01:03:30.779 --> 01:03:33.562]  You know, build up too much anticipation.
[01:03:34.082 --> 01:03:43.052]  At the end of the show today, I'm gonna make a special announcement about the future of this radio show and everything we're doing here with this operation and more.
[01:03:43.412 --> 01:03:46.175]  So that is coming up later in this hour.
[01:03:46.275 --> 01:03:47.637]  I'm looking for my Al Gore
[01:03:48.869 --> 01:03:56.835]  News article, and we have the audio clips, but I want to go over the Al Gore article itself after we come back from break.
[01:03:56.855 --> 01:03:59.597]  But the state, bottom line, is taking over your children.
[01:03:59.637 --> 01:04:01.318]  The state is saying they own your children.
[01:04:01.698 --> 01:04:17.570]  The state is saying in court rulings that parents don't control their children, that states have no jurisdiction over their children, that parents don't have any custody of their children, that the state, mothers and fathers exist to make babies for the state.
[01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:22.819]  So the pedophiles that run the state and the criminals that run the state can have their way with them.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:35.368]  And all over the nation, thousands and thousands of cases of entire jurisdictions, entire states, entire courts run by people who are child kidnappers.
[01:04:35.429 --> 01:04:37.130]  It's legalized child kidnapping.
[01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:41.993]  Whereas they used to grab people out of the jungles of Africa and put them on slave ships, here they just grab your children.
[01:04:42.674 --> 01:04:44.856]  So we'll go over that with Jason Burmess.
[01:04:46.209 --> 01:04:50.313]  As well, after we get back, after this quick break.
[01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:54.997]  Right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network, simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:55.017 --> 01:04:56.018]  By the way, that's special!
[01:04:56.398 --> 01:05:01.863]  On five plus months free of PrisonPlanet.tv right now, ends next Monday.
[01:05:02.283 --> 01:05:02.464]  So...
[01:05:07.515 --> 01:05:13.158]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:05:13.358 --> 01:05:18.502]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:05:18.782 --> 01:05:23.865]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:05:24.165 --> 01:05:27.727]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:29.728]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[01:05:30.048 --> 01:05:36.049]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:39.811]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:05:40.071 --> 01:05:44.612]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:05:44.892 --> 01:05:45.672]  Do your part.
[01:05:45.932 --> 01:05:48.193]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:54.675]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[01:05:54.995 --> 01:05:57.397]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.

[01:06:07.023 --> 01:06:13.427]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:13.787 --> 01:06:15.548]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:17.441]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:17.961 --> 01:06:18.461]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:18.761 --> 01:06:19.742]  This is his M.O.
[01:06:19.762 --> 01:06:21.083]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:21.103 --> 01:06:22.824]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:23.124 --> 01:06:29.868]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:30.268 --> 01:06:30.708]  Some U.S.
[01:06:30.748 --> 01:06:36.412]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:37.092 --> 01:06:40.634]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:40.974 --> 01:06:50.840]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:51.821]  Fabled enemies.
[01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:59.605]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:00.046 --> 01:07:03.408]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:06.943 --> 01:07:10.226]  Aging doesn't only show in your face, but it can be felt in your body.
[01:07:10.587 --> 01:07:15.071]  You feel tired, your joints and muscles ache, and your mind seems clouded and forgetful.

[01:07:42.110 --> 01:07:43.211]  Anti-Age Max.

[01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:13.071]  Big Brother.
[01:08:13.766 --> 01:08:14.806]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:15.547 --> 01:08:16.627]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:17.307 --> 01:08:18.107]  You want answers?
[01:08:18.888 --> 01:08:20.348]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:20.428 --> 01:08:24.169]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.629 --> 01:08:28.731]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:28.931 --> 01:08:35.453]  Alright, we're going to Jason Berman's of the Balancing Hour for a ton of news and his take on it.
[01:08:36.343 --> 01:08:38.346]  There he is right there, waiting in the wings.
[01:08:38.767 --> 01:08:41.331]  Live at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:08:42.093 --> 01:08:43.034]  Ridiculous creature.
[01:08:43.054 --> 01:08:44.917]  I always tease Burmese a lot.
[01:08:44.937 --> 01:08:45.398]  I don't know why.
[01:08:45.418 --> 01:08:46.219]  He's always smiling.
[01:08:46.239 --> 01:08:46.500]  That's why.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.301]  It makes you feel good.
[01:08:48.263 --> 01:08:49.144]  Alrighty then.
[01:08:50.615 --> 01:08:52.296]  Big announcement at the end of the show, by the way.
[01:08:52.336 --> 01:08:54.638]  Before we go to Bermas, gotta thank the sponsors.
[01:08:54.678 --> 01:08:57.520]  Sponsors I believe in, and sponsors that make this show possible.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.941]  Like MySolarBackup.com.
[01:09:00.642 --> 01:09:02.423]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:09:02.483 --> 01:09:04.084]  Hurricanes, snow, ice, and storms.
[01:09:04.584 --> 01:09:07.486]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[01:09:07.786 --> 01:09:10.508]  Solar Power Generator is now available from our longtime sponsor.
[01:09:10.828 --> 01:09:16.532]  Solutions from Science is designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[01:09:16.932 --> 01:09:25.581]  You get an 18, you get the emergency power backup kit, which consists of the power source 1800 power plant, and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:09:25.902 --> 01:09:27.443]  That's right, it generates free electricity.
[01:09:27.504 --> 01:09:33.290]  Remember too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:37.292]  The solar power generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[01:09:37.472 --> 01:09:40.074]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[01:09:40.094 --> 01:09:43.155]  The government doesn't own the Sun, folks, yet, so make your move today.
[01:09:43.516 --> 01:09:46.637]  Their website's my, one word, mysolarbackup.com.
[01:09:46.898 --> 01:09:48.058]  That's mysolarbackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:09:48.078 --> 01:09:48.118]  877-327-0365.
[01:09:48.138 --> 01:09:49.579]  If their lines are busy, keep trying.
[01:09:49.599 --> 01:09:50.380]  They'd love to talk to you.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:50.440]  877-327-0365.
[01:10:02.353 --> 01:10:09.403]  And also another one of the sponsors that that goes perfectly with are the great folks at Acola Blue.
[01:10:09.443 --> 01:10:13.509]  You can plug your Acola Blue and other appliances into the battery system off of this and run it.
[01:10:13.949 --> 01:10:14.330]  It is a
[01:10:16.696 --> 01:10:20.840]  Atmospheric water generator for your home, can go on your screened-in porch, whatever.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.542]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[01:10:23.782 --> 01:10:25.104]  Pure clean water without the fluoride.
[01:10:25.604 --> 01:10:26.985]  Ultimate water from the humidity in the air.
[01:10:27.666 --> 01:10:28.867]  Know exactly what you're drinking.
[01:10:28.907 --> 01:10:31.950]  The machine produces 28 liters or 7.5 gallons a day.
[01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:33.391]  They have bigger units if you want that.
[01:10:33.691 --> 01:10:34.852]  Great tasting pure H2O.
[01:10:34.932 --> 01:10:36.233]  Exactly the way nature makes it.
[01:10:36.273 --> 01:10:37.635]  No chemicals, pollutants or toxins.
[01:10:38.115 --> 01:10:39.016]  Neutral pH.
[01:10:39.456 --> 01:10:43.260]  And then it goes through seven different filtration systems including reverse osmosis,
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.840]  Let's bring up Jason Burmess.
[01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:13.899]  Asking what he thinks most important is going on right now and his take on just the world today, the banker takeover, the rest of it.
[01:11:14.199 --> 01:11:24.048]  Then I'm going to get into how the state openly, as we always warned you they were setting up for, is trying to take over the family, take over society, and engaging in every crime imaginable and some I hadn't imagined.
[01:11:24.388 --> 01:11:26.289]  Jason Burmess, good to have you here with us.
[01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:28.751]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:11:28.791 --> 01:11:31.474]  It's a blast to be able to do this over the video cam.
[01:11:32.602 --> 01:11:39.605]  We're going to get more and more of our guests and more and more folks on air with us via video cam.
[01:11:39.645 --> 01:11:41.386]  I think you've got your mic turned up too loud.
[01:11:41.406 --> 01:11:43.747]  I know they did a video check with you, but I don't know about an audio check.
[01:11:44.288 --> 01:11:47.389]  Sounds like you have an air conditioner on in the background.
[01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:49.390]  Sounds like a giant spacecraft is landing.
[01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:51.031]  Or maybe that's just my headphones.
[01:11:52.217 --> 01:11:52.878]  I'm not sure.
[01:11:52.938 --> 01:11:53.399]  Hopefully.
[01:11:53.719 --> 01:11:56.242]  I just set it up with them, so they said my levels were good.
[01:11:56.582 --> 01:11:57.063]  Oh, there it went.
[01:11:57.083 --> 01:11:57.524]  It got better.
[01:11:58.004 --> 01:11:58.485]  It doesn't matter.
[01:11:58.505 --> 01:12:02.409]  I believe it's some kind of heterodyne in the audio, building up to a feedback, but whatever.
[01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:03.631]  May have a new word, heterodyne.
[01:12:03.651 --> 01:12:04.612]  I think heterodyne is a word.
[01:12:04.652 --> 01:12:05.052]  Google it.
[01:12:05.313 --> 01:12:05.673]  Let's see.
[01:12:05.753 --> 01:12:06.875]  Definition, heterodyne.
[01:12:07.135 --> 01:12:07.776]  Look it up for me.
[01:12:07.796 --> 01:12:11.120]  Jason, what do you think is most important?
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:11.861]  What's going on right now?
[01:12:12.813 --> 01:12:22.498]  Well, really, I think it's the combo pack between the glorification of Obama and the Obama administration passing every executive order possible in a very short amount of time.
[01:12:22.518 --> 01:12:24.880]  I mean, they're going to get this stimulus package put through.
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.961]  They're going to carry on renditions.
[01:12:27.001 --> 01:12:29.062]  It doesn't look like they're going to get rid of any of these powers.
[01:12:29.302 --> 01:12:37.267]  And like you highlighted earlier today, Guantanamo Bay won't be gone for another year at least, and they're still going to just have these people in secret prisons.
[01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:41.529]  On top of that, I think we're going to see a total redistribution of forces.
[01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:45.506]  In the Middle East from Iraq to Afghanistan, but I think in the long run.
[01:12:45.899 --> 01:12:51.423]  Not even in the long run, probably in the next 18 months you're going to see an increase in troops overseas, not a decrease.
[01:12:51.943 --> 01:12:58.548]  And of course, like you're talking about, the creation of this domestic type police force at home, I think that's a huge problem.
[01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:09.195]  Meanwhile, every night I turn the television on, Montel Williams is trying to sell me four coins with Obama's face on them, with him, with Washington, and him with Kennedy.
[01:13:09.275 --> 01:13:12.277]  So the brainwashing is definitely, and I think that's the biggest danger.
[01:13:14.448 --> 01:13:15.391]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:13:15.411 --> 01:13:18.779]  I do see a little bit of the Obama-mania wearing off.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.469]  People really thought he was going to fix everything overnight, instead he's trying to make things worse.
[01:13:24.369 --> 01:13:30.611]  Yeah, I mean, obviously, as we progress, we're still going to, uh, we're going to have more and more people wake up.
[01:13:30.691 --> 01:13:34.592]  And now the right seems to be telling a little bit more of the truth, like you highlighted earlier.
[01:13:34.812 --> 01:13:42.234]  You know, Glenn Beck actually did this chart, you know, and he's attacking Al Gore for global warming, just like you would, you said.
[01:13:42.814 --> 01:13:47.295]  And he shows this chart of the inflation, how much money is being printed.
[01:13:47.335 --> 01:13:50.116]  And literally he gets on a ladder at the very end and shows the top of it.
[01:13:50.496 --> 01:13:53.937]  So I think a lot of people financially on the right are going to start waking up.
[01:13:54.517 --> 01:13:57.197]  And it's going to be good for the gold and silver market.
[01:13:57.237 --> 01:13:58.418]  You see gold shooting up.
[01:13:58.458 --> 01:13:59.978]  I think silver is going to shoot up too.
[01:14:00.258 --> 01:14:02.498]  I think people are going to start getting into hard currencies.
[01:14:02.799 --> 01:14:15.781]  But as long as they keep this left-right paradigm alive, as long as the Keith Olbermanns of the world are worshipping Obama, and like you talked about earlier, you said this CEO cap is absolute nonsense.
[01:14:15.801 --> 01:14:17.742]  They're not going to be making $500,000 at the international and national banks.
[01:14:20.342 --> 01:14:35.849]  So, the public, you know, already I'm hearing people today saying, isn't it great, he's capping the salaries, he's capping the salaries, and I'm thinking to myself, these CEOs that were making, you know, $25 million a year on the books, and probably another $50 million off the books, aren't going to give up their salaries.
[01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:40.331]  Well, what's happening is, it's a bait and switch.
[01:14:41.191 --> 01:14:44.813]  They admit that they are
[01:14:46.343 --> 01:14:49.325]  Putting in loopholes for the big four banks in the U.S.
[01:14:49.766 --> 01:14:54.810]  and all of their executives, and it doesn't count for the big companies that took the bailout previously.
[01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:59.193]  Well, that was, that's when people say there's two bailouts, there's not.
[01:14:59.794 --> 01:15:04.758]  The other bailout is unlimited money, total secrecy, no one can investigate the private central banks.
[01:15:05.518 --> 01:15:13.204]  The new bailout is those banks being given trillions more to go out and forcibly buy up the depressed economy.
[01:15:14.295 --> 01:15:17.157]  So, it's just an incredible bait-and-switch.
[01:15:18.938 --> 01:15:19.618]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:19.658 --> 01:15:23.901]  But, you know, I do see more and more people waking up to the fact that we've been had.
[01:15:24.381 --> 01:15:36.669]  You know, I was watching some C-SPAN last night, and they were having the Bernie Madoff hearings, and at least the members were attacking the SEC for not going after what seemed like any large POGSI scheme.
[01:15:36.809 --> 01:15:40.571]  Because we're finding out that there's a lot more POGSI schemes other than Bernie Madoff's, obviously.
[01:15:40.591 --> 01:15:42.853]  The whole Federal Reserve System is a POGSI scheme.
[01:15:43.994 --> 01:15:44.514]  Exactly.
[01:15:44.595 --> 01:15:46.337]  And now they're starting to criticize the Fed.
[01:15:46.617 --> 01:15:52.506]  My only fear is that through criticizing the Fed, we're just going to have a new international form of currency.
[01:15:52.586 --> 01:15:53.106]  Exactly.
[01:15:53.166 --> 01:15:53.507]  No, no.
[01:15:53.547 --> 01:15:58.314]  They're killing the Fed in name to create the new Federal Reserve known as the Bank of the U.S.
[01:15:59.741 --> 01:16:06.530]  Fourth Bank of the United States, but it's going to be private, called the Bank of the U.S., just like the private Federal Reserve was called the Federal Reserve.
[01:16:06.931 --> 01:16:08.973]  See, they can't, now that everybody knows it's private.
[01:16:09.214 --> 01:16:10.355]  Ten years ago, I got laughed at.
[01:16:10.636 --> 01:16:11.897]  Fifteen years ago, I got laughed at.
[01:16:12.438 --> 01:16:14.020]  You know, David Ray Griffin and...
[01:16:14.801 --> 01:16:15.362]  I don't know.
[01:16:36.824 --> 01:16:44.105]  Now the Republicans are out of power, the right-wing phony media can start talking about all of this and keep some credibility, because they're out of power.
[01:16:44.786 --> 01:16:54.947]  But see, then the Democrats now, they won't talk about their leadership being involved in corruption, because the petty, low-level Democrats feel like it's an extension of their personal power through the Democratic Party.
[01:16:55.267 --> 01:16:56.248]  Same thing with the Republicans.
[01:16:56.288 --> 01:16:58.948]  I mean, folks, this is the final New World Order move.
[01:16:59.268 --> 01:17:03.389]  You've got to wake up and stop being so foolish and having this stupid party loyalty.
[01:17:07.244 --> 01:17:10.687]  Four years, they could bring in the North American Union.
[01:17:10.727 --> 01:17:18.775]  I mean, this could be the time where Obama gets everybody under a new type of currency and a new structure for North America.
[01:17:19.095 --> 01:17:26.082]  I could see that happening under this guy, especially if the economy tanks even further in the next six months, which everybody seems to be predicting.
[01:17:26.122 --> 01:17:30.506]  So, let's say that we double the job losses in the next two months, which could happen.
[01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:38.393]  I could see them saying, well, we really do need to not only restructure the banking industry, but we're going to have to do so through infrastructure.
[01:17:38.633 --> 01:17:43.577]  And this is where they bring in their super highways that are shown in the SPP documents.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.100]  Absolutely.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:51.984]  I was right about heterodyne being where a frequency starts feeding back and building up and building up, or two frequencies going together.
[01:17:52.484 --> 01:18:03.230]  Having alternative currents of two different frequencies that are combined to produce two new frequencies, the sum of the difference of the original frequencies, either of which may be used in radio or television receivers, by proper tuning of the filtering.
[01:18:04.918 --> 01:18:05.679]  There you have it.
[01:18:05.699 --> 01:18:09.421]  I mean, I don't know if that's actually a heterodyne we were hearing, but heterodyne.
[01:18:10.122 --> 01:18:12.063]  Okay, Burmese, you know I'm obsessed with words.
[01:18:12.283 --> 01:18:20.309]  Now, um, when we come back from break, I want to get your take on Al Gore caught on tape, but they do this in all the public schools.
[01:18:20.349 --> 01:18:26.313]  I mean, Time magazine for kids, over and over again, every time I see an issue of it, it says, your parents don't know what's going on with the environment.
[01:18:26.333 --> 01:18:27.234]  You're smart and cool.
[01:18:27.534 --> 01:18:28.335]  Get them in line.
[01:18:28.755 --> 01:18:32.499]  And the New York Times comes out and says it, or your parents need to be tattled on.
[01:18:32.519 --> 01:18:33.360]  Are they smoking pot?
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:34.521]  What's in their medicine cabinet?
[01:18:34.761 --> 01:18:37.203]  The cop comes and pats them on the head and the kid reports on them.
[01:18:37.444 --> 01:18:42.689]  I mean, this is classical East German Stasi or Soviet Russia, but they're just doing it, Burmess!
[01:18:44.488 --> 01:18:53.975]  Yeah, you know, I was watching the Weather Channel last night, and they're actually admitting, they're like, well, it's the coldest winter on record, and in fact, my Time Warner was out earlier today because of the cold.
[01:18:54.035 --> 01:18:58.338]  I mean, there's actually outages going on, not only at cable, but internet up here, because it's so cold.
[01:18:58.858 --> 01:19:04.903]  And they pooh-poohed it, they're like, yeah, it seems like it's getting colder, but then they bring in the global warming expert.
[01:19:05.223 --> 01:19:13.505]  And they show this big chart of the globe, and they show this big heating on the top, and that's what's causing the cooling in places like New York and Illinois.
[01:19:13.725 --> 01:19:17.927]  Well, they claim last year the ice caps shrunk at record levels.
[01:19:17.947 --> 01:19:19.627]  They actually expanded at record levels.
[01:19:19.647 --> 01:19:21.368]  I mean, we have the satellite photos.
[01:19:21.748 --> 01:19:22.448]  They're liars.
[01:19:23.588 --> 01:19:25.549]  They claim polar bears can't swim.
[01:19:25.789 --> 01:19:27.369]  They claim polar bears can't swim.
[01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:29.390]  It's the best swimming land animal.
[01:19:30.834 --> 01:19:36.082]  Yes, and you know I saw that commercial on last night, that there aren't going to be polar bears in the next ten years unless we do something.
[01:19:36.262 --> 01:19:39.827]  And there's this huge, huge, huge push for green.
[01:19:40.167 --> 01:19:42.090]  I mean, you hear green everywhere now.
[01:19:42.391 --> 01:19:44.213]  Well, let's talk about what green really means.
[01:19:44.273 --> 01:19:46.136]  It means getting the green out of your wallet for good.
[01:19:47.117 --> 01:19:53.385]  It means turning your little kids into little Stasi's and they'll get them used to tattling and bossing you on the environment and parents will be like, oh, Junior cares.
[01:19:53.866 --> 01:19:55.928]  No, Junior's being taught how to be a scumbag.
[01:19:56.188 --> 01:20:01.695]  By the way, Junior, you go tattling on your parents, they're going to take you and throw you in a group home and rape you.
[01:20:01.715 --> 01:20:06.381]  Okay, your parents, your family come first, not the degenerate scumbag government.
[01:20:07.648 --> 01:20:10.689]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:20:11.129 --> 01:20:14.429]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:20.851]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:20:21.211 --> 01:20:25.352]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:20:25.852 --> 01:20:31.573]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:20:31.873 --> 01:20:34.934]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:20:35.274 --> 01:20:35.954]  Run some pumps,
[01:20:36.374 --> 01:20:36.774]  We're good.
[01:20:57.556 --> 01:21:01.659]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:05.963]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:21:05.983 --> 01:21:13.829]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:21:14.389 --> 01:21:15.951]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:21:15.991 --> 01:21:17.592]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:21:17.692 --> 01:21:20.494]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:21:20.554 --> 01:21:24.677]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:21:33.803 --> 01:21:38.695]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:21:42.498 --> 01:21:43.839]  How dare you!
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.984]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:21:50.004 --> 01:21:52.807]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:59.152]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:21:59.372 --> 01:22:01.954]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:22:02.214 --> 01:22:04.216]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:22:04.476 --> 01:22:06.998]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.281]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:10.714 --> 01:22:16.177]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:22:16.757 --> 01:22:17.257]  That's right.
[01:22:17.578 --> 01:22:19.859]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:22:20.419 --> 01:22:27.383]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:22:27.903 --> 01:22:33.566]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs.
[01:22:34.045 --> 01:22:35.586]  Yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:36.027 --> 01:22:40.890]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:22:41.511 --> 01:22:46.535]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.336 --> 01:22:51.459]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:22:51.839 --> 01:22:52.099]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.119 --> 01:22:54.041]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:22:54.101 --> 01:22:54.421]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:54.701 --> 01:22:54.982]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:03.684 --> 01:23:03.864]  2-2-3-7.
[01:23:07.885 --> 01:23:13.347]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:23:13.387 --> 01:23:13.927]  and the world.
[01:23:14.187 --> 01:23:17.628]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:23:18.048 --> 01:23:24.270]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:26.330]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:23:26.571 --> 01:23:31.792]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[01:23:31.992 --> 01:23:34.553]  With double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:23:34.793 --> 01:23:39.234]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:23:39.494 --> 01:23:45.036]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:23:45.296 --> 01:23:47.316]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:23:47.476 --> 01:23:49.717]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[01:23:50.077 --> 01:23:50.858]  Free of charge.
[01:23:51.158 --> 01:23:51.478]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[01:23:51.498 --> 01:23:51.558]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:23:51.579 --> 01:23:53.100]  Or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.242]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:23:55.262 --> 01:23:55.622]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:24:09.238 --> 01:24:16.166]  While you're cooking dinner, you get home at 6 o'clock after traffic, your children are there, they're watching television, while they're playing video games.
[01:24:16.667 --> 01:24:22.113]  The state's been brainwashing them all day, turning them against you, and now Nickelodeon, everything is propaganda.
[01:24:23.194 --> 01:24:24.054]  Here's one we got.
[01:24:24.394 --> 01:24:25.495]  Brainwashing commercial.
[01:24:25.515 --> 01:24:28.396]  This is a high school student during lunch just sent us this listing of the show.
[01:24:28.816 --> 01:24:33.398]  I was watching Nickelodeon with my three-year-old sister and saw a commercial for an online game hosted on Nickelodeon.
[01:24:33.918 --> 01:24:35.739]  It's called Nickelodeon Global Warming Challenge.
[01:24:35.759 --> 01:24:42.642]  You pick a Nick character, Spongebob, and you go on an adventure destroying dangerous CO2 monsters that plants breathe, by the way.
[01:24:45.183 --> 01:24:46.963]  The water it's swimming in is made up out of CO2.
[01:24:47.003 --> 01:24:51.005]  To defeat global warming and save the last remaining green site cities.
[01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:53.711]  The brainwashing starts early on, eh?
[01:24:54.471 --> 01:24:59.315]  I don't know how to find footage of the actual commercial, but I'm sure if anyone can find it, it's Alex Jones.
[01:24:59.515 --> 01:25:00.435]  Oh, come on, we can find it.
[01:25:00.936 --> 01:25:01.576]  You can find it, too.
[01:25:01.636 --> 01:25:03.477]  I can't give you a link to the description of the game.
[01:25:03.517 --> 01:25:05.018]  I can probably find the game itself.
[01:25:06.119 --> 01:25:07.920]  Here's the game description.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.680]  We did find that.
[01:25:09.081 --> 01:25:12.523]  I'm sure you can find the actual game on nick.com slash games.
[01:25:13.163 --> 01:25:14.484]  I don't have time to find it.
[01:25:14.704 --> 01:25:15.325]  I'm at school.
[01:25:15.445 --> 01:25:16.285]  Computers are slow.
[01:25:16.605 --> 01:25:18.447]  Not to mention my class starts in seven minutes.
[01:25:19.454 --> 01:25:20.334]  Hope this is useful.
[01:25:20.374 --> 01:25:21.535]  Remember, freedom is slavery.
[01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:22.395]  Slavery is freedom.
[01:25:22.795 --> 01:25:29.917]  With a 1984 quote, and that's from Kevin S., a high school student, fighting the New World Order inside a government indoctrination camp.
[01:25:30.357 --> 01:25:33.197]  And Jason, I have stacks of such things we're trying to pull up.
[01:25:33.638 --> 01:25:34.818]  We have the description of the game.
[01:25:34.858 --> 01:25:38.639]  I want to pull the game up on screen and show people the evil CO2 monsters.
[01:25:39.359 --> 01:25:46.361]  I mean, folks, do you have children and raise them and change their diapers and feed them and everything and love them to hand them over to the degenerate government?
[01:25:46.401 --> 01:25:47.021]  Jason Burmess.
[01:25:48.646 --> 01:25:51.868]  Yeah, I think this is a psy-op that's been going on since my generation.
[01:25:51.908 --> 01:25:56.652]  I mean, I remember being sat down and watching a movie with all these celebrities that I knew.
[01:25:57.232 --> 01:25:58.153]  Ted Danson.
[01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:01.115]  I remember the guy from Doogie Howser was on it.
[01:26:01.155 --> 01:26:02.075]  Whoopi Goldberg.
[01:26:02.356 --> 01:26:06.999]  And in one of the segments, he was supposedly going outside ten years later.
[01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:12.961]  And he was in a radioactive suit, and it was gonna kill the ozone layer, and I believed it.
[01:26:13.081 --> 01:26:19.183]  I mean, I know a lot of intelligent people that fall for this because, inherently, I mean, we don't want to pollute the planet, Alex.
[01:26:19.223 --> 01:26:19.964]  It's indoctrination, though.
[01:26:19.984 --> 01:26:21.564]  We're not saying, oh, let's dump things in the river.
[01:26:21.804 --> 01:26:22.885]  It's the genetic engineering.
[01:26:22.905 --> 01:26:24.485]  They're keeping all the bad stuff going.
[01:26:25.086 --> 01:26:26.986]  All this is is a push for global taxation.
[01:26:27.186 --> 01:26:31.068]  Remember how they would deny on the shows for taxation, and now they admit it's for taxation?
[01:26:33.171 --> 01:26:39.274]  Yeah, now you have congressmen, you know, people like Chris Dodd introducing this into legislation under a carbon tax.
[01:26:39.715 --> 01:26:47.679]  And, you know, I remember watching your film, America Destroyed by Design, some years back, and you exposed the United Nations was actually land-grabbing!
[01:26:48.115 --> 01:26:50.816]  Under this provision of environmentalism.
[01:26:51.076 --> 01:26:52.476]  Okay, this isn't doing anything for us.
[01:26:52.696 --> 01:27:00.599]  This is giving the globalists not only large chunks of land, but then they're regulating our lives through carbon taxes, through fictional man-made global warming.
[01:27:00.619 --> 01:27:02.640]  Look, no one's saying that the climate doesn't change.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.980]  The climate has changed throughout history.
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:06.361]  I mean, we used to be Pangea.
[01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:07.121]  No, that's a lie.
[01:27:07.141 --> 01:27:07.741]  It's Al-Qaeda.
[01:27:10.722 --> 01:27:12.683]  What about Captain Planet?
[01:27:14.523 --> 01:27:15.023]  Exactly!
[01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:16.304]  I mean, all these shows.
[01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:20.664]  Well, you know, what really got me upset was earlier this year...
[01:27:21.321 --> 01:27:34.590]  When I was down in Texas, and you guys did that story on the ABC Planet Slayer website, where there was just bloody pig carcasses around, and the pig's life was worth more than yours, because your carbon footprint was up in 18 months.
[01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:41.655]  Yeah, this is a video game in Australian schools, ABC News Australia, and it was on there, and it said, when do you have to kill yourself?
[01:27:42.135 --> 01:27:49.300]  And it was teaching them on the site that at 15 years old, it's time to kill yourself, because if you don't kill yourself, it's going to kill the earth.
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.981]  They're teaching them death
[01:27:51.481 --> 01:28:05.812]  That's why suicides weigh up all over the West because they teach the little kids don't commit suicide this way and when you get depressed don't don't go in the bathroom and hang yourself on the door stall and then it explodes and then now they just got video games going kill yourself
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.521]  Yeah, and it's not even 15 years old, literally 18 months.
[01:28:10.161 --> 01:28:12.642]  What's wrong with you?
[01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:13.883]  They've got to save the earth.
[01:28:14.943 --> 01:28:16.224]  It's unbelievable to me.
[01:28:16.264 --> 01:28:18.625]  And you know, this does relate to the indoctrination.
[01:28:18.685 --> 01:28:19.925]  Even when I was a kid, the D.A.R.E.
[01:28:19.985 --> 01:28:24.587]  program, you know, if I remember the commercials, you know, I learned it by watching you.
[01:28:24.667 --> 01:28:27.328]  And of course, the kid learned how to smoke pot from his father.
[01:28:27.548 --> 01:28:28.789]  And his father's the bad guy.
[01:28:29.619 --> 01:28:30.940]  He should be ratting out his dad.
[01:28:31.421 --> 01:28:44.732]  I mean, it is just unbelievable to me the amount of propaganda that has been pushed upon me throughout my entire life and continues to be pushed upon the newer generation that, unfortunately Alex, I see them more brainwashed than ever.
[01:28:45.172 --> 01:28:51.198]  I mean you watch the commercials in the Super Bowl and another commercial really caught me about how dumbed it down we are.
[01:28:51.238 --> 01:29:02.888]  There's this guy sitting in his garage and there's all these monkeys around him working on his car and literally the monkeys are smarter than him and his friend that are having this conversation that five-year-olds could have.
[01:29:03.248 --> 01:29:12.896]  You know, I mean, they're talking real slow, their eyes are open, they don't know what's going on, they're very docile, and this is the new acceptance in our society.
[01:29:12.976 --> 01:29:14.297]  Oh, they're teaching people.
[01:29:14.797 --> 01:29:15.778]  They're teaching people.
[01:29:16.018 --> 01:29:20.442]  Listen, half of the corn syrup products, which is most products, have high levels of mercury.
[01:29:20.982 --> 01:29:24.704]  Associated Press, Mainstream News, there's no talk of taking the mercury out.
[01:29:24.724 --> 01:29:25.944]  They tell you mercury is good for you.
[01:29:26.345 --> 01:29:28.125]  They think you're so stupid, public.
[01:29:28.406 --> 01:29:37.370]  They go on the news and say, don't worry about melamine in 90% of the milk, don't worry about all these corn syrup products, half of them having high levels of mercury, because it's good for you.
[01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:38.611]  Melamine and mercury are good.
[01:29:38.631 --> 01:29:39.271]  Well, I'm going to tell you.
[01:29:39.471 --> 01:29:41.372]  You can call me a conspiracy theorist all day long.
[01:29:41.932 --> 01:29:44.334]  Mercury and melamine are bad for you.
[01:29:44.894 --> 01:29:45.214]  Okay?
[01:29:45.314 --> 01:29:46.095]  I promise you.
[01:29:46.395 --> 01:29:48.997]  I know you heard it's a conspiracy theory, but it's true.
[01:29:49.477 --> 01:29:50.958]  The globalists want to kill you.
[01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:51.919]  It's called eugenics.
[01:29:52.359 --> 01:29:53.500]  They think there's too many of us.
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.021]  We'll cover that when we get back.
[01:29:55.061 --> 01:29:55.521]  Stay with us.
[01:29:55.561 --> 01:29:56.702]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:29:57.862 --> 01:29:58.783]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.263 --> 01:30:00.864]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.785 --> 01:30:04.467]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:07.914 --> 01:30:12.198]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.

[01:31:07.828 --> 01:31:14.230]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:16.270]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:17.219 --> 01:31:18.260]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:18.781 --> 01:31:19.281]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:19.562 --> 01:31:20.423]  This is his M.O.
[01:31:20.463 --> 01:31:21.864]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:21.924 --> 01:31:23.606]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:23.927 --> 01:31:30.694]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:31.095 --> 01:31:31.515]  Some U.S.
[01:31:31.575 --> 01:31:37.242]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:37.902 --> 01:31:41.365]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:41.385 --> 01:31:43.566]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:09.223]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:32:09.403 --> 01:32:10.865]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:32:11.165 --> 01:32:13.387]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:32:13.847 --> 01:32:18.591]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[01:33:16.027 --> 01:33:23.594]  Yo, if you want to email Joey V, just Joey V at InfoWars.com, one of our new producers.
[01:33:23.914 --> 01:33:25.436]  We'll be announcing another producer tomorrow.
[01:33:27.475 --> 01:33:32.999]  Then, uh, of any propaganda, commercials, TV shows, tips, we'll, uh, play clips here and analyze them.
[01:33:33.639 --> 01:33:36.061]  Had a high schooler just during their lunch hour listening to the show.
[01:33:36.721 --> 01:33:38.962]  Sent us this tip about Spongebob video games.
[01:33:39.643 --> 01:33:44.206]  Uh, actually, it's all the video games now, uh, the free video games on Nickelodeon's website.
[01:33:44.746 --> 01:33:45.827]  Uh, brainwashing the children.
[01:33:45.867 --> 01:33:54.993]  Before I go to that, and get Jason Bermas' take, joining us from upstate New York, we're coming to you from Austin, Texas, tied into the Genesis Network in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[01:33:56.833 --> 01:33:57.693]  I want to break this down.
[01:33:58.274 --> 01:34:03.976]  Why have they been brainwashing people that the Earth is dying, we're in this great crisis, and carbon dioxide is the problem?
[01:34:04.876 --> 01:34:05.557]  For decades.
[01:34:05.957 --> 01:34:06.997]  Well, the Club of Rome told us.
[01:34:07.017 --> 01:34:15.461]  They said it's complete fraud, but they're designing it to teach us that humans are bad, so the state, as Richard Inhofe quotes, can wage war against the population.
[01:34:16.041 --> 01:34:17.222]  Why did Rockefeller fund Hitler?
[01:34:17.442 --> 01:34:17.822]  On record.
[01:34:18.544 --> 01:34:20.767]  You know, major university press books on it.
[01:34:21.348 --> 01:34:22.870]  Why did they fund eugenics?
[01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:23.671]  Sterilization.
[01:34:24.052 --> 01:34:25.274]  There's too many of us, they're saying.
[01:34:25.434 --> 01:34:28.458]  That's why they're pushing for one-child policies in the US and England and Europe.
[01:34:28.879 --> 01:34:31.703]  Despite the fact the West is dying and has a negative population growth.
[01:34:33.103 --> 01:34:38.227]  They're doing all of this, even if you're for eugenics and for reducing the population, and I see the comments on my website.
[01:34:38.247 --> 01:34:43.710]  You have to understand that if they just industrialized things with clean industry and didn't suppress technology, we could fix things.
[01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:51.576]  There's real environmental crises, genetic engineering, toxic waste dumping, things of that nature, nuclear weapons, DU being used all over the planet.
[01:34:52.356 --> 01:34:55.458]  But carbon dioxide is what most of the water in the ocean is made up out of.
[01:34:55.718 --> 01:34:57.158]  It's what the clouds are made up out of.
[01:34:57.198 --> 01:34:58.359]  It's water vapor, basically.
[01:34:59.079 --> 01:35:00.060]  It's what humans exhale.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.060]  It's what plants breathe.
[01:35:01.361 --> 01:35:09.064]  But I see commercials on TV going, you know, waste management companies planting trees that clean the air of deadly carbon dioxide that's killing our Earth.
[01:35:09.865 --> 01:35:11.826]  Four things make life on this planet.
[01:35:11.986 --> 01:35:12.986]  Without these, it doesn't happen.
[01:35:13.006 --> 01:35:14.067]  Without one of these, it doesn't happen.
[01:35:14.467 --> 01:35:18.209]  Oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight.
[01:35:19.261 --> 01:35:21.602]  Well, they're taxing the carbon cycle by doing that.
[01:35:22.603 --> 01:35:28.126]  And, uh, the video game actually says, battle CO2 monsters.
[01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:30.648]  But you're telling me that computer, the way it's hooked up, we can't play audio?
[01:35:32.008 --> 01:35:34.630]  While we have Burma song, we gotta hook another computer up so we can do that in here.
[01:35:34.650 --> 01:35:36.451]  I don't want people to be able to hear the audio from this.
[01:35:36.471 --> 01:35:38.432]  So this is all about eugenics.
[01:35:39.192 --> 01:35:41.414]  And they come into the youth and they say,
[01:35:42.861 --> 01:35:43.822]  You're so important.
[01:35:43.842 --> 01:35:44.663]  You're so special.
[01:35:44.703 --> 01:35:45.624]  You're saving the Earth.
[01:35:45.644 --> 01:35:46.284]  You're a hero.
[01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:48.166]  Your parents are backwards and don't know.
[01:35:48.426 --> 01:35:53.831]  And denying climate change is like denying the Holocaust or denying we needed civil rights.
[01:35:54.031 --> 01:35:58.916]  They actually say this, and Al Gore went part of the way in a speech we're going to play in a minute, just a few days ago.
[01:35:59.897 --> 01:36:00.257]  And so,
[01:36:01.505 --> 01:36:06.109]  You've got to accept that we're going to battle for the CO2, and then your children turn into tattletales.
[01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:10.153]  Now, in fact, Google this, after we show the Spongebobs.
[01:36:10.193 --> 01:36:11.594]  I know you've got it pulled up on screen right now.
[01:36:12.114 --> 01:36:13.396]  Or minimize that and pull this up.
[01:36:13.796 --> 01:36:14.677]  Climate cops.
[01:36:14.697 --> 01:36:15.938]  Just Google climate cops.
[01:36:16.378 --> 01:36:21.282]  They pay the kids, they wear uniforms in England, they're starting it here in the U.S., and it says, boss your parents.
[01:36:21.823 --> 01:36:22.624]  Write your parents.
[01:36:22.884 --> 01:36:23.905]  Tickets will give you.
[01:36:23.945 --> 01:36:24.926]  Fictitious tickets.
[01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:26.907]  And see, it sounds reasonable.
[01:36:26.927 --> 01:36:28.269]  They start them out writing tickets.
[01:36:28.889 --> 01:36:30.770]  Oh, it's for the Earth, and then it's everything else.
[01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:33.451]  It's spying on you for what you're saying, what you're doing.
[01:36:33.851 --> 01:36:35.732]  I mean, this is classic tyranny.
[01:36:36.212 --> 01:36:39.613]  Pint-sized eco-police making parents proud and sometimes crazy.
[01:36:39.974 --> 01:36:40.714]  New York Times.
[01:36:43.295 --> 01:36:44.095]  New York Times.
[01:36:46.096 --> 01:36:49.818]  They're showing the video game on screen right now that, oh, it's making the Earth flood.
[01:36:49.878 --> 01:36:50.778]  Floods aren't natural.
[01:36:51.098 --> 01:36:52.119]  Wind blowing isn't natural.
[01:36:52.159 --> 01:36:52.839]  We're dying!
[01:36:53.079 --> 01:36:54.280]  Kill the climate monsters!
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:55.960]  Here come the saviors!
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:57.441]  But that's coming up in a moment.
[01:36:58.519 --> 01:37:06.303]  Sometimes Jennifer Ross feels she cannot make a move at home without inviting the scorn of her daughters, 10-year-old Grace and 7-year-old Eleza.
[01:37:06.963 --> 01:37:09.405]  The Acura MDX she drives, a flagrant polluter.
[01:37:09.705 --> 01:37:12.846]  The bath at night to help relax her, a wasteful indulgence.
[01:37:13.026 --> 01:37:13.286]  Oh yeah.
[01:37:16.451 --> 01:37:18.051]  Reusable shopping bags, she forgot.
[01:37:18.172 --> 01:37:19.312]  Again, tsk, tsk.
[01:37:19.432 --> 01:37:21.312]  I am very, very environmentally conscious, children.
[01:37:21.793 --> 01:37:22.573]  More so than me.
[01:37:22.613 --> 01:37:24.093]  And I'm embarrassed to say, says Ms.
[01:37:24.153 --> 01:37:28.755]  Ross, a social worker from Dobbs Ferry, New York, they're on my case about getting a hybrid car.
[01:37:28.795 --> 01:37:35.516]  They want me to replace all the light bulbs in the house with the toxic waste mercury bulbs, by the way, that give you headaches, with energy-saving bulbs.
[01:37:35.596 --> 01:37:35.756]  Ms.
[01:37:35.796 --> 01:37:40.818]  Ross' children are part of what experts say is a growing army of eco-kids stepping in environmental
[01:37:41.719 --> 01:37:47.830]  ...at school, in houses of worship, through scouting, and even via popular culture who try to hold their parents accountable at home.
[01:37:49.315 --> 01:37:52.657]  The state always turns the children loose on their parents.
[01:37:52.677 --> 01:38:03.966]  This is the state taking over the children, and we have all these different federal and state court rulings where they're claiming, like the one in California a few months ago, that the state owns your children, that you have no parental rights over them.
[01:38:04.246 --> 01:38:10.610]  And they're trying to pass this United Nations Rights of the Child, where if you tell them your religious belief, they take your children from you.
[01:38:10.671 --> 01:38:13.172]  It says it in there, I was reading it this morning, where if you
[01:38:15.014 --> 01:38:18.979]  Don't let them be brainwashed by the state, then they take them from you.
[01:38:19.019 --> 01:38:21.181]  I mean, this, in Obama's saying, he's not trying to ratify it.
[01:38:21.642 --> 01:38:25.986]  This is all right here, and so I want to play this Al Gore and the Spongebob thing in a moment.
[01:38:26.507 --> 01:38:28.489]  Put up the main screen with all the games.
[01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:32.073]  Eco-warriors fighting carbon dioxide monsters.
[01:38:32.774 --> 01:38:40.046]  And Spongebob and all the other characters the kids love and identify with, they are in there battling the evil monsters.
[01:38:40.106 --> 01:38:41.488]  Put that up on screen for folks.
[01:38:41.548 --> 01:38:42.810]  I want them to see it.
[01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:44.352]  Jason Burmish, your take on all this.
[01:38:45.373 --> 01:38:46.694]  Yeah, it's all over the culture.
[01:38:46.714 --> 01:38:50.355]  And when they're not promoting, you know, global warming to kids, they're promoting the police state.
[01:38:50.395 --> 01:38:52.156]  I mean, I look at video games.
[01:38:52.196 --> 01:38:53.717]  I've got one right here by Microsoft.
[01:38:53.757 --> 01:38:55.538]  It's called Crackdown, Alex.
[01:38:55.598 --> 01:39:01.041]  And it's all about the new genetically engineered soldier that's coming into our states to fight crime.
[01:39:01.241 --> 01:39:04.703]  You know, they... And meanwhile, the Pentagon says they're really moving ahead with that.
[01:39:04.743 --> 01:39:05.023]  Go ahead.
[01:39:05.743 --> 01:39:06.463]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:06.503 --> 01:39:13.466]  I mean, this is the new domestic police force, and it's okay to be genetically enhanced, and you're an agent of justice, and there's no restraints whatsoever.
[01:39:13.506 --> 01:39:17.108]  You can go up and blow somebody's head off in a car, and it doesn't matter.
[01:39:17.168 --> 01:39:20.269]  No trial, no arrest, no one has any rights anymore.
[01:39:20.429 --> 01:39:23.371]  And the kids play this and fantasize with it and become that.
[01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:25.091]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:25.111 --> 01:39:26.792]  And I mean, you look at college...
[01:39:27.912 --> 01:39:37.237]  Call of Duty for the longest time was a game about World War II and it took place, you know, either on the beaches of Normandy or on the Pacific Rim, but Call of Duty 4 comes around and where are they?
[01:39:37.257 --> 01:39:38.398]  They're in Iraq, Alex!
[01:39:38.818 --> 01:39:41.259]  You know, so we're not leaving Iraq anytime soon.
[01:39:41.299 --> 01:39:42.760]  There's going to be battles in the Middle East.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:47.723]  They're bringing in, you know, these new domestic-type games to train us for that next.
[01:39:48.223 --> 01:39:52.706]  Well, I remember games ten years ago where you hunt down and kill militia members.
[01:39:53.506 --> 01:39:54.567]  And you'll even torture them.
[01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:56.381]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:56.441 --> 01:39:57.803]  And torture is a big part of games too.
[01:39:57.843 --> 01:40:00.106]  I mean, that's a huge part of games now.
[01:40:00.146 --> 01:40:02.349]  These interrogations that you can do to your victims.
[01:40:02.369 --> 01:40:06.214]  I mean, you can tie them up, you can cut them slowly, you can shoot them in the leg.
[01:40:06.234 --> 01:40:10.300]  I mean, it's really gotten to a sadistic level I never thought.
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:20.624]  Video games were started as military simulators because they found that a large percentage of troops wouldn't kill somebody up close, but if they did paper targets and desensitized to instinctive shooting, they would.
[01:40:21.104 --> 01:40:24.365]  Now, they make it video games and they're using them for training.
[01:40:24.445 --> 01:40:26.586]  Doom was originally a military training game.
[01:40:27.679 --> 01:40:29.200]  Yeah, it's unbelievable to me.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:35.304]  Those engines, exactly, those engines were used by the military to train troops and then they disperse them among the population.
[01:40:35.324 --> 01:40:41.988]  I mean, if you guys think that, you know, the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3 is at the height of the technology at this point, that's laughable.
[01:40:42.329 --> 01:40:47.132]  I wonder what they're using in military simulators, especially the ones that are classified right now, Alex.
[01:40:47.532 --> 01:40:50.473]  You know, that's going to be amongst the kids in the next five to ten years.
[01:40:50.513 --> 01:40:58.836]  In fact, while you were away, I did a story on the head of Sega actually coming out and saying he was interested in using microchips.
[01:40:58.876 --> 01:41:00.557]  You'll have to have a chip to play the game.
[01:41:00.577 --> 01:41:01.937]  You'll have to have a chip to have a job.
[01:41:01.957 --> 01:41:11.661]  And the transhumanists, who openly in 1952 said, we're changing our name from eugenicists worldwide to the Transhumanist Society, Julian Huxley, the head of the UN UNESCO board,
[01:41:12.541 --> 01:41:27.197]  Change the name to transhumanist and they say, you won't have a job, you won't be able to raise your children, you're gonna have to be augmented, and then everybody's gonna want it like it's the new iPhone and we get the new download of it, literal cyberpunk wirehead, but controlled by the state.
[01:41:27.978 --> 01:41:33.064]  And then even if you think the Matrix is fighting against all this, still the good guys still jack in to go fight the evil.
[01:41:34.195 --> 01:41:44.638]  That's right because eventually there won't be a choice and they're going to do this initially with video game systems because when your kids are whining and saying, oh Joey's got this but I can't play it.
[01:41:45.296 --> 01:41:49.600]  Eventually, they're going to get a job after school or come across a game and they'll chip themselves.
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.383]  You know, they'll go beyond their parents, literally as pre-teens and teenagers, Alex.
[01:41:54.724 --> 01:42:05.652]  And then when their kids are born, it won't be a big thing because they'll probably have three or four different types of RFID chips under their skin for various different... And that's what the New World Order says a hundred years ago the new man was.
[01:42:05.933 --> 01:42:06.293]  They're gonna...
[01:42:06.593 --> 01:42:12.518]  Exterminate the majority of the population, but first they're going to get us to be cybernetically controlled, cybernetically tracked, surveilled.
[01:42:12.838 --> 01:42:23.446]  Those of us that don't accept will be put on reservations like Amish, and then controlled bioweapons releases, and then they're going to kill most of the other, you know, new transhuman people, and the elite believe they're going to ascend to the level of gods.
[01:42:23.686 --> 01:42:25.468]  Now, am I saying that's really going to happen?
[01:42:25.588 --> 01:42:27.950]  I don't know, but they're trying to do it.
[01:42:28.590 --> 01:42:31.612]  And I go back to Bill Joy, why the future doesn't need us killing some microsystems.
[01:42:31.892 --> 01:42:36.234]  He goes to a meeting in 99 and they're all, all these elitist meetings saying we're going to kill everybody.
[01:42:36.534 --> 01:42:37.935]  Folks, this is happening.
[01:42:37.955 --> 01:42:42.977]  The Air Force is converting over to drones, to robots, to combat mechs.
[01:42:42.997 --> 01:42:44.618]  They got Terminator 4 coming out.
[01:42:44.838 --> 01:42:50.081]  What they're not telling you is the elite actually believe they're going to merge with the machines and then kill us.
[01:42:50.441 --> 01:42:52.082]  This is a message to everyone.
[01:42:53.663 --> 01:42:54.824]  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
[01:42:54.844 --> 01:42:57.465]  And I think that drone point is an excellent one because
[01:42:57.793 --> 01:43:00.074]  You know, let's say there is civil unrest in this country.
[01:43:00.334 --> 01:43:08.018]  You know, they're not going to send in a squadron of fighters to the resistance, you know, the 20 or 50 or 100 or 1,000 people that gather to try to resist.
[01:43:08.078 --> 01:43:12.259]  No, they're going to send in drones that are going to fire upon you and you won't have a chance against them.
[01:43:12.459 --> 01:43:15.881]  Technology right now, Alex, is just... What's public?
[01:43:16.261 --> 01:43:18.102]  Is absolutely astounding.
[01:43:18.562 --> 01:43:21.904]  And we have to be very wary of who we put in control of that tech.
[01:43:22.124 --> 01:43:23.325]  Because here's the bigger issue.
[01:43:23.605 --> 01:43:23.965]  Right now.
[01:43:24.305 --> 01:43:24.966]  Here's the bigger issue.
[01:43:24.986 --> 01:43:27.727]  The military says we won't fire on American citizens.
[01:43:27.907 --> 01:43:28.567]  75% on average.
[01:43:28.587 --> 01:43:35.111]  So they take those, put them overseas, give them deadly inoculations, kick them out of the military, use PTSD claims to take away their Second Amendment.
[01:43:35.251 --> 01:43:35.891]  That's already happening.
[01:43:36.111 --> 01:43:41.514]  But they take that 20-something percent and build up a unit, a integrated unit
[01:43:42.014 --> 01:43:43.995]  Inside the United States to carry this out against us.
[01:43:44.035 --> 01:43:50.980]  But in the future, with drone aircraft, drone tanks, drone soldiers, which are now, the Air Force by 2012 will be majority drone.
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:51.820]  They've said that.
[01:43:52.361 --> 01:43:56.163]  The globalists can pre-program it and do it all without soldiers even helping.
[01:43:56.363 --> 01:43:59.345]  And they'll go back to robot factories to be repaired and upgraded.
[01:43:59.865 --> 01:44:01.886]  So, that's why the future doesn't need us.
[01:44:01.926 --> 01:44:03.367]  That's why the elite want to kill us.
[01:44:03.607 --> 01:44:05.429]  That's what this whole New World Order is about.
[01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:09.111]  That's why they're having the bank overtake over right now and telling you austerity.
[01:44:09.131 --> 01:44:09.871]  You'll have no money.
[01:44:09.891 --> 01:44:10.692]  You're going to be poor.
[01:44:10.952 --> 01:44:19.277]  So they can force you to take the jobs they want to force you, like five years ago, the Attorney General of Mexico making all of his employees take implantable microchips to have a job.
[01:44:19.577 --> 01:44:20.658]  This is real.
[01:44:20.938 --> 01:44:21.899]  This is happening.
[01:44:21.939 --> 01:44:23.179]  This is not a movie.
[01:44:23.419 --> 01:44:24.540]  This is the real world.
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:25.561]  I want to go to Al Gore.
[01:44:26.670 --> 01:44:38.018]  This was taped, Glenn Beck played it in a big school auditorium last week, saying that your parents are okay, but you know, like my parents with the civil rights thing, they didn't understand it.
[01:44:38.058 --> 01:44:41.480]  Well, parents just don't understand things as well as you, the young people, do.
[01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:42.241]  You're smart.
[01:44:42.681 --> 01:44:48.926]  And the state is co-opting them, where the 12-year-olds, these were 11 and 12-year-olds, go back and say, Mommy and Daddy,
[01:44:50.899 --> 01:44:52.739]  You know, you are going to do what the state says.
[01:44:52.839 --> 01:44:55.120]  We are going to lower our carbon footprint.
[01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:56.900]  We're going to live as feudalist slaves.
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:57.740]  Here's the first clip.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:58.220]  Al Gore.
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:04.161]  But I'm thinking back now a long way to when I was your age.
[01:45:05.882 --> 01:45:09.882]  And the Civil Rights Revolution was unfolding.
[01:45:11.083 --> 01:45:17.604]  And we kids, and our parents, and their generation,
[01:45:19.913 --> 01:45:29.362]  Explain to me again why it's okay for the law to officially discriminate against people because of their skin color.
[01:45:29.422 --> 01:45:32.945]  And parents try to tell their kids the right thing, you know.
[01:45:34.026 --> 01:45:34.806]  Usually, I do.
[01:45:36.067 --> 01:45:45.576]  And when our parents' generation couldn't answer that question, that's when the laws started to change.
[01:45:47.313 --> 01:45:53.715]  Now, he comes in with the even more important Clev about parents, you know, really aren't as smart or aren't as aware as their children.
[01:45:54.375 --> 01:45:59.477]  And it's your job to go out and, you know, carry the torch out there to get this job done.
[01:45:59.517 --> 01:45:59.877]  Here it is.
[01:46:00.818 --> 01:46:10.101]  There are some things about our world that you know that older people don't know.
[01:46:10.925 --> 01:46:11.525]  Stop right there.
[01:46:11.925 --> 01:46:13.626]  You're an 11 and 12 year old kid.
[01:46:14.206 --> 01:46:17.008]  There are some things in the world that your parents don't know that you know.
[01:46:17.368 --> 01:46:17.948]  You know!
[01:46:18.668 --> 01:46:22.890]  No, they've been brainwashed because the parents were stupid and sent them to a government training camp.
[01:46:22.930 --> 01:46:23.290]  Here we go.
[01:46:24.291 --> 01:46:24.871]  Play that again.
[01:46:24.991 --> 01:46:33.535]  There are some things about our world that you know that older people don't know.
[01:46:33.635 --> 01:46:35.655]  Why would that be?
[01:46:37.236 --> 01:46:39.337]  Well, in a period of rapid change
[01:46:40.699 --> 01:46:41.860]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:44.503]  It goes on and on.
[01:46:44.583 --> 01:46:48.967]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:46:49.347 --> 01:46:51.369]  The point here is
[01:46:59.214 --> 01:47:03.338]  What the children know is playing Spongebob killing carbon dioxide monsters.
[01:47:03.778 --> 01:47:05.499]  What the kids don't know is they're exhaling that.
[01:47:05.539 --> 01:47:07.121]  The whole planet is based on that.
[01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:11.624]  And by the globalists being able to list that as a toxic waste, they're going to be able to regulate and control everything.
[01:47:11.804 --> 01:47:14.546]  Just like there's 10,000 more polar bears today than there was 20 years ago.
[01:47:15.347 --> 01:47:18.348]  Absolutely, and what I find extremely, extremely disgusting
[01:47:36.129 --> 01:47:38.291]  Is that he compared it with the civil rights movement.
[01:47:38.591 --> 01:47:41.474]  Alex, we are the civil rights movement at this point.
[01:47:41.694 --> 01:47:44.036]  We're the ones that are fighting for all of humanity.
[01:47:44.296 --> 01:47:45.457]  For every man, woman and child.
[01:47:45.477 --> 01:47:46.138]  But that's what they do.
[01:47:46.158 --> 01:47:52.904]  They take a legitimate revolution and they integrate a fraudulent revolution of the elite against the people with it.
[01:47:52.924 --> 01:47:53.885]  And that's what they say in Europe.
[01:47:53.905 --> 01:47:55.486]  You'll be arrested in some areas now.
[01:47:55.866 --> 01:47:57.288]  It's called climate denial.
[01:47:59.693 --> 01:48:00.713]  And they're pushing for that.
[01:48:00.933 --> 01:48:07.635]  They're trying to make it like Holocaust denial in other countries where you can literally be arrested for questioning the Holocaust.
[01:48:07.935 --> 01:48:12.597]  If you question global warming, well, you need to be taken to a camp or you need to be re-educated.
[01:48:12.817 --> 01:48:14.297]  This is complete and utter nonsense.
[01:48:14.517 --> 01:48:16.918]  This is against the civil rights movement.
[01:48:17.058 --> 01:48:24.040]  What you're trying to do is appear that the Earth has more rights than actual human beings, and through that appearance,
[01:48:24.793 --> 01:48:29.515]  They will then land-grab, they will then tax you, and they'll really put you to slavery.
[01:48:29.715 --> 01:48:30.795]  They'll put you in a camp.
[01:48:30.955 --> 01:48:34.277]  They'll put you into a compact... And their own documents say this!
[01:48:34.317 --> 01:48:35.477]  This is not our opinion!
[01:48:35.497 --> 01:48:38.338]  That's how everything we say comes true, because we're reading what they're saying!
[01:48:38.718 --> 01:48:42.840]  But they're so arrogant, they know we're playing Spongebob games instead of reading their own documents.
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:45.662]  Jason, we're going to go to break and come back with a big announcement.
[01:48:45.682 --> 01:48:50.366]  I want you to stay with me for that in the final segment that is coming up here in a moment, so stay right there.
[01:48:50.686 --> 01:48:53.949]  Before we go to break, though, again, in this hour, I'm thanking our sponsors.
[01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:59.214]  One of them is efoodsdirect.com, and one of the great packages they've got right now is a three-day food supply for one.
[01:48:59.694 --> 01:49:07.239]  This is a non-GMO, healthy, high-quality food, a three-day food supply for $21.95, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:07.259 --> 01:49:10.621]  That's about a third of the cost of eating for three days for the average person.
[01:49:11.302 --> 01:49:16.826]  Test out their high-quality food by getting their three-day responder pack or get a six-month supply, a year supply.
[01:49:16.846 --> 01:49:18.767]  They have boogie packs that are for a month.
[01:49:18.907 --> 01:49:20.748]  The letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[01:49:20.808 --> 01:49:24.991]  Efoodsdirect.com, big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:25.191]  We're good.
[01:49:45.405 --> 01:49:48.809]  Other products as well, like water filters and stuff, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:49:48.849 --> 01:49:54.294]  It is so important to get that done today, and I just hope that people will take action.
[01:49:54.715 --> 01:49:59.259]  On the same subject of preparedness and getting ready, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:49:59.359 --> 01:50:02.522]  One word, SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call, 877-327-0365.
[01:50:05.285 --> 01:50:11.210]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:50:11.250 --> 01:50:16.755]  There have been times in America, Pilgrims for example, when seeds had the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[01:50:17.075 --> 01:50:19.917]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite.
[01:50:19.937 --> 01:50:21.839]  They're buying up all the companies who want to control
[01:50:22.279 --> 01:50:23.700]  us by controlling the food supply.
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:25.181]  Governments are storing seeds.
[01:50:25.502 --> 01:50:25.882]  The U.N.
[01:50:25.922 --> 01:50:28.003]  is massing them in underground bunkers, seed vaults.
[01:50:28.024 --> 01:50:28.704]  Just Google that.
[01:50:29.184 --> 01:50:31.106]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[01:50:31.146 --> 01:50:31.826]  Give them a call.
[01:50:32.047 --> 01:50:33.348]  They got great packages.
[01:50:33.928 --> 01:50:35.349]  It's just so important to do that.
[01:50:35.369 --> 01:50:35.409]  877-327-0365.
[01:50:35.429 --> 01:50:35.629]  877-327-0365.

[01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.930]  Link up on Infowars.com.
[01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:37.451]  Final segment.

[01:52:07.517 --> 01:52:09.198]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:52:09.498 --> 01:52:12.939]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:14.940]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:18.262]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:52:20.182 --> 01:52:20.983]  We're good to go.

[01:54:09.443 --> 01:54:12.225]  Humanity is built around families and having children.
[01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:17.568]  You know, they try to analyze it scientifically and say it's, you know, our instincts are bad, what we do is bad.
[01:54:17.928 --> 01:54:19.108]  It's how our whole society's based.
[01:54:19.148 --> 01:54:20.189]  It's who we are, it's what we are.
[01:54:20.209 --> 01:54:23.331]  We were just all talking about how great our children are during the break.
[01:54:23.951 --> 01:54:26.252]  So everybody out there, fight the new world order, have more children.
[01:54:26.573 --> 01:54:27.513]  Humans aren't hurting the earth.
[01:54:27.913 --> 01:54:28.994]  Some of the technologies are.
[01:54:29.054 --> 01:54:30.595]  We can develop past those.
[01:54:31.075 --> 01:54:32.736]  Don't let the globalists teach you to hate yourselves.
[01:54:33.216 --> 01:54:34.257]  Well, here's the big announcement.
[01:54:34.277 --> 01:54:35.918]  Let's get Jason Bermas up here on air.
[01:54:35.938 --> 01:54:37.839]  There's a couple other big announcements coming up.
[01:54:38.379 --> 01:54:47.363]  Jason Bermas in a few weeks is moving down here, and he's going to be on the radio 9 to midnight, streamed over the Genesis Communications Network on Starguide satellite.
[01:54:48.063 --> 01:54:52.365]  We're getting our own satellite, our own Starguide with Genesis for 24 hours a day.
[01:54:52.445 --> 01:54:56.407]  Myself, Jason Bermas, and a few other shows that we're going to stick up there on the air.
[01:54:56.847 --> 01:55:03.730]  And so it's going to be an entirely new feed for all the stations out there that want to carry other Genesis programming in association with the info war.
[01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:07.492]  And so Jason's moving down here to do a three-hour nightly show
[01:55:08.332 --> 01:55:10.173]  Uh, right here in this seat where I sit.
[01:55:10.654 --> 01:55:15.076]  And so, when he goes back to visit, uh, he's keeping a place with his roommates up in New York.
[01:55:15.557 --> 01:55:18.679]  When he goes back up there, uh, once a month or so, he'll be doing it, uh, from there.
[01:55:19.099 --> 01:55:21.000]  Though you gotta get a better microphone at that setup there.
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:22.821]  Whatever that tinker toy is, you gotta do good.
[01:55:23.482 --> 01:55:25.763]  Uh, but, uh, so Jason Bermas, there's the announcement.
[01:55:25.783 --> 01:55:26.344]  Pretty exciting.
[01:55:27.304 --> 01:55:28.325]  I am very excited.
[01:55:28.365 --> 01:55:36.470]  You know, Alex, ever since I came across this information, and really came across your film, 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, I mean, it began with this process
[01:55:37.157 --> 01:56:06.091]  of me looking up and verifying these things and then this process of me overcoming my fears literally you know I was waking up in cold sweats you know New York City couple hours away from me growing up around there and for the World Trade Center to be an inside job and all that evidence pointers that was very uncomfortable for me but I got past it and I said you know what I need to do something about this I got involved with loose change it got bigger than you know really anybody could have imagined I you know got to meet you who was
[01:56:06.431 --> 01:56:09.193]  Really, Alex, at the time you were my hero.
[01:56:09.233 --> 01:56:11.335]  You were somebody... Stop it!
[01:56:11.875 --> 01:56:12.996]  It's true, man.
[01:56:13.176 --> 01:56:28.128]  When I watched you in America Destroyed by Design, in the middle of the Grand Canyon, in front of, you know, 50 or so tourists, trying to explain to them that this was no longer our land and that this was given over to the altar of global governance, and just seeing
[01:56:28.608 --> 01:56:29.449]  You know, your guts.
[01:56:29.609 --> 01:56:30.930]  I said, you know what, I can do that.
[01:56:31.170 --> 01:56:33.231]  You know, I've been laughed at before, so what?
[01:56:33.491 --> 01:56:42.777]  You know, a lot of times in history, and really the majority of times in history, those that are laughed at by the majority end up being vindicated much sooner than the majority can see.
[01:56:42.797 --> 01:56:47.340]  Well, Gandhi got laughed at, the abolitionists got laughed at, the Founding Fathers got laughed at.
[01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:50.822]  It always happens, and now people don't laugh if you go to the Grand Canyon and say that.
[01:56:51.182 --> 01:56:55.565]  People aren't laughing anymore because everything we talked about has come true, so now people are paying attention.
[01:56:56.627 --> 01:56:57.769]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:56:57.869 --> 01:57:00.553]  And you know, I'm not here to preach to the choir either, Alex.
[01:57:00.593 --> 01:57:01.274]  I know that you're...
[01:57:01.914 --> 01:57:07.478]  Your audience is enormous and tremendous, but I think this is, more than ever, is a time to bring in the young people.
[01:57:07.599 --> 01:57:15.725]  Okay, we need to bring those people into this information so that they don't join an Obama Youth Corps, so they don't join the military, so they don't join the New World Order.
[01:57:16.005 --> 01:57:17.146]  That's why we're up on our game.
[01:57:17.166 --> 01:57:20.949]  There's a bunch of other new stuff we're going to be announcing in the next month or so as well.
[01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:26.413]  We are gearing up, we are fighting, we are taking action, a lot of new expenses, getting the board ops, everything.
[01:57:26.433 --> 01:57:28.335]  It takes two to run the TV slash radio show.
[01:57:28.755 --> 01:57:31.736]  You know, just with you here, you know, paying your way to get down here so you can live.
[01:57:32.296 --> 01:57:47.240]  All of these things, there's a lot of other expansions we are doing, so we need your financial support with the books and videos at InfoWars.com, with the PrisonPlanet.tv memberships, but more importantly, spreading the word about the radio and TV shows, spreading the word.
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:49.120]  That's how we're growing exponentially.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:52.721]  We can go to the next level, folks, but it's in your hands, it's in your court.
[01:57:53.988 --> 01:58:01.211]  That's right, and you know, we're doing what feels right, and that is expanding and going after not only the youth, but just an entirely new audience.
[01:58:01.251 --> 01:58:05.292]  Because, you know, you look at Ted Anderson, and he's running ads on Rush Limbaugh and Hannity.
[01:58:05.472 --> 01:58:06.872]  That's going to bring us an audience, folks.
[01:58:07.133 --> 01:58:13.675]  We need to keep talking to our neighbors, our friends, and family members, and bring them to this information so that we can save the Republic, Alex.
[01:58:14.523 --> 01:58:22.589]  Absolutely ladies and gentlemen we are putting on our afterburners right into the depression because if we don't expose the bankers are behind it all it's only going to get worse.
[01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:26.132]  Our only chance is to fight these bastards 110 percent.
[01:58:26.532 --> 01:58:31.596]  I want to thank all of you that have joined us in this battle against the new world order and I want to implore
[01:58:31.596 --> 01:58:39.182]  For those of you that have been on the fence to join the fight now, there's only one chance to be part of history and only one chance to defeat evil for yourself and your family.
[01:58:39.222 --> 01:58:46.548]  Rebroadcast with a bunch of huge guests, Dr. Stan Monteith, a volcanologist, JPFO.org, all coming up at Infowars.com.
[01:58:46.588 --> 01:58:47.008]  Take care.
[01:58:47.028 --> 01:58:52.412]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:52.432 --> 01:58:54.233]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:59.123]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:59.223 --> 01:59:03.811]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:59:03.971 --> 01:59:06.716]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:06.936 --> 01:59:09.801]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
