[00:00:01.218 --> 00:00:06.287]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:08.912]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.687]  It is Tuesday, the 8th day of September 2009.
[00:00:23.067 --> 00:00:26.009]  We're now into hour number two.
[00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:35.115]  We just began simulcasting the radio show live on the web at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, FromPrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:35.996 --> 00:00:37.497]  20 minutes with the President.
[00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:51.800]  Written by Charlie Sheen, written in the context of a meeting he would like to have with the President, and the proof and the evidence that we have a cover-up taking place surrounding the tragic attacks of 9-11.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.103]  We're coming up on the 8th anniversary of those tragic attacks here in just a few days.
[00:00:58.963 --> 00:01:05.587]  9-11 has been used as the pretext to set up homeland security, to launch wars in Afghanistan, Iran, now going into Pakistan.
[00:01:06.047 --> 00:01:09.769]  It has been used to put the body scanners that scan your naked body in the airports.
[00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:24.318]  It's been used to put out the DHS reports now saying right-wingers, gun owners, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, are terrorists in the MIAC and DHS reports that we broke when police and others gave us those documents, including a federal marshal.
[00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:30.238]  They said it was for foreigners, you know, supposed terrorists, and now they admit it's for us, the American people.
[00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:33.239]  All of this has been done on the back of 9-11.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.741]  And Obama promised to end the wars.
[00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:40.742]  He promised to stop the torture and secret arrests and indefinite detention.
[00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:42.123]  He's expanding all of that.
[00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:54.128]  And in his letter to the President, Charlie Sheen, in 20 minutes with the President, lays all that out, and it has a bibliography that links to the Washington Post, the Associated Press,
[00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:59.327]  To videos, to audio of six of the ten members.
[00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:11.152]  It's hard to label their dissension as infighting or as a conspiracy theory when six of the ten members are statements of fact.
[00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:19.015]  And you look at what the different members of the commission said.
[00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:33.310]  The statements from Commission Co-Chairman Thomas Keenan, Lee Hamilton, Commissioners Bob Kerrey, Timothy Romer, John Lehman, as well as statements from Commissioner Max Cleland, an ex-Senator from Georgia, who resigned stating, it's a national scandal.
[00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.290]  This investigation is now compromised.
[00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:40.713]  One of these days, we will have to get the full story because the 9-11 issue is so important to America.
[00:02:41.113 --> 00:02:42.794]  But the White House wants to cover it up.
[00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:55.364]  Six of the ten saying this, and two of the five lawyers, the council members, saying they wanted to refer it to the Justice Department for criminal cover-up by the White House and the Pentagon, deliberately lying and covering up.
[00:02:55.644 --> 00:02:56.245]  These are quotes.
[00:02:57.246 --> 00:03:01.709]  He also described President Bush's desire to delay the process is not to damage the 2004 election bid.
[00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.193]  They suspected deception to the point where they considered referring the matter to the Justice Department for criminal investigation.
[00:03:07.613 --> 00:03:11.416]  Mr. President, this information alone is unequivocal grounds for a new investigation.
[00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:18.769]  We're going to go over these quotes coming up in the next hour by the Commission members.
[00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.493]  That is only a small part of what's covered in 20 minutes with the President.
[00:03:24.034 --> 00:03:27.658]  And we have this article up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:27.678 --> 00:03:31.582]  Charlie Sheen requests meeting with Obama over 9-1-1 cover-up.
[00:03:32.383 --> 00:03:35.906]  And he's asking activists to go out to the town halls and the tea parties.
[00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:39.370]  Already one of the largest contingents at Ron Paul events, tea parties.
[00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:44.189]  Our 9-11 truthers.
[00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:49.432]  He's asking We Are Change and 9-11 Truth to go to more events, to go to these town halls.
[00:03:50.252 --> 00:03:56.856]  He's asking the press corps to ask President Obama if he's going to investigate as six of the ten members said needed to be done.
[00:03:57.517 --> 00:04:02.460]  Six of the ten members called for an investigation saying it was all a fraud, a cover-up, a criminal cover-up.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.541]  These are quotes.
[00:04:03.861 --> 00:04:05.702]  This has to be responded to.
[00:04:06.422 --> 00:04:12.166]  He's asking Hollywood people, business people, prominent people, everybody to come out on your blogs, your websites, to the media.
[00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:14.232]  And speak out against this.
[00:04:15.413 --> 00:04:24.040]  He's also asking for President Barack Obama to meet with him and to look at the facts.
[00:04:24.501 --> 00:04:29.605]  In this fictional meeting he wrote up with the President as a way to frame the information and present it.
[00:04:32.388 --> 00:04:34.629]  He hands the President several folders of evidence.
[00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.071]  There's links.
[00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:43.486]  In the 20 bullet points, in the 20 minutes with the President, that give you a 20-20 bird's eye view of what really happened.
[00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:51.249]  So, the public themselves, in the 20 minutes with the President, is being briefed as if they were the President, being given the research, the material.
[00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.251]  The most focused, the most research, damning evidence of 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:02.121]  Now again, Charlie Sheen is going to be live with us tomorrow, live on Friday.
[00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:03.782]  We have a taped interview, audio interview.
[00:05:03.802 --> 00:05:06.223]  We're going to be hearing some clips of the day and tomorrow as well.
[00:05:06.543 --> 00:05:12.567]  We have a video interview we're doing that's going to be up Thursday, where things get ratcheted up.
[00:05:12.827 --> 00:05:16.589]  This is a call to action, a peaceful revolution of information.
[00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:33.498]  The COINTELPRO is going to go crazy, the establishment is going to attack this, the neocons, the George Soros crowd, the controlled left, the controlled right, and the establishment will try to attack through the Patriot, Liberty, 9-1-1 Truth ranks using COINTELPRO, using agents of influence, using jealousy.
[00:05:33.518 --> 00:05:34.158]  It doesn't matter.
[00:05:34.478 --> 00:05:36.539]  You just move forward, get this out.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.561]  Charlie Sheen requests a meeting with President Obama over 9-1-1 cover-up.
[00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:42.402]  Actor demands
[00:05:43.902 --> 00:05:48.844]  Investigation be reopened after majority of 9-11 Commission members say government lied about official story.
[00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:58.488]  And yes, we've had some media call here to the office, some TV and radio and print saying, is Charlie Sheen really write this letter?
[00:05:58.708 --> 00:05:59.788]  Is he really asking for the meeting?
[00:05:59.828 --> 00:06:02.109]  Yes, member, Charlie Sheen came on this show.
[00:06:04.492 --> 00:06:05.794]  Maybe we should re-air that today later.
[00:06:06.354 --> 00:06:10.339]  Came on this radio show in 2006 twice.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.566]  He went to our public 9-11 truth event with over 1,200 people in Los Angeles at the Sheraton in downtown LA.
[00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:22.954]  And yes, he's going to be live on this show several times this week, and there's going to be a videotaped interview with Charlie Sheen.
[00:06:24.298 --> 00:06:30.059]  We didn't want to have all that come out today because we want the main focus to be on the 20 minutes with the President.
[00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:35.760]  Because he knows the media is going to try to go in and dissect what he says in a live interview, twist it, distort it.
[00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:42.102]  So he wants it to be on the 20 minutes because that has the evidence and the documentation.
[00:06:43.242 --> 00:06:47.903]  And it's put in the context of the discussion and debate he'd like to have with the President so it would go viral.
[00:06:50.563 --> 00:06:52.804]  Let's go ahead now and just play a minute and a half clip.
[00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:59.789]  More's coming up with Charlie Sheen, where I interviewed him at his home.
[00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:01.229]  Here it is.
[00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.230]  Charlie, it's great to be here with you.
[00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.231]  Appreciate you doing this interview.
[00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:07.011]  Likewise, Alex.
[00:07:07.031 --> 00:07:07.351]  Thank you.
[00:07:07.751 --> 00:07:12.333]  Why, after three years of silence concerning 9-11, are you now speaking up?
[00:07:12.513 --> 00:07:17.094]  And why have you written this public letter that you've now published?
[00:07:18.194 --> 00:07:19.015]  Well, Alex...
[00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:22.992]  I wrote this letter for two reasons.
[00:07:23.772 --> 00:07:29.535]  Firstly, I wanted to create a public document specifically rooted in fact.
[00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:37.738]  If anybody dares question that, I would encourage those people to scrutinize it, to research it.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.421]  The truth is unchanging, Alex, as we both know.
[00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:48.062]  The only aspect of this piece that had to be manufactured were the President's words.
[00:07:48.663 --> 00:07:54.344]  Everything else will withstand the critical assault I'm more than prepared to endure.
[00:07:55.064 --> 00:08:03.087]  And secondly, this is our first new President since 9-11, and consequently his first 9-11 anniversary in office.
[00:08:05.143 --> 00:08:06.184]  Enough stonewalling.
[00:08:06.244 --> 00:08:08.527]  Enough media manipulation.
[00:08:08.547 --> 00:08:11.210]  Enough media mantra speak.
[00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.733]  The families deserve better, Alex.
[00:08:13.813 --> 00:08:15.695]  America deserves better.
[00:08:15.715 --> 00:08:16.476]  I mean, come on.
[00:08:17.076 --> 00:08:17.877]  Come on, people.
[00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:22.703]  The 9-11 Commission Report is a blatant work of manipulation, secrecy, and fiction.
[00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:25.410]  Come on, the time is now.
[00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.971]  Demand the truth.
[00:08:27.991 --> 00:08:36.296]  I personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like a new investigation is just going to fall out of the heavens right into our Congress.
[00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:37.957]  We have to take action.
[00:08:38.257 --> 00:08:39.217]  We have to stand as one.
[00:08:39.237 --> 00:08:42.439]  We must insist that our new president deliver on his promises.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.822]  All right, and that is from a 20-plus minute interview.
[00:08:48.262 --> 00:08:51.904]  Again, taped interviews, video interviews, live interviews, all coming up this week.
[00:08:51.924 --> 00:08:52.645]  More coming up later.
[00:08:53.703 --> 00:08:59.447]  That is actor, director, family man, freedom lover, Charlie Sheen.
[00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:09.134]  And I will give you again the same quote that I quoted live on CNN with A.J.
[00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.375]  Hammer back in 2006, the Mark Twain quote.
[00:09:13.365 --> 00:09:17.947]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned.
[00:09:18.707 --> 00:09:25.591]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:27.571]  Charlie Sheen, we salute your courage.
[00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:29.232]  We salute what you've done.
[00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:33.034]  And we salute everybody out there that is taking 20 minutes with the President.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:42.164]  And the other article, Charlie Sheen requests meeting with Obama over 9-1-1 cover-up and getting it out to everybody right now.
[00:09:42.264 --> 00:09:45.385]  This is so, so essential.
[00:09:45.465 --> 00:09:53.449]  If you missed part of that or just tuned in, coming up later, in fact we'll do it right at the bottom of the hour, I will re-air that.
[00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.951]  And we'll also take that snippet.
[00:09:56.923 --> 00:10:08.331]  Where I just introduced it and played it and posted it up on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube and also in higher quality for folks that were watching live at PrisonPlanet.tv and this will all be archived up on the site today.
[00:10:08.931 --> 00:10:13.194]  I want to get into the statements by six of the ten 9-11 Commission members saying it was a cover-up and a line of fraud.
[00:10:13.214 --> 00:10:20.619]  I want to get into two of the five counsels, the lawyers, saying it was all a fraud and a lie and they knew it was a criminal cover-up.
[00:10:21.843 --> 00:10:26.568]  I want to go over the 20 minutes with the President coming up today as well.
[00:10:26.588 --> 00:10:28.149]  Then we're going to open the phones up.
[00:10:28.189 --> 00:10:29.410]  They're not open right now.
[00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.152]  They're not open yet.
[00:10:32.153 --> 00:10:36.137]  So that is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:39.465 --> 00:10:55.816]  This is just amazing, though, to be part of this and to be here seeing this happening, because if other prominent people and just the general public learn that they can put posters up on street corners, they can call in to talk radio, they can go to town halls, that they can go to events, it will bring the system to its knees.
[00:10:56.076 --> 00:10:56.896]  What have I always said?
[00:10:56.916 --> 00:10:57.897]  People say, what are solutions?
[00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:58.838]  I say local control.
[00:10:59.378 --> 00:11:03.801]  We have 30-plus states moving or who've already passed resolutions against federal
[00:11:05.384 --> 00:11:06.164]  We're good to go.
[00:11:23.029 --> 00:11:24.050]  Think about 9-11 Truth.
[00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.452]  Day one I came on air and I said they staged the attacks.
[00:11:26.492 --> 00:11:27.032]  Go public.
[00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:32.457]  We've got to found 9-11 Truth to tell the truth that they'll stage more terror attacks and use this for total control.
[00:11:32.857 --> 00:11:35.980]  Again, another example of the vision, the idea, taking action.
[00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:36.881]  It's simple.
[00:11:37.001 --> 00:11:37.541]  I know history.
[00:11:37.682 --> 00:11:39.043]  I knew we could have victories.
[00:11:39.363 --> 00:11:47.070]  And the last year I've been saying go to, more than that, I've been saying go to city halls, go to county commissioners, go to public events, go see your congressman.
[00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.713]  All those videos of me back in the late 90s confronting Congressman Lloyd Doggett and others.
[00:11:50.993 --> 00:11:52.575]  By myself, now it's hundreds doing it.
[00:11:53.056 --> 00:11:54.097]  That's the idea.
[00:11:54.318 --> 00:11:56.321]  The people seeing the power they have.
[00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.424]  This is about the people standing up.
[00:11:58.724 --> 00:11:59.245]  We'll be right back.
[00:12:00.922 --> 00:12:04.523]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:12:04.703 --> 00:12:14.685]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:12:14.845 --> 00:12:22.067]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[00:12:22.307 --> 00:12:36.437]  If you're ready to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then you're ready for Heart and Body Extract from Healthy Hearts Club.
[00:12:36.597 --> 00:12:47.004]  Heart and Body Extract has a 23-year proven track record of using certified organic herbs that make up an excellent formula to balance and support the heart and circulatory system.
[00:12:47.064 --> 00:12:48.985]  In as little as two weeks, you can feel
[00:12:49.706 --> 00:12:57.253]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:12:57.313 --> 00:13:09.204]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:13:14.452 --> 00:13:20.637]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:20.957 --> 00:13:22.859]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:25.441]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:25.501 --> 00:13:36.450]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.371]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:38.772 --> 00:13:40.133]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:13:40.606 --> 00:13:46.951]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:13:47.511 --> 00:13:55.296]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:55.777 --> 00:13:56.918]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:57.358 --> 00:13:58.559]  The people strike back.
[00:14:00.788 --> 00:14:04.454]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:14:04.874 --> 00:14:10.302]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:14:10.763 --> 00:14:11.824]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:14:11.864 --> 00:14:15.910]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:14:16.551 --> 00:14:29.879]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.683]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:14:35.983 --> 00:14:41.847]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:14:42.607 --> 00:14:43.869]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:43.889 --> 00:14:45.590]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:45.970]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:48.052]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:14:48.072 --> 00:14:48.132]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:15:00.237 --> 00:15:03.400]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.481]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:11.006]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:15:11.226 --> 00:15:18.952]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:28.560]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.862]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.
[00:15:32.042 --> 00:15:36.945]  Renaissance Charge offers a full line of products made in the USA for all types and sizes of batteries.
[00:15:37.245 --> 00:15:42.448]  Find out why our customers tell us the Renaissance Charger is the only battery charger they will ever use.
[00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:43.488]  Save your money.
[00:15:43.868 --> 00:15:44.809]  Save the environment.
[00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:48.032]  Visit us online at r-charge.com.
[00:15:48.212 --> 00:15:50.294]  That's r-charge.com.
[00:15:50.435 --> 00:15:51.175]  Or call us at 989-637-4179.
[00:15:51.215 --> 00:15:51.656]  That's 989-637-4179.
[00:15:51.676 --> 00:15:52.997]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[00:16:14.315 --> 00:16:19.319]  Twenty minutes with the President by Charlie Sheen.
[00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:31.550]  It is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and it's done in the format of a conversation with the President.
[00:16:32.273 --> 00:16:39.840]  So that people will actually read it all and look at it and ask themselves why this is never asked to the president.
[00:16:40.421 --> 00:16:42.843]  Asking themselves why there hasn't been a new investigation.
[00:16:43.143 --> 00:16:47.808]  You put out another article of the tens of thousands that have been put out laying out all the facts, it gets ignored.
[00:16:47.908 --> 00:16:48.708]  This way it will be get...
[00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:50.357]  A lot of attention.
[00:16:50.617 --> 00:16:52.379]  That's how public relations works.
[00:16:52.999 --> 00:16:54.641]  And that's why we've done it this way.
[00:16:54.661 --> 00:16:56.202]  That's why Charlie Sheen has done it this way.
[00:16:56.222 --> 00:16:59.405]  And we're going to be putting out a press release in the next hour.
[00:17:00.086 --> 00:17:11.777]  Again, we're asking everybody to go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and get 20 minutes with the President and email it out to everybody, get it out to everybody, post it everywhere.
[00:17:12.597 --> 00:17:15.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is so important.
[00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:20.186]  Coming up, I'm going to play that clip of Charlie Sheen again, talking about why he wrote 20 Minutes with the President.
[00:17:20.827 --> 00:17:31.210]  And again, he's coming up live tomorrow, and then on Friday we have a video that I shot with Charlie a week and a half ago out in Los Angeles where he speaks directly.
[00:17:32.537 --> 00:17:33.017]  Well, you'll see.
[00:17:33.057 --> 00:17:35.858]  I'm going to leave that as a surprise, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:41.901]  And again, this 20 minutes with the President is only the opening salvo to get the President's attention.
[00:17:41.941 --> 00:17:45.442]  A genius idea, really is genius, by Charlie Sheen.
[00:17:46.323 --> 00:17:52.485]  And I can't wait to see how the media and the COINTELPRO try to spin this, but that'll only give us more attention.
[00:17:53.066 --> 00:17:57.848]  So it's also designed, really, to have the neocons and other people attack it and take the bait.
[00:17:58.408 --> 00:18:00.029]  And they just can't help themselves.
[00:18:01.249 --> 00:18:05.352]  Again, all the people attacking, that only feeds in to making it that much bigger of a story.
[00:18:05.393 --> 00:18:06.253]  That's what we're counting on.
[00:18:06.674 --> 00:18:07.514]  We want to be quite honest.
[00:18:07.534 --> 00:18:09.336]  I'm not letting any secret out there.
[00:18:09.376 --> 00:18:13.779]  The establishment knows how things work, but they just can't help themselves.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.961]  Send it to Bill O'Reilly.
[00:18:16.401 --> 00:18:17.582]  Send it to Sean Hannity.
[00:18:18.343 --> 00:18:19.744]  Try to call into Sean Hannity's show.
[00:18:19.764 --> 00:18:20.865]  Try to call into Bill O'Reilly.
[00:18:20.965 --> 00:18:21.906]  He quit his radio show.
[00:18:21.966 --> 00:18:22.606]  Somebody listen to it.
[00:18:23.127 --> 00:18:24.268]  Call into Glenn Beck.
[00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:27.251]  Get him to discuss it, get him to talk about it.
[00:18:27.291 --> 00:18:30.894]  In fact, there's a video I want to play coming up to really show people who the real Glenn Beck is.
[00:18:31.895 --> 00:18:36.580]  Glenn Beck, neocon, not libertarian.
[00:18:37.543 --> 00:18:41.385]  And so we will go over that as well.
[00:18:41.965 --> 00:18:49.149]  But again, this is done in the context of an open letter to the President of the conversation Charlie Sheen would like to have with him.
[00:18:49.189 --> 00:18:51.250]  He is asking for the meeting.
[00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.452]  And Charlie wrote this the way he sees politicians with their canned
[00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:56.692]  Answers.
[00:18:56.752 --> 00:19:06.560]  Many of these answers are actual answers or paraphrase answers that Obama and Bush and other politicians have given when they've been confronted with these issues or even small pieces of this.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.282]  They just say, oh, it's a conspiracy, don't look at it.
[00:19:08.542 --> 00:19:18.870]  It's not a conspiracy theory that six of the ten 9-11 Commission members and two of the five council members, the lawyers, have come out saying it's complete cover-up and a complete fraud.
[00:19:19.511 --> 00:19:21.573]  And we're going over the 20 minutes with the President first.
[00:19:22.668 --> 00:19:28.052]  So that, in the context of this, people will look at the evidence in the bibliography.
[00:19:28.412 --> 00:19:29.933]  That is what this is all about.
[00:19:30.233 --> 00:19:34.316]  Then, of course, the establishment will take the bait to want to attack Charlie Sheen.
[00:19:34.336 --> 00:19:39.600]  I mean, he really is the perfect person, because they'll love a few things in his background to go after him.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.380]  Charlie knows that.
[00:19:43.002 --> 00:19:48.446]  It's about the information in the letter, though, as he said in the piece describing it.
[00:19:50.211 --> 00:19:51.351]  20 minutes with the President.
[00:19:51.412 --> 00:19:55.973]  So we're going to come back and read over 20 minutes with the President.
[00:19:56.073 --> 00:19:57.254]  It's very, very lengthy.
[00:19:57.854 --> 00:19:58.414]  Pretty lengthy.
[00:19:59.254 --> 00:19:59.875]  How many pages is it?
[00:19:59.895 --> 00:20:00.695]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 pages long.
[00:20:00.715 --> 00:20:04.236]  If you want to get technical, it's about 15 and a half pages long.
[00:20:17.723 --> 00:20:20.466]  And it is already spreading all over the web.
[00:20:20.486 --> 00:20:21.346]  I want to thank everybody.
[00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:29.073]  It's already a huge success, just four hours into its launch today.
[00:20:32.216 --> 00:20:36.039]  And it's even more perfect that they happen to be hyping up the whole Van Jones thing.
[00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:43.246]  He was going to resign over calling Republicans names, over saying he was a communist, over saying that it's really total wealth redistribution.
[00:20:45.223 --> 00:20:45.443]  I don't
[00:21:03.516 --> 00:21:06.037]  And go, oh look, you know, Charlie didn't really talk to the President.
[00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:07.037]  Well, it says right there he didn't.
[00:21:07.717 --> 00:21:09.658]  But it says this is the meeting he'd like to have.
[00:21:10.338 --> 00:21:21.301]  And then people in mass will see the evidence in it within the second page, read those quotes with links to the Washington Post and other mainstream publications where the 9-11 Commission members are saying it's a complete total fraud.
[00:21:22.561 --> 00:21:25.422]  60% of the 9-11 Commission members.
[00:21:25.442 --> 00:21:28.183]  And what's 2 out of 5 with the Council members?
[00:21:28.823 --> 00:21:29.263]  What is that, 35%?
[00:21:32.771 --> 00:21:33.471]  Or two-fifths?
[00:21:34.532 --> 00:21:47.236]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come right back after this quick break, play that Charlie Sheen clip again, brand new clip, and a lot more, right here on the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:54.398]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:55.338 --> 00:21:58.019]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.501 --> 00:22:05.667]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:22:05.807 --> 00:22:10.172]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:22:10.332 --> 00:22:12.194]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:22:12.615 --> 00:22:13.956]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:22:14.237 --> 00:22:15.278]  There is a solution.
[00:22:15.498 --> 00:22:23.522]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:22:23.922 --> 00:22:31.005]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:22:37.428 --> 00:22:43.011]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:22:43.431 --> 00:22:47.233]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[00:23:00.606 --> 00:23:04.590]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.632]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:15.140]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:23:15.381 --> 00:23:20.606]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:23:20.926 --> 00:23:22.548]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:23:22.788 --> 00:23:29.109]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:23:29.289 --> 00:23:40.052]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:23:40.332 --> 00:23:40.852]  That's right.
[00:23:41.112 --> 00:23:43.432]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:45.453]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-HELP.
[00:23:47.213 --> 00:23:47.594]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:23:47.614 --> 00:23:51.200]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.763]  That's acolablue.com.
[00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.011]  There's a guy named M.Z.
[00:24:02.071 --> 00:24:05.234]  in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:24:05.454 --> 00:24:07.876]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:24:08.016 --> 00:24:17.564]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life, that even when you do a great job for someone, and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:24:17.704 --> 00:24:23.589]  You are always in danger of losing your job, unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:26.391]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:24:26.591 --> 00:24:27.432]  So M.Z.
[00:24:27.472 --> 00:24:28.973]  has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[00:24:30.114 --> 00:24:30.434]  I think so.
[00:24:52.814 --> 00:24:54.116]  OwnMyself.com.
[00:24:54.276 --> 00:24:55.337]  It takes very little money.
[00:24:55.457 --> 00:24:57.900]  And if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.202]  Remember, Chocolate.OwnMyself.com.
[00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.712]  CNN during the break is covering Bigfoot caught on tape.
[00:25:14.372 --> 00:25:17.914]  Talk about shoddy journalism and staged stunts.
[00:25:18.394 --> 00:25:19.675]  They do this every single day.
[00:25:19.775 --> 00:25:22.797]  We're countering them with our own operation.
[00:25:22.857 --> 00:25:34.063]  Charlie Sheen calling on the activists of America to come out for 9-11 truth, to come out against the ward, to come out against the secret arrest, the police state, all of it.
[00:25:35.256 --> 00:25:42.278]  In fact, I want to air coming up a few minutes from our 2006 interview with Charlie Sheen.
[00:25:42.298 --> 00:25:45.319]  Then I'm going to read 20 Minutes with the President and open the phones up next hour.
[00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:55.182]  But let's go ahead now and re-air a minute and a half of the interview I did with Charlie Sheen, an audio interview, a few weeks ago.
[00:25:55.202 --> 00:26:02.984]  And then again, there's a video interview I did a week and a half ago, and then live interviews with him coming up as well tomorrow and on Friday.
[00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:07.911]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to the clip where he explains the letter.
[00:26:08.591 --> 00:26:09.531]  Here it is, Charlie Sheen.
[00:26:10.772 --> 00:26:12.053]  Charlie, it's great to be here with you.
[00:26:12.373 --> 00:26:14.053]  Appreciate you doing this interview.
[00:26:14.194 --> 00:26:14.834]  Likewise, Alex.
[00:26:14.854 --> 00:26:15.154]  Thank you.
[00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:20.156]  Why, after three years of silence concerning 9-11, are you now speaking up?
[00:26:20.336 --> 00:26:24.918]  And why have you written this public letter that you've now published?
[00:26:26.019 --> 00:26:26.839]  Well, Alex...
[00:26:28.644 --> 00:26:30.826]  I wrote this letter for two reasons.
[00:26:31.587 --> 00:26:37.373]  Firstly, I wanted to create a public document specifically rooted in fact.
[00:26:38.134 --> 00:26:45.582]  If anybody dares question that, I would encourage those people to scrutinize it, to research it.
[00:26:47.316 --> 00:26:50.199]  The truth is unchanging, Alex, as we both know.
[00:26:50.219 --> 00:26:55.883]  The only aspect of this piece that had to be manufactured were the President's words.
[00:26:56.484 --> 00:27:02.189]  Everything else will withstand the critical assault I'm more than prepared to endure.
[00:27:02.889 --> 00:27:10.916]  And secondly, this is our first new President since 9-11, and consequently his first 9-11 anniversary in office.
[00:27:12.975 --> 00:27:14.016]  Enough stonewalling.
[00:27:14.076 --> 00:27:16.338]  Enough media manipulation.
[00:27:16.358 --> 00:27:19.040]  Enough media mantra speak.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.562]  The families deserve better, Alex.
[00:27:21.642 --> 00:27:23.523]  America deserves better.
[00:27:23.543 --> 00:27:24.304]  I mean, come on.
[00:27:24.884 --> 00:27:25.685]  Come on, people.
[00:27:25.725 --> 00:27:30.669]  The 9-11 Commission report is a blatant work of manipulation, secrecy, and fiction.
[00:27:31.661 --> 00:27:33.382]  Come on, the time is now.
[00:27:33.482 --> 00:27:35.043]  Demand the truth.
[00:27:35.843 --> 00:27:44.268]  I personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like a new investigation is just going to fall out of the heavens right into our Congress.
[00:27:44.668 --> 00:27:45.888]  We have to take action.
[00:27:46.229 --> 00:27:47.169]  We have to stand as one.
[00:27:47.189 --> 00:27:50.391]  We must insist that our new president deliver on his promises.
[00:27:52.092 --> 00:27:55.813]  All right, Charlie Sheen, and he is asking you, he's going public.
[00:27:56.414 --> 00:27:57.955]  He's asking for a meeting with the president.
[00:27:57.995 --> 00:28:00.516]  He wrote an article with the facts in it.
[00:28:01.658 --> 00:28:03.299]  Of what he believes that meeting might be like.
[00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:11.583]  And, 20 minutes with the President, get it out to everybody, and the article, Charlie Sheen requests meeting with Obama over 9-1-1 cover-up.
[00:28:13.403 --> 00:28:14.024]  It's up to you.
[00:28:14.084 --> 00:28:16.225]  The ball is in your court.
[00:28:16.865 --> 00:28:22.488]  Ladies and gentlemen, the establishment will try to divert, distract, turn all their armies to come and tell pro-people loose.
[00:28:22.848 --> 00:28:26.169]  That's because they're scared of this information.
[00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.670]  And this is only the opening salvo.
[00:28:29.531 --> 00:28:29.771]  Okay?
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:38.045]  And for the mainstream media calling, yes, Charlie Sheen wrote the letter, he wrote the piece, and you just heard Charlie Sheen saying that right there.
[00:28:38.085 --> 00:28:41.148]  The media will even try to deny that Charlie Sheen even wrote that letter.
[00:28:41.548 --> 00:28:45.371]  That appears to be one of the spins that they are putting out.
[00:28:45.908 --> 00:28:46.988]  Which is what we expected.
[00:28:47.608 --> 00:28:57.091]  And look for all sorts of... I mean, if they threaten to arrest Mark Cuban over this behind-the-scenes, just talking about putting out loose-change Final Cut with me, Charlie, and loose-change guys, God knows what they'll try here.
[00:28:57.191 --> 00:29:02.852]  We know we're going into a very, very serious storm here, but we're doing it because no pain, no gain.
[00:29:03.572 --> 00:29:09.174]  Fortune favors the bold, and the fortune we want is liberty and freedom for our children, and our children's children for our future.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:16.302]  Now, I've got some media I need to talk to, and we're working on some other issues.
[00:29:17.262 --> 00:29:19.302]  While I do that for five minutes, we're going to play this Glenn Beck piece.
[00:29:19.322 --> 00:29:21.403]  I was stunned by how good it was last night when I saw it.
[00:29:21.423 --> 00:29:23.024]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:29:23.444 --> 00:29:24.964]  Showing you the fake right wing.
[00:29:25.204 --> 00:29:31.886]  How Beck comes in and says he's anti-New World Order, but then at key areas, at key points, he supports the banker takeover, bailout.
[00:29:32.566 --> 00:29:33.807]  He says arrest patriots.
[00:29:33.847 --> 00:29:35.047]  He badmouths Ron Paul.
[00:29:36.977 --> 00:29:42.099]  And it's got some clips showing Napolitano, who's got a much better record of actually being a patriot than Glenn Beck does.
[00:29:42.219 --> 00:29:47.501]  And I guess that's why Napolitano, they kind of keep him on the internet for Fox TV and occasionally fills in for Beck.
[00:29:48.762 --> 00:29:49.682]  So I want to play this clip.
[00:29:49.702 --> 00:29:53.023]  We'll see what Glenn Beck does with his Charlie Sheen situation.
[00:29:53.323 --> 00:29:59.145]  Then we're going to cue up that 19, that 2006 interview with Charlie Sheen and play a little bit of that.
[00:29:59.446 --> 00:30:02.007]  And then coming up, 20 minutes with the president.
[00:30:02.627 --> 00:30:05.368]  So here is the video titled
[00:30:07.113 --> 00:30:08.974]  Glenn Beck is a neocon, not a libertarian.
[00:30:09.695 --> 00:30:10.175]  Here it is.
[00:30:10.615 --> 00:30:26.405]  The Patriot Act is the most dastardly direct assault on human liberty and on guaranteed rights in the Constitution that the Congress ever enacted since the Alien and Sedition Acts 200 years earlier.
[00:30:28.758 --> 00:30:32.782]  All efforts by the government to bail out private industry are unconstitutional.
[00:30:33.222 --> 00:30:34.704]  The reasons are profound.
[00:30:35.004 --> 00:30:36.906]  They're grounded in the Constitution.
[00:30:37.206 --> 00:30:41.810]  I'm a dope, I'm a rodeo clown, I'm a recovering alcoholic!
[00:30:50.558 --> 00:30:52.780]  I believe so deeply in our Constitution.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.301]  I was for the Patriot Act.
[00:30:55.361 --> 00:30:57.883]  You know that I am actually a libertarian at heart.
[00:30:58.283 --> 00:31:00.285]  I think the bailout is the right thing to do.
[00:31:00.305 --> 00:31:02.786]  I believe so deeply in our Constitution.
[00:31:03.327 --> 00:31:04.768]  I was for the Patriot Act.
[00:31:04.988 --> 00:31:08.850]  You know that I am actually a libertarian at heart.
[00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:17.096]  The 700 billion dollars that you're hearing about now is not only, I believe, necessary, it is also not nearly enough.
[00:31:17.136 --> 00:31:20.038]  There was one guy last year that was Ron Paul.
[00:31:23.376 --> 00:31:27.891]  When you were on CNN, you would act like he was kind of a crazy kooky guy.
[00:31:28.112 --> 00:31:29.958]  I still act like he's a crazy kooky guy.
[00:31:31.977 --> 00:31:33.358]  The Ron Paul Revolution.
[00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:39.922]  I think it's meant to be a catchy slogan, but I fear some of his fringe supporters are taking the word revolution too literally.
[00:31:40.322 --> 00:31:46.566]  Hey Glenn, real quick, how did you and your network benefit from associating Ron Paul supporters with domestic terrorism?
[00:31:46.606 --> 00:31:53.890]  When you were escorted out, after asking him your question, Glenn Beck stopped, turned to the crowd, and started applauding.
[00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:57.953]  What you're about to hear is the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment.
[00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:03.029]  This is the Glenn Beck Program.
[00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:07.512]  The man has total credence when it comes to the economy.
[00:32:08.053 --> 00:32:12.376]  The man does not necessarily have credence when it comes to the war on terror.
[00:32:12.476 --> 00:32:17.620]  And Tim there suggests that we think of the economy, but not in foreign policy.
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.781]  You can't do that.
[00:32:19.421 --> 00:32:20.242]  They're one and the same.
[00:32:20.262 --> 00:32:21.503]  That's where all the money's going.
[00:32:22.051 --> 00:32:27.015]  Have you seen any of the, uh, the stuff that Glenn Beck has been doing?
[00:32:27.035 --> 00:32:31.058]  He is, uh, you know, on occasion is a Democrat, you know.
[00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:32.199]  Religious fanatics!
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.221]  They're incapacitating people!
[00:32:34.261 --> 00:32:36.243]  Does Hitler come to mind?
[00:32:36.263 --> 00:32:38.004]  For the love of our children!
[00:32:38.244 --> 00:32:40.086]  And they are preparing a holocaust.
[00:32:40.826 --> 00:32:42.308]  Uh, the second holocaust.
[00:32:42.708 --> 00:32:44.930]  He has been, uh, very discourteous.
[00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:49.554]  You're about to hear his confusion of entertainment and enlightenment.
[00:32:50.615 --> 00:32:55.179]  Earlier today, I had the opportunity to sit down in the Oval Office with the President of the United States.
[00:32:55.579 --> 00:33:00.463]  President Bush is a man who personally feels the pain of every lost soldier.
[00:33:01.103 --> 00:33:04.486]  I can tell you that the President has incredible passion and resolve.
[00:33:04.906 --> 00:33:14.394]  Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere.
[00:33:17.336 --> 00:33:18.577]  That is the real story tonight.
[00:33:19.057 --> 00:33:19.578]  Back in a minute.
[00:33:23.379 --> 00:33:25.341]  Neocon, not libertarian.
[00:33:25.501 --> 00:33:26.682]  I just wanted to get that out there.
[00:33:26.742 --> 00:33:31.926]  Now, obviously, folks, I'm not going to just cover 20 minutes with the President and Charlie Sheen today, though more of that's coming up.
[00:33:32.527 --> 00:33:34.208]  This is the type of news we have in our stack.
[00:33:34.488 --> 00:33:36.570]  From being called kooks just a few years ago to now.
[00:33:36.991 --> 00:33:38.832]  Question a doctor, lose your child.
[00:33:38.872 --> 00:33:41.715]  Times of London, same thing happening in the United States.
[00:33:42.355 --> 00:33:50.162]  If your daughter dies or gets paralyzed from the Gardashil shot, even though they admit it's killing and paralyzing people, the CPS then comes and takes your other children.
[00:33:50.602 --> 00:33:51.283]  That's what they were told.
[00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.612]  Labor's secret plan to send overweight children to NHS fat camps.
[00:33:55.932 --> 00:33:57.593]  Taking your kids to raise them in the dormitories.
[00:33:58.313 --> 00:34:00.735]  UN wants new global currency to replace dollar.
[00:34:01.095 --> 00:34:01.896]  London Telegraph.
[00:34:02.096 --> 00:34:03.016]  Open announcement.
[00:34:03.336 --> 00:34:04.117]  We told you this!
[00:34:04.657 --> 00:34:08.519]  This is what Fall of the Republic, my new film coming out October 21st, is all about.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.200]  See?
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.281]  Global currency.
[00:34:11.361 --> 00:34:12.181]  World government.
[00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:14.803]  The very bankers that engineered the Ponzi scheme setting this up.
[00:34:16.013 --> 00:34:17.614]  Eco Nanny State.
[00:34:18.015 --> 00:34:18.835]  Nancy Pelosi.
[00:34:18.915 --> 00:34:21.297]  Every aspect of our lives will be subjected to an inventory.
[00:34:21.317 --> 00:34:21.718]  Remember that?
[00:34:22.658 --> 00:34:24.820]  France mulls CO2 taxes on citizens.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.422]  A bunch of other European countries.
[00:34:26.682 --> 00:34:30.845]  Germany's environment minister says you will pay a carbon tax on everything you do.
[00:34:31.145 --> 00:34:33.627]  A national ID card will be used to track everything you do.
[00:34:34.028 --> 00:34:36.009]  I told you that a decade ago because Club of Rome said it.
[00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.274]  German government advisor again proposes personal CO2 budget for everyone on planet.
[00:34:42.136 --> 00:34:46.137]  Michael Moore says capitalism is evil, says new Michael Moore film, a guy that's worth $400 million.
[00:34:47.218 --> 00:34:49.058]  See, the big banks are the monopoly men.
[00:34:49.118 --> 00:34:50.959]  They want socialism and communism for you.
[00:34:51.019 --> 00:34:53.200]  They take your wealth and suck it offshore.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.481]  That is just some of what's coming up today.
[00:34:58.361 --> 00:35:01.522]  Again, you just heard the live, first time, you know, aired here on the radio.
[00:35:01.542 --> 00:35:03.063]  We just played an interview I did with Charlie Sheen.
[00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:08.079]  Live interviews with him actually on via the phone coming up in the next few days.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.682]  More of the taped interviews, the videotaped interviews, that's all coming up.
[00:35:11.702 --> 00:35:18.007]  But I wanted to bring people back because I got a bunch of emails this morning saying, you know, Charlie Sheen didn't write this letter.
[00:35:18.668 --> 00:35:19.729]  You don't know Charlie Sheen.
[00:35:19.789 --> 00:35:23.852]  People forget that he went public for 9-11 Truth on this show three years ago in 2006.
[00:35:25.816 --> 00:35:26.176]  We're good to go.
[00:35:42.674 --> 00:35:44.016]  I don't know.
[00:36:03.374 --> 00:36:05.356]  Plus, a Charlie Sheen shocker.
[00:36:05.696 --> 00:36:07.838]  Tonight, the actor's stunning statements on 9-11.
[00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:11.582]  Maybe the airplanes did not take down the Twin Towers.
[00:36:11.962 --> 00:36:14.505]  And maybe the government is covering it all up.
[00:36:14.765 --> 00:36:21.352]  Taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75% of their targets, that feels like a conspiracy theory.
[00:36:21.792 --> 00:36:24.535]  Showbiz Tonight investigates the startling allegations.
[00:36:25.536 --> 00:36:27.918]  Of course, you remember where you were on September 11th.
[00:36:28.458 --> 00:36:29.439]  Oh, absolutely, AJ.
[00:36:29.459 --> 00:36:34.984]  I was at work at CNN in Atlanta, and I remember being in complete and utter shock and dismay.
[00:36:35.004 --> 00:36:41.751]  Yeah, I was working as well here in New York City, and like most people, just thinking, this is absolutely unbelievable.
[00:36:42.091 --> 00:36:46.514]  Well, there's another thing that you may not believe about September 11th and what someone is saying.
[00:36:46.574 --> 00:36:55.541]  Charlie Sheen, star of CBS's successful sitcom, Two and a Half Men, says, point blank, 9-11, the Pentagon, the World Trade Center, all a cover-up.
[00:36:55.941 --> 00:36:56.621]  Is this for real?
[00:36:56.721 --> 00:37:00.204]  Well, showbiz tonight has the tape that has people asking, what's the truth?
[00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:12.629]  The more you look at stuff, especially specific incidents, specific events, in or around the fateful day, it just raises a lot of questions.
[00:37:13.169 --> 00:37:21.715]  Charlie Sheen has his own questions about 9-11, and Showbiz Tonight has obtained the explosive interview from the radio show of fringe journalist Alex Jones.
[00:37:22.296 --> 00:37:26.819]  Sheen normally gets laughs as The Bachelor on the hit CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:27.780]  Wow.
[00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:30.602]  You're even better than a dog.
[00:37:32.253 --> 00:37:36.816]  But now, Sheen is courting controversy by questioning the official story on 9-11.
[00:37:36.836 --> 00:37:42.199]  We're not the conspiracy theorists on this particular issue, you know?
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:52.446]  It seems to me like, you know, 19 amateurs with box cutters taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75% of their targets.
[00:37:53.367 --> 00:37:54.968]  That feels like a conspiracy theory.
[00:37:55.488 --> 00:37:57.770]  So, what exactly are Sheen's questions about 9-11?
[00:37:59.585 --> 00:38:04.228]  For one, Sheen is questioning the official story of what caused the World Trade Center collapse.
[00:38:04.568 --> 00:38:08.911]  That the impact of the two planes caused fires that weakened the building's support columns.
[00:38:09.451 --> 00:38:15.996]  In the interview, Sheen says he wondered if the buildings could have been brought down by a deliberate, yes, deliberate implosion.
[00:38:16.356 --> 00:38:17.997]  I saw the South Tower hit live.
[00:38:19.338 --> 00:38:23.400]  That famous wide shot where it disappears behind the building, and then we see the tremendous fireball.
[00:38:23.861 --> 00:38:26.142]  And it was just a, there was a feeling that
[00:38:28.604 --> 00:38:38.692]  It didn't look, how do I say this, didn't look like any commercial jetliner I've flown on any time in my life.
[00:38:39.013 --> 00:38:41.255]  And then when the buildings came down...
[00:38:42.688 --> 00:38:46.491]  Later on that day, I was with my brother, and I said, hey, call me insane.
[00:38:47.192 --> 00:38:52.897]  But did it sort of look like those buildings came down in a controlled demolition?
[00:38:53.478 --> 00:38:57.181]  Sheen is also questioning how a commercial airliner could have hit the Pentagon.
[00:38:57.841 --> 00:39:00.223]  Show us this incredible maneuvering.
[00:39:00.804 --> 00:39:01.745]  Just show it to us.
[00:39:02.492 --> 00:39:07.135]  Just show us, you know, how this particular plane pulled off these maneuvers.
[00:39:07.275 --> 00:39:07.955]  What was it?
[00:39:07.975 --> 00:39:19.543]  A 270 degree turn at 500 miles an hour, descending 7,000 feet in two and a half minutes, skimming across the treetops the last 500 meters, four feet off the ground.
[00:39:20.243 --> 00:39:24.824]  Sheen also jumped on a favorite target of 9-11 conspiracy theorists, President Bush.
[00:39:25.344 --> 00:39:31.726]  Sheen questions why the President, after an aide told him about the attacks, continued with his Florida school appearance.
[00:39:32.426 --> 00:39:44.589]  It seemed to me that upon the revelation of that news, that the Secret Service would grab the President and remove him as if he were on fire from that room.
[00:39:46.098 --> 00:39:51.479]  Ever since that horrible day, conspiracy theories about the attacks have spread far and wide through the internet.
[00:39:51.859 --> 00:39:56.360]  As writer Webster Tarpley tells Showbiz Tonight, Sheen is not alone in his opinions.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:12.524]  There was a Zogby poll that was carried out last August, actually August of 2004 by now, which showed that about 50% of the people in New York City believed that top government officials had knowledge in advance of what was going to happen.
[00:40:13.064 --> 00:40:21.668]  Still, it's safe to say that most experts and most Americans place the blame for 9-11 only on Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda, not the U.S.
[00:40:21.708 --> 00:40:21.988]  government.
[00:40:22.549 --> 00:40:26.830]  Even she knows his comments may not go over well with many people.
[00:40:26.871 --> 00:40:33.974]  I'm sure I'm being demonized across the nation by, you know, all of the people that do that sort of thing.
[00:40:37.853 --> 00:40:38.633]  Hey, back at you.
[00:40:38.674 --> 00:40:39.014]  Thank you.
[00:40:39.074 --> 00:40:40.355]  You had some interesting comments.
[00:40:40.475 --> 00:40:43.038]  You were on a radio show and you talked about 9-11.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:49.305]  Is it a theory or you just don't believe the government account of what happened on 9-11?
[00:40:51.172 --> 00:40:51.933]  I just had questions.
[00:40:52.213 --> 00:40:53.235]  I had a lot of questions.
[00:40:54.416 --> 00:40:57.821]  The forum I chose to voice those questions in is the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[00:40:58.081 --> 00:41:01.525]  Just because he's a guy that I've been a fan of and followed for a lot of years.
[00:41:04.229 --> 00:41:04.910]  I got attacked.
[00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:05.891]  There were a lot of headpieces.
[00:41:05.951 --> 00:41:06.492]  The reaction was
[00:41:06.752 --> 00:41:09.094]  Yeah, people get very mad when celebrities have an opinion.
[00:41:09.114 --> 00:41:10.054]  I understand, I understand.
[00:41:10.094 --> 00:41:18.020]  I know he's not qualified, he doesn't, you know, he's just, who the hell is he to have an opinion about something so horrible?
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:27.087]  And, you know, it was sad because they didn't really take a look at any of the stuff I was asking them to look at, any of the evidence or any of the stuff that generated those questions, you know?
[00:41:27.627 --> 00:41:31.670]  And they said, oh, he's another tinfoil hat wearing Hollywood clown.
[00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:32.811]  It's like the only
[00:41:33.868 --> 00:41:42.234]  You know, I felt that the only real validation I needed was just being a taxpaying American that loves my country.
[00:41:42.774 --> 00:41:45.456]  And you, I mean, it's just something that you wonder about.
[00:41:46.733 --> 00:41:49.154]  And you would like to know more about it, I assume.
[00:41:49.234 --> 00:41:49.474]  Sure.
[00:41:49.494 --> 00:41:52.395]  And you studied the tapes and you... I've done a lot of research.
[00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:55.116]  And it's not just me, it's the people that have come before me.
[00:41:55.657 --> 00:42:02.359]  The experts and the engineers and the physicists and the scientists and the scholars that raised a lot of these things.
[00:42:02.399 --> 00:42:05.981]  And I took a look at their research and said, yeah, it doesn't add up.
[00:42:06.101 --> 00:42:07.101]  A lot of it doesn't add up.
[00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:08.982]  Hence these questions, you know.
[00:42:09.042 --> 00:42:10.303]  And there's two areas.
[00:42:10.323 --> 00:42:13.344]  There's Building 7 and there's the five frames from the Pentagon.
[00:42:13.604 --> 00:42:14.224]  Don't listen to me.
[00:42:14.484 --> 00:42:15.605]  Do your own research, you know.
[00:42:15.645 --> 00:42:16.205]  But I think that...
[00:42:16.646 --> 00:42:25.706]  You know, what happened to a time in this country when we were entitled, when we had a constitutional and a God-given right to be curious about things that didn't make sense?
[00:42:25.766 --> 00:42:26.368]  That's all it was.
[00:42:31.184 --> 00:42:37.687]  Alright folks, we are back live and I'm going to get into 20 minutes with the President.
[00:42:37.787 --> 00:42:44.990]  First I want to hit this Bank of the World open announcement into the dollar as the central banks actually try to drive the dollar down.
[00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.931]  Gold going up to $1,000 announced today.
[00:42:47.971 --> 00:42:50.552]  A lot of other important news and information.
[00:42:51.033 --> 00:42:51.693]  We are live.
[00:42:51.753 --> 00:42:52.853]  It is Tuesday, September 8, 2009.
[00:42:52.933 --> 00:42:58.756]  I'm Alex Jones and you can read 20 minutes with the President at InfoWars.com.
[00:43:00.942 --> 00:43:07.769]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:10.472]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[00:43:10.752 --> 00:43:15.216]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[00:43:15.397 --> 00:43:19.801]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:21.763]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[00:43:21.903 --> 00:43:22.403]  We're good to go.
[00:43:41.434 --> 00:43:41.654]  We're good.
[00:44:00.811 --> 00:44:08.396]  Robert Beatle's new book, Here's What You Do, was written for anyone who wants to survive the upcoming and ongoing financial storm.
[00:44:08.596 --> 00:44:13.478]  Get prepared and go to here'swhatyoudo.net and buy the $6 book.
[00:44:13.639 --> 00:44:19.182]  He is also trying to help us by running for Congress to stop the thievery and loss of liberties.
[00:44:19.462 --> 00:44:24.023]  Please arm yourself with his guide and go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:44:24.123 --> 00:44:26.124]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:44:26.304 --> 00:44:27.904]  Hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:44:28.124 --> 00:44:29.564]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:44:40.467 --> 00:44:40.847]  We're good to go.
[00:45:02.769 --> 00:45:07.712]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:45:07.752 --> 00:45:09.293]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:45:09.313 --> 00:45:10.954]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:45:11.034 --> 00:45:13.855]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:45:13.915 --> 00:45:17.837]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:32.154]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:45:33.356 --> 00:45:34.478]  An inside job.
[00:45:35.877 --> 00:45:36.918]  How dare you?
[00:45:37.358 --> 00:45:43.384]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:45:43.404 --> 00:45:45.705]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:45:45.746 --> 00:45:52.471]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:45:52.511 --> 00:45:55.334]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:45:55.594 --> 00:45:57.596]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:45:57.856 --> 00:46:00.338]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:46:13.985 --> 00:46:38.477]  Here's that New York Times article that came out over a year after we gave you the skinny on what was going on behind the scenes with the persecution of Charlie Sheen and then Mark Cuban by the Bush White House behind the scenes saying, sending him emails, calling him, the Securities and Exchange Commission saying, we're going to come after you, not even saying about what, we're going to investigate you if you don't not do this movie.
[00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:43.994]  You better not release loose change final cut or we're going to come after you.
[00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:56.586]  And then a year after they did that, they indicted him and he fought them and they had to drop it because he had the email and he swore in court to the phone call.
[00:46:58.257 --> 00:46:58.998]  The threatening phone call.
[00:46:59.038 --> 00:47:03.020]  That's the kind of stuff we go through to try to bring you this information.
[00:47:03.721 --> 00:47:10.566]  You know, if it's just stupid conspiracy theories, why would the White House talk about an enemies list, go after billionaires like Mark Cuban?
[00:47:11.907 --> 00:47:13.628]  Insider trading or political persecution?
[00:47:19.662 --> 00:47:22.204]  It goes through that article, and you can go read it for yourself.
[00:47:22.264 --> 00:47:32.131]  So, that's the type of bravery that Charlie Sheen has, knowing all this went on behind the scenes, and then it came out in the mainstream news, exactly as we had said it had happened, it did.
[00:47:33.211 --> 00:47:38.595]  Kind of like when I tell you the FBI's been here, but I'm under a gag order and can't talk about it, and later it comes out in the Associated Press.
[00:47:38.635 --> 00:47:38.935]  Why?
[00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:40.997]  This is the real world, folks.
[00:47:41.037 --> 00:47:42.538]  We're here at the front lines.
[00:47:42.898 --> 00:47:44.019]  We're dealing with killers here.
[00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.012]  We bring you this information.
[00:47:47.033 --> 00:47:56.044]  So I'm asking listeners to please go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and get 20 minutes with the President that Charlie Sheen and I spent so much time writing and putting together.
[00:47:56.765 --> 00:48:01.571]  And send it to the WhiteHouse.gov, send it to Glenn Beck, send it to all the talk show hosts, send it to everybody.
[00:48:02.452 --> 00:48:05.874]  And tell them that we want these answers responded to.
[00:48:05.934 --> 00:48:17.100]  Don't just call it conspiracy theories when 6 of the 10 9-11 Commission members are saying the official story was a lie and a fraud and that they wanted to have criminal prosecution of the Pentagon and the White House for covering up.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.962]  All those quotes are in the 20 minutes with the President piece that Charlie Sheen wrote.
[00:48:24.484 --> 00:48:26.725]  And then there's this story from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:48:28.171 --> 00:48:29.591]  This is important, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:29.631 --> 00:48:30.832]  This is extremely, extremely, extremely important.
[00:48:30.852 --> 00:48:32.612]  I don't have to stress enough how important it is.
[00:48:32.632 --> 00:48:35.453]  Now we're going to come back and I'm going to start the next hour and I'm going to read on air.
[00:48:35.473 --> 00:48:36.574]  It'll be grueling to read 16 pages.
[00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:00.359]  20 minutes with the President.
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:01.842]  So that is coming up.
[00:49:01.942 --> 00:49:08.055]  I did want to thank some of our sponsors today.
[00:49:10.228 --> 00:49:12.349]  And one of them is SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:49:12.389 --> 00:49:17.732]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food and feed your loved ones.
[00:49:18.312 --> 00:49:22.894]  If we have another Great Depression in this country, which we hope doesn't happen, it'll be essential to be able to feed yourself.
[00:49:22.914 --> 00:49:26.836]  Plus, it's just fun to have a garden and it's healthy to have non-GMO, non-hybrid seeds.
[00:49:26.876 --> 00:49:31.918]  And SurvivalSeedBank.com's got the best Survival Seed Bank out there we've seen, and it's a great price.
[00:49:32.258 --> 00:49:33.399]  SurvivalSeedBank.com, 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[00:49:37.921 --> 00:49:40.662]  It's not good enough just to own a bunch of firearms, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:40.682 --> 00:49:42.082]  You need to actually
[00:50:06.348 --> 00:50:07.610]  Know how to use the firearms.
[00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.094]  And this is no drill instructor or macho attitude.
[00:50:10.134 --> 00:50:11.176]  It's a family environment.
[00:50:11.937 --> 00:50:12.518]  Frontsight.com
[00:50:14.295 --> 00:50:17.757]  Act fast and they'll give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:50:18.078 --> 00:50:19.839]  FrontSight.com.
[00:50:20.419 --> 00:50:21.300]  FrontSight.com.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.102]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[00:50:24.122 --> 00:50:25.382]  Check out FrontSight.com today.
[00:50:25.643 --> 00:50:37.791]  And don't forget to support us so we can pay for this whole operation, to support the sponsors, and to go to InfoWars.com for the secure online video bookstore shopping cart to get films like Terror Storm, Endgame, and The Obama Deception.
[00:50:38.484 --> 00:50:38.945]  Stay with us.
[00:50:39.105 --> 00:50:41.029]  3rd Alex, straight ahead.
[00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:46.038]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:50:46.699 --> 00:50:49.904]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:50.834 --> 00:50:55.797]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:51:20.814 --> 00:51:21.394]  We're good.
[00:51:53.562 --> 00:51:55.484]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:55.964 --> 00:51:58.847]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:05.352 --> 00:52:06.012]  Big Brother.
[00:52:06.673 --> 00:52:07.714]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:08.434 --> 00:52:09.575]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:10.196 --> 00:52:11.017]  You want answers?
[00:52:11.777 --> 00:52:13.699]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:13.719 --> 00:52:17.082]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:17.522 --> 00:52:21.605]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:31.386]  Well, the headlines out there are that the United States faces an Argentina-style devaluation of the dollar.
[00:52:31.726 --> 00:52:45.379]  I hope that's not the case, but for years we've explained the bankers would implode their banking Ponzi scheme, then get tens of trillions more of the people in debt by saying they had to be bailed out, then using that money to loan it back to the governments.
[00:52:45.479 --> 00:52:45.759]  That's right.
[00:52:45.779 --> 00:52:49.623]  We give them our money, and then we pay them interest to get our own money back.
[00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.789]  And that's what's happened.
[00:52:52.029 --> 00:52:54.570]  $23.7 trillion, that number's almost two months old.
[00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.751]  It's over $2 trillion a month and counting, so that was a month and a half ago, it was $23.7.
[00:53:02.152 --> 00:53:05.493]  Close to $28 trillion, I predict, next time the number comes out.
[00:53:06.013 --> 00:53:09.894]  And back when it was $13 trillion, I was predicting it'd be $16 trillion, and it came out, it was $18 trillion.
[00:53:10.294 --> 00:53:15.616]  When it was $18 trillion and .7, I was predicting it'd be $22 trillion, and it was $23.7 trillion.
[00:53:15.636 --> 00:53:19.457]  So, it's probably, when it comes out, gonna be $28 trillion or more.
[00:53:20.469 --> 00:53:24.650]  Because every two months or so, the numbers come out, and we're set to get them again in the next few weeks.
[00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:34.252]  And then Obama, as things implode, are going to say, see, we've got to have an emergency reorganization, NORTHCOM's standing by, and don't riot in the streets because the flu's bad, and we've got to have you for quarantines.
[00:53:34.572 --> 00:53:36.733]  They've got all that in place in case they need it.
[00:53:37.913 --> 00:53:39.434]  And they could stage terror attacks.
[00:53:39.494 --> 00:53:42.955]  That's why Charlie Sheen's done 20 minutes with the President.
[00:53:44.975 --> 00:53:46.435]  As a way for the public to read it.
[00:53:46.835 --> 00:53:48.716]  And Charlie's saying, I want this meeting with the President.
[00:53:49.699 --> 00:53:51.020]  And here are the facts.
[00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:09.544]  Interview.
[00:54:09.744 --> 00:54:10.424]  Look at this article.
[00:54:10.464 --> 00:54:12.845]  Barack Obama accused of making depression mistakes.
[00:54:12.885 --> 00:54:13.425]  London Telegraph.
[00:54:13.686 --> 00:54:14.486]  They haven't made mistakes.
[00:54:14.526 --> 00:54:15.486]  This is all by design.
[00:54:15.506 --> 00:54:17.927]  They're getting ready to blame him like he's Herbert Hoover.
[00:54:18.167 --> 00:54:23.129]  And we say that in the Obama deception that he's being built up to God-like status to be destroyed.
[00:54:23.409 --> 00:54:26.270]  People laughed at me when that came out in March.
[00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:27.330]  What, five, six months ago?
[00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:28.050]  Six months ago.
[00:54:28.191 --> 00:54:29.291]  Now people aren't laughing.
[00:54:30.819 --> 00:54:33.900]  And think of the next messianic leader they're going to bring in, some phony right-winger.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.541]  And then, boy, the Republicans are going to think they've had a big victory.
[00:54:36.561 --> 00:54:39.382]  The Republican grassroots are going to think this person's the savior.
[00:54:39.622 --> 00:54:40.643]  And they're going to be even worse.
[00:54:41.083 --> 00:54:43.564]  And then even more evil Democrat will come after that.
[00:54:43.584 --> 00:54:45.344]  It's the same paradigm.
[00:54:45.684 --> 00:54:46.925]  The same program.
[00:54:50.066 --> 00:54:55.468]  In particular, the authors and economist Charles Rowley of George Mason University said it's
[00:54:57.085 --> 00:54:58.526]  It is also not impossible the U.S.
[00:54:58.546 --> 00:55:05.448]  will experience the kind of economic collapse at first, third world status experience by Argentina under the National Socialist government of Juan Perón.
[00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:06.049]  Perón.
[00:55:06.889 --> 00:55:09.630]  I mean that's the type of news and information we've got.
[00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:17.133]  We told you about this and oh don't fear monger, oh you know the banks can print and issue 23.7 trillion it's no problem.
[00:55:19.134 --> 00:55:22.415]  No, that money is now going out into the economy and it is devaluing it.
[00:55:22.916 --> 00:55:23.656]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:55:25.814 --> 00:55:29.258]  And the globalists are buying real assets with it before it's devalued.
[00:55:29.598 --> 00:55:32.702]  And then once it hits the street, see, so they get us coming and going.
[00:55:32.722 --> 00:55:38.589]  They get all our money, loan it back to us in interest, and then when it implodes the currency, they've already bought into real assets and commodities.
[00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:45.777]  And that's why, after Lindsey Williams' prediction in Bilderberg Group was the intel we had, they were going to lower it, then jack it back up.
[00:55:45.817 --> 00:55:46.438]  It's now happening.
[00:55:47.418 --> 00:55:48.740]  He said for at least a year it would be low.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.621]  Now that year is over.
[00:55:50.041 --> 00:55:51.062]  We see gold going up.
[00:55:51.102 --> 00:55:52.044]  We see oil going up.
[00:55:52.084 --> 00:55:53.585]  We see every major commodity going up.
[00:55:53.806 --> 00:56:00.814]  And then I see all over national news, they say, oh yes, it's not an oxymoron to have a growing economy and to be in a boom.
[00:56:00.854 --> 00:56:01.915]  We're going out of the recession.
[00:56:02.216 --> 00:56:06.240]  But to have fewer jobs and more people in soup lines and on unemployment.
[00:56:06.801 --> 00:56:08.282]  Yes, a jobless recovery.
[00:56:08.322 --> 00:56:12.425]  This is the type of crap that is fed to the American people and the people of the world.
[00:56:13.145 --> 00:56:22.211]  And so unless we bring the bankers to justice and abolish the Fed, nationalize it, unless we identify who the new world order are, a banking cabal, engage in a corporate takeover, it's over!
[00:56:24.112 --> 00:56:30.096]  So we've got to get real issues on the plate, and that's what this 20 minutes with the President does, and that's just the opening salvo.
[00:56:30.116 --> 00:56:30.496]  So again,
[00:56:32.383 --> 00:56:47.066]  I'm asking all of you to get 20 Minutes with the President and email it to your entire local media, newspapers, TV, radio, to hand out copies of it, to call the White House with it, to call Congress, to call Congressmen with it, to send it out to everybody.
[00:56:48.206 --> 00:56:48.526]  Okay?
[00:56:49.646 --> 00:56:54.307]  It is so vitally important and it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:56:54.607 --> 00:56:55.327]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:55.347 --> 00:56:59.028]  I'm going to read 20 Minutes with the President on air and then later, not yet, I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:57:01.189 --> 00:57:03.791]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:57:04.191 --> 00:57:09.154]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:57:09.535 --> 00:57:11.276]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:57:11.576 --> 00:57:16.379]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:57:16.579 --> 00:57:17.520]  How much do you want?
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.500]  When do you want it?
[00:57:18.881 --> 00:57:20.482]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:57:20.762 --> 00:57:21.582]  When will you need it?
[00:57:21.843 --> 00:57:23.904]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:57:24.044 --> 00:57:25.145]  Will there be any food?
[00:57:25.385 --> 00:57:26.686]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:57:26.906 --> 00:57:31.972]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:57:32.152 --> 00:57:35.356]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:57:35.756 --> 00:57:39.261]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:40.562]  How much will you need?
[00:57:40.802 --> 00:57:41.403]  We don't know.
[00:57:41.704 --> 00:57:42.625]  How much do you want?
[00:57:42.805 --> 00:57:43.526]  All you can get.
[00:57:43.546 --> 00:57:44.547]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:44.827 --> 00:57:47.591]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:57:47.871 --> 00:57:49.633]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:57:49.653 --> 00:57:50.554]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:04.233]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:04.494 --> 00:58:06.275]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:06.495 --> 00:58:14.783]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:58:15.023 --> 00:58:20.247]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:58:20.567 --> 00:58:22.189]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:58:22.429 --> 00:58:28.751]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:58:28.951 --> 00:58:39.693]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:58:39.993 --> 00:58:40.493]  That's right.
[00:58:40.754 --> 00:58:43.074]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:58:43.314 --> 00:58:44.895]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[00:58:46.855 --> 00:58:47.236]  That's 1-800-691-6043.

[00:59:03.115 --> 00:59:03.656]  Wow.
[00:59:04.176 --> 00:59:05.898]  All I can say is wow.
[00:59:06.398 --> 00:59:08.140]  Times are changing fast.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:09.661]  Scary needles.
[00:59:10.002 --> 00:59:11.983]  Laws changing until pretty soon.
[00:59:12.384 --> 00:59:14.786]  It'll be against the law to grow a tomato plant.
[00:59:15.026 --> 00:59:16.708]  How does this fit into health care?
[00:59:16.948 --> 00:59:17.689]  I'm not sure.
[00:59:17.949 --> 00:59:21.853]  But I am sure that Life Change T will give attention to your health.
[00:59:22.013 --> 00:59:22.593]  Good health.
[00:59:23.014 --> 00:59:25.136]  Join the many that have made the change.

[00:59:43.343 --> 00:59:44.483]  It doesn't come any easier.

[00:59:46.645 --> 00:59:50.307]  Oh yeah, and right now is our semi-annual special underway.
[00:59:50.667 --> 00:59:53.969]  It won't last long, so order now while you still can.

[01:00:02.172 --> 01:00:04.273]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:07.654]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.952 --> 01:00:24.356]  The globalists orchestrate the military crises, the terror crises, the economic crises, the health crises on record.
[01:00:24.376 --> 01:00:25.856]  They've been caught over and over again.
[01:00:25.876 --> 01:00:29.678]  And they bring it all to a head in a massive period of change.
[01:00:30.199 --> 01:00:33.981]  They're now going to try to set up the open bank of the world after they implode our economy and the dollar.
[01:00:34.321 --> 01:00:37.203]  They're now looking like they're going to go ahead and do it in the fall or winter.
[01:00:37.343 --> 01:00:38.824]  That's all over mainstream news today.
[01:00:39.904 --> 01:00:44.206]  It's all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com if you want to link through to it.
[01:00:45.727 --> 01:00:46.728]  And find it all in one spot.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.544]  They are moving on every front and we believe they're going to stage terror attacks unless we expose it.
[01:00:53.844 --> 01:00:57.507]  And that's the main reason Charlie Sheen has gone public with his 20 minutes with the President.
[01:00:57.867 --> 01:01:05.973]  Written as if he met with him so people will then go and read the article and see why Charlie wants to meet with him and the evidence he'd like to present.
[01:01:06.814 --> 01:01:10.457]  Because he does want to have a meeting with the President and he's asking other people to go public.
[01:01:12.038 --> 01:01:14.140]  And a lot more is coming up throughout the week.
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.822]  I'm going to read 20 minutes with the President.
[01:01:17.964 --> 01:01:21.210]  Coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:01:22.632 --> 01:01:31.267]  But before I do that, a lot of people have requested this, so I'm just going to air about 10 minutes of it, then I'm going to read 20 minutes of the President, then get into all the economic news and open the phones up.
[01:01:33.834 --> 01:01:39.157]  But I want to go ahead and just play a little bit of that first interview from April of 2006.
[01:01:40.637 --> 01:01:42.258]  We played one of the CNN clips earlier.
[01:01:42.678 --> 01:01:47.081]  Here is part of that interview from PrisonPlanet.TV with Charlie Sheen.
[01:01:47.481 --> 01:01:53.344]  They've got a lot of people emailing me saying this isn't even Charlie Sheen in the letter and that Charlie Sheen has never been on the show.
[01:01:53.384 --> 01:01:55.605]  There's a lot of disinfo going on out there.
[01:01:55.625 --> 01:01:59.407]  Yes, Charlie Sheen's been on the show, so has Willie Nelson, so has Jesse Ventura, all these other people.
[01:02:00.618 --> 01:02:01.938]  Yes, he's a 9-11 truther.
[01:02:02.398 --> 01:02:03.339]  Yes, this is huge.
[01:02:03.359 --> 01:02:05.719]  And I'm going to explain why it's huge after we air a few minutes of this.
[01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:06.519]  Here it is.
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:12.440]  He's been in over 65 major motion pictures.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:13.760]  Produced them, written them.
[01:02:15.061 --> 01:02:17.441]  From Platoon to Red Dawn, one of my favorites.
[01:02:19.221 --> 01:02:21.962]  And of course, TV shows like Spin City.
[01:02:22.222 --> 01:02:27.043]  Right now he's the major star on the CBS program Two and a Half Men.
[01:02:28.004 --> 01:02:32.208]  And he's got several new movies coming out this year and next year.
[01:02:33.169 --> 01:02:36.712]  And when I got a chance to talk to Charlie Sheen, I was just amazed.
[01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:39.074]  Because I've talked to a lot of other big Hollywood people.
[01:02:39.094 --> 01:02:40.295]  We've got a few of them on this show.
[01:02:41.176 --> 01:02:46.281]  And, you know, they call me up sometimes and say, hey, you're doing a great job, or I'm buying 50 copies of your video.
[01:02:46.361 --> 01:02:47.562]  And I'm like, no, here, just take it.
[01:02:47.582 --> 01:02:51.966]  But they're not as informed, I have to be honest, as Charlie Sheen.
[01:02:52.006 --> 01:02:54.408]  I mean, I talked to this guy like an hour and a half yesterday, and he just
[01:02:55.233 --> 01:02:55.574]  I think so.
[01:03:11.036 --> 01:03:11.817]  Nice to be here, Alex.
[01:03:11.857 --> 01:03:12.157]  How are you?
[01:03:40.139 --> 01:03:40.600]  I'm great.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:04:01.293]  Mr. Sheen, you have some questions about the official 9-11 story, and we got hooked up because we both mutually have been looking into that, and I want to just, I guess, start by what happened on 9-11, what your instincts told you, and really just go from there.
[01:04:01.313 --> 01:04:06.857]  Well, it was interesting, and let me just preface that by saying that
[01:04:08.302 --> 01:04:34.345]  I've been a fan of yours for a long time and I've been following you and I've seen all of your documentaries and your research is tireless and it's interesting because a lot of these guys, you sort of look behind the notes and you start to discover inconsistencies in a lot of the claims that they're making, which pretty much torpedoes the credibility of most of their substance.
[01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:37.751]  With you, that's not the case.
[01:04:38.132 --> 01:04:44.235]  And I was always amazed to see that you always had hard data to back up your claims.
[01:04:44.575 --> 01:04:53.881]  And so, you know, this is tough for me because for the longest time I've been doing my own independent research and
[01:04:55.211 --> 01:05:13.882]  You know, I don't claim to be an expert in any of these fields, but just as a concerned, upstanding, tax-paying American citizen, there's just... There's questions I have that I wish somebody could explain away for me.
[01:05:14.522 --> 01:05:22.707]  There's things that one will view, and then look at the Keene Commission's official report, and it just...
[01:05:24.096 --> 01:05:30.464]  As I heard somebody once say, might have been you, there's holes in the story you could fly a Boeing jet through.
[01:05:30.484 --> 01:05:32.326]  Oh, there certainly is.
[01:05:32.386 --> 01:05:38.874]  In fact, we were talking yesterday and you said over the phone that the biggest conspiracy theory is the official story.
[01:05:38.914 --> 01:05:43.099]  I mean, at every point it's a fabrication, it's a lie.
[01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.040]  Would you elaborate on that?
[01:05:44.955 --> 01:06:04.200]  Well, yeah, it's like they want to just pigeonhole all of us into this group of conspiracy nutbags when we're not really debating things that are related to UFOs bringing down the towers, or Building 7, or the Pentagon, right?
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:12.943]  And so, it just, you know, it just feels like, you know,
[01:06:14.133 --> 01:06:19.917]  Things in there that we're not the conspiracy theorists on this particular issue.
[01:06:20.457 --> 01:06:21.758]  It seems to me like...
[01:06:23.914 --> 01:06:30.777]  You know, 19 amateurs with box cutters taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75% of their targets.
[01:06:31.657 --> 01:06:33.298]  That feels like a conspiracy theory.
[01:06:33.538 --> 01:06:38.420]  Well, I tell you, back in 2001, everybody admits that cell phones didn't work over 3,000 feet.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.421]  How were they working at 33,000, 32,000 feet?
[01:06:40.681 --> 01:06:44.142]  How did Al-Qaeda make NORAD stand down?
[01:06:44.162 --> 01:06:49.844]  Did Al-Qaeda call Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, as the Chronicle reported, and say, don't fly to New York?
[01:06:49.904 --> 01:06:50.945]  No, the White House did.
[01:06:51.785 --> 01:06:53.726]  Yeah, the answer to that would be probably not.
[01:07:18.433 --> 01:07:29.078]  No, it's just the more you look at stuff, especially specific incidents, specific events around the fateful day, it just...
[01:07:31.405 --> 01:07:32.846]  It just raises a lot of questions.
[01:07:33.207 --> 01:07:42.334]  There's a lot of questions, and I know that a couple of years ago, it was severely unpopular to discuss any of this.
[01:07:43.876 --> 01:07:53.724]  But it sort of feels like, just in my research and in the people that I talk to and in and around my circles, it seems like the worm is turning.
[01:07:53.744 --> 01:07:57.027]  Because you start talking about this, even with
[01:07:58.355 --> 01:08:09.120]  Conservative Republicans, and they can't really debate away some of the most obvious facts on that day.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.501]  Let me ask my radio producer a question.
[01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:13.922]  Did you find that clip of Dan Rather?
[01:08:15.283 --> 01:08:22.186]  Let me just roll this little 30-second clip, because this is what Dan Rather thought about 20 seconds after Building 7 collapsed.
[01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:25.528]  They backed the tape up and played it, and this is what he said live.
[01:08:25.548 --> 01:08:26.148]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:08:26.787 --> 01:08:29.309]  And again, what you're seeing are high shots.
[01:08:30.809 --> 01:08:33.911]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[01:08:34.311 --> 01:08:36.873]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[01:08:37.874 --> 01:08:38.474]  It's amazing.
[01:08:39.735 --> 01:08:41.776]  Amazing, incredible, if you were.
[01:08:42.768 --> 01:08:54.254]  For the third time today, in reminiscence of those pictures we've all seen too much of television before, a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[01:08:54.714 --> 01:09:03.719]  Alright, so there's Dan Rather, and that's what I thought that morning, that's what engineers, the heads of engineering colleges, that's what a lot of people said.
[01:09:04.619 --> 01:09:06.040]  Charlie, what did you think on that morning?
[01:09:07.881 --> 01:09:10.742]  Well, where do we start?
[01:09:13.251 --> 01:09:19.592]  I was up early, actually, and we were going to do a pre-shoot on Spin City, the show I used to do.
[01:09:21.172 --> 01:09:28.894]  And so, gosh, I was up, and I was watching the news, and the North Tower was burning.
[01:09:29.834 --> 01:09:37.275]  And so, you know, the world was focused on what I guess they were assuming to be pilot error, right?
[01:09:37.315 --> 01:09:39.976]  Or some tragedy nobody could really explain.
[01:09:41.036 --> 01:09:44.217]  And so I saw the South Tower hit live.
[01:09:45.517 --> 01:09:50.039]  That famous wide shot where it disappears behind the building, and then we see the tremendous fireball, you know?
[01:09:51.099 --> 01:09:59.861]  And there was just a feeling that it just didn't look... How do I say this?
[01:10:00.141 --> 01:10:06.883]  It didn't look like any commercial jetliner I've flown on any time in my life.
[01:10:07.223 --> 01:10:09.444]  And then when the buildings came down,
[01:10:10.894 --> 01:10:25.466]  Later on that day, I was at my parents' house, and we were out on the deck, and I said, hey, call me insane, but did it sort of look like those buildings came down in a controlled demolition?
[01:10:25.486 --> 01:10:32.532]  And he said, well, kind of, but gosh, that's impossible if you think about what it would take for them to orchestrate that.
[01:10:35.882 --> 01:10:40.645]  As the days and the weeks went on, I was sort of told what to believe.
[01:10:40.985 --> 01:10:46.669]  And I was told through mainstream media and all of the talking heads about what really happened.
[01:10:46.889 --> 01:10:57.315]  Now, Charlie, when the press hears your interview, if they think it's radical that you thought it looked like explosives, they better go talk to Dan Rather than the host of CBS Nightly News.
[01:10:57.395 --> 01:11:01.157]  And we also have a clip of Peter Jennings saying the exact same thing twice.
[01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:08.966]  So he says it looks like bombs, so I guess they'll have to dig up poor Peter Jennings and gripe at him for thinking the same thing that you and I thought.
[01:11:09.446 --> 01:11:15.853]  Of course, but what bothers me even more about all of this is that all of this stuff exists from day one.
[01:11:16.554 --> 01:11:27.843]  If you start looking at all of the news reporting after day one, the official story starts to find its way into our consciousness.
[01:11:27.943 --> 01:11:29.984]  They start telling us the conspiracy theory.
[01:11:30.024 --> 01:11:33.647]  The conspiracy theorists in the government start telling us their wild-eyed conspiracies.
[01:11:34.408 --> 01:11:34.868]  Exactly.
[01:11:35.569 --> 01:11:40.292]  And so we all go away from what we felt in our gut initially.
[01:11:40.672 --> 01:11:41.953]  Charlie Sheen, stay right there.
[01:11:41.993 --> 01:11:42.674]  We've got a break.
[01:11:42.694 --> 01:11:43.555]  We'll be right back.
[01:11:43.995 --> 01:11:45.056]  Folks, strap yourselves in.
[01:11:47.659 --> 01:11:54.033]  Alright folks, do strap yourselves in, because we are going to break.
[01:11:54.835 --> 01:11:56.558]  Stay with us, we'll come back and read in full.
[01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:58.462]  20 Minutes with the President, by Charlie Sheen.

[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.942]  A new world order.
[01:13:05.663 --> 01:13:10.046]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:13:10.547 --> 01:13:13.369]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.651]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:13:16.172 --> 01:13:18.574]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:13:19.341 --> 01:13:26.648]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:13:29.673 --> 01:13:34.636]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[01:13:42.722 --> 01:13:43.502]  They're not after money.
[01:13:43.522 --> 01:13:44.603]  They have all the money they need.
[01:13:44.803 --> 01:13:45.384]  They're after power.
[01:13:45.404 --> 01:13:46.644]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:16:17.117 --> 01:16:23.781]  Looking at 20 Minutes with the President, I realize it's 16 pages.
[01:16:23.801 --> 01:16:25.362]  I'm going to read some key areas of it.
[01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:32.346]  And I'm going to go ahead specifically for the listeners.
[01:16:33.587 --> 01:16:35.669]  And I'm going to open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:35.749]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:16:35.809 --> 01:16:42.334]  I want to ask you, are you going to stand with 9-11 Truth, with Charlie Sheen, with myself, who boldly is going public, asking the President to have a meeting with him?
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:17:02.651]  And Charlie wrote up a mock interview to publish the facts and the information of what he wants to discuss and to put into the interview two folders he gives the president that have all the evidence.
[01:17:02.731 --> 01:17:07.055]  That's the way we get the public to actually read it when they ignored the regular document pages.
[01:17:08.254 --> 01:17:11.596]  And then Charlie explains, this meeting hasn't happened yet, but I would like it to.
[01:17:11.976 --> 01:17:15.919]  And he's officially asking Obama to meet with him when he's out on the trail.
[01:17:16.499 --> 01:17:17.800]  Or Charlie will fly to meet with him.
[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:20.781]  Or when the President's out doing things.
[01:17:22.502 --> 01:17:25.384]  And by the way, Sheen's hung out with Clinton, hung out with Gore.
[01:17:25.864 --> 01:17:27.886]  Been on plane trips with him, you know, way back in the day.
[01:17:28.386 --> 01:17:29.827]  His dad knows all these people.
[01:17:32.168 --> 01:17:36.351]  Later in the week, I might let you, well, we might talk a little bit about Martin Sheen.
[01:17:37.631 --> 01:17:39.232]  If he's anywhere involved in all of this.
[01:17:39.313 --> 01:17:43.096]  But the point is, is that this is not an impossible meeting.
[01:17:43.136 --> 01:17:53.264]  But regardless, it's about a national debate about are we going to let six of the ten members of the Commission come out and say the whole investigation of 9-11 is a fraud and then ignore that?
[01:17:54.245 --> 01:17:56.247]  You know, that's the big question here.
[01:17:57.768 --> 01:18:04.134]  And so Charlie put it in this format about meeting with the President to put out his information to then say
[01:18:05.626 --> 01:18:07.328]  I want to meet with the President.
[01:18:08.289 --> 01:18:09.530]  That's the whole point of this.
[01:18:10.651 --> 01:18:12.012]  But that's only a small part.
[01:18:12.753 --> 01:18:21.081]  But the whole point of the letter being written that way, it's about getting everybody active, everybody in the town halls, we are change going to events, asking them if they're going to
[01:18:22.358 --> 01:18:33.485]  Respond in 20 minutes with the President, if he's going to meet with Charlie Sheen, if they're going to talk about all the Commission members, 6 of the 10 saying it was a fraud, members of their counsel, their lawyers saying it was a fraud, saying it was a criminal cover-up.
[01:18:34.126 --> 01:18:36.407]  We cannot just stand idly by and let this continue.
[01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:43.812]  And again, a 20-plus minute interview with Charlie Sheen tomorrow, Charlie Sheen live, on air, coming up.
[01:18:44.902 --> 01:18:46.483]  Uh, videotaped interview I did as well.
[01:18:46.503 --> 01:18:48.905]  The next three days, Charlie Sheen, all three days.
[01:18:49.506 --> 01:18:50.867]  Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[01:18:50.887 --> 01:18:54.350]  I already played a short clip of one of the recorded interviews I did with him.
[01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:57.292]  Just so we, you know, have that in the can.
[01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:57.972]  We've got that.
[01:18:58.413 --> 01:19:00.254]  But he's gonna be live with us as well.
[01:19:00.414 --> 01:19:01.195]  And video!
[01:19:02.116 --> 01:19:02.456]  Because...
[01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:07.833]  Charlie knows the power of video actually seeing him talk about all this.
[01:19:08.674 --> 01:19:15.261]  I'm already getting the emails and calls saying the clip we just played isn't Charlie Sheen and that I never had Charlie Sheen on the air.
[01:19:15.301 --> 01:19:18.024]  This is the type of disinfo and the establishment does this.
[01:19:18.064 --> 01:19:24.131]  It's just like they'll deny there's a Bank of the World that's been set up or a plan to have a global carbon tax as all these governments pass them.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.001]  It's a military tactic to deny, deny, deny.
[01:19:28.981 --> 01:19:31.502]  So, no need to even respond to all that.
[01:19:31.822 --> 01:19:33.962]  Let's play that clip of Charlie Sheen, the new clip.
[01:19:34.682 --> 01:19:36.603]  Again, let's play that clip right now.
[01:19:36.963 --> 01:19:40.504]  The clip of Sheen, just a minute and a half of this 20-plus minute interview I've got.
[01:19:40.524 --> 01:19:41.804]  We're going to air in its entirety tomorrow.
[01:19:42.185 --> 01:19:43.385]  And then Sheen coming up live.
[01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:44.025]  Here it is.
[01:19:44.805 --> 01:19:46.046]  Charlie, it's great to be here with you.
[01:19:46.406 --> 01:19:48.046]  Appreciate you doing this interview.
[01:19:48.206 --> 01:19:48.826]  Likewise, Alex.
[01:19:48.866 --> 01:19:49.166]  Thank you.
[01:19:49.587 --> 01:19:55.088]  Why, after three years of silence concerning 9-11, are you now speaking up, and why have
[01:20:00.034 --> 01:20:04.838]  Well, Alex, I wrote this letter for two reasons.
[01:20:05.619 --> 01:20:11.383]  Firstly, I wanted to create a public document specifically rooted in fact.
[01:20:12.164 --> 01:20:19.590]  If anybody dares question that, I would encourage those people to scrutinize it, to research it.
[01:20:21.343 --> 01:20:24.264]  The truth is unchanging, Alex, as we both know.
[01:20:25.044 --> 01:20:29.905]  The only aspect of this piece that had to be manufactured were the President's words.
[01:20:30.506 --> 01:20:36.147]  Everything else will withstand the critical assault I'm more than prepared to endure.
[01:20:36.167 --> 01:20:44.930]  And secondly, this is our first new President since 9-11, and consequently his first 9-11 anniversary in office.
[01:20:46.983 --> 01:20:48.024]  Enough stonewalling.
[01:20:48.084 --> 01:20:50.347]  Enough media manipulation.
[01:20:50.367 --> 01:20:53.050]  Enough media mantra speak.
[01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:55.573]  The families deserve better, Alex.
[01:20:55.653 --> 01:20:57.535]  America deserves better.
[01:20:57.555 --> 01:20:58.316]  I mean, come on.
[01:20:58.916 --> 01:20:59.717]  Come on, people.
[01:20:59.737 --> 01:21:04.683]  The 9-11 Commission report is a blatant work of manipulation, secrecy, and fiction.
[01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:07.390]  Come on, the time is now.
[01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:09.051]  Demand the truth.
[01:21:09.851 --> 01:21:18.276]  I personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like a new investigation is just going to fall out of the heavens right into our Congress.
[01:21:18.697 --> 01:21:19.897]  We have to take action.
[01:21:20.237 --> 01:21:21.198]  We have to stand as one.
[01:21:21.218 --> 01:21:24.420]  We must insist that our new president deliver on his promises.
[01:21:26.221 --> 01:21:27.982]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to break.
[01:21:29.722 --> 01:21:37.306]  And you know what, I'll go ahead and take some phone calls, and I'll read some passages, because I was thinking about reading the whole thing, and maybe I will the last 30 minutes, because it takes about 25 minutes to read it.
[01:21:37.966 --> 01:21:41.228]  If you don't read super fast, it's really like 25 minutes with the President.
[01:21:41.268 --> 01:21:43.289]  We wanted to add so much documentation in here.
[01:21:44.050 --> 01:21:49.032]  But that is all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, and a bunch of financial news.
[01:21:49.052 --> 01:21:50.233]  Stay with us.
[01:21:51.313 --> 01:21:52.194]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.694 --> 01:21:54.295]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:55.235 --> 01:21:57.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.635 --> 01:22:05.822]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:22:05.962 --> 01:22:10.328]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:22:10.488 --> 01:22:12.331]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:22:12.771 --> 01:22:14.113]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:22:14.393 --> 01:22:15.415]  There is a solution.
[01:22:15.655 --> 01:22:23.658]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:22:37.584 --> 01:22:43.147]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:05.893]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.570]  We're good.
[01:24:01.326 --> 01:24:06.791]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:24:07.051 --> 01:24:08.352]  And we knew what to do.
[01:24:08.372 --> 01:24:10.154]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:24:10.374 --> 01:24:16.799]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:25.927]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:33.100]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:36.463]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:24:36.563 --> 01:24:41.788]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:24:42.349 --> 01:24:44.971]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:24:45.432 --> 01:24:52.358]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:24:54.738 --> 01:25:02.985]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have to launch an offensive against the fraud, the lie, the hoax that the official 9-11 fable is.
[01:25:15.273 --> 01:25:25.083]  I keep repeating this, six of the ten commission members and two of the five council said it was a fraud, a lie, a criminal cover-up, there should be a criminal investigation, not just a new investigation.
[01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:32.071]  Obama's expanding the wars, the wiretapping, the torture, the secret police, and I'm sick of it, and so is Charlie Sheen, and I know you are.
[01:25:33.001 --> 01:25:38.204]  And so Charlie Sheen's going public, a bunch of other public people went public in the year or so after he went public.
[01:25:38.604 --> 01:25:39.885]  It energized 9-11 Truth.
[01:25:39.905 --> 01:25:42.647]  9-11 Truth just kept on chugging after Obama got in.
[01:25:43.067 --> 01:25:54.314]  But the establishment, as I predicted, I know their mind, came back in after Bush was gone, believing that now it was depoliticized and they could kind of rewrite history and attack 9-11 Truth.
[01:25:54.334 --> 01:25:56.696]  They're doing it with all these new TV shows coming out.
[01:25:56.756 --> 01:25:59.758]  A couple of them have already aired this year, more airing in the next month.
[01:26:00.538 --> 01:26:02.838]  They are trying to attack us, but more and more evidence.
[01:26:02.878 --> 01:26:06.599]  Sybil Edmonds, the FBI translator, comes out, breaks her federal gag order.
[01:26:06.639 --> 01:26:08.080]  That's in his 20 minutes to the President.
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:14.481]  And says that the CIA was running Al Qaeda and Taliban right up until the day of 9-11.
[01:26:14.801 --> 01:26:16.741]  That is huge bombshell news.
[01:26:16.801 --> 01:26:18.342]  She told the 9-11 Commission that.
[01:26:18.642 --> 01:26:19.642]  And they wanted to go public.
[01:26:19.662 --> 01:26:20.622]  We're told to shut up!
[01:26:21.082 --> 01:26:22.842]  That's why they came out and said it was a fraud!
[01:26:23.183 --> 01:26:24.783]  You realize how hardcore this is?
[01:26:25.731 --> 01:26:27.172]  You realize how serious this is?
[01:26:27.212 --> 01:26:28.213]  You realize how real this is?
[01:26:28.233 --> 01:26:37.000]  You know, I also want to ask the listeners, what are your ideas to get 20 minutes with the President out and his, the article titled, Charlie Sheen requests meeting with Obama over 9-1-1 cover-up.
[01:26:37.261 --> 01:26:40.624]  That's the whole point of him going public with a meeting with the President.
[01:26:41.484 --> 01:26:43.006]  With a fiction meeting he wrote up.
[01:26:43.906 --> 01:26:48.050]  Saying, I want to have a real meeting and I want to present him with this evidence and this bibliography.
[01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:52.932]  Please, ladies and gentlemen, I launched 9-11 Truth.
[01:26:52.952 --> 01:26:55.915]  The day of the attacks, I went on air and I said, we've got to expose this fraud.
[01:26:56.496 --> 01:27:00.760]  And all these other people that later became prominent 9-11 folks got mad at me, attacked me, I remember.
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:02.882]  But it's my job to hit the barbed wire.
[01:27:03.742 --> 01:27:05.264]  We talked about it two months before it happened.
[01:27:05.624 --> 01:27:09.207]  But when the event took place, we came out, we exposed it.
[01:27:10.288 --> 01:27:10.849]  I took the heat.
[01:27:12.958 --> 01:27:15.460]  I lost about 70% of the radio stations I was on at the time.
[01:27:16.221 --> 01:27:19.803]  That was kind of the end of the Bill Clinton days and I just started to bash Bush.
[01:27:21.585 --> 01:27:23.726]  Before I was depoliticizing and just saying he was a puppet.
[01:27:23.847 --> 01:27:27.970]  A lot of people say, oh I'd stand up, oh I'd tell the truth.
[01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:32.513]  Well, I'm somebody that did and lost 7 out of 10 stations I was on.
[01:27:32.573 --> 01:27:37.337]  Over the years I built back up more stations and got bigger than I even was at the time.
[01:27:39.002 --> 01:27:42.704]  I've taken a lot of hits for this, because the truth's all that matters.
[01:27:44.906 --> 01:27:51.589]  Charlie Sheen's somebody who gets $500,000 an episode, and two or three times that on syndication.
[01:27:52.170 --> 01:27:55.192]  With all these seven, eight years of his show, what is it, in the eighth year now?
[01:27:55.732 --> 01:27:56.332]  Re-airing everywhere.
[01:27:56.372 --> 01:27:58.213]  He's got a lot at stake here.
[01:27:58.253 --> 01:27:59.234]  He's got a lot of courage.
[01:27:59.254 --> 01:28:05.758]  And we've got to stand with him in what he's done against the COINTELPRO, against the Disinfo, against the Spins, against everybody.
[01:28:07.172 --> 01:28:08.754]  And I want to put a challenge out to people.
[01:28:08.914 --> 01:28:23.306]  Even if you don't like me personally, for whatever slights over the years or people in our community, at least stand behind Charlie Sheen and 9-11 Truth and realize how important this is to everybody because we have no future if we don't turn the corner on this.
[01:28:23.847 --> 01:28:26.909]  Now I want to go to Donna, Mike, Chris, John and others.
[01:28:26.949 --> 01:28:28.331]  Toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:28.351 --> 01:28:30.492]  What are your ideas of ways to get 9-11 Truth out?
[01:28:34.716 --> 01:28:41.320]  What are your ideas of making it a big political issue and making it an issue?
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:54.447]  We have that power now to go into the town halls, to go into the city councils, to go into talk radio, to call in, to make websites, and this is the best 16 pages of material I've seen with the 20 bullet points in here.
[01:28:54.487 --> 01:28:55.348]  In fact, let me just read the 20.
[01:28:55.428 --> 01:28:58.090]  Well, you know what?
[01:28:58.130 --> 01:29:01.251]  I'll read the 20 bullet points after I take some calls and cover some economic news.
[01:29:01.271 --> 01:29:03.533]  We'll do this at 8 after the start of the next hour.
[01:29:04.949 --> 01:29:07.232]  I kind of... I'm not a news reader.
[01:29:07.252 --> 01:29:08.735]  I don't like reading long things on air.
[01:29:08.755 --> 01:29:12.320]  I'm kind of looking at it like a big garage I've got to clean out or something.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:14.303]  You know, your garage, it's full of junk over five years.
[01:29:14.343 --> 01:29:16.185]  I'm like, I'll have to read this on air.
[01:29:16.546 --> 01:29:18.248]  But I'm going to cover it because it's key info.
[01:29:20.046 --> 01:29:21.226]  The point is I can half-ass read it.
[01:29:21.246 --> 01:29:24.507]  I want to focus and read it good, which I'm capable of, but it takes a lot of energy for me to do that.
[01:29:24.547 --> 01:29:25.687]  So, that's coming up.
[01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:28.828]  Let's go ahead and talk to John Disagrees.
[01:29:29.308 --> 01:29:32.989]  So I'll go to the head of the line with him, but I'm going to try to be quick with the caller.
[01:29:33.009 --> 01:29:33.810]  So have your point ready.
[01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:36.570]  John, I don't know what you're calling about, but you disagree about something.
[01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:36.950]  Go ahead.
[01:29:37.911 --> 01:29:46.753]  Yes, you know, I've always agreed, and you know that I do, that you've been on the cutting edge of exposing the 9-11 inside job, and I totally support Charlie Sheen.
[01:29:47.432 --> 01:29:51.054]  But I really can't recommend your program anymore.
[01:29:51.094 --> 01:29:57.036]  I try to find others who bring up the same things you do, but like globalresearch.ca.
[01:29:57.136 --> 01:29:59.437]  Yeah, yeah, listen, listen, listen.
[01:30:00.157 --> 01:30:01.118]  I link to their stories.
[01:30:02.335 --> 01:30:07.159]  We have them on, they're nice folks, but I'm not going to have you come on and say I'm a piece of crap and then recommend a bunch of other stuff.
[01:30:07.999 --> 01:30:16.066]  I understand, you've called before, you're a communist, and you don't like it that I bad-mouth Van Jones who, quote, wants a total redistribution of wealth.
[01:30:16.626 --> 01:30:18.568]  That means absolute death pits.
[01:30:18.608 --> 01:30:22.791]  That means absolute commissars in black uniforms and people in work brigades.
[01:30:23.572 --> 01:30:25.533]  And let me guess, that's what you're upset about?
[01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:27.515]  It's not what I'm upset about.
[01:30:27.535 --> 01:30:28.736]  Well say it then!
[01:30:29.455 --> 01:30:56.290]  I'm upset about the fact that you're joining with the neocons, and many of the guests you have on, you're joining with those who are opposing the world order, the IMF, the kinds of things that John Perkins is talking about, the people who are even on your side and exposing the inside job of 9-11, like another person who is on the COINTELPRO list even more than you are, Chavez of Venezuela, who has been attacked by the military-industrial CIA complex,
[01:30:57.089 --> 01:31:00.752]  Kidnapped, almost assassinated until millions of people rose up.
[01:31:01.092 --> 01:31:04.915]  So I'm just saying that you've got your feet in two camps.
[01:31:05.035 --> 01:31:06.336]  I appreciate your call.
[01:31:06.736 --> 01:31:16.664]  Yeah, this show isn't like a religious cult where everything is circumscript and, you know, I wash my hands this way and I chant everything just right.
[01:31:17.945 --> 01:31:21.828]  I have John Perkins on who I agree with a lot, but I disagree with him a lot.
[01:31:21.868 --> 01:31:23.209]  I tell him on air I disagree with him.
[01:31:24.201 --> 01:31:29.865]  And I have people like Jerome Corsi on, Dr. Corsi, and I agree with him on some things, and I argue with him on others.
[01:31:29.925 --> 01:31:31.446]  It's a four-hour radio show.
[01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:35.929]  I mean, I link to mainstream news all the time that I disagree with.
[01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:45.056]  From the phony left, the phony right, all points in between, and people always comment under the link, oh look, he's got a Republican link, he's got a Democrat link.
[01:31:45.796 --> 01:31:47.878]  Oh look, he's linked to Chavez's speech.
[01:31:48.737 --> 01:31:49.418]  He's a communist.
[01:31:49.758 --> 01:31:51.501]  He's linked to something Glenn Beck said.
[01:31:51.541 --> 01:31:52.522]  He supports Glenn Beck.
[01:31:52.862 --> 01:31:54.024]  And it's all straw man!
[01:31:54.885 --> 01:31:55.245]  Okay?
[01:31:55.626 --> 01:31:56.747]  I put out my info.
[01:31:57.088 --> 01:31:59.171]  You do what you want with it, John.
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:01.100]  Okay?
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:02.701]  I mean, it's crazy!
[01:32:03.321 --> 01:32:04.742]  We're not left, we're not right.
[01:32:04.942 --> 01:32:08.623]  We're for decentralization, we're for true liberty, we're for freedom.
[01:32:09.104 --> 01:32:18.448]  And I supported Chavez early on, defeating the North American Union's expansion into the South American, Central American free trade area, the Americas.
[01:32:19.248 --> 01:32:20.749]  But now he is arresting people.
[01:32:20.809 --> 01:32:22.029]  He is shutting down media.
[01:32:24.383 --> 01:32:26.845]  You see, it's so childlike, John.
[01:32:27.606 --> 01:32:29.808]  I think the globalists running our country are bad.
[01:32:30.648 --> 01:32:33.070]  And then I think the socialists and communists are bad.
[01:32:33.171 --> 01:32:35.292]  I think government, big government's always bad.
[01:32:35.633 --> 01:32:36.674]  History shows that.
[01:32:37.294 --> 01:32:38.975]  Liberty and freedom is incredibly rare.
[01:32:39.296 --> 01:32:41.337]  Tyranny is incredibly popular.
[01:32:42.138 --> 01:32:49.725]  And I was talking about Oliver Stone coming out and making a worship fest about Hugo Chavez.
[01:32:51.479 --> 01:32:58.423]  But then, and I oppose the coup against Chavez, he's democratically elected, though he's trying to stand for life now, he's turning into Fidel Castro.
[01:32:58.443 --> 01:32:59.524]  I don't support Fidel Castro.
[01:33:00.024 --> 01:33:01.985]  Does that mean I support the right-wingers that are against him?
[01:33:02.065 --> 01:33:02.465]  No!
[01:33:03.746 --> 01:33:12.211]  See, I don't put these people up on pedestals, and so if I say I agree with them on this but not on that, I think Fidel Castro is going in a bad direction, that's what I'm saying!
[01:33:12.511 --> 01:33:14.452]  I'm not in your left-right system!
[01:33:15.353 --> 01:33:20.636]  Now, I use the term left-right sometimes just to communicate, because we're on all these AM and FM stations across the country.
[01:33:21.815 --> 01:33:23.598]  And people tuning in, you know, here's an example.
[01:33:23.819 --> 01:33:27.084]  Every time I talk about pirate radio, I get
[01:33:28.197 --> 01:33:30.759]  Scores of emails and calls going, you bastard, son of a bitch.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.261]  You are calling it pirate.
[01:33:33.301 --> 01:33:34.042]  It's not pirate.
[01:33:34.082 --> 01:33:37.324]  We under the First Amendment should be allowed to have micro-FMs if we're not interfering.
[01:33:37.625 --> 01:33:41.208]  Yes, I pioneered back in the late 90s saying put them up nationwide.
[01:33:41.568 --> 01:33:42.308]  I support them.
[01:33:42.589 --> 01:33:49.594]  But when you get up and call them micros, 95% of people don't know what you're talking about.
[01:33:49.855 --> 01:33:54.779]  It's like if you're in Russia talking to Russian speakers, you don't speak Chinese to them.
[01:33:55.759 --> 01:33:56.880]  Or Japanese or English.
[01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:57.581]  You speak Russian.
[01:33:59.249 --> 01:34:04.572]  So all this straw man, mental illness, compartmentalization, it really gets to me.
[01:34:04.612 --> 01:34:10.016]  It's like I say, if you're going to get involved in militias, look out, the feds are in there historically trying to provocateur you.
[01:34:10.316 --> 01:34:13.218]  I'm warning people, I'm saying we're all in the militia, 18 to 45.
[01:34:14.138 --> 01:34:15.679]  It's good, I support it.
[01:34:16.159 --> 01:34:18.481]  I broke the MIAC report, the DHS.
[01:34:19.281 --> 01:34:24.705]  I get these guys sending me threatening emails, you son of a, you know what, son of a donkey, you don't.
[01:34:25.703 --> 01:34:33.571]  You don't support the militias because I don't support people calling themselves the President of the Republic of Texas standing out front their trailer.
[01:34:34.512 --> 01:34:36.194]  And I'm not bashing somebody in a trailer.
[01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:40.898]  The point is, is that, I don't know, it doesn't mean I'm perfect either.
[01:34:40.958 --> 01:34:46.164]  It's just I'm sick of everybody saying what I am or misrepresenting what we are or what we do.
[01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:50.204]  And I guess just people getting these ruts and they can't get out of them.
[01:34:50.224 --> 01:34:51.705]  But yeah, I don't like communists, buddy.
[01:34:52.165 --> 01:34:54.647]  And I happen to know that the bankers funded it on record.
[01:34:54.707 --> 01:34:55.908]  You called in and denied that.
[01:34:56.668 --> 01:35:01.952]  I happen to know there's a lot of big banks in Central and South America manipulating a fake leftist revolution.
[01:35:01.992 --> 01:35:05.634]  I've talked to a lot of big media people down in Latin America.
[01:35:05.654 --> 01:35:09.557]  Just talked to one in Ecuador last week, the equivalent of their 60 minutes.
[01:35:10.278 --> 01:35:12.779]  They taped an interview and they said, oh yes, we understand.
[01:35:12.819 --> 01:35:15.882]  I used to be a leftist, but now we understand that they control both the left and the right.
[01:35:16.681 --> 01:35:22.323]  And you notice now Perkins, who is this big economic hitman, he's now the left and wants the global carbon tax.
[01:35:22.343 --> 01:35:29.005]  See, and I think Perkins, who we've met with and interviewed for the film, I think he really believes it.
[01:35:30.485 --> 01:35:31.285]  I'm not that smart.
[01:35:31.365 --> 01:35:34.326]  How do I get the different systems and the manipulations that other people don't?
[01:35:34.866 --> 01:35:36.887]  How do I understand PR, but other people don't?
[01:35:37.407 --> 01:35:38.627]  I mean, I don't understand it.
[01:35:38.868 --> 01:35:40.148]  Look, I spent enough time with you, John.
[01:35:40.828 --> 01:35:43.289]  I'm not trying to fight with you, but just for God's sakes.
[01:35:44.315 --> 01:35:46.296]  You know, heaven's sakes.
[01:35:46.836 --> 01:35:48.117]  Donna, in New Hampshire.
[01:35:48.137 --> 01:35:48.857]  You're on the air, Donna.
[01:35:49.818 --> 01:35:50.438]  Hi, Alex.
[01:35:50.498 --> 01:35:53.179]  If there was anybody more fair and balanced, it would be you.
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.081]  I totally disagree with John.
[01:35:57.021 --> 01:35:59.162]  I have been a listener for you for over ten years.
[01:35:59.542 --> 01:36:04.365]  What I wanted to say is I think this letter that Charlie Sheen wrote is spot on.
[01:36:04.805 --> 01:36:06.326]  I think it's great publicity.
[01:36:07.006 --> 01:36:13.469]  Maybe people should put letters to the editors out in all their publications, in all their magazines and newspapers around the country.
[01:36:14.233 --> 01:36:22.097]  And I plan on being down in New York on 9-11, and I will be out there protesting with one of my Alex Jones t-shirts.
[01:36:23.758 --> 01:36:24.438]  Well, awesome!
[01:36:24.718 --> 01:36:31.002]  And again, Charlie's saying, OK, I went public to get more people to go public, and a lot of folks through his courage did.
[01:36:31.322 --> 01:36:33.123]  He's saying, I'm going public even bigger now.
[01:36:33.963 --> 01:36:36.965]  He's going on my show repeatedly, live this week, video.
[01:36:37.285 --> 01:36:38.285]  He's going to do media.
[01:36:40.747 --> 01:36:41.527]  Not just my show.
[01:36:42.919 --> 01:36:50.425]  And he's kind of taking my advice on what I think he should do and shouldn't do, so people can send us emails at sheenandinfowars.com of your media.
[01:36:51.025 --> 01:36:55.008]  But I've got the national media calling me saying, is this really Charlie Sheen's letter?
[01:36:55.028 --> 01:36:55.749]  Did he really write this?
[01:36:56.089 --> 01:36:58.270]  Yes, Charlie Sheen's been on the show before, you just heard him.
[01:36:58.491 --> 01:37:02.073]  So I keep playing the clip, the short clip, the bigger clips are coming up tomorrow, and the live stuff.
[01:37:02.774 --> 01:37:05.476]  And this is real, and Charlie's asking people
[01:37:06.670 --> 01:37:12.572]  To go out and to get politically active, and he wants the media and press conferences to ask Obama about his letter?
[01:37:13.072 --> 01:37:14.592]  That's why it's done in that context.
[01:37:14.672 --> 01:37:16.112]  This is the meeting he wants to have.
[01:37:16.353 --> 01:37:19.573]  He wants to make this about Obama facing this.
[01:37:19.853 --> 01:37:23.974]  So this is a way to publicly face him in a simulation of a meeting.
[01:37:23.994 --> 01:37:24.535]  Do you understand?
[01:37:24.555 --> 01:37:26.435]  I understand perfectly.
[01:37:26.515 --> 01:37:33.577]  And the other thing is, too, that even reading this letter, I have been, you know, right on board with 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:37:34.171 --> 01:37:38.795]  And he brought some things to my attention that I did even research myself.
[01:37:39.036 --> 01:37:43.700]  Six of the ten 9-11 commissions have come out publicly.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.602]  So he is bringing even more information.
[01:37:46.642 --> 01:37:51.607]  You can tell he has definitely, definitely did the research himself.
[01:37:51.727 --> 01:37:53.509]  Nobody is spoon feeding Charlie Sheen.
[01:37:54.049 --> 01:37:56.511]  No, no, Charlie did 90% of the work.
[01:37:56.551 --> 01:37:59.134]  I mean, I would sit there on his back porch with him.
[01:38:00.285 --> 01:38:02.186]  For like 10 hours, then we go inside.
[01:38:02.846 --> 01:38:06.347]  When it got dark, with the laptops out, researching.
[01:38:06.387 --> 01:38:09.008]  And he did 90% of the letter.
[01:38:09.388 --> 01:38:12.289]  And then the rest, putting it all together and presenting it, we did.
[01:38:12.309 --> 01:38:15.730]  We do a perfect job, but... No, no.
[01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:22.413]  I mean, Charlie Sheen is just such a focused, passionate, serious, professional humanitarian.
[01:38:22.473 --> 01:38:25.534]  I mean, he doesn't do this... Probably don't want me to tell this story, but...
[01:38:27.449 --> 01:38:35.662]  When Charlie drives to work, there's this big, long, giant hill, like a mile and a half, that all the help for the gated community he lives in come up to.
[01:38:36.584 --> 01:38:39.990]  And the bus stops down the hill and these people walk up.
[01:38:41.164 --> 01:38:50.490]  And Charlie, and his dad, and when he comes to the house, they stop almost every day and give people rides up and down the hill.
[01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:52.051]  And the media never knew that.
[01:38:52.071 --> 01:38:58.315]  I mean, that's what's so sick about this is, he's so private, so quiet, he doesn't want accolades, he doesn't want praise for this.
[01:38:58.656 --> 01:39:01.197]  He knows they blew up the towers, he's freaked out by it.
[01:39:01.698 --> 01:39:03.019]  He can't go to sleep over it.
[01:39:03.519 --> 01:39:06.221]  How do you know that six of the ten commissioned
[01:39:07.807 --> 01:39:12.034]  You're saying it's a fraud and the media is acting like you got three heads if you talk about it.
[01:39:12.394 --> 01:39:14.277]  I mean the sheens are real people.
[01:39:15.225 --> 01:39:22.170]  And they're not the image and the distorted view that the media, you know, puts out as purely leftist or purely right-wing.
[01:39:23.311 --> 01:39:25.833]  And, you know, they've gone through a process, too.
[01:39:26.333 --> 01:39:27.914]  A lot of it from my films and material.
[01:39:28.715 --> 01:39:30.036]  And it's happening to other people.
[01:39:30.056 --> 01:39:31.697]  And there's a revolution of ideas.
[01:39:31.717 --> 01:39:35.339]  And Charlie's like Galileo saying the Earth is not the center of the universe.
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:37.641]  You know, because he's prominent.
[01:39:37.661 --> 01:39:38.622]  He has a lot to lose.
[01:39:38.662 --> 01:39:39.442]  And it's just beautiful.
[01:39:40.043 --> 01:39:44.686]  And I hope people understand the magnitude of the courage that we're seeing here.
[01:39:46.833 --> 01:39:51.356]  And I just wanted to also wish his birthday on the same day as my father's, on September 3rd.
[01:39:51.396 --> 01:39:53.257]  And I also wanted to wish him a happy birthday.
[01:39:53.957 --> 01:39:58.940]  And, you know, great work job that you both have done, and I'm so proud of both of you.
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:08.226]  And you guys inspire us, and that's one of the reasons why I am going down to New York on September 11th, because we need a big outcry.
[01:40:08.306 --> 01:40:09.346]  We need more people.
[01:40:09.987 --> 01:40:12.428]  This has been kind of, you know, dusted under the rug.
[01:40:13.201 --> 01:40:18.546]  The 9-11 first responders, I mean, have been completely and utterly put on the back burner.
[01:40:18.866 --> 01:40:23.510]  And We Are Change has been fighting and trying to get the bills passed to just get a medical care.
[01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:24.330]  I appreciate your call.
[01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.871]  Great points.
[01:40:24.891 --> 01:40:35.780]  And then the establishment that committed these atrocities, they sit there and pose like, oh, it's for the firemen and police and military when they're blocking basic health care because they knew from day one the dust was going to kill them.
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:36.961]  And now what is it?
[01:40:36.981 --> 01:40:39.283]  4,000 first responders plus have died.
[01:40:39.443 --> 01:40:44.087]  All the police dogs have died as of years ago of all these weird cancers.
[01:40:46.089 --> 01:40:51.354]  Mount Sinai and all these other big facilities in California and New York have done the scans.
[01:40:53.117 --> 01:40:53.877]  of their lungs.
[01:40:53.917 --> 01:40:54.918]  You can, in fact, Google that.
[01:40:56.118 --> 01:41:00.939]  CT scans prove WTC workers have deadly dust.
[01:41:01.199 --> 01:41:06.361]  We can pull up the headlines, but the point is that the EPA was ordered to cover that up.
[01:41:06.721 --> 01:41:08.081]  But here's another example.
[01:41:10.202 --> 01:41:16.364]  I was telling people months ago, well, years ago, I said, go to city council, go to congressmen's public meetings, go to these town halls.
[01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:17.324]  Go!
[01:41:17.444 --> 01:41:18.384]  Take over the events!
[01:41:18.464 --> 01:41:19.505]  Bring up real issues!
[01:41:20.410 --> 01:41:22.494]  And the media a couple months ago said, oh, it's all fake.
[01:41:22.534 --> 01:41:25.299]  Republicans are financing this against the socialist healthcare.
[01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:27.302]  It's eugenics healthcare, not even socialist.
[01:41:27.743 --> 01:41:28.725]  All this is happening.
[01:41:30.754 --> 01:41:35.177]  And they just went on and on and on and on, saying it wasn't real.
[01:41:35.197 --> 01:41:36.658]  And later they had to admit, OK, it's real.
[01:41:36.778 --> 01:41:37.939]  OK, you're not AstroTurf.
[01:41:38.339 --> 01:41:39.460]  OK, you're not Nazis.
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:42.222]  OK, our union people have been ordered to beat you up.
[01:41:42.462 --> 01:41:44.643]  And the White House is ordering people to snitch and spy.
[01:41:44.904 --> 01:41:45.604]  And think about this.
[01:41:45.664 --> 01:41:50.327]  Obama comes out two weeks ago and says, we're going to ask your kids to work for us and to help us.
[01:41:50.968 --> 01:41:54.190]  And Al Gore is out telling kids, don't believe your parents about man-made global warming.
[01:41:54.230 --> 01:41:54.830]  They're wrong.
[01:41:55.190 --> 01:41:55.791]  It's real.
[01:41:56.031 --> 01:41:56.912]  Your parents are wrong.
[01:41:57.292 --> 01:41:58.773]  That was all in the teaching materials.
[01:41:59.013 --> 01:42:00.196]  They had to take that out.
[01:42:00.436 --> 01:42:03.423]  So then he gives this milquetoast speech and says, oh, much ado about nothing.
[01:42:03.724 --> 01:42:05.768]  I just said stay out in school and off drugs.
[01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:10.792]  See how they do these PsyOps, these bait-and-switches?
[01:42:11.353 --> 01:42:13.776]  And they just do it right out in front of everybody.
[01:42:14.376 --> 01:42:15.478]  But it still doesn't matter.
[01:42:15.538 --> 01:42:16.539]  People see right through that.
[01:42:16.819 --> 01:42:19.862]  People see right through the fact that it does get rid of your own insurance.
[01:42:19.902 --> 01:42:21.564]  It does take control of the doctors.
[01:42:21.604 --> 01:42:22.725]  We've read the subsections.
[01:42:23.126 --> 01:42:27.611]  It does have the eugenics, bioethics panels that decide when you can live and when you can die.
[01:42:28.031 --> 01:42:28.792]  It's all in there.
[01:42:28.832 --> 01:42:29.473]  It's all real.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:34.804]  Mike, Chris, and many others, your calls are coming up.
[01:42:34.824 --> 01:42:35.184]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:42:36.105 --> 01:42:37.526]  Continuing with your phone calls.
[01:42:38.247 --> 01:42:40.710]  Some financial news coming up next that just makes my head spin.
[01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:42.011]  Everything's happening at once.
[01:42:42.431 --> 01:42:44.093]  These are the times that try men's soul.
[01:42:44.453 --> 01:42:46.616]  History is taking place right now on so many fronts.
[01:42:46.716 --> 01:42:47.316]  Be active.
[01:42:47.717 --> 01:42:48.377]  Be involved.
[01:42:48.718 --> 01:42:51.200]  You can change history right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:51.541 --> 01:42:53.062]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:42:53.082 --> 01:42:53.483]  Stay with us.
[01:43:00.852 --> 01:43:09.677]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:19.503]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.

[01:43:56.064 --> 01:43:57.605]  It's here.
[01:43:57.625 --> 01:44:09.133]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:44:09.514 --> 01:44:17.139]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:44:17.856 --> 01:44:24.921]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:44:25.282 --> 01:44:36.710]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:40.553]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:44:40.993 --> 01:44:42.935]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:44:43.255 --> 01:44:47.038]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:45:00.632 --> 01:45:02.393]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[01:45:02.693 --> 01:45:05.375]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[01:45:05.635 --> 01:45:07.576]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[01:45:07.877 --> 01:45:08.637]  Here's the story.
[01:45:08.857 --> 01:45:13.440]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:14.661]  Now here's the bad news.
[01:45:14.901 --> 01:45:18.083]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands.
[01:45:18.343 --> 01:45:18.743]  We're good to go.
[01:45:43.414 --> 01:45:48.301]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[01:45:48.602 --> 01:45:52.527]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[01:45:52.707 --> 01:45:55.491]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[01:46:09.773 --> 01:46:11.455]  Want to give a shout out to Charlie Sheen.
[01:46:11.495 --> 01:46:12.476]  Just text messaged me.
[01:46:12.536 --> 01:46:17.922]  He's listening to the show and listening to the folks that are calling in.
[01:46:17.962 --> 01:46:23.128]  We'll take more of your calls, your comments on his courage and what he's doing coming up.
[01:46:23.909 --> 01:46:25.891]  Again, we have a completely new interview.
[01:46:26.872 --> 01:46:29.033]  Earlier I aired a few minutes of 2006.
[01:46:29.414 --> 01:46:31.835]  We aired a little clip of his new comments.
[01:46:31.875 --> 01:46:36.277]  I'm getting a lot of requests and calls and emails to re-air it as people continue to tune in.
[01:46:36.658 --> 01:46:41.881]  So I'll play that again coming up next hour, just that minute clip of Charlie commenting on his letter to the President.
[01:46:42.521 --> 01:46:48.144]  But right now, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because we can't ignore what's going on here.
[01:46:49.365 --> 01:46:52.307]  UN panel calls for dollar reserve role to be eliminated.
[01:46:52.367 --> 01:46:54.168]  The end of the dollar, the devaluation.
[01:46:55.377 --> 01:47:07.049]  Mainstream media is reporting that they believe the London Telegraph, top economists believe there may be a complete dollar devaluation, just like what happened
[01:47:09.569 --> 01:47:11.691]  Uh, in Argentina a few years ago.
[01:47:11.771 --> 01:47:13.652]  This is what we've been saying they're planning to do.
[01:47:14.392 --> 01:47:17.755]  But the headline is, Barack Obama accused of making depression mistakes.
[01:47:18.095 --> 01:47:19.035]  None of this is a mistake.
[01:47:19.056 --> 01:47:20.316]  Barack Obama hasn't done this.
[01:47:20.336 --> 01:47:21.477]  He's just a puppet frontman.
[01:47:22.037 --> 01:47:25.200]  You had total unison of policy from Bush to Obama.
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:29.522]  And before that, Clinton is the one that got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act to allow this to happen.
[01:47:29.983 --> 01:47:32.625]  The banks gave themselves unlimited money on your dying.
[01:47:33.425 --> 01:47:36.786]  Ted Anderson, gold went to, what, $1,008 today.
[01:47:37.146 --> 01:47:40.327]  And I just wanted to briefly have you up here.
[01:47:40.347 --> 01:47:42.787]  We've been saying it was going to go above $1,000, all the evidence showed.
[01:47:43.448 --> 01:47:47.789]  Because, what, you've still got some gold you bought at the $840, I mean at the $940 range.
[01:47:47.809 --> 01:47:51.009]  $60-something dollars under what it's trading under right now.
[01:47:51.029 --> 01:47:53.110]  I wanted to give people an opportunity to call Midas Resources.
[01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:55.190]  Yeah, I would say it would be a good time.
[01:47:55.530 --> 01:47:59.071]  Obviously, where this first started was over in the Far East.
[01:47:59.171 --> 01:48:01.552]  China wants to get out of the dollar in the worst way.
[01:48:02.190 --> 01:48:03.931]  And it was happening while we were sleeping.
[01:48:03.972 --> 01:48:06.033]  Gold went up over $1,000 an ounce.
[01:48:06.554 --> 01:48:10.036]  London was trying to sell to suppress it down, but they lost that battle.
[01:48:10.417 --> 01:48:20.905]  And now here, right now at this particular moment, even with all the selling pressure that's occurring here in the United States, the best they can do is $9.9820, and gold has already gone to $1,008.
[01:48:22.526 --> 01:48:45.138]  90 silver almost 17 dollars an ounce now 1680 at a high today right now currently 1646 so yeah definitely a lot of pressure on on gold and silver Alex here's what I've been that's what's been occurring here as a dealer I've been trying to stock up on these on these British sovereigns and Franks and the British sovereigns I mean I tell you
[01:48:45.951 --> 01:48:48.492]  I was having a hard time getting any supply at all.
[01:48:48.612 --> 01:48:53.494]  It's just like a replay of what happened a year ago, or a year and a half ago, when gold did this.
[01:48:54.335 --> 01:48:55.835]  I couldn't get enough supply.
[01:48:55.875 --> 01:48:57.036]  There wasn't anything to sell.
[01:48:57.056 --> 01:49:00.717]  I was lucky to find a bag of junk silver to offer to my customers, you know?
[01:49:01.118 --> 01:49:03.219]  And this stuff is usually available all the time.
[01:49:03.579 --> 01:49:06.140]  And that is occurring right now, again, as we speak.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:09.481]  So if you're looking at getting into gold and silver, now's the time to do it.
[01:49:09.961 --> 01:49:12.503]  I do have in my stock, currently, Frank's at $223.
[01:49:13.755 --> 01:49:15.736]  I'm sorry, $2.33 right now.
[01:49:16.197 --> 01:49:20.099]  I have British Sovereigns currently right now in my stock at $288.
[01:49:20.159 --> 01:49:33.208]  That Walking Liberty Half Alex, that is at $8.69, far beyond the best buy that I have in my entire inventory, because that reflects silver prices down towards $11 an ounce.
[01:49:34.828 --> 01:49:38.070]  Lakota Nation rounds right now are trading at $22.30.
[01:49:38.490 --> 01:49:41.352]  So just to give you some examples, we do have some other things, too.
[01:49:41.752 --> 01:49:43.833]  We just don't have enough time to talk about everything.
[01:49:44.193 --> 01:49:49.116]  But right now, with the pressure going downward, I mean, the support level in the marketplace was $9.45.
[01:49:49.256 --> 01:49:51.237]  It didn't break through that.
[01:49:51.597 --> 01:49:59.281]  Going up over $1,000, it wouldn't surprise me if we start seeing that level that Bloomberg is talking about, which is running... Well, let me be clear, Ted.
[01:49:59.321 --> 01:50:00.422]  How high did gold go today?
[01:50:00.962 --> 01:50:02.143]  Gold went to $1,850 already at this point.
[01:50:05.607 --> 01:50:06.468]  Just amazing.
[01:50:06.528 --> 01:50:09.209]  And the gold and silver you're selling, you bought at what level?
[01:50:09.329 --> 01:50:09.209]  9.45.
[01:50:09.349 --> 01:50:13.712]  9.45 is exactly where I picked that stuff up.
[01:50:13.772 --> 01:50:17.374]  And so you're selling people at the market price of 9.45.
[01:50:17.955 --> 01:50:21.397]  When the market was at 9.45, that's the price that was factored in in the market.
[01:50:21.697 --> 01:50:22.718]  When it's now above 1,000, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:50:22.778 --> 01:50:23.878]  The brokers are there right now.
[01:50:23.918 --> 01:50:25.720]  They will be there until midnight tonight, 800-686.
[01:50:31.443 --> 01:50:32.744]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:50:51.018 --> 01:50:53.621]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:50:54.021 --> 01:50:58.986]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:50:59.346 --> 01:51:01.088]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:51:01.408 --> 01:51:06.233]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:51:06.413 --> 01:51:07.334]  How much do you want?
[01:51:07.574 --> 01:51:08.335]  When do you want it?
[01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:10.296]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:51:10.576 --> 01:51:11.417]  When will you need it?
[01:51:11.657 --> 01:51:13.718]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:51:13.858 --> 01:51:14.959]  Will there be any food?
[01:51:15.199 --> 01:51:16.540]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:21.804]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:51:22.004 --> 01:51:25.186]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:51:25.586 --> 01:51:29.049]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:51:29.389 --> 01:51:30.389]  How much will you need?
[01:51:30.609 --> 01:51:31.229]  We don't know.
[01:51:31.509 --> 01:51:32.430]  How much do you want?
[01:51:32.630 --> 01:51:33.370]  All you can get.
[01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:34.390]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:34.650 --> 01:51:37.411]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:51:37.691 --> 01:51:38.051]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:38.211 --> 01:51:39.871]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:51:39.891 --> 01:51:40.871]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:40.891 --> 01:51:42.072]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:42.112 --> 01:51:43.892]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:08.120]  It's the final hour.
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:11.203]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls about the big Charlie Sheen story.
[01:52:11.543 --> 01:52:14.145]  Top economists, mainstream news trying to kill the dollar.
[01:52:14.565 --> 01:52:16.807]  Bad-mouthing and say we could become Argentina.
[01:52:17.307 --> 01:52:19.109]  That's all part of the banking global takeover.
[01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:21.130]  They have to bankrupt us to get control of us.
[01:52:21.150 --> 01:52:21.650]  It's simple.
[01:52:22.491 --> 01:52:23.632]  Military economics.
[01:52:25.994 --> 01:52:26.734]  Charlie Sheen.
[01:52:28.435 --> 01:52:28.876]  Coming up.
[01:52:29.496 --> 01:52:30.357]  Live interviews.
[01:52:31.438 --> 01:52:32.578]  Wednesday and Friday.
[01:52:32.678 --> 01:52:34.260]  Video interview Thursday.
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:35.861]  All coming up.
[01:52:38.206 --> 01:52:39.727]  Just so much is happening right now.
[01:52:40.087 --> 01:52:41.388]  I'm about to go back to your calls.
[01:52:43.450 --> 01:52:51.595]  We're going to go to Mike, Chris, John, David, Jeff, and others here in just a moment.
[01:52:51.615 --> 01:52:54.217]  I want to say hi to Charlie Sheen, listening right now.
[01:52:54.237 --> 01:52:59.441]  Again, Charlie's not live with us today because he wants people, because the media will just take the interview he's done.
[01:53:01.906 --> 01:53:04.367]  The interviews that are coming up, and the live ones, and just make it about that.
[01:53:04.427 --> 01:53:07.389]  He wants to focus everything on 20 minutes with the President.
[01:53:07.809 --> 01:53:13.512]  With the letter, with the piece he wrote, that has the material, mirroring the real meeting he wants to have with the President.
[01:53:13.812 --> 01:53:16.774]  Hey, side issue, Ted, what do you think of the whole Charlie Sheen situation?
[01:53:21.336 --> 01:53:24.218]  Ted is having a problem with his microphone.
[01:53:26.439 --> 01:53:28.420]  Ted, what do you think of this whole Charlie Sheen story?
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:33.132]  Yeah, I just think that it's great that a guy like that in his position...
[01:53:33.829 --> 01:53:37.770]  Is willing to risk it all and put it on the line and talk about this particular story.
[01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:44.632]  I mean, we all seen what happened here not too long ago when, you know, back when 9-11 actually happened and then a few years later.
[01:53:44.652 --> 01:53:50.534]  I mean, if the conservatives, the, what would you call them?
[01:53:51.174 --> 01:53:54.295]  The neocons, the fake conservatives that triple the size of government?
[01:53:54.595 --> 01:53:55.615]  Yeah, the neocons.
[01:53:55.655 --> 01:54:00.197]  I mean, if you're just going to mention that 9-11 was an inside job, I mean, you're going to be labeled as crazy.
[01:54:00.217 --> 01:54:01.417]  You should be wearing a tin hat.
[01:54:02.658 --> 01:54:14.091]  Well, what about how the New York Times reported that the White House called up and threatened Mark Cuban and then sicced the Securities and Exchange Commission on him to punish him and then he had to go to court and beat him.
[01:54:14.151 --> 01:54:16.494]  I mean, folks, that shows how guilty they are.
[01:54:16.874 --> 01:54:19.255]  Well, that's the kind of crap that they pull.
[01:54:19.635 --> 01:54:22.857]  I mean, there's just so much political pressure to keep this thing under hat.
[01:54:23.197 --> 01:54:37.943]  I mean, like you said earlier, Alex, if you expose the fact that there are false flag attacks, it's one of the biggest tools that the Illuminati or the people that are controlling, calling the shots in the world, you take that tool away from them, they're not going to be able to wage war.
[01:54:38.243 --> 01:54:44.146]  You don't wage war, then the United States government gets a chance to get away from this central banking system.
[01:54:45.506 --> 01:54:47.988]  I mean, that's the way I look at it, and that's why I see it coming down.
[01:54:48.468 --> 01:54:50.170]  And my hat's off to Charlie Sheen.
[01:54:50.190 --> 01:54:52.011]  I just think it's great that he's doing what he's doing.
[01:54:53.192 --> 01:54:53.892]  Absolutely.
[01:54:54.232 --> 01:54:56.314]  And we've got some newspapers calling.
[01:54:56.334 --> 01:54:57.815]  We've had TV calling here.
[01:54:57.975 --> 01:55:00.617]  I'm on air, so I have trouble going and calling them back.
[01:55:00.897 --> 01:55:04.600]  But I'll be off air in about 55 minutes, and I'll be able to deal with that.
[01:55:07.338 --> 01:55:15.744]  And then we need to call the Associated Press and get them to cover it, because once they cover it, then all the rest of the media is going to pile on.
[01:55:15.844 --> 01:55:24.250]  And the whole point is, six of the ten commissioners, Ted, said the whole commission was a fraud and a lie, and there was a, quote, criminal cover-up by the White House and Pentagon.
[01:55:24.590 --> 01:55:29.274]  Now, how is that kooky to go, hey, the commissioners said it was all a lie, there should be a new investigation?
[01:55:29.634 --> 01:55:32.196]  I mean, this is something the establishment hopes we don't look at.
[01:55:32.496 --> 01:55:36.019]  And as Michael Savage has even said, Barack Obama is going to stage a terror attack.
[01:55:36.739 --> 01:55:37.540]  To get his agenda through.
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:39.781]  Well, that's the problem.
[01:55:39.821 --> 01:55:47.025]  That's the ace in the hole, the card that the President has, or the people that the President bows to.
[01:55:47.105 --> 01:55:54.830]  I mean, let's face it, Barack Obama came in and he was going to end the wars, if you remember right, and he's not ending the wars, he's accelerating them.
[01:55:54.910 --> 01:56:00.753]  And the reason why that's happening is because the people that he answers to are the same people that George Bush answered to.
[01:56:01.233 --> 01:56:05.716]  And so if you think you have a full new deal here with Barack Obama in comparison to George Bush,
[01:56:06.178 --> 01:56:06.758]  Think again.
[01:56:06.778 --> 01:56:11.599]  I mean, Barack Obama has no more to do with this than Pinocchio has.
[01:56:11.659 --> 01:56:15.460]  I mean, the President of the United States is clearly just a puppet.
[01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:20.241]  And whatever they run on is always a hogwash and a bunch of lies anyways.
[01:56:20.861 --> 01:56:26.403]  There's an agenda, alright, but the agenda isn't being put forth by our politicians.
[01:56:26.463 --> 01:56:32.664]  It's being put forth by some very wealthy business people that control the currencies of the world.
[01:56:35.046 --> 01:56:35.646]  Absolutely.
[01:56:35.666 --> 01:56:41.189]  And folks, again, Ted told you he bought gold at the $9.45 level, silver at a lower level.
[01:56:41.429 --> 01:56:44.730]  He's running out of these supplies to get it at a price you're not going to find anywhere else.
[01:56:45.110 --> 01:56:47.371]  Give Ted Anderson a call at Minus Resources, 800-686-2237.
[01:56:47.391 --> 01:56:47.651]  800-686-2237 right now.
[01:56:47.671 --> 01:56:50.392]  And tell him it's the Alex Jones Special to get those prices.
[01:56:50.432 --> 01:56:51.673]  If not, you'll be paying $1,000 an ounce.
[01:56:51.693 --> 01:56:52.573]  Thank you so much, Ted.
[01:57:00.273 --> 01:57:05.440]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:07.523]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:57:07.663 --> 01:57:09.946]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:57:10.106 --> 01:57:11.949]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:57:12.389 --> 01:57:13.731]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:57:13.991 --> 01:57:15.053]  There is a solution.
[01:57:15.273 --> 01:57:23.276]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:58:01.037 --> 01:58:07.362]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:07.742 --> 01:58:09.404]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:10.362 --> 01:58:11.403]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:11.923 --> 01:58:12.403]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:12.703 --> 01:58:13.724]  This is his M.O.
[01:58:13.744 --> 01:58:15.005]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:58:15.085 --> 01:58:16.746]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:58:17.086 --> 01:58:23.830]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:24.670]  Some U.S.
[01:58:24.710 --> 01:58:30.334]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:58:31.054 --> 01:58:34.537]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:58:34.557 --> 01:58:36.738]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:00.905 --> 01:59:03.929]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:59:04.269 --> 01:59:07.893]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:59:08.174 --> 01:59:11.638]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:59:11.918 --> 01:59:18.386]  At less than $0.02 per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine,
[01:59:22.363 --> 01:59:22.723]  We're good.

[02:00:05.552 --> 02:00:09.737]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.397 --> 02:00:11.198]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.979 --> 02:00:12.820]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.541 --> 02:00:17.225]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.725 --> 02:00:21.790]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.286 --> 02:00:31.091]  Continuing with your phone calls, Charlie Sheen is asking the American people and the people of the world to stand with him for 9-11 Truth.
[02:00:31.111 --> 02:00:36.755]  9-11 Truth has just continued to get bigger and bigger and bigger, but the media in the last year or so has quit covering it.
[02:00:39.897 --> 02:00:45.401]  And then now they're coming back with counter-strikes to try to rewrite history in preparation to stage more attacks.
[02:00:45.421 --> 02:00:46.702]  Did you guys find the savage clip?
[02:00:48.066 --> 02:00:53.108]  I want to play this clip of Savage a few months ago, saying Obama is going to stage a Reichstag event, and I agree.
[02:00:53.448 --> 02:01:07.433]  There's no way by Obama, his controllers, the global corporate scammers that are involved in a hostile takeover of our country, if we don't expose false flag terror even further, they are going to stage more attacks in the future.
[02:01:07.873 --> 02:01:12.714]  By exposing the Hegelian dialectic, we take this tool away from them and break it in front of their faces.
[02:01:13.235 --> 02:01:14.055]  Here's Michael Savage.
[02:01:17.071 --> 02:01:18.291]  Now I'll make another prediction.
[02:01:18.812 --> 02:01:25.914]  I predict that very soon, Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire.
[02:01:26.534 --> 02:01:44.260]  I don't know what form it will take, but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are, Rahm Emanuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind, and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War, when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[02:01:44.967 --> 02:01:48.110]  I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep.
[02:01:48.611 --> 02:01:56.198]  I put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on earth.
[02:01:56.819 --> 02:02:03.065]  Know, my friends, I am losing a great deal of sleep every night because I do see this happening right before my eyes.
[02:02:03.125 --> 02:02:04.527]  Again, I will repeat what I just said.
[02:02:04.967 --> 02:02:05.608]  Mark it down.
[02:02:06.248 --> 02:02:10.572]  I again tell you that there will be the equivalent of a crisis on the order of the Reichstag fire.
[02:02:11.073 --> 02:02:12.374]  I don't know where it will occur.
[02:02:12.494 --> 02:02:13.635]  I don't know how it will occur.
[02:02:13.976 --> 02:02:15.397]  I don't know what form it will take.
[02:02:15.877 --> 02:02:25.707]  But during this crisis that will be triggered by the Democrats around Obama, the gang that surrounds Obama, they will bring up Lincoln.
[02:02:26.394 --> 02:02:40.878]  They will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln in other terms during the Civil War, and they will do what Lincoln did, and they will arrest civilians without warrant in the name of saving the economy or saving the government from a right-wing takeover.
[02:02:41.258 --> 02:02:45.120]  Mark my words, you can put that down and you can put it in bronze, not on ice.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:46.620]  Alright.
[02:02:48.991 --> 02:02:52.435]  What is former Republican leader of the House, Dick Armey, saying?
[02:02:52.475 --> 02:02:58.140]  He's saying they're staging the crises of the flu as a pretext to pass their whole agenda through in the fall and winter.
[02:02:58.941 --> 02:02:59.962]  What is Ron Paul saying?
[02:03:00.022 --> 02:03:02.024]  They could use a crisis to bring under control.
[02:03:02.044 --> 02:03:03.326]  What is Congressman Brown doing?
[02:03:03.706 --> 02:03:04.547]  Saying the same thing.
[02:03:07.050 --> 02:03:12.075]  We understand how these globalists operate and what they're doing and
[02:03:13.959 --> 02:03:16.480]  That's why this is key, what Charlie Sheen is doing right now.
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:18.960]  And that's why he put it in the context.
[02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:21.201]  If Charlie would have just gone public, it would have gotten a lot of attention.
[02:03:21.621 --> 02:03:24.941]  But not attention involved with Obama, that he wants the meeting with Obama.
[02:03:25.362 --> 02:03:29.442]  By writing this article about what he believes will happen in a meeting with Obama.
[02:03:30.243 --> 02:03:36.004]  And then handing Obama the briefings, then the public is briefed by reading 20 Minutes with the President.
[02:03:36.364 --> 02:03:38.004]  Please get it, get it out to everybody.
[02:03:38.324 --> 02:03:40.985]  It's on InfoWars.com, it's on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:03:42.543 --> 02:03:44.323]  I'm told it's about to go out on the news wires.
[02:03:44.964 --> 02:03:52.265]  We've had some newspapers and TV calling, but I am tied down here on the air, which is great, but I need to go in there and call the media back and deal with some of this.
[02:03:53.286 --> 02:03:59.687]  But every radio station, every local TV station, CNN, Fox, all of them, email 20 Minutes with the President to him.
[02:04:01.608 --> 02:04:05.048]  Send this other article, Charlie Sheen requests meeting with Obama over 9-1-1 cover-up.
[02:04:05.108 --> 02:04:05.588]  Get it out!
[02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:09.649]  And just like last time, it'll take a day or two to really break mega-massive.
[02:04:11.170 --> 02:04:11.790]  It's up to you.
[02:04:13.038 --> 02:04:14.439]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:04:15.099 --> 02:04:16.520]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:16.960]  Go ahead.
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:21.182]  Mr. Jones, I just want to say it's an honor and a pleasure to speak with you.
[02:04:21.242 --> 02:04:21.922]  You're a great man.
[02:04:22.922 --> 02:04:24.763]  Well, I don't know about that, but I try my best.
[02:04:24.783 --> 02:04:25.264]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:04:26.424 --> 02:04:29.305]  I just wanted to comment on the article that Mr. Sheen wrote.
[02:04:29.846 --> 02:04:36.449]  I woke up this morning and pretty much the first thing I did was get up and... Go ahead.
[02:04:36.469 --> 02:04:37.229]  Your phone's cutting out.
[02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:40.072]  No, I thought it was, but I guess I'm okay.
[02:04:40.192 --> 02:04:41.132]  Somebody's calling you.
[02:04:41.172 --> 02:04:42.413]  That's like call waiting.
[02:04:42.914 --> 02:04:43.894]  Everybody always stops.
[02:04:43.915 --> 02:04:45.896]  When somebody calls you, it clicks.
[02:04:46.937 --> 02:04:49.419]  Yeah, it's not worth answering, believe me.
[02:04:49.459 --> 02:04:49.999]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:04:50.019 --> 02:04:50.900]  You're on air worldwide.
[02:04:51.590 --> 02:04:51.850]  All right.
[02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:55.471]  I read that this morning and was completely blown away by it.
[02:04:55.531 --> 02:04:57.892]  Mr. Sheen, if you're listening, I just want to say thank you.
[02:04:58.352 --> 02:05:00.373]  You've definitely refreshed my views about you.
[02:05:01.193 --> 02:05:03.674]  It's good to know that you're out there and doing that for the people.
[02:05:04.434 --> 02:05:08.555]  And if you don't mind, I'd like to give some kudos to DJ Chris Geo while I'm at it.
[02:05:09.516 --> 02:05:10.156]  Okay, thank you.
[02:05:10.176 --> 02:05:11.096]  I appreciate your call.
[02:05:11.116 --> 02:05:12.096]  There go the great kudos.
[02:05:12.997 --> 02:05:15.157]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:05:15.637 --> 02:05:16.898]  Chris in New York.
[02:05:16.958 --> 02:05:17.798]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:05:18.678 --> 02:05:19.479]  Alex, how are you?
[02:05:19.559 --> 02:05:20.499]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:21.710]  Thanks for calling, sir.
[02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:22.411]  What's on your mind?
[02:05:23.171 --> 02:05:33.297]  I just want to say how I commend and I think it's incredibly courageous what Charlie Sheen is doing, all he's putting up, as opposed to just talking.
[02:05:33.637 --> 02:05:44.283]  And myself, I plan on being out there on Friday with all the protesters, with my Don't Tread On Me t-shirts, and I have an idea that people can also get the word out.
[02:05:44.984 --> 02:05:49.146]  Make copies of the videos, like you said, and I plan on downloading and printing
[02:05:50.035 --> 02:05:53.861]  The 20 minutes with the President, just walk in your neighborhood, stick them in people's mailboxes.
[02:05:54.122 --> 02:05:56.125]  You know, they don't want them, they don't want them.
[02:05:56.145 --> 02:06:01.353]  But sooner or later, people are going to start listening and start waking up a lot more than they are now.
[02:06:02.825 --> 02:06:03.886]  So you get it then.
[02:06:03.966 --> 02:06:09.350]  I mean, this isn't just a news story about him writing up an article about what he thinks a meeting with Obama would be like.
[02:06:09.390 --> 02:06:10.771]  It's about the information.
[02:06:11.552 --> 02:06:19.898]  And it's about capturing people's imagination about a real meeting and meetings with their county commissioners, their governors, their legislatures, their House members, their Senate members.
[02:06:20.378 --> 02:06:21.980]  Charlie is asking people.
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:26.981]  To go out and to massively expand 9-11 truth.
[02:06:27.321 --> 02:06:30.922]  Because if we don't, the same people that stage 9-11 are going to stage more.
[02:06:30.942 --> 02:06:32.883]  I mean, the presidents are puppets.
[02:06:33.523 --> 02:06:38.285]  The people behind the scenes, the National Security Council and the globalists, they're going to stage more terror.
[02:06:38.305 --> 02:06:39.345]  I mean, this is life and death.
[02:06:40.445 --> 02:06:41.385]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:06:41.526 --> 02:06:44.726]  I mean, I've been doing my own research for close to 10 years now.
[02:06:44.967 --> 02:06:46.087]  I've been aware of all of this.
[02:06:46.894 --> 02:06:56.957]  Doesn't take much time and it doesn't take much effort to click on a link or to read really what's behind the corporate media giant and all their spin they put on it.
[02:06:57.577 --> 02:06:59.697]  And I think he has the right approach, you know.
[02:07:00.498 --> 02:07:09.760]  It's all about game playing and I think what he's doing, putting it in the format he is putting it in, is great because he's just giving it right back to him.
[02:07:11.582 --> 02:07:23.405]  Absolutely, and again, it's up to the people to drive this out into a huge national news story before the media gets it, because they are starting to cover it, before the media grabs it and tries to spin it or turn it around.
[02:07:24.286 --> 02:07:27.246]  That's why we play just this short clip, and I appreciate your call.
[02:07:27.527 --> 02:07:33.608]  Let's play just that short clip of a longer interview coming up tomorrow, and then Sheen Live, of my interview with Sheen about this letter.
[02:07:33.908 --> 02:07:34.329]  Here it is.
[02:07:34.349 --> 02:07:35.789]  This is his short statement on it.
[02:07:36.803 --> 02:07:38.064]  Charlie, it's great to be here with you.
[02:07:38.084 --> 02:07:40.085]  I appreciate you doing this interview.
[02:07:40.205 --> 02:07:40.866]  Likewise, Alex.
[02:07:40.886 --> 02:07:41.206]  Thank you.
[02:07:41.606 --> 02:07:46.189]  Why, after three years of silence concerning 9-11, are you now speaking up?
[02:07:46.370 --> 02:07:50.953]  And why have you written this public letter that you've now published?
[02:07:52.054 --> 02:07:52.874]  Well, Alex...
[02:07:54.668 --> 02:07:56.870]  I wrote this letter for two reasons.
[02:07:57.631 --> 02:08:03.396]  Firstly, I wanted to create a public document specifically rooted in fact.
[02:08:04.176 --> 02:08:11.603]  If anybody dares question that, I would encourage those people to scrutinize it, to research it.
[02:08:13.357 --> 02:08:16.278]  The truth is unchanging, Alex, as we both know.
[02:08:17.059 --> 02:08:21.921]  The only aspects of this piece that had to be manufactured were the President's words.
[02:08:22.521 --> 02:08:28.203]  Everything else will withstand the critical assault I'm more than prepared to endure.
[02:08:28.923 --> 02:08:35.526]  And secondly, this is our first new President since 9-11, and consequently his first 9-11 anniversary in office.
[02:08:38.996 --> 02:08:40.037]  Enough stonewalling.
[02:08:40.097 --> 02:08:42.380]  Enough media manipulation.
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:45.063]  Enough media mantra speak.
[02:08:45.463 --> 02:08:47.586]  The families deserve better, Alex.
[02:08:47.686 --> 02:08:49.548]  America deserves better.
[02:08:49.568 --> 02:08:50.329]  I mean, come on.
[02:08:50.929 --> 02:08:51.730]  Come on, people.
[02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:56.696]  The 9-11 Commission report is a blatant work of manipulation, secrecy, and fiction.
[02:08:57.682 --> 02:08:59.403]  Come on, the time is now.
[02:08:59.523 --> 02:09:01.084]  Demand the truth.
[02:09:01.864 --> 02:09:10.308]  I personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like a new investigation is just going to fall out of the heavens right into our Congress.
[02:09:10.708 --> 02:09:11.949]  We have to take action.
[02:09:12.249 --> 02:09:13.210]  We have to stand as one.
[02:09:13.230 --> 02:09:16.431]  We must insist that our new president deliver on his promises.
[02:09:18.652 --> 02:09:19.153]  All right.
[02:09:19.653 --> 02:09:20.193]  Absolutely.
[02:09:20.213 --> 02:09:21.474]  Can't say any better than that.
[02:09:22.858 --> 02:09:25.518]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:09:25.658 --> 02:09:27.739]  David in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:09:27.799 --> 02:09:28.259]  Go ahead.
[02:09:28.279 --> 02:09:31.599]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:32.500]  Good, sir.
[02:09:32.580 --> 02:09:32.960]  Go ahead.
[02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:37.460]  I want to say thank you to you and Charlie.
[02:09:38.041 --> 02:09:41.181]  Y'all are well blessed and are true Christians.
[02:09:41.841 --> 02:09:47.402]  And the president of this country, of this nation, of this nation, about 9-11.
[02:09:47.982 --> 02:09:52.223]  I have done research and I have been following you since February.
[02:09:53.178 --> 02:10:03.286]  I have listened, uh, watched several of your videos, uh, Obama Deception and, uh, Endgame and several others that have really waken me up.
[02:10:03.922 --> 02:10:04.803]  God bless you, sir.
[02:10:05.183 --> 02:10:06.024]  I appreciate your call.
[02:10:06.044 --> 02:10:09.486]  Yes, it's Dynamite Info in the 20 Minutes with the President.
[02:10:09.786 --> 02:10:12.949]  The 20 points gives you 20-20 vision.
[02:10:13.289 --> 02:10:14.790]  The 20 minutes, 20 points.
[02:10:15.230 --> 02:10:18.212]  Read the 20 points, click on the bibliography, go to the page.
[02:10:18.553 --> 02:10:19.493]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:10:19.533 --> 02:10:20.434]  Let's take another one here.
[02:10:21.014 --> 02:10:22.535]  Let's talk to Jeff in Texas.
[02:10:22.575 --> 02:10:23.396]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:10:23.436 --> 02:10:23.756]  Welcome.
[02:10:24.477 --> 02:10:24.997]  Yeah, hi.
[02:10:25.458 --> 02:10:26.738]  I want to get your thoughts on this.
[02:10:26.778 --> 02:10:29.360]  What if we blast Savage's show this week?
[02:10:29.641 --> 02:10:32.923]  I have two family members that were diehard Savage fans.
[02:10:33.533 --> 02:10:37.176]  That have since woken up because of the work of you and others.
[02:10:37.696 --> 02:10:44.681]  Yeah, we're forcing Savage and Beck and Limbaugh to move more into the anti-New World Order area, but they still expose themselves.
[02:10:46.582 --> 02:10:46.943]  5 p.m.
[02:10:47.023 --> 02:10:49.604]  Central, can I give out the dial-in number or do you recommend that?
[02:10:50.345 --> 02:10:51.266]  Sure, you can give it out.
[02:10:51.666 --> 02:10:55.589]  It's better people just... Go ahead, give the number out.
[02:10:55.789 --> 02:11:01.453]  Yeah, 1-800-449-8255 and let's do what John Connor used to do and just force the issue over and over again.
[02:11:02.190 --> 02:11:02.630]  Exactly.
[02:11:02.670 --> 02:11:05.192]  Call in and say, hey, I want to talk about the President speaking to the kids.
[02:11:05.952 --> 02:11:13.617]  And say, yeah, we know he wanted to indoctrinate the kids and then bait and switch people so it wouldn't sound like a big deal when everybody finally looks at the speech when he changed it.
[02:11:13.897 --> 02:11:14.957]  They admit that he changed it.
[02:11:15.458 --> 02:11:20.881]  But by the way, is Obama going to respond to Charlie Sheen and his 20 questions about 9-11 being an inside job?
[02:11:20.901 --> 02:11:21.741]  Have you seen that, Michael?
[02:11:22.402 --> 02:11:23.162]  And absolutely.
[02:11:23.322 --> 02:11:24.423]  Limbaugh, all of them.
[02:11:25.243 --> 02:11:26.084]  Do it tomorrow.
[02:11:26.904 --> 02:11:28.005]  Call your local host.
[02:11:28.445 --> 02:11:29.426]  Call your local TV.
[02:11:30.728 --> 02:11:33.270]  Call the Associated Press in Texas.
[02:11:33.370 --> 02:11:35.432]  So they're looking at it when I call them when I get off air today.
[02:11:35.452 --> 02:11:39.815]  I was up until 2 in the morning, got up at 6.30 this morning, so I'm kind of brain dead.
[02:11:39.855 --> 02:11:43.358]  But I'm going to get out there, call the media, call them back.
[02:11:44.099 --> 02:11:45.440]  Call the AP all over the country.
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:48.102]  L.A., Sacramento, New York, D.C.
[02:11:48.622 --> 02:11:49.943]  Get this story out.
[02:11:50.984 --> 02:11:51.685]  We'll be right back.
[02:11:51.705 --> 02:11:52.866]  20 minutes with the President.
[02:11:52.926 --> 02:11:58.370]  Get it, email it to your whole email list, everybody you know, and then send it to all your local media and national media.
[02:11:58.991 --> 02:11:59.291]  Thank you.
[02:12:02.517 --> 02:12:02.917]  I think so.
[02:12:24.889 --> 02:12:25.249]  I think so.

[02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:52.604]  269-409-1776 today!
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:01.181]  Gold.
[02:13:01.501 --> 02:13:02.783]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:13:03.063 --> 02:13:09.151]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:13:09.331 --> 02:13:13.176]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:13:13.516 --> 02:13:15.399]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:13:15.459 --> 02:13:15.639]  Mint,
[02:13:15.979 --> 02:13:17.720]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:25.606]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:13:25.966 --> 02:13:34.852]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[02:13:41.357 --> 02:13:42.098]  We're good to go.
[02:14:02.142 --> 02:14:04.864]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:14:04.884 --> 02:14:07.146]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:14:07.186 --> 02:14:08.687]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:14:08.747 --> 02:14:10.349]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:14:10.429 --> 02:14:13.271]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:14:13.311 --> 02:14:17.514]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:14:17.554 --> 02:14:26.322]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[02:14:26.602 --> 02:14:31.466]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:14:33.539 --> 02:14:36.320]  John, how dare you?
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:42.763]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:14:42.923 --> 02:14:45.083]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:14:45.123 --> 02:14:51.866]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.
[02:14:51.886 --> 02:14:54.727]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:14:54.987 --> 02:14:56.988]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:14:57.248 --> 02:14:59.729]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:15:00.310 --> 02:15:05.652]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[02:15:06.192 --> 02:15:10.834]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[02:15:11.314 --> 02:15:11.934]  That was then.
[02:15:12.534 --> 02:15:13.195]  This is now.
[02:15:13.835 --> 02:15:16.076]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[02:15:16.556 --> 02:15:22.218]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[02:15:22.618 --> 02:15:27.900]  The DigiNet Sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings,
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:31.442]  Proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[02:15:31.823 --> 02:15:34.644]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[02:15:35.285 --> 02:15:39.268]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[02:15:39.768 --> 02:15:40.809]  Video never lies.
[02:15:41.289 --> 02:15:42.430]  Watch Big Brother back.
[02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:44.391]  Visit diginet.net.
[02:15:44.731 --> 02:15:47.253]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:15:47.693 --> 02:15:49.915]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:15:50.315 --> 02:15:51.316]  Diginet dot net.
[02:16:15.158 --> 02:16:25.324]  I'm going to recap today's top news stories in the next segment, read part of 20 Minutes with the President by Charlie Sheen, and continue with your phone calls for the balance of the transmission.
[02:16:25.384 --> 02:16:27.486]  Then, if you want to hear it all recapped in great detail,
[02:16:28.527 --> 02:16:37.092]  With my impassioned plea for a revolution of peaceful ideas, just like Gandhi called for, be the change you want to see in the world, this is happening.
[02:16:37.692 --> 02:16:51.380]  And we should all use Charlie Sheen's courage as an example of how we all need to live when it comes to standing up and challenging the establishment and challenging big lies.
[02:16:52.708 --> 02:16:55.910]  People would have stood up to Hitler and Lenin and Stalin and Mao earlier.
[02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:58.511]  Those horrors wouldn't have happened.
[02:16:59.331 --> 02:17:03.393]  Let's go back to your calls.
[02:17:03.413 --> 02:17:05.754]  In fact, who's up next here, John?
[02:17:05.794 --> 02:17:07.295]  I got so many I lost track.
[02:17:09.776 --> 02:17:11.337]  Josh in Missouri, you're on the air.
[02:17:11.397 --> 02:17:11.817]  Go ahead.
[02:17:11.837 --> 02:17:13.638]  Hi Alex, big fan.
[02:17:14.078 --> 02:17:14.558]  Thank you, sir.
[02:17:14.618 --> 02:17:14.999]  God bless you.
[02:17:15.019 --> 02:17:15.539]  What's on your mind?
[02:17:16.158 --> 02:17:20.699]  Yes, I agree with the truth of 9-11 being brought out to the American public.
[02:17:20.739 --> 02:17:23.180]  I think that it should be on the forefront of Americans' minds.
[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:28.162]  I admire Charlie Sheen for stepping up and doing his part.
[02:17:28.662 --> 02:17:34.303]  I, too, being a radio host here in the local area of Joplin, Missouri, I try to get the word out as much as possible.
[02:17:35.944 --> 02:17:45.847]  But whenever I read this, I was on the edge of my seat all weekend waiting for today to arrive, and whenever I read this letter this morning and got to the bottom, I was sorely disappointed.
[02:17:47.079 --> 02:17:51.861]  Yeah, well let me just say this, and I appreciate your call, but let me try to explain something here.
[02:17:53.662 --> 02:17:54.783]  We brought you Willie Nelson.
[02:17:55.003 --> 02:17:56.143]  We brought you Jesse Ventura.
[02:17:56.223 --> 02:17:58.084]  They went public for 9-11 Truth here on the air.
[02:17:58.925 --> 02:18:00.786]  In music, doesn't really get bigger than Willie Nelson.
[02:18:00.806 --> 02:18:03.847]  He's in the top three or four most popular people out there that are still alive.
[02:18:04.427 --> 02:18:05.688]  Right up there at Bob Dylan level.
[02:18:06.428 --> 02:18:07.249]  Mick Jagger level.
[02:18:09.050 --> 02:18:10.831]  Johnny Cash level, but Johnny's not here.
[02:18:12.131 --> 02:18:13.272]  We brought you Charlie Sheen.
[02:18:13.912 --> 02:18:15.413]  And people poo-pooed that when it happened.
[02:18:17.264 --> 02:18:21.165]  I told you in the video yesterday that that was the start.
[02:18:22.386 --> 02:18:22.726]  Okay?
[02:18:23.286 --> 02:18:33.608]  The letter is written so that the media will pick it up and so that it isn't just a boring 20 points that it's about the meeting he wants to have with the president.
[02:18:34.128 --> 02:18:37.729]  And Charlie was showing his knowledge of how the president would respond in his propaganda.
[02:18:38.350 --> 02:18:39.910]  And it brought up the torture and everything else.
[02:18:41.570 --> 02:18:49.413]  And so, if you've got a better idea of how to get media attention and how to cause a massive awakening, please tell me.
[02:18:49.473 --> 02:18:51.214]  The letter is only the start.
[02:18:51.614 --> 02:18:52.574]  It's Charlie's idea.
[02:18:52.634 --> 02:18:53.555]  I think it's a great idea.
[02:18:55.855 --> 02:18:57.176]  The letter is only the start.
[02:18:57.836 --> 02:19:00.457]  Then there's the radio interviews and the video.
[02:19:01.017 --> 02:19:08.440]  And I told everybody in the piece, the video piece from yesterday that I played earlier, that there are going to be multiple things.
[02:19:08.460 --> 02:19:09.821]  There's more surprises.
[02:19:10.595 --> 02:19:11.796]  This is just the beginning.
[02:19:13.218 --> 02:19:15.520]  And it's kind of like, you know, anticlimactic.
[02:19:16.521 --> 02:19:20.345]  Where people are like, more, more, more.
[02:19:20.425 --> 02:19:23.248]  Charlie Sheen is coming out saying he wants to meet with the President.
[02:19:23.588 --> 02:19:24.830]  That's the big issue here.
[02:19:26.161 --> 02:19:27.021]  Have you seen the story?
[02:19:27.041 --> 02:19:29.682]  Charlie Sheen requests meeting with Obama over 9-1-1 cover-up.
[02:19:30.063 --> 02:19:35.705]  Actor demands investigation be reopened after majority of 9-11 commission members say government lied about official story.
[02:19:36.305 --> 02:19:38.866]  We are in the arena here with The Globalist.
[02:19:39.806 --> 02:19:41.187]  Did you see the New York Times article?
[02:19:42.067 --> 02:19:44.108]  Where they went after Mark Cuban, but he won?
[02:19:44.808 --> 02:19:45.588]  Or the White House?
[02:19:47.469 --> 02:19:48.249]  What's the headline on that?
[02:19:48.269 --> 02:19:49.210]  You guys printed it earlier?
[02:19:50.339 --> 02:19:52.201]  I mean, we told you they were threatening Mark Cuban.
[02:19:52.581 --> 02:19:54.923]  Here it is, insider trading or political persecution.
[02:19:55.183 --> 02:20:03.171]  Then it came out, White House emails, Securities and Exchange Commission calling him up, threatening him about, you better not make that 9-11 film or we're going to destroy you.
[02:20:04.052 --> 02:20:08.135]  And he pulled out of it and said, my God, but they still went and tried to prosecute him.
[02:20:08.376 --> 02:20:09.977]  And it came out in the New York Times.
[02:20:10.037 --> 02:20:12.299]  Show people the article that are watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:20:14.847 --> 02:20:16.549]  Charlie Sheen knows about all this.
[02:20:16.589 --> 02:20:18.933]  This is a guy who makes tens of millions of dollars a year.
[02:20:19.614 --> 02:20:21.676]  This is a guy who isn't just thinking about himself.
[02:20:22.558 --> 02:20:29.407]  And then people are lying, you know, some people, I don't, you know, I don't, you know, I wish it was a real meeting with the President.
[02:20:29.507 --> 02:20:30.568]  That's what this is about.
[02:20:31.499 --> 02:20:35.180]  When the media asked him, why'd you write this mock letter to the President?
[02:20:35.541 --> 02:20:37.001]  This is what the establishment does a lot.
[02:20:37.021 --> 02:20:38.142]  I don't know if people understand this.
[02:20:38.162 --> 02:20:45.965]  In fact, Google in print off for me, Gary Hart lettered to Iran, Huffington Post, and then we questioned him about it.
[02:20:46.005 --> 02:20:46.745]  It's in Truth Rising.
[02:20:47.605 --> 02:20:52.207]  And he said, my mock letter to them was a real letter.
[02:20:52.247 --> 02:20:53.348]  People said, well, this isn't a real letter.
[02:20:53.368 --> 02:20:53.768]  What do you mean?
[02:20:54.028 --> 02:20:54.548]  I published it.
[02:20:54.628 --> 02:20:55.148]  I sent it to him.
[02:20:55.168 --> 02:20:59.030]  You know, where he has this kind of conversation.
[02:20:59.878 --> 02:21:04.119]  And then, I mean, that's how you do this, is that you're saying you want this meeting to happen.
[02:21:04.139 --> 02:21:08.900]  There was a Washington Post article about a meeting with the President where Martin Sheen interviews the President or whatever.
[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:13.261]  Or it was an interview, like somebody was interviewing Sheen like he was the President in the Washington Post.
[02:21:13.281 --> 02:21:22.302]  The point is, is that it's done so that people will read it and see the 20 points and understand, my God, what would happen if the President did see this?
[02:21:22.743 --> 02:21:24.063]  What would happen if people did that?
[02:21:24.483 --> 02:21:24.783]  Okay?
[02:21:25.163 --> 02:21:26.203]  So we're in the arena.
[02:21:26.803 --> 02:21:28.284]  And regardless, nothing's perfect.
[02:21:29.964 --> 02:21:33.205]  We're asking you to now go out for 9-11 Truth.
[02:21:33.225 --> 02:21:34.926]  Okay, that's the big issue.
[02:21:34.986 --> 02:21:36.027]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:21:36.367 --> 02:21:37.727]  That's what we're discussing here.
[02:21:37.787 --> 02:21:38.848]  That's what we're covering here.
[02:21:39.368 --> 02:21:42.489]  And Charlie and I busted our butt putting this letter together.
[02:21:42.509 --> 02:21:43.930]  Charlie did 90% of the work on that.
[02:21:44.430 --> 02:21:44.730]  Okay?
[02:21:47.151 --> 02:21:48.692]  So, we need to get this out to everybody.
[02:21:48.712 --> 02:21:50.013]  God bless you.
[02:21:50.833 --> 02:21:51.733]  We're on the march.
[02:21:52.234 --> 02:21:53.814]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:21:54.775 --> 02:21:57.436]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:04.214]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:22:04.474 --> 02:22:06.256]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:22:06.476 --> 02:22:14.764]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:22:15.005 --> 02:22:20.230]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:22.172]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:22:22.412 --> 02:22:28.734]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:22:28.914 --> 02:22:39.676]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:22:39.976 --> 02:22:40.476]  That's right.
[02:22:40.737 --> 02:22:43.057]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:22:43.297 --> 02:22:44.878]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[02:22:46.818 --> 02:22:47.459]  We're good to go.
[02:23:00.669 --> 02:23:02.350]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:06.112]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:23:06.292 --> 02:23:08.153]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:23:08.433 --> 02:23:11.515]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:23:11.815 --> 02:23:17.339]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:23:17.599 --> 02:23:21.541]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:23:21.881 --> 02:23:26.804]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[02:24:00.584 --> 02:24:05.267]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[02:24:05.468 --> 02:24:07.890]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[02:24:08.050 --> 02:24:10.952]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life.
[02:24:11.152 --> 02:24:17.575]  That even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[02:24:17.715 --> 02:24:23.597]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[02:24:23.898 --> 02:24:26.399]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[02:24:26.599 --> 02:24:36.303]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[02:24:36.323 --> 02:24:37.003]  I think so.
[02:25:07.662 --> 02:25:14.286]  Ladies and gentlemen, the big news is that Charlie Sheen is going on the show Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[02:25:14.566 --> 02:25:19.068]  That he is asking for a meeting with President Barack Obama.
[02:25:19.108 --> 02:25:25.412]  The 20 minutes with the President is a way to make it interesting for people to read it and envision what that meeting would be like.
[02:25:25.452 --> 02:25:32.916]  And Jaron, one of the producers here who also helps run the show with Paul Hartman in there, Jaron Neihart, just real fast during the break,
[02:25:34.497 --> 02:25:36.379]  He really crystallized it.
[02:25:36.419 --> 02:25:37.080]  Repeat what you said.
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:43.467]  Yeah, well, I was talking about because that last caller, what he had said, he was disappointed after he got to the end of that piece.
[02:25:43.527 --> 02:25:46.651]  And I was suggesting this morning, I read it for the first time.
[02:25:46.671 --> 02:25:48.573]  I didn't have any idea what it was about.
[02:25:48.653 --> 02:25:55.201]  But the beauty of that piece to me was that as you were reading it, you could visualize the meeting.
[02:25:55.919 --> 02:25:59.161]  And while you're reading that piece, you get the evidence.
[02:25:59.221 --> 02:26:03.023]  You see the evidence presented to Obama as you're visualizing it.
[02:26:04.744 --> 02:26:05.724]  That's what Charlie said to me.
[02:26:05.744 --> 02:26:11.147]  He said, I have an idea, like a letter to the president, but like it's a meeting, visualizing a meeting I really want to have.
[02:26:11.427 --> 02:26:14.669]  And that's only a platform when the media ask him to say, yeah, I really want this meeting.
[02:26:15.229 --> 02:26:16.230]  These are the facts.
[02:26:16.430 --> 02:26:24.314]  Because you can't get people to read a 16 page report of bullet points and links, but they will read it if it's in the context of something interesting.
[02:26:24.594 --> 02:26:26.835]  Yeah, it was theater of the mind, basically.
[02:26:27.076 --> 02:26:32.479]  As I was reading that, I really felt like I was looking in on that meeting, and then I saw the evidence presented.
[02:26:33.139 --> 02:26:37.282]  He mentioned the painstaking research that was done for what he was presenting.
[02:26:37.302 --> 02:26:40.364]  And then he gives him the folders, and you have the links to those folders.
[02:26:40.464 --> 02:26:40.904]  Exactly.
[02:26:41.465 --> 02:26:44.847]  And see, I hadn't really articulated that yet today, but that's exactly what Charlie said.
[02:26:44.867 --> 02:26:48.009]  So when you said it, I was like, that's exactly what Charlie's idea was.
[02:26:48.049 --> 02:26:51.011]  But that's only the platform to get the real meeting.
[02:26:52.227 --> 02:26:55.628]  We want people to call the White House and say, Obama, don't run from Charlie Sheen, meet with him.
[02:26:55.869 --> 02:26:58.410]  But then other people can meet with their politicians.
[02:26:59.270 --> 02:27:00.651]  And that's what he's calling for in this.
[02:27:00.971 --> 02:27:01.431]  Absolutely.
[02:27:02.211 --> 02:27:03.112]  Jaren, thank you so much.
[02:27:03.132 --> 02:27:03.612]  No problem, man.
[02:27:04.352 --> 02:27:10.795]  All right, I want to continue with some of your phone calls and then recap some of the other top news stories and read some of the 20 bullet points.
[02:27:10.835 --> 02:27:18.338]  In fact, before I run out of time, we're going to go to Matthew, Gary, Steve, Michael, Michelle, and others here in just a few minutes.
[02:27:18.358 --> 02:27:20.639]  But I want to read from 20 minutes with the President.
[02:27:22.318 --> 02:27:32.463]  I want to read some of the 20 bullet points that Charlie Sheen would like to make to the President in person.
[02:27:34.463 --> 02:27:36.304]  Okay, so it says, Thank you, Mr. President.
[02:27:36.384 --> 02:27:42.887]  Okay, first, on the FBI Most Wanted list, Osama Bin Laden is not charged or enlisted with the crimes of 9-11.
[02:27:42.907 --> 02:27:48.710]  When I called the FBI to ask them why this was the case, they replied, there's not enough evidence to link Bin Laden to the crime scene.
[02:27:49.795 --> 02:27:50.155]  I don't think so.
[02:28:03.181 --> 02:28:04.022]  Bombings in Kenya.
[02:28:04.722 --> 02:28:05.943]  Bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
[02:28:06.564 --> 02:28:08.145]  And, of course, for the USS Cole.
[02:28:08.645 --> 02:28:10.747]  And we have links to the FBI's own admissions.
[02:28:11.327 --> 02:28:21.915]  Number two, FBI translator Sybil Edmonds was dismissed and gagged by the DOJ after she revealed the government had foreknowledge of the plans to attack American cities using planes as bombs as early as April 2001.
[02:28:22.555 --> 02:28:24.737]  Remember, Bush lied and said that wasn't the case, but later it came out.
[02:28:25.257 --> 02:28:30.381]  In August of 2009, Mrs. Edmonds broke the federal gag order and testified under oath
[02:28:31.101 --> 02:28:37.666]  That Osama Bin Laden, Al-Qaeda and the Taliban were all working for and with the CIA up until the day of 9-11.
[02:28:37.946 --> 02:28:48.153]  Number three, the following is a quote from Mayor Giuliani during an interview on 9-1-1 with Peter Jennings for ABC News.
[02:28:48.733 --> 02:28:54.137]  I went down to the scene and we set up a headquarters at 75 Barkley Street, I'm quoting
[02:28:55.856 --> 02:28:56.496]  Mayor Giuliani.
[02:28:57.517 --> 02:29:10.461]  Quote, I went down to the scene and we set up headquarters at 75 Barkley Street, which was right there with the police commissioner, the fire commissioner, the head of emergency management, and we were operating out of there when we were told that the World Trade Center was going to collapse.
[02:29:10.541 --> 02:29:14.763]  And it did collapse before we could actually get out of the building.
[02:29:15.243 --> 02:29:22.265]  So we were trapped in the building for 10 or 15 minutes and finally found an exit and got out and walked north and took a lot of people with us.
[02:29:22.745 --> 02:29:23.486]  Who told him this?
[02:29:24.306 --> 02:29:31.972]  Charlie Sheen says, to this day, the question remains unanswered, completely ignored and emphatically denied by Mayor Giuliani on several public occasions.
[02:29:31.992 --> 02:29:37.477]  Even though there's all these videos and audios of him on ABC News and CBS saying the exact same thing.
[02:29:39.619 --> 02:29:40.259]  So there you have it.
[02:29:40.319 --> 02:29:41.540]  Number four, Charlie Sheen.
[02:29:42.821 --> 02:29:49.367]  Number four, in April 2004, USA Today reported, in the two years before September 11th, the North American Aero Defense Command
[02:29:51.104 --> 02:29:55.086]  Conducted exercises simulating what the White House says was unimaginable at the time.
[02:29:55.426 --> 02:29:59.668]  Hijacked airliners used as weapons to crash into targets and cause mass casualties.
[02:30:00.068 --> 02:30:01.429]  One of the targets was the World Trade Center.
[02:30:01.669 --> 02:30:02.749]  Charlie Sheen, number five.
[02:30:03.410 --> 02:30:15.135]  On September 12, 2007, CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 reported that the mysterious white plane spotted in videotape by multiple media outlets flying in restricted airspace over the White House shortly before 10 a.m.
[02:30:15.415 --> 02:30:17.996]  on the morning of 9-11 was in fact the Air Force's E-4B.
[02:30:19.614 --> 02:30:26.179]  A specially modified Boeing 747 with a communications pod behind the cockpit, otherwise known as the Doomsday Plane.
[02:30:26.539 --> 02:30:27.820]  And there's links to all these reports.
[02:30:28.541 --> 02:30:31.243]  To Giuliani, to CNN, to Anderson Cooper.
[02:30:32.864 --> 02:30:42.592]  Though fully aware of the event, the 9-11 Commission deemed the appearance of the military plane to not be of any interest and did not include it in the final 9-11 Commission report.
[02:30:42.952 --> 02:30:44.433]  By the way, it was over D.C.
[02:30:44.553 --> 02:30:45.114]  and New York.
[02:30:45.634 --> 02:30:46.495]  They got five of them.
[02:30:47.995 --> 02:30:49.155]  When all other planes are grounded.
[02:30:49.796 --> 02:31:00.940]  Number six, three F-16s assigned to Andrews Air Force Base, 10 miles from D.C., were conducting training exercises in North Carolina, 207 miles away, as the first planes crashed into the World Trade Center.
[02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:12.684]  Even at significantly less than their top speeds of 1,500 miles per hour, they could still have defended the skies over Washington well before 9 a.m., more than 37 minutes before Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon.
[02:31:12.724 --> 02:31:15.265]  However, they did not return until after 9.55 a.m.
[02:31:17.046 --> 02:31:21.587]  Andrews Air Force Base had no armed fighters on alert and ready to take off on that morning of 9-11.
[02:31:22.307 --> 02:31:27.428]  Charlie Sheen, number 7, WTC Building 7.
[02:31:28.089 --> 02:31:30.089]  Watch the video of its collapse.
[02:31:30.129 --> 02:31:31.769]  We have a link to that and a whole page on that.
[02:31:32.670 --> 02:31:37.571]  Number 8, Flight 93 is the fourth plane to crash on 9-11 at 10-03 a.m.
[02:31:37.611 --> 02:31:38.491]  Vice President Cheney,
[02:31:40.114 --> 02:31:43.716]  Only give shoot down orders at 10 10 to 10 20 a.m.
[02:31:43.876 --> 02:31:48.339]  and this is not communicated to NORAD until 28 minutes after flight 93 crashes.
[02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:59.586]  Further fueling suspicion on this front is the fact that three months before the 9-11 attacks Dick Cheney usurped control of NORAD and therefore he and no one else on planet Earth had the power
[02:32:00.899 --> 02:32:04.923]  To call for military sorties on the hijacked airliners on 9-11.
[02:32:05.223 --> 02:32:06.784]  He did not exercise that power.
[02:32:06.824 --> 02:32:11.088]  Three months after 9-11, he relinquished command of NORAD and returned it to military operation.
[02:32:11.949 --> 02:32:15.292]  And then we have links to that.
[02:32:15.312 --> 02:32:17.274]  Hold on one second, I gotta take this phone call.
[02:32:17.294 --> 02:32:20.037]  Hey my friend, I'm on the air.
[02:32:22.359 --> 02:32:22.539]  Hey.
[02:32:25.069 --> 02:32:25.929]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:32:25.969 --> 02:32:26.430]  We're talking.
[02:32:26.470 --> 02:32:27.710]  Hey, I'll tell you what, guys.
[02:32:27.730 --> 02:32:28.911]  I'm going to talk to Charlie.
[02:32:28.931 --> 02:32:30.131]  I know this is an important call.
[02:32:31.032 --> 02:32:34.814]  Go to the older interview for just a minute or two, okay?
[02:32:34.834 --> 02:32:35.554]  I'll be right back, folks.
[02:32:38.465 --> 02:32:41.887]  Charlie, there's so many facets to 9-11, but what about WTC7?
[02:32:43.068 --> 02:32:44.969]  I mean, it wasn't even hit by a building.
[02:32:44.989 --> 02:32:48.051]  47-story structure, has two small fires in it.
[02:32:48.672 --> 02:32:51.473]  A modern steel building, it never collapsed from fire.
[02:32:51.914 --> 02:32:58.078]  The Madrid fire last year, it burned for two days with 150-something foot white-hot flames, and nothing collapsed there.
[02:32:58.458 --> 02:33:00.059]  What happened with Building 7, in your opinion?
[02:33:00.699 --> 02:33:01.540]  Well, curious, isn't it?
[02:33:02.594 --> 02:33:04.055]  It's a little bit curious.
[02:33:04.075 --> 02:33:19.280]  It just seems odd that an event, something that we all witness, because September 11th wasn't the Zapruder Film, it was the Zapruder Film Festival, okay?
[02:33:19.940 --> 02:33:21.561]  And I think that
[02:33:23.385 --> 02:33:30.731]  What was the great Hoover quote about the bigger the lie, the easier it is to pass over on people?
[02:33:30.971 --> 02:33:31.231]  Yes.
[02:33:31.891 --> 02:33:33.112]  I mangled it.
[02:33:33.172 --> 02:33:33.893]  I'm paraphrasing.
[02:33:33.913 --> 02:33:36.855]  Hitler had a similar one about the bigger the lie, the more they'll buy it.
[02:33:37.316 --> 02:33:37.536]  Sure.
[02:33:37.636 --> 02:33:38.156]  There you go.
[02:33:38.176 --> 02:33:45.242]  Let me just throw out a quote just because we're 20 minutes into this and I'm sure I'm being demonized across the nation.
[02:33:46.182 --> 02:33:50.125]  You know, all of the people that do that sort of thing.
[02:33:50.145 --> 02:33:53.968]  But people see through the propaganda organs now like they never have before.
[02:33:53.988 --> 02:33:54.809]  Well, good.
[02:33:55.269 --> 02:33:56.110]  Good, finally.
[02:33:57.131 --> 02:33:58.152]  There's a couple of quotes here.
[02:33:59.213 --> 02:34:05.317]  The first is, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the President or anyone else.
[02:34:06.118 --> 02:34:08.100]  The second quote from the same gentleman is,
[02:34:09.335 --> 02:34:16.617]  That we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.
[02:34:17.098 --> 02:34:17.858]  Theodore Roosevelt.
[02:34:18.318 --> 02:34:20.299]  Yes, well that's what the Founding Fathers said.
[02:34:20.339 --> 02:34:21.859]  It's our job to be watchdogs.
[02:34:21.879 --> 02:34:26.321]  The Declaration of Independence clearly states that in our seminal founding document.
[02:34:27.261 --> 02:34:27.701]  Absolutely.
[02:34:28.157 --> 02:34:34.542]  Yeah, and we've been coerced away from these founding principles.
[02:34:34.702 --> 02:34:42.609]  We've been told you're either with us or you're with the terrorists, and we've been told never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning 9-11.
[02:34:42.649 --> 02:34:43.990]  Bush said that at the U.N.
[02:34:44.450 --> 02:34:44.851]  Yes, he did.
[02:34:45.504 --> 02:34:45.985]  Yes, he did.
[02:34:46.125 --> 02:34:50.129]  That would direct the blame away from those responsible, blah, blah, blah.
[02:34:51.411 --> 02:34:53.493]  Back to Building 7, yeah.
[02:34:53.674 --> 02:35:04.025]  You pointed out in one of your documentaries that in a classic controlled demolition that they create what's first called a crease, is that correct?
[02:35:04.246 --> 02:35:05.067]  Or a wrinkle?
[02:35:06.088 --> 02:35:08.890]  Crease, wrinkle, crimp, all those are used, yes.
[02:35:08.910 --> 02:35:10.070]  They blow the central column.
[02:35:10.571 --> 02:35:16.755]  Right, and the term pull is about pulling the outer walls toward the center of the building, correct?
[02:35:16.875 --> 02:35:17.135]  Yes.
[02:35:18.897 --> 02:35:23.380]  So you minimize the damage, and that way you bring a building down on its own footprint.
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:24.820]  Correct.
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:29.242]  And many controlled demolition experts said they've never seen a prettier job than Building 7.
[02:35:29.282 --> 02:35:30.543]  Yeah, gosh.
[02:35:30.743 --> 02:35:42.828]  And there was a guy, I can't remember his name, but scientifically he broke down that the building actually fell faster than the speed of gravity because of the explosive vacuum that was created.
[02:35:43.468 --> 02:35:56.316]  Well, a lot of different physicists, a physics professor at BYU, Stephen Jones has done that, underwriting laboratories, Kevin Ryan, who was the... That guy got fired, right?
[02:35:56.516 --> 02:36:06.122]  Yes, he said, we did our own test and it's impossible, steel doesn't melt until thousands of degrees, around 3,000 it weakens, and jet fuel burns at 1,200 to 1,400, it's impossible.
[02:36:06.563 --> 02:36:09.405]  Well, that's 1,200 at optimum conditions, right?
[02:36:09.825 --> 02:36:10.005]  Yes.
[02:36:12.455 --> 02:36:20.400]  Yeah, and then you've got Silverstein, the leaseholder, the owner of 7 as well as the rest of the complex, right?
[02:36:21.841 --> 02:36:30.587]  On tape, on the record, saying we've had such a terrible loss of life that day and I made the decision that they should go ahead and pull it.
[02:36:30.827 --> 02:36:32.668]  And we gave the order and watched the building come down.
[02:36:33.068 --> 02:36:33.328]  Yeah.
[02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:41.392]  The pull is, I mean, that's as common to the demo world as action and cut to the movie world.
[02:36:41.432 --> 02:36:49.614]  Here is Larry Silverstein, the owner who took out $7 billion of insurance on the two towers, and he's also now bought the Sears Tower and taken out a bunch of insurance.
[02:36:51.014 --> 02:36:57.716]  Governor Pataki just called him the lowest of the low in the newspaper because he's holding out for a billion more now.
[02:36:58.116 --> 02:37:03.878]  Interesting fellow, made out quite well, and here is his statement from America Rebuilds.
[02:37:04.618 --> 02:37:10.840]  I remember getting a call from the fight-upon-commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[02:37:12.441 --> 02:37:14.622]  I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[02:37:14.702 --> 02:37:17.443]  Maybe this one has something to do with this pull.
[02:37:18.823 --> 02:37:23.905]  And they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.
[02:37:24.285 --> 02:37:26.566]  They made the decision to pull.
[02:37:27.086 --> 02:37:27.766]  They made.
[02:37:28.347 --> 02:37:29.527]  They made the decision.
[02:37:30.243 --> 02:37:46.715]  And this building with two small fires implodes perfectly, and then there's video from every angle of the squibs, or the blast points, where the plastic explosives are detonating, and you see the ejection ports, you see the blast points, just like when you watch a Las Vegas demolition.
[02:37:46.936 --> 02:37:49.297]  They just had a demolition over the weekend in Fort Worth.
[02:37:49.317 --> 02:37:52.219]  We have video and photos of that up on InfoWars.com.
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:53.220]  Fell just like seven.
[02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:54.021]  The blast,
[02:37:54.461 --> 02:38:00.886]  The squibs, then the crimp in the middle, the top of the building imploding downwards, and then it falls in on itself.
[02:38:02.067 --> 02:38:07.372]  Going back to our guest, Mr. Sheen, that is the clip you mentioned with Mr. Silverstein.
[02:38:08.052 --> 02:38:09.573]  Okay, that's the interview from three years ago.
[02:38:09.634 --> 02:38:17.340]  We've aired a clip of an interview we're going to be airing in full tomorrow and Charlie Sheen live coming up several times this week and a video interview.
[02:38:17.820 --> 02:38:21.063]  Again, repeat the big announced news story.
[02:38:22.637 --> 02:38:24.462]  So I've gotten emails and calls, there's some confusion.
[02:38:24.642 --> 02:38:26.908]  Is it just the letter to the President?
[02:38:27.682 --> 02:38:51.681]  The simulated letter of Charlie meeting with the President, it's him asking for a real meeting and asking people to get politically active and asking people to go out to the Tea Parties and the events in the town halls and bring up 9-11 and the fact that six of the ten commissioners, the media, the establishment, the George Soros liberals, the neocons, the left-right control paradigm, they're going to try to make it about a whole bunch of other issues.
[02:38:51.721 --> 02:38:52.322]  And we knew that!
[02:38:52.622 --> 02:38:53.063]  That's good!
[02:38:53.908 --> 02:38:56.750]  We want people to, you know, run around ruffling their feathers.
[02:38:56.790 --> 02:39:01.513]  And when the media asked Charlie Sheen, well, why'd you write this letter, you know, as if you'd met with the president?
[02:39:01.833 --> 02:39:07.536]  Well, that's the whole point of it, is he wants to meet with the president and he wants people to look at the evidence that we were just going over.
[02:39:08.237 --> 02:39:09.377]  That's the whole point of this.
[02:39:09.397 --> 02:39:10.178]  That's the whole point.
[02:39:11.479 --> 02:39:13.740]  I mean, it just, sometimes it makes my head spin.
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:20.363]  But the big news is Charlie Sheen is going public for 9-11 Truth in a much bigger way than he did three years ago.
[02:39:20.383 --> 02:39:24.145]  And he's asking for other prominent people to go public for 9-11 Truth.
[02:39:24.185 --> 02:39:26.206]  So, we're asking everybody to get this out to the media.
[02:39:26.226 --> 02:39:28.828]  Of course, there's going to be a lot of alternative media that's jealous.
[02:39:28.968 --> 02:39:31.789]  I don't know why they are so obsessed with us.
[02:39:31.929 --> 02:39:33.270]  It's because we're successful.
[02:39:33.650 --> 02:39:39.413]  But we're successful because our heart's in the right place about reaching out to the people and showing people the power they have.
[02:39:39.853 --> 02:39:48.858]  You know, I get criticized for saying we need to have states' rights and not secede, though that's in the Constitution of the states, choose, but to just re-declare 10th Amendment sovereignty.
[02:39:49.258 --> 02:39:54.000]  Or I get criticized a month ago for telling people to go to these town halls and take them over.
[02:39:54.180 --> 02:39:54.801]  People did that.
[02:39:55.201 --> 02:39:56.362]  It's the power of the people.
[02:39:56.422 --> 02:39:57.682]  It's peaceful revolution.
[02:39:57.982 --> 02:40:00.344]  Of course they're going to have COINTELPRO criticizing us for this.
[02:40:01.664 --> 02:40:05.886]  This is a whole nother level of resistance in waking people up.
[02:40:05.946 --> 02:40:07.787]  This is massive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:07.807 --> 02:40:08.608]  This is huge.
[02:40:10.523 --> 02:40:12.325]  Let's jam in more phone calls as promised.
[02:40:12.686 --> 02:40:16.029]  Let's go ahead and talk to, who's up next here in order?
[02:40:17.651 --> 02:40:18.833]  Matthew in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:40:19.974 --> 02:40:20.755]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:40:20.975 --> 02:40:25.500]  I'm a member of We Are Change National and I've been trying to get Not Livin' Truth out the best I can.
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:30.346]  I actually had a local theater rented out to show Pablo Lemonade Tuesday and they backed out last minute.
[02:40:30.962 --> 02:40:31.362]  I've got it.
[02:40:31.382 --> 02:40:32.783]  So there you go, the censorship.
[02:40:32.823 --> 02:40:37.185]  You're trying to show fabled enemies, well I guess today, and they backed out.
[02:40:37.205 --> 02:40:41.787]  That's what I mean, is that this is huge for 9-11 Truth.
[02:40:41.827 --> 02:40:42.707]  This is massive.
[02:40:43.027 --> 02:40:44.488]  The establishment is scared of this.
[02:40:45.268 --> 02:40:48.850]  I walked in there with $600 to file up a deal and they said, no, I'm sorry, we can't do this.
[02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:50.351]  This is too controversial right now.
[02:40:51.567 --> 02:40:52.148]  That's right.
[02:40:52.188 --> 02:40:58.072]  In America, you can't rent a theater and show how the 9-11 first responders are dying and aren't getting medical care.
[02:40:58.092 --> 02:40:59.893]  That's mainly what the film's about.
[02:41:00.274 --> 02:41:06.438]  You can't show New York police coming up and saying backpacks and cameras are guns and we're going to charge you with terrorism as 9-11 truthers.
[02:41:06.698 --> 02:41:09.160]  You can't show the police state for what it is.
[02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:15.925]  And remember how I got criticized two years ago saying in the trials the human papilloma, Gardasil vaccine was killing people?
[02:41:16.983 --> 02:41:19.985]  As if I wouldn't be sued off the face of the earth by Merck if that wasn't true.
[02:41:20.425 --> 02:41:21.446]  I had mainstream news.
[02:41:22.066 --> 02:41:28.870]  And then now, they're saying in England, they're going to take your kids, if your kids get hurt by it, and you speak out against it.
[02:41:29.711 --> 02:41:30.331]  Anything else, sir?
[02:41:31.132 --> 02:41:31.452]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:31.472 --> 02:41:33.673]  I've got, actually, I put together an event tomorrow night.
[02:41:33.873 --> 02:41:36.415]  It's at 8 o'clock at 1318 Little Hamilton.
[02:41:36.895 --> 02:41:39.417]  It's a National 37205 at 8 o'clock.
[02:41:39.457 --> 02:41:42.378]  We're going to have a 9-11 troop meeting and discussion and we're showing pampled enemies.
[02:41:42.899 --> 02:41:43.219]  Good.
[02:41:43.259 --> 02:41:43.859]  God bless you.
[02:41:43.879 --> 02:41:44.720]  Fire out a website.
[02:41:45.595 --> 02:41:46.155]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:47.036 --> 02:41:48.296]  WeAreChangeNashville.com.
[02:41:48.877 --> 02:41:50.217]  WeAreChangeNashville.com.
[02:41:50.257 --> 02:41:50.597]  Thank you.
[02:41:51.038 --> 02:41:51.598]  Yeah, look at this.
[02:41:51.938 --> 02:41:53.759]  Question a doctor, lose your child.
[02:41:54.059 --> 02:42:00.482]  Parents are being threatened with having their children taken away into care after questioning doctors' diagnoses or objecting to their medical care.
[02:42:00.882 --> 02:42:11.187]  John Hemming, a liberal Democrat MP who campaigns to stop injustice in the family court, said, very often proceedings are used for retaliation by local authorities against uppity people.
[02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:23.825]  The mother of a 13-year-old girl who became partially paralyzed after being given the cervical cancer vaccination says social workers have told her the child may be removed if the mother continues to link her condition to the vaccination, even though it's admitted.
[02:42:24.085 --> 02:42:33.309]  My wife had NPR on yesterday morning, cooking breakfast, and they were going, oh, it's a really good shot, but it does kill you or hurts you sometimes, so you should be aware of that.
[02:42:34.505 --> 02:42:39.988]  I mean, they're going to take your kids if you go give them the shot and they get paralyzed or die?
[02:42:40.008 --> 02:42:42.869]  I mean, you know, we're the conspiracy theorists.
[02:42:42.889 --> 02:42:47.831]  They're openly announcing Bank of the World, end of the dollar, total police state, gold above $1,000.
[02:42:47.871 --> 02:42:50.873]  I mean, we're just here covering real issues.
[02:42:51.413 --> 02:42:57.036]  And again, the fact that we're attacked by the establishment shows that we're over the target.
[02:42:57.516 --> 02:42:59.017]  Shows we're actually hitting them hard.
[02:42:59.037 --> 02:42:59.837]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:43:04.830 --> 02:43:05.271]  Let's go.
[02:43:24.275 --> 02:43:31.878]  With the extensive knowledge gained from the seven items in the whole enchilada package, which include books, cards, and video, as well as two free gifts.
[02:43:32.298 --> 02:43:38.501]  Now, I'd love to say this resource will always be available as your safety net, but in a national emergency, that may just not be true.
[02:43:38.941 --> 02:43:39.941]  And now it's on sale!
[02:43:39.981 --> 02:43:43.283]  That's right, until September 14th, everything is 10% off.
[02:43:43.663 --> 02:43:49.945]  So go to our website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of this offer before September 14th, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:43:52.126 --> 02:43:59.091]  That's ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE for the easiest and cheapest food backup plan.
[02:43:59.211 --> 02:43:59.791]  Do it now!
[02:44:01.353 --> 02:44:06.676]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:44:07.397 --> 02:44:12.740]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:44:13.281 --> 02:44:19.425]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:44:19.745 --> 02:44:21.586]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:44:21.726 --> 02:44:24.107]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:44:24.187 --> 02:44:35.131]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:44:37.371 --> 02:44:38.652]  It's not about left or right.
[02:44:39.052 --> 02:44:40.433]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:44:40.893 --> 02:44:47.135]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:46:03.485 --> 02:46:06.229]  Alright, final segment.
[02:46:07.011 --> 02:46:08.994]  Full interview with Charlie Sheen coming up tomorrow.
[02:46:09.114 --> 02:46:11.858]  Video interview on Thursday.
[02:46:12.238 --> 02:46:14.221]  Live on air with us on Friday.
[02:46:17.591 --> 02:46:29.374]  I want to take a call or two here at the very end, and again, as the show restarts at Infowars.com streaming, or here on Hammond Evans in your area, you'll get to hear me break down the whole Charlie Sheen situation coming up and why it's so important.
[02:46:29.394 --> 02:46:32.774]  But I'm asking people to get really politically active on this.
[02:46:32.814 --> 02:46:34.095]  He's asking you to get active.
[02:46:34.755 --> 02:46:37.835]  And he's asking you to call the White House and tell Obama he really wants to meet with him.
[02:46:37.875 --> 02:46:39.836]  That's the whole point of this.
[02:46:41.277 --> 02:46:46.141]  The article, ladies and gentlemen, where it talks about Charlie Sheen wanting to meet with the President.
[02:46:46.262 --> 02:46:49.685]  One sponsor that made today's show possible is Dejanet.net.
[02:46:49.765 --> 02:46:53.188]  D-E-J-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:46:53.508 --> 02:46:57.051]  They've got in-car little hidden camera systems that go to little memory sticks.
[02:46:57.152 --> 02:46:59.574]  Very affordable, very easy to install.
[02:46:59.854 --> 02:47:03.778]  They have little video, audio pins that have a camera hidden in them.
[02:47:04.807 --> 02:47:05.627]  That I've bought before for $150.
[02:47:05.667 --> 02:47:08.989]  They sell them for like $45 to $50 depending on how much memory you get.
[02:47:09.670 --> 02:47:20.436]  A whole bunch of great stuff at Diginet.net and it's great to keep in your car, great to always have on you, great to have a record of this with the establishment and the things they do.
[02:47:20.696 --> 02:47:21.916]  This is all admissible in court.
[02:47:22.216 --> 02:47:23.397]  Diginet.net.
[02:47:23.437 --> 02:47:25.018]  That's Diginet.net.
[02:47:26.459 --> 02:47:28.200]  Let's take a final call here.
[02:47:29.468 --> 02:47:34.270]  Let's go ahead and speak with Michelle in Arizona, daughter at school, watching Obama.
[02:47:34.510 --> 02:47:42.073]  Now again, they were going to have in there Obama saying, help me, work with me, do this, you know, into the youth brigades, which they've openly introduced bills to do.
[02:47:42.413 --> 02:47:44.814]  Then they made it a milk test speech and said, oh, what's the big deal?
[02:47:45.275 --> 02:47:46.215]  Your comments, Michelle.
[02:47:48.096 --> 02:47:49.756]  First of all, I'm a big fan of yours.
[02:47:49.817 --> 02:47:51.197]  I just wanted to say that.
[02:47:51.437 --> 02:47:52.298]  Fan of you, ma'am.
[02:47:52.878 --> 02:47:53.718]  Yeah, I mean, 100%.
[02:47:53.938 --> 02:47:55.579]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[02:47:56.449 --> 02:48:05.551]  Anyhow, we've been going up and down this whole thing with Obama, and my daughter, I would rather her, if she's going to watch anything like that, watch it with me, not at school.
[02:48:06.411 --> 02:48:22.414]  And so she's maybe one of the three kids in the whole school that isn't watching it, and now I'm having, like I've had three different teachers call me, the office call me, and apparently there's some kind of problem because she's not watching it.
[02:48:22.987 --> 02:48:24.728]  Hold on a minute.
[02:48:25.028 --> 02:48:25.749]  Wait, wait, wait.
[02:48:26.189 --> 02:48:29.151]  You told them don't let my daughter watch that and they're making an issue out of it?
[02:48:29.871 --> 02:48:30.652]  Yes.
[02:48:30.812 --> 02:48:36.856]  I do not feel like, if my daughter does not feel comfortable, plus I feel more comfortable watching that with my daughter.
[02:48:36.976 --> 02:48:38.137]  Well, what are they saying to you?
[02:48:38.157 --> 02:48:40.899]  Because you want to write this up in a blurb, the name of the school.
[02:48:41.359 --> 02:48:42.320]  You don't have to use your name.
[02:48:42.420 --> 02:48:43.420]  Absolutely I would.
[02:48:43.540 --> 02:48:48.343]  I don't know, you know, I've been, um, just turned on you probably about four months ago.
[02:48:48.524 --> 02:48:52.146]  I've watched, ever since then, I've watched every single thing that you have put out.
[02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:55.862]  We'll send it to Riders at infowars.com.
[02:48:55.882 --> 02:48:58.023]  The name of the school, what's happening, we're almost out of time.
[02:48:58.284 --> 02:48:59.624]  We may have you back on tomorrow.
[02:49:00.005 --> 02:49:03.627]  Specifically, and other parents write to us, specifically what are they saying?
[02:49:03.867 --> 02:49:05.748]  Are they asking if you're racist?
[02:49:06.889 --> 02:49:08.170]  Well, maybe you can tell me afterwards.
[02:49:08.570 --> 02:49:12.392]  Well, it's just, she called me up crying from her actual classroom.
[02:49:12.973 --> 02:49:18.876]  Because I had, when I talked to her about it yesterday, you know, they had Memorial Day Off.
[02:49:19.897 --> 02:49:21.198]  So what is the school saying to you?
[02:49:22.441 --> 02:49:31.849]  Um, well, you know, okay, well I guess, you know, if that's how you feel, but, you know, we don't know, I don't, it just, specifically, it's becoming a big problem.
[02:49:31.869 --> 02:49:35.873]  They make it a whole peer pressure thing, like she's an outcast, she's bad.
[02:49:36.093 --> 02:49:38.235]  No, this is meant to make the schools political.
[02:49:38.455 --> 02:49:39.937]  This is meant to divide people.
[02:49:40.817 --> 02:49:43.500]  Not to, not to cut you off, but I cut the teacher off.
[02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:48.304]  I just said, she doesn't feel comfortable watching it, I don't feel comfortable with her watching it.
[02:49:48.809 --> 02:49:49.691]  You know, that's it.
[02:49:49.831 --> 02:49:54.240]  So then the next thing I knew, I'm getting calls from the vice principal.
[02:49:54.681 --> 02:49:58.068]  And then the next thing I got was my daughter calling me up at lunch.
[02:49:58.660 --> 02:50:01.263]  Ma'am, give us your name and number off the air of the show's over.
[02:50:01.903 --> 02:50:02.404]  Write it up.
[02:50:02.484 --> 02:50:04.286]  Send it to writers at InfoWars.com.
[02:50:04.306 --> 02:50:05.787]  That's writers at InfoWars.com.
[02:50:06.128 --> 02:50:11.133]  News media that wants to get the details on the Charlie Sheen interview and minutes with the president.
[02:50:11.213 --> 02:50:11.593]  All of that.
[02:50:11.754 --> 02:50:13.495]  Sheen at InfoWars.com.
[02:50:13.515 --> 02:50:14.477]  Ma'am, we're going to put you on hold.
[02:50:14.497 --> 02:50:15.498]  Get your name and number right now.
[02:50:15.518 --> 02:50:17.640]  I want to hear what this principal said.
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:20.963]  See, this is the federal government getting involved in the schools.
[02:50:21.784 --> 02:50:22.944]  And they did all this deliberately.
[02:50:23.004 --> 02:50:23.725]  It's disgusting.
[02:50:24.085 --> 02:50:25.365]  And that's what we've got to expose.
[02:50:25.885 --> 02:50:27.065]  Back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:50:27.085 --> 02:50:27.666]  to 3 p.m.
[02:50:27.726 --> 02:50:28.586]  right here on Genesis.
[02:50:28.646 --> 02:50:35.028]  Retransmission starts now with all the latest developments on Charlie Sheen going public and asking for your help for 9-11 truth.
[02:50:35.128 --> 02:50:36.388]  He wants to meet with the President.
[02:50:36.788 --> 02:50:37.608]  God bless you all.
[02:50:42.050 --> 02:50:43.930]  You are listening to GCN.
