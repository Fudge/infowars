[00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.150]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.911]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:09.671]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.671 --> 00:00:11.271]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:12.192]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:16.993]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.993 --> 00:00:21.074]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:35.657]  It is Monday, the 14th day of September 2009.
[00:00:35.657 --> 00:00:41.822]  We're going to be live for the next four hours.
[00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:54.810]  And coming up in the next segment, I'll tell you about the guest we have on the show today.
[00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.754]  We have a very important radio show lined up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:17.092]  We are going to have open phones throughout the full four hours to discuss any news, any issues, any stories, local, national, international legislation.
[00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:29.161]  Obama right now is giving a speech from Wall Street calling for banking reform.
[00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:35.556]  And CNN and Fox, MSNBC, I scanned around the channels this morning.
[00:01:35.556 --> 00:01:48.483]  We're all following their talking points that we have to have a new special banking regulatory system run by the very same banks that engineered the collapse and the record profits they're making from it.
[00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.605]  We've got to have that or we could go into a depression.
[00:01:52.932 --> 00:02:03.699]  Just like the Great Depression, they're saying, first the stock market dipped, and then a year later it went back up and then dipped again into the nine-year full depression.
[00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:05.281]  So it's a repeat of a year ago.
[00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:14.327]  They're saying, give us more power now, the $23.7 trillion they've stolen so far in accounting, or we're going to have a depression.
[00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:27.809]  And then, if they're not given what they want in the next two, three months, with an expansion of control, they will badmouth the stock market and the economy again, and drive it down even further, and then get what they want.
[00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:34.334]  And use the implosion of the economy to consolidate power.
[00:02:34.334 --> 00:02:37.416]  So, that is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:37.416 --> 00:02:40.978]  I'm going to be breaking that down in some detail.
[00:02:40.978 --> 00:02:41.539]  And hopefully,
[00:02:42.984 --> 00:02:43.604]  You'll chime in.
[00:02:43.604 --> 00:02:44.745]  I want to comment on that subject.
[00:02:44.745 --> 00:03:03.613]  We also have all the big new developments with the flu, the fear-mongering accelerating there for the inoculations to begin in just 16 days or October 1st with the experimental vaccine linked to all the serious side effects that doesn't even protect you from all the different mutations of the H1N1.
[00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:08.396]  So I hope we'll discuss that.
[00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:21.842]  Also, the New York Times and CNN reporting that a few thousand people were at the tea parties when the Park Service and Homeland Security said two million.
[00:03:21.842 --> 00:03:24.503]  The quote is approaching two million.
[00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:26.444]  The Globe and Mail got that right.
[00:03:26.444 --> 00:03:29.165]  The Daily Mail got that right.
[00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:33.807]  But our controlled corporate press, of course, distorted that.
[00:03:35.043 --> 00:03:38.666]  But there is a riddle within that disinformation.
[00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:43.990]  Glenn Beck does deserve the credit as the leader of this.
[00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:51.376]  He certainly co-opted the massive resistance to the banker bailout takeover, even though he supported it enthusiastically.
[00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:56.200]  He certainly co-opted the movement.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.705]  And so, in an hour and a half, I have a special message, very special message,
[00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:11.209]  Public message to Glenn Beck and tonight or tomorrow, I'm not sure when, we're going to have a big report up on PrisonPlanet.com from Paul Watson.
[00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.072]  My message, my open letter to Glenn Beck.
[00:04:16.072 --> 00:04:19.954]  This is your last chance, Glenn, to not be a Benedict Arnold in history.
[00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:31.391]  I really want Glenn Beck to be for real, but he is definitely the most dangerous pundit on the left or right in the media.
[00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:35.894]  He is definitely following government scripts.
[00:04:35.894 --> 00:04:41.638]  If you want to know about somebody who's definitely spook run, it's Glenn Beck.
[00:04:41.638 --> 00:04:46.782]  And I want to explain to people how he's meant to lead the opposition right into the gates of hell.
[00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:49.904]  But I don't think Glenn Beck is an evil person.
[00:04:49.904 --> 00:04:50.926]  I think he's an actor.
[00:04:50.926 --> 00:04:53.450]  And you can look in his eyes.
[00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.614]  He is a very disturbed individual.
[00:04:55.614 --> 00:04:56.335]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:56.715]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:05.384]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:31.101]  We're good.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.743]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:06:02.743 --> 00:06:05.166]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:07.809]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:09.010]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.712]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:13.596]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:17.681]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:18.502]  Are you listening?
[00:06:26.862 --> 00:06:31.770]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.972]  How dare you?
[00:06:37.972 --> 00:06:43.055]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:43.055 --> 00:06:45.636]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:45.636 --> 00:06:51.420]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of violence.
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.400]  Truth Rising.

[00:06:57.523 --> 00:06:59.985]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:08.379]  Robert Beatle's new book, Here's What You Do, was written for anyone who wants to survive the upcoming and ongoing financial storm.

[00:07:51.976 --> 00:07:53.976]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:53.976 --> 00:07:55.117]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:27.116 --> 00:08:29.976]  We are going to take a lot of phone calls today.
[00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:35.537]  I had some guests scheduled, I cancelled them.
[00:08:35.537 --> 00:08:41.499]  Because I want to be able to spend time talking to you, the American people, and people from across the world.
[00:08:41.499 --> 00:08:43.319]  A toll-free number to join us on air.
[00:08:44.463 --> 00:08:46.783]  is 1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231 and we will get you up and on the air today.
[00:08:46.783 --> 00:08:50.664]  Okay, here are the issues if you just joined us and missed the first segment.
[00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:53.765]  We knew that on the agenda of the private offshore foreign banks
[00:09:10.407 --> 00:09:29.197]  We knew on the agenda was a corporate takeover, a corporate bankruptcy, putting the United States through fraud into a corporate bankruptcy to the very same private consortium of banks that own the private Federal Reserve that engineered the exotic derivatives bubble that popped it by design.
[00:09:29.197 --> 00:09:32.479]  We told you that two years before it happened from Bilderberg.
[00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:33.500]  It's in my film, Endgame.
[00:09:35.569 --> 00:09:42.552]  After they popped it by design, they terrorized and panicked the Congress into going along with the banking takeover.
[00:09:44.335 --> 00:09:53.681]  And then on their agenda for the fall and winter of 2009-2010 is establishing a new Bank of the World.
[00:09:53.681 --> 00:10:03.928]  And they have to get the western governments of the world from Japan, Germany, France, the Netherlands, England, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and others.
[00:10:03.928 --> 00:10:05.749]  Belgium, Luxembourg,
[00:10:07.705 --> 00:10:09.647]  The list goes on and on.
[00:10:09.647 --> 00:10:17.575]  To sign on to this new bank of the world that will set world tax rates, world interest rates, world currency rates.
[00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.317]  And it will selectively set them.
[00:10:19.317 --> 00:10:24.422]  The whole world will be a giant insider trading cash machine for the private interest.
[00:10:24.422 --> 00:10:29.166]  I mean, they already have that to a certain extent, but this will be total.
[00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:31.128]  They will hunt down the middle class's money.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.563]  Anybody who's got a million bucks and is offshore, they will hunt you down.
[00:10:35.563 --> 00:10:36.723]  They will take it.
[00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:38.865]  This is total vertical integration.
[00:10:38.865 --> 00:10:44.629]  This is a handful, you can count them on less than two hands, megabanks,
[00:10:46.787 --> 00:10:51.672]  Running around, gobbling up all the medium and small banks, insurance companies.
[00:10:51.672 --> 00:10:53.675]  And I was watching CNN this morning.
[00:10:53.675 --> 00:10:58.240]  They had their financial expert on there in a little pinstripe suit admitting this.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.283]  I mean, they're even throwing it in everyone's face.
[00:11:01.283 --> 00:11:04.707]  This is total economic warfare.
[00:11:04.707 --> 00:11:07.670]  We are being savagely conquered right now.
[00:11:10.024 --> 00:11:12.605]  And it's funny to Geithner.
[00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:15.266]  It's hilarious to Bernanke.
[00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:24.090]  They're laughing about it on television.
[00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:36.975]  Obama is giving a speech right now on CNN, calling, saying, we've done a great job saving you from what happened a year ago today with Lehman Brothers.
[00:11:38.254 --> 00:11:43.578]  And it'll truly be a year with the banking takeover October 3rd next month.
[00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:46.159]  So less than a month from now.
[00:11:46.159 --> 00:11:50.843]  What you're talking about 17, 18 days from now.
[00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:52.764]  In fact, let's just go to the commander-in-chief.
[00:11:52.764 --> 00:11:54.065]  Here he is.
[00:11:54.065 --> 00:11:59.649]  New rules to protect consumers and a new consumer financial protection agency to enforce those rules.
[00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:09.042]  Yeah, kind of like you and the Republicans changed it so they can have 30% interest rates on credit cards from 15.
[00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:10.423]  Oh yes, that's protecting everyone.
[00:12:10.423 --> 00:12:14.924]  It was not just the result of decisions made by the mightiest of financial firms.
[00:12:14.924 --> 00:12:21.445]  It was also the result of decisions made by ordinary Americans to open credit cards and take on mortgages.
[00:12:21.445 --> 00:12:31.947]  And while there were many who took out loans they knew they couldn't afford, there were also millions of Americans who signed contracts they didn't fully understand, offered by lenders who didn't always tell the truth.
[00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:39.372]  This is in part because there's no single agency charged with making sure that doesn't happen.
[00:12:39.372 --> 00:12:40.472]  That's what we intend to change.
[00:12:40.472 --> 00:12:51.236]  The Consumer Financial Protection Agency will have the power to make certain that consumers get information that is clear and concise, and to prevent the worst kinds of abuses.
[00:12:52.895 --> 00:12:59.896]  Consumers shouldn't have to worry about loan contracts designed to be unintelligible, hidden fees attached to their mortgage.
[00:12:59.896 --> 00:13:07.058]  That is the only reform they're really making in what they've been proposing, is that it will say at the top of the bill, you're paying 30%.
[00:13:07.058 --> 00:13:10.739]  But these people have no choice.
[00:13:10.739 --> 00:13:15.740]  So the argument is, yeah, we're going to tell you, slave, we're going to tell the sharecroppers how it works.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.860]  This guy is so sick.
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:22.001]  I have his moron supporters telling me that he's gotten the troops out of Iraq when he's actually increased the total number.
[00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:26.237]  With the contractors replacing him.
[00:13:26.237 --> 00:13:29.418]  They tell me that he was against the banker takeover and it was Bush.
[00:13:29.418 --> 00:13:31.238]  No, it was bipartisan.
[00:13:31.238 --> 00:13:35.759]  And that creature, Glenn Beck, got up there on his TV show and helped ram it through.
[00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:40.281]  And I have to sit here and watch him give speeches about the banks.
[00:13:40.281 --> 00:13:42.181]  And I have to watch Obama conning everybody.
[00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:43.141]  I'm so sick of it.
[00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:44.802]  I have a family.
[00:13:44.802 --> 00:13:47.043]  And I realize what bondage to these people means.
[00:13:47.043 --> 00:13:48.403]  It just makes me so sick.
[00:13:49.622 --> 00:13:51.182]  Can't America get smart?
[00:13:51.182 --> 00:13:52.623]  Can't you get wise?
[00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:55.404]  That Glenn Beck and Obama work for the same people?
[00:13:55.404 --> 00:13:57.064]  I mean, can't you do it?
[00:13:57.064 --> 00:13:59.405]  Fading back up!
[00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:02.846]  ...complex or the most confusing.
[00:14:02.846 --> 00:14:08.228]  Second, we've got to close the loopholes that were at the heart of the crisis.
[00:14:08.228 --> 00:14:12.609]  Where there were gaps in the rules, regulators lacked the authority to take action.
[00:14:13.663 --> 00:14:18.687]  Where there were overlaps, regulators often lacked accountability for inaction.
[00:14:18.687 --> 00:14:19.667]  Alright, fade it down.
[00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:29.774]  In Fall of the Republic we cover how they got rid of Brooksley Bourne, Bill Clinton did in 99.
[00:14:29.774 --> 00:14:33.857]  The lady who said we've got to restrict these derivatives.
[00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:41.403]  They got rid of her, put somebody in to totally get rid of the rules, and then block the Securities and Exchange Commission from being able to investigate it.
[00:14:42.355 --> 00:14:51.979]  And then we interview all the financial experts and show how Obama has now put the very people who replaced Brooksley Born, who ran the scam, in power.
[00:14:51.979 --> 00:15:01.342]  And they're actually taking all restrictions off derivatives, but they're not going to allow small guys to do it, only five big banks.
[00:15:01.342 --> 00:15:04.204]  I mean, these guys are going to gang-rape us bad, folks.
[00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:05.144]  They're going to hurt us bad.
[00:15:07.182 --> 00:15:23.133]  And they're just going to go on raping us, and on raping us, and this son of a bitch, he gets up there, that slick Harvard liar, and he just gets up there and lies to people, and he's going to hurt people so bad.
[00:15:23.133 --> 00:15:24.674]  Go back to the slick Harvard lawyer.
[00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:35.081]  ...that posed a systemic risk were not regulated as strongly as others, exploiting loopholes in the system to take on greater risk with less scrutiny.
[00:15:36.722 --> 00:15:40.516]  As a result, the failure of one firm threatened the viability of many others.
[00:15:41.618 --> 00:15:48.939]  We were facing one of the largest financial crises in history, and those responsible for oversight were caught off guard and without the authority to act.
[00:15:48.939 --> 00:15:52.080]  So we gave them 23.7 trillion and growing.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.980]  And more power.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.201]  And we're going to have the very guys that engineered it, they're going to create accountability.
[00:15:57.201 --> 00:16:09.483]  I.e., they're going to come, mafia shakedown any businesses or corporations they want, and in the new banking regulatory bills that they've introduced, that Obama tried to introduce a few months ago and he's reintroducing now,
[00:16:10.658 --> 00:16:16.323]  It allows them to regulate everything down to your business from a hot dog stand to a dry cleaners.
[00:16:16.323 --> 00:16:19.565]  Total economic dictatorship is now being proposed.
[00:16:19.565 --> 00:16:20.146]  Go back to him.
[00:16:20.998 --> 00:16:22.119]  We're good to go.
[00:16:45.552 --> 00:17:01.017]  Even as we've proposed safeguards to make the failure of large and interconnected firms less likely, we've also proposed creating what's called resolution authority in the event that such a failure happens and poses a threat to the stability of the financial system.
[00:17:01.017 --> 00:17:07.140]  This is intended to put an end to the idea that some firms are too big to fail.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:13.502]  For a market to function, those who invest and lend in that market must believe that their money is actually at risk.
[00:17:14.738 --> 00:17:21.721]  And the system as a whole isn't safe until it is safe from the failure of any individual institution.
[00:17:21.721 --> 00:17:22.641]  Oh yeah!
[00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:24.362]  You know what's really happened here?
[00:17:24.362 --> 00:17:28.784]  They've given him, and this number is two months old now.
[00:17:28.784 --> 00:17:35.007]  This number came out two months ago, ten months into the banker bailout, roughly.
[00:17:35.007 --> 00:17:36.688]  $23.7 trillion.
[00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:38.168]  It grows by $2 trillion a month.
[00:17:38.168 --> 00:17:43.311]  So, I don't know, add $2 trillion on $23.7 trillion, another $2 trillion.
[00:17:45.452 --> 00:17:56.478]  We're talking almost 28 trillion dollars, more than double the GDP, more than three times all the mortgages in the United States.
[00:17:56.478 --> 00:17:57.739]  All mortgages!
[00:17:57.739 --> 00:17:59.960]  Everything paid off!
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:10.166]  And he's up there telling you now that they're going to put an end to banker bailouts when
[00:18:12.188 --> 00:18:23.457]  What Obama is saying is they've given $23.7 trillion in growing to the very banks who went out and leveraged it in derivatives again.
[00:18:23.457 --> 00:18:24.358]  Just go back to him.
[00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:25.839]  We'll let Obama with his lies.
[00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:27.280]  Everything's a lie, a distortion.
[00:18:36.294 --> 00:18:43.516]  So our plan would put the cost of a firm's failures on those who own its stock and loaned it money.
[00:18:43.516 --> 00:18:53.939]  And if taxpayers ever have to step in again to prevent a second Great Depression, the financial industry will have to pay the taxpayer back every cent.
[00:18:53.939 --> 00:19:00.601]  Finally, we need to close the gaps that exist not just within this country, but among countries.
[00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:11.253]  The United States is leading a coordinated response to promote recovery and restore prosperity among both the world's largest economies and the world's fastest growing economies.
[00:19:12.398 --> 00:19:12.618]  All right.
[00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:14.759]  We'll get the transcript when he's done lying.
[00:19:14.759 --> 00:19:16.581]  I know most of you don't want to hear his voice.
[00:19:16.581 --> 00:19:19.402]  And we'll read over the lies coming up later, probably in the fourth hour.
[00:19:19.402 --> 00:19:21.764]  But I want to come back and just start going to your phone calls.
[00:19:38.334 --> 00:19:40.056]  Coming up, I'm going to break this down into detail.
[00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:42.678]  I'm going to get into what's happening in the real economy.
[00:19:42.678 --> 00:19:50.585]  We're going to challenge Glenn Beck to not be a Benedict Arnold in history so that his family, a hundred years from now, are ashamed of his name.
[00:19:50.585 --> 00:19:55.970]  We're going to get into the latest Charlie Sheen info, big attacks from Fox News and others.
[00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:56.510]  Stay with us.
[00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.332]  We'll be right back, InfoWars.com.

[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.321]  Good day.
[00:21:01.321 --> 00:21:02.962]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:03.382]  September 14, 2009.
[00:21:03.382 --> 00:21:04.643]  Gold opened this morning at $1,000.30.
[00:21:04.643 --> 00:21:08.446]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $10.28.47, $5.14.23 for the half ounce, or $2.57.12 for a quarter ounce.
[00:21:08.446 --> 00:21:08.887]  That's $10.28.47, $5.14.23, or $2.57.12.
[00:21:20.382 --> 00:21:34.009]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:21:34.009 --> 00:21:35.250]  Is this capitalism?
[00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:42.854]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:42.854 --> 00:21:43.935]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:48.077]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:21:48.297 --> 00:21:49.538]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:49.538 --> 00:21:54.202]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:21:54.202 --> 00:21:56.384]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.384 --> 00:22:00.708]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:02.710]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.333]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:08.455]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:22:08.455 --> 00:22:11.858]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:22:11.858 --> 00:22:13.760]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[00:22:14.173 --> 00:22:14.934]  We're good to go.
[00:22:39.309 --> 00:22:48.354]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library, my weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.

[00:23:01.092 --> 00:23:08.039]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Hunter safes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:10.902]  Graf Hunter safes are known as the Rolls Royce of safes.
[00:23:10.902 --> 00:23:15.527]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:20.032]  Whether it's a custom fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[00:23:20.032 --> 00:23:21.934]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[00:23:22.054 --> 00:23:22.554]  We're good to go.
[00:23:41.707 --> 00:23:42.248]  We're good to go.
[00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:32.237]  It was a failure of responsibility that led homebuyers and derivatives traders alike to take reckless risks that they couldn't afford to take.
[00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:44.066]  It was a collective failure of responsibility in Washington, on Wall Street, and across America that led to the near collapse of our financial system one year ago.
[00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:48.249]  So restoring a willingness to take responsibility, even when it's hard to do,
[00:24:49.656 --> 00:24:52.037]  Is at the heart of what we must do.
[00:24:52.037 --> 00:24:53.358]  More complete lies.
[00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:55.198]  Here on Wall Street, you have a responsibility.
[00:24:55.198 --> 00:24:56.799]  That's enough of him.
[00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:57.979]  That's enough of him.
[00:24:57.979 --> 00:25:00.981]  Here on Wall Street, you have a responsibility.
[00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:08.244]  He's speaking to the people that gave him four plus times, approaching five times, the money of John McCain.
[00:25:08.244 --> 00:25:10.545]  And no, get out of your left-right paradigm.
[00:25:10.545 --> 00:25:13.686]  I'm not saying vote for John McCain.
[00:25:13.686 --> 00:25:16.407]  I'm saying Obama was the heir apparent.
[00:25:16.407 --> 00:25:18.628]  He's who the establishment put their money on.
[00:25:19.932 --> 00:25:21.993]  McCain was the ringer.
[00:25:21.993 --> 00:25:27.414]  McCain was there to take a dive and McCain knew it the whole time.
[00:25:27.414 --> 00:25:31.376]  It's a sick, sick, sick joke.
[00:25:31.376 --> 00:25:35.677]  You got a guy on Wall Street's payroll.
[00:25:35.677 --> 00:25:48.981]  They're telling them they've got to take responsibility as they steal $23.7 trillion in 10 months, leverage it, leverage it to infinity.
[00:25:50.458 --> 00:25:57.669]  They're buying up all the smaller banks, the insurance companies, the roads, the ports, the infrastructure.
[00:25:57.669 --> 00:26:02.016]  They come in and pay your politicians one-tenth of what the property is worth.
[00:26:02.016 --> 00:26:03.619]  They take over the public trust.
[00:26:04.807 --> 00:26:18.135]  They're openly setting up the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts as Stasi spies and training the boys with M16s to quote, take on veterans and gun owners and the DHS reports expanded to say Ron Paul supporters.
[00:26:18.135 --> 00:26:22.057]  Yes, we're really turning in to Nazi Germany.
[00:26:22.057 --> 00:26:30.642]  And they got a slick, good-looking Harvard lawyer with a nice monotone, deep baritone voice there to sell you on your destruction.
[00:26:32.372 --> 00:26:54.900]  And then to control the opposition, they've got Glenn Beck there to lead you with the 9-12 movement in remembrance of 9-11, supporting the Patriot Act, supporting the DHS report, saying there's no FEMA camps even when the media admits there are, saying we need to arrest Ron Paul supporters and 9-11 truthers, saying the banker bailout was good.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.101]  I mean, how obvious is this?
[00:26:58.101 --> 00:27:00.782]  Well, it's not obvious enough to the left and the right
[00:27:01.656 --> 00:27:03.618]  Those people still in the control paradigm.
[00:27:03.618 --> 00:27:05.519]  And that is why we fail.
[00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:10.323]  That is why we're in a bad spot and it's getting worse.
[00:27:10.323 --> 00:27:12.384]  The water's rising.
[00:27:12.384 --> 00:27:15.527]  And that is why we're in such desperate straits.
[00:27:15.527 --> 00:27:22.472]  Yes, a lot of people are waking up, but it's not fast enough.
[00:27:22.472 --> 00:27:23.793]  And it is so painful to me
[00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.253]  To sit here and realize how obvious this is.
[00:27:30.253 --> 00:27:36.077]  I mean, I told you the minute Obama got elected he was going to do government takeover of healthcare, 20% of the economy.
[00:27:36.077 --> 00:27:49.328]  They were going to have another banking bailout that was going to be setting up the global regulatory system so the people that carried out the derivatives fraud could then come in and take over what's left of the economy.
[00:27:49.328 --> 00:27:52.291]  Don't forget Paul Watson and Steve Watson's important article
[00:27:55.586 --> 00:28:11.497]  And to his credit, Judge Napolitano, by the way, who I happen to know is a patriot, knows about the New World Order, and that's why they have him on Fox Internet TV.
[00:28:11.497 --> 00:28:16.540]  He does fill in for Beck occasionally, but they use him as camouflage.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.723]  They use him as a set piece to try to get real patriots to watch.
[00:28:20.723 --> 00:28:23.625]  And I want to reach out and be part of this open letter to Judge Napolitano.
[00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.850]  And tell him, don't sell out.
[00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.231]  But watching him, I don't think he can.
[00:28:29.231 --> 00:28:29.971]  He's like me.
[00:28:29.971 --> 00:28:32.571]  He can't sell people out.
[00:28:32.571 --> 00:28:34.332]  He just has to tell the truth.
[00:28:34.332 --> 00:28:43.573]  So they stick him with that Brian character, who sits there and salivates over torture and everything else.
[00:28:43.573 --> 00:28:45.454]  I just wish we had more good men out there.
[00:28:45.454 --> 00:28:46.974]  I just wish this didn't have to happen.
[00:28:46.974 --> 00:28:49.034]  Folks, this is going to be really bad.
[00:28:49.034 --> 00:28:53.895]  I want you to know, a lot of you that end up serving this system down the road are going to wish you'd done something.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:03.334]  Obama Regulatory Reform Plan Officially Establishing Banking Dictatorship and I'm going to read this article in full in the
[00:29:06.206 --> 00:29:10.147]  Third hour today, but I'm going to come back and just take calls for a full hour.
[00:29:10.147 --> 00:29:12.528]  Then I'm going to have my public message to Glenn Beck.
[00:29:12.528 --> 00:29:15.528]  Then I'm going to go over the history of the banking takeover.
[00:29:15.528 --> 00:29:26.051]  I'm trying to find that video we played four or five months ago where Napolitano basically word for word quoted me when he said, the banking regulatory system reform plan of Obama
[00:29:27.301 --> 00:29:27.881]  We're on the march.
[00:29:27.881 --> 00:29:28.662]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.864 --> 00:30:00.849]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.849 --> 00:30:03.872]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.872 --> 00:30:09.196]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.196 --> 00:30:11.238]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.238 --> 00:30:16.242]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.242 --> 00:30:17.163]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.403 --> 00:30:18.544]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.544 --> 00:30:20.425]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.425 --> 00:30:21.486]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:23.687]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.687 --> 00:30:25.028]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.028 --> 00:30:26.569]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.569 --> 00:30:31.833]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.833 --> 00:30:35.415]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.415 --> 00:30:38.878]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.238 --> 00:30:40.459]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.459 --> 00:30:41.360]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.460]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.401]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.401 --> 00:30:44.482]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.482 --> 00:30:47.544]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:30:49.325 --> 00:30:50.226]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.403 --> 00:31:07.425]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.425 --> 00:31:13.328]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.328 --> 00:31:19.470]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.771]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.771 --> 00:31:24.253]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.253 --> 00:31:37.440]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.101]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.101 --> 00:31:40.962]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.962 --> 00:31:47.186]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.859 --> 00:31:56.125]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.125 --> 00:31:57.706]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.706 --> 00:31:58.907]  The people strike back.
[00:32:04.804 --> 00:32:05.104]  I think so.
[00:32:20.657 --> 00:32:26.780]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[00:33:19.512 --> 00:33:27.538]  And that's why we need strong rules of the road to guard against the kind of systemic risks that we've seen.
[00:33:39.975 --> 00:33:42.557]  Okay, uh, a lot to talk about in the President's speech.
[00:33:42.557 --> 00:33:46.181]  We've got CNN's Chief Financial Correspondent, Ali Belshi, with us.
[00:33:46.181 --> 00:33:47.161]  There you go.
[00:33:47.161 --> 00:33:49.203]  The rules of the road.
[00:33:49.203 --> 00:33:55.469]  The very banks that engineered the collapse, by design, are now going to teach all of you the rules of the road.
[00:33:55.469 --> 00:34:00.213]  Isn't that nice?
[00:34:00.213 --> 00:34:05.337]  So coming up in an hour and a half, I'm going to spend a full hour breaking down the banking takeover.
[00:34:05.337 --> 00:34:07.900]  Now, they had always meant to launch this in the fall.
[00:34:09.249 --> 00:34:16.252]  And the fact that they've now moved on to this means that they are starting to abandon health care.
[00:34:16.252 --> 00:34:27.377]  Now that doesn't mean that they won't still tag health care on to the overall budget and ram it through and not care if it's unpopular.
[00:34:27.377 --> 00:34:29.437]  Not care if you don't want it.
[00:34:29.437 --> 00:34:30.498]  That's what Obama has said.
[00:34:30.498 --> 00:34:32.139]  There's a sense of urgency.
[00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.920]  They've got to fully bankrupt us now.
[00:34:36.405 --> 00:34:42.227]  And that's what the Club of Rome, the CFR, that's what all these scumbags openly talk about.
[00:34:42.227 --> 00:34:52.430]  And they openly brag and joke that you're a bunch of silly, dumbed down, easily confused TV heads, and so you deserve what's happening to you.
[00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:56.911]  You're like a ham on the table that is for dinner.
[00:34:56.911 --> 00:34:59.992]  You deserve to be fed upon.
[00:34:59.992 --> 00:35:05.534]  And the globalists have stated that they want a worldwide depression.
[00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:34.176]  That they want a worldwide depression so that they can bankrupt the economy and make everybody dependent on government and then force you to be so poor that you go on government welfare so they can then control your life and not give you the welfare check if you have more than one child.
[00:35:34.176 --> 00:35:35.597]  And they mean business.
[00:35:35.597 --> 00:35:37.899]  Okay, I want to go to Kenneth Ryan.
[00:35:39.247 --> 00:35:41.530]  Alex, Chris, James, and others.
[00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:42.711]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:35:42.711 --> 00:35:44.793]  But I will state again, big news on the Charlie Sheen front.
[00:35:50.854 --> 00:36:08.642]  Charlie will be joining us live tomorrow at 1.30 Central Standard Time, that's 2.30 Eastern, 11.30 Pacific, 12.30 Mountain, with some big announcements and the next phase in our operation to get 9-11 Truth on the front burner.
[00:36:08.642 --> 00:36:18.267]  We've been successful so far because of you, the listeners of this show, busting your butts to make his video message to the President, the number one video on YouTube.
[00:36:20.063 --> 00:36:30.100]  For one day, it's still the number one video in news and politics in that section, but it was the overall number one video with a half million views and growing just with that one version of it.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.285]  There's thousands of other versions around the web with millions of views together.
[00:36:34.974 --> 00:37:00.890]  But he's got some other announcements about debate challenges he's issued to O'Reilly, Hannity, John McCain's daughter that attacked him on The View, Popular Mechanics and others, and about his discussions with the White House about a meeting between him, Obama, and of course 9-11 victims' family members and survivors that want to meet with Obama to discuss six of the ten 9-11 Commission members going public saying that the officials
[00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:08.174]  Investigation was a fraud, a lie, a cover-up, and needs to be, quote, criminally investigated.
[00:37:08.174 --> 00:37:17.721]  So breaking news with Charlie coming up tomorrow, though later in the show I want to play the red eye on Fox, viciously attacking him, following the same playbook.
[00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:29.847]  Almost in the same exact order that O'Reilly and, of course, Geraldo followed over the weekend, on Friday and throughout the weekend.
[00:37:29.847 --> 00:37:32.089]  And what some of the other mainstream media is doing to attack.
[00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:33.990]  But overall, it's been a great success.
[00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.631]  Hundreds of papers we know of...
[00:37:36.554 --> 00:37:50.106]  linked directly from New Zealand to Russia to the United States to England from the LA Times to the London Telegraph either published or linked to his 20 bullet points that Charlie Sheen put out.
[00:37:50.106 --> 00:37:53.209]  Millions of people read it conservatively.
[00:37:53.209 --> 00:38:02.937]  Millions of people have woken up and we've got a new phase we're announcing tomorrow as well that will dwarf what Charlie and I and you the listeners have done in the last
[00:38:03.939 --> 00:38:07.580]  In the last seven days, since last Tuesday.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.201]  It will dwarf what we've done.
[00:38:10.201 --> 00:38:14.683]  If you take action and carry the ball on phase two, it will be launching tomorrow.
[00:38:14.683 --> 00:38:24.667]  But we'll get into some of the new attacks and hit pieces that are very educational and informative to go over and understand coming up later as well.
[00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:31.630]  But coming up in T-minus 52 minutes, I will be reaching out directly to Glenn Beck, so stay with us for that.
[00:38:32.605 --> 00:38:35.126]  And then I'm going to break down the entirety of the Banker Takeover bill.
[00:38:35.126 --> 00:38:41.850]  If you want to know what they're planning for you and your family, you'll learn coming up in an hour and 22 minutes.
[00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:43.711]  Right now, let's go to Kenneth in Texas.
[00:38:43.711 --> 00:38:46.412]  Kenneth, thanks for holding your on the air.
[00:38:46.412 --> 00:38:47.093]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:38:47.093 --> 00:38:47.933]  How are you doing?
[00:38:47.933 --> 00:38:49.554]  Good, sir.
[00:38:49.554 --> 00:38:53.916]  I wanted to tell you about something that happened last night, and it still kind of got me a little on edge.
[00:38:53.916 --> 00:38:59.239]  I live in Amarillo, Texas, which is, you know, the northernmost part of Texas.
[00:38:59.239 --> 00:39:00.420]  If I was to get in my car,
[00:39:01.081 --> 00:39:04.943]  And drive to, say, the Dallas-Fort Worth area would take six to seven hours.
[00:39:04.943 --> 00:39:06.724]  Probably take longer than that.
[00:39:06.724 --> 00:39:09.866]  Yeah, it might, depending on the highway traffic.
[00:39:09.866 --> 00:39:19.231]  Last night, around midnight, I wasn't paying exact attention to the time, got the emergency alert message that comes over the TV.
[00:39:19.231 --> 00:39:25.034]  Normally, at the end of the month, for a test for these parts, it's more, you know, weather-related.
[00:39:25.034 --> 00:39:27.075]  We'll get tornadoes and things like that.
[00:39:27.075 --> 00:39:29.897]  But you got a local one, and it was law enforcement-related?
[00:39:30.757 --> 00:39:36.778]  It was, actually what it said on the screen was civil authority warning.
[00:39:36.778 --> 00:39:39.179]  And it listed all of the counties in the surrounding area.
[00:39:39.179 --> 00:39:49.961]  Now the audio message was about a kidnapping victim and described the kidnapper and that they were armed and dangerous and that they were last seen in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
[00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:55.922]  My question is, why would they need to tell us that here six, seven hours away at midnight?
[00:39:55.922 --> 00:39:57.843]  Okay, have you seen my film Police State 2000?
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:07.705]  Well, you see the EAS emergency alert system right there in the film, and in that film I break down exactly what's happening.
[00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:09.666]  I appreciate your call.
[00:40:09.666 --> 00:40:13.929]  Let me comment on this now, briefly.
[00:40:13.929 --> 00:40:17.871]  None of this is my opinion.
[00:40:17.871 --> 00:40:27.538]  In 1988, the federal government introduced legislation that by federal law, all TVs, all clock radios,
[00:40:30.017 --> 00:40:48.053]  Would have a piece of equipment put in them, a primitive piece of radio equipment, a shortwave receiver, a tiny shortwave receiver, and that regional shortwave towers would take over your TV and your radio.
[00:40:49.258 --> 00:41:01.762]  With a federal command and give you audio messages about emergencies and civil emergencies or environmental emergencies, disasters.
[00:41:01.762 --> 00:41:04.323]  But it was decided that that would not be done at that time.
[00:41:04.323 --> 00:41:16.967]  Then in 1991, the federal government proposed legislation that all cable systems, all radio systems, all TV systems, all satellite systems, and all cell phone systems, by law,
[00:41:19.369 --> 00:41:25.874]  At the point of transmission or broadcast are wired through a FEMA box.
[00:41:25.874 --> 00:41:43.567]  That FEMA box receives powerful shortwave transmissions and transmits audio over the radio system or TV system.
[00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:45.109]  It didn't pass.
[00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.389]  In 1996 it did.
[00:41:47.833 --> 00:41:55.116]  And when you hear that computer sound, because I work in radio stations, and the board ops every day have to do the test.
[00:41:55.116 --> 00:41:59.698]  It doesn't go over air, but they have to practice, and little FEMA teletypes come out.
[00:41:59.698 --> 00:42:09.402]  It's similar to the systems, because they go with low tech to make sure it works, that they had in the 50s and the 60s with SAC, Strategic Air Command.
[00:42:12.421 --> 00:42:14.462]  You see a similar system in Dr. Strangelove.
[00:42:14.462 --> 00:42:23.785]  The Pentagon tried to block that film coming out saying that he put classified info out about the C1138 scrambler or whatever they call it in the film.
[00:42:23.785 --> 00:42:25.125]  It's got another name.
[00:42:25.125 --> 00:42:30.487]  But those are high-powered shortwave transmissions that then are decoded inside the machine.
[00:42:30.487 --> 00:42:33.328]  But now they're more advanced where the shortwave sends a code
[00:42:34.495 --> 00:42:43.702]  And a computer code, and then a computer voice can read, or it can take over your radio station, or it can do both.
[00:42:43.702 --> 00:42:52.329]  Now, the Texas Association of Broadcasters, I've talked to some of their top engineers over the years that have contacted me, being in stations, working in stations, I've talked to them.
[00:42:52.329 --> 00:42:55.651]  I've talked to the engineer that does 1260 when I've been over there filling in.
[00:42:55.651 --> 00:42:58.533]  I've talked to some of the 590 engineers.
[00:42:58.533 --> 00:43:03.117]  And they go, yeah, the feds are telling us in the last seven years, they've been hearing this for seven years,
[00:43:03.976 --> 00:43:10.283]  That soon the Feds are going to be taking over radio and TV every day.
[00:43:10.283 --> 00:43:19.572]  And they start out with things that sound reasonable like water restrictions or a person who's got Alzheimer's who's lost or a kidnapping.
[00:43:19.572 --> 00:43:22.415]  But it's already started in New Jersey, New York, and Virginia.
[00:43:22.415 --> 00:43:24.558]  I guess they think they have the people under their control there.
[00:43:26.288 --> 00:43:55.017]  where they put up toll-free numbers saying report terrorism or report illegal guns and they have these big billboards on the highways in Austin and for three months it'll be blue car missing with Alzheimer's patient from Dallas and it's just meant to sound reasonable and get you used to seeing messages from the feds and I was in Walgreens uh... the other day buying a toothbrush and it was flashing
[00:43:56.135 --> 00:43:57.636]  An Amber Alert now.
[00:43:57.636 --> 00:44:09.124]  So now the Walgreens and local businesses and now the Feds are saying under the Telecommunications Act of 96, it's already in power, the Feds have a line to your cell phone.
[00:44:09.124 --> 00:44:13.087]  It tracks you in real time, it listens to you, they can dial in even when your phone's turned off.
[00:44:13.087 --> 00:44:14.969]  I told you that in 96, people laugh now.
[00:44:14.969 --> 00:44:20.332]  They announce it to let the slaves know because they're getting ready to openly use it.
[00:44:20.332 --> 00:44:25.116]  The local Emergency Management Threat Fusion Center integrates all of this into one area.
[00:44:26.863 --> 00:44:35.255]  Into one hub and what they're doing is
[00:44:38.482 --> 00:44:41.383]  They are just completely creating a running man system.
[00:44:41.383 --> 00:44:55.667]  You know, in the movie Running Man that came out in, what, the mid-eighties, they're living in a police state and there's cameras everywhere, they got big jumbo-scrawn TVs reporting this person, reporting that person, reminding you not to be out after dark or you'll be permanently detained.
[00:44:55.667 --> 00:45:04.749]  And now the feds are coming in to hack and sack New York.
[00:45:04.749 --> 00:45:05.950]  Or am I getting the two mixed up?
[00:45:07.566 --> 00:45:09.127]  Schenectady, New York.
[00:45:09.127 --> 00:45:11.948]  Not Hackensack's in Wisconsin.
[00:45:11.948 --> 00:45:12.988]  Schenectady, New York.
[00:45:12.988 --> 00:45:15.209]  But there was also one in Hackensack.
[00:45:15.209 --> 00:45:16.630]  So I got the two crossed.
[00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:18.551]  Saying, oh, we need martial law.
[00:45:18.551 --> 00:45:19.491]  You can't come out at night.
[00:45:19.491 --> 00:45:21.052]  The Army's now here.
[00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:25.954]  Oh, the Army and Marines are here running checkpoints in Central California.
[00:45:25.954 --> 00:45:27.695]  You know, you're not for drunk driving, are you?
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.601]  And then in Tennessee, remember three months ago, we had the state rep on.
[00:45:34.601 --> 00:45:40.584]  The Army suddenly showed up with Homeland Security setting up checkpoints, searching everybody's cars, and the governor came out and said, stop that.
[00:45:40.584 --> 00:45:42.765]  And the Army said, we'll do what we want.
[00:45:42.765 --> 00:45:44.326]  Sit down and shut up.
[00:45:44.326 --> 00:45:50.648]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act, under the authority of NORTHCOM and Homeland Security, we're going to search your cars.
[00:45:50.648 --> 00:45:52.229]  Nothing to do with anti-terror.
[00:45:54.602 --> 00:45:58.684]  They announce it's all for anti-terror to set up checkpoints.
[00:45:58.684 --> 00:46:03.287]  They announce, oh, community meetings in local farming areas and big cities alike.
[00:46:03.287 --> 00:46:05.929]  Oh, come to the local meeting and learn how to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:09.551]  All the old folks show up and they spend 10 minutes on Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:09.551 --> 00:46:12.392]  Give everybody free donuts and coffee.
[00:46:12.392 --> 00:46:14.754]  And then say, now, if you see your neighbor spank,
[00:46:15.848 --> 00:46:18.649]  Their kid, you call the local police.
[00:46:18.649 --> 00:46:21.290]  If you see pot plants, call the local police.
[00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:24.932]  Does your neighbor have cars that are nicer than they should for their job?
[00:46:24.932 --> 00:46:27.353]  Call the local threat integration center.
[00:46:27.353 --> 00:46:34.335]  Because having money they're not supposed to could be a connection to terrorism.
[00:46:34.335 --> 00:46:39.057]  And we have the local police watching the FBI training videos that teach them the same thing.
[00:46:39.057 --> 00:46:40.418]  It's diabolical!
[00:46:41.423 --> 00:46:43.644]  Criminals have seized the government.
[00:46:43.644 --> 00:46:47.725]  They plan on looting everything until everybody is basically poor.
[00:46:47.725 --> 00:46:49.245]  That's how they like it.
[00:46:49.245 --> 00:46:52.966]  The elite love having their money and having you totally poor.
[00:46:52.966 --> 00:46:55.267]  Then they get to have sex with all your daughters.
[00:46:55.267 --> 00:46:58.188]  Then they get to put you in a prison and torture you to death.
[00:46:58.188 --> 00:47:03.069]  They get to drive around and fly around in their helicopters above all the shantytowns.
[00:47:03.069 --> 00:47:04.990]  They enjoy it.
[00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.910]  They like it.
[00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.911]  They like exercising power over you.
[00:47:08.942 --> 00:47:16.145]  And Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh and Barack Obama all work for the same people.
[00:47:16.145 --> 00:47:27.149]  And so, yes, they are now incrementally taking over radios, taking over TVs with the messages for kidnapped children and lost Alzheimer's patients.
[00:47:27.149 --> 00:47:30.110]  And the Jumbotron TVs are being put up.
[00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:33.811]  And the big Jumbo-sized billboards are being put up.
[00:47:33.811 --> 00:47:35.252]  And this is the new America.
[00:47:36.331 --> 00:47:47.363]  And the Girl Scouts are openly, quote, going to help spy on the neighbors and look for Al-Qaeda and drug users and parents that spank their kids, even though it's not illegal.
[00:47:47.363 --> 00:47:51.488]  And if you say you don't want the Gardasil shot, CPS is going to take your kids.
[00:47:51.488 --> 00:47:52.849]  Doesn't matter if they're in the law.
[00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:59.052]  And they're going to take you to a jail cell, and they're going to bring in somebody, and they're going to knock your teeth out.
[00:47:59.052 --> 00:48:00.353]  Because they like it.
[00:48:00.353 --> 00:48:04.715]  Because that pot-bellied jail guard has a 75 IQ.
[00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:09.437]  But he knows he likes to hear you cry naked in the cell.
[00:48:09.437 --> 00:48:11.918]  And he's going to beat you and break your ribs.
[00:48:11.918 --> 00:48:12.958]  He likes it.
[00:48:12.958 --> 00:48:14.019]  He's going to do it.
[00:48:14.699 --> 00:48:16.580]  They're going to rape your daughter.
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:25.665]  And then when they're done, they're going to finally, once they have their system in, they're going to starve whole communities and march people into dirt pits and shoot you in the back of the head.
[00:48:25.665 --> 00:48:27.086]  It's going to happen.
[00:48:27.086 --> 00:48:28.387]  They mean business.
[00:48:28.387 --> 00:48:29.788]  We know what this is.
[00:48:29.788 --> 00:48:32.949]  We've seen it over a hundred times in the 20th century alone.
[00:48:32.949 --> 00:48:34.370]  It is now happening.
[00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:40.994]  The same international eugenics banks that funded Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin, and Hitler are now in control.
[00:48:43.379 --> 00:48:45.240]  Do you understand?
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:52.824]  And yes, they're just going to continue to take over your local radio and TV and have emergency management announcements and anti-gun announcements.
[00:48:52.824 --> 00:48:56.867]  And they're going to have your kids come home and denounce you for a hot bath.
[00:48:56.867 --> 00:49:00.989]  And the New York Times reports kids all over the country and the New York Times says it's a good thing.
[00:49:00.989 --> 00:49:02.990]  Write mock tickets.
[00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:04.631]  The school sends them home with mock tickets.
[00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:05.752]  They're called climate cops.
[00:49:06.974 --> 00:49:09.975]  And they wear red and black uniforms in England and the U.S.
[00:49:09.975 --> 00:49:11.515]  And so does the city here.
[00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:12.635]  Same deal.
[00:49:12.635 --> 00:49:16.156]  And the kids are even given a little ball cap.
[00:49:16.156 --> 00:49:17.656]  And a little patch on their arm.
[00:49:17.656 --> 00:49:24.998]  Same thing as a... You know, as the Nazis wore.
[00:49:24.998 --> 00:49:28.599]  And they come home and they say, Mom, you don't leave the faucet on when you brush your teeth.
[00:49:28.599 --> 00:49:29.839]  Oh, thank you, honey.
[00:49:29.839 --> 00:49:33.300]  And the mother's in the newspaper going, Oh, it's so good she tells me what to do in Long Island.
[00:49:34.226 --> 00:49:39.295]  And the paper says how wonderful that children denounce her and say that she can only take a cold bath.
[00:49:39.295 --> 00:49:42.240]  Heating the water is a bad carbon footprint.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.005]  As her seven and eight year olds denounce her.
[00:49:45.005 --> 00:49:46.988]  So yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's real.
[00:49:48.348 --> 00:49:49.989]  It's absolutely real.
[00:49:49.989 --> 00:50:04.033]  And when Glenn Beck revealed, a year and a half ago, when he got up on TV and said, we need to use the army against Ron Paul supporters, they're dangerous extremists, I went on air and I said, that is an internal government report.
[00:50:04.033 --> 00:50:05.654]  I'd seen scores of them.
[00:50:05.654 --> 00:50:13.917]  We just got attention when we broke the 50th, 60th, 70th, I don't know, it was in those numbers, of government reports.
[00:50:14.986 --> 00:50:21.253]  It finally got report news, finally got coverage when I broke the MIAC and the DHS.
[00:50:21.253 --> 00:50:27.880]  But I knew when Beck read that, a year before that MIAC report came out, I said, he's following government scripts.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.585]  That guy is directly following ADL Homeland Security templates.
[00:50:32.585 --> 00:50:34.567]  And a chill hit me, I went, whoa!
[00:50:34.567 --> 00:50:35.548]  Actual black ops!
[00:50:36.884 --> 00:50:39.585]  And so that's why, coming up in 35 minutes, I'm going to break that down.
[00:50:39.585 --> 00:50:41.725]  But I'm going to try to go to your calls quicker now.
[00:50:41.725 --> 00:50:44.626]  Just Kenneth brought up a key nexus point to all of this.
[00:50:44.626 --> 00:50:49.968]  Ryan, Alex, Chris, James, and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[00:50:49.968 --> 00:50:50.408]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:50.408 --> 00:50:55.509]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:55.509 --> 00:50:58.030]  We're risking our lives to tell you the bottom line.
[00:51:02.142 --> 00:51:12.046]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries?
[00:51:12.046 --> 00:51:14.087]  If so, you are not alone.
[00:51:14.087 --> 00:51:17.308]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems.
[00:51:17.588 --> 00:51:18.108]  We're good to go.
[00:51:35.964 --> 00:51:36.324]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:36.324 --> 00:51:36.885]  A new world order.
[00:52:05.416 --> 00:52:10.318]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:10.318 --> 00:52:13.139]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:13.139 --> 00:52:15.921]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:52:15.921 --> 00:52:19.122]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:19.122 --> 00:52:24.965]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:29.468 --> 00:52:34.892]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:52:34.892 --> 00:52:38.774]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:52:38.774 --> 00:52:41.336]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:52:41.336 --> 00:52:42.517]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:42.517 --> 00:52:43.297]  They're not after money.
[00:52:43.297 --> 00:52:44.558]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:44.558 --> 00:52:45.539]  They're after power.
[00:52:45.539 --> 00:52:46.700]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:55.425]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:55.425 --> 00:52:58.227]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:52:58.227 --> 00:52:59.348]  You have been warned.
[00:53:00.229 --> 00:53:02.991]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[00:53:02.991 --> 00:53:04.253]  I've been so sick.
[00:53:04.253 --> 00:53:05.934]  Will the life change tea help me?
[00:53:05.934 --> 00:53:07.796]  Our answer is always the same.
[00:53:07.796 --> 00:53:13.922]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water, and air are attacking you this very moment.
[00:53:13.922 --> 00:53:19.407]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[00:53:19.807 --> 00:53:24.293]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[00:53:24.293 --> 00:53:25.715]  We use results.
[00:53:25.715 --> 00:53:30.480]  Life Change T's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.766]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[00:53:35.086 --> 00:53:38.949]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:42.853]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[00:53:42.853 --> 00:53:47.817]  Our number is 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[00:53:47.817 --> 00:53:50.819]  Again, that's 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[00:53:50.819 --> 00:53:54.562]  Or you can order online at getthet.com.
[00:53:54.562 --> 00:53:57.104]  That's getthet.com.
[00:53:57.104 --> 00:54:01.468]  And remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[00:54:01.468 --> 00:54:03.810]  No one knows what it's like
[00:54:04.534 --> 00:54:32.203]  To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes No one knows what it's like To be hated To be faded To telling only lies But my dreams
[00:54:33.792 --> 00:54:59.646]  Seems they aren't as empty As my conscience seems to be I have hours only lonely My love is vengeance that's never free
[00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:19.177]  Alright, we're going back to your phone calls here.
[00:55:19.177 --> 00:55:30.346]  I just hope everybody realizes that the long road to being there in a death pit isn't as long as it once was.
[00:55:30.346 --> 00:55:31.147]  We're far down it.
[00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:42.227]  And if they implode the economy, most of these police, most of these military people, incrementally will follow their orders.
[00:55:42.227 --> 00:55:46.009]  And they are definitely following that path, they definitely intend to carry this out.
[00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:50.312]  I want everybody to know, I mean what I'm telling you.
[00:55:50.312 --> 00:55:54.494]  This isn't a game, and this doesn't have to happen, but these people are making a try.
[00:55:54.494 --> 00:55:58.656]  They're really going for broke, they're really trying to bring in an absolute tyranny here.
[00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:04.565]  Ryan in Wisconsin, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[00:56:04.565 --> 00:56:06.226]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:56:06.226 --> 00:56:22.291]  I called San Francisco a couple of weeks ago and they said they gave out details about how the sterilization of their crops would take off half of the population and that would be eugenics.
[00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:23.672]  I'm having trouble following you.
[00:56:23.672 --> 00:56:25.933]  Specifically, what are you saying?
[00:56:25.933 --> 00:56:29.894]  You said that the Pope was against eugenics.
[00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:42.898]  But I read online that the Pontifical Academy of Science said that genetically modified organisms was okay.
[00:56:42.898 --> 00:56:44.199]  Yeah, well, I'm not a Catholic.
[00:56:44.199 --> 00:56:45.480]  Are you a Catholic?
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.820]  No, my father is.
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:50.001]  Well, maybe you can tell me more about it.
[00:56:50.001 --> 00:56:57.865]  I was... I believe a caller called whenever I was reading an article about the Pope calling for a New World Order.
[00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:05.576]  And then the caller called in and said, there are a lot of Catholic movements that are against eugenics and abortion.
[00:57:05.576 --> 00:57:21.850]  And so, abortion and GMO crops are two different things, but yes, the genetically modified cross-species crops, in every case they test them, are linked to massive reductions in reproductive fertility.
[00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:25.613]  And so, I'm not really up on
[00:57:27.253 --> 00:57:34.320]  The information being put out by the Vatican on that, but I have no doubt that what you're saying is true.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.042]  And then one more question.
[00:57:36.042 --> 00:57:40.166]  Do all roads lead to Rome?
[00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:44.651]  Well, that's an old saying from when Rome had an empire going.
[00:57:44.651 --> 00:57:49.196]  But I think Rome's a big part of the New World Order, and I've always said that, and I appreciate your call.
[00:57:50.526 --> 00:57:59.752]  We found out an Israeli diamond merchant, kind of an Israeli propaganda arm, they want to play everybody off against each other and that's what empires do.
[00:57:59.752 --> 00:58:07.558]  So they get the anti-Semitic groups fighting with the anti-Catholic groups and try to play people off against each other.
[00:58:07.558 --> 00:58:12.081]  But I'm not in the anti-Semitic class and I'm not in the anti-Catholic groups.
[00:58:13.308 --> 00:58:15.329]  And it's just all mental illness.
[00:58:15.329 --> 00:58:30.458]  And I'm not a Scientologist, and I'm not owned by a Saudi Arabian company, and ABC News has nothing to do with us, and I have nothing to do with Seagram's Distilleries, and I have nothing... It's about the information.
[00:58:30.458 --> 00:58:33.039]  They're building death camps.
[00:58:33.039 --> 00:58:38.122]  But if we're talking about blood-drinking lizards and the Pope all day, we'll never be able to stop it.
[00:58:42.833 --> 00:58:45.335]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.335 --> 00:58:50.478]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.478 --> 00:58:54.720]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.721]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.721 --> 00:59:05.247]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.247 --> 00:59:10.790]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:12.411]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.651 --> 00:59:19.153]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.153 --> 00:59:30.216]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.216 --> 00:59:30.676]  That's right.
[00:59:30.976 --> 00:59:33.638]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.154 --> 01:00:09.978]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.978 --> 01:00:11.559]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.559 --> 01:00:13.120]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:17.303]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.303 --> 01:00:21.387]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.152 --> 01:00:39.901]  All of our standard of livings have dropped on average more than 50% since the late 1960s in every major index of the different economists we interview.
[01:00:39.901 --> 01:00:44.224]  It's going to drop by another 50% in the next five years.
[01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:53.992]  And somehow we need to get focused on the quote financial reform that Obama proposed six months ago is now being re-proposed and coming up in the next hour I'm going to detail that.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:03.306]  Also, I'm going to reach out to Glenn Beck in an open letter to him coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:01:03.306 --> 01:01:06.128]  We're continuing with your phone calls right now.
[01:01:06.128 --> 01:01:08.130]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Florida.
[01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:10.031]  Alex, you're on the air.
[01:01:10.031 --> 01:01:12.013]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:01:12.013 --> 01:01:19.118]  I work with the FederalJack.com website and we are up with We Are Change this weekend in New York for the 9-11 events.
[01:01:19.118 --> 01:01:21.600]  Yeah, I like the stuff that Federal Jack is doing.
[01:01:22.642 --> 01:01:23.782]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:01:23.782 --> 01:01:25.643]  We work really hard on it.
[01:01:25.643 --> 01:01:33.125]  We got a bunch of great video that we posted up from the weekend, and when we returned, we find that YouTube has just pulled our account as of this morning.
[01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:39.767]  And we have hours and hours and hours of videos that have garnered hundreds of thousands of hits over the last few months.
[01:01:39.767 --> 01:01:41.748]  Are they claiming a copyright infringement?
[01:01:42.745 --> 01:01:43.445]  They're not telling us.
[01:01:43.445 --> 01:01:45.426]  It just says that I didn't receive an email.
[01:01:45.426 --> 01:01:55.828]  It just said your account has been suspended and all the pages are now... Oh man, and Federal Jack, because we link to it a lot, had hundreds of thousands of views on some of its videos alone.
[01:01:55.828 --> 01:02:02.350]  I never counted up all your hits, but that's why you should always create copies or clones.
[01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:07.471]  We have more than 10 YouTube accounts, some we don't even really advertise that we have clones up on.
[01:02:08.636 --> 01:02:25.031]  But just re-upload all your videos, we'll continue to try to link to all your great work, and go into your account, request that YouTube tell you why, and then file.
[01:02:25.031 --> 01:02:34.339]  Because if you find out that it was a copyright infringement, they're usually fake, then you've got to file, and you can find copies of other federal filings and
[01:02:36.175 --> 01:02:38.135]  Write up your own report.
[01:02:38.135 --> 01:02:44.037]  I wrote up a novel report and filed it in federal court, and it's free to file in federal court.
[01:02:44.037 --> 01:02:49.538]  But I mean, I had to file in the district in Texas to get the Alex Jones channel back up.
[01:02:49.538 --> 01:02:55.580]  That hadn't been our channel, but we had to take it over because the fan didn't really know how to do that.
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:01.961]  He's a great guy, Dave does a great job, but he didn't want to, he wasn't comfortable filing federal filings, so I filed it.
[01:03:01.961 --> 01:03:03.822]  It took me about three hours to write it, but they
[01:03:06.172 --> 01:03:11.474]  They accepted it, and then it found out that it was fake filings to begin with.
[01:03:11.474 --> 01:03:16.756]  Just like they took the Joker posters down off Facebook with fake filings.
[01:03:16.756 --> 01:03:20.477]  And the good news is they've done that so much now that they don't just accept the first filings.
[01:03:20.477 --> 01:03:24.399]  So, it's all part of a process, but I would imagine that's what happened to you.
[01:03:24.399 --> 01:03:33.662]  If they don't tell you why they did it... See, YouTube is privately owned, but they hold out that they are free for free speech and open community.
[01:03:34.724 --> 01:03:39.167]  But they have been taking my videos down for quote, racism reasons.
[01:03:39.167 --> 01:03:42.329]  And I mean, nothing said about race.
[01:03:42.329 --> 01:03:49.354]  And I was watching CNN this morning and the redhead info babe said, it's racism, that's what the tea parties are about.
[01:03:49.354 --> 01:03:53.617]  And then they were lying about what Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh say.
[01:03:53.617 --> 01:03:57.840]  You can say what you want about Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh, but they're not racist folks.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.401]  They don't talk about race on their show.
[01:04:04.488 --> 01:04:09.351]  I'm just sick of these race pimps, but give folks the Federal Jack website.
[01:04:09.351 --> 01:04:11.572]  It's at federaljack.com.
[01:04:11.572 --> 01:04:17.555]  And we've got the phone number to YouTube up there, and we're encouraging people to call and... Alright.
[01:04:17.555 --> 01:04:23.838]  But I know you guys are working hard, but people should volunteer there in Florida, and start not just uploading to YouTube.
[01:04:23.838 --> 01:04:31.963]  Upload there, and then like BlipTV or something else, and then always in YouTube point out your other account.
[01:04:31.963 --> 01:04:32.203]  Okay?
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:34.780]  Thanks a lot.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.461]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:36.462]  Hey, you bet, Alex.
[01:04:36.462 --> 01:04:37.543]  Sorry to hear that happen.
[01:04:37.543 --> 01:04:39.285]  Great folks over there.
[01:04:39.285 --> 01:04:40.626]  Okay, and that's what I like.
[01:04:40.626 --> 01:04:48.874]  We don't need just Info Warrior groups, or We Are Change groups, or Federal Jack groups, or 9-11 Truth groups, or Culpepper groups.
[01:04:48.874 --> 01:04:56.542]  We need hundreds and hundreds of different groups, different names, an unstoppable tide of liberty, so they can't demonize just one group.
[01:04:57.162 --> 01:04:58.183]  Very, very exciting.
[01:04:58.183 --> 01:05:00.405]  You are in the true spirit of 1776.
[01:05:00.405 --> 01:05:05.730]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:10.254]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:12.536]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.536 --> 01:05:14.158]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.158 --> 01:05:15.179]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.419 --> 01:05:23.842]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:05:37.326 --> 01:05:42.908]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:05:43.348 --> 01:05:47.491]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[01:06:00.745 --> 01:06:05.950]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:09.975]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.975 --> 01:06:15.881]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.881 --> 01:06:20.946]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.946 --> 01:06:21.407]  Number three,
[01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:28.153]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:06:28.153 --> 01:06:31.056]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:06:31.056 --> 01:06:35.580]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.183]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:06:39.423 --> 01:06:45.145]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:06:45.145 --> 01:06:49.847]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:49.847 --> 01:06:51.627]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:12.612]  From the Berkey Guy, who brought you the Berkey Light Water Purification Specials, and the KDF Shower Filter, now comes the newest Berkey water purification system, the Go Berkey Kit.
[01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:16.995]  This latest stainless steel Berkey includes everything you need to take your Berkey on the go.

[01:07:47.108 --> 01:07:48.488]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.875 --> 01:08:18.335]  Thank you.
[01:08:46.852 --> 01:08:49.954]  During the Governor's conference call last night, here's what Governor Pawlenty said.
[01:08:49.954 --> 01:08:56.397]  Quote, depending on what the federal government comes out with here, asserting the 10th Amendment might be a viable option.
[01:08:56.397 --> 01:09:02.140]  We can't really even get the President to outline what he does or doesn't support in any detail, so we'll have to see.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:04.281]  I'd say that's a possibility.
[01:09:04.281 --> 01:09:08.243]  If we're a little rusty on the Constitution, here's what the 10th Amendment says.
[01:09:08.243 --> 01:09:16.047]  Quote, the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.
[01:09:16.927 --> 01:09:35.136]  The one little problem with the argument from the Tenthers, as they like to call it, is this other part of the Constitution that's called Article 1, you know, Article 1, quote, The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.
[01:09:35.876 --> 01:09:40.697]  That means it unambiguously authorizes Congress to spend money in ways that benefit the nation.
[01:09:40.697 --> 01:09:44.979]  You know, Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Care, etc, etc.
[01:09:44.979 --> 01:09:47.019]  So what are the tenters really up to?
[01:09:47.019 --> 01:09:51.900]  Here to face off are Democratic strategist Karen Finney and Republican strategist Ron Christie.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:59.022]  Ron, most people in the right-thinking mind know that the Tenth Amendment is a bunch of baloney, so what is Tim Pawlenty going for politically here?
[01:09:59.022 --> 01:10:03.804]  Is he simply trying to appeal to the right-wing fringe and get ready for a run in 2012?
[01:10:08.527 --> 01:10:11.108]  Thank you for joining us today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:11.108 --> 01:10:24.791]  We were just playing a clip of MSNBC implying that there's no Tenth Amendment right in this country and that the federal government can do whatever it wants, whenever it wants, however it wants.
[01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:30.252]  We are continuing with your phone calls on a host of issues.
[01:10:30.252 --> 01:10:35.013]  Coming up in about 25 minutes, I've got a personal message to Glenn Beck.
[01:10:37.406 --> 01:10:48.470]  An open letter to Glenn Beck, where I'm going to break down his real record and ask him to think twice about being a Benedict Arnold.
[01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:50.211]  And is he really happy?
[01:10:50.211 --> 01:11:00.034]  Is the $50 million to sell out the Patriot movement worth it for what he's doing?
[01:11:00.034 --> 01:11:02.495]  So, that's coming up.
[01:11:02.495 --> 01:11:05.016]  In the next hour, I'm going to break down in great detail
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:12.982]  The complete takeover of the economy through the quote, financial reform package.
[01:11:12.982 --> 01:11:19.564]  In light of President Obama's speech he gave to Wall Street, from Wall Street, this morning.
[01:11:19.564 --> 01:11:21.944]  And we're going to continue with open phones.
[01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.545]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:25.285]  Chris in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:11:25.285 --> 01:11:26.506]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:11:26.506 --> 01:11:27.706]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:11:27.706 --> 01:11:33.688]  I just wanted to say, you know, I want to thank you and the team for everything you guys do, and I stand by you guys until the very end.
[01:11:34.546 --> 01:11:42.110]  Um, you know, with everything that's going on, I think that, going back, I never listen to a word the guy says, I never listen to a word Obama says either.
[01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:50.875]  It's all a bunch of lies, and I think when Obama's coming out saying that all the banks are going to get more power, I think it's ridiculous.
[01:11:50.875 --> 01:11:54.277]  I think if you give the Federal Reserve more power, they're just going to continue to inflate the money.
[01:11:54.277 --> 01:12:03.882]  Um, you know, so I'm totally against it, and I think that people are waking up, and I think that the media coming out and lying about the numbers on the streets really just shows
[01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:06.892]  How desperate they're actually getting.
[01:12:06.892 --> 01:12:10.954]  So, you know, I just hope you guys keep it up because I get all my news from InfoWars.
[01:12:10.954 --> 01:12:15.235]  I never watch... I cancel my media or my mainstream TV.
[01:12:15.235 --> 01:12:16.216]  Never turn that stuff on.
[01:12:16.216 --> 01:12:16.996]  It makes me sick.
[01:12:16.996 --> 01:12:20.778]  So, I'm just hoping that we win this fight and I stand by you guys.
[01:12:20.778 --> 01:12:22.558]  So, thanks for everything you do.
[01:12:22.558 --> 01:12:23.399]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:12:23.399 --> 01:12:33.703]  I would still challenge you to not just only get your news at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but to go to the government documents, to go to the legislation we list, to
[01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:40.996]  Look at everything we're covering, because we're not 100% perfect.
[01:12:40.996 --> 01:12:42.297]  We try to be accurate.
[01:12:42.297 --> 01:12:44.039]  We try to tell the truth.
[01:12:44.039 --> 01:12:47.702]  We're about 97% accurate.
[01:12:47.702 --> 01:12:50.545]  Normally, when we're wrong, it's worse than we said.
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:53.982]  And that's why we encourage people to research.
[01:12:53.982 --> 01:12:57.206]  Most of what we come up with is sent to us by you.
[01:12:57.206 --> 01:13:03.413]  You'll say, hey, look at this magazine, look at this trade publication, look at this subsection in the legislation.
[01:13:03.413 --> 01:13:06.897]  You are where the credit comes in.
[01:13:06.897 --> 01:13:10.621]  And we're posting more and more reader-generated articles.
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:23.991]  I'm trying to hire a couple more editors and webmasters so they can just go through all the great stuff you send us and all the great stuff that's posted on the Prison Planet Forum, so we can then link to it on the main websites or put it in article form.
[01:13:23.991 --> 01:13:29.335]  But you can submit your own articles, your own stories that we'll look over and see if they are documented.
[01:13:29.335 --> 01:13:30.536]  And then post!
[01:13:30.536 --> 01:13:33.219]  Writers at Infowars.com.
[01:13:33.219 --> 01:13:37.002]  Let us know it's an article you've written that you're submitting for us to publish.
[01:13:37.002 --> 01:13:38.604]  I want to create an area that's just
[01:13:39.847 --> 01:13:44.330]  Listener and viewer commentary.
[01:13:44.330 --> 01:14:05.965]  We should create a whole section on InfoWars and Prison Planet on that just for people's opinions so we can basically put everything you send us there and then have some of that material that's more news articles or investigative reports published as main articles on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:14:05.965 --> 01:14:09.107]  But as Ronald Reagan said, trust but verify.
[01:14:09.963 --> 01:14:16.707]  Because sometimes you do show us when we're wrong about something.
[01:14:16.707 --> 01:14:19.849]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:14:19.849 --> 01:14:22.871]  Let's talk to James in Texas.
[01:14:22.871 --> 01:14:24.332]  James, you're on the air.
[01:14:24.332 --> 01:14:30.516]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call and I appreciate what you're doing.
[01:14:30.516 --> 01:14:35.480]  I don't trust that big Republican demonstration they just had in Washington.
[01:14:37.713 --> 01:14:42.755]  That was led by Dick Armey and Glenn Beck.
[01:14:42.755 --> 01:14:58.761]  I think they're paid and backed by the big drug companies and the big insurance companies, and those are the people that want to see Obama fail in his health initiative, and I think we need the public health option.
[01:14:58.761 --> 01:15:04.083]  You know, if Jefferson was here today, he'd be a liberal.
[01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.063]  He'd be a Democrat.
[01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:12.471]  It'd be pushing for benefits to the people, like this health...
[01:15:14.217 --> 01:15:18.340]  Well, I don't think it's fair for you to put words in Jefferson's mouth.
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:25.524]  I've actually read several of the books written by Thomas Jefferson and his incredibly complex and detailed prose.
[01:15:25.524 --> 01:15:32.088]  I have read hundreds of news articles, editorials written by him in major papers.
[01:15:32.088 --> 01:15:36.270]  I have read over a hundred books on the Founding Fathers alone.
[01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:41.954]  And if you actually knew who Thomas Jefferson was, who swore eternal resistance
[01:15:42.794 --> 01:15:57.700]  On the altar of God, against all forms of tyranny over the minds of men, you would have known he was against big government and big large S and the distortion of Article 1 of the Constitution of the General Welfare.
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:07.544]  The General Welfare is enumerated in issuing the money so there's not inflation, defending the borders, and negotiating trade disputes between the states.
[01:16:07.544 --> 01:16:08.084]  That's it!
[01:16:08.624 --> 01:16:13.467]  The federal government has no business running our schools, running our lives.
[01:16:13.467 --> 01:16:18.349]  The insurance companies, sir, are actually funding Obama.
[01:16:18.349 --> 01:16:20.310]  He got more money than them than McCain did.
[01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:25.693]  They're actually, just like British Petroleum is funding the global greenhouse movement.
[01:16:25.693 --> 01:16:31.716]  That's admitted, but the news says big oil companies are against it.
[01:16:31.716 --> 01:16:33.197]  Sir, do you know what eugenics is?
[01:16:33.197 --> 01:16:36.739]  Do you understand that Tom Daschle did write a book?
[01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:40.850]  I think you're a little bit too paranoid on that, Hal.
[01:17:08.476 --> 01:17:10.797]  Hold on.
[01:17:10.797 --> 01:17:14.620]  James in Texas, are you a new listener to the show?
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:18.522]  No sir, I've been listening to you for probably over ten years.
[01:17:18.522 --> 01:17:23.546]  Okay, then you know I'm not a big Republican like they're saying I am now.
[01:17:23.546 --> 01:17:24.806]  You know I went after Bush.
[01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:28.069]  I just tell the truth as best as I can find it.
[01:17:28.069 --> 01:17:31.711]  What's the solution how we can't just
[01:17:32.524 --> 01:17:36.146]  We're going to wind up... Sir, don't you understand they control both parties?
[01:17:36.146 --> 01:17:47.130]  Can't you understand they create these fake fights between Republican and Democrat and then there's really not a hair breadth of difference between the two parties in reality?
[01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:50.412]  That's where you're wrong, how there is some difference.
[01:17:50.412 --> 01:18:00.156]  And I realize some of the Democrats are just about as bad as the Republicans, but the Republicans too, a man, supported Bush and
[01:18:01.006 --> 01:18:06.448]  Listen, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:15.630]  Sir, Obama took 50,000 troops out of Iraq and put 50,000 contractors in and sent the 50,000 troops to Afghanistan.
[01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:19.191]  He increased the troops.
[01:18:19.191 --> 01:18:23.892]  But because he acts liberal, you think the war is okay now?
[01:18:23.892 --> 01:18:29.094]  I mean, you're telling me there's a difference and there's only a difference in rhetoric.
[01:18:31.246 --> 01:18:34.088]  And Obama can read off a teleprompter better.
[01:18:34.088 --> 01:18:35.470]  It's so elementary.
[01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:38.172]  Listen to me, buddy boy.
[01:18:38.172 --> 01:18:42.776]  Obama supported everything Bush has done and he has expanded it.
[01:18:42.776 --> 01:18:53.324]  To a T. To a T. And Obama is meant to not give you the public option.
[01:18:53.324 --> 01:18:57.248]  He's meant to give you some corporate write-off scam
[01:18:58.453 --> 01:19:18.406]  Where the insurance companies get government liability protection and the government gets to now get a piece of our paychecks to quote give people government subsidized health care.
[01:19:18.406 --> 01:19:20.048]  You're not getting it free.
[01:19:20.048 --> 01:19:22.129]  Don't you understand nothing's free?
[01:19:22.129 --> 01:19:24.731]  There's no free lunch, pal.
[01:19:24.731 --> 01:19:26.512]  Don't you understand that
[01:19:28.168 --> 01:19:32.151]  I mean, I have two people that work for me that live in England.
[01:19:32.151 --> 01:19:34.213]  Okay, they're coming here for healthcare.
[01:19:34.213 --> 01:19:35.714]  Canadians come here.
[01:19:35.714 --> 01:19:38.076]  I watch the House of Commons on C-SPAN.
[01:19:38.076 --> 01:19:43.581]  They do make you wait 18 months for brain surgery when, if you don't get it in two months, you die.
[01:19:43.581 --> 01:19:44.862]  I've seen Tony Blair admit that.
[01:19:46.454 --> 01:19:48.637]  It isn't rhetoric, okay?
[01:19:48.637 --> 01:19:50.300]  We need government out of healthcare.
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:52.643]  Government has screwed up healthcare.
[01:19:52.643 --> 01:19:58.872]  The welfare state has brought the 30 million illegal ins to suck off the rest of this thing.
[01:19:58.872 --> 01:19:59.693]  I'm sick of it!
[01:20:01.405 --> 01:20:08.667]  Attention landscapers, house painters, carpet cleaners, pet sitters, gutter cleaners, and anyone who has their own home service business.

[01:20:32.679 --> 01:20:37.664]  Corporate America is destroying our country and it's time to rebuild the backbone of America.

[01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:07.434]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.434 --> 01:21:15.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.165]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:23.566]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:23.566 --> 01:21:26.067]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:26.067 --> 01:21:37.631]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:21:37.631 --> 01:21:39.311]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:41.172]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:41.172 --> 01:21:47.394]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:57.935]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.935 --> 01:21:59.116]  The people strike back!
[01:22:00.876 --> 01:22:01.657]  Gold.
[01:22:01.657 --> 01:22:03.197]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:22:03.197 --> 01:22:09.481]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:22:09.481 --> 01:22:13.664]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:13.664 --> 01:22:15.605]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:15.605 --> 01:22:18.026]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:18.026 --> 01:22:20.668]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold.
[01:22:20.708 --> 01:22:21.449]  We're good to go.
[01:22:41.988 --> 01:22:42.308]  We're good.
[01:23:00.379 --> 01:23:07.087]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:23:07.087 --> 01:23:08.769]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:23:08.769 --> 01:23:13.354]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:23:13.354 --> 01:23:15.096]  But because this is not a cigarette,
[01:23:15.236 --> 01:23:21.000]  You don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.884]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire and has no dangerous secondhand smoke.
[01:23:25.884 --> 01:23:31.848]  So it's safe for the people around you and will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.
[01:23:32.128 --> 01:23:35.829]  So, get rid of the ashtrays, the smell, and the smoke.

[01:24:26.214 --> 01:24:31.337]  Next hour, I'm going to break down the total takeover of our economy by offshore banks.
[01:24:32.315 --> 01:24:44.845]  Through the next part of Obama's agenda, the banker reorganization bill, the financial reform bill.
[01:24:44.845 --> 01:24:48.428]  Notice how I told you they'd phrase it, oh look, we fixed the economy.
[01:24:48.428 --> 01:24:57.015]  It's a jobless recovery, record job losses, home prices plunging, factories shutting down, but big banks are showing record profits.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:02.823]  Off all the money they've stolen, so our economy's better.
[01:25:02.823 --> 01:25:09.628]  And if you don't give us this new takeover power, the whole economy's gonna die.
[01:25:09.628 --> 01:25:11.429]  It's very elementary.
[01:25:11.429 --> 01:25:15.533]  And so now, in the fall, it'll be part two of what we saw last October.
[01:25:15.533 --> 01:25:21.477]  You don't give them the total banking takeover power, they're gonna come in and drop the stock market by 2,000 points.
[01:25:24.246 --> 01:25:32.854]  And then they're just going to keep doing it until we wake up homeless on the continent our forefathers conquered, in the words of Thomas Jefferson.
[01:25:32.854 --> 01:25:35.396]  Going back to Kevin in Mass.
[01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:37.217]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[01:25:37.217 --> 01:25:38.038]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:25:38.038 --> 01:25:40.480]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.402]  That last caller was a bit over the top.
[01:25:42.402 --> 01:25:46.265]  I mean, the guy doesn't understand the difference between rhetoric and reality.
[01:25:46.265 --> 01:25:48.647]  But two things I did want to mention to you.
[01:25:48.647 --> 01:25:50.429]  Number one, I was listening to you yesterday.
[01:25:51.198 --> 01:25:56.285]  And prior to listening to you, I downloaded two articles on the Tea Party stuff going on in D.C.
[01:25:56.285 --> 01:26:00.229]  One was the Wall Street Journal, which said tens of thousands of people.
[01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:04.435]  The next one I downloaded was the British paper, the Daily Mail.
[01:26:04.435 --> 01:26:07.138]  And bang, they said two million.
[01:26:07.138 --> 01:26:09.902]  If you want to see an illustration of press distortion, there it is.
[01:26:11.681 --> 01:26:12.582]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:26:12.582 --> 01:26:16.086]  The Wall Street Journal, and I did see that, went with the same party line.
[01:26:16.086 --> 01:26:26.116]  New York Times said thousands, and that part of them were Obama supporters, total distortion, as if it was two groups out there, when it clearly wasn't.
[01:26:26.116 --> 01:26:31.722]  I mean, maybe 1 out of 100, 1 out of 20, who knows, but it was a very small minority for government-run healthcare.
[01:26:33.194 --> 01:26:42.040]  And look at that distortion when the Park Service and Homeland Security said upwards of two million, our own media just can't get it right.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:51.846]  So see, even the Wall Street Journal is trying to dampen the grassroots movement because the big banks, the big money, they all have piled on
[01:26:52.526 --> 01:26:53.586]  I agree with you 100%.
[01:27:18.012 --> 01:27:23.975]  And point two here Alex, I listened to an interview the other day and it looks like it's disappeared into the rat hole.
[01:27:23.975 --> 01:27:28.757]  And that was, I listened to Trafficant, Jim Trafficant, the other night with Greta Van Susteren.
[01:27:28.757 --> 01:27:31.098]  And he basically took a shot at AIPAC.
[01:27:31.098 --> 01:27:33.639]  So I think we're never going to probably hear from him again.
[01:27:33.639 --> 01:27:34.859]  But I was kind of surprised.
[01:27:34.859 --> 01:27:35.980]  Did you see that interview?
[01:27:37.529 --> 01:27:40.851]  I have been really busy launching the whole 9-11 Charlie Sheen thing.
[01:27:40.851 --> 01:27:42.332]  I have been really busy with everything else.
[01:27:42.332 --> 01:27:51.136]  I finally, last night, after the show, at like 9 o'clock at night, one of the guys said, have you seen this?
[01:27:51.136 --> 01:27:55.599]  And I walked over and watched it and that was on my list.
[01:27:55.599 --> 01:27:59.181]  In fact, will you pull that, it was like two parts, wasn't it?
[01:27:59.181 --> 01:28:03.423]  Pull that up because I want to play parts of that later, the James Traficant.
[01:28:04.997 --> 01:28:07.739]  Will knows, Will's the one that showed it to me.
[01:28:07.739 --> 01:28:10.522]  So who's, ask him, he's in the other, yeah.
[01:28:10.522 --> 01:28:14.005]  Yes sir, I did see that last night, go ahead.
[01:28:14.005 --> 01:28:25.795]  Okay, well hey, excellent Alex, I thought he brought us some good points, and like I said, I noticed, like I've been all over the place, and I've seen virtually no further, no mention of it whatsoever since he gave it, and like, I'll finish up with this thought.
[01:28:25.795 --> 01:28:30.739]  I believe the mainstream media, the corporate media, whatever you want to call them, Fox, I call the controlled opposition,
[01:28:31.471 --> 01:28:33.752]  Um, basically they do a disappearing thing.
[01:28:33.752 --> 01:28:41.195]  I remember, like, Pat Buchanan largely has run afoul of certain interest groups, and we don't hear anywhere near as much from him as we did, say, 15 years ago.
[01:28:41.195 --> 01:28:45.316]  And I'm just kind of curious if they're going to do the disappearing act on Jim Traficanton.
[01:28:45.316 --> 01:28:47.437]  And with that, Alex, I want to thank you very much for taking my call.
[01:28:48.388 --> 01:28:49.309]  Absolutely.
[01:28:49.309 --> 01:28:50.630]  Well, I want to be clear.
[01:28:50.630 --> 01:28:52.831]  Pat Buchanan worked for Nixon.
[01:28:52.831 --> 01:28:55.613]  I've seen him do some baiting and switching.
[01:28:55.613 --> 01:29:01.218]  You know, becoming pro-war briefly in 2003, when he knew it was political suicide to be against it.
[01:29:01.218 --> 01:29:04.220]  Then he came out against it later.
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:06.462]  But Pat Buchanan is a lot better than Glenn Beck.
[01:29:06.462 --> 01:29:13.467]  I mean, Pat Buchanan actually believes a lot of what he's saying, and then plays politics a little.
[01:29:13.467 --> 01:29:15.829]  With Glenn Beck, it's all done on purpose.
[01:29:15.829 --> 01:29:17.370]  To be manipulative and deceptive,
[01:29:18.727 --> 01:29:22.071]  And it's right out of the government playbook and he's dangerous.
[01:29:22.071 --> 01:29:22.712]  He's dangerous.
[01:29:22.712 --> 01:29:30.301]  So I'm going to talk about that when we get back on a host of issues, but I'm going to try to reach out to him straight ahead after this break.
[01:29:31.411 --> 01:29:34.872]  And I've been getting emails saying, why haven't you had James Traficant on?
[01:29:34.872 --> 01:29:38.313]  We've been calling James Traficant for two weeks since he got out of prison.
[01:29:38.313 --> 01:29:46.496]  Paul Hartman and Jaron have talked to his wife over and over again, and she keeps very nicely saying, I'm giving Jim your message.
[01:29:46.496 --> 01:29:48.837]  So, we're trying to get Traficant on.
[01:29:48.837 --> 01:29:51.078]  We were against him going to prison.
[01:29:51.078 --> 01:29:52.478]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.478 --> 01:29:55.019]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.019 --> 01:29:57.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.274 --> 01:30:04.276]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.276 --> 01:30:09.621]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.621 --> 01:30:11.662]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.662 --> 01:30:16.666]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.666 --> 01:30:17.567]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.847 --> 01:30:18.968]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.968 --> 01:30:20.850]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:21.910]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:24.112]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.112 --> 01:30:25.453]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:26.995]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.995 --> 01:30:32.259]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.259 --> 01:30:35.842]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.842 --> 01:30:39.305]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.665 --> 01:30:40.886]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.886 --> 01:30:41.787]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.787 --> 01:30:42.888]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.888 --> 01:30:43.829]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.829 --> 01:30:44.910]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:47.973]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:30:49.755 --> 01:30:50.655]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.273 --> 01:31:05.580]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:10.126]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.126 --> 01:31:12.389]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.389 --> 01:31:14.011]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:14.011 --> 01:31:15.053]  There is a solution.

[01:32:03.450 --> 01:32:06.394]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[01:32:06.394 --> 01:32:08.636]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[01:32:08.636 --> 01:32:09.637]  Here's the story.
[01:32:09.637 --> 01:32:14.423]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[01:32:14.423 --> 01:32:15.684]  Now here's the bad news.
[01:32:15.684 --> 01:32:18.868]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands.
[01:32:19.108 --> 01:32:19.508]  We're good to go.
[01:32:44.176 --> 01:32:49.361]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies, and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[01:32:49.361 --> 01:32:53.485]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:56.268]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com, or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[01:33:15.696 --> 01:33:28.984]  And I started out of town, yeah All of a sudden I saw Sherrif Don Brown Came in to shoot me down So I shot, I shot, I shot him down And I say If I am guilty
[01:33:45.282 --> 01:33:57.109]  I'm going to speak about the Glenn Beck situation and reach out to him in just a moment.
[01:33:57.109 --> 01:34:06.514]  There's a lot of videos online made by real conservatives and libertarians about how disingenuous Glenn Beck is.
[01:34:06.514 --> 01:34:11.017]  But one I saw last week really boiled it down well, demonizing Ron Paul,
[01:34:13.032 --> 01:34:18.635]  Pushing for the banker bailout takeover bill, which he now claims he's against.
[01:34:18.635 --> 01:34:22.497]  And just other disingenuous things he's done.
[01:34:22.497 --> 01:34:29.820]  So I think this sets the stage for some of you that may not remember all of his deception for what I'm going to cover when we come back.
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:31.261]  But here's the video.
[01:34:31.261 --> 01:34:34.943]  Glenn Beck is a neocon, not a libertarian.
[01:34:40.831 --> 01:34:44.276]  I'm a dope, I'm a rodeo clown, I'm a recovering alcoholic!
[01:34:49.358 --> 01:34:52.079]  I believe so deeply in our Constitution.
[01:34:52.079 --> 01:34:54.159]  I was for the Patriot Act.
[01:34:54.159 --> 01:34:57.080]  You know that I am actually a libertarian at heart.
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.101]  I think the bailout is the right thing to do.
[01:34:59.101 --> 01:35:02.141]  I believe so deeply in our Constitution.
[01:35:02.141 --> 01:35:03.802]  I was for the Patriot Act.
[01:35:03.802 --> 01:35:07.703]  You know that I am actually a libertarian at heart.
[01:35:07.703 --> 01:35:15.925]  The 700 billion dollars that you're hearing about now is not only, I believe, necessary, it is also not nearly enough.
[01:35:15.925 --> 01:35:18.826]  There was one guy last year that was Ron Paul.
[01:35:22.182 --> 01:35:26.557]  When you were on CNN, you would act like he was kind of crazy kooky guy.
[01:35:26.557 --> 01:35:28.804]  And I still act like he's crazy kooky guy.
[01:35:30.785 --> 01:35:32.146]  The Ron Paul Revolution.
[01:35:32.146 --> 01:35:39.153]  I think it's meant to be a catchy slogan, but I fear some of his fringe supporters are taking the word revolution too literally.
[01:35:39.153 --> 01:35:45.418]  Hey Glenn, real quick, how did you and your network benefit from associating Ron Paul supporters with domestic terrorism?
[01:35:45.418 --> 01:35:52.645]  When you were escorted out after asking him your question, Glenn Beck stopped, turned to the crowd, and started applauding.
[01:35:52.645 --> 01:35:56.768]  What you're about to hear is the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment.
[01:35:57.610 --> 01:35:59.178]  This is the Glenn Beck Program.
[01:36:03.041 --> 01:36:06.863]  The man has total credence when it comes to the economy.
[01:36:06.863 --> 01:36:11.286]  The man does not necessarily have credence when it comes to the war on terror.
[01:36:11.286 --> 01:36:16.649]  And Tim there suggests that we think of the economy, but not in foreign policy.
[01:36:16.649 --> 01:36:18.230]  You can't do that.
[01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:19.070]  They're one and the same.
[01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:20.871]  That's where all the money's going.
[01:36:20.871 --> 01:36:25.854]  Have you seen any of the stuff that Glenn Beck has been doing?
[01:36:25.854 --> 01:36:30.057]  He is, on occasion, a demagogue.
[01:36:30.057 --> 01:36:32.158]  Religious fanatics that are decapitating
[01:36:33.044 --> 01:36:37.050]  Does Hitler come to mind for the love of our children?
[01:36:37.050 --> 01:36:39.654]  And they are preparing a holocaust.
[01:36:39.654 --> 01:36:41.517]  Uh, the second holocaust.
[01:36:41.517 --> 01:36:44.161]  He has been, uh, three disparities.
[01:36:44.161 --> 01:36:48.367]  What you're about to hear is the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment.
[01:36:49.421 --> 01:36:54.385]  Earlier today, I had the opportunity to sit down in the Oval Office with the President of the United States.
[01:36:54.385 --> 01:36:59.909]  President Bush is a man who personally feels the pain of every lost soldier.
[01:36:59.909 --> 01:37:03.712]  I can tell you that the President has incredible passion and resolve.
[01:37:03.712 --> 01:37:16.161]  Those weapons of mass destruction gotta be somewhere.
[01:37:16.161 --> 01:37:17.862]  That is the real story tonight.
[01:37:17.862 --> 01:37:18.383]  Back in a minute.
[01:37:20.996 --> 01:37:33.047]  All right ladies and gentlemen, I don't think Lou Dobbs is perfect, but I respect him and I think he's for real and believes in what he's doing.
[01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:42.555]  I understand that Pat Buchanan sometimes plays politics, is suddenly pro-war and then against the war, but he's not there to be
[01:37:44.907 --> 01:37:56.778]  A controlled opposition meant to be a Pied Piper to lead the Patriot movement astray.
[01:37:56.778 --> 01:38:04.365]  And that's the issue with Glenn Beck is that I know his history and I've seen the dangerous
[01:38:05.623 --> 01:38:30.146]  dangerous scripts that he's reading from over the last two two-and-a-half years as coming directly from the bowels of the pentagon and the psyop machine and that is what concerns me so much about glenn beck is that he is clearly being
[01:38:31.237 --> 01:38:36.319]  He is being set up as the leader of the opposition against all things Obama.
[01:38:48.817 --> 01:38:54.601]  So that he can lead the opposition astray when the time comes.
[01:38:54.601 --> 01:38:59.585]  And we know that's the case because he's done that time and time again in the past.
[01:38:59.585 --> 01:39:01.006]  The establishment isn't stupid.
[01:39:01.006 --> 01:39:04.549]  They know that government takeover of healthcare is going to be unpopular.
[01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:24.254]  They know that youth brigades and National Compulsory Service, which has been introduced as legislation and called for by the White House Chief of Staff and called for by the President, compulsory service in a new domestic military.
[01:39:24.254 --> 01:39:26.155]  They know that's going to be unpopular.
[01:39:26.155 --> 01:39:31.076]  So they are putting Glenn Beck up there as the leader of that opposition
[01:39:32.674 --> 01:39:35.977]  So that at key points, he can lead people astray.
[01:39:35.977 --> 01:39:39.019]  But, I'm going to go over the evidence of that in a moment.
[01:39:39.019 --> 01:39:42.142]  I first want to speak to Glenn Beck.
[01:39:42.142 --> 01:39:47.005]  Glenn Beck, you brag that you've got a $50 million contract.
[01:39:47.005 --> 01:39:48.587]  And I think that's great for you.
[01:39:48.587 --> 01:39:48.947]  Wonderful.
[01:39:50.202 --> 01:39:51.523]  And I want to be clear here.
[01:39:51.523 --> 01:39:57.145]  I'm not attacking you because you're well-known on TV and because you have a big paycheck.
[01:39:57.145 --> 01:40:00.627]  You are a very talented radio host.
[01:40:00.627 --> 01:40:05.269]  I don't know how you do three hours a day and then go get ready for that big TV show.
[01:40:05.269 --> 01:40:08.030]  I mean, I know it must be exhausting.
[01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:11.612]  And you pull it off very well and I admire your talent.
[01:40:12.995 --> 01:40:24.304]  But being somewhat of a novice of history, I also admire the talent of Benedict Arnold, one of our better generals in the Revolutionary War.
[01:40:24.304 --> 01:40:29.328]  And I don't attack people lightly.
[01:40:29.328 --> 01:40:37.074]  Even though I disagree with a lot of things Michael Savage does, I defend his right to say it, and when he was getting censored, I stood up for him.
[01:40:37.074 --> 01:40:41.518]  When Van Jones was calling for your firing, Glenn, I stood up for you.
[01:40:43.407 --> 01:40:48.688]  When people have tried to pull down Rush Limbaugh as a symbol of free speech talk radio.
[01:40:48.688 --> 01:40:51.788]  I've defended Limbaugh.
[01:40:51.788 --> 01:41:00.670]  Even though I know he's a drug-addled, arrogant deceiver who has led conservatives astray.
[01:41:00.670 --> 01:41:03.210]  Because I understand the part you're playing.
[01:41:03.210 --> 01:41:06.831]  You're meant to discredit true conservatism and libertarianism.
[01:41:06.831 --> 01:41:11.692]  And you're meant to be a ringer in this fight as the global corporate state
[01:41:12.794 --> 01:41:19.177]  Socializes the wealth in this country so they can more easily extract it offshore.
[01:41:19.177 --> 01:41:22.238]  But Glenn, I want to talk directly to you right now.
[01:41:22.238 --> 01:41:30.021]  And I want to tell you that history is what matters and being on the right side of history is what is important.
[01:41:30.021 --> 01:41:38.304]  And you don't want your grandchildren and great-grandchildren to look back on you as a Benedict Arnold, as a traitor.
[01:41:38.304 --> 01:41:42.166]  You don't want people to look back on you as a media whore.
[01:41:43.823 --> 01:41:51.008]  You don't want people to look back on what you're doing now as being loyal opposition.
[01:41:51.008 --> 01:41:54.831]  I understand you were hired because you're a slick presenter.
[01:41:54.831 --> 01:42:12.963]  I understand you were hired because of your slick dual message to discredit and polarize the conservative movement for the left, to dress up in lederhosen and clearly fake cry and then admit you're fake crying to further convince the left that the right is insane.
[01:42:15.287 --> 01:42:30.920]  But at the same time, you are there to lead conservatives and libertarians and people that were waking up from my show and waking up to the full global system, the world government, the New World Order.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:33.722]  You're meant to talk about just enough of that.
[01:42:35.356 --> 01:42:52.247]  To get them to then feel like their revolutionary energies against this tyranny are being expressed so they spend their time and energy on your 9-12 project instead of really going out and taking this country back.
[01:42:52.247 --> 01:43:02.834]  Your whole 9-12 project is about remembering 9-12 and remembering the police state and how good the Patriot Act is and remembering how giving up our liberties is good.
[01:43:04.255 --> 01:43:13.757]  And remembering how good it was to believe the lie that Saddam had WMDs and yellow cake.
[01:43:13.757 --> 01:43:19.598]  It's about following that neocon agenda, which Obama is continuing.
[01:43:19.598 --> 01:43:23.559]  You know, Glenn Beck attacks Obama and says he's pulling our troops out of the Middle East.
[01:43:23.559 --> 01:43:26.799]  He wants Al Qaeda to attack us, giving him left cover.
[01:43:26.799 --> 01:43:30.140]  The truth is, Obama has taken 50,000
[01:43:32.526 --> 01:43:46.332]  troops out of Iraq and moved them to Afghanistan and then move 50,000 plus more contractors into Iraq, boosting the total number of troops.
[01:43:46.332 --> 01:43:49.574]  So when you come out and call him a communist, he's not a communist.
[01:43:49.574 --> 01:43:51.675]  He got four times the money John McCain did.
[01:43:52.495 --> 01:43:54.516]  Because John McCain wasn't the heir apparent.
[01:43:54.516 --> 01:43:58.799]  He wasn't the corporate slick Harvard person.
[01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:01.140]  And I'm not saying vote for John McCain.
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:03.022]  I'm saying we didn't really have a choice.
[01:44:03.022 --> 01:44:07.464]  The media hyped Coca-Cola president.
[01:44:07.464 --> 01:44:14.929]  The media president was Barack H. Obama.
[01:44:14.929 --> 01:44:16.230]  And so he was the heir apparent.
[01:44:16.230 --> 01:44:17.691]  He is the corporate president.
[01:44:18.393 --> 01:44:24.136]  But see, Glenn Beck is meant to make conservatives not shift out of the left-right paradigm.
[01:44:24.136 --> 01:44:32.981]  He's meant to keep them in that paradigm and to see Obama as this big leftist, when really he's just a statist looting us for offshore banks.
[01:44:32.981 --> 01:44:39.885]  $23.7 trillion has been stolen by the bipartisan group under Bush and Obama to offshore banks.
[01:44:39.885 --> 01:44:46.989]  They're using that money to come in and buy up our economy and the smaller banks and insurance companies and credit unions.
[01:44:48.038 --> 01:45:06.594]  The new reform plan of Obama will give total dictatorial power to a new private board of banks over every part of our economy, from a hot dog stand, to a hair salon, to a factory, to a car dealership.
[01:45:06.594 --> 01:45:09.737]  And the truth is, a bipartisan group wants that power.
[01:45:12.699 --> 01:45:20.144]  Glenn Beck, we played the clip earlier of you saying we've got to support the banker bailout.
[01:45:20.144 --> 01:45:22.626]  Rush Limbaugh wasn't supporting it.
[01:45:22.626 --> 01:45:27.689]  Pat Buchanan wasn't supporting it.
[01:45:27.689 --> 01:45:29.591]  Lou Dobbs wasn't supporting it.
[01:45:29.591 --> 01:45:36.976]  Say what you want about them, 1,000 to 1 phone calls into Congress against that banker bailout.
[01:45:36.976 --> 01:45:40.218]  The polls, 99 plus percent against it.
[01:45:40.993 --> 01:45:44.678]  But you went on TV and supported it.
[01:45:44.678 --> 01:45:53.869]  And I predict you're going to end up, when they plunge the economy again in the next year, you're going to end up supporting Obama on the new Bank of the World.
[01:45:53.869 --> 01:45:59.797]  The new regulatory system over our currency, over the interest rates, and over our tax rates.
[01:46:03.163 --> 01:46:05.744]  I saw you read from the MIAC report.
[01:46:05.744 --> 01:46:08.385]  I'd seen earlier versions a year and a half ago.
[01:46:08.385 --> 01:46:10.045]  The DHS report.
[01:46:10.045 --> 01:46:18.448]  I said on air before that stuff was even public, I said he's reading from federal reports when he says, Ron Paul wants to bomb us with a money bomb.
[01:46:18.448 --> 01:46:19.568]  He's dangerous.
[01:46:19.568 --> 01:46:22.429]  His followers want to blow things up.
[01:46:22.429 --> 01:46:28.071]  Knowing full well money bomb meant a big effect in the info war, a term I coined.
[01:46:30.942 --> 01:46:32.082]  You knew what that meant.
[01:46:32.082 --> 01:46:40.644]  When Ron Paul had a real chance of winning, and when the media did hit pieces on him, you waded in with the most vicious attacks.
[01:46:40.644 --> 01:46:45.605]  You are controlled opposition, and you're to ensure those Tea Parties are under control.
[01:46:45.605 --> 01:46:56.888]  Those Tea Parties started with 9-11 Truth six years ago in Boston, and then the current political type started two years ago in Austin, Texas, against the banker Takeover.
[01:46:58.618 --> 01:47:00.098]  Almost two years ago.
[01:47:00.098 --> 01:47:02.339]  A year and nine months ago.
[01:47:02.339 --> 01:47:05.620]  That happened with 9-11 Truth and We Are Changing Austin.
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:11.721]  And he came in and he co-opted that entire thing.
[01:47:11.721 --> 01:47:15.962]  Glenn Beck, I'm here to tell you, you're not fulfilled.
[01:47:15.962 --> 01:47:17.923]  I look in your eyes, you're not a happy person.
[01:47:20.484 --> 01:47:26.926]  Because I know you were poor and ate ramen noodle and were an alcoholic and lived in a cockroach apartment, like you tell people.
[01:47:26.926 --> 01:47:30.928]  And then now you got $50 million and $10 million from your book and all this.
[01:47:30.928 --> 01:47:33.189]  Great, man!
[01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:38.851]  But you even admit you almost died a year ago from an ailment.
[01:47:38.851 --> 01:47:48.014]  Really, wouldn't you rather at the end of your life, whenever that comes, next year or 30 years from now, be able to sit back and really know that you stood up for liberty and freedom?
[01:47:50.094 --> 01:47:55.316]  Isn't that more valuable than $50 million?
[01:47:55.316 --> 01:47:59.138]  I mean, once you got a few million, isn't that enough for you to be comfortable?
[01:47:59.138 --> 01:48:09.683]  But see, it's about the status, and it's about being a winner, and it's about being competitive, and it's about showing all those people that didn't believe in you that you are a success.
[01:48:09.683 --> 01:48:11.624]  I understand that.
[01:48:11.624 --> 01:48:14.965]  I understand that.
[01:48:14.965 --> 01:48:18.187]  I understand the road to the dark side, being overly competitive.
[01:48:20.097 --> 01:48:33.160]  When I was approached ten years ago to sell out and be what you are today, the new Rush Limbaugh, but no private Federal Reserve, no New World Order was to be talked about, I was told you could be a star or be on this crusade that's going nowhere.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:37.841]  I chose the crusade and I thank God every day I did the right thing.
[01:48:37.841 --> 01:48:40.362]  Glenn, I know you signed a contract.
[01:48:40.362 --> 01:48:43.142]  I know the stuff's written for you on the teleprompter.
[01:48:43.142 --> 01:48:45.563]  I know this is a Pentagon psyop.
[01:48:46.579 --> 01:48:52.663]  I knew what you do with the concentration camps right down to what fake camp you would show as a straw man.
[01:48:52.663 --> 01:48:53.664]  I know you.
[01:48:53.664 --> 01:48:56.906]  I study the people controlling you.
[01:48:56.906 --> 01:49:01.229]  And you are smart enough to know they plan on destroying you in the end.
[01:49:01.229 --> 01:49:07.173]  You're smart enough to know that they're going to build you up and then destroy you in the end.
[01:49:07.173 --> 01:49:09.335]  That's their plan.
[01:49:09.335 --> 01:49:11.096]  You're even a willing participant in it.
[01:49:11.096 --> 01:49:12.357]  Then they'll build you up again later.
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.642]  Glenn, think twice about what you're doing.
[01:49:18.642 --> 01:49:22.445]  Think twice about what you're a part of right now.
[01:49:22.445 --> 01:49:27.408]  I'm not asking you because I know you can't go all the way to be a real patriot like Judge Napolitano.
[01:49:27.408 --> 01:49:28.969]  That's why you keep him in the basement.
[01:49:28.969 --> 01:49:31.090]  He comes out once a month on your show.
[01:49:31.090 --> 01:49:32.751]  That's why he's on the internet.
[01:49:32.751 --> 01:49:36.594]  And then they use Brian on there to be the frothing neocon as the counterbalance.
[01:49:39.505 --> 01:49:41.046]  Judge Napolitano tells the truth.
[01:49:41.046 --> 01:49:44.448]  This banking takeover is a complete takeover of our whole economy.
[01:49:44.448 --> 01:49:47.189]  Why don't you have him on more?
[01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:51.672]  Why don't you at least not enthusiastically attack Ron Paul when the time comes?
[01:49:51.672 --> 01:49:59.937]  Because I know right now you're acting like you're buddy-buddy so you have everybody on your side so you can stab them in the back later.
[01:49:59.937 --> 01:50:02.838]  I know that's the game some big talk show hosts play with me.
[01:50:02.838 --> 01:50:06.120]  Wasn't more than yesterday.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:07.481]  But the issue here is
[01:50:09.938 --> 01:50:16.943]  Just try to do whatever you can to redeem yourself, and don't be a Benedict Arnold in the end.
[01:50:16.943 --> 01:50:25.170]  We're going to write a more detailed letter to you, showing all the bad things you've done, and then showing you these tens of millions of people that are counting on you.
[01:50:25.170 --> 01:50:26.991]  You are now the leader.
[01:50:26.991 --> 01:50:28.992]  And I know it's all a big joke.
[01:50:28.992 --> 01:50:34.657]  You see it as hurting and managing these people, but they've got their trust in you.
[01:50:36.152 --> 01:50:42.633]  And I know you work for Fox News, I know you work for News Corp, and I know that you signed the contract.
[01:50:42.633 --> 01:50:48.435]  But just don't do it with so much enjoyment in your eyes when you mislead people.
[01:50:48.435 --> 01:50:52.796]  And just do what you can to not be pure evil.
[01:50:52.796 --> 01:50:59.277]  Because I look at you, I study you, I think you're a talented actor, and I want you to really think twice about what you're doing.
[01:51:01.229 --> 01:51:03.130]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:51:03.130 --> 01:51:05.812]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:51:05.812 --> 01:51:08.474]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:51:08.474 --> 01:51:09.634]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:51:09.634 --> 01:51:11.336]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:51:11.336 --> 01:51:14.237]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:51:14.237 --> 01:51:17.880]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:51:27.536 --> 01:51:33.691]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:51:33.691 --> 01:51:34.773]  An inside job.
[01:51:36.195 --> 01:51:40.218]  How dare you!
[01:51:40.218 --> 01:51:43.721]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:51:43.721 --> 01:51:46.403]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:51:46.403 --> 01:51:53.068]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:10.526]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[01:53:02.179 --> 01:53:06.482]  Food security from eFoodsDirect, the most valuable protection your family can have.
[01:53:06.482 --> 01:53:07.982]  It's a scary world we live in.
[01:53:07.982 --> 01:53:12.345]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[01:53:12.345 --> 01:53:16.027]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[01:53:16.027 --> 01:53:23.832]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[01:53:23.832 --> 01:53:27.794]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[01:53:27.794 --> 01:53:31.376]  And the solution for every one of these threats to your family is food security
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:34.340]  We're good to go!
[01:54:14.947 --> 01:54:31.634]  All the gold in the hills, all the palaces, all the power, all the fame, is nothing compared to being honorable, and being truthful, and standing up for the innocent.
[01:54:31.634 --> 01:54:37.116]  The crimes of this world government are legion.
[01:54:37.116 --> 01:54:42.158]  And if people really face the facts, there's no other choice but to resist this tyranny.
[01:54:44.266 --> 01:54:55.408]  Going back to the Glenn Beck situation, we're going to come back in the next hour and take calls and get into the whole financial reform takeover that is happening right now.
[01:54:55.408 --> 01:54:55.969]  It's simple.
[01:54:57.594 --> 01:55:25.481]  They know there's a massive revolution against world government, Open Bank of the World being set up, Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, liberal media, New York Times, said we were kooks, none of it existed, it wasn't real, there wasn't a plan for a carbon tax, we were insane, and then now they're announcing it all, after the financial implosion they engineered, just as we said, we were reading their own white papers that were published, going, please Rush Limbaugh, please Glenn Beck, read these,
[01:55:26.949 --> 01:55:30.210]  Now Glenn Beck can come out and say, I'm the opposition to this.
[01:55:30.210 --> 01:55:32.530]  Yes, it's a world government.
[01:55:32.530 --> 01:55:35.931]  And we beat it by passing the banker bailout.
[01:55:35.931 --> 01:55:39.511]  And we beat it by having the army go after Ron Paul supporters.
[01:55:39.511 --> 01:55:42.492]  They're calling for bombings.
[01:55:42.492 --> 01:55:46.852]  Glenn, you now have stepped into history.
[01:55:46.852 --> 01:55:50.973]  You're not just some pundit on Fox, you're leading the 9-12 movement.
[01:55:50.973 --> 01:55:55.374]  You claim you're anti-New World Order, while you openly are for the New World Order.
[01:55:58.775 --> 01:56:00.736]  A lot of people are wise to you.
[01:56:00.736 --> 01:56:05.939]  A lot of people are upset.
[01:56:05.939 --> 01:56:10.162]  And I'm just upset that we couldn't have somebody like you on our side.
[01:56:10.162 --> 01:56:14.544]  And to watch you treacherously stabbing people in the back is upsetting!
[01:56:14.544 --> 01:56:17.146]  I got three children, Glenn.
[01:56:17.146 --> 01:56:22.769]  I know you've got a family.
[01:56:22.769 --> 01:56:25.911]  And I know this, you're gonna be judged in this life for what you're doing, pal.
[01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:31.931]  You are one treacherous creature.
[01:56:31.931 --> 01:56:33.292]  And I want you to turn around.
[01:56:33.292 --> 01:56:37.953]  I want everybody to pray for Glenn Beck that God humbles him.
[01:56:37.953 --> 01:56:41.114]  I know God's humbled me, and I'm gonna try to be more humble.
[01:56:41.114 --> 01:56:44.055]  Because my discernment's much greater when I am humbled.
[01:56:44.055 --> 01:56:45.275]  None of us are perfect.
[01:56:45.275 --> 01:56:53.078]  The more I'm humbled, the more I realize it's wrong to viciously attack O'Reilly or Limbaugh or any of these people, because they're really just sad people.
[01:56:53.078 --> 01:56:56.479]  It's better just to talk about what they're doing that's wrong.
[01:56:56.479 --> 01:56:57.519]  I'm very sad for Glenn.
[01:56:59.497 --> 01:57:03.038]  But we can't just be sad for Glenn.
[01:57:03.038 --> 01:57:05.998]  When you go to these tea parties, you hand out the Obama deception.
[01:57:05.998 --> 01:57:08.539]  When you go to these tea parties, you hand out 9-11 truth.
[01:57:08.539 --> 01:57:18.540]  When you go to these tea parties, go burn on disc Glenn Beck being for the banker bailout and demonizing Ron Paul.
[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:27.302]  Because you mark my words, at key junctures, when we need him, and he's at the head of our movement, he's gonna stab us in the back.
[01:57:28.339 --> 01:57:29.819]  He's gonna hurt us.
[01:57:29.819 --> 01:57:31.480]  He's a Judas Iscariot.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:33.440]  He's a Benedict Arnold.
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:36.241]  And it's such a horrible position to be a Benedict Arnold.
[01:57:36.241 --> 01:57:39.582]  It's such a horrible position to be a Judas.
[01:57:39.582 --> 01:57:43.283]  It's the most horrible card you can draw in life.
[01:57:43.283 --> 01:57:45.383]  And those 30 pieces of silver, he's been paid.
[01:57:45.383 --> 01:57:50.524]  You know, in the time of Judas' day, 2009 years ago,
[01:57:54.147 --> 01:58:01.469]  You could buy a very nice house and live for a few decades on 20 ounces of silver.
[01:58:01.469 --> 01:58:07.510]  And so Glenn really got bought off for more like 10,000 pieces of silver.
[01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:14.892]  But just with my perspective, knowing what I know, how on God's green earth could you sell out for any amount of money?
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:18.101]  I mean, it's fine to have money and live comfortably.
[01:58:18.101 --> 01:58:19.161]  That's a good thing.
[01:58:19.161 --> 01:58:21.022]  I want everybody to be like that.
[01:58:21.022 --> 01:58:22.742]  I enjoy people doing well.
[01:58:22.742 --> 01:58:24.403]  It's not the wealth I'm concerned with.
[01:58:24.403 --> 01:58:26.724]  It's selling yourself out for the wealth.
[01:58:26.724 --> 01:58:31.725]  It's putting wealth at the top and doing it for that.
[01:58:31.725 --> 01:58:38.127]  It's just... I pity people like him, but we've gotta stay on Glenn Beck.
[01:58:38.127 --> 01:58:39.788]  We've gotta expose his lies.
[01:58:41.198 --> 01:58:46.870]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:50.077]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:50.609 --> 01:58:54.853]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.853 --> 01:58:56.854]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.854 --> 01:59:05.382]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.382 --> 01:59:10.926]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.926 --> 01:59:12.548]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.788 --> 01:59:19.314]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.314 --> 01:59:30.364]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.364 --> 01:59:31.125]  That's right.
[01:59:31.125 --> 01:59:33.707]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.707 --> 01:59:35.288]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:59:37.210 --> 01:59:38.830]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:39.171]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.647 --> 02:00:07.568]  I'm going to run through
[02:00:30.114 --> 02:00:33.755]  Your phone calls here in a moment for the next two segments.
[02:00:33.755 --> 02:00:37.877]  Then I'm going to spend the last 40 minutes of this hour detailing the banking takeover.
[02:00:37.877 --> 02:00:44.179]  I know I harped on this in January, February, March, April, May.
[02:00:44.179 --> 02:00:51.721]  Then they withdrew the financial reform plan and went for the health care takeover of 20% of the economy.
[02:00:51.721 --> 02:00:53.642]  But now they're back!
[02:00:53.642 --> 02:00:56.483]  And so we're going to go over this in great detail, but first I want to take your calls.
[02:00:57.890 --> 02:01:17.779]  In summation on Glenn Beck though, the very fact that the establishment has tried to put him at the head of the anti-New World Order, libertarian, true conservative, slash classical liberal movement, the awakening, people that the majority of the population that don't like left or right.
[02:01:17.779 --> 02:01:19.299]  I saw close-up photos.
[02:01:19.299 --> 02:01:24.802]  It was blacks, whites, Hispanics, liberals, conservatives, libertarians, anti-New World Order.
[02:01:26.289 --> 02:01:29.532]  Our Joker posters, Infowars.com.
[02:01:29.532 --> 02:01:32.754]  I'd say about a third of the people were our listeners.
[02:01:32.754 --> 02:01:39.239]  A third or more were Glenn Beck's people and the rest were just mainline Republicans and Libertarians.
[02:01:39.239 --> 02:01:42.302]  But they wouldn't be putting Glenn Beck out there as the leader.
[02:01:42.302 --> 02:01:53.811]  They wouldn't be playing this dangerous game of even trying to get at the head of this movement if they didn't know massive revolution and resistance was mounting to their New World Order.
[02:01:53.811 --> 02:01:55.352]  That's why they put a Judas Goat
[02:01:57.202 --> 02:02:16.493]  At the front of this, a Judas goat, for those that don't know, a lot of sheep operations that produce mutton don't just shear the sheep and sell their wool, they kill a large portion of them every year, particularly the younger, fatter, plumper, juicier ones.
[02:02:16.493 --> 02:02:19.135]  A certain amount get cut out for mutton.
[02:02:19.135 --> 02:02:20.676]  And the ram is the leader.
[02:02:23.573 --> 02:02:39.858]  And, you know, the male sheep, he is the leader, the Judas sheep, or the Judas goat in the case of goats, and he will lead the goats or the sheep into the pen for the slaughter, and he goes out the other end and the others don't.
[02:02:39.858 --> 02:02:52.302]  There's no doubt Glenn Beck's a Judas goat, and I just want to mark the chart, just like we're out on the ocean, and I'm marking a place I found submerged rocks, and I ran my boat over it, and I'm just putting a buoy out,
[02:02:53.319 --> 02:02:59.143]  It's and I'm marking the chart saying there is a big old rock one foot under the water.
[02:02:59.143 --> 02:03:04.526]  It's definitely a rock and watch out.
[02:03:04.526 --> 02:03:08.409]  And you can ignore me and drive your boat right over it.
[02:03:08.409 --> 02:03:10.770]  But and I'm not saying don't go to the tea parties.
[02:03:10.770 --> 02:03:14.352]  I'm not saying no go to them and take them over.
[02:03:14.352 --> 02:03:18.535]  Use their gamble to try to take over our movement to take over their movement.
[02:03:20.799 --> 02:03:25.940]  The problem is when Fox News with tens of millions of viewers got involved, they got control of it.
[02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:30.421]  And it's always been Pentagon-run.
[02:03:30.421 --> 02:03:34.062]  I mean, Glenn, you have talked about this briefly.
[02:03:34.062 --> 02:03:40.884]  About how the White House science czar called to put poisons in our water and sterilizes.
[02:03:40.884 --> 02:03:49.606]  But then you also get up on your TV show and said the DHS report was good, that there are right-wing extremists.
[02:03:51.044 --> 02:03:53.846]  You were apologetically in support of it.
[02:03:53.846 --> 02:04:09.354]  You were 60-40, 60% in support of the DHS and had milquetoast guests on that supported the DHS report saying veterans are the number one threat and gun owners are the number one threat to homeland security.
[02:04:09.354 --> 02:04:12.536]  So, just give us a break.
[02:04:12.536 --> 02:04:14.437]  I mean, I want to believe in you.
[02:04:14.437 --> 02:04:16.278]  I know Pat Buchanan isn't perfect.
[02:04:16.278 --> 02:04:18.639]  I know Lou Dobbs aren't perfect, but I'm not up here bashing them.
[02:04:21.272 --> 02:04:27.417]  I don't want to be associated with all those timid souls who attack anybody that puts their head up.
[02:04:27.417 --> 02:04:31.641]  With the people that have created a cottage industry just out of attacking me.
[02:04:31.641 --> 02:04:34.643]  I'm not asking folks to do that.
[02:04:34.643 --> 02:04:38.006]  To just go out and attack you and make stuff up about you.
[02:04:38.006 --> 02:04:40.168]  But for people to go, look at your record, pal!
[02:04:40.168 --> 02:04:43.391]  You supported the Banker Bailout when almost no one else did.
[02:04:44.625 --> 02:04:48.512]  You go to the White House over and over again to get marching orders from Bush!
[02:04:48.512 --> 02:04:50.595]  You attack 9-11 truth!
[02:04:50.595 --> 02:04:52.018]  And Glenn Beck's a smart guy, folks.
[02:04:52.018 --> 02:04:53.380]  He's been sent the evidence.
[02:04:53.380 --> 02:04:55.504]  He knows the FEMA camps are real.
[02:04:55.504 --> 02:04:57.627]  He knows 9-11's an inside job.
[02:04:58.627 --> 02:05:00.988]  Glenn, look at what you've done!
[02:05:00.988 --> 02:05:06.211]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:05:06.211 --> 02:05:10.234]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:10.234 --> 02:05:16.137]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:16.137 --> 02:05:21.200]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:21.700]  Number three,
[02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:28.408]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:05:28.408 --> 02:05:31.312]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:05:31.312 --> 02:05:35.837]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.837 --> 02:05:39.442]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:05:39.662 --> 02:05:45.407]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:05:45.407 --> 02:05:50.111]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:06:01.308 --> 02:06:04.311]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.311 --> 02:06:09.636]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.636 --> 02:06:11.698]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.698 --> 02:06:16.703]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.703 --> 02:06:17.604]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.864 --> 02:06:18.985]  When do you want it?
[02:06:18.985 --> 02:06:20.866]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.866 --> 02:06:21.947]  When will you need it?
[02:06:21.947 --> 02:06:24.148]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.148 --> 02:06:25.489]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.489 --> 02:06:27.010]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.010 --> 02:06:32.294]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.294 --> 02:06:35.876]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.876 --> 02:06:39.339]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.679 --> 02:06:40.900]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.900 --> 02:06:41.821]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.821 --> 02:06:42.921]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.921 --> 02:06:43.842]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.842 --> 02:06:44.943]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.943 --> 02:06:47.985]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:47.985 --> 02:06:49.766]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.766 --> 02:06:50.687]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:09.406]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:07:09.406 --> 02:07:13.910]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:19.074]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:07:19.074 --> 02:07:26.540]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:30.904]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[02:07:31.204 --> 02:07:37.228]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:07:37.228 --> 02:07:44.172]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[02:07:44.172 --> 02:07:49.655]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision dot com.
[02:07:49.655 --> 02:07:52.197]  That's A L K A Vision dot com.

[02:07:52.757 --> 02:07:52.997]  269-409-1776 today!
[02:08:05.942 --> 02:08:10.786]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[02:08:10.786 --> 02:08:12.367]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.367 --> 02:08:13.909]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.909 --> 02:08:18.112]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.112 --> 02:08:30.682]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.682 --> 02:08:34.546]  Why did I spend the last 30 minutes talking about Glenn Beck?
[02:08:35.615 --> 02:08:44.622]  Because, mark my words, he is at a key juncture and is a key man in the New World Order's plan in this country.
[02:08:44.622 --> 02:08:59.453]  He is getting your confidence so that when he betrays you, when he slits our collective throats, we won't struggle, but will look up at him like a Labrador Retriever when you slit his throat with sadness.
[02:08:59.453 --> 02:09:03.716]  Like our own father has just shot us between the eyes.
[02:09:07.352 --> 02:09:11.476]  And I just can't believe how gullible people are.
[02:09:11.476 --> 02:09:12.617]  Absolutely gullible.
[02:09:12.617 --> 02:09:17.561]  But that's just like people support Obama.
[02:09:17.561 --> 02:09:20.844]  It's the same cult of personality, same thing.
[02:09:20.844 --> 02:09:25.428]  He lies, he's disingenuous, it's obviously a corporate scam.
[02:09:25.428 --> 02:09:28.570]  The evidence is clear.
[02:09:28.570 --> 02:09:29.791]  It doesn't matter.
[02:09:29.791 --> 02:09:34.615]  They like being deceived because they've been raised, from the time they were in diapers,
[02:09:35.732 --> 02:09:40.073]  Sitting in front of television sets.
[02:09:40.073 --> 02:09:43.654]  Okay, let's take a bunch of phone calls and I'm going to get into what's happening with the economy.
[02:09:43.654 --> 02:09:45.434]  And this is very important, what's coming up.
[02:09:45.434 --> 02:09:47.115]  Please call your friends and family and neighbors.
[02:09:47.115 --> 02:09:48.135]  Tell them to tune in.
[02:09:48.135 --> 02:09:54.076]  Whether you're listening to us on the local AM and FM station, internet, global short waiver, satellite.
[02:09:54.076 --> 02:09:55.677]  WC in Texas.
[02:09:55.677 --> 02:09:57.617]  WC, you're on the air.
[02:09:57.617 --> 02:10:00.218]  Hey Mr. Jones, thanks for taking my call.
[02:10:00.218 --> 02:10:04.419]  Although, on the way you worded all that, there's no doubt that
[02:10:05.138 --> 02:10:07.039]  I don't see how he could not respond to that.
[02:10:07.039 --> 02:10:08.819]  It was very tastefully worded.
[02:10:08.819 --> 02:10:11.740]  I'd like to make three key points, if I may, sir.
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:21.604]  One, I'm sure you and your listeners know that they've just released the new Bin Laden phony baloney tape, so it's obvious they're going to still continue to try to ride that swayback dead horse.
[02:10:21.604 --> 02:10:23.884]  So we've got to guard ourselves against that.
[02:10:23.884 --> 02:10:31.367]  Two, as I was flipping back and forth this Saturday from watching the Cougars whip up on OSU, I tuned into the Glenn Beck deal.
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:34.961]  They showed a guy wearing a security response shirt.
[02:10:34.961 --> 02:10:37.782]  So I think that's really, really good.
[02:10:37.782 --> 02:10:46.886]  And thirdly, sir, I heard Glenn mention, and I mentioned it on your show last time I called in, about the black triangle over his shoulder.
[02:10:46.886 --> 02:10:49.187]  Well, he didn't speak to that specifically.
[02:10:49.187 --> 02:10:54.609]  He referred to the piece behind him at that desk, which is a red stripe with a flag.
[02:10:54.609 --> 02:10:58.170]  He said, quote, I wish I could take the damn thing down.
[02:10:58.170 --> 02:10:59.791]  So I think
[02:11:00.751 --> 02:11:05.573]  He is a very tormented man because nobody can cry on cue like that.
[02:11:05.573 --> 02:11:14.836]  He's obviously struggling with some demons and hopefully good energy will overcome the dark energy.
[02:11:14.836 --> 02:11:16.537]  I hear you and God bless you.
[02:11:16.537 --> 02:11:22.219]  Going back to your Bin Laden comment, that was one of our top stories I haven't even gotten to.
[02:11:22.219 --> 02:11:26.261]  Paul Watson's written a detailed report that's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:11:28.015 --> 02:11:41.141]  The Intel Center, the two directors of it, formerly worked for Rumsfeld at the Pentagon and the other one as the head of Black Ops Psychological Operations, PSIOPS, at the CIA.
[02:11:41.141 --> 02:11:53.946]  I mean, you've got two top spooks in psychological warfare running the Intel Center, and three years ago, Wired Magazine, at a big computer symposium, we'd already done this at our office,
[02:11:55.513 --> 02:11:56.154]  I don't know.
[02:12:15.805 --> 02:12:18.306]  Video Layer, but it wasn't.
[02:12:18.306 --> 02:12:30.991]  The Intel Center puts their name, their logo, in the same video format in the original layer with the Adam Goddard and Bin Laden tapes.
[02:12:30.991 --> 02:12:37.253]  Adam Goddard is the Pearlman, the former, well not the former, he's the grandson of the former head of the ADL.
[02:12:39.414 --> 02:12:43.038]  Who was arrested in Mosque repeatedly beating up Muslims.
[02:12:43.038 --> 02:12:44.460]  He hates Muslims so much.
[02:12:44.460 --> 02:12:46.842]  And they said, look kid, you want to get the Muslims?
[02:12:46.842 --> 02:12:48.544]  Become the face of Al Qaeda.
[02:12:48.544 --> 02:12:53.950]  Then we can go in there and blow the hell out of these people, take over their countries.
[02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:55.112]  You're going into black ops.
[02:12:57.028 --> 02:12:58.489]  And it's so despicable.
[02:12:58.489 --> 02:13:02.490]  And then the Intel Center arrogantly uploads these videos.
[02:13:02.490 --> 02:13:08.313]  And the new one, I haven't had time to blow it up and look at it, but we've done this in the past.
[02:13:08.313 --> 02:13:12.075]  But I don't have a certification or a degree in this, so we didn't run with it.
[02:13:12.075 --> 02:13:16.597]  But we were looking at these videos back when I was making Terror Storm three and a half years ago.
[02:13:16.597 --> 02:13:20.859]  And on the big screen Plasma TV, because we work with video, I blew it up.
[02:13:21.579 --> 02:13:23.140]  And I was going, look at that!
[02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:29.164]  You have the same pixel shapes and the same pixel distribution in those layers.
[02:13:29.164 --> 02:13:32.106]  That was put in at the same time.
[02:13:32.106 --> 02:13:34.527]  Because we work with video.
[02:13:34.527 --> 02:13:39.050]  We deal with trying to take web video and other things and make it look okay, blowing it up.
[02:13:39.050 --> 02:13:40.111]  We deal with this.
[02:13:41.263 --> 02:13:56.102]  And I could look at it and go, and then I do have tech guys that are experts on pixel shapes and uploads and downloads and conversions and what this does and what that does and this number and that number and we're there studying on a big plasma screen.
[02:13:57.296 --> 02:14:01.417]  looking at it and it's there's there's no video layers.
[02:14:01.417 --> 02:14:05.419]  When you blow video up, you see video layers if stuff's been added.
[02:14:05.419 --> 02:14:12.421]  When Fox News plays somebody else's video and puts their bottom third on there, it's crisp and clear.
[02:14:12.421 --> 02:14:17.302]  The other video has got a different pixel and it deals with the conversions.
[02:14:17.302 --> 02:14:18.503]  These are the same video.
[02:14:18.503 --> 02:14:21.864]  This thing is clear all the way across.
[02:14:21.864 --> 02:14:25.865]  But then Wired Magazine interviewed a top computer expert with degrees in this
[02:14:27.233 --> 02:14:31.256]  And he said, yeah, it's the same video layer.
[02:14:31.256 --> 02:14:35.838]  I mean, you think it's fun to go on the radio and stand up against these people?
[02:14:35.838 --> 02:14:39.961]  These are hardcore soldiers.
[02:14:39.961 --> 02:14:40.982]  They know what they're doing.
[02:14:40.982 --> 02:14:44.344]  These guys go to work every day knowing they're putting out fake Al-Qaeda videos.
[02:14:46.647 --> 02:14:47.987]  Fake Al Qaeda audio!
[02:14:47.987 --> 02:14:59.491]  They've gone mainly to audio because major universities and major computer scientists and major special effects experts from France to England to the United States and Canada were on the news saying that isn't bin Laden.
[02:14:59.491 --> 02:15:04.392]  Then they did a voice print of the real bin Laden, voice printed it on him, it wasn't him again.
[02:15:04.392 --> 02:15:08.993]  Then they had linguists listen, it wasn't even somebody from Saudi Arabia!
[02:15:08.993 --> 02:15:14.195]  It was someone from the West, Arab, from probably Jordan or Israel,
[02:15:14.955 --> 02:15:26.979]  It was, you know, that, that, for somebody that speaks Arabic as an expert linguist, they can tell that guy's from Texas, that guy's from Southern Alabama, that guy's from Northern California, that guy's from North Dakota.
[02:15:26.979 --> 02:15:28.880]  There's a whole specialty to this.
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:36.203]  Major university heads in Canada and France went and listened and said, yeah, not only is the Bin Laden not the same voice print,
[02:15:37.188 --> 02:15:41.671]  And clearly it wasn't even, it was a guy that weighed 100 pounds more with a bigger nose.
[02:15:41.671 --> 02:15:43.753]  It wasn't even the same dialect.
[02:15:43.753 --> 02:15:46.675]  It was an American.
[02:15:46.675 --> 02:15:54.240]  Somebody who had lived in the West, probably America, who was born in Israel or Jordan.
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:58.524]  I mean, this is creepy, folks!
[02:15:58.524 --> 02:15:59.504]  They really did it!
[02:15:59.504 --> 02:16:02.406]  The feds really carried out 9-11.
[02:16:02.406 --> 02:16:03.988]  You think I like messing with these people?
[02:16:04.793 --> 02:16:09.296]  But I never backed down from bullying in my life, folks, and you know, maybe I'm dumb.
[02:16:09.296 --> 02:16:15.360]  Maybe I should just go drink the tap water that the White House admits they're spiking with stuff to sterilize my family.
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:26.988]  Maybe I should just let my kids drink out of the number six plastics that they admit cause breast cancer and testicular cancer.
[02:16:26.988 --> 02:16:28.169]  I mean, what the hell?
[02:16:30.037 --> 02:16:32.740]  How in the world am I supposed to just sit here?
[02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:34.102]  You think I like all this?
[02:16:34.102 --> 02:16:36.505]  You think I like being the big leader fighting this?
[02:16:36.505 --> 02:16:39.388]  No, I'm way past that, folks.
[02:16:39.388 --> 02:16:43.233]  In the past, I did it because I love liberty at my foundation.
[02:16:43.233 --> 02:16:47.297]  But I also did it because I was arrogant and aggressive and have a lot of bravado.
[02:16:48.430 --> 02:16:55.156]  And also down the road, a lot of people tried to stop me from being successful, but I don't have any pleasure in being successful.
[02:16:55.156 --> 02:16:57.638]  I don't have any pleasure in being arrogant.
[02:16:57.638 --> 02:16:59.640]  All of that's basically gone now.
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:02.442]  And I'm a better man because of it.
[02:17:02.442 --> 02:17:04.924]  But you know why?
[02:17:04.924 --> 02:17:13.452]  Getting situated, getting familiar with death or imprisonment or torture will do that to you.
[02:17:15.339 --> 02:17:16.640]  But it's a great blessing.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:20.402]  I have stepped in to what it is to be a real man.
[02:17:20.402 --> 02:17:31.949]  I've stepped in to guarding the innocent, facing down the steamroller of the New World Order, and the point of no return was passed a decade ago for me, and I just thank God I'm in this position.
[02:17:31.949 --> 02:17:38.913]  But I'll tell all of you out there that have made it a cottage industry to attack me and lie about me and twist and distort.
[02:17:38.913 --> 02:17:41.415]  I love you, and I feel sorry for you.
[02:17:44.051 --> 02:17:52.198]  I hate the evil you're involved in, but I realize that it's part of the blight, the spiritual blight that's on our society.
[02:17:52.198 --> 02:18:02.007]  And I asked God in the last few months to just give me an answer or to comfort me against the lies, the distortions, the attacks, and now they don't even hurt me anymore.
[02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:04.409]  God healed my heart of that.
[02:18:04.409 --> 02:18:09.414]  It didn't hurt me much, but it made me kind of evil and aggressive and, you know, screw them.
[02:18:09.414 --> 02:18:10.775]  I didn't want to have that attitude.
[02:18:12.435 --> 02:18:16.017]  And I asked God to change my heart, and God has changed my heart.
[02:18:16.017 --> 02:18:22.161]  And given me something deeper and more true, but also more painful.
[02:18:22.161 --> 02:18:24.322]  I feel sorry for Glenn Beck.
[02:18:24.322 --> 02:18:26.063]  I feel sorry for Rush Limbaugh.
[02:18:26.063 --> 02:18:27.524]  I feel sorry for Barack Obama.
[02:18:27.524 --> 02:18:29.825]  I feel sorry for the people that lie about me.
[02:18:29.825 --> 02:18:37.870]  I feel sorry for Adam Gadahn, who knows he goes in and does videos posing as Al-Qaeda, and thinks that being involved in 9-11
[02:18:39.517 --> 02:18:42.099]  You know, with Israel and the U.S.
[02:18:42.099 --> 02:18:52.306]  is a good thing because in the end it'll help America beat the Muslims and the Muslims are evil and we have to get America and Israel's heads screwed on straight to face this and all this crap.
[02:18:52.306 --> 02:18:59.851]  In justifies the means Machiavellian bull.
[02:18:59.851 --> 02:19:01.813]  I just am sad for our species.
[02:19:01.813 --> 02:19:04.635]  I just want something better for our species as a whole.
[02:19:12.824 --> 02:19:14.865]  But the good news is the people are waking up.
[02:19:14.865 --> 02:19:17.246]  Paul Watson's got an article up right now.
[02:19:17.246 --> 02:19:18.087]  Scientific poll.
[02:19:18.087 --> 02:19:21.489]  29% of Americans trust mainstream media.
[02:19:21.489 --> 02:19:24.690]  That's a key report from Paul Watson.
[02:19:24.690 --> 02:19:25.711]  And I said I'd take calls.
[02:19:25.711 --> 02:19:31.154]  We're just going to take calls until I'm done with at least George, Kevin, Dave, Sandy, and Chris.
[02:19:31.154 --> 02:19:32.715]  I'm going to try to go to you quickly.
[02:19:32.715 --> 02:19:34.916]  Then I'm going to cover the financial news.
[02:19:34.916 --> 02:19:36.417]  By probably 45 after or so.
[02:19:36.417 --> 02:19:38.498]  It's the most important news of the day.
[02:19:38.498 --> 02:19:40.419]  But you got me off on that whole Bin Laden thing.
[02:19:41.564 --> 02:19:45.288]  God, think of the Special Forces guys they had below those towers.
[02:19:45.288 --> 02:19:53.937]  They really... They really burned their souls up on that day.
[02:19:53.937 --> 02:19:58.162]  And it's painful to see people destroying their spiritual futures.
[02:20:11.971 --> 02:20:12.511]  I think so.
[02:20:32.506 --> 02:20:33.107]  We're good to go.
[02:21:01.485 --> 02:21:02.906]  It is a big idea.
[02:21:02.906 --> 02:21:05.728]  A New World Order.
[02:21:05.728 --> 02:21:10.230]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:13.452]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:21:13.452 --> 02:21:16.234]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[02:21:16.234 --> 02:21:19.416]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:21:19.416 --> 02:21:26.760]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:21:29.775 --> 02:21:35.218]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:21:35.218 --> 02:21:39.080]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:41.641]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:21:41.641 --> 02:21:42.802]  Most people have no idea.
[02:21:42.802 --> 02:21:43.602]  They're not after money.
[02:21:43.602 --> 02:21:44.883]  They have all the money they need.
[02:21:44.883 --> 02:21:45.644]  They're after power.
[02:21:45.644 --> 02:21:47.004]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:23:01.129 --> 02:23:05.411]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:23:05.411 --> 02:23:08.672]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:23:08.672 --> 02:23:15.675]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy.
[02:23:15.675 --> 02:23:21.357]  If we the people do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost forever.
[02:23:21.357 --> 02:23:22.898]  Utopia Silver is known for
[02:23:23.058 --> 02:23:23.679]  We're good to go.

[02:24:37.026 --> 02:24:49.003]  Could the West be in Afghanistan and Iraq eight years later if it wasn't for Bin Laden tapes that are released from the CIA-run Intel Center publicly, doled out every anniversary?
[02:24:50.998 --> 02:24:52.158]  It's not working anymore.
[02:24:52.158 --> 02:24:59.020]  Even the Mail Online, usually a pretty conservative newspaper, has Osama Bin Laden been dead for seven years?
[02:24:59.020 --> 02:24:59.760]  And are the U.S.
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:04.661]  and Britain covering it up to continue the war on terror?
[02:25:04.661 --> 02:25:09.522]  We'll give you a close shot of that on the document cam for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:25:09.522 --> 02:25:11.983]  Let's go to George in Pennsylvania.
[02:25:11.983 --> 02:25:12.783]  George, you're on the air.
[02:25:13.581 --> 02:25:18.984]  Well, the three really important things, they'll all just take a minute.
[02:25:18.984 --> 02:25:22.886]  The H1N1 vaccine is going to be given out by private physicians.
[02:25:22.886 --> 02:25:30.649]  I think everybody should line up, go to their doctor, ask them to squirt it in the trash and record that they got it, just in case it comes to forced vaccination later.
[02:25:30.649 --> 02:25:31.009]  Number two,
[02:25:32.455 --> 02:25:34.036]  Went to the Cook Islands with my kids.
[02:25:34.036 --> 02:25:36.157]  There's only 20,000 people that live there.
[02:25:36.157 --> 02:25:39.840]  We talked with at least 1,000 people, and I don't think they're there.
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:51.827]  I think maybe the people that really have the big money may have been registered there because the Cook Islands was the last place in the world to have unnumbered bank accounts, and they're closing a loophole now.
[02:25:51.827 --> 02:25:53.548]  So they may have been registered there.
[02:25:53.548 --> 02:25:54.249]  They're not there.
[02:25:54.249 --> 02:25:55.890]  We searched everywhere.
[02:25:55.890 --> 02:25:56.290]  Number three.
[02:25:57.490 --> 02:26:04.472]  One of my kids got a book to read on the way, A History of the People of the United States, Volume 2, and it looks like it was written by you.
[02:26:04.472 --> 02:26:11.133]  It talks about banker control and banker takeover of the financial system and the Illuminati.
[02:26:11.133 --> 02:26:18.295]  It was written in 1897 and it was from the first parts of the country.
[02:26:18.295 --> 02:26:22.516]  Yeah, that was republished under the name The Coming Battle.
[02:26:23.496 --> 02:26:30.940]  The Treasury Department, when Jefferson took over, was questioning where the money had gone to.
[02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:37.403]  And interestingly, there was a fire just when they were getting ready to look into this, and the Treasury was consumed.
[02:26:37.403 --> 02:26:47.588]  Yeah, you give private interests the power to issue all the currency and credit they want, they're going to bankrupt everything and you're going to wake up homeless on the continent your forefathers conquered.
[02:26:48.387 --> 02:26:54.492]  I just wonder if this might give us an indication of where the next big attack might come for our country now.
[02:26:54.492 --> 02:26:55.473]  Oh yes, the terrorists.
[02:26:55.473 --> 02:26:56.514]  Well, they don't even need to do that!
[02:26:56.514 --> 02:26:59.937]  You know, back then, people would get mad so they'd burn down the records.
[02:26:59.937 --> 02:27:06.463]  Now, they just steal it right in front of us and say, if you don't like it, SWAT teams will come machine gun you and your family.
[02:27:06.463 --> 02:27:09.626]  And, uh, you know, they're using two different pincers.
[02:27:11.072 --> 02:27:17.656]  They're using the fake terror and the fake environmentalism to make humans the enemy, and so the state can capture us.
[02:27:17.656 --> 02:27:18.517]  I appreciate your call.
[02:27:18.517 --> 02:27:19.937]  Great points, George.
[02:27:19.937 --> 02:27:20.958]  Kevin in Canada.
[02:27:20.958 --> 02:27:22.999]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[02:27:22.999 --> 02:27:24.680]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:28.303]  Anyone that's been listening to you for a month knows that you're bipartisan.
[02:27:28.303 --> 02:27:32.465]  From American dictators to Obama deception, no one needs ten years to see that.
[02:27:32.465 --> 02:27:36.087]  If after ten years you don't know that, you're a lost cause.
[02:27:36.087 --> 02:27:40.030]  Anyone that does need to get a Prison Planet membership, though, that's
[02:27:40.885 --> 02:27:43.006]  The great thing that you guys have available.
[02:27:43.006 --> 02:28:01.753]  Yeah, I haven't plugged anything yet today because I just, I'm intending to totally get my mind off the videos and books and materials and not only are they great things to wake people up, that's how we fund our operation and our revenue has fallen way down the last few months because I just really don't plug things like I used to, so thanks for plugging it for me.
[02:28:01.753 --> 02:28:02.454]  No problem.
[02:28:02.454 --> 02:28:06.955]  My local newspaper has been carrying many articles linking the internet to teaching
[02:28:08.737 --> 02:28:11.838]  The criminals to be criminals, basically.
[02:28:11.838 --> 02:28:26.300]  Yeah, that's the new thing is that they demonize it and InfoWars and Jones Report on major government systems and private systems are listed as criminal knowledge, criminal skills websites where the browsers tell you not to go there.
[02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:27.300]  Yes.
[02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:33.441]  Yeah, they've got this ex-cop who's testifying that he learned how to be a biker on the internet.
[02:28:33.441 --> 02:28:35.382]  Like he can't learn to be a biker somewhere else.
[02:28:35.382 --> 02:28:36.822]  As if being a biker is criminal.
[02:28:37.762 --> 02:28:48.986]  Well, some of these bikers are, of course, but they're running all these demonizing pieces about basically free speech on the Internet, readying us all for the Internet, too.
[02:28:48.986 --> 02:28:55.888]  Yeah, they've announced Internet 2, cybersecurity command in the President's own words, so they can shut the web down for all our safety.
[02:28:55.888 --> 02:28:59.089]  Jay Rockefeller says we'd be better off without it.
[02:28:59.089 --> 02:29:01.090]  And I keep warning people, it's here!
[02:29:01.090 --> 02:29:06.452]  You know, I want to beat these people, and I want to fight.
[02:29:07.691 --> 02:29:11.433]  But in a sick way, if they lock me up or shut me down, I want it to do this every day.
[02:29:11.433 --> 02:29:15.635]  Because, I mean, look, I know we're reaching a lot of people.
[02:29:15.635 --> 02:29:19.117]  I know it's really positive.
[02:29:19.117 --> 02:29:23.039]  It's just, I'm so sick of looking at the New World Order people.
[02:29:23.039 --> 02:29:25.720]  I'm so sick of their enjoyment of evil.
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:28.161]  I'm so sick of... Hey, great call.
[02:29:28.161 --> 02:29:29.122]  Anything else, Kevin?
[02:29:30.306 --> 02:29:39.488]  Yeah, I was surfing some Joe Rogan comedy after watching him on Burmese's show, and I noticed that on this other show that he was on, they had video call-ins.
[02:29:39.488 --> 02:29:43.789]  I don't believe Joe Rogan was on Jason Burmese's show, but you can finish up on the other side.
[02:29:43.789 --> 02:29:44.830]  Stay with us.
[02:29:44.830 --> 02:29:51.511]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.511 --> 02:29:52.892]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.892 --> 02:29:55.432]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.432 --> 02:29:58.113]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.828 --> 02:30:05.072]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.072 --> 02:30:07.074]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.074 --> 02:30:15.603]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.603 --> 02:30:21.148]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.148 --> 02:30:22.790]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:23.010 --> 02:30:29.511]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.511 --> 02:30:40.574]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.574 --> 02:30:41.334]  That's right.
[02:30:41.334 --> 02:30:43.914]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:30:43.914 --> 02:30:45.495]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:30:48.056 --> 02:31:06.068]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.068 --> 02:31:08.149]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:31:08.149 --> 02:31:10.591]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.591 --> 02:31:12.872]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.872 --> 02:31:14.493]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.493 --> 02:31:15.514]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.754 --> 02:31:24.179]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:33:19.281 --> 02:33:24.523]  The people are waking up.
[02:33:24.523 --> 02:33:31.465]  So the establishment is giving them fake alternatives.
[02:33:31.465 --> 02:33:32.666]  Judas Goats.
[02:33:32.666 --> 02:33:35.867]  Controlled opposition.
[02:33:35.867 --> 02:33:45.030]  But if you stand on ideas and stand on the Bill of Rights and Constitution, it doesn't matter what those Judas Goats try, the people will be victorious.
[02:33:47.165 --> 02:33:50.187]  And I'm telling you, Glenn Beck's already stabbed us in the back dozens of times.
[02:33:50.187 --> 02:33:51.007]  He's going to do it again.
[02:33:51.007 --> 02:33:53.349]  And they're building him up as the leader.
[02:33:53.349 --> 02:33:55.730]  And that's very dangerous.
[02:33:55.730 --> 02:33:57.911]  That's why I reached out to him in the last hour.
[02:33:57.911 --> 02:34:06.356]  Paul Watson is doing a detailed report either tonight or tomorrow on that subject, my public letter to Glenn Beck, encapsulating the points I made.
[02:34:09.288 --> 02:34:10.969]  Talked to the caller, he got it confused.
[02:34:10.969 --> 02:34:14.051]  Joe Rogan has been on my show, not on Burma's, as we call Burma's in here to check.
[02:34:14.051 --> 02:34:18.774]  But you were going to bring up something else, caller, about video call-ins from listeners.
[02:34:18.774 --> 02:34:33.142]  Yes, I do want my producers to start talking to more of our guests we have on, not just Rivero and a few filmmakers we've had on, to have more people on as guests via video link for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:34:35.597 --> 02:34:45.126]  And yes, I did think about a phone line where people can call and leave 30 second messages.
[02:34:45.126 --> 02:34:47.468]  In fact, I want to implement this now.
[02:34:47.468 --> 02:34:49.790]  Let's make it one minute messages.
[02:34:49.790 --> 02:34:56.316]  A line people call where we can listen to the messages every day, the producers can, but leave them to one minute.
[02:34:58.243 --> 02:35:05.485]  And the best rants or the best points, the guys can grab 10 or 15 of those a day and have it part of the show.
[02:35:05.485 --> 02:35:06.785]  Can we implement that today?
[02:35:06.785 --> 02:35:09.305]  All right, good.
[02:35:09.305 --> 02:35:12.766]  We will launch that.
[02:35:12.766 --> 02:35:15.747]  Can we set a box up today?
[02:35:15.747 --> 02:35:15.927]  Good.
[02:35:15.927 --> 02:35:17.827]  At the end of the show, I'll give you the number.
[02:35:17.827 --> 02:35:22.308]  And then every day, no matter how many guests we've got on, we'll air at least five calls.
[02:35:27.816 --> 02:35:31.797]  So that's something exciting we're gonna add.
[02:35:31.797 --> 02:35:36.538]  And you can disagree on the phone line, you can agree, you can bring up points.
[02:35:36.538 --> 02:35:40.159]  The most interesting stuff, we'll edit it together, say five minutes every day.
[02:35:40.159 --> 02:35:41.159]  How's that sound guys?
[02:35:41.159 --> 02:35:43.279]  The five best calls.
[02:35:43.279 --> 02:35:49.081]  And then maybe we can do something like take the other better ones and have an area where we just post them on InfoWars.com.
[02:35:49.081 --> 02:35:50.961]  Pretty exciting, huh?
[02:35:50.961 --> 02:35:53.842]  Do something like that, you know, the daily best calls of the day.
[02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:58.832]  Okay, and yes, the caller, are you still there, Kevin?
[02:35:58.832 --> 02:35:59.912]  Yes, I am.
[02:35:59.912 --> 02:36:12.038]  You were talking about having PrisonPlanet.tv members be able to open it up to a few video calls every day so people can call in on video via Skype and be on TV with us.
[02:36:12.038 --> 02:36:13.619]  Yeah.
[02:36:13.619 --> 02:36:15.880]  I think that would be great.
[02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:16.580]  I think it's a great idea.
[02:36:16.580 --> 02:36:17.741]  Go ahead and tell us about it.
[02:36:19.512 --> 02:36:21.173]  Um, well there's some other people that are doing it.
[02:36:21.173 --> 02:36:22.494]  I just think it'd be really interesting.
[02:36:22.494 --> 02:36:25.876]  It would, uh, increase the amount of subscriptions that you get at Prison Planet.
[02:36:25.876 --> 02:36:29.137]  I think everybody should get their Prison Planet, uh, membership if they don't have one.
[02:36:29.137 --> 02:36:31.198]  It'd be a lot of fun for us.
[02:36:31.198 --> 02:36:33.420]  And, uh, I just think you guys should keep up the great work.
[02:36:33.420 --> 02:36:34.660]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:37.562]  You can't change the laws of physics, and 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:36:38.001 --> 02:36:38.801]  All right, God bless you.
[02:36:38.801 --> 02:36:40.182]  I appreciate the call.
[02:36:40.182 --> 02:36:47.906]  And two hours and 37 minutes into this broadcast, I will take some time out to ask listeners for support today.

[02:38:00.636 --> 02:38:02.318]  There's also PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:38:02.318 --> 02:38:03.079]  15 cents a day.

[02:38:30.226 --> 02:38:34.811]  My book, Paul Watson's book, a lot of other great films we posted there, been authorized to post there.
[02:38:36.277 --> 02:38:38.759]  My live TV show every day.
[02:38:38.759 --> 02:38:39.800]  Posted as an archive.
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:41.180]  Watch when you want, how you want.
[02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:43.182]  The live stream of the show.
[02:38:43.182 --> 02:38:45.363]  The audio archives of the radio show.
[02:38:45.363 --> 02:38:47.965]  Not in 32-bit, but in 64-bit.
[02:38:47.965 --> 02:38:49.566]  Correct, it's 64-bit.
[02:38:49.566 --> 02:38:51.708]  For President Blinden, I always get the bit rates wrong.
[02:38:51.708 --> 02:38:53.369]  People are like, you said 62!
[02:38:53.369 --> 02:38:54.790]  It's 64, liar!
[02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:56.812]  Okay, whatever, 60-something.
[02:38:56.812 --> 02:38:57.052]  64?
[02:38:57.052 --> 02:38:58.753]  64, okay.
[02:38:58.753 --> 02:38:59.533]  It's a conspiracy!
[02:38:59.533 --> 02:39:01.455]  64 is an encoded message of 62!
[02:39:01.455 --> 02:39:03.436]  Anyways, the point is,
[02:39:06.889 --> 02:39:14.511]  is that prisonplanet.tv is there and we we're expanding what we're doing.
[02:39:14.511 --> 02:39:20.573]  I've been waiting three months for the city to give us permits to build our new studio.
[02:39:20.573 --> 02:39:25.414]  Maybe I should give the permit office's number out.
[02:39:25.414 --> 02:39:27.315]  I mean, I tell you, the government just makes me sick.
[02:39:27.315 --> 02:39:30.716]  You can't get contractors coming here without a permit, holding me up on what I'm doing.
[02:39:30.716 --> 02:39:35.217]  The point is, side issue, it comes out in
[02:39:36.246 --> 02:39:37.909]  Three days.
[02:39:37.909 --> 02:39:39.412]  Three and a half days.
[02:39:39.412 --> 02:39:47.608]  Camp FEMA that I consulted on, that I'm one of the main contributors on, is a out-of-the-park documentary film.
[02:39:48.792 --> 02:39:51.133]  And it is available right now at InfoWars.com.

[02:40:04.139 --> 02:40:06.200]  You can also write to me at InfoWars at P.O.
[02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:07.000]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.

[02:40:07.781 --> 02:40:07.941]  Box 19549.
[02:40:17.745 --> 02:40:22.846]  Austin, Texas, 78760.
[02:40:22.846 --> 02:40:30.887]  Okay.
[02:40:30.887 --> 02:40:34.288]  I want to go back to your calls and get into the financial news.
[02:40:34.288 --> 02:40:35.868]  I want to do that.
[02:40:35.868 --> 02:40:42.069]  But while I'm at it plugging things that make the show possible, I'm going to tell you about Diginet.net.
[02:40:42.069 --> 02:40:46.890]  They have these great little, very inexpensive, hidden memory stick
[02:40:48.899 --> 02:40:49.239]  I don't
[02:41:06.488 --> 02:41:06.928]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:24.563 --> 02:41:27.725]  Or people starting stuff with you in parking lots, whatever.
[02:41:27.725 --> 02:41:30.306]  It's great to carry these on you.
[02:41:30.306 --> 02:41:31.907]  Diginet.net.
[02:41:31.907 --> 02:41:34.868]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:41:34.868 --> 02:41:39.771]  Diginet.net.
[02:41:39.771 --> 02:41:41.852]  Definitely check them out today.
[02:41:41.852 --> 02:41:43.052]  In fact, put that back up on screen.
[02:41:43.052 --> 02:41:44.773]  I want to give folks their number as well.
[02:41:44.773 --> 02:41:45.013]  Or 888-344-6681.
[02:41:45.013 --> 02:41:45.053]  888-344-6681.
[02:41:50.896 --> 02:41:51.456]  We're good to go.
[02:42:12.898 --> 02:42:27.843]  Well, that's where I choose to get my storable foods, that's where I think you should get them, efoodsdirect.com, that's efoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or as I said, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:42:27.843 --> 02:42:39.088]  Okay, let's now go back one minute apiece, because I've got to get into the financial news here, and talk to Dave in Florida.
[02:42:39.088 --> 02:42:39.788]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:42:41.167 --> 02:42:41.827]  Hey, Alex.
[02:42:41.827 --> 02:42:43.327]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:42:43.327 --> 02:42:45.888]  I've been watching the Weather Channel over the past few days.
[02:42:45.888 --> 02:42:48.189]  Just a quick point here.
[02:42:48.189 --> 02:42:56.350]  The Weather Channel is now having a report on where they admit that sunspots are causing short-term global warming.
[02:42:56.350 --> 02:42:57.971]  But they're saying it's only temporary.
[02:42:57.971 --> 02:43:00.111]  It's a respite from man-made global warming.
[02:43:00.111 --> 02:43:04.212]  As soon as the sunspots come back, the global warming is going to come right back on.
[02:43:04.212 --> 02:43:07.953]  And then they come on with their ten-point list of how we can change our lives for the better.
[02:43:08.473 --> 02:43:14.701]  And the founder of the Weather Channel came out, who's a meteorologist, and said it's all a huge stinking fraud.
[02:43:14.701 --> 02:43:15.803]  They laugh.
[02:43:15.803 --> 02:43:17.505]  They know it's about taxing.
[02:43:17.505 --> 02:43:19.828]  Carbon dioxide is not dirty carbon.
[02:43:19.828 --> 02:43:20.649]  It's not carbon.
[02:43:20.649 --> 02:43:21.890]  Carbon's a solid.
[02:43:21.890 --> 02:43:23.252]  Carbon dioxide's a gas.
[02:43:24.113 --> 02:43:27.094]  Or when it's condensed to liquid, and they know that.
[02:43:27.094 --> 02:43:31.274]  And local car washes in Austin say, don't wash your car at home, it's illegal.
[02:43:31.274 --> 02:43:33.055]  It hurts the carbon footprint.
[02:43:33.055 --> 02:43:35.675]  Come to our car wash, we use less.
[02:43:35.675 --> 02:43:38.996]  I mean, it's just all total Soviet takeover.
[02:43:38.996 --> 02:43:40.456]  Go ahead.
[02:43:40.456 --> 02:43:45.857]  Yeah, they want you to go around your house and unplug all your devices now and plug your TV when you're not watching.
[02:43:45.857 --> 02:43:47.737]  And they're going to make that a crime.
[02:43:47.737 --> 02:43:50.638]  They're going to make that a crime and you're going to have monthly home inspections.
[02:43:52.219 --> 02:43:55.080]  Yeah, another point here I just wanted to bring up here.
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:58.321]  This is something, just a question for you actually.
[02:43:58.321 --> 02:44:12.446]  In regards to the fluoride in the water and everywhere else, have you seen any evidence to the fact that if you stop taking in the fluoride that the damage itself will reverse itself or are you pretty much stuck with whatever you've already taken into your body over the years?
[02:44:12.506 --> 02:44:25.437]  Okay, I'm not a medical doctor or a toxicologist, but I've interviewed the head toxicologist for the EPA, who got over 90% of their scientists to sign a letter saying, take this out of the water.
[02:44:25.437 --> 02:44:29.241]  We had him on last year, but we should have him back on.
[02:44:29.241 --> 02:44:31.683]  He's the head toxicologist and the head of the EPA union.
[02:44:34.062 --> 02:44:38.545]  Because he said, yeah, 20 years ago in school I was for calcium fluoride in the water a little bit.
[02:44:38.545 --> 02:44:40.386]  That's good for your teeth and bones.
[02:44:40.386 --> 02:44:44.088]  I didn't know that it wasn't just sodium fluoride that's deadly poison.
[02:44:44.088 --> 02:44:50.992]  It's a catch-all term for, depending on the system, 130 to over 300 chemicals.
[02:44:50.992 --> 02:44:54.014]  Austin, it's hundreds and hundreds.
[02:44:56.855 --> 02:45:06.658]  They take the toxic waste from nuclear weapons production, from fertilizer production, and from aluminum production, and they dump it right in your water.
[02:45:06.658 --> 02:45:12.500]  And fluoride poisoning is cumulative.
[02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:17.222]  And it precipitates in the bones and glands.
[02:45:17.222 --> 02:45:19.643]  It's proven to cause hundreds of cancers.
[02:45:19.643 --> 02:45:22.324]  Just right now in front of everybody, startpage.com.
[02:45:22.324 --> 02:45:23.404]  Search it out, folks.
[02:45:23.404 --> 02:45:25.305]  Or Google or whatever.
[02:45:25.305 --> 02:45:26.105]  You can go to it.
[02:45:28.539 --> 02:45:31.140]  And type in fluoride cancer.
[02:45:31.140 --> 02:45:32.661]  And it's just absolutely admitted.
[02:45:32.661 --> 02:45:34.582]  But that's just sodium fluoride!
[02:45:34.582 --> 02:45:37.684]  Not the catch-all term, even worse.
[02:45:37.684 --> 02:45:48.169]  They know that if you get off of it, it reverses some of the damage, because the cumulative gets worse and worse, and some of it reverses, but not all of it.
[02:45:48.169 --> 02:45:53.271]  And it depends on the host organism, and your age, and how long you were on it.
[02:45:53.271 --> 02:45:56.573]  They know that fluoride has double the effects
[02:45:57.473 --> 02:46:00.334]  On the young, developing brains.
[02:46:00.334 --> 02:46:11.319]  That's why it says fluoride just for babies at all the grocery stores, and the mothers buy it greedily with pleasure, and wonder why their kid's completely brain-dead, drooling in the corner, watching TV.
[02:46:11.319 --> 02:46:16.981]  Because they love their children, and 80 plus percent of advertising targets women, because they're trusting.
[02:46:16.981 --> 02:46:18.342]  They're not stupid, they're just trusting.
[02:46:19.255 --> 02:46:20.657]  Of anything that's in their environment.
[02:46:20.657 --> 02:46:21.638]  They're not trusting of men.
[02:46:21.638 --> 02:46:23.019]  They've been taught to not trust men.
[02:46:23.019 --> 02:46:25.602]  But they trust the New World Order technocrat men.
[02:46:25.602 --> 02:46:27.804]  And if it's for their baby, they do it.
[02:46:27.804 --> 02:46:38.255]  Even though the American Medical Association, American Dental Association for three years have said, don't give babies fluoride water, don't give them toothpaste, it causes cancer and bone fractures and dental fluorosis.
[02:46:39.127 --> 02:46:54.000]  The mothers don't care, and they put levels, conservatively from the reports I've read, a hundred times stronger in the fluoride water for kids than what is in the water one part per million.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:00.326]  They put mega brain damaging, and those mothers give them Pedialyte with Aspartame with pleasure.
[02:47:00.326 --> 02:47:05.050]  They, you know, the convulsions, the brain damage, it's a religion to do it.
[02:47:05.050 --> 02:47:05.851]  It's a sick
[02:47:06.818 --> 02:47:10.859]  Munchausen by proxy that the whole government does to children with pleasure.
[02:47:10.859 --> 02:47:12.939]  Does that answer your question?
[02:47:12.939 --> 02:47:16.520]  Yeah, thanks very much, Alex.
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:18.320]  And they love it.
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:19.181]  Oh, there's Reuters.
[02:47:19.181 --> 02:47:21.221]  Another study links fluoride to bone cancer.
[02:47:21.221 --> 02:47:22.621]  Oh, would you like more?
[02:47:22.621 --> 02:47:23.602]  Would you like to see more?
[02:47:23.602 --> 02:47:28.403]  We could just go for hours with these studies.
[02:47:28.403 --> 02:47:30.143]  Oh, I'm not playing games.
[02:47:30.143 --> 02:47:30.343]  I mean,
[02:47:31.431 --> 02:47:41.593]  We have just been incrementally eased into the warm water, and then they turn the scalding water on, and we're just boiling, and they're going, there, there, there.
[02:47:41.593 --> 02:47:42.993]  You drink your water.
[02:47:42.993 --> 02:47:48.435]  Yes, your testicles are shriveling up.
[02:47:48.435 --> 02:47:50.815]  Oh, suddenly the male sperm counts down by 87%.
[02:47:50.815 --> 02:47:51.935]  Oh, London Guardian.
[02:47:55.865 --> 02:48:01.790]  Fluoride water causes cancer, especially in boys' testicles and bones.
[02:48:01.790 --> 02:48:05.694]  Oh, we wonder why the boys are like girls now.
[02:48:05.694 --> 02:48:12.660]  The chemical weapon hit their fast-growing cells, and nothing grows faster than sperm.
[02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:15.162]  But you produce millions of a month.
[02:48:15.162 --> 02:48:18.505]  But now they don't have tails, and now they can't swim.
[02:48:19.707 --> 02:48:23.190]  The chemical weapon did good!
[02:48:23.190 --> 02:48:27.454]  The military and police and the boys that planted the bombs in the towers?
[02:48:27.454 --> 02:48:31.598]  Did the government tell you not to feed your kids fluoride?
[02:48:31.598 --> 02:48:34.661]  Did the government tell you not to take the mercury shots?
[02:48:34.661 --> 02:48:36.543]  Oh, you didn't get a warning!
[02:48:36.543 --> 02:48:38.905]  You're being soft killed!
[02:48:38.905 --> 02:48:41.888]  But at least you had the power to blow up those towers.
[02:48:41.888 --> 02:48:44.631]  You little pyromaniac bomb bugs.
[02:48:45.322 --> 02:48:46.102]  And so you don't care.
[02:48:46.102 --> 02:48:47.502]  It's kind of fun.
[02:48:47.502 --> 02:48:48.643]  Your masters are killing you.
[02:48:48.643 --> 02:48:50.363]  It's kind of fun.
[02:48:50.363 --> 02:48:51.583]  Yeah, you like it.
[02:48:51.583 --> 02:48:54.544]  At least it's nasty and feels good, huh?
[02:48:54.544 --> 02:48:56.204]  Feels good?
[02:48:56.204 --> 02:48:57.444]  Feels good, doesn't it?
[02:48:57.444 --> 02:49:00.045]  Feels good to have that five-year-old that's retarded?
[02:49:00.045 --> 02:49:03.085]  Even though they don't have any chromosome problems?
[02:49:03.085 --> 02:49:06.246]  Feels good everybody around you is semi-retarded now?
[02:49:06.246 --> 02:49:08.426]  Feels good, doesn't it?
[02:49:08.426 --> 02:49:09.806]  Yeah, feels good.
[02:49:09.806 --> 02:49:10.847]  Death feels good for you.
[02:49:10.847 --> 02:49:11.467]  Don't worry.
[02:49:11.467 --> 02:49:13.147]  Death will come soon enough for all of us.
[02:49:16.755 --> 02:49:22.102]  I mean, I can't even hardly do this show anymore.
[02:49:22.102 --> 02:49:23.444]  It's not that I don't want to fight.
[02:49:23.444 --> 02:49:26.007]  It's not that it's not a great honor to fight.
[02:49:26.007 --> 02:49:30.713]  It's that it's so ridiculously obvious.
[02:49:30.713 --> 02:49:33.958]  I mean, this whole world government is just out in the open
[02:49:38.311 --> 02:49:40.612]  And I know I don't even do the best job exposing it.
[02:49:40.612 --> 02:49:59.602]  Where are all you clean-cut yuppies I see riding up 360, up hills, perfect shape, getting out of the hike and bike trail out of your brand-new BMWs, your cars are totally clean, you're totally well-spoken, you've got your crap together, you know, your wife looks absolutely perfect, your kids are all well-behaved.
[02:49:59.602 --> 02:50:01.803]  I mean, why don't you care enough to find out about all this?
[02:50:01.803 --> 02:50:06.005]  Because you socially, it's not kosher to talk about this.
[02:50:10.157 --> 02:50:11.578]  And so you go along with it.
[02:50:11.578 --> 02:50:13.979]  But you drink filtered water.
[02:50:13.979 --> 02:50:16.220]  You eat non-GMO.
[02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:21.063]  And I talk to these yuppies and they kind of go, yeah, but the underclass is always eating poison.
[02:50:21.063 --> 02:50:24.825]  And they're just kind of, ah, like they're part of the system.
[02:50:24.825 --> 02:50:27.067]  Where is your humanity?
[02:50:27.067 --> 02:50:29.248]  Where is your humanity?
[02:50:29.248 --> 02:50:33.630]  You can't just write off humanity and then not write yourself off.
[02:50:33.630 --> 02:50:38.633]  I want you to understand that when you become a servant, and none of us are perfect.
[02:50:38.633 --> 02:50:39.734]  I'm out on some high horse here.
[02:50:40.725 --> 02:50:53.870]  That when you supplicate your will into the greater stream of human species development, that you unlock things in your mind and soul and become truly human.
[02:50:53.870 --> 02:51:00.092]  I'm just sad for you that you're not taking part in humanity's struggle to be free.
[02:51:00.092 --> 02:51:01.533]  We are at that crossroads.
[02:51:02.779 --> 02:51:13.342]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:51:13.342 --> 02:51:14.762]  Garden in a Can.

[02:51:33.371 --> 02:51:34.792]  Garden in a Can.

[02:52:08.409 --> 02:52:10.731]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:52:10.731 --> 02:52:19.075]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:52:19.075 --> 02:52:26.520]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:33.344]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:52:33.897 --> 02:52:38.259]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:38.259 --> 02:52:42.220]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:42.220 --> 02:52:44.481]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:44.481 --> 02:52:48.923]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:53:47.011 --> 02:53:49.792]  We are being forcibly medicated through the food supply and water supply.
[02:54:17.816 --> 02:54:18.957]  It's now been declassified.
[02:54:18.957 --> 02:54:24.942]  They are chemtrailing us and terraforming the planet, geoengineering it.
[02:54:24.942 --> 02:54:28.105]  God only knows what else we're not aware of.
[02:54:28.105 --> 02:54:37.033]  The top genetic engineers we've had on have confirmed that they are adding sterolins through the genetic makeup of the cross-species food crops we're eating.
[02:54:41.792 --> 02:54:44.493]  And we can't even come together as a people against the New World Order.
[02:54:44.493 --> 02:54:54.919]  We're just going to let these people do this to us and write textbooks about how they're doing it.
[02:54:54.919 --> 02:54:57.020]  They're assaulting your children.
[02:54:57.020 --> 02:55:00.022]  They're assaulting you.
[02:55:00.022 --> 02:55:02.984]  People thank me for fighting and thank me for being involved.
[02:55:02.984 --> 02:55:04.804]  Why are you thanking me?
[02:55:04.804 --> 02:55:10.908]  It's completely normal to stand up and do whatever you can
[02:55:13.086 --> 02:55:16.069]  To fight against the tyranny.
[02:55:16.069 --> 02:55:21.636]  And I've never seen a tyranny this wicked, this systematic.
[02:55:21.636 --> 02:55:27.722]  Let's go back to calls, and then coming up at 8 after, I'm going directly into the financial analysis, and this is important.
[02:55:27.722 --> 02:55:31.467]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sandy in Utah.
[02:55:31.467 --> 02:55:32.348]  Sandy, you're on the air.
[02:55:33.533 --> 02:55:35.874]  Hi Alex, it's good to talk to you.
[02:55:35.874 --> 02:55:38.596]  It's good to talk to you.
[02:55:38.596 --> 02:55:41.638]  I want you to know I really appreciate you and Charlie.
[02:55:41.638 --> 02:55:43.059]  I appreciate you.
[02:55:43.059 --> 02:55:48.962]  And I have gotten a lot of your movies and things and I've given them out to people to watch.
[02:55:48.962 --> 02:55:53.245]  And I also just wanted to talk about a couple of things.
[02:55:53.245 --> 02:55:58.588]  First off, my son went into the Marines in the early 90s.
[02:56:01.844 --> 02:56:20.129]  And he took that arm survey and he put on there he didn't agree with anything about the UN and on that last question he indicated, he said to them, hell no, I will join with the US citizens.
[02:56:20.129 --> 02:56:21.529]  I will not take their guns away.
[02:56:21.971 --> 02:56:23.893]  Shortly after that he received a bunch of vaccinations.
[02:56:23.893 --> 02:56:26.215]  Shortly after that he became ill.
[02:56:26.215 --> 02:56:28.397]  So they gave him a medical discharge.
[02:56:28.397 --> 02:56:31.880]  And I believe, of course, that they were trying to weed out all those that were sick.
[02:56:46.565 --> 02:56:46.945]  No, no, no.
[02:56:46.945 --> 02:56:47.765]  We've confirmed.
[02:56:47.765 --> 02:56:58.849]  They give soft kill, this is confirmed, soft kill shots to people, to the 75%, and it usually is meant to kick in about five years after you're out.
[02:56:58.849 --> 02:57:02.811]  Because as Homeland Security says, the number one threat to their New World Order.
[02:57:02.811 --> 02:57:05.492]  Homeland Security's here for the corporate criminal takeover.
[02:57:05.492 --> 02:57:09.233]  They're the criminal enforcer to take care of the gang raping of America.
[02:57:10.270 --> 02:57:13.892]  Their number one threat is returning vets and gun owners.
[02:57:13.892 --> 02:57:16.333]  And that's what they're training the Boy Scouts for.
[02:57:16.333 --> 02:57:18.214]  To take on the veterans.
[02:57:18.214 --> 02:57:20.495]  The new Hitler youth.
[02:57:20.495 --> 02:57:24.397]  And, uh... God, I'm sorry they did that to your son.
[02:57:24.397 --> 02:57:26.919]  You know, there's some detoxes he can do.
[02:57:26.919 --> 02:57:27.939]  Some other things he can do.
[02:57:27.939 --> 02:57:34.983]  Yeah, he's been using a lot of different herbs and things, but he's battled this thing ever since then.
[02:57:34.983 --> 02:57:36.864]  What's he have, like arthritis and things?
[02:57:37.915 --> 02:57:39.997]  Well, it's colitis is what it is.
[02:57:39.997 --> 02:57:45.761]  Yeah, a lot of times it attacks Crohn's-like type diseases, totally confirmed.
[02:57:45.761 --> 02:57:49.463]  It attacks the entire intestine.
[02:57:49.463 --> 02:57:50.304]  Yeah, it does.
[02:57:50.304 --> 02:57:59.431]  But he's been really, he's a brilliant kid and he's, he's studied the militaries of all the countries and he knows, he knows a lot.
[02:57:59.431 --> 02:58:02.853]  Anyway, he's a year younger than you, Alex.
[02:58:02.853 --> 02:58:06.416]  And the other thing is, well,
[02:58:07.645 --> 02:58:17.807]  Back then, too, just before we went into the Marines, they told our kids in the 8th and 11th grade that they had to have vaccines.
[02:58:17.807 --> 02:58:23.288]  And so we called the superintendent up and we said, okay, what are the vaccines for?
[02:58:23.288 --> 02:58:24.669]  What's in them?
[02:58:24.669 --> 02:58:26.709]  And why do they have to have them?
[02:58:26.709 --> 02:58:32.310]  And his reply was, well, the government told me to do it.
[02:58:32.310 --> 02:58:34.851]  And we said, well, don't you think you better be finding out?
[02:58:37.318 --> 02:58:42.966]  Tell me more about how that ended when we come back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:42.966 --> 02:58:46.231]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.231 --> 02:58:48.474]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.479 --> 02:58:56.683]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:58:56.683 --> 02:59:00.707]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.707 --> 02:59:06.612]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:06.612 --> 02:59:11.676]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.676 --> 02:59:12.177]  Number three,
[02:59:12.577 --> 02:59:18.884]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:59:18.884 --> 02:59:21.788]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:59:21.788 --> 02:59:26.313]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.313 --> 02:59:29.917]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:59:30.157 --> 02:59:35.879]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:59:35.879 --> 02:59:40.581]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:40.581 --> 02:59:42.341]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.341 --> 02:59:44.922]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[02:59:44.922 --> 02:59:54.005]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[02:59:54.005 --> 02:59:56.386]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.386 --> 02:59:59.167]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:05.489 --> 03:00:15.652]  Alright, we're going to take a few more calls right now.
[03:00:15.652 --> 03:00:26.135]  Then at the 8 after, I'm going to spend a couple of segments breaking down the financial reform legislation that Obama is pushing and how that fits into this whole world government system.
[03:00:26.135 --> 03:00:32.856]  And all the headlines we've been seeing about UN wants new world reserve currency to replace the dollar.
[03:00:32.856 --> 03:00:34.097]  Remember that headline?
[03:00:34.097 --> 03:00:34.657]  Last week.
[03:00:35.794 --> 03:00:39.877]  The 8th and 11th graders had to get these shots because the government said so.
[03:00:39.877 --> 03:00:42.179]  Well, we said, well, our kids aren't getting them.
[03:00:42.179 --> 03:00:45.802]  So we went and got some waivers for them.
[03:01:05.327 --> 03:01:07.228]  And we made copies.
[03:01:07.228 --> 03:01:10.689]  And so they didn't get them, you know, at the time.
[03:01:10.689 --> 03:01:15.571]  But I know, I've never cared for vaccines for a long time.
[03:01:15.571 --> 03:01:24.235]  And I, at the age of eleven and a half when Jeff K was killed, I knew I wasn't getting the truth.
[03:01:24.235 --> 03:01:27.096]  And I was determined to find out what it was.
[03:01:27.096 --> 03:01:29.017]  And I did.
[03:01:29.017 --> 03:01:33.519]  The other thing is, I was watching Glenn Beck the other day.
[03:01:33.519 --> 03:01:34.239]  On Saturday.
[03:01:35.444 --> 03:01:38.645]  And they were switching back and forth.
[03:01:38.645 --> 03:01:47.047]  And they switched to him at one point, and it looked to me like he was in a trance.
[03:01:47.047 --> 03:01:47.767]  And it hit me.
[03:01:47.767 --> 03:01:51.749]  I thought, he has been hypnotized.
[03:01:51.749 --> 03:01:55.650]  And he's probably on psychotropic drugs.
[03:01:55.650 --> 03:02:01.331]  And I think that he joined the Mormon Church to bring them down.
[03:02:01.331 --> 03:02:03.892]  And he's... I got a message for him.
[03:02:05.347 --> 03:02:15.294]  If he thinks he's going to bring down the Patriots in America and the Mormon Church, he's got another thing coming, because he will have to face the Lord.
[03:02:15.294 --> 03:02:17.996]  Alright, Sandy, I appreciate your call.
[03:02:17.996 --> 03:02:32.526]  Yeah, no, he does act... I mean, everybody screws around and has some fun when you do a long show every day, but he constantly just acts crazy and goofy and fruity, and he's not like a George Washington.
[03:02:32.526 --> 03:02:33.767]  I mean, he just is really
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:38.923]  Creepy!
[03:02:38.923 --> 03:02:41.005]  And he's bad news.
[03:02:41.005 --> 03:02:42.626]  Look, I care about my children's future.
[03:02:42.626 --> 03:02:47.371]  I'm not here bashing him because, you know, he's a bigger talk show host than me and I don't like it.
[03:02:47.371 --> 03:02:59.162]  Because so many people do that to me that I almost don't like to talk bad about Beck or anybody else because it like lowers you to do that.
[03:02:59.162 --> 03:03:00.604]  But you've got to talk about
[03:03:01.747 --> 03:03:05.629]  Thanks.
[03:03:05.629 --> 03:03:18.735]  I was just calling because I completely agree with your assessment about Glenn Beck.
[03:03:18.735 --> 03:03:26.819]  It's like, because he comes off like how Stephen Colbert does it, his character, but he's like serious about it.
[03:03:26.819 --> 03:03:28.060]  And he's crying and stuff.
[03:03:28.516 --> 03:03:34.558]  And he's bringing, like, real facts, but he's, you know, you know, like, his past, so it's like... Well, it's meant to discredit it.
[03:03:34.558 --> 03:03:38.619]  I mean, look at how he supported the banker bailout bill.
[03:03:38.619 --> 03:03:41.040]  And then says he's fighting the New World Order.
[03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:43.640]  And then he said, arrest Ron Paul supporters.
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:45.721]  When Ron Paul had a chance to win.
[03:03:45.721 --> 03:03:55.464]  So, see, he shows who he is, right when we're getting headway, he'll go, there's no FEMA camps, there's no government corruption, we need to support the Patriot Act,
[03:03:56.195 --> 03:03:57.935]  We need to arrest Ron Paul supporters.
[03:03:57.935 --> 03:04:00.956]  Ron Paul's dangerous.
[03:04:00.956 --> 03:04:03.197]  Oh, we need this banker bailout, Bill.
[03:04:03.197 --> 03:04:07.878]  I mean, with friends like this, who needs enemies?
[03:04:07.878 --> 03:04:18.941]  Yeah, and also, it's the same thing with Barack Obama, except where he's playing a role, like when he talks, to me, he reminds me of a preacher, like a black preacher or something like that.
[03:04:18.941 --> 03:04:21.662]  When he talks, when he gives his speech, it's more like he's preaching.
[03:04:21.662 --> 03:04:22.622]  That's how I get the feeling.
[03:04:23.300 --> 03:04:24.441]  It's like, it's kind of weird.
[03:04:24.441 --> 03:04:25.381]  No, that's about it.
[03:04:25.381 --> 03:04:26.081]  Thank you, though.
[03:04:41.929 --> 03:04:42.469]  God bless you.
[03:04:42.469 --> 03:04:43.670]  Good to hear from you, Chris.
[03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:50.195]  All right, Chris in Maryland, Josh in California, Ryan in Indiana, and others.
[03:04:50.195 --> 03:04:52.757]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[03:04:52.757 --> 03:04:59.822]  And we're going to come back and break down what's really happening with the economy straight ahead on the one and the only GCN Radio Network.
[03:05:01.650 --> 03:05:04.652]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.652 --> 03:05:09.997]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.997 --> 03:05:12.039]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.039 --> 03:05:17.043]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.043 --> 03:05:18.224]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.224 --> 03:05:19.345]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.345 --> 03:05:21.246]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.246 --> 03:05:21.987]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.287 --> 03:05:24.488]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.488 --> 03:05:25.829]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.829 --> 03:05:27.370]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.370 --> 03:05:32.633]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.633 --> 03:05:36.215]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.215 --> 03:05:39.677]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.037 --> 03:05:41.258]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.258 --> 03:05:42.158]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.158 --> 03:05:43.259]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.259 --> 03:05:44.199]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.199 --> 03:05:45.300]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.300 --> 03:05:48.342]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.342 --> 03:05:50.123]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.123 --> 03:05:51.043]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:01.479 --> 03:06:08.241]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:06:08.241 --> 03:06:10.882]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:06:10.882 --> 03:06:12.422]  But who is the enemy?
[03:06:12.422 --> 03:06:13.223]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:13.223 --> 03:06:14.163]  This is his ammo.
[03:06:14.163 --> 03:06:15.603]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:15.603 --> 03:06:17.584]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:17.584 --> 03:06:24.726]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:06:24.726 --> 03:06:25.206]  Some U.S.
[03:06:25.206 --> 03:06:30.848]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:31.568 --> 03:06:35.071]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:35.071 --> 03:06:45.540]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:06:45.540 --> 03:06:46.781]  Fabled enemies.
[03:06:46.781 --> 03:06:54.507]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:54.507 --> 03:06:57.890]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:07:01.499 --> 03:07:08.646]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[03:07:08.646 --> 03:07:24.561]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[03:07:24.841 --> 03:07:30.205]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[03:07:30.205 --> 03:07:36.730]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[03:07:36.730 --> 03:07:40.633]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[03:07:40.633 --> 03:07:43.315]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[03:07:43.315 --> 03:07:48.679]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[03:07:48.979 --> 03:07:51.660]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:07:51.660 --> 03:07:53.881]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[03:07:53.881 --> 03:07:56.382]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[03:07:56.382 --> 03:08:03.004]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[03:08:03.004 --> 03:08:09.626]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.626 --> 03:08:12.607]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.232 --> 03:08:34.219]  Alright, I'm going to break down the big fight we're facing that frankly dwarfs the seriousness of government-run, government-hijacked healthcare 20% of the economy.
[03:08:34.219 --> 03:08:42.103]  As important as that is, it is nothing compared to open world government run for
[03:08:44.036 --> 03:08:47.397]  And buy a private inner group of central banks.
[03:08:47.397 --> 03:08:48.017]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:08:48.017 --> 03:08:51.238]  I was watching CNN this morning on the treadmill.
[03:08:51.238 --> 03:08:54.979]  And they were admitting, yeah, the dollar may die like Argentina.
[03:08:54.979 --> 03:08:58.839]  And we need to have a new world reserve currency the UN's calling for.
[03:08:58.839 --> 03:09:00.360]  But don't believe me.
[03:09:00.360 --> 03:09:07.542]  Just Google the term UN calls for replacing the dollar with new currency.
[03:09:07.542 --> 03:09:09.202]  And you'll see AP Reuters.
[03:09:10.458 --> 03:09:13.879]  We cover that in the Obama deception that's been out for six months.
[03:09:13.879 --> 03:09:23.563]  And when we released the Obama deception, they were hot and heavy, not on the health care takeover, but on the banking reform.
[03:09:23.563 --> 03:09:28.165]  Now, six months ago, they'd only stolen about $10 trillion.
[03:09:28.165 --> 03:09:30.426]  In six months.
[03:09:30.426 --> 03:09:31.767]  Now they've stolen $23.7 trillion.
[03:09:31.767 --> 03:09:32.347]  $23.7 trillion.
[03:09:39.137 --> 03:09:41.629]  Seven trillion, ten and a half months into the bailout.
[03:09:42.674 --> 03:09:47.097]  And look at that headline, London Telegraph, UN wants new global currency to replace dollar.
[03:09:47.097 --> 03:09:54.761]  I just want to put that up there for people that are still in denial, because the media for decades called anybody a lunatic kook.
[03:09:54.761 --> 03:10:06.808]  If you read UN documents, if you read Club of Rome documents, if you read CFR documents, if you read articles out of Money magazine where they were calling for it, it didn't exist, you were a liar.
[03:10:06.808 --> 03:10:08.529]  Well now they're announcing it on CNN,
[03:10:09.810 --> 03:10:19.478]  And saying, look, we got to have this next banking reform or we're going to have another bubble and you'll lose your 401k.
[03:10:19.478 --> 03:10:21.140]  What did I tell you in the Obama deception?
[03:10:21.140 --> 03:10:25.083]  What did I tell you last year when they had the October 3rd banker takeover?
[03:10:25.083 --> 03:10:32.089]  I said, they're going to plunge the market, pump it back up with the tens of trillions they steal.
[03:10:32.089 --> 03:10:35.332]  The banks are making record profits, but Main Street is dying.
[03:10:37.918 --> 03:10:46.240]  The layoffs, the job losses, the stores closing, the real economy Main Street is dying.
[03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:48.641]  Vertical integration is happening.
[03:10:48.641 --> 03:11:03.745]  Only a handful of central banks, there's only really seven big ones, are consolidating all the small banks, the infrastructures, bankrupting the states, bankrupting individuals and consolidating everything.
[03:11:03.745 --> 03:11:05.646]  And they had the financial expert
[03:11:06.790 --> 03:11:20.800]  On CNN this morning, the ball-headed guy wearing a pin-striped suit, whatever his name is, admitting everything, but like it was good!
[03:11:20.800 --> 03:11:30.647]  Oh, the big banks are consolidating and buying everything up with the money they have, and they're going to fix it, we're going to have a new Bank of the World, and I was sitting there watching it while I was jogging, and just couldn't believe it!
[03:11:32.546 --> 03:11:35.929]  So everything we told you about has now come true.
[03:11:35.929 --> 03:11:38.371]  And Obama gave his speech earlier in the first hour.
[03:11:38.371 --> 03:11:40.813]  We played some clips of it live.
[03:11:40.813 --> 03:11:42.575]  Some excerpts.
[03:11:42.575 --> 03:11:45.598]  We went to it live several times.
[03:11:45.598 --> 03:11:45.738]  And
[03:11:47.711 --> 03:12:02.221]  He's saying they're going to get tough on the banks and stop derivatives ever happening again, when in truth, Geithner was the head of the New York Fed, the real federal branch of the private Federal Reserve that actually has power in New York.
[03:12:02.221 --> 03:12:07.524]  Bernanke was Fed Chairman over the entire system.
[03:12:07.524 --> 03:12:12.708]  They told Bush exactly what to do, and there was complete coordination between
[03:12:14.218 --> 03:12:25.265]  Geithner and Bernanke and Bush and then Obama and then Obama appointed people even closer to the scam than Bush had had.
[03:12:25.265 --> 03:12:31.629]  But it's kind of like Obama's people are the lead bank robber and Bush was in the getaway car.
[03:12:31.629 --> 03:12:35.411]  I mean, you know, I'm not being partisan saying who was more guilty.
[03:12:35.411 --> 03:12:42.275]  They're all total puppets robbing the bank for the mob boss down the road living in his palace.
[03:12:42.275 --> 03:12:43.216]  That's the New World Order.
[03:12:44.989 --> 03:12:49.090]  I mean, this is complete fraud.
[03:12:49.090 --> 03:12:53.071]  Complete, total fraud.
[03:12:53.071 --> 03:13:01.214]  The exact Clinton bankers that made the rule changes, Bush then protected them while they were looting for eight years.
[03:13:01.214 --> 03:13:05.115]  Again, seamless integration between Clinton, Bush, Obama.
[03:13:05.115 --> 03:13:06.876]  Totally on the same team.
[03:13:06.876 --> 03:13:08.356]  Total coordination.
[03:13:08.356 --> 03:13:10.637]  They even testified in Congress on this.
[03:13:11.747 --> 03:13:13.388]  No difference!
[03:13:13.388 --> 03:13:31.455]  Except they knew Obama would be a better person to sell it to the American people, so he got four times the Wall Street Journal, the Wall Street money from Wall Street brokerage firms and banks, according to the Wall Street Journal, than Obama did.
[03:13:31.455 --> 03:13:35.076]  Again, Obama got four times more than McCain.
[03:13:37.347 --> 03:13:40.670]  And that was because they knew he could sell the fraud.
[03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:42.571]  Not that McCain was good.
[03:13:42.571 --> 03:13:47.855]  They were loading an arrow in their crossbow, saying, which arrow is the most vicious I've got?
[03:13:47.855 --> 03:13:50.096]  Which one will take down America the best?
[03:13:50.096 --> 03:13:51.618]  Which one can con these suckers?
[03:13:51.618 --> 03:13:52.939]  All right, this is the one.
[03:13:52.939 --> 03:13:57.122]  Let me load it.
[03:13:57.122 --> 03:13:58.062]  Powerful crossbow.
[03:13:58.062 --> 03:14:00.444]  Let me load Obama into the groove.
[03:14:00.444 --> 03:14:02.706]  All right, here comes that dumbass public.
[03:14:03.666 --> 03:14:04.667]  Boom!
[03:14:04.667 --> 03:14:07.248]  And I mean, it's just like, wham!
[03:14:07.248 --> 03:14:09.829]  Pull up a video of a deer getting shot by a crossbow.
[03:14:09.829 --> 03:14:15.352]  You can go to YouTube and say, deer hunting with crossbow.
[03:14:15.352 --> 03:14:30.359]  And the deer hunters, the New World Order, Obama's the arrow, David Rockefeller, the big new Brzezinski, and Jay Rockefeller, and the Queen of England, the Queen of the Netherlands, it's all a big joke to them, the Rothschilds as well, they are the hunter.
[03:14:30.359 --> 03:14:33.001]  And they got a crossbow that's our government,
[03:14:33.717 --> 03:14:43.348]  They've built the government to be big and powerful, to be able to knock the Republic down, and they load a Bush in and they shoot it into us, they load an Obama in.
[03:14:43.348 --> 03:14:46.392]  That's all they are, is a weapon.
[03:14:46.392 --> 03:14:53.920]  But before we go to that, I wanted to play a short clip of Glenn Beck endorsing the banker bailout bill.
[03:14:53.920 --> 03:14:54.281]  Here it is.
[03:14:55.828 --> 03:14:57.768]  I think the bailout is the right thing to do.
[03:14:57.768 --> 03:15:00.789]  I believe so deeply in our Constitution.
[03:15:00.789 --> 03:15:02.470]  I was for the Patriot Act.
[03:15:02.470 --> 03:15:06.290]  You know that I am actually a libertarian at heart.
[03:15:06.290 --> 03:15:14.612]  The 700 billion dollars that you're hearing about now is not only, I believe, necessary, it is also not nearly enough.
[03:15:14.612 --> 03:15:18.933]  There was one guy last year that was Ron Paul.
[03:15:18.933 --> 03:15:20.274]  And then he demonizes Ron Paul.
[03:15:20.274 --> 03:15:20.754]  That's enough.
[03:15:21.442 --> 03:15:23.023]  There's nothing worse than two faces.
[03:15:23.023 --> 03:15:27.224]  So, there's your savior that's leading your movement.
[03:15:27.224 --> 03:15:32.286]  They've put him there and made him the leader so he can lead you off, is the point.
[03:15:32.286 --> 03:15:39.049]  Now, let's play somebody from Fox who they keep in the basement on internet TV.
[03:15:39.049 --> 03:15:43.670]  And most of the public is so dumbed down they don't know this is internet only.
[03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:46.972]  I've been on his show once, not again, even though he liked it.
[03:15:46.972 --> 03:15:48.992]  I know the higher-ups put the kibosh on that.
[03:15:48.992 --> 03:15:49.953]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:15:49.953 --> 03:15:50.573]  The point is,
[03:15:52.003 --> 03:15:55.027]  Judge Napolitano.
[03:15:55.027 --> 03:15:58.331]  He's not perfect, but he is definitely not a Benedict Arnold.
[03:15:58.331 --> 03:16:05.138]  Now, what did he say about the bailout, and more importantly, Obama's new regulatory reform?
[03:16:05.138 --> 03:16:09.884]  He said this a few months ago, literally a week after we published this article.
[03:16:10.945 --> 03:16:17.711]  Obama regulatory reform plan officially establishes banking dictatorship in the United States.
[03:16:17.711 --> 03:16:34.045]  And I said from a hot dog stand to a car dealership, it states in the legislation Obama introduced that the private banking consortium gives the Federal Reserve control over every facet of the economy.
[03:16:34.045 --> 03:16:34.906]  That's what the bill read.
[03:16:37.918 --> 03:16:40.935]  Napolitano told the truth, and here is that piece.
[03:16:44.286 --> 03:16:53.594]  I'm Judge Andrew Napolitano and the verdict is coming on President Barack Obama's historic plan to overhaul and regulate our financial institutions.
[03:16:53.594 --> 03:16:54.855]  Here's the question.
[03:16:54.855 --> 03:17:01.400]  What is left out of this proposal is, and what we deserve to know is, who will regulate the Federal Reserve?
[03:17:01.400 --> 03:17:08.125]  What will become of clauses in the Constitution that prohibit the very type of regulation the President wants?
[03:17:08.125 --> 03:17:12.249]  And what is now the meaning of the word free in free market?
[03:17:13.336 --> 03:17:14.676]  Here are the facts.
[03:17:14.676 --> 03:17:19.278]  The bias of the drafters of this proposal is that the government knows best.
[03:17:19.278 --> 03:17:29.401]  The Constitution should not be an obstacle to the egalitarian goals of the government, and no private behavior is beyond the government's reach of its huge hand.
[03:17:29.401 --> 03:17:42.125]  The essence of the proposal is to give the Federal Reserve the authority to regulate any aspect of any firms that in its discretion, its sole discretion, could adversely affect the economy if they fail.
[03:17:42.785 --> 03:17:49.127]  The Fed would thus be the only unregulated private entity on the planet.
[03:17:49.127 --> 03:17:57.870]  This private, super-secret bank, half of whose board is appointed by the President, is the most secret aspect in all of the government.
[03:17:57.870 --> 03:17:58.831]  Think about it.
[03:17:58.831 --> 03:18:03.513]  The job of the CIA is to steal and to keep secrets.
[03:18:03.513 --> 03:18:07.114]  But we know more about the CIA than we do the Federal Reserve.
[03:18:07.754 --> 03:18:18.700]  The Federal Reserve is a private, completely unregulated bank, into which the Obama administration proposes to repose all regulatory authority.
[03:18:18.700 --> 03:18:26.805]  From the compensation of executives, to the investments companies make, to the location of their franchises, are you ready for this?
[03:18:26.805 --> 03:18:30.927]  To the amount of fat in McDonald's cheeseburgers.
[03:18:30.927 --> 03:18:34.710]  Without appeal, and without stating reasons for the regulations.
[03:18:35.590 --> 03:18:46.660]  All grouped investments, even if the investors own the group, like hedge funds, like you and your neighbors getting together to buy a house, will be subject to the Fed's new rules.
[03:18:46.660 --> 03:18:50.143]  All state-chartered banks will now be subject to the Fed.
[03:18:50.143 --> 03:18:58.270]  All businesses, whether financial in nature or not, that are owned by any financial institutions, shall be subject to the Fed.
[03:18:59.071 --> 03:19:12.839]  Even mom-and-pop shops and stores, if in the Fed's opinion could fail and thus produce systemic harm to the economy, shall be subject to the rule of the Fed.
[03:19:12.839 --> 03:19:21.425]  The Fed shall have the authority to require lawyers and accountants to report data to the Fed that even the IRS presently lacks.
[03:19:22.352 --> 03:19:31.979]  There appears to be no limit to the private human behavior that the Fed will not be able to find a way to regulate under this proposal.
[03:19:33.422 --> 03:19:36.566]  You want to hear more of opinions such as these, take a look at my...
[03:20:02.827 --> 03:20:03.949]  We're good.
[03:20:17.827 --> 03:20:18.648]  We're good to go!
[03:20:42.365 --> 03:20:47.728]  And in this economy, saving money is always welcome, especially when it comes to our food supply.

[03:21:12.722 --> 03:21:15.623]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:21:15.623 --> 03:21:19.265]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:21:28.900 --> 03:21:33.786]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:21:33.786 --> 03:21:34.887]  An inside job.
[03:21:37.561 --> 03:21:40.002]  How dare you?
[03:21:40.002 --> 03:21:45.084]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:21:45.084 --> 03:21:47.965]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:21:47.965 --> 03:21:54.448]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[03:21:59.550 --> 03:22:02.771]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:22:02.771 --> 03:22:05.452]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:22:07.500 --> 03:22:07.920]  I think so.
[03:22:23.456 --> 03:22:23.936]  I think so.
[03:22:52.495 --> 03:22:55.238]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:22:55.238 --> 03:22:55.879]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[03:23:02.688 --> 03:23:04.249]  Are you constantly tired?
[03:23:04.249 --> 03:23:06.111]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[03:23:06.111 --> 03:23:09.393]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[03:23:09.393 --> 03:23:12.435]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:23:12.435 --> 03:23:19.080]  Liquid Zeolite, available only at RestoreYourHealthNow.com, captures toxins and physically carries them out of your body.
[03:23:19.080 --> 03:23:23.704]  This safe and effective way of detoxifying can easily remove heavy metals and contaminants.
[03:23:23.704 --> 03:23:31.970]  Studies show that Liquid Zeolite captures triggering antigens which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[03:23:32.110 --> 03:23:32.890]  I'm good to go.
[03:24:08.573 --> 03:24:10.594]  More of your calls coming up in the next segment.
[03:24:10.594 --> 03:24:16.939]  We've got Rob Duke popping in, one of the producers, to give us some reports on what's in the new flu shot.
[03:24:16.939 --> 03:24:28.346]  We've got some more guests coming up this week and next week on that subject as they get ready to try to push forced inoculations in this country.
[03:24:28.346 --> 03:24:30.528]  But I just played what Napolitano said.
[03:24:31.741 --> 03:24:36.967]  And his producers have told me they listen to the show, they like the show, they picked up on our analysis and went and looked at the bill.
[03:24:36.967 --> 03:24:38.729]  We're glad they did that.
[03:24:38.729 --> 03:24:43.114]  But Glenn Beck is going to be supporting the banker takeover bill, you better believe it.
[03:24:43.114 --> 03:24:46.057]  And that's how the media is going to phrase this.
[03:24:46.057 --> 03:24:49.561]  Look, we stopped the depression with what the banks just did.
[03:24:49.561 --> 03:24:52.985]  In truth, the banks hoarded all the money and are killing Main Street right now.
[03:24:53.425 --> 03:24:57.087]  But the banks are doing good, so they call that a good economy.
[03:24:57.087 --> 03:24:58.828]  The jobless recovery.
[03:24:58.828 --> 03:25:08.232]  You live in soup kitchens, and you lose your job, or you take a cut in pay, and the bankers make trillions off your back in tax money, and then they set up FEMA camps.
[03:25:08.232 --> 03:25:10.914]  That's the new economy.
[03:25:10.914 --> 03:25:13.535]  So that's what they're pushing, that's what they're setting up.
[03:25:18.991 --> 03:25:26.533]  And they're gonna say now, okay, the depression's gonna get worse if you don't do this.
[03:25:26.533 --> 03:25:30.934]  We're gonna kill the economy if you don't submit to us.
[03:25:30.934 --> 03:25:36.075]  It's like in Blazing Saddles where the sheriff's surrounded and he says, drop your guns or I'll shoot myself.
[03:25:36.075 --> 03:25:39.795]  But they're not really gonna shoot themselves, they're gonna shoot our country in the head.
[03:25:39.795 --> 03:25:42.556]  These are criminals feeding on the planet.
[03:25:42.556 --> 03:25:47.257]  Now this story, written by Paul Watson and Steve Watson,
[03:25:48.888 --> 03:25:51.689]  From my breakdown of the facts is key.
[03:25:51.689 --> 03:25:58.953]  Obama regulatory reform plan officially establishes banking dictatorship in the United States.
[03:25:58.953 --> 03:26:12.159]  And I'm asking everybody to go get this article from June 18th, 3-4 months ago, and to get it out to everybody again, along with the Napolitano video that we just played.
[03:26:13.633 --> 03:26:20.462]  I'm asking everybody to go and get this, so people understand what's about to happen.
[03:26:20.462 --> 03:26:27.331]  Because if the foreign offshore banks get a total dictatorial power in the country, it's going to be rough.
[03:26:27.331 --> 03:26:31.336]  Either we abolish the Fed and arrest the bankers, or they're going to keep growing like a cancer.
[03:26:32.708 --> 03:26:38.813]  President Obama's plan to give the private-owned and unaccountable Federal Reserve complete regulatory oversight across the entire U.S.
[03:26:38.813 --> 03:26:54.686]  economy, which is likely to be enacted before the end of the year, now they're trying it, will officially herald the beginning of a new form of government in the United States, an ultra-powerful banking dictatorship controlled by a small gaggle of shadowy and corrupt elitists.
[03:26:54.686 --> 03:27:02.152]  The new rules would see the Fed given the authority to regulate any company whose activity it believes could threaten the economy and the markets.
[03:27:03.476 --> 03:27:06.601]  Yeah, but see, this is the group threatening the markets.
[03:27:06.601 --> 03:27:08.243]  This is the group that's done this.
[03:27:08.243 --> 03:27:09.986]  This is the group that did the derivatives.
[03:27:09.986 --> 03:27:12.529]  But now they're given, oh, total power to save us!
[03:27:14.178 --> 03:27:23.047]  That goes a step further than the centrally planned economies of the Soviet Union or Communist China, in that the Federal Reserve is not even accountable to the U.S.
[03:27:23.047 --> 03:27:23.828]  government.
[03:27:23.828 --> 03:27:33.137]  It is a private entity that, according to the former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, is accountable to no one but the banking families that own it.
[03:27:33.137 --> 03:27:34.999]  And he said that on Laird NewsHour.
[03:27:36.716 --> 03:27:53.152]  Obama's regulatory reform plan is nothing less than a green light for the complete and total takeover of the United States by a private banking cartel that will usurp the power of existing regulatory bodies who are now being blamed for the financial crisis in order that their status can be
[03:27:54.531 --> 03:27:58.772]  Abolished and their roles handed over to the all-powerful Federal Reserve.
[03:27:58.772 --> 03:28:05.073]  And it goes on for page after page after page after page of detailed analysis.
[03:28:05.073 --> 03:28:13.195]  I'm going to read a little bit more here, but the issue is either we say no to the government takeover of health care.
[03:28:13.195 --> 03:28:15.155]  That's just a new tax to the banks.
[03:28:15.155 --> 03:28:20.056]  They're just going to take over health care, water it down, take 20% of your paycheck extra.
[03:28:20.056 --> 03:28:22.137]  You're not going to get jack crap back.
[03:28:22.137 --> 03:28:22.417]  Okay?
[03:28:24.807 --> 03:28:40.817]  There's that, there's this banking takeover, there's the expansion of the wars, there's the Cyber Security Act taking over the internet, there's the Cyber Bullying Act, free speech ending, hate bills pass the house, openly says
[03:28:42.958 --> 03:28:44.879]  You don't even have to call for anything criminal.
[03:28:44.879 --> 03:28:46.119]  You still get arrested.
[03:28:46.119 --> 03:28:48.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's all happening.
[03:28:48.620 --> 03:28:52.842]  It's all 180 degrees away from freedom.
[03:28:52.842 --> 03:28:56.763]  In fact, cut to a close shot for me real fast right here.
[03:28:56.763 --> 03:28:58.784]  Okay, here is the political system.
[03:28:58.784 --> 03:29:05.487]  Okay, here is the political system symbolized as a circle.
[03:29:05.487 --> 03:29:05.787]  Okay?
[03:29:10.469 --> 03:29:13.950]  When we come back, I'm going to get into it for everybody.
[03:29:13.950 --> 03:29:21.852]  But here is the political system symbolized as a circle.
[03:29:21.852 --> 03:29:27.454]  And I'll show you tyranny versus liberty when we get back after this quick break.
[03:29:27.454 --> 03:29:28.975]  On the other side.
[03:29:28.975 --> 03:29:31.675]  Again, the websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:29:33.635 --> 03:29:36.596]  And we're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:29:36.596 --> 03:29:37.636]  to 3 p.m.
[03:29:37.636 --> 03:29:38.216]  Central.
[03:29:38.216 --> 03:29:40.897]  We don't have the big New World Order media promoting us.
[03:29:40.897 --> 03:29:48.620]  We reach new listeners one person at a time by you telling your neighbors, your friends, your family, your email list about this radio show.
[03:29:48.620 --> 03:29:50.040]  So keep spreading the word.
[03:29:50.040 --> 03:29:51.701]  The show is exploding in size.
[03:29:51.701 --> 03:29:53.101]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.101 --> 03:29:55.622]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.622 --> 03:29:58.323]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.164 --> 03:30:06.471]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.471 --> 03:30:08.554]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[03:30:08.554 --> 03:30:10.997]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:10.997 --> 03:30:13.280]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.280 --> 03:30:14.902]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:14.902 --> 03:30:15.944]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.164 --> 03:30:24.593]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:30:38.067 --> 03:30:44.093]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[03:31:01.741 --> 03:31:03.744]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:31:03.744 --> 03:31:07.369]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:31:07.369 --> 03:31:09.712]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:31:09.712 --> 03:31:12.896]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:31:12.896 --> 03:31:16.681]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[03:31:16.681 --> 03:31:17.021]  We're good.
[03:31:46.681 --> 03:31:48.221]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:31:48.221 --> 03:31:49.822]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:31:49.822 --> 03:31:52.363]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:31:52.363 --> 03:31:56.844]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:32:13.334 --> 03:32:16.537]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[03:32:16.537 --> 03:32:32.992]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[03:32:32.992 --> 03:32:35.314]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[03:32:35.314 --> 03:32:36.736]  I use one every day.
[03:32:36.736 --> 03:32:39.178]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[03:32:39.418 --> 03:32:39.979]  We're good.
[03:33:11.038 --> 03:33:14.540]  The establishment gets you obsessed with left and right.
[03:33:14.540 --> 03:33:17.401]  Those are two wings on the same bird of prey.
[03:33:17.401 --> 03:33:19.642]  How about focusing on the bird's head?
[03:33:19.642 --> 03:33:21.202]  On its mind?
[03:33:21.202 --> 03:33:23.503]  On what controls those wings?
[03:33:23.503 --> 03:33:28.385]  We didn't have a left-right system until a hundred years ago, roughly, in this country and in the world.
[03:33:28.385 --> 03:33:30.286]  It was liberty versus tyranny.
[03:33:30.286 --> 03:33:34.068]  Populism versus elitism.
[03:33:34.068 --> 03:33:37.569]  Who that person worked for.
[03:33:37.569 --> 03:33:38.850]  What that person stood for.
[03:33:41.246 --> 03:33:45.927]  And governments generally used wars to suppress their own domestic populations.
[03:33:45.927 --> 03:33:56.729]  There are even articles, letters written 500, 600, 700 years ago by different British royals to their French cousins saying, yes, we're having rebellions here, we need to start a new war.
[03:33:56.729 --> 03:33:58.729]  Okay, how about next spring?
[03:33:58.729 --> 03:34:02.230]  Then it'll be nice weather for me to ride out and meet you.
[03:34:02.230 --> 03:34:05.270]  It was elites killing their own populations.
[03:34:05.270 --> 03:34:10.471]  They were one family in France, the Norman, that had already conquered England.
[03:34:11.380 --> 03:34:16.841]  And they were just out there killing their enemy, the people, in the staged war.
[03:34:16.841 --> 03:34:18.522]  They wrote books about it.
[03:34:18.522 --> 03:34:20.662]  But here is the modern fraudulent system.
[03:34:20.662 --> 03:34:25.003]  There's different ways to explain this, but the left-right paradigm.
[03:34:25.003 --> 03:34:31.585]  So this circle symbolizes the total political system within the control paradigm.
[03:34:31.585 --> 03:34:37.586]  And you have tyranny on one side of the spectrum, and you have freedom or liberty on the other.
[03:34:38.689 --> 03:34:43.993]  And then you have the left on one side and the right on the other.
[03:34:43.993 --> 03:34:54.141]  Now, the right can be pushed by the people, because it's only a term, to manifest towards freedom.
[03:34:54.141 --> 03:34:59.485]  Or it can be pushed to manifest towards tyranny.
[03:34:59.485 --> 03:35:04.409]  The left can be influenced by the people to push
[03:35:05.407 --> 03:35:06.968]  For freedom?
[03:35:06.968 --> 03:35:08.049]  Or for tyranny?
[03:35:08.049 --> 03:35:09.269]  And so they confuse you.
[03:35:09.269 --> 03:35:18.535]  And generally, when the left is out of power under George Bush for eight years, they can be against the Patriot Act and wars and secret arrest.
[03:35:18.535 --> 03:35:22.437]  But as soon as they're in power, they're suddenly for it all.
[03:35:22.437 --> 03:35:28.580]  Just like Republicans under Bill Clinton could be against the police state and Patriot Act type legislation.
[03:35:28.580 --> 03:35:30.181]  John Ashcroft was against it.
[03:35:30.181 --> 03:35:34.344]  But as soon as he's in power, now they go for
[03:35:35.686 --> 03:35:38.568]  The tyranny.
[03:35:38.568 --> 03:35:54.519]  And so while they're confusing us, getting us to fight with each other over left and right, we're not involved within this system with the real debate of is it freedom or is it tyranny?
[03:35:54.519 --> 03:36:05.346]  Because this whole left-right system as they move back and forth towards tyranny or towards freedom and liberty is just something to confuse the people.
[03:36:06.872 --> 03:36:08.874]  So let's see where Glenn Beck is.
[03:36:08.874 --> 03:36:12.477]  Glenn Beck was for the banker bailout.
[03:36:12.477 --> 03:36:14.558]  Glenn Beck was for the Patriot Act.
[03:36:14.558 --> 03:36:19.763]  Glenn Beck was for the war.
[03:36:19.763 --> 03:36:21.664]  He's for tyranny.
[03:36:21.664 --> 03:36:26.508]  Okay, so he's supposedly on the right, and he's for all these things.
[03:36:26.508 --> 03:36:28.410]  Now what is Obama for?
[03:36:28.410 --> 03:36:29.291]  For the war.
[03:36:29.291 --> 03:36:30.211]  For the Patriot Act.
[03:36:30.211 --> 03:36:31.633]  For warrantless wiretapping.
[03:36:31.633 --> 03:36:32.934]  For the banker bailout.
[03:36:32.934 --> 03:36:35.356]  When you actually look at real issues,
[03:36:36.983 --> 03:36:45.730]  These guys are 100% the same.
[03:36:45.730 --> 03:36:53.456]  But they'll throw a Van Jones to the Lions in the left-right gladiatorial arena.
[03:36:53.456 --> 03:36:54.777]  That's all this is.
[03:36:54.777 --> 03:37:01.082]  They'll have Van Jones, the little gladiator, get hacked up by Glenn Beck
[03:37:02.233 --> 03:37:12.821]  The bigger gladiator, who's got the big sword, he'll hack Van Jones up and give you a whole left-right show.
[03:37:12.821 --> 03:37:15.203]  You guys are laughing, is this a good analogy?
[03:37:15.203 --> 03:37:17.665]  Because if you look, that's all this is, is an arena.
[03:37:17.665 --> 03:37:22.429]  I'm asking people to get outside the box.
[03:37:22.429 --> 03:37:26.752]  And to have a larger debate about tyranny and freedom.
[03:37:26.752 --> 03:37:29.294]  Tyranny and liberty, which side you're on.
[03:37:29.294 --> 03:37:30.255]  Oppression and freedom.
[03:37:32.554 --> 03:37:36.957]  Okay, there's my analogy.
[03:37:36.957 --> 03:37:48.343]  Brought to you by InfoWars.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:48.343 --> 03:37:51.745]  And we'll give them a cigarette to smoke, there we go, or something else.
[03:37:51.745 --> 03:37:54.787]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:54.787 --> 03:37:59.850]  There's the boil down, but I do challenge everybody to go get this article.
[03:38:01.078 --> 03:38:06.602]  Titled, Obama Regulatory Reform Plan Officially Establishes Banking Dictatorship in the United States.
[03:38:06.602 --> 03:38:14.987]  I want to challenge all of you to get this out to everybody, because while we're diverted and distracted by healthcare, they've decided for now to pull that off the front burner.
[03:38:14.987 --> 03:38:21.311]  They may try to sneak it through on the budget, but that's pretty much a dead issue right now.
[03:38:21.311 --> 03:38:23.492]  They're going to go now for the banking takeover.
[03:38:23.492 --> 03:38:24.753]  That's the big enchilada.
[03:38:24.753 --> 03:38:26.334]  They tried four or five months ago.
[03:38:26.334 --> 03:38:28.155]  It failed.
[03:38:28.155 --> 03:38:29.236]  They're coming back again.
[03:38:30.643 --> 03:38:33.424]  Just like they do with Amnesty.
[03:38:33.424 --> 03:38:34.784]  So, that's the bottom line.
[03:38:34.784 --> 03:38:37.225]  We'll cover it more.
[03:38:37.225 --> 03:38:45.168]  But Glenn Beck and others are going to be focusing in on firing different czars or things.
[03:38:45.168 --> 03:38:49.889]  They all want you to focus on the puppet, Obama.
[03:38:49.889 --> 03:38:54.691]  By the way, conversely, they don't just have Glenn Beck crushing the smaller gladiator.
[03:38:57.216 --> 03:38:58.778]  of Van Jones.
[03:38:58.778 --> 03:39:00.880]  See, this is Beck, this is Jones.
[03:39:00.880 --> 03:39:08.407]  Obama then, later, he gets to be a bigger gladiator and a puppet, and he gets to crush Beck.
[03:39:08.407 --> 03:39:19.058]  And then later, a phony Republican leader, he gets to come along and crush Beck.
[03:39:20.691 --> 03:39:26.893]  He has to come along and crush Obama, who crushed Beck, and then there'll be another Democratic leader that crushes him.
[03:39:26.893 --> 03:39:35.457]  This is all a diversion while you're in the bleachers watching your liberty be destroyed inside the gladiatorial system.
[03:39:35.457 --> 03:39:38.198]  That is an incredibly good picture right there.
[03:39:38.198 --> 03:39:40.098]  Alright, that's enough.
[03:39:40.098 --> 03:39:42.779]  Let's bring Rob Dew in.
[03:39:42.779 --> 03:39:44.940]  Rob is coming in.
[03:39:44.940 --> 03:39:46.381]  It'll take him a moment to get situated.
[03:39:47.679 --> 03:39:49.321]  Yes, we're going to do a bunch of flu shows.
[03:39:49.321 --> 03:39:51.564]  We've done a bunch of flu shows.
[03:39:51.564 --> 03:39:58.673]  We're going to cover a bunch of flu news coming up this week and next week with a bunch of other medical doctors and Tenpenny.
[03:40:00.253 --> 03:40:06.398]  Quayle, who's not a doctor, but Horowitz and others are going to be coming on to go over all of this.
[03:40:06.398 --> 03:40:08.340]  But yes, there's mercury in it.
[03:40:08.340 --> 03:40:11.302]  Yes, it's causing all sorts of illnesses in the trials.
[03:40:11.302 --> 03:40:15.105]  Yes, they're planning on forced inoculations.
[03:40:15.105 --> 03:40:18.468]  Tell folks, Rob, what this particular document is here you have.
[03:40:18.468 --> 03:40:21.250]  Alright, I got a document sent to us.
[03:40:21.250 --> 03:40:27.755]  It's entitled H1N1 Panavax Swine Flu Vaccine, and this was given out to healthcare workers in Australia, mainly.
[03:40:28.524 --> 03:40:32.108]  And it's to train them on how to administer the vaccine, the schedules.
[03:40:32.108 --> 03:40:33.909]  It's the same one, H1N1 Panavax.
[03:40:33.909 --> 03:40:34.410]  Show folks.
[03:40:34.410 --> 03:40:35.511]  Yeah, Panavax.
[03:40:35.511 --> 03:40:38.854]  There's the PDF that, uh, Government of Western Australia.
[03:40:38.854 --> 03:40:38.994]  Yeah.
[03:40:38.994 --> 03:40:45.821]  And we got the same, this is all a carbon copy, just with local rules, of the Level 6 UN document we've covered on here.
[03:40:45.821 --> 03:40:46.742]  Right, exactly.
[03:40:46.742 --> 03:40:48.784]  Oh, and look what the witches are making!
[03:40:48.784 --> 03:40:51.186]  Right, slide 16 is a pretty interesting one.
[03:40:51.186 --> 03:40:52.287]  It's got the witches brewing.
[03:40:52.287 --> 03:40:52.988]  It says, what's in it?
[03:40:53.707 --> 03:41:03.954]  And it lists the stuff that's in there, and on slide 18 it admits that there's thimerosal, and that it can be toxic after it reaches certain levels in the body.
[03:41:03.954 --> 03:41:08.777]  And it said, but there's no evidence that it'll cause neurological developments or abnormalities.
[03:41:08.777 --> 03:41:10.939]  Yeah, they just admit that mercury does it.
[03:41:10.939 --> 03:41:12.120]  It's toxic.
[03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:14.061]  But it won't cause these specific things.
[03:41:14.061 --> 03:41:16.423]  It's not going to cause ADHD or autism.
[03:41:17.603 --> 03:41:20.149]  And then they made changes.
[03:41:20.149 --> 03:41:23.176]  Basically, they want to give the younger kids two doses of the vaccine.
[03:41:23.176 --> 03:41:25.341]  If you're 10 or older, they only want to give you one dose.
[03:41:26.297 --> 03:41:29.439]  Well, here it's three, Dr. Obama says.
[03:41:29.439 --> 03:41:32.862]  And again, we're not saying there's going to be quarantines and forced inoculations.
[03:41:32.862 --> 03:41:35.444]  The government is saying they're preparing for it.
[03:41:35.444 --> 03:41:42.909]  We're trying to politically get the word out so the enforcers, the nurses, the doctors, the police say no, so the whole program falls through.
[03:41:42.909 --> 03:41:46.572]  And that's now starting to happen, but we're not out of the woods yet.
[03:41:46.572 --> 03:41:49.154]  We're in the fight, but we're not out of the woods yet here.
[03:41:49.534 --> 03:41:52.677]  Yeah, so we're going to put this document up online.
[03:41:52.677 --> 03:41:59.343]  Kurt's going to... I sent it to him with a little article on the slides that I thought were more interesting, you know, for people to look at and educate themselves.
[03:41:59.343 --> 03:42:00.804]  So take a look at it.
[03:42:00.804 --> 03:42:03.266]  It's about 80 pages long, but it's a quick read.
[03:42:03.266 --> 03:42:07.930]  It's a slideshow, basically, from a company called CSL.
[03:42:07.930 --> 03:42:11.994]  They're one of the biggest manufacturers of the vaccine in the Southern Hemisphere.
[03:42:11.994 --> 03:42:13.435]  So they stand to make a lot of money, of course.
[03:42:16.872 --> 03:42:18.872]  We're now going into full-swing flu season.
[03:42:18.872 --> 03:42:21.553]  It's killed not even a thousand people yet in the U.S.
[03:42:21.553 --> 03:42:23.853]  Regular flu kills 30-something thou.
[03:42:23.853 --> 03:42:27.054]  Why are we taking a vaccine for this?
[03:42:27.054 --> 03:42:30.795]  Well, we know they've been caught before adding cancer viruses and sterilants to them.
[03:42:30.795 --> 03:42:36.396]  And the White House science czar, in his own book, Ecoscience, calls for it.
[03:42:36.396 --> 03:42:38.316]  What does that sound like to you?
[03:42:38.316 --> 03:42:39.497]  Sounds like eugenics.
[03:42:39.497 --> 03:42:40.497]  Let's roll our sleeves.
[03:42:40.497 --> 03:42:42.197]  No, let's drink the fluoride.
[03:42:42.197 --> 03:42:44.438]  I mean, you know, it only causes bone cancer and brain damage.
[03:42:44.438 --> 03:42:45.678]  I mean, let's trust them.
[03:42:45.678 --> 03:42:45.918]  Come on.
[03:42:46.846 --> 03:42:51.530]  Yeah, and they even list pregnant women, indigenous people, health care workers.
[03:42:51.530 --> 03:42:53.371]  Oh, they needed it especially, those indigenous people.
[03:42:53.371 --> 03:42:54.172]  Yeah, indigenous people.
[03:42:54.172 --> 03:42:57.715]  I thought that was interesting that they just put indigenous people on there.
[03:42:57.715 --> 03:43:03.279]  And by the way, the autoimmune disorders that vaccines cause when a woman is pregnant, you're never supposed to take vaccines when you're pregnant.
[03:43:03.279 --> 03:43:03.999]  Right.
[03:43:03.999 --> 03:43:05.701]  And what do you think of my artwork?
[03:43:05.701 --> 03:43:07.082]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[03:43:07.082 --> 03:43:09.043]  Do you go to the Art Institute?
[03:43:09.043 --> 03:43:11.285]  It is, it's nice.
[03:43:11.285 --> 03:43:15.709]  It really illustrates the paradigm of the squared circle.
[03:43:16.636 --> 03:43:31.501]  Maybe somebody like one of the great directors out there like Nuff Respect will take it and turn it into an animation like he did with my Left Right Paradigm one before where I described it as a pillar instead of as a gladiatorial arena.
[03:43:31.501 --> 03:43:35.562]  That would be interesting and then just take shots of gladiator people getting hacked to death.
[03:43:37.088 --> 03:43:38.509]  Anyway, that's going to be up.
[03:43:38.509 --> 03:43:39.469]  Kurt's going to post that.
[03:43:39.469 --> 03:43:40.250]  Hey, look at this!
[03:43:40.250 --> 03:43:47.014]  Even the Mail Online, big newspaper, says, has Osama Bin Laden been dead for seven years and are U.S.
[03:43:47.014 --> 03:43:49.375]  and Britain covering it up to continue the war on terror?
[03:43:49.375 --> 03:43:52.236]  I mean, even mainstream news is talking like us now.
[03:43:52.236 --> 03:43:57.239]  And the Intel Center, known CIA run, is uploading new ones.
[03:43:57.239 --> 03:43:58.700]  I mean, there's just no end to it.
[03:43:58.700 --> 03:44:01.882]  Well, they're going to keep using them until... I mean, I think even if we had
[03:44:02.904 --> 03:44:04.365]  Physical proof that he was dead.
[03:44:04.365 --> 03:44:06.265]  They'd say, oh, that's just a fake imposter.
[03:44:06.265 --> 03:44:08.406]  The real Bin Laden's making tapes and sending them in.
[03:44:08.406 --> 03:44:13.128]  I don't think they'll ever... Will our great-grandchildren on the Mars base... Be scared of Osama Bin Laden?
[03:44:13.128 --> 03:44:14.028]  It'll be like the boogeyman.
[03:44:14.028 --> 03:44:17.010]  Look out, Bin Laden's under your bed and people will believe it.
[03:44:17.010 --> 03:44:21.351]  He was seen, a man with a turban was seen on the Mars base.
[03:44:21.351 --> 03:44:22.612]  We gotta take the shots, you know.
[03:44:25.465 --> 03:44:26.426]  But we're not going to Mars.
[03:44:26.426 --> 03:44:30.888]  We're just going to die right here with a eugenicist running around in an orgy of death and killing.
[03:44:30.888 --> 03:44:31.989]  Yeah, it's a shame.
[03:44:31.989 --> 03:44:35.771]  Because Mars probably, well I hear it has a blue sunset anyway.
[03:44:35.771 --> 03:44:38.572]  Hit your ass to Mars!
[03:44:38.572 --> 03:44:39.373]  Alright, that's all I have.
[03:44:39.373 --> 03:44:41.474]  Alright, thank you so much for popping in with us there.
[03:44:42.898 --> 03:44:46.759]  By the way, John, just while I'm on here, will you run and get Ted?
[03:44:46.759 --> 03:44:52.261]  I want a two-minute report at the end of the show from him on the latest on the economy, but I want to go to calls right now.
[03:44:52.261 --> 03:44:53.341]  Chris in Maryland.
[03:44:53.341 --> 03:44:54.221]  Chris, you're on the air.
[03:44:54.221 --> 03:44:54.661]  Go ahead.
[03:44:54.661 --> 03:44:57.942]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:44:57.942 --> 03:44:59.523]  I'm doing all right, brother.
[03:44:59.523 --> 03:45:10.226]  Okay, hey, I don't know if it was from you or if it was from me, because I sent you an article from Forbes.com that said that the dollar had actually collapsed, stating that gold was selling at $1,000 an ounce.
[03:45:11.636 --> 03:45:25.516]  But I also sent you an article about how an executive for CNN as far back as 1999 admitted to having military psyops as interns at CNN, and I sent it to you.
[03:45:26.069 --> 03:45:27.690]  You know, that was the Washington Post.
[03:45:27.690 --> 03:45:29.831]  It's all Pentagon-run.
[03:45:29.831 --> 03:45:31.932]  Fox is meant to be cartoonish and silly.
[03:45:31.932 --> 03:45:34.394]  CNN's the global arm of U.S.
[03:45:34.394 --> 03:45:43.959]  media, and it's completely... Gore Vidal admitted he was there for 9-11, and there were full-bird colonels and generals telling the producers what to do.
[03:45:43.959 --> 03:45:46.741]  And, no, I mean, I have the Army follows me.
[03:45:46.741 --> 03:45:47.722]  They follow Ron Paul.
[03:45:48.922 --> 03:45:50.123]  Yeah, there's Forbes.
[03:45:50.123 --> 03:45:56.007]  It's the dollars coming collapse is the headline.
[03:45:56.007 --> 03:46:00.591]  Inflation fears have many predicting a large dollar drop.
[03:46:00.591 --> 03:46:06.275]  One federalized portfolio manager is prepared.
[03:46:06.275 --> 03:46:10.058]  And so, yes, Chris, very, very serious times we're in.
[03:46:10.058 --> 03:46:10.919]  Alex?
[03:46:10.919 --> 03:46:12.080]  Yes.
[03:46:12.080 --> 03:46:12.680]  One last thing.
[03:46:12.680 --> 03:46:18.685]  I was talking to my dad about this because I turned him on to your show and now he loves your show like better than anything else.
[03:46:19.574 --> 03:46:22.495]  Um, I was downtown in Washington, D.C.
[03:46:22.495 --> 03:46:28.837]  over the weekend during that protest, and I was shouting out to people to check your website out.
[03:46:28.837 --> 03:46:36.780]  Infowars.com, check out the Obama deception film you put out, the Endgame, the global enslavement, all of your films.
[03:46:36.780 --> 03:46:42.222]  So if you get hits on your website more than ever, hopefully it's from some of these protesters.
[03:46:42.222 --> 03:46:43.283]  No, I know that...
[03:46:44.629 --> 03:46:47.732]  I heard there were Tierney Response Team shirts there with Info Wars.
[03:46:47.732 --> 03:46:50.234]  I heard there were a lot of our Obama New World Order signs there.
[03:46:50.234 --> 03:46:51.595]  Did you see any of those?
[03:46:51.595 --> 03:46:53.677]  Yes, I saw a lot of them.
[03:46:53.677 --> 03:47:05.867]  And people, they were on the scale from, you know, one guy at a sign that said, with a man's butt saying, butt out of my healthcare, to Impeach Obama, and basically
[03:47:06.523 --> 03:47:07.603]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[03:47:07.603 --> 03:47:09.324]  I have a couple criticisms for you if you can
[03:47:28.604 --> 03:47:29.244]  If you're open to that.
[03:47:29.244 --> 03:47:33.405]  Yeah, yeah, I'm ready for your criticisms, but what are we going to do about the New World Order?
[03:47:33.405 --> 03:47:35.045]  I'm not the one taxing you.
[03:47:35.045 --> 03:47:37.386]  I'm not the one putting fluoride in your water.
[03:47:37.386 --> 03:47:39.486]  I'm not the one bringing in world government.
[03:47:39.486 --> 03:47:44.347]  I know everybody spends about half their time about me, and overall that's actually good for us.
[03:47:44.347 --> 03:47:45.507]  It gets us more listeners.
[03:47:45.507 --> 03:47:47.027]  But I don't care about me.
[03:47:47.027 --> 03:47:48.607]  I'm sick of it being about me.
[03:47:48.607 --> 03:47:50.688]  But go ahead.
[03:47:50.688 --> 03:47:57.349]  Well, you talk a lot about the gold solution and getting back to the gold standard.
[03:47:58.015 --> 03:48:01.536]  And I just wanted to debate that on us.
[03:48:01.536 --> 03:48:03.356]  No, I really don't do that.
[03:48:03.356 --> 03:48:11.419]  I say we need to get off the private fellow reserve system and we should debate a gold back or a partially gold back or a fiat system.
[03:48:11.419 --> 03:48:17.280]  And I've had people on both sides of that, Ron Paul included.
[03:48:17.280 --> 03:48:20.021]  So misrepresentation, straw man again.
[03:48:21.483 --> 03:48:50.113]  What I would suggest is something a little different, which hasn't really been tried out, but it has to do with the idea that we have a common credit system that's not controlled by the central banking system like the credit system currently is, but that, kind of like an eBay feedback system for people individually, where you'll have credit based on your own issuance of your own promissory notes, which is what we're doing right now,
[03:48:50.560 --> 03:49:06.325]  But we need the ability to expand the credit and contract it to be able to create the goods in the economy and the services, which is one of the benefits of having the system that we have right now with commercial credit.
[03:49:06.325 --> 03:49:06.725]  I hear you.
[03:49:06.725 --> 03:49:11.466]  Why don't you write up the idea and send it to writers and infowars.com.
[03:49:11.466 --> 03:49:14.527]  I'm just tired of straw man attacks.
[03:49:14.527 --> 03:49:19.749]  99% of the time when I see something on the internet about me, it's something I've not said or not done or it's distorted.
[03:49:21.224 --> 03:49:36.397]  I had the writer and editor and voiceover person for the Money Masters on over and over again that has a fiat money solution fix.
[03:49:36.397 --> 03:49:44.284]  I've had Cook, let's get Cook back on, the economist, who writes for Global Research, who wants a fiat system.
[03:49:44.284 --> 03:49:44.764]  I've had
[03:49:46.843 --> 03:49:51.567]  Walter Burian and others on about the fiat system solution.
[03:49:51.567 --> 03:49:54.310]  And then I've had Ron Paul on who has his system.
[03:49:54.310 --> 03:50:06.461]  Man, I'm so, you know, I resented for you that it's a religion, an entire cottage industry of distorting what I say and what I stand for.
[03:50:09.230 --> 03:50:18.157]  And it's just very, I mean it's hard to take you seriously with your monetary plan when you say you disagree with me on something I haven't even said.
[03:50:18.157 --> 03:50:24.862]  Yes, the gold standard, we can't go back to it because the central banks know it's real money and they've hoarded the hell out of it.
[03:50:24.862 --> 03:50:31.668]  And so then you would be right back to square one with them fractionally reserved, loaning stuff out on that.
[03:50:31.668 --> 03:50:33.669]  I understand that.
[03:50:33.669 --> 03:50:34.370]  I understand that.
[03:50:35.347 --> 03:50:39.389]  But if we'd have stayed on that system, it would have been a hell of a lot better than what we've got now.
[03:50:39.389 --> 03:50:45.552]  So, let's just not have the bankers take over right now, completely, over the whole economy.
[03:50:45.552 --> 03:50:54.116]  And then after we have indicted them, and arrested them, and brought them to justice, then we can have a national debate about what we want.
[03:50:54.116 --> 03:50:56.097]  But it isn't about Alex Jones.
[03:50:56.097 --> 03:50:59.959]  I mean, the ship's sinking here, and I'm getting bitched at, trying to lower lifeboats over.
[03:51:01.820 --> 03:51:02.561]  Hello, friends.
[03:51:02.561 --> 03:51:05.703]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[03:51:05.703 --> 03:51:15.871]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[03:52:02.535 --> 03:52:08.581]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.581 --> 03:52:14.467]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.467 --> 03:52:20.614]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.934 --> 03:52:22.915]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.915 --> 03:52:25.377]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.377 --> 03:52:38.566]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.566 --> 03:52:40.247]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.247 --> 03:52:42.109]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:42.109 --> 03:52:48.333]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:52:57.265 --> 03:52:58.845]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.845 --> 03:53:01.526]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.526 --> 03:53:06.107]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:53:06.107 --> 03:53:08.668]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:53:08.668 --> 03:53:18.131]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:53:18.131 --> 03:53:18.631]  We're good to go.
[03:53:36.920 --> 03:53:37.640]  I think so.
[03:54:13.324 --> 03:54:21.046]  Final segment, I wanted to get some financial news from Ted Anderson.
[03:54:21.046 --> 03:54:23.687]  But crank that song back up.
[03:54:23.687 --> 03:54:24.927]  Gotta hear that one part.
[03:54:24.927 --> 03:54:27.868]  And there's beer in Texarkana.
[03:54:27.868 --> 03:54:28.209]  Alright.
[03:54:39.932 --> 03:54:46.753]  But the rebroadcast was jam-packed with key info, so the retransmission starts in a few minutes at InfoWars.com.
[03:54:46.753 --> 03:54:56.015]  I wanted to get Ted on briefly, because yeah, Forbes, AP, Reuters, every day I see a whole bunch of articles saying that the dollar's dead.
[03:54:56.015 --> 03:55:04.936]  Now, they may just be hyping that to drive things down again, to fearmonger people into the bank of the world taking over, then they'll jack it back up again.
[03:55:04.936 --> 03:55:09.137]  But the dollar's days are numbered in this incarnation.
[03:55:10.336 --> 03:55:15.798]  They're bringing in a world currency that's probably going to be somewhat dollar-backed, but a basket.
[03:55:15.798 --> 03:55:32.065]  Regardless, when you get $23.7 trillion, over $50 trillion globally, stolen from nations by the private banking families, now coming back in the market to buy stocks, to buy real estate, to buy infrastructure, to buy media, and to buy commodities, you're going to see inflation.
[03:55:32.065 --> 03:55:33.485]  And all the commodities are going up.
[03:55:33.485 --> 03:55:35.706]  Look at gold, right at $1,000.
[03:55:35.706 --> 03:55:39.848]  Ted Anderson, I heard there were some defaults, too, by gold companies.
[03:55:40.287 --> 03:55:42.248]  Yeah, American Barrack had to pull out.
[03:55:42.248 --> 03:55:46.510]  They've been hedging their position that they have in the ground.
[03:55:46.510 --> 03:55:52.393]  They've been selling short to sell forward their position that they haven't even pulled out of the ground yet.
[03:55:52.393 --> 03:55:57.896]  They don't have enough gold in production to support those short contracts.
[03:55:57.896 --> 03:56:02.698]  So last Friday, American Barrack defaulted on some and they're doing what they can to settle up with others.
[03:56:03.558 --> 03:56:07.119]  It's not a very bright scene, but that's the hedging game.
[03:56:07.119 --> 03:56:12.920]  So all the squirreliness to manipulate and keep gold prices down isn't working.
[03:56:12.920 --> 03:56:19.621]  Briefly, Ted, tell folks about the coin offers you've got left at that $9.44 level with gold at $1,000.
[03:56:19.621 --> 03:56:22.321]  Gigantic discount, but this is the end.
[03:56:22.321 --> 03:56:23.982]  You've sold off of most of it.
[03:56:23.982 --> 03:56:25.322]  Yeah, this is the end, my friend.
[03:56:25.322 --> 03:56:27.863]  The $10 Liberty right now at $8.18.50 is the same price as it was
[03:56:30.759 --> 03:56:30.959]  I think?
[03:56:47.080 --> 03:56:49.681]  Sorry, Ted, forgot to hit my cough button there.
[03:57:07.455 --> 03:57:08.576]  No, that's okay.
[03:57:08.576 --> 03:57:20.345]  I mean, just Alex, right now the market is just so hot and it's reminding me of a year and a half ago when even bags of junk silver became unavailable.
[03:57:20.345 --> 03:57:21.566]  Krugerrands, you couldn't get them.
[03:57:21.566 --> 03:57:22.787]  Maple Leafs, you couldn't get them.
[03:57:22.807 --> 03:57:26.150]  We've got gold and silver at the lowest price people are going to find anywhere.
[03:57:26.150 --> 03:57:27.370]  It's almost running out.
[03:57:27.370 --> 03:57:30.793]  You're having trouble getting more supplies even at the higher number.
[03:57:30.793 --> 03:57:32.514]  Folks need to move on this now.
[03:57:32.514 --> 03:57:38.019]  The brokers will be there at Genesis at Midas Resources until midnight tonight Central 1-800-686-2237 800.
[03:57:42.762 --> 03:57:45.103]  So you've got the Franks and the Sovereigns.
[03:57:45.103 --> 03:57:46.284]  What else do you have in silver, Ted?
[03:57:46.284 --> 03:57:48.525]  Franks, Sovereigns, Walking Liberty halves into silver.
[03:57:48.525 --> 03:57:49.686]  I would suggest those hands down.
[03:57:49.686 --> 03:57:52.128]  Although that Lakota coin is going to be pushing up again.
[03:57:52.128 --> 03:57:52.968]  They're at $22.30.
[03:57:52.968 --> 03:57:54.269]  There's a good variety of things.
[03:57:54.269 --> 03:57:55.390]  What's your half dollar at?
[03:58:09.898 --> 03:58:11.879]  Like half dollars at $8.69, you can't beat that.
[03:58:11.879 --> 03:58:12.820]  That's below spot.
[03:58:12.820 --> 03:58:14.681]  That's below spot.
[03:58:14.681 --> 03:58:16.662]  I know I do.
[03:58:16.662 --> 03:58:16.842]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:16.842 --> 03:58:21.004]  Ted Anderson standing by to take your call or answer your questions.
[03:58:21.004 --> 03:58:22.164]  One coin, a hundred coins.
[03:58:22.164 --> 03:58:23.505]  They're happy to talk to you.
[03:58:23.505 --> 03:58:24.886]  No pressure.
[03:58:24.886 --> 03:58:26.787]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:26.787 --> 03:58:28.367]  Thank you so much for the report, Ted.
[03:58:28.367 --> 03:58:28.928]  Yeah, you bet, Alex.
[03:58:29.708 --> 03:58:31.469]  Great job crew today.
[03:58:31.469 --> 03:58:36.792]  Out of the park for Jaron, Hartman, Bill, Matt, everybody.
[03:58:36.792 --> 03:58:37.452]  God bless you.
[03:58:37.452 --> 03:58:38.893]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:38.893 --> 03:58:43.075]  Spread the word about the show as we fight the globalists.
[03:58:43.075 --> 03:58:44.476]  You are listening to GCN.

[03:58:51.408 --> 03:58:55.652]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:58:55.652 --> 03:58:57.654]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:58:57.654 --> 03:59:06.183]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:59:06.183 --> 03:59:11.728]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:59:11.728 --> 03:59:13.350]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:59:13.570 --> 03:59:20.091]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:59:20.091 --> 03:59:31.154]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:59:31.154 --> 03:59:31.914]  That's right.
[03:59:31.914 --> 03:59:34.474]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:59:34.474 --> 03:59:36.075]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
