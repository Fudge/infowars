[00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:49.302]  A new poll finds Americans support fundamental changes in a health care system and the creation of a government-run insurance plan to compete with private insurers.
[00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:56.324]  Respondents believe Uncle Sam could do a better job of holding down health care costs than a private sector driven by profit incentives.

[00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:03.485]  Americans want health care reform.
[00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:10.309]  But they want the right health care reform, and that means taking the time and the care necessary to get it right.
[00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.131]  Against Republican advice, they rush the stimulus.
[00:01:14.912 --> 00:01:19.735]  We shouldn't rush again on something as important and costly as health care.

[00:04:09.037 --> 00:04:11.279]  Fathers are our first teachers and coaches.
[00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:12.660]  They're our mentors.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:13.881]  They're our role models.
[00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:17.043]  They set an example of success and they push us to succeed.
[00:04:17.243 --> 00:04:18.664]  Encourage us when we're struggling.
[00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:22.607]  They love us even when we disappoint them and they stand by us when nobody else will.
[00:04:22.927 --> 00:04:29.952]  President also urged Americans to express their gratitude to all the fathers who serve today in the United States military.

[00:05:10.922 --> 00:05:15.305]  And say they still love each other just as much today as when they first met.
[00:05:15.645 --> 00:05:19.808]  By the way, they met at a dancing school and they worked in a vaudeville act.

[00:07:16.977 --> 00:07:20.499]  Very important radio transmission lined up for you today.
[00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:21.279]  We are live.
[00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:24.221]  It is Sunday, the 21st day of June 2009.
[00:07:24.481 --> 00:07:34.066]  Coming up in about an hour and a half, NewsRadio 590 KLBJ reporter is going to pop in for about five minutes, Sarah Hudeberg.
[00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:43.791]  I heard her going over the news just before we went live and she was pointing out the fact that the state of Texas, the Cattlemen's Association and others
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.702]  Are saying, hey, we don't want this Clean Water Restoration Act.
[00:07:48.002 --> 00:07:53.145]  This will federalize all water, including rainwater, wells, aquifers.
[00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:59.129]  They are going to grab the entire supply, lakes, basically federal police everywhere.
[00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:00.890]  This is happening nationwide.
[00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.173]  And I covered this two weeks ago on the air, a week ago, and I get emails saying I'm a liar.
[00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:09.575]  But now here it is with state officials and cattlemen and other
[00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:10.689]  I don't know.
[00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:34.690]  Okay, we have a very important show lined up.
[00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:41.373]  Outside of those important issues, I'm going to be breaking down what's really happening with North Korea, what's really happening with Iran.
[00:08:41.794 --> 00:08:44.275]  Why is this suddenly happening all over the globe?
[00:08:44.835 --> 00:08:49.337]  Why are police in Peru machine-gunning hundreds of people?
[00:08:49.717 --> 00:08:51.278]  Why is it happening in Iran?
[00:08:51.338 --> 00:08:53.539]  Why suddenly is there war in Pakistan?
[00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:55.380]  Why suddenly is a U.S.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.063]  ship in a standoff with an Iranian government-flagged vessel that they say has weapons on it?
[00:09:01.523 --> 00:09:04.685]  Why is North Korea saying they may go ahead and launch nuclear weapons?
[00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:07.567]  Why is this all just suddenly happening?
[00:09:09.368 --> 00:09:11.570]  We'll be breaking that down later in the show.
[00:09:14.511 --> 00:09:18.914]  But first off, in the stack of news in front of me, I have three stories.
[00:09:21.056 --> 00:09:22.417]  Some of these I covered this week.
[00:09:22.657 --> 00:09:24.538]  One of them is brand new today.
[00:09:25.282 --> 00:09:28.883]  Exclusive to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:09:29.343 --> 00:09:34.065]  And you will hear about this later in mainstream media, but with their spin on it.
[00:09:35.526 --> 00:09:38.307]  We can't really say you do hear a lot of it here first.
[00:09:38.347 --> 00:09:42.048]  We really do the great research and our listeners send us the best tips.
[00:09:42.588 --> 00:09:47.290]  It was listeners found that bill to literally seize all the water supplies under federal control.
[00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.651]  And remember the feds themselves are now controlled by offshore private banks.
[00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:53.392]  And a separate issue
[00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:04.525]  Since Monday, when they finally released the Federal Reserve Reform Bill, it is a total private Federal Reserve takeover of even the federal government.
[00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:06.388]  No Bill of Rights, no Constitution.
[00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:08.071]  Dwarfs the Patriot Act.
[00:10:09.145 --> 00:10:15.710]  Dwarfs Military Commissions Act, dwarfs even what Hitler and Stalin and Mao put on paper for their illegitimate powers.
[00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:28.158]  This is just, we are God, we own and rule everything from a restaurant, a hot dog shack, up to the car dealerships and the car manufacturers and the steel producers.
[00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:30.780]  Everything, anything dealing with the economy.
[00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:36.444]  No judge, no jury, no due process, no nothing.
[00:10:37.085 --> 00:10:41.008]  We started beating the drum Monday, begging listeners to force this out in the mainstream news.
[00:10:41.148 --> 00:10:43.050]  It is now mainstream news.
[00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:46.673]  Because this wasn't even going to be discussed.
[00:10:46.693 --> 00:10:50.096]  There wasn't even going to be a debate about the end of the republic.
[00:10:50.176 --> 00:10:53.738]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's actually all happening right now.
[00:10:54.159 --> 00:11:03.146]  As Lenin said, the evil genius that he was, there are times in history when more happens in a week or a month or a year than happened in the previous hundred years.
[00:11:04.587 --> 00:11:06.729]  Now, here's the first big top stories today.
[00:11:07.714 --> 00:11:28.588]  Remember, we broke the Homeland Security reports, the DHS report that made national news three months ago, saying all gun owners are the number one threat to the government and that Homeland Security is set up to take on gun owners and veterans, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, Bob Barr supporters, anyone who wants to control the borders.
[00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:29.789]  We broke that.
[00:11:29.849 --> 00:11:31.270]  People didn't believe it was real.
[00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.412]  Ron Paul's office found out it was real, said, yes, it's real.
[00:11:35.372 --> 00:11:37.574]  And it made national news and the media spun it.
[00:11:38.536 --> 00:11:46.704]  And we broke the MIAC report out of Missouri, and we literally, I'd say, more than half the big news now that fights the New World Order is coming out of me.
[00:11:47.044 --> 00:11:50.788]  Coming out of my small office, my ragtag team, and it really freaks me out.
[00:11:52.229 --> 00:11:55.272]  Because it's a dangerous position to be in, and I'm not even that good.
[00:11:55.892 --> 00:11:57.454]  And I can't believe I'm in this position.
[00:11:59.096 --> 00:12:00.097]  But I'll tell you why it is.
[00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:02.138]  It's just because I read the email from our listeners.
[00:12:02.318 --> 00:12:05.059]  It's you scouring the bills, the legislation.
[00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:06.320]  It's you and the state police.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.821]  It's you and the FBI that send me these documents.
[00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:10.302]  It's the whistleblowers.
[00:12:10.382 --> 00:12:19.126]  It's the preachers that sent me the reports that they were secretly being trained by FEMA to tell their flocks to hand in their guns, to go to FEMA camps and take forced inoculations when the time came.
[00:12:19.666 --> 00:12:21.947]  I got made fun of even though I gave you the secret documents.
[00:12:21.987 --> 00:12:23.068]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:12:25.555 --> 00:12:30.647]  And I don't understand why we continue to break literally hundreds and hundreds of the major important stories.
[00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.015]  And now I'm being attacked by international media.
[00:12:34.747 --> 00:12:37.929]  I mean, we're here on the front lines getting battered to hell, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.533]  And we know most of you are supporting us, but people need to take serious the time we've got left on air.
[00:12:43.814 --> 00:12:47.036]  The time we've got left with Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:47.356 --> 00:12:50.739]  Do not take any of this for granted with the information I'm about to give you.
[00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:57.604]  A lot of people have died and been imprisoned and have lost their jobs to bring you the information you're about to get.
[00:12:57.624 --> 00:12:58.464]  Do you understand that?
[00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:00.446]  Do you understand that?
[00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:02.147]  This isn't a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:02.659 --> 00:13:04.140]  People ask, how can I still be alive?
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.662]  How can I be on AM and FM stations across the country?
[00:13:06.882 --> 00:13:08.983]  Because the globalists don't have total control.
[00:13:09.204 --> 00:13:16.529]  They're able to steer society, they're able to twist society, they're able to dominate, but not fully micromanage and control yet.
[00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:18.290]  That's now happening.
[00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.391]  The iron curtain is lowering.
[00:13:21.792 --> 00:13:23.193]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:23.834 --> 00:13:27.016]  And even if you don't believe me intellectually, in your gut you know things are bad.
[00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:29.658]  You know we predicted all of this with precision.
[00:13:31.573 --> 00:13:33.353]  Now, this broke earlier in the week.
[00:13:33.573 --> 00:13:40.315]  People didn't believe us, and then the ACLU came out, found out about it, and started suing a day later.
[00:13:41.015 --> 00:13:45.056]  And it's now been on CNN, but CNN acts like, well, I guess it's reasonable.
[00:13:45.876 --> 00:13:49.177]  See, they'll take incredible stuff we report and then make it like it's no big deal.
[00:13:51.177 --> 00:13:55.438]  Like, oh yes, it is good to say veterans are the number one terror threat, and Homeland Security's for them.
[00:13:55.718 --> 00:13:59.359]  And they have the head of Veterans Affairs come out and say, well, veterans are terrorists,
[00:14:01.212 --> 00:14:07.395]  And now they're having the VFWs go back and have to basically register and get ready to turn in even their Civil War cannons.
[00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:09.556]  I mean, this is all happening, folks.
[00:14:10.036 --> 00:14:10.557]  Listen to this.
[00:14:10.637 --> 00:14:17.660]  DOD training manual, not even classified, describes protest as terrorism.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.762]  All protest is illegal and is an act of terrorism.
[00:14:21.822 --> 00:14:23.243]  Protesting anything.
[00:14:23.983 --> 00:14:25.784]  A toxic waste dump in your neighborhood.
[00:14:27.974 --> 00:14:32.396]  Illegal aliens being above the law, not being arrested by local police, but citizens have the book thrown at them.
[00:14:34.516 --> 00:14:35.197]  The war.
[00:14:36.457 --> 00:14:37.677]  Attacks on the Second Amendment.
[00:14:39.118 --> 00:14:44.279]  Current Department of Defense anti-terrorism training course material states that the existence of First Amendment rights in the U.S.
[00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:47.720]  Constitution constitutes terrorist activity.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.601]  The ACLU has written the DOD, regardless.
[00:14:50.316 --> 00:14:59.465]  Regarding its anti-terrorism and force protection annual rehearser training course, which advises personnel that political protest amounts to low-level terrorism.
[00:14:59.505 --> 00:15:01.306]  And it goes on, I'm going to read that later.
[00:15:01.326 --> 00:15:02.327]  Now this isn't the new story.
[00:15:02.367 --> 00:15:03.549]  I've been reporting this all week.
[00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.451]  Now I'll confirm to be real.
[00:15:06.892 --> 00:15:08.193]  Look, we don't make any of this up.
[00:15:08.253 --> 00:15:10.695]  I know we break it, break it, break it, break it, break it.
[00:15:10.735 --> 00:15:12.257]  People can't believe we break all this.
[00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.911]  Because we know what news is, folks.
[00:15:16.951 --> 00:15:17.971]  We go through our tips.
[00:15:18.011 --> 00:15:20.353]  We go through the stuff that millions of listeners feed us.
[00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:23.514]  And people now know we're the place to send the documents.
[00:15:23.794 --> 00:15:25.635]  We're the place to send the leads.
[00:15:26.436 --> 00:15:27.796]  Most of it declassified.
[00:15:27.856 --> 00:15:31.398]  Just publicly training the military that there's no more First Amendment in America.
[00:15:31.558 --> 00:15:32.319]  Now, listen to this.
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.861]  I told you about this.
[00:15:35.921 --> 00:15:39.182]  This is in the Obama deception release three months ago.
[00:15:39.562 --> 00:15:40.463]  Done four months ago.
[00:15:42.031 --> 00:15:44.552]  This is in the Obama deception.
[00:15:45.012 --> 00:15:47.253]  I talk about this every week on the show.
[00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:52.055]  It is now in the New York Times, so now it's real, so now we can talk about it.
[00:15:53.735 --> 00:15:56.056]  This is the New York Times, Friday.
[00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:00.478]  Our story about it has a link to it.
[00:16:00.518 --> 00:16:05.740]  Proposed law allows AG, Attorney General, Holder, to block gun sales to over a million Americans.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.441]  The bill is no fly, no buy.
[00:16:10.814 --> 00:16:16.458]  No judge, no jury, a million, 100,000 plus, now it's a million, 200,000, a million, 200,000.
[00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:19.560]  It grows by 25,000 every month.
[00:16:20.221 --> 00:16:21.682]  And then that's not even the big news.
[00:16:21.862 --> 00:16:23.003]  That's not even the big news.
[00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:27.186]  When I get back, I'm gonna give you the big one.
[00:16:27.646 --> 00:16:28.047]  Stay with us.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.583]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[00:16:35.883 --> 00:16:42.733]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.

[00:17:34.434 --> 00:17:36.395]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources.

[00:17:40.537 --> 00:17:42.198]  And let's take in a brief mind movie.
[00:17:42.678 --> 00:17:48.141]  We're surrounded by jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[00:17:48.361 --> 00:17:53.944]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[00:17:54.164 --> 00:17:55.804]  The stimulus package is working.
[00:17:56.165 --> 00:17:57.685]  A bailout is coming your way.
[00:17:58.046 --> 00:18:01.967]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:02.568]  Pardon me?
[00:18:03.388 --> 00:18:04.369]  Back to the real world.
[00:18:04.629 --> 00:18:08.591]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[00:18:08.891 --> 00:18:10.912]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[00:18:11.452 --> 00:18:12.933]  No one else is coming to the rescue.

[00:18:34.093 --> 00:18:45.603]  Today, we cannot afford to ignore the current state of our country, the economy, job layoffs, mass foreclosures, and now we are all at risk of being exposed to this new flu pandemic.
[00:18:45.823 --> 00:18:50.407]  The Center for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency across the United States.
[00:18:50.647 --> 00:18:52.108]  What can you do to prepare yourself?

[00:19:33.683 --> 00:19:36.165]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[00:19:36.465 --> 00:19:37.425]  I've been so sick.
[00:19:37.726 --> 00:19:39.106]  Will a life change tea help me?
[00:19:39.407 --> 00:19:40.827]  Our answer is always the same.
[00:19:41.268 --> 00:19:46.931]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are attacking you this very moment.

[00:19:53.255 --> 00:19:57.497]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[00:19:57.758 --> 00:19:58.738]  We use results.
[00:19:59.178 --> 00:20:03.641]  LifeChangeT's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[00:20:03.941 --> 00:20:08.263]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[00:20:08.543 --> 00:20:12.005]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[00:20:12.425 --> 00:20:15.887]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[00:20:16.308 --> 00:20:16.908]  Our number is 928-308-0408.
[00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.432]  Again, that's 928-308-0408.

[00:20:28.013 --> 00:20:30.354]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[00:20:30.555 --> 00:20:33.196]  And remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[00:20:34.296 --> 00:20:37.398]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:20:37.978 --> 00:20:38.959]  Search no more.
[00:20:39.479 --> 00:20:42.540]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:45.041 --> 00:20:50.224]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I get up here on the radio and I tell you
[00:20:53.582 --> 00:20:56.406]  That they are training NORTHCOM to confiscate your guns.
[00:20:56.466 --> 00:21:00.210]  It's because I knew they'd set up NORTHCOM in the late 1990s.
[00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.112]  They didn't set up NORTHCOM in 2002.
[00:21:03.234 --> 00:21:06.377]  Bill Clinton was giving speeches to NORTHCOM in 1993.
[00:21:06.998 --> 00:21:12.665]  It is the military jurisdiction over the United States controlling the American people.
[00:21:13.922 --> 00:21:26.970]  And now the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 states their job is to take on the American people and the governors and the states and now the feds are openly announcing they're federalizing all the water and are basically take people's property if they want it.
[00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:41.398]  So everywhere in the East and the South that isn't under federal control like they are in the West we now are going to be because they're announcing a buffer zone of three times the size of the waterway on either side
[00:21:43.188 --> 00:21:43.668]  We're good to go.
[00:22:06.004 --> 00:22:13.586]  In the Obama deception, I explain, after they bankrupt us and steal tens of trillions, they will then set up a new bank of the world that will pay our carbon taxes to and that will then regulate us.
[00:22:13.846 --> 00:22:14.386]  How do I know?
[00:22:14.426 --> 00:22:15.567]  I'm reading their official documents.
[00:22:15.967 --> 00:22:18.447]  Now it's been announced, but it's worse than I thought.
[00:22:19.007 --> 00:22:20.008]  Worse than I thought.
[00:22:20.868 --> 00:22:28.070]  They're bypassing even the illusion of freedom and signing deals with this private offshore bank in treaties.
[00:22:28.803 --> 00:22:36.425]  They're going to have the private Federal Reserve, it's regional governorship, it's holding company, openly be above all laws and do whatever it wants.
[00:22:36.485 --> 00:22:42.746]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, you think they've stolen $14.8 trillion, more than the GDP in eight months, seven months?
[00:22:43.907 --> 00:22:46.347]  This is worse than I even thought.
[00:22:46.787 --> 00:22:48.348]  I am shaking right now.
[00:22:49.328 --> 00:22:51.548]  They are definitely going for absolute broke.
[00:22:51.749 --> 00:22:52.449]  This is it.
[00:22:52.589 --> 00:22:54.769]  This is the total, complete takeover.
[00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:57.590]  They're going to stage massive terror attacks, but I'll tell you this,
[00:22:58.891 --> 00:23:00.692]  The good news is the people are waking up.
[00:23:01.512 --> 00:23:03.513]  I'm in here getting ready to do the Sunday Syndicated Show.
[00:23:03.713 --> 00:23:04.693]  It's really growing, by the way.
[00:23:05.213 --> 00:23:07.154]  And I'm listening to Dr. Dina Dell, who I've interviewed before.
[00:23:07.494 --> 00:23:09.355]  He's a different cat when he's on your show.
[00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:11.036]  And he knows who I am.
[00:23:12.636 --> 00:23:20.859]  And a caller calls and he goes, yeah, I heard David Rockefeller wants to reduce world population and the government dug up a dead whaler to get the old 1918 Spanish flu that killed 40 million people.
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.721]  He said it's conspiracy theory, isn't real, you couldn't hide something like that.
[00:23:26.061 --> 00:23:27.422]  That's been in the Journal of Science.
[00:23:28.021 --> 00:23:35.044]  London Guardian, ABC News reported two weeks ago, world's rich meet in secret meeting to call for population reduction.
[00:23:35.544 --> 00:23:48.610]  I mean, in fact, Paul Hartman, right now, just Google rich, the exact headline from the Guardian, that was a really in-depth one, was world's richest meet to discuss population reduction.
[00:23:50.131 --> 00:23:54.573]  Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Dean, I happen to have the actual articles with them saying it themselves.
[00:23:54.973 --> 00:23:56.154]  Oh, but it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.371]  Okay, well, proposed law allows A.G.
[00:23:59.431 --> 00:24:01.852]  Holder to block gun sales to over a million Americans.
[00:24:04.272 --> 00:24:06.333]  And I've been giving this bill number out for months and months.
[00:24:07.494 --> 00:24:12.815]  In fact, the Chief of Staff of the White House introduced this last year when he was still in the Congress, Rahm Emanuel.
[00:24:13.836 --> 00:24:15.456]  And I've given all those bill numbers on air.
[00:24:17.757 --> 00:24:19.658]  And the media is pushing it, saying it's a good thing.
[00:24:19.918 --> 00:24:22.079]  This is guilty until proven innocent.
[00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:26.120]  You have absolutely no rights, no liberties, no freedom.
[00:24:26.846 --> 00:24:28.267]  There's no way to get off the list.
[00:24:28.388 --> 00:24:44.103]  This is like wearing a yellow star in Nazi Germany, where you can't have businesses, can't buy, can't sell, and Homeland Security says, you're on that list, and the criminal list is over four million, under Patriot Act compliance for every car dealership, banks, car rentals, hotels, jobs, everything.
[00:24:45.284 --> 00:24:47.667]  When you have bad credit, you're going to be on the no-fly list.
[00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:49.479]  Anything.
[00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:51.180]  Somebody doesn't like you, you're gonna be on it.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.581]  It's a chilling effect.
[00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:57.183]  And the bill is called the No Fly No Buy.
[00:24:57.943 --> 00:25:00.304]  And they had 25,000 people a month to it.
[00:25:00.844 --> 00:25:02.125]  Three or four months ago, it was 1,100,000.
[00:25:02.165 --> 00:25:03.345]  That means it's over.
[00:25:03.385 --> 00:25:03.345]  1,200,000.
[00:25:03.445 --> 00:25:07.627]  Now that's mainstream news, New York Times, but they're saying it's a good idea.
[00:25:12.895 --> 00:25:16.278]  We're gonna have a new class of American where no judge, no jury, just on a list.
[00:25:16.658 --> 00:25:19.640]  And the feds come in and take your farm or ranch and say you can't use it.
[00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:22.862]  If rainwater hits it, that's what the bill says.
[00:25:23.523 --> 00:25:24.023]  Rainwater.
[00:25:24.404 --> 00:25:25.304]  And that's not even me!
[00:25:25.604 --> 00:25:31.869]  I'm listening to the local news people doing, covering that on record during the breaks.
[00:25:34.231 --> 00:25:39.655]  This is really all happening, ladies and gentlemen, and if that isn't enough for you, here's the newest one.
[00:25:42.503 --> 00:25:43.743]  This is the newest report.
[00:25:44.003 --> 00:25:46.604]  This is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonHunter.com.
[00:25:46.624 --> 00:25:47.564]  We are breaking this.
[00:25:48.064 --> 00:25:53.085]  Just like we broke the Homeland Security report and the MIAC report saying all veterans, all gun owners are the number one threat.
[00:25:53.326 --> 00:25:55.646]  Homeland Security North Com is designed for you.
[00:25:56.286 --> 00:25:59.927]  So that the criminal foreign banks can secure their takeover.
[00:25:59.967 --> 00:26:03.488]  They're here to babysit you with a baton and a machine gun upside the head.
[00:26:04.168 --> 00:26:06.749]  And to make sure this heist takes place properly.
[00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:07.929]  Of course the cops don't know that.
[00:26:10.427 --> 00:26:31.842]  Virginia State Police say anti-New World Order and gun rights activists are terrorists, and I've read this report, this was federally written, just like I told you the state police report in Missouri, the MIAC report was federally written, and that came out later, it was, because I've read the federal reports, but this says gun rights activists are terrorists, and tells the state police, go read it, to go ahead and take in for questioning.
[00:26:32.863 --> 00:26:36.706]  You see somebody with a get us out of the UN sticker, take them to jail.
[00:26:38.391 --> 00:26:41.894]  That's right, because the UN is the receivership body to take this country over.
[00:26:43.395 --> 00:26:47.739]  And cops, when you lose your pension fund and everything you got, just remember you helped the New World Order.
[00:26:47.979 --> 00:26:53.524]  And you pimp judges, and the sellout congressmen we've got, and the state senators, all of you.
[00:26:53.844 --> 00:26:57.127]  We are being absolutely usurped right now.
[00:26:59.849 --> 00:27:01.470]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is coming up.
[00:27:01.751 --> 00:27:05.574]  But again, DOD training manual describes all protest as terrorism.
[00:27:06.252 --> 00:27:12.075]  The actual training manual is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:27:12.475 --> 00:27:14.977]  And mainstream news is reporting it like it's normal.
[00:27:15.017 --> 00:27:16.637]  Oh no, yes, protesting is now terrorism.
[00:27:16.978 --> 00:27:19.419]  Ladies and gentlemen, this government is completely rogue.
[00:27:20.019 --> 00:27:21.980]  Let's go ahead and start playing Napolitano.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.442]  We'll play it when we come back.
[00:27:25.082 --> 00:27:29.024]  Because I want you to understand something.
[00:27:32.361 --> 00:27:36.423]  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday on the show, I got on the air, and this isn't about me getting credit.
[00:27:36.743 --> 00:27:37.964]  It's about you getting credit.
[00:27:38.684 --> 00:27:41.905]  And it's about showing people there's a chance to fight these monsters off.
[00:27:44.747 --> 00:27:46.087]  Listen to me very, very carefully.
[00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:58.973]  I went on air, and I said, you gotta break this story nationally, that they're secretly hired 20-plus thousand preachers to tell their flocks to turn their guns in to go to FEMA camps and render them to Caesar.
[00:27:59.313 --> 00:27:59.693]  Secretly!
[00:27:59.714 --> 00:28:00.714]  They're not supposed to tell the
[00:28:01.283 --> 00:28:04.784]  The practitioners, or the, uh, uh, the, the, the, is that the right word?
[00:28:04.844 --> 00:28:06.824]  The, the, uh, the parishioners.
[00:28:06.884 --> 00:28:07.604]  Not practitioners.
[00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:08.304]  The parishioners.
[00:28:08.685 --> 00:28:09.965]  You're not supposed to tell them.
[00:28:10.185 --> 00:28:12.005]  They're on secret government payroll.
[00:28:12.085 --> 00:28:17.446]  This is, the, the, Reuters is reporting the CIA is recruiting your local bankers to spy on you.
[00:28:17.666 --> 00:28:18.827]  That's completely illegal.
[00:28:19.427 --> 00:28:22.247]  They're running CIA ads on radio and TV everywhere.
[00:28:23.428 --> 00:28:25.588]  This is a total takeover of America.
[00:28:26.405 --> 00:28:29.047]  The Pentagon, the CIA, all work for offshore banks.
[00:28:29.087 --> 00:28:29.848]  It's a big joke.
[00:28:29.888 --> 00:28:30.889]  We're being hijacked.
[00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:32.430]  This is a corporate takeover.
[00:28:33.671 --> 00:28:34.852]  But this is what's positive.
[00:28:36.153 --> 00:28:47.502]  I got on the air and ranted and raved and beat my brains out and now finally a few mainstream outlets are reporting that it is a total Federal Reserve dictatorship and now we've got a chance to beat it.
[00:28:48.663 --> 00:28:55.969]  Because you spread the word and you took the articles that Paul Watson and Steve Watson wrote like Obama regulatory reform plan officially establishes
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.102]  Banking Dictatorship of the United States.
[00:28:59.283 --> 00:29:02.365]  Steve wrote this other article, Financial Dictatorship Spreads to Europe.
[00:29:02.606 --> 00:29:03.506]  The very same system.
[00:29:03.526 --> 00:29:04.607]  It's the same shareholders.
[00:29:04.948 --> 00:29:06.249]  Same system being set up there.
[00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:12.434]  They're now... You know, Napolitano's told me he listens to the show and so does his producer.
[00:29:12.535 --> 00:29:19.441]  And I'm honored that he basically, word for word, took what I said, did the research himself as a former federal judge, and did a report on Fox News.
[00:29:20.302 --> 00:29:21.743]  But that's coming up when we get back.
[00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:25.822]  But there's a wrinkle to it that will break down as well.
[00:29:25.882 --> 00:29:27.185]  But we've got to beat them.
[00:29:27.445 --> 00:29:31.715]  If we tell the public foreign banks are hijacking, we've got a chance to beat them.
[00:29:31.775 --> 00:29:32.256]  Stay with us.
[00:29:33.647 --> 00:29:39.149]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.330]  Think about that.
[00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:43.031]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:46.453]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[00:29:46.733 --> 00:29:56.517]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.

[00:30:02.802 --> 00:30:03.823]  The choice is yours.
[00:30:03.963 --> 00:30:09.248]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[00:30:09.588 --> 00:30:10.329]  Choose for Health.
[00:30:10.609 --> 00:30:14.392]  The world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[00:30:14.653 --> 00:30:17.115]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.

[00:30:34.605 --> 00:30:40.068]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:30:40.108 --> 00:30:40.628]  and the world.
[00:30:40.888 --> 00:30:44.350]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.

[00:30:51.254 --> 00:30:53.035]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:30:53.295 --> 00:31:01.219]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.

[00:31:36.189 --> 00:31:38.109]  Worried how you will provide for your family?
[00:31:38.289 --> 00:31:40.190]  Do you worry where your money will come from?

[00:32:33.116 --> 00:32:33.997]  Ah, springtime.
[00:32:34.418 --> 00:32:39.622]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[00:32:39.942 --> 00:32:44.407]  Well, the answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:32:44.567 --> 00:32:50.292]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[00:32:50.532 --> 00:32:58.839]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[00:32:59.159 --> 00:33:01.821]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:08.326]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons.
[00:33:08.607 --> 00:33:12.570]  So pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.

[00:33:25.615 --> 00:33:26.796]  You're listening to GCN.
[00:33:26.816 --> 00:33:28.457]  Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[00:33:45.469 --> 00:33:47.774]  Let's go!
[00:33:58.167 --> 00:34:00.248]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:34:00.308 --> 00:34:02.248]  Next hour, we'll have open phones.
[00:34:02.308 --> 00:34:10.431]  We've got Sarah Hudeberg, NewsRadio 590, Kelby Jay Reporter, coming in with some of the clips of state officials and the head of the Cattlemen's Association here in Texas.
[00:34:10.791 --> 00:34:19.373]  But it's all over the country talking about the feds to control all rainwater, all puddles, all ponds, come on your property, no warrants, regulations control.
[00:34:20.234 --> 00:34:22.574]  That all ties into just the total federal takeover.
[00:34:23.415 --> 00:34:26.336]  But first, before we go to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, introduce him.
[00:34:26.376 --> 00:34:27.616]  I wanted to have him hear this.
[00:34:28.137 --> 00:34:35.900]  Now again, we started covering this Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, then Ron Paul came in and said, yes, the bill does set up a financial dictatorship for the private Federal Reserve.
[00:34:36.961 --> 00:34:47.185]  Now Napolitano, I think in two minutes, really sums it up for people out there that aren't aware of this, because there's hardly any news coverage of the so-called Federal Reserve reform.
[00:34:47.225 --> 00:34:48.545]  I mean, there's lots of coverage of it.
[00:34:48.925 --> 00:34:52.387]  People are talking about it, but they're saying, we have to have it, or we're all dead.
[00:34:52.487 --> 00:34:54.708]  Give the bankers that caused the crisis more power.
[00:34:55.648 --> 00:34:57.889]  And then meanwhile, when you actually look at the bill,
[00:34:58.755 --> 00:35:01.196]  Well, I think Napolitano breaks it down, so here it is.
[00:35:02.997 --> 00:35:11.882]  I'm Judge Andrew Napolitano and the verdict is coming on President Barack Obama's historic plan to overhaul and regulate our financial institutions.
[00:35:12.322 --> 00:35:13.143]  Here's the question.
[00:35:13.583 --> 00:35:19.646]  What is left out of this proposal is, and what we deserve to know is, who will regulate the Federal Reserve?
[00:35:20.127 --> 00:35:26.250]  What will become of clauses in the Constitution that prohibit the very type of regulation the President wants?
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.962]  And what is now the meaning of the word free in free market?
[00:35:31.163 --> 00:35:33.084]  Here are the facts.
[00:35:33.144 --> 00:35:37.466]  The bias of the drafters of this proposal is that the government knows best.
[00:35:38.006 --> 00:35:47.552]  The Constitution should not be an obstacle to the egalitarian goals of the government and no private behavior is beyond the government's reach of its huge hand.
[00:35:48.132 --> 00:35:56.157]  The essence of the proposal is to give the Federal Reserve the authority to regulate any aspect of any firms that in its discretion
[00:35:56.696 --> 00:36:00.938]  Its sole discretion could adversely affect the economy if they fail.
[00:36:01.518 --> 00:36:07.220]  The Fed would thus be the only unregulated private entity on the planet.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:16.263]  This private, super-secret bank, half of whose board is appointed by the President, is the most secret aspect in all of the government.
[00:36:16.603 --> 00:36:17.184]  Think about it.
[00:36:17.544 --> 00:36:21.765]  The job of the CIA is to steal and to keep secrets.
[00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:25.807]  But we know more about the CIA than we do the Federal Reserve.
[00:36:26.474 --> 00:36:45.122]  The Federal Reserve is a private, completely unregulated bank, into which the Obama administration proposes to repose all regulatory authority, from the compensation of executives, to the investments companies make, to the location of their franchises, are you ready for this?
[00:36:45.522 --> 00:36:53.446]  To the amount of fat in McDonald's cheeseburgers, without appeal, and without stating reasons for the regulations.
[00:36:54.306 --> 00:36:55.727]  All grouped investments,
[00:36:56.408 --> 00:37:04.750]  Even if the investors own the group, like hedge funds, like you and your neighbors getting together to buy a house, will be subject to the Fed's new rules.
[00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:08.311]  All state-chartered banks will now be subject to the Fed.
[00:37:08.831 --> 00:37:17.013]  All businesses, whether financial in nature or not, that are owned by any financial institutions, shall be subject to the Fed.
[00:37:17.773 --> 00:37:23.734]  Even mom and pop shops and stores, if in the Fed's opinion could fail.
[00:37:24.352 --> 00:37:30.933]  And thus produce systemic harm to the economy shall be subject to the rule of the Fed.
[00:37:31.054 --> 00:37:32.234]  Alright, and it goes on from there.
[00:37:32.274 --> 00:37:34.654]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:37:34.694 --> 00:37:39.575]  Now I would add, I go on this show with Napolitano a few times and he comes on mine.
[00:37:40.196 --> 00:37:41.256]  It's an internet show.
[00:37:41.276 --> 00:37:42.656]  People keep thinking I'm on Fox.
[00:37:42.716 --> 00:37:44.196]  No, they're not putting me on Fox.
[00:37:44.757 --> 00:37:46.557]  They know everybody already knows on the internet.
[00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:50.958]  So they'll have this on the internet program that people think watching it
[00:37:51.844 --> 00:37:53.225]  Is on Fox TV, it's not.
[00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:57.226]  Why isn't this on Fox Television when Napolitano's on there?
[00:37:57.267 --> 00:38:00.968]  See, that's why we're pushing to make sure people at least know what's happening.
[00:38:00.988 --> 00:38:02.969]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is a best-selling author.
[00:38:03.629 --> 00:38:10.332]  His latest book in its newest edition is The Tyranny of Good Intentions, getting into the whole police state control grid and the courts.
[00:38:10.853 --> 00:38:18.356]  And he, of course, is a former Wall Street Journal editor, the head of policy, number two, the father of Reaganomics under Ronald Reagan.
[00:38:18.683 --> 00:38:21.904]  And so he can speak briefly to what's happening with the economy.
[00:38:21.944 --> 00:38:23.404]  Then I want to get into why he's really here.
[00:38:23.864 --> 00:38:29.166]  Iran, he's written some of the most in-depth, insightful articles we've seen about what's really happening there.
[00:38:29.486 --> 00:38:31.626]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, always great to have you with us.
[00:38:32.087 --> 00:38:32.647]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:38:33.387 --> 00:38:34.707]  Okay, you just heard Napolitano.
[00:38:34.727 --> 00:38:36.188]  I'm sure you're aware of this overhaul.
[00:38:36.228 --> 00:38:37.148]  What's your take on that?
[00:38:38.008 --> 00:38:43.210]  Well, the Federal Reserve has been such a total failure with less powers.
[00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:44.450]  Why would they want to give it more?
[00:38:45.205 --> 00:38:51.926]  You know, it was supposed to be the lend of last resort and prevent a contraction of the banking system.
[00:38:52.626 --> 00:38:53.146]  It failed.
[00:38:53.186 --> 00:38:54.307]  We had the Great Depression.
[00:38:55.647 --> 00:39:00.588]  It's supposed to have a stable, maintain a stable currency.
[00:39:00.608 --> 00:39:01.088]  It's failed.
[00:39:01.108 --> 00:39:05.669]  We've had amazing inflation in the post-World War II period.
[00:39:06.329 --> 00:39:11.030]  And it had completely failed in its regulatory obligations.
[00:39:12.634 --> 00:39:23.163]  So why give it more regulatory power, especially the kinds of powers that we just heard the judge describe, which have nothing to do with the original Fed charter?
[00:39:23.243 --> 00:39:29.969]  So I simply have to assume that something's afoot again.
[00:39:29.989 --> 00:39:35.133]  They're pulling another fast one on us, and they have some other agenda.
[00:39:36.744 --> 00:39:49.169]  Well, I agree with you, and imagine if the FBI, or the courts, or the Congress, or the President said, and I've read the bill, it's actually worse than Napolitano said, it said anything that affects a financial structure we can take over, it's even worse!
[00:39:49.229 --> 00:39:50.609]  It's everything!
[00:39:51.049 --> 00:39:54.591]  And then we've got this water bill that's about to pass the Senate, S-787,
[00:39:57.014 --> 00:40:05.496]  And this thing allows the feds to own quote all water supplies including wells, rainwater, ponds, aquifers.
[00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:09.056]  I mean my god this is getting, I can't even believe this Dr. Roberts.
[00:40:10.017 --> 00:40:18.018]  Yeah well it is an amazing grab of power and why they're doing that is not clear either.
[00:40:18.518 --> 00:40:21.959]  I do know some years back when they were persecuting
[00:40:23.177 --> 00:40:29.499]  People for building on lots for which they had state permits and the feds would come in and say, no, there's a wetland.
[00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:37.801]  And they were using this bill that had the term in it, the navigable waters of the United States.
[00:40:38.381 --> 00:40:41.102]  Well, of course, puddles aren't navigable waters.
[00:40:41.162 --> 00:40:42.623]  Neither are little streams.
[00:40:42.703 --> 00:40:47.104]  Neither are ranchers and farmers clearing out their drainage ditches.
[00:40:47.584 --> 00:40:49.965]  But they use that to regulate all of this.
[00:40:50.025 --> 00:40:50.545]  And finally,
[00:40:51.425 --> 00:41:05.177]  The point was made, this was a huge overreach, and the Clinton administration said, well, we won't punish the government for abusing its power, we'll just amend the law to reflect what they're doing.
[00:41:07.118 --> 00:41:17.527]  And so, it could be that that was the origin of this notion to give the federal government a claim over mud puddles and rainwater, so that
[00:41:19.409 --> 00:41:27.276]  They were to just sort of make legal what they were already doing under the navigable water interpretation.
[00:41:27.836 --> 00:41:42.189]  But why they would want all this power, or what they would do with it, I just, I mean, we're starting to get into the realm of, you know, police state science fiction.
[00:41:43.923 --> 00:41:44.544]  Absolutely.
[00:41:44.584 --> 00:41:50.288]  Well, when Mr. Police State Science Fiction Alex Jones is starting to think I'm in the Twilight Zone, we must be in trouble.
[00:41:50.308 --> 00:41:53.150]  Because, I mean, I can't believe how fast this is moving.
[00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:56.112]  Shifting gears into the main reason we have you here.
[00:41:56.132 --> 00:42:01.096]  Again, you're a real conservative, you know, who Ronald Reagan credited as being the father of Reaganomics.
[00:42:01.176 --> 00:42:04.438]  Biggest boom we've had in, you know, really the last 50, 60 years.
[00:42:04.958 --> 00:42:07.340]  Versus the fake conservatism of George Bush.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.241]  You criticized him.
[00:42:09.068 --> 00:42:17.778]  When Obama came in, and you were hopeful, but you've since, for those that haven't read your writings, said it looks like he may be even worse if that's possible.
[00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:23.380]  And then, everything Obama says, he says, no lobbyist, all he hires is lobbyists.
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.060]  He says, I'm going to end the wars, he expands the wars.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:30.601]  He says, I'm going to end the indefinite detention and torture, he expands it.
[00:42:31.061 --> 00:42:35.702]  And so when I saw him say he wants to be friends with Iran, I said, look out, covert operations.
[00:42:36.122 --> 00:42:42.784]  Bush's White House, I'm just filling folks in, admits they had covert operations going on to destabilize Iran.
[00:42:42.884 --> 00:42:44.144]  Obama has admitted that.
[00:42:45.335 --> 00:42:48.256]  Clearly, they're in there trying to foment things.
[00:42:48.396 --> 00:43:06.240]  I don't know who won the election either way, but certainly I agree with the articles you've been writing for your syndicated column, that regardless, our media is using this as a way to get the American people behind attacking Iran.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.461]  So, can you break down the facts?
[00:43:08.681 --> 00:43:11.461]  Plus, what you predicted days ago has now come out and we come back.
[00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:14.502]  We've got to break, Doctor.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:15.320]  Okay.
[00:43:33.908 --> 00:43:38.910]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful, and natural antioxidants found in red wine.
[00:43:39.231 --> 00:43:43.313]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[00:43:43.713 --> 00:43:47.855]  Now, you don't have to drink even a single drop, thanks to NuRev.
[00:43:48.135 --> 00:43:54.058]  NuRev is America's number one anti-aging supplement, thanks to its active ingredient resveratrol.
[00:43:54.338 --> 00:44:05.954]  Resveratrol is the main nutrient found in red wine and has been proven to help slow down the aging process, help you lose weight, override an unhealthy lifestyle, boost your energy level, and so much more.
[00:44:06.355 --> 00:44:11.222]  New Rev has been the subject of some of the most exciting anti-aging research in decades.
[00:44:11.462 --> 00:44:11.702]  Thank you.
[00:44:33.263 --> 00:44:33.503]  I'm good.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:48.761]  We're good to go!

[00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:39.248]  Providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:47:39.769 --> 00:47:40.429]  GCN.
[00:47:40.889 --> 00:47:42.851]  Great talk radio starts here.
[00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:50.653]  I'm looking at the London Guardian headline right now.
[00:47:50.693 --> 00:47:54.234]  British woman arrested and imprisoned for asking cop for badge number.
[00:47:54.754 --> 00:47:56.835]  Shows him choking her and beating her.
[00:47:57.475 --> 00:47:59.416]  And the police are saying that's the new policy.
[00:47:59.436 --> 00:48:01.197]  You ask us a question, we beat you.
[00:48:02.557 --> 00:48:03.858]  We'll talk to Dr. Roberts about that.
[00:48:03.918 --> 00:48:04.979]  His new book covers it.
[00:48:05.639 --> 00:48:08.382]  The issue here is, we've seen this in society over and over again.
[00:48:08.402 --> 00:48:12.225]  The reason I bring it up, as we get into Iran, is I don't support the Mullahs.
[00:48:12.785 --> 00:48:14.807]  I know governments tend to get corrupt and evil and bad.
[00:48:14.847 --> 00:48:20.251]  The point is, is that our government has overthrown them in 53 for people that don't know, and Dr. Roberts can speak to that.
[00:48:20.852 --> 00:48:23.494]  The issue is, they're in there fomenting this revolution.
[00:48:24.114 --> 00:48:26.716]  This guy's got connections to the CIA and MI6.
[00:48:28.252 --> 00:48:39.138]  We've clearly got color revolutions in there for people that don't know, and if the globalists, the people running our country, are able to bring down Iran, that's going to embolden them to attack more nations.
[00:48:39.218 --> 00:48:51.804]  So, that's my point here, and Dr. Roberts, I saw him three, four days ago, write editorials, and he'd show photos pointing out, why are these Iranians wearing green for the opposition candidate holding up signs?
[00:48:52.404 --> 00:48:52.624]  I don't
[00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:15.193]  And then cropping the photos to deceive people.
[00:49:15.213 --> 00:49:17.214]  So there's all sorts of chicanery.
[00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:29.005]  In fact, I'm not defending the security forces there, but if you watch those videos on YouTube carefully, there are people firing at the police, attacking their positions, burning cars, and the police are firing back.
[00:49:29.285 --> 00:49:30.426]  So all I'm saying is,
[00:49:30.922 --> 00:49:39.289]  There's deception going on, and I've seen Fox News saying, and CNN, oh, we ought to help the Iranians, we ought to give them support, we ought to try to overthrow them.
[00:49:39.709 --> 00:49:40.890]  That's deception, folks.
[00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:50.238]  The White House admits, and the last White House admits, they're in there manipulating this, they are in there pushing this, so why don't they just be honest?
[00:49:50.278 --> 00:49:50.918]  Dr. Roberts.
[00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:54.041]  Well, let me just give some facts.
[00:49:54.061 --> 00:49:56.263]  This is not anything to do with my opinion.
[00:49:57.684 --> 00:49:59.145]  We've known since May of 2007
[00:50:01.041 --> 00:50:22.976]  From ABC News, from the London Telegraph, from Seymour Hersh, the New Yorker, that President Bush had signed an authorization for a black ops group to destabilize the Iranian government and to topple it.
[00:50:23.097 --> 00:50:25.678]  So they've had that for two years.
[00:50:25.999 --> 00:50:28.000]  They've had an open-ended budget.
[00:50:28.747 --> 00:50:39.655]  We also know, there are press reports, that we have been funding not merely politically distant groups, but also terrorist groups.
[00:50:40.315 --> 00:50:40.596]  MEK.
[00:50:41.696 --> 00:50:42.877]  MEK, for example.
[00:50:44.939 --> 00:50:51.924]  Groups that are or were, before we began supporting them, on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations.
[00:50:52.004 --> 00:50:56.487]  And we know recently there have been bombings and assassinations.
[00:50:57.873 --> 00:51:02.315]  In Iran, carried out by these terrorist groups that we fund.
[00:51:04.837 --> 00:51:09.399]  So we know that there is this operation going.
[00:51:09.419 --> 00:51:10.760]  It's been going for two years.
[00:51:11.881 --> 00:51:25.428]  We also know, for example, that the National Endowment for Democracy funds dissident groups in
[00:51:26.472 --> 00:51:31.973]  Countries that we want to control, where we want to orchestrate a revolution, a color revolution.
[00:51:35.894 --> 00:51:49.056]  Recently, the arch neoconservative Kenneth Timmerman, who has an organization called Foundation for Democracy.
[00:51:53.476 --> 00:52:02.898]  It's funded by the National Endowment for Democracy, and the purpose of Timmerman's organization is to promote democracy in Iran.
[00:52:03.378 --> 00:52:07.819]  Now, here's what he wrote prior to the election.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:17.081]  He wrote, this is before anybody has voted in Iran, there's talk of a green revolution in Tehran.
[00:52:18.202 --> 00:52:19.282]  Well now, how would he know that?
[00:52:20.501 --> 00:52:22.262]  Unless it was an orchestrated plan.
[00:52:22.622 --> 00:52:33.446]  Why would there be a Green Revolution prepared prior to the vote, especially if Mousavi and his supporters were as confident of victory as they claim?
[00:52:34.246 --> 00:52:38.067]  In other words, this was all set up in advance.
[00:52:41.351 --> 00:52:50.997]  And Timmerman goes on to say that the National Endowment for Democracy, these are direct quotes, has spent millions of dollars promoting color revolutions.
[00:52:51.597 --> 00:53:04.345]  Some of that money appears to have made it into the hands of pro-Mussabi groups who have ties to non-governmental organizations outside Iran that the National Endowment for Democracy funds.
[00:53:04.785 --> 00:53:05.546]  So there we have it.
[00:53:05.766 --> 00:53:09.328]  It's no doubt that we're funding these people, including
[00:53:10.835 --> 00:53:11.496]  Absolutely, Doctor.
[00:53:11.516 --> 00:53:19.427]  And that's why your articles that we're having links to up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and up on CounterPunch.org and others are so important.
[00:53:19.467 --> 00:53:24.954]  But I'd like you to go back before you continue and we've got one more segment with you after the news and we appreciate the time.
[00:53:24.974 --> 00:53:26.276]  And it's this.
[00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:41.750]  On record, Sy Hersh actually in 2004 wrote that US forces were in there staging terror attacks, special forces were on the ground, that they had four groups, one Kurdish, three connected to Saudi Arabia, the Sunnis including
[00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:50.938]  The number three in Al Qaeda, this is mainstream news, blowing up mosques, bombing police stations, the Iranians have been suing the U.S.
[00:53:50.958 --> 00:53:51.559]  at the U.N.
[00:53:51.639 --> 00:54:07.154]  saying that our government's staging this, and then the White House, as you mentioned, in 2007 puts out a press release bragging they're doing it, and then I'm watching people last night on Fox News, I'm going to play a clip of the next segment, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cohen bragging
[00:54:07.834 --> 00:54:10.716]  About how they need to torture people and invade Iran.
[00:54:10.937 --> 00:54:15.540]  Then he goes on Fox to run Black Ops on the American people and says, I'm angry at Obama.
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:19.463]  He's not supporting the overthrow and these great freedom fighters.
[00:54:19.943 --> 00:54:23.206]  Knowing the whole thing's run by Bush and now still Obama.
[00:54:23.906 --> 00:54:28.130]  Cynical Black Ops behaving as if this whole thing isn't staged.
[00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:33.694]  While Al-Qaeda is attacking Iran when we're losing all our freedoms because of Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:34.697 --> 00:54:34.997]  Yeah.
[00:54:35.317 --> 00:54:37.538]  Well, you've got it figured out.
[00:54:38.798 --> 00:54:41.138]  And I think there's so many dead giveaways.
[00:54:41.198 --> 00:54:48.300]  For example, Mousavi declared his victory several hours before the polls closed.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.560]  Ah, yes, I remember that.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:56.962]  Now, see, this is classic CIA destabilization, because it discredits a contrary outcome.
[00:54:57.822 --> 00:55:14.286]  And it forces an early declaration of the vote, because along the time interval between the preemptive declaration of victory and the release of the vote tally, the longer Musavi and the CIA have to create the impression that the authorities are using the time to fix the vote.
[00:55:15.346 --> 00:55:18.267]  And it's just amazing to me that people don't see through this trick.
[00:55:19.372 --> 00:55:36.585]  Well, that's really a key point, and when I saw your article yesterday, I went and looked that up, and even an Iranian press TV and BBC, you're right, hours and hours before it was even completed, he was already declaring victory and saying he'd won by this giant margin.
[00:55:36.965 --> 00:55:42.109]  How could he know to put out the false idea that then, when he lost, it was a cheat?
[00:55:42.409 --> 00:55:45.812]  Yeah, that's the way you work it.
[00:55:47.092 --> 00:55:53.235]  And there are some other tell-tale things, for example... Well, it's based on a color.
[00:55:53.535 --> 00:55:55.056]  That's what George Soros always does.
[00:55:55.116 --> 00:55:55.857]  It's mindless.
[00:55:56.257 --> 00:55:59.278]  It's... Alex, let me get... Sorry, go ahead.
[00:56:01.179 --> 00:56:08.342]  You know, according to the Iranian experts that we have, there's no real difference between Mousavi and Ahmadinejad.
[00:56:09.443 --> 00:56:13.705]  And the notion this guy is a moderate is absurd because, look,
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:22.003]  First of all, there's no history of large-scale election fraud in the Iranian presidential races.
[00:56:22.444 --> 00:56:26.486]  If the Mullahs don't like a candidate, they just kick him off the ballot!
[00:56:28.086 --> 00:56:33.489]  So if they were worried about Mousavi winning and didn't want him to win, they just wouldn't have put him on the ballot.
[00:56:33.709 --> 00:56:42.453]  Who gets on the ballot is up to that council, that small council of Mullahs, to choose.
[00:56:43.644 --> 00:56:56.674]  And so obviously they didn't have any objections to him, and when Khatami, a liberal former, ran for president, the entire conservative establishment absolutely hated him, but they did nothing about it.
[00:56:56.734 --> 00:56:58.235]  He won both of his races.
[00:56:59.797 --> 00:57:07.983]  And if they don't cheat against a liberal outsider like Khatami, how in the world would they cheat against a pillar of the establishment like Mousavi?
[00:57:08.743 --> 00:57:13.167]  So the whole thing is, I think, that Mousavi
[00:57:14.457 --> 00:57:24.982]  The CIA knows how to manipulate disgruntled people, and they're using him to discredit the Iranian government.
[00:57:27.062 --> 00:57:35.526]  I don't think they'll be able to topple it, because it seems to be mainly westernized youth in Tehran making these protests.
[00:57:36.406 --> 00:57:40.588]  But whether they topple it or not, they've won, because they will have discredited
[00:57:41.432 --> 00:57:50.774]  The Iranian government, the Ayatollahs thought this election would increase the foreign legitimacy of the regime.
[00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:52.155]  Instead, it's decreased it.
[00:57:52.195 --> 00:57:58.716]  So now, Obama has a reason to say, well, we were going to do diplomacy, but it's failed.
[00:57:58.796 --> 00:57:59.696]  Look, they're crooks.
[00:57:59.716 --> 00:58:00.777]  They steal elections.
[00:58:01.597 --> 00:58:05.758]  And there's nothing left but sanctions and the military option.
[00:58:06.619 --> 00:58:13.506]  And John Bolton told, according to the London Telegraph, who printed this... Hold on, gotta break.
[00:58:13.646 --> 00:58:14.687]  We'll come back after the news.
[00:58:14.707 --> 00:58:21.234]  I gotta interrupt you and we'll get to this incredible info from Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts laying out every piece of information.
[00:58:21.434 --> 00:58:23.116]  This is completely staged, folks.

[01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:45.874]  Bloodshed in Albuquerque, New Mexico Saturday morning when armed robbers hit a crowded Denny's restaurant.

[01:01:05.624 --> 01:01:07.505]  Newly released data shows the U.S.

[01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:42.762]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[01:07:03.752 --> 01:07:10.556]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[01:07:11.396 --> 01:07:20.121]  That's right, it's syndicated across the nation, from Los Angeles, California to Miami, Florida, from Chicago, Illinois to Austin, Texas, I am Alex Jones.
[01:07:20.581 --> 01:07:25.904]  Final hour, your calls, and a lot more straight ahead as we chronicle the out-of-control tyranny.
[01:07:26.858 --> 01:07:29.500]  of the offshore global crime syndicate known as the New World Order.
[01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:47.111]  I interjected some of that last segment.
[01:07:47.131 --> 01:07:51.713]  So in this final segment, the 10 minutes we have with you, can you recap all those incredible points?
[01:07:51.733 --> 01:07:57.636]  And then you were getting to the punchline with Bolton, Bush's ambassador to the UN, bragging.
[01:07:57.656 --> 01:08:02.999]  And I noticed Dr. Jerome Corsi, who I've interviewed, suddenly didn't want to attack Iran a few years ago.
[01:08:03.299 --> 01:08:07.121]  He said, oh no, we're going to overthrow it with these great young people.
[01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:09.062]  And so, yeah, they're pretty public about this.
[01:08:09.442 --> 01:08:10.082]  Yeah.
[01:08:10.402 --> 01:08:13.884]  Listen, let me just give some more information, then I'll try to...
[01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.224]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:08:16.744 --> 01:08:27.051]  The London Telegraph reported on May 16, 2007 that they had had an editorial meeting with John Bolton, you know, the neocon warmonger in the Bush administration.
[01:08:28.091 --> 01:08:32.594]  And the Telegraph says that Bolton told them that a U.S.
[01:08:32.694 --> 01:08:41.800]  military attack on Iran would be a last option after attempts to format a popular revolution had failed.
[01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:47.819]  So, it's quite clear that this is the American hand.
[01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:53.263]  I think it's also clear that some of these young people are very sincere.
[01:08:53.283 --> 01:09:06.313]  They're secularized, they're westernized, they're trying to free themselves from the Islamic moral codes so they can be like teenagers and young people in the United States.
[01:09:10.009 --> 01:09:13.411]  But they're being, you know, they're serving the CIA's purpose.
[01:09:13.431 --> 01:09:18.474]  They're going to end up with a puppet regime like they had before when we installed the Shah.
[01:09:19.034 --> 01:09:38.645]  Now, I also have an email from one of these, you know, hacker-spammer-knowledgeable-type people, and he said that he was struck by the sudden appearance of 30,000 Iran-related tweets, you know, in this Twitter thing they have now, and that just suddenly
[01:09:39.255 --> 01:09:42.196]  Jumped up and he looked into it and this is what he found.
[01:09:43.436 --> 01:09:48.597]  That each of these new sites had created their Twitter accounts on Saturday, June the 13th.
[01:09:50.377 --> 01:09:54.478]  Each had an extremely high number of tweets that's creating their profiles.
[01:09:55.379 --> 01:09:59.499]  Iran election was their most popular keyword.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.440]  They were posting in English.
[01:10:02.705 --> 01:10:12.591]  Half of them had the exact same profile photo, and they each had thousands of followers and only a few friends, and their friends were each other.
[01:10:13.711 --> 01:10:23.276]  So he looks into this, and he narrows the spammers down to three of the most persistent, and does further research.
[01:10:24.877 --> 01:10:30.400]  He finds, for example, that within hours of the three of these
[01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:34.047]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:11:01.145 --> 01:11:08.417]  Uh, put out more disinformation and get young people all over the world behind the overthrow.
[01:11:09.287 --> 01:11:10.828]  Of the regime.
[01:11:11.088 --> 01:11:21.953]  And we know the United States did that in 1953 with the British, the exact same way, but by staging terror attacks and claiming the elected president, Mohammad Mosaddegh, had attacked the Muslim extremists.
[01:11:21.973 --> 01:11:30.077]  So last time, they manipulated the Muslim extremists into overthrowing Time Magazine poet, liberal, throwing Mosaddegh out.
[01:11:30.317 --> 01:11:32.678]  This time they're going to use the liberals to throw the Mullahs out.
[01:11:34.559 --> 01:11:36.740]  That's the plan, and you see,
[01:11:37.682 --> 01:11:40.044]  And there are splits among the Mullahs.
[01:11:40.084 --> 01:11:50.873]  For example, Ahmadinejad is reported by the lying Western media to be some kind of a right-wing guy that's in thick with the Mullahs.
[01:11:51.253 --> 01:12:00.921]  Well, the fact of the matter, he has spent most of the recent presidential campaign campaigning against the corruption of the Mullahs.
[01:12:01.641 --> 01:12:06.305]  In particular, the one he beat in the last election, that's Rafsanjani.
[01:12:07.105 --> 01:12:09.746]  Which, who is Mousavi's main backer.
[01:12:12.226 --> 01:12:17.727]  So, the Mullahs, most of the Mullahs are against Ahmadinejad.
[01:12:18.687 --> 01:12:21.768]  Because he has brought these corruption charges.
[01:12:21.808 --> 01:12:27.329]  You see, people in the countryside think the Mullahs have too much wealth and power and their lifestyle reflects it.
[01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:28.669]  Well, they do, yeah.
[01:12:28.809 --> 01:12:31.690]  And he made, that's what he campaigned on.
[01:12:34.798 --> 01:12:39.540]  But we don't get that information, but this is absolutely a fact.
[01:12:40.961 --> 01:12:50.145]  Well, I was going to say, the guy he's running against is back to the core of the founding and even tied into some Iran conference stuff, so he certainly has spook connections.
[01:12:51.606 --> 01:12:53.927]  Right, and he was the Prime Minister for eight years.
[01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:55.807]  Not the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister.
[01:12:56.068 --> 01:12:57.528]  When it was the most oppressive regime.
[01:12:57.568 --> 01:12:59.049]  When it was the most oppressive.
[01:12:59.129 --> 01:13:03.511]  So, the notion that he's a reformer and
[01:13:04.523 --> 01:13:15.209]  You see, if the Muellers were afraid of him, they would have simply thrown him off the ballot, because they decide who gets to run for president.
[01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:16.309]  The Committee of Experts.
[01:13:16.469 --> 01:13:18.630]  Yeah, the Committee of Experts, whatever they're called.
[01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:19.991]  I can't remember the group's name.
[01:13:21.752 --> 01:13:28.255]  So, I think that for some reason, he was disaffected.
[01:13:28.355 --> 01:13:33.278]  They didn't know that, and he has
[01:13:34.045 --> 01:13:37.767]  He's either being manipulated by the CIA or he's in with them.
[01:13:48.903 --> 01:13:51.264]  But regardless, CIA fingerprints are all over it.
[01:13:51.284 --> 01:13:53.185]  They admit they're running it, so here's the question.
[01:13:53.625 --> 01:14:06.189]  Is this, in your opinion, and I think it's an expert opinion, Dr. Roberts, is this an attempt to discredit them in the American people's eyes, in the world's eyes, so the world will accept a NATO-slash-US-Israeli strike on Iran?
[01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:07.169]  Yes, that's it.
[01:14:08.691 --> 01:14:10.493]  Or it's to overthrow them.
[01:14:10.733 --> 01:14:17.679]  So either way they win and so all these dumb kids don't know they're about to bring in shock and awe in all their cities level.
[01:14:17.699 --> 01:14:19.001]  They're not going to be idiots.
[01:14:19.681 --> 01:14:25.226]  Those young secularized, westernized protesters are idiots.
[01:14:25.546 --> 01:14:30.611]  They're dupes of the CIA and they're either going to end up with an American puppet government
[01:14:31.047 --> 01:14:38.150]  Oh, they're going to have thousands of people killed and their beautiful country destroyed in an American military strike.
[01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:39.471]  One or the other is going to happen.
[01:14:40.091 --> 01:14:40.751]  And you just said it.
[01:14:40.892 --> 01:14:43.073]  Very modernized, very beautiful country.
[01:14:43.553 --> 01:14:45.133]  The big bankers don't like that.
[01:14:45.594 --> 01:14:46.074]  That's right.
[01:14:46.794 --> 01:14:49.255]  And not only that, you see, Iran is
[01:14:51.538 --> 01:14:55.460]  Getting connected with Russia and China and that new organization.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.060]  Shanghai Cooperative.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:02.903]  That then gives them essentially 60% of the world's oil reserves.
[01:15:05.124 --> 01:15:06.624]  And of course, we don't like that either.
[01:15:06.664 --> 01:15:07.585]  We don't want that.
[01:15:08.405 --> 01:15:09.486]  So what do we do about this?
[01:15:09.586 --> 01:15:09.846]  Nothing.
[01:15:09.866 --> 01:15:15.388]  I guess Obama's going to blow Iran to bits and all the liberals will say, oh great, he's giving them freedom.
[01:15:16.108 --> 01:15:16.609]  That's it.
[01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:17.089]  Just like Iraq.
[01:15:18.198 --> 01:15:21.819]  A million dead, four million refugees, and we've given them freedom.
[01:15:21.839 --> 01:15:25.561]  The whole country's destroyed, just like we're doing in Afghanistan.
[01:15:26.601 --> 01:15:30.303]  And, you know, why the world puts up with this?
[01:15:31.463 --> 01:15:31.763]  I don't know.
[01:15:31.823 --> 01:15:33.904]  I think it's because we just give them money.
[01:15:33.964 --> 01:15:42.387]  So maybe if we have an economic collapse, the world will have a chance to go its own way and realize its own aspirations.
[01:15:42.487 --> 01:15:46.609]  But for now, it looks like the American hegemony is prevailing.
[01:15:47.863 --> 01:15:51.848]  But meanwhile, American hegemony is raping us, the American people as well.
[01:15:52.289 --> 01:15:54.912]  They're eluding us, so it's... Eluding us, yeah.
[01:15:55.373 --> 01:16:00.018]  But as you said earlier, you know, they're getting power over all the money, over everybody's business.
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.623]  It's just... It's an amazing...
[01:16:04.315 --> 01:16:14.442]  You know, it's actually, as I said the other day, there's really no difference between the American Citizens Day and the fictional citizens in George Orwell's book, 1984.
[01:16:14.602 --> 01:16:22.928]  Dr. Roberts, we appreciate your integrity, your research, the incredible amount of data you brought together, because I was trying to figure this out, and you really did a great job.
[01:16:23.008 --> 01:16:24.529]  Thank you for spending Father's Day with us.
[01:16:24.549 --> 01:16:25.370]  Give back to your family.
[01:16:25.410 --> 01:16:25.950]  God bless you.
[01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:27.251]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:16:27.731 --> 01:16:30.994]  There goes Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of Reaganomics, a real conservative.
[01:16:31.274 --> 01:16:32.275]  We'll be right back with more.
[01:16:32.295 --> 01:16:32.675]  Stay with us.
[01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:36.913]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:16:37.073 --> 01:16:41.156]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:16:41.336 --> 01:16:52.766]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:16:52.986 --> 01:16:58.831]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:16:59.111 --> 01:17:03.476]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:17:03.776 --> 01:17:11.784]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:17:11.984 --> 01:17:19.632]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.
[01:17:20.132 --> 01:17:27.535]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com, that's U-T-O-P-I-A-Silver dot com, or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338, and help us win this battle.

[01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:41.891]  And let's take in a brief mind movie.
[01:17:42.371 --> 01:17:47.834]  We're surrounded by jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[01:17:48.054 --> 01:17:53.657]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[01:17:53.857 --> 01:17:55.517]  The stimulus package is working.
[01:17:55.858 --> 01:17:57.378]  A bailout is coming your way.
[01:17:57.739 --> 01:18:01.660]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[01:18:01.941 --> 01:18:02.261]  Pardon me?
[01:18:03.081 --> 01:18:04.061]  Back to the real world.
[01:18:04.321 --> 01:18:08.283]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:10.603]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[01:18:11.143 --> 01:18:12.604]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[01:18:12.844 --> 01:18:23.607]  Please call me, John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, to discuss investing in precious metals, gold and silver, with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.
[01:18:24.307 --> 01:18:31.309]  I'm John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and together we'll create a package that really works for you.
[01:18:34.404 --> 01:18:37.025]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:18:37.425 --> 01:18:42.386]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:18:42.746 --> 01:18:44.486]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:49.607]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:18:49.787 --> 01:18:50.747]  How much do you want?
[01:18:50.967 --> 01:18:51.727]  When do you want it?
[01:18:52.088 --> 01:18:53.708]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:18:53.988 --> 01:18:54.808]  When will you need it?
[01:18:55.048 --> 01:18:57.128]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:18:57.268 --> 01:18:58.369]  Will there be any food?
[01:18:58.609 --> 01:18:59.909]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:19:00.129 --> 01:19:05.191]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:19:05.391 --> 01:19:08.553]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:19:08.973 --> 01:19:12.474]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:19:12.794 --> 01:19:13.775]  How much will you need?
[01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:14.635]  We don't know.
[01:19:14.915 --> 01:19:15.836]  How much do you want?
[01:19:16.036 --> 01:19:16.776]  All you can get.
[01:19:16.956 --> 01:19:17.816]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:18.057 --> 01:19:20.798]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:20:37.701 --> 01:20:38.682]  Search no more.
[01:20:39.203 --> 01:20:42.245]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:47.048 --> 01:20:50.170]  Yeah, those Iranian teenagers are gonna get what they want.
[01:20:50.210 --> 01:20:51.711]  Those cities completely leveled.
[01:20:52.492 --> 01:20:53.813]  And they're gonna put in hardcore.
[01:20:54.594 --> 01:20:58.356]  Muslim extremists over them, just like Iraq.
[01:20:58.636 --> 01:21:00.857]  60% of the graduates of college were women, the doctors.
[01:21:02.078 --> 01:21:03.279]  Rock and roll music was on.
[01:21:04.079 --> 01:21:04.820]  Not anymore.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:08.982]  They're all wearing the burqas and CIA's in command.
[01:21:11.363 --> 01:21:14.625]  I tell ya, the key to the whole New World Order is Muslim extremists.
[01:21:14.645 --> 01:21:15.866]  More and more I realize this.
[01:21:15.886 --> 01:21:18.247]  They are the magic key, the sword of death.
[01:21:18.965 --> 01:21:19.985]  They are the little secret.
[01:21:20.386 --> 01:21:30.169]  Because you got these mullahs, Shiites, Sunni, both sides, they got mind-controlled people that will blow themselves up and think they're doing it for Allah, and they always work for the British government.
[01:21:31.249 --> 01:21:35.891]  I mean, when you really get down to it, and that's what the head mullah came out and said, this is the British government.
[01:21:36.451 --> 01:21:41.433]  Because, you know, he knows, because they've been fighting those guys and working with them for decades.
[01:21:41.473 --> 01:21:42.353]  It goes back and forth.
[01:21:42.373 --> 01:21:46.475]  This is like chess, ladies and gentlemen, but ten times more complex.
[01:21:49.059 --> 01:21:51.781]  And we're here looking at this huge chess board.
[01:21:51.961 --> 01:21:54.783]  I can't get the American people to even realize we're playing chess.
[01:21:55.063 --> 01:21:56.143]  That there's a game on.
[01:21:56.163 --> 01:21:57.824]  That this is real.
[01:21:58.145 --> 01:22:00.406]  That there's powerful elites and subterfuge.
[01:22:00.446 --> 01:22:04.428]  In fact, I want to play this clip and your calls are coming up.
[01:22:04.829 --> 01:22:07.350]  And I got Sir Hudeberg coming in here to talk about this bill.
[01:22:08.171 --> 01:22:09.892]  You can't make this stuff up anymore.
[01:22:09.912 --> 01:22:12.353]  I mean, who could come up with this?
[01:22:12.453 --> 01:22:14.354]  I couldn't imagine things this ridiculous.
[01:22:14.955 --> 01:22:17.056]  But the reason I thought of this guy
[01:22:18.985 --> 01:22:20.465]  Months ago, I meant to play this.
[01:22:21.686 --> 01:22:24.546]  I didn't do it, but last night, I'm at the office at about 10 o'clock at night.
[01:22:25.227 --> 01:22:30.868]  They're re-airing Geraldo Rivera's show, and there's like these weird zombie redcoats.
[01:22:30.928 --> 01:22:33.069]  I say zombie, they looked like they were out of their minds.
[01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:41.951]  With these vacant stairs, playing Revolutionary War music, but British tunes, with our soldiers, on the set with him.
[01:22:42.571 --> 01:22:46.232]  And I was like, they're playing Revolutionary anti-
[01:22:49.036 --> 01:22:51.838]  You know, colonialist music, and it was some weird message.
[01:22:51.878 --> 01:22:58.984]  And I keep seeing redcoats with our troops at White House events and at events at Arlington Cemetery.
[01:22:59.024 --> 01:23:00.965]  It's like a desecrating us.
[01:23:00.985 --> 01:23:04.768]  And I'm not, I'm not a Anglophile phobe.
[01:23:04.788 --> 01:23:06.570]  I mean, I don't dislike the British.
[01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:10.253]  I mean, my last name's Jones and I have two guys that work for me in England, great, smart people.
[01:23:11.073 --> 01:23:12.334]  I'm saying the elite of England.
[01:23:12.815 --> 01:23:18.299]  So I'm sitting there watching this as we sit there in the coffee room watching Fox News.
[01:23:19.608 --> 01:23:21.489]  And then it cuts to Lt.
[01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:21.870]  Col.
[01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:27.714]  Bill Cohen, and he's saying, I tell you what, Geraldo, I just think we ought to be over there helping them.
[01:23:27.754 --> 01:23:36.581]  It's despicable that Obama's trying to stop us from freeing these people, that we're not giving support to these great Iranians, that he's saying every other day.
[01:23:36.601 --> 01:23:38.962]  He wants to turn into a glass parking lot, but suddenly he loves them.
[01:23:39.663 --> 01:23:43.146]  And suddenly, you know, they're all for police brutality here, but oh my gosh, they're doing it over there.
[01:23:43.166 --> 01:23:43.566]  It's bad.
[01:23:45.123 --> 01:23:46.804]  And think of how that PSYOP works.
[01:23:46.884 --> 01:23:48.684]  They're funding the whole thing on record.
[01:23:48.704 --> 01:23:50.525]  They're staging the whole thing on record.
[01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:52.886]  They're lying and twisting everything.
[01:23:53.166 --> 01:24:04.069]  He knows that, and there he is lying to the American people, with pleasure, knowing it's all a lie, saying, we ought to be supporting him, Obama isn't supporting him, which gives Obama left cover.
[01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.869]  See?
[01:24:05.109 --> 01:24:12.772]  Oh, now the left will be, oh, see, he's an anti-war guy, and the right wing will hate Barack Obama, and that reinforces the controlled Republican Party.
[01:24:14.145 --> 01:24:20.208]  And all these CIA operatives, and that's what Bill Cohen is, he admits he's worked with them in Beirut and other places, and Mossad.
[01:24:22.328 --> 01:24:33.273]  That's, it's all about reaffirming that false left-right paradigm and giving Obama left cover when it was the big New Brzezinski's running this entire operation as his national security advisor's top advisor.
[01:24:34.036 --> 01:24:37.118]  So he's like the supervisor over his National Security Advisor.
[01:24:37.398 --> 01:24:38.779]  He's the real power behind the throne.
[01:24:39.079 --> 01:24:43.483]  And we predicted all of this in the Obama deception, in all the interviews I have for the second film coming out soon.
[01:24:43.783 --> 01:24:44.864]  It's all about this already.
[01:24:44.884 --> 01:24:46.425]  We're already predicting this film.
[01:24:47.505 --> 01:24:48.346]  What's now happening?
[01:24:48.386 --> 01:24:49.207]  It's just incredible.
[01:24:49.547 --> 01:24:57.232]  So, the issue here that I'm trying to get to is, it made me think of Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cohen.
[01:24:59.394 --> 01:24:59.734]  Because,
[01:25:01.022 --> 01:25:17.627]  I remember Rumsfeld in 2002 and Bush going, we're taking off the gloves and the torture memos, ordering the torture, and how they were waterboarding them and bragging on Fox News, how they were stopping their hearts with medical devices and torturing them, much worse than waterboarding, and how they were getting fake confessions.
[01:25:17.667 --> 01:25:26.430]  And Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, supposed number two in Al-Qaeda, they got him to confess to bombing buildings that weren't built until four years after he was in jail.
[01:25:27.412 --> 01:25:34.698]  So six years of being waterboarded, they admit, hundreds of times, two times a day for almost six years.
[01:25:35.278 --> 01:25:44.125]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed confessed to everything but killing Kennedy, killing, you know, sinking the Lusitania, the Titanic, crucifying Jesus.
[01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:47.688]  I mean, he, and they put out on the news he'd done this.
[01:25:48.188 --> 01:25:50.790]  He had bombed buildings that didn't exist when he was arrested.
[01:25:51.519 --> 01:25:55.962]  And they admitted that they threatened his family, that was in the news, that they tortured his kids.
[01:25:56.282 --> 01:26:04.308]  The Washington Post bragged and said, yeah, they tortured him for years, he wouldn't say he did it, so they got his kids in there and started doing it, and he said, fine, I'll say whatever you want.
[01:26:04.888 --> 01:26:08.051]  Totally made up, he was clearly a CIA operative they were setting up.
[01:26:08.591 --> 01:26:16.036]  So, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cohen, shelling at a conference, a news conference, and then making the joke about, is this on record?
[01:26:16.116 --> 01:26:18.478]  Oh, I don't care if it is, when he knew it was a press conference.
[01:26:19.619 --> 01:26:29.004]  This is Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cohen at a press conference in Los Angeles bragging and selling, oh, I'm not for waterboarding, I'm from electricity, but only if it saves our troops.
[01:26:29.304 --> 01:26:34.547]  When you know it's only good for fake confessions and only good for tyranny and terror over the people.
[01:26:35.047 --> 01:26:36.908]  It's so sick, but it gets worse.
[01:26:37.769 --> 01:26:38.609]  You can pull this up.
[01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:40.270]  This has been in the Associated Press.
[01:26:40.690 --> 01:26:44.432]  They have arrested dozens and dozens of people.
[01:26:45.113 --> 01:26:47.414]  It's got to be over 30 or 40 that I've seen in the news alone.
[01:26:48.976 --> 01:26:59.922]  At Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, places like that, and Iraq, because it'll come out that they tortured somebody or they sodomized them with large objects dripping with battery acid.
[01:26:59.942 --> 01:27:01.063]  That's in the Army's own report.
[01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:03.484]  And so Bush and them said, we didn't order that!
[01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:04.485]  Arrest them!
[01:27:04.585 --> 01:27:09.908]  And then they send these people who followed orders to prison, and guess how they keep them from blowing the whistle?
[01:27:09.928 --> 01:27:11.329]  In fact, you can Google this.
[01:27:11.369 --> 01:27:12.029]  Google this, guys.
[01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:14.671]  Torture guard
[01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:16.952]  Silenced under Patriot Act.
[01:27:17.252 --> 01:27:27.782]  They use anti-terror rules on the torturers that followed orders to shut them up so Bush and Rumsfeld and Gonzales and all these sickos won't go to prison.
[01:27:28.683 --> 01:27:38.773]  And so they sent a whole bunch of these people to prison that followed orders, the White House orders are now public, and then the White House says they never ordered torture, and then last year
[01:27:39.850 --> 01:27:40.971]  This is just late last year, 2008.
[01:27:42.872 --> 01:27:46.954]  Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cohen goes on TV and brags that he tortures people.
[01:27:47.334 --> 01:27:51.616]  So, they're allowed to brag they're torturing people, then they send their own patsies to jail.
[01:27:52.636 --> 01:27:55.017]  I mean, that's who you work for, CIA.
[01:27:55.258 --> 01:27:57.639]  I hear the CIA ads recruiting for domestic operations.
[01:27:57.859 --> 01:27:58.979]  Listen, you dumb kids.
[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:00.340]  They're going to set you up.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:01.861]  They're all into lying to you.
[01:28:01.881 --> 01:28:03.141]  They work for offshore banks.
[01:28:03.362 --> 01:28:04.682]  They want to destroy this country.
[01:28:05.323 --> 01:28:06.123]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[01:28:06.849 --> 01:28:08.931]  Everything I say here or not is on the record.
[01:28:08.991 --> 01:28:09.611]  I hope it is.
[01:28:09.711 --> 01:28:10.151]  It always is.
[01:28:10.212 --> 01:28:15.115]  I'd like to go on the record as saying we've talked about torture here last night and this morning.
[01:28:15.135 --> 01:28:16.696]  I do not like waterboarding.
[01:28:17.657 --> 01:28:18.858]  I do not like waterboarding.
[01:28:19.358 --> 01:28:20.439]  I prefer electricity.
[01:28:20.459 --> 01:28:24.822]  Yeah, little kids getting raped.
[01:28:24.862 --> 01:28:25.343]  Real funny.
[01:28:25.363 --> 01:28:31.327]  I stand by that statement and it concerns me quite a bit that John McCain is already seated
[01:28:32.305 --> 01:28:34.827]  Uh, interrogation techniques to certain people.
[01:28:34.907 --> 01:28:40.650]  I would never, for a moment, use harsh techniques, and I have used them, on just anybody.
[01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:43.012]  But, you know, sometimes there are certain people.
[01:28:43.052 --> 01:28:43.372]  Yeah.
[01:28:43.432 --> 01:28:44.893]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[01:28:45.033 --> 01:28:45.874]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[01:28:45.914 --> 01:28:46.894]  That's enough from the punk.
[01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:47.354]  That's enough.
[01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:49.136]  Like his kids got tortured?
[01:28:49.156 --> 01:28:49.836]  You mean like him?
[01:28:50.797 --> 01:28:52.297]  They take your soul, folks.
[01:28:52.658 --> 01:28:53.658]  He is selling you.
[01:28:53.678 --> 01:28:54.859]  He's all in deception.
[01:28:54.899 --> 01:28:57.941]  They all sit around laughing how they manipulate and deceive people.
[01:28:58.476 --> 01:29:04.399]  Like he went on the news last night and said, I wish we were supporting the overthrow of Iran right now, when he knows the whole thing's being run.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.641]  They'll take your farm and ranch too, folks!
[01:29:08.941 --> 01:29:12.122]  If they'll kill a million three hundred thousand Iraqis, they'll kill you dead in a hammer!
[01:29:12.763 --> 01:29:16.364]  And they're building a giant force of sickos like him, that are ready to do it!
[01:29:16.745 --> 01:29:24.208]  Well, I'm a real red-blooded American, and I'm not part of torturing kids, you son of a... Listen to me, we're gonna beat you people, and we're not scared of you!
[01:29:25.309 --> 01:29:26.029]  Sicko filth!
[01:29:34.873 --> 01:29:35.753]  Spring is here.
[01:29:36.013 --> 01:29:36.793]  Growing season.
[01:29:36.973 --> 01:29:38.954]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:29:39.154 --> 01:29:40.554]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:29:40.874 --> 01:29:41.534]  Think about it.

[01:32:40.912 --> 01:32:47.197]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[01:32:47.437 --> 01:32:48.478]  Have a glass of water.
[01:32:48.978 --> 01:32:54.302]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other chemicals?
[01:32:54.642 --> 01:32:55.423]  Of course you can't.
[01:32:55.683 --> 01:33:00.526]  The air that you breathe and the water you drink should help maintain good health, not take away from it.

[01:33:32.008 --> 01:33:36.191]  You're listening to GCN.
[01:33:37.752 --> 01:33:40.194]  The Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[01:33:46.594 --> 01:33:48.116]  I normally take more phone calls.
[01:33:48.216 --> 01:33:49.077]  I apologize.
[01:33:49.177 --> 01:33:52.420]  There's just so much news I was covering, and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.923]  The toll-free number to join us now is 877-590-5525.
[01:33:57.045 --> 01:33:58.226]  All over the country, 877-590-5525.
[01:33:58.246 --> 01:34:06.014]  And if you're listening to us out of the flagship station we transmit and syndicate out of, NewsRadio 590K LBJ, it's 836-0590.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:14.662]  In a moment I'm going to get into one of the biggest federal land grabs, if not the biggest ever.
[01:34:15.162 --> 01:34:17.183]  And I read the bill, I can't believe I'm in America.
[01:34:17.203 --> 01:34:20.085]  And I'm Alex Jones, I expect all of this.
[01:34:20.505 --> 01:34:29.469]  And then the Federal Reserve, offshore owned, is announcing it's taking over the entire country, all businesses, no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, makes the Patriot Act look like heaven.
[01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:36.712]  I'm going to recap that and then go to your calls, but I wanted to bring up Sarah Hudeberg because I forget the news we cover how bad it is.
[01:34:37.116 --> 01:34:41.839]  A week and a half, two weeks ago, a caller calls and he goes, have you seen the Clean Water Restoration Act, 787?
[01:34:42.059 --> 01:34:42.700]  And I go, no.
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.222]  I pull it up, it says a puddle, rainwater, anything.
[01:34:46.242 --> 01:34:48.724]  The feds own your property, they can shut it down, they can take it.
[01:34:49.164 --> 01:34:52.286]  Worse than the animal ID, worse than the premises ID for takeover.
[01:34:53.704 --> 01:34:56.188]  I read it and it says no warrants, come on your property.
[01:34:56.208 --> 01:34:57.630]  They're going to set up new divisions.
[01:34:57.670 --> 01:34:59.793]  This is the way the Green Corps is going to get on your property.
[01:34:59.813 --> 01:35:04.861]  And the New York Times reported Thursday that they're hiring felons for Obama's Green Corps.
[01:35:05.162 --> 01:35:05.582]  Felons!
[01:35:05.622 --> 01:35:07.165]  Look, you can't make this up.
[01:35:07.325 --> 01:35:09.268]  Felons are coming to your ranch and farm.
[01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:15.270]  I was looking at, like, five acres out in the hill country on a creek and thinking, oh, can I get that place to run to with my family?
[01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:16.150]  Now it won't matter!
[01:35:16.170 --> 01:35:20.311]  Little guys with ponytails and machine guns are going to show up and say, lick my boots or you're going to die!
[01:35:20.791 --> 01:35:21.971]  And this isn't a joke!
[01:35:22.411 --> 01:35:23.751]  Text of S.
[01:35:24.112 --> 01:35:27.592]  787 Clean Water Restoration Act, and some folks in the state are upset.
[01:35:27.652 --> 01:35:28.352]  I've read about this.
[01:35:28.372 --> 01:35:31.033]  Again, this is Texas fighting, and other states, I guess, aren't.
[01:35:32.313 --> 01:35:35.854]  I know that Sarah Hudeberg, a reporter here at NewsRadio 590K LBJ, also
[01:35:39.298 --> 01:35:44.499]  I have some clips of some of the Cattlemen Association groups, but this is a show all over the nation.
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:53.182]  Please fight S-787, because this sucker has passed out a committee going to the full Senate, and they're saying they've got the votes for this.
[01:35:53.322 --> 01:35:55.843]  I mean, again, total takeover.
[01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:57.423]  Sarah Huteberg, tell us what's going on.
[01:35:57.743 --> 01:36:07.326]  Hey Alex, yes, the bill, it already made it out of the Senate committee, and as you already said, it gives the federal government authority over all water in the United States, even on privately owned land.
[01:36:07.947 --> 01:36:10.091]  And KLBJ talked to Jason Skaggs.
[01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:13.316]  He's with the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association.
[01:36:13.357 --> 01:36:15.781]  I'm just gonna go ahead and play a sound clip of him right now.
[01:36:16.738 --> 01:36:28.742]  Essentially this bill would make every stock tank, every creek, puddle, stream, any kind of water body in the state of Texas would be under the jurisdiction of the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers.
[01:36:29.103 --> 01:36:34.445]  A bill which we feel is one of the largest land grabs in recent memory by the U.S.
[01:36:34.485 --> 01:36:34.945]  Congress.
[01:36:35.025 --> 01:36:40.947]  This bill would remove the term navigable from the definition of waters of the U.S.
[01:36:41.067 --> 01:36:41.787]  Sarah, thanks for that report.
[01:36:41.807 --> 01:36:47.688]  You say you've got family that are in ranching, so do I. They've all been harassed building a new barn, anything under the
[01:37:06.389 --> 01:37:10.731]  Uh, Wetlands Act, and so people litigated and defeated that because there was no federal jurisdiction.
[01:37:10.771 --> 01:37:15.113]  If you had a puddle, they would try to, uh, force you off your land or force you to sell.
[01:37:15.293 --> 01:37:21.255]  Austin has land grabbed over 20,000 acres under the guise of that, and later they built hotels on it with their buddies.
[01:37:21.915 --> 01:37:23.756]  Uh, but, uh, give us your, uh, quick take on that.
[01:37:24.301 --> 01:37:30.786]  Well, actually, I do have an uncle who's a cattle rancher near Victoria, Texas, and I know that he would not be happy to hear about this bill at all.
[01:37:31.247 --> 01:37:35.570]  And the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, they're urging the U.S.
[01:37:35.610 --> 01:37:38.953]  Senators from Texas to vote no on this Clean Water Restoration Act.
[01:37:39.333 --> 01:37:45.718]  And hopefully that will happen, because this is just the government continuing to find ways to regulate the lives and freedoms of Americans.
[01:37:46.219 --> 01:37:46.659]  Absolutely.
[01:37:46.699 --> 01:37:48.500]  Plus, we have a 10th and 9th Amendment.
[01:37:48.981 --> 01:37:50.762]  I mean, the feds have never been able to do this before.
[01:37:50.842 --> 01:37:52.063]  Why are they doing it now?
[01:37:54.178 --> 01:37:55.739]  I don't know.
[01:37:55.779 --> 01:37:57.020]  They're just trying to find more ways.
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:01.984]  I mean, more ways to take away our rights and get into the privately owned things in our lives.
[01:38:02.424 --> 01:38:03.104]  Absolutely.
[01:38:03.605 --> 01:38:04.205]  Absolutely.
[01:38:04.265 --> 01:38:08.088]  Well, I know you're going to continue to cover this here at NewsRadio 590 KLBJ.
[01:38:08.128 --> 01:38:09.349]  Sarah Hudeberg, thanks for coming on.
[01:38:09.489 --> 01:38:09.689]  Sure.
[01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:10.190]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.670]  You bet.
[01:38:10.690 --> 01:38:11.470]  Thanks for that report.
[01:38:12.411 --> 01:38:21.137]  Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, I'm like somebody in a batting cage and they got five machines turned up on high speed shooting balls at me and I can't hit half of them.
[01:38:21.177 --> 01:38:23.019]  I mean, and I'm getting hit in the head with them.
[01:38:25.239 --> 01:38:39.084]  And then I have all this mainstream news where world leaders are meeting, calling for one-child policies and forced population reductions, and I read it from mainstream news on air and I come in and I hear Dr. Dina Dell on the air before I go on saying none of it exists.
[01:38:39.704 --> 01:38:39.904]  No.
[01:38:40.705 --> 01:38:41.345]  S-787 does exist.
[01:38:44.935 --> 01:38:46.256]  I mean, it's insane!
[01:38:46.596 --> 01:38:48.397]  That's why I played Napolitano earlier.
[01:38:48.858 --> 01:38:55.162]  For a week, I've been ranting and raving saying this new bill allows the Federal Reserve to run everything and take everything over.
[01:38:55.402 --> 01:38:57.323]  In fact, they don't even need this 787.
[01:38:58.144 --> 01:38:59.524]  They can control all the waterways.
[01:39:00.065 --> 01:39:03.007]  Anything connected to commerce or the economy, they run it.
[01:39:03.227 --> 01:39:05.848]  And that's what all the martial law executive orders state.
[01:39:06.729 --> 01:39:14.434]  It's just now, they're taking that away from the President into an offshore banking system that engineered the crisis we're now under.
[01:39:16.886 --> 01:39:28.373]  So, ladies and gentlemen, I'm just begging everybody out there listening to me to get angry, to get focused, to get upset, and to begin to discover the things I've discovered.
[01:39:29.093 --> 01:39:29.814]  I mean, it's not hard.
[01:39:29.834 --> 01:39:31.515]  You listen to local talk radio station.
[01:39:31.755 --> 01:39:33.256]  You're going to hear on the news about this.
[01:39:33.296 --> 01:39:34.536]  I mean, this stuff isn't hidden.
[01:39:35.877 --> 01:39:40.280]  This stuff is real, and it's true the CIA is trying to overthrow Iran right now.
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:43.882]  And they're going to go in there and blow that place to daylights if the public buys it.
[01:39:44.815 --> 01:39:47.657]  This is all a big show for you, and I don't like the moolahs.
[01:39:47.677 --> 01:39:52.980]  The point is, we are the most hated country on earth because criminals run this nation, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:54.061 --> 01:40:03.727]  And... The good news is Obama's approval rating has dropped from over 80% in the last four months to 58% and dropping, so people are getting wise to him.
[01:40:03.747 --> 01:40:06.569]  But by the time they get wise to him, they'll put some fake Republican in, and then...
[01:40:07.344 --> 01:40:10.085]  I'll go from being called a right-winger to being called a liberal.
[01:40:10.105 --> 01:40:11.826]  You know, when I'm bashing Bush, I'm a communist.
[01:40:12.166 --> 01:40:14.007]  And then when I'm bashing Obama, I'm a right-winger.
[01:40:14.287 --> 01:40:16.088]  No, I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:40:16.148 --> 01:40:17.328]  I'm a rule of law.
[01:40:17.748 --> 01:40:18.529]  I want liberty.
[01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:21.130]  I don't want to be overrun with bureaucratic thugs.
[01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:25.212]  I know the CPS is run by a bunch of pedophiles on average, stealing kids.
[01:40:25.672 --> 01:40:27.292]  I know they're doing it without due process.
[01:40:27.332 --> 01:40:30.494]  Folks, the crimes of this government, it isn't a government.
[01:40:30.534 --> 01:40:32.935]  It is a clearinghouse for criminals to rape us.
[01:40:33.215 --> 01:40:35.716]  Financially, physically, spiritually, psychologically.
[01:40:36.326 --> 01:40:41.630]  I got articles here where, in one year, 26% increase in Prozac use by the public.
[01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:44.392]  I mean, the public's all a bunch of drugged out, drooling zombies.
[01:40:44.612 --> 01:40:45.973]  The criminals are running wild.
[01:40:47.834 --> 01:40:50.296]  And anybody with half a brain's just trying to keep their head down.
[01:40:50.416 --> 01:40:51.196]  I mean, you know what?
[01:40:51.276 --> 01:40:53.598]  This is a recipe for disaster, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:54.839 --> 01:41:04.305]  And I told my wife today, I was sitting in the backyard with my children, and I said, and I'm not just saying this, I said, I've sworn to stay here and fight for this country, but I may get my family out of the country.
[01:41:04.445 --> 01:41:05.526]  I am two inches away.
[01:41:06.144 --> 01:41:18.190]  I'm two inches away and I'm sick of dealing with it and trying to hustle and get sponsors and fund the operation and get the word out just to have people say, oh, you just want to be a big shot.
[01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:19.631]  No, I want out of this, man.
[01:41:19.911 --> 01:41:21.092]  I wish this wasn't true.
[01:41:21.732 --> 01:41:29.596]  I have to go against my instincts and go against my own fleshly desires to just go live in a little house somewhere.
[01:41:29.616 --> 01:41:30.637]  That's what I like.
[01:41:31.497 --> 01:41:33.138]  And have lots of time off with my family.
[01:41:33.278 --> 01:41:35.099]  I am a regular guy.
[01:41:35.914 --> 01:41:46.019]  I'm just some aggressive, redneck, stock Texan who loves freedom and liberty, and I'm not a slave, and I know when a tyranny's coming down on me, and I'm not going along with it!
[01:41:46.159 --> 01:41:48.279]  And I don't know what's wrong with you people out there!
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:51.081]  You understand hardcore tyranny's taking over the country?
[01:41:51.601 --> 01:41:54.142]  I mean, it's so bad I can't even tell you how bad it is!
[01:41:54.362 --> 01:41:56.823]  It's so evil I can't even express how bad it is!
[01:41:59.825 --> 01:42:00.865]  Let's take a quick call here.
[01:42:00.885 --> 01:42:02.046]  Let's talk to Ruth in Florida.
[01:42:02.086 --> 01:42:02.766]  Ruth, you're on the air.
[01:42:04.537 --> 01:42:07.540]  I don't know what's wrong with everybody.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.322]  Well, they're drinking sodium fluoride.
[01:42:10.443 --> 01:42:11.344]  Yeah, probably.
[01:42:11.404 --> 01:42:13.286]  I did have a good little incident the other day.
[01:42:13.346 --> 01:42:14.708]  I love to have good signs.
[01:42:14.768 --> 01:42:24.439]  I work in a little donut shop and in the morning there's this little old lady, she's about 70 years old, comes in and gets donuts for her little push cart in the college over here.
[01:42:25.191 --> 01:42:30.294]  And as of next week, she's out of a job because they've decided they're going to bring a corporation in there and let them sell food.
[01:42:30.394 --> 01:42:33.236]  Oh yeah, why let a slave sell something on the street corner?
[01:42:33.556 --> 01:42:35.698]  Look, they're arresting Amish for selling eggs.
[01:42:35.878 --> 01:42:36.298]  I know.
[01:42:36.318 --> 01:42:38.419]  And SWAT teams are going to hit you and hit you hard.
[01:42:38.479 --> 01:42:38.960]  It's over.
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:44.503]  And the little strip that I work in, there's a little Job Corps office place that a lot of people show up there.
[01:42:44.523 --> 01:42:49.086]  Some of them are a little bit scary, but people looking for work, desperate for work.
[01:42:49.506 --> 01:42:51.988]  Well, you're not allowed to sell hot dogs or donuts anymore.
[01:42:52.008 --> 01:42:54.169]  If you don't like the SWAT teams, I'm going to kill you dead with a hammer.
[01:42:54.907 --> 01:42:55.187]  I know.
[01:42:55.247 --> 01:43:05.589]  Well, it turned out between myself and this nice little old lady and this young black man about 20, 30 something, you know, they started talking about the corporations and coming in.
[01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:11.290]  And I was almost, I was just getting tingly because it's so hard to find people that are willing to discuss this stuff.
[01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:15.451]  And here we were, you know, me, I'm 52, and then this nice little old lady.
[01:43:15.511 --> 01:43:18.791]  And I'll tell you what, tell me what they said when we get back.
[01:43:19.152 --> 01:43:19.992]  Hey, Ruth, Ruth, stay there.
[01:43:20.012 --> 01:43:21.072]  I want to hear what they say when we get back.
[01:43:21.112 --> 01:43:21.572]  Don't hang up.
[01:43:22.358 --> 01:43:22.759]  I got a break.
[01:43:22.779 --> 01:43:23.481]  We're going to go back to Ruth.
[01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:26.891]  We're going to go to John and a few others on the other side, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:33.547 --> 01:43:34.788]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:43:34.828 --> 01:43:40.190]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:45.032]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:43:45.452 --> 01:43:50.514]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:43:51.014 --> 01:43:55.716]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:43:56.236 --> 01:44:03.139]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:44:03.339 --> 01:44:04.240]  And here's the best part.
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:07.201]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:44:07.222 --> 01:44:10.824]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:44:11.144 --> 01:44:13.986]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:44:14.346 --> 01:44:16.227]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:44:16.568 --> 01:44:17.488]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:44:17.508 --> 01:44:17.868]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:44:17.888 --> 01:44:20.630]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:44:21.150 --> 01:44:22.872]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:44:35.345 --> 01:44:39.389]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.

[01:46:55.142 --> 01:46:57.423]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.

[01:47:24.748 --> 01:47:27.750]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[01:47:28.090 --> 01:47:29.470]  American Free Press.
[01:47:29.871 --> 01:47:32.532]  The voice of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:32.552 --> 01:47:35.693]  The GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:36.054 --> 01:47:38.955]  Providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:47:39.515 --> 01:47:40.256]  GCN.
[01:47:40.656 --> 01:47:42.617]  Great talk radio starts here.
[01:47:50.044 --> 01:47:51.325]  Okay, sorry Ruth.
[01:47:51.365 --> 01:47:53.225]  So you're in the donut shop.
[01:47:53.345 --> 01:47:55.926]  It's an old lady, isn't allowed to sell donuts on the street anymore.
[01:47:55.946 --> 01:47:58.126]  And a young black guy.
[01:47:58.146 --> 01:47:59.306]  You're in your donut shop.
[01:47:59.386 --> 01:48:01.227]  Okay, go ahead and finish your story.
[01:48:02.247 --> 01:48:06.468]  Nothing, it was just really thrilling that I could actually see that, you know, there was somebody out there.
[01:48:06.488 --> 01:48:10.009]  I'm not walking around alone trying to, you know, talk about this stuff.
[01:48:10.029 --> 01:48:11.629]  It was good to finally see somebody that
[01:48:12.468 --> 01:48:15.029]  Well, you noticed they were being hurt by it, though.
[01:48:15.069 --> 01:48:16.510]  That's why they knew about it.
[01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:17.270]  Exactly.
[01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:18.911]  Also, two more things.
[01:48:19.331 --> 01:48:20.892]  Saw a really good film last night.
[01:48:20.932 --> 01:48:23.273]  People want to see the CIA in action.
[01:48:23.793 --> 01:48:26.755]  Watched that one, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.
[01:48:26.775 --> 01:48:27.855]  That was really cool.
[01:48:28.276 --> 01:48:29.656]  You can see them putting it down.
[01:48:30.437 --> 01:48:33.698]  And another thing is, people shouldn't be saying they can't do nothing.
[01:48:33.738 --> 01:48:41.722]  I can't do a lot either, but I found this package of business cards I had bought one time, and I took them, and I took the Obama deception.
[01:48:42.247 --> 01:48:52.274]  I took the picture and shrunk it down real little and I had it typed in there, new boss, same as the old boss, Infowars.com, and I throw those things everywhere I go.
[01:48:53.615 --> 01:48:54.896]  Absolutely, God bless you Ruth.
[01:48:54.956 --> 01:49:03.463]  Listen folks, we have this Arnold Schwarzenegger archetypal Hercules image that this big hero has to do it all for you.
[01:49:04.444 --> 01:49:08.366]  And that if it isn't instant gratification against corruption, that we can't beat it.
[01:49:08.907 --> 01:49:11.669]  The corruption seeps in, we have to seep in against it.
[01:49:13.095 --> 01:49:15.617]  And, you know, spread the word about this radio show.
[01:49:15.657 --> 01:49:17.318]  Getting documentary films that are powerful.
[01:49:17.358 --> 01:49:19.980]  Making copies of Obama Deception, Endgame, Terror Storm.
[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:21.181]  My films are the most effective.
[01:49:21.522 --> 01:49:22.102]  Giving them out.
[01:49:22.202 --> 01:49:24.564]  Spreading free links to my films online to people.
[01:49:25.845 --> 01:49:27.506]  Starting a local access TV show.
[01:49:27.886 --> 01:49:29.187]  Starting a local radio show.
[01:49:29.207 --> 01:49:33.329]  A lot of towns you can get on Saturday or Sunday with a show and it'll become successful.
[01:49:33.349 --> 01:49:34.370]  You can maybe get a weekday show.
[01:49:34.710 --> 01:49:37.312]  Or volunteer to do local news for a local station.
[01:49:37.552 --> 01:49:40.073]  If you've had a history of that and, you know, come in.
[01:49:40.353 --> 01:49:45.236]  Now a lot of these stations will listen to you and let you do reports about the New World Order because it's out in the open now.
[01:49:45.677 --> 01:49:55.082]  You know, we've got to come together and decide this is mainstream and that foreign corporations are raping us and looting the nation and that we're not going to let this happen.
[01:49:55.387 --> 01:50:04.271]  I mean, I just read to you mainstream news where the Federal Reserve, no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, sees any business they want, any company, run everything.
[01:50:04.631 --> 01:50:06.772]  That is dictatorship of foreign banks.
[01:50:07.172 --> 01:50:11.394]  This is a new form of government where an offshore corporate bank controls the nation.
[01:50:11.434 --> 01:50:14.655]  That's worse than the classical colonialism where it was some empire.
[01:50:15.942 --> 01:50:18.183]  Because then these bankers claim there's no welfare.
[01:50:18.543 --> 01:50:24.646]  They claim that the state has, you know, no job to take care of people.
[01:50:24.666 --> 01:50:25.867]  They have no responsibility.
[01:50:25.907 --> 01:50:26.987]  They have no liability.
[01:50:27.027 --> 01:50:27.968]  It's all fraud.
[01:50:28.988 --> 01:50:29.789]  They rule us.
[01:50:29.869 --> 01:50:32.710]  They tax us at the point of a gun through the government.
[01:50:33.110 --> 01:50:36.092]  Offshore corporations coupling with government to control us.
[01:50:36.992 --> 01:50:38.093]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:50:38.133 --> 01:50:40.254]  And then the text of S.
[01:50:40.554 --> 01:50:42.895]  787 Clean Water Restoration Act, just Google text of
[01:50:43.971 --> 01:50:47.214]  Senate Bill, or just S, 787 Clean Water Act.
[01:50:48.255 --> 01:50:50.077]  And, uh, you can go read this for yourself.
[01:50:50.217 --> 01:50:50.898]  I mean, read it!
[01:50:51.558 --> 01:50:51.939]  Read it!
[01:50:52.539 --> 01:50:56.924]  Virginia State Police say anti-New World Order and gun rights activists are terrorists.
[01:50:56.984 --> 01:50:58.765]  CurtNemo, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:59.206 --> 01:51:02.289]  This story needs to go completely viral, just like we forced
[01:51:02.924 --> 01:51:05.045]  This, uh, you know, I went and read the bill Monday.
[01:51:05.326 --> 01:51:07.927]  They finally made public of the Federal Reserve takeover.
[01:51:07.987 --> 01:51:13.091]  I knew it was going to be a takeover, but not a complete, total, no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, no nothing.
[01:51:13.391 --> 01:51:23.077]  Everything's ruled by these bankers, but they can already steal $14.8 trillion in eight months since the bailout, and no one can investigate them, so why not just have total power?
[01:51:23.297 --> 01:51:24.938]  Hell, if they're getting away with that, why not?
[01:51:26.859 --> 01:51:29.101]  And then presidents will come and go, but they'll stay in power.
[01:51:30.922 --> 01:51:34.907]  With this story, Virginia State Police say anti-New World Order and gun rights activists are terrorists.
[01:51:35.067 --> 01:51:37.350]  This was posted on their website!
[01:51:38.011 --> 01:51:40.534]  One of our listeners said, look at the Virginia State Police website!
[01:51:40.834 --> 01:51:42.876]  You can go to their website and read this!
[01:51:43.417 --> 01:51:44.098]  They've gone from...
[01:51:44.722 --> 01:51:54.045]  Six months ago, this stuff being secret, and we'd break it and people wouldn't believe us, to just, yeah, all protesting is terrorism, all gun rights groups are evil, the Second Amendment's terrorism.
[01:51:54.065 --> 01:51:55.585]  I mean, it actually says it.
[01:51:55.825 --> 01:52:01.827]  And then this one, proposed law allows Attorney General Holder to block gun sales to over a million Americans, including veterans.
[01:52:02.087 --> 01:52:08.069]  They're just, if we, if they feel like it, no judge, no jury, no facing your accuser, you just can't own guns anymore.
[01:52:08.429 --> 01:52:13.110]  And they're saying that they're not only going to
[01:52:14.406 --> 01:52:17.248]  Come in and not let you buy guns.
[01:52:17.288 --> 01:52:18.728]  They're going to come and take them!
[01:52:19.769 --> 01:52:22.470]  Forget the 68 Gun Control Act where felons can't own guns.
[01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:23.871]  They just show up and take your guns.
[01:52:24.692 --> 01:52:25.772]  And they won't tell you why!
[01:52:25.792 --> 01:52:28.113]  I mean, this is total tyranny!
[01:52:28.414 --> 01:52:31.775]  And DOD training manual describes protests as low-level terrorism?
[01:52:32.416 --> 01:52:41.040]  This is a public DOD training manual that they teach all the new people in Army Security Forces and MPs that all protest is illegal.
[01:52:41.461 --> 01:52:43.682]  I mean, this is mainstream!
[01:52:45.922 --> 01:52:47.143]  I just, I can't handle it.
[01:52:47.223 --> 01:52:50.605]  I mean, it's just... Let's go back to your calls.
[01:52:50.645 --> 01:52:51.726]  John in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:52:51.746 --> 01:52:52.346]  Thanks for holding.
[01:52:53.027 --> 01:52:53.467]  Yes, sir.
[01:52:54.327 --> 01:53:01.432]  You know, the victories will start to be coming in, and thanks to you, you'll be riding the wave when these victories start coming in.
[01:53:01.632 --> 01:53:03.313]  Well, I'll probably get a bullet in my head.
[01:53:03.994 --> 01:53:04.754]  This is not fun.
[01:53:05.675 --> 01:53:08.036]  This is the most unbelievable thing in the St.
[01:53:08.076 --> 01:53:09.837]  Petersburg Times, Florida, St.
[01:53:09.858 --> 01:53:11.919]  Petersburg Times today, headline news.
[01:53:13.057 --> 01:53:15.139]  Uh, they brought down a CIA colony.
[01:53:15.759 --> 01:53:17.000]  They've been trying to bring them down.
[01:53:17.041 --> 01:53:18.962]  The Scientologists, their headquarters are here.
[01:53:19.242 --> 01:53:21.604]  Uh, they've infiltrated the Clearwater Police.
[01:53:21.644 --> 01:53:22.925]  They've shut down newspapers.
[01:53:23.946 --> 01:53:27.209]  Uh, as you know, their history, uh, is phenomenal.
[01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.770]  Absolutely.
[01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:29.671]  So what is it saying?
[01:53:30.631 --> 01:53:32.233]  Well, it's unbelievable.
[01:53:32.433 --> 01:53:35.275]  Uh, the guy that's ahead of the, they're bringing down the whole head.
[01:53:35.495 --> 01:53:36.976]  He's on the front page of the paper.
[01:53:37.016 --> 01:53:38.037]  They've never done this before.
[01:53:38.057 --> 01:53:38.918]  So what happened?
[01:53:39.779 --> 01:53:40.099]  Okay.
[01:53:41.039 --> 01:53:45.001]  The head of the Scientologist locked twelve board members in his room.
[01:53:45.021 --> 01:53:48.703]  They're exposing, there's like four board members came out.
[01:53:49.324 --> 01:53:51.985]  Said they were locked in there for two weeks with ten other members.
[01:53:52.725 --> 01:53:54.386]  They couldn't even leave on their own accord.
[01:53:54.927 --> 01:53:57.228]  This guy's been slapping people, punching them.
[01:53:58.769 --> 01:54:02.971]  The guy's called... I mean, is that Mark Cavage or is that one of the lawyers that runs it?
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:04.901]  No, it's Miss Cave.
[01:54:05.302 --> 01:54:08.065]  He started when he was in the 10th grade.
[01:54:08.105 --> 01:54:08.966]  He dropped out of school.
[01:54:08.986 --> 01:54:11.889]  He was Ron Hubbard's cabin boy on his yacht.
[01:54:11.969 --> 01:54:14.833]  And then he came and he's taken over, the complete thing over.
[01:54:15.433 --> 01:54:17.496]  And he's been running it now ever since Hubbard died.
[01:54:17.616 --> 01:54:21.180]  Well, I know Hubbard was tied in to Alistair Crowley and all that.
[01:54:22.450 --> 01:54:24.731]  Like the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and NASA.
[01:54:25.052 --> 01:54:27.874]  NASA was basically founded by Aleister Crowley and Nazis.
[01:54:28.074 --> 01:54:29.215]  That's mainstream.
[01:54:29.375 --> 01:54:29.996]  That's what I mean.
[01:54:30.056 --> 01:54:31.337]  Who can make this stuff up?
[01:54:31.637 --> 01:54:36.901]  What type of fruitcake country has Aleister Crowley and Nazis?
[01:54:38.442 --> 01:54:39.203]  I was on the set.
[01:54:40.044 --> 01:54:44.245]  of Ultimate Fighting Championship with ESPN, talking to Joe Rogan.
[01:54:44.665 --> 01:54:48.466]  And there's the head announcer, and I'm going, yeah, you know, Goddard Space Center, top Nazis.
[01:54:48.726 --> 01:54:53.168]  And the guy walked over and thought I was a liar, saying Nazis were at NASA.
[01:54:53.448 --> 01:54:55.588]  I mean, they just, the public doesn't know anything!
[01:54:56.208 --> 01:54:59.269]  And I'm not bashing that guy, it's just that they don't know.
[01:54:59.309 --> 01:55:01.990]  But anyways, what's the headline, and I'll try to cover it this week.
[01:55:03.641 --> 01:55:06.082]  Well, it's just bringing down the psychologists.
[01:55:06.102 --> 01:55:09.963]  I mean, they've got a three... I mean, what's the headline so I can read the article in the St.
[01:55:09.983 --> 01:55:11.744]  Petersburg newspaper?
[01:55:12.104 --> 01:55:13.244]  I think it's on the front page.
[01:55:13.325 --> 01:55:15.445]  I just read it on the computer, but it's on the front page.
[01:55:15.885 --> 01:55:17.786]  And they're having, like, a whole story.
[01:55:17.866 --> 01:55:20.287]  I mean, it's just... They're breaking this thing up.
[01:55:20.347 --> 01:55:22.328]  The guy is... They're going to sue them.
[01:55:22.808 --> 01:55:24.108]  They've never been brought this down before.
[01:55:24.128 --> 01:55:25.529]  They've taken over papers down here.
[01:55:25.549 --> 01:55:26.589]  They've tried to take them down.
[01:55:27.229 --> 01:55:27.529]  No, I know.
[01:55:27.549 --> 01:55:30.310]  They've been convicted for infiltrating the FBI and CIA.
[01:55:30.650 --> 01:55:31.070]  Thank you.
[01:55:31.151 --> 01:55:32.411]  Very interesting information.
[01:55:33.041 --> 01:55:33.701]  Just what I need.
[01:55:33.722 --> 01:55:36.623]  I'm taking on the whole New World Order, CIA, now the Scientologist.
[01:55:37.904 --> 01:55:39.425]  It's just getting crazy here.
[01:55:40.426 --> 01:55:41.927]  Let's talk to Arthur and Mass.
[01:55:42.567 --> 01:55:43.108]  You know what?
[01:55:43.168 --> 01:55:44.208]  Might as well just go all the way.
[01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.909]  You know what they say?
[01:55:44.929 --> 01:55:50.493]  I might as well just write my own obituary and then just get it over with and decide it's all in God's hands.
[01:55:50.713 --> 01:55:52.994]  I've already done that a long time ago, but I mean almost publicly.
[01:55:53.475 --> 01:55:57.297]  And just decide I'm already dead, put it all in God's hands, and that's just the way it is.
[01:55:57.357 --> 01:55:58.698]  I'm going all the way to the end.
[01:55:58.998 --> 01:55:59.759]  I'm doing my job.
[01:55:59.799 --> 01:56:01.000]  I'm standing up for what's right.
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:02.841]  And I'm not going to pull any punches.
[01:56:03.697 --> 01:56:04.798]  We're just going to tell it like it is.
[01:56:04.818 --> 01:56:06.619]  I'm going to live on my feet, not on my knees.
[01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:11.782]  And the more you would have that attitude, this evil would disappear like dreams at dawn.
[01:56:12.763 --> 01:56:13.924]  Like phantoms at dawn.
[01:56:14.564 --> 01:56:15.665]  Let's talk to Arthur.
[01:56:15.705 --> 01:56:16.766]  All we have time for calls.
[01:56:16.846 --> 01:56:17.426]  Arthur in mask.
[01:56:17.446 --> 01:56:17.806]  Go ahead.
[01:56:18.367 --> 01:56:19.107]  Hello, Alex.
[01:56:19.307 --> 01:56:19.748]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:19.848 --> 01:56:20.368]  Got two minutes.
[01:56:20.408 --> 01:56:20.748]  Go for it.
[01:56:21.929 --> 01:56:22.990]  Hey, good to speak with you.
[01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:26.072]  I've been trying to contact you about two and a half, three years.
[01:56:26.192 --> 01:56:30.295]  I did a original research proposal on
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:33.761]  Uh, fluoride implication on osteoporosis.
[01:56:34.081 --> 01:56:35.241]  Oh, that's an admitted fact.
[01:56:35.301 --> 01:56:36.502]  I have all the big government reports.
[01:56:36.522 --> 01:56:37.462]  That's why they put it in the water.
[01:56:38.582 --> 01:56:41.943]  And, you know, if I listen to the talk, probably three or four times.
[01:56:42.264 --> 01:56:46.765]  By the way, folks, just don't believe these phony doctors on the radios who say there's no evidence sodium fluoride's bad.
[01:56:46.805 --> 01:56:50.626]  Just Google fluoridation of water bone cancer.
[01:56:50.666 --> 01:56:52.667]  You will see thousands of government reports.
[01:56:52.987 --> 01:56:54.567]  It is an admitted fact.
[01:56:54.788 --> 01:56:56.268]  It gives you bone cancer.
[01:56:56.848 --> 01:56:57.248]  Go ahead.
[01:56:57.348 --> 01:56:59.129]  One of the biggest points, uh,
[01:57:00.804 --> 01:57:03.026]  You probably missed, because it's so corrupt.
[01:57:03.066 --> 01:57:05.368]  And this has been going on since the early 1900s.
[01:57:05.988 --> 01:57:07.389]  And it's always been covered up.
[01:57:07.489 --> 01:57:11.392]  Hundreds of degenerative bone and skeletal problems.
[01:57:11.532 --> 01:57:12.993]  It's completely obvious.
[01:57:13.513 --> 01:57:22.900]  And it's like, it's still, Paul Kauder has been doing a battle, day to day, week to week, to get fluoridation out of our, get the fluoride out of our water.
[01:57:23.020 --> 01:57:26.283]  Well, we got a tour of the Austin water this week, and the people there didn't like it.
[01:57:26.303 --> 01:57:29.265]  And they said, we know, we know it's bad, we don't like it, but don't quote us.
[01:57:29.813 --> 01:57:30.713]  Yeah, we know this is bad.
[01:57:30.733 --> 01:57:31.494]  They're not stupid.
[01:57:31.514 --> 01:57:34.815]  They gotta wear chemical weapon suits when they put it in the water.
[01:57:34.835 --> 01:57:43.639]  Yeah, even in Assault Mask, they came up and they shot it down to keep the fluoridation going.
[01:57:43.699 --> 01:57:45.199]  Assault Mask, one of the highest
[01:57:47.816 --> 01:57:48.556]  And you know what's sick?
[01:57:48.596 --> 01:57:51.717]  This is the by-product of aluminum manufacturing, mainly.
[01:57:52.017 --> 01:57:58.819]  It's also radioactive because it's those type of rocks that they get the chemicals for fertilizer out of that also where they mine uranium.
[01:57:58.839 --> 01:58:01.980]  It's got waste, it's got lead, it's got cadmium.
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:02.921]  Oh, I know, exactly.
[01:58:03.361 --> 01:58:06.141]  When you hear fluoride, it's a cover for arsenic, everything.
[01:58:06.161 --> 01:58:06.782]  You don't believe me?
[01:58:06.822 --> 01:58:08.762]  Go call Austin if you live in Austin or other cities.
[01:58:08.982 --> 01:58:10.863]  They'll go, yeah, we're hitting you hard with chemical weapons.
[01:58:11.183 --> 01:58:11.803]  Hope you like it.
[01:58:12.003 --> 01:58:13.444]  Hope you enjoy getting brain cancer.
[01:58:14.924 --> 01:58:15.546]  Out of time.
[01:58:15.907 --> 01:58:20.456]  Back live this week, 11 to 3 there in the week at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:20.676 --> 01:58:21.518]  Great job, crew!

[01:58:53.180 --> 01:59:02.466]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:59:02.526 --> 01:59:03.247]  This capitalism?
[01:59:03.307 --> 01:59:09.451]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:59:09.591 --> 01:59:10.352]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:59:10.372 --> 01:59:13.494]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
