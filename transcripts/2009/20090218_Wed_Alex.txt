[00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:05.332]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.993 --> 00:00:07.034]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:08.855]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:10.316]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.096 --> 00:00:11.957]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:16.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.903]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.867]  We are back live.
[00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:27.048]  We have an hour and 52 minutes left in worldwide transmission.
[00:00:27.088 --> 00:00:29.850]  We just began simulcasting here in the last two hours.
[00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.873]  Not just on radio, but now on TV online at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:34.913 --> 00:00:36.153]  Thank you for watching us live.
[00:00:36.173 --> 00:00:40.916]  We also archive it for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers at PrisonPlanet.TV each day.
[00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:43.958]  I want to thank the great crew that is here doing things.
[00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:45.918]  Running the show for us.
[00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.460]  We're going to go to Pastor Lindsey Williams in just one moment.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.362]  But first, I want to thank one of our sponsors, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:58.264]  Fabulous heirloom, non-GMO, non-hybrid seeds.
[00:00:59.484 --> 00:01:00.685]  We're in uncertain times.
[00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:01.825]  You know, we had 90% of the public
[00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:05.763]  Right at about 90%.
[00:01:05.863 --> 00:01:07.185]  I looked it up the other day again.
[00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:16.961]  It was about 89% living in rural areas during the Great Depression and still 7 million, according to government studies, starved to death during the 10-year depression.
[00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:21.900]  We're now 90% urban, not rural.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.005]  We live in the cities, 90%, and only half of the 10% that is rural are self-sufficient.
[00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:29.786]  So, 5% of the U.S.
[00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:31.088]  population is self-sufficient.
[00:01:31.688 --> 00:01:32.549]  It's fun to garden.
[00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:33.410]  It's great to garden.
[00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.450]  You need to start doing it.
[00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:35.531]  All of us need to get back.
[00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:40.896]  This is true local sustainability, not the globalist sustainability that they push that means feudalism.
[00:01:42.137 --> 00:01:42.757]  In control.
[00:01:42.817 --> 00:01:45.399]  So survivalseedbank.com.
[00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.980]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:52.583]  High quality heirloom non-GMO seeds.
[00:01:52.623 --> 00:01:53.764]  Give them a call at 877-327-0365.

[00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.452]  That said, let's go ahead now and tell you about our next guest.
[00:02:09.472 --> 00:02:13.615]  You know, I've had Lindsey on over the years, on average about twice a year.
[00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:20.501]  I've been interviewing Mr. Williams, I know, for at least 12 years, most of my career on radio.
[00:02:22.022 --> 00:02:29.608]  And I've always known him to bring out very accurate information, not just because I've read part of it later in the news or learned about it from a separate guest.
[00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:46.758]  But because I live in Texas, and much of my family on both sides worked as roughnecks in the oil fields, and lease hounds, and in refineries, and as petroleum geologists, and
[00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:53.137]  So I have studied the situation, and I know that we have an overabundance of oil.
[00:02:53.797 --> 00:03:05.599]  I know that it's even leaked out in mainstream news years after he talked about it, that there is more oil in Alaska, very easily extractable, discovered oil, and there's oil in the Gulf of Mexico that they've laid off limits.
[00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.440]  They let the Chinese and others and the Mexican government have it, but we can't.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.521]  More oil than Saudi Arabia, and those fines are on record, and we've gone over those on air before.
[00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:26.043]  But he, with Atlantic Richfield, he was a pastor up there, and this happens more often than not, working in the oil field, saving them a lot of money, keeping them from blowing their money, getting drunk, going to prostitutes.
[00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:35.229]  And so they hired him for three years to be the Atlantic Richfield, but also with other oil companies, on their board meetings to pray and to be their chaplain.
[00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:37.531]  A lot of companies do that.
[00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:43.494]  And so he wrote best-selling books about the subject and exposed how they staged the
[00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.813]  The oil shortage in the 70s, both times.
[00:03:48.614 --> 00:03:57.402]  But then, back in July, I got a call from Dr. Stan Monteith, and he said it was very important, so I called him, and he said, look, I can't talk about this yet.
[00:03:57.802 --> 00:04:06.130]  There's somebody that we both know who's got some powerful information about what they're going to do with oil prices, but as soon as he's ready to go public, I'll interview him first, and then you can talk to him.
[00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:20.603]  So, Dr. Monteith interviewed him, and then we had him on a few days after, there in July, when oil was at, depending on what day it was in that week when I had him on, between $147 and $149 a barrel.
[00:04:20.623 --> 00:04:25.266]  Now, it went down last week to $134, and it's right at that point right now.
[00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:28.808]  Fat guys, check crude oil prices.
[00:04:28.848 --> 00:04:32.670]  Google that and pull up me a CNBC chart on crude oil prices.
[00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.452]  I want to just check what it is today, because a few days ago it was $34, but I want to check that.
[00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:47.435]  And this fit into all my other research and all the other, you know, former, you know, heads of policy, department of treasury, and just all the Nobel Prize winners in economics we've had on.
[00:04:47.915 --> 00:04:49.756]  The globalists create all this fiat money.
[00:04:50.276 --> 00:04:57.859]  They buy up the world with it, they get everybody into a debt-based fiat economy, and then as soon as we went to the point of being a negative debt nation,
[00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:03.479]  They were going to pull the plug, and we also got that from two different Bilderberg sources in June of 2006.
[00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:11.320]  On record, Daniel Estlin on this show, Jim Tucker on this show, and the video at the hotel down the street from Bilderberg.
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.661]  Okay, what did your sources say?
[00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:16.221]  Okay, two Bilderberg members that are leaking us info.
[00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:17.622]  I mean, this is cat and mouse.
[00:05:17.642 --> 00:05:21.402]  This is being followed down alleys and, you know, guys in black sedans following you.
[00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:22.242]  It's all an endgame.
[00:05:22.282 --> 00:05:24.403]  I mean, literally being followed around like in a
[00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:34.396]  Well, this video out of Istanbul, Turkey, looks like something from Raiders of the Lost Ark, where they're going through those bazaars and people are following them, just trying to meet with somebody.
[00:05:34.436 --> 00:05:42.359]  And then, you know, literally you meet with a Bilderberg group member or their secretary, and then they tell you, you know, OK, I'm going out the back of this door.
[00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:43.180]  This is what they're planning.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.340]  See ya!
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.342]  I mean, this is the type of stuff we go through to bring you this information.
[00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:54.025]  And it's almost like pearls before swine.
[00:05:54.826 --> 00:05:56.366]  I mean, everything we talk about comes true.
[00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:57.687]  Everything we talk about is accurate.
[00:05:58.288 --> 00:06:10.335]  We said, almost three years ago, it's what, two years and nine months ago, that they would pop the subprime mortgage, but first they were going to drive oil up to $150,000.
[00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:13.256]  It was like $65,000 then.
[00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:14.077]  That sounded crazy.
[00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:15.678]  That was already an all-time record.
[00:06:15.698 --> 00:06:15.678]  $65,000.
[00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:17.019]  $67,000 to be exact.
[00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:21.176]  That sounded crazy.
[00:06:21.217 --> 00:06:28.160]  Daniel Estlin said from Bilderberg sources that they were going to suck everybody back into the stock market, run it back up to $13,000, exactly what happened.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:35.924]  Then they would pop the subprime mortgage by name, directly from Bilderberg, and then everything would implode.
[00:06:38.945 --> 00:06:46.329]  Then I remember talking to Estlin after Turkey, and he got so many threats and so much stuff went on.
[00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.170]  Notice you don't hear it from Daniel Estlin anymore.
[00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:51.377]  They tried to kill him again.
[00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:52.878]  He won't come on air.
[00:06:53.118 --> 00:06:54.318]  Daniel Esselstyn's gone, folks.
[00:06:54.358 --> 00:06:55.238]  He doesn't do radio anymore.
[00:06:55.258 --> 00:06:55.878]  Have you noticed that?
[00:06:56.258 --> 00:06:57.498]  Maybe we can coax him back on.
[00:06:57.538 --> 00:06:58.919]  But this gets to people that have children.
[00:06:58.939 --> 00:06:59.639]  He has children now.
[00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.160]  With me, when they threaten my family, I just have to say, God, it's in your hands.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.660]  I commit.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.540]  I commit.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.220]  We're about to go to Lindsey.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.621]  I just want to preface all of this.
[00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:15.142]  Lindsey comes on here when oil is $147 plus a barrel, and he says within six months it'll be below $50.
[00:07:17.114 --> 00:07:21.695]  No one could have imagined that, but it came directly from top oil exec.
[00:07:23.796 --> 00:07:25.636]  And it's on record that Lindsey worked for these people.
[00:07:26.617 --> 00:07:32.638]  Now, right after the time Lindsey told me this, I have family in East Texas and in Houston who are all in oil.
[00:07:34.619 --> 00:07:42.381]  And we've been waiting with bated breath with some family land we got, because the gas wells and oil wells never get built down towards where our property's at.
[00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:44.242]  We're always, wow, that'd be great if that ever happened to us.
[00:07:44.762 --> 00:07:45.562]  And it stopped.
[00:07:47.205 --> 00:08:05.449]  Now they're back running around, but the whole point is, is that the inside scoop from oil companies was, and I even had dinner one time at my dad's house, and there was an oil company owner, one of the thousands of small ones, who was there and he was saying, and this is about six months ago, that yeah, they're planning to drop the price.
[00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:13.690]  So this is after Lindsey tells me this, I start putting feelers out in the kind of mid-level, because I mean, oil is the biggest industry here in Texas.
[00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.971]  Bigger than telecommunications, bigger than computers.
[00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:18.764]  So it's all over the place.
[00:08:19.084 --> 00:08:21.665]  And so I said, there's a lot of credence to that, but it wasn't dropping yet.
[00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:23.706]  Then it starts dropping now down to $134 a barrel.
[00:08:23.726 --> 00:08:24.847]  And crude oil today is $33.55 a barrel.
[00:08:24.867 --> 00:08:25.967]  Unbelievable.
[00:08:25.987 --> 00:08:31.690]  We're on, in fact, punch that up.
[00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.192]  He just showed me one of the indexes off the mercantile and it said $33.
[00:08:46.773 --> 00:08:50.635]  New York Mexican crude is at $0.35 and 1 cent.
[00:08:52.296 --> 00:08:54.358]  ComEx Gold is at $9.79.
[00:08:54.878 --> 00:08:58.961]  It's just surging, what, more than $15 today.
[00:08:59.321 --> 00:09:00.442]  But anyway, side issue.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:14.065]  You better listen to what Lindsey's saying, because everything he said made perfect sense with all the other data I had, then it fell in place, and then he was proven right, which is scary, because they plan to bankrupt the Arabs, bankrupt the world.
[00:09:14.465 --> 00:09:19.347]  In fact, I left it out there, guys, that New York Times about Mumbai totally imploding.
[00:09:19.367 --> 00:09:20.728]  It was on top of the printer last night.
[00:09:20.968 --> 00:09:22.128]  I meant to have it for today's show.
[00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.329]  I print stuff for research and then don't get it in there.
[00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.492]  It was the one about Dubai totally imploding and everybody losing their jobs.
[00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:37.299]  Everything he's saying is coming true for a worldwide depression where all that's left is the bankers and their control.
[00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:44.882]  So you better listen to Lindsey Williams because what he's saying is exactly what they're doing, destroying the entire world economy by design.
[00:09:45.282 --> 00:09:53.926]  When we went over the line in January of 2007 and America became a negative economy, that is, more debt than we had
[00:09:56.986 --> 00:09:58.087]  Investments are profits.
[00:09:58.127 --> 00:09:59.008]  We are a debtor nation.
[00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:00.489]  That's when the bankers pulled the plug.
[00:10:00.749 --> 00:10:02.531]  That's when it was time to blow the Ponzi scheme.
[00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:10.197]  But unlike regular Ponzi schemes where the made-off or whatever runs off of the money, in this one they implode the Ponzi scheme and get the whole world.
[00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:12.719]  Now that's a long introduction, but I wanted to back up.
[00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:15.721]  Lindsey Williams will be with us until about 40 after in the next hour.
[00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:17.943]  Pastor Williams, great to have you here.
[00:10:19.044 --> 00:10:22.487]  Thank you, Alex, for allowing me to be with you today on InfoWars.
[00:10:25.006 --> 00:10:29.749]  Three years time I had the privilege, by the providence of God, of living with the elite.
[00:10:30.209 --> 00:10:36.232]  For the past 35 years, just as you have just stated, everything that I say has come directly from them.
[00:10:36.893 --> 00:10:47.558]  Then came the opportunity of a lifetime when I actually talked with a gentleman I had not seen for 25 years just a few months ago, and he told me everything that was going to happen.
[00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:52.181]  Everything that the elite had planned for the world for the next year to a year and a half.
[00:10:52.964 --> 00:11:03.093]  And that's all I have done for the past 35 years is voice what I have heard the elite say because of the privilege that I have of living with them for three years' time.
[00:11:03.153 --> 00:11:08.699]  Now, since the program last week, Alex, I've done this especially for your program today.
[00:11:08.719 --> 00:11:16.586]  I have investigated and looked world over for what's happening worldwide in order to put together what this man told me.
[00:11:17.253 --> 00:11:20.595]  Into a global picture.
[00:11:41.564 --> 00:11:42.705]  Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:43.465]  Just amazing.
[00:11:44.146 --> 00:11:46.308]  And we're going to be taking your calls coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:11:46.808 --> 00:11:47.909]  For the rest of the time, he's with us.
[00:11:47.929 --> 00:11:49.870]  I want you to be able to address your questions to Lindsey Williams.
[00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.573]  I know we already had folks holding, but it's all on the same subject.
[00:11:53.593 --> 00:11:54.314]  The New World Order.
[00:11:55.134 --> 00:11:55.595]  Stay with us.
[00:12:00.038 --> 00:12:06.443]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:12:06.803 --> 00:12:08.465]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.441]  But who is the enemy?
[00:12:10.982 --> 00:12:11.482]  Bin Laden.
[00:12:11.782 --> 00:12:12.743]  This is his MO.
[00:12:12.763 --> 00:12:14.065]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:15.767]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:12:16.127 --> 00:12:22.894]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:12:23.294 --> 00:12:23.735]  Some U.S.
[00:12:23.775 --> 00:12:29.421]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:33.603]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:12:33.623 --> 00:12:36.405]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.

[00:13:37.995 --> 00:13:38.255]  I think so.
[00:13:59.912 --> 00:14:00.452]  You worry.
[00:14:00.813 --> 00:14:02.534]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:14:02.894 --> 00:14:05.116]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.

[00:14:12.862 --> 00:14:17.726]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:14:18.106 --> 00:14:21.429]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:23.410]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.372]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:14:26.673 --> 00:14:29.615]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.

[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:13.822]  Alright, I gave you quite a bit of the background of Lindsey Williams and what this top oil company executive that he's known for many years called him and told him, threatened him.
[00:16:16.543 --> 00:16:20.604]  Telling him, look Lindsey, you made that video that tens of millions have seen for free on Google Video.
[00:16:20.624 --> 00:16:23.624]  We want that offline or something bad is going to happen to you.
[00:16:24.325 --> 00:16:25.785]  But you can tell people this.
[00:16:26.974 --> 00:16:30.216]  We're going to bankrupt the world, and there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:16:30.616 --> 00:16:32.457]  And Lindsey, you ought to get out of the U.S.
[00:16:33.518 --> 00:16:35.819]  All right, Lindsey, everything you said is coming true.
[00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:38.460]  As the globalists bankrupt the planet, please continue.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:51.347]  Well, Alex, there positively is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world, and there's only one power in the universe who is able to overcome them, and that's divine.
[00:16:51.808 --> 00:16:55.830]  Unless God steps in, there positively is no way to stop these people.
[00:16:56.394 --> 00:16:57.895]  I lived with them for three years.
[00:16:58.356 --> 00:16:59.156]  I know many of them.
[00:16:59.256 --> 00:16:59.977]  I know who they are.
[00:17:00.678 --> 00:17:09.244]  They told me back just a few months ago, and Alex, you allowed me the privilege of telling something so phenomenal that the world couldn't possibly believe it.
[00:17:09.705 --> 00:17:11.406]  It was impossible for it to happen.
[00:17:11.807 --> 00:17:18.412]  It would devastate the world's economy if it took place, and you allowed me on July the 28th to tell on your program
[00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:26.464]  That I had been told by an individual who knows everything that the elite have planned on the face of this earth for the next year to a year and a half.
[00:17:26.824 --> 00:17:31.908]  And Alex, I'm so appreciative that you would even allow me to tell such outlandish things because
[00:17:32.423 --> 00:17:34.465]  There's no way in this world that it could have taken place.
[00:17:34.525 --> 00:17:50.658]  Well, Lindsey, I've known you for years, and I've also known for years Dr. Monteith since the mid-90s, so I knew that you at least were told this, and I knew everything you talked about in the past had been accurate, and we got laughed at, I got laughed at, you got laughed at, but they're not laughing now.
[00:17:51.979 --> 00:17:57.764]  They told me that the price of crude oil was going from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel.
[00:17:58.304 --> 00:17:59.565]  I said, why are you doing this?
[00:17:59.966 --> 00:18:01.527]  They said, we're going to bankrupt
[00:18:02.023 --> 00:18:04.345]  OPEC, the oil producing countries of the world.
[00:18:05.025 --> 00:18:05.806]  I got laughed at.
[00:18:05.946 --> 00:18:07.046]  You're exactly right.
[00:18:07.327 --> 00:18:12.810]  There's no way that the Arabs and OPEC and the oil producing countries could declare bankruptcy.
[00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:20.155]  They said, and this is yet to take place, you'll watch this play out over the next year's time, Alex, because right now this is not true.
[00:18:20.655 --> 00:18:23.757]  Great Russia will become a great power.
[00:18:24.258 --> 00:18:25.759]  And they told me that was going to happen.
[00:18:25.779 --> 00:18:26.779]  That hasn't happened yet.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.701]  I asked him about Dubai.
[00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:30.722]  He said it's going to become a ghost town.
[00:18:31.297 --> 00:18:40.565]  Now, in light of all of these things, let me point out, worldwide, globally, how this is playing out in their hands right now.
[00:18:40.885 --> 00:18:46.230]  For instance, yesterday, Russia closed their currency market in stock exchange.
[00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:47.511]  They had to close it down.
[00:18:47.571 --> 00:18:49.292]  It was literally going through the floor.
[00:18:49.793 --> 00:18:50.833]  Now let's look at China.
[00:18:51.934 --> 00:18:54.376]  70,000 Chinese factories have closed.
[00:18:54.537 --> 00:18:55.698]  Oh, this is devastating.
[00:18:55.898 --> 00:18:59.681]  Folks, you don't realize how this is going to affect our economy.
[00:19:00.057 --> 00:19:08.666]  In the next six to nine months' time, there are 28 to 30 million Chinese workers that are out of work, and many of them are already beginning to riot.
[00:19:09.127 --> 00:19:13.031]  Can you imagine the shivs in Walmart without anything made from China?
[00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:16.314]  Folks, this is so catastrophic.
[00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:21.179]  You see, I gathered this when this gentleman told me this a few months ago.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.781]  I could see forward
[00:19:23.237 --> 00:19:26.020]  As to what the outcome of all of this was going to be.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.161]  Now let's look at Japan.
[00:19:27.502 --> 00:19:28.783]  It's affecting them also.
[00:19:28.843 --> 00:19:35.290]  This is a world wide total control manipulation on the part of the elite.
[00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.613]  And they have planned it for months and years in advance.
[00:19:38.693 --> 00:19:42.056]  And you said they were also going to announce huge oil fines.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.061]  Oh yes they do.
[00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:47.723]  They're human beings just like you and I, Alex.
[00:19:47.743 --> 00:19:49.144]  Put on their breeches every morning just like we do.
[00:20:09.383 --> 00:20:15.365]  The only thing is, they have power from their God, and believe you me, it's not the same God you and I have, Alex.
[00:20:15.725 --> 00:20:18.206]  So now let's look further at what's happening around the world.
[00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:23.007]  Japan, Toyota sales dropped 25% last quarter.
[00:20:23.508 --> 00:20:27.449]  Japan GDP, gross domestic product, dropped 12.5%.
[00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.851]  Now let's look at Dubai, that world-class, five-star city.
[00:20:34.292 --> 00:20:36.933]  But the only reason I knew it, Alex, is because I was told if I want to be elite.
[00:20:36.953 --> 00:20:38.173]  I had no way in this world of being a little
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.463]  Preacher out here, missionary in Alaska, of ever knowing these things.
[00:21:05.563 --> 00:21:15.392]  It had to have been the providence of God that he allowed me to know them so I could tell the world and get on programs like yours and warn people that this is the plan of the elite.
[00:21:15.452 --> 00:21:17.573]  And he said to me, he said, Dubai.
[00:21:17.714 --> 00:21:18.654]  Oh, he just laughed.
[00:21:18.714 --> 00:21:20.216]  And he said, it's going to be a ghost town.
[00:21:20.556 --> 00:21:26.341]  I said, the biggest city, the most immaculate, the finest ever been built on the face of the earth.
[00:21:26.361 --> 00:21:27.622]  Okay, here it is right here.
[00:21:28.072 --> 00:21:37.356]  They just said, as of yesterday, 3,000 automobiles are sitting on the airport parking lot in Dubai, abandoned.
[00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:38.177]  Stay there!
[00:21:38.977 --> 00:21:39.357]  Stay there!
[00:21:39.397 --> 00:21:40.678]  Long segment coming up, Lindsey.
[00:21:41.098 --> 00:21:45.040]  Only in time to break all this down and then take phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.860]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.142]  My website's yourprisonplanet.com, infowars.com.
[00:21:50.202 --> 00:21:51.102]  We're on the march.
[00:21:51.603 --> 00:21:53.203]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.124 --> 00:21:56.805]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:59.969 --> 00:22:02.991]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:22:03.431 --> 00:22:06.734]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:22:07.214 --> 00:22:13.158]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:22:13.518 --> 00:22:17.661]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:22:18.161 --> 00:22:23.885]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:22:24.185 --> 00:22:27.187]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:22:29.949 --> 00:22:30.289]  I think so.
[00:23:00.902 --> 00:23:04.405]  Attention please, I've come with a message of information.
[00:23:04.425 --> 00:23:07.007]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:23:07.067 --> 00:23:08.228]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:08.248 --> 00:23:09.869]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:09.949 --> 00:23:12.431]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:23:12.631 --> 00:23:16.494]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[00:23:26.134 --> 00:23:31.013]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:36.137]  How dare you?
[00:23:37.419 --> 00:23:42.283]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:42.303 --> 00:23:44.926]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:45.026 --> 00:23:51.612]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rises.

[00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:03.310]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.

[00:25:07.059 --> 00:25:10.201]  You know, I want to apologize that I keep interrupting Lindsey so much.
[00:25:10.401 --> 00:25:30.692]  It's that when you know Bilderberg planned this, Kings and Queens and Rothschilds and Rockefellers meeting, and you go there, you get the death threats, you get arrested, and you get the information, and then you get it from Lindsey Williams, and you know it's real, you know it's happening, you know they've orchestrated this worldwide crisis, they admit it in their own documents.
[00:25:32.233 --> 00:25:33.855]  I just want to back up everything he's saying.
[00:25:34.355 --> 00:25:37.739]  I remember him talking about Dubai was going to be a ghost town back in July.
[00:25:37.759 --> 00:25:39.201]  How many months ago?
[00:25:39.781 --> 00:25:42.905]  August, September, November, December, January.
[00:25:43.445 --> 00:25:44.827]  We're talking six plus months ago.
[00:25:45.648 --> 00:25:47.430]  And it was up at that high when he said it.
[00:25:48.888 --> 00:25:51.509]  And I go back to what the sources at Bilderberg said.
[00:25:51.949 --> 00:25:53.329]  They were going to run it up to 150.
[00:25:53.369 --> 00:25:55.570]  That was insane when that was said, but it happened.
[00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.930]  We have the inside track.
[00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.811]  We put out the accurate info.
[00:26:00.231 --> 00:26:02.891]  And we have ways to defeat the globalists through states' rights.
[00:26:03.311 --> 00:26:04.832]  But it's up to you to take action with it.
[00:26:04.852 --> 00:26:17.995]  Now, Lindsey, I'm going to give you the floor, and I want you to again walk through, recap everything you were just saying, without me interrupting, and then get into the latest info, because you talked to him for hours on the phone, but
[00:26:18.874 --> 00:26:19.614]  That's how it works.
[00:26:20.275 --> 00:26:29.558]  You laid out what he told you, and that story's the same, but as things happen, you get more and more of the picture, because now it makes even more sense what he told you.
[00:26:29.939 --> 00:26:31.599]  So, you've got the floor.
[00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:32.320]  Continue.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.221]  This is all planned by the elite.
[00:26:35.581 --> 00:26:45.165]  Let me assure everyone out there in Alex Jones' audience, in InfoWars, folks, everything you are hearing Alex Jones say is true.
[00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:48.011]  Believe every word you hear every day.
[00:26:48.171 --> 00:26:50.293]  It may sound unbelievable.
[00:26:50.754 --> 00:26:51.935]  It is believable.
[00:26:52.455 --> 00:26:54.797]  I lived with these people for three years.
[00:26:55.378 --> 00:26:56.719]  I know they have it planned.
[00:26:56.899 --> 00:26:58.121]  Now let's go back to Dubai.
[00:26:58.641 --> 00:27:00.903]  Dubai is one of the Arab oil producing countries.
[00:27:01.404 --> 00:27:10.472]  This man told me when Dubai was at its glory, building a five-star city such as nothing has ever been built before on the face of the earth, the tallest skyscrapers in the world,
[00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:16.053]  And he said to me, Chaplain Williams, one of the reasons we're taking the price of crude oil to $50 a barrel.
[00:27:16.973 --> 00:27:19.375]  And by the way, crude oil yesterday was $33.80.
[00:27:19.475 --> 00:27:24.918]  They have gone way below what this man told me they were going to take it to.
[00:27:25.378 --> 00:27:29.601]  And because of this, it has had catastrophic results around the world.
[00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:32.663]  Dubai, building this beautiful five-star city.
[00:27:33.023 --> 00:27:38.726]  And workers have come from all over the world to Dubai to be construction workers in that city.
[00:27:39.106 --> 00:27:40.227]  Now, it's a ghost town.
[00:27:40.822 --> 00:27:42.103]  The skyscrapers have stopped.
[00:27:42.403 --> 00:27:48.126]  The concrete contract with the American Concrete Company has been cancelled because Dubai is out of money.
[00:27:48.506 --> 00:27:56.370]  And as a result of this, in Dubai, let's say first that you're a worker, and you go over and while you're there, ah, I want a new Mercedes.
[00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:57.691]  Oh, I'm making big money.
[00:27:58.711 --> 00:27:59.752]  I'd like a Rolls Royce.
[00:28:00.032 --> 00:28:01.613]  So you go and buy it on credit.
[00:28:01.973 --> 00:28:03.234]  And you can do that in Dubai.
[00:28:03.574 --> 00:28:04.614]  Well, that's fine.
[00:28:04.974 --> 00:28:08.316]  Except that if you don't make your payment, they don't do like they do in America.
[00:28:08.536 --> 00:28:09.837]  They're not going to forgive you a loan.
[00:28:10.236 --> 00:28:13.920]  They're not going to give you a bailout package like happened yesterday by our president.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:14.760]  No, no.
[00:28:15.161 --> 00:28:19.145]  In Dubai, they not only come and get the automobile, they come and get you.
[00:28:19.685 --> 00:28:23.429]  You go to prison along with the automobile being confiscated.
[00:28:23.589 --> 00:28:26.712]  As a result, these workers have lost their jobs by the thousands.
[00:28:27.236 --> 00:28:41.929]  There are sitting on the airport right now in the parking lot in Dubai City, 3,000 automobiles that workers left parked, left the keys in them, got on the airplane and left so that they wouldn't lose both their hide and the automobile.
[00:28:42.369 --> 00:28:51.517]  And as a result, Dubai City has said, has done everything that this individual told me back five months ago, six months ago was going to happen.
[00:28:51.858 --> 00:28:53.879]  It has become a ghost town.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.340]  You see,
[00:28:54.747 --> 00:28:59.929]  They have planned this thing worldwide in order to do what they wish to accomplish.
[00:28:59.969 --> 00:29:05.452]  Now let me tell you what's going to happen in America and point out what is happening right today.
[00:29:05.472 --> 00:29:06.453]  Now folks, watch this.
[00:29:06.473 --> 00:29:09.174]  I hope you have pencil and paper and you're taking notes.
[00:29:09.254 --> 00:29:16.797]  This man said to me, this person who knows everything, 82 years of age, he knows everything the elite are doing.
[00:29:17.438 --> 00:29:22.300]  He said to me, after I'd been threatened and I agreed to go along with what he said,
[00:29:22.717 --> 00:29:32.463]  And there's certain things I couldn't even say on the Alex Jones Show today in order to keep the sanity of my household and my family and keep myself in keeping their word.
[00:29:32.703 --> 00:29:36.825]  He said to me, he said, Lindsey, he called me chaplain.
[00:29:37.105 --> 00:29:42.448]  He said, America will see a financial collapse that will be so great that it will take years to come out of it.
[00:29:42.548 --> 00:29:44.549]  At that time, we didn't have the bank crisis.
[00:29:44.589 --> 00:29:46.050]  We didn't have the real estate crisis.
[00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.152]  We didn't have the big bailout packages we've got right now.
[00:29:49.192 --> 00:29:50.773]  He told it all to me ahead of time.
[00:29:51.195 --> 00:29:57.878]  Because they had it planned exactly as you've been hearing Alex Jones say on his program day after day after day, folks.
[00:29:58.298 --> 00:30:01.159]  I wish I could shout it into every one of his homes today.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.441]  Believe everything you are hearing Alex Jones say.
[00:30:05.821 --> 00:30:08.082]  Even if you have trouble believing it, you believe it anyway.
[00:30:08.543 --> 00:30:10.403]  Because he's telling it to you in advance.
[00:30:10.483 --> 00:30:11.224]  Okay, here it is.
[00:30:11.324 --> 00:30:11.864]  In America.
[00:30:12.264 --> 00:30:16.526]  He said America will see a financial collapse so great it'll take years to come out of it.
[00:30:16.586 --> 00:30:18.367]  I'm going to tell you what happened yesterday.
[00:30:18.908 --> 00:30:24.631]  The Dow Jones stock market down 297.80 points at the close.
[00:30:25.212 --> 00:30:30.054]  The President signed a bailout package because America is in such horrible condition.
[00:30:30.415 --> 00:30:33.596]  And the Dow closed at 7,550 on yesterday.
[00:30:33.636 --> 00:30:35.257]  You tell me we're not in trouble?
[00:30:35.538 --> 00:30:36.678]  Now, let's go to oil.
[00:30:37.359 --> 00:30:40.280]  Oil yesterday went down to a bottom of $33.80.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:40.821]  Do you realize
[00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:57.431]  That the oil producing countries of the world, now this is everybody from Venezuela to Nigeria to all of the Arab countries, even to Mexico, our neighbor who is about bankrupt and oil is their major staple, and well, bought from drugs.
[00:30:57.771 --> 00:31:05.337]  And then of course the United States of America produces a certain amount of oil in Alaska, and Alaska is in big trouble financially now because of the tax shortfall.
[00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:09.279]  Do you realize that the ramifications of $33.80 oil yesterday
[00:31:12.014 --> 00:31:32.653]  Literally brings the world into bankruptcy so that the elite can own every bank, can own the majority of the real estate, they'll own nearly every mom-and-pop business, and when I give you, in a moment, one of the things that's taking place in Eastern and Central Europe, you are going to be devastated, and I'll give you this first hand, but let me go on with America first.
[00:31:33.263 --> 00:31:36.444]  Oil, $33.80 yesterday per barrel.
[00:31:36.784 --> 00:31:37.324]  It was $147.
[00:31:38.384 --> 00:31:43.045]  They have lost three-fourths, 75% of their income.
[00:31:43.726 --> 00:31:44.626]  Somebody loses it.
[00:31:44.966 --> 00:31:46.306]  Oil goes down that much.
[00:31:46.566 --> 00:31:47.627]  The seller doesn't get it.
[00:31:47.667 --> 00:31:48.787]  The buyer doesn't make it.
[00:31:48.807 --> 00:31:52.008]  The oil companies will eventually go into a problem.
[00:31:52.448 --> 00:31:57.249]  And, you know, I said 35 years ago in my book, and I know I'm going back 35 years now.
[00:31:58.479 --> 00:32:09.927]  An oil company official told me that eventually the oil companies would be nationalized, and it's written in my book, Energy Non-Crisis, and for 35 years I wondered how they'd do it, and I couldn't even see it for 35 years' time.
[00:32:10.347 --> 00:32:11.968]  I'm not even going into that today, Alex.
[00:32:12.008 --> 00:32:17.312]  That's another whole show within itself, because they're the biggest that nobody thought they could ever be taken over.
[00:32:17.372 --> 00:32:20.394]  You read it in my book, Energy Non-Crisis, for those of you who have it.
[00:32:20.414 --> 00:32:22.155]  So oil closed on yesterday.
[00:32:22.668 --> 00:32:26.189]  At $34.97 a barrel.
[00:32:26.229 --> 00:32:36.332]  Now, let's go to what David Walker, the former Comptroller General of the United States of America, he controlled the currency for a long time.
[00:32:36.372 --> 00:32:37.312]  He is now retired.
[00:32:37.753 --> 00:32:42.514]  He said, America's unfunded liability, please write this down.
[00:32:43.015 --> 00:32:46.817]  America's unfunded liability is $66 trillion.
[00:32:46.837 --> 00:32:53.941]  He went all across America trying to tell people what was going to happen because he foresaw what the elite were doing and he dared to tell it.
[00:32:54.442 --> 00:33:03.127]  He said, that includes the national debt, that includes Social Security, that includes Medicare and Medicaid, unfunded liability.
[00:33:03.587 --> 00:33:11.111]  Now, $66 trillion is more than the entire gross domestic product of the whole world!
[00:33:12.032 --> 00:33:12.292]  More!
[00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:13.342]  I think so.
[00:33:27.451 --> 00:33:40.279]  This is so catastrophic and so big, the elite have planned this so well that they have it to the point that they can literally own and control the world a dozen people.
[00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:44.462]  Can you comprehend a dozen people controlling the world?
[00:33:44.602 --> 00:33:49.366]  Chaplain Williams, let me just interrupt to add some small caveats to back up what you're saying.
[00:33:50.046 --> 00:33:50.967]  And this is on record.
[00:33:51.388 --> 00:33:54.091]  The central banks of the world dominate western nations.
[00:33:54.491 --> 00:33:56.093]  They set up fiat currencies.
[00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:58.316]  They buy up the majority of the world.
[00:33:58.696 --> 00:34:04.422]  They trick the Arabs and other oil producers to get into leveraged derivatives where they can make 10-15% a year.
[00:34:04.883 --> 00:34:06.525]  Most of their money is invested in that.
[00:34:06.645 --> 00:34:07.766]  They're leveraged.
[00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:17.730]  Then, the bankers implode the world real estate market, that's to hurt the average person, and then local communities to further implode us so they can buy us up.
[00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:23.555]  Imploding the oil is meant to shut down all the other nations that are based on that.
[00:34:24.296 --> 00:34:29.201]  And then out of this, the Financial Times of London, Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, all say
[00:34:30.441 --> 00:34:36.526]  That there will now be a new world order with one global bank that owns basically everything and gives everyone credit.
[00:34:36.906 --> 00:34:43.771]  And with that comes the control of the government through the private banks giving you your paycheck, putting money on your national ID.
[00:34:44.031 --> 00:34:46.053]  They're now announcing this will be how they save us.
[00:34:46.453 --> 00:34:48.835]  So they destroy everything so they can
[00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:54.518]  Force engineer society and put strings into everything we do.
[00:34:54.638 --> 00:34:58.820]  So that's how they have pumped up this massive bubble.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.361]  This is how they're doing it.
[00:35:00.401 --> 00:35:07.845]  And then cities like Dubai that have been built, you know, just like a palace, like Star Wars or something, so futuristic.
[00:35:08.265 --> 00:35:16.350]  All these other major cities that have been built up, all the construction, all the resources, the state governments go bankrupt because of the unfunded mandates.
[00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:17.991]  Everything goes bankrupt.
[00:35:18.011 --> 00:35:26.176]  The globalists come out with their new global monetary system, controlling all the currencies under one system, and they have total control.
[00:35:26.276 --> 00:35:27.697]  This is the economic setup.
[00:35:27.957 --> 00:35:38.244]  They set up globalism to get us all interdependent, to get us all into debt, to de-industrialize all the major free nations, to fully have control of us and have us institutionalized.
[00:35:38.604 --> 00:35:39.385]  Please continue.
[00:35:40.465 --> 00:35:45.929]  Just this morning, I read over all the majority of... It took about an hour.
[00:35:46.348 --> 00:35:54.610]  To read over the majority of the giveaways in the stimulus package that was signed on yesterday, I shuddered.
[00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.291]  The average American didn't have the slightest idea.
[00:35:57.311 --> 00:35:58.791]  Now, jot down two words for me.
[00:35:59.171 --> 00:36:00.431]  Number one is tax structure.
[00:36:01.052 --> 00:36:08.113]  Because of the price of crude oil going from $147 a barrel to $33.80 a barrel yesterday morning, at the gas pump, it went down from $4 to $5 a gallon
[00:36:15.831 --> 00:36:16.151]  I think so.
[00:36:40.311 --> 00:36:47.277]  All of the money that would be given away in Denver, they're going to the college, the university in Denver.
[00:36:47.677 --> 00:36:51.580]  They're going to improve, for instance, a ramp coming off of the interstate.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.321]  They're going to improve bridges.
[00:36:53.642 --> 00:36:55.023]  They're going to build this and build that.
[00:36:55.143 --> 00:37:01.508]  Do you realize that when I read the amount that they're giving for each of those things, that it was approximately only 40%?
[00:37:01.688 --> 00:37:06.292]  Now, Marcus, folks, if they gave you, say, $10 million,
[00:37:07.088 --> 00:37:13.914]  And you were supposed to build a new ramp off of such and such an interstate with this, and improve the parking lot in the college.
[00:37:14.154 --> 00:37:18.518]  Do you realize that they only gave you approximately 60% of what it would take to do that?
[00:37:19.058 --> 00:37:19.478]  That's right.
[00:37:19.558 --> 00:37:27.465]  In the stimulus package, they have intentionally planned it, and not a single congressman read the stimulus package.
[00:37:27.765 --> 00:37:28.586]  And I can see why.
[00:37:29.011 --> 00:37:37.971]  Because now, how are states going to be able to fund the additional 40% of all of these items that are listed in the stimulus package?
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:46.103]  The 60% that the federal government gave them is not going to do them a bit of good because the additional 40% they have to fund themselves.
[00:37:46.223 --> 00:37:48.303]  The feds have announced today how they're going to fund it.
[00:37:48.744 --> 00:37:56.186]  All cars, they're saying they're doing this through the states with mandates, are going to have satellite tracker box in them and tax you by the mile.
[00:37:56.226 --> 00:38:00.488]  Now every time you bring this up I get emails going, wait a minute, there's so much tax
[00:38:01.508 --> 00:38:06.672]  Slapped onto something, regardless of the overall price of fuel.
[00:38:08.193 --> 00:38:14.698]  But then I read that overall gas receipts are down, and different states are different though, aren't they?
[00:38:14.778 --> 00:38:20.622]  Some states it is per gallon, other states it is a percentage of how much you spend.
[00:38:21.243 --> 00:38:24.125]  Explain to people, because you are right, the gas receipts are down.
[00:38:24.605 --> 00:38:25.286]  Why are they down?
[00:38:26.465 --> 00:38:32.306]  They're down because they have lost 75% of the amount of taxes that they get off of a gallon of gasoline.
[00:38:32.686 --> 00:38:36.527]  Let's say that, I'm just taking a round figure now, I don't know the exact amount.
[00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:42.649]  Let's take a gallon of gasoline, $4 a gallon, back before the price went down to $50 a barrel for crude oil.
[00:38:42.969 --> 00:38:50.810]  And let's say that state and federal governments receive somewhere in the neighborhood of one half of that in the form of taxation because it's a huge figure.
[00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.471]  Now, they have lost that.
[00:38:52.671 --> 00:38:53.731]  They're not getting it anymore.
[00:38:54.164 --> 00:39:01.100]  Because the price of gasoline has gone down to a dollar and fifty cents a gallon, so instead of getting... I'm just rounding it off, because I don't know the figure.
[00:39:02.263 --> 00:39:04.348]  It's in my book, Energy Non-Crisis, by the way.
[00:39:04.935 --> 00:39:07.456]  Uh, let's say that they were getting $2, now they're getting $7.75.
[00:39:07.756 --> 00:39:14.159]  Do you realize how much taxes are lost on every gallon of gasoline that goes into a tank at a gas pump?
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:22.703]  Now, the tax structure base is going to literally be devastated because of this, plus people driving less now than they did before.
[00:39:22.723 --> 00:39:27.166]  I was about to say, that's the main reason is that people have less money to go on trips.
[00:39:27.386 --> 00:39:30.127]  Even though it's cheaper, they don't have the money to buy the gas, period.
[00:39:31.127 --> 00:39:45.670]  Now the states have to turn around and fund approximately 40 to 50 percent of all of the projects that have been given away in the stimulus package, but yet that tax base has been eroded so greatly within the past four to five, just four to five months, folks.
[00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:53.552]  The elite have accomplished everything that they wanted to accomplish so quickly, it's almost as if they have accelerated their program.
[00:39:53.852 --> 00:39:56.833]  Now the states are required to turn around and pay 40 to 50 percent
[00:39:57.952 --> 00:39:59.413]  Well, Lindsey, that was my next point.
[00:39:59.433 --> 00:40:01.574]  You said on there, he said it would go at least below $50 a barrel.
[00:40:01.594 --> 00:40:03.174]  It is $33.30 right now, so even lower than yesterday.
[00:40:03.194 --> 00:40:05.495]  I mean, what do you make of that, it going even below what they told you?
[00:40:21.428 --> 00:40:22.508]  Well, I'm amazed.
[00:40:24.609 --> 00:40:29.750]  A number of times, different people have said, Lindsey, why don't you please call this man back and get some more latest information?
[00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.970]  I'm going to admit to you, Alex, I've been afraid to.
[00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.011]  I'm frightened to even think of what he might tell me.
[00:40:36.331 --> 00:40:38.011]  Now, what do I make of this?
[00:40:38.371 --> 00:40:40.072]  The fact that they have accelerated that?
[00:40:40.552 --> 00:40:40.972]  Here it is.
[00:40:41.832 --> 00:40:47.013]  Alex, the reason they have done this, in my mind's thinking, is because they realize
[00:40:47.386 --> 00:40:55.533]  That programs like yours, people like Alex Jones, have awakened so many people that the American people are beginning to rebel.
[00:40:55.713 --> 00:41:02.098]  Over 20 states now have said, we are sending a message to Washington that we're no longer going to be under your control.
[00:41:02.118 --> 00:41:05.340]  This is another whole subject within itself.
[00:41:05.601 --> 00:41:07.923]  Now, let's go back to why they're doing this.
[00:41:08.603 --> 00:41:12.706]  Alex, when I lived with these people, I found that there was only one thing they were afraid of.
[00:41:13.147 --> 00:41:15.188]  The dollar didn't bother them, they had control of that.
[00:41:15.248 --> 00:41:17.130]  Congress didn't concern them, the President
[00:41:17.506 --> 00:41:18.507]  They didn't mind him at all.
[00:41:18.547 --> 00:41:20.149]  He's just a little puppet sitting up there.
[00:41:21.049 --> 00:41:25.013]  What is the one thing that I found that these people are scared to death of?
[00:41:25.353 --> 00:41:28.216]  They are afraid of the American public.
[00:41:28.356 --> 00:41:30.498]  The masses of people waking up.
[00:41:30.919 --> 00:41:33.321]  And that's where Alex Jones Show comes in.
[00:41:33.761 --> 00:41:35.523]  That's where InfoWars comes in.
[00:41:35.543 --> 00:41:37.565]  That's where InfoWars.com comes in.
[00:41:38.072 --> 00:41:46.315]  Every bit of this is the thing that frightens them more than anything else in this world, is because when the masses of people wake up, they don't have a chance.
[00:41:46.375 --> 00:42:00.701]  There's a handful of them, and there's millions of us, and I believe, Alex, the reason that they have, what should I say, accelerated their program worldwide, not just in America, but worldwide, and gone below $50 a barrel,
[00:42:02.062 --> 00:42:07.869]  The reason I believe they've done it is because so many, such masses of Americans are waking up just because of people like you, Alex.
[00:42:12.233 --> 00:42:18.057]  When you look at history, the only thing that threatens them is the people taking control of the government legitimately.
[00:42:18.217 --> 00:42:19.398]  They've bought off the government.
[00:42:20.038 --> 00:42:25.381]  And the elite is threatened by the people taking their government back and then prosecuting these globalists.
[00:42:25.802 --> 00:42:27.763]  When they're all just a bunch of Bernard Madoffs.
[00:42:27.803 --> 00:42:32.826]  I mean, imagine, these are just the kingpins above him who set up ultra-massive Ponzi schemes.
[00:42:32.866 --> 00:42:33.627]  I want you to speak
[00:42:34.187 --> 00:42:36.089]  Directly to that, Lindsey Williams, when we get back.
[00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:39.131]  And when we start the next hour, we're going to have until 40 after next hour.
[00:42:39.171 --> 00:42:40.733]  You're gracious to spend this much time with us.
[00:42:41.173 --> 00:42:45.257]  We're going to talk to a whole bunch of callers that are patiently holding when we start the next hour.
[00:42:46.057 --> 00:42:48.119]  Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:56.787]  It is Wednesday, the 18th of February, 2009, and the world is in the boa constrictor grip of the Global Crime Syndicate.
[00:42:57.447 --> 00:42:58.468]  All we can do is fight.
[00:42:58.528 --> 00:42:59.388]  We don't have a choice.
[00:42:59.628 --> 00:43:03.270]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:08.993]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:43:09.073 --> 00:43:12.995]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:43:13.015 --> 00:43:13.776]  We're good to go!

[00:43:53.542 --> 00:43:53.722]  That's 800-387-5516.
[00:43:53.762 --> 00:43:54.442]  Free shipping included.
[00:43:59.648 --> 00:44:06.033]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:06.413 --> 00:44:08.395]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:09.055 --> 00:44:10.096]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:10.596 --> 00:44:11.117]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:11.397 --> 00:44:12.278]  This is his ammo.
[00:44:12.298 --> 00:44:13.679]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:13.699 --> 00:44:15.440]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:22.506]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:22.906 --> 00:44:23.346]  Some U.S.
[00:44:23.406 --> 00:44:29.031]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:29.731 --> 00:44:33.212]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:33.232 --> 00:44:36.033]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:44:59.719 --> 00:45:05.401]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:10.442]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:45:10.462 --> 00:45:15.664]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:45:15.884 --> 00:45:19.265]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:45:19.805 --> 00:45:27.968]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:45:28.308 --> 00:45:33.290]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:45:34.111 --> 00:45:39.853]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:45:40.093 --> 00:45:42.414]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:45:42.694 --> 00:45:45.115]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[00:45:55.521 --> 00:46:04.607]  Body Union's a big business man, and it's going down like a dinosaur.
[00:46:10.787 --> 00:46:17.294]  You know, Bob Dylan knows about the New World Order.
[00:46:17.994 --> 00:46:20.757]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:46:36.215 --> 00:46:42.837]  I don't have to listen to his music to know that, by the way.
[00:46:43.117 --> 00:46:45.357]  Yeah, democracy don't rule the world.
[00:46:45.417 --> 00:46:48.458]  You better get that through your head.
[00:46:49.598 --> 00:46:52.119]  This world is ruled by violence.
[00:46:52.239 --> 00:46:56.500]  Democracy don't rule the world.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.021]  You better get that through your head.
[00:47:00.241 --> 00:47:02.941]  This world is ruled by violence.
[00:47:03.041 --> 00:47:05.542]  But I guess that's better left unsaid.
[00:47:06.656 --> 00:47:07.357]  We are back live.
[00:47:07.397 --> 00:47:09.060]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:47:10.963 --> 00:47:13.027]  That's a lot of territory.
[00:47:14.629 --> 00:47:15.651]  That's the New World Order.
[00:47:21.095 --> 00:47:22.276]  We are back live.
[00:47:22.296 --> 00:47:24.297]  Ladies and gentlemen, they will give us a new quarter.
[00:47:24.317 --> 00:47:25.237]  They're not going to back off.
[00:47:25.257 --> 00:47:27.579]  They want you totally bankrupt on a government card.
[00:47:27.799 --> 00:47:44.368]  Even middle class nouveau riche are going to be bankrupted by this unless we politically say you're foreign offshore criminal banks, you're a bunch of made-offs, you engineered this, we have all their documents, admissions, and unless a lot of people more powerful than I or Lindsey Williams get on the ball, you're going to be destroyed too.
[00:47:44.488 --> 00:47:46.289]  Police, military, everybody.
[00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:47.450]  We're in the boat together.
[00:47:48.615 --> 00:47:50.376]  You may think you're on the winning team of the New World Order.
[00:47:50.416 --> 00:47:51.156]  You're really with us.
[00:47:51.616 --> 00:47:53.297]  And the sooner you figure that out, the better.
[00:47:53.317 --> 00:47:54.537]  I know a lot of you are figuring that out.
[00:47:54.957 --> 00:47:57.318]  Lindsey, we've got about four minutes left in this segment.
[00:47:58.198 --> 00:48:03.000]  Cover any other key info you want to get into, and then we're going to start the next hour and take phone calls.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.480]  Their timetable is right on time.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.882]  They're doing everything exactly as I was told six months ago that they were going to do it.
[00:48:10.262 --> 00:48:13.543]  Here are the statements that you can expect over the next year to a year and a half.
[00:48:14.093 --> 00:48:19.554]  America will see, now I'm quoting this man word for word, I would not change his words for anything.
[00:48:19.994 --> 00:48:25.916]  America will see a financial collapse that will be so great that it will take years to come out of it.
[00:48:26.336 --> 00:48:27.176]  What are you going to see?
[00:48:27.636 --> 00:48:31.657]  You're going to see the next 12 months time an erosion of the American dollar.
[00:48:31.857 --> 00:48:34.638]  You will eventually see a collapse of the American dollar.
[00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:38.679]  Prepare your table because they already have it planned.
[00:48:38.999 --> 00:48:39.799]  What are you going to see?
[00:48:40.099 --> 00:48:43.080]  You're going to see, well you just saw inflation
[00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:47.609]  Now you're going to see massive, I'm sorry, you saw deflation over Christmas.
[00:48:47.629 --> 00:48:52.491]  You're going to see massive inflation within six months, nine months, maximum one year.
[00:48:52.992 --> 00:49:01.156]  Next, you're going to see continual closings, such as Circuit City just the other day, whereby 500 stores were closed.
[00:49:01.716 --> 00:49:07.519]  Going out of business altogether, 13 million square feet of commercial office space now is lying idle.
[00:49:07.952 --> 00:49:09.553]  And they say, oh, somebody will take it up.
[00:49:09.593 --> 00:49:10.053]  No, they won't.
[00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:12.174]  Not when other businesses are going out.
[00:49:13.155 --> 00:49:14.756]  34,000 workers were idled.
[00:49:15.076 --> 00:49:16.177]  What else are you going to see?
[00:49:16.437 --> 00:49:19.959]  You're going to see a total collapse of the oil-producing countries of the world.
[00:49:20.299 --> 00:49:24.141]  Countries like Dubai and many of the Saudi and others.
[00:49:25.622 --> 00:49:28.583]  You're going to see those countries have major financial problems.
[00:49:29.024 --> 00:49:30.084]  Let's go on a little further.
[00:49:30.344 --> 00:49:33.466]  Oh, this one is the one that is most concerning.
[00:49:34.066 --> 00:49:36.088]  The powers that know what's going on.
[00:49:36.408 --> 00:49:36.828]  Here it is.
[00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:39.288]  Eastern and Central Europe.
[00:49:39.348 --> 00:49:43.950]  And folks, this could be so catastrophic for our economy in America.
[00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:45.150]  It would be unbelievable.
[00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:46.711]  Listen to what's happening over there.
[00:49:47.151 --> 00:49:49.972]  Hungary's point fell to an all-time low on Monday.
[00:49:50.032 --> 00:49:52.273]  That's this week, the day before yesterday.
[00:49:52.673 --> 00:49:56.394]  Poland's Glocky slumped to the lowest in five years.
[00:49:56.775 --> 00:49:58.595]  It used to be two Glockys to a dollar.
[00:49:58.615 --> 00:50:00.116]  Now it's four Glockys to a dollar.
[00:50:00.516 --> 00:50:03.157]  Half of all loans in the private sector in Poland
[00:50:03.607 --> 00:50:08.591]  And foreign countries owe the borrowers, and they're facing severe debt shock.
[00:50:08.931 --> 00:50:10.953]  Will this have ramifications in America?
[00:50:11.333 --> 00:50:12.114]  Positively.
[00:50:12.754 --> 00:50:14.396]  And this is exactly what was said.
[00:50:14.456 --> 00:50:15.176]  Listen to the man.
[00:50:15.637 --> 00:50:24.244]  We're nearing the level where things could get out of hand, said Hans Riddick, Currency Chief Strategist for BNP Polaris.
[00:50:24.604 --> 00:50:30.008]  The mushrooming crisis has already started to spill over into Germany's debt market.
[00:50:30.048 --> 00:50:31.710]  This is what's scaring the people to debt.
[00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:34.012]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:34.093 --> 00:50:34.893]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:49.787 --> 00:50:51.368]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:51.468 --> 00:50:56.029]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:56.209 --> 00:50:58.970]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:02.031]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:02.211 --> 00:51:06.933]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:07.173 --> 00:51:08.074]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:08.294 --> 00:51:11.236]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:11.537 --> 00:51:18.442]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:21.645]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:51:38.519 --> 00:51:38.939]  Take action today.
[00:51:38.959 --> 00:51:40.941]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:52.463 --> 00:51:54.364]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:54.865 --> 00:51:57.826]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:11.695]  We are blasting out on the AM and FM dials, simulcasting on global shortwave WWCR.
[00:52:13.016 --> 00:52:16.358]  Only about a third of our internet streams are listed on Shoutcast.
[00:52:17.947 --> 00:52:20.048]  Because the way we stream, we're trying to fix that.
[00:52:20.669 --> 00:52:33.936]  And we are, 1, 2, 3, 4, number 5 overall on Shoutcast, the 5th most listened to internet radio show, number 5, number 1 in talk.
[00:52:35.357 --> 00:52:37.038]  And we're like that every day and growing.
[00:52:38.019 --> 00:52:41.941]  We can just figure out how to get all our streams to show up on here, but we have them on different
[00:52:43.115 --> 00:52:48.738]  Systems will be number one every day on Shoutcast.
[00:52:50.078 --> 00:52:51.239]  Now, why do I bring that up?
[00:52:51.579 --> 00:52:53.179]  This information is too important.
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:56.021]  It's not enough to have around 2 million listeners a day.
[00:52:56.921 --> 00:53:09.427]  We need to have tens of millions of listeners and if all of you listening will tell people how to listen, where you listen, if you're listening on an AM station, they don't have one in their area or friends or family, they can listen at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:12.475 --> 00:53:14.358]  Or if they have a shortwave radio they can listen.
[00:53:14.578 --> 00:53:16.000]  Folks, we need more listeners.
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:17.783]  This information needs to get out.
[00:53:17.823 --> 00:53:27.257]  Like when I get on air and go, oh, here's a mainstream news article about how half the corn syrup products in America have high levels of mercury in them.
[00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:33.065]  That's been out for a month and no one still knows because we don't reach enough people.
[00:53:33.545 --> 00:53:34.386]  We've got to grow.
[00:53:34.466 --> 00:53:36.207]  Please spread the word about the show.
[00:53:36.227 --> 00:53:42.993]  Lindsey, I want to come back in the next segment and go directly to calls and only take calls until about 40, 45 after and I appreciate your time with us.
[00:53:43.033 --> 00:53:46.476]  I do want to spend some time to plug these new video reports you're doing each month.
[00:53:46.776 --> 00:53:47.897]  Very powerful info.
[00:53:47.957 --> 00:53:50.560]  Great to show people because this is an audio format.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:56.565]  People really like video format to show their friends and family so we'll get to that before you leave us as well.
[00:53:57.105 --> 00:54:02.930]  But in the four minutes we've got left of this segment, continue with what is going to unfold and what is going to happen.
[00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:04.852]  The NORTHCOM, the martial law, the troops.
[00:54:05.372 --> 00:54:06.313]  We don't have a choice.
[00:54:06.333 --> 00:54:11.478]  They're planning to create a crisis where we have to have federal help and then we're totally enslaved.
[00:54:11.778 --> 00:54:12.679]  How do we avert this?
[00:54:13.019 --> 00:54:14.060]  Or is there any averting it?
[00:54:15.041 --> 00:54:17.543]  What the elite are doing is global.
[00:54:17.783 --> 00:54:20.806]  We originally thought this was just going to be something for the United States.
[00:54:20.886 --> 00:54:22.067]  What this gentleman told me
[00:54:22.625 --> 00:54:27.688]  When he gave me what would happen in the next 12 months' time, he dealt only with the United States of America.
[00:54:27.748 --> 00:54:31.511]  Now we're seeing the identical same thing happen globally.
[00:54:31.991 --> 00:54:35.514]  Listen, if you will, to what Hans Redeker said just the other day.
[00:54:36.254 --> 00:54:44.800]  He said investors are beginning to ask whether Germany is going to have to pay for the rescue, same thing that we just signed the rescue bill on yesterday.
[00:54:45.585 --> 00:54:48.767]  Rescue all of Eastern and Central Europe.
[00:54:49.027 --> 00:54:54.670]  Can you imagine all of Eastern and Central Europe going into bankruptcy?
[00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:56.991]  Germany can't possibly rescue them.
[00:54:57.291 --> 00:54:58.412]  So what are we going to see?
[00:54:58.772 --> 00:55:02.614]  We are going to see a worldwide total financial collapse.
[00:55:02.674 --> 00:55:04.635]  And you say, well how is this going to affect me?
[00:55:04.996 --> 00:55:05.676]  I'll tell you how.
[00:55:06.196 --> 00:55:11.339]  Whenever you need to take a wheelbarrow load of dollar bills to the grocery store,
[00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:21.437]  In order to buy a loaf of bread, you are going to be so devastated in your ability to be able to even put food on your table, you are going to beg the Federal Reserve for another currency.
[00:55:21.697 --> 00:55:29.482]  Lock my words, put it down, Alex has talked about this before also, what they're going to do with the currencies, and they're going to make you want it.
[00:55:29.923 --> 00:55:36.347]  In fact, you not only will not want to reject it, you'll be begging for it just so you can put food on your table.
[00:55:36.567 --> 00:55:37.528]  So what will they give you?
[00:55:37.928 --> 00:55:40.210]  They'll give you what they have planned all the time.
[00:55:40.578 --> 00:55:41.859]  They'll give you the new currency.
[00:55:42.219 --> 00:55:50.665]  Whether it be a world currency, or whether it be the North American Union currency, they'll have one right ready to give you whenever you beg for it because you're hurting so bad.
[00:55:51.126 --> 00:55:54.128]  So we'll see exactly what this gentleman told me would happen.
[00:55:54.508 --> 00:55:55.069]  America will collapse.
[00:55:55.169 --> 00:56:01.794]  And by the way, this just ends the Vickney Brzezinski MSNBC this morning, said there's going to be food riots worldwide.
[00:56:02.674 --> 00:56:04.416]  So again, they just love what they've done.
[00:56:06.097 --> 00:56:08.899]  Well yeah, they have it planned so that there's no way out.
[00:56:09.568 --> 00:56:24.356]  Uh, you see, the average person said to me back a year ago, before any of this happened, I remember I was, uh, speaking at a convention in Panama, and someone walked up to me afterwards and said, oh, Chaplain, no way would I ever accept anything but an American dollar.
[00:56:24.677 --> 00:56:26.598]  And I would ring back, because we've got it right now.
[00:56:26.758 --> 00:56:27.758]  I said, yes, you will.
[00:56:28.199 --> 00:56:34.322]  I said, you will be begging the Federal Reserve for another currency when you take a wheelbarrow load to the grocery store tomorrow.
[00:56:34.402 --> 00:56:35.963]  They have it all planned.
[00:56:36.462 --> 00:56:38.083]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:56:38.143 --> 00:56:39.143]  They create the crisis.
[00:56:39.163 --> 00:56:40.344]  We say, what are they going to do about it?
[00:56:40.404 --> 00:56:41.245]  They have the solution.
[00:56:41.305 --> 00:56:43.786]  Wall Street Journal says, new currency.
[00:56:43.846 --> 00:56:46.667]  It'll still be the dollar, but it'll be pegged to North America.
[00:56:47.068 --> 00:56:47.708]  Open borders.
[00:56:47.968 --> 00:56:48.468]  It's here.
[00:56:48.929 --> 00:56:51.810]  This is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.991]  You don't have a choice.
[00:56:53.051 --> 00:56:54.752]  These are hardcore criminals in control.
[00:56:55.652 --> 00:56:56.133]  Stay there.
[00:56:56.514 --> 00:56:59.439]  Lindsey Williams will come back and take phone calls on the other side.
[00:56:59.459 --> 00:57:06.410]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:57:06.771 --> 00:57:08.373]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[00:57:09.406 --> 00:57:10.426]  But who is the enemy?
[00:57:10.947 --> 00:57:11.447]  Bin Laden.
[00:57:11.747 --> 00:57:12.727]  This is his M.O.
[00:57:12.748 --> 00:57:14.088]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:57:14.108 --> 00:57:15.749]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:22.852]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:57:23.252 --> 00:57:23.692]  Some U.S.
[00:57:23.732 --> 00:57:29.395]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:57:30.075 --> 00:57:33.538]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:57:33.558 --> 00:57:35.739]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:58:00.177 --> 00:58:03.562]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:58:03.702 --> 00:58:08.929]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:13.815]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:58:15.097 --> 00:58:25.420]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:31.322]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:58:31.542 --> 00:58:37.624]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:58:37.804 --> 00:58:38.464]  What about you?
[00:58:38.844 --> 00:58:42.965]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.

[00:58:49.771 --> 00:58:51.472]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:05.872]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:59:06.233 --> 00:59:09.655]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:59:10.015 --> 00:59:16.200]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:21.644]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:59:21.804 --> 00:59:28.509]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:29.710]  Need something more?
[00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:33.574]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[00:59:33.874 --> 00:59:41.922]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.

[01:00:01.277 --> 01:00:07.281]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.902 --> 01:00:10.864]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.855 --> 01:00:18.118]  All right, we're back live and going to your phone calls here.
[01:00:18.138 --> 01:00:19.359]  Pull up the call list.
[01:00:21.881 --> 01:00:24.643]  Let's talk to Captain Truth in Nevada.
[01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:27.465]  You're on the air with myself, Alex Jones, and Lindsey Williams.
[01:00:27.485 --> 01:00:27.886]  Go ahead.
[01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:31.789]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex and Lindsey Williams.
[01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:41.757]  I'd like to personally speak for my family and identify to both of you that we really appreciate both of what
[01:00:43.436 --> 01:00:47.617]  What both of your families have done to help this country and our future.
[01:00:48.238 --> 01:00:49.078]  Well, we've tried, sir.
[01:00:49.118 --> 01:00:59.281]  Lindsey, I met you here in Las Vegas a few years ago, and I've always treasured shaking your hand.
[01:01:00.162 --> 01:01:05.524]  Yesterday, a situation came up with the state and the Tenth Amendment movement.
[01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:07.524]  I hope you're aware of that.
[01:01:08.225 --> 01:01:09.165]  Yeah, I talked about it earlier.
[01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:15.129]  Yeah, there was an individual who talked about, well, aren't the states tied into the money?
[01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:19.791]  And I wanted to make and see what you thought of this.
[01:01:19.891 --> 01:01:26.933]  It came from an individual that I had the pleasure to meet in the 10th Amendment from Colorado when they started it.
[01:01:27.533 --> 01:01:34.115]  He came here and did a seminar and he contacted, he was harassed by the federal government people.
[01:01:34.778 --> 01:01:38.340]  Who said that, you know, we'll just cut off the state funds.
[01:01:38.541 --> 01:01:41.362]  And he says, well, let me see, think about that for a second.
[01:01:41.402 --> 01:01:51.209]  We send you the gasoline tax money, and our citizens send you the income tax money, and then you send a few, a little bit of it back to us.
[01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:54.311]  How about if we just don't send that money to you?
[01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:58.654]  And just keep, take what we got coming from you, and if there's anything left, we'll send it to you.
[01:01:59.034 --> 01:02:00.515]  He was never threatened again.
[01:02:00.595 --> 01:02:03.037]  Do you think that that situation might work?
[01:02:03.735 --> 01:02:07.526]  Well, that's what... In fact, that's the answer to the whole situation of the taxes.
[01:02:08.342 --> 01:02:12.864]  Now, that's what North comes for, though, to try to force it, but that is political suicide for the globalists.
[01:02:13.144 --> 01:02:19.486]  They'll have to stage some terror attacks or stage some riots as their pretext to come in, and that's where all this is headed.
[01:02:19.546 --> 01:02:21.027]  That's where this is going.
[01:02:21.047 --> 01:02:22.667]  That's where we're focusing on states' rights.
[01:02:22.688 --> 01:02:23.588]  But let me just cover this.
[01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:26.289]  Greenspan backs bank nationalization.
[01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:27.689]  This is not nationalization.
[01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:35.392]  The banker bailout bill just wasn't about the $800 billion that's really $7 trillion, and then $8.5 trillion, and now $9.7 trillion.
[01:02:35.412 --> 01:02:36.613]  That's official government numbers.
[01:02:37.745 --> 01:02:40.307]  They won't say where the money went, that's just the gross number they're giving.
[01:02:41.288 --> 01:02:42.829]  This is about the foreign banks.
[01:02:42.889 --> 01:02:47.913]  Through that banker bailout, they're given power to take over industries, you name it.
[01:02:48.533 --> 01:02:51.916]  And so that's really what's happening, is it's not nationalization.
[01:02:52.196 --> 01:03:02.444]  They're using the national front for foreign banks to fully bring the nation into receivership, just like the robber barons and the big banks have done in third world countries over and over again.
[01:03:02.484 --> 01:03:03.725]  Lindsey Williams, can you speak to that?
[01:03:04.534 --> 01:03:06.256]  The elite have everything to gain by this.
[01:03:06.576 --> 01:03:08.618]  They have the majority of the real estate in America.
[01:03:08.658 --> 01:03:17.826]  They will control the banking system of America through the Treasury of the United States of America, where they have given out billions of dollars to the banks.
[01:03:17.846 --> 01:03:24.052]  They have put every stipulation imaginable on them to the part that it is outright socialism to the core.
[01:03:24.652 --> 01:03:28.776]  We will be as hardcore as Russia was during the last Cold War.
[01:03:29.642 --> 01:03:31.004]  So Alex, you're exactly right.
[01:03:31.364 --> 01:03:39.216]  Every bit of this is to the end of total control of both banking, housing, mom-and-pop businesses, and the majority of everything.
[01:03:39.396 --> 01:03:43.862]  And let me just add the proviso or addendum caveat to this.
[01:03:45.353 --> 01:03:49.895]  You're going to have tens of millions of out-of-work people who believe Obama is their savior.
[01:03:49.935 --> 01:03:54.358]  The media has made him this messianic leader, this anti-corruption guy when he's owned by the very people.
[01:03:54.978 --> 01:04:00.201]  And so they're going to be getting government credits, they're already announcing this, on their national ID card.
[01:04:00.741 --> 01:04:07.285]  And so the government is going to point at us that are fighting it and say, look, they're the ones that don't want you to get the free federal money.
[01:04:07.805 --> 01:04:12.386]  And they're going to rob the middle class, and they're going to have an army of goons and spies, which they're now announcing.
[01:04:12.626 --> 01:04:17.347]  The army has now taken what Obama said and done it, a million-person domestic force.
[01:04:18.047 --> 01:04:22.788]  I mean, when Lindsey says they mean hardcore Sovietism, he's not playing games.
[01:04:23.168 --> 01:04:23.468]  Lindsey?
[01:04:24.788 --> 01:04:25.849]  Yes, you're exactly right.
[01:04:25.969 --> 01:04:27.329]  That's exactly what they plan.
[01:04:27.669 --> 01:04:32.010]  And the thing is, though, Alex, this individual told me six months ago
[01:04:32.526 --> 01:04:40.651]  That America was going to see a financial collapse so great it would take years to come out of it, and he basically was telling me, in his way of putting it, everything that they're doing.
[01:04:40.731 --> 01:04:52.879]  Alex, the devastating, the horrifying part of this is these people, the elite, whom I knew, lived with for those three years, they have planned all of this well in advance and are carrying it out.
[01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:53.900]  Every angle.
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:54.760]  Every angle.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.320]  Every angle.
[01:04:55.961 --> 01:04:57.162]  I mean, they have figured out that...
[01:04:58.902 --> 01:05:04.845]  Well, I mean, for those that are in denial about this, number one, it's all admitted what they're doing, and they've come right out and said it.
[01:05:04.865 --> 01:05:07.846]  They're just posing as the saviors, but admitting their whole agenda for world government.
[01:05:08.486 --> 01:05:19.491]  The issue here is that even if somebody won't check our facts and find out we're telling the truth, they should at least know, since when has a power elite not set things up to implode so they can take over?
[01:05:19.511 --> 01:05:21.192]  Since when do they not create crises?
[01:05:21.492 --> 01:05:23.733]  You cannot be in denial anymore, people.
[01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:24.153]  Lindsey?
[01:05:25.294 --> 01:05:26.234]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[01:05:26.274 --> 01:05:28.475]  They create a crisis and they create a solution.
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:30.981]  And they have all of them planned well in advance.
[01:05:31.341 --> 01:05:33.462]  And I saw this years ago when I lived with these people.
[01:05:33.682 --> 01:05:48.886]  Can you imagine a Baptist preacher, pastor of a church of 400 people for 12 years, then a missionary in Alaska flying little airplanes around, believing that everybody was honest and everything was fine, being brought up in a fine Christian home, and all of a sudden I'm thrown into the board meetings of the elite of the world?
[01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:56.509]  Folks, you're talking about having the very depth of your foundation of your whole being shattered
[01:05:57.003 --> 01:06:07.005]  I remember I went back to my dorm room one night, I looked up at the ceiling, I laid there and literally cried out to God, and I said, oh God, how can there be such dastardly people existing on the face of this earth, Alex?
[01:06:08.525 --> 01:06:09.045]  Absolutely.
[01:06:09.085 --> 01:06:09.865]  Caller, thank you.
[01:06:10.245 --> 01:06:12.006]  Let's talk to Dan in California.
[01:06:12.386 --> 01:06:14.126]  Dan, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:06:14.146 --> 01:06:15.086]  How you doing?
[01:06:15.466 --> 01:06:15.746]  Good.
[01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:25.428]  I'd like to congratulate you on, I'd like to buy you a beer, man, and say, you know what, you are brave talking the truth in Texas, because that could get you
[01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:27.709]  You know, it's in trouble out there.
[01:06:27.729 --> 01:06:28.409]  Let me say this.
[01:06:28.509 --> 01:06:30.751]  It'll get us in a lot more trouble if we don't stand up.
[01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:32.293]  And I want to explain something.
[01:06:32.313 --> 01:06:34.535]  It is not brave, overall, what we've done.
[01:06:35.015 --> 01:06:41.181]  If I see an iceberg coming towards the ship and I go, hey, I got binoculars, there's an iceberg out there, it's not that I'm brave.
[01:06:41.361 --> 01:06:42.662]  I don't want to hit the iceberg.
[01:06:43.904 --> 01:06:44.824]  I feel you completely.
[01:06:44.844 --> 01:06:45.325]  You know what?
[01:06:45.785 --> 01:06:48.468]  Everything that Lindsey is about is true.
[01:06:48.868 --> 01:06:49.509]  And you know what?
[01:06:49.729 --> 01:06:51.791]  It's an arm of the petroleum cartel.
[01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:54.362]  I don't want to disagree.
[01:06:54.382 --> 01:06:56.303]  You know more than I do.
[01:06:56.343 --> 01:06:57.123]  They're just an arm.
[01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:12.431]  Well, I agree with you, but let me say this.
[01:07:13.072 --> 01:07:30.423]  Six, eight months ago, seven months ago, when Rex Tillerson of Exxon Mobil, second biggest corporation in the world at Walmart, said global warming is a fraud, a scam, a tax, David Rockefeller went to board meetings and pointed out he was the majority owner and threatened to fire him, and so now Rex Tillerson has come out and said it's all real, taxes will save us.
[01:07:31.444 --> 01:07:32.865]  I mean, Lindsey, who runs things?
[01:07:34.586 --> 01:07:35.607]  Oh, the elite run things.
[01:07:35.847 --> 01:07:38.509]  I mean, the very top is probably a dozen men there.
[01:07:39.025 --> 01:07:45.709]  Then under them is the Council of Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, under them the media, and everyone knows less than the other one knew.
[01:07:46.049 --> 01:07:47.310]  Yeah, that's them right there.
[01:07:48.951 --> 01:07:49.771]  Glenn Culler.
[01:07:51.112 --> 01:07:52.733]  Let me say this.
[01:07:52.893 --> 01:07:53.714]  I want to get this out.
[01:07:54.174 --> 01:07:55.955]  Stevia, you probably haven't heard about it.
[01:07:56.815 --> 01:08:00.057]  The FDA certainly heard about it because they hunted it down like cocaine.
[01:08:00.938 --> 01:08:07.882]  It's cured cancer in India, and it turns water morphate, when you blend it, into a natural gas called split H2O.
[01:08:08.735 --> 01:08:10.816]  This is provable scientific fact.
[01:08:11.276 --> 01:08:25.019]  It brought a cat, 17 years old, had throat cancer, was skeleton thin, she was at the vet about to be put down, and it brought her back into perfect health, and she is literally a biblical miracle.
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:30.681]  You're talking, Lindsey, that nothing short of an act of God would actually save this planet?
[01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:31.381]  Is that right?
[01:08:32.121 --> 01:08:33.082]  That's exactly right.
[01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:37.943]  I tell you, sir, I have discovered a biblical miracle.
[01:08:38.416 --> 01:08:39.757]  And I can prove every word.
[01:08:39.777 --> 01:08:41.697]  Alright, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:08:42.398 --> 01:08:48.160]  Where is that in the Bible that the people will humble themselves and come before me and repent?
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:58.164]  And people who don't believe in religion or God or Christianity, I mean, for them the issue is, we're not going to fix things until we humble ourselves and admit we've been scammed and screwed and are in trouble.
[01:08:58.504 --> 01:09:01.745]  But so many yuppies are still arrogant, they're in denial, they're spoiled.
[01:09:02.286 --> 01:09:03.566]  Can you speak to that, Lindsey?
[01:09:03.786 --> 01:09:05.607]  What's the line in the Bible about humbling yourself?
[01:09:06.428 --> 01:09:07.669]  Yes, it's in the Old Testament.
[01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:13.993]  If my people, which are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face, I will heal their land.
[01:09:14.594 --> 01:09:16.635]  And it goes on and on to tell what they'll do.
[01:09:17.035 --> 01:09:24.800]  Alex, on the last show, last week, you asked me a question, and I couldn't answer it at the time because I didn't have my Bible right in front of me.
[01:09:25.281 --> 01:09:29.123]  Folks, the first thing you need to do at this point is set your spiritual house in order.
[01:09:29.564 --> 01:09:34.567]  I beg of you, before you do anything else, you get that house on a solid rock.
[01:09:35.382 --> 01:09:36.483]  Off of sinking sand.
[01:09:37.184 --> 01:09:39.105]  Listen, please, I beg of you.
[01:09:39.666 --> 01:09:46.631]  When Christ was ascending up into heaven, he said, Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[01:09:47.092 --> 01:09:49.274]  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me.
[01:09:49.914 --> 01:09:51.315]  I am meek and lowly in heart.
[01:09:51.415 --> 01:09:53.137]  You shall find rest unto your souls.
[01:09:53.177 --> 01:09:57.420]  That's the only place you're going to find rest and peace in the midst of all of this.
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:01.143]  That's in Matthew chapter 11 and verses 28 and 29.
[01:10:01.264 --> 01:10:04.086]  And I beg of you, as Christ went up, he said,
[01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:13.297]  While they looked steadfast towards heaven, he went up, and two men stood by them in white apparel and said, You men of Galilee, why are you standing here gazing up into heaven?
[01:10:13.358 --> 01:10:32.872]  This same Jesus which you've seen taken up from you into heaven shall come again in like manner as you've seen him go, and at that point, folks, he will conquer the elite, he will bring in his own kingdom, positively put your faith in the fact that God is going... You've read the last chapter!
[01:10:33.473 --> 01:10:36.276]  So, I beg of you, do this for me.
[01:10:36.436 --> 01:10:39.399]  Here it is, Alex, Romans 10, verses 9-10.
[01:10:39.439 --> 01:10:41.501]  The answer to the caller.
[01:10:41.921 --> 01:10:50.129]  If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
[01:10:50.490 --> 01:10:53.693]  How much plainer can you get than a promise like that from God?
[01:10:54.198 --> 01:11:02.801]  That in a perilous time in which we're living, there can be rejoicing and hope, because we know who is going to be the winner in the end.
[01:11:03.061 --> 01:11:04.642]  We've read the last chapter, Alex.
[01:11:05.482 --> 01:11:06.362]  Well, amen to that.
[01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:13.045]  And again, for people that don't believe in spiritual things, ethereal things, the elite do.
[01:11:13.145 --> 01:11:19.307]  They are obsessed with it, and they believe they're getting power from their God, and their God demands that they kill us.
[01:11:20.148 --> 01:11:27.573]  Well, one said to me one day, he said, Alex, he was talking to me as chaplain, he said, chaplain, we have a divine right to do this, a divine right to do what we're doing.
[01:11:27.934 --> 01:11:29.355]  I said, what are you talking about?
[01:11:29.795 --> 01:11:34.479]  He said, well, the average person in the world doesn't have the slightest idea how to run this universe.
[01:11:34.879 --> 01:11:37.581]  And he says, we're the ones that have the knowledge how to do it.
[01:11:38.141 --> 01:11:43.185]  I didn't say it to him, and I'm glad I didn't because I kept him as a friend enough that he'd tell me other things later.
[01:11:43.587 --> 01:11:49.790]  But you know, there is a divine right that they have, except the only difference is, they have one God, you and I have another.
[01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:53.391]  The Bible says there is a God of this world, the prince of the power of this air.
[01:11:53.451 --> 01:11:55.252]  He's known as Satan.
[01:11:55.732 --> 01:11:56.612]  Stay there, stay there!
[01:11:56.632 --> 01:11:57.233]  God of this world.
[01:11:59.887 --> 01:12:04.170]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:09.312]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:12:09.513 --> 01:12:10.853]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:12:11.013 --> 01:12:14.495]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:12:59.823 --> 01:13:05.287]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:06.848]  And we knew what to do.
[01:13:06.868 --> 01:13:08.649]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:13:08.869 --> 01:13:15.294]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:13:15.894 --> 01:13:21.078]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th, made a statement.
[01:13:22.045 --> 01:13:24.466]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[01:13:24.786 --> 01:13:31.587]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:13:31.887 --> 01:13:34.968]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:13:35.068 --> 01:13:40.289]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:43.470]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:51.152]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[01:13:53.746 --> 01:13:54.848]  The government sponsored terror.
[01:13:55.289 --> 01:13:57.775]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:13:59.209 --> 01:14:00.169]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:14:00.249 --> 01:14:05.031]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:12.994]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:14:13.274 --> 01:14:18.636]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:14:18.856 --> 01:14:25.819]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:14:26.119 --> 01:14:31.441]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:36.443]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:14:36.783 --> 01:14:44.405]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:14:44.725 --> 01:14:50.968]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:14:51.288 --> 01:14:52.408]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:55.154 --> 01:14:56.034]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:58.656 --> 01:15:08.741]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:15:09.221 --> 01:15:10.282]  Garden in a Can.

[01:15:29.252 --> 01:15:30.252]  Garden in a can.
[01:15:30.653 --> 01:15:31.513]  It's that simple.
[01:15:31.873 --> 01:15:33.734]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[01:15:34.255 --> 01:15:38.217]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.

[01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:06.854]  You see, Americans were taught to laugh and giggle about serious issues.
[01:16:06.894 --> 01:16:18.483]  We were taught there's no elite, there's no banking corruption, there's no powerful groups of corporations that get together to try to take control of government so they can rule and get away with their crimes.
[01:16:18.723 --> 01:16:20.725]  That's all tyranny is, is criminals in power.
[01:16:22.487 --> 01:16:25.009]  And if a nation goes on long enough, it always gets tyranny.
[01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:27.210]  This is a guarantee.
[01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:27.991]  This is 99% of history.
[01:16:30.254 --> 01:16:33.996]  And all these fools out there think the government's going to help them.
[01:16:34.076 --> 01:16:35.097]  It's not going to help you.
[01:16:35.117 --> 01:16:35.877]  It's not even the government.
[01:16:35.898 --> 01:16:38.019]  Keep taking calls here for Lindsey Williams.
[01:16:38.119 --> 01:16:40.000]  Sunny in Indiana, then Caleb, Jason and others.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.461]  Sunny, thanks for holding her on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[01:16:43.222 --> 01:16:45.023]  Hi Alex, great to finally talk to you.
[01:16:45.043 --> 01:16:48.765]  Me and my family have been listening to you for a couple years now.
[01:16:49.586 --> 01:16:57.731]  And I just want to give my eternal gratitude to you and Lindsey Williams and all of your people that you have on your show.
[01:16:58.775 --> 01:16:59.376]  It's amazing.
[01:16:59.676 --> 01:17:01.377]  I really thank you for everything you've done.
[01:17:01.858 --> 01:17:02.258]  Thank you.
[01:17:02.838 --> 01:17:03.619]  Thank you.
[01:17:03.639 --> 01:17:11.465]  I wanted to call today because my husband had seen something here in small-town Indiana that kind of worried me.
[01:17:12.386 --> 01:17:26.237]  We're about, I'd say, 200 miles southeast of Chicago, and he had seen a trailer, actually two trailers, behind the local fire station here, and the one had
[01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:39.316]  Mobile Hazmat WMD trailer as provided by the Indiana Department of Homeland Security.
[01:17:39.856 --> 01:17:46.400]  And the other trailer had the initials IPEEP on it.
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:50.522]  And we've looked all over for that acronym and haven't found it yet.
[01:17:51.163 --> 01:17:52.724]  So I don't even know what that is.
[01:17:53.304 --> 01:17:56.566]  But that trailer's gone, but the Hazmat trailer is still sitting there.
[01:17:57.410 --> 01:18:03.334]  And the reason why I wanted to call is, you know, we sit around here thinking that it's all, um, it's all global.
[01:18:03.355 --> 01:18:11.080]  It's not ever going to touch us when, you know, it'll come smack us in the face is the problem.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.181]  Well, let me tell you what's happening.
[01:18:13.102 --> 01:18:17.985]  When they announced that the Army and Marines are going to patrol America, the Army said how it was going to be rolled out.
[01:18:18.005 --> 01:18:20.687]  They say it's for crowd control, riot control, and to take over states.
[01:18:20.747 --> 01:18:21.568]  That's in all the orders.
[01:18:21.628 --> 01:18:25.231]  But when they publicly write an Army Times article, they said, yeah,
[01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:30.549]  The Army's going to help people at car wrecks now and work with local police.
[01:18:31.069 --> 01:18:34.170]  So that when the public hears it, oh, the Army's going to help.
[01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:39.211]  And they show video of the Jaws of Life and the troops cutting people out of a car.
[01:18:39.611 --> 01:18:42.152]  Or the Marines are going to stop drunk drivers.
[01:18:42.252 --> 01:18:43.872]  They're going to have checkpoints.
[01:18:44.652 --> 01:18:47.573]  Oh, the Army's going to fight drugs in Austin, Texas.
[01:18:48.613 --> 01:18:50.015]  So they roll it out.
[01:18:50.055 --> 01:18:56.123]  So they started secretly with Marines and Army raiding gun dealers and gun shops in the 80s.
[01:18:56.143 --> 01:18:57.285]  The earliest we know is about 1986.
[01:18:57.325 --> 01:18:57.665]  Tim Rogatirni.
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:00.780]  Yeah.
[01:19:01.301 --> 01:19:12.487]  And now, again, they've federalized every city and town, they've built FEMA camps, FEMA bunkers, mass graves, incinerators, and most of the police don't even know, but now it's starting to come out.
[01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:18.851]  So see, this is their, you're seeing their PR vanguard, so the local police don't say, hey, we don't want to be federalized.
[01:19:19.391 --> 01:19:25.074]  They go, hey, we're here to help you, there's a bio-attack, here's some money, you do what we say, and then they're now under federal control.
[01:19:25.294 --> 01:19:26.255]  Lindsey Williams comments.
[01:19:27.153 --> 01:19:28.374]  Yes, that's exactly right.
[01:19:28.494 --> 01:19:30.134]  In fact, you'll see them all over the country.
[01:19:32.616 --> 01:19:34.036]  So Sonny, I hope that answers your question.
[01:19:34.056 --> 01:19:34.617]  We're going to jump.
[01:19:35.357 --> 01:19:37.018]  Caleb in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:19:39.339 --> 01:19:40.259]  Hey guys, how's it going?
[01:19:40.559 --> 01:19:41.060]  Hi Caleb.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:41.940]  Hi.
[01:19:42.921 --> 01:19:48.323]  Back on January 29th, you had Jordan Maxwell on, and he was talking about the rising sun symbol.
[01:19:48.343 --> 01:19:48.403]  Yes.
[01:19:49.083 --> 01:19:53.986]  And I was just wondering what kind of progress you guys have been doing on the presentation he wants to do.
[01:19:54.858 --> 01:19:58.759]  You know, Jordan's a great guy and he wants to make a film with him and if I have the time I'll do that.
[01:19:58.779 --> 01:19:59.539]  I haven't even called him.
[01:19:59.859 --> 01:20:06.320]  I need to because look, I'm working all the time and I can only start one project and then finish that.
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:12.221]  A lot of folks out there, they always talk about projects and they always talk about I'm going to do this and that.
[01:20:12.261 --> 01:20:13.342]  When we do something, we do it.
[01:20:14.102 --> 01:20:19.703]  And so I've got to finish the Obama deception and then I have to gauge and decide whether
[01:20:21.909 --> 01:20:25.912]  The 2012 film I'm going to make is most important, or doing something with Jordan.
[01:20:26.332 --> 01:20:34.077]  Because also, I've told Jordan, write me a plan, tell me the film you want made, because, you know, he would be the director, or whatever you want to call it.
[01:20:34.277 --> 01:20:38.160]  And, you know, I need to call him to get that done.
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:41.742]  But no, I mean, no real progress has been made on that.
[01:20:42.542 --> 01:20:44.564]  Okay, I just thought that was, I mean, I love his work.
[01:20:44.624 --> 01:20:45.844]  It's just very interesting.
[01:20:45.905 --> 01:20:47.646]  I think it's very important to touch on that, too.
[01:20:47.686 --> 01:20:49.647]  But I got a question for Lindsey.
[01:20:50.605 --> 01:20:56.046]  Is the gas prices ever going to go sky high again, like $4 or $5 a gallon, or is it going to stay steady where it is?
[01:20:56.886 --> 01:21:10.790]  That's one of the things that I ask this individual who called me, who knows everything that goes on behind closed doors, and I gather from what he said that you can expect gasoline prices at the pump to stay approximately where they are right now, or lower, for at least a year to a year and a half.
[01:21:12.130 --> 01:21:17.371]  I know that's completely different than what the speculators are saying, but there again,
[01:21:18.391 --> 01:21:26.218]  It was $147 a barrel when they told me it was going to $50 a barrel and all the speculators lost that shirt because they were betting on the futures.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.722]  But all I can do is tell you what the elite have told me.
[01:21:29.742 --> 01:21:32.164]  So we're talking about at least another year of this.
[01:21:32.605 --> 01:21:33.285]  Anything else, Scholar?
[01:21:33.325 --> 01:21:37.710]  Just that I love your show and I watch it every day and keep up the good work.
[01:21:38.556 --> 01:21:39.576]  You too, my friend.
[01:21:39.596 --> 01:21:41.337]  Good to have you on board with us.
[01:21:41.377 --> 01:21:43.038]  Please spread the word about the transmission.
[01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:44.918]  That is the key.
[01:21:45.459 --> 01:21:47.039]  Infowars.com is the website.
[01:21:47.339 --> 01:21:48.160]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:48.680]  Stay with us.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:50.861]  We're on the march.
[01:21:51.381 --> 01:21:52.962]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:53.902 --> 01:21:56.583]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:04.635]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.
[01:22:04.935 --> 01:22:10.740]  Right now at MainMilitary.com you'll find savings on the top must-have military supplies.
[01:22:11.121 --> 01:22:13.102]  M10 gas masks for $12 or 3 for $30.
[01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:14.183]  Gas mask hoods $4 or 3 for $10.
[01:22:14.704 --> 01:22:15.705]  Mask filters $6 or 3 for $15.
[01:22:15.745 --> 01:22:17.306]  Save big on British chemical suits only $12.
[01:22:17.346 --> 01:22:17.767]  Israeli gas masks $20.
[01:22:24.833 --> 01:22:25.774]  Trigger finger gloves.
[01:22:25.894 --> 01:22:28.217]  Five dollars a pair or thirty six dollars a dozen.
[01:22:28.477 --> 01:22:31.601]  Snowshoe binding for eight dollars or forty eight dollars a dozen.
[01:22:31.801 --> 01:22:32.822]  And so much more.
[01:22:33.102 --> 01:22:34.884]  Even hard to find surplus items.
[01:22:35.185 --> 01:22:36.526]  All at surplus prices.
[01:22:36.827 --> 01:22:39.630]  Preparing the whole family has never been so affordable.
[01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:44.172]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:45.913]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:09.335 --> 01:23:10.395]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:10.875 --> 01:23:11.396]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:11.676 --> 01:23:12.636]  This is his ammo.
[01:23:12.656 --> 01:23:13.956]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:13.976 --> 01:23:15.717]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:16.037 --> 01:23:22.799]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:23.179 --> 01:23:23.619]  Some U.S.
[01:23:23.679 --> 01:23:29.301]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:30.021 --> 01:23:33.504]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:33.524 --> 01:23:36.326]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:23:59.696 --> 01:24:08.101]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:24:08.401 --> 01:24:14.085]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[01:24:14.385 --> 01:24:20.909]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:24.752]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:24:24.872 --> 01:24:27.133]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:24:27.333 --> 01:24:33.695]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[01:24:33.915 --> 01:24:37.236]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[01:24:37.436 --> 01:24:41.297]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[01:24:44.498 --> 01:24:47.439]  The body will react and heal itself, given the proper nutrition.
[01:24:47.659 --> 01:24:49.719]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.

[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:58.540]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[01:25:00.801 --> 01:25:03.541]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:25:03.561 --> 01:25:07.462]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:25:09.782 --> 01:25:12.503]  That's right, ramming the enemy at point-blank range.
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.740]  Because we don't have a choice.
[01:25:15.361 --> 01:25:16.141]  Fully committed.
[01:25:16.441 --> 01:25:21.843]  It's a great feeling going into these dark times that we're head up against it, not backing down.
[01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:25.704]  That's better than cowering and waiting for the new world or wolves to tear our guts out.
[01:25:26.424 --> 01:25:29.205]  We may go down, but not without a fight.
[01:25:31.166 --> 01:25:34.647]  We're going to go back to Lindsey Williams, take a few final phone calls from him in just a moment.
[01:25:35.107 --> 01:25:38.948]  But first, I want to tell you about some of the sponsors that have made this transmission today possible.
[01:25:39.408 --> 01:25:41.349]  They're the best sponsors out there, bar none.
[01:25:42.875 --> 01:25:53.468]  A lot of folks claiming that they've got high quality storable food out there, but I know this, the people I trust, the J. Michael Stevens group and their website, efoodsdirect.com, that's the letter, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:25:54.562 --> 01:25:57.923]  Big banners up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:25:58.223 --> 01:26:00.503]  They've got a special going for only a few more weeks.
[01:26:00.904 --> 01:26:03.284]  It's the 3-Day First Responder.
[01:26:04.144 --> 01:26:10.246]  And it is a 3-day food supply for one person in a very small package because it's dehydrated.
[01:26:10.406 --> 01:26:11.146]  High quality.
[01:26:11.186 --> 01:26:13.266]  It's a good sample of what they have to offer.
[01:26:14.087 --> 01:26:16.287]  Just check out their website, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:26:16.647 --> 01:26:20.528]  The best prices last more than 10 years, 15, 20 in climate controlled.
[01:26:21.028 --> 01:26:23.469]  10 years non-climate controlled like I have in my garage.
[01:26:24.389 --> 01:26:25.630]  An attic, I've got so much food.
[01:26:25.650 --> 01:26:30.553]  I mean, this is where I've bought a lot of food over the years and seven years ago I found these folks and they're the best.
[01:26:31.033 --> 01:26:32.634]  So, efoodsdirect.com or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:32.754]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:26:32.774 --> 01:26:34.675]  Go watch the free videos and information up on their site.
[01:26:34.695 --> 01:26:35.916]  Definitely spend some time on that.
[01:26:43.627 --> 01:26:48.412]  Also, another great sponsor is a Cola Blue, and that's what I've been drinking here today.
[01:26:48.852 --> 01:26:54.637]  We have a Cola Blue at my house in the garage, and we have a Cola Blue here in the office.
[01:26:55.518 --> 01:26:59.802]  And they come in red, green, white, red, blue, silver.
[01:27:00.383 --> 01:27:01.684]  They have hot water, cold water.
[01:27:01.704 --> 01:27:02.885]  It goes through seven filters.
[01:27:02.965 --> 01:27:06.888]  Once it grabs it out of the air, I've gotten some weird emails going, but it's dehydrated water.
[01:27:07.649 --> 01:27:08.270]  There's no such thing.
[01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:09.931]  It dehydrates the air.
[01:27:10.011 --> 01:27:11.352]  It grabs water out of the air.
[01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:16.836]  It's regular water, and it's just super, super good, and I love it, and I drink it.
[01:27:17.156 --> 01:27:18.497]  Acolabloo.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-O-O.com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[01:27:18.537 --> 01:27:19.718]  Call and get a free brochure.
[01:27:27.964 --> 01:27:29.745]  That's the best atmospheric water generator out there.
[01:27:29.765 --> 01:27:31.266]  We found bar none at a great price.
[01:27:31.286 --> 01:27:36.409]  800-691-6043 or acolablue.com.
[01:27:36.509 --> 01:27:48.176]  Okay, Lindsay, before we go back and run through five or six final calls quickly, tell folks, you're now, because this is moving so fast, doing monthly DVD updates, and you've got some of your books and things as well available.
[01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:52.019]  I hope folks take advantage of it so they can spread the word to others, not just from this show.
[01:27:52.819 --> 01:27:56.782]  Certainly, PrisonPlanet.tv members can take the interview we've done and get that out.
[01:27:56.802 --> 01:28:03.828]  I know they are, but for in-depth, where you're not interrupted by ads or callers or myself, tell folks the numbers so they can call and get that.
[01:28:04.849 --> 01:28:07.031]  Alex, things have progressed so fast.
[01:28:07.211 --> 01:28:11.435]  They've accelerated so rapidly that I'm actually preparing weekly now.
[01:28:12.055 --> 01:28:13.456]  This is almost unbelievable.
[01:28:13.636 --> 01:28:15.578]  I've never had things happen so quickly.
[01:28:15.598 --> 01:28:18.000]  This past weekend, folks, I plead with you.
[01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:20.054]  I have never done anything like this.
[01:28:20.114 --> 01:28:20.955]  This past weekend.
[01:28:21.035 --> 01:28:22.195]  It's never gone out to anyone.
[01:28:22.235 --> 01:28:24.857]  This is the first time that anyone will ever receive it.
[01:28:25.337 --> 01:28:26.878]  Is right now you're hearing about it.
[01:28:27.358 --> 01:28:27.939]  Prophecy.
[01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:28.819]  That's correct.
[01:28:29.459 --> 01:28:30.100]  Everything.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.681]  Okay, you've got to know about the Baltic Dry Index.
[01:28:32.841 --> 01:28:33.742]  I plead with you.
[01:28:33.882 --> 01:28:41.726]  Know the depth of how we could pay off one half of the national debt from our own soil in Dakotas, North and South Dakota, Montana.
[01:28:42.127 --> 01:28:43.968]  You've got to hear all of this.
[01:28:44.268 --> 01:28:47.690]  One hour presentation I did this past weekend entitled Prophecy.
[01:28:48.143 --> 01:28:50.065]  You must get my emergency update.
[01:28:50.405 --> 01:28:52.567]  This was prepared only two weekends ago.
[01:28:52.787 --> 01:28:53.628]  It's brand new.
[01:28:54.249 --> 01:28:56.991]  One hour and 30 minutes of everything.
[01:28:57.111 --> 01:28:57.892]  I deal with Europe.
[01:28:58.272 --> 01:28:59.093]  I deal with Russia.
[01:28:59.493 --> 01:29:01.195]  I deal with what's happening to the Arabs.
[01:29:01.535 --> 01:29:07.420]  I talk about every single one of the issues you've heard off today on Alex's show, plus much, much more.
[01:29:07.761 --> 01:29:09.022]  It could take four hours.
[01:29:09.342 --> 01:29:11.424]  My Energy Non-Crisis DVD.
[01:29:11.464 --> 01:29:13.646]  You watch it on your television at home.
[01:29:14.136 --> 01:29:17.738]  Another one entitled The Next 12 Months 2009.
[01:29:18.138 --> 01:29:21.480]  It is a DVD of 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:30.305]  You've got 5 hours of viewing and listening on DVD and CD, whether you want to do it in your car or in your home television set.
[01:29:30.745 --> 01:29:33.667]  I beg of you, for the sake of your dinner table, 800-321-2900.
[01:29:33.687 --> 01:29:38.149]  Ask for either one of the two packages we have.
[01:29:38.169 --> 01:29:39.090]  The number is 800-321-2900.
[01:29:43.764 --> 01:29:51.528]  800-321-2900 and you will be the first one to ever receive prophecy.
[01:29:51.708 --> 01:29:52.989]  I have never done this before.
[01:29:53.169 --> 01:29:54.650]  Now, this is coming from a minister.
[01:29:54.910 --> 01:30:00.833]  Give the number again.
[01:30:00.853 --> 01:30:01.874]  800-321-2900.
[01:30:01.914 --> 01:30:03.675]  Now, the lines may be busy.
[01:30:03.835 --> 01:30:07.897]  I'm sure from Alex Jones Show, last week they were busy for two days straight.
[01:30:07.977 --> 01:30:09.118]  Please keep calling.
[01:30:09.498 --> 01:30:10.038]  The number is 800-321-2900.
[01:30:14.183 --> 01:30:14.383]  2-9-0-0.
[01:30:15.043 --> 01:30:18.224]  OK, Lindsey, let's rush through some final calls here.
[01:30:18.244 --> 01:30:24.125]  I hope folks will get your material and educate others in their area because the only thing that will stop this is information waking folks up.
[01:30:24.465 --> 01:30:25.566]  John, I've got so many calls here.
[01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:26.166]  Who's up next?
[01:30:28.266 --> 01:30:28.906]  John in Canada.
[01:30:28.926 --> 01:30:30.387]  We've got to move quick, Pastor.
[01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:32.167]  John in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:30:32.207 --> 01:30:32.587]  Go ahead.
[01:30:33.067 --> 01:30:34.288]  Hello, Alex and Lindsey.
[01:30:34.308 --> 01:30:35.088]  It's an honor to talk with you.
[01:30:35.788 --> 01:30:36.148]  Hi, John.
[01:30:37.184 --> 01:30:41.006]  Basically, my question is regarding the economic situation in regards to Canada.
[01:30:41.766 --> 01:30:44.327]  How do you see it playing out here in Canada?
[01:30:44.587 --> 01:30:57.312]  Well, within the past week's time, this thing has become global, to the point that they're just talking about what's going to happen in Europe, what's happening in Russia, close down the stock market, currency exchange yesterday, China, Japan, Dubai.
[01:30:57.713 --> 01:31:00.134]  You see, Canada will not escape.
[01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:05.656]  It'll be the identical same thing we're talking about for the rest of the world, because you're connected with the British Empire.
[01:31:07.332 --> 01:31:12.596]  Yeah, the globalists did this so they could globally bring everybody down at once and set up their world government.
[01:31:12.616 --> 01:31:22.843]  And Canada is so oil-dependent that by the price being driven down to $33 a barrel right now, even at $50, it's not economically viable to pull out that oil shale.
[01:31:22.883 --> 01:31:23.923]  Correct, Lindsey?
[01:31:24.544 --> 01:31:25.064]  That's correct.
[01:31:25.084 --> 01:31:26.925]  You can't even pay for oil shale anymore.
[01:31:26.945 --> 01:31:28.667]  Canada would be paying people to take it.
[01:31:29.087 --> 01:31:32.389]  So with this price, Canada is not exempt whatsoever.
[01:31:32.549 --> 01:31:33.370]  Get ready.
[01:31:35.868 --> 01:31:36.348]  Another question.
[01:31:37.108 --> 01:31:40.470]  I was absolutely floored when you predicted the conflict with Russia.
[01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:47.312]  And then, you know, a couple months later, we had NATO forces... That's right, we forgot he predicted that!
[01:31:48.172 --> 01:31:53.834]  Yeah, and I was just wondering, do you see that conflict escalating, or is there going to be some other conflict that's going to rise?
[01:31:54.094 --> 01:31:54.714]  Positively.
[01:31:54.794 --> 01:31:57.375]  Right now, Russia is in a collapsing position.
[01:31:57.755 --> 01:32:00.096]  They'll do what they've done with every nation, they'll collapse it.
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.281]  Then if they want to bring it back, they will.
[01:32:02.341 --> 01:32:12.326]  And I was told by this individual a few months ago that Russia will be one of the greatest powers on the face of the Earth in the future, so that means that they're going to revive them once they get through breaking them.
[01:32:12.886 --> 01:32:13.687]  All right, that's all I had.
[01:32:13.707 --> 01:32:14.707]  Thanks so much, guys.
[01:32:15.307 --> 01:32:16.948]  Yeah, Russia kicked out the robber barons.
[01:32:16.988 --> 01:32:20.870]  Now they've got to be brought to ground here.
[01:32:21.651 --> 01:32:22.191]  Good call.
[01:32:22.431 --> 01:32:25.953]  Brian in Florida, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[01:32:25.993 --> 01:32:26.233]  Go ahead.
[01:32:30.026 --> 01:32:30.886]  I've got a question for Lindsey.
[01:32:30.906 --> 01:32:32.887]  There's 30 some states that want to secede from the union.
[01:32:41.347 --> 01:32:48.770]  What's keeping them from going ahead and getting all the oil they want over in North Dakota and Montana and getting our own money?
[01:32:49.491 --> 01:32:58.355]  Because by blowing out the economy, they've made it too expensive to now explore and get that oil that they know is there to then bring it to market.
[01:32:58.395 --> 01:32:59.495]  That's the whole point.
[01:32:59.535 --> 01:32:59.855]  Lindsey?
[01:33:00.896 --> 01:33:06.018]  Yes, within a few days after the Montana legislator reading this into the congressional record,
[01:33:06.721 --> 01:33:12.244]  These scoundrels, they actually put up a bill before Congress not to allow any drilling in that area.
[01:33:12.604 --> 01:33:15.426]  This is... We have been betrayed.
[01:33:17.087 --> 01:33:18.788]  It's a global game of risk.
[01:33:18.848 --> 01:33:19.789]  Anything else, Dan?
[01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:23.871]  No, that's the most... I wonder why people don't go ahead and get the oil themselves.
[01:33:23.891 --> 01:33:26.413]  Because they won't give you the permits.
[01:33:26.453 --> 01:33:28.054]  They won't give you the permits in Alaska.
[01:33:28.414 --> 01:33:29.935]  They won't give you the permits in the Dakotas.
[01:33:29.955 --> 01:33:31.836]  They won't give you the permits in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:33:32.356 --> 01:33:35.118]  The thing is, they can do it if they want to or not, Canty.
[01:33:35.871 --> 01:33:36.471]  Yeah, they should.
[01:33:36.491 --> 01:33:37.152]  The state should.
[01:33:37.732 --> 01:33:38.152]  Go ahead, Lindsey.
[01:33:38.912 --> 01:33:48.177]  Yeah, I was told by this individual a few months ago that they were not going to allow any major production in the United States of America anymore, that we would be kept obligated to foreign oil.
[01:33:48.417 --> 01:33:50.958]  The elite are doing it right through Congress and our president.
[01:33:51.478 --> 01:33:51.959]  Yes, thanks, Luke.
[01:33:51.979 --> 01:33:52.859]  Go ahead, Luke.
[01:33:52.899 --> 01:33:55.200]  I like how the states tell them to get lost and go ahead and do it.
[01:33:56.401 --> 01:33:56.781]  I hear you.
[01:33:57.001 --> 01:33:57.261]  Thank you.
[01:33:57.701 --> 01:33:58.282]  Thank you, Dan.
[01:33:59.102 --> 01:34:00.143]  Warren in Michigan.
[01:34:00.183 --> 01:34:01.183]  Warren, you're on the air.
[01:34:02.984 --> 01:34:03.224]  Thanks.
[01:34:03.484 --> 01:34:05.105]  I'd like to thank both of you for everything.
[01:34:05.558 --> 01:34:06.198]  How are you doing?
[01:34:06.218 --> 01:34:17.965]  Lindsey, I saw Energy Non-Crisis, and in that you allude to a date in the coming months where the market would be flooded with oil that could only be denominated in Euros.
[01:34:18.485 --> 01:34:20.347]  Does that still hold to be true?
[01:34:21.127 --> 01:34:25.249]  Yes, this individual said to me that they were going to open up two major oil fields in the world.
[01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:30.092]  Alex spoke of them a few moments ago, the one north of Russia and another one in Indonesia.
[01:34:32.168 --> 01:34:35.490]  The price of crude oil begins to go back up again, which it may.
[01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:37.872]  You know, even they have an alternative plan.
[01:34:38.252 --> 01:34:43.115]  If it tries to go back up, they're going to bring on these two oil fields in order to crash it back down to where it is now.
[01:34:44.576 --> 01:34:44.856]  Okay.
[01:34:46.537 --> 01:34:54.843]  And let me add a key piece of information to all this from just Texas and Illinois and Oklahoma.
[01:34:55.563 --> 01:34:59.346]  They have found tens of thousands of huge oil and gas wells.
[01:35:00.424 --> 01:35:01.365]  And this has even been in the news.
[01:35:01.385 --> 01:35:02.566]  There's been lawsuits over this.
[01:35:02.586 --> 01:35:05.207]  It even happened with Clayton Williams, big Texas oil guy.
[01:35:05.488 --> 01:35:06.528]  He's still a small player.
[01:35:06.548 --> 01:35:07.029]  He's private.
[01:35:08.530 --> 01:35:16.335]  They go in, drill giant wells, find the gas and oil, and then they cap them, and the oil company says, or they pump out, you know, 1% of pressure.
[01:35:19.051 --> 01:35:32.419]  And they wait with it, just like you notice oil prices have gone down by more than two-thirds from $147 plus a barrel to $33, but still it hasn't dropped that much comparatively to what it should have.
[01:35:32.439 --> 01:35:35.921]  It should be down at this price at $1.30 or so, but here in Texas it's $2.
[01:35:37.001 --> 01:35:43.045]  Because the refineries were bought up by the big oil companies in the 90s, this has been in the Associated Press, to artificially
[01:35:44.045 --> 01:35:46.066]  Not allow enough gasoline to come to market.
[01:35:46.146 --> 01:35:54.171]  So, what the oil companies have said here in Texas, is that if it ever did go up again, they can drive it right back down again.
[01:35:54.191 --> 01:35:58.533]  You know, let's say the Arabs decided to cut it off years ago, they just turn on all these wells they've got.
[01:36:00.734 --> 01:36:01.835]  See how they've got every angle?
[01:36:01.855 --> 01:36:02.835]  They already have a solution ready.
[01:36:03.156 --> 01:36:05.337]  Yeah, they have, exactly, they have every angle covered.
[01:36:06.718 --> 01:36:14.104]  Only by politically saying you're a pack of robber baron, monopoly criminals, and taking control of the government, having them arrested, could we ever stop this?
[01:36:14.164 --> 01:36:15.305]  That's the only solution.
[01:36:15.545 --> 01:36:22.511]  They rule finance, they rule energy, they rule military, they rule media, but they're not invincible.
[01:36:22.551 --> 01:36:24.192]  Look at how the mainstream media is imploding.
[01:36:24.232 --> 01:36:30.557]  So now the New York Times, the Toronto Star, the BBC is all announcing they're going to start shutting the web down.
[01:36:30.737 --> 01:36:31.898]  They're saying it.
[01:36:32.739 --> 01:36:36.343]  Because they're desperate because of what we are doing here and others.
[01:36:36.984 --> 01:36:39.386]  We have a small window to kick their butts.
[01:36:39.767 --> 01:36:40.688]  Lindsey, do you agree with that?
[01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:42.650]  Oh, the masses.
[01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.931]  That's the only hope.
[01:36:44.172 --> 01:36:50.619]  And Alex Jones Show, folks, let me say it again, don't you miss Alex Jones Show one single day.
[01:36:50.973 --> 01:36:55.697]  You listen to him every day because things are happening so fast you have to keep up with it by 24 hours.
[01:36:56.097 --> 01:37:04.643]  And more than that, record these shows, save the podcast, start your own shows, because they can kill me or shut me up or imprison me, and believe me, they've been threatening it.
[01:37:05.724 --> 01:37:09.547]  This is a message, not about a person, and so just get the info out.
[01:37:09.847 --> 01:37:10.908]  A few final calls here.
[01:37:11.908 --> 01:37:13.249]  Let's talk to Tom in Kentucky.
[01:37:13.269 --> 01:37:14.110]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:37:15.871 --> 01:37:16.132]  Hello?
[01:37:16.572 --> 01:37:16.872]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:17.713 --> 01:37:18.113]  Hi, Tom.
[01:37:18.153 --> 01:37:19.294]  Nice to speak to you, too.
[01:37:20.838 --> 01:37:38.005]  I don't know if this has any bearing on anything, but July 24th after Barack Obama's speech in Berlin, I watched him come out the rear of the building, and him and one reporter and one cameraman only, and he stated, what was the purpose of your speech?
[01:37:38.085 --> 01:37:46.128]  And he said, so Christians, Jews, and Muslims can worship as they choose together, because I'm a Muslim.
[01:37:46.168 --> 01:37:47.929]  He repeated that question two times.
[01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:52.232]  Do you think that that will have any effect on how he governs our country?
[01:37:53.753 --> 01:37:54.894]  It's already having effect.
[01:37:54.994 --> 01:37:56.455]  Look at the bill he signed yesterday.
[01:37:57.016 --> 01:38:01.639]  And he made the statement, he said, I was elected president, I will drop the bill the way I want it.
[01:38:02.359 --> 01:38:10.164]  Well, it's disgusting for him to, the very next day, run a reporter down who asked him to admit that he was a Muslim man.
[01:38:10.704 --> 01:38:13.926]  And also one last point about how to prepare.
[01:38:13.946 --> 01:38:16.148]  I was told by a gun store owner,
[01:38:16.670 --> 01:38:20.834]  That people need to start vacuum sealing ammunition and guns.
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:38.561]  Lindsay Williams, we've got to end it right there.
[01:38:38.621 --> 01:38:44.203]  If I have time, I'm going to get to a few of these final callers, but I want to thank you for spending time with us.
[01:38:44.243 --> 01:38:45.384]  And so much has developed.
[01:38:45.524 --> 01:38:59.931]  As this develops, let's just set you up to come on the show, if you've got the time, at least every two weeks for an hour, to give us updates as all this unfolds and as you do more research and integrate it with the inside information you have that integrates with all of my inside information.
[01:39:00.411 --> 01:39:04.853]  Again, I just want to thank you so much for spending time with us and joining us.
[01:39:05.791 --> 01:39:14.063]  I consider it a privilege to be with you, Alex, and again, folks, if you want this week, 800-321-2900, but don't you miss Alex Jones Show every day in between.
[01:39:20.305 --> 01:39:20.725]  Thank you.
[01:39:21.026 --> 01:39:21.967]  You better take care, my friend.
[01:39:21.987 --> 01:39:22.707]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:39:23.088 --> 01:39:29.694]  You know, you'd think I'd be excited to have been right about all this, to have millions of people starting to tune in, to have the show exploding.
[01:39:29.914 --> 01:39:30.835]  I'm upset every day.
[01:39:30.935 --> 01:39:33.938]  I almost cry when I'm with my wife late at night.
[01:39:34.879 --> 01:39:36.780]  These are psycho criminals that are in control.
[01:39:37.481 --> 01:39:42.644]  I mean, there's not even any pleasure in the fact that we've been successful, because what are we successful in?
[01:39:42.704 --> 01:39:46.466]  Pointing that a freight train's coming to run us over, and all these blind people couldn't see it?
[01:39:47.106 --> 01:39:50.608]  I mean, there's no more time to screw around and play games, folks.
[01:39:51.408 --> 01:40:01.434]  They're openly announcing world government to rule everything, and a World Central Bank that you'll pay carbon taxes to, and money transfer taxes to, and bankrupting everything, so you're beholden to the government.
[01:40:02.844 --> 01:40:04.405]  This is nightmarish!
[01:40:04.745 --> 01:40:06.187]  Please get the word out.
[01:40:06.627 --> 01:40:07.528]  Please say no.
[01:40:07.808 --> 01:40:10.670]  People are really waking up right now, and that's the silver lining in all of this.
[01:40:12.331 --> 01:40:15.514]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up, because they're nationalizing the banks.
[01:40:15.814 --> 01:40:16.654]  They're not really doing that.
[01:40:16.674 --> 01:40:20.037]  They're handing them over to foreign private banks' controls through government power.
[01:40:21.038 --> 01:40:24.961]  Gold has gone up 15-plus dollars.
[01:40:26.291 --> 01:40:26.771]  What's it at?
[01:40:27.151 --> 01:40:28.412]  Ted, what's the latest on gold?
[01:40:28.452 --> 01:40:29.493]  Last time I checked it was $979.
[01:40:29.533 --> 01:40:30.353]  Testing $1000.
[01:40:30.453 --> 01:40:31.214]  Yeah, right now it's $983.50.
[01:40:31.254 --> 01:40:32.234]  It's up $13 right now.
[01:40:32.274 --> 01:40:33.215]  Silver's up too.
[01:40:33.255 --> 01:40:34.115]  Silver's up to $14.36 an ounce.
[01:40:34.135 --> 01:40:35.236]  Alright, I want to be clear.
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:50.023]  Three weeks ago, two weeks ago, a week ago, you were offering gold that you bought at the $8.30 level in the market when the market was $9.15.
[01:40:50.463 --> 01:40:52.204]  That sold out last week.
[01:40:52.965 --> 01:40:58.828]  This week you said, folks, I bought at the $8.70 level and the $8.65 level when gold was at $9.50.
[01:41:00.089 --> 01:41:01.950]  But you said, folks, you better move quick.
[01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:03.431]  You have sold out of sovereigns.
[01:41:03.951 --> 01:41:05.472]  All you have at that level left.
[01:41:05.692 --> 01:41:11.497]  Well, it's just like you said, the francs are the only thing that I have left in the smaller denominational gold that I talked about yesterday.
[01:41:11.537 --> 01:41:12.437]  The British sovereigns did sell out.
[01:41:34.864 --> 01:41:36.706]  I did do a price check on them today.
[01:41:36.746 --> 01:41:43.171]  They're at $242 apiece now, and I'm still selling them for two days ago price at $221.
[01:41:43.371 --> 01:41:47.834]  Now gold is up right around $100 an ounce.
[01:41:47.914 --> 01:41:51.898]  These are up a little bit more than $100 an ounce when you multiply them by four.
[01:41:52.538 --> 01:42:02.206]  And then the mercury dimes and the walking liberty halves and the silver, it really hands down is the best buy that I have in the entire inventory because
[01:42:02.697 --> 01:42:13.761]  I bought this stuff when silver was trading there between that $9 and $10, and now that we're close to $15, there's almost been a 50% increase in the spot price.
[01:42:13.962 --> 01:42:20.584]  Let's be clear, if folks would have bought gold from you a few months ago, they would have gotten a 50% profit.
[01:42:20.984 --> 01:42:25.086]  Ladies and gentlemen, where else are profits like this being made?
[01:42:25.886 --> 01:42:29.048]  No, the stock market isn't offering us that for sure.
[01:42:29.108 --> 01:42:32.169]  Right now the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down again.
[01:42:32.677 --> 01:42:37.161]  The dollar's strong because people are flying to cash, fleeing to cash.
[01:42:37.321 --> 01:42:37.861]  Stay there, Ted.
[01:42:37.881 --> 01:42:40.684]  Let's do a final five minutes on the nationalization of the banks.
[01:42:40.704 --> 01:42:41.504]  I'm going to give you the number.
[01:42:42.285 --> 01:42:42.585]  Okay?
[01:42:42.625 --> 01:42:44.427]  And the coins are almost gone at that price.
[01:42:44.447 --> 01:42:45.007]  800-686-2237.
[01:42:45.027 --> 01:42:45.087]  800-686-2237.
[01:42:45.227 --> 01:42:47.970]  He has silver at almost $6 under an ounce, what it's selling for right now.
[01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:50.371]  He has gold at almost $100 under what it's selling for.
[01:42:59.719 --> 01:43:02.442]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[01:43:02.642 --> 01:43:03.743]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[01:43:03.763 --> 01:43:07.968]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[01:43:07.988 --> 01:43:12.532]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function, or are you simply treating the symptoms?
[01:43:12.772 --> 01:43:23.023]  The Sinuplus Elite Advanced Sinus Irrigation System effectively cleanses your sinuses and upper airways of all fungi, bacteria, and pathogens, and clears your sinuses gently and pleasantly.
[01:43:23.103 --> 01:43:23.603]  We're good to go.
[01:43:53.243 --> 01:43:54.204]  It is a big idea.
[01:43:54.364 --> 01:43:55.045]  A new world order.
[01:43:55.105 --> 01:43:58.929]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:43:58.969 --> 01:44:02.972]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:44:03.032 --> 01:44:07.216]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:44:07.236 --> 01:44:10.880]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:44:18.024 --> 01:44:25.362]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:44:28.379 --> 01:44:33.362]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:44:33.823 --> 01:44:37.305]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:44:37.685 --> 01:44:40.167]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[01:44:40.267 --> 01:44:41.408]  Most people have no idea.
[01:44:41.428 --> 01:44:42.208]  They're not after money.
[01:44:42.228 --> 01:44:43.289]  They have all the money they need.
[01:44:43.489 --> 01:44:44.210]  They're after power.
[01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:45.310]  That's what happens here.
[01:44:45.611 --> 01:44:53.856]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:54.336 --> 01:44:56.798]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:44:57.138 --> 01:44:58.219]  You have been warned.
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:07.126]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:45:07.286 --> 01:45:11.690]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:45:11.850 --> 01:45:16.374]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:45:16.534 --> 01:45:17.935]  It's a documented fact.
[01:45:18.796 --> 01:45:25.421]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[01:45:25.581 --> 01:45:37.410]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[01:45:37.671 --> 01:45:41.334]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[01:45:41.934 --> 01:45:44.336]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[01:45:45.076 --> 01:45:48.738]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.

[01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:52.300]  That's 888-949-3570.
[01:46:06.886 --> 01:46:10.968]  TheObamaDeception.net.
[01:46:11.248 --> 01:46:12.309]  Check out the new website.
[01:46:12.329 --> 01:46:14.810]  We launched it a few weeks ago, but we redesigned it.
[01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:16.831]  A lot more material and information up there.
[01:46:16.851 --> 01:46:17.972]  TheObamaDeception.net.
[01:46:18.352 --> 01:46:18.912]  Okay, Ted.
[01:46:20.973 --> 01:46:24.935]  You bought gold at $8.65, $8.70, the deals you did, in that range.
[01:46:25.856 --> 01:46:30.498]  You're now passing savings of over $100 an ounce on to people, and other places are sold out.
[01:46:31.058 --> 01:46:32.379]  You are nearing being sold out.
[01:46:32.639 --> 01:46:33.900]  You have to buy back into the market.
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:38.183]  And next time you buy in, what type of increases are we talking about?
[01:46:38.503 --> 01:46:43.088]  Well, like I said, on the frank right now, buying into the marketplace, I'm at $242.
[01:46:44.009 --> 01:46:48.212]  British Sovereigns, I sold out of my quantities that I had at $275.
[01:46:48.393 --> 01:46:49.314]  It's just gone.
[01:46:50.334 --> 01:46:56.240]  I will be looking, you know, I'll be offering some more in the future here, but it's going to be closer to the $300 level.
[01:46:58.132 --> 01:47:00.935]  The Merck Dimes, the Walking Liberty Haves, still.
[01:47:01.035 --> 01:47:03.659]  I mean, Alex, that's such a steal.
[01:47:03.699 --> 01:47:08.204]  We have some $20 gold pieces, some 10s, we have some U.S.
[01:47:08.264 --> 01:47:12.430]  Eagles, some of the few things that are still around that you can pick up, small quantities.
[01:47:12.630 --> 01:47:15.694]  I really can't say it on air because I just don't have enough to go around.
[01:47:16.611 --> 01:47:28.975]  So if you're interested in other products, that's fine too, but right now the gold market... The thing guaranteed at that price is the dimes, the half dollar silver, and the European, Swiss, and French gorgeous little francs.
[01:47:30.255 --> 01:47:31.675]  Ted, the number is 800-686-2237.
[01:47:31.695 --> 01:47:31.735]  800-686-2237.
[01:47:31.755 --> 01:47:34.356]  How long can you hold that deal on the francs?
[01:47:34.416 --> 01:47:37.277]  I'm going to hold this until midnight tonight.
[01:47:44.939 --> 01:47:48.261]  And we'll see how the supplies look tomorrow and what's going on in gold.
[01:47:48.701 --> 01:47:52.002]  But chances are you will not be able to buy this deal tomorrow.
[01:47:52.422 --> 01:47:57.505]  I know because my British Sovereign supply, I didn't have as many to start with.
[01:47:58.045 --> 01:47:59.906]  And then now they're gone, they've been sold out.
[01:48:00.546 --> 01:48:01.807]  The Franks are going to be the thing.
[01:48:01.827 --> 01:48:03.007]  I'm sure they'll go tonight.
[01:48:03.487 --> 01:48:09.670]  So if you call tonight, if you still call during today, before midnight central time,
[01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:11.484]  You can lock in on those francs at $2.21.
[01:48:11.524 --> 01:48:18.251]  By the way, quite a few times Ted has sold out and gone ahead and bought them for more and sold it to you at that price.
[01:48:18.291 --> 01:48:22.555]  So he's good for it, but Ted will probably end up losing a lot of money on this.
[01:48:22.895 --> 01:48:24.017]  Well, yep.
[01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:31.524]  But like I said, I'll stand fast to my word on those francs and the Walking Liberty halves and the Merck dimes.
[01:48:32.017 --> 01:48:37.764]  If you're looking for something, especially in that silver, I don't know why anybody would not take advantage of that silver deal.
[01:48:37.824 --> 01:48:38.665]  It's just so good.
[01:48:39.045 --> 01:48:41.388]  You got silver at like nine and a half bucks a piece.
[01:48:41.768 --> 01:48:43.390]  It's right at 15 right now.
[01:48:43.631 --> 01:48:46.374]  You're selling it to them at nine and a half dollars an ounce level.
[01:48:46.634 --> 01:48:48.296]  This is insane, folks.
[01:48:48.336 --> 01:48:50.479]  I mean, I feel like I should do a Crazy Eddie commercial.
[01:48:50.919 --> 01:48:51.499]  Crazy!
[01:48:51.519 --> 01:48:53.081]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:48:53.101 --> 01:48:53.641]  800-686-2237.
[01:48:53.661 --> 01:48:53.701]  800-686-2237.
[01:48:55.462 --> 01:49:00.026]  They're taking over, Ted.
[01:49:00.066 --> 01:49:01.587]  They're saying, nationalize the banks.
[01:49:01.867 --> 01:49:08.953]  But that really means, because all power to the Treasury has been given to the Federal Reserve, that means foreign global banks are now taking control of the United States.
[01:49:09.413 --> 01:49:14.497]  No, we're just, I mean, what's left of the Constitution is just being shredded and burned right now.
[01:49:14.577 --> 01:49:16.758]  I mean, it drives me crazy, Alex.
[01:49:16.839 --> 01:49:18.660]  I hear that and I read about the same stuff.
[01:49:19.238 --> 01:49:24.843]  And I don't think half the people out here in the United States even understand what that means to them.
[01:49:25.131 --> 01:49:27.532]  I mean, we're going to be answering to a foreign power now.
[01:49:28.372 --> 01:49:28.952]  What do you think?
[01:49:29.012 --> 01:49:34.113]  I mean, do you think we'll have... We already do on NAFTA and GAD and the World Trade Organization and the IMF, the World Bank.
[01:49:34.133 --> 01:49:38.554]  Now it's just public and it's happening, so at least people should protect themselves.
[01:49:39.274 --> 01:49:44.095]  You know, folks, you could have bought silver three or four months ago, two months ago, and gotten almost a 50% increase.
[01:49:44.395 --> 01:49:46.376]  I mean, what was silver a few months ago?
[01:49:46.396 --> 01:49:47.436]  Wasn't it like six bucks an ounce?
[01:49:47.776 --> 01:49:50.616]  It was, well, no, it did drop down to about nine.
[01:49:50.957 --> 01:49:52.977]  We didn't see six this last time around.
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:58.503]  It certainly was a lot lower than it is today, and I don't see it coming back down again, Alex.
[01:49:58.963 --> 01:49:59.543]  Absolutely.
[01:49:59.603 --> 01:50:00.904]  So, 800-686-2237.
[01:50:02.145 --> 01:50:05.427]  The Franks and the Silver have dollars and dimes.
[01:50:05.447 --> 01:50:05.627]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:05.687 --> 01:50:09.669]  And they'll be there until midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:50:09.969 --> 01:50:11.770]  Pet Anderson, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:12.831]  Yeah, thanks for having me up.
[01:50:14.082 --> 01:50:17.003]  Oh, what a wild ride today.
[01:50:17.043 --> 01:50:19.104]  We'll be back tomorrow live, 11 to 3 p.m.
[01:50:19.144 --> 01:50:19.464]  Central.
[01:50:19.484 --> 01:50:20.985]  Please spread the word about the transmission.
[01:50:21.245 --> 01:50:23.346]  Don't forget, the Obama Deception is now available.
[01:50:23.866 --> 01:50:33.590]  And I covered some of Obama's big lies in the first hour of the show, and that'll be retransmitting at InfoWars.com right now, after this 72nd break.
[01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:36.611]  So we'll be right back for everybody at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:36.891 --> 01:50:37.952]  God bless you all.
[01:50:38.332 --> 01:50:39.412]  Keep fighting the new world order.
[01:50:41.253 --> 01:50:42.954]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:48.213]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:49.694 --> 01:50:51.275]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:51.395 --> 01:50:55.979]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:56.139 --> 01:50:58.881]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:59.102 --> 01:51:01.964]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:02.144 --> 01:51:06.868]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:07.088 --> 01:51:07.989]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:08.210 --> 01:51:11.134]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
