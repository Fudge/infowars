[00:00:01.472 --> 00:00:06.521]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:09.166]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:19.603]  We are streaming live over at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:23.908]  Remember, you can see me at PrisonPlanet.TV three hours a night, five nights a week.
[00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:25.950]  It's the InfoWarrior with Jason Burmess.
[00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:30.375]  And believe it or not, they actually put a camera on me for the full three hours.
[00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:33.158]  I think I do a little more TV than even Jones does during the week.
[00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.364]  I just want to give a big up to Alex for giving me the opportunity to do my own show, my own thing.
[00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:42.607]  Again, thank all the affiliates out there that are picking us up.
[00:00:43.447 --> 00:00:52.455]  If you want to pick us up on the micros or what else they got there, the shortwaves and the AM and the FM's, it's affiliates at GCNlive.com.
[00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:53.216]  Get at them quick.
[00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:55.778]  We want to reach as many people as possible and expand.
[00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:57.900]  As big as we can.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.106]  Before we go to your callers, and I want to do a little bit of news, a little tech news before we go to the callers.
[00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:07.630]  I want to thank one of our sponsors, My Solar Backup, MySolarBackup.com.
[00:01:08.632 --> 00:01:11.073]  The number is 877-327-0365.
[00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:15.815]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:19.276]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:20.797]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:25.299]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:31.421]  A solar-powered generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:41.410]  It's designed to provide 1800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:50.497]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[00:01:50.537 --> 00:01:53.339]  That's right, it generates free electricity.
[00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:55.420]  It's MySolarBackup.com 877-327-0365.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.801]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:20.994]  Alright, so the tech news that I wanted to hit upon is there's this documentary filmmaker out there and he was trying to do something to expose the surveillance society and he came across this technology now where he plans to put a mini camera in his prosthetic eye.
[00:02:21.014 --> 00:02:29.616]  I guess the guy has a falsie and right now the technology, the camera looks like it's basically
[00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:33.007]  A contact lens with a transmitter on it.
[00:02:33.207 --> 00:02:38.972]  Now, everything's wireless, so this camera isn't going from his eye socket and a wire and whatever.
[00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:41.114]  It's being transmitted.
[00:02:41.134 --> 00:02:43.996]  So now we're at the point where we can put something into our eyeball.
[00:02:44.317 --> 00:02:48.180]  It can record everything wirelessly.
[00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:50.162]  Now, here's the thing.
[00:02:51.124 --> 00:02:55.806]  Police officers could be using this as a tool within the next 10 to 20 years.
[00:02:56.106 --> 00:03:09.172]  Alright, that means as soon as they knock on your door and you say, you know, you can't come in, you don't have a warrant, they say, well, you know what, you acted suspicious, it's on the cam, and then they scan your house and even if they don't pick up something right away, everything will be analyzed.
[00:03:09.813 --> 00:03:12.594]  Or, look at another nightmare scenario.
[00:03:13.054 --> 00:03:14.455]  Say that you do commit a crime,
[00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:16.871]  And you're on probation.
[00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:31.755]  But they offer you, well, you can go to jail, or instead of probation, we're just going to fit you, you know, instead of with a lojack, in other words, house arrest, you're going to have to have this iCam, and it's just going to record everything you do to a database, and as long as you don't break the law, everything's going to be good.
[00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:35.536]  This technology, I mean, nanotech is here, folks.
[00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:37.837]  Everything is getting smaller.
[00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:42.058]  You can check this out over at iBorgBlog.com.
[00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:43.198]  It's the real deal.
[00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:45.814]  And it is scary.
[00:03:46.114 --> 00:03:47.015]  I mean, oh man.
[00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:52.121]  At one end of me, I'm like a tech head, and I think, cool, man.
[00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:54.843]  This is great for journalists like myself.
[00:03:54.924 --> 00:03:59.028]  You know, just throw it up in my eye, and I'll be able to get whatever I want, and this is the new thing.
[00:03:59.068 --> 00:04:04.614]  But when you look at bugging technology, I mean, you'll never know if someone's a tattletail or a rat ever again.
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.720]  Hey!
[00:04:34.704 --> 00:04:43.849]  After the program, I would like you to go to Chick.com, like the baby chicken, C-H-I-C-K, and read about the ex-Jesuit priest Alberto Rivera.
[00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:44.950]  It's a six-part series.
[00:04:44.990 --> 00:05:02.499]  He was an intelligence officer in the Vatican for 27 years and became a fundamentalist Christian, and he exposes the whole Vatican deal, the whole religious system, from the charismatic movement to the... He talks about the Seventh-Day Adventists, the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Mormons, how the Jesuits formed everything, and further into the
[00:05:03.314 --> 00:05:14.725]  It's a series that shows how the Islamic religion came out of the, originated with the Vatican, with Warraquah and Khadijah, and they set up a Catholic girl up with the Muhammad.
[00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:15.906]  It's pretty interesting, but anyway.
[00:05:17.887 --> 00:05:25.014]  The Bible does say, calls the Roman Catholic institution, Mystery Babylon, Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.
[00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:33.976]  Things that I, we all know about the globalists and the Illuminati and everything, but the central control has always been the Roman Catholic institution under the Vatican.
[00:05:34.497 --> 00:05:36.218]  They're the ones that control the Illuminati.
[00:05:36.398 --> 00:05:38.540]  So the Illuminati takes their orders from the Jesuits.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.362]  Well, you know, I think that's up for debate.
[00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:48.269]  I mean, that's kind of, I've heard that theory and then, you know, obviously people will say, oh, no, it's not the Jesuits, it's the Zionists and all this other stuff.
[00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:49.110]  But, you know, we had
[00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.091]  At least
[00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.754]  I don't know if it's the innermost ring.
[00:06:10.834 --> 00:06:11.855]  It's definitely up there.
[00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:15.078]  It controls, you know, religion itself controls the masses.
[00:06:15.398 --> 00:06:17.440]  And a lot of these guys do have Jesuit ties.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.765]  It's just like they, but they have other ties too, you know, like, I don't think you can come out and say, you know, the bohemian grove is Jesuit.
[00:06:23.805 --> 00:06:25.747]  Some people point to the St.
[00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:29.770]  John of Maplenuk statue there, but you look at him and he's, you know, given the shape of his body.
[00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.070]  Yes.
[00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:53.513]  You know, obviously the Jesuit order fits in there.
[00:06:53.553 --> 00:06:55.534]  I think the Zionist order fits in there as well.
[00:06:55.834 --> 00:06:58.156]  I just don't, I'm not sure what the innermost ring is.
[00:06:58.176 --> 00:07:03.119]  I don't know how you can come to that conclusion unless you are actually in that innermost circle.
[00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:04.160]  But I thank you for the call.
[00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:07.843]  Let's go to Abraham in Washington.
[00:07:07.863 --> 00:07:14.247]  And you know, this is kind of like, you know, although I do touch on all that stuff, I mean, in the last, like I said, three days, we've had all those guests on for an hour.
[00:07:14.327 --> 00:07:16.289]  We had Mark Dice of the Resistance Manifesto.
[00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:19.071]  We went into, you know, this occult stuff.
[00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:22.006]  We try to keep it as secular as possible.
[00:07:22.306 --> 00:07:32.649]  You know, this has been a pretty big news blitz without any of that kind of, you know, which is very valid, don't get me wrong, but religion stuff, you know, occultic stuff.
[00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:35.050]  We're talking more about technology today.
[00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:42.052]  You know, Obama's meeting with, you know, who Bob Chapman feels is the head of the European Illuminati, or at least the one that
[00:07:43.732 --> 00:07:44.373]  Hey Jason, how's it going today?
[00:07:44.393 --> 00:07:48.016]  I just wanted to congratulate you on the new show and I had a couple of points I wanted to make real quick if I could.
[00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:19.101]  Um, well, first of all, I don't know if you guys have heard about it, but the FDIC announced that they wanted $500 billion, or they're going to stop insuring the banks.
[00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:21.502]  That was in the Wall Street Journal today, or yesterday, actually.
[00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:23.203]  No, I did not see that.
[00:08:23.243 --> 00:08:25.743]  That's something that needs to go to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:26.163 --> 00:08:26.763]  Uh, continue.
[00:08:27.624 --> 00:08:31.425]  Okay, um, also wanted to mention something that that last caller said.
[00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:39.507]  You know, I think, uh, this innermost circle, I kind of doubt we're actually going to know who it is, or else they really wouldn't be in control.
[00:08:40.423 --> 00:08:40.923]  I agree.
[00:08:41.163 --> 00:08:42.704]  I absolutely agree.
[00:08:42.764 --> 00:08:43.344]  And you know what?
[00:08:43.584 --> 00:08:47.845]  There's no doubt that the Vatican is inherently evil.
[00:08:48.025 --> 00:08:49.646]  I mean, you look at who they got in the head right now.
[00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:51.966]  He's a former, you know, Nazi youth.
[00:08:52.006 --> 00:09:00.388]  But beyond that, when he was a cardinal in the church, he redistributed all these known pedophiles from church to church instead of punishing these guys.
[00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:06.010]  And, you know, anybody who is for Catholic priest pedophilia, I'm sorry, I just can't get behind that.
[00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:22.093]  You know, so you obviously know that that's a corrupt institution, and you look at, you know, the Vatican and how it really controls, you know, a lot of Italians, a lot of Europeans in general, and even people who, you know, are Catholic in this country, turn to the Pope, and, you know, they do all these crazy rituals.
[00:09:22.493 --> 00:09:25.694]  But, I mean, is that really the most innermost circle?
[00:09:25.714 --> 00:09:27.474]  I mean, I know they talk about the Black Pope.
[00:09:27.754 --> 00:09:33.535]  It's interesting reading, and there definitely are some dots to be connected there, but I don't know if they're the final dots, you know what I'm saying?
[00:09:34.767 --> 00:09:41.009]  Right, yeah, I just hear people talk about, oh, it's the Jews, or, oh, it's the Catholics, or, you know, it's this group, or it's that group.
[00:09:41.189 --> 00:09:43.310]  I kind of doubt we're going to know who it is.
[00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.190]  Yeah, and you know what?
[00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:51.092]  It's not based on, in my opinion, any race, ethnicity, or even outward religious belief.
[00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:58.595]  I think the common thing that binds most of these people is that they're powerful, they're elitist, and they're into the occult in some way, shape, or form.
[00:09:59.495 --> 00:10:04.256]  And other than that, I don't know how much farther we have to take it to identify these people.
[00:10:04.736 --> 00:10:06.857]  You know, a lot of people say, well, how are you ever going to take them on?
[00:10:06.877 --> 00:10:17.220]  Well, first of all, we have to take them on at the levels that we know about, and that's our own government, our own Constitution, our own Bill of Rights, you know, the judicial, executive, and legislative branches here at home.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:26.722]  And then overseas, you know, we have to expose the Tory and the Labour parties to being part of the same problem of this left-right paradigm that doesn't really exist.
[00:10:27.102 --> 00:10:34.850]  So I think exposing that is a lot more important than dealing with the minutiae of, you know, who started this and whatnot.
[00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:42.018]  Because if you really look at the roots, you know, I think that, you know, we had the writer and director of the America's Secret Beginning series on my program all week.
[00:10:42.904 --> 00:10:49.606]  That guy, you know, although, yeah, Chris Pinto, although I don't, you know, agree with everything he says, I think they lay out a compelling case.
[00:10:49.887 --> 00:10:52.848]  I think they do a pretty good job of naming names and showing people.
[00:10:53.188 --> 00:10:59.410]  And although, you know, the Vatican Church isn't that focused on, you know, it's put in there a couple times.
[00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:07.673]  I mean, people expect too much of other people, I think, and they want to go off into their own things and be the leaders and say, I have this information.
[00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:10.074]  It's kind of like the people that want to buy into, you know,
[00:11:11.414 --> 00:11:13.015]  Reptoids from the fourth dimension.
[00:11:13.135 --> 00:11:15.376]  You know, it's like, all right, where's the evidence?
[00:11:15.556 --> 00:11:21.259]  You know, I see all this, you know, I see all this Sumerian texts and I see all these, you know, wall paintings.
[00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:24.400]  Where's the video of the guy shape-shifting into a reptile?
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.060]  It's just not there.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.061]  Thank you for the call.
[00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:27.661]  We are going to move on.
[00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:30.163]  Let's go to Mark in Georgia.
[00:11:30.223 --> 00:11:30.943]  Mark, what's on your mind?
[00:11:32.677 --> 00:11:34.037]  God bless you.
[00:11:34.157 --> 00:11:34.978]  Mark, you know what?
[00:11:35.018 --> 00:11:36.258]  Let's hold you because we hear the music.
[00:11:36.318 --> 00:11:37.678]  I'll hold you over for the next segment.
[00:11:37.978 --> 00:11:39.419]  We're going to be taking Mark's calls.
[00:11:39.539 --> 00:11:42.459]  Robert, Rich, Anti-Illuminati, Michael, and more.
[00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:43.620]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.720]  I am Jason Burmess.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.921]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:03.695]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:12:03.835 --> 00:12:08.997]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:12:09.177 --> 00:12:10.517]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:12:10.797 --> 00:12:18.959]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:24.920]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.882]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:12:26.922 --> 00:12:29.125]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:12:29.245 --> 00:12:33.490]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:12:33.651 --> 00:12:35.773]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:12:35.873 --> 00:12:43.663]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:13:01.508 --> 00:13:07.789]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:09.890]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:13:10.785 --> 00:13:11.806]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:12.327 --> 00:13:12.827]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:13.147 --> 00:13:14.048]  This is his M.O.
[00:13:14.088 --> 00:13:15.450]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.172]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:17.492 --> 00:13:24.259]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:25.100]  Some U.S.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:30.786]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:31.466 --> 00:13:35.007]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:45.211]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:13:45.451 --> 00:13:46.192]  Fabled enemies.

[00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:07.653]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:08.213]  and the world.
[00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:11.936]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:15:12.337 --> 00:15:18.582]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:15:18.842 --> 00:15:20.624]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.

[00:15:39.595 --> 00:15:41.596]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[00:16:07.193 --> 00:16:07.913]  Alright folks, we are back.
[00:16:07.953 --> 00:16:09.214]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:09.274 --> 00:16:14.816]  And before we go back to your callers, uh, you know, we're talking a little bit about this occult and orders and stuff.
[00:16:39.229 --> 00:16:53.817]  I just want to point this out because, you know, a lot of these guys that are into the occult are also into one-worldism and global government and the quote-unquote new world order and, you know, somehow the UN works into that and you watch the America's Secret Beginning series, Eye of the Phoenix, the third one.
[00:16:55.098 --> 00:17:02.081]  You know, not only do they talk about the UN, but these other buildings there and these artifacts, well, this is out of Fox yesterday.
[00:17:03.042 --> 00:17:05.864]  Valuable works of art unaccounted for at the UN.
[00:17:07.034 --> 00:17:19.378]  Entrusted with safeguarding world peace and security, oh yes, world peace and security, that's what the UN's all about, the United Nations has failed to safeguard valuable works of art on its own premises according to an internal investigation.
[00:17:19.478 --> 00:17:25.961]  At least a dozen works of art loaned or donated to the world body have seemingly disappeared from its New York headquarters.
[00:17:26.972 --> 00:17:53.224]  and uh... you know these people are into it and uh... it's just it's crazy to me you know you wonder what that what's gone and why and are they using these in some kind of weird ritual or what not but i thought we'd throw that out there you know it is in the news let's go back to callers let's go to mark in georgia mark what's on your mind uh... i am blessed uh... in the lower disciplines those he loves and he's been loving the ever-loving not out of me
[00:17:54.048 --> 00:17:55.688]  I take it we're on the same page.
[00:17:55.848 --> 00:17:59.449]  I don't even like the word Christian, because it is so cheaply used.
[00:18:01.389 --> 00:18:10.371]  I trust you don't mind that we clarified that the word Religio is Latin for binds back together, and there's the ideal sense of being bound back to the Creator.
[00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:15.872]  In a human sense, it always has a certain measure of contamination with certain man-made ideas.
[00:18:17.872 --> 00:18:20.213]  So as far as that goes, I am trying.
[00:18:20.673 --> 00:18:22.013]  I'm in the delegate process.
[00:18:22.865 --> 00:18:30.588]  And I want to help the GOP realize it needs an emergency cranial-rectal extraction.
[00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:45.733]  And I do intend to use a bit of humor as to basically what I have seen as a trend is that the way I look at it is basically the devil's been in the business of deceiving people for a very, very, very long time.
[00:18:45.753 --> 00:18:47.353]  He knows his stuff.
[00:18:48.474 --> 00:18:51.075]  And I want to help people understand.
[00:18:52.642 --> 00:18:57.405]  I'm not talking in terms of Federal Reserve notes, the gold or silver, they fraudulently displaced.
[00:18:57.465 --> 00:19:02.508]  I'm talking about it's going to take the very high cost of real, genuine, moral courage.
[00:19:02.548 --> 00:19:05.450]  Not some political platitude of that, but the real thing.
[00:19:22.402 --> 00:19:24.004]  I think we're so far on the same page.
[00:19:24.364 --> 00:19:25.025]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:25.065 --> 00:19:25.845]  People need to step up.
[00:19:25.905 --> 00:19:32.191]  It's not just about living, you know, listening to a radio show or being an armchair quarterback or just emailing people.
[00:19:32.391 --> 00:19:33.252]  There's a million different things.
[00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:34.153]  You have to be a human being.
[00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:42.401]  You know, it's not just about emailing, making a website, going out there, showing a movie to somebody, taking them out to dinner, having a conversation, you know, loving your fellow man.
[00:19:43.181 --> 00:19:46.484]  Yeah, the prime commandment is love.
[00:19:47.285 --> 00:19:47.986]  And the thing is,
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:20:04.349]  What I want to get across to these people in the GOP, I think it's next weekend we're having our delegate meeting, and I want to get across to people, it was because people with great gentleness and patience earned my trust and respect that I came to my senses.
[00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:15.056]  And that's why you're going to think I'm crazy now, because I believe the official story of 9-11 is surely as true as the idea that the sun goes around the earth and that truth is ultimately a democracy.
[00:20:15.712 --> 00:20:17.353]  And obviously I'm being a smart aleck.
[00:20:17.433 --> 00:20:23.577]  I mentioned I want to do a series kind of like Jeff Foxworthy's You Might Be a Redneck If...
[00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:34.645]  You might be a neocon if you believe that by violating the God-given right to people all around the world in the name of freedom and democracy, this country is made safer.
[00:20:54.418 --> 00:20:59.163]  And, uh, you know, they're just gonna rape and pillage and they're gonna create their Eurasian Union that they're begging for.
[00:20:59.183 --> 00:21:02.706]  You know, I gotta let you go, Mark, because you're scratching and your phone's cutting in and out.
[00:21:02.746 --> 00:21:03.787]  I got a couple beeps in there.
[00:21:04.327 --> 00:21:05.708]  Uh, call me tomorrow or call me tonight.
[00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:09.352]  You know, again, the Info Warrior, 9 to midnight, Central Time.
[00:21:09.372 --> 00:21:10.913]  Uh, I gotta keep going through.
[00:21:10.933 --> 00:21:12.054]  We got a full list of callers.
[00:21:12.074 --> 00:21:13.716]  Let's go to Robert in Canada.
[00:21:13.776 --> 00:21:14.636]  Robert, what's on your mind?
[00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:18.240]  He just dropped.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.681]  Let's go to Rich in New York.
[00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:20.522]  Rich, what's on your mind?
[00:21:21.636 --> 00:21:22.817]  Oh wait, you know what?
[00:21:22.837 --> 00:21:23.818]  We're already hitting the break.
[00:21:23.878 --> 00:21:25.539]  Every time we go to a caller, we're hitting the break.
[00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:26.220]  We hit them last time.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.161]  Rich, I'm going to come back to you on the other side.
[00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:29.922]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:30.303 --> 00:21:34.486]  I am Jason Burmas, PrisonPlanet.TV and soon, the InfoWarrior blog.
[00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:35.026]  Can you wait?
[00:21:35.146 --> 00:21:35.847]  I know I can't.
[00:21:51.986 --> 00:21:52.867]  We're on the march.
[00:21:53.367 --> 00:21:54.948]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.968 --> 00:21:58.671]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:02.193 --> 00:22:02.633]  Attention.
[00:22:02.973 --> 00:22:05.635]  This is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.

[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:13.741]  Here is why.
[00:22:14.568 --> 00:22:24.555]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:22:25.016 --> 00:22:27.438]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:22:27.758 --> 00:22:29.839]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:22:29.879 --> 00:22:30.360]  this fall?
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.361]  Don't wait!

[00:23:03.523 --> 00:23:06.046]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:23:06.066 --> 00:23:08.630]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:09.871]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:09.891 --> 00:23:11.493]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:11.613 --> 00:23:14.417]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:23:14.437 --> 00:23:18.142]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[00:23:27.757 --> 00:23:32.682]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:33.924 --> 00:23:35.085]  An inside job?
[00:23:36.446 --> 00:23:40.270]  How dare you?
[00:23:40.531 --> 00:23:43.934]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:43.954 --> 00:23:46.157]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:46.297 --> 00:23:47.618]  And if the government has not told the truth,
[00:23:51.228 --> 00:23:53.069]  Truth Rising.

[00:24:01.423 --> 00:24:05.046]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:24:05.126 --> 00:24:10.731]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?

[00:24:23.783 --> 00:24:24.124]  I don't know.

[00:25:26.607 --> 00:25:29.269]  A little personal Jesus.
[00:25:29.289 --> 00:25:31.411]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:31.471 --> 00:25:32.872]  I am Jason Burmess sitting in.
[00:25:33.052 --> 00:25:36.014]  Remember, new show, 9 to midnight central time.
[00:25:36.054 --> 00:25:37.556]  The Info Warrior with Jason Burmess.
[00:25:37.616 --> 00:25:41.519]  It's a lot like this show now, because Alex Jones isn't here.
[00:25:42.179 --> 00:25:44.181]  So it's just me, ranting and raving.
[00:25:44.201 --> 00:25:45.222]  You can see all three hours.
[00:25:45.902 --> 00:25:52.149]  Over at PrisonPlanet.tv and we're encouraging you to repost that on the YouTube and the Google Video for the kids.
[00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.031]  We've got Rich in New York on the line.
[00:25:54.051 --> 00:25:58.476]  We're going to go to Anti-Illuminati, Michael, Michael, Bill, and Robert afterwards.
[00:25:59.397 --> 00:26:00.499]  Let's go to Rich.
[00:26:00.639 --> 00:26:01.500]  What's on your mind, Rich?
[00:26:02.492 --> 00:26:03.612]  Hey, Jason, great job.
[00:26:03.672 --> 00:26:06.973]  I just want to thank you and Alex for putting all that great information out there.
[00:26:06.993 --> 00:26:08.153]  I love your pumped music.
[00:26:08.273 --> 00:26:11.874]  I think you should play more Frank Zappa, because he also knew what was going on.
[00:26:12.234 --> 00:26:12.674]  Absolutely.
[00:26:12.694 --> 00:26:14.954]  He talked a lot about what you guys were talking about.
[00:26:15.054 --> 00:26:16.974]  You know, that's a good point.
[00:26:17.014 --> 00:26:24.316]  Before you ask the question, you know, Zappa, especially with, you know, I talked about Factor VIII and AIDS and the Bayer drugs and all that other stuff.
[00:26:24.356 --> 00:26:29.697]  He talked about, you know, AIDS being a bioengineered, you know, weapon from the United States government.
[00:26:29.717 --> 00:26:30.917]  We should pull that clip.
[00:26:30.937 --> 00:26:31.657]  Go ahead, Rich.
[00:26:32.369 --> 00:26:33.210]  Yeah, awesome.
[00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.331]  I knew it was going on.
[00:26:34.431 --> 00:26:45.400]  Anyway, Alex had mentioned something about these helicopters flying around that are kind of stealthy, and I've been seeing a number of them recently up here in the North Bronx.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.242]  We face a window that faces absolutely no buildings.
[00:26:48.302 --> 00:26:50.724]  Look over a big golf course there in Cortland.
[00:26:50.744 --> 00:26:51.825]  I don't know if you know the area.
[00:26:51.905 --> 00:26:59.431]  Anyway, these things are so close and so low to the ground with the rotors going, and you
[00:26:59.835 --> 00:27:01.157]  Almost can't hear the rotors.
[00:27:01.257 --> 00:27:03.960]  It's almost like an imperceptible boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:06.623]  You know, really almost movie-like.
[00:27:06.964 --> 00:27:08.345]  That's the only way to put it.
[00:27:08.846 --> 00:27:12.070]  And I'm wondering if he knows anything about pain generation?
[00:27:16.612 --> 00:27:33.578]  Have you seen the ones where they hook the satellite up, CNN's done some stories on them, they put it up on a tank or a van and it's a sound weapon and they have all these troops stand about 100 feet out in the field and they hit you with different levels on it.
[00:27:34.099 --> 00:27:35.059]  It's about the same thing.
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.301]  Yeah, yeah, what they're probably doing here is urban warfare.
[00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:46.903]  I mean, you're in the Bronx, so, you know, they're probably doing a little urban warfare training, which they, you know, he shows in Police State 1, 2, and 3.
[00:27:47.143 --> 00:27:49.524]  I mean, these are the black unmarked helicopters, right?
[00:27:50.264 --> 00:27:57.226]  Yeah, with the, actually, I don't know if it's a gun mount up front or an antenna, but there is a stick sticking off the nose, and it looks pretty threatening.
[00:27:58.528 --> 00:28:04.113]  Yeah, you know, I wasn't going to tell this story, but I told the guys last night, and I might as well just let it out.
[00:28:04.153 --> 00:28:05.074]  Thank you for the call, Rich.
[00:28:05.994 --> 00:28:09.677]  I moved out to Austin a couple weeks ago, just before I got out here.
[00:28:09.697 --> 00:28:12.840]  I basically was scoping places out from New York on Craigslist.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.841]  I found this one place.
[00:28:14.081 --> 00:28:15.442]  I actually got the place I wanted.
[00:28:15.642 --> 00:28:17.023]  It's about 20 minutes from Austin.
[00:28:17.264 --> 00:28:18.545]  It's in a very remote area.
[00:28:19.946 --> 00:28:22.968]  For instance, on the GPS, it doesn't even take me to my house.
[00:28:23.008 --> 00:28:26.191]  It takes me to a corner road, and my house is about a mile up the road.
[00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:42.142]  So I'm pulling in there yesterday and I'm telling you there was a black helicopter right in my neighborhood and I'm used to seeing like the unmarked helicopters in upstate New York because they're constantly looking for marijuana fields and I live out in these wooded areas so I see them all the time.
[00:28:42.302 --> 00:28:43.182]  You read about busts.
[00:28:44.103 --> 00:28:46.363]  There's just no tree line where I am.
[00:28:47.283 --> 00:28:47.983]  It's all flat.
[00:28:49.084 --> 00:28:50.744]  The grass is pretty burnt up from the sun.
[00:28:50.904 --> 00:28:54.345]  You're lucky to get a little green grass and I'm looking at this thing and I'm like, why is it here?
[00:28:54.645 --> 00:28:55.425]  What is it doing here?
[00:28:56.437 --> 00:28:57.538]  I don't want to be paranoid.
[00:28:57.558 --> 00:29:02.121]  I just wanted to put it out there because, you know, I said it to my two producers last night.
[00:29:02.161 --> 00:29:04.163]  I'm like, you know, before I forget, this did happen to me.
[00:29:04.223 --> 00:29:11.748]  So, you know, if they find me, you know, I didn't hang myself and they find the dogs licking me while I hang myself with a big long note.
[00:29:11.828 --> 00:29:12.649]  It wasn't me, folks.
[00:29:12.829 --> 00:29:13.349]  I didn't do it.
[00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.791]  Okay, so what are these black helicopters doing?
[00:29:16.811 --> 00:29:17.492]  Well, we know what they're doing.
[00:29:17.512 --> 00:29:19.093]  They're doing urban warfare training.
[00:29:19.213 --> 00:29:20.373]  Often, it's not just U.S.
[00:29:20.413 --> 00:29:20.673]  troops.
[00:29:20.693 --> 00:29:21.854]  They'll bring in foreign troops.
[00:29:22.294 --> 00:29:28.657]  Again, all in the police state films, covered slightly in Alex Jones' Road to Tyranny, one of my favorite films by him.
[00:29:29.158 --> 00:29:29.418]  You know what?
[00:29:29.438 --> 00:29:33.700]  Let's go to Robert in Canada, because he was holding before, and we let him go.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.581]  He's the bottomless now, but let's bring him to the top.
[00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:36.761]  Robert, what's on your mind?
[00:29:38.062 --> 00:29:39.183]  Hey, Jason.
[00:29:40.083 --> 00:29:43.765]  I've changed gears a little bit off the Illuminati and Christian bit.
[00:29:44.738 --> 00:29:55.102]  I wanted to ask you, this would have been directed to Bob as well when he was on earlier, but you're in the fight, so I figured you're spin as good as any.
[00:29:56.022 --> 00:30:07.246]  As I look at the economy all around, you'd look at lots of turmoil in Europe, lots of turmoil in the States, but by and large there seems to be no financial turmoil in Canada, and that's where I live.
[00:30:09.043 --> 00:30:18.039]  You read about these stories about how the classes happen overnight and all of a sudden the bank has announced, by the way your money is worth half as much as it was.
[00:30:19.386 --> 00:30:24.549]  I'm just wondering if that's going to be something, if you think it's going to be something that will be initially isolated to the United States or just... I don't think so.
[00:30:24.569 --> 00:30:26.491]  I think it's going to happen to everybody.
[00:30:26.511 --> 00:30:31.434]  Yeah, well, I think it's eventually going to have to come to Canada since our economies are so heavily intertwined.
[00:30:31.914 --> 00:30:33.995]  And what is the parity rating right now?
[00:30:34.035 --> 00:30:38.718]  I think that Canadians' dollar is just, you know, a few cents higher than the American dollar.
[00:30:38.978 --> 00:30:39.659]  They're pretty close, right?
[00:30:39.699 --> 00:30:40.739]  It's quite a bit less, actually.
[00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:41.860]  It's quite a bit less, actually.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.301]  It's less than a dollar again.
[00:30:43.962 --> 00:30:44.182]  Really?
[00:30:44.202 --> 00:30:45.082]  Well, that's not good news.
[00:30:46.463 --> 00:30:49.244]  Well, that's good news for us because, you see, we sell our shit to the world.
[00:30:49.384 --> 00:30:51.005]  Oh, I've got to let you go, man.
[00:30:51.385 --> 00:30:52.606]  You've got to watch the language.
[00:30:52.866 --> 00:30:53.346]  I thank you.
[00:30:53.566 --> 00:30:53.827]  You know what?
[00:30:53.867 --> 00:30:54.827]  That's a good question, though.
[00:30:54.887 --> 00:30:59.769]  Before that point, you wonder, is Canada going to get hit as much?
[00:30:59.929 --> 00:31:00.390]  You don't see it.
[00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:02.311]  You do see the European economy going down.
[00:31:03.391 --> 00:31:07.773]  You see Gordon Brown coming over here and fawning to the United States, but North American Union
[00:31:09.554 --> 00:31:11.235]  Canada is an integral part of that.
[00:31:11.996 --> 00:31:14.777]  And your Prime Minister is big time New World Order.
[00:31:15.058 --> 00:31:22.342]  You know, it's just like I've had a couple callers asking me to do shows on the Canadian Prime Minister and the Australian Prime Minister and their NWO ties.
[00:31:22.702 --> 00:31:23.703]  I'm bringing it to you next week.
[00:31:24.103 --> 00:31:24.744]  I'm announcing it.
[00:31:24.784 --> 00:31:25.764]  I'm going to look into it.
[00:31:25.784 --> 00:31:28.026]  I'm going to try to get as many... Who is it?
[00:31:28.086 --> 00:31:29.086]  Hartman, I think?
[00:31:30.087 --> 00:31:32.529]  I can't remember who the Canadian Prime Minister is.
[00:31:32.569 --> 00:31:33.970]  Bring that up on there for me, guys.
[00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:34.890]  Is it Rudd?
[00:31:36.591 --> 00:31:37.071]  I'm not sure.
[00:31:37.171 --> 00:31:38.632]  Well, Karen's going to bring it up.
[00:31:39.432 --> 00:31:40.212]  Rudd is Australia.
[00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:41.332]  That's right, Rudd is Australia.
[00:31:41.352 --> 00:31:43.933]  I can't think of who the Prime Minister of Canada is.
[00:31:43.953 --> 00:31:46.134]  But listen, these guys are in on the globalist plan.
[00:31:46.414 --> 00:31:47.574]  There's nowhere to run.
[00:31:47.754 --> 00:31:49.855]  You can't just jump, you know, states.
[00:31:50.475 --> 00:31:52.435]  I can't move to Canada and everything's going to be okay.
[00:31:52.795 --> 00:31:53.436]  They work together.
[00:31:54.436 --> 00:31:57.137]  All right, let's go to Anti-Illuminati in Nevada.
[00:31:57.277 --> 00:31:58.697]  Anti-Illuminati, how you doing?
[00:31:59.857 --> 00:32:00.498]  Harper, that's it.
[00:32:00.518 --> 00:32:02.178]  Hi, Jason.
[00:32:02.198 --> 00:32:02.998]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:32:03.298 --> 00:32:03.698]  You got it.
[00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:05.679]  Yeah, first I just wanted to
[00:32:06.459 --> 00:32:08.380]  I commend you on the film that you made, Fabled Enemies.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.901]  That was a really well-made documentary.
[00:32:11.481 --> 00:32:11.822]  Thank you.
[00:32:12.442 --> 00:32:25.228]  I just want to remind everybody how important the testimony that Indira Singh gave when she had that Citizens 9-11 committee with Mike Rupert.
[00:32:26.028 --> 00:32:31.871]  You have to keep in mind that the enterprise architects that she worked with, she was supposed to be dead.
[00:32:34.234 --> 00:32:38.455]  People don't really know the story sometimes, so why don't you just tell them who Indira Singh was.
[00:32:38.475 --> 00:32:40.716]  She worked with some pretty prominent software, didn't she?
[00:32:41.796 --> 00:32:45.197]  Yeah, she was with JP Morgan and she was a risk architect.
[00:32:46.598 --> 00:33:01.002]  And basically, well, I mean, the whole thing, you can see this on YouTube and so forth, but I honestly didn't really want to spend time explaining something that... Basically she was into Promise and Carnivore and saw that something was coming and tried to blow the whistle.
[00:33:01.422 --> 00:33:02.242]  And no dice.
[00:33:03.663 --> 00:33:16.206]  Yeah, she reported that to the Chief Intelligence Officers and they ignored it.
[00:33:17.006 --> 00:33:33.509]  Well, I've done a lot of research on this and the reason, you know, when you connect the dots to all this stuff, these guys were involved in covering this up because, let me try to get on track here, I'm sorry, I'm kind of like flustered here.
[00:33:37.808 --> 00:33:47.377]  There's a very serious attack going on, a plan going on with a coordinated attack with the internet and the avian flu thing.
[00:33:48.938 --> 00:33:55.984]  And this is Booz Allen Hamilton, who I mentioned last time when I called in when Alex was there.
[00:33:56.725 --> 00:33:58.827]  They're involved, they're the ones who are running these war games.
[00:34:00.109 --> 00:34:00.630]  Who is that?
[00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.092]  Is this a conglomerate?
[00:34:03.152 --> 00:34:04.213]  Is this a corporation?
[00:34:04.253 --> 00:34:06.975]  You said, what was the name again?
[00:34:07.035 --> 00:34:09.517]  It's a corporation.
[00:34:09.818 --> 00:34:16.283]  It's almost like a, you might as well for all practical purposes, consider it a military industrial complex business.
[00:34:16.584 --> 00:34:18.285]  Kind of like a Lockheed Martin or Raytheon?
[00:34:18.886 --> 00:34:21.188]  Yeah, but yeah, they specialize in war gaming.
[00:34:21.388 --> 00:34:22.549]  Okay.
[00:34:22.569 --> 00:34:24.731]  Here's the thing that freaked me out today.
[00:34:30.083 --> 00:34:46.435]  What they're doing is, they're talking about how bird flu can, you know, because of the quarantining that it would cause and how people, you know, how it would just kill people, but also how they would have to quarantine areas.
[00:34:46.835 --> 00:34:47.376]  Sure.
[00:34:47.536 --> 00:34:54.121]  They're talking about that in the context of something called a COOP, which is a continuity of operations, okay?
[00:34:55.051 --> 00:35:02.197]  And they're going to, when you analyze it, when you look at this information, I'm going to post this stuff as soon as I get off the phone.
[00:35:02.617 --> 00:35:04.939]  And please send it to Aaron at Infowars.com as well.
[00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:06.720]  Okay.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:14.526]  What it looks like is, is they're going to say, well, these government employees, they still need to access Department of Defense systems to do their work.
[00:35:15.327 --> 00:35:15.647]  Okay.
[00:35:16.087 --> 00:35:20.191]  So how are they going to do that if they can't physically be there because everything's contaminated?
[00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:23.193]  They have to use secure internet communication.
[00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:24.780]  Guess what that means?
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:35.248]  That means that all the infrastructure for Internet 2, they're going to flip the switches on and that's how the Department of Defense employees are going to be able to work at the Pentagon remotely and so forth.
[00:35:35.268 --> 00:35:37.470]  So you think they already have the infrastructure built in?
[00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:42.954]  You think they already have the infrastructure built in for Internet 2 and it's just going to be the right crisis to bring it in?
[00:35:43.775 --> 00:35:46.137]  I don't know if they have it entirely set up.
[00:35:48.709 --> 00:35:54.474]  It only makes sense for them to have it set up to the extent to which their critical systems can be implemented.
[00:35:54.494 --> 00:35:59.938]  Listen, I want you to post this information, and then, Aaron's not here right now, so why don't you send it to my MySpace as well?
[00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:00.398]  Can you do that?
[00:36:00.418 --> 00:36:02.220]  Here's another thing that ties into this.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.761]  It's really weird, right?
[00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:04.862]  Alright, really quick.
[00:36:04.882 --> 00:36:15.490]  There was a commercial by Juniper Networks that talked about how their routers are compliant with all these Homeland Security directives, as well as teleworking.
[00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.791]  I'm like, what?
[00:36:17.443 --> 00:36:18.824]  I said, what is that all about?
[00:36:19.004 --> 00:36:31.896]  It's like, computer, communications, infrastructure, hardware, is being forced into compliance with all the stuff that's going to be tied into securing cyberspace for the 44th presidency.
[00:36:32.455 --> 00:36:36.999]  Because it's, I mean, it's like these guys are actually serious about carrying this out.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:37.980]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:36:38.101 --> 00:36:40.263]  I gotta let you go because I got other callers, man.
[00:36:40.603 --> 00:36:51.394]  But, you know, we did a report on the InfoWarrior, how they were trying to blame Iranian hackers for getting the specs to Marine One, which is the helicopter instead of Air Force One.
[00:36:51.974 --> 00:37:03.483]  And, uh, you know, oh no, because the infrastructure of the internet is so bad, these Iranian hackers were able to get the specs for Marine One through a subcontractor, and we need to shut it down, and we need to re-regulate.
[00:37:03.744 --> 00:37:13.571]  It's all fear-mongering to bring in this new system of control, this new internet, that will have us all sign in, probably biometrically, with a thumb scan, an iris scan, God knows what they'll be doing.
[00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:14.412]  Maybe they'll want blood.
[00:37:14.933 --> 00:37:16.374]  Maybe it'll be a nice little DNA prick.
[00:37:16.414 --> 00:37:17.314]  Isn't that gonna be delicious?
[00:37:17.375 --> 00:37:17.655]  Yay!
[00:37:18.752 --> 00:37:20.213]  Yay!
[00:37:21.414 --> 00:37:22.255]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:22.295 --> 00:37:25.657]  It'll be happy times, unicorns and rainbows, you know?
[00:37:26.218 --> 00:37:36.625]  And on top of that, your websites will be redirected through large corporate websites or state university websites, so they will ultimately have control over whatever content you want to put up there.
[00:37:36.885 --> 00:37:44.771]  You know, Consumption Junction will be alright for all you, you know, disgusting people out there like myself that just want to see, you know, horse attacks or whatever.
[00:37:45.252 --> 00:37:46.413]  You know, that'll still be around.
[00:37:47.233 --> 00:37:51.234]  But unfortunately, Infowars.com and Prison Planet probably aren't going to make it.
[00:37:51.374 --> 00:38:03.136]  They'll probably have knock-off sites that appear to be hardcore, but they'll probably have imprisoned Alex so long ago that it's all going to be watered-down information, much like a Huffington Post or a Raw story.
[00:38:03.356 --> 00:38:03.976]  Oh, I said it!
[00:38:04.656 --> 00:38:05.056]  I said it!
[00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:07.677]  They don't go far enough, or even an op-ed.
[00:38:08.057 --> 00:38:11.157]  I mean, every once in a while they do okay, but come on, give me a break.
[00:38:11.757 --> 00:38:12.797]  Alright, let's go to our next caller.
[00:38:12.817 --> 00:38:14.878]  Let's go to Michael in Massachusetts.
[00:38:14.978 --> 00:38:15.818]  Michael, what's on your mind?
[00:38:16.397 --> 00:38:17.418]  Hey Jason, what's up, buddy?
[00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:19.058]  Congratulations on all your success.
[00:38:19.099 --> 00:38:19.739]  Love the new show.
[00:38:20.159 --> 00:38:20.519]  Thank you.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:37.789]  I wanted to mention Words, Terms, Admiralty and Jordan Maxwell, but before I do, I have to mention that Frank Zappa, what that guy said earlier, you know, you might want to do like 30 minutes, you know, see if you can get Dweezil on or Gale maybe, and talk about how
[00:38:39.088 --> 00:38:53.421]  Not only was Frank Zappa's music crazy and different, but it represented a much higher degree of sophistication at a time when, you know, culture in general, but music especially, was being, you know, dumbed down by, you know, corporate, you know, and all that.
[00:38:54.102 --> 00:38:55.963]  No, no, I've listened to the albums, they're incredible.
[00:38:56.284 --> 00:39:05.192]  There's that one album that sounds so much like the Wizard of Oz, it's like almost enchanting, but you know, he was a very talented guy, and like I said, you look at some of his interviews, he was very in the know.
[00:39:06.368 --> 00:39:23.677]  Yeah, I mean, there's that interview that just, you know, surfaced recently where, you know, the guy from the Czech Republic, I think it was, was interviewing him, and, you know, he said, well, you know, George Bush gave that speech about the New World Order, and then the guy go, wait a minute, didn't Hitler write a book called the New World Order?
[00:39:23.717 --> 00:39:25.758]  And Frank said, exactly.
[00:39:26.179 --> 00:39:35.744]  So he knew about this stuff, you know, he didn't, he just, you know, obviously, in the 80s, you couldn't really blast off about it if you wanted to sell any records, but anyways, can I talk about Admiralty?
[00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:39.822]  I don't know if any of you guys have seen this.
[00:39:39.862 --> 00:39:47.963]  I know someone called in and brought it up the other day, but there's this guy out there in Great Britain named John Harris, and he's like your average working guy.
[00:39:48.023 --> 00:39:59.566]  I guess he's a cop or nerd, and he does this whole presentation on words, terms, admiralty, policemen versus police officer, corporations, you know, the use of words and terms and how they know what they mean.
[00:40:00.126 --> 00:40:00.726]  Common law.
[00:40:00.746 --> 00:40:02.147]  Yeah, common law, absolutely.
[00:40:04.127 --> 00:40:05.207]  You know, you get your new show.
[00:40:05.847 --> 00:40:11.489]  I know it's difficult to get this guy, he's old, but I mean, if you ever wanted to give him... What's his name?
[00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:15.550]  Listen, email me his name because, you know, I had a big common law discussion.
[00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.630]  I mean, I've had numerous ones.
[00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:25.612]  I've gone to a couple conferences where it's the head topic, but I also sat down with an author who's no longer with us named Tupper Saucy.
[00:40:26.192 --> 00:40:41.628]  And he is actually one of those guys that goes deep into the Jesuit order in his books and on top of that talks about common law and admiralty law and the court system and how you have to play the game and what words you have to use and you know if you want to make declarations there's another
[00:40:42.408 --> 00:40:44.810]  Really good documentary out there, Hijacking Humanity.
[00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:50.694]  It's on YouTube and Google Video, which has a whole section dedicated to admiralty and common law.
[00:40:51.114 --> 00:40:53.155]  A lot of people in this movement don't know about it.
[00:40:53.255 --> 00:40:59.519]  I don't know how valid it will hold up in today's system.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.100]  You know what I mean?
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.561]  It feels like it's a do-anything-you-want kind of system.
[00:41:02.581 --> 00:41:05.503]  It doesn't hurt to have this knowledge, and it may help you in the future.
[00:41:05.523 --> 00:41:06.724]  I thank you for the call, Michael.
[00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:09.986]  We're going to move on to yet another Michael in California.
[00:41:10.026 --> 00:41:10.907]  Michael, what's on your mind?
[00:41:13.163 --> 00:41:13.723]  Still with us, Mike?
[00:41:14.284 --> 00:41:14.844]  I'm still there.
[00:41:14.864 --> 00:41:15.885]  How are you doing?
[00:41:16.265 --> 00:41:16.626]  Good, man.
[00:41:17.406 --> 00:41:19.288]  Okay, I just want to touch on a couple things.
[00:41:19.608 --> 00:41:22.890]  You were talking about that a lot of people think the age of Aquarius is here.
[00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:24.191]  Or on the way.
[00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:38.662]  I mean, I don't want to say a lot of people, but the elite think that they're going to be bringing in this new age, and it seems like this new age is the age of Aquarius, their next big symbol, and it will come through some astrological or metaphysical event.
[00:41:39.482 --> 00:41:45.045]  Well, I've been an astrologer for over 30 years, and there is some truth to what they're saying.
[00:41:45.386 --> 00:41:53.150]  But the point is that it doesn't matter what you believe or what I believe, if enough people believe something, it can create a Hegelian dialectic movement.
[00:41:54.351 --> 00:41:56.733]  A problem-reaction-solution kind of movement.
[00:41:57.213 --> 00:42:00.655]  Kind of, but you know, we've got all these Obama guys who are fanatics.
[00:42:01.215 --> 00:42:04.217]  But what I'm going to point out is to watch for May 22nd.
[00:42:04.297 --> 00:42:06.018]  Okay, on May 22nd,
[00:42:07.236 --> 00:42:11.159]  Jupiter, Chiron, and Neptune will all be at 26 degrees Aquarius.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.962]  Uranus will be at 26 degrees Pisces.
[00:42:14.422 --> 00:42:17.545]  Neptune rules Pisces, Uranus rules Aquarius.
[00:42:17.945 --> 00:42:21.868]  It's the proverbial hand-off, like a relay race when they hand a baton off.
[00:42:22.449 --> 00:42:22.689]  Right?
[00:42:22.949 --> 00:42:25.391]  Neptune is... We were in the Piscean era.
[00:42:25.711 --> 00:42:27.793]  Christ was the sage of the Piscean era.
[00:42:28.514 --> 00:42:30.355]  Buddha was the sage of the Aryan age.
[00:42:31.136 --> 00:42:33.217]  Krishna was the sage of the Taurean age.
[00:42:33.257 --> 00:42:35.059]  That's why India has all those houses.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:36.060]  Okay.
[00:42:36.401 --> 00:42:38.923]  Well, they think Obama's the sage of the Aquarian Age.
[00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:40.604]  So you think this is the guy?
[00:42:40.664 --> 00:42:41.845]  This is their new Maitreya?
[00:42:41.885 --> 00:42:44.347]  Their new... Their new Antichrist?
[00:42:44.968 --> 00:42:45.848]  Their new leader?
[00:42:45.868 --> 00:42:47.369]  You really think it's the Obama, huh?
[00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:48.370]  I'm gonna let you go.
[00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:50.592]  It's food for thought from an astrologer.
[00:42:50.932 --> 00:42:53.014]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:42:53.054 --> 00:42:54.035]  More calls after this.
[00:43:03.202 --> 00:43:05.144]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:43:05.748 --> 00:43:08.256]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:43:08.838 --> 00:43:13.011]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.501]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:43:15.862 --> 00:43:18.884]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:43:19.264 --> 00:43:22.247]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.

[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:40.420]  I think so.
[00:44:01.314 --> 00:44:07.696]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:08.076 --> 00:44:10.056]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:10.716 --> 00:44:11.736]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:12.277 --> 00:44:12.797]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:13.077 --> 00:44:14.017]  This is his M.O.s.
[00:44:14.037 --> 00:44:15.377]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:15.437 --> 00:44:17.098]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:17.438 --> 00:44:24.179]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:25.020]  Some U.S.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:30.701]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:31.401 --> 00:44:34.922]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:35.282 --> 00:44:45.144]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[00:46:17.297 --> 00:46:19.100]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in for Alex.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:28.573]  We're going to continue to take your calls in this next segment, and then at the 8 aftermark in the next hour, we're going to have Susan Lynn, a state representative on about H.J.R.
[00:46:29.394 --> 00:46:31.597]  108 and state sovereignty in Tennessee.
[00:46:32.534 --> 00:46:35.495]  I'm going to read the bill for you in the next segment.
[00:46:35.535 --> 00:46:38.916]  But before we go to our callers, I just want to thank one more of our sponsors today.
[00:46:38.936 --> 00:46:41.557]  Because without the sponsors, folks, just not possible.
[00:46:41.897 --> 00:46:44.358]  Just can't have the little radio shows that we're putting on here.
[00:46:44.759 --> 00:46:48.360]  Nothing's for free and, you know, I've got to eat, you've got to eat.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.602]  And why not eat with SurvivalistSeeds.com?
[00:46:51.942 --> 00:47:02.468]  Actually, in New York, I have this little garden and we do grow food, you know, big sunflowers for my little niece, but we also grow cucumbers, tomatoes, green beans, all this stuff.
[00:47:03.088 --> 00:47:04.309]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:08.272]  Now you can grow your own healthy food for just four pennies a pound and break free from the NWO.
[00:47:08.312 --> 00:47:15.116]  Our sponsor, Survivalist Seeds, has now drastically reduced their price for heirloom seeds at www.SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:47:16.095 --> 00:47:22.318]  They now sell 6,000 rare heirloom seeds from 20 varieties for just $108.95.

[00:47:34.264 --> 00:47:35.245]  Freedom starts with action.
[00:47:35.445 --> 00:47:41.428]  www.survivalofseeds.com is how you survive in the world economic collapse.
[00:47:42.208 --> 00:47:44.170]  And you know, hopefully there isn't a huge collapse.
[00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:44.871]  But you know what?
[00:47:45.472 --> 00:47:49.516]  My grandfather and I used to, that was one of the things we used to do together is he had a little garden.
[00:47:49.836 --> 00:47:51.358]  Always fond of that stuff.
[00:47:51.438 --> 00:47:52.760]  I never wanted to be a farmer.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.601]  I grew up around them.
[00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:55.743]  But it's nice to have your own little garden in the back.
[00:47:55.783 --> 00:48:00.148]  And like I said, me and my niece get down and she really enjoys it and she is just cute as a button.
[00:48:00.188 --> 00:48:01.629]  So survivalofseeds.com.

[00:48:10.497 --> 00:48:12.559]  Let's go to Bill in Connecticut.
[00:48:12.599 --> 00:48:13.340]  Bill, what's on your mind?
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:14.721]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:48:15.161 --> 00:48:15.501]  Good, man.
[00:48:16.342 --> 00:48:18.364]  Hey, I just stopped.
[00:48:18.384 --> 00:48:19.525]  This is my first time calling in.
[00:48:19.545 --> 00:48:29.894]  In any case, I have just so many questions, but the one thing I wanted to speak to was I found it interesting that the stuff that's in the Telegraph, you know, Blackjack,
[00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:32.190]  I'm not sure.
[00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:43.352]  Well, Alex Jones, Alex had a caller that called in from, he was talking about the London Telegraph, and he was talking about having a tactical nuke attack on the United States.
[00:48:43.372 --> 00:48:46.173]  It's a picture story that they've been running over there, Operation Blackjack.
[00:48:46.433 --> 00:48:47.513]  Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[00:48:47.693 --> 00:48:48.073]  Continue.
[00:48:48.513 --> 00:48:48.673]  Okay.
[00:48:48.693 --> 00:48:52.014]  Well, in any case, I'm up here in Connecticut.
[00:48:52.074 --> 00:48:53.114]  Are you here in New York or no?
[00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:58.295]  No, I left, I'm out in Texas, but I was up there until the last week of February.
[00:48:58.875 --> 00:48:59.115]  Alright.
[00:48:59.699 --> 00:49:03.020]  In any case, long and short of all this, I'm a stockbroker, so I study things.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:13.223]  And one of the things that I found very interesting pertaining to that picture story that they had on there, and they ran that for five weeks, okay?
[00:49:13.743 --> 00:49:18.665]  No author, pretty heinous when you sit there and look at it.
[00:49:18.925 --> 00:49:28.688]  It basically ushers in the New World, not the New World Order, but the North American Union, you know, putting everybody down under martial law, the police, the whole nine.
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:38.244]  Uh, but what I found interesting about it was that at the end of the script, it turns around and it talks about how everybody's going to get their new ID cards.
[00:49:39.445 --> 00:49:39.745]  Okay?
[00:49:40.265 --> 00:49:47.369]  And everybody's going to get inoculated with these anti-bio, you know, vaccines.
[00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:48.870]  Okay?
[00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:56.094]  Now, the only reason why I bring this up is back in August, I found a stock called Emergent BioSolutions.
[00:49:57.334 --> 00:49:57.635]  Okay?
[00:49:57.895 --> 00:49:58.515]  Out of Maryland.
[00:49:59.434 --> 00:49:59.774]  Okay.
[00:49:59.794 --> 00:49:59.874]  Okay.
[00:50:14.603 --> 00:50:19.565]  It was just... It just leveled off or it went too high?
[00:50:19.885 --> 00:50:20.365]  What happened?
[00:50:20.825 --> 00:50:23.086]  Well, I'm going to hold you over on the other side.
[00:50:23.106 --> 00:50:30.129]  Basically, are you telling me you think that the stock is rising in this thing because the guys that are going to give us these inoculations?
[00:50:30.489 --> 00:50:30.969]  Is this coming?
[00:50:30.989 --> 00:50:33.050]  I mean, now that I saw Blackjack, I remember it.
[00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:34.890]  This thing was a made-up story in the Telegraph.
[00:50:35.071 --> 00:50:35.811]  We'll be back after this.
[00:50:35.831 --> 00:50:38.412]  This is the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:43.519 --> 00:50:45.100]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.402]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:51.303 --> 00:50:51.883]  Hello, friends.
[00:50:51.923 --> 00:50:52.864]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:50:52.984 --> 00:50:57.566]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:57.726 --> 00:51:00.488]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:00.688 --> 00:51:03.549]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:03.729 --> 00:51:08.452]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:08.692 --> 00:51:09.613]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:09.813 --> 00:51:12.734]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:13.055 --> 00:51:19.939]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:20.079 --> 00:51:23.160]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:23.321 --> 00:51:23.581]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:28.445]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:28.465 --> 00:51:34.551]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:51:34.731 --> 00:51:38.475]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:39.836]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:39.856 --> 00:51:40.437]  Take action today.
[00:51:40.477 --> 00:51:42.299]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:54.139 --> 00:51:56.041]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:56.522 --> 00:51:59.305]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.461]  Alright folks, we are back.
[00:52:17.481 --> 00:52:20.484]  It is the final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:52:20.504 --> 00:52:21.725]  I am Jason Burness, sitting in.
[00:52:21.745 --> 00:52:24.147]  We got an interesting caller on the line, Bill from Connecticut.
[00:52:24.207 --> 00:52:27.670]  Now that I saw the blackjack thing, a lot of people might not be familiar.
[00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:28.971]  I didn't think of it off the top of my head.
[00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:36.358]  This was a, like a little short movie or a bunch of pictures that was supposed to be, you know, fictional.
[00:52:36.398 --> 00:52:39.921]  It was this story posted in the Telegraph, basically about this
[00:52:41.122 --> 00:52:51.368]  Nuclear and biochemical attack and how we were all going to be rounded up and it was just very dark and it brought in concentration camps and martial law and like you said at the end, everybody was inoculated.
[00:52:51.648 --> 00:52:57.672]  Now you were mentioning this company, this BioChemistries, and what was the significance there?
[00:52:58.712 --> 00:53:08.838]  Well, the significance is that basically these guys, if you look at what they do, they make vaccinations for
[00:53:09.505 --> 00:53:14.207]  The most heinous biochemical warfare stuff you could ever possibly think of.
[00:53:14.987 --> 00:53:25.071]  Now, the thing that's amazing about this also is that when you look at the stocks that are all in that space, specifically that space, they're all going up.
[00:53:25.131 --> 00:53:34.015]  As a matter of fact, I had one of my clients call me from Florida, and he had me turn around and sit and buy a company for his father.
[00:53:34.335 --> 00:53:35.335]  Now, it's a penny stock.
[00:53:35.976 --> 00:53:37.036]  I don't typically buy those.
[00:53:37.574 --> 00:53:41.356]  There's a B-O-N-U dot O-B, okay?
[00:53:41.637 --> 00:53:55.325]  And I'm not promoting this stock, but the thing that amazes me about this is he was telling me that he's working with a military contractor, that's how I found out about this, and what they do is they have a vaccine for anthrax.
[00:53:56.966 --> 00:53:59.728]  Okay, well, go back to Emergent BioSolutions.
[00:54:00.168 --> 00:54:00.848]  What do they do?
[00:54:01.789 --> 00:54:02.289]  Anthrax.
[00:54:04.306 --> 00:54:06.587]  And other things, you know, nasty polio stuff.
[00:54:06.767 --> 00:54:09.408]  So, you know, I mean, we're talking nasty stuff.
[00:54:09.488 --> 00:54:12.869]  Well, you look at polio, they got caught putting simian virus 40 in that.
[00:54:12.909 --> 00:54:14.050]  We covered that earlier today.
[00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:15.490]  Okay?
[00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:18.111]  You look at these anti-flu vaccines, Tamiflu.
[00:54:18.572 --> 00:54:22.453]  It's now, there's a new flu stream that's 98.5% resistant to it.
[00:54:22.773 --> 00:54:30.216]  You look at this Baxter debacle, and in the bird flu vaccinations, they get caught putting H5N1, H5N2, two separate strains of bird flu in it.
[00:54:32.777 --> 00:54:34.738]  And then a separate type of flu virus.
[00:54:34.998 --> 00:54:38.318]  You know, I hope that they're not coming down with a chemical attack.
[00:54:38.338 --> 00:54:44.580]  You know, you just mentioned anthrax, and one of the stories we hadn't really covered is that they tested some of those anthrax samples.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:52.582]  Remember, they tried to pin now the anthrax attacks after seven years on Bruce Ivins, who magically commits suicide in government custody.
[00:54:52.602 --> 00:54:55.043]  That was a small little blurb in a lot of the articles.
[00:54:55.503 --> 00:54:57.784]  And they tested the anthrax, and of course they don't match.
[00:54:57.824 --> 00:54:59.484]  So, is something on the horizon?
[00:54:59.804 --> 00:55:04.627]  I would really appreciate it if you sent that information to Aaron at Infowars.com because that was just a great caller.
[00:55:05.348 --> 00:55:09.471]  I hope that we're not, you know, predicting some kind of a doomsday event, you know?
[00:55:09.491 --> 00:55:17.576]  I mean, but folks, they're getting caught putting bird flu viruses in the bird flu vaccinations.
[00:55:17.656 --> 00:55:21.899]  Again, they figured it out because a subcontractor tested some of it out on a ferret and it killed it.
[00:55:23.018 --> 00:55:25.539]  This is totally being blacked out in the U.S.
[00:55:25.559 --> 00:55:26.399]  mainstream media.
[00:55:26.419 --> 00:55:34.641]  It was reported on over a week ago in the Canadian press, and some check papers and whatnot have picked it up, but where is it on Fox News?
[00:55:35.101 --> 00:55:39.622]  We saw a Bloomberg story yesterday, but we hit the link and it didn't bring us anywhere.
[00:55:40.582 --> 00:55:42.743]  So you gotta wonder, what is going on?
[00:55:44.531 --> 00:55:46.913]  We're about to have State Representative Susan Lin on.
[00:55:47.153 --> 00:55:53.437]  Susan Lin is a member of the Tennessee General Assembly, serving on the Commerce Committee and Chairman of the Government Operations Committee.
[00:55:53.457 --> 00:55:54.138]  She holds a B.S.
[00:55:54.158 --> 00:55:55.739]  in Economics and a minor in History.
[00:55:56.019 --> 00:56:03.244]  She is the Chairman of the American Legislative Exchange Council's Commerce Task Force, and she has introduced H.J.R.
[00:56:03.264 --> 00:56:08.688]  108 State Sovereignty Bill in Tennessee, so that should be a very interesting guest.
[00:56:09.188 --> 00:56:13.271]  I'm hoping all 50 states at some point do this, whether they all pass.
[00:56:14.332 --> 00:56:21.020]  We should have the resolutions out there to not only show people that we're very angry with what's going on, but let's get a couple W's.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.582]  Like I said, we need a few wins.
[00:56:22.662 --> 00:56:26.967]  You know, New Hampshire, I believe we had a caller in last night, they said it was like 220 to 150.
[00:56:27.047 --> 00:56:28.408]  It was an under 70 people difference.
[00:56:32.813 --> 00:56:36.915]  So hopefully they'll reintroduce that bill or reform it somehow and pass it.
[00:56:37.615 --> 00:56:40.857]  Again, you can't just listen to radio shows like this when you have to take action.
[00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:41.737]  That's what we're here for.
[00:56:41.757 --> 00:56:42.858]  We're here to tell you what's going on.
[00:56:43.078 --> 00:56:43.838]  We'll be back after this.
[00:56:43.878 --> 00:56:44.959]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:45.039 --> 00:56:45.959]  I am Jason Burmess.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:48.300]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:01.639 --> 00:57:04.922]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[00:57:05.182 --> 00:57:07.524]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?

[00:58:01.516 --> 00:58:07.919]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:08.279 --> 00:58:10.260]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:10.921 --> 00:58:11.941]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:12.482 --> 00:58:12.982]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:13.282 --> 00:58:14.162]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:14.182 --> 00:58:15.563]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:15.643 --> 00:58:17.324]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:17.624 --> 00:58:24.388]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:24.788 --> 00:58:25.228]  Some U.S.
[00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:30.931]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:31.611 --> 00:58:35.092]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:35.112 --> 00:58:45.335]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:58:45.575 --> 00:58:46.315]  Fabled enemies.
[00:58:46.796 --> 00:58:54.078]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:54.558 --> 00:58:57.919]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:59:01.499 --> 00:59:02.680]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:59:02.861 --> 00:59:05.123]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:59:05.284 --> 00:59:09.269]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:59:09.429 --> 00:59:11.271]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout...
[00:59:16.749 --> 00:59:25.372]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:59:25.592 --> 00:59:31.715]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:59:31.975 --> 00:59:35.356]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:59:35.576 --> 00:59:39.718]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:59:46.578 --> 00:59:46.918]  I think so.
[01:00:02.466 --> 01:00:04.647]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:05.248 --> 01:00:08.049]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.312 --> 01:00:27.533]  All right, folks, we are back.
[01:00:27.573 --> 01:00:28.813]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:28.893 --> 01:00:30.534]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in for Alex.
[01:00:30.634 --> 01:00:32.855]  Alex will be returning for the Sunday show.
[01:00:33.656 --> 01:00:39.099]  Remember, I'll be doing my own show, The Info Warrior, with Jason Bermas tonight, 9 to 12 Central Time.
[01:00:39.799 --> 01:00:48.323]  We now have State Representative Susan Lin on the line, and she has introduced Bill HJR 108 on state sovereignty in Tennessee.
[01:00:48.883 --> 01:00:51.785]  Susan, why don't you just review the bill and tell us why it's so important?
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.120]  Hi, how are you?
[01:00:54.521 --> 01:00:55.221]  Good, how are you?
[01:00:55.741 --> 01:00:56.402]  I'm very good.
[01:00:57.062 --> 01:01:09.348]  Well, I believe it's important because the federal government more and more is just usurping powers that belong to the state, and they are imposing mandates on us.
[01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:18.153]  And, you know, this isn't something that is only recent, although recently it is extreme, but this really has been happening for decades.
[01:01:18.892 --> 01:01:34.464]  And I think I just want Tennessee to join the movement of many other states to remind the federal government of state sovereignty and work towards reversing all of these mandates and violations of the Constitution.
[01:01:34.484 --> 01:01:37.867]  Well, this has absolutely been going on, you know, much...
[01:01:39.187 --> 01:01:49.898]  Much earlier than this current administration and even the administration before it, like you said, for decades, we've seen this incremental slide towards federal power and just the state's rights being eviscerated.
[01:01:49.938 --> 01:01:56.004]  But like you said, with this administration and what's coming down the line, it seems like they're going for a large power grab.
[01:01:56.324 --> 01:01:59.587]  And this is not the only resolution out there.
[01:01:59.607 --> 01:02:01.429]  There are many states that are trying this right now.
[01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:02.791]  I believe Texas is one of them.
[01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:04.833]  I think Colorado is one of them.
[01:02:04.873 --> 01:02:06.875]  I know that New Hampshire just had a vote and they lost.
[01:02:07.596 --> 01:02:09.358]  You know, why is it important to win?
[01:02:09.578 --> 01:02:10.519]  To get a couple wins?
[01:02:10.539 --> 01:02:13.162]  You know, I'm saying it's great that we're putting these bills out there.
[01:02:13.202 --> 01:02:18.468]  We're creating awareness of states' rights and, you know, saying, look, federal government doesn't have
[01:02:19.008 --> 01:02:20.348]  All the power that they say they do.
[01:02:20.388 --> 01:02:23.809]  You know, basically they'll just say, you know, we're the executives, we get to do what we want.
[01:02:24.029 --> 01:02:24.810]  But that's not the case.
[01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:27.210]  You know, we were supposed to have checks and balances in this country.
[01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:28.611]  There were three branches of government.
[01:02:28.971 --> 01:02:33.972]  But it seems like the populace has been so dumbed down, they can't even tell you what those three branches are.
[01:02:34.332 --> 01:02:36.073]  So, are we going to be able to win?
[01:02:36.093 --> 01:02:37.473]  I mean, a couple of these.
[01:02:37.493 --> 01:02:39.253]  Do you think we can win this one in Tennessee?
[01:02:40.194 --> 01:02:45.275]  Um, you know, I am currently, as you and I speak, I'm writing a letter to my colleague.
[01:02:46.133 --> 01:02:49.395]  I don't want them to view this as a partisan issue.
[01:02:49.495 --> 01:02:52.576]  In Tennessee, the House is very close.
[01:02:52.756 --> 01:02:56.238]  49 Republicans, I'm sorry, 50 Republicans, 49 Democrats.
[01:02:57.078 --> 01:03:03.962]  And I want them to see this as a federal issue, federalism issue, not a partisan issue.
[01:03:04.262 --> 01:03:06.163]  That's very, very important to me.
[01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:11.205]  I wish I had thought of filing something like this under the previous administration.
[01:03:11.565 --> 01:03:12.506]  I would have done it then.
[01:03:12.526 --> 01:03:14.547]  I did not.
[01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:16.311]  I don't know.
[01:03:33.948 --> 01:03:34.008]  I'm
[01:03:55.683 --> 01:04:00.344]  And I am just hoping that my colleagues will see this as an issue of federalism.
[01:04:00.364 --> 01:04:03.805]  You know, as state legislators, we have a right to make our own laws.
[01:04:04.285 --> 01:04:15.368]  These federal mandates that they put on us, they force us to change our laws to do what they want us to do, ties our hands, and it increases our budget, and it ties our hands for years and years.
[01:04:15.908 --> 01:04:22.090]  And as state legislators, you know, we have a right to make our own laws for the people of Tennessee.
[01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:23.330]  The people of Tennessee have the
[01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:36.496]  Well, more and more people are waking up to that fact.
[01:04:36.556 --> 01:04:44.323]  But, you know, from cradle to grave we're raised that, you know, the office of the presidency is the number one office and we should obey the federal government.
[01:04:44.363 --> 01:04:50.209]  And there's not a lot of states' rights taught in, you know, the middle schools and high schools and grade schools.
[01:04:50.749 --> 01:04:51.149]  Anymore.
[01:04:51.189 --> 01:04:52.190]  I mean, they're just not there.
[01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:55.672]  And you kind of have to wake people up and say, you know, everything's not the same.
[01:04:55.732 --> 01:05:02.336]  It's just like you go into another state, and the speed limit might be a little bit different, or the drug laws might be a little bit different.
[01:05:02.356 --> 01:05:04.277]  We might not have three strikes here.
[01:05:04.597 --> 01:05:06.798]  And that's why we have these states' rights, because
[01:05:07.899 --> 01:05:09.079]  You have a choice in this country.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.340]  You can move somewhere else.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.680]  You can abide by the laws.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:15.122]  But these guys want to come in and they want to federalize everything.
[01:05:15.402 --> 01:05:17.603]  What was it about this current administration?
[01:05:17.623 --> 01:05:19.043]  You said you thought about doing a bill.
[01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:21.644]  If you had thought about it, you would have done it in the last administration.
[01:05:21.664 --> 01:05:26.486]  But what is it with this administration that makes you so weary and now the time is right to put this out there?
[01:05:27.313 --> 01:05:30.276]  Oh good heavens, the advance of socialism.
[01:05:30.836 --> 01:05:35.580]  And I know the media is trying to get us all not to say that, but that's exactly what it is.
[01:05:36.001 --> 01:05:37.662]  I am a firm capitalist.
[01:05:37.802 --> 01:05:49.212]  I am just very firm in our republic and our form of government, which is capitalism, our economic system.
[01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:50.894]  Very, very firm in that.
[01:05:50.994 --> 01:05:52.255]  I know it is the best thing
[01:05:55.854 --> 01:05:56.635]  We're good to go.
[01:06:15.902 --> 01:06:24.945]  Economies go through cycles, and you can call it the business cycle, you can call it the credit cycle, whatever you want, but it really is the credit cycle.
[01:06:24.965 --> 01:06:38.350]  And what happens is, it's just very typical, people tend to max out on credit, and so, you know, the economy's good, everybody's spending and borrowing and spending and borrowing, and we get to the point where everybody maxes out, and then it's like a hangover.
[01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:41.251]  We are really overdone at this time.
[01:06:41.271 --> 01:06:42.531]  We are in a huge hangover.
[01:06:42.961 --> 01:07:01.736]  But instead of the federal government lowering our taxes and providing the opportunity for people to pay down debt, and those who didn't go into extraordinary debt to invest that money in opportunities and to start, you know, the cycle all over, creating jobs and getting people back to work.
[01:07:01.956 --> 01:07:11.544]  Instead of doing that, what they have chosen to do is tax us more, to spend more money on programs that don't produce anything.
[01:07:12.385 --> 01:07:19.588]  It's not like, you know, you're taking a hunk of rock, getting metal out of it, and turning that metal into something more valuable.
[01:07:19.908 --> 01:07:20.849]  That's not what they're doing.
[01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:24.410]  They're simply spending money on things that are then gone.
[01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:32.493]  We need people to invest in America and create jobs to spend money on things that actually take a raw material and produce something else.
[01:07:33.294 --> 01:07:35.635]  That's not going to happen under this.
[01:07:35.715 --> 01:07:41.137]  Investors are very weary, they're scared, and they are losing their ability to invest
[01:07:41.747 --> 01:07:47.870]  And then the people, the ordinary people, they don't have the money to pay off their debt.
[01:07:48.351 --> 01:07:51.172]  They are suffering and more and more they are losing their jobs.
[01:07:52.153 --> 01:07:56.755]  We need the taxes lowered so that people can pay down debt and get this going again.
[01:07:56.775 --> 01:08:00.357]  This plan that they're doing will not get us going again.
[01:08:00.964 --> 01:08:05.287]  Well, you mentioned that this was a socialist plan, and you said, you know, the media is trying to really cover that up.
[01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:06.668]  I don't see it that way at all.
[01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:16.114]  I mean, I look at Newsweek's cover just three weeks ago, and you have a red hand shaking a blue hand, and the title of the article, or the cover, is, We Are All Socialists Now.
[01:08:16.514 --> 01:08:25.080]  So if people aren't getting that the federal government, in this time when people are losing their jobs more than ever, I got an article here, they're admitting 651,000 job losses in February alone.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.141]  It's the worst in 25 years.
[01:08:30.203 --> 01:08:34.346]  And, you know, he says, oh, we're going to build all these programs and we're going to build infrastructure.
[01:08:34.386 --> 01:08:34.867]  Where is it?
[01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:36.508]  You know, where are these programs?
[01:08:36.628 --> 01:08:39.710]  And where, like you said, we don't build anything in this country anymore.
[01:08:39.790 --> 01:08:43.013]  It seems like the last industry that we had was the auto industry.
[01:08:43.353 --> 01:08:44.954]  And now GM is saying, you know what?
[01:08:44.974 --> 01:08:47.536]  We need another three point five billion dollars or we're not going to make it.
[01:08:47.996 --> 01:08:49.598]  So how are we going to turn this around?
[01:08:49.618 --> 01:08:52.360]  You know what?
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.221]  I just see a lot of stuff.
[01:08:56.596 --> 01:08:56.656]  The
[01:09:14.091 --> 01:09:16.712]  We need a deregulation stimulus package.
[01:09:17.133 --> 01:09:31.639]  There are so many things that the state literally owns title to, and what I mean by that is occupational licensure, where you cannot work in a specific occupation without getting a license from the state.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:40.924]  You can't call yourself a certain title, like a private investigator or something, without literally getting a license from the state to do that.
[01:09:42.131 --> 01:09:47.076]  If you look at these licensure laws, you will see there's so many hoops that people have to jump through just to work.
[01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:56.884]  And so, you know, while we, in Tennessee, we have a sales tax system, it's, you know, we don't have an income tax that we could lower or anything like that.
[01:09:57.145 --> 01:10:06.553]  But what we can do is enact some deregulation to help people get working again, to make it easier for people to work instead of jumping through hoops.
[01:10:08.044 --> 01:10:17.910]  That is what I'm trying to do in Tennessee, but overall in the federal government, we need them to stop spending money on these ridiculous, wasteful things.
[01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.890]  Lower taxes.
[01:10:20.191 --> 01:10:24.033]  What could be any better than them lowering the capital gains tax right now?
[01:10:24.774 --> 01:10:27.175]  Lowering income tax rates right now.
[01:10:28.216 --> 01:10:29.957]  Business tax rates right now.
[01:10:30.437 --> 01:10:32.118]  It would sure spur the economy.
[01:10:32.758 --> 01:10:34.459]  The spending that they have
[01:10:35.945 --> 01:10:36.425]  I don't know.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.923]  We don't need money like that.
[01:11:05.804 --> 01:11:07.225]  We are Tennesseans.
[01:11:07.746 --> 01:11:14.433]  We have the right to make our own laws and to run our own unemployment system according to the way that we think it ought to be run.
[01:11:14.794 --> 01:11:20.740]  And we don't need the federal government ordering us on how to run programs such as that.
[01:11:21.161 --> 01:11:22.082]  How can people support you?
[01:11:22.122 --> 01:11:23.884]  Is there a website or a phone number they can call?
[01:11:25.309 --> 01:11:28.357]  Um, well, I have a website.
[01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:32.710]  You can just Google me, Susan Lin, or RepSusanLin.com.
[01:11:33.658 --> 01:11:36.701]  And then also I have a blog on Blogspot.
[01:11:37.341 --> 01:11:38.762]  So I can be found on Blogspot.
[01:11:39.123 --> 01:11:40.504]  Alright, thank you so much, Susan Lynn.
[01:11:40.524 --> 01:11:41.925]  This is something that we'll be looking at.
[01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:44.147]  Remember, states' rights are important.
[01:11:44.187 --> 01:11:45.488]  We need people to get behind this.
[01:11:45.528 --> 01:11:46.428]  We need a couple W's.
[01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:47.289]  We need to pass this.
[01:11:47.329 --> 01:11:48.230]  We need to get this through.
[01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:50.872]  We need to say the federal government is not God.
[01:11:50.912 --> 01:11:52.073]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:11:52.133 --> 01:11:53.074]  I am Jason Bermas.
[01:11:53.114 --> 01:11:54.275]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:54.535 --> 01:11:55.476]  InfoWars.com.
[01:12:02.279 --> 01:12:06.102]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.
[01:12:06.422 --> 01:12:12.207]  Right now at MainMilitary.com you'll find savings on the top must-have military supplies.
[01:12:12.587 --> 01:12:14.568]  M10 gas masks for $12 or 3 for $30.
[01:12:14.708 --> 01:12:15.649]  Gas mask hoods $4 or 3 for $10.
[01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:17.190]  Mask filters $6 or 3 for $15.
[01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:18.791]  Save big on British chemical suits only $12.
[01:12:18.831 --> 01:12:19.232]  Israeli gas masks $20.
[01:12:26.297 --> 01:12:29.680]  Trigger finger gloves, five dollars a pair or thirty six dollars a dozen.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.082]  Snowshoe binding for eight dollars or forty eight dollars a dozen.
[01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:34.303]  And so much more.
[01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:38.026]  Even hard to find surplus items, all at surplus prices.
[01:12:38.306 --> 01:12:41.088]  Preparing the whole family has never been so affordable.
[01:12:41.328 --> 01:12:42.109]  That's right.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.303]  Hello, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources, and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:18.492]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous freefall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[01:13:18.933 --> 01:13:23.956]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[01:13:24.517 --> 01:13:25.978]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[01:13:26.511 --> 01:13:32.538]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[01:13:33.178 --> 01:13:36.963]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[01:13:37.503 --> 01:13:38.224]  Give me a call.
[01:13:38.284 --> 01:13:41.708]  I'm Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108, and allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[01:13:47.034 --> 01:13:51.757]  That's Peter Kranschnabel at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:13:52.837 --> 01:13:59.842]  Call Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108, where you can still purchase gold with paper.
[01:14:01.583 --> 01:14:07.086]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:14:07.306 --> 01:14:08.627]  And we knew what to do.
[01:14:08.647 --> 01:14:10.388]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:14:10.648 --> 01:14:15.671]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[01:14:16.104 --> 01:14:17.025]  To tell their story.
[01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:26.200]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:33.352]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:14:33.652 --> 01:14:36.712]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:14:36.832 --> 01:14:42.034]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:14:42.594 --> 01:14:45.234]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:14:45.674 --> 01:14:52.656]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:55.621]  We're good to go.
[01:15:00.962 --> 01:15:05.805]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system, new from HempUSA.org.
[01:15:06.005 --> 01:15:14.409]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:19.312]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[01:15:19.552 --> 01:15:26.356]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[01:15:26.616 --> 01:15:32.817]  This water system will descale all piping, hot water heaters, and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[01:15:32.997 --> 01:15:43.840]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins, with extreme positive effects on plants, vegetables, and fruits.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:48.781]  Improved taste, color, size, and yield with approximately 30% less water usage.
[01:15:48.921 --> 01:15:52.442]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[01:15:52.702 --> 01:15:56.204]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:15:56.464 --> 01:15:59.026]  That's 908-691-2608.
[01:15:59.106 --> 01:16:07.811]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:08.491 --> 01:16:10.772]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:16:24.272 --> 01:16:25.333]  Is the Pink Panther here?
[01:16:25.573 --> 01:16:26.414]  Did he get here, really?
[01:16:26.434 --> 01:16:27.735]  Yeah?
[01:16:29.436 --> 01:16:29.696]  Yeah.
[01:16:29.937 --> 01:16:30.777]  Oh, Pink Panther?
[01:16:30.957 --> 01:16:31.418]  Get out of here.
[01:16:31.438 --> 01:16:32.359]  Peter Sellers, man.
[01:16:32.419 --> 01:16:32.999]  He's the man.
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.361]  I used to watch the cartoon all the time.
[01:16:35.581 --> 01:16:37.483]  I wasn't as big into the Pink Panther.
[01:16:37.503 --> 01:16:38.984]  I don't know about the new Steve Martin ones.
[01:16:39.104 --> 01:16:40.125]  I caught a little bit of it.
[01:16:40.145 --> 01:16:41.286]  Doesn't look that appealing.
[01:16:41.586 --> 01:16:43.828]  I'm getting a no-go from my producers.
[01:16:44.748 --> 01:16:49.052]  I want to remind everybody that the Midas Resources Gold Special that we were running.
[01:16:49.973 --> 01:16:52.335]  Ted was on earlier, but that's going to run all the way through Sunday.
[01:16:53.587 --> 01:16:54.628]  So get it while you can.
[01:16:54.648 --> 01:16:55.969]  Again, gold up today.
[01:16:56.289 --> 01:16:58.711]  He's locking them in at the Monday or Tuesday prices.
[01:16:58.731 --> 01:17:03.776]  And today, I believe, last time we checked, it was at like $9.42 or $9.45.
[01:17:04.196 --> 01:17:05.277]  So gold on the rise.
[01:17:06.458 --> 01:17:19.729]  Before I take more callers, and we're going to blitz through your phone calls, Kim, Nick, Forrest, Tom, and others, I wanted to point out that the Obama administration loves, loves, loves
[01:17:20.871 --> 01:17:22.332]  To not waste a good crisis.
[01:17:23.053 --> 01:17:24.434]  Never waste a good crisis!
[01:17:24.454 --> 01:17:28.357]  We had Rahm Emanuel get up there and say, you know what, you never want to waste a good crisis.
[01:17:29.017 --> 01:17:30.218]  Talking about the economy.
[01:17:30.258 --> 01:17:33.080]  Well now, Clinton on climate.
[01:17:33.641 --> 01:17:34.822]  Never waste a good crisis.
[01:17:34.842 --> 01:17:42.908]  There is no crisis except for the calamity of a media crisis that you've put out and saying, oh no, we're all going to die.
[01:17:43.488 --> 01:17:44.449]  Oh, it's global warming.
[01:17:44.489 --> 01:17:45.629]  Well, it's not global warming.
[01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:50.651]  It's global climate change, and we're bad carbon emitters, and we need to get greener.
[01:17:51.492 --> 01:18:04.418]  So, of course, Clinton was over in Global Warming Happy Europe, over at the EU-US conference, and she's just like, you know, Europe, the United States, and China, we can all work together.
[01:18:04.898 --> 01:18:06.759]  We can bring in the greener jobs.
[01:18:06.799 --> 01:18:09.500]  We don't have to be these bad, bad carbon emitters.
[01:18:10.182 --> 01:18:13.844]  Folks, watch the Great Global Warming Swindle because it is a swindle.
[01:18:15.705 --> 01:18:24.290]  Myself included was indoctrinated into this culture of global warming and you really think that it's real and man is bad and all this other just bull.
[01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:25.890]  Yeah, we can pollute the earth.
[01:18:25.931 --> 01:18:30.353]  Yes, people, you know, dunk toxic chemicals into the ocean and lakes and that's bad news, Brown.
[01:18:30.853 --> 01:18:35.436]  But are we having a huge effect on the sun and its cycles?
[01:18:35.536 --> 01:18:35.836]  No!
[01:18:36.156 --> 01:18:39.178]  They were teaching global cooling to the generation before us.
[01:18:39.878 --> 01:18:41.999]  They're like, it'll get too cold, we'll all die!
[01:18:42.019 --> 01:18:42.920]  The Earth changes.
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.781]  It's always changed throughout time.
[01:18:45.041 --> 01:18:46.162]  It was once Pangea.
[01:18:46.482 --> 01:18:53.426]  It's time to own up to the fact that we are not the ones creating, quote-unquote, global warming.
[01:18:53.786 --> 01:18:54.226]  It's both.
[01:18:55.127 --> 01:18:57.668]  Alright, let's jump to our next caller.
[01:18:57.728 --> 01:18:59.609]  Let's go to Kim in Seattle.
[01:18:59.669 --> 01:19:00.450]  Kim, what's on your mind?
[01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:02.451]  Hey, Jason, can you hear me?
[01:19:02.851 --> 01:19:03.591]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:19:03.611 --> 01:19:07.854]  Okay, um, I wanted to say that for anyone that knows history,
[01:19:08.793 --> 01:19:19.421]  The history of World War II and the First Great Depression, it is obvious that they are using this economic downfall as a big false flag to start World War III.
[01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:22.743]  To me, it is very obvious that they're doing this.
[01:19:23.224 --> 01:19:26.466]  All you have to do is look at history, and it's a pattern of what they're doing.
[01:19:26.486 --> 01:19:29.248]  And for everyone out there saying, oh, what do we do?
[01:19:29.288 --> 01:19:29.869]  What do we do?
[01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:30.869]  It's easy.
[01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:35.833]  Stop going to the bars, wasting all your money and time on alcohol and drugs.
[01:19:36.482 --> 01:19:42.364]  Get out there, make a flyer, pass it around, do something besides sitting and complaining.
[01:19:42.404 --> 01:19:44.345]  That does nothing to do.
[01:19:44.865 --> 01:19:45.506]  Well, I agree there.
[01:19:45.546 --> 01:19:51.608]  I mean, there are a lot of whiners and complainers out there, but if we just took the model that Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:19:51.668 --> 01:19:56.910]  presented, and that was to get out into the streets and communicate one-on-one with people, I think we've lost that.
[01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:59.371]  You know, especially in this internet age society.
[01:19:59.411 --> 01:20:03.253]  And like you said, you know what, they write about it in 1984, the proletariat is the only
[01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:17.859]  portion of the population that's happy because they are in the bars and they don't keep up on politics and they are living in this like mindless wonder world and unfortunately I see that about 60 or 70 percent of the populace in this country.
[01:20:19.059 --> 01:20:30.503]  Yeah, it's really scary like almost everyone I know all they do is drink and go to the bars and that's it and I'm like alone here in my struggle in Seattle and it's just it's just really sad.
[01:20:30.523 --> 01:20:35.045]  You know, if you don't, if people don't want World War III they really need to wake up.
[01:20:35.506 --> 01:20:37.106]  Because that's exactly what's going to happen.
[01:20:37.127 --> 01:20:43.188]  They're going to put us in a Great Depression, and then they're going to use a war to bring us out of it, just like they did the last time.
[01:20:43.388 --> 01:20:43.789]  You know what?
[01:20:43.829 --> 01:20:44.209]  That's true.
[01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:53.351]  They always blow out economies before they blow each other up, and that is how it works, so that they can get those economies going again, and they can have people unify for the common cause.
[01:20:53.391 --> 01:20:54.512]  I thank you for the call, Kim.
[01:20:55.032 --> 01:20:55.792]  She makes a good point.
[01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:58.693]  Alright, let's go to Nick in Massachusetts.
[01:20:58.773 --> 01:20:59.613]  Nick, what's on your mind?
[01:21:00.354 --> 01:21:00.934]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:21:01.434 --> 01:21:01.794]  Good, man.
[01:21:02.394 --> 01:21:03.915]  Congratulations on your new show, man.
[01:21:04.235 --> 01:21:04.695]  Well, thank you.
[01:21:05.683 --> 01:21:14.594]  Alright, well, the call that was earlier today, I don't know what he was talking about with the whole Islam came from...
[01:21:15.794 --> 01:21:18.616]  It came from the Vatican and stuff like that.
[01:21:18.636 --> 01:21:24.059]  There's this group of people out there that want to blame everything on a small group of people.
[01:21:24.139 --> 01:21:33.585]  And when I hear the Vatican stuff, I've got to hear these ridiculous rumors that Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen are both actually Jesuit priests working for the Vatican Order.
[01:21:33.645 --> 01:21:35.086]  And I'm like, no they're not!
[01:21:36.187 --> 01:21:39.748]  These guys are probably just Catholics.
[01:21:39.768 --> 01:21:41.409]  They're not heavy into the Jesuit order.
[01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:44.210]  I have to hear that Alex Jones is a Vatican assassin.
[01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:45.611]  It's absolute Johnny nonsense.
[01:21:46.031 --> 01:21:47.372]  We'll come back to you on the other side.
[01:21:47.392 --> 01:21:48.412]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:48.472 --> 01:21:50.473]  I am Jason Burmas, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:21:51.513 --> 01:21:52.394]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.894 --> 01:21:54.494]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:55.435 --> 01:21:58.116]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:01.641 --> 01:22:04.583]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:22:04.743 --> 01:22:10.006]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:22:10.266 --> 01:22:15.609]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:17.110]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:22:17.471 --> 01:22:26.376]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:22:26.776 --> 01:22:28.397]  Now compare a Cal Bend Pure Soap.
[01:22:28.617 --> 01:22:32.780]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:23:01.465 --> 01:23:07.875]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:23:08.236 --> 01:23:09.898]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:10.874 --> 01:23:11.895]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:12.416 --> 01:23:12.916]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:13.216 --> 01:23:14.017]  This is his MO.
[01:23:14.037 --> 01:23:15.539]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:15.579 --> 01:23:17.260]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:17.581 --> 01:23:24.327]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:24.728 --> 01:23:25.168]  Some U.S.
[01:23:25.208 --> 01:23:30.854]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:31.534 --> 01:23:34.996]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:35.016 --> 01:23:37.197]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.202]  Do you depend on the grocery store for your food?
[01:24:03.582 --> 01:24:05.363]  It's time to think outside the box.
[01:24:05.744 --> 01:24:07.445]  How about starting your own garden?
[01:24:07.705 --> 01:24:09.807]  To ensure your future, you purchase the seeds.
[01:24:09.967 --> 01:24:12.610]  To get the most out of your investment, you need the fertilizer.
[01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:17.894]  Whether or not you have good or bad soil, liquidorganicfertilizer.com has the solution.

[01:25:33.251 --> 01:25:35.332]  Alright, it's the Alex Jones Show and we are back.
[01:25:35.572 --> 01:25:36.373]  We're taking callers.
[01:25:36.393 --> 01:25:37.933]  We're on the line with Nick in Massachusetts.
[01:25:37.953 --> 01:25:41.355]  We're going to be going to Forrest, Tom, Caroline, and others.
[01:25:42.375 --> 01:25:46.858]  And getting back to this whole, you know, Jesuit Vatican thing.
[01:25:46.938 --> 01:25:47.198]  I mean,
[01:25:48.424 --> 01:25:56.190]  There are people out there that say that, you know, Alex is a Vatican assassin and there's no way that he could have been able to get into the Bohemian Grove without the help of the Jesuit Order.
[01:25:56.250 --> 01:26:09.622]  And, you know, looking at it from the inside, especially an insider that, you know, didn't spend my life, you know, in this information, only woke up after 9-11, I can tell you right now that Jones is no Vatican assassin, okay?
[01:26:09.662 --> 01:26:11.263]  He's a regular family guy.
[01:26:11.943 --> 01:26:14.806]  And the way he was able to get into Bohemian Grove was with the help
[01:26:15.426 --> 01:26:21.971]  Of Trio Network over in Europe, which was this news station, and a very determined young journalist named John Ronson.
[01:26:22.051 --> 01:26:29.195]  Ronson has later on kind of gone tongue-in-cheek to talk about the New World Order, do a couple of books.
[01:26:29.576 --> 01:26:38.061]  He's a little critical, but he admits to the Bilderberg Group and One World Government, and was shocked at what Jones shot inside the Grove.
[01:26:38.802 --> 01:26:44.426]  So, you know, again, when people are always, it's this group or that group, you know, they all work together.
[01:26:45.578 --> 01:26:52.883]  And the group that I would be worried about are the ones that are publicly out there talking about a one world government, a one world economy.
[01:26:53.777 --> 01:27:09.152]  A global currency, a quote-unquote New World Order, and when you get into, you know, the Vatican did this, or the Jesuits did that, or the Zionists did this, I think you really muddy the waters, man, and especially for someone like you that has never heard this stuff.
[01:27:09.192 --> 01:27:11.614]  I mean, there are just vicious attackers.
[01:27:11.654 --> 01:27:15.178]  I mean, there are people out there that say that I'm some kind of a Mossad agent.
[01:27:15.618 --> 01:27:17.198]  You know, I've never been to Israel in my life.
[01:27:17.419 --> 01:27:20.199]  I've never been inside of a... What are they?
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:22.500]  I know it's the Torah.
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.240]  What is it?
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:24.380]  Synagogue.
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:24.841]  That's it.
[01:27:24.941 --> 01:27:26.021]  I think there's another thing for it.
[01:27:26.061 --> 01:27:26.361]  Temple.
[01:27:26.401 --> 01:27:27.421]  I've never been to Temple either.
[01:27:27.441 --> 01:27:28.442]  You know, I have no idea.
[01:27:28.722 --> 01:27:34.903]  I think the closest thing to Judaism that I've ever come in contact with is I went to a couple of half-Jewish weddings.
[01:27:35.423 --> 01:27:35.764]  You know?
[01:27:36.424 --> 01:27:44.746]  So, you know, people try to make links where there aren't any, and some people are just overly paranoid, and in other cases they're just disingenuous, Nick.
[01:27:46.883 --> 01:27:47.283]  Still with us?
[01:27:48.203 --> 01:27:48.804]  Yeah, I'm still with you.
[01:27:49.684 --> 01:27:52.345]  So, you know, I mean, I've never heard that either.
[01:27:52.565 --> 01:27:59.567]  And, you know, like I said earlier in the week, I had G. Edward Griffin, you know, openly talking about how some of these roundtable groups were based on the Jesuit order.
[01:27:59.587 --> 01:28:03.028]  I had Mark Dice on, you know, talking about the occult.
[01:28:03.068 --> 01:28:07.290]  And I also had Tex Marzon last night, you know, talking about this whole thing as well.
[01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:07.930]  So, you know,
[01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:11.892]  It also bothers me when people say, oh, you're covering this up or you're covering that up.
[01:28:11.932 --> 01:28:12.973]  This is a news program.
[01:28:13.073 --> 01:28:29.024]  You know, of course we go into the esoteric nature of it sometimes, but at the same time, we're more interested in reporting on what's going on in the vaccinations in Pakistan and in our own country than, you know, what may or may not have happened hundreds or thousands of years ago.
[01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:35.608]  Yeah, well, I just wanted to clear it up because I'm Muslim myself, so it's like when I hear like attacks like this, like
[01:28:36.124 --> 01:28:54.499]  You know it's like the truth is always attacked and discredited you know Alex goes out and he's always attacked and discredited so it's like I want people to realize that Islam is not it's not like one of these like hocus-pocus religions like like you think Islam so you think like Hindu or Buddhism or something like this it's
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.262]  It's nothing like that whatsoever.
[01:28:56.302 --> 01:29:00.527]  It has strong ties to, like, the same things that Christians believe.
[01:29:00.727 --> 01:29:01.388]  Yeah, very similar.
[01:29:01.428 --> 01:29:10.860]  And Jews believe, and I want people to understand that because there has been a lot of attacks against Islam, and I want people to, like, understand, like, why do you think this is, you know?
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:12.461]  Yeah, like they always are.
[01:29:12.561 --> 01:29:19.566]  Islam being attacked, you know, like you said, Judaism and Christianity, and those are basically, you know, one God religions.
[01:29:19.606 --> 01:29:27.813]  And you look at something like, you know, Buddhism, which is really all about inner enlightenment and nirvana and bringing yourself into that and very New Age-y in itself.
[01:29:28.853 --> 01:29:31.895]  You know, Hinduism is the worship of many gods.
[01:29:31.975 --> 01:29:34.836]  You know, Vishnu, Shiva, and many others.
[01:29:34.876 --> 01:29:37.698]  So this is a multi-faceted religion as well.
[01:29:38.158 --> 01:29:44.361]  And, you know, Islam does share more in common with both Christianity and Judaism than any other religions.
[01:29:44.581 --> 01:29:45.422]  I thank you for the call.
[01:29:45.762 --> 01:29:48.443]  Let's jump to Forrest in California.
[01:29:48.543 --> 01:29:49.544]  Forrest, what's on your mind?
[01:29:50.264 --> 01:29:51.385]  Yes, sir, Jason.
[01:29:51.445 --> 01:29:57.568]  I would like to talk about things we can do with this information that you and Alex present on a daily basis to save humanity in America.
[01:29:58.570 --> 01:30:01.092]  In other words, fighting the New World Order.
[01:30:01.693 --> 01:30:07.857]  We all know about letting people know about Fable Enemies and Endgame, 9-11 Chronicles, and the Police State videos.
[01:30:08.437 --> 01:30:13.381]  Another thing we can do is also believe without a doubt.
[01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:20.506]  Have that infinite faith energy, just like if a baseball team is down three games to one in a seven-game series.
[01:30:20.566 --> 01:30:21.227]  Have that faith.
[01:30:22.007 --> 01:30:27.431]  There are times where it may feel like we're down, but knowing without a doubt that we're going to win this thing.
[01:30:28.679 --> 01:30:30.480]  The Law of Attraction.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:40.066]  I'm not big into the New Agey stuff, or the movie or book out there is called The Secret, but the Law of Attraction is absolutely 110% real.
[01:30:40.546 --> 01:30:45.189]  And if you believe in something enough, and it's not just believing or saying it, you have to work towards it as well.
[01:30:45.630 --> 01:30:54.656]  You can't just have that belief, but you come at it with that positive attitude, with that can-do attitude, that never-say-die attitude, and then you actually put the efforts forth.
[01:30:55.296 --> 01:30:56.216]  You march forward.
[01:30:56.596 --> 01:30:57.377]  You do something.
[01:30:57.437 --> 01:30:58.897]  You act constructively.
[01:30:59.077 --> 01:31:01.198]  You don't just sit there and say, well, I thought about it.
[01:31:01.218 --> 01:31:01.918]  I'm pouting and whining.
[01:31:01.938 --> 01:31:03.739]  No, you have to come at it full force.
[01:31:03.759 --> 01:31:04.799]  You have to believe in yourself.
[01:31:04.819 --> 01:31:06.240]  You have to go in there with confidence.
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:10.541]  And like you said, we have to believe that we can make a difference and win, Forrest.
[01:31:11.201 --> 01:31:11.582]  Yes, sir.
[01:31:12.562 --> 01:31:20.405]  And also, there's been scientific studies that have found that people who write down their personal goals are the ones who accomplish them.
[01:31:21.727 --> 01:31:26.671]  I believe that through just a prayer, just like writing down affirmatively that we have all saved America.
[01:31:27.371 --> 01:31:32.856]  And you and your team of hundreds of millions who have always remembered 9-11.
[01:31:33.156 --> 01:31:36.378]  I mean, y'all are the most patriotic Americans I could think of.
[01:31:36.699 --> 01:31:41.142]  I mean, all these bumper stickers, t-shirts that say, God bless America, peace on Earth, Jesus loves you.
[01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:44.004]  I mean, y'all are like modern day Christ figures.
[01:31:44.044 --> 01:31:47.067]  You and Lindsay Williams, Jeff Williams, Jim Maher, Steve Quayle.
[01:31:47.547 --> 01:31:51.330]  I mean, y'all are like blessed peacemakers and sons of God.
[01:31:51.963 --> 01:31:52.543]  Well, thank you, man.
[01:31:52.563 --> 01:31:53.964]  That's a great compliment.
[01:31:53.984 --> 01:31:55.225]  I thank you for the call, Forrest.
[01:31:56.206 --> 01:31:56.946]  He makes a great point.
[01:31:56.966 --> 01:32:01.489]  You know, he also just said there, another part of the Law of Attraction, the people that do often write down their goals.
[01:32:01.569 --> 01:32:04.431]  Well, in the film, The Secret,
[01:32:05.327 --> 01:32:15.113]  They talk about this vision board and you make this vision board and it's been made fun of and it's been on Oprah and one of the shows I like, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, has kind of poked fun at it.
[01:32:15.474 --> 01:32:29.343]  But it is true that when you envision something and you put it on paper and it's in your mind and you see it daily and you work towards it, you send out an energy force into the universe and it may not be returned all the time,
[01:32:29.983 --> 01:32:32.945]  But you've got a better shot at being returned if you're working towards it.
[01:32:34.507 --> 01:32:35.267]  I'm with this guy.
[01:32:35.287 --> 01:32:37.769]  You've got to believe you can win.
[01:32:37.809 --> 01:32:38.530]  You've got to believe.
[01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:40.651]  You've got to be confident in what you're doing.
[01:32:40.872 --> 01:32:41.792]  That's how you bring people in.
[01:32:41.832 --> 01:32:46.836]  Nobody wants to hear, well, you know, this is how it is in the new world.
[01:32:47.077 --> 01:32:48.077]  And they're going to chip in.
[01:32:48.097 --> 01:32:50.439]  And they're going to blow the economy.
[01:32:50.539 --> 01:32:51.940]  We're going to be in a camp.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:52.881]  No one wants to hear that.
[01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:54.462]  You've got to slow it down.
[01:32:55.023 --> 01:32:55.363]  Slow it down.
[01:32:55.383 --> 01:32:56.584]  First, you've got to know what you're talking about.
[01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:57.125]  You've got to say, hey,
[01:32:57.785 --> 01:32:59.886]  You know, look at the power structure.
[01:32:59.926 --> 01:33:02.147]  Has it really changed in the last couple hundred years?
[01:33:02.527 --> 01:33:02.807]  Really?
[01:33:02.827 --> 01:33:05.388]  And you say, just look at the last 10 or 20 years.
[01:33:05.408 --> 01:33:07.910]  Look who's been in power in the United States openly.
[01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:11.351]  You mentioned the Bush and Clinton crime syndicate.
[01:33:11.391 --> 01:33:12.692]  And you say, you know, Bush family.
[01:33:12.732 --> 01:33:13.812]  I mean, there's a family right there.
[01:33:13.832 --> 01:33:14.533]  It's a dynasty.
[01:33:14.553 --> 01:33:16.013]  I mean, it's George H.W.
[01:33:16.053 --> 01:33:16.313]  Bush.
[01:33:16.353 --> 01:33:17.754]  He's the head of the CIA.
[01:33:17.774 --> 01:33:18.835]  Then he's the vice president.
[01:33:18.855 --> 01:33:19.655]  Then he's the president.
[01:33:20.779 --> 01:33:22.040]  He's a close advisor to Clinton.
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:24.321]  A lot of people don't know that, but Clinton and George H.W.
[01:33:24.341 --> 01:33:32.225]  Bush had a very close relationship back in Bush's days at the CIA and Vice President while Clinton was in Arkansas as the Governor.
[01:33:33.005 --> 01:33:34.726]  And then it goes from Clinton to Bush's son.
[01:33:35.913 --> 01:33:36.493]  Coincidence?
[01:33:36.573 --> 01:33:37.614]  I mean, is that a coincidence?
[01:33:37.634 --> 01:33:41.777]  And then you explain to them that the Bush... Well, where does the Bush family fortune come from?
[01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:45.359]  Nine times out of ten, people are going to go, well, that's easy.
[01:33:45.379 --> 01:33:47.400]  That's, you know, oil and weapons.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:47.961]  Duh.
[01:33:48.141 --> 01:33:49.301]  It's oil and weapons, man.
[01:33:49.662 --> 01:33:54.024]  And you go, well, you know, they made some money in oil and weapons, but that's not how they made their fortune.
[01:33:54.405 --> 01:33:55.505]  Well, how'd they do it then?
[01:33:56.366 --> 01:34:00.549]  Well, actually, Prescott Bush, who was a senator in this country in the
[01:34:02.489 --> 01:34:06.732]  Current president, no longer current president, W's grandfather, George H.W.'
[01:34:06.712 --> 01:34:10.754]  's father, he was arrested under the Trading with the Enemies Act.
[01:34:13.095 --> 01:34:13.355]  What?
[01:34:13.696 --> 01:34:14.096]  What trading?
[01:34:14.116 --> 01:34:15.216]  What was he trading?
[01:34:15.497 --> 01:34:16.797]  Well, he was trading Nazi gold.
[01:34:17.658 --> 01:34:25.502]  He was running a Nazi money laundering from before the Nazis were in power, after the Nazis, I think 30s to 50s.
[01:34:25.542 --> 01:34:30.505]  I think it was like 35 to 52 through Averill Harriman Corporation and Union Banking.
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:37.042]  And then, they took their little Nazi money, and they invested in oil and weapons, and they made money.
[01:34:37.862 --> 01:34:39.323]  Well, man, that's just crazy.
[01:34:40.043 --> 01:34:53.188]  And you know, this Bush guy, the elder Bush, he's constantly calling for this New World Order, and him and Cheney, when Cheney was his Secretary of Defense, actually went before the United Nations and passed resolutions on this thing.
[01:34:53.768 --> 01:34:54.448]  Get out of here!
[01:34:55.148 --> 01:34:56.589]  And you just take it slow, you know?
[01:34:56.609 --> 01:34:57.909]  You gotta be confident.
[01:34:58.049 --> 01:34:59.190]  You gotta look somebody in the eye.
[01:34:59.890 --> 01:35:03.072]  It doesn't hurt to have a computer next to you either and being able to pull all this stuff up.
[01:35:03.232 --> 01:35:04.272]  It's the information age.
[01:35:04.732 --> 01:35:06.573]  You know, even your phone now gets internet.
[01:35:07.053 --> 01:35:19.359]  Pull it up to your, most, not most phones, but most of the newer phones, you can literally pull YouTube clips off the net through your G or 3G network or edge network or whatever and show it to them right on the spot.
[01:35:19.839 --> 01:35:22.100]  And that's the way, that's the way we can change things.
[01:35:22.241 --> 01:35:23.061]  Instant information.
[01:35:23.761 --> 01:35:26.402]  Alright, let's go to Tom in New Jersey.
[01:35:26.443 --> 01:35:27.243]  Tom, what's on your mind?
[01:35:28.123 --> 01:35:28.923]  Yeah, hi Jason.
[01:35:29.203 --> 01:35:35.766]  I'm not sure everybody's going to understand what I've got to say, but it's got to be out there.
[01:35:38.066 --> 01:35:44.128]  The Illuminists have had their One World Religion in place for quite a long time now.
[01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:57.573]  If you look to the Bible, the book of actually Judaism, all throughout the book except for one writer who came
[01:35:58.306 --> 01:36:01.247]  After the Messiah, who didn't even know the Messiah.
[01:36:02.567 --> 01:36:06.028]  And this is Saul, who came from Tarsus.
[01:36:07.088 --> 01:36:09.749]  He is the Illuminist henchman.
[01:36:11.269 --> 01:36:18.791]  And he wrote 13 letters, and actually he added to John, letters of John and Peter.
[01:36:19.951 --> 01:36:21.712]  There's been a lot of information on the subject.
[01:36:22.252 --> 01:36:26.333]  If you guys want to go to Sauloperative on YouTube,
[01:36:27.628 --> 01:36:28.388]  Watch my videos.
[01:36:28.969 --> 01:36:31.689]  That could be some helpful points of view.
[01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:33.050]  Alright, man.
[01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:34.130]  Thank you for the call.
[01:36:34.150 --> 01:36:36.751]  Let's jump to Caroline in Florida.
[01:36:36.811 --> 01:36:38.312]  Caroline, what's on your mind?
[01:36:40.133 --> 01:36:40.173]  Hi.
[01:36:40.673 --> 01:36:41.433]  How are you?
[01:36:41.733 --> 01:36:46.915]  I'm calling in about the lady who called in earlier about people going out to bars.
[01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:52.457]  There are different types of bars and it's just like coffee shops, some of them.
[01:36:53.325 --> 01:36:58.676]  There are very nice places, clubs to meet intellectuals and these people.
[01:36:59.687 --> 01:37:01.128]  I don't tend to get drunk.
[01:37:01.188 --> 01:37:02.888]  I've never seen anyone stagger out.
[01:37:02.908 --> 01:37:09.031]  Well I think that her problem is that she's probably like a college girl and you know I see her point.
[01:37:09.071 --> 01:37:13.973]  She's talking about the people that are going out on the weekends and really just trying to get drunk or go to a club.
[01:37:14.233 --> 01:37:18.175]  You know I by no means think that we should just end our social lives whatsoever.
[01:37:18.215 --> 01:37:23.717]  I think that we have to communicate on these in our social lives and like you said you know there are coffee houses out there.
[01:37:24.397 --> 01:37:25.538]  You know there are bars where
[01:37:26.038 --> 01:37:31.499]  You know, people's intentions aren't just to get drunk, they're to sit down and have dinner or a drink with a friend.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:48.124]  I don't think necessarily that we have to, you know, end our social lives, but I see her frustration in that, you know, my generation is very preoccupied with hitting the bar or, you know, going out, oh, let's go do ecstasy and do this, and I think that's more of her point.
[01:37:49.844 --> 01:37:54.626]  A very nice establishment once a week, and I do a big karaoke show.
[01:37:55.758 --> 01:38:09.885]  And a lot of the people there, they do have a lot of topics they talk about in politics, and they actually say that the singing, getting up and singing, is therapeutic for their depression, what's going on today.
[01:38:10.585 --> 01:38:22.951]  And I have seen this place, since I've been working for this particular establishment three years, has tripled in its customers, because they come in, they sing, and then they sit and talk.
[01:38:24.557 --> 01:38:31.759]  And I walk around and get to talk to a lot and hear what they're talking about, and it's all about what's going on in the world.
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:39.362]  So I think it's better that they're there than at home, becoming more and more depressed and afraid.
[01:38:39.793 --> 01:38:41.795]  Well, you know what, I would make this point, too.
[01:38:41.855 --> 01:38:53.725]  If they're just there to try to relieve themselves of some sort of depression, and I thank you for the call, then it really is just like 1984, where the proletariat are the only happy people because they're hitting the bars, and that's not what we need.
[01:38:54.206 --> 01:39:00.491]  Because, alright, you're discussing all these problems, and then you're kind of getting your fix, and you kind of forget about them.
[01:39:00.872 --> 01:39:02.173]  We need people to take action.
[01:39:02.393 --> 01:39:05.155]  Again, there's nothing wrong with going out and getting a drink.
[01:39:06.664 --> 01:39:11.166]  I used to do Tuesday night trivia almost every week on the run up to here.
[01:39:11.206 --> 01:39:22.230]  Tuesday night isn't exactly the night to go out for drinks and I can't say that I was going there to get bombed, but it was nice to hang out with a few of my friends and sit down and get your mind off this stuff.
[01:39:23.567 --> 01:39:25.809]  Test yourself at a little Trivial Pursuit game.
[01:39:25.889 --> 01:39:26.269]  You're right.
[01:39:26.410 --> 01:39:28.251]  It releases the endorphins into the brain.
[01:39:28.932 --> 01:39:31.394]  You forget about things for a while and everything's not so bad.
[01:39:31.674 --> 01:39:37.259]  The problem is that if you do that every night or if that becomes the focus of your life, we're never going to get these problems fixed.
[01:39:37.299 --> 01:39:41.363]  People are never going to turn back to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:39:41.703 --> 01:39:45.767]  People aren't going to understand how this government works and how we can actually
[01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:48.530]  Combat these tyrants!
[01:39:49.330 --> 01:39:50.431]  So I do think that's a problem.
[01:39:50.471 --> 01:39:51.151]  Yeah, it's great.
[01:39:51.191 --> 01:39:52.551]  Everybody's happy and smiling.
[01:39:52.611 --> 01:40:00.033]  Well, uh, you know, the people in Germany were happy and smiling up until the points where, uh, they came and rounded them up.
[01:40:00.553 --> 01:40:07.355]  You know, a lot of them thought, oh, you know, this, this Hitler character, he's getting a little bit out of control, but he'll never, he'll never round us up and put us into camps.
[01:40:07.375 --> 01:40:07.915]  And then he did.
[01:40:08.275 --> 01:40:08.975]  And it was too late.
[01:40:09.895 --> 01:40:12.236]  All right, let's go to Paula in Texas.
[01:40:12.316 --> 01:40:13.096]  Paula, what's on your mind?
[01:40:14.022 --> 01:40:28.505]  Hi, I just wanted to say I agree with what you were talking earlier about Martin Luther King, marching in the streets, the people getting together for a cause and everything, and I think that's a real good thing.
[01:40:28.565 --> 01:40:40.127]  I participated, Kevin Albrecht was here, Tuesday night we had a rally in San Marcos, Texas to reverse the law that they require mandatory microchipping in pets, okay?
[01:40:41.365 --> 01:40:44.026]  Hold it right there for a second, because I just want to point this out.
[01:40:44.366 --> 01:40:54.347]  I was driving down South Lamar yesterday, going to the dentist, and literally on the side of this pet care thing, there was a big sign that said, March Microchip Madness for your pets.
[01:40:54.407 --> 01:40:56.008]  It was March Microchip Madness.
[01:40:56.268 --> 01:41:05.009]  I mean, they are hyping this up, and there was a story in the paper, I think it was off of MSNBC earlier in the week, where a family had their pet chipped.
[01:41:05.329 --> 01:41:09.430]  Now, it was one of the earlier chips, so it didn't have the GPS system in it.
[01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:20.937]  But had their pet chipped, this family lost their dog, had moved three separate times, the dog showed up states over from where they had lost it, and nine years later they got their dog back.
[01:41:21.517 --> 01:41:25.220]  So, oh, isn't that even, your pet gets lost, nine years later you can get it back.
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:30.863]  They make it sound extremely reasonable, but now they want to have it mandatory in your pets.
[01:41:30.903 --> 01:41:31.323]  Continue.
[01:41:31.343 --> 01:41:33.044]  Right.
[01:41:33.184 --> 01:41:34.765]  And I follow those stories too.
[01:41:34.785 --> 01:41:38.888]  When I went to the internet, to YouTube, to look about microchipping your pet,
[01:41:39.301 --> 01:41:42.943]  They had that story that you're talking about right there, and others.
[01:41:43.003 --> 01:41:48.146]  They had somebody who'd lost their cat, and it was returned in six months, and all this kind of stuff.
[01:41:48.566 --> 01:41:53.849]  But the whole thing is, yeah, we have to be aware that they're always going to play to our heart.
[01:41:54.370 --> 01:42:01.414]  And this whole thing is about control, because if they control the pets, they're, by virtue of that, controlling the owners, too.
[01:42:01.954 --> 01:42:03.335]  I mean, but people don't see that.
[01:42:03.455 --> 01:42:08.438]  And also, it is proven that microchips do indeed cause cancer tumors.
[01:42:09.011 --> 01:42:14.914]  Well, I hate to say it, I will do anything I can to help stop the chipping movement because I do believe it's the slippery slope.
[01:42:38.809 --> 01:42:41.051]  I think that they're going to brainwash people.
[01:42:41.872 --> 01:42:43.313]  And they're going to throw down like dogs.
[01:42:43.453 --> 01:42:46.216]  If we get that far, forget about slippery slope.
[01:42:46.256 --> 01:42:48.858]  We've slipped, broke our neck, and we don't have an arm left.
[01:42:49.038 --> 01:42:50.059]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:50.139 --> 01:42:52.081]  I am Jason Bermas, Infowars.com.

[01:43:50.212 --> 01:43:50.972]  It is a big idea.
[01:43:51.072 --> 01:43:51.532]  A new world order.
[01:43:51.712 --> 01:43:53.993]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:44:10.948 --> 01:44:13.090]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:44:13.771 --> 01:44:15.993]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:44:16.573 --> 01:44:19.016]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:44:19.756 --> 01:44:27.063]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:44:30.097 --> 01:44:35.061]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:44:35.541 --> 01:44:38.923]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:44:59.497 --> 01:45:00.018]  I'm warned.

[01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:32.491]  Garden in a can.

[01:45:34.113 --> 01:45:34.413]  Fresh.
[01:45:34.813 --> 01:45:35.194]  Healthy.

[01:46:11.556 --> 01:46:14.138]  So kids, what did we learn today on the Alex Jones Show?
[01:46:14.238 --> 01:46:16.120]  Well, four hours of news.
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:21.464]  We learned that climate change, this crisis can't go to waste, says Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:21.504 --> 01:46:24.847]  We learned that the economy is only going to worsen and continues to worsen.
[01:46:24.907 --> 01:46:27.809]  GM needs 3.5 billion more dollars.
[01:46:27.869 --> 01:46:32.092]  We just lost another 650,000 plus jobs this month.
[01:46:32.152 --> 01:46:33.313]  We know that gold is up.
[01:46:33.754 --> 01:46:34.574]  We know that they're putting
[01:46:35.535 --> 01:46:39.836]  You know, separate types of bird flu in the bird flu vaccinations.
[01:46:40.216 --> 01:46:41.376]  Utterly delicious, you know.
[01:46:41.756 --> 01:46:42.616]  It's just great.
[01:46:43.036 --> 01:46:45.077]  Just great times all around.
[01:46:45.997 --> 01:46:57.759]  And I want to remind everybody, if you like my little sense of humor here or my sarcastic mode, I will be on 9 to 12 midnight tonight and every weeknight, Monday through Friday, The Info Warrior with Jason Burmess.
[01:46:57.779 --> 01:47:00.640]  My blog line will be up by Monday.
[01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:01.960]  I'll be doing two or three stories.
[01:47:02.839 --> 01:47:08.211]  A week from there and of course I'll be sitting in for Alex whenever he needs a break to take some downtime with his family.
[01:47:08.251 --> 01:47:09.794]  Again, there's nothing wrong with a little downtime.
[01:47:11.217 --> 01:47:13.082]  Nothing wrong with a little barski and hutch.
[01:47:13.971 --> 01:47:20.453]  But when you're like, you know what, people are so happy when they come to the bar and they sing and it's just really, it's just so great.
[01:47:20.473 --> 01:47:25.614]  Well, that's not the best thing ever because, yeah, they talk about the issues, but do they do anything about the issues?
[01:47:25.914 --> 01:47:28.275]  It's great to communicate with each other, but how do we take the next step?
[01:47:28.575 --> 01:47:31.656]  You know, first we have to inform one another, then we have to activate.
[01:47:32.236 --> 01:47:34.096]  So we've got a few more callers, let's see who we can get through.
[01:47:34.356 --> 01:47:36.037]  Let's go to Zachary in Hawaii.
[01:47:36.097 --> 01:47:36.937]  Zachary, what's on your mind?
[01:47:39.658 --> 01:47:40.178]  Zachary, with us?
[01:47:42.273 --> 01:47:44.435]  All right, I guess Zach Dropp, let's go to Pam in Wisconsin.
[01:47:44.475 --> 01:47:44.995]  Pam, are you there?
[01:47:45.015 --> 01:47:48.178]  This is Pam Johnson calling.
[01:47:48.198 --> 01:47:48.858]  How are you today?
[01:47:49.199 --> 01:47:49.419]  Good.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:50.900]  Okay.
[01:47:51.580 --> 01:48:00.127]  I've emailed Alex Johnson, corresponded with you, and I've also met with the Secretary of State about to meet with Ron Paul at the Campaign for Liberty Conference at the end of March.
[01:48:01.508 --> 01:48:08.714]  I know all three of you have a message about the fact that Jesus Christ is in the world right now, and he has the cure for AIDS, cancer, hepatitis.
[01:48:09.175 --> 01:48:09.795]  We're good to go.
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.300]  All right, thank you so much, Pam.
[01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:31.161]  Let's jump to Don in Alabama.
[01:48:32.061 --> 01:48:33.541]  I got all these callers.
[01:48:33.561 --> 01:48:34.941]  You're going to plug four websites.
[01:48:35.161 --> 01:48:36.262]  I got the last couple minutes.
[01:48:36.662 --> 01:48:37.502]  Got to go to somebody else.
[01:48:37.522 --> 01:48:39.362]  Let's go to Don in Alabama.
[01:48:39.402 --> 01:48:40.122]  Don, what's on your mind?
[01:48:40.162 --> 01:48:42.003]  I got like 90 seconds for you.
[01:48:42.683 --> 01:48:43.843]  Jason, glad you're back.
[01:48:44.343 --> 01:48:44.803]  Thank you, man.
[01:48:45.323 --> 01:48:49.264]  I'm an old man, so I won't be able to listen to you tonight, but I'll try to get you on podcast.
[01:48:49.624 --> 01:48:50.124]  Sounds good.
[01:48:50.685 --> 01:48:52.765]  Hey, listen, I just want to encourage everybody.
[01:48:52.805 --> 01:48:57.926]  I've been to three places today here in Alabama, and people are ready to listen.
[01:48:58.942 --> 01:49:04.566]  And it was an amazing thing what the conversation was about, mainly about the economy.
[01:49:05.107 --> 01:49:17.336]  But when you step in boldly enough and you start ripping what's really going on, it's amazing how people perk up and come over and start listening and start asking questions.
[01:49:17.997 --> 01:49:24.782]  And then you can point to your Liberty Sources, InfoWars or whatever, where people can get the truth.
[01:49:24.862 --> 01:49:26.964]  But we are being totally lied to.
[01:49:28.018 --> 01:49:29.719]  The fraud is unbelievable.
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:32.621]  We've got a bunch of lying hypocrites.
[01:49:33.562 --> 01:49:40.187]  And if people don't make an effort to step this thing up, we're going to be hurt one way or the other.
[01:49:40.247 --> 01:49:42.068]  But we don't have to be hurt all the way.
[01:49:43.049 --> 01:49:44.550]  We need to step up the game.
[01:49:44.710 --> 01:49:45.931]  We need to tell our neighbors.
[01:49:45.991 --> 01:49:47.232]  We need to tell our friends.
[01:49:47.272 --> 01:49:48.913]  We need to tell our storekeepers.
[01:49:49.594 --> 01:49:50.134]  Everybody.
[01:49:50.334 --> 01:49:52.496]  Policemen, firemen, whoever.
[01:49:53.216 --> 01:49:54.617]  It truly is a red alert.
[01:49:54.917 --> 01:49:56.859]  And folks, it's coming quicker than you think.
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.582]  Don, I love the attitude and I couldn't agree more.
[01:49:59.642 --> 01:50:01.043]  It's time to be human beings again.
[01:50:01.103 --> 01:50:06.767]  It's time to reach out to the ones you care about, the ones you love, your neighbors, your friends, your family.
[01:50:08.028 --> 01:50:09.629]  I mean, if you're not going to tell them, who is?
[01:50:10.632 --> 01:50:12.773]  Yeah, this information's uncomfortable.
[01:50:13.334 --> 01:50:14.254]  It's tough to deal with.
[01:50:14.955 --> 01:50:15.495]  But guess what?
[01:50:15.595 --> 01:50:16.175]  It's real.
[01:50:16.255 --> 01:50:16.936]  It's reality.
[01:50:16.976 --> 01:50:18.097]  It's what's really happening.
[01:50:18.497 --> 01:50:23.240]  So if you want to defend yourself again and you want to save others, you want to save humanity, spread the word.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:25.401]  It's InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:25.441 --> 01:50:26.922]  I'll be back 9 to midnight.
[01:50:27.382 --> 01:50:31.705]  Retransmission begins in 30 seconds only at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:46.943]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:46.983 --> 01:50:49.184]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:51.185 --> 01:50:52.765]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:52.885 --> 01:50:57.468]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:57.628 --> 01:51:00.389]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:00.589 --> 01:51:03.451]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:03.631 --> 01:51:08.353]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:08.573 --> 01:51:09.493]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:09.693 --> 01:51:12.634]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:12.935 --> 01:51:19.837]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:19.937 --> 01:51:23.058]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:23.198 --> 01:51:23.458]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:25.899 --> 01:51:28.343]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:51:28.363 --> 01:51:34.451]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-strided, dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[01:51:38.237 --> 01:51:38.477]  Again, 800...
