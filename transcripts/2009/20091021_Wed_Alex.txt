[00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:06.133]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.895]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:09.656]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:11.237]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:12.158]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:16.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:21.044]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.397 --> 00:00:37.045]  Well, my friends, this is the day that we release Fall of the Republic.
[00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:41.429]  When this radio transmission terminates at 3 p.m.
[00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.073]  Central Standard Time, we will launch
[00:00:46.138 --> 00:00:50.540]  Fall of the Republic, Volume 1, the Presidency of Barack H. Obama.
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:58.784]  I want to thank my entire crew, my entire staff, everyone here in the Good Ship Info Wars for all of their wonderful work.
[00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:02.746]  Without the entire team here, we would not have been able to have done this.
[00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:13.552]  And that counts all the webmasters, the customer service people, the IT folks, the video editors, the people that made the music here in-house, Derek Einkauf,
[00:01:15.106 --> 00:01:18.289]  Will, Craig, and others.
[00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.330]  I'd plug their last names.
[00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.893]  I've never asked if they want to be plugged on air.
[00:01:22.893 --> 00:01:23.813]  I don't think Will does.
[00:01:23.813 --> 00:01:27.456]  But the point is, just a great job by everybody.
[00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:32.040]  We have a very important radio broadcast lined up, obviously, for you today.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.105]  Paul Watson's joining us on the latest flu developments in an hour and a half.
[00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:39.437]  He'll be joining us.
[00:01:39.437 --> 00:01:44.722]  Webster Tarpley will be joining us in the last hour to talk about a host of important issues.
[00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:50.287]  In fact, I have the show prepared in front of me with just extremely important news and information.
[00:01:50.287 --> 00:01:57.214]  But right now, it's hard to focus even in on the release of Follow the Republic and all this news I want to cover.
[00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:09.870]  Because my great uncle, the last living son of Mamaw Jones, I guess her name was Clara Jones, but everybody called her Mamaw.
[00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.771]  She lived to be 103.
[00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:14.772]  She had five sons.
[00:02:14.772 --> 00:02:20.575]  As four of them went to World War II, then the baby was Leonard Jones.
[00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:24.836]  He was the last of five, and she had him many years after she'd had her other sons.
[00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:25.877]  And he was in Korea.
[00:02:27.393 --> 00:02:32.538]  And most of those men died pretty young.
[00:02:32.538 --> 00:02:40.344]  My dad's father died when my father was about 30, when I was five years old.
[00:02:40.344 --> 00:02:54.737]  And so Leonard Jones was a father figure to my dad and to his brother, JoLynn Jones, and was just a really smart, intelligent, very good person, very strong person, very loving person.
[00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:04.866]  He was just a wonderful guy, and he looked more Native American than some of his brothers.
[00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:08.308]  My grandfather, Jerry Jones, looked extremely Native American.
[00:03:08.308 --> 00:03:10.170]  Very handsome men.
[00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:18.414]  And as they got older, they really looked like the classic Native American, stoic, handsome, rugged face.
[00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:22.577]  But even more interesting were those blue eyes staring out of that Indian face.
[00:03:23.854 --> 00:03:31.657]  But he died yesterday afternoon, and my dad didn't call me until this morning to let me know.
[00:03:31.657 --> 00:03:32.997]  No, he died at about 5.30.
[00:03:32.997 --> 00:03:34.838]  My dad learned later in the evening.
[00:03:34.838 --> 00:03:38.039]  He'd been down in Houston quite a bit visiting with him.
[00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:42.461]  And the reason I talk about this is, well, it's multifaceted.
[00:03:44.012 --> 00:03:53.578]  I've been so busy finishing Fall of the Republic and committed to that, and then also finishing up Jesse Ventura's TV show, that I had been meaning to go down to Houston and see him.
[00:03:53.578 --> 00:04:00.262]  You know, the doctor said he might live, or he might live another six months.
[00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:06.026]  He'd supposedly beaten pancreatic cancer a year ago, but the process had really torn him up.
[00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:08.067]  The chemotherapy, the radiation, the rest of it.
[00:04:09.025 --> 00:04:17.331]  But it shows that what I put in to follow the Republic and then I didn't even get to see him before he died.
[00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:20.153]  But about nine months ago he was in Austin.
[00:04:20.153 --> 00:04:21.434]  We had him over for Mexican food.
[00:04:21.434 --> 00:04:31.641]  I went and picked up Mahdi's and he said this is the first time I've been able to really eat a lot in months and gave him some red wine and he ate some beef and chicken fajitas and said it was the best he'd ever had.
[00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:32.561]  Mahdi's does have the best
[00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:35.644]  Best fajitas I've tasted.
[00:04:35.644 --> 00:04:36.785]  But that's another issue.
[00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:44.272]  I had a waking dream last night that I talked to the guys here in the office of whether or not I should share it with people.
[00:04:44.272 --> 00:04:47.054]  And they said, absolutely, everybody's had those experiences.
[00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:48.575]  And I think that's the reason.
[00:04:48.575 --> 00:04:52.759]  I had a dream about his death last night.
[00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.864]  So for all of you out there that don't believe in something after death, you're very, very foolish.
[00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:59.285]  And I don't know what planet you're living on.
[00:05:01.562 --> 00:05:05.566]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.566 --> 00:05:08.809]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:13.613]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:20.019]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:22.262]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.782 --> 00:05:23.082]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:23.082 --> 00:05:23.583]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:24.383]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.383 --> 00:05:25.544]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.544 --> 00:05:27.785]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:46.058]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:05:46.058 --> 00:05:48.961]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:58.091]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:05.790]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.032]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.032 --> 00:06:13.855]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.855 --> 00:06:20.219]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.461]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:24.182]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:24.182 --> 00:06:25.142]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:25.142 --> 00:06:27.224]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:27.224 --> 00:06:28.844]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:28.844 --> 00:06:31.426]  And right now in Washington D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.176 --> 00:07:00.539]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:01.439]  You worry.
[00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:03.500]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.141]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:08.261]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.862]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:13.463]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:07:13.463 --> 00:07:18.304]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:07:18.703 --> 00:07:22.675]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:23.959]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:27.271]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:07:27.271 --> 00:07:30.714]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:07:30.714 --> 00:07:39.360]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.184]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[00:07:44.184 --> 00:07:48.207]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[00:07:57.424 --> 00:08:02.993]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:08:02.993 --> 00:08:05.778]  Presents the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:08.061]  Because there's a war on for your mind!
[00:08:15.513 --> 00:08:17.354]  Hello, my friends.
[00:08:17.354 --> 00:08:26.980]  It is October 21st, 2009, the date that we are releasing Fall of the Republic, Volume 1, the presidency of Barack H. Obama.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:42.048]  I cannot express to you in words how important it is that this film go mega-viral across the internet, and that all of you that get the DVD at InfoWars.com get a DVD burner and make as many copies as you can.
[00:08:42.048 --> 00:08:44.450]  There can no longer be any more denial.
[00:08:46.169 --> 00:09:08.335]  We had the documents decades ago, how the central banks planned to bankrupt the planet, to make every nation on earth dependent to them, how they were going to bring in a world government that would finance itself through money transfer taxes like the Tobin tax, and of course the global carbon tax, meant to regulate and micromanage every facet of our lives under a web of bureaucratic red tape.
[00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.971]  My friends, they're now openly announcing world government.
[00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.652]  And it's exactly what was in all their battle plans years ago.
[00:09:18.652 --> 00:09:20.252]  But it's even worse.
[00:09:20.252 --> 00:09:22.493]  This is a 21st century nightmare.
[00:09:22.493 --> 00:09:31.534]  They're about to ratify the Copenhagen Global Tax on all forms of industry and human activity planet wide.
[00:09:31.534 --> 00:09:34.075]  They're openly admitting it's a world government.
[00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:43.609]  That is one of the key subjects that we cover in Follow the Republic, in their own words, their own documents, their own video statements.
[00:09:43.609 --> 00:09:45.352]  And we have the solutions.
[00:09:46.499 --> 00:09:48.781]  To counter these people and bring them to justice.
[00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:54.046]  We also identify the banking cartel that empowers this entire global Ponzi scheme.
[00:09:54.046 --> 00:09:56.889]  That's all the New World Order is.
[00:09:56.889 --> 00:10:08.360]  Is a group of made-off slash Ken Lay types that have gotten control of the issuance of currency and credit and have created tens of trillions of dollars backed up by taxpayers.
[00:10:09.488 --> 00:10:13.992]  That they're able to pay off and buy off the entire planet with.
[00:10:13.992 --> 00:10:15.854]  They've stolen tens of trillions of dollars.
[00:10:15.854 --> 00:10:17.655]  They won't say where it's gone.
[00:10:17.655 --> 00:10:28.185]  Either we identify these criminals, wake the population up to them, and bring them to justice through the grand juries with criminal charges, as Congressman Ron Paul and others have called for.
[00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:30.106]  They've clearly committed crimes.
[00:10:30.106 --> 00:10:32.428]  Insider trading, conflicts of interest,
[00:10:33.254 --> 00:10:38.059]  With Treasury Department officials and the private Federal Reserve, it's all in Fall of the Republic.
[00:10:38.059 --> 00:10:40.301]  The experts we've got in this film.
[00:10:40.301 --> 00:10:42.003]  G. Edward Griffin.
[00:10:42.003 --> 00:10:43.124]  Economist.
[00:10:43.124 --> 00:10:44.645]  Webster Tarpley.
[00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:46.007]  Max Keiser.
[00:10:46.007 --> 00:10:46.948]  So many others.
[00:10:46.948 --> 00:10:49.770]  Go to InfoWars.com, read the rundown on the film.
[00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.032]  George Humphrey.
[00:10:51.032 --> 00:10:54.095]  The list goes on and on and on.
[00:10:54.095 --> 00:10:54.775]  Alan Watt.
[00:10:55.456 --> 00:11:01.377]  Myself and many others, but most importantly, the statements of the globalists themselves.
[00:11:01.377 --> 00:11:05.759]  My friends, the Obama deception has been out for over six months.
[00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:14.101]  It is still the number one film online, the number one documentary online on Google and YouTube and all the other major video channels.
[00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:16.041]  And that happened because of you.
[00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:18.922]  More and more when I do syndicated radio interviews on other people's shows,
[00:11:19.642 --> 00:11:20.203]  We're good to go.
[00:11:41.005 --> 00:11:48.389]  And many others, psychology today, have singled me out and said that I'm this great threat to their new world order.
[00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:50.230]  They have admitted that we're having an effect.
[00:11:50.230 --> 00:12:00.956]  They've admitted that we're actually affecting change and making people focus in on real issues, not the left-right puppets that they put up in front of us to distract us.
[00:12:01.803 --> 00:12:05.545]  But all the credit for that goes to you.
[00:12:05.545 --> 00:12:16.310]  My radio audience is the most responsive, the most active, wonderful activists who are standing up against the New World Order, standing up against collectivism, standing up against corruption.
[00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.911]  And you are concerning the establishment.
[00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:27.255]  Congress has had different commissions that have issued reports saying that they are extremely threatened by the alternative media in the United States and worldwide.
[00:12:27.615 --> 00:12:38.814]  And make no mistake, my documentary films, my radio show, our news websites, and you, our secret weapon, our listeners, are at the tip of the spear of the alternative media.
[00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:45.324]  Ladies and gentlemen, you made the Obama deception in Endgame and Terror Storm massive successes.
[00:12:45.324 --> 00:12:49.486]  Each time we reach more people, we are frightening the establishment.
[00:12:49.486 --> 00:12:51.426]  They have identified us as enemies.
[00:12:51.426 --> 00:12:54.648]  They have identified that we're endangering their entire program.
[00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:57.189]  They know that we have a fighting chance to beat them.
[00:12:57.189 --> 00:13:01.891]  This will succeed if you unleash yourself and take action.
[00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:05.413]  Show Fall of the Republic to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[00:13:05.413 --> 00:13:07.414]  Give it to your entire community.
[00:13:07.414 --> 00:13:08.755]  It is up to you.
[00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:15.863]  Because in the final equation, we are at the crossroads as a society right now.
[00:13:15.863 --> 00:13:17.805]  There's no longer any doubt.
[00:13:17.805 --> 00:13:18.947]  We were right.
[00:13:18.947 --> 00:13:20.348]  It is world government.
[00:13:20.348 --> 00:13:22.311]  It is a global carbon tax.
[00:13:22.311 --> 00:13:23.612]  It is tyranny.
[00:13:23.612 --> 00:13:25.975]  It will micromanage every facet of our lives.
[00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:31.300]  But the good news is the establishment is failing on many fronts.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:41.548]  But where they're succeeding, they're doing it by the thinnest of margins and enraging the world population when they go against the will of the people and when they go against justice.
[00:13:42.557 --> 00:13:48.939]  And so we can certainly affect change right now because the establishment is stumbling and falling and faltering.
[00:13:48.939 --> 00:14:03.843]  But they are still an extremely powerful and dangerous foe because they control the mainstream corporate media and they control the purse strings with the endless trillions they can issue of fiat liquidity and loans into the market.
[00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.584]  Fall of the Republic details it all.
[00:14:06.584 --> 00:14:10.085]  It is a quantum leap from previous films I have made.
[00:14:10.965 --> 00:14:17.010]  And I am so proud of the work myself and my team have put together in this film.
[00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.973]  And I'm asking you to be part of saving our Republic.
[00:14:20.973 --> 00:14:25.097]  We are at that crossroads, but the enemy has shown themselves.
[00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:29.280]  They have admitted that they want a planetary government run by a private bank.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.203]  They have admitted they're setting up domestic spy forces.
[00:14:32.203 --> 00:14:38.688]  They have admitted that Homeland Security and NORTHCOM are for the American people to suppress libertarians, conservatives,
[00:14:39.008 --> 00:14:44.534]  Liberals, anti-war activists, anyone who stands against their tyranny.
[00:14:44.534 --> 00:14:52.723]  They have shown themselves as the tyrants and the traitors and the larcenous criminals that they are.
[00:14:52.723 --> 00:14:58.449]  Vol Republic identifies the enemies of our nation and the enemies of free humanity worldwide.
[00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:06.712]  That's the first step and it gives you the solutions that we need to take our planet back from these criminals.
[00:15:06.712 --> 00:15:16.716]  I am begging you to realize that you must stand up at this critical juncture in history and get involved and speak out and spread the Obama deception.
[00:15:17.589 --> 00:15:24.057]  Endgame, Terror Storm, all of my films, The Four Winds, but most importantly, Fall of the Republic.
[00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:31.426]  You can download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, get the DVDs at InfoWars.com.
[00:15:31.426 --> 00:15:33.328]  It is up to you out there.
[00:15:33.328 --> 00:15:35.731]  I want to commend the activists for what they've done in the past.
[00:15:36.011 --> 00:15:39.475]  For their love and passion for truth and decency and honor.
[00:15:39.475 --> 00:15:42.799]  And I want to ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:44.601]  We're not going down without a fight.
[00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:47.285]  We're not gonna die on our knees in some ditch.
[00:15:47.285 --> 00:15:50.649]  We're gonna stand up on our hind legs and fight this tyranny.
[00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:52.149]  It's up to you.
[00:15:52.149 --> 00:15:54.210]  The Republic is falling.
[00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.291]  We're not waiting for the New World Order now.
[00:15:56.291 --> 00:15:58.052]  We're in the New World Order.
[00:15:58.052 --> 00:15:59.252]  It is unfolding.
[00:15:59.252 --> 00:16:01.973]  And so people, they're finally waking up and listening.
[00:16:01.973 --> 00:16:03.354]  This is the time.
[00:16:03.354 --> 00:16:05.275]  History is being made right now.
[00:16:05.275 --> 00:16:08.196]  Will the forces of corruption and darkness succeed?
[00:16:08.196 --> 00:16:18.340]  Or will all those that love liberty and freedom stand up and set bushfires in the minds of men and women everywhere and take our civilization back?
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.080]  Make no mistake.
[00:16:20.287 --> 00:16:24.249]  The future destiny of humanity is in our hands.
[00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.770]  Take your destiny.
[00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:30.012]  This is your time to be part of history on the side of good.
[00:16:30.012 --> 00:16:31.453]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:16:31.453 --> 00:16:34.014]  Get it out there like your life depends on it.
[00:16:34.014 --> 00:16:37.276]  Because our life and our liberty surely does.
[00:16:37.276 --> 00:16:40.097]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:16:40.097 --> 00:16:41.598]  Volume 1.
[00:16:41.598 --> 00:16:43.119]  Presidency of Barack Obama.
[00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:51.218]  Available on DVD at InfoWars.com and online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:16:51.218 --> 00:16:55.263]  The destiny of humanity is in our hands.
[00:16:55.263 --> 00:16:55.704]  October 21st, 2009.
[00:17:00.765 --> 00:17:02.706]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
[00:17:02.706 --> 00:17:11.030]  That is the audio from a video that just now premiered up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:19.715]  The video is titled, Alex Jones asks supporters to redouble their efforts in stopping the fall of the Republic.
[00:17:19.715 --> 00:17:29.520]  We can't save the Republic if we don't recognize just how dire the situation is, just how much trouble our society and civilization is in.
[00:17:30.658 --> 00:17:42.884]  Okay, in the next segment, I am going to talk about my great-uncle who died yesterday evening in Houston, Texas.
[00:17:42.884 --> 00:17:50.948]  And some people might be saying, well, we have a lot of news and information we want to know about, Alex, and why should we be concerned about the death of your great-uncle?
[00:17:51.957 --> 00:18:11.567]  Well, because life and death affects us all and there's some interesting parables and some very, very revealing information in association with it that I know will touch all of you out there because almost anyone I talk to has had similar experiences.
[00:18:11.567 --> 00:18:14.589]  You really have to wonder about people who say that they haven't.
[00:18:15.814 --> 00:18:20.758]  Because for all of us that have had these experiences, we know how real they are.
[00:18:20.758 --> 00:18:26.922]  And we've had a glimpse through to the other side, to another dimension.
[00:18:26.922 --> 00:18:32.086]  And so I will discuss that when we come back from break.
[00:18:32.086 --> 00:18:41.193]  Also, Roll Call, one of the big Washington papers, the main paper of Congress, reports that Alexander
[00:18:43.139 --> 00:19:01.729]  To suggest that Obama White House is plotting a political strategy similar to that of ex-president Richard Nixon and maybe on the verge of preparing its own enemies list.
[00:19:01.729 --> 00:19:02.990]  This wasn't just in
[00:19:04.926 --> 00:19:10.209]  The big tabloid a few weeks ago listing myself, Alex Jones, as one of the top enemies.
[00:19:10.209 --> 00:19:15.032]  Obama's secret enemies list revealed 25 names who president wants to silence and why.
[00:19:15.032 --> 00:19:20.315]  There have been mainstream reports admitting Obama does have an enemies list and is going after people.
[00:19:20.315 --> 00:19:25.318]  But I don't need to read this in the newspaper to know there's an enemies list.
[00:19:25.318 --> 00:19:30.701]  In the last four months or so, there have been concerted attacks on myself.
[00:19:31.886 --> 00:19:39.412]  We've always been under attack, but this is concerted and focused and I'm not complaining or whining.
[00:19:39.412 --> 00:19:41.513]  This is what I asked for.
[00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:44.235]  And I know that stepping up against these people, they're going to engage us.
[00:19:44.235 --> 00:19:45.916]  They're going to respond.
[00:19:45.916 --> 00:19:53.302]  But it's just more of a confirmation of the type of serious tyranny we're facing as a society and just how criminal these individuals are.
[00:19:53.302 --> 00:19:55.764]  So we'll be covering that, the latest flu information.
[00:19:55.764 --> 00:19:58.586]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us as well as Webster Tarpey today.
[00:19:58.586 --> 00:19:59.927]  Very important broadcast lined up.

[00:21:00.717 --> 00:21:02.899]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.899 --> 00:21:03.739]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.739 --> 00:21:04.079]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:09.123]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.123 --> 00:21:10.744]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.744 --> 00:21:11.484]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.484 --> 00:21:11.905]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.905 --> 00:21:13.005]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:15.967]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.967 --> 00:21:19.850]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.712]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.972 --> 00:21:25.593]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.593 --> 00:21:27.173]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.173 --> 00:21:27.473]  Right!

[00:21:31.354 --> 00:21:32.714]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.714 --> 00:21:36.575]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.

[00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:02.236]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:02.236 --> 00:22:07.760]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.301]  I get it.
[00:22:08.301 --> 00:22:17.928]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:17.928 --> 00:22:19.089]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:19.329 --> 00:22:27.796]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:27.796 --> 00:22:31.199]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:31.199 --> 00:22:35.462]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:35.462 --> 00:22:37.064]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:37.064 --> 00:22:41.027]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:44.630]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:45.731]  You should too.
[00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:46.873]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:46.873 --> 00:22:50.258]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[00:22:50.518 --> 00:22:50.598]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.598 --> 00:22:50.778]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.655 --> 00:23:07.382]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[00:23:07.382 --> 00:23:09.044]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[00:23:09.044 --> 00:23:13.628]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[00:23:13.628 --> 00:23:21.316]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:23.779]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[00:23:23.939 --> 00:23:26.160]  And has no dangerous second-hand smoke.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.102]  So it's safe for the people around you.
[00:23:28.102 --> 00:23:32.424]  And will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.

[00:24:18.985 --> 00:24:21.206]  What is it to be human?
[00:24:21.206 --> 00:24:24.668]  What is it to live on this planet?
[00:24:24.668 --> 00:24:26.128]  Spinning through
[00:24:49.093 --> 00:24:54.735]  The deepness of eternity and space and time.
[00:24:54.735 --> 00:25:06.798]  We've all had experiences where we're walking along in the woods in a national park or on your own property and you feel someone's eyes upon you.
[00:25:06.798 --> 00:25:09.979]  You turn towards the direction they're looking at you from.
[00:25:09.979 --> 00:25:17.782]  You walk through the woods a hundred yards and you look up in a deer stand in the spring
[00:25:19.505 --> 00:25:27.887]  And someone is hunting out of season across the fence line on their own property.
[00:25:27.887 --> 00:25:32.329]  You wave at them and continue walking on through the woods.
[00:25:32.329 --> 00:25:38.410]  That happened once when I was squirrel hunting.
[00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:43.012]  But it's happened in different ways to everybody out there, at least everybody I've ever talked to.
[00:25:43.012 --> 00:25:43.572]  What is that?
[00:25:45.609 --> 00:26:14.145]  There are confirmed university reports, especially out of Australia, where they've studied it the last 40 years or so, and the studies I've seen, where they'll have an opal mine or a diamond mine in Australia, and one of the aborigines will walk out of the mine and say, you gotta put me on a plane, gotta put me on a helicopter, my mother just died, or my father's dying, and they're never wrong.
[00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:19.253]  They'll come out of the mine and say, my brother just got hurt really bad.
[00:26:19.253 --> 00:26:27.717]  They put him on the plane, they fly him 1,000 miles away, and it's never a false alarm.
[00:26:27.717 --> 00:26:38.863]  They know when one of those aborigines walks out of the mine, very hard workers, and says, I've gotta go, that they gotta go.
[00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:41.424]  And they don't get in trouble for it.
[00:26:45.405 --> 00:26:48.927]  I've had waking dreams many times in my life.
[00:26:48.927 --> 00:26:51.247]  I have them a few times a year and they're different.
[00:26:51.247 --> 00:26:52.328]  You know they're important.
[00:26:52.328 --> 00:26:56.009]  You know as if you've been somewhere else.
[00:26:56.009 --> 00:26:56.950]  You are braced.
[00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.891]  You are shocked by it.
[00:26:59.891 --> 00:27:11.856]  And one time I had a dream that I even told people about where I walked around this cinder block building and someone in a pink and green and purple striped polo shirt began assaulting me.
[00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:31.346]  Months later, as I walked around a cinder block building, I had a sick feeling of deja vu and there was the person in the polo shirt and they assaulted me.
[00:27:31.346 --> 00:27:36.351]  I will tell you that I didn't just see the news and the reports and the preparation.
[00:27:36.351 --> 00:27:38.994]  Similar things, I'll just share this with you, happened before 9-11.
[00:27:42.005 --> 00:27:49.187]  To the point of, I said they're going to probably blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on Bin Laden.
[00:27:49.187 --> 00:27:59.589]  And it is a side of me that I don't really share on air, because I know that detractors will try to spin it against me, but I really don't care at this point.
[00:27:59.589 --> 00:28:01.269]  The truth is the truth.
[00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:08.571]  And the point is, anyone who's in tune with the universe, the spirit of the universe that
[00:28:10.658 --> 00:28:19.602]  Einstein talked about how justice bends towards, is attracted.
[00:28:19.602 --> 00:28:24.844]  The universe bends towards justice.
[00:28:24.844 --> 00:28:35.808]  And I remember my father's mother, my grandmother, Patti Jones, she had been sick for several years.
[00:28:36.857 --> 00:28:39.179]  But was getting up and walking around and was fine.
[00:28:39.179 --> 00:28:42.121]  And no one expected her to die.
[00:28:42.121 --> 00:28:46.023]  And I called my dad one night.
[00:28:46.023 --> 00:28:52.048]  I guess this is about five and a half years ago now, how time moves quickly, how it flies.
[00:28:52.048 --> 00:28:54.829]  And I said, we've got to go see Meemaw.
[00:28:54.829 --> 00:28:56.170]  That's what I called her.
[00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.232]  We've got to go see her tomorrow.
[00:28:58.232 --> 00:29:01.674]  And I hadn't seen her in months.
[00:29:01.674 --> 00:29:03.956]  I said, I've just really got a feeling we've got to go see her.
[00:29:03.956 --> 00:29:04.937]  And I said, is she okay?
[00:29:05.922 --> 00:29:09.064]  He said, yeah, you know, she's, she's sick.
[00:29:09.064 --> 00:29:09.784]  She always is.
[00:29:09.784 --> 00:29:11.265]  But yeah, he said, I agree.
[00:29:11.265 --> 00:29:12.325]  I've been thinking we need to go see her.
[00:29:12.325 --> 00:29:19.589]  And he was seeing her every few weeks, you know, driving the 200 miles to go see her from Austin to East Texas at the time.
[00:29:19.589 --> 00:29:27.053]  And that morning he showed up at my house at about seven 30 and I had been doing a late night radio interview until two, three in the morning.
[00:29:27.053 --> 00:29:29.315]  And he just said, Oh, wake him up in a couple hours.
[00:29:29.315 --> 00:29:30.375]  He can drive himself.
[00:29:30.375 --> 00:29:33.117]  I'll meet him there.
[00:29:33.117 --> 00:29:33.437]  And then
[00:29:35.823 --> 00:29:46.151]  30 minutes away from her house, my uncle called him and said that she had just died.
[00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:50.274]  Now I'll get into my uncle, my great uncle dying yesterday when we come back.
[00:29:50.274 --> 00:29:51.115]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.115 --> 00:29:55.038]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.038 --> 00:29:57.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.933 --> 00:30:03.935]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:09.260]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.321]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:16.325]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.325 --> 00:30:17.226]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.486 --> 00:30:18.607]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.607 --> 00:30:20.489]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.489 --> 00:30:21.569]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:23.771]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:25.112]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.112 --> 00:30:26.634]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.634 --> 00:30:31.918]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.918 --> 00:30:35.501]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:38.964]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:40.525]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.525 --> 00:30:41.446]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.446 --> 00:30:42.546]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.546 --> 00:30:43.467]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.467 --> 00:30:44.568]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.568 --> 00:30:47.610]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.391]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.391 --> 00:30:50.312]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.801 --> 00:31:05.811]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:05.811 --> 00:31:09.059]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.059 --> 00:31:10.483]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:31:11.195 --> 00:31:13.857]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:13.857 --> 00:31:20.240]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.783]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:25.783 --> 00:31:35.429]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.529 --> 00:31:37.890]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.471]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.471 --> 00:31:41.932]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:41.932 --> 00:31:44.054]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.054 --> 00:31:49.196]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.196 --> 00:31:58.561]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:00.407 --> 00:32:01.708]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:01.708 --> 00:32:07.292]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:12.315]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:32:12.315 --> 00:32:17.879]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:32:17.879 --> 00:32:22.582]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:30.223]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:32:30.223 --> 00:32:31.323]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:31.323 --> 00:32:38.026]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:32:38.026 --> 00:32:41.207]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:41.207 --> 00:32:43.428]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:44.388]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:44.388 --> 00:32:44.588]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:53.148 --> 00:32:57.070]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:01.032]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseabank.com.
[00:33:01.032 --> 00:33:11.757]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[00:33:11.757 --> 00:33:14.979]  Use it only in emergency.
[00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:33.067]  Well, you should pray to God, the Father and the Spirit will guide you and protect you from up here.
[00:33:33.067 --> 00:33:36.689]  Can you hear me?
[00:33:36.689 --> 00:33:40.391]  Can you hear me running?
[00:33:40.391 --> 00:33:42.031]  Can you hear me running?
[00:33:42.031 --> 00:33:44.833]  Can you hear me calling you?
[00:33:53.547 --> 00:34:21.131]  What I'm discussing today deals with the very nature of reality and our limited five senses and that sixth sense and the proofs of the fact that there is more in this universe than meets the eye or the taste or the touch or what we hear or even feel.
[00:34:24.292 --> 00:34:52.023]  So, Leonard Jones, the youngest of five brothers, to my father's great-grandmother, Mamaw Jones, as she was known, she lived to be 103, but the first four of her five sons died, they were all World War II veterans, died before she died, and she said the only thing she regretted in her wonderful life, I remember talking to her when I was little bitty,
[00:34:53.666 --> 00:35:01.588]  Was that she had outlived four of her five sons, but she did die before her fifth son, Leonard Jones, passed.
[00:35:01.588 --> 00:35:07.790]  And he himself was a veteran of Korea.
[00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:17.453]  And a... Oh, he'd worked his way up from a roughneck in the oil fields to a plant manager, one of the biggest in Houston.
[00:35:17.453 --> 00:35:18.353]  Just a great guy.
[00:35:18.353 --> 00:35:20.954]  I remember deer hunting with him from the time I was five years old.
[00:35:22.731 --> 00:35:30.075]  And he really was the last of that generation for my father, David Jones, and his brother, Joe Jones.
[00:35:30.075 --> 00:35:33.696]  And I know that my father just loved him limitlessly.
[00:35:33.696 --> 00:35:35.938]  But my dad's at work today, though he's very sad.
[00:35:35.938 --> 00:35:38.219]  I talked to him this morning.
[00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:42.161]  And I'm talking about a death in our family because this affects everyone.
[00:35:42.161 --> 00:35:45.422]  When you lose someone, it affects all of us.
[00:35:45.422 --> 00:35:46.723]  We're all interconnected.
[00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:52.271]  But the issue is he died at about 5.30 yesterday.
[00:35:52.271 --> 00:35:59.115]  My dad learned later in the evening and didn't call me until this morning.
[00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:03.657]  And I had one of those waking dreams last night, but this one was different than one I've ever had.
[00:36:03.657 --> 00:36:12.903]  But I woke up in the middle of the night upset by it, knowing that it was an omen or that it foretold something.
[00:36:12.903 --> 00:36:14.684]  And I had trouble going back to sleep.
[00:36:14.684 --> 00:36:16.224]  I got up and walked around the house some.
[00:36:17.287 --> 00:36:34.814]  Went in and looked at my children in their beds, got a glass of water, went back to bed, and then had another waking dream that made no sense.
[00:36:34.814 --> 00:36:38.196]  Until I woke up this morning and found out that my uncle had died.
[00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:41.217]  Here's the first dream.
[00:36:41.217 --> 00:36:46.199]  I'm looking into a science fiction-esque white-walled
[00:36:51.363 --> 00:37:08.311]  Cylindrical room and through a crack in the ceiling, a arm, first fingers in an arm slide through and it chilled me to my bone.
[00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:10.191]  It was destiny.
[00:37:10.191 --> 00:37:11.252]  It was a bridge.
[00:37:11.252 --> 00:37:17.034]  It was a road, a path we're all on that we will all experience.
[00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:18.315]  It is the great equalizer.
[00:37:20.652 --> 00:37:33.036]  Of kings and paupers, of warriors and priests, of mothers and fathers, and everyone that has ever lived, and everyone that has ever died.
[00:37:33.036 --> 00:37:43.059]  I knew that arm as it appeared, coming down out of the ceiling, for what it was, the arm of death, the Grim Reaper.
[00:37:43.059 --> 00:37:46.500]  And it chills me to my bone right now to see that arm.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.861]  It wasn't muscular, but it had immense strength.
[00:37:49.707 --> 00:38:15.105]  It was slender, its fingers were long and suddenly in the side of the wall appeared a type of vault or safe door and the fingers began to work numbers that appeared on its face in a hieroglyphic symbol and the door opened and it reached in and then suddenly I was looking out a doorway into space and
[00:38:16.235 --> 00:38:23.658]  An old man with gray hair was stepping through the gate, and I awoke.
[00:38:23.658 --> 00:38:27.660]  I had been to a place far away.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:34.763]  I had stared into another dimension.
[00:38:34.763 --> 00:38:41.246]  I got up, shook myself, went back to sleep,
[00:38:42.162 --> 00:39:03.910]  And then I was transported to a warm, dark house on one of my family's ancestral home places in East Texas, and it was dark and there were men in the room.
[00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.071]  And my father's brother,
[00:39:06.072 --> 00:39:11.093]  And I need to call him, and if anybody's hearing this now that knows him, don't tell him about this until I've talked to him.
[00:39:11.093 --> 00:39:15.894]  I need to call him today, because I am assured that he was there and that he had this dream.
[00:39:15.894 --> 00:39:17.595]  I haven't called him yet.
[00:39:17.595 --> 00:39:20.255]  I only decided to talk about this right before I went on air.
[00:39:20.255 --> 00:39:26.056]  And there were other men, and I could tell they were family, living people.
[00:39:26.056 --> 00:39:32.758]  And he was saying, it's okay, I saw the same thing you saw, and he's in a better place now.
[00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:40.476]  And then his son was there saying, is it okay?
[00:39:40.476 --> 00:39:41.657]  My cousin was there.
[00:39:41.657 --> 00:39:43.879]  I guess he's about 12 years old, 11 years old.
[00:39:43.879 --> 00:39:45.060]  I forget now.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:49.344]  James was there and he was saying to his dad, is it okay?
[00:39:49.344 --> 00:39:57.371]  And my uncle was almost childlike babbling happily saying, yes, yes, it's okay.
[00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:10.735]  And I go back to calling my father on a Friday night and saying, we've got to go see my grandmother tomorrow.
[00:40:10.735 --> 00:40:11.896]  We've got to go see her.
[00:40:11.896 --> 00:40:12.896]  We've got to go see her.
[00:40:12.896 --> 00:40:13.857]  I haven't been there in months.
[00:40:13.857 --> 00:40:14.738]  I want to go see her.
[00:40:14.738 --> 00:40:16.179]  Is she okay?
[00:40:16.179 --> 00:40:17.440]  Is she taking a turn for the worse?
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.681]  And he said, no, she's fine.
[00:40:19.681 --> 00:40:26.025]  And then that next morning, she took a, on that Saturday morning, a really bad turn.
[00:40:26.025 --> 00:40:32.570]  She was in the bed and the local Baptist pastor who down the street that my dad went to high school with,
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.903]  It wasn't even from her church, the Methodist church in town, the little country church.
[00:40:39.903 --> 00:40:44.787]  He came down and he told her, it's okay, Patty, you can turn loose.
[00:40:44.787 --> 00:40:48.931]  Again, you know how women especially wait to die till their loved ones are there.
[00:40:48.931 --> 00:40:51.212]  It's okay, you can turn loose.
[00:40:51.212 --> 00:40:56.136]  And then she, she died.
[00:40:56.136 --> 00:40:58.418]  And she, she wasn't even really struggling.
[00:40:58.418 --> 00:40:59.519]  He just said, you can turn loose.
[00:40:59.519 --> 00:41:03.042]  And she said, okay, took a deep breath and died, gave up the ghost.
[00:41:04.872 --> 00:41:08.834]  It's amazing how human beings, in many cases, can control when they die.
[00:41:08.834 --> 00:41:10.255]  They can hold on.
[00:41:10.255 --> 00:41:12.416]  It's the spirit.
[00:41:12.416 --> 00:41:21.440]  And so, as I said, my father showed up at my house at 7.30.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.261]  My wife came in, tried to get me up.
[00:41:23.261 --> 00:41:25.963]  I'd gone ahead and done some radio interview until 2, 3 in the morning.
[00:41:27.711 --> 00:41:30.033]  I smelled coffee downstairs.
[00:41:30.033 --> 00:41:31.014]  She said, your dad's here.
[00:41:31.014 --> 00:41:32.294]  And I just said, Oh, tell him to wait.
[00:41:32.294 --> 00:41:33.535]  Tell him he waited like 30 minutes.
[00:41:33.535 --> 00:41:35.057]  I wouldn't get up back then.
[00:41:35.057 --> 00:41:37.799]  I was, wasn't as disciplined as I am now.
[00:41:37.799 --> 00:41:38.479]  Five years ago.
[00:41:38.479 --> 00:41:44.243]  Now I've just trained myself to get up, but I wanted to sleep some more because I've been up till late at night.
[00:41:44.243 --> 00:41:46.165]  And then when I got up, she said, Oh, he left.
[00:41:46.165 --> 00:41:47.706]  He said, get in your car and follow him.
[00:41:47.706 --> 00:41:54.171]  So I got in my car and I'd gotten to about Round Rock where you get ready to make the turn to drive to
[00:41:55.742 --> 00:41:58.843]  Where my family's from in East Texas on my dad's side.
[00:41:58.843 --> 00:42:03.504]  And my cell phone rang and he was about 30 minutes away by then from there.
[00:42:03.504 --> 00:42:08.026]  He was about an hour and a half ahead of me, two hours ahead of me.
[00:42:08.026 --> 00:42:11.447]  And he said, she, she, she just died.
[00:42:11.447 --> 00:42:12.087]  She just died.
[00:42:16.243 --> 00:42:31.214]  So there's that other experience, and I knew in the last few weeks, and I was so busy with the film, so busy having to, if Ventura hadn't called and said, we need you to come do one more shoot, I was planning to go then, that weekend, but then I got behind, I wanted to see my children, I was like, well how is Uncle Leonard?
[00:42:31.214 --> 00:42:42.062]  Well, you know, who knows, he may live another year, he may live a month, but he doesn't want to take any more medications or see the doctors, he doesn't even watch TV now, he just sits there and basically meditates on life and says he's ready to go.
[00:42:43.055 --> 00:42:46.816]  And he wish it was otherwise, but he is, but you've got time.
[00:42:46.816 --> 00:42:49.917]  We're planning to go down there next week.
[00:42:49.917 --> 00:43:02.141]  I was going to take off Thursday and Friday and take my children because my son has met Uncle Leonard quite a bit and loves him and particularly wanted to see him and was very upset wanting to see him in the last couple weeks.
[00:43:02.141 --> 00:43:03.181]  My son isn't that type.
[00:43:03.181 --> 00:43:04.221]  He isn't into hysterics.
[00:43:04.221 --> 00:43:05.381]  He was saying, I really want to go see Uncle Leonard.
[00:43:05.381 --> 00:43:08.302]  I want to go see Uncle Leonard before he dies.
[00:43:08.302 --> 00:43:09.463]  My son doesn't even really know yet.
[00:43:09.463 --> 00:43:10.403]  We didn't tell him this morning.
[00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:22.988]  And you better talk to people you love.
[00:43:22.988 --> 00:43:24.689]  You better let them know you love them.
[00:43:24.689 --> 00:43:30.970]  If you've got a feeling you need to see somebody or you need to warn somebody or you need to spend time with somebody, you better just drop what you're doing and do it.
[00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:38.552]  I should have left that Friday night and gone to see my grandmother and been there when she died.
[00:43:38.552 --> 00:43:42.653]  I was there when my grandfather died and it was a very important experience in my life spiritually.
[00:43:44.409 --> 00:43:48.592]  And I was there when one of my friends died a few years ago.
[00:43:48.592 --> 00:43:52.815]  Went into the hospital for a minor procedure, got an infection and it killed him two days later.
[00:43:52.815 --> 00:43:54.776]  Total organ failure.
[00:43:54.776 --> 00:43:56.998]  And you'd think that you wouldn't want to be around when somebody dies.
[00:43:56.998 --> 00:44:07.145]  The establishment wants us to just shelve old people, shelve sick people, ignore it like you're throwing a Happy Meal bag in the trash in this instant gratification society.
[00:44:07.145 --> 00:44:13.390]  But it's important that you be there if you can when people pass over to the other side.
[00:44:14.554 --> 00:44:22.681]  And the larger issue, obviously, in all of this is, there is more to the universe than meets the eye.
[00:44:22.681 --> 00:44:40.195]  And Daryl Rundis, who we've had on the air, who's a lay pastor, he's made the point and the analogy to people that will sell their soul for wealth and power and status, who will ignore their conscience, who will harden their heart, who will commit to evil, who will commit to selfishness.
[00:44:42.841 --> 00:44:45.564]  And none of us are perfect, but it's the act of not caring.
[00:44:45.564 --> 00:44:47.986]  That's the real sin.
[00:44:47.986 --> 00:44:53.611]  King David had one of his best friends killed, sent him off on a mission.
[00:44:53.611 --> 00:44:58.176]  He knew he was sure to die just so he could have his woman, but he repented.
[00:44:58.176 --> 00:45:03.141]  And so God said, you are a man after my own heart.
[00:45:03.141 --> 00:45:06.604]  The issue here is, is what your heart has written on it.
[00:45:15.694 --> 00:45:20.618]  But there are so many individuals out there who believe this is all there is in the world.
[00:45:20.618 --> 00:45:21.899]  Do as thou will.
[00:45:21.899 --> 00:45:22.820]  Feed on people.
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.521]  Hurt people.
[00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:24.902]  It's all about raw power.
[00:45:24.902 --> 00:45:25.863]  Hurt the innocent.
[00:45:25.863 --> 00:45:27.324]  Dumb people down.
[00:45:27.324 --> 00:45:32.048]  Use knowledge you have that others don't have against them in a bad way.
[00:45:32.048 --> 00:45:36.051]  And they will laugh at you and say, there is no God.
[00:45:36.051 --> 00:45:37.392]  There is nothing else.
[00:45:37.392 --> 00:45:38.853]  This life isn't a test.
[00:45:38.853 --> 00:45:39.874]  We're just animals.
[00:45:39.874 --> 00:45:41.376]  We're just protoplasm.
[00:45:41.376 --> 00:45:42.977]  We're just a bunch of cells.
[00:45:42.977 --> 00:45:43.918]  That's all this is.
[00:45:45.077 --> 00:45:51.779]  And they've hardened their hearts against what's written on their soul.
[00:45:51.779 --> 00:46:01.801]  And that's really the message here that I want to relay to people out there who have hardened their hearts, but who haven't hardened them completely.
[00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:11.484]  For those of you out there that it isn't too late to turn back, is that this life is a test.
[00:46:15.046 --> 00:46:33.150]  This life is extremely short and what matters in life is the decisions you make to do the right thing and to be an honorable person and to help others and to strive to by degrees develop yourself
[00:46:38.115 --> 00:46:51.467]  Into someone who is striving to be closer to the Creator and everything that's good and all the blessings that flow from creation and life.
[00:46:51.467 --> 00:47:04.478]  And it's very, very sad to see people so caught up in the world, so mesmerized by it, so turned completely over to it, that they are blinded to what really matters.
[00:47:05.862 --> 00:47:07.303]  That's why I don't fear death.
[00:47:07.303 --> 00:47:09.804]  That's why I don't fear the pain of death.
[00:47:09.804 --> 00:47:19.848]  That's why I don't fear the loss of control.
[00:47:19.848 --> 00:47:25.811]  Because I understand it's all part of a process and what it is to be a human being.
[00:47:25.811 --> 00:47:34.575]  And I say to those of you out there who have not had these experiences in life that give you a window into other worlds.
[00:47:36.209 --> 00:47:58.560]  That you need to get your heart and mind and soul right with the universe and to ask God to open up your soul and to show you the wider plane of existence so that you can develop and so that you don't miss out on the true secrets, the true mysteries of life.
[00:48:00.868 --> 00:48:05.892]  Now on the other side of that, there's the blind and the people that are just turned over to petty evil.
[00:48:05.892 --> 00:48:29.091]  There's also those on the true dark side that are fully aware of all of this and have made the conscious decision to understand these great truths and to use them against their fellow human beings for earthly and carnal power on this limited
[00:48:30.356 --> 00:48:33.497]  Third dimensional plane that we exist on.
[00:48:33.497 --> 00:48:47.363]  You know I think about Colonel Craig Roberts and I tried last minute to get him on today but he's busy helping a neighbor take a tractor in to get a new tire put on it.
[00:48:47.363 --> 00:48:53.045]  Lives out in the countryside in Oklahoma.
[00:48:53.045 --> 00:48:58.928]  But the story he told about how he died on the operating table and I believe he said he was
[00:48:59.943 --> 00:49:06.709]  They quit trying to resuscitate him and he was dead, completely dead for more than six minutes.
[00:49:06.709 --> 00:49:23.124]  They had walked away from the table and then he awoke and to be there and to describe what millions and millions of others have described, to have this presence behind him, this angel that had recorded his entire life, to see his life flash before his eyes and then to be
[00:49:24.639 --> 00:49:27.100]  Taken up before two portals.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.900]  One portal that he knew was a bad place.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:35.422]  One portal that he wanted to go to that was the most wonderful thing that he could have ever even possibly imagined.
[00:49:35.422 --> 00:49:44.504]  And to literally then be downloaded with information and told, you are being sent back to speak out against the New World Order.
[00:49:44.504 --> 00:49:46.524]  And that happened to him.
[00:49:46.524 --> 00:49:49.925]  And that's happened to so many other people.
[00:49:49.925 --> 00:49:52.025]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are true stories.
[00:49:52.025 --> 00:49:53.746]  These things happened.
[00:49:54.941 --> 00:49:57.002]  I had a dream about the Grim Reaper.
[00:49:57.002 --> 00:50:00.523]  I saw the Grim Reaper for the first time in my life.
[00:50:00.523 --> 00:50:03.624]  I witnessed it last night.
[00:50:03.624 --> 00:50:14.988]  And then I had a comforting dream after that and was there with others that experienced something similar.
[00:50:14.988 --> 00:50:15.588]  I'm sure of it.
[00:50:18.447 --> 00:50:28.435]  I didn't have time this morning, or for some reason I didn't ask my dad if anything happened last night, but the point is you've all experienced things that are similar.
[00:50:28.435 --> 00:50:31.157]  You've all experienced it.
[00:50:31.157 --> 00:50:39.884]  Even those of you that have hardened your hearts, if you think back, I'm sure you have been given glimpses.
[00:50:39.884 --> 00:50:45.788]  So understand that what you do today, you will be judged for.
[00:50:45.788 --> 00:50:47.490]  And understand this is all a great test.
[00:50:50.031 --> 00:50:56.217]  And face that fact and realize there are more things in heaven and earth than in all the books.
[00:50:56.217 --> 00:50:57.599]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:57.599 --> 00:51:00.782]  Get into all the news, take your phone calls, and a lot more.
[00:51:00.782 --> 00:51:04.205]  When you're ready to purify your family's drinking water and save money.
[00:51:04.205 --> 00:51:11.673]  When you're ready to remove contaminants like chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, pharmaceutical drugs, and even iron and rust from your water and save money.
[00:51:11.673 --> 00:51:14.155]  When you're ready to enjoy crisp, clean water and
[00:51:14.155 --> 00:51:16.876]  If you want to save money, go to PureWaterFreedom.com.
[00:51:16.876 --> 00:51:19.298]  How much will you save at PureWaterFreedom.com?
[00:51:19.298 --> 00:51:22.739]  Our competition sells fluoride filters between $150 and $200.
[00:51:22.739 --> 00:51:25.661]  Our price, $99.
[00:51:25.661 --> 00:51:28.682]  They sell reverse osmosis systems for $600.
[00:51:28.682 --> 00:51:31.864]  Our under sink reverse osmosis system is only $249.
[00:51:31.864 --> 00:51:38.407]  PureWaterFreedom.com offers state-of-the-art water filters for every application for home or office.
[00:51:38.507 --> 00:51:38.947]  I think so.
[00:52:01.937 --> 00:52:05.941]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.941 --> 00:52:09.204]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.204 --> 00:52:14.009]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.009 --> 00:52:20.395]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.395 --> 00:52:22.638]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:23.138 --> 00:52:23.458]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:23.458 --> 00:52:23.978]  Bernanke?
[00:52:23.978 --> 00:52:24.779]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:24.779 --> 00:52:25.899]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:25.899 --> 00:52:28.501]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:28.501 --> 00:52:30.081]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:30.081 --> 00:52:31.882]  And right now in Washington, D.C.
[00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:49.351]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:53:01.457 --> 00:53:05.762]  Food security from eFoodsDirect, the most valuable protection your family can have.
[00:53:05.762 --> 00:53:07.264]  It's a scary world we live in.
[00:53:07.264 --> 00:53:11.628]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death, all from the swine flu.
[00:53:11.628 --> 00:53:15.313]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[00:53:15.313 --> 00:53:22.661]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper, due to the nation's 12 trillion dollar debt, which is why gold is now over a thousand dollars an ounce.
[00:53:23.101 --> 00:53:32.228]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16% and the solution for every one of these threats to your family is food security from eFoodsDirect.

[00:54:15.439 --> 00:54:23.846]  I had one more point I wanted to make.
[00:54:23.846 --> 00:54:33.093]  I started to tell the story, the parable that Daryl Rhondas likes to tell.
[00:54:39.229 --> 00:54:41.431]  And it's absolutely true.
[00:54:41.431 --> 00:54:45.956]  What would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
[00:54:45.956 --> 00:55:01.211]  And when you tell someone giving over to the world that they laugh at you, they have a crazed look in their eye, they've hardened their heart, they covet their evil as if it's a possession, as if it's some treat.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.601]  And I have been taken up on the mountain by the world.
[00:55:05.601 --> 00:55:08.403]  I've been offered great things.
[00:55:08.403 --> 00:55:16.247]  And that only confirms to me even more, when the corporate world's tried to buy me off in the past, just how real this is.
[00:55:16.247 --> 00:55:20.850]  Now I'm on the White House enemies list, and it's confirmed that they have one.
[00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:27.993]  Mainstream news, Rogel Call and AP and other publications, we're going to cover that next hour.
[00:55:27.993 --> 00:55:30.855]  But Daryl tells the parable of, you go up to somebody,
[00:55:33.291 --> 00:55:43.413]  And you say, I'll give you $1,000 to surgically have your eyes removed and to give them to me.
[00:55:43.413 --> 00:55:45.633]  And they'll say, no way.
[00:55:45.633 --> 00:55:47.394]  Okay, I'll give you 10,000.
[00:55:47.394 --> 00:55:49.394]  Never, I'll give you a million.
[00:55:49.394 --> 00:55:53.175]  No, I'll give you a billion.
[00:55:53.175 --> 00:55:57.216]  No way, buddy, are you taking my eyes?
[00:55:57.216 --> 00:55:59.276]  Well, the eyes are only the window to the soul.
[00:56:00.643 --> 00:56:10.630]  In the embryonic phase of the baby developing, the brain literally grows two stalks that come out and form in the face of the skull.
[00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:14.232]  The eyes are brain tissue.
[00:56:14.232 --> 00:56:20.496]  You look into someone's eyes, you're looking into their mind.
[00:56:20.496 --> 00:56:26.080]  The most important of the five senses that science records and documents
[00:56:28.507 --> 00:56:29.928]  Well, what would you give for your intellect?
[00:56:29.928 --> 00:56:31.850]  What would you give for who you are?
[00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:33.431]  What you are?
[00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:34.752]  Nothing.
[00:56:34.752 --> 00:56:38.876]  Well, then why would you give your soul over to corruption and evil for petty power?
[00:56:38.876 --> 00:56:42.939]  For sex?
[00:56:42.939 --> 00:56:44.341]  For wealth?
[00:56:44.341 --> 00:56:47.343]  For status?
[00:56:47.343 --> 00:56:50.125]  Then you realize how foolish it is to sell out.
[00:56:50.125 --> 00:56:53.388]  But see, we sell out by degree, and we've all done it one way or the other.
[00:56:53.388 --> 00:56:54.149]  None of us are perfect.
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:08.451]  But it's always possible, unless you've completely given yourself over and committed so many crimes against the innocent that you're too far gone, but it's almost always possible to turn back.
[00:57:08.451 --> 00:57:12.715]  To turn back on the road.
[00:57:12.715 --> 00:57:16.458]  The road to perdition.
[00:57:16.458 --> 00:57:17.920]  And that's the choice we all make.
[00:57:20.009 --> 00:57:31.093]  But by increments we see the media, the culture, the establishment selling us on violence, death, destruction, torture, secret arrest, black uniforms, all the trappings of classical evil.
[00:57:31.093 --> 00:57:33.334]  We know how it manifests in a nation.
[00:57:33.334 --> 00:57:35.215]  We know how it manifests in a culture.
[00:57:35.215 --> 00:57:36.836]  We know what we're seeing.
[00:57:36.836 --> 00:57:37.896]  We know what it is.
[00:57:37.896 --> 00:57:43.999]  If you have a thimble of discernment or understanding, you would see it.
[00:57:43.999 --> 00:57:48.500]  But you are becoming spiritually blind because you're losing your sight.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:49.521]  You're losing your
[00:57:51.206 --> 00:57:53.067]  Discernment.
[00:57:53.067 --> 00:58:03.251]  If you can't see all of this around you, it's because from birth you were sat down in front of the television and weren't taught any wisdom.
[00:58:03.251 --> 00:58:06.072]  But it's not too late for you to turn back.
[00:58:06.072 --> 00:58:20.878]  And I beg of thee, out there, many of you that think that evil is powerful, who are allured like a moth towards flame to darkness, towards wicked energy, to turn back.
[00:58:22.725 --> 00:58:28.189]  So that you not be cut off from all that is good in the universe.
[00:58:28.189 --> 00:58:40.899]  So that you not succumb to the gravitational pull, the vortices, the vortex, the nexus of pain and destruction unfolding against our species.
[00:58:40.899 --> 00:58:45.923]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:49.552 --> 00:59:00.522]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about a Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[00:59:00.522 --> 00:59:02.124]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:59:02.124 --> 00:59:03.205]  It's very real.
[00:59:03.205 --> 00:59:03.565]  I know.
[00:59:03.565 --> 00:59:07.789]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.

[00:59:53.511 --> 00:59:55.893]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.893 --> 00:59:58.615]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.273 --> 01:00:10.099]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.099 --> 01:00:11.700]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.242]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:17.447]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:21.492]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.939 --> 01:00:25.999]  We are now into hour number two.
[01:00:25.999 --> 01:00:29.080]  It is the date of October 21st, 2009.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:40.302]  The drop date in T-minus three hours of Fall of the Republic at PrisonPlanet.tv for all the members.
[01:00:40.302 --> 01:00:42.282]  It's $5.95 for a monthly membership.
[01:00:42.282 --> 01:00:48.423]  You can get three months free when you sign up for a year or just get a trial one month membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:48.423 --> 01:00:52.784]  All my films we simulcast every day at least the last two hours in living color.
[01:00:53.604 --> 01:00:58.807]  The radio show via a TV program at PrisonPlanet.TV as well.
[01:00:58.807 --> 01:01:00.948]  A ton of news and information.
[01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:06.050]  We're going to have first-time callers only in the first few hours of the broadcast today.
[01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:08.291]  We'll open the phones up to general calls later.
[01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:12.514]  But I want people to have a chance who were never able to get through to call in.
[01:01:12.514 --> 01:01:13.914]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:13.914 --> 01:01:13.974]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:22.193 --> 01:01:26.675]  Did any of the information I just discussed touch your heart?
[01:01:26.675 --> 01:01:30.436]  Do you have any similar stories you'd like to tell?
[01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:31.597]  Events you'd like to discuss?
[01:01:31.597 --> 01:01:36.019]  Would you like to talk about the White House enemies list now being confirmed in more mainstream media?
[01:01:36.019 --> 01:01:40.381]  A senator going to the floor and speaking about it?
[01:01:40.381 --> 01:01:42.221]  You want to discuss all the flu hype?
[01:01:42.221 --> 01:01:43.262]  So much is going on.
[01:01:43.262 --> 01:01:45.983]  I have three big stacks of important news I'm going to be discussing.
[01:01:49.465 --> 01:01:52.806]  We'll be breaking it all down today.
[01:01:52.806 --> 01:01:53.486]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:53.486 --> 01:01:58.028]  Here's one of many reports I have I'll be covering.
[01:01:58.028 --> 01:02:00.129]  OnStar ends first police chase.
[01:02:00.129 --> 01:02:06.391]  That little OnStar button on the rearview mirror of your General Motors car can do a lot of things.
[01:02:06.391 --> 01:02:10.072]  This week the system was used to end a high-speed car chase for the first time.
[01:02:10.072 --> 01:02:16.454]  Now I remember a decade ago when they were developing this, telling people it would be used to turn your car off, to lock you down, to lock you in your car.
[01:02:18.137 --> 01:02:20.039]  It was even a talk show host.
[01:02:20.039 --> 01:02:20.740]  What was his name?
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.961]  His name will pop in my head in a minute.
[01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:24.844]  He was from Colorado, who did a parable.
[01:02:24.844 --> 01:02:28.507]  I haven't been able to find it last time I looked for it, about OnStar.
[01:02:28.507 --> 01:02:39.178]  He did a little spoof, where the person's locked in their car by the police with it.
[01:02:39.178 --> 01:02:39.778]  So we'll be...
[01:02:41.561 --> 01:02:43.661]  We'll be breaking this down.
[01:02:43.661 --> 01:02:50.483]  Also, the face scanning cameras going in, the license plate reading cameras, how that ties into the no-fly list, no-gun-buy list.
[01:02:50.483 --> 01:02:52.083]  You're just going to be tracked everywhere.
[01:02:52.083 --> 01:03:00.244]  And even if you had a credit card, you won't be able to buy or sell without your face scan and your handprint accessing it.
[01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:04.005]  And that's not revelations out of the Bible, if you don't even believe in that.
[01:03:04.005 --> 01:03:05.105]  That's what's happening.
[01:03:05.105 --> 01:03:06.025]  That's reality.
[01:03:06.025 --> 01:03:06.905]  That's veritas.
[01:03:06.905 --> 01:03:09.026]  That's truth.
[01:03:09.026 --> 01:03:10.226]  Of course, it is revelations.
[01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:17.652]  We got an incredible situation on our hands as a society and as a world.
[01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:32.057]  And those of you out there that haven't gotten yourselves right with the Creator, and I don't mean all the whorehouse fake New World Order churches and all the religionists and all their propaganda.
[01:03:32.057 --> 01:03:34.278]  See, the elite are all into the occult.
[01:03:34.278 --> 01:03:37.481]  They believe in spiritual forces.
[01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.102]  They know all of this exists.
[01:03:39.102 --> 01:03:44.606]  They want to blind you fully because the devil's biggest trick is convincing the world he doesn't exist.
[01:03:46.084 --> 01:03:50.966]  And that's why a lot of people don't want to hear about this type of stuff because it stings their conscience.
[01:03:50.966 --> 01:03:53.146]  It's painful to listen to.
[01:03:53.146 --> 01:04:11.232]  And the world has put up all these fake Bible thumpers and churchgoers and Pharisees and Sadducees and all the proud holier-than-thou individuals to put a bad face on being a spiritual person and getting right with God.
[01:04:11.232 --> 01:04:14.493]  It's all been done by design.
[01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:26.523]  Just like they demonized the Patriot and Liberty Movement by focusing in on ne'er-do-wells or lunatics or, more often than not, government operatives who are there to discredit what we're doing.
[01:04:26.523 --> 01:04:29.785]  I mean, it's simple tricks they play.
[01:04:29.785 --> 01:04:39.272]  And once you're aware of the designs, once you're aware of the snares, the darts, you can navigate through them.
[01:04:39.272 --> 01:04:44.936]  But then you begin to fully turn yourself over to the compulsion.
[01:04:46.704 --> 01:04:50.145]  To warn others about these systems so that they not be caught in them.
[01:04:50.145 --> 01:05:00.408]  And it's very sad to watch people frothing and flailing and jerking through the system as they're attacked by the psych warfare operatives.
[01:05:00.408 --> 01:05:05.730]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:07.811]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:05:07.811 --> 01:05:10.251]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.251 --> 01:05:12.532]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.532 --> 01:05:14.153]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.153 --> 01:05:15.193]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.413 --> 01:05:23.842]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:05:23.842 --> 01:05:31.310]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:36.956]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:05:37.336 --> 01:05:43.359]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:05:43.359 --> 01:05:47.501]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:54.965]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[01:05:54.965 --> 01:05:58.267]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:03.738]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:06:03.738 --> 01:06:07.360]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.942]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:11.942 --> 01:06:17.525]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.825 --> 01:06:22.588]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.588 --> 01:06:26.211]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.211 --> 01:06:31.034]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:31.034 --> 01:06:37.598]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:06:37.598 --> 01:06:39.540]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.222]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:06:43.222 --> 01:06:47.724]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[01:06:47.724 --> 01:06:49.965]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:06:49.965 --> 01:06:50.245]  877-327-0365.
[01:06:50.245 --> 01:06:50.985]  Don't wait, call today!
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:06.521]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[01:07:06.521 --> 01:07:10.022]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[01:07:10.022 --> 01:07:15.743]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[01:07:15.743 --> 01:07:18.303]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[01:07:18.303 --> 01:07:22.844]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[01:07:22.844 --> 01:07:25.565]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[01:07:26.005 --> 01:07:31.753]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[01:07:31.753 --> 01:07:33.996]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:07:33.996 --> 01:07:42.567]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[01:07:42.567 --> 01:07:43.569]  Don't pick your nose.
[01:07:43.929 --> 01:07:48.493]  Don't shake hands, and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[01:07:48.493 --> 01:07:53.617]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[01:07:53.617 --> 01:07:55.379]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[01:07:55.379 --> 01:07:57.581]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:07:57.581 --> 01:07:59.322]  Be well and stay well.
[01:07:59.322 --> 01:08:01.925]  Best MZ.
[01:08:01.925 --> 01:08:04.707]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:07.509]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.687 --> 01:08:16.073]  We're going to be taking your phone calls here in a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:16.073 --> 01:08:20.017]  John Harmon up there in Minnesota at Mission Control.
[01:08:20.017 --> 01:08:22.019]  I'm down here at Cape Canaveral, Austin, Texas.
[01:08:22.019 --> 01:08:25.262]  They're up at Mission Control, Minneapolis, St.
[01:08:25.262 --> 01:08:27.404]  Paul.
[01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:32.308]  He popped in my ear and said, yeah, the talk show host was Michael Corbin.
[01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:33.690]  He died a couple years ago.
[01:08:35.629 --> 01:08:56.099]  And he made this great parody and I looked for it on YouTube a few months ago and couldn't find it so hopefully one of our great listeners will grab the audio of this today and put it up on YouTube because this certainly is a great parody that he put together.
[01:08:56.099 --> 01:09:00.301]  But I remember reading DARPA documents that were declassified.
[01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:03.022]  I remember researching more than
[01:09:04.281 --> 01:09:14.208]  More than 10 years ago, how they planned to put, in the name of safety, satellite tracker boxes in all the cars standard.
[01:09:14.208 --> 01:09:20.492]  And then right after that OnStar came out, but now most of the other big car companies also put it in the car.
[01:09:20.492 --> 01:09:28.198]  And GM's been making airplanes and tanks and weapon systems for 80-something years, General Motors.
[01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:31.180]  And so you better know it's a military industrial complex company.
[01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:54.167]  And I remember warning listeners that the FBI was using OnStarb in the last eight years to dial in without warrants, because it's a cell phone, is really all it is, with GPS triangulation off of the cell towers, that they can dial into your car and listen to you without a warrant.
[01:09:54.167 --> 01:10:01.173]  And then it came out in the news in the last few years, and indeed they have been using it without warrants to listen to people.
[01:10:02.085 --> 01:10:10.452]  Now, through Homeland Security and Threat Fusion, Threat Integration Centers, the first time I saw it in mainstream news was 2003.
[01:10:10.452 --> 01:10:14.015]  It's in my film, Matrix of Evil, if you want to check it out.
[01:10:14.015 --> 01:10:25.626]  The Green Bay newspaper had the governor, who I guess spoke about something classified before he was supposed to, giving a tour of a facility in the state of Wisconsin.
[01:10:26.673 --> 01:10:37.209]  And saying, yes, look, in real time we can type in somebody's driver's license number or social security number or cell phone number and it will pinpoint down to 15 feet where they are off of their cell phones.
[01:10:38.629 --> 01:10:42.570]  So that's what's being integrated in these local centers are really federalization centers.
[01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:48.072]  They're integrating the military, the CIA, the FBI into them, totally taking over your town.
[01:10:48.072 --> 01:10:55.234]  Here in Austin, they have admitted members of Army psychological warfare operations running the new carbon tax.
[01:10:55.234 --> 01:10:58.835]  They're going to have city carbon taxes run by Pentagon operatives.
[01:10:58.835 --> 01:10:59.515]  I mean, it's just...
[01:11:00.732 --> 01:11:03.333]  Unspeakable grid of control!
[01:11:03.333 --> 01:11:10.954]  Because they knew they were going to implode the economy, they knew they were going to bring in tyranny, they had to deploy Homeland Security Brigades, regular army.
[01:11:10.954 --> 01:11:13.935]  This is to suppress us!
[01:11:13.935 --> 01:11:27.138]  And they're going to stage terror attacks against the military and blame it on the American people, so the military will get past their allergy, or their resistance, as the establishment sees it, towards policing and pulling triggers on the American people.
[01:11:28.319 --> 01:11:34.406]  And they're having urban warfare drills, and then live-action drills, and then checkpoints for DWIs.
[01:11:34.406 --> 01:11:37.509]  Oh, aren't you for stopping drunk drivers with the Marines and the Army?
[01:11:37.509 --> 01:11:41.434]  To acclimate, to make it sound like it's good up front.
[01:11:41.434 --> 01:11:45.578]  Selling it to the public as if it's a wonderful thing.
[01:11:45.578 --> 01:11:49.603]  And they have a million two hundred thousand plus Americans as of
[01:11:51.519 --> 01:12:19.760]  Eleven months ago, they reported in January when they made the list secret, the list is secret but the numbers on it are now secret, that a million two hundred thousand people were on it, and that twenty five thousand plus were being added a month, and then a bunch of, well, one of the heads of the Air Police, of the Federal Marshals, Air Marshals, went public in the Denver Post and said, look, we're ordered to put innocent people on this list.
[01:12:21.018 --> 01:12:29.185]  For ordering vegetarian meals when they buy a ticket at the airport or for a five-year-old snapping a photo when they're inside the airplane.
[01:12:29.185 --> 01:12:37.391]  We are ordered to put people every month on the list for life, you can't get off of it, to create the illusion of a terror threat.
[01:12:37.391 --> 01:12:40.153]  So I wanted to add that little tidbit that it's innocent people.
[01:12:40.153 --> 01:12:43.676]  Then they announced, as I told you they would do years ago, I know their operations.
[01:12:43.676 --> 01:12:47.839]  It's clear, it's like having a jigsaw puzzle that there's a hundred pieces and 95 of them are in
[01:12:50.569 --> 01:12:56.972]  In place, and you're looking to put the last five pieces in, I mean, it's as easy as kiss my hand to do it.
[01:12:56.972 --> 01:13:02.335]  I mean, it's as easy as chewing a stick of bubblegum.
[01:13:02.335 --> 01:13:06.857]  I mean, you can do it blindfolded.
[01:13:06.857 --> 01:13:07.738]  You know.
[01:13:07.738 --> 01:13:11.760]  That's why everything I talk about comes true, because I'm just telling you all the other pieces.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.100]  I'm thinking of thousands right now.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.982]  We don't have time to go through them all, and I know what's going on.
[01:13:17.099 --> 01:13:25.822]  And they are saying that if you haven't paid all your taxes, or you have bad credit, you're not going to be able to fly, and then you're not going to be able to get on buses, and you're not going to be able to go in shopping malls.
[01:13:25.822 --> 01:13:28.703]  They're going to put metal detectors in shopping malls and set up checkpoints.
[01:13:28.703 --> 01:13:30.384]  That was announced five years ago.
[01:13:30.384 --> 01:13:37.567]  Now they've put out a new fake terror alert with some supposed Al-Qaeda person who wanted to attack shopping malls.
[01:13:37.567 --> 01:13:38.287]  It's all happening.
[01:13:42.847 --> 01:14:05.849]  And they use OnStar to listen to you, and I told you that many of the, and I've seen this for the last close to a decade, many of the bigger used car companies, and now even the smaller ones, right here in Austin where I live, and I first saw it in Los Angeles and New York, put a kill switch in your car until your car is paid off in the ignition.
[01:14:07.506 --> 01:14:10.387]  Only cost a few hundred bucks, and they charge you for it.
[01:14:10.387 --> 01:14:15.087]  And if you try to remove it, it's triggered to where your car won't start.
[01:14:15.087 --> 01:14:19.448]  So until you've paid your car off, that kill switch is in there.
[01:14:19.448 --> 01:14:28.870]  But I've noticed, talking to people that have had it, they never go get it taken out, and if they do, they just say, oh, keep it, we'd have to charge you to take it out.
[01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:31.751]  The truth is, they're getting a kickback from the company to leave it in.
[01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:33.991]  And I remember seeing, oh, probably five years ago,
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.361]  That in Los Angeles, that's the real CIA testing ground more than any other city.
[01:14:40.361 --> 01:14:45.602]  New York and Boston are starting to, and Dallas are starting to get almost as bad with CIA funding.
[01:14:45.602 --> 01:14:52.163]  That via helicopter or police cars, they have special units that have kill switches where they aim it at your car.
[01:14:52.163 --> 01:14:54.304]  The problem is it can kill other cars around it.
[01:14:54.304 --> 01:14:58.845]  But they aim it at your car with a radio signal and it turns your car off.
[01:14:59.741 --> 01:15:00.061]  But that's
[01:15:15.657 --> 01:15:17.678]  Well, it was most cars six, eight years ago.
[01:15:17.678 --> 01:15:25.122]  Now, it's all cars by law, have a box in them that tracks how fast you're driving, what really happened when you wrecked.
[01:15:25.122 --> 01:15:26.762]  They then use that to charge you.
[01:15:26.762 --> 01:15:29.724]  I mean, total control grids are being built into everything.
[01:15:29.724 --> 01:15:34.286]  Computers, iPhones, all cell phones, cars.
[01:15:34.286 --> 01:15:38.148]  And on top of that is the OnStar.
[01:15:38.148 --> 01:15:38.908]  Now, this is U.S.
[01:15:38.908 --> 01:15:40.029]  News and World Report.
[01:15:40.029 --> 01:15:41.870]  They're just now introducing it to the slaves.
[01:15:45.697 --> 01:15:49.878]  And even if your OnStar was never activated, they can still kill your car with it.
[01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:52.159]  They can activate it instantly.
[01:15:52.159 --> 01:15:54.679]  And notice how they phrase it as if it's wonderful.
[01:15:54.679 --> 01:15:58.460]  How they package it and present it as if it's the best thing in the world.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.120]  That's how a Ponzi scheme works.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:06.542]  When some Ponzi scammer comes into the country club and gets one old lady to invest 10 grand with her, the next week she gets 30 grand back.
[01:16:07.293 --> 01:16:11.056]  At first it's good, so that it looks good so everybody jumps on board.
[01:16:11.056 --> 01:16:18.100]  Oh look, the Marines are running checkpoints in New York and Vermont and Kentucky and in California stopping drunks.
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:21.683]  Oh look, the Army's out helping at Car Wrecks with the Jaws of Life.
[01:16:21.683 --> 01:16:23.144]  You're not against the Army helping.
[01:16:23.144 --> 01:16:25.826]  That young girl might have died.
[01:16:25.826 --> 01:16:27.147]  See how they phrase it?
[01:16:27.147 --> 01:16:30.649]  Look at how they're phrasing it here, how they're presenting it.
[01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:33.511]  It's like a feed block or range cubes or a corn
[01:16:36.809 --> 01:16:38.030]  Deer feeder.
[01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:43.674]  Yeah, it's good the first 20 times the deer eat out of it until the day you're in the deer stand and shoot them.
[01:16:43.674 --> 01:16:45.695]  That's how this works.
[01:16:45.695 --> 01:16:48.317]  OnStar ends first police chase.
[01:16:48.317 --> 01:16:53.461]  That little OnStar button on the rearview mirror of General Motors car can do a lot of things.
[01:16:53.461 --> 01:16:59.945]  This week the system was used to end a high-speed chase for the first time.
[01:16:59.945 --> 01:17:05.129]  The AP reports police in California say General Motors OnStar communication system stopped a dangerous high-speed chase
[01:17:06.164 --> 01:17:11.286]  And help them capture a carjacking suspect by disabling the stolen sport utility vehicle.
[01:17:11.286 --> 01:17:17.229]  The Chevy Tahoe was stolen by a carjacker who used a sawed-off shotgun to threaten the driver into giving up the car.
[01:17:17.229 --> 01:17:19.310]  So see, it's a carjacker, aren't you for it?
[01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:23.871]  Police contacted OnStar, which found the Tahoe by using a global positioning system.
[01:17:23.871 --> 01:17:26.813]  Two officers spotted the SUV, but the driver sped off.
[01:17:26.813 --> 01:17:31.194]  That's when OnStar operators sent a signal that slowed the Tahoe to a halt.
[01:17:31.194 --> 01:17:32.095]  And it goes on to say,
[01:17:33.462 --> 01:17:37.988]  They didn't have to pursue it quickly and endanger other drivers because they knew they could kill the car.
[01:17:37.988 --> 01:17:42.795]  And that stopped a potentially dangerous high-speed chase.
[01:17:42.795 --> 01:17:45.158]  The thief was captured on foot, kicking...
[01:17:46.246 --> 01:17:54.510]  Tire Notes reports that last year, 334 people were killed around the country in police pursuits, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
[01:17:54.510 --> 01:18:05.295]  Then I have other reports here where it says Vehicle Tracking Bill introduced in the House, where by law, you have to have these in your car so they can kill your car.
[01:18:05.295 --> 01:18:09.097]  Now, imagine in the future when there is a checkpoint.
[01:18:09.097 --> 01:18:11.458]  Imagine in the future when there's a lockdown in the city.
[01:18:11.458 --> 01:18:13.719]  They just hit a button and kill every car in the city.
[01:18:15.069 --> 01:18:17.409]  Or you try to go around their checkpoint with your family.
[01:18:17.409 --> 01:18:19.230]  They just kill your car.
[01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:21.470]  They are stating that's what this is really for.
[01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:22.910]  This is in everything.
[01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:24.211]  They want to know what you're saying.
[01:18:24.211 --> 01:18:26.451]  They dial your number, put it in a key code.
[01:18:26.451 --> 01:18:31.752]  In any police department in the country, the police are now being told about this department by department.
[01:18:31.752 --> 01:18:35.653]  If you haven't been told yet, you will be.
[01:18:35.653 --> 01:18:40.674]  My father driving through East Texas got pulled over.
[01:18:40.674 --> 01:18:42.294]  It was a six-year-old Passat.
[01:18:42.294 --> 01:18:42.874]  I'd sold him.
[01:18:46.482 --> 01:18:48.603]  We need a bigger car because we have more kids.
[01:18:48.603 --> 01:18:49.744]  Sold it to my dad.
[01:18:49.744 --> 01:18:50.984]  He liked the car.
[01:18:50.984 --> 01:18:51.725]  He got pulled over.
[01:18:51.725 --> 01:18:53.706]  The cop came over all freaked out.
[01:18:53.706 --> 01:18:57.088]  Said you were speeding over the speed limit, but I'm going to let you off.
[01:18:57.088 --> 01:19:00.149]  But you're not Alex Jones.
[01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:05.072]  And he went on to say that they were dialed in to a Lexus Nexus slash Reuters system
[01:19:06.178 --> 01:19:10.621]  With Homeland Security, where they integrate all these private databases and they knew all about it.
[01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:17.687]  And then I was, basically had a handle with CARE, you know, dangerous person.
[01:19:17.687 --> 01:19:19.488]  That's America, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:23.111]  And those files and fake dossiers are like FBI files.
[01:19:23.111 --> 01:19:25.373]  They're full of baloney and disinformation.
[01:19:26.169 --> 01:19:27.270]  On purpose.
[01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:29.792]  This is the country we live in, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:29.792 --> 01:19:32.974]  This is the worldwide Pentagon grid they're putting in place.
[01:19:32.974 --> 01:19:36.337]  And earlier I mentioned the no-fly list.
[01:19:36.337 --> 01:19:47.286]  This is going to be when you try to go into a store and pay for something with a credit card, by law the face-scanning camera behind the register, even if your card is good, you're not a good little globalist, you're not going to be able to buy anything.
[01:19:47.286 --> 01:19:50.348]  This is how they're going to hunt everybody down.
[01:19:50.348 --> 01:19:52.630]  This is already in place.
[01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:55.192]  This is a trillion times worse than whatever Hitler did.
[01:19:56.479 --> 01:20:01.823]  We'll come back, play this OnStar piece, take your phone calls, Paul Watson's coming up.
[01:20:01.823 --> 01:20:03.063]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[01:20:03.063 --> 01:20:04.925]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:06.766]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[01:20:06.766 --> 01:20:11.669]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:16.693]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.

[01:21:01.104 --> 01:21:02.144]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:02.144 --> 01:21:07.086]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:21:07.086 --> 01:21:15.168]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:21:15.168 --> 01:21:20.750]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:27.712]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:21:28.012 --> 01:21:33.618]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:21:33.618 --> 01:21:38.682]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:21:38.682 --> 01:21:46.630]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:49.333]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[01:21:49.773 --> 01:21:53.174]  Gold, on its own, has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:57.035]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:57.035 --> 01:22:01.716]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:05.718]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:22:05.718 --> 01:22:08.958]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:14.200]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:17.621]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[01:22:18.263 --> 01:22:20.144]  And they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:20.144 --> 01:22:25.347]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:25.347 --> 01:22:35.453]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:35.453 --> 01:22:37.814]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:37.814 --> 01:22:39.395]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:39.395 --> 01:22:41.856]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:43.977]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:43.977 --> 01:22:46.739]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[01:22:47.479 --> 01:22:49.100]  A fall of the Republic.
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:23:00.245]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:00.245 --> 01:23:02.886]  Worried that inflation will destroy your savings?
[01:23:02.886 --> 01:23:04.047]  Grab a pencil.
[01:23:04.047 --> 01:23:13.051]  I'll tell you how to turn $10,000 into potentially $431,000 in 12 to 18 months, thanks to Obama.
[01:23:13.051 --> 01:23:15.592]  And this isn't about gold bullion or coins.
[01:23:15.592 --> 01:23:16.933]  It's about gold stocks.
[01:23:17.313 --> 01:23:20.095]  They have soared over 800% since the year 2000.
[01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:29.960]  This is with gold being less than $1,000, a figure that should go to between $1,500 and $2,500 according to Merrill Lynch and UBS.
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:41.165]  Even better, wait till you hear what Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential and Investment Newsletter says in his free Investing in Gold kit.
[01:23:41.165 --> 01:23:46.408]  It highlights seven must-own stocks, including a stock with six-figure potential whose price
[01:23:50.356 --> 01:23:51.316]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[01:23:51.316 --> 01:23:53.197]  It was back when the country was strong.
[01:24:19.252 --> 01:24:24.435]  You tell them, Merle.
[01:24:24.435 --> 01:24:36.543]  Back before Elvis and before the Vietnam War came along.
[01:24:36.543 --> 01:24:39.364]  Before the Beatles and yesterday.
[01:24:42.105 --> 01:24:49.289]  I really am upset for the police and military, many of which who aren't evil, who are going to serve this evil system.
[01:24:49.289 --> 01:24:53.571]  The cashless society, control grid, the enslavement system, the technocracy.
[01:24:55.302 --> 01:25:05.265]  This thing is pure evil, no matter how many coats of paint, how many excuses they give to it, no matter how they say it's for everybody's own good.
[01:25:05.265 --> 01:25:06.905]  It's pure evil.
[01:25:06.905 --> 01:25:08.186]  It's not going to be abused.
[01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:11.226]  Abused means that it was being misused.
[01:25:11.226 --> 01:25:13.567]  No, it's designed to enslave.
[01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:16.728]  It's set up to bring in bondage.
[01:25:21.067 --> 01:25:25.768]  And Michael Corbin, great talk show host out of Colorado, filled in a few times here on the air for me.
[01:25:25.768 --> 01:25:27.309]  He suddenly died of a heart attack.
[01:25:27.309 --> 01:25:29.969]  It was a couple years ago out in Colorado.
[01:25:29.969 --> 01:25:36.611]  He made this little piece, and it's pure genius, tying in to what OnStar would be used for.
[01:25:36.611 --> 01:25:46.754]  The subjects we've covered here on this show, as they announce, no matter what car company it is, they're all getting standard OnStar-type systems for the police to just turn your car off.
[01:25:48.379 --> 01:25:53.243]  Or the government, owned by foreign banks to carry out its crimes against humanity.
[01:25:53.243 --> 01:25:59.188]  And if you're not a good little globalist, they're just going to turn your right to work, and your right to travel, and your right to own guns off.
[01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:01.470]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:04.112]  Pure, absolute, judge-dread tyranny.
[01:26:06.857 --> 01:26:10.979]  And all that matters is people's souls, their intellects, who they are, what side they're on.
[01:26:10.979 --> 01:26:13.521]  And I just want to give you the message of the police and military.
[01:26:13.521 --> 01:26:14.662]  This isn't our government.
[01:26:14.662 --> 01:26:15.582]  This isn't our country.
[01:26:15.582 --> 01:26:16.583]  It's been robbed.
[01:26:16.583 --> 01:26:18.724]  And you are working for pure evil.
[01:26:18.724 --> 01:26:19.644]  Just know that.
[01:26:19.644 --> 01:26:22.486]  And in your gut, you know that already.
[01:26:22.486 --> 01:26:30.471]  And it's okay for you to stay where you are and try to not violate people's rights and try to stand up and be a light in the darkness.
[01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:34.033]  But it's just going to get worse and worse until you're forced to make the decision to stand up.
[01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:39.858]  In even more bold a fashion.
[01:26:39.858 --> 01:26:41.540]  And I care about you.
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:46.723]  And I've apologized for the way I've ranted and raved at a primitive level, threatened by you.
[01:26:46.723 --> 01:26:52.407]  Because I know that only adds to the gang mentality of the us against them, and divides us.
[01:26:52.407 --> 01:26:53.948]  And that's what the system wants.
[01:26:53.948 --> 01:26:57.230]  But I'm telling you right now, this is pure evil we're dealing with.
[01:26:57.230 --> 01:27:00.312]  And you better get yourselves right, right now.
[01:27:00.312 --> 01:27:02.974]  And you know, right now in your soul, I'm telling you the truth.
[01:27:04.343 --> 01:27:06.044]  Let's play the Michael Corbin piece, here it is.
[01:27:26.933 --> 01:27:31.456]  I have a live shot of you from the NEO CONSTAR observation blimp in your area.
[01:27:31.456 --> 01:27:32.997]  I'm an old lady.
[01:27:32.997 --> 01:27:37.199]  Alright sir, looks like you have no outstanding warrants so you're not under vehicular detention.
[01:27:37.199 --> 01:27:42.562]  But it looks like you have some outstanding parking tickets in two counties.
[01:27:42.562 --> 01:27:47.464]  We'll need you to slide your National ID card for deduction before we can release you from the car.
[01:27:47.464 --> 01:27:50.966]  Slide it through the NEO CONSTAR console now.
[01:27:50.966 --> 01:27:52.167]  But I can't find it.
[01:27:52.167 --> 01:27:53.287]  I'm looking everywhere.
[01:27:53.287 --> 01:27:55.629]  I can't find my National ID card.
[01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.829]  Sir?
[01:28:07.818 --> 01:28:12.442]  And that is precisely what we're dealing with.
[01:28:12.442 --> 01:28:13.743]  It's not a joke.
[01:28:13.743 --> 01:28:15.765]  That's where this is going.
[01:28:38.621 --> 01:28:59.072]  And heaven help us, because we have an elite who openly write thousands of textbooks and documents and white papers how they're building a, quote, planetary regime, a planetary dictatorship to condition and train the public to accept our orderly extermination.
[01:28:59.072 --> 01:29:02.633]  And they're going to move incrementally.
[01:29:02.633 --> 01:29:03.974]  And that's all this is.
[01:29:03.974 --> 01:29:07.056]  It's very hard to fight something that's incremental.
[01:29:07.056 --> 01:29:07.676]  And it's happening.
[01:29:10.919 --> 01:29:20.282]  And we, as a society and as a civilization, have to make a decision on whether or not we're going to go along with all of this.
[01:29:20.282 --> 01:29:29.785]  I saw a comment on a YouTube video today, the video we posted where I'm reaching out to people to promote Fall of the Republic so we can save the Republic.
[01:29:29.785 --> 01:29:36.188]  There's a guy going, Alex, I really admire your work, but you're committing a sin, standing up against corruption.
[01:29:36.188 --> 01:29:38.508]  You're supposed to do what the Apostle Paul said and lay down.
[01:29:38.508 --> 01:29:39.689]  The Apostle Paul didn't say that.
[01:29:41.766 --> 01:29:43.347]  I mean, what, the Founding Fathers were wrong?
[01:29:43.347 --> 01:29:44.647]  We were wrong to fight Hitler?
[01:29:44.647 --> 01:29:51.490]  No, you're copping out.
[01:29:51.490 --> 01:29:52.871]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.871 --> 01:29:54.471]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.471 --> 01:29:58.093]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.291 --> 01:30:04.293]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.293 --> 01:30:09.618]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.618 --> 01:30:11.679]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.679 --> 01:30:16.683]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.683 --> 01:30:17.584]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.844 --> 01:30:18.965]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.965 --> 01:30:20.867]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.867 --> 01:30:21.928]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.928 --> 01:30:24.130]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.130 --> 01:30:25.471]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.471 --> 01:30:27.013]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:27.013 --> 01:30:32.278]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.278 --> 01:30:35.861]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.861 --> 01:30:39.325]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.665 --> 01:30:40.886]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.886 --> 01:30:41.807]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.807 --> 01:30:42.907]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.907 --> 01:30:43.828]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.828 --> 01:30:44.929]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.929 --> 01:30:47.971]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.971 --> 01:30:49.752]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.752 --> 01:30:50.673]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.259 --> 01:31:05.566]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.566 --> 01:31:10.092]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.092 --> 01:31:12.375]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.375 --> 01:31:13.997]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.997 --> 01:31:15.019]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.259 --> 01:31:23.685]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:23.685 --> 01:31:31.130]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:31:37.174 --> 01:31:42.758]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:43.178 --> 01:31:47.325]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:31:47.325 --> 01:31:54.316]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[01:31:54.316 --> 01:31:54.817]  866-762-9238.
[01:31:54.817 --> 01:31:58.122]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:10.221]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecolablu, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[01:32:10.221 --> 01:32:11.822]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:32:11.822 --> 01:32:12.903]  It's very real.
[01:32:12.903 --> 01:32:13.263]  I know.
[01:32:13.263 --> 01:32:17.487]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:32:17.487 --> 01:32:20.709]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:28.915]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecolablu atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[01:32:29.355 --> 01:32:36.037]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[01:32:36.037 --> 01:32:44.739]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:32:44.739 --> 01:32:49.461]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:49.461 --> 01:32:49.681]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:49.681 --> 01:32:50.821]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web
[01:32:57.043 --> 01:32:59.765]  At E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com today.
[01:32:59.765 --> 01:33:11.173]  I read the news today, oh boy.
[01:33:11.173 --> 01:33:19.679]  About a lucky man who made the grade.
[01:33:19.679 --> 01:33:23.162]  And though the news was rather sad,
[01:33:38.625 --> 01:33:42.565]  Okay, I have a very important program note for everyone.
[01:33:42.565 --> 01:33:46.506]  I'll just let the listeners know what's going on and what's happening here, and we're gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:33:46.506 --> 01:33:50.067]  And Paul Watson's coming up in the next hour, and then Webster Tarpley in the final hour.
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.181]  I have two big CDNs.
[01:33:56.181 --> 01:34:04.804]  And for people that don't know what those are, it's where you put your web content, your multimedia, your websites, on a system that has thousands of servers.
[01:34:04.804 --> 01:34:06.985]  So you don't just have one server that's yours.
[01:34:06.985 --> 01:34:08.486]  Your content's put on a bunch of servers.
[01:34:08.486 --> 01:34:12.568]  That's what Google and YouTube and all the big media sites use.
[01:34:12.568 --> 01:34:13.988]  They have hundreds of CDNs.
[01:34:13.988 --> 01:34:15.769]  We have two CDNs.
[01:34:15.769 --> 01:34:17.090]  But that's not the problem.
[01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:19.571]  Our CDNs aren't having the problem.
[01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:21.992]  Our servers, because you still have to have your own box,
[01:34:23.686 --> 01:34:32.788]  Especially if it's a dynamic site, your own server, to serve out the front page of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:34:32.788 --> 01:34:42.111]  And we have a lot of members at PrisonPlanet.TV and I also have it turned up where you can share your passcode with six people simultaneously.
[01:34:42.111 --> 01:34:42.991]  That's not the problem.
[01:34:44.329 --> 01:34:58.916]  But it is the problem because all those extra people that have the passcode are on the front page of PrisonPlanet.TV, hitting it over and over and over again, hitting refresh.
[01:34:58.916 --> 01:35:09.702]  They're on there and that's why I tend to launch films a day early, so that we can test out the servers.
[01:35:09.702 --> 01:35:11.263]  And I'm gonna launch this at 3 p.m.
[01:35:11.263 --> 01:35:11.603]  today.
[01:35:19.125 --> 01:35:24.630]  And whatever happens, it will be served up to members.
[01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:29.614]  It's just that there is a firestorm on the internet of people wanting to see the film.
[01:35:29.614 --> 01:35:37.421]  In fact, there are hundreds of times in the web traffic the number of people hitting PrisonPlanet.tv than are members.
[01:35:37.421 --> 01:35:40.023]  So most people going there aren't even members and can't even see it to begin with.
[01:35:42.298 --> 01:35:43.838]  We've got some workarounds with this.
[01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:46.919]  In fact, pull up prisonplanet.tv for me so I can just see it.
[01:35:46.919 --> 01:35:48.079]  They say it's up and down.
[01:35:48.079 --> 01:35:51.520]  I've got my two IT guys in there trying to figure this out.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.521]  We've never had anything like this.
[01:35:53.521 --> 01:36:00.723]  We didn't have any problem launching the Obama deception, and we haven't had trouble launching the other films.
[01:36:00.723 --> 01:36:09.605]  We've got a pretty robust system, but we may have to put... Look, I'll tell the IT guys what the answer is.
[01:36:10.549 --> 01:36:12.811]  In fact, go ahead and call Matt in here right now.
[01:36:12.811 --> 01:36:15.214]  I just want to talk to him on air.
[01:36:15.214 --> 01:36:17.276]  Tell him don't worry, we're not on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:17.276 --> 01:36:22.301]  He doesn't want to be on TV.
[01:36:22.301 --> 01:36:24.704]  Just call him in here and I'll tell him what I want done.
[01:36:24.704 --> 01:36:27.506]  And I'll see if this is an answer.
[01:36:27.506 --> 01:36:29.048]  We'll work through this together on air.
[01:36:29.048 --> 01:36:32.231]  I just have total transparency with what we do here in my office.
[01:36:32.231 --> 01:36:33.613]  Same thing happened with Charlie Sheen!
[01:36:35.267 --> 01:36:39.068]  We tried to upload the report at 8 a.m.
[01:36:39.068 --> 01:36:52.031]  that morning and the servers locked out and we three times, first it uploaded just the first half of the 20 minutes of the president, then it uploaded it without the links, then it uploaded it without the image at the bottom of his signature.
[01:36:52.031 --> 01:37:03.613]  You couldn't tell it was an image because it was a signature on white paper on a white website but that ended up screwing up the signature and the disclaimer and now we're having the same problem because I can't afford
[01:37:07.831 --> 01:37:15.158]  I can't afford to have a super mega robust system because only two or three times a year do we have this type of traffic.
[01:37:15.158 --> 01:37:21.123]  I already have a $400,000 internet bandwidth slash IT bill a year.
[01:37:21.123 --> 01:37:22.364]  And that's cheap.
[01:37:22.364 --> 01:37:25.207]  That's searching everywhere for the best and most inexpensive systems.
[01:37:25.207 --> 01:37:26.968]  So I can't afford anything better for members.
[01:37:26.968 --> 01:37:28.510]  I mean, it's already a great system.
[01:37:29.515 --> 01:37:32.337]  Um, and it's barely paying for itself.
[01:37:32.337 --> 01:37:39.682]  And I just, you hear me on the air with the sponsors and everything else trying to squeeze enough capital to fund this rebel operation against the New World Order.
[01:37:39.682 --> 01:37:42.744]  Most rebels in history robbed banks to fund themselves.
[01:37:42.744 --> 01:37:44.325]  We don't do that.
[01:37:44.325 --> 01:37:48.008]  And the COINTELPRO criticizes us for trying to raise the money to run this operation.
[01:37:48.008 --> 01:37:52.470]  And we're really victims of our own success.
[01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:53.031]  But, um,
[01:37:57.608 --> 01:38:01.852]  We will deliver this virally to everyone today.
[01:38:01.852 --> 01:38:05.195]  Matt, let's walk through this together, because I just had this idea.
[01:38:05.195 --> 01:38:07.438]  We were talking during the break about solutions.
[01:38:07.438 --> 01:38:12.823]  We don't have to make a new limited front page to get it.
[01:38:12.823 --> 01:38:19.289]  Can't we just pull off the members login page?
[01:38:20.370 --> 01:38:24.591]  I believe that's already on its own server, or at least I asked for it to be in the past.
[01:38:24.591 --> 01:38:43.117]  I don't understand all this architecture, but can't we just have a separate page just where people log in to watch it so even though PrisonPlanet.tv, the site goes down on InfoWars and Prison Planet for members, I can post up on the front page at 3 o'clock the login for members and then they can get into the back end and watch it.
[01:38:43.117 --> 01:38:45.077]  Is that not the workaround?
[01:38:45.077 --> 01:38:50.059]  Yeah, we can definitely provide a workaround where we can definitely get the content out there
[01:38:50.828 --> 01:38:56.151]  And then you were saying the other problem is it's so overwhelmed it's hard to get into it to make changes.
[01:38:56.151 --> 01:38:56.331]  Yeah.
[01:38:56.331 --> 01:38:58.332]  This is what happened with Sheen.
[01:38:58.332 --> 01:39:00.033]  Why don't you tell folks what happened that morning?
[01:39:09.178 --> 01:39:16.125]  Yeah, everybody was hunting around looking for, in the case of Charlie Sheen's document, looking around for that document.
[01:39:16.125 --> 01:39:18.907]  So we couldn't even get it uploaded and posted because they were on it.
[01:39:18.907 --> 01:39:19.228]  Correct.
[01:39:19.228 --> 01:39:24.493]  There's so many people searching the site, looking around for that extra additional traffic.
[01:39:25.188 --> 01:39:30.712]  That was generated by all that was causing us not to be able to get into the back end and upload it.
[01:39:30.712 --> 01:39:35.415]  Now, I had IT people, and you'd already said this, email me and say, well you just need to have your servers in-house.
[01:39:35.415 --> 01:39:40.598]  Yeah, that's easy if you're serving, you know, pictures of your baseball team out to ten people.
[01:39:40.598 --> 01:39:43.360]  It's different to have servers in-house because of the cost.
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:51.786]  We have to go to the giant server centers where it's cheap in Chicago, in Dallas, in England, in San Francisco, in Silicon Valley, but we are getting
[01:39:52.586 --> 01:39:56.047]  The Mega Fiber Optic Pipe in the next two weeks.
[01:39:56.047 --> 01:39:58.687]  Would that change this any?
[01:39:58.687 --> 01:40:03.468]  It would add another point of distribution.
[01:40:03.468 --> 01:40:07.309]  And it's all about making it decentralized because you never want to have a choke point.
[01:40:07.309 --> 01:40:10.310]  And that fiber is $3,000 a month, right?
[01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:11.830]  Yeah.
[01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:12.610]  Tell folks about this.
[01:40:12.610 --> 01:40:13.290]  This is a Mega Pipe.
[01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:14.410]  Tell them what it is.
[01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:17.111]  It's a fiber optic connection.
[01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:21.652]  Bandwidth is 65 megabits coming in that will allow us to
[01:40:22.332 --> 01:40:27.894]  Push data out, push out the new releases way quicker than we currently are.
[01:40:27.894 --> 01:40:35.037]  We can also start looking into some higher quality, super high definition streaming.
[01:40:35.037 --> 01:40:38.838]  Yeah, we've been studying it to go to actual high def.
[01:40:38.838 --> 01:40:45.821]  Yeah, definitely on the live streaming and all, that will allow us to get into that next phase where we can definitely get
[01:40:46.943 --> 01:40:49.245]  Get the word out, get it out there quickly.
[01:40:49.245 --> 01:40:56.330]  And just to be clear, we were a very small company, still tiny, when we moved out of our two, two and a half thousand square foot, roughly, we had two offices.
[01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:58.051]  We moved into this 8,000 square foot.
[01:40:58.051 --> 01:41:00.533]  We just expanded another 7,000 that I just leased.
[01:41:00.533 --> 01:41:07.058]  The city's not giving us permits, but we finally just went ahead and started without it, because you can do that except for the electrical.
[01:41:07.058 --> 01:41:09.260]  The point is, is that's what our growing pains have been.
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:12.482]  We appreciate everybody's support, just giving people kind of an inside view.
[01:41:13.263 --> 01:41:16.145]  Time Warner said they'd give us Time Warner cable when we came in here.
[01:41:16.145 --> 01:41:17.086]  Then they wouldn't.
[01:41:17.086 --> 01:41:19.648]  So we're going off DSL and T1.
[01:41:19.648 --> 01:41:21.529]  It's been hell.
[01:41:21.529 --> 01:41:28.174]  But we're going to this fiber optic thanks to your great work going through hell and earth and having meetings with all these big companies and having them actually running into us.
[01:41:28.174 --> 01:41:28.995]  That's now being done.
[01:41:28.995 --> 01:41:31.056]  So great job on that front.
[01:41:31.056 --> 01:41:33.918]  But I just want to make a decision.
[01:41:33.918 --> 01:41:35.940]  We're going to go with this at three o'clock.
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:39.623]  That'll give you guys two hours to do a workaround
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.081]  And it doesn't have to be anything fancy.
[01:41:42.081 --> 01:41:44.522]  I know Aaron was up here until three in the morning, so he won't be until later.
[01:41:44.522 --> 01:41:46.544]  We have a couple... Rob is out of town.
[01:41:46.544 --> 01:41:47.885]  Some other webmasters are gone.
[01:41:47.885 --> 01:41:49.486]  He went to visit family in New York.
[01:41:49.486 --> 01:42:09.038]  We need to go ahead and we can just have a basic page that says, uh, follow the Republic, members, click here, and then it just goes to the back end, and then we can just have it on players, there for them, on just a gray page, instead of it all being the big fancy, um, whatever system we have right now.
[01:42:09.038 --> 01:42:09.679]  What is it, Joombala?
[01:42:10.495 --> 01:42:11.155]  Joomla.
[01:42:11.155 --> 01:42:11.595]  Yeah.
[01:42:11.595 --> 01:42:12.975]  You want to go to Drupal?
[01:42:12.975 --> 01:42:14.736]  I'm a fan of Drupal.
[01:42:14.736 --> 01:42:15.956]  I'm trying to learn all this stuff.
[01:42:15.956 --> 01:42:20.477]  The point is, is that, uh, now the site's up and down, right?
[01:42:20.477 --> 01:42:24.177]  It's, it's acting very slow because of all the traffic that's hitting it.
[01:42:24.177 --> 01:42:32.759]  The site is, is staying up technically, but it's not just as responsive and forthcoming as before because of all the additional traffic.
[01:42:32.759 --> 01:42:34.479]  And you're having trouble even getting into it.
[01:42:34.479 --> 01:42:35.639]  Yeah.
[01:42:35.639 --> 01:42:39.420]  We're going to do this, um, alternative entry point.
[01:42:40.182 --> 01:42:47.501]  for the for the release so that we can have take the strain off the main site so we can uh... and it may be four five six o'clock now
[01:42:50.925 --> 01:42:55.706]  That's not what we're going to go for, but we're definitely going to go for 3 o'clock.
[01:42:55.706 --> 01:42:58.587]  Do we need to drive a mile down the road and get Aaron out of bed?
[01:42:58.587 --> 01:43:00.848]  That's why I've got to hire more people, but I'm also worried about infiltrators.
[01:43:00.848 --> 01:43:02.528]  I've got to hire two or three more webmasters.
[01:43:02.528 --> 01:43:04.109]  I've got the Watsons in England.
[01:43:04.109 --> 01:43:05.309]  I've got Kurt Nemo.
[01:43:05.309 --> 01:43:07.310]  Kurt Nemo could do stuff remotely, I guess.
[01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:09.551]  I don't know if he understands the PrisonPlanet.tv system.
[01:43:09.551 --> 01:43:10.631]  I guess Watson would be the guy.
[01:43:10.631 --> 01:43:13.112]  He's the guy that understands it the best.
[01:43:13.112 --> 01:43:14.512]  I'll get a hold of it.
[01:43:14.512 --> 01:43:17.533]  We'll definitely have a roundtable discussion on what
[01:43:17.884 --> 01:43:23.147]  And again, we had to have this discussion live on air, or I would have had to go off air to have the discussion we're having right now.
[01:43:23.147 --> 01:43:24.027]  Yeah.
[01:43:24.027 --> 01:43:27.149]  But I just... we had a three minute... I mean, was that your plan?
[01:43:27.149 --> 01:43:29.030]  Because I'm just throwing out my plan.
[01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:33.452]  Isn't the actual member interface different from the server we're talking about?
[01:43:34.502 --> 01:43:35.363]  Yes.
[01:43:35.363 --> 01:43:41.608]  But then we have the videos posted on the interface that is this server.
[01:43:41.608 --> 01:43:47.513]  Not streamed from that server, but the interface of the PrisonPlanet.tv that has the eye candy and looks good.
[01:43:47.513 --> 01:43:47.633]  Yeah.
[01:43:47.633 --> 01:43:48.894]  The problem is the eye candy.
[01:43:48.894 --> 01:43:52.658]  Yeah, pretty much it's that front end, it's the wrapper.
[01:43:52.658 --> 01:43:58.963]  You know, the candy is stored somewhere else, but the wrapper right now is what's... Better analogy, yes.
[01:43:58.963 --> 01:44:00.124]  Yeah.
[01:44:00.124 --> 01:44:02.126]  That's what's getting us right now is that wrapper.
[01:44:05.444 --> 01:44:08.986]  And how much will it cost me to get around this?
[01:44:08.986 --> 01:44:19.373]  I mean, in the future, so... It's a matter of architecting, more decentralized, more... Well, it's not you guys' fault.
[01:44:19.373 --> 01:44:22.775]  You guys are doing the job of 10 people, and we never had this problem before.
[01:44:24.289 --> 01:44:27.530]  But again, with just members, there's not that many members, this shouldn't be happening.
[01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:30.771]  I guess, because I saw the Internet ablaze last night and this morning, where is it?
[01:44:30.771 --> 01:44:31.191]  Where is it?
[01:44:31.191 --> 01:44:32.892]  So I guess everybody's looking for it for free.
[01:44:32.892 --> 01:44:35.393]  Here's the problem, guys, that want it for free.
[01:44:35.393 --> 01:44:40.094]  I basically end up giving the films out for free, but I have to put people on airplanes to fly to the interviews.
[01:44:40.094 --> 01:44:41.474]  I have to have the video editors.
[01:44:41.474 --> 01:44:42.855]  I have to have the software.
[01:44:42.855 --> 01:44:43.915]  I have to have the computers.
[01:44:43.915 --> 01:44:45.235]  I have to pay for the music.
[01:44:45.235 --> 01:44:46.356]  I have to pay for the composers.
[01:44:46.356 --> 01:44:48.016]  I have to pay for the sound engineers.
[01:44:48.016 --> 01:44:53.058]  I have to pay for the DVD authoring, replication, distribution, shipping, the shipping department.
[01:44:54.839 --> 01:45:02.548]  If I didn't let people pirate these and sell them and do all the stuff they do, our money problems would be over here.
[01:45:02.548 --> 01:45:06.412]  But then people also can bitch and complain and when I get up here with sponsors that fund everything.
[01:45:06.412 --> 01:45:07.453]  This is not free.
[01:45:07.453 --> 01:45:11.037]  We're not funded by George Soros, folks, who's attacking me in his publications every day.
[01:45:11.898 --> 01:45:14.020]  We're on the enemy's list because we're doing this on our own.
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:23.108]  I know most of you understand that, but some of the COINTELPRO always go in and just comment, comment, how dare Alex ask for money, how dare Alex try to fund things, how dare Alex do this, how dare Alex do that.
[01:45:23.108 --> 01:45:25.209]  What planet do they think we're living on?
[01:45:25.209 --> 01:45:28.892]  I mean, I'm even having trouble making the film and delivering it to you because of money.
[01:45:29.773 --> 01:45:39.401]  And then also, I have saved some money in reserves so we can defend ourselves from lawsuits if they ever happen, so we can continue to operate if the entire economy shuts down.
[01:45:39.401 --> 01:45:43.825]  I will sell everything I own and all of our reserves to fund this place.
[01:45:43.825 --> 01:45:49.270]  Literally, we've got big cases of ammo in our foxhole to fire through our howitzer, but we need your support.
[01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:50.111]  That's why we are
[01:45:51.326 --> 01:45:55.048]  One hour and 45 minutes in today, and I haven't plugged a single sponsor live on air.
[01:45:55.048 --> 01:45:58.010]  I haven't plugged the film to go buy it at Infowars.com.
[01:45:58.010 --> 01:45:58.870]  It's the very first.
[01:45:58.870 --> 01:46:00.811]  Please purchase the DVD.
[01:46:00.811 --> 01:46:02.072]  That's what's great about low-tech.
[01:46:02.072 --> 01:46:03.253]  It's the highest quality.
[01:46:03.253 --> 01:46:05.754]  You have the DVD, and you're supporting us.
[01:46:05.754 --> 01:46:06.755]  Go to Infowars.com.
[01:46:06.755 --> 01:46:08.936]  We've been shipping these things out for a couple days.
[01:46:08.936 --> 01:46:14.379]  A lot of people are going to be getting them anyways today, so we've got to hell or high water get this out to the members today.
[01:46:14.379 --> 01:46:17.881]  But I also want to thank the members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:46:17.881 --> 01:46:19.762]  You're the folks that actually fund what we're doing.
[01:46:20.242 --> 01:46:27.484]  You're putting major support into what we're doing, and we couldn't do this without you, the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[01:46:27.484 --> 01:46:34.306]  And for those that are long-time members, we've had it for more than five years now, five and a half years, since April, five years ago.
[01:46:34.306 --> 01:46:40.248]  You're who's made all this possible, and you've seen the site get better and better and quicker and quicker, and we're going to add so much.
[01:46:40.248 --> 01:46:47.890]  It's just, it's hard when you're small to build the next level, but we're almost done with the launch pad now for the next level of this operation.
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:49.981]  It's pretty exciting, isn't it?
[01:46:49.981 --> 01:46:50.682]  Oh yeah.
[01:46:50.682 --> 01:46:51.002]  Definitely.
[01:46:51.002 --> 01:46:53.064]  The foundation is being built.
[01:46:53.064 --> 01:47:02.251]  And it's, I mean, you want to do a constructionality, we're putting in big, thick pieces of rebar, we're getting the best concrete, you know, everything's being padded down.
[01:47:02.251 --> 01:47:10.639]  And the foundation for going ballistic is there.
[01:47:10.639 --> 01:47:11.720]  Going ballistic is right.
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:13.121]  To the moon without a rocket.
[01:47:13.121 --> 01:47:13.881]  Oh yeah.
[01:47:13.881 --> 01:47:14.122]  Oh yeah.
[01:47:15.325 --> 01:47:17.106]  As Ralph Kramden would say.
[01:47:17.106 --> 01:47:22.868]  Yeah, we're definitely, the foundation is getting there and we're going to the next level.
[01:47:22.868 --> 01:47:25.889]  Again, we've got to stay small because infiltration is a very real problem.
[01:47:25.889 --> 01:47:27.289]  Not that we're doing anything wrong here.
[01:47:27.289 --> 01:47:31.211]  People will come in here and try to commit crimes to put me in prison.
[01:47:31.211 --> 01:47:36.053]  We've already dealt with this.
[01:47:36.053 --> 01:47:38.673]  Just a very, very serious situation.
[01:47:38.673 --> 01:47:39.874]  I hear my iPhone going off.
[01:47:41.514 --> 01:47:43.895]  Well, pointless to babble about that.
[01:47:43.895 --> 01:47:44.495]  Thank you, Matt.
[01:47:44.495 --> 01:47:47.536]  Listen, we're going to go ahead and try to launch at three.
[01:47:47.536 --> 01:47:51.337]  Give yourself some space if you need to.
[01:47:51.337 --> 01:47:56.098]  All the other films we released a day early to kind of sneak attack the enemy, because we have been hit with hack attacks.
[01:47:56.098 --> 01:48:07.161]  I know we're not the type of website and operation that when we have a mistake or a problem or a bunch of traffic that, come on back in, Matt, that we blame things
[01:48:12.252 --> 01:48:18.757]  on hackers but we've had real hackers going and take over the front page and post a naked woman on a motorcycle before.
[01:48:18.757 --> 01:48:21.920]  We've had people send out other types of attacks in our name.
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:24.622]  We have had the Ports attack when I was doing the flu story.
[01:48:24.622 --> 01:48:28.686]  That was definitely a certified attack going through.
[01:48:28.686 --> 01:48:31.528]  Explain what that attack was like?
[01:48:31.528 --> 01:48:35.872]  Yeah, that was basically a large denial of service attack that occurred.
[01:48:39.755 --> 01:48:44.161]  That was just bombarding us with all facets of the world.
[01:48:44.161 --> 01:48:46.645]  We're sending out these requests to hit our servers.
[01:48:46.645 --> 01:48:52.433]  But more than that, you guys were telling me that they actually went around our main ports and found secret ports.
[01:48:53.322 --> 01:48:58.627]  They were just, yeah, they were, we have things that are listening or, you know, we don't have a lot.
[01:48:58.627 --> 01:49:01.310]  And then we would flip a port and they'd flip to that within minutes.
[01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:02.170]  Yeah.
[01:49:02.170 --> 01:49:05.193]  They were basically, uh, the, the term is like port scanning.
[01:49:05.193 --> 01:49:08.677]  So as soon as we moved a port around, they would hit us on that a port.
[01:49:08.677 --> 01:49:11.299]  So it was basically move.
[01:49:11.299 --> 01:49:18.306]  Do you think we're going to find because of the size of this being so big that it's interest or could it be an attack?
[01:49:18.306 --> 01:49:18.526]  I would,
[01:49:19.522 --> 01:49:24.769]  I would say most of it's going to be interest, but we'll have to take a look at all the data.
[01:49:24.769 --> 01:49:26.531]  But last time it was definitely an attack.
[01:49:26.531 --> 01:49:33.259]  Yeah, because of just the wide variety of where it was coming from and just the repeated nature of
[01:49:34.131 --> 01:49:34.331]  Yeah.
[01:49:54.116 --> 01:49:55.960]  A lot of it, most of it was overseas.
[01:50:06.869 --> 01:50:16.377]  I don't know how stupid the establishment is if this turns out to be an attack, and we'll do a forensic analysis on it and find out later.
[01:50:16.377 --> 01:50:18.318]  Because, you know, here I am in roll call.
[01:50:18.318 --> 01:50:19.859]  We are on the White House enemies list.
[01:50:19.859 --> 01:50:23.903]  It's not just coming out of the Globe and Mail now.
[01:50:23.903 --> 01:50:26.745]  I mean, we are now on the enemies list, and they are pissed.
[01:50:26.745 --> 01:50:31.209]  I mean, all these big mainstream publications are saying the establishment is afraid of these films.
[01:50:31.209 --> 01:50:34.891]  And, I mean, you jackasses ought to know you're not going to stop this film coming out if that's what this is.
[01:50:35.814 --> 01:50:37.416]  No, there's ways of getting around.
[01:50:37.416 --> 01:50:42.201]  We've got it ready to drop free on the web at five different places right now, just so you know.
[01:50:42.201 --> 01:50:42.421]  Yeah.
[01:50:42.421 --> 01:50:45.144]  We were ready three weeks ago with that.
[01:50:45.144 --> 01:50:47.467]  So you won't stop us.
[01:50:47.467 --> 01:50:56.757]  Yeah, the government, they may be as slick in some terms as far as the shininess of their badges, but when it comes to the brain power, you know, the
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:00.663]  The power of the resistance is way more powerful than the establishment.
[01:51:00.663 --> 01:51:01.143]  Absolutely.
[01:51:18.957 --> 01:51:19.318]  We're good to go!

[01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:06.415]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:06.415 --> 01:52:09.660]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:11.062]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:11.784 --> 01:52:14.927]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:14.927 --> 01:52:20.852]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:20.852 --> 01:52:26.396]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:26.396 --> 01:52:36.024]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:36.144 --> 01:52:38.485]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:38.485 --> 01:52:40.066]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:40.066 --> 01:52:42.528]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:42.528 --> 01:52:44.649]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:44.649 --> 01:52:49.811]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:54:35.508 --> 01:54:42.497]  I got him working on building a little backup page for PrisonPlanet.tv members to try to get this to you at the end of the show today.
[01:54:42.497 --> 01:54:44.800]  Regardless, it's going to be up on PrisonPlanet.tv tonight.

[01:55:04.423 --> 01:55:06.563]  They cannot stop you if you take action.
[01:55:06.563 --> 01:55:07.503]  Kevin in Oklahoma.
[01:55:07.503 --> 01:55:08.083]  You're on the air.
[01:55:08.083 --> 01:55:09.784]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:09.784 --> 01:55:11.144]  Good to finally talk to you.
[01:55:11.144 --> 01:55:15.705]  I'm a present Planet TV member and a fellow recent listener, I should say.
[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:19.721]  Wanted to call and thank you for doing all you're doing.
[01:55:19.721 --> 01:55:26.422]  Recently with all this H1N1 stuff, I was just like the zombies out there that didn't know anything about it.
[01:55:26.422 --> 01:55:30.784]  Work in a hospital and they were distributing it and I simply refused.
[01:55:30.784 --> 01:55:37.265]  And what's shocking to me is that other people around me didn't know why I was refusing the shot.
[01:55:37.265 --> 01:55:41.746]  And I told them, do you even really know what's in this vaccine?
[01:55:41.746 --> 01:55:44.647]  And they, you know, and it's just alarming.
[01:55:45.825 --> 01:55:46.546]  I work in the pharmacy.
[01:55:58.251 --> 01:56:04.414]  And the pharmacists all around me were, yeah, they just looked at me like I was zombified.
[01:56:04.414 --> 01:56:11.136]  But then meanwhile, the polls are reporting that in England over 70%, over 60% in the US are refusing it.
[01:56:11.136 --> 01:56:19.340]  So, 60% of us are kooks, over 90% in major polls believe the government killed Kennedy, and more evidence comes out every day that they did.
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:22.522]  And it's now been confirmed he did work for the CIA.
[01:56:22.522 --> 01:56:23.563]  That's mainstream news.
[01:56:23.563 --> 01:56:25.124]  Lee Harvey Oswald.
[01:56:25.124 --> 01:56:27.206]  But still, 92% of us are kooked.
[01:56:27.206 --> 01:56:28.947]  But the 8%, they're normal.
[01:56:28.947 --> 01:56:29.948]  And we're all nuts.
[01:56:29.948 --> 01:56:32.290]  And if you talk about a world government, you're a nut.
[01:56:32.290 --> 01:56:34.191]  As the news announces world government.
[01:56:34.191 --> 01:56:36.133]  I mean, it just doesn't work anymore.
[01:56:36.133 --> 01:56:37.274]  It really hit me last night.
[01:56:39.585 --> 01:56:48.970]  It really hit me between the eyes, just how crazy it is they put fluoride and hundreds of other toxic chemicals in the water under the name fluoride, knowing it hurts us.
[01:56:48.970 --> 01:56:52.131]  Hardly anybody wants it, but they still do it.
[01:56:52.131 --> 01:56:53.212]  They just don't care.
[01:56:53.212 --> 01:56:54.432]  They're criminals!
[01:56:54.432 --> 01:56:57.514]  And the bigger question is, why are we putting up with this crap?
[01:56:58.274 --> 01:56:58.754]  Why?
[01:56:58.754 --> 01:57:00.135]  Get it out of our water!
[01:57:00.135 --> 01:57:06.779]  Why do I have to filter everything and go through hell here in Austin, and still my kids take showers in your fluoride water even though I got some filters?
[01:57:06.779 --> 01:57:08.060]  They don't cut it all out!
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:10.161]  Just get it out of my water!
[01:57:10.161 --> 01:57:13.503]  Stop forcibly medicating me, you bastards!
[01:57:13.503 --> 01:57:15.224]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:57:15.224 --> 01:57:21.948]  Oh no, I just... It's alarming to see, and my mother, I got a call from her yesterday, and she's so sweet and so nice, but
[01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:25.461]  She's under the influence of the mainstream media.
[01:57:25.461 --> 01:57:43.510]  She called me, and I didn't see the segment, but she was talking to me about a Sunday segment that 60 Minutes had about this fear-mongering of this H1N1, and I was born with bronchial asthma, and she calls me and she goes, Kevin, I really want you to get this because you have asthma and you're very fragile.
[01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:45.070]  I was like, Mother, no.
[01:57:45.070 --> 01:57:49.532]  I do not know what's in it, and they will not publish what exactly is in it.
[01:57:49.532 --> 01:57:50.613]  And I just cannot believe
[01:57:51.246 --> 01:57:55.668]  The stranglehold that they have on the people around me and not myself.
[01:57:55.668 --> 01:57:58.929]  Are you a pharmacist or a pharmacist assistant?
[01:57:58.929 --> 01:58:01.210]  I'm a tech, which is a pharmacist assistant.
[01:58:01.210 --> 01:58:02.751]  You're a tech.
[01:58:02.751 --> 01:58:11.435]  I mean, on the inserts, and they do have some proprietary things that they, you know, just list as enderleukins and things, but it admittedly has the adjuvant mercury in it.
[01:58:11.435 --> 01:58:12.455]  That's admitted.
[01:58:12.455 --> 01:58:15.517]  It admittedly says it can give you Guillain-Barré on the insert.
[01:58:15.517 --> 01:58:16.797]  It admittedly says all of that.
[01:58:16.797 --> 01:58:18.278]  I mean, do the pharmacists not care?
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:22.521]  It just seemed, it seems like it.
[01:58:22.521 --> 01:58:24.282]  They had a handout that they gave.
[01:58:24.282 --> 01:58:26.682]  They had a stack of the handouts about the benefits and all that.
[01:58:26.682 --> 01:58:29.983]  It seemed like a general just listing of the shot.
[01:58:29.983 --> 01:58:36.305]  And I've seen the boxes themselves of the actual flu vaccine, that flu mist stuff.
[01:58:36.305 --> 01:58:36.805]  Stay there.
[01:58:36.805 --> 01:58:37.686]  Back in one minute.
[01:58:37.686 --> 01:58:42.667]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:42.667 --> 01:58:44.068]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.068 --> 01:58:47.009]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.814 --> 01:58:55.357]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.357 --> 01:58:56.278]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.278 --> 01:58:59.701]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.701 --> 01:59:00.561]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.561 --> 01:59:05.445]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.445 --> 01:59:06.205]  It's true.
[01:59:06.205 --> 01:59:11.069]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.069 --> 01:59:11.890]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:15.472]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.472 --> 01:59:19.175]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.375 --> 01:59:20.176]  Number four.
[01:59:20.176 --> 01:59:22.937]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.937 --> 01:59:26.620]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:27.400]  Number five.
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:31.563]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.563 --> 01:59:36.607]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.607 --> 01:59:40.789]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.789 --> 01:59:42.571]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.571 --> 01:59:47.174]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:59:47.534 --> 02:00:07.866]  877-327-0365 Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network Big Brother Mainstream Media
[02:00:08.659 --> 02:00:10.400]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.981]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.981 --> 02:00:13.543]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.543 --> 02:00:17.745]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.745 --> 02:00:23.990]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:29.674]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting the radio show in T-minus seven minutes.
[02:00:31.561 --> 02:00:33.082]  A ton of news to cover.
[02:00:33.082 --> 02:00:34.684]  Your phone calls.
[02:00:34.684 --> 02:00:37.527]  Kevin, I have the Mayo Clinic.
[02:00:37.527 --> 02:00:39.569]  You're a pharmacy tech.
[02:00:39.569 --> 02:00:41.410]  I have the Mayo Clinic.
[02:00:42.373 --> 02:00:48.777]  Insert with the live nasal delivery flu vaccine as it's technically named.
[02:00:48.777 --> 02:00:58.902]  And it says may cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, may cause cancer, may cause infertility, it may mutate in the nasal cavity and spread live virus.
[02:00:58.902 --> 02:01:06.787]  And I was watching Fox News yesterday morning and they were showing shots of flu vaccine and it said live virus on the side of the box.
[02:01:06.787 --> 02:01:09.969]  But you got cut off by the break when you were talking about the insert.
[02:01:09.969 --> 02:01:10.309]  Go ahead.
[02:01:11.226 --> 02:01:19.389]  Well, the insert itself, I mean, you and I, and the other viewers, I think, the information is truly out there if people want to look at it.
[02:01:19.389 --> 02:01:33.274]  The main point is that when I looked in the box insert and also the page, the 8x11 page that the hospital gave listing all the benefits, they did not list every single ingredient, you know, every adjuvant and all that.
[02:01:33.274 --> 02:01:37.516]  They listed the live virus that is in the vaccine.
[02:01:37.516 --> 02:01:40.497]  I thought that was very alarming that they didn't
[02:01:41.070 --> 02:01:43.031]  Well, I mean, it just depends.
[02:01:43.031 --> 02:01:53.055]  It makes you wonder, because, you know, I've done my own research, you know, with the help of, you know, the work you do and various other websites, and I'm just kind of taken back by this, because there's
[02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:07.871]  Officially, there's not, you know, they're not listing.
[02:02:07.871 --> 02:02:16.878]  Well, have you shown the pharmacist all the German and British news where the government officials won't take it and take their own vaccine that doesn't have all the additives?
[02:02:16.878 --> 02:02:20.761]  I have not had a chance to, not as of yet.
[02:02:20.761 --> 02:02:24.944]  That's their Spiegel, BBC, you name it, London Guardian.
[02:02:24.944 --> 02:02:27.366]  Give that to them and then see what they say.
[02:02:27.366 --> 02:02:32.630]  Yeah, and it's a tragedy, however, because most of them have already taken it.
[02:02:32.630 --> 02:02:34.612]  And, you know, I just want to let them know
[02:02:35.618 --> 02:02:39.522]  What exactly, you know, is all in this stuff?
[02:02:39.522 --> 02:02:41.965]  It's quite alarming.
[02:02:41.965 --> 02:02:42.565]  Unbelievable.
[02:02:42.565 --> 02:02:43.607]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:43.607 --> 02:02:44.367]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:44.367 --> 02:02:46.470]  There's all sorts of bad reactions.
[02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:54.498]  People getting paralyzed, people getting sick, people going into convulsions from the vaccine, and medical doctors are on record saying it is happening.
[02:02:54.498 --> 02:02:56.160]  Shirley in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:57.001]  Thanks for holding, Shirley.
[02:02:58.063 --> 02:02:59.404]  Hi Alex.
[02:02:59.404 --> 02:03:00.484]  Hi.
[02:03:00.484 --> 02:03:01.965]  I'm calling from Miami.
[02:03:01.965 --> 02:03:03.366]  I have a question for you.
[02:03:03.366 --> 02:03:18.054]  It's regarding the swine flu vaccination because they've sent the packets home to the parents basically asking us are we going to consent to let our children have the swine flu.
[02:03:18.054 --> 02:03:23.978]  There's a lot of parents that are hesitating to do it because they don't really know what's in the vaccine.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:27.462]  Do you have any referral websites?
[02:03:55.220 --> 02:04:16.835]  We have we have covered it all but but but yes it's all in the flu section on Infowars.com but Kurt puts the banner up there and then takes it down moves it around there's so much going up on the site but I would just google the term h1n1 flu vaccine insert
[02:04:20.522 --> 02:04:22.683]  And they're scanned in all over the web.
[02:04:22.683 --> 02:04:24.983]  There are hundreds of sites that have it.
[02:04:24.983 --> 02:04:26.924]  But during a break, I can go reprint them.
[02:04:26.924 --> 02:04:30.405]  I clean my desk off every few days, and it's out there in the big stacks.
[02:04:30.405 --> 02:04:34.886]  There's a table out there, a huge table, just for the last months of news, all stacked on it.
[02:04:34.886 --> 02:04:45.289]  Again, I'm so busy at the guns, firing on the enemy in the Info War, that it's... We need, like, a librarian or something, an archivist around here, so I can say, give me this, give me that, but then that takes money.
[02:04:45.289 --> 02:04:46.469]  But anything else, ma'am?
[02:04:47.165 --> 02:04:51.548]  Yes, I have one more question regarding something that the pastor was saying yesterday.
[02:04:52.136 --> 02:04:57.819]  Regarding, um, he said within two years' time, we'll all be working for the government.
[02:04:57.819 --> 02:05:00.221]  I wanted to know, how does that, do you think that ties in?
[02:05:00.221 --> 02:05:00.601]  Stay there!
[02:05:00.601 --> 02:05:00.981]  Stay there!
[02:05:00.981 --> 02:05:08.626]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author, Robert Beatles, wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:05:08.626 --> 02:05:14.709]  You can buy it at hereswhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks, or the book for ten bucks.
[02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:17.371]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:05:17.651 --> 02:05:23.937]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:05:23.937 --> 02:05:28.001]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:05:28.001 --> 02:05:33.387]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:05:33.627 --> 02:05:35.709]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:05:35.709 --> 02:05:37.451]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:05:37.451 --> 02:05:39.993]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:05:39.993 --> 02:05:44.717]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:05:44.717 --> 02:05:48.421]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:05:48.421 --> 02:05:51.544]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:05:51.544 --> 02:05:53.445]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:05:53.445 --> 02:05:55.547]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:01.781 --> 02:06:05.805]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:05.805 --> 02:06:09.048]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.048 --> 02:06:13.872]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:06:13.872 --> 02:06:20.258]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.258 --> 02:06:22.481]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.021 --> 02:06:23.321]  Tim Geithner?
[02:06:23.321 --> 02:06:23.842]  Bernanke?
[02:06:23.842 --> 02:06:24.622]  They're arsonists!
[02:06:24.622 --> 02:06:25.783]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:25.783 --> 02:06:28.024]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:41.914 --> 02:06:44.057]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:06:44.057 --> 02:06:49.204]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:06:49.204 --> 02:06:58.315]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:01.001 --> 02:07:04.004]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.004 --> 02:07:09.328]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.328 --> 02:07:11.390]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:16.395]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:17.576]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.576 --> 02:07:18.697]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.697 --> 02:07:20.579]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.579 --> 02:07:21.660]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:23.861]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.861 --> 02:07:25.203]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.203 --> 02:07:26.504]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.704 --> 02:07:31.968]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:31.968 --> 02:07:35.570]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.570 --> 02:07:39.373]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.373 --> 02:07:40.614]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.614 --> 02:07:41.515]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.515 --> 02:07:42.616]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.616 --> 02:07:43.356]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.356 --> 02:07:44.357]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.637 --> 02:07:47.679]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.679 --> 02:07:49.460]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:50.381]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:05.876 --> 02:08:10.718]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.718 --> 02:08:12.299]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.299 --> 02:08:13.199]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.199 --> 02:08:18.041]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.041 --> 02:08:22.083]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:31.522 --> 02:08:39.609]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv in living color.
[02:08:39.609 --> 02:08:42.131]  We were just talking to Sherry in Florida.
[02:08:42.131 --> 02:08:43.372]  She's got a second question.
[02:08:43.372 --> 02:08:46.054]  We're going to go back to her in just a moment.
[02:08:46.054 --> 02:08:50.098]  She was asking me where she could find the vaccine inserts.
[02:08:51.459 --> 02:09:20.167]  Now we've posted these repeatedly on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, the Mayo Clinic's own insert admitting the nasal live virus can spread, can breed, can mutate the nasal delivery of the vaccine, admitting that there is mercury in the injectable vaccine, that it can also cause Guillain-Barré, that it can cause neurological disorders, that it can cause convulsions, that it can trigger
[02:09:21.267 --> 02:09:36.139]  Infertility, cancer, and there's five different major injectable vaccines, several nasal vaccines, and all the inserts are basically the same, but we searched the term, Craig did, out there.
[02:09:36.139 --> 02:09:40.482]  He searched the term H1N1 package insert.
[02:09:40.482 --> 02:09:42.564]  H1N1 package insert.
[02:09:42.564 --> 02:09:46.687]  During that three minute break, we pulled this up.
[02:09:46.687 --> 02:09:49.970]  Gotta check the wiring on the document cam, it's been blinking like that for a while.
[02:09:51.198 --> 02:09:53.560]  But here it is.
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:10:01.167]  You can zoom in right here where it says, Dosage, Forms, and Strengths.
[02:10:01.167 --> 02:10:07.712]  And it says that the 5-ML contains the Marisol, a mercury derivative, added as a preservative.
[02:10:07.712 --> 02:10:09.594]  It's also an adjuvant.
[02:10:09.594 --> 02:10:10.955]  Causes an autoimmune response.
[02:10:10.955 --> 02:10:13.737]  0.5-ML does contains 25-MCG mercury.
[02:10:13.737 --> 02:10:13.838]  Okay?
[02:10:13.838 --> 02:10:14.098]  Mercury.
[02:10:19.670 --> 02:10:34.122]  The most deadly known heavy metal for the electrochemical processes in the brain according to the brain surgeons and scientists and biologists and scientists that we've had on this radio show.
[02:10:34.122 --> 02:10:35.403]  There it is.
[02:10:35.403 --> 02:10:39.406]  I see mainstream news articles saying there's no mercury in it and it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:10:39.406 --> 02:10:41.848]  They lie to you.
[02:10:41.848 --> 02:10:43.729]  Now do not believe me.
[02:10:43.729 --> 02:10:45.050]  Do not believe Alex Jones.
[02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:46.992]  You need to train yourself to check into things.
[02:10:48.536 --> 02:10:50.298]  Go to the Mayo Clinic online.
[02:10:50.298 --> 02:10:59.811]  Pull up the adverse reaction insert page online that doctors use for the nasal flu.
[02:10:59.811 --> 02:11:04.857]  Both H1N1 and seasonal and the H1N1 injectable.
[02:11:04.857 --> 02:11:05.178]  Read it!
[02:11:06.525 --> 02:11:15.152]  Go to Walgreens or Vons or Savon or Eckerds or to the Walmart Pharmacy and say hi to the pharmacist.
[02:11:15.152 --> 02:11:17.373]  Can I have the adverse reaction insert?
[02:11:17.373 --> 02:11:24.098]  Because if you eat eggs, excuse me, have a egg, when you eat eggs, if you have an allergic response, you're not supposed to take these.
[02:11:24.098 --> 02:11:25.920]  So you say, oh, I want to check for my allergies.
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:26.961]  May I see the insert?
[02:11:27.461 --> 02:11:31.584]  And if they give you a printed out cover sheet, this is part of scientific fraud.
[02:11:31.584 --> 02:11:34.287]  Most of them aren't consciously involved in it.
[02:11:34.287 --> 02:11:40.792]  They're just told by the big companies, oh, give them this simple printout.
[02:11:40.792 --> 02:11:42.714]  And it won't say all this.
[02:11:42.714 --> 02:11:50.921]  It's a printout from the company or the corporation about how great it is for you and how there's no adverse reactions and how you need it.
[02:11:50.921 --> 02:11:52.342]  Say, oh no, I don't want that.
[02:11:54.042 --> 02:11:57.844]  I need the actual insert from the package.
[02:11:57.844 --> 02:11:59.305]  And they'll go, sure.
[02:11:59.305 --> 02:12:01.406]  And every package they've got has it.
[02:12:01.406 --> 02:12:03.207]  Guaranteed the trash can's full of them.
[02:12:03.207 --> 02:12:05.728]  They've been injecting people all day and throwing it away.
[02:12:05.728 --> 02:12:09.170]  And they'll come over with a little folded up paper and go, here you go!
[02:12:09.170 --> 02:12:11.711]  Be a little white paper folded up about like that.
[02:12:11.711 --> 02:12:13.312]  You'll unfold it.
[02:12:13.312 --> 02:12:15.773]  It'll be full size, fine print.
[02:12:15.773 --> 02:12:18.074]  And boy, you can just read for yourself.
[02:12:18.074 --> 02:12:19.495]  Don't you believe me!
[02:12:19.495 --> 02:12:22.877]  Do not believe Alex Jones!
[02:12:24.349 --> 02:12:27.412]  I want you to read where it says it's got mercury in it.
[02:12:27.412 --> 02:12:39.704]  I want you to read where it can give you Guillain-Barré or other neurological disorders or kill you or cancer or sterilize you or make you somewhat infertile.
[02:12:39.704 --> 02:12:41.987]  I want you to go.
[02:12:44.051 --> 02:12:46.493]  Not even Infowars.com and print these off.
[02:12:46.493 --> 02:12:47.974]  Do not believe it.
[02:12:47.974 --> 02:12:54.198]  I want you to march into Walgreens and I want them from behind the counter to hand it right into your hand.
[02:12:54.198 --> 02:13:08.728]  And you're going to open it up, and then when you see the news saying there's no mercury in there, or there's no Guillain-Barré, or there's no neurological problems, or there's no links to cancer and infertility, you will hold in your hand from the drug package the truth.
[02:13:08.728 --> 02:13:11.750]  Because you tell your neighbor you got it from Infowars, they'll say,
[02:13:13.354 --> 02:13:14.535]  I read he's a cuckoo.
[02:13:14.535 --> 02:13:18.357]  They won't know it's George Soros publication, one of six, attacking me.
[02:13:18.357 --> 02:13:22.739]  They won't know it's a White House-funded, publicly-funded blogger group attacking.
[02:13:22.739 --> 02:13:25.380]  They're not going to believe me, and that's fine!
[02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:28.102]  They only believe the lying government.
[02:13:28.102 --> 02:13:32.484]  But you go, no, I got this from Walgreens, or I got this from Vons.
[02:13:32.484 --> 02:13:34.245]  I've got this from the company.
[02:13:36.479 --> 02:13:37.720]  And then you're going to have them.
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:40.523]  Now, a lot of them will say, you lie, that isn't real.
[02:13:40.523 --> 02:13:44.868]  And you get them by the arm, you go, okay, I bet you $1,000, just to prove it to them.
[02:13:44.868 --> 02:13:55.340]  Let's go down to the store together, and you take that moron, their life is worth it, you march them down there and have them give it to them, and then say, now, why is the media lying, saying none of this is in there and it can't do this to you?
[02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:59.942]  And then you may break somebody's conditioning right there.
[02:13:59.942 --> 02:14:06.626]  Let me tell the police, you trust the government that's given you all this power to violate our rights and telling you it's for our own good?
[02:14:06.626 --> 02:14:12.430]  Well, go find out that they know that squalene and mercury brain damaged the troops.
[02:14:12.430 --> 02:14:18.594]  The army in its own reports has confirmed they quit giving the anthrax shot with it because it was killing them and maiming them.
[02:14:20.782 --> 02:14:22.403]  The time for screwing around is over.
[02:14:22.403 --> 02:14:27.927]  Let's go back for a second question from Shirley, then we're going to go to Mike, Denise, Steve, and others.
[02:14:27.927 --> 02:14:30.468]  Go ahead, Shirley, what was your second question?
[02:14:30.468 --> 02:14:47.960]  Okay, my second question was yesterday when you had the pastor on, he was stating that the government, I mean, not the government, but the individual he was speaking with from the elite was informing him that within two years' time, a majority of everyone would be working for the government.
[02:14:48.812 --> 02:14:56.195]  Um, my question was, do you think that that is a way that they're going to try to manipulate everyone to get into the FEMA camps?
[02:14:56.195 --> 02:15:01.756]  Do you think they're going to try that in some way to make us think that we're going there to work, or?
[02:15:01.756 --> 02:15:04.357]  No, no, exactly.
[02:15:04.357 --> 02:15:12.180]  We understand their mindset and how they operate, but if you go back
[02:15:13.706 --> 02:15:17.069]  Years ago I said they're going to advertise the camps as work centers.
[02:15:17.069 --> 02:15:21.692]  They're going to advertise them as welfare centers to get your free health care.
[02:15:21.692 --> 02:15:27.177]  They're going to advertise Friday night that a country band or rock and roll band is going to come in.
[02:15:27.177 --> 02:15:31.240]  They're going to advertise, oh look, the army helps the local police now.
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:37.585]  Oh look, we're stopping drunk drivers and we're stopping bank robbers with OnStar kill switches in the cars.
[02:15:37.585 --> 02:15:38.405]  That's now happening.
[02:15:38.405 --> 02:15:38.625]  U.S.
[02:15:38.625 --> 02:15:39.726]  News and World Report today.
[02:15:39.726 --> 02:15:41.568]  In fact, we'll show people that article.
[02:15:42.554 --> 02:15:50.038]  They're going to advertise it all like it's a good thing and then just slowly but surely phase all this in.
[02:15:50.038 --> 02:15:58.964]  And when Lindsey talks about everybody working for the government, he means big select corporations will operate off of government bailouts and
[02:16:00.188 --> 02:16:04.330]  Government contracts, and the only part of the economy growing is the government.
[02:16:04.330 --> 02:16:11.134]  There'll be classic government jobs, the new enforcer jobs, the new enforcers on the farms, the ranches harassing people.
[02:16:11.134 --> 02:16:20.960]  I have mainstream articles all over the country, Homeland Security's funding the local police and others to set up checkpoints and harass people with their horses and their cows.
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:24.823]  They're moving around to sale or to another farm, another field.
[02:16:25.783 --> 02:16:32.027]  Checkpoints, any way to shut the highways down, train everybody to accept this.
[02:16:32.027 --> 02:16:34.268]  It's all happening.
[02:16:34.268 --> 02:16:35.509]  And so it's going to be incremental.
[02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:36.589]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:36.589 --> 02:16:40.412]  Until they stage a nuke attack or some big crisis and really drop the hammer.
[02:16:40.412 --> 02:16:42.913]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Minnesota.
[02:16:42.913 --> 02:16:44.234]  You're on the air, Mike.
[02:16:44.234 --> 02:16:47.536]  I salute you, General Jones.
[02:16:47.536 --> 02:16:48.436]  How are you doing?
[02:16:48.436 --> 02:16:50.157]  Pretty good.
[02:16:50.157 --> 02:16:51.278]  I got a question for you.
[02:16:53.402 --> 02:17:04.190]  You, uh, turned us on up here to the, uh, USS Boxer, and, uh, the people that died there, and I, in turn, turned them up here, the people up in Minnesota, to it.
[02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:05.892]  Nobody had heard about it up here.
[02:17:05.892 --> 02:17:10.015]  How come they took everything off the websites?
[02:17:10.015 --> 02:17:11.776]  What websites are you talking about?
[02:17:11.776 --> 02:17:14.519]  Well, yours, uh, my, you know, there are people up here asking.
[02:17:14.519 --> 02:17:17.861]  We've never heard anything about it, and, uh... But, I mean, wait a minute.
[02:17:17.861 --> 02:17:21.264]  We, we... Are you sure you just can't find it on my site?
[02:17:21.946 --> 02:17:30.252]  Well, I don't have a computer, but the guy I work... I call in and talk into a local radio talk show up here before your show, and they couldn't find it on your site.
[02:17:30.252 --> 02:17:32.634]  They pulled it, and he's a pretty good tech guy.
[02:17:32.634 --> 02:17:43.662]  Yeah, well, we very rarely, maybe every couple months, pull something, because I don't control all my webmasters and posters, and they've usually got a good feeling for what's real, what's accurate.
[02:17:44.901 --> 02:17:49.465]  And so I very rarely tell them to pull something that we've linked to or posted.
[02:17:49.465 --> 02:17:57.792]  More often than not, we'll post not a retraction, because it's not our article, but we'll post a clarification.
[02:17:57.792 --> 02:18:00.935]  I don't remember ever ordering something pulled.
[02:18:00.935 --> 02:18:07.260]  And so I have a sneaking suspicion the person doesn't remember the exact headline.
[02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:08.782]  We did not report
[02:18:10.114 --> 02:18:10.274]  That's
[02:18:25.954 --> 02:18:36.060]  Bob was saying, and he's a credible guy, I'm going from memory on this because I didn't really report on it much, other shows made a really big deal out of it, that there had been deaths and we were waiting to see what happened.
[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:39.281]  So you're asking me where it is or what's going on.
[02:18:39.281 --> 02:18:43.264]  I ignored it the first few days.
[02:18:43.264 --> 02:18:45.205]  People said, have you heard there's deaths on these ships?
[02:18:46.437 --> 02:18:50.942]  And I said, well, we did see deaths on other military bases with the last two swine flu outbreaks.
[02:18:50.942 --> 02:18:55.748]  That's where the government launches it in 76 and 1918.
[02:18:55.748 --> 02:18:57.911]  And so I said, that may be something to that.
[02:18:59.904 --> 02:19:10.127]  And then it came out in the news that there was a quarantine on some ships, so I'm not really the expert to be able to speak to that, because what I just told... There's the article.
[02:19:10.127 --> 02:19:11.668]  There's the article.
[02:19:11.668 --> 02:19:13.368]  It is on Infowars.com.
[02:19:13.368 --> 02:19:14.849]  It has not been removed.
[02:19:14.849 --> 02:19:17.009]  It's live at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:19:17.009 --> 02:19:21.711]  Bob Chapman talks about suspicious flu deaths on U.S.
[02:19:21.711 --> 02:19:22.431]  Navy ship.
[02:19:23.337 --> 02:19:24.738]  No, I don't have a computer.
[02:19:24.738 --> 02:19:25.818]  I'm off the grid.
[02:19:33.672 --> 02:19:34.833]  Okay, well, just punch it back up.
[02:19:34.833 --> 02:19:37.094]  I want to give that headline out three more times.
[02:19:37.094 --> 02:19:39.716]  Bob Chapman talks about suspicious flu deaths on U.S.
[02:19:39.716 --> 02:19:40.857]  Navy ships.
[02:19:40.857 --> 02:19:44.059]  Bob Chapman talks about suspicious flu deaths on U.S.
[02:19:44.059 --> 02:19:44.620]  Navy ships.
[02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:45.500]  One more time.
[02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:48.042]  Bob Chapman talks about suspicious flu deaths on U.S.
[02:19:48.042 --> 02:19:48.622]  Navy ships.
[02:19:48.622 --> 02:19:49.943]  We did not remove it.
[02:19:49.943 --> 02:19:51.605]  But, uh, interesting.
[02:19:51.605 --> 02:19:55.387]  We should talk to Bob when he's back on Friday and ask him for any updates on that.
[02:19:55.387 --> 02:19:56.228]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:19:56.228 --> 02:19:56.928]  Good to hear from you.
[02:19:56.928 --> 02:19:57.769]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.308 --> 02:20:04.869]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.

[02:20:44.054 --> 02:20:46.436]  The Heart and Body Extract is just so great.
[02:20:46.436 --> 02:20:51.220]  I thank God that I was led to this product that's doing so much for me, and that can do so much for other people.

[02:21:01.283 --> 02:21:03.465]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:03.465 --> 02:21:04.305]  Spy on me?
[02:21:04.305 --> 02:21:04.645]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.645 --> 02:21:09.689]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:09.689 --> 02:21:11.310]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:21:11.310 --> 02:21:12.051]  Startpage?
[02:21:12.051 --> 02:21:13.572]  Yeah, Startpage.com.
[02:21:13.572 --> 02:21:16.534]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:21:16.534 --> 02:21:20.417]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:21:20.417 --> 02:21:23.279]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:21:23.519 --> 02:21:26.160]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:27.741]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:21:27.741 --> 02:21:28.042]  Right!
[02:21:28.042 --> 02:21:31.363]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[02:21:31.363 --> 02:21:31.924]  Hello, folks.
[02:21:31.924 --> 02:21:33.284]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:21:33.284 --> 02:21:37.146]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[02:21:37.146 --> 02:21:40.929]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[02:22:01.755 --> 02:22:02.775]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:02.775 --> 02:22:08.317]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:08.317 --> 02:22:08.857]  I get it.
[02:22:08.857 --> 02:22:18.481]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:18.481 --> 02:22:19.641]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:19.881 --> 02:22:28.366]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:28.366 --> 02:22:31.748]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:31.748 --> 02:22:36.031]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:36.031 --> 02:22:37.631]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:37.631 --> 02:22:41.033]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:41.033 --> 02:22:45.176]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:45.376 --> 02:22:46.277]  You should too.
[02:22:46.277 --> 02:22:47.439]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:47.439 --> 02:22:50.363]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:22:50.363 --> 02:22:50.423]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.423 --> 02:22:50.503]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.503 --> 02:22:50.843]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.257 --> 02:23:06.460]  The following message is proudly and patriotically brought to you by the owners of Ready Reserve Foods, Inc.
[02:23:06.460 --> 02:23:11.864]  It is generally not the place for a business or corporation to make an editorial stand, but times have changed.
[02:23:11.864 --> 02:23:18.048]  It has become very obvious that our government is completely out of control and has decoupled from any constraints placed on it by the Constitution.
[02:23:18.408 --> 02:23:25.635]  It is also obvious that they are racing at breakneck speeds to place our once sovereign nation under the control of a global socialist government.
[02:23:25.635 --> 02:23:36.144]  These treasonous leaders, and we use the term treasonous because their actions and behavior can easily be regarded as treason, have over time systematically destroyed our culture, our industries, and now the U.S.
[02:23:36.144 --> 02:23:36.985]  dollar.
[02:23:36.985 --> 02:23:38.046]  This is our country.
[02:23:38.406 --> 02:23:38.807]  I think so.
[02:24:02.824 --> 02:24:06.306]  Suckin' on the blood of the children!
[02:24:30.151 --> 02:24:31.372]  Here it is!
[02:24:31.372 --> 02:24:36.214]  All the Republic, the DVD, shipping out en masse the last two days.
[02:24:36.214 --> 02:24:37.975]  We will be premiering at 3 p.m.
[02:24:37.975 --> 02:24:38.415]  today.
[02:24:38.415 --> 02:24:40.176]  Just got the word from the IT guys.
[02:24:40.176 --> 02:24:41.496]  They've got a workaround.
[02:24:41.496 --> 02:24:52.241]  They're creating on another server a simple splash page for members, where you enter your member code that you create, your member ID, and you are going to be able to watch it at 3 p.m.
[02:24:52.241 --> 02:24:54.702]  Central today, right when the show ends.
[02:24:54.702 --> 02:24:56.283]  Good job to the crew with that workaround.
[02:24:56.283 --> 02:24:58.124]  As for PrisonPlanet.tv itself,
[02:24:59.431 --> 02:25:02.634]  We better make a splash page for people, too.
[02:25:02.634 --> 02:25:08.098]  Not just a member login, can we, because that's on another server, can we have it where people can sign up?
[02:25:08.098 --> 02:25:08.959]  Because that's the key.
[02:25:08.959 --> 02:25:11.060]  A lot of people are wanting to sign up right now, too.
[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:17.345]  PrisonPlanet.tv itself is being hammered and is up and down and very, very slow for those that can get on it.
[02:25:17.345 --> 02:25:27.614]  We're not even able to stream live today, PrisonPlanet.tv, but it will be archived for everyone later this evening at PrisonPlanet.tv, the radio slash TV show.
[02:25:28.843 --> 02:25:34.385]  And Matt just said that for everybody today, because our problem isn't bandwidth, we have that.
[02:25:34.385 --> 02:25:38.266]  The problem is just the main server, just for the site itself.
[02:25:38.266 --> 02:25:42.328]  We're going to go ahead and offer the TV show today for free to everybody.
[02:25:42.328 --> 02:25:45.589]  For those that haven't gotten a chance to see what it looks like, that'll be up in the next 30 minutes.
[02:25:45.589 --> 02:25:53.592]  We'll put links on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for folks to tune in to the last hour or so of the TV show today.
[02:25:53.592 --> 02:25:56.213]  Also, so members can tune in and watch it live.
[02:25:58.180 --> 02:26:03.201]  But Fall of the Republic hits in 1 hour and 34 minutes exactly.
[02:26:03.201 --> 02:26:07.022]  1 hour and 34 minutes away from launch.
[02:26:07.022 --> 02:26:10.042]  Going back to calls, let's talk to Denise in Texas.
[02:26:10.042 --> 02:26:11.062]  You're on the air, Denise.
[02:26:11.062 --> 02:26:11.843]  Welcome.
[02:26:11.843 --> 02:26:12.363]  Hello!
[02:26:12.363 --> 02:26:14.083]  How you doing?
[02:26:14.083 --> 02:26:15.723]  Well, I'm pretty good.
[02:26:15.723 --> 02:26:17.384]  I'm sorry about your loss, by the way.
[02:26:17.384 --> 02:26:24.985]  Hey, Alex, you have said in the past that Hollywood movies are sometimes a heads up from the elite.
[02:26:26.229 --> 02:26:27.010]  Yes.
[02:26:27.010 --> 02:26:29.993]  Okay.
[02:26:29.993 --> 02:26:36.218]  I was listening to this crazy balloon boy thing, and I caught myself thinking, this is right out of 12 Monkeys.
[02:26:36.218 --> 02:26:40.722]  And then I realized what 12 Monkeys was really about.
[02:26:40.722 --> 02:26:46.167]  Eugenics, where they release a bioweapon that kills 99.9% of the world's population.
[02:26:46.167 --> 02:26:47.228]  Exactly.
[02:26:47.228 --> 02:26:50.271]  And I was wondering, could this be our heads up?
[02:26:51.488 --> 02:26:58.773]  Then I got to, you know, it's been a couple days and nothing has actually happened, so I got, guess what, maybe not.
[02:26:58.773 --> 02:27:03.757]  No, I think that was just a stunt by some people that were dying to have a TV show.
[02:27:03.757 --> 02:27:04.237]  Okay.
[02:27:04.237 --> 02:27:08.220]  Because you remember in that movie, the kid is hiding in the barn.
[02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:10.522]  In that movie.
[02:27:10.522 --> 02:27:19.268]  You remember, I don't know if you remember, Bruce Willis, they're, through the whole movie, they're digging out the kid that's in the well, and Bruce Willis keeps saying, the kid's in the barn.
[02:27:19.268 --> 02:27:20.629]  It's a hoax, it's a hoax.
[02:27:21.613 --> 02:27:23.595]  And so that's what got me.
[02:27:23.595 --> 02:27:33.563]  Well that was about how the media had a big distraction and how the establishment uses big distractions like that right before they launch something really big.
[02:27:33.563 --> 02:27:35.705]  But yes, I need to watch that film again.
[02:27:35.705 --> 02:27:44.312]  It is definitely... Also what happens in Hollywood, a lot of it's paid for, a lot of it's propaganda, a lot of it is New World Order.
[02:27:44.312 --> 02:27:45.974]  But then I happen to know some other directors
[02:27:47.876 --> 02:28:09.629]  Who put out films like A Scanner Darkly, and that has New World Order imagery in it on purpose, because I was one of the consultants on it, for Tommy Pallotta and Richard Linkletter, to throw New World Order in your face, that it's the New World Order getting everyone addicted to this drug that turns them into zombie slaves.
[02:28:09.629 --> 02:28:14.272]  And I announced it was going to have New World Order imagery, and people said, oh, we found hidden imagery in it.
[02:28:14.272 --> 02:28:15.933]  Yes, it's not hidden.
[02:28:15.933 --> 02:28:16.754]  It's in plain view.
[02:28:17.868 --> 02:28:28.218]  I've talked to other Hollywood people, but then Rick Linklater had to fight with the studio just to keep a scene in there where a cop executes a guy and shoots him in the head.
[02:28:28.218 --> 02:28:29.459]  They didn't even want that.
[02:28:29.459 --> 02:28:35.325]  What they saw is an anti-police message in there, and they cut a few little other scenes.
[02:28:35.325 --> 02:28:36.346]  Some of the stuff stayed in.
[02:28:36.346 --> 02:28:42.131]  So I've seen on the inside the directors and people trying to
[02:28:43.487 --> 02:28:49.394]  Trying to get their vision out that's good, while the establishment tries to stop that.
[02:28:49.394 --> 02:28:55.141]  So it's not 100% control, but under Obama, it's really starting to move towards that.
[02:28:55.141 --> 02:28:57.884]  Does that answer your question?
[02:28:57.884 --> 02:29:02.029]  Also, something real quick, something that I've been listening to you for a while, but
[02:29:03.311 --> 02:29:04.593]  I'm confused.
[02:29:04.593 --> 02:29:10.700]  And sometimes you tell me, when you say, well there's two different factions of the Illuminati, that makes some sense.
[02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:18.088]  But the people that Lindsey Williams is talking to, the guy, do you think he's one of these depopulationists?
[02:29:18.088 --> 02:29:19.530]  Because he never really talks about
[02:29:20.054 --> 02:29:29.796]  That he's talking about financial crashes and, you know, all that stuff, but he's not really talking about... Well, I mean, I think it's going to be a limited perspective only talking to one person, but it's an interesting window.
[02:29:29.796 --> 02:29:33.037]  And then also, there's what's that person holding back?
[02:29:33.037 --> 02:29:35.157]  What is that person really saying?
[02:29:35.157 --> 02:29:41.938]  You know, I don't think you can just take that one individual saying this and then make the whole world about that because the prediction was right.
[02:29:41.938 --> 02:29:44.759]  I think it's important, needs to be looked at.
[02:29:44.759 --> 02:29:48.020]  But there's two different factions, but it's like a man and woman who are in a marriage.
[02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:49.620]  They're still going for the same agenda.
[02:29:51.638 --> 02:29:55.589]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.589 --> 02:29:58.257]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.779 --> 02:30:10.887]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecolablue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[02:30:10.887 --> 02:30:12.489]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:30:12.489 --> 02:30:13.570]  It's very real.
[02:30:13.570 --> 02:30:13.930]  I know.
[02:30:13.930 --> 02:30:18.153]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:30:18.153 --> 02:30:21.376]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[02:30:21.376 --> 02:30:29.583]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecolablue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[02:30:30.023 --> 02:30:36.704]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[02:30:36.704 --> 02:30:45.406]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[02:30:45.406 --> 02:30:50.127]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[02:30:50.127 --> 02:30:50.347]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:30:50.347 --> 02:30:51.487]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web
[02:31:00.772 --> 02:31:06.097]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.097 --> 02:31:08.180]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:10.622]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.622 --> 02:31:12.905]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.905 --> 02:31:14.507]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.507 --> 02:31:15.568]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.788 --> 02:31:24.214]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:31:24.214 --> 02:31:31.659]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:31:31.659 --> 02:31:37.323]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:31:37.683 --> 02:31:43.708]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:31:43.708 --> 02:31:47.871]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[02:31:55.336 --> 02:31:58.639]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:32:00.785 --> 02:32:04.166]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:32:04.166 --> 02:32:07.787]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:32:07.787 --> 02:32:12.349]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:32:12.349 --> 02:32:17.951]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:32:18.251 --> 02:32:23.015]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:32:23.015 --> 02:32:26.638]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:32:26.638 --> 02:32:31.462]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:32:31.462 --> 02:32:38.028]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:32:38.028 --> 02:32:39.970]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:32:40.450 --> 02:32:44.531]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:33:10.572 --> 02:33:14.656]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:14.656 --> 02:33:27.206]  We got Webster Tarpley coming up for part of the next hour to talk about Jandala Al-Qaeda group attacking Iranian military bases, openly working for the people that have hijacked our nation.
[02:33:27.206 --> 02:33:33.091]  So when you say working for the US, the US is just a big demonic robot the New World Order controls.
[02:33:33.919 --> 02:33:38.801]  We'll be discussing that with him, Fall of the Republic that he features heavily in, and a lot more.
[02:33:38.801 --> 02:33:43.643]  Fall of the Republic will be premiering at PrisonPlanet.tv today at 3 p.m.
[02:33:43.643 --> 02:33:46.324]  Central Standard Time for all the great members over there.
[02:33:46.324 --> 02:33:48.125]  Got it on DivX, a bunch of other copies.
[02:33:48.125 --> 02:33:51.086]  You can burn it to disc, to CD, give it to everybody you know.
[02:33:52.313 --> 02:33:52.734]  All right.
[02:34:05.609 --> 02:34:12.274]  Fall of the Republic with the extras, the Oath Keepers 20-something minute extra, and Charlie Sheen's message to the President.
[02:34:12.274 --> 02:34:13.796]  That is all on the DVD.
[02:34:13.796 --> 02:34:16.438]  Order them at InfoWars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:34:16.438 --> 02:34:16.498]  888-253-3139.
[02:34:16.498 --> 02:34:19.100]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at P.O.
[02:34:19.100 --> 02:34:19.360]  Box 19549.
[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:19.801]  That's P.O.
[02:34:19.801 --> 02:34:20.962]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:34:20.962 --> 02:34:21.582]  The film is $19.95.
[02:34:33.832 --> 02:34:40.722]  And your purchase of the DVD documentary to have it in your library also makes future filmmaking possible.
[02:34:40.722 --> 02:34:42.605]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:34:42.605 --> 02:34:43.807]  I haven't plugged a sponsor yet.
[02:34:43.807 --> 02:34:44.688]  I'm going to do that right now.
[02:34:44.688 --> 02:34:48.313]  Then we're going to go to Paul Watson and more of your phone calls.
[02:34:49.403 --> 02:34:52.166]  I wanted to first tell you about Diginet.net.
[02:34:52.166 --> 02:34:55.428]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:34:55.428 --> 02:35:01.194]  Diginet.net has a wide range of high quality, extremely inexpensive.
[02:35:01.194 --> 02:35:02.815]  There's such a big distributor of these.
[02:35:02.815 --> 02:35:06.458]  It's the best price I've found anywhere for these high quality pens.
[02:35:06.458 --> 02:35:08.360]  They can record hours of video and audio.
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:10.962]  They put a time stamp on it so you can use it in court.
[02:35:10.962 --> 02:35:12.063]  You just press one button.
[02:35:12.063 --> 02:35:14.385]  It's the ease of access that's so key and it's hidden.
[02:35:15.746 --> 02:35:17.947]  It's disguised as a pen, camouflaged.
[02:35:17.947 --> 02:35:18.888]  Diginet.net.
[02:35:18.888 --> 02:35:25.631]  They have sunglasses that have a tiny camera built in with a little memory stick in them.
[02:35:25.631 --> 02:35:27.512]  Absolutely awesome as well.
[02:35:27.512 --> 02:35:28.393]  Diginet.net or 888-344-6681.
[02:35:28.393 --> 02:35:29.193]  Give them a call today.
[02:35:29.193 --> 02:35:29.253]  888-344-6681.
[02:35:29.253 --> 02:35:29.653]  Diginet.net.
[02:35:29.653 --> 02:35:31.754]  Everybody should fight Big Brother with Big Brother.
[02:35:40.333 --> 02:35:41.033]  It's very important
[02:36:02.202 --> 02:36:05.065]  Just a whole bunch of different great food lines and the best price out there.
[02:36:05.065 --> 02:36:07.768]  This is all recently packaged, meaning in the last month.
[02:36:07.768 --> 02:36:10.491]  It's not some 10 or 15 year old crap they're selling you.
[02:36:10.491 --> 02:36:12.573]  This is where I chose to get my storable foods.
[02:36:12.573 --> 02:36:20.621]  efoodsdirect.com, the letter E, then foodsdirect.com, big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com if you forget the address.
[02:36:20.621 --> 02:36:22.403]  They have free brochures you can call and get.
[02:36:22.403 --> 02:36:23.904]  They have videos you can watch on the site.
[02:36:24.810 --> 02:36:27.371]  Photos of their whole line, the different packages they have.
[02:36:27.371 --> 02:36:32.293]  Give them a call at 800-409-5633 if you'd like to get a free brochure or order that way.
[02:36:32.293 --> 02:36:35.154]  800-409-5633.
[02:36:35.154 --> 02:36:39.796]  They have three-day packages, seven-day packages, month packages, year packages, three-year packages.
[02:36:39.796 --> 02:36:42.577]  800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:36:42.577 --> 02:36:42.977]  Okay.
[02:36:42.977 --> 02:36:50.539]  I'm probably just going to end up having a tire play on about 30 minutes.
[02:36:50.539 --> 02:36:54.301]  I want to get his take on a couple different issues because I want to do a big news blitz at the end of the show.
[02:36:56.286 --> 02:37:00.187]  Also, going up in the next 10 minutes on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:37:00.187 --> 02:37:02.008]  Is that my ETA, Matt?
[02:37:02.008 --> 02:37:05.348]  That we're going to have the free stream for everybody in the next 10 minutes?
[02:37:05.348 --> 02:37:12.130]  We're going to go ahead and just stream the TV show for free for everybody today, up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:37:12.130 --> 02:37:13.891]  He's got about 20 minutes, so the start of the next hour.
[02:37:14.731 --> 02:37:21.273]  We've got to get Watson and Kurt, obviously, to post that as a link for everybody as well, because you can't really go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:37:21.273 --> 02:37:22.914]  It's crashing right now.
[02:37:22.914 --> 02:37:28.776]  But we have the video on separate member servers, so that's going to be available at the end of the show today, Fall of the Republic.
[02:37:28.776 --> 02:37:36.939]  But I wanted to get Watson on today, briefly, because he wrote a great report on al-Qaeda groups publicly working for the U.S.
[02:37:36.939 --> 02:37:39.880]  criminal government, the illegitimate government, attacking Iran.
[02:37:40.780 --> 02:37:42.261]  The hell Iran has gone through.
[02:37:42.261 --> 02:37:48.066]  It's just, I want Americans to know what the globalists are doing in our names, trying to get Iran to launch attacks.
[02:37:48.066 --> 02:37:55.552]  I also want, Paul's done some big reports on the flu fear-mongering that's going on, and a lot more, and Fall of the Republic.
[02:37:55.552 --> 02:37:59.355]  But Paul, let's get your take on Fall of the Republic first.
[02:37:59.355 --> 02:38:01.777]  You have seen the film, you've written reviews of the film.
[02:38:02.498 --> 02:38:04.119]  You and your brother have both written articles.
[02:38:04.119 --> 02:38:08.963]  I didn't ask you to, uh, to, uh, you know, what to say or do in the articles.
[02:38:08.963 --> 02:38:11.965]  This is your best review ever of any of my films.
[02:38:11.965 --> 02:38:15.768]  Briefly, give us your take on Fall of the Republic.
[02:38:15.768 --> 02:38:19.952]  Well, yeah, I watched it in full, uh, a few days ago.
[02:38:19.952 --> 02:38:26.177]  And basically, it's the most, um, high quality production of any film that I've ever seen.
[02:38:26.177 --> 02:38:30.500]  You put out, and bear in mind that I, you know, I was watching your films back in,
[02:38:31.563 --> 02:38:35.465]  Uh, before 2001 when I first got into all this.
[02:38:35.465 --> 02:38:46.209]  So the progression from those early films, America Destroyed by Design, um, Police State 2000, Police State 2, the progression is clear.
[02:38:46.209 --> 02:38:57.394]  And some of the graphics, some of the illustrations you use to, um, illustrate the points you make in Fall of the Republic is just such a high quality.
[02:38:58.559 --> 02:39:16.094]  And in the review that my brother wrote, which seems to be the one that spurred this massive bombardment of interest from what people are saying on the forum, which is good, I mean he compares it to something like Michael Moore's new film.
[02:39:16.094 --> 02:39:20.238]  Now the difference between us and Michael Moore is that we don't make
[02:39:21.188 --> 02:39:29.550]  20 million plus gross on every film we put out, so we don't have the kind of money that Michael Moore has to put into it.
[02:39:29.550 --> 02:39:36.112]  I'm just going off the numbers of his most recent films so far.
[02:39:36.112 --> 02:39:41.054]  But yeah, we don't have 300 million dollars to put into it.
[02:39:41.054 --> 02:39:42.374]  But in terms of
[02:39:43.257 --> 02:39:55.484]  It's hard-hitting nature and the absolutely vital preeminence of the information contained in Fall of the Republic, then, you know, it ranks above that.
[02:39:55.484 --> 02:39:59.626]  And the stuff on the cap-and-trade is the most important, the stuff on global warming.
[02:39:59.626 --> 02:40:09.832]  You've got Timothy Ball, PhD, on there talking about how climate skeptics are being derided and smeared as Holocaust deniers.
[02:40:09.832 --> 02:40:11.453]  We've got another story out on that today.
[02:40:12.659 --> 02:40:23.745]  All the stuff about Al Gore and his involvement in the carbon trading swindle, which he jointly owns with the Rothschild family, is just so damning and exposing.
[02:40:23.745 --> 02:40:28.347]  I mean, that's the key segment of the film for me.
[02:40:28.347 --> 02:40:30.709]  And it's just a tour de force, basically.
[02:40:30.709 --> 02:40:34.691]  It's nearly two and a half hours long, more than that with the extras.
[02:40:34.691 --> 02:40:35.911]  And it's a tour de force.
[02:40:37.944 --> 02:40:55.008]  Complimentary sequel to the Obama deception and as we've emphasized and pushed in all the review articles that we've put out we encourage people to get it and make copies and make copies on the internet and spread it to the four corners of the world because
[02:40:55.831 --> 02:41:06.102]  As you've said many times, the Obama deception has received tens of millions of views in total, and that's what's got the establishment freaking out, especially over the past six months.
[02:41:06.102 --> 02:41:17.974]  It's intensified because we're having a great effect of waking a lot of people up, and that's been reflected in the amount of people who are refusing this swine flu vaccine, which we'll get on to talk about.
[02:41:19.150 --> 02:41:29.776]  And the film covers who the bankers are, their master plan, how either we bring them to justice or they become the private heads and owners of the planetary government.
[02:41:29.776 --> 02:41:41.081]  We get into the entire latest developments in the police state grid, eugenics, TV mind control, and the main message is the world government's now here.
[02:41:41.081 --> 02:41:42.642]  It's now happening.
[02:41:42.642 --> 02:41:45.364]  This is our last chance to stand up against these people.
[02:41:46.266 --> 02:41:52.060]  They're moving in against us, they have a lot of power, but they're also weak as they reveal themselves.
[02:41:52.060 --> 02:41:53.824]  All the debates about world government...
[02:41:54.671 --> 02:41:58.133]  Existing or not existing are now over.
[02:41:58.133 --> 02:42:02.276]  This has their own words, their own documents, their own video clips, their own statements.
[02:42:02.276 --> 02:42:03.837]  It is shockingly well done.
[02:42:03.837 --> 02:42:09.180]  The whole crew did a fabulous job in putting this together.
[02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:19.406]  I'm the director and the writer, but the credit goes to everybody, and it's such a wonderful thing we've done here today, you know, together.
[02:42:19.406 --> 02:42:21.167]  All of this coming towards this day, October 21st, 2000.
[02:42:23.835 --> 02:42:51.229]  and nine and i just want to salute everybody that's been involved and i want to salute the viewers and listeners and supporters that i know we're destined to make this the most important film of this year one of the most devastating salvoes against the new world order the people get making the get ready to make the copies of the dvds everywhere as we ship them out the people that are going to spread the video links to the four corners the people that are going to put on the bit torrents the prison planet dot tv members will see it first in the highest quality who are
[02:42:52.430 --> 02:43:01.639]  The founders of what we're doing, the people that are right there beside us, they deserve as much credit as my entire crew because without them we couldn't do this.
[02:43:01.639 --> 02:43:04.561]  The way that people are out there getting the word out, spreading the word.
[02:43:04.561 --> 02:43:06.904]  Again, I couldn't thank you from the bottom of my heart more.
[02:43:06.904 --> 02:43:08.425]  This is such a great thing.
[02:43:08.425 --> 02:43:12.069]  We're brothers and sisters together, communally part of this event.
[02:43:13.502 --> 02:43:23.251]  And it's another stepping stone to show the world what individuals can do, what individual empowerment together with an idea, as they say in V for Vendetta.
[02:43:23.251 --> 02:43:28.035]  You know, flesh and blood can fail, but ideas, ideas are bulletproof.
[02:43:28.035 --> 02:43:30.297]  And they are bulletproof when they are the truth.
[02:43:30.297 --> 02:43:32.579]  So, everyone, start your engines.
[02:43:33.504 --> 02:43:34.785]  Get ready.
[02:43:34.785 --> 02:43:40.111]  We're going to be releasing Fall of the Republic in one hour and sixteen and a half minutes.
[02:43:40.111 --> 02:43:42.633]  One hour, sixteen and a half minutes.
[02:43:42.633 --> 02:43:44.415]  We will be releasing Fall of the Republic.
[02:43:45.765 --> 02:43:50.149]  You can download it on DivX version, burn it right to CD to give to people.
[02:43:50.149 --> 02:43:54.773]  It has a super high quality, the high quality, the medium quality, and then the decent quality.
[02:43:54.773 --> 02:43:57.295]  Our lowest quality looks a lot better than YouTube or Google.
[02:43:57.295 --> 02:43:59.397]  We have the DivX that came out better than ever.
[02:43:59.397 --> 02:44:03.420]  It's as good as the medium, or maybe even better, to burn to regular CD.
[02:44:04.381 --> 02:44:06.842]  I mean, this is so exciting.
[02:44:06.842 --> 02:44:09.383]  I want this to explode!
[02:44:09.383 --> 02:44:12.845]  I want people to get up to make copies and get them out on the streets instantly.
[02:44:12.845 --> 02:44:15.506]  I want to see them on the streets tomorrow.
[02:44:15.506 --> 02:44:18.768]  Let's take... I mean, we've seen the success of the Obama deception.
[02:44:18.768 --> 02:44:22.570]  We've seen the success of Endgame and Terror Storm and Road to Tyranny.
[02:44:22.570 --> 02:44:26.391]  That was all building towards this and this is building towards the next phase.
[02:44:26.391 --> 02:44:27.772]  It is so exciting.
[02:44:27.772 --> 02:44:31.574]  So get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:32.074 --> 02:44:33.654]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:44:33.654 --> 02:44:35.235]  You can click through there as well.
[02:44:35.235 --> 02:44:36.555]  We're calling it the DVD.
[02:44:36.555 --> 02:44:38.235]  I'm just so excited about it.
[02:44:38.235 --> 02:44:44.877]  Now, Paul, in the time we've got left, let's get into the flu situation, then into what's happening in Iran.
[02:44:44.877 --> 02:44:46.417]  Very serious situation.
[02:44:46.417 --> 02:44:48.298]  Trying to get that war going.
[02:44:48.298 --> 02:44:49.398]  The establishment is.
[02:44:49.398 --> 02:44:51.338]  Go ahead.
[02:44:51.338 --> 02:44:59.820]  Well, the situation with swine flu is that vast numbers of people all over the world have rejected it.
[02:45:00.461 --> 02:45:18.836]  Now remember, when this was first getting ready to be introduced in, you know, they first announced it a couple of months after the outbreak in around June, July, virtually all major Western governments and others said that it was going to be a, quote, mass vaccination campaign.
[02:45:19.645 --> 02:45:28.207]  Now if they weren't going to enforce it via mandatory injections, they were at least going to try and make as many people as possible take it.
[02:45:28.207 --> 02:45:29.927]  Most of the population.
[02:45:29.927 --> 02:45:35.769]  They've bought enough vaccines to cover the vast majority of the population, if not more.
[02:45:35.769 --> 02:45:45.611]  But what's happened is that, I mean, the people who were opposing it, who have now been labelled the anti-vaccine lobby, as if it's a lobby when
[02:45:46.229 --> 02:45:51.230]  The real pharmaceutical lobby spends over a hundred million dollars a year, every year.
[02:45:51.230 --> 02:45:53.451]  A hundred million?
[02:45:53.451 --> 02:45:57.712]  They spend, there's billions on vaccine ads alone, Paul, go ahead.
[02:45:57.712 --> 02:45:59.512]  I'm talking about the lobby in Washington.
[02:45:59.512 --> 02:46:02.553]  They've got twelve, at least twelve hundred lobbyists.
[02:46:02.553 --> 02:46:05.394]  Oh, not the advertising, you mean just the lobbyists, gotcha.
[02:46:05.394 --> 02:46:07.814]  Just the lobbyists, yeah.
[02:46:07.814 --> 02:46:15.576]  And we've got a situation now where in areas of America, three quarters of firefighters are rejecting it.
[02:46:16.351 --> 02:46:23.677]  Half of the nurses and health professionals, if not more, are rejecting it, are protesting about it.
[02:46:23.677 --> 02:46:39.049]  In Europe, Denmark, Finland, Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, Holland, the majority of the population, and in some cases a significant majority, including health professionals and firefighters and people like that, are rejecting it.
[02:46:40.356 --> 02:46:47.778]  And there's a mass uprising against it because of the information that's being put out by the people warning about what's in it.
[02:46:47.778 --> 02:47:03.362]  Now most people don't know that in America the federal government embarked on a campaign back in August where they spent 16 million dollars on a propaganda campaign to convince the public to take the swine flu vaccine.
[02:47:03.362 --> 02:47:06.743]  And now we're beginning to see where this money is being spent.
[02:47:07.768 --> 02:47:11.069]  You had the New York Times come out last week.
[02:47:11.069 --> 02:47:16.751]  We put out an article on this swine flu vaccine propaganda in New York Times.
[02:47:16.751 --> 02:47:25.554]  Where they provide an educational supplement which is given to teachers for pupils from grades 6 to 12.
[02:47:25.554 --> 02:47:33.216]  This is taught in schools because the New York Times has an agreement where it gets its propaganda put through the schooling system.
[02:47:34.565 --> 02:47:53.152]  And these kids are given this quote fact sheet called H1N1 vaccine facts or myths and it lists nine myths about the swine flu vaccine and as we document in this article every single one of them is a fact it's not a myth.
[02:47:53.152 --> 02:48:02.656]  There is mercury samarasol in the swine flu vaccine there is squalene in some of the swine flu vaccines and one of these so-called myths
[02:48:03.146 --> 02:48:03.847]  Let me stop you!
[02:48:03.847 --> 02:48:06.509]  This is what I was talking about at the start of the hour.
[02:48:19.097 --> 02:48:33.685]  I see him on TV news saying there's no side effects, no mercury, no Guillain-Barre, no seizures, when I just showed the insert from the vaccine saying it, it's on all the medical sites, and as your article states at PrisonPlanet.com,
[02:48:35.106 --> 02:48:36.967]  This has got to get out to everybody.
[02:48:36.967 --> 02:48:40.828]  They are lying, not just in New York, all over the country, the same thing's happening.
[02:48:40.828 --> 02:48:42.928]  From Oregon, we've gotten sent these fact sheets.
[02:48:42.928 --> 02:48:44.629]  From Texas, we've been sent them.
[02:48:44.629 --> 02:48:47.129]  They lie and say none of it's true.
[02:48:47.129 --> 02:48:54.531]  Even if you believe in vaccines, is it good to lie to everyone and say this isn't in there or that this can't happen?
[02:48:54.531 --> 02:48:57.052]  I mean, this is so incredible, Paul.
[02:48:59.019 --> 02:49:00.119]  And then the others.
[02:49:00.119 --> 02:49:14.644]  They say it's a myth that you can catch flu from the vaccine, when health professionals in Canada have spoken out repeatedly about the fact that the nasal myth contains live H1N1 virus that could spread the vaccine in people with weakened immune systems.
[02:49:14.644 --> 02:49:17.425]  Well that's the major headlines all over the Canadian news.
[02:49:17.425 --> 02:49:19.586]  The government put out a warning saying it.
[02:49:20.768 --> 02:49:25.131]  Yeah, but it's a myth according to this fact sheet that's going through all American schools.
[02:49:25.131 --> 02:49:35.518]  Well, Paul, it's a myth they set up a Bank of the World we're going to pay the carbon taxes to when it's in the Times of London, the Rothschilds run it, along with Al Gore and that Lord.
[02:49:35.518 --> 02:49:36.999]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[02:49:36.999 --> 02:49:43.783]  They just keep denying, denying, and no wonder some people out in the media and listening to the media think we're liars.
[02:49:43.783 --> 02:49:50.528]  They tune in, don't check that we're telling the truth, and think we're complete liars because how could the media lie?
[02:49:50.868 --> 02:49:52.088]  How could mainstream media lie?
[02:49:52.088 --> 02:49:53.229]  They are lying.
[02:49:53.229 --> 02:49:55.349]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:49:55.349 --> 02:50:18.955]  Yeah, so if the notion that the swine flu vaccine contains mercury is a myth, and if the claim that it has side effects, potential side effects, is a myth, then maybe the New York Times can answer the question as to why the top German government officials, including the Chancellor, Angela Merkel,
[02:50:19.710 --> 02:50:29.993]  The troops in Germany, the German Army, have been given an additive-free swine flu vaccine that doesn't contain mercury.
[02:50:29.993 --> 02:50:38.156]  Now, if all of them didn't contain mercury, and they were all fine and contained no other ingredients whatsoever, then why... Oh, stay there, Paul.
[02:50:38.156 --> 02:50:39.276]  Stay there.
[02:50:39.276 --> 02:50:41.017]  Stay there, because I can barely hear you.
[02:50:41.017 --> 02:50:42.517]  When we come back, we're going to go over all this.
[02:50:42.517 --> 02:50:43.578]  Keep you till five after then.
[02:50:43.578 --> 02:50:44.578]  Carpley's joining us, but...
[02:50:45.871 --> 02:50:48.173]  I want the magnitude of this to hit.
[02:50:48.173 --> 02:50:54.699]  I believe the New York Times and other school districts giving these fake sheets out, and the pharmacies are giving out fake sheets.
[02:50:54.699 --> 02:50:56.861]  Not the drug insert, a fake sheet.
[02:50:56.861 --> 02:50:58.643]  I know they're liable.
[02:50:58.643 --> 02:51:00.845]  And they need to be sued when there's adverse reactions.
[02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:06.013]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[02:51:06.013 --> 02:51:10.297]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[02:51:10.297 --> 02:51:21.125]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.

[02:52:02.603 --> 02:52:06.626]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.626 --> 02:52:09.868]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.868 --> 02:52:15.031]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:15.031 --> 02:52:21.055]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.055 --> 02:52:23.297]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:23.837 --> 02:52:25.258]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:25.258 --> 02:52:26.920]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[02:52:48.377 --> 02:52:50.019]  A Fall of the Republic.
[02:52:50.019 --> 02:52:59.126]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[02:53:17.497 --> 02:53:22.259]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[02:53:22.259 --> 02:53:26.181]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[02:53:26.181 --> 02:53:30.323]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[02:53:30.603 --> 02:53:31.164]  We're good.
[02:54:11.486 --> 02:54:27.117]  How do we know that the establishment's making their move?
[02:54:27.117 --> 02:54:28.058]  They're blowing the trumpet.
[02:54:28.058 --> 02:54:29.499]  They're moving the troops in.
[02:54:29.499 --> 02:54:32.842]  They're cutting off cars with the OnStar when police are chasing people.
[02:54:33.522 --> 02:54:39.827]  They're lying and saying there's no mercury in the shots, it can't cause infertility, can't cause cancer, but it's on the inserts.
[02:54:39.827 --> 02:54:50.995]  Here's the insert on the influenza A H1N1 2009 vaccine, and here it says mercury right here.
[02:54:50.995 --> 02:54:53.678]  You can go read the inserts.
[02:54:53.678 --> 02:54:56.660]  I've got an adverse reaction sheet
[02:54:59.235 --> 02:55:06.600]  Right here as well, the ones that they actually give the doctors, that's more detailed.
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:11.123]  And it goes over all the different risk.
[02:55:11.123 --> 02:55:12.603]  Guillain-Barré syndrome.
[02:55:13.564 --> 02:55:17.426]  This is from Norvitis Vaccine Diagnostics Limited.
[02:55:17.426 --> 02:55:19.207]  This is from the biggest vaccine maker.
[02:55:19.207 --> 02:55:20.608]  There's five companies making it.
[02:55:20.608 --> 02:55:22.069]  Oh, here, this is from Norvitis.
[02:55:22.069 --> 02:55:23.990]  Maybe the New York Times should get this.
[02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:29.933]  And I could keep going through all the cancer and all the infertility and everything else for people, Paul.
[02:55:29.933 --> 02:55:32.975]  We've done this on show after show, but I guess we're just liars, Paul.
[02:55:32.975 --> 02:55:39.578]  I guess I wrote this up and lied about it and posted this, but I didn't.
[02:55:39.578 --> 02:55:40.659]  But that doesn't matter, Paul.
[02:55:40.659 --> 02:55:42.160]  They'll just lie and say it doesn't exist.
[02:55:43.931 --> 02:55:50.036]  It's amazing though, Alex, because there are two different versions of the swine flu vaccine.
[02:55:50.036 --> 02:56:01.085]  One which was produced by Baxter has none of these additives in it whatsoever, and that's the one that Angela Merkel and the German army and the top German officials have received.
[02:56:01.085 --> 02:56:03.247]  No doubt that's the one that Obama will be getting.
[02:56:03.939 --> 02:56:09.542]  So why, A, why do they need, why can't everybody get this, quote, green vaccine?
[02:56:09.542 --> 02:56:18.567]  Why do the ones that we get have to have mercury in it, that causes autism, and squalene, and these animal cells that are cancerous?
[02:56:18.567 --> 02:56:23.009]  That's what's in our vaccine, but the elite get one that's preservative-free.
[02:56:23.009 --> 02:56:28.252]  Animal cells carrying cancer viruses, that's the German snooze.
[02:56:28.252 --> 02:56:31.173]  Yeah, it was in Der Spiegel.
[02:56:31.173 --> 02:56:32.334]  Nimmo wrote an article on it.
[02:56:32.813 --> 02:56:39.658]  We already knew that five months ago with our scientists we had on, but here it is all over the European press!
[02:56:39.658 --> 02:56:43.501]  And I mean, just go through the nine myths that we've got on this article.
[02:56:43.501 --> 02:56:47.945]  One of them is to say that the vaccine is untested.
[02:56:47.945 --> 02:56:50.126]  They're saying this is a myth.
[02:56:50.126 --> 02:56:54.069]  Manufacturers rushed the production of the vaccine to get it to market.
[02:56:54.069 --> 02:56:55.491]  That's admitted!
[02:56:55.491 --> 02:56:56.972]  That was in the London Times!
[02:56:57.603 --> 02:57:01.025]  And the pharmaceutical companies themselves admit that that's what it was.
[02:57:01.025 --> 02:57:02.426]  Yes, it was never tested.
[02:57:02.426 --> 02:57:05.067]  You can Google that and see hundreds of mainstream articles.
[02:57:05.067 --> 02:57:14.313]  But the New York Times and the inserts that they're giving school children all over the country say it isn't true.
[02:57:14.313 --> 02:57:18.375]  We've got links to where they admit that it wasn't tested properly.
[02:57:18.375 --> 02:57:25.499]  And number seven is the vaccine contains a dangerous adjuvant, a chemical added to enhance the immune response.
[02:57:25.499 --> 02:57:26.680]  They're saying that that's a myth.
[02:57:27.717 --> 02:57:31.920]  When we know it contains damarisol and squalene.
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:42.488]  And in fact, the New York Times itself reported on the fact that these non-additive H1N1 vaccines would be available, but there wouldn't be enough for the general population.
[02:57:42.488 --> 02:57:46.231]  So the Times itself reports on it and then says it's a myth.
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:58:02.493]  Well, that's why they're losing all credibility and now getting a government bailout, and that's why Obama's had public meetings saying the alternative media is a threat to newspapers, the government and the mainstream media teaming up to censor us, because of course they're going to lose!
[02:58:02.493 --> 02:58:04.134]  We're telling the truth, they're lying!
[02:58:05.948 --> 02:58:06.988]  It's unbelievable.
[02:58:06.988 --> 02:58:08.929]  I mean, these people are unbelievable.
[02:58:08.929 --> 02:58:17.352]  Paul, this is a crime to sit there and lie and say, this is actually from FDA.gov, this Norvitis Vaccine Diagnostics Limited.
[02:58:17.352 --> 02:58:19.993]  Give folks a close shot at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:19.993 --> 02:58:21.854]  FDA.gov!
[02:58:21.854 --> 02:58:23.234]  That's where this is from!
[02:58:23.234 --> 02:58:25.895]  Guillain-Barré's.
[02:58:25.895 --> 02:58:26.675]  Cancer.
[02:58:26.675 --> 02:58:28.336]  Brain damage.
[02:58:28.336 --> 02:58:30.077]  Infertility.
[02:58:30.077 --> 02:58:30.857]  Heaven help us!
[02:58:32.810 --> 02:58:33.891]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:58:33.891 --> 02:58:35.513]  Guillain-Barré Syndrome!
[02:58:35.513 --> 02:58:37.195]  Right there!
[02:58:37.195 --> 02:58:38.436]  FDA.gov!
[02:58:38.436 --> 02:58:42.761]  We're not making anything up!
[02:58:42.761 --> 02:58:44.183]  You are listening to GCN!
[02:58:44.183 --> 02:58:46.946]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:51.854 --> 02:58:54.857]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.857 --> 02:59:00.182]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:59:00.182 --> 02:59:02.244]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:02.244 --> 02:59:07.249]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:07.249 --> 02:59:08.170]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.410 --> 02:59:09.531]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.531 --> 02:59:11.413]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.413 --> 02:59:12.493]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.493 --> 02:59:14.695]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.695 --> 02:59:16.036]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:16.036 --> 02:59:17.578]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.578 --> 02:59:22.842]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.842 --> 02:59:26.425]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.425 --> 02:59:29.888]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:30.228 --> 02:59:31.449]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.449 --> 02:59:32.369]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.369 --> 02:59:33.470]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.470 --> 02:59:34.390]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.390 --> 02:59:35.491]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.491 --> 02:59:38.533]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.533 --> 02:59:39.073]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:39.073 --> 02:59:40.734]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.734 --> 02:59:41.734]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.734 --> 02:59:42.955]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.955 --> 02:59:44.776]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:06.966 --> 03:00:11.951]  I've got an important alert about when we're going to be releasing Fall of the Republic in the next segment.
[03:00:11.951 --> 03:00:13.413]  Stay with us for that.
[03:00:13.413 --> 03:00:17.617]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.tv, the front page has changed.
[03:00:17.617 --> 03:00:19.859]  We put it on another server.
[03:00:19.859 --> 03:00:27.827]  Just so you can sign up, watch Fall of the Republic in one hour exactly, and right now you can watch us live for free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:29.429 --> 03:00:37.293]  Because members and the general public can't access the regular site with the thousands of videos, audio, my book, Paul Watson's book, and so much more.
[03:00:37.293 --> 03:00:40.354]  And after the traffic hump goes down, that'll be back up.
[03:00:40.354 --> 03:00:49.919]  It's up for some, it's getting hit by so many, but hopefully putting this simple page up will kill a lot of that traffic we're getting so the main site will be accessible.
[03:00:49.919 --> 03:00:51.660]  Same thing happened with the Sheen deal.
[03:00:51.660 --> 03:00:54.541]  This happens more and more when we launch something big, we just shut down.
[03:00:56.132 --> 03:00:57.754]  So, uh, that is live there.
[03:00:57.754 --> 03:01:03.240]  I'm going to keep Watson a little bit in with Tarpley on the situation I ran, then let him go in about 10 minutes.
[03:01:03.240 --> 03:01:06.264]  But we'll go ahead and get Tarpley on right now as well.
[03:01:06.264 --> 03:01:09.968]  Paul Watson, finishing up with the flu.
[03:01:09.968 --> 03:01:11.630]  There's so many other facets to this.
[03:01:11.630 --> 03:01:12.571]  The good news is
[03:01:13.936 --> 03:01:16.157]  The good news is, people aren't buying the fraud.
[03:01:16.157 --> 03:01:27.320]  The bad news is, they admit that millions of people have taken the nasal live virus, one that can breed it, mutate it, and spread it, and now that's why 30 plus percent of the public's infected with it, but not getting sick.
[03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:29.041]  Who knows what the virus is carrying?
[03:01:29.041 --> 03:01:33.842]  Because they've now proven there's all these sub-particles and mycoplasms they can engineer into it.
[03:01:33.842 --> 03:01:35.983]  So I see a lot of different angles that are dangerous right there.
[03:01:37.697 --> 03:01:46.504]  And I also have reports here, swine flu cases overestimated, CBS News exclusive, study of rate of results find H1N1 not as prevalent as feared.
[03:01:46.504 --> 03:01:58.392]  I told you this months ago with medical doctors, false reporting, hyping, lying about how dangerous it is, and it's not the flu pathogen, it's what else they're adding, folks.
[03:01:58.392 --> 03:02:00.974]  It's the vaccine that's bad.
[03:02:00.974 --> 03:02:05.958]  Also, Dell tried to create, Dell Children's Hospital tried to create the precedent
[03:02:08.726 --> 03:02:16.934]  Of putting up these fear-mongering tents where thousands of hypochondriacs per day at the peak in Central Texas were flooding in demanding the vaccine.
[03:02:16.934 --> 03:02:30.326]  But now, I heard them on the news last night on KLBJ News, report that only 160-something, I forget the exact, 168 I think, but it was 160-something, are showing up a day, so they're shutting down their little FEMA tent camps.
[03:02:30.626 --> 03:02:41.550]  By the way, remind Douglas to go shoot that right now, videotape that before they shut it down, because I need to have that for stock footage to show this camp they set up over there.
[03:02:41.550 --> 03:02:43.190]  So they're failing there.
[03:02:43.190 --> 03:02:48.232]  This is some really good news, is it not, Paul Watson?
[03:02:48.232 --> 03:02:49.912]  It's good news, yeah.
[03:02:49.912 --> 03:02:58.455]  And it shows why the establishment is having to get really desperate in convincing the idiot public in their eyes to take this shot.
[03:02:59.085 --> 03:03:08.970]  And as we've documented today, they're even going to the levels of implanting propaganda in primetime network television shows.
[03:03:08.970 --> 03:03:11.851]  And that's not an invention of paranoid conspiracy theorists.
[03:03:11.851 --> 03:03:26.358]  It was admitted last week, and they bragged about it, that all this week, on the major network TV shows, on ABC, Fox, CBS, NBC, that positive propaganda about Obama's healthcare agenda
[03:03:26.798 --> 03:03:28.059]  We're good to go.
[03:03:49.300 --> 03:03:59.248]  For a few seconds it cuts to a shot of a computer screen which shows a fake website with a big ad in the middle that says, Time for your flu shot!
[03:03:59.248 --> 03:04:02.331]  And then on the right hand side it says, Take it now!
[03:04:02.331 --> 03:04:08.956]  And this is overlaid over the cleavage of a woman who sat there to make everybody look at it.
[03:04:08.956 --> 03:04:18.043]  And it's blatant propaganda in the middle of this ABC drama show to get people to take the flu shot and it's desperation.
[03:04:21.992 --> 03:04:30.724]  Absolutely, I mean it's just when I rarely watch TV or my wife does when she's on the treadmill or whatever, you know, she downloads stuff off
[03:04:32.603 --> 03:04:34.124]  iTunes.
[03:04:34.124 --> 03:04:39.985]  She says almost every show she watches is pro-euthanasia, pro-vaccine, pro-abortion.
[03:04:39.985 --> 03:04:41.126]  There's too many people.
[03:04:41.126 --> 03:04:43.647]  Babies have too big a carbon footprint.
[03:04:43.647 --> 03:04:47.548]  And then the government admits, oh yes, the government's paying for all this on TV.
[03:04:47.548 --> 03:04:51.949]  Our tax money to produce these TV shows to brainwash people.
[03:04:51.949 --> 03:04:53.570]  We're going into total tyranny.
[03:04:53.570 --> 03:04:54.710]  Webster Tarpley's coming up.
[03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:57.571]  We'll talk about the Iran situation first and a lot more.
[03:04:57.571 --> 03:04:58.251]  Paul, stay there.
[03:04:58.251 --> 03:05:00.792]  I want you to do five minutes on that when we get back with Tarpley.
[03:05:01.172 --> 03:05:06.477]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:05:06.477 --> 03:05:11.002]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:05:11.002 --> 03:05:13.284]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:05:13.284 --> 03:05:14.906]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:05:14.906 --> 03:05:15.947]  There is a solution.
[03:05:16.167 --> 03:05:24.590]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:07:13.106 --> 03:07:14.186]  It's very real.
[03:07:14.186 --> 03:07:14.547]  I know.
[03:07:14.547 --> 03:07:18.768]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[03:07:18.768 --> 03:07:21.989]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.

[03:07:52.856 --> 03:07:57.220]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:57.220 --> 03:08:00.262]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.274 --> 03:08:21.659]  Tarpley and I are exchanging nicknames for each other.
[03:08:21.659 --> 03:08:25.664]  We'll keep those private and personal.
[03:08:25.664 --> 03:08:27.486]  A doctorate in history, Ph.D.
[03:08:27.486 --> 03:08:31.071]  in history, Ph.D.
[03:08:31.071 --> 03:08:34.495]  in economics, just a great political mind.
[03:08:34.495 --> 03:08:35.337]  We're going to talk about
[03:08:36.397 --> 03:08:50.683]  The four different Al Qaeda groups openly, the White House admits, under Bush and Obama, launching terror attacks in Iran, blowing up police stations, bombing schools, bombing dams, blowing up command military bases, killing Iran's number three general.
[03:08:51.556 --> 03:08:54.038]  And Iran is suing the U.S.
[03:08:54.038 --> 03:08:54.679]  and the U.N.
[03:08:54.679 --> 03:08:55.920]  for doing it.
[03:08:55.920 --> 03:09:01.365]  Our government blows their buildings up and then admits it and says, do something, Iran.
[03:09:01.365 --> 03:09:01.905]  Do something.
[03:09:01.905 --> 03:09:03.787]  That's got nukes aiming at them.
[03:09:03.787 --> 03:09:04.768]  I mean, this is so evil.
[03:09:04.768 --> 03:09:05.549]  We're going to talk about that.
[03:09:05.549 --> 03:09:08.151]  But Paul Watson's written detailed articles on this.
[03:09:08.151 --> 03:09:09.973]  I wanted Watson to give us his take on it.
[03:09:09.973 --> 03:09:16.418]  Then we're going to Webster Tarpley on that front, on what's happening with the death of the dollar, what's happening with fall of the republic that Webster is in.
[03:09:17.659 --> 03:09:22.884]  We're going to discuss it all in the balance of the show today and jam some calls in from Steve, Chris, Jay, Gabby.
[03:09:22.884 --> 03:09:24.725]  Gabby's going to gab on the air with us.
[03:09:24.725 --> 03:09:35.234]  Today, in the last 50 minutes, 50 and a half minutes we have left, before the premiere at PrisonPlanet.tv of Fall of Republic.
[03:09:35.234 --> 03:09:39.678]  And just for the general public today, the last hour of the show is free, video-wise.
[03:09:39.678 --> 03:09:42.200]  The radio is obviously free, but we've got to pay for the bandwidth.
[03:09:42.200 --> 03:09:45.763]  For PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.tv is free right now for video viewers.
[03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:51.241]  uh... for the live show and it's your fifteen cents a day as a prison planet dot tv member
[03:09:53.052 --> 03:09:59.635]  $5.95 a month, get a yearly membership instead of a monthly, trial and get three months free, that funds all of this and allows this to happen.
[03:09:59.635 --> 03:10:02.036]  So I want to thank all the members out there.
[03:10:02.036 --> 03:10:05.097]  But members will be able to watch the film in T-minus 50 minutes.
[03:10:05.097 --> 03:10:06.818]  Start your engines!
[03:10:06.818 --> 03:10:10.520]  You know, they've got the checkered flags out.
[03:10:10.520 --> 03:10:13.081]  They're getting ready here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:13.081 --> 03:10:17.162]  Is it the checkered flag when the race starts and the green when they win?
[03:10:17.162 --> 03:10:18.123]  Or is it the green flag
[03:10:19.415 --> 03:10:24.757]  Yeah, so it's the checkered, getting the checkered flag pole position is when you win.
[03:10:24.757 --> 03:10:26.177]  So the green flags are out.
[03:10:26.177 --> 03:10:43.983]  And it's going, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot
[03:10:45.126 --> 03:10:47.468]  We, and I've played Mario Kart one time.
[03:10:47.468 --> 03:10:51.011]  I think I've let my kids play it maybe a hundred times.
[03:10:51.011 --> 03:10:55.014]  I let them play the sports games and that's it, but the golf and stuff, it's good for them.
[03:10:55.014 --> 03:10:56.975]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up about that.
[03:10:56.975 --> 03:10:58.777]  The point is, let us now go to Paul Watson.
[03:10:58.777 --> 03:11:02.220]  Paul, give us your quick take on what's happening in Iran.
[03:11:02.220 --> 03:11:11.167]  This is a bold move to publicly stage terror attacks all over Iran and publicly brag about it while the West calls themselves peaceniks.
[03:11:11.167 --> 03:11:12.488]  The non-nuclear Iran
[03:11:14.469 --> 03:11:25.534]  Well, Alex, on Sunday there was a suicide bomb attack against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard at their headquarters in a place called Peshin, if I'm saying that right, which is near the border with Pakistan.
[03:11:44.454 --> 03:12:02.323]  And it was carried out, admittedly, they took the blame for it, by this Sunni terrorist group known as Jundullah, which was formerly headed by the alleged 9-11 mastermind, the Patsy, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[03:12:02.323 --> 03:12:07.005]  Now, the press reacted to this terrorist attack by
[03:12:08.450 --> 03:12:14.694]  Kind of swinging between Iranian accusations and blanket denials on behalf of the U.S.
[03:12:14.694 --> 03:12:20.218]  and Britain that it was a terrorist attack launched by the U.S.
[03:12:20.218 --> 03:12:33.027]  and the British against the Iranians by proxy because the Jundala organization admittedly, and this was reported by the London Telegraph, ABC News amongst many others in 2007,
[03:12:35.151 --> 03:12:39.676]  is armed and trained by the CIA and Mossad.
[03:12:39.676 --> 03:12:47.824]  It's not even up for debate, and that's what I found incredible about this, you know, the reports about the accusations.
[03:12:47.824 --> 03:12:49.146]  It's not even up for debate.
[03:12:49.146 --> 03:12:50.567]  It's confirmed.
[03:12:50.567 --> 03:12:57.755]  This is an al-Qaeda offshoot organization, or the CIA Arab Legion, as Webster calls it.
[03:12:58.544 --> 03:13:07.991]  And it's controlled by the CIA and they're using it to destabilize the Iranian government by carrying out terrorist attacks against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.
[03:13:07.991 --> 03:13:16.097]  And by the way, by the way, it is not just Times of London or ABC News that reported this in 2007.
[03:13:16.097 --> 03:13:20.480]  Cy Hirsch, Webster Tarpley, myself, countless others have reported this in 2003, 2004, 2005.
[03:13:25.063 --> 03:13:36.353]  In 2007, the White House.gov, the White House website, put a press release out saying we're funding these four groups to stage attacks, and they didn't even debate that No.
[03:13:36.353 --> 03:13:37.714]  3 al-Qaeda ran it.
[03:13:37.714 --> 03:13:40.677]  Al-Qaeda publicly works for our criminal government.
[03:13:43.560 --> 03:13:50.162]  It's just like the New York Times saying there's no mercury in the flu shot when all their inserts say it, and FDA.gov says it.
[03:13:50.162 --> 03:13:52.803]  It's just a new level of lying.
[03:13:52.803 --> 03:13:55.884]  Final comments, we're going to Webster Tarbley.
[03:13:55.884 --> 03:14:03.247]  Yeah, the other thing is that when members of this group were arrested by Pakistan last year and handed over to Iran,
[03:14:04.191 --> 03:14:12.077]  One of the top leaders of the Jundala Group admitted in court that they were being trained and armed by the US and Israel.
[03:14:12.077 --> 03:14:17.981]  And this was the brother of the leader of the group, Abdullamalek Rigi.
[03:14:17.981 --> 03:14:20.823]  And his brother admitted that they were being trained by the US.
[03:14:20.823 --> 03:14:23.965]  It's admitted by the White House itself.
[03:14:23.965 --> 03:14:25.847]  It's been reported widely.
[03:14:25.847 --> 03:14:30.150]  And yet it's still debatable whether the US and Britain and Israel
[03:14:30.723 --> 03:14:31.844]  is behind this attack.
[03:14:31.844 --> 03:14:33.685]  They're obviously behind the attack.
[03:14:33.685 --> 03:14:42.693]  It took out one of the key men in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard who was instrumental in calming the tensions in that region.
[03:14:42.693 --> 03:14:45.235]  They targeted him for elimination and he's dead.
[03:14:45.805 --> 03:14:49.289]  So there's no debate who's behind this, and it just goes to show.
[03:14:49.289 --> 03:14:59.639]  And then meanwhile, they get up on the news and say Iran is running Al Qaeda and Taliban, the Sunni group, the arch enemies of Shiite Iran.
[03:14:59.639 --> 03:15:04.844]  This is like saying the Dallas Cowboys are the Washington Redskins, or Superman is Lex Luthor.
[03:15:04.844 --> 03:15:06.425]  I mean, it's just... or Hitler is...
[03:15:09.148 --> 03:15:10.609]  is Franklin Roosevelt.
[03:15:10.609 --> 03:15:17.594]  I mean, it's a total flipping and Iran is fighting Al-Qaeda, saying it's a globalist run, U.S.-British-Israeli run.
[03:15:17.594 --> 03:15:20.275]  It's on record.
[03:15:20.275 --> 03:15:26.640]  Tell folks the headline on the great article you wrote a few days ago so people can go read the details and see all those links.
[03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:27.800]  The article is, U.S.
[03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:31.603]  attacks Iran via CIA-funded Jundala terror group.
[03:15:32.622 --> 03:15:33.702]  All right, good job, Watson.
[03:15:33.702 --> 03:15:34.923]  Keep it up.
[03:15:34.923 --> 03:15:45.048]  I look forward to the launch of Fall of the Republic at PrisonPlanet.tv that you're honchoing with Matt and Kevin and others here at the office in T-minus 44 minutes.
[03:15:45.048 --> 03:15:46.128]  Thank you so much.
[03:15:46.128 --> 03:15:47.369]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:15:47.369 --> 03:15:50.170]  Okay, Webster, I'm going to let you take it out to break in five minutes.
[03:15:50.170 --> 03:15:53.511]  I've actually got to go work on IT stuff and give some orders here.
[03:15:53.511 --> 03:16:01.035]  Take us to break with the Jandela situation, and we'll come back, finish up with that, then get into the economics, the banking meltdown you predicted a decade ago.
[03:16:02.051 --> 03:16:03.873]  Webster Tarpley, good to have you here with us.
[03:16:03.873 --> 03:16:06.715]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:16:06.715 --> 03:16:11.740]  Let me address this terror attack, since that's our leading issue at the moment.
[03:16:11.740 --> 03:16:17.666]  This was a suicide bomb in the province of Balochistan.
[03:16:18.388 --> 03:16:24.493]  That is to say, in the southeast of Iran, near the border with Pakistan.
[03:16:24.493 --> 03:16:32.079]  And it was claimed by this Jundala organization, which is simply a CIA MI6 secret army.
[03:16:32.079 --> 03:16:33.780]  It's a well-known front.
[03:16:33.780 --> 03:16:36.102]  Now, this was a very serious bombing attack.
[03:16:36.102 --> 03:16:43.908]  It was an assembly of local and regional notables, as well as some representatives from Tehran.
[03:16:43.908 --> 03:16:46.810]  It was a kind of a ceremonial occasion, and it killed about
[03:16:47.610 --> 03:16:52.193]  30 people, according to some accounts, and up to 60 people, according to others.
[03:16:52.193 --> 03:17:06.040]  And one of the people killed was the ground forces commander of the Iranian Pasteran Revolutionary Guard, as well as the commander of the Revolutionary Guard, or Pasteran, in that southeastern corner
[03:17:06.793 --> 03:17:07.413]  Of Iran.
[03:17:07.413 --> 03:17:12.996]  Now, this Jundala has been around for quite a while, and the Iranians know it well.
[03:17:12.996 --> 03:17:24.282]  So the Iranian government immediately blamed the British, as well as the U.S., and the State Department spokesman here in Washington came out and said, oh no, we have nothing to do with that.
[03:17:24.282 --> 03:17:25.723]  Now, it's absolutely absurd.
[03:17:26.463 --> 03:17:32.069]  As Alex points out, because it's an absolute open secret that the U.S.
[03:17:32.069 --> 03:17:32.610]  runs this.
[03:17:32.610 --> 03:17:39.156]  I would say the British probably created it and continue to have significant influence, but the money seems to be coming from the U.S.
[03:17:39.156 --> 03:17:42.840]  and the targeting probably shared between Washington and London.
[03:17:42.840 --> 03:17:46.164]  Just a couple of these mainstream things in a little bit more detail.
[03:17:46.824 --> 03:17:55.247]  Back in February 2007, we have the London Daily Telegraph, notoriously close to NATO intelligence.
[03:17:55.247 --> 03:18:06.292]  They quote a former high-ranking CIA official saying that it's not a great secret that Jundala gets its money from the CIA classified budget.
[03:18:08.889 --> 03:18:09.329]  2007.
[03:18:09.329 --> 03:18:22.655]  They also have a guy called Fred Burton, a former United States State Department counter-terrorism official, who says that these attacks that were taking place already then in 2007 are part of U.S.
[03:18:22.655 --> 03:18:28.338]  efforts to supply and train Iran's ethnic minorities to destabilize the regime.
[03:18:29.162 --> 03:18:33.945]  If that's not enough, we have Brian Ross, ABC Television News.
[03:18:33.945 --> 03:18:36.707]  You can see this on TV for free.
[03:18:36.707 --> 03:18:39.869]  April 2007, the U.S.
[03:18:39.869 --> 03:18:45.553]  is encouraging and advising Jundula, and it's being run by the U.S.
[03:18:45.553 --> 03:18:52.877]  essentially out of bases inside Pakistan, but really not something you can blame on Pakistan when the U.S.
[03:18:52.877 --> 03:18:55.019]  and indeed the British are playing such an important role.
[03:18:55.599 --> 03:18:57.660]  And then we have Seymour Hersh.
[03:18:57.660 --> 03:19:02.864]  These are the famous articles that he wrote in the New Yorker during those years.
[03:19:02.864 --> 03:19:12.710]  And Seymour Hersh gets a hold of Robert Baer, the former CIA official of clandestine services.
[03:19:13.530 --> 03:19:16.292]  And he says that this is the U.S.
[03:19:16.292 --> 03:19:17.153]  paying for this.
[03:19:17.153 --> 03:19:17.613]  The U.S.
[03:19:17.613 --> 03:19:20.175]  is working now with Sunni fundamentalists.
[03:19:20.175 --> 03:19:21.536]  That's the trick with Jundala.
[03:19:21.536 --> 03:19:28.140]  Jundala are Sunni terrorists of the Salafi persuasion.
[03:19:28.140 --> 03:19:33.064]  And the idea is to set up a conflict which is ethnic as well as religious.
[03:19:33.904 --> 03:19:38.586]  Uh, with the, uh, them being against the Persian Shiites that are running the government in Tehran.
[03:19:38.586 --> 03:19:39.467]  Alright, let's just stay there.
[03:19:39.467 --> 03:19:40.267]  Keep breaking it down.
[03:19:40.267 --> 03:19:42.668]  And from what I've read, there's four different groups.
[03:19:42.668 --> 03:19:45.610]  Some are Wahhabist connected, others Sunni.
[03:19:45.610 --> 03:19:48.231]  Break down all these groups for us.
[03:19:48.231 --> 03:19:58.376]  And what Iran may do, I mean, imagine constant bombings blowing up government buildings, blowing up their military, blowing up their police.
[03:19:58.376 --> 03:20:00.397]  It's just insane.
[03:20:00.397 --> 03:20:01.057]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.801 --> 03:20:04.484]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[03:20:04.484 --> 03:20:06.347]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[03:20:06.347 --> 03:20:08.129]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[03:20:08.129 --> 03:20:12.094]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.

[03:21:02.832 --> 03:21:06.835]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.835 --> 03:21:10.097]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:10.097 --> 03:21:11.498]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:21:12.416 --> 03:21:14.877]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:14.877 --> 03:21:21.280]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.280 --> 03:21:26.462]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:26.462 --> 03:21:36.447]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.567 --> 03:21:38.908]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.908 --> 03:21:40.509]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.509 --> 03:21:42.970]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.970 --> 03:21:45.091]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:45.091 --> 03:21:50.233]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:50.233 --> 03:21:55.235]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:23:00.237 --> 03:23:06.841]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[03:23:06.841 --> 03:23:10.343]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:23:10.343 --> 03:23:16.066]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.

[03:24:06.465 --> 03:24:08.846]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:24:08.846 --> 03:24:11.588]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.

[03:24:32.155 --> 03:24:33.456]  Hit the ground running, folks.
[03:24:33.456 --> 03:24:35.617]  We're gonna give the Globalists a run for their money.
[03:24:35.617 --> 03:24:35.977]  Webster.
[03:24:37.079 --> 03:24:57.948]  Continuing along the line of these staged terror attacks using proxies from the West against the Iranians, openly trying to goad them, a type of false flag, to start responding, just like they had snuck attack Russia on 888 and said Russia did it, and a week later it came out it was all a lie, but they don't care.
[03:24:57.948 --> 03:25:01.830]  They just have disdain and contempt for the public that can't
[03:25:02.952 --> 03:25:06.163]  Some of them, I guess, find their butt with both hands.
[03:25:06.163 --> 03:25:08.210]  But where is this going?
[03:25:08.210 --> 03:25:09.093]  What's the reason for this?
[03:25:09.557 --> 03:25:17.019]  Well, one other feature of Balochistan that's important is that we have this very important city of Gwadar, this key strategic port.
[03:25:17.019 --> 03:25:37.566]  It's estimated that 40% of the oil tankers in the world go past the port of Gwadar, and the plan has always been to make an oil tanker terminal at Gwadar, so that if you're coming out of Kuwait or Saudi Arabia with a tanker load of oil, you put that into a pipeline that would go up through Pakistan
[03:25:38.346 --> 03:25:44.151]  And, uh, that would then get you into China, so the Chinese would have a guaranteed source of oil.
[03:25:44.151 --> 03:25:45.332]  You look at Balochistan.
[03:25:45.332 --> 03:25:49.515]  Balochistan cuts into Afghanistan, the southern part of that.
[03:25:49.515 --> 03:25:54.119]  It gives you a big chunk of Pakistan, and it gives you a significant part of Iran.
[03:25:54.119 --> 03:26:03.066]  So, this is one of the micro-states and mini-states that Zbigniew Brzezinski writes about in his books, and which are the goal of the Obama administration.
[03:26:03.066 --> 03:26:06.669]  Places like Pashtunistan, that would cut into Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[03:26:06.869 --> 03:26:10.590]  It has Brzezinski geopolitical designs written all over it.
[03:26:10.590 --> 03:26:12.930]  Absolutely, and it's only part of a pattern.
[03:26:12.930 --> 03:26:15.771]  Inside Iran, there are four or five of these ethnic groups.
[03:26:15.771 --> 03:26:30.453]  You've got the Baluchis, you've got a significant Arab minority along the Gulf, and that's where you've got your tanker terminal at Karg Island and your Abadan refinery, one of the largest in the world.
[03:26:30.453 --> 03:26:34.734]  There's also a Kurdish minority that the CIA has been playing out of Iraq.
[03:26:35.314 --> 03:26:36.996]  There's an Azeri minority coming from the North?
[03:26:36.996 --> 03:26:38.317]  Right, and you've also got then this Green Revolution.
[03:26:38.317 --> 03:26:39.739]  You've got the CIA coup faction, right?
[03:26:39.739 --> 03:26:42.582]  The rich elitist and desperate housewives of North Tehran.
[03:26:54.694 --> 03:27:01.497]  With their leaders, Mousavi and Rafsanjani, and they run around chanting, death to Russia, death to China.
[03:27:01.497 --> 03:27:02.898]  That couldn't be any clearer.
[03:27:02.898 --> 03:27:07.460]  If they seized power, they'd cut off the oil to China and make trouble for Russia.
[03:27:07.460 --> 03:27:15.784]  So this explains why Ahmadinejad is looking more and more like a traditional military dictator, leaning primarily on Russia.
[03:27:16.184 --> 03:27:16.885]  And the U.S.
[03:27:16.885 --> 03:27:23.870]  is, interestingly enough, on the side of the mullahs of the most benighted sort when you get into the situation in Tehran.
[03:27:23.870 --> 03:27:28.334]  So the idea is to tear Iran apart from several points of view.
[03:27:28.334 --> 03:27:32.877]  I do not think that there will be a huge bombing raid on Iran.
[03:27:32.877 --> 03:27:34.639]  There are acts of war going on.
[03:27:34.639 --> 03:27:35.940]  This was one of them.
[03:27:35.940 --> 03:27:39.743]  And these have been going on in these peripheral ethnic areas for quite a while.
[03:27:39.743 --> 03:27:43.386]  At the end of it, the Persians themselves would be left in a
[03:27:44.886 --> 03:27:54.490]  Let me ask you this question, Webster.
[03:27:54.490 --> 03:27:57.851]  Then what's the main strategic reason for this?
[03:27:57.851 --> 03:28:01.413]  Are they trying to get the Iranians to launch attacks?
[03:28:01.413 --> 03:28:08.916]  Is there truth to the Western headlines that the guard heads, the generals are saying, we will counter-strike?
[03:28:08.916 --> 03:28:09.896]  Or is that lies?
[03:28:10.305 --> 03:28:15.928]  Well, certainly they're going to retaliate if there were a huge bombing raid on Iran and their nuclear facilities.
[03:28:15.928 --> 03:28:18.509]  And actually, they'd retaliate with whatever they had.
[03:28:18.509 --> 03:28:21.631]  They could probably cut the tanker traffic through the streets.
[03:28:21.631 --> 03:28:24.813]  But they're saying they're going to respond to this.
[03:28:24.813 --> 03:28:28.135]  Well, in this case, though, I think it'll be proportional.
[03:28:28.135 --> 03:28:30.396]  And what that is, I guess, remains to be seen.
[03:28:31.355 --> 03:28:36.720]  The general idea, though, is to weaken Iran and play Iran against Russia and China.
[03:28:36.720 --> 03:28:39.663]  Brzezinski's goal is not to have the U.S.
[03:28:39.663 --> 03:28:40.463]  at war with Iran.
[03:28:40.463 --> 03:28:41.945]  What's the point of that?
[03:28:41.945 --> 03:28:54.335]  The point is to get Iran, if possible, either at war or locked in conflict with Russia and China, who are the main geopolitical enemies now, that Obama has come in and replaced the neocons, more or less, with the Brzezinskis.
[03:28:54.335 --> 03:28:56.317]  Quickly, Dan, what do you see happening in Iran?
[03:28:56.317 --> 03:28:56.998]  Where's this going?
[03:28:58.234 --> 03:29:00.574]  I think the Green coup has failed.
[03:29:00.574 --> 03:29:05.455]  I think it'll take a while for the CIA and company to figure that out.
[03:29:05.455 --> 03:29:14.817]  But the attempt to overthrow the government is failing, and I do think Ahmadinejad will evolve more and more towards a rather traditional military dictatorship.
[03:29:14.817 --> 03:29:24.299]  He's a military man, and I imagine they'll be able to deal with these peripheral terrorists in the relatively brutal way that would be usual.
[03:29:25.902 --> 03:29:27.543]  The Savak methods.
[03:29:27.543 --> 03:29:28.844]  I suppose, yes, the Savak.
[03:29:28.844 --> 03:29:31.565]  Savama Savak.
[03:29:31.565 --> 03:29:32.946]  All right, Webster Tarpley, stay there.
[03:29:32.946 --> 03:29:39.070]  I want to shift gears out of this, into the economy, into the plunging dollar.
[03:29:39.070 --> 03:29:41.711]  Different countries saying they want a debt moratorium.
[03:29:41.711 --> 03:29:42.732]  We'll talk about it all.
[03:29:42.732 --> 03:29:48.675]  We're now 30 minutes and 15 seconds away from the release of Paul of the Republic.
[03:29:48.675 --> 03:29:51.917]  We're trying to save the Republic.
[03:29:51.917 --> 03:29:53.318]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.318 --> 03:29:54.819]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.838 --> 03:29:58.530]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.237 --> 03:30:05.800]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:30:05.800 --> 03:30:06.701]  Number 1.
[03:30:06.701 --> 03:30:10.144]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:30:10.144 --> 03:30:10.984]  Number 2.
[03:30:10.984 --> 03:30:15.888]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:30:15.888 --> 03:30:16.628]  It's true.
[03:30:16.628 --> 03:30:21.512]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:30:21.512 --> 03:30:22.333]  Number 3.
[03:30:22.333 --> 03:30:25.915]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:30:25.915 --> 03:30:29.618]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:30:29.818 --> 03:30:30.619]  Number 4.
[03:30:30.619 --> 03:30:33.382]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:30:33.382 --> 03:30:37.066]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:30:37.066 --> 03:30:37.847]  Number 5.
[03:30:37.847 --> 03:30:41.992]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:30:41.992 --> 03:30:46.757]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:30:47.037 --> 03:30:51.202]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:51.202 --> 03:30:53.004]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:53.004 --> 03:30:55.247]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[03:31:03.030 --> 03:31:07.036]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:07.036 --> 03:31:10.280]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.280 --> 03:31:15.086]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:31:15.086 --> 03:31:18.932]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[03:31:19.577 --> 03:31:21.459]  And they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.459 --> 03:31:27.006]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:27.006 --> 03:31:29.930]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:31:29.930 --> 03:31:36.658]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.758 --> 03:31:39.119]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:39.119 --> 03:31:40.699]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.699 --> 03:31:43.160]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.160 --> 03:31:45.281]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.281 --> 03:31:50.423]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.423 --> 03:31:55.444]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:31:55.444 --> 03:32:03.707]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:32:03.707 --> 03:32:06.308]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[03:32:06.795 --> 03:32:09.437]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[03:32:09.437 --> 03:32:13.200]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.
[03:32:13.200 --> 03:32:19.886]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[03:32:19.886 --> 03:32:23.769]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[03:32:23.769 --> 03:32:28.153]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[03:32:28.153 --> 03:32:31.756]  Nutroversal Foods from eFoods Direct, your new comfort food.
[03:32:31.756 --> 03:32:33.077]  Incredible taste, easy to
[03:32:37.278 --> 03:32:37.958]  We're good to go!
[03:33:19.935 --> 03:33:21.817]  We're cutting it close.
[03:33:21.817 --> 03:33:24.099]  I was just talking to my IT guys.
[03:33:24.099 --> 03:33:26.741]  We think it'll be ready at 3 o'clock.
[03:33:26.741 --> 03:33:39.273]  To explain what happened, hundreds of thousands of people, many many dozens and dozens and hundreds of times I guess, more members than we have,
[03:33:40.467 --> 03:33:45.271]  Are all hitting prisonplanet.tv wanting to see it, but not signing up to see it.
[03:33:45.271 --> 03:33:47.093]  Just thinking, I guess it's there for free.
[03:33:47.093 --> 03:33:47.793]  We can't do that.
[03:33:47.793 --> 03:33:49.815]  I have to pay for these IT guys and the bandwidth.
[03:33:49.815 --> 03:33:51.336]  It's $5.95 a month.
[03:33:51.336 --> 03:33:53.318]  It's not hard to stream the video to you.
[03:33:53.318 --> 03:33:55.080]  We have the big CDNs.
[03:33:55.080 --> 03:34:04.308]  It's that the main site and server that prisonplanet.tv is on was weighed down and basically crashed and kept crashing every time we brought it back up today.
[03:34:04.308 --> 03:34:07.270]  And it's being bombarded so hard to just get in and bring it back up.
[03:34:07.270 --> 03:34:07.991]  It's hard to get in.
[03:34:10.879 --> 03:34:22.323]  So they've created a redirect to a basic page for PrisonPlanet.tv where you can sign up or if you're a member, click and watch Fall of the Republic.
[03:34:22.323 --> 03:34:25.805]  We want it to go live at 3 right when things end.
[03:34:25.805 --> 03:34:27.225]  They're saying now 15, 20, 30 minutes after 3.
[03:34:30.014 --> 03:34:35.216]  Because they're having to build some things, test some things, they have to make sure it all works this way.
[03:34:35.216 --> 03:34:35.976]  So that's going on.
[03:34:35.976 --> 03:34:38.977]  But it will be premiering today at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:34:38.977 --> 03:34:44.238]  And anybody who wants the DVD in the highest quality, you can just go to InfoWars.com and order it.
[03:34:44.238 --> 03:34:46.359]  We're shipping these bad boys out for two days.
[03:34:46.359 --> 03:34:48.399]  A lot of people are already getting these in the mail.
[03:34:48.399 --> 03:34:52.221]  I'm already getting emails and calls and seeing comments going, oh, it's incredible, it's so good.
[03:34:52.221 --> 03:34:56.482]  So it'll be going up on PrisonPlanet.tv in the next, what, hour?
[03:34:57.600 --> 03:34:58.401]  Am I good for that?
[03:34:58.401 --> 03:35:00.403]  You said that during the break, but I want to know.
[03:35:00.403 --> 03:35:03.666]  In the next hour, maybe even right at 3, we'll see what's going to happen.
[03:35:03.666 --> 03:35:04.948]  Alright, going back to Webster Tarpley.
[03:35:04.948 --> 03:35:10.233]  Webster, anything else on the Iran situation?
[03:35:10.233 --> 03:35:14.277]  If not, I want to then get into what's happening with Obama, what's happening geopolitically.
[03:35:15.890 --> 03:35:19.831]  I had seen AP articles about Obama going to go after his enemies.
[03:35:19.831 --> 03:35:24.772]  Obama is going to go after people that have been criticizing him.
[03:35:24.772 --> 03:35:31.954]  We see there George Soros has five different publications he admittedly owns and runs and pays for.
[03:35:31.954 --> 03:35:34.195]  Some he owns, some he just finances.
[03:35:34.195 --> 03:35:40.537]  Attacking me saying I'm evil, I'm the greatest threat, oh I'm so horrible, oh I'm this criminal, oh I'm this right winger.
[03:35:40.537 --> 03:35:41.577]  All this made up stuff.
[03:35:43.440 --> 03:35:45.842]  And Salon, New Republic.
[03:35:45.842 --> 03:35:55.550]  New Republic just said, I'm this incredibly wicked, dangerous person who hypnotizes people and I'm this great threat that Obama deception is devastating.
[03:35:55.550 --> 03:35:58.912]  I mean, they're actually, usually they just call you a kook and a nut.
[03:35:58.912 --> 03:36:00.774]  They're saying I'm this great danger.
[03:36:00.774 --> 03:36:08.339]  Then it came out in the globe that there is a enemies list and of 25 people, I am number 24.
[03:36:08.339 --> 03:36:08.399]  Now,
[03:36:12.003 --> 03:36:15.346]  That hit list kind of comes out with a left-right paradigm angle.
[03:36:15.346 --> 03:36:22.131]  But then, meanwhile, this was first on the news yesterday, then he gave a speech today on the Senate floor.
[03:36:22.131 --> 03:36:24.893]  Alexander to White House, don't create enemies list.
[03:36:24.893 --> 03:36:29.397]  And Lamar Alexander, the Senator of Tennessee, he says, look, I work for Nixon.
[03:36:29.397 --> 03:36:32.419]  The enemies list, the dirty tricks, don't do it.
[03:36:32.419 --> 03:36:36.162]  He says he's confirmed internally that the operation is in full swing.
[03:36:38.616 --> 03:36:50.060]  uh... just all sorts of attacks on people disinformation and if they grab me, knock me over the head, inject me with heroin, kill me, and throw me in the bed with a dead hooker, folks, I didn't do it.
[03:36:50.060 --> 03:36:51.840]  What do you think about all this?
[03:36:51.840 --> 03:36:59.303]  Or is Alexander, who's a consummate insider, is this all part of the public threatening as well from an angle of, oh, I'm your friend?
[03:36:59.303 --> 03:37:01.483]  This is not a roll call today.
[03:37:01.483 --> 03:37:02.324]  Why do you think
[03:37:04.292 --> 03:37:06.453]  Because I know you always have a lot of inside info when you read all the news.
[03:37:06.453 --> 03:37:08.455]  What do you think is going on with this enemies list?
[03:37:08.455 --> 03:37:11.136]  Are they announcing it to intimidate everybody?
[03:37:11.136 --> 03:37:13.858]  What should I expect?
[03:37:13.858 --> 03:37:31.189]  Your take on where Obama's going, what's happening with the dollar, the open call for the end of the dollar, the bank of the world we pay our carbon taxes to, all this eugenicist propaganda, the White House admitting they're paying all the major TV dramas and top-rated shows to put out, pro-forced national service,
[03:37:32.438 --> 03:37:45.224]  Uh, messages, pro-Obama messages, I mean, I'm pinching myself, Webster Tarpley, as if I'm in an alternate dimension of total tyranny.
[03:37:45.224 --> 03:37:48.826]  Webster?
[03:37:48.826 --> 03:37:53.608]  We have IP phones and they drop quite often here, so we'll, uh, get him back on.
[03:37:53.608 --> 03:38:00.711]  I mean, you're like an alarm when those lines drop, because they just do it in... Or call him back on the landline.
[03:38:00.711 --> 03:38:01.732]  Call him back on the landline.
[03:38:04.355 --> 03:38:11.359]  Okay, and because he missed that entire rant, I just put out and I want his take on that.
[03:38:11.359 --> 03:38:12.580]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:38:12.580 --> 03:38:19.804]  You know, that brings me to the next issue of funding this operation.
[03:38:19.804 --> 03:38:21.125]  I need to hire more people.
[03:38:21.125 --> 03:38:32.231]  I need to, I got too little personnel doing too much, and just please buy all the DVDs, please support the sponsors, because they're the people that are making all of this possible.
[03:38:34.127 --> 03:38:38.228]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors right now that do make this show possible.
[03:38:38.228 --> 03:38:39.768]  One of them is FrontSite.com.
[03:38:39.768 --> 03:38:57.053]  It's a great firearms training website, a lot of great tips, a free newsletter you can sign up for, and you can get a free XD Armory pistol in the caliber of your choice when you sign up for the five days of world-class training at the FrontSite Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[03:38:57.053 --> 03:38:59.374]  You cannot beat this deal, and it is for a limited time.
[03:38:59.374 --> 03:39:00.054]  The fall is really
[03:39:01.054 --> 03:39:02.196]  This is out in Pahrump, Nevada.
[03:39:02.196 --> 03:39:03.617]  It's one of the best times to take the course.
[03:39:03.617 --> 03:39:05.579]  They have two-day courses, four-day, five-day.
[03:39:05.579 --> 03:39:06.900]  It's family-oriented.
[03:39:06.900 --> 03:39:09.183]  No drill instructor or tough-guy attitude.
[03:39:09.183 --> 03:39:10.644]  This is the best.
[03:39:10.644 --> 03:39:12.006]  FrontSite.com.
[03:39:12.006 --> 03:39:14.789]  Dr. Ignatius Piazza, the founder and owner, is a great guy.
[03:39:14.789 --> 03:39:16.330]  FrontSite.com.
[03:39:16.330 --> 03:39:18.853]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[03:39:21.775 --> 03:39:24.121]  Okay, Webster, I'm sorry our lines dropped to you.
[03:39:24.121 --> 03:39:27.950]  They seem to do that every hour or so as part of the booting process.
[03:39:27.950 --> 03:39:31.037]  Going back to you, I was talking about how
[03:39:32.822 --> 03:39:37.346]  Lamar Smith, the Senator, has gone to the floor today to say, please don't have the enemies list.
[03:39:37.346 --> 03:39:39.047]  He says he's confirmed there's one.
[03:39:39.047 --> 03:39:43.730]  It's come out mainstream news, not just tabloids now, that they are targeting their enemies.
[03:39:43.730 --> 03:39:47.233]  I am one of the people, chiefly, and they mention the Obama deception.
[03:39:47.233 --> 03:39:54.818]  That film really hit a nerve with them, and then I want to get into what's happening with the dollar, but you're a big part of the Obama deception.
[03:39:54.818 --> 03:40:00.703]  Now you're an even bigger part of all the Republic, and this nexuses and dovetails into the fact that
[03:40:01.710 --> 03:40:08.674]  The truth is really damaging to these people, and this is the fact that we're drawing blood on this criminal regime in the Infowar.
[03:40:08.674 --> 03:40:14.277]  This should be a cry of victory for us to know that we can drive these guys to ground.
[03:40:14.277 --> 03:40:15.698]  Your take on the enemies list.
[03:40:16.496 --> 03:40:17.897]  Well, I'm sure they have an enemies list.
[03:40:17.897 --> 03:40:18.718]  They have more than that.
[03:40:18.718 --> 03:40:21.121]  I think they actually have departments in the White House.
[03:40:21.121 --> 03:40:32.393]  There was a report coming from some people in Canada who had figured out that there was a special department at the White House which dealt with the birth certificate issue, raised by Phil Berg and others.
[03:40:33.293 --> 03:40:39.516]  And that was all it did, and I'm sure there's another one there for the Larry Sinclair issues and everything that goes with that.
[03:40:39.516 --> 03:40:42.158]  No, that's what the news says, and I want to make a correction interrupting.
[03:40:42.158 --> 03:40:43.678]  It's Lamar Alexander.
[03:40:43.678 --> 03:40:44.299]  Lamar Smith.
[03:40:44.299 --> 03:40:45.359]  I get names turned around.
[03:40:45.359 --> 03:40:46.420]  Senator Lamar Alexander.
[03:40:46.420 --> 03:40:46.680]  Go ahead.
[03:40:47.247 --> 03:40:48.527]  So they do have an enemies list.
[03:40:48.527 --> 03:41:03.652]  Now, in terms of the Obama deception and now the fall of the republic, the Obama deception in many ways is the preparation for breaking the spell, for dispelling the magic, for bringing Obama down to earth.
[03:41:03.652 --> 03:41:06.113]  I guess it must have come out in May, right?
[03:41:06.113 --> 03:41:13.755]  And then during the summer it had a tremendous impact, and what you saw then in June, July, August, in terms of a populist rebellion
[03:41:14.495 --> 03:41:18.361]  Of leftists and rightists against Obama, because it was both.
[03:41:18.361 --> 03:41:28.897]  You had old people who said, I want my Medicare, that's my Medicare from the New Deal and the Great Society, and you take your hands off it, Obama, because you want to give the money to Wall Street, what he really does.
[03:41:30.220 --> 03:41:32.481]  A broad consensus around that.
[03:41:32.481 --> 03:41:35.081]  Now, the question is now with the fall of the Republic.
[03:41:35.081 --> 03:41:40.203]  My ambition for the fall of the Republic is this should lead to gridlock in Washington.
[03:41:40.203 --> 03:41:44.144]  We have two parties of scoundrels and incompetent.
[03:41:44.144 --> 03:41:44.804]  They're corrupt.
[03:41:44.804 --> 03:41:46.304]  They're stupid.
[03:41:46.304 --> 03:41:50.545]  And they have all of these plans that we've been documenting.
[03:41:50.545 --> 03:41:53.606]  The only possible perspective right now is we want gridlock.
[03:41:53.966 --> 03:41:55.227]  We don't want any changes.
[03:41:55.227 --> 03:41:59.608]  I don't want the changes Obama wants, and I don't want the changes the Republicans want.
[03:41:59.608 --> 03:42:01.229]  So let's have gridlock.
[03:42:01.229 --> 03:42:04.590]  Let's have these institutions be paralyzed for the most part.
[03:42:04.590 --> 03:42:13.814]  But let me ask you, Webster, what should I be doing, because I really respect your perspective, what should I be doing being on the top 25 enemies list of the White House?
[03:42:13.814 --> 03:42:15.155]  I mean, that's pretty creepy.
[03:42:16.041 --> 03:42:18.143]  Well, that's a badge of honor, of course.
[03:42:18.143 --> 03:42:19.844]  Congratulations.
[03:42:19.844 --> 03:42:21.445]  That's excellent.
[03:42:21.445 --> 03:42:28.710]  Again, the main thing, I think, is to get into this idea that the Obama health care reform is a monstrosity.
[03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:33.214]  However, there's a grave danger that Obama and the Republicans could make a deal.
[03:42:33.214 --> 03:42:38.358]  The one thing they could agree on is they could say, let's destroy Medicare.
[03:42:38.358 --> 03:42:39.398]  Let's take $500 billion
[03:42:40.519 --> 03:42:44.202]  Out of Medicare, let's strip the American people of their economic rights.
[03:42:44.202 --> 03:42:47.145]  Let's also destroy Medicaid in the process.
[03:42:47.145 --> 03:42:50.207]  And this is something that some Republicans have said.
[03:42:50.207 --> 03:42:57.353]  That they could see common ground with Obama when it comes to stripping away the economic rights of the American people.
[03:42:57.353 --> 03:42:57.893]  Let me add this.
[03:42:57.893 --> 03:42:59.715]  We're going to get into the dollar, because you're absolutely right.
[03:42:59.715 --> 03:43:09.523]  When I was in the airport last Wednesday and bought this Wall Street Journal I'm showing people on TV, Wednesday, October 14th, headline, insurers stand against Obama committee's plan.
[03:43:11.859 --> 03:43:12.400]  Excuse me.
[03:43:12.400 --> 03:43:21.930]  And then in the article, they have the spokesman for the healthcare insurance lobby.
[03:43:21.930 --> 03:43:23.912]  It says he's the head guy who speaks for them.
[03:43:25.759 --> 03:43:29.322]  You know, I guess from the papal seat, or however you'd put it.
[03:43:29.322 --> 03:43:34.266]  And he's there speaking for them, and he says, we wrote this bill.
[03:43:34.266 --> 03:43:40.251]  We wrote the takeover of healthcare, and we want bigger fines if you don't come get our insurance.
[03:43:40.251 --> 03:43:48.018]  We want liability protection, so they can basically get more money, make you get their insurance, then lower the care, everything you said six months ago.
[03:43:49.124 --> 03:43:59.012]  But then when you watch the mainstream news, the controlled left acts like, oh insurance companies who are greedy and bad, which they are greedy and bad in many cases, they don't want this bill when they wrote it.
[03:43:59.012 --> 03:44:10.580]  Now because of pressure, stripping the fine if you don't get it, and stripping a lot of this corporate welfare, now they're threatening to back out of what they wrote.
[03:44:10.580 --> 03:44:18.346]  So every time these fake George Soros leftists, who just want a new tax on health care to pay to the banks, every time they get
[03:44:19.087 --> 03:44:22.630]  There's also this question about what they call the mandate.
[03:44:22.630 --> 03:44:24.832]  In other words, that every individual is forced to buy insurance.
[03:44:38.084 --> 03:44:42.766]  From a for-profit private healthcare company, which is what it's going to be.
[03:44:42.766 --> 03:44:52.830]  It's a for-profit, deregulated company, with 33% overhead, with executive perks, golden parachutes, lobbying budget, advertising budget.
[03:44:52.830 --> 03:44:56.112]  The interesting question is, how can that be constitutional?
[03:44:56.112 --> 03:44:56.932]  How can the U.S.
[03:44:56.932 --> 03:45:01.194]  government coerce anybody into buying something from a private company?
[03:45:02.466 --> 03:45:07.349]  When they usually say, well, you get insurance for your car, fine.
[03:45:07.349 --> 03:45:11.451]  An automobile, you can get a driver's license without insurance.
[03:45:11.451 --> 03:45:16.454]  If you want to put a car on the road, then many states require liability insurance.
[03:45:16.454 --> 03:45:18.275]  This is not the same thing.
[03:45:18.275 --> 03:45:28.741]  What Obama's basically saying is, just because you're there, because you're alive and breathing in the United States, you're going to be forced to go to WellPoint and Blue Cross and give them
[03:45:29.341 --> 03:45:32.503]  What, uh, 13-15% of your income?
[03:45:32.503 --> 03:45:34.684]  I don't see how that can be done constitutionally.
[03:45:34.684 --> 03:45:40.967]  I think there's a real constitutional barrier to that, because otherwise I'm being forced to buy something from a private company.
[03:45:40.967 --> 03:45:41.808]  This makes no sense.
[03:45:43.709 --> 03:45:45.150]  Absolutely.
[03:45:45.150 --> 03:45:54.696]  Okay, so whether it comes from Republicans or Democrats, either way, it's special interest trying to loot people because the system is so corrupt.
[03:45:54.696 --> 03:45:57.557]  Any way you slice it, they're involved in a fraud.
[03:45:57.557 --> 03:45:59.378]  We'll have you back up soon to talk about that.
[03:45:59.378 --> 03:46:01.740]  Let's shift gears in the time we have left, Webster.
[03:46:01.740 --> 03:46:08.304]  The global economic crises that over 10 years ago you wrote your economic tome on,
[03:46:08.724 --> 03:46:14.651]  We actually sell the latest edition of that at InfoWars.com for people that are interested in surviving the economic cataclysm.
[03:46:14.651 --> 03:46:17.374]  It's happening just as you broke it down.
[03:46:17.374 --> 03:46:18.615]  What are we dealing with?
[03:46:18.615 --> 03:46:20.637]  Open G20 announcing world government.
[03:46:20.637 --> 03:46:23.300]  Carbon taxes we'll pay to them.
[03:46:23.300 --> 03:46:28.185]  Just a planetary dictatorship run by a bunch of made-off Ken Lay types.
[03:46:28.185 --> 03:46:29.467]  Where do you see all this going?
[03:46:29.940 --> 03:46:42.546]  Well, I hope very much that this Copenhagen conference, which they want to impose this yoke, they want to crucify humanity on a cross of carbon in Copenhagen in December, I hope that's going to be a failure.
[03:46:42.546 --> 03:46:46.308]  And there are some pretty powerful forces that are making it a failure.
[03:46:46.308 --> 03:46:58.074]  China and India have had joint meetings where they say, we will not be bound by this insanity, we will not be stifled and strangled and frustrated in our economic development because a bunch of rich elitists
[03:46:58.514 --> 03:47:04.635]  In London and New York decide that they have some carbon phobia, carbon fetish, whatever it is.
[03:47:04.635 --> 03:47:08.756]  So I think there's a very good chance that the Copenhagen Conference will blow up.
[03:47:08.756 --> 03:47:10.717]  That it'll be a monumental failure.
[03:47:10.717 --> 03:47:14.578]  I urge everybody to do everything in their power, especially around the world.
[03:47:14.578 --> 03:47:17.698]  Make sure that that Copenhagen Conference is a failure.
[03:47:17.698 --> 03:47:18.859]  Again, gridlock.
[03:47:18.859 --> 03:47:20.079]  We want gridlock.
[03:47:20.079 --> 03:47:24.060]  That's the only possible outcome that saves humanity under these conditions.
[03:47:24.620 --> 03:47:27.783]  Now, the other thing is the dollar crisis that you mentioned.
[03:47:27.783 --> 03:47:30.426]  Today, the dollar is very weak.
[03:47:30.426 --> 03:47:31.226]  It's $1.50.
[03:47:31.226 --> 03:47:34.189]  It's more than $1.50 to buy a euro.
[03:47:34.189 --> 03:47:38.313]  That is very close to an all-time low, and it's certainly a 14-month low.
[03:47:38.313 --> 03:47:42.177]  The dollar index is below 75, which is quite dramatic.
[03:47:43.017 --> 03:47:48.660]  And at the same time, this is the kind of thing that gets you into the geometry of hyperinflation.
[03:47:48.660 --> 03:47:53.183]  You've got oil is up to almost $82 a barrel.
[03:47:53.183 --> 03:47:59.206]  So oil has gone up, well, certainly more than 10% just in the last five or six days.
[03:48:01.048 --> 03:48:04.451]  I think what you're heading for now is some kind of a dramatic moment.
[03:48:04.451 --> 03:48:11.717]  Hyperinflation takes off slowly, and then it gathers steam, and I'm afraid we're now in that kind of an area.
[03:48:11.717 --> 03:48:14.720]  One thing that I would warn against, the British.
[03:48:14.720 --> 03:48:26.350]  Remember that when you get a situation now of latent crisis, a crisis that is about to explode, the British specialty is to try to precipitate the crisis, to break it out in the open.
[03:48:26.890 --> 03:48:33.654]  In such a way that they can export the depression to others, to the US, to Europe, to Japan, whatever they can do.
[03:48:33.654 --> 03:48:43.941]  This Robert Fisk article in the London Independent has been, I think, characterized by the Ria Novosti news agency as a plant by George Soros.
[03:48:44.461 --> 03:48:51.742]  Designed to create a dollar panic and to prevent any rational form of monetary reform.
[03:48:51.742 --> 03:48:53.303]  It's just what the British do.
[03:48:53.303 --> 03:48:56.183]  They did it in 1931 when they went off gold.
[03:48:56.183 --> 03:48:59.264]  They did it in 1971 when they brought down Bretton Woods.
[03:48:59.264 --> 03:49:00.864]  They did it in 2007, 2008.
[03:49:00.864 --> 03:49:05.185]  They're trying to extort $6 billion from Iceland.
[03:49:05.185 --> 03:49:13.446]  So this does signify that the Anglo-American power elite are wanting to cause a global currency crisis now for a massive change?
[03:49:13.706 --> 03:49:15.147]  Yes, some of them are.
[03:49:15.147 --> 03:49:22.051]  Again, the more British side and the Wall Street side, but there may indeed be countervailing forces on that too.
[03:49:22.051 --> 03:49:30.516]  So look at the article by Vlad Grinkovic on Ria Novosti attacking Robert Fisk as essentially somebody who's a speaking tube for George Soros.
[03:49:31.156 --> 03:49:36.060]  Obviously, it is impossible for the dollar to remain as the sole reserve currency.
[03:49:36.060 --> 03:49:37.361]  That will not work.
[03:49:37.361 --> 03:49:42.926]  On the other hand, most of the other candidates for this are even less qualified.
[03:49:42.926 --> 03:49:47.430]  The euro, in the end, I think, are even less able to do this job than the dollar.
[03:49:47.430 --> 03:49:52.374]  And the worst of all possible worlds is this idea of a synthetic currency.
[03:49:52.374 --> 03:49:55.396]  The idea that you'd create a supernational currency.
[03:49:55.396 --> 03:49:59.880]  It would probably turn out to be special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund.
[03:50:00.260 --> 03:50:01.061]  That's the worst.
[03:50:01.061 --> 03:50:04.303]  That is what Lord Keynes wanted at Bretton Woods.
[03:50:04.303 --> 03:50:07.746]  Lord Keynes, of course, spokesman for British imperialism.
[03:50:07.746 --> 03:50:16.112]  He wanted this thing called Bancor, which would have been just a strangulation of world development instead of Bretton Woods.
[03:50:16.112 --> 03:50:18.214]  Bretton Woods worked very, very well.
[03:50:18.214 --> 03:50:26.120]  Between 1944 and 1941, 1971, we had the best rates of economic development in world history before or since.
[03:50:26.520 --> 03:50:32.709]  We should, I think, go back to the positive features of Bretton Woods, not all of them, but the ones that proved to work well.
[03:50:32.709 --> 03:50:41.643]  But certainly no Bancor, no special drawing rights, no supranational currency, and above all, watch out for British sabotage as this crisis gets worse.
[03:50:42.824 --> 03:50:57.789]  All right, I want to talk about how you see this unfolding on the current course that the establishment has us on, what some of those different forces that are moving towards world government and vertical integration, but maybe debating about who's going to be on top of the pyramid when this all settles.
[03:50:57.789 --> 03:51:01.130]  We'll talk about the final timeline and then launch Follow the Republic straight ahead.
[03:51:02.003 --> 03:51:09.534]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:51:09.534 --> 03:51:14.041]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:51:14.041 --> 03:51:17.366]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula
[03:51:17.526 --> 03:51:17.786]  I think so.
[03:51:37.328 --> 03:51:44.274]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[03:51:44.274 --> 03:51:49.779]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision dot com.
[03:51:49.779 --> 03:51:52.301]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.

[03:52:02.401 --> 03:52:06.426]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.426 --> 03:52:09.670]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:09.670 --> 03:52:14.456]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:14.456 --> 03:52:18.321]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[03:52:18.962 --> 03:52:20.842]  And they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:20.842 --> 03:52:26.043]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[03:52:26.043 --> 03:52:29.304]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:52:29.304 --> 03:52:36.145]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.145 --> 03:52:38.486]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:38.486 --> 03:52:40.086]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.086 --> 03:52:42.546]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:42.546 --> 03:52:44.667]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:44.667 --> 03:52:46.187]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[03:52:46.887 --> 03:52:49.809]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:49.809 --> 03:52:58.936]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:53:00.891 --> 03:53:04.773]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Calvin Soap.
[03:53:04.773 --> 03:53:14.936]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[03:53:14.936 --> 03:53:18.858]  Go to 5starsoaps.com or click on their link at infowars.com.
[03:53:18.858 --> 03:53:20.819]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:53:20.819 --> 03:53:24.320]  Calvin Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[03:53:24.640 --> 03:53:27.221]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[03:53:27.221 --> 03:53:32.404]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.
[03:53:32.404 --> 03:53:37.446]  Check out their whole line of bath, hair, laundry, and dish soap and more at 5starsoap.com.
[03:53:37.446 --> 03:53:42.348]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[03:53:42.808 --> 03:53:44.088]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:53:44.088 --> 03:53:52.891]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling toll-free 1-800-340-7091 or check them out online at 5starsoap.com.

[03:53:56.452 --> 03:53:57.393]  You're gonna love them.
[03:53:57.393 --> 03:53:59.013]  You will never use anything else again.
[03:54:07.836 --> 03:54:08.797]  Okay, here's the deal.
[03:54:08.797 --> 03:54:12.702]  PrisonPlanet.tv, you know, has been crashing all day because of so many people going there.
[03:54:12.702 --> 03:54:19.669]  I think the word got out it was free there or something, because it's thousands and thousands of times the members that we have.
[03:54:19.669 --> 03:54:21.592]  We can see the numbers just being bombarded.
[03:54:21.592 --> 03:54:23.474]  It may be a denial of service attack.
[03:54:23.474 --> 03:54:24.835]  Probably isn't.
[03:54:24.835 --> 03:54:26.657]  We'll be able to forensically tell you that later.
[03:54:27.802 --> 03:54:30.963]  I apologize to Tarpley, all this has been going on today when he was supposed to be on.
[03:54:30.963 --> 03:54:36.585]  I want to go ahead and set Tarpley up for another hour next week to talk more about the health care plan and where all that's really going.
[03:54:36.585 --> 03:54:44.068]  Before we go back to Webster here in closing, sometime in the next hour, we've got it where you can sign up now to be a member.
[03:54:44.068 --> 03:54:51.690]  If that took time to reroute that to where it could be on the new page we've got so PrisonPlanet.tv doesn't go down.
[03:54:51.690 --> 03:54:53.711]  In the next 30 minutes to an hour,
[03:54:56.750 --> 03:55:01.513]  It will be up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:55:01.513 --> 03:55:02.693]  It will be there premiering.
[03:55:02.693 --> 03:55:03.474]  I want to thank everybody.
[03:55:03.474 --> 03:55:05.835]  You can also get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:55:05.835 --> 03:55:07.976]  And it's up to you how big this is going to be.
[03:55:07.976 --> 03:55:11.979]  Tomorrow we'll be taking your calls, open phones, getting your response to the film.
[03:55:12.933 --> 03:55:16.074]  And all those that are holding, we'll have first-time callers again tomorrow.
[03:55:16.074 --> 03:55:17.114]  We'll put you to the front of the line.
[03:55:17.114 --> 03:55:22.615]  Before I get a final comment from Webster, I do have to thank some of the sponsors that made today's show possible.
[03:55:22.615 --> 03:55:24.095]  One of them is New Silver Solution.
[03:55:24.095 --> 03:55:27.196]  People all over the world are discovering the benefits of supernatural silver.
[03:55:27.196 --> 03:55:32.597]  This powerful new nanotechnology is a natural antibiotic and preventative against infections, germs, and diseases.
[03:55:32.597 --> 03:55:34.818]  They have all that information up on their site.
[03:55:35.838 --> 03:55:39.339]  Silver is one of the oldest natural antibiotics and is non-toxic.
[03:55:39.339 --> 03:55:44.980]  It goes on to say that to visit their link at InfoWars.com and see the studies for yourself.
[03:55:44.980 --> 03:55:46.241]  That's important.
[03:55:46.241 --> 03:55:47.881]  You can't afford to miss out on this opportunity.
[03:55:47.881 --> 03:55:52.802]  It's essential for your emergency preparedness needs and is a great way to protect you, your family, and your friends.
[03:55:52.802 --> 03:55:55.063]  You cannot put a price tag on your family's health.
[03:55:55.063 --> 03:55:57.163]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com today.
[03:55:57.163 --> 03:55:58.123]  That's one word.
[03:55:58.123 --> 03:56:00.444]  SupernaturalSilver.com today.
[03:56:00.444 --> 03:56:04.365]  Go there and also watch all the different testimonials at SupernaturalSilver.com.
[03:56:05.225 --> 03:56:06.125]  Come.
[03:56:06.125 --> 03:56:06.565]  Okay.
[03:56:06.565 --> 03:56:08.326]  Tarpley, we got three and a half minutes, sir.
[03:56:08.326 --> 03:56:14.768]  You've got the floor until we do the honors and launch Fall of the Republic at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:56:14.768 --> 03:56:18.629]  And there's always the best quality, low-tech DVDs we're shipping out.
[03:56:18.629 --> 03:56:19.649]  Again, I'm so excited.
[03:56:19.649 --> 03:56:20.289]  Get them.
[03:56:20.289 --> 03:56:20.929]  Make copies.
[03:56:20.929 --> 03:56:22.490]  Put them on AXS Television.
[03:56:22.490 --> 03:56:23.850]  Get them out to everybody.
[03:56:23.850 --> 03:56:26.671]  Webster, final comments about the state of the world and where we're going.
[03:56:27.748 --> 03:56:31.313]  Well, we're headed into a very severe dollar crisis.
[03:56:31.313 --> 03:56:34.317]  It probably has hyperinflationary overtones.
[03:56:34.317 --> 03:56:39.925]  The problem that we have is the system has now reached a state of such fragility
[03:56:40.754 --> 03:56:44.676]  That there are very little reserves left to deal with such a crisis.
[03:56:44.676 --> 03:56:46.558]  I mean, look at the Federal Reserve.
[03:56:46.558 --> 03:56:48.399]  They're down to 0%.
[03:56:48.399 --> 03:56:49.920]  They can't go any lower.
[03:56:49.920 --> 03:56:57.084]  And certainly the ability of the United States government to come up with another $700 billion to bail out banks is not there.
[03:56:57.084 --> 03:56:58.685]  So that can't be done anymore.
[03:56:59.905 --> 03:57:09.787]  We're now at a point where we've got this huge build-up of snow ready to form an avalanche, and any kind of an event can set it off.
[03:57:09.787 --> 03:57:11.507]  It won't be gradual.
[03:57:11.507 --> 03:57:13.688]  It will be a leap.
[03:57:13.688 --> 03:57:17.268]  In other words, it's going to be something quite dramatic once it starts going.
[03:57:17.268 --> 03:57:19.309]  By an order of magnitude?
[03:57:19.309 --> 03:57:20.049]  Well, huge.
[03:57:20.049 --> 03:57:22.710]  Bigger, bigger than September of 2008.
[03:57:22.710 --> 03:57:25.010]  In other words, now it's a dollar crisis.
[03:57:25.919 --> 03:57:29.983]  As well as an Anglo-American banking crisis, and indeed a world banking crisis.
[03:57:29.983 --> 03:57:37.070]  Because people should understand, when the dollar goes down, nobody remains invulnerable to that.
[03:57:37.070 --> 03:57:42.075]  Everybody is going to suffer greatly, and that includes China, India, and everybody else.
[03:57:42.075 --> 03:57:45.678]  Just think of the Chinese with their $2 trillion worth of U.S.
[03:57:45.678 --> 03:57:47.240]  Treasury bonds, as well as their
[03:57:47.961 --> 03:57:49.962]  Very foolish dependency on the U.S.
[03:57:49.962 --> 03:57:53.244]  market for all of their low-priced exports.
[03:57:53.244 --> 03:57:54.564]  This was not wise.
[03:57:54.564 --> 03:57:57.546]  So we're going to see a lot of mistakes that get paid for.
[03:57:57.546 --> 03:58:00.867]  But inside the U.S., again, I recommend gridlock.
[03:58:00.867 --> 03:58:02.648]  Fight the thing to a standstill.
[03:58:02.648 --> 03:58:06.270]  And then we're going to need, obviously, an anti-depression program.
[03:58:06.270 --> 03:58:08.611]  But there's nobody who represents that at the present time.
[03:58:08.611 --> 03:58:10.972]  So we've got to do more propaganda on that front.
[03:58:14.534 --> 03:58:17.475]  Well, Webster, great job breaking that down for us today.
[03:58:17.475 --> 03:58:22.395]  He's the author of two books on Barack Obama, available at Infowars.com.
[03:58:22.395 --> 03:58:23.616]  We really appreciate his work.
[03:58:23.616 --> 03:58:25.756]  He's a big part of Fall of the Republic.
[03:58:25.756 --> 03:58:30.137]  And all of you are a big part of this film coming to fruition and being released.
[03:58:30.137 --> 03:58:35.198]  And we're victims of our own success, but it'll be launching the next hour at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:58:35.198 --> 03:58:38.678]  It's like giving birth, and the doctor's about to show me the baby.
[03:58:38.678 --> 03:58:39.839]  This is very exciting.
[03:58:39.839 --> 03:58:40.719]  Thank everybody.
[03:58:40.719 --> 03:58:41.199]  Great job.
[03:58:43.496 --> 03:58:46.098]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.098 --> 03:58:51.744]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.744 --> 03:58:59.491]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[03:58:59.491 --> 03:59:05.576]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[03:59:05.576 --> 03:59:08.239]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[03:59:08.519 --> 03:59:14.806]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[03:59:14.806 --> 03:59:18.871]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[03:59:18.871 --> 03:59:24.237]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[03:59:24.477 --> 03:59:26.557]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[03:59:26.557 --> 03:59:28.318]  You need to look out for yourself.
[03:59:28.318 --> 03:59:30.838]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[03:59:30.838 --> 03:59:35.559]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[03:59:35.559 --> 03:59:39.280]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[03:59:39.280 --> 03:59:42.401]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[03:59:42.401 --> 03:59:44.301]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[03:59:44.301 --> 03:59:46.402]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[03:59:51.505 --> 03:59:56.976]  Direct from Austin, coast to coast, and in your face!
[03:59:56.976 --> 04:00:00.182]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
