[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.064]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.742 --> 00:00:15.383]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:17.104]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:18.945]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:20.386]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:22.048]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:26.311]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:31.014]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.777 --> 00:00:39.220]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.701]  Welcome.
[00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:41.162]  It's already the first...
[00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:44.216]  Brand new month spanning out before us.
[00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:54.803]  July, the month where the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776 against tyranny and King George.
[00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:57.385]  Welcome to another live edition.
[00:00:57.445 --> 00:00:59.707]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:02.889]  I'm going to launch straight into the news.
[00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:09.074]  Error of unborn mother looms as scientists use aborted fetuses...
[00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.349]  To grow human eggs.
[00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:15.890]  You see, they want to use the dead babies.
[00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.272]  They want to grow fetuses in utero, inside cows, so they can harvest larger organs.
[00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:33.894]  They want to use the fully formed eggs that are in the body of a baby they kill.
[00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:34.714]  The heart.
[00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:37.429]  We're good to go.
[00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:38.389]  We're good to go.
[00:02:06.044 --> 00:02:10.706]  For pedophiles and people that are alleged to be pedophiles.
[00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:13.727]  Also, blue spies for New York City.
[00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:17.589]  They're creating their own spy unit.
[00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.890]  Well, it's not their own spy unit.
[00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.851]  It's the CIA operating and publicly running the city.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.384]  We'll also get into Bush indicted over war crimes.
[00:02:30.424 --> 00:02:33.007]  That's the headline out of the Japan Times.
[00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:36.972]  A group of Japanese lawyers unveiled documents Monday indicting U.S.
[00:02:37.012 --> 00:02:46.703]  President George W. Bush for war crimes allegedly committed against the Afghan people since the United States-led coalition began its anti-terrorism campaign in Afghanistan in October of 2001.
[00:02:49.167 --> 00:03:00.291]  Well, yeah, any real Taliban or al-Qaeda were paid off and protected, but they would grab or show young people, old people off the street for torture and execution, and that's all admitted.
[00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:04.073]  Our own government admits people were, quote, tortured to death.
[00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:08.354]  Thousands were put in containers out in the sun for days.
[00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:09.935]  Most of them would die.
[00:03:10.015 --> 00:03:12.496]  Those that lived were lined up and machine-gunned.
[00:03:14.116 --> 00:03:18.318]  Out of the evening standard of London, controversy grows on vitamin ban.
[00:03:18.358 --> 00:03:27.202]  The EU has even banned over-the-counter vitamin C. They're now racing ahead to ban everything in the United Kingdom.
[00:03:27.802 --> 00:03:33.744]  So we'll be discussing that news for you here on the show today.
[00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:41.188]  And all of these articles are being posted on InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:48.404]  And one of the most chilling stories we have for you today, I'll cover first when we get back.
[00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:52.326]  Government's still napping as new 9-1-1 looms.
[00:03:52.526 --> 00:04:03.050]  New York Post, the official New World Order newspaper of New York, a frightening new report claims America is dangerously unprepared to cope with another terrorist attack like 9-1-1.
[00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:09.213]  The report of the Council on Foreign Relations contends the United States needs to spend another $98 billion
[00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:12.607]  To brace for an attack.
[00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:19.630]  And again, this is Gary Hart who said we need to use this disaster to get a new world order.
[00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:29.174]  Use this disaster to get what President Bush's father called for, I think only once, a new world order.
[00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:30.494]  No, he called for it over 220 times.
[00:04:32.927 --> 00:04:42.513]  So we'll get to what the CFR, almost said CIA, that's who they are, cryptically stated about destroying your liberties and freedom.
[00:04:43.594 --> 00:04:46.356]  Senate bill would alter line of presidential succession.
[00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:47.596]  Very serious article.
[00:04:48.657 --> 00:05:02.346]  This and a lot more all coming up right here on the Alex Jones Show where we talk about real issues that actually affect you and your family Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central and then back from 9 to Midnight.
[00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.711]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:08.293]  The Info War is straight ahead.
[00:05:09.214 --> 00:05:17.700]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.161]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:26.726]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:27.707]  We're good to go.
[00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.236]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.668]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:13.868 --> 00:06:18.295]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:22.802]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:22.862 --> 00:06:24.204]  The New World Order.
[00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:30.203]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:30.263 --> 00:06:37.190]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:39.393]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:39.713 --> 00:06:42.736]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[00:06:42.956 --> 00:06:50.143]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:50.323 --> 00:06:55.688]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:58.850]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:59.431]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:59.471 --> 00:06:59.971]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:01.273]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:14.885]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:23.072]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[00:07:23.292 --> 00:07:30.579]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:35.023]  Potassium iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:35.744]  We're good to go.
[00:07:58.983 --> 00:07:59.764]  Call toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:59.964 --> 00:08:00.865]  Call now and get free shipping.
[00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:01.145]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.941]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:27.001 --> 00:08:29.623]  It is July 1st, 2003.
[00:08:30.064 --> 00:08:31.925]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:49.139]  Top story today, the Council on Foreign Relations, the true House and Senate of the United States, the government, is telling us, brace for more terrorist attacks.
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.523]  The unofficial government, the shadow government,
[00:08:54.483 --> 00:09:04.312]  Organization, maintenance, regulation, executive arm is telling us brace for more attacks.
[00:09:04.432 --> 00:09:10.917]  New York Post today, government still napping as new 911 looms.
[00:09:10.977 --> 00:09:12.659]  Now let's analyze that first headline.
[00:09:13.965 --> 00:09:15.085]  The government's not napping.
[00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:16.426]  The borders are more open than ever.
[00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:17.766]  The liberties are being destroyed.
[00:09:18.106 --> 00:09:20.647]  The federalization of local police is taking place.
[00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:25.168]  The emergency alert system, the FEMA takeover system, is being put into high gear.
[00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:41.213]  They're bringing in foreign troops, signing extradition laws with foreign countries, unifying the global taxation system, setting up their new world order, invading sovereign nations, letting our troops get hit with depleted uranium, and saying you're not patriotic if you support the troops.
[00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:44.687]  That's what's really going on.
[00:09:44.747 --> 00:09:46.568]  Bush is going to sign the assault weapons ban.
[00:09:46.588 --> 00:09:47.548]  The list goes on and on.
[00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:48.909]  Now listen to this.
[00:09:48.929 --> 00:09:56.471]  A frightening new report claims America is dangerously unprepared to cope with another terror attack like 9-1-1.
[00:09:56.952 --> 00:10:12.457]  The report by the Council on Foreign Relations contends the United States needs to spend another, that's another, $98 billion to brace for an attack, a figure that the federal government of Homeland Security insists was grossly inflated.
[00:10:14.008 --> 00:10:15.370]  I believe in the next five years.
[00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:20.515]  Can't tell you when, where, what, or how that there will be an attack.
[00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:26.702]  Former Senator Warren Rudman, who chaired the panel that produced the report, told NBC's Meet the Press.
[00:10:28.023 --> 00:10:33.129]  And God forbid it's an attack with either chemical or biological or worse, some sort of nuclear device.
[00:10:33.209 --> 00:10:34.771]  We're not prepared to deal with that.
[00:10:35.416 --> 00:10:38.898]  This is a question of protecting the American people from unspeakable horror.
[00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:48.264]  The report says that in most cities, the police and fire heroes who would be on the front line lack vital equipment like breathing apparatus or even radios.
[00:10:48.664 --> 00:10:50.145]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:10:51.086 --> 00:11:04.334]  The cities, the counties, the states, and police and firemen, you know this better than anybody because you've seen it firsthand, you aren't getting emergency equipment, you aren't getting the masks, you aren't getting the mobile labs, you aren't getting things that would really defend
[00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.017]  It's all a bunch of smoke and mirrors.
[00:11:07.057 --> 00:11:17.522]  The funding is for prisons, the police state, surveillance, total information awareness network, the TIPS program, the talent program, anti-gun programs.
[00:11:18.503 --> 00:11:19.603]  It's a fraud, people.
[00:11:20.564 --> 00:11:21.244]  Now that's what they do.
[00:11:21.284 --> 00:11:26.927]  They always hold off funding and say it's for radios and ambulances, it's for potholes.
[00:11:27.548 --> 00:11:33.811]  They hold off funding for the most essential things and then say, oh, we need more funding.
[00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:40.971]  And then the feds say to their own CFR body, oh, $98 billion is grossly inflated.
[00:11:41.171 --> 00:11:42.451]  No, we're conservative.
[00:11:43.011 --> 00:11:45.873]  We only want $40 billion a year.
[00:11:45.893 --> 00:11:48.314]  $40 billion a year?
[00:11:48.334 --> 00:11:51.495]  $40 billion a year?
[00:11:52.035 --> 00:11:54.216]  Integrating the federal control into your communities?
[00:11:54.697 --> 00:11:58.678]  Bringing the military and the end of posse commentatus into your communities?
[00:11:58.898 --> 00:12:04.701]  That's the 1878 law barring the military from engaging in search and seizures and law enforcement activities against the public?
[00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:07.414]  Now listen to this.
[00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:15.500]  The report says that in most cities, the police and fire heroes who would be on the front line lack vital equipment like breathing apparatus and even radios.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.682]  It calls for a national 911 system.
[00:12:19.603 --> 00:12:21.104]  Ah, a national.
[00:12:21.144 --> 00:12:22.365]  See, federalizing.
[00:12:22.385 --> 00:12:27.109]  There's a bill introduced to federalize the cities publicly.
[00:12:27.609 --> 00:12:30.492]  It's in my analysis of Patriot Act II on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:31.704 --> 00:12:32.225]  We're good to go.
[00:12:45.638 --> 00:12:47.879]  And now we need a national 911 system.
[00:12:47.899 --> 00:12:49.580]  Well, that's the Amber Alert.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.301]  It's called EAS.
[00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:52.361]  I work in radio.
[00:12:52.781 --> 00:12:53.942]  Emergency Alert System.
[00:12:53.962 --> 00:12:54.742]  It is FEMA.
[00:12:54.822 --> 00:12:58.604]  It was put in in 96-97 by law.
[00:12:59.124 --> 00:13:01.945]  They told the stations we'll only take over for kidnapped children.
[00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:09.769]  Now they're taking over for hurricanes or tornadoes or report illegal guns or see how they mix in reasonable things with...
[00:13:10.436 --> 00:13:11.656]  Report illegal guns.
[00:13:11.716 --> 00:13:13.137]  Drink and drive, you go to jail.
[00:13:13.217 --> 00:13:14.237]  Better wear your ticket.
[00:13:14.637 --> 00:13:16.317]  Safety checkpoints ahead.
[00:13:16.638 --> 00:13:18.578]  These checkpoints are for your safety.
[00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:21.679]  It's incredible.
[00:13:21.859 --> 00:13:23.139]  This is the federalization.
[00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:25.700]  This is the command and control, the running man type system.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.441]  Rudman suggested that better equipment could have avoided the horrific loss of life in New York on September 11, 2001.
[00:13:32.901 --> 00:13:36.982]  And he goes on to talk about how their radios failed.
[00:13:37.022 --> 00:13:39.183]  Well, how dumb does Rudman think we are?
[00:13:39.972 --> 00:13:47.916]  The New York Daily News, the government has admitted last year that the radios of the firefighters didn't malfunction in one of the towers.
[00:13:48.856 --> 00:13:50.937]  They've been sealed under national security.
[00:13:51.017 --> 00:13:52.318]  Text of it has been leaked.
[00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.480]  And they were reporting that the fires were out and that there were bombs.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.921]  And then the bombs started going off.
[00:14:00.242 --> 00:14:05.566]  The firefighters have been told to shut up, and they tore down the wreckage and hauled it to Communist China.
[00:14:06.006 --> 00:14:14.412]  And the oldest firefighter publication in the country, an organization, Firefighter Engineering, says there's a cover-up, and those planes could not have done that.
[00:14:14.993 --> 00:14:24.340]  They don't care how many Discovery Channel and PBS Nova or Frontline specials you do about how the towers collapsed, we're not buying the fraud.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.081]  How did Building 7 collapse?
[00:14:26.101 --> 00:14:27.442]  It wasn't hit by an airplane.
[00:14:29.364 --> 00:14:30.405]  It continues, though.
[00:14:31.045 --> 00:14:41.630]  The council called for sending more federal preparedness money to probable targets like New York and share the spoils approach that was given while oming more money per capita.
[00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:55.756]  And it goes on to say that the council is a private advocacy group, and the Council on Foreign Relations is connected to the National Security Council, and it goes on and on and on.
[00:14:58.465 --> 00:15:01.666]  I mean, look, but then I tune into national talk shows.
[00:15:02.227 --> 00:15:10.970]  I monitor them when I'm doing errands in the morning, errands in the afternoon, errands in the evening, or when I'm working in the yard or cleaning out the garage.
[00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.391]  I will scan the AM dial, the FM dial.
[00:15:15.192 --> 00:15:27.877]  It's the same line, whether it's National Public Radio or Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity or Michael Savage, just a little bit, slightly different rhetoric, but the same basic move, and they will say on all these shows...
[00:15:28.812 --> 00:15:30.953]  The CFR does not exist.
[00:15:31.994 --> 00:15:34.235]  You are insane if you say it exists.
[00:15:34.295 --> 00:15:35.736]  There is no New World Order.
[00:15:36.597 --> 00:15:38.318]  There are no black helicopters.
[00:15:39.058 --> 00:15:40.779]  There is no move to globalism.
[00:15:41.239 --> 00:15:44.281]  And if you say it, you're an insane racist.
[00:15:46.342 --> 00:15:54.467]  And then I will simultaneously tune in to Sean Handy's show on Fox, and I will see CFR members on the show with CFR under their names.
[00:15:56.365 --> 00:16:13.310]  Limbaugh's book was published by the CFR imprint company, one of their subdivisions, and they say, and you've all heard them, your talk radio listeners, how many times have you heard them say, the CFR does not exist.
[00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:17.131]  The New World Order does not exist.
[00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:18.972]  Now, I harp on this a lot because...
[00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:31.206]  Well, I heard, I've been listening to talk radio the last couple weeks, and the neocons, who are the biggest liberals around, are all on the air saying, we found the mobile weapons labs.
[00:16:31.967 --> 00:16:32.927]  It's confirmed.
[00:16:33.007 --> 00:16:35.029]  We found the mass grave.
[00:16:35.129 --> 00:16:36.109]  It's confirmed.
[00:16:36.149 --> 00:16:38.711]  They tried to buy nuclear parts from Africa.
[00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:39.672]  It's confirmed.
[00:16:41.493 --> 00:16:45.476]  And they know that months ago it came out that all that was lies.
[00:16:45.996 --> 00:16:47.037]  Our government has admitted it.
[00:16:47.097 --> 00:16:48.258]  They don't care, folks.
[00:16:49.605 --> 00:16:57.310]  So, whereas CBS, NBC, CNN, they, five, six years ago, they had a policy of just blatant lying.
[00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:02.054]  I remember five, six years ago on talk radio, I would just cover their lies.
[00:17:02.114 --> 00:17:03.335]  That's what the show was about.
[00:17:03.755 --> 00:17:04.936]  How Wolf Blitzer lied.
[00:17:04.976 --> 00:17:06.277]  How Dan Rather lies.
[00:17:06.337 --> 00:17:08.678]  How the New York Times lies.
[00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.000]  And then I saw a shift.
[00:17:12.661 --> 00:17:15.563]  Away from lying in the dominant media, to throwing it in your face.
[00:17:15.823 --> 00:17:18.165]  Oh, the world government's so good, it's for your safety.
[00:17:19.511 --> 00:17:23.553]  The feds say they're going to remote control all your cars and control them for your safety, AP.
[00:17:25.373 --> 00:17:28.115]  People are being arrested if they say the N-word on the street.
[00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:29.275]  You know, thought crime.
[00:17:29.675 --> 00:17:32.096]  Whether you agree with that word or not, the point is it's the First Amendment.
[00:17:32.516 --> 00:17:33.637]  They just throw it in your face.
[00:17:34.017 --> 00:17:37.679]  Foreign tribes, we've signed deals to bring them in to, quote, deal with American terrorists.
[00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:45.602]  New York Daily News, AP, New York Post, they're building camps for your safety and there will be forced inoculation.
[00:17:47.114 --> 00:17:55.101]  All these things that we would read six, seven, eight years ago in government documents, cover on the air and be called kooks, the media, the dominant so-called liberal media, would lie.
[00:17:56.042 --> 00:17:58.404]  Five years ago, they shifted out of line.
[00:17:58.704 --> 00:17:59.905]  Before, it was 90% lies, 10% spin.
[00:17:59.925 --> 00:18:01.687]  Okay, on pertinent issues.
[00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:09.712]  They're telling the truth about football or baseball or how to bake a cake.
[00:18:09.932 --> 00:18:11.033]  It's not all lies.
[00:18:11.053 --> 00:18:12.894]  There's a lot of stuff in the news that's true.
[00:18:12.914 --> 00:18:14.175]  This plane crashed here.
[00:18:15.656 --> 00:18:17.137]  This person got run over there.
[00:18:17.657 --> 00:18:26.523]  But when it came to bills, what bills did, what legislation did, what a congressman really said, what a bill really does, it was 90% lies, 10% spin.
[00:18:27.204 --> 00:18:31.907]  Five years ago we saw the shift, and I've been talking about this since I saw the shift, to 90% spin, 10% lies.
[00:18:35.402 --> 00:18:38.205]  By spin, they tell the truth, but put a good spin on it.
[00:18:39.346 --> 00:18:45.491]  But five years ago, the conservative talk show hosts were building their trust with you.
[00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:49.715]  It was about 80% truth, 20% spin.
[00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.959]  Now, as soon as the liberal media switched into 90% spin, 10% lies, from 90% lies...
[00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:04.811]  Or 90% spin, 10% lies.
[00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:10.817]  As soon as they shifted, the neocons shifted to 90% lies, 10% spin.
[00:19:12.358 --> 00:19:17.863]  They're working as a team, folks, and they create this false reality, this illusion.
[00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.266]  I'm trying to break this down for you.
[00:19:21.787 --> 00:19:28.253]  So it's gotten to the point that they get on the air and they say, those are mobile weapons trucks, documented or not, admit it.
[00:19:29.142 --> 00:19:32.043]  Okay, they're pumping up helium balloons, or hydrogen balloons.
[00:19:32.623 --> 00:19:33.724]  Surveillance blimps.
[00:19:34.684 --> 00:19:36.885]  They even have the purchase orders from the British and the Russians.
[00:19:38.325 --> 00:19:40.166]  They say, yeah, they found mass graves.
[00:19:40.206 --> 00:19:43.247]  Turns out it was an exchange program for Iraqi and Iranian dead.
[00:19:43.287 --> 00:19:43.827]  That's admitted.
[00:19:43.847 --> 00:19:44.327]  They don't care.
[00:19:44.347 --> 00:19:45.127]  They're still announcing it.
[00:19:45.808 --> 00:19:50.569]  Turns out that the African country, Niger, did not sell nuclear parts to Iraq.
[00:19:51.129 --> 00:19:52.590]  The government created a false document.
[00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.050]  They don't care.
[00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.711]  They still say it's true.
[00:19:56.171 --> 00:19:58.412]  So, you know, now...
[00:19:59.384 --> 00:20:00.226]  I hear them on the air.
[00:20:00.286 --> 00:20:01.549]  There is no CFR.
[00:20:01.649 --> 00:20:03.072]  It does not exist.
[00:20:04.055 --> 00:20:05.297]  And you just lap it up.
[00:20:05.357 --> 00:20:07.542]  I mean, it's like saying the sun doesn't come up in the morning.
[00:20:07.562 --> 00:20:08.204]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:11.508 --> 00:20:16.010]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.432]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:20.732 --> 00:20:21.272]  We listened.
[00:20:21.592 --> 00:20:26.574]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:26.854 --> 00:20:27.335]  We listened.
[00:20:27.715 --> 00:20:30.756]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:31.716]  We listened.
[00:20:32.177 --> 00:20:35.338]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:20:35.578 --> 00:20:36.138]  We're good to go.
[00:21:02.074 --> 00:21:06.318]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:07.960]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:13.946]  I'm on the phone with Marilyn from Calvera, who's going to explain a little bit about this new diet.
[00:21:14.247 --> 00:21:15.268]  Marilyn, tell us about it.
[00:21:15.428 --> 00:21:17.670]  Well, it's a collagen protein supplement.
[00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.093]  It has collagen, aloe vera, and glycerin.
[00:21:20.293 --> 00:21:25.378]  You take three gel caps at night, and it helps build up some lean muscle, and it burns stored body fat.
[00:21:25.498 --> 00:21:26.739]  Wow, that sounds fantastic.
[00:21:26.779 --> 00:21:27.279]  How does it work?
[00:21:27.459 --> 00:21:29.660]  Well, because the collagen is the key.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.742]  When you take collagen on an empty stomach, it helps burn away that stored body fat.
[00:21:34.062 --> 00:21:38.864]  And it's really good for you because this product has no drugs, no stimulants of any kind.
[00:21:39.004 --> 00:21:40.905]  There's no special foods to eat.
[00:21:41.245 --> 00:21:43.206]  You simply take these three gel caps at night.
[00:21:43.486 --> 00:21:45.567]  That's your whole plan, and there's nothing more to it.
[00:21:45.667 --> 00:21:49.949]  But the average weight loss is a pant size a month with an 86% success rate.
[00:21:50.049 --> 00:21:52.610]  Marilyn, how can folks get a hold of you if they want to order Calvera?
[00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:53.791]  It's very simple.

[00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:05.800]  Well, Marilyn, that sounds fantastic.

[00:22:09.183 --> 00:22:09.823]  Okay, thanks.

[00:22:19.731 --> 00:22:20.132]  We're good to go.
[00:22:34.565 --> 00:22:34.945]  We're good to go.

[00:24:24.652 --> 00:24:26.233]  800-259-9231 on this 1st of July, 2003 Tuesday edition.
[00:24:37.817 --> 00:24:39.799]  Of the Alex Jones Show, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:40.740]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:24:42.402 --> 00:24:46.726]  I got into this fight ten years ago because I believed in conservative values.
[00:24:48.368 --> 00:24:57.417]  And I learned very quickly that the conservative leadership was more liberal than the liberals they spent all their time attacking.
[00:24:58.348 --> 00:24:59.949]  That they were Trojan horses.
[00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:05.370]  And as time goes on, I learn just how deep the treason, the treachery runs.
[00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:07.691]  But that's how an enemy attacks.
[00:25:07.731 --> 00:25:09.011]  They camouflage.
[00:25:09.691 --> 00:25:18.714]  That's how the American Indians would hunt buffalo was camouflaged as a wolf.
[00:25:19.594 --> 00:25:24.296]  This is basic 101 warfare, and somehow we've forgotten it.
[00:25:25.596 --> 00:25:28.037]  But we can't even have a debate about the CFR.
[00:25:28.948 --> 00:25:34.430]  Because the Ann Coulters of the world will get on the air and say it doesn't exist.
[00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:49.496]  I mean, I heard this lady on the talk radio last week, the big, beautiful, you know, Valkyrie saving us from the evil liberals, say that the Patriot Act doesn't take any of our rights, and the lying liberals are lying.
[00:25:49.596 --> 00:25:51.117]  Well, I've read the bill, lady.
[00:25:52.276 --> 00:25:57.040]  And the liberals, the Hillary Clintons, the Chuckie Schumers, voted for it.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.101]  So I don't want to hear it.
[00:25:58.361 --> 00:26:03.546]  They voted for your war to stop claiming it's a conservative war or a righteous war.
[00:26:04.867 --> 00:26:14.456]  But by putting a label on it, oh, this is conservative, conservatives got trained to trust the neocons at the critical point where they are now stabbing us in the back.
[00:26:15.837 --> 00:26:17.158]  And that's the point I'm trying to make.
[00:26:17.927 --> 00:26:34.515]  So we can't even have a discussion about CFR public documents where they say they're going to destroy America and set up a world tax and world army and take your liberties as they publicly say they're going to do it because the neocons get on the air and say it doesn't exist.
[00:26:35.435 --> 00:26:35.815]  It doesn't.
[00:26:35.835 --> 00:26:37.836]  It's like saying George Bush doesn't exist.
[00:26:37.876 --> 00:26:41.438]  It's like saying the Atlantic Ocean doesn't exist.
[00:26:43.527 --> 00:26:55.196]  I mean, here's the New York Post talking about the Council on Foreign Relations saying we better give up all our rights and have a national 911 system and federal control of our police department so the boogeyman's going to get us.
[00:26:56.697 --> 00:27:05.103]  And we've got Gary Hart at a CFR meeting days after 911 saying we need to use this disaster to get a new world order.
[00:27:07.105 --> 00:27:08.586]  Use this disaster to get a new world order.
[00:27:09.335 --> 00:27:16.803]  But you can't discuss a new world order because it's the talking points for the fake conservatives on talk radio to say there isn't a new world order.
[00:27:17.524 --> 00:27:32.479]  Some of the more sophisticated neocons, the supposedly really radical ones, you know, the guys that call for putting people that disagree with the government into FEMA camps, you all know who I'm talking about, they say we're fighting the new world order, we've got to give our rights up.
[00:27:33.211 --> 00:27:34.492]  We've got to do what Bush says.
[00:27:34.592 --> 00:27:36.333]  He's fighting the New World Order, see?
[00:27:36.773 --> 00:27:40.916]  So there's a more sophisticated flip-flop there using terms.
[00:27:42.777 --> 00:27:43.478]  It's amazing.
[00:27:43.518 --> 00:27:48.020]  So you better get past the rhetoric into what they're actually doing, not just what they're saying.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.762]  So here's the CFR saying brace for all these attacks.
[00:27:52.163 --> 00:27:56.546]  And now Bush is creating this six-plus billion, $6 billion,
[00:27:58.189 --> 00:28:06.452]  $300 million a year fund for forced inoculations for new vaccines to set up this bureaucracy.
[00:28:06.973 --> 00:28:09.133]  You're going, there's no such thing as forced inoculations.
[00:28:09.193 --> 00:28:11.574]  No, it's just been in 500 newspapers how good it is.
[00:28:13.915 --> 00:28:18.877]  Now they passed it in the Homeland Security package, page 76.
[00:28:19.017 --> 00:28:20.578]  Now they've got the new bio shield.
[00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:26.720]  They're going to build dozens and dozens of level 4 bioweapons labs in almost every major city.
[00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:36.735]  And right out in the open, it's funding for a massive bioweapons program, a massive launch of a new bioweapons development.
[00:28:36.755 --> 00:28:39.837]  That's what Jane's Weapons Encyclopedia says about it.
[00:28:40.097 --> 00:28:43.720]  They've put out a worldwide alert saying it's very dangerous and insane.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:54.066]  The average American listening to a neocon or just reading the dry spin in the Washington Post or the New York Post is going to read that it's O to keep you safe.
[00:28:55.911 --> 00:29:01.194]  And there won't really be any major press on it, so the average American will never understand what's happened in their area.
[00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:15.583]  By the way, the federal government two years ago went and dug up the Spanish flu, the influenza that killed 50 million people in 10 years, from 1910 to 1920, or 1914 to 1924, excuse me.
[00:29:20.971 --> 00:29:22.912]  Ten years of that major pandemic.
[00:29:23.052 --> 00:29:26.734]  It had shown up in 1910 in Asia, but took time to build up and spread.
[00:29:27.274 --> 00:29:45.161]  They dug it up out of frozen bodies in the tundra, and a lot of patriots and experts said this is going to be used for a new plague, a new fear-based system, a new way to get you to take inoculations, to set up this new bureaucracy for the feds to put in your body what they want, when they want.
[00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:48.463]  And now I have an article today, and we'll talk about it when we get back,
[00:29:49.358 --> 00:29:52.802]  They say brace for the new bioweapon influenza.
[00:29:52.882 --> 00:29:53.923]  It's going to hit us.
[00:29:54.503 --> 00:29:56.646]  The CFR says give all your rights up.
[00:29:56.706 --> 00:29:57.687]  Maybe you'll be safe.
[00:29:58.007 --> 00:29:59.308]  Oh, but the CFR doesn't exist.
[00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:01.611]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:03.693]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.614 --> 00:30:07.317]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.367 --> 00:30:13.388]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:30:13.708 --> 00:30:18.630]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.111]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate.
[00:30:22.311 --> 00:30:24.352]  That's 888-601-7546.
[00:30:24.932 --> 00:30:26.473]  Well, Marilyn, that sounds fantastic.
[00:30:26.633 --> 00:30:29.694]  We'll check back with you a little bit later to learn more about this exciting new product.
[00:30:29.854 --> 00:30:30.514]  Okay, thanks.
[00:30:32.395 --> 00:30:35.116]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:30:35.136 --> 00:30:38.997]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:42.745 --> 00:30:47.690]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[00:30:49.011 --> 00:30:51.634]  We do this show live.
[00:30:51.654 --> 00:30:55.077]  And then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:30:55.117 --> 00:30:56.839]  Your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:30:57.597 --> 00:31:01.280]  The total free number to join us on air on this Tuesday, the 1st of July, 2003, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:07.424]  So, the Council on Foreign Relations is saying here in the New York Post that we are sure to be hit by terrorists.
[00:31:07.444 --> 00:31:08.604]  We've got to take...
[00:31:23.477 --> 00:31:28.080]  The federal system and accept the takeover for our security.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.061]  That's the line that Hitler used.
[00:31:32.222 --> 00:31:39.946]  And at the same time, these are the same guys that put out the report six months before 9-1-1 saying we will be hit by terrorists.
[00:31:39.986 --> 00:31:41.126]  Give all your rights up.
[00:31:41.506 --> 00:31:42.827]  Accept the new world order.
[00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:44.188]  That's word for word, by the way.
[00:31:45.296 --> 00:31:46.396]  But it's for your safety.
[00:31:47.057 --> 00:31:53.679]  And now they put out a new report saying brace for it, you're going to get it unless you submit to the New World Order.
[00:31:54.719 --> 00:32:02.222]  We need to accept this, the New World Order, as the solution, they say, to all of our problems.
[00:32:03.482 --> 00:32:12.425]  And now the headline of the Sydney Morning Herald, flu could be next terror weapon, warns scientists.
[00:32:14.426 --> 00:32:16.227]  Forget anthrax and smallpox.
[00:32:16.287 --> 00:32:20.609]  Influenza could easily be turned into the next weapon of mass destruction.
[00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:33.876]  Scientists said today they sounded their warning as researchers come close to completing the blueprint for the virus of the 1918 flu epidemic that killed up to 40 million.
[00:32:33.896 --> 00:32:35.417]  Well, the numbers I've seen say 50.
[00:32:36.177 --> 00:32:37.838]  Up to 40 million people globally.
[00:32:38.487 --> 00:32:54.960]  Taken together with the fact that influenza virus is readily accessible and may be causing more deaths than previously suspected, the possibility for genetic engineering and aerosol transmission suggests an enormous potential for bioterrorism, the University of Texas scientists said.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.561]  Here's the problem.
[00:32:58.337 --> 00:33:08.707]  The Australian government just last year put out a blueprint for taking a type of smallpox in mice and weaponizing it for humans that kills 100% of the people that come in contact with it.
[00:33:09.368 --> 00:33:14.373]  It's the globalists that have the world population control policies, including Australia's, that are public.
[00:33:15.734 --> 00:33:21.180]  It is the globalists that say they're going to use bioterror to re-engineer our society, the threat of bioterror.
[00:33:22.794 --> 00:33:38.925]  Writing in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, the team led by Dr. Mohamed Majid noted that last century, a series of flu epidemics from Spain to Russia and Hong Kong had killed millions of people as the virus naturally mutated.
[00:33:40.446 --> 00:33:50.093]  They pointed out that sequencing of the genome of the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic was nearly complete, opening the door to unscrupulous scientists to build an even more
[00:33:50.894 --> 00:33:51.995]  Potent virus.
[00:33:52.335 --> 00:33:53.915]  Oh, I'm sure you'll make that public, too.
[00:33:54.696 --> 00:33:56.276]  Our government went and dug it up, folks.
[00:33:57.037 --> 00:34:06.561]  Recently, the possibility of synthesizing an infectious agent solely by following instructions from a written sequence has moved from theory to practice, they wrote.
[00:34:07.201 --> 00:34:15.605]  The scientists also noted that while infection generally took place through personal contact, the disease was also easily transmittable through tiny droplets in the air.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:25.026]  A would-be bioterrorist needed only a spray, an aerosol containing the weaponized virus inside a passenger plane to set off a global infection.
[00:34:25.366 --> 00:34:33.852]  They pointed out that in contrast to agents such as smallpox, which was carefully guarded, the flu virus was relatively freely available.
[00:34:34.633 --> 00:34:44.900]  It had the added advantage that because it occurred naturally, the beginning of a purposely started outbreak would not set off alarm bells, giving the disease a major head start on people trying to fight it.
[00:34:45.341 --> 00:34:45.821]  Noting that
[00:34:46.534 --> 00:34:54.356]  It's appeal to bioterrorists also lay in the effect that it had a short incubation period and did not succumb to post-exposure immunization.
[00:34:54.796 --> 00:34:58.437]  The scientists set out a list of demands for urgent action.
[00:34:58.838 --> 00:35:00.378]  There should be more immunization.
[00:35:00.638 --> 00:35:13.802]  They said laboratory security should be raised, antiviral drugs should be stockpiled, there should be closer monitoring of outbreaks, and government should consider fitting filters and sensors to buildings.
[00:35:14.002 --> 00:35:14.262]  So...
[00:35:16.335 --> 00:35:29.862]  Just in the U.S., 6.3 billion a year building giant bioweapons plants all over the country to counter a crisis that, believe me, they're going to give you.
[00:35:31.042 --> 00:35:33.403]  To, again, expand the bureaucracy even more.
[00:35:33.563 --> 00:35:44.749]  It is a bureaucracy where they inject in your body what they want, when they want, and if you don't take their deadly vaccines that are altering DNA, implanting cancer viruses...
[00:35:46.156 --> 00:35:48.979]  Hormones added to attack brain development in children.
[00:35:49.699 --> 00:35:52.341]  Tetanus shots with hormones added to sterilize.
[00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:53.722]  They've been caught doing all this.
[00:35:54.983 --> 00:36:00.908]  If you don't take their shots, then you say you're going to die due to all the new super illnesses.
[00:36:01.489 --> 00:36:13.619]  And what big pharma giant could help itself not to release a bioweapon and then to have the drugs and the vaccines in the wings to treat it and to then charge exorbitant prices?
[00:36:14.312 --> 00:36:25.221]  Then out of the crisis that would be set up, the society would be trained to accept a highly controlled, manipulated society with quarantines and shutdowns of cities.
[00:36:26.022 --> 00:36:31.746]  This is their blueprint for total dehumanization and enslavement.
[00:36:33.588 --> 00:36:43.136]  We told you two and a half years ago when they dug up the dead bodies near the North Pole with people that were frozen, who had been buried and remained frozen.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:59.592]  For the last 90 years, they went into their lung tissue, removed the mutated influenza, which many believe was bioengineered, a bioweapon, an early bioweapon, and now they're going to publish the genome for the super flu.
[00:36:59.692 --> 00:37:00.613]  Isn't that nice?
[00:37:01.093 --> 00:37:07.178]  Just like the folks in Australia published the new super smallpox vaccine,
[00:37:08.227 --> 00:37:15.389]  ...information out of the mouse pox that will kill anyone and everyone, 100% kill rates.
[00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:33.915]  And they save race for this, and they're setting up a bureaucracy, a 6.3 billion bioweapons development system with level 4 bioweapons labs all over the country, and a huge health department bureaucracy federalized for forced injection, and they're already training the police, the military...
[00:37:34.965 --> 00:37:39.347]  And the firefighters and the EMS workers to forcibly inject you.
[00:37:41.067 --> 00:37:51.491]  The good news is, 99.99 out of 10 million people, 296 have taken it as of a few months ago, a year into the program.
[00:37:52.531 --> 00:37:55.513]  Four people out of 20,000 in the state of Connecticut, according to the AP.
[00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:56.853]  I've given you those numbers many times.
[00:37:57.773 --> 00:38:02.155]  They're refusing wholesale because the scientists who weren't in government employ said, wait a minute.
[00:38:03.712 --> 00:38:08.734]  A lot of prestigious scientists said, wait a minute, smallpox, this doesn't protect us against weaponized smallpox.
[00:38:09.395 --> 00:38:11.736]  And the shot's more dangerous than the disease.
[00:38:11.996 --> 00:38:16.818]  And it's not really airborne unless somebody coughs right in your face.
[00:38:17.598 --> 00:38:19.419]  It's a slow plotter, they said.
[00:38:19.859 --> 00:38:21.040]  Why do you want us to take this?
[00:38:21.778 --> 00:38:26.401]  And they heard about all the health risks and what happened to the troops who took the anthrax shots.
[00:38:26.481 --> 00:38:27.622]  They've seen these troops.
[00:38:28.062 --> 00:38:41.150]  And the troops that took the smallpox shots, they've seen the autoimmune diseases, the hair falling out, 200-pound men, solid muscle, who can run marathons six months later in a coffin weighing 75 pounds.
[00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:45.092]  And so they've said no.
[00:38:45.813 --> 00:38:47.474]  Now, I'm not trying to scare you folks.
[00:38:47.534 --> 00:38:49.795]  It's the CFR in the New York Post today.
[00:38:50.755 --> 00:38:51.276]  Comments...
[00:38:52.225 --> 00:38:57.788]  Made by Senator Warren Rudman, head of the panel with Gary Hart on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday.
[00:38:58.888 --> 00:39:02.230]  The CFR that Limbaugh says doesn't exist.
[00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.170]  If you talk about it, you're a kook.
[00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:07.572]  Well, here they are saying brace for all this.
[00:39:09.353 --> 00:39:16.716]  And now they've got a new bill where the states, the governors of the states will appoint the new members of Congress.
[00:39:18.277 --> 00:39:20.658]  And they've got a new bill where Reg moves in
[00:39:21.454 --> 00:39:26.938]  To the ascension past others in the cabinet in a continuity of government system.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:34.903]  They are setting up a dictatorship, my friends, and they want a constitutional convention.
[00:39:35.884 --> 00:39:43.549]  And in that con-con, now being promoted by the neocon Trojan horse forces, they can rewrite all the bills and legislation.
[00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.152]  They can change the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:39:48.837 --> 00:39:49.537]  Senate bill.
[00:39:49.597 --> 00:39:50.397]  Here's a new bill.
[00:39:50.457 --> 00:39:51.258]  It's not a con-con.
[00:39:51.278 --> 00:39:51.858]  It's another bill.
[00:39:51.898 --> 00:39:54.838]  Senate bill would alter the line of presidential succession.
[00:39:54.898 --> 00:40:11.882]  Fox News Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge could move up to eighth in the line of presidential succession, leapfrogging ten other cabinet members in a congressional effort to better prepare for a catastrophic attack on Washington.
[00:40:12.614 --> 00:40:26.157]  Under legislation approved by the Senate and now pending in the House, Ridge would move from 18th to 8th behind Attorney General John Ashcroft in front of Interior Secretary Gail Norton in the line to succeed the President in disaster.
[00:40:26.177 --> 00:40:29.537]  The measure sped through the Senate without debate last Friday.
[00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:39.079]  Ridge asked about legislation and said, Monday, one of our responsibilities, obviously, is continuity of government and where the Congress thinks the Secretary should fit.
[00:40:39.779 --> 00:40:40.740]  That's their judgment.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.400]  I'm satisfied with it
[00:40:43.112 --> 00:40:59.543]  Current system dates back to Presidential Succession Act of 47, signed by President Truman that specifies the Vice President, Speaker of the House, the President, Pro Tem, and the Senate for the Secretary of State are next in line to take over the presidency if necessary.
[00:40:59.603 --> 00:41:04.366]  Other cabinet members are listed according to their date their offices were established.
[00:41:05.647 --> 00:41:08.289]  Let's talk to Ron in New York and Paul in Florida and others.
[00:41:08.469 --> 00:41:09.270]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:09.750]  Go ahead.
[00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.151]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:18.580]  With reference to the thing on the CFR I've been hearing for the last 24 hours over the ABC News Network, they keep quoting the CFR.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:31.346]  Now, I found that strange because the CFR is a private self-appointed organization, yet they are made to appear as though the ultimate and final authority on all that is wise and good for national foreign policy of the United States.
[00:41:31.826 --> 00:41:33.247]  Well, there's 2,400 members of the CFR set up in 1922.
[00:41:37.305 --> 00:41:42.371]  Chartered publicly to overthrow sovereignty and bring us into the global empire.
[00:41:43.051 --> 00:41:50.299]  Their stated public documents say they want a one world government, no liberties or freedoms, global tax, regulation, gun confiscation.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.303]  But the neocons say the CFR doesn't exist.
[00:41:54.323 --> 00:41:55.084]  Did you know that?
[00:41:55.324 --> 00:41:57.787]  What gets to me is that they'll come across the airwaves.
[00:41:58.399 --> 00:42:03.783]  The mainstream news media will project them out as though this is the premier authority on what we should do.
[00:42:03.803 --> 00:42:07.446]  These people are not even elected or even appointed by elected officials in the country.
[00:42:07.466 --> 00:42:09.107]  But they are the government.
[00:42:09.968 --> 00:42:12.530]  They are the puppeteers behind the puppet that we call our government.
[00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:14.091]  And then there's bigger puppets above them.
[00:42:14.111 --> 00:42:19.134]  But the chairman and the heads of the CFR are also Bilderberg, bilateral commission members.
[00:42:19.595 --> 00:42:21.636]  Full of strength on our government.
[00:42:21.696 --> 00:42:27.741]  And the CFR is a mechanism in between, it's I guess various levels, organizations like the CFR,
[00:42:28.263 --> 00:42:30.824]  Are they one step down, and then our government is one step below that?
[00:42:30.844 --> 00:42:31.624]  Let me tell you what they are.
[00:42:31.664 --> 00:42:45.789]  They're the heads of all the major media, the heads of all major academia, the heads of banking, government, as I said, finance, most of the big religious leaders are CFR members, and they publicly say that it's a secret group.
[00:42:45.969 --> 00:42:48.950]  They put out some publications, but what they say behind closed doors is a secret.
[00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:54.652]  Elected officials at the highest levels are all members, and they come out and call for a new world order.
[00:42:55.453 --> 00:43:01.156]  And tell us to give up our liberties, and they say they're the bosses on the news now, and then Rush Limbaugh says they don't exist.
[00:43:02.177 --> 00:43:06.879]  Well, the American people had better wake up, because this is not a government.
[00:43:07.419 --> 00:43:08.600]  It is not an elected group.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.841]  They're in no way, shape, or form democratic.
[00:43:11.301 --> 00:43:15.884]  And yet we have to take their word like it was the word of the living God about what's going to happen.
[00:43:15.944 --> 00:43:18.045]  Since when should they be able to, or do they?
[00:43:18.732 --> 00:43:28.458]  Well, that shows their arrogance now, Ron, that five years ago we saw the shift.
[00:43:28.679 --> 00:43:32.881]  Bill Clinton gave the first big public speech to the CFR.
[00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:39.446]  Remember, it was live on TV in the middle of the day where he apologized and said, yeah, I did the thing with Monica Lewinsky.
[00:43:39.966 --> 00:43:42.908]  He said, I want to thank David Rockefeller for saving my presidency.
[00:43:43.692 --> 00:43:49.096]  He goes, I want to thank my mother and David Rockefeller, the two that have always cared, because he's an illegitimate Rockefeller.
[00:43:50.797 --> 00:43:51.918]  This is on TV, folks.
[00:43:52.618 --> 00:43:55.220]  And then after that, CFR, CFR.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:59.963]  But see, the neocons have got a problem, because they always said the CFR didn't exist.
[00:44:00.484 --> 00:44:03.366]  But now it's so out in the open, what are they saying now?
[00:44:03.406 --> 00:44:05.207]  I don't listen now as much as I did.
[00:44:05.507 --> 00:44:07.629]  Well, they're not denying their existence.
[00:44:07.709 --> 00:44:12.192]  In fact, in some cases, they're inviting them on to their neocon TV talk shows.
[00:44:12.717 --> 00:44:15.399]  But I'm talking about Neocons and Talk Radio.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.702]  They say it's the cook detector if you believe there's a CFR.
[00:44:19.163 --> 00:44:25.709]  Oh, they were saying that maybe back in the 90s, but now they're just like quietly allowing them to slip in to come to the fore.
[00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:26.990]  That's the way it is.
[00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:36.879]  In other words, projecting them out as some credible and legitimate entity, as though it was an elected entity, that can make determinations and opinions that we should abide by and adhere to.
[00:44:37.659 --> 00:44:40.260]  You know, this is thick, and I've got to say something, too.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:44.362]  I'm sorry, but I have to criticize the mass known as the American people.
[00:44:44.962 --> 00:45:00.168]  Are they so deluded in their Babylonian taste, their perverted TV shows, their recreational drug use, their meaningless sports, and the rest of it, that they're just sitting back, a larger portion of them, quietly, and allowing their humanity?
[00:45:00.508 --> 00:45:03.789]  We've gone beyond, and we're going to go beyond usurping your constitutional rights.
[00:45:04.289 --> 00:45:05.850]  They're going to usurp your
[00:45:09.772 --> 00:45:11.833]  Sounds like your cell phone cut out, sir.
[00:45:11.933 --> 00:45:12.754]  It's not a cell phone.
[00:45:13.054 --> 00:45:14.194]  Oh, it's a call waiting, then.
[00:45:14.514 --> 00:45:16.275]  No, no, it's not a call waiting, no.
[00:45:16.355 --> 00:45:17.436]  Somebody else came on.
[00:45:17.476 --> 00:45:20.537]  I think your screener accidentally put somebody else in.
[00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:22.738]  But this is what's going on.
[00:45:22.778 --> 00:45:25.800]  The American people have to act like men and women.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.242]  We have to realize we just can't party away like this.
[00:45:29.862 --> 00:45:32.263]  A friend of mine has told me, we had a state route.
[00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:39.874]  Going through the state where I live to a rural area where I originally came from, which has recently become an interstate route.
[00:45:40.114 --> 00:45:46.498]  You know, you were talking about how the federal government gives funds and subsumes things and federalizes things.
[00:45:46.558 --> 00:45:47.519]  Here's a perfect example.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.920]  It goes to a small town.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.361]  I used to drive that road many times.
[00:45:51.401 --> 00:45:54.563]  You wouldn't really get molested or harassed unless you genuinely broke the law.
[00:45:55.163 --> 00:46:00.967]  My friend who lives up there has told me now there are people in the community and people traveling through not from that community
[00:46:01.451 --> 00:46:04.034]  We aren't really breaking any law, road rule whatsoever.
[00:46:04.555 --> 00:46:05.636]  They're being pulled over.
[00:46:06.137 --> 00:46:06.917]  They're being searched.
[00:46:07.038 --> 00:46:07.618]  It's constant.
[00:46:07.658 --> 00:46:15.367]  My friend told me it's so bad now, he can't even step a mile away from his front door without going down that road without being stopped for nothing at all.
[00:46:16.168 --> 00:46:16.869]  Where are you going?
[00:46:16.889 --> 00:46:18.151]  Where are you going to?
[00:46:18.251 --> 00:46:19.072]  Where are you coming from?
[00:46:19.676 --> 00:46:21.517]  I mean, this guy was coming from the doctor's office.
[00:46:21.557 --> 00:46:24.718]  He has to tell a state trooper that he's getting medical treatment.
[00:46:24.798 --> 00:46:26.779]  But the border is going to stay wide open.
[00:46:26.819 --> 00:46:27.479]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:27.799 --> 00:46:28.139]  Okay.
[00:46:28.459 --> 00:46:29.960]  And you don't have to tell them anything.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:30.740]  That's right.
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:31.641]  Keep that in mind.
[00:46:31.881 --> 00:46:32.161]  All right.
[00:46:32.201 --> 00:46:33.601]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:34.162 --> 00:46:35.162]  Appreciate the call.
[00:46:35.902 --> 00:46:36.923]  Really do appreciate the call.
[00:46:36.943 --> 00:46:45.446]  We're going to come back and talk to Paul and others on the other side of this break and get into this other big stack of vital news and information.
[00:46:45.466 --> 00:46:47.787]  But bottom line, terrorists have taken over the government.
[00:46:48.433 --> 00:46:51.734]  They're using terror to get control of our society and poses our saviors.
[00:46:52.254 --> 00:46:53.315]  And it is disgusting.
[00:46:54.075 --> 00:47:00.638]  Folks, if you want to find out the mindset of world leaders, you need to get my video, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:47:01.698 --> 00:47:03.719]  I snuck into the grove three years ago.
[00:47:04.798 --> 00:47:09.140]  Coming up on three years, July 15th, I caught world leaders engaging in their bizarre rituals.
[00:47:09.221 --> 00:47:09.761]  It's admitted.
[00:47:09.781 --> 00:47:11.602]  It's aired on national television.
[00:47:12.022 --> 00:47:16.525]  You need to get Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove, two hours and five minutes long.
[00:47:16.545 --> 00:47:23.649]  You need to get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, covering how the globalists carried out September 11th and where they're going in the future and how to stop them.
[00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:30.472]  Very important you get this film and make a lot of copies and give them out to everybody you know, folks, or it's over for this country.
[00:47:30.512 --> 00:47:31.493]  We've got to back them off.
[00:47:32.553 --> 00:47:35.835]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement covers Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[00:47:36.295 --> 00:47:38.656]  Dozens of examples of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:47:39.236 --> 00:47:40.316]  It goes on and on.
[00:47:40.376 --> 00:47:41.437]  You need these videos.
[00:47:41.977 --> 00:47:47.839]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.920]  Big discounts when you get three or more.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.921]  They drop down from $25.95 to $20 apiece.
[00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:51.681]  I got nine films.
[00:47:55.106 --> 00:47:55.466]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:47:55.486 --> 00:47:56.287]  Write it down, folks.
[00:47:56.527 --> 00:47:57.588]  Make the call.
[00:47:57.608 --> 00:47:58.689]  Support the broadcast.
[00:47:58.709 --> 00:47:58.789]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:47:58.809 --> 00:47:59.370]  Don't wait.
[00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.950]  Get the video.
[00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.991]  Stand up for America.
[00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:01.071]  888-253-3139.

[00:48:02.292 --> 00:48:02.633]  We'll break.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.226]  Come back and take more calls and cover more news.
[00:48:26.326 --> 00:48:28.049]  You'll definitely want to stay with us.
[00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.731]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:31.511 --> 00:48:33.293]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:48:33.473 --> 00:48:39.118]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:48:39.438 --> 00:48:40.299]  Probably never, right?
[00:48:40.579 --> 00:48:43.642]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.
[00:48:43.902 --> 00:48:46.344]  He's the owner and founder of the Cal Bend Soap Company.

[00:49:27.532 --> 00:49:30.375]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:49:32.094 --> 00:49:36.556]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:49:36.916 --> 00:49:41.018]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:41.298 --> 00:49:41.859]  We listened.
[00:49:42.159 --> 00:49:47.141]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:47.421 --> 00:49:47.901]  We listened.
[00:49:48.282 --> 00:49:51.323]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:51.743 --> 00:49:52.283]  We listened.
[00:49:52.744 --> 00:49:55.625]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[00:49:55.725 --> 00:49:56.425]  We're good to go.
[00:50:22.641 --> 00:50:26.882]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:50:27.123 --> 00:50:28.563]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:50:31.264 --> 00:50:38.666]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:50:38.926 --> 00:50:43.668]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:50:43.888 --> 00:50:49.530]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:54.294]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:50:54.515 --> 00:51:01.682]  The casual society control grid, impalpable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:01.702 --> 00:51:05.125]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[00:51:06.386 --> 00:51:08.909]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:09.129 --> 00:51:15.896]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:16.096 --> 00:51:21.341]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:21.361 --> 00:51:21.782]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:36.397 --> 00:51:38.298]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:38.778 --> 00:51:41.599]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:51.322]  Coming up, I want to discuss the big news story over in Europe.
[00:51:51.642 --> 00:51:54.123]  Error of unborn mother looms.
[00:51:54.503 --> 00:51:56.944]  That's error of unborn mother looms.
[00:51:57.665 --> 00:52:02.526]  The scientists use aborted fetuses to grow human eggs in them.
[00:52:03.547 --> 00:52:04.407]  They also want to grow...
[00:52:05.313 --> 00:52:20.241]  The babies, not kill them, take them and implant them in cows' uterus, grow them up larger, attach organs to them, do DNA cultures, grow different tissues, turning little children who they're not going to kill.
[00:52:20.641 --> 00:52:24.563]  They're going to keep them alive inside cows.
[00:52:25.786 --> 00:52:29.248]  Oh, but I'm an evil liberal because I'm against it.
[00:52:29.668 --> 00:52:31.489]  Conservatives are for abortion.
[00:52:31.569 --> 00:52:33.249]  Conservatives are for gun control.
[00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:35.530]  Conservatives are for New World Order.
[00:52:36.611 --> 00:52:38.292]  See how they control both sides of the coin?
[00:52:39.192 --> 00:52:46.055]  That's coming up, and we'll go to Paul and Bob here momentarily, and others that are patiently holding second and third hours straight ahead.
[00:52:47.396 --> 00:52:55.139]  But I do want to just briefly invite you again to get my films, folks, and my book, The Sententary, that covers September 11th, the definitive work on it
[00:52:55.882 --> 00:52:58.843]  Concentrated information in 230 pages, only $12.
[00:52:58.883 --> 00:53:07.645]  9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny, and then I have Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, two films that cover September 11th, very well produced.
[00:53:08.185 --> 00:53:09.326]  Please get the videos.
[00:53:09.466 --> 00:53:16.488]  Please make copies of them, hundreds of copies of them, for not-for-profit, not-for-sale educational purposes.
[00:53:16.588 --> 00:53:18.068]  Please air them on AXIS TV.
[00:53:18.168 --> 00:53:21.749]  Please wake people up to the facts of the takeover.
[00:53:22.668 --> 00:53:36.634]  You can write to me at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704 or 888-253-3139.
[00:53:36.674 --> 00:53:37.675]  Don't procrastinate, folks.
[00:53:38.095 --> 00:53:39.836]  Paul in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:53:39.856 --> 00:53:40.496]  Thanks for holding.
[00:53:42.437 --> 00:53:48.360]  Do you have the whole recording for the John Ashcroft speech about you will lose your rights, your liberties?
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:49.980]  Yes.
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.301]  Is that a long speech?
[00:53:51.889 --> 00:53:53.050]  Yeah, it's about an hour long.
[00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:53.510]  Really?
[00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.711]  Do you concentrate on that, just that?
[00:53:57.292 --> 00:54:01.454]  He said that there is no rights being taken.
[00:54:01.554 --> 00:54:03.935]  Patriot Act 1 doesn't affect citizens.
[00:54:04.095 --> 00:54:08.017]  Charges of shredding the Constitution and kangaroo courts are lies.
[00:54:08.537 --> 00:54:11.459]  If you say this, you're aiding terrorists, and you will lose your liberty.
[00:54:12.419 --> 00:54:15.340]  So he says, we're not taking your liberty, but if you say we are, we'll take yours.
[00:54:16.041 --> 00:54:20.123]  And then he comes out and says, okay, it does affect citizens, and there is Patriot Act 2.
[00:54:21.164 --> 00:54:26.059]  So we have the whole chronology now of the different flip-flopping and lies.
[00:54:26.099 --> 00:54:27.262]  But he's done it all publicly.
[00:54:27.723 --> 00:54:28.526]  Is that on your tape?
[00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:31.227]  The whole thing, John Ashcroft?
[00:54:31.428 --> 00:54:33.689]  Well, no, not the whole hour of his speech.
[00:54:34.029 --> 00:54:34.790]  The highlights?
[00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:45.177]  Yeah, we have Ashcroft saying in 2001 that Patriot Act I doesn't take liberties, doesn't affect citizens, and we have all the news articles in the subsections where it does.
[00:54:45.738 --> 00:54:50.101]  Then we have Ashcroft saying there's no Patriot Act II showing the actual bills.
[00:54:50.601 --> 00:54:52.783]  Since the film came out a month ago...
[00:54:53.641 --> 00:54:58.327]  He then, like a week after it came out, he went before Congress, said there is a Patriot Act 2.
[00:54:58.828 --> 00:55:02.333]  The Justice Department issued a brief and said it does affect all citizens.
[00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:04.095]  It will be used in all crimes.
[00:55:04.155 --> 00:55:05.357]  And that was in the Washington Times.
[00:55:05.657 --> 00:55:09.302]  The actual quotes out of the brief to Congress from the Justice Department.
[00:55:09.713 --> 00:55:14.500]  The digging up the bodies for the Spanish flu, is that on your website, or do you have that also on that tape?
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:25.536]  I would type in federal government excavates at the North Pole or in Alaska for Spanish flu victims.
[00:55:26.269 --> 00:55:27.750]  That was about two and a half years ago.
[00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:30.991]  We covered that extensively, and now they've dug it up.
[00:55:31.091 --> 00:55:33.011]  It's mentioned in the article today.
[00:55:33.531 --> 00:55:37.753]  So, yes, it is on my website today, and they're saying brace to be hit by it.
[00:55:38.433 --> 00:55:39.533]  Let me find the article here.
[00:55:39.573 --> 00:55:40.494]  I'm trying to dig it out.
[00:55:42.514 --> 00:55:44.095]  Oh, here it is, Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:55:44.795 --> 00:55:47.476]  Flu could be next terror weapon, warns scientist.
[00:55:48.596 --> 00:55:53.938]  And it goes on to talk about how they dug it up again, and now they say it's about to attack you.
[00:55:55.299 --> 00:55:56.519]  How's that sound to you, Paul?
[00:55:56.919 --> 00:55:57.499]  It's terrible.
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.120]  Mr. Jones, I want to thank you very much for fighting the battle, and please hang in there.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:01.680]  Don't give up.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.001]  Hey, I won't, sir.
[00:56:03.041 --> 00:56:03.901]  I appreciate you.
[00:56:03.981 --> 00:56:05.481]  Listen, we don't have a choice.
[00:56:05.521 --> 00:56:06.321]  We're under attack.
[00:56:06.761 --> 00:56:08.442]  You serve them, you fight them, you're under attack.
[00:56:08.622 --> 00:56:11.882]  The best thing to do for our families and our country is to fight this.
[00:56:11.922 --> 00:56:15.363]  There shouldn't even be a question.
[00:56:16.123 --> 00:56:17.784]  This is do or die.
[00:56:18.364 --> 00:56:19.504]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:28.105]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:56:28.805 --> 00:56:39.994]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.626 --> 00:56:48.286]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.946 --> 00:56:50.027]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:51.827]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.468 --> 00:56:53.288]  You want answers?
[00:56:54.048 --> 00:56:54.969]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:59.250]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:03.912]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:08.593 --> 00:57:13.035]  Already into the second hour of this July 1st, 2003 show.
[00:57:14.708 --> 00:57:16.929]  Live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:16.969 --> 00:57:20.310]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 p.m.
[00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:22.190]  Central, 11 in the morning to 2 p.m.
[00:57:22.231 --> 00:57:24.831]  in the afternoon, and then back from 9 to midnight.
[00:57:24.851 --> 00:57:27.312]  That's 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:57:27.332 --> 00:57:35.755]  We go out on the AM and FM dial, simulcast on the Internet at InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:36.497 --> 00:57:39.201]  And global shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20, and at night at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:57:46.633 --> 00:57:50.775]  We're about to go to Michael and Phil and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:57:50.815 --> 00:57:54.297]  If you'd like to join us on air today, the number is 800-259-9231.
[00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:54.537]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:57:54.597 --> 00:57:56.779]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:57:56.979 --> 00:57:59.400]  There is so much that we need to get to.
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:04.983]  Again, last hour I talked about how the government dug up the dead bodies of people that were frozen.
[00:58:15.942 --> 00:58:17.063]  We're good to go.
[00:58:17.103 --> 00:58:17.483]  We're good to go.
[00:58:44.305 --> 00:58:45.786]  It's all coming up.
[00:58:46.127 --> 00:58:48.629]  A bunch of news on gun confiscation in Canada.
[00:58:48.649 --> 00:58:51.291]  A bunch of corruption news out of Iraq.
[00:58:51.351 --> 00:58:52.111]  It's all coming up.
[00:58:53.112 --> 00:59:01.999]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to, well, I guess Bob in Florida is up next, and Michael, Phil, and others.
[00:59:02.079 --> 00:59:02.859]  Bob, you're on the air.
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:03.300]  Go ahead.
[00:59:04.781 --> 00:59:05.401]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:59:05.582 --> 00:59:06.162]  Pretty good, sir.
[00:59:06.642 --> 00:59:13.908]  Hey, I wanted to talk to the listeners and yourself about warnings that we received from our Founding Fathers
[00:59:15.131 --> 00:59:18.692]  Okay, and the demonization of our founding fathers in the media.
[00:59:19.012 --> 00:59:25.614]  Well, why do you think FEMA teaches that George Washington was an un-American terrorist, that all Christians are enemies of FEMA?
[00:59:26.534 --> 00:59:27.655]  Two particular points.
[00:59:28.355 --> 00:59:42.019]  Ken Burns, documentary filmmaker, jazz, American history, Civil War, did a piece on Jefferson, and also there was a movie called Jefferson in Paris,
[00:59:42.748 --> 00:59:48.830]  The only thing that these guys always focus on is slave owner.
[00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:55.031]  Continuously they focus on the fact that Thomas Jefferson was a slave owner.
[00:59:55.631 --> 00:59:59.753]  They never go into the details of what the guy was really saying.
[01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:03.413]  Warning us about the banking establishment rising up.
[01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.254]  The same for Washington.
[01:00:05.274 --> 01:00:08.915]  He said, you know, if you let the government issue money
[01:00:09.591 --> 01:00:19.054]  Corporations will rise up and surround you, and your sons and daughters will find themselves homeless in the land that they grew up.
[01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:34.080]  Now, I've got to say that on another subject, there's a website, a nonprofit organization called the Foundation for Advancement of Monetary Education, fame.org.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.241]  There they have a notable quote about money.
[01:00:37.918 --> 01:00:56.550]  There's where all our founding fathers are warning us, and several characters throughout history, of what happens when you allow, you know, it's amazing because the Federal Reserve Act, Congress empowers a private entity, the Federal Reserve Banking System, with powers it doesn't even have in the first place.
[01:00:57.130 --> 01:01:03.754]  I highly recommend, if you can get him on, Alex, Dr. Edwin Vieira from FAME or Larry Parker,
[01:01:05.077 --> 01:01:07.518]  I think we've had Larry on.
[01:01:07.738 --> 01:01:08.058]  Have you?
[01:01:08.559 --> 01:01:17.122]  Yeah, it's just unbelievable how they demonize these guys, and I hope we get some quotes up there from them.
[01:01:18.302 --> 01:01:19.983]  All right, anything else you'd like to add?
[01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:20.703]  No, thank you.
[01:01:20.823 --> 01:01:21.424]  Have a good day.
[01:01:21.624 --> 01:01:22.664]  All right, excellent points.
[01:01:22.824 --> 01:01:24.225]  Yeah, we've had corruption.
[01:01:24.265 --> 01:01:27.566]  We've had corrupt individuals taking over our government for a long time.
[01:01:28.386 --> 01:01:32.428]  Now they want to individually enslave you and set up a prison-style economy.
[01:01:33.251 --> 01:01:33.851]  They're doing.
[01:01:34.052 --> 01:01:34.952]  They've said they're doing.
[01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:36.593]  They're out in the open doing.
[01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:40.796]  Do you have the courage, the forethought to admit it and do something about it?
[01:01:40.816 --> 01:01:41.316]  More coming up.
[01:01:43.428 --> 01:01:46.989]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:01:47.249 --> 01:01:48.669]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:01:49.149 --> 01:01:50.590]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:56.031]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:01:56.391 --> 01:02:00.852]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:02:01.172 --> 01:02:09.814]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:02:10.334 --> 01:02:11.475]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:02:11.935 --> 01:02:15.718]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:02:15.978 --> 01:02:22.603]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:02:22.943 --> 01:02:26.986]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[01:02:27.406 --> 01:02:29.388]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[01:02:29.648 --> 01:02:30.408]  Call toll-free 800-569-4340.
[01:02:30.428 --> 01:02:30.769]  That's 800-569-4340.
[01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:32.250]  Or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:46.870]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:51.475]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:55.999]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:02:56.059 --> 01:02:57.401]  The New World Order.
[01:02:59.182 --> 01:03:03.403]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:03:03.464 --> 01:03:10.407]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:03:10.527 --> 01:03:12.588]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:03:12.928 --> 01:03:23.312]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:03:23.532 --> 01:03:24.753]  If you want to understand what the new...
[01:03:24.753 --> 01:03:24.953]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:24.973 --> 01:03:26.314]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:03:43.721 --> 01:03:47.343]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[01:03:47.503 --> 01:03:51.885]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:03:52.085 --> 01:03:56.527]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[01:03:56.727 --> 01:03:59.689]  There are no moving parts, and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:04.591]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[01:04:04.891 --> 01:04:08.713]  Made of the finest materials, it has a 2-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[01:04:09.013 --> 01:04:11.394]  And the Aaronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[01:04:11.694 --> 01:04:15.574]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[01:04:15.795 --> 01:04:21.016]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds, and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[01:04:21.216 --> 01:04:24.136]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[01:04:24.316 --> 01:04:26.177]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[01:04:26.397 --> 01:04:29.038]  For more information about the Aaronizer, call Toll Free.
[01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:31.038]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[01:04:31.258 --> 01:04:32.339]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:32.359 --> 01:04:33.819]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:33.839 --> 01:04:34.360]  Thomas Paine.
[01:04:57.708 --> 01:05:10.218]  Thomas Paine, one of our founding fathers, said, Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world as well as property.
[01:05:10.999 --> 01:05:18.144]  Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived the use of them.
[01:05:19.485 --> 01:05:25.190]  Again, now you know why we have FEMA on tape to a group of police, and they do it all over the country, saying, quote,
[01:05:25.737 --> 01:05:28.378]  Thomas Jefferson, George Washington are terrorists.
[01:05:28.998 --> 01:05:30.759]  All Christians are terrorists.
[01:05:32.099 --> 01:05:35.481]  Their training manuals say homeschoolers, gun owners.
[01:05:36.081 --> 01:05:39.622]  UNESCO says the family must be destroyed publicly.
[01:05:40.882 --> 01:05:42.243]  This is your government, folks.
[01:05:44.044 --> 01:05:53.347]  Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world as well as property.
[01:05:54.188 --> 01:05:59.050]  Horrid mischief would ensue, or the law abiding deprive the use of them.
[01:06:00.291 --> 01:06:02.032]  Look at England right now.
[01:06:02.072 --> 01:06:02.892]  They take all the guns.
[01:06:02.932 --> 01:06:06.714]  Their crime rate's now the highest of any industrialized country, from one of the lowest.
[01:06:07.314 --> 01:06:09.695]  Switzerland issues automatic weapons to every man.
[01:06:09.755 --> 01:06:11.456]  Women can have them, plastic explosives.
[01:06:12.217 --> 01:06:14.178]  Lowest crime rate, no bombings, no nothing.
[01:06:15.958 --> 01:06:17.119]  Australia takes the guns.
[01:06:17.159 --> 01:06:18.079]  Crime rates explode.
[01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:19.640]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.361]  Here's a couple other quotes for you.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:27.824]  The time to guard against corruption and tyranny is before they shall have gotten hold of us.
[01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:36.210]  It is better to keep the wolf out of the fold than to trust to drawing his teeth and talons after he has entered.
[01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:40.272]  Thomas Jefferson notes to Virginia.
[01:06:42.734 --> 01:06:45.816]  And then I've got another quote here that I wanted to read.
[01:06:45.936 --> 01:06:47.857]  And I've got this from the UN website.
[01:06:48.398 --> 01:06:50.039]  Food is power.
[01:06:51.235 --> 01:06:53.937]  We use it to change behavior.
[01:06:54.537 --> 01:06:56.198]  Some may call that bribery.
[01:06:56.698 --> 01:06:58.919]  We do not apologize.
[01:07:00.921 --> 01:07:08.305]  Catherine Brannini, UN World Food Program Executive Director, 1997.
[01:07:09.386 --> 01:07:10.826]  Food is power.
[01:07:11.507 --> 01:07:13.248]  We use it to change behavior.
[01:07:13.708 --> 01:07:15.129]  Some may call that bribery.
[01:07:15.209 --> 01:07:16.670]  We do not apologize.
[01:07:19.187 --> 01:07:20.548]  Yeah, we know what you do to our food.
[01:07:20.588 --> 01:07:23.029]  The fluoride, the aspartame, the poisons.
[01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:26.071]  We know what you do.
[01:07:27.972 --> 01:07:28.892]  We know what you're about.
[01:07:28.932 --> 01:07:31.474]  We know you're genetically engineering all the major food crops.
[01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:39.858]  Then Monsanto and others have their own courts, their own federally created courts that rule against everyone and take over the farms and ranches.
[01:07:41.519 --> 01:07:44.561]  Your propaganda is so good, you've got the farmers thanking you for it.
[01:07:45.703 --> 01:07:49.326]  Let's go to Mike in Florida, then Phil, Phil, and others.
[01:07:49.846 --> 01:07:50.807]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:07:50.867 --> 01:07:51.228]  Welcome.
[01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:55.311]  Go ahead, Mike in Florida.
[01:07:55.331 --> 01:07:56.012]  You're on the air.
[01:07:57.893 --> 01:07:59.034]  Okay, is Mike not there?
[01:07:59.054 --> 01:08:01.236]  Alex, Alex, can you hear me?
[01:08:01.276 --> 01:08:02.277]  Go ahead.
[01:08:02.337 --> 01:08:05.359]  I just want to start off by first saying that I'm a long-time listener.
[01:08:05.519 --> 01:08:06.140]  I love your show.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.361]  I think you're doing a great job.
[01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:12.485]  I think you're really putting up a good fight, and I think a lot of people should strive to be as proactive as you.
[01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:13.806]  Do me a favor.
[01:08:13.866 --> 01:08:14.627]  Turn the radio off.
[01:08:15.222 --> 01:08:15.562]  Yes, sir.
[01:08:15.602 --> 01:08:18.963]  Give me one second.
[01:08:18.983 --> 01:08:19.563]  Hold on.
[01:08:21.164 --> 01:08:21.624]  Okay.
[01:08:21.924 --> 01:08:22.584]  I apologize, Alex.
[01:08:22.784 --> 01:08:23.425]  That's all right.
[01:08:23.985 --> 01:08:26.085]  Now, go ahead.
[01:08:26.906 --> 01:08:29.627]  But like I was saying, I really think I'm a big fan of yours in general.
[01:08:29.927 --> 01:08:32.868]  But I really wanted to bring up a couple issues.
[01:08:32.928 --> 01:08:37.129]  I think that lately the things with Harry Potter and the J.K.
[01:08:37.169 --> 01:08:43.631]  Rowling and some of the other stuff, the thing with Eric Rudolph being part of the NWO, I really think that some of that stuff
[01:08:45.337 --> 01:08:51.361]  I think it kind of gives Pro and the people to discredit us because I really don't think Eric Rudolph has anything to do with the NWO.
[01:08:52.141 --> 01:08:58.344]  I mean, I really don't see how his bombings would in any way, shape, or form move forward their plan.
[01:08:58.824 --> 01:09:02.286]  Okay, let's take that first issue.
[01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:04.247]  The second issue you raised first, okay?
[01:09:04.267 --> 01:09:05.028]  Yes, sir.
[01:09:05.888 --> 01:09:09.290]  What I said is, from all the evidence...
[01:09:10.603 --> 01:09:11.043]  Yes, sir.
[01:09:11.123 --> 01:09:11.424]  Yes, sir.
[01:09:11.464 --> 01:09:12.985]  You know why they did that?
[01:09:30.745 --> 01:09:40.550]  Because Richard Jewell said he saw a particular individual leave a satchel, and Richard Jewell tried to warn people and save some lives.
[01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:45.773]  And from the evidence I've gotten, the guests I've had on, the BATF carried out that bombing, sir.
[01:09:46.673 --> 01:09:48.334]  They get more funding every time that happens.
[01:09:48.975 --> 01:09:52.096]  We have the BATF on tape bragging.
[01:09:52.156 --> 01:09:53.777]  It's in the Rules of Engagement.
[01:09:54.998 --> 01:09:59.140]  The Emmy award-winning film, Academy-nominated,
[01:10:01.235 --> 01:10:04.896]  Saying with their cameras, oh, we're going to get a lot of funding with this raid.
[01:10:05.256 --> 01:10:15.358]  They trained for six months at Fort Hood with the Green Berets to go in there and open fire and, quote, kill a bunch of cult members and make it look good to the cameras because they were coming up for funding.
[01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:16.998]  And they did get an increase in funding, by the way.
[01:10:17.618 --> 01:10:21.639]  So we know they carry out bombings and raids to get more funding.
[01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:27.360]  Now, they also tried to frame some other guy the FBI did for the Olympic Park bombing, had to drop that.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.348]  Witnesses saw people other than Rudolph there planting the bombs.
[01:10:32.388 --> 01:10:35.694]  That's been in the newspapers, but you never hear it on the national news.
[01:10:36.355 --> 01:10:36.796]  Okay?
[01:10:37.638 --> 01:10:40.342]  So I don't believe anything they do.
[01:10:42.369 --> 01:10:43.489]  I'm grabbing a news article.
[01:10:43.509 --> 01:11:03.916]  Did you hear me read last week, headline, Chief of Police, Texas Justice Unfair, Urges Crime Lab Court Inquiry, the Chief of Police of San Antonio, of Houston, this is the Houston Chronicle, Tuesday, June 24, 2003, says they're framing people, says they don't care if you're innocent or guilty, they just want to win cases.
[01:11:05.076 --> 01:11:06.757]  I read the quotes over and over again.
[01:11:07.569 --> 01:11:09.931]  I read the article three or four times last week.
[01:11:10.731 --> 01:11:13.033]  The Tulia case in Texas.
[01:11:13.673 --> 01:11:14.734]  46 people arrested.
[01:11:14.814 --> 01:11:15.474]  No drugs.
[01:11:15.554 --> 01:11:17.656]  No paraphernalia found.
[01:11:17.956 --> 01:11:18.956]  No criminal records.
[01:11:18.996 --> 01:11:20.397]  They get 20 to 90 years.
[01:11:20.657 --> 01:11:22.058]  They're all convicted.
[01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:27.082]  They go to jail and it turns out the cops knowingly lied and didn't care.
[01:11:27.402 --> 01:11:29.203]  They just wanted to get their federal quota.
[01:11:30.689 --> 01:11:34.910]  So you sit there and you go, you find it hard to believe, and I'm glad you called.
[01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:35.631]  Stay there, Mike.
[01:11:36.471 --> 01:11:41.372]  You say you find it hard to believe that I think the government carried out the abortion bombings?
[01:11:41.392 --> 01:11:45.794]  Let me tell you what was happening in the mid-'90s and late-'90s.
[01:11:47.414 --> 01:11:55.997]  Their Operation Rescue and others were shutting down almost every abortion clinic in the country.
[01:11:57.350 --> 01:12:00.113]  They were sitting there peaceably on videotape.
[01:12:00.153 --> 01:12:02.515]  The police from L.A.
[01:12:02.615 --> 01:12:03.075]  to St.
[01:12:03.135 --> 01:12:04.737]  Louis would break their arms.
[01:12:04.777 --> 01:12:07.279]  They would take the nightsticks, twist their arms in handcuffs.
[01:12:07.659 --> 01:12:14.745]  I have Catholic priests and Protestant preachers having their arms broken, women holding their babies on the sidewalk, being sprayed in the face with mace.
[01:12:14.786 --> 01:12:15.726]  I've heard this on TV.
[01:12:15.806 --> 01:12:16.907]  I have footage of this.
[01:12:18.169 --> 01:12:18.989]  And it didn't matter.
[01:12:19.069 --> 01:12:22.232]  The nonviolent protest was bringing them to their knees.
[01:12:22.292 --> 01:12:24.214]  The cops were trying to refuse and stop.
[01:12:26.284 --> 01:12:39.795]  And it was massive, and then suddenly there's bombings, and then Reno says, because of this, I'm saying it's organized crime, you can't be within hundreds of feet, even on public streets, with signs or protesting, we'll put you in prison for life.
[01:12:40.275 --> 01:12:46.660]  I have friends that were standing on a street corner with a sign, spent five years in jail, veterans with no criminal record.
[01:12:47.001 --> 01:12:51.865]  The feds, I believe, from all the evidence, now they've got their conspiracy theory, I've got mine.
[01:12:52.405 --> 01:12:53.506]  I don't speculate a lot.
[01:12:54.088 --> 01:12:56.910]  But on this, I say I don't trust them.
[01:12:57.131 --> 01:12:57.971]  I don't believe them.
[01:12:58.071 --> 01:12:59.012]  They have the motive.
[01:12:59.332 --> 01:13:00.894]  They've carried out attacks before.
[01:13:01.374 --> 01:13:04.657]  They tried to frame Richard Jewell, who saw the BATF on the scene.
[01:13:05.217 --> 01:13:06.098]  I don't trust them.
[01:13:06.158 --> 01:13:07.039]  Now, do you understand that?
[01:13:07.719 --> 01:13:08.079]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:08.119 --> 01:13:08.560]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.924]  I mean, I agree with you, I mean, in most parts, but I just don't see as, like, lately with, like, I don't see what J.K.
[01:13:13.964 --> 01:13:16.386]  Rowling and the Harry Potter books, I mean, really.
[01:13:16.406 --> 01:13:18.628]  Have you ever been in a giant satanic meeting?
[01:13:19.509 --> 01:13:20.129]  No, sir, I haven't.
[01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.930]  Well, I have been.
[01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:22.171]  Okay?
[01:13:22.191 --> 01:13:22.371]  Okay.
[01:13:23.391 --> 01:13:27.252]  I've been a stone's throw from world leaders worshipping Moloch.
[01:13:29.013 --> 01:13:41.817]  Now, what's happened in the culture is they took the occult, put it in red pajamas and with little black horns and said it's an Anton LaVey deal, it's this kooky thing, weirdos talk about it.
[01:13:42.537 --> 01:13:50.360]  The fastest growing religion, according to the FBI, according to Scotland Yard, is the satanic elite, is Satanism.
[01:13:51.095 --> 01:13:58.057]  They're having major arrests of public figures engaged in satanic murder cults from Belgium to France to Portugal right now.
[01:13:58.077 --> 01:13:58.617]  Did you know that?
[01:13:59.498 --> 01:14:00.158]  No, sir, I did not.
[01:14:00.438 --> 01:14:01.458]  And it's not like it's a rumor.
[01:14:01.498 --> 01:14:03.079]  They're digging the dead babies up, sir.
[01:14:03.099 --> 01:14:07.440]  Do you know what the summer solstice is?
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:09.821]  I know it's sort of Wiccan.
[01:14:09.901 --> 01:14:11.421]  It's a Wiccan sacred day.
[01:14:12.562 --> 01:14:15.843]  Yeah, well, that's when they released the Harry Potter book.
[01:14:16.623 --> 01:14:18.124]  So you think that's a purpose thing?
[01:14:18.264 --> 01:14:19.364]  They do it every year.
[01:14:20.652 --> 01:14:23.074]  The little kids dress up like witches and dance around.
[01:14:23.114 --> 01:14:26.776]  The book teaches you how to get into the occult with magical thinking.
[01:14:27.456 --> 01:14:28.637]  It leads you into it.
[01:14:29.578 --> 01:14:31.299]  I mean, it's hidden in plain view, sir.
[01:14:31.319 --> 01:14:38.604]  Did you know that cattle mutilations, horse mutilations, dog-cat mutilations are spreading everywhere?
[01:14:38.964 --> 01:14:42.166]  There are satanic sacrifices that they catch every year in this country.
[01:14:43.663 --> 01:14:45.924]  No, I didn't, but now you're saying that J.K.
[01:14:45.984 --> 01:14:47.425]  Rowling is involved.
[01:14:47.805 --> 01:14:53.809]  I don't believe that when she wrote the book, I don't believe she has any idea what the globalists are or anything about, I don't believe she's a Satanist.
[01:14:54.469 --> 01:15:09.757]  Sir, all the terms, the potter and all this, it gets into famous occultists, the names, the way it's set up, they've got to kill the unicorn, the innocent sweet thing, that's the sacrifice of the baby, the snake.
[01:15:11.099 --> 01:15:12.760]  Going around telling him what to do.
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:17.881]  I mean, sir, and Rowling said the books get deeper and darker as it goes.
[01:15:18.961 --> 01:15:22.042]  Well, then what you're saying, and pretty much that J.K.
[01:15:22.082 --> 01:15:28.984]  Rowling herself, then, must be at least a Satanist or some kind of pagan or a Wiccan of some sort because she's reading these subliminal messages.
[01:15:29.104 --> 01:15:30.744]  Well, it's not subliminal, sir.
[01:15:30.764 --> 01:15:32.805]  Well, overt messages, then.
[01:15:33.145 --> 01:15:33.785]  Overt messages.
[01:15:34.898 --> 01:15:35.818]  Messages.
[01:15:36.719 --> 01:15:41.040]  Look, our president got in a black coffin and worshipped Lucifer.
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.201]  I can see him doing that.
[01:15:45.201 --> 01:15:45.861]  He's a bad man.
[01:15:46.101 --> 01:15:55.124]  Well, sir, look, remember two years ago, two and a half years ago, it came out, they got the video of the courtyard ceremony at Skull and Bones?
[01:15:55.564 --> 01:15:56.364]  Yes, yes, I remember.
[01:15:56.484 --> 01:16:01.225]  Did you see ABC News, Fox News, and they showed it and said it's no big deal, they're just having fun.
[01:16:01.505 --> 01:16:03.466]  Yeah, the president does this, but they're just having fun.
[01:16:04.128 --> 01:16:07.911]  Men walk out in druid hoods, say, we worship you, Satan, give us power.
[01:16:08.792 --> 01:16:14.177]  Women kneel down, they slit their throats, blood sprays, but they claim it was an effigy, a simulation.
[01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:21.283]  And then a guy comes out dressed like the devil with horns and says, come into the underworld, be born again into my brotherhood.
[01:16:22.384 --> 01:16:27.829]  Now, if I was doing that, I told my church I was doing that, you think they'd want me as a member of the church?
[01:16:28.489 --> 01:16:28.950]  Probably not.
[01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:30.891]  Okay, well, how is he the...
[01:16:32.089 --> 01:16:33.231]  It's all in plain view.
[01:16:33.271 --> 01:16:34.693]  The kids dressed up like witches.
[01:16:34.993 --> 01:16:36.716]  Most of the cartoons are about witchcraft.
[01:16:36.876 --> 01:16:37.837]  The president involved.
[01:16:37.857 --> 01:16:39.079]  You go, oh, it's just fun.
[01:16:39.099 --> 01:16:40.741]  That's the devil's biggest trick.
[01:16:40.761 --> 01:16:41.342]  We'll be right back.

[01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:49.052]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:49.732 --> 01:20:52.134]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:20:53.394 --> 01:20:55.055]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:55.075 --> 01:20:58.197]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:20:58.217 --> 01:21:00.338]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:21:00.418 --> 01:21:01.239]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:21:01.299 --> 01:21:04.100]  Please tell a friend today about the show.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.722]  Remember today you listened to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:08.081 --> 01:21:12.747]  I don't want to spend a lot more time on this, Mike, because I've got Phil and Phil and Mark and many others that are holding.
[01:21:13.428 --> 01:21:25.042]  But going back to you, look, it's weird when the Washington Times and Parade Magazine and the Sacramento Bee say that truckloads of male prostitutes are brought in for the Bohemian Grove members.
[01:21:25.882 --> 01:21:28.283]  Okay, but that's not Alex Jones, it's the Washington Times.
[01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:40.767]  It's weird when they show video on ABC nightly news of satanic sacrifices, say it's a mock sacrifice, and admit the president was involved in it, but say, oh, they're just having fun, what's the big deal?
[01:21:40.787 --> 01:21:41.927]  That's what Peter Jennings said.
[01:21:42.567 --> 01:21:46.728]  They're throwing it in your face, and then I'm weird for reporting it.
[01:21:47.409 --> 01:21:51.850]  Now, would you not trust your neighbor if they were in the backyard doing rituals?
[01:21:53.391 --> 01:21:54.491]  I think you'd be concerned.
[01:21:54.631 --> 01:21:54.771]  Well...
[01:21:55.717 --> 01:21:56.797]  Well, you should be concerned.
[01:21:56.857 --> 01:21:59.098]  Anything else you want to talk about on this issue, Mike?
[01:22:01.099 --> 01:22:01.799]  In Florida.
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.081]  I believe you actually painted me into a corner as far as I care.
[01:22:06.201 --> 01:22:11.963]  I'm not saying Satanism doesn't exist, and I very well believe that Bush could be involved in Satanism.
[01:22:12.023 --> 01:22:14.024]  No, no, not could be.
[01:22:14.044 --> 01:22:16.925]  They admit they go to the Grove every year.
[01:22:16.945 --> 01:22:18.346]  They're members of Skull and Bones.
[01:22:19.992 --> 01:22:21.133]  Okay, well then they are Satanists.
[01:22:21.313 --> 01:22:22.374]  So I'm saying that J.K.
[01:22:22.454 --> 01:22:25.956]  Rowling is not part of the global elite, nor is she a Satanist.
[01:22:26.076 --> 01:22:27.497]  I believe she's just writing children's books.
[01:22:27.797 --> 01:22:39.845]  Yeah, she writes these books about learning the occult, doing the rituals, and then an obscure scholastic educational publisher...
[01:22:40.465 --> 01:22:44.307]  It's picked up by the big boys and promoted wall to wall in public schools everywhere.
[01:22:45.087 --> 01:22:48.189]  Pay to have the kids get in buses and go see the movies.
[01:22:48.249 --> 01:22:49.809]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:51.630]  It's a gateway into the occult.
[01:22:51.690 --> 01:22:56.232]  Of course the Wiccans say it's all white magic and fun and they're loving.
[01:22:56.772 --> 01:22:58.373]  Oh, come on out to our orgies.
[01:22:58.413 --> 01:22:59.974]  It's a lot of fun, young people.
[01:23:00.454 --> 01:23:03.475]  And then it leads them into the occult and black magic, sir.
[01:23:04.476 --> 01:23:06.537]  I grew up watching it in Dallas, Texas.
[01:23:07.297 --> 01:23:08.438]  We're good to go.
[01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:09.740]  We're good to go.
[01:23:30.039 --> 01:23:33.721]  I mean, I guess we're going to have to agree to disagree on this issue.
[01:23:33.861 --> 01:23:46.468]  I don't see that she's part of the global elite, and I guess you... I told you, sir, that her book is being promoted wall to wall, okay, and that it is shifting the youth over.
[01:23:47.248 --> 01:23:51.050]  Did you know the Fortune 500 are pushing the new age and meditation and all that?
[01:23:51.691 --> 01:23:52.511]  Well, that doesn't surprise me.
[01:23:52.531 --> 01:23:55.873]  Those people are always into that kind of new age.
[01:23:56.313 --> 01:23:57.914]  Well, have you read the books?
[01:23:58.985 --> 01:23:59.965]  I've not read the books.
[01:24:00.045 --> 01:24:01.746]  I've seen the movies.
[01:24:01.846 --> 01:24:02.746]  I'm not a Potter fan.
[01:24:02.826 --> 01:24:03.846]  I've read two of them.
[01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:09.368]  And let me tell you, sir, I have official Black Magic books.
[01:24:09.448 --> 01:24:10.388]  I have read the stuff.
[01:24:10.888 --> 01:24:11.608]  I have studied it.
[01:24:11.688 --> 01:24:13.849]  I've been in some of the most extensive libraries on it.
[01:24:14.189 --> 01:24:16.509]  Tex Mars' library that fills two whole rooms.
[01:24:17.029 --> 01:24:17.890]  Wall-to-wall books.
[01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:20.610]  And let me tell you, it is satanic.
[01:24:22.311 --> 01:24:23.731]  Bottom line, sir.
[01:24:25.091 --> 01:24:25.411]  Okay?
[01:24:25.671 --> 01:24:27.612]  I'm just telling you, you better do some more research.
[01:24:30.587 --> 01:24:31.868]  I don't know really what to say.
[01:24:31.908 --> 01:24:33.529]  I don't know.
[01:24:33.549 --> 01:24:35.069]  Lately, I've just been seeing some things.
[01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:40.552]  I think you've been going off on some tangents on the show.
[01:24:40.832 --> 01:24:46.214]  Yesterday, I heard a lot of homophobic undertones going through the show, too, and it just kind of turns me off as to the work that we're doing.
[01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:49.504]  Well, Mike, let me just tell you something.
[01:24:49.624 --> 01:24:57.030]  When the homosexuals stop working with CPS to take people's kids, I mean, where do you think they're getting all these kids for their so-called families?
[01:24:57.591 --> 01:25:02.995]  When they stop aggressively promoting it in the schools and start leaving their families alone, they'll get left alone.
[01:25:03.916 --> 01:25:08.380]  You don't know how aggressive a lot of the homosexuals are in their movements?
[01:25:10.129 --> 01:25:11.950]  What real difference does it make?
[01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:16.772]  I mean, honestly, what difference does it make if they make any pushes for our movement?
[01:25:16.792 --> 01:25:17.952]  I agree that they should have rights.
[01:25:17.972 --> 01:25:25.195]  I don't see that they should be anything less than... Did you know they go to the front of the line to get kids taken from families through CPS?
[01:25:27.779 --> 01:25:33.043]  I don't see where it would be even a problem if a gay family had a kid.
[01:25:33.103 --> 01:25:35.865]  You're not looking at all the facts.
[01:25:35.925 --> 01:25:37.546]  You're not studying it.
[01:25:37.606 --> 01:25:38.386]  You need to study it.
[01:25:38.406 --> 01:25:38.967]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:39.007 --> 01:25:39.747]  I really appreciate it.
[01:25:39.947 --> 01:25:41.328]  I've had you on for 15 minutes.
[01:25:41.408 --> 01:25:42.329]  It's too long.
[01:25:42.349 --> 01:25:43.069]  I've got to go on.
[01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.770]  Thank you for the call.
[01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:46.091]  Let's talk to Phil in Ohio.
[01:25:46.171 --> 01:25:46.972]  Phil, you're on the air.
[01:25:47.032 --> 01:25:47.432]  Go ahead.
[01:25:49.773 --> 01:25:50.314]  Welcome, Phil.
[01:25:50.354 --> 01:25:53.756]  How are you, Alex?
[01:25:54.156 --> 01:25:54.556]  Pretty good.
[01:25:54.596 --> 01:25:54.957]  Go ahead.
[01:25:55.377 --> 01:25:55.457]  Uh...
[01:25:56.198 --> 01:26:00.084]  I'm not going to put you on the spot here, but you tell us to support your sponsors.
[01:26:00.104 --> 01:26:02.908]  You've got a sponsor supporting your show.
[01:26:02.968 --> 01:26:04.511]  I don't know how it got through Genesis.
[01:26:04.851 --> 01:26:06.454]  R. Clay Financial.
[01:26:06.774 --> 01:26:07.515]  You know about them?
[01:26:08.156 --> 01:26:08.757]  No, I don't.
[01:26:09.058 --> 01:26:09.578]  You know what?
[01:26:13.027 --> 01:26:14.847]  I think I've had enough of this right now.
[01:26:15.368 --> 01:26:17.469]  This show is about fighting the New World Order.
[01:26:17.569 --> 01:26:19.610]  My broadcast is about covering the news.
[01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:23.192]  And I am not going to sit here on my show and talk bad about sponsors.
[01:26:23.352 --> 01:26:26.873]  If you want to send me information, that's fine.
[01:26:26.893 --> 01:26:30.595]  But I do not want to have some discussion when I'm flying blind and don't know what you're talking about.
[01:26:30.615 --> 01:26:32.016]  We'll be back with real news.
[01:26:33.557 --> 01:26:34.477]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.957 --> 01:26:36.578]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.479 --> 01:26:40.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:44.733 --> 01:26:49.278]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:26:49.578 --> 01:26:53.662]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:58.006]  We want to give the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:26:58.026 --> 01:26:58.286]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:21.514]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[01:27:21.715 --> 01:27:23.876]  It is Tuesday, the 1st of July, 2003.
[01:27:23.996 --> 01:27:26.477]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:27:28.218 --> 01:27:36.762]  And, you know, I get into the occult, I get into the globalist and the kidnapping rings and the things they're doing because it's in the mainstream news.
[01:27:38.354 --> 01:27:41.775]  And I know this stuff's hard to believe, but truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:27:41.815 --> 01:27:44.336]  And look at what elites have done throughout history.
[01:27:44.356 --> 01:27:45.216]  They've got it all.
[01:27:45.737 --> 01:27:46.777]  They're very decadent.
[01:27:47.397 --> 01:27:53.079]  And they've always got to do some new, more horrible thing to, as they say, get their jollies.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.680]  That's how the term is used.
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:04.963]  So it may sound bizarre, and it may sound unbelievable, but I'm just here covering what is admitted to
[01:28:06.016 --> 01:28:07.557]  Calmly admitted out in the open.
[01:28:07.577 --> 01:28:12.479]  We're about to go to Pastor Phil and Mark and TJ and the others that are patiently holding.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:17.622]  But right now I wanted to get into some more of this news here briefly, some of this important stuff.
[01:28:18.523 --> 01:28:20.043]  This is out of the London Independent.
[01:28:20.063 --> 01:28:22.205]  There's a lot of news stories out on this today.
[01:28:22.865 --> 01:28:30.389]  Era of unborn mother looms as scientists use aborted fetuses to grow human eggs.
[01:28:31.832 --> 01:28:33.933]  Now, it's not just using the fetuses for parts.
[01:28:33.953 --> 01:28:36.313]  It's not just keeping them alive and growing stuff in them.
[01:28:37.094 --> 01:28:43.155]  And these human beings, they are already doing studies growing human embryos in utero in cows.
[01:28:43.836 --> 01:28:50.578]  They use the cow's larger uterus as a factory to grow the humanoid up larger so they can get larger...
[01:28:52.069 --> 01:28:52.909]  Organs grown.
[01:28:53.170 --> 01:29:09.836]  They want to implant a human baby in a cow, and then because of the way the fetal tissue works, it's able to not reject organ growth and tissue growth, and so they want to create factories of this.
[01:29:10.176 --> 01:29:13.998]  And they'll do it unless you get informed about it and get educated.
[01:29:14.058 --> 01:29:19.160]  I mean, they've already got goats that are part spider that produce body armor out of their udders.
[01:29:20.343 --> 01:29:24.904]  And every time I talk about that, I get emails and calls saying, you're a lunatic, you're crazy, shut up.
[01:29:26.305 --> 01:29:28.545]  You've turned into Art Bell, blah, blah, blah.
[01:29:28.625 --> 01:29:33.106]  Folks, just type spider goats into a search engine, AP, Reuters, Washington Post.
[01:29:33.206 --> 01:29:46.249]  I've had the CEO on last year of one of the big corporations in upstate New York that has thousands of goats at an army base, and they produce body armor for the military and elite SWAT teams.
[01:29:47.670 --> 01:29:48.890]  They produce spider web.
[01:29:49.761 --> 01:29:53.062]  And I had a guy walk up and go, I'm college educated in biology.
[01:29:53.082 --> 01:29:56.022]  There's no transgenic species.
[01:29:56.602 --> 01:29:58.603]  You can't cross an insect with a mammal.
[01:29:58.643 --> 01:30:01.183]  You can't put a mammal gene in a tomato.
[01:30:01.223 --> 01:30:03.384]  When it's been done for decades, it's public.
[01:30:03.424 --> 01:30:05.564]  It's all over mainstream news.
[01:30:05.584 --> 01:30:07.205]  We've had the CEOs on.
[01:30:07.885 --> 01:30:09.785]  And there's still just total denial.
[01:30:10.465 --> 01:30:12.766]  You know, there isn't satanic stuff going on.
[01:30:12.826 --> 01:30:15.606]  There's, you know, Bohemian Grove doesn't exist.
[01:30:15.666 --> 01:30:17.887]  I'm not talking about the last caller or the caller before last.
[01:30:17.927 --> 01:30:19.527]  I'm talking about general public.
[01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:21.990]  And then I'll be on a talk show.
[01:30:22.210 --> 01:30:28.293]  I'll be on these Christian talk shows, and they'll have me debating somebody, and they'll say, Bush is a Christian.
[01:30:29.094 --> 01:30:30.594]  Skull and bones isn't evil.
[01:30:31.115 --> 01:30:32.676]  Bohemian Grove, it doesn't exist.
[01:30:32.696 --> 01:30:33.576]  You're making it up.
[01:30:35.137 --> 01:30:42.701]  While the Bohemian Grove was on national TV on the Trio Network, admitting I snuck in and got the footage, and major newspapers have admitted it.
[01:30:44.073 --> 01:30:46.634]  Again, it's like the globalists saying there is no CFR.
[01:30:46.934 --> 01:30:53.955]  You're a kook if you talk about it, as they're on the news, with CFR under their name, as their credential, calling for a new world order.
[01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:56.936]  So I'm sorry if the truth is bizarre and weird.
[01:30:59.136 --> 01:31:00.837]  But you need to stop living in denial.
[01:31:02.717 --> 01:31:07.138]  There's a lot of people that think that these politically correct liberals out there
[01:31:08.258 --> 01:31:18.504]  They tune into the show because I attack Bush as a globalist and a lying traitor, but they think that I'm going to support all of their ideas and all of their half-baked systems.
[01:31:18.604 --> 01:31:19.505]  And no, I'm not.
[01:31:20.585 --> 01:31:22.686]  I love family and country and God.
[01:31:23.247 --> 01:31:24.688]  I love decency and honor.
[01:31:25.008 --> 01:31:26.229]  And I know what works.
[01:31:26.349 --> 01:31:32.112]  The Bible spells it out with a code of conduct that's good for living and good for your soul.
[01:31:33.132 --> 01:31:33.913]  That's essential.
[01:31:34.753 --> 01:31:41.775]  And just because there's a million New World Order preachers lying and manipulating doesn't mean that my Christian faith is wrong.
[01:31:42.696 --> 01:31:51.179]  And, you know, it's these liberals think that black people can do no wrong, or Hispanics can do no wrong, or other so-called minorities can do no wrong.
[01:31:51.239 --> 01:32:03.963]  And yes, they can, and I will expose them, and I will speak out against their racism and their tribalism, just like I'll speak out against the racism and tribalism of the Ku Klux Klan of the Aryan nations.
[01:32:06.562 --> 01:32:08.002]  We attack corruption.
[01:32:08.042 --> 01:32:09.303]  That's what this show does.
[01:32:09.603 --> 01:32:10.543]  Now, look at this story.
[01:32:10.563 --> 01:32:11.823]  It makes me disgusted.
[01:32:12.703 --> 01:32:16.164]  Folks, if we'll let this happen to the least of us, it'll happen to all of us.
[01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:22.645]  If we let this happen to the meek and the small and the defenseless, that is shameful.
[01:32:22.705 --> 01:32:32.367]  Your instincts should be to violently defend the young, the meek, your children, the defenseless.
[01:32:32.407 --> 01:32:32.627]  I mean...
[01:32:33.772 --> 01:32:40.095]  All the time they see little old ladies getting mugged in Chicago and New York and dozens of cars will drive by and nobody helps them.
[01:32:40.895 --> 01:32:50.859]  A cop got hit by a car two years ago right up the street from my house, laid in the street for over an hour and bled to death and died from brain swelling.
[01:32:51.439 --> 01:32:54.761]  If he would have gotten attention within 30 minutes to an hour, he would have lived.
[01:32:54.841 --> 01:32:58.002]  He died of a massive brain hemorrhage.
[01:32:59.716 --> 01:33:03.717]  People drove by as a cop laid there in the street.
[01:33:04.417 --> 01:33:11.898]  It's like Mike Hanson, who does camera work for me, is running a firework stand to raise money for his campaign for county constable.
[01:33:12.638 --> 01:33:19.019]  He's out there, and he's right on the side of the highway, and people are breaking into his firework stand.
[01:33:19.059 --> 01:33:22.500]  He comes out of the camper trailer with a gun in his underwear, holds them there.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:26.321]  He's out in the street trying to stop cars, telling them to call the police.
[01:33:26.361 --> 01:33:27.261]  They wouldn't stop.
[01:33:27.781 --> 01:33:28.861]  They wouldn't render aid.
[01:33:32.475 --> 01:33:42.281]  You know, I've had a car come before, nobody will stop, nobody will render aid, because we're an emasculated, castrated population who expects the SWAT teams to do it for us.
[01:33:43.642 --> 01:33:44.643]  You've got to render aid.
[01:33:44.683 --> 01:33:51.327]  It's like three weeks ago, two weeks ago, I was out fishing with a friend, and there was a boat stuck.
[01:33:52.083 --> 01:33:53.124]  Out in the middle of the water.
[01:33:53.144 --> 01:33:54.004]  I mean, it's just simple.
[01:33:54.024 --> 01:33:56.225]  We were going to tow them in or try to get their engine started.
[01:33:56.265 --> 01:33:57.746]  I couldn't tie up because of highways.
[01:33:58.106 --> 01:34:01.127]  I jump in, I climb up, I fall off, almost cut my finger off.
[01:34:01.647 --> 01:34:02.688]  I do it again.
[01:34:04.328 --> 01:34:13.092]  But it's just this spectator, mindless mass of people that have never lived, never done anything, live in total fear.
[01:34:14.053 --> 01:34:17.374]  Like that story last year we had guests on up in Toronto.
[01:34:18.835 --> 01:34:21.476]  Major city, downtown, major street.
[01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:24.952]  A woman had been raped, beaten in the head with a lead pipe.
[01:34:25.032 --> 01:34:42.563]  She laid there in the parking lot, ten feet from the sidewalk in the major road, and the head of the company, Fortune 500 Telecommunications Company, laughed at her naked body, bleeding, crawling around on the ground, and told his employees, don't call the police, it'll be a distraction.
[01:34:42.603 --> 01:34:43.423]  They laughed at her.
[01:34:45.524 --> 01:34:48.506]  Let me tell you, I see thugs beating up an old lady.
[01:34:48.586 --> 01:34:51.268]  I'm going to pull a gun, I'm going to go over, and I'm going to kill every one of you.
[01:34:52.543 --> 01:34:54.104]  You come in my house, I'm going to kill you.
[01:34:55.346 --> 01:34:59.890]  You mess with my family or my friends, you violate my rights, I'm coming after you.
[01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:02.492]  If I need to protect my family, I will do it.
[01:35:03.152 --> 01:35:05.935]  I see somebody in the street flopping around, I'm going to help them.
[01:35:08.457 --> 01:35:14.903]  Now, it isn't because I'm a special person or I'm good or I'm wonderful or I'm different.
[01:35:16.164 --> 01:35:19.547]  It's because I've got the instincts that the good Lord gave me
[01:35:20.305 --> 01:35:22.706]  And I am just a basic person.
[01:35:23.547 --> 01:35:26.848]  I'm just a half-decent individual, and I'm a sinner, folks.
[01:35:27.729 --> 01:35:39.434]  But this lack of conviction, these warped values that we've got in this country, this wrongheadedness is killing us.
[01:35:39.494 --> 01:35:41.495]  And your neighbors aren't going to help you when you're in trouble then.
[01:35:42.716 --> 01:35:45.337]  If you don't help people, they're not going to come to your aid.
[01:35:46.578 --> 01:35:46.698]  And...
[01:35:48.186 --> 01:35:49.206]  I don't want to get off into a rant.
[01:35:49.246 --> 01:35:50.107]  I want to go to your calls.
[01:35:50.207 --> 01:35:51.807]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:35:54.708 --> 01:35:56.289]  These babies the government's killing.
[01:35:56.449 --> 01:35:59.090]  This abortion should be banned.
[01:35:59.110 --> 01:36:04.551]  50 million abortions in this country.
[01:36:04.571 --> 01:36:05.532]  54 million.
[01:36:06.812 --> 01:36:08.533]  Hundreds of millions worldwide.
[01:36:09.433 --> 01:36:11.013]  And you wonder why we have tyranny.
[01:36:11.033 --> 01:36:12.494]  You wonder why we have corruption.
[01:36:12.894 --> 01:36:16.015]  You wonder why they're pushing euthanasia, even when you don't want it.
[01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:19.715]  National compulsory service.
[01:36:19.876 --> 01:36:21.119]  Fake patriotism.
[01:36:21.199 --> 01:36:23.305]  Tyranny wrapped in an American flag.
[01:36:24.668 --> 01:36:25.932]  For the cyanide center.
[01:36:28.015 --> 01:36:32.819]  Era of unborn mothers looms as scientists use aborted fetuses to grow human eggs.
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:38.204]  Almost every day a scientific or medical development seems to bring new promise and controversy to mankind.
[01:36:38.304 --> 01:36:41.407]  None more so, perhaps, than in the field of human fertility.
[01:36:41.427 --> 01:36:45.730]  A quarter of a century ago, the first tested baby, Louise Brown, was born.
[01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:49.554]  Now scientists have raised another startling prospect, unborn mothers.
[01:36:50.254 --> 01:36:52.016]  How blasphemous does it get?
[01:36:53.743 --> 01:37:09.713]  The notion that children can derive from human matter that has not itself been born sounds the stuff of science fiction, yet it has moved a step closer with research showing that it is possible to extract ovarian tissue from aborted fetuses for in vitro fertilization IVF treatment.
[01:37:10.213 --> 01:37:17.057]  Scientists announced yesterday that they have been able to remove immature ovaries from four-month-old fetuses.
[01:37:17.117 --> 01:37:22.681]  The theory is that they can then be simulated in a test tube to grow through the larger stages of
[01:37:23.311 --> 01:37:23.891]  We're good to go.
[01:37:23.911 --> 01:37:24.071]  I think?
[01:37:41.949 --> 01:37:54.857]  When a high-powered committee of British ethicists considered this possible in the early 90s, it took a view that a child created by such a procedure would not be able to come to terms with the idea of arriving from aborted fetal tissue.
[01:37:56.057 --> 01:37:57.718]  And it goes on that they're already doing it.
[01:37:57.959 --> 01:38:00.460]  I just don't know what to say anymore.
[01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:10.246]  Tens of thousands in a Hong Kong protest, tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents are protesting over anti-subdivision subversion law.
[01:38:11.047 --> 01:38:13.989]  They fear one of my local freedoms of speech press and assembly.
[01:38:14.029 --> 01:38:21.474]  They've already kicked off a bunch of radio talk show hosts, including one individual who's had the number one talk show in Hong Kong.
[01:38:22.635 --> 01:38:29.520]  And it said that he had not been properly respectful to government officials in interviews with them.
[01:38:30.681 --> 01:38:31.341]  Now he's removed.
[01:38:31.362 --> 01:38:31.962]  That's the freedom.
[01:38:33.343 --> 01:38:36.105]  Victoria delays gun buyback move.
[01:38:36.405 --> 01:38:38.867]  Gun owners will not be able to hand...
[01:38:39.699 --> 01:38:50.945]  Donors will not be able to hand in banned firearms in Victoria today after Brock's government last night said it would delay collecting handguns as part of the national buyback scheme until August 1st.
[01:38:51.005 --> 01:38:52.086]  They've already banned most guns.
[01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:54.507]  Now they're banning the last remaining guns.
[01:38:54.567 --> 01:38:58.670]  Instead, the guns, which have become illegal from midnight, must be kept locked for at least a month.
[01:39:00.471 --> 01:39:03.733]  We got that, the total gun confiscation, the crime rate exploding.
[01:39:04.473 --> 01:39:05.053]  Here's another one.
[01:39:05.093 --> 01:39:07.755]  CBC of Canada gun registry deadline looms.
[01:39:08.906 --> 01:39:14.171]  All but two provinces have refused to enforce the federal gun confiscation and registration program.
[01:39:15.372 --> 01:39:19.116]  They're now refusing because guns that were registered two years ago are now being banned.
[01:39:19.236 --> 01:39:20.397]  This is out of the CBC.
[01:39:20.437 --> 01:39:25.702]  Canada's gun owners must have until midnight Monday registered their guns or possibly face charges.
[01:39:25.982 --> 01:39:28.224]  Again, registration, confiscation, extermination.
[01:39:29.465 --> 01:39:33.469]  Implementing the Firearms Act, the rising cost, but Wayne Esker...
[01:39:35.103 --> 01:39:40.504]  Easter, excuse me, Canada's Solicitor General is encouraging gun owners to keep registering even after the deadline has passed.
[01:39:40.544 --> 01:39:42.885]  We're not intending to go on a watch hunt.
[01:39:43.845 --> 01:39:51.647]  He said a witch hunt, but if circumstances are such that police officers come across in a weapon or a gun that is not registered, then those people are eligible to be charged.
[01:39:52.647 --> 01:39:54.407]  And they're banning the guns they register.
[01:39:54.427 --> 01:39:57.148]  They already had the first wave of registration two years ago.
[01:39:59.788 --> 01:40:00.729]  And here's another.
[01:40:00.809 --> 01:40:02.229]  I'm going to go to your calls in a second, folks.
[01:40:02.249 --> 01:40:02.929]  Just be patient.
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:04.160]  Poll.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.601]  Americans less positive on Iraq.
[01:40:07.421 --> 01:40:11.921]  As a new poll shows, less Americans believe things are going well in Iraq.
[01:40:11.941 --> 01:40:16.582]  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Monday that the fighting there would continue for some time.
[01:40:18.043 --> 01:40:20.043]  And now 56% of Americans think current U.S.
[01:40:20.063 --> 01:40:23.844]  coalition efforts are going well, according to a new CNN-USA Gallup poll.
[01:40:24.864 --> 01:40:27.864]  That is much lower than the 70% in late May.
[01:40:27.904 --> 01:40:31.805]  That's 86% in early May who thought things were going well.
[01:40:34.051 --> 01:40:35.612]  Well, I mean, they're going well for the globalists.
[01:40:35.632 --> 01:40:36.953]  They could care less if a few U.S.
[01:40:36.973 --> 01:40:39.534]  troops get killed or thousands huff D.U.
[01:40:39.574 --> 01:40:41.295]  and are now becoming ill, admitted fact.
[01:40:41.855 --> 01:40:46.498]  All they care about is the oil and Iraq as a launch base into Syria and Iran.
[01:40:46.518 --> 01:40:57.124]  And that is now their official battle plan, by the way, in this massive escalation of the total and complete police state.
[01:40:58.562 --> 01:41:00.663]  So, again, they tried to make it a liberal issue.
[01:41:00.723 --> 01:41:03.183]  Oh, you're against the war, you're a liberal, and that is totally untrue.
[01:41:03.223 --> 01:41:05.184]  Look at Ron Paul and many others that are against it.
[01:41:05.664 --> 01:41:07.124]  Most conservative members of Congress.
[01:41:08.185 --> 01:41:10.345]  U.S.-based missiles to have global reach.
[01:41:10.405 --> 01:41:15.287]  Allies to become less important as a new generation of weapons that enables America to strike anywhere from its own territory.
[01:41:18.127 --> 01:41:23.449]  Interesting article about how the science fiction UFO movement is funded by the globalists.
[01:41:24.477 --> 01:41:30.640]  To then be connected to the Patriot Movement so people don't take serious any real information, which I guess what a caller was getting to earlier.
[01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:36.942]  Sci-Fi Channel put its money behind UFO investigations and an unusual step for a television network.
[01:41:37.042 --> 01:41:43.525]  Sci-Fi Channel is campaigning to pressure the government for more forthcoming and aggressive in investigating UFO sightings.
[01:41:44.389 --> 01:41:44.930]  We're good to go.
[01:42:10.859 --> 01:42:15.580]  And it goes on, most TV networks are reluctant to spend money for anything other than self-interest.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:16.620]  Oh, but they care.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:18.261]  They're just getting free material.
[01:42:18.801 --> 01:42:26.663]  But by fighting for UFO probes, sci-fi is wading into an area that invites not only dissent but also ridicule.
[01:42:27.863 --> 01:42:36.025]  It is very, very tough for people to take this subject seriously, said Ed Rothschild, a lobbyist for the Washington firm Podesta Mantoon.
[01:42:36.934 --> 01:42:41.835]  We thought the only way it was going to be seriously addressed is to have serious people talk about it.
[01:42:42.375 --> 01:42:48.577]  Rothschild won't even identify the members of Congress who talked to about learning of the government far more openness about UFOs.
[01:42:48.617 --> 01:42:49.617]  He's afraid they'll never help.
[01:42:50.037 --> 01:42:52.118]  Their names come out, they're laughed at.
[01:42:53.698 --> 01:42:54.639]  It goes on and on.
[01:42:55.379 --> 01:42:58.380]  Who's the caller who's a cell phone caller in Minnesota, Mark?
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.241]  Yeah, okay, well, we'll go to them after the...
[01:43:05.490 --> 01:43:08.911]  Pastor Phil in Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:43:08.951 --> 01:43:09.411]  Go ahead.
[01:43:09.992 --> 01:43:11.912]  Yes, Yahweh be with you, Alex.
[01:43:12.492 --> 01:43:15.473]  Just keep up that good work that you're doing.
[01:43:15.853 --> 01:43:19.534]  You're going to reap abundant harvest in due season.
[01:43:20.855 --> 01:43:28.577]  Now, these people who think that Harry Potter is no problem, these books contain the most vivid discussions
[01:43:28.925 --> 01:43:29.365]  I think so.
[01:43:52.745 --> 01:43:53.845]  Do what it said to do.
[01:43:54.066 --> 01:44:13.694]  He told us, Do not let anyone be found among us who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or one who practices divination, or a user of magic, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, or one who conjures spells, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead.
[01:44:14.799 --> 01:44:18.262]  And it's just amazing to see how this scourge is unleashed.
[01:44:18.302 --> 01:44:22.926]  By the way, all of that was done at the ritual that I saw at Bohemian Grove three years ago.
[01:44:23.126 --> 01:44:24.067]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:44:24.147 --> 01:44:25.848]  I got your tape there.
[01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:33.234]  And still haven't had any breakthrough on getting you live on the air in this area, but I'm still working on it.
[01:44:33.694 --> 01:44:34.075]  Good!
[01:44:34.615 --> 01:44:35.576]  Yeah.
[01:44:35.756 --> 01:44:36.476]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:44:36.496 --> 01:44:43.122]  I'll let you finish up on the other side, then I'll go to all the other followers that are holding, and we'll go into the third hour with more calls and more news.
[01:44:44.852 --> 01:44:46.533]  Stay with us.
[01:44:46.653 --> 01:44:47.273]  We'll be right back.
[01:44:47.313 --> 01:44:48.033]  Please stay with us.
[01:45:04.395 --> 01:45:07.856]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:45:08.136 --> 01:45:11.637]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:45:11.717 --> 01:45:15.658]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:45:15.879 --> 01:45:22.040]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:45:22.461 --> 01:45:30.363]  The trihalomethanes, volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:45:30.783 --> 01:45:36.124]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:45:36.284 --> 01:45:40.045]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:45:40.405 --> 01:45:42.266]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:45:42.326 --> 01:45:44.487]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:45:44.747 --> 01:45:49.668]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:46:03.434 --> 01:46:08.339]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a road map and how easy it would be to get lost?
[01:46:08.639 --> 01:46:10.000]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:12.362]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[01:46:12.802 --> 01:46:15.645]  Fortunately, there is a road map to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[01:46:15.685 --> 01:46:16.045]  coins.
[01:46:16.285 --> 01:46:17.546]  The Red Book Guide to U.S.
[01:46:17.586 --> 01:46:23.131]  Coins and History provides you with the knowledge you'll need to make informed decisions when it comes to collecting and investing in U.S.
[01:46:23.171 --> 01:46:24.112]  gold and silver coins.

[01:46:58.563 --> 01:47:06.628]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:06.808 --> 01:47:11.230]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:15.753]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:47:15.793 --> 01:47:17.134]  The New World Order.
[01:47:18.937 --> 01:47:23.160]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:30.144]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:47:30.265 --> 01:47:32.366]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:32.666 --> 01:47:42.773]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:47:42.773 --> 01:47:43.433]  We're good to go.
[01:48:12.165 --> 01:48:16.846]  We are accelerating towards the third hour.
[01:48:16.866 --> 01:48:26.428]  I know we've got Pastor Phil, Mark Wyatt, Bob, Joe, JQ, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:48:28.309 --> 01:48:31.550]  And we do have a guest as well coming up later in the next hour.
[01:48:31.570 --> 01:48:32.470]  So everybody stay with us.
[01:48:32.490 --> 01:48:36.731]  And I have gotten to a lot of the news, but there's still a ton of even more vital stuff coming up.
[01:48:36.791 --> 01:48:40.832]  So if your station doesn't carry the third hour, I would respectfully ask them to try to do that
[01:48:41.918 --> 01:48:46.201]  Because we cover so much information in the third hour, and we are thankful to all our affiliates.
[01:48:46.682 --> 01:48:49.003]  I want to go back to Pastor Phil, though.
[01:48:49.664 --> 01:48:52.846]  Look, they put this nice face on the whole Wiccan thing.
[01:48:52.906 --> 01:48:54.027]  Oh, we don't sacrifice.
[01:48:54.087 --> 01:48:55.088]  Oh, that's a wives' tale.
[01:48:55.108 --> 01:48:56.029]  That's a stereotype.
[01:48:56.389 --> 01:49:03.815]  No, that's exactly what the Druids, the Aztecs, the Romans, the Babylonians, that's what all these other occultic religions do.
[01:49:04.275 --> 01:49:05.516]  It's historical fact.
[01:49:06.056 --> 01:49:09.178]  Now, dead animals, dead kids, the numbers are exploding.
[01:49:09.198 --> 01:49:16.663]  I got news articles on it from the Denver Post today, and people try to ignore all this, and it needs to stop.
[01:49:16.843 --> 01:49:24.709]  And that's what the Harry Potter books do, is they're all about this magical system getting power out of getting involved in this.
[01:49:26.730 --> 01:49:27.551]  It's a horrible thing.
[01:49:27.571 --> 01:49:28.891]  Do you have any other comments you wanted to make?
[01:49:29.812 --> 01:49:33.635]  I really didn't talk about that, but they've got...
[01:49:34.574 --> 01:49:37.955]  Five miles from here, they've got Hamdi in the brig.
[01:49:38.595 --> 01:49:44.176]  Can I issue a writ of habeas corpus and demand his due process?
[01:49:45.136 --> 01:49:46.196]  They've got who in the brig?
[01:49:46.677 --> 01:49:50.957]  Hamdi, the enemy combatant they're holding, the U.S.
[01:49:50.997 --> 01:49:51.398]  citizen.
[01:49:52.218 --> 01:49:53.678]  They're holding him in the Norfolk brig.
[01:49:54.618 --> 01:49:56.319]  Yeah, I know that they're holding him.
[01:49:56.619 --> 01:50:02.160]  They've got floating brigs out there, and these are citizens that aren't going to be given due process.
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:02.960]  Hey, if they're guilty...
[01:50:04.526 --> 01:50:08.029]  Throw away the key, throw the switch, whatever, but no, we need to see the evidence.
[01:50:08.729 --> 01:50:09.250]  Absolutely.
[01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:15.595]  Because the Justice Department has said, Washington Times, now official, they will use it for all crimes against all citizens.
[01:50:15.935 --> 01:50:17.036]  It's not just for terror.
[01:50:17.777 --> 01:50:23.101]  And they're contemplating on bringing the John Lee Malvo trial to my area also.
[01:50:23.302 --> 01:50:24.763]  And I'm gathering information on
[01:50:26.004 --> 01:50:28.485]  MKUltra and things of that nature, the Northwoods Doctrine.
[01:50:29.105 --> 01:50:30.706]  Oh, the Northwoods Doctrine where the U.S.
[01:50:30.746 --> 01:50:32.966]  government calls for sniper attacks in D.C.
[01:50:33.086 --> 01:50:34.847]  and even how to frame patsies.
[01:50:35.527 --> 01:50:36.027]  That's right.
[01:50:36.927 --> 01:50:41.809]  By the way, a caller called yesterday and said he was in the 911 section archive and couldn't download that.
[01:50:42.469 --> 01:50:44.650]  The file opened for us in about two seconds.
[01:50:46.830 --> 01:50:51.692]  The feds are also going after, did you see where they're going after Steve Dover?
[01:50:53.809 --> 01:50:55.917]  Look, they're banning vitamin C in Europe.
[01:50:56.659 --> 01:50:58.707]  They're going after liquid vitamins now.
[01:50:59.717 --> 01:51:01.698]  And we've talked about sea silver here on the air.
[01:51:02.179 --> 01:51:03.259]  They run advertisers.
[01:51:03.279 --> 01:51:06.341]  It just says it's a super vitamin and that you don't lose it.
[01:51:06.361 --> 01:51:08.543]  Well, everybody knows that the liquid vitamins are the best.
[01:51:08.623 --> 01:51:11.585]  I was using stuff before sea silver that was liquid.
[01:51:11.985 --> 01:51:13.106]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:51:13.246 --> 01:51:18.709]  Everything's evil now, but they can splice and dice the genes and mix animals and plants.
[01:51:18.769 --> 01:51:19.370]  Thanks for the call.
[01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.870]  Okay, you're welcome.
[01:51:20.250 --> 01:51:20.811]  Appreciate it.
[01:51:20.831 --> 01:51:24.433]  We're going to break and come back and go to Mark and Wyatt and Bob and Joe and others.
[01:51:25.839 --> 01:51:34.387]  Before I end this hour, it's important you support the show, what we do here, and that's through the videos, through my book, through the purchase of those, plus they're great films.
[01:51:34.927 --> 01:51:44.476]  You're authorized and encouraged to make copies, who else says that, for non-profit, not for self-purposes, to spread the word, to force multiply the information geometrically.
[01:51:45.425 --> 01:51:47.086]  Roads of Tyranny covers September 11th.
[01:51:47.567 --> 01:51:48.768]  And who really carried that out?
[01:51:48.928 --> 01:51:50.349]  So important to tell that story.
[01:51:50.389 --> 01:51:51.530]  It's up to you to spread the word.
[01:51:51.850 --> 01:51:52.891]  Best tool we found.
[01:51:53.031 --> 01:51:55.153]  Waking up 90% of those that see it.
[01:51:55.473 --> 01:51:57.094]  Masters of Terror is part two of that.
[01:51:57.174 --> 01:51:58.936]  Police State 3 is my newest film.
[01:51:59.476 --> 01:52:00.777]  Covers Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[01:52:00.837 --> 01:52:01.758]  Homeland Security.
[01:52:01.878 --> 01:52:03.799]  Dozens of examples of government-sponsored terror.
[01:52:03.819 --> 01:52:06.141]  We've got the other Police State films.
[01:52:06.181 --> 01:52:07.923]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:52:08.303 --> 01:52:09.504]  Want to find out about the occult?

[01:52:44.289 --> 01:52:45.630]  Get involved in the Infowar.

[01:52:45.730 --> 01:52:47.332]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:52:47.412 --> 01:52:48.473]  Please stay with us.
[01:52:54.531 --> 01:52:55.472]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[01:52:55.492 --> 01:53:02.740]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year, and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:12.491]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:20.740]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.401 --> 01:53:22.461]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:23.182 --> 01:53:24.262]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.943 --> 01:53:25.743]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.503 --> 01:53:27.404]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.424 --> 01:53:31.746]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.246 --> 01:53:36.368]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:39.170 --> 01:53:41.671]  All right, folks, I'm really glad you joined us.
[01:53:41.691 --> 01:53:43.232]  We're going to have a power pack.
[01:53:44.033 --> 01:53:46.494]  Third hour on this 1st of July, 2003.
[01:53:46.835 --> 01:53:54.339]  On this Tuesday edition, I know that we've got Mark White, Bob Joe, Howard, and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:58.601]  And coming up, I want to go back into some of the headlines.
[01:53:59.061 --> 01:54:08.607]  Flu could be next terror weapon, warns scientists, after the federal government dug it back up and is now going to release the genetic sequences of the swine flu, the Spanish flu.
[01:54:09.707 --> 01:54:12.729]  Also, Senate bill would alter line of presidential succession.
[01:54:13.838 --> 01:54:14.738]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:54:14.818 --> 01:54:16.339]  I'm not the one with the cell phone.
[01:54:43.132 --> 01:54:44.813]  All right, well, there were a couple of calls from Minnesota.
[01:54:44.833 --> 01:54:45.153]  Go ahead.
[01:54:45.253 --> 01:54:47.895]  But I have an idea.
[01:54:49.055 --> 01:54:59.922]  Perhaps this might sound silly to some people, but actually I'm kind of afraid to even mention it, lest I be accused of being a terrorist or something like that, some sort of terroristic plot.
[01:55:00.022 --> 01:55:10.588]  But I was thinking, well, once you understand, and I know you understand this, but for the listeners, once you understand the nexus between the government's power to inflate
[01:55:11.246 --> 01:55:24.390]  And, you know, how it injects funds into the loan market and so forth, and really the power that it has, its power to inflate is where it derives pretty much all of its power.
[01:55:24.410 --> 01:55:36.114]  I understand how really one of our final checks that we have on the statism is actually the power to withdraw your money from banks.
[01:55:37.143 --> 01:55:39.323]  And I just had an idea.
[01:55:39.343 --> 01:55:44.785]  I was thinking we should promote the idea of people withdrawing their money from banks.
[01:55:44.805 --> 01:55:51.106]  Have like a national withdraw your money from your bank week or something like that.
[01:55:54.606 --> 01:55:55.947]  Well, it's been thought of.
[01:55:56.587 --> 01:56:02.348]  Unfortunately, the globalists control the financial paradigm to such an extent they would just issue more money.
[01:56:03.237 --> 01:56:09.023]  They want to move to a cashless society ID card system where you'll still have cash notes.
[01:56:09.043 --> 01:56:11.045]  This is publicly stated, by the way, by the Federal Reserve.
[01:56:11.526 --> 01:56:14.969]  You'll still have cash in your pocket, but it's electronically identified.
[01:56:14.989 --> 01:56:17.572]  If you don't keep it in the bank, it's devalued.
[01:56:18.903 --> 01:56:21.644]  Now, we're pretty much... I mean, the fact that dollars are printed is a mere technicality.
[01:56:46.539 --> 01:57:06.253]  This is why I don't think it would be inflationary if everybody decided to withdraw their funds and then the government ended up just printing dollars to back up deposits because it doesn't matter what form money is in, whether it's cash or a deposit.
[01:57:06.633 --> 01:57:13.918]  All deposit money already counts as money, and the monetary rates have already shifted by the time that they print dollars.
[01:57:14.298 --> 01:57:17.901]  Where it would become hyperinflationary is the moment you redeposit the money.
[01:57:18.221 --> 01:57:18.761]  But you're right.
[01:57:18.862 --> 01:57:29.189]  As soon as they go cashless, Alex, we will have lost that check on the system because it will be impossible to do business without having to use the system.
[01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:40.378]  And also, I'm sure there are some people that might think that I'm living in a stone age and this is a Neanderthal idea, but I would just have to say, hey, if the system is really solvent,
[01:57:40.996 --> 01:57:45.321]  What would be the harm in people going to get their money out of their bank?
[01:57:45.521 --> 01:57:51.848]  Well, these are massive tools of control, and they're increasing the controls, and they're getting rid of any checks and balances we have.
[01:57:51.868 --> 01:57:53.530]  They're going to the casual society.
[01:57:53.991 --> 01:57:55.012]  They're getting rid of juries.
[01:57:55.052 --> 01:57:56.333]  They're getting rid of grand juries.
[01:57:56.373 --> 01:57:58.536]  They're getting rid of all the basic tenets.
[01:57:59.176 --> 01:58:01.058]  To give the people power in 1913.
[01:58:01.118 --> 01:58:04.522]  They took our senators from the state, made them federal creatures.
[01:58:05.102 --> 01:58:10.508]  The 1947 National Security Act, the 1933 War Powers Act, 2002 Homeland Security.
[01:58:10.588 --> 01:58:12.129]  It's all about centralizing power.
[01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:13.711]  It's a march to slavery.
[01:58:17.136 --> 01:58:23.085]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:58:23.305 --> 01:58:25.568]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[01:59:19.113 --> 01:59:20.395]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:59:20.595 --> 01:59:26.361]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.

[01:59:36.493 --> 01:59:40.254]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:59:40.534 --> 01:59:45.176]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:59:45.256 --> 01:59:51.517]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:59:51.557 --> 01:59:53.378]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:00:16.371 --> 02:00:22.117]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:00:22.377 --> 02:00:27.522]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.

[02:00:42.757 --> 02:00:46.761]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.

[02:01:26.523 --> 02:01:32.389]  Alright, coming up in just a few minutes, we're going to go to Wyatt, Bob, Joe, Howard, and many others that are holding.
[02:01:32.409 --> 02:01:33.631]  And I want to go to your calls quickly.
[02:01:33.651 --> 02:01:37.535]  I want to take a bunch of calls in the next 52 minutes.
[02:01:38.476 --> 02:01:45.423]  Then I've got more on the era of unborn mother looms as scientists use aborted fetuses to grow human eggs.
[02:01:46.585 --> 02:01:48.326]  And I want to get into the CIA.
[02:01:48.366 --> 02:01:50.908]  North Korea may be trying to miniaturize nuclear weapons.
[02:01:51.028 --> 02:01:59.394]  Oh, Clinton and Rumsfeld helped give the technology to the Communist Chinese, helped give them the reactors to produce this stuff in North Korea.
[02:01:59.414 --> 02:02:00.375]  So what do you expect?
[02:02:01.227 --> 02:02:10.671]  Also, the CIA going domestic and controlling police departments, blue spies for the city, New York Post, Fed spreads security money all around the homeland.
[02:02:10.691 --> 02:02:19.275]  Another article, Pentagon reveals secret biochem test on thousands of its own troops, killing and maiming its own troops.
[02:02:19.455 --> 02:02:21.476]  Oh, but they wouldn't carry out September 11th.
[02:02:22.984 --> 02:02:26.387]  Also, Iraqi details harsh treatment as amnesty criticizes U.S.
[02:02:26.427 --> 02:02:27.447]  interrogation methods.
[02:02:27.748 --> 02:02:28.688]  This is torture.
[02:02:29.049 --> 02:02:37.415]  Wait till you hear about this out of the Associated Press and how it ties together with Israel saying that they do have secret jails where they torture people.
[02:02:38.275 --> 02:02:39.996]  It's all coming up.
[02:02:41.137 --> 02:02:45.220]  But first, we're going to take these calls, okay, before we get to all that news.
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:46.661]  So I want everybody to be patient.
[02:02:46.681 --> 02:02:47.502]  We're going to get to you.
[02:02:48.413 --> 02:02:55.860]  But right now, for the next five minutes, I drug Jim Shepard back on the air because this is about taking control of your life, folks.
[02:02:56.461 --> 02:03:09.754]  The last few weeks, I have read dozens of additional major medical reports, University of Texas, New York University, Beijing, Australia, I mean everywhere.
[02:03:10.313 --> 02:03:16.138]  There are thousands of them, but I've read modern reports out of Ireland where they did 30-year studies.
[02:03:16.818 --> 02:03:23.984]  Bone fractures, brain damage, retardation of growth, toxifying the system.
[02:03:24.104 --> 02:03:27.207]  Sodium fluoride is deadly poison.
[02:03:27.267 --> 02:03:30.870]  It's not the calcium fluoride that is good for you in low levels.
[02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:31.770]  It's totally different.
[02:03:32.731 --> 02:03:33.812]  And they put it in the water.
[02:03:34.593 --> 02:03:36.034]  It's mainstream news in Europe.
[02:03:36.054 --> 02:03:36.654]  This is deadly.
[02:03:36.694 --> 02:03:37.815]  It's getting banned everywhere.
[02:03:37.855 --> 02:03:39.857]  The government's fighting back, getting really angry.
[02:03:40.515 --> 02:03:43.196]  You look in polls in Europe, 90 plus percent are against it.
[02:03:44.817 --> 02:03:46.178]  Folks, this is a major issue.
[02:03:46.498 --> 02:03:57.603]  And if you can't drink filtered water to stop drinking the herbicides, the pesticides, the chlorine, they have a special filter for fluoride because it's so hard to cut out.
[02:03:57.643 --> 02:03:58.524]  It's so powerful.
[02:03:58.824 --> 02:03:59.884]  It's so microscopic.
[02:03:59.944 --> 02:04:01.345]  It cuts through anything and everything.
[02:04:01.385 --> 02:04:02.565]  Never biodegrades.
[02:04:02.866 --> 02:04:03.626]  It's deadly stuff.
[02:04:04.272 --> 02:04:07.494]  The toxic waste they had, so they started just dumping it in the water, saying it's good for you.
[02:04:07.514 --> 02:04:09.756]  It's like DU, the waste of reactors.
[02:04:09.816 --> 02:04:12.958]  Oh, we'll just shoot it into cities, and so what if the troops die?
[02:04:12.998 --> 02:04:14.139]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:15.901]  It cuts out the bacteria.
[02:04:15.941 --> 02:04:19.243]  That stuff's easy with these systems.
[02:04:19.824 --> 02:04:28.910]  If you don't get a high-quality water filter system, if you don't get portable sports bottles, if you don't stop something that's contaminating 70% of your body,
[02:04:30.515 --> 02:04:32.497]  Then you can never take control of your life.
[02:04:32.537 --> 02:04:33.938]  This is a basic thing.
[02:04:34.358 --> 02:04:35.419]  It's a great product.
[02:04:35.539 --> 02:04:38.001]  I bought these products from middlemen.
[02:04:38.301 --> 02:04:39.442]  They came from Jim Shepard.
[02:04:39.482 --> 02:04:40.703]  I've now bought some from him.
[02:04:40.723 --> 02:04:42.125]  He's our sponsor.
[02:04:42.165 --> 02:04:46.028]  He's got a great product, and you need to take control of your lives now.
[02:04:46.108 --> 02:04:47.549]  Jim Shepard, good to have you on the show.
[02:04:47.689 --> 02:04:48.750]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:49.711]  How are you this afternoon?
[02:04:50.431 --> 02:05:00.398]  I am fired up and it's great to have you on and I am just hoping people support the show and get a fine product and take control of their lives.
[02:05:01.058 --> 02:05:17.449]  Alex, it's always a pleasure to be on your show and you know you were talking about the fluoride issue and it's interesting, a lot of these European countries, as you and the listeners may well know, they've gone to a completely socialized medical system where people
[02:05:17.876 --> 02:05:24.122]  Everybody is taxed high bucks, but they don't have to worry about medical because the government takes care of it.
[02:05:24.783 --> 02:05:32.231]  And in most of those countries where the government gets the bill for the medical treatment, they will not allow fluoride to be put in the water.
[02:05:32.871 --> 02:05:33.832]  And that ought to be telling.
[02:05:35.093 --> 02:05:37.896]  Well, I mean, there's so many documents, so many tests.
[02:05:37.976 --> 02:05:38.577]  It's deadly.
[02:05:40.018 --> 02:05:42.579]  Bone fractures, brain damage, the list goes on and on.
[02:05:42.619 --> 02:05:44.180]  That's just one thing that's in our water.
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:49.603]  The feds said put MBTE in, now it contaminated 49 states, a deadly carcinogen.
[02:05:50.143 --> 02:05:51.524]  Jim, you've got a lot of great products.
[02:05:51.564 --> 02:05:52.164]  Tell us about them.
[02:05:52.184 --> 02:05:53.985]  Tell us about the deals you're offering today.
[02:05:54.285 --> 02:05:54.605]  Okay.
[02:05:54.665 --> 02:06:03.969]  Well, we've just recently introduced the PF2 filters, which are designed to reduce the fluoride that's in the water.
[02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:04.750]  Okay.
[02:06:05.598 --> 02:06:10.540]  Alex, we have gotten probably more calls on fluoride than we have just about any other chemical.
[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:23.285]  Now, the black Berkey filter elements themselves will remove to non-detectable levels chemicals like MTBE, which you just mentioned, without requiring any kind of post filtration device.
[02:06:23.805 --> 02:06:27.687]  They'll also remove pathogenic bacteria to non-detectable levels, which means
[02:06:28.174 --> 02:06:37.659]  That after the water goes through there, they cannot detect any bacteria in the water, even after being incubated and viewed under electron microscope.
[02:06:37.679 --> 02:06:38.639]  They can't find any.
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:41.921]  So the black Berkey filter elements are very powerful.
[02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:48.164]  There's a lot of folks that have gotten the new systems with the black Berkey filter elements, but they're still concerned about fluoride.
[02:06:48.184 --> 02:06:56.709]  So we are introducing the PF2 fluoride reduction post filters, and they simply fit on the system.
[02:06:57.686 --> 02:07:01.749]  And these are $49 for a set of two.
[02:07:02.569 --> 02:07:10.254]  And what we're going to offer to your listeners is for two sets, the second set is 50% off.
[02:07:10.334 --> 02:07:11.835]  So I believe that comes out to be about $73.50.
[02:07:12.235 --> 02:07:15.297]  You get two sets.
[02:07:15.337 --> 02:07:20.280]  That's enough to remove and reduce the fluoride for about a year.
[02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:24.002]  The filter elements need to be replaced about every six months.
[02:07:25.956 --> 02:07:32.561]  And also, for folks who do not have a Berkey Light system, we're going to offer a special.
[02:07:33.662 --> 02:07:37.285]  Well, Jim, let me just throw something out here real briefly, and then we'll let you finish up and we'll go to the calls.
[02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:39.490]  I've got to say this.
[02:07:39.850 --> 02:07:45.274]  Folks, when you go buy a filter at the grocery store or at Home Depot, none of these things cut out fluoride.
[02:07:45.314 --> 02:07:47.135]  It takes a special filter.
[02:07:47.175 --> 02:07:48.416]  This stuff is so deadly.
[02:07:48.456 --> 02:07:48.816]  Go ahead.
[02:07:49.076 --> 02:07:54.120]  So that's why your other filters would last for years and years and years and do 20 times what these will.
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:58.383]  The special filter that goes at the end of the process only works for a year.
[02:07:59.423 --> 02:08:02.945]  Because the fluoride is so incredibly powerful.
[02:08:02.985 --> 02:08:03.345]  Go ahead.
[02:08:03.525 --> 02:08:10.529]  It's very difficult to extract fluoride out of the water, and unfortunately you need a whole lot of material to get a little tiny bit of fluoride out.
[02:08:10.669 --> 02:08:26.837]  And so that's our limiting factor that we're having to deal with, and that's why we need to replace these every six months, because we pack them to the brim with the media, and then they're useful for about six months, and then it plays out, and you've got to refresh the media that removes that fluoride
[02:08:27.869 --> 02:08:30.150]  From the water, removes or reduces.
[02:08:32.252 --> 02:08:48.540]  Okay, the second special that we're going to run is if you purchase a Berkey light and a set of the PF2 fluoride reduction filters, then we will throw an additional set in absolutely free, no charge at all.
[02:08:49.266 --> 02:08:52.389]  For those that don't know, the Berkey Light has the LEDs that run all night.
[02:08:52.449 --> 02:08:53.069]  It's see-through.
[02:08:53.129 --> 02:08:53.970]  It's a great system.
[02:08:54.010 --> 02:08:54.991]  It's got a great base.
[02:08:55.491 --> 02:08:58.173]  What's the toll-free number for folks to call, Jim?
[02:08:58.233 --> 02:08:59.174]  They can reach us at 888-803-4438.
[02:08:59.234 --> 02:08:59.414]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:09:07.534 --> 02:09:12.838]  4438.
[02:09:08.695 --> 02:09:12.838]  And folks, you'll notice the prices you're hearing are substantially lower than what you hear in the ads.
[02:09:12.918 --> 02:09:14.459]  So tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:09:14.739 --> 02:09:15.900]  And take control of your life.
[02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:17.581]  I mean, it feels good to promote this product.
[02:09:17.761 --> 02:09:18.722]  I use it in my home.
[02:09:19.342 --> 02:09:20.583]  I use it when I go on trips.
[02:09:20.623 --> 02:09:22.284]  We take the little sports bottles with us.
[02:09:23.265 --> 02:09:24.165]  It is so important.
[02:09:24.185 --> 02:09:29.129]  And after you've been on filtered water, bottled water, it tastes like trash.
[02:09:29.709 --> 02:09:35.713]  The only thing I can drink now, unless I'm in a restaurant and it's really cold and I can still taste all the dirt, we've got good water here in Austin.
[02:09:36.543 --> 02:09:37.504]  Is Berkey Water.
[02:09:37.584 --> 02:09:43.409]  You need to take advantage of it now.
[02:09:43.429 --> 02:09:44.450]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:09:44.591 --> 02:09:47.413]  They got potassium iodate in case there's a nuclear attack.
[02:09:47.773 --> 02:09:48.694]  Protects the thyroid.
[02:09:48.714 --> 02:09:50.976]  They got the portable sports bottles at great deals.
[02:09:51.297 --> 02:09:52.478]  They got all these other specials.
[02:09:52.518 --> 02:09:53.138]  Give them a call.
[02:09:53.399 --> 02:09:54.640]  If it's busy, leave your name and number.
[02:09:54.660 --> 02:09:55.561]  They'll call you right back.
[02:09:57.101 --> 02:09:58.702]  888-803-4438.
[02:10:01.223 --> 02:10:03.344]  Jim Shepard, thanks for coming on the show, my friend.
[02:10:03.485 --> 02:10:04.445]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:10:04.525 --> 02:10:04.785]  You bet.
[02:10:04.805 --> 02:10:05.305]  We'll see you.
[02:10:05.345 --> 02:10:05.766]  God bless.
[02:10:06.286 --> 02:10:12.169]  Jim is the biggest sponsor of this show, and we really appreciate him, and we hope you take advantage of it.
[02:10:12.189 --> 02:10:13.069]  Okay, let's go to the calls.
[02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:14.130]  Thank you for holding.
[02:10:16.231 --> 02:10:16.791]  Pardon me, Mark?
[02:10:18.744 --> 02:10:19.144]  Okay.
[02:10:19.604 --> 02:10:21.785]  Bob in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:10:22.345 --> 02:10:25.406]  We actually have on Wyatt, so call back, Wyatt.
[02:10:25.466 --> 02:10:26.906]  Bob in Florida, go ahead.
[02:10:27.406 --> 02:10:28.347]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:10:28.367 --> 02:10:29.087]  Thanks for holding.
[02:10:29.107 --> 02:10:29.447]  Go ahead.
[02:10:29.467 --> 02:10:30.667]  No problem.
[02:10:31.288 --> 02:10:31.828]  Two points.
[02:10:31.848 --> 02:10:43.311]  Today you were talking about the Council of Foreign Relations, and it just amazes me that there are people that don't believe the organization exists, especially when you can tune in to C-SPAN, as I at times do.
[02:10:44.213 --> 02:11:00.297]  And see somebody standing behind the podium, and in front of the podium is a plaque that says Council of Foreign Relations, and behind the speaker is a large curtain that has, you know, written in various places, multiple appearances of Council of Foreign Relations.
[02:11:00.417 --> 02:11:04.157]  A blue curtain with a white shield that says CFR is what they use a lot.
[02:11:04.317 --> 02:11:06.358]  Yeah, you know, so it's just amazing.
[02:11:07.078 --> 02:11:14.323]  Second point is, yesterday you were reading an article from a news about bio-research warfare installations.
[02:11:14.443 --> 02:11:19.206]  Yeah, they're going to build dozens of them, level four, that don't even treat supposed bio-weapons.
[02:11:19.426 --> 02:11:24.750]  This is a giant launch, expansion of the ongoing biological weapons program.
[02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:28.012]  In the article you were stymied by a word, NIMBYism?
[02:11:28.472 --> 02:11:28.752]  Yes.
[02:11:29.092 --> 02:11:30.113]  Okay, do you know what that is?
[02:11:30.593 --> 02:11:31.474]  No, I didn't look it up.
[02:11:31.714 --> 02:11:33.475]  Okay, it's an acronym.
[02:11:33.795 --> 02:11:34.276]  Okay, it's...
[02:11:35.505 --> 02:11:38.647]  An acronym for Not In My Backyard.
[02:11:39.908 --> 02:11:40.908]  Ah, it's a new word.
[02:11:40.968 --> 02:11:41.389]  I got you.
[02:11:41.929 --> 02:11:47.893]  In the ecology movement over the last 20 years, it's crept into existence.
[02:11:48.073 --> 02:11:50.694]  I just wonder, was that capitalized or in lowercase letters?
[02:11:51.575 --> 02:11:53.236]  So that's a new word then.
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:55.041]  Well, yeah, that's an acronym.
[02:11:55.061 --> 02:11:57.904]  I'm sure it'll appear in the modern Webster's Dictionary.
[02:11:57.964 --> 02:12:01.687]  But did you, when you read it, was it in all capital letters?
[02:12:02.188 --> 02:12:02.508]  No.
[02:12:02.989 --> 02:12:04.390]  So it's in lowercase letters.
[02:12:04.510 --> 02:12:05.831]  I was just curious about that.
[02:12:05.891 --> 02:12:08.894]  In fact, I'm going to re-recover that article because it's so important.
[02:12:09.315 --> 02:12:15.480]  This BioShield, $6.3 billion a year, that's $12.6 in two years.
[02:12:16.021 --> 02:12:17.703]  In four years, it's like $26 million.
[02:12:19.682 --> 02:12:27.370]  Billion dollars to build giant bioweapons plants, this bioweapons program, and to set up a bureaucracy to forcibly inject us.
[02:12:28.090 --> 02:12:35.237]  And I've got them here today where the government admits they... Here it is, Associated Press, July 1st.
[02:12:36.218 --> 02:12:39.001]  Pentagon reveals secret biochem test.
[02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:40.781]  On thousands of troops.
[02:12:41.322 --> 02:12:42.663]  They could care less about us.
[02:12:43.344 --> 02:12:44.365]  They are the terrorists.
[02:12:45.066 --> 02:12:46.788]  I mean, how people deny this.
[02:12:46.808 --> 02:12:48.289]  You're living in La La Land, people.
[02:12:48.329 --> 02:12:51.032]  Yes, there are monsters, and they run the government.
[02:12:51.733 --> 02:12:52.854]  They look at you as cattle.
[02:12:52.894 --> 02:12:54.055]  That's why they're in control.
[02:12:54.295 --> 02:12:57.117]  Because they're ruthless, and they bred you to be stupid.
[02:12:57.398 --> 02:12:58.619]  Hey, one other thing, Alex.
[02:12:58.939 --> 02:13:03.322]  This big channel is running an excellent documentary series on Rome this week, it seems.
[02:13:04.083 --> 02:13:04.964]  They might want to tune in.
[02:13:05.024 --> 02:13:05.784]  Yeah, all right.
[02:13:05.824 --> 02:13:06.565]  Thanks for the call.
[02:13:06.605 --> 02:13:07.726]  Appreciate it.
[02:13:07.926 --> 02:13:14.911]  Let's come back, and we'll talk to Joe and Harold and Wyatt and others.
[02:13:14.931 --> 02:13:15.432]  Stay with us.
[02:13:16.161 --> 02:13:24.767]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:13:24.987 --> 02:13:36.255]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:13:36.475 --> 02:13:39.137]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:13:39.477 --> 02:13:43.580]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:45.942]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:13:46.083 --> 02:13:47.964]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:13:48.165 --> 02:13:54.191]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[02:13:54.431 --> 02:14:00.057]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:14:00.417 --> 02:14:04.359]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:14:04.379 --> 02:14:05.079]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:14:05.099 --> 02:14:06.080]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:14:16.661 --> 02:14:18.202]  Hey folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:14:18.462 --> 02:14:23.165]  Have you ever had someone pass you in the hallway or maybe in your office and they say to you, you look tired?
[02:14:23.365 --> 02:14:27.648]  They might as well have said you look awful because nobody looks or feels their best when they're tired.
[02:14:27.948 --> 02:14:34.272]  I want to tell you about Be Alive Royal Jelly because it can give your body the extra energy it needs to fight that too tired feeling.
[02:14:34.573 --> 02:14:41.257]  Fresh from nature, not from a laboratory, Be Alive Royal Jelly is a safe and natural way to give your body the extra energy it needs.
[02:14:41.537 --> 02:14:46.542]  Call toll-free 1-866-543-7900 to discover more.
[02:14:46.682 --> 02:14:48.964]  That's 1-866-543-7900.
[02:14:49.345 --> 02:14:52.268]  You won't find the Alive Royal Jelly in a store.
[02:14:52.388 --> 02:14:55.130]  It's much too fresh and much too precious to sit on a shelf.
[02:14:55.431 --> 02:14:55.651]  Call 1-866-543-7900.
[02:14:55.671 --> 02:14:57.573]  Toll-free to have it delivered right to your doorstep.
[02:14:57.593 --> 02:14:57.933]  That's 1-866-543-7900.
[02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:05.080]  I think.
[02:15:16.284 --> 02:15:16.844]  We're good to go.
[02:15:39.172 --> 02:15:39.572]  1-800-686-2237 That's 1-800-686-2237
[02:16:05.268 --> 02:16:08.310]  Coin values are always changing, and so is the Redbook guide to U.S.
[02:16:08.370 --> 02:16:08.730]  coins.
[02:16:09.130 --> 02:16:10.791]  Get the 2003 edition today.
[02:16:11.032 --> 02:16:11.592]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:16:11.692 --> 02:16:21.378]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:16:22.094 --> 02:16:29.577]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[02:16:29.817 --> 02:16:37.079]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:16:37.339 --> 02:16:41.521]  Potassium iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[02:16:41.681 --> 02:16:42.262]  We're good to go.
[02:17:05.519 --> 02:17:08.561]  Call toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:17:09.262 --> 02:17:10.743]  Call now and get free shipping.
[02:17:10.983 --> 02:17:13.625]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:17:21.710 --> 02:17:22.971]  Alex Jones back live.
[02:17:23.011 --> 02:17:24.532]  Let's move these calls quickly.
[02:17:24.552 --> 02:17:27.914]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wyatt in Maryland.
[02:17:28.094 --> 02:17:28.715]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:17:28.735 --> 02:17:29.335]  You're on the air.
[02:17:30.136 --> 02:17:31.297]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:17:31.317 --> 02:17:31.677]  Can you hear me?
[02:17:32.376 --> 02:17:32.777]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:32.877 --> 02:17:33.197]  Oh, good.
[02:17:33.277 --> 02:17:33.537]  Okay.
[02:17:33.857 --> 02:17:45.888]  Yes, it was really interesting that you talked about Harry Potter because I just put in a video called Harry Potter Witchcraft Repackaged, Making Evil Look Innocent at about 11 o'clock and it runs for 60 minutes.
[02:17:46.408 --> 02:17:54.535]  And it's an excellent film and video if any of your listeners don't have a working knowledge of what the Harry Potter books are all about.
[02:17:54.555 --> 02:17:57.978]  Yeah, we've run similar documentaries before.
[02:17:58.832 --> 02:18:01.114]  That's the lady who narrates that, right?
[02:18:01.474 --> 02:18:02.815]  What's her name?
[02:18:02.895 --> 02:18:04.637]  I forget her name.
[02:18:05.537 --> 02:18:11.242]  Well, it's jeremiahfilms.com and Bancuccio, I believe her last name is.
[02:18:11.262 --> 02:18:14.905]  Her and her husband make these films.
[02:18:14.985 --> 02:18:16.586]  It's jeremiahfilms.com.
[02:18:16.626 --> 02:18:17.487]  Yeah, they're good folks.
[02:18:17.607 --> 02:18:18.628]  I'll have to have them back on.
[02:18:18.668 --> 02:18:20.089]  What else is on your mind?
[02:18:20.529 --> 02:18:27.495]  Well, I thought that was pretty interesting that here I am watching this and then boom, it pops up on your show and it's
[02:18:29.738 --> 02:18:36.421]  The caller to call, they sounded like he had a little information, but he was very reluctant to accept some of the basic stuff.
[02:18:38.301 --> 02:18:40.502]  Well, that's pretty much what I wanted to talk about.
[02:18:41.783 --> 02:18:55.489]  Remember in your video, 9-11, when the French film crew was on the street filming and they filmed the first plane hit the first building and the smoke erupted.
[02:18:55.689 --> 02:18:56.810]  And then when the film crew
[02:18:58.942 --> 02:19:00.063]  Camera pulled back.
[02:19:00.763 --> 02:19:03.864]  I mentioned to you before that I saw... There's a white chase plane.
[02:19:04.304 --> 02:19:05.665]  Well, there was a plane that went through.
[02:19:06.045 --> 02:19:26.374]  But what I'm thinking of is that if the CIA was running their so-called tests or simulations of an attack, that was probably the plane used in the simulated attacks that the CIA had to cover so that they could have NORAD...
[02:19:27.850 --> 02:19:30.572]  We'll stand down or whatever the prevailing orders were.
[02:19:30.713 --> 02:19:33.855]  And for those that don't know, it's Associated Press.
[02:19:33.895 --> 02:19:41.462]  The CIA just so happened that morning at 8.30 throughout the event to be running a simulation of hijacked jet airliners.
[02:19:41.482 --> 02:19:42.683]  Now, that was the first report later.
[02:19:42.703 --> 02:19:47.988]  It was, oh, just a drill of a jetliner off course hitting New York and D.C.
[02:19:48.028 --> 02:19:51.912]  But this is how they ordered NORAD to stand down for over an hour
[02:19:52.712 --> 02:19:55.113]  And remember Payne Stewart, the golfer, 18 minutes.
[02:19:55.153 --> 02:20:02.396]  He was surrounded by F-16s in the Midwest, the most uncontrolled airspace, but over in the most controlled New York, D.C.
[02:20:02.976 --> 02:20:04.656]  Hours this is going on.
[02:20:04.797 --> 02:20:10.178]  Everything is ordered to stand down because the CIA was running a drill that morning.
[02:20:10.699 --> 02:20:13.860]  Yeah, I talked to him soon after the...
[02:20:14.930 --> 02:20:17.012]  9-11, the Pentagon got hit.
[02:20:17.052 --> 02:20:22.637]  I was over in the Washington area, and I was talking to an Air Force pilot who was in my car.
[02:20:22.677 --> 02:20:26.040]  I was working BWI Transportation at the time.
[02:20:26.660 --> 02:20:33.586]  And he told me, he said, that had to be some kind of fighter jock to make that plane hit that building, the Pentagon.
[02:20:34.418 --> 02:20:35.079]  Where he hit it.
[02:20:35.119 --> 02:20:39.543]  He said he had to do a maneuver that was almost impossible for a fighter jet.
[02:20:39.724 --> 02:20:41.866]  Well, plus it was pulling over six Gs.
[02:20:41.986 --> 02:20:43.227]  Well, that was about seven.
[02:20:43.688 --> 02:20:46.090]  One of the tower hits would be six Gs in the turn.
[02:20:46.470 --> 02:20:48.953]  And these guys supposedly couldn't even fly Cessnas.
[02:20:49.273 --> 02:20:49.914]  Thanks for the call.
[02:20:50.945 --> 02:20:54.267]  And that's after overpowering pilots with box cutters.
[02:20:54.407 --> 02:21:01.770]  And then nine of the hijackers turned out to be alive, and the others had their houses and cars and credit cards paid for by the FBI, and they were trying to get U.S.
[02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:02.610]  military bases.
[02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:04.271]  All confirmed, all mainstream.
[02:21:04.491 --> 02:21:05.471]  It goes on for hours.
[02:21:05.692 --> 02:21:07.052]  Public officials know not to fly.
[02:21:07.352 --> 02:21:14.055]  San Francisco Chronicle, Times of London, on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[02:21:14.075 --> 02:21:15.756]  That's why I've made two films and written a book.
[02:21:16.657 --> 02:21:17.598]  Bob in Florida.
[02:21:18.038 --> 02:21:19.079]  No, we already went to Bob in Florida.
[02:21:19.099 --> 02:21:23.202]  Now we're going to Joe in New York and others.
[02:21:23.542 --> 02:21:26.965]  Harold, or is it... Who is in... I keep getting that name wrong, Mark.
[02:21:27.685 --> 02:21:28.886]  Who's in Tennessee or Texas?
[02:21:31.568 --> 02:21:32.369]  Howard, Texas.
[02:21:32.429 --> 02:21:33.529]  Joe, Texas.
[02:21:34.130 --> 02:21:35.971]  And a bunch of other people I don't know anymore.
[02:21:36.792 --> 02:21:37.612]  Joe in New York.
[02:21:37.652 --> 02:21:38.233]  You're on the air.
[02:21:38.273 --> 02:21:38.733]  Go ahead.
[02:21:39.093 --> 02:21:39.834]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[02:21:40.034 --> 02:21:40.835]  How you doing?
[02:21:40.915 --> 02:21:43.116]  I don't know if I'm ahead of the curve or if I'm way behind.
[02:21:43.136 --> 02:21:45.238]  What about if you would...
[02:21:45.917 --> 02:21:51.442]  Sit down and give a dissertation on all of the Bill of Rights, all the Ten Amendments.
[02:21:52.043 --> 02:22:08.879]  In other words, instead of having somebody drive around and listening to Lord Limbo or just some innocuous nonsense on the radio, they can have this CD or this cassette in their car listening to it over and over again to get a full grasp of what our constitutional rights mean to us and how we should apply them.
[02:22:10.660 --> 02:22:11.361]  What's your thought on that?
[02:22:12.797 --> 02:22:14.318]  I would love to do something like that.
[02:22:14.358 --> 02:22:16.119]  I thought about a video where I do that.
[02:22:16.239 --> 02:22:18.200]  Others have done it, but I'd like to do it.
[02:22:18.661 --> 02:22:20.342]  And just all time and energy.
[02:22:20.382 --> 02:22:22.143]  I mean, I'm on the radio this morning.
[02:22:22.183 --> 02:22:23.884]  I'm on my own show.
[02:22:24.364 --> 02:22:26.245]  I'll be doing several interviews today.
[02:22:26.906 --> 02:22:30.608]  This on top of paying bills and buying groceries and walking the dog.
[02:22:30.648 --> 02:22:32.069]  I mean, my life is pure work.
[02:22:32.990 --> 02:22:35.871]  And I need other good folks to put this type of information out.
[02:22:35.911 --> 02:22:38.073]  But yes, and people have done that.
[02:22:39.059 --> 02:22:43.841]  It's just that it's up to listeners to get the materials, to make the copies, to get them out to the people, Joe.
[02:22:44.402 --> 02:22:45.302]  Right on.
[02:22:45.422 --> 02:22:46.603]  Did you want to add anything else?
[02:22:47.043 --> 02:22:48.424]  Yeah.
[02:22:48.544 --> 02:22:48.844]  Stay there.
[02:22:48.884 --> 02:22:49.324]  Don't hang up.
[02:22:49.344 --> 02:22:54.407]  We'll come back to Joe and then everybody else who's patiently holding.
[02:22:54.447 --> 02:22:55.547]  Just stay with us, folks.
[02:22:56.248 --> 02:22:57.068]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:22:57.108 --> 02:23:02.451]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:23:02.551 --> 02:23:04.692]  More real news and information straight ahead.
[02:23:05.988 --> 02:23:06.929]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.369 --> 02:23:09.030]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.090 --> 02:23:12.693]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:16.036 --> 02:23:17.016]  Toxins are everywhere.
[02:23:17.036 --> 02:23:19.638]  They're in the air you breathe, in the food you eat, in the water you drink.
[02:23:19.858 --> 02:23:24.382]  And as a result, illness and disease have increased to the point that eventually we're all going to get sick with something.
[02:23:24.522 --> 02:23:26.744]  Unless we find a way to get these toxins in the... 803-4438.
[02:23:26.784 --> 02:23:27.885]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:54.552]  All right, my friends, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:23:54.592 --> 02:24:04.558]  Let's let Joe in New York finish up, and we're going to go to folks in Texas and Missouri and Illinois and all points in between, basically.
[02:24:05.238 --> 02:24:08.280]  Go ahead, Joe, and finish up the point we're making.
[02:24:10.081 --> 02:24:13.844]  Oh, he's gone, and I'm being told here.
[02:24:14.764 --> 02:24:18.747]  Joe, I told you three times, hold over, and then I wasn't told he was gone.
[02:24:19.527 --> 02:24:20.628]  Well, who's up next then?
[02:24:21.974 --> 02:24:23.555]  Howard in Texas.
[02:24:23.575 --> 02:24:24.376]  You're on the air.
[02:24:24.416 --> 02:24:24.776]  Welcome.
[02:24:25.396 --> 02:24:27.178]  Well, Alex, you're doing a good job.
[02:24:27.678 --> 02:24:28.318]  Well, thank you.
[02:24:28.579 --> 02:24:31.981]  Hey, Alex, people need to understand something.
[02:24:33.902 --> 02:24:41.047]  What you're saying to people is, tyranny is like a rotten, nasty cake.
[02:24:41.988 --> 02:24:46.071]  And through centuries, the frosting gets changed.
[02:24:46.811 --> 02:24:50.534]  And everybody licks the frosting and goes, hmm, that looks good.
[02:24:51.383 --> 02:24:57.105]  Until some, like our founding fathers, go through the frosty, it's the frosty not alive.
[02:24:57.126 --> 02:25:01.307]  Go through the frosty and go, whoa, look what's on the next turn.
[02:25:02.528 --> 02:25:04.949]  Whether, you know, inquisition, the same way.
[02:25:05.569 --> 02:25:10.151]  We had inquisitions over a thousand years ago, and through the centuries they change them.
[02:25:10.551 --> 02:25:12.492]  But an inquisition's an inquisition.
[02:25:13.413 --> 02:25:19.055]  What our corrupt government officials are doing is setting up
[02:25:20.057 --> 02:25:30.623]  Well, they've got more, it's a great point, they've got more sophisticated forms of propaganda, but at the same time, America's being used as the muscle.
[02:25:40.649 --> 02:25:42.850]  For this new inquisition.
[02:25:42.911 --> 02:25:52.137]  We're being used as the energy source, and then the UN and Europe acts like they're against all this when they're actually the owners of the system that is profiting.
[02:25:55.959 --> 02:26:00.822]  Yeah, so, you know, that's why I... You know, that's what you've been telling people.
[02:26:01.623 --> 02:26:02.463]  And that's good.
[02:26:03.104 --> 02:26:09.328]  And not only that, I was reading a San Antonio newspaper, and what's interesting, Alex, is
[02:26:09.801 --> 02:26:10.782]  It says, fire it.
[02:26:11.862 --> 02:26:14.244]  Put a good spin on job hunting.
[02:26:15.605 --> 02:26:20.088]  Now, what happened was this person got terminated after 15 years of work.
[02:26:21.269 --> 02:26:29.294]  What this person is told by Carol Kleeman is, first of all, say never you were terminated or fired.
[02:26:30.155 --> 02:26:34.317]  Sir, I'm having trouble understanding exactly the story you're saying or what you're telling us.
[02:26:34.337 --> 02:26:34.838]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:26:35.338 --> 02:26:39.581]  It's basically telling what it is I'm reading about job hunting.
[02:26:40.197 --> 02:26:43.218]  And what these people in the newspapers are telling people to do is lie.
[02:26:44.018 --> 02:26:48.100]  And I'm like... And that's exactly... They're putting a new spin.
[02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:50.241]  A spin on job hunting.
[02:26:50.701 --> 02:26:53.682]  And it's a spin like what the government does when it lies.
[02:26:53.702 --> 02:26:56.083]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:26:56.283 --> 02:26:58.443]  They're on the news saying lying's good.
[02:26:58.504 --> 02:27:01.164]  They're on the news saying torture's a new virtue.
[02:27:01.204 --> 02:27:01.965]  That's a headline.
[02:27:02.205 --> 02:27:04.146]  And it's good to lie to find a job.
[02:27:05.826 --> 02:27:06.706]  Yeah, no, that's it.
[02:27:06.766 --> 02:27:07.607]  You're right.
[02:27:07.647 --> 02:27:07.847]  They're...
[02:27:09.116 --> 02:27:13.278]  They're training us that lying and corruption is good and being decent is bad.
[02:27:13.298 --> 02:27:14.098]  That's right.
[02:27:14.618 --> 02:27:14.838]  All right.
[02:27:14.858 --> 02:27:15.478]  Good to hear from you.
[02:27:15.518 --> 02:27:16.319]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[02:27:16.359 --> 02:27:16.679]  All righty.
[02:27:16.699 --> 02:27:17.639]  Appreciate you holding.
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:19.460]  Joe in Texas.
[02:27:19.740 --> 02:27:20.440]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:21.041]  You're on the air.
[02:27:21.501 --> 02:27:21.941]  Hey, Alex.
[02:27:21.961 --> 02:27:22.461]  How are you doing?
[02:27:22.701 --> 02:27:23.742]  I'm fantastic, sir.
[02:27:23.922 --> 02:27:28.843]  I haven't had a chance to call in the last few days, so I'm going to try to run through a couple of things pretty fast here.
[02:27:29.784 --> 02:27:30.524]  I'm from Waco.
[02:27:31.104 --> 02:27:35.266]  I write to you all the time, send you tips in the email, and I'm a big supporter of yours.
[02:27:36.807 --> 02:27:43.333]  I'm Hispanic, and I've mentioned that several times to you, but you're right about all the illegal immigration.
[02:27:43.733 --> 02:27:44.794]  They're trying to make it racial.
[02:27:44.954 --> 02:28:00.548]  The media, I was watching Texas Cable News Network today, and they had a story about the illegal immigrants coming into the United States and that the main group of people who are against it are African Americans.
[02:28:01.469 --> 02:28:02.810]  I mean, they just threw that out there.
[02:28:03.496 --> 02:28:06.138]  There really wasn't any point to the story other than to say that.
[02:28:06.839 --> 02:28:12.283]  Well, look, I mean, we've gone over this and over it, and the media tries to spin it, and I've said this over and over again.
[02:28:12.943 --> 02:28:17.487]  If Russia bordered us, it would be better because we can more effectively fight this.
[02:28:18.791 --> 02:28:35.400]  If a nation of lily-white people... I mean, folks, in Mexico, because of the tyranny, going back to the Aztecs, and then with the Spanish, and then with Santa Ana, and the PRI, and all the stuff we've seen...
[02:28:36.685 --> 02:28:42.251]  I mean, the people are totally poor, just absolutely enslaved in many areas of the country.
[02:28:42.271 --> 02:28:44.273]  You have more billionaires there than per capita.
[02:28:44.293 --> 02:28:45.654]  They didn't make their money the honest way.
[02:28:45.694 --> 02:28:50.399]  They made it stealing from the Mexican people, making deals with the corrupt bankers in New York.
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:54.023]  And the corrupt bankers have said they want the borders open.
[02:28:54.063 --> 02:28:54.544]  The U.N.
[02:28:54.564 --> 02:28:55.064]  has said it.
[02:28:56.105 --> 02:28:59.749]  And while they're at it, they're also going to cause balkanization.
[02:29:00.399 --> 02:29:17.466]  I mean, if we didn't have the media and the culture trying to turn everybody against each other, and if we went in and said all these illegals guaranteed have to be paid what everybody else is, and if we did all these special things and made sure they learned English and made sure they learned the Bill of Rights and Constitution, it wouldn't be a problem.
[02:29:17.806 --> 02:29:19.087]  But none of that's happening.
[02:29:19.447 --> 02:29:29.571]  All the bad things are happening to break this country down, and we're always talking about Hispanics from Latin America because that's the 400 million that border us.
[02:29:30.371 --> 02:29:31.652]  We also talk about Canada.
[02:29:31.712 --> 02:29:34.815]  We can fly in from Russia, China, the organized crime.
[02:29:35.095 --> 02:29:36.396]  They're worse per capita.
[02:29:37.097 --> 02:29:40.379]  The white Russians are worse than anybody per capita for crime rates.
[02:29:40.739 --> 02:29:44.162]  But still, it's hundreds of thousands of them, not tens of millions.
[02:29:44.182 --> 02:29:45.143]  And I'm glad you see it.
[02:29:45.223 --> 02:29:50.187]  But again, you see a news report, and they try to get blacks against Hispanics.
[02:29:50.367 --> 02:29:54.570]  I mean, it's every combination you can imagine.
[02:29:54.610 --> 02:29:55.471]  Go ahead.
[02:29:55.491 --> 02:29:56.252]  The second thing is...
[02:29:57.572 --> 02:30:10.517]  When I was watching Wolf Blitzer on CNN, when they broke in like every few minutes saying breaking news, that centrifuge, when they found that centrifuge, it was just so funny how they built it up so big.
[02:30:10.937 --> 02:30:21.181]  And then even in their story, they said that it was 12 years old, that the guy dug it up in his backyard, and it could possibly be used in nuclear weapons programs.
[02:30:22.842 --> 02:30:26.623]  But the whole buildup to it is, you know, we found the weapons of mass destruction, a smoking gun.
[02:30:27.958 --> 02:30:35.264]  Yeah, and then on prisonplanet.com, I don't know if you saw it, Joe, but we posted a photo of a U.S.
[02:30:35.425 --> 02:30:36.946]  nuclear centrifuge lab.
[02:30:37.086 --> 02:30:39.668]  The thing covers like dozens of football fields.
[02:30:39.868 --> 02:30:40.229]  Oh, yeah.
[02:30:40.309 --> 02:30:45.153]  It's a gigantic factory, and then they find some thing that looks like an oil pan.
[02:30:45.293 --> 02:30:45.653]  It did.
[02:30:45.814 --> 02:30:46.294]  It really did.
[02:30:46.534 --> 02:30:53.118]  Buried in somebody's yard, and two weeks before that they said, we're going to start paying off Iraqi scientists to, quote, give us the evidence.
[02:30:53.158 --> 02:30:55.219]  Well, you're going to get a million bucks.
[02:30:55.379 --> 02:30:57.440]  One guy got 15 million.
[02:30:57.480 --> 02:30:57.880]  Remember that?
[02:30:58.261 --> 02:30:58.801]  Yeah.
[02:30:58.981 --> 02:31:05.445]  I mean, if you're going to get 15 million, a million, whatever, the average person, oh, look, I got an oil pan, and the news goes possibly.
[02:31:05.465 --> 02:31:07.846]  Now, before they'd say these are bioweapons trucks.
[02:31:08.346 --> 02:31:09.947]  And then just leave it alone when it was just proven.
[02:31:10.327 --> 02:31:13.789]  Now they say this is possible because they've lost so much credibility.
[02:31:14.730 --> 02:31:22.214]  And I tell all my friends and family, I said, okay, you hear the big story, but you don't hear the retraction later on.
[02:31:22.254 --> 02:31:26.217]  And it's always a couple of days later, and it's very low key.
[02:31:26.377 --> 02:31:27.377]  Now let me give you an example.
[02:31:27.417 --> 02:31:33.061]  The statesman said that we had, what was it, I don't know, 100 people at our rally.
[02:31:33.361 --> 02:31:34.782]  I went down, showed them video.
[02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:35.820]  Yeah.
[02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:35.940]  Yeah.
[02:31:55.179 --> 02:31:57.080]  Oh, and I've been meaning to tell you this story.
[02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:07.323]  In this one publication I get called The Week, where they have weekly stories, it mentioned how the kid who won the National Geographic was a homeschooled kid.
[02:32:08.123 --> 02:32:09.503]  But, of course, that wasn't major news.
[02:32:09.563 --> 02:32:10.864]  It was just a little small article.
[02:32:11.444 --> 02:32:19.326]  Well, I have to tell you, when I see it in the Chicago Tribune or somewhere else, they will say they're winning and then attack homeschooling.
[02:32:19.646 --> 02:32:19.886]  Oh, yeah.
[02:32:20.754 --> 02:32:30.578]  Oh, yeah, and then the very last thing I have to tell you is when I saw the Hulk, when I went to go see the Hulk, one of the major military characters in the movie was wearing a blue beret.
[02:32:31.179 --> 02:32:34.000]  Even though it was the United States military, he was wearing a blue beret.
[02:32:34.731 --> 02:32:36.351]  And he, of course, was the commander.
[02:32:36.571 --> 02:32:37.532]  Oh, yeah, he was the commander.
[02:32:37.732 --> 02:32:38.372]  The U.N.
[02:32:38.412 --> 02:32:39.372]  is always the boss.
[02:32:39.652 --> 02:32:40.232]  Yeah.
[02:32:40.352 --> 02:32:47.494]  Oh, yeah, and another thing as far as that on TV shows, on The Wire, this new cop show, it's based in, I think, Baltimore, Maryland.
[02:32:49.254 --> 02:32:58.497]  The detective went to some federal agency, and I'm not actually sure what it was, but they showed them taking down the old sign and putting up the Department of Homeland Security sign.
[02:32:59.137 --> 02:33:04.018]  And even though the plot and the story has nothing really to do with Homeland Security, they just throw that in there.
[02:33:05.084 --> 02:33:06.484]  Yeah, I'm glad you see this.
[02:33:06.504 --> 02:33:17.047]  This is the type of call I like, Joe, because you're hitting all these different points, and it overwhelms me until I turn into basically a jabbering idiot, because it's just so many lies, so many propaganda.
[02:33:17.067 --> 02:33:24.008]  When you've been studying it, you see it everywhere, and in the Hulk at the end, the guy gives this anti-government speech, the evil guy.
[02:33:24.348 --> 02:33:24.628]  Oh, yeah.
[02:33:25.308 --> 02:33:26.729]  He gives his anti-government speech.
[02:33:26.749 --> 02:33:27.589]  Let me give you another example.
[02:33:27.609 --> 02:33:28.349]  I have this on tape.
[02:33:29.389 --> 02:33:30.970]  They have one of these talk shows.
[02:33:31.410 --> 02:33:32.650]  What is he, Jerry Springer?
[02:33:33.593 --> 02:33:40.100]  And they have a Klan member on there who's black, and he hates black people.
[02:33:41.501 --> 02:33:50.069]  Yeah, but he says that there's a New World Order enslaving everybody, and that it's a world government that's all coming down on us.
[02:33:50.149 --> 02:33:53.452]  By the way, he hates, you know, N-N-N-N-N.
[02:33:53.853 --> 02:33:56.976]  So now when somebody hears New World Order, you see, they think that it's...
[02:33:57.893 --> 02:33:58.454]  It's amazing.
[02:33:58.474 --> 02:34:02.261]  So now the black community, here's a black man standing up and warning about the New World Order.
[02:34:02.622 --> 02:34:06.950]  They saw Jerry Springer with somebody screaming, I hate black people.
[02:34:07.210 --> 02:34:09.635]  You're dumb because you don't believe in the New World Order.
[02:34:09.895 --> 02:34:10.036]  Yeah.
[02:34:10.862 --> 02:34:18.964]  I'm glad you mentioned New World Order because it reminded me there was a news blurb about a TV show that's trying to be developed.
[02:34:19.444 --> 02:34:31.928]  It's called NYPD 2026, and it's a story about a cop in present day who gets cryogenically frozen and gets thawed out in the year 2026, and they have to reintegrate him into the New World Order.
[02:34:32.631 --> 02:34:34.952]  I mean, that's like the pilot synopsis.
[02:34:35.292 --> 02:34:36.432]  They said New World Order.
[02:34:36.452 --> 02:34:37.592]  They said New World Order.
[02:34:37.772 --> 02:34:42.353]  But Rush Limbaugh says there is no CFR, there is no New World Order.
[02:34:42.894 --> 02:34:44.074]  It's a kook detector.
[02:34:44.354 --> 02:34:48.615]  If you talk about RIPs publicly on the news, say and give all your rights up, Joe.
[02:34:48.695 --> 02:34:49.015]  Oh, yeah.
[02:34:49.615 --> 02:34:50.015]  Definitely.
[02:34:50.716 --> 02:34:53.416]  Keep up the good work, Alex, and I'll keep sending you tips when I get them.
[02:34:53.656 --> 02:34:53.976]  All right.
[02:34:54.036 --> 02:34:55.757]  Thanks for the emails and information, sir.
[02:34:55.917 --> 02:34:56.537]  Absolutely.
[02:34:57.237 --> 02:34:59.138]  Let's talk to Tom in Missouri.
[02:34:59.198 --> 02:34:59.898]  Tom, thanks for holding.
[02:34:59.938 --> 02:35:00.358]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:35:00.979 --> 02:35:01.459]  Hi, Alex.
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:03.020]  Long-time listener.
[02:35:03.701 --> 02:35:11.905]  Alex, some information I'd like to get out I think might interest some of the ham radio operators that listen to your broadcast and shortwave.
[02:35:12.365 --> 02:35:28.014]  You know, on July 3rd, the FCC authorizes five new channels in the 5 MHz band, and that's where all of the Homeland Security long-range communications, all of the federal users, they're all in these frequency ranges, Alex.
[02:35:28.114 --> 02:35:29.735]  I'm very suspicious of this.
[02:35:30.436 --> 02:35:42.545]  It's been a ham for 36 years, and I have never seen on one occasion where the FCC has allocated a frequency, not a frequency band, but actual individual channels.
[02:35:42.565 --> 02:35:44.086]  There's five channels allocated.
[02:35:44.686 --> 02:35:49.790]  And by the way, these are on a secondary allocation with federal users on a primary basis.
[02:35:50.851 --> 02:35:54.553]  Alex, I really am suspicious of this.
[02:35:54.713 --> 02:35:57.876]  I think what's going to happen here when these
[02:35:59.153 --> 02:36:00.653]  Well, I'll tell you why they've already stated they are.
[02:36:00.673 --> 02:36:02.654]  You didn't hear about Ridge's announcement?
[02:36:25.624 --> 02:36:26.784]  Well, yes, I have.
[02:36:26.945 --> 02:36:29.065]  But here's on a local basis here.
[02:36:29.105 --> 02:36:31.586]  Now, I've been in the communications business for 30 years.
[02:36:32.546 --> 02:36:34.947]  And I've worked with police departments in the past.
[02:36:35.027 --> 02:36:37.048]  I don't do business with them anymore.
[02:36:38.569 --> 02:36:42.310]  However, next town over, the city marshal is a friend of mine.
[02:36:42.350 --> 02:36:44.130]  He's also a part-time county deputy.
[02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:45.491]  We're in a very rural area here.
[02:36:46.624 --> 02:36:57.749]  He himself told me that when this system was installed, the high-frequency single sideband system was installed for long-range communications to the state capitol, Jefferson City, and all other counties.
[02:36:58.210 --> 02:37:02.132]  By the way, almost every county in Missouri has one now.
[02:37:02.172 --> 02:37:03.772]  This is the federal control grid.
[02:37:03.952 --> 02:37:04.353]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:04.873 --> 02:37:07.634]  It sure is, Alex, because I can guarantee you one thing.
[02:37:08.615 --> 02:37:13.057]  When the regular VHF and UHF two-way radio systems go down,
[02:37:13.874 --> 02:37:26.933]  These high-frequency single sideband systems will be the only thing working because they can easily, on 5 megahertz, communicate point-to-point hundreds of miles, daytime or nighttime.
[02:37:27.374 --> 02:37:29.357]  That's an optimum frequency to use.
[02:37:30.037 --> 02:37:33.900]  For statewide communications and even interstate communications.
[02:37:34.580 --> 02:37:40.804]  I know on those frequency ranges, I would think during the day you could transmit it and receive at least 300 miles.
[02:37:41.205 --> 02:37:43.166]  Well, they admit it's continuity of government.
[02:37:43.226 --> 02:37:46.508]  I mean, this is martial law being set up.
[02:37:46.868 --> 02:37:53.833]  Well, I'll also say that this city marshal, who's also the part-time deputy where I am in our county here,
[02:37:54.474 --> 02:37:58.978]  He told me that when they put that system in, he said they got some sort of a federal grant to do it.
[02:37:59.198 --> 02:38:00.680]  And he says, I don't know why they have it.
[02:38:00.740 --> 02:38:01.801]  I told him why they have it.
[02:38:02.061 --> 02:38:03.522]  And he says, yeah, you're probably right.
[02:38:03.562 --> 02:38:04.603]  But he starts laughing.
[02:38:04.643 --> 02:38:07.726]  He says, you know, there's nobody here that knows how to work it.
[02:38:08.287 --> 02:38:09.708]  He said, maybe they'll come to see you.
[02:38:09.748 --> 02:38:10.629]  I said, yeah, they might.
[02:38:11.930 --> 02:38:12.390]  I don't know.
[02:38:13.011 --> 02:38:15.053]  But I'm very suspicious of this.
[02:38:15.173 --> 02:38:18.216]  I can read just a few sentences out of a press release that might...
[02:38:20.123 --> 02:38:24.247]  Well, sure, but I mean, sir, there's a bill to federalize every city in the U.S.
[02:38:24.407 --> 02:38:27.489]  I mean, fully federalized.
[02:38:27.530 --> 02:38:28.070]  That's what I mean.
[02:38:28.110 --> 02:38:30.212]  Stuff's so bonkers right now.
[02:38:30.272 --> 02:38:30.712]  Go ahead.
[02:38:31.073 --> 02:38:39.080]  Well, Alex, you know, working a two-way radio in a police car, you just push the button on the microphone, you talk, you let go, and you listen.
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:44.845]  You get into these high-frequency systems, it takes a more skilled operator to understand what frequency to use and...
[02:38:45.994 --> 02:38:51.678]  Well, sir, I've seen headlines where it says, will ham radio operators be drafted during emergencies?
[02:38:51.739 --> 02:38:55.481]  So it's already being set up, and most of them are willingly going to be part of this.
[02:38:55.742 --> 02:38:58.884]  Most of them are mindless fools, unfortunately.
[02:38:58.924 --> 02:38:59.624]  That's the truth.
[02:39:00.605 --> 02:39:05.469]  But I really do think that they will be listening when these guys come on the air.
[02:39:07.570 --> 02:39:10.032]  By the way, it says here the NTIA.
[02:39:10.092 --> 02:39:13.535]  That's the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.
[02:39:14.377 --> 02:39:31.164]  It says the NTIA selected the channels with the FCC authorized to minimize the possibility of interference to federal government users and it dictated the use of upper sideband so that the federal government users who also use only upper sideband could readily identify amateur stations if necessary.
[02:39:31.604 --> 02:39:38.367]  And I think it's necessary because when my friend who's a county deputy told me nobody knows how to work that thing,
[02:39:39.039 --> 02:39:40.159]  They're going to need operators.
[02:39:40.179 --> 02:39:41.040]  They're going to need skilled operators.
[02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:43.261]  They've already said that, so you put two and two together.
[02:39:43.321 --> 02:39:43.761]  Good job.
[02:39:44.361 --> 02:39:45.442]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:39:45.482 --> 02:39:46.222]  I appreciate it, Tom.
[02:39:47.042 --> 02:39:48.363]  Let's talk to Dan in Illinois.
[02:39:48.403 --> 02:39:49.143]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:39:49.203 --> 02:39:49.603]  Go ahead.
[02:39:49.623 --> 02:39:50.804]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:39:50.964 --> 02:39:51.724]  Fantastic, sir.
[02:39:52.124 --> 02:40:02.829]  Listen, more proof that the global risk behind Europe is very apparent that right now the United States is the most aggressive and agitating country in the world right now with other people.
[02:40:04.149 --> 02:40:08.571]  And the fact that the United States is going to be the one leading the way to the road to peace
[02:40:09.733 --> 02:40:17.917]  And no one's complaining that why would a regime like this who's making war with everyone have any kind of plan for the Middle East?
[02:40:17.937 --> 02:40:25.301]  What they're doing is America's been, they've hijacked the country, the Europeans own our banks, they're using us to do the dirty work.
[02:40:25.341 --> 02:40:26.362]  It's good cop, bad cop.
[02:40:26.642 --> 02:40:26.822]  Right.
[02:40:27.102 --> 02:40:28.563]  But I mean, they're not even complaining.
[02:40:29.023 --> 02:40:34.146]  Why would somebody who's making war with everybody is the one who's going to have a plan for peace?
[02:40:35.874 --> 02:40:38.957]  Why don't they resurrect Hitler and Mussolini and invite him to that?
[02:40:39.277 --> 02:40:41.619]  Let me tell you how this works with Arafat and the rest of them.
[02:40:41.679 --> 02:40:43.341]  Arafat works for the Bilderberg Group.
[02:40:43.361 --> 02:40:45.403]  We've had major Jewish writers on the talk about it.
[02:40:46.087 --> 02:40:49.689]  They tell these Arab leaders, you do what we say or we're going to assassinate you.
[02:40:49.749 --> 02:40:50.870]  And they say, yes, sir.
[02:40:51.351 --> 02:40:52.791]  And they have these staged events.
[02:40:53.532 --> 02:41:00.657]  And Israel has been caught and has admitted, I'm talking United Press International, AP, carrying out the terror bombings.
[02:41:00.677 --> 02:41:01.857]  But it's in the back of the paper.
[02:41:02.418 --> 02:41:04.099]  Most of these bombings are the Israelis.
[02:41:04.659 --> 02:41:10.083]  And they do it to keep their people enslaved under their control and as an excuse to attack their neighbors.
[02:41:10.143 --> 02:41:10.843]  Anything else, Dan?
[02:41:11.544 --> 02:41:12.504]  They never find a body.
[02:41:12.524 --> 02:41:14.806]  They always say that there's a body, but they never find one.
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:16.081]  Right.
[02:41:16.701 --> 02:41:17.743]  Just once in a while they do.
[02:41:18.383 --> 02:41:19.164]  They got caught.
[02:41:19.224 --> 02:41:22.889]  I mean, sure, there's some copycat Muslims that do this, but very few.
[02:41:23.870 --> 02:41:25.312]  People just buy the illusion.
[02:41:25.612 --> 02:41:27.154]  You know, it's the cat and the hat.
[02:41:27.395 --> 02:41:28.396]  It's just an illusion.
[02:41:29.417 --> 02:41:30.559]  Pulling the rabbits out of hats.
[02:41:30.599 --> 02:41:31.039]  Thanks, Dan.
[02:41:31.079 --> 02:41:31.560]  Good points.
[02:41:32.141 --> 02:41:33.943]  I'll hit some final news in the final segment.
[02:41:33.963 --> 02:41:34.644]  Please stay with me.
[02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:47.826]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.

[02:42:36.778 --> 02:42:41.101]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:42:41.281 --> 02:42:45.724]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[02:42:45.864 --> 02:42:50.227]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:42:50.267 --> 02:42:51.628]  The New World Order.
[02:42:53.404 --> 02:42:57.627]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[02:43:10.376 --> 02:43:17.577]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:43:17.757 --> 02:43:23.119]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:44:32.245 --> 02:44:34.105]  We're good to go.
[02:44:34.125 --> 02:44:34.845]  We're good to go.
[02:45:02.575 --> 02:45:04.116]  It goes on and on.
[02:45:04.336 --> 02:45:06.678]  And what type of government do we have running things?
[02:45:07.098 --> 02:45:08.719]  This is from the Associated Press.
[02:45:09.339 --> 02:45:12.001]  Pentagon reveals secret biochem test.
[02:45:13.241 --> 02:45:25.628]  Several House members are asking Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to keep alive the Pentagon's investigation into 50 chemical and biological weapons tests in the 60s that involve 5,842 military personnel.
[02:45:26.029 --> 02:45:29.831]  By keeping the investigation open, they don't have to issue a report.
[02:45:30.743 --> 02:45:36.588]  Every week I see an article where they go, In 1985, Tampa was sprayed with a biological death resulted.
[02:45:36.888 --> 02:45:38.569]  Details remain classified.
[02:45:39.710 --> 02:45:41.892]  This just goes on all the time.
[02:45:42.252 --> 02:45:48.156]  The Defense Department released the findings of an investigation into Project 112 and Project Shad.
[02:45:48.196 --> 02:45:49.117]  We've had the troops on.
[02:45:49.577 --> 02:45:50.578]  Jets would fly over.
[02:45:50.638 --> 02:45:52.660]  They'd all start flopping around on the deck, vomiting.
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:54.241]  They'd pull into dock.
[02:45:54.281 --> 02:45:55.582]  People would hide from the ship.
[02:45:57.393 --> 02:46:03.674]  Sheds were conducted in 62 to 73 to test the combat capabilities of biological chemical agents and ways to protect U.S.
[02:46:03.694 --> 02:46:05.355]  troops from such attacks.
[02:46:05.455 --> 02:46:06.015]  Yeah, right.
[02:46:06.035 --> 02:46:07.375]  How to attack the American people.
[02:46:07.895 --> 02:46:08.735]  Why do you have U.S.
[02:46:08.775 --> 02:46:09.995]  Code Title 50, Shepard?
[02:46:13.916 --> 02:46:14.816]  Why do you have U.S.
[02:46:14.876 --> 02:46:15.196]  Code?
[02:46:18.797 --> 02:46:19.997]  Are we still on the air, guys?
[02:46:22.698 --> 02:46:23.398]  Or no tellin'?
[02:46:24.372 --> 02:46:27.254]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas, every once in a while.
[02:46:27.294 --> 02:46:30.397]  We thought out, oh, good, I'm on the air.
[02:46:30.417 --> 02:46:31.638]  I don't know if the listeners heard that.
[02:46:31.658 --> 02:46:34.160]  It felt like I got hit in the head with a bolt of lightning.
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:35.801]  Trying to continue here.
[02:46:35.841 --> 02:46:36.622]  I'm here in Austin.
[02:46:36.642 --> 02:46:38.723]  They're up in Minnesota, and the connection sometimes has a problem.
[02:46:39.744 --> 02:46:41.725]  Pentagon reveals secret biochem test.
[02:46:43.514 --> 02:46:43.774]  U.S.
[02:46:43.814 --> 02:46:55.262]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B authorizes the use of lethal chemical weapons on the American people for any reason, including crowd control.
[02:46:55.403 --> 02:46:55.823]  And they do.
[02:46:55.843 --> 02:46:56.723]  They put it in the water.
[02:46:57.064 --> 02:46:57.984]  They spray it on us.
[02:46:58.004 --> 02:46:58.825]  They think it's real funny.
[02:47:00.268 --> 02:47:03.991]  Some include releases of deadly biological and chemical agents.
[02:47:04.632 --> 02:47:08.174]  The troops were protected in those cases, said Dr. Michael Clipatrick.
[02:47:08.214 --> 02:47:09.215]  Yeah, I've had the victims on.
[02:47:09.615 --> 02:47:13.018]  Deputy Director of the Defense Department's Deployment Health Support Directorate.
[02:47:13.398 --> 02:47:22.386]  Senator Mike Thompson, Democrat, California, and several of his colleagues said it would be premature to close the book on investigations.
[02:47:22.546 --> 02:47:24.988]  So, see, it's a big whitewash, folks.
[02:47:25.208 --> 02:47:26.549]  But that's what they think of the troops.
[02:47:27.358 --> 02:47:40.829]  And the former top Army scientist who investigated depleted uranium claims in Iraq found that our troops have sores, lung cancer, and lung diseases, and thousands have died, tens of thousands are sick, and he's done blood tests.
[02:47:40.889 --> 02:47:42.571]  It's happening again to U.S.
[02:47:42.611 --> 02:47:46.374]  troops, British troops, and Australian troops.
[02:47:46.414 --> 02:47:47.214]  But that's okay.
[02:47:47.235 --> 02:47:48.936]  Support the troops by not caring about them.
[02:47:50.917 --> 02:47:53.058]  They got stuff about torturing Iraqis.
[02:47:53.078 --> 02:47:57.721]  They put them in rims for eight days with bags over their heads, handcuffed, tied down on their knees.
[02:47:57.741 --> 02:47:59.362]  One of the worst forms of torture.
[02:47:59.382 --> 02:48:00.963]  He tried for five minutes.
[02:48:01.923 --> 02:48:06.026]  Israel secretly arresting people and putting them in a secret camp, including U.S.
[02:48:06.046 --> 02:48:06.466]  citizens.
[02:48:06.506 --> 02:48:07.427]  The evidence is showing.
[02:48:07.447 --> 02:48:08.687]  That's Associated Press.
