[00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:07.258]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:15.363]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:17.104]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:19.025]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.406]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:22.047]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:26.370]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.993]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.422]  Another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:42.303]  It's... Well, it's dark outside.
[00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:44.464]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:46.545]  Nine o'clock Central Standard Time.
[00:00:47.726 --> 00:00:54.569]  On the... Well, we're already well into the month of August 2003.
[00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.149]  What is it?
[00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:56.430]  August... August 13, 2003.
[00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.671]  We've got a big...
[00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:10.321]  Show lined up for you this evening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:11.622 --> 00:01:14.704]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:14.764 --> 00:01:15.545]  And it's August 12, 2003.
[00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:18.547]  I tell you, that'll make you not trust electronics.
[00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:23.970]  I was looking at the atomic clock, and it flashed.
[00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:39.370]  The 13th, and then I looked back at it, and it said the 22nd.
[00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:49.114]  Then I looked down at this Bloomberg Financial News, and this must have been posted in Europe because it says August 13th, Bloomberg.
[00:01:49.134 --> 00:01:55.416]  And then I thought, you know, I think it's the 12th and not the 13th.
[00:01:55.956 --> 00:01:58.497]  You know, is this newspaper wrong?
[00:01:58.837 --> 00:02:00.417]  Is the atomic clock wrong?
[00:02:00.717 --> 00:02:01.478]  I knew it wasn't the 22nd.
[00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:09.265]  And then I remembered for sure that it is the 12th.
[00:02:09.325 --> 00:02:10.226]  Tomorrow is the 13th.
[00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:14.249]  It is Tuesday night, August 12, 2003.
[00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.771]  And for folks listening this Thursday when I'm going to be out of town,
[00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:31.305]  You will hear this is a rebroadcast on the daytime show, so for you it will be, I guess, the 14th.
[00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:31.885]  All right.
[00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:37.930]  That's a great way to spend the first two minutes of the show, babbling like an idiot.
[00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:43.555]  But we do have a big show lined up for you this evening, and we will have open phones.
[00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:45.836]  Here's one of the headlines.
[00:02:46.697 --> 00:02:51.521]  Australia's spy agency warns of biological chemical attacks.
[00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:55.955]  Says it's only a matter of time, not a question of if but when.
[00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:59.497]  We're going to be hit by chemicals and biologicals.
[00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:02.098]  Masses of us are going to die.
[00:03:02.158 --> 00:03:07.020]  They're going to have to run our lives and be our masters.
[00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:12.203]  So we'll be getting into this new horrific report.
[00:03:12.343 --> 00:03:19.206]  Also, the Postal Service is saying that, yeah, RFID, this microscopic program,
[00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:33.887]  Scannable, readable from a distance, microchips will be put on all the packaging and on letters, and you're going to have to buy this new special type of stamp, and, of course, the price is going to be passed on to you.
[00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:37.548]  Notice that Walmart and others tried to put this in.
[00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:39.309]  People rebelled and boycotted them.
[00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.951]  They went to the government and said, say it's for national security, make people accept it,
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:56.485]  And it turns out they've been meeting with Ridge months before it was rejected, saying they knew it would be rejected, and they said, quote, we need the government to neutralize opposition to this.
[00:03:56.585 --> 00:04:01.227]  So cashless society, slave grid, here we come.
[00:04:02.168 --> 00:04:05.610]  And so the government steps in and says, hey, folks, we're setting the precedent.
[00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.410]  You've got to have this to mail a letter.
[00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.871]  We've got to be able to track you.
[00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:14.634]  That's what the forefathers fought for, so everyone could be traceable and not have any rights.
[00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:18.369]  Also, no need for general U.S.
[00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:21.109]  smallpox shots, a top scientist says.
[00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.690]  This is from Reuters.
[00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.231]  A little bit late, though.
[00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:29.252]  I mean, they ordered the police and the firefighters and doctors to take it.
[00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:32.753]  99.9% plus said no.
[00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:38.534]  So now the government's going, okay, you don't have to take it.
[00:04:38.614 --> 00:04:43.115]  But they've got a plan, and so we'll go over that, too.
[00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:45.136]  And, yeah, people want to talk about it.
[00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.039]  So I'm prepared now.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.741]  And I've seen Arnold Schwarzenegger say this stuff, and I've read his own quotes out of his own book.
[00:04:54.742 --> 00:04:56.622]  So we'll talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:04:57.143 --> 00:05:04.305]  It's not really a diversion the way we're going to cover it, or a distraction.
[00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:05.725]  I'll explain when we get back.
[00:05:05.925 --> 00:05:07.486]  It's very serious.
[00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:07.906]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.665]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:14.845 --> 00:05:19.271]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:19.412 --> 00:05:23.838]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:25.179]  The New World Order.
[00:05:25.828 --> 00:05:27.349]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:41.937 --> 00:05:51.125]  Executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:51.325 --> 00:05:56.709]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.872]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:59.952 --> 00:06:00.513]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:06:00.973 --> 00:06:02.234]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:09.974 --> 00:06:10.294]  I think.
[00:06:10.314 --> 00:06:10.474]  I think.
[00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:38.855]  I think?
[00:07:08.615 --> 00:07:10.937]  And volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine
[00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:43.182]  Benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:49.827]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:54.430]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.853]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:03.296]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:08:03.336 --> 00:08:03.656]  That's AAA.
[00:08:06.698 --> 00:08:07.238]  My friends, it is my life.
[00:08:07.258 --> 00:08:11.261]  Studying the New World Order, researching history,
[00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:35.289]  I think?
[00:08:56.613 --> 00:09:05.736]  And sometimes it's hard to articulate it all to a population that's been bred and trained on sound bites and image.
[00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:10.017]  But we got a lot of serious news this evening.
[00:09:11.738 --> 00:09:19.180]  On the last show I did, I talked a lot about how they now have given us the official number.
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:25.542]  Three dozen Level 4 bioweapons labs with race...
[00:09:26.374 --> 00:09:35.580]  Specific viruses and bacteria being bred in them to kill certain races of people, weaponized smallpox, weaponized anthrax, weaponized Ebola.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.341]  This is just the stuff they tell us about.
[00:09:38.381 --> 00:09:40.743]  That stuff that's 30, 40 years old.
[00:09:43.364 --> 00:09:53.130]  The rumors coming out of Jane's Weapons Dictionary and Encyclopedia and other organizations is they got stuff that makes that look tame.
[00:09:55.109 --> 00:10:08.996]  But bottom line, it's a hundred times more dangerous than a giant nuclear power plant that was in the Ukraine that melted down called Chernobyl.
[00:10:09.836 --> 00:10:16.600]  I'd much rather have radiation than super weaponized race-specific bioweapons.
[00:10:19.001 --> 00:10:24.544]  Because when you've got a government on the left and the right run by eugenics promoters
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:39.792]  Run by a psychopathic racist, whether they're Nazis or Zionists or black Muslims, you've got a serious, serious problem, folks.
[00:10:43.315 --> 00:10:50.181]  And I look at the groups who are racially motivated in their little tribal units according to who has the power.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.321]  And things are very serious.
[00:10:57.261 --> 00:10:58.682]  Very, very serious.
[00:10:58.862 --> 00:11:02.123]  I mean, they got stuff, admittedly, that'll kill every human being on Earth.
[00:11:02.744 --> 00:11:20.631]  Two years ago, the Australian government published online the simple recipe to produce a form of mousepox that will kill every human it comes in contact with.
[00:11:22.262 --> 00:11:22.863]  Everyone.
[00:11:22.883 --> 00:11:22.863]  100%.
[00:11:23.563 --> 00:11:31.368]  Now, there's some arguments that there's always somebody, maybe one out of 10,000 who's immune, so some would live.
[00:11:31.388 --> 00:11:32.889]  But we're talking near to 100%.
[00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.491]  It'll kill any mammal.
[00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:37.032]  You just tailor it to that mammal.
[00:11:37.392 --> 00:11:38.212]  It wipes them out.
[00:11:38.653 --> 00:11:46.057]  They posted the genetic genome, the encoding, on the Internet on purpose.
[00:11:46.918 --> 00:11:51.361]  That way the globalists can release this type of stuff and say, oh, somebody got the recipe.
[00:11:52.068 --> 00:11:54.750]  You're going, well, that's quite a stretch, Mr. Jones.
[00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:56.691]  Well, no, it's not.
[00:11:56.891 --> 00:12:04.235]  In Road to Tyranny, I have the mainstream Australian newspapers with their official plan to exterminate half the world's population.
[00:12:04.595 --> 00:12:06.196]  That's declassified over there.
[00:12:06.996 --> 00:12:11.899]  I have State Department documents written by Henry Kissinger and commissioned by the NSA and others.
[00:12:13.619 --> 00:12:22.206]  Of programs with the CIA to forcibly sterilize half of the third world's women if they wanted IMF and World Bank money.
[00:12:24.407 --> 00:12:24.808]  That's from 1973.
[00:12:24.888 --> 00:12:41.220]  We've got them not just letting black men die of syphilis, now the evidence comes out, in some cases giving them syphilis, letting them spread it in their communities for 45 plus years.
[00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:50.637]  They estimate hundreds of thousands of cases of syphilis from the thousands of men they told they were getting treatment and didn't give it to them.
[00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:57.718]  The 400,000-plus women forcibly sterilized in this country, most of them not even mentally retarded.
[00:12:57.798 --> 00:13:02.419]  It's bad enough to do it to a mentally retarded person, much less someone who made under a B+.
[00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:03.699]  This is admitted.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:10.221]  They'd send CPS by to grab your daughter or son and peg them for medical students to cut their testicles off.
[00:13:10.828 --> 00:13:13.770]  That's what they did, or cut their uterus out.
[00:13:16.672 --> 00:13:18.714]  This is the New World Order.
[00:13:18.734 --> 00:13:20.075]  And let me tell you something.
[00:13:20.315 --> 00:13:32.044]  The filthy, dirty, wicked sickos like Margaret Sanger that the filthy, dirty Jesse Jacksons and Bill Clintons and Hillary Clintons won't talk about.
[00:13:32.584 --> 00:13:43.227]  The trash of the earth won't talk about Margaret Sanger, the liberal, who gave awards to Hitler, got awards from Hitler, traveled to see Hitler.
[00:13:43.487 --> 00:13:48.869]  They listed her in their eugenics plans of murdering people, mildly retarded people.
[00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.651]  It all started out with the sterilizations and the rest of it, and the left just loves it.
[00:13:55.731 --> 00:14:01.913]  Black Masons just love Albert Pike, founder of the Klan, Grand Supreme Mason.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.384]  They worship him at their little Masonic lodges.
[00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:09.306]  See, how whacked out is that?
[00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:10.187]  But it's all admitted.
[00:14:10.387 --> 00:14:19.416]  Margaret Sanger, a Nazi, all these inner-city black schools named after her, calling black people worthless and all these other terms.
[00:14:20.077 --> 00:14:20.898]  Horrible stuff.
[00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:23.220]  And I have to watch the left offend her.
[00:14:23.801 --> 00:14:25.503]  The same thing with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:14:26.542 --> 00:14:27.843]  I mean, I got Limbaugh here.
[00:14:27.923 --> 00:14:43.572]  I've got the text of what he said from his own website, for how good Arnold is, and so what if he's a liberal, and so what if he's anti-gun, and so what if he's open-border, and so what if he's pro-homosexuals adopting children, the other were grabbed by CPS, and so what?
[00:14:43.712 --> 00:14:45.072]  So what if he's for abortion?
[00:14:45.653 --> 00:14:47.634]  I've seen Sean Hannity on TV!
[00:14:48.034 --> 00:14:48.494]  Say it!
[00:14:48.534 --> 00:14:49.095]  Say good!
[00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:49.955]  So what?
[00:14:50.095 --> 00:14:50.736]  You've seen it.
[00:14:50.796 --> 00:14:51.436]  You've heard it.
[00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:53.832]  And, oh, the liberals are trying to stop it.
[00:14:54.032 --> 00:14:55.532]  They're bringing up his Nazi past.
[00:14:55.593 --> 00:14:56.453]  No, they're not.
[00:14:57.173 --> 00:14:59.654]  They're going, well, it is a concern, but he didn't mean it.
[00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:02.415]  And let's be honest about psychology.
[00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:04.676]  People love Nazis.
[00:15:05.997 --> 00:15:10.979]  Oh, they have the outward response of, ooh, how gross, if it's some mindless Klan member.
[00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:18.182]  But, oh, the movies, the police uniforms, the nomenclature, the culture, the way they promote it.
[00:15:19.156 --> 00:15:20.397]  People love Nazis.
[00:15:20.437 --> 00:15:26.641]  They love the formations and the uniforms and the Reich security, the land security.
[00:15:26.662 --> 00:15:30.684]  And so everybody's just fascinated with this.
[00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:34.287]  And, oh, well, Arnie didn't mean it.
[00:15:34.307 --> 00:15:39.631]  He gave $5 million to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:45.635]  He's been paying a large percentage of every film he's made to the Simon Wiesenthal Center and others.
[00:15:45.755 --> 00:15:47.977]  Well, yeah, you ever heard of the word payola?
[00:15:49.201 --> 00:15:50.061]  Protection money?
[00:15:50.081 --> 00:15:56.464]  I mean, he better hope it doesn't get out in the news, which it already has, that his daddy wasn't a police chief.
[00:15:57.224 --> 00:15:59.825]  Time Magazine just says he was a police chief.
[00:16:00.945 --> 00:16:06.587]  Yeah, during World War II, that was a high-level Nazi position in the Waffen-SS.
[00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:15.430]  The guy was involved in major persecution, was a wife-beater, beat up Arnold, loved the older brother who was the big one.
[00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.431]  That's why Arnold wanted to be the big, tough guy.
[00:16:18.732 --> 00:16:20.794]  Both products of an SS marriage.
[00:16:21.134 --> 00:16:22.535]  You go, don't blame Arnold.
[00:16:23.035 --> 00:16:25.537]  The guy vacations with Kirk Voltheim.
[00:16:26.077 --> 00:16:31.401]  And by the way, worse than being a Nazi, he was UN Secretary General for a decade.
[00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:44.370]  Then in the mid-80s ran, after he left the UN in 82 and became the President of Austria, and Arnold, after it came out that he was a Nazi, yeah, no kidding, his mommy lived with the head of their parliament,
[00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:59.361]  After Daddy died with another even higher-level Nazi that he called Uncle, some SS colonel, later the head of the parliament, Arnold calls him Uncle, Uncle.
[00:17:01.903 --> 00:17:09.849]  Arnold had such special treatment in the Army, he was allowed to go AWOL like George W. He grew up in a castle, folks.
[00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.452]  That's according to his own book, The Evolution of a Bodybuilder.
[00:17:16.415 --> 00:17:17.496]  So, this is so classic.
[00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:20.938]  Limbaugh comes out and goes, it's just terrible, it's just horrible.
[00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:31.826]  You know, Joseph Kennedy worked with the Nazis when he was ambassador to England, and he was all for Hitler, but notice the left doesn't attack him for that, doesn't attack him for that.
[00:17:32.266 --> 00:17:36.369]  Look at Arnold, this is absolutely, you know, he didn't do anything, it was just his dad.
[00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:37.710]  Well, the Kennedys have bigger connections.
[00:17:38.906 --> 00:17:41.127]  I've been pointing out for years Joseph Kennedy did all this.
[00:17:41.447 --> 00:17:43.088]  So did Prescott Bush, all of them.
[00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:47.590]  Prescott continued during the war with them as a double agent.
[00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:48.630]  This is all admitted.
[00:17:49.731 --> 00:17:54.973]  But Limbaugh, see, using half the paradigm, makes it, oh, see, the liberals, they're two-faced.
[00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.714]  But then I started saying, wait a minute.
[00:17:58.795 --> 00:18:01.076]  Yeah, the Kennedys were hooked in with the Nazis.
[00:18:02.056 --> 00:18:03.097]  Yeah, for profit.
[00:18:04.037 --> 00:18:07.158]  Yeah, and look at who's married into the Kennedys.
[00:18:07.538 --> 00:18:11.159]  Look at JFK's niece that Arnold is married to.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.602]  So it's this... But again, why don't you talk about Margaret Sanger Limbaugh, how she's a Nazi, how Planned Parenthood's a Nazi?
[00:18:20.882 --> 00:18:23.623]  Why don't you spend more time on that?
[00:18:23.723 --> 00:18:27.804]  Why do you defend the liberal, the socialist, the gun-grabber Arnold?
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:36.102]  See, there's no difference between Rush Limbaugh and Arnold Schwarzenegger and Al Gore and Bill Clinton and Maria Shriver.
[00:18:36.362 --> 00:18:37.443]  They're all elitist.
[00:18:38.123 --> 00:18:39.323]  It's all a big diversion.
[00:18:39.363 --> 00:18:42.464]  It's all a stupid joke, and it's a giant story.
[00:18:42.584 --> 00:18:43.404]  It is huge.
[00:18:43.544 --> 00:18:45.465]  It is a giant diversion.
[00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:50.787]  But by studying it, by looking at it, we can understand.
[00:18:50.807 --> 00:18:54.568]  Yeah, that's the whole point, Limbaugh.
[00:18:55.068 --> 00:18:58.509]  The Kennedys were hooked in with the Nazis, and Arnold's married in with them
[00:18:59.494 --> 00:19:00.695]  Yeah, that's the whole point.
[00:19:02.397 --> 00:19:03.178]  It goes on and on.
[00:19:03.218 --> 00:19:13.009]  But understand, folks, Arnold at his wedding in 1986 to Maria Shriver had the big gift from Kirk Valtime there.
[00:19:13.049 --> 00:19:19.396]  He'd just gotten back from Austria campaigning for Kirk Valtime after he'd been in the news that he was this top Nazi.
[00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:24.022]  And he says, well, I'll read his quote later.
[00:19:24.042 --> 00:19:26.723]  He goes, well, the whole Nazi thing really is no big deal.
[00:19:27.143 --> 00:19:28.883]  I love Erk Voltheim.
[00:19:29.123 --> 00:19:32.364]  He says, I love him, and Maria loves him too.
[00:19:32.764 --> 00:19:44.848]  All these seedy, fat Democrats, blue-blood, eastern, skull-and-bones establishment, John Kerry, all of them there, Republicans there, all in a dirty nest up there.
[00:19:46.016 --> 00:19:49.799]  Talking about how much they love the former Secretary General, the President of Austria.
[00:19:50.159 --> 00:19:57.484]  Oh, thank you for the bronze statue of Arnold Alos.
[00:19:57.684 --> 00:19:58.805]  Oh, that's Hitler's middle name.
[00:19:59.165 --> 00:19:59.926]  Schwarzenegger.
[00:20:04.309 --> 00:20:06.390]  But they're attacking Mel Gibson, though!
[00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.231]  Wait till you hear!
[00:20:10.373 --> 00:20:19.000]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:30.489]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:30.649 --> 00:20:33.351]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:33.712 --> 00:20:37.795]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:20:38.015 --> 00:20:40.156]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:40.296 --> 00:20:42.157]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:42.377 --> 00:20:48.399]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:54.302]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:21:12.792 --> 00:21:13.493]  Give it a try.
[00:21:13.693 --> 00:21:14.473]  Worked good for me.
[00:21:14.653 --> 00:21:18.015]  I'm going to have to go get re-measured because my pants are getting kind of baggy on me.
[00:21:18.175 --> 00:21:19.656]  My stomach is not there no more.
[00:21:19.716 --> 00:21:20.636]  It's really very easy.
[00:21:20.857 --> 00:21:23.418]  Helps me sleep good, lose weight, tones me up.
[00:21:23.718 --> 00:21:24.318]  Hey, I like it.

[00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.793]  The Freedom Calendar is available now at Midas Resources.
[00:24:02.813 --> 00:24:03.073]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:03.093 --> 00:24:04.895]  Get it now and start spreading the truth.
[00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:19.017]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:19.637 --> 00:24:22.639]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.881]  No, my friends.
[00:24:26.782 --> 00:24:27.542]  No, my friends.
[00:24:27.562 --> 00:24:40.070]  The truth is, Kirk Valtime, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Albert Pike, Margaret Sanger, Peter Singer, they all get
[00:24:41.084 --> 00:24:47.866]  A pat on the back by the establishment, because the establishment loves death, loves eugenics, loves evil.
[00:24:49.386 --> 00:24:52.427]  Now, look, I'm not sitting here attacking Arnold Schwarzenegger because I'm jealous of him.
[00:24:52.467 --> 00:24:54.648]  A lot of the liberals are.
[00:24:56.768 --> 00:25:08.872]  I'm attacking him because his book, Evolution of a Bodybuilder, he says that he doesn't believe in Christ, he doesn't like Jesus, he doesn't like Christians, he believes that he's a deity.
[00:25:10.771 --> 00:25:11.832]  This is something he wrote.
[00:25:11.872 --> 00:25:13.493]  It's got his name on it, folks.
[00:25:14.334 --> 00:25:16.575]  The guy is for unlimited abortion.
[00:25:17.076 --> 00:25:21.439]  He's for homosexuals adopting children, folks.
[00:25:21.479 --> 00:25:23.281]  He's for all of this.
[00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:25.442]  He's for massive gun control.
[00:25:26.183 --> 00:25:28.044]  And I was on a Christian conservative talk show today.
[00:25:28.124 --> 00:25:30.966]  Nice guys, and I said that, and they kind of, oh, well, yeah, we've read that.
[00:25:31.667 --> 00:25:33.028]  Well, no, Arnold has said it.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:41.966]  Folks, again, I talked about earlier today, I talked about how I, and I'm going to go to your calls in a few minutes, Gary and David and Kevin and others.
[00:25:41.986 --> 00:25:44.268]  If you want to join us on air, it's 800-259-9231.
[00:25:44.368 --> 00:25:50.053]  But this story ties into other things.
[00:25:50.093 --> 00:25:51.474]  That's why it actually makes sense.
[00:25:51.955 --> 00:25:52.395]  Talk about it.
[00:25:52.435 --> 00:25:53.216]  It's not a diversion.
[00:25:53.696 --> 00:25:54.977]  It shows the media hype.
[00:25:55.037 --> 00:25:57.179]  It shows how they manipulate people.
[00:25:57.239 --> 00:26:00.502]  It shows how they have a double standard for certain individuals.
[00:26:03.283 --> 00:26:10.389]  But I talked about how when I got out of high school, I'd been in sports, and I said, hey, I think I'll pick up lifting weights, not really bodybuilding.
[00:26:10.429 --> 00:26:12.291]  I just thought I'd lift weights a couple hours a day.
[00:26:12.951 --> 00:26:14.513]  And I got in pretty good shape.
[00:26:15.293 --> 00:26:18.116]  So I said, hey, I'll read these Arnold Schwarzenegger books.
[00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:20.838]  And I found out about him.
[00:26:20.878 --> 00:26:24.301]  I watched the video Pumping Iron where he says he likes Hitler.
[00:26:24.681 --> 00:26:27.283]  That's now been cut out of the versions that are out there, but it's in –
[00:26:29.574 --> 00:26:31.495]  It's in the MSNBC article.
[00:26:31.555 --> 00:26:34.336]  I mean, I've seen him say Hitler was a great guy, and he follows him.
[00:26:37.097 --> 00:26:40.618]  But again, he's at his wedding thanking Kirk Voltheim, but that's not all.
[00:26:41.219 --> 00:26:52.063]  There's photos of him just from last year at the Austrian Parliament with Kirk Voltheim and his mother when Daddy died 30 years ago.
[00:26:53.362 --> 00:27:02.621]  When he was like 27 years old, already in the U.S., when Daddy died, she moved in with an even higher level Nazi.
[00:27:02.641 --> 00:27:04.585]  The head of the parliament, folks!
[00:27:06.034 --> 00:27:15.260]  I mean, I remember reading stuff 15 years ago where Arnold wanted to be president and he was going to be governor and they got movies like Demolition Man where they make jokes about it.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.501]  You know, this is a 10-year-old movie.
[00:27:17.141 --> 00:27:20.584]  Or, oh, you know, we had President Schwarzenegger and, well, I didn't know they could do that.
[00:27:20.644 --> 00:27:22.145]  Well, they changed the law.
[00:27:22.185 --> 00:27:22.725]  Well, guess what?
[00:27:23.305 --> 00:27:27.608]  Oren, gun grabber, neocon hatch just introduced a law to do it.
[00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.352]  You see, Arnold's a member of Bohemian Grove, folks.
[00:27:34.173 --> 00:27:34.653]  Admittedly.
[00:27:35.481 --> 00:27:40.567]  And they said about a month ago in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Grove had told him to run.
[00:27:42.569 --> 00:27:44.311]  But they wanted Schwarzenegger.
[00:27:44.351 --> 00:27:46.814]  I said, looks like he's going to run then, folks.
[00:27:47.134 --> 00:27:48.997]  You know, I had the head of the recall campaign on.
[00:27:49.037 --> 00:27:50.318]  He said, oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:27:50.659 --> 00:27:51.640]  He's not going to run.
[00:27:54.392 --> 00:27:56.533]  Others said he had too many skeletons in the closet.
[00:27:56.593 --> 00:27:57.333]  It doesn't matter.
[00:27:57.393 --> 00:28:03.776]  You can be the son of a Nazi who promotes Hitler, who hangs out with Nazis, and says he loves them.
[00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:05.697]  I love Christ the full time.
[00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:10.699]  I mean, folks, a Nazi's bad, but the head of the UN, they've killed more people than the Nazis.
[00:28:10.899 --> 00:28:11.859]  That's even worse.
[00:28:15.501 --> 00:28:19.542]  Arnold is a very special individual, and he's not stupid either.
[00:28:21.403 --> 00:28:23.204]  And, you know, we've gotten Austrians...
[00:28:24.128 --> 00:28:29.572]  Before the sons of civil servants from a nearby town that end up being pretty powerful.
[00:28:31.614 --> 00:28:43.683]  And Arnold attends the Illuminati German encampment of the Grove, which MSNBC also admits that Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, was founded out of a German death cult of the Order of Skull and Bones.
[00:28:43.703 --> 00:28:45.044]  What do the Nazis wear on their hats?
[00:28:45.425 --> 00:28:46.105]  Skull and Bones.
[00:28:46.666 --> 00:28:47.967]  But all of this happens.
[00:28:47.987 --> 00:28:49.008]  This is why I'm so mad.
[00:28:49.108 --> 00:28:52.090]  And there are wall-to-wall articles demonizing Mel Gibson.
[00:28:54.022 --> 00:29:00.104]  Rabbis are calling him anti-Semitic, saying there's already repercussions, that he's evil, that it's bad, that the movie shouldn't be shown.
[00:29:02.025 --> 00:29:05.246]  Folks, the movie follows word for word the King James Bible.
[00:29:07.087 --> 00:29:08.707]  That stuff really happened to Christ.
[00:29:10.168 --> 00:29:11.628]  The rabbis really did kill him.
[00:29:13.089 --> 00:29:13.949]  Did have him killed.
[00:29:13.989 --> 00:29:15.249]  That's historical.
[00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.751]  But that's not acceptable, folks.
[00:29:19.331 --> 00:29:21.011]  That's not acceptable now.
[00:29:21.111 --> 00:29:22.692]  We've had Mel Gibson's father on and
[00:29:23.417 --> 00:29:24.978]  We know the Gibsons listen to the network.
[00:29:25.018 --> 00:29:26.379]  Pastor Butcher's show, my show.
[00:29:30.342 --> 00:29:31.363]  So think about that.
[00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:35.846]  You can be Margaret Sanger and butcher millions of black people and be for eugenics and the rest of it.
[00:29:36.707 --> 00:29:38.729]  And set up death mills in their neighborhoods.
[00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:39.329]  You're good.
[00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:40.670]  We'll name schools after you.
[00:29:41.571 --> 00:29:44.373]  You can be a guy who loves Nazis and basically is a Nazi.
[00:29:44.393 --> 00:29:46.394]  That's just fine because you're for gun control abortion.
[00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:50.317]  But you're a good Christian who makes a film about Christ.
[00:29:51.438 --> 00:29:52.459]  Word for word out of the Bible.
[00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.651]  And you're under attack.
[00:29:55.311 --> 00:29:57.512]  You see, Gibson hasn't paid them off.
[00:29:57.592 --> 00:29:58.312]  That's the problem.
[00:30:00.674 --> 00:30:01.594]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.074 --> 00:30:03.675]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.595 --> 00:30:07.277]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.131]  Are you losing your hair like me?
[00:30:12.151 --> 00:30:16.212]  Then you've got to listen to me about a great new product called New Hair.
[00:30:16.572 --> 00:30:21.974]  It's all natural, clinically tested to stop hair loss, and New Hair is guaranteed.
[00:30:21.994 --> 00:30:28.256]  264448 to learn more, or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[00:30:28.536 --> 00:30:30.936]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[00:30:40.903 --> 00:30:55.352]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[00:30:55.392 --> 00:30:56.112]  Thanks for joining me.
[00:30:56.152 --> 00:30:59.074]  I'm about to go to Gary and Chris and others that are patiently holding.
[00:30:59.114 --> 00:31:05.197]  If you'd like to join us on air on this live broadcast, this evening broadcast, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:31:10.603 --> 00:31:17.869]  Just in a nutshell, let me recap what I've been saying about Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger.
[00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:23.754]  The establishment is protecting him, both liberals and conservatives.
[00:31:25.115 --> 00:31:39.086]  He is anti-gun, anti-family, pro-abortion, pro-homosexual marriage and adoption of children that have been kidnapped by CPS, because that's where they come from in almost all cases.
[00:31:40.313 --> 00:31:49.400]  This is on the record, his own statements, and I talked about this today, and before I did this show tonight, I spent three hours today researching Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:55.124]  And much of the information I saw out there, I had already seen with my own eyes over the last decade.
[00:31:56.045 --> 00:32:00.168]  Because, again, years ago, when I had more time, I spent a lot of energy lifting weights.
[00:32:01.429 --> 00:32:03.951]  I enjoy doing it in the way it makes you feel.
[00:32:04.891 --> 00:32:08.074]  And so I'd read Arnold Schwarzenegger's own book,
[00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:16.708]  And where he talked about how he doesn't like Jesus and how he believes he is God and he doesn't like Christians and stuff like that.
[00:32:17.328 --> 00:32:21.649]  Please don't go buy it if you're going to go looking at the library for yourself.
[00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:33.372]  But overall, it's a big distraction, a big diversion because there's other people that have more Nazi ties than he did and nobody cares about them being in government.
[00:32:33.772 --> 00:32:36.353]  Margaret Sanger, the big liberal, the liberals just love her.
[00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:41.769]  Joseph Kennedy, Limbaugh pointed out that he's the big Nazi when he was ambassador to England.
[00:32:42.689 --> 00:32:45.630]  Well, yeah, Schwarzenegger's married into that family.
[00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:54.912]  And by the way, phony neocons who are out there supporting Schwarzenegger because he's pro-abortion, anti-gun, and all the rest of this going, well, the liberals don't like him.
[00:32:55.152 --> 00:32:58.393]  He is a liberal, and the liberals are leaving him alone, by the way.
[00:32:58.873 --> 00:33:01.674]  The articles you see are softballs, folks.
[00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:11.433]  Arnold had Kirk Voltheim and thanked him at the wedding in 86 and said, I love him, Maria loves him.
[00:33:11.733 --> 00:33:18.696]  The former Secretary General of the UN, the guy involved executing masses of Serbs, okay?
[00:33:18.916 --> 00:33:20.037]  He ran death camps.
[00:33:20.077 --> 00:33:21.217]  He was a top guy.
[00:33:21.237 --> 00:33:25.579]  Kirk Voltheim.
[00:33:26.716 --> 00:33:37.903]  And when Arnold's daddy died, who was the local Gestapo chief in their town, on the record, folks, he joined the Nazi party when it was illegal in Austria.
[00:33:39.023 --> 00:33:40.004]  He joined early.
[00:33:41.845 --> 00:33:42.826]  It is a sick joke.
[00:33:42.886 --> 00:33:48.149]  And Arnie's mommy ran off and married the head of the parliament, number two position in Deutschland.
[00:33:48.609 --> 00:33:49.990]  Arnie calls him his uncle.
[00:33:50.794 --> 00:33:53.596]  I mean, Arnie has been groomed by a bunch of old Nazis.
[00:33:53.937 --> 00:33:57.219]  And so, of course, he finds open arms in the Bush administration.
[00:33:57.459 --> 00:34:00.482]  And, of course, he finds open arms in the Kennedy sicko clan.
[00:34:03.084 --> 00:34:04.825]  He's a natural skull and boneser.
[00:34:04.945 --> 00:34:06.186]  They love him at the Grove.
[00:34:06.346 --> 00:34:13.351]  Helmut Schmidt, German chancellor, was going there and got Arnold in in the early 80s, folks, when he was unheard of.
[00:34:15.593 --> 00:34:15.993]  Why?
[00:34:16.013 --> 00:34:20.537]  The guy's a member of a Luciferian cult
[00:34:24.378 --> 00:34:26.480]  And frankly, this is a diversion and a destruction.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.582]  We just talk about Arnold and the governor's race because it doesn't matter.
[00:34:29.882 --> 00:34:41.130]  The governor doesn't run anything in that state, but it's the springboard for the presidency, and it shows us how far we've gone, that the media can just ignore the facts of what Arnold Schwarzenegger is.
[00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:46.174]  The guy in the movie Pumping Iron said he admired Adolf Hitler.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.742]  He admired men of power, that he wanted to control people.
[00:34:50.982 --> 00:34:54.624]  Folks, this guy's been caught on tape saying he wants to control people.
[00:34:56.405 --> 00:34:59.307]  Why would he turn down making all these big films he has lined up?
[00:34:59.607 --> 00:35:01.248]  King Conan and a bunch of others.
[00:35:01.708 --> 00:35:07.831]  Why would he turn down, you know, 60, 70, 80 million dollars the next three or four films he'll make when his thing's on the rebound?
[00:35:08.152 --> 00:35:10.093]  Because he wants power, folks.
[00:35:10.673 --> 00:35:14.135]  And, you know, we have a law against foreigners being president.
[00:35:14.904 --> 00:35:25.114]  Because you can have an Agent Uri type situation where foreign governments put agents here to get into government.
[00:35:26.535 --> 00:35:27.696]  And our country's lenient.
[00:35:27.716 --> 00:35:34.262]  In Germany or Russia or China or Mexico, you can't be elected unless you're from the country to a federal position.
[00:35:35.683 --> 00:35:38.526]  Here you can be anything but a vice president or president.
[00:35:40.914 --> 00:35:41.394]  And guess what?
[00:35:41.494 --> 00:35:53.577]  Orrin Hatch, the guy who wants to give more tuition to illegals than citizens, the guy who's anti-gun, oh, yeah, the Republican from Utah has introduced a bill just for Arnold so he can be president, folks.
[00:35:59.458 --> 00:36:02.219]  So that's all this thing is.
[00:36:02.839 --> 00:36:07.280]  And then on top of it, I'm going to say this, and I promise I'll go to all the calls.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.360]  I know we've got a lot of callers.
[00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:13.800]  California Rabbi says passion already fueling hatred.
[00:36:14.321 --> 00:36:22.383]  And on InfoWars.com, I got a link to the ADL demonizing Mel Gibson.
[00:36:22.843 --> 00:36:25.084]  And we've had Mel Gibson's father on several times.
[00:36:25.104 --> 00:36:26.264]  They're listeners to the network.
[00:36:29.325 --> 00:36:30.565]  I can't say any more than that.
[00:36:33.246 --> 00:36:36.967]  Well, anyways, the point is, this is ridiculous.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:40.266]  Here's Mel Gibson, Americans.
[00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:42.528]  His father served in World War II.
[00:36:42.568 --> 00:36:43.669]  Mel Gibson's a patriot.
[00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:45.050]  Got their Americans.
[00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.073]  Then they moved to Australia, and then they came back, folks.
[00:36:49.094 --> 00:36:51.796]  California rabbi says passion already fueling hatred.
[00:36:52.076 --> 00:36:53.217]  It's word for word.
[00:36:53.277 --> 00:36:59.103]  They took the King James, translated it back into Hebrew, Aramaic, and Latin.
[00:36:59.863 --> 00:37:00.664]  Word for word.
[00:37:01.044 --> 00:37:02.726]  The movie is all out of the Bible.
[00:37:02.766 --> 00:37:03.847]  Word for word, folks.
[00:37:04.187 --> 00:37:04.928]  Word for word.
[00:37:07.486 --> 00:37:11.788]  And they're saying it should be banned, it shouldn't be shown, it should be edited.
[00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.829]  Stop it.
[00:37:12.889 --> 00:37:13.549]  Don't show it.
[00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:15.310]  Folks, I've told you.
[00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.091]  They've got a law now in Pennsylvania.
[00:37:17.111 --> 00:37:21.013]  You can't read passages that condemn homosexuality in Pennsylvania.
[00:37:21.033 --> 00:37:23.834]  The Republican governor passed it, or you can be arrested.
[00:37:23.854 --> 00:37:25.195]  That was last year.
[00:37:26.076 --> 00:37:30.998]  BBC articles talk of banning passages that criticize any group in Old and New Testament.
[00:37:31.518 --> 00:37:32.419]  That was the headline.
[00:37:34.366 --> 00:37:35.467]  This is the new system.
[00:37:35.547 --> 00:37:47.532]  So you can be a Margaret Singer in love fest with Hitler, black men giving him syphilis, killing him, murdering people, running around sterilizing women, giving awards to Hitler.
[00:37:47.572 --> 00:37:57.556]  You're just fine thanking Kurt Voltheim, going on vacation with him, loving him like Schwarzenegger does, campaigning for him, not apologizing.
[00:37:59.077 --> 00:37:59.897]  And that's okay.
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.520]  Very interesting, though.
[00:38:02.081 --> 00:38:08.383]  Caller today said that Arnold Schwarzenegger got $5 million from the ADL, or Southern Poverty Law, excuse me, Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[00:38:08.403 --> 00:38:09.224]  He's given to all of it.
[00:38:10.564 --> 00:38:12.065]  I went and dug it up, the actual amounts.
[00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:13.346]  It's well over $5 million.
[00:38:13.586 --> 00:38:18.128]  He gives them a percentage of every film, a large percentage.
[00:38:21.289 --> 00:38:23.290]  And then they got him saying, oh, he's a good guy.
[00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:25.531]  Oh, no, his daddy's no big deal.
[00:38:26.291 --> 00:38:27.712]  Oh, they made his daddy join.
[00:38:29.029 --> 00:38:31.853]  Folks, his daddy joined when the party was illegal.
[00:38:32.454 --> 00:38:36.899]  Before they came in and shot the Austrian president and he died on the couch and all that.
[00:38:37.674 --> 00:38:39.015]  I think we're good to go.
[00:39:02.856 --> 00:39:07.919]  And I got the Simon Wiesenthal Center protecting this Nazi.
[00:39:07.959 --> 00:39:09.020]  Now, see, that shows it.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.861]  That shows exactly what we're dealing with here.
[00:39:11.921 --> 00:39:19.886]  You know, I was over at John Stettmiller's studio yesterday, and I finished the show up, and he said, you know, what is it about the New World War?
[00:39:19.926 --> 00:39:21.887]  They just love Nazis, and they do.
[00:39:22.227 --> 00:39:28.171]  They love the names, the outfits, the black ski mask, you know, the whole, they just love it.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:34.325]  Skull and bones, they eat off Hitler's silverware, got Nazi flags at the Grove, you know, all this stuff.
[00:39:34.606 --> 00:39:35.266]  It's all admitted.
[00:39:36.948 --> 00:39:39.310]  And then you've got all these Zionists involved with it.
[00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:43.474]  Well, the left wing's been writing articles, the real left wing, about how Zionists actually helped Hitler.
[00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:47.738]  Folks, when you get to the top of this, it is so sick.
[00:39:48.473 --> 00:39:51.695]  Well, it's like black masons with pictures of Albert Pike.
[00:39:51.735 --> 00:39:55.656]  They bow down to the founder of the Klan at the Black Masonic Halls.
[00:39:55.716 --> 00:40:10.003]  I mean, you know, it's all so warped and so turned upside down, the people are never going to figure it out that it's evil people, whether they're black or white or German or Jewish, that are running things, and we've got to learn to fight evil.
[00:40:10.443 --> 00:40:12.664]  So they're attacking Mel Gibson.
[00:40:15.808 --> 00:40:24.893]  Bill Gibson's new film, The Passion, has already unleashed a wave of anti-Semitism in the United States, despite the fact that it won't be released for months, a Jewish leader said on Tuesday.
[00:40:25.013 --> 00:40:25.653]  Oh, really?
[00:40:26.314 --> 00:40:35.519]  Rabbi Marvin Hare, founder of Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, the very group protecting the real Nazi...
[00:40:36.605 --> 00:40:37.166]  I will say it.
[00:40:37.186 --> 00:40:38.386]  Schwarzenegger is a Nazi.
[00:40:38.767 --> 00:40:39.047]  Okay?
[00:40:39.607 --> 00:40:53.558]  Rabbi Marvin Hare, founder of Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, told Reuters the Jewish Human Rights Organization has received dozens of hate calls and letters prompting by a handful of private screenings and advanced publicity about the movie.
[00:40:53.578 --> 00:40:53.998]  Yeah, right.
[00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:55.614]  We're good to go.
[00:41:14.941 --> 00:41:23.824]  They say if it was released in its current form, it could fuel the hatred, bigotry, and anti-Semitism that many responsible churches have worked hard to repudiate.
[00:41:24.224 --> 00:41:27.705]  It's called the Bible, written by Jews.
[00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.925]  Jesus Christ was a Jew.
[00:41:30.265 --> 00:41:32.046]  Are you saying he's anti-Semitic?
[00:41:32.706 --> 00:41:38.728]  Folks, this is the insanity of these people, of the government, of the Nazis, of the ADL, of all of them.
[00:41:39.989 --> 00:41:43.570]  You got Arnold saying, I won't apologize for Kirk Valtime.
[00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:44.390]  I love him.
[00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:45.550]  My wife loves him.
[00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:50.291]  We got photos of him last year with Valtime and little huggy kisses.
[00:41:51.511 --> 00:41:54.752]  His mommy is nesting with top Nazis.
[00:41:55.192 --> 00:41:59.553]  The guy says he loves and admires Hitler on pumping iron.
[00:42:01.053 --> 00:42:04.034]  We got Arnold Schwarzenegger saying he likes Hitler, folks.
[00:42:06.949 --> 00:42:10.031]  But he's good, the Simon Wiesenthal Center says!
[00:42:10.251 --> 00:42:11.391]  He's good!
[00:42:11.752 --> 00:42:14.413]  And you're an anti-Semite if you say he's bad!
[00:42:15.173 --> 00:42:17.134]  You're for guns, you're an anti-Semite!
[00:42:17.454 --> 00:42:19.576]  You're against abortion, you're an anti-Semite!
[00:42:19.936 --> 00:42:21.857]  But you're a real live Nazi!
[00:42:22.257 --> 00:42:23.498]  You're good!
[00:42:24.438 --> 00:42:33.383]  And you make a movie translated directly from the King James Bible, directly the exact story that's in the Bible, and that's anti-Semitic!
[00:42:33.663 --> 00:42:35.744]  Are you starting to get what this is all about, folks?
[00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:37.852]  These are a bunch of devils.
[00:42:38.252 --> 00:42:40.754]  They're not Germans, they're not Jews, they're devils.
[00:42:41.314 --> 00:42:44.576]  And they want to restrict the First Amendment, and it is a shame.
[00:42:45.857 --> 00:42:48.538]  We are now anti-Semitic for standing up against Nazis.
[00:42:49.179 --> 00:42:49.979]  Understand it.
[00:42:50.699 --> 00:42:52.380]  That's what I've been saying for years, folks.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.562]  Let's talk to Greg in Idaho.
[00:42:55.582 --> 00:42:57.203]  Sorry for having you hold so long, Greg.
[00:42:57.483 --> 00:42:57.944]  Go ahead.
[00:42:58.104 --> 00:42:58.784]  Oh, this is Gary.
[00:42:59.184 --> 00:43:01.166]  Hey, Alex, thanks a lot for your good work and everything.
[00:43:01.186 --> 00:43:03.407]  My wife and I's prayers are for you and your family, but...
[00:43:03.832 --> 00:43:04.653]  I got a question.
[00:43:05.153 --> 00:43:13.119]  Was Julius Caesar the first Caesar, and was he the first one really to become the dictator of the Roman Republic?
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.941]  He crossed the Rubicon.
[00:43:14.981 --> 00:43:17.703]  He brought his Praetorian Guard into Rome.
[00:43:18.003 --> 00:43:19.845]  He put troops on the streets.
[00:43:20.645 --> 00:43:21.046]  Okay.
[00:43:21.386 --> 00:43:22.727]  I got a little quote from him.
[00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:24.088]  It's only two sentences or so.
[00:43:24.148 --> 00:43:25.129]  Would you like to hear it?
[00:43:25.489 --> 00:43:25.809]  Sure.
[00:43:25.889 --> 00:43:26.470]  This is great.
[00:43:27.816 --> 00:43:35.819]  Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip up the citizenry into a patriotic fever.
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:39.601]  For patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword.
[00:43:40.181 --> 00:43:43.763]  It emboldens the blood just as it narrows the mind.
[00:43:44.383 --> 00:43:56.128]  And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind is closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry.
[00:43:56.693 --> 00:44:06.495]  Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all their rights unto the leaders, and gladly so.
[00:44:07.795 --> 00:44:08.855]  How do I know?
[00:44:08.915 --> 00:44:16.416]  Sir, they say that quote is not authentic, though Caesar, on the record, did say some of what's in that quote.
[00:44:16.996 --> 00:44:18.417]  Okay, I stand corrected.
[00:44:18.577 --> 00:44:20.437]  Well, no, we don't know what the truth is.
[00:44:20.517 --> 00:44:21.997]  We know he did say some of that.
[00:44:22.517 --> 00:44:24.318]  The whole quote is not authentic.
[00:44:24.478 --> 00:44:24.998]  They say.
[00:44:25.038 --> 00:44:25.558]  We don't know.
[00:44:25.958 --> 00:44:26.358]  Okay.
[00:44:27.959 --> 00:44:29.060]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:29.900]  It's still the truth.
[00:44:30.341 --> 00:44:32.782]  Yeah.
[00:44:33.102 --> 00:44:46.150]  And by the way, as far as Arnold goes and the boys, it's interesting that back in the time when the Jewish apostles wrote the New Testament under the inspiration of the Lord Jesus Christ, they were forbidden not to speak his name.
[00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:49.533]  And it kind of reminds me of then and it is now, you know?
[00:44:50.413 --> 00:44:51.234]  Well, that's it.
[00:44:51.294 --> 00:44:56.397]  But, I mean, do you see the insane hypocrisy of Arnold, a real live Nazi?
[00:44:56.437 --> 00:44:56.697]  Yeah.
[00:44:57.452 --> 00:44:57.692]  Yeah.
[00:44:57.772 --> 00:45:00.993]  An old Chinese proverb goes, may you live in interesting times.
[00:45:01.513 --> 00:45:02.553]  It is interesting.
[00:45:27.597 --> 00:45:30.198]  Well, it goes back to the fact that it's all about power.
[00:45:31.079 --> 00:45:35.321]  Arnold Schwarzenegger's a New World Order whore, and Mel Gibson isn't.
[00:45:38.423 --> 00:45:39.824]  Mel Gibson's an American.
[00:45:39.844 --> 00:45:41.185]  He's not an Australian, folks.
[00:45:41.845 --> 00:45:43.046]  He was born in New York.
[00:45:43.826 --> 00:45:45.047]  He's an American.
[00:45:46.167 --> 00:45:47.668]  He fights the New World Order.
[00:45:47.748 --> 00:45:49.269]  He knows about the New World Order.
[00:45:49.329 --> 00:45:51.110]  His father knows about the New World Order.
[00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:52.451]  We've had him on the show.
[00:45:53.146 --> 00:45:53.246]  Yeah.
[00:45:53.266 --> 00:45:53.346]  Yeah.
[00:46:21.065 --> 00:46:22.245]  Does that give you an idea?
[00:46:22.565 --> 00:46:23.966]  We're being persecuted.
[00:46:24.566 --> 00:46:31.547]  They want to carry out Nazi programs against Christians, and if we raise a finger to defend our families, we're Nazis.
[00:46:31.887 --> 00:46:32.187]  No!
[00:46:32.727 --> 00:46:34.528]  They are defenders of Nazis.
[00:46:34.568 --> 00:46:35.948]  We have them caught doing it.
[00:46:37.688 --> 00:46:49.411]  What was that quote that Carol Quigley said that I care not whether it be, paraphrasing, whether it be liberal or Republican who gets elected, it doesn't matter who does, it
[00:46:50.399 --> 00:46:53.561]  Yeah, it's the means.
[00:46:53.701 --> 00:46:54.161]  It's ill.
[00:46:54.421 --> 00:46:59.244]  The means and the timing will differ, but the outcome will always be the same.
[00:46:59.384 --> 00:46:59.965]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:47:00.085 --> 00:47:00.725]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:00.845 --> 00:47:01.225]  Okay, thanks.
[00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:05.748]  Well, I mean, we got all these so-called conservatives defending Arnold going, oh, he's a good guy.
[00:47:05.768 --> 00:47:06.509]  Yeah, he's liberal.
[00:47:06.529 --> 00:47:07.049]  So what?
[00:47:07.209 --> 00:47:07.849]  Abortion.
[00:47:07.889 --> 00:47:09.530]  Yeah, grabbing your guns.
[00:47:09.851 --> 00:47:11.812]  Yeah, you know, homosexuals adopting.
[00:47:11.852 --> 00:47:12.712]  Yeah, that's all right.
[00:47:13.253 --> 00:47:14.673]  These liberals are trying to get him.
[00:47:14.713 --> 00:47:15.514]  We got to stop him.
[00:47:15.814 --> 00:47:17.615]  These liberals are trying to get him.
[00:47:17.655 --> 00:47:18.776]  He's married to the Kennedys.
[00:47:21.644 --> 00:47:23.506]  All right, let's talk to who's up next.
[00:47:26.048 --> 00:47:27.290]  Chris Kentucky, go ahead.
[00:47:30.132 --> 00:47:31.614]  Okay, well, that's a good call.
[00:47:33.175 --> 00:47:34.917]  We'll talk to him for a while then.
[00:47:35.457 --> 00:47:36.158]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:47:37.219 --> 00:47:38.100]  I can hear you breathing.
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:38.661]  All right.
[00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:40.162]  Well, you know what we're going to do?
[00:47:40.943 --> 00:47:42.144]  We're going to go to break.
[00:47:42.544 --> 00:47:43.065]  We'll come back.
[00:47:43.105 --> 00:47:44.466]  We'll see if the callers want to talk.
[00:47:45.687 --> 00:47:45.808]  And...
[00:47:46.986 --> 00:47:49.266]  Toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:47:49.286 --> 00:48:07.710]  I'm going to call the Simon Wiesenthal Center up, and I'm going to demand, I'm going to say, you need to come on this show and explain why you protect Arnold Schwarzenegger, but you go after somebody like Mel Gibson who's done nothing to you.
[00:48:08.971 --> 00:48:10.771]  Why are you persecuting Mel Gibson?
[00:48:11.251 --> 00:48:15.812]  Mel Gibson put $25 million into this film of his own money.
[00:48:16.966 --> 00:48:18.187]  Most of his money, folks.
[00:48:19.188 --> 00:48:21.009]  And all it does is go right out of the Bible.
[00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:23.071]  But that's not acceptable in America.
[00:48:23.391 --> 00:48:30.257]  But some dirty, Christ-hating Nazi, they just love him!
[00:48:31.478 --> 00:48:33.439]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:48:33.539 --> 00:48:34.200]  Hello, folks.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:44.228]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 fluoride and arsenic reduction elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:48:44.608 --> 00:48:49.135]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the black Berkey purification element.
[00:48:49.195 --> 00:49:00.531]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:49:00.831 --> 00:49:01.592]  We're good to go.
[00:49:32.392 --> 00:49:35.333]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:49:35.993 --> 00:49:37.273]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:49:37.473 --> 00:49:43.215]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:49:43.496 --> 00:49:48.757]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:49:49.037 --> 00:49:53.159]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination has blown wide open.
[00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:57.144]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:49:57.404 --> 00:50:02.050]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:08.398]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:10.261]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:12.823]  Order 911 The Road to Terry today.
[00:50:12.903 --> 00:50:17.167]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:50:26.795 --> 00:50:28.297]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:50:28.477 --> 00:50:30.519]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:50:31.218 --> 00:50:34.279]  Heart disease continues to be a leading cause of death in America.
[00:50:34.699 --> 00:50:34.979]  Why?
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.180]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?
[00:50:38.381 --> 00:50:43.062]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[00:50:43.362 --> 00:50:53.166]  The all-natural ingredients in Cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities and improving oxygen and blood flow in your heart.
[00:50:53.386 --> 00:50:58.448]  And right now, as a special offer to GCN listeners, you'll get a four-month supply for only $99 plus shipping.
[00:50:59.588 --> 00:51:00.129]  We're good to go.
[00:51:22.688 --> 00:51:23.628]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:23.649 --> 00:51:25.129]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:44.717 --> 00:51:45.498]  We're back live.
[00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:50.123]  Got a bunch of news about the government saying brace for massive chemical and biological attack.
[00:51:50.163 --> 00:51:51.344]  More hijacked jets.
[00:51:51.645 --> 00:51:54.067]  Give all your rights up and they'll take good care of you.
[00:51:54.087 --> 00:51:56.169]  That's what a terrorist says.
[00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.052]  Bad things are going to happen if you don't let me run your life.
[00:51:59.072 --> 00:51:59.513]  Hmm.
[00:52:00.033 --> 00:52:01.575]  Hidden in plain view what's happening.
[00:52:02.433 --> 00:52:05.314]  A bunch of other news, and I know we've got loaded phones here.
[00:52:05.434 --> 00:52:08.254]  Chris and Keith and Ron and Richard and Spencer.
[00:52:08.274 --> 00:52:10.575]  We're going to get to all of you just briefly.
[00:52:11.275 --> 00:52:14.095]  I've made nine documentary films, full-length features.
[00:52:14.515 --> 00:52:18.176]  The newest film is Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:52:18.196 --> 00:52:20.557]  It's two hours and 40 minutes long.
[00:52:20.617 --> 00:52:31.879]  It covers Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, dozens of examples of government-sponsored terrorism, government-run white slavery rings, forced inoculation, gun control,
[00:52:32.938 --> 00:52:33.858]  We're good to go.
[00:52:52.646 --> 00:52:53.406]  You need to get that.
[00:52:53.927 --> 00:53:02.950]  We've now released Paul Joseph Watson's new book, 334 pages long, Order Out of Chaos, Elite-Sponsored Terrorism in the New World Order.
[00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:03.331]  It's only $19.95.
[00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:09.773]  Folks, just go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:53:09.793 --> 00:53:11.694]  You need these films.
[00:53:11.714 --> 00:53:14.075]  You need to get them.
[00:53:14.195 --> 00:53:16.116]  You need to show them to people.
[00:53:16.456 --> 00:53:17.677]  You need to wake America up.
[00:53:21.919 --> 00:53:35.067]  888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:53:36.168 --> 00:53:37.408]  The videos are $25.95 apiece.
[00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:38.609]  Order three or more.
[00:53:38.649 --> 00:53:39.270]  They drop down to $20.
[00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:43.212]  My book, Descent into Tyranny, about September 11th, is $12.
[00:53:44.093 --> 00:53:46.954]  And again, the new book, Order Out of Chaos, is only $19.95.
[00:53:48.055 --> 00:53:50.656]  Take action, and your purchase supports this show, what we do.
[00:53:51.177 --> 00:53:52.297]  Let's go to Chris in Kentucky.
[00:53:52.317 --> 00:53:53.298]  Chris, now we've got you.
[00:53:53.338 --> 00:53:53.718]  Go ahead.
[00:53:54.158 --> 00:53:55.239]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:53:55.679 --> 00:54:01.982]  I was really very amazed that Kirk Fulltime was with the Schwarzenegger Party.
[00:54:02.382 --> 00:54:03.463]  You mentioned your films.
[00:54:04.003 --> 00:54:07.445]  Those fairly new listeners out there, if you want to know about the U.N.
[00:54:07.505 --> 00:54:08.165]  and all of that stuff,
[00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:11.546]  Yeah, I was exposing him back in the, well, in that film in 97.
[00:54:19.355 --> 00:54:19.635]  Incredible.
[00:54:19.675 --> 00:54:20.075]  Incredible.
[00:54:48.067 --> 00:54:49.648]  I've got the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[00:54:49.868 --> 00:54:52.609]  I've got them just drooling over Arnold.
[00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:55.791]  But Mel Gibson is bad.
[00:54:56.671 --> 00:54:58.132]  Yeah, and that's the truth.
[00:54:58.252 --> 00:54:59.533]  Mel Gibson is bad.
[00:54:59.793 --> 00:55:00.793]  Christians are bad.
[00:55:00.813 --> 00:55:05.195]  It's okay to have people that are... Yeah, they're the bigots.
[00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:06.436]  It's not about Nazis.
[00:55:06.476 --> 00:55:08.557]  It's a big, dirty business.
[00:55:09.097 --> 00:55:12.439]  The whole Holocaust thing is a big, dirty business.
[00:55:12.779 --> 00:55:16.361]  It's about making everybody guilty to go along with the New World Order's agenda...
[00:55:17.248 --> 00:55:22.812]  And basically, the Wiesenthal Center and the ADL rent out the cause.
[00:55:23.132 --> 00:55:25.334]  They rent out the cause to anybody.
[00:55:25.654 --> 00:55:27.636]  There's no morals, nothing to do with it.
[00:55:27.856 --> 00:55:29.317]  It's about renting out the cause.
[00:55:29.537 --> 00:55:35.601]  Well, I stand against the Nazi Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I stand against those that support the Nazis.
[00:55:36.042 --> 00:55:40.025]  And that includes the CIA when there was former Gestapo agents that worked with the CIA as well.
[00:55:40.045 --> 00:55:41.366]  Klaus Barbie, all of them.
[00:55:41.386 --> 00:55:45.989]  They helped build the rockets, the drug dealing, the CIA torture schools at Fort Benning.
[00:55:46.815 --> 00:55:48.436]  We are totally controlled by this.
[00:55:48.757 --> 00:55:49.637]  It's total control.
[00:55:50.298 --> 00:55:50.978]  Total control.
[00:55:51.639 --> 00:55:52.760]  That's just for your safety.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:53.380]  All this.
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.662]  Oh, hey, I'm a Nazi because I'm against Nazis, folks.
[00:55:58.604 --> 00:55:59.405]  Thanks a lot, Chris.
[00:55:59.445 --> 00:56:00.265]  Really great points.
[00:56:01.686 --> 00:56:08.832]  Folks, we have now text of those that have screened the Passion by Gibson.
[00:56:09.973 --> 00:56:11.654]  It's word for word the Bible.
[00:56:12.819 --> 00:56:14.160]  They want it banned.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.721]  But a Nazi's okay.
[00:56:16.781 --> 00:56:18.001]  Oh, we love him.
[00:56:18.261 --> 00:56:18.922]  Be right back.
[00:56:21.743 --> 00:56:25.024]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation.
[00:56:25.265 --> 00:56:27.926]  But during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:56:28.626 --> 00:56:39.811]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.875 --> 00:56:48.536]  Big Brother.
[00:56:49.196 --> 00:56:50.237]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.958 --> 00:56:52.079]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.719 --> 00:56:53.540]  You want answers?
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.181]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.201 --> 00:56:59.464]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:00.065 --> 00:57:04.168]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:07.991]  I tell you folks, it's absolutely amazing.
[00:57:08.031 --> 00:57:11.374]  Just recapping for those stations that just joined us, quite a few of them.
[00:57:11.814 --> 00:57:15.457]  We'll go to Keith and Ron and Kenneth, Ron, Richard.
[00:57:17.121 --> 00:57:18.422]  Spencer, John, and others.
[00:57:19.623 --> 00:57:26.769]  The ADL, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, they are attacking mercilessly Mel Gibson's new film, The Passion.
[00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:32.033]  I know the Mel Gibson family are listeners to this network, to Pastor Butch's show, to my show.
[00:57:32.374 --> 00:57:34.175]  Now we've got Hutton Gibson and others on.
[00:57:35.676 --> 00:57:40.180]  We've read the reviews of those that have seen advanced screenings of The Passion.
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:43.603]  It is word for word out of the King James Version.
[00:57:45.129 --> 00:57:51.554]  That is where they took the exact words of that, translated it back into Latin, back into Hebrew.
[00:57:52.555 --> 00:57:53.976]  Jesus Christ was a Jew.
[00:57:53.996 --> 00:57:56.618]  So were most of his disciples.
[00:57:56.818 --> 00:58:02.162]  And they're saying it's racist, it should be canceled, it should be altered, it should be edited, it should not be shown.
[00:58:02.423 --> 00:58:07.506]  There's moves in Europe to ban the film, ban the Old Testament, New Testament.
[00:58:08.787 --> 00:58:11.810]  All of it, folks, because Christ showed up to the Pharisees.
[00:58:13.686 --> 00:58:19.172]  It'd be like if I stood up against Robert Tilton for being corrupt, they'd say, you're against white people, or you're against Christians.
[00:58:19.232 --> 00:58:21.114]  No, we're against corrupt people, period.
[00:58:21.415 --> 00:58:23.637]  Whether they're German or Jewish or Easter bunnies.
[00:58:24.498 --> 00:58:34.109]  But now, the incredible part of this that's got me so mad is they're calling this film evil and saying it should be restricted or banned.
[00:58:35.439 --> 00:58:38.342]  But they are praising Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:58:38.382 --> 00:58:50.714]  The very Simon Wiesenthal Center is saying Arnold isn't a Nazi and is good when Arnold is on video saying, I admire Hitler in Pumping Iron, which now the newer versions don't have, but that's here in MSNBC.
[00:58:51.475 --> 00:58:52.416]  He admires Hitler.
[00:58:52.816 --> 00:58:54.157]  He supports Kurt Waldheim.
[00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:57.741]  After it came out, he was a top Nazi involved in war crimes against Serbs.
[00:58:59.361 --> 00:58:59.982]  He's come out.
[00:59:00.362 --> 00:59:01.863]  He supports Kurt of all time.
[00:59:02.144 --> 00:59:03.185]  He's with him all the time.
[00:59:03.205 --> 00:59:06.187]  We got a photo of him a year ago in Austria with him.
[00:59:06.488 --> 00:59:12.053]  His mother, after his dad died, who was a Gestapo officer, moved in with the head of the parliament who was a former top Nazi.
[00:59:12.593 --> 00:59:13.674]  He's saying he loves him.
[00:59:13.714 --> 00:59:14.435]  He loves Hitler.
[00:59:15.136 --> 00:59:16.677]  They like Arnold.
[00:59:16.717 --> 00:59:18.739]  They say he's a model person.
[00:59:20.055 --> 00:59:25.499]  So, they attack Steve Voss for his not a word about race, for his Christian music.
[00:59:25.839 --> 00:59:30.843]  They attack a great American, and by the way, born in New York, Mel Gibson.
[00:59:31.664 --> 00:59:37.248]  They attack him when there's not a shred of truth, but then they love a real Nazi.
[00:59:37.288 --> 00:59:38.589]  Now, that's sick, folks.
[00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:41.451]  Kenneth in South Carolina, go ahead.
[00:59:42.111 --> 00:59:42.872]  Good night, Alex.
[00:59:44.413 --> 00:59:46.174]  You know, there are others on the ballot.
[00:59:46.575 --> 00:59:47.235]  It's amusing.
[00:59:47.275 --> 00:59:48.116]  There's Larry Flint.
[00:59:49.255 --> 00:59:50.896]  And he's worth $400 million.
[00:59:50.936 --> 00:59:52.077]  Did you know that?
[00:59:53.038 --> 00:59:53.278]  Yes.
[00:59:53.298 --> 01:00:00.423]  I mean, Flint, I was surprised that he had amassed that much money from his, you know, disgusting operations.
[01:00:01.404 --> 01:00:04.526]  But, you know... He owns a bunch of porno labels.
[01:00:04.586 --> 01:00:05.046]  Big money.
[01:00:05.266 --> 01:00:05.887]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:00:05.907 --> 01:00:07.648]  I didn't know there was that much money in that.
[01:00:08.429 --> 01:00:10.930]  Because his magazine... Well, ask Arnold how much money there is in it.
[01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:11.671]  I don't know.
[01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:16.114]  His Hustler magazine only has a circulation of about a half a million.
[01:00:16.134 --> 01:00:16.214]  Yeah.
[01:00:17.108 --> 01:00:18.349]  It's not that big.
[01:00:18.409 --> 01:00:19.549]  The money's in the porn.
[01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:23.051]  Penthouse, Guccione, he just filed for bankruptcy.
[01:00:24.131 --> 01:00:25.052]  Today, I believe.
[01:00:26.132 --> 01:00:26.993]  Penthouse Magazine.
[01:00:27.013 --> 01:00:27.753]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:00:28.474 --> 01:00:29.434]  That's about finished.
[01:00:30.094 --> 01:00:33.196]  I tell you, I'd rather have actor Gary Coleman in there than Arnold.
[01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:37.598]  Well, I mean, do you understand my outrage at the Simon Wiesenthal Center?
[01:00:37.878 --> 01:00:38.979]  I mean, I've got the quotes.
[01:00:39.399 --> 01:00:42.180]  Worshipping Arnold and then demonizing Mel Gibson.
[01:00:42.801 --> 01:00:44.221]  I understand what you're saying, but...
[01:00:46.624 --> 01:00:48.965]  You know, maybe I heard you.
[01:00:48.985 --> 01:00:50.745]  You chopped Ann Coulter up pretty good.
[01:00:50.765 --> 01:00:53.566]  I mean, that was amazing.
[01:00:53.606 --> 01:00:56.687]  You really did a job on her, and she deserved it.
[01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:03.388]  And, you know, that's one of the best interviews I've ever heard, the best interview on your program.
[01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:09.630]  Well, we're trying to get neocons on, but suddenly my name has gone out as this evil creature.
[01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:13.071]  I was amazed that she stayed on there with you as long as she did.
[01:01:16.007 --> 01:01:17.288]  She's an amazing creature.
[01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:23.738]  She admitted that she hadn't read the Patriot Act but she's written a book about how, quote, the liberals are liars about it.
[01:01:23.778 --> 01:01:27.163]  Well, you went easy on her and then you chopped her up pretty good down there near the end.
[01:01:29.193 --> 01:01:30.333]  I don't know how good a job I did.
[01:01:30.493 --> 01:01:31.414]  You did a very good job.
[01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:33.134]  I had to have a vomit bucket.
[01:01:33.414 --> 01:01:34.894]  Are you done, Kenneth, or do you want to add more?
[01:01:35.074 --> 01:01:36.055]  Well, you did a good job.
[01:01:36.415 --> 01:01:36.695]  Stay there.
[01:01:36.715 --> 01:01:37.435]  I'll let you finish up.
[01:01:37.775 --> 01:01:40.716]  Then we'll go to Ron and Richard and Spencer and John.
[01:01:40.736 --> 01:01:41.336]  Everybody stay there.
[01:01:41.356 --> 01:01:42.336]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:42.876 --> 01:01:47.237]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:01:47.417 --> 01:01:51.818]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:56.340]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.720]  The New World Order.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.741]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:10.743]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:02:10.863 --> 01:02:12.923]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:02:13.243 --> 01:02:23.665]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:02:23.886 --> 01:02:25.786]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[01:02:26.206 --> 01:02:29.290]  Then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:02:29.751 --> 01:02:32.415]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:33.156]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:02:33.176 --> 01:02:33.516]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:02:33.536 --> 01:02:34.798]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:02:42.188 --> 01:02:43.809]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:02:44.149 --> 01:02:49.913]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:02:50.153 --> 01:02:55.297]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:02:55.637 --> 01:03:04.943]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:03:05.284 --> 01:03:10.207]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:03:10.467 --> 01:03:10.987]  We're good to go.
[01:03:39.409 --> 01:03:40.550]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:03:42.172 --> 01:03:46.477]  Every cell of the body has a receptor site for our master hormone called growth hormone.
[01:03:46.877 --> 01:03:49.961]  The role of growth hormone is to instruct the cells to repair.
[01:03:50.361 --> 01:03:55.387]  This hormone is in the highest concentrations in the body between the ages of infancy and your early twenties.
[01:03:55.787 --> 01:03:59.211]  Hence, this is the major reason why the body repairs so well when young.
[01:03:59.771 --> 01:04:00.552]  We're good to go.
[01:04:18.328 --> 01:04:28.113]  Deep sleep, improved mood, memory and energy, losses of body fat, improved strength and sex drive, reduction of joint pains, improved blood sugar, and more.
[01:04:28.373 --> 01:04:30.394]  Improve your chemistry and improve your life.
[01:04:30.594 --> 01:04:31.935]  Satisfaction guaranteed.
[01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:32.295]  Call 800-814-5031.
[01:04:32.315 --> 01:04:32.355]  800-814-5031.
[01:04:32.375 --> 01:04:32.415]  800-814-5031.
[01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:48.608]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:57.511]  A lot of people are talking about this galactic-sized destruction that is Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:04:58.811 --> 01:05:00.232]  Just a correction.
[01:05:01.672 --> 01:05:06.433]  On the show where I was mentioning him, I said Arnold Schwarzenegger stands for blackhead.
[01:05:06.453 --> 01:05:08.074]  Well, that's Schwarzkopf.
[01:05:08.923 --> 01:05:16.106]  Arnold Schwarzenegger means black plowman or lower caste farm worker.
[01:05:16.966 --> 01:05:28.631]  Just interesting piece of historical tidbit about the caste society in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire and before that and how we all, I guess, get these names today.
[01:05:29.351 --> 01:05:33.653]  But the reason I'm talking about him is because the guy is definitely a Nazi.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:38.082]  He says he loves Hitler, that he admires Adolf Hitler.
[01:05:38.142 --> 01:05:42.904]  He said it on national TV, folks, in 1976 in Pumping Iron.
[01:05:42.924 --> 01:05:43.805]  That aired on TV.
[01:05:45.386 --> 01:05:47.667]  He said he admired Hitler.
[01:05:47.807 --> 01:06:00.733]  In 1986, thanked Kurt Waldheim in front of a church full of Kennedys and everybody else in the middle of Waldheim being in a big scandal for being a mass murderer, a war criminal, who was also head of the U.N., by the way, U.N.
[01:06:00.753 --> 01:06:01.654]  Secretary General.
[01:06:03.325 --> 01:06:04.326]  And he campaigns for him.
[01:06:04.526 --> 01:06:05.487]  He hangs out with him today.
[01:06:05.507 --> 01:06:09.189]  I've got a photo of him on the site right now with Kirk Voltheim just last year.
[01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:11.571]  Kirk Voltheim.
[01:06:12.311 --> 01:06:17.235]  And Arnold's daddy was not a police chief, but a Nazi police chief.
[01:06:17.315 --> 01:06:20.457]  I love Time Magazine's got him compared to Ronald Reagan.
[01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:22.671]  It's like how great Arnold is.
[01:06:22.691 --> 01:06:23.671]  This is great spread.
[01:06:23.711 --> 01:06:26.212]  He's a wonderful, decent, loving person.
[01:06:26.593 --> 01:06:31.755]  Oh, look, Reagan's daddy was a shoe salesman.
[01:06:31.895 --> 01:06:33.376]  Arnold was a police chief.
[01:06:34.316 --> 01:06:40.439]  Just leaving that out, but there's articles all over the local papers here, all over the national papers.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:44.081]  Rabbi says passion already fueling hatred.
[01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:52.212]  The head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center says the movie needs to not be shown, needs to be edited, needs to be boycotted.
[01:06:53.613 --> 01:06:56.894]  Word for word, the New Testament, exactly what the Bible says.
[01:06:57.154 --> 01:06:58.294]  But that's anti-Semitic.
[01:06:58.754 --> 01:07:01.555]  That's bad when Jesus was a Jew, folks.
[01:07:01.595 --> 01:07:02.456]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:07:02.856 --> 01:07:11.819]  It's about using what happened to the Jews in World War II, which was a terrible thing, as a political tool for anybody who wants to basically rent it.
[01:07:12.637 --> 01:07:18.460]  You just rent it and they'll say somebody, you know, it's like Steve Voss sings this Christian conservative music.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.401]  We play his music here.
[01:07:19.721 --> 01:07:20.701]  Ever worried about anybody?
[01:07:20.941 --> 01:07:22.302]  They list him in the digital hate.
[01:07:22.983 --> 01:07:27.185]  They list local gun groups that are here in Austin that have got black people that head them.
[01:07:27.445 --> 01:07:28.205]  It doesn't matter.
[01:07:28.485 --> 01:07:30.667]  You're conservative, you're pro-America, you're a Nazi.
[01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:37.070]  But when you're a real grade-A Nazi, the product of an SS marriage, who says he loves Hitler, you're good.
[01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:38.631]  Now that makes me mad!
[01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:43.892]  Republicans ought to vote to keep Gray Davis and
[01:08:02.771 --> 01:08:05.614]  And let him bite the bullet and make the $38 billion in cuts.
[01:08:06.094 --> 01:08:10.258]  Why would a Republican want to go in there and have to bite the bullet?
[01:08:10.558 --> 01:08:13.380]  Look, Davis was in the Energy Commission.
[01:08:13.681 --> 01:08:15.162]  Davis was doing the deals with Enron.
[01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:18.345]  This is all totally staged.
[01:08:19.326 --> 01:08:20.266]  One more thing, quick.
[01:08:20.727 --> 01:08:24.190]  If Larry Flynn is worth $400 million, what do you think Hugh Hefner's worth?
[01:08:25.371 --> 01:08:26.332]  A lot more than that.
[01:08:26.672 --> 01:08:26.992]  Really?
[01:08:28.013 --> 01:08:28.674]  More than Flynn's?
[01:08:29.504 --> 01:08:35.566]  Oh, I would, well, he doesn't own as much of the hardcore porn business, but Flint spent a lot of his money.
[01:08:35.606 --> 01:08:36.827]  He owns a lot of the porn business.
[01:08:37.487 --> 01:08:38.227]  I didn't know that.
[01:08:39.288 --> 01:08:43.009]  Yeah, they're big, I've read, in the production of hardcore porn.
[01:08:43.089 --> 01:08:45.490]  Wow, Larry Flint, he's a sick man, isn't he?
[01:08:46.491 --> 01:08:49.792]  Ha, it's Larry Flint.
[01:08:50.152 --> 01:08:51.413]  At least you know what you got with him.
[01:08:51.433 --> 01:08:52.273]  Yeah, he is sick.
[01:08:52.513 --> 01:08:53.873]  Gosh, you have a good night.
[01:08:54.054 --> 01:08:54.714]  You too, buddy.
[01:08:55.574 --> 01:08:57.595]  Yeah, he's something else, a bag of pus.
[01:08:59.045 --> 01:08:59.986]  I'm an anti-Semitic.
[01:09:00.046 --> 01:09:01.387]  I call Larry Flynn a name.
[01:09:02.087 --> 01:09:02.948]  I love America.
[01:09:03.068 --> 01:09:04.048]  I'm anti-Semitic.
[01:09:04.609 --> 01:09:05.629]  I'm against Hitler.
[01:09:05.849 --> 01:09:06.950]  Oh, you're anti-Semitic!
[01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:11.013]  I worship Jesus, you Nazi!
[01:09:11.573 --> 01:09:12.714]  Now, this is the new system.
[01:09:12.754 --> 01:09:14.655]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[01:09:15.095 --> 01:09:15.896]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:09:17.077 --> 01:09:19.138]  Okay, Richard's next, I'm being told.
[01:09:19.578 --> 01:09:20.859]  Richard, where are you calling from?
[01:09:20.919 --> 01:09:21.319]  Michigan?
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:23.020]  Yes, calling from Michigan.
[01:09:23.221 --> 01:09:24.021]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:09:24.802 --> 01:09:27.403]  Yeah, I've got a few things to say about that.
[01:09:28.284 --> 01:09:28.344]  Uh...
[01:09:29.591 --> 01:09:34.435]  For one, let I'll be governor.
[01:09:34.816 --> 01:09:37.198]  You know, that whole state's going to go under anyway.
[01:09:37.218 --> 01:09:47.086]  According to Dimitri Duderman and some other well-known prophets of the day, they're going to be nuked.
[01:09:48.668 --> 01:09:52.751]  So, you know, what's the big hassle?
[01:09:52.811 --> 01:09:56.955]  But, you know, I can understand a lot of people's view on that, too.
[01:09:57.879 --> 01:10:06.690]  I don't particularly like the guy, especially finding out more about him and how he acts and things.
[01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:07.451]  Now, wait a minute.
[01:10:07.571 --> 01:10:11.716]  If you were against him, who's an admitted Nazi, that means you're anti-Semitic.
[01:10:11.856 --> 01:10:13.958]  Now, to be a real Nazi is good.
[01:10:14.299 --> 01:10:17.042]  To be a good American is anti-Semitic.
[01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:22.850]  To love Jews is anti-Semitic.
[01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:27.352]  To hate them is good, according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[01:10:27.673 --> 01:10:37.377]  Well, I'm a hardcore Christian, and I believe in the Bill of Rights.
[01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:39.143]  And all that.
[01:10:39.443 --> 01:10:48.653]  And I also believe that the Jews that are accomplished in Jerusalem are not the true Israel people.
[01:10:49.414 --> 01:10:55.160]  And therefore, they can call me anti-Semitic.
[01:10:55.281 --> 01:10:58.284]  I know who I am, and I know who they are, and they're a bunch of snakes.
[01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:03.973]  Well, that will probably be given approval.
[01:11:04.373 --> 01:11:05.434]  Thanks for the call.
[01:11:05.994 --> 01:11:07.956]  That is loving and good.
[01:11:09.637 --> 01:11:12.920]  If they like Arnold, they'll probably love what you just said.
[01:11:15.082 --> 01:11:17.624]  But no, certainly Christ warned about that.
[01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:18.985]  Wolves in sheep's clothing.
[01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.266]  He warned about false prophets.
[01:11:20.626 --> 01:11:21.367]  And that's what you have.
[01:11:21.387 --> 01:11:26.230]  You have these false doctrines of you've got to support Israel wrong or right.
[01:11:26.591 --> 01:11:26.711]  And
[01:11:27.503 --> 01:11:28.024]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:11:28.044 --> 01:11:33.048]  The Bible says over and over again that when Israel's bad, God judges it.
[01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:36.551]  And it talks about the evil leaders.
[01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:38.393]  I mean, we have evil leaders in America.
[01:11:39.193 --> 01:11:40.535]  We have evil leaders in Israel.
[01:11:40.555 --> 01:11:41.896]  We have evil leaders in Germany.
[01:11:41.936 --> 01:11:47.461]  I mean, Helmut Kohl was pretty bad, but Gerhard Schroeder's a lot worse.
[01:11:47.481 --> 01:11:50.944]  They got evil people in communist China.
[01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:56.529]  But, you know, it's supposedly, oh, this one country, you've got to support, got to support.
[01:11:56.849 --> 01:12:00.291]  Does that mean, then, if Israel had Hitler running it, we'd have to support Hitler?
[01:12:01.632 --> 01:12:07.755]  And a lot of counterpunch, which is very liberal, but a lot of respected writers like Alexander Cockburn, who writes for the L.A.
[01:12:07.775 --> 01:12:15.480]  Times, they've written articles about how the Zionists actually, they have published letters, were actually supporting Hitler.
[01:12:16.798 --> 01:12:18.578]  And you've actually got like a two-tiered system.
[01:12:18.598 --> 01:12:29.440]  You've got the people that aren't real Jews that pose as Jews who actually get caught over and over again supporting Nazi-type organizations that are exterminating Jews.
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:30.460]  It's horrible.
[01:12:32.301 --> 01:12:37.342]  And it's, again, the New World Order is an expert at posing as one thing and really being another.
[01:12:38.342 --> 01:12:39.562]  I mean, how do you explain this?
[01:12:39.622 --> 01:12:44.123]  How does the Simon Wiesenthal Center come out and support Arnold Schwarzenegger
[01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:56.461]  Who says that he admires Hitler and he supports the former UN chief and former top Nazi, one of the top Nazis in the extermination camps in Serbia.
[01:12:58.302 --> 01:13:00.843]  I mean, this picture's from a year ago with him.
[01:13:00.863 --> 01:13:01.824]  He vacations with him.
[01:13:02.064 --> 01:13:03.165]  He's a family friend.
[01:13:04.305 --> 01:13:08.448]  His mother, after his dad died, he was a Nazi too, married into the head of the parliament.
[01:13:08.488 --> 01:13:09.849]  He was a former top Nazi.
[01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:13.531]  This guy's all over the place, folks.
[01:13:18.251 --> 01:13:19.351]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:13:20.172 --> 01:13:21.532]  He's a member of Bohemian Grove.
[01:13:21.572 --> 01:13:26.854]  He says he doesn't like Jesus Christ, doesn't like Christians, in his own book, Evolution of a Bodybuilder.
[01:13:28.575 --> 01:13:33.457]  He's for abortion, for gun control, for homosexuals adopting children.
[01:13:33.497 --> 01:13:34.657]  That's called conservative?
[01:13:34.857 --> 01:13:36.158]  And the conservatives are defending him?
[01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:38.259]  I mean, it's crazy, folks.
[01:13:39.319 --> 01:13:43.941]  He's like this anointed creature, and it's a sick, sick joke.
[01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:47.691]  I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:13:48.111 --> 01:13:51.833]  I'm not going to put up with people that support a Nazi and say he's good.
[01:13:52.093 --> 01:13:53.414]  I got their quotes right here.
[01:13:54.014 --> 01:13:59.397]  And then attack Mel Gibson for making a film that's a word-for-word translation from the Bible.
[01:14:02.478 --> 01:14:12.604]  Where Christ says the corrupt church of the day, you guys are a bunch of snakes and don't care about the people, and they tell Pontius Pilate, kill him, and they do.
[01:14:13.337 --> 01:14:16.658]  That's all the movie does, and they're going, ban it, ban it, shut it down.
[01:14:16.978 --> 01:14:19.058]  No, it's anti-Semitic evil, evil.
[01:14:19.519 --> 01:14:22.919]  Meanwhile, Mr. Hitler, Mr. Schwarzenegger's jumping around.
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:25.200]  I love Hitler.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.521]  And they're like, oh, we love Mr. Schwarzenegger.
[01:14:27.561 --> 01:14:31.162]  He's such a good member and a great friend to all Jews.
[01:14:31.202 --> 01:14:32.922]  I mean, it's sick, folks.
[01:14:34.262 --> 01:14:36.623]  The level of all this stuff is off the charts now.
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:41.423]  The level of this, I mean, you know, they're going to bet on what U.S.
[01:14:41.463 --> 01:14:42.864]  soldiers die at the Pentagon.
[01:14:42.884 --> 01:14:43.985]  They're going to surveil us.
[01:14:44.265 --> 01:14:47.928]  They're going to have a total information awareness network.
[01:14:47.948 --> 01:14:49.329]  They want to put microchips in us.
[01:14:49.649 --> 01:14:51.811]  The ADL supports Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:14:52.272 --> 01:14:53.873]  And the Simon Wiesenthal Center does.
[01:14:54.393 --> 01:14:56.155]  I mean, that's all off the charts, folks.
[01:14:56.435 --> 01:14:57.596]  Just all so crazy.
[01:14:58.116 --> 01:14:58.997]  Right out in plain view.
[01:14:59.357 --> 01:15:00.638]  Ron in New York, go ahead.
[01:15:00.939 --> 01:15:01.419]  Hi, Alex.
[01:15:02.938 --> 01:15:05.821]  Just, I'm going to digress for a moment with Ann Coulter.
[01:15:05.841 --> 01:15:06.682]  You know, it's funny.
[01:15:07.062 --> 01:15:08.003]  You call her a creature.
[01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:18.995]  When she first came on the scene about five or six years ago in a more prominent way, I can even remember my wife saying at that time that she looked like one of the lizard people from V, if you remember that old TV series.
[01:15:19.035 --> 01:15:19.455]  Yeah, she does.
[01:15:19.475 --> 01:15:21.157]  She looks like the talking head lizard baby.
[01:15:21.197 --> 01:15:22.018]  Do you remember that?
[01:15:22.566 --> 01:15:23.247]  It really does.
[01:15:23.327 --> 01:15:25.089]  It's funny.
[01:15:25.149 --> 01:15:26.511]  My wife reminded me of that.
[01:15:26.631 --> 01:15:27.893]  Sorry.
[01:15:28.073 --> 01:15:29.294]  Yeah, I'm so sick of these.
[01:15:29.715 --> 01:15:31.637]  How do these neocons support Arnold?
[01:15:32.178 --> 01:15:39.607]  Let me tell you something about this Schwarzenegger thing, and I want you and your audience to consider what I'm going to say because it adds up logically, okay?
[01:15:40.908 --> 01:15:41.769]  He's a good American.
[01:15:41.869 --> 01:15:42.929]  He came to this country in 1968.
[01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:51.435]  He didn't seek his citizenship until sometime in the very late 70s, early 80s.
[01:15:52.016 --> 01:15:52.856]  Now, why is that?
[01:15:52.876 --> 01:15:55.598]  He got his citizenship and kept his other citizenship in 83.
[01:15:55.878 --> 01:15:57.279]  That's right.
[01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:58.640]  He finally got his citizenship.
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:02.783]  He said because he was considering being Austrian president.
[01:16:03.964 --> 01:16:05.705]  Listen, just listen to my theory with this.
[01:16:06.494 --> 01:16:10.277]  Is it possible he didn't want to become an American citizen during the Vietnam War?
[01:16:10.317 --> 01:16:17.623]  He might have been subject to induction into the very war that he makes all his movies about, you know, tough guy, warrior, soldier.
[01:16:18.263 --> 01:16:20.385]  Well, yeah, he went AWOL from the Army.
[01:16:21.226 --> 01:16:22.527]  In Austria, that's correct.
[01:16:22.547 --> 01:16:25.009]  But that's okay, because Dowdy was so high up.
[01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:25.749]  That's right.
[01:16:25.929 --> 01:16:26.790]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:27.571]  I'll let you finish up.
[01:16:28.532 --> 01:16:32.735]  Oh, yeah, but understand, Ron, you're anti-Semitic now because you're against a real live Nazi.
[01:16:34.812 --> 01:16:36.438]  Oh, yes.
[01:16:36.839 --> 01:16:38.064]  Mel Gibson's bad, folks.
[01:16:38.124 --> 01:16:38.706]  He's bad.
[01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:40.673]  But Arnold's good.
[01:16:42.754 --> 01:16:44.335]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:16:44.715 --> 01:16:50.458]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:16:50.718 --> 01:16:55.861]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:16:56.201 --> 01:17:05.505]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:17:05.845 --> 01:17:06.686]  It's rechargeable 8-lane
[01:17:06.986 --> 01:17:12.309]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:17:26.696 --> 01:17:32.926]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:17:32.967 --> 01:17:33.948]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:17:34.008 --> 01:17:35.210]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:17:42.961 --> 01:17:45.543]  Hardly a day goes by in the garden without the Cobra Head.
[01:17:45.723 --> 01:17:48.605]  I want to tell you about a great little garden tool called the Cobra Head.
[01:17:48.766 --> 01:17:54.610]  First, take half of the tools you're currently using in the garden, throw them away, and call 1-866-YO-COBRA.
[01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:57.032]  The Cobra Head is like having a steel fingernail.
[01:17:57.192 --> 01:18:03.137]  This tool plants, scalps, cultivates, transplants, dethatches, harvests, furrows, digs, you name it.
[01:18:03.257 --> 01:18:04.418]  The Cobra Head can do it.
[01:18:04.678 --> 01:18:10.122]  With the Cobra Head, I can make quick work out of weeding my garden beds, especially between the garden rows where space is tight.
[01:18:10.482 --> 01:18:12.904]  I love to spend time in the garden as any gardener does.
[01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:15.407]  But now my time in the garden is a lot more productive.
[01:18:15.627 --> 01:18:21.993]  The Cobra Head handheld multi-purpose garden tool has certainly earned my personal stamp of approval and I'd recommend it to anyone.
[01:18:22.173 --> 01:18:23.555]  But don't take my word for it.
[01:18:23.635 --> 01:18:30.881]  The Cobra Head just received the recommendation and seal of approval from the National Home Gardening Club after being tested by 200 members.
[01:18:31.342 --> 01:18:32.343]  Don't wait another minute.
[01:18:32.723 --> 01:18:35.785]  Call toll-free 1-866-YO-COBRA.
[01:18:36.065 --> 01:18:36.546]  That's 1-866-962-6272.

[01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:45.452]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[01:18:45.672 --> 01:18:51.996]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[01:18:52.296 --> 01:18:58.180]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them, but still have them safe and sound?
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.383]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax-exempt?
[01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:04.643]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[01:19:04.903 --> 01:19:05.744]  Well, there is a way.
[01:19:06.004 --> 01:19:12.110]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[01:19:12.490 --> 01:19:22.760]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:23.621]  Constitution.
[01:19:23.901 --> 01:19:25.542]  You don't have to go offshore to do it, either.
[01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:28.105]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[01:19:28.545 --> 01:19:36.253]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the Internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[01:19:36.534 --> 01:19:40.958]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[01:19:43.036 --> 01:19:46.200]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.642]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[01:19:49.003 --> 01:19:51.586]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[01:19:51.966 --> 01:19:56.511]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[01:19:56.711 --> 01:19:58.473]  But you have to act now!
[01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:04.880]  With $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I've seen in my 24 years in the business.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.902]  At the nearest of melt in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[01:20:33.131 --> 01:20:33.231]  800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.351 --> 01:20:37.595]  That's Midas at 800-686-2237.
[01:20:37.715 --> 01:21:00.475]  Understand the only reason I'm talking about this Arnold Schwarzenegger situation is because it just shows how the government, the media, is selling mental illness.
[01:21:02.404 --> 01:21:23.918]  I mean, you've got this person who says he hates Christians and that he's God and that he despises Christians in his own book, and he's for all these things that Bill Clinton was for and more, and I turn the TV on for five minutes and neocons are going, oh, he's so good, we ought to all follow him.
[01:21:24.378 --> 01:21:25.059]  Oh, this is great.
[01:21:25.199 --> 01:21:27.581]  So what if he's liberal, I heard Hannity say?
[01:21:30.082 --> 01:21:31.083]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:21:31.872 --> 01:21:43.137]  And then the Simon Wiesenthal Senator comes out and defends him while attacking out of the same mouth, same person attacking a good American like Mel Gibson.
[01:21:43.217 --> 01:21:45.999]  And yes, he's an American, folks, contrary to popular belief.
[01:21:46.379 --> 01:21:48.120]  Born here.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.481]  By the way, Senator Orrin Hatch has a new law.
[01:21:50.501 --> 01:21:53.242]  I'll talk about it so foreigners can be president.
[01:21:53.923 --> 01:21:58.825]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron, finish up, then I'll go to Kevin in Pennsylvania.
[01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:01.558]  Spencer, John, Ed, and others.
[01:22:01.599 --> 01:22:02.259]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[01:22:02.279 --> 01:22:03.700]  I mean, go ahead, Ron.
[01:22:04.481 --> 01:22:10.645]  Alex, Schwarzenegger is obviously the designate by the power oligarchy elite.
[01:22:11.245 --> 01:22:17.330]  I mean, they've been grooming him, and he's had aspirations for some political power going as far back as the 80s.
[01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:20.392]  It was reported, and I find this strange, that in 1984...
[01:22:21.923 --> 01:22:25.268]  He went out of his way to contact Simon Wiesenthal.
[01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:32.698]  Now, why would he, if there was nothing to worry about, go out of his way to contact the Wiesenthal Center?
[01:22:32.999 --> 01:22:34.381]  And now he's paid over $5 million.
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.121]  So they'll worship him.
[01:22:37.481 --> 01:22:42.104]  Right, because he knew, even as far back then, he was involved with Maria Shriver.
[01:22:42.204 --> 01:22:44.706]  He was engaged to be married to her at the time.
[01:22:45.247 --> 01:22:47.928]  He knew he had political aspirations for the future.
[01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:49.069]  Wait a minute.
[01:22:49.109 --> 01:22:52.411]  Hey, hey, they made Pumping Iron like 75, 76.
[01:22:52.632 --> 01:22:53.912]  That's right.
[01:22:53.933 --> 01:22:57.895]  The guy's on tape saying, I love Hitler, I want to be president, ha, ha, ha.
[01:22:57.955 --> 01:22:58.876]  And you know something else?
[01:22:59.256 --> 01:23:00.777]  I remember him on a talk show.
[01:23:00.897 --> 01:23:06.361]  It may have been Johnny Carson or it might have been the old Merv Griffin talk show in the 70s.
[01:23:06.861 --> 01:23:09.223]  And it struck me as a young man as really strange.
[01:23:09.883 --> 01:23:13.385]  They asked him, you know, about that persona, like the German Nazi thing.
[01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:15.507]  And he said, and he was like laughing, giggling about it.
[01:23:15.527 --> 01:23:17.368]  He goes, well, you know, I can understand.
[01:23:17.388 --> 01:23:21.290]  He goes, you know, the aggression, the power of the black uniforms.
[01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:23.372]  I remember him saying that on a talk show.
[01:23:23.812 --> 01:23:24.632]  And I thought it was odd.
[01:23:24.672 --> 01:23:28.235]  I said, I thought he was going to catch some hell for it even back then.
[01:23:28.776 --> 01:23:30.401]  So it wasn't as sensitive as it is now.
[01:23:30.501 --> 01:23:31.002]  He never did.
[01:23:32.043 --> 01:23:33.884]  That was on a talk show back in the 70s.
[01:23:33.964 --> 01:23:36.105]  It was either on a Johnny Carson show, is my memory.
[01:23:36.125 --> 01:23:38.086]  The guy says he likes Hitler.
[01:23:38.267 --> 01:23:39.527]  He admires Hitler.
[01:23:40.007 --> 01:23:42.229]  And he's got a Simon Wiesenthal stamp.
[01:23:42.649 --> 01:23:46.291]  And then last year, he's hanging out with Kirk Voltheim.
[01:23:46.811 --> 01:23:50.793]  He goes, everyone, I must talk to you at the reception.
[01:23:51.054 --> 01:23:53.655]  I want to thank... I love Kirk Voltheim.
[01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:54.796]  I do not apologize.
[01:23:54.876 --> 01:23:55.616]  I love him.
[01:23:55.936 --> 01:23:56.557]  I love him.
[01:23:56.857 --> 01:24:00.519]  And then he says, mommy's married to some former Nazi colonel and...
[01:24:00.959 --> 01:24:02.840]  I mean, he's off the charts, man.
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:10.942]  The attempts, listen, whether you want to hold his father's behavior against him or not, we have to be accurate and truthful about his father's history.
[01:24:11.442 --> 01:24:15.403]  People are trying to, and I happen to know this history a little bit because you know what?
[01:24:15.803 --> 01:24:17.803]  I come from the same ethnic background as Arnold.
[01:24:17.983 --> 01:24:18.323]  I know.
[01:24:18.343 --> 01:24:20.044]  He ain't fooling me, but I know.
[01:24:20.964 --> 01:24:23.145]  His father was in the SA.
[01:24:23.585 --> 01:24:25.385]  The SA were not soldiers.
[01:24:25.845 --> 01:24:28.646]  They were round-shirt political thugs.
[01:24:29.221 --> 01:24:30.322]  They were headbreakers.
[01:24:30.402 --> 01:24:31.743]  They were never soldiers.
[01:24:32.343 --> 01:24:37.266]  His father was a member of the SA before Germany had annexed Austria.
[01:24:37.667 --> 01:24:45.232]  His father was part of a movement within Austria to Nazify Austria and unite it with Germany.
[01:24:45.352 --> 01:24:47.273]  That's all admitted in the German and British Papers.
[01:24:47.313 --> 01:24:48.274]  I was reading over it.
[01:24:48.314 --> 01:24:54.198]  Here they keep talking about his dad as though the Germans went in and forced him into the military as a Wehrmacht conscript.
[01:24:54.558 --> 01:24:55.098]  Not so.
[01:24:55.519 --> 01:24:55.939]  Not true.
[01:24:55.959 --> 01:24:56.399]  Look, folks.
[01:24:59.582 --> 01:25:03.226]  The guy vacations with Kirk Voltheim.
[01:25:03.646 --> 01:25:08.312]  There's photos of him now hanging out with him.
[01:25:09.233 --> 01:25:15.941]  His mother, when his dad died, married the head of the parliament, the number two position, this former top Nazi.
[01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:18.251]  He calls him uncle.
[01:25:18.471 --> 01:25:20.511]  Try to hear Hannity address anything like that.
[01:25:21.092 --> 01:25:21.392]  It won't.
[01:25:21.432 --> 01:25:26.554]  Hannity worships at the temple of this guy almost every evening since he's announced his candidacy.
[01:25:26.634 --> 01:25:30.755]  I've heard him say, and I've only watched it one time, he goes, I had to turn it off, I almost threw up.
[01:25:30.795 --> 01:25:32.596]  He goes, so what if he's a liberal?
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.521]  I like him!
[01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:43.872]  And ask yourself, too, when have you ever seen such softball interviews where the guy literally, literally refuses to respond to a question and they just let him slide right off the ropes?
[01:25:44.332 --> 01:25:47.536]  If that was Ron Paul or Phil Tancredo, you think they'd let him go that easy?
[01:25:47.996 --> 01:25:49.078]  I don't think the press would.
[01:25:49.158 --> 01:25:54.584]  This guy, listen, this guy is vicarious extension of Kennedy political power.
[01:25:55.279 --> 01:25:57.340]  This is all theatrics with him.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.923]  He serves only two purposes as a piece on their chessboard.
[01:26:01.383 --> 01:26:06.426]  It's either A, get in power, do what they want, or B, make sure that Gray Davis retains power.
[01:26:06.907 --> 01:26:08.528]  It's one or the other.
[01:26:08.968 --> 01:26:09.929]  Absolutely, thanks.
[01:26:10.049 --> 01:26:11.510]  I mean, folks, I'm just blown away.
[01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:15.653]  The guy's walking around saying I love Hitler in front of cameras.
[01:26:16.293 --> 01:26:19.075]  And the Simon Wiesenthal Center is worshiping him.
[01:26:19.275 --> 01:26:22.177]  And then attacking Mel Gibson for a wholesome movie.
[01:26:22.297 --> 01:26:25.059]  Word for word out of the Bible, they're talking about banning it.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.904]  I mean, I just, I will not stand here and watch this anymore.
[01:26:29.786 --> 01:26:30.967]  We'll be back with more of your calls.
[01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:34.031]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.512 --> 01:26:36.114]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.036 --> 01:26:39.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.998 --> 01:26:43.939]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[01:26:43.959 --> 01:26:51.165]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[01:26:51.445 --> 01:26:53.847]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national... 803-4438.
[01:26:53.887 --> 01:26:54.948]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:26:54.968 --> 01:26:55.908]  I know you're out there.
[01:26:55.969 --> 01:26:56.609]  I can feel you now.
[01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:57.250]  I know that you're afraid.
[01:27:12.421 --> 01:27:13.242]  You're afraid of us.
[01:27:13.262 --> 01:27:16.383]  You're afraid of change.
[01:27:17.244 --> 01:27:18.184]  I don't know the future.
[01:27:19.185 --> 01:27:21.386]  I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.
[01:27:21.446 --> 01:27:24.648]  I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.
[01:27:24.668 --> 01:27:30.150]  I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.
[01:27:31.111 --> 01:27:35.153]  I'm going to show them a world without you.
[01:27:35.253 --> 01:27:36.554]  A world without controls.
[01:27:39.955 --> 01:27:42.777]  Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.
[01:27:43.638 --> 01:27:49.283]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:49.303 --> 01:27:56.388]  Waging war on corruption, carashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:27:56.408 --> 01:28:00.532]  I've been talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger tonight, the icon.
[01:28:02.163 --> 01:28:11.108]  The archetypal Hercules character who says on tape that he admires Hitler and he hangs out with Nazis.
[01:28:12.129 --> 01:28:16.871]  Well, the Simon Wiesenthal Center loves him because he's paid him five million plus dollars, of course.
[01:28:17.772 --> 01:28:23.255]  But that doesn't stop him from attacking Mel Gibson for his movie The Passion, which is not anti-Semitic.
[01:28:23.335 --> 01:28:25.116]  It's historical fact.
[01:28:27.049 --> 01:28:28.292]  Oh, it's incredible.
[01:28:28.552 --> 01:28:35.584]  I do got a bunch of other news I want to get into, but this story is just so indicative of the craziness and the mindlessness of it all.
[01:28:36.886 --> 01:28:39.811]  And it is serving as a giant diversion as the globalist.
[01:28:40.419 --> 01:28:41.060]  Hey, Alex, am I on?
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:41.500]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.260]  Pennsylvania.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.361]  That's okay.
[01:28:43.381 --> 01:28:43.461]  Okay.
[01:29:09.178 --> 01:29:19.862]  Number one, I'd like to say that Police State 3 Total Enslavement is very good, and I like how it gets real fast in the second half of it.
[01:29:21.063 --> 01:29:31.047]  You know, when you talk about the very chip and all the... Oh, and the lady that was on, talking about the RFID chips, was on Coast to Coast.
[01:29:31.107 --> 01:29:34.188]  She was on another program that was on shortwave a few months ago.
[01:29:35.058 --> 01:29:36.879]  I don't know if you know who she is.
[01:29:37.439 --> 01:29:38.020]  Caspian?
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:39.420]  Catherine Albrecht?
[01:29:40.001 --> 01:29:40.601]  I don't know her name.
[01:29:40.621 --> 01:29:50.406]  We've been interviewing her for two years, and we broke the story with her on air about the RFID chips and the Pentagon and the plan to track everything.
[01:29:50.546 --> 01:29:54.247]  Hey, what's with the First Union going over to watch over you?
[01:29:56.168 --> 01:30:00.430]  Is that thrown in our face with the thumbprint at First Union?
[01:30:01.451 --> 01:30:02.591]  Now it's watch over you.
[01:30:03.012 --> 01:30:03.552]  Walk over you?
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.480]  I'm having trouble understanding you.
[01:30:07.381 --> 01:30:08.361]  Sorry, can you hear me now?
[01:30:08.841 --> 01:30:09.821]  I can hear you.
[01:30:10.061 --> 01:30:12.081]  I'm not quite following what you're saying.
[01:30:12.282 --> 01:30:12.782]  All right.
[01:30:13.282 --> 01:30:16.562]  The First Union Bank changed over to Wachovia.
[01:30:16.582 --> 01:30:17.783]  Do you know that?
[01:30:19.623 --> 01:30:20.163]  Okay.
[01:30:20.243 --> 01:30:22.864]  But if you look at it, it's like it says, Wachovia.
[01:30:23.644 --> 01:30:24.304]  Wachovia.
[01:30:24.924 --> 01:30:29.785]  Well, there's a lot of stuff in your face, but the thumb printing, the biometrics, yes, it's...
[01:30:30.791 --> 01:30:34.193]  So what was Catherine Albrecht saying on these national shows?
[01:30:34.833 --> 01:30:40.536]  Oh, about the RFID track and trace, what you buy, what you like, reasons everywhere?
[01:30:40.556 --> 01:30:43.658]  Yeah.
[01:30:44.738 --> 01:30:51.762]  But understand, they claimed it was just for tracking goods, but now it turns out the documents got released about a month ago.
[01:30:53.443 --> 01:30:59.746]  Walmart, Target, Gillette, the manufacturers, Procter & Gamble, in secret meetings,
[01:31:00.313 --> 01:31:11.476]  With Homeland Security to totally track and tax and enslave us and how they want to sell us this casual society and this tracking society in the name of fighting terror.
[01:31:12.056 --> 01:31:13.076]  So cynical.
[01:31:13.476 --> 01:31:21.418]  Their whole agenda of police state and surveillance is all being rammed through using terror, folks.
[01:31:21.538 --> 01:31:23.838]  It's all on the record.
[01:31:23.858 --> 01:31:24.419]  Yeah.
[01:31:25.739 --> 01:31:25.879]  And...
[01:31:27.585 --> 01:31:28.126]  Let's see.
[01:31:28.146 --> 01:31:29.607]  What else did I want to mention?
[01:31:29.647 --> 01:31:32.971]  Yeah, I'm getting the information out.
[01:31:36.395 --> 01:31:39.779]  Oh, by the way, remember when I called in and I told you about that thing?
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:43.704]  They busted me for buying cigarettes for these underage kids.
[01:31:43.724 --> 01:31:45.226]  It was like a secret police... I don't really remember.
[01:31:45.266 --> 01:31:45.646]  No, sir.
[01:31:47.771 --> 01:31:53.756]  Well, I bought these cigarettes for this kid that was underage, and it was like the secret police got me.
[01:31:54.317 --> 01:31:55.398]  Nothing happened with it.
[01:31:55.958 --> 01:31:58.660]  Like, these thug cops came over right after I did it.
[01:31:59.661 --> 01:32:01.303]  Well, yeah, the borders are wide open.
[01:32:01.323 --> 01:32:05.126]  They say we're about to be hit with all these weapons, but they're grabbing you for cigarettes.
[01:32:05.166 --> 01:32:05.967]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[01:32:06.027 --> 01:32:06.867]  I really appreciate it.
[01:32:07.008 --> 01:32:07.388]  Take care.
[01:32:08.297 --> 01:32:11.418]  Okay, now let's go to Spencer in Ohio.
[01:32:11.478 --> 01:32:12.759]  Spencer, go ahead.
[01:32:13.199 --> 01:32:14.199]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:19.982]  The Grove handpicked Arnold like Mr. Reagan, so he's obviously going to be our next president.
[01:32:20.302 --> 01:32:23.003]  Well, yeah, and Nixon and everybody else.
[01:32:23.043 --> 01:32:25.704]  For those that don't know, tell them what the Bohemian Grove is.
[01:32:25.804 --> 01:32:33.227]  San Francisco Chronicle admitted a month ago when everybody said he wouldn't run, it said the Grove told Arnold, we want you.
[01:32:34.278 --> 01:32:44.006]  And as you mentioned in your film, Mr. Greenspan is also a Grove member, so I don't think Arnold's going to repeal the Federal Reserve Act like JFK intended to when he signed Executive Order 11110.
[01:32:44.606 --> 01:32:46.888]  Now that's the weird thing.
[01:32:46.948 --> 01:32:54.074]  He's married into the Kennedys who are also pro-Nazi, but then JFK went the other direction and was not a member of the Grove.
[01:32:55.215 --> 01:32:56.316]  Why do you think that's the case?
[01:32:57.651 --> 01:33:04.413]  Well, as Alexander Hamilton said, a nation which can't prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one, Alex.
[01:33:04.933 --> 01:33:12.576]  And Kurt Waldheim signed in that genocide convention treaty with Mr. Carter back in 77, so Clinton could carry it out for 1999.
[01:33:13.756 --> 01:33:18.618]  And they signed over the Panama Canal, and Gerald Ford and Lady Bird were also present.
[01:33:18.878 --> 01:33:21.119]  Was Arnold present at that signing as well?
[01:33:21.939 --> 01:33:25.460]  I don't know, but he is a darling of them, isn't he?
[01:33:26.593 --> 01:33:34.896]  Yes, sir, and I think Jeffrey Hunter did a fine job as Jesus in King of Kings, and according to that film, Jesus was a Galilean.
[01:33:35.236 --> 01:33:36.297]  That's what the Bible says.
[01:33:36.317 --> 01:33:38.158]  Isn't that why the Jews wanted to kill him?
[01:33:39.858 --> 01:33:48.822]  Well, all I know is the Pharisees, I mean, that's the Bible, and they're trying to ban it in Europe by a BBC News article saying the Bible's racist.
[01:33:49.568 --> 01:33:53.491]  And now the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center are attacking Mel Gibson.
[01:33:53.531 --> 01:34:03.619]  His film is an exact translation of the Old Testament into Hebrew and Aramaic and Latin.
[01:34:03.999 --> 01:34:05.360]  And they want it banned.
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:06.681]  They want it shut down.
[01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:10.564]  But they love somebody called Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:34:10.604 --> 01:34:14.687]  I got articles with the same Simon Wiesenthal heads as they love Arnold.
[01:34:15.187 --> 01:34:16.808]  The guy says he likes Hitler, by the way.
[01:34:17.089 --> 01:34:18.810]  Arnold says that on the record in Pumping Iron.
[01:34:19.764 --> 01:34:26.931]  But this guy's over here saying that Mel Gibson's bad.
[01:34:28.232 --> 01:34:31.054]  Well, you've got to remember, Hitler was a sickle group, wasn't he?
[01:34:32.235 --> 01:34:34.797]  Well, he was an illegitimate Rothschild, that is admitted.
[01:34:35.318 --> 01:34:36.038]  Thanks for the call.
[01:34:36.098 --> 01:34:43.745]  Yeah, his daddy was the illegitimate son, and it turns out mommy was too.
[01:34:46.206 --> 01:34:48.247]  Man, talk about a bloodline of the Illuminati.
[01:34:48.947 --> 01:34:50.868]  Let's go ahead and talk.
[01:34:51.948 --> 01:34:54.209]  Let's go ahead and now talk to John in Florida.
[01:34:54.249 --> 01:34:55.250]  Thanks for holding, John.
[01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:56.611]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:34:56.751 --> 01:34:57.331]  Pretty good, sir.
[01:34:58.672 --> 01:35:01.034]  I brought your Police Day 3 a while back.
[01:35:01.074 --> 01:35:02.875]  I've made copies of it.
[01:35:02.955 --> 01:35:04.576]  It's hard to get people to even watch it.
[01:35:04.916 --> 01:35:06.878]  They're too busy or this or that or the next thing.
[01:35:07.238 --> 01:35:09.039]  I listened to your show last night.
[01:35:09.079 --> 01:35:09.800]  It was a day show.
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:14.963]  And I did watch that segment of the college kids that disappeared for two weeks.
[01:35:15.403 --> 01:35:22.868]  And I remember the FBI woman, you made a comment about that, the FBI woman saying that this should be illegal for a person just to be able to disappear.
[01:35:23.963 --> 01:35:31.771]  Yeah, you should have to give your name when you get gas or when you get an ATM or when you buy anything for everyone's safety.
[01:35:32.452 --> 01:35:40.480]  Yeah, that hit me because I usually don't watch TV, but I watched that Sunday night on one of the shows and then the caller called in.
[01:35:41.464 --> 01:35:43.365]  And I remember that.
[01:35:43.785 --> 01:35:52.790]  What about Paul Watson saying, our webmaster, that on an episode of Frasier, he joins the gun club and the whole time, oh, it's so bad you did this.
[01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:54.250]  Oh, it's so horrible.
[01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:55.431]  Everybody's looking down on him.
[01:35:55.451 --> 01:35:58.012]  And then he goes to the gun club and they're all hiding in the back.
[01:35:58.032 --> 01:35:58.913]  And he goes, what's going on?
[01:35:58.933 --> 01:36:01.854]  They go, we're building a machine to defeat the New World Order.
[01:36:01.894 --> 01:36:03.615]  He sees it, screams, runs.
[01:36:04.135 --> 01:36:05.416]  You don't know what the machine is.
[01:36:05.476 --> 01:36:06.756]  The message is they're secret.
[01:36:06.796 --> 01:36:07.837]  They're terrorist stuff.
[01:36:08.317 --> 01:36:09.038]  They were right.
[01:36:09.058 --> 01:36:11.320]  Anybody who's involved with guns is bad.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:14.703]  I mean, the programming is everywhere.
[01:36:15.663 --> 01:36:25.972]  What I've been doing on the Police States Free is I only rewind like seven and a half minutes of it, and where you had in your America Destroyed by Design where you had a person asking Governor Bush a question, I started there.
[01:36:26.353 --> 01:36:31.337]  I tell them, rewind it, but watch this, and then they watch Building 7 come down, and I tell them that that's on there.
[01:36:31.377 --> 01:36:34.760]  That might get some interest in them, you know, because it's a long tape.
[01:36:36.114 --> 01:36:40.759]  Yeah, it's the highbrow stuff, but it's two hours and 40 minutes, moves fast.
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.844]  Road to Tyranny is the best tape for first-timers to wake them up.
[01:36:47.357 --> 01:36:52.559]  I've given that to a lot of people, and, you know, when you tell them it's the Twin Towers, they're interested.
[01:36:52.579 --> 01:37:02.303]  This tape here is just what's going on, and I tell them, well, Building 7 comes down in less than 10 seconds, and that, you know, to try to get some interest in them.
[01:37:02.363 --> 01:37:05.105]  And that building wasn't even hit by an aircraft.
[01:37:05.625 --> 01:37:10.087]  Yeah, and I tell them that, but most people are too busy in their day-to-day, and they don't care.
[01:37:11.467 --> 01:37:13.228]  Well, they're going to lose their freedom, aren't they?
[01:37:13.248 --> 01:37:13.888]  Thanks for the call.
[01:37:14.469 --> 01:37:15.269]  Keep it up, John.
[01:37:16.169 --> 01:37:19.071]  Yeah, we get calls where everybody wakes up and sees the videos.
[01:37:19.091 --> 01:37:22.474]  We get calls that nobody wakes up, where some people wake up.
[01:37:23.535 --> 01:37:27.918]  The films are having the best effect we've seen in unlocking minds.
[01:37:27.958 --> 01:37:29.359]  They are so important.
[01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:31.521]  I want to commend those that have gotten them.
[01:37:31.641 --> 01:37:37.486]  I want to commend those that have made copies for non-profit, not for sale purposes, and put them on AXIS TV.
[01:37:37.906 --> 01:37:38.546]  Keep it up.
[01:37:38.627 --> 01:37:40.068]  It's having a massive effect.
[01:37:40.628 --> 01:37:44.131]  Before I go back to Ed and others, I've made nine films.
[01:37:44.913 --> 01:37:51.597]  America Destroyed by Design, Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, all excellent.
[01:37:52.818 --> 01:37:57.802]  911, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, both those films are on September 11th and are excellent.
[01:37:58.622 --> 01:38:02.505]  We have the book, 911, Descent into Tyranny, I wrote.
[01:38:02.605 --> 01:38:03.525]  230 pages, only $12.
[01:38:05.066 --> 01:38:06.647]  The films are all over two hours.
[01:38:06.667 --> 01:38:08.228]  Some of them are two and a half hours or more.
[01:38:08.749 --> 01:38:10.170]  They're $25.95.
[01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:11.190]  Order three or more.
[01:38:11.711 --> 01:38:12.511]  They drop down to $20.00.
[01:38:14.884 --> 01:38:30.878]  And we're now carrying Paul Joseph Watson's new book, or carrying it, we printed it, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terrorism, and the New World Order covers a bunch of examples of government-sponsored terrorism to scare populations into submission.
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:37.844]  A bunch of background on the New World Order, what their current agenda is, Patriot Act II.
[01:38:37.924 --> 01:38:39.586]  It's really a powerful book, folks.
[01:38:39.606 --> 01:38:39.586]  $19.95.
[01:38:40.186 --> 01:38:42.328]  Get a second book for only $12, so $31.90 for your second book.
[01:38:42.348 --> 01:38:44.069]  We'll get two books at $31.90.
[01:38:44.129 --> 01:38:44.789]  To get one is $19.95.
[01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:48.592]  Of the Order Out of Chaos, great new book, 334 pages.
[01:38:56.830 --> 01:39:06.313]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com if you're sick and tired of taking all this and you want to wake folks up and engage the enemy at point-blank range in the Infowar.
[01:39:06.933 --> 01:39:13.195]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and join us in this historical fight by getting the films or the books.
[01:39:13.955 --> 01:39:15.816]  Or call toll-free at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:39:23.707 --> 01:39:27.689]  Again, that's 888-253-3139, or again, infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[01:39:28.469 --> 01:39:35.291]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[01:39:35.351 --> 01:39:36.192]  So it's very important.
[01:39:51.252 --> 01:39:54.214]  We've got to neutralize them now with the information war.
[01:39:54.234 --> 01:39:55.595]  We've got to do it, folks.
[01:40:22.593 --> 01:40:22.934]  Alex.
[01:40:22.974 --> 01:40:23.874]  Ed in Pennsylvania.
[01:40:23.914 --> 01:40:24.515]  Go ahead, Ed.
[01:40:24.535 --> 01:40:25.155]  You're on the air.
[01:40:26.096 --> 01:40:26.336]  Alex.
[01:40:26.977 --> 01:40:27.878]  Yes.
[01:40:28.538 --> 01:40:35.424]  You know, Sergeant Schultz on the Hogan's Heroes, I see nothing, I know nothing, you know.
[01:40:36.585 --> 01:40:39.387]  That's going to be the new thing for all the people out there, you know.
[01:40:40.528 --> 01:40:42.330]  I know nothing, nothing.
[01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:45.713]  Yeah, I see nothing, I know nothing, you know.
[01:40:47.043 --> 01:40:47.463]  Alex Jones Show!
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:33.506]  A couple months ago, I was the first person, this is a feather in my hat, that called in and said that I'd seen Jesse Ventura on the Jay Leno Show, saying that him, he never mentioned any names, but him, he was going to be vice president, his buddy's going to be president.
[01:41:34.406 --> 01:41:39.428]  And I called in a couple months ago, and like, he didn't say anything about it, because it was just kind of like,
[01:41:40.146 --> 01:41:41.708]  I never knew it was going to turn into anything like this.
[01:41:41.728 --> 01:41:42.729]  I remember you saying that.
[01:41:42.869 --> 01:41:44.731]  That's the ultimate globalist joke.
[01:41:45.352 --> 01:41:55.323]  Jesse, the former Navy CEO, at least he's an American, a professional wrestler who goes up against Arnold and the running man is one of the stalkers.
[01:41:56.806 --> 01:42:01.167]  And with a stalker on your tail, we don't lie.
[01:42:01.908 --> 01:42:04.148]  And you've got to see the movie to know what I'm talking about, folks.
[01:42:04.788 --> 01:42:11.210]  And, yeah, these two running around as our presidents, wouldn't that be a funny joke on everybody by the New World Order?
[01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:15.431]  I ran into that movie like last week and watched it at the Running Man.
[01:42:15.711 --> 01:42:18.992]  And the very beginning of it shows exactly what you're talking about.
[01:42:19.012 --> 01:42:22.613]  Yeah, the government blows stuff up, blames it on innocent people.
[01:42:23.771 --> 01:42:36.621]  A certain guy in the Army wouldn't... Arnie was the guy in the Army who wouldn't kill people, and they framed him, and they completely turned everything around on him.
[01:42:36.801 --> 01:42:38.903]  It's food riot in progress.
[01:42:39.043 --> 01:42:39.843]  Food riot, yeah.
[01:42:39.943 --> 01:42:41.725]  Eliminate everyone in sight.
[01:42:42.265 --> 01:42:43.566]  I refuse to do that.
[01:42:44.347 --> 01:42:48.170]  For the rest of my life, I'd love it, but... And the whole thing, yeah.
[01:42:48.730 --> 01:42:49.911]  So if they have these race...
[01:42:50.871 --> 01:42:54.778]  Oh, you can be assured it's going to be the Arabs first.
[01:43:05.347 --> 01:43:08.509]  And then there'll be a big crisis and they'll blame it on some little scientist.
[01:43:08.609 --> 01:43:09.269]  Oh, he did it.
[01:43:09.529 --> 01:43:13.891]  We'll have to take all your rights down to stop the people who go, yes, to stop the bio-attack.
[01:43:13.931 --> 01:43:16.053]  We've all got to take our chips and be good little servants.
[01:43:16.113 --> 01:43:21.896]  And then after a few years of being in our compact cities under martial law for our safety, someone else will hit.
[01:43:22.536 --> 01:43:25.377]  And it's going to go on and on and the elite are going to have the cure.
[01:43:25.858 --> 01:43:34.222]  I have official government plans and now it's been in the news here and there, State Department documents, Australian documents, and then...
[01:43:35.638 --> 01:43:41.461]  Then they'll pose this whole thing and pose as our saviors as they do this to us.
[01:43:41.882 --> 01:43:49.766]  Will they kill more white people that have an attitude problem than other people that don't have a sense of freedom and liberty?
[01:43:51.427 --> 01:43:54.429]  No, the globalists, I think a lot of white folks are going to be okay.
[01:43:55.269 --> 01:43:58.131]  The main extermination program is against people of color.
[01:43:59.942 --> 01:44:00.303]  Who knows?
[01:44:00.743 --> 01:44:04.206]  Well, no, we know they put the HIV virus for the Africans first.
[01:44:04.266 --> 01:44:06.188]  We know they do a lot of that.
[01:44:06.268 --> 01:44:13.774]  The Australian plan that's declassified, Sydney Morning Herald, was to kill the third world by putting stuff in food aid.
[01:44:15.435 --> 01:44:16.396]  We know what they do.
[01:44:17.337 --> 01:44:22.081]  They'll make our life better, or will they kill us and make better slaves out of other people?
[01:44:23.262 --> 01:44:25.784]  Well, they're going to kill a lot of people if they get their way.
[01:44:25.804 --> 01:44:26.945]  They're on a power trip, and
[01:44:27.771 --> 01:44:31.155]  That's why they like Arnie and Margaret Sanger and, you know, all those folks.
[01:44:32.737 --> 01:44:33.638]  You're the greatest, Alex.
[01:44:34.499 --> 01:44:36.241]  Well, thanks for the call.
[01:44:36.261 --> 01:44:36.922]  Appreciate it.
[01:44:38.664 --> 01:44:42.308]  But, of course, I mean, you know, look, I always thought Hitler was bad.
[01:44:42.328 --> 01:44:48.235]  The Simon Wiesenthal Center says Arnold's good, and Arnold's on the record supporting Nazi politicians and saying he loves Hitler, so...
[01:44:49.065 --> 01:44:51.949]  I guess I'm anti-Semitic if I don't say that I love Hitler.
[01:44:51.969 --> 01:44:53.591]  So I love Hitler.
[01:44:53.971 --> 01:44:54.832]  I love Hitler now.
[01:44:55.533 --> 01:44:58.456]  Okay, now can I get an award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center?
[01:44:58.476 --> 01:45:00.559]  Of course I don't love Hitler, but...
[01:45:01.463 --> 01:45:03.885]  No, no, I don't want to be called anti-Semitic, so maybe I should say I love him.
[01:45:04.046 --> 01:45:08.370]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:12.974]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:45:13.114 --> 01:45:17.498]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:45:17.538 --> 01:45:18.880]  The New World Order.
[01:45:20.561 --> 01:45:24.903]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:45:24.943 --> 01:45:31.887]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:45:32.007 --> 01:45:34.068]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:45:34.288 --> 01:45:44.514]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:45:45.015 --> 01:45:50.400]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:45:50.881 --> 01:45:52.422]  Visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order.
[01:45:52.442 --> 01:45:53.123]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:53.163 --> 01:45:53.343]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:45:53.363 --> 01:45:54.244]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:46:03.374 --> 01:46:05.055]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:46:05.155 --> 01:46:07.656]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:46:07.836 --> 01:46:08.516]  It feels great.
[01:46:08.716 --> 01:46:09.717]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:46:09.837 --> 01:46:15.259]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:46:15.499 --> 01:46:17.280]  I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:20.622]  I've lost 16 pounds, and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:46:20.722 --> 01:46:21.402]  Incredible.
[01:46:21.602 --> 01:46:22.823]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:46:22.843 --> 01:46:26.544]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:46:26.824 --> 01:46:30.266]  Sharon lost 28 pounds with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:46:30.686 --> 01:46:37.214]  I have arthritis and I have a thyroid problem and blood pressure and Vim and Vigor has really been a blessing to me.
[01:46:37.454 --> 01:46:43.161]  I've lost 28 pounds and counting and I thank them very much from the bottom of my heart.
[01:46:43.541 --> 01:46:48.207]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:46:48.567 --> 01:46:49.388]  Call right now.
[01:46:49.408 --> 01:46:49.808]  1-800-622-THIN.
[01:46:49.828 --> 01:46:50.469]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:46:50.489 --> 01:46:51.430]  $25 off a three-month supply.
[01:46:51.450 --> 01:46:52.371]  So call Vim and Vigor today.
[01:46:52.391 --> 01:46:52.671]  1-800-622-THIN.
[01:46:52.691 --> 01:46:53.312]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:47:05.399 --> 01:47:09.900]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:14.341]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:47:14.641 --> 01:47:15.181]  We listened.
[01:47:15.481 --> 01:47:20.462]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:47:20.742 --> 01:47:21.222]  We listened.
[01:47:21.622 --> 01:47:24.643]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:47:25.083 --> 01:47:25.603]  We listened.
[01:47:26.083 --> 01:47:29.644]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:47:29.744 --> 01:47:30.765]  We're good to go.
[01:47:56.690 --> 01:47:59.973]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:48:00.453 --> 01:48:03.156]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:48:08.702 --> 01:48:17.391]  Folks, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution is reporting, and it's on InfoWars.com right now, that, yeah, it's going to be a 20-state term.
[01:48:18.234 --> 01:48:23.615]  For the Victory Act, lots of new lies by Ashcroft that he had always said that he was going to propose.
[01:48:24.016 --> 01:48:27.817]  A second Patriot Act that he'd never said that there wasn't one.
[01:48:28.017 --> 01:48:28.357]  Oh, really?
[01:48:28.397 --> 01:48:29.677]  I just had it on videotape saying it.
[01:48:30.437 --> 01:48:33.478]  And that we must pass this or millions will die.
[01:48:34.939 --> 01:48:37.039]  And superbugs spread into community.
[01:48:38.119 --> 01:48:40.840]  Antibiotic-resistant superbugs are spreading into the community.
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.021]  Experts have warned this from the BBC.
[01:48:43.061 --> 01:48:45.041]  A lot more important than West Nile.
[01:48:45.381 --> 01:48:47.462]  Though West Nile is serious, but nothing compared to this.
[01:48:48.484 --> 01:48:54.392]  More calls on the hypocrisy of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, saying they support Arnold Schwarzenegger but not Mel Gibson.
[01:48:55.714 --> 01:48:57.758]  We're going to take a bunch of your calls in the next hour.
[01:48:57.878 --> 01:48:59.059]  We're live, folks.
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:03.626]  It is Tuesday night for the nighttime show from...
[01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:08.594]  9 to midnight Central Standard Time, the 12th of August, 2003.
[01:49:09.014 --> 01:49:18.400]  I do this show live Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, 11 to 2 Central, and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:29.347]  We go out on a growing number of wonderful AM and FM affiliates from Rhode Island to Northern California to Denver, Colorado to Austin, Texas to Albuquerque, New Mexico to Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:49:31.867 --> 01:49:34.609]  And we go out on the shortwave, the internet, the satellite.
[01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:38.572]  The shortwave frequencies during the day are 12.172 and 9320.
[01:49:38.752 --> 01:49:44.837]  And at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 6890.
[01:49:45.017 --> 01:49:49.620]  And please keep spreading the word about the show, about the websites, about what we do.
[01:49:49.961 --> 01:49:52.202]  We don't have the Rockefeller media to promote us.
[01:49:52.362 --> 01:49:53.683]  It's up to you, the grassroots.
[01:49:54.064 --> 01:49:55.084]  We do have power.
[01:49:55.124 --> 01:49:56.866]  We are effecting change together.
[01:49:57.206 --> 01:49:58.327]  So God bless you all.
[01:49:59.488 --> 01:50:05.010]  But I do have a bunch of news and a bunch of different key issues I'm going to branch out other than the Arnold story.
[01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:07.231]  We can still discuss that hypocrisy in the next hour.
[01:50:07.792 --> 01:50:10.293]  Got some lines open now for the first time this evening.
[01:50:11.153 --> 01:50:13.934]  The toll-free number to join us on air again is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:50:13.954 --> 01:50:14.194]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:50:30.245 --> 01:50:35.269]  And the websites are Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, again, just in case you missed it.
[01:50:35.309 --> 01:50:42.275]  But we will be taking your calls coming up in the next hour on any issue you'd like to discuss, any news story we haven't mentioned.
[01:50:43.937 --> 01:50:47.499]  If you disagree with me on some issue, you go to the front of the line.
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:51.303]  We've got a whole other hour coming up and just a bunch of news.
[01:50:51.343 --> 01:50:53.845]  But does it make you mad?
[01:50:53.905 --> 01:50:57.468]  You all heard Ashcroft say the Patriot Act didn't affect citizens' rights.
[01:50:58.402 --> 01:51:02.706]  Then you heard him say there wasn't a Patriot Act 2 after it was already introduced.
[01:51:02.746 --> 01:51:04.607]  I mean, just insane levels of lying.
[01:51:04.627 --> 01:51:05.968]  The news not calling him on it.
[01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:09.311]  Now saying, okay, there is a Patriot Act 2.
[01:51:09.411 --> 01:51:10.432]  It's called the Victory Act.
[01:51:10.492 --> 01:51:12.194]  I'm going to tour 20 states.
[01:51:13.054 --> 01:51:19.440]  So after the globalists blow more stuff up, they can say, see, we told you to give your rights over the bad man would get you.
[01:51:20.581 --> 01:51:21.481]  This is incredible.
[01:51:21.621 --> 01:51:24.644]  And Australia is warning that terrorists are going to hit us with bombs.
[01:51:25.257 --> 01:51:28.978]  Bio-weapons and race-specific weapons any minute, yeah, when they're part of it.
[01:51:28.998 --> 01:51:36.160]  You've got all these microbiologists involved in race-specific weapons, dying mysteriously and being murdered and committing suicide.
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:42.542]  I mean, there's a lot of really scary stuff going on, a lot more important than Colby Bryant or Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:51:42.562 --> 01:51:51.745]  We're forced to address these diversions just because they become educational and the destruction is so huge it must be responded to.
[01:51:53.982 --> 01:51:54.742]  Think about it.
[01:51:55.182 --> 01:52:00.864]  They're going after somebody who makes a film word for word out of the Bible written by Jews.
[01:52:02.165 --> 01:52:03.105]  Not anti-Semitic.
[01:52:03.525 --> 01:52:04.926]  They're wanting to ban the Bible, folks.
[01:52:04.946 --> 01:52:06.046]  There's discussions in Europe.
[01:52:06.506 --> 01:52:07.887]  The ADL goes after them.
[01:52:07.927 --> 01:52:09.027]  Simon Wiesenthal goes after.
[01:52:09.247 --> 01:52:11.368]  And then Simon Wiesenthal says Hitler's a great guy.
[01:52:11.968 --> 01:52:12.528]  Excuse me.
[01:52:12.929 --> 01:52:13.389]  Excuse me.
[01:52:13.469 --> 01:52:14.329]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:52:14.349 --> 01:52:15.349]  They didn't say Hitler's a great guy.
[01:52:15.369 --> 01:52:16.850]  They said Arnold Schwarzenegger's a great guy.
[01:52:17.210 --> 01:52:19.951]  And Arnold Schwarzenegger says that Hitler is a great guy.
[01:52:21.318 --> 01:52:22.739]  And hangs out with all these Nazis.
[01:52:22.779 --> 01:52:24.121]  I mean, I'm sick of it!
[01:52:24.501 --> 01:52:28.905]  I'm sick of good people being labeled and then real Nazis left alone in worship.
[01:52:30.426 --> 01:52:33.028]  Of course, Arnold's five million has something to do with that, the donation.
[01:52:35.690 --> 01:52:39.494]  All right, third hour, just about 70-something seconds away.
[01:52:40.394 --> 01:52:41.355]  We'll take your calls.
[01:52:41.876 --> 01:52:42.456]  We're live.
[01:52:42.476 --> 01:52:43.777]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:52:43.797 --> 01:52:44.498]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:44.578 --> 01:52:45.318]  Stay the course.
[01:52:54.312 --> 01:52:56.274]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:52:56.354 --> 01:53:05.143]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 fluoride and arsenic reduction elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Lights Berkey.
[01:53:08.867 --> 01:53:12.050]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:20.280]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.941 --> 01:53:22.021]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.701 --> 01:53:23.842]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.462 --> 01:53:25.282]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.063 --> 01:53:26.963]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.983 --> 01:53:31.245]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.805 --> 01:53:35.927]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:36.127 --> 01:53:41.189]  All right, my friends.
[01:53:41.349 --> 01:53:48.892]  Welcome back to another live edition, no, another live hour, of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:49.861 --> 01:53:54.263]  And I know that we've got Tom, and who's up after Tom there?
[01:53:56.064 --> 01:53:56.605]  Dan?
[01:53:57.785 --> 01:53:58.045]  Ann!
[01:53:58.345 --> 01:53:58.886]  Oh, okay.
[01:53:58.926 --> 01:54:00.006]  I'm not good with callers, folks.
[01:54:00.046 --> 01:54:01.267]  I think you've all noticed this.
[01:54:01.307 --> 01:54:02.367]  And then who else?
[01:54:03.448 --> 01:54:06.890]  Russ and Ed and many, many others.
[01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:11.212]  So a lot of calls in this hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:11.492 --> 01:54:14.454]  For those that don't know, every show is a remote for me.
[01:54:14.474 --> 01:54:16.995]  Because I'm down in Austin, Texas.
[01:54:17.994 --> 01:54:18.654]  We're good to go.
[01:54:18.674 --> 01:54:19.575]  We're good to go.
[01:54:38.148 --> 01:54:45.172]  So they tell me the callers during the breaks, and I write them so fast, I then can't read my own writing, and I have to ask them, what does that say?
[01:54:45.692 --> 01:54:46.633]  What's that again?
[01:54:46.833 --> 01:54:47.213]  All right.
[01:54:47.934 --> 01:54:52.076]  All that aside, I've got to get my third wind going here.
[01:54:52.096 --> 01:54:53.477]  We're already into the third hour.
[01:54:53.497 --> 01:54:55.218]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:54:55.258 --> 01:54:55.998]  Here's some of the news.
[01:54:56.098 --> 01:54:58.480]  Superbugs spread into community.
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:02.342]  BBC, California rabbi calls passion.
[01:55:03.687 --> 01:55:05.188]  Already fueling hatred.
[01:55:05.529 --> 01:55:15.176]  We'll talk about the hypocrisy in that statement because the same Simon Wiesenthal Center is certifying Arnold as a good guy when Arnold's on tape saying he loves Hitler.
[01:55:16.917 --> 01:55:19.719]  And, by the way, hanging out with Kirk Valtime to this day.
[01:55:21.241 --> 01:55:22.582]  Again, I'm going to recap that later.
[01:55:22.602 --> 01:55:24.043]  I already talked about it in the last hour.
[01:55:25.184 --> 01:55:30.648]  Also, we're going to get into British soldiers face wrath of Iraqis as hatred festers on streets of Basra.
[01:55:31.874 --> 01:55:34.375]  Explosions earlier this week, killing more U.S.
[01:55:34.476 --> 01:55:36.897]  soldiers, just terrible things happening.
[01:55:37.617 --> 01:55:39.678]  And we have this article here out of Bloomberg.
[01:55:39.698 --> 01:55:45.481]  Australia's spy agency warns of biological chemical attacks, says they're imminent.
[01:55:46.261 --> 01:55:53.765]  I'm sure you've already heard the Postal Service is going to put RFIDs in all their stamps and track and trace you and keep a record of where you mail stuff.
[01:55:55.462 --> 01:55:59.644]  And this is big government to the rescue because corporations tried to push this on us.
[01:55:59.684 --> 01:56:01.664]  People said no to the tiny trackable chips.
[01:56:02.445 --> 01:56:08.207]  And so now, government's coming in trying to force the change in the industry.
[01:56:08.287 --> 01:56:08.807]  And guess what?
[01:56:08.847 --> 01:56:21.612]  A month ago, we broke the story on this show with Catherine Albrecht, a PhD from Harvard, when they got the documents of Walmart and others meeting with Homeland Security trying to force this on you as a mode of control.
[01:56:21.772 --> 01:56:23.813]  So it's part of the record, folks.
[01:56:24.710 --> 01:56:29.492]  And that transcript is at prisonplanet.com, and in the section it says Alex Jones.
[01:56:29.532 --> 01:56:34.595]  It's a transcript of that interview, groundbreaking stuff, so definitely go check that out.
[01:56:35.535 --> 01:56:38.137]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:56:38.917 --> 01:56:40.898]  Tom in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:56:40.978 --> 01:56:41.358]  Welcome.
[01:56:41.919 --> 01:56:42.719]  Good evening, Alex.
[01:56:43.359 --> 01:56:43.720]  Welcome.
[01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:46.501]  I have a first-time caller, long-time listener.
[01:56:47.193 --> 01:56:51.757]  I've been involved in this going on since the mid-80s.
[01:56:52.037 --> 01:57:00.504]  I wanted to thank you, first of all, for earlier telling a caller that the 9-11 video is a good entry to get people to wake up.
[01:57:02.145 --> 01:57:14.576]  I hope you mention that more because I run into folks and friends of mine and acquaintances of mine who have made copies of the videos and we try to distribute them to people and been trying to get out there.
[01:57:14.736 --> 01:57:16.117]  We've been doing this for years, but
[01:57:17.339 --> 01:57:28.248]  Your stuff is just powerful because it's all documented and that's what's really solid and we really appreciate because it's hard to get somebody to understand what you're saying unless you've got the proof to back it up.
[01:57:29.769 --> 01:57:46.282]  On the other hand, a suggestion that I have for everybody who is frustrated with people who they give videos to or give materials to and that suggestion is you've got to feed them a little bit at a time.
[01:57:47.006 --> 01:57:47.806]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:57:47.826 --> 01:57:48.687]  This is important.
[01:57:49.187 --> 01:57:52.448]  We're talking about how to unlock minds, get people out of the matrix.
[01:57:53.088 --> 01:57:54.449]  We'll discuss it on the other side.
[01:57:55.449 --> 01:57:59.670]  And then we'll also get into how I am disgusted with the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[01:58:01.451 --> 01:58:05.132]  Because they are endorsing Arnold Schwarzenegger, saying he's a great guy.
[01:58:05.973 --> 01:58:12.455]  When Arnold, as early as just a few months ago, there's photos of him with Kurt Voltheim, who is an admitted Nazi.
[01:58:12.635 --> 01:58:12.695]  And...
[01:58:15.111 --> 01:58:21.958]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:58:22.279 --> 01:58:23.660]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:26.043]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:58:26.063 --> 01:58:28.305]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:58:28.565 --> 01:58:33.510]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:58:33.851 --> 01:58:37.875]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:58:38.115 --> 01:58:38.696]  We're good to go.
[01:58:53.012 --> 01:58:56.713]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today and man the guns of the Infowars.
[01:58:56.833 --> 01:58:58.394]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:58:58.414 --> 01:58:58.794]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:58:58.814 --> 01:59:01.215]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:59:01.235 --> 01:59:02.495]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[01:59:15.768 --> 01:59:21.690]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:59:21.930 --> 01:59:24.171]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:59:24.371 --> 01:59:30.733]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:59:31.073 --> 01:59:31.714]  We're good to go.
[01:59:51.311 --> 01:59:56.935]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:00:20.271 --> 02:00:27.760]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:35.248]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:00:35.508 --> 02:00:39.713]  Potassium iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[02:00:39.853 --> 02:00:40.434]  We're good to go.
[02:01:03.673 --> 02:01:04.714]  Call toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:01:04.754 --> 02:01:06.054]  Call now and get free shipping.
[02:01:06.074 --> 02:01:06.515]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:01:06.595 --> 02:01:07.055]  Big Brother.
[02:01:07.075 --> 02:01:08.035]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:08.075 --> 02:01:08.756]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:08.796 --> 02:01:09.716]  You want answers?
[02:01:09.736 --> 02:01:10.316]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:27.626 --> 02:01:31.527]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:31.807 --> 02:01:35.909]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:36.129 --> 02:01:50.634]  I don't care if you're Chinese, or Russian, or Jewish, or German, or English, or Welsh, or Eskimo, or Mexican.
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:57.623]  If you try to take my liberties or freedoms, if you aid the New World Order, if you're engaged in corruption, I will expose you.
[02:01:58.764 --> 02:01:59.864]  That's what this show's about.
[02:02:00.124 --> 02:02:01.445]  It's about defending my family.
[02:02:01.985 --> 02:02:03.826]  The process we end up defending your family.
[02:02:04.326 --> 02:02:09.229]  Because we're in this country, we're losing our freedoms, we're losing the platform that we live on.
[02:02:10.309 --> 02:02:11.510]  And it makes me very angry.
[02:02:12.381 --> 02:02:14.523]  All right, I've mentioned a bunch of the news that is coming up.
[02:02:15.284 --> 02:02:16.645]  New major superbugs.
[02:02:16.725 --> 02:02:18.526]  The government's saying brace for massive attacks.
[02:02:18.827 --> 02:02:19.207]  Yeah.
[02:02:19.828 --> 02:02:22.490]  Oh, when the terrorists say they're about to attack us, I listen.
[02:02:23.351 --> 02:02:25.933]  You know, you better give your rights up or bad men are going to get you.
[02:02:25.993 --> 02:02:27.835]  That's the terrorists right there, folks.
[02:02:29.536 --> 02:02:30.757]  The terrorist handlers.
[02:02:30.977 --> 02:02:31.878]  So it's all coming up.
[02:02:32.379 --> 02:02:37.303]  I want to just go through some calls real fast here on any issue you want to raise, and I'm going to dive into news.
[02:02:38.312 --> 02:02:47.824]  Let's go back to Tom in Ohio, who was mentioning my films and saying that Road to Tyranny is the best video to start with to wake folks up.
[02:02:47.844 --> 02:02:48.985]  Go ahead and finish up, Tom.
[02:02:49.005 --> 02:02:56.074]  Yes, I'm very happy that you mentioned that, Eric, to the earlier caller, that you felt that that was a good entry-level video, and I would definitely agree.
[02:02:56.855 --> 02:03:11.791]  One thing I found and one thing being friends of mine found for years doing gun show tables and trying to educate people because that's the crowd you can really get into and make a lot of allies is you have to spoon feed a lot of people.
[02:03:12.958 --> 02:03:13.999]  That's first and foremost.
[02:03:14.039 --> 02:03:17.120]  You can't overwhelm them with information all at one time.
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:22.721]  Yeah, most conservatives I talk to still don't know that Bush has said he'll sign the assault weapons ban.
[02:03:22.942 --> 02:03:23.202]  Right.
[02:03:23.422 --> 02:03:28.423]  They still don't know that Bush is for open borders wanting blanket total amnesty.
[02:03:28.844 --> 02:03:33.785]  They still don't know that he's blocking Dan Burton's committee protecting Bill Clinton.
[02:03:34.085 --> 02:03:40.668]  They still don't know that Arnold is pro-abortion, anti-gun, pro-homosexuals adopting children.
[02:03:41.208 --> 02:03:41.828]  And likes Hitler.
[02:03:42.697 --> 02:03:43.317]  Don't forget that one.
[02:03:43.337 --> 02:03:53.241]  He said in Pumping Iron, and now they've got a new edited version that doesn't, but MSNBC reports, and I remember seeing him decades ago watching and saying, I admire Adolf Hitler.
[02:03:54.141 --> 02:04:01.403]  But again, at his wedding, he thanked Burt Waldheim right when all that was coming out, when he was German, excuse me, Austrian president.
[02:04:01.703 --> 02:04:02.744]  He'd just gotten out of the U.N.,
[02:04:03.864 --> 02:04:05.425]  He said, I don't care about this.
[02:04:05.465 --> 02:04:06.186]  I got the quote here.
[02:04:06.246 --> 02:04:08.047]  I don't care about this Nazi stuff.
[02:04:08.627 --> 02:04:09.308]  I love him.
[02:04:09.368 --> 02:04:10.508]  Maria loves him.
[02:04:10.889 --> 02:04:13.070]  And then there's a photo of him last year with him.
[02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:15.952]  And then, again, his dad was a Nazi police chief.
[02:04:16.312 --> 02:04:26.078]  And then on top of that, when his dad died, his mother married the head of the Austrian parliament, who was another top Nazi.
[02:04:26.579 --> 02:04:28.580]  So, I mean, it's just wall to wall.
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:40.671]  One suggestion I would like to make for those of us out there who get frustrated when you try to get information out to people and they either don't want to wake up or they're overwhelmed by it or what have you.
[02:04:41.251 --> 02:04:44.254]  I hate to use this terminology, but it's psychological warfare.
[02:04:44.635 --> 02:04:46.797]  As I said, I hate to use that terminology.
[02:04:47.257 --> 02:04:52.542]  The one thing you can use to get people thinking is the Kennedy assassination.
[02:04:53.126 --> 02:04:59.831]  Because there aren't too many people that I know that I've met in my lifetime that have believed that Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone shooter in Dallas, Texas.
[02:05:00.972 --> 02:05:09.219]  When you tell people, say, do you believe that Oswald was the lone gunman, 9 out of 10 will tell you no.
[02:05:09.719 --> 02:05:13.722]  And then you come back with, well, there had to be a conspiracy then, didn't there?
[02:05:13.742 --> 02:05:16.625]  The government covered that up.
[02:05:16.885 --> 02:05:20.668]  And another way to start is, you hear about the black men in Tuskegee.
[02:05:21.303 --> 02:05:21.523]  Yeah.
[02:05:21.583 --> 02:05:24.044]  Letting them die of a sentence over 50 years.
[02:05:24.624 --> 02:05:27.226]  Well, you heard about how they spread our troops on purpose, didn't you?
[02:05:27.286 --> 02:05:27.546]  Yeah.
[02:05:27.566 --> 02:05:28.926]  You heard about biological testing?
[02:05:28.966 --> 02:05:30.287]  Yeah.
[02:05:30.367 --> 02:05:33.328]  You heard about how they brought Nazis into the country?
[02:05:33.368 --> 02:05:33.769]  Yeah.
[02:05:34.609 --> 02:05:35.749]  On and on and on.
[02:05:35.789 --> 02:05:37.210]  Well, then why do you trust these people?
[02:05:37.250 --> 02:05:40.031]  Why do you give them total power and total secrecy?
[02:05:40.391 --> 02:05:42.452]  I mean, folks, it's so obvious.
[02:05:42.913 --> 02:05:48.335]  You have to use their own suspicions and their own thoughts of what they know to be true.
[02:05:49.423 --> 02:05:53.947]  To open them up to other avenues that there are conspiracies that do exist.
[02:05:53.987 --> 02:05:55.227]  Programs of slavery.
[02:05:55.308 --> 02:05:56.949]  And, you know, this is life or death, Tom.
[02:05:57.329 --> 02:05:57.549]  Yes.
[02:05:58.450 --> 02:05:59.271]  It is life or death.
[02:05:59.291 --> 02:06:00.431]  And they have to understand that.
[02:06:00.451 --> 02:06:00.952]  And I found...
[02:06:01.451 --> 02:06:12.756]  That the Kennedy assassination thing is probably the best one because you get 9 out of 10 people you ask that question to and they're going to tell you there's no way that they believe the Warren Commission and Oswald was a lone gunman.
[02:06:13.057 --> 02:06:26.583]  And then you just come back with, well, hey, if you don't believe that he could do that and you believe there was a conspiracy, why can't you believe that these government orchestrated Oklahoma City, 9-11, etc.?
[02:06:26.663 --> 02:06:28.464]  But we have the official U.S.
[02:06:28.504 --> 02:06:29.925]  government document calling for 9-1-1.
[02:06:31.744 --> 02:06:33.466]  We have them planning the attack.
[02:06:33.566 --> 02:06:37.210]  ABC News Baltimore Sun reported two months before 9-1-1.
[02:06:37.871 --> 02:06:41.936]  Again, revelation of the method.
[02:06:42.016 --> 02:06:46.261]  Revelation of the hierarchy is they can mass condition us, and they're doing it again.
[02:06:46.281 --> 02:06:51.447]  And a big tool that has helped us was the release and the de-hospitation of Northwoods.
[02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:57.902]  And I want to thank you very much for making that available to a lot of people who did not know that that existed.
[02:06:58.342 --> 02:06:59.762]  And that has opened up some eyes, too.
[02:06:59.923 --> 02:07:01.543]  Well, thank you, Tom, for all you're doing.
[02:07:01.563 --> 02:07:02.043]  You keep it up.
[02:07:02.083 --> 02:07:02.383]  God bless you.
[02:07:02.403 --> 02:07:02.744]  Thank you, too.
[02:07:02.764 --> 02:07:03.124]  Thank you.
[02:07:03.244 --> 02:07:04.024]  Good to hear from you.
[02:07:04.604 --> 02:07:05.725]  Ann, where are you calling us from?
[02:07:06.545 --> 02:07:07.485]  Hello?
[02:07:07.525 --> 02:07:08.626]  Yes, Ann, where are you calling from?
[02:07:08.786 --> 02:07:11.186]  Oh, Mr. Jones, I just went from New Mexico.
[02:07:11.386 --> 02:07:11.767]  Welcome.
[02:07:12.407 --> 02:07:12.867]  Thank you.
[02:07:13.147 --> 02:07:15.668]  And I just want to commend you for what you're doing.
[02:07:16.437 --> 02:07:19.459]  Because that's what's going down, you know.
[02:07:19.700 --> 02:07:24.463]  And they're promoting Mr. Schwarzenegger because he fits the spirit of the age.
[02:07:25.464 --> 02:07:27.105]  I believe that's what's happening there.
[02:07:27.125 --> 02:07:27.606]  That's it.
[02:07:27.626 --> 02:07:28.046]  That's it.
[02:07:28.086 --> 02:07:29.567]  I've been wanting to say that all night.
[02:07:29.867 --> 02:07:34.831]  He is a perfect Luciferian beehive resident.
[02:07:35.272 --> 02:07:43.278]  He is this fake, plastic, wicked, narcissistic, Bohemian Grove, phony neocon.
[02:07:44.208 --> 02:07:47.511]  And you see the neocons on the news going, so what if he's liberal?
[02:07:47.571 --> 02:07:48.391]  He's great.
[02:07:49.312 --> 02:07:50.493]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:07:50.893 --> 02:07:57.918]  And then you contrast that with the truth that Mel Gibson is trying to put out in his movie, The Passion.
[02:07:59.139 --> 02:08:05.184]  And then there's all of these people, ADL and all the groups that are, again, controlling...
[02:08:05.959 --> 02:08:08.684]  The masses by saying, no, you don't want to go see this.
[02:08:08.724 --> 02:08:10.407]  We don't want you to watch this.
[02:08:10.427 --> 02:08:11.769]  Oh, we're going to boycott theaters.
[02:08:11.829 --> 02:08:13.352]  We're not going to allow it to show in theaters.
[02:08:13.372 --> 02:08:14.354]  And understand.
[02:08:16.195 --> 02:08:18.677]  The film has been reviewed by Christian groups and others.
[02:08:18.777 --> 02:08:22.879]  It is word for word out of the King James Bible.
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:29.943]  They took the King James Bible, translated it back into Greek, Aramaic, and then brought it out.
[02:08:30.564 --> 02:08:33.466]  I mean, it's the same stuff that's in King of Kings, just in Aramaic.
[02:08:33.966 --> 02:08:38.669]  And I hope they used Yahweh's name because that is the name of the creator of the universe and his son.
[02:08:40.894 --> 02:08:47.397]  What's incredible is that, I want people to understand, the same head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, I have the article, I'm going to read it before the show ends.
[02:08:47.918 --> 02:08:51.620]  I want the power of this to pierce people's minds.
[02:08:53.081 --> 02:09:02.146]  I've stood up for Israel, I've stood up for Jews, and they don't represent most Jews, and, you know, this is sick.
[02:09:03.026 --> 02:09:07.289]  Arnold Schwarzenegger on national TV said, I admire Hitler.
[02:09:07.927 --> 02:09:24.658]  The guy vacations and hangs out with Kirk Valtime, helped get him elected in 86, hangs out with him, photos of him last year with him, says I love him in the middle of the controversy in 86 at his wedding when they opened the present from Valtime.
[02:09:25.499 --> 02:09:26.119]  All of this.
[02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:34.525]  And they say, hold on, the same head of Simon Wiesenthal says Arnold's a great guy, and he's for abortion, all this stuff.
[02:09:34.745 --> 02:09:37.647]  And then over here you have Mel Gibson makes a movie with his own money,
[02:09:38.499 --> 02:09:42.482]  About Christ, right out of the Bible, and that's bad.
[02:09:42.742 --> 02:09:43.803]  Go ahead.
[02:09:44.063 --> 02:09:49.507]  And it's because Mr. Schwarzenegger is mirroring what the controllers want to do, and that's a program.
[02:09:49.947 --> 02:09:50.407]  Well, that's it.
[02:09:50.427 --> 02:09:51.988]  It's not about Jews or Germans.
[02:09:52.008 --> 02:09:53.009]  That's all mid-level.
[02:09:53.209 --> 02:09:54.210]  It's all about control.
[02:09:54.370 --> 02:10:00.975]  Yeah, at the top, it's a bunch of globalist devils who want to demonize anything wholesome.
[02:10:01.015 --> 02:10:01.375]  Right.
[02:10:03.036 --> 02:10:03.456]  Are you there?
[02:10:03.496 --> 02:10:04.297]  Your phone's fading out.
[02:10:04.921 --> 02:10:05.241]  Pardon?
[02:10:05.582 --> 02:10:06.462]  Your phone was fading out.
[02:10:06.502 --> 02:10:06.842]  Go ahead.
[02:10:06.982 --> 02:10:15.348]  Oh, I was saying, read the book of Revelation, and that's where we can find out what's really happening, the truth of what's really happening.
[02:10:15.448 --> 02:10:17.970]  Well, what's incredible is Jesus Christ was a Jew.
[02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.670]  Yes.
[02:10:19.071 --> 02:10:24.674]  And Jesus Christ pointed to the establishment, the corrupt government, and said, you are corrupt and bad.
[02:10:25.255 --> 02:10:26.536]  Now, that's not anti-Semitic.
[02:10:26.976 --> 02:10:30.118]  But the government doesn't want the Bible being taught, so they say that.
[02:10:30.798 --> 02:10:32.880]  And I want people to understand something here, folks.
[02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:36.642]  There's a move in Europe to ban teaching the Old and New Testament.
[02:10:37.022 --> 02:10:46.187]  Pennsylvania's passed a law by the Republican governor last year that preachers can be arrested if they read from the Old Testament saying it's, quote, homophobic.
[02:10:46.807 --> 02:10:51.670]  Since when, even if it was homophobic, it would still be the First Amendment.
[02:10:51.710 --> 02:10:53.851]  This country is disappearing.
[02:10:53.931 --> 02:10:57.493]  It's turning into a Nazi Russian state.
[02:10:57.813 --> 02:11:00.915]  And that's why they're promoting Mr. Schwarzenegger.
[02:11:01.375 --> 02:11:02.516]  Because he's the perfect...
[02:11:03.413 --> 02:11:04.273]  You know, image.
[02:11:04.313 --> 02:11:08.995]  He'll fit the image of what it is that they're trying to promote, which is control.
[02:11:09.335 --> 02:11:09.775]  That's it.
[02:11:09.835 --> 02:11:10.515]  A wicked devil.
[02:11:10.535 --> 02:11:11.056]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:11.076 --> 02:11:12.216]  Well, again, we bless you for your work.
[02:11:12.236 --> 02:11:13.756]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:11:13.957 --> 02:11:17.378]  I just, I mean, you know, it's not like Arnold's going to even run anything.
[02:11:17.418 --> 02:11:19.398]  It just shows what they try to push on us.
[02:11:19.478 --> 02:11:21.799]  I mean, I don't support Gray Davis.
[02:11:21.859 --> 02:11:23.320]  I mean, he's horrible.
[02:11:23.380 --> 02:11:26.781]  But they're replacing him with something, frankly, worse, folks.
[02:11:27.781 --> 02:11:32.363]  Let's go ahead and talk to Russ in West Virginia.
[02:11:32.403 --> 02:11:32.923]  Go ahead, Russ.
[02:11:33.630 --> 02:11:37.551]  Well, you know, we're getting what we deserve.
[02:11:38.091 --> 02:11:40.452]  Did you see USA Today's front-line paper?
[02:11:41.833 --> 02:11:43.233]  Oh, yeah, I have seen it today.
[02:11:44.493 --> 02:11:46.374]  I'm talking about the cameras in the schools.
[02:11:47.074 --> 02:11:51.035]  Well, they've already announced all schools federally funded to get cameras.
[02:11:51.075 --> 02:11:53.116]  They put them in the dressing rooms of 10-year-olds.
[02:11:53.776 --> 02:11:55.937]  That's Associated Press.
[02:11:56.177 --> 02:12:03.199]  Well, the point I'm getting at here is the people there in Mississippi ought to be up in arms over this, and that's why I think we've lost this
[02:12:03.956 --> 02:12:05.037]  There's just too many people.
[02:12:05.137 --> 02:12:07.079]  I don't blame those that are doing these things.
[02:12:07.619 --> 02:12:08.940]  I blame the general public.
[02:12:10.061 --> 02:12:12.563]  I blame a lot of the Christians with their peaceful attitude.
[02:12:13.724 --> 02:12:17.628]  These people need to go down to that school, rip those damn things out of there.
[02:12:19.249 --> 02:12:21.451]  They don't take their children out of the school, period.
[02:12:21.471 --> 02:12:23.833]  Well, yes, but most of them can't do that.
[02:12:23.853 --> 02:12:24.834]  Let's be realistic.
[02:12:28.016 --> 02:12:29.417]  So they can break the family up.
[02:12:29.717 --> 02:12:31.078]  Official UNESCO document.
[02:12:31.098 --> 02:12:38.543]  But none of this would happen or work if the general public that thought like you, thought like me, thought like the rest of the Christians...
[02:12:39.156 --> 02:12:42.679]  If they thought that way, why don't they stand behind and go down here and break their heads?
[02:12:42.699 --> 02:12:55.191]  Because you've got phony neocons like Schwarzenegger and Hannity and Limbaugh who themselves are the un-American socialists in bed with the Ted Kennedys playing this little Ponzi scheme right in front of us.
[02:12:56.471 --> 02:13:01.133]  Because they think abortion and open borders and gun confiscation is conservative.
[02:13:01.373 --> 02:13:03.154]  And they think cameras are conservative.
[02:13:03.334 --> 02:13:05.995]  And they think Nazis are friends of Jews.
[02:13:06.215 --> 02:13:09.536]  And those that stand up against Nazis aren't the friends of Jews.
[02:13:09.896 --> 02:13:12.277]  That's the new messed up America.
[02:13:12.297 --> 02:13:12.917]  Stay there, Russ.
[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:22.065]  As a listener to the Genesis Communications Network, you're aware of the many health dangers that have been unleashed upon an unsuspecting public.
[02:13:22.506 --> 02:13:29.651]  We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but how do we do that without costly pharmaceutical products that trade benefits with side effects?
[02:13:30.111 --> 02:13:33.914]  Stabilized oxygen may be just the answer to this question and more.
[02:13:34.294 --> 02:13:41.680]  Stabilized oxygen is an oxidant similar to food-grade hydrogen peroxide, but it is more stable and effective with no unpleasant taste.
[02:13:42.100 --> 02:13:51.372]  By providing your bloodstream with molecular oxygen, it is possible to kill anaerobic bacteria and other parasites on contact without harming tissue or friendly bacteria.
[02:13:51.832 --> 02:13:55.376]  A 120 day supply of stabilized oxygen is just $15 post-pay.
[02:13:57.205 --> 02:14:07.113]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your four-month supply and get the best oxygen boost available in easy-to-take droplet form.
[02:14:07.514 --> 02:14:09.015]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at CliffScott.com.
[02:14:14.338 --> 02:14:18.179]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:25.402]  Use a Declaration of Independence, a Constitution, and a Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.
[02:14:25.682 --> 02:14:27.183]  Take control of your own destiny.
[02:14:27.363 --> 02:14:31.864]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[02:14:32.004 --> 02:14:33.285]  This is more than a handbook.
[02:14:33.485 --> 02:14:36.786]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[02:14:37.186 --> 02:14:37.887]  Here's the deal.
[02:14:38.127 --> 02:14:49.377]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend, and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[02:14:49.617 --> 02:14:55.542]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918 and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[02:14:56.983 --> 02:15:01.809]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[02:15:02.129 --> 02:15:06.014]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:15:06.394 --> 02:15:08.236]  Ask for the Freedom Handbook Special.
[02:15:08.617 --> 02:15:09.938]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:15:09.958 --> 02:15:10.138]  Thank you.
[02:15:13.462 --> 02:15:20.967]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:15:21.247 --> 02:15:32.155]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:15:32.415 --> 02:15:34.237]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:15:34.517 --> 02:15:37.819]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:48.628]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:15:48.928 --> 02:15:49.409]  That's right.
[02:15:49.609 --> 02:15:56.715]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:15:57.015 --> 02:16:00.998]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter.
[02:16:01.278 --> 02:16:08.524]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:16:08.664 --> 02:16:11.045]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:16:11.286 --> 02:16:15.969]  I've lost 10 pounds with the collagen aid so far.
[02:16:16.169 --> 02:16:16.870]  Give it a try.
[02:16:17.070 --> 02:16:17.831]  Worked good for me.
[02:16:18.051 --> 02:16:21.413]  I'm going to have to go get re-measured because my pants are getting kind of baggy on me.
[02:16:21.573 --> 02:16:23.014]  My stomach is not there no more.
[02:16:23.114 --> 02:16:24.055]  It's really very easy.
[02:16:24.255 --> 02:16:26.797]  Helps me sleep good, lose weight, tones me up.
[02:16:27.117 --> 02:16:27.698]  Hey, I like it.
[02:16:27.938 --> 02:16:28.638]  We're good to go.
[02:16:28.678 --> 02:16:29.399]  We're good to go.
[02:16:47.105 --> 02:16:49.147]  And I've lost nine inches off my waist.
[02:16:49.427 --> 02:16:50.347]  What are you waiting for?
[02:16:50.627 --> 02:16:56.391]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, which means a leaner, healthier you.
[02:16:56.531 --> 02:16:57.972]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:16:57.992 --> 02:16:58.392]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:16:58.472 --> 02:17:00.473]  And get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.
[02:17:00.493 --> 02:17:03.035]  Lose fat the safe and healthy way with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[02:17:03.075 --> 02:17:03.535]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:17:19.614 --> 02:17:20.234]  All right, folks.
[02:17:20.334 --> 02:17:21.735]  Alex Jones here back live.
[02:17:21.775 --> 02:17:29.040]  I'm going to take two more calls from Russ and Brian, and then that's it.
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:31.801]  I'm going to come back in the last 26 minutes of the show.
[02:17:31.842 --> 02:17:36.044]  I'm going to cover some of the news we haven't gotten to yet, so stay with us a bunch of it.
[02:17:36.064 --> 02:17:36.825]  It's very important.
[02:17:37.365 --> 02:17:38.546]  Lots of news and information.
[02:17:39.266 --> 02:17:42.848]  Russ in West Virginia, go ahead and finish up, sir.
[02:17:43.289 --> 02:17:43.569]  Well...
[02:17:44.198 --> 02:18:00.228]  You know, back in Nazi Germany days, and I said this more than once over the air, I'm not a pacifist, but back then in those days, had those stormtroopers or those Gestapo never came out from behind the corners when they followed somebody around, they wouldn't have been where they're at today.
[02:18:00.829 --> 02:18:03.430]  And I see enough but a bunch of cowards here in my country.
[02:18:03.771 --> 02:18:04.651]  They won't even talk.
[02:18:04.871 --> 02:18:09.534]  I'm a distributor for the spotlight, yeah, for the American Free Press.
[02:18:09.935 --> 02:18:11.155]  I got people shy away from it.
[02:18:11.175 --> 02:18:11.916]  They don't want to look at it.
[02:18:11.956 --> 02:18:13.657]  They look around to see who the hell's watching first.
[02:18:14.614 --> 02:18:15.435]  It's over.
[02:18:15.495 --> 02:18:18.717]  I'm not a defeatist, but I'll tell you what, I'm damn disgusted.
[02:18:19.317 --> 02:18:22.760]  I just don't think there's a chance until we start breaking ahead.
[02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:27.543]  Now, if you say that you don't support Nazi Germany, that's anti-Semitic now.
[02:18:27.563 --> 02:18:28.524]  I don't care what it is.
[02:18:28.624 --> 02:18:30.065]  I don't support Israel either.
[02:18:32.126 --> 02:18:37.549]  It is good, according to the major so-called Jewish groups, to be against them is bad now.
[02:18:38.570 --> 02:18:43.172]  Mel Gibson has said he's against Nazis, he's a Christian, he's making a film out of the Bible.
[02:18:43.892 --> 02:18:44.633]  He's bad.
[02:18:45.033 --> 02:18:48.334]  Arnold Schwarzenegger says publicly, I like Kurt Walton, I like Hitler.
[02:18:48.754 --> 02:18:51.076]  He is a friend, and very good, they say.
[02:18:51.896 --> 02:18:54.937]  Folks, I'm not even being sarcastic anymore.
[02:18:54.957 --> 02:18:55.838]  This is so crazy.
[02:18:57.375 --> 02:18:58.796]  Well, all right, I'm going to let you go.
[02:18:58.856 --> 02:19:00.696]  Hey, that's a really good point you made, though.
[02:19:00.716 --> 02:19:04.337]  You say that you give people the newspaper and they look around?
[02:19:04.718 --> 02:19:13.721]  Oh, yeah, I had one guy, I gave it to a friend to give to, one of the fairs down here in West Virginia, and he backed away, get that thing away from me, get that thing away from me.
[02:19:14.141 --> 02:19:16.982]  And he took it before, but the paranoia's here.
[02:19:17.362 --> 02:19:23.184]  See, don't they know that acting like cowards, being groveling worms, brings the wolves on?
[02:19:24.238 --> 02:19:24.959]  They don't think so.
[02:19:24.999 --> 02:19:26.199]  They're not involved in it yet.
[02:19:26.239 --> 02:19:27.280]  It's going to have to hit them.
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:30.082]  If they get their act scored, it's going to be a loss.
[02:19:30.122 --> 02:19:34.945]  I think groveling and being a worm makes enemies nice to you.
[02:19:35.005 --> 02:19:38.207]  No, that's the surest way to be aggressed against you idiots.
[02:19:39.139 --> 02:19:39.819]  I'm going to drop off.
[02:19:39.879 --> 02:19:40.880]  I know you've got other callers.
[02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:41.480]  Thank you.
[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:42.100]  Thank you.
[02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:43.301]  You know, that is so important.
[02:19:43.321 --> 02:19:44.321]  Yeah, this chilling effect.
[02:19:44.341 --> 02:19:47.262]  Well, they arrest the guy who wore the shirt that said, I'm against the war.
[02:19:47.282 --> 02:19:55.325]  I don't care if it said, I'm for the war, or I don't care about the war, or I love the war, or the war is bad.
[02:19:55.766 --> 02:19:57.046]  They arrest him at a mall.
[02:19:57.066 --> 02:20:04.029]  I was swimming today for exercise, and there was a New York University professor swimming.
[02:20:05.061 --> 02:20:06.902]  And they said, oh, you're Alex Jones.
[02:20:06.942 --> 02:20:11.064]  I'm down visiting from New York, but I know you just won the Project Censored Award.
[02:20:11.084 --> 02:20:12.986]  It's a pretty big deal.
[02:20:13.006 --> 02:20:15.347]  I got second place out of, like, thousands of people.
[02:20:15.367 --> 02:20:16.648]  I didn't even know this happened.
[02:20:16.668 --> 02:20:17.748]  I just found out about it last week.
[02:20:22.595 --> 02:20:30.000]  The professor went on to say, yeah, at our college, one of the kids wrote just a tame article about Bush lying about weapons of mass destruction.
[02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:33.842]  Secret Service showed up, shook him down, threatened him, said, are you a terrorist?
[02:20:34.343 --> 02:20:35.784]  You know, but they don't do that to me.
[02:20:36.124 --> 02:20:37.925]  They don't do that to most of the patriots who are out front.
[02:20:37.945 --> 02:20:41.587]  They do it to little people, put it in the paper to scare everybody.
[02:20:41.607 --> 02:20:42.868]  It doesn't scare me.
[02:20:43.528 --> 02:20:45.049]  I could walk out of the studio tonight.
[02:20:45.069 --> 02:20:47.471]  They could blow my head all over the wall.
[02:20:48.592 --> 02:20:49.032]  You know what?
[02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:50.611]  I want to keep living.
[02:20:50.631 --> 02:20:54.493]  I enjoy life, but I'm not going to commit my children and my family to living hell.
[02:20:54.853 --> 02:20:56.034]  I'm not a coward, folks.
[02:20:56.414 --> 02:20:58.295]  I don't go along with the beast system.
[02:20:59.496 --> 02:21:00.517]  And I'm not afraid.
[02:21:01.297 --> 02:21:02.878]  And, you know, courage, folks.
[02:21:05.019 --> 02:21:08.181]  They say you're still afraid, but you just do what you've got to do.
[02:21:08.201 --> 02:21:09.442]  I don't know what they're talking about.
[02:21:11.167 --> 02:21:18.453]  I mean, I love my family, and what mother or father wouldn't jump in front of a car knowing it was certain death of their child?
[02:21:18.693 --> 02:21:22.156]  Who wouldn't jump off a cliff knowing it would save their family?
[02:21:24.138 --> 02:21:35.727]  I mean, when I see a bunch of wicked criminals abusing and doing horrible things and setting up evils that are just unspeakable, it isn't even a question, folks.
[02:21:36.608 --> 02:21:39.470]  There isn't even a moment of hesitation.
[02:21:40.749 --> 02:21:42.210]  I'm on the course I'm on.
[02:21:42.250 --> 02:21:43.231]  I'm not stopping.
[02:21:45.073 --> 02:21:46.114]  You understand that?
[02:21:47.035 --> 02:21:53.601]  You understand this is about humanity and future generations go out, span out forever?
[02:21:54.482 --> 02:21:55.703]  You know what the globalists are?
[02:21:55.743 --> 02:21:56.984]  You know how evil they are?
[02:21:57.004 --> 02:21:59.306]  People go, well, yeah, that's why we're not fighting them.
[02:21:59.626 --> 02:22:00.367]  What do you mean?
[02:22:00.407 --> 02:22:01.508]  What's wrong with you?
[02:22:03.189 --> 02:22:04.731]  There's not even a question here.
[02:22:05.908 --> 02:22:07.589]  You've got to get your heads out of the sand.
[02:22:07.769 --> 02:22:10.671]  You've got to face the whole truth, just like Patrick Henry said.
[02:22:10.691 --> 02:22:17.395]  You've got to have it knock you off your horse like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus.
[02:22:19.696 --> 02:22:23.618]  You've got to wake up now, folks, and commit yourself.
[02:22:23.758 --> 02:22:24.679]  I am so blessed.
[02:22:24.799 --> 02:22:28.561]  I am so thankful that God put me on this path.
[02:22:29.321 --> 02:22:31.162]  I'll be honored to die for humanity.
[02:22:31.182 --> 02:22:32.763]  I'll be honored to die for my family.
[02:22:33.043 --> 02:22:34.064]  I'll be honored.
[02:22:34.969 --> 02:22:40.433]  To not go along to get along and to fight this pack of psychopaths.
[02:22:41.253 --> 02:22:47.818]  I mean, if I saw people robbing an old lady and they had weapons and I was barehanded, I would go fight.
[02:22:48.138 --> 02:22:50.400]  I just... Is something wrong with me?
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:51.720]  I'd take them on!
[02:22:54.062 --> 02:22:55.103]  I don't understand it.
[02:22:56.824 --> 02:22:57.805]  I don't understand it.
[02:22:58.905 --> 02:22:59.966]  That goes for all of you.
[02:23:00.066 --> 02:23:00.947]  In government, too.
[02:23:01.127 --> 02:23:02.027]  Join us.
[02:23:02.308 --> 02:23:03.328]  Join humanity.
[02:23:03.689 --> 02:23:03.849]  Wow!
[02:23:05.629 --> 02:23:06.531]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.032 --> 02:23:08.635]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.556 --> 02:23:12.241]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.439 --> 02:23:16.860]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:47.057 --> 02:23:48.658]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:48.678 --> 02:24:01.105]  I mean, the globalists have said in their own UNESCO documents, we've read them on air, Newsmax has posted them, official stuff that, quote, the families of disease must be eradicated.
[02:24:01.145 --> 02:24:02.325]  Bush just signed on to that.
[02:24:02.866 --> 02:24:05.047]  They're saying they want to eradicate our families?
[02:24:05.087 --> 02:24:09.029]  The globalists are doing all these horrible things genetically to us?
[02:24:10.609 --> 02:24:10.989]  We're good to go.
[02:24:29.068 --> 02:24:31.690]  But we're not going to charge anybody because it was under government orders.
[02:24:32.130 --> 02:24:34.032]  Yes, the government murders our own troops.
[02:24:34.072 --> 02:24:35.913]  I mean, that's murder, folks!
[02:24:35.973 --> 02:24:37.834]  The government is not God!
[02:24:38.235 --> 02:24:41.337]  America was about the government not being God!
[02:24:42.638 --> 02:24:50.764]  And now we've got the most sinister globalist ever running things, and people just sit here with our whole society and our families under attack?
[02:24:51.616 --> 02:24:58.658]  And cowardly go, I can get in trouble fighting and I better go along with it.
[02:24:59.158 --> 02:25:02.079]  What do you think these sickos will do if you go along with them?
[02:25:03.819 --> 02:25:04.820]  We've got to fight them.
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:06.560]  Somebody's got to have honor.
[02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:09.501]  Somebody's got to not be a whore for the New World Order.
[02:25:11.361 --> 02:25:14.542]  Like Arnold Gungrab abortion promoter.
[02:25:15.142 --> 02:25:16.403]  No, that's not conservative.
[02:25:16.803 --> 02:25:20.844]  Every time you see a neocon promote him or defend him, it ought to make you puke.
[02:25:25.817 --> 02:25:26.537]  I'm serious.
[02:25:26.557 --> 02:25:28.318]  You guys are being warped out there.
[02:25:28.338 --> 02:25:31.078]  All right, I don't want to get off on this anymore.
[02:25:31.098 --> 02:25:32.019]  Let me cover news.
[02:25:32.659 --> 02:25:37.600]  Australia's spy agency warns of biological chemical attacks.
[02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:42.441]  Oh, I have official Australian documents where they wanted to kill half the third world with this stuff.
[02:25:42.822 --> 02:25:44.402]  That's in Road to Tyranny, by the way.
[02:25:45.436 --> 02:25:54.398]  A biological or chemical attack carried out by terrorists is only a matter of time, said Dennis Richardson, the chief of Australia's security agency.
[02:25:54.999 --> 02:25:58.459]  Oh, you've had a lot of your top weapons experts die lately, haven't you, though?
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:01.520]  Those that developed this stuff for you, they thought it was for peaceful uses.
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:03.021]  They wouldn't go along.
[02:26:03.381 --> 02:26:05.541]  They'd know where it came from when it got released.
[02:26:06.001 --> 02:26:08.022]  They're all dying, aren't they?
[02:26:08.926 --> 02:26:21.329]  There's a genuine concern that a catastrophic attack is certainly only a matter of time, said Richardson, the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization.
[02:26:21.949 --> 02:26:27.970]  It's unlikely a victory in the war against terrorism will be declared anytime soon, he said.
[02:26:28.090 --> 02:26:28.670]  Oh, no!
[02:26:29.310 --> 02:26:30.871]  Everyone's got to totally enslave you.
[02:26:31.611 --> 02:26:32.431]  Lots of camps.
[02:26:33.610 --> 02:26:41.559]  The security body released a transcript of Richardson's speech, which was made last week on the day a car bomb killed 11 people in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
[02:26:42.881 --> 02:26:43.581]  Turns out the U.S.
[02:26:43.621 --> 02:26:52.391]  government pulled out of there hours before that happened and told the Bali's government, that told the Taiwanese not to warn them last year, the Bali bombing.
[02:26:52.411 --> 02:26:53.092]  But so what?
[02:26:53.112 --> 02:26:53.873]  Let's ignore that.
[02:26:54.531 --> 02:26:59.935]  Indonesia blamed the Jemma Islam terrorist group, which had been linked to al-Qaeda.
[02:26:59.955 --> 02:27:00.915]  You mean the CIA?
[02:27:00.935 --> 02:27:02.536]  When I hear al-Qaeda, I think CIA.
[02:27:02.977 --> 02:27:04.037]  Networked for an attack.
[02:27:04.538 --> 02:27:11.863]  Al-Qaeda in a statement to Arab media the weekend said the Jakarta bombing was part of a series of attacks it plans to carry out.
[02:27:12.303 --> 02:27:15.365]  Able News Network reported the al-Qaeda statement warned U.S.
[02:27:15.405 --> 02:27:19.968]  and Australian nations, nationals about the presence in Jakarta.
[02:27:20.649 --> 02:27:22.670]  Is that the same group that got followed by
[02:27:23.712 --> 02:27:29.416]  By the CIA out to Indonesia and other countries, and then they force the State Department to give them visas back in?
[02:27:29.916 --> 02:27:31.377]  You mean those guys that trained at U.S.
[02:27:31.437 --> 02:27:32.138]  military bases?
[02:27:32.178 --> 02:27:32.498]  Those?
[02:27:32.538 --> 02:27:34.339]  You mean those that are still alive?
[02:27:34.479 --> 02:27:35.260]  You mean those?
[02:27:37.901 --> 02:27:38.842]  Oh, man, I tell you.
[02:27:38.902 --> 02:27:42.144]  We have to brace ourselves for a terror attack in Australia.
[02:27:42.164 --> 02:27:49.149]  Prime Minister John Howard said today on Sky News, this may sound to be grim warning, but this is the way the world is at the moment.
[02:27:50.293 --> 02:27:52.855]  And they'll just hate having to take all your rights.
[02:27:52.875 --> 02:27:54.657]  And they say chemical or biological.
[02:27:55.557 --> 02:28:00.001]  It so happens that it's the Western governments that gave smallpox blankets to the Indians.
[02:28:00.041 --> 02:28:01.722]  But let's just ignore that.
[02:28:01.782 --> 02:28:02.703]  Everything's all right.
[02:28:02.743 --> 02:28:03.524]  Go back to sleep.
[02:28:03.544 --> 02:28:06.866]  They nerve gas troops on purpose and kill them as a test.
[02:28:06.906 --> 02:28:08.007]  But again, you can trust them.
[02:28:09.408 --> 02:28:11.210]  They admit deadly tests over most U.S.
[02:28:11.250 --> 02:28:12.071]  cities in the past.
[02:28:12.131 --> 02:28:12.851]  Deaths resulted.
[02:28:13.172 --> 02:28:14.433]  The tales remain classified.
[02:28:14.473 --> 02:28:15.453]  But that's okay.
[02:28:15.473 --> 02:28:16.094]  You can trust them.
[02:28:16.957 --> 02:28:20.059]  Superbugs spread into community.
[02:28:20.179 --> 02:28:21.260]  BBC.
[02:28:22.861 --> 02:28:24.943]  That last article was out of Bloomberg, by the way.
[02:28:26.544 --> 02:28:29.186]  Superbugs are spreading into the community.
[02:28:29.246 --> 02:28:39.313]  Experts have warned doctors are now seeing urinary tract infections, which cannot be treated with the standard medications because they are caused...
[02:28:40.296 --> 02:28:44.779]  By drug-resistant strains of E. coli bacteria, a major cause of UTIs.
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:46.741]  This is the stuff that eats your skin off.
[02:28:46.801 --> 02:28:52.445]  Now, remember, we were cooks 10 years ago to tell you to quit taking all those antibiotics, but now they admit what it's done.
[02:28:53.106 --> 02:28:54.267]  Same thing with their vaccines.
[02:28:54.847 --> 02:29:05.415]  It means that GPs will have fewer drugs, which to tackle extremely common infections such as cysts, which can cause a burning sensation or blood in the urine.
[02:29:07.239 --> 02:29:07.739]  What do you think?
[02:29:35.749 --> 02:29:37.091]  Oh, yeah, when it doesn't eat your skin off.
[02:29:37.851 --> 02:29:40.154]  What do you think all this genetic engineering is doing?
[02:29:40.214 --> 02:29:43.878]  Now they've got super weeds you can't kill with pesticides or herbicides.
[02:29:44.679 --> 02:29:47.682]  Now they're putting AIDS virus in corn plants and planting it.
[02:29:47.782 --> 02:29:49.364]  Oh, that's Associated Press, folks.
[02:29:49.704 --> 02:29:52.087]  That's this company ProteGene putting it out in the open.
[02:29:52.427 --> 02:29:54.570]  Half spider goats produce body armor.
[02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:56.631]  Every time I say that, I get emails.
[02:29:56.671 --> 02:29:57.352]  You're nuts.
[02:29:57.832 --> 02:29:59.493]  And a month later, I apologize.
[02:29:59.533 --> 02:30:00.434]  I saw it on the news.
[02:30:00.814 --> 02:30:01.875]  Yes, it's insane.
[02:30:02.175 --> 02:30:02.936]  Yes, you're in the year 2003.
[02:30:02.996 --> 02:30:05.738]  They're suppressed technologies.
[02:30:05.778 --> 02:30:09.080]  The globalists are on power trips because they've got advanced technologies.
[02:30:09.961 --> 02:30:16.846]  Now they want to get you out of the way with their eugenics program so they can enjoy all the advanced technologies for themselves and their progeny.
[02:30:18.788 --> 02:30:20.149]  The life extension systems.
[02:30:21.371 --> 02:30:26.994]  To do that, they've got to use terror to get you herded into the cities for the next phase of mass culling.
[02:30:29.036 --> 02:30:30.076]  Oh, it just continues.
[02:30:30.156 --> 02:30:33.698]  Postal ID plan creates privacy fears.
[02:30:33.758 --> 02:30:34.939]  This is out of CNET News.
[02:30:34.959 --> 02:30:36.940]  We've got an AP article, too, on the website.
[02:30:38.961 --> 02:30:44.104]  And they admit the RFID, small radio frequency identification devices, the tracker chips.
[02:30:45.065 --> 02:30:47.146]  Remember, I reported on this five years ago.
[02:30:47.566 --> 02:30:49.868]  Tex Mars wrote books about it six, seven, eight years ago.
[02:30:51.730 --> 02:30:52.930]  The military developed it.
[02:30:52.970 --> 02:30:54.031]  Hitachi's putting it out.
[02:30:54.071 --> 02:30:55.231]  The size of a grain of sand.
[02:30:56.071 --> 02:30:57.472]  Microscopic antenna.
[02:30:57.552 --> 02:30:59.572]  Cell towers can read it from hundreds of feet away.
[02:31:00.973 --> 02:31:03.214]  And the government said, we're not involved in this.
[02:31:03.274 --> 02:31:03.954]  Then it came out.
[02:31:04.214 --> 02:31:08.855]  They'd set up the RFID center with the government, the Defense Department, Walmart, and everybody else.
[02:31:09.415 --> 02:31:13.117]  They had to put it in everything, to scan everything you do, to track you outside the store.
[02:31:13.457 --> 02:31:15.237]  The cashless society taxed you.
[02:31:15.257 --> 02:31:17.838]  And then when there was a backlash to it,
[02:31:18.624 --> 02:31:25.889]  They met with Homeland Security, the heads of Walmart and Procter & Gamble and others, and said, we've got to tell them it's to fight terror to make them accept it.
[02:31:26.229 --> 02:31:28.291]  And then the documents got leaked.
[02:31:28.491 --> 02:31:29.211]  They don't care.
[02:31:29.231 --> 02:31:32.673]  They come out and announce exactly what was in the documents a month later.
[02:31:34.955 --> 02:31:48.244]  And now, because of the backlash, and stores can't do it because of the boycott successfully by American citizens and others, they're going to phase it in through the Postal Service to make you accept it, and there's talk of making it the law in the stores, folks.
[02:31:50.484 --> 02:31:55.768]  The law in the stores, or you have to do it, which is what they've called for.
[02:31:56.569 --> 02:31:58.210]  A government report that urges the U.S.
[02:31:58.250 --> 02:32:06.516]  Postal Service to create smart stamps to track the identity of people who send mail is eliciting concern from privacy advocates.
[02:32:06.937 --> 02:32:11.100]  The report released last month by the President's Commission on the U.S.
[02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:16.844]  Postal Service issued numerous recommendations aimed at reforming...
[02:32:18.769 --> 02:32:19.870]  The debt-laden agency.
[02:32:19.890 --> 02:32:20.690]  Oh, but this will help.
[02:32:21.271 --> 02:32:31.277]  One recommendation is that USPS aggressively pursue the development of so-called intelligent mail system that goes on to, say, using RFID tracking chips.
[02:32:33.998 --> 02:32:34.559]  Oh, man.
[02:32:34.739 --> 02:32:38.401]  And now they want you to take a barcode inside your mailbox, you know, all of this.
[02:32:38.661 --> 02:32:40.442]  And this is the plan, folks.
[02:32:41.423 --> 02:32:42.784]  You better start boycotting it.
[02:32:43.334 --> 02:32:57.284]  And remember, John Ashcroft also said that Patriot Act I did not affect citizens' rights, did not affect the Bill of Rights, that anyone that talked about phantoms of lost liberty or shredding the Constitution was aiding Al-Qaeda.
[02:32:57.385 --> 02:33:00.347]  I have video of him before Congress saying that.
[02:33:01.868 --> 02:33:03.689]  He said, you will lose your liberty if you say this.
[02:33:04.270 --> 02:33:06.111]  We're not taking your liberty, you will if you say this.
[02:33:06.211 --> 02:33:07.192]  It's a threat, folks.
[02:33:07.921 --> 02:33:10.522]  And everybody went, oh, there's no rights being taken.
[02:33:10.982 --> 02:33:13.863]  Now the Justice Department admits the whole Patriot Act was written for U.S.
[02:33:13.883 --> 02:33:15.243]  citizens, all crimes.
[02:33:15.543 --> 02:33:17.124]  Then he says no Patriot Act II.
[02:33:17.144 --> 02:33:20.524]  He says it six months after it's introduced in the Senate.
[02:33:22.045 --> 02:33:22.385]  Okay?
[02:33:23.825 --> 02:33:27.066]  And now he goes, okay, there is a Patriot Act II.
[02:33:27.346 --> 02:33:28.507]  It's called the Victory Act.
[02:33:28.547 --> 02:33:30.547]  He said there is no new terror legislation.
[02:33:30.887 --> 02:33:31.747]  He's a liar.
[02:33:31.828 --> 02:33:32.948]  He's anti-gun.
[02:33:34.328 --> 02:33:37.169]  He is a sickening puppet, but he's not running anything.
[02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:45.041]  But I just, I mean, it's just wall-to-wall lying, folks.
[02:33:45.161 --> 02:33:46.041]  Wall-to-wall.
[02:33:47.102 --> 02:33:49.562]  Right now, Congress is proposing a new trade deal.
[02:33:49.582 --> 02:33:50.683]  It's your trade.
[02:33:50.703 --> 02:33:51.543]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:33:51.563 --> 02:33:52.623]  That's how they got the EU.
[02:33:53.783 --> 02:33:55.344]  Just call it trade and get rid of sovereignty.
[02:33:56.864 --> 02:33:59.665]  Anyone who can get here will be automatically legalized.
[02:33:59.985 --> 02:34:04.166]  Blanket, total, amnesty, carte blanche, unlimited, it's official.
[02:34:06.408 --> 02:34:11.890]  And I want to remind you, Bush says he'll sign the assault weapons ban with added stuff, like a ban on all semi-automatic shotguns.
[02:34:11.950 --> 02:34:13.990]  I mean, how sick does it have to get, folks?
[02:34:14.631 --> 02:34:18.912]  How sick does it have to get?
[02:34:18.932 --> 02:34:20.312]  It's just like supporting Arnold.
[02:34:21.433 --> 02:34:27.895]  Arnold, the guy that says he loves Hitler, the guy that loves Kurt Waldheim, the guy who's doing this last year saying it.
[02:34:30.316 --> 02:34:31.916]  He's for abortion.
[02:34:32.556 --> 02:34:33.837]  He's for gun control.
[02:34:33.897 --> 02:34:34.257]  He's for...
[02:34:35.259 --> 02:34:37.800]  Homosexuals adopting children, and they call that conservative.
[02:34:37.820 --> 02:34:40.280]  I mean, it's a sick joke, folks.
[02:34:40.881 --> 02:34:43.481]  Limbaugh comes out and defends him and goes, well, the liberals are attacking him.
[02:34:43.781 --> 02:34:44.742]  What about the Kennedys?
[02:34:44.802 --> 02:34:49.983]  Joseph Kennedy was ambassador to England, and he was a supporter of the Nazis.
[02:34:50.883 --> 02:34:53.924]  Yeah, and look who Arnold's married to, Kennedy.
[02:34:53.944 --> 02:34:57.105]  I mean, it doesn't make it okay just because somebody else is doing it.
[02:34:57.285 --> 02:34:59.125]  It's like Prescott Bush and the Nazis.
[02:35:00.326 --> 02:35:01.526]  It doesn't make it okay.
[02:35:02.265 --> 02:35:04.726]  And we know Wall Street and the big banks funded Hitler.
[02:35:04.987 --> 02:35:08.529]  We understand the Rothschilds and the Crumps did to bring the world down.
[02:35:08.789 --> 02:35:10.250]  We understand that!
[02:35:12.731 --> 02:35:14.192]  We don't like the Nazis here.
[02:35:15.413 --> 02:35:21.176]  And we don't like the Simon Wiesenthal Center saying Arnold's a good guy and they love him while attacking Mel Gibson.
[02:35:23.337 --> 02:35:24.538]  I've got some of these quotes here.
[02:35:26.235 --> 02:35:27.156]  Here's another article.
[02:35:27.176 --> 02:35:28.857]  I've got some more Arnold stuff coming up in a minute.
[02:35:29.037 --> 02:35:30.678]  No need for general U.S.
[02:35:30.738 --> 02:35:32.039]  smallpox shots.
[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:33.820]  Reuters.
[02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:45.167]  I love how after 99.9% of police, firemen, and medical people say no to the shots, the government who said you had to take them goes, okay, you don't have to for now until the attack takes place.
[02:35:46.019 --> 02:35:47.260]  No need for a general U.S.
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:48.481]  smallpox shots report.
[02:35:48.901 --> 02:35:52.104]  Members of the general public should not get the smallpox vaccine now.
[02:35:52.184 --> 02:35:58.048]  Being given to soldiers, frontline health, emergency workers, case of biological attack, experts said on Tuesday.
[02:35:59.249 --> 02:36:03.632]  Noting that the vaccine is dangerous and the risk of smallpox attack is only theoretical.
[02:36:04.132 --> 02:36:05.373]  Funny, Bush said it would happen.
[02:36:05.433 --> 02:36:06.494]  Gary Hart said it would happen.
[02:36:06.834 --> 02:36:09.596]  The committee said it does not really matter how many people are vaccinated.
[02:36:09.916 --> 02:36:13.439]  As long as the right preparations are in place, the Institute of Medicine says
[02:36:14.409 --> 02:36:19.110]  Committee said, oh, yes, because they're going to launch their attack, lock down the cities, forcibly inject you.
[02:36:19.630 --> 02:36:24.571]  Smallpox is not the only threat to the public health, and vaccination is not the only tool for smallpox preparation.
[02:36:24.811 --> 02:36:30.392]  Dr. Brian Storm, professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and chair of the committee, told a telephone news briefing.
[02:36:30.852 --> 02:36:35.353]  The Institute, an independent organization that advises the federal government on health matters, praised the U.S.
[02:36:35.373 --> 02:36:38.733]  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for its six-month-old vaccination effort.
[02:36:39.073 --> 02:36:39.514]  Six months?
[02:36:39.534 --> 02:36:41.754]  They've been trying to force vaccinate for a year and a half.
[02:36:42.927 --> 02:36:49.069]  And Bush's funded $6.3 billion program called BioShield to forcibly inject you with dozens of vaccines.
[02:36:49.529 --> 02:36:50.209]  It's official!
[02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:55.991]  What a dangerous trend, putting in your body, forcing you to take what they want.
[02:36:58.012 --> 02:37:11.836]  Now, before I read this news, and this is the actual news on Arnold, keep in mind that they're attacking the very people praising him at the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, and mainly the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
[02:37:12.523 --> 02:37:17.525]  Are the ones going after Mel Gibson for a movie that's word for word out of the Bible?
[02:37:19.366 --> 02:37:21.406]  Schwarzenegger's a Nazi problem.
[02:37:21.486 --> 02:37:22.507]  MSNBC.
[02:37:24.928 --> 02:37:29.470]  And it says, here's a question Jay Leno forgot to ask Arnold Schwarzenegger when he announced his candidacy for governor.
[02:37:29.870 --> 02:37:31.970]  Will you renounce your support for Kirk Valtime?
[02:37:32.851 --> 02:37:41.034]  And they got Arnold's quotes here at the wedding of Kirk Valtime, the SS officer who went and ran the extermination programs
[02:37:42.276 --> 02:37:45.300]  This is submitted, folks, against the Serbs.
[02:37:47.182 --> 02:37:49.165]  So I guess, you know, that's interesting.
[02:37:49.986 --> 02:37:55.633]  And after the war, he was wanted for war crimes by the War Crimes Commission, but was never caught.
[02:37:55.653 --> 02:37:56.695]  Then he became U.N.
[02:37:56.715 --> 02:37:57.536]  Secretary General.
[02:37:59.525 --> 02:38:02.707]  Then in 86, after they knew he was a Nazi, he left.
[02:38:03.087 --> 02:38:06.669]  Ten years of running the bloodthirsty UN, became Austrian president.
[02:38:07.389 --> 02:38:25.678]  Arnold campaigned for him, and at the 86 wedding to his wife, Maria Shriver, he said, quote, My friends don't want me to mention Kurt's name because of all the recent Nazi stuff and the UN controversy, but I love him and Maria does too, so thank you, Kurt.
[02:38:27.018 --> 02:38:28.219]  That's when he got his big present.
[02:38:29.187 --> 02:38:30.388]  This is in the middle of a big storm.
[02:38:30.428 --> 02:38:34.792]  He also said in his 76 film, Pumping Iron, right here, that he admired Adolf Hitler.
[02:38:37.374 --> 02:38:46.563]  And in 1998, according to Schwarzenegger, they attended the second inauguration of Waldheim's successor, President Thomas Flustel.
[02:38:47.423 --> 02:38:52.108]  And there's photos on Infowars.com of him a year ago with Waldheim.
[02:38:52.168 --> 02:38:53.169]  They vacationed together.
[02:38:53.189 --> 02:38:54.430]  It was like Bush and Bin Laden.
[02:38:55.939 --> 02:39:00.664]  And in a Playboy interview, he said that he supported Voltheim in 88.
[02:39:00.884 --> 02:39:03.887]  Got it all right here.
[02:39:03.907 --> 02:39:05.449]  It goes on and on and on.
[02:39:05.869 --> 02:39:16.180]  Then you've got Rabbi Hare, same guy, same guy in Reuters attacking Mel Gibson, saying how wonderful Arnold Schwarzenegger is.
[02:39:19.781 --> 02:39:20.322]  And it goes on.
[02:39:20.342 --> 02:39:21.843]  Okay, well, even the MSNBC says, wait a minute.
[02:39:21.863 --> 02:39:22.964]  They don't give you the real meat, folks.
[02:39:22.984 --> 02:39:24.906]  You have to read the foreign papers for that.
[02:39:24.926 --> 02:39:25.086]  But...
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:46.442]  Arnold says he admires Adolf Hitler, folks.
[02:39:47.403 --> 02:39:52.646]  He goes over there and they vacation with Kurt Voltheim, his mother.
[02:39:52.666 --> 02:39:56.689]  Arnold's mother is married after the other Nazi captain died, his other dad.
[02:39:57.470 --> 02:40:04.775]  He went and his mother got married to the head of the parliament who was a colonel in the SS.
[02:40:05.415 --> 02:40:07.937]  His dad was an SS police chief over a whole city.
[02:40:09.608 --> 02:40:18.130]  When you read Time Magazine, when they're comparing Arnold to Reagan, it says Arnold, Arnold, Arnold, Arnold.
[02:40:18.550 --> 02:40:20.110]  His dad was a police chief.
[02:40:20.531 --> 02:40:22.191]  Reagan's dad was a shoe salesman.
[02:40:23.551 --> 02:40:24.551]  I mean, look at it.
[02:40:24.591 --> 02:40:35.514]  And you look at Rabbi Hare just savaging, just savaging Mel Gibson, who makes a movie that is the text of the Bible.
[02:40:37.606 --> 02:40:39.787]  Jesus said those things to the Pharisees.
[02:40:41.047 --> 02:40:41.848]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:40:41.868 --> 02:40:46.790]  Oh, by the way, Arnold's name is Arnold Alos Schwarzenegger.
[02:40:47.870 --> 02:40:54.433]  And Alos is, well, that so happens to be Adolf Hitler's middle name and Adolf Hitler's daddy's name.
[02:40:55.413 --> 02:40:58.594]  But again, oh, we'll just ignore that.
[02:40:58.634 --> 02:41:00.395]  There's more information there.
[02:41:00.615 --> 02:41:02.616]  His dad was an admitted admirer of Hitler, and so was Arnold.
[02:41:04.294 --> 02:41:10.119]  And there's an article called The Governator by the London Guardian that really gets into the tale of Arnold and how much he loves Hitler.
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:13.101]  And this is a guy on the record saying he loves Hitler, folks.
[02:41:15.083 --> 02:41:23.970]  But to the rescue, Governor Hatch, Hatch for foreign-born hopefuls, Salt Lake City Tribune, I bet you hadn't heard about this.
[02:41:24.851 --> 02:41:26.012]  They want him to be president.
[02:41:26.761 --> 02:41:30.943]  And we have the article where they picked him to be the governor at the Bohemian Grove.
[02:41:30.963 --> 02:41:33.684]  This is a month-old article, San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:41:33.724 --> 02:41:34.205]  We'll be back.
[02:41:36.326 --> 02:41:40.648]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:40.828 --> 02:41:45.250]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.410 --> 02:41:49.792]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:49.832 --> 02:41:51.173]  The New World Order.
[02:41:52.944 --> 02:41:57.168]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:57.228 --> 02:42:04.173]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:04.293 --> 02:42:06.395]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:06.695 --> 02:42:09.698]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[02:42:09.918 --> 02:42:17.123]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:17.303 --> 02:42:22.707]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:42:39.397 --> 02:42:42.898]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:42:42.998 --> 02:42:46.940]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:53.322]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:53.723 --> 02:43:01.646]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:43:02.066 --> 02:43:07.390]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:43:07.550 --> 02:43:11.333]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[02:44:36.633 --> 02:44:40.894]  We are here to pray for the souls of those men hanging outside.
[02:44:41.654 --> 02:44:42.594]  Yes, pray for them.
[02:44:43.814 --> 02:44:46.055]  But honor them by taking up arms with us.
[02:44:48.095 --> 02:44:50.096]  And bring more suffering to this town.

[02:44:53.036 --> 02:44:54.336]  He can hang any one of us.
[02:44:54.356 --> 02:44:56.417]  Dance, Scott.
[02:44:56.497 --> 02:44:56.757]  Dance.
[02:44:57.503 --> 02:45:02.786]  Barely a week ago, I heard you rail for two hours about independence.
[02:45:03.047 --> 02:45:03.867]  And?
[02:45:03.907 --> 02:45:08.230]  Mr. Hardwick, how many times have I heard you speak of freedom at my father's table?
[02:45:08.250 --> 02:45:19.617]  Half the men in this church, including you, Father, and you, Reverend, are as ardent patriots as I.
[02:45:25.258 --> 02:45:28.779]  Will you now, when you are needed most, stop at only words?
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:31.720]  Is that the sort of men you are?
[02:45:33.721 --> 02:45:42.084]  I ask only that you act upon the beliefs of which you have so strongly spoken, and in which you so strongly believe.
[02:45:43.064 --> 02:45:43.564]  Who's with us?
[02:45:43.704 --> 02:45:45.505]  All right, folks.
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:54.387]  We're back live, and I'm just sitting here looking at a picture of Arnold Schwarzenegger a year ago with Kirk Voltheim.
[02:45:54.727 --> 02:45:55.648]  Now, this is the U.N.
[02:45:55.688 --> 02:45:56.509]  Secretary General.
[02:45:56.929 --> 02:45:58.030]  I mean, that's bad enough.
[02:45:58.771 --> 02:45:59.371]  He's a U.N.
[02:45:59.412 --> 02:46:05.357]  guy, and it turns out he goes back decades to do connections to Voltheim when he was a kid.
[02:46:05.477 --> 02:46:10.622]  I mean, and this guy's going to be a governor of a major state, and he's the biggest liberal out there.
[02:46:11.629 --> 02:46:20.664]  I don't mean to spend so much time on it, but everybody keeps demanding it, so we talked about it, and here it is, Salt Lake City Tribune, patch for foreign-born hopefuls.
[02:46:21.796 --> 02:46:23.077]  Orrin Hatch, look at his record.
[02:46:23.117 --> 02:46:26.299]  This guy wants to give double tuition to illegal aliens in his state.
[02:46:26.339 --> 02:46:33.684]  I mean, Senator Orrin Hatch wants to terminate the constitutional prohibition against foreign-born citizens, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and others, from becoming president.
[02:46:34.164 --> 02:46:34.944]  Article 2 of the U.S.
[02:46:34.984 --> 02:46:43.890]  Constitution says that no person except a natural-born citizen of the United States of the United States at any time of the adoption of the Constitution shall be eligible to the office of president.
[02:46:44.350 --> 02:46:51.657]  Hatch is seeking to amend the Constitution or remove this ban, allowing anyone who has been a citizen of the United States for two decades to run for the country's highest office.
[02:46:52.137 --> 02:46:56.581]  The restriction has become an anachronism that is definitely un-American.
[02:46:56.682 --> 02:46:57.943]  Oh, shut up, Hatch!
[02:46:59.064 --> 02:47:03.348]  Other countries won't even let somebody be in the federal government unless they were born there.
[02:47:03.428 --> 02:47:04.749]  Shut up, you little gun-grabber!
[02:47:05.149 --> 02:47:07.792]  Oh, I'm so sick of these neocon Trojan horses!
[02:47:08.689 --> 02:47:12.512]  This restriction has become an anachronism that is decidedly un-American.
[02:47:12.552 --> 02:47:13.353]  You're un-American.
[02:47:13.733 --> 02:47:27.946]  Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one-time presidential candidate, said when he introduced the changes last week, a retired University of Alabama history professor, Boris McDonald, said the prohibition made sense when it was included in the Constitution.
[02:47:29.230 --> 02:47:31.992]  And it says, I'm not sure the reasoning is entirely outdated.
[02:47:32.032 --> 02:47:38.658]  He said that 15 years before the Constitution was written, foreign operatives from Russia, Prussia, and Austria, Austria!
[02:47:40.159 --> 02:47:46.864]  Inspired to get a favorable monarch elected to lead Poland, once in place, the country was divided up among the three powers.
[02:47:47.505 --> 02:47:50.047]  The American fathers were accurately sensitive to the prospect.
[02:47:50.567 --> 02:47:55.809]  McDonald said, he said it is unlikely, although not inconceivable, that something like that could happen today.
[02:47:56.189 --> 02:47:57.029]  It already happened.
[02:47:57.049 --> 02:47:58.730]  The globalists already got their people in.
[02:47:59.110 --> 02:48:02.111]  Now they just want to gut this country like a Sunday hog.
[02:48:04.312 --> 02:48:06.012]  Man, I'm sick of it.
[02:48:07.473 --> 02:48:10.634]  Hey, I'm pro-gun, I'm pro-border, I'm pro-sovereignty, pro-family.
[02:48:10.954 --> 02:48:12.855]  That means I'm a communist to these neocons.
[02:48:12.875 --> 02:48:19.217]  Of course, Ron Paul just gave the big speech that the neocons are the Trotskyites, the Hitlerites, the New World Orderites.
[02:48:20.032 --> 02:48:20.793]  I'm out of time.
[02:48:20.853 --> 02:48:21.573]  Great show.
[02:48:21.593 --> 02:48:25.955]  A lot of news we didn't cover is on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:27.116 --> 02:48:28.037]  Be sure and visit it.

[02:48:32.379 --> 02:48:33.019]  It's excellent.
[02:48:33.119 --> 02:48:34.100]  Covers the New World Order.
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:36.761]  A new book I published with Paul Watson is excellent.
[02:48:37.282 --> 02:48:38.262]  Ordered Out of Chaos.
[02:48:38.783 --> 02:48:40.924]  Elite Sponsored Terrorism and the New World Order.

[02:48:55.133 --> 02:48:58.756]  Start waking people up, exposing these globalist pieces of filth.

[02:49:20.485 --> 02:49:21.626]  Resist the globalists.
[02:49:21.886 --> 02:49:23.247]  Republican and Democrat.
[02:49:26.834 --> 02:49:30.725]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:49:30.966 --> 02:49:36.402]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
