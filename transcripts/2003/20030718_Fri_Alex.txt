[00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:06.090]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:15.272]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:16.993]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.713 --> 00:00:18.894]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:20.295]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:21.956]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:26.299]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.922]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.565 --> 00:00:35.726]  Alright, my friends.
[00:00:36.146 --> 00:00:40.269]  Welcome back to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:47.330]  And it is Friday, the 18th of July, 2003.
[00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.293]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:56.976]  And we don't have any guests coming up today because I want to take your calls and cover the news.
[00:00:57.036 --> 00:01:00.699]  In fact, I'm going to accelerate through news for the next 30 minutes.
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.625]  Then I'm going to open the phones up and take a half hour of calls on any issue you'd like to discuss, any news item we've failed to mention.
[00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:11.666]  It's always interesting to take your calls.
[00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:17.130]  And we will then get back in the news in the second and third hour, continuing with your calls.
[00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.332]  It's Open Line Friday, as they say.
[00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:22.513]  Call the free number to join us on-air, 800-259-9231.
[00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:23.954]  Big news day for you.
[00:01:30.648 --> 00:01:36.592]  We know that there were leaks inside the British government by people that didn't like being part of, quote, the New World Order.
[00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:41.996]  And Tony Blair said that at the Congress yesterday and was hailed by neocons.
[00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:51.943]  Now, this is a big government, known communist, and that's where his roots lie, a big government socialist, and the conservatives were worshiping him.
[00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:58.187]  And he said, New World Order, not once, but twice in his dirty little speech.
[00:01:58.287 --> 00:01:59.328]  I have the text of it here.
[00:02:01.273 --> 00:02:05.375]  And he couched it with, our new world must have order.
[00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:06.656]  Yes.
[00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:19.242]  So, Tony Blair, but the guy that the evidence shows blew the whistle on lying by the government, premeditated lying, well, he went for a walk and was found face down dead.
[00:02:19.262 --> 00:02:24.724]  But don't worry, the British intelligence is investigating their own obvious murder.
[00:02:25.484 --> 00:02:28.426]  And I'm sure they'll rule it an accident or a suicide.
[00:02:29.184 --> 00:02:31.825]  Kind of like Fammy Malick up in Arkansas for Clinton.
[00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:40.970]  Somebody cuts their arms and legs and heads off and puts themselves in a plastic bag and then pours gasoline on themselves and then lights themselves on fire.
[00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:43.151]  That's a suicide, folks!
[00:02:44.092 --> 00:02:51.816]  It's like coming in and someone's put themselves in a meat grinder and then put the sausage that was made out of it into boxes and put in a freezer.
[00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:56.068]  And then drives the truck that brings it to market or something.
[00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.393]  Speaking of cannibalism, it's real big with the culture of death crowd.
[00:03:01.173 --> 00:03:09.261]  Rolling Stone has reported, a liberal publication, about how the homosexuals, quote, want to get AIDS.
[00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.202]  It's a culture of death.
[00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:13.085]  Well, in Germany, cannibalism is big.
[00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:15.948]  They'll cut their arms and legs off and eat them at large dinners.
[00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.793]  But now they're volunteering to be killed and be gobbled in large death rings.
[00:03:21.813 --> 00:03:23.555]  This is BBC.
[00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:25.916]  I mean, any type of depravity.
[00:03:26.296 --> 00:03:30.479]  Stuff that never has even entered our minds is going on out there.
[00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.941]  And I'm committing a hate crime criticizing the cannibalism.
[00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:37.023]  By the way, according to Scotland Yard, it's diverse for the unit.
[00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:38.684]  I'm not joking, folks.
[00:03:38.804 --> 00:03:42.807]  I will probably be arrested someday just for reporting that this is deviant behavior.
[00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:50.522]  One of the top media presenters over in England, we had him on the show last year, was arrested for using the word homosexual instead of gay.
[00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:54.404]  You notice all the articles say gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, which isn't the proper word.
[00:03:55.124 --> 00:03:56.865]  Homosexual, heterosexual,
[00:03:57.874 --> 00:04:03.439]  I'm not saying all of them, but a larger group, and it's very dangerous, and it's horrible, and I'm a hate criminal for even reporting it.
[00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:27.213]  That goes past anything that I had ever even thought of.
[00:04:28.174 --> 00:04:38.281]  People volunteering to be eaten and being killed and slaughtered and butchered like a hog.
[00:04:38.301 --> 00:04:40.663]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:42.704 --> 00:04:44.445]  It's a big fetish here in the U.S.
[00:04:44.486 --> 00:04:47.948]  that's been reported in the news to go to Mexico and have your legs cut off and to eat them.
[00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:53.432]  But when you run out of the long ham, that's what you call human flesh,
[00:04:54.213 --> 00:05:01.682]  Well, you gotta resort to killing yourself so others, you know, it's a sacrifice you make so they can have the delicious meal.
[00:05:02.383 --> 00:05:03.945]  But again, I'm radical and extreme.
[00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:05.026]  I'm against this.
[00:05:05.366 --> 00:05:06.668]  I'm also pro-gun, by the way.
[00:05:06.748 --> 00:05:08.130]  It means I'm a liberal.
[00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.831]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:10.993]  Commodities.
[00:05:11.474 --> 00:05:12.054]  Futures.
[00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:13.196]  Options.
[00:05:14.016 --> 00:05:19.381]  While most people are acquainted with stocks and mutual funds, the commodities markets remain a mystery.
[00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:22.083]  It's one Barclay Financial can help solve.
[00:05:22.604 --> 00:05:27.488]  Futures and options investing involve substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.
[00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:30.431]  I'm Patrick T. Parker for Barclay Financial.
[00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:31.933]  Right now, the U.S.
[00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:36.577]  trade deficit and budget deficits are rising to historical levels.
[00:05:37.077 --> 00:05:42.063]  Interest rates are at some of the lowest levels we have ever seen, and yet the economy is still weak.
[00:05:42.464 --> 00:05:44.846]  And we feel this could spell trouble for the dollar.
[00:05:45.187 --> 00:05:48.411]  To Barclay Financial, that spells opportunity.
[00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:50.974]  The European currency has been on the rise.
[00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:57.241]  We feel it will keep on rising, and as a result, we're recommending the purchase of call options on the euro currency.
[00:05:57.541 --> 00:06:01.463]  For a free special market report on the euro currency, call 1-800-348-4100.
[00:06:01.563 --> 00:06:06.265]  That's 1-800-348-4100.
[00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:09.907]  Barclay Financial, mystery solved.
[00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:14.610]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.232]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:23.794]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:23.814 --> 00:06:25.115]  The New World Order?
[00:06:25.951 --> 00:06:26.271]  Panama.
[00:06:26.932 --> 00:06:31.154]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:31.214 --> 00:06:38.159]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.340]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:50.967]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:51.267 --> 00:06:56.631]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[00:07:11.483 --> 00:07:15.127]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:19.651]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:24.335]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[00:07:24.495 --> 00:07:27.478]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:32.323]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[00:07:32.643 --> 00:07:36.546]  Made of the finest materials, it has a two-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[00:07:36.786 --> 00:07:39.188]  And the Aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[00:07:39.468 --> 00:07:43.371]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[00:07:43.571 --> 00:07:48.795]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[00:07:48.995 --> 00:07:51.937]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:53.958]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:58.802]  For more information about the Aeronizer, call Toll Free and tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[00:07:59.002 --> 00:08:00.443]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[00:08:00.503 --> 00:08:00.744]  That's 877-605-9200.
[00:08:00.784 --> 00:08:01.284]  Big Brother.
[00:08:01.304 --> 00:08:01.825]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:02.565]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:02.585 --> 00:08:03.126]  You want answers?
[00:08:03.146 --> 00:08:03.886]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:26.334]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.915 --> 00:08:31.038]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:38.044]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.144 --> 00:08:39.585]  Yes, it's me.
[00:08:39.765 --> 00:08:48.692]  It's I. Thank you for joining us today on this Live Friday, the 18th of July, 2000.
[00:08:50.778 --> 00:08:55.622]  And three, worldwide edition, and we're going to have open phones.
[00:08:57.103 --> 00:09:10.054]  Well, the big whistleblower that exposed the falsification of documents by ultra-socialist Tony Blair had just testified secretly before the House of Commons, and he's dead.
[00:09:10.074 --> 00:09:15.218]  That night he had a little boo-boo, and he was found dead.
[00:09:16.662 --> 00:09:19.023]  And, of course, the government is involved.
[00:09:19.083 --> 00:09:20.604]  They don't do things like that.
[00:09:21.765 --> 00:09:31.290]  MI5 and MI6 are very nice people when they're not blowing up school buses or bombing churches to blame it on their political enemies, which they've been caught doing.
[00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:36.193]  And, yeah, it's dangerous to be right when the government's wrong.
[00:09:36.313 --> 00:09:37.794]  And people say, well, then why are you still alive?
[00:09:37.814 --> 00:09:41.656]  Well, because I'm on the air and, you know, they whack Alex Jones.
[00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:45.358]  It'll just make my videos more popular and you'll make more copies of them.
[00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:56.884]  And there's so many patriots speaking out who are involved in writing books and making films and doing talk shows that... Now, they like to kill government officials, though.
[00:09:57.005 --> 00:09:59.827]  The government does that to scare others.
[00:10:00.848 --> 00:10:02.870]  And they know that everybody's going to get the mess.
[00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:07.334]  People are going to read the news and understand what happened, and this will get a little respect.
[00:10:07.414 --> 00:10:08.435]  People will shut up.
[00:10:09.355 --> 00:10:11.517]  In fact, as Tony Blair was giving his speech,
[00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:23.806]  Yesterday, where he talked about a New World Order, as the Queen of England's little boss was here giving us orders, this man was dying.
[00:10:25.487 --> 00:10:33.509]  And a lot of people have died, have spoken out about corruption, a lot of news reporters, our government said they would quote, kill reporters.
[00:10:34.287 --> 00:10:38.769]  And you look at the list of those that have died, the dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of reporters.
[00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:44.192]  In Iraq, they're almost all independent reporters who just so happen to be against the war.
[00:10:45.132 --> 00:10:50.875]  Well, in a lot of cases, witnesses would see troops walk up, special forces, and splatter their brains all over the wall.
[00:10:50.895 --> 00:11:02.820]  Or, you know, the Abrams tank would target for ten minutes to get their shot just right and shoot up into the Reuters compound and reporters go blasting out in different pieces.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.761]  So, you know, it's all part of freedom.
[00:11:06.282 --> 00:11:10.665]  Killing members of the press, murdering people that tell the truth.
[00:11:12.386 --> 00:11:13.987]  It's all about freedom, folks.
[00:11:15.228 --> 00:11:18.330]  And the headline of the BBC is, Body Matches Iraq Expert.
[00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:20.892]  So this will be the spin, you know, is it him?
[00:11:20.932 --> 00:11:23.453]  But now they've done tests and yes, it's Dr. Kelly.
[00:11:24.654 --> 00:11:28.557]  The government says an independent judiciary inquiry will be held into the circumstances of the death
[00:11:29.554 --> 00:11:36.136]  The body is confirmed to be that of Dr. Kelly, and the family's seen it, and the police have seen it, and it's Dr. Kelly.
[00:11:36.176 --> 00:11:38.376]  But they say they're not releasing anything right now.
[00:11:38.436 --> 00:11:40.697]  They're not going to say if he was killed or committed suicide.
[00:11:41.857 --> 00:11:51.200]  And it says, uh, the government announcement of an inquiry into the body is Dr. Kelly's came from Prime Minister's plane as he flew for a visit to Tokyo from the U.S.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:58.702]  Earlier this week, Dr. Kelly denied being the main, BBC's main source for a story claiming Downing Street had sexed up
[00:11:59.421 --> 00:12:01.763]  A dossier about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
[00:12:02.203 --> 00:12:05.106]  He appeared before the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday.
[00:12:07.448 --> 00:12:10.870]  On Tuesday, excuse me, that's two days ago, three days ago.
[00:12:11.211 --> 00:12:19.698]  His family had contacted the police when he failed to return home by midnight on Thursday.
[00:12:20.618 --> 00:12:24.361]  So, Thursday, you know, this is just a few hours ago.
[00:12:24.381 --> 00:12:25.502]  It's Thursday, 6-8.
[00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.792]  Hours before it is there, before it is here.
[00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:36.957]  Mrs. Tony Blair, who is heading to Japan for a speech to Congress in Washington, has been informed about the discovery of the body.
[00:12:37.837 --> 00:12:44.442]  It says, sensitive government ministers have said they believe he was the source of Mr. Gillian's story.
[00:12:45.482 --> 00:12:49.985]  Superintendent Perel said the official's family were aware that the body had been found.
[00:12:50.025 --> 00:12:53.487]  A police family liaison officer is with them.
[00:12:53.728 --> 00:12:54.288]  Oh, yes.
[00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:57.647]  Probably telling him how good it'll be to keep their mouths shut.
[00:12:58.727 --> 00:13:12.670]  And then he goes on to say that he had given information to the BBC, but they were kind of protecting him and saying that he wasn't their main source, and he had testified before Commons that the government was lying, and well, he had a little boo-boo, didn't he?
[00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:22.092]  And so he's dead now, and found out in the middle of nowhere, five miles from his house,
[00:13:22.725 --> 00:13:38.913]  It's kind of like the Enron executive over key files that just happened to come up missing and somebody drug him out of his house in his underwear and shot him in the head and then the other key Arthur Anderson accountant got found his decomposing body in the woods but again they're just committed suicide folks.
[00:13:39.914 --> 00:13:50.639]  The Houston Chronicle first reported the police said that Mr. Baxter had probably been murdered and foul play was evident and suddenly they got the message that that wasn't the case.
[00:13:52.575 --> 00:14:04.423]  And remember, the Houston Chronicle on June 24th had the police chief saying that they framed thousands of people and he got caught doing it so now he's apologizing and that the DNA and crime lab is framing people.
[00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:06.445]  So, this is the type of government we have here.
[00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:09.086]  Just down there with that case.
[00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:12.609]  So, two individuals dying, but again, the government doesn't do that.
[00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.190]  They're totally trustworthy.
[00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.371]  They're nice people.
[00:14:16.403 --> 00:14:20.126]  They're loving liberals like Bill Clinton or they're Christian conservatives like Bush.
[00:14:20.507 --> 00:14:23.990]  It's all the same agenda, but hey, that doesn't really matter, does it?
[00:14:25.872 --> 00:14:26.993]  We'll just talk about rhetoric.
[00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:32.498]  By the way, I was doing errands yesterday and driving around doing stuff and going from office to office and
[00:14:34.503 --> 00:14:43.505]  I was flipping around their conservative talk radio and I'd flip channels and it'd be Hillary Clinton, flip the channel, Tom Daschle, flip the channel, Hillary Clinton, flip back, Hillary Clinton.
[00:14:43.525 --> 00:14:51.067]  I'd get in my car, go in somewhere for 30 minutes, come out, turn on the car, turn on the radio, Hillary Clinton, flip the channel, Hillary Clinton.
[00:14:52.867 --> 00:14:56.108]  I mean that's all they talk about and you're like, well you don't like Hillary do you?
[00:14:56.888 --> 00:15:00.769]  Hell no, she voted for the war, she votes for gun control, she votes for open borders,
[00:15:02.009 --> 00:15:05.711]  She tries to block Dan Burton's committee investigating her criminal husband.
[00:15:06.091 --> 00:15:08.112]  I mean, she's got an identical record to Bush.
[00:15:08.952 --> 00:15:11.393]  Frankly, a little more conservative on a few issues.
[00:15:11.634 --> 00:15:13.174]  I'm not joking when I say that, by the way.
[00:15:13.614 --> 00:15:14.915]  In actual actions.
[00:15:16.136 --> 00:15:23.439]  Just because she can't get stuff through like Bush can't her business partner from MENA, who's protecting her and her husband, as usual.
[00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:27.741]  But it's just all this mindless diversion about Bill Clinton and Hillary.
[00:15:29.719 --> 00:15:33.883]  And basically, all these neocon shows are advertisements for her book.
[00:15:35.064 --> 00:15:36.905]  I mean, I'm really getting sick of it, folks.
[00:15:37.566 --> 00:15:42.851]  You got the Mary Madelines and the James Carville husband and wife teams, all two sides of the same coin.
[00:15:42.871 --> 00:15:45.953]  You got the Bennett brothers, two sides of the same coin.
[00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:49.897]  You got the Republicans and Democrats, two sides of the same coin.
[00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:52.255]  I mean, it's all just teams.
[00:15:52.335 --> 00:15:54.196]  It's all a big, a big joke.
[00:15:54.236 --> 00:16:00.540]  You've got the big socialist pushing world government, you know, lying little demonic snake you can just look at him.
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.061]  He radiates corruption and wickedness.
[00:16:05.303 --> 00:16:09.165]  Dick Morris, and then he's on all the conservative shows with them lavishing him with praise.
[00:16:09.205 --> 00:16:12.547]  I mean, it's just total la-la-land sophomoric theater.
[00:16:13.188 --> 00:16:18.651]  I heard one of the big neocons yesterday saying that there's no proof they lied about the uranium.
[00:16:19.454 --> 00:16:29.442]  But it's all partisan, and since the Democrats are using this, it's okay that even President Bush did lie, because the war was righteous and he's a great leader.
[00:16:30.943 --> 00:16:32.324]  I mean, don't you see how they play that?
[00:16:32.384 --> 00:16:41.031]  Oh, the Democrats are against the war, or the Democrats say the uranium is a lie, and so, you know, it's okay.
[00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:43.313]  No, it's not okay that Bill Clinton's a liar.
[00:16:44.346 --> 00:16:52.973]  And attack Serbia for no reason, and the news put out lies of mass graves that turned out to be Serbs, and that Bin Laden was attacking the Serbs, and the Serbs couldn't defend themselves.
[00:16:53.854 --> 00:17:01.380]  And no, it's not okay that PNAC, the President's group, said it was about oil and said it was about a military base.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.743]  By the way, energy documents just got released, they had to release them.
[00:17:05.987 --> 00:17:23.635]  This is a small portion and it's Cheney meeting with the Energy Group with a map of Iraq plotting who gets the oil and by the way that map matches BP and Shell and Exxon Mobil and who got the oil in Iraq and of course now they're stocks up and record profits and of course it was about oil.
[00:17:23.995 --> 00:17:25.056]  Part of it was about oil.
[00:17:26.777 --> 00:17:30.659]  Now it's like saying when the Mafia takes over the city it's just about prostitution.
[00:17:30.679 --> 00:17:33.480]  Well no, it's about drugs and extortion and
[00:17:34.691 --> 00:17:38.834]  And corruption, and bid rigging, and construction.
[00:17:39.675 --> 00:17:41.036]  Second thing, but Iraq.
[00:17:41.276 --> 00:17:43.058]  There's a lot of reasons there!
[00:17:44.199 --> 00:17:50.184]  Afghanistan, 3 trillion in oil, opium, slave trade, you know, all the goodies.
[00:17:50.264 --> 00:17:55.269]  The slave factories with the rugs the yuppies pay $5,000 for.
[00:17:57.671 --> 00:17:59.232]  And then I tune into Neocon Radio.
[00:17:59.272 --> 00:18:02.873]  Neocon Radio is an advertisement now that sweatshops aren't bad.
[00:18:03.653 --> 00:18:04.413]  This is what I hear now.
[00:18:04.734 --> 00:18:07.054]  Genetically modified food is good for you.
[00:18:07.615 --> 00:18:09.735]  Well, a little gun control is reasonable.
[00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:11.616]  And hey, open borders is a good thing.
[00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:15.337]  That's what mainline Neocon Radio is.
[00:18:15.377 --> 00:18:19.319]  Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, all these guys.
[00:18:20.143 --> 00:18:21.143]  I mean, it's shameful.
[00:18:21.503 --> 00:18:23.644]  I could smash any of them in debates.
[00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:25.144]  I could crush them.
[00:18:25.424 --> 00:18:26.545]  I would annihilate them.
[00:18:26.805 --> 00:18:30.025]  I would debate them for 24 hours till they collapsed.
[00:18:31.306 --> 00:18:34.707]  I would expose what they are as Trojan horses.
[00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:36.407]  But you know what?
[00:18:36.427 --> 00:18:37.887]  We're not on 400, 500, 800 radio stations like these people.
[00:18:40.683 --> 00:18:44.326]  We're on a lot, but they're usually the mom-and-pops, and we do get the mom-and-pops ratings.
[00:18:44.906 --> 00:18:49.610]  We do build them, but it takes time, and we're not growing fast enough to defeat these people.
[00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:50.911]  You're going to lose your guns.
[00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:52.292]  You're going to lose your border.
[00:18:52.692 --> 00:18:53.913]  You're going to be track and trace.
[00:18:53.953 --> 00:18:55.854]  The National ID card's going in.
[00:18:56.855 --> 00:18:59.597]  You're going to lose everything, folks, because of the Trojan horses.
[00:18:59.737 --> 00:19:01.479]  I mean, we know Hillary Clinton is a
[00:19:03.146 --> 00:19:05.227]  Piece of trash up one side and down the other.
[00:19:05.527 --> 00:19:11.350]  But it's not a religion of bashing her all day when the neocons are getting an agenda worse than hers through.
[00:19:13.271 --> 00:19:23.896]  And now you got the guy from all reports who was leaking a lot of the key information about Blair who testified and he ends up dead a day after he testifies.
[00:19:25.737 --> 00:19:26.858]  Out in the middle of a field.
[00:19:29.599 --> 00:19:32.701]  I mean folks, Tony Blair
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.891]  is one of the most socialistic, evil, gun-grabbing, world government-promoting people in the planet.
[00:19:40.691 --> 00:19:48.816]  And the neocons are worshipping him today, carrying his speech where he talked about a New World Order not once, but twice.
[00:19:50.657 --> 00:19:55.680]  And those same neocons will get on the air when we talk about the New World Order and call us conspiracy theorists.
[00:19:57.941 --> 00:20:00.082]  See, it's a joke, people!
[00:20:01.027 --> 00:20:02.930]  The whole thing's a sick joke.
[00:20:03.291 --> 00:20:06.296]  Hillary, Chuckie Schumer, Blair, they're all for war.
[00:20:06.637 --> 00:20:08.540]  They all want your guns and they love Bush.
[00:20:08.781 --> 00:20:09.302]  Be right back.
[00:20:10.262 --> 00:20:11.863]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[00:23:27.299 --> 00:23:35.943]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.

[00:23:38.064 --> 00:23:41.826]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.

[00:24:11.045 --> 00:24:13.786]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:13.806 --> 00:24:17.747]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:22.929 --> 00:24:35.514]  The Ministry of Defense and the British government are here in the BBC saying that yes, they believe that Dr. Kelly was the one leaking the information about the lies in the documents.
[00:24:36.718 --> 00:24:39.900]  And the prior knowledge of the lies about Saddam getting uranium.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.340]  We already know they know it was a lie.
[00:24:41.681 --> 00:24:42.341]  That's admitted.
[00:24:42.361 --> 00:24:43.342]  That's not even debatable.
[00:24:44.602 --> 00:24:53.287]  But the people that call into the neocon shows are so incoherent because they're mindless liberals that they can't even debate their own kindred in the false paradigm.
[00:24:54.787 --> 00:25:17.085]  But it says right here, I mean this is horrible, it's got the Ministry of Defense, spokeswoman said, we are aware that Dr. Kelly has gone missing, and we are obviously concerned, and it says, a police officer in the area where the body was found, and again it's a wooded area, and found in a field, and they won't say what was on the body, and that may be sealed for security purposes.
[00:25:17.606 --> 00:25:24.031]  He just showed up dead in a field, and now he won't be able to testify before Parliament anymore,
[00:25:26.511 --> 00:25:34.857]  And so, as they say, Dr. Kelly, who has worked as a weapons inspector in Iraq, had been poorly treated by the government, a charge strongly rejected by the Ministry of Defense.
[00:25:35.697 --> 00:25:40.641]  Of course, there had also, earlier this week, been some threats that he better not testify anymore.
[00:25:40.701 --> 00:25:44.943]  And, well, he had a boo-boo, but we're sorry for him.
[00:25:44.983 --> 00:25:45.564]  God bless him.
[00:25:45.584 --> 00:25:46.725]  I hope he goes to heaven.
[00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:49.326]  I think he will, for his sacrifice to tell the truth.
[00:25:49.386 --> 00:25:52.849]  But understand this, folks.
[00:25:53.309 --> 00:25:54.050]  Understand this.
[00:25:55.643 --> 00:25:58.804]  The neocons are worshiping Tony Blair.
[00:25:58.824 --> 00:26:00.065]  They just love him!
[00:26:00.925 --> 00:26:05.087]  This is a guy who is for 70 plus percent taxation.
[00:26:05.107 --> 00:26:08.169]  This is a guy who is for total gun bans, hunting bans.
[00:26:08.709 --> 00:26:11.990]  This is a guy who wants to get rid of England's national sovereignty.
[00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:16.212]  This is a guy who says New World Order about 10 times a week, and I'm not joking.
[00:26:16.652 --> 00:26:18.393]  All he does is say New World Order.
[00:26:18.413 --> 00:26:19.233]  Just, New World Order!
[00:26:19.273 --> 00:26:19.734]  New World Order!
[00:26:19.754 --> 00:26:20.334]  Global Government!
[00:26:20.354 --> 00:26:20.814]  New World Order!
[00:26:20.834 --> 00:26:21.274]  New World Order!
[00:26:21.975 --> 00:26:22.775]  Global Union!
[00:26:24.367 --> 00:26:27.149]  He wants the three million cameras to all have face scanners in them.
[00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:28.050]  They're putting it in.
[00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:31.733]  Road taxes with satellite tracker boxes.
[00:26:31.773 --> 00:26:32.793]  I mean, this guy's horrible.
[00:26:33.334 --> 00:26:36.476]  And I hear them worshiping him on conservative talk radio.
[00:26:36.556 --> 00:26:38.798]  I mean, just worshiping him.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:47.384]  Again, they're winning because they know how to put a conservative label on it and sell you big government.
[00:26:48.845 --> 00:26:52.788]  I don't want to spend all day on the guy that blew the whistle on the British government lying, dying.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.702]  But, I mean, is this not obvious to your people?
[00:26:57.462 --> 00:26:58.683]  This is so obvious.
[00:26:59.584 --> 00:27:01.886]  And now other people in government will be very careful.
[00:27:01.906 --> 00:27:08.931]  No, they better all speak out now and have courage and do the right thing.
[00:27:08.951 --> 00:27:11.573]  It's amazing.
[00:27:12.113 --> 00:27:18.438]  But, you know, he doesn't have the murder of all those Iraqi children and our troops and British troops on his hands now, does he?
[00:27:20.402 --> 00:27:22.243]  And here's another story on the Washington Post.
[00:27:22.303 --> 00:27:27.945]  Again, they're going to report on all this now that the globalists have already gotten the oil and already gotten control of the region.
[00:27:28.325 --> 00:27:35.968]  Now they're going to burn conservatives and act like conservatism is lying and evil and corrupt and then let America take the blame as the bad cops.
[00:27:36.028 --> 00:27:37.288]  See, I told you this would happen.
[00:27:37.548 --> 00:27:47.091]  I told you after the war they'd burn conservatives and Bush would burn conservatives and energize the gun-grabbing, land-grabbing, socialist arm of the New World Order.
[00:27:47.552 --> 00:27:48.472]  And then now it's happening.
[00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:50.702]  I mean, I got these people figured out, folks.
[00:27:50.742 --> 00:27:51.742]  I got how they operate.
[00:27:52.162 --> 00:27:52.962]  It's a tag team.
[00:27:53.002 --> 00:27:53.903]  It's a double team.
[00:27:54.383 --> 00:27:55.143]  They do us.
[00:27:56.804 --> 00:27:57.144]  U.S.
[00:27:57.184 --> 00:27:59.064]  had uranium papers earlier.
[00:27:59.785 --> 00:28:04.806]  Officials say forgeries on Iraq efforts reached State Department before speech.
[00:28:07.347 --> 00:28:16.890]  State Department received copies of what would turn out to be forged documents suggesting that Iraq tried to purchase uranium oxide from Niger three months before the President's State of the Union.
[00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.031]  Well, I've been saying two and a half.
[00:28:18.071 --> 00:28:18.591]  They say three.
[00:28:19.258 --> 00:28:26.924]  The State of the Union Address Administration officials said, documents which officials said appeared to be of dubious authenticity were distributed to the CIA and other agencies.
[00:28:26.964 --> 00:28:27.985]  Well, they made them!
[00:28:29.066 --> 00:28:32.969]  Also, remember, they found the two mobile weapons trucks and a couple others.
[00:28:33.429 --> 00:28:39.294]  Two were sold to the Russians, two by the British, but the two they showed on the news were sold to them in the 80s by the British.
[00:28:39.334 --> 00:28:40.355]  They had the purchase order.
[00:28:41.366 --> 00:28:45.249]  Everybody, they have laptops with James Weapons dictionaries in them.
[00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:46.530]  Serial numbers.
[00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:47.771]  They knew the first day.
[00:28:47.811 --> 00:28:48.812]  The Iraqis told them.
[00:28:49.553 --> 00:28:51.895]  The Iraqi troops said, yeah, these are for pumping up balloons.
[00:28:52.055 --> 00:28:52.976]  Our troops knew that.
[00:28:53.056 --> 00:28:55.218]  We have the same British systems here.
[00:28:56.018 --> 00:28:56.118]  U.S.
[00:28:56.158 --> 00:28:56.819]  government buys them.
[00:28:56.859 --> 00:28:58.020]  It's the same trucks.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.042]  But all over the news for months.
[00:29:00.102 --> 00:29:01.703]  Look at these mobile weapons trucks.
[00:29:02.223 --> 00:29:03.404]  Oh, they were going to hit us.
[00:29:03.645 --> 00:29:05.246]  Oh, they were going to get us.
[00:29:08.032 --> 00:29:15.095]  And as late as a week ago, I was still hearing neocons go, they have the mobile trucks, people!
[00:29:15.775 --> 00:29:22.078]  Don't listen to these liberals about how the documents from Niger were fake!
[00:29:22.118 --> 00:29:23.579]  That hasn't been proven!
[00:29:24.239 --> 00:29:26.120]  Besides, we have the mobile truck!
[00:29:26.954 --> 00:29:31.078]  We have them, the nuclear centrifuges.
[00:29:31.459 --> 00:29:34.782]  We have mass graves.
[00:29:34.882 --> 00:29:39.226]  And months ago it was admitted that the UN had been there in the early 1990s.
[00:29:39.286 --> 00:29:46.433]  It was a storage area for dead Iranians and Iraqis where they exchanged the bodies like we do with North Korea or Vietnam.
[00:29:47.835 --> 00:29:49.076]  But again, I still hear neocons.
[00:29:49.116 --> 00:29:49.917]  I've heard them a week ago.
[00:29:50.629 --> 00:29:51.430]  Still monitoring.
[00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.310]  Mass graves.
[00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.571]  Model 11 trucks.
[00:29:54.451 --> 00:29:55.492]  Centrifuges.
[00:29:55.512 --> 00:29:57.553]  It's all lies.
[00:29:57.873 --> 00:29:58.813]  They're still lying!
[00:30:00.454 --> 00:30:01.375]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.855 --> 00:30:03.456]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.376 --> 00:30:07.058]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.416 --> 00:30:13.458]  Heart disease continues to be a leading cause of death in America.
[00:30:13.899 --> 00:30:14.179]  Why?
[00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:17.382]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:22.326]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and so you're slipping into recession.
[00:30:22.446 --> 00:30:23.767]  But your business doesn't have to.
[00:30:24.147 --> 00:30:26.509]  Call GCN today and get more customers tomorrow.
[00:30:36.346 --> 00:30:38.247]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:30:38.727 --> 00:30:41.567]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:43.468 --> 00:30:46.569]  Let me just say this one more time for you folks who just joined us.
[00:30:50.170 --> 00:31:01.392]  The weapons inspector, the doctor, the guy that testified, they knew that the Niger documents and other material was fake.
[00:31:02.553 --> 00:31:03.853]  They were being pressured to lie.
[00:31:05.965 --> 00:31:13.530]  This guy was found dead after missing just a few hours out in the middle of a wooded area in a field.
[00:31:14.991 --> 00:31:20.795]  And it talks about how he was being mistreated by the Ministry of Defense, being threatened, saying you're releasing classified information.
[00:31:20.815 --> 00:31:28.640]  He testified before the House of Commons in one of their little sessions with the Intelligence Committee and others.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.141]  And now he's dead.
[00:31:31.161 --> 00:31:33.463]  I mean, that means they're getting desperate, folks.
[00:31:35.792 --> 00:31:39.234]  And they could have easily poisoned him and have the guy have a heart attack.
[00:31:40.514 --> 00:31:42.095]  Or he could have died in a car wreck.
[00:31:42.295 --> 00:31:48.078]  But no, they want everybody to know and go, gee, what happened to Dr. Kelly?
[00:31:48.098 --> 00:31:52.681]  He blew the whistle about lying and he's dead!
[00:31:53.101 --> 00:31:56.002]  You see what you're part of now, neocons, cheering this whole thing on?
[00:31:56.362 --> 00:31:57.643]  I'm sure it's real funny to you.
[00:31:57.983 --> 00:32:01.065]  Of course, it'll never be discussed on the neocon shows.
[00:32:04.295 --> 00:32:09.277]  But, of course, the neocons all want to talk about the Clinton death list, which is very worthy to be discussed.
[00:32:10.437 --> 00:32:19.560]  But, you know, I really don't want to discuss it because I don't want to hear the neocons talk about how evil Clinton is, because they're protecting him and blocking Dan Burton's committee.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.761]  It's all just an exercise in futility, as they say.
[00:32:23.681 --> 00:32:27.022]  David and Ken and others that are holding your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:32:27.062 --> 00:32:30.223]  The toll-free number to join us on air today, on this Friday, is 800-259-9231.
[00:32:33.996 --> 00:32:39.637]  Let me just blitz through some of the headlines so you know what's coming up.
[00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:40.738]  800-259-9231.
[00:32:41.038 --> 00:32:41.338]  U.S.
[00:32:41.378 --> 00:32:42.958]  had uranium papers earlier.
[00:32:43.098 --> 00:32:44.038]  Knew they were false.
[00:32:44.739 --> 00:32:47.639]  Iraq uranium forgeries crudely done.
[00:32:47.679 --> 00:32:48.620]  Newspaper reveals.
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:54.141]  Well, it's like their weapons dossier was written by a graduate student 12 years ago.
[00:32:54.161 --> 00:32:55.381]  They just grabbed it off the internet.
[00:32:55.401 --> 00:32:57.742]  I mean, look, I have the document right here.
[00:32:58.877 --> 00:32:59.397]  Here's another one.
[00:32:59.417 --> 00:33:02.019]  This is Judicial Watch, known as Conservative.
[00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:05.481]  I'm sorry, they're not neocons that Ron Paul's been railing against.
[00:33:06.081 --> 00:33:07.642]  They actually have a real record.
[00:33:09.003 --> 00:33:14.446]  Chinese Energy Task Force documents featured map of Iraqi oil fields.
[00:33:14.486 --> 00:33:14.826]  Yes!
[00:33:15.569 --> 00:33:19.731]  And it just so happened, mentioned some of the companies that just so happened to get the contracts.
[00:33:20.132 --> 00:33:25.034]  And of course, the White House's own documents said it was about oil, but we'll just ignore that.
[00:33:25.074 --> 00:33:29.117]  And notice, the liberals ignore PNAC, too, because they're all part of the team.
[00:33:29.157 --> 00:33:32.078]  It's just that illusion, that theater, make you think there's a choice.
[00:33:32.098 --> 00:33:32.739]  So that's coming up.
[00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:36.881]  Blair sets out his view of the New World Order to Congress.
[00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:40.003]  Again, Blair sets out his view of the New World Order to Congress.
[00:33:40.763 --> 00:33:44.305]  And in his speech, he called for a New World Order and, quote, said that world
[00:33:45.274 --> 00:33:47.555]  Order needs order.
[00:33:47.955 --> 00:33:50.797]  And that the new world needs order.
[00:33:50.857 --> 00:33:52.717]  Just lots of new world order stuff.
[00:33:54.398 --> 00:33:59.140]  And Tony Boyer last night became the first British Prime Minister to address a joint meeting of the U.S.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.361]  Congress since Margaret Thatcher in 85.
[00:34:01.901 --> 00:34:07.024]  The following are extracts, excerpts from the speech.
[00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:09.205]  It says extracts.
[00:34:09.265 --> 00:34:12.466]  I guess that's how the British write in the Herald.
[00:34:12.506 --> 00:34:13.486]  They call it extracts.
[00:34:13.547 --> 00:34:14.427]  We call it excerpts.
[00:34:15.074 --> 00:34:18.255]  Little quirks in the English language there.
[00:34:18.275 --> 00:34:20.355]  I guess they have the real, authentic English language.
[00:34:24.936 --> 00:34:29.357]  I watched clips of it on TV last night and became so nauseated I was about to throw up.
[00:34:30.298 --> 00:34:33.738]  This is their little regional governor coming over to spank everyone.
[00:34:33.758 --> 00:34:35.799]  It's like 1776 all over again.
[00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:40.560]  They're on the offensive because they know the best defense is good offense.
[00:34:41.674 --> 00:34:49.259]  Key witnesses are dropping dead and Blair is jumping up and down in the halls of Congress saying Al-Qaeda is going to get us unless we give up our rights.
[00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:58.964]  And you tune into the radio stations and they're playing all these war on terror promos and Al-Qaeda is creeping around going to get you and the border stays wide open.
[00:35:00.725 --> 00:35:01.766]  So that's coming up.
[00:35:01.946 --> 00:35:05.188]  Also Walmart to forego tracking chips due to protests.
[00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:06.009]  Washington Times.
[00:35:06.149 --> 00:35:06.969]  That is not true.
[00:35:07.009 --> 00:35:07.509]  That is a shill.
[00:35:09.324 --> 00:35:10.824]  We start winning the battle against them.
[00:35:10.844 --> 00:35:12.125]  So they say, OK, we give up.
[00:35:12.165 --> 00:35:12.625]  You're right.
[00:35:12.665 --> 00:35:16.485]  And then as soon as we turn our backs, they begin a large volley attack.
[00:35:17.226 --> 00:35:20.126]  They've announced that the Total Information Awareness Network got defunded.
[00:35:20.566 --> 00:35:26.708]  Actually, their funding got massively increased months ago, years ago, before we even heard of it.
[00:35:26.728 --> 00:35:28.888]  We heard about it on this show five, six years ago.
[00:35:30.108 --> 00:35:33.429]  They said they'd get rid of TIPS, and then they radically expanded under Talon.
[00:35:34.469 --> 00:35:38.250]  So the shows were having a victory, but again, they're moving forward.
[00:35:38.917 --> 00:35:41.659]  Democrat eyes potential grounds for Bush impeachment.
[00:35:41.679 --> 00:35:46.361]  Senator Graham, who by the way was involved sneaking around with 9-1-1, just like Bush is.
[00:35:46.761 --> 00:35:47.422]  More theater.
[00:35:48.823 --> 00:35:50.564]  Blunkett rallies to Blair's aid.
[00:35:51.364 --> 00:35:53.205]  And Blair says history will judge us.
[00:35:53.305 --> 00:35:55.586]  German cannibal charged with murder.
[00:35:56.847 --> 00:35:58.768]  The man he ate wanted to be eaten.
[00:35:58.788 --> 00:36:02.490]  He was part of a 450-group cannibal organization.
[00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:03.631]  They found some other stuff.
[00:36:03.651 --> 00:36:05.312]  There may be multiple bodies in the house.
[00:36:06.147 --> 00:36:12.689]  You talk about the culture of death, very successful importation by UNESCO, the culture of death.
[00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.271]  As Rolling Stone reported, these people want to die, they want AIDS.
[00:36:17.331 --> 00:36:18.791]  This is Rolling Stone, by the way.
[00:36:19.252 --> 00:36:28.835]  A large section, they say now, about a third of San Francisco men who were polled want AIDS, want to die, and there's also now this cannibal-slash-Satanism coming into it.
[00:36:29.175 --> 00:36:34.357]  That's BBC talking about dehumanization, scientists to clone a mammoth.
[00:36:35.724 --> 00:36:37.104]  That's coming up.
[00:36:37.204 --> 00:36:42.686]  Also, you can buy a fish that's been crossed with a jellyfish that grows in the dark.
[00:36:42.746 --> 00:36:47.247]  It's right out of Blade Runner in the Taiwan shops.
[00:36:48.467 --> 00:36:52.688]  So just, you know, your designer genetic engineers right there on the streets.
[00:36:54.649 --> 00:36:56.169]  Yes, very nice.
[00:36:56.929 --> 00:37:00.030]  Also, contamination in Canada sounds warning to UK.
[00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:02.891]  There's hardly any real canola that's not genetically modified.
[00:37:03.947 --> 00:37:06.130]  The Matt Royal Mounted Police have been caught.
[00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.773]  This has even been in the...
[00:37:09.145 --> 00:37:16.147]  National Geographic, the Mounties drive around throwing handfuls of genetically modified seeds into people's crops.
[00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:22.768]  Then it grows up, contaminates, the people have their seed records that they bought them, that they didn't buy Monsanto, it doesn't matter.
[00:37:22.788 --> 00:37:25.449]  Monsanto owns the judges, they sue, they take the land.
[00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:29.790]  Their own statements are that they want to take over the entire biosphere, patenting live.
[00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:31.350]  Massive environmental crisis.
[00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:34.251]  Of course, the environmental groups should care less and are owned by Monsanto.
[00:37:34.611 --> 00:37:36.011]  There they are, Greenpeace, all of them.
[00:37:36.571 --> 00:37:40.155]  They're all bought and paid for by the big people that are corrupting the environment.
[00:37:41.136 --> 00:38:00.855]  So the environmental movement's about stealing your ranch as they splice goaters with spiders and fish with jellyfish and release them in the oceans and put human genes into salmon and then put the salmon genes into corn and then put AIDS virus in the corn and plant it all over Texas and Nebraska, the Texas company's Prote-Gene, source associated press but you didn't hear about that.
[00:38:02.088 --> 00:38:03.689]  See, it's all just off the charts, folks.
[00:38:03.749 --> 00:38:04.589]  I'm about to go to your calls.
[00:38:04.889 --> 00:38:06.089]  It's all just off the charts.
[00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:07.770]  The insanity is off the charts.
[00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.471]  Okay, we're living in total la-la land.
[00:38:11.531 --> 00:38:13.392]  RFID for credit card users.
[00:38:13.492 --> 00:38:16.593]  My wife has now noticed, and she's going to try to go purely to cash.
[00:38:16.653 --> 00:38:18.354]  She goes to Kinko's.
[00:38:19.094 --> 00:38:24.276]  And even if the clerk takes your card, it goes into a machine and doesn't come out.
[00:38:25.857 --> 00:38:27.157]  Unless you're a good citizen.
[00:38:27.297 --> 00:38:29.458]  And now the ATMs are going mainly to this.
[00:38:30.448 --> 00:38:37.431]  We've noticed that Slavet, or Target as we call it, it now takes your credit card, sucks it in.
[00:38:37.991 --> 00:38:39.772]  Talk about the cashless society, we're going there.
[00:38:40.452 --> 00:38:44.174]  Well now, they want to make all credit cards be radio frequency read.
[00:38:44.194 --> 00:38:50.076]  You notice IBM ran the ad two years ago before this was even put in the stores, where the guy comes in with a leather jacket, stuffing stuff in his jacket.
[00:38:50.696 --> 00:38:53.357]  Security guard walks up and goes, excuse me sir, you forgot your receipt.
[00:38:54.138 --> 00:38:57.479]  Scanned, see, by the radio frequency identifier readers.
[00:38:58.129 --> 00:39:04.631]  And his face is scanned to identify his security code access, and that's in the driver's license database slash national ID card.
[00:39:04.651 --> 00:39:09.452]  Of course, I made a film about this almost six years ago, warning you in precise detail what would now happen.
[00:39:10.132 --> 00:39:11.612]  Called America destroyed by design.
[00:39:11.652 --> 00:39:12.653]  You may be concerned about it.
[00:39:12.713 --> 00:39:12.993]  I don't know.
[00:39:13.013 --> 00:39:14.313]  Maybe you want to be totally enslaved.
[00:39:14.873 --> 00:39:22.535]  Maybe you're going to enjoy the 87% tax rate that the OECD has said you will serve under the cashless control grid.
[00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:26.936]  When they bankrupt you and take your pension, maybe you're going to enjoy the one room
[00:39:28.795 --> 00:39:31.757]  Uh, apartment you get in a government-controlled high-rise.
[00:39:32.097 --> 00:39:33.318]  This is the stated plan.
[00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:37.041]  And maybe you're going to enjoy having a camera in your room.
[00:39:37.061 --> 00:39:41.484]  But don't worry, the government says in their policy report you'll have a small area that's private.
[00:39:41.884 --> 00:39:42.905]  This is for your safety.
[00:39:43.205 --> 00:39:48.409]  It is exact 1984, merged with an exact overlay of Brave New World, okay?
[00:39:49.036 --> 00:40:01.948]  By the way, Aldous Huxley did say in a speech in 1962 before Berkeley, two months before his death, this was actually a government plan that he could now reveal and that his brother was involved in as a top socialist known as Julian Huxley, first Secretary General of UNESCO.
[00:40:01.968 --> 00:40:04.731]  We're having trouble denying this.
[00:40:04.991 --> 00:40:09.615]  We had the family on, it was in the New York Post yesterday, where she has a 3.84, 3.84, in the top 1%
[00:40:15.632 --> 00:40:19.113]  Graduating from college at 15, the CPS is moving to take her from the family.
[00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:20.734]  They call that abuse.
[00:40:20.914 --> 00:40:22.915]  You're beginning to understand here, just what we're facing.
[00:40:23.895 --> 00:40:24.895]  Again, it's off the charts.
[00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:26.036]  It's total dehumanization.
[00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:27.556]  We're under mass attack right now.
[00:40:27.976 --> 00:40:28.877]  It's off the scales.
[00:40:29.057 --> 00:40:41.561]  I cannot humanly, with my intellect, articulate the massive scale of evil we're under right now, and the mass mindlessness of the yuppies, the hippies, the rednecks, and all the other subgroups running around worshiping world government.
[00:40:42.972 --> 00:40:44.653]  The sports heads, all of them.
[00:40:44.793 --> 00:40:47.073]  It's just disgusting.
[00:40:47.113 --> 00:40:47.734]  It's pathetic.
[00:40:48.014 --> 00:40:49.094]  We're under mass attack.
[00:40:49.114 --> 00:40:49.854]  Do you understand me?
[00:40:51.595 --> 00:40:54.976]  There's another article here towards the World Central Bank announcing that.
[00:40:55.016 --> 00:40:56.977]  Inflatable human tracking chip launched.
[00:40:57.697 --> 00:40:58.857]  Thousands taking it.
[00:40:58.897 --> 00:41:00.758]  This is from Associated Press.
[00:41:01.318 --> 00:41:03.139]  They say they're going to go ahead and make it mandatory.
[00:41:03.815 --> 00:41:20.647]  For people on probation, Bush charge in Iraq, arms had doubters, house told, bill to stop gun lawsuits under fire, trying to derail that good bill, thanks to verify customer's identity, in all cases through USA Patriot Act, no Fourth Amendment automatic reporting to IRS.
[00:41:21.567 --> 00:41:23.969]  This is from the Sacramento Bee.
[00:41:26.075 --> 00:41:28.576]  Well, that's all coming up, but let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:41:29.236 --> 00:41:31.916]  Let's talk to Dave in Boston, Mass.
[00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:32.576]  Go ahead, Dave.
[00:41:33.176 --> 00:41:33.757]  Hi, Alex.
[00:41:34.177 --> 00:41:34.797]  Welcome, sir.
[00:41:35.017 --> 00:41:35.557]  How you doing?
[00:41:35.597 --> 00:41:38.037]  This is Paul Revereland up here.
[00:41:39.658 --> 00:41:41.098]  Okay, what's on your mind?
[00:41:42.318 --> 00:41:43.278]  Just one quick thing.
[00:41:43.298 --> 00:41:46.179]  You had John Klotmeyer on the show last Monday.
[00:41:46.399 --> 00:41:46.659]  Yes.
[00:41:46.919 --> 00:41:48.059]  Did he give a website?
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.300]  Yes, save-a-patriot.org.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.940]  Save-a-patriot.org.
[00:41:56.932 --> 00:42:02.174]  No, save-a-patriot.org.
[00:42:02.734 --> 00:42:03.074]  Okay.
[00:42:03.594 --> 00:42:03.914]  Got it.
[00:42:03.934 --> 00:42:06.195]  Because he's coming here in September.
[00:42:06.255 --> 00:42:07.355]  I've got to see this guy.
[00:42:07.415 --> 00:42:08.015]  He was great.
[00:42:10.096 --> 00:42:12.476]  Well, he's a good guy in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:17.578]  Do you have any comments about this guy that blew the whistle on Blair Lange ending up dead in the field?
[00:42:17.618 --> 00:42:23.600]  Do you have any comments about this mass, bizarre government police state?
[00:42:25.736 --> 00:42:30.661]  How are they going to do the fingerprints for thumb scans?
[00:42:31.762 --> 00:42:33.003]  Well, I don't know how they're going to do that.
[00:42:33.023 --> 00:42:38.649]  They put them in the grocery store and you come in and they say thumb scan for security.
[00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:40.491]  Takes your print right there.
[00:42:40.571 --> 00:42:43.954]  And they get your print for the database when you get your driver's license.
[00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:46.236]  So that's how it works.
[00:42:47.392 --> 00:42:52.494]  And that's admitted, that here in Texas, since 93, they laser scan your thumb and take a digital photo of you.
[00:42:52.814 --> 00:43:08.718]  That's uploaded, and the grocery stores and banks access that, and they're already doing it with their cameras, and the stores are already putting the thumb scanners in, and then they put in self-serve checkout lanes, get you used to that, then they pull out the service checkout lanes, then they make you use the thumb scanners.
[00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:10.679]  Yeah, the Home Depot's doing that.
[00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:13.480]  Yeah, well, they're putting in the self-servers,
[00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:17.704]  Then they put the thumb scanners in, then they pull out the other checkout lanes.
[00:43:20.366 --> 00:43:24.209]  You understand the control grid, how they, this is how you domesticate something.
[00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:27.592]  Oh yeah, I can see, I understand the control grid.
[00:43:27.952 --> 00:43:31.655]  By the way, it's the stated policy of these groups, it's not hidden.
[00:43:33.697 --> 00:43:34.577]  Oh, right out in the open.
[00:43:34.957 --> 00:43:41.683]  Yeah, it's how you break a horse, it's how you train a monkey, it's how you train a dog, it's just, you know, they're laughing at us.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:51.345]  Remember five years ago the Lockheed Martin ad where the space shuttle takes off in the morning of this prideful feeling and the guy points with pride and his finger gets scanned?
[00:43:52.785 --> 00:43:56.828]  Associating thumb scanning with the space shuttle, with high tech, with American pride?
[00:43:56.848 --> 00:43:58.829]  You ever see that ad?
[00:43:58.849 --> 00:44:00.070]  I didn't see that ad, no.
[00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:01.590]  It aired for about five years.
[00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:02.431]  They've stopped airing it.
[00:44:04.002 --> 00:44:08.185]  All right, well... Did Lord Bush go to the Grove Tuesday?
[00:44:09.326 --> 00:44:11.188]  Well... Did you hear?
[00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:15.431]  The Bohemian Grove meets for three weeks, two or three weeks, and they generally show up.
[00:44:15.451 --> 00:44:18.373]  The Bushes don't normally show up when they're in office later.
[00:44:18.393 --> 00:44:19.014]  Later.
[00:44:19.214 --> 00:44:20.254]  Thanks for the call, Dave.
[00:44:21.335 --> 00:44:22.756]  I really appreciate that call.
[00:44:23.817 --> 00:44:32.684]  We're going to go to some more of your calls here in a moment, but I would ask listeners to have a particular news item they want to discuss or to talk about one of the items I've thrown out.
[00:44:34.735 --> 00:44:45.698]  Now, no one has called in about the subject, I'm told, about the Dr. Kelly who blew the whistle about Blair knowing the documents were lies.
[00:44:46.338 --> 00:44:48.979]  I mean, that's already come out, but now he's dead.
[00:44:50.179 --> 00:44:51.560]  Is anyone concerned about this?
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:54.341]  I mean, is this not obvious here?
[00:44:54.501 --> 00:44:55.861]  Dead out in the field, folks.
[00:44:57.017 --> 00:45:01.119]  Now does this concern you, these snatch and grab operations by government?
[00:45:01.139 --> 00:45:01.599]  800-259-9231.
[00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:07.561]  And what do you think about the spin, the spin out there in the media?
[00:45:14.426 --> 00:45:19.331]  Uh, that Bush never knew that the, that the Niger information was false.
[00:45:19.551 --> 00:45:20.732]  And he never read the speech.
[00:45:21.172 --> 00:45:29.500]  And the White House-owned websites, and they've since pulled them, but it's on the record and this news is reported on it, show photos of Bush reading the speech.
[00:45:30.501 --> 00:45:31.321]  The State of the Union.
[00:45:31.642 --> 00:45:32.863]  Drawing out the margin.
[00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:33.984]  Circling it.
[00:45:34.884 --> 00:45:35.885]  Circling lines.
[00:45:36.005 --> 00:45:36.946]  Changing the speech.
[00:45:38.988 --> 00:45:39.949]  Right up to the speech.
[00:45:41.141 --> 00:45:47.306]  Because, you know, they want to project this image of Bush writing his own speeches and analyzing them when he doesn't write his own speeches.
[00:45:47.346 --> 00:45:48.186]  Most presidents don't.
[00:45:49.187 --> 00:45:52.870]  But they want to create this illusion so they show the photos and letters and say, oh, he never read it until the speech.
[00:45:54.351 --> 00:46:01.035]  And well, you know, it's okay to fib because this war was a righteous war and it was never about oil.
[00:46:01.376 --> 00:46:05.719]  No, we just have the president's own cabinet writing documents about how it was for oil.
[00:46:07.878 --> 00:46:10.000]  And then see, they say, oh, well, the liberals are being partisan.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:10.780]  Of course they are!
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.561]  It doesn't matter, it's still a lie!
[00:46:12.782 --> 00:46:13.622]  It's still bad!
[00:46:13.642 --> 00:46:20.126]  You know, I got accused when I would attack Bill Clinton for being a criminal and a liar of, you're just being partisan, you're just being a Republican.
[00:46:20.146 --> 00:46:22.388]  And I'd say, no, I expose corruption.
[00:46:23.068 --> 00:46:24.269]  And see, I'm doing that today.
[00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:28.532]  I have integrity, at least some integrity on this issue.
[00:46:30.484 --> 00:46:34.267]  And again, I ask the conservatives, how do you worship Tony Blair?
[00:46:34.287 --> 00:46:35.548]  I mean, he's like an icon now.
[00:46:35.568 --> 00:46:39.011]  They're selling Tony Blair t-shirts on the big conservative websites.
[00:46:39.831 --> 00:46:41.292]  He's this big hero now.
[00:46:42.193 --> 00:46:42.934]  Tony Blair!
[00:46:43.914 --> 00:46:46.957]  The most socialistic, wicked leader we know of in existence.
[00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:50.940]  Other than, I don't know, maybe the admitted communist street thug.
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.001]  He's being enforcer for the communists.
[00:46:55.363 --> 00:46:56.164]  Mr. Schroeder.
[00:46:58.586 --> 00:46:59.927]  Old Gerhard, and we've got
[00:47:01.064 --> 00:47:03.326]  Got Bush scurrying about, just a total puppet.
[00:47:03.346 --> 00:47:04.226]  He's not running anything.
[00:47:04.527 --> 00:47:07.709]  But the point is, people think these puppets are, so we have to discuss them.
[00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:19.297]  So we'll come back and take your calls on the other side of this break, and I'll get into Iraq-Iranian forgeries crudely done, newspaper reveals.
[00:47:19.938 --> 00:47:23.300]  But the neocons just keep saying, it's liberal lies, it's liberal lies.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.361]  You're the liberals!
[00:47:25.602 --> 00:47:28.424]  You're the people that vote identically to Hillary Clinton, and I'm sick of it.
[00:47:30.015 --> 00:47:32.096]  And what do you think about Blair's speech yesterday?
[00:47:32.116 --> 00:47:33.597]  Did you see him call for a New World Order?
[00:47:34.257 --> 00:47:39.420]  Headline out of the Herald, Blair sets out his vision of the New World Order.
[00:47:40.481 --> 00:47:48.966]  But you've heard the neocons on the air say, the kook detector, anybody that talks about a New World Order, it's crazy, it doesn't exist, there's no CFR.
[00:47:50.907 --> 00:47:51.847]  I mean, you heard Ann Coulter.
[00:47:52.488 --> 00:47:55.689]  I talked about the CFRs, she goes, oh, more black helicopters, more conspiracies.
[00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:56.490]  You heard her.
[00:47:57.139 --> 00:48:06.423]  I mean, they give speeches, they give speeches at the CFR, calling for New World Order, saying they're going to use terror to get a New World Order, and then we say it, and they go, oh, you're crazy!
[00:48:06.683 --> 00:48:07.643]  You're delusional!
[00:48:07.663 --> 00:48:10.625]  See, that's double think, folks.
[00:48:13.186 --> 00:48:18.048]  So there's just a bunch of news coming up, too, and we're going to have open phones today at 800-259-9231.
[00:48:18.068 --> 00:48:18.108]  800-259-9231.
[00:48:24.807 --> 00:48:29.992]  And we'll talk about this obvious murder of the whistleblower over in England, InfoWars.com.
[00:48:31.513 --> 00:48:33.114]  Are you losing your hair like me?
[00:48:33.134 --> 00:48:37.198]  Then you've got to listen to me about a great new product called NuHair.
[00:48:37.578 --> 00:48:43.143]  It's all natural, clinically tested to stop hair loss, and NuHair is guaranteed to work.
[00:48:43.684 --> 00:48:48.848]  All natural NuHair comes in a convenient tablet form with formulas targeted specifically for

[00:50:31.326 --> 00:50:35.670]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:40.275]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:40.415 --> 00:50:44.779]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:44.799 --> 00:50:46.181]  The New World Order.
[00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:52.182]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:52.262 --> 00:50:59.189]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:01.372]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:01.692 --> 00:51:02.693]  Homeland Security.

[00:52:06.577 --> 00:52:07.558]  It is powerful.

[00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:23.137]  Part 2 of that, because September 11th is such a big story, so much evidence, and it's excellent as well, is Masters of Terror.

[00:53:03.699 --> 00:53:08.584]  L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:53:09.204 --> 00:53:10.345]  Take action today.
[00:53:10.365 --> 00:53:13.067]  Emmett in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:53:13.468 --> 00:53:15.229]  Yes, thanks for taking my call.
[00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:28.341]  The mail person put a letter in my rural mailbox yesterday, and it reads, our goal is to deliver mail to each address within the same 45 minute time frame every day.
[00:53:28.996 --> 00:53:36.060]  The barcode to be placed in your mailbox will be one of several scanned each day along your carrier's delivery route.
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:48.787]  These scans will produce a reporting enabling our carriers and supervisor to measure success in achieving the daily time goal and identify opportunities for greater delivery efficiency.
[00:53:48.807 --> 00:53:58.313]  Yeah, and that's not, and of course that's part of the control grid, and I've read about this in the past, this is about control, and this has nothing to do with speeding up delivery, it's just
[00:53:58.928 --> 00:54:05.891]  To make a record that you did get delivery of whatever government bill or whatever they send to you.
[00:54:06.591 --> 00:54:06.691]  Oh.
[00:54:07.011 --> 00:54:07.832]  Yeah, it's about that.
[00:54:07.872 --> 00:54:09.092]  It's about court proceedings.
[00:54:09.312 --> 00:54:10.373]  It's about land grabbing.
[00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:11.433]  It's about tracking you.
[00:54:11.953 --> 00:54:13.434]  Well, I can refuse this.
[00:54:15.135 --> 00:54:16.675]  So that would be best if I do.
[00:54:16.975 --> 00:54:17.576]  Oh, of course.
[00:54:17.636 --> 00:54:19.556]  You don't want their dirty little barcode in there.
[00:54:20.057 --> 00:54:23.498]  And I miss Brian of New York calling in.
[00:54:23.518 --> 00:54:25.559]  Do you guys have a fallout?
[00:54:26.579 --> 00:54:27.119]  Yes, yes.
[00:54:27.179 --> 00:54:28.700]  I had a fallout with a caller.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.681]  No, I haven't had a fallout with anybody.
[00:54:30.921 --> 00:54:31.762]  Brian of New York?
[00:54:31.842 --> 00:54:32.863]  Over the caller, sir.
[00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:33.783]  Come on.
[00:54:33.883 --> 00:54:35.484]  I haven't had any fallouts with anybody.
[00:54:35.904 --> 00:54:35.984]  Oh.
[00:54:36.465 --> 00:54:38.926]  Okay, my show isn't about fallouts with callers.
[00:54:38.966 --> 00:54:40.907]  I'm not mad at you, but it is kind of irritating.
[00:54:40.947 --> 00:54:41.427]  No, I know.
[00:54:41.467 --> 00:54:45.610]  Well, he calls Tom Valentine, but I used to like to hear him call your show.
[00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:47.511]  Okay, well, he can call him if he'd like to.
[00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:48.351]  Maybe he's on vacation.
[00:54:48.851 --> 00:54:49.552]  Thanks for the call.
[00:54:49.592 --> 00:54:51.013]  I really appreciate it, sir.
[00:54:51.073 --> 00:54:51.853]  Thank you so much.
[00:54:52.453 --> 00:54:53.674]  Let's talk to Kevin and Mash.
[00:54:53.994 --> 00:54:54.815]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:55.235]  Go ahead.
[00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:58.331]  Welcome to the Airwaves, Kevin.
[00:54:59.312 --> 00:54:59.752]  All right.
[00:55:00.212 --> 00:55:09.880]  This David Kelly body being found, it's right in your face, it's right out there, and they want it to be that way.
[00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:13.422]  You know, people say, what are you going to do about it?
[00:55:13.742 --> 00:55:21.188]  And I just want to say that keeping quiet is not going to help your kid's future, and it didn't help the Jewish people who lived
[00:55:21.624 --> 00:55:23.965]  In Hitler's Germany, and it doesn't help to keep quiet.
[00:55:24.005 --> 00:55:25.005]  We have to do what we can do.
[00:55:25.266 --> 00:55:25.746]  Exactly.
[00:55:25.786 --> 00:55:29.667]  They killed the senator on purpose right in front of everybody.
[00:55:30.108 --> 00:55:34.049]  They killed David Kelly, the guy that blew the whistle on Blair, as a liar.
[00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:38.051]  I mean, they could have killed him another way with poison or whatever.
[00:55:38.371 --> 00:55:44.573]  Instead, they kill him and then throw him out in a wooded field, out in the field by the woods, out in the countryside.
[00:55:44.593 --> 00:55:46.234]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:55:47.455 --> 00:55:50.096]  David Bannon, you know, it was great to hear him the other night.
[00:55:51.369 --> 00:55:58.054]  And, you know, as he says, you only keep alive people like this that speak out because they have more that they could release.
[00:55:58.134 --> 00:55:59.455]  And if he did, he'd be gone too.
[00:55:59.475 --> 00:56:03.338]  Do you want to add anything else, Kevin?
[00:56:03.619 --> 00:56:06.981]  No, that was what I was thinking when I just saw the David Kelley right there on Yahoo.
[00:56:07.001 --> 00:56:12.746]  I didn't have to, before the New World Order was there in my face, before I could hit your website, it was right there in the public press for a change.
[00:56:13.126 --> 00:56:19.271]  Yeah, just letting you know, this is a message to all the government bureaucrats, keep your mouths shut or we'll ice you.
[00:56:21.696 --> 00:56:25.198]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:56:25.438 --> 00:56:28.960]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:38.685]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.336 --> 00:56:47.958]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:49.683]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.405 --> 00:56:51.528]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.973]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.735 --> 00:56:54.537]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.288 --> 00:56:59.250]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:03.592]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:03.792 --> 00:57:21.780]  On PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, we are posting, I just talked to my wife, the webmaster for Prison Planet, for InfoWars, Paul Watson, the webmaster for Prison Planet,
[00:57:22.327 --> 00:57:33.517]  We're going to post multiple stories about the Dr. Kelly who testified before Parliament that the government was lying and he was being mistreated and basically threatened by the Ministry of Defence.
[00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:35.030]  We're blowing the whistle.
[00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:36.711]  He's a high-level individual.
[00:57:36.731 --> 00:57:40.132]  We're blowing the whistle about Blair falsifying documents and stuff.
[00:57:40.592 --> 00:57:41.853]  Well, he's dead now.
[00:57:41.933 --> 00:57:43.433]  Found out in the field face-down.
[00:57:43.493 --> 00:57:45.414]  Disappeared after work.
[00:57:46.094 --> 00:57:47.495]  Please step into our van.
[00:57:47.515 --> 00:57:48.935]  And he's dead now.
[00:57:49.015 --> 00:57:50.616]  And we're posting all that right now.
[00:57:52.596 --> 00:57:58.078]  We update with our big update generally at about 12 noon now because we post so much more every day.
[00:57:58.098 --> 00:57:59.999]  It takes about four hours to post it all.
[00:58:01.407 --> 00:58:01.747]  12 Central.
[00:58:02.548 --> 00:58:12.131]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls, and let's talk to Barney in Maryland, and we'll go to Bob, Dan, Bob, and others.
[00:58:12.191 --> 00:58:14.292]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Barney.
[00:58:14.692 --> 00:58:15.452]  Yeah, how you doing?
[00:58:16.253 --> 00:58:23.095]  I'm doing better than Dr. David Kelly, who exposed government lies in England and ended up dead a day later.
[00:58:23.115 --> 00:58:25.216]  You lost another good man.
[00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:27.957]  I got three points, Alex.
[00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:36.894]  Uh, it was really, first it was really nice that North Korea labeled, uh, their missile, uh, made in North Korea.
[00:58:37.675 --> 00:58:39.336]  It was found in Alaska.
[00:58:40.076 --> 00:58:41.877]  Yeah, that's in my film, Police State 3.
[00:58:42.378 --> 00:58:44.899]  Missiles have been hitting us before the Iraq War.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.021]  Uh, dummy test missiles.
[00:58:47.745 --> 00:58:50.327]  How do you know that the missile wasn't dropped out of a helicopter?
[00:59:05.805 --> 00:59:08.868]  Not from American or Russian or Chinese sub.
[00:59:09.148 --> 00:59:18.418]  Because North Korea admits on their own state-sponsored TV that they have shot, what is it, five missiles now over Japan, threatening them.
[00:59:19.018 --> 00:59:23.363]  And because our government didn't report it and told the South Koreans to shut up or they'd lose funding.
[00:59:24.564 --> 00:59:29.689]  So, understand, Kim Jong-il wanted America to know, I've got nukes, he had nukes.
[00:59:29.709 --> 00:59:32.871]  They're saying he doesn't now, but I got articles from five years ago admitting he has them.
[00:59:33.072 --> 00:59:34.473]  He's tested nuclear bombs.
[00:59:34.733 --> 00:59:35.734]  He has warheads.
[00:59:36.315 --> 00:59:37.496]  Our government's given it to him.
[00:59:38.336 --> 00:59:39.658]  But they don't want you to know that.
[00:59:39.678 --> 00:59:49.627]  They want to say, oh, it's to stop it, then we get nuked, as former Defense Secretary Perry said, and then we get into World War III, and then there's no liberties or freedoms because, oh, we're in a war for our survival.
[00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:54.293]  Well, as far as... They want a Pearl Harbor where we get nuked, Barney!
[00:59:54.933 --> 00:59:57.135]  Think of the insane police state that will come out of that!
[00:59:57.675 --> 01:00:06.121]  Well, the way it looks to me, it would be too risky for them to rely on missiles, intercontinental ballistic missiles or whatnot.
[01:00:06.361 --> 01:00:11.885]  Well, the former defense secretary says we will be nuked, Washington Post, by North Korea.
[01:00:12.265 --> 01:00:15.627]  Well, they probably... And they'll put it past the globalists to detonate one and say they did it.
[01:00:16.368 --> 01:00:19.490]  They probably already got their warheads planted here in this country.
[01:00:20.501 --> 01:00:23.864]  Well, the Globalists are totally ruthless, and they want to re-engineer our society.
[01:00:23.884 --> 01:00:26.606]  They're putting the control grid in all around us right now.
[01:00:26.626 --> 01:00:29.408]  Well, they wouldn't take a chance on losing their own people.
[01:00:29.488 --> 01:00:30.669]  They have to have them planning.
[01:00:30.849 --> 01:00:39.715]  Well, that's why you gotta watch out when, uh, exactly, you gotta watch out when the Globalists are all out of town, or at one meeting place, or not in Washington.
[01:00:40.396 --> 01:00:41.016]  Just look out.
[01:00:41.497 --> 01:00:41.737]  Yep.
[01:00:42.257 --> 01:00:48.182]  Okay, and, uh, when Bush predicted the war in Iraq would continue for decades, maybe a hundred years,
[01:00:48.928 --> 01:00:54.953]  Yeah, he appeared to know that we'd have a never-ending guerrilla warfare.
[01:00:54.973 --> 01:00:56.934]  Oh yeah, it's a wonderful bring it on.
[01:00:57.055 --> 01:01:05.381]  He said a hundred year war and 63 countries on the hit list and a national compulsory draft and hey, I hope you enjoy it folks.
[01:01:06.102 --> 01:01:17.531]  Well the way, I think it was in the American Free Press, they had an article where they interviewed these Iraqis that had taken refuge in an abandoned prison.
[01:01:18.328 --> 01:01:23.333]  And they said that they don't have any money or food or anything.
[01:01:24.034 --> 01:01:25.715]  And they've been forced out of their housing.
[01:01:25.856 --> 01:01:31.161]  And they said that if they have to die, they'd rather die fighting than starve to death.
[01:01:31.201 --> 01:01:32.462]  So we're making... Well, that's what happened.
[01:01:32.482 --> 01:01:34.444]  The Iraqis were pretty happy up front.
[01:01:34.845 --> 01:01:37.667]  But after the rapings and the mass shootings, they're fighting back.
[01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:40.310]  And the government claims it's the Goldstein Saddam.
[01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.211]  You know, he's doing it all.
[01:01:42.754 --> 01:01:44.356]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:01:44.736 --> 01:01:50.482]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:01:50.742 --> 01:01:55.868]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:01:56.208 --> 01:02:03.896]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon
[01:02:03.936 --> 01:02:04.276]  I think so.
[01:02:20.453 --> 01:02:26.419]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:32.065]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:33.486]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:02:33.506 --> 01:02:34.928]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:50.710]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:55.734]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.955 --> 01:03:01.600]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.365]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:03:06.585 --> 01:03:13.752]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:03:13.772 --> 01:03:17.176]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[01:03:17.176 --> 01:03:17.356]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:42.196 --> 01:03:46.478]  Every cell of the body has a receptor site for our master hormone called growth hormone.
[01:03:46.899 --> 01:03:49.980]  The role of growth hormone is to instruct the cells to repair.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:55.403]  This hormone is in the highest concentrations in the body between the ages of infancy and your early twenties.
[01:03:55.803 --> 01:03:59.205]  Hence, this is the major reason why the body repairs so well when young.
[01:03:59.785 --> 01:04:02.906]  This is why the incidence of disease is so much lower when young.
[01:04:03.326 --> 01:04:05.127]  This is why you're skinnier when young.
[01:04:05.627 --> 01:04:08.248]  Looking and feeling young is a direct result of your chemistry.
[01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:12.249]  Science brings us closer to the threshold of eternal youth every day.
[01:04:12.889 --> 01:04:15.650]  Cocoon GH is a sublingual form of growth hormone.
[01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:17.811]  When used twice a day, people report
[01:04:18.351 --> 01:04:18.952]  Deep sleep.
[01:04:19.212 --> 01:04:21.034]  Improved mood, memory and energy.
[01:04:21.434 --> 01:04:22.495]  Losses of body fat.
[01:04:22.876 --> 01:04:24.557]  Improved strength and sex drive.
[01:04:25.078 --> 01:04:26.239]  Reduction of joint pains.
[01:04:26.519 --> 01:04:28.141]  Improved blood sugar and more.
[01:04:28.401 --> 01:04:30.403]  Improve your chemistry and improve your life.
[01:04:30.603 --> 01:04:31.944]  Satisfaction guaranteed.
[01:04:32.065 --> 01:04:32.325]  Call 800-814-5031.
[01:04:32.345 --> 01:04:32.385]  800-814-5031.
[01:04:32.405 --> 01:04:32.445]  800-814-5031.
[01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:45.795]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:49.258]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:50.599 --> 01:04:55.503]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, thanks for joining us on this live Friday edition.
[01:04:55.543 --> 01:04:58.445]  More of your calls and a bunch of news coming up that believe me, you don't want to miss.
[01:04:59.926 --> 01:05:01.507]  The globalists are starting to panic.
[01:05:01.568 --> 01:05:03.049]  There are leaks all over the U.S.
[01:05:03.089 --> 01:05:03.449]  government.
[01:05:03.489 --> 01:05:04.670]  Leaks from the Pentagon.
[01:05:06.271 --> 01:05:07.452]  Leaks out of Congress.
[01:05:07.672 --> 01:05:07.973]  Leaks
[01:05:09.117 --> 01:05:14.102]  Out of England about how our governments knowingly have produced a bunch of false weapons evidence.
[01:05:14.962 --> 01:05:23.930]  It didn't fall out of an apple tree, it didn't come here in a meteor, it didn't show up in their toilet bowl or under a pillow.
[01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.416]  They manufactured it.
[01:05:26.676 --> 01:05:29.258]  The mobile weapons trucks that were for pumping up balloons.
[01:05:29.318 --> 01:05:30.839]  They knew day one, they sold it to them.
[01:05:31.499 --> 01:05:33.300]  The mass graves, lies, all of it.
[01:05:33.421 --> 01:05:35.422]  Down the line, all lies put out.
[01:05:35.482 --> 01:05:41.566]  I mean, the Pentagon told us last year they were reauthorizing the Office of Strategic Information.
[01:05:42.767 --> 01:05:45.128]  The Office of Information or Disinformation.
[01:05:45.148 --> 01:05:47.049]  They said, quote, we're going to lie to you for your own good.
[01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:49.311]  So it's just amazing how they operate.
[01:05:50.231 --> 01:05:52.213]  And they started practicing it and saying, oh, we
[01:05:56.167 --> 01:05:57.407]  That report was false.
[01:05:57.928 --> 01:06:01.911]  The Pentagon Office of Information isn't going to lie to you.
[01:06:02.111 --> 01:06:04.653]  That was the next press release after that one.
[01:06:05.213 --> 01:06:06.334]  It's kind of weird how they do it.
[01:06:06.374 --> 01:06:08.055]  It's like they've got this weird law.
[01:06:08.115 --> 01:06:10.897]  They have to tell you what they're going to do to you before they do it.
[01:06:12.178 --> 01:06:13.139]  And this doctor who
[01:06:16.651 --> 01:06:26.921]  I had been involved before Parliament in the House of Commons exposing both in full view and in secret lies by the government and the manufacturing of evidence.
[01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:35.409]  This weapons inspector who was involved in the reports has been found dead today out on the field!
[01:06:36.423 --> 01:06:39.345]  Never came back from work, found out in the middle of nowhere, dead in a field.
[01:06:39.366 --> 01:06:42.448]  The police, of course, won't tell us what his body looks like or how he died.
[01:06:42.928 --> 01:06:49.734]  And the family's got Scotland Yard there caring about them, but loving them and sure getting them back in line.
[01:06:50.595 --> 01:06:54.098]  And, uh, he had been threatened by the Ministry of Defense to keep quiet.
[01:06:54.138 --> 01:06:55.539]  They say he'd been, quote, mistreated.
[01:06:55.579 --> 01:06:56.520]  That's on the BBC.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.982]  And, uh, well, he's dead now.
[01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:01.924]  And this sends a nice message to everyone in government.
[01:07:02.425 --> 01:07:03.505]  Keep your mouth shut!
[01:07:04.665 --> 01:07:06.186]  We're gonna gut this country.
[01:07:06.446 --> 01:07:07.606]  We're gonna gut England.
[01:07:07.786 --> 01:07:09.227]  We're gonna enslave the people.
[01:07:09.427 --> 01:07:10.948]  We're gonna have a national draft.
[01:07:10.968 --> 01:07:12.608]  They're gonna follow our orders.
[01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:13.769]  We're in control.
[01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:14.609]  Do you hear us?
[01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:16.890]  Do you understand?
[01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:18.071]  We're the New World Order!
[01:07:19.952 --> 01:07:32.417]  So, as Blair was speaking to Congress, it looks like Mr. Kelly, right around that time, was a dying out in the field with, I'm sure, some nice men around him.
[01:07:34.943 --> 01:07:37.805]  I wonder if they said sorry about this mate.
[01:07:37.825 --> 01:07:41.607]  You know they say, hey mate.
[01:07:42.848 --> 01:07:44.028]  I wonder if they said that to him.
[01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:46.950]  Out in the field.
[01:07:47.991 --> 01:07:52.353]  They probably took him to a warehouse and killed him there and threw him in the field.
[01:07:52.433 --> 01:07:59.237]  Notice the body got found real quick in a rural, it says right by some woods, where there aren't a lot of people.
[01:08:01.439 --> 01:08:03.620]  They just happened to
[01:08:04.608 --> 01:08:05.128]  Mind him.
[01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:08.129]  Behind a fence.
[01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:16.612]  Oh, but it says Downing Street and the Ministry of Defense is very concerned about news that David Kelly has gone missing and now his body's been found.
[01:08:17.652 --> 01:08:20.533]  Wow, well that's too bad.
[01:08:20.553 --> 01:08:22.234]  But don't worry, the police are investigating.
[01:08:22.254 --> 01:08:25.575]  The government's on the job.
[01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:30.377]  We appreciate Dr. Kelly telling the truth.
[01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:31.457]  He had a good long life.
[01:08:32.802 --> 01:08:35.583]  He stood up against evil and did the really manly thing.
[01:08:35.623 --> 01:08:38.103]  It's hard to go against the grain.
[01:08:38.143 --> 01:08:40.784]  It's really hard to go against the grain when it can get you killed.
[01:08:42.705 --> 01:08:47.346]  And they say it's harder to do that against your own government, like our founding fathers did.
[01:08:48.006 --> 01:08:52.327]  It's harder to do that psychologically, the studies show, than to charge a machine gun at it.
[01:08:53.328 --> 01:08:54.268]  We do it here every day.
[01:08:55.842 --> 01:09:02.284]  But we love our families, and we love humanity, and we don't want the blood of dead children being bombed worldwide on our hands.
[01:09:02.365 --> 01:09:14.889]  So when you think about it, the balance and what we're doing for humanity, the instinct to defend humanity and to resist dehumanization kicks in, and actually an endorphin flows, at least in my life, and I feel good.
[01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:24.453]  They could have me, they could have my head in the guillotine and say, renounce Jesus Christ, accept the New World Order,
[01:09:25.936 --> 01:09:27.197]  Go along with our system.
[01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:28.798]  Submit to it.
[01:09:28.878 --> 01:09:29.419]  Accept it.
[01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:30.980]  Accept the evil we carry out.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:34.142]  Or we're going to flip the lever, and I'd say, flip away.
[01:09:34.162 --> 01:09:42.848]  I hope God forgives you, because you don't know what you do.
[01:09:42.928 --> 01:09:44.149]  You poor little slave.
[01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:45.210]  You coward.
[01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:47.131]  But see, the tyranny's begun, folks.
[01:09:47.772 --> 01:09:50.674]  The killings and the arrests of people that blow the whistle in government.
[01:09:51.334 --> 01:09:56.500]  The tyranny's begun, where the enforcers doing it, when, believe me, when they're killing their own, they're afraid.
[01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:05.151]  And they, you know, when they're driving back after killing innocent good people, they say to each other, well, we got our files, you know, put up in the right spot.
[01:10:05.171 --> 01:10:06.453]  If they do it to us, we'll release it.
[01:10:06.813 --> 01:10:08.996]  They're all busy blackmailing each other and the rest of it.
[01:10:11.665 --> 01:10:12.866]  I mean, you know, how do you do it?
[01:10:13.127 --> 01:10:14.368]  How do you kill good guys?
[01:10:14.428 --> 01:10:15.129]  Well, you just do it.
[01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:16.630]  You know, there's some sick rationale.
[01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:24.438]  Well, he's upsetting our whole agenda and he released classified information about our program to put out false evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
[01:10:25.199 --> 01:10:27.041]  Men, you've been trusting other operations.
[01:10:27.061 --> 01:10:28.182]  You'll be rewarded well.
[01:10:29.404 --> 01:10:30.625]  Dr. Kelly has to go.
[01:10:32.992 --> 01:10:34.793]  Let's go back through the calls.
[01:10:35.414 --> 01:10:40.998]  Talked to Bob in New York and Dan in Illinois, Bob in Los Angeles, Ed in Pennsylvania and others.
[01:10:41.659 --> 01:10:43.200]  Quickly, callers, I want to go to you quick.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.741]  Bob, New York, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:48.104]  Alex, I got a whole bunch of muck for you here today.
[01:10:48.504 --> 01:10:48.885]  Okay.
[01:10:49.465 --> 01:10:54.509]  William Donaldson was appointed the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:58.492]  Yeah, former, not former, always Skull and Bones.
[01:10:58.512 --> 01:11:00.674]  Skull and Bones forever until the day he dies.
[01:11:01.311 --> 01:11:02.212]  Well, the day he dies.
[01:11:22.686 --> 01:11:27.747]  That will kind of hand him his hat and say, thanks Elliot Spitzer, but have a nice day.
[01:11:28.107 --> 01:11:33.548]  Not that I think that he's Mr. Super Crime Fighter, but still, at least we got some action.
[01:11:33.588 --> 01:11:38.209]  Now Donaldson's trying to preempt of all that so they don't even have to answer any questions.
[01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:41.930]  Hey, you know, the people that had the key documents died at Arthur Anderson and Enron.
[01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.410]  Exactly.
[01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:44.150]  They both got shot in the head in cars.
[01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:49.392]  Shredding, shredding the documents for weeks while the government sits around and does absolutely nothing.
[01:11:49.492 --> 01:11:50.412]  Well, that's okay.
[01:11:51.172 --> 01:11:51.652]  They're nuts.
[01:11:52.012 --> 01:11:52.814]  Let me go on here.
[01:11:53.395 --> 01:11:54.817]  Captain Morgan's Rum.
[01:11:55.438 --> 01:11:57.040]  Have you seen this commercial on TV?
[01:11:58.852 --> 01:12:00.813]  I won't know, but I know the captain's been there.
[01:12:01.233 --> 01:12:09.858]  Well, yeah, you never see his face and he's always got this evil chuckle while the little MTV-ites dance around in their bikinis, etc.
[01:12:10.399 --> 01:12:23.046]  But real weird, at the end of the commercial, this guy holds up this, it looks like something out of some sci-fi movie like, you know, Aliens or whatever, and he holds it up.
[01:12:23.502 --> 01:12:31.144]  And it does a retinal scan on the individual that's looking, and it says, oh, you're approved to party, you're 21.
[01:12:31.624 --> 01:12:35.225]  I don't know if anybody picked up on that one, but I found that really weird.
[01:12:36.965 --> 01:12:40.206]  Of course, and I hope somebody sends it to me, please tape it.
[01:12:40.266 --> 01:12:48.848]  But I mean, listen, there was a directive for Hollywood, they had a big meeting with Karl Rowe and Lionel Chetwin and others, and it's admitted.
[01:12:49.249 --> 01:12:50.149]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:53.945]  Watch kids cartoons.
[01:12:54.085 --> 01:12:56.145]  I mean all the new kids cartoons that I've seen.
[01:12:56.545 --> 01:12:56.965]  Everywhere.
[01:12:57.646 --> 01:13:04.488]  Retina scanning, DNA testing, to go to school, being frisked by police in black uniforms.
[01:13:04.788 --> 01:13:09.249]  The UN troops are here in America to keep us safe as the aliens are attacking.
[01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:12.930]  Retina scanning, thumb scanning everywhere and see now it's a
[01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:15.051]  It's a status thing.
[01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.772]  Oh, you retina scanned.
[01:13:17.872 --> 01:13:21.074]  Oh, let's see if you're acceptable to write a passage.
[01:13:21.534 --> 01:13:22.615]  Oh, you're retina scanned.
[01:13:22.895 --> 01:13:24.416]  See, now there's fake IDs.
[01:13:24.436 --> 01:13:25.997]  You've got a retina scan to get into a bar.
[01:13:26.437 --> 01:13:27.857]  I told you to buy and sell.
[01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:29.058]  You go into Target.
[01:13:29.098 --> 01:13:29.959]  You go into Kinko's.
[01:13:30.019 --> 01:13:32.040]  It takes your card now into the machine.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.320]  You're not a good globalist.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:34.301]  They take your card.
[01:13:35.001 --> 01:13:40.562]  That they've announced satellite tracking and taxation to begin in the next few years, of all cars.
[01:13:41.142 --> 01:13:43.223]  I mean, sir, it's horrible!
[01:13:44.703 --> 01:13:46.804]  And the young people are totally buying it!
[01:13:46.924 --> 01:13:47.524]  Thanks for the call.
[01:13:47.584 --> 01:13:50.044]  Two more points, Alex, real quick.
[01:13:50.224 --> 01:13:51.525]  Okay, you've got to quit doing this, man.
[01:13:51.665 --> 01:13:52.965]  I've got a lot of other callers.
[01:13:53.305 --> 01:13:54.505]  One about Mr. Kelly.
[01:13:54.885 --> 01:13:56.826]  He was fosterized, that's all I've got to say.
[01:13:57.646 --> 01:13:57.806]  Who?
[01:13:58.433 --> 01:13:59.033]  Fosterized.
[01:13:59.093 --> 01:14:02.256]  Mr. Kelly, the guy who was just assassinated in England?
[01:14:02.536 --> 01:14:04.177]  Yeah, I'm not...absolutely.
[01:14:04.197 --> 01:14:05.137]  You're making great points, Bob.
[01:14:05.157 --> 01:14:05.778]  I've got all these callers.
[01:14:05.798 --> 01:14:06.338]  I've got to get to them.
[01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:07.919]  I'm trying to make myself to the callers quicker.
[01:14:08.239 --> 01:14:08.780]  Thank you, sir.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:09.560]  I appreciate the call.
[01:14:10.041 --> 01:14:10.901]  Dan in Illinois.
[01:14:11.902 --> 01:14:13.583]  You're on the air, Dan.
[01:14:13.623 --> 01:14:14.483]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:14:14.744 --> 01:14:15.464]  I'm pretty good, sir.
[01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:19.046]  Listen, that's a very syndicate mafia kind of hit, wasn't it?
[01:14:19.066 --> 01:14:20.487]  That's the general.
[01:14:20.928 --> 01:14:22.248]  Well, they want you to know, yeah.
[01:14:22.328 --> 01:14:24.590]  It's face down in the field.
[01:14:26.078 --> 01:14:30.440]  After being threatened that you could be in trouble with security for doing this, you better watch it.
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.301]  That's in the news article and then dead.
[01:14:32.321 --> 01:14:32.802]  Right.
[01:14:32.862 --> 01:14:36.343]  I mean, it's just the message is there, just like anybody who turns on us.
[01:14:36.483 --> 01:14:37.864]  Please come with us, Dr. Kelly.
[01:14:37.884 --> 01:14:38.685]  Well, what's going on?
[01:14:38.725 --> 01:14:39.645]  We need to speak to you.
[01:14:39.665 --> 01:14:40.225]  Right.
[01:14:40.505 --> 01:14:41.686]  The Prime Minister's very angry.
[01:14:41.706 --> 01:14:44.207]  Probably put the hood over him and everything.
[01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:50.170]  But the other two things I wanted to say is that I happen to see Blair being received by the Congress yesterday.
[01:14:50.210 --> 01:14:52.571]  Well, he announced new world order.
[01:14:52.611 --> 01:14:53.532]  No, but the reception.
[01:14:54.013 --> 01:14:57.116]  This is the Congress that's going to investigate weapons of mass destruction.
[01:14:57.136 --> 01:14:59.158]  They received this guy as if he was God.
[01:14:59.979 --> 01:15:00.960]  I mean, it made me so sick.
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:09.889]  Well, the governor of Oceania arrived, and you hear the neocons, the neocon websites are selling t-shirts of Tony Blair.
[01:15:10.129 --> 01:15:10.550]  Oh my God.
[01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:11.591]  The ultimate liberal.
[01:15:11.671 --> 01:15:15.314]  And it's, oh he's so good, oh I love him, oh!
[01:15:15.454 --> 01:15:16.756]  He's booed in his own parliament.
[01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:19.490]  It doesn't matter, not over here.
[01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:21.071]  I mean, my goodness.
[01:15:21.091 --> 01:15:26.912]  But of course it's now come out that while he was here, Mr. Dr. Kelly was dying.
[01:15:28.252 --> 01:15:29.773]  It had been about midnight over there.
[01:15:31.273 --> 01:15:32.113]  What else is on your mind?
[01:15:32.133 --> 01:15:36.234]  Oh, I was just going to say, you were talking about the oil is only one of the issues.
[01:15:36.274 --> 01:15:38.355]  I think the main issue, Alex, is very clear to me.
[01:15:38.935 --> 01:15:40.415]  These people love murder and torture.
[01:15:41.226 --> 01:15:43.027]  Because they're torturing and murdering their own troops.
[01:15:43.107 --> 01:15:43.847]  Their own troops over there.
[01:15:43.867 --> 01:15:46.268]  Their own people are getting... No, they're huffing D.U.
[01:15:46.368 --> 01:15:51.891]  The Army said, God, they said investigate it, quit, and said, yeah, our troops have got rashes and have got it in their blood.
[01:15:51.931 --> 01:15:52.471]  It's horrible.
[01:15:53.326 --> 01:15:58.992]  Bring it on, but whenever the neocon drives along, you just go, bring it on.
[01:15:59.533 --> 01:16:02.115]  Some of their sons die at 25 along cancer.
[01:16:02.336 --> 01:16:08.382]  We know for him as he dies and does his death rattle on the table and say, bring it on.
[01:16:08.982 --> 01:16:12.967]  And you got all these 120 degree weather, they're getting sick, plus the uranium.
[01:16:13.723 --> 01:16:14.664]  They're genociding them.
[01:16:14.724 --> 01:16:15.744]  I mean, that's what they love.
[01:16:15.784 --> 01:16:16.765]  They love the murder and torture.
[01:16:16.785 --> 01:16:18.026]  They always kill our troops.
[01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:21.548]  Agent Orange, Sarin VXDU, last war, don't treat them.
[01:16:21.588 --> 01:16:22.709]  Now admitted they were hit with it.
[01:16:22.949 --> 01:16:23.930]  Government New Day One.
[01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:26.151]  That's how you support the troops.
[01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:28.393]  You, uh, you just use them up.
[01:16:29.513 --> 01:16:32.135]  Don't worry, they'll have a new crowd of young people.
[01:16:32.575 --> 01:16:33.856]  They're gonna have the national draft.
[01:16:34.837 --> 01:16:36.718]  I mean, come on, baby.
[01:16:37.599 --> 01:16:39.420]  There's lots of death to go around.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.921]  We'll take more calls when we get back.
[01:16:45.021 --> 01:16:45.542]  It's here.
[01:16:45.822 --> 01:16:46.522]  It's powerful.
[01:16:46.843 --> 01:16:55.430]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:57.571]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[01:16:57.812 --> 01:16:59.913]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[01:17:00.153 --> 01:17:04.397]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[01:17:04.677 --> 01:17:10.424]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:12.366]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[01:17:12.526 --> 01:17:15.750]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.

[01:18:41.232 --> 01:18:46.115]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a roadmap, and how easy it would be to get lost?
[01:18:46.415 --> 01:18:47.796]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[01:18:47.816 --> 01:18:50.157]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[01:18:50.598 --> 01:18:53.439]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:53.840]  coins.

[01:19:00.964 --> 01:19:02.505]  gold and silver coins.

[01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:40.894]  Federal Reserve.
[01:19:40.974 --> 01:19:43.976]  No more federal than Federal Express, and they have no reserves.
[01:19:44.176 --> 01:19:47.058]  Our once mighty Green Bank is losing more value every day.
[01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:50.400]  Your fortune is dwindling, and your children's future looks even worse.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.062]  It's all a result of the power-hungry Federal Reserve.
[01:19:53.102 --> 01:19:55.664]  The less wealth you have, the more control they have over you.
[01:19:55.884 --> 01:19:57.005]  But what can you do about it?
[01:19:57.105 --> 01:19:59.927]  We're all reliant on their funny money for our daily transactions.
[01:20:00.127 --> 01:20:00.787]  Well, not anymore.
[01:20:00.907 --> 01:20:05.410]  The Liberty Dollar is a silver-backed currency that competes directly with the Fed's fiat currency.
[01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:07.892]  It's inflation-proof and its value is inherent.
[01:20:07.972 --> 01:20:12.295]  Get it at wishgranted.com or call toll-free 1-800-850-8998.
[01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.897]  Now you can escape the greed and control of the Federal Reserve.
[01:20:16.057 --> 01:20:21.701]  Thousands of patriots already have, and that means more honorable businesses are accepting the Liberty Dollar every day.
[01:20:21.841 --> 01:20:23.862]  Go to wishgranted.com or call 800-850-8998.
[01:20:25.703 --> 01:20:30.631]  8998.
[01:20:26.144 --> 01:20:30.631]  That's 800-850-8998 to get your Liberty Dollars today.
[01:20:30.751 --> 01:20:36.540]  With your help, decent Americans can wipe out the Fed and return to currency with real value, just like the Constitution intended.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.985]  Go to wishgranted.com today and free yourself with the Liberty Dollar.
[01:20:50.283 --> 01:21:12.926]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 and then back from 9 to midnight central standard time I do this show and we are about to go to a bottom Los Angeles Ed in Pennsylvania Jim in Texas Ron in New York and many others that are patiently holding the toll-free number to join us on air on this live Friday edition on this pro-family pro-god pro-country pro-border pro-gun
[01:21:14.088 --> 01:21:16.529]  Liberal show, because if you're for all that, you're a liberal.
[01:21:16.569 --> 01:21:18.889]  If you're against all that, you're now a neocon.
[01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:27.591]  Ron Paul's being called liberal now, because he's for lower taxes and smaller government, and he did a big speech about the neocons called Neocon'd.
[01:21:28.192 --> 01:21:30.572]  Well, talk about a powerful speech, although the ultimate threat.
[01:21:32.293 --> 01:21:41.495]  But, uh, we're about to go back to your calls, but I wanted to hit on this story here, because this is Judicial Watch, and no, they're not neocons.
[01:21:42.361 --> 01:21:45.682]  They actually sued Bill Clinton and tried to punish him.
[01:21:45.722 --> 01:21:47.043]  They're not protecting him.
[01:21:47.103 --> 01:21:48.924]  So, again, they're not conservatives.
[01:21:48.944 --> 01:21:49.604]  They're liberals.
[01:21:49.684 --> 01:21:50.765]  They went after Bill Clinton.
[01:21:51.305 --> 01:21:55.387]  They have integrity.
[01:21:55.487 --> 01:21:57.127]  They're pro-Constitution.
[01:21:57.167 --> 01:21:58.888]  That means they're bad.
[01:22:00.489 --> 01:22:04.591]  May even be with the bad people.
[01:22:05.231 --> 01:22:07.872]  But, again, I'm starting to learn the new paradigm here.
[01:22:09.605 --> 01:22:15.450]  Cheney's Energy Task Force documents feature map of Iraq oil fields.
[01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:16.010]  Oh!
[01:22:17.551 --> 01:22:18.072]  Unbelievable!
[01:22:18.112 --> 01:22:21.634]  No wonder Cheney didn't want these to be released, but finally a judge ordered it to happen.
[01:22:22.215 --> 01:22:23.235]  And, of course, it's partisan.
[01:22:23.516 --> 01:22:25.097]  Again, that's why there's separation of powers.
[01:22:25.697 --> 01:22:28.980]  The Founding Fathers knew both sides would be corrupt, so they would fight with each other.
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:33.023]  Gridlock is good, according to the Founding Fathers, not the liberals and neocons.
[01:22:34.272 --> 01:22:39.775]  Commerce and State Department reports the task force detailed oil fields and gas projects, contracts, and exploration.
[01:22:40.816 --> 01:22:48.500]  And they listed oil companies that wanted it, and those just so happened to be the oil companies that got the contracts and gave money to the White House in its election.
[01:22:49.221 --> 01:22:55.985]  Judicial Watch, the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption and abuse, that means they're bad,
[01:22:56.892 --> 01:23:12.021]  And according to the Neocon, said today that documents turned over by the Commerce Department under court order as a result of judicial Washington Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning the activities of Cheney's Energy Task Force contain a map of Iraqi oil fields,
[01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:21.783]  Pipelines, refineries, and terminals, as well as two charts detailing Iraq oil fields, gas projects, and foreign suitors for Iraqi oil field contracts.
[01:23:22.143 --> 01:23:28.164]  The documents, which are dated March 2001, are available on the internet at judicialwatch.org.
[01:23:32.705 --> 01:23:34.705]  Very, very interesting.
[01:23:35.005 --> 01:23:38.346]  Right before September 11th, eyeing the goodies.
[01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:48.950]  And then of course they were eyeing the goodies in 96 and 98 and 99 and 2000 when Dick Cheney, Rumsfeld and others wrote the PENAC documents that are on their own website.
[01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:57.052]  They don't hide them where they say, Saddam's not a threat, quote, we want his oil, great military base, new world order this, new world order that.
[01:23:57.152 --> 01:23:59.112]  Maybe you heard Blair say new world order yesterday.
[01:24:00.133 --> 01:24:05.534]  Tony Blair in the House of Commons subgroup called Congress
[01:24:07.672 --> 01:24:16.083]  So, there you have it, and it goes on and on about how they wanted the oil, but again, you're a liberal if you say that, and the Democrats are using it for partisan aims.
[01:24:16.243 --> 01:24:20.189]  The Democrats all voted for this war, and of course they're using it for partisan aims.
[01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:21.310]  Does that mean it's okay?
[01:24:22.512 --> 01:24:24.234]  I mean, let's say a Republican got caught
[01:24:24.927 --> 01:24:25.747]  Robbing a bank.
[01:24:25.807 --> 01:24:28.708]  Okay, they caught him outside with a black mask on, the bags of money.
[01:24:28.728 --> 01:24:32.649]  Well, they think he was a SWAT team leader and probably give him a... I'm sorry, good people wear ski masks.
[01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:33.569]  Forget the ski mask part.
[01:24:34.449 --> 01:24:35.670]  The use of that was bad, it's good now.
[01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:39.911]  A robber gets caught and it turns out to be a senator and it's a Democrat.
[01:24:39.951 --> 01:24:42.171]  If the Republicans say that's bad, would they be partisan?
[01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:48.053]  Should the guy be let go because the Democrats said it was bad or if it was a Republican or a Democrat, you know, vice versa?
[01:24:48.753 --> 01:24:49.893]  I mean, is a crime a crime?
[01:24:49.933 --> 01:24:50.694]  Is a lie a lie?
[01:24:50.714 --> 01:24:51.694]  Is a fraud a fraud?
[01:24:52.529 --> 01:24:57.432]  Putting our troops in harm's way when we have their own admitted documents saying it's about oil and world government?
[01:24:58.973 --> 01:25:01.074]  They say it's not just about oil, though, and it's true!
[01:25:01.134 --> 01:25:02.134]  It's about world government.
[01:25:02.154 --> 01:25:02.915]  It's about an empire.
[01:25:02.935 --> 01:25:05.897]  It's about everybody being afraid and doing what the globalists say.
[01:25:06.277 --> 01:25:07.117]  Including you!
[01:25:07.578 --> 01:25:09.999]  And they got a national draft ready for your kids!
[01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:14.541]  So don't be an idiot!
[01:25:15.082 --> 01:25:20.505]  Don't have your son or daughter come back with their legs blown off by a landmine for a bunch of dirty bankers!
[01:25:22.822 --> 01:25:23.783]  Don't be part of it!
[01:25:24.423 --> 01:25:34.370]  And don't let the media show you all the dirty hippies promoting the UN who are against the war for all the wrong reasons and then make you use reverse psychology so you support the war.
[01:25:35.571 --> 01:25:45.718]  Those dirty, gun-grabbing, socialistic, un-American, CPS-promoting trash heads are useful idiots and are dangerous.
[01:25:46.494 --> 01:25:58.519]  And they are in the hip pocket of Bush, and all the rest, and John Kerry, Mr. Skull and Bones, and they need to stop being naive, just like the mindless, idiot, neocon followers that are destroying America!
[01:25:58.799 --> 01:26:00.339]  I'm sick of all of you idiots!
[01:26:00.519 --> 01:26:06.902]  You're all part of the establishment, you're all being drug around by your hair, willingly, and I'm sick of it!
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:18.425]  Our whole society's being swallowed by a military-industrial complex that's gonna micromanage our lives, tax the living daylights out of us, take our private property!
[01:26:20.166 --> 01:26:23.188]  And they're gonna double-team us with this New World Order left-right system.
[01:26:25.169 --> 01:26:26.430]  Wake up to that, people!
[01:26:27.411 --> 01:26:29.092]  And boycott the neocons.
[01:26:29.112 --> 01:26:31.193]  We'll be right back with your calls and a bunch of news.
[01:26:33.214 --> 01:26:34.375]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.595 --> 01:26:36.116]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.103 --> 01:26:39.886]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.749 --> 01:26:46.852]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:26:47.132 --> 01:26:50.575]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio is the answer.
[01:26:51.096 --> 01:26:53.738]  Featuring continuous tuning for all shortwave frequencies.
[01:26:53.798 --> 01:26:56.060]  PureTrust.com or PureTrust.net.
[01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:58.002]  That's PureTrust, one word.
[01:26:58.282 --> 01:27:00.744]  PureTrust.com or PureTrust.net.
[01:27:09.055 --> 01:27:13.680]  You see, criminals want control of the organs of government, the judges.
[01:27:20.373 --> 01:27:33.203]  The executive, the intelligence agencies, so they can carry out bigger and bigger scams, bigger and bigger crimes against humanity and legitimize it and legalize it and never be called on the carpet, never be punished.
[01:27:33.744 --> 01:27:37.507]  And so their crimes and their evil just get more and more insane, more and more delusional.
[01:27:37.767 --> 01:27:39.749]  They get on more and more insane power trips.
[01:27:40.792 --> 01:27:41.933]  It's the nature of history.
[01:27:42.373 --> 01:27:57.264]  And you sit there in naive fashion as the most horrible stuff imaginable out of some horrible late night science fiction movie is being made mainstream and manifest and send me emails you won't call in threatening to kill me.
[01:27:57.284 --> 01:27:59.426]  I got this email, I'm gonna come and kill you.
[01:27:59.446 --> 01:28:01.047]  Because you're a liberal.
[01:28:01.928 --> 01:28:03.068]  You ain't for the war.
[01:28:03.649 --> 01:28:07.832]  These people are so dumb, they don't even know I could have a person arrested for what they did.
[01:28:09.216 --> 01:28:09.836]  It's sick!
[01:28:09.976 --> 01:28:11.117]  And I'm sick of you!
[01:28:11.557 --> 01:28:13.538]  And I'm sick of all your half-baked lies!
[01:28:14.178 --> 01:28:15.179]  And just all of it!
[01:28:16.359 --> 01:28:19.241]  I love this country, and I can't stand watching it get butchered!
[01:28:19.781 --> 01:28:22.202]  And our children's future is being flushed down the toilet!
[01:28:23.823 --> 01:28:30.166]  Alright, Michelle in Rhode Island, and Bob in Los Angeles, and Ed in Pennsylvania, and Jim in Texas, and Ron in New York, and many others.
[01:28:30.186 --> 01:28:31.827]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:28:32.667 --> 01:28:34.788]  And yes, there's a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:28:34.808 --> 01:28:36.609]  We've already covered a lot of it though, so stay with us.
[01:28:38.018 --> 01:28:47.984]  Before I go any further though, Herbal Healer Academy folks have been around since 1988 and they give you a free 120 page catalog.
[01:28:48.004 --> 01:28:54.327]  They got vitamins, minerals, books on herbs and oils and stuff naturally occurring in your area.
[01:28:54.347 --> 01:28:58.890]  They have correspondence courses in naturopathic medicine.
[01:28:59.902 --> 01:29:06.503]  D-H-E-A, Cloydal Silver, Growth Hormone, Coral Calcium, Beta, Glucans.
[01:29:07.384 --> 01:29:14.045]  Folks, this catalog is 120 pages, you know, color cover, professionally produced, so well done.
[01:29:14.065 --> 01:29:24.527]  Again, different regions of the country, stuff that grows in your area, natural detox, that is not ridiculously expensive.
[01:29:26.039 --> 01:29:30.260]  Believe me, this is a great source and they're really good people.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:33.461]  Call and get the free catalog and call and get their free newsletter.
[01:29:33.841 --> 01:29:40.042]  Sign up for it online to get them to mail you a free catalog or get their free newsletter online or they'll mail it to you if you don't have a computer.
[01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:42.843]  Both the catalog and the monthly newsletter.
[01:29:43.323 --> 01:29:46.024]  Give them a call right now and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:29:46.044 --> 01:29:47.024]  They're also a great sponsor.
[01:29:47.805 --> 01:29:51.148]  And they're patriots.
[01:29:51.168 --> 01:29:51.548]  870-269-4177.
[01:29:51.568 --> 01:29:52.208]  870-269-4177.
[01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:58.833]  Herbal Healer Academy.
[01:29:59.354 --> 01:30:01.615]  Or go to HerbalHealer.com.
[01:30:01.655 --> 01:30:05.778]  That's H-E-R-B-A-L-Healer.com.
[01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:08.500]  We have a big fat banner on the side of the website.
[01:30:09.121 --> 01:30:10.482]  OnInfoWars.com.
[01:30:10.882 --> 01:30:12.343]  And on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:30:12.363 --> 01:30:13.404]  So, don't wait.
[01:30:13.944 --> 01:30:15.285]  Take control of your life, folks.
[01:30:15.325 --> 01:30:16.026]  That's what we do here.
[01:30:16.670 --> 01:30:29.839]  You know, we tell you to buy guns, we tell you to get on vitamins and liquid vitamins and minerals, we tell you to get good water filters, we tell you to get private property, to get out of debt, you know, just basic simple stuff, folks.
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:38.165]  And this is a good source, a great source for that, 870-269-4177, HerbalHealer.com.
[01:30:39.345 --> 01:30:42.868]  And then last but not least, I have produced nine documentary films.
[01:30:43.797 --> 01:30:53.885]  America Destroyed by Design, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, Police State 3, my newest film, 9-1-1 and the Road to Tyranny, my best film.
[01:30:54.285 --> 01:30:55.486]  Part 2 of that was just excellent.
[01:30:55.506 --> 01:30:56.627]  The Masters of Terror.
[01:30:57.248 --> 01:30:58.088]  They're all excellent.
[01:30:58.108 --> 01:30:59.349]  They're all over 2 hours long.
[01:30:59.389 --> 01:31:02.011]  Police State 3 is 2 hours and 40 minutes.
[01:31:02.152 --> 01:31:04.113]  It's really 3 films in 1.
[01:31:04.453 --> 01:31:04.113]  $25.95.
[01:31:04.874 --> 01:31:09.357]  Order 3 or more of any of my 9 videos and they all drop down to $20 a piece.
[01:31:09.457 --> 01:31:10.118]  Big discount.
[01:31:10.638 --> 01:31:16.646]  And your purchase supports this broadcast, and I authorize you, I beg you, I encourage you to make copies of my videos!
[01:31:17.106 --> 01:31:19.329]  To air them on AXS TV, to get them out to opinion makers.
[01:31:19.930 --> 01:31:21.051]  To make hundreds of copies.
[01:31:21.452 --> 01:31:21.993]  Please!
[01:31:23.134 --> 01:31:27.740]  They're converting, they're unlocking the minds of 90% of those on average that see them.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.302]  Especially Road to Tyranny.
[01:31:29.781 --> 01:31:32.043]  If you haven't gotten my videos, why are you waiting?
[01:31:32.063 --> 01:31:32.544]  888-253-3139.
[01:31:32.604 --> 01:31:33.104]  This is 888-253-3139.
[01:31:33.124 --> 01:31:35.566]  Or prisonplanet.com or net to order.
[01:31:35.646 --> 01:31:38.209]  Again, prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or net.
[01:31:38.749 --> 01:31:39.730]  There's no prisonplanet.net.
[01:31:52.142 --> 01:31:57.128]  PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net to order a VRSecure online shopping cart.
[01:31:57.528 --> 01:31:58.329]  One more time, that's 888-253-3139.
[01:32:03.374 --> 01:32:10.818]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:32:12.258 --> 01:32:16.480]  And all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:18.381]  Why stand you here idle?
[01:32:18.401 --> 01:32:19.602]  The war has already begun.
[01:32:21.083 --> 01:32:23.844]  We are the restorationists against the revolutionaries.
[01:32:24.424 --> 01:32:27.825]  We are trying to restore our Constitutional Republic.
[01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:29.346]  We want America back.
[01:32:29.406 --> 01:32:30.966]  We are the counter-revolutionaries.
[01:32:31.206 --> 01:32:37.608]  We are fighting the enemy combatants that run the halls of Congress and the White House on both sides of the aisle.
[01:32:37.968 --> 01:32:42.550]  We are fighting the technicians of the military-industrial complex that's owned by the private central banks.
[01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:44.730]  We are trying to get America back!
[01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:47.251]  Ladies and gentlemen, join us now!
[01:32:49.039 --> 01:32:51.421]  Somebody tuning in going, man, this guy gets too excited for me.
[01:32:51.741 --> 01:33:01.169]  Why is it normal to yell and scream about a baseball or football game and get so upset and all the mindless details and minutiae, but you know about the Bill of Rights, you're some kind of weirdo.
[01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:02.971]  See how brainwashed you are?
[01:33:02.991 --> 01:33:05.033]  All right, let's go to the calls as promised.
[01:33:05.513 --> 01:33:06.794]  And I forgot to plug this.
[01:33:06.814 --> 01:33:08.796]  We have a new affiliate in Rhode Island.
[01:33:10.117 --> 01:33:10.638]  I want to thank
[01:33:12.346 --> 01:33:14.267]  Mr. Blood there.
[01:33:14.407 --> 01:33:16.987]  They sold their W.A.L.E.
[01:33:17.007 --> 01:33:17.328]  50,000 Water.
[01:33:17.348 --> 01:33:18.308]  We're on another big station.
[01:33:18.848 --> 01:33:20.388]  And now we're on another station in Rhode Island.
[01:33:20.408 --> 01:33:24.710]  I was given this a few weeks ago and never plugged it, but listing out in Rhode Island is Michelle.
[01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:26.070]  Michelle, you're on the air.
[01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:26.510]  Go ahead.
[01:33:26.530 --> 01:33:27.950]  Hi, Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:28.551]  How are you?
[01:33:28.811 --> 01:33:29.091]  Good.
[01:33:29.151 --> 01:33:29.871]  Good to talk to you.
[01:33:30.291 --> 01:33:31.351]  Good to talk to you.
[01:33:31.371 --> 01:33:35.373]  My name is Michelle Freeman and my husband's Ben Freeman and he's on W.A.L.E.
[01:33:35.453 --> 01:33:38.033]  and I just wanted to let you know.
[01:33:38.393 --> 01:33:40.534]  Tell us the call letters and tell us about the station.
[01:33:41.247 --> 01:33:45.411]  It's W-A-R-L Power 1320 and it's Reality Radio.
[01:33:45.431 --> 01:33:47.152]  Oh, what a good name!
[01:33:48.193 --> 01:33:52.337]  And they cover pretty much Providence and up to Attleboro, Massachusetts.
[01:33:52.657 --> 01:33:54.078]  Now where is this based?
[01:33:55.079 --> 01:34:03.187]  It's based in Providence and they're upping their wattage so that they can reach more listeners.
[01:34:03.327 --> 01:34:06.790]  But they already cover most of that state and into Massachusetts.
[01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:07.250]  That's good.
[01:34:08.969 --> 01:34:11.090]  And they're doing a really good job.
[01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:15.491]  They've got Joyce and Dave on in the morning, and then a lot of programs.
[01:34:15.671 --> 01:34:17.191]  Jack Blood's on Saturday.
[01:34:17.391 --> 01:34:21.532]  And I just wanted to ask your permission if I could talk a little bit about my husband's show.
[01:34:21.632 --> 01:34:22.472]  Oh, that's fine.
[01:34:22.592 --> 01:34:23.792]  And when am I on there?
[01:34:24.673 --> 01:34:25.933]  You are on right now.
[01:34:25.953 --> 01:34:26.913]  Well, that's good.
[01:34:26.953 --> 01:34:28.794]  And you're on every day live.
[01:34:28.934 --> 01:34:29.914]  Well, that's exciting.
[01:34:29.934 --> 01:34:33.395]  Folks need to support that station and tell ten people a day about it.
[01:34:33.775 --> 01:34:35.255]  And when is your husband's broadcast on?
[01:34:36.216 --> 01:34:41.097]  He's on Saturday at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and his show is called The Benferno.
[01:34:41.917 --> 01:34:42.797]  The Benferno.
[01:34:42.817 --> 01:34:45.398]  Instead of the Inferno, the Benferno.
[01:34:45.438 --> 01:34:49.039]  So that's 1320, you say, covering Rhode Island.
[01:34:49.499 --> 01:34:52.059]  Yes, and you are his hero.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:57.040]  He's been listening to you for many, many years.
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:01.341]  A friend of his named Steve got him started listening to you about six years ago.
[01:35:01.983 --> 01:35:03.904]  And he didn't believe anything at first.
[01:35:03.944 --> 01:35:06.225]  He just went over there, you know, and hung out and listened.
[01:35:06.305 --> 01:35:11.828]  And he and I got married about two years ago, and he started telling me about the New World Order.
[01:35:11.868 --> 01:35:13.009]  I didn't believe any of it.
[01:35:13.589 --> 01:35:20.633]  And I started looking into it, and I started listening to you and some other people and reading and really researching for myself.
[01:35:20.653 --> 01:35:21.453]  See, that's the thing.
[01:35:21.533 --> 01:35:25.255]  I mean, a couple years ago, though, I can understand how you wouldn't believe it, because the news would say,
[01:35:26.047 --> 01:35:28.208]  Dangerous people talk about a New World Order.
[01:35:28.649 --> 01:35:29.049]  Yeah.
[01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:32.051]  And Blair said New World Order twice in his speech yesterday.
[01:35:32.571 --> 01:35:40.016]  Yeah, and I think that the people... I am a fundraiser for a charity and I talk to people every day and I ask them, do you know what the Patriot Act is?
[01:35:40.036 --> 01:35:42.377]  Do you understand what it's doing to us?
[01:35:42.397 --> 01:35:46.840]  Do you understand that your liberties are at risk here, that they're in jeopardy?
[01:35:47.401 --> 01:35:48.301]  Do you understand this?
[01:35:48.401 --> 01:35:49.062]  And they know.
[01:35:49.422 --> 01:35:50.583]  People know what's going on.
[01:35:52.342 --> 01:35:52.822]  I do.
[01:35:53.363 --> 01:35:54.563]  Oh, I don't know the average.
[01:35:54.803 --> 01:36:19.876]  I mean, I've done now over a thousand interviews since September 11th, and I've been on, you know, syndicated Jeff Rents, it's a friendly audience, and I've been on Ken Hamblin, who's kind of a neo-con, but he's a kind of, he's really a good guy because he jazzed me on and at least lets me talk, and but Pacifica Radio, liberal conservative, and on average, you know, KOA, KFI, I'll take 30 calls, you know, as a guest on
[01:36:20.596 --> 01:36:23.940]  And maybe one person disagrees and they say, I want to kill you.
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:26.904]  You know, it'll be, you should be in jail.
[01:36:27.404 --> 01:36:28.866]  You shouldn't be allowed to talk like this.
[01:36:28.906 --> 01:36:30.908]  And I'm going, well, I'm just reading from a bill here.
[01:36:32.190 --> 01:36:33.992]  So yeah, we're winning the fight.
[01:36:34.052 --> 01:36:35.073]  That's why they're panicking.
[01:36:37.862 --> 01:36:46.190]  I don't remember the guy's name, but he said he was covering for Rush yesterday and I was listening to him talk about the frankenfood and how it's okay because we've been doing it.
[01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:54.519]  We've been genetically mutating food for thousands of years or something under the Mendel, you know, the Mendel the monk.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:00.304]  And a scientist called in and said, no, Mendel did something completely different.
[01:37:01.289 --> 01:37:04.291]  He did hybrids of peas and he let nature take its course.
[01:37:04.311 --> 01:37:07.773]  Look, all that is is hybrids crossing plants, pollinating each other.
[01:37:08.094 --> 01:37:12.377]  It's not putting human genes in tomatoes with cockroach genes.
[01:37:12.617 --> 01:37:18.441]  It's not putting AIDS virus in pharmacological corn and planting it all over Texas and it jumped into soybeans.
[01:37:18.701 --> 01:37:21.503]  Source Associated Press, the stuff has AIDS in it.
[01:37:21.923 --> 01:37:23.424]  You know, this is what I'm saying.
[01:37:23.464 --> 01:37:24.665]  Neocon Radio does this now.
[01:37:25.145 --> 01:37:27.347]  I've heard all of them say... I heard it yesterday.
[01:37:27.367 --> 01:37:28.227]  Hold on, hold on a second.
[01:37:28.407 --> 01:37:29.448]  Michelle, this is important.
[01:37:29.908 --> 01:37:32.791]  I've heard them, and I monitor them, and now they've gotten worse than ever.
[01:37:33.251 --> 01:37:34.092]  They are so evil.
[01:37:35.153 --> 01:37:37.435]  It's like, I call it Nazi radio or something.
[01:37:37.475 --> 01:37:40.638]  They say genetically engineered food is wholesome and good.
[01:37:40.658 --> 01:37:42.040]  You're a lying liberal if you say it's not.
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:47.184]  They say sweatshops are good and are good for children, and the liberals lie about it when the liberals are all for it.
[01:37:47.785 --> 01:37:50.027]  They say a little gun control's good.
[01:37:50.487 --> 01:37:52.289]  It's all an advertisement for evil.
[01:37:52.329 --> 01:37:52.729]  Go ahead.
[01:37:53.250 --> 01:37:55.452]  Yeah, well I saw it in the newspaper too, that
[01:37:55.922 --> 01:38:05.765]  The mainstream media is, you know, sending out this propaganda that the frankenfood is okay for you, and that we're feeding people that are poor with it and everything, and that's a bunch of crap.
[01:38:06.165 --> 01:38:06.425]  It is.
[01:38:06.465 --> 01:38:09.566]  Hey, listen, I appreciate your call, and God bless you.
[01:38:10.567 --> 01:38:24.851]  And for every one of our affiliates, whether it's in Rochester, New York, or in Rhode Island, or Austin, Texas, or Denver, Colorado, or Albuquerque, New Mexico, or, you know, Northern California, Pensacola, Florida,
[01:38:26.103 --> 01:38:29.966]  Tampa, Florida, everywhere we are on the radio.
[01:38:30.286 --> 01:38:33.068]  I am telling you folks, you know this stuff's true.
[01:38:33.128 --> 01:38:34.729]  We document everything we talk about.
[01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:37.710]  It's right out there in the open, from a bill, from a news story.
[01:38:38.611 --> 01:38:40.272]  And we're fighting for America.
[01:38:40.392 --> 01:38:46.055]  Please tell ten people a day about the AM or FM affiliate you listen to.
[01:38:47.716 --> 01:38:48.577]  Please do it.
[01:38:49.612 --> 01:38:52.774]  And I can't say anything for other shows, but I can say for mine.
[01:38:53.274 --> 01:38:54.415]  We're not an infomercial.
[01:38:54.815 --> 01:38:56.496]  I talk about things I really believe in.
[01:38:57.557 --> 01:38:58.837]  We don't compromise.
[01:38:59.278 --> 01:39:00.839]  We talk about real information.
[01:39:00.859 --> 01:39:03.840]  What I tell you is the best understanding I have.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.081]  We do this in a fearless fashion.
[01:39:06.502 --> 01:39:11.665]  I know we can win this thing, but you've got to tell ten people a day about Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:11.965 --> 01:39:14.046]  Let's say you're listening to us on AM or FM in your area.
[01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:19.854]  You know, Fredericksburg, Texas, or Kerrville, Texas, or wherever.
[01:39:21.215 --> 01:39:22.596]  Or North Texas.
[01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:29.382]  And you're listening to us, but your family in New Jersey or California or Oklahoma doesn't have an affiliate.
[01:39:29.822 --> 01:39:30.663]  They got a computer.
[01:39:30.843 --> 01:39:32.845]  Infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[01:39:34.861 --> 01:39:35.401]  Shortwave.
[01:39:35.562 --> 01:39:37.963]  You know, a lot of people got a shortwave, or you should get one.
[01:39:38.423 --> 01:39:39.944]  Listen to all six hours of the show.
[01:39:39.964 --> 01:39:40.645]  11 to 2.
[01:39:41.085 --> 01:39:41.545]  Every day.
[01:39:41.605 --> 01:39:41.965]  Central.
[01:39:41.985 --> 01:39:41.965]  12.172.
[01:39:42.666 --> 01:39:45.428]  93.20.
[01:39:42.786 --> 01:39:45.428]  At night.
[01:39:45.868 --> 01:39:47.229]  9 to midnight.
[01:39:47.509 --> 01:39:47.229]  5.085.
[01:39:47.529 --> 01:39:49.070]  68.90.
[01:39:48.349 --> 01:39:49.070]  Tell people.
[01:39:49.130 --> 01:39:50.251]  Grassroots power.
[01:39:50.711 --> 01:39:52.472]  That's why with my films, I say make copies.
[01:39:52.552 --> 01:39:53.132]  It's powerful.
[01:39:53.152 --> 01:39:54.573]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:39:54.713 --> 01:39:56.094]  Let's talk to Bob in Los Angeles.
[01:39:56.134 --> 01:39:56.755]  Bob, go ahead.
[01:39:57.775 --> 01:39:59.336]  Good afternoon, Alex Jones.
[01:39:59.456 --> 01:40:00.217]  I'm Bob Jones.
[01:40:01.155 --> 01:40:01.896]  I'm from L.A.
[01:40:01.957 --> 01:40:04.541]  and I'd like to say the Night of the Long Knives has begun.
[01:40:04.561 --> 01:40:07.946]  It's going to be a feeding frenzy of the hyenas.
[01:40:07.966 --> 01:40:11.072]  They're going to eat each other, trying to protect each other.
[01:40:13.318 --> 01:40:15.799]  You're just looking back at... Well, Bob, number one, do me a favor.
[01:40:15.859 --> 01:40:16.759]  This is out of control.
[01:40:16.799 --> 01:40:18.139]  The listener's giving their last names.
[01:40:18.159 --> 01:40:18.859]  Just don't do it.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:19.560]  Oh, okay.
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:21.980]  Because you could call in and say you were somebody else, and you really weren't.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.361]  Now, I'm going to have to cut people off, but I do.
[01:40:23.381 --> 01:40:26.341]  I'm not mad at people, but it's like two in a row.
[01:40:26.361 --> 01:40:27.381]  This is getting out of control.
[01:40:27.742 --> 01:40:28.162]  Oh, okay.
[01:40:28.262 --> 01:40:28.462]  No, no.
[01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:29.722]  It's okay, but hold on just a second.
[01:40:29.762 --> 01:40:30.282]  Hold on just a second.
[01:40:30.702 --> 01:40:31.162]  Hold on just a second.
[01:40:31.983 --> 01:40:34.783]  For those who don't know what neither of the Long Knives is, tell them and then go ahead.
[01:40:36.044 --> 01:40:36.444]  Okay.
[01:40:36.924 --> 01:40:41.865]  So, I mean, you're looking back at Vince Foster and Ron Brown and Mary Mulhaney there.
[01:40:42.532 --> 01:40:45.835]  What happens when you step in the face of these farm mongers?
[01:40:48.017 --> 01:40:53.122]  I myself, like you, have fought against the government as far as the identity issues.
[01:40:53.662 --> 01:41:03.310]  I fought against Los Angeles Police Department, got rid of my social security number, revoked my social security number, driver's license, did all that, and I ended up spending two and a half years in a county jail.
[01:41:03.831 --> 01:41:09.516]  And they said in the court that they had to punish me extraordinarily because I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:41:10.615 --> 01:41:11.816]  They said that in open court.
[01:41:12.336 --> 01:41:19.302]  The FBI argued in Denver last year, Denver Post, that the Constitution is not admissible and has connections to terrorists.
[01:41:20.543 --> 01:41:24.066]  Well, the Constitution is their contract not to violate our rights.
[01:41:24.726 --> 01:41:26.688]  And they're saying that.
[01:41:26.728 --> 01:41:28.169]  They're saying that they're open office.
[01:41:28.209 --> 01:41:30.651]  Well, I have female on tape saying it's a terrorist document.
[01:41:30.671 --> 01:41:31.732]  I'm going to have it on video.
[01:41:32.873 --> 01:41:34.114]  This is what they teach police.
[01:41:34.975 --> 01:41:39.558]  You remember the days of the Towers and Feathers and the Scalding Tea and the Hangings?
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.401]  It is inviting upon themselves.
[01:41:43.382 --> 01:41:45.264]  I think you should submit to whatever tyranny.
[01:41:45.884 --> 01:41:48.466]  I think that it was wrong that blacks stood up against slavery.
[01:41:49.467 --> 01:41:52.910]  I think that it was wrong that some of the Jews fought back in Nazi Germany.
[01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:56.492]  I don't think we have a right to fight back against tyranny.
[01:41:57.093 --> 01:41:58.734]  So I'm going to take the mainstream view here.
[01:41:58.834 --> 01:41:59.635]  I think you should grovel.
[01:42:00.330 --> 01:42:06.112]  I think if a cop wants to rape your wife, or take your house, or come over and order you to mow their lawn, I think you should do it.
[01:42:06.312 --> 01:42:10.294]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic here, illustrating evil by pointing it out.
[01:42:10.414 --> 01:42:22.798]  Of course, I think what Hitler did was wrong, and slavery was wrong, but no, they say you will submit to them, you will accept whatever corruption, but for those who don't know, neither Long Knives was killing Jenst, Rome, and
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:24.620]  The S.A.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:51.507]  that helped bring the Hitler and his S.S., the Brownshirts, it was killing off the Brownshirts, the street thugs, the lower-level idiot criminals that helped them, and that's always the group that's greatest, greatest, you know, feeding frenzies on, but I don't want to say that Dr. David Kelly, he's an honorable man, had a good record, blew the whistle on Blair lying, that Blair knew the documents were fake, and a day after going before the Parliament, he was found dead in a field.
[01:42:52.369 --> 01:42:53.269]  Well, one more point.
[01:42:53.309 --> 01:42:58.572]  You know, I was looking at Bush and the Prime Minister of England walking together.
[01:42:58.592 --> 01:43:01.373]  They look like two gay guys prancing in the woods.
[01:43:01.473 --> 01:43:02.794]  I mean, what's up with that?
[01:43:02.814 --> 01:43:05.335]  They look like they're in love with each other.
[01:43:05.355 --> 01:43:07.176]  Well, they are in love with each other.
[01:43:07.536 --> 01:43:09.497]  Should be down here in West Hollywood working it.
[01:43:10.198 --> 01:43:13.559]  Anyways, I'm sorry for the shock news here, so thanks a lot.
[01:43:13.839 --> 01:43:14.920]  Alright, thank you.
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.081]  Please, we have a family audience here.
[01:43:18.642 --> 01:43:23.485]  Uh, that's what they do at Skull and Bones, though, according to MSNBC and USA Today.
[01:43:23.505 --> 01:43:27.487]  And according to Washington Times, what they bus in at Bohemian Grove.
[01:43:27.507 --> 01:43:28.667]  But hey, that's conservatism.
[01:43:29.047 --> 01:43:30.268]  And I'm pro-gun, I'm a liberal.
[01:43:32.449 --> 01:43:33.690]  It's all too insane!
[01:43:33.710 --> 01:43:37.792]  Oh my goodness, I don't know about him and Blair, though.
[01:43:38.650 --> 01:43:38.990]  I don't know.
[01:43:39.451 --> 01:43:41.913]  He's just a puppet, though.
[01:43:42.453 --> 01:43:43.874]  I shouldn't even talk about Bush.
[01:43:43.914 --> 01:43:46.496]  He's not running anything.
[01:43:47.156 --> 01:43:49.138]  I'm sure if he asks his daddy for something, he can get it, though.
[01:43:49.798 --> 01:43:51.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ed in Pennsylvania.
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:52.580]  Ed, you're on the air.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.021]  Go ahead.
[01:43:53.421 --> 01:43:53.801]  Hey, Alex.
[01:43:54.302 --> 01:43:54.842]  Welcome, sir.
[01:43:55.983 --> 01:44:01.027]  Kelly's a good Irish name, so they probably said you should have kept your mouth shut, Mick, before they killed him.
[01:44:01.667 --> 01:44:02.768]  Yeah, probably did, yeah.
[01:44:04.813 --> 01:44:05.454]  See, I'm behind 57.
[01:44:06.374 --> 01:44:13.781]  I'm Welch, and Irish, and Scottish, and Comanche, so... Same here, brother.
[01:44:13.801 --> 01:44:14.661]  Big news today.
[01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:17.964]  They keep talking about Iran with this enriched uranium.
[01:44:18.204 --> 01:44:20.066]  They're pushing that real big on the news right now.
[01:44:21.006 --> 01:44:22.087]  Oh, it's good for you.
[01:44:22.127 --> 01:44:24.269]  In fact, they suggest you eat it with your Wheaties.
[01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:28.353]  Good excuse for us to go over there and start some trouble.
[01:44:29.714 --> 01:44:31.495]  And England, they've got to put some more cameras in.
[01:44:31.515 --> 01:44:33.617]  They could have caught these guys killing this poor doctor, you know?
[01:44:34.466 --> 01:44:34.866]  Oh, yes.
[01:44:34.906 --> 01:44:36.246]  They have them in the fields now.
[01:44:36.386 --> 01:44:38.667]  The cameras that analyze movements, of course.
[01:44:38.687 --> 01:44:45.488]  Of course, I'm sure the police officers will have their images taken out of the database, so... Anything else you'd like to add there, Ed?
[01:44:45.508 --> 01:44:46.729]  Uh, did you see the Terminator yet?
[01:44:47.429 --> 01:44:47.709]  Uh, no.
[01:44:47.769 --> 01:44:48.889]  Is it New World War propaganda?
[01:44:49.449 --> 01:44:52.750]  Uh, it was, you know, robots for crowd control.
[01:44:52.810 --> 01:44:54.850]  I'll tell you what I want to see is King Conan.
[01:44:55.891 --> 01:44:57.151]  You know, they're gonna make another Conan.
[01:44:57.371 --> 01:44:58.171]  Oh, I didn't hear about that.
[01:44:58.211 --> 01:44:59.451]  Yeah, I will go see that.
[01:44:59.571 --> 01:45:00.672]  I like the first Conan.
[01:45:01.392 --> 01:45:02.112]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:02.172 --> 01:45:02.572]  Stay with us.
[01:45:04.019 --> 01:45:14.103]  Homeowners, if you're drowning in high-interest credit card debt, or have been turned down for credit elsewhere, grab a pen and get ready to jot down a toll-free number, because the credit people have got some great news for you.

[01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:28.209]  Slow credit?
[01:45:28.329 --> 01:45:28.850]  Bad credit?
[01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:29.470]  No problem!

[01:45:54.939 --> 01:45:55.140]  That's 1-866-510-3328.
[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:55.781]  The credit people.
[01:45:55.801 --> 01:45:56.503]  High interest in people.
[01:45:56.523 --> 01:45:57.445]  Low interest on loans.
[01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:09.973]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:46:10.313 --> 01:46:14.415]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:46:14.695 --> 01:46:15.236]  We listened.
[01:46:15.556 --> 01:46:20.539]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:46:20.819 --> 01:46:21.299]  We listened.
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:24.721]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:46:25.162 --> 01:46:25.662]  We listened.
[01:46:26.122 --> 01:46:30.206]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:46:30.566 --> 01:46:31.067]  We listened.
[01:46:31.407 --> 01:46:36.651]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:46:37.072 --> 01:46:38.433]  Again, we listened.
[01:46:38.793 --> 01:46:46.180]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.023]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:46:59.628 --> 01:47:08.152]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:08.332 --> 01:47:12.775]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:12.895 --> 01:47:17.277]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[01:47:17.397 --> 01:47:18.658]  A New World Order.
[01:47:19.438 --> 01:47:20.398]  Panama.
[01:47:20.459 --> 01:47:24.680]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:31.683]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:47:31.803 --> 01:47:33.904]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:34.164 --> 01:47:44.608]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:47:44.808 --> 01:47:46.949]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[01:47:47.329 --> 01:47:48.569]  This is my new two and a half hour video.
[01:47:48.589 --> 01:47:50.210]  Police Day 3 is for you!
[01:47:50.670 --> 01:47:53.331]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:47:53.431 --> 01:47:54.591]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:47:54.611 --> 01:47:55.071]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:47:55.131 --> 01:47:56.852]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:48:13.471 --> 01:48:21.379]  Yeah, they probably did say something insulting to this Irish doctor who worked in the government to the highest levels and exposed Blair's lying.
[01:48:21.399 --> 01:48:23.701]  If he was Irish, he probably did.
[01:48:24.502 --> 01:48:25.423]  Again, I'm a high 57.
[01:48:25.603 --> 01:48:28.907]  My mom's side of the family is German.
[01:48:28.927 --> 01:48:30.609]  They're Alsatian, that's French German.
[01:48:31.670 --> 01:48:32.330]  Southern Germany.
[01:48:36.107 --> 01:48:39.409]  And then some other German, and then on my dad's side is the Heinz 57.
[01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:49.616]  Quite a bit of Comanche, and then Welch, of course, Jones, and Irish, and Scottish, and all that good stuff.
[01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:52.738]  But over in England, they have no problem killing the Irish.
[01:48:53.839 --> 01:48:58.823]  In fact, MI6 and MI5 have been caught quite a few times blowing stuff up and blaming it on the Irish.
[01:48:58.863 --> 01:49:00.324]  That's, by the way, been in all their big papers.
[01:49:00.924 --> 01:49:02.265]  So that's the type of folks we're talking about.
[01:49:02.285 --> 01:49:04.667]  They'll blow up a school bus full of kids, I mean.
[01:49:06.192 --> 01:49:07.173]  There's a lot they'll do.
[01:49:07.193 --> 01:49:10.096]  And that's an interesting story.
[01:49:10.156 --> 01:49:11.737]  I'm sad that Mr. Kelly's dead.
[01:49:13.779 --> 01:49:22.807]  We're about to go to Jim and Ron and David and who was that in Idaho?
[01:49:23.848 --> 01:49:24.689]  Dan, you say?
[01:49:25.658 --> 01:49:29.160]  Dan and others, but what I want to do now is everybody be patient.
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:31.462]  I'll just get to you straight your calls the next hour.
[01:49:31.502 --> 01:49:39.687]  It's about four and a half minutes away because I want to go ahead and blitz through some news I didn't get to and then I'll get into more detail on it the next hour if we take calls.
[01:49:41.368 --> 01:49:49.313]  Just recapping, Cheney Energy Task Force had maps of who was going to get the oil in Iraq and where all the oil fields were before September 11th.
[01:49:49.473 --> 01:49:51.234]  You talk about planning, they did a lot of planning.
[01:49:52.543 --> 01:49:53.804]  No wonder they didn't want this to be released.
[01:49:54.804 --> 01:49:59.907]  Look for another attack real quick to smoke screen this so the serial killers can pose as our saviors.
[01:50:00.628 --> 01:50:02.169]  I'm sad for those that are going to die.
[01:50:02.509 --> 01:50:03.350]  I wish they wouldn't do it.
[01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:05.251]  We're trying to stop them right now here on the air.
[01:50:05.291 --> 01:50:06.872]  Putting our lives on the line doing it, by the way.
[01:50:07.932 --> 01:50:11.194]  Iraq uranium forgeries crudely done.
[01:50:11.374 --> 01:50:13.676]  Newspaper reveals.
[01:50:14.897 --> 01:50:16.578]  That's right, my friends.
[01:50:17.398 --> 01:50:20.380]  Iraq uranium forgeries crudely done.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.061]  Newspaper reveals.
[01:50:23.385 --> 01:50:26.529]  And it turns out that it was a first bar of government and totally fake.
[01:50:26.889 --> 01:50:33.937]  Walmart is claiming that they are not going to put chips in the clothes and the shoes, but it turns out that's not true.
[01:50:33.957 --> 01:50:35.558]  They're just putting them in the goods right now.
[01:50:35.618 --> 01:50:37.661]  They won't track you yet, they claim.
[01:50:38.261 --> 01:50:39.082]  Again, this is a tactic.
[01:50:39.102 --> 01:50:42.786]  When they get caught doing something, they say, OK, we're not going to do it for five minutes.
[01:50:42.806 --> 01:50:44.408]  And then they're back five minutes later.
[01:50:45.633 --> 01:50:57.461]  Senator Graham, out of Florida, who, by the way, was involved in the Intelligence Committee's meeting with the heads of Al Qaeda and others, and that's Associated Press, by the way, is now playing good cop, saying that Bush should be impeached.
[01:50:57.481 --> 01:51:00.363]  Democrat eyes potential grounds for Bush impeachment.
[01:51:00.383 --> 01:51:01.323]  More on that coming up.
[01:51:02.444 --> 01:51:03.185]  But it's all staged.
[01:51:04.145 --> 01:51:08.088]  Also, again, I want to read some of Tony Blair's speech where he called for a New World Order and then said,
[01:51:09.051 --> 01:51:11.013]  Uh, the New World must have order.
[01:51:11.193 --> 01:51:11.694]  Ha ha.
[01:51:12.094 --> 01:51:13.455]  Nice little play on words there.
[01:51:13.876 --> 01:51:16.198]  Also the German cannibal homosexual ring.
[01:51:16.218 --> 01:51:22.183]  Uh, with 400 plus people involved and people donating themselves to be slaughtered and butchered and eaten.
[01:51:23.744 --> 01:51:28.609]  But I think that's deviant, but of course I could be arrested according to hate crimes laws under the EU for saying that.
[01:51:29.412 --> 01:51:30.533]  These cults are deviant.
[01:51:31.373 --> 01:51:32.774]  But that's BBC.
[01:51:32.834 --> 01:51:33.735]  You might have heard about it.
[01:51:33.895 --> 01:51:35.456]  And the scientists to clone a mammoth.
[01:51:35.496 --> 01:51:36.176]  It's official.
[01:51:36.737 --> 01:51:38.398]  Also on sale in Taiwan.
[01:51:38.538 --> 01:51:40.359]  Fish that have been crossed with jellyfish.
[01:51:40.919 --> 01:51:42.040]  Again, it's like Blade Runner.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:42.920]  It's here, folks.
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:44.962]  But there's all this genetic engineering.
[01:51:45.022 --> 01:51:48.904]  It's just like crossing two corn species like they did thousands of years ago.
[01:51:49.594 --> 01:51:56.077]  You know, cockroach genes in your tomatoes, and in goats that are spliced with spiders that produce body armor out of their udders.
[01:51:56.637 --> 01:51:58.478]  That's all no big deal, the neocons say.
[01:51:58.518 --> 01:52:06.962]  And I've even heard the neocons on the air saying, sweatshops are really pretty good, and it gives the kids an opportunity, and it's not as bad as the liberals say.
[01:52:08.908 --> 01:52:09.928]  The gun control's good.
[01:52:09.948 --> 01:52:11.329]  The liberals are against it.
[01:52:11.369 --> 01:52:12.629]  See, I actually heard conservatives now.
[01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:16.050]  You know, these liberals are saying Bush is an anti-gun.
[01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:19.351]  That's a sneaky lie they've put out.
[01:52:20.732 --> 01:52:22.292]  Taiwan shopkeepers unveil.
[01:52:22.472 --> 01:52:23.452]  Frankenfish!
[01:52:23.552 --> 01:52:25.353]  Yes, all the scenic engineering.
[01:52:25.413 --> 01:52:26.713]  It's just all natural.
[01:52:26.833 --> 01:52:27.614]  It's good for you.
[01:52:28.214 --> 01:52:29.714]  Star Lake corn was good for you, too.
[01:52:29.734 --> 01:52:31.175]  It didn't cause allergic reactions.
[01:52:31.235 --> 01:52:34.416]  And of course, the pigs wouldn't eat it.
[01:52:34.476 --> 01:52:35.696]  But it's still good for you.
[01:52:36.956 --> 01:52:37.317]  Animals.
[01:52:37.377 --> 01:52:38.497]  Barnyard animals won't eat it.
[01:52:39.582 --> 01:52:40.523]  But it's good for you.
[01:52:42.024 --> 01:52:43.345]  That's what Neocon Radio is now.
[01:52:43.425 --> 01:52:43.926]  I can't believe them.
[01:52:44.246 --> 01:52:45.267]  Sweat shops are good.
[01:52:45.327 --> 01:52:46.107]  Torture's good.
[01:52:46.408 --> 01:52:47.789]  Patriot Act doesn't take your rights.
[01:52:48.409 --> 01:52:49.810]  Bunch of other news coming up.
[01:52:49.890 --> 01:52:50.871]  It's a big third hour.
[01:52:50.891 --> 01:52:51.292]  Stay with us.
[01:53:09.309 --> 01:53:12.531]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:20.056 --> 01:53:20.716]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.377 --> 01:53:22.437]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:23.138 --> 01:53:24.278]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.298 --> 01:53:25.739]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.420]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.983]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.223 --> 01:53:36.306]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:38.746 --> 01:53:40.007]  It's Friday.
[01:53:40.027 --> 01:53:48.714]  We've got a bunch of vital news coming up about genetic engineering and how deadly it is, but the media is telling you how good it is.
[01:53:50.656 --> 01:53:53.438]  Radiation of school children's meat, they say it's wonderful.
[01:53:53.538 --> 01:53:55.400]  DU is not bad for the fruits either.
[01:53:56.178 --> 01:53:57.399]  Agent Orange is good for you, too.
[01:53:58.260 --> 01:54:05.024]  Oh, I have a Times of London article I didn't get to last week where they apologize and admit that the California eugenics model was actually used by Adolf Hitler.
[01:54:05.044 --> 01:54:06.045]  They consulted with him.
[01:54:06.486 --> 01:54:08.327]  But this is the loving liberals that want to run your life.
[01:54:09.688 --> 01:54:12.029]  Again, neo-con-liberal, whatever you want to call them.
[01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:13.290]  Government pimps.
[01:54:14.231 --> 01:54:16.253]  Evil control freaks breeding you like cattle.
[01:54:17.073 --> 01:54:17.934]  That's all coming up.
[01:54:18.014 --> 01:54:23.077]  More on the British doctor-scientist who was high-level in the Ministry of Defense.
[01:54:23.898 --> 01:54:25.039]  Exposed the cover-ups.
[01:54:26.599 --> 01:54:38.887]  By Blair of the false evidence of weapons of mass destruction, he ended up dead last night after being threatened and being quote mistreated, the BBC said, because he was one of the leakers.
[01:54:40.468 --> 01:54:42.269]  He's leaking, but in other ways.
[01:54:42.289 --> 01:54:44.510]  Of course, the government won't say how he died.
[01:54:44.590 --> 01:54:45.931]  I'm sure the family will be told to shut up.
[01:54:45.991 --> 01:54:47.592]  It'll never come out how he died, or maybe it will.
[01:54:47.612 --> 01:54:47.912]  I don't know.
[01:54:48.473 --> 01:54:49.373]  We got loaded phones.
[01:54:49.393 --> 01:54:50.214]  We're about to go to
[01:54:51.275 --> 01:54:58.362]  Jim and Ron and Dan and Dan and Rob and a bunch of other people.
[01:54:58.742 --> 01:54:59.663]  Or David, excuse me.
[01:55:00.344 --> 01:55:02.426]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Texas.
[01:55:02.466 --> 01:55:03.206]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:55:03.266 --> 01:55:03.667]  Go ahead.
[01:55:04.387 --> 01:55:05.789]  Greetings from Cowtown, Alex.
[01:55:06.189 --> 01:55:07.410]  Oh, you're up in Fort Worth.
[01:55:07.530 --> 01:55:07.951]  Fort Worth.
[01:55:08.892 --> 01:55:10.193]  Hey, listen, Alex.
[01:55:10.814 --> 01:55:15.418]  We respect your opinion and I need one from you on some information I found.
[01:55:16.388 --> 01:55:22.410]  At a website a couple of days ago, it's stanley2002.org.
[01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:28.893]  Are you familiar with Rick Stanley, his mutual defense pact militia?
[01:55:29.593 --> 01:55:32.834]  Did you know he's issued a preliminary militia alert?
[01:55:33.934 --> 01:55:41.037]  And last but not least, don't we have an obligation to protect our like-minded friends?
[01:55:42.970 --> 01:55:45.452]  I don't know of this Stanley individual.
[01:55:45.512 --> 01:55:46.293]  Is he in Texas?
[01:55:46.753 --> 01:55:47.573]  Uh, he's in Denver.
[01:55:49.855 --> 01:55:52.477]  Um, actually I've heard that name somewhere.
[01:55:52.717 --> 01:55:58.241]  Is he the guy that went to the Capitol arm and got arrested?
[01:55:58.541 --> 01:55:59.482]  That's it, that's it.
[01:55:59.562 --> 01:56:02.824]  Yeah, he's making the point that we don't have a Second Amendment.
[01:56:02.844 --> 01:56:09.049]  He just said to the news, I'm going to go with a gun, holstered, I have this right, and you watch I'm going to get arrested, and he did.
[01:56:09.904 --> 01:56:13.687]  And then the FBI said in that case, quote, the Constitution can't be argued.
[01:56:13.727 --> 01:56:15.469]  That was one of the deals.
[01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:18.571]  And I don't know what he's calling for.
[01:56:18.952 --> 01:56:21.374]  I need to get him on the show.
[01:56:22.014 --> 01:56:22.955]  But I'll tell you this.
[01:56:23.215 --> 01:56:27.039]  The government uses things like this to make us all look rabid and wild-eyed.
[01:56:27.059 --> 01:56:28.059]  I'm not saying he is.
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:34.385]  And I have to tell you, I don't know if he's saying he has a militia, but the problem is good people go join the militia.
[01:56:34.465 --> 01:56:38.088]  Every man who's of age, you know, what is it, 18 to 50-something, is in the militia.
[01:56:39.272 --> 01:56:43.058]  The Swiss out there haven't demonized it, and they have the lowest crime rate in the world, period.
[01:56:43.078 --> 01:56:44.760]  I'm not against the militia.
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:50.609]  The problem is, is that, you know, if you swung a stick in the dark at a militia meeting, you'd hit ten FBI agents.
[01:56:51.209 --> 01:56:52.892]  And they're there provocateuring.
[01:56:54.131 --> 01:56:55.291]  They will call for violence.
[01:56:55.331 --> 01:56:58.452]  It's like Dr. Charles T. Sell up in St.
[01:56:58.492 --> 01:56:58.773]  Louis.
[01:56:58.813 --> 01:56:59.653]  He was an Army doctor.
[01:56:59.693 --> 01:57:01.774]  They called in to do the medical records of the Davidians.
[01:57:02.394 --> 01:57:04.875]  Beforehand, he said the feds killed him.
[01:57:05.255 --> 01:57:06.595]  Suddenly they go, he's crazy.
[01:57:06.615 --> 01:57:08.616]  They grab him, force drug him for six years.
[01:57:09.136 --> 01:57:10.656]  Most of it in solitary confinement.
[01:57:10.696 --> 01:57:15.078]  And their excuse was he went to a shooting range with an FBI agent and said some threats.
[01:57:15.698 --> 01:57:18.119]  They never charge him for that, but it's what they do.
[01:57:18.139 --> 01:57:19.339]  So I'm just warning people to be careful.
[01:57:19.599 --> 01:57:22.120]  That's why this is about violence in an offensive manner.
[01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:26.321]  I say I'll defend my family, but I don't wish any harm against any of these petty bureaucrats.
[01:57:26.481 --> 01:57:30.822]  I want to wake them up, and I want to expose them as criminals, and we can't do that.
[01:57:31.282 --> 01:57:37.624]  And I want to educate the general population, because if people go off into some violent modes, the government's just going to point and go, oh, look, they're terrorists.
[01:57:37.884 --> 01:57:38.964]  We've got to take your guns.
[01:57:39.224 --> 01:57:43.426]  The government has to blow up its own buildings to try to make us look bad.
[01:57:45.473 --> 01:57:47.615]  They get power out of this at this point.
[01:57:47.975 --> 01:57:49.456]  We're still in the educational phase.
[01:57:49.476 --> 01:57:50.277]  You got any comments on that?
[01:57:51.498 --> 01:57:52.479]  You're exactly right.
[01:57:53.139 --> 01:57:57.342]  All I can say is, I'd suggest checking out his website, stanley2002.org.
[01:57:57.382 --> 01:58:00.265]  There's a ton of good information there.
[01:58:01.546 --> 01:58:04.448]  I think he's got some good ideas, just trying to decide what to do with it.
[01:58:04.828 --> 01:58:06.009]  Absolutely, thanks for the call.
[01:58:07.590 --> 01:58:13.355]  And I would advise people, I mean anybody that smiles at you when you're having a beer and talks about violence, they're a dirty fat.
[01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:23.614]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:58:23.874 --> 01:58:28.216]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:58:28.516 --> 01:58:37.440]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:41.262]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:58:41.542 --> 01:58:46.588]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:58:46.868 --> 01:58:53.616]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:58:54.096 --> 01:58:54.637]  What about you?
[01:58:55.393 --> 01:59:00.740]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:59:14.916 --> 01:59:19.261]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:19.442 --> 01:59:23.867]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:24.007 --> 01:59:28.392]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:59:28.432 --> 01:59:29.774]  The New World Order.
[01:59:30.558 --> 01:59:31.499]  Panama.
[01:59:31.559 --> 01:59:35.782]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:35.842 --> 01:59:42.767]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:42.907 --> 01:59:44.989]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:45.289 --> 01:59:55.677]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:55.917 --> 01:59:58.439]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my
[01:59:58.439 --> 01:59:59.680]  This is my new two and a half hour video.

[02:01:19.988 --> 02:01:20.649]  Big Brother.
[02:01:21.289 --> 02:01:22.390]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:23.070 --> 02:01:24.271]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:24.831 --> 02:01:25.672]  You want answers?
[02:01:26.392 --> 02:01:27.313]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:27.973 --> 02:01:31.655]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:32.155 --> 02:01:36.278]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:39.122 --> 02:01:46.228]  The British doctor, the scientist, he was high level in the British government and he blew the whistle on Tony Blair manufacturing evidence and lying.
[02:01:47.369 --> 02:01:48.630]  Turned up dead last night.
[02:01:48.650 --> 02:01:49.490]  They found him today.
[02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:51.292]  They're already billing it.
[02:01:51.332 --> 02:01:52.433]  They won't say how he died.
[02:01:52.453 --> 02:01:54.374]  Won't anybody see the body or get near it.
[02:01:55.895 --> 02:01:59.158]  The BBC has the headline, David Kelly tragedy.
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:02.501]  He just never came home from work.
[02:02:02.521 --> 02:02:03.101]  He disappeared.
[02:02:03.141 --> 02:02:05.323]  He had been threatened by the government and was, quote, being mistreated.
[02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:11.906]  Blowing the whistle, and they were threatening him that he could be violating national security, exposing our lives, and so he ends up dead.
[02:02:11.946 --> 02:02:13.107]  Oh, it's a tragedy!
[02:02:15.627 --> 02:02:16.947]  It's a tragedy!
[02:02:17.928 --> 02:02:24.489]  And then Tony Blair, there in our Congress yesterday, saying, New World Order, New World Order, New International Order, New International Order.
[02:02:25.009 --> 02:02:28.290]  You know, somebody else has said New World Order there in four State of the Union addresses.
[02:02:28.979 --> 02:02:43.984]  And I got him on tape saying he's called George Herbert Walker, blue blood, skull and bones, Kenny Buckport, Maine, phony Texan CIA director, UN ambassador, first ambassador to China, only family allowed to get contracts with Kissinger and others through China.
[02:02:45.924 --> 02:02:46.784]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:02:46.904 --> 02:02:48.345]  Okay, let's go back to the call.
[02:02:48.365 --> 02:02:49.945]  A lot of callers, a lot of news coming up.
[02:02:50.185 --> 02:02:51.506]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[02:02:51.566 --> 02:02:52.266]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:02:52.306 --> 02:02:52.666]  Go ahead.
[02:02:52.906 --> 02:02:53.346]  Hi, Alex.
[02:02:53.847 --> 02:02:55.247]  Talk about a big brother system.
[02:02:55.982 --> 02:03:00.745]  In New York, we have, and it's commonly known, a very well-developed subway system.
[02:03:00.845 --> 02:03:03.147]  It moves two to three million people per day.
[02:03:03.667 --> 02:03:03.988]  Okay?
[02:03:04.648 --> 02:03:10.392]  You no longer can use cash or purchase a metal, simple metal token to get into that system now.
[02:03:10.972 --> 02:03:17.837]  Everybody is forced to purchase what they call a MetroCard, which essentially is a credit card for the purchase of traveling in that system.
[02:03:18.357 --> 02:03:23.401]  Well, every time you purchase one of those cards, each card has its own individual serialized number.
[02:03:23.962 --> 02:03:28.409]  When you purchase the card, your photograph is taken, and the serialized number is correct.
[02:03:35.219 --> 02:04:01.140]  Where you have entered that subway system, what station you have entered, time and day, and if they really want to find out... I read about this, but off the digital photo, they already have the cameras, and they admit, DARPA admits two weeks ago, this is the Pentagon, all the cameras are being hooked into face scanning software as a, quote, military control grid over the U.S., and now when you go to Target or any of these places, they're making it where even when the clerk swipes it, the machine keeps your card.
[02:04:01.929 --> 02:04:02.229]  I think so.
[02:04:17.817 --> 02:04:23.784]  That five airports have put brain scanners in, this is CBS News folks, that scan the brain waves.
[02:04:23.864 --> 02:04:26.326]  I mean, it's total insanity!
[02:04:26.466 --> 02:04:27.347]  It is insane.
[02:04:27.387 --> 02:04:30.190]  Most people are ignorant of this fact, you know, here in the city of New York.
[02:04:30.250 --> 02:04:32.493]  As I said, two to three million people use that system per day.
[02:04:32.913 --> 02:04:39.160]  They got you photographed with the serialized card number, so when you swipe and go in the system, if they really want to find out, you know,
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:56.868]  And by the way, the New York Post reported yesterday, we had the family on, she's got a 3.84, 3.8+, 15, graduating with her bachelor's from college, and the father said that CPS is threatening to take her from the family.
[02:04:56.908 --> 02:05:02.590]  They say it is abusive, she must go to public school, and they're not going to let her have her college diploma.
[02:05:02.911 --> 02:05:05.812]  They're blocking that, and they're talking about indictments.
[02:05:06.873 --> 02:05:15.742]  Your borders wide open, the police have been ordered to squeeze the people, they're scanning your faces, foreign troops are being brought in, and 15 year old girls may be taken from their family.
[02:05:15.762 --> 02:05:18.405]  Doesn't that sound like freedom to you?
[02:05:19.206 --> 02:05:20.187]  Oh yeah, real freedom.
[02:05:20.207 --> 02:05:27.835]  As a matter of fact, right now the city of New York is conducting a minor experiment, well I shouldn't say minor, it is putting microchips
[02:05:28.422 --> 02:05:37.633]  In the employee identification cards of at least its police officers, which are close to 30,000 or 40,000 in number, and maybe even some of the other civil agencies.
[02:05:38.094 --> 02:05:40.076]  And my feeling is, if that thing works out...
[02:05:45.803 --> 02:05:46.203]  We're good to go.
[02:06:06.067 --> 02:06:13.830]  And I come to the counter, and there's this kid behind the counter, and he gets the card, and he says, you know, Alex Jones, Magnolia Management.
[02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:14.930]  He goes, what's Magnolia Management?
[02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:16.631]  I go, just some name, some proprietorship.
[02:06:17.091 --> 02:06:20.072]  Came up with it, because, you know, we got magnolia trees around my grandma's house.
[02:06:20.112 --> 02:06:22.813]  My dad had the idea, you know, eight years ago or whatever.
[02:06:22.853 --> 02:06:25.974]  And he goes, he goes, well, what is it?
[02:06:26.374 --> 02:06:27.935]  And I said, well, a business.
[02:06:28.735 --> 02:06:30.116]  And he goes, I need to know what this is.
[02:06:30.136 --> 02:06:31.216]  And he has three times.
[02:06:31.236 --> 02:06:32.557]  And I said, well, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:32.777 --> 02:06:33.537]  I have a radio show.
[02:06:34.105 --> 02:06:35.126]  And you have a business.
[02:06:35.146 --> 02:06:37.127]  The name of your company is Magnolia Management.
[02:06:37.207 --> 02:06:38.488]  What further does it require?
[02:06:38.708 --> 02:06:39.789]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:06:40.269 --> 02:06:42.110]  And he didn't even need to know that.
[02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:43.171]  It's my name on the card.
[02:06:44.132 --> 02:06:48.134]  And so he goes, I'm going to have to call this in.
[02:06:48.694 --> 02:06:49.295]  He walks over.
[02:06:49.315 --> 02:06:53.978]  When he comes back, and he's real rude and throws it down, I go, this is not a third world country.
[02:06:54.058 --> 02:06:55.279]  I know this is a police state.
[02:06:55.639 --> 02:06:56.319]  I'm sick of it.
[02:06:56.339 --> 02:06:57.200]  I want your manager.
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:06:59.702]  And I go, this is Gestapo tactics.
[02:06:59.762 --> 02:07:03.364]  And then some lady behind me goes, that's insulting!
[02:07:03.948 --> 02:07:06.530]  And I go, no, you being trained to do this is insulting.
[02:07:06.791 --> 02:07:08.793]  The manager comes out and he goes, oh, Alex Jones.
[02:07:08.813 --> 02:07:09.153]  And I go, yeah.
[02:07:09.173 --> 02:07:10.034]  And he goes, oh, I'm a fan.
[02:07:10.314 --> 02:07:10.714]  I'm sorry.
[02:07:10.754 --> 02:07:12.576]  We just have to do this now.
[02:07:12.596 --> 02:07:15.639]  But Alex, do what?
[02:07:15.679 --> 02:07:17.040]  There's nothing more to be explained.
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:18.001]  It's all about questioning.
[02:07:18.021 --> 02:07:21.444]  It's all about, well, I shouldn't be shopping at OfficeMax.
[02:07:21.464 --> 02:07:29.291]  Remember, they're the ones that said that they would, quote, watch what you print and copy and wouldn't allow anti-war stuff to be at their own copy centers.
[02:07:29.311 --> 02:07:29.712]  Remember that?
[02:07:30.416 --> 02:07:30.596]  What?
[02:07:30.776 --> 02:07:31.636]  It was OfficeMax?
[02:07:31.716 --> 02:07:33.877]  I heard that, but I wasn't sure what company that was.
[02:07:33.917 --> 02:07:34.937]  That was OfficeMax, yeah.
[02:07:34.957 --> 02:07:36.397]  See, but I forget this.
[02:07:36.697 --> 02:07:40.818]  You know, Target pays for face scanning cameras in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where they're based.
[02:07:41.038 --> 02:07:42.479]  AP, last week.
[02:07:42.539 --> 02:07:46.240]  Walmart, with the Defense Department and Target, and a secret microchip plant.
[02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:47.400]  Source, AP.
[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:50.921]  OfficeMax spying on you.
[02:07:50.981 --> 02:07:51.881]  Kinko's, Taylor.
[02:07:52.441 --> 02:07:53.581]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[02:07:53.601 --> 02:07:57.382]  Keep in mind with those chips, not only can they tell your, not only could they tell,
[02:07:58.058 --> 02:07:58.859]  Your purchases.
[02:07:58.919 --> 02:08:05.907]  But listen, if they really wanted to, right, with global positioning, they could actually track you moving in live time.
[02:08:05.947 --> 02:08:10.132]  If you're moving down Broadway... Sir, the RFIDs already do that and I have reports on it today.
[02:08:10.192 --> 02:08:10.873]  Thanks for the call.
[02:08:11.013 --> 02:08:12.415]  And Alex, one last thing.
[02:08:13.076 --> 02:08:13.216]  Alex.
[02:08:13.737 --> 02:08:14.317]  Yes, yes.
[02:08:14.917 --> 02:08:19.259]  Was it Patrick Henry that said, give me a microchip or give me death?
[02:08:19.519 --> 02:08:20.420]  Isn't that what they were all about?
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:21.920]  He said, give me security or give me death.
[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:25.682]  He said, give me police in black ski masks ordering me around or give me death.
[02:08:25.862 --> 02:08:26.862]  That's what I thought he said.
[02:08:26.882 --> 02:08:28.423]  He said, give me welfare or give me death.
[02:08:28.483 --> 02:08:29.823]  He said, exactly.
[02:08:29.843 --> 02:08:30.984]  He said, standing up was wrong.
[02:08:31.004 --> 02:08:31.584]  Thanks for the call.
[02:08:32.465 --> 02:08:35.486]  He was an extremist terrorist and I'm glad I have FEMA on tape saying it.
[02:08:35.866 --> 02:08:36.366]  I do, I do.
[02:08:36.466 --> 02:08:40.828]  I have FEMA on tape saying the Founding Fathers are evil, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin.
[02:08:41.528 --> 02:08:43.509]  I have them saying all Christians are enemies of the government.
[02:08:44.449 --> 02:08:47.050]  I have this under official Bush administration training, okay?
[02:08:47.710 --> 02:08:49.070]  And he's so Christian.
[02:08:50.050 --> 02:08:52.011]  See, they're going to pay off your Baptist churches.
[02:08:52.031 --> 02:08:55.731]  The big Baptist church in Austin has anti-gun days, UN days now.
[02:08:55.751 --> 02:08:59.092]  I mean, it's just, I love Jesus, they say.
[02:08:59.172 --> 02:09:00.312]  I worship the UN.
[02:09:00.712 --> 02:09:03.173]  Jesus loved the UN.
[02:09:03.233 --> 02:09:04.293]  I mean, it's blasphemous.
[02:09:06.173 --> 02:09:07.514]  This is the new America, folks.
[02:09:08.294 --> 02:09:13.475]  Mindless, socialist control freaks that are so braindead, they're the conservatives.
[02:09:15.402 --> 02:09:19.886]  And they tell real freedom lovers, real Christians, real conservatives, that we're bad.
[02:09:19.906 --> 02:09:24.709]  I mean, you are pathetic, mindless jellyfish out there!
[02:09:24.729 --> 02:09:27.692]  You need to wake up, neocons, and you too, you stupid liberals.
[02:09:27.772 --> 02:09:29.273]  I'm really tired of all you.
[02:09:29.773 --> 02:09:30.894]  You're like, hey, don't be so mean.
[02:09:30.954 --> 02:09:35.998]  Well, look, it's like your house is on fire, and I'm trying to wake you up from a deep sleep.
[02:09:36.058 --> 02:09:38.841]  I may have to, you know, throw some water on you or slap you.
[02:09:39.481 --> 02:09:40.542]  Wake up, people!
[02:09:41.653 --> 02:09:42.414]  Read history!
[02:09:42.514 --> 02:09:43.575]  It's happening again!
[02:09:44.016 --> 02:09:45.277]  With a high-tech overlay!
[02:09:46.238 --> 02:09:52.145]  Alright, David in Illinois, and then Dan and Rob and Frank and everybody else.
[02:09:53.186 --> 02:09:54.627]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:09:55.508 --> 02:09:56.309]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:09:56.609 --> 02:09:57.110]  How you doing?
[02:09:57.731 --> 02:10:00.654]  I caught your interview with Ann Coulter the other night on shortwave.
[02:10:01.917 --> 02:10:09.121]  Yeah, if you really listen to her, well, gun control, you know, Bush has got to do it, and UNESCO, he's got to do it, and I was mad.
[02:10:09.381 --> 02:10:13.404]  She got more mad at me than she does at the liberal, because the liberal's really her little buddy.
[02:10:13.484 --> 02:10:14.484]  Wink, wink, see?
[02:10:15.425 --> 02:10:20.007]  Well, the liberals don't argue using pertinent facts.
[02:10:20.508 --> 02:10:23.529]  They engage in the party warfare distraction.
[02:10:23.870 --> 02:10:25.891]  Emotional chicken wing flapping.
[02:10:26.791 --> 02:10:31.154]  That's correct, and so what I want to do is encourage you to put that interview
[02:10:32.134 --> 02:10:53.808]  on your next video uh... and maybe do a brief segment on how the uh... media celebrities are uh... participating in this uh... party warfare distraction you know i'm gonna is that your word your term yes it is well i i'm i'm going to uh...
[02:10:54.730 --> 02:10:59.635]  I think one of our columnists for Prison Planet should write an article called Party Warfare Destruction.
[02:10:59.715 --> 02:11:02.998]  I think I'm co-opting that word now at this time.
[02:11:03.018 --> 02:11:04.259]  It's mine.
[02:11:04.279 --> 02:11:07.502]  But that is something else.
[02:11:07.602 --> 02:11:09.003]  Party Warfare Destruction.
[02:11:09.464 --> 02:11:19.453]  Well, it keeps the argument at a certain level and it filters out a lot of the pertinent... Did you hear my story last hour, David, where I
[02:11:21.164 --> 02:11:26.207]  I was doing errands for like three hours yesterday, and I'd get back in the car, and I'd turn the car, and every time it was Hillary Clinton.
[02:11:27.048 --> 02:11:28.288]  And then I'd flip channels.
[02:11:28.328 --> 02:11:28.949]  Hillary Clinton.
[02:11:29.209 --> 02:11:29.409]  Right.
[02:11:29.909 --> 02:11:30.790]  Well, who cares?
[02:11:31.190 --> 02:11:35.253]  Yes, we know that a walking latrine is in the Senate.
[02:11:35.773 --> 02:11:37.174]  There are a bunch of evil people there.
[02:11:37.454 --> 02:11:39.876]  But it's all about, we're good because we're against her.
[02:11:40.276 --> 02:11:46.800]  That's right, and this keeps the argument centered on labels, liberals versus conservatives.
[02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:48.421]  Nobody can define that.
[02:11:50.464 --> 02:11:51.384]  Look at Tony Blair!
[02:11:51.444 --> 02:11:55.665]  He's the most socialistic creature known to be able to get policies through.
[02:11:55.685 --> 02:12:04.207]  Anti-gun, anti-sovereignty, enslaving cameras, secret arrest, have you thought, speech crime, they have it there now.
[02:12:04.847 --> 02:12:07.967]  They arrested a big TV presenter for saying the word homosexual.
[02:12:07.987 --> 02:12:08.748]  That's not allowed now.
[02:12:08.808 --> 02:12:10.148]  All the articles say gay, gay, gay.
[02:12:10.428 --> 02:12:14.109]  I don't think they can do that in Canada either.
[02:12:14.169 --> 02:12:15.749]  I think it's called something like
[02:12:16.852 --> 02:12:19.834]  Attacking identifiable groups or something like that.
[02:12:19.854 --> 02:12:20.254]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:12:20.314 --> 02:12:23.096]  But my point is, even a dictionary is illegal now.
[02:12:23.176 --> 02:12:26.698]  And the point is, there are conservative websites.
[02:12:26.738 --> 02:12:27.919]  We all know who they are, folks.
[02:12:28.539 --> 02:12:30.200]  The ones that sell the Ronald Reagan caps.
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:33.182]  And they'll promote Tony Blair.
[02:12:33.202 --> 02:12:36.184]  I know another conservative site that sells Tony Blair t-shirts.
[02:12:38.835 --> 02:12:39.475]  I'm speechless.
[02:12:39.735 --> 02:12:54.640]  Well, the reason I'm mentioning this and the reason I called is because once I heard that interview and you really left her speechless, the only thing she could do was start trying to debunk you by using things like black helicopters and throwing the nut label around.
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:57.961]  But if you could maybe construct
[02:12:59.082 --> 02:13:02.886]  You know, show that interview and then construct a small segment in your next film.
[02:13:02.926 --> 02:13:07.070]  Show documents over... Yeah, I'll tell you what, stay there and we'll talk about it.
[02:13:07.190 --> 02:13:07.971]  It is a good idea.
[02:13:09.372 --> 02:13:10.033]  It is a good idea.
[02:13:10.113 --> 02:13:12.495]  Mark, we haven't got rid of that interview yet.
[02:13:12.515 --> 02:13:13.576]  We need to save that.
[02:13:13.596 --> 02:13:14.337]  It's very important.
[02:13:16.815 --> 02:13:21.317]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:13:21.677 --> 02:13:25.759]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:13:26.059 --> 02:13:26.600]  We listened.
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:31.902]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:13:32.162 --> 02:13:32.663]  We listened.
[02:13:33.043 --> 02:13:36.064]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:13:36.504 --> 02:13:37.045]  We listened.
[02:13:37.505 --> 02:13:39.906]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping.
[02:13:39.926 --> 02:13:40.486]  I think so.

[02:15:19.831 --> 02:15:21.211]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[02:15:21.231 --> 02:15:23.572]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[02:15:24.013 --> 02:15:26.834]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[02:15:26.894 --> 02:15:27.234]  coins.
[02:15:27.494 --> 02:15:28.755]  The Redbook Guide to U.S.

[02:16:13.522 --> 02:16:22.026]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick, and you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[02:16:22.306 --> 02:16:27.588]  You haven't alkalized your body, and in fact you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[02:16:27.828 --> 02:16:36.132]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella, the two most important protein superfoods known.
[02:16:36.432 --> 02:16:39.013]  Finally, you don't consume iodized water.
[02:16:39.313 --> 02:16:46.676]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[02:16:46.956 --> 02:16:51.078]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.

[02:17:10.507 --> 02:17:12.888]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer!
[02:17:27.472 --> 02:17:30.415]  All right, we're back live.
[02:17:30.495 --> 02:17:38.523]  Tony Blair, the poster child, the mascot of the neocons.
[02:17:38.583 --> 02:17:41.627]  I mean, he's... The guy's a communist, folks.
[02:17:41.667 --> 02:17:50.916]  The guy is so anti-Western civilization, Magna Carta, Bill of Rights, you know, Western Europe.
[02:17:50.956 --> 02:17:51.637]  It's a joke!
[02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:54.591]  And, again, neocons love him.
[02:17:54.871 --> 02:17:56.192]  This is a guy who loved Bill Clinton.
[02:17:56.212 --> 02:17:58.033]  See, it shows how phony it is.
[02:17:58.073 --> 02:17:59.014]  It's only on the surface.
[02:17:59.754 --> 02:18:02.456]  David Illinois was making some great points, and I was interrupting him, of course.
[02:18:02.476 --> 02:18:03.716]  That's my hallmark.
[02:18:04.337 --> 02:18:10.941]  But, yes, continuing with the Ann Coulter interview, people have actually said that, and I thought of it instinctively.
[02:18:10.981 --> 02:18:13.122]  Great minds think alike with our native intelligence.
[02:18:13.857 --> 02:18:15.800]  Yeah, I'll probably take ten minutes of that.
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:17.662]  I need to ask for a copy of it.
[02:18:17.702 --> 02:18:19.504]  Mark, will you burn me a copy of that and mail it to me?
[02:18:20.085 --> 02:18:21.587]  I'm so busy.
[02:18:22.248 --> 02:18:22.629]  Who knows?
[02:18:22.829 --> 02:18:24.070]  I'm just telling the folks around the show.
[02:18:24.090 --> 02:18:28.035]  One of the points that I'd certainly stress is that you were mentioning main
[02:18:28.894 --> 02:18:33.056]  Mainstream media sources on these stories, and she was unaware of those.
[02:18:33.436 --> 02:18:37.739]  Well, she said, she said, in my book, we expose that the Patriot Act doesn't take rights, not liberals.
[02:18:37.759 --> 02:18:38.079]  Why?
[02:18:38.399 --> 02:18:39.480]  Now, that's a chapter of her book.
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:40.160]  I've got it right here.
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:41.121]  And she had never read it.
[02:18:41.481 --> 02:18:43.762]  And then I said, well, you know about the subsection?
[02:18:43.782 --> 02:18:44.462]  She goes, I never read it.
[02:18:44.542 --> 02:18:45.563]  I go, well, what about the Patriot Act?
[02:18:45.603 --> 02:18:46.043]  Never read it.
[02:18:46.944 --> 02:18:50.065]  And I said, well, would you like me to read a subsection?
[02:18:50.186 --> 02:18:50.566]  No.
[02:18:51.866 --> 02:18:52.747]  That's boring.
[02:18:54.082 --> 02:18:55.643]  Well, and that's a tip-off right there.
[02:18:55.663 --> 02:18:57.824]  She sounded like a liberal!
[02:18:57.844 --> 02:18:59.544]  That's what they sound like!
[02:18:59.825 --> 02:19:00.725]  Well, they're all the same.
[02:19:01.405 --> 02:19:01.805]  That's it!
[02:19:01.945 --> 02:19:04.347]  And that's why there's no difference between the parties anymore.
[02:19:05.807 --> 02:19:07.168]  If there ever was in the first place.
[02:19:07.208 --> 02:19:08.829]  You know, I'm not sure that there ever was.
[02:19:08.909 --> 02:19:09.429]  And think of her.
[02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:11.710]  That lady made like twenty-something million off one book.
[02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:14.711]  I mean, I don't care if people make money.
[02:19:14.871 --> 02:19:16.052]  That's what happens to these...
[02:19:17.236 --> 02:19:24.540]  System-coronated media celebrities, though, they do make a lot of money, as you were offered a million, I think.
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:25.220]  You turned it down.
[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:28.662]  We'll see if you'd have gone with the plan, you'd have been a rich guy now.
[02:19:29.303 --> 02:19:30.143]  Well, you know what?
[02:19:31.304 --> 02:19:33.045]  I don't want all the blood on my hands.
[02:19:34.245 --> 02:19:37.747]  I know it, and that's... I'm going to go here, but one more point.
[02:19:39.988 --> 02:19:40.709]  We've got these
[02:19:41.601 --> 02:19:53.591]  Media standouts out there, they have been coronated by the system, and they're out there offering this distraction, keeping everybody focused on party, liberal, conservative, when nobody can really define what those things are.
[02:19:54.211 --> 02:19:57.374]  But if you listen to Limbaugh and Hannity,
[02:19:58.087 --> 02:20:00.689]  And the problem is liberal.
[02:20:00.749 --> 02:20:01.810]  The problem is Democrat.
[02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:03.471]  And they took the money, boy, didn't they?
[02:20:03.811 --> 02:20:04.351]  They sure did.
[02:20:05.512 --> 02:20:10.655]  They took $279 million for a 10-year contract.
[02:20:10.735 --> 02:20:11.456]  Nine-year contract.
[02:20:11.776 --> 02:20:11.956]  Right.
[02:20:13.357 --> 02:20:16.639]  So keep up the good work, Alex.
[02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:18.200]  Absolutely.
[02:20:18.220 --> 02:20:18.900]  Thanks for the call.
[02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:25.604]  And then all the little talk show hosts, the little neocon clones that are making like $15 an hour,
[02:20:27.648 --> 02:20:28.909]  That's what they get paid here locally.
[02:20:28.929 --> 02:20:44.018]  If they're lucky, they just regurgitate and beg and plead and just try to get that syndicated job and just try to break in so they can be with one of the big three or four networks so they can do it and they can care less.
[02:20:44.298 --> 02:20:46.479]  And these guys and gals aren't stupid, by the way.
[02:20:46.779 --> 02:20:48.660]  They know they're slipping America's throat.
[02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:49.721]  They know what they're doing.
[02:20:50.538 --> 02:20:58.240]  And all their little, good old boy, next door acts, and, oh, thank you so much for the call, and all that sweet act.
[02:20:58.420 --> 02:21:00.020]  The call irritates me, I'll let them know.
[02:21:01.361 --> 02:21:04.581]  I'm an arable person, you know, I don't put on acts here.
[02:21:05.562 --> 02:21:08.802]  And, uh, it was so easy, that's what I'm proud of.
[02:21:08.822 --> 02:21:13.323]  They offered a million bucks, and that was just starting in the first year, folks.
[02:21:13.363 --> 02:21:15.704]  They wanted me to be the big, aggressive, you know,
[02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:20.853]  Shock jock slash, you know, new wave conservatism.
[02:21:22.414 --> 02:21:23.615]  And I mean, there was the contract.
[02:21:23.655 --> 02:21:25.276]  It was so easy to say no.
[02:21:26.156 --> 02:21:28.938]  And the average person would kill their mother for a million bucks.
[02:21:29.338 --> 02:21:31.120]  And I'm not even saying I'm that good of a person.
[02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:33.641]  I mean, I'm a person who's got a temper.
[02:21:35.082 --> 02:21:37.224]  I am somebody who does get envious.
[02:21:38.364 --> 02:21:40.526]  But not like other people I know.
[02:21:40.546 --> 02:21:41.967]  I mean, I've got problems.
[02:21:43.321 --> 02:21:44.362]  I could be really mean.
[02:21:45.743 --> 02:21:46.864]  I'm an aggressive person.
[02:21:46.884 --> 02:21:52.448]  I have a lot of testosterone, but to take a million dollars to sell people out?
[02:21:52.488 --> 02:21:54.650]  I mean, it just, it does not compute.
[02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:57.572]  But see, that's how America used to be, folks.
[02:21:57.592 --> 02:22:00.094]  95% of people were like that.
[02:22:00.174 --> 02:22:01.315]  Now it's 5% that aren't.
[02:22:01.335 --> 02:22:04.658]  That's how upside down things are.
[02:22:06.979 --> 02:22:09.061]  And I mean, they told me, they said, what's wrong with the New World Order?
[02:22:09.101 --> 02:22:11.603]  I mean, I ought to tell that story and we're to tell sometime.
[02:22:13.268 --> 02:22:17.209]  Let's talk to Dan in Idaho.
[02:22:17.229 --> 02:22:17.769]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:22:17.789 --> 02:22:18.189]  You're on the air.
[02:22:18.849 --> 02:22:21.650]  Yeah, Alex, this is Dan in North Central Panhandle, Idaho.
[02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:23.991]  All right, we'll probably have to hold you over, but go ahead.
[02:22:24.471 --> 02:22:27.731]  Yeah, we thank you very much for your work, and thanks for having me on.
[02:22:28.872 --> 02:22:34.873]  We've circulated your tapes up here in this part of the country, and I've shipped some to Portland and California to relatives.
[02:22:35.233 --> 02:22:37.174]  They're excellent, and we appreciate your work.
[02:22:38.374 --> 02:22:42.735]  What I've got is a request, Alex, and I would ask you to consider this.
[02:22:44.125 --> 02:22:46.186]  Would you report more on our own?
[02:22:46.366 --> 02:22:48.228]  What's happening to our own guys out here?
[02:22:48.568 --> 02:22:51.650]  Guys that are awake.
[02:22:51.811 --> 02:22:55.453]  Oh, how they're shooting and killing patriots and taking your farms and ranches.
[02:22:55.754 --> 02:22:57.075]  Like Scott Woodring.
[02:22:57.135 --> 02:22:58.376]  Nobody's reporting on him.
[02:22:58.416 --> 02:23:01.018]  I picked it up on the intel report from Nancy Farnsley.
[02:23:01.098 --> 02:23:02.139]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:23:02.159 --> 02:23:03.279]  Stay there and you can tell us about it.
[02:23:03.299 --> 02:23:04.600]  We've talked about it about 15 times.
[02:23:04.821 --> 02:23:05.761]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.222 --> 02:23:07.823]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:08.744 --> 02:23:11.446]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.783 --> 02:23:21.909]  Hello everybody, my name is Bob Barefoot and I'm here today to introduce Bob Barefoot's Best Coil Calcium Supreme Plus.
[02:23:22.089 --> 02:23:26.334]  It has twice as much of the high-grade Marine Coil Calcium from Okinawa.
[02:23:26.354 --> 02:23:26.414]  877-605-9200.
[02:23:26.474 --> 02:23:26.894]  That's 877-605-9200.
[02:23:49.930 --> 02:23:52.172]  Alright folks, this is Real Talk Radio.
[02:23:52.212 --> 02:23:55.135]  We talk about real issues that actually affect you and your family.
[02:23:56.456 --> 02:24:04.202]  Not issues of little or no significance or mindless chicken fights, gladiatorial diversions between Tom Daschle and George Bush.
[02:24:05.848 --> 02:24:07.969]  Now there is a huge stack of vital news.
[02:24:08.009 --> 02:24:09.130]  I'm going to blitz through here.
[02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:18.354]  I'm only taking three more calls from Dan and Rob and Frank and maybe a few others.
[02:24:19.134 --> 02:24:21.295]  Then I'm going to jump into news for the balance of the show.
[02:24:21.315 --> 02:24:23.916]  We've got about 26 minutes left right now.
[02:24:23.936 --> 02:24:30.920]  I want to remind the listeners, my website is rprisonplanet.com, infowars.com and infowars.net.
[02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:31.720]  Please spread the word.
[02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:40.894]  Dan, up there in Idaho, you say, talk about what's happening to us, the patriots.
[02:24:41.075 --> 02:24:43.096]  I mean, I do, but I talk about what happens to
[02:24:44.341 --> 02:24:51.423]  To a 15-year-old young woman who's graduating from college with honors, and the CPS is trying to take her from her family.
[02:24:51.463 --> 02:24:57.345]  I talk about how the SWAT team goes in and kills some, you know, innocent patriot.
[02:24:57.805 --> 02:24:59.065]  There's so many crimes.
[02:24:59.365 --> 02:25:00.986]  They're doing it to everybody, though.
[02:25:01.686 --> 02:25:03.547]  And I'm attempting to wake everybody up.
[02:25:03.687 --> 02:25:08.908]  And yes, I do talk about these issues, but you're welcome to talk about them again.
[02:25:08.928 --> 02:25:10.449]  Go ahead.
[02:25:11.428 --> 02:25:12.329]  Well, I thank you, Alex.
[02:25:12.529 --> 02:25:13.189]  And I know you do.
[02:25:13.229 --> 02:25:14.830]  And that was a good piece on that young girl.
[02:25:15.130 --> 02:25:19.613]  And it's a good example of our federal learning institutions, if you will.
[02:25:20.874 --> 02:25:23.795]  Scott Woodring, and I'm just picking up bits and pieces.
[02:25:23.836 --> 02:25:24.736]  I don't have a computer.
[02:25:24.796 --> 02:25:28.378]  I had to call Jack McLean, my neighbor the other day, and get a little bit from him.
[02:25:29.119 --> 02:25:34.442]  But he was evidently a chaplain in the Michigan militia.
[02:25:35.402 --> 02:25:40.584]  And they falsely charged him with sexual charges and ultimately murdered him and burned his house down.
[02:25:49.691 --> 02:25:51.052]  And it's dangerous, too.
[02:25:51.092 --> 02:25:56.035]  You shouldn't let your 14-year-old girls go out there dressed like hookers, and that's what the style is.
[02:25:56.095 --> 02:25:57.436]  And they've been in the news.
[02:25:57.776 --> 02:26:02.720]  They've gotten in trouble marketing lingerie to 8-year-olds.
[02:26:02.780 --> 02:26:03.580]  It's been in the news.
[02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:08.763]  He says this, then they come and SWAT team him and they kill him, and it's horrible.
[02:26:10.064 --> 02:26:11.345]  So this is the new America.
[02:26:12.286 --> 02:26:14.687]  I understand yesterday was his funeral.
[02:26:17.065 --> 02:26:22.126]  I would ask all the brothers to pray for him and his widow and children he left behind.
[02:26:23.907 --> 02:26:26.888]  They're picking us off out here in Idaho also.
[02:26:27.388 --> 02:26:31.589]  Oh man, they arrest you there for speech according to the Associated Press.
[02:26:32.069 --> 02:26:33.789]  Yes sir.
[02:26:34.690 --> 02:26:37.771]  I don't want to call black people names or Hispanics or whites or anybody else.
[02:26:37.791 --> 02:26:43.252]  We're all together in this fight against tyranny, but a black man in front of a whole football stadium attacked a news reporter
[02:26:44.232 --> 02:26:53.156]  And called her names, and called the white man names, and when the white man called him a name back, and the police admitted it, they arrested him for calling him a racial epithet back.
[02:26:53.936 --> 02:27:00.278]  And you've got quite a, they know there's good people out there, so they're attacking you out there, and they're grabbing your land.
[02:27:00.298 --> 02:27:01.719]  It's happening everywhere.
[02:27:02.459 --> 02:27:06.501]  I know it is, Alex, and we're in sad shape, and I appreciate, again, the work you're doing.
[02:27:07.001 --> 02:27:08.702]  But I would again make that request.
[02:27:08.742 --> 02:27:11.903]  We've got a pastor, John Lewis, out of Campbellsburg, Indiana, that
[02:27:16.371 --> 02:27:28.374]  You know, I got the pastor's number and I dropped the ball and didn't get him on.
[02:27:28.394 --> 02:27:29.254]  I'm going to call Pastor Butch.
[02:27:29.334 --> 02:27:29.935]  I'm going to get him on.
[02:27:30.215 --> 02:27:38.617]  Yeah, they were protesting at the city park on public land, First Amendment, and they came up and beat people up and then charged them with assault.
[02:27:38.677 --> 02:27:41.278]  Now the cops are in trouble because the video shows no assault.
[02:27:41.738 --> 02:27:42.038]  That's right.
[02:27:42.577 --> 02:27:42.977]  That's right.
[02:27:44.078 --> 02:27:45.419]  And we've got other things going on.
[02:27:45.439 --> 02:27:47.160]  You know, these health food places.
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:49.062]  We had one out here called Waterhouse.
[02:27:49.142 --> 02:27:55.566]  Dave Hinkson's in prison down in Boise for standing against the FDA and all the other agencies.
[02:27:55.586 --> 02:27:56.387]  They've sicced on him.
[02:27:57.028 --> 02:28:00.750]  We've got Larry Roggis that's up north in Wallace, Idaho.
[02:28:01.551 --> 02:28:09.957]  He'll be sentenced to several years in prison for teaching the Constitution and organizing an unincorporated posse.
[02:28:11.856 --> 02:28:16.778]  Well, I'll tell you what happens, and I've read the documents years ago from Idaho and into Texas and everywhere else.
[02:28:18.119 --> 02:28:26.483]  Even small departments get a federal grant to bring in somebody who's really a fed, generally for the sheriff's department or the city police.
[02:28:27.244 --> 02:28:31.686]  And his job is to go around and quote, find militias and slash terrorists.
[02:28:32.404 --> 02:28:35.287]  Or gun violators, and they'll go undercover.
[02:28:35.807 --> 02:28:37.589]  They'll go to a bar if they have to.
[02:28:37.769 --> 02:28:39.510]  There won't even be a militia in the town.
[02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:40.992]  This happened with the Viper militia.
[02:28:41.012 --> 02:28:42.373]  It was a motorcycle gang.
[02:28:42.393 --> 02:28:45.436]  FBI goes in with informants and an agent.
[02:28:45.956 --> 02:28:47.097]  Says, hey, I got all this money.
[02:28:47.117 --> 02:28:50.520]  Let's start selling guns, not just methamphetamine.
[02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:52.422]  They wanted to mix the word guns with meth.
[02:28:53.103 --> 02:28:55.685]  And this came out, by the way, in the federal hearings.
[02:28:56.574 --> 02:28:58.756]  And they like the name Viper is why they picked it.
[02:28:58.796 --> 02:29:01.657]  So it would sound Viper, Militia, then mixed methamphetamine with guns.
[02:29:01.717 --> 02:29:03.839]  It's psychological warfare mixing those words.
[02:29:05.282 --> 02:29:12.806]  And the guys never did anything, never said anything, and the FBI agent made a little bottle bomb, they blew it up outside, and the guys were like, yeah, that's cool!
[02:29:13.446 --> 02:29:15.027]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:29:15.407 --> 02:29:17.988]  We're for America, we'll do that to the U.N., whatever.
[02:29:18.488 --> 02:29:20.469]  And then they all just swarm, and then it's on the news.
[02:29:20.649 --> 02:29:24.851]  Massive terrorist group, Viper Militia was planning to destroy everything.
[02:29:24.871 --> 02:29:27.512]  They were the most sinister brainiacs ever known.
[02:29:28.033 --> 02:29:32.695]  It's like Fort Worcester Telegram, and also Texas Monthly, it's in the takeover.
[02:29:33.235 --> 02:29:36.437]  ...reported the FBI couldn't find a Klan group in all of Fort Worth.
[02:29:37.858 --> 02:29:39.199]  They had a good sheriff in there, by the way.
[02:29:39.699 --> 02:29:43.721]  So the FBI comes in, and they go, literally have their informants go to trailer parks.
[02:29:43.741 --> 02:29:45.622]  I don't say trailer parks are bad, that's where they recruited.
[02:29:46.443 --> 02:29:52.927]  And they found these two guys who were on welfare, who were so drunk all the time, they didn't have money for food for their kids.
[02:29:53.567 --> 02:29:58.130]  And they gave them money, and they, same thing, did, you know, like a little bottle bomb in the backyard.
[02:29:59.358 --> 02:30:05.381]  A little black powder, had them drive around and talk about how they were gonna, you know, do all this stuff, and they talked for months.
[02:30:05.902 --> 02:30:08.563]  And then they give them whiskey, and yeah, talk about it and record them.
[02:30:09.083 --> 02:30:12.325]  The sheriff then got word that there was a plan to bomb the chemical plant.
[02:30:12.685 --> 02:30:19.589]  The sheriff bust him before the FBI to cook a bomb, roll it in there, and blow it up and blame it, I mean, folks!
[02:30:20.190 --> 02:30:22.971]  And then, right after that happened, there was this demonization thing.
[02:30:23.391 --> 02:30:26.073]  There's a new sheriff, and he's a big Christian, and he won't allow
[02:30:27.134 --> 02:30:32.198]  Checkpoints, and he says the police don't need new squad cars, and he wants to cut the budget.
[02:30:32.238 --> 02:30:33.319]  Boy, he was out of there quick.
[02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:35.460]  Did you ever hear about that?
[02:30:36.201 --> 02:30:36.821]  Yes, I did.
[02:30:37.022 --> 02:30:38.963]  And I've been following a lot of those things through the years.
[02:30:39.043 --> 02:30:43.447]  So, I mean, you know, they kicked Sheriff South and stopped blowing up chemical plants.
[02:30:43.667 --> 02:30:45.448]  I mean, it's... They're evil.
[02:30:46.089 --> 02:30:46.709]  But they're evil.
[02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:50.192]  Have you heard Sheriff Mack running for Governor of Utah?
[02:30:50.753 --> 02:30:51.754]  Well, that is exciting.
[02:30:51.834 --> 02:30:52.794]  I was on his show.
[02:30:55.559 --> 02:31:01.943]  I don't get to communicate with him much.
[02:31:02.043 --> 02:31:07.567]  I listen to Shortwave and then we just recently got an FM station up, a pirate station here on the mountain.
[02:31:08.308 --> 02:31:09.668]  So we get a lot clearer.
[02:31:09.709 --> 02:31:13.271]  Well, I know he's on Ktalk, a commercial station.
[02:31:13.291 --> 02:31:14.131]  I've been on many times.
[02:31:15.672 --> 02:31:16.392]  He's a great guy.
[02:31:16.612 --> 02:31:23.155]  He was in this area a couple years ago and he ran for undersheriff.
[02:31:23.616 --> 02:31:25.156]  We had a good man running for sheriff.
[02:31:25.196 --> 02:31:28.158]  Of course, they did a Ross Perot and torpedoed our guy.
[02:31:29.098 --> 02:31:34.900]  They've got a puppet in there now for a county sheriff here in the state of Idaho.
[02:31:35.281 --> 02:31:35.761]  Absolutely.
[02:31:35.781 --> 02:31:36.361]  Thanks for the call.
[02:31:37.342 --> 02:31:40.803]  Let's talk to Rob in New York.
[02:31:40.843 --> 02:31:41.383]  Go ahead, Rob.
[02:31:41.423 --> 02:31:41.784]  Hey, Alex.
[02:31:41.864 --> 02:31:42.944]  It's Wyoming, not New York.
[02:31:43.544 --> 02:31:44.445]  Hey, pretty close.
[02:31:46.152 --> 02:31:48.853]  Listen, I've got nothing but admiration for you, man.
[02:31:49.373 --> 02:31:53.235]  So if you interrupt me, it's okay.
[02:31:53.295 --> 02:31:57.316]  The guy that just called from Idaho, Dan, I thought he was going to mention this guy.
[02:31:57.556 --> 02:32:01.577]  He's, to me, in my opinion, really important.
[02:32:02.318 --> 02:32:09.180]  He's got a strategy for a gradual transition, a peaceful, orderly transition back to the law of the land.
[02:32:10.761 --> 02:32:12.242]  You know, through attrition, basically.
[02:32:12.522 --> 02:32:14.564]  But this guy knows the law, and you never hear about him.
[02:32:14.584 --> 02:32:19.467]  You hear about Earl Schiff and all those guys, which, in my opinion, they're distractors.
[02:32:19.507 --> 02:32:20.508]  They're meant to mislead.
[02:32:20.528 --> 02:32:25.732]  You know, the 16th Amendment, I agree, it probably was not ratified.
[02:32:26.032 --> 02:32:28.294]  However, you don't need to go that route.
[02:32:28.354 --> 02:32:29.475]  There's a better way.
[02:32:29.895 --> 02:32:31.557]  But, I mean, I understand what you're saying, but go ahead.
[02:32:31.577 --> 02:32:32.638]  Let me tell you the guy's name first.
[02:32:32.858 --> 02:32:33.899]  Gary A. DeMott.
[02:32:34.079 --> 02:32:38.242]  And they've got him in prison in Mississippi, even though the first conviction was not
[02:32:39.059 --> 02:32:40.420]  For those who don't know,
[02:33:06.761 --> 02:33:07.942]  People can get a grasp of this.
[02:33:08.002 --> 02:33:15.627]  Here in Austin, CBS News reported, got a clip of it in Police Day 3, that when you go to jail, you're quote, now guilty until proven innocent.
[02:33:15.968 --> 02:33:22.772]  They say that, and they say that yes, if you're arrested for any reason, they ask you to sign a form that you agree that you are convicted of.
[02:33:23.333 --> 02:33:30.918]  If you're arrested for seat belt, they make you sign a form, or try to make you sign a form, that says family violence, drug dealing, drunk driving,
[02:33:32.128 --> 02:33:35.231]  So, and that's not even a court, it's just sign the paper.
[02:33:35.291 --> 02:33:40.956]  That all comes from the silent waiver presumption of contract.
[02:33:41.196 --> 02:33:46.101]  Yeah, it's the same thing when you sign the contract with the bank, then you agree to let the IRS take your bank account without a problem.
[02:33:46.401 --> 02:33:50.665]  But even if you never had a contract with a bank or anybody... They still do it, they presume it.
[02:33:50.685 --> 02:33:54.268]  They still do it, and you have to, and Gary DeMott was prepared to do this.
[02:33:54.588 --> 02:33:56.510]  He's an old man, he's a great man.
[02:33:57.628 --> 02:34:06.031]  He caught their expert witness to the IRS on perjury for stating something she did not know to be true.
[02:34:06.451 --> 02:34:09.492]  He caught the agent, the jury, which was lied to.
[02:34:09.532 --> 02:34:12.333]  That's why it's a jury trial, not a trial by jury.
[02:34:12.353 --> 02:34:17.175]  It wasn't his peers or anything either because none of them, they were all presumed legal fictions under the 14th Amendment.
[02:34:18.076 --> 02:34:18.996]  Didn't know it, of course.
[02:34:19.636 --> 02:34:24.518]  But they convicted him, of course, because they were lied to by the judge, Judge Lodge.
[02:34:25.396 --> 02:34:26.497]  Uh, who was about to retire.
[02:34:26.757 --> 02:34:30.100]  So, for about a year after this phony conviction, nothing happened to him.
[02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:35.205]  See, because Judge Lodge didn't want to get himself in trouble, but he also didn't want to mess up his retirement.
[02:34:35.906 --> 02:34:38.408]  Uh, I'd like to see him spend his retirement in jail, in prison.
[02:34:39.189 --> 02:34:41.931]  Anyway, uh, he has to rule according to law when the law is brought.
[02:34:42.391 --> 02:34:45.254]  I understand, we can't do a law lesson right now, because I have to do a phone call.
[02:34:45.334 --> 02:34:46.335]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[02:34:46.555 --> 02:34:49.198]  But I hope people will look up Gary DeMott on the internet.
[02:34:49.258 --> 02:34:50.379]  D-E-M-O-T-T.
[02:34:51.238 --> 02:35:00.163]  I want so much to get this man out of jail, not just for humanitarian reasons, but because he's extremely important in what we're trying to do here.
[02:35:00.183 --> 02:35:01.244]  Alright, we'll get into it.
[02:35:01.264 --> 02:35:02.025]  Thanks for the call.
[02:35:02.525 --> 02:35:03.145]  Appreciate it.
[02:35:03.966 --> 02:35:06.287]  Last caller, Frank in West Virginia, the 9 to Cover News.
[02:35:06.307 --> 02:35:06.988]  Go ahead, Frank.
[02:35:07.788 --> 02:35:08.208]  Hey, Alex.
[02:35:08.388 --> 02:35:10.690]  I just wanted to mention a couple things.
[02:35:10.750 --> 02:35:16.794]  I wanted to ask you, first of all, there's a fellow that's on your 9-11 documentary who looks like you.
[02:35:17.717 --> 02:35:24.825]  The SWAT team is after him, he's on the ground, dogs tearing at his arm, and then they move in on him.
[02:35:25.466 --> 02:35:33.876]  I was just wondering, that guy, you said that you had interviewed him a long time ago, but I'd been listening the past two years and I hadn't remembered hearing about him.
[02:35:33.916 --> 02:35:34.897]  Could you have him back on again?
[02:35:35.773 --> 02:35:36.874]  Farrell Montgomery.
[02:35:37.094 --> 02:35:37.894]  That's it, yes.
[02:35:38.234 --> 02:35:39.615]  And yeah, we had Farrell on.
[02:35:39.655 --> 02:35:42.096]  He's in Albuquerque.
[02:35:42.816 --> 02:35:43.757]  No criminal record.
[02:35:43.837 --> 02:35:45.918]  He is a carpenter.
[02:35:46.218 --> 02:35:47.658]  Goes around doing carpentry jobs.
[02:35:48.519 --> 02:35:49.679]  And the cops pull him over.
[02:35:49.759 --> 02:35:51.320]  Just so happened the helicopter was there.
[02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:58.863]  The head of that news station has been kind of a liaison to the ADL.
[02:35:59.384 --> 02:36:01.004]  They just randomly picked the Patriot.
[02:36:01.465 --> 02:36:02.365]  Had it all set up.
[02:36:03.032 --> 02:36:03.412]  Oh, good grief.
[02:36:21.638 --> 02:36:37.613]  Well that, sir, they will, and I'm not being sarcastic, a bottle of aspirin now is a biological weapon, a chemical weapon, a screwdriver is a machete, jumper cables are plastic explosives, I mean they do this all the time.
[02:36:38.934 --> 02:36:45.580]  They're now arresting peace groups if they have rocks in their backyard, that they say these were weapons.
[02:36:47.377 --> 02:36:47.958]  That was in the news.
[02:36:48.018 --> 02:36:48.719]  I'm not being sarcastic.
[02:36:48.759 --> 02:36:49.339]  I believe you.
[02:36:49.359 --> 02:36:51.741]  They're arresting people for potting soil.
[02:36:51.801 --> 02:36:52.642]  No drugs are found.
[02:36:53.002 --> 02:36:54.964]  People are getting five to ten years for potting soil.
[02:36:55.004 --> 02:36:55.765]  Cooking timers.
[02:36:56.505 --> 02:36:58.047]  That would be a powerful interview.
[02:36:58.087 --> 02:37:02.050]  I hope to hear it again sometime or maybe find it on the archive.
[02:37:02.270 --> 02:37:03.491]  Is that on your website, maybe?
[02:37:03.611 --> 02:37:04.672]  What was a powerful interview?
[02:37:05.333 --> 02:37:08.135]  I would like to hear that interview with Mr. Montgomery.
[02:37:08.616 --> 02:37:11.358]  Man, that was... I probably interviewed Farrell.
[02:37:11.378 --> 02:37:12.919]  Let's see, Rotaterini came out.
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:14.140]  Would that be...
[02:37:15.285 --> 02:37:18.647]  It only came out about a year and a half ago, so it's within the last year and a half.
[02:37:19.267 --> 02:37:19.527]  Okay.
[02:37:20.048 --> 02:37:20.788]  Well, I'll look for it.
[02:37:21.088 --> 02:37:24.510]  One more interview you might want to recall is Mr. Stanley.
[02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:27.051]  You mentioned him earlier, but you didn't recall who he was.
[02:37:27.111 --> 02:37:29.232]  Now, I didn't hear it all.
[02:37:29.272 --> 02:37:33.855]  Maybe I got things out of context because the reception is real poor.
[02:37:34.595 --> 02:37:37.817]  However, you said some things about Mr. Stanley.
[02:37:38.297 --> 02:37:40.058]  Do you remember having him on your show?
[02:37:40.078 --> 02:37:41.979]  Because I do remember you interviewing this man.
[02:37:43.064 --> 02:37:44.326]  No, you've probably heard him on other shows.
[02:37:44.346 --> 02:37:45.207]  He hasn't been on the show.
[02:37:46.208 --> 02:37:46.689]  Are you sure?
[02:37:46.709 --> 02:37:48.832]  Because... Yeah, I'm sure.
[02:37:49.112 --> 02:37:53.779]  Okay, you might want to... Listen to me for just a second, Frank.
[02:37:54.820 --> 02:37:59.347]  Almost all the shows are basically sewing circles.
[02:38:00.262 --> 02:38:04.384]  For people in one particular sliver of the Patriot Movement.
[02:38:04.444 --> 02:38:05.824]  And yes, they know what they're talking about.
[02:38:06.204 --> 02:38:07.945]  Yes, they're as on as anybody can be.
[02:38:08.585 --> 02:38:10.106]  Yes, they're aware of what's going on.
[02:38:10.126 --> 02:38:15.348]  I wasn't talking about Mr. Stanley when I said that government violence.
[02:38:15.388 --> 02:38:23.131]  What I was saying was, is that they use things like marches on Washington and things like that to backfire against us, and they're very dangerous.
[02:38:24.432 --> 02:38:27.013]  And my show, I mean, we had a caller in the first hour said,
[02:38:27.959 --> 02:38:30.160]  Brian in New York hasn't called in a while.
[02:38:30.780 --> 02:38:32.801]  Are you guys fighting with each other?
[02:38:32.861 --> 02:38:35.902]  I mean, you know, my show is not about what's this guy up to?
[02:38:35.942 --> 02:38:37.142]  What's that guy doing?
[02:38:37.642 --> 02:38:38.703]  Oh, I haven't heard this caller.
[02:38:38.723 --> 02:38:39.983]  Are you all still friends?
[02:38:40.503 --> 02:38:42.684]  My show is about exposing the New World Order.
[02:38:43.639 --> 02:38:48.161]  And I'm not saying you're doing this, but so many of the Patriot leaders, I mean, all they do is attack each other.
[02:38:48.241 --> 02:38:52.123]  All they do is run around talking about the movement and each other all day.
[02:38:52.643 --> 02:38:58.846]  I keep my InfoWar weapons in the InfoWar focused downrange at the globalists.
[02:38:59.907 --> 02:39:01.527]  And exposing and discrediting their system.
[02:39:01.547 --> 02:39:02.108]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:02.328 --> 02:39:05.049]  I've got to let you go, because I've got to really cover some news.
[02:39:05.069 --> 02:39:06.890]  That's another one of my frustration points here today.
[02:39:08.633 --> 02:39:13.898]  Now, you can call me back on tonight, 9 to midnight, or on Monday, 11 to 2, or earlier in the show.
[02:39:13.918 --> 02:39:15.279]  We took a lot of calls today.
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:18.481]  I mean, a whole passel of calls.
[02:39:18.501 --> 02:39:21.424]  That's good, because I usually make the caller sit there forever, and I didn't do that today.
[02:39:22.565 --> 02:39:24.166]  Oh, man, there's so much news I want to cover.
[02:39:24.406 --> 02:39:27.909]  I just want to recap a few things, and the next time we get into some other stories we haven't covered.
[02:39:28.410 --> 02:39:32.893]  Blair sets out his view of the New World Order to Congress.
[02:39:33.474 --> 02:39:34.475]  This is out of the Herald.
[02:39:35.687 --> 02:39:45.610]  In England it says he called for a new world order to protect America and the UK and the world and civilizations from Al-Qaeda who is planning to attack again.
[02:39:45.730 --> 02:39:51.152]  History will judge them as copper and will forgive them if any of the evidence was false on Iraq.
[02:39:51.252 --> 02:39:51.652]  Wow!
[02:39:52.072 --> 02:39:56.214]  They're asking for forgiveness now as the people that blow the whistle are dying.
[02:39:57.074 --> 02:39:59.575]  Like Dr. Kelly over in England who blew the whistle.
[02:40:00.895 --> 02:40:03.656]  And he said that the new world must have order.
[02:40:04.842 --> 02:40:06.244]  Yes, that's the headline.
[02:40:06.264 --> 02:40:08.386]  Blair sets out his vision of a New World Order.
[02:40:09.527 --> 02:40:13.951]  And I believe any alliance must start with America and Europe as part of a global system.
[02:40:13.991 --> 02:40:19.857]  So he gave his little New World Order speech and Congress just loves the arch preacher.
[02:40:21.699 --> 02:40:24.521]  Continuing US had uranium papers earlier.
[02:40:24.602 --> 02:40:26.884]  Turns out that they've been caught lying again and again and again.
[02:40:26.904 --> 02:40:28.966]  They've had to reverse themselves because of documents.
[02:40:29.895 --> 02:40:32.957]  They're pulling big-time Clintons here, but I guess that's okay.
[02:40:32.977 --> 02:40:33.678]  They're Republicans.
[02:40:34.078 --> 02:40:36.360]  Well, Bush will sign the Insolvence Ban, but I guess that's okay.
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:38.321]  Well, he's for open borders, but I guess that's okay.
[02:40:38.361 --> 02:40:39.982]  Well, he's protecting Bill Clinton, but I guess that's okay.
[02:40:40.182 --> 02:40:42.264]  Well, he's giving supercomputers a communist shot at him, but I guess that's okay.
[02:40:43.285 --> 02:40:43.745]  On and on.
[02:40:43.785 --> 02:40:45.486]  Well, he signed on to UNESCO, but I guess that's okay.
[02:40:45.506 --> 02:40:47.948]  Well, he signed campaign finance reform, but I guess that's okay.
[02:40:48.829 --> 02:40:49.309]  Continuing.
[02:40:49.489 --> 02:40:54.453]  Oh, he bloated the size of the government and increased a bunch of different taxes and cut one tax, but I guess that's okay.
[02:40:55.554 --> 02:40:58.816]  Democrat eyes potential grounds for Bush impeachment.
[02:40:59.617 --> 02:40:59.717]  U.S.
[02:40:59.737 --> 02:41:11.446]  Democratic presidential candidate Bob Graham said on Thursday there was grounds to impeach President Bush if he was found to have lied to the American people.
[02:41:11.586 --> 02:41:13.928]  That's the pot calling the kettle black, folks, again.
[02:41:14.749 --> 02:41:16.990]  German cannibals charged with murder.
[02:41:17.010 --> 02:41:18.511]  Remember this when we get back.
[02:41:18.531 --> 02:41:20.593]  Talk about sick and twisted.
[02:41:20.613 --> 02:41:22.374]  A guy volunteered to be eaten.
[02:41:23.055 --> 02:41:24.456]  Scientists to clone mammoth.
[02:41:26.488 --> 02:41:28.771]  I want shopkeepers unveil frankenfish.
[02:41:28.791 --> 02:41:30.933]  You can get a jellyfish cross with a fish.
[02:41:31.794 --> 02:41:33.416]  But genetic engineering is no big deal.
[02:41:33.456 --> 02:41:34.478]  It's completely natural.
[02:41:34.538 --> 02:41:35.299]  It's good for you.
[02:41:37.661 --> 02:41:39.303]  What really happens September 11th?
[02:41:39.464 --> 02:41:40.545]  And who stands to gain?
[02:41:41.244 --> 02:41:42.545]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:41:42.745 --> 02:41:48.487]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:41:48.748 --> 02:41:54.010]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:41:54.310 --> 02:41:58.412]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:41:58.592 --> 02:42:02.397]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:42:02.677 --> 02:42:07.303]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:42:07.383 --> 02:42:13.671]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:42:13.711 --> 02:42:15.534]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:42:15.994 --> 02:42:18.097]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[02:42:18.177 --> 02:42:22.441]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:42:32.051 --> 02:42:33.572]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:42:33.753 --> 02:42:35.795]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:42:36.508 --> 02:42:39.990]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:43.753]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:42:43.853 --> 02:42:47.795]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:42:48.016 --> 02:42:54.179]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.580 --> 02:43:02.485]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:43:02.905 --> 02:43:08.249]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.

[02:44:41.903 --> 02:44:43.824]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:44:44.284 --> 02:44:47.045]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:48.232 --> 02:44:50.293]  Hey, did you hear that Arbico ad?
[02:44:51.873 --> 02:44:58.975]  Man, I tell ya, get a free pack of those ladybugs, put them on an ice cream sundae, absolutely delicious!
[02:45:00.155 --> 02:45:01.915]  Alright, an attempted mindless humor.
[02:45:03.036 --> 02:45:03.996]  That is a good deal, though.
[02:45:04.016 --> 02:45:07.777]  I know Michael Trudeau is using those in his gigantic Wisconsin garden he's got.
[02:45:08.557 --> 02:45:12.278]  And don't have to eat all that pesticide, that's what they used to do in the past.
[02:45:12.998 --> 02:45:16.219]  Kind of a side issue, I know this is not an underhanded plug for Arbico,
[02:45:17.043 --> 02:45:21.265]  I just, I don't know, it's Friday, last segment, and I've been, I got a headache today.
[02:45:21.285 --> 02:45:22.946]  I've been a little grumpy at the collars.
[02:45:23.006 --> 02:45:23.586]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:25.027 --> 02:45:26.707]  I'm just mad at the New World Order, folks.
[02:45:26.847 --> 02:45:27.047]  I am.
[02:45:27.228 --> 02:45:32.870]  I'm kind of like an alligator, just snapping in all different directions here, because I'm so mad at the New World Order.
[02:45:33.370 --> 02:45:35.211]  Talk about degeneracy, folks.
[02:45:36.031 --> 02:45:37.292]  I mean, this is degenerate.
[02:45:37.352 --> 02:45:39.373]  German cannibal charged with murder.
[02:45:40.473 --> 02:45:49.575]  BBC, a German man who confessed to killing and eating a man he met through a website for cannibals, has been charged with murder, prosecutors said.
[02:45:49.595 --> 02:46:01.498]  41-year-old suspect identified as Armin M. is alleged to have killed 43-year-old victim in March 2001 in the town of Rothenburg in central Germany after meeting him through the site.
[02:46:03.038 --> 02:46:09.900]  Turns out that he's part of a group of 400 plus cannibals on one website who like to eat their body parts for sexual enjoyment.
[02:46:10.569 --> 02:46:23.160]  The suspect and victim, both apparently homosexuals, met in early 2001 after Armin M. is said to have posted a personal ad, several websites, and in the chat rooms asking for young, well-built men, uh, ages 18 to 30, to be slaughtered.
[02:46:23.961 --> 02:46:24.541]  Be slaughtered.
[02:46:24.561 --> 02:46:27.884]  The German daily newspaper, Bill, reported at the time of his arrest.
[02:46:27.904 --> 02:46:37.593]  The victim was a 43-year-old Berlin computer technician who had sold his car, written a will, and taken the day off to sort out what he called a personal matter.
[02:46:38.709 --> 02:46:40.410]  And folks, I read about these homosexuals.
[02:46:40.830 --> 02:46:51.275]  They go down to Mexico to have a leg cut off, and then they lovingly slice salami meat off of it, and bolognese, and have little parties.
[02:46:51.855 --> 02:46:59.279]  And Rolling Stone, which is liberal, said, my gosh, a third of the gay men, homosexuals in San Francisco want AIDS.
[02:46:59.339 --> 02:47:07.983]  I mean, folks, you talk about destructive lifestyle, I'll be arrested as a hate criminal for saying wanting to be killed and eaten is wrong.
[02:47:09.304 --> 02:47:13.146]  Yeah, and the liberal groups are saying it's their right to be killed and eaten if they want to and we're wrong to it.
[02:47:13.226 --> 02:47:14.207]  I'm serious.
[02:47:14.567 --> 02:47:15.028]  Whatever.
[02:47:15.128 --> 02:47:16.248]  Just, just fine.
[02:47:16.428 --> 02:47:16.749]  Okay?
[02:47:17.309 --> 02:47:18.069]  Okay, I'm wrong.
[02:47:18.109 --> 02:47:18.810]  I'm an extremist.
[02:47:18.910 --> 02:47:19.290]  Okay?
[02:47:19.550 --> 02:47:20.611]  I guess it's just wholesome then.
[02:47:21.616 --> 02:47:22.917]  Scientists to clone mammoths.
[02:47:23.157 --> 02:47:25.318]  Again, all the neocons are saying how good genetic engineering is.
[02:47:25.378 --> 02:47:26.158]  It's all natural.
[02:47:26.598 --> 02:47:29.340]  Russian and Japanese scientists are hoping to clone mammoths.
[02:47:29.800 --> 02:47:35.242]  What they think are the legs of an extinct animal discovered in Russia's northern Yakutsk region.
[02:47:35.822 --> 02:47:43.086]  Specimens of the animal discovered last year have arrived in Kikiki Universities in Giphy Science and Technology Center in western Japan.
[02:47:43.686 --> 02:47:47.628]  The bone, marrow, skin, and muscle specimens frozen in nitrogen liquid look fine.
[02:47:47.648 --> 02:47:50.469]  They think another elephant can chestate it.
[02:47:51.371 --> 02:47:51.971]  Here's another one.
[02:47:52.012 --> 02:47:55.014]  Taiwan shopkeepers unveil Frankenfish, Associated Press.
[02:47:55.634 --> 02:48:00.958]  Their weird glowing green color makes them look like they're swimming in nuclear plants in a field pond.
[02:48:01.538 --> 02:48:05.901]  But the zebrafish of sale in Taipei shops have an even stranger background.
[02:48:05.921 --> 02:48:07.703]  They're the latest in genetically modified fish.
[02:48:08.083 --> 02:48:11.925]  Their bodies contain DNA from jellyfish, making them similar and shimmer in the dark.
[02:48:11.986 --> 02:48:13.787]  So it's the incredible Hulkfish.
[02:48:15.761 --> 02:48:22.783]  The point here is these neocons are on TV and radio saying this is wholesome and good for you.
[02:48:23.423 --> 02:48:24.664]  And liberals are lying about it.
[02:48:24.684 --> 02:48:27.084]  Well, no, the liberals are busy trying to steal land.
[02:48:27.104 --> 02:48:28.645]  They could care less about this.
[02:48:29.065 --> 02:48:32.686]  Genetic engineering is out of control and is deadly dangerous and it's insane.
[02:48:33.346 --> 02:48:35.347]  And they don't know what the ramifications of this will be.
[02:48:35.387 --> 02:48:36.927]  And it's not all natural.
[02:48:38.267 --> 02:48:43.549]  And all mutations are not natural and good, as my cousin who works for IBM said.
[02:48:44.346 --> 02:48:45.346]  In the Genome Program.
[02:48:47.367 --> 02:48:50.048]  Okay, just quit buying your own propaganda, folks.
[02:48:50.128 --> 02:48:51.008]  It's very dangerous.
[02:48:51.648 --> 02:48:52.428]  I'm out of time.
[02:48:52.588 --> 02:48:57.990]  Ladies and gentlemen, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:58.710 --> 02:48:59.670]  Get my videos.
[02:48:59.710 --> 02:49:00.190]  Don't wait.
[02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:01.131]  We need your support.
[02:49:01.931 --> 02:49:02.551]  We need your support.
[02:49:02.591 --> 02:49:03.491]  We're trying to grow here.
[02:49:04.091 --> 02:49:05.792]  Trying to expand our InfoWars.
[02:49:05.832 --> 02:49:06.552]  We need your support.
[02:49:09.268 --> 02:49:17.671]  888-253-3139 to get my videos or infowares.com or net.
[02:49:17.991 --> 02:49:18.952]  The order.
[02:49:18.972 --> 02:49:19.272]  888-253-3139.
[02:49:19.632 --> 02:49:21.793]  Please support those who support freedom and liberty.
[02:49:22.233 --> 02:49:22.993]  God bless you all.
[02:49:23.073 --> 02:49:24.154]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:27.464 --> 02:49:31.347]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:49:31.568 --> 02:49:37.032]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious, crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:37.312 --> 02:49:38.313]  Ideal for tri-dip.
