[00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:06.810]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:18.858]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:20.319]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.383]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:29.185]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:30.967]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:31.647]  All right, folks.
[00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:34.629]  It's Tuesday, the 2nd of December, 2003.
[00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:37.451]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:43.374]  We have a special guest for you in the second hour.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:11.187]  Documentary filmmaker and author Eric Hufschmid, who has done just an unbelievable job exposing the mathematical impossibilities, the frauds surrounding September 11th.
[00:01:11.307 --> 00:01:25.255]  It is a total conspiracy theory, the equivalent of saying the moon is made of cheese and that there are mountains made of hard rock candy and oceans of Coca-Cola on the surface of the moon.
[00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:37.026]  It's a bigger conspiracy theory to say that 19 lone hijackers did what they did, that the buildings fell the way they did, and that all this evidence has been covered up.
[00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:43.935]  So you do not want to miss the show, the broadcast, the warning, the alert.
[00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:47.557]  In the second and third hour with Eric Huffschmidt.
[00:01:47.577 --> 00:01:48.758]  Of course, we'll have open phones.
[00:01:48.778 --> 00:01:50.339]  We're going to have open phones this hour.
[00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.581]  And there's a ton of news we're about to dive straight into.
[00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:58.144]  PrisonPlanet.com has been updated for you with the latest news and information.
[00:01:58.164 --> 00:02:03.308]  That's PrisonPlanet.com as well as InfoWars.com.
[00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:05.449]  Iraqis deny U.S.
[00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.572]  accounts of fierce fight with guerrillas.
[00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:12.395]  That's the London Independent.
[00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:14.836]  Here's the Guardian, Iraqis Challenge, U.S.
[00:02:14.876 --> 00:02:15.896]  account of battle.
[00:02:18.277 --> 00:02:22.899]  And even MSNBC is saying, well, they sure are changing their story at the Pentagon.
[00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:25.319]  First they claimed it was men in black uniforms.
[00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.180]  I thought that was our guys here in America.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.081]  You know, terrorists in black ski masks.
[00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:35.082]  And now on inspection, many lies are being discovered.
[00:02:35.102 --> 00:02:36.503]  The whole thing could be a fraud now.
[00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.702]  We've been lied to so many other times about this war.
[00:02:39.782 --> 00:02:44.287]  This would just be, well, standard operating procedure or par for the course.
[00:02:44.327 --> 00:02:53.436]  We're talking about a Pentagon that mails out hundreds of fake letters with false signatures on it, supposedly written by troops of how much they love the war.
[00:02:54.317 --> 00:02:58.882]  The problem is the Pentagon only did two different versions of the hundreds of letters that went out.
[00:02:59.884 --> 00:03:06.228]  And they were caught and said, oh, well, we're just trying to lighten everyone up and, well, put a good face on it.
[00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:10.151]  The military propagandizing domestically against you.
[00:03:11.052 --> 00:03:12.893]  And I guess you're not patriotic.
[00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:15.675]  Well, they need to lie to us and run our media.
[00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:18.436]  You're not with El Cato, are you?
[00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:21.919]  Maybe we should arrest anybody that criticizes the government.
[00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.981]  That's being openly discussed on national radio, folks.
[00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:27.923]  And how wonderful martial law is, of course.
[00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:32.283]  So we'll get into the lies there that are now beginning to come out.
[00:03:32.383 --> 00:03:33.023]  Also, U.N.
[00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:34.563]  grabbed the Internet control.
[00:03:34.644 --> 00:03:35.684]  Now coming to a head.
[00:03:35.704 --> 00:03:35.744]  U.S.
[00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:39.085]  man dies in taped police fight.
[00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:39.865]  We'll go over that.
[00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:42.446]  Schools expand their power to keep an eye on students.
[00:03:43.186 --> 00:03:47.547]  All over the U.S., all over Canada, the cameras are even going in the bathrooms.
[00:03:48.951 --> 00:03:52.112]  In the bathrooms, Diebold backs off legal challenge.
[00:03:52.152 --> 00:04:01.054]  They were trying to intimidate anybody that posted their internal documents that they accidentally made public about how they're basically scamming everybody with the elections.
[00:04:02.774 --> 00:04:07.035]  And now a university said, go ahead, sue us, and Diebold backed off.
[00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:17.417]  It's all color of law, all intimidation, hoping you don't find out how the CIA runs the major touchscreen electronic systems.
[00:04:18.977 --> 00:04:22.819]  Stocks jumped to close at 18-month high as the dollar plunges further.
[00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:24.059]  Why is that?
[00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:24.879]  We'll explain.
[00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:28.721]  Factory growth, fastest in 20 years, more manipulation of the numbers.
[00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:33.122]  Gold over 400 an ounce on currency moves.
[00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:34.483]  Normally the stock market's up.
[00:04:34.903 --> 00:04:45.747]  Gold is down, but for the first time in like 25, 30 years, got the numbers here in front of me, got to dig them out, but the first time in decades, gold is up and so is the stock market.
[00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:48.008]  What's really going on?
[00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:49.789]  We'll discuss that as well.
[00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.911]  Big show lined up for you today.
[00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:58.494]  Tonight, this morning, depending on what area of this globe you're sitting on right now.
[00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:03.417]  All the different continents, the ships at sea, the troops, everybody listening.
[00:05:03.878 --> 00:05:04.958]  I'm honored to have you here with us.
[00:05:05.078 --> 00:05:05.959]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:07.460]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.461]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:05:10.422 --> 00:05:15.605]  It's here, and Ted Anderson from Midas Resources wants to be sure you call right now and get yours today.
[00:05:16.064 --> 00:05:18.546]  It's the 22nd edition blue book of gun values.
[00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:24.631]  I love going to all the big gun shows, and now I can buy with the comfort of knowing exactly what that old Winchester is really worth.
[00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:30.656]  Armed with the 22nd edition blue book of gun values makes you more knowledgeable and makes gun collecting more profitable.
[00:05:30.936 --> 00:05:37.121]  The 22nd edition blue book of gun values contains more information and firearm values than any other publication.
[00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:41.784]  Over 1,600 pages with the most accurate firearms prices available.
[00:05:41.944 --> 00:05:46.648]  The 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values contains nearly one million words of text.
[00:05:46.988 --> 00:05:52.172]  No other book even comes close and most of the information in this publication is not available anywhere else.
[00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:53.031]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:06:09.178 --> 00:06:13.504]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:18.111]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:22.657]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:22.697 --> 00:06:24.039]  The New World Order.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.781]  Can emerge.
[00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:30.042]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:30.102 --> 00:06:37.045]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:37.165 --> 00:06:39.166]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:39.554 --> 00:06:49.877]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:55.519]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:07:04.862 --> 00:07:10.166]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:10.547 --> 00:07:16.272]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:16.532 --> 00:07:21.637]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:21.997 --> 00:07:22.658]  We're good to go.
[00:07:46.255 --> 00:07:52.217]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:07:52.517 --> 00:07:57.619]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:00.399]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:00.760]  Big Brother
[00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:17.012]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.732 --> 00:08:18.833]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:20.314]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.095 --> 00:08:22.996]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:23.016 --> 00:08:26.258]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:30.942]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:42.610]  All right, folks, we're now 8 minutes and 30 seconds into the first hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:08:44.034 --> 00:08:46.115]  One of the best researchers out there.
[00:08:48.376 --> 00:08:52.218]  On September 11th, we'll be joining us in the second hour, Eric Huffschmid.
[00:08:53.338 --> 00:08:55.259]  Right now, let's jump straight into the news.
[00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:56.960]  Iraqis deny U.S.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.501]  accounts of fierce fight with guerrillas.
[00:09:00.805 --> 00:09:15.813]  To Ali Abdallah Amin, the accusations and details that were yesterday flying about the latest battle between the occupiers and the occupied of Iraq, the fiercest engagement, some say, since the early days of the U.S.-led invasion, were irrelevant.
[00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:16.759]  I think.
[00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:17.020]  I think.
[00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:34.750]  ...who's charred passport, uh...
[00:10:02.737 --> 00:10:04.758]  They were showing to all comers.
[00:10:04.818 --> 00:10:12.841]  The old man had, it seems, come to visit the ancient gold-domed Shiite mosque in this once peaceful town on the banks of the Tigris.
[00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:17.143]  Ali Abdullah Amin was interested in none of these things.
[00:10:17.243 --> 00:10:28.127]  What he cared about, as he lay beneath a grubby yellow blanket in his hospital bed, was the pain in his bandaged legs, both of which were seeping blood from bullet wounds, and the whole...
[00:10:28.993 --> 00:10:30.274]  In the left side of his stomach.
[00:10:30.394 --> 00:10:33.597]  My legs hurt, my legs hurt, the little boy moaned.
[00:10:33.617 --> 00:10:40.063]  That's right, as he cried in the arms of a 22-year-old cousin, Jamal Kareem.
[00:10:41.123 --> 00:10:49.531]  Now, I've got about 10 articles on this from reputable global sources, BBC, London Independent, MSNBC, you name it.
[00:10:51.813 --> 00:10:56.737]  And some of the press has been to the hospitals, been around the local area.
[00:10:58.611 --> 00:11:16.836]  And people who were there just minutes after the firefight saw no bodies, but it looks like the maximum number of those that were killed, maybe 10, maybe 7, maybe 6, it's certainly not 54, and all they found is children and women and old men that were shot.
[00:11:19.177 --> 00:11:19.957]  So who knows?
[00:11:21.216 --> 00:11:30.699]  This is a Pentagon, I will remind you, that mailed out hundreds of fake letters with fake signatures from troops saying how much they love the war and how much the Iraqis love them.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.521]  This is the same government that has fake weapons dossiers before the UN that are 12 years old.
[00:11:37.190 --> 00:12:00.628]  The same lying, un-American, liberal, socialist, big government group who lied about uranium from Niger to Saddam and aluminum tubing and mobile weapons trucks that turned out to be for pumping up balloons, that lied about mass graves and finding chemical and biologicals dozens of times and quietly announcing, okay, it wasn't true.
[00:12:03.268 --> 00:12:05.630]  And it looks like this is a big fat lie, too.
[00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:16.999]  Just like another stunt, like Bush flying in with the lights off on Air Force One for Thanksgiving to provide a turkey to the troops.
[00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:20.642]  So everyone would say, oh, he loves the troops so much.
[00:12:20.722 --> 00:12:21.863]  He's so brave.
[00:12:22.243 --> 00:12:25.386]  Just like when he landed on the deck of the aircraft carrier.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.803]  Does it matter that he went AWOL?
[00:12:28.204 --> 00:12:30.088]  Does it matter that he's not a real Texan?
[00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:32.514]  Does it matter that he's completely phony?
[00:12:33.015 --> 00:12:34.317]  That doesn't seem to matter.
[00:12:36.382 --> 00:12:36.783]  But again...
[00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.994]  Ali Abdullah Amin was interested in none of the things.
[00:12:42.054 --> 00:12:51.485]  What he cared about as he lay beneath a grubby yellow blanket in his hospital bed was the pain in his bandaged legs, both of which were seeping blood from bullet wounds, and the hole in the left side of his stomach.
[00:12:51.845 --> 00:12:58.173]  My legs hurt, my legs hurt, little boy moaned as he cried in the arms of his 22-year-old cousin, Jamal Kareem.
[00:12:59.238 --> 00:13:03.922]  You may also have been wondering about the whereabouts of his father, Abdullah Amin al-Qaidi.
[00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:11.527]  Father and son were shot outside a small nearby mosque, a spot now marked by large, congealed pool of blood.
[00:13:11.607 --> 00:13:13.129]  His father didn't make it.
[00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:24.077]  Iraqi witnesses were unanimous that Americans were to blame, pointing to a hole in a nearby cement wall.
[00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:29.095]  Cemetery wall, which looked like the work of a shell from an Abrams tank.
[00:13:29.115 --> 00:13:29.615]  The U.S.
[00:13:29.755 --> 00:13:30.536]  military struck.
[00:13:31.637 --> 00:13:35.120]  Stuck by its story of the battle and by its estimation of the Iraqi death toll.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.482]  54 Iraqis dead.
[00:13:36.602 --> 00:13:38.083]  It said all combatants.
[00:13:38.323 --> 00:13:38.984]  All combatants.
[00:13:39.004 --> 00:13:40.045]  They didn't kill anybody innocent.
[00:13:40.808 --> 00:13:45.994]  Major Gordon Tate, a spokesman at the headquarters of the 4th Infantry Division in Decrete, insisted the U.S.
[00:13:46.014 --> 00:13:49.538]  military was confident about its assessment of the battle damage.
[00:13:49.638 --> 00:13:58.207]  Soldiers and commanders on the site contend, he told the independent early commander of the site and responsible for doing battle damage assessment.
[00:13:58.668 --> 00:14:02.132]  Part of that includes counting the dead and wounded on both sides.
[00:14:04.557 --> 00:14:09.780]  Ali and his father appear to have slipped to the net, even though the boy's hospital bed is only 10 minutes away from the U.S.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.401]  Army base in Samara.
[00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:17.104]  And although he was easily found by journalists, he does not appear in part of the battle damage assessment.
[00:14:17.544 --> 00:14:23.227]  Asked about wounded Iraqi civilians, Major Tate said he did not have any information on the subject.
[00:14:26.289 --> 00:14:33.713]  And I've found most of the reports coming out of the Iraqis and the Arab journals, in hindsight, turned out to be very accurate and very honest.
[00:14:34.756 --> 00:14:35.536]  I think we're good to go.
[00:14:58.986 --> 00:15:01.347]  And they'll say, oh, evil Iraqis did it.
[00:15:01.387 --> 00:15:03.427]  Then it'll turn out that it was friendly fire.
[00:15:03.567 --> 00:15:10.789]  I mean, it's just lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie.
[00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:23.173]  And the Pentagon told us a year and a half ago, they said the Pentagon Office of Information is going to plant false news stories and lie to the world for the war effort.
[00:15:23.753 --> 00:15:24.893]  Remember, they announced that.
[00:15:24.953 --> 00:15:27.274]  Then the first story the new agency released was,
[00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:29.750]  Okay, well, we didn't mean that.
[00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:30.911]  We're not going to lie to you.
[00:15:33.871 --> 00:15:39.752]  And I guess they're covering themselves legally by saying, we're going to lie to you, and the next day saying, oh, we never said that.
[00:15:39.812 --> 00:15:40.973]  We're not going to lie to you.
[00:15:42.953 --> 00:15:47.654]  Remember the Pentagon gambling system, which they announced publicly and then said, oh, we never announced that.
[00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:52.595]  And by the way, they've now implemented it through a private company, according to the Associated Press, so that's up and running too.
[00:15:53.835 --> 00:15:57.556]  Just like the Total Information Awareness Network is now running under a new name
[00:15:58.283 --> 00:16:00.124]  We covered from the LA Times yesterday.
[00:16:01.784 --> 00:16:03.385]  It is a wall of lies.
[00:16:03.465 --> 00:16:12.648]  Understand, we have a Pentagon in control of a military that plants hundreds of fake news stories.
[00:16:13.048 --> 00:16:15.889]  That is, letters from troops that they never wrote.
[00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:18.549]  And they don't even write different letters.
[00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:19.770]  It's form letters.
[00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:26.632]  Two separate form letters that showed up in hundreds of newspapers and was in the news for one day.
[00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.372]  And the Pentagon said, well, we were just trying to lighten people's spirits.
[00:16:32.612 --> 00:16:34.353]  We just go, oh, that's what they do now.
[00:16:34.673 --> 00:16:37.435]  They put fake letters in the newspaper.
[00:16:37.495 --> 00:16:39.996]  Folks, that's China.
[00:16:40.036 --> 00:16:40.936]  That's Russia.
[00:16:40.996 --> 00:16:42.577]  That's East Germany.
[00:16:42.617 --> 00:16:43.838]  That's Guatemala.
[00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:45.538]  That's Mexico.
[00:16:45.578 --> 00:16:48.600]  That's everything I was raised to hate.
[00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:53.162]  Everything we were brought up that was bad about the Soviet Union.
[00:16:55.248 --> 00:17:19.191]  And now we have secret police in America, we have cameras, we have surveillance, we have the secret arrest, everything they had in the old Soviet Union, and now they've hired the former head of the KGB, this general, to quote, according to the Associated Press and many other articles, to quote, help set up internal passports through Homeland Security.
[00:17:19.511 --> 00:17:20.332]  I mean, you couldn't...
[00:17:21.204 --> 00:17:22.766]  Make something up this horrible.
[00:17:22.826 --> 00:17:31.634]  The stuff they're doing is so ridiculous, so out of control, so massive, so huge in its diabolical nature.
[00:17:31.915 --> 00:17:45.628]  I mean, I read an article last Wednesday on the show, big paper out of Canada, where it said, well, the parents don't seem to mind that most of the schools are putting cameras in the bathrooms and the showers and...
[00:17:46.164 --> 00:17:55.526]  Then I've got articles today about how they're doing in here, all across the United States, and, you know, we just have cameras now in the bathrooms.
[00:17:56.066 --> 00:18:14.971]  Again, it was good for Winston in 1984, and then Television Week comes out and says, yeah, the new cable box really does listen to you with an audio sensor, and it does track what you do, and your cell phone does listen to you even when it's turned off, and yeah, OnStar's doing it, and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:16.158 --> 00:18:27.503]  And yeah, the government wants everybody to take microchips, and Applied Digital admits it's to buy and sell, and they want everybody to take the chip, and Sean Hannity says it's a good idea, and look at how crazy all of this is.
[00:18:28.644 --> 00:18:41.709]  And now the Pentagon gets caught in hundreds of lies, lying about this, lying about that, planning news stories, and I've been on talk shows and exposed this, and the host goes, well, yeah, I know, Alex, but we're in a war.
[00:18:41.749 --> 00:18:43.070]  Don't you support the troops?
[00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:49.883]  Well, it's one thing for them to fly around broadcasting lies out of C-130s over countries they're attacking.
[00:18:51.104 --> 00:18:53.885]  That's debatable, but not planning news stories here.
[00:18:53.985 --> 00:18:54.965]  No, there's no debate.
[00:18:55.185 --> 00:18:55.986]  It's pure evil.
[00:18:56.166 --> 00:18:57.486]  It's a horrible indicator.
[00:18:57.926 --> 00:18:59.967]  And then you add it next to all the other indicators.
[00:19:00.287 --> 00:19:01.668]  General Eberhardt outed...
[00:19:02.658 --> 00:19:12.540]  Northcom telling the LA Times that, well, yeah, we're under extraordinary situation right now, and, yeah, we're getting rid of posse commentators, but don't worry.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:28.884]  And, you know, we've got Wesley Clark running around of Waco fame saying he wants a national ID card, and we've got the outgoing head of CENTCOM, Central Command, Frank saying, well, if we get attacked again, we'll have to set aside the Constitution.
[00:19:28.924 --> 00:19:31.905]  You know, I don't like it, but it's what the people want.
[00:19:33.652 --> 00:19:36.833]  Then I read an article like this that I keep mentioning, but I haven't read yet on air.
[00:19:36.933 --> 00:19:37.693]  I really should.
[00:19:38.173 --> 00:19:40.734]  First Amendment survey finds knowledge lacking.
[00:19:41.374 --> 00:19:50.276]  More than two-thirds of college students and administrators who participated in a national survey were unable to remember that freedom of religion and the press are guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.
[00:19:51.396 --> 00:19:56.617]  Then when they asked the administrators about if they believe in the First Amendment, they said, no, it's not a good idea.
[00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:03.039]  And I turn on the sitcoms and the dramas, and it's all about how good torture is.
[00:20:03.639 --> 00:20:07.281]  We're being warped up one side and down the other.
[00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:09.122]  We'll be back with the economic news.
[00:20:10.163 --> 00:20:16.347]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:20:16.772 --> 00:20:17.292]  We're good to go.
[00:20:43.516 --> 00:20:48.799]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:48.859 --> 00:20:52.941]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:20:53.362 --> 00:20:57.764]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:20:58.284 --> 00:21:00.826]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:01.266 --> 00:21:02.907]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:03.047 --> 00:21:03.287]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:03.307 --> 00:21:03.467]  Oh my...
[00:21:10.589 --> 00:21:15.290]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.050]  Yes, it's true.
[00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.831]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:21:18.951 --> 00:21:22.952]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills in Viagra.
[00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:23.612]  You heard it right.
[00:21:23.772 --> 00:21:28.734]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:21:28.834 --> 00:21:29.854]  The list goes on and on.
[00:21:30.114 --> 00:21:34.155]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams and herpes medication.
[00:21:34.255 --> 00:21:36.356]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[00:21:36.556 --> 00:21:37.756]  This is a limited time offer.
[00:21:37.856 --> 00:21:42.138]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[00:21:42.298 --> 00:21:43.258]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now,
[00:21:45.759 --> 00:21:46.379]  We're good to go.
[00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:14.550]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:22.791]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:31.553]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[00:22:31.653 --> 00:22:37.514]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:22:37.734 --> 00:22:38.736]  We're good to go.
[00:22:49.855 --> 00:22:54.779]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:22:54.859 --> 00:22:56.500]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[00:23:20.017 --> 00:23:20.837]  This is Pat Cooper.
[00:23:20.857 --> 00:23:23.518]  Tony DelVecchio is coming to this station very soon.
[00:23:23.978 --> 00:23:25.319]  I book any day now.
[00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:26.699]  You're going to love his show.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:33.542]  That's all about this with your host, Tony DelVecchio, Saturday evenings from 9 to 10 p.m.
[00:23:33.602 --> 00:23:36.843]  Central Time, right here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:23:38.314 --> 00:23:39.234]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[00:23:39.274 --> 00:23:46.415]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:49.556]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[00:23:49.756 --> 00:23:55.417]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[00:23:55.657 --> 00:23:58.797]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[00:24:00.118 --> 00:24:04.558]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[00:24:12.719 --> 00:24:18.743]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:19.344 --> 00:24:22.386]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:26.529 --> 00:24:29.271]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:24:30.484 --> 00:24:36.606]  And before this show ends today, I want to read this whole article that I've been mentioning for the last week out of the Washington Times.
[00:24:37.326 --> 00:24:50.069]  More than two-thirds of college students and administrators, more than two-thirds, who participated in a national survey were unable to remember that freedom of religion and the press are guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.
[00:24:51.309 --> 00:24:53.650]  In a survey conducted at 339 U.S.
[00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:59.191]  colleges and universities, more than one-fourth of students and administrators did not list freedom of speech as
[00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:03.852]  As an essential right protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution.
[00:25:04.693 --> 00:25:13.157]  And a majority of them also didn't think that the First Amendment's a right that we should keep once they were informed of it.
[00:25:13.217 --> 00:25:13.858]  Why, no.
[00:25:14.338 --> 00:25:16.019]  Free speech isn't good.
[00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:18.460]  Free speech is bad.
[00:25:20.982 --> 00:25:26.965]  And every time I pick up a law enforcement journal or, again, tune in to a sitcom or a drama, torture, torture, torture.
[00:25:27.552 --> 00:25:35.457]  And yesterday they did have a report that, well, one of the terrorist suspects did die in custody during interrogation, that's all.
[00:25:35.477 --> 00:25:43.262]  The government comes out and announces how good torture is in hundreds of articles and then later says, we never said that, we're not doing that.
[00:25:44.482 --> 00:25:46.003]  Again, conditioning you.
[00:25:47.264 --> 00:25:51.146]  And I know almost every day I mention the fact that they're promoting torture all over the place.
[00:25:51.246 --> 00:25:52.647]  I just can't get over this.
[00:25:53.208 --> 00:25:56.850]  That means they're preparing you, folks, to accept this.
[00:25:58.866 --> 00:26:00.547]  And again, the Iraqis challenge U.S.
[00:26:00.607 --> 00:26:01.528]  account of battle.
[00:26:01.628 --> 00:26:03.410]  Other foreign press are doing it as well.
[00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.431]  They've already caught them in a bunch of lies.
[00:26:05.491 --> 00:26:06.512]  More on that coming up.
[00:26:08.073 --> 00:26:19.723]  But before I go any further here on the electronic voting machine news as they take your right to vote away and the rest of it, I want to get into some of the economic news.
[00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:25.111]  Stocks have jumped to close at an 18-month high yesterday.
[00:26:25.211 --> 00:26:35.856]  Stocks jumped to close at an 18-month high on Monday, led by industrial stalwarts, International Paper Company, and Alcoa Incorporated, the big coal mining group.
[00:26:36.536 --> 00:26:39.477]  As investors welcome the report showing U.S.
[00:26:39.537 --> 00:26:46.480]  factories barreled ahead in November's fastest clip since 1983.
[00:26:49.295 --> 00:26:58.199]  Now, I looked at the indexes last night that they're reporting on, and they're counting global companies that have somewhat of their assets based here.
[00:26:58.219 --> 00:27:02.942]  So they're counting U.S.-owned factories in China and Mexico and India.
[00:27:05.203 --> 00:27:07.084]  The Fortune 500 has gotten more wealthy.
[00:27:07.144 --> 00:27:08.785]  The government has grown by leaps and bounds.
[00:27:09.785 --> 00:27:11.286]  We've had bankruptcies.
[00:27:11.506 --> 00:27:15.508]  We have seen personal and private debt foreclosures at record levels.
[00:27:16.292 --> 00:27:24.558]  But they tell us that despite all the layoffs and people being pushed out of factory jobs and high-tech jobs into service, that things are better.
[00:27:25.599 --> 00:27:37.087]  Businesses are increasingly convinced this recovery can be sustained and it won't just be a flash in the pan, said Richard DeCasser, chief economist at National City Corporation.
[00:27:37.932 --> 00:27:38.512]  We're good to go.
[00:27:38.572 --> 00:27:38.752]  I think?
[00:28:06.224 --> 00:28:12.767]  ...jumped to an unexpected 0.9% in October, setting a record for the fourth straight month.
[00:28:13.867 --> 00:28:15.988]  So we have all these economic numbers.
[00:28:16.148 --> 00:28:19.730]  And why luxury sales of luxury items are up too.
[00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:24.172]  And they're saying the fastest factory growth in 20 years.
[00:28:25.913 --> 00:28:31.535]  But again, they're using all the foreign numbers and what the assets of the globalists are up to.
[00:28:32.213 --> 00:28:32.973]  We're good to go.
[00:28:32.993 --> 00:28:33.234]  I think?
[00:29:02.322 --> 00:29:03.262]  Why is it doing that?
[00:29:03.883 --> 00:29:15.026]  How can gold be at record highs for the last 10 years, gold over 400 an ounce on currency moves, and at the same time have the stock market up?
[00:29:15.046 --> 00:29:25.070]  Because normally when the stock market rises, in fact, not normally, the majority, the vast majority of the time, when the stock market goes up, gold goes down.
[00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:31.032]  But instead, the stock market went up, but gold went up way outpacing the gains of the stock market.
[00:29:32.268 --> 00:29:35.731]  Gold's up, what, 40% now in the last year and a half?
[00:29:36.671 --> 00:29:39.774]  Stock market's up maybe 6% from what it was a year ago?
[00:29:40.534 --> 00:29:41.695]  So look at the real gains there.
[00:29:41.795 --> 00:29:42.515]  Why is that?
[00:29:43.256 --> 00:29:44.257]  Why is this happening?
[00:29:44.777 --> 00:29:57.386]  Well, I'll tell you what I think's going on here from past research when we get back, and then we'll get into the electronic voting machines, the latest developments there, more on the economy, and more on the situation in Iraq.
[00:29:57.406 --> 00:29:58.407]  We've got a great guest coming up.
[00:30:00.609 --> 00:30:01.490]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.011 --> 00:30:03.593]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.534 --> 00:30:07.217]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.552 --> 00:30:15.196]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.
[00:30:15.296 --> 00:30:22.202]  You'll get 25 big packets of Ark's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds, plus four of their most popular self-reliance books.
[00:30:22.402 --> 00:30:24.944]  Learn how to grow your own delicious veggies and build your Ark.
[00:30:25.164 --> 00:30:30.308]  Imagine green beans, carrots, peas and cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, squash, herbs and more.
[00:30:30.528 --> 00:30:34.552]  Then, harvest your seeds to grow year after year for old-time self-reliance.
[00:30:34.832 --> 00:30:38.515]  In Living Well on Wheat, learn how to cook, eat and survive on the golden grain.
[00:30:38.835 --> 00:30:41.816]  Preserve your good food for years with the USDA Canning Guide.
[00:30:42.036 --> 00:30:48.119]  In surviving a bioterrorist attack, you'll learn how to protect yourself and your family now from the attacks our government says are coming.
[00:30:48.199 --> 00:30:49.240]  Not if, but when.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:56.003]  Normally selling for $140 plus shipping, get this whole package now for only $69 and shipping is free.

[00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:16.414]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:24.639]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:30.563]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:31:30.851 --> 00:31:31.512]  We're good to go.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:58.820]  We're good to go.
[00:32:23.676 --> 00:32:25.518]  If you're a smoker, we have great rates for you, too.
[00:32:25.578 --> 00:32:26.178]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:32:43.572 --> 00:32:54.000]  800-430-6692 800-430-6692 We specialize in term life insurance policies of a half million dollars or more.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:59.745]  Remember, one million dollars in term life insurance coverage for as little as three dollars a day.
[00:32:59.845 --> 00:33:01.026]  Call right now.
[00:33:01.306 --> 00:33:02.807]  Operators are standing by.
[00:33:02.827 --> 00:33:02.927]  800-430-6692 800-430-6692
[00:33:25.402 --> 00:33:31.606]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight, we're here live, folks.
[00:33:32.246 --> 00:33:47.055]  Eric Hufschmid will be joining us in the next hour to break down a large strata, a huge area of the government lies surrounding the fairytale story they put out on 9-11.
[00:33:49.878 --> 00:33:52.699]  And how it ties into all the lying we've seen on other issues.
[00:33:52.999 --> 00:34:05.844]  It's as if the establishment is going for broke, is all out, doesn't care how many lies they get caught in, doesn't care how many times they get caught funding and training and protecting and running terrorist organizations.
[00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:13.087]  And then on top of it, they tell us, oh, look, factory output is at record levels.
[00:34:13.808 --> 00:34:14.208]  That is...
[00:34:15.097 --> 00:34:15.537]  I'm told 10 years.
[00:34:43.465 --> 00:34:57.350]  Above 400 an ounce in Europe on Monday as fund buyers took advantage of a strong euro-dollar rate and also dragged silver to a near four-year high above 550 an ounce.
[00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:02.972]  The euro hit a lifetime high of 120.41.
[00:35:03.972 --> 00:35:07.433]  It was 122-plus over the weekend.
[00:35:07.473 --> 00:35:09.754]  That was after hours trading.
[00:35:10.054 --> 00:35:11.675]  The euro hit a lifetime high of...
[00:35:14.054 --> 00:35:25.200]  $1.2241 against the battered dollar early on Monday and also rose to its highest in more than two months against the yen following the death of two Japanese diplomats in Iraq.
[00:35:25.921 --> 00:35:31.444]  Spot gold rose to $397.45 in London after hitting a high of $401.40, approaching levels last seen in late February 1996.
[00:35:42.586 --> 00:35:48.289]  That compared with the 397.75 at the London market close on Friday.
[00:35:48.309 --> 00:35:53.772]  The euro was at $1.19.86 at close.
[00:35:54.812 --> 00:36:00.876]  Dealer said the gold market moved higher, was exacerbated by thin conditions as U.S.
[00:36:00.976 --> 00:36:03.617]  players returned from long Thanksgiving weekend.
[00:36:05.878 --> 00:36:07.339]  And on other foreign markets...
[00:36:08.429 --> 00:36:16.595]  Gold is selling in some cases as much as $450 an ounce in some of the Asian markets, so it's a huge demand there.
[00:36:17.336 --> 00:36:18.036]  Latest U.S.
[00:36:18.077 --> 00:36:25.522]  economic data were positive for silver, which was able to take advantage of its dual role as a precious and industrial metal.
[00:36:26.403 --> 00:36:28.344]  The metal shot up to a fresh $3.
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:38.907]  Plus year high at 550, 5.52 from 5.34, 5.36 previously.
[00:36:39.647 --> 00:36:43.470]  Spot palladium and platinum also moved higher.
[00:36:44.671 --> 00:36:59.342]  Folks, again, if you look back, not even in almost every case, in every case in modern history, when you have the stock market going up, gold goes down.
[00:37:00.467 --> 00:37:03.990]  But instead, the stock market goes up a little bit.
[00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:08.633]  They can call it huge, but compared to other gains in the past or other drops, it's moderate.
[00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:09.754]  It goes up.
[00:37:09.774 --> 00:37:10.674]  They build what is huge.
[00:37:10.754 --> 00:37:12.275]  Oh my gosh, jump back into the market.
[00:37:12.295 --> 00:37:13.856]  It's the best thing we've ever seen in our lives.
[00:37:14.097 --> 00:37:15.297]  The economy is so wonderful.
[00:37:15.598 --> 00:37:17.199]  Put your nest egg back in immediately.
[00:37:17.239 --> 00:37:18.960]  Let us rake you back over the coals again.
[00:37:20.841 --> 00:37:22.843]  And then suddenly gold skyrockets.
[00:37:24.023 --> 00:37:25.685]  And what is Warren Buffett doing?
[00:37:25.805 --> 00:37:28.967]  What is Mr. Soros doing?
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.121]  Top globalist minions.
[00:37:32.843 --> 00:37:34.524]  Well, they're dumping stock.
[00:37:34.564 --> 00:37:35.665]  They're buying gold.
[00:37:35.705 --> 00:37:37.927]  They're saying the economy's in deep trouble.
[00:37:39.188 --> 00:37:40.349]  And they're insiders.
[00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:43.891]  So, again, I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:37:43.911 --> 00:37:45.613]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you what's going to happen.
[00:37:46.473 --> 00:37:57.342]  But the reason, the main reason, and we know this, that gold's going up while the stock market's going up is because the dollar...
[00:37:58.917 --> 00:38:07.478]  Has lost 32 cents against the Euro in the last year and a half.
[00:38:07.538 --> 00:38:14.040]  About a year and a half ago, the Euro was right at around 90 cents to the dollar, 91 cents, 92 cents, 89 cents.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.100]  It fluctuated back and forth in that area because we've been following it.
[00:38:19.821 --> 00:38:28.182]  In the last year and a half, it has exploded past 120, sitting and hovering right at the 120 mark, a little above it, a little below it.
[00:38:29.508 --> 00:38:30.189]  We're good to go.
[00:38:30.249 --> 00:38:30.949]  We're good to go.
[00:38:30.969 --> 00:38:31.930]  We're good to go.
[00:38:57.887 --> 00:39:06.210]  Can come in here with their notes, now the world reserve currency, the euro, and buy our goods because the exchange rate is different.
[00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:14.012]  And this is a massive form of inflation, my friends, a hidden form of inflation, devaluing the dollar.
[00:39:14.672 --> 00:39:15.633]  And it shouldn't be hidden.
[00:39:15.733 --> 00:39:17.753]  It should be the big headlines.
[00:39:17.993 --> 00:39:22.695]  So you got the dollar down by 30-plus percent.
[00:39:25.089 --> 00:39:28.271]  And the stock market's back up by, what, less than 6%.
[00:39:30.092 --> 00:39:32.373]  But it's still lower than it was two and a half years ago.
[00:39:34.975 --> 00:39:35.835]  So think about that.
[00:39:36.976 --> 00:39:44.320]  Now, if we saw the stock market increase by 32%, 35%, I would say, yes, that's a real gain in the stock market.
[00:39:44.821 --> 00:39:51.745]  But if we've got a 6% increase in the stock market and a 30-plus percent reduction in the value of the dollar...
[00:39:52.802 --> 00:39:54.063]  Well, there's your answer right there.
[00:39:54.543 --> 00:40:09.651]  It's taking more dollars to buy the same amount of stock, whereas if you're a European, a European investor, a European bank, or a Japanese, or a Chinese, we're below all these currencies now, folks.
[00:40:09.711 --> 00:40:13.373]  We're at the back of the pack of the industrialized world for the last eight months.
[00:40:15.695 --> 00:40:18.176]  The point at which the euro overtook us.
[00:40:20.577 --> 00:40:21.438]  So think about that.
[00:40:22.057 --> 00:40:24.898]  We actually have a reduction in value of the stock market.
[00:40:24.918 --> 00:40:27.018]  We have a reduction in the value of the dollar.
[00:40:27.459 --> 00:40:31.100]  That's the reality because somebody comes in here with a euro.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.920]  Somebody comes in here with a yen.
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.781]  Somebody comes in here with another currency.
[00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:41.002]  They can buy more of that stock for their units, their fiat currency, than we can.
[00:40:42.583 --> 00:40:46.844]  So when you look at it, we've got a 24% to 27%, depending on where the euro is,
[00:40:51.451 --> 00:40:52.572]  And it's only trending upwards.
[00:40:53.492 --> 00:40:55.654]  Reduction in the value of our stock market.
[00:40:58.676 --> 00:40:59.997]  Isn't that disgusting?
[00:41:01.498 --> 00:41:04.220]  I have a little nest egg, a little emergency fund in the bank.
[00:41:06.442 --> 00:41:13.046]  Not a lot of money, but I've got some cash, some Federal Reserve notes, some zeros and ones in the bank computer.
[00:41:15.788 --> 00:41:18.270]  And it's been reduced by 30 plus percent.
[00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.431]  That upsets me.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:27.065]  But, again, the average American has no idea that we're now attaining third world status.
[00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:30.408]  You know, the dollar has been the world reserve currency since 1945.
[00:41:30.648 --> 00:41:36.593]  It didn't matter if we had factories.
[00:41:36.653 --> 00:41:42.437]  It didn't matter if we had high-tech workers because we still had this fiat currency.
[00:41:42.658 --> 00:41:49.163]  We could go out and work at Burger King or at the shopping mall or at the golf course and take that money.
[00:41:50.259 --> 00:41:51.160]  We're good to go.
[00:42:17.943 --> 00:42:25.129]  Flat screen color TVs, but real wealth, real investment, real capital, real money in the bank.
[00:42:27.271 --> 00:42:29.232]  We have the worst numbers in American history.
[00:42:30.013 --> 00:42:39.241]  We've never been more dependent on government, more crammed into compact cities, more non-self-sufficient, more dependent.
[00:42:40.522 --> 00:42:42.684]  And folks, I'm here on the chopping block too.
[00:42:44.648 --> 00:42:45.188]  We're good to go.
[00:43:14.915 --> 00:43:15.416]  We're good to go.
[00:43:24.986 --> 00:43:25.747]  We're good to go.
[00:43:25.767 --> 00:43:26.447]  We're good to go.
[00:43:56.605 --> 00:43:56.966]  We're good to go.
[00:44:14.079 --> 00:44:18.983]  For their children's insurance and the health care and the taxes and all the rest of it.
[00:44:19.283 --> 00:44:31.353]  And already NAFTA and GATT and the WTO already, when they go in for temporary work at a factory or in a programming job, they're getting half of what they got a few years ago.
[00:44:31.413 --> 00:44:33.014]  Before, $24 an hour.
[00:44:33.054 --> 00:44:35.496]  Now they're getting $12 an hour.
[00:44:35.937 --> 00:44:37.518]  Before, some of them were getting $50, $100 an hour.
[00:44:37.538 --> 00:44:38.759]  Now they're getting $25 an hour.
[00:44:38.779 --> 00:44:39.560]  And it's all temporary.
[00:44:45.538 --> 00:44:47.060]  I talk to hundreds of these people.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.422]  There's houses for sale everywhere.
[00:44:50.443 --> 00:44:55.088]  The shopping malls on those days are empty, whereas three or four years ago they were jam-packed.
[00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:04.158]  I walk into CompUSA to buy printer ink or more CDs or something, and I go in there and there's no one in there.
[00:45:04.678 --> 00:45:08.162]  Before, you had to fight past the lines of people.
[00:45:08.763 --> 00:45:14.206]  Before, they had five cash registers with long lines at them three, four, even two years ago.
[00:45:14.547 --> 00:45:23.752]  Now, they always have one person, even at rush hour, at the customer service desk, and that's where you go to pay for your goods, even layoffs in the service industry.
[00:45:24.133 --> 00:45:25.673]  I know what my eyes show me.
[00:45:25.994 --> 00:45:27.975]  I know what the price of gold shows me.
[00:45:28.355 --> 00:45:32.017]  I know what's happening to the dollar, and it's disgusting.
[00:45:32.878 --> 00:45:37.681]  And George Bush and the Democrats and his Treasury Secretary, they know what they've done.
[00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:46.255]  But they tell you, hey, the economy's doing good, so you sit there in a bad economic situation and feel like you're the only one, and, well, things are getting better.
[00:45:48.496 --> 00:45:50.457]  It's a depression if you're out of work.
[00:45:50.517 --> 00:45:52.718]  It's a recession if your neighbor's out of work, folks.
[00:45:53.419 --> 00:45:54.339]  All right, who's up first?
[00:45:54.359 --> 00:45:55.720]  Who should I go to first here, Mark?
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.061]  Richard, Missouri.
[00:45:58.101 --> 00:45:59.401]  Go ahead, and thanks for holding, sir.
[00:46:00.362 --> 00:46:02.242]  Yes, I have three short things, Alex.
[00:46:02.863 --> 00:46:03.443]  First thing is,
[00:46:04.703 --> 00:46:10.007]  They've taken you off the first hour here at KCXL in Missouri.
[00:46:10.948 --> 00:46:21.697]  And the short thing is, Howard, who has Liberty Ship Films, was his first name Tito?
[00:46:22.157 --> 00:46:22.458]  Yes.
[00:46:22.778 --> 00:46:23.178]  Okay.
[00:46:23.559 --> 00:46:30.905]  And then the last one is, the author that had the book on blood, money, and power, it
[00:46:32.677 --> 00:46:33.659]  Thank you very much.
[00:46:47.224 --> 00:46:49.626]  Which one is true, Magog or Poppy?
[00:46:49.646 --> 00:46:51.086]  Well, I've interviewed Sutton.
[00:46:51.126 --> 00:47:01.272]  He's dead now, but in his books they have different nicknames, but I read that it's Poppy, and people have called him that publicly, his friends and associates.
[00:47:01.292 --> 00:47:05.414]  So that is George Herbert Walker Bush's nickname is Poppy.
[00:47:06.094 --> 00:47:09.636]  George W. Bush's nickname at Skull & Bones is temporary.
[00:47:10.516 --> 00:47:21.001]  Side issue, we've been on KCXL for, I think, four or five years, and I know some days they pick up two hours, some days three hours, some days one hour, depending on if they've got live games or something.
[00:47:21.041 --> 00:47:22.642]  What exactly do you say happened?
[00:47:23.562 --> 00:47:30.345]  They took you off the first hour, and they put someone else there in place.
[00:47:30.465 --> 00:47:31.986]  Well, how many hours a day are they running?
[00:47:32.646 --> 00:47:33.626]  It used to be three.
[00:47:33.666 --> 00:47:34.527]  Now it's just two.
[00:47:35.183 --> 00:47:38.928]  Yeah, but again, a year ago it was just two, and then it went back to three.
[00:47:39.529 --> 00:47:41.972]  They're great folks, and I think they have me on there at night, too.
[00:47:43.634 --> 00:47:44.796]  I'm not able to pick you up.
[00:47:44.856 --> 00:47:45.617]  It's too low.
[00:47:45.937 --> 00:47:46.197]  Yeah.
[00:47:47.039 --> 00:47:50.063]  Well, also, I think, aren't they getting a new, bigger station?
[00:47:50.083 --> 00:47:51.725]  I've been told I'll be on that one, too.
[00:47:52.766 --> 00:47:53.407]  Well, they're in a...
[00:47:57.074 --> 00:48:03.355]  They're good folks, but if you want to call them up and tell them, hey, pick up all three hours, be my guest, but they're good folks.
[00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:05.536]  Already done that.
[00:48:07.876 --> 00:48:18.118]  What do you think about the gold being above $400 and at the same time the dollar plunging even more, and then they're telling us how great the economy is.
[00:48:18.138 --> 00:48:19.299]  I believe it's
[00:48:21.704 --> 00:48:26.308]  More of a continuation of the decline of the whole economic system.
[00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:30.031]  It is terrible.
[00:48:30.431 --> 00:48:32.213]  It's just absolutely out of control.
[00:48:32.233 --> 00:48:33.414]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:48:34.374 --> 00:48:34.835]  Take care.
[00:48:38.037 --> 00:48:43.662]  We'll go to your calls coming up here in the next segment, and then we've got Eric Hubschmidt, who's an amazing...
[00:48:44.615 --> 00:48:52.137]  Individual, in his own right, with just incredible info for you, so I hope you'll stay with us into the second hour for that.
[00:48:52.377 --> 00:48:57.718]  And I do have some news here because he's a computer programmer, an engineer himself.
[00:48:58.238 --> 00:49:03.900]  I want to talk to him about the electronic voting machines, which they've admitted are fraud-ridden and run by the CIA.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:04.940]  That's mainstream news.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.401]  They were going to sue people that were talking about them and exposing them.
[00:49:08.421 --> 00:49:09.661]  They've now backed off.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.282]  Their secret documents were posted by a major university.
[00:49:13.302 --> 00:49:16.083]  They were very upset, but they threatened to sue.
[00:49:16.103 --> 00:49:17.484]  The university said, go ahead.
[00:49:18.945 --> 00:49:20.385]  And now they're backing off.
[00:49:20.886 --> 00:49:22.787]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:49:22.847 --> 00:49:29.570]  Before I end this segment, I want to remind you, the listeners, that I've made ten full-length feature documentary films.
[00:49:29.611 --> 00:49:32.152]  The new one is Matrix of Evil Exposed.
[00:49:33.883 --> 00:49:34.703]  It's a great new film.
[00:49:34.743 --> 00:49:35.664]  People really like it.
[00:49:35.684 --> 00:49:36.844]  We're getting great reviews.
[00:50:05.906 --> 00:50:06.767]  $25.95, over two hours.
[00:50:06.887 --> 00:50:08.609]  Order three or more of any of the ten videos.
[00:50:08.629 --> 00:50:11.952]  They drop down to $20 apiece when you order three or more.
[00:50:11.972 --> 00:50:12.913]  Big discount.
[00:50:13.354 --> 00:50:14.855]  And your purchase supports this show.

[00:50:17.898 --> 00:50:18.699]  They make great gifts.
[00:50:18.759 --> 00:50:21.161]  Yes, I authorize you to make copies of my videos.
[00:50:21.281 --> 00:50:22.983]  I just want to get them out to people.
[00:50:23.443 --> 00:50:23.943]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:50:23.963 --> 00:50:29.807]  Pick the phone up.

[00:51:00.875 --> 00:51:04.716]  Take action.
[00:51:05.636 --> 00:51:08.137]  All that these evil people are counting on is you doing nothing.
[00:51:08.157 --> 00:51:08.597]  We'll be back.
[00:51:10.436 --> 00:51:17.260]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.961]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:19.141 --> 00:51:21.363]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:21.503 --> 00:51:23.584]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:23.864 --> 00:51:28.807]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:29.147 --> 00:51:33.190]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.830]  We're good to go.
[00:51:57.145 --> 00:52:04.196]  That's 888-253-3139, or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:52:04.497 --> 00:52:05.198]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:52:09.685 --> 00:52:12.966]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:13.006 --> 00:52:17.167]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:17.428 --> 00:52:20.228]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:20.408 --> 00:52:22.809]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:23.009 --> 00:52:31.652]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:31.832 --> 00:52:33.193]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:52:33.373 --> 00:52:37.634]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:37.874 --> 00:52:39.575]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:52:39.835 --> 00:52:51.803]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:52:51.983 --> 00:52:58.467]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:58.747 --> 00:53:06.034]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:53:06.674 --> 00:53:08.055]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:10.778 --> 00:53:16.743]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:16.963 --> 00:53:19.225]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:19.405 --> 00:53:25.751]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.729]  We're good to go.
[00:53:48.696 --> 00:53:49.517]  We're good to go.
[00:54:15.245 --> 00:54:26.710]  Before I go to Jerry in Wisconsin and our guest Eric Huffschmidt and some other news on the electronic voting machines, this is all... Every news story is so out of control.
[00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:28.290]  I spent three hours on this one article.
[00:54:28.851 --> 00:54:43.417]  Before I do that, I will be in Houston December 13th at the Alamo Drafthouse Movie Theater at the West Oak Shopping Center showing 9-11 Road to Charity, giving a 30-minute speech, taking questions, and then airing They Live, the John Carpenter...
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:46.681]  Yeah, hi Alex, how's it going?
[00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:15.957]  Yeah, I was wondering, every once in a while I hear you talking about fluoride in the water and telling people not to stop drinking the crap and stuff.
[00:55:16.217 --> 00:55:24.565]  I was wondering, maybe you should tell some of the listeners to stay away from even the fluoride toothpaste and stuff.
[00:55:24.625 --> 00:55:34.454]  I mean, a few years back I went to Walmart and I checked on the shelf and it was like every one of the tubes of toothpaste that I looked at it said fluoride right on the label there and
[00:55:35.071 --> 00:55:38.674]  And if people stop using that, they can't sell that stuff.
[00:55:38.694 --> 00:55:46.381]  It's against a lot to dump that stuff in landfills, but people are paying money to use it.
[00:55:46.441 --> 00:55:48.503]  I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:55:48.523 --> 00:55:49.603]  Well, let me give you an example.
[00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:56.049]  Without having a whole diatribe on fluoride, and I'm glad you mentioned it, depleted uranium.
[00:55:56.269 --> 00:55:57.030]  Dr. Rook...
[00:55:57.975 --> 00:56:01.718]  Top scientist, epidemiologist, radiation expert.
[00:56:01.738 --> 00:56:03.940]  He's got like five medical degrees, okay, folks?
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:08.463]  They hire him in 91 to go disprove that the blue uranium is bad.
[00:56:09.424 --> 00:56:10.265]  He shows up.
[00:56:10.425 --> 00:56:11.466]  He says it's deadly.
[00:56:11.526 --> 00:56:15.609]  It's causing lung cancer, lesions, radiation sickness for our troops.
[00:56:15.749 --> 00:56:17.250]  It's horrible, deformities.
[00:56:18.091 --> 00:56:20.733]  And our troops are three times more likely to have deformed children, by the way.
[00:56:21.553 --> 00:56:22.173]  We're good to go.
[00:56:22.213 --> 00:56:23.254]  We're good to go.
[00:56:47.942 --> 00:56:50.262]  And our news says it's good for you.
[00:56:50.723 --> 00:56:54.503]  Now, folks, this is the stuff left over from nuclear power plants.
[00:56:54.703 --> 00:56:58.604]  It's left over from the separation process to make the rods.
[00:56:58.704 --> 00:57:00.924]  It's left over from nuclear weapons production.
[00:57:01.104 --> 00:57:02.565]  It's deadly.
[00:57:03.565 --> 00:57:06.285]  And they just say it's good for you.
[00:57:06.785 --> 00:57:08.066]  So the same thing with fluoride.
[00:57:08.086 --> 00:57:14.447]  At the end of the Second World War, they had all these aluminum factories, all these fertilizer factories that had this toxic fluoride left over.
[00:57:14.687 --> 00:57:16.387]  They just said, hey, we'll just put it in the water.
[00:57:17.336 --> 00:57:19.557]  And it is deadly, deadly, deadly.
[00:57:19.837 --> 00:57:26.058]  And the back of the toothpaste bottle says, if you swallow even a pea-size of this, call poison control immediately.
[00:57:26.458 --> 00:57:28.459]  It is deadly poison.
[00:57:28.839 --> 00:57:30.219]  And what does it just so happen to do?
[00:57:30.259 --> 00:57:31.679]  And I have hundreds of universal reports.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:33.280]  It deadens the mind.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:41.682]  It is a toxic sedative used by Nazis in death camps to sedate Jews and others.
[00:57:42.002 --> 00:57:42.562]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:57:44.468 --> 00:57:45.408]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:57:46.089 --> 00:57:46.829]  I just wanted to add that.
[00:57:47.009 --> 00:57:47.690]  You made a great point.
[00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:48.050]  Go ahead.
[00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:49.570]  That's all I've got to say.
[00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:52.852]  I just wanted to make sure people are on top of that.
[00:57:53.212 --> 00:57:54.593]  I appreciate it, Alex.
[00:57:54.613 --> 00:57:55.273]  Have a good day there.
[00:57:55.693 --> 00:57:56.294]  Absolutely.
[00:57:56.814 --> 00:57:59.875]  Thank you for the call from there in Wisconsin.
[00:58:01.116 --> 00:58:03.677]  So no wonder people don't know what the First Amendment is.
[00:58:03.717 --> 00:58:07.659]  No wonder most people don't know how many continents there are, where Iraq is.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:09.320]  They're drugged.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.461]  And by the way, your food is full of fluoride.
[00:58:12.054 --> 00:58:12.694]  It's deadly poison.
[00:58:42.024 --> 00:58:51.193]  We have one of the top epidemiologists, and he also has a degree in chemistry on a few months ago, and that's at presentplanet.com in the audio section.
[00:58:51.793 --> 00:58:52.794]  You ought to go listen to that.
[00:58:53.855 --> 00:58:55.496]  It is so deadly.
[00:58:56.637 --> 00:58:57.498]  It's unspeakable.
[00:58:57.578 --> 00:58:58.199]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:00.988 --> 00:59:02.668]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:02.688 --> 00:59:03.489]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:59:29.464 --> 00:59:30.565]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:31.205 --> 00:59:32.025]  You want answers?
[00:59:32.785 --> 00:59:33.666]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:33.686 --> 00:59:37.988]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:38.548 --> 00:59:42.650]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:45.651 --> 00:59:47.211]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:48.552 --> 00:59:51.933]  We're now into the second hour of this global transmission.
[00:59:53.194 --> 00:59:54.014]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:59:54.034 --> 00:59:57.476]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:59:58.885 --> 01:00:03.672]  We're going to have wide open phones in this hour to talk about 9-11 and other government cover-ups.
[01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:09.801]  I'm joined by Eric Hufschmidt, and he's an author and documentary filmmaker.
[01:00:09.821 --> 01:00:12.926]  He's written a book on 9-11 in the cover-up there.
[01:00:14.034 --> 01:00:19.435]  Actually, I got into it in a roundabout kind of way because I just developed software for a living and after the
[01:00:43.925 --> 01:00:44.866]  Towers went down.
[01:00:44.926 --> 01:00:54.531]  I was noticing on the internet there's a lot of people that were called conspiracy nuts talking about how, oh, we shouldn't trust this government of ours.
[01:00:54.591 --> 01:00:56.852]  Something's funny about this attack.
[01:00:57.552 --> 01:00:58.633]  You know, I was like most people.
[01:00:58.673 --> 01:01:00.174]  I wasn't paying that much attention.
[01:01:00.214 --> 01:01:01.675]  I was dismissing them as nuts.
[01:01:02.675 --> 01:01:06.457]  But eventually they got through to me, you know, the constant complaining.
[01:01:06.858 --> 01:01:11.240]  So I started looking closely at what happened on that event and
[01:01:11.758 --> 01:01:14.819]  That's when it occurred to me that those towers looked like they were blown up.
[01:01:15.419 --> 01:01:18.100]  Building 7 looks like it had explosives in it also.
[01:01:19.021 --> 01:01:23.863]  And I was thinking, so my first reaction was to tell people about it.
[01:01:23.883 --> 01:01:27.824]  I put some documents on the Internet saying it looks like these towers were blown up.
[01:01:27.844 --> 01:01:30.665]  Of course, nobody's really paying any attention to me either.
[01:01:30.685 --> 01:01:38.008]  And I emailed maybe 100 or more people at universities and NASA and other people saying, why don't you guys look into this?
[01:01:38.909 --> 01:01:40.430]  You know, look, something's wrong here.
[01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:41.651]  Why don't you check it out?
[01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:43.392]  Of course, nobody would do anything.
[01:01:43.412 --> 01:01:46.433]  And I was thinking, isn't anybody going to say anything about this?
[01:01:46.794 --> 01:01:49.855]  Yeah, they have a massive investigation with a fire marshal.
[01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:51.096]  The barn burns down.
[01:01:51.156 --> 01:01:54.058]  But you have the biggest collapse of steel buildings.
[01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:54.998]  Never before happened.
[01:01:55.619 --> 01:01:57.420]  Building 7 wasn't even hit by an aircraft.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.881]  It imploded from a small fire.
[01:01:59.201 --> 01:02:00.782]  Seismographs picked up explosions.
[01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:01.782]  Federal and state.
[01:02:02.203 --> 01:02:04.124]  The firefighters reported bombs going off.
[01:02:04.164 --> 01:02:07.806]  Firefighter engineering says it's a cover-up hauling the steel away.
[01:02:08.466 --> 01:02:15.009]  All this is going on, you start adding it all together to believe their story is the wildest conspiracy theory ever.
[01:02:15.469 --> 01:02:16.129]  Oh, exactly.
[01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:18.530]  And I was wondering, why isn't anyone saying anything?
[01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:19.330]  What's going on?
[01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:23.012]  Because here I am, sending out an email saying, look into it, and they're not doing it.
[01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:25.753]  Now, Eric, you did find that I was looking into it, didn't you?
[01:02:26.533 --> 01:02:28.374]  I didn't know about you either in the beginning.
[01:02:28.594 --> 01:02:31.976]  You see, the information does not get very far to people.
[01:02:32.056 --> 01:02:35.477]  I didn't even realize you existed at the time I was doing this.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.502]  And, you know, it's afterwards.
[01:02:38.802 --> 01:02:43.845]  After I started doing it, people said, hey, check this out, and, you know, this person, that person, this website.
[01:02:44.486 --> 01:02:47.888]  But the majority of people are, like, oblivious, and they're not talking.
[01:02:48.629 --> 01:02:51.391]  You know, most people, that television is like heroin.
[01:02:51.411 --> 01:02:56.675]  They'll sit in front of it for hours a day and not even notice what's going on around them.
[01:02:57.555 --> 01:03:02.499]  And so they don't really, information doesn't really spread from what you might call the ordinary people very far.
[01:03:03.092 --> 01:03:10.115]  Well, it's spread slowly, but now the polls are 90-plus percent, up from 80 percent believe the government killed Kennedy.
[01:03:10.455 --> 01:03:16.257]  So over time, we do get the story told, it does spread faster than it did a few decades ago, thanks to the Internet.
[01:03:16.517 --> 01:03:17.117]  Right.
[01:03:17.177 --> 01:03:18.578]  That does make a big difference.
[01:03:19.378 --> 01:03:25.801]  And, of course, DVDs and videos are also helping spread information, since people sit in front of a TV so much.
[01:03:26.461 --> 01:03:28.782]  It is a little easier to get information that way to them.
[01:03:29.691 --> 01:03:35.776]  I want to go over what your book and your film covers and the scientific facts when we get back.
[01:03:35.976 --> 01:03:44.022]  And, Eric, I also want to get your take on Diebold and all these different CIA people and all these elections where they've been caught manipulating things.
[01:03:44.603 --> 01:03:47.545]  As a programmer yourself, I want to get your take on electronic voting.
[01:03:47.785 --> 01:03:48.045]  Okay.
[01:03:49.206 --> 01:03:50.787]  Just in a nutshell, what do you think of it?
[01:03:51.308 --> 01:03:55.431]  Well, anybody who's written software is going to think it's probably the same thing as me.
[01:03:56.201 --> 01:04:10.213]  You're just asking to be taken advantage of because it's, unless there's, you know, when it's so secretive, when people are allowed to control this stuff secretly, when the software is secret, when everything is a secret, you're just asking to be taken advantage of.
[01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:18.140]  And then no paper trail, and then surprise, surprise, in hundreds of elections, they've been caught manipulating things red-handed, and the CIA is involved.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.541]  Mainstream News, we'll be right back.
[01:04:21.499 --> 01:04:25.844]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:26.024 --> 01:04:30.448]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:30.609 --> 01:04:34.993]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:04:35.033 --> 01:04:36.355]  The New World Order.
[01:04:37.145 --> 01:04:38.346]  We're good to go.
[01:05:04.824 --> 01:05:07.845]  Then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:05:21.049 --> 01:05:22.691]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:25.233]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:49.153 --> 01:05:50.874]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:05:51.114 --> 01:06:03.082]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:09.767]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:06:10.027 --> 01:06:10.928]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:22.252]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[01:06:22.472 --> 01:06:25.315]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[01:06:25.576 --> 01:06:27.397]  Call Term Busters now.

[01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.187]  Call right now.
[01:07:12.467 --> 01:07:14.168]  Operators are standing by.
[01:07:14.188 --> 01:07:14.228]  800-430-6692.
[01:07:14.248 --> 01:07:14.468]  800-430-6692.
[01:07:14.568 --> 01:07:15.588]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:15.608 --> 01:07:17.289]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:35.888 --> 01:07:49.432]  Alright folks, for this hour and into the next, we're going to be talking to Eric Huffschmidt, who's done a lot of original research, number crunching, on September 11th.
[01:07:49.552 --> 01:07:53.173]  Issues that we've got to expose, that we've got to push to the forefront.
[01:07:54.094 --> 01:07:54.654]  Because you see...
[01:07:55.518 --> 01:08:01.743]  The globalists will continue to carry out more terror to scare us into submission and to take our liberties if we don't.
[01:08:01.943 --> 01:08:17.956]  And we've now got Tommy Franks and others, the head of NORTHCOM, General Eberhardt, saying that, well, we need to go ahead and have troops on the streets and set up a military dictatorship for our safety or the terrorists will get us.
[01:08:18.457 --> 01:08:20.779]  And we've caught them in so many lies.
[01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:23.461]  When you look at 9-11, we know they're lying.
[01:08:24.102 --> 01:08:25.643]  We know they funded the terrorists.
[01:08:25.703 --> 01:08:28.306]  We know they had NORAD stand down for over an hour.
[01:08:28.746 --> 01:08:31.248]  We know they flew the bin Ladens out of the country.
[01:08:31.528 --> 01:08:34.351]  We know they flew Al-Qaeda and Taliban out of Afghanistan.
[01:08:34.751 --> 01:08:38.034]  We know public officials were warned not to fly to New York and D.C.
[01:08:38.054 --> 01:08:38.494]  that day.
[01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:42.337]  From Mayor Willie Brown to the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, to all of them.
[01:08:43.398 --> 01:08:46.120]  We know there was insider trading that led back to the CIA.
[01:08:47.361 --> 01:08:50.924]  Eric Huffschmidt is a software designer, computer programmer.
[01:08:51.024 --> 01:08:52.005]  He joins us.
[01:08:52.626 --> 01:08:52.886]  Author...
[01:08:53.638 --> 01:08:58.863]  Filmmaker stepping up to the plate and waking up a lot of people in the process.
[01:08:59.604 --> 01:09:02.146]  But I first wanted to talk about electronic voting with Eric.
[01:09:02.486 --> 01:09:04.969]  Diebold backs off legal challenge.
[01:09:04.989 --> 01:09:16.920]  Diebold Election Systems is withdrawing legal threats against voting activists and Internet service providers for publishing copies of internal staff emails the company says were stolen from its servers.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:17.821]  That's not true.
[01:09:17.861 --> 01:09:20.363]  The idiots had an open link to it.
[01:09:21.129 --> 01:09:28.532]  The company was storing stuff on their open server, their internet file.
[01:09:29.772 --> 01:09:39.456]  The documents pointed to security flaws with Diebold's computerized voting machines and suggest the company knew about those flaws long before it sold machines to several states, including California, Maryland, and Georgia.
[01:09:40.902 --> 01:09:41.623]  We're good to go.
[01:09:41.643 --> 01:09:42.103]  We're good to go.
[01:10:00.485 --> 01:10:05.269]  And in dozens of elections from Texas to California, they've been caught manipulating votes.
[01:10:05.649 --> 01:10:08.291]  They have wireless Internet connections to their machines.
[01:10:08.651 --> 01:10:18.518]  One of their top engineers three months ago quit, went public, said that they were covering up the fact that they were shipping out machines that had built-in back doors and that were, quote, malfunctioning.
[01:10:19.119 --> 01:10:26.444]  Beginning in August, Diebold issued cease and desist letters to more than a dozen individuals who posted the documents or links to sites hosting them on the Internet.
[01:10:27.125 --> 01:10:31.127]  Then later you'd get your website put back up, but they would just threaten the ISPs.
[01:10:31.247 --> 01:10:32.487]  They need to be sued, folks.
[01:10:33.207 --> 01:10:42.451]  The company claimed copyright infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, a law designed to guard against the improper use of creative works.
[01:10:42.891 --> 01:10:49.774]  Diebold said the documents revealed proprietary information about the workings of its e-voting system that would benefit its competitors.
[01:10:49.814 --> 01:10:52.795]  Now understand, folks, it's all these companies that have been caught doing bad stuff.
[01:10:53.555 --> 01:10:54.816]  Understand something here.
[01:10:54.856 --> 01:10:55.796]  This is very important.
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:00.605]  As Eric Huffman said before the break, they won't let you know what's in the machines.
[01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:01.826]  They won't let you look at the code.
[01:11:02.207 --> 01:11:05.310]  They won't let you have a receipt of what you've done.
[01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:06.932]  Nothing.
[01:11:07.413 --> 01:11:09.375]  And they've been caught manipulating elections.
[01:11:10.156 --> 01:11:16.344]  So you add all this together, then there was a corporate meeting reported on by the mainstream news where...
[01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:28.456]  The government, the federal government, the lobbyists, and the big voting machine companies were all together in a, quote, secret teleconference where they talked about, we can't let the people know about this that we're all meeting.
[01:11:28.796 --> 01:11:30.777]  It could be considered racketeering.
[01:11:32.618 --> 01:11:41.462]  And so they went around trying to sue and intimidate anybody that posted the documents or put a link to the documents or wrote about the documents.
[01:11:42.182 --> 01:11:45.264]  Now writing about the documents was evil.
[01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:47.472]  But people stood up to them.
[01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:49.094]  Now they're backing off.
[01:11:49.114 --> 01:11:56.404]  The non-profit ISP Online Policy Group and two Smarthmore College students sought a court order in October to block Diebold's action.
[01:11:56.464 --> 01:12:03.153]  On Monday, Diebold reversed itself without explaining its decision, saying only that it would not sue over the copyright claims.
[01:12:03.773 --> 01:12:04.934]  In a conference call with U.S.
[01:12:04.974 --> 01:12:18.158]  District Judge Jeremy Fogle, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is representing the online policy group of students, Diebold said it would send letters to ISPs retracting demands that they take down the documents.
[01:12:18.699 --> 01:12:25.281]  I'm told by internal sources inside and around these universities and other activists that suit
[01:12:25.948 --> 01:12:41.138]  Are being prepared very strong suits against Diebold for their malicious false charges against public policy groups, research organizations, think tanks, universities.
[01:12:42.459 --> 01:12:44.000]  You can't do that, Diebold.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.381]  It's not copyright infringement.
[01:12:46.401 --> 01:12:54.407]  When you foolishly post documents about how you're scamming us on your website, then we go public with it and you attack us.
[01:12:55.606 --> 01:12:57.628]  And you did attack us, didn't you?
[01:12:58.328 --> 01:13:00.450]  All right, Eric Huffschmidt, what do you think about all this?
[01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:05.533]  Well, I'd say that computerized voting system is sort of like computerized gambling machines.
[01:13:06.334 --> 01:13:10.737]  I don't know how people can do it without wondering what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:13:10.757 --> 01:13:14.760]  I mean, it's the same thing with those computerized gambling slot machines.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.742]  Somebody could just be manipulating them also.
[01:13:17.802 --> 01:13:18.883]  You have no idea.
[01:13:18.903 --> 01:13:24.507]  I don't know how people can feel confident in it, except that most people, since they don't know software...
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:29.884]  You know, they look at the machines like magic, you know, new magic technology.
[01:13:29.904 --> 01:13:36.469]  They don't realize there's somebody that could be manipulating this on his laptop a thousand miles away from here.
[01:13:36.529 --> 01:13:38.971]  And it could even be worse than that.
[01:13:38.991 --> 01:13:45.075]  It could be that Diebold's doing some things, and then some other groups are also secretly trying to get control.
[01:13:45.436 --> 01:13:49.079]  In the California election, the one of 2002 and the one of 2003, Diebold, this is mainstream news, folks.
[01:13:53.311 --> 01:14:04.641]  Diebold got caught accessing the machines remotely during the elections, adding and subtracting votes, and they said, oh, it was just an accident, Eric.
[01:14:06.482 --> 01:14:12.948]  Right, and then you also have to wonder if there's other people that figured this out, and they are also quietly trying to manipulate.
[01:14:12.968 --> 01:14:14.249]  So you've got a fight going on.
[01:14:14.269 --> 01:14:16.851]  I mean, this is really just asking for trouble.
[01:14:17.458 --> 01:14:25.783]  When you have paper ballots, the only way to mess them up is to be physically there, and that requires a lot of people and requires breaking through security.
[01:14:26.283 --> 01:14:29.825]  When you have a computer, one person can manipulate everything.
[01:14:30.085 --> 01:14:40.611]  Well, on the Internet, there's a billboard or a piece of political art, and it shows a cash register, and it says receipt.
[01:14:41.392 --> 01:14:42.132]  You get a receipt.
[01:14:42.272 --> 01:14:44.254]  It shows an ATM.
[01:14:44.274 --> 01:14:44.994]  You get a receipt.
[01:14:45.758 --> 01:14:54.764]  But when it comes to touchscreen voting, no receipt, and the League of Women Voters is arguing against receipts, and so are the touchscreen companies.
[01:14:55.085 --> 01:14:56.185]  Is that a good indicator?
[01:14:56.746 --> 01:14:57.646]  Yes, it's a sign.
[01:14:57.706 --> 01:15:07.293]  And, of course, even if people did get receipts, unless somebody then added the receipts together, you still wouldn't have a... You know, you'd still have to do something with those paper receipts.
[01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:08.954]  Plans within plans.
[01:15:08.994 --> 01:15:14.518]  That's what they've done now, is they're going, okay, we'll allow receipts, and they go, oh, everything's fixed now.
[01:15:15.248 --> 01:15:17.350]  Right, and most people will take the receipt and throw it away.
[01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:18.691]  So what good does it do?
[01:15:19.411 --> 01:15:21.893]  Unless you take the receipt and say, okay, now add them all up.
[01:15:22.234 --> 01:15:23.134]  Well, it's clear.
[01:15:23.194 --> 01:15:31.060]  You'd have to have a ballot printed out, a paper ballot from the machine, and then put together in boxes for a recount later.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.502]  And they've been caught manipulating that as well.
[01:15:33.642 --> 01:15:35.724]  I mean, it's not like this hasn't happened before.
[01:15:36.104 --> 01:15:36.364]  Right.
[01:15:37.045 --> 01:15:38.786]  Yeah, it's asking for trouble.
[01:15:38.806 --> 01:15:42.669]  But then the paper ballots, if you're going to do that, you may as well just go to paper ballots.
[01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:43.370]  And what's the sense?
[01:15:44.031 --> 01:16:00.826]  Well, the University of California at Berkeley, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, all these top universities did studies and found that it looks like Diebold's system is designed to be remotely accessed and then to have the access covered up.
[01:16:02.047 --> 01:16:04.709]  Oh, I would think so.
[01:16:04.769 --> 01:16:11.615]  Because, I mean, that's the best thing is to have a computerized voting system that gives the people in control control of the elections.
[01:16:12.412 --> 01:16:15.494]  So I would think that was what it was all intended for in the first place.
[01:16:16.075 --> 01:16:17.916]  See, that's the problem with secret voting.
[01:16:18.416 --> 01:16:29.665]  If everybody's vote had a name on it, I mean, if we didn't have to do it secretly, if there was no fear of voting, then a computer could do it because then it could be published and everybody has his name.
[01:16:29.705 --> 01:16:33.287]  We could all verify that voting was as we thought it would be.
[01:16:33.307 --> 01:16:35.209]  It's a secret process.
[01:16:35.953 --> 01:16:43.155]  The secret nature of voting that allows it to be manipulated, because nobody can then look back at the votes and say, well, wait, that's not my vote.
[01:16:44.276 --> 01:16:45.016]  You know what I mean?
[01:16:45.316 --> 01:16:46.197]  You just have numbers.
[01:16:46.877 --> 01:16:48.157]  They don't correlate to people.
[01:16:49.578 --> 01:17:05.003]  So, I mean, if you're going to have computerized voting, the only way to make it safe is to have each person's name associated with his vote, then you publish the results, you get a list of every person and his vote, and people can just randomly check their own to see if it was actually what they did.
[01:17:06.881 --> 01:17:10.803]  Well, the point here is it's horrible.
[01:17:10.843 --> 01:17:14.085]  They've been caught scamming, and they don't care here in Austin.
[01:17:14.125 --> 01:17:19.808]  They've totally replaced everything with these machines, and they just say that's the way it is.
[01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:21.009]  Most people don't care.
[01:17:21.029 --> 01:17:27.033]  Well, most people are just mystified by the computer anyway, and they don't even want to think that this could be manipulated.
[01:17:27.113 --> 01:17:34.237]  There still is resistance from the average person to facing such a big scam is what it seems.
[01:17:34.776 --> 01:17:36.657]  Okay, we're going to break here in a second, Eric.
[01:17:36.677 --> 01:17:40.660]  I want to shift gears for what you came on about, and I appreciate you talking about this with us.
[01:17:41.701 --> 01:17:48.025]  The film you've made, the book you've written, what are we going to cover in the next hour?
[01:17:48.085 --> 01:17:58.492]  Because I want to go over the lies of 9-11, the facts of what happened, some of the key areas of this huge, huge story that you think are most important.
[01:17:59.457 --> 01:18:02.260]  Well, there's basically two events with 9-11.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.902]  It was the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
[01:18:04.922 --> 01:18:08.986]  Of course, there was also that Flight 93, which I didn't really spend much time on.
[01:18:09.946 --> 01:18:13.109]  I was more on the World Trade Center than a little on the Pentagon.
[01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:21.957]  And so those are the two big events, and they're very different from one another, as if almost two groups of people were involved in the planning for those two.
[01:18:23.038 --> 01:18:23.379]  And so...
[01:18:25.817 --> 01:18:27.718]  I would say that's the biggest part of this.
[01:18:27.858 --> 01:18:41.541]  Flight 93 is a bit of a mystery also, but the most obvious part of this scam are those towers and Building 7, and then, of course, the Pentagon being hit, and nobody can find any plane parts or body parts.
[01:18:42.741 --> 01:18:45.561]  So, I mean, if you want, we can discuss those two.
[01:18:45.581 --> 01:18:52.823]  Yeah, let's go over just blow by blow what you put in the book, what you put in the film, because it's conclusive.
[01:18:53.699 --> 01:18:54.760]  We're being lied to.
[01:18:55.761 --> 01:19:09.373]  And then you add the whole cover-up with the wreckage, and then there's all the political tie-ins with the public officials being told not to fly and the bin Ladens being flown out, and the CIA running a drill that morning of flying planes into buildings in New York and D.C.
[01:19:09.413 --> 01:19:10.735]  and ordering NORAD to stand down.
[01:19:12.216 --> 01:19:13.477]  We're not going to get into those facets.
[01:19:13.497 --> 01:19:18.041]  We'll get into the mathematical computations with the towers.
[01:19:18.201 --> 01:19:18.842]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:22.048 --> 01:19:25.710]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:19:26.111 --> 01:19:31.534]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:19:32.014 --> 01:19:33.095]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:37.197]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:19:37.838 --> 01:19:51.066]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:19:51.616 --> 01:19:52.437]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.

[01:19:54.518 --> 01:19:54.878]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:54.938 --> 01:19:56.919]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:19:56.939 --> 01:19:56.999]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:21.752 --> 01:20:25.313]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[01:20:25.633 --> 01:20:25.974]  Yes.
[01:20:26.254 --> 01:20:31.056]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[01:20:31.176 --> 01:20:40.099]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[01:20:40.259 --> 01:20:47.962]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[01:20:48.182 --> 01:20:50.363]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[01:20:50.743 --> 01:20:57.789]  The 200 pages of our book, Wheatgrass, Nature's Finest Medicine, will remove any anxieties you may have about your nutritional supply.
[01:20:57.949 --> 01:21:01.633]  In this kit, you will receive no monthly bills, no monthly pills.
[01:21:01.813 --> 01:21:03.434]  This is real self-sufficiency.

[01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:18.427]  And thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[01:21:20.791 --> 01:21:22.752]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:21:22.852 --> 01:21:23.512]  Hello, folks.
[01:21:23.632 --> 01:21:33.557]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 fluoride and arsenic reduction elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:21:33.937 --> 01:21:38.459]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:49.865]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:21:50.445 --> 01:21:57.313]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:21:57.713 --> 01:21:59.835]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:22:00.336 --> 01:22:05.321]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:11.748]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803.
[01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:14.150]  Hey Doris, great news!
[01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:17.711]  I now own my own home, free and clear, and I did it in less than five months.
[01:22:17.751 --> 01:22:18.852]  Did you receive an inheritance?
[01:22:28.317 --> 01:22:28.777]  Well, no.
[01:22:28.937 --> 01:22:33.639]  Actually, I found a way to eliminate my mortgage without bankruptcy and without the need of going to court.
[01:22:33.779 --> 01:22:37.040]  And you too can do this legally, lawfully, ethically, and morally.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.541]  But Jim, I signed a note promising to pay back the loan.
[01:22:39.681 --> 01:22:41.741]  Isn't it wrong even if I could discharge the loan?
[01:22:41.942 --> 01:22:46.783]  Doris, I felt the same way until I took the time to learn the truth about money and banking.
[01:22:46.903 --> 01:22:50.784]  The most shocking thing I learned is the fact that no real money is ever loaned out.
[01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:52.585]  There's a dirty secret that the bank
[01:22:52.745 --> 01:22:53.605]  Don't want you to know.
[01:22:53.766 --> 01:22:57.367]  And this is the basis of how I was able to discharge my own mortgage.
[01:22:57.547 --> 01:23:00.469]  I know this is hard to believe, but go to the website to learn more.
[01:23:00.609 --> 01:23:07.992]  Doris, get your pin and find out how many Americans are finding financial freedom by having their mortgages eliminated in less than five months.
[01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:12.814]  Go to www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[01:23:12.955 --> 01:23:15.376]  Just the way it sounds and there's an S after mortgage.
[01:23:15.576 --> 01:23:20.238]  It's www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:38.683]  All right, we're talking to Eric Huffschmidt, writer, researcher, documentary filmmaker, software engineer, programmer.
[01:23:41.584 --> 01:23:48.087]  And for those that just joined us, Eric, again, plug the name of the book and the film, and later we'll tell folks how to get those.
[01:23:48.127 --> 01:23:51.548]  And then I want to go into what really happened on 9-11.
[01:23:51.588 --> 01:23:57.971]  All right, the book is called Painful Questions, an Analysis of the September 11th Attack, and the
[01:23:58.638 --> 01:24:04.520]  There are hundreds of color pictures in that, and then of course there's the film.
[01:24:23.852 --> 01:24:25.753]  So let's just say I'm an average guy on the street.
[01:24:25.793 --> 01:24:26.473]  You've got the film.
[01:24:26.493 --> 01:24:27.113]  You've got the book.
[01:24:27.133 --> 01:24:28.534]  You're going to try to explain this to me.
[01:24:29.014 --> 01:24:29.814]  What happened?
[01:24:29.854 --> 01:24:30.174]  Tell me.
[01:24:31.315 --> 01:24:44.460]  Well, what it looks like, when you look at how these towers... First of all, when the planes hit the towers, you cannot even see in the video that the... I mean, there were news cameras all around it, and those towers didn't hardly move.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:50.022]  They swallowed those planes up as if they were nothing, like a bee had run into them.
[01:24:50.566 --> 01:24:51.147]  We're good to go.
[01:25:14.761 --> 01:25:14.981]  I think.
[01:25:42.662 --> 01:25:46.163]  So at that point, it starts becoming like a regular office fire.
[01:25:46.843 --> 01:25:50.184]  And office fires have never destroyed steel buildings before.
[01:25:51.244 --> 01:25:58.825]  So the events were, you know, the plane hit the building, the building did nothing but sway a little bit, and then you got some fires going.
[01:25:59.406 --> 01:26:07.207]  And then, for no apparent reason, the building, the South Tower, just starts pulverizing itself into dust.
[01:26:07.987 --> 01:26:09.408]  Now, this is the key thing.
[01:26:09.448 --> 01:26:10.548]  It didn't just crack and
[01:26:11.195 --> 01:26:11.455]  Thank you.
[01:26:38.163 --> 01:26:40.547]  I mean, when do buildings fall down like this?
[01:26:42.512 --> 01:26:44.714]  Again, there's just so many indicators here.
[01:27:11.776 --> 01:27:12.036]  Right.
[01:27:12.316 --> 01:27:18.198]  And then when you look at the rubble, there's not even a piece of anything except steel.
[01:27:18.218 --> 01:27:19.418]  There's some steel beams.
[01:27:19.438 --> 01:27:24.659]  The entire structure, both towers, everything disintegrated.
[01:27:24.679 --> 01:27:34.402]  I mean, it'd be at least acceptable if maybe a piece had fallen down and hit the ground in a big chunk, but everything down into the basement is...
[01:27:35.211 --> 01:27:37.552]  I mean, the two towers, how do you explain this?
[01:27:37.632 --> 01:27:38.652]  Nobody can explain this.
[01:27:38.812 --> 01:27:43.714]  No fire has ever done this to a building before, and there have been a lot of fires.
[01:27:44.274 --> 01:27:51.296]  Well, by the way, I mean, a fighter bomber, what was it?
[01:27:51.416 --> 01:27:53.516]  Oh, the one that hit the Empire State Building.
[01:27:53.536 --> 01:27:55.817]  Yeah, a B-17 flew into it.
[01:27:56.817 --> 01:27:58.918]  And it started a big fire also.
[01:27:59.989 --> 01:28:01.332]  But it's like everything.
[01:28:01.954 --> 01:28:05.061]  The steel buildings, they can survive this sort of thing.
[01:28:06.043 --> 01:28:09.391]  And the fires, I mean, steel can contain a fire.
[01:28:09.431 --> 01:28:09.772]  It doesn't.
[01:28:10.307 --> 01:28:11.148]  Disintegrate from it.
[01:28:11.208 --> 01:28:14.010]  I mean, look at the steel grate in your fireplace or a barbecue pit.
[01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:37.548]  Well, then in the book you get into the temperatures, and that's been put out there, that it would take at least 600 to 700 degrees more on top of what jet fuel burns it to do this, but instead there's all these NOVA specials, what made the towers fall, Discovery Channel specials, just full of propaganda that I want to ask them, Eric, what made Building 7, what, like eight hours later, implode and fall down?
[01:28:37.848 --> 01:28:38.088]  Right.
[01:28:38.228 --> 01:28:42.029]  In the evening about 5.30, that building just suddenly collapses.
[01:28:42.109 --> 01:28:43.210]  And it doesn't collapse.
[01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:45.851]  It pulverizes itself, just like the towers.
[01:28:46.711 --> 01:28:52.293]  And the interesting thing is, almost nobody even knows what this building is or that it collapsed.
[01:28:52.413 --> 01:28:56.354]  And there's only one reason why you don't see Nova explaining this.
[01:28:57.015 --> 01:28:58.995]  Nobody can come up with something.
[01:28:59.795 --> 01:29:05.777]  Also in the New York Daily News, Giuliani says, I got a call from someone saying, get out of the building.
[01:29:05.878 --> 01:29:07.098]  Then the fire started.
[01:29:07.777 --> 01:29:08.438]  Stay there, Eric.
[01:29:08.458 --> 01:29:09.520]  We'll come back and cover that.
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:10.202]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:29:22.543 --> 01:29:23.023]  We're good to go.
[01:29:51.092 --> 01:29:54.854]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:29:55.134 --> 01:30:01.757]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.

[01:30:22.859 --> 01:30:25.060]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:29.861]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:30:30.141 --> 01:30:35.943]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:30:36.163 --> 01:30:40.225]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:30:40.505 --> 01:30:46.147]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:30:46.267 --> 01:30:48.887]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:30:50.988 --> 01:30:51.248]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:51.268 --> 01:30:51.508]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.

[01:32:15.751 --> 01:32:20.913]  Don't worry.
[01:32:26.074 --> 01:32:27.595]  This show is documented.
[01:32:28.135 --> 01:32:30.876]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:31.276 --> 01:32:34.897]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:32:35.237 --> 01:32:39.398]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:32:39.858 --> 01:32:41.799]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:32:44.424 --> 01:32:56.296]  We're talking to Eric Huffman, and folks, I carry his book, Painful Questions, over 100 pages of color photographs and documents.
[01:32:57.297 --> 01:32:58.879]  And believe me, it's all on target.
[01:32:58.899 --> 01:32:59.720]  He's a smart guy.
[01:33:00.623 --> 01:33:02.364]  An analysis of the September 11th attacks.
[01:33:02.445 --> 01:33:04.886]  Now there's the film, Painful Deceptions.
[01:33:04.906 --> 01:33:09.470]  We've already aired this about ten times locally here on the local cable channel.
[01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:12.853]  People request it like mad, want to see it re-aired.
[01:33:13.473 --> 01:33:20.079]  Please go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com because I just started carrying the video and DVD.
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:24.282]  It's an amazing film, two hours long.
[01:33:25.313 --> 01:33:30.579]  You really need to get Painful Deceptions the video and Painful Questions the book.
[01:33:31.199 --> 01:33:35.064]  You need to get these and you need to give them to public officials, engineers.
[01:33:36.552 --> 01:33:41.277]  Folks in your area, because, again, if we don't expose 9-11, it's over, folks.
[01:33:41.297 --> 01:33:43.879]  They're going to carry out more and more attacks.
[01:33:43.999 --> 01:33:47.283]  Now, the toll-free number to get painful deceptions is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:33:47.303 --> 01:33:49.565]  That's 888-253-3139, or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com.
[01:33:59.495 --> 01:34:01.697]  And when you get the film, you support this show.
[01:34:16.095 --> 01:34:17.556]  When you get the book, you support this show.
[01:34:17.596 --> 01:34:28.462]  You also support the work of Eric Huffschmidt, a very successful software engineer and computer programmer in his own right, who saw the lies, was outraged by them, just like I was ten years ago.
[01:34:28.862 --> 01:34:34.385]  But he was outraged two years ago and began his crusade to expose this evil.
[01:34:34.585 --> 01:34:39.148]  So, again, please get Painful Deceptions, the video or DVD online.
[01:34:40.206 --> 01:34:45.287]  And please get the book, Painful Questions, available through our operation.
[01:34:45.327 --> 01:34:56.850]  I'm also now carrying Loss of Liberty, the two-hour film covering the facts of what really happened to the USS Liberty, again exposing government-sponsored terror.
[01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:58.911]  This is their race in the hole.
[01:34:59.471 --> 01:35:01.351]  This is how they scare us into submission.
[01:35:02.212 --> 01:35:03.452]  Eric, I wanted to mention something.
[01:35:04.631 --> 01:35:11.040]  And this interview is still posted from September 11, 2001 on the website.
[01:35:12.382 --> 01:35:19.111]  I had a fellow, Jimmy Wright, on the show, who is a big successful banker.
[01:35:20.727 --> 01:35:23.069]  Well, that is, he works for a big bank.
[01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:25.951]  He does international deals on real estate.
[01:35:26.311 --> 01:35:31.816]  He lives in New York, but he's married to one of my friend's sisters.
[01:35:31.896 --> 01:35:34.338]  And so I've been out to their ranch quite a few times.
[01:35:34.378 --> 01:35:35.579]  I consider him a friend of mine.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.702]  They have a ranch out in Fredericksburg, Texas.
[01:35:40.563 --> 01:35:43.646]  And on the morning of 9-11, I was on Derry Brownfield's show.
[01:35:43.666 --> 01:35:44.547]  I was on other shows.
[01:35:44.647 --> 01:35:46.168]  I thought, who do I know in New York?
[01:35:46.764 --> 01:35:50.165]  And I called out to the ranch, and I said, is Jimmy in New York?
[01:35:50.185 --> 01:35:50.885]  And they said, yes.
[01:35:52.105 --> 01:35:53.645]  He's also an accomplished sailor.
[01:35:53.685 --> 01:35:58.946]  The guy lives on his boat there in the harbor, literally just a few hundred yards from the World Trade Center.
[01:35:59.667 --> 01:36:03.107]  And he was in the World Financial Center just a couple hundred yards away.
[01:36:03.547 --> 01:36:08.808]  He was up there on the 40, I believe, 42nd floor looking across at the towers.
[01:36:09.609 --> 01:36:11.569]  This is just an hour or two after it happens.
[01:36:11.749 --> 01:36:12.249]  I call.
[01:36:12.369 --> 01:36:14.009]  I get him on at the start of the show.
[01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:16.270]  Mr. Wright...
[01:36:17.151 --> 01:36:23.795]  Also has a degree in engineering.
[01:36:25.236 --> 01:36:27.397]  And again, unprompted.
[01:36:28.346 --> 01:36:32.689]  Out of his mouth, he said this is the most controlled demolition I've ever seen.
[01:36:32.869 --> 01:36:34.610]  Again, he's got an architecture degree, folks.
[01:36:34.630 --> 01:36:35.251]  He's an engineer.
[01:36:35.751 --> 01:36:38.773]  He says it's the most controlled demolition I've ever seen.
[01:36:39.494 --> 01:36:41.815]  Something inside those buildings brought them down.
[01:36:42.256 --> 01:36:45.658]  They imploded in a symmetrical fashion.
[01:36:45.958 --> 01:36:52.703]  And he was on with us for about 30 minutes via cell phone, literally in the dust, in the rubble, saying this.
[01:36:53.564 --> 01:37:00.955]  And the designer of the building said this, and in the design said it was designed to take a jumbo jet.
[01:37:01.996 --> 01:37:05.602]  Then a big engineer out at a university in New Mexico said it.
[01:37:05.842 --> 01:37:07.585]  They suddenly all shut up.
[01:37:08.408 --> 01:37:11.851]  I talked to firefighters who said, I can't come on, I've been told to shut up.
[01:37:12.171 --> 01:37:14.733]  Firefighters have been quoted as saying bombs were going off.
[01:37:15.114 --> 01:37:16.895]  Eric Hufschmidt, how does this all tie together?
[01:37:17.095 --> 01:37:17.996]  Let's go through the facts.
[01:37:18.517 --> 01:37:21.539]  Well, I'd have to... That's probably very accurate.
[01:37:21.559 --> 01:37:26.964]  I mean, the people, if you look closely at these photos, you can see why they think it's a demolition.
[01:37:26.984 --> 01:37:29.606]  Because buildings just don't behave in this manner.
[01:37:29.626 --> 01:37:32.809]  It looks like somebody lit them on fire and they're just things going off.
[01:37:32.869 --> 01:37:36.492]  It's turning to dust, flying out hundreds and hundreds of feet.
[01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:40.019]  And they go floor by floor very, very symmetrically.
[01:37:40.579 --> 01:37:43.741]  I mean, you can see it if you look closely at these pictures in the page 52, 3, 4, and so on.
[01:37:43.801 --> 01:37:51.025]  This is one line after the other, floor by floor, dust flying out.
[01:37:51.726 --> 01:37:57.489]  And there's so many suspicious aspects of it, like people going to work and saying, well, how come there's nobody in this office but me?
[01:37:57.509 --> 01:37:59.270]  You know, where is everybody?
[01:37:59.570 --> 01:38:04.573]  By the way, MSNBC had a headline, Urban Legend Not.
[01:38:05.262 --> 01:38:08.445]  They went and interviewed everybody and did find out the building was over half empty.
[01:38:08.645 --> 01:38:12.548]  The children across the street a week before were saying those buildings will be gone next week.
[01:38:13.048 --> 01:38:16.230]  They found out that, indeed, that was true.
[01:38:17.571 --> 01:38:18.312]  Right.
[01:38:18.432 --> 01:38:22.996]  Even in Building 7, there were some people going up there to their work and thinking, where is everybody?
[01:38:23.016 --> 01:38:27.739]  And that building evacuated very early in the morning also.
[01:38:28.019 --> 01:38:28.520]  By the way...
[01:38:29.645 --> 01:38:31.206]  Guess who was based there?
[01:38:31.947 --> 01:38:36.670]  In 99, they built the Y2K command center there with the bulletproof glass, the rest of it.
[01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:39.651]  The CIA and the FBI were based in that building.
[01:38:40.272 --> 01:38:40.572]  Right.
[01:38:40.692 --> 01:38:43.534]  Yeah, I think the Department of Defense might be in there, too.
[01:38:43.734 --> 01:38:44.274]  Yeah, everybody.
[01:38:44.294 --> 01:38:45.455]  It was a big government nest.
[01:38:45.995 --> 01:38:46.196]  Right.
[01:38:46.256 --> 01:38:54.521]  Also, they said that there were fires so hot on the 60th to 90th floors, but there's video and photos of people leaning out the windows.
[01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:56.730]  Oh, you can't even see the photos.
[01:38:56.790 --> 01:39:02.972]  I mean, you look at the photos, you can't find only more than a few flames and just a couple of the floors of that building.
[01:39:04.033 --> 01:39:06.734]  And even the towers, there weren't that many flames either.
[01:39:06.854 --> 01:39:08.354]  So, I mean, there's something.
[01:39:08.854 --> 01:39:13.076]  You can tell this fire, the whole story of the fires is so grossly exaggerated.
[01:39:13.756 --> 01:39:17.697]  The fires were all small, and they don't affect steel buildings like this at all anyway.
[01:39:18.477 --> 01:39:20.918]  And then, of course, with Building 7, you had another strange thing.
[01:39:21.593 --> 01:39:23.254]  Between 4 and 5 p.m.
[01:39:23.334 --> 01:39:27.977]  that afternoon, people that were near the building were told to get away because it might come down.
[01:39:27.997 --> 01:39:31.739]  I mean, under what... Who would ever say something like that?
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:36.222]  Who would ever tell somebody, oh, stand back, that building just might collapse?
[01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:46.909]  By the way, and again, in your book and your film, and I've got all these news articles at prisonplanet.com, over 500, we stopped at about 550 articles on this.
[01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:48.150]  Mainstream, folks.
[01:39:49.847 --> 01:39:55.069]  Firefighters, engineers, they're all saying, we've never seen anything like this.
[01:39:55.089 --> 01:40:03.111]  A building has never, never, a new design, that means the last 80 years, has never collapsed.
[01:40:03.131 --> 01:40:04.992]  And they've been hit by aircraft before, Eric.
[01:40:05.412 --> 01:40:05.652]  Right.
[01:40:06.393 --> 01:40:09.914]  And they've had bombs go off in them, they've had fires, they've had earthquakes.
[01:40:10.754 --> 01:40:14.935]  All over the world, you have disasters, but when do you ever see buildings do anything?
[01:40:14.955 --> 01:40:16.196]  Steel buildings...
[01:40:17.009 --> 01:40:18.010]  They don't do this.
[01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:24.695]  And so we're supposed to believe that on that day, three buildings did something no building has ever done before.
[01:40:24.795 --> 01:40:26.556]  You know, it's like a Star Trek movie or something.
[01:40:27.257 --> 01:40:28.318]  It's just bizarre.
[01:40:29.178 --> 01:40:34.823]  And so how people can believe it, the way they get away with the Building 7 problem is by ignoring it.
[01:40:35.083 --> 01:40:36.164]  Just don't even talk about it.
[01:40:38.345 --> 01:40:41.146]  PBS special and the Discovery special, I watch both of them.
[01:40:41.186 --> 01:40:42.126]  Not a mention of Building 7.
[01:40:42.846 --> 01:40:43.727]  That's the best way.
[01:40:43.747 --> 01:40:51.989]  It seems the best way to avoid this is to just don't talk about it, because if you talk about it, then people start saying, hey, wait a minute, what hit that building?
[01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:53.190]  What brought that down?
[01:40:53.690 --> 01:40:54.710]  So you just don't mention it.
[01:40:55.351 --> 01:40:58.452]  Most people will not go beyond what they see on TV.
[01:40:58.492 --> 01:41:01.353]  They won't even ask these questions like, well, what happened?
[01:41:02.233 --> 01:41:05.194]  And so if they don't mention it, then people don't even know it existed.
[01:41:06.556 --> 01:41:08.457]  Well, again, it's like the electronic voting machines.
[01:41:08.477 --> 01:41:09.757]  This is from Wired Magazine.
[01:41:10.658 --> 01:41:19.341]  The Diebold emails consisted of internal correspondence sent by company employees to several staff mailing lists related to box fixes, technical support, and company announcements.
[01:41:19.701 --> 01:41:27.464]  They detailed information about the internal workings of electronic voting machine maker and pointed to difficulties with the company's machines cited by employees and election officials.
[01:41:27.924 --> 01:41:35.127]  Among revelations contained in the memos was information about the Microsoft Access database used by Diebold's system to collect and calculate votes...
[01:41:35.959 --> 01:41:36.440]  We're good to go.
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:42:00.665]  My point is, is they've caught these companies in elections, scamming it, and it's not on the nightly news, Eric.
[01:42:00.705 --> 01:42:02.026]  It's the same thing.
[01:42:02.406 --> 01:42:04.848]  Massive stuff going on in plain view.
[01:42:05.048 --> 01:42:06.790]  The average person has no idea.
[01:42:07.230 --> 01:42:07.510]  Right.
[01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:13.255]  This is one of the things that's, you know, when they created America, they had no idea television would ever exist.
[01:42:14.956 --> 01:42:17.338]  Our Constitution is going to have to be redone to deal with this.
[01:42:17.358 --> 01:42:19.159]  This is, like, incredible.
[01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:22.482]  Television is more addictive than heroin or cocaine.
[01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:24.852]  It has such control over people.
[01:42:25.512 --> 01:42:32.518]  And not only does it have control over them, but there are some people that will look at my book and think, wow, this really was a scam.
[01:42:32.798 --> 01:42:38.083]  But through the weeks of watching TV, they slowly get pulled back into the crowd of sheep.
[01:42:39.938 --> 01:42:40.319]  Exactly.
[01:42:40.359 --> 01:42:44.841]  I talk to thousands of people who go, yeah, you're right about this, but there's nothing we can do.
[01:42:45.061 --> 01:42:48.522]  And the average adult watches three hours and 46 minutes of TV.
[01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:49.523]  It's a two-year-old study.
[01:42:49.583 --> 01:42:50.944]  I'm told it's worse now.
[01:42:51.864 --> 01:42:54.565]  Three-plus hours.
[01:42:54.745 --> 01:42:58.027]  An average child watches over four and a half hours.
[01:42:58.087 --> 01:42:59.047]  This is incredible.
[01:42:59.548 --> 01:42:59.808]  Right.
[01:42:59.828 --> 01:43:02.749]  It's like a drug, and it has such control over people.
[01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:06.811]  And, of course, people also have a tendency to follow each other anyway.
[01:43:07.546 --> 01:43:19.816]  So, I mean, this is something that our country should have... Of course, they had no idea it was coming, but, I mean, this control of the media, whoever has control of the television has control over the majority of people.
[01:43:20.536 --> 01:43:24.880]  And the rest of us are just like in that Matrix movie saying, hey, what's going on?
[01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:26.821]  This is ridiculous, you guys.
[01:43:27.602 --> 01:43:34.747]  You know, it's like we're a small group trying to wake people up, and they're just in this fantasy world created for them by television.
[01:43:35.288 --> 01:43:35.488]  Now...
[01:43:36.346 --> 01:43:40.549]  The engineering professors, the designer of the building, they suddenly shut up real quick.
[01:43:40.569 --> 01:43:48.154]  The firefighters, like Luke Caccioli, who was in People Magazine the week after saying that there were bombs going off, I talked to him.
[01:43:48.174 --> 01:43:50.355]  He said, I've been told not to talk and hung the phone up.
[01:43:50.756 --> 01:43:53.777]  Why do you think they're telling him not to talk and declaring national security?
[01:43:54.138 --> 01:43:58.120]  They said that all the firefighter radios malfunctioned, but it turns out none of them did.
[01:43:58.401 --> 01:43:59.801]  The feds have grabbed those radios.
[01:43:59.821 --> 01:44:00.642]  I wonder why, Eric.
[01:44:01.142 --> 01:44:05.105]  Well, yeah, they confiscated a lot of information and a lot of people did get quiet and
[01:44:05.615 --> 01:44:11.382]  You have to wonder what, you know, obviously there's no reason to keep quiet if there's nothing to hide.
[01:44:12.102 --> 01:44:17.529]  Secrecy only helps you when you're trying to commit some sort of a scam.
[01:44:17.889 --> 01:44:21.353]  Also, there's a company called Controlled Demolition.
[01:44:22.265 --> 01:44:29.791]  Control demolition did the control demolition, pun intended, of Oklahoma City a few weeks after the bombing.
[01:44:29.811 --> 01:44:30.952]  They wouldn't let anybody in.
[01:44:31.232 --> 01:44:37.017]  They took the remains to a landfill, poured concrete in with it, and have armed Wackenhut guards to this day.
[01:44:37.717 --> 01:44:39.479]  What is it, seven, eight years later?
[01:44:39.839 --> 01:44:40.860]  We have that going on.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:50.247]  They're the company that took all the metal and hauled it to China, and the oldest firefighting group, firefighter engineers, went public and said this is a cover-up.
[01:44:50.627 --> 01:44:52.088]  And they also said it's a crime.
[01:44:52.108 --> 01:44:58.714]  He even said, we looked through the laws trying to find an exception, and there's no exception.
[01:44:58.734 --> 01:45:00.756]  You are not allowed to destroy that rubble.
[01:45:02.775 --> 01:45:05.677]  You can see the difference between the rubble of the space shuttle.
[01:45:05.697 --> 01:45:08.119]  You were told, don't touch that stuff or you're going to jail.
[01:45:08.339 --> 01:45:16.885]  I interviewed a United Press International reporter about two weeks after the attacks who was arrested for taking photos.
[01:45:16.905 --> 01:45:17.545]  Remember FEMA?
[01:45:17.945 --> 01:45:18.185]  Right.
[01:45:18.646 --> 01:45:20.447]  Banned all photography of the rubble?
[01:45:20.887 --> 01:45:21.127]  Right.
[01:45:21.188 --> 01:45:22.789]  Yeah, they were trying to keep people away from it.
[01:45:23.409 --> 01:45:25.410]  Why would you ban photography of the rubble?
[01:45:26.171 --> 01:45:27.712]  Yeah, they did the same with that Flight 93.
[01:45:28.052 --> 01:45:30.434]  They arrested a couple of photographers over there, too.
[01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:33.371]  They don't want you to see it, and there's only one reason.
[01:45:33.931 --> 01:45:37.552]  Remember, secrecy only helps you if you're trying to commit a crime.
[01:45:37.632 --> 01:45:39.293]  It doesn't help you if you're honest.
[01:45:39.913 --> 01:45:43.654]  So you have to ask yourself, when the government acts this way, there's got to be a reason.
[01:45:44.474 --> 01:45:47.275]  And the reason is they don't want you to know the truth, obviously.
[01:45:48.035 --> 01:45:51.596]  Now, again, there's just so many facts in your book and your film.
[01:45:51.616 --> 01:45:59.058]  I want to take calls, Eric, but, I mean, where should we, what are some of the other points that we should go over?
[01:45:59.078 --> 01:46:00.639]  I mean, it's an orgy of evidence here.
[01:46:01.517 --> 01:46:02.697]  Oh, yeah.
[01:46:02.737 --> 01:46:04.658]  Well, there's so much thing.
[01:46:04.898 --> 01:46:05.598]  I know there's so much.
[01:46:05.618 --> 01:46:07.639]  It's so obvious that something's wrong here.
[01:46:07.659 --> 01:46:19.342]  You have also the attack on the Pentagon, the complete lack of any dead bodies from the Flight 93, or the suitcases, the plane parts.
[01:46:19.422 --> 01:46:21.703]  I mean, there's nothing at that site either.
[01:46:22.839 --> 01:46:29.027]  And then you have all these strange coincidences, like it hit the empty section of the Pentagon, flying a few inches above the ground.
[01:46:29.167 --> 01:46:31.950]  It flew in a manner that nobody can even fly an airplane.
[01:46:32.691 --> 01:46:35.615]  And then it hits an area where there's hardly anybody in it anyway.
[01:46:36.516 --> 01:46:40.241]  So you have also that Pentagon thing, which is very suspicious.
[01:46:41.471 --> 01:46:51.659]  This is the most photographed building, most surveilled in the world, and all they've got is four frames from a camera with an explosion.
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:57.924]  And, again, Eric, when we look at this, by no one can fly at that rate.
[01:46:57.964 --> 01:47:05.229]  You have to slow down, put down your flaps, tip the plane up, come in at a slow speed to land one of those jets.
[01:47:05.630 --> 01:47:08.492]  But in this case, it's at 500 and something miles an hour.
[01:47:09.167 --> 01:47:23.298]  Going super fast, a few dozen feet off the ground, maybe, T-boning the Pentagon perfectly, then the Pentagon doesn't even collapse in on itself until later in the day when they spray all the water on it and they can't find a single piece of it.
[01:47:23.698 --> 01:47:30.983]  Right, and then they send dogs in there to search for people, and the dog has got this blank expression on his face in every photograph you look at.
[01:47:31.003 --> 01:47:35.267]  I mean, how could a dog not find pieces of 64 people?
[01:47:35.287 --> 01:47:36.968]  That's a tremendous amount of people.
[01:47:37.697 --> 01:47:42.000]  This dog is like clueless, which is only a sign that there were no bodies there.
[01:47:42.661 --> 01:47:44.122]  That's how come it didn't see any.
[01:47:44.642 --> 01:47:59.953]  Well, by the way, my dad had to do some of the identification because they were matching people by medical records back in, what was it, 84, 86, when that jet full of like 200-something people ran into that building at DFW.
[01:48:01.054 --> 01:48:02.115]  And he had to go...
[01:48:03.368 --> 01:48:04.989]  Let's just say examine the bodies.
[01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:06.831]  And that thing burned.
[01:48:06.851 --> 01:48:07.992]  That thing exploded.
[01:48:08.012 --> 01:48:09.453]  That thing ran into a huge building.
[01:48:09.493 --> 01:48:15.478]  And only the pilots were unidentifiable by anything but their dental records.
[01:48:16.619 --> 01:48:16.999]  Oh, yeah.
[01:48:17.119 --> 01:48:21.602]  It's sort of ridiculous to assume that building a plane like that, 120 tons or whatever, can...
[01:48:23.889 --> 01:48:24.349]  We're good to go.
[01:48:24.389 --> 01:48:24.929]  We're good to go.
[01:48:47.302 --> 01:48:48.483]  Aluminum oxide.
[01:48:48.623 --> 01:48:53.906]  By the way, in the photos and video after it just happened, it was green grass right up to the building.
[01:48:54.326 --> 01:49:04.252]  The first thing they did four hours into it was to bring tons of sand to dump sand on the ground to make it look like it was all blown up.
[01:49:04.972 --> 01:49:05.773]  Yeah, it could have been.
[01:49:06.013 --> 01:49:11.356]  It also may have been that they just wanted to bring in... They were sinking into the grass also, but...
[01:49:12.325 --> 01:49:18.609]  I mean, the whole thing, you look at that grass, they're making jokes in France about it's like a golf course, you could go golfing on it.
[01:49:19.509 --> 01:49:26.793]  This is after a plane hits it, and jet fuel's flying all over, people are flying all over, and yet you can't see anything on the grass.
[01:49:27.154 --> 01:49:29.695]  I mean, this is so silly, and then there's no hole in the building.
[01:49:30.516 --> 01:49:34.558]  So the whole Pentagon attack is really silly, but...
[01:49:35.453 --> 01:49:38.275]  It's a difficult one for most people to deal with.
[01:49:38.535 --> 01:49:45.941]  Well, that's why you spend some time, mainly you spend it on Building 7 and the towers, and this is a whole area of research.
[01:49:45.981 --> 01:49:48.683]  Again, you wrote a book and made a whole film just about that.
[01:49:49.364 --> 01:50:03.475]  Then, you know, we do it as service if we don't also mention public officials told not to fly, NORAD standing down, bin Laden's being flown out of the country, Bush ordering FBI not to stop al-Qaeda, W199, insider trading by the government.
[01:50:04.284 --> 01:50:04.544]  U.S.
[01:50:04.584 --> 01:50:08.706]  troops massing into Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, on and on and on.
[01:50:08.826 --> 01:50:13.508]  CIA running drills of flying planes into buildings that day, ordering NORAD to stand down.
[01:50:14.328 --> 01:50:15.029]  Stay there, sir.
[01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:18.410]  We'll come right back with Eric Huffman, and we'll take your calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:50:21.909 --> 01:50:26.254]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:26.434 --> 01:50:30.860]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:35.405]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:50:35.445 --> 01:50:36.766]  The New World Order.
[01:50:37.487 --> 01:50:38.548]  Can emerge.
[01:50:38.569 --> 01:50:42.793]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:42.853 --> 01:50:49.781]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:49.921 --> 01:50:51.904]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:52.304 --> 01:51:02.630]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:02.910 --> 01:51:08.273]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:53:33.303 --> 01:53:36.925]  All right, we're going to keep Eric Hupschman in the next hour if he can stay with us.
[01:53:37.145 --> 01:53:47.908]  We're about to go to Art and Stuart and Dan and James and Rick and others that are patiently holding.
[01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:50.250]  We're good to go.
[01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.430]  I think?
[01:54:10.747 --> 01:54:11.948]  We're good to go.
[01:54:11.968 --> 01:54:12.808]  We're good to go.
[01:54:32.441 --> 01:54:33.502]  That they can't answer.
[01:54:33.582 --> 01:54:35.763]  We know their side of the story is a lie.
[01:54:36.103 --> 01:54:38.965]  We know the wildest conspiracy theory is to believe what they're saying.
[01:54:38.985 --> 01:54:43.448]  I mean, this is even crazier than the lone assassin magic bullet.
[01:54:44.088 --> 01:54:46.309]  Let's go ahead and talk to Art in Tennessee.
[01:54:46.329 --> 01:54:47.890]  You're on the air with Eric Huffman.
[01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:48.311]  Go ahead.
[01:54:48.911 --> 01:54:51.513]  Alex, we're listening in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.
[01:54:52.253 --> 01:54:58.177]  And David Wynn Miller has a video out with an explanation of what happened.
[01:54:58.817 --> 01:55:02.039]  He says it was an electromagnetic impulse.
[01:55:02.836 --> 01:55:06.038]  Which turns steel and concrete into dust, into powder.
[01:55:06.159 --> 01:55:07.079]  You know, I'm going to say this.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:10.922]  We know that public officials were told not to fly.
[01:55:10.982 --> 01:55:14.144]  We know Bush signed an order ordering the FBI not to stop al-Qaeda.
[01:55:14.184 --> 01:55:15.906]  We know that they created al-Qaeda.
[01:55:15.946 --> 01:55:16.926]  We know all of that.
[01:55:16.966 --> 01:55:20.549]  We know the buildings fell, in some cases, faster than gravity.
[01:55:21.170 --> 01:55:23.051]  We know Building 7 wasn't hit by an aircraft.
[01:55:23.071 --> 01:55:25.233]  We know they're having trouble explaining the Pentagon.
[01:55:25.893 --> 01:55:26.854]  We know all that.
[01:55:26.954 --> 01:55:31.017]  To get into electromagnetic pulses, or was there something on the belly of the plane...
[01:55:31.992 --> 01:55:36.973]  That is, again, getting off into the edge of things we can't prove, Art.
[01:55:39.154 --> 01:55:41.355]  Well, I was just wondering if you were aware of it.
[01:55:41.395 --> 01:55:45.436]  He said the furniture was all changed a month prior to 9-11.
[01:55:46.156 --> 01:55:49.237]  It contained the electronics to pull this off.
[01:55:49.997 --> 01:55:52.538]  You might check his video out and see what you think about it.
[01:55:52.878 --> 01:55:55.919]  It's like arguing over what type of bullet hit John Kennedy.
[01:55:55.959 --> 01:55:59.900]  I mean, it's a scam regardless of whether it was lead or copper or steel.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:02.121]  It doesn't really change much.
[01:56:03.201 --> 01:56:09.403]  You know, whether they had explosives or what type of explosives, those buildings did not come down because of Osama.
[01:56:09.443 --> 01:56:12.064]  They came down because somebody in the U.S.
[01:56:12.104 --> 01:56:13.384]  government allowed it to happen.
[01:56:14.005 --> 01:56:14.746]  I agree with that.
[01:56:15.386 --> 01:56:17.947]  How did Osama bin Laden order NORAD to stand down?
[01:56:18.368 --> 01:56:20.369]  How did Osama bin Laden do the insider trading?
[01:56:20.409 --> 01:56:22.970]  How did Osama bin Laden sign W1999?
[01:56:23.231 --> 01:56:28.334]  How did Osama bin Laden get the bin Ladens and the Saudi Royals flown out when all their air traffic was grounded?
[01:56:28.734 --> 01:56:30.175]  How did they do that?
[01:56:30.495 --> 01:56:34.898]  How did they have the CIA run a drill that morning of flying hijacked jets into buildings?
[01:56:36.639 --> 01:56:40.201]  Well, it had to be somebody in the USA to have the knowledge to pull this off.
[01:56:41.050 --> 01:56:41.510]  I know this.
[01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:43.351]  Those buildings evaporated.
[01:56:43.731 --> 01:56:44.791]  You say hundreds of feet.
[01:56:44.831 --> 01:56:46.171]  It was thousands of yards.
[01:56:46.512 --> 01:56:48.872]  White plumes shooting out.
[01:56:49.732 --> 01:56:58.175]  If you'll notice in the USA Today picture that they put out, with all the dust flying everywhere, all the paper was just floating around.
[01:56:58.235 --> 01:57:00.435]  The paper wasn't burned or anything.
[01:57:00.956 --> 01:57:01.536]  Absolutely.
[01:57:01.576 --> 01:57:02.796]  Great points, Art.
[01:57:03.436 --> 01:57:08.178]  I guess up next is... Who's up next?
[01:57:09.058 --> 01:57:09.658]  Who in Virginia?
[01:57:10.519 --> 01:57:11.440]  Stuart, you're on the air.
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:11.880]  Go ahead.
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:12.300]  Great.
[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:17.943]  Mr. Huffschmidt, I think your documentaries are right on target.
[01:57:18.323 --> 01:57:24.566]  In a discussion I had with a high-ranking officer the other day, I kind of stumbled at a point.
[01:57:24.606 --> 01:57:31.090]  He objected that Building 7 had these tremendous reservoirs of oil for the generator station there.
[01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.530]  Right.
[01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:35.272]  That that is what brought it down, and I had a second question about the Pentagon, but...
[01:57:35.956 --> 01:57:41.758]  What's your... Well, the idea that the oil brought it down, that still there's no explanation for how that did it.
[01:57:41.918 --> 01:57:43.778]  How does burning oil do it?
[01:57:43.798 --> 01:57:49.019]  I mean, how does burning oil cause a building to fall, and especially in the manner in which it fell?
[01:57:49.119 --> 01:57:51.900]  Yeah, it didn't explode out like a demolition.
[01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:52.900]  It collapsed.
[01:57:53.781 --> 01:57:54.301]  Stay there.
[01:57:54.501 --> 01:57:55.261]  Stay there, Stuart.
[01:57:56.501 --> 01:57:58.882]  Ask him, did the oil make NORAD stand down?
[01:58:00.102 --> 01:58:01.863]  Did it make Bush sign W1999?
[01:58:03.658 --> 01:58:04.419]  Just incredible.
[01:58:05.059 --> 01:58:06.200]  So stay there, Stuart.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:08.742]  We'll come back to you and others in the third hour.
[01:58:08.782 --> 01:58:09.522]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:12.004 --> 01:58:12.524]  Hello, folks.
[01:58:12.604 --> 01:58:15.467]  Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey replacement elements.
[01:58:15.727 --> 01:58:19.249]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:58:19.329 --> 01:58:29.917]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed... You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:37.318 --> 01:58:37.958]  Big Brother.
[01:58:38.638 --> 01:58:39.659]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:40.399 --> 01:58:41.499]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:42.159 --> 01:58:42.959]  You want answers?
[01:58:43.739 --> 01:58:45.660]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:48.940]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:49.481 --> 01:58:53.601]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:59:00.583 --> 01:59:02.383]  Music
[01:59:07.512 --> 01:59:09.195]  Alright folks, we're into the third hour.
[01:59:09.215 --> 01:59:12.459]  We're talking to a documentary filmmaker and author, Eric Hufschwan.
[01:59:12.499 --> 01:59:13.380]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:16.044 --> 01:59:22.112]  And we're going over the fact that Building 7 wasn't hit by an aircraft, but it imploded and fell down symmetrically.
[01:59:23.469 --> 01:59:28.093]  In about, what, 3.1 seconds or faster than a bowling ball would fall.
[01:59:28.533 --> 01:59:38.061]  Only by blowing out the lower floors can something like this happen, by basically evaporating the lower floors, then the building isn't as tall and falls.
[01:59:39.122 --> 01:59:43.085]  We also have people saying, well, the jet fuel in the other buildings caused this.
[01:59:43.105 --> 01:59:48.890]  Well, the firefighters, this has been in the New York Daily News, before they were told to shut up by a federal gag order,
[01:59:50.111 --> 01:59:52.153]  And the feds claim their radios malfunctioned.
[01:59:52.173 --> 01:59:53.473]  That's why they couldn't release the tapes.
[01:59:53.493 --> 01:59:54.834]  Turns out that was all lies.
[01:59:54.854 --> 01:59:55.915]  This is now all admitted.
[01:59:57.396 --> 01:59:58.917]  They said the fires were almost out.
[01:59:58.937 --> 02:00:01.318]  There were people walking around where the planes had crashed.
[02:00:01.338 --> 02:00:02.319]  There was no problem.
[02:00:03.459 --> 02:00:07.622]  The fires were only in some of the upper floors and were again going out.
[02:00:08.863 --> 02:00:09.743]  This is on the record.
[02:00:09.783 --> 02:00:12.845]  But then the fires caused the pancaking and the whole thing to fall apart.
[02:00:12.885 --> 02:00:14.006]  It melted the steel.
[02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:24.575]  Despite the fact that jet fuel burns at about 1,100 degrees and to melt steel at least 1,800 degrees, this is all scientific fact.
[02:00:25.287 --> 02:00:25.727]  We're good to go.
[02:00:25.747 --> 02:00:25.908]  I think?
[02:00:46.051 --> 02:00:50.252]  So any type of psychological gymnastics to deny what's happening.
[02:00:51.073 --> 02:01:00.715]  Stewart in Virginia was saying he talked to a high-level military officer who said it was all the oil, the coal oil, which burns, by the way, very cold.
[02:01:01.095 --> 02:01:05.517]  And coal oil doesn't explode unless you put an explosive in it.
[02:01:05.817 --> 02:01:06.957]  It just burns.
[02:01:07.877 --> 02:01:10.198]  But go ahead, Stewart, and comment further.
[02:01:10.598 --> 02:01:13.859]  This was all part of a general officer briefing.
[02:01:14.742 --> 02:01:20.284]  Made available to flag-ranked personnel, I guess, retired and others in the Washington area.
[02:01:20.704 --> 02:01:23.405]  They gave them a briefing of how the buildings came down?
[02:01:23.545 --> 02:01:23.785]  Yes.
[02:01:24.365 --> 02:01:42.831]  And the other feature I wanted to ask Mr. Huffschmidt about was it was claimed that the density of the metal used in the avionics, like the radar and everything in the nose cone of that alleged airliner, was able to penetrate through all those concrete walls into I don't know what ring of the Pentagon, you know,
[02:01:43.447 --> 02:01:44.227]  You have that picture?
[02:01:44.247 --> 02:01:49.689]  Well, yeah, they have a picture of no real hole, but then where is the plane then?
[02:01:49.809 --> 02:01:55.552]  If it went inside, if it did penetrate, there's nothing inside of it either.
[02:01:56.152 --> 02:01:59.173]  All the photos, all they show is office furniture and building materials.
[02:01:59.233 --> 02:02:03.975]  Yeah, I've seen video of inside with the open hole in the wall, and there's nothing.
[02:02:04.015 --> 02:02:05.515]  There's furniture still sitting there.
[02:02:06.416 --> 02:02:09.317]  Do you have any feel at all for what was carried away under that tarp?
[02:02:10.431 --> 02:02:12.332]  No, absolutely.
[02:02:12.752 --> 02:02:14.533]  They're not letting any information out.
[02:02:14.573 --> 02:02:16.874]  The military has got to be the most secret organization.
[02:02:17.414 --> 02:02:27.658]  By the way, this is the same military that plants hundreds of fake letters from the troops, how much they love the war, and claims that Niger sold uranium and puts out fake documents.
[02:02:28.178 --> 02:02:34.521]  It all rather reminds me of Isaiah's criticism of Israel in his time that she was corrupt from the head to the toe.
[02:02:36.138 --> 02:02:44.224]  The high-ranking people and the lower orders are quite cheerful to follow the higher-ranking people onto imperialistic adventures around the world.
[02:02:44.404 --> 02:02:45.405]  Well, I want to know this.
[02:02:45.505 --> 02:02:47.526]  It's the most surveilled area in the world.
[02:02:47.806 --> 02:02:49.808]  Where is the video of the plane?
[02:02:50.748 --> 02:02:55.251]  If they're keeping it a secret, they've got it, and they only let us see a couple frames.
[02:02:55.271 --> 02:02:57.112]  Well, look, they declared national security.
[02:02:57.152 --> 02:02:58.673]  I've had the lawyers on who sued.
[02:02:59.214 --> 02:03:04.838]  In the Oklahoma City bombing, they had over a dozen videotapes of specifically that truck.
[02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:11.702]  But again, they've got the tapes, national security, on Oklahoma City, they will not release them.
[02:03:12.982 --> 02:03:20.384]  It's incredible to me that no general officers slapped their thighs and said, this is ridiculous, what kind of idiots do you think we are at that briefing?
[02:03:21.045 --> 02:03:25.966]  Well, some of them may have, and see, what I'm thinking is happening... Hey, I'll tell you what, stay there, Stewart.
[02:03:26.166 --> 02:03:27.267]  Are you in the military, Stewart?
[02:03:28.987 --> 02:03:29.367]  Stay there.
[02:03:29.487 --> 02:03:30.068]  Stay there, Eric.
[02:03:30.088 --> 02:03:30.668]  Stay there, Stewart.
[02:03:30.688 --> 02:03:31.248]  We'll talk more.
[02:03:32.762 --> 02:03:35.282]  Do you realize about the quality of air outside these days?
[02:03:35.382 --> 02:03:35.863]  Pollution.
[02:03:35.903 --> 02:03:36.183]  Pollen.
[02:03:36.223 --> 02:03:37.323]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[02:03:37.403 --> 02:03:37.823]  Allergies.
[02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:38.243]  Asthma.
[02:03:38.263 --> 02:03:38.863]  Probably not.
[02:03:38.983 --> 02:03:39.703]  Well, listen to this.
[02:03:39.943 --> 02:03:48.905]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[02:03:48.985 --> 02:03:49.805]  Six to ten times.
[02:03:49.845 --> 02:03:50.905]  How can that be, you ask?
[02:03:50.985 --> 02:03:51.245]  Worse.
[02:03:51.345 --> 02:03:52.686]  Think about what's inside your home.
[02:03:52.846 --> 02:03:53.506]  Air spray.
[02:03:53.606 --> 02:03:54.126]  Chemicals.
[02:03:54.406 --> 02:03:55.106]  Does anyone smoke?
[02:03:55.146 --> 02:03:55.426]  Fumes.
[02:03:55.546 --> 02:03:57.206]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[02:03:57.666 --> 02:03:59.227]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[02:03:59.267 --> 02:04:00.007]  Toxic fumes.
[02:04:00.027 --> 02:04:00.947]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[02:04:02.904 --> 02:04:03.424]  Into you.
[02:04:03.664 --> 02:04:04.465]  Into your children.
[02:04:04.505 --> 02:04:05.045]  Their lungs.
[02:04:05.145 --> 02:04:05.926]  Am I scaring you?
[02:04:06.246 --> 02:04:07.146]  Remember this word.
[02:04:07.546 --> 02:04:08.287]  Puritech.
[02:04:08.327 --> 02:04:09.848]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[02:04:09.908 --> 02:04:12.089]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[02:04:12.249 --> 02:04:24.795]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[02:04:24.895 --> 02:04:26.176]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[02:04:26.196 --> 02:04:26.256]  888-491-4100.
[02:04:26.296 --> 02:04:27.316]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[02:04:27.436 --> 02:04:28.137]  Online at Puritech.com.
[02:04:33.550 --> 02:04:40.939]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:04:41.219 --> 02:04:45.964]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:04:46.184 --> 02:04:51.831]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:54.013]  ...and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:05:18.371 --> 02:05:23.640]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:24.061]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:33.629 --> 02:05:38.152]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:05:38.492 --> 02:05:42.595]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:05:42.875 --> 02:05:43.436]  We listened.
[02:05:43.736 --> 02:05:48.739]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:05:48.999 --> 02:05:49.480]  We listened.
[02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:52.922]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:05:53.342 --> 02:05:53.882]  We listened.
[02:05:54.343 --> 02:05:57.685]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:05:57.745 --> 02:05:58.285]  We're good to go.
[02:06:37.396 --> 02:06:38.036]  Big Brother.
[02:06:38.697 --> 02:06:39.737]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:40.458 --> 02:06:41.579]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:42.219 --> 02:06:43.039]  You want answers?
[02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:44.680]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:49.083]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:49.543 --> 02:06:51.885]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[02:06:52.788 --> 02:06:53.668]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:53.848 --> 02:07:10.652]  All right, we had Stuart on the line from Virginia.
[02:07:10.672 --> 02:07:16.734]  I'm talking about some military briefing, and for some reason the phone line disconnected.
[02:07:16.814 --> 02:07:18.534]  So, Stuart, if you can get back through.
[02:07:19.292 --> 02:07:20.613]  Yeah, he was saying how they all fall for this, but...
[02:07:48.166 --> 02:07:48.366]  Absolutely.
[02:07:48.386 --> 02:07:48.506]  It's a...
[02:08:18.197 --> 02:08:20.038]  Real tragedy to see this happening.
[02:08:20.078 --> 02:08:22.820]  Let's go on to Dan in Illinois.
[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:24.021]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:08:24.081 --> 02:08:24.521]  Go ahead.
[02:08:25.102 --> 02:08:31.146]  Yeah, Eric, just in response to what you were just saying, it's because the society keeps turning its responsibility over to the government.
[02:08:32.346 --> 02:08:36.229]  Yeah, the voters do not want to be held responsible for anything that people don't want to be.
[02:08:36.249 --> 02:08:40.011]  I mean, even now they're trying to say when they get fat it's because of McDonald's.
[02:08:40.532 --> 02:08:40.872]  I mean, it's
[02:08:41.656 --> 02:08:42.996]  People don't want to be responsible.
[02:08:43.036 --> 02:08:45.217]  They don't want to take part in what they're supposed to be doing.
[02:09:01.042 --> 02:09:02.022]  I think we're good to go.
[02:09:02.062 --> 02:09:03.463]  I think we're good to go.
[02:09:13.962 --> 02:09:20.606]  Well, as you turn the responsibility over, you become more childish, and then they become more the parents, so it's like facing your parent head-on that they're evil.
[02:09:44.369 --> 02:09:45.810]  That's a good way of looking at it, I guess.
[02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:48.332]  They're teaching people, don't be responsible.
[02:09:48.372 --> 02:09:49.072]  You're helpless.
[02:09:49.753 --> 02:09:51.133]  Just feel sorry for yourself.
[02:09:51.514 --> 02:09:52.334]  We'll take care of you.
[02:09:52.354 --> 02:09:53.715]  That's the attitude in this country.
[02:09:55.316 --> 02:09:58.878]  How did Osama bin Laden turn off the no-fly zone in the Pentagon?
[02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:04.782]  How did he stop those stock market investigations around the world, too?
[02:10:04.822 --> 02:10:07.284]  That was another good one.
[02:10:07.384 --> 02:10:08.485]  It's just so silly.
[02:10:08.505 --> 02:10:11.366]  You guys were talking about voting before.
[02:10:11.386 --> 02:10:12.567]  I just wanted to ask you a question.
[02:10:12.907 --> 02:10:13.928]  Nobody's ever talked about this.
[02:10:14.605 --> 02:10:18.748]  That one senator that got killed in Minnesota in that airplane crash.
[02:10:18.768 --> 02:10:19.169]  Wellstone?
[02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.729]  Wellstone.
[02:10:19.889 --> 02:10:20.089]  Right.
[02:10:21.651 --> 02:10:25.834]  Mondale, the ex-vice president, ran in his place.
[02:10:26.575 --> 02:10:29.677]  And you usually get the sympathy vote of the person who just dies.
[02:10:30.398 --> 02:10:31.038]  And he loses?
[02:10:31.058 --> 02:10:33.100]  How did he lose?
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:35.782]  Yeah, that could be another one of the voting.
[02:10:36.102 --> 02:10:37.243]  Was that touch screens up there?
[02:10:37.824 --> 02:10:38.304]  I don't know.
[02:10:38.324 --> 02:10:39.125]  Here's the point.
[02:10:41.388 --> 02:10:53.835]  We have dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of local, state, and federal elections where the touchscreen companies have been caught remotely accessing and stealing elections in plain view.
[02:10:54.136 --> 02:10:59.639]  When they get caught, they say it's an accident that they illegally backdoor go in and change votes.
[02:10:59.699 --> 02:11:01.960]  They have been caught doing it.
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:04.942]  It isn't they could be doing it up in Minnesota.
[02:11:05.242 --> 02:11:06.623]  They've been caught doing it.
[02:11:07.577 --> 02:11:13.961]  Well, if they can make that investigation of the plane go away, nobody's ever even looked into it, they sure can act and fix an election.
[02:11:14.021 --> 02:11:15.222]  That's the point of 9-11.
[02:11:15.242 --> 02:11:17.423]  They can assassinate a president right in front of us.
[02:11:17.464 --> 02:11:19.345]  They can steal elections right in front of us.
[02:11:19.685 --> 02:11:21.586]  They can blow up buildings right in front of us.
[02:11:22.807 --> 02:11:23.467]  We're good to go.
[02:11:45.265 --> 02:11:50.468]  And that morning, they're running a drill of the same thing in the exact areas of New York and D.C.
[02:11:50.828 --> 02:11:53.770]  And again, the drill is the way to order NORAD to stand down.
[02:11:55.131 --> 02:11:55.391]  Right.
[02:11:56.032 --> 02:12:04.577]  I need Steve or Stuart to call back in, because we accidentally disconnected him during that break, and I want to hear about this military briefing he was in, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:12:04.597 --> 02:12:08.399]  Dan, thanks for the call.
[02:12:08.419 --> 02:12:10.000]  Go ahead, Eric.
[02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:13.222]  Oh, yeah, I was going to say, I have to agree with you, and it's
[02:12:14.164 --> 02:12:26.674]  I forgot what I was going to say, but it's just shocking that they're not only getting away with it, but then they feed people the TV, and that meeting that he was talking about may be to just put the ideas in everyone's mind.
[02:12:26.694 --> 02:12:34.380]  Oh, here's what Building 7 was, so that when they hear any alternative opinion, they've already been told what's official, and they already know what's official.
[02:12:35.001 --> 02:12:37.903]  So then, you know, by feeding people the lie first...
[02:12:38.897 --> 02:12:42.678]  Anything that comes in after it is now, like, contradicting the authority.
[02:12:42.778 --> 02:12:52.460]  Well, I had Stanley Hilton, Bob Dole's former chief of staff, the guy who has 400-plus families represented by him, suing Bush for running 9-11, not for prior knowledge.
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:13:03.162]  He's deposed all these colonels and generals and people because they had to answer his questions in that deposition about how NORAB was ordered to stand down.
[02:13:03.832 --> 02:13:04.352]  You're good to go.
[02:13:24.238 --> 02:13:41.270]  And then on top of this, to get out ahead of the story, two weeks after we break it here, suddenly, we put out a transcript of it, went all over the internet, got tens of millions of readers with Hilton saying this, suddenly the AP comes out, oh yeah, there was a drill that morning of flying hijacked jets into buildings.
[02:13:43.932 --> 02:13:45.493]  You understand how that gets out ahead of it?
[02:13:46.194 --> 02:13:49.056]  So now if it comes out, they go, oh, it was just a drill, see?
[02:13:49.896 --> 02:13:53.219]  Right, they feed everything first that they want you to know.
[02:13:54.016 --> 02:13:56.417]  And then anything that comes after it is contradicting them.
[02:13:56.457 --> 02:13:58.759]  So it's a good way to get going, you know, get something going.
[02:13:58.779 --> 02:14:01.700]  Well, I mean, it's open damage control.
[02:14:02.020 --> 02:14:02.220]  Right.
[02:14:02.381 --> 02:14:09.825]  Hilton's making these allegations, and then they try to get out ahead of it and go, yeah, yeah, we were running a drill that morning at 8.30 in the morning.
[02:14:12.946 --> 02:14:14.987]  And then there's never a discussion of it.
[02:14:15.007 --> 02:14:16.128]  It's just, here's our reason.
[02:14:16.756 --> 02:14:17.637]  There's no questioning.
[02:14:17.657 --> 02:14:19.197]  I know there's no thinking.
[02:14:19.257 --> 02:14:21.879]  And that's what our schools, of course, teach, too, is don't think.
[02:14:21.919 --> 02:14:25.521]  Just sit there like a baby while we spoon-feed you with what you're supposed to know.
[02:14:25.541 --> 02:14:29.823]  I mean, there's no kicking them in the butt and saying, get to work.
[02:14:30.023 --> 02:14:30.984]  Think for yourself.
[02:14:31.404 --> 02:14:32.344]  Do some research.
[02:14:32.925 --> 02:14:33.845]  You know, just sit there.
[02:14:33.925 --> 02:14:37.507]  We'll tell you what pages to read and what to do, and we'll take care of you.
[02:14:37.807 --> 02:14:39.428]  All right, let's talk to James in Texas.
[02:14:39.488 --> 02:14:40.329]  James, you're on the air.
[02:14:40.369 --> 02:14:40.809]  Go ahead.
[02:14:40.829 --> 02:14:43.990]  Hello?
[02:14:44.271 --> 02:14:44.891]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:14:45.273 --> 02:14:46.874]  Hey, this is actually Jason.
[02:14:47.515 --> 02:14:48.656]  Okay, Jason, welcome.
[02:14:48.936 --> 02:14:49.516]  Hey, thanks.
[02:14:49.896 --> 02:14:53.899]  Listen, I've called before really quickly as far as context is concerned.
[02:14:55.140 --> 02:15:01.665]  I know that you've alluded to both the Liberty and then indirectly alluded to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:15:02.306 --> 02:15:13.194]  But there's a congressman that is near and dear to your heart that after the Oklahoma City bombing actually financed his own private investigation of the bombing.
[02:15:14.215 --> 02:15:14.355]  And
[02:15:15.131 --> 02:15:20.795]  You know, because of all the national security calls that were released on those tapes.
[02:15:22.136 --> 02:15:24.337]  But contextually speaking, this is nothing new.
[02:15:24.858 --> 02:15:37.106]  If you recall, just before the Oklahoma City bombing, there was legislation in place on domestic terrorism, and the lobbying groups did analysis and realized that there wasn't support for it.
[02:15:37.186 --> 02:15:42.850]  And then two weeks later, the next thing you know, a rider truck pulls up in front of the Murray Building in Oklahoma City and
[02:15:43.271 --> 02:15:44.151]  The thing blows up.
[02:15:44.512 --> 02:15:55.097]  Six weeks later, domestic terrorism bills pass unanimously with one or two dissenting votes, one of which was said congressman that's near and dear to your heart.
[02:15:57.599 --> 02:15:57.959]  Hello?
[02:15:58.359 --> 02:15:59.440]  It's amazing.
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:01.821]  Eric Huffman comments to what Jason's saying.
[02:16:02.441 --> 02:16:05.223]  Well, yeah, I guess he's saying basically that this goes on and on.
[02:16:06.156 --> 02:16:09.298]  In front of our faces is what I suppose he's trying to say.
[02:16:09.958 --> 02:16:15.641]  Well, yeah, I mean, basically what I'm trying to say is that was obviously during the Clinton administration.
[02:16:16.041 --> 02:16:19.023]  And, you know, September 11th was during the Bush administration.
[02:16:19.323 --> 02:16:25.426]  And, you know, I think what needs to come to an end is the dichotomy between liberal and conservative politics.
[02:16:25.486 --> 02:16:34.311]  Because, quite frankly, it doesn't matter if somebody's a self-declared liberal or somebody's a self-declared conservative, that there's an apparatus in place
[02:16:36.685 --> 02:16:44.272]  Well, that's it, Jason.
[02:16:44.312 --> 02:16:44.913]  That's a good point.
[02:16:44.933 --> 02:16:53.481]  And on top of it, I heard so-called neocon talk radio that'll tell you about the problems, but not how Republicans are going along with it or energetically getting it passed.
[02:16:53.521 --> 02:16:54.822]  It's all the Democrats are bad.
[02:16:55.263 --> 02:17:00.468]  I mean, I heard one of the big national hosts attacking Hillary, who I can't stand, who's a horrible creature.
[02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.929]  We're good to go.
[02:17:23.496 --> 02:17:36.507]  Well, the fact remains, I mean, what you need to point out, and you more or less do this on a daily basis, is that people have to basically get off of the government tit.
[02:17:37.328 --> 02:17:46.976]  I mean, as far as information is concerned, as far as corporate and private welfare is concerned, just get off of it, and the quicker that we do so,
[02:17:47.677 --> 02:17:52.221]  And the quicker that we dissolve this dependency, the quicker that this will come to an end.
[02:17:52.561 --> 02:18:07.675]  And they know that, so they're trying to get us all with psychiatric designations, they're trying to get us all on drugs, or they're trying to get us in the criminal justice system, or now they've got the national draft that they're engineering to get us all in the system, one way or another.
[02:18:08.115 --> 02:18:10.958]  Or on the flip side, what we can do is we can all get on welfare.
[02:18:11.383 --> 02:18:14.624]  And we can dissolve the government much more quickly in that capacity.
[02:18:14.664 --> 02:18:18.926]  And in doing so, you know, basically history has proven history true, just like the Roman Empire.
[02:18:19.386 --> 02:18:24.588]  It dissolves and we possibly get something that's a little bit more aligned with our, you know, our mores and values.
[02:18:24.968 --> 02:18:25.788]  I hear you, Jason.
[02:18:25.808 --> 02:18:26.449]  Interesting points.
[02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:29.150]  We'll get Eric Hubschman's take on it when we get back and take more calls.
[02:18:29.170 --> 02:18:29.570]  Stay with us.
[02:18:34.013 --> 02:18:36.234]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:18:36.655 --> 02:18:41.017]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:18:41.297 --> 02:18:47.101]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:18:47.341 --> 02:18:51.383]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:18:51.663 --> 02:18:57.306]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[02:18:57.426 --> 02:19:00.048]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:19:02.149 --> 02:19:06.052]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:19:06.092 --> 02:19:08.473]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:19:08.814 --> 02:19:11.095]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:19:11.495 --> 02:19:15.118]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:19:15.598 --> 02:19:21.802]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:19:22.242 --> 02:19:23.203]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:19:23.223 --> 02:19:24.004]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:24.024 --> 02:19:24.264]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.733 --> 02:19:38.458]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:19:38.598 --> 02:19:39.238]  Yes, it's true.
[02:19:39.258 --> 02:19:41.981]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:19:42.121 --> 02:19:46.105]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[02:19:46.185 --> 02:19:46.765]  You heard it right.
[02:19:46.925 --> 02:19:51.890]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:53.011]  The list goes on and on.
[02:19:53.271 --> 02:19:54.072]  You may miss out forever.
[02:20:10.009 --> 02:20:10.449]  We're good to go.
[02:20:32.110 --> 02:20:35.071]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:20:56.878 --> 02:21:07.340]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:08.120]  That's right.
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:15.422]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:21:15.702 --> 02:21:24.304]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:21:26.745 --> 02:21:27.226]  803-4438.
[02:21:27.386 --> 02:21:28.927]  That's toll free.
[02:21:28.947 --> 02:21:29.748]  888-803-4438.
[02:21:30.388 --> 02:21:31.529]  Oh my!
[02:21:33.671 --> 02:21:38.395]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:21:38.495 --> 02:21:42.179]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:44.561]  This is Pat Cooper.
[02:21:44.581 --> 02:21:47.023]  Tony Del Vecchio is coming to this station very soon.
[02:21:47.103 --> 02:21:47.664]  I'm sweet.
[02:21:47.704 --> 02:21:49.045]  I'd book any day now.
[02:21:49.505 --> 02:21:50.326]  You're going to love his show.
[02:21:52.071 --> 02:21:57.260]  That's all about this with your host, Tony DelVecchio, Saturday evenings from 9 to 10 p.m.
[02:21:57.300 --> 02:22:00.546]  Central Time, right here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:22:02.017 --> 02:22:02.938]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[02:22:02.958 --> 02:22:10.103]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[02:22:10.384 --> 02:22:13.266]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[02:22:13.466 --> 02:22:19.110]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[02:22:19.371 --> 02:22:21.532]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[02:22:21.712 --> 02:22:28.278]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[02:22:37.759 --> 02:22:39.680]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:42.981]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:44.362 --> 02:22:45.262]  All right, folks.
[02:22:46.283 --> 02:22:48.064]  Back live talking to Eric Hubschmidt.
[02:22:49.484 --> 02:22:50.485]  And it's not just Kennedy.
[02:22:50.525 --> 02:22:55.567]  It's not just Oklahoma City or the Second World Trade Center attack.
[02:22:55.667 --> 02:22:59.649]  It's the First World Trade Center attack where the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers.
[02:23:00.569 --> 02:23:03.070]  That was admitted in the Chicago Tribune, New York Times.
[02:23:03.090 --> 02:23:07.152]  They just calmly announced, yeah, the FBI cooked the bombs and let it go forward and
[02:23:08.863 --> 02:23:10.484]  They're real sorry about that.
[02:23:10.904 --> 02:23:20.107]  And I've got the, right here, I've got the Saudi Arabians going, hey, the MI6 is blowing stuff up over here to destabilize the country.
[02:23:20.147 --> 02:23:20.948]  We're not doing this.
[02:23:21.368 --> 02:23:27.070]  They want radical Muslims to take over, overthrow the country, so they have an excuse to come in and invade the place and take it over.
[02:23:27.850 --> 02:23:30.091]  And that's exactly what the globalists are talking about doing.
[02:23:30.971 --> 02:23:32.872]  So it's just all about war, folks.
[02:23:33.652 --> 02:23:34.933]  It's all hidden in plain view.
[02:23:36.312 --> 02:23:46.477]  Eric Hubschman, I'm sure you've heard of Donald Rumsfeld's P2OG Pentagon Group that admits they go out and kill people's families to get them to attack them so they have an excuse to target the enemy.
[02:23:47.878 --> 02:23:55.842]  I mean, this is bringing down attacks on us, real attacks, and they just love it because the cattle out there will buy into this.
[02:23:56.643 --> 02:23:58.544]  Comments, Eric, before we go to John and John?
[02:23:58.564 --> 02:24:02.746]  Well, yeah, the problem is it's easy to stimulate anger with people.
[02:24:02.886 --> 02:24:02.966]  It's
[02:24:03.635 --> 02:24:10.280]  I mean, all you do is fake a terrorist attack, but it's very difficult to stimulate responsibility or thinking.
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:19.866]  So what they're doing, basically, is just taking advantage of this weakness of human behavior and giving us fake attacks, stimulating anger, and then sending them off.
[02:24:20.087 --> 02:24:20.727]  Go over there!
[02:24:20.747 --> 02:24:21.948]  Go kill, kill, kill!
[02:24:22.719 --> 02:24:24.920]  And by the way, the Northwoods plan says that.
[02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:27.461]  Killing Americans, having lists of casualties in U.S.
[02:24:27.521 --> 02:24:31.282]  newspapers will cause a helpful wave of national indignation.
[02:24:31.642 --> 02:24:35.263]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee, then John in Kansas and others.
[02:24:35.303 --> 02:24:35.963]  Go ahead, John.
[02:24:36.583 --> 02:24:38.244]  I've seen Eric's video.
[02:24:38.324 --> 02:24:42.925]  It was really good, especially the proof that a cruise missile or a global hawk hit the Pentagon.
[02:24:43.866 --> 02:24:51.248]  And it's now so obvious that jet fuel can't melt steel buildings that a PBS special this year alleged that burning paper
[02:24:51.809 --> 02:24:53.290]  Made the World Trade Center collapse.
[02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:57.851]  And that's getting even worse because paper burns at an even lower temperature.
[02:24:58.012 --> 02:25:00.072]  Yeah, it's an oxygen stealer.
[02:25:00.132 --> 02:25:02.974]  It steals the available oxygen and then smolders.
[02:25:03.294 --> 02:25:07.095]  Has anyone ever tried to throw a bunch of newspapers into a raging outside fire?
[02:25:07.115 --> 02:25:11.837]  It can burn for 20 minutes and down on the core, it'll still be paper.
[02:25:13.418 --> 02:25:14.298]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:25:14.418 --> 02:25:17.540]  Well, it's obvious that demolition charges brought it down.
[02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:20.961]  Controlled Demolitions Incorporated and Browning Ferris Industries...
[02:25:21.687 --> 02:25:28.072]  We're paid $7 billion to clean up the World Trade Center massacre, but it only cost $1 billion to build the World Trade Center.
[02:25:28.092 --> 02:25:31.895]  And, of course, they also worked together after the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:25:32.755 --> 02:25:36.918]  And CDIs exploded 7,000 buildings, mainly for the government in Hollywood.
[02:25:37.719 --> 02:25:44.124]  And in the movie Enemy of the State, the evil director of NSA had his birthday on 9-1-1.
[02:25:45.245 --> 02:25:50.969]  And BFI's employees were convicted under the RICO Act for defrauding the World Trade Center for garbage contracts
[02:25:51.812 --> 02:26:04.061]  And for membership in the Gambino and Genovese Moff, the CEO of BFI lives near Knoxville, Tennessee, and the owners of CDI graduated from University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
[02:26:04.701 --> 02:26:08.184]  By the way, that whole thing about the trash company has been on 60 Minutes.
[02:26:08.784 --> 02:26:10.666]  Yeah, and A&E Modern Mob.
[02:26:11.366 --> 02:26:18.131]  Our Skull and Bones mayor, Victor Ashe, just dedicated a memorial to 9-1-1 in Knoxville, which is a black...
[02:26:19.171 --> 02:26:35.617]  Now, why does nobody report that the New York Daily News and Village Voice reported that Mafia Mayor Giuliani's entire family were convicted for murder, armed robbery, hijacking, car theft, extortion, and his father was a Mafia enforcer?
[02:26:36.137 --> 02:26:39.719]  Yeah, by hijacking cargo trucks.
[02:26:40.779 --> 02:26:44.060]  Yeah, and, you know, a $250,000 shipment of mercury.
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:45.661]  I mean, that's what he hijacked.
[02:26:45.681 --> 02:26:46.301]  He doesn't go...
[02:26:46.909 --> 02:26:48.990]  For carjacking on the local corner.
[02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:51.171]  You know, he goes for the big time.
[02:26:51.191 --> 02:26:52.912]  These are very serious people.
[02:26:54.592 --> 02:26:59.955]  The Nazi wealth was funneled through Prescott Bush, according to mainstream reports, right up until 1953.
[02:27:00.015 --> 02:27:01.636]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:01.716 --> 02:27:02.216]  Great points.
[02:27:02.256 --> 02:27:03.296]  Eric Huffschmidt comments.
[02:27:03.777 --> 02:27:04.417]  Well, I agree.
[02:27:04.437 --> 02:27:07.258]  I mean, the corruption is extreme.
[02:27:07.658 --> 02:27:13.461]  Part of the problem is there's so many people in this country willing to do it, and then there's an enormous number willing to ignore it all.
[02:27:13.941 --> 02:27:15.482]  And that just allows it to continue.
[02:27:15.542 --> 02:27:15.782]  It's like
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:21.403]  Watching a fire burn in your house, instead of putting it out, you just go to the TV and say, oh, what can I do?
[02:27:21.463 --> 02:27:22.304]  I'm just one person.
[02:27:22.904 --> 02:27:26.546]  See, it's this attitude that we can't do anything that's allowing this.
[02:27:26.566 --> 02:27:27.467]  But that's not true.
[02:27:27.507 --> 02:27:31.309]  Over 400 cities, four states have thrown out the Patriot Act.
[02:27:31.549 --> 02:27:35.972]  99 plus percent of the firefighters and police and medical workers have refused the smallpox shot.
[02:27:36.012 --> 02:27:40.335]  That's holding them back from launching that attack because their enforcers aren't inoculated and now give it to us.
[02:27:41.015 --> 02:27:47.400]  People are speaking up against the end of Posse Comitatus, Diebold, and the other electronic touchscreen companies are getting exposed.
[02:27:47.420 --> 02:27:47.781]  That's right.
[02:27:47.801 --> 02:27:48.441]  That's what they need.
[02:27:48.481 --> 02:27:49.462]  People are refusing.
[02:27:50.583 --> 02:27:53.445]  They're demanding organic produce and milk and meats now.
[02:27:54.046 --> 02:27:55.747]  People are waking up, Eric.
[02:27:55.847 --> 02:27:56.808]  Yeah, that's what we need.
[02:27:56.828 --> 02:27:59.530]  It's more people that realize they are not helpless.
[02:28:00.353 --> 02:28:01.474]  Stay there, Eric Kupchman.
[02:28:01.634 --> 02:28:02.294]  Amazing job.
[02:28:02.334 --> 02:28:09.679]  We'll come back, tell folks how to get the video, get into more of what's in the film, talk about the Saudi Arabians, the new report where they say the globalists are behind the terror over there.
[02:28:10.639 --> 02:28:12.300]  So are the Filipinos.
[02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:14.221]  So are the folks in Indonesia.
[02:28:14.802 --> 02:28:15.722]  We'll talk to John.
[02:28:15.762 --> 02:28:17.183]  We'll talk to Brian.
[02:28:17.203 --> 02:28:20.465]  We'll talk to Barbara and others as well.
[02:28:20.565 --> 02:28:21.346]  Stay with us.
[02:28:23.227 --> 02:28:24.147]  We're on the march.
[02:28:24.628 --> 02:28:26.249]  The empire's on the run.
[02:28:27.169 --> 02:28:29.851]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:29:10.904 --> 02:29:11.945]  Not if, but when.

[02:29:29.220 --> 02:29:29.441]  P.O.
[02:29:29.481 --> 02:29:31.243]  Box 1227 Jacksonville, Oregon 97530.
[02:29:33.086 --> 02:29:37.292]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[02:29:37.762 --> 02:29:38.442]  We're good to go.
[02:29:56.573 --> 02:29:57.193]  We're good to go.
[02:30:19.904 --> 02:30:25.149]  Call now toll-free 800-686-2237 and order the documents of freedom.
[02:30:25.449 --> 02:30:25.949]  Don't wait.
[02:30:26.250 --> 02:30:26.870]  Do it today.
[02:30:27.231 --> 02:30:27.671]  The number 800-686-2237.
[02:30:32.940 --> 02:30:35.844]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[02:30:35.864 --> 02:30:37.846]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[02:30:38.026 --> 02:30:43.652]  Cheaperhotels.com, saveonyourrentalcar.com, halfpriceairlinetickets.com.
[02:30:43.733 --> 02:30:49.539]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.
[02:30:49.679 --> 02:30:52.082]  Well, I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.
[02:30:52.222 --> 02:30:57.104]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[02:31:14.491 --> 02:31:14.831]  We're good to go.
[02:31:35.859 --> 02:31:41.882]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:31:42.503 --> 02:31:45.524]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:49.366 --> 02:31:50.267]  All right, we're back live.
[02:31:50.287 --> 02:31:52.088]  If you want to talk to Eric Huffschmidt, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:52.108 --> 02:31:55.810]  Just briefly, folks, if you want this great new video, Painful Deceptions, how did Osama...
[02:32:06.044 --> 02:32:08.786]  Bin Laden pull off such a devastating attack.
[02:32:08.906 --> 02:32:10.467]  The World Trade Center towers.
[02:32:10.847 --> 02:32:16.791]  How could both towers disintegrate into dust in short sections of steel in less than 10 seconds?
[02:32:17.152 --> 02:32:19.093]  Building 7 of the World Trade Center.
[02:32:19.593 --> 02:32:24.937]  How could this 47-story steel frame building disintegrate at 5.30 that evening?
[02:32:25.137 --> 02:32:26.198]  The attack at the Pentagon.
[02:32:26.238 --> 02:32:30.781]  How could a terrorist fly a Boeing 757 into the restricted airspace around the Pentagon?
[02:32:31.201 --> 02:32:32.142]  Where's the plane?
[02:32:32.462 --> 02:32:33.623]  Where's the video of it?
[02:32:34.551 --> 02:32:39.312]  It's so important that you get this $22 two-hour video.
[02:32:39.532 --> 02:32:45.533]  Also, the $22 book full of, I don't know, over 100 color pictures and diagrams.
[02:32:45.993 --> 02:32:47.494]  This is a lot of research.
[02:32:47.594 --> 02:32:49.154]  Incredible work went into this.
[02:32:49.614 --> 02:32:51.554]  You need to have the book and the video.
[02:32:51.714 --> 02:32:54.655]  Infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[02:32:54.675 --> 02:32:55.575]  You support Eric's work.
[02:32:55.595 --> 02:32:56.335]  You support my work.
[02:32:56.375 --> 02:33:00.056]  At the same time, you get a powerful tool to wake your friends and family up.
[02:33:00.922 --> 02:33:02.843]  Then, of course, there's my videos.
[02:33:02.863 --> 02:33:05.545]  9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[02:33:05.946 --> 02:33:13.531]  Both of those two-plus-hour videos cover government-sponsored terror and dozens of admitted examples and official U.S.
[02:33:13.551 --> 02:33:15.232]  government terror plans.
[02:33:16.733 --> 02:33:20.616]  There's also now the new film, Police State Three-Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil.
[02:33:21.528 --> 02:33:25.210]  The films are $25.95 a piece because most of them are like two and a half hours long.
[02:33:25.890 --> 02:33:29.192]  When you order three or more of any of those, they drop down to $20 a piece.
[02:33:29.772 --> 02:33:36.196]  Go to InfoWars.com, go to PrisonPlanet.com, and order the films today or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:42.839 --> 02:33:46.221]  That's 888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:33:57.208 --> 02:33:58.808]  And almost every caller that calls the show...
[02:34:25.228 --> 02:34:26.709]  Has seen my videos.
[02:34:27.149 --> 02:34:28.769]  And I ask them, I go, have you seen them?
[02:34:30.350 --> 02:34:31.291]  Did you buy them for me?
[02:34:32.271 --> 02:34:38.714]  No, it was on local access, or they showed it at my church, or my neighbor gave me a copy of a copy of a copy.
[02:34:39.234 --> 02:34:42.735]  I've had Congress people on who have announced this unbeknownst to me.
[02:34:42.995 --> 02:34:45.356]  It's having a huge effect.
[02:34:45.396 --> 02:34:46.837]  So please get the videos.
[02:34:46.877 --> 02:34:47.637]  Please take action.
[02:34:47.997 --> 02:34:51.699]  Eric Huffschmidt, with your film, Painful Deceptions,
[02:34:52.815 --> 02:34:59.697]  I know in an earlier version of the film, and I believe it's in the new version, you talk about Road to Tyranny.
[02:35:00.317 --> 02:35:03.278]  Did Road to Tyranny answer any questions for you?
[02:35:03.298 --> 02:35:04.979]  Was that a film you think is good?
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:08.720]  Eric Huffman?
[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:12.061]  The Oklahoma City thing, there was a lot of cover-ups.
[02:35:12.281 --> 02:35:22.064]  See, out here, you guys may see more because it was closer to you in Texas, but out here in California, we did not see those local news reports that you guys might have had access to, so
[02:35:22.728 --> 02:35:28.813]  You know, films like yours are providing a lot of information that we never even knew about.
[02:35:29.494 --> 02:35:34.858]  And like you say, your expression, information war, that is really what is going on here.
[02:35:34.938 --> 02:35:37.220]  It's who controls the information.
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:42.644]  And people who don't think they have any authority, you know, the people that say, oh, I'm just a little fish, what can I do?
[02:35:43.105 --> 02:35:48.929]  They can take these videos and books and then slip it into people's houses and bypass that television.
[02:35:49.350 --> 02:35:52.192]  You know, and it's in a sense like it's a soldier sneaking around
[02:35:52.765 --> 02:35:55.446]  Getting into the enemy territory and saying, here, look at this.
[02:35:55.907 --> 02:35:56.947]  And here's the difference.
[02:35:57.367 --> 02:36:00.909]  The enemy has to reapply their lies on a daily basis.
[02:36:01.430 --> 02:36:08.273]  Once we show somebody how they've been lied to, once we put the questions in their minds, they're going to seek the answers.
[02:36:08.573 --> 02:36:10.894]  They're going to start seeing the propaganda.
[02:36:11.014 --> 02:36:12.095]  I've said this over and over again.
[02:36:12.375 --> 02:36:17.478]  When you watch dramas and sitcoms, there's more propaganda there than on CNN or Fox.
[02:36:18.138 --> 02:36:19.799]  It is wall to wall.
[02:36:20.219 --> 02:36:28.184]  Start consciously looking at what they're trying to sell you, what type of mindset they're pushing, what type of government.
[02:36:28.224 --> 02:36:32.666]  I mean, Eric, I don't watch more than an hour of TV every two weeks.
[02:36:32.806 --> 02:36:37.329]  This weekend I watched three or four hours because it was vacation time and I wanted to monitor stuff.
[02:36:38.050 --> 02:36:46.898]  I saw two or three shows where torture is good, shows where homeschooling's bad, shows where guns are bad, shows where the government's good.
[02:36:46.919 --> 02:36:48.320]  I mean, it's wall to wall.
[02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:51.223]  When you watch television, do you see all the propaganda?
[02:36:51.243 --> 02:36:53.204]  Well, I never even had a TV.
[02:36:53.285 --> 02:36:54.766]  I got sick of it when I was a teenager.
[02:36:54.786 --> 02:36:58.950]  So right now I only have it just so I can see a couple of these videos like yours and some of the others.
[02:36:59.955 --> 02:37:03.057]  But I agree with you, and you should see things like the Threat Matrix.
[02:37:03.177 --> 02:37:04.457]  You talk about propaganda.
[02:37:04.477 --> 02:37:08.039]  That one's ready to get people signed up to be Homeland Security agents.
[02:37:08.479 --> 02:37:09.800]  Okay, the show Threat Matrix.
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:11.000]  Again, I will not watch it.
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:12.461]  Listeners have sent me some copies of it.
[02:37:12.481 --> 02:37:13.722]  I'm going to be reviewing them soon.
[02:37:13.762 --> 02:37:14.582]  Keep it up, folks.
[02:37:14.622 --> 02:37:18.564]  Threat Matrix, 24 with Kiefer Sutherland, In the Line of Fire, some other new show.
[02:37:19.584 --> 02:37:20.985]  I go to ABC's website.
[02:37:21.105 --> 02:37:25.167]  I read the synopsis for this week's episode, and it'll say...
[02:37:25.928 --> 02:37:30.690]  It's a very persuasive movie, but it's got all these subtle messages also in it.
[02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:31.891]  It's
[02:37:54.795 --> 02:37:56.816]  Basically, it's really blatant.
[02:37:56.896 --> 02:38:05.179]  Everybody's getting surveilled in another Threat Matrix show because I read the synopsis of it and listeners called in about it.
[02:38:05.239 --> 02:38:08.140]  It said, Billy Bob's a Gulf War veteran.
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:11.221]  He loves America, but he deals drugs.
[02:38:11.461 --> 02:38:15.662]  Because he's a drug dealer, he's arrested and his children are taken under the Patriot Act.
[02:38:15.742 --> 02:38:17.283]  Drug dealing is an act of terror.
[02:38:18.985 --> 02:38:25.570]  And then in the real world, they're using it for drug dealers and topless bars and county commissioners in zoning scams.
[02:38:26.091 --> 02:38:27.752]  See, folks, what they're doing?
[02:38:28.833 --> 02:38:31.996]  Well, it's like Jerry Bruckheimer producing the Saving Private Lynch.
[02:38:32.316 --> 02:38:37.100]  He actually consulted them on how to do that and how to phrase it and what to call it.
[02:38:38.181 --> 02:38:42.024]  This is the guy that makes Pirates of the Caribbean, folks, and Black Hawk Down.
[02:38:44.699 --> 02:38:53.143]  Well, Eric, if we just do one thing, if we just get them to think that, hey, they may be being lied to and manipulated, then if they'll just witness it, it'll be horrifying.
[02:38:53.383 --> 02:38:54.884]  That's why I can't watch TV, Eric.
[02:38:55.204 --> 02:38:58.246]  It is horrifying to know how evil they've gotten.
[02:38:58.846 --> 02:38:59.826]  Yeah, it's bad.
[02:38:59.886 --> 02:39:01.567]  Plus, it's a waste of your life anyway.
[02:39:02.268 --> 02:39:02.468]  It is.
[02:39:02.508 --> 02:39:03.828]  Let's talk to John in Kansas.
[02:39:03.848 --> 02:39:04.689]  John, thanks for holding.
[02:39:04.709 --> 02:39:05.109]  Go ahead.
[02:39:05.289 --> 02:39:06.410]  Yeah, thanks, sir.
[02:39:07.150 --> 02:39:08.130]  Pleasure to speak with you.
[02:39:09.531 --> 02:39:13.233]  This is going to blow your listeners' minds.
[02:39:13.854 --> 02:39:16.915]  This is top and Class 5 material.
[02:39:17.515 --> 02:39:18.435]  Hey, go ahead.
[02:39:19.035 --> 02:39:19.515]  Okay.
[02:39:21.236 --> 02:39:39.340]  I've talked to a physicist, yeah, I work for the government, who believes the laser beam technology was infrared, originally developed by Israel and Soviet Union, that caused the collapse of the towers.
[02:39:41.181 --> 02:39:50.764]  And Cheney and Bush have already asked Leader Daschle to limit congressional investigation.
[02:39:52.164 --> 02:39:58.026]  And he asked the Senate Committee... Well, sir, sir, sir, sir.
[02:39:58.686 --> 02:40:01.807]  Again, we know that their story's a fraud.
[02:40:01.847 --> 02:40:03.087]  We know they were involved.
[02:40:03.567 --> 02:40:08.889]  But to say it was particle beams or magnetic weapons, we can never prove that.
[02:40:08.929 --> 02:40:09.789]  It's a black hole.
[02:40:11.127 --> 02:40:12.509]  Well, actually not, Alex.
[02:40:12.749 --> 02:40:31.909]  Fire Engineering Magazine, a 125-year-old respected journal, published technical studies of major fires, recently criticized FEMA, and numerous indicators, fuel fires, as you know,
[02:40:35.826 --> 02:40:39.688]  Hey, sir, sir, I appreciate the call, John.
[02:40:40.328 --> 02:40:41.289]  I really do.
[02:40:41.309 --> 02:40:54.595]  What you're reading is firefighter engineering from two years ago, and that's in Road to Tyranny, where they said there's a cover-up and that fires couldn't do that to the buildings, but then that doesn't mean that it's particle beams.
[02:40:54.935 --> 02:40:55.515]  Eric Huffschmidt?
[02:40:55.876 --> 02:40:56.416]  Well, I agree.
[02:40:56.436 --> 02:40:59.957]  It's just like I said, it's like arguing over what kind of bullet hit Kennedy.
[02:40:59.977 --> 02:41:01.878]  I mean, it's like, what difference does it make anyway?
[02:41:02.198 --> 02:41:03.139]  It's still a scam.
[02:41:03.159 --> 02:41:03.239]  Yeah.
[02:41:04.085 --> 02:41:10.027]  So we can't really prove it no matter what, whether it was conventional explosives or particle beams.
[02:41:10.067 --> 02:41:11.008]  What difference does it make?
[02:41:11.268 --> 02:41:12.288]  It wasn't Osama.
[02:41:12.328 --> 02:41:13.169]  That's what's important.
[02:41:14.309 --> 02:41:16.030]  And so what's the sense of arguing about it?
[02:41:20.031 --> 02:41:20.772]  You know what I mean?
[02:41:20.952 --> 02:41:21.932]  To me, it's just a waste.
[02:41:22.792 --> 02:41:23.953]  Well, absolutely, Eric.
[02:41:24.013 --> 02:41:24.493]  I mean, look.
[02:41:25.473 --> 02:41:29.996]  Elaborate just in bullet points what your film covers for folks that just joined us, then we'll go on to more callers.
[02:41:30.396 --> 02:41:35.340]  Well, it goes over things like how the Pentagon, you know, the Pentagon is a very suspicious one.
[02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:36.781]  There's a lot of secrecy about it.
[02:41:37.021 --> 02:41:39.283]  There's no sign of any airplane hitting it.
[02:41:39.303 --> 02:41:40.203]  There's no sign of it.
[02:41:40.243 --> 02:41:41.144]  There's something hitting it.
[02:41:41.184 --> 02:41:48.469]  There is definitely something going on there, but it does not look like a passenger commercial jet full of people.
[02:41:49.033 --> 02:41:51.494]  So something hit it, and it goes over that.
[02:41:51.514 --> 02:41:58.977]  Well, I have some local newscast where the first witnesses were saying they saw a, quote, small commuter plane.
[02:41:59.518 --> 02:42:02.759]  Right, and some people say it sounded like a little missile.
[02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:09.442]  The witness reports do not even support the accusation that it was a large commercial plane.
[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:14.143]  They have military witnesses who are running around going, I saw a missile, I saw a missile.
[02:42:14.183 --> 02:42:19.086]  And they go, well, you know, people on the scene are notoriously, you know, off target.
[02:42:19.486 --> 02:42:23.688]  How do they not get a plane, a passenger jet, compared to a missile?
[02:42:24.049 --> 02:42:26.290]  And, yeah, people are notoriously inaccurate.
[02:42:27.111 --> 02:42:29.132]  But at the same time, where's the plane?
[02:42:29.292 --> 02:42:30.072]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:30.293 --> 02:42:31.093]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[02:42:31.153 --> 02:42:32.614]  I mean, the plane, it's too big.
[02:42:32.654 --> 02:42:38.157]  A 757 is so large, and there's so many people on it, and so many pieces to the plane.
[02:42:38.177 --> 02:42:38.818]  The engines...
[02:42:39.471 --> 02:42:43.393]  The engines alone, there's two of them, nine-foot diameter at their maximum.
[02:42:44.053 --> 02:42:46.795]  I mean, how do you lose this kind of material?
[02:42:47.375 --> 02:42:49.456]  And these are bigger than cars, those engines.
[02:42:49.676 --> 02:42:50.637]  Where are they?
[02:42:51.237 --> 02:42:58.080]  Well, also, the hole in the Pentagon is smaller than the fuselage, just the internal fuselage.
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:00.642]  Where are the marks from the wings hitting the building?
[02:43:01.182 --> 02:43:05.924]  And even the hole, we can't even see in those photos how deep it is or if it's even a real hole.
[02:43:05.944 --> 02:43:06.985]  It's so small, it's...
[02:43:07.682 --> 02:43:10.483]  It's even debatable as to whether it even is more than this.
[02:43:10.983 --> 02:43:11.963]  It's a black spot.
[02:43:12.244 --> 02:43:13.664]  Yeah, I mean, it's even debatable.
[02:43:13.704 --> 02:43:15.005]  Is that even an airplane hole?
[02:43:15.605 --> 02:43:17.565]  So you go over that, you also get into Building 7.
[02:43:18.466 --> 02:43:19.906]  And then, yeah, the towers.
[02:43:20.346 --> 02:43:27.269]  And, of course, what people really need to realize is this is a fight over who controls the news, who controls the information.
[02:43:28.049 --> 02:43:32.751]  That's what's really important for people to realize, that this is an information war.
[02:43:32.771 --> 02:43:33.671]  It's deception.
[02:43:34.301 --> 02:43:36.883]  Deception is what's being used as the weapon nowadays.
[02:43:37.323 --> 02:43:37.964]  Absolutely.
[02:43:38.164 --> 02:43:40.746]  Let's talk to Brian.
[02:43:40.926 --> 02:43:43.568]  Brian, where are you calling us from?
[02:43:44.008 --> 02:43:44.508]  Colorado.
[02:43:44.709 --> 02:43:45.329]  Good to talk to you.
[02:43:45.349 --> 02:43:45.689]  Go ahead.
[02:43:45.949 --> 02:43:46.590]  Good to talk to you.
[02:43:46.650 --> 02:43:47.611]  Hey, great guest today.
[02:43:48.111 --> 02:43:52.394]  Hey, I was wondering, was there a fire sprinkler system on the Twin Towers?
[02:43:52.414 --> 02:43:55.416]  Yes, there were, and there was also supposed to be water sprinklers.
[02:43:56.718 --> 02:43:57.118]  I think so.
[02:44:14.534 --> 02:44:26.266]  Well, I've read the transcripts of what the firefighters, the stuff that got leaked out, and then the feds had to admit, okay, the firefighter radios didn't all malfunction.
[02:44:26.286 --> 02:44:28.047]  We've declared national security on this.
[02:44:28.668 --> 02:44:33.813]  They reported the fires were almost out, right where the planes hit, that there was no problem.
[02:44:34.525 --> 02:44:36.746]  That's why the firefighters were all rushing in.
[02:44:36.986 --> 02:44:39.746]  They'd been in other building fires with fuel and stuff.
[02:44:39.766 --> 02:44:40.386]  They knew.
[02:44:40.827 --> 02:44:41.507]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:44:41.767 --> 02:44:42.407]  Oh, yeah, you're right.
[02:44:42.927 --> 02:44:45.328]  That's why they had no fear of running into this building.
[02:44:45.908 --> 02:44:48.388]  No fire ever brought a steel building down.
[02:44:48.428 --> 02:44:49.909]  They had nothing to worry about.
[02:44:50.389 --> 02:44:51.729]  And what's burning inside there?
[02:44:51.749 --> 02:44:54.050]  Just carpeting, office furniture?
[02:44:54.090 --> 02:44:55.390]  It's not like it's made of wood.
[02:44:55.410 --> 02:44:57.291]  It's got concrete on the floor.
[02:44:57.351 --> 02:44:58.751]  It's got steel in the frame.
[02:44:59.338 --> 02:45:00.359]  They had no reason to worry.
[02:45:00.379 --> 02:45:01.959]  And they get up there, they're walking around.
[02:45:02.019 --> 02:45:06.681]  Folks, they've had 50-story buildings, hotels and stuff that catch on fire, burn for three days.
[02:45:07.162 --> 02:45:07.382]  Right.
[02:45:07.402 --> 02:45:08.942]  I mean, nothing happens.
[02:45:09.683 --> 02:45:09.943]  Right.
[02:45:10.683 --> 02:45:12.444]  The concrete and the steel contain it.
[02:45:12.504 --> 02:45:15.746]  They might buckle a little and crack a little, but they don't do anything.
[02:45:16.546 --> 02:45:23.929]  And then we find out a year later that they were walking around in the fire zone of the South Tower, according to their radio report.
[02:45:24.369 --> 02:45:26.711]  But it would take 1,800 degrees to melt steel.
[02:45:26.931 --> 02:45:27.531]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:45:28.248 --> 02:45:43.958]  And the other thing is, you know, you'd think if the impact of the jets, if there was structural damage on that side of the building, either that side of the building would collapse because there wasn't damage to the opposite side of the building to speak of.
[02:45:44.779 --> 02:45:47.180]  So, you know, I'm just not buying the whole meltdown.
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:48.001]  Well, it would buckle.
[02:45:48.041 --> 02:45:49.061]  It would break in half.
[02:45:49.101 --> 02:45:50.002]  It would fall apart.
[02:45:50.102 --> 02:45:52.444]  It wouldn't just disintegrate into powder.
[02:45:53.504 --> 02:45:53.704]  Right.
[02:45:53.764 --> 02:45:54.385]  That's all I had.
[02:45:55.951 --> 02:45:56.472]  Absolutely.
[02:45:56.492 --> 02:45:59.295]  You know, I've got hundreds of hours of video that listeners sent me.
[02:45:59.535 --> 02:46:04.882]  I was recording on two VCRs, two separate channels, from like five minutes after the first plane hit.
[02:46:04.922 --> 02:46:06.203]  My phone was ringing off the hook.
[02:46:06.844 --> 02:46:08.446]  And folks, I want you to understand something.
[02:46:08.466 --> 02:46:09.227]  Good question, Brian.
[02:46:09.747 --> 02:46:10.288]  Good questions.
[02:46:10.548 --> 02:46:10.989]  Good points.
[02:46:12.679 --> 02:46:14.381]  Well, they show the whole building coming down in about 10 seconds.
[02:46:14.421 --> 02:46:17.023]  They have a big spike, and then it decreases a little.
[02:46:17.043 --> 02:46:17.543]  It's almost as if
[02:46:40.146 --> 02:46:45.049]  Again, you look at these seismic graphs, and this doesn't look like a building coming down either.
[02:46:45.770 --> 02:46:49.352]  It's coming down, first of all, much, much too fast.
[02:46:49.572 --> 02:46:50.993]  These are 1,300-foot buildings.
[02:46:51.013 --> 02:46:55.096]  There's 110 floors, and it's going down in 10 seconds.
[02:46:55.376 --> 02:46:58.558]  That's averaging 10 floors per second.
[02:46:58.758 --> 02:47:02.681]  And it actually is faster than that because it started out slow and then speeded up.
[02:47:02.761 --> 02:47:06.203]  So by the end, it's going faster than 10 floors per second.
[02:47:06.846 --> 02:47:11.851]  Well, also, before they collapse, the second when it began, they hear all these explosions.
[02:47:12.291 --> 02:47:18.256]  Up and down the building, there's little plumes shooting out that are identical to controlled demolitions in other cases.
[02:47:18.937 --> 02:47:29.206]  I mean, folks, I had an engineer on the day it happened, a friend of mine, who doesn't even believe in the New World Order, and he's an engineer, and he says, Alex, it was the most controlled demolitions I've ever seen in my life.
[02:47:30.177 --> 02:47:30.658]  Well, yeah.
[02:47:31.398 --> 02:47:34.261]  How else do you explain the pulverizing to dust?
[02:47:34.621 --> 02:47:36.363]  Barbara in Pennsylvania.
[02:47:36.403 --> 02:47:37.124]  You're on the air.
[02:47:37.184 --> 02:47:37.684]  Go ahead.
[02:47:39.686 --> 02:47:40.086]  Eric?
[02:47:40.287 --> 02:47:40.507]  Yes.
[02:47:40.647 --> 02:47:41.588]  Yes.
[02:47:43.069 --> 02:47:47.553]  It's the Pentagon crash that I am most interested in.
[02:47:48.855 --> 02:47:54.380]  So far, I've heard five different people get on radio programs and talk about it.
[02:47:55.557 --> 02:48:04.004]  And I have asked the same question and only one of these people partly answered my question and I was wondering if you could.
[02:48:04.945 --> 02:48:16.614]  On the 757 that was supposed to have crashed into the Pentagon, the manifest of passengers and flight crew, did you track any of the families down?
[02:48:17.474 --> 02:48:18.355]  No, there's only...
[02:48:19.261 --> 02:48:20.662]  A lot of these manifest.
[02:48:20.702 --> 02:48:23.685]  See, they're not even releasing the seating arrangements.
[02:48:23.705 --> 02:48:25.066]  They're keeping some of this a secret.
[02:48:25.086 --> 02:48:29.029]  There's no Arab zombies that they claim were hijackers.
[02:48:29.650 --> 02:48:31.231]  By the way, I have an answer for her.
[02:48:31.251 --> 02:48:33.873]  On the two flights, ma'am, I'll hold you over if you need me.
[02:48:34.334 --> 02:48:43.141]  On the two towers that were hit, there were exactly 20% occupancy on both of those planes.
[02:48:43.562 --> 02:48:44.282]  20% occupancy.
[02:48:44.582 --> 02:48:45.463]  How does that happen?
[02:48:45.723 --> 02:48:46.504]  Exactly 20% occupancy.
[02:48:46.544 --> 02:48:46.784]  Go ahead.
[02:48:48.283 --> 02:49:03.345]  Well, I'm wondering if the families of any of these supposedly dead people got any insurance policies?
[02:49:04.658 --> 02:49:07.199]  Got anything from the government?
[02:49:07.359 --> 02:49:09.220]  Any word or anything like that?
[02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:17.643]  Yeah, we know that they tell all the families, not just of the planes, but the buildings, that they'll sign a form waving all liability and saying they'll shut up.
[02:49:18.003 --> 02:49:19.023]  They get some money.
[02:49:20.163 --> 02:49:21.804]  Well... I'll tell you what.
[02:49:21.824 --> 02:49:22.584]  Stay there, Barbara.
[02:49:22.624 --> 02:49:23.785]  We'll come back to you in a second.
[02:49:24.725 --> 02:49:26.406]  And then I'll get to this Saudi Arabia story.
[02:49:27.326 --> 02:49:27.866]  Stay with us.
[02:49:28.026 --> 02:49:30.187]  And I appreciate Eric riding shotgun today.
[02:49:32.984 --> 02:49:37.348]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:37.528 --> 02:49:41.933]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:42.113 --> 02:49:46.477]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:49:46.517 --> 02:49:47.859]  The New World Order.
[02:49:48.639 --> 02:49:49.620]  Can emerge.
[02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:53.865]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:53.945 --> 02:50:00.872]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:50:01.012 --> 02:50:02.994]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:50:03.396 --> 02:50:13.724]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:50:13.985 --> 02:50:19.369]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:50:38.546 --> 02:50:42.649]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:50:42.929 --> 02:50:43.489]  We listened.
[02:50:43.789 --> 02:50:48.772]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:50:49.052 --> 02:50:49.533]  We listened.
[02:50:49.913 --> 02:50:52.975]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:50:53.375 --> 02:50:53.936]  We listened.
[02:50:54.396 --> 02:50:57.938]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:50:58.058 --> 02:50:58.999]  We're good to go.
[02:51:27.215 --> 02:51:30.157]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:52:40.491 --> 02:52:54.709]  On Sunday, the Pentagon, three days ago, two and a half days ago, claimed that they had killed 50-plus people in black uniforms screaming Shaddam.
[02:52:55.649 --> 02:52:56.049]  We're good to go.
[02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:29.673]  The facts that what they're saying is a fraud, that's what we can prove.
[02:53:30.394 --> 02:53:32.916]  Then you add to it all the other evidence, we know they're behind it.
[02:53:34.297 --> 02:53:36.038]  So that's the key point we're making here.
[02:53:36.078 --> 02:53:38.700]  We can endlessly speculate on things that we can never prove.
[02:53:38.720 --> 02:53:47.107]  You know, why did two of the hijackers' passports at two different crash scenes, when nothing else is found, come fluttering down into the rubble uncharred?
[02:53:47.839 --> 02:53:54.285]  Why was the deputy FBI director who just resigned and said the government's going to allow attacks as a pretext to invade Afghanistan?
[02:53:54.325 --> 02:53:55.346]  He told the foreign press that.
[02:53:55.646 --> 02:53:56.406]  John O'Neill.
[02:53:57.207 --> 02:53:59.249]  You know, why has there been an investigation of that?
[02:53:59.709 --> 02:54:01.491]  There's thousands of these questions.
[02:54:01.571 --> 02:54:02.332]  It's incredible.
[02:54:03.212 --> 02:54:05.674]  Barbara, finish up your points here with Eric Huffschmidt.
[02:54:06.355 --> 02:54:15.443]  Well, my point was that, like I said, I've heard five different people get on talk shows and talk about the Pentagon crash.
[02:54:16.085 --> 02:54:23.770]  And when I asked one of them this question, he managed to partly answer my question.
[02:54:23.790 --> 02:54:24.971]  What is your question?
[02:54:25.291 --> 02:54:29.574]  Have we contacted the victims of the flight that supposedly hit the Pentagon?
[02:54:29.734 --> 02:54:35.698]  He said that one of the people that was supposed to have been...
[02:54:36.583 --> 02:54:41.044]  On 757, the Pentagon crash is alive and walking around.
[02:54:41.284 --> 02:54:48.365]  Well, we know that nine of the 19 hijackers have been proven still alive, and the government said, okay, we were wrong, it was other people.
[02:54:49.266 --> 02:54:50.026]  Eric, comments?
[02:54:50.626 --> 02:54:51.926]  Well, it's hard to figure out.
[02:54:51.946 --> 02:54:57.807]  I mean, here again, how do you know who exactly was on the plane, who and where are they, if they're even alive?
[02:54:58.027 --> 02:55:05.889]  Some people have, like, that one government official, he says his wife, you know, Barbara Olson was on that plane, and he says she's dead.
[02:55:06.502 --> 02:55:09.423]  I mean, what are we supposed to do, call him up and say, are you telling us the truth?
[02:55:09.743 --> 02:55:11.883]  I mean, we're not going to get it even if he's lying.
[02:55:12.723 --> 02:55:21.665]  And some of the people on other passenger planes, like the sons or their wives or husbands, some of them are talking, some are complaining, some are even filing lawsuits.
[02:55:21.725 --> 02:55:27.026]  Yeah, I just read a letter to Bush from one of the victim's wives saying, Bush, I think you did it.
[02:55:27.046 --> 02:55:32.667]  Look, Stanley Hilton has 400 of the families in his lawsuit.
[02:55:32.707 --> 02:55:34.507]  He's saying Bush ran the attacks.
[02:55:35.174 --> 02:55:37.556]  Yeah, there are people contacting some of the family members.
[02:55:37.676 --> 02:55:39.017]  I personally didn't, though.
[02:55:39.377 --> 02:55:42.900]  Yeah, you just went over the scientific evidence that is inclusive in your film.
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:44.961]  I hope that answers the question for you, Barbara.
[02:55:46.863 --> 02:55:47.904]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:55:47.944 --> 02:55:48.564]  We're out of time.
[02:55:48.624 --> 02:55:51.046]  Eric Huffschmidt, I want to get you back up in the future.
[02:55:51.666 --> 02:55:53.148]  I appreciate your hard work.
[02:55:53.228 --> 02:55:54.649]  I appreciate everything you've done.
[02:55:55.209 --> 02:55:57.151]  And God bless you for your film and your book.
[02:55:57.191 --> 02:56:02.755]  You've done a smashing job defending this republic, and I hope folks will get the video and the book and spread the word.
[02:56:03.311 --> 02:56:07.572]  Well, let's hope so, because like you say, it is an information war, and that is one of the tools we have.
[02:56:08.012 --> 02:56:08.592]  Absolutely.
[02:56:08.632 --> 02:56:10.273]  Thanks for the call, and take care, my friend.
[02:56:10.293 --> 02:56:11.013]  Okay, bye.
[02:56:11.893 --> 02:56:14.293]  Saudi official blames foreigners for terror.
[02:56:14.373 --> 02:56:17.754]  Prince Abdul Rahman, by the way, they threatened the White House.
[02:56:17.774 --> 02:56:24.416]  They said, if you don't stop saying we did it, we're going to release the names of the four banks that really own Saudi Arabia who are behind the terror.
[02:56:24.436 --> 02:56:25.556]  And that's why the excise of 29 pages.
[02:56:26.756 --> 02:56:43.878]  Prince Abdul Rahim, Saudi Arabia's Deputy Minister of Defense and Aviation, says foreign hands are behind the Riyadh bombings that left scores dead, implying the attacks were not the work of Osama bin Laden or al-Qaeda network, but rather nations opposing the country's strict adherence to Islamic law.
[02:56:44.418 --> 02:56:46.899]  And which want to impose foreign domination upon the kingdom.
[02:56:47.119 --> 02:56:53.542]  He called on the armed forces to be ready to defend the country against foreign interference with all the force at their disposal.
[02:56:53.562 --> 02:57:12.869]  According to Arab News Report, the prince said the kingdom would continue to apply the law and said foreign countries stood behind recent events in an apparent reference to the November 8 bombings in Riyadh, adding that it would be regrettable if it were proven that they were friends of the kingdom.
[02:57:13.453 --> 02:57:15.135]  Threats to the bushes to back off.
[02:57:15.736 --> 02:57:17.117]  Folks, this is coming to a head.
[02:57:18.138 --> 02:57:19.459]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:57:19.499 --> 02:57:20.440]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:57:20.521 --> 02:57:21.361]  God bless you all.
