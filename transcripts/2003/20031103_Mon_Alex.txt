[00:00:03.812 --> 00:00:06.533]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:14.176]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:30.839]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:46.774]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:50.618]  Welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:50.678 --> 00:00:51.959]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:53.801]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:55.925 --> 00:01:01.972]  And over the weekend, I thought about the Iraq War, the calls to go into Syria, Iran, North Korea.
[00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:13.366]  I want to spend a substantial amount of the broadcast today not just covering the latest developments, but getting your take on it, where you think things are going to go in the next six months, the next year, the next two years.
[00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:15.247]  We're good to go.
[00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:15.407]  I think?
[00:01:15.447 --> 00:01:15.967]  We're good to go.
[00:01:44.574 --> 00:01:48.535]  Some of the other 20 may die, so that number, unfortunately, may rise.
[00:01:51.456 --> 00:02:00.038]  It's horrible what's happening, and we've lost more troops in the last year in Iraq than we lost in the first four years of the undeclared war in Vietnam from 64 to 68.
[00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:04.559]  So what's your response to this?
[00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.180]  How long do you think this is going to go on in the final equation?
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.540]  What's going to happen in Iraq?
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.561]  I'd like to hear from former and current military personnel.
[00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:14.204]  We're good to go.
[00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:49.549]  And the Pentagon's answer is to bulldoze orange groves and date groves and fig plantations, which is just turning the people against the forces that are there.
[00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.652]  Also, it's clear there are hundreds more dead soldiers than what we've been told.
[00:02:56.832 --> 00:03:02.075]  We've got a bunch of different articles on that, and then we've got the Bush administration taking action to try to suppress that.
[00:03:03.297 --> 00:03:07.240]  Curtaining off the jets when the coffins come rolling off.
[00:03:07.941 --> 00:03:09.762]  Giving code names to body bags.
[00:03:10.643 --> 00:03:13.065]  Trying to lie to the public.
[00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:17.708]  We've caught the Pentagon writing fake letters from the troops to hundreds of newspapers.
[00:03:17.748 --> 00:03:19.650]  We've caught them planning false news stories.
[00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.293]  They admitted that they're doing this with the Pentagon Office of Strategic Information.
[00:03:26.495 --> 00:03:27.696]  Where do you see it all going?
[00:03:27.756 --> 00:03:30.258]  And also we'll get into news like this one, the one in Telegraph.
[00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:34.512]  Ford used slave labor in Nazi German plants.
[00:03:35.493 --> 00:03:36.733]  Now, we've known this for decades.
[00:03:36.753 --> 00:03:38.053]  We've had guests on about this.
[00:03:38.454 --> 00:03:41.475]  So did General Motors, which owned Opel in Germany.
[00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:46.476]  We had the Rockefellers in the bushes making a bunch of money off this.
[00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:57.240]  I've talked to the B-17 pilots and P-38 lightning pilots and others who weren't allowed to bomb or strafe entire regions of Deutschland because it was owned by the bankers.
[00:03:57.944 --> 00:04:05.907]  By the British throne, by the Dutch, by the Crumps, by the Rothschilds, controlled by the Bushes as a management family.
[00:04:07.388 --> 00:04:09.609]  And here it is from the London Telegraph.
[00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.369]  So we'll be getting into that as well.
[00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.411]  Then we'll talk about where are the casualties in the Iraqi army.
[00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:17.672]  Amputees returning to duty.
[00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:20.913]  That's right, they're sending troops back into combat who've had arms and legs blown off.
[00:04:22.614 --> 00:04:24.654]  15 die, now 16 die as U.S.
[00:04:24.694 --> 00:04:25.735]  helicopter downed.
[00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:29.885]  18 die and second deadliest today for U.S.
[00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:33.286]  troops in Iraq, counting two others that died in separate incidences.
[00:04:34.487 --> 00:04:36.228]  AFP journalist detained by U.S.
[00:04:36.268 --> 00:04:37.708]  forces north of Baghdad.
[00:04:37.948 --> 00:04:39.629]  Iraqi child crushed by U.S.
[00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:40.029]  tank.
[00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.891]  Public confidence in Bush continues to fall as more American soldiers die in Iraq.
[00:04:46.032 --> 00:04:48.193]  We will be there for 10 years, says a member of parliament.
[00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:52.995]  Anti-war march draws diverse crowd in D.C.
[00:04:53.415 --> 00:04:56.336]  Venezuela's Chavez warns Costa Rica on coup plot.
[00:04:57.356 --> 00:04:59.618]  And we'll get into the real numbers of dead troops.
[00:05:00.038 --> 00:05:01.699]  New military morgue opens.
[00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:03.641]  Pentagon keeps dead out of sight.
[00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:05.742]  Bodies of 500 U.S.-U.K.
[00:05:05.762 --> 00:05:08.964]  soldiers lying in a major city of Afghanistan.
[00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:14.448]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:14.608 --> 00:05:19.052]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:19.192 --> 00:05:23.575]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:24.936]  The New World Order.
[00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:27.313]  We're good to go.
[00:05:27.373 --> 00:05:28.074]  We're good to go.
[00:05:53.692 --> 00:05:53.952]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:53.972 --> 00:05:54.993]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:09.498 --> 00:06:10.319]  Oh my God!
[00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.301]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:06:15.602 --> 00:06:16.262]  Yes, it's true.
[00:06:16.362 --> 00:06:19.043]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:06:19.183 --> 00:06:23.206]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:06:23.326 --> 00:06:23.866]  You heard it right.
[00:06:24.046 --> 00:06:29.069]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:30.671]  You may miss out forever.
[00:06:47.551 --> 00:06:48.191]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:13.024]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:07:13.304 --> 00:07:16.807]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:07:16.887 --> 00:07:20.829]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:27.213]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:27.634 --> 00:07:35.539]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:41.281]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:07:41.441 --> 00:07:45.223]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:45.583 --> 00:07:47.444]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:07:47.504 --> 00:07:49.665]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:07:49.905 --> 00:07:54.847]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:07:54.887 --> 00:08:00.429]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.211]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:07.672]  Protect your family.
[00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:15.354]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:17.075]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.775 --> 00:08:18.936]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.536 --> 00:08:20.376]  You want answers?
[00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:22.017]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:26.498]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.858 --> 00:08:30.920]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.860]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.280]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.301]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:41.442]  We're here live, of course, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:48.085]  About to launch straight into the latest developments in Iraq and the setup for World War III by the globalists.
[00:08:48.345 --> 00:08:52.527]  What former head of the CIA, Woolsey, calls World War IV.
[00:08:53.827 --> 00:09:00.150]  We'll also get into a bunch of new Big Brother news, electronic voting news, forced vaccination information.
[00:09:01.423 --> 00:09:07.167]  Going on globally, the unification for a world ID card into the UN now taking place.
[00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:14.151]  It's all coming up on this show today, tonight, this morning, depending on what area of this globe you're listening to us in.
[00:09:15.412 --> 00:09:19.535]  We're going to open the phones up for what you think is going to happen in Iraq, how this is going to play out.
[00:09:20.496 --> 00:09:22.978]  What's your ideas for an exit strategy, Arb?
[00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:29.102]  I'll tell you right now, they're going to have us pull out and bring the UN in as the saviors incrementally over the next two years.
[00:09:29.723 --> 00:09:30.904]  Though they're now talking about U.S.
[00:09:30.924 --> 00:09:34.666]  troops being there under UN command for another decade.
[00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:39.050]  Remember, the country's been under siege for 12 years, and Saddam's gone.
[00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.191]  Why can't they maintain order?
[00:09:41.692 --> 00:09:44.914]  Why was there not all the attacks at the beginning, but now they're seeing all the attacks?
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.060]  We're good to go.
[00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:17.448]  There have been Washington Post articles and AP articles and BBC News articles, but they're always piecemeal.
[00:10:17.548 --> 00:10:26.191]  Well, IBM, International Business Machines, didn't mean to administer the death camps, the slave camps in Germany with their machines.
[00:10:26.231 --> 00:10:34.394]  They didn't mean to have technicians there as late as 1943 running the machines for the Germans, and that's what the little tattoo was about.
[00:10:34.414 --> 00:10:40.716]  That was the number you fed into the machine to decide how old somebody was, how much they weighed, and how much to feed them or to go ahead and kill them.
[00:10:41.734 --> 00:10:47.136]  You know, your little cattle management system is basically what it was, slave management system.
[00:10:47.416 --> 00:10:49.277]  But they'll say, oh, IBM didn't mean it.
[00:10:49.717 --> 00:10:56.539]  Well, General Motors did own Opel Division there and did make a bunch of profits and fenced them through Switzerland and back into the U.S.
[00:10:56.599 --> 00:11:01.441]  and Brown Brother Harriman and Bush, Granddaddy Bush, Prescott Bush.
[00:11:02.742 --> 00:11:03.683]  Skull and Bones Bush.
[00:11:04.023 --> 00:11:04.984]  You know, they didn't mean it.
[00:11:05.004 --> 00:11:06.265]  It was an accident.
[00:11:06.705 --> 00:11:10.469]  And, oh, well, General Electric did a lot for the Nazis right through the war.
[00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:12.510]  But, again, they didn't mean it.
[00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.031]  And, well, yeah, it's true.
[00:11:14.052 --> 00:11:20.777]  They've had articles that the bombers weren't allowed to bomb whole sections of Deutschland because, well, those were U.S.-owned factories down there.
[00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:23.880]  On and on and on and on.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.061]  But it's always a piece here, a piece there.
[00:11:26.142 --> 00:11:27.563]  And here's another piece today.
[00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:28.704]  I need to create a...
[00:11:30.444 --> 00:11:31.164]  We're good to go.
[00:11:59.938 --> 00:12:02.721]  Making equipment for Nazi military, according to a new book.
[00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:12.269]  Although it has long been known that Henry Ford, the company's founder, held anti-Semitic views, the extent of his involvement in Hitler's rise to power is in dispute.
[00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:17.334]  Now, funny, you had the Rothschilds, who are supposedly Jewish, who financed Hitler.
[00:12:17.514 --> 00:12:18.515]  He was a Rothschild.
[00:12:19.192 --> 00:12:21.113]  Of course, they're about as Jewish as I am, I guess.
[00:12:21.153 --> 00:12:22.674]  They're not really Jewish, folks.
[00:12:23.094 --> 00:12:25.996]  About as Jewish as some black person walking down the street.
[00:12:26.376 --> 00:12:28.998]  But the point is that they were behind this.
[00:12:29.058 --> 00:12:30.619]  So was the British royal family.
[00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:37.482]  The prince couldn't become king because he stayed in Nazi Germany until, what, 1942, then fled to Franco-Spain.
[00:12:38.223 --> 00:12:39.364]  He was pro-Nazi.
[00:12:40.004 --> 00:12:44.286]  I mean, Mr. Kennedy, Joseph Kennedy, was the British ambassador.
[00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:45.167]  He was pro-Hitler.
[00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:55.434]  Again, they energized Hitler, they financed Hitler, they supported Hitler, and they set him up to carry out their aims for world government to create the crisis.
[00:12:56.555 --> 00:12:59.978]  Just like Saddam Hussein was a CIA asset by 1958.
[00:13:00.198 --> 00:13:01.900]  That's admitted, folks.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.021]  That's the National Archives.
[00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:11.029]  Although it has long been known that Henry Ford, the company's founder, held anti-Semitic views, the extent of his involvement in Hitler's rise to power is in dispute.
[00:13:11.701 --> 00:13:13.221]  We're good to go.
[00:13:37.866 --> 00:13:46.111]  And Bush Sr., Prescott, was taken into custody, paid a fine, and the record was a sponge, but I have the mainstream articles from 1942 where that happened.
[00:13:46.551 --> 00:13:56.578]  Before America entered the war, Ford supplied Germany with military equipment while declining to make engines for the RAF, calling into question Ford's claims to have been strictly neutral, says Mr. Wallace.
[00:13:56.978 --> 00:14:00.520]  Ford argues that it had no control over the use of slave labor in its German plant.
[00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:03.136]  As it lost control of the company after 1941.
[00:14:03.476 --> 00:14:08.658]  The documents cited in the book say the first forced laborers arrived in the factory before America entered the war.
[00:14:09.219 --> 00:14:16.522]  Intelligence documents also suggest that Henry Ford's secretary, Ernest Leibold, was a Nazi spy who helped develop his boss's paranoia about Jews.
[00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:25.306]  Henry Ford is mentioned in Mein Kampf and was hailed by Hitler, who kept a portrait of the industrialist above his desk as my inspiration.
[00:14:25.908 --> 00:14:34.277]  You also, at the Wolf's Lair and at the little High Mountain Club they had, two separate areas, had a photo of Margaret Sanger.
[00:14:34.297 --> 00:14:40.944]  And you will never hear the ADL or Simon Wiesenthal Center or any of them talk bad about this.
[00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:41.665]  You'll never hear...
[00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:49.906]  Jesse Jackson talked about Albert Pike's statue behind the Supreme Court building in D.C., the founder of the Klan.
[00:14:51.527 --> 00:14:52.488]  Just incredible.
[00:14:52.588 --> 00:14:55.510]  So if you're a real Nazi, folks, you're going to be just fine.
[00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:03.916]  If you say you love Hitler and want to be worshipped and have people follow all your orders and be worshipped at Nuremberg and want to be a dictator, you become California governor.
[00:15:04.594 --> 00:15:05.135]  We're good to go.
[00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:41.966]  Again, if you're involved in killing millions of Jews, and you call yourself Jewish and have blonde hair and blue eyes, you will be worshipped properly.
[00:15:42.426 --> 00:15:44.467]  Just thought we'd go over that for you.
[00:15:45.108 --> 00:15:47.749]  You see, the reality is the reverse of what you've been told.
[00:15:47.769 --> 00:15:54.234]  The New World Order is masters of infiltrating organizations, infiltrating groups, and controlling them.
[00:15:54.934 --> 00:15:57.676]  And that's what we face today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:59.241 --> 00:15:59.822]  It goes on.
[00:16:00.002 --> 00:16:06.927]  In 1938, Ford was awarded the General Grand Cross of the German Eagle, the highest Nazi honor that could be given to a non-German.
[00:16:07.428 --> 00:16:27.424]  Simon Reich, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, who was employed by Ford to investigate the activities of the company's German arm under the Nazis, turned the page so that Mr. Wallace, he is reminding a new generation of who Henry Ford was and what he did, but some of the most provocative claims in the book lack serious substantiation.
[00:16:27.444 --> 00:16:27.784]  Yeah, right.
[00:16:28.547 --> 00:16:29.408]  It's a whitewash.
[00:16:29.428 --> 00:16:32.389]  It wasn't just Henry Ford.
[00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:33.990]  It was IBM.
[00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:39.133]  It was General Motors, General Electric, General Steel, on and on.
[00:16:39.153 --> 00:16:41.715]  If you've got the word general before it, that's a bunch of generals.
[00:16:42.095 --> 00:16:44.876]  But that's just the facts, folks.
[00:16:44.896 --> 00:16:47.198]  I remember sitting around the deer camp.
[00:16:47.638 --> 00:16:48.859]  All these guys are dead now.
[00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:52.361]  Talking to B-17 pilots, people we've had guests on.
[00:16:52.381 --> 00:16:53.281]  It's been in a bunch of books.
[00:16:53.301 --> 00:16:54.302]  It's even been on the History Channel.
[00:16:54.949 --> 00:17:06.616]  But I've talked to people face-to-face who were in those aircraft, in those prop-driven bombers, and they would be told whole areas were off limits.
[00:17:07.557 --> 00:17:08.458]  And the Germans knew it.
[00:17:08.498 --> 00:17:11.179]  They wouldn't even put up flight protection for vast areas.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.741]  And there were certain targets that our people were allowed to go after.
[00:17:15.842 --> 00:17:16.803]  And it's horrible.
[00:17:17.883 --> 00:17:23.287]  But again, if you're against Hitler, you're basically anti-Semitic, according to some of these groups now.
[00:17:24.515 --> 00:17:27.837]  So that's very interesting how they've twisted everything.
[00:17:28.157 --> 00:17:31.018]  And the Nazi movement in this country is controlled by the federal government.
[00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:33.019]  It's just a fact, folks.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:42.604]  And just like the Black Panther, the new Black Panther Party is, and Khalid Mohammed, funded by the Ford Foundation, Machel Araza, these radical Palestinian groups.
[00:17:42.624 --> 00:17:48.567]  Got a big article today about a bunch of congressmen sending letters to the Ford Foundation saying, please stop funding the Palestinians.
[00:17:49.607 --> 00:17:51.648]  And people say, oh, Henry Ford lost control of it.
[00:17:51.688 --> 00:17:52.109]  No, he didn't.
[00:17:52.149 --> 00:17:52.849]  It's the same thing.
[00:17:54.924 --> 00:17:57.486]  It's more complex than you were first told.
[00:17:57.526 --> 00:18:00.187]  So you can comment on that if you'd like at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:00.467]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:09.275 --> 00:18:33.261]  And I hope that the Jewish Americans out there will boycott the ADL and the Simon Wiesenthal Center and other, because the Simon Wiesenthal Center will list Second Amendment groups, Steve Voss, your recording artist, anybody who's never said a word about black people or white people or Jews or Eskimos or anybody else, they'll list you as a hate group and then endorse Arnold Schwarzenegger, as Simon Wiesenthal Center did.
[00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:35.281]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:18:36.099 --> 00:18:44.224]  You know, as a person who's, I guess you'd call Anglo-Saxon, I find it very irritating, and I don't know how people who are Jewish out there can put up with this.
[00:18:45.384 --> 00:18:50.787]  It just makes my head spin sometimes how scrambled the definitions are out there.
[00:18:51.288 --> 00:18:59.232]  By the way, I saw my great-uncle, Uncle Leonard, my grandfather's brother this weekend, because my grandmother died.
[00:18:59.252 --> 00:19:02.474]  I was out in East Texas there dealing with that.
[00:19:03.246 --> 00:19:04.667]  And he doesn't listen to my radio show.
[00:19:04.687 --> 00:19:05.527]  I'm not on in Houston.
[00:19:05.867 --> 00:19:10.008]  He got out of his car and walked over and he said, George Bush is the biggest liberal I've ever seen.
[00:19:10.389 --> 00:19:11.629]  The government's growing inside.
[00:19:11.709 --> 00:19:13.790]  Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh are a bunch of liars.
[00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.730]  I'm not listening to them anymore.
[00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:20.172]  Sean Hannity endorsed Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's more liberal than Clinton.
[00:19:21.132 --> 00:19:22.053]  And I said amen to that.
[00:19:22.073 --> 00:19:25.454]  And then I saw my cousin, who's the special forces officer.
[00:19:26.218 --> 00:19:28.039]  And now based right here in Austin.
[00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:32.102]  And he was telling me, yeah, we're getting our microchips soon.
[00:19:32.142 --> 00:19:34.143]  We're all having discussions about the New World Order.
[00:19:34.864 --> 00:19:36.525]  This is family that wouldn't listen to me.
[00:19:36.605 --> 00:19:38.767]  They're real conservative anti-communist types.
[00:19:39.687 --> 00:19:40.167]  Wouldn't listen.
[00:19:40.188 --> 00:19:41.508]  It's only part of the paradigm.
[00:19:42.609 --> 00:19:43.590]  They all get it now.
[00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:47.412]  It was all New World Order this, New World Order that.
[00:19:47.432 --> 00:19:49.494]  And we're getting reports of this everywhere.
[00:19:49.534 --> 00:19:54.177]  People in grocery stores and shopping malls hearing conversation about New World Order.
[00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:56.723]  People walk by cops and they're talking about it.
[00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:58.906]  A massive awakening taking place.
[00:19:58.926 --> 00:20:02.411]  Hey, what do you think is going to happen in Iraq in the next six months, next two years?
[00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:03.753]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:03.853 --> 00:20:08.298]  We'll cover some of that news, get to John and others that are patiently holding.
[00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:09.280]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:10.703 --> 00:20:14.606]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:20:14.826 --> 00:20:27.095]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:20:27.535 --> 00:20:27.935]  The U.S.
[00:20:27.975 --> 00:20:33.559]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:20:33.959 --> 00:20:36.161]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:20:38.027 --> 00:20:38.487]  We're good to go.
[00:21:05.942 --> 00:21:08.605]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:10.467 --> 00:21:21.197]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:21:21.377 --> 00:21:28.945]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:29.165 --> 00:21:30.466]  The system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.041]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:21:49.081 --> 00:21:50.982]  The water level is always visible.
[00:21:51.162 --> 00:21:57.084]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:21:57.344 --> 00:22:01.046]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:22:11.775 --> 00:22:17.705]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:22:17.925 --> 00:22:20.149]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:22:25.737 --> 00:22:26.337]  We're good to go.
[00:22:42.608 --> 00:22:42.968]  We're good to go.
[00:23:09.261 --> 00:23:11.763]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[00:23:11.843 --> 00:23:12.323]  Pollution.
[00:23:12.363 --> 00:23:12.663]  Pollen.
[00:23:12.703 --> 00:23:13.824]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:23:13.864 --> 00:23:14.284]  Allergies.
[00:23:14.424 --> 00:23:14.704]  Asthma.
[00:23:14.744 --> 00:23:15.325]  Probably not.
[00:23:15.425 --> 00:23:16.185]  Well, listen to this.
[00:23:16.425 --> 00:23:25.391]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:26.291]  Six to ten times?
[00:23:26.311 --> 00:23:27.392]  How could that be, you ask?
[00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:27.712]  Worse.
[00:23:27.832 --> 00:23:29.153]  Think about what's inside your home.
[00:23:29.313 --> 00:23:29.974]  Hairspray.
[00:23:30.094 --> 00:23:30.594]  Chemicals.
[00:23:30.794 --> 00:23:31.655]  Does anyone smoke?
[00:23:31.695 --> 00:23:31.855]  Fumes.
[00:23:31.995 --> 00:23:33.696]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:23:34.136 --> 00:23:35.737]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:23:35.757 --> 00:23:36.497]  Toxic fumes.
[00:23:36.517 --> 00:23:37.358]  Well, I'll tell you where they
[00:23:37.938 --> 00:23:38.499]  You're so funny.
[00:24:08.399 --> 00:24:12.403]  We're good to go.
[00:24:12.443 --> 00:24:20.090]  We're good to go.
[00:24:33.692 --> 00:24:34.852]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:34.892 --> 00:24:39.373]  In fact, I'm going to go to your calls here in just about a minute and a half.
[00:24:40.494 --> 00:24:44.775]  Coming up, we're going to talk about the real casualties of U.S.
[00:24:44.835 --> 00:24:48.596]  troops, amputees returning to duties, an AP headline.
[00:24:50.176 --> 00:24:54.917]  Sixteen of our troops died in the helicopter RPG attack yesterday.
[00:24:54.957 --> 00:24:56.298]  A total number of 18 U.S.
[00:24:56.338 --> 00:24:57.758]  troops dying in separate attacks.
[00:24:59.156 --> 00:25:11.402]  So two dying in separate attacks, under 16, that's 18 dead, and now they're saying 26 wounded, 20 wounded in a helicopter who didn't die, by the grace of God, and six others that were wounded.
[00:25:11.482 --> 00:25:13.123]  I mean, this list just keeps growing.
[00:25:13.924 --> 00:25:15.124]  We'll be covering that.
[00:25:15.204 --> 00:25:22.548]  They're beating up journalists, killing journalists, running over Iraqi children, bulldozing their farms, creating more and more hatred.
[00:25:23.548 --> 00:25:25.209]  And believe me, the Pentagon's not stupid.
[00:25:26.309 --> 00:25:31.492]  They know this will make them hate us, and then they can send the UN in as the savior later.
[00:25:31.512 --> 00:25:32.872]  This is a very old tactic.
[00:25:32.892 --> 00:25:33.593]  We'll go into it.
[00:25:33.873 --> 00:25:34.953]  The Romans would do this.
[00:25:34.993 --> 00:25:38.035]  They'd send a governor in to squeeze people, to abuse them.
[00:25:38.955 --> 00:25:40.816]  Then they would send in, quote, a savior.
[00:25:40.856 --> 00:25:44.178]  They would publicly reprimand the governor, call him back to Rome.
[00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:48.540]  This is thousands of years old, folks, and we keep buying it.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.541]  Iraqi child crushed by U.S.
[00:25:50.601 --> 00:25:50.901]  tank.
[00:25:51.952 --> 00:25:53.877]  Public confidence in Bush continues to plunge.
[00:25:54.278 --> 00:25:56.383]  His approval rating has now hit 40%.
[00:25:56.563 --> 00:25:57.425]  Look out, folks.
[00:25:58.267 --> 00:26:01.374]  They're now saying a member of Parliament in England that will be there for 10 years.
[00:26:02.889 --> 00:26:06.110]  Also, record anti-war marches with very diverse crowds.
[00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:10.051]  A lot of conservatives involved there, which just outrages the globalists.
[00:26:10.072 --> 00:26:11.712]  They don't care if it's left-wing or right-wing.
[00:26:11.972 --> 00:26:14.133]  They don't like the two groups getting together for freedom.
[00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:18.394]  We'll also get into the real numbers of dead U.S.
[00:26:18.434 --> 00:26:18.794]  troops.
[00:26:18.894 --> 00:26:21.475]  New military mortuary is now opened up.
[00:26:21.915 --> 00:26:23.816]  Pentagon keeps dead out of sight.
[00:26:23.896 --> 00:26:26.537]  Bush team doesn't want people to see human cost of war.
[00:26:26.697 --> 00:26:29.558]  Even body bags are now sanitized as transfer tubes.
[00:26:30.018 --> 00:26:30.498]  Good day, sir.
[00:26:30.578 --> 00:26:33.579]  I wanted to essentially call in and talk about Iraq.
[00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:35.940]  They're lying about the casualties.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:36.920]  That's number one.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.601]  Number two, the invasion was flawed.
[00:26:38.641 --> 00:26:39.061]  The strategic
[00:27:00.034 --> 00:27:01.535]  The plan was totally flawed.
[00:27:02.255 --> 00:27:19.082]  Basically, I was watching CNN on Sunday morning, and you could have juxtaposed SecDef McNamara with that Skeletor-looking creature, Rumsfeld, and saying that somehow the Iraqis need us and we're not going to abandon them.
[00:27:19.122 --> 00:27:21.183]  We're going to do exactly what we did in Vietnam.
[00:27:21.643 --> 00:27:22.884]  We're going to kill a bunch of men.
[00:27:23.624 --> 00:27:26.825]  We're going to infuse the extremist Islamists
[00:27:28.769 --> 00:27:31.613]  And when we leave, they're going to blow other things up.
[00:27:32.194 --> 00:27:38.122]  And when you're talking about these bold numbers, I can about guarantee there's going to be a massive terror attack any time.
[00:27:39.284 --> 00:27:40.204]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:27:40.244 --> 00:27:42.446]  We've said if it dropped before 40, look out.
[00:27:43.506 --> 00:27:49.689]  And we saw Clinton blow up Oklahoma City when he hit 32, 33, and then a year later on Air Force One.
[00:27:50.049 --> 00:28:00.394]  Tell USA Today and CNN reporters that I owe the revival of my presidency and my re-election of 96, quote, to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:28:00.434 --> 00:28:03.896]  But what you said previous to that is absolutely on target.
[00:28:05.064 --> 00:28:10.988]  The papers have come out now in Vietnam that it was meant to be a big cash cow for weapons sales.
[00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:13.370]  They wanted to drag it out as long as possible.
[00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:29.581]  They wanted to create a counter-revolutionary or revolutionary, I should say, leftist movement, communist movement in America, because being against the war was good, but the communists could do it for all the wrong reasons, build up a socialist, leftist movement in this country.
[00:28:30.528 --> 00:28:35.012]  Then at the same time, the UN can then come in as the savior in Iraq.
[00:28:35.312 --> 00:28:39.355]  The globalists aren't stupid, and that's exactly what they're doing here.
[00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:47.320]  So they get the oil, they get the weapons sales, they get to get a base there in the Middle East to strike out at Syria and Iran, and they get to kill a lot of U.S.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:53.185]  troops, which they hate from their own papers as they slash their funding and health care and everything else.
[00:28:53.685 --> 00:28:54.606]  This is the point.
[00:28:54.646 --> 00:28:55.726]  I was in the Marine Corps.
[00:28:56.267 --> 00:28:59.209]  If you are an amputee, you have to be discharged.
[00:29:00.069 --> 00:29:05.072]  I mean, if you have new arm or new leg, I mean, how are you going to function?
[00:29:05.793 --> 00:29:06.694]  I mean, in combat, you can't.
[00:29:06.714 --> 00:29:12.638]  Well, they are actually pressuring people, not just that they want to stay in, but pressuring them to stay in.
[00:29:13.938 --> 00:29:19.422]  Amputees now and thousands of troops and dozens of bases are not being given health care.
[00:29:19.762 --> 00:29:21.884]  We're talking about people with bullet wounds, folks.
[00:29:22.304 --> 00:29:23.685]  Just one more thing, sir, and I'll get off.
[00:29:24.405 --> 00:29:28.028]  This situation in Iraq, it's going to continue to get worse.
[00:29:28.627 --> 00:29:30.728]  I think there's going to be a massive uprising.
[00:29:31.249 --> 00:29:34.231]  And, sir, even just with the bodies, how many people they've got over there?
[00:29:34.251 --> 00:29:34.231]  150,000?
[00:29:34.271 --> 00:29:44.818]  And if that's probably only 20,000 or 30,000 are actually trained infantry, they cannot confiscate all the weapons just by the law of large numbers.
[00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:50.182]  So there must be massive weapon caches, and the borders over there are open.
[00:29:50.662 --> 00:29:51.482]  Individuals are fighting.
[00:29:51.502 --> 00:29:57.606]  Well, you could own a gun in Iraq, and Iraq is a giant armed camp, and the more kids they run over with bulldozers, the more resistance.
[00:29:57.626 --> 00:29:58.207]  Thanks for the call.
[00:30:00.663 --> 00:30:01.544]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.045 --> 00:30:03.647]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:15.733]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:16.694]  Yes, it's true.

[00:33:27.762 --> 00:33:33.506]  And then I'm going to get back into the details of what's really happening over in Iraq.
[00:33:33.526 --> 00:33:37.549]  I've got about 20 articles here I just want to run through as quickly as possible.
[00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:44.033]  But before I go back to your calls, I want to remind the listeners, or for those that don't know, I want to tell you, I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[00:33:44.093 --> 00:33:45.174]  I've made 10 films.
[00:33:46.275 --> 00:33:49.197]  The films that I've put together have even aired on national television.
[00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:57.532]  I like the footage I shot that was used in World of Wonders production that's aired from Japan to England to the United States on the Trio Network nationally.
[00:33:57.552 --> 00:34:00.973]  It's aired about, I guess, 20 times or so during prime time.
[00:34:02.733 --> 00:34:04.193]  This is powerful stuff, folks.
[00:34:04.593 --> 00:34:06.214]  This is hardcore information.
[00:34:06.894 --> 00:34:15.116]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove and caught world leaders engaging in a very serious Babylon mystery religion satanic ritual.
[00:34:16.559 --> 00:34:27.943]  And the story of that and the footage of what happened in the first ever video, the only video, only images from inside there, one other photograph out of there, have now been shown worldwide.
[00:34:28.023 --> 00:34:33.905]  But my documentary, the long version, the director's cut, World of Wonderpiece was 60 minutes long.
[00:34:34.706 --> 00:34:37.187]  Mine is two hours and five minutes.
[00:34:37.267 --> 00:34:40.228]  It's Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:34:40.288 --> 00:34:41.148]  You might want to get it.
[00:34:42.359 --> 00:34:44.360]  I've got Road to Tyranny.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.780]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.521]  Frankly, one of my better films.
[00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:48.301]  They're all excellent.
[00:34:48.861 --> 00:34:53.282]  Covering the history of governments blowing stuff up to blame it on their enemies and to get control.
[00:34:54.403 --> 00:34:55.543]  The Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:34:55.583 --> 00:34:57.024]  The first World Trade Center attack.
[00:34:57.464 --> 00:34:59.424]  The second World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001.
[00:35:01.045 --> 00:35:02.205]  Where the globalists are going.
[00:35:02.245 --> 00:35:03.145]  Their police state.
[00:35:03.866 --> 00:35:05.226]  I mean, you talk about an education.
[00:35:05.246 --> 00:35:06.166]  This video will do it.
[00:35:06.206 --> 00:35:08.187]  Two and a half plus hours long.
[00:35:08.207 --> 00:35:09.828]  170 minutes on DVD, even longer.
[00:35:12.473 --> 00:35:14.313]  I mean, these films cover multiple subjects.
[00:35:14.413 --> 00:35:25.615]  One of my newest films is Police State 3 Total Enslavement, an amazing video covered in PNAC, what the New World Order is, government-run white slavery rings, gun control, concentration camps.
[00:35:26.256 --> 00:35:30.216]  We've got Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security being analyzed, Ashcroft's lies.
[00:35:30.596 --> 00:35:33.777]  That's two hours and 44 minutes long.
[00:35:34.657 --> 00:35:36.097]  That video, it's excellent.
[00:35:36.257 --> 00:35:38.158]  Really, it's three or four videos in one for $25.95.
[00:35:40.714 --> 00:35:42.155]  You want to be an expert on the New World Order?
[00:35:42.175 --> 00:35:43.276]  You want to know how to educate others?
[00:35:43.296 --> 00:35:47.138]  You want to have tools that will wake your friends and family and neighbors and community leaders up?
[00:35:47.678 --> 00:35:48.399]  This will do it.
[00:35:48.939 --> 00:35:54.903]  My newest video has just been out for a week, and it is The Matrix of Evil.
[00:35:55.683 --> 00:35:57.305]  The Matrix of Evil.
[00:35:58.205 --> 00:36:02.448]  And it is about two hours and ten minutes long.
[00:36:02.468 --> 00:36:03.168]  It's $25.95.
[00:36:03.248 --> 00:36:04.209]  It has Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, myself,
[00:36:08.357 --> 00:36:17.526]  Colonel Craig Roberts, it's got Frank Morales all talking about the New World Order, the end of posse commentatus, government-sponsored terror, Cynthia McKinney gets into the U.N.
[00:36:17.546 --> 00:36:23.873]  kidnapping rings, Austin throwing out the Patriot Act, some snippets of three of my best speeches I've given in the last few months.
[00:36:23.893 --> 00:36:28.337]  It's an amazing new video, really powerful for folks that are now getting it and seeing it.
[00:36:28.858 --> 00:36:30.099]  You need to have it.
[00:36:30.706 --> 00:36:31.747]  The Matrix of Evil.
[00:36:53.699 --> 00:37:01.265]  Kill many birds with one stone, get great videos that are riveting that will wake yourself up and others, and support the show at the same time.
[00:37:02.429 --> 00:37:05.571]  Poll-free number to order the videos or the books or the T-shirts or any of it.

[00:37:35.706 --> 00:37:48.892]  And I'm Alex Jones at 3,001, that's 3,001, South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:37:49.232 --> 00:37:49.672]  Don't wait.
[00:37:49.752 --> 00:37:50.413]  Take action.
[00:37:50.793 --> 00:37:52.413]  We're having a massive effect.
[00:37:52.613 --> 00:37:53.694]  Again, we're at the tipping point.
[00:37:53.954 --> 00:37:56.855]  We've got to push this over the edge in this fight with the globalists.
[00:37:57.316 --> 00:37:58.216]  Let's go back to the calls.
[00:37:58.256 --> 00:38:00.777]  Christine in Kansas, thanks for holding.
[00:38:00.797 --> 00:38:01.437]  You're on the air.
[00:38:01.457 --> 00:38:02.518]  Greetings, Alex.
[00:38:03.243 --> 00:38:03.623]  Welcome.
[00:38:03.784 --> 00:38:04.504]  I'm from Kansas City.
[00:38:04.705 --> 00:38:23.443]  I want to tell you that I'm not sure what's going on in Iraq, but I do know this, that you have taught me to hold the feet to the fire of our local public officials, and I do know what's going on at the local public library, the post office, the state treasurer, and the grocery store, and those feet I'm holding in the fire.
[00:38:23.684 --> 00:38:24.865]  I'm putting them right in the fire.
[00:38:25.533 --> 00:38:34.835]  You know, when I go to the grocery store and I talk to the people around me, and when the checkout person asks for my card, I tell them why I'm not going to give them my card.
[00:38:34.875 --> 00:38:37.956]  They look at me cross-eyed like I'm from Mars, you know.
[00:38:38.976 --> 00:38:45.257]  When I go to the post office, and the girl at the post office mistakenly asked me the wrong question.
[00:38:45.297 --> 00:38:48.958]  She said to me when I walked up there, what is in your package, right?
[00:38:49.538 --> 00:38:55.159]  They're supposed to ask, is there any liquid hydrogen, oxygen, or whatever they ask in your package, right?
[00:38:55.874 --> 00:38:59.237]  And instead of asking me that, she said, what is in your package, right?
[00:38:59.877 --> 00:39:02.899]  I said to her, it's none of your business what's in my package.
[00:39:04.219 --> 00:39:13.704]  Well, for those that don't know, the grocery stores are putting in the thumb scanners, putting in the self-checkout lines, which they're then going to phase out the service lines.
[00:39:13.724 --> 00:39:24.749]  This is from the Global of Stone documents, their own RFID and biometric consortium meetings that the big grocery store owners and Walmart and Home Depot and the rest of them meeting are setting up.
[00:39:24.809 --> 00:39:25.750]  We've got to boycott them.
[00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:28.491]  We've got to tell them, we're not going to use your self-checkout lines.
[00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:29.912]  We're not going to use your biometrics.
[00:39:30.372 --> 00:39:31.913]  And these discount cards...
[00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:33.370]  We're good to go.
[00:39:49.195 --> 00:39:59.200]  And hundreds of different grocery store chains are doing this around the country, and it's horrible, and they are training us to be part of this cashless society.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:39:59.620]  Go ahead.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:00.220]  Right.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.140]  We're not going to take it.
[00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:04.702]  I just want the people to know, in case they're wondering, Alex loves you.
[00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:09.264]  He absolutely loves you, and he's telling you the truth, and he's been telling us the truth.
[00:40:09.304 --> 00:40:13.526]  I've been listening for over four years, and I want to say, Alex, I'm very sorry about your grandmother.
[00:40:14.792 --> 00:40:23.266]  I want also the people to know, and I want to encourage you, Alex, that you blessed us so much by coming to Kansas City and talking to us and meeting with us.
[00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:29.953]  You know, you're teaching us, right, that there is a war on for our mind.
[00:40:30.393 --> 00:40:34.295]  Well, I would say I'm just trying to get you to take the blinders off.
[00:40:34.595 --> 00:40:35.116]  That's right.
[00:40:35.236 --> 00:40:37.657]  And then together, you can see a lot more than I can.
[00:40:37.697 --> 00:40:39.678]  You're a lot more intelligent than I am.
[00:40:39.738 --> 00:40:44.421]  Together, our brain power is just absolutely massive.
[00:40:45.081 --> 00:40:47.525]  And, no, the listeners helped me keep track of everything.
[00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:48.926]  You're just absolutely wonderful.
[00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:50.468]  You go to more cities.
[00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:53.172]  More cities need to have you as a guest.
[00:40:53.392 --> 00:40:55.034]  That's what I'm saying to you, okay?
[00:40:55.074 --> 00:40:55.695]  We love you.
[00:40:55.975 --> 00:41:01.021]  And I want the listeners to know this in case they're wondering, because I know that some of them are wondering, okay?
[00:41:01.522 --> 00:41:03.845]  Alex loves you, and he loves America.
[00:41:04.355 --> 00:41:05.377]  And he's helping us.
[00:41:05.557 --> 00:41:06.438]  That's what he's doing.
[00:41:06.498 --> 00:41:09.483]  He's informing us, and he's showing us the absolute truth.
[00:41:09.683 --> 00:41:11.205]  Okay, Alex, have a great day.
[00:41:11.506 --> 00:41:12.086]  Well, thank you.
[00:41:12.407 --> 00:41:12.948]  I'll say this.
[00:41:13.669 --> 00:41:16.032]  The mainstream media tries to lie and manipulate.
[00:41:16.333 --> 00:41:17.454]  We try to tell the truth.
[00:41:17.494 --> 00:41:18.656]  We try to study history.
[00:41:18.956 --> 00:41:20.499]  We try to do the best job we can.
[00:41:21.159 --> 00:41:27.862]  And I wouldn't say I've got absolute truth, only God's got that, but we do know the absolute truth about the New World Order being evil.
[00:41:28.303 --> 00:41:29.323]  That's like gravity.
[00:41:29.423 --> 00:41:37.347]  So on many subjects we do have the absolute truth, but on many others we're trying to get to the truth and find out how deep the rabbit hole really goes.
[00:41:37.867 --> 00:41:38.888]  But thank you, Christine.
[00:41:39.308 --> 00:41:49.773]  Yeah, I get invited to Rhode Island, Tennessee, Norfolk, Virginia, L.A., California, to speak to groups every day and
[00:41:52.071 --> 00:41:53.712]  Again, I don't want people to think I'm snubbing them.
[00:41:53.732 --> 00:42:00.514]  It's hard for me to travel because I'm so busy here doing a radio show, making films, doing TV shows, doing radio interviews every day.
[00:42:01.195 --> 00:42:02.435]  And I've counted the cost.
[00:42:02.515 --> 00:42:03.195]  I've looked at it.
[00:42:03.315 --> 00:42:10.718]  I can reach more people doing radio interviews than I can traveling around the country and giving speeches, though I probably will do that more in the future.
[00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:17.701]  But what we need to know is that all of you are leaders in your areas.
[00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:24.756]  And what we need to have listeners do is get their own talk shows in their own area.
[00:42:25.076 --> 00:42:27.619]  Or to get my films in Aramon Access Television.
[00:42:27.939 --> 00:42:33.244]  Or to get other great films in Aramon Public Access where you can reach tens of thousands of people in your town or city.
[00:42:33.805 --> 00:42:36.948]  And there's a lot of different ways to effect change and get the job done.
[00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:39.191]  But putting out the question again...
[00:42:41.234 --> 00:42:48.639]  18 troops died, 16 of them in the missile attack, the RPG, rocket propelled grenade attack on that Chinook yesterday.
[00:42:48.659 --> 00:42:52.842]  Another two troops were killed in ambushes, over 26 injured.
[00:42:53.322 --> 00:42:54.503]  Those numbers are growing.
[00:42:55.643 --> 00:42:56.884]  Where do you see this going?
[00:42:57.004 --> 00:42:58.265]  What's the exit strategy?
[00:42:58.425 --> 00:42:59.806]  What do you see developing in Iraq?
[00:42:59.866 --> 00:43:00.386]  I'll tell you.
[00:43:01.127 --> 00:43:03.388]  We're going to stay there as a unit under the UN.
[00:43:03.408 --> 00:43:04.749]  They're going to come in as the good cop.
[00:43:05.479 --> 00:43:07.640]  And America's going to be demonized worldwide.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.722]  All the big banks that own America and Europe are going to get all that oil and all the weapons sale money.
[00:43:13.682 --> 00:43:17.684]  Let's go ahead and talk now to Ron in Nevada.
[00:43:17.764 --> 00:43:18.644]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:43:18.704 --> 00:43:19.045]  Welcome.
[00:43:20.205 --> 00:43:21.185]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[00:43:21.285 --> 00:43:21.586]  Good.
[00:43:21.606 --> 00:43:26.367]  Do you still have your night show on, your night program?
[00:43:26.708 --> 00:43:28.188]  Yes, 9 to midnight central.
[00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:34.891]  Yeah, because I was getting you on 5.0, and almost the last two weeks I haven't gotten you.
[00:43:35.416 --> 00:43:40.138]  Well, you know, there's been a lot of different sunspot activity and different frequencies are better different times of the year.
[00:43:40.418 --> 00:43:42.479]  Have you tried 6890 on shortwave?
[00:43:43.779 --> 00:43:45.040]  Yeah, let me write that down.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.880]  I'll try it again tonight, see if I can get it.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.301]  Well, let me just tell folks shortwave frequencies that listen that way.
[00:43:49.681 --> 00:43:50.582]  During the day, 11 to 2 Central.
[00:43:52.014 --> 00:43:54.897]  No, that's 12 to 3 Eastern, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:43:54.937 --> 00:43:55.257]  Eastern.
[00:43:55.657 --> 00:43:58.940]  It's 12.172 and 93.20, two separate frequencies, and at night it's 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:43:59.380]  68.90, okay.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.503]  Yeah, and that's more of a long-range frequency for the West Coast.
[00:44:13.516 --> 00:44:15.437]  Yeah, that's why I'm listening to you, Nevada.
[00:44:15.557 --> 00:44:19.678]  I was getting you on 5-0, but it's a little small or portable.
[00:44:20.378 --> 00:44:24.640]  The reason I called, I wanted to ask you about this Wesley Clark.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.741]  They did an interview on him.
[00:44:27.521 --> 00:44:29.442]  Katie Couric did an interview.
[00:44:30.062 --> 00:44:35.404]  And they claim that he's supposed to go back into opening up like if Bush.
[00:44:35.824 --> 00:44:39.325]  And then I think they equated Clinton to the 9-1-1.
[00:44:42.317 --> 00:44:51.262]  And later on in the program, they had Tim Russett come on, and Tim Russett used the term 9-1-1.
[00:44:51.462 --> 00:44:56.985]  And they used it as a warning that anybody that tries to reopen that.
[00:44:57.005 --> 00:45:01.027]  I'm not clear on exactly what you're saying.
[00:45:01.047 --> 00:45:03.768]  Anyone that tries to reopen that 9-1-1, what are you saying?
[00:45:04.341 --> 00:45:06.702]  Well, first of all, they used the term 9-1-1.
[00:45:07.343 --> 00:45:11.165]  They didn't say 9-11, which they almost always use.
[00:45:11.625 --> 00:45:14.787]  So when they said 9-1-1, I was thinking of your tape right away.
[00:45:14.847 --> 00:45:16.688]  I have that tape, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:45:17.788 --> 00:45:24.132]  But they're trying to say that Clark, Leslie Clark, is trying to find that Bush is responsible.
[00:45:24.592 --> 00:45:29.054]  And then they were trying to say that if Clinton is responsible, but they used the term 9-1-1.
[00:45:31.529 --> 00:45:35.291]  And I didn't know if you heard about that, and I thought that was unusual.
[00:45:37.272 --> 00:45:42.595]  They were claiming it's taboo for anybody to equate that, I guess, to either president.
[00:45:43.555 --> 00:45:49.939]  Well, there must have been an order that went out last week, because all over talk radio, all over Canadian TV, all over U.S.
[00:45:49.959 --> 00:45:50.559]  television,
[00:45:51.807 --> 00:45:58.209]  They've been out there saying that, oh, how dare these people say the government could have been behind 9-11.
[00:45:58.269 --> 00:45:59.869]  How dare anyone say that?
[00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:04.790]  And then to try to make it partisan, they go, the Democrats go, yeah, Bush knew.
[00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:10.511]  And then Bush goes, no, Clinton knew and wouldn't let the Sudanese or the Afghans arrest bin Laden.
[00:46:10.932 --> 00:46:12.792]  That shows how it's unified.
[00:46:12.852 --> 00:46:15.493]  Yes, Bill Clinton protected bin Laden.
[00:46:16.093 --> 00:46:16.753]  Bill Laden.
[00:46:18.855 --> 00:46:21.599]  Yes, Bush protected bin Laden.
[00:46:21.639 --> 00:46:23.121]  He works for the CIA.
[00:46:23.441 --> 00:46:25.904]  This is a long-term operation.
[00:46:25.944 --> 00:46:26.946]  So they're all guilty.
[00:46:26.986 --> 00:46:28.067]  They're all just puppets.
[00:46:28.107 --> 00:46:28.688]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:29.289 --> 00:46:30.969]  Good to hear from you, Ron.
[00:46:31.409 --> 00:46:31.810]  Thank you.
[00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:32.470]  I appreciate it.
[00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:35.030]  So, I mean, it's the whole government, folks.
[00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:38.231]  That's why you've got to get the books, got to get the videos, to know the truth.
[00:46:38.731 --> 00:46:39.771]  It's not just rumors.
[00:46:39.951 --> 00:46:40.891]  It is a fact.
[00:46:41.271 --> 00:46:48.693]  When you stack all the evidence up, that the globalists just didn't have prior knowledge, but that they financed, protected, ran the entire attacks.
[00:46:49.553 --> 00:46:55.574]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Barney in Maryland.
[00:46:55.614 --> 00:46:56.515]  Barney, you're on the air.
[00:46:56.555 --> 00:46:56.975]  Go ahead.
[00:46:57.295 --> 00:46:57.995]  Yeah, how you doing?
[00:46:58.295 --> 00:46:58.535]  Fine.
[00:46:59.255 --> 00:47:13.224]  Hey, you know, it's really ridiculous for the United States to say they're going to stop terrorism when there's 73 million illegal aliens crossing the line, has crossed the line, and they can't do anything about that.
[00:47:14.252 --> 00:47:15.452]  Well, they can do something.
[00:47:15.472 --> 00:47:16.273]  They don't want to.
[00:47:16.313 --> 00:47:24.175]  They're taking thousands of Border Patrol off under orders and saying, you're fired if you don't become a Border... instead of a Border Patrol, an Air Marshal.
[00:47:24.976 --> 00:47:28.077]  And we basically don't have a southern border.
[00:47:28.777 --> 00:47:30.678]  And it's destroying our economy.
[00:47:30.698 --> 00:47:34.639]  And now we're finding out Walmart had illegals working for them at every level.
[00:47:35.679 --> 00:47:37.000]  Well, of course, we don't have any...
[00:47:37.913 --> 00:47:53.583]  Yeah, under the trade deals, they're merging our Social Security, merging our law enforcement, merging our military, right in front of everyone, with Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, all those countries.
[00:47:53.663 --> 00:47:59.766]  We're merging, and now under the free trade group of the Americas, we're going to merge with the Caribbean as well.
[00:47:59.786 --> 00:48:03.889]  Well, you know, Alex, all the Iraqis have to do...
[00:48:04.719 --> 00:48:15.067]  Is have about 100 men that melt in and out of Iraq planting contact, remote control, or delayed action bombs.
[00:48:15.888 --> 00:48:18.550]  And the United States would be running ragged trying to catch them.
[00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:23.614]  And then we would have to maintain at least 130,000 troops.
[00:48:23.654 --> 00:48:25.435]  Well, that's exactly what's happening right now.
[00:48:25.795 --> 00:48:28.818]  Yeah, and the Air Force and the Navy and the backup.
[00:48:28.878 --> 00:48:34.462]  And, you know, they say it's about eight or nine people required to back everybody up that's on the front line.
[00:48:35.197 --> 00:48:43.622]  And it won't be anything for the Iraqis to get all the recruits they want, because people all over the world want to attack the great Satan.
[00:48:44.723 --> 00:48:54.528]  And again, on the surface they think it's America, when in truth, Europe is controlling us, using us as their bad cop, like the new Soviet Union to carry this out.
[00:48:54.869 --> 00:48:58.731]  Domestically, we're giving propaganda about how good we are, but the same media...
[00:48:59.486 --> 00:49:02.928]  In Europe, it's all along by the same small group, is demonizing us.
[00:49:02.968 --> 00:49:09.373]  So that same media that's telling you the war is so good and we're so good, internationally is demonizing us.
[00:49:10.233 --> 00:49:11.934]  Very sophisticated propaganda.
[00:49:12.395 --> 00:49:24.022]  Well, you know, Alex, there's nothing stopping the Iraqis or the guerrillas from all over the world to start attacking our supply line and the United States itself.
[00:49:24.062 --> 00:49:26.064]  We're just opening ourselves up to the whole thing.
[00:49:26.104 --> 00:49:26.384]  Well, it's...
[00:49:26.824 --> 00:49:32.188]  It's already happening with the Arabs and Russia and China announcing that they're going to dump the dollar.
[00:49:33.188 --> 00:49:37.391]  The petro producers, the oil producers are saying they're not going to accept dollars.
[00:49:37.431 --> 00:49:38.592]  This has been in the news now.
[00:49:39.533 --> 00:49:50.920]  This is going to devastate our economy, and the economy is in shambles, and they've got articles about how our economy grew at 7-plus percent, and GDP, yeah, that's all the war expenditures, the hundreds of billions.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.382]  It has nothing to do with the real economy.
[00:49:53.422 --> 00:49:56.424]  The layoffs, the foreclosures are at record levels.
[00:49:57.084 --> 00:49:57.285]  Yep.
[00:49:57.945 --> 00:49:58.646]  Okay, I thank you.
[00:49:59.126 --> 00:49:59.867]  Hey, thank you, Barney.
[00:49:59.887 --> 00:50:08.214]  We'll come back and talk to Bob and others and get more into this news about the massive body bags, the cover-ups of the real levels of dead American soldiers.
[00:50:09.856 --> 00:50:13.659]  But a caller earlier, John in North Carolina...
[00:50:15.077 --> 00:50:22.764]  ...was bringing up about how they're going over there attacking the Iraqis, killing them, getting them to attack us, and causing resistance.
[00:50:23.184 --> 00:50:34.073]  That's what Rumsfeld said two years ago in his P2OG group he formed at the Pentagon, quote, to kill people and to make them attack us, so we, quote, have a pretext to attack them.
[00:50:34.213 --> 00:50:35.535]  It's an escalation.
[00:50:35.915 --> 00:50:37.196]  They don't care if troops die.
[00:50:37.696 --> 00:50:38.137]  They don't care.
[00:50:38.157 --> 00:50:41.680]  That just means more weapons sales, more of an excuse to put more troops in.
[00:50:42.569 --> 00:50:53.996]  More of an excuse to balkanize the country and get us all on different sides of the issue and to energize the left-wing movement in this country as the answer to the New World Order, when in truth it is the New World Order.
[00:50:54.636 --> 00:50:55.377]  You understand that?
[00:50:56.117 --> 00:51:01.940]  Just like Vietnam was used to do that, to drive your children into the arms of the beatniks or the communists.
[00:51:02.841 --> 00:51:03.802]  It's happening again.
[00:51:03.822 --> 00:51:07.744]  And when Wesley Clark is president, he's going to attack countries and the Democrats won't care.
[00:51:10.899 --> 00:51:11.540]  We're good to go.
[00:51:31.857 --> 00:51:33.118]  radioactive poisoning.
[00:51:33.218 --> 00:51:39.101]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:51:39.301 --> 00:51:44.384]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:51:44.504 --> 00:51:53.409]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:58.532]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:52:01.334 --> 00:52:02.336]  803-4438.
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.463]  Call now and get free shipping.
[00:52:05.683 --> 00:52:06.024]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:10.555 --> 00:52:12.216]  I really needed to lose weight.
[00:52:12.256 --> 00:52:13.857]  I was tired, lethargic.
[00:52:14.057 --> 00:52:19.219]  So far, using the collagenate, I've lost 46 pounds.
[00:52:19.239 --> 00:52:21.520]  46 pounds with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.621]  Bernadine, tell me about those inches.
[00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:27.383]  Inches off of my chest, my waist, my hips, my thighs.
[00:52:27.683 --> 00:52:31.184]  I was at about a 20, pushing into a size 22.
[00:52:31.264 --> 00:52:33.185]  I'm down to a size 14.
[00:52:33.585 --> 00:52:35.346]  People have been telling me I look younger.
[00:52:35.806 --> 00:52:39.328]  I've lost 46 pounds with collagenate.
[00:52:39.648 --> 00:52:42.130]  It's just one of the best investments I've ever made.
[00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:48.415]  I am so glad that Bernadine took my advice to lose weight the safe and healthy way with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:52:48.675 --> 00:52:52.278]  That was Bernadine's personal experience, and it can be yours next.
[00:52:52.358 --> 00:52:53.199]  What are you waiting for?
[00:52:53.539 --> 00:52:54.760]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:55.061]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:52:55.081 --> 00:52:56.562]  And get $25 off a three-month supply of collagenate.
[00:52:56.582 --> 00:52:57.202]  Call now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:52:57.483 --> 00:52:57.743]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:53:11.533 --> 00:53:15.875]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:53:16.055 --> 00:53:20.477]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:53:20.637 --> 00:53:24.999]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:53:25.039 --> 00:53:26.380]  The New World Order.
[00:53:27.162 --> 00:53:27.562]  We're good to go.
[00:53:27.662 --> 00:53:28.643]  We're good to go.
[00:53:55.363 --> 00:53:55.744]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:53:55.784 --> 00:53:56.965]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:54:13.596 --> 00:54:14.116]  Don't worry.
[00:54:14.556 --> 00:54:16.077]  This show is documented.
[00:54:16.617 --> 00:54:19.398]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:19.758 --> 00:54:23.320]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.641]  I went down, down, down.
[00:54:26.041 --> 00:54:28.142]  All right, my friends, we're back live.
[00:54:28.162 --> 00:54:32.263]  Already into the final segment of this first hour.
[00:54:34.724 --> 00:54:39.026]  You know, reading and studying about the Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980s
[00:54:41.027 --> 00:54:52.289]  Time and time again I came across the areas where the Russians would hide the numbers of casualties from the families, from the people, from the population.
[00:54:52.409 --> 00:55:03.372]  They would come back with sealed coffins and say your son or daughter in some cases died in a crash or died in a car wreck and we're going to bury the body and you're not allowed to dig it up and keep your mouth shut.
[00:55:04.272 --> 00:55:08.793]  And in many cases they'd say yeah, your son or daughter died in a military combat but
[00:55:09.801 --> 00:55:15.663]  You can't tell anybody that, and it can't be on their tombstone, on their grave marker, or we'll have you arrested.
[00:55:16.103 --> 00:55:28.026]  And in many other cases, they'd say, say whatever you want, because just because the family got told it was never in the newspaper, and the families didn't know all the other families who'd lost loved ones, so the real numbers of deaths never really got out.
[00:55:29.179 --> 00:55:29.519]  We're good to go.
[00:55:29.539 --> 00:55:29.779]  I think?
[00:55:52.914 --> 00:55:59.576]  They are not allowing people who work for the government in and around the dead bodies to talk to the press.
[00:55:59.997 --> 00:56:02.217]  They put them under a national security order.
[00:56:02.637 --> 00:56:04.358]  They're building all these big morgues.
[00:56:04.418 --> 00:56:06.399]  They've ordered a bunch of body bags.
[00:56:08.079 --> 00:56:18.023]  And meanwhile, I'm reading out of Arab and Islamic and foreign papers, British papers, that have been very credible in the past, about thousands of dead U.S.
[00:56:18.063 --> 00:56:18.383]  troops.
[00:56:18.523 --> 00:56:19.623]  Thousands of dead.
[00:56:19.903 --> 00:56:21.444]  Hundreds of dead British troops.
[00:56:22.239 --> 00:56:23.802]  Dozens of dead polls.
[00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:26.828]  It's being covered up, folks.
[00:56:27.765 --> 00:56:36.609]  And you add to this the White House executive orders, presidential directives about not letting anyone know about the numbers of dead.
[00:56:36.669 --> 00:56:37.950]  It is very, very serious.
[00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:45.453]  And I guess they don't even care if they get caught because they've already been caught so many other times lying about other stuff, and no one's held accountable.
[00:56:45.493 --> 00:56:46.273]  It's like Bill Clinton.
[00:56:46.774 --> 00:56:53.216]  Bill Clinton was there to drag our psyche through the mud, to train us, to lower the bar for this stuff to be acceptable.
[00:56:54.057 --> 00:56:56.298]  A new military mortuary opens...
[00:56:57.379 --> 00:57:11.465]  And Associated Press, new military mortuary opens, and it says Dover, a new $30 million military mortuary was dedicated at Dover Air Force Base on Monday, a gleaming, brightly lit, state-of-the-art facility.
[00:57:12.526 --> 00:57:14.807]  And they can do thousands of people a month.
[00:57:15.207 --> 00:57:20.069]  And it's lined up with the new national draft they're setting up.
[00:57:20.129 --> 00:57:20.789]  Isn't that nice?
[00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:22.550]  They've got lots of war planned for us.
[00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:23.511]  And guess what?
[00:57:23.551 --> 00:57:26.572]  They've opened four other big mortuaries all over the country.
[00:57:28.127 --> 00:57:35.532]  And they have offered to pay morticians upwards of $100,000 a year to come work for them.
[00:57:35.572 --> 00:57:37.373]  They say there's going to be lots of business.
[00:57:37.813 --> 00:57:40.134]  That came out about two months ago in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:57:40.795 --> 00:57:43.256]  Military and government officials hope it is seldom used.
[00:57:43.376 --> 00:57:48.579]  Pray God that the workload at the facility will be light and the use will be little, said U.S.
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:50.941]  Senator Joseph Biden.
[00:57:51.764 --> 00:57:58.607]  The 70,000 square foot Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs is about twice the size of its predecessor.
[00:57:59.147 --> 00:58:06.270]  It was big enough for the Vietnam War, which was cobbled together in piecemeal fashion over the last half century.
[00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:15.213]  A new mortuary has been in the works for years, but September 11th terrorist attacks prompted Congress to approve funding and to put the project on the fast track.
[00:58:15.273 --> 00:58:16.774]  This is just one of the new ones.
[00:58:16.794 --> 00:58:17.434]  There's four of them.
[00:58:17.978 --> 00:58:21.159]  This was a project that was on the books a long time, said Karen Giles.
[00:58:21.719 --> 00:58:23.260]  But I have a long-term memory.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:33.663]  The Rocky Mountain News talked about these facilities and said they have incinerators and are prepared with moving equipment, heavy earth moving equipment, for mass graves.
[00:58:34.103 --> 00:58:37.204]  That's in the concentration camp section of Prison Planet, by the way.
[00:58:37.724 --> 00:58:41.386]  For the Rocky Mountain News, this is for you, too.
[00:58:41.886 --> 00:58:44.046]  It's not just for the troops.
[00:58:44.487 --> 00:58:45.827]  You might get to be part of it.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.141]  As they re-engineer our society.
[00:58:49.301 --> 00:58:51.602]  Yes, mass graves and incinerators.
[00:58:51.663 --> 00:58:55.164]  Maybe you've heard of the Rocky Mountain News, one of the big two papers of the state.
[00:58:55.985 --> 00:58:58.086]  We'll be right back with more calls and more news.
[00:59:00.847 --> 00:59:09.451]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:11.352]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing...
[00:59:15.001 --> 00:59:19.042]  You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:59:26.423 --> 00:59:27.083]  Big Brother.
[00:59:27.723 --> 00:59:28.764]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:29.504 --> 00:59:30.604]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:31.244 --> 00:59:32.064]  You want answers?
[00:59:32.824 --> 00:59:33.745]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:34.405 --> 00:59:38.145]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:38.566 --> 00:59:40.926]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:59:41.818 --> 00:59:42.679]  Alex Jones.
[00:59:55.065 --> 00:59:57.767]  Actually, I've got two news articles on this.
[00:59:58.487 --> 01:00:09.473]  They've built a new mortuary in upstate New York, another in Colorado, and two others, but they don't list where these are based.
[01:00:10.501 --> 01:00:11.042]  We're good to go.
[01:00:31.107 --> 01:00:35.190]  Out of the Toronto Star, Pentagon keeps dead out of sight.
[01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:38.933]  Bush team doesn't want people to see human cost of war.
[01:00:39.414 --> 01:00:43.837]  Even body bags are now sanitized as transfer tubes.
[01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:50.065]  Charles H. Burring came home last week.
[01:00:50.085 --> 01:00:53.008]  He arrived at Air Force Base in Dover, Delaware.
[01:00:53.568 --> 01:01:01.655]  So again, they've got one in Colorado, the one in Dover, Delaware, and one in upstate New York at Fort Drum.
[01:01:01.755 --> 01:01:03.017]  So I don't know which one.
[01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:06.740]  It says they've got one here in Colorado, but I don't know where in Colorado.
[01:01:07.443 --> 01:01:09.584]  I have to call this reporter and try to do a search on it.
[01:01:10.064 --> 01:01:17.526]  He arrived at the Air Force Base in Dover, Delaware, in the middle of the night in an aluminum shipping case draped in an American flag.
[01:01:20.987 --> 01:01:22.448]  Actually, I have three articles on this.
[01:01:24.068 --> 01:01:25.049]  Where is the fourth one?
[01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:28.089]  Do any of you know where the fourth new mortuary has been built?
[01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:35.992]  I know they expanded a mortuary at Fort Sam Houston, the medical center down in San Antonio, but that's not listed here.
[01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:43.275]  When the military drove his remains across the tarmac, workers paused and removed their hats.
[01:01:44.236 --> 01:02:00.169]  He was met by six-member honor guard acting as pallbearers to allow a dignified transfer of Charles C. Carson mortuary, where he became one of the estimated 60,000 American casualties of the war that had been processed there over almost five decades.
[01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:03.171]  It reminds us we are at war.
[01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.153]  I'm sorry, Colonel John Anderson.
[01:02:05.393 --> 01:02:06.134]  Nobody declared it.
[01:02:06.775 --> 01:02:09.797]  Who describes business at the Dover Mortuary as steady.
[01:02:10.398 --> 01:02:22.166]  But America never saw Lieutenant Colonel's arrival days after a rocket from a homemade launcher ended his life at age 40 in Baghdad's heavily fortified Rashid Hotel last Monday.
[01:02:22.186 --> 01:02:27.230]  And by the way, Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfiewicz barely missed that.
[01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:34.515]  Americans have never seen any of the 359 bodies returning from Iraq, nor do they see the wounded...
[01:02:35.833 --> 01:02:43.459]  Cramming the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington are soldiers who say they are being treated inhumanely awaiting medical treatment at Fort Stewart, Georgia.
[01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:45.840]  The media is not allowed in.
[01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:48.682]  Sounds like Russia or Germany or China.
[01:02:49.183 --> 01:02:53.426]  Before, the media could go in there, but not even print media now, folks.
[01:02:54.855 --> 01:03:09.311]  And out in Colorado, we have the Rocky Mountain News from a year and a half ago where the governor said, yeah, we got mass graves and incinerators at unnamed facilities with the Army to get rid of masses of dead bodies if we're hit with a bioweapon.
[01:03:11.073 --> 01:03:15.838]  So from Colorado to Delaware to upstate New York,
[01:03:16.965 --> 01:03:20.226]  ...to Fort Sam Houston down in San Antonio.
[01:03:20.806 --> 01:03:22.147]  They are really gearing up for this.
[01:03:22.187 --> 01:03:33.410]  There was a Houston Chronicle article a couple months ago about how they are now upwards of $100,000 to hire morticians because they've got a lot of business.
[01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:37.291]  Then you add that with this article, bodies of 500 U.S.
[01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:37.491]  and U.K.
[01:03:37.511 --> 01:03:39.531]  soldiers lying in a huge mortuary, and this...
[01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:48.956]  Is out of the Pakistan Tribune, which has been pretty accurate in the past.
[01:03:49.597 --> 01:03:52.683]  And from November 3rd, that's today, folks.
[01:03:52.724 --> 01:03:54.407]  So I'm going to go over this.
[01:03:54.467 --> 01:03:56.712]  Then we're going to go to your calls.
[01:03:57.635 --> 01:04:00.336]  We're going to talk to Bob and Elias and others that are holding.
[01:04:00.376 --> 01:04:06.697]  If you want to join us and talk about this or anything concerning World War III and what you think is going to happen in Iraq in the next year, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:06.717 --> 01:04:07.277]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:07.317 --> 01:04:10.437]  I'm Alex Jones, and my job is getting you to think outside the box.
[01:04:10.697 --> 01:04:11.758]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:11.778 --> 01:04:14.278]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:04:26.039 --> 01:04:27.340]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:33.282]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:04:33.543 --> 01:04:38.805]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:04:39.105 --> 01:04:43.207]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:04:43.407 --> 01:04:47.211]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:04:47.472 --> 01:04:52.117]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:04:52.197 --> 01:04:58.464]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:04:58.504 --> 01:05:00.326]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:05:00.806 --> 01:05:02.889]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[01:05:02.969 --> 01:05:05.551]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:05.692 --> 01:05:09.356]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:10.116 --> 01:05:14.521]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:05:14.621 --> 01:05:16.623]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[01:05:16.844 --> 01:05:18.365]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:05:18.546 --> 01:05:20.608]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:21.985]  Hello, folks.
[01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:22.986]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:05:23.366 --> 01:05:29.111]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:29.371 --> 01:05:34.494]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:34.835 --> 01:05:44.161]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:44.481 --> 01:05:49.425]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:53.771]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:58.759]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:05:59.099 --> 01:06:04.968]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:14.383]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:06:14.563 --> 01:06:15.525]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:06:15.625 --> 01:06:16.647]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:22.245]  We're good to go.
[01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.771]  The two most complete protein superfoods known.
[01:06:45.131 --> 01:06:47.612]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water.
[01:06:47.932 --> 01:06:55.054]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you to homeostasis.
[01:06:55.354 --> 01:06:59.035]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:01.896]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[01:07:02.156 --> 01:07:07.098]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.
[01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:10.119]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.740]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:14.682]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, I'm here live.
[01:07:37.142 --> 01:07:52.885]  And of course, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, going out on a growing number of wonderful AM and FM affiliates, simulcasting at Infowars.com and net, and radiating out globally on shortwave.
[01:07:52.905 --> 01:08:01.246]  Before we go to Bob, Elias, Mark, and many others that are patiently holding, I just want to recap what we're talking about today.
[01:08:01.746 --> 01:08:05.547]  I rarely say, hey, I got a topic, and I want to talk about this.
[01:08:06.357 --> 01:08:07.959]  I let the listeners set the agenda.
[01:08:07.979 --> 01:08:23.413]  I mean, I'll spend about half the program talking about news stories I think are important, having guests on, but about 50% of the time I just let you set the agenda because it's usually so interesting and you take us in different directions and angles that I wouldn't have gone in or wouldn't have thought to have gone in.
[01:08:23.913 --> 01:08:33.242]  And you give us your eyewitness reports or you cover local news items and bring us up to speed on what's going on to give us a really good view of what's going on around the country and the world.
[01:08:34.975 --> 01:08:35.675]  We're good to go.
[01:08:57.763 --> 01:09:01.326]  To have people on from England for you generally if you have the right long distance.
[01:09:01.346 --> 01:09:06.149]  So if you ever want to call in from overseas, we'd like to hear from you too at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:14.314]  Just dial your country access code, our country access code, and get on board with us at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:09:14.334 --> 01:09:22.780]  But to recap what we're going over, 18 die in second deadliest day for U.S.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.121]  troops in Iraq.
[01:09:25.385 --> 01:09:30.967]  Eighteen Americans died in guerrilla attacks in Iraq on Sunday, including 15 soldiers, now 16 soldiers.
[01:09:30.987 --> 01:09:35.749]  Another one died when a helicopter was downed in the deadliest single strike on U.S.
[01:09:35.769 --> 01:09:38.350]  forces since they invaded Al-Saddam Hussein.
[01:09:39.351 --> 01:09:43.112]  And on average, more troops are dying every week than died at the first war.
[01:09:43.793 --> 01:09:53.517]  It was the second deadliest day overall for Americans in Iraq since the invasion on March 20th, after 28 soldiers died in various attacks on March 23rd.
[01:09:55.751 --> 01:10:00.255]  So again, folks, I'm looking at AP, Reuters, all these different papers.
[01:10:00.315 --> 01:10:02.197]  Some are saying 18 dead.
[01:10:02.237 --> 01:10:03.619]  Some are saying 20-something dead.
[01:10:03.779 --> 01:10:04.419]  I don't know.
[01:10:04.439 --> 01:10:06.161]  It's just a lot of troops are getting killed.
[01:10:07.782 --> 01:10:08.843]  On Sunday, one U.S.
[01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:20.895]  soldier was killed in a bomb attack in Baghdad, and two American civilian contractors died on the roadside when a mine blasted in the town of Fuljala, a fiercely anti-American center 30 miles west of the capital.
[01:10:22.717 --> 01:10:23.978]  Very, very seriously.
[01:10:23.998 --> 01:10:25.339]  A serious issue.
[01:10:25.659 --> 01:10:28.041]  Clearly, it is a tragic day for Americans.
[01:10:28.081 --> 01:10:33.445]  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told ABC Television, You could care less, Rumsfeld.
[01:10:34.706 --> 01:10:36.627]  At least Rumsfeld's serving the military, though.
[01:10:36.667 --> 01:10:37.908]  The rest of them are chicken hawks.
[01:10:38.309 --> 01:10:39.349]  Just him and Colin Powell.
[01:10:41.191 --> 01:10:42.732]  So they all got deferments.
[01:10:43.292 --> 01:10:44.893]  So that's just one of the articles here.
[01:10:45.894 --> 01:10:48.156]  Again, Pentagon keeps dead out of sight.
[01:10:48.996 --> 01:10:49.456]  We're good to go.
[01:10:49.476 --> 01:10:49.936]  We're good to go.
[01:11:17.228 --> 01:11:19.610]  Reported back, he saw a mass grave of dead U.S.
[01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:27.675]  soldiers, and within 30 minutes of filing that report, a tank drove right up to him as he stood there with his camera, even videotaped it, and machine-gunned him.
[01:11:30.517 --> 01:11:37.061]  So that's your free country, folks, where, again, the media is not allowed to get in to see our soldiers, even in the U.S.,
[01:11:38.806 --> 01:11:39.366]  We're good to go.
[01:11:39.386 --> 01:11:40.367]  We're good to go.
[01:11:40.387 --> 01:11:41.748]  We're good to go.
[01:12:00.578 --> 01:12:12.138]  Around 500 dead bodies of American and British soldiers killed during military operation in Afghanistan after the September 11th Blitz have been lying in a morgue at the Shabazz Air Base in...
[01:12:13.306 --> 01:12:28.833]  Jakobabad, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, American and British authorities, because of a fear of strong reaction from their masses, had kept the dead bodies for as many as 500 soldiers in a morgue established at the airbase instead of shifting them to their own countries.
[01:12:28.873 --> 01:12:31.955]  Credible sources informed online here Tuesday.
[01:12:32.535 --> 01:12:42.880]  The bodies of these soldiers who were killed during the last five months in Afghanistan were brought from the Bagram Airbase and other areas of the war-ravaged country, sources disclosed.
[01:12:44.352 --> 01:12:50.355]  And again, I was talking to family this weekend who's in special forces, in logistics, you name it, and they would not talk.
[01:12:51.055 --> 01:12:52.116]  And they were freaked out.
[01:12:52.916 --> 01:12:55.597]  And I said, are we losing a lot of people?
[01:12:55.657 --> 01:12:57.118]  And they just said, I can't talk about it.
[01:12:57.978 --> 01:12:59.179]  And they just said, it's bad.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:01.820]  It's bad, folks.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.402]  But again, in the past, they didn't admit how many trips we had dying.
[01:13:06.242 --> 01:13:06.882]  Dead and dying.
[01:13:06.922 --> 01:13:07.923]  Now they won't do that.
[01:13:08.877 --> 01:13:17.140]  Now, in the first four years of the Vietnam War, where you had over 400 people die, and that number is now higher than that here, they didn't tell anybody.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:22.262]  It was your son died in an accident while advising freedom fighters in South Vietnam.
[01:13:23.843 --> 01:13:30.946]  I guess it kind of has happened in the past before, but not at this level, not at this massive level, when they admit this is a war.
[01:13:32.697 --> 01:13:33.938]  So those are some of the subjects.
[01:13:34.018 --> 01:13:36.379]  Folks, I've got a whole stack of these news articles here.
[01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:37.339]  It's admitted.
[01:13:37.359 --> 01:13:41.841]  They're not giving people who've had limbs blown off proper treatment.
[01:13:43.202 --> 01:13:47.764]  They will sew it up, stick you in a hospital bed, and then give you no treatment.
[01:13:49.745 --> 01:13:50.865]  Very, very serious.
[01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:51.726]  You're in a car wreck?
[01:13:51.806 --> 01:13:52.206]  Forget it.
[01:13:52.626 --> 01:13:56.128]  You're just going to lay there, in many cases not even getting medication.
[01:13:57.737 --> 01:14:03.281]  Or they'll fly you out to Ramstein or another German base and just tell you, pay for your own plane ticket home.
[01:14:03.321 --> 01:14:04.302]  That's in the news.
[01:14:05.543 --> 01:14:09.105]  And I guess your buddies just wheel you up to the jet and you fly home with your legs blown off.
[01:14:09.886 --> 01:14:15.050]  Our troops have never been treated this bad, even in Korea, according to the experts that are looking at this.
[01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.271]  Let's talk to Bob in New York.
[01:14:17.332 --> 01:14:18.052]  Bob, you're on the air.
[01:14:18.092 --> 01:14:18.492]  Go ahead.
[01:14:18.933 --> 01:14:19.333]  Hi, Alex.
[01:14:19.453 --> 01:14:20.154]  How are you today?
[01:14:20.294 --> 01:14:20.554]  Fine.
[01:14:21.195 --> 01:14:28.901]  Hey, just to hypothesize for a second, if we had gone into Iraq and Baghdad and everything was rosy, how would the U.S.
[01:14:29.161 --> 01:14:34.145]  military, in a general sense of the entire U.S.
[01:14:34.265 --> 01:14:40.830]  Army, for example, how would they ever learn to do counterinsurgency and suppress their own population?
[01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:46.153]  It appears to me like this is an ancillary benefit.
[01:14:46.433 --> 01:14:47.594]  Well, that's not your opinion.
[01:14:47.634 --> 01:14:48.735]  That's an absolute fact.
[01:14:48.795 --> 01:14:56.020]  We have a special forces training manual, some of the newer ones that have been declassified in the last decade, and the U.N.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.303]  talks about having American forces in over 160 countries.
[01:14:59.323 --> 01:14:59.483]  It's not 125.
[01:14:59.523 --> 01:15:00.323]  It's over 160 countries.
[01:15:00.343 --> 01:15:01.324]  I'm not talking about embassy duty.
[01:15:01.344 --> 01:15:01.824]  I mean military duty.
[01:15:07.649 --> 01:15:08.970]  We're good to go.
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:37.584]  And they're doing counterinsurgency, gun confiscation, nighttime roundups, putting the bags over people's heads, taking them to internment camps from the African Gold Coast to Baghdad to the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.
[01:15:37.984 --> 01:15:48.807]  And the globalists say that this is the new policing function of the global army, and we're merging with NATO, we're merging a new naval NATO program,
[01:15:49.447 --> 01:15:50.088]  We're good to go.
[01:16:07.082 --> 01:16:07.722]  We're good to go.
[01:16:29.988 --> 01:16:33.495]  A Waco-like scenario every day, what would you do?
[01:16:33.876 --> 01:16:35.039]  And the globalists love it.
[01:16:35.099 --> 01:16:36.602]  They love it that our troops are dying.
[01:16:36.843 --> 01:16:38.506]  They love it that this is happening.
[01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:41.344]  Yes.
[01:16:41.584 --> 01:16:50.648]  The other issue, while I was waiting to get on here on Fox News, they had an advertisement for the weekly standard, Billy Crystal's Neocon.
[01:16:50.748 --> 01:16:55.070]  Founded by the Communist Fourth International, according to the mainstream media.
[01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:57.271]  This is how weird the commercial was.
[01:16:57.451 --> 01:17:04.574]  I'm watching it, and it's flashing through the video, and they flash to this cover, and there is an American flag.
[01:17:05.255 --> 01:17:08.036]  And in place of the stars, guess what there is?
[01:17:09.496 --> 01:17:10.497]  Take a wild guess.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.461]  The skull and bone.
[01:17:13.502 --> 01:17:14.482]  The Toblenkov.
[01:17:16.484 --> 01:17:19.786]  I highly recommend you get and read Fleshing Out Skull and Bones.
[01:17:21.327 --> 01:17:25.591]  So you're telling me they had an ad where the stars were skull and bones.
[01:17:26.111 --> 01:17:28.012]  The stars were skull and bones.
[01:17:28.073 --> 01:17:29.654]  And I don't know if it was a cover.
[01:17:29.814 --> 01:17:33.637]  I'm looking up on their website to see if I can look at older covers.
[01:17:35.138 --> 01:17:36.299]  But it was so bizarre.
[01:17:36.379 --> 01:17:39.661]  I mean, I just looked at it and it flashed in my head.
[01:17:39.701 --> 01:17:40.602]  I can't believe this.
[01:17:41.463 --> 01:17:46.204]  Talk about subliminal message sending, you know what I mean?
[01:17:47.005 --> 01:17:54.087]  But I hope you have Chris Milligan with his new book, Flushing Out Skull and Bones, on sometime.
[01:17:54.867 --> 01:17:56.768]  Seems like a pretty knowledgeable individual.
[01:17:57.268 --> 01:17:58.728]  And with that, I'll sign off.
[01:17:59.128 --> 01:18:00.589]  Thank you for the call.
[01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:02.349]  Excellent, excellent points.
[01:18:02.389 --> 01:18:04.430]  See, different callers bringing up different issues here.
[01:18:05.137 --> 01:18:05.778]  We're good to go.
[01:18:24.051 --> 01:18:29.454]  And there's the video of people's children, little toddlers, clinging to their daddy out in the sun.
[01:18:30.114 --> 01:18:31.775]  Let's talk to Elias in Michigan.
[01:18:31.835 --> 01:18:32.876]  Go ahead, Elias.
[01:18:33.116 --> 01:18:33.716]  Hi, Alex.
[01:18:33.776 --> 01:18:52.687]  Yeah, what has to happen is left, right, and center in this country, people have got to understand and raise a hue and cry against this fascist administration, Bush and his cabal, and if they won't get out of that country and in a hurry...
[01:18:53.374 --> 01:18:58.118]  Then they will get them out of the White House and the power structures that they are in.
[01:18:58.518 --> 01:18:59.179]  Okay, stay there.
[01:18:59.559 --> 01:19:00.020]  Stay there.
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:01.901]  Stay there, Elias.
[01:19:01.941 --> 01:19:03.382]  I'll let you finish on the other side.
[01:19:04.283 --> 01:19:08.987]  Look, the neocons are nothing but a drill bit on an oil rig.
[01:19:09.227 --> 01:19:10.588]  They don't own the pipe.
[01:19:11.129 --> 01:19:12.130]  They don't own the rig.
[01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:13.211]  They don't own the trucks.
[01:19:13.711 --> 01:19:14.872]  They don't own the pipelines.
[01:19:15.052 --> 01:19:16.093]  They're just minions.
[01:19:16.113 --> 01:19:16.974]  They're just puppets.
[01:19:17.574 --> 01:19:18.895]  We've got to get rid of the New World Order.
[01:19:18.915 --> 01:19:19.496]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:22.177 --> 01:19:23.839]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:26.381]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:52.021]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:19:52.261 --> 01:20:04.209]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:20:04.409 --> 01:20:10.974]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:20:11.174 --> 01:20:14.076]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:19.119 --> 01:20:20.761]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:21.641 --> 01:20:22.462]  Oh my God!
[01:20:22.722 --> 01:20:27.447]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:20:27.707 --> 01:20:31.370]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[01:20:32.952 --> 01:20:33.773]  This is Pat Cooper.
[01:20:33.793 --> 01:20:36.235]  Tony DelVecchio is coming to this station very soon.
[01:20:36.315 --> 01:20:36.855]  I'm sweet.
[01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:38.297]  I book any day now.
[01:20:38.717 --> 01:20:39.558]  You're going to love his show.
[01:20:41.286 --> 01:20:46.470]  That's all about this with your host, Tony DelVecchio, Saturday evenings from 9 to 10 p.m.
[01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:49.752]  Central Time, right here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:20:51.235 --> 01:20:52.155]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[01:20:52.175 --> 01:20:59.336]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[01:20:59.596 --> 01:21:02.477]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.

[01:21:28.993 --> 01:21:31.234]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[01:21:36.815 --> 01:21:37.395]  We're good to go.
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:01.040]  Late summer 2003.
[01:22:24.298 --> 01:22:25.719]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[01:22:58.678 --> 01:22:59.939]  The Alex Jones Show is brought to you by
[01:23:28.982 --> 01:23:31.384]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:32.485 --> 01:23:34.667]  All right, Elias, go ahead and finish up, sir.
[01:23:52.230 --> 01:23:54.871]  And it does not need to be done with this way.
[01:23:55.071 --> 01:23:58.052]  If they want oil, go and buy it from the people who are living there.
[01:23:58.332 --> 01:23:59.493]  Don't go and steal it.
[01:23:59.713 --> 01:24:00.893]  Don't go and murder them.
[01:24:01.813 --> 01:24:02.834]  Oh, Somalia.
[01:24:03.094 --> 01:24:06.455]  Oh, soon they'll be dragging the soldiers through the streets with ropes.
[01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:09.056]  But the people here will slumber on.
[01:24:09.076 --> 01:24:11.957]  The human crime needs to be raised now.
[01:24:12.957 --> 01:24:13.797]  Well, I'll tell you.
[01:24:13.837 --> 01:24:14.678]  It's going to be too late.
[01:24:15.018 --> 01:24:16.058]  It'll be too late.
[01:24:17.099 --> 01:24:17.779]  Well, sir.
[01:24:17.859 --> 01:24:19.379]  Americans, wake up.
[01:24:19.599 --> 01:24:21.040]  If you're listening, wake up.
[01:24:22.216 --> 01:24:22.676]  Too late.
[01:24:23.797 --> 01:24:24.518]  They're getting ready.
[01:24:24.798 --> 01:24:30.162]  All these repressive laws, they are ready for when the economic collapse comes here.
[01:24:30.182 --> 01:24:35.006]  And when you're thrown off your properties, everything will be ready for you.
[01:24:35.327 --> 01:24:40.691]  Don't even give them a dirty look when they come with the guns and throw you out in the streets in the snow and the sleet.
[01:24:41.472 --> 01:24:43.433]  Don't give them a dirty look, because then you'll get a 20.
[01:24:43.533 --> 01:24:45.435]  They'll put you in.
[01:24:45.695 --> 01:24:47.296]  They won't give you a 10-er, they'll give you a 20-er.
[01:24:48.593 --> 01:24:49.414]  And you will be done.
[01:24:49.714 --> 01:24:51.315]  Wake up now.
[01:24:51.415 --> 01:24:52.316]  It's already too late.
[01:24:52.556 --> 01:24:58.800]  Elias, what you were... Go ahead.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.081]  It may be too late now.
[01:25:02.102 --> 01:25:03.783]  Americans, where are you?
[01:25:04.024 --> 01:25:04.664]  Where are they?
[01:25:05.384 --> 01:25:09.167]  They should be raising, pardon the language, H-E-L-L.
[01:25:10.148 --> 01:25:11.308]  That's what they should be doing.
[01:25:11.529 --> 01:25:14.971]  Not sitting back on their couches watching the guffaw's
[01:25:21.526 --> 01:25:24.227]  Sure, Elias, I'm going to say something now, just real quick here.
[01:25:25.488 --> 01:25:29.590]  Look, again, though, we have all the oil we need in Alaska.
[01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:30.710]  This is about control.
[01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:32.331]  It is not about oil over there.
[01:25:33.051 --> 01:25:35.872]  People keep saying, oh, well, see, Bush didn't care about oil.
[01:25:36.392 --> 01:25:37.853]  Oil's not flowing out of the country.
[01:25:38.213 --> 01:25:38.773]  Let me finish.
[01:25:38.813 --> 01:25:39.374]  Let me finish.
[01:25:39.434 --> 01:25:39.934]  We just talked.
[01:25:43.743 --> 01:25:46.465]  Because I get accused of not letting people talk, but then when I try to talk, I'm unable to.
[01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:52.048]  What I'm trying to say here is that what does it do by Iraq's oil not flowing?
[01:25:52.088 --> 01:25:54.849]  That jacks up the prices of the oil around it.
[01:25:55.230 --> 01:25:56.410]  This is about monopoly.
[01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:57.471]  This is about control.
[01:26:00.894 --> 01:26:01.414]  Go ahead now.
[01:26:01.634 --> 01:26:02.675]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:26:03.035 --> 01:26:05.296]  But the monopolizers need to be evicted.
[01:26:05.356 --> 01:26:15.520]  If they aren't given the message and clear from huge numbers of people, left, right, and center, I don't care where their politics lie, because they better forget their politics.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:22.623]  They're in the hands of a regime that is intent on one thing, like you say, just monopolizing, grabbing everything.
[01:26:22.963 --> 01:26:25.644]  Whether they're going to use it now or what they're going to do with it, they got it.
[01:26:26.005 --> 01:26:29.066]  And to swagger into somebody's country and do this...
[01:26:29.546 --> 01:26:31.708]  That country does not belong to you, Bush.
[01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:34.411]  That country does not belong to us.
[01:26:34.991 --> 01:26:35.372]  I hear you.
[01:26:35.432 --> 01:26:37.154]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:37.174 --> 01:26:38.635]  Appreciate that, Elias.
[01:26:38.675 --> 01:26:41.077]  And that's the type of passion we need to be hearing from people.
[01:26:41.117 --> 01:26:46.783]  But look, I gave the analogy kind of haphazardly in the last ten seconds of the last segment.
[01:26:47.868 --> 01:26:54.129]  All the Bush administration is, figuratively, is the drill bit of the New World Order right now.
[01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:55.350]  They can replace drill bits.
[01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:56.590]  They can put in Democrats.
[01:26:57.430 --> 01:27:00.351]  They can bring in Europe and the UN as the savers of Iraq.
[01:27:00.711 --> 01:27:03.471]  We need to look at the mechanism, the structure of world government.
[01:27:03.791 --> 01:27:04.392]  Who owns it?
[01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:05.132]  Who controls it?
[01:27:05.372 --> 01:27:06.732]  Who gives us Saddam Hussein?
[01:27:07.272 --> 01:27:08.372]  Who gives us the Shah?
[01:27:08.852 --> 01:27:10.293]  Who gives us Adolf Hitler?
[01:27:10.513 --> 01:27:14.114]  Who put Mao into power, now admitted to be the CIA, folks, in 1949?
[01:27:14.254 --> 01:27:14.754]  That's admitted!
[01:27:17.037 --> 01:27:19.318]  Who gave North Korea the nuclear reactors?
[01:27:19.858 --> 01:27:21.920]  Who gives us the best enemies money can buy?
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.320]  Absolutely, Elias.
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.721]  I appreciate your fine points, sir.
[01:27:25.822 --> 01:27:27.022]  Mark in Minnesota.
[01:27:27.062 --> 01:27:27.662]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:27:30.544 --> 01:27:30.824]  Hello?
[01:27:31.264 --> 01:27:31.945]  Yeah, you're on the air.
[01:27:31.965 --> 01:27:32.305]  Go ahead.
[01:27:32.485 --> 01:27:33.826]  No, this is Dino from New York, Alex.
[01:27:34.046 --> 01:27:34.666]  Okay, sure.
[01:27:34.706 --> 01:27:35.386]  We'll talk to Dino.
[01:27:35.426 --> 01:27:35.847]  Go ahead.
[01:27:35.867 --> 01:27:37.427]  Hey, I just want to share with something.
[01:27:37.467 --> 01:27:38.808]  I want to give people something to thought.
[01:27:38.988 --> 01:27:43.871]  What I'm about to tell you, even though it's more concerned with seniors and retirees, is for seniors...
[01:27:44.884 --> 01:27:47.146]  And retirees caregivers and even the ones to retire.
[01:27:47.806 --> 01:27:52.770]  This new drug bill to give prescription drugs to the seniors, here's the thing they didn't tell you about it.
[01:27:52.830 --> 01:28:03.319]  Would you believe there's a hidden encouragement voluntary tax that they want you to start getting deductions to help build up a cash roll to fund this plan for the current retirees?
[01:28:03.899 --> 01:28:05.220]  Number one, it's not voluntary.
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.221]  And we read the articles yesterday.
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.643]  Monday, I should say, or Friday.
[01:28:26.663 --> 01:28:27.424]  Today's Monday.
[01:28:27.444 --> 01:28:37.158]  We went over this last Friday with what's happening with socialized health care, where they have it socialized in England.
[01:28:37.238 --> 01:28:40.042]  If you're above 70, they won't give you cancer surgery.
[01:28:40.675 --> 01:28:43.537]  And the wait's already almost a year long.
[01:28:43.637 --> 01:28:48.560]  So this is the wonders of socialism, but the profits are going to be privatized, Dino.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:48.920]  Stay there.
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:49.741]  I'll let you finish up.
[01:28:49.861 --> 01:28:50.801]  Okay, thank you.
[01:28:50.821 --> 01:28:51.181]  You bet.
[01:28:51.301 --> 01:28:55.784]  On the other side, the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:56.505 --> 01:29:06.431]  We'll keep this whole Iraq situation discussion going because it feeds into the larger goals of the globalists.
[01:29:06.471 --> 01:29:08.512]  That's all coming up after the break, so please stay with us.
[01:29:12.074 --> 01:29:12.975]  We're on the march.
[01:29:13.475 --> 01:29:15.097]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.820]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:22.062 --> 01:29:23.063]  Hi, this is Joyce Reiling.
[01:29:23.123 --> 01:29:26.066]  As a nurse, I know the dangers of toxins and heavy metals in the body.
[01:29:26.386 --> 01:29:31.470]  Chelation treatments can rid the body of these toxins, but it can be expensive, time-consuming, and inconvenient.
[01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:33.532]  But now there's Detoximin.
[01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:37.295]  Dr. Bruce Halstead, the grandfather of EDTA chelation therapy, says that
[01:29:37.615 --> 01:29:42.620]  Detoxamine is the only chelation suppository product on the market that has all the following attributes.
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:49.066]  It's legal, safe, comfortable to use, and has documented proof of its consistent effectiveness in its ability to chelate.
[01:29:49.546 --> 01:29:56.032]  Ten chelation treatments would cost about $1,000, but you can get approximately the same amount of chelation therapy for $289.95.
[01:29:56.453 --> 01:30:02.278]  This is an amazing breakthrough, and now you can rid your body of heavy metals and toxins in the privacy of your own home.
[01:30:02.678 --> 01:30:03.078]  We're good to go.
[01:30:22.472 --> 01:30:33.225]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:40.975]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:30:41.215 --> 01:30:41.976]  We're good to go.
[01:30:57.174 --> 01:31:01.075]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:31:01.115 --> 01:31:02.995]  The water level is always visible.
[01:31:03.195 --> 01:31:09.116]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:31:09.376 --> 01:31:13.137]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:31:13.217 --> 01:31:13.897]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:31:22.259 --> 01:31:23.020]  Oh my God!
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:28.003]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:31:28.303 --> 01:31:28.964]  Yes, it's true.
[01:31:29.064 --> 01:31:31.765]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:31:31.885 --> 01:31:35.908]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:31:36.028 --> 01:31:36.569]  You heard it right.
[01:31:36.769 --> 01:31:41.772]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:31:41.872 --> 01:31:42.312]  We're good to go.
[01:31:59.377 --> 01:31:59.917]  We're good to go.
[01:31:59.937 --> 01:32:00.638]  We're good to go.
[01:32:27.063 --> 01:32:28.984]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:29.444 --> 01:32:32.264]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:34.805 --> 01:32:36.966]  Bringing you the news behind the news.
[01:32:38.366 --> 01:32:43.548]  Exposing the infrastructure of neo-serfdom, tyranny, slavery, the New World Order.
[01:32:44.508 --> 01:32:45.528]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:32:45.548 --> 01:32:48.409]  I'm going to take two more calls this hour, just from Dino and Mark.
[01:32:49.890 --> 01:33:06.861]  And if you want to drop off the line, that's fine if you're holding, or if you want to call back in in the next hour, because I need to get into a whole other section of immigration, forced vaccination, police state news, and then, of course, more on the situation in Iraq and how that feeds into the larger globalist agenda.
[01:33:08.242 --> 01:33:14.626]  But what Dino talks about with prescription drugs, you know, they talk about how expensive the prescription drugs are.
[01:33:14.686 --> 01:33:17.928]  Well, that's because you've got oligopolies and price-fixing going on
[01:33:19.241 --> 01:33:19.682]  We're good to go.
[01:33:40.598 --> 01:33:42.680]  And this is how they run their little scams.
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:52.227]  And then they say, oh, the answer is, since we've taken your jobs and taken your economy and raided Social Security and set up all these scams, we'll just socialize health care now.
[01:33:52.967 --> 01:34:07.418]  And now they have control over the doctors and over the hospitals, and now they're engaging in law enforcement type activities against you, tattling and spying on you, and they're putting in the bioethics boards, which is just the new form of eugenics,
[01:34:07.998 --> 01:34:08.418]  We're good to go.
[01:34:08.438 --> 01:34:09.139]  We're good to go.
[01:34:33.977 --> 01:34:42.040]  And who knows what a bioethics board will try to do, but think about 10, 20 years from now when you need that health care and it's totally socialized.
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:49.864]  I remember two years ago they passed that Patients' Rights or Patients' Privacy Act, and the news was saying this will give you privacy.
[01:34:49.924 --> 01:34:58.647]  What it did was bring in more federal control over your local clinics and health care providers and dentists and then made all your data available.
[01:34:59.688 --> 01:35:00.668]  So it did the opposite.
[01:35:01.218 --> 01:35:07.702]  But again, the average person heard, oh, it's a reform of health care privacy.
[01:35:07.762 --> 01:35:10.104]  It's like campaign finance reform.
[01:35:11.304 --> 01:35:16.828]  The word reform means to some people something good, when really it's a neutral term.
[01:35:16.868 --> 01:35:28.435]  It just means changing the shape or the operation of something, and all it did was double the money that corporations can give but restrict the money you can give and then restrict who can come on this show 60 days before an election.
[01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:34.333]  They say I can't have political groups or 501c3s on this show.
[01:35:34.913 --> 01:35:39.116]  I can't interview Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America before an election.
[01:35:39.376 --> 01:35:40.657]  That's not a free society.
[01:35:41.098 --> 01:35:42.338]  Dino, go ahead and finish up.
[01:35:42.579 --> 01:35:43.499]  Yeah, just two things.
[01:35:43.699 --> 01:35:50.304]  Now, the other thing, part of this provision is, did you know, well, Alex probably was aware of it, but I'm talking about most of the American public out there.
[01:35:50.884 --> 01:35:57.169]  Do you know that if your company is paying for your prescription drugs now, when they put this new program in, your company...
[01:35:57.754 --> 01:35:58.915]  We're good to go.
[01:35:59.035 --> 01:35:59.335]  I think?
[01:36:15.089 --> 01:36:15.949]  You'll be surprised.
[01:36:16.049 --> 01:36:24.353]  Next year, when the seniors get their increase, their cost of living increase, they're also going to raise their Part B insurance premium, which is deducted off of their check.
[01:36:24.753 --> 01:36:25.833]  The current amount is $58.70.
[01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:26.734]  Next year, it goes to $66.60.
[01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:29.015]  They're telling you people, like Alex tells you,
[01:36:38.763 --> 01:36:53.179]  Well, look, my great-uncle, who, when he got out of the military, worked for like 30 years for a major oil company, he got out of his truck yesterday, sort of talking about how the Republicans are basically communists,
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.241]  He said, you're right about all this.
[01:36:55.281 --> 01:37:04.247]  And he said, I worked for decades for my health care plan, and now under this new deal, they're taking my health care plan that I paid for away from me.
[01:37:04.348 --> 01:37:05.789]  So see, fascism.
[01:37:06.329 --> 01:37:11.393]  What they do is that the private corporations shove you into socialism.
[01:37:11.433 --> 01:37:12.533]  They want to do that.
[01:37:12.914 --> 01:37:14.195]  They want to control you.
[01:37:14.455 --> 01:37:16.216]  They want to force you under their control.
[01:37:16.696 --> 01:37:17.377]  It's horrible.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.641]  But the average person out there is going, this is great.
[01:37:21.021 --> 01:37:22.581]  I'm going to get free drugs.
[01:37:22.902 --> 01:37:24.022]  Yeah, yeah, sure.
[01:37:24.122 --> 01:37:27.063]  Once they've got us transferred over to it, you're going to get nothing.
[01:37:28.323 --> 01:37:29.424]  They already do it in England.
[01:37:29.444 --> 01:37:31.204]  They already do it in Canada.
[01:37:31.444 --> 01:37:33.425]  Folks, I've watched the House of Commons debates.
[01:37:33.965 --> 01:37:39.107]  They're up there going, you wait a year and a half for brain surgery or cancer surgery or any type of surgery.
[01:37:39.447 --> 01:37:41.167]  And Tony Blair gets up and goes, that's not true.
[01:37:41.207 --> 01:37:42.968]  It's only eight and a half months you wait.
[01:37:43.852 --> 01:37:48.314]  Eight and a half months, so they're admitting that you wait almost a year for health care.
[01:37:50.315 --> 01:37:51.796]  So that's the system we'll be under.
[01:37:51.836 --> 01:37:53.117]  Isn't that wonderful, Dino?
[01:37:53.617 --> 01:37:55.538]  Yeah, it is, but I just hope people wake up.
[01:37:56.058 --> 01:38:00.420]  Alex, I'll let you go, because I know you've got other callers and other things, but listen, you and John, hang in there.
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:02.061]  Don't be discouraged, because we need you.
[01:38:02.861 --> 01:38:03.702]  I'm not discouraged.
[01:38:03.722 --> 01:38:05.402]  Man, this show's growing by leaps and bounds.
[01:38:05.482 --> 01:38:10.045]  Oh, I know, but a couple of times, I remember what, an earlier part a couple of months ago there, you were kind of getting down in the dumps.
[01:38:10.165 --> 01:38:10.645]  Hang in there.
[01:38:11.314 --> 01:38:12.174]  Well, I appreciate it.
[01:38:12.214 --> 01:38:20.537]  Look, doing four or five radio interviews a day, doing TV shows, paying the bills, walking the dog, all of it.
[01:38:20.577 --> 01:38:21.378]  But I love it.
[01:38:21.478 --> 01:38:22.238]  I love being alive.
[01:38:22.298 --> 01:38:23.278]  I love being in this fight.
[01:38:23.518 --> 01:38:29.481]  My great frustration, the franticness that you can hear in my voice, is that I've got a clear picture of what's going on.
[01:38:29.801 --> 01:38:33.922]  I know what liars and criminals they are, and it's very frustrating, Dino.
[01:38:33.942 --> 01:38:34.803]  I know.
[01:38:34.923 --> 01:38:35.723]  Alex, I'll let you go.
[01:38:35.983 --> 01:38:36.623]  Okay, thank you.
[01:38:36.643 --> 01:38:37.764]  Yeah, thanks for the call, Dino.
[01:38:37.804 --> 01:38:38.424]  I appreciate it.
[01:38:39.596 --> 01:38:43.497]  Getting back into the news, well, let's take one more quick call, then I'll get into the news.
[01:38:43.777 --> 01:38:45.078]  Mark in Minnesota, go ahead.
[01:38:45.358 --> 01:38:45.958]  Alex, how are you doing?
[01:38:46.078 --> 01:38:46.498]  God bless.
[01:38:47.319 --> 01:38:48.059]  Wait, what is it?
[01:38:48.119 --> 01:38:48.759]  You're a liberal.
[01:38:48.799 --> 01:38:50.600]  You're a liberal left-wing communist.
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:39:07.325]  Anyway, I think the casualties in Iraq, I think this is an excellent opportunity to perhaps give people some instruction on how to read the news and making a say of the news, because in a lot of cases, it's not so much...
[01:39:08.056 --> 01:39:10.778]  What it is you're reading is how you read the news.
[01:39:11.398 --> 01:39:22.164]  Because I saw a hint of psyops, I guess you could say, truth manipulation almost from the very start with some of these articles.
[01:39:22.244 --> 01:39:28.307]  And a lot of people have a very difficult time distinguishing slogans and platitudes from substance.
[01:39:28.827 --> 01:39:35.671]  And it's even more difficult for them to understand how the establishment can take a factual truth and mislead us.
[01:39:36.269 --> 01:39:43.496]  Because some of the titles for articles I would see would be things like, you know, two USGIs die, right?
[01:39:44.317 --> 01:39:48.801]  And I don't know about anybody else, but I totally understand how two relates to 100.
[01:39:50.134 --> 01:39:56.358]  And if, say, 100 soldiers died, could it not also be true that two soldiers died?
[01:39:56.398 --> 01:40:07.546]  So therefore, if they're telling you, I don't know why they would focus in on just two, but if they tell you that two soldiers died, could it not also be true then that, say, actually 100 more died, and they're just not telling you about that?
[01:40:07.566 --> 01:40:08.727]  So I saw a hint.
[01:40:08.867 --> 01:40:16.772]  Well, I've read the actual 1950s British Psychological Warfare Manual that says that, and thanks for the call, Mark.
[01:40:16.812 --> 01:40:19.714]  Let me try to crystallize or condense.
[01:40:20.414 --> 01:40:21.815]  Or focus what you were just saying.
[01:40:23.236 --> 01:40:24.136]  They'll have a headline.
[01:40:24.176 --> 01:40:27.118]  In fact, there's one here today, and it says, Two Troops Die.
[01:40:28.699 --> 01:40:31.160]  So the average person looks at that and says, Two Troops Die.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.923]  The article starts out with, Two troops died when their Humvee ran over a landmine.
[01:40:37.984 --> 01:40:44.267]  Then it says another 16 died when their Chinook helicopter was hit by an RPG.
[01:40:44.307 --> 01:40:45.588]  That's way down in the article.
[01:40:47.205 --> 01:40:49.386]  Then it talks about another 20-something were wounded.
[01:40:50.026 --> 01:40:54.428]  And a couple of private oil field workers, U.S.
[01:40:54.468 --> 01:40:56.029]  citizens, were also killed.
[01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:59.450]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:41:00.651 --> 01:41:09.675]  And I remember being at Barnes & Noble about six years ago in the giant magazine rack.
[01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:11.818]  We're good to go.
[01:41:41.167 --> 01:41:57.232]  And it said, British psychological warfare experts and propagandists who were assigned to the BBC in the 50s did studies where they would have troops or citizens they hired for the studies look at a wheel of fortune.
[01:41:57.852 --> 01:42:03.974]  That is, a big wheel with a dial on it that you spin and it stops on different numbers.
[01:42:06.515 --> 01:42:09.856]  And if they spun the wheel...
[01:42:11.051 --> 01:42:22.039]  And if it stopped on a higher number, they would then ask the people in the study how many countries are in Africa.
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:23.980]  Now follow me.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.281]  This is weird, but it's an example.
[01:42:26.312 --> 01:42:37.441]  And the people reading it or watching the wheel spin, if it stopped on a high number, the majority of them would guess a higher number of countries in Africa.
[01:42:37.541 --> 01:42:38.862]  It had nothing to do with it.
[01:42:38.902 --> 01:42:41.584]  They would just spin a wheel, have it stop on numbers.
[01:42:42.044 --> 01:42:42.885]  I think it was like 1 to 100.
[01:42:43.725 --> 01:42:52.332]  If it stopped on a high number, they would automatically, with the next question, how many countries are in Africa, they would then say a higher number.
[01:42:53.254 --> 01:42:56.997]  And if it stopped on a low number, they would say a lower number of countries were in Africa.
[01:42:57.337 --> 01:43:10.446]  Just seeing that higher number, then having the next question, how many countries are in Africa, which almost no one knew, they would then answer with a higher or lower number depending on where the Wheel of Fortune stopped.
[01:43:11.867 --> 01:43:21.514]  Then the British went on to say, with an example of Africa, when they were in some country and a bunch of British troops were being killed, they would talk about how the British would then...
[01:43:22.702 --> 01:43:27.424]  First plant a false story in the news that four soldiers died.
[01:43:27.444 --> 01:43:28.064]  I remember the number.
[01:43:29.464 --> 01:43:44.610]  And in reality, it would be 200 soldiers, and the next week they would say, okay, 200 actually died, but because people had seen the headline saying four, automatically it would have the psychological effect of them feeling like a lot of soldiers didn't die.
[01:43:45.646 --> 01:43:56.733]  So when you see all these headlines that say several soldiers die or two soldiers die, and then by the time you're done listing all the dead soldiers, it's over 18.
[01:43:58.554 --> 01:44:02.257]  That is a psychological warfare tactic.
[01:44:02.317 --> 01:44:11.563]  And I've read Swiss manuals on resistance, Swiss manuals on propaganda, German, Russian, Chinese, American.
[01:44:11.623 --> 01:44:13.284]  I've read the psychological journals.
[01:44:14.022 --> 01:44:15.744]  I've read dozens of them.
[01:44:16.245 --> 01:44:26.416]  And there's all these little semantical and numerical systems to psychologically manipulate you.
[01:44:28.197 --> 01:44:29.778]  I mean, psychology's real simple.
[01:44:30.078 --> 01:44:41.524]  They'll have a good-looking info babe, licking her lips, smiling at you with desire, radiating sexual desire on Fox News, telling you about how wonderful our troops are.
[01:44:41.964 --> 01:44:51.608]  Psychologically, men are sucked into that and automatically have a good feeling because this good-looking woman is looking them in the eyes, showing desire for them.
[01:44:51.869 --> 01:44:52.889]  That's the effect it has.
[01:44:52.929 --> 01:44:53.449]  They admit it.
[01:44:53.469 --> 01:44:54.930]  There's whole manuals on this.
[01:44:56.511 --> 01:44:56.771]  Okay?
[01:44:59.245 --> 01:45:08.814]  And the same thing goes for the good-looking guy in the suit on the show in the morning or in the afternoon when the women are watching, making them feel good.
[01:45:09.414 --> 01:45:10.856]  Oh, he's so handsome.
[01:45:11.236 --> 01:45:12.197]  I like him.
[01:45:12.297 --> 01:45:15.420]  See, that's basic type psychology.
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:21.005]  It's like the beer commercials with 50 luscious women running around at the beach guzzling Coors Light.
[01:45:21.385 --> 01:45:24.608]  Why, I'll have 50 luscious women if I guzzle Coors Light.
[01:45:24.628 --> 01:45:25.228]  Now you'll get a DWI.
[01:45:28.174 --> 01:45:30.836]  So this is just basic psychology, folks.
[01:45:30.876 --> 01:45:37.039]  I mean, they show all the talking heads and all the good-looking people and all the know-it-all pinheads telling you that there's global warming.
[01:45:37.099 --> 01:45:39.141]  So the average person believes there's global warming.
[01:45:39.621 --> 01:45:42.262]  These are just examples of propaganda.
[01:45:42.523 --> 01:45:45.324]  Look, I know you're smart enough to understand this.
[01:45:45.364 --> 01:45:49.487]  The problem is the average American is totally unconscious to this.
[01:45:50.916 --> 01:45:52.517]  They don't know who Tony Blair's vice president is.
[01:46:19.088 --> 01:46:22.950]  So how do you talk to somebody who doesn't know anything?
[01:46:23.290 --> 01:46:25.231]  You're talking to low-grade morons.
[01:46:25.631 --> 01:46:32.254]  They're not really morons, though, because they know all the football scores, all the baseball scores.
[01:46:34.276 --> 01:46:41.299]  How many yards the running back for UT ran against Nebraska this Saturday?
[01:46:41.319 --> 01:46:50.462]  I mean, I was sitting there at a gas station trying to pay for gas this morning with ten people in front of me babbling like a pack of monkeys about the football game.
[01:46:50.482 --> 01:46:52.223]  And I don't want to hear, oh, you're against football.
[01:46:52.743 --> 01:46:53.843]  I'm not against football.
[01:46:54.043 --> 01:47:04.166]  I am disgusted that most of those people don't know what their rights are, don't know where Iraq is, but they'll give you their opinion on Iraq real fast.
[01:47:06.386 --> 01:47:14.148]  So you've got to change your focus at least a little bit into reality, into history, into knowing what's going on.
[01:47:14.188 --> 01:47:16.768]  It's very exciting, it's wonderful, and it's scary.
[01:47:18.209 --> 01:47:19.749]  I was listening to Dave and Joyce this morning.
[01:47:20.683 --> 01:47:27.085]  And Dave Von Kleist was reading out of Talkers Magazine, the big premier talk radio publication.
[01:47:27.105 --> 01:47:28.346]  I don't have the exact numbers.
[01:47:28.406 --> 01:47:29.226]  I was in my car.
[01:47:29.946 --> 01:47:35.808]  But I think he said 21% of people in a poll said they were conservative that listen to talk radio.
[01:47:37.629 --> 01:47:38.569]  11% call themselves liberal.
[01:47:38.589 --> 01:47:44.851]  50-plus percent, I think it was 56%, consider themselves independent.
[01:47:47.583 --> 01:47:49.224]  Now, I've taken talkers in the past.
[01:47:49.244 --> 01:47:51.004]  I remember five years ago reading the same poll.
[01:47:51.044 --> 01:47:51.805]  They do it every year.
[01:47:52.385 --> 01:47:55.346]  And 50-plus percent considered themselves conservative.
[01:47:56.827 --> 01:47:58.488]  But something's happened, you see.
[01:47:59.428 --> 01:48:02.549]  Now 50-plus percent consider themselves independent.
[01:48:02.649 --> 01:48:03.450]  Why is that?
[01:48:04.290 --> 01:48:06.431]  Because they're getting outside the box.
[01:48:06.971 --> 01:48:09.112]  The Internet is having some real discussions.
[01:48:09.192 --> 01:48:16.535]  Tens of millions of people are tuning out, not just of ABC and CBS and NBC Nightly News, not just Rupert Murdoch's Communist News Channel.
[01:48:17.276 --> 01:48:19.197]  No, neocon phoniness.
[01:48:19.617 --> 01:48:21.518]  They're tuning into shows like this one.
[01:48:23.398 --> 01:48:24.899]  They're tuning into that local show.
[01:48:24.999 --> 01:48:26.639]  They're breaking the paradigm.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.840]  That is a very exciting number, folks.
[01:48:30.681 --> 01:48:31.881]  And look, I've done my own poll.
[01:48:33.682 --> 01:48:39.204]  I've been on over 1,200 radio interviews in the last 26 months, since 9-11.
[01:48:40.804 --> 01:48:43.945]  And again, maybe 100 callers have called that disagree with me.
[01:48:44.125 --> 01:48:45.986]  Tens of thousands have called that agree.
[01:48:46.934 --> 01:48:49.057]  Tens of thousands.
[01:48:49.577 --> 01:48:55.544]  I could be on KFI in New York, WABC, or KFI in LA, WABC in New York.
[01:48:55.564 --> 01:48:57.546]  I could be on KLA in Denver.
[01:48:57.606 --> 01:48:59.929]  I could be on some little mom and pop AM.
[01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:04.795]  I've been all over Canada, England, Germany, Australia.
[01:49:04.815 --> 01:49:06.677]  I mean...
[01:49:07.347 --> 01:49:12.869]  Sometimes I'll be on two hours and they'll take 30 calls and one guy calls in and says, I want to kill you.
[01:49:13.329 --> 01:49:15.530]  You should be in a prison camp for what you're saying.
[01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:19.832]  Everybody else has woken up, but that's that large section.
[01:49:19.872 --> 01:49:33.137]  It is a minority, but that's the tens of millions of people that are tuning in that do know what's going on, that do know what the Fourth Amendment is, that do know where Iraq is, that do know the history.
[01:49:34.019 --> 01:49:41.305]  And we're now educating everybody else, so that's now taking place, and it's very, very exciting.
[01:49:41.625 --> 01:49:50.572]  So the Rush Limbaugh's and the Sean Hannity's and the George Bush's are going to be in the same grouping in people's minds, already in many people's minds, very soon.
[01:49:51.393 --> 01:49:55.736]  Because we know they're traitors, we know they're puppets, we know they're front men, and that's the good news.
[01:49:55.756 --> 01:49:59.619]  When we get back, China to launch moon probe satellite.
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:02.982]  Health fear for children sparks fury over fluoride.
[01:50:04.139 --> 01:50:07.544]  Row over the new link between the MMR injection and autism.
[01:50:08.786 --> 01:50:09.086]  U.S.
[01:50:09.146 --> 01:50:11.209]  measles outbreak poses risk to the U.S.
[01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:13.433]  because of under-vaccination, pure propaganda.
[01:50:14.174 --> 01:50:16.016]  ABC's new show attacks Jesus.
[01:50:17.378 --> 01:50:18.139]  It's all coming up.
[01:50:18.159 --> 01:50:18.520]  Stay with me.
[01:50:22.088 --> 01:50:24.069]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.809]  Hello, folks.
[01:50:24.929 --> 01:50:34.854]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:50:35.234 --> 01:50:39.756]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:50:39.836 --> 01:50:51.162]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:50:51.762 --> 01:50:58.605]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:50:59.005 --> 01:51:01.146]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:51:01.626 --> 01:51:06.609]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:51:06.909 --> 01:51:13.031]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803.
[01:51:16.653 --> 01:51:20.534]  Yes, it's true.
[01:51:20.974 --> 01:51:31.757]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:51:31.897 --> 01:51:35.918]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:51:36.038 --> 01:51:36.598]  You heard it right.
[01:51:36.759 --> 01:51:41.780]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:42.341]  We're good to go.

[01:51:59.965 --> 01:52:00.905]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[01:52:22.346 --> 01:52:26.669]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:52:26.869 --> 01:52:31.272]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:31.433 --> 01:52:35.816]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:52:35.856 --> 01:52:37.197]  The New World Order.
[01:52:37.897 --> 01:52:38.278]  Can emerge.
[01:52:38.979 --> 01:52:43.203]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:52:43.263 --> 01:52:50.211]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:52:50.351 --> 01:52:52.334]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:52.714 --> 01:53:03.058]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:53:03.338 --> 01:53:08.700]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:53:24.841 --> 01:53:30.883]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:31.484 --> 01:53:34.505]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:36.245 --> 01:53:41.527]  Propaganda works very well on people unless they're aware of it.
[01:53:42.588 --> 01:53:43.688]  And the globalists know.
[01:53:44.308 --> 01:53:48.530]  Again, they write white papers to each other that are published in public.
[01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:51.271]  They know that 99.9% of us never see them or read them.
[01:53:52.868 --> 01:53:56.751]  They know that propaganda works wonders unless you're conscious of it.
[01:53:56.811 --> 01:54:00.894]  So they created false layers, false levels.
[01:54:00.934 --> 01:54:08.019]  It's like if you're going to get your house raided for guns, you'll have a fake cash hidden, so when they find that, they think they've gotten it all.
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:10.281]  That's another analogy.
[01:54:12.125 --> 01:54:15.686]  So the globalists know that you're going to break through several layers of the onion.
[01:54:15.706 --> 01:54:25.730]  So they create, oh, the right-wing layer, the left-wing layer, the corporate layer, the corruption layer, where you think you're breaking through all the layers.
[01:54:26.710 --> 01:54:28.891]  So you think that you've found out all the answers.
[01:54:30.191 --> 01:54:38.114]  And that's just for the minority of us that don't trust the media and don't trust the headlines and understand some of the basics of propaganda.
[01:54:38.829 --> 01:54:42.191]  Clayton and Alan and others, I'm going to get to you in the next hour, so folks, be patient.
[01:54:42.571 --> 01:54:45.213]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:45.233 --> 01:54:50.376]  But I've got a bunch of vaccine news here I really need to get to.
[01:54:51.757 --> 01:54:55.559]  And there's all these top scientists and people saying they're against fluoride.
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:58.021]  At least there's a debate now.
[01:54:58.101 --> 01:55:00.862]  Twenty years ago, they just said you're a raving kook if you're against it.
[01:55:01.283 --> 01:55:05.005]  Now there's all these top scientists saying it's deadly, that it's horrible for you.
[01:55:06.002 --> 01:55:10.486]  And it says, a health fear for children sparks fury over fluoride.
[01:55:11.007 --> 01:55:25.641]  London Guardian, sweeping new measures to allow fluoride to be added to large parts of Britain's water supply are set to provoke a huge political debate amid fears that mass medication may harm children and lead to more tooth disease.
[01:55:26.835 --> 01:55:30.920]  Ministers will try to force the new water bill for the House of Commons this week.
[01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:38.729]  At a crucial vote on the issue in nine days, the government will argue that adding fluoride improves dental health, particularly among the young.
[01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:45.737]  But opponents of fluoridation argue that the new government rules would make it easier for water companies to start adding the chemical.
[01:55:46.097 --> 01:55:47.519]  They say that up to half of labor's...
[01:55:48.306 --> 01:55:54.209]  Backbench MPs and many conservative MPs will vote against the bill, putting the government in danger of an embarrassing defeat.
[01:55:54.689 --> 01:56:05.495]  It is mass medication, an additive in the water supply, said Brian DeHul, an MP, a member of parliament for Cunningham, south of Aishire, who is leading the rebellion.
[01:56:06.356 --> 01:56:10.698]  And then it gets into one of the government's most senior advisors on science,
[01:56:11.741 --> 01:56:12.441]  We're good to go.
[01:56:12.481 --> 01:56:12.861]  I think?
[01:56:42.145 --> 01:56:52.232]  It's the toxic waste from aluminum and fertilizer production, aluminum purification and manufacturing and fertilizer production, with all these other poisons added.
[01:56:52.392 --> 01:56:54.954]  It's deadly poison!
[01:56:56.295 --> 01:56:59.156]  And yes, it is a toxic sedative.
[01:56:59.797 --> 01:57:01.078]  This is proven.
[01:57:01.598 --> 01:57:03.539]  Hundreds of university studies.
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:10.084]  They were using it in the 20s as a sedative to give lunatics...
[01:57:11.198 --> 01:57:12.859]  No wonder we're so stupid.
[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:15.221]  We're on a mind-numbing toxin.
[01:57:16.543 --> 01:57:19.345]  We're on snake poison in the water supply, basically.
[01:57:20.686 --> 01:57:23.609]  Might as well put cobra poison in there, a neurotoxin.
[01:57:24.990 --> 01:57:26.051]  I'm out of time for this hour.
[01:57:26.071 --> 01:57:27.852]  I'm going to launch into a couple calls.
[01:57:27.872 --> 01:57:28.733]  I've been holding a long time.
[01:57:28.753 --> 01:57:30.895]  Then back into all this news quickly in the third hour.
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:35.003]  In this hour, I do want to remind you my new film, Matrix of Evil, is out.
[01:57:35.583 --> 01:57:41.168]  Available at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com as well as the great trailer for the film you can go watch.
[01:57:41.749 --> 01:57:42.569]  Order it online.
[01:57:42.649 --> 01:57:42.890]  Get it.
[01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:43.710]  Get it out to people.
[01:57:43.770 --> 01:57:45.252]  Wake this country, this world up.
[01:57:45.812 --> 01:57:47.994]  Or call toll free to get any of my films or books.
[01:57:48.014 --> 01:57:48.755]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:48.775 --> 01:57:51.117]  That's 888-253-3139 to get any of the videos.
[01:58:00.111 --> 01:58:05.033]  Books or audio CDs or cassettes or T-shirts or bumper stickers or deception dollars.
[01:58:05.633 --> 01:58:08.474]  It's all at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:08.554 --> 01:58:12.135]  Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:58:12.355 --> 01:58:17.817]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:58:18.057 --> 01:58:28.841]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as... You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:37.492 --> 01:58:38.132]  Big Brother.
[01:58:38.792 --> 01:58:39.833]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:40.573 --> 01:58:41.653]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:42.313 --> 01:58:43.133]  You want answers?
[01:58:43.913 --> 01:58:44.794]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:44.814 --> 01:58:49.115]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:49.655 --> 01:58:53.756]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:58.237 --> 01:59:03.038]  All right, folks, you're tuned into the third hour of this 3rd of November 2003 Global Transmission.
[01:59:05.769 --> 01:59:09.951]  I'm Alex Jones, dedicated to defending liberty, resisting tyranny.
[01:59:10.512 --> 01:59:14.133]  Do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:59:14.153 --> 01:59:15.214]  We're about to go to your calls.
[01:59:15.234 --> 01:59:19.716]  I'm going to take a lot of calls in this third hour on where do you think things are going in Iraq?
[01:59:20.757 --> 01:59:23.438]  Specifically, how long do you think this government's going to be there?
[01:59:23.998 --> 01:59:27.700]  When do you think the UN's going to come in as the savior to play the part of the good cop?
[01:59:28.021 --> 01:59:30.582]  When they were behind it the whole time, that is their private owners.
[01:59:31.465 --> 01:59:33.386]  What do you think about all these troops dying?
[01:59:33.426 --> 01:59:40.191]  The obvious evidence that hundreds of deaths of troops has been covered up by the media and by the White House.
[01:59:40.311 --> 01:59:42.933]  Why won't they let the media in to see the wounded troops?
[01:59:43.333 --> 01:59:44.934]  Why are they not giving them treatment?
[01:59:45.494 --> 01:59:46.975]  I want to get your response to this.
[01:59:46.995 --> 01:59:51.118]  1-800-259-9231 in this third hour.
[01:59:52.079 --> 01:59:55.301]  Also, before the last hour ended, I started this article out of London Guardian.
[01:59:56.462 --> 01:59:59.384]  Health fear for children sparks fury over fluoride.
[02:00:00.103 --> 02:00:00.463]  We're good to go.
[02:00:00.484 --> 02:00:00.704]  I think?
[02:00:18.849 --> 02:00:23.733]  He said that 10 parts per billion in fluoride in human breast milk, 100 times less than proposed for drinking water.
[02:00:38.863 --> 02:00:45.871]  And that's exactly what the top toxicologist said a few months ago when he was on this show, and that's in the audio section of prisonplanet.com.
[02:00:45.911 --> 02:00:49.095]  You need to take that, email that link to everybody.
[02:00:50.018 --> 02:00:51.538]  Why are they putting it in our water?
[02:00:51.619 --> 02:00:52.639]  We know it's deadly.
[02:00:52.699 --> 02:00:53.919]  It's not debatable.
[02:00:54.399 --> 02:01:06.163]  There are studies from the 20s, the 30s, the 40s, the 50s, the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, right through to today from the University of Texas, the University of Wisconsin, the University of California, every university you can imagine.
[02:01:06.743 --> 02:01:13.225]  They knew about the toxic effects, the dumbing down of fluoride, 80 plus years ago.
[02:01:13.465 --> 02:01:17.906]  It was used in lunatic asylums as a sedative.
[02:01:18.809 --> 02:01:21.532]  They stopped using it because of the toxic nature!
[02:01:23.935 --> 02:01:25.938]  Oh man, it's so out of control.
[02:01:26.098 --> 02:01:29.982]  Stop drinking fluoridated water, people.
[02:01:31.144 --> 02:01:35.369]  Don't let these wicked devils take control of your life.
[02:01:36.693 --> 02:01:42.135]  We'll come back and go to a bunch of calls, and I'm going to get into debate over new link between MMR, jab, and autism.
[02:01:42.175 --> 02:01:45.237]  London Guardian, UK measles outbreak posed risk to the U.S.
[02:01:45.597 --> 02:01:47.698]  because of under-vaccination.
[02:01:47.718 --> 02:01:55.401]  Yeah, they're going to release lots of plagues on us to scare us into taking their deadly shots that are changing our DNA, attacking our children's brains, you name it.
[02:01:57.062 --> 02:02:04.985]  Behind tonight's ABC Jesus special, news team bases report on virulently anti-Christian novel...
[02:02:05.934 --> 02:02:11.157]  Also, nation of TV slackers dimly aware of ignorance is not bliss.
[02:02:11.257 --> 02:02:12.737]  This was a new big poll in England.
[02:02:12.757 --> 02:02:20.641]  The majority of people did not even know who the vice prime minister is in England.
[02:02:21.461 --> 02:02:22.682]  Well, you're a lot better than we are.
[02:02:22.702 --> 02:02:25.203]  The numbers are even higher here!
[02:02:25.223 --> 02:02:30.806]  That is so scary, folks, that an idiot will give you advice...
[02:02:32.143 --> 02:02:35.586]  After the war with Iraq, they still don't know where it is.
[02:02:36.206 --> 02:02:38.628]  People don't know how many continents there are.
[02:02:39.609 --> 02:02:41.150]  They don't know anything.
[02:02:41.210 --> 02:02:42.911]  You know how scary that is, folks?
[02:02:45.092 --> 02:02:47.154]  Also, big story here out of the Sunday Herald.
[02:02:47.274 --> 02:02:53.118]  Five Israelis were seen filming as jetliners plunge into the Twin Towers on September 11th.
[02:02:53.999 --> 02:02:59.063]  Mainstream news reporting what we reported two-plus years ago.
[02:02:59.623 --> 02:03:00.904]  It is not an urban legend.
[02:03:02.926 --> 02:03:05.047]  As many say, it is fact.
[02:03:05.808 --> 02:03:06.528]  We'll go over that.
[02:03:06.628 --> 02:03:09.829]  Justices face decision on accepting 9-11 cases.
[02:03:09.849 --> 02:03:12.631]  Looks like the feds are going to block all the 9-1-1 suits for a lot of them.
[02:03:13.171 --> 02:03:16.132]  Touchscreen voting could present problems for Floridians.
[02:03:16.893 --> 02:03:18.053]  This out of Fox News.
[02:03:18.113 --> 02:03:21.695]  Taiwan orders 8 million livestock RFID tracker chips.
[02:03:23.175 --> 02:03:24.836]  It's all coming up after some calls.
[02:03:24.956 --> 02:03:30.019]  On the other side of this quick break, if you want to know what's really going on, this is the show for you.
[02:03:30.059 --> 02:03:30.739]  We'll be right back.
[02:03:32.864 --> 02:03:37.209]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:03:37.389 --> 02:03:41.793]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:03:41.974 --> 02:03:46.318]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:03:46.378 --> 02:03:47.700]  The New World Order.
[02:03:49.516 --> 02:03:53.718]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:53.798 --> 02:04:00.721]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:04:00.861 --> 02:04:02.882]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:04:03.242 --> 02:04:06.303]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[02:04:06.483 --> 02:04:13.566]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:04:13.847 --> 02:04:19.209]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:04:19.729 --> 02:04:22.370]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[02:04:28.313 --> 02:04:31.834]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:04:32.194 --> 02:04:33.014]  Oh my God!
[02:04:33.294 --> 02:04:38.016]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:04:38.256 --> 02:04:41.917]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[02:04:43.497 --> 02:04:44.317]  This is Pat Cooper.
[02:04:44.357 --> 02:04:46.798]  Tony Del Vecchio is coming to this station very soon.
[02:04:46.858 --> 02:04:47.418]  I'm sweet.
[02:04:47.458 --> 02:04:48.619]  I'd book any day now.
[02:04:48.659 --> 02:04:50.119]  You're going to love his show.
[02:04:51.852 --> 02:04:57.036]  That's all about this with your host, Tony DelVecchio, Saturday evenings from 9 to 10 p.m.
[02:04:57.076 --> 02:05:00.318]  Central Time, right here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:05:01.858 --> 02:05:02.839]  or call the National Line at 877-996-4327.
[02:05:32.003 --> 02:05:33.643]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:05:33.663 --> 02:05:36.184]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:06:00.109 --> 02:06:01.830]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[02:06:02.091 --> 02:06:14.040]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:20.805]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[02:06:21.005 --> 02:06:24.167]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:06:28.931 --> 02:06:29.952]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:06:29.972 --> 02:06:30.332]  All right, folks.
[02:06:57.987 --> 02:07:00.968]  Already 8 minutes and 30 seconds into the third hour.
[02:07:03.268 --> 02:07:04.509]  I'm desperate to warn you.
[02:07:04.529 --> 02:07:17.472]  I'm desperate to get you thinking outside the box, to get you to think for yourself, to look around you at the massive admitted level of government involvement in the media, lying and planning false news stories and trying to take our liberties away.
[02:07:17.492 --> 02:07:20.133]  I heard a local talk station this weekend...
[02:07:21.443 --> 02:07:26.264]  Going, oh, look how good we did with the media exposing the Total Information Awareness Network.
[02:07:26.764 --> 02:07:27.564]  It's defeated.
[02:07:27.624 --> 02:07:28.805]  It's gone now.
[02:07:29.645 --> 02:07:30.365]  No, it's not.
[02:07:30.425 --> 02:07:31.625]  It's called Echelon.
[02:07:32.065 --> 02:07:34.226]  It's called the Matrix System at the state level.
[02:07:34.666 --> 02:07:37.407]  It's called Our Lady of Peace Act, the new gun bill.
[02:07:38.047 --> 02:07:47.229]  And they changed the name of that again to Strengthening the Instant Background Check System for the national database of everyone and all your private info in a gun control bill.
[02:07:48.456 --> 02:07:55.398]  It's the National Security Agency running it with your local police departments with liaisons from the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:07:56.538 --> 02:07:58.479]  But again, you believe the propaganda.
[02:07:58.519 --> 02:07:59.459]  You have a victory.
[02:07:59.739 --> 02:08:00.819]  You go back to sleep.
[02:08:00.919 --> 02:08:02.140]  And that is not the case.
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:05.961]  And no, we haven't had the final victory over the Patriot Act.
[02:08:06.261 --> 02:08:11.983]  They're still implementing it, despite the fact that over 400 cities and now four states have thrown it out.
[02:08:12.783 --> 02:08:17.104]  We've got to continue to have victories, continue to push the Bill of Rights culture.
[02:08:17.717 --> 02:08:18.177]  We're good to go.
[02:08:43.829 --> 02:08:44.909]  You know, I was shocked.
[02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:55.513]  Last Friday on NBC Evening News, they actually ran a segment that they're having problems with desertion with soldiers coming back from Iraq on leave.
[02:08:55.953 --> 02:08:57.333]  They'll take a plane to the U.S.
[02:08:57.433 --> 02:08:58.954]  on leave, and they just won't go back.
[02:08:58.994 --> 02:08:59.834]  They'll disappear.
[02:09:00.054 --> 02:09:02.355]  Well, we reported this three months ago.
[02:09:02.915 --> 02:09:12.298]  They're going AWOL en masse and walking or driving into places like Kuwait or Saudi Arabia and disappearing.
[02:09:13.666 --> 02:09:19.656]  Yeah, that is, I think, going to be the next problem they're going to have to address.
[02:09:19.716 --> 02:09:24.124]  And I'm wondering, do you think they actually will institute the draft?
[02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:26.709]  Well, they already have.
[02:09:26.789 --> 02:09:32.211]  You see, if you've signed on for military service for two years, four years, ten years, you're out.
[02:09:32.651 --> 02:09:39.473]  There was a clause in the contracts they signed that said we can call you up indefinitely if you've ever been in the military.
[02:09:39.833 --> 02:09:41.914]  So they're already doing that and that is a draft.
[02:09:41.974 --> 02:09:43.114]  That is not voluntary.
[02:09:43.534 --> 02:09:48.776]  Now, they got about six different bills in the Senate, five different bills in the House.
[02:09:50.386 --> 02:10:04.377]  18 to 26, 18 to 49, they've got bills for all the professionals, medical workers, firefighters, police, engineers, psychiatrists, morticians, anybody they want.
[02:10:04.798 --> 02:10:16.948]  Truck drivers, that was in the Houston Chronicle about two months ago, the new bill that's bipartisan, and they say, well, everyone in the country, 18 to 49, is going to be a conscript, but
[02:10:17.695 --> 02:10:27.907]  Most of you, 80% of us, are going to be here domestically serving in the new Homeland Security Defense Force.
[02:10:28.007 --> 02:10:32.592]  And to graduate from high school, there's another bill where you'll have to serve two years there.
[02:10:34.102 --> 02:10:35.603]  When you're a junior and a senior.
[02:10:35.723 --> 02:10:47.128]  And, buddy, I've seen, Clayton, the training manuals, the websites, what Secure Corps, subdivision of AmeriCorps, another sub-directorate of TIPS is doing.
[02:10:47.508 --> 02:10:58.832]  It's training 16-year-olds with M-16s, warrant service, fugitive apprehension, checkpoint operation, literal Hitler, UGAN.
[02:10:59.233 --> 02:11:00.353]  What do you say to them apples?
[02:11:01.113 --> 02:11:02.454]  You know, I heard a story...
[02:11:03.378 --> 02:11:13.601]  Over the weekend that they're actually training these young recruits watching video games to break down their resistance to kill people when they send them over to Iraq.
[02:11:13.661 --> 02:11:15.222]  Now, that's absolute fact.
[02:11:15.242 --> 02:11:16.322]  That's 20 years old.
[02:11:16.842 --> 02:11:30.786]  The original games, like Doom, that's about 10 years old, were developed because they found in Vietnam about half the soldiers, if somebody was up close, including Vietnamese, wouldn't have the killer instinct to pull the trigger.
[02:11:32.367 --> 02:11:32.647]  Okay?
[02:11:33.263 --> 02:11:34.844]  Just because they weren't raised around that.
[02:11:34.884 --> 02:11:46.230]  They would generally recruit from the West or the South because you did have more of a killer instinct for some reason when people in the South or the West, a lot more practice with guns, pulling the trigger, a willingness to do it.
[02:11:46.810 --> 02:11:51.072]  That's why the backbone of the military front-line troops was folks from rural areas.
[02:11:51.653 --> 02:11:54.834]  So they introduced these video games where you shoot and kill people.
[02:11:54.894 --> 02:12:01.238]  Now they're very violent, and now they're going to control drone aircraft, drone tanks, drone robots...
[02:12:02.058 --> 02:12:16.948]  And you're literally going to have somebody in a compound, an armored office building in Washington, D.C., or Colorado Springs, or Austin, Texas, controlling drones, small robot remote-controlled tanks.
[02:12:17.248 --> 02:12:18.349]  This has all been in the news.
[02:12:18.829 --> 02:12:20.650]  So the new G.I.
[02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:29.436]  Joe toys are all SWAT team commanders who, quote, fight Cobra, and Cobra is a terrorist who's into gun rights.
[02:12:30.216 --> 02:12:30.917]  This is out there.
[02:12:31.697 --> 02:12:35.900]  Right, that's why we're seeing an explosion of these killers in our schools and
[02:12:55.725 --> 02:12:57.206]  Serial killers and all that.
[02:12:57.866 --> 02:13:02.088]  These people were growing up on these videos and these violent movies like Terminator.
[02:13:02.468 --> 02:13:03.489]  One thing I'll let you go, Alex.
[02:13:03.749 --> 02:13:04.649]  I got your tape.
[02:13:05.049 --> 02:13:06.810]  Police say three total enslavement.
[02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:09.731]  Outstanding, and I'll be ordering your next one.
[02:13:09.871 --> 02:13:10.752]  What's it, Matrix?
[02:13:11.472 --> 02:13:12.413]  Matrix of Evil.
[02:13:12.633 --> 02:13:13.713]  Yeah, I'll be getting that one.
[02:13:14.133 --> 02:13:15.174]  Keep up the great work, Alex.
[02:13:15.394 --> 02:13:16.354]  Hey, thanks a lot.
[02:13:16.514 --> 02:13:17.995]  And folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:13:19.496 --> 02:13:22.357]  I could spend calmly the next hour
[02:13:23.032 --> 02:13:28.855]  I intend to go to a toy store with a small video camera, calmly go about my business videotaping this because I cannot continue to purchase it.
[02:13:29.456 --> 02:13:31.817]  I have a closet that is half full of toys.
[02:13:33.578 --> 02:13:34.078]  I'm serious.
[02:13:35.919 --> 02:13:42.803]  $40 Lego sets where the police have hateful looks on their faces and drive a global surveillance truck that looks through walls.
[02:13:44.378 --> 02:13:45.939]  Everything is spy police.
[02:13:45.999 --> 02:13:48.561]  Everything is how to torture people.
[02:13:48.641 --> 02:13:51.384]  Everything is about how to spy on your parents.
[02:13:51.504 --> 02:13:56.508]  And I just keep buying all this junk, planning to put it in a film in the future, a segment in a film.
[02:13:57.889 --> 02:13:58.650]  I can't afford it.
[02:13:58.670 --> 02:14:02.673]  I think I'm just going to sneak into the stores with a video camera and videotape all these toys.
[02:14:03.534 --> 02:14:09.459]  Half of the boys' toys for little men, young men, is New World Order.
[02:14:13.326 --> 02:14:17.772]  And the girls' toys, most of it is witchcraft or how to be a whore.
[02:14:18.794 --> 02:14:21.377]  You know, Barbie dressed up in garter belts.
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:25.403]  You ought to see the young girls' clothes.
[02:14:25.823 --> 02:14:28.127]  For the young boys, it's gang member apparel.
[02:14:29.102 --> 02:14:31.383]  I mean, it's just an absolute warping.
[02:14:31.403 --> 02:14:36.386]  They've got all these TV shows, dramas where the homeschoolers are bad.
[02:14:37.006 --> 02:14:40.949]  They've got shows where they have to take the homeschoolers' families.
[02:14:41.929 --> 02:14:42.329]  J.C.
[02:14:42.389 --> 02:14:48.052]  Penney sells a shirt that says homeschooled with school spelled wrong with a picture of a trailer.
[02:14:48.733 --> 02:14:49.473]  It's everywhere.
[02:14:49.513 --> 02:14:50.994]  It's a total onslaught.
[02:14:53.095 --> 02:14:54.116]  It's everything.
[02:14:55.377 --> 02:14:56.177]  It's everything.
[02:14:58.208 --> 02:15:03.410]  The new soldier toys across the board say SWAT, and they're wearing black ski masks.
[02:15:05.251 --> 02:15:13.014]  I remember one time I turned on cartoons, and there was Captain Planet that was produced by Ted Turner, and I thought it was just that one episode.
[02:15:13.054 --> 02:15:24.519]  The evil mastermind wears a three-cornered hat, and he's called the Patriot, and he runs around dumping toxic waste everywhere, and he's into the Second Amendment.
[02:15:25.262 --> 02:15:33.449]  And he runs around wearing blue and red continental colors and dumping toxic waste in the ocean.
[02:15:34.510 --> 02:15:36.011]  And he carries a blunderbust.
[02:15:36.852 --> 02:15:39.314]  I mean, folks, I don't watch TV.
[02:15:39.414 --> 02:15:40.194]  I turn it on.
[02:15:40.635 --> 02:15:43.577]  And the new Fantastic Four, I've seen a couple episodes of that.
[02:15:44.118 --> 02:15:49.202]  Every episode, the UN is defending against space alien attacks or right-wing attacks.
[02:15:50.637 --> 02:16:05.125]  Or in one episode, it's this group of monks who are Christians who wear hoods, who are really demons, and the Fantastic Four have to defeat the Christians, and everything is United Nations, and come on, folks!
[02:16:06.165 --> 02:16:07.886]  Let's talk to Alan in Texas.
[02:16:08.006 --> 02:16:08.867]  Alan, you're on the air.
[02:16:08.887 --> 02:16:09.927]  Hello.
[02:16:10.448 --> 02:16:10.788]  Welcome.
[02:16:10.808 --> 02:16:11.568]  How are you doing?
[02:16:11.808 --> 02:16:12.269]  Pretty good.
[02:16:12.749 --> 02:16:13.029]  Good.
[02:16:13.849 --> 02:16:15.770]  Glad to be able to get through to talk to you.
[02:16:15.790 --> 02:16:16.871]  Hello.
[02:16:17.444 --> 02:16:22.405]  I was listening to a show last night, an Art Bell show.
[02:16:23.225 --> 02:16:25.726]  It aired for about four hours last night.
[02:16:25.826 --> 02:16:27.426]  He was talking to John Lear.
[02:16:28.306 --> 02:16:33.067]  You've been talking about the things going on with aliens and 9-11.
[02:16:35.328 --> 02:16:45.170]  He constantly repeated himself talking about 9-11 that the people in the world will never know in a million years.
[02:16:45.754 --> 02:16:47.095]  What happened at 9-11?
[02:16:47.355 --> 02:16:47.655]  Never.
[02:16:47.975 --> 02:16:48.196]  No.
[02:16:48.816 --> 02:16:51.377]  They said that these people trained for years for this.
[02:16:52.118 --> 02:16:57.621]  John Lear is the designer and pilot of Lear Jets.
[02:16:58.622 --> 02:17:10.449]  And he said that these people were trained to fly at, you know, 600 mile an hour into objects, you know, without overshooting them.
[02:17:11.175 --> 02:17:13.677]  And guiding them straight into the towers and all that.
[02:17:14.017 --> 02:17:14.637]  Let me stop you.
[02:17:14.657 --> 02:17:16.619]  You know, I don't talk about space aliens.
[02:17:17.219 --> 02:17:18.620]  Yeah.
[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:30.347]  And that entire broadcast by Clear Channel is for every ten stories about chupacabras and aliens, they'll put one real story in there and the whole thing is discredited.
[02:17:31.148 --> 02:17:36.151]  But, sir, the official story of 9-11 is impossible.
[02:17:36.551 --> 02:17:38.693]  Most of the hijackers have been found alive.
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:39.800]  Yes.
[02:17:39.820 --> 02:17:42.021]  Do you have any comments to that?
[02:17:42.041 --> 02:17:43.762]  Well, I understand what you're saying.
[02:17:43.782 --> 02:17:46.763]  There's so many versions and so many ways of people to listen.
[02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:09.611]  Well, I've got to hear more about this.

[02:21:27.367 --> 02:21:29.349]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[02:21:30.850 --> 02:21:37.074]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:21:37.515 --> 02:21:45.301]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:45.641 --> 02:21:51.225]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[02:21:51.505 --> 02:21:52.186]  We're good to go.
[02:22:18.943 --> 02:22:19.564]  All right, Alan.
[02:22:19.604 --> 02:22:22.166]  You were bringing up a show that you heard last night with Art Bell.
[02:22:22.186 --> 02:22:22.406]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:47.663 --> 02:22:54.466]  And, you know, I didn't hear it, but from what you said, you talked about how we'll never know what really happened and how these guys were trained to do this.
[02:22:54.867 --> 02:22:55.027]  Yes.
[02:22:55.087 --> 02:22:57.668]  I mean, that sounds like garbage to me, but I didn't hear the show.
[02:22:57.728 --> 02:23:01.790]  Now you're saying that the guy was saying that there's some type of cover-up or something's going on.
[02:23:02.310 --> 02:23:03.091]  Exactly, yes.
[02:23:03.131 --> 02:23:04.251]  They're covering it up.
[02:23:05.612 --> 02:23:16.157]  The government, they do these things to distract people, but the distraction is he was talking about aliens.
[02:23:16.716 --> 02:23:18.157]  Spaceships, aliens.
[02:23:18.737 --> 02:23:24.200]  He said that humans and cattle and everything are the components.
[02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:28.302]  He called them components for a soul for aliens to steal.
[02:23:28.742 --> 02:23:33.244]  That's why you find dead cattle out in fields with the blood and everything.
[02:23:33.305 --> 02:23:35.386]  And the inventor of the Learjet was saying this?
[02:23:35.506 --> 02:23:36.346]  Yes, yes, sir.
[02:23:36.826 --> 02:23:37.046]  Yeah.
[02:23:38.647 --> 02:23:39.948]  Okay, well, thanks for the call.
[02:23:40.228 --> 02:23:41.409]  You know, I've got to tell you something.
[02:23:41.469 --> 02:23:42.629]  I deal with legislation.
[02:23:42.649 --> 02:23:43.490]  I deal with...
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:50.704]  With things that are happening, I deal with a rocket-propelled grenade hitting a Chinook helicopter yesterday.
[02:23:51.785 --> 02:23:53.647]  And that is so classic.
[02:23:53.767 --> 02:23:55.388]  Mixing space aliens in with 9-11.
[02:23:55.468 --> 02:24:06.116]  I'm not saying it's a distraction for the economy or a distraction for world government or an excuse to get a police state in place, but it's so the chupacabras can come drink our blood.
[02:24:06.236 --> 02:24:09.979]  I mean, just, you know... And then so many people come up to me.
[02:24:10.099 --> 02:24:11.600]  Oh, Planet X is going to get us.
[02:24:11.941 --> 02:24:12.001]  Oh...
[02:24:13.048 --> 02:24:14.768]  Atlantis is about to rise.
[02:24:14.828 --> 02:24:21.310]  The end of the world in 2012 or in 2012 because of the end of the Aztec calendar.
[02:24:22.410 --> 02:24:24.890]  Folks, I don't talk about it here on this show.
[02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.871]  Do not do it.
[02:24:26.431 --> 02:24:30.592]  Did you know the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation funds Mr. Sitchin?
[02:24:32.212 --> 02:24:42.494]  Did you know that the Rothschilds, according to the Kansas City Star and the New York Times, are funding the Sci-Fi Channel in this search for extraterrestrial life and are pushing it as a New Age religion?
[02:24:43.083 --> 02:24:46.885]  You know, there's a government program to have a fake alien invasion.
[02:24:47.485 --> 02:24:48.526]  This is all being done.
[02:24:48.546 --> 02:24:52.348]  I'm not saying there aren't aliens, folks, but I don't deal with stuff I can't prove.
[02:24:52.548 --> 02:24:54.829]  And I know the government's involved in this up to their eyeballs.
[02:24:57.330 --> 02:25:03.033]  And I can get lots of people to sit around and giggle on the street corner with me about green men and how I should talk about it.
[02:25:03.273 --> 02:25:03.853]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:04.093 --> 02:25:11.697]  There's plenty of big, giant radio stations that the establishment wants you to hear that'll do that type of stuff.
[02:25:12.364 --> 02:25:13.785]  We're not going to do that on this show.
[02:25:14.705 --> 02:25:16.706]  Let's talk to Ron in Oklahoma.
[02:25:16.786 --> 02:25:17.646]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:25:17.706 --> 02:25:18.127]  Go ahead.
[02:25:18.387 --> 02:25:26.531]  Alex, you reckon we get those guys to explain to us how the firemen found molten steel at the bottom of the Trade Center six to eight weeks after 9-11?
[02:25:26.671 --> 02:25:30.372]  Oh, why did Building 7 collapse faster than a bowling ball can fall?
[02:25:30.732 --> 02:25:34.174]  Anybody that's ever used a welding torch knows how hard it is to melt steel.
[02:25:34.194 --> 02:25:40.497]  And it's just unbelievable that you could have molten steel six to eight weeks later, even at the bottom of that rubble.
[02:25:41.533 --> 02:25:52.517]  But also, Alex, I sent you an article several weeks ago, an interview with a World War II vet who was going to a reunion at Clinton Sherman Air Base here in Oklahoma.
[02:25:53.337 --> 02:26:08.882]  He had, during World War II, he had served with a top-secret Navy unit, and their job, they worked with remote-controlled bombers, which he said even had TV cameras.
[02:26:09.639 --> 02:26:10.699]  Well, Joseph Kennedy Jr.
[02:26:10.759 --> 02:26:13.700]  died piloting in a B-23 Liberator full of explosives.
[02:26:29.645 --> 02:26:30.025]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:26:30.065 --> 02:26:30.586]  Anything else?
[02:26:30.606 --> 02:26:30.926]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:26:30.966 --> 02:26:33.149]  Also, you were talking about Joe and Johnny Sixpack.
[02:26:33.169 --> 02:26:35.291]  We've got that same problem here in Oklahoma.
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:27:00.121]  Oklahoma's probably the only state in the country where the English teachers teach I before E except after Budweiser.
[02:27:01.082 --> 02:27:05.022]  But this is, you know, it's really bad.
[02:27:05.042 --> 02:27:19.506]  Our main state's newspaper, the Daily Oklahoman here in Oklahoma City, was recently reformatted, cut down in size at least 33%, more whiteface, more sports, more TV guides, more fluff.
[02:27:19.546 --> 02:27:21.646]  I think they must have hired Larry King to redesign it.
[02:27:23.297 --> 02:27:25.979]  Everything is shifting over to mindlessness.
[02:27:27.961 --> 02:27:29.502]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[02:27:29.542 --> 02:27:31.584]  No, no, it's just a newspaper 100 years ago.
[02:27:31.904 --> 02:27:34.526]  The words are so big and complex, I can't read them.
[02:27:35.667 --> 02:27:43.073]  I mean, I'm stupid compared to somebody 100 years ago, but we think we're so smart today reading stuff at a 5th grade level in these newspapers.
[02:27:43.934 --> 02:27:47.336]  Well, the Oklahoma now, the new Oklahoma, I don't think is at a 5th grade level.
[02:27:47.356 --> 02:27:48.097]  It's even that high.
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:51.801]  Like I said, they've redesigned it and dumbed it down.
[02:27:51.821 --> 02:27:58.303]  I don't know whether it's an attempt to dumb down the people or the result of the fact they already have dumbed it down.
[02:27:58.463 --> 02:28:00.424]  Hey, what do you think of all these dead troops?
[02:28:01.364 --> 02:28:06.446]  Alex, it seems to me, I mean, I saw William Crystal on Nightline here last spring.
[02:28:06.466 --> 02:28:06.806]  Stay there.
[02:28:06.826 --> 02:28:07.806]  I'm going to let you finish up.
[02:28:07.826 --> 02:28:12.948]  I'm going to talk to Ed and John, and that's it for calls because I've got to get into some more of this important news.
[02:28:13.892 --> 02:28:15.634]  Ron, Ed, and John, that's it for calls.
[02:28:15.674 --> 02:28:16.415]  Sorry to other folks.
[02:28:16.955 --> 02:28:17.576]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:17.596 --> 02:28:18.637]  We've got 30 minutes left.
[02:28:18.697 --> 02:28:19.958]  Infowars.com.
[02:28:23.442 --> 02:28:24.343]  We're on the march.
[02:28:24.843 --> 02:28:26.445]  The empire's on the run.
[02:28:27.366 --> 02:28:30.088]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:34.324 --> 02:28:34.725]  We're good to go.
[02:28:50.388 --> 02:28:50.949]  We're good to go.
[02:29:07.668 --> 02:29:10.589]  4327 extension 106 for quotes or more information.
[02:29:10.869 --> 02:29:15.190]  That number again is 877-996-4327 extension 106.
[02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:17.070]  Everyone listens to radio.
[02:29:17.390 --> 02:29:19.871]  It's the most cost-effective way to increase business available.
[02:29:20.231 --> 02:29:22.152]  Don't wait around hoping for a stronger economy.
[02:29:22.352 --> 02:29:25.452]  The country might be slipping into recession, but your business doesn't have to.
[02:29:25.832 --> 02:29:28.193]  Call GCN today and get more customers tomorrow.
[02:29:32.443 --> 02:29:35.926]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:29:36.186 --> 02:29:39.709]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[02:29:50.537 --> 02:29:58.443]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:29:58.843 --> 02:30:04.187]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.

[02:30:31.488 --> 02:30:31.988]  Hey, everybody.
[02:30:32.028 --> 02:30:33.788]  Let me talk to you about your weight for a minute.
[02:30:33.849 --> 02:30:36.449]  How many of you have tried the fad diets?
[02:30:36.629 --> 02:30:37.769]  You've tried the pills.
[02:30:37.789 --> 02:30:39.230]  You've tried counting calories.
[02:30:39.450 --> 02:30:43.711]  You've even tried other nighttime weight loss formulas, and nothing seems to be working.
[02:30:43.991 --> 02:30:44.971]  You know what I suggest to you?
[02:30:45.371 --> 02:30:51.032]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:30:51.172 --> 02:30:59.754]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN, and they have people standing by to answer your questions about how to lose weight the safe and healthy way.

[02:31:07.798 --> 02:31:09.079]  This is the real deal, folks.
[02:31:09.119 --> 02:31:11.740]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:12.880]  And it's healthy for you, too.

[02:31:22.905 --> 02:31:23.146]  1-800-622-THIN.
[02:31:23.166 --> 02:31:23.386]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[02:31:38.155 --> 02:31:40.076]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:31:40.556 --> 02:31:43.397]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:44.958 --> 02:31:45.618]  All right, my friends.
[02:31:45.638 --> 02:31:47.439]  Three final calls and a ton of news.
[02:31:48.319 --> 02:31:51.500]  I just want to go over the front of the statesman today.
[02:31:51.740 --> 02:31:53.221]  Cowboys top Redskins.
[02:31:53.261 --> 02:31:54.462]  That's the most important thing.
[02:31:55.122 --> 02:31:59.584]  Secondarily, horns running wild with Vince Young leading the way.
[02:31:59.724 --> 02:32:01.784]  UT rises number 11 in pole.
[02:32:02.004 --> 02:32:03.085]  Oh, that's so important.
[02:32:04.378 --> 02:32:06.819]  Free is the key for wireless Internet users.
[02:32:06.899 --> 02:32:10.679]  Then another article, a boom for businesses may bedevil neighbors.
[02:32:11.640 --> 02:32:16.180]  Then it says, copter attack in Iraq killed 16, deadliest strike against U.S.
[02:32:17.741 --> 02:32:19.641]  Soldiers were departing for leave.
[02:32:19.701 --> 02:32:22.622]  Under that, Halloween party became a nightmare.
[02:32:23.662 --> 02:32:28.543]  Dustin McManus, Bowie High teenager, charged with aggravated assault and stabbing.
[02:32:29.491 --> 02:32:36.015]  He stabbed seven different people viciously with a butcher knife running around psychotically.
[02:32:36.035 --> 02:32:39.897]  They described it as a frenzied demon.
[02:32:40.697 --> 02:32:42.838]  The answer is ban all knives immediately.
[02:32:43.279 --> 02:32:46.841]  Under that, coming this week, Vicente Fox comes to town.
[02:32:48.181 --> 02:32:58.207]  And it says this week they'll be discussing what's on the menu at the governor's mansion and also what's on the political agenda, open borders and legalization of illegals.
[02:32:59.878 --> 02:33:06.528]  They actually say, though, before they get into immigration, they talk about what's going to be on the dinner menu.
[02:33:06.728 --> 02:33:09.553]  Very important, very detailed in this article.
[02:33:10.713 --> 02:33:11.614]  In fact, let me just read it.
[02:33:11.654 --> 02:33:13.714]  It says, Vicente Fox comes to town.
[02:33:13.795 --> 02:33:16.015]  Mexico's president visits Austin on Wednesday.
[02:33:16.436 --> 02:33:25.200]  Our coverage through the week will include a preview of his agenda, a look at the governor's mansion menu, and a report on the trip's results.
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:26.600]  Isn't that nice?
[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:28.081]  And here's another one on the front page.
[02:33:28.641 --> 02:33:31.802]  Episcopalians install openly gay bishop.
[02:33:32.683 --> 02:33:34.163]  Don't use the word homosexual.
[02:33:34.243 --> 02:33:35.024]  That's hateful.
[02:33:35.977 --> 02:33:38.799]  You will be arrested by Scotland Yard Diversity Unit.
[02:33:39.140 --> 02:33:45.104]  According to the BBC, if you use the word homosexual, that's now a hate word, a scientific word, like heterosexual.
[02:33:45.765 --> 02:33:51.809]  And on top of that, our Supreme Court says they're going to follow the rulings of Europe now, so we'll be under that.
[02:33:51.869 --> 02:33:53.811]  And notice the newspaper's playing ball.
[02:33:55.592 --> 02:33:57.253]  Ron, go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[02:33:57.293 --> 02:33:57.693]  Go ahead.
[02:33:57.713 --> 02:34:01.116]  Yeah, Alex, how could you leave out OSU football games?
[02:34:01.877 --> 02:34:04.999]  But anyway, seriously, last spring I saw...
[02:34:05.734 --> 02:34:18.400]  William Crystal, one of Bush's top advisors on Nightline, he was saying that back about 96, 97, him, Cheney, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, a group he called the Saturday Standard.
[02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:20.360]  Yeah, they founded PNAC.
[02:34:20.741 --> 02:34:20.981]  Right.
[02:34:21.521 --> 02:34:25.062]  They had laid out the plan for regime changers in about 60 countries.
[02:34:26.758 --> 02:34:29.199]  And this is the script they're reading off of right now.
[02:34:29.279 --> 02:34:35.863]  Yeah, there's 63 countries on the hit list, according to the first PNAC documents, out of that Saturday meeting in 1997.
[02:34:37.083 --> 02:34:41.766]  Right, and you were asking what I thought about the troops being killed in Iraq.
[02:34:42.006 --> 02:34:54.052]  It seems to me that if you don't have troops killed in Iraq, bombings, attacks, rocket attacks, whatever, then you don't have an excuse...
[02:34:54.522 --> 02:34:58.164]  Well, that's it.
[02:34:58.685 --> 02:35:17.336]  Well, yeah, they're saying that Iran and Syria are now behind this, and Rumsfeld's own group, P2OG, formed two years ago, this is admitted, said, We want to attack people to get them to attack us, so we have a pretext for global domination.
[02:35:17.716 --> 02:35:20.318]  Looks to me like they're reading from a Hollywood script.
[02:35:21.221 --> 02:35:21.982]  It is a script.
[02:35:22.022 --> 02:35:23.263]  The whole thing's scripted out.
[02:35:23.323 --> 02:35:27.206]  But again, America will be the bad cop going into country after country.
[02:35:27.246 --> 02:35:31.050]  We'll then pull out, and the UN will come in and love everyone.
[02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:32.571]  Love them to death, huh?
[02:35:32.851 --> 02:35:33.532]  Yeah, love them to death.
[02:35:33.572 --> 02:35:40.298]  Well, look, when they ordered our troops all over Iraq, this is admitted, and they have generals on record saying, yeah, we're doing it.
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:52.247]  If somebody even shoots at our troops, they go in and bulldoze everyone's date palms, everyone's olive trees, everyone's tangerine trees, lemon trees.
[02:35:52.788 --> 02:35:56.450]  They go into the poorest areas and bulldoze thousands of acres.
[02:35:57.031 --> 02:36:00.933]  Now, believe me, folks, that's only going to get more resistance going.
[02:36:01.554 --> 02:36:02.494]  And they know that.
[02:36:02.595 --> 02:36:03.595]  They understand that.
[02:36:04.776 --> 02:36:10.380]  Well, Alex, the CIA is known for creating incidents to cause a reaction, cause and effect.
[02:36:11.277 --> 02:36:17.439]  Well, I want to know what you'd do if the Russians were here because we had weapons of mass destruction and we had to be taken over because, you know, the U.N.
[02:36:17.479 --> 02:36:18.459]  and NATO said so.
[02:36:18.479 --> 02:36:19.739]  And they said this is part of the plan.
[02:36:19.779 --> 02:36:25.021]  And the Czech troops, you know, raped your wife and beat you up and cut down your fruit trees.
[02:36:25.321 --> 02:36:26.541]  Would you love them then?
[02:36:26.561 --> 02:36:29.082]  Oh, not hardly.
[02:36:29.622 --> 02:36:32.143]  There would be mass resistance in this country.
[02:36:32.383 --> 02:36:36.444]  One thing about Joe Sixpack, he dragged out his six-gun, his shotgun, and his Winchester.
[02:36:37.102 --> 02:36:38.503]  And it could be interesting then.
[02:36:38.523 --> 02:36:40.324]  But I'll tell you what the news would say.
[02:36:40.644 --> 02:36:43.085]  The news would be broadcasting terrorists are striking.
[02:36:43.625 --> 02:36:45.246]  Evil terrorists are fighting back.
[02:36:45.286 --> 02:36:45.926]  How dare them?
[02:36:46.207 --> 02:37:00.674]  Yeah, I know, but there are enough, at least in the South, enough of these redneck Joe Sixpacks still have their guns as long as the American Rifle Association doesn't sell them all out and have all their guns confiscated.
[02:37:01.485 --> 02:37:04.407]  Hopefully there'll be a few left when that time rolls around.
[02:37:04.427 --> 02:37:05.007]  I hear you, Ron.
[02:37:05.027 --> 02:37:05.728]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:05.748 --> 02:37:07.129]  Let's talk to Ed in Pennsylvania.
[02:37:07.329 --> 02:37:07.909]  Ed, go ahead.
[02:37:07.929 --> 02:37:12.292]  I want to ask you something.
[02:37:12.352 --> 02:37:30.964]  I listen to you all the time, and I hear about your tapes and everything, and it's great, and you talk about New World Order, and you talk about Illuminati, this whole thing about world domination and everything, but is there any way that we can come to this conclusion where we can have a leader that can stand up and say, listen,
[02:37:31.974 --> 02:37:33.575]  We're going about it all the wrong way.
[02:37:33.935 --> 02:37:35.396]  We need to be fiscally sound.
[02:37:35.796 --> 02:37:46.582]  We need to have an army that's here, an armed force that's here, that's in America, not all over the world, and just come back to some rational, sensible conclusion.
[02:37:47.463 --> 02:37:49.504]  And it seems as though they're all not doing it.
[02:37:49.524 --> 02:37:51.145]  They're all talking about other things.
[02:37:51.545 --> 02:37:52.946]  I don't hear nothing about Iraq.
[02:37:53.406 --> 02:37:55.547]  I don't hear these counties talking about that.
[02:37:55.567 --> 02:37:57.248]  These are our servants.
[02:37:57.368 --> 02:37:59.109]  These are our civil servants.
[02:37:59.309 --> 02:38:00.210]  Let me respond to that.
[02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:03.011]  Because your question's a huge one.
[02:38:03.051 --> 02:38:04.452]  We could talk for 10 hours about it.
[02:38:04.512 --> 02:38:07.875]  But look, number one, the media sets the agenda.
[02:38:08.375 --> 02:38:10.817]  They give attention to what they want to give attention to.
[02:38:10.837 --> 02:38:20.245]  And until we start ignoring that and going to the heart of the bedrock issues of liberty and freedom and sovereignty and heritage and God, number one, we're going nowhere.
[02:38:20.265 --> 02:38:21.065]  Exactly.
[02:38:21.806 --> 02:38:22.627]  Let me answer your question.
[02:38:22.647 --> 02:38:23.547]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:23.968 --> 02:38:25.249]  They set the agenda.
[02:38:25.509 --> 02:38:27.891]  They put Wesley Clark and George W.,
[02:38:28.852 --> 02:38:29.833]  Out there in front of you.
[02:38:29.913 --> 02:38:35.200]  They put the John Careys and the Liebermans out there in front of you, and they set the agenda.
[02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:43.631]  You can forget some magic leader standing up who's going to fix all your problems because they control who you even know about, sir.
[02:38:43.711 --> 02:38:44.953]  They control who they put.
[02:38:45.653 --> 02:38:46.633]  On the nightly news.
[02:38:46.694 --> 02:38:47.834]  That's number one.
[02:38:48.234 --> 02:38:53.136]  Number two, if we go with a model of having one leader, they can decapitate them.
[02:38:53.536 --> 02:38:55.136]  They can kill them.
[02:38:55.196 --> 02:39:03.499]  But if you have millions of leaders, millions of activists out-educating others, we are unstoppable.
[02:39:03.519 --> 02:39:06.860]  That's the special forces model of force multiplication.
[02:39:06.900 --> 02:39:08.301]  That's what we're all about here.
[02:39:08.721 --> 02:39:16.649]  Well, I hope that happens, Alex, and I really appreciate your getting the word out there, especially on shortwave, because that's what I listen to you on because I'm way out here in Pennsylvania.
[02:39:17.089 --> 02:39:23.716]  But what I hear is when you bring up someone, like let's say I bring up LaRouche, right?
[02:39:23.756 --> 02:39:30.162]  I bring up LaRouche, and the first thing, like I called this one girl, I was talking to this woman today, and we were saying, well, I just listened to a speech that he just did.
[02:39:30.615 --> 02:39:32.435]  And it sounded pretty convincing.
[02:39:32.495 --> 02:39:36.496]  I mean, it sounded like he had some pretty fresh ideas and he talked about history.
[02:39:36.896 --> 02:39:39.517]  But the first thing that came out of her mouth was, oh, he's a wacko.
[02:39:39.577 --> 02:39:40.157]  He's not.
[02:39:41.017 --> 02:39:42.238]  He's kind of weird and all that.
[02:39:42.258 --> 02:39:43.878]  Well, he's not weird.
[02:39:43.938 --> 02:39:45.278]  He's very intelligent.
[02:39:45.298 --> 02:39:46.639]  He has like 170 IQ.
[02:39:46.699 --> 02:39:47.619]  Here's the problem.
[02:39:48.479 --> 02:39:52.860]  LaRouche talks about the big bankers, talks about the Rothschilds, talks about the New World Order.
[02:39:53.260 --> 02:39:56.381]  He stops there and says big government's the answer to that.
[02:39:57.430 --> 02:40:00.393]  And, again, he's more pushing the leftist U.N.
[02:40:00.494 --> 02:40:02.956]  model, a false solution.
[02:40:02.996 --> 02:40:04.218]  That's the problem with LaRouche.
[02:40:04.298 --> 02:40:06.580]  But, no, he's not a wacko, as they say.
[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:07.701]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:40:07.762 --> 02:40:13.988]  And, you know, you were saying about the front page, the first headline was the Dallas beating Washington.
[02:40:14.569 --> 02:40:16.271]  You know, it's interesting you say that because...
[02:40:16.897 --> 02:40:17.117]  Amen.
[02:40:17.197 --> 02:40:17.317]  Amen.
[02:40:17.337 --> 02:40:17.417]  Amen.
[02:40:46.147 --> 02:40:50.110]  I told him, I said, the first thing I asked the kid was, he just moved into a new house.
[02:40:50.390 --> 02:40:51.311]  He moved over to Jersey.
[02:40:51.331 --> 02:40:53.232]  They moved to Jersey for my brother's job.
[02:40:53.572 --> 02:40:57.915]  And I said, how do you like your new school?
[02:40:57.955 --> 02:40:59.956]  He says, oh, well, the sports is a lot better.
[02:40:59.976 --> 02:41:02.918]  Yeah, they set the parameters.
[02:41:02.958 --> 02:41:04.019]  They set the debates.
[02:41:04.279 --> 02:41:05.500]  We've got to stop letting them do that.
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:06.641]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:06.681 --> 02:41:08.122]  Last call, John in Florida.
[02:41:08.142 --> 02:41:08.682]  Go ahead, John.
[02:41:10.546 --> 02:41:10.966]  Hi, Alex?
[02:41:11.186 --> 02:41:11.427]  Yes.
[02:41:11.687 --> 02:41:12.847]  Hey, another good show.
[02:41:12.867 --> 02:41:16.590]  Not good participation with your listeners also.
[02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:19.692]  You know, the thing with these athletes is it's the money.
[02:41:19.752 --> 02:41:23.834]  All these young people are like, you know, gaga over the dollars and such.
[02:41:23.874 --> 02:41:30.578]  You know, they're the latest gladiatorial, you know, sort of what come along, you know.
[02:41:31.079 --> 02:41:33.160]  Anyway, the reason I called is twofold.
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:39.144]  Okay, first was I wanted to kind of like say something about that program with...
[02:41:40.735 --> 02:41:47.417]  Allen of Texas, who said that James, I mean John Lear, developed the Learjet.
[02:41:47.497 --> 02:41:48.678]  It was his father, William.
[02:41:49.538 --> 02:41:55.120]  But the show, and the host, I forget that famous guy's name, okay?
[02:41:55.220 --> 02:41:57.801]  You know who I'm talking about, out of Providence, Nevada.
[02:41:57.821 --> 02:42:03.722]  It was such that within the first hour, they had discussed the 9-11 incident.
[02:42:05.963 --> 02:42:12.307]  And of course, excluding the advertisements and the downtime for news, it was really about 25 minutes worth of commentary.
[02:42:13.248 --> 02:42:25.676]  And at that time, he did not discuss aliens and flying saucers, but the second hour and the third hour of the show went into Roswell, went into, you know, Bob Lazar, etc.
[02:42:25.696 --> 02:42:27.137]  And I'm not a late...
[02:42:28.517 --> 02:42:33.199]  I listen for about an hour beyond the 1 o'clock time.
[02:42:33.239 --> 02:42:48.003]  Sometimes it's an interesting program, but when Roswell and all of this stuff comes on, totally disconnected with the first hour of 9-11, a lot of the listening audience falls into the tar pit that you are so good at trying to make them recognize.
[02:42:48.043 --> 02:42:49.623]  I'm afraid that's what happened to Alan.
[02:42:49.803 --> 02:42:52.044]  He has blended everything together.
[02:42:52.624 --> 02:42:56.487]  Last night's program was distinctly two different topics.
[02:42:56.648 --> 02:43:10.519]  The first hour would be well worth your trying to get a tape of and listen to because John Lear is obviously a very talented and trained aviator and flies a lot of different aircraft.
[02:43:11.016 --> 02:43:26.587]  And he was saying how the pilots that took control of those planes must have had at least 1,500 hours of simulator training and a lot of other things, including what happened out there in Pennsylvania, that it was shot down by a military aircraft.
[02:43:26.627 --> 02:43:29.549]  So basically, was he saying that it couldn't be done because it couldn't?
[02:43:30.850 --> 02:43:31.511]  Repeat that, please.
[02:43:31.971 --> 02:43:35.674]  Was he saying that these idiots who couldn't even get a Cessna off the ground did it?
[02:43:36.764 --> 02:43:46.795]  No, he's saying that some other people, trained people, he wasn't exactly clear, but he was alluding to the fact that it may be a CIA military type.
[02:43:46.835 --> 02:43:48.737]  Here's the deal, John.
[02:43:49.357 --> 02:43:51.720]  We don't have to go to clear channels.
[02:43:52.521 --> 02:43:55.004]  And the Chupacabra people to get our answers.
[02:43:55.044 --> 02:43:56.185]  We have Road to Tyranny.
[02:43:56.505 --> 02:43:57.667]  We have Masters of Terror.
[02:43:57.687 --> 02:43:59.148]  We have the two books I've put out.
[02:43:59.529 --> 02:44:01.150]  We know what happened on 9-11.
[02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:02.752]  We have hundreds of smoking guns.
[02:44:03.093 --> 02:44:04.174]  We have the facts.
[02:44:04.534 --> 02:44:09.760]  They're having to address it and mix it in with the flying saucer stuff now to discredit it.
[02:44:10.420 --> 02:44:13.363]  Art Bell should not have done that.
[02:44:13.403 --> 02:44:14.584]  He should have had one topic.
[02:44:14.604 --> 02:44:15.965]  Well, look, I mean, he does a radio show.
[02:44:15.985 --> 02:44:16.986]  A lot of people listen and get confused.
[02:44:17.006 --> 02:44:18.647]  Sir, sir, sir, he does a radio show, and I don't care.
[02:44:18.967 --> 02:44:20.509]  Frankly, I don't want to talk about the guy on my show.
[02:44:20.749 --> 02:44:20.929]  Right.
[02:44:21.209 --> 02:44:21.610]  I just do.
[02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:22.450]  I will not do it.
[02:44:23.011 --> 02:44:24.212]  I'm not mad at you for bringing it up.
[02:44:24.292 --> 02:44:25.673]  I just, I don't listen to it.
[02:44:25.693 --> 02:44:26.153]  I don't care.
[02:44:27.154 --> 02:44:27.354]  Okay?
[02:44:27.915 --> 02:44:28.535]  Oh, I understand.
[02:44:28.715 --> 02:44:30.817]  I just wanted to kind of clarify what Alan was saying.
[02:44:31.378 --> 02:44:32.619]  No, I understand what happened.
[02:44:32.759 --> 02:44:34.560]  And look, they stick an hour of 9-11 in.
[02:44:35.931 --> 02:44:39.394]  With, you know, a couple hours of flying saucers, and look what happens.
[02:44:39.814 --> 02:44:40.174]  Exactly.
[02:44:40.255 --> 02:45:04.794]  But, like I said, that first part, talking about the hijacking and the World Trade Towers, you know, and the Pentagon, the man who piloted the aircraft into the Pentagon obviously had to be very well trained because he was going in at over 600 miles an hour, and as John Lear said, there are, like, you know, forces coming up from the ground, like, let's call it an airwave, that would have, like, you know, caused him...
[02:45:05.339 --> 02:45:10.120]  Incompetent, ill-trained aviator to miss the target and overshoot the Pentagon.
[02:45:28.958 --> 02:45:31.680]  I mean, 9-11, I've done... I did a show last week with Paul Watson.
[02:45:31.700 --> 02:45:33.100]  I did an hour and a half on it again.
[02:45:33.601 --> 02:45:36.762]  It's clear I'm going to have to do weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks of it again.
[02:45:37.563 --> 02:45:46.608]  Because the official story you're getting is an absolute fraud and these side tributaries of, boy, things sure are weird surrounding this.
[02:45:47.328 --> 02:45:49.969]  That's the globalists attempting to take control of these stories.
[02:45:51.390 --> 02:45:52.071]  I'm done with calls.
[02:45:52.111 --> 02:45:52.551]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:52.631 --> 02:45:55.833]  I just... I got a bunch of news I need to cover here in the final segment.
[02:45:56.013 --> 02:45:56.313]  I, uh...
[02:45:58.382 --> 02:46:04.585]  You know, so many people, so many professionals that would wake up to the New World Order won't because they saw the X-Files.
[02:46:04.625 --> 02:46:09.447]  They saw the episode where FEMA secretly runs the government and green aliens at the South Pole control it.
[02:46:10.407 --> 02:46:11.688]  FEMA really does run the country.
[02:46:11.708 --> 02:46:12.768]  We really are under tyranny.
[02:46:12.808 --> 02:46:14.029]  That's admitted executive orders.
[02:46:14.589 --> 02:46:18.971]  But the TV mixes green aliens in with it, and the whole thing's run by the Rothschild family.
[02:46:20.592 --> 02:46:24.293]  That's who is behind and running the sci-fi channel.
[02:46:24.513 --> 02:46:25.894]  That's who's pushing all this...
[02:46:27.358 --> 02:46:33.139]  The same people that brought you Rush Limbaugh, brought you the other shows, and it's just pabbling.
[02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:39.101]  And I'm sick of people in Austin walking up to me going, oh, you're so right about the New World Order, when are you going to talk about Planet X?
[02:46:39.121 --> 02:46:43.302]  When are you going to talk about all these new secret energy machines?
[02:46:43.402 --> 02:46:46.463]  Oh, just send this guy money and you'll be part of the new invention.
[02:46:48.003 --> 02:46:49.223]  That discredits us.
[02:46:49.243 --> 02:46:55.525]  They're talking about real issues, real items, what's really going on.
[02:46:57.153 --> 02:47:03.875]  The PNAC document from 2000 where they called for race-specific bioweapons to legitimize the use of killing whole races.
[02:47:04.636 --> 02:47:06.216]  The vice president wrote that.
[02:47:06.576 --> 02:47:09.197]  That's a lot scarier than little green men, folks.
[02:47:10.218 --> 02:47:11.298]  And that's real.
[02:47:12.098 --> 02:47:13.639]  That's real horror.
[02:47:14.479 --> 02:47:16.000]  And they're carrying out their plans.
[02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:18.601]  And they're setting up martial law in this country.
[02:47:19.361 --> 02:47:22.022]  And they're bringing in something a lot scarier than a chubacabra.
[02:47:23.138 --> 02:47:23.498]  Okay?
[02:47:23.638 --> 02:47:27.539]  They're bringing in men in black uniforms and ski masks trained to kill you and your family.
[02:47:28.519 --> 02:47:28.859]  Okay?
[02:47:29.419 --> 02:47:33.380]  They're doing real things that will affect every man, woman, and child on this planet.
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:38.521]  They're putting fluoride in your water and toxins and viruses in your vaccines.
[02:47:40.342 --> 02:47:48.784]  I talked to a very well-respected practicing physician in town last week who's a family physician.
[02:47:48.824 --> 02:47:50.904]  He told me, he said, Alex, they're still giving.
[02:47:51.966 --> 02:47:54.687]  Polio vaccines from the 60s.
[02:47:55.187 --> 02:48:01.410]  Oral polio vaccines with SV40 still in it at major institutions here in Austin.
[02:48:03.570 --> 02:48:04.931]  Yeah, and I said, will you come on the air and talk about it?
[02:48:04.951 --> 02:48:05.791]  He goes, no way.
[02:48:07.972 --> 02:48:12.854]  There is a clinic right here in town, a major institution, and this is the one he knows of.
[02:48:14.074 --> 02:48:21.157]  He says it's happening all over the state, giving people liquid SV40-containing polio vaccines.
[02:48:22.196 --> 02:48:26.118]  It's a lot scarier than some idiot seeing a goat man.
[02:48:26.138 --> 02:48:30.221]  I will not talk about ghost stories on my show.
[02:48:31.201 --> 02:48:32.902]  I will not talk about Atlantis.
[02:48:33.102 --> 02:48:37.805]  I will not talk about Planet X. I will not do it.
[02:48:38.265 --> 02:48:39.566]  Do you understand?
[02:48:40.567 --> 02:48:43.208]  I will talk about real things.
[02:48:44.089 --> 02:48:48.592]  If I'd talk about little green men, I'd be on 300 radio stations instead of 80 or 90 right now.
[02:48:51.374 --> 02:48:53.436]  I guess we're on more than that if you count all the FMs.
[02:48:54.718 --> 02:48:55.558]  Oh, I'm out of time.
[02:48:55.578 --> 02:48:57.200]  Oh, man, I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:48:57.741 --> 02:49:02.526]  Oh, I can't listen to the trash anymore.
[02:49:02.566 --> 02:49:05.269]  I can't watch the TV, read the newspapers, pure torture.
[02:49:06.260 --> 02:49:13.044]  We'll come back and I'll just accelerate through about ten different stories and who knows, maybe take time out to plug my videos.
[02:49:13.084 --> 02:49:22.949]  If you want to wake somebody up about 9-11, get Road to Tyranny, get Police State 3, get Masters of Terror, get Order Out of Chaos, go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:49:23.890 --> 02:49:24.630]  Do it, folks.
[02:49:25.570 --> 02:49:28.272]  Support this show and tell ten people a day about this broadcast.
[02:49:28.452 --> 02:49:30.113]  We've got to counter all this trash.
[02:49:33.371 --> 02:49:40.177]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:49:40.517 --> 02:49:41.878]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:49:42.079 --> 02:49:44.281]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:49:44.441 --> 02:49:46.523]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:49:46.803 --> 02:49:51.727]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:52.067 --> 02:49:56.111]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:56.351 --> 02:49:56.751]  We're good to go.
[02:50:20.069 --> 02:50:27.116]  That's 888-253-3139, or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[02:50:27.417 --> 02:50:28.117]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:50:32.521 --> 02:50:33.182]  We're good to go.
[02:50:51.497 --> 02:50:53.298]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:50:53.579 --> 02:50:56.881]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:57.221 --> 02:51:07.688]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:51:07.989 --> 02:51:08.469]  That's right.
[02:51:08.669 --> 02:51:15.794]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:51:16.074 --> 02:51:20.077]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter.
[02:51:20.077 --> 02:51:20.277]  Oh my God!
[02:51:20.297 --> 02:51:24.640]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:51:43.945 --> 02:51:44.746]  This is Pat Cooper.
[02:51:44.786 --> 02:51:47.248]  Tony DelVecchio is coming to this station very soon.
[02:51:47.288 --> 02:51:47.848]  I'm sweet.
[02:51:47.888 --> 02:51:49.229]  I book any day now.
[02:51:49.690 --> 02:51:50.631]  You're going to love his show.
[02:51:52.292 --> 02:51:57.456]  That's all about this with your host, Tony DelVecchio, Saturday evenings from 9 to 10 p.m.
[02:51:57.516 --> 02:52:00.779]  Central Time, right here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:52:02.242 --> 02:52:03.163]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[02:52:03.183 --> 02:52:10.328]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[02:52:10.588 --> 02:52:13.490]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[02:52:13.691 --> 02:52:19.335]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[02:52:19.595 --> 02:52:23.618]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[02:52:24.038 --> 02:52:28.502]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[02:52:36.623 --> 02:52:40.165]  From 11 to 2 weekdays Central Time.
[02:52:40.185 --> 02:52:42.347]  Back from 9 to midnight Central.
[02:52:43.047 --> 02:52:44.168]  I don't mean to get upset.
[02:52:45.269 --> 02:52:52.034]  I just don't... Everybody spends their time on little green men and goat people and Frosty the Snowman.
[02:52:53.435 --> 02:52:54.016]  I won't do it.
[02:52:54.976 --> 02:52:55.877]  I mean, I will not do it.
[02:52:55.917 --> 02:53:00.961]  I mean, last week I read New Scientist and Associated Press and all these other articles about
[02:53:01.912 --> 02:53:04.915]  Bio-weapons that will kill any mammal they come in contact with.
[02:53:04.955 --> 02:53:07.517]  Our government producing thousands of gallons of it.
[02:53:08.898 --> 02:53:16.986]  And the globalists are saying get ready for it and building up the infrastructure to take over during a crisis and then force inoculating us and bringing in foreign troops.
[02:53:17.306 --> 02:53:18.527]  I have all the mainstream news.
[02:53:18.587 --> 02:53:19.148]  It's happening.
[02:53:19.468 --> 02:53:21.530]  Nightmarish, Red Dawn-type stuff.
[02:53:23.031 --> 02:53:25.974]  But still, people walking to me on the street want to tell me about aliens.
[02:53:26.724 --> 02:53:27.485]  Lizard people.
[02:53:27.985 --> 02:53:29.927]  All of this just idiocy.
[02:53:29.947 --> 02:53:32.349]  And I'm not mad at the listeners who called in bringing up the subjects.
[02:53:32.869 --> 02:53:35.712]  I'm irritated by the mindlessness.
[02:53:36.778 --> 02:53:37.719]  That's what I'm angry about.
[02:53:37.759 --> 02:54:05.102]  Look, if you're tired of having stuff that isn't documented, if you want something real that will affect change, if you want to be part of the solution, get Road to Tyranny, get Masters of Terror, get Police State 3 Total Enslaving, get the new video, Matrix of Evil, where Ron Paul talks about those running the country believing in world government and the neocons and Cynthia McKinney talking about the UN and government-sponsored terror and excerpts of three of my speeches and Colonel Craig Roberts and Frank Morales on the police state.
[02:54:05.819 --> 02:54:08.801]  Call right now, folks, if you're sick and tired of the idiocy.
[02:54:09.162 --> 02:54:13.605]  The power of you getting these videos and making copies of them and getting them out to people is unbelievable.
[02:54:13.625 --> 02:54:13.965]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:54:14.125 --> 02:54:18.909]  That's 888-253-3139 or Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:35.883]  South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:54:37.905 --> 02:54:38.565]  Don't wait.
[02:54:38.685 --> 02:54:39.986]  Take action, folks.
[02:54:40.546 --> 02:54:41.587]  Deal in reality.
[02:54:42.408 --> 02:54:44.129]  Again, 888-253-3139.
[02:54:46.931 --> 02:54:49.573]  How long we been talking about touchscreen election fraud?
[02:54:49.613 --> 02:54:50.033]  How long?
[02:54:50.934 --> 02:54:51.254]  How long?
[02:54:51.929 --> 02:54:52.409]  For years.
[02:54:52.990 --> 02:54:55.172]  How the CIA runs it, how it's a big scam.
[02:54:55.732 --> 02:54:59.976]  Well, now Florida's having to weigh into the thing with Fox News.
[02:55:00.076 --> 02:55:04.000]  Touchscreen voting could present problem for Floridians.
[02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:07.163]  And they say touchscreen machines record votes on the computer hard drives.
[02:55:07.523 --> 02:55:08.884]  No receipt, no paper record.
[02:55:09.205 --> 02:55:11.727]  Say critics, no way to detect election fraud.
[02:55:12.387 --> 02:55:14.690]  And they get into how this is happening.
[02:55:14.710 --> 02:55:17.252]  But don't worry, the government's going to make sure it's all fair for you.
[02:55:18.746 --> 02:55:26.349]  Behind tonight's ABC Jesus special, news team bases report on a virally anti-Christian novel.
[02:55:28.090 --> 02:55:29.771]  And again, The Last Temptation of Christ.
[02:55:30.972 --> 02:55:40.776]  The DaVici Code by Dan Brown, the primetime television program featuring ABC news reporter Elizabeth Vargas, is featuring what has been called a crackpot theory.
[02:55:41.476 --> 02:55:45.258]  And they're going to report it as news that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and
[02:55:46.092 --> 02:55:48.453]  Just, you know, and where's the outrage?
[02:55:48.473 --> 02:55:52.294]  I'm sure, who knows, Pat Robertson might endorse it.
[02:55:53.394 --> 02:55:57.575]  Nation of TV slackers dimly aware of ignorance is not blessed.
[02:55:57.595 --> 02:56:08.558]  Again, in England, 73% of people, 16 to 24, don't know who the vice president is over there, the deputy prime minister.
[02:56:08.638 --> 02:56:09.678]  And 47% of everybody don't know.
[02:56:09.698 --> 02:56:11.678]  And that's better than our numbers.
[02:56:12.599 --> 02:56:13.799]  Article, long article.
[02:56:14.907 --> 02:56:22.671]  From the Sunday Herald, Big British paper, five Israelis were seen filming a jet liners plunged into the Twin Towers September 11, 2001.
[02:56:23.691 --> 02:56:30.554]  This is where they part of a massive spy ring which shadowed the 9-11 hijackers and knew that Al-Qaeda planned the devastating terrorist attacks on the U.S.
[02:56:31.375 --> 02:56:34.136]  Then it goes into saying that no, it's not an urban legend.
[02:56:34.156 --> 02:56:34.596]  It's true.
[02:56:34.656 --> 02:56:35.256]  It's admitted.
[02:56:36.237 --> 02:56:42.960]  When they went back to the place where they were employed, everybody had pulled out at the moving company and it turned out the owner was a known Mossad asset.
[02:56:43.729 --> 02:56:46.090]  We'll talk more about this tomorrow or tonight, obviously.
[02:56:46.911 --> 02:56:58.978]  But we've covered it in the films, and I don't believe Israel carried the attacks out, but they certainly were involved in basically shepherding the terrorists, just like the FBI was.
[02:57:00.139 --> 02:57:05.863]  And everybody from Israel to Saudi Arabia to Germany to Egypt warned us.
[02:57:07.726 --> 02:57:16.029]  Also, the White House is trying to block more documents of 9-11 being brought forward, and judges involved, the Supreme Court may throw out the suits.
[02:57:17.049 --> 02:57:17.789]  I'm out of time.
[02:57:17.830 --> 02:57:19.010]  See you back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:57:19.050 --> 02:57:19.510]  Back tomorrow.
[02:57:19.530 --> 02:57:20.190]  Have a great day.
[02:57:23.771 --> 02:57:28.993]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:57:29.133 --> 02:57:34.275]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere.
