[00:00:03.917 --> 00:00:07.140]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:15.406]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.167]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:19.008]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.450]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.131]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:26.434]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:31.018]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:53.512]  We've got author and researcher, New World Order investigator, George Humphrey, joining us in the second and third hours today to ride shotgun with us to talk about Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, the latest developments on September 11th, and the police state
[00:00:54.344 --> 00:01:05.846]  And how we are attempting to shift the paradigm of the American people out of the false reality into the reality of what is actually developing.
[00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.087]  Big show lined up for you.
[00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:12.608]  I'm going to go through a ton of news and information in this first hour.
[00:01:13.088 --> 00:01:20.289]  And we're going to have wide open phones all day today or this morning or tonight, depending on what time zone you're listening to us in.
[00:01:21.184 --> 00:01:26.405]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:31.306]  That's toll-free in Canada and the United States.
[00:01:31.547 --> 00:01:38.868]  It's on your dime from Europe, but a lot of people call in from Australia, New Zealand, Germany, England, Mexico.
[00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:41.109]  We always love to hear from you.
[00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:46.410]  Just dial your access code, and then 800-259-9231.
[00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.871]  And if you're calling from a foreign country, we'll put you to the head of the line.
[00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:57.869]  The only person that can preempt you and go ahead of you is someone who disagrees with the host or my callers or guests.
[00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.311]  So you're all welcome anytime to call into the show at 800-259-9231.
[00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:09.855]  The premiere websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:10.155 --> 00:02:16.498]  You'll definitely want to check those out because it's vital news and information posted there multiple times daily.
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.081]  Where to begin?
[00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:19.883]  There is so much.
[00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:26.251]  This is out of television news, mainstream media.
[00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.556]  This is out of television news.
[00:02:30.537 --> 00:02:35.044]  Is your television watching you by Philip Swan?
[00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:37.067]  And guess what?
[00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:44.451]  Your TV's watching you, and they have microphones in the cable boxes and the satellite boxes, and they're listening to you.
[00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:45.672]  Now, I've already announced this.
[00:02:45.752 --> 00:02:50.315]  It's been in the news in the past, but it doesn't seem to sink in with people.
[00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:50.995]  That's coming up.
[00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:53.217]  4,500 U.S.
[00:02:53.737 --> 00:02:58.440]  troops might head to Liberia, so the empire is expanding, or liberations.
[00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.613]  Pentagon plans draft.
[00:03:01.673 --> 00:03:03.856]  That's the headline out of the Charlotte Observer.
[00:03:03.896 --> 00:03:04.377]  That's right.
[00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:05.639]  Pentagon plans draft.
[00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.141]  They've been lining it up for a while.
[00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:10.286]  The draft for the glorious empire.
[00:03:12.162 --> 00:03:16.743]  Also, warning of toxic aftermath from uranium munitions.
[00:03:17.343 --> 00:03:20.684]  This from the Army's former chief official studying this.
[00:03:21.224 --> 00:03:26.745]  He says, yes, it's killing and maiming our troops and no one seems to care, but that's the new patriotism.
[00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:34.207]  Being hollow, being mindless, only worshiping the flag, but detesting everything the flag stands for.
[00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:39.208]  By the way, I called in on a national radio show this morning and actually got through
[00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:45.084]  And the host would not let me talk and hung up on me and said that I hated America.
[00:03:45.285 --> 00:03:47.525]  I know it's you that hates America and didn't know it.
[00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:49.786]  So I'll talk about that too.
[00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:52.567]  Men ordered to stay in.
[00:03:53.147 --> 00:03:54.868]  Those from ABC News.
[00:03:55.508 --> 00:03:58.529]  Men ordered to stay in their homes in Spain at night.
[00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.850]  That's a new feminist move by the government.
[00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.791]  They say it's very loving and if you're against this, you're against women.
[00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:11.472]  There's a nighttime curfew now in a major city because, well, men should be doing more of the housework.
[00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:20.198]  So this is the micromanagement of government and one of the globalist's biggest allies in Juan Carlos, the King of Spain, and others.
[00:04:20.598 --> 00:04:28.763]  And we just had the President of Spain here in Austin last week calling for America being broken up and La Raza and Mecha taking over.
[00:04:28.803 --> 00:04:30.224]  So we'll get into that, too.
[00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:33.386]  Kind of an interesting tie-in there.
[00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:37.565]  UPI investigates the vaccine conflict.
[00:04:37.605 --> 00:04:38.725]  It's a nine-page article.
[00:04:38.765 --> 00:04:43.087]  Admits the vaccines are killing children, rotting their intestines out, attacking their brains.
[00:04:44.068 --> 00:04:51.971]  And they say the CDC doesn't care, but is taking some vaccines off the shelf because it might scare people away from taking them.
[00:04:52.292 --> 00:05:03.597]  Not that they kill your kid, or brain damage him, or implode their intestines, but, uh, oh, and of course there's more on 15-month-old babies and others now on good old Ritalin.
[00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:06.797]  Just a gigantic show lined up for you.
[00:05:06.817 --> 00:05:08.259]  You do not want to miss a single second.
[00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:13.490]  If you're like most Americans, you've heard how low interest rates are these days.
[00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.671]  So why are you still struggling to pay off debt?
[00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:18.511]  Rates on debt consolidation loans are at all-time lows.
[00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:23.693]  So the time to consolidate your individual credit card balances, car loans, and other debt has never been better.
[00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:25.693]  And no one makes it easier than the credit people.
[00:05:25.813 --> 00:05:31.895]  The credit people offers homeowners consolidation loans that lower their monthly payments, making it possible to get out of debt quickly and easily.
[00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:33.116]  Fixed rates start as low as 5.25%.
[00:05:34.716 --> 00:05:35.236]  Slow credit?
[00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:35.897]  Bad credit?
[00:05:36.017 --> 00:05:36.577]  No problem!
[00:05:36.758 --> 00:05:42.682]  Our professional advisors will work with you to customize the loan just right for your needs, with no points or tack-on charges.
[00:05:42.922 --> 00:05:48.766]  Since interest rates have dropped, The Credit People has helped thousands of homeowners consolidate almost a billion dollars in loan debt.
[00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:49.667]  If you're a homeowner,

[00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.239]  1-800-794-2858.
[00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:14.512]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:14.692 --> 00:06:19.138]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:23.684]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:23.704 --> 00:06:25.025]  The New World Order.
[00:06:25.957 --> 00:06:27.580]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:40.657 --> 00:06:50.980]  Homeland Security, Executive Orders, Force Vaccinations, The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan American Union, Federal Gun Grants, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.522]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:00.943]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:00.963 --> 00:07:01.404]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:01.424 --> 00:07:03.244]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:09.586 --> 00:07:12.609]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:17.853]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:07:18.094 --> 00:07:22.457]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:07:22.738 --> 00:07:31.666]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:07:31.866 --> 00:07:35.489]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:40.817]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:07:41.097 --> 00:07:47.807]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:07:48.317 --> 00:07:48.978]  What about you?
[00:07:49.618 --> 00:07:54.962]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:07:56.203 --> 00:07:58.084]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.281]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:16.982]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.723 --> 00:08:18.883]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.484 --> 00:08:20.305]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:21.986]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.626 --> 00:08:26.389]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.933]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.718]  What's wrong with this picture?
[00:08:37.938 --> 00:08:38.499]  BBC!
[00:08:40.575 --> 00:08:44.778]  Doctors have prescribed Ritalin to children as young as 15 months.
[00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:50.302]  There is also concern that doctors are prescribing the drug without considering alternative treatments.
[00:08:51.823 --> 00:09:01.329]  Health spokesman Paul Burstow of the House of Commons has urged ministers to examine why the number of children being given the drug has increased so sharply.
[00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.133]  Over 6 million in this country on it at any one time.
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.461]  Tens of millions that have been on it.
[00:09:08.922 --> 00:09:13.866]  They're now giving Prozac and Luvox and other stuff to babies as young as 12 months.
[00:09:15.728 --> 00:09:23.455]  The child cries, they scream, they misbehave, and so mommy takes them down and says, let's give baby a chemical lobotomy.
[00:09:23.475 --> 00:09:27.099]  And the government says, yes, yes, yes, that's good.
[00:09:27.959 --> 00:09:31.683]  And then Ritalin causes heart palpitations, heart swelling,
[00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:39.283]  Brain shrinkage, literal striations and death into the tissue.
[00:09:40.043 --> 00:09:45.464]  I have seen x-rays and mainstream news articles of children that have been on Ritalin several years.
[00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:50.766]  The Prozac destroys their brain chemistry and shuts down their neuroreceptors.
[00:09:52.146 --> 00:09:54.727]  I mean, these are hardcore drugs.
[00:09:55.567 --> 00:10:00.068]  The whole psychotropic class is a hallucinogenic compound.
[00:10:00.108 --> 00:10:02.149]  That's actually the subgroup they're listed in.
[00:10:04.068 --> 00:10:18.920]  You've got Ritalin that is almost identical, just a slight change in the molecular form, as methamphetamine, or go pills, first developed by the British in World War I to give to frontline troops and then used by the Nazis.
[00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:23.204]  So let's just give it to the newborn babies.
[00:10:24.725 --> 00:10:32.472]  And when you're in the stores, you see the water for infants in the jugs, and it says, fortified with fluoride.
[00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:35.130]  Yum, yum, yum!
[00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:44.616]  And then you look at the thousands of medical reports about how it attacks the brain development, causes bone fractures, contrary to popular belief, but ah, so what?
[00:10:44.656 --> 00:10:45.897]  Give that to them as well.
[00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:54.462]  And then you read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, written in 1933,
[00:10:57.415 --> 00:11:04.598]  And he talks about a government plan to dumb down children at birth or in the womb to have a subclass of mindless idiots.
[00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:10.161]  So you can have a ruling elite who are more intelligent and can control the population.
[00:11:10.181 --> 00:11:16.984]  This is what feudalists have always done by trying to keep the serfs on tiny plots of land at subsistence level.
[00:11:17.304 --> 00:11:25.528]  So they're running so fast on the treadmill under malnutrition that they literally are retarded.
[00:11:27.245 --> 00:11:31.807]  We see this with the serfs of Japan, of Europe, we saw it with the serfs of Russia.
[00:11:31.827 --> 00:11:35.169]  It's the same system, but now it's more sophisticated.
[00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:40.351]  You say, wait a minute, Aldous Huxley, he was a fiction writer.
[00:11:40.391 --> 00:11:49.675]  Well, his brother was the first Secretary General of a criminal organization that Bush just signed on to and increased funding for.
[00:11:49.695 --> 00:11:52.177]  He was the first Secretary General in 1946.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.761]  And was there for many years.
[00:11:55.382 --> 00:12:13.698]  Julian Huxley of UNESCO, and we've aired it here and I think we should air it again, the 45-minute speech, the last speech that Aldous Huxley, brother of Julian Huxley, gave at Berkeley University in California in 1962.
[00:12:15.439 --> 00:12:20.624]  And in the speech he said that Brave New World was actually the government plan
[00:12:21.391 --> 00:12:49.276]  and that he had gotten it from his brother who was a government minister at the time in the thirties in the British Socialist government and then of course later in the forties the first head of UNESCO and then we've read UNESCO documents their charter their policy on education where it says the family is the enemy quote and is a disease and must be quote eradicated
[00:12:50.603 --> 00:13:17.279]  And so you sit here, you sit here, buying their lies, buying their propaganda, buying their worship of celebrity, that's the diversion for the women, and the diversion of the sports for the men, a spectator society being poisoned and warped and twisted, and it's their own stated, long-term eugenics plan.
[00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:27.627]  I just read a article out of California where tens of thousands of women were forcibly sterilized for making under a B+.
[00:13:28.728 --> 00:13:36.534]  It happened in 30 of the states at a massive level, at lower levels, if you call thousands lower level, in the original 48.
[00:13:37.535 --> 00:13:42.098]  It went on until the mid-1980s and is still going on under new names.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.382]  Sharp rise in children's Ritalin use.
[00:13:47.422 --> 00:13:48.383]  That's the headline.
[00:13:50.626 --> 00:13:51.867]  Yeah, this is the new America.
[00:13:51.927 --> 00:13:59.351]  So you let your 14-month-old toddler drink Coca-Cola.
[00:14:01.052 --> 00:14:09.957]  I see babies drinking Diet Coke at the shopping malls full of aspartame and dyes and toxins.
[00:14:10.297 --> 00:14:12.218]  I see children gobbling cakes.
[00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:22.355]  cramming candy into their mouths and you wonder why your child bounces off the walls and then becomes angry 30 minutes later when they have the sugar crash.
[00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:25.636]  I mean, try it yourselves.
[00:14:25.676 --> 00:14:28.017]  Eat a candy bar and see how you feel 30 minutes later.
[00:14:28.077 --> 00:14:30.158]  And then you take your child to the doctor.
[00:14:30.198 --> 00:14:37.042]  Doctor Bobby or Jenny is angry and frustrated and crying a lot.
[00:14:37.522 --> 00:14:39.683]  The doctor doesn't say, what are you feeding them?
[00:14:40.464 --> 00:14:43.446]  The doctor says, hmm, how about Ritalin?
[00:14:44.207 --> 00:14:45.708]  How about Prozac?
[00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:47.730]  And folks, I'm understating how bad it is.
[00:14:47.750 --> 00:15:01.220]  The governor of Oregon, just last year, he's a psychiatrist by the way, called for drugging upwards of 70% of children at birth, and he says there's new developments perhaps in utero.
[00:15:01.861 --> 00:15:05.363]  They will genetically test all mothers, and they want to make a law.
[00:15:05.744 --> 00:15:07.365]  I'm not kidding, this is from the governor's office.
[00:15:08.109 --> 00:15:09.710]  We read it on air and had guests on about it.
[00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:14.654]  And there could be a drug pack delivered into the womb.
[00:15:15.955 --> 00:15:17.336]  This is the new America.
[00:15:17.356 --> 00:15:18.577]  And you're thinking, that'll never happen.
[00:15:19.017 --> 00:15:19.397]  Oh really?
[00:15:19.417 --> 00:15:25.181]  We told you five, six, seven years ago about the satellite tracker hardware in your new cars and how they plan to touch you.
[00:15:25.642 --> 00:15:28.304]  Now even Lord Limbaugh is talking about it.
[00:15:28.784 --> 00:15:36.750]  You'd better wake up to the science fiction horror that we're all living in here or it's only going to get worse.
[00:15:38.832 --> 00:15:58.247]  This morning I was doing some chores, going to the office supply store, buying more paper, and buying my wife a power bar, and yes, getting myself a Starbucks coffee.
[00:15:58.948 --> 00:16:01.250]  Corporate minion, I guess that I am at that level.
[00:16:02.191 --> 00:16:04.953]  And I was listening to the Mike Gallagher Show.
[00:16:05.053 --> 00:16:07.255]  It's a large nationally syndicated show.
[00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:25.964]  They had a fill-in host, and so I called in quickly and got in, and they were discussing, they said, if you don't like the American flag or you're intimidated by it, call in.
[00:16:27.745 --> 00:16:34.970]  And I told the call screener, I said, look, I didn't play dumb, I'll give them that, normally if you don't play dumb they won't let you on.
[00:16:36.092 --> 00:16:41.494]  I said, look, I support the American flag, but only because it symbolizes the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:16:42.034 --> 00:16:45.116]  And we're losing the Bill of Rights and Constitution, what the flag symbolizes.
[00:16:45.476 --> 00:16:47.837]  I said, the flag doesn't give us liberty, as the host was saying.
[00:16:47.877 --> 00:16:49.837]  He said, the flag did all this for us.
[00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:54.159]  I said, what it symbolizes simply enshrines our God-given rights.
[00:16:54.239 --> 00:16:55.559]  Read the Ninth and Tenth Amendment.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.321]  Boys and girls, the Bill of Rights and Constitution doesn't give you your rights.
[00:17:00.841 --> 00:17:04.523]  No matter how much we love it here on this show, that stuff comes from God, okay?
[00:17:04.543 --> 00:17:05.263]  That's the founders.
[00:17:06.917 --> 00:17:08.398]  And I said, let me give you an example.
[00:17:08.478 --> 00:17:17.583]  Hitler took the German flag, not the Nazi flag, the German flag and said, either you support my policies or you're against this flag and all the patriots.
[00:17:17.983 --> 00:17:18.884]  And people bought that.
[00:17:19.424 --> 00:17:21.745]  So I get on the air and he says, you hate America.
[00:17:21.785 --> 00:17:24.287]  You've made my point and talked over me and faded me down.
[00:17:24.347 --> 00:17:33.672]  And I tried to point out that the liberals are on the extreme, but think about the American Indians being killed and slavery and the blacks and all the rest of it.
[00:17:33.712 --> 00:17:34.092]  And I said,
[00:17:34.682 --> 00:17:42.769]  You know, they see the flag as being used and expropriated to carry out evil, to blind the people as a mindless symbol.
[00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.153]  And I said, we can't let people take the flag and use it for their own aims.
[00:17:47.193 --> 00:17:49.835]  I was going to try to say, you know, advertisers do this a lot of times.
[00:17:51.417 --> 00:17:52.918]  I said, we've just got to be cogent of this.
[00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.900]  Well, he cut me off and said I hated America.
[00:17:57.972 --> 00:18:03.796]  And then I drove around finishing my errands for another 20 minutes and heard callers going, how dare you know the traitor?
[00:18:04.096 --> 00:18:05.497]  Can you believe that guy?
[00:18:05.517 --> 00:18:07.619]  The flag gives us our rights.
[00:18:07.699 --> 00:18:15.885]  And the host goes, yes, but he's saying that the president uses it and says you've got to support it or you don't support me.
[00:18:17.568 --> 00:18:19.129]  And this lady goes, well, yes, that's right.
[00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.033]  Our troops and the President give us that flag, and that's why we've got freedom, because of the President.
[00:18:24.393 --> 00:18:31.557]  The host didn't like that, because here was the caller worshipping it so much that she was making my point for me.
[00:18:33.035 --> 00:18:50.161]  Again, it's this hollow, mindless patriotism that Ron Paul, who just so happens to have the most conservative voting record in Congress, the most constitutionally based voting record, almost perfect, it's like a 99 on my scale, same thing with the John Birch Society and their review of him.
[00:18:51.822 --> 00:19:01.265]  And he's exposed Bush as a phony, destroying America, founded by communists, Trotskyites, I mean, I got the neocon story still posted, main page, his whole speech, eventfulwars.com.
[00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:11.216]  And when he cut me off was when I tried to say that, you know, well, PNAC said they needed to have a terrorist attack to get us behind this false patriotism for war.
[00:19:11.236 --> 00:19:14.378]  As soon as I said PNAC, he talked over me and hung up on me.
[00:19:15.618 --> 00:19:20.942]  In fact, I got to turn up the radio and hear the delay and hear him panicking to get me off.
[00:19:22.503 --> 00:19:23.583]  I wouldn't let me get it out.
[00:19:25.024 --> 00:19:31.108]  Don't want the foolish neocon followers to wake up that they've been stabbed in the back, do you?
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:49.896]  I don't want to get off into a big, long discussion of that because I've got a bunch of news to cover in the next 40 minutes before George Humphrey, former city council member, very successful businessman, author, lecturer, researcher, joins us, lives right here in Austin, good friend of mine, talk about a host of issues and take your calls.
[00:19:49.916 --> 00:19:54.140]  But we'll launch into television news.
[00:19:55.186 --> 00:19:57.027]  Article by Philip Swan, Mainstream News.
[00:19:57.468 --> 00:20:00.149]  Is your television watching you?
[00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.113]  And we'll get into mysterious diseases haunt U.S.
[00:20:05.173 --> 00:20:05.593]  troops.
[00:20:06.514 --> 00:20:07.794]  Radiation poisoning.
[00:20:07.814 --> 00:20:08.495]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:10.393 --> 00:20:19.018]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:19.239 --> 00:20:30.505]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:30.726 --> 00:20:33.367]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:33.727 --> 00:20:37.830]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.171]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:40.331 --> 00:20:42.193]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:42.393 --> 00:20:48.416]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:48.676 --> 00:20:54.340]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:22:09.634 --> 00:22:13.896]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:22:14.336 --> 00:22:18.878]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:22:19.259 --> 00:22:24.121]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:22:24.501 --> 00:22:26.302]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:22:26.322 --> 00:22:27.342]  can barely be read.
[00:22:27.362 --> 00:22:28.603]  It has faded that much.
[00:22:28.963 --> 00:22:32.865]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.

[00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:04.224]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.532]  Every cell of the body has a receptor site for our master hormone called growth hormone.
[00:23:13.932 --> 00:23:17.033]  The role of growth hormone is to instruct the cells to repair.
[00:23:17.413 --> 00:23:22.435]  This hormone is in the highest concentrations in the body between the ages of infancy and your early twenties.
[00:23:22.855 --> 00:23:26.236]  Hence, this is the major reason why the body repairs so well when young.
[00:23:26.816 --> 00:23:29.959]  This is why the incidence of disease is so much lower when young.
[00:23:30.379 --> 00:23:32.181]  This is why you're skinnier when young.
[00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:35.303]  Looking and feeling young is a direct result of your chemistry.
[00:23:35.743 --> 00:23:39.306]  Science brings us closer to the threshold of eternal youth every day.
[00:23:39.947 --> 00:23:42.689]  Cocoon GH is a sublingual form of growth hormone.
[00:23:43.069 --> 00:23:44.871]  When used twice a day, people report
[00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:46.011]  Keep sleep.
[00:23:46.271 --> 00:23:48.092]  Improve mood, memory and energy.
[00:23:48.492 --> 00:23:49.552]  Losses of body fat.
[00:23:49.912 --> 00:23:51.612]  Improve strength and sex drive.
[00:23:52.112 --> 00:23:53.273]  Reduction of joint pains.
[00:23:53.553 --> 00:23:55.173]  Improve blood sugar and more.
[00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:57.434]  Improve your chemistry and improve your life.
[00:23:57.654 --> 00:23:58.994]  Satisfaction guaranteed.
[00:23:59.094 --> 00:23:59.474]  Call 800-814-5031 800-814-5031 800-814-5031
[00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:21.579]  I remember eight years ago getting a call on local radio from a electrical engineer who even
[00:24:30.266 --> 00:24:56.653]  Dropped by the radio station studio was waiting for me in the parking lot one night and said sir I want to show you diagrams they plan to use the new digital cable boxes when digital TV comes out and this is eight years ago there wasn't even really a discussion of it I'd hardly even heard about it he said there's a plan to use these to watch you and listen to you and he was all afraid looking over his shoulder he was driving a brand new Cadillac and
[00:24:57.654 --> 00:24:58.575]  Fit the M.O.
[00:24:58.795 --> 00:24:59.995]  of a serious individual.
[00:25:00.256 --> 00:25:05.599]  I didn't pick up that he was lying, and he showed me some of the documents and said, I can't give these to you.
[00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:07.300]  You need to go research this yourself.
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.961]  This is proprietary.
[00:25:09.001 --> 00:25:10.742]  And he got in his car and drove off.
[00:25:12.743 --> 00:25:26.731]  And then about, what, three years ago, I was scanning around on the Internet and found an MSNBC News article, and it said the new Scientific Atlantic cable boxes that we use right here in Austin and all over the country
[00:25:28.651 --> 00:25:29.672]  Watch what you watch.
[00:25:29.732 --> 00:25:31.312]  That is, they don't physically watch you.
[00:25:31.552 --> 00:25:33.093]  They track what you watch.
[00:25:33.133 --> 00:25:43.877]  The different shows have psychological scores, different ads have different psychological scores, how long you watch, if you flip away, if you flip back, and they're selling the data and doing things with the government with it.
[00:25:45.758 --> 00:25:51.460]  And then, a couple weeks ago, I was talking to a Time Warner installer.
[00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:56.381]  And this isn't just one of the general cable installers.
[00:25:56.441 --> 00:25:57.702]  He does the cable modems.
[00:25:58.162 --> 00:25:59.643]  He does the fixing of the systems.
[00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:00.984]  He's one of their higher-up guys.
[00:26:03.505 --> 00:26:06.687]  And he also subs and does some contracting for the phone company.
[00:26:06.707 --> 00:26:08.788]  And he said, Mr. Jones, I want to show you something.
[00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:10.930]  Put me out to his truck.
[00:26:12.591 --> 00:26:16.453]  Opened up a digital cable box and showed me the microphone inside of it.
[00:26:18.454 --> 00:26:30.198]  And he then went into how the new fiber optic system for the newest cable box has a bunch of parts that the manual doesn't even say what they're for.
[00:26:31.419 --> 00:26:36.480]  And he said he'd shown it to other engineers and it looked like it was some type of imaging system.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.921]  But again, we don't know on that point.
[00:26:38.621 --> 00:26:40.562]  And I'm going to do a story on this in the near future.
[00:26:41.382 --> 00:26:46.404]  But this is so crazy, so bizarre, the average person has trouble even
[00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:52.410]  Contemporizing it, or trying to even interface with it.
[00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:56.533]  This is out of television news, mainstream media.
[00:26:57.814 --> 00:27:01.177]  We're posting it on Infowars.com right now.
[00:27:02.137 --> 00:27:08.042]  Could the federal government find out what you're watching on TV even if you're not the subject of a criminal investigation?
[00:27:09.643 --> 00:27:11.004]  This is mainstream news, folks.
[00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:18.250]  If you're a satellite TV or TIV owner, the answer is yes, according to legal experts and industry officials.
[00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:29.247]  Under the USA Patriot Act, passed a month after the 9-1-1 terrorist attack, the Feds can force a non-cable TV operator to disclose every show you have watched.
[00:27:29.788 --> 00:27:34.771]  The government just has to say that the request is related to a terrorism investigation.
[00:27:35.749 --> 00:27:50.961]  said Jay Stanley, a technology expert for the American Civil Liberties Union, under section 215 of the Patriot Act, you don't even have to be the target of the investigation, plus your TV provider is prohibited from informing you that the Feds have requested your personal information.
[00:27:51.021 --> 00:28:04.032]  Now, we covered two days after 9-1-1, we got the bill, or two days after they passed the Patriot Act in October, we got the bill, when we covered 215 and 213 and dozens of other subsections,
[00:28:05.054 --> 00:28:06.235]  This is almost two years ago.
[00:28:07.056 --> 00:28:07.536]  19 months ago.
[00:28:08.838 --> 00:28:09.919]  No, 20 months ago.
[00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:17.906]  And we warned everybody, and we went over this, and we're finally seeing it on MSNBC and TV news and other websites.
[00:28:19.668 --> 00:28:25.233]  But the average person in the checkout line will still laugh at me if I warn them about this, or they'll say, oh good, I want to accept it.
[00:28:26.932 --> 00:28:27.352]  Oh, good.
[00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:28.633]  Well, I don't have anything to hide.
[00:28:28.733 --> 00:28:30.314]  Oh, yeah, your TV's just tracking you.
[00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:32.976]  And it just so happens to have a microphone in it, hooked in two-way.
[00:28:33.016 --> 00:28:34.316]  But, you know, that's part of freedom.
[00:28:34.356 --> 00:28:37.478]  You know, in 1984, they had microphones in their TVs.
[00:28:37.518 --> 00:28:38.319]  And what's wrong with that?
[00:28:38.339 --> 00:28:39.079]  You know, that's freedom.
[00:28:39.099 --> 00:28:40.000]  1984 is freedom.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:41.901]  That's conservative.
[00:28:42.181 --> 00:28:44.522]  It's liberal to be for privacy in the Second Amendment.
[00:28:44.582 --> 00:28:45.623]  I forgot I'm a liberal.
[00:28:45.643 --> 00:28:46.604]  I got accused of it today.
[00:28:48.004 --> 00:28:48.825]  On national radio.
[00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:54.011]  So, under Section 215 of the Act, you don't even have to be the target of an investigation.
[00:28:54.471 --> 00:28:58.532]  Plus, your TV provider is prohibited from informing you that the Feds have requested your personal information.
[00:29:00.312 --> 00:29:01.412]  The language is very broad.
[00:29:01.472 --> 00:29:06.073]  Mr. Stanley said it allows the FBI to force a company to turn over the records of their customers.
[00:29:06.113 --> 00:29:09.374]  They don't even need a reasonable suspicion of criminal behavior.
[00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:13.875]  Well, it's a lot worse, Mr. Stanley, because
[00:29:16.546 --> 00:29:32.070]  In 96, the federal government funded $4 billion, ended up being $8.5 billion, to put in snooping hubs into cable, telephone, email systems, the backbone of hubs, digital hubs, that analog is all fed through.
[00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:36.652]  And it's all hooked into Astraline.
[00:29:37.772 --> 00:29:41.493]  And that's known as Total Information Awareness Network, the n-word focus system there.
[00:29:41.953 --> 00:29:43.574]  Now known as Catlin and other systems.
[00:29:43.594 --> 00:29:44.954]  They keep changing the names to confuse you.
[00:29:46.025 --> 00:29:48.146]  And so they can just dial right in and listen to you.
[00:29:48.886 --> 00:29:54.188]  But see, the average person doesn't want to take up the responsibility of even psychologically admitting this.
[00:29:55.229 --> 00:29:56.850]  I mean, it's gonna get worse.
[00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:58.470]  Where's it gonna go from here?
[00:30:00.611 --> 00:30:01.552]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.572 --> 00:30:03.612]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.513 --> 00:30:07.194]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.316 --> 00:30:16.521]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:30:17.201 --> 00:30:29.251]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... 800-569-4340 for your personal ozone generator, or visit on the web at cliffscott.com
[00:30:38.108 --> 00:30:46.190]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:50.871]  We do this show live and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time as well.
[00:30:50.891 --> 00:30:56.673]  And for those of you that work at night, the night owls, you can simply tune in
[00:30:57.975 --> 00:30:59.276]  1 to 4 a.m.
[00:30:59.296 --> 00:31:01.077]  1 to 4 a.m.
[00:31:01.237 --> 00:31:02.517]  Overnight Central Standard Time.
[00:31:02.557 --> 00:31:05.218]  So 9 hours a day of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:06.539]  We're about to go to Ed in Canada.
[00:31:06.579 --> 00:31:10.741]  Dave in... I don't know where Dave's calling from.
[00:31:11.701 --> 00:31:16.544]  Jeff in... down in New Orleans and others.
[00:31:16.564 --> 00:31:17.684]  Where did you say Dave was calling from?
[00:31:18.725 --> 00:31:19.925]  Arkansas and others.
[00:31:20.465 --> 00:31:22.626]  The toll free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:31:28.323 --> 00:31:34.128]  Now, earlier, I'm just going to mention some of the news that's coming up, then I'll go back to your calls, and we've got a guest coming up in the second hour as well.
[00:31:35.109 --> 00:31:41.735]  Earlier, I started going into a television news report, and that's the name of the news service, television news, it's mainstream media.
[00:31:42.796 --> 00:31:51.284]  It says, could the federal government find out what you're watching on TV even if you're not the subject of a criminal investigation, if you're a TV or ITV owner?
[00:31:52.142 --> 00:31:55.905]  The answer is yes, according to legal experts and industry officials.
[00:31:56.025 --> 00:32:06.114]  Under the USA Patriot Act, passed a month after 9-1-1 terrorist attacks, the feds can force a non-cable TV operator to disclose every show you have watched.
[00:32:07.255 --> 00:32:16.262]  The government just has to say that their request is related to a terrorist investigation, said Jay Stanley, a technology expert for the American Civil Liberties Union.
[00:32:17.183 --> 00:32:19.365]  They also have Mr. Stanley,
[00:32:21.697 --> 00:32:26.001]  From one of the other big organizations, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, talking about it.
[00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:27.263]  But it's the cable systems, too.
[00:32:27.323 --> 00:32:32.648]  I mean, the Scientific Atlantic Cable Box, it's been out for four years, has a microphone in it, people.
[00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:34.871]  And a little bitty hole on the front.
[00:32:34.991 --> 00:32:36.312]  I've been inside the box.
[00:32:36.833 --> 00:32:38.875]  I've had one of their employees show it to me.
[00:32:39.235 --> 00:32:42.619]  Show me the manual for it that talks about the microphone.
[00:32:44.051 --> 00:32:50.416]  And by the way, the cable system doesn't sell the internet access to use the box as an interface.
[00:32:50.496 --> 00:32:51.717]  It's just there, folks.
[00:32:52.757 --> 00:32:54.018]  And no one's ever discussed it.
[00:32:55.179 --> 00:32:59.482]  And the article gets into great detail about how they're using it and how no one's discussing it.
[00:32:59.522 --> 00:33:04.166]  All we hear is how they can force librarians to give up your records or bookstores to do it.
[00:33:05.265 --> 00:33:12.735]  And it goes on in the article, the Patriot Act, which Attorney General John Ashcroft said is crucial to fighting terrorism in the United States, has scared many civil libertarians.
[00:33:13.055 --> 00:33:18.683]  However, the possibility that the feds could use the law to learn about your viewing habits has been overlooked until now.
[00:33:19.083 --> 00:33:20.946]  Well, not on this show, TV News.
[00:33:21.713 --> 00:33:27.597]  The invasion of privacy might be well-intentioned, oh yes, and perhaps even necessary, oh!
[00:33:28.017 --> 00:33:35.362]  However, there's also a danger that an overzealous team of agents will abuse the law in the spirit of the early patriots.
[00:33:35.562 --> 00:33:37.684]  All Americans need to remain vigilant.
[00:33:38.344 --> 00:33:45.709]  That's Philip Swan, President and Publisher of TVP Predictions, writing for Television News.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:56.002]  And, look, just type into a search engine your television is watching you and get ready to see AP, Reuters, UPI, MSNBC.
[00:33:57.502 --> 00:34:02.524]  We've got about a five-minute segment on it in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:34:02.544 --> 00:34:05.044]  It's two hours and forty minutes long, okay?
[00:34:05.464 --> 00:34:09.025]  Every five minutes is totally jam-packed with subjects.
[00:34:09.545 --> 00:34:11.506]  You want an overview of the New World Order?
[00:34:11.546 --> 00:34:12.846]  This is the film for you.
[00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:20.881]  You want to know about government-sponsored terrorism and 9-1-1, get The Road to Tyranny, or Masters of Terror Part 2, or my book, Dissenting to Tyranny.
[00:34:20.901 --> 00:34:24.083]  I'll give you that number later to get to that, folks.
[00:34:25.404 --> 00:34:38.975]  Again, I remember being on the air three or four years ago when MSNBC was first reporting this, and having people call on air and email me and say, you're a kook, you made it up, you're a liar.
[00:34:39.924 --> 00:34:42.309]  And I'd say, please go to InfoWars.com.
[00:34:42.369 --> 00:34:43.612]  It'd be right on the main page.
[00:34:43.952 --> 00:34:44.594]  More emails.
[00:34:44.674 --> 00:34:45.556]  I can't find it!
[00:34:45.596 --> 00:34:46.478]  You're a liar!
[00:34:46.498 --> 00:34:49.544]  I mean, anything to deny what I'm saying.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:59.730]  I've even gotten a few emails, I can't find Ron Paul's speech where he said Bush's group was founded by communists and the neocons are a bunch of big government fascists.
[00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:00.991]  I can't find it!
[00:35:01.051 --> 00:35:01.552]  Where is it?
[00:35:01.612 --> 00:35:02.993]  I don't believe Ron Paul said it!
[00:35:03.113 --> 00:35:11.242]  I mean, any way for you to stay in your box, to stay in your false reality, to deny what I'm saying on this show.
[00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.071]  Any way to do it.
[00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:19.793]  I mean, and again, it's not the liberals, it's the neocons.
[00:35:20.033 --> 00:35:34.519]  The neocon followers out there who really think Bush is a conservative and don't know that the government's growing in size, don't know the Bill of Rights is on fire, imploding, don't know our borders are wide open, don't know we're losing everything we've got.
[00:35:35.659 --> 00:35:40.001]  And you try to tell them that the digital cable boxes, and I just know about the Atlantic Scientific.
[00:35:40.041 --> 00:35:42.562]  I'm told, according to news articles, the other ones have it.
[00:35:44.013 --> 00:35:47.114]  Can watch what you watch and have microphones in them.
[00:35:47.154 --> 00:35:48.515]  Now that's a fact, people.
[00:35:48.835 --> 00:35:50.015]  Two-way microphones.
[00:35:52.356 --> 00:35:53.116]  That's a fact.
[00:35:54.056 --> 00:35:55.177]  And still you're in denial.
[00:35:56.217 --> 00:36:01.419]  I was a few weeks ago at a local radio station that carries my show.
[00:36:01.539 --> 00:36:02.339]  Great folks.
[00:36:02.359 --> 00:36:04.200]  News Talk 1260 KWNX.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:09.982]  And some of the folks there were with another station previously, so they know that I document stuff.
[00:36:10.848 --> 00:36:19.393]  One of the other employees said, Alex, I heard you the other night talking about radio frequency microchips in the goods and that the Pentagon's tied into it.
[00:36:19.693 --> 00:36:20.694]  That's ridiculous.
[00:36:20.854 --> 00:36:21.755]  I would have heard about it.
[00:36:22.135 --> 00:36:22.955]  And I said, come here.
[00:36:25.117 --> 00:36:26.698]  I said, let's go to a computer terminal.
[00:36:26.718 --> 00:36:27.878]  And the guy started laughing at me.
[00:36:27.918 --> 00:36:29.439]  And I said, come on, bet me right now.
[00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:32.701]  I'm not a betting man, but you want to lose some money to pay, you know, teach you a lesson.
[00:36:32.741 --> 00:36:33.862]  He goes, no, no, show me.
[00:36:34.597 --> 00:36:40.863]  And I went and I showed him a Washington Times article and several others that just so happened to be posted that day because we post them every day.
[00:36:40.883 --> 00:36:41.744]  There's a couple today.
[00:36:41.764 --> 00:36:43.306]  I don't know, four or five I printed.
[00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:44.467]  I don't know how many she posted.
[00:36:45.548 --> 00:36:49.852]  And I showed him the article and his mouth just dropped and he went, it's crazy!
[00:36:49.872 --> 00:36:50.213]  It's crazy!
[00:36:50.233 --> 00:36:51.514]  Yes, it's crazy!
[00:36:51.534 --> 00:36:52.115]  Okay?
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:01.482]  I mean, folks, I got a stack of government kidnapping children here, mainstream news today.
[00:37:01.822 --> 00:37:06.124]  There's so many of these articles now, I don't even cover them anymore, about 80% of the time.
[00:37:06.564 --> 00:37:08.485]  I can't stand to read the articles anymore.
[00:37:08.845 --> 00:37:10.806]  I can't stand to cover them on air anymore.
[00:37:12.766 --> 00:37:14.227]  I can't stand it anymore!
[00:37:15.888 --> 00:37:18.449]  We're living in blatant, wholesale evil.
[00:37:18.729 --> 00:37:20.790]  Folks, there's been, there's been 50,
[00:37:22.367 --> 00:37:25.868]  Four million plus abortions.
[00:37:25.968 --> 00:37:30.229]  They've killed 54 million children in this country.
[00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:34.091]  That's a gigantic evil, the biggest of them all, right out there in your face.
[00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:42.673]  So of course a government that'll do that and will brainwash the public that it's good to do, of course a government like that is going to go after a 15-year-old with a 3.84
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.981]  Who's graduating from college at 15.
[00:37:48.301 --> 00:37:53.564]  Of course CPS is trying to take her from her family and about to criminally charge the father in New York.
[00:37:54.225 --> 00:37:59.748]  Of course they want to put 12 and 15 month old babies on Prozac and Ritalin and Luvox.
[00:38:00.808 --> 00:38:05.351]  Of course they want to inject you with dangerous vaccines that attack the cerebral cortex and brain damage you.
[00:38:05.671 --> 00:38:09.393]  Of course, folks, we have their own UNESCO documents!
[00:38:10.879 --> 00:38:25.668]  So whether it's TVs that listen to you and watch you, or UNESCO saying they want to break the family up and dumb you down, and Bush signing on to it, or Bush saying he's going to sign the assault weapons ban, all of this, it's all true, it's all happening.
[00:38:25.948 --> 00:38:30.270]  The only question is, do you have the courage to research it and face the horror?
[00:38:33.432 --> 00:38:35.874]  I just, it's more evil than I thought it could be.
[00:38:36.174 --> 00:38:37.815]  I didn't understand the depths of evil.
[00:38:38.255 --> 00:38:39.476]  I'm still plumbing them.
[00:38:40.479 --> 00:38:42.440]  And yes, I'm a deep diver.
[00:38:43.341 --> 00:38:44.482]  And yes, I've faced it.
[00:38:44.862 --> 00:38:46.863]  I have faced the Matrix, folks.
[00:38:46.983 --> 00:38:48.845]  It is horrifying.
[00:38:49.645 --> 00:38:52.467]  The horror is that more of you aren't waking up quick enough.
[00:38:52.487 --> 00:38:54.729]  Let's just take some calls.
[00:38:54.769 --> 00:38:55.889]  I'll get back into other news.
[00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.891]  Ed in Canada.
[00:38:57.931 --> 00:38:58.671]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:38:59.452 --> 00:39:02.794]  I'm one of your dissidents, so I hope you don't cut me off.
[00:39:03.114 --> 00:39:03.735]  Now, go ahead.
[00:39:03.815 --> 00:39:06.637]  You know, I'm a Canadian who supports the U.S.
[00:39:06.697 --> 00:39:08.538]  troops and the war in Iraq.
[00:39:10.635 --> 00:39:16.961]  Lots of Canadians are in favor of it and we're not a bunch of cowards.
[00:39:17.901 --> 00:39:19.883]  We did it in Vietnam also.
[00:39:20.083 --> 00:39:28.591]  You know when your draft Dodgers came up here by the thousands, thousands of Canadians volunteered to fight in Vietnam and they didn't have to.
[00:39:29.351 --> 00:39:30.032]  Did you know that?
[00:39:31.373 --> 00:39:34.936]  They joined the US Army and the Marines and they fought in Vietnam.
[00:39:36.137 --> 00:39:38.079]  And here, when I listen to you
[00:39:38.717 --> 00:39:42.063]  To you twisting and manipulating the news every morning.
[00:39:42.083 --> 00:39:47.853]  For instance, the biggest news story this morning was the killing of Saddam's son.
[00:39:48.394 --> 00:39:49.476]  Oh, that was coming up.
[00:39:50.259 --> 00:39:54.583]  So you apparently haven't heard about that, or you don't want to hear about it?
[00:39:54.603 --> 00:39:56.084]  No, thank you for reminding me.
[00:39:56.164 --> 00:39:57.625]  It's right here in front of me.
[00:39:57.645 --> 00:40:00.287]  In fact, it was two stories down.
[00:40:00.327 --> 00:40:02.349]  I would have gotten to it before the hour ended.
[00:40:02.369 --> 00:40:03.870]  Well, that was the biggest story.
[00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:05.751]  You took quite a time to get to it.
[00:40:06.532 --> 00:40:07.733]  One of these guys is a serial rapist.
[00:40:07.793 --> 00:40:08.474]  Well, hold on.
[00:40:08.514 --> 00:40:09.414]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:40:09.434 --> 00:40:11.916]  The other one is a mass murderer.
[00:40:11.936 --> 00:40:12.197]  Hey!
[00:40:12.357 --> 00:40:12.977]  Put him on hold.
[00:40:13.017 --> 00:40:14.398]  Don't hang up, okay, weasel?
[00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:18.662]  Let me counter what you're saying piece by piece here, okay?
[00:40:19.242 --> 00:40:24.603]  Let me counter it piece by piece, because you can make an accusation and I'm going to counter it at that point.
[00:40:25.884 --> 00:40:40.107]  Ron Paul, who served, what is it, two tours in Vietnam as a flight surgeon, okay, front line, Ron Paul says the war is wrong and says it's a fraud.
[00:40:41.269 --> 00:40:46.852]  Now, I don't know about Mr. Bush, who only spent a year at the National Guard and then went AWOL.
[00:40:47.352 --> 00:40:51.255]  I don't know about the rest of his cabinet, who are all either draft-dodgers or got deferments.
[00:40:52.095 --> 00:40:53.396]  Now, let's counter that first.
[00:40:53.616 --> 00:40:54.296]  Number two.
[00:40:55.217 --> 00:41:01.500]  Number two, he went off into this whole diatribe about how I didn't talk about Saddam Hussein's sons.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.982]  Well, I guess I'm cursed with something.
[00:41:04.022 --> 00:41:05.182]  I have a long-term memory.
[00:41:06.343 --> 00:41:08.484]  They claim they killed Chemical Ali.
[00:41:08.904 --> 00:41:10.085]  Nice little name they give him.
[00:41:11.801 --> 00:41:13.502]  And, uh, it turns out they didn't.
[00:41:13.982 --> 00:41:19.625]  They claimed that they killed Saddam, not once, not twice, but three separate times, and then said he was alive again.
[00:41:20.045 --> 00:41:23.346]  Because they know you need little mindless victories, so they give you false ones.
[00:41:23.426 --> 00:41:26.548]  Oh, we finally got Goldstein, and then Goldstein's back.
[00:41:26.588 --> 00:41:27.948]  That's a 1984 illusion.
[00:41:29.469 --> 00:41:30.569]  I'm alluding to that, excuse me.
[00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:31.970]  Not an illusion, I'm alluding to it.
[00:41:33.364 --> 00:41:41.191]  This whole thing about, oh, they had a firefight and killed four people and they're sure that they killed these guys.
[00:41:42.112 --> 00:41:51.140]  I happen to remember Rumsfeld saying, a week before the war, they paid off the Iraqi leadership and they were going to lay down their arms, which they did, and their leadership was flown out on jet aircraft.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:57.405]  And according to the Russian and Iranian news, they were flown out to safety in Russia.
[00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:03.028]  And Saddam Hussein was hired in 1958, according to Congressional record, by Republicans, by the CIA.
[00:42:03.188 --> 00:42:05.091]  He's been working for them all along.
[00:42:05.492 --> 00:42:09.618]  8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda were flown out to safety when Kandahar was about to fall.
[00:42:10.018 --> 00:42:11.020]  That was a staged war.
[00:42:11.884 --> 00:42:16.345]  And, uh, so don't sit here and claim that we're liberal socialists here because we're against your phony war.
[00:42:16.805 --> 00:42:22.846]  Ron Paul has the most conservative record, not rhetoric, record, and he's against your phony war.
[00:42:23.146 --> 00:42:24.286]  Now what do you say to that, buddy?
[00:42:24.846 --> 00:42:26.167]  Alex, can I say something now?
[00:42:26.467 --> 00:42:27.267]  Yeah, well, no, no, no.
[00:42:27.327 --> 00:42:28.567]  You answer my questions.
[00:42:28.847 --> 00:42:29.867]  What about Ron Paul?
[00:42:29.927 --> 00:42:32.288]  He has a record, not a rhetoric.
[00:42:32.528 --> 00:42:33.228]  Now what do you say?
[00:42:33.248 --> 00:42:36.309]  Are you calling him... I heard his speech about neocon.
[00:42:37.049 --> 00:42:37.389]  Okay?
[00:42:37.729 --> 00:42:38.529]  How about yesterday?
[00:42:39.899 --> 00:42:41.120]  Yeah, everything's connected.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.622]  We're talking about reality here.
[00:42:43.862 --> 00:42:46.324]  Now, is he a draft-dodging liberal because he's against the war?
[00:42:47.265 --> 00:42:48.466]  I'm talking about you!
[00:42:48.486 --> 00:42:50.528]  Did you ever... Did you serve the military?
[00:42:50.828 --> 00:42:51.788]  No, I didn't.
[00:42:51.809 --> 00:42:53.790]  And let me give you another little news tip here.
[00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:57.213]  I'm not going to go serve under the UN, and I'm not going to serve in these corporate wars.
[00:42:57.873 --> 00:43:07.641]  And they've got $100 billion to $200 billion funding mercenary armies, and they're hiring illegal aliens with criminal records now, like Stalin did.
[00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:09.851]  Anyway, I was talking about... Hey!
[00:43:10.051 --> 00:43:10.291]  Hey!
[00:43:10.471 --> 00:43:10.771]  Hey!
[00:43:11.051 --> 00:43:12.112]  This is not... Hey!
[00:43:12.772 --> 00:43:14.714]  This is not a two-year-old discussion.
[00:43:15.174 --> 00:43:18.676]  I'm telling you, the most conservative member of Congress says the war's wrong.
[00:43:18.936 --> 00:43:22.658]  So don't... So don't say you don't want to discuss that, and then call me a liberal.
[00:43:23.158 --> 00:43:26.020]  Lots of people say the war is wrong, and others don't.
[00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:27.641]  Okay.
[00:43:28.453 --> 00:43:31.837]  Well, as usual, you can't, you don't have any counterpoints, Neocon.
[00:43:32.357 --> 00:43:34.339]  Getting to the Saddam matter here.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:39.124]  You told us that Saddam and his gang were thrown out with millions in gold.
[00:43:39.525 --> 00:43:41.206]  And now here they are in Baghdad.
[00:43:41.647 --> 00:43:42.428]  Two of them dead.
[00:43:43.896 --> 00:43:49.899]  Have you noticed the approval rating drops and suddenly they claim... Now, which time did they kill Saddam?
[00:43:50.099 --> 00:43:52.760]  They claim they killed Saddam and his sons three other times.
[00:43:53.161 --> 00:43:55.462]  And then later, a month later, quietly said it wasn't true.
[00:43:55.702 --> 00:43:57.223]  So I'm supposed to believe it this time?
[00:43:57.703 --> 00:43:59.264]  Well, this time they have the bodies.
[00:43:59.844 --> 00:44:00.845]  Oh, sure they do!
[00:44:00.865 --> 00:44:05.768]  When you drop a bomb on a building, you can never be sure if you killed the person.
[00:44:05.808 --> 00:44:10.010]  But what about... So, now... So the government doesn't lie to us?
[00:44:11.866 --> 00:44:14.530]  What about the Pentagon Office of Strategic Information?
[00:44:14.591 --> 00:44:17.195]  They said they would lie to us last year in a major report.
[00:44:18.557 --> 00:44:24.106]  You know, that whole Pentagon 9-1-1 story, which you claim never happened the way it did.
[00:44:24.647 --> 00:44:25.368]  I never did that.
[00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:25.969]  Yeah.
[00:44:26.815 --> 00:44:27.395]  I never did that.
[00:44:27.455 --> 00:44:29.216]  I said all of them were remote-controlled.
[00:44:29.756 --> 00:44:33.417]  All remote-controlled, yeah.
[00:44:33.617 --> 00:44:35.297]  Yeah, and over 300 former top U.S.
[00:44:35.357 --> 00:44:41.419]  generals and others met in Portugal for a 76-hour news conference last year and laid it all out.
[00:44:41.879 --> 00:44:45.480]  Yeah, well, you sure did a good whitewash on these Islamic beasts.
[00:44:46.024 --> 00:44:47.885]  Well, he murdered 3,000 Americans.
[00:44:48.105 --> 00:44:49.785]  He did the whitewash on them.
[00:44:49.845 --> 00:44:56.387]  Oh, you mean the ones that FBI informants and agents lived with and paid for their houses and their cars and their credit cards and they trained at U.S.
[00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:59.708]  bases and all the public officials that got told not to fly that day?
[00:45:00.108 --> 00:45:02.969]  Or the CIA that put put options in on American and United?
[00:45:03.269 --> 00:45:04.590]  Or maybe you're talking about the U.S.
[00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:06.590]  troops massing into Zikustan or Uzbekistan?
[00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:10.472]  Or maybe PNAC calling for terrorist attacks to get us behind the New World Order?
[00:45:10.612 --> 00:45:11.532]  You talking about all that?
[00:45:11.872 --> 00:45:15.896]  And how about all those Canadian troops that have invaded the United States?
[00:45:16.056 --> 00:45:18.458]  Oh, you're talking about... Oh, you're talking about... Now, wait a minute.
[00:45:18.478 --> 00:45:21.300]  What about your Canadian troops that got bombed by the speed freaks?
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.263]  We don't have any Canadian troops in your country.
[00:45:24.503 --> 00:45:26.445]  We don't even have any to protect Canada.
[00:45:26.465 --> 00:45:30.288]  That was an official story of the CBC and the Associated Press.
[00:45:30.628 --> 00:45:34.832]  They signed the deal last year to bring in foreign troops to, quote, deal with American terrorists.
[00:45:34.892 --> 00:45:36.553]  Oh, there are no Canadians there.
[00:45:36.573 --> 00:45:37.454]  Again, that's not true either.
[00:45:37.674 --> 00:45:42.362]  Hey, I suppose you think it's not true that the cable boxes have microphones and are hooked into the government?
[00:45:43.944 --> 00:45:44.766]  I suppose that's a lie too.
[00:45:44.786 --> 00:45:45.487]  Not here they don't.
[00:45:45.988 --> 00:45:46.348]  Pardon me?
[00:45:46.669 --> 00:45:47.570]  Not here they don't.
[00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:48.652]  Oh, I'm sure they don't.
[00:45:48.752 --> 00:45:49.714]  Yeah, right.
[00:45:50.535 --> 00:45:52.238]  And you haven't checked it out, you just say that.
[00:45:53.553 --> 00:45:57.534]  Well, listen, that talk show host who cut you off, he was right.
[00:45:57.834 --> 00:45:59.475]  You're just, you hate America.
[00:45:59.515 --> 00:46:01.056]  You're a traitor and a coward.
[00:46:01.116 --> 00:46:01.856]  That's what you are.
[00:46:01.876 --> 00:46:02.656]  Oh, sure I am.
[00:46:02.736 --> 00:46:05.357]  Oh, yeah, what I'm doing is very cowardly.
[00:46:05.757 --> 00:46:06.998]  You hate your country.
[00:46:07.058 --> 00:46:09.578]  Yeah, going up against the New World Order, it's very cowardly.
[00:46:09.618 --> 00:46:10.619]  The New World Order.
[00:46:10.719 --> 00:46:14.740]  I've heard about the New World Order 20 years ago from Tex Mars.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.261]  I had every one of his books.
[00:46:16.721 --> 00:46:18.081]  You know what I did recently?
[00:46:18.181 --> 00:46:20.002]  I threw them all in the trash can.
[00:46:20.122 --> 00:46:22.883]  Well, Tex Mars wasn't writing books about the New World Order 20 years ago.
[00:46:24.304 --> 00:46:30.668]  Tex Mars was an officer in the Air Force writing military policy books.
[00:46:32.369 --> 00:46:35.010]  And a space and aeronautics professor at the University of Texas.
[00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:38.312]  I listened to Tex Mars before you ever came on the air.
[00:46:38.552 --> 00:46:38.972]  15 years ago.
[00:46:38.992 --> 00:46:40.133]  Tex is a good friend of mine.
[00:46:40.173 --> 00:46:43.575]  He married me and my wife and I've had dinner with him and go to his church.
[00:46:43.615 --> 00:46:45.236]  I read every one of his books.
[00:46:45.962 --> 00:46:48.364]  And I finally decided to... And it's all come true!
[00:46:48.404 --> 00:46:49.344]  And it's all come true!
[00:46:49.585 --> 00:46:50.565]  And you're the coward!
[00:46:50.786 --> 00:46:55.109]  You're so afraid of this New World Order, you're just going to deny it because you can't face the horror!
[00:46:56.029 --> 00:46:58.751]  I guess Tex Marr is the Vietnam veteran.
[00:46:58.771 --> 00:46:59.772]  I guess he's a coward too.
[00:46:59.812 --> 00:47:00.232]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:00.252 --> 00:47:01.913]  I'll tell you what the New World Order is.
[00:47:02.314 --> 00:47:04.135]  It's the Islamic World Order.
[00:47:04.195 --> 00:47:05.956]  They're going to take over the world!
[00:47:06.697 --> 00:47:08.138]  Well, the Globalist are funding them.
[00:47:08.178 --> 00:47:09.319]  That's probably a big part of it.
[00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:09.999]  Yes, you're right.
[00:47:10.059 --> 00:47:11.320]  Europe's going to use the Muslims.
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.681]  Boy, you're correct on that.
[00:47:12.741 --> 00:47:13.722]  Wow, you said something true.
[00:47:15.618 --> 00:47:16.659]  Thanks a lot for the call.
[00:47:17.659 --> 00:47:19.181]  Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:19.201 --> 00:47:20.822]  You're welcome to call back anytime, Ed.
[00:47:22.043 --> 00:47:24.004]  And I called you one name, you called me about ten.
[00:47:24.064 --> 00:47:25.445]  I apologize for calling you a name.
[00:47:25.505 --> 00:47:28.167]  I just... It's hard to deal with, folks.
[00:47:28.587 --> 00:47:31.269]  You notice the compartmentalized thinking and mindset there.
[00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:34.491]  He could not focus in on key points.
[00:47:34.531 --> 00:47:37.773]  He had to just name call and have an emotional spasm.
[00:47:39.715 --> 00:47:41.016]  An emotional spasm.
[00:47:41.976 --> 00:47:44.078]  And his cable boxes, they don't have microphones.
[00:47:46.355 --> 00:47:46.775]  Oh boy.
[00:47:47.175 --> 00:47:47.695]  Oh man.
[00:47:48.576 --> 00:47:57.898]  By the way, the former head of the Army who was studying radiological events said in 91 our troops were sick and dying from DU and it's deadly.
[00:47:58.279 --> 00:48:00.059]  He's saying he's tested their blood again.
[00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:02.200]  British, Australian and U.S.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.000]  They have it again.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.260]  They're already coming down ill.
[00:48:05.201 --> 00:48:09.482]  They were hit with Seren VX in the first Gulf War University of Texas Medical Center report.
[00:48:09.502 --> 00:48:12.863]  A lot of them have died and they weren't given treatment.
[00:48:13.564 --> 00:48:17.687]  Our government's stolen the stuff, but, uh, I know I don't support the Tribs because I try to save them.
[00:48:18.408 --> 00:48:23.192]  I understand how your sick logic works, and... God forgive you, because you don't know what you do.
[00:48:23.212 --> 00:48:24.713]  You've been blinded by this system.
[00:48:25.474 --> 00:48:28.056]  If it was possible, even the elect would be deceived, and they have.
[00:48:28.696 --> 00:48:29.337]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:31.272 --> 00:48:33.053]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:48:33.233 --> 00:48:33.833]  I mean real!
[00:48:34.033 --> 00:48:38.876]  Hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:48:39.196 --> 00:48:40.056]  Probably never, right?
[00:48:40.336 --> 00:48:43.378]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.
[00:48:43.658 --> 00:48:46.099]  He's the owner and founder of the Cal Bend Soap Company.

[00:49:31.824 --> 00:49:35.606]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and
[00:49:36.653 --> 00:49:40.758]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:41.038 --> 00:49:41.598]  We listened.
[00:49:41.899 --> 00:49:46.904]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:47.165 --> 00:49:47.645]  We listened.
[00:49:48.025 --> 00:49:51.069]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:52.010]  We listened.
[00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:56.553]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:49:56.934 --> 00:49:57.414]  We listened.
[00:49:57.754 --> 00:50:02.998]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:50:03.418 --> 00:50:04.779]  Again, we listened.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:12.525]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:50:12.905 --> 00:50:17.329]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at
[00:50:25.055 --> 00:50:38.362]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:50:38.622 --> 00:50:43.365]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:50:43.585 --> 00:50:49.228]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:50:49.468 --> 00:50:50.189]  We're good to go.
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:05.921]  And much, much more.
[00:51:06.081 --> 00:51:08.603]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:51:08.823 --> 00:51:15.588]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:15.769 --> 00:51:21.033]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:21.053 --> 00:51:21.453]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:40.368 --> 00:51:44.693]  And that guy comes out and attacks a veteran like Tex Mars.
[00:51:45.794 --> 00:51:47.456]  By the way, Tex made his money.
[00:51:49.438 --> 00:51:57.888]  His best sellers were defense policy books, premier books on robotics, test booklets for the military.
[00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:59.630]  He wrote a lot of those.
[00:52:01.091 --> 00:52:01.572]  That's where
[00:52:02.651 --> 00:52:15.541]  Tex got involved and learned about the New World Order, was doing stuff for the Pentagon, and as a professor, then he broke away from that and wrote books about the New World Order, I guess starting about 12 years ago, wait, 14 years ago.
[00:52:15.561 --> 00:52:17.722]  So go ahead and attack Tex Marsh.
[00:52:17.962 --> 00:52:19.984]  Go ahead and attack Ron Paul, Vietnam veteran.
[00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:22.326]  Go ahead and attack real patriots.
[00:52:25.028 --> 00:52:26.589]  Who's our caller from Pennsylvania, Mark?
[00:52:28.169 --> 00:52:29.050]  Darryl, you're on the air.
[00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:29.411]  Go ahead.
[00:52:29.431 --> 00:52:31.454]  Would you like to say anything to our last caller?
[00:52:31.714 --> 00:52:32.255]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:52:32.375 --> 00:52:34.798]  I'm a 20-year military veteran and
[00:52:35.529 --> 00:52:36.789]  I'm not going to call him any names.
[00:52:36.989 --> 00:52:41.071]  I would assume he's either grossly ignorant and or he's in total denial.
[00:52:41.411 --> 00:52:44.232]  I think it was total denial because he says he was aware of this.
[00:52:44.292 --> 00:52:48.033]  I think it was so scary he shifted over and went ahead and joined the enemy.
[00:52:48.593 --> 00:52:49.813]  That's happened a lot in wars.
[00:52:49.853 --> 00:52:52.854]  When Benedict Arnold thought they were going to lose, he shifted over.
[00:52:53.674 --> 00:52:55.235]  Look, I am fighting for this country.
[00:52:55.615 --> 00:53:00.497]  I am in the cause for the Republic here in the homeland against the enemy combatants.
[00:53:00.937 --> 00:53:05.238]  My guess is he's both grossly ignorant and or in total denial.
[00:53:06.032 --> 00:53:11.636]  I'm a 20-year military veteran, and to ask whether someone was in the service or not is a moot point.
[00:53:12.096 --> 00:53:25.945]  The fact of the matter is, I think you agree with what I'm going to say here right now, and that is that the vast majority of the wars we fought in the 20th century had nothing to do with American security or anything in the best interest of the American people.
[00:53:25.965 --> 00:53:28.287]  What about the Marine Corps General who wrote a book about it?
[00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:30.109]  Exactly.
[00:53:30.389 --> 00:53:40.033]  You've had General Walt and other top military guys, plus I know the guy you're talking about is Fedley D. Butler, who was a double Congressional Medal of Honor recipient.
[00:53:40.093 --> 00:53:41.053]  War is a rocket.
[00:53:41.353 --> 00:53:41.933]  Exactly.
[00:53:42.173 --> 00:53:46.255]  And we've basically fought for corporate interests, oil interests,
[00:53:47.234 --> 00:53:51.958]  The fruit companies and... Yeah, nerve gassing and making our troops huff DU.
[00:53:52.038 --> 00:53:53.099]  That's not patriotic.
[00:53:53.159 --> 00:53:53.660]  I'm sorry.
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.543]  And let me just give you a couple figures here, Alex, and you're aware of this.
[00:53:57.643 --> 00:54:01.106]  In the Korean War, we left behind 7,190 POWs.
[00:54:01.367 --> 00:54:04.389]  We left 21,000 behind as Stalin.
[00:54:04.429 --> 00:54:05.270]  That's admitted fact.
[00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:05.831]  Exactly.
[00:54:05.871 --> 00:54:09.674]  Some people say up to 25,000 that the Soviet Army liberated in general.
[00:54:09.694 --> 00:54:11.916]  Confirmed number is 21,000, but yeah, it's probably higher.
[00:54:12.518 --> 00:54:20.924]  And we had 8,000 MIA from the Korean War, and of those 7,000, over 7,000 POWs, only 4,000 were repatriated.
[00:54:20.944 --> 00:54:24.787]  But wait, we have the official document.
[00:54:24.827 --> 00:54:26.248]  I had the lawyers on last year.
[00:54:26.308 --> 00:54:29.290]  This is mainstream news, New York Daily News, Scotsman is well reported.
[00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:33.193]  It's on in fullwords.com, where Roosevelt knowingly
[00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:40.494]  Left 7,000 women and children in the Philippines, quote, to be captured because that would, quote, be good propaganda tool.
[00:54:40.554 --> 00:54:43.075]  I mean, these people are cold-blooded, folks.
[00:54:43.355 --> 00:54:46.837]  And in Vietnam, over 2,400 POW MIAs.
[00:54:47.257 --> 00:54:49.779]  And Alex, it's not just the MIA POW issue.
[00:54:49.839 --> 00:54:54.081]  As you've brought out on your program quite frequently, we had Agent Orange... Hold on, stay there.
[00:54:54.121 --> 00:54:58.143]  I'm gonna let you finish up, Daryl, and we'll go to Dave, Jeff, Rambo, Ken, and others.
[00:54:58.183 --> 00:54:59.744]  We got George Humphreys coming up.
[00:54:59.784 --> 00:55:00.184]  Stay there.
[00:55:00.224 --> 00:55:01.245]  I'll come back to you in the next hour.
[00:55:02.631 --> 00:55:24.115]  Folks, if you want to counter these people, if you want to blow these neocons' minds, and unlock their brains, and get the blinders off their eyes, and the plugs out of their ears, and the gags out of their mouths, get 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, America Destroyed by Design, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, My Book The Sentence to Tyranny.

[00:56:18.287 --> 00:56:20.509]  We'll be right back with a second hour of your calls in George Humphrey.
[00:56:23.471 --> 00:56:27.113]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[00:56:27.253 --> 00:56:31.636]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[00:56:31.816 --> 00:56:32.417]  The Aeronizer.
[00:56:36.525 --> 00:56:39.746]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:47.970]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:49.710]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.391 --> 00:56:51.531]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.551 --> 00:56:52.972]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.732 --> 00:56:54.652]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.293 --> 00:56:59.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.474 --> 00:57:03.556]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.131 --> 00:57:09.174]  The political process is designed to switch off your thinking process.
[00:57:10.595 --> 00:57:18.781]  The left-right paradigm is phony, and I just got called a liberal in the last hour because I support Ron Paul, the most conservative member of Congress, against the phony wars.
[00:57:20.122 --> 00:57:24.224]  Daryl in Pennsylvania, go ahead and finish up, and we'll go to Dave, Jeff, Rambo, Ken, and others.
[00:57:24.264 --> 00:57:24.865]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:57:24.985 --> 00:57:29.348]  Yeah, I just want to say how they treat America's fighting men after the wars.
[00:57:29.888 --> 00:57:31.970]  They treat them like disposable diapers.
[00:57:32.766 --> 00:57:50.599]  Not just the POWMIA issue, and Alex, when I went through survival training, I flew hazardous duty missions against the Soviet Union and other communist countries, and they told us in that survival training, if you guys ever get shot down over enemy territory, we will leave no stone unturned.
[00:57:50.679 --> 00:57:58.765]  We will get you out, we'll extract you out, no matter if they stick you in the middle of the Soviet Union, we'll come in with special forces and get you out.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:07.825]  And Alex, after I got out of the military, after 20 years, I found out not only, like I said, Korea, Vietnam, World War II, how they left our men behind.
[00:58:07.925 --> 00:58:09.106]  They knew they were there.
[00:58:09.446 --> 00:58:11.407]  They knew they were being tortured to death.
[00:58:11.447 --> 00:58:14.189]  They knew they were having medical... But isn't that patriotic?
[00:58:14.289 --> 00:58:16.690]  Isn't really supporting the troops not patriotic?
[00:58:17.251 --> 00:58:17.511]  Right.
[00:58:17.591 --> 00:58:25.716]  Working them to death, digging in salt mines, uranium mines, digging canals up around Leningrad.
[00:58:26.618 --> 00:58:39.088]  Being taken to special hospitals in North Korea and China, where the Czechs had built the hospitals, and where they experimented cutting off totally healthy legs and arms, just to see how they work.
[00:58:39.388 --> 00:58:52.258]  Doing biological, chemical, and radiation testing on our men, and our intercepts by our national intelligence community knew about this, knew they were moving the men around, had actual
[00:58:52.737 --> 00:58:59.802]  Intercept of this and then we were told by Kissinger and Nixon and others, all of our troops are accounted for.
[00:58:59.822 --> 00:59:01.243]  So the lies just go on.
[00:59:01.623 --> 00:59:04.025]  The Agent Orange, the Gulf War Illness No.
[00:59:04.045 --> 00:59:08.488]  1 and now Gulf War Illness 2, where they let our men die.
[00:59:08.648 --> 00:59:11.029]  Well, according to the neocons, that's patriotism.
[00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:12.971]  Yeah, give them Prozac and other things.
[00:59:13.071 --> 00:59:15.252]  It's all in their head, don't you know, and up to between $25,000 to
[00:59:16.713 --> 00:59:19.876]  Conservatively, to 40,000 of our guys dead from Gulf War.
[00:59:20.036 --> 00:59:24.520]  Well, that's major universities that have done autopsies and found the Sarin VX in their brain stems.
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.381]  But, you know what?
[00:59:25.661 --> 00:59:26.622]  You're not a patriot.
[00:59:26.902 --> 00:59:27.683]  You're a coward.
[00:59:28.043 --> 00:59:30.505]  Leaving our troops behind, nerve-gassing them is good.
[00:59:30.665 --> 00:59:31.506]  I'm a neocon.
[00:59:31.846 --> 00:59:36.170]  And VA stringing out claims until the guys die, like they did on Agent Orange.
[00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:43.296]  And then, as you pointed out recently, how they promised all the troops every time when you'd re-enlist, oh, you'll have medical treatment.
[00:59:43.706 --> 00:59:44.427]  I don't know.
[01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:16.703]  Fight, thinking they're doing for the right causes, and be totally betrayed by the government, the VA, and even at the top levels, the VFW and the American Legion have been co-opted.
[01:00:16.763 --> 01:00:27.093]  And Alex, it's just a crying shame, but you are 100% patriotic, and anyone else that opposes a phony war, that's true patriotism.
[01:00:27.796 --> 01:00:49.328]  False patriotism is stupidly waving a flag made in China and rallying behind the President as if he's the head of the football team, the quarterback or something that's going to lead us to victory when we're going in and bombing the heck out of countries that are no threat to the United States, such as Serbia.
[01:00:50.181 --> 01:00:55.866]  Well, we now have the White House Energy Commission's documents getting ready for the Iraq War, divvying up the oil.
[01:00:55.906 --> 01:00:57.307]  I mean, this is all official.
[01:00:57.547 --> 01:01:00.730]  And then calling Tex Marsh, saying he threw away all his books.
[01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:07.255]  I have all of Tex's books that he wrote on the New World Order and the New Age, and everything that Tex has said has come true.
[01:01:07.295 --> 01:01:10.498]  So, this guy, he's living in la-la land.
[01:01:10.538 --> 01:01:17.764]  And I just want to thank you and Violet and everyone there, Alex, that you had the guts to stand up and tell the truth about phony patriotism.
[01:01:18.537 --> 01:01:21.058]  So, God bless you and thank you so much for taking my call.
[01:01:21.639 --> 01:01:22.379]  Alright, thank you.
[01:01:22.399 --> 01:01:25.260]  Well, he said it was cowardly that I'm plotting the New World Order.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.442]  You know, it's very safe to do this for a national talk show host.
[01:01:30.123 --> 01:01:31.343]  Just ask Dr. Kelly.
[01:01:31.423 --> 01:01:32.424]  It was very good for him.
[01:01:33.084 --> 01:01:36.125]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:38.286]  I'm George Humphrey.
[01:01:38.306 --> 01:01:39.067]  Stay with me.
[01:01:39.107 --> 01:01:39.587]  End your calls.
[01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:47.013]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:01:47.253 --> 01:01:52.677]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:01:52.977 --> 01:02:03.324]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:02:03.504 --> 01:02:07.847]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:02:08.027 --> 01:02:16.410]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:23.032]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and final tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:02:23.132 --> 01:02:27.613]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[01:02:41.477 --> 01:02:47.079]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:47.259 --> 01:02:51.681]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:51.821 --> 01:02:56.182]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:02:56.242 --> 01:02:57.563]  The New World Order.

[01:04:39.651 --> 01:04:47.395]  My good friend George Humphrey, former city council member, successful businessman, author, researcher, good friend of mine, joins us
[01:05:06.204 --> 01:05:08.566]  And then we've got Dave, Jeff, Rambo, Ken and others.
[01:05:08.586 --> 01:05:10.347]  I'm going to get to you here in the next 10-15 minutes.
[01:05:11.348 --> 01:05:29.521]  And George is going to ride shotgun with us today and we're going to bounce back and forth different news articles and get his take on it and talk about the New World Order and his new book that he has come out with, 9-1-1, The Great Deception, The Illuminati End Game, Your Choice, Love or Fear.
[01:05:31.036 --> 01:05:39.085]  And it's an incredibly professionally produced audio and tape CD set over three hours long and a little 70-page color booklet.
[01:05:39.105 --> 01:05:40.127]  Well, it's not little at all.
[01:05:40.187 --> 01:05:41.768]  It's concentrated info.
[01:05:42.409 --> 01:05:43.751]  And yes, I'm offering it.
[01:05:43.811 --> 01:05:45.833]  Yes, I carry his other two books on tape.
[01:05:46.374 --> 01:05:47.895]  And this one, I think, is the best.
[01:05:47.975 --> 01:05:51.680]  And it's now on InfoWars.com for those that just joined us.
[01:05:53.389 --> 01:05:56.430]  Coming up again in a few minutes, Dave, Jeff, Rambo, Ken and many others.
[01:05:57.010 --> 01:05:58.831]  George, I know you can tune into the show.
[01:05:58.851 --> 01:05:59.671]  I know you listen quite a bit.
[01:05:59.691 --> 01:06:05.113]  Did you hear the guy in the last hour say that I'm not patriotic because I'm not for invading all these countries?
[01:06:06.174 --> 01:06:09.675]  Alex, first of all, it's good to hear your voice and good to talk to you this morning.
[01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:17.137]  And Alex, you and I both have been charged several times with not being patriotic.
[01:06:17.958 --> 01:06:21.359]  And after a while, when you first hear it,
[01:06:23.043 --> 01:06:27.824]  It's frustrating, it makes you angry, but then after a while, it's almost funny.
[01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:42.868]  These people have no sense of imagination, they have no intelligence, and it is just absolutely amazing that these people in their ignorance restore to such juvenile
[01:06:43.493 --> 01:06:45.873]  In an inaccurate accusation.
[01:06:46.034 --> 01:06:56.316]  And so, what we're actually doing is that when people respond like this, I think that most of your listeners will realize how far off base they are.
[01:06:56.756 --> 01:07:01.717]  And all we can do is kind of chuckle and respond.
[01:07:01.737 --> 01:07:03.317]  Well, they do it because of fear.
[01:07:03.397 --> 01:07:04.737]  Deep down, they know the truth.
[01:07:04.777 --> 01:07:05.817]  They're afraid, George.
[01:07:05.977 --> 01:07:08.978]  They're incredibly afraid, because you know what?
[01:07:10.012 --> 01:07:34.658]  Not only are we right on a spiritual level, but on a third-dimensional, just factual, objective basis, point after point after point, we have showed that the power elite, the Illuminati, whatever you want to call them, are psychopathic degenerates, that they have absolute control of our financial economic systems, they have control of our cultural outlets, they have control of both political parties,
[01:07:35.265 --> 01:07:44.329]  And they are moving us, at light warp speed, toward a police state and the destruction of our Constitution.
[01:07:45.669 --> 01:07:46.890]  You're absolutely right, George.
[01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:55.633]  And you know, and the fact is, is that you and others across the country, we are getting out the information on a daily basis.
[01:07:56.093 --> 01:07:58.854]  And the people of this country are starting to listen.
[01:07:59.274 --> 01:08:03.016]  And it's amazing, all over the country, ten years ago when I talked about this,
[01:08:03.855 --> 01:08:04.716]  Nobody would listen.
[01:08:05.076 --> 01:08:10.120]  And today, wherever I go, and I'm sure wherever you go, people come up to us and talk to us.
[01:08:10.881 --> 01:08:21.730]  And this is the start of the second American Revolution to restore our constitutional republic, to restore justice, to restore truth.
[01:08:22.210 --> 01:08:25.313]  And that's why I am so honored to be on your show today.
[01:08:25.333 --> 01:08:27.214]  Well, George, I'm honored to have you here.
[01:08:28.909 --> 01:08:39.590]  I mean, the level of evil, and the more I study the New World Order, the deeper down the rabbit hole I go, the deeper I dive, the more painful it is to admit the truth, but...
[01:08:41.161 --> 01:08:51.506]  I'm more alive than I've ever been, and I have a mission, and my humanity has been activated, my desire to warn people to this incredible threat.
[01:08:51.546 --> 01:08:52.146]  It's all around us.
[01:08:52.166 --> 01:09:02.591]  I mean, in the last hour, George, I read a television news, that's the name of the news service, story admitting under Patriot Act the digital cable systems are watching what we watch.
[01:09:02.611 --> 01:09:04.032]  They've got microphones in them.
[01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:05.873]  This is admitted right here in Austin.
[01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:09.515]  Microphones in the Atlantic Scientific black cable boxes.
[01:09:10.756 --> 01:09:17.039]  They admit the troops are sick and dying from DU, the Army's former chief is, but the average person has no idea.
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:25.144]  They're slaughtering the Bill of Rights and Constitution, the borders are wide open, the government's involved in evil that's just unimaginable.
[01:09:25.524 --> 01:09:31.708]  We're being hit on a thousand different fronts, but you're right, the awakening, the renaissance has begun.
[01:09:31.808 --> 01:09:36.131]  I mean, eight years ago on the radio here in Austin, I could load the phones with people that disagree.
[01:09:37.202 --> 01:09:39.725]  Now on a syndicated show, we don't screen the calls.
[01:09:39.845 --> 01:09:40.926]  It's a rarity.
[01:09:41.527 --> 01:09:56.542]  Maybe once a month somebody calls in who's mindless and disagrees because the thinkers, the real patriots and real conservatives are waking up and the liberals, we're waking them up that their control paradigm was false and controlled because we're not hypocrites.
[01:09:56.842 --> 01:09:58.244]  We expose the entire system.
[01:09:59.044 --> 01:10:04.809]  They're going out and buying guns and educating people and becoming freedom lovers.
[01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:07.932]  We're breaking the false left-right paradigm.
[01:10:08.552 --> 01:10:12.796]  And now I love the phones and everybody agrees and has cogent, intelligent points to make.
[01:10:13.196 --> 01:10:16.279]  I was at the grocery store last night.
[01:10:17.037 --> 01:10:45.406]  uh... waiting for some uh... food uh... there's a little restaurant to be prepared and i probably had twenty people come by my table and say you're right and they were people in business suits and hippies with long hair and young women and old women and blacks and whites and indians i mean this is happening and we we have the momentum and right now the globalists blow something else up i think it's going to backfire on them exactly exactly and the reason
[01:10:45.766 --> 01:10:57.059]  That you and I are saying this to the people who are listening, and I say this on my show, is the people who are listening, for a long time, many of us have felt alone and very isolated.
[01:10:57.599 --> 01:11:02.485]  But the momentum has changed, and you're not alone any longer.
[01:11:02.705 --> 01:11:06.009]  You were talking about DU, which is depleted uranium.
[01:11:06.656 --> 01:11:13.109]  And just today, on the front page of the paper, Steve Hadley is now being the fall guy.
[01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:16.817]  Now they're admitting that they're using depleted uranium.
[01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:27.574]  And for those of you who are listening, this depleted uranium has been poisoning American and British troops for the last 12 years.
[01:11:28.194 --> 01:11:31.155]  It's poisoning American troops right now.
[01:11:31.715 --> 01:11:41.258]  And it has caused the death of untold thousands of defenseless Iraqi children in the last 10 years.
[01:11:41.499 --> 01:11:42.459]  And Serb children.
[01:11:43.118 --> 01:11:54.385]  It is unbelievable what we are doing, and it is unbelievable that the loving Democrats, the loving Liberals, are so quiet about this.
[01:11:55.206 --> 01:11:57.428]  It just blows my mind.
[01:11:57.668 --> 01:11:59.350]  Well, they all vote for Patriot Act.
[01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:02.252]  They helped write the Senate version.
[01:12:02.392 --> 01:12:06.415]  And the former head of the Pentagon was sent to whitewash this.
[01:12:06.475 --> 01:12:07.696]  He resigned in the early 90s.
[01:12:07.716 --> 01:12:08.877]  He said, I'm not going to be part of this.
[01:12:08.897 --> 01:12:09.878]  They have skin rashes.
[01:12:10.178 --> 01:12:11.259]  They have lung lesions.
[01:12:11.559 --> 01:12:12.780]  They have high levels of it.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.702]  If you ingest this, it's deadly.
[01:12:14.742 --> 01:12:16.063]  Here it is, the Charlotte Observer.
[01:12:17.484 --> 01:12:22.869]  And it says, Pentagon plans drafts of medics, I'm going to get into that article a little bit later.
[01:12:23.129 --> 01:12:43.387]  Here's the Buffalo News, excuse me, this is the article, warning of toxic aftermath from uranium munitions, the American use of depleted uranium munitions, thousands of tons, folks, in both Persian Gulf wars has unleashed a toxic disaster that will eclipse the Agent Orange tragedy of Vietnam War, a top, a former top Army official said Monday evening, former Major Douglas Rook,
[01:12:44.013 --> 01:12:52.762]  Who was director of the Army's depleted uranium project, spoke to 125 people at the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society in Champaign, Illinois.
[01:12:53.243 --> 01:12:56.806]  Science professor, was brought here by the Western New York Peace Center.
[01:12:57.427 --> 01:13:00.170]  I am a warrior, the 50 year old Vietnam veteran began.
[01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:01.932]  The sole purpose of war is to kill and destroy.
[01:13:02.192 --> 01:13:02.993]  There's no winners.
[01:13:03.593 --> 01:13:03.673]  Now,
[01:13:24.170 --> 01:13:33.432]  Called to active duty in 1990, Rick said he was assigned to develop procedures for cleaning up uranium contamination after they decided to use and put uranium munitions in the war to expel from Iraq and Kuwait.
[01:13:33.472 --> 01:13:48.355]  And he goes on about how he blood tested them then, he's blood tested people from this war, massive amounts in their bloodstream, in their lungs, causing radiation, cysts on the arms, fingernails, hair falling out, fast growing areas are hit.
[01:13:50.296 --> 01:14:01.786]  It's causing lung lesions, this is admitted, and he's a guy hired by them, and he has had the courage to come out and doesn't want the blood on his hands, and the average American still has no idea, George.
[01:14:01.827 --> 01:14:05.870]  Yeah, and the amazing thing is, is that this is not a new issue.
[01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:13.577]  Ten years ago, I and many, many other people, and perhaps you were too, were talking about the insanity
[01:14:14.128 --> 01:14:14.648]  I think?
[01:14:24.525 --> 01:14:41.249]  That the radiation from this uranium, which will remain active for many thousands of years, will contaminate the area around it for thousands of years, and the people who put these weapons together.
[01:14:41.569 --> 01:14:42.949]  And so this is not something new.
[01:14:42.969 --> 01:14:43.890]  George, I've got to stop you.
[01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:49.051]  The official numbers are between, depending on what batch of it, 500 million to a billion.
[01:14:49.331 --> 01:14:51.271]  Yeah, the half-life of this uranium is 234,000 years.
[01:14:54.648 --> 01:14:56.489]  And so that is the half-life.
[01:14:56.829 --> 01:14:59.511]  And so you multiply that out and it goes way out.
[01:15:00.852 --> 01:15:11.278]  So the point is, is that these rascals who are creating these weapons have absolutely no moral, Christian,
[01:15:11.866 --> 01:15:12.707]  Point of view.
[01:15:12.867 --> 01:15:16.769]  They are totally in their own world.
[01:15:17.150 --> 01:15:23.394]  They care not about the people who it's affecting, and they care not about the American Constitution.
[01:15:23.434 --> 01:15:24.094]  Stay there, George.
[01:15:24.114 --> 01:15:24.735]  We've got a break.
[01:15:24.755 --> 01:15:32.800]  When we get back, I promise this group of callers we've been holding for like an hour, that we'll get them on, we'll talk to them, then we'll wait to take more calls into the next hour.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:35.601]  So Dave and Jeff and Rambo and Ken and a few others stay there.
[01:15:35.621 --> 01:15:39.482]  We'll get to you this hour, then we'll cover news the rest of the hour and get back to calls in the next hour.
[01:15:39.522 --> 01:15:46.863]  There's so many subjects I want to cover, George, but for those that don't know, you're also a degreed economist and successful businessman and former city council member.
[01:15:47.783 --> 01:15:56.826]  I want to talk about Ron Paul's Neocon speech where he says the Bushes are Trotskyites who, quote, say, enter into evil and support a Machiavellian worldview.
[01:15:57.146 --> 01:15:58.426]  In a nutshell, what does that mean?
[01:15:59.153 --> 01:16:07.856]  Well, what that means is that the cabal of people who are in control of this administration have used the oxymoron of saying that they are neoconservatives.
[01:16:08.257 --> 01:16:20.081]  In fact, they are power-hungry plutocrats that will gather power from any foreman who have no respect, no respect for our Constitution or the rights of the American people.
[01:16:21.241 --> 01:16:22.222]  And here's Ron Paul.
[01:16:22.242 --> 01:16:27.384]  I mean, it's not just the National Post with the headline, The Ghost of Trotsky Walks the White House.
[01:16:28.303 --> 01:16:34.713]  Paul's, it's not just the AP reporting on it, the founders of it are the Fourth International and Trotsky.
[01:16:35.294 --> 01:16:35.615]  Correct.
[01:16:35.635 --> 01:16:37.758]  But you tell the average conservative that, it doesn't compute.
[01:16:37.818 --> 01:16:39.140]  Well, look at Brzezinski.
[01:16:39.281 --> 01:16:40.463]  Stay right there, Marge.
[01:16:40.483 --> 01:16:41.344]  We'll cover it when we get back.
[01:16:42.856 --> 01:16:44.457]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[01:18:42.106 --> 01:18:47.012]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a roadmap, and how easy it would be to get lost?
[01:18:47.312 --> 01:18:48.674]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[01:18:48.714 --> 01:18:51.037]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:54.320]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:54.721]  coins.
[01:18:54.961 --> 01:18:56.223]  The Redbook Guide to U.S.
[01:18:56.263 --> 01:19:00.768]  Coins and History provides you with the knowledge you'll need to make informed decisions when it comes to collecting

[01:19:01.829 --> 01:19:02.769]  gold and silver coins.

[01:19:40.973 --> 01:19:43.714]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[01:19:43.954 --> 01:19:50.277]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[01:19:50.577 --> 01:19:56.460]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them, but still have them safe and sound?
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.622]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax-exempt?
[01:20:01.357 --> 01:20:02.919]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[01:20:03.179 --> 01:20:04.020]  Well, there is a way.
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:10.386]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[01:20:10.766 --> 01:20:21.036]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years, and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[01:20:21.096 --> 01:20:21.897]  Constitution.
[01:20:22.177 --> 01:20:23.818]  You don't have to go offshore to do it, either.
[01:20:24.079 --> 01:20:26.361]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:34.525]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[01:20:34.805 --> 01:20:39.227]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[01:20:52.767 --> 01:20:53.828]  All right, we're back live.
[01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:58.094]  We're about to talk about the neocons, the supposed killing of Saddam's sons.
[01:20:58.134 --> 01:20:58.755]  Give me a break.
[01:20:58.775 --> 01:21:02.020]  And then your calls with George Humphrey.
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:05.405]  George, they even say here in the USA Today,
[01:21:06.747 --> 01:21:16.054]  The deaths represent a major victory for President Bush at a time when he is on the defensive over his justification for the Iraq War and hit and run attacks on U.S.
[01:21:16.074 --> 01:21:16.895]  troops.
[01:21:16.915 --> 01:21:22.739]  39 Americans have been killed by hostilities since May 1st, when Bush declared major combat over.
[01:21:22.759 --> 01:21:35.729]  Now, when I saw this headline last night on the news, heard him talking about it, I said, yeah, that's because the approval rating's down and it's really a good thing because that means they're not going to resort now, right now, to blowing things up to pose as our saviors.
[01:21:36.449 --> 01:21:37.731]  But they could still pull that.
[01:21:38.651 --> 01:21:43.115]  But it's very dangerous when their approval ratings drop because they need to get the New World Order agenda through.
[01:21:43.176 --> 01:21:45.558]  But they told us over and over again they'd kill them.
[01:21:45.678 --> 01:21:46.298]  Oh, we're sure.
[01:21:46.358 --> 01:21:47.159]  They were in the house.
[01:21:47.219 --> 01:21:48.941]  We're totally, you know, we're sure.
[01:21:49.081 --> 01:21:51.443]  And then a month later, oh, quietly, we didn't kill them.
[01:21:51.463 --> 01:21:52.684]  And then, oh, we killed them again.
[01:21:52.704 --> 01:21:58.710]  And we just have the same victories over and over again in this Orwellian mindset where Goldstein is killed every month.
[01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:59.230]  You know, in 1984, folks,
[01:22:00.151 --> 01:22:02.734]  There's this boogeyman that blows up buildings.
[01:22:03.194 --> 01:22:10.241]  He's called the Goldstein, but Winston finds it's really the government blowing things up as a pretext to keep war and control going.
[01:22:10.341 --> 01:22:11.142]  Oh, what do we see today?
[01:22:11.162 --> 01:22:14.505]  And then they say they killed Goldstein, but then he's always back.
[01:22:14.886 --> 01:22:17.268]  They're actually using this tactic, aren't they, George?
[01:22:17.628 --> 01:22:23.054]  Well, it is amazing that Carl Rowe, who used to live here in Austin, Texas,
[01:22:24.981 --> 01:22:26.502]  The guy is incredible.
[01:22:26.562 --> 01:22:29.143]  He is an absolute genius.
[01:22:29.183 --> 01:22:30.923]  He is a political marvel.
[01:22:31.324 --> 01:22:34.045]  But it's all about power.
[01:22:34.505 --> 01:22:37.246]  It's all about power and perception.
[01:22:37.806 --> 01:22:50.070]  And the fact is, is that all of these events, just like Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, are manipulated, preconceived events to manipulate the mind of the American people.
[01:22:50.658 --> 01:22:56.762]  And it is just so obvious to anyone who has taken the proverbial red pill.
[01:22:57.242 --> 01:23:04.206]  All one has to do is wake up and look at what's going on and see how manipulated these events are.
[01:23:04.486 --> 01:23:16.533]  For example, Steve Hadley, you know, Saddam's sons are killed the day before the hearings on the depleted uranium and the lies that were put forward by the Bush administration.
[01:23:17.213 --> 01:23:20.315]  And, you know, it's power politics.
[01:23:21.076 --> 01:23:26.019]  And if the American people, the American people have to make a choice.
[01:23:26.159 --> 01:23:39.126]  Either we believe in a constitutional republic in which we have a free press and a process of law, or they're going to just accept the fact that we have tyranny and a cabal and that we are in a police state.
[01:23:39.526 --> 01:23:44.729]  Now, in my belief system, and I believe that a vast majority of Americans,
[01:23:45.249 --> 01:23:48.493]  They don't teach that in school so folks don't know what freedom is.
[01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:08.974]  of patriotic Americans across the country who are doing their best day by day to share the truth.
[01:24:09.515 --> 01:24:11.175]  People are starting to wake up.
[01:24:11.235 --> 01:24:15.157]  Yeah, the globalists have to keep, George, the globalists have to keep reapplying their lies.
[01:24:15.498 --> 01:24:19.940]  We just have to show somebody how they're being lied to, show them the matrix, and they're off and running.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.041]  You know, once somebody wakes up
[01:24:22.623 --> 01:24:29.948]  And all of us who have had that epiphany, who have woken up, remember the day that the light went on.
[01:24:30.168 --> 01:24:32.449]  I remember when the light went on with me.
[01:24:32.569 --> 01:24:35.731]  I used to think I was a pretty hot stuff economist.
[01:24:35.791 --> 01:24:36.912]  I was a city councilman.
[01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:40.374]  I was in charge of a budget of $1.6 billion.
[01:24:41.275 --> 01:24:43.196]  I was a degreed economist.
[01:24:43.516 --> 01:24:45.738]  I thought I knew how the economy worked.
[01:24:45.778 --> 01:24:47.439]  You're a very successful businessman as well.
[01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:55.308]  One day, this guy started telling me about the Federal Reserve and Fractional Reserve Banking.
[01:24:55.808 --> 01:25:01.912]  And just as the emperor had no clothes on, I saw that emperor with these beautiful clothes.
[01:25:02.392 --> 01:25:05.894]  But I listened and listened, and eventually I got it.
[01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:08.776]  And when the light went on, it was amazing.
[01:25:09.296 --> 01:25:10.997]  Now, all of us have this choice.
[01:25:11.637 --> 01:25:19.342]  And I would say that a vast majority of your listeners, a vast majority, understand and can see through the matrix.
[01:25:19.884 --> 01:25:26.274]  And the reason they're listening to you is to get further information so that they can share it with their friends and family.
[01:25:26.335 --> 01:25:27.917]  It's for navigational purposes.
[01:25:28.298 --> 01:25:29.139]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:25:29.379 --> 01:25:31.583]  Because right now there's only one thing.
[01:25:32.284 --> 01:25:33.867]  We have to increase our numbers.
[01:25:34.855 --> 01:25:41.779]  Approximately one to one and a half percent of the population of this country now see the big picture, can connect the dots.
[01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:52.746]  But until we get up to about five percent of the population, which is about fourteen or fifteen million people, unless we get to that critical mass, we are totally, completely vulnerable.
[01:25:52.766 --> 01:25:54.467]  Well, George, I disagree with that.
[01:25:54.547 --> 01:26:04.293]  I think that we have ten percent know something's very badly wrong or constitutionalist, they just don't know how bad it is and they feel disempowered and are not active.
[01:26:05.231 --> 01:26:09.452]  And I would say that 3% are now awake, but a lot of them are afraid to speak up.
[01:26:09.612 --> 01:26:24.497]  Well, whatever the numbers are, and we don't have those objective numbers, is that we have to increase the numbers of people who see the big picture and, more importantly, have the courage and the moral fiber to stand up.
[01:26:24.537 --> 01:26:25.377]  They've got to spread it.
[01:26:25.477 --> 01:26:27.958]  We are white blood cells.
[01:26:28.458 --> 01:26:31.279]  I'm a T-lymphocyte trying to wake you up to fight the infection.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.160]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.261]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.161 --> 01:26:39.941]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.062 --> 01:26:46.082]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:26:46.382 --> 01:26:51.323]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:26:51.563 --> 01:26:55.404]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they are easy to take, drop, or form.
[01:26:55.824 --> 01:26:57.324]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[01:27:13.794 --> 01:27:18.215]  Alright, we now are about to accelerate into your calls for those who have been patiently holding.
[01:27:19.235 --> 01:27:24.357]  And then I'm going to throw out news stories and get George Humphrey's response and analysis to them.
[01:27:25.137 --> 01:27:30.719]  Before we go back to George, I am now carrying George's new book on tape.
[01:27:31.989 --> 01:27:36.370]  9-1-1, The Great Illusion, the Illuminati in-game, your choice, fear or love.
[01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:43.231]  It is over three hours long on two high-quality CDs that will play in your car or on your computer.
[01:27:45.032 --> 01:27:47.132]  Great audio book, professionally produced.
[01:27:47.412 --> 01:27:48.652]  Amazing information.
[01:27:49.452 --> 01:27:54.633]  Or you can get the booklets that are full color, have the color images and the color covers.
[01:27:55.134 --> 01:27:57.214]  Seventy pages long.
[01:27:58.147 --> 01:28:10.736]  And when you get these CDs from us, or we have it on audio cassette as well, I give you two of the booklets for free with that to give to friends or family or opinion makers in your area.
[01:28:11.376 --> 01:28:13.718]  And these audio CDs are a great tool.
[01:28:14.218 --> 01:28:24.906]  Some folks that won't watch a video, if you give them a nice little CD set that these come in with a nice little color packaging, they'll pop it in their car and listen to it when they're out driving around.
[01:28:25.868 --> 01:28:31.731]  And it's, in fact, I know a lot of people that have been woken up by tapes of this radio show or tapes of other radio shows.
[01:28:31.791 --> 01:28:36.594]  I've been mailed radio shows that were done 20 years ago.
[01:28:38.535 --> 01:28:41.757]  There's the famous Illuminati tapes that were done 30, 40 years ago.
[01:28:43.712 --> 01:28:45.874]  That have woken up tens of millions of people.
[01:28:45.954 --> 01:28:49.557]  So it's a great tool and you support the broadcast.
[01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:52.159]  It's $18.95 to get the two CDs and the two books.
[01:28:52.639 --> 01:28:55.482]  Or it's $15 to get five of the books.
[01:28:56.447 --> 01:29:01.869]  Just five of the books alone, or $18.95, you get the two CDs and two books.
[01:29:02.269 --> 01:29:04.529]  And that goes to support this broadcast and what we're doing.
[01:29:04.949 --> 01:29:13.351]  But more importantly, it's a great tool to wake people up, and it's concentrated information put in a way that only George Humphrey can do it.
[01:29:13.712 --> 01:29:18.573]  So please go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and order them.
[01:29:18.973 --> 01:29:21.854]  In the near future, I'm going to air some excerpts of the three-plus hour
[01:29:23.614 --> 01:29:28.316]  So, go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:29:28.336 --> 01:29:34.578]  It's on the main shopping cart in the section that says Other Insightful Authors and Producers.
[01:29:34.918 --> 01:29:35.758]  Just click on that.
[01:29:36.178 --> 01:29:38.379]  And, of course, get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:39.560]  Get The Mashes of Terror.
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.000]  Get Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.802]  Get my films and make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:29:46.222 --> 01:29:47.342]  Air them on AXS TV.
[01:29:47.742 --> 01:29:49.503]  Get them out to opinion makers in your area.
[01:29:49.863 --> 01:29:52.584]  A toll-free number to get my films, my book, George's books.
[01:29:53.144 --> 01:30:00.867]  Or, uh, books on tape, is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:30:02.407 --> 01:30:05.348]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:30:07.209 --> 01:30:15.892]  And you may know all about the New World Order, but your neighbor, that police officer, that city council member, just like George used to be who got woken up, they're not aware.
[01:30:16.312 --> 01:30:18.293]  Give them the gift of enlightenment.
[01:30:18.573 --> 01:30:24.178]  Of understanding the world, of knowing what's really behind the scenes, of exposing the destruction of America.
[01:30:24.198 --> 01:30:27.441]  888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:45.820]  George, would you like to speak to the CDs or the cassettes or the booklet itself?
[01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:51.331]  Well, first of all, Alex, I'm very honored that you will carry them on your website.
[01:30:52.901 --> 01:31:05.925]  You know, it's hard to be objective about your own work, but when I write this stuff, I write it so, number one, is that it's understandable, is that we have lots of pictures, we keep it short so that people can read it.
[01:31:05.945 --> 01:31:15.908]  A lot of times people won't read a 300-page book, but everybody can look to read a 70-page book, booklet, or listen to a CD or a cassette.
[01:31:16.748 --> 01:31:22.070]  The production of it, my friend, our good friend Rusty Fields, who has got a great voice,
[01:31:22.585 --> 01:31:22.785]  I think so.
[01:31:33.004 --> 01:31:38.908]  It's my experience, I've had this out for just a few months, but the response on this has been excellent.
[01:31:38.968 --> 01:31:49.316]  I've had not one, but thousands of letters saying that they have given the booklet, or the CD, or the cassette to friends.
[01:31:49.556 --> 01:31:53.899]  George, tell folks, you also gave a copy to every member of the House of Representatives here in Texas.
[01:31:54.239 --> 01:31:56.721]  We did the same thing with my DVDs and VHS.
[01:31:58.182 --> 01:32:03.225]  Tell folks, if you want, how many total booklets and tapes of all three of your books you've gotten out?
[01:32:03.785 --> 01:32:09.108]  Well, all together, we've gotten out close to 110,000 booklets.
[01:32:09.389 --> 01:32:17.373]  The first book, of course, was called Common Sense, and that was in recognition of the great, a patriot, Thomas Paine.
[01:32:17.993 --> 01:32:24.357]  The second book was Uncommon Sense, and the third book is 9-1-1, The Great Illusion.
[01:32:25.194 --> 01:32:37.784]  And it goes from a... Common Sense is a wonderful book for those who are just learning about the history of the New World Order and what's going on.
[01:32:38.304 --> 01:32:44.769]  Uncommon Sense takes it a step further and provides a lot of cutting-edge information.
[01:32:44.789 --> 01:32:54.476]  9-1-1, The Great Illusion, is, if it wasn't for you, Alex, and David Icke, and people like Chris Bolin, and others, I couldn't have written this.
[01:32:55.003 --> 01:33:04.568]  But it is a concise 60 points of factual information that absolutely proves beyond a doubt.
[01:33:05.029 --> 01:33:06.930]  And 7 points of solutions?
[01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:07.650]  Yes.
[01:33:07.890 --> 01:33:10.411]  It proves without a doubt the Globalist carried 9-1-1 out.
[01:33:10.632 --> 01:33:12.052]  There's no question.
[01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:14.754]  It is absolutely empirical.
[01:33:15.427 --> 01:33:16.707]  Objective information.
[01:33:16.727 --> 01:33:18.388]  The problem is there's so many facts.
[01:33:18.448 --> 01:33:20.609]  I've had to make two films and write a book.
[01:33:20.829 --> 01:33:21.009]  Right.
[01:33:21.089 --> 01:33:22.629]  And I could make five other films.
[01:33:22.649 --> 01:33:23.150]  We could just keep going.
[01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:24.290]  There's so much annoyance.
[01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:30.492]  But the bottom line is there were bombs in the World Trade Center before the planes hit.
[01:33:30.892 --> 01:33:32.993]  No ifs, ands, or buts.
[01:33:33.033 --> 01:33:39.295]  Seismographs, eyewitnesses, prior knowledge, funding the terrorists, on and on and on and on.
[01:33:39.555 --> 01:33:39.695]  Yep.
[01:33:40.851 --> 01:33:43.173]  And so, this is the main point.
[01:33:43.253 --> 01:33:51.999]  If we can get these simple points across to good Americans who love this country, then we can build up our base.
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:57.323]  Then we can restore what is good and moral about this country.
[01:33:57.844 --> 01:34:06.550]  But we, which means all the people listening, every single one of us, have to carry this information to everyone we talk to.
[01:34:06.931 --> 01:34:08.512]  And Alex, you are like me.
[01:34:09.108 --> 01:34:10.349]  I don't go anywhere.
[01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:15.995]  I go into a grocery store and I start talking to the clerk about the New World Order.
[01:34:17.157 --> 01:34:19.439]  Everywhere I go, I talk about this.
[01:34:19.499 --> 01:34:21.942]  And the reason is, we don't have a choice.
[01:34:22.042 --> 01:34:23.183]  I want to save their life.
[01:34:23.303 --> 01:34:25.766]  I see somebody inserted in the Matrix.
[01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:26.667]  I want to get them out.
[01:34:26.987 --> 01:34:27.948]  Yep.
[01:34:28.328 --> 01:34:30.511]  And on a more personal basis,
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.681]  I want to save my own life and my family's life.
[01:34:35.501 --> 01:34:42.502]  On a larger level is that I love this thing, this dream called the American Republic.
[01:34:42.922 --> 01:34:45.923]  My culture, my family, my friends.
[01:34:46.823 --> 01:34:51.484]  And on a bigger picture, it's for all the people of this world.
[01:34:52.664 --> 01:34:56.645]  It's not just the people in Austin or in Texas or the United States.
[01:34:57.705 --> 01:34:58.805]  Every human being
[01:34:59.548 --> 01:35:05.012]  In this world, whether they're in India, or in Argentina, or in Austin, or in New York.
[01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:06.794]  They're all under New World Order of Attack.
[01:35:06.814 --> 01:35:08.195]  They're all under attack.
[01:35:09.876 --> 01:35:10.937]  George, let's take some calls.
[01:35:10.977 --> 01:35:14.099]  I want to get back into the neocons, and a bunch of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.321]  Dave, in Arkansas, thanks for holding.
[01:35:17.341 --> 01:35:19.903]  You're on the air with our guest, George Humphrey, and I'm Alex Jones.
[01:35:19.923 --> 01:35:20.244]  Go ahead.
[01:35:20.864 --> 01:35:23.506]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to make a couple points real quick.
[01:35:24.227 --> 01:35:26.528]  I've been waiting for a long time to call your show.
[01:35:26.548 --> 01:35:27.249]  I really enjoy it.
[01:35:27.902 --> 01:35:31.569]  I don't think there's any shame in dodging away from a bad situation.
[01:35:39.258 --> 01:35:41.139]  It's not like it was necessary to go over there.
[01:35:41.179 --> 01:35:42.480]  They didn't have much of a plan.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.061]  Well, this is the deal.
[01:35:44.141 --> 01:35:45.182]  This isn't our government.
[01:35:45.222 --> 01:35:46.423]  This isn't our military.
[01:35:46.503 --> 01:35:51.406]  Now there's $100 billion to $200 billion a year for mercenaries who quote, wear black uniforms.
[01:35:51.766 --> 01:35:53.187]  I read the article yesterday.
[01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:56.389]  They abuse and misuse our troops.
[01:35:56.809 --> 01:35:58.971]  Let them get hit with weapons sold to them by the government.
[01:35:59.231 --> 01:36:00.291]  Then don't give them treatment.
[01:36:00.431 --> 01:36:01.192]  That's a fact.
[01:36:01.752 --> 01:36:04.194]  And then they put them under UN or globalist control.
[01:36:05.283 --> 01:36:10.444]  And, you know, yeah, it was bad for Bill Clinton to go to Russia and protest the war and put down America.
[01:36:10.824 --> 01:36:15.825]  It's not bad to be against a phony war, and that's what Ron Paul, who's a Vietnam veteran, had to say.
[01:36:16.085 --> 01:36:16.525]  Well, right.
[01:36:16.545 --> 01:36:21.926]  I mean, you shouldn't go over there and get yourself shot up just because, you know, your country says.
[01:36:21.986 --> 01:36:23.626]  But, you know, I'm a liberal for thinking that.
[01:36:23.806 --> 01:36:25.667]  But it's not your country that's even saying it.
[01:36:25.707 --> 01:36:30.548]  We have this parasite sitting up on top of the brain of America.
[01:36:31.168 --> 01:36:32.388]  George, can you speak to this?
[01:36:33.078 --> 01:36:42.563]  Well, I think the gentleman is absolutely correct, and I think all your listeners realize, is that we, the people who are talking about this, we support our troops.
[01:36:43.123 --> 01:36:44.744]  We support our military.
[01:36:44.784 --> 01:36:47.605]  George Washington was against foreign entanglements.
[01:36:47.725 --> 01:36:58.671]  But what we support them is to do their proper job of protecting the Constitution, protecting our rights, and doing the right and moral thing.
[01:36:59.491 --> 01:37:00.974]  We have a question.
[01:37:01.094 --> 01:37:09.849]  Either we can be a republic, or we can be the most aggressive country in the whole world.
[01:37:10.638 --> 01:37:23.150]  And the fact is, I don't think most Americans want us to go to these countries around the world, killing tens of thousands of innocents, so that the multinational corporations can take their mineral.
[01:37:23.530 --> 01:37:25.792]  And by the way, it's not our words when we say that.
[01:37:26.233 --> 01:37:26.473]  Okay?
[01:37:26.513 --> 01:37:27.934]  And the Democrats are involved in it too.
[01:37:27.995 --> 01:37:29.055]  They all voted for the war.
[01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:30.537]  It's a fake left-right fight.
[01:37:31.252 --> 01:37:34.895]  Ron Paul, most conservative member of Congress, is against it, and he explains it.
[01:37:35.255 --> 01:37:42.740]  We have Dick Cheney's Energy Task Force documents now, part of them, where they were divvying up the oil, talking about going in before 9-1-1.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:51.746]  So, we have PNAC, Project for an American Century, with Dick Cheney and others saying, we need a terrorist attack to get the people behind a war for empire.
[01:37:52.838 --> 01:37:56.719]  So, it's not our words, it's not our opinion, it's the facts.
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:57.360]  Go ahead, George.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:05.903]  Well, Alex, you say it so beautifully, and it just has to be said by everyone, and you're giving out this objective information.
[01:38:06.463 --> 01:38:10.364]  Cheney and his Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz and Pearl.
[01:38:11.225 --> 01:38:16.406]  And this Pearl is functionally and emotionally insane.
[01:38:17.047 --> 01:38:17.867]  I mean, he truly is.
[01:38:18.695 --> 01:38:20.076]  And this man... Let me stop you.
[01:38:20.096 --> 01:38:29.824]  The Washington Times reported three months ago that he was at a White House press dinner and he walked up to a bunch of beautiful women, some models that were there.
[01:38:29.844 --> 01:38:34.828]  This was in the news, and began giggling and saying, I run things.
[01:38:34.928 --> 01:38:37.010]  We're going to be in North Korea soon.
[01:38:37.190 --> 01:38:38.051]  I have power.
[01:38:38.411 --> 01:38:43.656]  And they call him the Prince of Darkness because he runs around giggling about killing people all the time.
[01:38:44.516 --> 01:38:46.438]  He is absolutely
[01:38:47.338 --> 01:38:48.278]  He's a Kim Jong-Un!
[01:39:10.549 --> 01:39:17.753]  Who none of you would invite to dinner because they are so morally degenerate.
[01:39:18.313 --> 01:39:20.634]  These people are sick puppies.
[01:39:21.275 --> 01:39:34.502]  And also if I could make another point just real quick, I've been speaking out in my area against this whole New World Order thing and some things that I know because I was in the military and I've been constantly harassed because of it.
[01:39:34.522 --> 01:39:38.884]  There's been black helicopters flying around, there's people have come up to me
[01:39:39.474 --> 01:39:41.116]  I'll just be going to the supermarket or something.
[01:39:41.136 --> 01:39:44.299]  They'll say, hey, you need to stop talking about this.
[01:39:44.359 --> 01:39:45.199]  We know where you're at.
[01:39:45.219 --> 01:39:46.401]  We know where your family's at.
[01:39:46.821 --> 01:39:50.224]  And I came home the other day and they were putting anthrax in my house.
[01:39:50.264 --> 01:39:50.604]  The U.S.
[01:39:50.645 --> 01:39:51.265]  military was.
[01:39:51.305 --> 01:39:57.351]  And they tried to say that they were just there checking on some things because people had reported that I had guns or something like that.
[01:39:57.853 --> 01:40:02.597]  That I wasn't supposed to have, saying I had munitions that I wasn't supposed to have, and they were putting things in my house.
[01:40:02.737 --> 01:40:03.697]  Well, let me break that down.
[01:40:03.737 --> 01:40:04.838]  This is happening to you.
[01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:06.780]  This is the vast minority.
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:09.502]  They do this so it's talked about, so it scares people.
[01:40:09.902 --> 01:40:10.603]  Let me break it down.
[01:40:10.663 --> 01:40:11.784]  And they have been caught doing this.
[01:40:12.204 --> 01:40:15.626]  Massive funding for domestic anti-terror forces has been increased.
[01:40:17.068 --> 01:40:22.712]  And then people who talk about the New World Order or talk about corruption or whatever, they are then
[01:40:23.641 --> 01:40:31.666]  Targeted, and they're looking for somebody in the media to go, oh look, here's the danger as a set piece or end cap.
[01:40:32.146 --> 01:40:37.910]  And that's the vast minority of people, the vast majority I talk to are converting folks, people that are waking up.
[01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:46.956]  But in key conservative areas where they're worried that you can wake up conservatives, and especially people that have special forces past, they are being harassed.
[01:40:47.236 --> 01:40:48.537]  Are you former special forces?
[01:40:49.336 --> 01:40:50.498]  Yes, yes.
[01:40:50.579 --> 01:40:52.341]  I really can't talk too much about it.
[01:40:52.762 --> 01:40:54.305]  Did you ever carry out assassinations?
[01:40:54.345 --> 01:40:56.148]  Well, like I said, because I've been harassed and stuff.
[01:41:02.617 --> 01:41:05.778]  I'll just say there's a lot of dirty work going on and I was talking about it.
[01:41:06.118 --> 01:41:11.681]  I'm asking you sir, were you special forces in assassination teams?
[01:41:12.201 --> 01:41:13.021]  Yes, yes I was.
[01:41:13.421 --> 01:41:16.042]  Well that's who they go, they're very afraid of people like you.
[01:41:17.243 --> 01:41:24.466]  Because let me tell you something, most former special forces people later find out, later join the fight against the new world order.
[01:41:24.486 --> 01:41:28.187]  There are hundreds of thousands of you and thousands of you do get harassed.
[01:41:28.247 --> 01:41:31.249]  See I know the MO, that's why I was able to point that out.
[01:41:31.309 --> 01:41:32.069]  George comments.
[01:41:32.469 --> 01:41:35.916]  Well, another thing is that many of our special forces
[01:41:36.528 --> 01:41:42.671]  They have been, their minds have been compartmentalized and they have been mind-controlled.
[01:41:42.791 --> 01:41:52.355]  And many of these people are starting to wake up and integrate their thinking and remembering what has been put into their thought process.
[01:41:52.455 --> 01:42:02.939]  And they rebel against this because most of the Special Forces people are just good Americans who signed up because they believed in America and want to protect America.
[01:42:03.039 --> 01:42:04.120]  And when they find out
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:13.223]  The Special Forces is designed to be behind enemy lines and force multiply the indigenous population in the Info War.
[01:42:23.112 --> 01:42:35.975]  But the main point to 99.9% of the people listening is, there's not a thing that I would say on this radio show or on my television show that I wouldn't say to our Chief of Police or our elected officials.
[01:42:36.495 --> 01:42:38.015]  We believe in the Republic.
[01:42:38.375 --> 01:42:39.755]  We believe in the Constitution.
[01:42:40.095 --> 01:42:40.936]  The process of law.
[01:42:40.956 --> 01:42:44.096]  And as long as we are standing in
[01:42:47.987 --> 01:42:54.950]  The right, as long as we look them in the eyes, as long as we are unafraid, they want us to be afraid.
[01:42:54.970 --> 01:43:00.193]  Yeah, that gives them power, because the guys carrying out the harassment, the assassinations, they're afraid.
[01:43:00.853 --> 01:43:03.614]  And more and more they're losing that control, that's why they're panicking.
[01:43:03.634 --> 01:43:04.114]  Thanks, Dave.
[01:43:04.875 --> 01:43:09.317]  Let's talk to Jeff, and Jeff's calling from New Orleans, Louisiana.
[01:43:09.357 --> 01:43:10.057]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:43:10.157 --> 01:43:13.439]  That city's been federalized, by the way, according to the Times-Picayune.
[01:43:13.459 --> 01:43:13.779]  Go ahead.
[01:43:14.412 --> 01:43:19.356]  Yes, last week, July 16, two significant events occurred that are contrasts.
[01:43:20.036 --> 01:43:23.079]  One, a great American died of brain cancer.
[01:43:23.439 --> 01:43:31.885]  This person was born in Cuba, but left after Fidel Castro came into power because she would not be his mistress, came to the United States.
[01:43:31.926 --> 01:43:39.511]  She was an advocate of capitalism, free market economics, liberty and fidelity in marriage, and of course her name was Celia Cruz.
[01:43:40.332 --> 01:43:44.135]  But the reason I bring this up is to show you that at the same time that she died,
[01:43:44.933 --> 01:43:50.676]  Cuban refugees trying to reach America in a boat from Cuba, a la the Marielle type invasion.
[01:43:51.376 --> 01:43:55.498]  Our immigration service picked them up and then sent them back to Cuba yesterday.
[01:43:55.518 --> 01:43:56.958]  They're going to be tortured.
[01:43:57.519 --> 01:44:00.380]  Yeah, they're going to be tortured for 10 years in Cuban jails.
[01:44:00.945 --> 01:44:04.686]  And the point is that this so-called open borders policy is a joke.
[01:44:04.907 --> 01:44:10.048]  Yeah, if you're an illegal from Russia or Chinese mob, you're in the country.
[01:44:10.329 --> 01:44:13.550]  But if you're a Cuban who's a real political refugee, you're not getting in.
[01:44:13.710 --> 01:44:14.550]  George, any comments?
[01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:19.232]  Well, the fact is, between 1917 to 1965, there was an average of 133,000 legal immigrants per year coming into this country.
[01:44:25.334 --> 01:44:36.313]  Today, because of the immigration laws of 1965, we are going to have over 965,000 legal immigrants, mostly from third world nations.
[01:44:36.907 --> 01:44:42.070]  And between 800,000 to 1,200,000 illegal immigrants.
[01:44:42.190 --> 01:44:43.171]  Those are low estimates.
[01:44:43.311 --> 01:44:46.132]  These are... I'm being as conservative as possible.
[01:44:46.493 --> 01:44:56.998]  And when one does the objective demographics on what this means to our country... It means death of America and these people will pull a lever for total gun control in the voting booth.
[01:44:57.419 --> 01:44:59.380]  We'll be back with more calls with our guest George Humphrey.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:01.381]  He'll be with us in the second hour, third hour as well.
[01:45:03.766 --> 01:45:06.028]  Are you willing to speculate in today's market?
[01:45:06.348 --> 01:45:10.031]  Options investing involves substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.
[01:45:10.371 --> 01:45:12.553]  I'm Patrick T. Parker for Barclay Financial.
[01:45:12.713 --> 01:45:16.656]  Right now, we're recommending the purchase of euro currency call options.
[01:45:16.996 --> 01:45:19.138]  The budget and trade deficits are going through the roof.
[01:45:19.238 --> 01:45:21.199]  The dollar is dropping worldwide.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:23.101]  Could the euro be poised to move higher?
[01:45:23.361 --> 01:45:24.102]  We think so.
[01:45:24.342 --> 01:45:28.565]  For a free special market report on the euro currency, call Barclay Financial right now.
[01:45:28.725 --> 01:45:28.965]  Call 800-348-4100.
[01:45:28.985 --> 01:45:29.166]  That's 800-348-4100.
[01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:34.630]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[01:45:34.650 --> 01:45:41.834]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[01:45:42.114 --> 01:45:45.036]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.

[01:46:03.917 --> 01:46:07.399]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[01:46:07.659 --> 01:46:11.162]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:46:11.262 --> 01:46:15.204]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:46:15.425 --> 01:46:21.589]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:21.989 --> 01:46:29.914]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:46:30.314 --> 01:46:35.657]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[01:46:35.817 --> 01:46:39.578]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:46:39.959 --> 01:46:41.799]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[01:46:41.859 --> 01:46:44.041]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:07.012]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:07.192 --> 01:47:11.615]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:11.775 --> 01:47:16.137]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:47:16.177 --> 01:47:17.518]  The New World Order.
[01:47:18.479 --> 01:47:20.100]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:33.055 --> 01:47:43.482]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:47:43.662 --> 01:47:49.046]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:48:08.650 --> 01:48:10.570]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:48:11.031 --> 01:48:13.991]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:16.512 --> 01:48:17.532]  Alright, folks.
[01:48:17.792 --> 01:48:19.432]  Rambo in Washington State.
[01:48:19.472 --> 01:48:20.352]  Go ahead, Rambo.
[01:48:21.053 --> 01:48:21.533]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:21.633 --> 01:48:22.313]  It's Randall.
[01:48:22.653 --> 01:48:24.533]  I don't know why they were telling me Rambo.
[01:48:24.553 --> 01:48:26.814]  They go, I wonder why he's saying his name's Rambo.
[01:48:26.834 --> 01:48:28.734]  I was like, okay, folks.
[01:48:29.294 --> 01:48:32.435]  I wanted to address the cable and TV issue.
[01:48:33.422 --> 01:48:35.363]  All right, let me stop you for those that just joined us.
[01:48:36.004 --> 01:48:51.974]  I read a television news report, that's the name of the site, and I've got MSNBC as well, that the digital cable boxes, the satellite stuff, that it has a record of what you watch and what you do, and I pointed out that the Scientific Atlantic cable boxes here in Austin, this is a fact, have a microphone in them, go ahead.
[01:48:52.955 --> 01:49:01.120]  Okay, I used to be the cable company here where I live, used to let you purchase your own cable box and remote so you didn't have to rent from them.
[01:49:01.847 --> 01:49:03.368]  And hook it up to your TV.
[01:49:03.909 --> 01:49:07.572]  Now, you had to pay for the premium services, and I didn't have a problem with that.
[01:49:08.092 --> 01:49:20.643]  I called my cable company a couple weeks ago to ask them if I could purchase my own box and pay for the premium services, and they flatly said, no, you can't do that.
[01:49:20.663 --> 01:49:27.129]  You have to rent the box from us and rent the remote.
[01:49:27.927 --> 01:49:34.811]  Now, I just bought a TV a couple months ago and come to learn that it's going to be obsolete in about a year or two.
[01:49:34.831 --> 01:49:36.551]  They're going to force you onto the high definition.
[01:49:36.572 --> 01:49:38.352]  Let me get a comment from George on this, George.
[01:49:39.113 --> 01:49:45.156]  Well, the facts speak for themselves in every facet of our lives.
[01:49:46.008 --> 01:49:51.774]  By the way, DARPA paid to put the cameras and microphones in five years ago.
[01:49:51.794 --> 01:49:58.280]  That's the statesman, and then they claim it's a new program this year and that it didn't get its funding?
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:49:59.722]  I mean, that's a total lie!
[01:50:10.638 --> 01:50:11.679]  George, go ahead.
[01:50:11.919 --> 01:50:13.640]  Randall, you're right on target here.
[01:50:14.161 --> 01:50:16.883]  And there is so much information.
[01:50:16.923 --> 01:50:23.627]  The fact that you've worked with the cable company is that your testimony is so important.
[01:50:23.667 --> 01:50:24.668]  Yeah, go ahead and continue.
[01:50:24.688 --> 01:50:26.289]  Have you heard about the microphones in them?
[01:50:26.309 --> 01:50:26.970]  That's a fact.
[01:50:28.651 --> 01:50:30.873]  I haven't heard about the microphones.
[01:50:30.893 --> 01:50:36.477]  A couple of months ago, I caught your article about them putting, or your show about them
[01:50:37.577 --> 01:50:40.498]  With the psychological meters and monitoring what you watch.
[01:50:40.618 --> 01:50:43.838]  Now, I have an older box, but it would have worked.
[01:50:44.799 --> 01:50:49.960]  And one thing else I would like to address is the VHS, DVD issue.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:59.122]  Years ago, VCRs, like home computers, were never intended, were not supposed to be for civilian use.
[01:51:00.262 --> 01:51:06.924]  I learned this from somebody, and the reason why is with a VCR, you can
[01:51:07.535 --> 01:51:08.556]  Watch what you want.
[01:51:09.616 --> 01:51:10.757]  You can't be monitored.
[01:51:11.397 --> 01:51:21.162]  And I was wondering if you had any comments about why... They've announced they want new TVs and new VCRs to dial in either wirelessly or over the internet.
[01:51:21.602 --> 01:51:23.923]  And now they have these entertainment centers that are all merged.
[01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:26.645]  And then we'll report back on what you're doing.
[01:51:26.725 --> 01:51:32.027]  And then if you are recording something you're not supposed to be, stuff that's copyrighted, it'll be criminal charges.
[01:51:32.088 --> 01:51:33.108]  Has George heard about that?
[01:51:33.448 --> 01:51:34.849]  Yeah, I've heard about that.
[01:51:35.290 --> 01:51:37.234]  They're eliminating VCRs completely.
[01:51:37.334 --> 01:51:37.995]  I can't go in.
[01:51:38.756 --> 01:51:40.039]  I went into Blockbuster.
[01:51:40.439 --> 01:51:46.811]  I went into Suncoast Motion Picture to try to get VHS documentaries and movies that I want to watch.
[01:51:47.344 --> 01:51:48.384]  And they are wiping the VHS.
[01:51:48.424 --> 01:51:56.288]  Well, that's one reason we're going to offer the films on DVD and VHS, but I want to stay in VHS as much as possible because it's easier to make copies.
[01:51:56.768 --> 01:51:57.668]  Everybody's got it.
[01:51:57.708 --> 01:51:59.269]  It's easier for them to make copies.
[01:51:59.569 --> 01:52:00.369]  Well, this is the thing.
[01:52:00.389 --> 01:52:06.612]  I intend to homeschool, and a lot of the historical stuff that is accurate has been put out on VHS.
[01:52:06.732 --> 01:52:08.512]  I mean, I've got laser disc players.
[01:52:08.652 --> 01:52:09.833]  I'm collecting machines.
[01:52:10.963 --> 01:52:14.307]  I'm getting new machines because I'm going to need the audio-visual.
[01:52:14.347 --> 01:52:17.069]  Well, a lot of stuff is going into the memory hole to be destroyed.
[01:52:17.089 --> 01:52:17.650]  Thanks for the call.
[01:52:18.771 --> 01:52:20.032]  George, stay with us in the next hour.
[01:52:20.072 --> 01:52:22.875]  We'll have more time for you to elaborate and get some information out.
[01:52:23.275 --> 01:52:24.617]  I promise I'll finish with these callers.
[01:52:24.857 --> 01:52:25.377]  Great.
[01:52:25.437 --> 01:52:27.059]  And Steve, finish up in the next hour.
[01:52:27.079 --> 01:52:29.021]  Then I'm going to hold off for the last 20 minutes.
[01:52:29.061 --> 01:52:30.022]  After that, take calls.
[01:52:30.362 --> 01:52:35.087]  We'll have a good 35-40 minutes to just cover news and go over your analysis of the New World Order.
[01:52:35.527 --> 01:52:46.709]  And how we're right on the edge of more government-sponsored terror, and how we can hopefully expose that and save lives and stop the enemy combatants that run the government, the terrorists, the overthrowers, the revolutionaries.
[01:52:47.329 --> 01:52:49.909]  How do we defeat the revolutionaries as counter-revolutionaries?
[01:52:49.929 --> 01:52:51.010]  We'll be back in the third hour.
[01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:55.630]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:55.950 --> 01:53:01.691]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:53:01.932 --> 01:53:04.692]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from...
[01:53:08.627 --> 01:53:11.829]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.335 --> 01:53:19.995]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.656 --> 01:53:21.717]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.417 --> 01:53:23.598]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:23.618 --> 01:53:25.039]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:26.700]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.321 --> 01:53:31.264]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.504 --> 01:53:35.607]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:36.897 --> 01:53:58.844]  A former city council member, economist, a prolific researcher and writer, George Humphrey, my good friend from right here in Austin, Texas, joins us as we blast out on the AM and FM dial across the country, simulcast to the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and on Global Shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20 and at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[01:54:05.851 --> 01:54:06.893]  And George is our guest.
[01:54:07.433 --> 01:54:09.055]  I got two callers that have been left over.
[01:54:09.456 --> 01:54:12.780]  Other callers will have to hold the last 20-30 minutes because then I'll go back to calls.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:15.544]  But right now, George, let's finish up with Ken and Steve.
[01:54:16.265 --> 01:54:18.387]  Ken in Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:54:18.427 --> 01:54:18.788]  Go ahead.
[01:54:19.372 --> 01:54:29.798]  Yes, I think all of your audience should know about an absolute blockbuster victory we had last night in the House of Representatives where they voted 309 to 118.
[01:54:29.878 --> 01:54:30.998]  To defund Homeland Security?
[01:54:31.059 --> 01:54:33.700]  No, to pass an appropriations bill amendment
[01:54:41.457 --> 01:54:45.899]  Stripping the USA Patriot Act of one of its most tyrannical provisions.
[01:54:46.179 --> 01:54:47.379]  Section 215.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:55.943]  This is the one that allows government agents to secretly search homes of suspects and only inform them later that a warrant has been issued to do so.
[01:54:55.963 --> 01:54:56.703]  Now let me stop you.
[01:54:56.743 --> 01:54:57.403]  This is big.
[01:54:57.483 --> 01:55:01.205]  This is big, Ken, and I have the article and it's one of the things I was going to throw at George, but...
[01:55:01.997 --> 01:55:06.401]  If mine says section 215, it's section 213 that's breaking in the houses.
[01:55:06.681 --> 01:55:08.062]  Are you saying they reversed section 213?
[01:55:08.342 --> 01:55:23.194]  I don't have the number, but the thing about that is that just the day before Ashcroft had defended the whole act as being, as saying the criticisms of it were based on exaggerations and falsehoods.
[01:55:23.595 --> 01:55:29.880]  So this is a proof that Ashcroft and the Bush administration have been using
[01:55:31.207 --> 01:55:45.895]  The fact that he's defending this unconstitutional act, which the House has now trashed this important section, is proof that he's been using the World Trade Center disaster to bring in the National Police State.
[01:55:46.075 --> 01:55:53.798]  Sir, that shows how across the board, and I do have the article, it is true, that shows how across the board the heat on Congress is massive.
[01:55:54.299 --> 01:55:55.379]  George Humphrey comments.
[01:55:55.499 --> 01:55:56.460]  Now, can I?
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.461]  Yeah, I want to say something more.
[01:55:58.481 --> 01:55:59.081]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:55:59.541 --> 01:56:12.224]  Well, in this state, we had eight Republicans, and they all voted wrong on the first time because, of course, they had no time, but they were all pressured, and they all voted wrong, even our best congressman.
[01:56:12.584 --> 01:56:20.826]  This time, four of them corrected their earlier vote, and they voted correctly for this amendment, along with Ron Paul.
[01:56:21.206 --> 01:56:26.787]  We also had three Democrats, and the thing is that with this victory,
[01:56:28.446 --> 01:56:39.550]  There's a good possibility that there could be more Patriot measures to come later, because this should be trumpeted to the housetops.
[01:56:39.590 --> 01:56:41.191]  This is psychological warfare.
[01:56:41.211 --> 01:56:42.191]  Okay, hold on, hold on.
[01:56:42.251 --> 01:56:43.131]  George, comments?
[01:56:43.311 --> 01:56:53.495]  Okay, well the fact is that both Homeland Security and the Patriot Act are the nails in the coffin to the American Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:56:54.239 --> 01:57:12.508]  And fortunately, around this country, people are waking up to that fact, and are blowing the horns, and speaking loudly, and our elected representatives slowly are listening to these people, and they realize that there is a mounting storm of indignation.
[01:57:12.928 --> 01:57:14.409]  And so this is good news.
[01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:21.315]  The fact is, though, is that the cabal that is in right now... They don't care about laws!
[01:57:21.595 --> 01:57:38.448]  ...are totally, totally corrupt, is that Ashcroft, who says that he is a great Christian, his very first act, on the first day he was in, was to go in and close down the Indianapolis Baptist Temple, which was a Christian, non-corporated church.
[01:57:39.108 --> 01:57:39.528]  I think so.
[01:58:09.388 --> 01:58:10.369]  Out right now.
[01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:11.829]  Okay, we'll be back.
[01:58:12.049 --> 01:58:12.870]  Ken, great point.
[01:58:12.890 --> 01:58:13.430]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:14.851 --> 01:58:16.511]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:58:16.611 --> 01:58:18.772]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:58:18.953 --> 01:58:19.953]  It feels great.
[01:58:20.133 --> 01:58:21.134]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:58:21.234 --> 01:58:26.576]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:58:26.836 --> 01:58:28.577]  I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:58:28.757 --> 01:58:31.898]  I've lost 16 pounds, and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:58:31.998 --> 01:58:32.659]  Incredible.
[01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:34.159]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:58:34.199 --> 01:58:37.701]  I'm a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:58:38.021 --> 01:58:41.462]  Sharon lost 28 pounds with collagen aid from Vim and Vigor.
[01:58:41.482 --> 01:58:48.264]  I have arthritis and I have a thyroid problem and blood pressure and Vim and Vigor has really been a blessing to me.
[01:58:48.504 --> 01:58:54.126]  I've lost 28 pounds and counting and I thank them very much from the bottom of my heart.
[01:58:54.506 --> 01:58:59.147]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.

[01:59:00.367 --> 01:59:00.708]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:59:00.728 --> 01:59:01.248]  $25 off a 3-month supply.
[01:59:01.268 --> 01:59:02.248]  So call Vim and Vigor today, 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:59:02.268 --> 01:59:02.708]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:59:02.728 --> 01:59:05.889]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:59:19.045 --> 01:59:20.327]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:59:20.527 --> 01:59:26.295]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:59:26.555 --> 01:59:31.842]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:59:32.103 --> 01:59:33.725]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[01:59:33.865 --> 01:59:35.386]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:59:53.796 --> 01:59:55.878]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[01:59:55.958 --> 01:59:59.320]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:01.601]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:01.842 --> 02:00:07.505]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[02:00:07.605 --> 02:00:09.607]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[02:00:09.847 --> 02:00:11.348]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:00:11.528 --> 02:00:13.669]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:17.592]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation.
[02:00:17.852 --> 02:00:20.474]  But during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:00:21.192 --> 02:00:27.019]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:00:27.339 --> 02:00:28.701]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:00:28.901 --> 02:00:36.189]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:00:36.449 --> 02:00:40.634]  Potassium Iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[02:00:40.854 --> 02:00:43.216]  It works by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:00:43.377 --> 02:00:48.101]  This shields the thyroid and protects it from absorbing the radioactive iodine-131.
[02:00:48.301 --> 02:00:55.208]  There's only one emergency thyroid blocker formulated for babies, children, pets and adults, and that's Medical Corps Potassium Iodate.
[02:00:55.408 --> 02:00:58.691]  Best of all, unopened bottles can be stored for up to a decade.
[02:00:58.952 --> 02:01:02.355]  Order the official Medical Corps Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:01:04.597 --> 02:01:05.378]  Call toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:01:05.398 --> 02:01:06.479]  Call now and get free shipping.
[02:01:06.499 --> 02:01:06.739]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:01:19.742 --> 02:01:20.382]  Big Brother.
[02:01:21.043 --> 02:01:22.103]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:22.824 --> 02:01:23.904]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:24.565 --> 02:01:25.385]  You want answers?
[02:01:26.146 --> 02:01:27.046]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:27.066 --> 02:01:31.309]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:31.889 --> 02:01:36.011]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:38.573 --> 02:01:43.636]  Monday through Friday, from 11 to 2 Central, and back from 9 to Midnight Central, we do the show.
[02:01:44.637 --> 02:01:53.826]  We've got one more call we're going to take and we're going to get back into news and information with George Humphrey, our guest, author of 9-1-1, The Great Illusion, a good friend of mine, an economist right here in Austin.
[02:01:54.707 --> 02:02:07.519]  But the last caller, who was making great points and I heard the enthusiasm in his voice and God blessing, the last caller from Virginia was raising the point about the House passing by the vast majority
[02:02:09.113 --> 02:02:20.121]  A law hadn't passed the Senate to take out Section 215, that's where they get your library records and bookstore records and other records without you knowing it.
[02:02:20.901 --> 02:02:28.767]  Now, it didn't get rid of Section 213 or other subsections, so it's like you got a hundred fists hitting you in the head and they pulled one of the punches.
[02:02:29.327 --> 02:02:38.193]  They're doing this because of heat on them, they're doing it because they're constituents, liberal, conservative, Christian, you know, cross the border, very angry and upset, and are reading the bill!
[02:02:38.985 --> 02:02:49.427]  Not listening to Ashcroft's incessant, pathological lying as he destroys the Constitution and robs us of our liberties like the klepto-bureaucrat he is.
[02:02:49.507 --> 02:02:53.028]  Now, the story is on Infowars.com.
[02:02:53.048 --> 02:02:55.308]  It's from CNS News, Conservative News Service.
[02:02:55.468 --> 02:03:02.830]  And understand, the Republican-run state of Alaska just voted last week to fully pull out of the Patriot Act.
[02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:08.611]  Ashcroft panicked and ran up there and said it was liberals lying, while it was Republicans that passed it because of their constituents.
[02:03:09.853 --> 02:03:10.854]  We got him caught cold.
[02:03:10.894 --> 02:03:12.355]  He said there wasn't a Patriot Act 2.
[02:03:12.395 --> 02:03:13.335]  Then he had to admit it.
[02:03:13.836 --> 02:03:18.439]  The thing's been introduced in the Senate 7 months and 18 days ago, okay?
[02:03:18.979 --> 02:03:22.842]  We've been covering it since day 1 in January 6 when it came out.
[02:03:23.322 --> 02:03:26.004]  I wrote the definitive analysis of it, not bragging, just fact.
[02:03:26.024 --> 02:03:27.665]  Please go read it at Infowars.com.
[02:03:27.926 --> 02:03:29.347]  Then check it in the bill for yourself.
[02:03:29.407 --> 02:03:31.128]  We have a link to it below the story.
[02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:33.421]  So here it is.
[02:03:33.621 --> 02:03:35.122]  We told you about secret executions.
[02:03:35.142 --> 02:03:35.923]  You couldn't believe it.
[02:03:35.963 --> 02:03:37.464]  Now it's been in a hundred newspapers.
[02:03:37.884 --> 02:03:38.064]  U.S.
[02:03:38.124 --> 02:03:40.546]  announces death chambers for anyone that commits any crime.
[02:03:41.046 --> 02:03:46.790]  Justice Department four weeks ago before the Congress enthusiastically said we'll use it for all crimes against misdemeanors.
[02:03:47.631 --> 02:03:50.913]  That was the head of the Justice Department policy there in the report.
[02:03:50.993 --> 02:03:51.834]  I mean, this is happening.
[02:03:53.015 --> 02:03:54.737]  We just take the time out to research this.
[02:03:54.777 --> 02:03:59.581]  They count on you to know all the baseball and football statistics, but to not know about the facts of this.
[02:03:59.681 --> 02:04:04.686]  Just shift into this and learn this, like you did football scores, and you'll know about the New World Order.
[02:04:05.847 --> 02:04:08.729]  Please focus your energies into real stuff, folks.
[02:04:09.169 --> 02:04:16.376]  Here it is, and I'm not bashing sports in and of themselves, but the mindless knowing all the statistics of that and not this will destroy you and your family.
[02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:18.841]  Proposed amendments of the U.S.A.
[02:04:18.901 --> 02:04:24.645]  Patriot Act, and the following is representative Bernie Sanders' independent Vermont bill that would amend the U.S.A.
[02:04:24.665 --> 02:04:28.568]  Patriot Act, which bills a myriad of modifications, and would remove section 215.
[02:04:30.009 --> 02:04:30.590]  And it's H.R.
[02:04:30.610 --> 02:04:30.590]  1157.
[02:04:30.810 --> 02:04:43.339]  And it's the armed, and to amend the Foreign Service Surveillance Act to exempt bookstores and libraries from orders requiring the production of any tangible things for certain foreign intelligence investigations, because it's all about domestic.
[02:04:44.507 --> 02:04:45.548]  So there's that.
[02:04:45.889 --> 02:04:46.429]  Here's another one.
[02:04:46.469 --> 02:04:52.254]  Judge dismisses NAACP lawsuit against gun makers, which angers Governor Pataki, the gun-grabbing Republican.
[02:04:52.775 --> 02:04:53.736]  Now this is Fox News.
[02:04:53.756 --> 02:04:54.276]  There's another one.
[02:04:54.296 --> 02:04:56.398]  Patriot Act upsets Delaware, other states.
[02:04:56.898 --> 02:04:58.100]  Hawaii, Alaska.
[02:04:58.200 --> 02:04:59.781]  Now it looks like Delaware is going to pull out.
[02:04:59.821 --> 02:05:01.282]  Looks like Utah is going to pull out.
[02:05:01.743 --> 02:05:03.264]  Orrin Hatch is trying to stop that.
[02:05:03.284 --> 02:05:06.547]  He also wants more tuition for illegal aliens than for citizens.
[02:05:06.587 --> 02:05:08.969]  That's out of the mainstream news today.
[02:05:09.009 --> 02:05:09.630]  That's coming up.
[02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:18.428]  Uh, so, they're in deep trouble, but I think there's a sneak attack coming here, George Humphrey, and we'll go to this final call for this half hour, then we'll get into news.
[02:05:19.608 --> 02:05:26.573]  There's a sneak attack here because they, in their own policies, have said, and I've heard the globalists giggle on TV, go ahead, amend the Patriot Act.
[02:05:26.793 --> 02:05:29.155]  When there's a bigger terrorist attack, it's going to be your fault.
[02:05:29.972 --> 02:05:38.274]  So they're going to allow this counter-revolution against them, they're going to use judo, carry out a terror attack, flip it around and say, you cost lives.
[02:05:38.654 --> 02:05:50.417]  We've got to add the addendum, the key caveat, it's larger than the bulk itself, and say, hey, we know you're going to carry out more terror, legitimize this, we know you're leaving the borders wide open and doing nothing to stop terror.
[02:05:51.037 --> 02:05:53.058]  How important is that point right now, George?
[02:05:53.339 --> 02:06:00.263]  I see a judo move, and you know my frank, frank insight into their machinations.
[02:06:00.283 --> 02:06:00.803]  Your comment?
[02:06:01.123 --> 02:06:07.868]  Well, number one, when you first get into politics, the first thing you learn is to follow the money, and you follow the power.
[02:06:08.328 --> 02:06:17.954]  And there is no question whatsoever that the group that is in power right now wants and desires more than anything else to stay in power.
[02:06:18.627 --> 02:06:31.113]  And they realize that by using Hegelian theory, thesis, antithesis, synthesis, or problem-reaction solution, they can easily manipulate the vast majority of American citizens.
[02:06:34.727 --> 02:06:36.828]  We're up to about 84 percent.
[02:06:37.148 --> 02:06:38.408]  They have been coming down.
[02:06:38.488 --> 02:06:40.468]  They hit the all-time high of 95 percent.
[02:06:40.509 --> 02:06:44.169]  Yeah, and I think they're at about 58 percent right now.
[02:06:44.850 --> 02:06:47.930]  Actually, in their mainstream polls, overall, he's at 53.
[02:06:48.331 --> 02:06:50.051]  A lot of polls show 45.
[02:06:50.231 --> 02:07:00.234]  So whatever the number is, but as soon as the number gets down below the magical number of 45 percent, is that they are going to start initiating.
[02:07:00.274 --> 02:07:01.674]  And they've already got this planned.
[02:07:02.826 --> 02:07:13.603]  I do not think that they will do, I think that there is going to be some sort of what is called an NBC, nuclear biological or chemical attack to create fear.
[02:07:13.623 --> 02:07:17.289]  Well the CFR has said Dallas, Cleveland, Denver will be hit.
[02:07:18.191 --> 02:07:19.211]  Yeah.
[02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:25.873]  And the fact is, is that these people operate off the fear of the American people.
[02:07:26.434 --> 02:07:28.314]  And it would be so easy for them.
[02:07:28.574 --> 02:07:36.697]  And I think that they will wait until the end of this year or early next year to institute another event.
[02:07:37.580 --> 02:07:41.724]  Because they want to create the fear so that that momentum carries over.
[02:07:41.744 --> 02:07:46.329]  And they're already setting it up, saying Saddam still is in control and is secretly going to launch the attack.
[02:07:46.610 --> 02:07:49.433]  Then that will legitimize their war.
[02:07:49.573 --> 02:07:53.277]  You know, they have numerous different options.
[02:07:54.638 --> 02:08:00.184]  And the fact is, I know that I don't know, but I do know that there is something coming
[02:08:00.845 --> 02:08:17.621]  And that as an American, I am doing my best to try and share these possibilities with other Americans so we don't respond in fear, so that we're not thrown backwards, so that we can stand up and look these people in the eyes and say, enough is enough.
[02:08:18.719 --> 02:08:24.861]  And I think that we've stymied them for a while about their attack on Iran.
[02:08:25.361 --> 02:08:32.663]  I think that they've realized that they've gone too far in Afghanistan and Iraq, and that we are now in a guerrilla war.
[02:08:32.823 --> 02:08:35.964]  But if they carry out more attacks, they can institute the national draft.
[02:08:35.984 --> 02:08:37.985]  There's an article on that today that they're announcing.
[02:08:38.285 --> 02:08:39.485]  They can activate that.
[02:08:39.605 --> 02:08:42.506]  Total imperial mobilization, to use Brzezinski's words.
[02:08:43.186 --> 02:08:46.307]  And 9-1-1 is clearly, George, the primer.
[02:08:46.707 --> 02:08:47.668]  Yes.
[02:08:48.208 --> 02:08:50.869]  It is not the capstone.
[02:08:51.249 --> 02:09:03.556]  It is the foundational event toward their drive, toward the closing chapter of totally destroying this country, moving us into a secular, atheistic, New World Order.
[02:09:03.976 --> 02:09:06.177]  Now, in my opinion, in your opinion,
[02:09:06.753 --> 02:09:06.993]  Absolutely.
[02:09:07.093 --> 02:09:08.715]  Let's take a call.
[02:09:08.795 --> 02:09:10.576]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve.
[02:09:10.616 --> 02:09:12.057]  Steve, where are you calling from today, sir?
[02:09:29.244 --> 02:09:29.664]  Can you hear me?
[02:09:29.984 --> 02:09:30.465]  Yes, sir.
[02:09:30.805 --> 02:09:32.125]  Yeah, I'm calling from Utah.
[02:09:32.245 --> 02:09:33.006]  Provo, Utah.
[02:09:33.106 --> 02:09:33.766]  Good to talk to you.
[02:09:33.806 --> 02:09:34.266]  Go ahead.
[02:09:34.586 --> 02:09:37.668]  I got a great idea on how to get the word out on your website.
[02:09:38.328 --> 02:09:40.769]  The idea came to me with campaign yard signs.
[02:09:41.490 --> 02:09:47.292]  And so a friend of mine, what we did is we put together a sign 42 inches long and 18 inches deep.
[02:09:47.872 --> 02:09:51.514]  It says in bright red bold print, forbidden information.
[02:09:51.854 --> 02:09:53.575]  And then there's a black line below that.
[02:09:54.153 --> 02:09:59.257]  And then below the black line it says, in even bigger letters, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:59.297 --> 02:10:04.361]  Now, I've been going to parades and working parade routes before the parades start.
[02:10:05.121 --> 02:10:07.764]  And I'd walk up, well, like the 4th of July parade I went.
[02:10:08.324 --> 02:10:10.005]  There must have been 100,000 people there.
[02:10:10.025 --> 02:10:11.546]  And I'd just walk up and down the street.
[02:10:11.626 --> 02:10:13.068]  I wouldn't say nothing to anybody.
[02:10:13.148 --> 02:10:19.332]  But as I was walking by, people's heads were turning from the left to the right as I was walking by.
[02:10:19.352 --> 02:10:23.516]  And you could see them mouth the words, forbidden information, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:10:24.685 --> 02:10:28.829]  And so I've worked three parades... You can see them committing it to memory.
[02:10:29.469 --> 02:10:29.869]  What's that?
[02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:31.791]  You can see them committing it to memory.
[02:10:32.211 --> 02:10:32.732]  That's right.
[02:10:33.493 --> 02:10:37.696]  And today I'm going to go up and get ready to work a parade route tomorrow.
[02:10:38.036 --> 02:10:48.205]  There'll be 200,000 people there and I'll just... and I'm going to work the parade route from 9 o'clock, 12 o'clock, midnight, till 6 in the morning and people will see it.
[02:10:48.789 --> 02:10:58.255]  And what's more is I plan on doing this during football games in the fall because at the football stadium here in town there'll be 65,000 people who are going to come see the game.
[02:10:58.275 --> 02:11:00.916]  I have to stand out there and hold the sign up and people see it.
[02:11:01.176 --> 02:11:02.277]  Well I want to tell you something.
[02:11:02.297 --> 02:11:03.097]  I want to tell you something.
[02:11:03.137 --> 02:11:03.978]  I've probably been sent
[02:11:05.117 --> 02:11:11.364]  Several hundred photos of people that have billboards and yard signs homemade in their yards for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:11:12.125 --> 02:11:16.150]  I have been sent photos, and I'm not saying do this, but it is interesting.
[02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:23.959]  People climb up on skyscrapers and spray paint it and on highways and on signs from New Zealand to Utah.
[02:11:25.502 --> 02:11:28.345]  And it is the guerrilla war in the information ward.
[02:11:28.365 --> 02:11:29.746]  George, what do you say about that?
[02:11:30.147 --> 02:11:39.655]  Well, first of all, I say thank you to the man who's on the phone for sharing this information, because as Sir Francis Bacon said, knowledge is power.
[02:11:40.056 --> 02:11:43.219]  And right now, it's all about information.
[02:11:46.476 --> 02:11:56.499]  By the way, the neocons in Ron Paul's speech, he quotes their top strategists as saying that we've got to keep the people from the information, we've got to control them with misinformation.
[02:11:56.539 --> 02:12:01.640]  I mean, they say this knowing people will never read their published books or call them on it.
[02:12:02.721 --> 02:12:07.482]  Well, you know what's interesting is, instead of the people coming to the billboard, I take the billboard to the people.
[02:12:08.423 --> 02:12:10.984]  And I'm not intrusive.
[02:12:11.044 --> 02:12:12.285]  I don't say anything to anybody.
[02:12:12.325 --> 02:12:15.126]  If people ask me a question, I'll answer the question.
[02:12:15.566 --> 02:12:20.168]  And I'll refer to the Patriot Act or the Homeland Security Act and how evil it is.
[02:12:20.568 --> 02:12:22.989]  And then I say, you know why they call prisonplanet.com?
[02:12:23.009 --> 02:12:24.209]  They'll go, no, why?
[02:12:24.529 --> 02:12:30.792]  I'll say, because if you don't have the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights, you live in a prison planet.
[02:12:31.272 --> 02:12:32.652]  And then the connection is drawn.
[02:12:32.672 --> 02:12:33.953]  They go, yeah, I'll go to the website.
[02:12:34.639 --> 02:12:39.544]  But what's amazing is wherever there's a large amount of people, you don't have to say anything.
[02:12:39.564 --> 02:12:41.065]  You stand on public property.
[02:12:41.085 --> 02:12:42.526]  You don't stand on private property.
[02:12:42.787 --> 02:12:43.888]  You just hold the sign up.
[02:12:43.928 --> 02:12:44.808]  People walk by.
[02:12:44.828 --> 02:12:45.409]  You can see them.
[02:12:45.469 --> 02:12:46.210]  Mouth the word.
[02:12:46.530 --> 02:12:47.531]  Forbidden information.
[02:12:47.611 --> 02:12:48.932]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:12:49.213 --> 02:12:53.136]  If other people would do this in other states, we can get the word out en masse.
[02:12:53.456 --> 02:12:55.198]  Well done, friend.
[02:12:56.139 --> 02:12:56.699]  Absolutely.
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:57.560]  Steve, you're beautiful.
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:12:58.201]  God bless you.
[02:12:58.221 --> 02:12:59.262]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:13:00.074 --> 02:13:05.320]  No, I'm going to work the parade route tomorrow and there's going to be 200,000 people there and I'm going to walk up and down the parade route.
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:05.981]  Hey, where is that going to be?
[02:13:06.021 --> 02:13:07.863]  Where is that going to be if folks want to come join you?
[02:13:07.903 --> 02:13:08.443]  Lake City.
[02:13:09.645 --> 02:13:11.146]  Alright, and what's the parade for?
[02:13:11.426 --> 02:13:11.647]  Evans.
[02:13:12.448 --> 02:13:12.968]  Alright, thank you.
[02:13:12.988 --> 02:13:13.549]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:17.069 --> 02:13:17.589]  It's here.
[02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:18.570]  It's powerful.
[02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:27.456]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[02:13:27.756 --> 02:13:29.597]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[02:13:29.858 --> 02:13:31.939]  No need for expensive, disposable filters.
[02:13:32.199 --> 02:13:36.483]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[02:13:36.743 --> 02:13:42.428]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[02:13:42.649 --> 02:13:44.410]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[02:13:44.570 --> 02:13:47.793]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.

[02:15:12.978 --> 02:15:19.205]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:15:19.665 --> 02:15:27.433]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:15:27.774 --> 02:15:35.622]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:15:35.942 --> 02:15:40.683]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:15:41.023 --> 02:15:45.724]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:15:46.244 --> 02:15:50.085]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:15:50.605 --> 02:15:51.605]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:16:12.036 --> 02:16:13.838]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:16:13.998 --> 02:16:19.643]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:16:19.964 --> 02:16:20.824]  Probably never, right?

[02:17:17.492 --> 02:17:23.535]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:17:24.135 --> 02:17:27.156]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:33.099 --> 02:17:34.439]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:34.859 --> 02:17:36.420]  George Humphrey is our guest.
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:42.903]  He has written two other books and two powerful audio books.
[02:17:43.658 --> 02:17:45.059]  Common Sense and Uncommon Sense.
[02:17:45.099 --> 02:17:49.882]  Now he has 9-1-1, The Great Illusion, The Illuminati, Endgame, Your Choice, Fear or Love.
[02:17:51.043 --> 02:17:56.186]  And George, for the next 15 minutes or so, I just want to get into some key points that you want to cover about The Globalist.
[02:17:56.686 --> 02:17:57.567]  Some of the news items.
[02:17:57.587 --> 02:18:01.890]  I want to throw some other news points at you and then I want to take calls for the last 15 minutes or so.
[02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:04.271]  But go ahead and launch into whatever you'd like to talk about.
[02:18:04.291 --> 02:18:06.693]  Well, I think the key right now is
[02:18:08.619 --> 02:18:21.225]  The key in waking up the American people has to be 9-1-1, because the administration and the NSA and the FBI and all the other power elite, they are all keying off of this.
[02:18:21.865 --> 02:18:34.091]  And the facts are so clear and so brazenly out there that the information that we have been given about what happened before
[02:18:34.784 --> 02:18:44.088]  During and after 9-1-1, as presented to us by the corporate media, are so blatantly and factually false.
[02:18:44.808 --> 02:18:54.573]  And you and others have done just a tremendous job at factually pointing out, point by point, what's going on.
[02:18:55.013 --> 02:19:01.416]  And what I have done is that I have put together a little booklet, 70 pages, with 45 colored pictures,
[02:19:02.577 --> 02:19:03.137]  I think so.
[02:19:15.795 --> 02:19:34.867]  On your website, and I've also got a booklet on this, is that they can go through, they can spend about two hours just looking at this, and that they can come away with the factual information about what is being told to us, which is absolutely, bizarrely false.
[02:19:35.848 --> 02:19:41.651]  And that, and when people start understanding that the information concerning 9-1-1,
[02:19:43.470 --> 02:19:52.217]  ...has been so misrepresented to us, that awakens the righteous indignation within people.
[02:19:52.497 --> 02:20:00.484]  For example, today I was at the tennis courts, a fairly conservative club, and all these women came up to me and they said, you know what?
[02:20:01.104 --> 02:20:05.328]  We've read your... and these are Bush Republicans, and they said, you know what?
[02:20:05.368 --> 02:20:08.530]  We've read your booklet and we didn't want to believe it.
[02:20:08.610 --> 02:20:10.412]  We didn't believe it, but you know what?
[02:20:11.587 --> 02:20:14.169]  What you're saying is so important and so true.
[02:20:14.529 --> 02:20:19.213]  Now, they still support Bush, but they're questioning right now.
[02:20:19.633 --> 02:20:24.176]  And that's what we have to do, is that we have to spread the seeds of information.
[02:20:24.576 --> 02:20:33.203]  And hopefully these seeds will be planted in places that are fertile, where the human mind is still somewhat awake.
[02:20:33.263 --> 02:20:35.264]  Well, George, let me throw a few points out here.
[02:20:36.345 --> 02:20:38.867]  You're a very successful businessman, real estate owner.
[02:20:38.907 --> 02:20:40.448]  You've come out with clothing lines.
[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:42.240]  You know, all this stuff.
[02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:47.962]  And you got involved and spent probably about half your time working on this fight because you love America.
[02:20:48.183 --> 02:20:56.566]  And in this fight, we have to get people to realize that if they are middle class or upper class, they have even more to lose.
[02:20:57.306 --> 02:21:05.329]  Because this system targets everyone and is going to repossess the pension funds, the private property, everything.
[02:21:05.369 --> 02:21:08.250]  And so many middle class people think they're part of this system.
[02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:21.966]  But getting back into 9-1-1, I mean, we reported this a year and a half ago, but it's now admitted in the mainstream, their own government report, that, oh yeah, a bunch of the hijackers had FBI and FBI informants living with them and paid for their houses, their cars, their credit cards.
[02:21:21.986 --> 02:21:23.507]  Yeah, they were trained at military bases.
[02:21:23.547 --> 02:21:24.948]  Yeah, a bunch of them are still alive.
[02:21:25.568 --> 02:21:26.849]  And they just leave it at that.
[02:21:27.229 --> 02:21:28.709]  I mean, they ran this operation.
[02:21:28.729 --> 02:21:31.911]  The so-called hijackers were just there to be seen at the scenes of the crime.
[02:21:32.291 --> 02:21:35.993]  They've been proven to be an Assad FBI and MI6 agents.
[02:21:36.873 --> 02:21:37.994]  It's totally staged.
[02:21:39.832 --> 02:21:53.535]  It's so bizarre, because not only one or two points, but point after point after point can totally turn the tables, and the American corporate press is just ignoring it.
[02:21:53.795 --> 02:22:06.458]  The fact is, is that on the day of 9-1-1, this woman in Jersey City looks up, out of her house, on top of the next door building, are six people who are filming the first plane.
[02:22:07.651 --> 02:22:08.333]  Yes, we are.
[02:22:14.752 --> 02:22:18.075]  She thinks it's a bunch of Arab terrorists.
[02:22:18.095 --> 02:22:21.498]  They arrest them, go to the company, and turns out it's a Mossad operation.
[02:22:21.598 --> 02:22:22.279]  Absolutely.
[02:22:22.679 --> 02:22:25.982]  And as soon as that information comes out, it dies.
[02:22:26.482 --> 02:22:27.383]  No information.
[02:22:27.423 --> 02:22:42.516]  The next day, in Ohio, they catch a bunch of guys in a moving truck in the same company that employed the first group, and they had explosives and the plans for nuclear power reactors in Florida.
[02:22:43.198 --> 02:22:48.440]  Not only is this information suppressed, but all these people are allowed to go back to Israel.
[02:22:48.460 --> 02:22:52.462]  And by the way, the cops that busted them deserve million-dollar rewards.
[02:22:52.662 --> 02:22:53.502]  That's good.
[02:22:53.602 --> 02:22:55.243]  They saved a lot of lives.
[02:22:55.803 --> 02:23:00.064]  And if they'd have gotten those reactors to go off, imagine the police state we'd be in right now, George.
[02:23:01.125 --> 02:23:01.905]  We'll be right back.
[02:23:02.245 --> 02:23:02.825]  This is a fact.
[02:23:02.865 --> 02:23:03.526]  Mainstream news.
[02:23:05.306 --> 02:23:06.207]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.707 --> 02:23:08.307]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.228 --> 02:23:11.909]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.026 --> 02:23:17.769]  You're losing your hair and you haven't tried Avacor yet?
[02:23:18.209 --> 02:23:20.651]  You've heard all about it on radio and TV for years.
[02:23:20.872 --> 02:23:24.855]  Well, there's a reason why Avacor has become the most recognized name in hair regrowth.
[02:23:25.156 --> 02:23:26.897]  Simply because... 888-803-4438 Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438
[02:23:49.819 --> 02:23:59.026]  All right, Regina, Paul, Rodney, Todd, Ron, and others, your calls are all coming up here in about 10 minutes or so.
[02:23:59.927 --> 02:24:02.529]  Got a bunch of news I want to run through and just get George's take on.
[02:24:03.210 --> 02:24:18.442]  Before we do that, George Humphrey, I am carrying your three, it's three plus hours, how long is your incredible audio book on CD or on cassette, 9-1-1, The Great Illusion, The Illuminati's End Game, Your Choice, Fear or Love?
[02:24:19.692 --> 02:24:20.833]  How long exactly is it?
[02:24:21.714 --> 02:24:24.676]  Oh, I don't know to the minute, but it's approximately three hours.
[02:24:24.696 --> 02:24:26.558]  Yeah, I think it's a little bit over three.
[02:24:26.918 --> 02:24:32.222]  And if I do say so myself, the guy who did the production did a wonderful job.
[02:24:33.703 --> 02:24:38.707]  The person who did the voice has a great sense of humor and is very, very listenable.
[02:24:39.388 --> 02:24:41.109]  And it came out very nicely.
[02:24:41.129 --> 02:24:42.991]  And if you will listen to this,
[02:24:43.573 --> 02:24:52.743]  Or give it, if you give it to a friend, give it to a friend who is a skeptic, and if they will listen to it, it will change their point of view.
[02:24:53.243 --> 02:25:03.054]  Absolutely, and George, it's $18.95 to get the 3 hour 2 CD or audio cassette set, and you get 2 of the books.
[02:25:03.601 --> 02:25:03.801]  I think?
[02:25:25.041 --> 02:25:27.963]  You know, to and from work, the average commute time is 45 minutes.
[02:25:28.483 --> 02:25:35.107]  In two or three days, they can listen to the whole thing, and it'll change lives, and we're carrying it.
[02:25:35.507 --> 02:25:45.152]  You can also, for $15, get five of the books, or you can get, for $18.95, the CD or cassette package, with the two booklets free, for $18.95.
[02:25:45.293 --> 02:25:51.276]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, click through to the shopping card,
[02:25:52.034 --> 02:25:55.076]  The area that says, by other insightful authors.
[02:25:55.577 --> 02:25:59.760]  Click there and you'll see George's other books and tapes, but the new one is 9-1-1, The Great Illusion.
[02:26:00.861 --> 02:26:07.646]  And your purchase also supports this broadcast and my team and what we're doing getting the word out worldwide in our filmmaking.
[02:26:07.666 --> 02:26:12.650]  So please go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get 9-1-1, The Great Illusion.
[02:26:12.910 --> 02:26:15.252]  Get my film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:26:15.712 --> 02:26:18.835]  Get my part two of that, Masters of Terror, both over two hours long.
[02:26:19.335 --> 02:26:26.858]  We have Rotetarian on DVD and VHS, Get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, Police Day 2000, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:26:27.098 --> 02:26:29.459]  George, you've seen, I think, most of my nine videos.
[02:26:29.479 --> 02:26:31.660]  Which one do you think people should get out there?
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:44.746]  Well, I think the last couple of videos that you've made is the quality... You know, I've known Alex since he first started on this stuff, and his quality of video and audios
[02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:50.283]  Has been improving and improving, and your last three have been just home runs, Alex.
[02:26:50.663 --> 02:26:53.384]  Just absolute, total home runs.
[02:26:53.785 --> 02:27:02.069]  Your graphics are better, your presentations are getting more and more powerful, and you've done just a beautiful job.
[02:27:02.589 --> 02:27:10.133]  And so, one of the things I would say to your listeners is that when you either order Alex's or my tapes or videos,
[02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:19.744]  Not only do you get a very, very powerful piece of information for yourself and your friends, but you're supporting Alex and his group.
[02:27:21.885 --> 02:27:24.227]  How he does this, this does not come free.
[02:27:24.547 --> 02:27:32.571]  He's got people who are working for him, there's a lot of overhead that a lot of you are not aware of, and it also helps the Genesis station.
[02:27:33.131 --> 02:27:34.191]  So it's a win-win-win.
[02:27:34.512 --> 02:27:36.553]  His prices are very reasonable.
[02:27:40.214 --> 02:27:46.300]  Well, George, I appreciate the sentiment.
[02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:46.941]  It's wonderful.
[02:27:47.541 --> 02:27:57.172]  At the same time, I authorize my listeners to make copies of my videos, because they're like mini printing presses, and that's where the power comes in, is in the people taking action.
[02:27:57.192 --> 02:28:01.657]  You know, my dad's a consultant for a big Fortune 500 medical infrastructure.
[02:28:02.569 --> 02:28:11.843]  And he goes around, he'll be in a hotel room in Chicago or a hotel room in Kansas City or a hotel room, you know, in Washington State or a hotel room in Houston.
[02:28:12.203 --> 02:28:13.405]  This has happened like five times.
[02:28:13.445 --> 02:28:16.930]  He turns on the cable and there's his son's videos on Access.
[02:28:18.037 --> 02:28:24.424]  Or he turns it on to the Trio Network, and there is a footage I've shot on national TV, commercial TV, about Bohemian Grove.
[02:28:24.444 --> 02:28:27.046]  But the point is, I started my fight 8 years ago.
[02:28:27.087 --> 02:28:28.288]  You started yours 10 years ago.
[02:28:28.968 --> 02:28:32.212]  And we have seen the seeds bear incredible fruit.
[02:28:32.312 --> 02:28:33.173]  Huge harvest.
[02:28:33.693 --> 02:28:36.356]  But there's not enough of us getting the word out fast enough.
[02:28:36.914 --> 02:28:45.582]  Yeah, and the main point is, this is not about Alex, or myself, or David Icke, or any other leading the way.
[02:28:45.983 --> 02:28:49.746]  This has to be a grassroots revolution.
[02:28:50.207 --> 02:29:02.238]  And one of the things that I say every time on my television show, is that not only is this an economic, political, and a cultural battle, this is a time of spiritual choice.
[02:29:02.981 --> 02:29:12.971]  And each and every person listening has much more latent, divine, wonderful power than most of you give yourself credit for.
[02:29:13.372 --> 02:29:18.117]  And each and every person listening to this is a part of the solution.
[02:29:18.417 --> 02:29:19.718]  You can all do things.
[02:29:19.738 --> 02:29:21.360]  You can all print out letters.
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:24.703]  You can all start your own cable access.
[02:29:24.743 --> 02:29:26.165]  You can all write booklets.
[02:29:26.747 --> 02:29:29.189]  We need every single one of you.
[02:29:29.329 --> 02:29:33.973]  Well, that's what happened in 1776, George.
[02:29:34.874 --> 02:29:36.415]  And we've got to have that awakening.
[02:29:36.435 --> 02:29:41.940]  And it was a decade of information warfare before that revolution began physically.
[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:46.643]  And we're trying to avert the physical conflict, because even the globalists say the pen is mightier.
[02:29:46.704 --> 02:29:51.628]  They say their info war is more important than all their physical manifestations, because it would fail
[02:29:52.449 --> 02:29:53.671]  If the people knew the truth.
[02:29:53.731 --> 02:29:55.213]  Now, even their own minions are waking up.
[02:29:55.233 --> 02:29:57.757]  Let me throw out about 20 news articles.
[02:29:57.838 --> 02:29:58.439]  I'll throw one out.
[02:29:58.479 --> 02:29:59.881]  I'll spend 15 seconds on one.
[02:30:00.202 --> 02:30:01.524]  Give us a 30 second comment.
[02:30:02.586 --> 02:30:05.010]  And then we're going to go to calls for the loaded phones here.
[02:30:06.034 --> 02:30:06.454]  4,500 U.S.
[02:30:07.275 --> 02:30:10.197]  troops might head to Liberia.
[02:30:10.237 --> 02:30:12.338]  That's the Associated Press byline.
[02:30:12.398 --> 02:30:16.942]  They said years ago it's about getting control of the diamonds, the oil, and the gold.
[02:30:17.262 --> 02:30:17.942]  That was admitted.
[02:30:18.022 --> 02:30:24.126]  Now they've got their excuse, and it's a political diversion and smoke screen for the other bad things that are happening for the globalists.
[02:30:24.387 --> 02:30:25.067]  George comments.
[02:30:25.087 --> 02:30:26.488]  It's just amazing.
[02:30:27.008 --> 02:30:30.030]  Afghanistan, Iraq, Liberia.
[02:30:30.571 --> 02:30:32.312]  Minerals, minerals, minerals.
[02:30:32.805 --> 02:30:33.706]  Follow the money.
[02:30:33.946 --> 02:30:41.012]  And if you watch, read the reports in the papers, it's saying all these Liberian people are coming and asking that the Americans come.
[02:30:41.512 --> 02:30:42.373]  Baloney.
[02:30:42.673 --> 02:30:44.094]  That's just absolute baloney.
[02:30:44.154 --> 02:30:58.907]  But George, the British news and the foreign news and the African news reported that when Bush landed in some of these countries, they would have protesters by the thousands rounded up, put in the scoops, and put in sports stadiums under machine gun with U.S.
[02:30:58.947 --> 02:31:00.588]  Special Forces overseeing it.
[02:31:02.463 --> 02:31:03.284]  What more can you say?
[02:31:22.358 --> 02:31:27.300]  Well, as we've said before, is that the possibility of another Hegelian event is very, very real.
[02:31:27.421 --> 02:31:31.322]  And all of us have to realize that the current law that we have right now
[02:31:51.099 --> 02:31:57.428]  Every hour, every day that we have is that we have to prepare ourselves, our family, our friends.
[02:31:58.038 --> 02:32:02.480]  to become stronger and healthier and more in love with our life.
[02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:14.487]  And George, it's not really a lull because they're putting in the control grids, putting in the biometrics, putting in the RFIDs, opening the borders, bringing in the foreign troops, raising 100 to 200 billion dollar Merck armies.
[02:32:14.767 --> 02:32:17.188]  Read five articles on air about that yesterday.
[02:32:17.268 --> 02:32:18.589]  Quote, they wear black uniforms.
[02:32:18.629 --> 02:32:19.630]  I can re-read that article.
[02:32:19.930 --> 02:32:22.391]  They're announcing that torture is acceptable in British courts.
[02:32:22.711 --> 02:32:23.111]  Have that.
[02:32:23.151 --> 02:32:24.292]  London Guardian yesterday.
[02:32:24.372 --> 02:32:28.135]  A billion dollars a week in Iraq for a police action.
[02:32:28.595 --> 02:32:30.496]  It's unbelievable, friends.
[02:32:30.936 --> 02:32:35.579]  And when I say law, that is relative to what we could be facing.
[02:32:35.780 --> 02:32:38.762]  I would say that the first wave of the hurricane passed us.
[02:32:39.162 --> 02:32:41.984]  We're now in the eye of it, and it's accelerating rotation.
[02:32:43.305 --> 02:32:43.845]  Good analogy.
[02:32:44.657 --> 02:32:48.599]  Okay, let's, uh, from 50 miles an hour to 10 million miles an hour, folks.
[02:32:48.619 --> 02:32:49.499]  We're not joking here.
[02:32:49.739 --> 02:32:50.680]  Uh, next story.
[02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:52.281]  National Draft for you and your family.
[02:32:52.301 --> 02:32:53.141]  Already mentioned this.
[02:32:53.241 --> 02:32:55.722]  Warning of toxic aftermath from uranium munitions.
[02:32:56.482 --> 02:33:05.146]  Former Major Douglas Rook, who was a rector of the Army's Depleted Uranium Project, says the troops are dead and dying from it over the last 12 years, and it is deadly.
[02:33:05.566 --> 02:33:06.967]  Again, quick comment on that, George.
[02:33:07.287 --> 02:33:13.250]  Well, one one ten thousandth of an ounce of depleted uranium, if ingested in your lungs,
[02:33:13.757 --> 02:33:32.027]  That are both alpha and beta, which in depleted uranium can emit both what's called a low-level alpha or beta emission, can and will cause a cancer, and we're not talking about ounces or pounds, we're talking about hundreds and hundreds of pounds.
[02:33:32.047 --> 02:33:34.268]  They're now talking about thousands of tons, George.
[02:33:34.408 --> 02:33:34.768]  Correct.
[02:33:35.148 --> 02:33:39.091]  That have been scattered indiscriminately around Iraq.
[02:33:39.431 --> 02:33:41.292]  This is absolute
[02:33:42.673 --> 02:33:43.915]  Don't forget Eastern Europe.
[02:33:45.256 --> 02:33:52.606]  Men ordered to stay in on Ladies Night, a big town city in Spain, ABC News is reporting.
[02:33:53.026 --> 02:33:59.194]  They've decided to tell men they can't leave their houses at night once a week, so they'll be better feminists.
[02:33:59.714 --> 02:34:06.816]  The mayor of Southern Spanish Town has declared Thursday's Ladies' Night and says he will fight any man found strolling about town in the evening.
[02:34:06.836 --> 02:34:17.958]  A spokesman for the recently elected regional party mayor, Javier Chaca, says the curfew is an attempt to encourage men to stay at home and do the chores.
[02:34:18.258 --> 02:34:19.579]  Now see, it's all giggly funny.
[02:34:19.799 --> 02:34:21.719]  That's total... Stalin didn't do that!
[02:34:21.759 --> 02:34:23.820]  But see, now it's giggly fun, maybe.
[02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:24.720]  Comments, George.
[02:34:26.021 --> 02:34:29.827]  Well, Javier, I hope that you will reconsider what you're doing.
[02:34:29.887 --> 02:34:35.394]  I don't think that this will last, but this is another step in the insanity of political correctness.
[02:34:38.004 --> 02:34:41.947]  The 15-year-old with a 3.85 and an accredited New York College.
[02:34:42.547 --> 02:34:44.349]  No criminal record.
[02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:46.470]  Her father a successful businessman and her mother.
[02:34:47.011 --> 02:34:51.914]  They would not put her in public school and they're coming to arrest him now with criminal charges saying it's abusive.
[02:34:51.974 --> 02:34:52.355]  Comments?
[02:34:52.755 --> 02:34:59.260]  Well, Child Protective Services throughout this country is one of the most dangerous organizations.
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:02.262]  They've been doing Patriot Act stuff for years.
[02:35:15.311 --> 02:35:15.531]  No.
[02:35:15.772 --> 02:35:29.704]  Well, just like the heads of the FBI, the five people that blocked the investigation of the so-called hijackers, got record cash bonuses between $15,000 and $30,000, CPS gets bonuses for breaking up families.
[02:35:30.184 --> 02:35:30.524]  Correct.
[02:35:31.245 --> 02:35:37.110]  And clearly, is that the power elite, the Illuminati, many, many years ago, through Adam Weishauf,
[02:35:37.546 --> 02:35:46.309]  Realize that one of the ways of destroying the American Constitution and the American culture was to destabilize and fracture the American family.
[02:35:46.329 --> 02:35:50.270]  And Bush just signed on to UNESCO and their official document says, quote, the family's a disease.
[02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:53.031]  UPI investigates the vaccine conflict.
[02:35:53.171 --> 02:35:54.551]  UPI, July 20th.
[02:35:54.991 --> 02:35:57.752]  The screaming started four hours after an eight-month-old chase.
[02:35:58.653 --> 02:36:08.299]  Irons received a vaccination against the retrovirus recommended in June 98 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for every infant to prevent serious diarrhea.
[02:36:08.819 --> 02:36:11.821]  Within a day, he was vomiting and eliminating blood.
[02:36:12.361 --> 02:36:17.824]  Doctors performed emergency surgery, saving him, repairing his intestines, which were folding in on one another.
[02:36:17.864 --> 02:36:20.946]  A doctor later figured out that the vaccine caused Chase's problem.
[02:36:21.366 --> 02:36:34.613]  In October 1999, after 15 reports of such incidents, the CDC withdrew its recommendations from the vaccination, not because of the problem, but the agency claims that because bad publicity might have given vaccines in general a bad name.
[02:36:35.173 --> 02:36:44.478]  But a four-month investigation by Antipress International found a pattern of serious problems linked to vaccines recommended by the CDC and a web of close ties between the agency and companies that make the vaccine.
[02:36:45.609 --> 02:36:48.610]  Autism is up 2,000 percent, up from 1,000 percent a year ago.
[02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:50.190]  It's not over diagnosis.
[02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:54.011]  The kid's 18 months old, gets a shot, is drooling in the corner for the rest of their life.
[02:36:54.291 --> 02:36:56.632]  They found hormones in it that attack the cerebral cortex.
[02:36:56.912 --> 02:36:58.333]  Bush moved to block those documents.
[02:36:58.353 --> 02:36:59.233]  They still were leaked.
[02:36:59.733 --> 02:37:04.034]  These are IQ reduction attack salvos just out of Brave New World.
[02:37:04.114 --> 02:37:07.195]  As Huxley said, he got it all from his brother, the first head of UNESCO.
[02:37:07.615 --> 02:37:08.995]  George comments on this nightmare.
[02:37:09.035 --> 02:37:18.218]  It's nine pages long of children bleeding out of their brains, out of their hind ends, dying, flopping around, blood everywhere, going into seizures right after the injections.
[02:37:18.238 --> 02:37:18.938]  What do you say to that?
[02:37:19.098 --> 02:37:29.221]  Well, just factual information is that most of the vaccines now, only 3% of the vaccine is actually the vaccine.
[02:37:29.241 --> 02:37:35.002]  95-97% of the vaccine is a combination of different ingredients.
[02:37:35.703 --> 02:37:41.111]  And in most cases, the doctors and the nurses have no idea what's going in there.
[02:37:41.512 --> 02:37:51.927]  Empirical forensic information shows that there is mercury, there's animal bacteria, there are retroviruses in there.
[02:37:53.287 --> 02:37:56.168]  Dr. Len Horowitz has done a very commendable job.
[02:37:56.188 --> 02:38:00.069]  It was SV40 and ugly cancer, which they admit they found in sewage systems now.
[02:38:00.409 --> 02:38:02.090]  It spreads even if you don't take it.
[02:38:02.690 --> 02:38:06.891]  And they passed a law in Texas, as the headlines said, so you wouldn't have to take vaccines.
[02:38:06.931 --> 02:38:08.031]  That law was already there.
[02:38:08.071 --> 02:38:11.572]  The new law said CPS can't take your kids if you refuse.
[02:38:12.233 --> 02:38:14.453]  Let's take some quick calls and we'll get back into quick news.
[02:38:14.493 --> 02:38:15.774]  I know some of the callers hung up.
[02:38:17.274 --> 02:38:18.294]  Who is still there, Mark?
[02:38:18.374 --> 02:38:20.055]  Regina, Paul, Michael?
[02:38:21.550 --> 02:38:23.731]  Rodney, Todd, Ron, who's still there?
[02:38:25.852 --> 02:38:27.693]  Okay, Regina, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:38:28.814 --> 02:38:42.900]  Yes, I just wanted to get in the UNESCO, because as you talk about the children and youth services, under this UNESCO, which Mr. Ron Paul is trying desperately to rid us of paying for, even though they just defunded it in the House.
[02:38:45.061 --> 02:38:46.341]  They defunded UNESCO?
[02:38:46.361 --> 02:38:47.362]  The vote's been coming?
[02:38:48.002 --> 02:38:51.983]  The AP reported last week that they stripped the funding.
[02:38:53.623 --> 02:38:54.043]  That's good news.
[02:38:54.063 --> 02:38:55.183]  I didn't get any record of that.
[02:38:55.244 --> 02:39:03.345]  I got an American Policy Center alert yesterday on HR 2799, the Department of Commerce Justice.
[02:39:03.365 --> 02:39:05.486]  There may be other bills to try to fund it.
[02:39:05.586 --> 02:39:05.866]  Okay.
[02:39:06.446 --> 02:39:08.366]  And Judiciary Appropriations.
[02:39:08.426 --> 02:39:13.327]  They did the UN, and I sent you the roll call count, they did on stop funding at UN.
[02:39:13.367 --> 02:39:17.228]  So it's 74 that voted with Ron Paul to stop the funding of the UN.
[02:39:18.047 --> 02:39:21.508]  And I was hoping you'd get a chance to look at the roll call vote on that, Alex.
[02:39:22.269 --> 02:39:23.209]  It was real interesting.
[02:39:23.229 --> 02:39:24.290]  Okay, real quick, Regina.
[02:39:24.330 --> 02:39:30.852]  This is, right now, they appear to be back to this bill, the Commerce State Justice Judiciary Appropriations Act, H.R.
[02:39:30.872 --> 02:39:30.852]  2799.
[02:39:31.193 --> 02:39:35.034]  Stop the United States from funding and rejoining UNESCO.
[02:39:35.354 --> 02:39:39.456]  You need to support the Ron Paul Amendment to do this under H.R.
[02:39:39.476 --> 02:39:39.456]  2799.
[02:39:40.977 --> 02:39:44.178]  Talking about the children and youth.
[02:39:44.651 --> 02:39:52.734]  Yeah, they're funding the child-grabbing.
[02:39:52.874 --> 02:39:54.654]  Thanks for the call, Regina.
[02:39:54.914 --> 02:39:55.775]  Paul in Texas.
[02:39:55.835 --> 02:39:56.655]  Paul, you're on the air.
[02:39:56.695 --> 02:39:57.155]  Go ahead.
[02:39:58.976 --> 02:40:00.016]  Thank you.
[02:40:00.056 --> 02:40:00.456]  Go ahead.
[02:40:01.397 --> 02:40:06.338]  I'm here in Austin, actually, and I've got a local question specifically for you, George.
[02:40:06.998 --> 02:40:11.840]  You probably still have some connections and friends on the city council and know people in the city government.
[02:40:13.143 --> 02:40:15.764]  And I've been watching all these cameras go up on South Mopac.
[02:40:15.925 --> 02:40:16.645]  Isn't it amazing?
[02:40:16.665 --> 02:40:18.086]  What are you talking about?
[02:40:18.126 --> 02:40:19.206]  They're in my neighborhood.
[02:40:19.226 --> 02:40:19.506]  Yeah.
[02:40:19.847 --> 02:40:24.209]  There's one on top of what's going to be an Amber Alert sign.
[02:40:24.229 --> 02:40:25.230]  I know that for sure.
[02:40:26.210 --> 02:40:30.172]  And I tell my friends about it and they just say, well, it's for highway control.
[02:40:30.192 --> 02:40:31.813]  And this, that, and the other.
[02:40:31.873 --> 02:40:38.777]  And then last week I went under the intersection of Mopac and Bee Cave and there's eight new cameras.
[02:40:38.837 --> 02:40:38.977]  Right.
[02:40:38.997 --> 02:40:42.339]  So they're in neighborhoods now with microphones.
[02:40:43.382 --> 02:40:51.863]  And they're pointing down, it could be for traffic control, because each one is pointed to where it can film whoever's in the driver's seat of that particular lane.
[02:40:51.963 --> 02:40:54.424]  DARPA said two weeks ago, the Pentagon's face scanning.
[02:40:54.444 --> 02:41:03.845]  Yeah, they are face scanning, and the amazing thing is, I went down to the Austin City Council yesterday to try to hand deliver a letter.
[02:41:05.286 --> 02:41:06.906]  I'm a former city council member.
[02:41:07.426 --> 02:41:12.747]  I couldn't even get in to the Austin City Council, to the building.
[02:41:13.436 --> 02:41:17.781]  They have a big old, you know, and I'm not against the police, he's just doing his job.
[02:41:17.821 --> 02:41:20.143]  But they're turning into armored secret police compounds.
[02:41:20.163 --> 02:41:22.506]  You can't even talk to your council members.
[02:41:22.967 --> 02:41:32.317]  They informed me that I had to go three miles away and deliver this to an office three miles away and when you cannot even talk
[02:41:33.044 --> 02:41:40.349]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:40.529 --> 02:41:44.952]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.113 --> 02:41:49.476]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:41:49.576 --> 02:41:50.857]  A New World Order.
[02:41:51.657 --> 02:41:52.597]  Panama.
[02:41:52.657 --> 02:41:56.878]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:56.938 --> 02:42:03.860]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:06.100]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:06.380 --> 02:42:16.803]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:17.003 --> 02:42:18.623]  If you want to understand what the new world order
[02:42:18.663 --> 02:42:19.163]  It really is.
[02:42:19.324 --> 02:42:22.386]  Then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:43:16.403 --> 02:43:22.325]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[02:43:35.328 --> 02:43:38.670]  If you're like most Americans, you've heard how low interest rates are these days.
[02:43:38.750 --> 02:43:40.870]  So why are you still struggling to pay off debt?
[02:43:41.170 --> 02:43:43.691]  Rates on debt consolidation loans are at all-time lows.

[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:00.420]  Slow credit?
[02:44:00.561 --> 02:44:01.101]  Bad credit?

[02:44:23.275 --> 02:44:23.335]  1-800-794-2858.
[02:44:38.958 --> 02:44:47.725]  The government, the government is insulating itself, surrounding itself by armored compounds, the police stations, the prisons, the FEMA command centers.
[02:44:47.765 --> 02:44:50.607]  They admit they have a concentration camp facility at the old airport.
[02:44:50.687 --> 02:44:54.970]  Fox News locally had articles and video of it in my film, The Takeover.
[02:44:55.630 --> 02:45:00.231]  Before 9-1-1, folks, this is the control grid, and George, you're a former city councilman.
[02:45:00.251 --> 02:45:11.175]  When you can't get into the city council building, when you've got to go to some other facility, when they end citizens' communications effectively, I mean, it's tyranny, and it's happening everywhere.
[02:45:11.235 --> 02:45:12.215]  Go ahead and finish your comments.
[02:45:12.295 --> 02:45:15.656]  Yeah, and the point is, is that most of these council members
[02:45:17.304 --> 02:45:20.908]  This information is so much bigger than what they realize.
[02:45:21.248 --> 02:45:23.411]  They're just being carried along.
[02:45:23.431 --> 02:45:27.615]  Yeah, the city manager just says, this is the new thing for you.
[02:45:27.655 --> 02:45:30.338]  It's not the city manager initiating it.
[02:45:30.638 --> 02:45:32.460]  There are people who are higher up.
[02:45:33.001 --> 02:45:35.784]  Our present city manager is a good person.
[02:45:36.164 --> 02:45:38.165]  But I don't think she sees the whole deal.
[02:45:38.485 --> 02:45:43.707]  And standing up to the momentum is a very difficult thing to do.
[02:45:43.767 --> 02:45:48.128]  So you couldn't even get in the building and there's a cop in his black combat boots saying, move along, slave.
[02:45:48.228 --> 02:45:57.791]  So what I am encouraging every person, whether you're in Austin, Texas, or in Schenectady, or in Portland, is go to your local officials.
[02:45:58.271 --> 02:45:59.732]  Take them Alex's tapes.
[02:45:59.872 --> 02:46:01.393]  Take them my books and tapes.
[02:46:01.853 --> 02:46:02.533]  Talk to them.
[02:46:03.138 --> 02:46:12.105]  And just give them the information and realize it's going to be very, very difficult for them to understand this and get it.
[02:46:12.145 --> 02:46:15.848]  They need to be knee-deep in your books and my books and my videos.
[02:46:15.888 --> 02:46:17.229]  In fact, we never gave this out this hour.
[02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.990]  We talked about it.
[02:46:18.410 --> 02:46:25.376]  If you want his new CD, book on tape, or the books, go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free right now.
[02:46:25.396 --> 02:46:25.456]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:33.742]  And it's 9-1-1, The Great Illusion, 888-253-3139.
[02:46:34.043 --> 02:46:43.870]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:46:44.891 --> 02:46:49.835]  You know, the City Councilwoman came and said she was afraid of the Patriot Act and concerned they were going to pass something.
[02:46:50.075 --> 02:46:51.216]  That never happened, George.
[02:46:51.456 --> 02:46:54.999]  Yeah, and Jackie, I think, got swallowed up by the others.
[02:46:55.359 --> 02:46:56.680]  And we're going to get back with others.
[02:46:57.535 --> 02:46:57.916]  That's great.
[02:47:13.234 --> 02:47:21.826]  I would encourage you to educate yourself and then to go down in prayer and realize, again, this is not just a political or an economic battle.
[02:47:22.127 --> 02:47:23.909]  This is a time of spiritual choice.
[02:47:28.763 --> 02:47:31.444]  And each person has to stand up right now.
[02:47:31.844 --> 02:47:32.144]  They do.
[02:47:32.184 --> 02:47:40.507]  You've got to stand up right now and you have got to confront these people with the facts, in love, and let them know what's happening.
[02:47:40.567 --> 02:47:43.288]  It's got to be done now, folks.
[02:47:43.348 --> 02:47:47.009]  This is life or death situation.
[02:47:47.749 --> 02:47:50.130]  Let's take one call from Boston.
[02:47:50.290 --> 02:47:51.350]  Is it Kevin from Boston?
[02:47:51.390 --> 02:47:51.650]  Go ahead.
[02:47:51.690 --> 02:47:52.390]  You're our last caller.
[02:47:52.430 --> 02:47:52.730]  Quickly.
[02:47:53.951 --> 02:47:54.891]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:47:55.031 --> 02:47:56.712]  Hi, George.
[02:47:56.752 --> 02:47:57.412]  Two quick things.
[02:47:58.188 --> 02:48:07.791]  When you talk about them potentially having a nuclear chemical biological attack coming, I'm thinking of how thin their control is paper thin right now.
[02:48:08.131 --> 02:48:11.992]  The CFR is setting it up to clamp down cities, to put us in sports stadiums.
[02:48:12.112 --> 02:48:21.094]  It's admitted Bush has a new six plus billion dollar forced injection thing called BioShield to build level four bioweapons labs everywhere.
[02:48:21.294 --> 02:48:23.455]  It is hell on earth they're building.
[02:48:24.296 --> 02:48:31.120]  People are turning, and I picture Boris Yeltsin standing up, and the people rallying against the Soviet Union as they expose their weakness.
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:34.321]  And these desperate acts expose that they're vulnerable.
[02:48:34.941 --> 02:48:42.445]  And I'm wondering, does he have any knowledge of, like I read in Skolniks, had suggested that there was flag officers organizing some resistance.
[02:48:42.545 --> 02:48:44.126]  No, I don't buy that.
[02:48:44.446 --> 02:48:46.807]  Real quick, George, you've got 30 seconds.
[02:48:47.108 --> 02:48:49.289]  Well, the fact is that we don't know.
[02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:53.731]  What we do know is that something is coming, and we have to prepare ourselves.
[02:48:54.346 --> 02:48:56.768]  Yeah, the globalists are saying bigger attacks are coming.
[02:48:56.788 --> 02:48:57.948]  We're going to take all your rights.
[02:48:58.309 --> 02:48:59.510]  Foreign troops are going to help.
[02:48:59.770 --> 02:49:02.512]  We've hired a $200 billion mercenary army to help.
[02:49:03.132 --> 02:49:04.233]  Time Corps is here to help.
[02:49:04.693 --> 02:49:07.975]  Wake up, they're putting cameras in my neighborhood with microphones.
[02:49:08.355 --> 02:49:09.556]  That's in the mainstream news.
[02:49:10.037 --> 02:49:11.478]  George, I want to thank you for coming on.
[02:49:11.518 --> 02:49:12.218]  God bless you, brother.
[02:49:12.238 --> 02:49:14.059]  Thank you very much.
[02:49:14.179 --> 02:49:15.460]  George, can we have you back up soon?
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:16.341]  Oh, I'd love to.
[02:49:16.901 --> 02:49:17.662]  You are wonderful.
[02:49:17.702 --> 02:49:19.244]  Great bouncing ideas back and forth.
[02:49:19.284 --> 02:49:21.607]  You see very clearly, my friend, and dive deeply.
[02:49:21.967 --> 02:49:22.628]  God bless you all.
[02:49:22.688 --> 02:49:23.649]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:23.689 --> 02:49:24.890]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 central.
[02:49:28.114 --> 02:49:31.758]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[02:49:31.898 --> 02:49:36.283]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:49:36.483 --> 02:49:37.084]  The Aeronizer.
