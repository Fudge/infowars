[00:00:03.863 --> 00:00:07.085]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.688 --> 00:00:15.328]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:17.069]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.950]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.371]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:21.972]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:26.334]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.854 --> 00:00:30.936]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:44.207]  We are now following the exact model used by dictators to intensify their hold on populations.
[00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:52.131]  Whether it was Bill Clinton or George W. Bush, the agenda of the New World Order is spiraling out of control.
[00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:56.833]  Years ago, I read a Pensacola News Journal article
[00:00:57.848 --> 00:01:04.975]  That is on Infowars.com in one of our press releases about how during a red alert you won't be able to leave your house and have any rights.
[00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:07.237]  We have a link to it in that story.
[00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:14.584]  The Marines took over the school and announced, this is martial law.
[00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:18.108]  Bill Clinton wants you to know what martial law is about.
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.461]  Well, now I have this article.
[00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:22.121]  Fox News.
[00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:28.024]  Young Marines teach kids discipline, integrity, and it turns out it's an anti-drug, anti-gun program.
[00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:32.707]  And they teach the kids if they join the globalists, they get to have guns.
[00:01:33.127 --> 00:01:34.408]  If not, it's over.
[00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:37.210]  It's all part of pure evil.
[00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.592]  Ridge favors national ID system for livestock.
[00:01:42.617 --> 00:01:44.057]  Now, Clinton floated this.
[00:01:44.677 --> 00:01:52.199]  They want to have another layer of bureaucracy there harassing you at your farm and ranch, your sheep, your goats, your horses, your pigs, your cows.
[00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:56.160]  A new layer of taxation on your livestock.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.320]  Regulation, manipulation.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.501]  To be able to raise animals, there will be all these rules.
[00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:06.102]  You'll be harassed by game warden, environmentalist, control freaks.
[00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:08.082]  I hope you enjoy it, folks.
[00:02:08.182 --> 00:02:08.663]  I really do.
[00:02:08.703 --> 00:02:10.523]  I know you're going to go along with it, so enjoy it.
[00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:20.925]  And Ridge said that last year, I've got him on tape on C-SPAN, to have a job, you'll have to have a special national ID card, a federal security clearance to work anywhere.
[00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:26.548]  Everything will be like Trusted Traveler in the terrorism databases.
[00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.431]  A local police can put you in the database.
[00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:31.531]  No conviction needed.
[00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:33.773]  You're pro-Second Amendment, pro-Constitution.
[00:02:33.793 --> 00:02:35.734]  You're already being listed by the ADL.
[00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:38.816]  They fill the federal and state databases.
[00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:41.958]  Just a wonderful new system.
[00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.200]  Worse than 1984.
[00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:51.476]  And they'll tell you it's pro-America and run lots of sappy TV shows with flag waving and the rest of it.
[00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:54.176]  And so it'll be okay.
[00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:58.278]  You'll feel real good while you're totally enslaved.
[00:02:58.318 --> 00:03:02.040]  Just big government exploding in size, and it's conservative.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.601]  I'm going to turn my guns in.
[00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:07.402]  Oh, I got news of conservative states gun-grabbing all across the country.
[00:03:07.723 --> 00:03:08.983]  Wait until you hear about this.
[00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:17.888]  Again, conservatism now is a byword for big government, no freedom, condoms, abortion, everything.
[00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.509]  They are ultra-liberals.
[00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.770]  They are winning the war.
[00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:26.776]  Destroying America because the liberals learned how to dress up like conservatives.
[00:03:27.097 --> 00:03:27.977]  It happened, folks.
[00:03:28.057 --> 00:03:28.477]  It happened.
[00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:31.739]  Now can we wake up the mindless general public?
[00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:33.060]  Well, I think we can.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.082]  I think the general public is smart, but they're not focused on real issues.
[00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:37.282]  U.S.
[00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:42.045]  reported the push for Iraqi government with Pentagon prevailing.
[00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:50.150]  And they are appointing the members of the Ba'ath Party, the torture lords and others trained in the U.S.
[00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.390]  in the 80s.
[00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:52.622]  In the 70s.
[00:03:53.602 --> 00:03:55.003]  All CIA, of course.
[00:03:55.023 --> 00:03:57.005]  They are another easy victory for them.
[00:03:57.025 --> 00:03:58.165]  They're going to be running things.
[00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:01.308]  And we'll get to that for you as well.
[00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.549]  Cash quarantine in China.
[00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:04.970]  War on SARS.
[00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:07.412]  They have public service announcements here now.
[00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:09.413]  Demonizing how cash is dirty.
[00:04:10.014 --> 00:04:12.575]  Yeah, that's moving us towards banning cash.
[00:04:12.615 --> 00:04:13.336]  That's right.
[00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:15.437]  Very close to that.
[00:04:15.497 --> 00:04:16.118]  You didn't know that?
[00:04:16.578 --> 00:04:17.579]  Oh yeah, they'll just have another...
[00:04:18.564 --> 00:04:21.205]  Economic kick-off and say this is the new system and you'll accept.
[00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:25.827]  They're already getting used to getting rid of the green back with the new colored money that's already starting to come out.
[00:04:27.228 --> 00:04:29.489]  Don't replace all your green money in the next few years.
[00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:33.631]  Well, they're going to let you have the good old-fashioned one that was green.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.341]  And we'll get into that.
[00:04:36.742 --> 00:04:38.603]  Also, they're killing people's dogs and cats.
[00:04:38.643 --> 00:04:42.106]  They say it doesn't spread SARS, but it's always a good idea in China.
[00:04:42.126 --> 00:04:45.990]  Of course, last year in one province, they ordered all dogs to be turned in.
[00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.971]  They're not allowed to have those.
[00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:49.033]  They say it's a waste of your time.
[00:04:49.053 --> 00:04:52.376]  It's all part of the state running things, like we're going to have here.
[00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:53.797]  But that's okay.
[00:04:53.817 --> 00:04:54.438]  That's freedom.
[00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.701]  Border Patrol agents shot in Laredo, but hey, so what?
[00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:03.100]  Veterans try to go down and protect the Border Patrol.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.202]  The Border Patrol arrests them and roughs them up.
[00:05:07.643 --> 00:05:09.163]  Don't you dare try to protect us.
[00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:09.924]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.504 --> 00:05:14.386]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:20.049]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:21.970]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events.
[00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:30.718]  And perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:05:30.838 --> 00:05:35.203]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:05:35.383 --> 00:05:43.711]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:50.395]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:54.957]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:55.177 --> 00:05:59.399]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.082]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:04.102 --> 00:06:04.342]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:10.931 --> 00:06:18.313]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:18.574 --> 00:06:23.315]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:23.535 --> 00:06:29.177]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:29.437 --> 00:06:30.158]  We're good to go.
[00:06:45.808 --> 00:06:46.289]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:09.838 --> 00:07:10.298]  We're good to go.
[00:07:10.318 --> 00:07:10.498]  I think?
[00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.710]  We're good to go.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.882]  Listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley Sunday evenings at 6 p.m.
[00:07:55.922 --> 00:07:57.322]  Central, 7 Eastern.
[00:07:57.542 --> 00:08:06.285]  Call 1-888-826-4448 to learn more or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[00:08:06.465 --> 00:08:09.066]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:13.220]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.641]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.323 --> 00:08:27.784]  This broadcast is all about freedom.
[00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:34.426]  We have been trained to be a domesticated population of control freaks.
[00:08:34.846 --> 00:08:36.927]  Our rulers are control freaks.
[00:08:37.547 --> 00:08:38.247]  Sadistic freaks.
[00:08:39.764 --> 00:08:40.224]  Thank you.
[00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:01.480]  Subconsciously think they're part of the power system.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:10.829]  I hear hosts all the time call for banning cell phones and cars, call for banning SUVs, call for regulating and taxing and controlling.
[00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:17.215]  And don't worry, you're going to get the control you want, and it isn't going to make you safer.
[00:09:17.275 --> 00:09:22.200]  It's going to make your life a living hell, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:22.721]  In fact...
[00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:31.315]  California has banned almost all the guns, and their crime rate has exploded over 11% in the last year.
[00:09:32.756 --> 00:09:35.058]  I was reading the AP report yesterday.
[00:09:35.098 --> 00:09:38.221]  A caller said their news in California says 35%.
[00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:39.982]  And why is that?
[00:09:40.022 --> 00:09:42.284]  They take the guns in England, their crime rate explodes.
[00:09:42.304 --> 00:09:45.146]  They take the guns in Australia, the crime rate explodes.
[00:09:45.166 --> 00:09:45.727]  Well, let me see.
[00:09:45.927 --> 00:09:51.011]  They totally ban guns in New York City, and they have the highest crime rate to this day...
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:10:05.230]  In the country, and you go to Chicago with a virtual gun ban, you go to Boston with a virtual gun ban, you go to places where you can't go and buy a gun and have one in your house, legally and lawfully, you've got a lot of crime.
[00:10:06.911 --> 00:10:08.693]  Now that's a fact, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:08.713 --> 00:10:11.355]  That cannot be ignored or avoided.
[00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:17.920]  And we know that when a state has a low threshold of gun control...
[00:10:18.689 --> 00:10:25.614]  Where you have more liberty and some semblance of a Second Amendment left, you have the lowest crime rates.
[00:10:26.655 --> 00:10:38.223]  Because even a crackhead or junkie won't invade your home when you're there because they know there's a 50-50 chance they're going to get killed.
[00:10:39.474 --> 00:10:50.886]  There's a 100% chance you come in my house when I'm here and you start trying to steal stuff or hurt somebody, I'll shoot you until the gun is unloaded.
[00:10:51.446 --> 00:10:55.851]  Because I'm a human being that hasn't been domesticated.
[00:10:55.871 --> 00:10:58.614]  Now why am I off on that rant?
[00:10:58.674 --> 00:11:00.616]  There is a bunch of conservative...
[00:11:01.434 --> 00:11:02.594]  Gun grabbing going on.
[00:11:02.634 --> 00:11:04.035]  Again, it's not really conservative.
[00:11:04.055 --> 00:11:05.195]  Bush isn't conservative.
[00:11:05.515 --> 00:11:06.916]  His cabinet isn't conservative.
[00:11:06.956 --> 00:11:11.057]  They are the most socialistic creatures ever seen in U.S.
[00:11:11.077 --> 00:11:11.537]  history.
[00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:14.218]  But they're just puppets carrying out the agenda.
[00:11:14.538 --> 00:11:17.939]  If you had Al Gore in office, things would be worse than it was under Clinton.
[00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:24.021]  And whoever's in office next, it's going to be worse than under George W. Because they're puppets.
[00:11:24.061 --> 00:11:24.861]  They're front men.
[00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:27.602]  And I think everybody deep down knows that.
[00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:29.964]  By the way, I'm sick of gimmicks.
[00:11:30.365 --> 00:11:45.149]  Bush is going to land on an aircraft carrier and announce that we're winning the war, but that the terrorists are going to hit us, and we've got to give all our rights up, and the war's never going to end, and the news is all, look how brave he is to land on an aircraft carrier.
[00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:48.550]  No one's ever seen honor and courage like this.
[00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:54.032]  You know, he was in the Air National Guard, himself a great veteran.
[00:11:54.532 --> 00:11:59.634]  Yeah, who went for about two weeks and then never showed up again and wasn't port-martialed.
[00:11:59.674 --> 00:12:00.754]  You or I would have been.
[00:12:00.774 --> 00:12:06.356]  I mean, how many news reporters have taken off and landed on aircraft carrier decks?
[00:12:06.396 --> 00:12:09.057]  But no, they say, there's a bunch of articles here.
[00:12:09.137 --> 00:12:10.698]  Bush has just got so much courage.
[00:12:10.758 --> 00:12:11.598]  It's just incredible.
[00:12:13.118 --> 00:12:20.901]  By the way, I was treated last night to this sappy Discovery Channel program about the POWs.
[00:12:21.593 --> 00:12:23.434]  And the Delta Force, a daring raid.
[00:12:23.474 --> 00:12:25.675]  Turns out the Iraqis had pulled out that morning.
[00:12:26.195 --> 00:12:26.835]  They knew it.
[00:12:27.355 --> 00:12:33.038]  The doctors had done surgery and taken care of the people and gotten word out to get the people saved.
[00:12:33.078 --> 00:12:35.299]  We're glad the POWs were saved.
[00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:38.080]  But it turns out that...
[00:12:39.051 --> 00:12:39.592]  We're good to go.
[00:12:53.979 --> 00:12:58.480]  But that was on one show, and the average person still has this idea of the lies.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.880]  I'm just tired of lies, folks.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.261]  Of course Saddam is a bucket of trash.
[00:13:04.801 --> 00:13:06.041]  Of course he's evil.
[00:13:06.582 --> 00:13:09.322]  The CIA hired him, folks, in 58 as a hitman.
[00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:10.902]  Told him to invade Kuwait.
[00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:12.683]  I mean, yeah, he's a bad guy, folks.
[00:13:12.903 --> 00:13:14.503]  So I'm not sad for Saddam.
[00:13:15.703 --> 00:13:23.145]  I am sad for the Iraqi people that are being mowed down in large piles by the hundreds if they dare to protest and one child throws a rock
[00:13:23.994 --> 00:13:25.575]  I am sad for the U.S.
[00:13:25.615 --> 00:13:29.317]  citizen, the young college girl, unarmed, run over by a bulldozer.
[00:13:29.337 --> 00:13:34.720]  He then savagely backed back over her in the giant armored army bulldozer.
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:42.684]  I am sad for the AP and Reuters cameramen that are being shot by Israeli snipers in the head as they wear vests that say press.
[00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:48.140]  I am sad for the police officers killed by their own SWAT team members.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:55.125]  I am sad for the people being shook down by corrupt cops and having guns planted on them.
[00:13:55.665 --> 00:14:01.210]  I am sad, ladies and gentlemen, for the people being abused by government worldwide
[00:14:02.245 --> 00:14:08.590]  I'm upset by Communist China and forced abortion and forced infanticide of living out-of-the-womb babies.
[00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:15.194]  I'm upset that our government gives them permanent most favored trading status and brings them into the world trade organization.
[00:14:15.714 --> 00:14:25.301]  I'm upset that most of our factories are shutting down and are never coming back and that home foreclosures nationwide are at record levels since the Great Depression.
[00:14:25.962 --> 00:14:30.665]  I'm upset by the fact that we told you NAFTA and GATT would destroy our economy.
[00:14:32.359 --> 00:14:35.200]  And now it's doing that, and what does the government do?
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:42.821]  They say they're going to expand it, despite the fact that in major polls, 80-plus percent of Americans are against NAFTA and GATT and know it's bad.
[00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:52.783]  Despite the fact that most Americans, and now up into the 90th percentile, want the borders shut and illegals deported, including 80-plus percent of Hispanics want that.
[00:14:53.503 --> 00:14:55.804]  The media has tried to make it a racial issue, but they can't.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.581]  Despite that, the border's more open than ever.
[00:14:59.221 --> 00:15:00.482]  I'm tired of it.
[00:15:01.022 --> 00:15:01.923]  I'm angry.
[00:15:02.283 --> 00:15:04.344]  You're not going to get my guns, government.
[00:15:06.745 --> 00:15:14.609]  I mean, Bush tripled the size of the BATF, he's reinstating the gun ban from Clinton, and he's got new laws that dwarf that.
[00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:22.113]  And you sickos out there, you weak-minded neocons, you know who you are, the Bush-Cheney sticker on your car.
[00:15:22.753 --> 00:15:25.855]  You might as well have an Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin sticker.
[00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.053]  That's about as freedom-loving as we're talking about here.
[00:15:32.355 --> 00:15:37.800]  I mean, how is gun-grabbing, open borders, signing on to UN treaties, conservative?
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.462]  Would you please explain that to me?
[00:15:39.482 --> 00:15:43.286]  Alright, I'm going to try to not shout for three hours today.
[00:15:44.747 --> 00:15:46.649]  I have gotten a little bit out of control, folks.
[00:15:47.049 --> 00:15:47.430]  I, uh...
[00:15:49.033 --> 00:15:50.493]  My whole staff is freaking out, though.
[00:15:50.793 --> 00:15:51.834]  We read this news.
[00:15:51.894 --> 00:15:52.834]  We look at it every day.
[00:15:53.154 --> 00:15:54.655]  Let me just read some of the headlines.
[00:15:55.015 --> 00:15:57.215]  Young Marines teach kids discipline and integrity.
[00:15:58.436 --> 00:16:02.057]  You read into the article, you find out it's anti-gun brainwashing.
[00:16:02.497 --> 00:16:02.897]  Of course.
[00:16:04.337 --> 00:16:10.299]  Just like you hear Bush signs Amber Alert, and then it goes, oh, more CPS funding so the government can grab people's kids.
[00:16:10.839 --> 00:16:14.000]  You're five times more likely to be abused in their custody.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:14.920]  But so what?
[00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.031]  Ridge favors national ID system for livestock.
[00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:20.331]  Do you know how bad this is?
[00:16:21.052 --> 00:16:27.093]  A whole layer of government bureaucracy in your life harassing you, taxing you.
[00:16:27.213 --> 00:16:39.077]  Oh, yes, a whole new bureaucracy knowing everything you've got, your cats, your dogs will be pigs, sheep, goats, cows, horses, a whole layer of tax.
[00:16:39.517 --> 00:16:44.959]  You'll have a registration fee every year on your animal, but it's to keep the homeland and the food supply safe.
[00:16:45.911 --> 00:16:46.652]  We're good to go.
[00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:47.632]  We're good to go.
[00:16:47.653 --> 00:16:48.373]  We're good to go.
[00:17:09.554 --> 00:17:14.102]  Layers of security to have a job as a taxi driver, a truck driver, any and everything.
[00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:22.556]  Agriculture, farming, ranching, literal federal agents dropping by, fining and feeing and taxing.
[00:17:23.098 --> 00:17:33.382]  Maybe you haven't worked in an industry where the FCC drops by and harasses your stations, or fines and fees you, or you can't get a ferment to expand.
[00:17:33.622 --> 00:17:36.283]  Well, you're all going to enjoy it now with farming and ranching.
[00:17:36.444 --> 00:17:37.504]  You thought it was hard?
[00:17:37.664 --> 00:17:38.885]  You're barely hanging on?
[00:17:39.025 --> 00:17:45.387]  They're going to walk over to your fingers and stomp on them as they register all your guns and go, This is conservative!
[00:17:45.467 --> 00:17:46.288]  Ha ha ha!
[00:17:46.668 --> 00:17:47.908]  I hope you enjoy it.
[00:17:47.948 --> 00:17:50.369]  You'll go, Yes, sir, Mr. Rich!
[00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:51.790]  It is conservative!
[00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.531]  Expand the Department of Education!
[00:17:54.751 --> 00:18:00.255]  Create giant new federal bureaucracies to harass farmers and ranchers and every other person that works!
[00:18:00.735 --> 00:18:01.535]  Thank you!
[00:18:03.296 --> 00:18:05.397]  Folks, you realize that I got an article right here.
[00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:08.579]  They're now going to put face scanners in the... It's happening.
[00:18:08.899 --> 00:18:10.540]  The Defense Department is running it.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.361]  Oh, yes!
[00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:12.421]  The Defense Department.
[00:18:12.622 --> 00:18:13.102]  The Army.
[00:18:13.122 --> 00:18:14.503]  They're the ones that are going to watch you now.
[00:18:14.523 --> 00:18:15.063]  Haven't you heard?
[00:18:15.103 --> 00:18:16.664]  It's all part of the new free country.
[00:18:17.624 --> 00:18:19.465]  Saddam had troops watching his people.
[00:18:19.505 --> 00:18:20.326]  Why not here?
[00:18:22.324 --> 00:18:22.945]  We're good to go.
[00:18:45.087 --> 00:18:45.688]  We're good to go.
[00:19:04.745 --> 00:19:06.547]  Even if you have an account, you'll have to do it.
[00:19:06.567 --> 00:19:09.270]  And simultaneously, the grocery stores are putting it in.
[00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:15.797]  And simultaneously, the schools, thousands of school districts, if your child wants a school lunch, they have to thumb scan to get food.
[00:19:16.397 --> 00:19:17.438]  No cash allowed.
[00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:25.787]  Are you starting to figure out the type of hellish prison they are building for you and your family?
[00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:29.458]  I got chill bumps all over me, goosebumps.
[00:19:29.818 --> 00:19:31.178]  The hair is on the back of my neck.
[00:19:31.718 --> 00:19:33.619]  I'm like a dog ready to chomp.
[00:19:33.859 --> 00:19:34.739]  I'm not growling.
[00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.240]  My hair is up, folks.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:50.804]  If you don't have the hair up on the back of your neck ready for a fight, if you don't have the adrenaline, the hormones being delivered to your body, letting you know you're under attack, you're dead already.
[00:19:52.569 --> 00:19:54.951]  Government thinks that you are its property.
[00:19:55.031 --> 00:20:00.975]  It's setting it up to let you know you are literal cattle in the chute to these people.
[00:20:02.896 --> 00:20:03.937]  Wake up!
[00:20:04.457 --> 00:20:05.538]  Wake up!
[00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:07.079]  Wake up!
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:07.920]  Wake up!
[00:20:10.265 --> 00:20:12.046]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:20:12.226 --> 00:20:17.869]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:20:18.189 --> 00:20:19.050]  Probably never, right?
[00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.372]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.

[00:21:09.484 --> 00:21:11.146]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:11.446 --> 00:21:17.153]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:17.433 --> 00:21:22.577]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:22.918 --> 00:21:32.225]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.853]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.

[00:21:47.157 --> 00:21:53.144]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:22:24.175 --> 00:22:24.415]  The book,
[00:22:51.397 --> 00:22:56.058]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[00:22:56.298 --> 00:23:00.219]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.

[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.841]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:23:14.261 --> 00:23:18.742]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:23:19.202 --> 00:23:24.084]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:23:24.424 --> 00:23:26.205]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:23:26.265 --> 00:23:27.285]  can barely be read.
[00:23:27.585 --> 00:23:28.565]  It has faded that much.
[00:23:28.906 --> 00:23:32.807]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.

[00:24:03.729 --> 00:24:04.169]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:24:23.888 --> 00:24:29.150]  You know, there's a few things that really illustrate what I'm talking about here on this show, why I'm so angry.
[00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.531]  Maybe you haven't heard, but it's been on television.
[00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:37.433]  I know schools right here in Texas, parents right here in Texas that have called in on the show about it.
[00:24:37.493 --> 00:24:38.233]  It's been in the news.
[00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:42.440]  Dodgeball has been banned almost nationwide.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.000]  I remember our favorite game.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:51.902]  In fact, the girls, the kids that weren't that big, the runts, everybody loved dodgeball.
[00:24:51.982 --> 00:24:54.182]  I mean, everybody would hooray to play it.
[00:24:54.902 --> 00:24:55.783]  Everyone loved it.
[00:24:57.363 --> 00:24:59.623]  And, you know, if somebody didn't like it, that's the way sports are.
[00:24:59.663 --> 00:25:00.844]  That's the way P.E.
[00:25:01.264 --> 00:25:05.145]  should be when you're 6 years old, 7-year-old, 8-year-old, 10, 12.
[00:25:05.485 --> 00:25:06.485]  You should play it when you're about 10 or 12.
[00:25:07.974 --> 00:25:08.594]  They banned it.
[00:25:08.894 --> 00:25:17.737]  And then I read a report about a month ago where they arrested kids, two or three of them, criminal charges of assault, because they would meet before school.
[00:25:17.757 --> 00:25:21.538]  I remember doing stuff like this, but we would wrestle.
[00:25:22.618 --> 00:25:30.060]  We would wrestle and knock our teeth out and break our noses, and the coaches would come around and go, you guys, watch it, you're going to get hurt.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.140]  Do that on the mats with your headgear.
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.541]  Get in here, I'm giving you a SWAT.
[00:25:35.915 --> 00:25:42.543]  You know, they'd take you to the nurse and fix your lip, and then you'd get a pop for wrestling without headgear.
[00:25:42.563 --> 00:25:43.745]  But the point is...
[00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:46.120]  Absolutely.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.340]  I'll sign them over to probation.
[00:26:13.593 --> 00:26:14.654]  You've probably heard they're making...
[00:26:38.323 --> 00:26:39.444]  Musical chairs.
[00:26:39.484 --> 00:26:40.845]  You can't play musical chairs.
[00:26:40.925 --> 00:26:47.109]  Now, there have been arrests made for musical chairs, but there are arrests for secretly playing dodgeball or tag.
[00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.609]  I forgot.
[00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:49.850]  Tag, too, has been banned.
[00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:53.252]  And this is the insanity of it.
[00:26:53.873 --> 00:27:03.459]  But there's cops in black ski masks marching up and down the halls in lockdowns, and they do drills where they hand guns at the kids and scream at them and have them load on buses, and 10-year-old girls cry.
[00:27:03.499 --> 00:27:05.480]  I have video of this in Road to Tyranny.
[00:27:06.215 --> 00:27:07.616]  This is all part of the new America.
[00:27:07.656 --> 00:27:09.336]  Marines in Pensacola, remember?
[00:27:09.876 --> 00:27:12.958]  Pensacola News Journal came in, screamed, this is martial law.
[00:27:13.258 --> 00:27:15.719]  The president wants you to know what martial law is all about.
[00:27:16.659 --> 00:27:17.259]  Well, here it is.
[00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:18.940]  Banned on campus.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.440]  Boys talking to girls.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.681]  World Net Daily.
[00:27:22.221 --> 00:27:25.842]  Elementary students protest restriction after showing public signs of affection.
[00:27:26.322 --> 00:27:27.723]  Sixth grade girls protest.
[00:27:28.203 --> 00:27:30.124]  Photo, Herald, and News newspaper.
[00:27:30.879 --> 00:27:36.401]  And it shows dozens of young sixth grade girls with signs saying, allow us to talk to boys.
[00:27:38.062 --> 00:27:44.504]  Smiling, a pat on the shoulder could lead to criminal charges.
[00:27:45.424 --> 00:27:46.865]  See, everything's criminal now.
[00:27:47.525 --> 00:27:52.467]  And here in Austin, if you're like the class, three times they set up many courts in the schools.
[00:27:53.098 --> 00:27:56.061]  They charge you with a criminal act, and your parents are charged.
[00:27:56.081 --> 00:28:00.245]  The Houston Chronicle's reported, if you don't finish your homework, the parents are now charged.
[00:28:00.385 --> 00:28:01.186]  This is mainstream news.
[00:28:01.206 --> 00:28:01.806]  You've heard about it.
[00:28:02.407 --> 00:28:02.767]  You have it.
[00:28:02.787 --> 00:28:03.648]  You better investigate.
[00:28:04.969 --> 00:28:08.452]  Pop into a search engine, parents charged if children don't finish homework.
[00:28:09.113 --> 00:28:11.235]  And hundreds of articles around the country will pop up.
[00:28:11.635 --> 00:28:12.216]  It's happening.
[00:28:12.256 --> 00:28:13.517]  It's a federal model.
[00:28:14.177 --> 00:28:16.800]  Again, the Defense Department
[00:28:17.685 --> 00:28:27.011]  He's putting in, paying for, not just systems and helicopters that look through your walls, with a crisp image using high-tech radar, not thermal, folks.
[00:28:27.631 --> 00:28:30.213]  This is crisp, this radar.
[00:28:31.294 --> 00:28:33.355]  Not just that, this ground-penetrating radar.
[00:28:34.645 --> 00:28:41.572]  Now they're giving them face scanner systems for the courthouses.
[00:28:42.032 --> 00:28:45.816]  So when you walk in, you're all scanned and put into their database.
[00:28:45.936 --> 00:28:58.087]  I mean, folks, and I read on Monday where from Oregon to Texas, the police are being given thumb scanners by, again, the federal government, the Defense Department.
[00:29:01.289 --> 00:29:08.112]  The Defense Department, remember, they told us the Total Information Awareness Network, Pentagon, to track all consumer purchases.
[00:29:08.352 --> 00:29:10.953]  Type that into a search engine, you'll get hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[00:29:11.313 --> 00:29:11.993]  It's everywhere.
[00:29:12.573 --> 00:29:19.456]  A country where the Pentagon watches your every move, where face-scanning cameras are everywhere, where the police wear black ski masks and black uniforms.
[00:29:20.327 --> 00:29:24.868]  Where if you yell back at a police dog that barks at you, you get jail time.
[00:29:25.328 --> 00:29:36.610]  A country where you're arrested if you're caught playing dodgeball, where you draw a picture of a gun or write the word gun in an essay, arrests are now being made, not just suspensions.
[00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.471]  Thought crime.
[00:29:39.291 --> 00:29:40.711]  Domestication.
[00:29:41.131 --> 00:29:43.532]  Total enslavement.
[00:29:45.372 --> 00:29:45.752]  Nathan.
[00:29:47.629 --> 00:29:49.110]  And we'll go to Boston.
[00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:54.492]  If we go to folks in Iowa, we'll go to Boston with Lucinda and many other callers.
[00:29:54.513 --> 00:29:54.873]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:55.233 --> 00:29:58.815]  Defending the Republic!
[00:30:00.555 --> 00:30:01.476]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.936 --> 00:30:03.577]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.457 --> 00:30:07.159]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.966 --> 00:30:17.893]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:30:18.133 --> 00:30:20.376]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:30:20.576 --> 00:30:21.057]  We provide... ...4438.
[00:30:21.677 --> 00:30:23.639]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:30:36.158 --> 00:30:38.060]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.423]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:45.527 --> 00:30:50.051]  I really don't think people realize how serious Homeland Security is.
[00:30:50.111 --> 00:30:53.634]  It's taken over hundreds of federal agencies.
[00:30:53.754 --> 00:30:56.477]  No, it's not 22 agencies.
[00:30:56.497 --> 00:30:59.640]  22 of the large agencies that have subgroupings
[00:31:00.524 --> 00:31:25.739]  The number, frankly, in the thousands of different projects and agencies, but let's just say, conservatively, hundreds of agencies, about 80% of the federal government, hundreds of thousands of federal employees, most of your state employees are federally mandated and controlled, so it goes into the millions that are working for the government and Homeland Security at that level.
[00:31:27.293 --> 00:31:44.081]  And Gal Leiter Ridge, our Homeland Security, Fatherland Security gracious leader, with his new powers of secret arrest and secret execution in Patriot Act 1 and 2, Ridge favors national ID system for livestock.
[00:31:45.555 --> 00:31:48.537]  Now, of course, you're livestock, too, so you've got your national ID card.
[00:31:48.877 --> 00:31:58.063]  Your driver's license in 42 states, 42 have it now, have the face scan, the thumb scan, and it's hooked in when you get your grocery store card or thumb scan to get your bank account.
[00:31:58.103 --> 00:32:00.104]  It's all being set up for you and your family.
[00:32:01.425 --> 00:32:09.930]  Ridge favors a national ID system for livestock, and this is out of the Sacramento Bee Washington Bureau.
[00:32:11.846 --> 00:32:21.875]  The Bush administration's Homeland Security Czar on Monday endorsed an ambitious concept for nationwide identification of all commercial livestock.
[00:32:22.656 --> 00:32:33.385]  Now, Lord Ridge, of course, also has called for, quote, putting troops on the streets.
[00:32:34.126 --> 00:32:35.227]  We've aired that clip here.
[00:32:35.247 --> 00:32:36.248]  He said it on Fox News.
[00:32:37.343 --> 00:32:42.526]  We want, quote, troops searching and seizing, running checkpoints, engaging in law enforcement.
[00:32:42.726 --> 00:32:45.128]  And, of course, they have the training that we're all the enemy.
[00:32:45.728 --> 00:32:53.232]  Armies fight enemies, but it's support the troop time, so support them seeking and destroying us, I guess.
[00:32:54.813 --> 00:33:00.997]  And it says some of these thoughts are certainly preliminary in nature, but given the economic significance...
[00:33:02.012 --> 00:33:09.033]  Of the livestock industry, it seems to us, it would be a very good initiative to undertake, said Tom Ridge, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:33:09.073 --> 00:33:09.333]  Yeah.
[00:33:10.013 --> 00:33:11.334]  And they've had the British over here.
[00:33:11.354 --> 00:33:13.774]  There was a Dallas Morning News article two, three years ago.
[00:33:13.794 --> 00:33:15.674]  Remember the foot-and-mouth outbreak in England?
[00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:22.656]  They wanted to bring for a drill the British Army to Texas.
[00:33:24.496 --> 00:33:29.797]  And they wanted to, quote, have the British Army do a drill with their heavy-moving equipment
[00:33:30.783 --> 00:33:33.284]  A drill of piling up dead livestock.
[00:33:33.524 --> 00:33:35.244]  And the tanks, it said, hadn't been cleaned.
[00:33:35.264 --> 00:33:40.626]  They were covered with blood and guts from the millions of dead cows they'd pushed into giant burning pits.
[00:33:41.226 --> 00:33:44.807]  They were going to have those infected tanks come over here in bulldozers.
[00:33:45.327 --> 00:33:56.350]  This was in the Dallas Morning News until the Texas Agriculture Department literally flipped out and said no because of outcry by listeners of these shows, not what the department was first for it.
[00:33:57.597 --> 00:34:05.802]  And we have a foot-in-mouth section somewhere buried in Infowars.com, Sky Television, Sunday Express, all the big news stuff in England.
[00:34:06.583 --> 00:34:10.145]  The British government actually released foot-in-mouth.
[00:34:11.947 --> 00:34:24.735]  In fact, two months before the outbreak, they had to admit they had contacted people, the agriculture departments in the counties, and said, get pyres ready, get lots of wood ready to burn piles of dead animals alive.
[00:34:25.382 --> 00:34:25.962]  They said, why?
[00:34:25.982 --> 00:34:27.263]  And they said, oh, well, you'll see.
[00:34:27.744 --> 00:34:32.887]  And then they admitted the foot and mouth got released from Porton Down Bioweapons Lab.
[00:34:32.927 --> 00:34:36.369]  They said by accident someone released it or someone stole it.
[00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:42.313]  By the way, that's a level four bioweapons lab that has stuff that will kill specific races of people.
[00:34:42.673 --> 00:34:43.934]  Wipe out all whites.
[00:34:44.054 --> 00:34:45.255]  Wipe out all blacks.
[00:34:45.615 --> 00:34:47.396]  Thought I'd mention that we've got a lab.
[00:34:47.436 --> 00:34:48.577]  Let's buy their story.
[00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:51.456]  Frankly, worse if it's an accident.
[00:34:52.277 --> 00:34:54.518]  You know, it's just government doing that to get a crisis going.
[00:34:54.558 --> 00:34:55.158]  We understand.
[00:34:55.178 --> 00:34:56.059]  That's how you operate.
[00:34:56.099 --> 00:35:03.644]  But are you really just release stuff from there and it suddenly shows up in dozens of places simultaneously in a giant outbreak?
[00:35:03.884 --> 00:35:04.544]  Oh, sure.
[00:35:05.325 --> 00:35:08.126]  But it is admitted quietly and calmly.
[00:35:08.146 --> 00:35:18.833]  Of course, it's now been quietly and calmly admitted in about 100 papers over in England and Europe that MI6 and MI5 and British, German intelligence and others carry out most of the terror attacks all over Europe.
[00:35:20.211 --> 00:35:27.256]  But Army Intelligence carries out a lot of the bombings in England itself, and the Klan groups here are founded by the Feds, and it goes on and on.
[00:35:28.316 --> 00:35:35.701]  Then we have a giant MI5, MI6 British terror section where they admit they blow up everything and blame it on political enemies.
[00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:36.782]  It's a great system.
[00:35:37.422 --> 00:35:41.845]  You know, if you want to frame somebody, you blow something up and blame it on them, and then you get to pose as the savior.
[00:35:42.525 --> 00:35:45.227]  We have them admitting this and releasing foot and mouth.
[00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:51.394]  Like I tell my webmaster at Prison Planet, maybe you can dig around in some of the old InfoWars site.
[00:35:52.555 --> 00:35:57.319]  We have a foot-in-mouth archive in some of the older front pages that are deep in the site.
[00:35:57.939 --> 00:36:04.705]  We ought to bring that foot-in-mouth archive back with those articles where the British government calmly admits they released foot-in-mouth.
[00:36:05.125 --> 00:36:07.788]  So, then they sent foot-in-mouth experts to Minnesota...
[00:36:08.368 --> 00:36:15.654]  In about 30 states, last time I checked and passed it, where there's one foot-in-mouth case, they can kill most of your cows nationwide.
[00:36:15.854 --> 00:36:16.755]  They don't have to have it.
[00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:18.176]  They just kill all your cows and sheep.
[00:36:19.757 --> 00:36:22.940]  And then after, in England, I predicted, and this did happen...
[00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:27.414]  The environmental minister said, we're not going to let you restock cows and sheep.
[00:36:27.694 --> 00:36:29.435]  We've decided they're bad for the environment.
[00:36:29.455 --> 00:36:37.762]  They cause flatulence that hurts the ozone layer, and by walking on the grass, they cause runoff that contaminates the stream.
[00:36:38.062 --> 00:36:42.005]  So we'll buy your land from you and make it to a government nature preserve.
[00:36:42.346 --> 00:36:45.728]  And now most of the farms and ranches in England are shutting down.
[00:36:45.788 --> 00:36:47.930]  I know they don't have ranches, but that's what they are, folks.
[00:36:49.331 --> 00:36:50.372]  I just call them farms.
[00:36:51.606 --> 00:36:52.847]  So I'm ranting and raving.
[00:36:52.867 --> 00:36:57.130]  Yes, a plan to get you into compact cities where you can be properly enslaved.
[00:36:58.371 --> 00:36:59.853]  And so now you know what it means.
[00:37:00.033 --> 00:37:03.996]  Ridge favors national ID system for live stock.
[00:37:05.877 --> 00:37:10.961]  The Bush administration says eventually something is going to be mandated.
[00:37:12.003 --> 00:37:15.466]  Said Bob Frost, a Placer County EMA rancher.
[00:37:15.506 --> 00:37:20.289]  There is a movement in the past year that has exceeded all the movement in the past five years combined.
[00:37:20.769 --> 00:37:22.230]  Frost is president of the U.S.
[00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:23.551]  Animal Health Association.
[00:37:24.132 --> 00:37:25.252]  Oh, see, I love this.
[00:37:25.272 --> 00:37:30.316]  You'll see some show on PBS about, we need to take all the water and reduce it.
[00:37:30.336 --> 00:37:31.217]  There's no water.
[00:37:31.237 --> 00:37:37.641]  And then it goes, you know, Billy Bob is the chairman of the water district and stands to gain.
[00:37:37.921 --> 00:37:38.702]  But this guy...
[00:37:40.066 --> 00:37:42.487]  And it says, Frost is president of the U.S.
[00:37:42.567 --> 00:37:47.849]  Animal Health Association, which has been intimately involved with animal identification planning.
[00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:58.732]  Proponents speak of the gate-to-plate system tagging individual swine, cattle, and dairy cows from their birth to their ultimate culinary destination.
[00:38:01.513 --> 00:38:02.254]  And it goes on.
[00:38:02.574 --> 00:38:04.655]  You know, this is going to be a registration.
[00:38:04.675 --> 00:38:05.775]  You like registering your car?
[00:38:06.576 --> 00:38:17.840]  And you've got to register your bicycle in these cesspool cities for these bureaucrats that claim they're always bankrupt, won't fill the potholes until you take a giant tax increase while they're buying themselves lavish everything?
[00:38:19.501 --> 00:38:21.862]  You like being conned and ripped off, don't you?
[00:38:21.922 --> 00:38:23.443]  I'm sorry I'm being really mean lately.
[00:38:23.523 --> 00:38:24.843]  I just am tired of it, folks.
[00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:31.806]  And now I saw Ridge a year and a half ago, right after 9-1-1, on this Homeland Security meeting, before they even got it passed.
[00:38:33.169 --> 00:38:38.152]  And he said, they're going to tax you, they're going to trace you to have a job, any type of job.
[00:38:38.172 --> 00:38:40.073]  You're going to have a federal security card.
[00:38:40.113 --> 00:38:41.894]  They'll decide what type of job you can have.
[00:38:42.275 --> 00:38:43.235]  Bad credit score?
[00:38:44.376 --> 00:38:45.657]  Can't work in telecommunications?
[00:38:46.097 --> 00:38:47.158]  Can't work with computers?
[00:38:48.158 --> 00:38:49.179]  Even if you're self-employed?
[00:38:49.719 --> 00:38:53.061]  Can't drive a bus or a car or even your personal car?
[00:38:53.121 --> 00:38:53.782]  No taxis?
[00:38:54.537 --> 00:38:59.018]  Restaurants, 7-Elevens, oh, the farmers and ranchers, man.
[00:38:59.499 --> 00:39:05.901]  It's going to be just like Europe, where you've got inspectors harassing you, shutting you down, telling you what to do with your animals.
[00:39:05.921 --> 00:39:10.962]  You're going to have a control freak, animal rights activist that people the federal government.
[00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:11.983]  See, that's the secret.
[00:39:12.003 --> 00:39:16.564]  They want the communistic people working there, and they have a conservative head that does all this.
[00:39:16.804 --> 00:39:17.944]  The conservatives buy it.
[00:39:18.224 --> 00:39:22.826]  Well, if Bush wants me to register my animals and pay an extra registration fee...
[00:39:23.707 --> 00:39:26.368]  I guess I'll do it for the homeland, you fools.
[00:39:26.828 --> 00:39:31.429]  Wait till that little satanic hippie is on your property.
[00:39:32.389 --> 00:39:34.610]  You're going to remember I warned you.
[00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.070]  I feel so sorry for you.
[00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:36.910]  I really am.
[00:39:37.471 --> 00:39:42.132]  I'm like somebody that's warned a bad child over and over again to listen to what I'm saying.
[00:39:42.532 --> 00:39:43.752]  You need a spanking.
[00:39:44.352 --> 00:39:50.434]  The problem is the globalists are spanking you, but they're doing it so incrementally you don't even know you're boiling alive.
[00:39:52.754 --> 00:39:53.775]  It goes on and on.
[00:39:55.175 --> 00:40:00.378]  It says in California alone, roughly 1 million head of cattle, 2.3 million head of swine were slaughtered in 1999.
[00:40:00.418 --> 00:40:07.501]  That same year, California dairy farms held 1.4 million dairy cows while the state claims a sheep and lamb inventory of 800,000 head.
[00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:14.504]  And if you don't think the feds won't release a little foot and mouth to get a hysteria going...
[00:40:15.422 --> 00:40:28.744]  And to shut down and to take over the family farm, if it wasn't for cows, if it wasn't for sheep, none of us, none of us who have been in farming and ranching for hundreds of years, none of our families could still own land.
[00:40:29.605 --> 00:40:35.166]  And you've got to throw some deer hunting or hog hunting, wild hog hunting into that to pay the property tax.
[00:40:37.866 --> 00:40:42.027]  I mean, after it's all said and done with our land we've had since 1830 in East Texas,
[00:40:43.431 --> 00:40:47.694]  And every time somebody gets sick or old or has a problem or dies, you've got to sell some of the land.
[00:40:47.714 --> 00:40:51.476]  So it's gone from like tens of thousands of acres down to about half of that.
[00:40:54.298 --> 00:40:56.019]  There won't be any land in another generation.
[00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:57.440]  And you won't have any land either.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:58.520]  Okay?
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.581]  I want you to understand that.
[00:41:00.742 --> 00:41:01.742]  This is the new America.
[00:41:01.782 --> 00:41:04.864]  The cesspool, communist America for the bankers.
[00:41:05.705 --> 00:41:09.527]  The big bankers learned how to socialize things and suck it all into their coffers.
[00:41:10.288 --> 00:41:12.169]  Socialism for you, fascism for them.
[00:41:13.846 --> 00:41:14.506]  And I'm angry.
[00:41:14.646 --> 00:41:15.606]  I mean, I'm so angry.
[00:41:16.487 --> 00:41:18.687]  I'm trying to articulate the picture of what's happening.
[00:41:19.327 --> 00:41:26.829]  We have to spend all the money from deer hunting, all the money from the cows, everything, and maybe there's $5,000 profit at the end of it.
[00:41:27.449 --> 00:41:28.929]  And then you pay income tax on that.
[00:41:30.189 --> 00:41:38.111]  And then everybody that still works the land there, my family, my cousins, my uncle, my grandmother, and others, still work the land and do some things there.
[00:41:39.051 --> 00:41:42.772]  They have to go and have jobs as schoolteachers.
[00:41:44.102 --> 00:41:46.023]  I mean, I got family out there.
[00:41:46.583 --> 00:41:47.884]  Work at the power plant.
[00:41:47.924 --> 00:41:50.585]  Work at the prison in the winter.
[00:41:50.645 --> 00:41:52.446]  Then feed your cows in the morning and night.
[00:41:53.106 --> 00:42:09.433]  They're working six, seven days a week, 14 hours a day for this cesspool government of degenerate drug dealers who are shipping heroin and cocaine and are turning all our children into chic ghetto men.
[00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:10.827]  Preachers.
[00:42:10.887 --> 00:42:11.768]  I mean, that's what it is now.
[00:42:11.828 --> 00:42:16.171]  Your children are all being trained how to act like gangsters, behave like gangsters.
[00:42:16.532 --> 00:42:20.575]  It's been stylized so people stay in the ghetto, so they don't climb out of it.
[00:42:20.835 --> 00:42:27.900]  The police have been trained that anyone who engages in any of the dress is to be attacked, is basically an enemy.
[00:42:28.221 --> 00:42:32.064]  You let your kids put on the uniform that the police have been trained is the enemy.
[00:42:33.064 --> 00:42:34.886]  So they can grab your kids and put them in prison.
[00:42:38.048 --> 00:42:39.029]  It's a sickening
[00:42:40.038 --> 00:42:48.385]  Scientifically crafted, society-destroying, warmock, battleship of evil, crushing our freedoms.
[00:42:49.025 --> 00:42:53.569]  No matter what color you are or where you're from, throw your television away.
[00:42:53.689 --> 00:42:55.570]  Stop letting your kids watch MTV.
[00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:58.733]  Don't say you can't watch MTV because it's too cool and grown up.
[00:42:59.033 --> 00:43:05.038]  Say you can't watch it because it's an enemy operation system to break you down, to train you to not have morals.
[00:43:05.758 --> 00:43:07.860]  Folks, if you don't have standards and morals...
[00:43:09.469 --> 00:43:12.852]  And, oh, what's the operative word?
[00:43:13.312 --> 00:43:26.462]  If you don't have a code of conduct, a belief system, an honor system, a conscience, if you don't have that ideal, then you become a hateful creature.
[00:43:27.963 --> 00:43:29.745]  And you become one of their slaves.
[00:43:29.765 --> 00:43:31.206]  You only care about money.
[00:43:31.966 --> 00:43:34.148]  You only care about animalistic ideas.
[00:43:34.168 --> 00:43:35.329]  You only care about sex.
[00:43:36.167 --> 00:43:38.548]  You don't care if something bad is happening to your neighbor.
[00:43:38.828 --> 00:43:40.469]  You're not willing to fight and stand up.
[00:43:40.649 --> 00:43:42.330]  People operate out of greed and fear.
[00:43:44.151 --> 00:43:46.112]  In the past, they operated out of principle.
[00:43:46.232 --> 00:43:46.893]  That's the word.
[00:43:47.193 --> 00:43:48.574]  You've got to have principles.
[00:43:50.775 --> 00:44:02.601]  You know, your kid thinks Sumner Redstone and the death metal and the rap is so cool and that culture of drugs and violence and wild sex is so cool.
[00:44:03.419 --> 00:44:14.046]  Take your child downtown when they're about 12 and let them see what it really looks like before they've been indoctrinated into it being cool.
[00:44:14.566 --> 00:44:31.637]  Show them the swarming mass of drug addicts and then show them the yuppies and show them how it all is down there together in your downtown cess district and show them how it's destroying your society and show them how it's meant to eat your brain.
[00:44:33.317 --> 00:44:34.858]  And turn you into a mindless idiot.
[00:44:34.878 --> 00:44:37.140]  All right, I'm going to try to be calmer.
[00:44:38.401 --> 00:44:45.726]  Folks, when the government announces they're going to start taxing all your cows and your pigs and your sheep and going to have a regulator harassing you, that's the plan.
[00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:46.607]  It makes me very angry.
[00:44:46.627 --> 00:44:47.047]  I'm sorry.
[00:44:47.787 --> 00:44:58.335]  When I hear the Marines are now going to be in all the schools training kids that guns are illegal and the homeland's good and, by the way, we've got uniforms for you if you join Operation Tips or Wave or Save.
[00:44:59.474 --> 00:45:04.015]  When I hear the Pentagon's watching everything citizens do and they go out to protest in D.C.
[00:45:04.075 --> 00:45:10.517]  and Denver and Dallas and the Army's on the street videotaping a peace protest, I don't know, it makes my blood boil.
[00:45:12.998 --> 00:45:23.542]  When the FBI announces they got planes in the air that look through our walls with Defense Department technology and they're giving it to the police and they put video of it on tech TV and here's someone inside their house.
[00:45:23.802 --> 00:45:25.562]  The helicopter sees right through the walls.
[00:45:26.262 --> 00:45:27.903]  Look at this man at his dinner table.
[00:45:28.493 --> 00:45:29.414]  That makes me mad.
[00:45:29.494 --> 00:45:34.116]  Hey, folks, freedom isn't helicopters looking through your walls, in case you didn't know.
[00:45:38.119 --> 00:45:43.302]  I know that we've got Osinda and Nathan and Bob and others holding.
[00:45:44.103 --> 00:45:47.425]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:45:47.645 --> 00:45:50.987]  I normally go to callers earlier in the show.
[00:45:51.587 --> 00:45:53.148]  This week, I've been really angry.
[00:45:54.869 --> 00:45:58.011]  And I have been going to calls early in the first hour, but we'll get to them in the next segment.
[00:45:59.904 --> 00:46:00.764]  Just the news here.
[00:46:00.805 --> 00:46:07.848]  Now to go in your courthouse, the Defense Department dropped by and put in a face scanner to make sure you're not a, quote, criminal.
[00:46:09.488 --> 00:46:14.971]  And the Defense Department's funding the banks to put in thumb scanners, even if you have a bank account.
[00:46:15.842 --> 00:46:17.383]  And the kids can't get their lunches.
[00:46:17.763 --> 00:46:19.944]  No cash allowed now in thousands of districts.
[00:46:20.445 --> 00:46:21.585]  You know what that means?
[00:46:22.025 --> 00:46:23.186]  No cash allowed.
[00:46:23.586 --> 00:46:24.567]  Training them for this.
[00:46:25.187 --> 00:46:29.950]  Everything you purchase going into a federal database, they'll know what you drink and eat and do.
[00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:31.171]  That's fine.
[00:46:31.491 --> 00:46:32.531]  I have nothing to hide.
[00:46:32.771 --> 00:46:34.032]  Well, the government sure does.
[00:46:34.232 --> 00:46:36.594]  They're making all their activities secret right now.
[00:46:38.294 --> 00:46:38.895]  Right now.
[00:46:40.796 --> 00:46:41.736]  Folks, have you read 1984?
[00:46:41.916 --> 00:46:42.577]  This is worse.
[00:46:45.342 --> 00:46:48.544]  You're like, well, they're not grabbing us and putting us in camps and killing us yet.
[00:46:48.904 --> 00:46:50.886]  Oh yeah, they're putting it down in law now.
[00:46:51.987 --> 00:46:54.268]  You're like, well, if it's the law, I'll enforce it.
[00:46:54.929 --> 00:46:58.691]  Folks, if a law violates the Bill of Rights, it's null and void.
[00:46:58.731 --> 00:46:59.952]  Marbury v. Madison.
[00:47:00.953 --> 00:47:07.918]  Now they had laws that, I use this example a lot because it's so good, but they had laws that black people weren't human beings.
[00:47:08.758 --> 00:47:12.801]  They could have a ring in their nose and be drug around by a rope.
[00:47:14.679 --> 00:47:19.680]  They had laws in Europe that 90% of the white people were slaves.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:27.221]  And if the local duke or earl or vice duke wanted your wife, was prima noctu, they got to drop by.
[00:47:29.402 --> 00:47:30.502]  They called it serfdom.
[00:47:30.882 --> 00:47:32.702]  You know, we've traced my family lineage.
[00:47:33.262 --> 00:47:37.303]  Some of it came from German nobility.
[00:47:37.383 --> 00:47:41.684]  Some of it came from Scottish sharecroppers, indentured servants.
[00:47:41.844 --> 00:47:43.264]  I come from slaves, folks.
[00:47:44.108 --> 00:47:48.552]  I am not going back into it.
[00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:55.417]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:47:56.037 --> 00:47:56.898]  Folks, it's bad.
[00:47:56.958 --> 00:47:57.719]  It's worse than bad.
[00:47:57.779 --> 00:47:58.539]  It's crazy.
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.382]  And I just recognize how nuts it's gotten.
[00:48:02.402 --> 00:48:05.545]  I mean, they're building a horrible system.
[00:48:07.398 --> 00:48:10.680]  They say their world rate is going to be 85%, folks.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:22.606]  After all the taxes and fees and fines and security fees to have a job, your little security job, the trusted travelers and index in your bank account, your record, you're going to have to have that to have a job?
[00:48:22.626 --> 00:48:25.488]  I mean, do you realize how bad this is?
[00:48:26.528 --> 00:48:29.770]  Are you just going to cower and let America die?
[00:48:32.131 --> 00:48:35.013]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:48:35.718 --> 00:48:36.999]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:48:37.199 --> 00:48:42.941]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:48:43.221 --> 00:48:48.483]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:48:48.764 --> 00:48:52.925]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:48:53.105 --> 00:48:56.887]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:48:57.147 --> 00:49:01.769]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:49:01.869 --> 00:49:08.112]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:49:08.152 --> 00:49:10.013]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:49:10.473 --> 00:49:12.554]  Order 911 The Road to Tyrion today.
[00:49:12.634 --> 00:49:16.916]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:49:16.996 --> 00:49:18.297]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:49:18.517 --> 00:49:24.160]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.281]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:49:26.521 --> 00:49:28.022]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:49:28.202 --> 00:49:30.283]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:49:31.278 --> 00:49:42.007]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:49:42.188 --> 00:49:49.774]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:50.054 --> 00:49:53.157]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:49:53.437 --> 00:49:59.159]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:49:59.459 --> 00:50:05.621]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:50:05.981 --> 00:50:09.862]  The Berkeley light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:50:09.922 --> 00:50:11.783]  The water level is always visible.
[00:50:11.983 --> 00:50:13.145]  We're good to go.
[00:50:29.987 --> 00:50:31.729]  Are you prepared?
[00:50:31.929 --> 00:50:34.332]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[00:50:34.553 --> 00:50:38.978]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[00:50:39.278 --> 00:50:42.742]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[00:50:42.982 --> 00:50:45.125]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[00:50:45.465 --> 00:50:49.826]  Jerry Guidetti from the ARC Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[00:50:50.066 --> 00:50:52.986]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[00:50:53.106 --> 00:51:00.188]  Call the ARC Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[00:51:00.408 --> 00:51:05.709]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[00:51:05.989 --> 00:51:10.990]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:12.310]  Jerry can help here too.
[00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.790]  The book,
[00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:17.734]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[00:51:17.954 --> 00:51:21.877]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[00:51:21.997 --> 00:51:23.939]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll free, 1-800-255-1912.
[00:51:23.959 --> 00:51:24.959]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com.
[00:51:34.113 --> 00:51:40.159]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:51:40.759 --> 00:51:43.762]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:45.263 --> 00:51:52.550]  A couple days ago, I mentioned a story we posted on InfoWars.com, and it's right there in the archives.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:52:01.183]  One of the big Chicago papers admitted that while it is true, the 1968 Gun Control Act was translated from the Nazi Gun Control Act.
[00:52:01.543 --> 00:52:02.743]  Two words were changed.
[00:52:03.043 --> 00:52:06.265]  Here's the record from the Library of Congress.
[00:52:06.285 --> 00:52:11.746]  I mean, you know, if the truth gets out of what they're setting up, this thing cannot stand.
[00:52:12.807 --> 00:52:19.109]  The whole system, the Homeland Security, the youth, the taking over the churches, the federalization of voting with the touchscreen systems...
[00:52:20.137 --> 00:52:23.359]  It is an exact tyranny pattern we're following.
[00:52:23.399 --> 00:52:27.641]  All right, Nathan, Osinda, Eric, Kevin, Ron, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:29.882]  And I haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:52:29.902 --> 00:52:31.442]  I've covered some of the important news.
[00:52:31.482 --> 00:52:36.705]  The news is so insane today that I will cover all 100 articles.
[00:52:37.265 --> 00:52:38.125]  I'm going to do it.
[00:52:38.346 --> 00:52:40.867]  I'm going to do it in the next two hours.
[00:52:41.107 --> 00:52:44.068]  And we're going to get to all your calls immediately after this break.
[00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:45.209]  Immediately.
[00:52:45.229 --> 00:52:45.929]  You've been patient.
[00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:47.630]  We'll go to your calls.
[00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:50.371]  Maybe even before this segment ends.
[00:52:50.411 --> 00:52:52.112]  But I can't help it.
[00:52:52.132 --> 00:52:58.737]  I've got to tell you, my friends, I've made eight videos, documentary films, and I've written a book, Ascent into Tyranny.
[00:52:58.757 --> 00:53:00.878]  9-1-1, Ascent into Tyranny.
[00:53:00.898 --> 00:53:02.819]  It's the book, $12, 230 pages.
[00:53:03.339 --> 00:53:05.121]  You want to find out who carried out 9-1-1.
[00:53:05.221 --> 00:53:08.983]  You want to find out who the globalist are, what their master plan is.
[00:53:09.583 --> 00:53:10.884]  You want to educate people.
[00:53:10.944 --> 00:53:11.885]  You want the facts.
[00:53:12.913 --> 00:53:15.154]  Get 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:53:15.334 --> 00:53:24.998]  And all the documents and things we mention in the book and in Source are in the prior knowledge section of 9-1-1 on prisonplanet.com and on infowars.com.
[00:53:25.358 --> 00:53:26.599]  Both great resources.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.621]  Then I made two films about September 11th and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:53:31.721 --> 00:53:32.782]  Part 1 is 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:53:32.802 --> 00:53:33.262]  144 minutes long.
[00:53:33.282 --> 00:53:33.602]  On DVD it's 170.
[00:53:33.642 --> 00:53:34.582]  Part 2, The Masters of Terror.
[00:53:41.704 --> 00:53:42.225]  We're good to go.
[00:53:42.245 --> 00:53:42.465]  I think?
[00:54:02.846 --> 00:54:07.669]  Go to infowars.com or net to order, or simply call toll-free.
[00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:13.092]  Operators are there right now, and it supports the broadcast, and you're authorized to make copies of my films.
[00:54:13.652 --> 00:54:16.314]  That's how we force multiply this information.
[00:54:16.334 --> 00:54:17.054]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:54:17.074 --> 00:54:17.375]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:54:17.395 --> 00:54:18.115]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:54:18.155 --> 00:54:19.756]  Get the films today.
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:45.905]  Again, that's 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or net or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:54:48.465 --> 00:54:49.826]  Let's go to Nathan in Iowa.
[00:54:49.866 --> 00:54:50.646]  Thanks for holding, Nathan.
[00:54:50.666 --> 00:54:51.206]  You're on the air.
[00:54:51.226 --> 00:54:52.547]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:53.027 --> 00:54:53.427]  How you doing?
[00:54:54.067 --> 00:54:54.287]  All right.
[00:54:54.767 --> 00:54:55.888]  I had two things.
[00:54:57.268 --> 00:55:00.389]  The first was I was watching my local news in Des Moines
[00:55:01.532 --> 00:55:05.134]  Last night, and they had stuff on there about tracking your child.
[00:55:06.554 --> 00:55:10.596]  And they were talking about implantable microchips and how they're tracking you through your cell phone.
[00:55:11.236 --> 00:55:16.418]  And there's a guy on there that was saying that he was promoting that it's so good to have
[00:55:16.957 --> 00:55:19.579]  You know, a microchip planted behind your kid's ear.
[00:55:19.899 --> 00:55:22.241]  Sean Hannity says every child needs a chip.
[00:55:22.321 --> 00:55:23.421]  Next is going to be the law.
[00:55:23.541 --> 00:55:25.723]  The Amber Alert has nothing to do with kids.
[00:55:25.783 --> 00:55:28.865]  It's publicly EAS, FEMA takeover system.
[00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:30.746]  We posted the photo yesterday.
[00:55:31.227 --> 00:55:34.168]  Using Amber, they're flashing report terrorist.
[00:55:34.449 --> 00:55:38.351]  This is running man where the billboards report, report.
[00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:42.394]  Folks, it's the most hellish future you can imagine.
[00:55:43.706 --> 00:55:48.089]  Yeah, it's a two-part special, and there's going to be some more about it tonight.
[00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:48.870]  What channel?
[00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:50.731]  I mean, what network?
[00:55:51.892 --> 00:55:55.175]  It's KCCI Channel 8 out of Des Moines.
[00:55:55.395 --> 00:55:57.317]  But is it a local show or an actual show?
[00:55:58.357 --> 00:55:59.438]  It's just local news.
[00:56:00.559 --> 00:56:01.800]  Will you tape it for me, sir?
[00:56:02.721 --> 00:56:03.481]  Yeah, I'll tape it for you.
[00:56:03.501 --> 00:56:07.304]  I was wondering if I could maybe go up there, because I didn't get a chance to tape it last night.
[00:56:08.325 --> 00:56:11.287]  You can call them, and they will tell you who their tape provider is.
[00:56:11.307 --> 00:56:12.508]  You don't have to pay for it.
[00:56:12.528 --> 00:56:12.748]  Stay there.
[00:56:12.768 --> 00:56:13.489]  We'll talk more about it.
[00:56:14.105 --> 00:56:16.667]  Yeah, they got the consultants that control radio and TV.
[00:56:16.687 --> 00:56:19.930]  They go around and say, everybody likes pieces on chips and kids.
[00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:20.551]  Do that.
[00:56:21.592 --> 00:56:22.333]  Are you prepared?
[00:56:22.533 --> 00:56:24.915]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[00:56:25.155 --> 00:56:29.579]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[00:56:29.879 --> 00:56:39.248]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.795 --> 00:56:47.435]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.095 --> 00:56:49.176]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:49.876 --> 00:56:50.996]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.637 --> 00:56:52.437]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.197 --> 00:56:54.078]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.098 --> 00:56:58.419]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:03.081]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:08.063 --> 00:57:12.325]  Social architects, social engineers, psychiatrists with 170 plus IQs.
[00:57:15.863 --> 00:57:17.724]  Massive computer war games.
[00:57:18.504 --> 00:57:23.025]  Testing and drilling how to brainwash you, how to dumb you down, how to get you to accept tyranny.
[00:57:23.346 --> 00:57:25.966]  They're building a giant electronic cage for you and your family.
[00:57:26.367 --> 00:57:31.548]  Imagine five years ago, I was on the air saying they're going to have a push to put chips in all the children.
[00:57:31.988 --> 00:57:35.269]  The government plan is to put chips in all the children, in everyone.
[00:57:35.289 --> 00:57:40.111]  You have to have cards to have jobs, no rights, no private property.
[00:57:40.131 --> 00:57:42.812]  Kind of hard to believe, though I was reading government documents.
[00:57:43.809 --> 00:57:43.929]  Yeah.
[00:57:43.969 --> 00:57:44.129]  Yeah.
[00:57:44.209 --> 00:57:44.410]  Yeah.
[00:58:03.493 --> 00:58:05.274]  And say, no, we're not buying any of this.
[00:58:05.875 --> 00:58:07.936]  We're not even going to debate shipping people.
[00:58:08.416 --> 00:58:11.679]  We know you're criminals who want to implant us to control us.
[00:58:12.079 --> 00:58:12.919]  Now, go ahead, sir.
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:16.021]  What else did you want to add about this disgusting broadcast?
[00:58:16.322 --> 00:58:17.442]  What exactly did this guy say?
[00:58:17.462 --> 00:58:22.986]  Because I've seen similar ones around the country, tailored locally, getting us ready for this evil.
[00:58:23.827 --> 00:58:28.190]  Well, I didn't see all of it because I was trying to scramble and find a blank tape, but I couldn't find one.
[00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:31.732]  But the part that I've seen was they were talking about how they were
[00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:36.671]  If your child has a cell phone, that they're going to track your child through their cell phone.
[00:58:36.851 --> 00:58:47.013]  Now, notice yesterday I announced, in October 2001, the government for years had said it was going to be law that all cell phones are satellite tracked off the cell towers.
[00:58:47.093 --> 00:58:50.574]  The cell phone itself is a satellite track, but triangulated off the towers it is.
[00:58:51.934 --> 00:58:54.375]  And they did this.
[00:58:54.495 --> 00:59:01.416]  But now that they're announcing that we're about to be tracking you, the government says that, oh, the police locally will watch you through the FEMA command center they built.
[00:59:02.176 --> 00:59:03.717]  Now it's, oh, it's for the children.
[00:59:03.757 --> 00:59:04.597]  See how they introduced it?
[00:59:04.637 --> 00:59:05.898]  It's for the children.
[00:59:06.438 --> 00:59:07.578]  It's for the criminals.
[00:59:08.079 --> 00:59:09.539]  It's for the minority.
[00:59:09.799 --> 00:59:11.680]  See, it's always for that other group.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.240]  Go ahead.
[00:59:13.481 --> 00:59:23.425]  Yeah, I mean, I couldn't believe it because, you know, you think that since I live in Iowa that I might be sheltered from this a little bit, but the truth of the matter is that no one is sheltered in the entire country.
[00:59:23.445 --> 00:59:24.966]  Sir, Iowa is one of the worst.
[00:59:25.706 --> 00:59:28.267]  Yeah, because... Do you have news?
[00:59:28.528 --> 00:59:30.288]  You know of News 8 in Des Moines, right?
[00:59:31.369 --> 00:59:31.569]  Yeah.
[00:59:32.071 --> 00:59:33.672]  Well, News 8's online.
[00:59:33.732 --> 00:59:34.733]  I have it on video.
[00:59:35.814 --> 00:59:38.175]  It goes, well, we've been running truck points at the airport.
[00:59:38.195 --> 00:59:39.356]  Now we're going to be on the highway.
[00:59:39.376 --> 00:59:40.517]  Ma'am, please comply.
[00:59:40.597 --> 00:59:43.819]  And it shows them searching her vehicle on the highway.
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:49.703]  And then down in Ohio, right over from you, man, they got everything there.
[00:59:50.163 --> 00:59:51.925]  The troops have taken over Dayton.
[00:59:53.105 --> 00:59:53.506]  Go ahead.
[00:59:53.546 --> 00:59:55.387]  What else were you going to say?
[00:59:55.787 --> 00:59:55.947]  Just...
[00:59:57.253 --> 00:59:57.513]  I don't know.
[00:59:57.533 --> 00:59:58.334]  I just couldn't believe it.
[00:59:58.394 --> 01:00:01.897]  But the second thing that I had was I was going to ask you when your new videotape is coming out.
[01:00:03.138 --> 01:00:04.399]  Folks cannot order it yet.
[01:00:04.459 --> 01:00:05.199]  It's not done.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.042]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement will be coming out in a few weeks.
[01:00:10.063 --> 01:00:10.323]  Okay.
[01:00:10.363 --> 01:00:11.064]  Well, that's all I had.
[01:00:11.264 --> 01:00:11.504]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:12.025]  I'll see you next time.
[01:00:12.085 --> 01:00:12.465]  All right.
[01:00:12.705 --> 01:00:13.946]  I appreciate you, sir.
[01:00:15.027 --> 01:00:15.687]  I really do.
[01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:22.473]  Yes, you cannot order Police State 3 Total Enslavement yet.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.042]  Oh, man, and this thing is encyclopedic.
[01:00:27.102 --> 01:00:28.243]  It's really going to be a powerful film.
[01:00:28.344 --> 01:00:30.425]  Osinda, you have held like a champion.
[01:00:31.146 --> 01:00:33.428]  Your call is up next when we get back from this quick break.
[01:00:33.488 --> 01:00:40.775]  And then Eric, Kevin, Ron, and others, a toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:40.795 --> 01:00:46.640]  Hey, you've got to be preemptively down at your county commissioners, your state legislature.
[01:00:47.461 --> 01:00:48.421]  Calling Washington.
[01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:55.024]  You've got to preemptively find out if any of the mutual funds you own own speculative tech stocks like Applied Digital.
[01:00:55.664 --> 01:00:57.985]  If you've got Motorola, they're involved in the biochip.
[01:00:58.145 --> 01:00:58.705]  IBM.
[01:00:59.165 --> 01:01:01.466]  IBM is a so-called good stock.
[01:01:01.486 --> 01:01:03.206]  Well, yeah, it's like buying a piece of Satan.
[01:01:03.686 --> 01:01:05.247]  You need to go ahead and dump that stock.
[01:01:05.267 --> 01:01:09.709]  You need to go ahead and boycott IBM and their human genome progress.
[01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:11.789]  That's even worse, what they're doing with that.
[01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:13.790]  By the way...
[01:01:14.722 --> 01:01:16.162]  I would add an addendum to that.
[01:01:17.043 --> 01:01:22.144]  IBM owns, or the Communist Chinese military owns, Applied Digital Solutions, their front company.
[01:01:22.884 --> 01:01:25.825]  They don't want to take the heat of being involved with this product, but they are the owners.
[01:01:25.845 --> 01:01:28.365]  You know, their financial statements, 2000, 2001.
[01:01:28.585 --> 01:01:31.046]  I think 2002 is out yet.
[01:01:31.066 --> 01:01:31.586]  I haven't read it.
[01:01:32.326 --> 01:01:38.668]  Communist Chinese plant is being built for the implantator, injector, and chip itself.
[01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:40.648]  It's all part of hell on earth.
[01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:50.634]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:01:50.894 --> 01:01:55.636]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:01:55.856 --> 01:02:01.538]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:02:01.758 --> 01:02:06.260]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:13.663]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:02:13.683 --> 01:02:18.206]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:02:18.366 --> 01:02:20.887]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:02:21.107 --> 01:02:27.810]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.371]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:52.107]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:02:52.307 --> 01:02:56.770]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:59.933]  There are no moving parts, and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[01:03:00.213 --> 01:03:04.777]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[01:03:05.097 --> 01:03:09.001]  Made of the finest materials, it has a two-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[01:03:09.241 --> 01:03:11.643]  And the Aaronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[01:03:11.923 --> 01:03:15.806]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[01:03:16.047 --> 01:03:21.251]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds, and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[01:03:21.471 --> 01:03:24.394]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[01:03:24.554 --> 01:03:26.436]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[01:03:26.656 --> 01:03:29.298]  For more information about the Aaronizer, call toll-free.
[01:03:29.538 --> 01:03:31.240]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:33.142]  The toll free number to call is 877-605-9200 That's 877-605-9200
[01:03:41.323 --> 01:03:48.150]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:49.852]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:03:50.052 --> 01:03:52.234]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:03:52.394 --> 01:03:54.496]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:03:54.757 --> 01:03:59.701]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:00.042 --> 01:04:04.066]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:04.306 --> 01:04:06.087]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:06.167 --> 01:04:16.815]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:16.975 --> 01:04:18.876]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:19.076 --> 01:04:22.919]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:04:23.039 --> 01:04:24.460]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:24.700]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:04:31.505 --> 01:04:35.086]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:04:35.366 --> 01:04:39.447]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:04:43.189 --> 01:04:45.389]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:45.409 --> 01:04:48.770]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:56.493]  The House is desperately trying to seal a bunch of 9-1-1 documents.
[01:04:59.349 --> 01:05:06.391]  And they'd better hope those documents stay sealed because, frankly, everything in the investigations is already public knowledge.
[01:05:06.631 --> 01:05:08.452]  Funding the hijackers, training them.
[01:05:09.512 --> 01:05:12.893]  Hijackers not even being on the aircraft, still being alive.
[01:05:13.913 --> 01:05:16.154]  The CIA remote controlling the aircraft.
[01:05:16.901 --> 01:05:26.724]  Oh, the Associated Press reported they were running a drill that morning of flying hijacked jet airliners into landmarks in New York and D.C., but that was just a coincidence.
[01:05:26.764 --> 01:05:29.984]  That's why NORAD just accidentally stood down.
[01:05:30.004 --> 01:05:31.765]  Ha-ha.
[01:05:32.325 --> 01:05:39.607]  I'm going to go over that, some new stuff today, a bunch of... The news is insane, but I promise we go to these calls.
[01:05:41.079 --> 01:05:43.841]  Osinda in Boston, one of our Boston listeners.
[01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:45.922]  Osinda, good to have you on board with us.
[01:05:45.962 --> 01:05:46.602]  Welcome, ma'am.
[01:05:46.983 --> 01:05:48.423]  Pleasure to speak to you again, sir.
[01:05:48.483 --> 01:05:49.204]  It's a man.
[01:05:49.224 --> 01:05:50.445]  It's Osinda?
[01:05:50.525 --> 01:05:50.845]  Okay.
[01:05:50.925 --> 01:05:52.105]  I was told it was a lady.
[01:05:52.145 --> 01:05:52.546]  Go ahead.
[01:05:52.726 --> 01:05:53.846]  How are you doing, sir?
[01:05:54.247 --> 01:05:55.688]  How do I pronounce your name so I get it right?
[01:05:56.048 --> 01:05:56.668]  Osinda.
[01:05:57.529 --> 01:05:58.149]  Osinda.
[01:05:58.209 --> 01:05:59.310]  I was told Osinda.
[01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.930]  Yeah.
[01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:01.751]  Oh, Osinda is obviously a man's name.
[01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:02.231]  Yes, sir.
[01:06:02.311 --> 01:06:03.512]  Welcome, Osinda.
[01:06:04.452 --> 01:06:04.933]  I'm fine.
[01:06:04.953 --> 01:06:05.233]  Thank you.
[01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:15.268]  I just heard over the airwaves, Boston Morgan Airport State Police are going to start carrying submachine guns.
[01:06:15.348 --> 01:06:17.009]  Which does nothing to stop anybody.
[01:06:17.209 --> 01:06:17.689]  Exactly.
[01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:20.171]  The black ski mask Nazi look is in.
[01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:20.871]  Exactly.
[01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:26.774]  And also, I was wondering, have you ever heard of the governor of here, Mitt Romney?
[01:06:27.913 --> 01:06:29.114]  I haven't read about him, yes.
[01:06:29.134 --> 01:06:29.554]  What about him?
[01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:44.121]  Well, okay, he passed a law where, because even though the registry in Massachusetts is going crazy because the new math IDs are being duplicated by college students all over, and the new ID scanners, they can't even pick them up.
[01:06:44.662 --> 01:06:52.746]  So I was at a city hall meeting the other day, and I was like, well, you know, they're coming to a point where biometrics are going to be introduced, and that's something I'm totally against.
[01:06:53.706 --> 01:06:56.788]  And they had made a comment, and they said, hey, well, what are you going to do?
[01:06:57.606 --> 01:06:59.529]  I would put it this way when you talk to them.
[01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.629]  Okay.
[01:07:12.751 --> 01:07:21.096]  In the late 60s, the army who's planning our lives here in the New World Order system, I don't mean the guy in the army down the street from me who's a patriot.
[01:07:21.136 --> 01:07:30.622]  I mean the war colleges, the computers, the futurists, the experts, the guys with the brain cases the size of basketballs who've got red glowing eyes, literally.
[01:07:31.442 --> 01:07:32.203]  These guys...
[01:07:33.693 --> 01:07:36.815]  In there said, we've got to put in a cashless system.
[01:07:36.835 --> 01:07:39.556]  We've got to do this to get taxation and control.
[01:07:39.576 --> 01:07:41.978]  The bankers print the money.
[01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:43.058]  They want control.
[01:07:43.098 --> 01:07:44.519]  It isn't about making money, folks.
[01:07:44.719 --> 01:07:46.160]  They don't care if we have a good economy.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.841]  It's about enslavement.
[01:07:48.476 --> 01:07:49.776]  It's about control.
[01:07:49.796 --> 01:07:51.437]  It's about mind control.
[01:07:51.697 --> 01:07:55.738]  And that's what these biometrics are about, is taxing the daylights out of you.
[01:07:55.778 --> 01:07:56.158]  Go ahead.
[01:07:56.518 --> 01:08:00.139]  Well, what I figured I would do, I ordered your tapes.
[01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:03.339]  And what I did, because, I mean, I just can't sleep.
[01:08:03.459 --> 01:08:04.500]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.261]  I spend probably about 15 hours a day studying, reviewing articles you put out.
[01:08:09.421 --> 01:08:10.541]  That's because you're normal.
[01:08:10.601 --> 01:08:15.602]  You're sane when you read about giant FEMA camps and execution centers that upset you.
[01:08:15.902 --> 01:08:16.242]  Oh, yeah.
[01:08:16.463 --> 01:08:17.143]  I mean, I can't sleep.
[01:08:17.163 --> 01:08:20.085]  If there would have been a couple million of you in Germany, we wouldn't have had Hitler.
[01:08:20.366 --> 01:08:20.586]  Right.
[01:08:20.986 --> 01:08:26.130]  And I mean, every time I close my eyes, I think of my daughter, and I'm right back up, you know, researching information.
[01:08:26.611 --> 01:08:34.357]  So what I did was, and I'm not sure, did you receive from any of your listeners the tape on Mindy Kleinberg from the 9-11 commissions?
[01:08:35.854 --> 01:08:37.535]  I wasn't sure if you received that yet.
[01:08:38.116 --> 01:08:41.157]  I received some of the 9-1-1 hearings, yes.
[01:08:41.378 --> 01:08:54.066]  Okay, well, what I did was I kind of improvised, and what I did was I put just her part of what she testified to about security exchange and accountability and all the stuff that she mentioned.
[01:08:54.746 --> 01:09:00.310]  Then I noticed Frank Keaton, and I remember from Roger Tierney in Oklahoma saying,
[01:09:00.771 --> 01:09:09.879]  And I was looking at how nervous everyone on the panel got when she started talking about security and exchange and who was supposed to be accountable with NORAD and why were they told to stand down.
[01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:12.841]  And I put that at the end of your tapes.
[01:09:12.901 --> 01:09:15.223]  I put Masters of Terror, then I put the end of that.
[01:09:15.683 --> 01:09:18.566]  And I've been getting out as many tapes as I can.
[01:09:19.293 --> 01:09:24.979]  And I try to get it towards Mitt Romney's office, and I don't think it will even fly.
[01:09:24.999 --> 01:09:28.823]  And my question is... At least they'll know that we know.
[01:09:28.843 --> 01:09:29.363]  Right, right.
[01:09:29.443 --> 01:09:35.890]  That's really important that they know, that we know, and more people know who did it every single day.
[01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:39.854]  You know, I've been watching HBO, and I was watching Bill Maher.
[01:09:40.928 --> 01:09:46.535]  You know, the guy's a leftist, so they allow him to do it because it still keeps you in the left-right paradigm so you don't escape.
[01:09:46.575 --> 01:09:49.819]  But they come out on that show and just admit the government did it.
[01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:50.980]  I've been blown away by it.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:51.621]  Wow.
[01:09:52.662 --> 01:09:53.403]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:53.463 --> 01:09:55.946]  See, we're the icebreakers.
[01:09:55.986 --> 01:09:58.489]  We're the guys on the front line.
[01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:00.011]  Oh, definitely.
[01:10:12.032 --> 01:10:12.773]  I definitely will, sir.
[01:10:12.833 --> 01:10:13.694]  I've got one more point.
[01:10:13.714 --> 01:10:13.794]  Okay.
[01:10:32.153 --> 01:10:33.194]  Can I say one more thing?
[01:10:33.214 --> 01:10:34.194]  Yeah, real quick, I'll send it.
[01:10:34.374 --> 01:10:40.498]  Okay, I'll tell you right now, for anyone listening in Boston, look up in the sky sometime late at night.
[01:10:41.018 --> 01:10:49.243]  Well, first look up in the sky and see the airplanes releasing those chemicals, and then late at night, I think those aircraft, those drones or whatever you're talking about,
[01:10:49.773 --> 01:10:53.174]  I think I've seen them, and I'm getting videotape on them, and I'll send them to you.
[01:10:53.294 --> 01:11:11.958]  Well, sir, the FBI said in the Midwest alone, first it was 80 nationwide, then it was 84 in the Midwest, piloted two Cedar aircraft with stuff that looks right at their walls, and they've said, Warner said it six months ago, it's already happened, they have now deployed Pentagon drones against us.
[01:11:11.978 --> 01:11:12.258]  Huh.
[01:11:12.819 --> 01:11:15.663]  And my cousin works out at the airport.
[01:11:16.104 --> 01:11:17.867]  He's in the Army, and they're merging.
[01:11:17.927 --> 01:11:24.037]  He said the APD with the Army, they got helicopters, drones, everything, and they are surveilling Austin.
[01:11:24.898 --> 01:11:26.000]  I got a visit Monday.
[01:11:27.023 --> 01:11:28.124]  You didn't hear me talk about that?
[01:11:28.364 --> 01:11:29.024]  Yeah, I heard you, sir.
[01:11:29.324 --> 01:11:30.125]  I got it on video.
[01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:31.766]  In fact, I'm going to go live on TV today.
[01:11:31.786 --> 01:11:33.127]  I remember to get that tape and show that.
[01:11:33.427 --> 01:11:34.307]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[01:11:34.327 --> 01:11:34.848]  Thank you, sir.
[01:11:35.288 --> 01:11:36.308]  Appreciate it, Osinde.
[01:11:36.629 --> 01:11:37.749]  Send me that tape.
[01:11:37.829 --> 01:11:41.431]  Just that clip and how they act and what they do when she does it.
[01:11:41.471 --> 01:11:42.252]  I need it quickly.
[01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:42.992]  Please.
[01:11:44.593 --> 01:11:46.094]  Oh, a quick program note.
[01:11:46.114 --> 01:11:50.036]  Then I'll go to Eric and Kevin and Ron and many others that are holding.
[01:11:52.518 --> 01:11:56.660]  I made a comment on the Saturday show I do with Stat Miller.
[01:11:57.711 --> 01:12:05.094]  I made a comment last weekend that after every time there's a terror event, the listenership peaks.
[01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:05.835]  It spikes.
[01:12:06.535 --> 01:12:07.996]  Well, obviously, all news.
[01:12:08.016 --> 01:12:09.376]  Newspaper sales go up.
[01:12:09.796 --> 01:12:11.777]  Radio listenership goes up for news talk.
[01:12:13.718 --> 01:12:14.519]  That always happens.
[01:12:15.659 --> 01:12:20.881]  And I made the comment that right after the so-called Iraq War ended, that listenership dropped.
[01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:21.742]  And then...
[01:12:22.611 --> 01:12:28.013]  You know, that gets picked up, and another host says it, another host says it, and basically it ends up we don't have any listeners.
[01:12:28.733 --> 01:12:29.494]  That's ridiculous.
[01:12:30.174 --> 01:12:36.836]  If you look at a three-year graph, and last time I looked at this, it was like a 300-and-something percent increase.
[01:12:37.917 --> 01:12:45.159]  In one year alone, we had a 200% increase, and Ted still runs, the owner still runs an ad from like two years ago where he talks about a 200% increase in one year.
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:47.840]  Just take the Internet.
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:48.481]  How do we know?
[01:12:48.521 --> 01:12:49.461]  We've gone from having...
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:54.761]  500 people logged on to one of our four Internet screens.
[01:12:54.881 --> 01:12:55.881]  We have four different screens.
[01:12:56.761 --> 01:13:09.664]  400 logged on in any one second, and the JavaScript shows that 400 is more like 2,000, to having, during my show, 1,200, 1,500 people logged on any one time.
[01:13:11.684 --> 01:13:14.205]  So, again, it's like this.
[01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:15.465]  It's like Mount Everest.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.541]  It just continues to go straight up.
[01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.663]  It's like the stock market in the mid-90s and the late 90s.
[01:13:22.203 --> 01:13:24.424]  It's going straight up on a big graph.
[01:13:25.064 --> 01:13:30.347]  But it's like during the war, we hit the top of Mount Everest for the new spike.
[01:13:30.788 --> 01:13:36.711]  And then the war came to a, quote, good conclusion, and we took three steps off the peak.
[01:13:37.471 --> 01:13:38.332]  That's what I was saying.
[01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:42.074]  I'm saying that there's spikes in listenership.
[01:13:42.114 --> 01:13:43.254]  You know, like on the day of 9-1-1,
[01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:49.353]  Our Internet servers basically crashed because we hadn't gotten more bandwidth allotments.
[01:13:49.713 --> 01:13:51.794]  Now we can handle a level that big and more.
[01:13:52.955 --> 01:13:58.498]  So, you know, there can be any type of event, a mass shooting, God forbid.
[01:13:58.858 --> 01:14:00.079]  You know, you see a spike.
[01:14:00.299 --> 01:14:03.381]  That's what we're talking about is spikes.
[01:14:06.122 --> 01:14:11.025]  And then I guess, folks, that some people aren't sophisticated enough to understand that when I...
[01:14:13.217 --> 01:14:13.697]  We're good to go.
[01:14:41.533 --> 01:14:43.034]  It's got to be over 400 affiliates.
[01:14:43.174 --> 01:14:45.496]  I mean, that is exciting.
[01:14:46.977 --> 01:14:55.322]  With several of the show hosts, myself, Gary Brownfield, and others, with hundreds of affiliates each, that is amazing.
[01:14:56.443 --> 01:15:01.987]  And we love our little 1,000-watt AM transmitters in the towns and cities out there.
[01:15:02.547 --> 01:15:04.969]  We're now getting 100,000 and 50,000-watt FMs and 50,000-watt AMs turning us on.
[01:15:12.117 --> 01:15:13.557]  I've done conservatively now.
[01:15:15.018 --> 01:15:15.598]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:15:19.419 --> 01:15:21.060]  It's in the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.161]  I've done well over 800 interviews since 9-1-1.
[01:15:26.741 --> 01:15:30.302]  And I've had thousands of calls that agreed with me.
[01:15:30.402 --> 01:15:32.043]  Conservative liberal shows didn't matter.
[01:15:32.363 --> 01:15:33.963]  And hundreds of calls that disagreed.
[01:15:34.703 --> 01:15:35.804]  I mean, I've probably had, I don't know.
[01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:38.605]  I could do a show, say on KOA, for two hours.
[01:15:39.545 --> 01:15:40.125]  They can take
[01:15:41.219 --> 01:15:41.680]  30 calls.
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.501]  One guy calls in and disagrees.
[01:15:43.802 --> 01:15:46.824]  I've done shows on KFI, KOA, whatever.
[01:15:49.887 --> 01:15:50.888]  What's the big one in St.
[01:15:50.948 --> 01:15:51.328]  Louis?
[01:15:52.169 --> 01:15:54.331]  And then there's another big AM, 50,000 Water.
[01:15:54.431 --> 01:15:59.215]  And I've done the Bilbo Shearer Show like five, ten times.
[01:15:59.255 --> 01:15:59.695]  I don't know.
[01:15:59.896 --> 01:16:01.317]  What's the name of that?
[01:16:02.718 --> 01:16:03.499]  WLW.
[01:16:03.699 --> 01:16:05.681]  I've done his show like five times in a row.
[01:16:06.827 --> 01:16:09.808]  And we take 20, 30 calls and no one disagrees.
[01:16:10.188 --> 01:16:13.729]  New York, Chicago, Tampa, Florida, they're calling in.
[01:16:13.849 --> 01:16:19.471]  Everybody agrees that the government blew up the buildings, carried out 9-1-1, that we're in enslavement.
[01:16:19.871 --> 01:16:21.092]  What does that say?
[01:16:21.552 --> 01:16:25.253]  I've done a poll from the most conservative show to Pacifica Radio.
[01:16:25.553 --> 01:16:28.474]  I've been on all of it, from Ken Hamblin to you name it.
[01:16:28.974 --> 01:16:30.315]  No one calls in to disagree.
[01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:33.311]  On most of the shows.
[01:16:33.391 --> 01:16:34.852]  On some, you take 20 calls.
[01:16:35.232 --> 01:16:37.193]  One guy calls in and says, I'm going to kill you.
[01:16:37.214 --> 01:16:38.655]  You know, that's usually what we hear.
[01:16:39.175 --> 01:16:39.875]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:41.557]  Stay with me.

[01:18:30.368 --> 01:18:32.790]  Hi, Jack Browner with Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[01:18:45.367 --> 01:18:46.671]  Remember that ad from October of 2000?
[01:18:46.711 --> 01:18:49.619]  The NASDAQ was down 22% for the year?
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.404]  Well, it's since gone down another 40%.
[01:18:51.484 --> 01:18:53.711]  Folks, where will it bottom out?
[01:18:54.306 --> 01:18:54.746]  We're good to go.
[01:18:54.766 --> 01:18:54.926]  I think?
[01:19:19.003 --> 01:19:19.744]  We're good to go.
[01:19:49.821 --> 01:19:50.201]  We're good.
[01:20:07.902 --> 01:20:10.563]  Dual time display and adjustable sleep timers.
[01:20:10.963 --> 01:20:18.606]  Included accessories, the ANT60 portable shortwave antenna, AC adapter, stereo earbuds, and a soft-sided carrying case.

[01:20:24.269 --> 01:20:24.469]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:20:24.489 --> 01:20:24.729]  Call today.
[01:20:50.623 --> 01:21:03.167]  I mean, I know that every few weeks I get on the air, sometimes every week, and say, hey, I've done 750, I've done 800 interviews, hardly anybody disagrees with me, the listenership's exploded.
[01:21:03.187 --> 01:21:11.329]  I don't know, it's more than 300% if you look at those graphs, because they've got the graphs on the servers just for the Internet going back over the years.
[01:21:11.389 --> 01:21:17.491]  I know we're growing even faster with AM and FM listeners and shortwave listeners and satellite listeners.
[01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:23.498]  That's not Alex Jones going, Hey, I've got a big radio show, man.
[01:21:23.858 --> 01:21:25.699]  I'm saying we're reaching people.
[01:21:25.799 --> 01:21:27.640]  The message is connecting.
[01:21:28.641 --> 01:21:32.343]  But the people that disagree with our view, they're actually the minority.
[01:21:32.975 --> 01:21:36.077]  And they tend to run in little packs together, and they'll laugh at us.
[01:21:36.457 --> 01:21:38.878]  You mean the government did something corrupt once?
[01:21:39.058 --> 01:21:39.579]  Ha ha!
[01:21:40.019 --> 01:21:40.939]  How ridiculous!
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.521]  Hey, Martha, he believes in a new world order.
[01:21:43.881 --> 01:21:50.404]  You hold up five news articles from that week that say, world government, new world order, and they go, okay, there is one, but it's good.
[01:21:51.745 --> 01:21:52.185]  You know what?
[01:21:52.205 --> 01:21:53.306]  We're going to stand up against this.
[01:21:53.346 --> 01:21:54.687]  We're going to win this fight, folks.
[01:21:54.767 --> 01:21:59.229]  I've never seen such a renaissance and such a wake-up as I'm seeing now.
[01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:02.311]  So when I hear other hosts saying that's not the case...
[01:22:03.167 --> 01:22:04.368]  They need to get the facts.
[01:22:04.568 --> 01:22:04.988]  All right.
[01:22:05.729 --> 01:22:07.170]  Let's talk to Eric in Texas.
[01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:08.151]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:22:08.231 --> 01:22:08.831]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:22:09.211 --> 01:22:09.692]  Hi, Alex.
[01:22:11.012 --> 01:22:13.654]  Hey, I fully agree with you on your last statement there.
[01:22:13.694 --> 01:22:17.837]  I think that this is the dawning of the end of the New World Order.
[01:22:17.857 --> 01:22:23.441]  I feel like this May 1st is seeing the light come up over the horizon.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:24.921]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:22:24.961 --> 01:22:33.808]  What do you think of the announcement that they're going to tax and trace everybody's farm animals now and you'll have to have special federal clearance to even be a farmer or rancher?
[01:22:34.148 --> 01:22:34.989]  Ridge said that.
[01:22:35.049 --> 01:22:49.320]  How many times have I said that I saw that fat gorilla say that and say they were going to take over all the industries and, yes, put troops in the factories, they've said that too, and now he's up there saying it in a press conference.
[01:22:50.141 --> 01:22:52.263]  Eric, do people realize how bad that is?
[01:22:53.644 --> 01:22:57.726]  Well, they better before the farm animals wake up before them and protest.
[01:22:58.666 --> 01:22:59.146]  You know what I mean?
[01:22:59.386 --> 01:23:01.147]  Well, yeah, they see us as cattle.
[01:23:01.167 --> 01:23:03.248]  You notice they've got to ID the cattle now.
[01:23:03.568 --> 01:23:04.708]  We're already being ID'd.
[01:23:04.728 --> 01:23:06.869]  We already got the little tag in our ear.
[01:23:07.909 --> 01:23:11.631]  Well, I have a few other points I wanted to hit on here.
[01:23:11.651 --> 01:23:19.774]  I was wondering if I may take this opportunity to see if we can get any signatures on the site.
[01:23:21.801 --> 01:23:24.364]  That I talked to you before about, if you want to go ahead and announce it.
[01:23:24.704 --> 01:23:25.825]  What site is that, Eric?
[01:23:25.845 --> 01:23:29.208]  You've got a site, signatures, what, a petition?
[01:23:29.989 --> 01:23:33.212]  Yeah, it lists over about 300 grievances.
[01:23:33.753 --> 01:23:34.554]  Oh, yeah, I read that.
[01:23:34.574 --> 01:23:35.395]  You sent that to me.
[01:23:35.675 --> 01:23:36.956]  Yeah, a lot of good grievances there.
[01:23:37.236 --> 01:23:38.257]  What's the website address?
[01:23:39.218 --> 01:23:44.083]  Redeclarationofindependence.com And then I would imagine a .com, yeah.
[01:23:44.404 --> 01:23:45.725]  So what else is on your mind, Eric?
[01:23:46.773 --> 01:23:59.122]  Oh, well, you know, I can't call into your show without complimenting you, and here's what I have to say this time, and it's indisputable that I think, and I think many others think that you deserve the title of the king of talk radio.
[01:23:59.482 --> 01:24:00.342]  I don't know about that.
[01:24:00.383 --> 01:24:07.467]  I don't want to be the king of this kingdom of liars and altruist communists that call themselves conservatives, but thanks for the call, Eric.
[01:24:07.587 --> 01:24:08.608]  I really appreciate it.
[01:24:08.928 --> 01:24:09.909]  Kevin in Boston.
[01:24:09.949 --> 01:24:10.750]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[01:24:10.770 --> 01:24:11.390]  Thanks for holding.
[01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.750]  Go ahead.
[01:24:13.137 --> 01:24:24.608]  Following up on what Ocinda had to say, I was watching the news the other night on that coverage of Boston Logan Airport having MP5 submachine guns issued to the security.
[01:24:24.828 --> 01:24:28.852]  By the way, Boston Logan has a NASA brain scanner in it, does it not?
[01:24:29.152 --> 01:24:29.532]  It does.
[01:24:30.073 --> 01:24:34.137]  For those that don't know, we've reached the point in the brave new world, Gattaca...
[01:24:34.961 --> 01:24:39.526]  Where they have a brain scanner, and of course it doesn't work.
[01:24:39.686 --> 01:24:42.369]  It's all, the lie detector doesn't work.
[01:24:42.429 --> 01:24:45.071]  But now you know how old a computer says you're a terrorist.
[01:24:45.312 --> 01:24:46.373]  Go ahead, I'll quit interrupting.
[01:24:46.393 --> 01:24:48.154]  That's how crazy things have gotten.
[01:24:48.194 --> 01:24:48.555]  Go ahead.
[01:24:48.875 --> 01:24:53.680]  Well, I just wanted to, I know you'd feel comforted, and the neocons out there would as well, to hear that
[01:24:54.048 --> 01:25:03.593]  These MP5 submachine guns that was reported will have silencers on them so that not to cause pandemonium if they need to use them like those loud 9mm handguns that they have.
[01:25:03.913 --> 01:25:14.878]  Oh, so now they'll just spray piles of them like they do in Iraq if they protest, and it'll be freedom spraying masses of dead children splattered to thuds, their guts hanging out.
[01:25:15.098 --> 01:25:15.718]  Sounds good.
[01:25:16.419 --> 01:25:17.139]  It sure does.
[01:25:17.159 --> 01:25:20.921]  Well, I ordered your movies, and I'm talking to everybody I can around here.
[01:25:21.523 --> 01:25:25.784]  And, you know, somebody said something on your show the other day that made sense.
[01:25:26.264 --> 01:25:31.266]  If there's 280 million people in this country, if 1% listens, that's 2.8 million people.
[01:25:31.306 --> 01:25:32.946]  That's a lot more of us than there is of them.
[01:25:34.167 --> 01:25:36.067]  Well, even a lot of the cops are starting to wake up.
[01:25:36.107 --> 01:25:44.669]  I mean, when they got a brain reader, and, of course, folks, a NASA brain scanner, if your brain shows a lot of activity, it means you're agitated and men walk over.
[01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:46.230]  It says this in the news.
[01:25:47.032 --> 01:25:48.893]  I heard them say this on CBS a few months ago.
[01:25:48.913 --> 01:25:49.714]  I found the article.
[01:25:50.054 --> 01:25:51.174]  I almost ran off the road.
[01:25:51.635 --> 01:25:52.555]  Logan was the first.
[01:25:52.615 --> 01:25:53.536]  Four others have done it.
[01:25:54.016 --> 01:26:01.780]  You walk under, everyone is brain scanned by a powerful MMR, MRI, Magnetic Image Resonance System.
[01:26:03.041 --> 01:26:06.523]  And if it shows a large level of action...
[01:26:07.859 --> 01:26:09.820]  They pull you over and question you.
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:12.121]  I mean, they're scanning our brains now?
[01:26:12.161 --> 01:26:13.162]  Does that make you angry?
[01:26:13.402 --> 01:26:13.742]  It did.
[01:26:14.022 --> 01:26:19.144]  My wife was in New York, and she came home with dust on her clothes from the towers, and I was ready to go fight myself.
[01:26:19.624 --> 01:26:22.506]  But I'm still ready to fight, but I'm fighting the Infowar along with you.
[01:26:22.806 --> 01:26:24.367]  Oh, you found out who attacked the towers?
[01:26:24.547 --> 01:26:25.087]  I sure did.
[01:26:25.467 --> 01:26:26.568]  And who attacked the towers?
[01:26:26.768 --> 01:26:27.888]  George Bush and his cronies.
[01:26:28.428 --> 01:26:29.149]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:29.349 --> 01:26:29.989]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:32.911 --> 01:26:33.851]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.291 --> 01:26:35.812]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.796 --> 01:26:39.578]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:44.382]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[01:26:50.686 --> 01:26:53.268]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible.
[01:26:53.288 --> 01:26:53.348]  3-888-803-4438.

[01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:26.086]  We're good to go.
[01:28:11.897 --> 01:28:15.721]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[01:28:17.602 --> 01:28:21.366]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[01:28:22.827 --> 01:28:27.451]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[01:28:28.252 --> 01:28:31.155]  And they whisper the word, Revelation.
[01:28:33.477 --> 01:28:37.581]  There are men coming down from the valleys.
[01:28:39.298 --> 01:28:54.082]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Revolution!
[01:28:56.583 --> 01:29:06.086]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[01:29:08.542 --> 01:29:20.576]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When I
[01:29:44.944 --> 01:29:46.445]  All right, my friends.
[01:29:46.485 --> 01:29:48.087]  Welcome back.
[01:29:48.127 --> 01:29:50.228]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:29:50.268 --> 01:29:58.435]  I'm just going to take three more calls from Ron and Ida and Curtis that I've got to get into.
[01:30:15.450 --> 01:30:16.571]  This is the amazing news.
[01:30:17.051 --> 01:30:18.413]  Ron in New York.
[01:30:18.433 --> 01:30:19.333]  You're on the air, Ron.
[01:30:19.353 --> 01:30:19.954]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:20.895]  Hi, Alex.
[01:30:21.255 --> 01:30:21.655]  How you doing?
[01:30:21.895 --> 01:30:27.440]  Alex, you know, you mentioned TV talk show hosts like Sean Hannity and several others.
[01:30:28.699 --> 01:30:34.122]  By the way, that Hannity has an awfully bad habit of always jamming his finger right in the face of many of his guests.
[01:30:34.342 --> 01:30:36.543]  I don't think he ever learned basic politeness.
[01:30:36.903 --> 01:30:40.605]  Well, neither did I when you got somebody that says every child needs a microchip.
[01:30:41.105 --> 01:30:42.966]  By the way, did I mention I'm a conservative?
[01:30:43.006 --> 01:30:48.689]  I mean, you know, this guy is an ultra-big government pimp promoter, and he calls himself a conservative.
[01:30:49.049 --> 01:30:50.850]  That's precisely what he is, and you know something?
[01:30:52.230 --> 01:30:55.272]  Your listeners, who are very intelligent, very capable people...
[01:30:55.948 --> 01:30:56.549]  We're good to go.
[01:31:19.048 --> 01:31:22.914]  Was a troublemaking adolescent who came from a Long Island, New York community.
[01:31:23.314 --> 01:31:24.616]  That's a very interesting thing.
[01:31:24.676 --> 01:31:26.619]  Maybe that needs to be looked into further.
[01:31:26.939 --> 01:31:30.084]  And it tells you something about what the real makeup of this man is.
[01:31:30.965 --> 01:31:32.707]  Michael Savage, who you mentioned.
[01:31:33.228 --> 01:31:34.510]  The guy used to hang out.
[01:31:35.163 --> 01:31:38.204]  In the late 50s, in beatnik bars in Greenwich Village, New York.
[01:31:38.224 --> 01:31:39.805]  Well, that's one of the major articles.
[01:31:39.865 --> 01:31:42.366]  He's a beatnik communist.
[01:31:42.386 --> 01:31:43.066]  That's admitted.
[01:31:43.406 --> 01:31:44.027]  Now, I understand.
[01:31:44.047 --> 01:31:49.029]  I don't know... The communists figured out, hey, and now you hear him on the air, and he buys a discreet of the government, put him in a work camp.
[01:31:49.229 --> 01:31:50.970]  What do you expect from a dirty beatnik?
[01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:56.152]  Now, most of your listeners may not know what that was about, that whole beat generation, okay?
[01:31:56.192 --> 01:32:01.814]  It was about degenerating our children, starting what we now see happening today, the drugs, all of it.
[01:32:02.054 --> 01:32:03.175]  But it's time to look into that.
[01:32:03.355 --> 01:32:04.075]  Here in New York...
[01:32:04.455 --> 01:32:07.776]  We have a popular local broadcaster in this country.
[01:32:07.796 --> 01:32:11.058]  The guy admits he's a, quote, former beatnik.
[01:32:12.298 --> 01:32:13.499]  Yeah, and I find his choice.
[01:32:13.539 --> 01:32:14.499]  He went to Berkeley.
[01:32:14.799 --> 01:32:18.561]  Now, of all the universities he could have gone to if he was such a conservative, why did he choose Berkeley?
[01:32:18.581 --> 01:32:20.902]  I'm telling you, the liberals have taken over, to use their term.
[01:32:21.162 --> 01:32:26.624]  And there was another guy, we have a broadcaster locally, who positions himself as a moral paragon.
[01:32:27.004 --> 01:32:33.947]  Yet for those of us who are a little bit older, I can remember 30 years ago when this guy, and he was a radio announcer, his name is Bob Grant,
[01:32:34.522 --> 01:32:39.165]  He took, I believe it was six middle-aged housewives to a XXX movie to see their reaction.
[01:32:39.566 --> 01:32:42.928]  Now he's on the radio moralizing to you and me and the rest of us.
[01:32:43.429 --> 01:32:44.649]  Come on, we gotta dig.
[01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:50.033]  Who says you're not moral if you don't give in to the thumb scanners and the police state and the cops and the black ski masks?
[01:32:50.454 --> 01:32:51.575]  And that's another thing, too.
[01:32:51.975 --> 01:32:53.316]  Keep this in mind, alright?
[01:32:53.516 --> 01:32:54.957]  This is all plain and simple.
[01:32:54.977 --> 01:32:57.479]  It's just old-fashioned, paranoid...
[01:32:57.955 --> 01:32:58.975]  War profiteering.
[01:32:59.075 --> 01:33:02.076]  Many, if you watch these news talk shows on cable, okay?
[01:33:02.116 --> 01:33:03.256]  Well, they say it's not about oil.
[01:33:03.296 --> 01:33:04.097]  In a way, that's true.
[01:33:04.417 --> 01:33:05.117]  Oil's a part of it.
[01:33:05.137 --> 01:33:10.438]  It's weapon sales, a political diversion and destruction, and a way to set up a police state.
[01:33:10.578 --> 01:33:14.359]  And it's sales of microchips and x-ray devices and the rest of these P.T.
[01:33:14.399 --> 01:33:17.820]  Barnum devices that they're using on you to take away your civil liberties.
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:22.641]  If you look at these news talk shows, okay, many of them always invite experts on in security.
[01:33:22.681 --> 01:33:25.722]  These people come out of the, I guess what you would call the
[01:33:26.303 --> 01:33:30.724]  I don't know if it's military industrial or criminal justice industrial complex.
[01:33:30.764 --> 01:33:32.064]  You could put the name you like to it.
[01:33:32.845 --> 01:33:40.686]  They're trying to sell these devices so naturally they're going to whip up the paranoia and convince you they should have a brain scanner in Logan to scan you.
[01:33:41.167 --> 01:33:42.407]  These people aren't scanning you.
[01:33:42.427 --> 01:33:44.867]  They're scamming you and they're taking away your civil rights.
[01:33:45.388 --> 01:33:46.828]  This is what this is all about.
[01:33:47.389 --> 01:33:48.370]  That's what this is all about.
[01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:52.053]  These people are making profit on stampeding the general population.
[01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:55.616]  And then when you confront them, hey, you're taking my guns, you're going to reinstate that.
[01:33:55.716 --> 01:33:58.979]  You're a subversive or a communist, or you love Saddam Hussein.
[01:33:59.019 --> 01:34:00.240]  This is the reaction.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:02.241]  This is what they throw back at you.
[01:34:02.261 --> 01:34:05.104]  Hey, imprisoning Americans for criticizing the government, that's not American.
[01:34:05.224 --> 01:34:06.285]  Shut up, you dirty liberal!
[01:34:06.525 --> 01:34:08.507]  I'm like, excuse me, I wasn't a former beatnik.
[01:34:08.527 --> 01:34:10.748]  I don't look like I was dipped in motor oil.
[01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.969]  That's true, right.
[01:34:12.130 --> 01:34:13.691]  And this is how we've got to fight.
[01:34:14.306 --> 01:34:17.389]  We've got to start to collect background data on these people.
[01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:18.811]  That's in the public domain.
[01:34:18.911 --> 01:34:20.873]  I'm saying that we should do this all quite legal.
[01:34:21.013 --> 01:34:23.296]  No, they'll just say being a communist is conservative.
[01:34:23.316 --> 01:34:23.956]  That's what they've done.
[01:34:24.076 --> 01:34:28.241]  And we should bring it out in a more broader and open way.
[01:34:28.832 --> 01:34:34.834]  What the background is of these people who now stand here and pontificate to us what their backgrounds are.
[01:34:35.194 --> 01:34:37.355]  This has got to stop, you know, because this nonsense has got to stop.
[01:34:37.395 --> 01:34:38.376]  We've got to stop thinking.
[01:34:38.956 --> 01:34:42.437]  We've got to stop thinking in terms of Republican, Democrat.
[01:34:42.457 --> 01:34:44.298]  Oh, no, they're all a bunch of dirt balls working together.
[01:34:44.398 --> 01:34:49.580]  And start thinking in terms of good American and an un-American.
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:50.280]  You got it.
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:50.960]  Thanks for the call.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.441]  I'll look at his pro-freedom, anti-freedom.
[01:34:54.102 --> 01:34:56.023]  And the more freedom we give up, the less safe we are.
[01:34:56.043 --> 01:34:56.904]  It's a disgusting joke.
[01:34:57.244 --> 01:34:58.705]  Ida in Nebraska.
[01:34:58.845 --> 01:34:59.525]  Ida, you're on the air.
[01:34:59.565 --> 01:34:59.946]  Go ahead.
[01:34:59.966 --> 01:35:04.048]  Hello, Ida.
[01:35:04.348 --> 01:35:06.630]  Yes, thank you for taking my call.
[01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:16.836]  The reason I'm calling is I listen to you almost every day, and I understand we've got 250 million of the happiest slaves in the world living in this country, and that's why they'll never revolt.
[01:35:17.649 --> 01:35:18.590]  I have revolted.
[01:35:18.610 --> 01:35:21.292]  I have been thrown in jail five times.
[01:35:21.892 --> 01:35:29.237]  I am now looking at a year and a half in jail plus a $1,500 fine simply because I refused to go down the road without a driver's license.
[01:35:30.646 --> 01:35:41.392]  Yeah, and the federal law actually says that, and the court rulings say that, you don't have to have a license for the generally accepted conveyance, but that's a horse and buggy still.
[01:35:41.432 --> 01:35:59.282]  Hey, Alex, I've used every definition coming down the pike in court, and the judge turns around, the prosecutor objects, and the judge turns around, and he says it's okay to object, I can't use it, and the next thing I know I'm getting paraded off to jail.
[01:36:00.447 --> 01:36:03.171]  You need to go ahead and appeal it up to a higher court.
[01:36:03.251 --> 01:36:07.577]  But, yeah, these courts, even federal judges have said, are just rubber-stamped kangaroo courts now.
[01:36:08.298 --> 01:36:16.970]  Alex, I am looking at a point right now where I don't know what to do anymore because they simply refuse to listen to anything.
[01:36:17.765 --> 01:36:19.666]  I have been beat up twice by cops.
[01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:24.370]  I've had my car impounded three times when it was sitting on private property.
[01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:29.714]  Twice my sister says, I'll take it home for her, and the cop stands there and says, no, it's getting impounded.
[01:36:30.034 --> 01:36:35.017]  As far as I'm concerned... Ma'am, ma'am, they know who you are, and they're targeting you when they see you drive around?
[01:36:35.738 --> 01:36:36.198]  Oh, sure.
[01:36:36.418 --> 01:36:41.862]  But like I said, cops... Because I've driven around for many years without a driver's license and never had a problem.
[01:36:42.002 --> 01:36:43.844]  One cop admitted he's stalking me.
[01:36:45.365 --> 01:36:56.550]  Well, ma'am, you need to maybe move out of that area or run for political office, or maybe you need to go ahead and file in their system a civil rights lawsuit for religious reasons.
[01:36:56.650 --> 01:36:57.410]  Man, let me just finish.
[01:36:57.690 --> 01:36:57.951]  Okay.
[01:36:58.111 --> 01:37:12.497]  For religious reasons that is against your religion to go through this thumb scanning and face scanning, which I think doesn't Nebraska do that, and that it's against your religion, and then use all those cases where they've arrested you and sue them personally.
[01:37:13.908 --> 01:37:18.169]  Well, as far as I'm concerned, cops are nothing but money-making machines for the corporate state.
[01:37:18.429 --> 01:37:18.989]  Well, they are.
[01:37:19.330 --> 01:37:24.191]  And some of them are good people, some of them are bad people, but the system is a fraud and is not broken.
[01:37:24.251 --> 01:37:25.411]  It's working very well.
[01:37:26.392 --> 01:37:30.013]  I appreciate the call, and I'm sorry you're having all these problems.
[01:37:30.073 --> 01:37:31.113]  It's going to get worse and worse.
[01:37:31.413 --> 01:37:36.795]  You'll have to have an ID card to have a job, and they'll decide what type of job you can have with security.
[01:37:37.315 --> 01:37:41.856]  And there won't be any cash to have an underground economy because we're going to the thumb scan and the face scan.
[01:37:42.566 --> 01:37:44.348]  And the colored money's already coming out, folks.
[01:37:45.169 --> 01:37:47.231]  Curtis in Louisiana that I'm going to news.
[01:37:47.291 --> 01:37:48.051]  Curtis, you're on the air.
[01:37:48.071 --> 01:37:48.472]  Go ahead.
[01:37:48.792 --> 01:37:49.773]  Hey, Alex.
[01:37:49.853 --> 01:38:02.225]  I was calling about when Donald Rumsfeld went to Iraq to visit the troops, and I heard one of the reporters say that he told them in private that there was no humanitarian crisis there.
[01:38:03.386 --> 01:38:04.567]  He didn't say that in private.
[01:38:04.647 --> 01:38:05.348]  It was the...
[01:38:07.003 --> 01:38:08.804]  The head general... I've got the article.
[01:38:08.864 --> 01:38:11.425]  It's on the main page of Infowars.com.
[01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:17.489]  The picture is a gorilla with an upside-down American flag that says Made in China on it.
[01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:20.050]  And it's a Reuters story.
[01:38:20.110 --> 01:38:29.155]  And the general who's taken over Iraq says, we should beat our chest, walk around bugging our eyes and our chest out, strutting, because we're Americans.
[01:38:29.716 --> 01:38:31.897]  And he says there is no humanitarian crisis.
[01:38:31.917 --> 01:38:33.157]  He said it at a press conference.
[01:38:33.738 --> 01:38:34.958]  As 60% of the children...
[01:38:36.079 --> 01:38:37.480]  Yeah, and I'm thinking along the same lines.
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.582]  Well, I'm glad we got Curtis on when we did, because his cell phone just cut out.
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:00.780]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:01.521]  Oh, you're still there.
[01:39:01.561 --> 01:39:01.901]  Go ahead.
[01:39:02.181 --> 01:39:08.765]  Yeah, no, they were saying that 50% of the power was on, and, you know, the power's been off for probably, I guess, about a month.
[01:39:09.804 --> 01:39:19.888]  And they were talking about the unclean water, so I was just trying to figure out how they came up to the conclusion that there was no humanitarian crisis when you don't even have power or clean drinking water.
[01:39:20.088 --> 01:39:22.629]  Well, they said there's no conflict of interest for the first time in U.S.
[01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:23.009]  history.
[01:39:23.029 --> 01:39:24.770]  A $7 billion bid to Halliburton.
[01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:31.613]  Nick Cheney's company, CEO until 2000, being given a $7 billion contract for Iraq.
[01:39:32.173 --> 01:39:33.754]  I mean, it's a joke, sir.
[01:39:34.174 --> 01:39:37.155]  Well, does the truth... Do you think that the average...
[01:39:37.975 --> 01:39:50.460]  No, they just have Fox, the ultra-commy channel that calls itself conservative, beamed into them.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.680]  Oh, everybody loves you.
[01:39:51.841 --> 01:39:52.601]  Oh, it's great.
[01:39:52.721 --> 01:39:54.041]  Oh, you're the greatest heroes ever.
[01:39:54.381 --> 01:39:57.163]  By the way, we're cutting all your benefits right now, but so what?
[01:39:57.183 --> 01:39:59.243]  You know, that's the system.
[01:40:00.524 --> 01:40:03.145]  Okay, well, that's all I wanted to say.
[01:40:03.165 --> 01:40:04.325]  I just wanted to call about that.
[01:40:04.685 --> 01:40:05.986]  All right, thank you, Curtis, for the call.
[01:40:07.136 --> 01:40:17.084]  Yeah, I read those quotes of the top general over there saying that we should beat our chest, stick our chest out, suck our bellies in, strut around as Americans, and wave flags.
[01:40:17.805 --> 01:40:20.427]  And, by the way, there's no humanitarian crisis.
[01:40:20.527 --> 01:40:21.408]  Everything is fine.
[01:40:21.548 --> 01:40:22.889]  Everything is fine in Iraq.
[01:40:23.049 --> 01:40:23.469]  Okay.
[01:40:25.111 --> 01:40:28.874]  And the moon is what gives us our light during the day.
[01:40:28.934 --> 01:40:30.575]  The moon is actually a sun.
[01:40:31.116 --> 01:40:32.597]  And the moon is made of cheese, too.
[01:40:32.637 --> 01:40:36.140]  And I'm a Chinese jet pilot from Mars who's friends with the Easter Bunny.
[01:40:36.678 --> 01:40:38.179]  You know, you want to believe this stuff, fine.
[01:40:39.979 --> 01:40:41.000]  This is how ridiculous.
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:43.561]  Israel studies Hafez Mosul pipeline.
[01:40:44.581 --> 01:40:47.222]  And they say they're going to get the pipeline and get the oil.
[01:40:48.323 --> 01:40:49.923]  And then our government says it's not about oil.
[01:40:50.964 --> 01:40:56.026]  But even Jane's Weapons Dictionary says that it's about oil.
[01:40:57.326 --> 01:40:58.106]  I have it right here.
[01:40:58.887 --> 01:40:59.467]  Jane's.
[01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:01.648]  Jane's is the big...
[01:41:02.828 --> 01:41:05.729]  Weapons Publication Encyclopedia.
[01:41:06.289 --> 01:41:07.249]  They track and trace everything.
[01:41:07.269 --> 01:41:08.429]  They're a whole news service.
[01:41:09.150 --> 01:41:12.631]  And they say, James says, it's about oil.
[01:41:13.451 --> 01:41:15.831]  Again, that's one part of it is about oil.
[01:41:16.872 --> 01:41:21.353]  And so that's the reality of the situation.
[01:41:22.813 --> 01:41:24.213]  So what do you think about them apples?
[01:41:24.874 --> 01:41:30.215]  Says James, James.com, oil from Iraq, an Israeli pipe dream.
[01:41:30.954 --> 01:41:41.599]  Israel stands to benefit greatly from the U.S.-led war in Iraq, primarily by getting rid of the implacable foe in President Saddam Hussein and the threat from the weapons of mass destruction he was alleged to possess.
[01:41:41.999 --> 01:41:44.140]  But it seems the Israelis have other things in mind.
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:54.325]  An intriguing pointer to one potential significant benefit was a report by Haratz on March 31st that the Minister of National Infrastructure, Joseph Prudinsky, we told you about this a month ago,
[01:41:55.484 --> 01:42:02.008]  ...was considering a possibility of reopening a long-defunct oil pipeline from Mosul to the Mediterranean port of Haifa.
[01:42:02.429 --> 01:42:11.535]  With Israel lacking energy resources of its own and depending on highly expensive oil from Russia, reopening a pipeline would transform its economy.
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:27.172]  To resume subsidies, supplies for Mosul and Haifa would require the removal and approval of whatever Iraqi government emerges, and presumably the Jordanian government, though those territories it would be likely to run.
[01:42:28.334 --> 01:42:39.580]  And it says, Pardinsky's ministry was reported to have said on the 9th of April that it would hold discussions with Jordanian authorities on resuming oil supplies for Mosul, with one source saying the Jordanians were optimistic.
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:44.762]  Jordan, aware of the deep political sensitivities involved, immediately denied there were any such talks.
[01:42:45.683 --> 01:42:47.243]  Well, folks, I read the report.
[01:42:47.304 --> 01:42:49.184]  I read what he said in the Israeli paper.
[01:42:50.725 --> 01:42:51.886]  Our government has said it.
[01:42:51.966 --> 01:42:56.088]  The general who says everything's fine, who runs things, says they're going to do it.
[01:42:57.368 --> 01:42:58.829]  They're going to build that pipeline.
[01:42:58.849 --> 01:43:01.951]  They're going to send that oil for free to Israel.
[01:43:03.131 --> 01:43:06.613]  And so that's the reality of what's being done.
[01:43:08.614 --> 01:43:10.155]  And then to deny it is just crazy.
[01:43:12.236 --> 01:43:15.458]  Continuing, banned on campus toys.
[01:43:18.139 --> 01:43:19.240]  Let me cover that in a second.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:20.300]  Toy guns have been banned.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.501]  You get arrested if you have them.
[01:43:23.255 --> 01:43:24.276]  I'm just overwhelmed, folks.
[01:43:24.296 --> 01:43:26.437]  I go into hyperdrive and then I just start sputtering.
[01:43:26.477 --> 01:43:28.378]  I don't know where to start or where to end.
[01:43:28.658 --> 01:43:29.098]  Here's one.
[01:43:29.178 --> 01:43:32.280]  Paper currency quarantine and China's SARS war.
[01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:33.720]  Reuters.
[01:43:33.861 --> 01:43:40.244]  Money may be the root of all evil, but China is trying to make sure it won't be a source of SARS.
[01:43:41.484 --> 01:43:50.469]  Now, they already have public service announcements here in this country of how, quote, cash is dirty and how we need to get rid of it to the safe, cashless society.
[01:43:51.525 --> 01:43:59.909]  Well, the Central People's Bank of China was putting more new cash into circulation and holding used banknotes for 24 hours before putting it back on the people's hands.
[01:44:00.430 --> 01:44:13.536]  The People's Daily newspaper said on its website on Tuesday the Communist Party mouthpiece said some banks were even sterilizing Grammy bills and showering them with ultra-violent radiation to try to kill the SARS virus, which has killed 148 people and infected more than 3,300 in China.
[01:44:13.556 --> 01:44:14.057]  Like, 300 globally.
[01:44:14.077 --> 01:44:14.537]  Not even that many.
[01:44:14.557 --> 01:44:14.937]  Folks, this thing...
[01:44:21.099 --> 01:44:22.641]  Millions die every year from flu.
[01:44:23.201 --> 01:44:23.962]  This is nothing.
[01:44:24.242 --> 01:44:25.663]  They can't even isolate the virus.
[01:44:25.743 --> 01:44:27.905]  It's hysteria, as the Toronto Star said.
[01:44:27.925 --> 01:44:29.427]  It is a U.N.
[01:44:29.727 --> 01:44:30.748]  power grab.
[01:44:31.229 --> 01:44:31.869]  I didn't say it.
[01:44:31.889 --> 01:44:33.110]  Toronto Star did.
[01:44:35.032 --> 01:44:38.255]  Continuing, Key McVeigh witness testimony questioned AP.
[01:44:38.896 --> 01:44:42.479]  Turns out they withheld and covered up evidence of other accomplices.
[01:44:42.519 --> 01:44:43.260]  Of course they did.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.722]  There was feds inside planting the bombs.
[01:44:47.604 --> 01:44:52.608]  I want to cover this 9-1-1 cover-up in the final segment of this hour.
[01:44:53.408 --> 01:44:56.010]  There is so much coming up, and I am going to cover it all.
[01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:59.913]  If I have to suspend all calls in the third hour, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:45:00.133 --> 01:45:01.234]  We're going to cover all the news.
[01:45:01.254 --> 01:45:02.014]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:45:02.395 --> 01:45:02.815]  Stay with me.
[01:45:03.576 --> 01:45:10.403]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:45:10.744 --> 01:45:12.125]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:14.508]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:45:14.668 --> 01:45:16.750]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:21.976]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:45:22.316 --> 01:45:26.220]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:28.361]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:45:28.441 --> 01:45:39.088]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plantable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:41.130]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:45.192]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.

[01:46:04.119 --> 01:46:08.641]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:46:08.961 --> 01:46:13.062]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:46:13.362 --> 01:46:13.903]  We listened.
[01:46:14.203 --> 01:46:19.185]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:46:19.465 --> 01:46:19.945]  We listened.
[01:46:20.345 --> 01:46:23.366]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:46:23.806 --> 01:46:24.347]  We listened.
[01:46:24.807 --> 01:46:28.148]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:46:28.188 --> 01:46:28.768]  We're good to go.

[01:47:02.501 --> 01:47:03.262]  Are you prepared?
[01:47:03.442 --> 01:47:05.843]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[01:47:06.063 --> 01:47:10.485]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[01:47:10.786 --> 01:47:14.267]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[01:47:14.488 --> 01:47:16.629]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[01:47:17.349 --> 01:47:17.969]  We're good to go.
[01:47:44.588 --> 01:47:49.251]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[01:47:49.471 --> 01:47:53.393]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[01:47:53.533 --> 01:47:54.794]  Call the Ark Institute today.
[01:47:54.914 --> 01:47:55.414]  Toll free 1-800-255-1912.

[01:47:56.555 --> 01:47:56.735]  Music
[01:48:15.225 --> 01:48:25.254]  All right, if you're not excited about what's happening, there's something wrong with you.
[01:48:25.434 --> 01:48:27.395]  There's something wrong with you.
[01:48:43.027 --> 01:48:46.731]  Pro-gun women's group, alleged setup by John Walsh.
[01:48:47.773 --> 01:48:48.834]  This is CNS News.
[01:48:48.854 --> 01:48:54.200]  They told them it was a pro-gun, you know, about women and guns, and it turned out to be a gun demonization piece.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:55.521]  I'll get more into that in the next hour.
[01:48:56.082 --> 01:48:58.285]  Some good news on the Second Amendment front, but they don't care.
[01:48:58.305 --> 01:49:00.227]  They'll just come up with a system that does work.
[01:49:00.942 --> 01:49:02.844]  Ballistic imaging easy to detect.
[01:49:03.424 --> 01:49:08.288]  NCPA research also points to high-cost unreliability of imaging database.
[01:49:08.428 --> 01:49:09.349]  The government doesn't care.
[01:49:09.389 --> 01:49:10.750]  It's about adding more cost.
[01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:14.673]  It's about going after your guns and registering you as a gun owner.
[01:49:14.713 --> 01:49:16.515]  That's all this is, is gun registration.
[01:49:16.815 --> 01:49:18.857]  The National Ballistic Database, Bush wants.
[01:49:20.578 --> 01:49:30.126]  Also, continuing with the news that we have here, justice altered to false testimony allegations.
[01:49:31.062 --> 01:49:37.545]  And it turns out the Justice Department was alerted, was involved in altering evidence, covering stuff up, destroying evidence.
[01:49:37.565 --> 01:49:39.265]  This is from the Associated Press.
[01:49:40.126 --> 01:49:43.827]  September 11th panel member questions delay of material.
[01:49:43.947 --> 01:49:50.190]  Washington Times, officials of the Blue Ribbon Commission, the Whitewash Commission, they were going to have Kissinger.
[01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:52.251]  You talk about conflict of interest.
[01:49:52.271 --> 01:49:53.831]  They called it Independent Commission.
[01:49:54.292 --> 01:49:57.573]  It's like having Joseph Mingala investigate death camps.
[01:49:58.394 --> 01:50:11.702]  Officials of the Blue Ribbon Commission set up to investigate the September 11th attacks will be questioned at its meeting today about the decision to let federal officials screen materials before releasing them to the commission members.
[01:50:12.462 --> 01:50:14.483]  And they sealed the old commission data.
[01:50:14.844 --> 01:50:17.465]  They don't even want whitewashed commission stuff coming out.
[01:50:18.205 --> 01:50:20.807]  Stuff that was live on C-SPAN, they don't want it coming out.
[01:50:22.589 --> 01:50:25.350]  They don't want it on the congressional record, folks, what happened.
[01:50:25.370 --> 01:50:26.791]  Because, I mean, it even came out in court.
[01:50:26.811 --> 01:50:30.312]  Well, why were you paying for the hijackers' homes and cars and credit cards, government?
[01:50:31.412 --> 01:50:33.273]  Struck that from the record.
[01:50:34.154 --> 01:50:40.056]  The Secrets of September 11th, White House is battling to keep a report on the terror attack secret.
[01:50:40.076 --> 01:50:43.117]  Does 2004 election have anything to do with it?
[01:50:44.016 --> 01:50:45.117]  This is MSNBC.
[01:50:45.878 --> 01:50:49.461]  But see, then they'll release the report, and it'll just have the whitewashed stuff.
[01:50:49.481 --> 01:50:54.306]  They act like the White House doesn't want you to know the truth, and then some whitewashed report comes out.
[01:50:54.766 --> 01:51:04.595]  Folks, you need to learn the whole truth of 9-1-1, because believe me, it is serious, it is bad, and it's encyclopedic.
[01:51:04.755 --> 01:51:07.558]  That's my frustration, is trying to cover all of this.
[01:51:09.574 --> 01:51:26.727]  Even as White House political aides plot a 2004 campaign plan designed to capitalize on the emotions and issues raised by September 11th terror attacks, it's like that Hollywood movie where the arsonist is the arson investigator and makes himself a big hero out of the arson.
[01:51:27.748 --> 01:51:35.734]  Administration officials are waging a behind-the-scenes battle to restrict public disclosure of key events relating to the attacks.
[01:51:36.707 --> 01:51:42.851]  When we start the next hour, I'll get more into this and what life will be like under the New World Order.
[01:51:42.971 --> 01:51:44.472]  We have covered about a third of it.
[01:51:44.873 --> 01:51:49.016]  I'll have to just jam it all in calmly in the third hour.
[01:51:49.056 --> 01:51:52.018]  I don't know what's been wrong with me this week, but I've been more fired up than usual.
[01:51:53.399 --> 01:52:02.445]  Before I end this segment, if you want to find out what really happened with 9-1-1, you want to see all the information, the globalists admitting it,
[01:52:03.495 --> 01:52:07.717]  The documents, the news articles, in a professional package.

[01:52:09.137 --> 01:52:11.058]  Get part two of that, Masters of Terror.
[01:52:12.058 --> 01:52:12.878]  My two films.

[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:17.440]  It's only $12.
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:18.320]  The films are $25.95.
[01:52:18.901 --> 01:52:19.481]  Order three or more.
[01:52:19.541 --> 01:52:20.081]  They drop down to $20.
[01:52:21.021 --> 01:52:21.822]  Get the films.
[01:52:21.982 --> 01:52:22.702]  Get them today.
[01:52:22.822 --> 01:52:23.622]  Get the word out.
[01:52:23.702 --> 01:52:24.403]  Make copies.
[01:52:24.463 --> 01:52:25.383]  Warn everybody!
[01:52:26.218 --> 01:52:27.779]  They're using terror to enslave us.
[01:52:27.839 --> 01:52:31.021]  The films are waking up 90% of those that see them.
[01:52:31.361 --> 01:52:32.782]  So no excuse not to get them.
[01:52:32.802 --> 01:52:35.364]  You've got the tool to wake people up and save America.
[01:52:35.384 --> 01:52:36.065]  These are hardcore.
[01:52:36.085 --> 01:52:36.185]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:52:36.205 --> 01:52:36.585]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:52:36.605 --> 01:52:38.266]  4infowars.com or net.
[01:52:38.306 --> 01:52:39.187]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:53.906 --> 01:53:00.752]  As a listener to the Genesis Communications Network, you're aware of the many health dangers that have been unleashed upon an unsuspecting public.
[01:53:01.213 --> 01:53:04.656]  We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but how do we do that?
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:12.983]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:20.544 --> 01:53:21.185]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.845 --> 01:53:22.906]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:23.607 --> 01:53:24.748]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:25.368 --> 01:53:26.189]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.970 --> 01:53:27.830]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.850 --> 01:53:32.454]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.695 --> 01:53:36.818]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.719 --> 01:53:39.761]  All right, my friends.
[01:53:39.961 --> 01:53:41.722]  It's Thursday, the 1st of May, 2003.
[01:53:41.983 --> 01:53:45.225]  I know we have some callers holding.
[01:53:45.245 --> 01:53:46.987]  We'll get to your calls, Warren and others.
[01:53:48.334 --> 01:53:48.995]  We're good to go.
[01:53:49.035 --> 01:53:49.595]  We're good to go.
[01:53:49.615 --> 01:53:50.276]  We're good to go.
[01:54:12.166 --> 01:54:22.776]  Watching serial killer, control freak demons build a cage for humanity is very energizing.
[01:54:23.417 --> 01:54:25.158]  I just am energized to resist them.
[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:33.166]  I've asked God to make me a vessel to fight the New World Order, and sometimes I just think there's too much.
[01:54:33.226 --> 01:54:34.427]  I mean, I'm just too energized.
[01:54:34.487 --> 01:54:34.707]  I just...
[01:54:35.578 --> 01:54:36.778]  I've got all the information.
[01:54:36.818 --> 01:54:37.579]  I know what they're doing.
[01:54:37.599 --> 01:54:39.659]  I know what their plans are and what their operations are.
[01:54:39.699 --> 01:54:47.041]  And like my mouth, my speech centers cannot, I don't think, articulate the globalist program properly to you.
[01:54:48.141 --> 01:54:48.921]  It's just horrible.
[01:54:50.001 --> 01:54:52.062]  It's so bad to see this happening.
[01:54:52.102 --> 01:54:53.242]  It's so horrible.
[01:54:54.382 --> 01:54:56.703]  This is not something you can ignore, my friends.
[01:54:57.851 --> 01:54:58.811]  There is so much news.
[01:54:58.851 --> 01:55:04.192]  I'm going to cover a ton of news in this hour on a wide range of subjects, and I'll get to all that in the next segment.
[01:55:04.232 --> 01:55:06.973]  Let's just go to Warren in Colorado right now.
[01:55:07.073 --> 01:55:08.093]  Warren, you're on the air.
[01:55:08.153 --> 01:55:08.493]  Welcome.
[01:55:09.173 --> 01:55:10.053]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[01:55:10.093 --> 01:55:11.934]  You're doing pretty good today.
[01:55:12.734 --> 01:55:17.335]  I want to back up the gal from Nebraska, and I also want to kind of back up you.
[01:55:18.295 --> 01:55:22.876]  First of all, I live in Fort Morgan, Colorado, which is...
[01:55:24.549 --> 01:55:28.030]  Big processing beef plant for ConAgra.
[01:55:29.150 --> 01:55:43.955]  And I have first-hand knowledge that sometimes these police people pull over people who have Mexican names, and they will not have any driver's license at all.
[01:55:44.675 --> 01:55:46.015]  But I'll tell you one thing.
[01:55:46.075 --> 01:55:47.156]  They do let them go.
[01:55:47.176 --> 01:55:48.716]  They will let them go.
[01:55:48.736 --> 01:55:50.797]  Well, that's a key point you just raised.
[01:55:50.817 --> 01:55:51.577]  The illegals...
[01:55:52.529 --> 01:55:53.349]  Well, that's exactly it.
[01:55:53.369 --> 01:55:53.609]  Well, no.
[01:55:53.629 --> 01:55:53.709]  But...
[01:56:22.082 --> 01:56:41.968]  I'll tell you what, if you drive into a Mexican area, and now I have a lot of friends that are Mexicans, but I don't have too many immigrant friends, but you kind of wonder how in the world they got their driver's license in the first place if they do have one.
[01:56:42.228 --> 01:56:46.309]  And they really do not have a driver's license because they do not know the law.
[01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:51.031]  They're there for big companies to work
[01:56:51.806 --> 01:56:52.966]  Because they do work.
[01:56:53.166 --> 01:56:57.927]  Yeah, and the big companies have said, these people are here to vote our rights away because they don't even know what they're doing.
[01:56:58.467 --> 01:56:59.667]  They can't speak any language.
[01:56:59.687 --> 01:57:05.368]  They're just told what to do with their local bosses, local little bosses, barrio boss, who works for the government.
[01:57:06.089 --> 01:57:09.469]  And they're here to deindustrialize and give us cheap wages.
[01:57:09.549 --> 01:57:10.809]  Don't arrest them.
[01:57:10.829 --> 01:57:11.570]  Don't mess with them.
[01:57:11.590 --> 01:57:12.130]  And it happens.
[01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:14.810]  You, on the other hand, are middle class and got some money.
[01:57:15.070 --> 01:57:16.811]  You're to be fed on, pushed around.
[01:57:16.831 --> 01:57:19.231]  They're going to let you know to keep in line.
[01:57:20.416 --> 01:57:21.876]  Okay, Alex, you know what you're doing.
[01:57:22.236 --> 01:57:22.876]  That's for sure.
[01:57:22.896 --> 01:57:24.737]  And I'm going to back you up.
[01:57:25.137 --> 01:57:32.398]  I don't normally listen to KOA out of Denver, but it is the biggest station, and you are right.
[01:57:32.518 --> 01:57:33.538]  You are telling the truth.
[01:57:34.139 --> 01:57:40.460]  When you are on KOA, 30 callers will agree with you, and it's so exhilarating and so much fun.
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.840]  Yeah, 30 in a row, no one disagrees.
[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:47.641]  But then you can hear another show come on, and everybody agrees with the lies.
[01:57:48.955 --> 01:57:49.476]  It's incredible.
[01:57:49.496 --> 01:57:50.777]  But I'm telling you, that's my point.
[01:57:50.817 --> 01:57:52.778]  I've done these 800-plus interviews now.
[01:57:53.239 --> 01:57:54.580]  No one calls in disagreeing.
[01:57:56.201 --> 01:57:56.522]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:56.882 --> 01:57:59.484]  And, heck, you're doing a great job.
[01:58:00.165 --> 01:58:00.505]  All right.
[01:58:00.705 --> 01:58:01.826]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:58:02.747 --> 01:58:03.448]  I appreciate you.
[01:58:03.488 --> 01:58:05.089]  And we'll take more calls this hour.
[01:58:05.289 --> 01:58:08.352]  When we get back, I'm going to cover some news for a while, then we'll get into your calls.
[01:58:08.372 --> 01:58:09.032]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:09.052 --> 01:58:09.312]  Stay with me.
[01:58:14.890 --> 01:58:23.154]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:58:23.414 --> 01:58:27.755]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:58:28.056 --> 01:58:36.979]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:58:37.179 --> 01:58:40.801]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:58:41.081 --> 01:58:46.126]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:58:46.406 --> 01:58:53.153]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:58:53.633 --> 01:58:54.174]  What about you?
[01:58:54.933 --> 01:59:00.274]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:59:00.334 --> 01:59:01.495]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:59:01.515 --> 01:59:03.395]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:59:15.251 --> 01:59:22.637]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:22.897 --> 01:59:27.641]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:27.861 --> 01:59:33.506]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:33.746 --> 01:59:38.293]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:59:38.493 --> 01:59:45.663]  The casual society control grid, impanible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:59:45.683 --> 01:59:50.009]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:59:50.049 --> 01:59:51.310]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:59:51.330 --> 01:59:51.510]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:00:14.119 --> 02:00:17.761]  How many of you listening would give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[02:00:18.281 --> 02:00:19.121]  Listen up, folks.
[02:00:19.241 --> 02:00:22.643]  If you're taking vitamins in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[02:00:23.043 --> 02:00:28.425]  You see, according to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are just 10% absorbed.
[02:00:28.766 --> 02:00:33.388]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, you're literally flushing $90 down the toilet.
[02:00:34.648 --> 02:00:40.870]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, and if you want to start absorbing the nutrients that you swallow, you need to take sea silver.
[02:00:41.331 --> 02:00:50.154]  Not only does it contain every vitamin, mineral, amino acid, and enzyme known to man, but because it's in an organic liquid form, it offers a 98% absorption.
[02:00:50.454 --> 02:00:53.675]  And what that means is your body gets to keep the nutrients that you swallow.
[02:00:54.075 --> 02:00:56.056]  Try delicious tasting sea silver today.
[02:00:56.476 --> 02:00:58.957]  You'll feel a difference in two weeks or your money back.
[02:00:59.297 --> 02:00:59.598]  Call 1-888-887-2063.
[02:01:03.439 --> 02:01:03.939]  1-888-887-2063.
[02:01:04.119 --> 02:01:10.301]  Isn't it time you stopped flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[02:01:10.321 --> 02:01:10.981]  1-888-887-2063.
[02:01:11.281 --> 02:01:19.724]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:20.084 --> 02:01:22.345]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:27.603 --> 02:01:31.447]  Well, we just had a caller who I guess has heard me on KOA.
[02:01:31.507 --> 02:01:40.817]  I just picked a station randomly that I've been on where it will take 30 calls in two hours and no one calls in who disagrees.
[02:01:41.517 --> 02:01:42.959]  And I'm saying the globalists carried out 9-1-1.
[02:01:43.099 --> 02:01:44.440]  They're enslaving us.
[02:01:44.741 --> 02:01:45.802]  They shipped the drugs in.
[02:01:45.842 --> 02:01:47.403]  The New World Order is totally corrupt.
[02:01:48.424 --> 02:01:49.786]  And everybody calls in agreeing.
[02:01:50.814 --> 02:01:58.115]  And then I can be on some other station and take 20 calls, and then one guy will call and he'll go, You're a liar.
[02:01:58.195 --> 02:01:59.796]  Bush isn't trying to take my guns.
[02:01:59.816 --> 02:02:02.336]  And I'll go, Well, actually, the bill number is S-22.
[02:02:02.376 --> 02:02:03.776]  Republicans are supporting it.
[02:02:04.636 --> 02:02:06.157]  You're a lying commie.
[02:02:06.377 --> 02:02:11.738]  I tell you, you liberals come up with some plans to confuse us and get us off track.
[02:02:11.778 --> 02:02:13.158]  George Bush would never.
[02:02:13.178 --> 02:02:14.578]  He's a Christian conservative.
[02:02:15.798 --> 02:02:18.099]  And then the host will say, Well, actually, he is supporting that.
[02:02:18.159 --> 02:02:18.759]  And the guy will go,
[02:02:19.825 --> 02:02:21.606]  Oh, well, I still don't like this guy.
[02:02:21.666 --> 02:02:22.566]  Get him off here!
[02:02:22.586 --> 02:02:26.008]  I just want to turn my guns in.
[02:02:26.028 --> 02:02:28.248]  I mean, they don't say that, but they say everything else up to that.
[02:02:30.129 --> 02:02:31.750]  So they're in a delusional world.
[02:02:31.770 --> 02:02:41.794]  And I can be on Pacifica Radio or something with all the, what you would call liberals, and they're all calling and agreeing, making good points, admitting the Democrats are corrupt too, because if you're not hypocritical, they'll wake up.
[02:02:43.038 --> 02:02:46.721]  We got liberals calling in going, yeah, I see what you mean about owning guns.
[02:02:47.221 --> 02:02:48.523]  It makes a lot of sense.
[02:02:48.543 --> 02:02:51.145]  You know, if the government's tyrannical, why should we give our guns up?
[02:02:51.485 --> 02:02:52.906]  I'm beginning to realize what you're saying.
[02:02:52.926 --> 02:02:56.529]  And I did hear Australia's crime rate exploded once they took the guns.
[02:02:57.110 --> 02:03:01.213]  And then one person will call in and go, I bet you're a racist, Mr. Jones, aren't you?
[02:03:02.294 --> 02:03:05.637]  Yes, New World Order is a code word for some type of racial group you're a member of.
[02:03:05.657 --> 02:03:08.038]  And I go, no, actually, the government's calling for a New World Order.
[02:03:08.059 --> 02:03:10.901]  And I'll go, wait a minute, you work for the government, don't you?
[02:03:11.795 --> 02:03:17.618]  Do you work in intelligence, or for the FBI, or for the... Or do you work for some federal program?
[02:03:18.118 --> 02:03:19.418]  Where I work doesn't matter!
[02:03:19.819 --> 02:03:20.799]  I'll go, just answer the question.
[02:03:20.819 --> 02:03:21.980]  Well, yes, I work for the government.
[02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:26.722]  Well, hey, whoa!
[02:03:28.102 --> 02:03:35.265]  I was on in England, and big national show, the James Whale Show, and it covers the whole country.
[02:03:35.285 --> 02:03:37.266]  We're getting calls from Scotland, Ireland, wherever.
[02:03:37.286 --> 02:03:40.188]  It's a big transmitter, a couple transmitters, actually, but a big one in London.
[02:03:40.208 --> 02:03:41.108]  They can have, like, you know...
[02:03:42.265 --> 02:03:43.726]  500,000 watt AMs there.
[02:03:43.746 --> 02:03:50.570]  And I'm on the show, and they take like 20 calls.
[02:03:50.630 --> 02:03:51.811]  Everybody agrees with me.
[02:03:52.592 --> 02:03:57.715]  And one guy calls in, and he goes, I'd love to get you in a jail cell.
[02:03:59.059 --> 02:04:01.200]  I'd love to get you in there.
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:07.302]  Well, actually, the guy's threatening me, saying, yeah, you're a traitor, you're an idiot, you're this and that.
[02:04:07.622 --> 02:04:11.124]  Don't talk about how my queen's German, because I pointed out their royal family isn't even there.
[02:04:12.024 --> 02:04:12.924]  It isn't even British.
[02:04:14.285 --> 02:04:16.466]  And I said, wait a minute, you work for the government, don't you?
[02:04:17.126 --> 02:04:19.587]  He's like, yeah, I'd like to get you, I'd like to get you.
[02:04:19.807 --> 02:04:21.908]  He hadn't even said yet that he was a jail guard.
[02:04:21.948 --> 02:04:23.729]  I go, you're a jail guard, aren't you?
[02:04:24.409 --> 02:04:25.389]  He goes, huh, huh?
[02:04:25.789 --> 02:04:26.590]  I go, yeah, aren't you?
[02:04:26.610 --> 02:04:27.030]  He goes, uh.
[02:04:27.691 --> 02:04:29.272]  Yeah, I'd like to get you in the cell.
[02:04:29.292 --> 02:04:30.693]  I'd like to urinate on you.
[02:04:30.713 --> 02:04:31.613]  He used another word.
[02:04:31.633 --> 02:04:33.914]  I said, oh, oh.
[02:04:33.974 --> 02:04:34.975]  And the host was amazed.
[02:04:34.995 --> 02:04:35.935]  He goes, how did you know that?
[02:04:36.395 --> 02:04:37.316]  Well, I can just tell.
[02:04:37.336 --> 02:04:40.177]  And somebody starts saying, I'd like to get you.
[02:04:40.998 --> 02:04:41.578]  I'd like to get you.
[02:04:41.598 --> 02:04:43.519]  I mean, either this is because I could hear it in the voice.
[02:04:43.839 --> 02:04:45.120]  He'd done this before.
[02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:46.601]  He was into torture.
[02:04:46.661 --> 02:04:47.801]  He was into kidnapping.
[02:04:48.361 --> 02:04:50.302]  Basically, this was a smart kidnapper.
[02:04:51.123 --> 02:04:53.384]  A smart kidnapper goes and becomes a jail guard.
[02:04:54.383 --> 02:04:55.184]  So they don't get in trouble.
[02:04:55.224 --> 02:04:56.405]  They get to enjoy their fun.
[02:04:56.805 --> 02:05:00.809]  So I knew either this guy kidnaps people because of the sound of enjoyment.
[02:05:01.209 --> 02:05:03.872]  I could tell just what second he'd done this before.
[02:05:05.013 --> 02:05:07.755]  He's all, I'd like to get you behind closed doors.
[02:05:07.835 --> 02:05:09.096]  I'd like to, I'd like to.
[02:05:09.116 --> 02:05:10.477]  You could just hear it in his voice.
[02:05:10.578 --> 02:05:12.099]  I was like, whoa, you're a jail guard.
[02:05:12.539 --> 02:05:20.827]  Because statistically, this guy probably didn't have enough nerve to do what he really wanted to do and kidnap and kill women and stuff or whoever else.
[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:23.880]  So I could, you know, split-second analysis.
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:24.421]  I just knew.
[02:05:24.701 --> 02:05:28.021]  My brain went through all these permutations real quick that I can't even explain.
[02:05:28.061 --> 02:05:29.262]  I said, well, you're a jail guard.
[02:05:30.142 --> 02:05:31.622]  And he kind of went, huh?
[02:05:31.642 --> 02:05:32.302]  I said, well, are you?
[02:05:32.362 --> 02:05:36.063]  Well, yeah, and I'd like to get you in the jail cell and urinate on you.
[02:05:37.904 --> 02:05:38.484]  See, I knew.
[02:05:38.504 --> 02:05:43.345]  Either this guy's kidnapped people or he's gotten them in a position of power and likes to do this.
[02:05:44.705 --> 02:05:46.786]  So, see, that's who we're facing here.
[02:05:48.306 --> 02:05:50.007]  And I hope you realize that.
[02:05:50.187 --> 02:05:51.407]  I hope you're awake to that.
[02:05:52.646 --> 02:05:54.147]  I hope you know who we're facing.
[02:05:54.687 --> 02:06:04.850]  If the people that call and disagree with me say, I'm going to kill you, you're a lying communist, or they're a liberal, you're a lying racist, whatever the evil thing in their mind is, I'm in.
[02:06:05.371 --> 02:06:08.872]  Or they call in and say, I'd like to get you behind closed doors.
[02:06:10.936 --> 02:06:13.717]  So, you know, that's basically it, folks.
[02:06:13.817 --> 02:06:16.258]  No thinking person, when they hear the facts, can disagree.
[02:06:16.618 --> 02:06:17.498]  It's all around you.
[02:06:17.778 --> 02:06:24.220]  And they heard patriots like myself and others decades ago warn people about everything that's now happened.
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:26.501]  How government will use terrorism to enslave us.
[02:06:26.981 --> 02:06:29.262]  How they'd put in a cashless society control grid.
[02:06:29.522 --> 02:06:30.882]  How there'd be this new world order.
[02:06:32.223 --> 02:06:33.483]  How they'd do all this to us.
[02:06:33.563 --> 02:06:36.204]  And now it's happened, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[02:06:37.532 --> 02:06:46.059]  So are we going to keep acting like we're in the closet, acting like we're the minority, or are we as freedom lovers going to act like the majority?
[02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:49.141]  All right, let's go ahead.
[02:06:50.322 --> 02:06:54.606]  Let's go ahead and take a couple calls, and then I will get into this news.
[02:06:55.526 --> 02:06:59.069]  I know there's a lot of them, but I can't find my call list here.
[02:06:59.569 --> 02:06:59.970]  There it is.
[02:07:00.672 --> 02:07:02.513]  Let's talk to Michael in Rhode Island.
[02:07:02.533 --> 02:07:06.836]  I guess he's a W-A-L-E 50,000 watt blowtorch listener.
[02:07:07.317 --> 02:07:08.157]  Michael, how you doing?
[02:07:08.457 --> 02:07:09.498]  I'm doing well today, Alex.
[02:07:09.518 --> 02:07:10.138]  How about yourself?
[02:07:10.859 --> 02:07:12.040]  I'm good, and it's good to talk to you.
[02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:12.600]  What's going on?
[02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:16.162]  I've just been reading an article from the New American.
[02:07:16.603 --> 02:07:19.945]  It is put out by the John Birch Society, but I know there are some good people still in there.
[02:07:20.085 --> 02:07:20.345]  Yes.
[02:07:20.926 --> 02:07:23.627]  It's called Why We Fight.
[02:07:23.647 --> 02:07:24.808]  I don't know if you're familiar with that article.
[02:07:25.849 --> 02:07:26.289]  Oh, no.
[02:07:26.649 --> 02:07:27.750]  I haven't been reading it lately.
[02:07:27.810 --> 02:07:28.671]  I just haven't had time.
[02:07:29.391 --> 02:07:30.332]  It's a very good article.
[02:07:31.285 --> 02:07:40.193]  It talks about the document of the world effectively controlled by the UN, by the United Nations, 1962 by Lincoln P. Blumenfeld.
[02:07:41.634 --> 02:07:49.721]  It also talks about the new Pentagon, the Pentagon's new map, essentially an updating of a world effectively controlled by the United Nations.
[02:07:50.188 --> 02:07:53.229]  And it goes into the reasons why we're going to war.
[02:07:53.689 --> 02:07:54.950]  Yeah, I mean, here's the point.
[02:07:55.010 --> 02:07:57.090]  They know Americans won't buy a U.N.
[02:07:57.150 --> 02:08:00.592]  war to take over any sovereign nation, and the U.N.
[02:08:00.612 --> 02:08:03.072]  knows the third world would revolt against them.
[02:08:03.413 --> 02:08:04.913]  They've got to act like the good cops.
[02:08:04.933 --> 02:08:07.214]  So America plays the part of the bad cop.
[02:08:07.914 --> 02:08:17.541]  Our propaganda domestically says it's good and wonderful and we all feel good, while worldwide it's a 180, America's the worst, and then everything American is bad.
[02:08:17.641 --> 02:08:25.106]  See, America's being set up for the fall right now, while the bankers get us to grab all the oil and money and power for them.
[02:08:25.927 --> 02:08:28.849]  Very elaborate scam, and the average person can't understand it.
[02:08:29.449 --> 02:08:32.611]  Yeah, I'd like to read one quick paragraph.
[02:08:32.651 --> 02:08:33.232]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:08:34.212 --> 02:08:34.772]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:08:35.053 --> 02:08:35.293]  Okay.
[02:08:35.473 --> 02:08:43.698]  There's a central concept in a world effectively controlled by the United Nations is that the collective security system it describes must be global, with no exceptions to its fiat.
[02:08:44.159 --> 02:08:45.099]  Universal membership.
[02:08:45.419 --> 02:08:51.163]  Building that order will require treating nations outside of it as aggressors and forcibly assimilating them.
[02:08:51.583 --> 02:08:59.929]  This point is described with stunning candor in a March 2003 Esquire magazine article by Thomas Barnett, a Pentagon specialist in strategic futures.
[02:08:59.969 --> 02:09:01.490]  Barnett's essay, The Pentagon's New Map,
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.161]  It's essentially an updating of a world effectively controlled by the United Nations.
[02:09:05.801 --> 02:09:07.001]  So you see here, aggressors.
[02:09:07.161 --> 02:09:08.762]  We hear that all over the news now, Alex.
[02:09:09.302 --> 02:09:10.242]  These aggressor nations.
[02:09:10.562 --> 02:09:13.123]  And it's always some country that takes Serbia.
[02:09:13.163 --> 02:09:14.844]  They had Al-Qaeda attacking them.
[02:09:15.724 --> 02:09:17.865]  Bin Laden commanding CIA forces.
[02:09:17.885 --> 02:09:19.705]  This is a Senate report by Republicans.
[02:09:20.125 --> 02:09:29.768]  In 99, Bin Laden savagely attacking the Serbs, blowing up school buses, targeting sub-schools, knowing primitively the Serbs would go into a mad howl if their kids were being killed.
[02:09:30.468 --> 02:09:31.989]  So the Serbs struck back.
[02:09:32.429 --> 02:09:33.310]  Then they're demonized.
[02:09:33.330 --> 02:09:34.491]  The invasion takes place.
[02:09:34.531 --> 02:09:36.852]  The mass takeover and now deindustrialization.
[02:09:37.152 --> 02:09:38.513]  Another sovereign country falls.
[02:09:39.073 --> 02:09:40.934]  It's more elaborate with places like Iraq.
[02:09:40.954 --> 02:09:42.355]  You've got a CIA government.
[02:09:42.755 --> 02:09:45.897]  It follows its orders to attack Iran, to go against the Kurds.
[02:09:45.917 --> 02:09:50.000]  It follows their orders publicly to attack Kuwait.
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:51.200]  Saddam doesn't know what to do.
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:52.861]  His masters have turned on him.
[02:09:53.302 --> 02:09:53.922]  He's invaded.
[02:09:53.962 --> 02:09:55.183]  He's bombed for 12 years.
[02:09:55.463 --> 02:09:57.004]  He's not given an amnesty deal.
[02:09:57.954 --> 02:09:59.977]  When he finally is offered it, he takes it.
[02:09:59.997 --> 02:10:01.339]  They refuse it publicly.
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:03.442]  The average person never hears anything.
[02:10:03.482 --> 02:10:04.383]  The attack begins.
[02:10:04.744 --> 02:10:05.605]  Run into some trouble.
[02:10:05.885 --> 02:10:08.168]  They go ahead and give Saddam the amnesty deal.
[02:10:08.208 --> 02:10:09.310]  The evidence shows.
[02:10:09.330 --> 02:10:09.931]  We're not sure.
[02:10:09.951 --> 02:10:12.394]  They may still grab a double and trot him out.
[02:10:12.414 --> 02:10:14.317]  Fly Saddam to Russia.
[02:10:15.269 --> 02:10:22.256]  Russia, of course, is working with the globalists, the KGB chief working with the CIA chief Bush to stage this event.
[02:10:22.697 --> 02:10:30.625]  And now Pearl was at a White House dinner, said they're going to be attacking North Korea, said they're going to be attacking Iran and Syria, bragged.
[02:10:31.411 --> 02:10:33.652]  Strutted around, laughing at everyone.
[02:10:35.073 --> 02:10:38.594]  They're now saying that, oh, Iran has violated its U.N.
[02:10:38.654 --> 02:10:39.535]  weapons deal.
[02:10:40.035 --> 02:10:41.095]  Syria's done it.
[02:10:41.396 --> 02:10:42.576]  Saddam's in Syria.
[02:10:42.616 --> 02:10:45.838]  The invasion will begin as they mass the troops.
[02:10:45.898 --> 02:10:47.078]  I mean, it's happening right now.
[02:10:47.998 --> 02:10:50.920]  Here at home, total enslavement, Michael.
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:54.381]  Oh, yeah, and it's like I'm trying to resist the best I can.
[02:10:54.541 --> 02:10:55.742]  I told you about that shirt I made.
[02:10:56.528 --> 02:11:00.631]  And I was talking to my uncle about it at a steak fry this weekend at my dad's garage.
[02:11:01.071 --> 02:11:01.992]  A steak fry?
[02:11:02.032 --> 02:11:02.692]  That sounds good.
[02:11:02.832 --> 02:11:04.113]  Yeah, just a little get-together.
[02:11:04.213 --> 02:11:05.254]  What is a steak fry?
[02:11:06.374 --> 02:11:07.455]  They get together, they have beers.
[02:11:07.515 --> 02:11:09.957]  I don't drink because I don't believe in that mind.
[02:11:09.977 --> 02:11:11.718]  But you fry steaks up there, too.
[02:11:12.498 --> 02:11:13.639]  Yeah.
[02:11:13.679 --> 02:11:17.902]  We love, like Ted Nugent says, we love to barbecue that beef on the grill, you know?
[02:11:18.462 --> 02:11:20.524]  Oh, by steak fry, you're cooking it on the grill.
[02:11:20.604 --> 02:11:20.804]  Yeah.
[02:11:21.525 --> 02:11:23.066]  I thought you meant frying steaks.
[02:11:23.386 --> 02:11:24.266]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:11:24.306 --> 02:11:25.567]  No, we do that down here, sir.
[02:11:25.787 --> 02:11:26.007]  Yeah.
[02:11:26.267 --> 02:11:28.628]  We need as much cholesterol as possible.
[02:11:28.708 --> 02:11:29.089]  That's right.
[02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:30.489]  Start talking about chicken fried steaks.
[02:11:30.509 --> 02:11:31.850]  I'm going to have to leave the airwaves here.
[02:11:33.731 --> 02:11:44.836]  But anyway, I was talking to him, and he goes, he saw my shirt and said, he goes, you know, what you're saying is true, Michael, and I can prove conclusively that 400 families run this country.
[02:11:45.396 --> 02:11:47.237]  But he said, but we have freedom in this country.
[02:11:47.257 --> 02:11:49.538]  You know, we have the right to do this and have to drink beer and,
[02:11:49.918 --> 02:11:51.380]  No, actually, that's not freedom.
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:56.105]  Yeah, I heard this bimbo on a local radio station.
[02:11:56.125 --> 02:11:59.088]  She goes, hey, everybody, it's whatever her name is.
[02:11:59.388 --> 02:12:01.090]  I tell you, I just support the troops.
[02:12:01.130 --> 02:12:02.932]  I hope they get after all those countries.
[02:12:03.132 --> 02:12:04.053]  This is so great.
[02:12:04.113 --> 02:12:10.480]  Until they've all gotten their memo, it's admitted that this biggest radio owner out there sent a memo out saying to say this.
[02:12:11.129 --> 02:12:14.493]  You know, I just want to say that I can drink my Corona by the pool because of the troops.
[02:12:14.754 --> 02:12:15.955]  I can go shopping.
[02:12:16.576 --> 02:12:17.036]  Kill them.
[02:12:17.097 --> 02:12:17.837]  Just kill them.
[02:12:18.078 --> 02:12:18.799]  Just kill them.
[02:12:18.879 --> 02:12:20.741]  Hey, here's your favorite group.
[02:12:20.761 --> 02:12:22.083]  I mean, it's just, whoa.
[02:12:22.503 --> 02:12:26.348]  A mindless idiot saying, kill them, kill them, kill them, so I can shop.
[02:12:26.688 --> 02:12:29.552]  Hey, lady, you're not going to be able to shop when they're down with you.
[02:12:29.572 --> 02:12:30.093]  Don't worry.
[02:12:30.493 --> 02:12:31.794]  That's what I deal with.
[02:12:31.854 --> 02:12:34.294]  It is frustrating, but I still keep fighting, you know?
[02:12:34.795 --> 02:12:35.875]  So he's like, yeah, it's true.
[02:12:35.895 --> 02:12:36.655]  They all run it.
[02:12:36.795 --> 02:12:38.156]  Boy, you can drink that cold beer.
[02:12:38.176 --> 02:12:39.236]  That's exactly what he said to me.
[02:12:39.296 --> 02:12:39.856]  I was shocked.
[02:12:40.157 --> 02:12:41.077]  Oh, I've heard him.
[02:12:41.117 --> 02:12:41.897]  No, I've heard him.
[02:12:41.957 --> 02:12:45.579]  I can go, I can still go to a ball game, eat a hot dog.
[02:12:46.199 --> 02:12:49.160]  Yeah, but you can't drive down the street without showing your papers.
[02:12:50.217 --> 02:12:52.039]  Well, you know, funds have changed.
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:54.261]  We've got to give our rights up.
[02:12:54.802 --> 02:12:55.963]  But America is rights.
[02:12:56.083 --> 02:12:57.264]  Well, there ain't no more.
[02:12:57.284 --> 02:12:58.605]  That's what I hear down here.
[02:12:59.106 --> 02:12:59.886]  You go, well, wait a minute.
[02:12:59.906 --> 02:13:00.887]  The border's wide open.
[02:13:00.927 --> 02:13:02.309]  Well, I've got to go.
[02:13:02.329 --> 02:13:03.430]  I don't want to talk about it.
[02:13:04.731 --> 02:13:07.654]  Point is, the border's wide open, but we're going to lose our rights.
[02:13:07.754 --> 02:13:08.554]  It's a joke.
[02:13:09.095 --> 02:13:09.716]  Thanks for the call.
[02:13:09.776 --> 02:13:11.397]  I'll cover news, and we'll go to Spencer and others.
[02:13:11.477 --> 02:13:11.978]  Stay with me.
[02:13:16.340 --> 02:13:20.822]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:13:21.162 --> 02:13:25.264]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:13:25.544 --> 02:13:26.104]  We listened.
[02:13:26.404 --> 02:13:31.386]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:13:31.666 --> 02:13:32.147]  We listened.
[02:13:32.527 --> 02:13:35.568]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:13:35.988 --> 02:13:36.548]  We listened.
[02:13:37.009 --> 02:13:40.170]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.970]  We're good to go.
[02:14:10.189 --> 02:14:18.651]  You are what you eat, and that's why people are turning to nutritional supplements.
[02:14:18.991 --> 02:14:21.552]  The question is, what is the quality of those supplements?
[02:14:22.092 --> 02:14:25.693]  One company, Verified Quality, has actually set the standards in the industry.
[02:14:25.913 --> 02:14:31.754]  In fact, most other supplement companies couldn't even come close to the quality controls that are required by the folks at Verified Quality.
[02:14:32.194 --> 02:14:32.794]  We're good to go.
[02:14:50.442 --> 02:14:52.043]  Take another look at that pill you're about to swallow.
[02:14:52.063 --> 02:14:53.823]  Do you really know how it was made or what's really in it?
[02:14:53.843 --> 02:14:54.783]  Visit verifiedquality.com or call 1-800-797-3697.
[02:14:54.823 --> 02:14:55.044]  That's 1-800-797-3697.
[02:14:55.084 --> 02:14:56.464]  Verified quality is verified quality.
[02:14:56.484 --> 02:14:58.685]  Hi, Jack Browner with Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:20.884]  Remember that ad from October of 2000?
[02:15:20.944 --> 02:15:23.852]  The NASDAQ was down 22% for the year?
[02:15:24.273 --> 02:15:25.636]  Well, it's since gone down another 40%.
[02:15:25.717 --> 02:15:27.943]  Folks, where will it bottom out?
[02:15:28.539 --> 02:15:28.979]  We're good to go.
[02:15:28.999 --> 02:15:29.159]  I think?
[02:15:53.232 --> 02:15:54.152]  Call Midas today.
[02:15:54.172 --> 02:15:55.033]  800-686-2237.
[02:15:57.353 --> 02:15:59.594]  Collector coins are liquid, private, and portable.
[02:15:59.854 --> 02:16:02.495]  Downside risk is minimal in comparison to paper equities.
[02:16:02.835 --> 02:16:07.777]  The time to move to hard assets is now before the momentum buyers further escalate the prices.
[02:16:08.017 --> 02:16:09.357]  Protect your financial holdings.
[02:16:09.638 --> 02:16:11.078]  Call Midas Resources today.
[02:16:11.098 --> 02:16:11.138]  800-686-2237.
[02:16:14.445 --> 02:16:15.846]  The two most important protein superfoods known.
[02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:38.361]  We're good to go.
[02:16:56.406 --> 02:17:00.609]  Listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley Sunday evenings at 6 p.m.
[02:17:00.649 --> 02:17:02.031]  Central, 7 Eastern.
[02:17:02.251 --> 02:17:11.019]  Call 1-888-826-4448 to learn more or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[02:17:11.199 --> 02:17:13.782]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[02:17:18.050 --> 02:17:18.570]  Don't worry.
[02:17:19.011 --> 02:17:20.552]  This show is documented.
[02:17:21.052 --> 02:17:23.854]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:24.254 --> 02:17:29.498]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:30.558 --> 02:17:31.279]  Welcome back.
[02:17:31.399 --> 02:17:32.580]  Thank you for joining me.
[02:17:34.281 --> 02:17:36.603]  The calls are coming up a little bit later in this hour.
[02:17:36.783 --> 02:17:38.064]  The number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:43.468 --> 02:17:52.610]  And jumping back into some of the news, I want to get into this 9-1-1 Whitewash Committee 3 that they've got running.
[02:17:52.670 --> 02:17:54.830]  Don't forget to be able to have a job anywhere.
[02:17:54.850 --> 02:17:58.591]  You'll have to have clearance from Homeland Security, have special employment cards.
[02:17:58.631 --> 02:18:00.291]  It's all for everyone's security and safety.
[02:18:01.751 --> 02:18:10.113]  I mentioned this earlier, but let me cover it now, and then I'll get into some of the profiteering from the war news and some other little key tidbits that you don't want to miss.
[02:18:11.261 --> 02:18:16.964]  Visitors face scanner database as they enter Pinellas Courthouse.
[02:18:16.984 --> 02:18:17.904]  This is in Florida.
[02:18:19.325 --> 02:18:19.926]  Clearwater.
[02:18:20.906 --> 02:18:21.666]  Tampa Tribune.
[02:18:22.227 --> 02:18:28.330]  Face scanning technology that can identify wanted criminals made its official debut visiting Pinellas County's criminal courthouse.
[02:18:29.891 --> 02:18:30.391]  And, uh...
[02:18:31.309 --> 02:18:34.210]  By the way, they're going to put in this, of course, databases.
[02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:38.532]  They have all these different terror databases from local police, the ADL.
[02:18:39.132 --> 02:18:41.493]  They list Kiwanis Club, NRA.
[02:18:41.673 --> 02:18:44.194]  Basically, any organization is terrorist.
[02:18:44.875 --> 02:18:46.756]  Those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[02:18:46.796 --> 02:18:47.696]  Constitution.
[02:18:49.997 --> 02:18:54.819]  You've heard about how in big cities like Denver, they surveil everybody.
[02:18:56.119 --> 02:18:58.020]  The Army does, or the local police.
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:18:59.541]  Well, this all goes in the database.
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:05.182]  And it says it is the first such use of scanning technology at a courthouse.
[02:19:05.222 --> 02:19:06.103]  That's not true.
[02:19:06.343 --> 02:19:09.365]  Every time they put it in town, it's like, we're very proud of it.
[02:19:09.385 --> 02:19:11.106]  We're the first to have cholera here.
[02:19:11.726 --> 02:19:13.487]  We're the first to have herpes here.
[02:19:13.507 --> 02:19:21.552]  You know, it's like some horrible thing, but it's always, we were the first to have dealt with the Forrest Covertly lease buildings and blow them up and terrorize the city.
[02:19:21.752 --> 02:19:22.573]  Well, no, you weren't.
[02:19:23.874 --> 02:19:29.217]  It is the first such use of scanning technology at the courthouse, according to a security expert.
[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:32.121]  On hand to observe how the system works.
[02:19:33.681 --> 02:19:35.542]  Oh, there was just a security expert on hand.
[02:19:35.582 --> 02:19:41.503]  This is the stuff of the future, said Henry Dreyfus, a consultant to the Department of Defense.
[02:19:42.884 --> 02:19:47.125]  Oh, he just dropped by.
[02:19:47.425 --> 02:19:52.786]  A $55,000 scanning system consists of two camera towers linked to personal computers operated by bailiffs.
[02:19:53.767 --> 02:19:58.068]  And it goes on to say how there's a profile and a matching and...
[02:19:59.191 --> 02:20:01.352]  Oh, it's so good.
[02:20:02.372 --> 02:20:06.193]  As they let the prisoners, as the cattle, let them know who owns them.
[02:20:10.074 --> 02:20:19.396]  And to have a job in agriculture, in transportation, in communications, anywhere, you will be able to get that job federally.
[02:20:20.294 --> 02:20:24.595]  Now, if you're not screened, a bad credit could stop you from having any job.
[02:20:24.655 --> 02:20:33.017]  And notice they've been sending for decades all the 17-year-old kids out of high school a credit card every week, wanting to get you into the new debtor prison.
[02:20:33.357 --> 02:20:34.877]  Won't be able to get a job now.
[02:20:35.177 --> 02:20:37.558]  You'll all be in a new class of criminals, and they want that.
[02:20:37.898 --> 02:20:38.638]  They want that.
[02:20:39.498 --> 02:20:42.379]  If they can't show you on welfare, they'll get you into the criminal justice system.
[02:20:42.619 --> 02:20:45.460]  If they can't do that, you got bad credit, no job, no nothing.
[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:46.080]  Anywhere.
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:46.560]  Anywhere.
[02:20:48.599 --> 02:20:58.086]  Don't worry, they're going to build sectors of cities where the homeless will work in federal retraining jobs, where you'll have a federal housing, whole classes who never wanted to live in federal housing.
[02:20:58.506 --> 02:21:00.127]  But it won't matter, you will.
[02:21:00.147 --> 02:21:01.669]  You will.
[02:21:01.989 --> 02:21:07.052]  They're having federal zoning now, where you won't be able to have all the family living together in a house.
[02:21:07.973 --> 02:21:11.756]  Unless you're an illegal alien grouping, and then that'll be allowed.
[02:21:14.218 --> 02:21:17.320]  This is the new system!
[02:21:18.211 --> 02:21:21.932]  And we're only a few years away from full integration.
[02:21:22.913 --> 02:21:24.693]  Full integration into it.
[02:21:25.614 --> 02:21:35.998]  They practiced it on the black people in the inner cities, and as Tony Brown said, now it's for all of you, but much, much worse.
[02:21:38.199 --> 02:21:40.259]  Ha, ha, ha, it's so good.
[02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:44.701]  GAO criticizes system for tracking terrorists.
[02:21:45.342 --> 02:21:47.944]  Watch lists are called incompatible.
[02:21:48.004 --> 02:21:51.266]  It's not bad that you'll all be tracked and traced.
[02:21:53.707 --> 02:21:56.469]  It's bad that it doesn't work very well.
[02:21:56.509 --> 02:21:57.769]  It's like the ballistics testing.
[02:21:58.090 --> 02:22:00.351]  Oh, we've got to get the ballistics testing for the gun registration.
[02:22:00.371 --> 02:22:01.251]  A little better, then we'll do it.
[02:22:01.572 --> 02:22:02.392]  Oh, the face scanning.
[02:22:02.412 --> 02:22:03.733]  A little better, and it'll go in everywhere.
[02:22:04.493 --> 02:22:05.654]  Right now, it's just thumb printing.
[02:22:06.408 --> 02:22:17.157]  More than 19 months after the September 11, 2000 attacks, the federal government's system of keeping track of suspected terrorists remains disorganized and inefficient, according to a congressional study released today.
[02:22:17.197 --> 02:22:21.541]  The report by General Accounting Office found that a dozen terrorist watch lists
[02:22:23.334 --> 02:22:32.280]  ...compiled by non-federal agencies are frequently incompatible with one another, containing different pieces of information, and frequently set up so they cannot be merged or compared easily.
[02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:40.025]  Well, that's because, again, it's the ADL and Southern Poverty and others listing almost any gun group, any conservative group, any land rights group.
[02:22:41.185 --> 02:22:45.788]  So the Army will list any liberal group, because you can't get conservative Army guys that list the conservatives.
[02:22:46.169 --> 02:22:49.771]  So they list all the liberals as terrorists, and then we're all in the database, and...
[02:22:50.868 --> 02:22:53.231]  Ridge says no job if you're in the database.
[02:22:54.172 --> 02:22:55.473]  They got a bill right here in Texas.
[02:22:55.553 --> 02:22:59.618]  If you've ever, quote, criticized the police, you'll be in a database and they pull you over.
[02:22:59.638 --> 02:23:03.382]  The commissar, the political police.
[02:23:05.424 --> 02:23:06.325]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.806 --> 02:23:08.428]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.329 --> 02:23:12.032]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:17.046 --> 02:23:20.707]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[02:23:20.827 --> 02:23:25.228]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:23:25.428 --> 02:23:26.748]  The Aeronizer.
[02:23:26.768 --> 02:23:32.070]  3-44-38, and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:23:32.090 --> 02:23:32.610]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:33.510]  Protect your family.
[02:23:37.471 --> 02:23:42.632]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:43.292 --> 02:23:45.593]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:23:47.863 --> 02:23:54.745]  You've got to have standards in your life that you cannot compromise on.
[02:23:54.765 --> 02:23:57.206]  You've got to have principle.
[02:23:59.666 --> 02:24:16.111]  I mean, if we had principle in this country that we wanted service and we wanted good behavior from our government and we wanted to be respected, and if we stood up on those principles and got angry about it, we wouldn't be in this position right now
[02:24:16.906 --> 02:24:24.635]  But incrementally we became trusting, and now the roles are reversed.
[02:24:25.495 --> 02:24:26.737]  New word, the revolves.
[02:24:27.498 --> 02:24:33.844]  Now the roles are reversed, and government is telling us that it's the boss and we're the slave.
[02:24:33.905 --> 02:24:36.928]  But they're adding the caveat, for your safety.
[02:24:39.250 --> 02:24:41.191]  Oh, we're doing this for your safety.
[02:24:41.531 --> 02:24:44.652]  Spencer in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:24:44.692 --> 02:24:45.153]  Go ahead.
[02:24:45.553 --> 02:24:46.593]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:24:46.713 --> 02:24:55.777]  It is wrong to compromise if it means sacrificing principle, and under the Monroe Doctrine we had principle, but we don't have that under the Brzezinski Doctrine.
[02:24:57.478 --> 02:25:03.140]  And for those who don't know, Zbigniew Brzezinski called for a giant terrorist attack on the U.S.
[02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:07.442]  to be needed so they can invade and take over the world for a new world order.
[02:25:08.533 --> 02:25:21.542]  Yes, sir, and I'm calling you today because my local FM talk station has banned me from asking any questions concerning the Warren Commission because they say it was 40 years ago and it's so full of holes that they deny its even existence.
[02:25:23.463 --> 02:25:28.627]  And it was all a big television drama, like when Ruby shot Oswald.
[02:25:29.767 --> 02:25:35.111]  Well, anybody who believes that Oswald acted alone, fine, I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[02:25:36.212 --> 02:25:36.572]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:37.071 --> 02:25:42.354]  And there's a lot of exhibits that's in those 26 volumes that are quite interesting 40 years later.
[02:25:42.594 --> 02:25:48.017]  For instance, the one that said that JFK was going to crack down on the oil barons, including H.L.
[02:25:48.038 --> 02:25:50.319]  Hunt, J. Paul Getty, and the other Texas oil men.
[02:25:50.339 --> 02:25:51.600]  Well, it was more than that.
[02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:57.603]  I mean, they were certainly around and involved in it from the eyewitnesses we've had on, but he was going to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[02:25:57.803 --> 02:25:59.544]  He'd already signed that executive order.
[02:25:59.564 --> 02:26:02.286]  He was getting rid of the CIA and getting us out of Vietnam.
[02:26:03.465 --> 02:26:04.405]  And do you know why?
[02:26:04.425 --> 02:26:05.626]  He'd been a hawk.
[02:26:05.686 --> 02:26:07.386]  He was a war hero.
[02:26:07.966 --> 02:26:22.129]  He saw combat, was injured very badly, had bad injuries on a lot of medications just because of his back being partially broken, being hit by the Japanese ship when he was in his little torpedo boat.
[02:26:23.210 --> 02:26:24.410]  He was all pro-war.
[02:26:24.570 --> 02:26:29.411]  Expanded military spending, cut taxes, really had more of a conservative attitude.
[02:26:29.964 --> 02:26:33.525]  A fiscal system that was working quite well was all pro-war.
[02:26:33.665 --> 02:26:40.266]  And then suddenly, they brought Northwoods to him in 62 and said, let's hijack jet airliners and crash them.
[02:26:40.706 --> 02:26:41.686]  Let's bomb D.C.
[02:26:41.706 --> 02:26:44.807]  Let's commit sniper attacks and blame it on foreign enemies for war.
[02:26:45.387 --> 02:26:47.447]  Kennedy said, you people are nuts.
[02:26:48.047 --> 02:26:49.107]  I'm abolishing you.
[02:26:49.147 --> 02:26:51.708]  And they said, no, we're going to abolish you.
[02:26:51.768 --> 02:26:52.808]  And didn't that happen, Spencer?
[02:26:53.488 --> 02:26:58.229]  Yeah, and if we hadn't have believed in that moon landing or the Mercury Project, excuse me...
[02:26:58.977 --> 02:27:00.737]  They could have used it on us back then.
[02:27:02.438 --> 02:27:05.078]  Of course, we believed in the Mercury Project.
[02:27:06.278 --> 02:27:14.440]  But, you know, did you know Jack Ruby was a John Bircher and that he met with Lamar Hunt on 11-21, the day before the assassination?
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:24.142]  I didn't know that, but I know that there is an Oklahoma family who are begging oil and a bunch of other stuff
[02:27:25.635 --> 02:27:29.997]  We're actually involved in the founding of the John Birch Society, but the John Birch Society overall is good.
[02:27:30.657 --> 02:27:36.720]  Certainly early on, not the Birchers, but other conservative groups have been used by the bankers.
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:45.043]  They'll tell some good conservative military man, that guy's a communist, go take him out, and they'll go do it and later take him out for plausible deniability.
[02:27:45.363 --> 02:27:49.205]  You know, so many of our troops over there in Iraq now really are risking their lives and living in a
[02:27:49.969 --> 02:27:55.593]  Third World cesspool bombed out Stone Age system because they really believe in this country.
[02:27:56.153 --> 02:27:56.893]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:56.994 --> 02:27:58.615]  But it is evil.
[02:27:58.675 --> 02:27:59.895]  Does that mean the troops are evil?
[02:27:59.955 --> 02:28:00.976]  No, it means they're ignorant.
[02:28:00.996 --> 02:28:01.937]  Thanks for the call, Spencer.
[02:28:03.077 --> 02:28:03.838]  I appreciate the call.
[02:28:03.858 --> 02:28:05.679]  Yeah, I should have gotten into that.
[02:28:05.959 --> 02:28:15.706]  Man, I had an article, a big mainstream article on that family and how they funded the John Birchers and all the different things they do and how they are big supporters of Bush.
[02:28:15.806 --> 02:28:17.767]  I need to dig that back up and cover that.
[02:28:18.773 --> 02:28:21.395]  Let's go ahead now, and who's up next, Mark?
[02:28:24.237 --> 02:28:24.517]  Really?
[02:28:25.938 --> 02:28:26.358]  Oh, great.
[02:28:26.478 --> 02:28:29.340]  Okay, well, what I'll do is I'm going to go to calls here in a few minutes.
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:36.965]  We'll go to the folks in Georgia and others here in just a moment, and if you want to join us on air, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:28:37.565 --> 02:28:44.510]  I'm down here in Texas, and they're up there in Minnesota with the satellite uplinks and the boards and all that.
[02:28:45.862 --> 02:28:55.451]  They gave me a computer and offered to type the names in studio, but I never hooked it up and used it because I found that when I have a computer on in studio, it becomes a distraction.
[02:28:56.232 --> 02:28:59.895]  I'll start surfing the net instead of covering the news and talking to the folks.
[02:29:00.456 --> 02:29:04.119]  But we will take some calls before this hour ends at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:09.907 --> 02:29:11.888]  Continuing with the news, look at this.
[02:29:11.928 --> 02:29:14.450]  This is out of Newsmax.
[02:29:14.670 --> 02:29:16.992]  Is Saddam hiding in Syria?
[02:29:18.653 --> 02:29:27.158]  And this was filed out of Macedonia, there in northern Greece.
[02:29:28.159 --> 02:29:33.122]  Is Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein hiding in Syria?
[02:29:33.835 --> 02:29:39.719]  Debka File, an Israeli-owned rumor mill, boy, you said it right, thinks so.
[02:29:39.739 --> 02:29:49.066]  He is supposed to be in the Mediterranean coast town of Latika in the Cote d'Honor de Cham Resort.
[02:29:50.387 --> 02:29:55.432]  A report of the Al-Assids, the indigenous dynastic rulers.
[02:29:55.572 --> 02:30:04.120]  If so, allowing him entry would be only the latest in a series of manifestly anti-American moves by the Syrian regime.
[02:30:05.521 --> 02:30:09.685]  Anybody that believes that is crazy.
[02:30:12.027 --> 02:30:16.271]  Anybody who believes that they would take Saddam Hussein is nuts.
[02:30:19.003 --> 02:30:22.927]  And now they're saying that Iran isn't following orders.
[02:30:23.747 --> 02:30:33.596]  They're saying Iran has violated some UN rule, so they need to be attacked, and more of our troops are arriving and massing, and I have family in the military.
[02:30:33.616 --> 02:30:35.798]  They've been told next two years.
[02:30:36.459 --> 02:30:40.282]  There was a report last week, the Rumsfeld secret document by the defense secretary got released.
[02:30:40.542 --> 02:30:43.585]  They said they're going to start bombing North Korea in October of this year.
[02:30:44.989 --> 02:30:49.710]  And then Rumsfeld was on the board of ABB that gave the nukes to North Korea.
[02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.930]  Never forget that.
[02:30:53.551 --> 02:30:55.891]  I want to cover this hypocrisy in apple pie in a second.
[02:30:55.931 --> 02:31:00.192]  It's really scary with Richard Pearl, who they call the Prince of Darkness.
[02:31:01.192 --> 02:31:06.773]  But right now, let's go to a caller in Georgia.
[02:31:07.593 --> 02:31:08.634]  Caller, what's your name?
[02:31:09.874 --> 02:31:11.054]  Hey, Alex, my name is Nick.
[02:31:11.559 --> 02:31:13.461]  I was in the military for about 22 years.
[02:31:14.141 --> 02:31:17.004]  Just a little information about Saddam Hussein.
[02:31:17.524 --> 02:31:26.151]  On the 14th of this past month, the Gulf News out of Dubai and the Iranian News Service both reported that the U.S.
[02:31:26.192 --> 02:31:32.477]  had reached an agreement with Russia for $5 billion in cash and credit to get Saddam and 100 of his closest followers out.
[02:31:34.345 --> 02:31:35.766]  Sounds about right.
[02:31:35.786 --> 02:31:37.467]  I did read those reports.
[02:31:37.507 --> 02:31:39.388]  It did show up in the British news.
[02:31:39.408 --> 02:31:40.248]  That's what I was saying, is that...
[02:31:53.780 --> 02:32:02.902]  Saddam and 100 of his closest people, the folks they're catching were on the outs or were, except for Aziz, but that shows at that stage.
[02:32:03.262 --> 02:32:06.323]  Let me go over this calmly because it's got a lot of important facets.
[02:32:07.983 --> 02:32:09.503]  Saddam was CIA.
[02:32:10.764 --> 02:32:14.404]  1958, hired as a hitman to kill communists in Iraq.
[02:32:14.524 --> 02:32:15.545]  That is an admitted fact.
[02:32:15.625 --> 02:32:16.425]  Our government admits it.
[02:32:17.625 --> 02:32:21.486]  By the late 60s, I got him into the Ba'ath Party, which was pro-U.S.,
[02:32:22.430 --> 02:32:25.092]  By the 70s, 1976, he was in control.
[02:32:25.132 --> 02:32:33.239]  By the 80s, thousands of his troops were being trained in torture, demolition, special forces activities at Fort Benning, Georgia, Fort Bragg, and other areas.
[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:35.221]  In 82, the U.S.
[02:32:35.241 --> 02:32:37.402]  government ordered, i.e.
[02:32:37.943 --> 02:32:45.349]  global government ordered, Saddam to attack Iran to go against the Kurds and others and supply VX and sarin nerve gas to do it.
[02:32:46.872 --> 02:32:48.394]  Then, with U.S.
[02:32:48.535 --> 02:32:51.619]  Ambassador Abel Gillespie, she said, go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[02:32:51.679 --> 02:32:53.542]  We don't get involved in Arab affairs.
[02:32:53.602 --> 02:32:55.846]  We have a defense treaty with you, not with Kuwait.
[02:32:56.487 --> 02:33:01.154]  Five days later, he rolled into Kuwait and was attacked, put into the country, encircled.
[02:33:02.637 --> 02:33:07.718]  Then, 12 years of bombing and sanctions and genocide and a million and a half dead Iraqis.
[02:33:08.119 --> 02:33:10.419]  They set up their police state here.
[02:33:10.539 --> 02:33:29.665]  They were now ready to move on to the next phase of the New World Order, World War IV, as former CIA chief calls it, James Woolsey, the war for, quote, the New World Order, according to CNN News in a speech he gave, and we caught that weeks before they reported it here in Austin at UT at a CFR meeting titled The New World Order.
[02:33:30.125 --> 02:33:31.165]  And we aired those clips here.
[02:33:32.609 --> 02:33:34.370]  So, they offer him this amnesty.
[02:33:35.410 --> 02:33:37.631]  He says, I'll accept to go to Egypt.
[02:33:37.872 --> 02:33:39.913]  They withdraw the amnesty.
[02:33:40.013 --> 02:33:41.613]  Bush says he will not accept the amnesty.
[02:33:41.993 --> 02:33:42.934]  They start attacking.
[02:33:42.954 --> 02:33:44.275]  I think they were going to go ahead and kill him.
[02:33:44.815 --> 02:33:45.735]  People fought back.
[02:33:46.015 --> 02:33:49.257]  They got some casualties, so they held back for three days.
[02:33:50.134 --> 02:33:53.437]  Jets take off from Tikrit, Saddam's hometown, into Russia.
[02:33:53.877 --> 02:33:55.979]  Suddenly, all opposition collapses.
[02:33:56.319 --> 02:34:03.526]  Our government now admits they paid in gold bars with SAS, British, and Delta Force, U.S.
[02:34:03.546 --> 02:34:07.129]  Delta Force, paid them in gold bars, just like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
[02:34:09.238 --> 02:34:10.138]  They pay them.
[02:34:10.618 --> 02:34:11.859]  The whole thing falls apart.
[02:34:11.879 --> 02:34:12.779]  They grab the country.
[02:34:12.799 --> 02:34:17.020]  And the same thing was done in Afghanistan, except most of the Taliban and al-Qaeda were CIA.
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:23.622]  They were told to press gang 15-, 20-year-old people, put them in front lines for something for our troops to shoot and bomb.
[02:34:24.582 --> 02:34:28.163]  The CIA controlled now 8,000 Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.
[02:34:28.883 --> 02:34:32.644]  Them were loaded on C-130s, flown out, paid in gold again.
[02:34:33.738 --> 02:34:42.182]  This is previously into Pakistan to start the next phase, attacking India, so Carlaw Group can sell weapons to both sides, Pakistan and India.
[02:34:42.602 --> 02:34:44.863]  So it's the same MO over and over again.
[02:34:44.883 --> 02:34:47.184]  And we look at who have they caught.
[02:34:47.304 --> 02:34:52.306]  Two of Saddam's half-brothers, who he had suspended death sentences on, who were on house arrest.
[02:34:52.967 --> 02:34:54.547]  Low-level minion nobodies.
[02:34:54.968 --> 02:34:57.289]  And they go, let me just finish.
[02:34:57.309 --> 02:34:57.889]  I'll let you talk.
[02:34:58.469 --> 02:34:59.650]  This is a great point you brought up.
[02:35:00.430 --> 02:35:02.291]  Then they go, okay, we caught Aziz.
[02:35:03.194 --> 02:35:04.795]  Well, Aziz is Catholic.
[02:35:04.875 --> 02:35:06.737]  Aziz basically works for the Vatican.
[02:35:07.297 --> 02:35:09.959]  Aziz has always been in the U.S.
[02:35:10.039 --> 02:35:18.745]  Larry King, the rest of it, is a known double agent, was the architect, the man behind Saddam, the real boss of Iraq, even before Saddam came to power.
[02:35:19.245 --> 02:35:20.406]  He is CIA.
[02:35:20.646 --> 02:35:22.968]  And guess where Aziz has to go for life now?
[02:35:23.948 --> 02:35:28.932]  It has been reported that he will get several million pounds a year in his pension.
[02:35:29.648 --> 02:35:39.011]  He is to retire in one of Prince Charles' palaces on Monday and one of Prince Charles' palaces on 144,000 acres.
[02:35:39.311 --> 02:35:40.592]  He will have bodyguards.
[02:35:40.872 --> 02:35:41.952]  He will go shopping.
[02:35:42.212 --> 02:35:43.353]  He will jet set.
[02:35:43.913 --> 02:35:49.655]  Now, that's... And in return, he's going to say Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
[02:35:49.695 --> 02:35:50.135]  Go ahead.
[02:35:50.155 --> 02:35:52.816]  I agree totally with you.
[02:35:52.856 --> 02:35:54.837]  I was in the military long enough to see a lot of this.
[02:35:55.417 --> 02:35:57.318]  And it's continual.
[02:35:58.379 --> 02:36:02.402]  The fact is, if they move them, who would expect Saddam to be on this side of the earth?
[02:36:05.103 --> 02:36:08.866]  Well, it's like Klaus Barbie and Joseph Mingala.
[02:36:09.966 --> 02:36:10.327]  Oh, yeah.
[02:36:10.527 --> 02:36:11.948]  I mean, he's Uruguay, Paraguay.
[02:36:11.968 --> 02:36:16.871]  I mean, I went to work in West Texas and New Mexico, and he said in some towns there were more Nazis.
[02:36:17.551 --> 02:36:19.632]  He'd walk up and see a famous Nazi general.
[02:36:20.813 --> 02:36:25.016]  And they were giving Mingala more kids before he went down to South America.
[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:28.021]  He was involved in some of the radiation stuff out west.
[02:36:28.441 --> 02:36:30.741]  They tell a GI, oh, bring your baby boy in.
[02:36:30.761 --> 02:36:31.841]  We're going to X-ray him.
[02:36:31.901 --> 02:36:33.082]  You've heard about that, haven't you?
[02:36:33.342 --> 02:36:33.582]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:33.602 --> 02:36:34.402]  They defy the kid.
[02:36:34.422 --> 02:36:36.002]  Yeah, they had Nazis running that.
[02:36:36.262 --> 02:36:39.623]  Our rocket systems, our CIA, all Nazi-founded.
[02:36:39.643 --> 02:36:40.463]  Doesn't that sound nice?
[02:36:41.783 --> 02:36:42.024]  Great.
[02:36:42.044 --> 02:36:45.644]  It's kind of like the KGB Homeland Security agency we've got.
[02:36:46.424 --> 02:36:49.325]  Oh, they admit the former head of KGB to help run Homeland Security.
[02:36:49.525 --> 02:36:53.506]  Doesn't that make you want to jump up and just thank Bush for being such a good conservative?
[02:36:55.071 --> 02:36:57.353]  I'm glad I live down in the middle of Georgia, in the middle of nowhere.
[02:36:58.294 --> 02:36:59.455]  Well, absolutely, Mick.
[02:36:59.515 --> 02:37:01.897]  I'm going to stop interrupting you.
[02:37:01.957 --> 02:37:03.139]  Any other points you want to add?
[02:37:05.481 --> 02:37:06.221]  All right, he's gone.
[02:37:06.602 --> 02:37:07.483]  Who's up next, Mark?
[02:37:09.725 --> 02:37:10.746]  All right, I can't hear him.
[02:37:10.786 --> 02:37:11.947]  Somebody in Wisconsin.
[02:37:12.867 --> 02:37:14.469]  Maybe it's me, Alex.
[02:37:14.989 --> 02:37:15.850]  Okay, what's your name?
[02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:16.911]  Hi, it's Linda.
[02:37:17.272 --> 02:37:18.092]  Oh, Linda, how you doing?
[02:37:18.132 --> 02:37:19.053]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:19.073 --> 02:37:19.774]  Good to hear you.
[02:37:21.215 --> 02:37:22.095]  I have two things.
[02:37:22.956 --> 02:37:26.096]  First, let me say something about the John Birch Society.
[02:37:26.116 --> 02:37:29.757]  I was a member when I lived in Utah.
[02:37:29.837 --> 02:37:32.238]  I'm not a member now, but I do get the magazine.
[02:37:33.058 --> 02:37:35.518]  They put out wonderful information.
[02:37:36.478 --> 02:37:40.759]  I was going over some old ones the other day that go back into 1998.
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:43.020]  Here they were telling about...
[02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:57.243]  This threat of the World Trade Towers being bombed, you know, and this is all a connection with Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and on and on and on.
[02:37:57.483 --> 02:37:59.624]  And how the government's going to blame them for it.
[02:38:00.124 --> 02:38:13.267]  But the one thing I want to make clear, and this is for everybody, you know, there's people that say things about Alex Jones and put out information about Alex Jones or John Stattmiller or somebody else.
[02:38:14.495 --> 02:38:16.136]  And this is a ploy.
[02:38:16.237 --> 02:38:22.341]  I remember back in the 50s and 60s, the Communist Party put out a propaganda.
[02:38:22.722 --> 02:38:23.722]  Divide and conquer.
[02:38:23.782 --> 02:38:25.824]  Right, and the same thing with MacArthur.
[02:38:25.964 --> 02:38:31.228]  I even hear conservatives talk about MacArthurism as though that was something evil.
[02:38:31.388 --> 02:38:32.729]  No, he wouldn't do what the U.N.
[02:38:32.750 --> 02:38:33.870]  wanted, so he's bad, yeah.
[02:38:34.031 --> 02:38:35.091]  MacArthur was right.
[02:38:35.191 --> 02:38:37.633]  Okay, the other thing is... Well, McCarthy was right.
[02:38:37.653 --> 02:38:42.357]  The KGB files got released five years ago, and it turned out it was twice as bad than he thought.
[02:38:42.397 --> 02:38:43.558]  But it was okay when he said it was
[02:38:43.678 --> 02:38:44.958]  Hold on, let me say something.
[02:38:45.018 --> 02:38:45.779]  Hold on a second, ma'am.
[02:38:45.919 --> 02:38:46.979]  It was okay, ma'am?
[02:38:47.339 --> 02:38:50.100]  It was okay when he said that it was just communists.
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:58.162]  When he figured out that, he said, wait, the Army runs the communists, our Army's giving them nukes and funding them, boom, he was out of there like that.
[02:38:58.222 --> 02:38:58.622]  Go ahead.
[02:38:59.182 --> 02:39:05.783]  Okay, another thing is we're always going to have infiltrators into our organizations.
[02:39:05.924 --> 02:39:07.664]  I put up with that in Utah, too.
[02:39:08.144 --> 02:39:11.825]  And you can weed them out and find out who they are.
[02:39:12.626 --> 02:39:29.720]  Now, the next item is, I got a call yesterday from a police officer from the Sheriff's Department, and they wanted me to donate money to a cause, which is to teach children in the schools, and one of the things that they were teaching them was about guns.
[02:39:29.740 --> 02:39:31.221]  Yeah, it's gun demonization.
[02:39:31.261 --> 02:39:31.581]  Right.
[02:39:31.962 --> 02:39:38.127]  And I asked him, I said, now, are you teaching them gun safety, or are you teaching them gun control?
[02:39:38.667 --> 02:39:41.529]  I said, why don't you teach them the Constitution?
[02:39:42.169 --> 02:39:44.371]  Ma'am, I got one right here.
[02:39:44.391 --> 02:39:45.131]  Fox News.
[02:39:45.672 --> 02:39:47.793]  Young Marines teach kids discipline and integrity.
[02:39:48.113 --> 02:39:49.634]  You go to the program website.
[02:39:49.995 --> 02:39:51.656]  It's anti-gun programming.
[02:39:51.676 --> 02:39:52.897]  Yep, that's what it is.
[02:39:53.477 --> 02:39:56.439]  Anyway, I told them, I said, I can't support something like that.
[02:39:56.479 --> 02:40:03.904]  I said, unless you teach them the Constitution and what their Second Amendment right is, then I can't support that kind of a program.
[02:40:04.184 --> 02:40:04.704]  Absolutely.
[02:40:04.744 --> 02:40:05.525]  Great to hear from you.
[02:40:06.332 --> 02:40:06.953]  Really good point.
[02:40:06.973 --> 02:40:11.256]  You know, I think that the New American Magazine is excellent, does incredible work.
[02:40:12.477 --> 02:40:13.618]  I don't think they're bad.
[02:40:13.798 --> 02:40:17.702]  I think on some issues they're far ahead of the pack, and others they're way behind it.
[02:40:17.822 --> 02:40:35.076]  I saw Jasper, what is he, one of their main editors, at Urban Warrior, where the Marines were training with foreign troops to take over America, gun confiscation the whole nine yards, and I had an AP article on me about the black helicopter attacks in Texas and the attempted bribery.
[02:40:36.210 --> 02:40:38.190]  And I gave him that article.
[02:40:38.210 --> 02:40:42.191]  I said, this was out months ago, you know, or six months ago.
[02:40:42.271 --> 02:40:47.492]  I said, you guys are still saying black helicopters are a conspiracy theory.
[02:40:49.372 --> 02:40:49.872]  And you know what?
[02:40:49.892 --> 02:40:53.933]  The next month, I saw that very article printed in there.
[02:40:54.013 --> 02:40:56.954]  So I think they try to be too conservative.
[02:40:56.974 --> 02:41:00.514]  I don't think they're fully aware of all the stuff that's going on.
[02:41:01.815 --> 02:41:04.155]  And, of course, they're going to have infiltrators in any big organization.
[02:41:05.506 --> 02:41:07.467]  But I did read about this.
[02:41:07.867 --> 02:41:08.647]  I should even talk about it.
[02:41:08.667 --> 02:41:09.247]  It's under the article.
[02:41:09.567 --> 02:41:11.568]  This big oil family in Oklahoma.
[02:41:11.588 --> 02:41:17.970]  In fact, they're the biggest independent company that leases wells in the country.
[02:41:19.411 --> 02:41:23.712]  And, well, we'll be right back, and we'll talk more about it.
[02:41:23.732 --> 02:41:25.793]  It was just how they were involved with some of the seed money.
[02:41:25.833 --> 02:41:27.313]  But that was 50 years ago, you know.
[02:41:27.973 --> 02:41:29.114]  And now they're involved with Bush.
[02:41:29.154 --> 02:41:30.154]  Maybe they don't know any better.
[02:41:30.974 --> 02:41:32.175]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:32.375 --> 02:41:33.395]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:44.310]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:44.590 --> 02:41:49.336]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:49.556 --> 02:41:55.204]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.424 --> 02:41:59.947]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:42:00.168 --> 02:42:07.333]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:42:07.353 --> 02:42:11.897]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:42:12.057 --> 02:42:14.579]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:42:14.799 --> 02:42:21.504]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:42:35.726 --> 02:42:39.207]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:42:39.467 --> 02:42:42.988]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[02:42:47.229 --> 02:42:53.390]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:53.790 --> 02:43:01.712]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:43:02.132 --> 02:43:07.477]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:43:07.617 --> 02:43:11.400]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:13.622]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.

[02:44:12.295 --> 02:44:12.896]  We're good to go.
[02:44:46.113 --> 02:44:50.136]  You know, I'm a mad dog when it comes to defending liberty.
[02:44:50.276 --> 02:44:50.957]  I'm rabid.
[02:44:52.338 --> 02:44:53.580]  Look at this, ABC News.
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:55.461]  The U.S.
[02:44:55.481 --> 02:44:58.384]  threatens Belgium over planned war crimes indictment.
[02:44:58.664 --> 02:45:03.409]  And they're now talking about serious repercussions, a new Cold War with Europe.
[02:45:03.509 --> 02:45:05.671]  I mean, how staged does it get?
[02:45:07.142 --> 02:45:10.644]  The people that own our Federal Reserve live in Europe, folks.
[02:45:10.704 --> 02:45:11.945]  It's totally staged.
[02:45:12.025 --> 02:45:13.966]  It'll be a giant good cop, bad cop.
[02:45:14.367 --> 02:45:22.792]  As the New World Order grows, there'll be the UN branch of the New World Order, the American branch of the New World Order, all owned by the same people, gobbling everything up, acting like they're in a fight.
[02:45:23.733 --> 02:45:33.179]  And a Belgian lawyer says he's prepared a case that could see General Franks charged under a law that allows the prosecution of non-Belgian citizens for war crimes.
[02:45:34.469 --> 02:45:35.850]  And so now they're threatening them.
[02:45:36.130 --> 02:45:36.350]  U.S.
[02:45:36.390 --> 02:45:39.371]  warns world that Iran has violated nonproliferation treaty.
[02:45:39.391 --> 02:45:44.513]  United States has called their national community to end a nuclear commerce with Iran.
[02:45:45.474 --> 02:45:47.655]  And it's funny, it's been England and the U.S.
[02:45:47.675 --> 02:45:48.795]  that have been selling them the weapons.
[02:45:49.136 --> 02:45:52.557]  Iraq war helps oil giant BP to biggest quarterly profit ever.
[02:45:53.537 --> 02:45:57.819]  British Petroleum and weapons sales are at world record levels.
[02:45:57.919 --> 02:46:01.541]  As the globalists sell everyone weapons, all the supposed enemies, our government's arming them.
[02:46:02.658 --> 02:46:05.120]  Real quick, Jeff in New York, you're on the air, sir.
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:06.001]  Good to talk to you.
[02:46:06.061 --> 02:46:06.541]  Hey, Alex.
[02:46:06.561 --> 02:46:07.181]  How you doing?
[02:46:07.902 --> 02:46:08.863]  Well, how am I doing?
[02:46:08.903 --> 02:46:09.963]  How's the show sound today?
[02:46:10.063 --> 02:46:10.764]  Sounds pretty good.
[02:46:10.844 --> 02:46:11.484]  Sounds real good.
[02:46:11.524 --> 02:46:14.707]  You sound like you're in a good spirit, which is a blessing to me.
[02:46:14.767 --> 02:46:23.673]  Sometimes you're a little strung out, but other than that, I just wanted to say that I bought your six or seven tape package.
[02:46:24.213 --> 02:46:24.874]  Great tapes.
[02:46:25.614 --> 02:46:29.217]  It's the best money that I have spent in a long time on anything.
[02:46:29.873 --> 02:46:31.794]  Wow, well, I'm about to plug him, so I appreciate that.
[02:46:32.855 --> 02:46:36.116]  Of the six videos of the eight you got, which do you think was the most powerful?
[02:46:37.017 --> 02:46:39.999]  The last one, the 911 Road to Tyranny, was tremendous.
[02:46:40.719 --> 02:46:45.762]  Now, if somebody's going to get the three-tape special to save $18, which three would you tell them to get?
[02:46:46.262 --> 02:46:46.962]  I'd tell them to get the 911.
[02:46:47.082 --> 02:46:55.027]  I'd tell them to get the American Destroyed by Design and either one of the police state takeover tapes.
[02:46:56.167 --> 02:46:57.568]  That's my personal opinion.
[02:46:58.115 --> 02:46:58.956]  I really enjoy them.
[02:46:58.996 --> 02:46:59.917]  They're tremendous.
[02:47:00.337 --> 02:47:01.418]  We homeschool our kids.
[02:47:01.458 --> 02:47:02.319]  We have five of them.
[02:47:02.739 --> 02:47:03.940]  The kids all pay attention.
[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:07.283]  They listen to you at 2 o'clock to 3 o'clock hour here.
[02:47:08.184 --> 02:47:09.665]  We push you all over the place.
[02:47:09.685 --> 02:47:15.871]  We're in the process of making tapes, giving them out, and putting them on the public access station here as well.
[02:47:16.311 --> 02:47:17.152]  Well, that's exciting.
[02:47:17.192 --> 02:47:18.513]  What else is on your mind, my friend?
[02:47:19.474 --> 02:47:19.894]  Not much.
[02:47:19.954 --> 02:47:20.955]  I just want to encourage you.
[02:47:21.396 --> 02:47:23.878]  I appreciate what you're doing, and I appreciate...
[02:47:25.715 --> 02:47:27.035]  You motivate me to do more.
[02:47:27.375 --> 02:47:28.076]  We've got to do it.
[02:47:28.116 --> 02:47:29.076]  We don't have a choice.
[02:47:29.096 --> 02:47:29.856]  Appreciate the call.
[02:47:30.076 --> 02:47:30.557]  Yeah, no problem.
[02:47:31.177 --> 02:47:32.417]  And that's why I get so fired up.
[02:47:32.457 --> 02:47:38.520]  I'm trying to break through the ice where people have never really taken action, and now Jeff's doing that, and I commend you, Jeff.
[02:47:39.201 --> 02:47:55.278]  This hypocrisy and apple pie at a White House Correspondents Association dinner on Saturday night, Pentagon's Prince of Darkness lectured Hans Blix as if he were a colonial subject, instructing him on why an invasion of Iraq had been justified even though no weapons of mass destruction had yet been found.
[02:47:56.232 --> 02:48:02.658]  Asked afterward how Mr. Blixen reacted, Mr. Pearl replied merely, he's a Swedish disarmament lawyer.
[02:48:02.978 --> 02:48:04.279]  He's used to a lot of abuse.
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:15.448]  One partygoer told Mr. Pearl that she would miss the buzzy, standing-room-only black coffee briefings on Iraq held by hardliners, the American Enterprise Institute.
[02:48:15.749 --> 02:48:18.251]  He suggested the neocons might hold another round.
[02:48:18.591 --> 02:48:22.474]  We'll have green tea briefings on North Korea, he said slyly.
[02:48:22.494 --> 02:48:23.275]  Ugh.
[02:48:25.296 --> 02:48:27.758]  And he goes on, they're going to attack everybody.
[02:48:27.858 --> 02:48:28.918]  Ha ha ha!
[02:48:29.619 --> 02:48:33.401]  And this is meant to be seen worldwide as evil and bad to demonize America.
[02:48:33.621 --> 02:48:34.602]  This isn't America.
[02:48:34.642 --> 02:48:39.465]  This is Europe controlling us as their glove, as their front man, as their patsy.
[02:48:40.106 --> 02:48:40.866]  They get it all.
[02:48:40.946 --> 02:48:43.548]  They get the holdings, everything.
[02:48:44.468 --> 02:48:46.069]  You heard that caller about the videos.
[02:48:46.530 --> 02:48:48.111]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:48:48.531 --> 02:48:49.972]  Go to InfoWars.net.

[02:48:53.614 --> 02:48:54.595]  Support the broadcast.

[02:49:02.299 --> 02:49:06.500]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:09.921]  Or infowars.com or net.
[02:49:09.981 --> 02:49:11.722]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight central.
[02:49:11.762 --> 02:49:12.482]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:49:12.602 --> 02:49:14.843]  And then 9 to midnight, of course, Friday.
[02:49:15.363 --> 02:49:16.884]  Infowars.com or net.
[02:49:17.484 --> 02:49:17.784]  Or 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:17.844 --> 02:49:18.584]  Get real, as they say.
[02:49:26.346 --> 02:49:29.833]  Sharon lost 28 pounds with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:49:29.974 --> 02:49:36.908]  Because I lost 28 pounds and my husband could see the difference in me, I encourage him to start taking Vim and Vigor also because...
