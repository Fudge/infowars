[00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:06.787]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:15.334]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:17.035]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:18.877]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.517 --> 00:00:20.318]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.039]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:26.383]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:29.185]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:30.946]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.370]  It's already Tuesday, the 4th of November 2003.
[00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:45.171]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:50.073]  We'll be live the next three hours on this 4th of November 2003 transmission.
[00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:52.574]  The websites have been updated.
[00:00:52.614 --> 00:00:57.636]  They're prisonplanet.com and infowars.com as well as infowars.net.
[00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:14.580]  We've got some folks coming on from the Paragon Foundation, the premier land rights organization with some new tricks they've found to defeat these federal and state courts in their land grabbing operations.
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.761]  Also, there's a lot of Rothschild activity in the mainstream media.
[00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:21.922]  We'll be going over some of that.
[00:01:21.942 --> 00:01:23.082]  In fact, here's some of the news.
[00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:23.742]  Organic
[00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:30.732]  Valley Blast FDA support for animal cloning warns people are not guinea pigs.
[00:01:30.772 --> 00:01:36.215]  They're getting ready to approve cloned cows, pigs, sheep, everything.
[00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:39.096]  And you're not going to be told about it.
[00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:40.397]  It's going to be on your plate.
[00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:41.997]  It's going to be at the supermarkets.
[00:01:42.217 --> 00:01:43.398]  It's going to be everywhere.
[00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:48.597]  The sun cut loose with three major flares in less than 24 hours.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:22.984]  Bringing to the number nine, the number of major eruptions in less than two weeks, scientists have never witnessed a string of activity like this.
[00:02:23.064 --> 00:02:26.285]  Another headline, BBC, what is happening to the sun?
[00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:38.190]  This is very, very serious, because in 200 years of watching the sun, 150 years of real data being gathered, this has never happened.
[00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:39.827]  Never happened.
[00:02:39.987 --> 00:02:43.890]  I mean, two weeks ago they said it was the biggest flare since 1859.
[00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.134]  Then last week they had another flare that was 100 times bigger than that.
[00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:57.079]  And I've seen photos of the sun and the size of the coils that are being launched from it in the past.
[00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.081]  And I'm looking at a photo here of the sun yesterday ejecting a bunch of these.
[00:03:01.742 --> 00:03:04.964]  And these things are gigantic.
[00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.545]  They're bigger than the sun itself.
[00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:07.946]  It is massive.
[00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:12.225]  That's what the articles say, so we'll go over that too early in this hour.
[00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:20.995]  Bush wins his $87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan, so the war is not going to end until Halliburton and others have sucked that dry.
[00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:22.757]  The troops won't get a dime of it, of course.
[00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:25.020]  They won't even get health care when they're shot.
[00:03:25.941 --> 00:03:26.962]  That's mainstream news.
[00:03:28.227 --> 00:03:28.827]  Also, U.S.
[00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:42.091]  will seek another $2.22 billion for military aid for Israel, China to help Pakistan, our gallant little ally, build a second nuclear power plant that's being used to build nuclear warheads for missiles.
[00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:47.273]  Missiles that can now hit parts of the U.S., and they're also helping arm North Korea.
[00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:51.034]  But the Pentagon and Echelon are going to watch you and your family.
[00:03:51.114 --> 00:03:52.394]  The border's going to stay wide open.
[00:03:52.414 --> 00:03:53.975]  They're going to arm all these enemies, okay?
[00:03:55.495 --> 00:03:56.115]  We're good to go.
[00:03:56.175 --> 00:03:57.976]  We're good to go.
[00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:29.473]  About a year and a half ago, Australia, after taking the guns, banned any protest of the IMF, World Bank, or military activities.
[00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:33.837]  They said, if you're out on the street protesting anything, we're allowed to shoot you dead.
[00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:34.658]  That was the headline.
[00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.899]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.681]  It was out of the mainstream papers.
[00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:44.207]  Well, a man used a cell phone to send an email, non-threatening, protesting to the U.S.
[00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:44.627]  Embassy.
[00:04:44.647 --> 00:04:45.928]  They requested he be arrested.
[00:04:45.968 --> 00:04:47.309]  He has been arrested.
[00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.670]  So now...
[00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:51.074]  In Australia, you send emails just protesting.
[00:04:51.615 --> 00:04:52.196]  You're arrested.
[00:04:52.236 --> 00:04:53.417]  This is Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.860]  They calmly report it like it's a good thing.
[00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:58.503]  That's your new democracy, folks.
[00:04:59.644 --> 00:05:00.205]  Let me see this.
[00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:04.370]  I've gone through about two centimeters of stories, and it's about four inches thick.
[00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.532]  It's all coming up when we get back.
[00:05:06.552 --> 00:05:07.053]  Stay with us.
[00:05:07.113 --> 00:05:07.994]  Big old stack of stuff.
[00:05:09.887 --> 00:05:16.712]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:17.032 --> 00:05:18.393]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:18.593 --> 00:05:20.815]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:23.057]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:23.337 --> 00:05:28.261]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:32.644]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:32.884 --> 00:05:33.324]  We're good to go.
[00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.654]  That's 888-253-3139 or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[00:06:03.934 --> 00:06:06.355]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:07.276 --> 00:06:09.857]  Oh my God!
[00:06:10.117 --> 00:06:14.860]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.060]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[00:06:20.325 --> 00:06:21.146]  This is Pat Cooper.
[00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:23.849]  Tony DelVecchio is coming to this station very soon.
[00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.631]  I book any day now.
[00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:27.013]  You're going to love his show.
[00:06:28.694 --> 00:06:33.860]  That's all about this with your host, Tony DelVecchio, Saturday evenings from 9 to 10 p.m.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.164]  Central Time, right here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:06:38.624 --> 00:06:39.545]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:46.710]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[00:06:46.991 --> 00:06:49.873]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[00:06:50.073 --> 00:06:55.717]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:58.139]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:04.885]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[00:07:10.051 --> 00:07:14.573]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:07:14.913 --> 00:07:18.995]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:19.835]  We listened.
[00:07:20.155 --> 00:07:25.137]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:07:25.397 --> 00:07:25.898]  We listened.
[00:07:26.278 --> 00:07:29.319]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:30.279]  We listened.
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.101]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:34.701]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.352 --> 00:08:04.634]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:08:05.115 --> 00:08:06.516]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.406]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:18.006 --> 00:08:20.989]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:34.030]  I have a big old stack here of articles about, well, the bizarre activities, the unusual activities of Sol, or the sun.
[00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:43.921]  In the hundreds of years that they have been tracking the corona of the sun, they've never seen as much activity, but, I mean, obviously...
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:09:01.665]  150 years in the scope of the life of the sun isn't that long, and so we haven't observed enough of the cycles to know if this is really serious, though it can affect satellites and power lines and different electronics here on the ground.
[00:09:01.745 --> 00:09:08.908]  But according to the scientists, they're very concerned because it's not just shooting out record...
[00:09:10.189 --> 00:09:19.173]  Record ejections of superheated plasma at millions of miles an hour towards the Earth and then dissipating into radiation or light.
[00:09:20.413 --> 00:09:22.254]  It's doing it every day now.
[00:09:22.714 --> 00:09:23.195]  Massive.
[00:09:23.235 --> 00:09:29.497]  They're getting bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more frequent in the last two years.
[00:09:31.098 --> 00:09:35.480]  And now in the last three weeks, that's geometrically grown.
[00:09:36.266 --> 00:09:36.726]  We're good to go.
[00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:36.887]  I think?
[00:10:05.962 --> 00:10:06.542]  We're good to go.
[00:10:27.032 --> 00:10:35.837]  Very soon, because they know we have a population that doesn't know where Iraq is on the map, doesn't know where England is on the map, doesn't know who the vice president is.
[00:10:35.897 --> 00:10:41.380]  The vast majority, including the British people, the vast majority, don't know who their deputy prime minister is.
[00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:46.183]  People don't know how many, again, continents there are, what the Fifth or Fourth Amendment is.
[00:10:47.664 --> 00:10:52.907]  And so, when the government tells them, give up your cars, let us tax and trace you, there's global warming caused by...
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.241]  By different chemicals, and all the evidence shows it's a fraud, but they don't care.
[00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:01.361]  I mean, you're talking to people who don't know their head from a hole in the ground.
[00:11:02.602 --> 00:11:05.222]  But we'll go over the situation with the sun.
[00:11:05.262 --> 00:11:12.124]  I guess it's time to escape to Mars and start the terra farming now and move into the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
[00:11:12.344 --> 00:11:14.624]  They say that those are habitable.
[00:11:14.684 --> 00:11:16.304]  We could live on those.
[00:11:16.345 --> 00:11:23.486]  In fact, we already have the technology to do it, but of course the globalists are too busy suppressing us and dumbing us down to have any real vision for humanity.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.363]  It would be smart, because we never know when an asteroid is going to slam into us and we're going to have nuclear war.
[00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:32.545]  We need to get off this planet immediately.
[00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:38.549]  We want to boost the economy, start a massive space program.
[00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:54.800]  And again, now we're getting off into my dreams and vision, but instead the space is going to be a military zone of space planes and particle beam nuclear bomb platform space stations.
[00:11:55.405 --> 00:11:56.325]  Circling the earth.
[00:11:58.906 --> 00:11:59.426]  All right.
[00:11:59.966 --> 00:12:01.806]  Just continuing with the news here.
[00:12:01.906 --> 00:12:02.927]  Boy, there's a lot of it.
[00:12:03.007 --> 00:12:03.867]  I mean, how to cover it?
[00:12:03.887 --> 00:12:04.567]  You know what I'm going to do?
[00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:10.468]  I'm not going to comment in any depth until I go through all these articles, just letting you know what's out there, okay?
[00:12:11.508 --> 00:12:24.271]  FDA is supporting animal cloning, and there's warnings that people are not getting pigs, but the FDA says they're going to approve it, and it's going to be on your store shelves possibly within months, and they're about to flood the market
[00:12:25.023 --> 00:12:41.549]  With thousands of canisters, each canister containing hundreds of cloned embryos of bulls and prized bulls and cows and horses and pigs and sheep and ducks and everything else, folks.
[00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:53.614]  And if we follow what the globalists have done in the past, they will genetically engineer this stuff like they've done the plants where it can't reproduce, where you've got to keep buying the clones from them.
[00:12:55.134 --> 00:12:57.075]  It's about patenting life, creating a monopoly.
[00:12:57.115 --> 00:13:01.277]  But I said I wouldn't get into any depth, and I'm already breaking that statement instantly.
[00:13:01.317 --> 00:13:03.018]  But that's coming up.
[00:13:03.418 --> 00:13:05.119]  Sales of cloned cattle multiply.
[00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:06.259]  It's already going on in mass.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.981]  Sun on fire unleashes three more major flares.
[00:13:10.101 --> 00:13:12.182]  What is happening to the sun, the BBC says.
[00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:16.204]  The sun's intense activity in the past week will go into the record books.
[00:13:17.345 --> 00:13:19.666]  And it's causing people to see Aurora Borealis'
[00:13:21.527 --> 00:13:24.289]  Well, it's the Aurora Borealis if it's up north.
[00:13:24.489 --> 00:13:29.674]  I guess it's the Aurora Australias if it's down around Australia where they have a thin atmosphere.
[00:13:29.714 --> 00:13:31.415]  But now they're seeing them.
[00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:36.460]  Well, a couple nights ago I was out at night and they had a clear sky.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.744]  I was out in East Texas visiting with families and my grandmother died.
[00:13:42.205 --> 00:13:46.108]  I looked up and there was weird northern lights in East Texas.
[00:13:46.408 --> 00:13:48.070]  And there's an article here about that too.
[00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:54.311]  Bush wins $87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:13:55.432 --> 00:13:57.472]  So I hope you enjoy that little tax increase.
[00:13:58.112 --> 00:14:03.554]  And the government's seeking another $2.22 billion for military aid to Israel.
[00:14:03.674 --> 00:14:07.195]  China is helping Pakistan build second nuclear power plant.
[00:14:08.595 --> 00:14:09.035]  Oh, boy.
[00:14:09.475 --> 00:14:10.076]  And U.S.
[00:14:10.116 --> 00:14:14.697]  military upholds TV coverage ban on Iraq coffins.
[00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:16.472]  40 people died yesterday.
[00:14:16.492 --> 00:14:16.552]  Hmm...
[00:14:46.255 --> 00:14:47.536]  Boy, that's a bad day.
[00:14:47.676 --> 00:14:51.737]  That's like the end of Vietnam or something, those that high of numbers.
[00:14:52.898 --> 00:14:53.118]  U.S.
[00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:56.279]  military upholds TV coverage ban for Iraq coffins.
[00:14:56.339 --> 00:14:57.240]  Hmm, our free country.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.381]  Israeli warplanes overfly South Lebanon.
[00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:05.203]  Anti-war protester sent an email to the government, and they say all protests is banned.
[00:15:05.243 --> 00:15:07.644]  He has been arrested under terrorism charges.
[00:15:08.004 --> 00:15:08.785]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:11.726]  This is the National Paper of Australia's City Morning Herald.
[00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:17.442]  Another article out of Wired Magazine about how wonderful Australia's touchscreen systems are, how we need those.
[00:15:17.762 --> 00:15:18.322]  Give me a break.
[00:15:18.682 --> 00:15:20.384]  Aussies do it right, e-voting.
[00:15:21.985 --> 00:15:29.030]  Rothschild brought on board at Sky Television as SOP to anti-Murdock camp.
[00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.572]  Now, boy, what a twisted headline.
[00:15:31.612 --> 00:15:32.292]  It's not accurate.
[00:15:34.409 --> 00:15:35.410]  That's not one independent.
[00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:53.138]  Again, those Rothschilds, just gubernatorial elections with Schwarzenegger, land-grabbing organizations, Ford Foundation, IMF, World Bank, Federal Reserve Control, currency speculation, Enron scamming, Venezuelan coups, TV takeovers.
[00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:59.317]  Financing and controlling sci-fi channel and most of the big UFO talk show host.
[00:15:59.718 --> 00:16:01.682]  That's, by the way, Kansas City Star, New York Times.
[00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:04.147]  It's always a Rothschild sneaking about.
[00:16:05.049 --> 00:16:12.353]  According to law enforcement pamphlets, to say the word Rothschild, they say that it is an imaginary code word of terrorism.
[00:16:12.693 --> 00:16:16.455]  It's like if you say posse comitatus, police have been taught, that's a code for terror.
[00:16:16.495 --> 00:16:17.336]  No, it's a federal law.
[00:16:17.356 --> 00:16:19.977]  It's like, we talk about real people, it doesn't exist, we're crazy.
[00:16:20.177 --> 00:16:24.140]  We talk about real laws, that's the tactic, folks.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.500]  Government is corrupt.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.301]  Ha ha ha, the sitcom says.
[00:16:27.662 --> 00:16:29.382]  Only crazy people say that.
[00:16:29.923 --> 00:16:33.805]  But again, Rothschild brought on board at Sky a shop to the anti-Murdoch camp.
[00:16:35.387 --> 00:16:43.309]  And out of Channel News Asia, as well as Itartos, two different articles here, Itartos is the official Russian news agency, by the way.
[00:16:44.489 --> 00:16:47.490]  Russian foreign minister rejects U.S.
[00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.291]  criticism over tycoon's arrest.
[00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:53.952]  And again, all you have is different globalist criminals robbing each other over there.
[00:16:54.272 --> 00:16:56.532]  Russia is the same as it always was, command and control.
[00:16:56.552 --> 00:17:03.074]  Call it fascist, call it communist, call it a plutocracy, call it an oligarchy, call it whatever you want, it's all command and control.
[00:17:04.668 --> 00:17:08.851]  Russian Foreign Minister Igor Enovov rejected U.S.
[00:17:08.891 --> 00:17:17.397]  criticism over arrest of oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and pointed the finger at the financial scandals in the United States, saying, oh, look at your Enron.
[00:17:17.477 --> 00:17:18.318]  Yeah, and who's involved?
[00:17:18.358 --> 00:17:18.858]  Same people.
[00:17:18.878 --> 00:17:20.239]  It says right here.
[00:17:20.299 --> 00:17:20.779]  Listen to this.
[00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:33.869]  To complicate issues further, a London newspaper claimed Sunday that control of the shares in Yukos, the biggest oil company in Russia and owned by the richest man in Russia, has passed to a member of the Rothschild banking family...
[00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:44.743]  Under a deal which they hammered out prior to the Russian oil baron's arrest, voting rights to be shares passed to Lord Jacob Rothschild.
[00:17:44.783 --> 00:17:50.008]  Oh, the guy, we have a photo of him with Arnold meeting last September with Warren Buffett.
[00:17:50.369 --> 00:18:00.278]  67, under a previously unknown agreement, oh, previously unknown, was trying to take effect in the event that Korodosky could no longer act as beneficiary of the shares, the Sunday Times said.
[00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:09.393]  Rothschild now controls the voting rights on the stakes of Yukos with almost 8 billion pounds, or 11.6 billion euros, 13.5 billion dollars.
[00:18:09.493 --> 00:18:10.874]  Ooh, look, a dollar.
[00:18:10.894 --> 00:18:13.776]  13.5 billion to 11.6 billion euros.
[00:18:14.297 --> 00:18:17.099]  Just a year ago, it was the opposite ratio.
[00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:18.259]  Where's your currency?
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.121]  The newspaper sent in a dispatch from Moscow.
[00:18:22.582 --> 00:18:25.844]  By the way, they're applying morphine to you as they suck your blood out.
[00:18:26.225 --> 00:18:29.607]  The media's going, the economy's doing real nice right now.
[00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.514]  All the debt explodes, all the foreclosures rampage, all the trade deficit balloons.
[00:18:34.534 --> 00:18:37.396]  They're going, oh, we had increased manufacturing.
[00:18:37.436 --> 00:18:38.517]  The stock market's up.
[00:18:40.599 --> 00:18:41.720]  Uh, yeah.
[00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:43.862]  Yeah.
[00:18:44.782 --> 00:18:47.525]  Enjoy the drugs they give you as they assanguate you.
[00:18:49.068 --> 00:18:52.590]  My whole point is, I told you Russia was owned by the Rothschilds.
[00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:56.873]  They've got about half the shares, or 51% in Russian ownership, since about 1918.
[00:18:57.193 --> 00:19:12.522]  The other 49% is shared by the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha German-Dutch royal family that runs England and uses those good people as their power engine the last 200 years to create a world empire.
[00:19:12.582 --> 00:19:17.045]  We're now going to be the main engine here in the U.S., with a subsidiary frigate being England.
[00:19:18.687 --> 00:19:20.908]  It is subsidiary attack cruiser.
[00:19:21.208 --> 00:19:23.429]  You want to look at it in terms of capital ships.
[00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.230]  And it's always the Rothschilds.
[00:19:26.411 --> 00:19:28.832]  Tenron, PNAC, you name it, Rothschilds.
[00:19:28.912 --> 00:19:30.172]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rothschilds.
[00:19:30.512 --> 00:19:31.913]  Porn industry, Rothschilds.
[00:19:32.693 --> 00:19:34.174]  Owning our media, Rothschilds.
[00:19:34.274 --> 00:19:35.775]  Turnover, Rothschilds.
[00:19:35.815 --> 00:19:37.716]  Funding the ACLU, Rothschilds.
[00:19:38.276 --> 00:19:46.460]  Rothschilds, Rothschilds, Rothschilds, Rothschilds, Rothschilds, Rothschilds, Rothschilds, Rothschilds, Rothschilds, Rothschilds.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:55.429]  The biggest, the baddest, the top of the pyramid, your enemy, sworn to annihilate 80-95% of you in their own policy papers.
[00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:57.491]  But again, they don't exist.
[00:19:57.511 --> 00:19:59.513]  Law enforcement manuals say it's an imaginary family.
[00:19:59.753 --> 00:20:00.394]  Doesn't exist.
[00:20:00.474 --> 00:20:01.355]  Only terrorists talk about them.
[00:20:01.735 --> 00:20:03.938]  Yeah, because they wrote the manuals for you, boys.
[00:20:04.879 --> 00:20:06.861]  Don't worry about the chief mafia, Don.
[00:20:06.881 --> 00:20:08.503]  You just go back to pulling old ladies over.
[00:20:10.214 --> 00:20:10.655]  Gold.
[00:20:10.995 --> 00:20:12.296]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:12.536 --> 00:20:18.642]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:20:18.822 --> 00:20:22.646]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:20:23.006 --> 00:20:24.888]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:20:24.948 --> 00:20:27.230]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:32.295]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fee
[00:20:32.295 --> 00:20:32.735]  We're good to go.
[00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:54.036]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[00:20:54.056 --> 00:20:54.917]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:09.509 --> 00:21:10.109]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:10.129 --> 00:21:11.150]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:17.233]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:17.493 --> 00:21:22.615]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:22.955 --> 00:21:32.260]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.542]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.

[00:24:20.999 --> 00:24:23.401]  Weekdays, 11 to 2 Central.
[00:24:24.262 --> 00:24:27.484]  Standard time we're here live, and then of course 9 to midnight Central.
[00:24:29.666 --> 00:24:40.294]  Getting back to the Rothschilds, I told you Warren Buffett is just one of about 50 managers that we know of that work for the Rothschilds.
[00:24:41.515 --> 00:24:47.980]  And everybody says, oh, how does the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, how does he always know what's going to happen?
[00:24:49.676 --> 00:24:58.864]  You know, how does George Soros, the big currency speculator and financier, how does he always know what's going to happen before it happens?
[00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:03.067]  How do these guys have this crystal ball?
[00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:10.053]  Every time I turn around, they're chairman of the board of dozens of Rothschild-owned companies.
[00:25:11.997 --> 00:25:17.560]  And they're always involved putting people into office, getting referendums passed, manipulating currency.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:29.585]  And right now, all the different Rothschild agents from Japan to the United States to China to Israel are running around bad-mouthing the dollar.
[00:25:30.725 --> 00:25:36.628]  And we've got simultaneously Treasury Secretary Snow, Bush, everybody bad-mouthing the dollar.
[00:25:36.648 --> 00:25:40.590]  And it just plunges and plunges and plunges and plunges and plunges.
[00:25:42.085 --> 00:25:46.487]  The money you have in the bank's been deteriorated in its value by about 30%.
[00:25:50.249 --> 00:25:51.270]  And it's killing us.
[00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.191]  And our trade deficit's out of control.
[00:25:54.211 --> 00:25:57.433]  And they're telling you how good the economy is.
[00:25:57.473 --> 00:25:58.633]  The real economy.
[00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:02.435]  That is wealth creation for the middle class.
[00:26:02.875 --> 00:26:06.057]  People coming out of poverty is in horrible shape.
[00:26:06.157 --> 00:26:09.258]  More people are going into poverty at record levels in U.S.
[00:26:09.298 --> 00:26:10.619]  history since the Great Depression.
[00:26:11.383 --> 00:26:18.126]  More debt is here than has ever been here, corporate, private, public, that is governmental.
[00:26:18.987 --> 00:26:20.468]  And I'm not trying to be gloom and doom here.
[00:26:21.288 --> 00:26:27.811]  It's just you sit here and you watch the news and they tell you how great it is, and so you think, well, I must be a loser then because I'm not doing good.
[00:26:27.851 --> 00:26:32.473]  I better try to keep my chin up and go out and go into debt or something this Christmas.
[00:26:32.514 --> 00:26:35.415]  Maybe that'll fix the problems for me.
[00:26:38.314 --> 00:26:38.674]  We're good to go.
[00:26:38.694 --> 00:26:39.134]  We're good to go.
[00:27:09.304 --> 00:27:15.908]  And then now those six strongmen, if they don't follow orders, they get arrested and it gets handed back over to the Rothschilds.
[00:27:16.008 --> 00:27:18.650]  And then they hand it over to some new puppet manager.
[00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.271]  And that's all that's happening.
[00:27:20.591 --> 00:27:31.118]  Now, some people could say, well, this really shows that Russia and China and everybody are lining up against the globalists and Western world and the Rothschilds because they're trying to seize Rothschild wealth right now.
[00:27:32.138 --> 00:27:34.780]  But I don't believe that's the case here.
[00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:42.206]  But again, some people out there who have done their analysis and who I respect say that is happening.
[00:27:44.027 --> 00:27:45.008]  But only at a certain level.
[00:27:45.028 --> 00:28:00.040]  It's like yesterday when I read about Henry Ford right through into World War II with the slave labor at the Ford plants building Panzers and ball bearings and car parts and parts for Messerschmitts and Folk Wolfs, and he wouldn't build engines for the RAF.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:00.460]  Remember that?
[00:28:02.168 --> 00:28:03.469]  Remember that story yesterday?
[00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.930]  Out of the London Telegraph?
[00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.772]  It's on InfoWars.com and yesterday's news.
[00:28:06.792 --> 00:28:07.292]  You want to see it?
[00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:09.674]  But it's the same thing.
[00:28:09.714 --> 00:28:10.695]  It was IBM.
[00:28:10.775 --> 00:28:13.557]  It was General Electric, General Motors.
[00:28:13.577 --> 00:28:14.598]  They were all involved.
[00:28:15.239 --> 00:28:18.041]  Bush's grandfather, Prescott, all of them.
[00:28:19.302 --> 00:28:20.763]  Joseph Kennedy, all of them.
[00:28:21.123 --> 00:28:22.204]  Roosevelt was involved.
[00:28:22.364 --> 00:28:22.785]  All of them.
[00:28:23.986 --> 00:28:25.187]  They create the Saddams.
[00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:26.207]  They create the Hitlers.
[00:28:26.568 --> 00:28:29.890]  They create the Stalins and the Lenins and the Mows.
[00:28:30.491 --> 00:28:31.592]  History Channel admits...
[00:28:32.622 --> 00:28:38.043]  They had an old former section chief, 80-something years old, and he goes, yeah, in 49, we put Mao in.
[00:28:39.724 --> 00:28:43.825]  We thought he was more of a stabilizing effect.
[00:28:44.585 --> 00:28:47.845]  And I already had read that and knew that, but again, I almost fell out of my chair.
[00:28:47.905 --> 00:28:54.627]  I screamed at the television because it made me so angry that they think we're so stupid that they can just throw it out in our face now.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.361]  You don't like communists?
[00:28:57.381 --> 00:29:07.726]  You don't like all the troops we've had die fighting them in Korea and fighting them in Vietnam and fighting them in Cuba and fighting them in Latin America and fighting them in Eastern Europe and all these clandestine operations?
[00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:09.327]  What Pol Pot did?
[00:29:09.347 --> 00:29:10.927]  And what the Chinese did?
[00:29:11.368 --> 00:29:15.470]  Well, you better start disliking the Rothschilds and the Saxe-Coburg Gothas.
[00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.091]  That's the House of Windsor.
[00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:21.304]  You better start knowing who your rulers are.
[00:29:21.604 --> 00:29:26.985]  See, if you don't even know who your rulers are, your owners are, how are you ever going to be free from them?
[00:29:27.245 --> 00:29:32.266]  At least a black slave on a plantation knew who their owners were and knew how to fight back.
[00:29:33.387 --> 00:29:35.407]  But you don't even know who your owners are.
[00:29:36.967 --> 00:29:43.469]  Well, they may have a lot of control over my life, but I'm not owned by them because I'm a free human being standing up and fighting back against them.
[00:29:46.773 --> 00:29:58.058]  All right, we're going to come back and take calls and get into a whole other stack of news and detail more of what I already mentioned about the sun acting very jittery, about the economy, what's going on in Iraq.
[00:29:58.098 --> 00:29:58.578]  Stay with us.
[00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:01.679]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.780]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.701 --> 00:30:07.382]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.908 --> 00:30:14.811]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:30:15.051 --> 00:30:20.476]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:30:20.756 --> 00:30:31.124]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:30:31.304 --> 00:30:35.628]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:30:35.808 --> 00:30:44.174]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:30:44.454 --> 00:30:50.819]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:55.402]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:30:55.622 --> 00:30:59.845]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:31:00.206 --> 00:31:04.509]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:06.410]  803-4438.
[00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.233]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:09.253 --> 00:31:11.475]  Hi, this is Joyce Reiling.
[00:31:11.535 --> 00:31:14.458]  As a nurse, I know the dangers of toxins and heavy metals in the body.
[00:31:14.798 --> 00:31:19.883]  Chelation treatments can rid the body of these toxins, but it can be expensive, time-consuming, and inconvenient.
[00:31:20.003 --> 00:31:21.944]  But now there's Detoximin.
[00:31:22.365 --> 00:31:25.708]  Dr. Bruce Halstead, the grandfather of EDTA chelation therapy, says that
[00:31:26.028 --> 00:31:31.033]  Detoxamine is the only chelation suppository product on the market that has all the following attributes.
[00:31:31.353 --> 00:31:37.479]  It's legal, safe, comfortable to use, and has documented proof of its consistent effectiveness in its ability to chelate.
[00:31:37.959 --> 00:31:44.445]  Ten chelation treatments would cost about $1,000, but you can get approximately the same amount of chelation therapy for $289.95.
[00:31:44.866 --> 00:31:50.691]  This is an amazing breakthrough, and now you can rid your body of heavy metals and toxins in the privacy of your own home.
[00:31:51.091 --> 00:31:51.511]  We're good to go.
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.101]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:13.681]  Pollution.
[00:32:13.721 --> 00:32:14.001]  Pollen.
[00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:15.161]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:32:15.221 --> 00:32:15.622]  Allergies.
[00:32:15.742 --> 00:32:16.042]  Asthma.
[00:32:16.082 --> 00:32:16.662]  Probably not.
[00:32:16.782 --> 00:32:17.522]  Well, listen to this.
[00:32:17.762 --> 00:32:26.725]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[00:32:26.805 --> 00:32:27.645]  Six to ten times.
[00:32:27.665 --> 00:32:28.725]  How could that be, you ask?
[00:32:28.826 --> 00:32:29.066]  Worse.
[00:32:29.166 --> 00:32:30.486]  Think about what's inside your home.
[00:32:30.666 --> 00:32:31.306]  Hairspray.
[00:32:31.426 --> 00:32:31.926]  Chemicals.
[00:32:31.946 --> 00:32:32.907]  Does anyone smoke?
[00:32:32.947 --> 00:32:33.207]  Fumes.
[00:32:33.347 --> 00:32:35.027]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:32:35.488 --> 00:32:37.088]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:32:37.128 --> 00:32:37.828]  Toxic fumes.
[00:32:37.848 --> 00:32:38.889]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[00:32:38.929 --> 00:32:39.909]  Oh, Rod, you're so funny.
[00:32:39.929 --> 00:32:40.389]  They go...
[00:32:40.469 --> 00:32:41.109]  We're good to go.
[00:32:41.129 --> 00:32:41.710]  We're good to go.
[00:33:20.558 --> 00:33:31.170]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're halfway into this first hour.
[00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:36.756]  We do have the Paragon Foundation coming on to talk about ways to stand up to the land grabbers in the third hour.
[00:33:36.776 --> 00:33:40.380]  I think a lot of calls covered a ton of news in the next hour and a half.
[00:33:41.092 --> 00:33:47.875]  Before we get our guest on, the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:48.215 --> 00:33:54.297]  We're about to go to Brock and Ron and Phil and Dylan and others that are patiently holding here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:54.737 --> 00:33:58.939]  Then I'm going to go back into more detail about the Rothschilds involved in taking over the oil supply.
[00:33:58.979 --> 00:34:03.301]  They've always been in control, but reasserting that in Russia.
[00:34:04.005 --> 00:34:07.267]  And the Rothschilds involved taking over the media in England.
[00:34:07.308 --> 00:34:08.649]  That's another headline here.
[00:34:08.669 --> 00:34:14.693]  Again, they've already been in control, but now they're expanding the consolidation over new media that's moved into England.
[00:34:16.434 --> 00:34:22.639]  And coming up, driver's license facilities gearing up for immigrant licenses out in California.
[00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:24.100]  Arnold's going to continue that, of course.
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.602]  He's going to continue every Davis policy.
[00:34:26.622 --> 00:34:32.186]  He was involved in the Enron scamming with Michael Milken and Ken Lay of Enron fame.
[00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:33.459]  Here's another one.
[00:34:33.879 --> 00:34:36.480]  Bush to meet firefighters in Schwarzenegger.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:48.244]  So Bush can now grandstand around in the moonscape of Southern California, which they admit the Army, in quote, drills set the southerly fires outside San Diego.
[00:34:48.344 --> 00:34:54.346]  So Bush is going to be, it says, in a cowboy hat and cowboy boots, literally, strutting around with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:34:55.666 --> 00:34:56.686]  This is really sick.
[00:34:56.986 --> 00:35:02.088]  And again, President Vicente Fox is going to be in Austin tomorrow, throughout the rest of the week, and then in...
[00:35:04.412 --> 00:35:10.336]  Out in Arizona, telling the governor here, Rick Perry, and the governor in Arizona to give us blanket amnesty.
[00:35:10.797 --> 00:35:14.219]  And he's saying, give Mexico blanket amnesty.
[00:35:14.619 --> 00:35:15.440]  Give us what we want.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:24.566]  And I heard the Neocon talk show this morning in Austin, the big number one morning talk show, the conservatives, going, well, we do need to go ahead and track these illegals.
[00:35:24.606 --> 00:35:26.948]  Let's go ahead and let them have the guest worker program.
[00:35:27.028 --> 00:35:30.090]  Oh, yeah, blanket amnesty for everybody here and whoever can get here.
[00:35:31.508 --> 00:35:35.570]  And the local papers and the national papers are saying, go ahead and capitulate.
[00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:36.851]  There's 30 million illegals.
[00:35:37.731 --> 00:35:39.092]  Just go ahead and give in to it.
[00:35:39.492 --> 00:35:40.413]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:35:40.513 --> 00:35:41.553]  Pan-American Union.
[00:35:41.893 --> 00:35:45.135]  So, 89% of you want the borders shut.
[00:35:45.155 --> 00:35:45.915]  Illegals deported.
[00:35:47.016 --> 00:35:48.917]  The media tries to make it a racial issue.
[00:35:50.298 --> 00:35:55.440]  Last night at dinner, I couldn't even eat dinner because so many great folks came over at the restaurant I was eating at.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.921]  Roadhouse Steakhouse with my wife.
[00:35:58.722 --> 00:36:00.983]  Out of 20 people that came over to the table, most of them were Hispanic
[00:36:01.556 --> 00:36:03.617]  Folks, they're all against the open borders and what's happening.
[00:36:03.637 --> 00:36:06.798]  They know it's killing our economy, but the media tries to make it racial.
[00:36:08.058 --> 00:36:09.019]  We'll get into that.
[00:36:10.059 --> 00:36:13.601]  New card removes stigma of food stamps, welfare checks.
[00:36:14.121 --> 00:36:16.602]  Biometric passports suffer bumpy ride.
[00:36:16.942 --> 00:36:19.563]  Countries want digital identifiers and passports by next year.
[00:36:19.943 --> 00:36:21.103]  Will the technology be ready?
[00:36:22.364 --> 00:36:23.844]  See, the question is, do we want this?
[00:36:23.884 --> 00:36:25.165]  The question is, does it work?
[00:36:25.965 --> 00:36:29.046]  And globally, the UN said two years ago, all countries by 2050
[00:36:31.639 --> 00:36:34.942]  Must have a world ID number and biometric system.
[00:36:34.962 --> 00:36:35.943]  This is world ID card.
[00:36:35.963 --> 00:36:36.523]  We'll get to that.
[00:36:36.543 --> 00:36:46.211]  Applied Digital Solutions is buying up cell phones to companies in technology and moving into satellites so they can own the entire chain of their control system with their implantable chips.
[00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:49.674]  Walmart to hold ID tag meeting.
[00:36:49.794 --> 00:36:51.275]  I ought to force that on you.
[00:36:51.295 --> 00:36:53.397]  That's from CNET News, the little tracker chips.
[00:36:53.757 --> 00:36:55.719]  China wants to have its own space station.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.863]  Construction surges to record in September.
[00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:04.672]  And October factory growth fastest since 2000.
[00:37:05.133 --> 00:37:09.136]  Yeah, and they count prison factories being built being part of that.
[00:37:10.237 --> 00:37:11.819]  But there's another editorial here.
[00:37:12.239 --> 00:37:17.504]  The Capital Times, trade deficit foils economy and is really having a bad effect.
[00:37:18.044 --> 00:37:19.185]  That's what's destroying us.
[00:37:19.806 --> 00:37:22.448]  The tax cuts, the small tax cuts have helped, though.
[00:37:23.609 --> 00:37:26.672]  And, folks, there's just so much more coming up.
[00:37:27.751 --> 00:37:43.399]  Before I go to Brock, Ron, Phil, Dylan, and others that are patiently holding, and then back into what the sun's up to with record solar activity and flares, very serious, and more on the situation in the Middle East that's unfolding.
[00:37:43.439 --> 00:37:47.541]  Now they're saying 24 dead Sunday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:47.801 --> 00:37:49.122]  So that number just keeps growing.
[00:37:50.803 --> 00:37:56.746]  But before I do that, I really want to encourage all of you to get my new video, The Matrix of Evil.
[00:37:57.461 --> 00:37:59.161]  Matrix of Evil is excellent.
[00:37:59.522 --> 00:38:01.782]  It is two hours, ten minutes long.
[00:38:03.042 --> 00:38:11.645]  We interview Congressman Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Congresswoman, former Congresswoman, Frank Morales, police state expert, Colonel Craig Roberts, expert on the New World Order.
[00:38:12.025 --> 00:38:14.225]  He talks about gun control, government-sponsored terror.
[00:38:14.585 --> 00:38:17.266]  There's excerpts of three of my latest and best speeches.
[00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:23.138]  An impassioned speech I gave before the Austin City Council right before they threw out the Patriot Act.
[00:38:23.678 --> 00:38:30.522]  Excerpts of myself on national TV on free speech television about a month ago where I received second place for Project Censored.
[00:38:30.562 --> 00:38:32.243]  I gave a really powerful speech there.
[00:38:32.263 --> 00:38:35.324]  Kind of a different film than what I put out in the past, but it's great.
[00:38:35.344 --> 00:38:38.866]  Got a lot of video clips, a lot of documents in it, little news clips.
[00:38:40.387 --> 00:38:41.327]  Matrix of Evil.
[00:38:41.347 --> 00:38:43.969]  It's got Ron Paul talking about the globalists setting up a depression.
[00:38:45.264 --> 00:38:48.026]  Talking about how those that are in Washington believe in global government.
[00:38:48.366 --> 00:38:54.330]  Cynthia McKinney talking about 9-11, government assassinations, government-run white slavery rings.
[00:38:55.331 --> 00:38:57.272]  It's really a great film.
[00:38:57.292 --> 00:38:57.972]  You need to have it.
[00:38:58.012 --> 00:39:00.614]  It'll wake a lot of people up from across the political spectrum.
[00:39:02.463 --> 00:39:03.823]  The Matrix of Evil, $25.95.
[00:39:05.163 --> 00:39:14.585]  But if you order three or more of any of my ten videos, whether it's Road to Tyranny, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, they drop down to $20 a piece.
[00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:23.527]  That is a $18 discount on a three-tape special, $24 discount on a four-tape special, $30 discount on a five-tape special, and so on.
[00:39:23.967 --> 00:39:28.847]  The new book is ordered out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror and the New World Order by Paul Watson.
[00:39:28.867 --> 00:39:31.168]  It's the best book out there on government-sponsored terror and 9-11 and
[00:39:32.518 --> 00:39:43.495]  Government sponsored terror in Israel, government sponsored terror in England, government sponsored terror in Russia, the Rothschilds being behind the UFO movement to create that false perception.
[00:39:44.873 --> 00:39:49.554]  It's a great book, 1995, over 300 pages, full of photos and diagrams and documents.
[00:39:49.574 --> 00:39:53.675]  You get a second book to give as a gift for only $11.95 when you get one of the books.
[00:39:54.015 --> 00:40:00.617]  And your support's needed, folks, for us to continue to write more books, to publish more books, to make more films.
[00:40:00.697 --> 00:40:04.538]  I mean, I was up working last night until midnight on another film.
[00:40:05.458 --> 00:40:08.759]  I'm just working around the clock here to fight the globalists.
[00:40:10.251 --> 00:40:20.760]  So please go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, link through to our secure online shopping cart, get the videos, get the books, give them as gifts to friends and families, as birthday presents.
[00:40:22.141 --> 00:40:23.282]  It's so important.
[00:40:23.342 --> 00:40:25.044]  Toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:40:25.064 --> 00:40:26.144]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:44.190]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, and I'm at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:48.791]  Or again, one more time, that phone number, 1-888-253-3139, or the websites.
[00:40:48.891 --> 00:40:50.331]  Please take action.
[00:40:50.371 --> 00:40:52.851]  The videos are waking people up en masse.
[00:40:53.011 --> 00:40:55.292]  Cynthia McKinney ran over, hugged me,
[00:41:09.211 --> 00:41:12.152]  Squealing with delight and said, you woke me up to the New World Order.
[00:41:12.192 --> 00:41:13.972]  And I'm like, get that camera on, get over here.
[00:41:13.992 --> 00:41:18.834]  And we did get some of it where she said it was a great film and Road to Tyranny was really powerful and dynamic.
[00:41:18.874 --> 00:41:20.334]  And, of course, that's in the video.
[00:41:20.634 --> 00:41:24.415]  But just the new one, Matrix of Evil, just showing you the effect these films have had.
[00:41:25.876 --> 00:41:28.477]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Brock in Canada.
[00:41:28.517 --> 00:41:29.777]  Brock, thanks for holding.
[00:41:29.797 --> 00:41:30.457]  You're on the air.
[00:41:31.157 --> 00:41:31.898]  Hello, Alex.
[00:41:32.038 --> 00:41:35.339]  I wanted to ask a couple of things.
[00:41:36.892 --> 00:41:39.753]  One of which, the World Trade Center bombings.
[00:41:40.333 --> 00:41:52.097]  The way I understand it, there's the Illuminati, a few of them in each government, so I guess they got together as a team and carried that out?
[00:41:52.117 --> 00:41:53.657]  Is that basically it?
[00:41:55.985 --> 00:42:03.471]  Their story, we know they funded, trained, protected, ordered FBI not to stop the supposed hijackers.
[00:42:03.491 --> 00:42:06.333]  We know the hijackers were, quote, trained at military bases.
[00:42:06.653 --> 00:42:11.978]  Then they went out to flight schools to create their dossiers, just to create the ledger, the fake trail.
[00:42:12.458 --> 00:42:22.041]  We know the public officials from Mayor Willie Brown to Salman Rushdie to Ashcroft, the chairman and joint chiefs of staff, were told not to fly to New York that week.
[00:42:22.421 --> 00:42:26.482]  We know that the head of Pakistan Intelligence wired 100,000 to Mohammed Atta.
[00:42:27.243 --> 00:42:33.325]  We know that he was meeting that morning with the heads of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as well as the director of the CIA.
[00:42:33.345 --> 00:42:37.926]  We know the CIA was running a drill of flying hijacked jets into buildings that morning, ordered NORAD to stand down.
[00:42:39.425 --> 00:42:41.486]  We know NORAD did stand down for an hour and a half.
[00:42:41.906 --> 00:42:43.326]  We know they've done all this.
[00:42:44.387 --> 00:42:46.187]  So we know they were involved.
[00:42:46.227 --> 00:42:50.749]  Then we look at their story of 19 guys with box cutters take over four airplanes.
[00:42:51.049 --> 00:42:56.251]  When you've got pretty tough airline pilots, former Marine Corps fighter pilots, one of them was.
[00:42:56.731 --> 00:42:57.651]  These are not wimps.
[00:42:57.691 --> 00:43:00.292]  They don't just give up their plane to a guy with a box cutter.
[00:43:00.872 --> 00:43:06.534]  And then you've got these maneuvers that even fighter races say they could only maybe achieve one out of five tries.
[00:43:07.656 --> 00:43:14.918]  Just amazing maneuvers happening going on because they have to concentrate and focus to bring a plane in right and land it on a big old runway.
[00:43:15.278 --> 00:43:20.319]  Imagine coming in, doing loops, coming in perfectly, T-boning buildings.
[00:43:21.559 --> 00:43:22.920]  And again, this is all on record.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.460]  The German technology minister has said only the U.S.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.360]  government could do this.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.001]  The British environment minister said the same thing.
[00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:31.008]  I mean, this is out there.
[00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:40.332]  Anybody who's got a high enough IQ to know the laws of gravity and physics and facts knows Building 7 fell faster than a bowling ball, than a lead ball.
[00:43:41.013 --> 00:43:45.775]  That could only happen if many of the bottom floors were disintegrated.
[00:43:47.035 --> 00:43:49.457]  So, I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:43:49.777 --> 00:43:52.138]  So we know their story is impossible.
[00:43:53.087 --> 00:43:58.211]  Okay, their story is the equivalent of Alex Jones sprouting wings and flying to Paris.
[00:43:59.011 --> 00:44:00.112]  It just didn't happen.
[00:44:00.673 --> 00:44:01.353]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:44:01.413 --> 00:44:02.734]  And then we have official U.S.
[00:44:02.754 --> 00:44:08.718]  government plans like Northwoods and PNAC and others to carry out terror attacks for political control.
[00:44:10.299 --> 00:44:20.827]  Well, I think that the next move, I mean, we look at what happened in Iraq a couple of days ago.
[00:44:21.423 --> 00:44:35.508]  And then almost instantly, the Congress and the House, the Senate, gave Bush that $87 billion that he was looking for right after the attack.
[00:44:35.608 --> 00:44:37.769]  I thought they would not give it to him.
[00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:43.631]  So it looks like when there's a crisis, Bush gets his way.
[00:44:43.951 --> 00:44:47.072]  Well, we know the bombing of the U.N.
[00:44:47.092 --> 00:44:47.913]  looks suspicious.
[00:44:47.973 --> 00:44:48.533]  We know...
[00:44:49.614 --> 00:44:52.195]  That Israel carries out bombings against Jews.
[00:44:52.855 --> 00:44:54.416]  This has been in her rots, folks.
[00:44:54.436 --> 00:44:56.016]  If you've got a problem with it, go tell them.
[00:44:56.497 --> 00:44:57.617]  Been in the Jerusalem Post.
[00:44:58.697 --> 00:45:05.280]  They do that because by killing their people, they get to keep control of the media, keep control of the population, continue the bulldozing of the settlements.
[00:45:06.082 --> 00:45:07.602]  Continuing building their settlements.
[00:45:08.063 --> 00:45:20.646]  We know that happens there, but this thing in Iraq, I think some of this is legitimate bombings because you do have the Shiites fighting with each other, fighting with the Sunnis, the Sunnis attacking, the Kurds killing each other and others.
[00:45:20.926 --> 00:45:23.687]  Some of the sniping and bombing and hand-grenading is real.
[00:45:24.707 --> 00:45:28.088]  Some of these coordinated attacks do look a little suspicious, but I'm not...
[00:45:28.871 --> 00:45:29.712]  We're good to go.
[00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:51.353]  But again, the Rothschilds control America, they control the Russians.
[00:45:51.773 --> 00:45:53.775]  This is the order out of chaos.
[00:45:54.195 --> 00:45:56.077]  Then it makes Europe look like the good cop.
[00:45:56.177 --> 00:45:56.917]  We fail.
[00:45:57.378 --> 00:46:00.901]  Europe and the UN come in and are the saviors in Iraq, okay?
[00:46:01.561 --> 00:46:08.467]  And the other thing I wanted to ask is what, if you could encapsulate it, what is going on in the Middle East?
[00:46:08.747 --> 00:46:11.970]  If you could just, you know, put it in a nutshell.
[00:46:13.328 --> 00:46:14.089]  We're good to go.
[00:46:14.209 --> 00:46:14.809]  We're good to go.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:44.463]  You've got all these interests that want it to continue, that want this to continue going on.
[00:46:44.563 --> 00:46:53.787]  So finally what you're going to see, and they're setting this up, is UN troop occupation, and they're discussing this, and American soldiers in the West Bank.
[00:46:54.547 --> 00:46:56.128]  And so that's where it ends.
[00:46:58.329 --> 00:46:59.189]  So it's all about...
[00:47:00.427 --> 00:47:00.647]  Yeah.
[00:47:15.667 --> 00:47:17.228]  You know, you tend to have corrupt people.
[00:47:17.428 --> 00:47:18.509]  That's the norm in power.
[00:47:18.949 --> 00:47:20.290]  I'm no fan of the Ayatollah.
[00:47:20.651 --> 00:47:21.711]  I'm no fan of Saddam.
[00:47:22.052 --> 00:47:23.653]  I'm no fan of Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:47:23.973 --> 00:47:26.174]  The point is, they're sovereign.
[00:47:26.214 --> 00:47:27.555]  They're not under globalist control.
[00:47:27.956 --> 00:47:29.337]  That's why they're going to get taken over.
[00:47:29.557 --> 00:47:33.019]  You've got a bigger Satan coming in to take over one of his demons.
[00:47:33.419 --> 00:47:37.762]  You've got a bigger mob boss taking over territory of rival gangs.
[00:47:38.043 --> 00:47:38.603]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:40.143 --> 00:47:41.404]  So that's what's happening here.
[00:47:41.504 --> 00:47:43.885]  People go, well, you're not for Saddam, are you?
[00:47:43.905 --> 00:47:45.346]  Well, no, I'm not for Saddam.
[00:47:45.386 --> 00:47:46.466]  But is this good for America?
[00:47:46.506 --> 00:47:47.627]  Is it good for the Iraqi people?
[00:47:47.707 --> 00:47:48.947]  No, it's good for the bankers.
[00:47:50.128 --> 00:47:53.129]  Were things better in Iraq, more secure, more stable under Saddam?
[00:47:53.189 --> 00:47:53.570]  Yes.
[00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:57.691]  When we had a different policy, that's why the globalists put him in.
[00:47:57.812 --> 00:47:59.993]  In 1958 as an assassin.
[00:48:00.273 --> 00:48:01.773]  1967 as the head of Ba'ath security.
[00:48:02.894 --> 00:48:04.695]  1976 as the dictator.
[00:48:05.435 --> 00:48:06.736]  He works for the bad boys.
[00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:10.280]  Okay, he works for the people now supposedly over there to save us.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.022]  Let's talk to Ron in New York, then Phil, Dylan, and others.
[00:48:14.122 --> 00:48:14.742]  Ron, go ahead.
[00:48:14.762 --> 00:48:15.763]  Hi, Alex.
[00:48:16.183 --> 00:48:16.543]  Welcome.
[00:48:16.763 --> 00:48:19.805]  I'm going to digress a moment, but then I want to get to the main point of my call.
[00:48:20.366 --> 00:48:22.807]  You mentioned the employment and the economic situation.
[00:48:22.827 --> 00:48:24.348]  There's a very easy way.
[00:48:25.225 --> 00:48:26.326]  To tell how that's going.
[00:48:26.866 --> 00:48:30.508]  Most of us in this day and age have relatives or friends around the country.
[00:48:30.568 --> 00:48:34.429]  America is not such a provincial type of society anymore.
[00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:48.256]  All you have to do is look at the way you're living and call three or four friends who live in different parts of the country, and you'll get a much clearer and accurate picture of how the economy and employment is going rather than watching CBS, NBC, or ABC lie to you about that.
[00:48:48.843 --> 00:48:50.124]  That's a very easy barometer.
[00:48:50.304 --> 00:49:03.570]  Well, there's record unemployment, record foreclosure, record people going into permanent long-term poverty, wrong word, long-term poverty, sustained real poverty, truly becoming poor, not just out of work at the time, which we've all been.
[00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.331]  At least I know I have before.
[00:49:05.351 --> 00:49:10.814]  I mean, I know I lived many years in a one-room apartment, and I enjoyed it.
[00:49:11.174 --> 00:49:14.896]  But the whole point is, boy, my life's a lot more complex now, the good old days.
[00:49:15.576 --> 00:49:18.538]  But it's horrible what's happening.
[00:49:18.638 --> 00:49:19.959]  Real wealth is disappearing.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.702]  And I look at my family, my whole family.
[00:49:24.142 --> 00:49:25.103]  They're living better.
[00:49:25.843 --> 00:49:32.208]  They were living better when they were 25, 30, 35 than the children are today.
[00:49:32.428 --> 00:49:33.028]  That's correct.
[00:49:33.408 --> 00:49:34.949]  And this is with education.
[00:49:34.989 --> 00:49:35.370]  Go ahead.
[00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:40.093]  And in addition, and I'm going to get off this topic and go to really what I called about.
[00:49:40.692 --> 00:49:51.596]  There was an article in last week's Daily News by an economic reporter named Lou Dobbs, in which he just cited what you said, that 1970, what would be our parents, had it better than we do today.
[00:49:51.976 --> 00:49:56.038]  There's something wrong with that when time goes forward, but social and living conditions go backward.
[00:49:56.358 --> 00:49:58.699]  And before, it was the complete opposite.
[00:49:58.719 --> 00:50:00.580]  Things were always getting better in America.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:01.180]  That's correct.
[00:50:01.741 --> 00:50:03.302]  Now, my main point is this.
[00:50:03.402 --> 00:50:06.084]  I went for a little trip into Manhattan yesterday.
[00:50:06.665 --> 00:50:13.150]  Midtown Manhattan, around the Rockefeller Center area, with its famous Grand Central Station, a very big Barnes & Noble store.
[00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:14.070]  Sir, let me stop you.
[00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:17.773]  You went to the Rothschild Gubernatorial Compound.
[00:50:18.794 --> 00:50:19.694]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[00:50:19.735 --> 00:50:20.335]  That's correct.
[00:50:20.435 --> 00:50:22.917]  And because of what I saw there, this amazed me.
[00:50:23.675 --> 00:50:30.906]  When I got off of the train at Grand Central Station, I saw people there who were handing out flyers who were opposed.
[00:50:31.587 --> 00:50:32.108]  I'm surprised.
[00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:33.851]  I never saw this there in my life.
[00:50:34.472 --> 00:50:36.876]  Who were opposed to the Patriot Act.
[00:50:37.546 --> 00:50:39.346]  They were shredding copies of the Constitution.
[00:50:39.367 --> 00:50:42.527]  They had a ladder, and they were telling people, this is what's happening to your civil rights.
[00:50:43.107 --> 00:50:43.628]  I went over.
[00:50:43.688 --> 00:50:44.388]  I spoke with them.
[00:50:44.868 --> 00:50:50.009]  They were opposed to the Patriot Act and a lot of things that were going on, but even they didn't know as much.
[00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:52.370]  They didn't know about the Victory Act and other subsequent laws.
[00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:56.451]  I was actually informing them, telling them, it is bad, and you're right to assume it's bad.
[00:50:56.491 --> 00:50:57.331]  Well, I'll tell you what, Ron.
[00:50:57.351 --> 00:50:58.812]  Inform us on the other side of this break.
[00:50:58.832 --> 00:51:01.172]  I'll let you have a minute or so on the other side to finish up your story.
[00:51:01.192 --> 00:51:01.732]  I want to hear it.
[00:51:02.193 --> 00:51:03.613]  We're going to fill Dylan and others.
[00:51:04.354 --> 00:51:05.176]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:10.916 --> 00:51:11.356]  We're good to go.
[00:51:34.637 --> 00:51:51.593]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones.
[00:51:53.454 --> 00:51:57.655]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[00:51:57.815 --> 00:52:01.976]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:01.996 --> 00:52:02.697]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:52:10.322 --> 00:52:14.687]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:52:14.867 --> 00:52:19.273]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:52:19.433 --> 00:52:23.798]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:52:23.858 --> 00:52:25.179]  The New World Order.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:26.961]  Pan emerged.
[00:52:26.982 --> 00:52:31.206]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:52:31.266 --> 00:52:38.214]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:52:38.334 --> 00:52:40.337]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:52:40.717 --> 00:52:51.039]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:52:51.319 --> 00:52:56.680]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:53:09.662 --> 00:53:10.483]  Oh my God!
[00:53:10.743 --> 00:53:15.467]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:53:15.748 --> 00:53:16.408]  Yes, it's true.
[00:53:16.508 --> 00:53:19.211]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:53:19.351 --> 00:53:23.375]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:53:23.495 --> 00:53:24.035]  You heard it right.
[00:53:24.215 --> 00:53:29.240]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.821]  You may miss out forever.
[00:53:47.534 --> 00:53:48.094]  We're good to go.
[00:54:18.603 --> 00:54:19.984]  We're good to go.
[00:54:29.679 --> 00:54:31.600]  You're down there at the capital of the United States.
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:32.980]  Let's just start being honest about stuff.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:40.523]  You're at the capital of the United States, the dictatorship command base, and you saw folks out speaking out against the Patriot Act.
[00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:40.943]  Go ahead.
[00:54:41.283 --> 00:54:44.024]  Yes, I did, right there in Grand Central Station.
[00:54:44.693 --> 00:54:45.534]  We're good to go.
[00:54:45.554 --> 00:54:46.374]  We're good to go.
[00:55:09.608 --> 00:55:11.630]  Into your emails and things you do online.
[00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:16.433]  Now, I go to the Barnes & Noble bookstore, which is right in Rockefeller Center.
[00:55:16.453 --> 00:55:18.294]  I think it's their flagship store nationally.
[00:55:19.135 --> 00:55:21.696]  And I see something I never expected to see.
[00:55:22.377 --> 00:55:23.578]  They have a magazine rack.
[00:55:24.118 --> 00:55:29.542]  On a magazine rack, not hidden, but out there, is a magazine, The Free American, which I'm sure you're familiar with.
[00:55:29.662 --> 00:55:35.806]  I would never think a publication like that would be on a rack in a Barnes & Noble bookstore right in Rockefeller Center.
[00:55:36.587 --> 00:55:36.967]  I'm then...
[00:55:38.354 --> 00:55:42.035]  Talking to some of the book dealers in the place.
[00:55:42.055 --> 00:55:45.036]  They even had these bumper stickers from, I forget his name, Michael Morris.
[00:55:45.076 --> 00:55:46.077]  Hey, dude, where's my country?
[00:55:46.857 --> 00:55:52.719]  And I'll tell you, it was amazing that these book dealers were, like, really opposed to the Patriot Act.
[00:55:52.779 --> 00:55:54.920]  I'm like, wow, this kind of reaction.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.821]  Yeah, the key is, here's the problem.
[00:55:56.841 --> 00:55:58.381]  They're going to let that resistance build up.
[00:55:58.401 --> 00:56:01.983]  Then they're going to blow more stuff up and say, see, you tied our hands.
[00:56:02.363 --> 00:56:04.423]  Now we're taking all your rights for your own good.
[00:56:04.683 --> 00:56:05.504]  But thank you for the call.
[00:56:05.524 --> 00:56:05.784]  Hold on.
[00:56:06.304 --> 00:56:07.164]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:56:07.624 --> 00:56:17.607]  In that magazine, there's a photograph of Warren Buffett, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Lord Rothschild together in England just before the California... The color photo of that's on Prison Planet and Infowars.
[00:56:17.647 --> 00:56:18.367]  Got to let you go.
[00:56:18.787 --> 00:56:19.367]  Got to let you go.
[00:56:19.427 --> 00:56:21.468]  Really appreciate your call.
[00:56:22.588 --> 00:56:33.091]  What the globalists don't want on the magazine racks is something that doesn't attack everybody's race or everybody's color, but brings everybody together against the New World Order.
[00:56:34.443 --> 00:56:34.884]  We're good to go.
[00:56:50.015 --> 00:57:00.020]  Arnold and Lord Jacob Rothschild and Warren Buffett together on September 24, 2002, getting their walking orders for the election.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:07.363]  Just go to InfoWars.com, and it's in the New Order Elite Has Big Plans for Schwarzenegger article right there.
[00:57:07.704 --> 00:57:08.984]  Okay, I want to get to the other calls.
[00:57:09.364 --> 00:57:11.165]  Phil in Omaha, thanks for holding, sir.
[00:57:11.185 --> 00:57:11.565]  Go ahead.
[00:57:12.006 --> 00:57:14.607]  All right, now I don't want you to filibuster me, Alex.
[00:57:15.447 --> 00:57:16.788]  I'm going to read something to you.
[00:57:18.067 --> 00:57:24.712]  Out of the Junior Jewish Encyclopedia, 4th edition, 1961.
[00:57:25.393 --> 00:57:25.974]  Are you ready?
[00:57:27.315 --> 00:57:28.756]  Well, I'm not allowed to talk, you just said.
[00:57:29.076 --> 00:57:32.899]  House of Rothschild, bankers and philanthropists.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:39.965]  Founder of one of Europe's greatest banking firms, Meyer Amschel Rothschild was the son of a German Jewish merchant.
[00:57:40.842 --> 00:57:44.983]  Meyer entered banking when he agreed to invest the fortune of an Austrian nobleman.
[00:57:45.063 --> 00:57:50.905]  He was so successful that he soon found himself in charge of the finances of several royal families.
[00:57:51.685 --> 00:57:58.447]  At his death, he bequest his five sons a banking establishment with enormous assets and branches in several financial centers.
[00:57:59.107 --> 00:58:03.548]  Eldest son, Anselm Meyer, became the head of the Frankfurt Bank.
[00:58:03.608 --> 00:58:05.849]  Solomon Meyer, head of the Vienna establishment.
[00:58:06.494 --> 00:58:13.159]  Nathan Meyer, the London Bank, Carl Meyer, the Naples Bank, and Jacob Meyer founded and headed a Paris Bank.
[00:58:13.799 --> 00:58:21.305]  Because of the extent of the Rothschild family undertakings, they became known as the financial kings of Europe.
[00:58:21.749 --> 00:58:22.270]  Yeah, they stop war.
[00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:22.930]  Isn't that nice?
[00:58:42.803 --> 00:58:43.504]  Interesting, Phil.
[00:58:43.544 --> 00:58:44.084]  Anything else?
[00:58:44.525 --> 00:58:44.865]  Yeah.
[00:58:45.205 --> 00:58:51.190]  Later generations of the Rothschild family gained prominence as patrons of the arts and philanthropists.
[00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:51.770]  You know what?
[00:58:51.791 --> 00:58:52.411]  You're going to have to hold.
[00:58:52.431 --> 00:58:53.011]  We've got a break.
[00:58:53.792 --> 00:58:59.096]  Second hour coming up, and we'll talk more to Phil and others.
[00:58:59.116 --> 00:58:59.577]  Stay with us.
[00:59:01.318 --> 00:59:09.925]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:59:10.145 --> 00:59:11.807]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing...
[00:59:15.467 --> 00:59:18.348]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:22.148 --> 00:59:26.429]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:45.772 --> 00:59:53.054]  The sun is acting in more and more of a bizarre fashion with super ejections on almost a daily basis.
[00:59:53.094 --> 00:59:53.854]  Now we'll get into that.
[00:59:53.874 --> 00:59:55.654]  A bunch of news on the economy.
[00:59:57.315 --> 00:59:59.235]  The story out of the Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:59:59.275 --> 01:00:02.636]  If you protest in any way the government or any other government, you're arrested.
[01:00:02.676 --> 01:00:04.116]  No protesting is allowed in Australia.
[01:00:04.997 --> 01:00:06.177]  That's your so-called freedom.
[01:00:07.226 --> 01:00:07.947]  That's coming up.
[01:00:08.007 --> 01:00:17.034]  But last hour I read an article out of ITAR Toss and several others, London Independent, about the Rothschilds buying up all the rest of the TV and media in England.
[01:00:18.375 --> 01:00:24.099]  They have this Russian, the richest man in Russia supposedly, just like Warren Buffett's so rich, but he's a Rothschild agent.
[01:00:24.739 --> 01:00:28.042]  He got arrested by Putin and now things were transferred over to the Rothschilds.
[01:00:29.166 --> 01:00:33.355]  And, yeah, this is a very powerful, probably the most powerful family in the New World Order.
[01:00:33.375 --> 01:00:37.766]  Then you've got the German side of it with the Sachs, Kober, Goethes, the British Royal Family, and others.
[01:00:40.658 --> 01:00:45.882]  Phil in Omaha was reading out of an encyclopedia, I think he was reading a Jewish encyclopedia, about the Rothschilds.
[01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:53.148]  And we should know who the Rothschilds are because they funded a lot of people like Hitler and Stalin and Mao.
[01:00:53.888 --> 01:00:56.470]  And it's a very, very serious group of people.
[01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:59.733]  And they were behind Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Nazi, as well.
[01:00:59.853 --> 01:01:02.275]  So go ahead and finish up your points there, Phil.
[01:01:02.295 --> 01:01:07.439]  All right, it says, it goes on to say, and this is the Junior Jewish Encyclopedia, 4th edition, 1961.
[01:01:09.073 --> 01:01:14.203]  Later generations of the Rothschild family gained prominence as patrons of the arts and philanthropists.
[01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:23.885]  Outstanding among them was Baron Edmund D. Rothschild, who became one of the chief architects of modern Palestine.
[01:01:24.465 --> 01:01:30.968]  Anonymously, at first, he poured millions into the support of the early agricultural settlements in Palestine.
[01:01:31.428 --> 01:01:43.153]  In fact, for about 15 years, from the 1890s to 1905, most Jewish colonists were directly dependent on the Baron, or the well-known benefactor, as he was known.
[01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:48.265]  Now, so, he was one of the first Zionists, Jewish Zionists.
[01:01:48.986 --> 01:01:53.708]  And, you know, if they can prevent loans to warlike governments, they can also grant them.
[01:01:54.341 --> 01:01:58.183]  By stopping credit, they can also strangle a country.
[01:01:58.203 --> 01:02:11.369]  Well, I mean, obviously that encyclopedia is going to be positive about the family, but that part about them, I mean, mainstream history books admit the Rothschilds bragged that they would fund both sides, start wars to make money.
[01:02:11.609 --> 01:02:17.832]  For them to claim that they were out stopping war is like saying Stalin was out fighting communism.
[01:02:18.212 --> 01:02:19.993]  Well, see, here's the thing, Alex.
[01:02:20.553 --> 01:02:21.694]  But here's the difference.
[01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:37.590]  Here's the difference.
[01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:43.353]  They did nothing while Ford and GM and the rest of them were running the slave camps, killing Jews and others.
[01:02:43.733 --> 01:02:47.935]  They're supporting Arnold, who campaigned for a known Nazi and said, I don't care if he's a Nazi.
[01:02:48.235 --> 01:02:50.876]  Arnold says he wants to be like, quote, Hitler.
[01:02:51.016 --> 01:02:52.436]  Well, wait a second, Alex.
[01:02:52.476 --> 01:02:52.997]  Let me finish.
[01:02:53.177 --> 01:02:53.677]  Let me talk.
[01:02:53.697 --> 01:02:55.357]  Because you've been talking for two and a half minutes.
[01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:56.258]  I need to say something here.
[01:02:56.578 --> 01:02:57.218]  I'm letting you talk.
[01:02:57.438 --> 01:02:57.698]  Okay.
[01:02:57.798 --> 01:03:01.560]  I want that on the record, Phil, that I've had you on for two segments now, and I'm letting you talk.
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.401]  But this is going to go both ways.
[01:03:03.461 --> 01:03:04.481]  I appreciate what you're saying.
[01:03:05.002 --> 01:03:11.245]  My point is that people say, oh, well, it's all the Jews, or it's all the blacks, or it's all the whites, or it's all the Mexicans.
[01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:13.766]  No, it's evil people in all these groups.
[01:03:14.246 --> 01:03:18.068]  Yes, they're powerful Jews in the New World Order, and I'm telling you they could care less about Jews.
[01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:23.070]  They care about world government, and they funded Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:23.550]  Go ahead.
[01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:28.733]  Well, now, I know a person personally that was in the basement...
[01:03:29.657 --> 01:03:31.980]  Of Warren Buffett's father's store.
[01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.042]  Here in Omaha.
[01:03:34.703 --> 01:03:35.083]  Okay?
[01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:37.766]  Warren Buffett's father was a congressman.
[01:03:38.407 --> 01:03:39.348]  And he had a store.
[01:03:39.809 --> 01:03:43.753]  And in the basement, there were all these books, Alex.
[01:03:44.614 --> 01:03:46.296]  And guess what these books were about?
[01:03:48.398 --> 01:03:49.760]  Jewish Banking.
[01:03:52.179 --> 01:03:52.579]  Okay?
[01:03:53.219 --> 01:03:56.561]  Well, I know that Warren Buffett is an agent of the Rothschilds.
[01:03:56.601 --> 01:03:57.161]  That's admitted.
[01:03:57.341 --> 01:04:00.422]  Well, and he's probably just a benefactor.
[01:04:00.762 --> 01:04:02.343]  Probably isn't worth $30 billion.
[01:04:02.403 --> 01:04:03.763]  Probably $3 or $4 billion.
[01:04:03.783 --> 01:04:04.964]  Well, it's like this Russian.
[01:04:05.264 --> 01:04:07.925]  The richest guy in Russia gets arrested and the Rothschilds take over.
[01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:10.726]  I mean, they've always run Russia.
[01:04:11.686 --> 01:04:13.687]  And that's what I've been trying to say here.
[01:04:13.727 --> 01:04:15.087]  But they support Nazis.
[01:04:15.607 --> 01:04:17.328]  They don't have a way to deal with that, see?
[01:04:18.288 --> 01:04:18.949]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:19.009 --> 01:04:19.809]  Thanks for the call, Phil.
[01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:26.701]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:26.881 --> 01:04:31.304]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:31.464 --> 01:04:35.827]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:04:35.947 --> 01:04:37.208]  A New World Order.
[01:04:37.988 --> 01:04:38.989]  Can emerge.
[01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:43.234]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:43.294 --> 01:04:50.222]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:50.362 --> 01:04:52.365]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:52.745 --> 01:05:03.073]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:03.353 --> 01:05:08.717]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:06:23.327 --> 01:06:29.071]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:06:29.332 --> 01:06:34.456]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:06:34.796 --> 01:06:44.084]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:06:44.424 --> 01:06:49.367]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:06:49.707 --> 01:06:53.730]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:58.713]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:06:59.053 --> 01:07:04.937]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:07:25.306 --> 01:07:28.087]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:32.111 --> 01:07:38.135]  All right, folks, already eight minutes and 12 seconds into the second hour of global transmission against tyranny.
[01:07:39.076 --> 01:07:42.858]  We're trying to get your head outside the box, get you to think for yourself.
[01:07:43.478 --> 01:07:45.920]  Going back to the calls, into more of the news here in just a moment.
[01:07:46.761 --> 01:07:48.842]  Dylan in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:07:48.882 --> 01:07:49.302]  Go ahead.
[01:07:50.683 --> 01:07:52.224]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:07:52.344 --> 01:07:53.745]  Thank you for being of service today.
[01:07:54.526 --> 01:07:56.267]  I'd like to comment on...
[01:07:57.396 --> 01:08:03.078]  One item you were talking about earlier regarding Australia, regarding our Second Amendment gun rights.
[01:08:05.259 --> 01:08:11.542]  Anywhere where there's total gun control, I consider that to be martial law.
[01:08:11.622 --> 01:08:12.462]  Don't you, Alex?
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:23.009]  Yes, that is the key, strongest indicator or definition of being in a tyranny, is if you are disarmed, you are a slave.
[01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:26.853]  Slaves are barred defending themselves.
[01:08:26.993 --> 01:08:29.856]  Slaves are barred owning weapons.
[01:08:29.936 --> 01:08:33.840]  It was the same in Spartacus' time or for a black slave on a plantation.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.883]  And when a human being can't have a weapon, they're a slave, bottom line.
[01:08:39.824 --> 01:08:45.367]  Okay, I would just like to point out Public Law 87-297, Arms Control and Disarmament Act.
[01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:47.669]  1962 passed into public law.
[01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:50.130]  Yeah, and it was presented to the UN in 1962 as well.
[01:08:58.096 --> 01:09:03.440]  This is Title 22, United States Code, Section 2551.
[01:09:03.861 --> 01:09:05.722]  Yeah, give that bill number out again.
[01:09:05.742 --> 01:09:06.603]  And, of course, the U.N.
[01:09:06.623 --> 01:09:07.464]  version is 7277.
[01:09:08.045 --> 01:09:13.710]  But give that bill number out again, the plan to disarm us, then the police, then bring in foreign troops.
[01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.973]  Okay, well, I know the law number, public law, 87-297.
[01:09:17.493 --> 01:09:20.596]  And you can't find this on fine law.
[01:09:21.092 --> 01:09:23.973]  There will be articles on it if you pull it up on Google.
[01:09:24.353 --> 01:09:31.434]  One of these articles recommends going to the library to look up the 25-book set of the United States Show.
[01:09:31.454 --> 01:09:32.955]  I have the original bill from 1962.
[01:09:33.455 --> 01:09:45.878]  I'd like to report something I don't have written documentation on, reported on yesterday by Brother Officer Jack McClam, retired policeman, war veteran, Jack McClam.
[01:09:46.425 --> 01:09:47.846]  Yeah, we've had him on about 50 times.
[01:09:48.507 --> 01:10:00.398]  He reported the National Associations of Chief of Police and American Federation of Police participated in a poll from 17,000 city, county, and state.
[01:10:00.879 --> 01:10:04.342]  And 91% of police said they're against gun control.
[01:10:05.323 --> 01:10:05.683]  Yes.
[01:10:07.673 --> 01:10:11.916]  I took that 90% did not agree that banning of any firearm... 91.
[01:10:13.197 --> 01:10:14.818]  Sir, I have the poll right here in front of me.
[01:10:14.838 --> 01:10:15.859]  It is an official poll.
[01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:19.601]  They're trying to suppress it, but it was in the Associated Press.
[01:10:19.621 --> 01:10:19.601]  91%.
[01:10:20.542 --> 01:10:22.523]  And thanks for reminding me of that.
[01:10:22.543 --> 01:10:24.725]  I've got to get that posted on InfoWars.
[01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:34.031]  I had 86% did not agree that the Second Amendment was put into the Constitution so people could go hunting and target to the target range.
[01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:35.792]  They cited reasons...
[01:10:36.721 --> 01:10:53.066]  For the Second Amendment to the Constitution, for the defense of one's self and one's property, and also for the defense of this nation from all enemies, foreign and domestic, and for the defense of the republic.
[01:10:54.232 --> 01:10:58.376]  Well, sounds to me like the FBI training manuals aren't brainwashing the police.
[01:10:58.456 --> 01:11:01.258]  I mean, I knew that 60% of cops were good on average.
[01:11:02.059 --> 01:11:03.440]  And this wasn't street police.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.981]  This wasn't street police.
[01:11:05.041 --> 01:11:06.723]  This was the higher echelon.
[01:11:07.043 --> 01:11:11.727]  Well, that's because it was a private poll that was done without having to put their name on it.
[01:11:12.127 --> 01:11:19.653]  What happens is the feds come in and they tell them, if you want this federal grant, come stand behind us at a press conference against guns.
[01:11:19.693 --> 01:11:20.694]  And they go out and do it.
[01:11:20.995 --> 01:11:22.676]  The mayors order them to do it.
[01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:26.871]  I know one thing.
[01:11:26.911 --> 01:11:32.036]  If it had been the street police, the percentages would have even been a lot higher, usually about 99%.
[01:11:33.457 --> 01:11:38.602]  Well, I'll tell you, if 99% of the police said I couldn't own a gun, I still got a God-given right because I'm not their slave.
[01:11:38.642 --> 01:11:40.464]  But yes, I was shocked by 91%. 74%.
[01:11:43.627 --> 01:11:54.358]  No, 76% in major government polls, and then even some of the private ones that have been done, going back to 29 palms, but it's in the high 70s, say they won't serve the UN, won't confiscate guns in America.
[01:11:54.899 --> 01:11:58.703]  The 20-something percent that say yes get promoted and are used domestically.
[01:11:59.103 --> 01:12:04.449]  The others get sent overseas to be used as cannon fodder, given deadly vaccines, huffed, depleted uranium.
[01:12:06.383 --> 01:12:12.508]  I was shocked to hear that 91% of police are against gun control.
[01:12:12.588 --> 01:12:15.551]  That is very, very exciting, and that is a prestigious poll.
[01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:29.923]  Well, I think it really just ties into your article that you brought up about... Sounds like your phone's having some problems.
[01:12:30.363 --> 01:12:31.284]  Are you on a cell phone?
[01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:33.666]  You just dropped off.
[01:12:34.552 --> 01:12:36.694]  I believe you were going to say that ties into Australia.
[01:12:36.714 --> 01:12:38.075]  Let me read this article now.
[01:12:39.976 --> 01:12:46.261]  Anti-war activists charged for misusing phone to protest U.S.
[01:12:47.042 --> 01:12:52.846]  Now, again, type in Australia bans protests in a search engine.
[01:12:52.866 --> 01:12:56.970]  You'll get Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, ABC News, Australia.
[01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:58.691]  I mean, we covered this a year and a half ago.
[01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:07.354]  And they said, this was in the news, we read the articles, they said, if you are out protesting, troops have been ordered to shoot you and kill you.
[01:13:08.115 --> 01:13:12.177]  Now, I don't care how crazy that sounds, that's what the government said.
[01:13:12.197 --> 01:13:23.862]  And this is, of course, five years after banning their guns and the crime rate exploding 300%, and all those numbers are out from the Bureau of Statistical Data and Analysis of the Commonwealth of Australia.
[01:13:24.594 --> 01:13:26.515]  He posted all that on Infowars.com.
[01:13:26.555 --> 01:13:29.176]  Just type in Australian gun statistics in the search engine.
[01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:32.017]  It should pop up for you from three or four years ago on the website.
[01:13:33.498 --> 01:13:38.380]  Anti-war activists charged for misusing phone to protest to U.S.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:42.121]  Now, people still come out and protest, despite the fact they've been threatened with being shot.
[01:13:42.581 --> 01:13:43.882]  The troops have refused to shoot them.
[01:13:45.117 --> 01:13:51.420]  An Auckland peace activist, that's one of the states of Australia, an Auckland peace activist who sent an email to U.S.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:56.623]  Embassy objecting to the war on Iraq has been charged with misuse of a cell phone.
[01:13:58.436 --> 01:14:09.006]  Police went to Ebsom home of university student Bruce Hubbard, 38, yesterday afternoon and took him to Takupanuna police station for questioning.
[01:14:09.046 --> 01:14:18.835]  Mr. Hubbard last night said he had been charged under the Total Communications Act and had been told by police that they would seize information from his computer under the Counterterrorism Act.
[01:14:20.797 --> 01:14:21.178]  Friends...
[01:14:22.131 --> 01:14:28.054]  Such as fellow activist John Mento were alerted to Hubbard's plight when he sent an email before being taken to the police station.
[01:14:28.534 --> 01:14:36.658]  A spokesman for Takapuna Police confirmed Hubbard had been charged and was on bail, but was unable to confirm the charge.
[01:14:36.978 --> 01:14:40.280]  Mr. Mento said Hubbard sent the embassy an email in about March.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:47.263]  Hubbard is a member of the left-wing group Global Peace and Justice, Students for Justice in Ballestine, and the Green Party.
[01:14:48.144 --> 01:14:50.705]  And he has every right as a human being to be in that group.
[01:14:51.463 --> 01:14:57.207]  In January, he helped organize a protest against the deployment of a frigate, Temena, to aid U.S.
[01:14:57.247 --> 01:14:58.548]  forces in the Middle East.
[01:14:59.029 --> 01:15:05.333]  He has also been outspoken on the treatment of Algerian asylum seeker Ahmed Zawani.
[01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:09.396]  Hubbard is due to appear in North Shore District Court on Monday.
[01:15:10.257 --> 01:15:13.880]  Now, I typed in this headline, got some other articles, and they elaborate.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:20.745]  It is illegal to send an email to any embassy or to anyone against the war protesting.
[01:15:22.353 --> 01:15:23.954]  It is against the law to organize.
[01:15:23.994 --> 01:15:27.835]  It is against the law to have protests of any type in Australia.
[01:15:29.856 --> 01:15:36.119]  And they tried to say a year and a half ago that they were authorizing the police and military to, quote, shoot to kill anyone protesting.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.061]  Now, folks, this is mainstream news.
[01:15:41.601 --> 01:15:45.643]  I told my wife to put a flashback up on this, some of the old articles on it, because she wouldn't believe it.
[01:15:45.663 --> 01:15:47.904]  I don't know if she did, but they're not on Infowars.com.
[01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:54.464]  We'll get them up there, the older articles, or just type in Australia bans protest and prepare yourself.
[01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:58.365]  Now, I'm sure you heard about England last year.
[01:15:58.425 --> 01:16:09.869]  We had the host of A Man and His Dog, a popular rural affairs show that was on the air for six years, on the show, and he gave a speech about how they were taking people's land.
[01:16:09.909 --> 01:16:14.711]  He said, why don't rural groups have the same rights as homosexuals,
[01:16:16.025 --> 01:16:18.366]  Or foreigners, or gays.
[01:16:18.386 --> 01:16:19.426]  He even said gay.
[01:16:20.427 --> 01:16:25.668]  But he also said the word homosexual, and Scotland Yard Diversity Unit says that's a hate word.
[01:16:25.708 --> 01:16:26.929]  I thought it was a scientific word.
[01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:30.850]  Heterosexual, homosexual, Anglo, Negro.
[01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:32.851]  These are just scientific terms.
[01:16:32.871 --> 01:16:36.152]  But again, they take on, if they say they're hateful, they're hateful.
[01:16:38.213 --> 01:16:41.074]  And he was arrested by Scotland Yard Diversity Unit, folks.
[01:16:41.114 --> 01:16:42.314]  He was taken to jail.
[01:16:44.292 --> 01:16:51.620]  Because he said the word homosexual, and the head of the Scotland Yard Diversity Unit said, the word homosexual is unacceptable, you will be arrested.
[01:16:55.504 --> 01:17:07.556]  So, all over the place this is happening, all over the place, just stuff right out of the Soviet Union, but it's always for the environment, or it's always to stop violence, there can't be a protest, because there might be violence, or...
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:20.644]  Well, you saw in the takeover that I made in 2000, late 99, first 30 minutes of the video is local newscast, amateur video news articles, where the police say no protest, no anti-WTO pins in the city.
[01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:26.266]  They pull people's cars over, search, they find a little button, they take it away, arrest you, spray mace in your face.
[01:17:27.926 --> 01:17:35.909]  And the cops say, hey, we had some violence at the march, and so there's no protesting allowed anywhere, and I'm taking, I've got to search your bag to see if there's any anti-WTO literature.
[01:17:37.864 --> 01:17:39.045]  And they said, what about the First Amendment?
[01:17:39.085 --> 01:17:42.227]  And the cops go, not after what happened in our city yesterday.
[01:17:42.247 --> 01:17:44.849]  It's for your own good.
[01:17:44.869 --> 01:17:55.236]  And of course, the 50 thugs that set the trash cans on fire, hit cops with beer bottles, knocked out windows, were hired by the Delta Force, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and Seattle Weekly.
[01:17:56.647 --> 01:17:57.407]  In the story, by the way.
[01:17:57.887 --> 01:18:00.788]  And then we have police admitting they were ordered not to stop the vandals.
[01:18:01.068 --> 01:18:08.370]  They were then housed in a government building, a four-story building, had food catered in, everything for them.
[01:18:14.351 --> 01:18:16.892]  So that's the reality, folks.
[01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:17.472]  It's simple.
[01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:22.433]  They have some thugs burn some trash cans, they protect them right in front of you, and then you don't have a right to protest.
[01:18:23.074 --> 01:18:24.954]  Well, the same thing's happened in Australia.
[01:18:26.641 --> 01:18:27.782]  And I just read you the article.
[01:18:28.082 --> 01:18:32.384]  You're not allowed to protest or organize protests in Australia.
[01:18:32.824 --> 01:18:35.205]  It was such a free country just 20, 30 years ago.
[01:18:35.225 --> 01:18:42.149]  It was so free that Hutton Gibson moved his family, Mel, and others out there in 1968 to keep away from the Vietnam War.
[01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:45.611]  There's nowhere to run now.
[01:18:45.871 --> 01:18:50.073]  The eye of the Dark Lord, the New World Order, is upon everything.
[01:18:52.122 --> 01:18:53.963]  The darkness has spread across the globe.
[01:18:53.983 --> 01:18:55.543]  We've got to stand up and fight this.
[01:18:55.563 --> 01:18:59.585]  We've got to roll up our sleeves, engage the enemy, end the Infowar now.
[01:18:59.645 --> 01:19:00.926]  Their crimes are legion.
[01:19:01.466 --> 01:19:06.428]  All we need to do is expose their crimes, Joe Sixpack and Sally Sockerman.
[01:19:08.889 --> 01:19:10.590]  All right, thanks for bringing that up, Dylan.
[01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:12.030]  You just got me really fired up.
[01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:19.713]  Yeah, I've got the story about the 91% being against gun control, 86% saying it's not for hunting, it's for self-defense.
[01:19:19.733 --> 01:19:21.074]  We'll come back and talk to others.
[01:19:22.541 --> 01:19:33.264]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.

[01:22:25.077 --> 01:22:26.557]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[01:22:59.434 --> 01:22:59.654]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:23.237 --> 01:23:26.019]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:29.922]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:33.225 --> 01:23:35.247]  All right, let's go straight to these calls and quickly.
[01:23:35.507 --> 01:23:37.649]  Jim in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:23:37.689 --> 01:23:38.129]  Go ahead.
[01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:41.272]  Good to talk to you, my friend.
[01:23:41.372 --> 01:23:41.672]  Welcome.
[01:23:42.475 --> 01:23:43.376]  I give you an example.
[01:23:43.396 --> 01:23:44.616]  Here's what Jesus said.
[01:23:44.636 --> 01:23:44.856]  September 7, 1985.
[01:23:45.176 --> 01:23:47.397]  My child and my children, I must confess,
[01:24:08.287 --> 01:24:14.069]  Also warn you that my mother cannot be taken lightly in what she has just given you as knowledge of the KGB.
[01:24:14.409 --> 01:24:17.631]  They are now holding the major stations in your government.
[01:24:18.151 --> 01:24:18.891]  That was September 7, 1985.
[01:24:19.371 --> 01:24:25.914]  And it says, another one here, about England.
[01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:29.855]  I see a power, England, but I cannot fully understand the involvement with Satan.
[01:24:29.895 --> 01:24:31.036]  They pretend to be friends.
[01:24:31.556 --> 01:24:32.856]  It is a conspiracy.
[01:24:32.876 --> 01:24:33.937]  They are to be watched.
[01:24:35.763 --> 01:24:38.626]  It is the uniting of the forces to destroy the United States.
[01:24:38.666 --> 01:24:44.472]  They're doing their work so well so far, but a blessed mother stresses the power of prayer to hold back the darkness.
[01:24:44.492 --> 01:24:46.494]  That was December 24, 1970.
[01:24:47.755 --> 01:24:49.036]  And here's one.
[01:24:49.136 --> 01:24:50.177]  Consecrate Russia.
[01:24:50.297 --> 01:24:52.740]  Unless the bishops and the Holy Father in unity...
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:25:07.230]  With all the bishops in the world, unless they consecrate Russia to my mother's Immaculate Heart, that's for the blasphemies against her, the world will be doomed because Russia will continue to spread her errors throughout the world, rising up wars and carnage and pestilence and famine.
[01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:09.031]  Is this what you want, my children?
[01:25:09.091 --> 01:25:10.952]  Jesus Christ, June 17, 1989.
[01:25:13.394 --> 01:25:23.023]  United Nations, America, you will remove yourself as a country from the brood of vipers in your city that has set itself up to govern the world's peoples and lead them to destruction.
[01:25:23.403 --> 01:25:24.284]  Our Lady, December 7, 1971.
[01:25:25.124 --> 01:25:28.627]  25 years of apparition.
[01:25:28.688 --> 01:25:31.430]  Sir, if I let you just read and read and read, everybody else will want to do it.
[01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:32.531]  Anything else on your mind?
[01:25:33.058 --> 01:25:34.739]  Well, it's all in there.
[01:25:34.759 --> 01:25:39.802]  And I sent you the book of 10 years of those prophecies where she was talking to Veronica Lucan for 25 years.
[01:25:40.303 --> 01:25:40.743]  And St.
[01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:47.768]  Teresa, Father Coghlan's saint, the little flower, appeared to her for the previous two years before that.
[01:25:47.808 --> 01:25:49.789]  So there's 27 years of apparitions.
[01:25:50.369 --> 01:25:54.012]  And showed her miracles so she knew it wasn't coming from Satan.
[01:25:54.552 --> 01:25:54.912]  All right.
[01:25:55.192 --> 01:25:57.174]  Well, thank you so much for the call.
[01:25:57.754 --> 01:25:59.175]  Let's talk to Jim in Indiana.
[01:25:59.235 --> 01:26:00.096]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:26:00.136 --> 01:26:00.576]  Go ahead.
[01:26:01.576 --> 01:26:01.816]  Alex?
[01:26:02.237 --> 01:26:02.537]  Yes.
[01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:08.402]  Okay, I was going to read a couple things here to you, but it looks like it's read day here, so I'm just going to do something here real quick here for you.
[01:26:09.483 --> 01:26:10.684]  I want to get to a point here.
[01:26:10.864 --> 01:26:16.509]  In every stage of this oppression, we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms.
[01:26:17.249 --> 01:26:20.332]  Our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.
[01:26:21.095 --> 01:26:26.357]  Now, what I want to cover on that, the point I want to get to... And that's from the Declaration of Independence.
[01:26:26.397 --> 01:26:26.717]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:26.937 --> 01:26:31.358]  And with the Supreme Court, you're aware, I guess, and I've heard you on your radio.
[01:26:31.418 --> 01:26:39.221]  Yeah, they said they're not going to hear the case on the Ten Commandments, and they're saying they're going to follow the orders of the United Nations.
[01:26:39.241 --> 01:26:39.901]  That's official.
[01:26:40.261 --> 01:26:40.681]  Okay.
[01:26:40.881 --> 01:26:45.363]  Also, did you know that Sandra Day O'Connor was on the radio show the other day
[01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:49.671]  And made a statement to Paul Harvey that that's what they're going to do.
[01:26:50.131 --> 01:26:52.452]  Yeah, that was reported on, but they've been told to do this.
[01:26:52.472 --> 01:27:02.157]  They've been already doing it for 20, 30 years, but now they're in USA Today, they're on Meet the Press, they're on Paul Harvey, and I did see your quotes, that we've got to do what the UN says.
[01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:05.239]  We've got to start following what their rulings say.
[01:27:05.259 --> 01:27:06.620]  Okay, let's look at the UN system.
[01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:08.062]  That's what we got away from.
[01:27:08.182 --> 01:27:14.247]  Byzantine, command and control, no juries, can't face your accuser, centralized dictatorship.
[01:27:14.547 --> 01:27:16.189]  We're now going to have to follow that?
[01:27:16.449 --> 01:27:17.790]  This is hot treason!
[01:27:18.130 --> 01:27:24.496]  And seven of those nine members were put in by Republicans, and they're the ones that are involved in it.
[01:27:25.874 --> 01:27:28.015]  Well, Alex, I have a suggestion.
[01:27:28.035 --> 01:27:29.176]  I know what I'm going to do.
[01:27:29.196 --> 01:27:34.959]  I mean, if they're going to not recognize the Constitution and rule on constitutional law...
[01:27:35.951 --> 01:27:40.034]  As far as an American, I do not recognize the federal government.
[01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:41.055]  Well, it's not legitimate.
[01:27:41.075 --> 01:27:42.375]  This is not our federal government.
[01:27:42.415 --> 01:27:47.279]  It's a criminal enterprise with its puppets in place, the national security dictatorship.
[01:27:47.599 --> 01:27:49.140]  They're saying they're getting rid of the borders.
[01:27:50.321 --> 01:27:52.282]  We keep saying, fix the problem, fix the problem.
[01:27:52.462 --> 01:27:57.085]  They give extra welfare, extra schooling, all these incentives to get the illegals here.
[01:27:57.145 --> 01:27:59.086]  The government is behind it.
[01:27:59.166 --> 01:28:02.809]  They're destroying America and our economy right now.
[01:28:03.737 --> 01:28:07.079]  Well, the way I look at it, if they come... I told an officer this today.
[01:28:07.519 --> 01:28:09.400]  I told him... He's a friend of mine.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:16.644]  I told him, I said, look, if they want to come to my property with a federal warrant, I said, I don't recognize it anymore.
[01:28:16.785 --> 01:28:19.326]  The Supreme Court's not going to recognize the Constitution.
[01:28:19.726 --> 01:28:21.387]  I do not recognize their authority.
[01:28:21.707 --> 01:28:23.368]  They come armed on my property.
[01:28:23.708 --> 01:28:25.289]  I have a right to defend my family and my life.
[01:28:25.309 --> 01:28:26.170]  Yeah, they're criminals.
[01:28:26.190 --> 01:28:29.192]  They're criminals, and I will take their lives if they come on my property.
[01:28:29.212 --> 01:28:29.972]  That's the way I look at it.
[01:28:30.012 --> 01:28:31.453]  Either they rule by the Constitution...
[01:28:32.148 --> 01:28:34.831]  Or, you know, it's a legitimate government or it's an illegal government.
[01:28:34.971 --> 01:28:36.373]  And right now it's an illegal government.
[01:28:36.753 --> 01:28:37.774]  Well, it really is.
[01:28:37.874 --> 01:28:40.297]  So what did your police officer say?
[01:28:40.337 --> 01:28:41.017]  He was in uniform.
[01:28:41.037 --> 01:28:41.738]  He wasn't saying anything.
[01:28:41.758 --> 01:28:42.239]  I know the man.
[01:28:42.259 --> 01:28:42.899]  He agreed with me.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.741]  I know he agreed with me.
[01:28:44.781 --> 01:28:48.305]  Well, 91% believe in the Second Amendment and they're tired of being told to go lie about it.
[01:28:48.845 --> 01:28:50.267]  Major Poll, thanks for the call.
[01:28:51.108 --> 01:28:52.129]  Anything else you want to add, Jim?
[01:28:53.133 --> 01:28:55.094]  No, we all got to hang together.
[01:28:55.274 --> 01:28:56.554]  We all have to hang together.
[01:28:56.594 --> 01:28:57.514]  Well, we'll hang separate.
[01:28:57.534 --> 01:28:59.275]  Thank you, as Patrick Henry, I believe, said.
[01:28:59.635 --> 01:29:04.316]  We'll be back, and we'll talk to Adam, and then I'm going to shift into news and back into calls.
[01:29:04.456 --> 01:29:05.437]  Bunch of news coming up.
[01:29:06.717 --> 01:29:08.898]  But it's tyrannies upon us, folks.
[01:29:12.899 --> 01:29:13.799]  We're on the march.
[01:29:14.299 --> 01:29:15.900]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:19.521]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:28.941]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[01:29:29.341 --> 01:29:33.423]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[01:29:33.924 --> 01:29:41.128]  Only recently has science discovered that maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[01:29:41.668 --> 01:29:58.764]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels, increased libido, which helps prevent impotence, relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort, helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[01:29:59.064 --> 01:30:01.967]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[01:30:02.467 --> 01:30:10.657]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[01:30:11.057 --> 01:30:12.539]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings.
[01:30:12.559 --> 01:30:14.521]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[01:30:22.708 --> 01:30:33.433]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:30:33.593 --> 01:30:41.177]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:30:41.417 --> 01:30:42.778]  The system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:30:57.390 --> 01:31:01.292]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:31:01.332 --> 01:31:03.233]  The water level is always visible.
[01:31:03.393 --> 01:31:09.375]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:31:09.595 --> 01:31:13.537]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:31:13.557 --> 01:31:14.117]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:31:22.694 --> 01:31:24.356]  I really needed to lose weight.
[01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:25.977]  I was tired, lethargic.
[01:31:26.197 --> 01:31:31.361]  So far, using the collagenate, I've lost 46 pounds.
[01:31:31.381 --> 01:31:33.663]  46 pounds with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:31:34.064 --> 01:31:35.765]  Bernadine, tell me about those inches.
[01:31:36.105 --> 01:31:39.528]  Inches off my chest, my waist, my hips, my thighs.
[01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:43.311]  I was at about a 20, pushing into a size 22.
[01:31:43.411 --> 01:31:45.313]  I'm down to a size 14.
[01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:47.495]  People have been telling me I look younger.
[01:31:47.955 --> 01:31:51.478]  I've lost 46 pounds with collagenate.
[01:31:51.798 --> 01:31:54.261]  It's just one of the best investments I've ever made.
[01:31:54.481 --> 01:32:00.567]  I am so glad that Bernadine took my advice to lose weight the safe and healthy way with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:32:00.808 --> 01:32:04.432]  That was Bernadine's personal experience, and it can be yours next.
[01:32:04.492 --> 01:32:05.353]  What are you waiting for?
[01:32:05.673 --> 01:32:07.074]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:32:07.114 --> 01:32:07.455]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.082]  And get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.
[01:32:16.262 --> 01:32:19.104]  Call now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:32:19.424 --> 01:32:20.265]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:29.431]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:29.931 --> 01:32:32.713]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:32.733 --> 01:32:39.117]  A lot of great callers on this fourth day of November 2003.
[01:32:42.333 --> 01:32:47.095]  Jim in Indiana sounded like a really good guy, and I talk to a lot of people that have those same sentiments.
[01:32:48.276 --> 01:33:00.362]  I mean, when the Supreme Court says they don't care about the Ten Commandments, when they say that they're bringing down rulings because the UN said so, I remember being on the air eight years ago warning people about that.
[01:33:00.382 --> 01:33:01.203]  They'd roll their eyes.
[01:33:01.243 --> 01:33:03.184]  They don't laugh anymore.
[01:33:03.224 --> 01:33:03.804]  It's not funny.
[01:33:05.044 --> 01:33:11.808]  When they say they're going to follow the UN and other courts' orders and precedents, when they say that the police have no
[01:33:12.917 --> 01:33:14.638]  We're good to go.
[01:33:43.263 --> 01:33:48.287]  When they give our troops these deadly vaccines, when they do all the things they've done, this is not our government.
[01:33:49.308 --> 01:33:50.289]  And here's an analogy.
[01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:51.810]  You can't get your mind around this.
[01:33:51.850 --> 01:33:53.952]  We'll go to Adam in New Mexico and then into some news.
[01:33:54.832 --> 01:33:55.873]  I appreciate Adam holding.
[01:33:58.155 --> 01:34:00.477]  Okay, I don't talk about space aliens and stuff like that.
[01:34:00.537 --> 01:34:01.257]  It's an analogy.
[01:34:01.538 --> 01:34:10.525]  Imagine if, like a Simpsons episode, a big alien spacecraft landed in D.C., took over the Capitol, they walked over to the TV cameras...
[01:34:11.434 --> 01:34:11.514]  Okay.
[01:34:11.534 --> 01:34:11.614]  Okay.
[01:34:37.623 --> 01:34:39.164]  So there's the analogy.
[01:34:39.204 --> 01:34:41.365]  Let's use a more reality-based analogy.
[01:34:41.685 --> 01:34:46.928]  Let's say Hitler would have gotten the nuclear bomb first.
[01:34:49.049 --> 01:34:52.331]  Or to be accurate, the atomic bomb first.
[01:34:53.639 --> 01:34:56.782]  And they sent in British Special Forces, American Special Forces.
[01:34:57.142 --> 01:34:58.483]  You talk about daring raids.
[01:34:58.583 --> 01:35:01.185]  I mean, Special Forces doesn't pull stuff like this off today.
[01:35:01.205 --> 01:35:03.947]  I don't know why they were just incredible individuals.
[01:35:04.608 --> 01:35:08.331]  The British, what became the SAS and what became the Special Services in this country.
[01:35:09.251 --> 01:35:14.816]  These guys snuck in to underground German bases in mountains, blew them up.
[01:35:15.336 --> 01:35:17.157]  Snuck into factories, blew them up.
[01:35:17.598 --> 01:35:20.300]  Then they find out that a big tanker of heavy water...
[01:35:21.463 --> 01:35:25.425]  The German system of making atomic weapons had been already shipped out and put on a barge.
[01:35:26.245 --> 01:35:33.388]  They'd swim out, meet the barge, plant a bomb on it, blow up, sink the heavy water down to the bottom of that water.
[01:35:34.788 --> 01:35:37.809]  Heavy water is a compound they use to make nuclear weapons in that primitive fashion.
[01:35:38.110 --> 01:35:40.931]  The point is, Hitler would have gotten that stuff.
[01:35:41.671 --> 01:35:47.253]  What if Hitler would have started sending A-bombs over to London on those V-6s and V-1s?
[01:35:50.054 --> 01:35:52.236]  Flying bombs, guided missiles.
[01:35:53.257 --> 01:35:53.997]  What would have happened?
[01:35:54.017 --> 01:35:56.159]  Well, let's say there had been a capitulation, an armistice.
[01:35:56.739 --> 01:36:02.724]  And just like Iraq had an armistice, or just like Germany had one in World War I, you've got to accept troops in America.
[01:36:04.025 --> 01:36:09.569]  What if they sent German troops over here to boss you around and tell you what to do and to make you work in their factories?
[01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:11.771]  You'd have a right to resist them.
[01:36:12.231 --> 01:36:13.392]  They would be illegitimate.
[01:36:16.459 --> 01:36:17.540]  It's the same thing today, folks.
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:23.304]  We have foreign banks that took over in 1913, the printing of the money, bought up the planet.
[01:36:24.305 --> 01:36:34.393]  In 1947, the government went secret, built all their bunkers, created their shadow government, took over education, started all the dumbing down process, are setting up the police state, gearing up for the next level of control.
[01:36:34.794 --> 01:36:35.975]  It's not your government!
[01:36:37.976 --> 01:36:43.301]  It's as legitimate as if space aliens landed and took over and raised their flag over the Capitol.
[01:36:43.621 --> 01:36:44.982]  It's as legitimate as if the
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:50.721]  As if the Deutschland-Uber-Rallis was our new national anthem.
[01:36:50.881 --> 01:36:52.562]  It's illegitimate!
[01:36:54.162 --> 01:36:54.822]  Totally!
[01:36:56.063 --> 01:36:58.383]  And it's run by sociopathic psychotics.
[01:36:59.104 --> 01:37:00.744]  Let's talk to Adam in New Mexico.
[01:37:00.764 --> 01:37:02.324]  He listens to us on 1310.
[01:37:03.025 --> 01:37:04.105]  Welcome, sir, to the airwaves.
[01:37:04.125 --> 01:37:04.425]  Go ahead.
[01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:07.010]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:10.072]  What a pleasure it is to talk with you.
[01:37:10.092 --> 01:37:11.553]  Good to talk to you, my friend.
[01:37:12.574 --> 01:37:13.794]  Well, you know what?
[01:37:14.875 --> 01:37:17.237]  I'm a first-time caller and a first-time listener.
[01:37:18.718 --> 01:37:23.241]  Formally, I was born in California.
[01:37:23.621 --> 01:37:24.582]  You've got to forgive me.
[01:37:24.722 --> 01:37:25.522]  I'm a little nervous.
[01:37:25.562 --> 01:37:26.543]  Hey, that's okay, my friend.
[01:37:26.563 --> 01:37:26.923]  Welcome.
[01:37:27.804 --> 01:37:30.645]  Okay, but anyway, you know what?
[01:37:30.686 --> 01:37:31.986]  I'm just going to tell you a short story.
[01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:38.090]  My birthday, Alex, falls on April Fool's Day.
[01:37:39.191 --> 01:37:45.614]  And my girlfriend, she attends, what is it, Rio Hondo College in Whittier.
[01:37:45.954 --> 01:37:49.275]  And an instructor gave her your tape.
[01:37:50.516 --> 01:37:51.316]  What is it?
[01:37:51.416 --> 01:37:54.137]  The 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:37:54.978 --> 01:37:56.739]  And I got that as a gag gift from her.
[01:37:58.179 --> 01:37:59.940]  And, you know, we were just...
[01:38:00.487 --> 01:38:01.688]  Well, they're trash of the earth.
[01:38:29.656 --> 01:38:30.036]  Excuse me?
[01:38:30.437 --> 01:38:32.038]  They're trash of the earth.
[01:38:32.138 --> 01:38:32.899]  Oh, definitely.
[01:38:32.999 --> 01:38:33.879]  Definitely right.
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:39.784]  And, you know, I moved over here to Corrales.
[01:38:40.845 --> 01:38:46.550]  And, you know, I got pulled over for a cracked windshield.
[01:38:47.170 --> 01:38:51.654]  And the cop that pulled me over, you know, we started talking about you.
[01:38:51.674 --> 01:38:53.736]  You know, I didn't know who you were or anything like that.
[01:38:53.776 --> 01:38:56.498]  You know, he saw the jacket on the seat there and
[01:38:57.519 --> 01:38:58.260]  He said, well, you know what?
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.081]  I have a tape.
[01:39:00.121 --> 01:39:01.101]  What is it?
[01:39:02.502 --> 01:39:03.803]  Bohemian Grove, I think.
[01:39:03.823 --> 01:39:05.824]  I saw that.
[01:39:06.685 --> 01:39:08.486]  Made 54 copies of that.
[01:39:09.626 --> 01:39:12.748]  We ordered the police tape.
[01:39:14.829 --> 01:39:15.790]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:19.052]  What exactly did the police officer say to you about knowing who I was?
[01:39:20.272 --> 01:39:20.913]  Well, you know what?
[01:39:20.933 --> 01:39:22.954]  He told me, well, you know, Joe, you know...
[01:39:27.708 --> 01:39:29.229]  You know about that tape, right?
[01:39:29.249 --> 01:39:30.730]  I said, you know what I got?
[01:39:31.451 --> 01:39:32.772]  I told him the whole story.
[01:39:33.092 --> 01:39:33.512]  He laughed.
[01:39:33.532 --> 01:39:36.635]  He said, hey, you know what?
[01:39:36.655 --> 01:39:49.305]  Somebody at the police department over here, he's a state cop, and somebody left a copy of that Bohemian Grove, he told me, in his locker, and that turned him around.
[01:39:50.663 --> 01:40:06.273]  So, you know, he told me, he said, you know what, you know, that guy has a large following over here in the state of New Mexico because, you know, everybody's so liberal down here, Alex, and, you know, they, you know, just like some of your callers were saying, you know, there's
[01:40:06.838 --> 01:40:07.779]  And think about that.
[01:40:07.859 --> 01:40:18.307]  We have liberals hearing about why guns are good, hearing why the Constitution's good, and because we'll expose Bush and won't be hypocrites, they will then wake up to Bill Clinton and Hillary.
[01:40:18.527 --> 01:40:22.530]  By not being a hypocrite, we go across the spectrum.
[01:40:23.051 --> 01:40:24.032]  Amen to that, yes.
[01:40:25.493 --> 01:40:25.993]  And you know what?
[01:40:26.013 --> 01:40:27.314]  I've got to tell you something.
[01:40:27.354 --> 01:40:32.979]  The congressmen from Denver, Colorado, they listened to you over there on 1360, Tancredo,
[01:40:36.724 --> 01:40:39.445]  Well, the point is, I'm not even against the people that are coming here.
[01:40:39.465 --> 01:40:41.106]  They're being used.
[01:40:41.126 --> 01:40:42.407]  They're coming from tyranny down south.
[01:40:42.427 --> 01:40:47.509]  And the globalists have helped keep that tyranny in power, helped keep those people in bondage.
[01:40:47.529 --> 01:40:47.909]  The point is...
[01:41:03.297 --> 01:41:08.201]  There's 200-plus million people, 20 million births a year, all coming this way.
[01:41:08.621 --> 01:41:10.062]  We can't sustain it.
[01:41:10.643 --> 01:41:11.903]  I've been to Latin America.
[01:41:12.124 --> 01:41:14.085]  I don't want our standard of living to be like that.
[01:41:14.285 --> 01:41:16.327]  I want to raise their standard of living.
[01:41:16.547 --> 01:41:21.170]  But the globalists have said they want to lower all our standards of living so they can get control of us.
[01:41:21.190 --> 01:41:25.874]  The question is, how do we stop it when the Republicans and the Democrats are selling us down the river?
[01:41:26.635 --> 01:41:27.235]  That's true.
[01:41:27.395 --> 01:41:28.856]  All you've got to do is just look at...
[01:41:30.305 --> 01:41:33.367]  You know, look at the state of California.
[01:41:33.767 --> 01:41:36.990]  I don't know anybody there that's native-born anymore.
[01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:39.011]  You see different people every day.
[01:41:39.351 --> 01:41:40.372]  It's a tower of Babel.
[01:41:40.432 --> 01:41:41.993]  Nobody can communicate with each other.
[01:41:42.654 --> 01:41:43.254]  Amen to that.
[01:41:43.574 --> 01:41:46.116]  No one is assimilating each other's cultures.
[01:41:46.176 --> 01:41:52.400]  It's just turning into a giant mess, and it's only going to get worse until we all come together.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:53.641]  But that is so exciting.
[01:41:54.222 --> 01:41:57.664]  Now, are you saying you made copies of Bohemian Grove, or are you saying the police officer did?
[01:41:58.587 --> 01:42:05.553]  He got, somebody left a copy of that in his locker.
[01:42:07.034 --> 01:42:14.780]  And, you know, to this day, he told me, well, you know what, I don't know whose tape it was or whatever, but I just made, you know, I saw it.
[01:42:15.761 --> 01:42:20.224]  I didn't know who Mr. Jones was.
[01:42:21.365 --> 01:42:25.949]  And, you know, it just, you know, that started from there.
[01:42:27.348 --> 01:42:29.030]  Well, praise God for that.
[01:42:29.070 --> 01:42:30.211]  What an amazing story.
[01:42:30.231 --> 01:42:32.212]  Anything else you'd like to add, my friend?
[01:42:32.673 --> 01:42:38.358]  Well, you know what, I'd just like to tell you, Alex, you know, God bless you and, you know, for all the work that you're doing.
[01:42:38.398 --> 01:42:44.923]  And, you know, all those people that are, you know, that are like me, you know, I'm a, you know, born Republican.
[01:42:45.003 --> 01:42:52.730]  And, you know, like I said, you know, I used to, you know, you know, follow the, you know, the Limbaugh's and all these,
[01:42:53.912 --> 01:42:55.853]  And, you know, I was lied to.
[01:42:55.873 --> 01:42:58.093]  I was lied to, you know, for all those years.
[01:42:58.213 --> 01:43:01.254]  And, you know, it just took a few minutes for me to watch that tape.
[01:43:02.515 --> 01:43:11.057]  And, you know, I encourage anybody and everyone that's, you know, that's listening to this station right now, pick up these tapes.
[01:43:11.797 --> 01:43:19.900]  You know, the facts are there, you know, and, you know, you present the facts, you know, and
[01:43:20.732 --> 01:43:22.954]  And, you know, they're well done, Alex.
[01:43:23.174 --> 01:43:23.714]  They're well done.
[01:43:23.734 --> 01:43:24.055]  Thank you.
[01:43:24.255 --> 01:43:24.635]  Thank you.
[01:43:24.655 --> 01:43:26.796]  And call me back sometime, Adam.
[01:43:26.837 --> 01:43:27.597]  I appreciate the call.
[01:43:28.978 --> 01:43:29.298]  Wow.
[01:43:29.398 --> 01:43:33.001]  And I get those type of letters and e-mails and faxes all the time.
[01:43:34.282 --> 01:43:37.824]  And we're having such a massive effect because of people like Adam.
[01:43:38.825 --> 01:43:40.366]  I mean, I'm just one of the seeds.
[01:43:40.646 --> 01:43:45.050]  And when people like Adam take action, it waters it.
[01:43:45.550 --> 01:43:46.791]  It gives it sunshine.
[01:43:47.842 --> 01:43:52.563]  And imagine that state police officer, another state police officer, obviously stuck it in his locker.
[01:43:53.963 --> 01:43:56.664]  Talkers Magazine, a couple years ago, I saw the statistics.
[01:43:56.744 --> 01:43:59.905]  Over half the people considered themselves, quote, conservatives.
[01:44:00.745 --> 01:44:02.545]  That is the fake Limbaugh type.
[01:44:03.225 --> 01:44:04.546]  And now Talkers just came out.
[01:44:04.566 --> 01:44:06.046]  I heard Dave on Clive's reading the statistics.
[01:44:06.566 --> 01:44:14.308]  Fifty-plus percent consider them independents, not Republican or Democrat, and now only 21% consider themselves a Republican.
[01:44:15.157 --> 01:44:17.418]  People say, well, then that means the Democrats are going to win.
[01:44:17.538 --> 01:44:19.379]  No, of course they're not Democrats.
[01:44:19.839 --> 01:44:20.599]  They know now.
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:24.381]  Because the Republican Party is for all the same things the Democrats are.
[01:44:24.421 --> 01:44:26.402]  They're just able to get it through because you go to sleep.
[01:44:26.722 --> 01:44:27.842]  Look at Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:44:27.982 --> 01:44:33.685]  Open borders, gun control, abortion, giving ID cards to illegals.
[01:44:34.705 --> 01:44:35.566]  All of that stuff.
[01:44:35.946 --> 01:44:36.746]  And a lot more.
[01:44:38.367 --> 01:44:41.288]  And a lot of people woke up when Limbaugh and Hannity endorsed him.
[01:44:42.975 --> 01:44:45.076]  And look, I think Rush Limbaugh should be arrested.
[01:44:45.096 --> 01:44:45.896]  He should go to jail.
[01:44:48.237 --> 01:44:50.919]  Because that guy, I heard him a hundred times.
[01:44:50.979 --> 01:44:53.300]  I listened to Limbaugh since I was in high school, folks.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:57.201]  I remember that guy a hundred times.
[01:44:58.402 --> 01:45:00.423]  Say, anybody caught with drugs should go to jail.
[01:45:00.483 --> 01:45:01.563]  Throw these kids in jail.
[01:45:01.883 --> 01:45:02.604]  Throw them in jail.
[01:45:02.944 --> 01:45:04.265]  Got marijuana, put them in jail.
[01:45:04.325 --> 01:45:07.986]  And this guy is taking a hundred Oxycontins a day sometimes.
[01:45:08.026 --> 01:45:10.407]  That's hillbilly heroin, folks, a narcotic.
[01:45:10.967 --> 01:45:12.028]  Schedule three drugs.
[01:45:13.323 --> 01:45:13.643]  Okay?
[01:45:14.483 --> 01:45:17.865]  Now, if you get busted with it, and you haven't been a hypocrite, I don't think you should go to jail.
[01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:20.646]  But don't sit... And he probably does have a problem.
[01:45:20.666 --> 01:45:22.046]  He did get addicted with back pain.
[01:45:22.266 --> 01:45:22.987]  A lot of people do.
[01:45:23.067 --> 01:45:23.987]  I feel sorry for him.
[01:45:24.167 --> 01:45:33.071]  But no, he could sit there in a mind-drug stupor and then talk to 20 million people and say, put him in jail or they're caught with it.
[01:45:33.391 --> 01:45:34.551]  Put him in jail!
[01:45:34.771 --> 01:45:36.452]  Put him in jail right now!
[01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:41.631]  You know, Limbaugh says, don't worry about the UN taking over.
[01:45:41.731 --> 01:45:44.292]  Oh, those that say it is, oh, they're just lying.
[01:45:44.352 --> 01:45:47.433]  He knew all along, and now it is taking over our courts and everything else.
[01:45:47.954 --> 01:45:50.115]  If he'd have told the truth, this country wouldn't be in this position.
[01:45:50.415 --> 01:45:51.595]  Sean Hannity's even worse.
[01:45:51.655 --> 01:45:53.096]  Limbaugh's good compared to Hannity.
[01:45:53.436 --> 01:45:55.077]  Hannity is a disgusting creature.
[01:45:56.997 --> 01:45:58.478]  Every child needs a microchip.
[01:45:58.658 --> 01:45:59.559]  I love Arnold.
[01:46:00.659 --> 01:46:02.180]  We need to arrest all the militia.
[01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:03.660]  I've heard it all out of his mouth.
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:05.061]  O'Reilly's even worse.
[01:46:07.819 --> 01:46:08.960]  Ban SUVs.
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:10.041]  Tax SUVs.
[01:46:10.401 --> 01:46:11.282]  I'm sick of it.
[01:46:11.302 --> 01:46:16.205]  All right, I'm going to go through a news blitz here of some really important stuff.
[01:46:16.225 --> 01:46:18.126]  Before I do that, you heard Adam.
[01:46:20.208 --> 01:46:23.931]  I forgot to ask him, was the professor doing it as a gag gift?
[01:46:24.391 --> 01:46:24.851]  I doubt it.
[01:46:25.492 --> 01:46:31.336]  I got a couple emails yesterday from professors who say they're having a 99% wake-up rate.
[01:46:31.356 --> 01:46:35.659]  I think one email said out of four classes, one person disagreed after watching Road to Tyranny.
[01:46:36.678 --> 01:46:37.979]  Professors, you're unbelievable.
[01:46:38.179 --> 01:46:40.821]  You're just absolutely amazing what you're doing.
[01:46:41.902 --> 01:46:46.886]  See, we're cutting through that left-right trash back to freedom, back to standing up against bondage.
[01:46:46.946 --> 01:46:48.367]  It's real, simple.
[01:46:48.427 --> 01:46:53.671]  People know it in their bones, know it in their guts that we're slaves, and we don't want to be slaves anymore!
[01:46:56.833 --> 01:47:00.136]  And the Republican-Democrat pony show isn't working anymore.
[01:47:01.197 --> 01:47:02.738]  So, join people...
[01:47:03.630 --> 01:47:14.519]  Like Adam, in the second American revolution or restoration of our republic, for everyone, whether you're German or Jewish or black or white or Hispanic or Asian, if you love freedom, I'm your brother.
[01:47:14.739 --> 01:47:15.439]  I'm your friend.
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:17.301]  We can only win this thing together.
[01:47:17.321 --> 01:47:18.642]  We're in deep trouble, folks.
[01:47:18.682 --> 01:47:21.264]  The globalists have got really sick plans for us.
[01:47:22.965 --> 01:47:23.586]  Admittedly.
[01:47:25.007 --> 01:47:26.068]  Get Matrix of Evil.
[01:47:26.128 --> 01:47:27.208]  Get Police State 3.
[01:47:27.289 --> 01:47:28.930]  Get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:30.231]  Get 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[01:47:30.591 --> 01:47:31.572]  Get Masters of Terror.
[01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:33.671]  Get Police State 2000.
[01:47:33.731 --> 01:47:35.032]  Get America Destroyed by Design.
[01:47:35.072 --> 01:47:36.634]  Get the new book Order Out of Chaos.
[01:47:37.674 --> 01:47:39.096]  Get a second copy to give us a gift.
[01:47:39.116 --> 01:47:40.096]  Get a big discount when you do.
[01:47:40.617 --> 01:47:41.337]  Support us.
[01:47:41.438 --> 01:47:42.198]  We'll support you.
[01:47:42.338 --> 01:47:43.059]  Make copies.
[01:47:43.459 --> 01:47:44.700]  Put them on AXS Television.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:49.184]  Give them to opinion makers, professors, talk show hosts, sheriffs, county commissioners.
[01:47:50.225 --> 01:47:51.546]  And never stop.
[01:47:51.826 --> 01:48:00.113]  Because when I started this stuff ten years ago on cable access, the radio eight years ago, I don't know, the radio in 1995, however long that's been,
[01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:02.229]  Coming up on eight years.
[01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:06.774]  When I started this, I'd load the phone lines with people calling me a kook.
[01:48:07.054 --> 01:48:07.574]  But you know what?
[01:48:07.614 --> 01:48:12.359]  They heard me eight years ago, and now they see it on the news, and they remember that's our power.
[01:48:12.519 --> 01:48:13.641]  Because we're telling the truth.
[01:48:13.981 --> 01:48:15.723]  And the government's a bunch of liars.
[01:48:18.185 --> 01:48:21.108]  They're getting caught in more and more lies and more and more crimes.
[01:48:21.509 --> 01:48:22.790]  So get the videos.
[01:48:23.467 --> 01:48:24.247]  Give them as gifts.
[01:48:24.267 --> 01:48:24.347]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:48:24.467 --> 01:48:25.168]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:48:25.188 --> 01:48:30.690]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, or 1-888-253-3139, or prisonplanet.com.
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:49:00.041]  Or InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net to order the videos via our secure online shopping carts.
[01:49:01.942 --> 01:49:03.022]  Don't wait, folks.
[01:49:03.802 --> 01:49:07.183]  Secondarily, it's vital to the future of this broadcast what we do.
[01:49:07.803 --> 01:49:09.183]  We get more orders, we can expand.
[01:49:09.243 --> 01:49:10.744]  We don't get orders, we contract.
[01:49:11.824 --> 01:49:15.845]  With the staff and what I'm doing, and I'm the guy that carries the garbage out around here.
[01:49:15.905 --> 01:49:17.445]  I'd rather have people that did that.
[01:49:17.485 --> 01:49:21.566]  But, you know, because I could do more radio interviews, fight the globalists more, do a better job on films.
[01:49:23.012 --> 01:49:23.612]  So don't wait.
[01:49:23.692 --> 01:49:24.573]  Do like Adam did.
[01:49:26.053 --> 01:49:26.713]  Take action.
[01:49:26.833 --> 01:49:27.734]  Do it now, folks.
[01:49:27.814 --> 01:49:28.714]  It's so important.
[01:49:28.854 --> 01:49:34.276]  Listen, when I tell you 90% of those that see Road to Tyranny are waking up, that's the numbers.
[01:49:35.436 --> 01:49:38.577]  I've done 1,200-plus interviews the last 26 months.
[01:49:39.518 --> 01:49:41.018]  One caller out of 30 disagrees.
[01:49:41.198 --> 01:49:46.640]  And they're screaming, they're yelling, they're saying, I want to kill you, I want to put you in prison, you need to go to these camps.
[01:49:47.955 --> 01:49:50.716]  And everybody else is coherent, focused, have real points to make.
[01:49:51.036 --> 01:49:52.417]  We got the thinkers, folks.
[01:49:52.857 --> 01:49:54.337]  We got the people that are involved.
[01:49:54.598 --> 01:49:55.818]  We're winning the fight.
[01:49:57.158 --> 01:49:58.479]  The Pentagon's waking up.
[01:49:58.899 --> 01:50:00.340]  The state police are waking up.
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:02.761]  People inside the FBI are scared.
[01:50:02.801 --> 01:50:03.661]  They want to join us.
[01:50:03.761 --> 01:50:04.681]  Give them an open hand.
[01:50:05.722 --> 01:50:12.144]  Join us in honor and duty and family under the type of republic that God wants us to have.
[01:50:12.864 --> 01:50:14.345]  You know in your guts
[01:50:14.998 --> 01:50:18.021]  You know in your soul it's the right thing to do.
[01:50:18.761 --> 01:50:20.003]  Join us.
[01:50:22.908 --> 01:50:26.791]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:27.031 --> 01:50:32.475]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:50:32.755 --> 01:50:43.122]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:50:43.282 --> 01:50:47.605]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:50:47.805 --> 01:50:56.171]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:50:56.431 --> 01:51:02.795]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:02.915 --> 01:51:07.398]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:07.619 --> 01:51:11.841]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:51:12.202 --> 01:51:16.485]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:51:17.365 --> 01:51:18.405]  803-4438.
[01:51:18.465 --> 01:51:21.286]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:21.406 --> 01:51:30.649]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:51:30.909 --> 01:51:35.650]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:41.512]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:51:41.752 --> 01:51:46.295]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:51:46.495 --> 01:51:53.660]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:58.223]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:51:58.383 --> 01:52:00.925]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:52:01.125 --> 01:52:07.830]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:13.313]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:52:13.333 --> 01:52:13.753]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:52:21.994 --> 01:52:22.814]  Oh my God!
[01:52:23.094 --> 01:52:27.796]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:52:28.096 --> 01:52:28.756]  Yes, it's true.
[01:52:28.856 --> 01:52:31.537]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:52:31.677 --> 01:52:35.699]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:52:35.819 --> 01:52:36.359]  You heard it right.
[01:52:36.539 --> 01:52:41.561]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:52:41.701 --> 01:52:42.502]  You may miss out forever.
[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:04.403]  To participate in this limited time offer and have your drugs prescribed over the phone for free, you need to call 1-800-615-7094 now.
[01:53:04.443 --> 01:53:08.006]  That's 1-800-615-7094 for drugs like Phentermine, Ambient, Fioriset, Sama, Ultram, Viagra, and many more.
[01:53:08.026 --> 01:53:09.627]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[01:53:09.647 --> 01:53:10.328]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[01:53:10.368 --> 01:53:14.091]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:29.415 --> 01:53:31.736]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:33.136 --> 01:53:39.439]  You know, some of you may think I'm harsh, really disliking these neocon talk show hosts.
[01:53:39.859 --> 01:53:41.880]  Look, I wouldn't dislike the Redcoats.
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:44.721]  They'd just be the enemy if I was a continental soldier.
[01:53:45.121 --> 01:53:50.583]  I would really hate Benedict Arnold or other insundry traitors.
[01:53:51.523 --> 01:53:56.805]  I mean, Judas Iscariot doesn't hold a very good place in the Bible for betraying Christ.
[01:53:57.719 --> 01:53:59.380]  It's the traitor, folks.
[01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:03.281]  It's the person acting like they've got your best interest, acting like they're a conservative.
[01:54:03.661 --> 01:54:04.602]  That's our major enemy.
[01:54:04.642 --> 01:54:07.403]  And Ron Paul did a big speech about that called Neocond.
[01:54:09.383 --> 01:54:10.664]  The real threat, folks.
[01:54:10.684 --> 01:54:14.725]  We're going to come back in the next segment and go to Kevin, Jason, and others.
[01:54:14.765 --> 01:54:24.069]  Then we've got Al Schneberger, one of the top folks at the Paragon Foundation, former head of the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association, about ways to defeat the land grabbers.
[01:54:26.028 --> 01:54:27.709]  And so this is really important stuff.
[01:54:27.749 --> 01:54:30.031]  Even if you don't own private property, you're going to want to stay tuned for that.
[01:54:30.051 --> 01:54:31.952]  It'll be on in about 30 minutes, and I'll get back to you in another news.
[01:54:32.412 --> 01:54:38.757]  But right now, FDA support for animal cloning warns people are not guinea pigs.
[01:54:39.597 --> 01:54:40.818]  The FDA is being warned that.
[01:54:41.258 --> 01:54:49.244]  Today's statement of support for animal cloning by the FDA was swiftly condemned by Organic Valley, one of the nation's foremost organic brands, and the only one of 100% farmer-owned.
[01:54:52.415 --> 01:54:53.897]  Only one to be 100% farmer-owned.
[01:54:53.997 --> 01:55:02.106]  By allowing foods and cloned animals into the food system without proof of their long-term effects on humans' animal environmental health, the FDA is not protecting the consumer.
[01:55:02.386 --> 01:55:12.698]  The FDA is furthering their support for the abhorrent attempt of corporate interests to control the genes of our citizenry, warned George Simon, CEO of Organic Valley.
[01:55:13.655 --> 01:55:16.660]  American families should not be guinea pigs for corporate greed.
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:27.477]  Contrary to what the FDA says, there is no level of acceptable risk when it comes to putting unproven science on the table for dinner, said Simon in reference to the FDA's pro-cloning rationale.
[01:55:28.018 --> 01:55:28.739]  There's another one.
[01:55:30.925 --> 01:55:41.374]  Cattle are quietly being cloned and sold for high prices as the livestock industry anticipates government approval for letting their offspring into the food chain, industry officials said.
[01:55:41.395 --> 01:55:53.485]  Industry officials, the Austin-based biotech firm Biogen, said Friday the cow cloned from a prodigious producing animal was auctioned for $170,000 in Missouri.
[01:55:54.486 --> 01:55:56.248]  To some members of the Texas Cattle Circus...
[01:55:57.936 --> 01:56:04.201]  Some members of the Texas Cattle Circles, I'm trying to read quick and I mess up, have reservations about whether cloning is commercially practical.
[01:56:04.241 --> 01:56:09.846]  The cost of a cloned calf currently is estimated at $19,000 and some cloned animals develop health problems.
[01:56:10.446 --> 01:56:16.171]  A lot of these cloned animals have not been a high performance and the animals have been cloned from.
[01:56:16.929 --> 01:56:23.753]  Then it goes on with the genetic engineers saying that cloning is good because it speeds up genetic mutation.
[01:56:24.293 --> 01:56:32.777]  Yeah, where you get some two-ton cow that can't walk, and you just stick a tube in it in some closet and feed it, and then you eat that trash.
[01:56:34.058 --> 01:56:35.639]  It'll destroy land rights.
[01:56:35.699 --> 01:56:38.940]  A lot of people pay for their taxes with this stuff.
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:42.822]  My family out in East Texas couldn't hold on to all our land with the taxes.
[01:56:42.842 --> 01:56:44.083]  It wasn't for cows.
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:47.842]  I don't want to babble through this anymore.
[01:56:47.862 --> 01:56:49.023]  It's just horrible, folks.
[01:56:50.905 --> 01:56:53.588]  They're about to approve everything cloned for your dinner table.
[01:56:54.049 --> 01:56:59.675]  They've already approved irradiated beef and chicken and pork for your children when it's just horrible.
[01:57:01.277 --> 01:57:05.983]  Record sun flares, biggest ever with the most ejections ever seen.
[01:57:06.838 --> 01:57:09.419]  Scientists have never witnessed a string of activity like this.
[01:57:09.459 --> 01:57:10.979]  This is from Space.com.
[01:57:11.379 --> 01:57:13.820]  BBC reports what is happening to the sun.
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:16.861]  They say it's one for the record books.
[01:57:16.921 --> 01:57:19.162]  Powerful solar flares are given an X designation.
[01:57:19.622 --> 01:57:22.143]  There was an X8 and X3 event on Sunday.
[01:57:22.463 --> 01:57:25.324]  On Monday there was an X3 flare followed by smaller ones.
[01:57:25.824 --> 01:57:29.285]  Last week there was an X7 and X10 event that took place back to back.
[01:57:29.949 --> 01:57:36.154]  Flares in the next rating are unusual, and if the gas cloud from them reaches the Earth, they're capable of causing geomagnetic storms.
[01:57:36.414 --> 01:57:40.157]  And now there's Borealis or skylights even in Texas, folks.
[01:57:40.177 --> 01:57:44.381]  You know, the weird northern lights, we got those now down here in Texas.
[01:57:45.281 --> 01:57:46.643]  Seeing them at the equator.
[01:57:48.084 --> 01:57:50.446]  We'll continue to track and follow this for you.
[01:57:51.647 --> 01:57:54.789]  Later in the next hour, I'll get back into all the news I haven't gotten to.
[01:57:54.809 --> 01:57:56.110]  It's very frustrating.
[01:57:56.130 --> 01:57:56.731]  There's a lot of it.
[01:57:56.751 --> 01:57:59.433]  Right now, we'll come back and talk to Kevin and
[01:58:00.988 --> 01:58:03.189]  A couple other people that are patiently holding.
[01:58:03.729 --> 01:58:09.692]  Then we'll get to our guest, talk about the land grabbing and how to stop it with some new developments that are positive.
[01:58:09.712 --> 01:58:10.652]  We'll be back in the third hour.
[01:58:13.113 --> 01:58:16.394]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:58:16.434 --> 01:58:20.596]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:58:20.856 --> 01:58:23.657]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:58:27.599 --> 01:58:30.260]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:38.311 --> 01:58:38.951]  Big Brother.
[01:58:39.612 --> 01:58:40.652]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:41.373 --> 01:58:42.474]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:43.134 --> 01:58:43.954]  You want answers?
[01:58:44.735 --> 01:58:45.595]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:45.615 --> 01:58:49.938]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:50.478 --> 01:58:54.561]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:57.162 --> 01:58:57.823]  We've got a...
[01:58:58.726 --> 01:59:01.947]  A plethora of news we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:59:02.327 --> 01:59:06.068]  More on Iraq, more on legislation, more on the police state, what DARPA's up to.
[01:59:06.508 --> 01:59:09.729]  A world ID card publicly being unfurled.
[01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:12.130]  Your calls, it's all coming up.
[01:59:12.610 --> 01:59:27.615]  We have Al Snayberger, former New Mexico Cattle Growers Association head and a member of the Paragon Foundation to talk about some new pro-property rights developments and legal tactics that have been working with the land grabbers
[01:59:28.434 --> 01:59:30.756]  And we've got some environmental land grabber news as well.
[01:59:30.816 --> 01:59:33.098]  Now they're taking property because of endangered bugs.
[01:59:33.218 --> 01:59:36.681]  But first, let's go to Kevin and Jason quickly.
[01:59:36.741 --> 01:59:38.122]  Kevin in Texas, go ahead.
[01:59:38.602 --> 01:59:39.083]  Hey, Alex.
[01:59:39.323 --> 01:59:43.126]  I've got a little bit of an action alert for some of your viewers in the Texas area.
[01:59:43.246 --> 01:59:47.810]  I've got the itinerary for Fox's visit starting tomorrow and Thursday.
[01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:49.511]  That's Vicente.
[01:59:50.092 --> 01:59:51.233]  Open the border, Fox.
[01:59:51.393 --> 01:59:52.514]  El Presidente.
[01:59:53.554 --> 01:59:54.035]  Wednesday...
[01:59:54.818 --> 01:59:56.760]  He is to arrive at 7 p.m.
[01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:58.642]  at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.
[01:59:58.722 --> 02:00:02.106]  He's scheduled to have a dinner at the governor's mansion at 745.
[02:00:02.726 --> 02:00:09.554]  And what I'd like to do is put a call out there to all the listeners in the area to try to arrive around 6.30 p.m.
[02:00:10.074 --> 02:00:11.376]  at 11th and Lavaca.
[02:00:11.416 --> 02:00:15.360]  That's where you get your tags at the DPS office there.
[02:00:16.098 --> 02:00:19.480]  And let's try to meet at 6.30 and stage a protest outside.
[02:00:19.701 --> 02:00:23.703]  No violence, no anger, just... Where did you say he was going to be again?
[02:00:24.124 --> 02:00:25.525]  Governor's Mansion dinner at 7.45.
[02:00:26.005 --> 02:00:28.587]  Okay, and 7.45 tomorrow.
[02:00:28.927 --> 02:00:33.991]  Yeah, so we're going to try to get out there at 6.30 just in case they try to pull one on us.
[02:00:34.051 --> 02:00:36.372]  Perhaps I should arrive with my bullhorn.
[02:00:36.412 --> 02:00:37.993]  Bullhorn in tow, please.
[02:00:38.354 --> 02:00:40.195]  Okay, I'll go ahead and go down there.
[02:00:40.415 --> 02:00:41.216]  Okay, and...
[02:00:42.443 --> 02:00:47.907]  Thursday, 8 a.m., he's having a breakfast with the Chamber of Commerce officials.
[02:00:47.927 --> 02:00:53.651]  9.05, ribbon-cutting at Mexico's new consulate office at 800 Brazos Street.
[02:00:53.671 --> 02:00:57.173]  9.45, arrival at the Capitol for meetings with Governor Rick Perry and reporters.
[02:00:57.673 --> 02:01:02.216]  Noon, lunch and meeting with invited guests at the Four Seasons Hotel.
[02:01:02.236 --> 02:01:07.060]  3.50 p.m., speech for invited audience at the LBJ Auditorium.
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:08.781]  What's important here is...
[02:01:10.064 --> 02:01:10.524]  Invited.
[02:01:11.045 --> 02:01:27.653]  Is that Fox has said he wants totally open borders to merge with the U.S., and they're teaching a little reconquista doctrine that the Southwest belongs to Mexico, and because Mexico's being used as a pawn by the New York banks to break down our sovereignty.
[02:01:28.013 --> 02:01:30.814]  Did you say people were invited to the LBJ event, or that's private?
[02:01:31.075 --> 02:01:31.615]  Oh, private.
[02:01:31.995 --> 02:01:32.295]  Invited.
[02:01:32.475 --> 02:01:32.775]  Of course.
[02:01:34.606 --> 02:01:39.149]  4.50 p.m., visit the LBJ Museum and Library, 6.30, departure from Austin.
[02:01:39.649 --> 02:01:44.693]  And I want to emphasize, let's be there at 6.30 Wednesday at 11th and Lavaca.
[02:01:45.033 --> 02:01:46.994]  It's on the backside of the Governor's Mansion.
[02:01:47.134 --> 02:01:48.075]  You know it well, Alex.
[02:01:48.835 --> 02:01:50.016]  And we'll go from there.
[02:01:50.056 --> 02:01:55.779]  We may protest at the ribbon-cutting ceremony the next morning or when he gets to the Four Seasons.
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:58.441]  But also, he's given an award on Thursday.
[02:02:00.082 --> 02:02:02.744]  Fox will present Rick Barciaga...
[02:02:03.399 --> 02:02:07.642]  Regional president for Wells Fargo Bank with a Mexican government award of appreciation.
[02:02:07.722 --> 02:02:16.529]  Barquiaga worked with Rudy Landros, an assistant chief of the Austin Police Department, to spearhead the widespread acceptance of the matricula card.
[02:02:16.569 --> 02:02:29.720]  Yeah, so we've got an enemy agent here violating federal law, giving people awards that violate federal law, and the reason it's important to go protest him and to bullhorn is so the media can't just write a news article saying how much we all loved it.
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:30.701]  I'll be there...
[02:02:31.761 --> 02:02:36.903]  6.30 or so, tomorrow, downtown, there at the Governor's Mansion.
[02:02:36.943 --> 02:02:37.943]  Folks, I want to see you out there.
[02:02:37.963 --> 02:02:38.204]  Thanks, Kevin.
[02:02:38.224 --> 02:02:39.044]  Let me say one more thing.
[02:02:39.064 --> 02:02:39.704]  Gotta let you go.
[02:02:39.824 --> 02:02:40.424]  Gotta let you go.
[02:02:40.785 --> 02:02:41.665]  Jason in Texas.
[02:02:41.685 --> 02:02:42.385]  Go ahead, Jason.
[02:02:44.666 --> 02:02:44.926]  Alex.
[02:02:45.186 --> 02:02:45.706]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:02:45.726 --> 02:02:46.287]  How are you?
[02:02:46.687 --> 02:02:46.987]  Fine.
[02:02:47.407 --> 02:02:47.747]  Excellent.
[02:02:47.767 --> 02:02:54.169]  Listen, I wanted to touch base in regards to a recent publication that's coming out of Austin Energy.
[02:02:57.134 --> 02:03:01.196]  And my position on it is kind of varied, and I was going to get your take on it.
[02:03:01.276 --> 02:03:02.056]  Okay, tell us about it.
[02:03:02.076 --> 02:03:14.440]  There's a gentleman by the name of Michael Osborne who is a local writer, and he called Silver in the Mine a long-term comprehensive energy plan for the city of Austin.
[02:03:15.401 --> 02:03:21.623]  And aside from the fact that there's maybe some, I guess, leftist rhetoric in there,
[02:03:22.807 --> 02:03:32.393]  The guy seems to be open and, in fact, excited about the fact that it seems like the market is going to push... Stay there.
[02:03:33.794 --> 02:03:38.157]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:03:38.317 --> 02:03:42.760]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:47.283]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:03:47.323 --> 02:03:48.664]  The New World Order...
[02:03:49.424 --> 02:03:50.425]  Can emerge.
[02:03:50.446 --> 02:03:54.670]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:54.730 --> 02:04:01.658]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:04:01.798 --> 02:04:03.801]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:04:04.181 --> 02:04:14.503]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:04:14.783 --> 02:04:20.124]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:04:20.664 --> 02:04:23.285]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:04:23.405 --> 02:04:24.585]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:04:24.605 --> 02:04:25.045]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:04:25.065 --> 02:04:26.866]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:04:33.274 --> 02:04:42.136]  You are sick because you allow yourself to remain sick and you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw food.
[02:04:42.316 --> 02:04:43.657]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[02:04:43.837 --> 02:04:47.838]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[02:04:48.018 --> 02:04:53.819]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[02:04:54.295 --> 02:04:57.336]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[02:04:57.356 --> 02:05:02.798]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.
[02:05:19.224 --> 02:05:19.845]  We're good to go.
[02:05:19.865 --> 02:05:20.286]  We're good to go.
[02:05:32.904 --> 02:05:36.385]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:05:36.645 --> 02:05:40.146]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:05:40.226 --> 02:05:44.167]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:05:44.387 --> 02:05:50.568]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:05:50.968 --> 02:05:58.870]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:05:59.290 --> 02:06:04.632]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:06:04.792 --> 02:06:08.553]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:06:08.934 --> 02:06:10.774]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:06:10.854 --> 02:06:13.015]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:06:13.255 --> 02:06:18.197]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:06:18.237 --> 02:06:23.779]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:31.021]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:06:38.324 --> 02:06:38.964]  Big Brother.
[02:06:39.624 --> 02:06:40.664]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:41.385 --> 02:06:42.485]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:43.145 --> 02:06:43.965]  You want answers?
[02:06:44.726 --> 02:06:45.666]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:45.686 --> 02:06:50.027]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:50.468 --> 02:06:54.529]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:57.191 --> 02:07:02.693]  I have Vicente Fox's itinerary, and I've been thinking about going down there, and what Kevin was saying was accurate.
[02:07:03.714 --> 02:07:07.175]  Sometime between 6.30 and 7.30, his lordship will arrive.
[02:07:07.195 --> 02:07:19.881]  He's here to give awards to local officials that have committed crimes of ordering the police to accept fake ID cards and endanger us all and continue to carry out the fraud of businesses hiring illegals.
[02:07:19.921 --> 02:07:21.421]  You've seen all the arrests taking place.
[02:07:21.441 --> 02:07:23.162]  Here they are committing crimes right in front of us.
[02:07:23.462 --> 02:07:25.463]  The officials trying to continue this criminality.
[02:07:26.112 --> 02:07:30.776]  I'll be protesting El Presidente with El Governor tomorrow.
[02:07:31.636 --> 02:07:39.262]  So I hope to see you down at the Governor's Mansion tomorrow night at about 6.30, downtown Austin, Tejas, if Mr. Fox gets his way.
[02:07:40.143 --> 02:07:41.324]  So that's coming up.
[02:07:41.944 --> 02:07:44.546]  I want to let Jason finish up real quick.
[02:07:44.666 --> 02:07:49.470]  I've got Al Schneberger, former New Mexico Cattlemen Association chairman.
[02:07:50.721 --> 02:07:56.966]  That is New Mexico Cattle Growers Association Chairman, and he's been involved with the Paragon Foundation.
[02:07:56.986 --> 02:08:02.470]  They've been having a lot of victories now by making land grabbers pay you best use for that property.
[02:08:03.151 --> 02:08:13.219]  Okay, this is very important, and I heard Mr. Jones, one of their head guys off the Paragon Foundation on Dairy Brownfields, I wanted to get Mr. Schneeberger on the show.
[02:08:14.068 --> 02:08:16.469]  But real quick, Jason, you say Austin Energy.
[02:08:17.069 --> 02:08:28.513]  Austin Energy is about the government getting involved in forcing you to take so-called green energy systems and selling washing machines, selling dryers, getting into the business of private trade.
[02:08:28.873 --> 02:08:29.873]  That's where I have a problem.
[02:08:29.893 --> 02:08:31.594]  What's this particular thing you were mentioning?
[02:08:32.634 --> 02:08:38.896]  Well, basically, the book that was published is written by an employee of Austin Energy.
[02:08:38.956 --> 02:08:41.077]  But he's basically...
[02:08:41.616 --> 02:08:46.658]  I've been an expert on alternative fuel sources and sustainability over the course of the last 15 years.
[02:08:46.818 --> 02:08:52.440]  But see, that key word, sustainability, is financed by the big banks as the pretext to get people's property.
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:54.140]  Yeah, and I understand that.
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:09:01.763]  But the one thing that I don't understand is that if you look at the precepts of the American founding, one of those is self-reliance.
[02:09:02.403 --> 02:09:03.703]  And honestly, if I had about $100,000 tomorrow...
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:12.304]  And, you know, if new technologies were allowed to develop, you know, I could have a self-saving system in my home.
[02:09:12.445 --> 02:09:13.505]  No, no, no.
[02:09:13.766 --> 02:09:20.651]  I think the alternative energy movement's great, and a lot of what you call patriots are the ones that have actually adopted it for self-sufficiency.
[02:09:21.032 --> 02:09:33.302]  The problem is when they say, and I've been at the Smart Growth conferences, when they say sustainability and all this, that's code for taxing you to drive your car, restricting your systems, giving you hybrid systems that really don't work very well.
[02:09:34.710 --> 02:09:38.528]  Okay, well I tell you what, I'm going to send along my review of the book.
[02:09:40.073 --> 02:09:43.956]  And I'd like you to look it over and basically tell me what you think.
[02:09:43.976 --> 02:09:44.876]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:09:44.917 --> 02:09:46.898]  I mean, I really can't comment on this particular book.
[02:09:46.978 --> 02:09:52.302]  I just, Austin Energy and the Austin Air Force and these other groups do a lot of bad things.
[02:09:52.462 --> 02:09:57.286]  I'm sure they've got good people working there, but again, I'm just talking about the general direction it's all going in.
[02:09:57.486 --> 02:10:02.370]  Yeah, and also, I do want to mention that the book is free.
[02:10:02.630 --> 02:10:03.551]  Now, it's not free.
[02:10:03.731 --> 02:10:05.773]  It's been paid for with grant money.
[02:10:06.539 --> 02:10:13.120]  But if you walk into Book People tomorrow and you ask any number of people where you can get a copy, they'll give you a copy.
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:14.720]  Okay, thank you so much.
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:16.221]  And maybe we'll get him on as a guest.
[02:10:16.381 --> 02:10:16.741]  All right.
[02:10:18.541 --> 02:10:28.523]  I got articles here where they're planting salamanders on people's land, planting the links of the bobcat, where they're planting wolves, where they're planting dragonflies.
[02:10:29.783 --> 02:10:31.363]  They're doing this all over the place.
[02:10:32.124 --> 02:10:33.404]  And it's about getting your property.
[02:10:33.424 --> 02:10:34.664]  But more and more, it's just about
[02:10:35.419 --> 02:10:40.501]  And the Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club, and others, being the biggest landowners in the country, financed by big banks.
[02:10:40.561 --> 02:10:43.362]  I've been to the Smart Growth Conference, as I just said, several times.
[02:10:44.162 --> 02:10:51.125]  Coming in and stealing your land, bullying you into their federal courts, where they pay you a pittance what it's worth, but you have a recourse.
[02:10:51.921 --> 02:10:52.361]  We're good to go.
[02:10:52.401 --> 02:10:52.602]  I think?
[02:11:13.935 --> 02:11:22.822]  And he is the former New Mexico Cattle Growers Association head and has worked with the Paragon Foundation, the premier land rights organization in the country.
[02:11:23.383 --> 02:11:24.984]  And, Al, it's good to have you on the show.
[02:11:25.284 --> 02:11:26.445]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:11:27.006 --> 02:11:27.666]  Glad to be here.
[02:11:27.786 --> 02:11:28.187]  You bet.
[02:11:28.247 --> 02:11:37.174]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and about the Paragon Foundation and all the cases you've been involved in and, via trial and error, what you've learned.
[02:11:37.954 --> 02:11:39.956]  Well, I don't know if I can go into all of it.
[02:11:40.036 --> 02:11:41.778]  I can give you a general overview.
[02:11:42.856 --> 02:11:53.960]  First off, I was the executive director of the New Mexico Cattle Growers for six years, and so I'm sure that the president wouldn't want me introduced as the... All these titles get confusing.
[02:11:54.100 --> 02:11:54.500]  All right.
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:54.760]  Yeah.
[02:11:55.461 --> 02:12:07.165]  Well, and then before that, I was associated with the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, and I have a master's degree in range science, which I probably never used, but...
[02:12:08.712 --> 02:12:17.935]  You know, when I got out of school, I wanted to manage land, and it turned out that I had to go out and fight to manage a piece of ground anymore.
[02:12:18.035 --> 02:12:22.037]  Those people that want to be stewards, they've got a real serious problem.
[02:12:22.077 --> 02:12:28.619]  If you just want to take care of a piece of ground and live your life on it in peace, it's getting harder and harder in this country to do that.
[02:12:29.238 --> 02:12:36.705]  Well, that's feudalism, that's serfdom, and they could certainly use somebody like you out in California or New Mexico to stop all these fires.
[02:12:37.165 --> 02:12:44.292]  Statistically, managed property has more wildlife, the animals flock to it.
[02:12:44.332 --> 02:12:44.933]  Why is that?
[02:12:45.583 --> 02:12:50.886]  Well, landowners always take better care of their property than the government.
[02:12:50.906 --> 02:12:54.889]  You know, we have a concept called the tragedy of the commons.
[02:12:54.929 --> 02:12:55.809]  Have you ever heard of that?
[02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:57.870]  Why don't you elaborate on it for the listeners?
[02:12:57.890 --> 02:13:08.457]  Well, the tragedy of the commons goes back to the idea that when they used to set up towns and they'd have a commons in the middle of the town and nobody owned the commons.
[02:13:08.557 --> 02:13:13.460]  And one of the phenomena that took place is when nobody owns something, everybody misuses it.
[02:13:14.344 --> 02:13:21.170]  And that's what's happened on a lot of these federal lands and lands that are owned in common by people.
[02:13:22.111 --> 02:13:23.332]  They don't have a vested interest.
[02:13:23.412 --> 02:13:24.553]  It doesn't really belong to them.
[02:13:24.573 --> 02:13:28.316]  They can't ever claim any title to it, so they don't take good care of it.
[02:13:28.336 --> 02:13:30.178]  Well, that's why communism doesn't work.
[02:13:30.238 --> 02:13:31.679]  This is a basic principle.
[02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:32.900]  Exactly so.
[02:13:33.081 --> 02:13:39.166]  Now, the idea of the tragedy of the commons was an old range science idea that came forward.
[02:13:40.118 --> 02:13:44.001]  Of course, rain science was the original applied ecology.
[02:13:44.281 --> 02:13:52.528]  And it was the rain science people that came forward and gave us all the terms, ecology and ecotone and ecozone and all of that stuff.
[02:13:53.288 --> 02:13:59.253]  And they were the ones that went out in the world and looked how the world really worked and applied science to it.
[02:13:59.433 --> 02:14:04.577]  But now the rain science guys have kind of fallen into...
[02:14:05.413 --> 02:14:08.797]  I saw a presentation by one of these guys on TV here locally.
[02:14:22.694 --> 02:14:24.455]  Of course, it was on this local cable access.
[02:14:24.475 --> 02:14:25.115]  You never see it.
[02:14:25.575 --> 02:14:26.696]  He took hundreds of acres.
[02:14:26.756 --> 02:14:27.796]  It was all dry and dead.
[02:14:27.816 --> 02:14:38.641]  And over ten years, by planting the right grasses, suddenly there were all these springs running, and now he has a small lake and streams all just by the grasses he planted.
[02:14:39.141 --> 02:14:39.401]  Yeah.
[02:14:40.322 --> 02:14:46.964]  Well, you know, we can do, you know, any piece of ground out there is going to produce more with management than without management.
[02:14:46.984 --> 02:14:48.125]  And that's the false statement.
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:58.583]  The premise of environmentalism is that nature has some specific thing that nature's moving to and that we have to step out of the way and let nature go there.
[02:14:58.603 --> 02:14:59.483]  Nature doesn't care.
[02:14:59.843 --> 02:15:01.424]  Nature absolutely does not care.
[02:15:01.464 --> 02:15:05.845]  If there's never another spotted owl born in the world, nature doesn't care.
[02:15:06.906 --> 02:15:09.346]  You've got some kind of spider down there I read this morning.
[02:15:09.366 --> 02:15:13.047]  They were punching a highway through and they found a spider in a cavern.
[02:15:13.107 --> 02:15:14.368]  Now they've got to stop the highway.
[02:15:15.429 --> 02:15:21.620]  Yeah, and cave bugs and dragonflies, and of course it's all scams to get control of a feudalist serve system.
[02:15:22.963 --> 02:15:26.429]  I was listening to Mr. Jones on the Derry Brownfield Show.
[02:15:26.449 --> 02:15:27.391]  He was talking about...
[02:15:28.706 --> 02:15:31.307]  Well, the highest and best use, of course, is what the government likes to do.
[02:15:31.327 --> 02:15:43.189]  And, of course, I've got to tell you right up front, whenever the government moves in next door to you, the government's kind of like, you know, there used to be a story that ranchers used to tell about the big cattle baron and, you know,
[02:15:57.032 --> 02:16:00.534]  And, you know, they said, well, he's trying to buy up all the country.
[02:16:00.574 --> 02:16:01.594]  And he said, no, no.
[02:16:01.634 --> 02:16:03.155]  He said, I'm not trying to buy it all up.
[02:16:03.215 --> 02:16:05.115]  He said, I just want that which joins me.
[02:16:05.936 --> 02:16:07.476]  And that's the way the government is.
[02:16:07.897 --> 02:16:08.897]  They're not trying to get it all.
[02:16:08.917 --> 02:16:11.478]  They just want everything that touches them to become theirs.
[02:16:12.759 --> 02:16:24.383]  But if they move in next to you and they have any kind of a program going to acquire land, it will depress the value of those properties almost immediately.
[02:16:24.423 --> 02:16:25.964]  And that's one of the things that the government...
[02:16:26.599 --> 02:16:27.359]  Yeah, that which joins me.
[02:16:27.379 --> 02:16:28.540]  That's all they want, that which joins me.
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:29.460]  And it doesn't stop.
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:32.701]  But, you know, they'll come in and they might want to take a ranch or a farm and
[02:16:54.794 --> 02:17:01.639]  You know, they want to pay the farmer based on what he gets in production, what he produces in production, and that's what the land is worth.
[02:17:01.719 --> 02:17:03.921]  Well, you know, this guy, he's a good steward.
[02:17:03.941 --> 02:17:04.702]  He likes ranching.
[02:17:04.722 --> 02:17:05.522]  He likes farming.
[02:17:05.562 --> 02:17:06.763]  He does it for the way of life.
[02:17:06.824 --> 02:17:14.430]  He feels like he's making a contribution by being a good steward and passing the land on to his children and giving them at least as good as he got.
[02:17:14.650 --> 02:17:18.233]  And so this has hundreds of years of profitability factored in.
[02:17:18.293 --> 02:17:19.974]  It has the cultural factors.
[02:17:20.054 --> 02:17:21.055]  It has the homestead.
[02:17:21.095 --> 02:17:22.076]  It has all of that.
[02:17:22.136 --> 02:17:23.137]  They've got to pay for that.
[02:17:23.357 --> 02:17:28.058]  They don't pay for culture, and they don't pay for stewardship, and they don't pay for the future.
[02:17:29.019 --> 02:17:37.541]  Now, they're going to acquire the property, and they're going to acquire it under the guise that we're going to acquire this for the future.
[02:17:38.041 --> 02:17:41.122]  So on one hand, they're saying that this is priceless.
[02:17:41.202 --> 02:17:42.083]  We have to have it.
[02:17:42.163 --> 02:17:44.283]  It has to be in the hands of the commons.
[02:17:45.364 --> 02:17:47.944]  All the people have to have this because it's so valuable.
[02:17:48.024 --> 02:17:52.986]  But then on the other hand, they want to take it for the production value of a few cows.
[02:17:53.798 --> 02:18:07.852]  And so what we've been trying to do and been fairly successful at is trying, you know, of course, you want to fight these takings long before you get to the point where you're down to the valuation.
[02:18:07.912 --> 02:18:10.155]  But there are several ways that you do it.
[02:18:10.175 --> 02:18:11.896]  Well, let's go over that, Al.
[02:18:11.916 --> 02:18:13.218]  We've got a quick break here.
[02:18:13.258 --> 02:18:14.339]  Come back and let's go over.
[02:18:15.387 --> 02:18:16.068]  How you do that.
[02:18:16.168 --> 02:18:17.249]  This is very important.
[02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:22.115]  And this goes for if you're trying to take your neighborhood for a shopping mall, folks.
[02:18:22.135 --> 02:18:23.977]  This affects everybody.
[02:18:24.478 --> 02:18:25.419]  So learn something.
[02:18:25.479 --> 02:18:25.999]  Stay with us.
[02:18:26.039 --> 02:18:27.501]  These guys are on the forefront of this.
[02:18:27.521 --> 02:18:29.143]  They know what they're talking about.
[02:18:29.303 --> 02:18:30.124]  Al, stay right there.
[02:18:30.544 --> 02:18:31.225]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:18:31.245 --> 02:18:31.766]  We'll be right back.

[02:19:32.913 --> 02:19:36.174]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:19:36.234 --> 02:19:40.395]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:19:40.675 --> 02:19:43.455]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:19:43.655 --> 02:19:46.056]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:19:46.236 --> 02:19:54.878]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:19:55.078 --> 02:19:56.438]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:19:56.618 --> 02:20:00.859]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path

[02:21:29.790 --> 02:21:32.912]  Oh my God!
[02:21:33.193 --> 02:21:37.917]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.

[02:21:44.220 --> 02:21:46.642]  Tony DelVecchio is coming to this station very soon.
[02:21:46.742 --> 02:21:47.282]  I'm sweet.
[02:21:47.342 --> 02:21:48.723]  I book any day now.
[02:21:49.144 --> 02:21:50.085]  You're going to love his show.
[02:21:51.746 --> 02:21:56.910]  That's all about this with your host, Tony DelVecchio, Saturday evenings from 9 to 10 p.m.
[02:21:56.970 --> 02:22:00.213]  Central Time, right here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:22:01.736 --> 02:22:02.717]  Or call the National Line at 877-996-4327.
[02:22:40.044 --> 02:22:43.067]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[02:22:43.667 --> 02:22:46.269]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:49.652]  I'm the guy who's a boss on this highway.
[02:22:49.932 --> 02:22:52.654]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[02:22:52.995 --> 02:22:55.076]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me.
[02:22:55.116 --> 02:22:56.077]  Welcome back, folks.
[02:22:56.117 --> 02:22:59.240]  Got about 35 minutes left in this broadcast today.
[02:23:00.384 --> 02:23:05.669]  I'm going to have our guest with us about 15 more minutes, then I'm going to shift back into a bunch of news we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:23:05.729 --> 02:23:12.596]  He's Al Snayberger, and he's the former New Mexico Cattle Growers Association Executive Director.
[02:23:13.456 --> 02:23:18.401]  And we're talking about the land grabbers and tactics to counter them.
[02:23:19.422 --> 02:23:25.608]  And if you haven't been harassed by these people yet, believe me, it's coming down the pike, whether you own an acre or a thousand acres.
[02:23:26.573 --> 02:23:27.654]  What are some of their tricks?
[02:23:27.754 --> 02:23:35.501]  How does it usually begin if it's state, federal, or if it's just a local land grab group getting a state or city to pass a law against your land?
[02:23:35.861 --> 02:23:36.742]  How do you counter this?
[02:23:36.902 --> 02:23:37.623]  How do you fight it?
[02:23:37.683 --> 02:23:41.806]  What are some of the tricks in the years of the Paragon Foundation fighting these cases?
[02:23:43.748 --> 02:23:43.928]  Al?
[02:23:46.770 --> 02:23:53.156]  You don't want to wait until they're out there in front of your house making you an offer before you do something about it.
[02:23:53.846 --> 02:23:59.651]  And if ever people should be vigilant, now is the time for them to watch this stuff closely.
[02:23:59.671 --> 02:24:02.973]  A very terrible thing happened four or five years ago.
[02:24:02.993 --> 02:24:08.557]  The Supreme Court expanded the meaning of the term eminent domain.
[02:24:09.538 --> 02:24:22.668]  It was always thought up until that time that government entities could acquire property for highways and dockyards and power lines and things like that.
[02:24:22.728 --> 02:24:27.872]  And most people would agree that there is some legitimate reason for doing those things.
[02:24:28.812 --> 02:24:37.339]  But then the Supreme Court came in and they said that government entities, if they could identify a public good,
[02:24:38.902 --> 02:24:45.646]  To the acquisition, then it could fall under the eminent domain part of the Constitution.
[02:24:45.666 --> 02:24:47.066]  And now we have view sheds.
[02:24:47.086 --> 02:24:54.131]  We're taking all your beach houses, or we're making you tear down your farmhouse because we can see it from the highway and it hurts the view shed.
[02:24:54.451 --> 02:24:55.151]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:56.012 --> 02:25:03.136]  Well, I don't know if you all have talked about the situation where Walmart comes into a town that's,
[02:25:03.866 --> 02:25:04.727]  We're good to go.
[02:25:04.747 --> 02:25:05.368]  We're good to go.
[02:25:25.774 --> 02:25:33.421]  Because the town could identify a benefit for the jobs and the taxes it would bring into the community.
[02:25:33.441 --> 02:25:37.085]  And the sick thing is they won't even pay you fair value because people don't know their rights.
[02:25:37.885 --> 02:25:40.948]  Well, yeah, but you're exactly right.
[02:25:41.188 --> 02:25:50.477]  And I know that's kind of what we're talking about, but once you get to that point where they're at the valuation point,
[02:25:51.509 --> 02:25:52.429]  It's already gone too far.
[02:25:52.469 --> 02:25:53.710]  Okay, how do you stop that?
[02:25:54.090 --> 02:25:55.350]  What do we do to stop this?
[02:25:55.650 --> 02:26:00.812]  You can fight for the highest valuation you can get, and we're using a number of formulas.
[02:26:00.872 --> 02:26:08.974]  Some of them are formulas that were developed by the environmental community to stop dam building and things like that, and they've been fairly effective.
[02:26:10.934 --> 02:26:12.355]  They used to do the economic...
[02:26:13.690 --> 02:26:21.574]  Evaluations on those projects, they would come in and they would say, well, the dam's going to generate this much electricity and this much recreation.
[02:26:21.594 --> 02:26:22.694]  This is why we need to have it.
[02:26:23.395 --> 02:26:36.161]  And environmentalists would come in and say, yeah, but all this natural habitat and all these biological wonders that are down in this canyon and the value to the future generations and all this stuff.
[02:26:36.701 --> 02:26:41.143]  Well, there are formulas where you can plug that stuff in if you know about them.
[02:26:41.793 --> 02:26:45.094]  All right, but you were saying stop it before it comes to that.
[02:26:45.854 --> 02:26:46.435]  What do you do?
[02:26:46.935 --> 02:27:00.379]  Well, the first thing is people need to watch what's going on in their government because, you know, we worry about the economy and we worry about the price of gasoline, but I'm telling you, these governments are out there and they're doing things.
[02:27:01.079 --> 02:27:06.802]  So just like 400 cities have passed laws against the Patriot Act, we need to go in and take over our cities and counties to stop the land grabbing.
[02:27:06.822 --> 02:27:06.922]  Yeah.
[02:27:27.572 --> 02:27:37.483]  Well, if you've ever been involved in the political process, it's a lot easier to stop something before it happens than to get it repealed after it's happened.
[02:27:37.503 --> 02:27:43.330]  And, you know, I tell people all the time, we're going to have to be at least as tough as the people that settled this country.
[02:27:44.631 --> 02:27:46.754]  And they always say, well, yeah, but...
[02:27:47.546 --> 02:27:50.769]  I'd rather fight engines than I would to use a fax machine.
[02:27:51.029 --> 02:27:54.272]  And I always say, well, did you really ever fight any engines?
[02:27:54.392 --> 02:27:59.677]  I mean, it's, you know, being a pioneer is not that easy.
[02:28:00.517 --> 02:28:06.282]  And passing it on to our children is not going to be that easy because we're in serious trouble in this country.
[02:28:07.684 --> 02:28:11.367]  Well, the same thing that happened to the Native Americans is now happening to everybody.
[02:28:12.043 --> 02:28:16.725]  The same type of land grabbing, same type of putting us in these compact cities, modern reservations.
[02:28:17.125 --> 02:28:18.425]  So what comes around goes around.
[02:28:19.345 --> 02:28:21.186]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[02:28:21.206 --> 02:28:22.146]  Al, stay with us.
[02:28:24.167 --> 02:28:25.067]  We're on the march.
[02:28:25.567 --> 02:28:27.168]  The empire's on the run.
[02:28:28.088 --> 02:28:30.789]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:33.994 --> 02:28:36.736]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[02:28:36.976 --> 02:28:43.279]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[02:28:43.579 --> 02:28:49.463]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them but still have them safe and sound?
[02:28:49.923 --> 02:28:53.665]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax-exempt?
[02:28:54.392 --> 02:28:55.933]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[02:28:56.193 --> 02:28:57.053]  Well, there is a way.
[02:28:57.314 --> 02:29:03.397]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[02:29:03.777 --> 02:29:14.042]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[02:29:14.102 --> 02:29:14.903]  Constitution.
[02:29:15.183 --> 02:29:16.824]  You don't have to go offshore to do it either.
[02:29:17.084 --> 02:29:19.365]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[02:29:19.845 --> 02:29:27.550]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the Internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:32.253]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:29:35.219 --> 02:29:39.721]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:29:40.081 --> 02:29:44.162]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:29:44.462 --> 02:29:45.003]  We listened.
[02:29:45.323 --> 02:29:50.305]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:29:50.585 --> 02:29:51.065]  We listened.
[02:29:51.445 --> 02:29:54.486]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:29:54.906 --> 02:29:55.446]  We listened.
[02:29:55.907 --> 02:29:59.468]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:29:59.588 --> 02:30:00.369]  We're good to go.
[02:30:25.930 --> 02:30:26.791]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.

[02:30:33.544 --> 02:30:34.545]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[02:30:34.765 --> 02:30:37.106]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:30:37.206 --> 02:30:37.907]  You heard that right.
[02:30:37.987 --> 02:30:40.469]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:30:40.629 --> 02:30:41.549]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:30:41.810 --> 02:30:43.090]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:30:43.371 --> 02:30:44.892]  Now is the time to fight back.

[02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:50.846]  We're talking to Al Snayberger, former New Mexico Cattle Grower Association Executive Director, member of the Paragon Foundation.
[02:31:50.866 --> 02:31:54.028]  Doing a great job fighting all this tyranny.
[02:31:54.068 --> 02:31:59.493]  Coming up here in about ten minutes after our guest leaves us, we'll go to Lorraine in California and others and get into some more news.
[02:32:01.394 --> 02:32:03.716]  But Al, let's say somebody's got a ranch.
[02:32:04.995 --> 02:32:09.196]  And suddenly they claim there's a golden-cheeked warbler bird that may have been seen on your property.
[02:32:09.216 --> 02:32:11.296]  We just want you to sign an agreement.
[02:32:11.716 --> 02:32:16.077]  We'll even pay you a little money saying that you will check with us before you use your land.
[02:32:16.557 --> 02:32:18.077]  What do those agreements really do?
[02:32:18.157 --> 02:32:19.798]  How should somebody respond to that?
[02:32:20.158 --> 02:32:24.258]  What are some of the other ways that the land grabbers come at you, state, federal, local, private?
[02:32:24.598 --> 02:32:26.199]  Well, don't sign anything like that.
[02:32:26.219 --> 02:32:33.380]  And if you don't believe me, just go ask your realtor because the value of that property will drop precipitously if you sign any of those kind of agreements.
[02:32:34.389 --> 02:32:40.714]  There are some people that say they've done well with them, but our experience has been that it guts the value of that property.
[02:32:41.154 --> 02:32:42.496]  Nobody wants it for the future.
[02:32:43.036 --> 02:32:45.678]  They don't want those kind of covenants laid on the property.
[02:32:46.098 --> 02:32:47.920]  Well, it's got a big, fat lien on it.
[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:48.540]  Sure.
[02:32:48.821 --> 02:32:50.442]  It's got a big, fat lien on it.
[02:32:50.782 --> 02:32:52.063]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:32:52.263 --> 02:32:53.564]  It can never be developed.
[02:32:53.624 --> 02:32:58.408]  And what people are finding is that we're not talking housing developments here.
[02:32:58.428 --> 02:33:01.791]  We're talking about building a new outbuilding, a hay barn or something.
[02:33:02.031 --> 02:33:08.797]  Now, by the way, once the land grabbers have gotten property, though, they'll take the restrictions off and build a shopping mall there.
[02:33:08.817 --> 02:33:09.678]  We've seen a lot of that.
[02:33:09.918 --> 02:33:22.109]  Yeah, it's amazing how the Nature Conservancy can go out on the seashore and buy up a bunch of beach that they say must not be developed, and then the next thing you know, they're putting an appropriate type development out there.
[02:33:22.829 --> 02:33:32.477]  And then the movie stars and all their friends move out there, and it really is an elitism that is unprecedented for this country, but not in the world.
[02:33:32.857 --> 02:33:33.958]  Well, it's freebooting.
[02:33:34.038 --> 02:33:35.859]  It's piracy, Al.
[02:33:36.179 --> 02:33:44.846]  Yeah, as you said, it is a type of feudalism, and they've bankrupted this country on our productivity.
[02:33:46.232 --> 02:33:49.154]  Based on the productivity of the country in the future.
[02:33:49.374 --> 02:33:53.436]  Now you've got these outfits like the Nature Conservancy.
[02:33:53.476 --> 02:33:55.777]  They say, well, we really believe in property rights.
[02:33:56.478 --> 02:34:00.220]  I've always said, yeah, they believe in property rights like a vulture believes in death.
[02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:01.440]  They're all for it.
[02:34:01.460 --> 02:34:02.761]  They just don't want no part of it.
[02:34:04.102 --> 02:34:06.123]  Well, they believe in it once they own the property.
[02:34:06.383 --> 02:34:08.124]  Oh, yeah.
[02:34:08.204 --> 02:34:11.045]  They believe in using every part of the system out there.
[02:34:11.065 --> 02:34:14.507]  But when you get these NGOs, non-governmental organizations...
[02:34:15.211 --> 02:34:18.353]  ...that are aligned with the government, then it's a serious problem.
[02:34:18.613 --> 02:34:20.734]  Now, last year we had Jay-Z and Wally on.
[02:34:21.374 --> 02:34:29.838]  The legislative director of the NRA was getting behind a $47 billion land grab bill, and NRA had nothing to do with that.
[02:34:29.878 --> 02:34:31.239]  He tried to attack Paragon.
[02:34:31.279 --> 02:34:33.500]  Paragon hit back, and that guy got fired.
[02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:36.741]  That shows the power of the grassroots when folks get involved.
[02:34:37.162 --> 02:34:39.243]  How do people get involved with Paragon Foundation?
[02:34:39.583 --> 02:34:42.544]  Well, they can call us at Paragon Foundation at...
[02:34:45.287 --> 02:34:50.049]  505-434-3195, and we'll get them plugged in if they want to help out.
[02:34:50.089 --> 02:34:51.849]  And the website's paragon.org.
[02:34:52.850 --> 02:35:00.833]  Yeah, paragon.org is the email, and then there's also ecologic at freedom.org.
[02:35:00.973 --> 02:35:02.033]  And that's Henry Lamb.
[02:35:02.413 --> 02:35:03.193]  That's Henry Lamb.
[02:35:03.213 --> 02:35:06.475]  He's part of our group.
[02:35:06.675 --> 02:35:10.636]  Now, I heard Bob Jones, your head honcho, correct?
[02:35:12.036 --> 02:35:16.205]  Well, he's the chairman of the board of directors of Paragon.
[02:35:16.245 --> 02:35:16.606]  Yes.
[02:35:16.867 --> 02:35:19.974]  I mean, I heard him on last week and he was saying that
[02:35:21.025 --> 02:35:24.086]  That landowners were having defeat after defeat after defeat.
[02:35:24.106 --> 02:35:27.986]  I only heard part of the conversation, but he said you guys had developed some stuff that was actually working.
[02:35:28.327 --> 02:35:35.148]  What are some of the bright spots, even in these corrupt globalist courts, as Mr. Jones was calling it, at countering these people?
[02:35:35.488 --> 02:35:46.150]  Well, in some of the lawsuits that we've been involved in, one of them, the Wayne Haig lawsuit, and it will go to trial to see how much money Wayne gets from the government.
[02:35:46.170 --> 02:35:49.351]  And, of course, if he wins, that'll be a big win for everybody.
[02:35:49.631 --> 02:35:49.731]  And...
[02:35:52.044 --> 02:35:54.384]  I don't know if you've talked to him or had him on your program before.
[02:35:54.544 --> 02:35:58.466]  Why don't you, in a nutshell, tell about that story, because I am familiar with him, for those that don't know.
[02:35:58.526 --> 02:36:03.908]  And then we've got cases of him coming at gunpoint, stealing people's cows, going to auctions illegally.
[02:36:03.948 --> 02:36:04.888]  I mean, they're out of control.
[02:36:05.128 --> 02:36:05.768]  Oh, yeah.
[02:36:05.788 --> 02:36:11.090]  The law enforcement end of the BLM and the Forest Service, I mean, they're big-time cops now.
[02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:13.631]  They all go to law enforcement school, and they...
[02:36:14.341 --> 02:36:14.501]  Yeah.
[02:36:29.241 --> 02:36:33.464]  There was a case in Nevada last year where they'd stolen the cows off the private property.
[02:36:33.824 --> 02:36:34.804]  They were in trouble.
[02:36:34.844 --> 02:36:39.567]  They didn't have a bill of sale or a warrant or anything to be at the auction selling it.
[02:36:39.848 --> 02:36:48.153]  The owners were on the public street protesting, and there's video of the BLM guy running up with a gun, pointing it at the man with the sign.
[02:36:49.033 --> 02:36:49.233]  Yeah.
[02:36:49.734 --> 02:36:51.435]  Well, it even gets worse than that.
[02:36:51.455 --> 02:36:52.976]  There was a gentleman in California.
[02:36:53.616 --> 02:36:53.696]  U.S.
[02:36:53.716 --> 02:36:55.757]  Fish and Wildlife wanted his property stolen,
[02:36:58.754 --> 02:37:03.097]  They wanted it to add to a wildlife refuge that they were putting together.
[02:37:04.038 --> 02:37:12.684]  And so they happened to tell the DEA that the gentleman was growing marijuana on his place, which was completely unsubstantiated.
[02:37:12.744 --> 02:37:21.010]  They went to his house in the middle of the night, broke the door down, came in with what they call flashbangs, throwing flashbangs in his house.
[02:37:21.030 --> 02:37:25.653]  Of course, he jumps up out of bed and grabs his rifle and goes to defend his home, and they killed him dead.
[02:37:26.333 --> 02:37:33.197]  And then they found the documents where they bragged, this guy's got a lot of land, we're going to get the property, and the cops are going to get part of the money.
[02:37:33.257 --> 02:37:35.238]  This was on California News, mainstream.
[02:37:35.818 --> 02:37:37.279]  Then his wife protested.
[02:37:38.203 --> 02:37:43.207]  He's dead, and they don't chastise or put these guys in jail.
[02:37:44.508 --> 02:37:51.113]  These federal agents, I guess Congress thinks, and really, law enforcement today, we're talking about bureaucrats.
[02:37:51.474 --> 02:37:53.375]  That's what they are, is bureaucrats.
[02:37:53.816 --> 02:38:00.181]  I'm a law and order guy, but we've even got all these laws where it's all about money.
[02:38:00.881 --> 02:38:04.044]  Well, Al, do you know what happened to the man who they killed's wife?
[02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:07.761]  No, I didn't hear the rest of that story.
[02:38:07.821 --> 02:38:08.462]  They were threats.
[02:38:08.482 --> 02:38:09.762]  You said she was getting threats.
[02:38:10.243 --> 02:38:12.984]  She started suing them, and somebody firebombed her house.
[02:38:13.785 --> 02:38:24.490]  Well, it doesn't surprise me because, of course, the eco-terrorists, they watch all this stuff, and they've got their own little axe to grind with the Wildlands Project.
[02:38:24.550 --> 02:38:26.071]  I'm sure you guys have talked about it yet.
[02:38:27.068 --> 02:38:28.429]  And that's all right out of the U.N.
[02:38:28.490 --> 02:38:32.694]  So again, I keep throwing stuff out at you, Al, but what are some of the good points?
[02:38:33.474 --> 02:38:37.178]  Go back to that story you said that is kind of a silver lining.
[02:38:38.339 --> 02:38:38.860]  Dwayne Hates?
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:39.681]  Yes.
[02:38:40.301 --> 02:38:46.848]  Well, they went up to his ranch and he went out one day to work on his right-of-way, his water rights right-of-way, and
[02:38:48.633 --> 02:38:58.001]  The Forest Service was out there, and they arrested him while he was cutting brush on the right-of-way, which he owned and he had a perfect right to maintain.
[02:38:58.462 --> 02:38:59.763]  And that's when this all started.
[02:38:59.823 --> 02:39:05.348]  He's been fighting them now for about 18 years, I think, and maybe 15.
[02:39:06.368 --> 02:39:07.409]  It's been a long time.
[02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:11.453]  The man dedicated himself to this, and he's a great patriot.
[02:39:12.105 --> 02:39:18.190]  But it's taken him 15 years to get this to a trial date, and the court claims to see what he was going to get.
[02:39:18.731 --> 02:39:28.199]  But the courts have consistently ruled in his favor that water is property that's compensable, and that the forage that's attached to the water ride is also compensable.
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:35.585]  So at some point, if he wins, then this will sting him pretty good.
[02:39:37.361 --> 02:39:45.127]  Now, again, it's about setting the precedent that the government and their minions, their NGOs, their private pirates, own everybody's land.
[02:39:46.568 --> 02:39:48.429]  Well, they probably do.
[02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:55.914]  I mean, the courts are going to rule in their favor because there's something else going on that's even a little more insidious than that.
[02:39:56.415 --> 02:39:57.235]  Well, tell us about it.
[02:39:58.116 --> 02:40:01.058]  Well, there's a book called 200 Million Custers.
[02:40:03.317 --> 02:40:17.903]  And what it talks about in this book is how the Indian tribes, like the tribe, I think it was the Penobscots up in Maine, they brought a lawsuit against the federal government for violation of the treaties that they had signed with the federal government.
[02:40:18.103 --> 02:40:20.584]  And they won in federal court.
[02:40:21.545 --> 02:40:28.487]  And, of course, the state of Maine, Banger and all of the housing and housing developments and the industry, it's all there.
[02:40:28.607 --> 02:40:32.329]  And all the titles in the state of Maine are guaranteed by the government.
[02:40:33.010 --> 02:40:37.892]  And so the government told the Indian tribe, they said, well, you know, we can't let you just take all this land back.
[02:40:37.932 --> 02:40:39.033]  We're going to have to pay you.
[02:40:39.993 --> 02:40:41.694]  I think they paid them $20 billion.
[02:40:41.734 --> 02:40:42.995]  I don't remember just what it was.
[02:40:43.075 --> 02:40:43.755]  I could look it up.
[02:40:43.795 --> 02:40:46.256]  They paid them a pretty fantastic amount of money over time.
[02:40:46.836 --> 02:40:49.177]  And, of course, the real Native Americans never see that money.
[02:40:49.918 --> 02:40:54.280]  Well, yeah, now that's the political process within the various tribes.
[02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:55.420]  Some of them do very well.
[02:40:55.460 --> 02:40:56.641]  Some of them not so well.
[02:40:56.701 --> 02:40:59.482]  You know, I've seen some of them that really manage their affairs.
[02:40:59.502 --> 02:41:00.283]  They're like any other tribe.
[02:41:01.613 --> 02:41:02.815]  We're good to go.
[02:41:11.114 --> 02:41:23.180]  You see, in New Mexico, we have a lot of lands that were granted by the King of Spain, and they were always thought to be the best title you could get.
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:29.363]  And now they're trying to tell people who have a title from Spain, some of the Spanish families, that they can't have their land.
[02:41:29.383 --> 02:41:30.043]  Tell them about that.
[02:41:30.624 --> 02:41:30.884]  Well...
[02:41:32.404 --> 02:41:34.906]  I will, but I wanted to make this one point.
[02:41:35.306 --> 02:41:38.567]  Everybody always thought the best title you could get was a Spanish land grant.
[02:41:38.987 --> 02:41:45.391]  But really, the best title you can get is to buy the underlying right of the Native Americans that were here first.
[02:41:45.971 --> 02:41:54.415]  And the federal government is going around and they're quietly settling these court cases with the Native Americans, paying them off with money, and now they own the underlying right.
[02:41:55.094 --> 02:41:57.736]  The very rock bottom right under everything.
[02:41:57.776 --> 02:42:06.322]  So I think in a lot of cases the federal government really does believe they own all the land, which is about as perverse as it gets.
[02:42:07.003 --> 02:42:07.683]  Well, I've said it.
[02:42:07.703 --> 02:42:09.245]  Vicente Fox doesn't own Texas.
[02:42:09.265 --> 02:42:11.907]  If anybody does, it was the American Indians that were here.
[02:42:12.567 --> 02:42:17.351]  But yeah, we've got a Spanish land grant on our property in East Texas.
[02:42:17.451 --> 02:42:18.471]  But you're saying that...
[02:42:20.603 --> 02:42:23.387]  There's not a lot of tribal land in Texas though to go to the Indians.
[02:42:23.628 --> 02:42:35.366]  Well, but I don't think the point is so much that the tribes are going to court and winning and attempting to get what was due them in the first place.
[02:42:35.866 --> 02:42:42.631]  I think the underlying idea, or the thing, the danger is, is the federal government really believes now that they own everything.
[02:42:42.771 --> 02:42:46.013]  And to give folks an idea, what, they own 90% of Nevada now?
[02:42:47.153 --> 02:42:53.317]  Well, yeah, if you're governor of Nevada, you're only going to be governor over 17% of the state.
[02:42:55.257 --> 02:42:59.858]  So, you know, the rest of it is what they call federal lands.
[02:43:00.899 --> 02:43:04.660]  I guess the feds like to call them public lands, but that's a misnomer.
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:06.160]  They're really split state lands.
[02:43:06.220 --> 02:43:11.902]  But we really do have a serious situation in the West.
[02:43:13.103 --> 02:43:16.063]  But these things are happening in Texas as well.
[02:43:16.664 --> 02:43:24.146]  You look at New Mexico when the environmentalists wanted to use the Endangered Species Act to stop logging and mining and construction and all that.
[02:43:24.747 --> 02:43:25.348]  State and cities.
[02:43:25.368 --> 02:43:26.109]  State and cities.
[02:43:44.728 --> 02:43:46.208]  Maybe more so.
[02:43:46.428 --> 02:43:47.829]  They use city laws, too.
[02:43:47.949 --> 02:43:48.509]  County laws.
[02:43:48.629 --> 02:43:49.889]  Oh, yeah.
[02:43:50.009 --> 02:43:57.891]  But you see, the Endangered Species Act is such a powerful law that they can use it anywhere to good effect.
[02:43:58.011 --> 02:44:00.231]  Okay, Al, just two more quick questions.
[02:44:00.251 --> 02:44:02.072]  We're going to let you go, and I really appreciate you coming on.
[02:44:03.832 --> 02:44:05.012]  They've been caught in Colorado.
[02:44:05.032 --> 02:44:06.713]  They've been caught in the Dakotas.
[02:44:06.733 --> 02:44:07.733]  They've been caught in Texas.
[02:44:07.753 --> 02:44:09.293]  They've been caught everywhere.
[02:44:09.333 --> 02:44:13.614]  People are getting arrested for killing rattlesnakes in their yards now when the things are all over the place.
[02:44:14.457 --> 02:44:17.379]  They've been caught though planning so-called endangered species.
[02:44:17.419 --> 02:44:19.360]  They've admitted it and then nobody goes to jail.
[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:20.521]  Where are those cases going?
[02:44:21.201 --> 02:44:22.442]  I don't think they're going to go anywhere.
[02:44:24.023 --> 02:44:34.489]  I haven't seen any will coming out of Congress to supervise or to hold these people accountable at all.
[02:44:34.589 --> 02:44:39.272]  I mean, bureaucracy is such a terrible phenomenon.
[02:44:39.292 --> 02:44:41.313]  A bureaucrat will do nothing.
[02:44:42.180 --> 02:44:44.981]  If he thinks he's going to suffer any consequence at all.
[02:44:45.101 --> 02:44:49.102]  So you have to absolutely protect a bureaucrat from any consequences.
[02:44:49.582 --> 02:44:53.143]  Because if these other bureaucrats... See, I go to work every day.
[02:44:53.243 --> 02:44:58.045]  I can't get too far out ahead, and I've got to do enough to justify my existence.
[02:44:58.105 --> 02:44:58.845]  And you do, too.
[02:44:59.545 --> 02:45:03.766]  But these bureaucrats, they can go to work day after day, and they don't have to do anything.
[02:45:04.226 --> 02:45:05.307]  And they won't lose their job.
[02:45:05.367 --> 02:45:09.208]  They're not exposed to the reality of life like you and I are.
[02:45:10.151 --> 02:45:14.495]  So they'll transfer them, but they won't fire them.
[02:45:16.216 --> 02:45:23.222]  Well, we need to all get involved, learn the law, stand up to them from the beginning, take over our counties and cities and states, and throw these people out.
[02:45:23.282 --> 02:45:30.408]  And paragon.org, and that phone number again for folks that want to get some information from Paragon.
[02:45:30.749 --> 02:45:31.810]  Yeah, just a second.
[02:45:32.070 --> 02:45:32.310]  It's 505-434-3195.
[02:45:37.449 --> 02:45:38.890]  And that'll get you to the main office.
[02:45:39.210 --> 02:45:44.233]  Well, Al Sneberger, thank you so much for coming on the show, and God bless you, my friend.
[02:45:44.273 --> 02:45:44.934]  Thank you, sir.
[02:45:45.214 --> 02:45:45.594]  You bet.
[02:45:45.614 --> 02:45:46.034]  Take care.
[02:45:47.175 --> 02:45:48.216]  Another great American.
[02:45:48.816 --> 02:45:51.077]  Who's my next caller there, Mark, you were saying?
[02:45:52.238 --> 02:45:53.279]  Who should I go to next?
[02:45:54.159 --> 02:45:55.360]  Lorraine in California.
[02:45:55.380 --> 02:45:56.401]  Go ahead, and thanks for holding.
[02:45:56.441 --> 02:45:57.641]  You're welcome.
[02:45:57.801 --> 02:46:01.784]  I wanted to mention about the movie, The Passion, you know, the movie from Gibson?
[02:46:02.064 --> 02:46:05.286]  Yeah, being demonized about the last 12 hours of Christ's life.
[02:46:05.697 --> 02:46:15.903]  Well, I have a different look on it and, you know, because we're all, you know, different and independent Christians, whatever, but they have an Illuminati icon in the beginning of the movie.
[02:46:17.343 --> 02:46:18.204]  Have you noticed that?
[02:46:19.471 --> 02:46:32.703]  Well, I haven't seen the film, but I know Icon Productions is a face, like a medieval face, looking at you, and then it disappears into the background.
[02:46:33.304 --> 02:46:41.672]  Well, it's the left eye, and Zachariah talks about the idol shepherd, and the right eye is darkened, and if you watch the trailer...
[02:46:42.489 --> 02:46:49.315]  Jesus' right eye is shut, where it's been hit, and then the left eye starts rolling around, and it's like weird.
[02:46:50.016 --> 02:46:56.141]  And I know he got demonized, but at the same time, it's not something I, as a Protestant, would support.
[02:46:57.583 --> 02:46:59.104]  Well, I know the Gibsons are good people.
[02:46:59.164 --> 02:47:00.405]  They're listeners of this show.
[02:47:01.086 --> 02:47:01.386]  Yeah.
[02:47:01.526 --> 02:47:02.747]  And I know they've seen the films.
[02:47:02.807 --> 02:47:05.790]  I know Mel Gibson's done a lot of good work with The Patriot and Braveheart and
[02:47:06.793 --> 02:47:23.785]  He tries to, I mean, I look at the fruits of what they've done, and they're doing good work, so I would have to disagree with you, but I do know about the symbol for Icon Productions, and it's a face of, it's like a cracked old wall painting.
[02:47:24.454 --> 02:47:28.057]  Well, this one, when you look at the trailer, it has just the eye.
[02:47:28.478 --> 02:47:32.301]  Like, you know how the pyramid on the back of the dollar has just an eye on top of it?
[02:47:32.341 --> 02:47:36.585]  Yeah, that's a classic symbol of the New World Order, but I haven't seen what you're talking about.
[02:47:36.905 --> 02:47:40.389]  So you just saw the trailer on TV?
[02:47:40.769 --> 02:47:41.670]  I saw it on the Internet.
[02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:44.172]  Somebody posted it on the Internet, and I checked it out.
[02:47:44.653 --> 02:47:46.474]  And so I saw that, and I saw the part.
[02:47:46.554 --> 02:47:47.075]  And then...
[02:47:47.967 --> 02:47:51.090]  I saw something that looked out of place, but I couldn't figure it out.
[02:47:51.551 --> 02:47:59.438]  It looked like somebody Jewish out of the 21st century going to throw a rock or something at him.
[02:47:59.478 --> 02:48:01.960]  But it was so cut off, I couldn't really see it.
[02:48:01.980 --> 02:48:04.503]  It just looked out of place to me.
[02:48:04.523 --> 02:48:07.165]  Man, I'm totally confused now.
[02:48:07.265 --> 02:48:09.648]  You're saying it looks like a Jewish person throwing a rock?
[02:48:10.068 --> 02:48:11.870]  Yeah, I couldn't see the whole thing.
[02:48:12.643 --> 02:48:15.505]  And so I guess the person has to make their own opinion on that.
[02:48:15.525 --> 02:48:18.987]  But as far as the Illuminati connection, I can see it.
[02:48:19.167 --> 02:48:25.850]  Well, I don't want to say that without the... I mean, you say it was somebody in, like, modern clothes throwing a rock.
[02:48:26.051 --> 02:48:28.352]  Well, like, they have the curls and stuff.
[02:48:28.992 --> 02:48:34.495]  And I have heard, like, they have the curls and stuff that, you know, like you'd see in Brooklyn and stuff.
[02:48:35.316 --> 02:48:35.676]  And the...
[02:48:36.804 --> 02:48:42.266]  I only could see it so fast, but that's what it looked like to me, so I don't want to make a total opinion on that.
[02:48:42.346 --> 02:48:43.607]  I've got to let you go.
[02:48:43.647 --> 02:48:44.187]  We've got to break.
[02:48:44.247 --> 02:48:44.867]  Thank you for the call.
[02:48:44.887 --> 02:48:45.528]  I appreciate it.
[02:48:45.568 --> 02:48:58.633]  Look, I know that when I made 911 emergency release, we just offered it for a few months, I started the video with an image of a giant pyramid going up behind me, and I said, the New World Order is upon us.
[02:48:59.473 --> 02:49:03.535]  I got all these emails, I don't know, like 10 emails, probably 10 calls over the months it was out,
[02:49:04.292 --> 02:49:05.433]  We're good to go.
[02:49:34.184 --> 02:49:38.527]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:38.707 --> 02:49:43.130]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:43.290 --> 02:49:47.653]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:49:47.693 --> 02:49:49.014]  The New World Order.
[02:49:50.829 --> 02:49:55.054]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:55.114 --> 02:50:02.064]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:50:02.184 --> 02:50:04.226]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:50:04.587 --> 02:50:07.651]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[02:50:07.811 --> 02:50:14.913]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
