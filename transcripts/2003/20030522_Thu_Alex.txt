[00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:07.429]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:15.673]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.313 --> 00:00:17.414]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:19.255]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:20.695]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:22.316]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:26.918]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:31.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:34.142]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:34.182 --> 00:00:37.143]  It's already the 22nd of May, 2003.
[00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:52.152]  I'm Alex Jones, your host on this live Thursday, worldwide edition, as we go out on the AM and FM dials, simulcast on the Internet, at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:53.312 --> 00:00:58.175]  And on Global Shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20 from 11 to 2 Central and back from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:00:58.215 --> 00:00:59.836]  Again, thank you for joining me today.
[00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:00.916]  Big, big show lined up.
[00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:14.137]  Tomorrow, I have Jim Tucker from American Free Press joining us.
[00:01:14.177 --> 00:01:38.317]  He just got back from France, where Donald Rumsfeld and Richard Pearl and everyone else were meeting to get their orders from the Europeans, all part of this staged fight as they engage in the military takeover of sovereign nations under the orders of their banker masters and as they drive down the dollar purposely in everyone's face.
[00:01:39.418 --> 00:01:42.020]  A blast has hit Istanbul restaurant.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.504]  The second bombing in Turkey since the weekend, the last five days.
[00:01:49.044 --> 00:01:56.229]  Also, the FBI is quizzing Yale students after a bomb of some type went off in the Yale Law School.
[00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.652]  Of course, Yale is Bush's skull and bones alma mater.
[00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:03.514]  He was in the state surveying his troops.
[00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:08.296]  And we'll cover that situation for you.
[00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:13.997]  Also, world shuns Canadian beef over mad cow fears as that spreads.
[00:02:15.278 --> 00:02:23.800]  Federal government says that SARS is going to spread real bad probably next winter, and they may have to lock everything down and forcibly inject you, but that's okay.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.300]  They love you.
[00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.070]  Military on highest domestic terror threat alert.
[00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.190]  They're on the highest alert, but the general public is on an orange alert.
[00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.651]  We'll get to that out of the Washington Post.
[00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:38.792]  An earthquake kills more than 640 in Algeria.
[00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:42.372]  A Tarrytown judge remarked sparks outrage.
[00:02:42.472 --> 00:02:45.313]  A Muslim woman had gotten two parking tickets.
[00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:46.413]  She came in to see the judge.
[00:02:46.453 --> 00:02:48.713]  He said, are you a terrorist?
[00:02:48.773 --> 00:02:50.274]  And she fainted in fear.
[00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:52.514]  This shows the insanity of the government.
[00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:57.513]  Also, allies to begin seizing weapons from most Iraqis.
[00:02:57.573 --> 00:03:00.954]  Gun confiscation is beginning, something Saddam didn't do.
[00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:07.677]  Also, Iraqi conference to choose interim authority delayed because of all the looting and problems.
[00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:14.260]  And that's just the puppet group they're going to be appointing.
[00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:18.908]  So we'll be covering the facets of that for you.
[00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:22.010]  Schrock to embarrass Bush at G8 conference.
[00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.892]  Again, more of this stage left-right fight that's going on.
[00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:32.218]  The New York Times, two paths of Bayer drug in the 80s, riskier type, went overseas.
[00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:35.901]  That was the blood product full of the HIV and hepatitis.
[00:03:36.422 --> 00:03:37.663]  Our government knew what was in it.
[00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:38.904]  It was coming out of the prisons.
[00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:50.215]  Bill Clinton was involved in the front lines of making money off this, and it caused hundreds of thousands to get AIDS and hepatitis C and B. Again, here's that article I mentioned earlier.
[00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:53.537]  SARS outbreak could flare this winter, experts warn.
[00:03:54.197 --> 00:03:56.918]  Two more farms quarantined in Mad Cow Probe.
[00:03:57.118 --> 00:04:00.940]  FDA shots are approved to neuter puppies.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.284]  Now, the UN's already been caught in Africa and other third world sectors of the global slave system.
[00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:10.122]  We're good to go.
[00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:36.409]  With the pathogen, the tetanus, the hepatitis, whatever, the body then just doesn't attack the tetanus or the hepatitis or the MMR.
[00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:45.454]  It will attack the hormone whenever it shows up in the body when the mammal goes into puberty and starts its reproductive jump point.
[00:04:46.437 --> 00:04:47.458]  That's coming up as well.
[00:04:48.098 --> 00:04:49.399]  I haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.020]  Big show for you today.
[00:04:52.621 --> 00:04:53.241]  Stay with us.
[00:04:53.521 --> 00:05:01.486]  I'm Alex E. Jones, right here in Austin, Texas, hooked in with the great folks at Genesis Communications up in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[00:05:02.307 --> 00:05:06.069]  We'll be right back with more of the news, your calls, and a bunch of guests today.
[00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:08.891]  Stay with me, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:18.413]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:05:18.653 --> 00:05:23.015]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:32.219]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.041]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:36.802]  We're good to go.
[00:05:36.842 --> 00:05:37.042]  I think?
[00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:55.538]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:05:55.578 --> 00:05:56.679]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.661]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:17.861]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:18.121 --> 00:06:22.866]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:23.087 --> 00:06:28.753]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:33.495]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:06:33.716 --> 00:06:40.879]  The casual society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:45.442]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:06:45.602 --> 00:06:48.123]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:06:48.343 --> 00:06:55.047]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:06:55.347 --> 00:06:55.608]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:09.275 --> 00:07:11.056]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:11.236 --> 00:07:16.879]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.060]  Probably never, right?
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.402]  Hey, folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.
[00:07:21.662 --> 00:07:24.103]  He's the owner and founder of the Cal Bend Soap Company.
[00:07:24.223 --> 00:07:31.527]  For the past 55 years, the Cal Bend Soap Company has been making triple-concentrated pure soaps exclusively for health care professionals and hospitals.
[00:07:31.747 --> 00:07:35.509]  Now for the first time, Cal Bend Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:38.811]  Cal Bend Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:40.491]  It's earth-friendly and it's safe.
[00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:43.473]  Call the Cal Bend Soap Company today toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:43.553 --> 00:07:43.773]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:45.974]  Save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.

[00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:05.045]  That web address again is calbinpuresoap.com.
[00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:08.167]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.251]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:13.812 --> 00:08:16.694]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.714 --> 00:08:25.140]  There have been more bombings...
[00:08:26.175 --> 00:08:28.757]  A restaurant got bombed in Istanbul, Turkey.
[00:08:28.797 --> 00:08:30.258]  The second bombing in a week there.
[00:08:30.278 --> 00:08:49.570]  Some type of small bomb went off in a classroom at Yale, where one of the emperor's daughters goes, as well as the emperor himself went there, there at the globalist training ground, there at the Order of Death, Skull and Bones.
[00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.632]  We'll talk about that, the dollar plunging even more.
[00:08:54.119 --> 00:09:01.045]  The globalists are greedily destroying our economy with pleasure, and the public is thanking the government for it during the Orange Alert.
[00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:06.809]  They are training us with news images everywhere of troops on the streets equating with safety.
[00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:14.075]  They are saying SARS is going to hit us hard next winter, and they may have to take all our rights away and forcibly inject us.
[00:09:14.516 --> 00:09:22.002]  This giant bureaucracy of martial law is using these crises as a pretext to unfold and establish itself.
[00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.693]  Yesterday I read an article, MMR kids five times more likely to develop autism.
[00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:40.002]  Fears over the safety of the MMR vaccine were reignited yesterday after a controversial study claimed it put children at a much greater risk of neurological disorders, not just autism, but brain damage.
[00:09:42.006 --> 00:09:46.367]  And autism is up over 3,000% in England, 2,000% in this country.
[00:09:46.407 --> 00:09:49.168]  People take their babies to get the vaccines at 18 months.
[00:09:49.308 --> 00:09:51.348]  They're happily talking to their mommy and daddy.
[00:09:51.428 --> 00:09:53.009]  Hours later, they're in convulsions.
[00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:56.189]  Many cases die and many cases are brain damage for life.
[00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.570]  Across the board, though, you do have an IQ reduction in your children.
[00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:06.612]  It is hormones that are being added and other chemicals that attack the cerebral cortex during key development zones.
[00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:09.580]  But they're not just attacking that.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:27.389]  There is an article today that we need to discuss because I've been reporting on this for about four years now since I first learned of it when the United Nations got caught carrying this out in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
[00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.031]  It is a CNN story.
[00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:35.513]  It says FDA approves shot to neuter puppies.
[00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:39.749]  FDA approves shot to neuter puppies.
[00:10:39.829 --> 00:11:00.133]  Now, the United Nations was caught in a program that was only for the women, because the UN cares so much for the women, it was all couched in feminist terms, that tetanus inoculations were to be given by the UN, and countries were paid off to carry these out,
[00:11:02.145 --> 00:11:08.991]  And in some cases, UN troops actually did the injecting to the point now where Africa refuses most of the injections and refuses the genetically modified food.
[00:11:09.011 --> 00:11:09.992]  They don't trust anything.
[00:11:10.352 --> 00:11:12.374]  If Africa can figure it out, why can't we?
[00:11:14.355 --> 00:11:27.106]  They would give the women the injections and millions of them were then sterilized and then they tested some of the shots, some of the inoculations, and found that a key hormone had been added to the tetanus pathogen.
[00:11:27.657 --> 00:11:50.641]  That way, when the body became immune to the tetanus shot from the inoculation, it would also associate the tetanus with the hormone, and when the young girl would go into puberty and would become pregnant, she would be unable to carry the baby past the first few months and would have a violent miscarriage because the body did not have the hormone because the immune system would attack the glands that produce it.
[00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:56.882]  It's a horrible system, cause massive illnesses, not just the sterilization.
[00:11:57.788 --> 00:12:03.533]  Well, I remember hearing about this four and a half years ago, maybe five years ago, when the UN got caught doing this.
[00:12:03.553 --> 00:12:05.015]  It was in the back of a few newspapers.
[00:12:05.355 --> 00:12:06.576]  They claimed it was an accident.
[00:12:06.596 --> 00:12:08.678]  Of course, it wouldn't have hurt men.
[00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:11.120]  But the program wasn't for men.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.581]  It just so happened to be for women.
[00:12:12.882 --> 00:12:20.108]  And the UN said that in 130 countries they did it, that they just added the female hormone by accident, a very expensive synthetic hormone.
[00:12:20.368 --> 00:12:26.950]  Harmone, dozens of different manufacturers, they all just accidentally added this to the tetanus shot.
[00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.371]  If you want to believe that, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:12:30.631 --> 00:12:35.793]  And of course, the UN at the same time is saying they've got to reduce world population, got to sterilize people.
[00:12:35.833 --> 00:12:42.375]  We have government reports from Australia, the UK, the US, about plans in the 50s calling for programs along these lines.
[00:12:42.755 --> 00:12:46.876]  We know the globalists are obsessed with population reduction, and lo and behold, it happens.
[00:12:48.277 --> 00:12:48.817]  We're good to go.
[00:13:07.666 --> 00:13:21.278]  And how it had a hormone added with another pathogen and the body would create an immunity and would attack the glands and so the animal cannot have puppies or cannot have kittens.
[00:13:22.339 --> 00:13:23.600]  But we're mammals too, folks.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.702]  That's what the UN's been doing and it's already in a lot of the vaccines.
[00:13:27.383 --> 00:13:31.967]  I know a lot of families, we're talking 30-year-old women, that cannot have children.
[00:13:33.058 --> 00:13:33.659]  We're good to go.
[00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:34.139]  We're good to go.
[00:13:49.017 --> 00:13:50.519]  It is massive.
[00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:52.441]  Absolutely massive.
[00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:54.583]  Just keep taking your vaccines, folks.
[00:13:54.663 --> 00:13:55.524]  If you do, you're nuts.
[00:13:56.065 --> 00:13:56.465]  Here it is.
[00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:58.267]  FDA-approved shot to neuter puppies.
[00:13:58.627 --> 00:14:02.031]  Veterinarians now can offer an alternative to surgery to neuter puppies.
[00:14:02.151 --> 00:14:03.673]  Oh, yeah, I'm sure this is real good for your dogs.
[00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:06.476]  Yeah, having the body attack glands.
[00:14:06.876 --> 00:14:08.498]  No, that's really a kind of cancer.
[00:14:08.518 --> 00:14:08.678]  Cold.
[00:14:12.299 --> 00:14:19.066]  Neutersol, it's a shot administered directly into the testicles of puppies at the right age for neutering.
[00:14:19.546 --> 00:14:26.814]  The ingredients, the amino acid I-arginine and zinc salt cause the testicles and prostate to atrophy.
[00:14:26.854 --> 00:14:31.939]  So this is just injecting an acid into them, basically, not the hormonal injection.
[00:14:32.699 --> 00:14:40.204]  Because I guess if you did that to dogs, then there would be the miscarriages around the house or the yard.
[00:14:40.244 --> 00:14:41.145]  You don't really want that.
[00:14:41.165 --> 00:14:42.226]  We just do that to humans.
[00:14:43.766 --> 00:14:47.507]  And it says, the alternative, surgically removing the testicles, guarantees sterility.
[00:14:47.547 --> 00:14:51.529]  In a study of 224 dogs, Nutrasol did almost as well.
[00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:58.951]  Semen analysis showed only one sterilization failure, said Dr. Madeline Burson of the Food and Drug Administration.
[00:14:58.971 --> 00:15:03.213]  The FDA approved Nutrasol in March, but did not announce the approval until Monday.
[00:15:03.273 --> 00:15:06.674]  Again, the stuff I saw in Dog Fancy was the hormone sterilization system.
[00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:10.810]  A type of chemical castration already is available for humans.
[00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:17.932]  Sex offenders often are sentenced to regular injections of hormones to deplete the testosterone, but that's not permanent sterilization.
[00:15:18.512 --> 00:15:25.434]  The new method for dogs is permanent, but some testosterone production continues because it's not hormonally driven.
[00:15:25.854 --> 00:15:34.197]  Burson said, so unlike surgically castration, Nucrosol may not eliminate unwanted male behavior such as roaming, marking, and aggression, the FDA warned.
[00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:42.739]  Now, understand, the UN was caught two years ago in Peru engaging in forced castrations.
[00:15:43.219 --> 00:15:45.781]  They still do the castration instead of just cutting the tubes.
[00:15:46.676 --> 00:15:47.016]  We're good to go.
[00:15:47.036 --> 00:15:47.456]  We're good to go.
[00:16:16.332 --> 00:16:19.437]  There's a big move globally for a one-child policy.
[00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:28.452]  And you look at all the loss and fertility and other factors, much of that is the garbage and the food, the genetically engineered trash, fluoride, the chlorine in the water.
[00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:41.902]  The dioxin from old plastics manufacturing in any plastic bag that your child's eating, a honey bun or something out of, or those hot dogs you put in the microwave.
[00:16:41.942 --> 00:16:43.322]  There's massive estrogen.
[00:16:43.862 --> 00:16:46.683]  That's why your boys will grow breasts.
[00:16:46.703 --> 00:16:49.944]  That's why your young girls at eight years old now are going into puberty.
[00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:51.605]  It's killing us.
[00:16:52.225 --> 00:16:54.205]  This is the real environmental crisis.
[00:16:54.445 --> 00:16:56.006]  Nothing's being done to address it.
[00:16:56.795 --> 00:17:06.544]  They're doing much of it on purpose, but they'll take your ranch or farm saying there's a golden-cheeked warbler bird or a cave bug or a owl.
[00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:08.866]  It's amazing.
[00:17:09.206 --> 00:17:12.189]  And the right wing is working with the left wing to get your property.
[00:17:12.209 --> 00:17:13.310]  They're all in it together.
[00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:17.854]  They have rhetoric and have fights on the surface, but beneath the surface, they're all together.
[00:17:18.774 --> 00:17:22.678]  But again, MMR kids five times more likely to develop autism.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:36.071]  And the American study published in the medical journal International Pediatrics added that there was also a marked increase in other neurological disorders such as brain damage and mental retardation in children who receive the MMR vaccine.
[00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:39.193]  And they say as opposed to the DTP jag.
[00:17:39.594 --> 00:17:42.236]  Now they say give the shots individually.
[00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:43.377]  That's a shill story.
[00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:45.079]  Like, oh, it's the MMR that's bad.
[00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:46.500]  Take your shots individually.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.221]  You'll be okay.
[00:17:48.453 --> 00:17:54.075]  This government admittedly has sprayed our troops thousands of times with deadly biologicals.
[00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:56.136]  They've sprayed almost every major state and city.
[00:17:57.036 --> 00:17:58.317]  Admitted mainstream news.
[00:17:58.717 --> 00:17:59.858]  It's all in my new film.
[00:18:01.018 --> 00:18:02.639]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:18:03.159 --> 00:18:04.259]  We have their documents.
[00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:07.241]  This is admitted eugenics attack on you.
[00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:09.361]  We are under attack, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:09.802]  Repeat.
[00:18:10.182 --> 00:18:13.023]  We are under massive, unprecedented attack.
[00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:23.136]  This government, this global government, is so criminally insane, so ruthless, so wicked, they practice darkness like a doctor practices medicine.
[00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:33.402]  And now under Bush's new initiative, they will have $10 billion a year to forcibly inject you with dozens of different pathogens to protect you from the bio-threat.
[00:18:33.422 --> 00:18:35.864]  There's going to be lots of bio-scares as they...
[00:18:36.525 --> 00:18:43.788]  Concentrically lock us down in our cities, drive us off the rural areas into the control grid so they can have our way with us.
[00:18:44.448 --> 00:18:48.269]  Humanity is under unprecedented Nazi attack.
[00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:55.072]  Eugenics, Malthusian social Darwinists are in control.
[00:18:55.212 --> 00:18:56.232]  We must resist.
[00:18:56.272 --> 00:18:57.613]  We must fight the New World Order.
[00:18:58.863 --> 00:19:06.709]  I'm going to take calls early in the hour because we've got a guest joining us from the United Kingdom who runs Bilderberg.org, an expert on the New World Order.
[00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:13.394]  Tomorrow we've got Big Jim Tucker, formerly with the Spotlight, now American Free Press, joining us to talk about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:19:14.475 --> 00:19:15.296]  That's coming up.
[00:19:16.276 --> 00:19:17.377]  You don't want to miss that.
[00:19:17.697 --> 00:19:21.020]  And I'm working on getting Michael Haga on the show, the international...
[00:19:22.206 --> 00:19:26.388]  Forecaster to talk about the plunging dollar, the economy, and the rest of it.
[00:19:26.448 --> 00:19:29.669]  We'll take calls early in this hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:29.809 --> 00:19:38.852]  I'm glad no one was hurt in the blast at the Yale Law School.
[00:19:38.892 --> 00:19:40.373]  What a convenient activity.
[00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:42.054]  I wonder if Scullum Bones was involved.
[00:19:42.634 --> 00:19:48.916]  You know, the Carlaw Group formerly owned the company, and it was still a CIA front, the stuff that got bombed over in Saudi Arabia.
[00:19:49.636 --> 00:19:50.977]  Who stands to gain from this?
[00:19:51.846 --> 00:19:52.487]  We have a U.S.
[00:19:52.507 --> 00:19:57.592]  government document called Northwoods where they tell us they want to carry out bombings to scare the public into submission.
[00:19:57.632 --> 00:20:01.096]  So I look to those that have confessed to what they're doing.
[00:20:01.897 --> 00:20:03.419]  Yes, I look at a confession.
[00:20:03.859 --> 00:20:04.840]  A public confession.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.242]  And that's my suspect.
[00:20:06.562 --> 00:20:07.463]  Ooh, how radical.
[00:20:07.523 --> 00:20:08.224]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:12.532 --> 00:20:13.052]  It's here.
[00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:14.033]  It's powerful.
[00:20:14.353 --> 00:20:22.918]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.218 --> 00:20:25.059]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:27.400]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.922]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[00:20:32.202 --> 00:20:37.905]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[00:20:38.085 --> 00:20:39.866]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[00:20:40.026 --> 00:20:43.247]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[00:20:43.447 --> 00:20:45.008]  Get the powerful Berkey now.

[00:22:09.306 --> 00:22:13.590]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:18.574]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:22:18.954 --> 00:22:23.818]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:22:24.198 --> 00:22:25.980]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.060]  can barely be read.
[00:22:27.341 --> 00:22:28.321]  It has faded that much.
[00:22:28.662 --> 00:22:32.545]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[00:22:32.805 --> 00:22:41.191]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.
[00:22:41.451 --> 00:22:49.316]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95 shipping included.

[00:23:03.473 --> 00:23:03.913]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:23:09.435 --> 00:23:09.936]  Hello, buddy.
[00:23:09.996 --> 00:23:15.562]  My name is Bob Barefoot, and I'm here today to introduce Bob Barefoot's Best Coral Calcium Supreme Plus.
[00:23:15.762 --> 00:23:22.690]  It has twice as much of the high-grade marine coral calcium from Okinawa, Japan, and almost twice as much of all other nutrients.
[00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:29.418]  Today, it's the best bang for your buck in the health nutrients industry, and coral calcium is the nutrient of the 21st century.
[00:23:29.938 --> 00:23:30.198]  That's 1-800-510-4074
[00:23:56.327 --> 00:24:01.571]  Robert Barefoot wants to help your body heal itself today, so call toll-free 800-510-4074 or visit www.robertbarefoot.com.
[00:24:01.591 --> 00:24:03.192]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:24:25.658 --> 00:24:40.531]  You've got social engineers who just so happen to be criminally insane control freaks who are sadistic, who publicly say in their own reports, their own policy papers, that their main goal is to sterilize you to reduce world population by 80 to 95%.
[00:24:40.651 --> 00:24:47.356]  And it's not just Prince Philip and Ted Turner and Jacques Cousteau who make these type of comments.
[00:24:47.396 --> 00:24:48.257]  It's the UN.
[00:24:50.099 --> 00:24:51.019]  It's our own government.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.781]  It's what they push for.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.224]  This is a real discussion that people are not having that they should be having.
[00:24:57.264 --> 00:25:05.653]  And we have a government that's been caught doing all these horrible tests on us in the last hundred years, right through to this year, telling us, oh, take your shots.
[00:25:05.673 --> 00:25:06.574]  It needs to be the law.
[00:25:06.614 --> 00:25:08.076]  We've got lots of shots for you.
[00:25:08.436 --> 00:25:09.557]  Oh, you don't want to take your shots?
[00:25:09.597 --> 00:25:11.279]  We'll just engineer it into the food.
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.721]  How does that sound?
[00:25:14.306 --> 00:25:16.928]  Meanwhile, blast hits Istanbul restaurant.
[00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:22.593]  See all these little bombings happening all over the place, getting the world behind the New World Order takeover?
[00:25:23.133 --> 00:25:28.858]  Explosion has rocked a restaurant in Istanbul, the capital of Turkey, or near the capital of Turkey, injuring at least two people.
[00:25:28.898 --> 00:25:32.821]  It was reported today it was not immediately clear what caused the explosion.
[00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:40.688]  CNN Turk said two people were injured, and investigators were looking into whether a cooking gas canister caused the blast.
[00:25:41.792 --> 00:25:43.673]  You know, there are natural gas explosions.
[00:25:43.753 --> 00:25:44.994]  Are these real terrorist attacks?
[00:25:45.074 --> 00:25:51.637]  The MTV television channel said at least six people had been pulled from the rubble at the site of the explosion.
[00:25:51.657 --> 00:25:53.318]  It was not clear if others remained trapped.
[00:25:53.358 --> 00:26:02.323]  Police were unable to confirm there had been an explosion in the district and upmarket neighborhood, dotted with cafes and hotels not far from Istanbul, scenic.
[00:26:02.941 --> 00:26:14.628]  Bosphorus Straits, the Reuters News Agency reported, bomb detonated in Anikar Cafe on Tuesday, killing a far-left suicide bomber and injuring one other person.
[00:26:15.148 --> 00:26:17.590]  Far-left suicide bomber?
[00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.772]  Now, is Al-Qaeda far-left or they were far-right?
[00:26:21.622 --> 00:26:24.963]  And, again, are these people being given packages?
[00:26:25.324 --> 00:26:26.204]  That's happened before.
[00:26:26.824 --> 00:26:32.206]  Again, we know the CIA had the right wing carry out and funded terrorist attacks in Italy in the 70s and 80s.
[00:26:32.606 --> 00:26:33.827]  They blame on the left wing.
[00:26:34.867 --> 00:26:37.588]  Again, whoever gets out of line, gets bombings, blamed on them.
[00:26:38.409 --> 00:26:40.710]  FBI quizzes Yale students.
[00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:46.612]  FBI agents are questioning students at the prestigious Yale University Law School after an explosion in an empty classroom.
[00:26:48.075 --> 00:26:48.796]  We're good to go.
[00:27:15.174 --> 00:27:19.204]  And his daughter Barbara currently attends university as an undergraduate student.
[00:27:19.224 --> 00:27:21.450]  Yeah, she'll be a Skull and Bones member by junior high.
[00:27:22.822 --> 00:27:23.222]  We're good to go.
[00:27:52.742 --> 00:27:53.242]  We're good to go.
[00:27:53.282 --> 00:27:53.983]  We're good to go.
[00:28:17.703 --> 00:28:23.126]  With Halliburton, nice smoke screen from the cholera spreading all over Iraq and the total breakdown of services.
[00:28:23.186 --> 00:28:26.508]  Nice smoke screen for the plunging dollar that our government's bad-mouthing.
[00:28:27.008 --> 00:28:30.730]  Nice smoke screen for the troops on the streets training us to accept a police state.
[00:28:31.631 --> 00:28:32.451]  What do you think about that?
[00:28:32.471 --> 00:28:35.593]  What do you think about Mad Cow in Canada?
[00:28:35.613 --> 00:28:37.714]  We know it's been in North America for a while.
[00:28:37.734 --> 00:28:42.477]  We know they feed blood and other tissue products to...
[00:28:44.898 --> 00:28:49.099]  Herbivores, animals that don't eat meat, much less rotten meat.
[00:28:49.719 --> 00:28:52.880]  World shuns Canadian beef over mad cow fears.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.841]  Where do you think this will land?
[00:28:54.881 --> 00:28:58.602]  You know they've carried out a lot of cover-ups here in Austin.
[00:28:58.622 --> 00:29:04.023]  I've seen the forms signed by doctors that mad cow in humans has killed people.
[00:29:04.183 --> 00:29:05.023]  I've seen it.
[00:29:05.504 --> 00:29:06.664]  No one will cover it in the news.
[00:29:06.704 --> 00:29:07.624]  What's really going on?
[00:29:08.004 --> 00:29:10.385]  World shuns Canadian beef over mad cow fears.
[00:29:11.576 --> 00:29:22.843]  The world slammed the door on Canadian beef and cattle Wednesday, fearing a mad cow disease outbreak as inspectors sealed off more farms while racing to trace the origin of the animal confirmed as the country's first case in a decade.
[00:29:22.863 --> 00:29:24.424]  Do you really believe that?
[00:29:24.825 --> 00:29:26.406]  Why did this story come out now?
[00:29:27.927 --> 00:29:30.428]  And do you know what they'll do under a mad cow breakout?
[00:29:30.448 --> 00:29:32.330]  Or do you know what they'll do under a foot-and-mouth breakout?
[00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.371]  They'll lock down all the farms nationwide.
[00:29:34.391 --> 00:29:35.312]  It's a federal plan.
[00:29:35.352 --> 00:29:36.392]  And kill your animals.
[00:29:36.532 --> 00:29:39.214]  An army will, quote, deliver food to your farm or ranch.
[00:29:39.374 --> 00:29:40.275]  Do you really believe that?
[00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:45.582]  That was in the Pioneer Press last year, two years ago, out of Minnesota.
[00:29:45.602 --> 00:29:46.823]  They set up martial law.
[00:29:46.883 --> 00:29:47.463]  That happens.
[00:29:48.024 --> 00:29:49.565]  What do you think about these issues?
[00:29:49.585 --> 00:29:50.005]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:50.085 --> 00:29:52.267]  Your calls when we get back at 800-259-9231.
[00:29:52.287 --> 00:29:52.988]  Stay with me.
[00:29:53.048 --> 00:29:53.928]  We're on the march.
[00:29:54.128 --> 00:29:55.329]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.349 --> 00:29:56.791]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:17.377]  As a listener to the Genesis Communications Network, you're aware of the many health dangers that have been unleashed upon an unsuspecting public.
[00:30:17.817 --> 00:30:21.200]  We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but how do we do that?
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:21.260]  888-803-4438.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.241]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:30:34.024 --> 00:30:39.327]  We're good to go.
[00:31:03.644 --> 00:31:07.688]  We have a link to it on Infowars.com being updated right now.
[00:31:08.528 --> 00:31:10.130]  And tomorrow I do have Big Jim Tucker.
[00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.933]  Jim Tucker from American Free Press joining us to talk about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:13.953 --> 00:31:17.777]  I guess it was the 26th time he has covered the group.
[00:31:18.757 --> 00:31:22.240]  In country, over there where the bosses lie, we had...
[00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:27.730]  Well, Rumsfeld and Richard Perl over there getting their orders from their bosses in Europe.
[00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:28.651]  It's totally staged.
[00:31:28.671 --> 00:31:29.771]  There's no fight between the U.S.
[00:31:29.811 --> 00:31:30.151]  and Europe.
[00:31:30.531 --> 00:31:35.333]  Europe owns our central banks and has ordered the death of the dollar, which is now taking place.
[00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:36.573]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:31:36.613 --> 00:31:42.315]  And a lot of the other news I haven't gotten to yet, but we're about to go straight to your calls.
[00:31:42.435 --> 00:31:43.495]  Before I do that...
[00:31:46.926 --> 00:31:48.948]  I want to plug my videos.
[00:31:49.008 --> 00:31:50.389]  They are excellent films.
[00:31:50.429 --> 00:31:51.830]  They are full-length features.
[00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:55.073]  That means over two hours long, professionally produced.
[00:31:55.153 --> 00:32:00.097]  I have now made my ninth film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:32:00.457 --> 00:32:07.763]  The greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us, a scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn to enslave every man, woman, and child.
[00:32:08.323 --> 00:32:09.064]  We're good to go.
[00:32:27.722 --> 00:32:39.146]  Takeover, the current Takeover, the true character of the globalist, learned the master plan of the bloodthirsty elite to financially, physically, and spiritually imprison not only America but the world.
[00:32:39.626 --> 00:32:45.628]  Total enslavement is the third installment in my critically acclaimed Police State series and is a must-see for all who love freedom.
[00:32:46.028 --> 00:32:49.009]  This film documents the nightmare rise of the Homeland Security dictatorship.
[00:32:49.369 --> 00:32:57.835]  Patriot Act 1 and 2, the Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison death, surveillance, economy, and much more.
[00:32:58.335 --> 00:33:07.441]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism and how the globalists pose as our saviors when, in fact, they are the terrorists.
[00:33:08.762 --> 00:33:14.786]  Of course, there's Police State 2000, the first film with the Marines trying to take your guns and put you in camps.
[00:33:16.132 --> 00:33:21.140]  The black helicopters attacking South Texas, police chiefs and mayors and city managers speaking out.
[00:33:23.138 --> 00:33:24.138]  It goes on and on.
[00:33:24.618 --> 00:33:34.101]  We have the takeover, government hired provocateurs to cause riots during protests, training the children that the schools are prisons, the FEMA camps, and much more.
[00:33:34.622 --> 00:33:37.582]  And now we have police state three total enslavement.
[00:33:37.602 --> 00:33:52.487]  They're $25.95 apiece, but if you order three or more of any of the nine films, they drop down to $20, and you're authorized and encouraged to make copies of my videos and spread the word for non-profit educational not-for-sale purposes.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.221]  So I have nine films.
[00:33:55.261 --> 00:33:59.524]  Of course, I have 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Mouses of Terror, about September 11th.
[00:33:59.564 --> 00:34:01.665]  I have my book, Ascent into Tyranny.
[00:34:02.406 --> 00:34:03.487]  It's 230 pages, only $12.
[00:34:04.768 --> 00:34:18.097]  Go to InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net or PrisonPlanet.com to order the films via our secure online shopping cart or call toll-free right now to get the videos and start Wicked America up to the reality at 1-888-

[00:34:23.081 --> 00:34:26.924]  1-888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:51.630]  All right, let's talk to Curtis in Louisiana, then Kevin in Pennsylvania, Ken in Virginia, and others.
[00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:53.131]  Curtis, you're on the air.
[00:34:53.171 --> 00:34:53.771]  Welcome, sir.
[00:34:54.851 --> 00:34:55.492]  How are you doing?
[00:34:55.712 --> 00:34:55.992]  Good.
[00:34:56.212 --> 00:34:59.273]  I wanted to let you know about a website.
[00:34:59.633 --> 00:35:14.459]  It's called truthteller.org, and what it has on it is an article about Israel, and it's basically explaining why all the terror all over the world in the Middle East is going on, and it just basically says that
[00:35:15.765 --> 00:35:21.503]  The Jews are going to be scattered and persecuted around the world if they don't turn back to God and it has...
[00:35:22.236 --> 00:35:29.721]  Different scriptures and different verses that you go to where he quotes different things out of the Bible and you can go to it and read it yourself.
[00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:31.142]  Well, let me just say this.
[00:35:31.282 --> 00:35:40.908]  I wouldn't say the Jews, but definitely the people running Israel are part of the New World Order, just like those running France or Germany or England or this country are.
[00:35:41.509 --> 00:35:42.669]  And it's not Alex Jones.
[00:35:42.729 --> 00:35:43.450]  It's Haratz.
[00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.052]  It's the Jerusalem Post.
[00:35:46.572 --> 00:35:48.113]  It's United Press International.
[00:35:48.917 --> 00:35:50.178]  It's media bypass.
[00:35:50.238 --> 00:35:51.759]  It's all in the new film, by the way.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.181]  The Police State 3.
[00:35:54.241 --> 00:35:55.702]  We have a section on Israel.
[00:35:56.843 --> 00:36:00.947]  They admit they founded and funded Hamas to create the crisis.
[00:36:01.007 --> 00:36:07.412]  Every time it looks like Sharon's going to have to sign a peace deal, bombings take place that keep this whole thing going.
[00:36:08.793 --> 00:36:10.374]  And this is the reality.
[00:36:10.394 --> 00:36:11.455]  This is the facts.
[00:36:11.495 --> 00:36:13.016]  Yishak Rabin told us about this.
[00:36:13.096 --> 00:36:15.258]  And why is it that the Bible says...
[00:36:16.337 --> 00:36:22.300]  That when Israel turns away from God and becomes secular, they go into bondage, they go into captivity, they get scattered.
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.362]  But today, the 501c3 controlled churches won't say that.
[00:36:26.962 --> 00:36:32.684]  They say that's not true when the Bible is clear on that and what you just said is absolutely on target.
[00:36:32.704 --> 00:36:37.567]  Look at all the prophets and what happened over and over again in Israel.
[00:36:38.567 --> 00:36:41.628]  And it's definitely happening again.
[00:36:41.648 --> 00:36:44.810]  And it's very, very sad.
[00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:45.190]  Go ahead.
[00:36:45.922 --> 00:36:46.503]  Exactly.
[00:36:46.583 --> 00:36:55.890]  Maybe when Colin Powell does his roadmap piece in the Middle East, maybe he needs to take these articles of the Bible and read it to them so they'll know.
[00:36:57.311 --> 00:37:01.414]  I don't know what they're doing over there, but I just wanted to let you know about that website.
[00:37:01.454 --> 00:37:02.875]  I didn't know you had that in your film.
[00:37:02.955 --> 00:37:04.196]  I plan on getting one tomorrow.
[00:37:05.017 --> 00:37:06.078]  They all sound exciting.
[00:37:06.098 --> 00:37:07.519]  I don't know which one I should get first.
[00:37:07.919 --> 00:37:10.521]  If you're getting one video, I'd get Road to Tyranny.
[00:37:10.942 --> 00:37:11.242]  Okay.
[00:37:11.742 --> 00:37:14.885]  Yeah, I'm going to get them until I get them all, but I just wanted to...
[00:37:15.697 --> 00:37:22.019]  You know, let the listeners know about that website, and they can go there and buy the videos and read the article.
[00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:22.439]  Okay.
[00:37:22.459 --> 00:37:23.059]  Yeah.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:24.740]  All right.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.580]  Well, thanks for the call.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.000]  I appreciate it, Curtis.
[00:37:27.781 --> 00:37:30.041]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Pennsylvania.
[00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:30.902]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[00:37:30.942 --> 00:37:31.262]  Welcome.
[00:37:32.442 --> 00:37:32.742]  Hello?
[00:37:33.022 --> 00:37:33.422]  Yes, sir.
[00:37:34.103 --> 00:37:38.524]  I just wanted to tell you, like, what I do, so, like, if other people are listening, they'll do the same.
[00:37:39.204 --> 00:37:44.786]  Like, I make, like, books with news stories, and I pass them all out, and I pass out your movies.
[00:37:45.626 --> 00:37:47.067]  And 9-1-1's the best one.
[00:37:47.107 --> 00:37:47.727]  That's amazing.
[00:37:49.749 --> 00:37:54.492]  We're getting 90% wake-up with Road to Tyranny with people.
[00:37:55.212 --> 00:38:04.858]  Yeah, I get a lot of people who, yeah, they wake up and stuff, but some of my friends, if they even start talking to me about it, like their girlfriends or wives, give them a look.
[00:38:05.679 --> 00:38:06.820]  They're not allowed to talk to me.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.301]  Most of my friends don't even talk to me anymore.
[00:38:09.782 --> 00:38:13.224]  But we had the primaries just a couple days ago.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.604]  And I went to, like, all the election places, and I passed out, like, books.
[00:38:16.664 --> 00:38:18.366]  I probably passed out, like, 50 movies.
[00:38:19.807 --> 00:38:21.069]  And I don't know.
[00:38:21.089 --> 00:38:22.370]  That's just what people got to do.
[00:38:23.171 --> 00:38:26.876]  But, yeah, I'm going to just start making flyers, just, like, one or two pages.
[00:38:27.492 --> 00:38:30.633]  Just make thousands and just go pass them around at the parking lots.
[00:38:30.873 --> 00:38:31.833]  Well, we've got to do it.
[00:38:31.853 --> 00:38:35.114]  Look, if we don't do it, the globalists are going to keep carrying out terror.
[00:38:35.435 --> 00:38:37.395]  They're going to accelerate this takeover.
[00:38:37.755 --> 00:38:42.077]  They're going to get away with what they're doing and keep posing as our saviors while they're the terrorists.
[00:38:42.117 --> 00:38:45.018]  We have got to do this or America is going to die.
[00:38:45.058 --> 00:38:46.018]  America is dying.
[00:38:46.398 --> 00:38:49.119]  Our sovereignty, our dollar, everything is imploding.
[00:38:49.459 --> 00:38:55.841]  Right now, by design, we have their own policy papers, their own plans that are public, and now they're doing it.
[00:38:56.431 --> 00:38:56.911]  Yeah, I know.
[00:38:57.151 --> 00:38:58.012]  It's just so hard.
[00:38:58.132 --> 00:39:06.076]  I carry around the side of an organic milk carton, and I show my friends and people what's in the milk, and they tell me I'm crazy.
[00:39:06.116 --> 00:39:07.977]  They say, who cares if you drink this stuff?
[00:39:08.677 --> 00:39:10.298]  People are just so far gone.
[00:39:10.318 --> 00:39:12.399]  I don't know.
[00:39:13.044 --> 00:39:15.466]  It seems, like, helpless sometimes, or useless.
[00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:19.468]  And you're a weirdo because you want to warn people about corruption.
[00:39:19.488 --> 00:39:20.969]  You want to be involved in your community.
[00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:24.492]  They're good because all they do is watch football and drink beer.
[00:39:24.812 --> 00:39:25.052]  Oh, yeah.
[00:39:25.092 --> 00:39:27.094]  Well, yeah, my little nephew, he's, like, 12.
[00:39:27.634 --> 00:39:28.535]  I tell him stuff.
[00:39:29.295 --> 00:39:31.857]  And, like, my whole rest of my family says, don't talk to him.
[00:39:31.917 --> 00:39:32.337]  He's nuts.
[00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:33.578]  He knows I'm right.
[00:39:33.898 --> 00:39:34.879]  Well, let me just say this.
[00:39:36.334 --> 00:39:39.535]  You know, I get some calls where 100% of people are waking up.
[00:39:39.635 --> 00:39:40.456]  Most calls, I say 90%.
[00:39:40.776 --> 00:39:44.757]  But then I get these calls where most people say, get away from me, I don't want to hear it.
[00:39:45.318 --> 00:39:47.379]  And areas like Pennsylvania do seem to be worse.
[00:39:47.419 --> 00:39:48.859]  We get a lot of that from Pennsylvania.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.180]  But a lot of times, family won't listen.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.121]  They don't respect you.
[00:39:53.161 --> 00:39:54.321]  They don't respect themselves.
[00:39:54.862 --> 00:39:58.303]  They think that when you're warning them, you're trying to talk down to them.
[00:39:58.343 --> 00:40:02.105]  You ever heard that a prophet isn't recognized in his own country?
[00:40:02.205 --> 00:40:03.125]  I hear that all the time.
[00:40:03.405 --> 00:40:06.626]  Yeah, what, I mean, are you getting any good responses from people?
[00:40:06.846 --> 00:40:09.066]  Oh, yeah, I get some.
[00:40:09.486 --> 00:40:13.027]  I had some old guy I worked with the other day.
[00:40:13.227 --> 00:40:13.787]  Oh, he's not old.
[00:40:13.807 --> 00:40:15.508]  He's like 40-something.
[00:40:16.008 --> 00:40:18.148]  He was like almost crying to me the other day.
[00:40:18.168 --> 00:40:20.109]  He's like, when do you think all this is going to happen?
[00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:26.690]  And, you know, I almost think it's a joke because I've been telling people for like seven, eight years what's going to be happening.
[00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:29.811]  And, you know, now it's really here.
[00:40:31.107 --> 00:40:35.188]  A lot of them heard it but made a split-second decision because they're afraid of the system.
[00:40:35.208 --> 00:40:39.710]  It's just to deny it exists, to hope it goes away, to bury it psychologically.
[00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:44.351]  But as things get worse, they're going to remember what you said and the seeds you planted.
[00:40:44.691 --> 00:40:47.312]  Not every seed sprouts the first year.
[00:40:47.332 --> 00:40:48.733]  They sit there dormant.
[00:40:49.373 --> 00:40:50.373]  I email stories.
[00:40:50.413 --> 00:40:56.495]  Like when people send me them stupid emails with, like, you know, it's forwarded a thousand times, I still all them emails.
[00:40:56.655 --> 00:40:59.416]  I email, like, Post Gazette and Trib stories.
[00:41:00.336 --> 00:41:02.898]  And there's links with your movie on there.
[00:41:02.958 --> 00:41:04.298]  I emailed that to people.
[00:41:04.599 --> 00:41:08.881]  I probably emailed like a thousand, and I probably got back like 20 responses.
[00:41:09.321 --> 00:41:17.186]  I got like five thank yous, and most people tell me I'm crazy or where did you get my email from, and I just keep emailing them back.
[00:41:18.687 --> 00:41:19.167]  All right, sir.
[00:41:19.227 --> 00:41:20.328]  I appreciate the call.
[00:41:20.528 --> 00:41:23.710]  Yeah, he's one of those weirdos that thinks the world is round.
[00:41:24.835 --> 00:41:27.756]  And they all say it's flat, but one day they're going to admit it's round.
[00:41:27.796 --> 00:41:31.876]  It was 3%, 2% at the start of the revolution, 5% that won it.
[00:41:31.916 --> 00:41:33.477]  We're not revolutionaries this time.
[00:41:33.817 --> 00:41:35.017]  We're restorationists.
[00:41:35.417 --> 00:41:36.817]  We want our country back.
[00:41:36.857 --> 00:41:38.458]  We're going to get our country back.
[00:41:39.978 --> 00:41:43.239]  But I've got to tell you, I've done over 800 radio interviews.
[00:41:44.659 --> 00:41:49.840]  This morning I was on Man Cal, the number one talk show in the morning in Chicago.
[00:41:52.046 --> 00:42:05.471]  And I'm on his show, and he said, Alex, I've got to tell you, you were on this show a year ago, and you said that you had video Marines training with role players screaming, I'm an American, please know, not the camp.
[00:42:05.491 --> 00:42:20.537]  And he said, I want to tell you, in Operation Top Off 2 they just did in Chicago, they had police with role players simulating hitting Americans in the face with rifle butts as they beg, I'm an American, please know, not the camp.
[00:42:21.827 --> 00:42:25.668]  And he just came right out and said, I've got to agree with you about the government carrying out the attacks.
[00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:28.690]  He said, I've got to agree with you about the police state.
[00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:41.754]  He says, I'm at the airport flying around the country, and I see 10-year-old girls being harassed by illegal aliens who are the security people, confiscating their Hello Kitty toothbrushes.
[00:42:42.175 --> 00:42:45.036]  Meanwhile, people with giant turbans walk right through.
[00:42:45.976 --> 00:42:48.537]  It's all about training you to live in a police state.
[00:42:49.048 --> 00:42:58.313]  And then as the alerts expand, the troops are on the bridges, they're on the buses, they're on the streets, the helicopters are in the air, the drones are in the air, more and more and more.
[00:43:00.334 --> 00:43:09.379]  But here I am, you know, on this show, Man Cal, number one show in Chicago, and here is his three co-hosts, you know, his sidekicks, all agreeing with me.
[00:43:10.879 --> 00:43:15.442]  Here I am doing these interviews on Pacifica, Liberal Radio, Conservative Radio.
[00:43:16.142 --> 00:43:17.203]  I've done it all, folks.
[00:43:17.383 --> 00:43:20.284]  And one out of 30 callers might call and disagree.
[00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:21.285]  But I'm bold.
[00:43:21.385 --> 00:43:22.245]  I've got my facts.
[00:43:22.345 --> 00:43:23.646]  I'm not apologetic about it.
[00:43:24.206 --> 00:43:27.909]  Five, six years ago, I'd be, I know this sounds crazy, but there's a world government.
[00:43:28.489 --> 00:43:31.471]  You don't start, you say, hey, I've got a warning for you.
[00:43:31.751 --> 00:43:32.591]  You know about history.
[00:43:32.611 --> 00:43:34.252]  You know about all the tyrants in history, right?
[00:43:34.672 --> 00:43:35.773]  Well, it's repeating itself.
[00:43:36.627 --> 00:43:37.768]  Government wants more power.
[00:43:37.808 --> 00:43:39.150]  You know that's historical, right?
[00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:39.810]  Yes, I do.
[00:43:40.331 --> 00:43:41.612]  Well, let me tell you about this.
[00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:42.893]  Please watch this.
[00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:43.514]  It's important.
[00:43:43.534 --> 00:43:44.855]  They're going to take your pension fund.
[00:43:45.296 --> 00:43:47.338]  They're going to drive down the stock market.
[00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:48.539]  They're going to devalue the dollar.
[00:43:48.579 --> 00:43:49.319]  Here's their plan.
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.741]  Here's a film about it.
[00:43:52.242 --> 00:43:57.988]  And if you're in command, if you're serious, if you're focused, they will listen.
[00:43:59.528 --> 00:44:00.949]  Don't waste your time with your family.
[00:44:00.989 --> 00:44:01.930]  They generally won't listen.
[00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:02.730]  They don't respect you.
[00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.731]  Move out.
[00:44:03.831 --> 00:44:04.871]  Find those that do care.
[00:44:04.891 --> 00:44:13.637]  Get involved in organizations, pro-rights organizations, pro-gun groups, pro-land groups, sovereignty groups, anti-illegal immigration groups.
[00:44:13.677 --> 00:44:14.437]  Go into those groups.
[00:44:14.577 --> 00:44:15.678]  Educate those activists.
[00:44:16.098 --> 00:44:17.219]  That's what you need to target.
[00:44:17.779 --> 00:44:19.120]  Let's talk to Ken in Virginia.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:19.940]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:20.401]  Go ahead.
[00:44:23.002 --> 00:44:23.623]  Go ahead, Ken.
[00:44:23.643 --> 00:44:24.163]  You're on the air.
[00:44:25.466 --> 00:44:26.006]  Good morning.
[00:44:26.046 --> 00:44:42.650]  C-SPAN had about a half hour this morning interviews with Tom Kane, chairman of the National Commission to Investigate Terrorism, and also Lee Hamilton, the Democrat, who's vice chairman.
[00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:50.992]  And I was pleasantly surprised by the skepticism and some of the questions that were asked of these people.
[00:44:51.693 --> 00:44:53.033]  Tom Kane said that...
[00:44:53.894 --> 00:45:01.717]  Well, he's aware of at least 500 questions that have been asked, and he says we are hoping to answer every one of them.
[00:45:02.378 --> 00:45:12.542]  Of course, Lee Hamilton said that we've had great cooperation from the executive branch, which we know is not true.
[00:45:12.622 --> 00:45:16.363]  Of course, sir, you're talking about the 911 Whitewash 3 that's going on.
[00:45:16.423 --> 00:45:18.304]  Now Bush has said no investigation.
[00:45:18.684 --> 00:45:21.325]  Even public hearings are now going to be secret.
[00:45:21.946 --> 00:45:22.926]  And, yeah, but you...
[00:45:23.646 --> 00:45:28.588]  Look, they know we're mad about total information awareness, so they changed the name and said they're not going to spy on us.
[00:45:28.888 --> 00:45:32.129]  They know we're mad about the TIPS program, so they changed the name, doubled the funding.
[00:45:32.509 --> 00:45:34.149]  Of course they're trying to placate you.
[00:45:34.189 --> 00:45:35.390]  They weren't a few months ago.
[00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:39.191]  That shows they know that we know, but here's the problem.
[00:45:39.471 --> 00:45:43.432]  They're allowing us to complain, allowing us to pass laws against the Anti-Patriot Act.
[00:45:44.859 --> 00:45:48.040]  So when they blow something else up, they can go, oh, see, we told you.
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.981]  Now shut up and don't ask questions.
[00:45:50.301 --> 00:46:10.547]  But there's going to be a minimum, at least, on C-SPAN, which, as I say, there were a number of questions that people turned to C-SPAN, and a couple of people asked about the Israelis who were seen clapping on the roof at the time of the 9-1-1, and what happened to them.
[00:46:10.607 --> 00:46:13.688]  They said, well, they would try to find out maybe
[00:46:14.318 --> 00:46:23.205]  And they said they upped the appropriation from $3 million to $14 million, which, of course, is much less than... Well, they're running out the clock.
[00:46:23.225 --> 00:46:29.170]  There's less than a year left now, and many of the people on the committees were involved in the whole fiasco.
[00:46:29.791 --> 00:46:29.991]  Yes.
[00:46:30.812 --> 00:46:35.936]  One of the callers said, I'd feel a lot better if there weren't any people in the government on it.
[00:46:35.996 --> 00:46:37.317]  So there were some...
[00:46:38.044 --> 00:46:40.605]  There were a number of skeptical questions asked.
[00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:51.289]  I've been sent tapes off C-SPAN, Washington Journal, where there will be an hour of callers where 9 out of 10 are saying the government did it.
[00:46:52.149 --> 00:46:56.771]  I have videos where they swarm them and Lamb will cut the calls off.
[00:46:57.961 --> 00:46:59.783]  Okay, they had a town hall meeting in Virginia.
[00:46:59.823 --> 00:47:01.105]  Everybody started saying the government did it.
[00:47:01.486 --> 00:47:03.348]  C-SPAN walked off the stage.
[00:47:03.708 --> 00:47:05.310]  They ended the town hall meeting.
[00:47:05.651 --> 00:47:08.214]  Yeah, they can't keep their illusion going for long.
[00:47:09.035 --> 00:47:09.235]  Right.
[00:47:09.435 --> 00:47:15.223]  When all these couch potatoes see that the cattle are going in the other direction and aren't cattle, they're going to wake up too.
[00:47:16.159 --> 00:47:18.461]  I just thought it was slightly encouraging.
[00:47:18.501 --> 00:47:20.143]  That's what I wanted to pass along.
[00:47:20.703 --> 00:47:24.727]  Let me tell you, Ken, that is very, very encouraging.
[00:47:25.488 --> 00:47:30.332]  What were the politicians' faces like as the people called in saying they weren't buying what was happening?
[00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:34.291]  Well, frankly, I was moving around.
[00:47:34.311 --> 00:47:45.977]  I wasn't watching their expressions, but, of course, Tom Kane always looked very affable, and he said, well, I'm not part of this.
[00:47:46.057 --> 00:47:49.499]  I was the governor of New Jersey, and I wasn't.
[00:47:51.632 --> 00:47:55.355]  Let me add a caveat to this.
[00:47:56.375 --> 00:48:04.541]  Sure, and in the executive branch of Stonewall, there's Minoka compliance, and that shows that's a lie.
[00:48:05.061 --> 00:48:05.822]  But here's the deal.
[00:48:05.862 --> 00:48:09.404]  People should ask, why was Bush on the anthrax-fighting antibiotic before 9-1-1?
[00:48:09.844 --> 00:48:12.506]  They should ask, why was Mayor Willie Brown told not to fly?
[00:48:12.746 --> 00:48:14.027]  Why were the hijackers trained at U.S.
[00:48:14.087 --> 00:48:14.387]  bases?
[00:48:14.447 --> 00:48:15.848]  Why are a bunch of them still alive?
[00:48:16.128 --> 00:48:17.449]  Why did the government found al-Qaeda?
[00:48:17.469 --> 00:48:19.411]  Why did the government use al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs in 1998?
[00:48:20.912 --> 00:48:21.873]  These are the questions.
[00:48:21.933 --> 00:48:22.893]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[00:48:23.594 --> 00:48:26.056]  Mike in Illinois, Mike in Rhode Island, and others, you're up next.

[00:49:09.135 --> 00:49:09.335]  I think?

[00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:09.374]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:51:36.295 --> 00:51:41.638]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:45.079 --> 00:51:48.301]  All right, folks, let's go straight back into your calls, and we've got a guest joining us.
[00:51:48.841 --> 00:51:50.562]  Mike in Rhode Island, you're on the air.
[00:51:50.642 --> 00:51:51.202]  Welcome, sir.
[00:51:51.222 --> 00:51:52.523]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[00:51:52.783 --> 00:51:53.223]  Fine, sir.
[00:51:53.863 --> 00:51:58.305]  Yeah, it seems an awful coincidence that Lord Bush's, all those people are quitting or resigning.
[00:51:58.585 --> 00:51:59.766]  What do you think might be going on there?
[00:52:01.252 --> 00:52:06.795]  Well, they do that generally right before an election so they don't have to answer questions of the media.
[00:52:07.335 --> 00:52:11.997]  Also, they go and cash in on book deals and TV deals, and I think that's a large part of it.
[00:52:12.017 --> 00:52:16.439]  I mean, we've got the press secretary resigning a couple days ago, but what else are you talking about?
[00:52:16.459 --> 00:52:17.340]  Who else is resigning?
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.001]  Christine Whitman.
[00:52:20.601 --> 00:52:21.122]  Ah, yes.
[00:52:21.162 --> 00:52:23.683]  Yes, she just resigned yesterday, I believe.
[00:52:24.923 --> 00:52:30.146]  And I don't know, maybe these people are developing a conscience possibly and seeing things going on, and maybe...
[00:52:30.851 --> 00:52:31.832]  You know, bothering them, maybe?
[00:52:32.792 --> 00:52:33.273]  You never know.
[00:52:33.973 --> 00:52:44.421]  Well, we know the head of FEMA quit, too, but he went off to help run the private merger of the government with corporations, so a lot of them are being sent to other strategic locations.
[00:52:45.182 --> 00:52:48.224]  Oh, yeah, it's just totally crazy what's going on.
[00:52:48.804 --> 00:52:49.445]  All the bombings.
[00:52:49.745 --> 00:52:57.411]  I mean, I remember when you had Craig Roberts on your show, Colonel Craig Roberts, probably about a year ago, and he was saying that we are going into the period of escalating violence now.
[00:52:58.157 --> 00:52:59.097]  Boy, was he ready on the money.
[00:52:59.638 --> 00:53:04.560]  Yeah, he said lots of bombings in Saudi Arabia and around the Middle East escalate all this, yes.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.241]  Yes, they continue to take our rights away daily.
[00:53:07.661 --> 00:53:10.282]  And I just have a little thing I'd like to discuss.
[00:53:10.602 --> 00:53:12.923]  I was talking to a former Marine yesterday.
[00:53:13.963 --> 00:53:15.464]  He's probably around 25 years old.
[00:53:15.664 --> 00:53:17.044]  And I was trying to talk to him about this stuff.
[00:53:17.104 --> 00:53:18.345]  And I basically asked him point blank.
[00:53:18.365 --> 00:53:20.546]  I said, would you fire on an American citizen?
[00:53:21.566 --> 00:53:22.667]  And he said, if I was ordered to.
[00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:25.855]  So he hasn't read his handbook.
[00:53:25.875 --> 00:53:27.016]  He's not supposed to do that.
[00:53:27.076 --> 00:53:28.817]  It's totally illegal and totally criminal.
[00:53:28.957 --> 00:53:31.658]  Yeah, I tried telling him that, and I was explaining it to him.
[00:53:31.698 --> 00:53:32.439]  I gave him a few things.
[00:53:32.499 --> 00:53:34.440]  I told him, go to your website, check this stuff out.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.581]  I said, don't believe what I say.
[00:53:36.221 --> 00:53:38.382]  Go do the investigation like I did.
[00:53:39.163 --> 00:53:39.843]  Absolutely.
[00:53:41.024 --> 00:53:42.525]  Well, he said he was open to it.
[00:53:43.205 --> 00:53:47.688]  He did say, though, he believes there are definitely bombs in the towers at World Trade Center.
[00:53:47.808 --> 00:53:50.269]  But he's going to shoot Americans if the government says so.
[00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:51.450]  Yep, I can't understand that.
[00:53:53.115 --> 00:53:54.616]  Well, we know there were bombs in Building 7.
[00:53:54.676 --> 00:53:55.697]  That's just a fact.
[00:53:55.717 --> 00:53:58.579]  The building fell faster than it could from a normal implosion.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:00.781]  Appreciate the call, Mike.
[00:54:00.821 --> 00:54:01.401]  Good to hear from you.
[00:54:01.841 --> 00:54:02.342]  Thank you.
[00:54:02.922 --> 00:54:04.103]  Appreciate it.
[00:54:04.283 --> 00:54:05.944]  Mike in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:54:05.984 --> 00:54:06.585]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:54:06.785 --> 00:54:07.606]  Alex, how you doing?
[00:54:07.766 --> 00:54:08.226]  Fantastic.
[00:54:08.306 --> 00:54:11.909]  I am so very disappointed that I did not know you were going to be on Man Cow.
[00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:13.850]  I do not normally listen to his show.
[00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:17.573]  He's an all right guy, but I don't listen to his show.
[00:54:17.653 --> 00:54:19.434]  Had I known you were going to be on it, I wouldn't listen.
[00:54:19.474 --> 00:54:20.415]  How long were you on there?
[00:54:21.047 --> 00:54:22.768]  Oh, I've been on it an hour and 20 minutes before.
[00:54:22.788 --> 00:54:24.648]  I was only on about 20 minutes this morning.
[00:54:24.708 --> 00:54:25.469]  Oh, my God.
[00:54:25.489 --> 00:54:27.970]  Well, that's great exposure for you, Alex.
[00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:29.090]  Great exposure for you.
[00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:31.231]  That's a very well-listened-to show.
[00:54:31.251 --> 00:54:32.691]  Well, it's not exposure for me.
[00:54:32.771 --> 00:54:38.934]  I mean, Mancow heard me say the Marines were training with role players going, I'm an American, not the camp, and now he sees it in Chicago.
[00:54:39.274 --> 00:54:39.474]  Right.
[00:54:39.914 --> 00:54:40.254]  Absolutely.
[00:54:40.894 --> 00:54:43.435]  By the way, people were going to go get video of that.
[00:54:43.495 --> 00:54:44.476]  You were in Chicago.
[00:54:44.756 --> 00:54:46.336]  Alex, I told you I'd get you video.
[00:54:46.396 --> 00:54:48.077]  Let me explain something to you that happened to me.
[00:54:48.177 --> 00:54:48.697]  I went there.
[00:54:48.737 --> 00:54:50.398]  I actually took work off early that day.
[00:54:51.041 --> 00:54:51.582]  We're good to go.
[00:55:07.705 --> 00:55:08.305]  I couldn't get in there.
[00:55:08.325 --> 00:55:09.646]  They had it all corned off with police.
[00:55:09.686 --> 00:55:11.367]  You couldn't get around there.
[00:55:11.407 --> 00:55:16.289]  I videotaped the police, and I will send you that tape, but it says, you know, you can't go there.
[00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:17.029]  We've got to shut down.
[00:55:17.049 --> 00:55:20.130]  There's an exercise going on right now.
[00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:21.931]  We could not get in the area to do it.
[00:55:21.971 --> 00:55:26.393]  And inside they were training for forced injections and concentration camp shipping.
[00:55:27.013 --> 00:55:28.074]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:55:28.214 --> 00:55:29.215]  I'm telling you, it's mind-boggling.
[00:55:29.235 --> 00:55:31.857]  Oh, I mean, the big morning show in Chicago just said it.
[00:55:32.277 --> 00:55:34.378]  You know, that's his wake-up call, too.
[00:55:34.398 --> 00:55:36.740]  He was like, yeah, a year ago I didn't quite buy what you were saying.
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:37.480]  Now I do.
[00:55:38.241 --> 00:55:44.885]  Alex, I'll tell you, I call a lot of large talk radio shows in Chicago, and I've tried to tell them about you.
[00:55:45.045 --> 00:55:52.971]  I even gave your website out on the radio, and then they disconnected me because I'm trying to expose the truth to people.
[00:55:53.771 --> 00:55:55.372]  And they're waking up, Alex.
[00:55:55.392 --> 00:55:56.393]  There's so much stuff going on.
[00:55:57.094 --> 00:55:59.275]  Alex, can I ask you a real quick question before the break there?
[00:55:59.335 --> 00:55:59.635]  Sure.
[00:56:00.636 --> 00:56:07.379]  Someone told me that the 9-11 attack, that there are 7,000 Jews that are employed in the World Trade Center.
[00:56:07.399 --> 00:56:09.160]  They were not employed at work that day.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.360]  Did you ever hear anything about that?
[00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:11.281]  That is true.
[00:56:11.361 --> 00:56:14.842]  MSNBC checked into it and said the urban legend was true.
[00:56:15.263 --> 00:56:18.864]  Also, the Jewish newspapers have reported they were told not to go to work.
[00:56:18.884 --> 00:56:20.005]  That is a confirmed fact.
[00:56:21.653 --> 00:56:22.394]  Are you prepared?
[00:56:22.594 --> 00:56:24.977]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[00:56:25.197 --> 00:56:29.622]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[00:56:29.923 --> 00:56:38.753]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.383 --> 00:56:47.023]  Big Brother.
[00:56:47.684 --> 00:56:48.744]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:49.444 --> 00:56:50.585]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:50.605 --> 00:56:52.045]  You want answers?
[00:56:52.786 --> 00:56:53.706]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.346 --> 00:56:57.988]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.528 --> 00:57:02.669]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.911 --> 00:57:07.431]  All right, there's been a lot of bombings.
[00:57:07.471 --> 00:57:10.933]  We're going to talk about the economy, the globalists, what they're all about.
[00:57:10.953 --> 00:57:13.954]  There was a story yesterday...
[00:57:15.282 --> 00:57:16.063]  We're good to go.
[00:57:16.083 --> 00:57:17.083]  We're good to go.
[00:57:17.143 --> 00:57:18.284]  We're good to go.
[00:57:46.542 --> 00:57:55.196]  Well, it does exist, and now it's public, thanks to the work of folks out there, like Tony Gosling of Bilderberg.org, who's about to join us.
[00:57:56.277 --> 00:58:01.125]  The Asia Times reported the Masters of the Universe, and this is the headline.
[00:58:02.037 --> 00:58:06.160]  Middle East, The Roving Eye, The Masters of the Universe is the headline.
[00:58:06.801 --> 00:58:08.502]  It may be instructive to learn what U.S.
[00:58:08.522 --> 00:58:14.847]  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the Prince of Darkness Richard Perle were doing last weekend from May 15th to 18th.
[00:58:14.887 --> 00:58:23.093]  They were guests at the Palace Hotel close to the spectacular Versailles Palace near Paris for the annual meeting of the Bilderberg Club.
[00:58:24.193 --> 00:58:46.223]  And so depending on the ideological prism applied, the Bilderberg Club may be considered an ultra-VIP international lobby of the power elite of Europe and America capable of steering international policy from behind closed doors or a harmless discussion group of politicians, academics, and business tycoons or a capitalist secret society operating entirely through self-interest and plotting world domination.
[00:58:46.263 --> 00:58:49.365]  Well, we get the minutes out of it each year from spies inside.
[00:58:51.269 --> 00:58:51.769]  And we know.
[00:58:51.809 --> 00:58:53.050]  They're calling for world government.
[00:58:53.090 --> 00:58:55.110]  They basically decide who our presidents will be.
[00:58:55.230 --> 00:59:02.233]  Every year before an election, the two candidates will go before Bilderberg Group, and they'll be selected who will be president next.
[00:59:02.273 --> 00:59:03.253]  This is part of the record.
[00:59:04.714 --> 00:59:06.874]  And they're not even what you'd call capitalists.
[00:59:06.894 --> 00:59:07.935]  They're crony capitalists.
[00:59:07.955 --> 00:59:11.176]  They control fascism, communism, any way to consolidate power.
[00:59:12.096 --> 00:59:14.757]  And now joining us is Tony Gosling.
[00:59:15.823 --> 00:59:19.365]  And he was born in 1962 and brought up in Bromley, South London.
[00:59:19.425 --> 00:59:29.290]  He ended his formal education at Inkley College in West Yorkshire with a humanities degree specializing in English literature from Bradford University.
[00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:39.476]  After working for a few years in the family aviations part business, he decided to have a go at radio journalism, volunteering for GLC-funded radio programs.
[00:59:40.494 --> 01:00:02.879]  And it says in southeast London, and then he did a long bio, and a lot of radio, a lot of newspaper stuff, and has done a lot of great work, and has a gigantic encyclopedic website, Bilderberg.org, and joining us, one of the premier folks out there exposing these critters, is Tony Gosling, joining us from the United Kingdom.
[01:00:03.219 --> 01:00:04.599]  Tony, good to have you on the show today.
[01:00:05.479 --> 01:00:06.140]  Oh yeah, hi Alex.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.020]  I appreciate you coming on the broadcast.
[01:00:09.279 --> 01:00:09.760]  No problem.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.963]  Yeah, I just got back a few days ago from Versailles.
[01:00:13.965 --> 01:00:16.928]  As always, the Bilderbergs meet in very posh locations.
[01:00:17.889 --> 01:00:22.494]  But, I mean, I think a lot of the stuff you're talking about is exactly about what's on their agenda and what power they have.
[01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:25.723]  Some of it is speculation and some of it is fact.
[01:00:25.943 --> 01:00:37.291]  And one of the things I try and do with my website, builderberg.org, is to separate the speculation from the fact and actually pin down what we really do know about this group.
[01:00:37.532 --> 01:00:40.394]  One thing most certainly is that they have a lot of power.
[01:00:41.595 --> 01:00:46.782]  They successfully managed to close down entirely the mainstream French press.
[01:00:46.822 --> 01:00:51.768]  It was only the indie media website in Paris that really had anything about this conference at all.
[01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:56.575]  Even though you've got kings and queens and some of the most powerful people on earth, there was almost no coverage whatsoever.
[01:00:58.268 --> 01:00:59.610]  Well, news for me is it definitely does exist.
[01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.650]  I...
[01:01:12.065 --> 01:01:14.106]  Was quite surprised.
[01:01:14.186 --> 01:01:17.348]  And there's always a few surprises if you turn up to try and cover a Bilderberg conference.
[01:01:17.388 --> 01:01:21.570]  There were about, I suppose, between five and ten independent journalists down there.
[01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:22.791]  I want to hear about that.
[01:01:22.831 --> 01:01:24.252]  I want to hear about what happened.
[01:01:24.272 --> 01:01:25.753]  I want to talk about your website.
[01:01:25.853 --> 01:01:27.634]  I want to talk about the history of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:01:28.014 --> 01:01:28.994]  And I want to take calls.
[01:01:29.054 --> 01:01:36.258]  One of the premier experts on the Bilderberg Group, and hence the New World Order, Tony Gosling, our guest for this hour, joining us from Britain.
[01:01:36.939 --> 01:01:37.939]  You're welcome to join us at 800-259-9231.
[01:01:37.999 --> 01:01:38.640]  Tony, stay right there.
[01:01:44.016 --> 01:01:48.518]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:01:48.858 --> 01:01:52.960]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:01:53.241 --> 01:01:53.801]  We listened.
[01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:59.084]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:01:59.364 --> 01:01:59.844]  We listened.
[01:02:00.224 --> 01:02:03.266]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:04.226]  We listened.
[01:02:04.686 --> 01:02:08.128]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:02:08.148 --> 01:02:08.648]  We're good to go.
[01:02:34.595 --> 01:02:37.918]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:02:39.079 --> 01:02:40.500]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:02:43.243 --> 01:02:50.649]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:50.909 --> 01:02:55.653]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.853 --> 01:03:01.518]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.738 --> 01:03:02.458]  We're good to go.
[01:03:18.366 --> 01:03:20.887]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:03:21.087 --> 01:03:27.849]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.821]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:03:44.001 --> 01:03:49.645]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:03:49.965 --> 01:03:50.826]  Probably never, right?
[01:03:51.106 --> 01:03:54.168]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.
[01:03:54.428 --> 01:03:56.869]  He's the owner and founder of the Cal Bend Soap Company.

[01:04:46.305 --> 01:04:49.168]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:53.491 --> 01:04:54.853]  From Washington, D.C.
[01:04:54.873 --> 01:04:59.757]  to Rochester, New York, to Pensacola, Florida, to Austin, Texas, to Albuquerque, New Mexico...
[01:05:01.696 --> 01:05:05.537]  Through the big redwoods of Northern California, we're on the AM and FM dial.
[01:05:05.577 --> 01:05:07.118]  The show is exploding and growing.
[01:05:07.138 --> 01:05:09.798]  We talk about the facts, the reality of the criminal elite.
[01:05:10.378 --> 01:05:17.821]  We simulcast on Global Shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 Central at 12.172 and 93.20, and from 9 to midnight Central at 5.085 and 68.90, and of course at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:05:27.071 --> 01:05:33.472]  Tomorrow we have Big Jim Tucker from American Free Press who's been covering the Bilderberg Group for over 25 years joining us.
[01:05:33.512 --> 01:05:37.873]  He just got back from Versailles where the power elite were meeting, carving up the world.
[01:05:38.853 --> 01:05:46.935]  And we're joined by one of the other premier researchers, long-term researchers, Tony Gosling, who just got back from France.
[01:05:48.095 --> 01:05:51.416]  And he has worked as a documentary maker.
[01:05:51.496 --> 01:05:52.796]  He has worked for BBC.
[01:05:54.214 --> 01:06:02.317]  He is currently the Bristol Branch Secretary of the National Union of Journalists in England, and he just got back.
[01:06:02.978 --> 01:06:16.643]  There was absolutely no news in France about this, other than the indie media sites, and he said there was just under ten independent journalists that were there covering it, sort of talk about the Bilderberg Group, the history of it, his adventures, what happened this year.
[01:06:17.752 --> 01:06:25.199]  And what they may have gotten out from the people inside the hotel, which they normally do, were joined by Tony Gosling from the United Kingdom.
[01:06:25.259 --> 01:06:26.580]  Again, Tony, thanks for coming on.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.441]  No problem.
[01:06:27.841 --> 01:06:38.851]  I really have to hand it to Jim, I have to say, because there's no way that we would be able to cover this conference, really, without Jim's work, because he's one of the only people on Earth that manages to winkle out where these guys are going to be meeting.
[01:06:39.792 --> 01:06:41.814]  And so, full respect to Jim Tucker.
[01:06:43.127 --> 01:06:43.728]  Absolutely.
[01:06:44.388 --> 01:06:47.912]  And he was covering it when nobody had heard of it 20-something years ago.
[01:06:47.932 --> 01:07:01.626]  I'm surprised there's not more interest in Europe as well about the Bilderberg Group because it clearly has an important role in pushing forward the latest European policies, pan-European policies.
[01:07:01.646 --> 01:07:05.830]  And of course they're now starting to talk about in Europe about the United States of Europe.
[01:07:06.783 --> 01:07:12.628]  For the first time, quite openly, in the Daily Telegraph on the flight on the way over to Versailles this year.
[01:07:12.708 --> 01:07:18.714]  It was an article about Tony Blair's having a few problems in creating his wonderful United States of Europe.
[01:07:18.954 --> 01:07:22.477]  And they're also taking a lot of people's liberties inside this system.
[01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:23.758]  They're getting rid of juries.
[01:07:23.818 --> 01:07:25.499]  They're getting rid of free speech.
[01:07:25.579 --> 01:07:31.585]  They're saying that people have to accept genetically modified food, destroy the food chain and local control.
[01:07:32.185 --> 01:07:33.666]  It's all about monopoly of power.
[01:07:33.686 --> 01:07:38.688]  Until about three years ago, I never saw mainstream articles about it, other than American Free Press and your website.
[01:07:39.048 --> 01:07:54.614]  And it's starting to, the mainstream, some of the mainstream, at least independent mainstream, and it was really quite a perfect example because there was nobody from the big corporate, you know, the big newspapers that are controlled by these multinational media corporations.
[01:07:54.654 --> 01:08:00.136]  Now, about three years ago, Reuters did, about three years ago, Tony, Reuters did have an article saying,
[01:08:00.774 --> 01:08:04.636]  Where it did talk about Bilderberg Group and the kings and queens and the bankers that were there.
[01:08:04.676 --> 01:08:06.856]  Did that shock you, and why do you think Reuters reported that?
[01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:15.420]  Well, often you see this stuff is put on Reuters in the knowledge that it's not going to be transmitted elsewhere, that the editors, et cetera, that received the Reuters service...
[01:08:16.724 --> 01:08:23.212]  We'll read it and they'll understand because there is only any information released to the press after the meeting's taken place.
[01:08:23.272 --> 01:08:29.599]  So, of course, there's no real opportunity for any critical comment of the people inside.
[01:08:30.781 --> 01:08:34.165]  Even though they release this document called a press release every year,
[01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:47.208]  It's surprising because, you know, as you'd expect that something on a press release would, and it usually is, designed for public consumption, after the first page of the press release it says strictly confidential.
[01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:50.769]  And then it follows a list of the participants at the meeting.
[01:08:50.849 --> 01:09:03.713]  So although they're quite happy to say after the event to the press that this has just taken place, and only to the mainstream press, by the way, I mean, I've requested a press release this year and received nothing at all from them, not even the basic text.
[01:09:05.113 --> 01:09:10.697]  So, you know, the fight goes on to find out exactly what these things are all about.
[01:09:11.157 --> 01:09:14.799]  This year, one of the big things they've been talking about is the European Army.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.421]  That definitely was on the agenda this year.
[01:09:17.481 --> 01:09:28.009]  There's attempts, of course, if you're trying to forge a political union in Europe, one of the main things is to make sure the military are all talking to each other because there's been, you know, in the past, quite a lot of disputes.
[01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:32.292]  So this is something which is definitely on the agenda at Bilderberg.
[01:09:33.806 --> 01:09:44.592]  The other thing this year we found out was that they were definitely, I mean, as you'd expect, talking about post-Iraq Middle East, although they call it the Middle East post-terrorism.
[01:09:45.032 --> 01:09:49.194]  And I wonder, is that the terrorism of the United States and Great Britain they're talking about?
[01:09:49.354 --> 01:09:52.576]  Or is it, you know, terrorists in Iraq?
[01:09:52.696 --> 01:09:56.658]  I mean, this is all confusing language, and they're starting to get to the edge of what is credible.
[01:09:57.018 --> 01:10:01.260]  Now, Tony Gosling, again, former BBC reporter, documentary maker,
[01:10:02.621 --> 01:10:08.065]  I've got a list of questions here for you.
[01:10:08.085 --> 01:10:09.786]  Go for it, yeah.
[01:10:10.106 --> 01:10:14.709]  I want to, number one, talk about the history of Bilderberg Group.
[01:10:14.729 --> 01:10:22.815]  Then I want to talk about who was attending this year, the experiences you had trying to cover it there on the ground, some of the other journalists that were there.
[01:10:22.835 --> 01:10:24.276]  I also...
[01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:26.171]  We're good to go.
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.700]  Even in the U.S.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.582]  and England, and that presidential hopefuls go and present themselves to these people.
[01:10:48.622 --> 01:10:50.202]  We have leaders of the Senate that go.
[01:10:50.742 --> 01:10:52.563]  They sign these nondisclosure agreements.
[01:10:52.603 --> 01:10:54.383]  They meet with the royalty and all these people.
[01:10:54.743 --> 01:10:58.604]  So I also want to point out that there's obvious policymaking for the United States.
[01:10:58.644 --> 01:11:00.665]  But first off, history of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:11:01.943 --> 01:11:09.408]  Well, that's lots of different questions all rolled into one.
[01:11:10.029 --> 01:11:11.249]  But first of all, the history.
[01:11:11.269 --> 01:11:12.670]  It started in 1954.
[01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:17.273]  It was begun by two characters.
[01:11:17.413 --> 01:11:18.754]  One very open.
[01:11:19.255 --> 01:11:20.896]  The other one a bit kind of in the shadows.
[01:11:20.936 --> 01:11:22.837]  The guy in the shadows was Joseph Rettinger.
[01:11:24.214 --> 01:11:31.299]  He was purported to be, at least quite possibly, was an agent of MI6.
[01:11:31.459 --> 01:11:35.582]  It came out in a book about two years ago that he had been working for MI6.
[01:11:36.062 --> 01:11:38.063]  That's the British Foreign Intelligence Service.
[01:11:39.244 --> 01:11:45.749]  And not a lot is known about him, although there is some information on my website about his involvement in starting Bilderberg.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:58.827]  But the one who's a real high-profile character is Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, and of course his daughter, Beatrix, was there, got very close to her actually this time at this latest Bilderberg meeting in Versailles.
[01:12:00.248 --> 01:12:01.349]  So Bernhard started it.
[01:12:01.369 --> 01:12:14.136]  He's an interesting character, Bernhard, because he's both before and after he started at Bilderberg had some really disastrous things happen to him which throw a lot of doubt over his integrity.
[01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:14.897]  First of all, his...
[01:12:15.772 --> 01:12:24.841]  Membership before the US entered World War II of the SS, the German SS.
[01:12:24.861 --> 01:12:31.727]  He then left Germany afterwards and married into the Dutch royal family, but he was in Hitler's feared SS during the war.
[01:12:32.027 --> 01:12:38.853]  This is the guy that started the group off, and the irony is, of course, that they will tell us that one of the reasons for the group is to stop the next...
[01:12:40.415 --> 01:12:43.596]  Or to stop any other possible Hitler surfacing in the future.
[01:12:43.996 --> 01:12:49.558]  Now, I would have thought one of the worst people to start an organisation dedicated to that task was someone who'd been in Hitler's SS.
[01:12:50.798 --> 01:12:52.538]  Anyway, that's what he did back in 1954.
[01:12:53.039 --> 01:13:04.222]  He got the first meeting together, and he was chairman of Bilderberg, and he kind of presided over the meetings up until 1975, where there was a massive scandal involving the Prince.
[01:13:04.282 --> 01:13:05.602]  He was discovered to have...
[01:13:07.575 --> 01:13:14.461]  He was discovered to have taken a million-dollar bribe from Lockheed to get the Dutch government to buy the Starfighter aircraft.
[01:13:15.301 --> 01:13:27.531]  And there was evidence that, well, first of all, he denied it, but then some evidence came to light that a piece of scribbled notepaper written by the Prince, which explained, yes, he had actually taken a million-dollar bribe, and he'd laundered it through some charity that he was involved with,
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:32.381]  And so this completely discredited the prince for good, really, in Holland.
[01:13:32.421 --> 01:13:35.021]  But he's still not taken all that seriously.
[01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:40.703]  We also have Kirk Voltheim, the Nazi, running the UN from 72 to 82 as their Secretary General.
[01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:45.684]  So we see this system being peopled by basically crump agents.
[01:13:46.204 --> 01:13:51.085]  And we also have the prince, who would be the king, in Germany during the war.
[01:13:52.824 --> 01:14:03.471]  Well, the King and Queen of Spain were at this latest Bilderberg meeting.
[01:14:04.652 --> 01:14:05.933]  I don't know, I haven't seen the list.
[01:14:05.993 --> 01:14:07.053]  I hope they're both on the list.
[01:14:07.153 --> 01:14:08.334]  Juan Carlos.
[01:14:08.374 --> 01:14:12.277]  Have you seen the list this year, Alex?
[01:14:13.463 --> 01:14:15.184]  No, but... Has anyone managed to get you a copy?
[01:14:15.204 --> 01:14:16.505]  I think as many people as possible.
[01:14:16.525 --> 01:14:19.526]  It would be really good to phone up the Bilderberg office.
[01:14:19.606 --> 01:14:21.067]  Their phone number is on my website.
[01:14:21.107 --> 01:14:25.248]  And maybe leave a message saying, please could we have a list of people who attended?
[01:14:25.689 --> 01:14:28.590]  Because this is the first year so far that they've refused to send me the list.
[01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:30.571]  Normally I publish the list after the meeting.
[01:14:31.011 --> 01:14:37.038]  I mean, one would have thought that there's no reason, the security, there's no security reason why they can't now send me a list of people who were there.
[01:14:37.258 --> 01:14:39.440]  But you were there.
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:43.645]  Sir, you were there this year, and we're going to talk about that and how you got close to Queen Beatrix.
[01:14:44.997 --> 01:14:47.978]  The thing I wanted to cover here was this Asia Times article.
[01:14:48.438 --> 01:14:59.980]  Pepe Escobar wrote an article about Masters of the Universe, about the Prince of Darkness, as they call him, Richard Pearl and Donald Rumsfeld, there at the meeting as well.
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.820]  These are current members of the administration.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:02.700]  Can you confirm that?
[01:15:03.161 --> 01:15:04.821]  Well, certainly I can confirm Richard Pearl.
[01:15:04.841 --> 01:15:07.721]  I definitely saw him, and I'll put a picture of him up on my webpages.
[01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:10.582]  But Rumsfeld, I'm not sure about, I'm afraid.
[01:15:11.416 --> 01:15:21.148]  I mean, the list of people who attend is kind of a flaky affair because you're never quite sure if the people who have turned up
[01:15:22.004 --> 01:15:25.186]  Are going to be on the list, especially if they're only there for one afternoon or something.
[01:15:25.226 --> 01:15:30.249]  For example, there were very strong rumours that Chirac was turning up.
[01:15:30.309 --> 01:15:38.434]  In fact, a helicopter, especially quiet helicopter, appeared early on Saturday morning and then disappeared later on in the day from the area of the hotel.
[01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:46.879]  So we were very... There seemed to be some evidence, and also from staff inside the hotel, telling us that Chirac was due.
[01:15:48.459 --> 01:15:53.261]  So, yes, there's all sorts of people that maybe are there and maybe aren't.
[01:15:53.281 --> 01:15:54.181]  So we have to kind of guess.
[01:15:54.241 --> 01:15:56.342]  When we get the list, at least there's a chance something to go on.
[01:15:56.382 --> 01:15:57.682]  But at the moment, we've got no list at all.
[01:15:58.002 --> 01:16:03.564]  Now, we're talking to Tony Gosling, Bilderberg.org, premier website exposing this.
[01:16:03.604 --> 01:16:05.044]  We've got Jim Tucker coming on tomorrow.
[01:16:07.105 --> 01:16:09.545]  We'll talk about some of your other experiences while you were there.
[01:16:09.605 --> 01:16:11.626]  But a question I have when we get back, Jim Tucker...
[01:16:12.387 --> 01:16:17.949]  Last year at the last meeting said, no, the invasion is not in 2002, like the media is saying is for sure.
[01:16:18.409 --> 01:16:20.190]  It's going to be in February or March.
[01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:22.431]  And then that, of course, happened.
[01:16:22.471 --> 01:16:26.892]  He said he saw Arab leaders there, which he never sees, showing this.
[01:16:26.932 --> 01:16:36.916]  So we'll talk about that and how Jim Tucker, and you use the same tactics, talks to people around the hotel before, gets the staff to leak key information after they see how evil these people are.
[01:16:37.456 --> 01:16:41.057]  We'll talk about it on the other side when we get back with our guests covering Bilderberg Group.
[01:16:44.119 --> 01:16:48.621]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:16:48.981 --> 01:16:53.062]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:53.362 --> 01:16:53.903]  We listened.
[01:16:54.203 --> 01:16:59.185]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:59.465 --> 01:16:59.965]  We listened.
[01:17:00.345 --> 01:17:03.366]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.806 --> 01:17:04.347]  We listened.
[01:17:04.807 --> 01:17:08.148]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:17:08.188 --> 01:17:12.490]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium.
[01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:35.470]  We're good to go.
[01:17:57.366 --> 01:17:57.606]  The book,
[01:18:24.588 --> 01:18:29.251]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[01:18:29.491 --> 01:18:33.414]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[01:18:33.534 --> 01:18:34.794]  Call the Ark Institute today.
[01:18:34.934 --> 01:18:37.156]  Toll free 1-800-255-1912.
[01:18:37.736 --> 01:18:42.379]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com.
[01:18:42.799 --> 01:18:47.082]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:51.965]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:18:52.425 --> 01:18:52.846]  We're good to go.
[01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:07.562]  We're good to go.
[01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:35.690]  Don't wait.
[01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:36.631]  Do it today.
[01:19:36.951 --> 01:19:37.392]  The number 800-686-2237
[01:19:42.575 --> 01:19:46.157]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:19:46.398 --> 01:19:47.818]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:19:48.299 --> 01:19:49.740]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:55.183]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:19:55.543 --> 01:20:00.026]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:20:00.346 --> 01:20:08.992]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:20:09.492 --> 01:20:10.612]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:20:11.092 --> 01:20:14.853]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:20:15.133 --> 01:20:21.755]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:20:22.095 --> 01:20:26.136]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[01:20:29.937 --> 01:20:31.397]  Or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[01:20:45.406 --> 01:20:51.451]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:20:52.051 --> 01:20:55.034]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:57.816 --> 01:21:05.581]  We're talking to veteran journalist, documentary maker, BBC reporter, Tony Gosling from the United Kingdom.
[01:21:05.621 --> 01:21:05.942]  He now...
[01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:10.714]  Is the Bristol branch secretary of the National Union of Journalists.
[01:21:10.734 --> 01:21:11.435]  There's a lot of work.
[01:21:11.475 --> 01:21:13.157]  Bilderberg.org is the website.
[01:21:13.177 --> 01:21:15.159]  You can link through at Infowars.com if you'd like.
[01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:17.070]  Tony, you've got the floor.
[01:21:17.091 --> 01:21:19.812]  I mean, you're the expert in the Bilderberg Group more than I am.
[01:21:19.912 --> 01:21:31.457]  I just hear the stories from Jim and read his articles that later turn out to be very accurate, how he'll go to the hotel days before, check in before they kick him out, tell the employees, give me information on these people.
[01:21:31.497 --> 01:21:32.277]  They refuse.
[01:21:32.597 --> 01:21:36.859]  When they see how mean and evil these people are, they then come to him and give him the information.
[01:21:37.319 --> 01:21:43.102]  He's really gotten vital intel showing these guys are steering much of the world's apparatus.
[01:21:43.622 --> 01:21:49.624]  This is a very high-level elite group, but can you talk about some of the reportage in the past?
[01:21:49.664 --> 01:22:07.951]  Well, it's interesting you're using the term a vile and evil, Alex, because one of the opportunities I had this time in Versailles on the Saturday, if you can imagine the hotel is probably the most extravagant hotel in Paris.
[01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:10.312]  On the edge of Paris, in a beautiful suburb,
[01:22:11.411 --> 01:22:19.315]  The entire hotel was surrounded by two cordons of the French CRS, that's the riot police.
[01:22:20.315 --> 01:22:27.379]  Obviously expecting, at least because they had riot police there, we were expecting maybe some demonstrators, but no demonstrators appeared.
[01:22:27.419 --> 01:22:28.239]  Anyway, on the Saturday...
[01:22:29.176 --> 01:22:45.551]  After lunch, the Bilderbergers decided that there was obviously a sort of maybe they'd been having too many heated discussions, but then they decided to go for a little kind of tourist ride up to the actual Palace of Versailles, which is just literally a stone's throw away around the corner from the hotel that they were staying in.
[01:22:46.477 --> 01:22:49.438]  And that gave us the opportunity to get pictures of a lot of them.
[01:22:50.479 --> 01:23:00.383]  Obviously that's one of the things that they try and make sure that nobody knows who's in there before the end of the conference, before they give out their official so-called press release to the mainstream press.
[01:23:01.043 --> 01:23:07.626]  Incidentally, the BBC have got a copy of this and I phoned them up earlier on asking them to get hold of it and because they're doing a documentary they're going to keep it quiet.
[01:23:08.226 --> 01:23:15.889]  They're doing the first, as far as I know, BBC documentary on the Bilderberg meetings on the 3rd of July this year
[01:23:17.049 --> 01:23:20.870]  So, yeah, we got an opportunity to meet some of the Bilderbergers, even have a little chat with them.
[01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:22.670]  I mean, I was quite surprised.
[01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:32.313]  One of the Norwegian photographers there said, hey, there's a couple of American guys, they look like Bilderbergers, because they're all wearing the kind of suits, whereas most of the people around the palace were kind of tourists.
[01:23:32.353 --> 01:23:39.354]  But tourists were all taken by surprise, as all these quick kings and queens and stuff suddenly turned up to do a little tour of the palace.
[01:23:40.455 --> 01:23:41.295]  And walking through the...
[01:23:43.286 --> 01:23:47.910]  Park or just down back to the hotel was David Rockefeller and his bodyguard.
[01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:51.333]  So I sort of shuffled up alongside and asked a few questions.
[01:23:52.862 --> 01:24:00.626]  And it's funny that, you know, because you said these people are vile and evil, David actually came across as a very reasonable chap, you know, and I was quite surprised.
[01:24:00.666 --> 01:24:09.510]  I was almost expecting him to be, look, I'm not talking to the press, etc., but he seemed quite happy to have a bit of a chat about some of the things that go on inside the conference.
[01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:13.532]  Sir, who's that lord who John Ronson interviews and he starts yelling and cussing at him?
[01:24:13.552 --> 01:24:15.013]  Lord Healy, yes, Lord Healy.
[01:24:15.293 --> 01:24:17.934]  I mean, that guy's like, you scum sucker!
[01:24:18.375 --> 01:24:21.316]  I mean, that's how Tucker says they act.
[01:24:22.074 --> 01:24:30.540]  Well, no, I mean, some of them do and some of them don't, but I think it seems that the inner circle really don't like to kind of get angry.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:37.064]  It's only the people on the outside and the security associated with the... The people who are in the inner circle are quite calm.
[01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:38.945]  For example, I had a chat to Kenneth Clark.
[01:24:38.985 --> 01:24:41.867]  He just said, I'm sorry, I can't talk about what's going on.
[01:24:42.587 --> 01:24:44.248]  And did seem reasonably reasonable.
[01:24:44.268 --> 01:25:00.378]  I just don't like to paint these people as evil, because they are human beings, and if we're going to reach them in any way and persuade them to take on some of the subjects in the world which we want them to take on, if we demonise them, they're never going to listen.
[01:25:02.734 --> 01:25:05.317]  Well, I mean, they demonize the patriot movement.
[01:25:05.337 --> 01:25:06.738]  They demonize those that fight them.
[01:25:06.758 --> 01:25:10.041]  They have their media put out reports that they don't exist, and crazies think they do.
[01:25:10.142 --> 01:25:22.414]  The things they do are evil, and I'm going off what Tucker says, that the staff will never talk to him, but after the Bilderberg groups is so mean to him that they will talk to him.
[01:25:22.454 --> 01:25:23.395]  That's what Tucker has said.
[01:25:24.022 --> 01:25:25.463]  Yeah, I think that's true.
[01:25:25.483 --> 01:25:29.545]  I mean, some of the people in the group are, and certainly the security are over.
[01:25:29.565 --> 01:25:34.487]  I mean, for example, I was taking photographs of some of them in this kind of buggy as they were leaving.
[01:25:34.547 --> 01:25:35.067]  They had to wait.
[01:25:35.087 --> 01:25:43.271]  It was quite amusing, really, because they had to wait for about five or ten minutes, about 100 Bilderbergs, 90 or so Bilderbergs, outside the palace.
[01:25:43.291 --> 01:25:48.173]  They had to wait for five or six of the women who were with the party to finish shopping in the gift shop.
[01:25:48.573 --> 01:25:51.356]  And of course they were very embarrassed because they didn't really want photographs taken anyway.
[01:25:51.376 --> 01:25:55.840]  And the fact that they had to wait for the women in the gift shop was almost, brought the whole occasion down to earth, you know.
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:26:04.428]  So even if they are the richest and most powerful people in the world, they still have problems with, you know, people taking too long in the gift shop.
[01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:06.550]  All right, we'll take some calls when we get back.
[01:26:06.610 --> 01:26:08.852]  Any other points you want to hit on, Tony Gosling?
[01:26:09.352 --> 01:26:16.218]  I want to talk about what they were discussing in there, how you got the information, what Jim says that he's gotten if he told you.
[01:26:16.758 --> 01:26:18.380]  It's all coming up after this quick break.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.422]  By the way, we have Jim Tucker's articles on Infowars.com.
[01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:25.326]  We have a link to Vildenberg.org as well with Tony Gosling, our guest.
[01:26:25.846 --> 01:26:26.527]  So stay with us.
[01:26:26.587 --> 01:26:27.968]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 800-259-9231.
[01:26:27.988 --> 01:26:28.889]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:33.971]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:36.052]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.953 --> 01:26:39.754]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:44.818 --> 01:26:48.460]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:53.003]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:26:53.203 --> 01:26:53.804]  The Aeronizer.
[01:26:53.904 --> 01:26:56.245]  Place the filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:26:56.265 --> 01:26:56.546]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:27:15.825 --> 01:27:28.718]  Tony Gosling is a veteran BBC reporter now working with Contact Video Network and the EconoVillage Network UK, Bristol branch secretary of the National Union of Journalists.
[01:27:29.359 --> 01:27:31.121]  His website is Bilderberg.org.
[01:27:31.201 --> 01:27:32.702]  He's covered many of the conferences.
[01:27:33.263 --> 01:27:35.986]  Obviously, no one has covered more than Jim Tucker, who's joining us tomorrow.
[01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:40.913]  And we're going to take some calls coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:27:40.933 --> 01:28:01.722]  If you have any questions about the Bilderberg Group or about the things that he saw or when he talked to Queen Beatrix or David Rockefeller, because I guess that they had all their black ski mask riot police out, the Darth Vaders protecting them, the big crowds didn't show up to protest, so they decided to amble on down, I guess, in the middle of the conference to the Palace of Versailles next door from their five-star hotel.
[01:28:03.064 --> 01:28:04.125]  You get a chance to talk to him.
[01:28:04.145 --> 01:28:05.565]  I want to explore that more.
[01:28:05.585 --> 01:28:16.311]  And then we'll get to some of your calls at 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:28:17.552 --> 01:28:19.013]  You say you talked to David Rockefeller.
[01:28:19.033 --> 01:28:21.914]  What were the questions you asked him and his bodyguard?
[01:28:21.954 --> 01:28:23.015]  What responses did you get?
[01:28:23.335 --> 01:28:26.116]  You say you got a chance to talk to some of the others, Queen Beatrix.
[01:28:26.396 --> 01:28:27.277]  Tell us about that, please.
[01:28:27.657 --> 01:28:30.900]  No, I didn't get a chance to talk to Beatrix, although she was very close by.
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:34.884]  She was with a kind of whole gaggle of Bilderbergs who were visiting the hotel.
[01:28:34.904 --> 01:28:37.206]  Okay, who did you get a chance to talk to then?
[01:28:37.286 --> 01:28:38.047]  I misunderstood.
[01:28:38.067 --> 01:28:38.807]  Yeah, David Rockefeller.
[01:28:38.827 --> 01:28:41.450]  The first thing I asked him was about the press conference.
[01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:43.792]  I said, really, why don't you have a press conference?
[01:28:43.812 --> 01:28:47.155]  And he didn't actually answer the question.
[01:28:47.696 --> 01:28:49.317]  And then I pressed him a bit more, and...
[01:28:50.791 --> 01:28:56.754]  He said, well, we don't really have a lot of important things we're talking about in there.
[01:28:58.555 --> 01:29:14.783]  And I expressed my incredulity about that and explained to him that, you know, I think that what they're discussing is the exchanges about the state of the world and that these are subjects which everyone on Earth has an interest in and there are a lot of views which just simply aren't represented at Bilderberg.
[01:29:15.490 --> 01:29:18.532]  You see, they always say that they have a consensus.
[01:29:18.792 --> 01:29:33.659]  That consensus is a totally artificial consensus because they make sure that it's only people who are really already, in one way or another, into the United States of Europe or the European-American project, the war on terrorism and all this kind of stuff.
[01:29:34.219 --> 01:29:36.400]  So it's a completely artificial consensus.
[01:29:37.081 --> 01:29:42.063]  So I pressed him on the idea of having a press conference and he said he didn't think it was a good idea.
[01:29:42.183 --> 01:29:43.304]  And I said, well, all the time,
[01:29:43.917 --> 01:29:46.558]  Tony, you have all these big industrialists, all the big bankers.
[01:30:08.582 --> 01:30:09.023]  We're good to go.
[01:30:09.043 --> 01:30:09.183]  I think?
[01:30:26.318 --> 01:30:27.159]  I think we're good to go.
[01:30:41.329 --> 01:30:44.731]  August 10, 1973, about the death of Mao Zedong.
[01:30:45.091 --> 01:30:54.416]  Whatever the price of the Chinese Revolution, it has obviously succeeded, not only in producing more efficient and dedicated administration, but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose.
[01:30:54.776 --> 01:31:00.479]  The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.
[01:31:00.859 --> 01:31:04.221]  David Rockefeller's statement in 1973 about Mao Zedong, New York Times, August 10, 1973.
[01:31:06.222 --> 01:31:08.163]  So, you know, that's evil.
[01:31:08.523 --> 01:31:13.866]  And David Rockefeller is a globalist whose policies are set up to destroy America.
[01:31:14.246 --> 01:31:16.007]  We know the Carnegie Endowment's doing that.
[01:31:16.367 --> 01:31:18.748]  We know what these people are about, and I'll say it.
[01:31:20.993 --> 01:31:22.073]  Yeah.
[01:31:22.213 --> 01:31:29.815]  Well, the other thing, of course, is that they say that they invite Russians as well, and you're quite right, the Carnegie Endowment are the people that come, which, of course, is an American organisation.
[01:31:30.195 --> 01:31:43.819]  So they're not, I mean, even though they try and make out that their borders aren't just NATO, European Union, you know, and Canada, these most powerful of the Western countries, I would imagine, you know, for many people outside the Western world,
[01:31:44.409 --> 01:31:44.890]  We're good to go.
[01:31:55.546 --> 01:31:56.326]  I think we're good to go.
[01:32:15.994 --> 01:32:23.965]  And again, he just sort of gave me a bit of an anodyne reply, saying, well, this isn't the kind of thing we normally talk about, and, you know, well, no excuse, really.
[01:32:24.166 --> 01:32:29.413]  Oh, sure, they don't talk about international banking and the debt with third world countries, sure.
[01:32:31.078 --> 01:32:33.800]  It's one of the things that definitely should be on the agenda.
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:42.767]  Now, Big Jim Tucker has said that in his articles that this is illegal because of our laws in this country to have public officials in secret meetings with private institutions.
[01:32:43.148 --> 01:32:44.229]  He says it's illegal.
[01:32:44.769 --> 01:32:47.952]  Well, if there have been any prosecutions, I'd like to see a test case.
[01:32:47.972 --> 01:32:48.952]  That would be very interesting.
[01:32:49.333 --> 01:32:55.858]  Also, in the European, I've only just found out today that there were questions asked about Bilderberg in the European Parliament at the end of last month.
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:01.344]  And they had to admit that there were going to be three of the European commissioners.
[01:33:01.784 --> 01:33:10.332]  Now, I don't know how well Americans know how European structures work, but basically Europe is being run now by a commission of appointed people.
[01:33:10.352 --> 01:33:13.515]  I mean, none of them are elected.
[01:33:13.575 --> 01:33:17.559]  Nobody can elect them out of office, even if they turn into tyrants.
[01:33:17.879 --> 01:33:26.484]  Well, they wouldn't allow... This is a serious problem over in Europe of actually raising consciousness, and maybe in the States as well, to make people realise that this is a totally appointed body.
[01:33:26.824 --> 01:33:36.229]  And the laughable thing is that most of the commissioners, if not all of the commissioners, certainly all the ones I know from the UK, have been failed politicians, politicians that people have voted out.
[01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:41.713]  And now they're then promoted to an invulnerable position of running Europe as part of the European government.
[01:33:42.093 --> 01:33:45.835]  In fact, Romano Prodi, who's the chairman of the European Commission...
[01:33:46.368 --> 01:33:48.729]  Well, that's the point I'm trying to make here is that
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.762]  Is that whether it's regionalism in this country, you'll have the states and regional groupings.
[01:34:15.362 --> 01:34:17.543]  You have an unelected board running things.
[01:34:17.844 --> 01:34:21.605]  Well, you're always talking about Romano Prodi as the president of Europe.
[01:34:21.825 --> 01:34:27.147]  Let me just finish this real quick, Tony, because this regionalism, we have counties that are in regional government with unelected people.
[01:34:27.488 --> 01:34:28.328]  We have the states.
[01:34:28.368 --> 01:34:29.428]  We have the federal government.
[01:34:29.708 --> 01:34:31.029]  We have this system.
[01:34:31.429 --> 01:34:35.571]  And now you talk about the EU where they won't even allow people to have votes on referendums.
[01:34:35.871 --> 01:34:37.312]  Yeah, this guy has never been voted in.
[01:34:37.352 --> 01:34:39.372]  He's now being talked about as the president of Europe.
[01:34:39.492 --> 01:34:41.293]  In fact, he's another failed politician.
[01:34:42.373 --> 01:34:51.797]  It just seems to me as if the people who are running, certainly the Bilderbergs, the people who are running Europe, are really poking one in the eye to the public.
[01:34:52.017 --> 01:34:53.718]  So it's dictatorship on the face of it, sir.
[01:34:53.858 --> 01:34:54.778]  Let's just call it what it is.
[01:34:54.798 --> 01:34:54.998]  Yeah, well...
[01:35:00.205 --> 01:35:02.026]  I mean, at least it has the potential for that.
[01:35:02.046 --> 01:35:04.708]  I don't think it's quite got that bad right now.
[01:35:04.828 --> 01:35:05.269]  Oh, really?
[01:35:05.309 --> 01:35:17.058]  I mean, we need to always have checks and balances in our politics to make sure that we can get... Well, you've got the presidency and it's going to be appointed, and they're getting rid of juries and getting rid of rights and passing thought crime laws.
[01:35:17.118 --> 01:35:18.038]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:35:18.278 --> 01:35:24.003]  Yeah, it's certainly frightening when you look at Hitler's dream, Fortress Europe, you know,
[01:35:25.364 --> 01:35:28.627]  And now it's kind of almost as if it's all happening all over again.
[01:35:29.808 --> 01:35:32.811]  I know, Tony Gosling, you've got other key points you want to add.
[01:35:32.831 --> 01:35:33.852]  We've been so honored to have you.
[01:35:33.872 --> 01:35:39.117]  We've got some callers that want to talk to you about these issues.
[01:35:39.177 --> 01:35:44.903]  Can I just finish by saying a little bit about my website and about what I've decided to do with it?
[01:35:45.223 --> 01:35:48.246]  Sure, we'll discuss that, and then we've got to go straight to these calls.
[01:35:48.266 --> 01:35:49.387]  Okay, just very, very quickly.
[01:35:49.407 --> 01:35:54.231]  First of all, I mean, after this year, this is only the second Bilderberg meeting I've actually been to.
[01:35:54.291 --> 01:35:58.794]  Most I've been covering from my office, just sort of taking information and putting them up.
[01:35:58.834 --> 01:36:07.161]  But after this meeting, I really made a decision that I was going to try and get to all meetings, as many as I could in the future, until they have a press conference.
[01:36:07.722 --> 01:36:12.926]  Even if it's on the last day, you know, and a few people will be rolled out to talk to the press,
[01:36:13.675 --> 01:36:19.960]  Because the main thing I dislike about it is their ability to completely close down the free press in France.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:22.842]  It's really quite unnerving.
[01:36:23.122 --> 01:36:27.926]  Does that include, Tony, their staring meetings that they have with leaders of our government?
[01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:30.210]  Well, I'm not sure.
[01:36:30.230 --> 01:36:35.354]  I mean, all I know is that when they have their annual conference, there is almost no coverage.
[01:36:35.374 --> 01:36:38.657]  And we heard this year that they have ordered a press blackout.
[01:36:38.777 --> 01:36:42.941]  So the fact that these people can just say, no, there will be no coverage, I find itself frightening.
[01:36:43.201 --> 01:36:48.305]  Well, they also have the armies of governments generally are also there protecting them.
[01:36:48.905 --> 01:36:50.046]  Was that the case this year?
[01:36:51.067 --> 01:36:55.531]  Well, there certainly seemed to be a lot of what I suppose you have to call secret service.
[01:36:55.571 --> 01:36:58.193]  We had watchers on us, I mean, the group of journalists that were there,
[01:36:58.891 --> 01:36:59.431]  Well, sir?
[01:36:59.451 --> 01:37:00.092]  They didn't ask me.
[01:37:28.945 --> 01:37:38.251]  Yeah, you should be free to do that.
[01:37:38.271 --> 01:37:39.472]  But let me just add another point here.
[01:37:39.512 --> 01:37:40.353]  This is important.
[01:37:40.913 --> 01:37:46.217]  We've had journalists arrested, basically kidnapped out of their hotel rooms or off the street in the past.
[01:37:46.878 --> 01:37:52.162]  John Ronson has video of the dark cars with the men in sunglasses following him and Jim Tucker around.
[01:37:52.882 --> 01:37:54.082]  So we know this goes on.
[01:37:54.342 --> 01:37:55.163]  Yeah.
[01:37:55.283 --> 01:37:58.523]  Yeah, I mean, all of the security was done by the French state.
[01:37:59.043 --> 01:38:04.284]  So, I mean, for them to say that it's a private meeting, I think, is really not credible at all.
[01:38:04.664 --> 01:38:13.946]  I mean, they seem to try out a lot of these things, meeting to meeting, just saying that either it's a private meeting or that it's nothing to do with government.
[01:38:14.006 --> 01:38:22.288]  And then you see all these top government officials, for example, they had the Foreign Minister of France and the Home, what I think they call Ministry of the Interior of France at the meeting,
[01:38:23.118 --> 01:38:27.919]  And of course, at least it's involving the government.
[01:38:27.939 --> 01:38:29.339]  So they can't say it's a private meeting.
[01:38:29.359 --> 01:38:32.100]  We've got some of the most powerful people in Europe in government positions there.
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:39.982]  I want to talk about some of the information that you found out of what was being discussed inside Bilderberg, because that bodes for the next year.
[01:38:40.022 --> 01:38:41.782]  But right now, let's go to Ken in Texas.
[01:38:41.822 --> 01:38:42.602]  Ken, thanks for holding.
[01:38:42.842 --> 01:38:45.663]  You're on the air with our guest, Tony Gosling of Bilderberg.org.
[01:38:45.683 --> 01:38:46.023]  Go ahead.
[01:38:49.589 --> 01:38:50.870]  Alex, I listen to your show all the time.
[01:38:50.890 --> 01:38:51.511]  I'm a big fan.
[01:38:51.831 --> 01:38:52.512]  Well, thank you, Ken.
[01:38:52.552 --> 01:38:53.052]  You're on the air.
[01:38:53.072 --> 01:38:53.693]  What's on your mind?
[01:38:54.373 --> 01:39:14.329]  Well, you know, this Bilderberg group, they're one of several groups that have this sort of superhuman ability, and their staff are populated or whatever by people who are rich and have been throughout their lineage for generations, rich beyond the wildest dreams of your average person.
[01:39:15.169 --> 01:39:16.610]  And they have the power...
[01:39:19.011 --> 01:39:20.272]  If money equals power, you know.
[01:39:20.873 --> 01:39:38.867]  They have the power to do anything they want, send mercenaries out, sort of cull and cultivate their own diplomats and, you know, put people into office through fellowships and pick the people they want to put through college and put in fraternities.
[01:39:38.967 --> 01:39:41.469]  I don't know.
[01:39:41.549 --> 01:39:45.372]  I think it's really kind of frightening how untouchable these people seem to be.
[01:39:47.902 --> 01:39:50.183]  Well, I can say that they're not untouchable.
[01:39:50.463 --> 01:39:52.283]  You can go up and shake one's hand if you want.
[01:39:52.323 --> 01:39:59.064]  In fact, a guy who's been a photographer at the Bilderberg meetings for quite a long time, Chris, who works for American Free Press, is now living in Germany.
[01:39:59.764 --> 01:40:01.265]  And he's always good fun.
[01:40:01.305 --> 01:40:03.625]  You know, he's always got a good sense of humour.
[01:40:04.005 --> 01:40:10.167]  And, you know, I think this is one of the ways to, if you want, trump the Bilderbergers, is with humour.
[01:40:10.187 --> 01:40:11.967]  Because what they do is kind of insane.
[01:40:12.427 --> 01:40:15.768]  I'm sure they feel like it's petting a puppy on the head or something.
[01:40:15.788 --> 01:40:16.548]  But yeah, I don't
[01:40:40.546 --> 01:40:44.948]  I don't think these people have any kind of connection with what the average person goes through in their life.
[01:40:45.348 --> 01:40:53.372]  Well, Ken, we've got Rockefeller telling Tony Gosling that, oh, we're not talking about anything serious in this meeting.
[01:40:53.513 --> 01:40:55.193]  No, just bicycle parts and stuff.
[01:40:56.594 --> 01:40:56.934]  Yeah.
[01:40:57.214 --> 01:41:01.477]  Well, he's admitting that they have exchanges about the state of the world.
[01:41:01.897 --> 01:41:07.219]  But what he's saying is that this is something that's got to be private.
[01:41:07.259 --> 01:41:10.201]  When you've got people that are so rich that they literally can...
[01:41:11.073 --> 01:41:11.634]  We're good to go.
[01:41:11.654 --> 01:41:12.314]  I think?
[01:41:31.730 --> 01:41:32.390]  The gophers.
[01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:34.791]  Yeah, point is generals and gophers, exactly.
[01:41:34.811 --> 01:41:37.633]  Was Henry Kissinger there, Tony?
[01:41:37.873 --> 01:41:39.333]  Yeah, he was, although I didn't see him.
[01:41:39.473 --> 01:41:44.555]  I had a definite confirmation from a very trusted source inside the hotel that he was definitely there.
[01:41:45.016 --> 01:41:47.136]  And what were some of the agendas they were discussing?
[01:41:47.517 --> 01:41:55.320]  Well, as I mentioned before, they were talking about the European army and they were talking about Iraq.
[01:41:55.908 --> 01:42:00.355]  But, I mean, they have issued an agenda summary.
[01:42:00.736 --> 01:42:09.550]  They say, and it usually is a pretty good indication of what's been being discussed, they say that they were looking at European-American relations.
[01:42:10.685 --> 01:42:17.469]  And in this context, Iraq, the Middle East after terrorism, non-proliferation, I mean, I would imagine that means North Korea.
[01:42:19.570 --> 01:42:21.731]  He says with a bit of a grim laugh.
[01:42:21.831 --> 01:42:31.756]  The European Convention, which of course, I don't know if Americans have been following this, but we have a convention at the moment over a constitution for Europe, is really making sure that...
[01:42:34.717 --> 01:42:41.700]  And in the middle of this, we've got Rumsfeld and Pearl running around.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:44.921]  Yeah, I have to say, I'm not actually sure about Rumsfeld.
[01:42:44.961 --> 01:42:47.181]  I'd heard he was there, but didn't speak to anyone.
[01:42:47.201 --> 01:42:49.282]  Well, this is out of the Asia Times.
[01:42:49.822 --> 01:42:52.083]  Yeah, okay, well, I'm glad to hear it.
[01:42:52.103 --> 01:42:56.344]  See, we can start to piece together a participant list, even though we don't have it publicly.
[01:42:57.454 --> 01:42:59.435]  From little bits of information that come from here and there.
[01:42:59.475 --> 01:43:05.276]  But really, ultimately, we really should have an official list from the Bilderbergs, and they're refusing to let me have it this year.
[01:43:05.296 --> 01:43:07.416]  Who were the independent reporters that were there?
[01:43:07.476 --> 01:43:12.358]  Did you see this reporter from the Times of Asia?
[01:43:12.558 --> 01:43:13.538]  No, I didn't see him.
[01:43:13.578 --> 01:43:15.558]  There were people back and forth the whole time.
[01:43:15.698 --> 01:43:22.700]  In fact, one of the things I'd love to say to your listeners is it actually is a really interesting thing to come and do.
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:23.640]  I snuck in too.
[01:43:51.135 --> 01:43:52.716]  Yeah, I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[01:43:52.736 --> 01:43:53.456]  Were you aware of that?
[01:43:53.777 --> 01:43:54.037]  Yeah.
[01:43:55.317 --> 01:43:55.918]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:43:55.958 --> 01:43:59.760]  I mean, I think it's also possible for ordinary members of the public.
[01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:02.982]  Some of the Parisians turned up and were really helpful.
[01:44:03.002 --> 01:44:13.187]  For example, doing things like translating between people who were working in the hotel and the journalists so we could understand what they were saying because some of the staff of the hotel didn't speak English.
[01:44:14.148 --> 01:44:17.590]  And you get a kind of little collection of people at every Bilderberg conference
[01:44:18.152 --> 01:44:19.793]  We're good to go.
[01:44:19.813 --> 01:44:19.953]  I think?
[01:44:31.678 --> 01:44:35.762]  Really giving the BBC a hard time about their coverage of September the 11th, for example.
[01:44:36.562 --> 01:44:39.485]  And you end up with almost like an alternative conference at the venue.
[01:44:39.765 --> 01:44:40.226]  All right.
[01:44:40.306 --> 01:44:41.627]  Or around the corner from the venue.
[01:44:41.667 --> 01:44:43.028]  Stay right there, Tony Gosselin.
[01:44:43.048 --> 01:44:43.889]  Thanks for the call, Ken.
[01:44:44.289 --> 01:44:49.254]  More calls coming up for our guests on the other side of this quick break at 800-259-9231.
[01:44:49.534 --> 01:44:52.316]  Tony Gosselin, Bilderberg.org.
[01:44:52.336 --> 01:44:53.638]  We really appreciate him coming on.
[01:44:53.678 --> 01:44:54.899]  We've got some more time with him.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:56.422]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:44:56.503 --> 01:44:59.170]  My websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:44:59.190 --> 01:45:01.155]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:45:01.195 --> 01:45:01.696]  More coming up.
[01:45:01.716 --> 01:45:02.077]  Stay with us.
[01:45:03.968 --> 01:45:10.774]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:45:11.135 --> 01:45:12.496]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:45:12.696 --> 01:45:14.898]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:45:15.058 --> 01:45:17.140]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:22.345]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:45:22.685 --> 01:45:26.729]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:45:26.969 --> 01:45:28.751]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:45:28.811 --> 01:45:39.461]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:45:39.621 --> 01:45:41.523]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:45:41.723 --> 01:45:45.587]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:45:45.687 --> 01:45:46.969]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:45:50.692 --> 01:45:51.553]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:45:51.853 --> 01:45:57.779]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:45:58.740]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:46:04.582 --> 01:46:09.064]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:46:09.424 --> 01:46:13.506]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:46:13.806 --> 01:46:14.346]  We listened.
[01:46:14.666 --> 01:46:19.648]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:46:19.908 --> 01:46:20.389]  We listened.
[01:46:20.789 --> 01:46:23.830]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:46:24.250 --> 01:46:24.790]  We listened.
[01:46:25.251 --> 01:46:28.572]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:46:28.632 --> 01:46:28.992]  We're good.
[01:46:55.150 --> 01:46:56.251]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:46:56.371 --> 01:46:57.772]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:47:19.810 --> 01:47:20.451]  We're good to go.
[01:47:40.011 --> 01:47:40.672]  We're good to go.
[01:48:08.078 --> 01:48:09.738]  Folks, I've studied the Bilderberg Group.
[01:48:09.798 --> 01:48:10.719]  I know who goes to it.
[01:48:10.739 --> 01:48:11.619]  I know their past.
[01:48:11.879 --> 01:48:18.461]  Nazis, war criminals, international bankers, people that love Lenin and Stalin and Mao.
[01:48:19.521 --> 01:48:21.121]  I've read their quotes here that are public.
[01:48:21.982 --> 01:48:23.422]  They want to enslave you and your family.
[01:48:23.442 --> 01:48:25.142]  They're a bunch of degenerate control freaks.
[01:48:25.182 --> 01:48:26.603]  Maybe some of them aren't pure evil.
[01:48:26.623 --> 01:48:31.384]  Maybe the minions are presidents that go or presidential hopefuls that go to present themselves before them.
[01:48:32.299 --> 01:48:34.081]  Aren't pure evil, but once they get into this, they are.
[01:48:34.121 --> 01:48:34.581]  I'll say it.
[01:48:34.601 --> 01:48:35.322]  I'll tell it like it is.
[01:48:35.362 --> 01:48:36.663]  I've been to Bohemian Grove, folks.
[01:48:36.703 --> 01:48:38.604]  I've seen what they do, what they're about.
[01:48:38.644 --> 01:48:49.052]  We're talking to Tony Gosling, former BBC reporter, documentary producer, Bristol Branch union secretary, the National Union of Journalists.
[01:48:49.112 --> 01:48:50.874]  Joining us, his website's boulderberg.org.

[01:48:57.786 --> 01:48:58.526]  It's now out.
[01:48:59.206 --> 01:49:01.208]  It is two hours and 37 minutes long.
[01:49:01.228 --> 01:49:07.812]  You want to know what these people are really about, what their crimes are, the terror attacks the globalists carry out, and what they're going to give you in the future.
[01:49:09.005 --> 01:49:23.750]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, click on the shopping cart, get the videos, make copies for non-profit, not for sale educational purposes, spread the word, get my book, Dissent into Tyranny, find out the truth about 9-1-1, get the information, or call toll-free to get the films at 1-888-

[01:49:28.852 --> 01:49:36.656]  Don't procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:49:37.816 --> 01:49:38.797]  Get them out to the people.
[01:49:38.897 --> 01:49:41.919]  Awaken the nation, the world, to this dehumanizing threat.
[01:49:42.279 --> 01:49:48.922]  Again, 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or net.
[01:49:48.942 --> 01:49:50.983]  And I really enjoyed having Tony Gosling on.
[01:49:51.003 --> 01:49:52.044]  He'll be on with us a little bit.
[01:49:52.464 --> 01:49:53.265]  Into the next hour.
[01:49:53.285 --> 01:49:55.508]  Pam in Missouri, you're on with our guest.
[01:49:55.548 --> 01:49:56.028]  Go ahead.
[01:49:56.849 --> 01:49:57.530]  Hello, Alex.
[01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:58.331]  Hello, Pam.
[01:49:58.771 --> 01:49:59.872]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:50:00.093 --> 01:50:02.896]  I just had to tell Mr. Gosling, is that it?
[01:50:03.797 --> 01:50:09.183]  He sounds like he really enjoys being with these people and et cetera, et cetera.
[01:50:09.884 --> 01:50:13.648]  I just have to tell him I wouldn't let these people in my home.
[01:50:15.257 --> 01:50:19.060]  Hold on guys, you're talking over each other.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.021]  Hold on a second.
[01:50:20.141 --> 01:50:23.183]  Can I just answer that?
[01:50:23.263 --> 01:50:24.404]  Let me just say this.
[01:50:24.784 --> 01:50:26.565]  He is a gentleman, you know, he is from England.
[01:50:26.585 --> 01:50:27.606]  Go ahead.
[01:50:27.626 --> 01:50:31.409]  What I enjoy is the company of the other people who are also covering Bilderberg.
[01:50:31.889 --> 01:50:35.591]  I don't actually see anybody in the conference really hardly at all.
[01:50:35.611 --> 01:50:37.433]  We were very lucky on the Saturday.
[01:50:37.993 --> 01:50:43.874]  But, you know, it's really an experience of a bit of real journalism.
[01:50:43.894 --> 01:50:45.475]  She may have misunderstood you.
[01:50:45.495 --> 01:50:48.676]  You better be careful because they sure can deceive you.
[01:50:49.316 --> 01:50:50.356]  And give them a message.
[01:50:50.416 --> 01:50:52.617]  They better read Defini Chapter 1.
[01:50:53.957 --> 01:50:54.337]  Okay?
[01:50:54.757 --> 01:50:55.017]  Yeah.
[01:50:55.177 --> 01:50:55.777]  Thank you.
[01:50:55.797 --> 01:50:56.137]  Thank you.
[01:50:56.177 --> 01:51:01.879]  I think Pam listening may have heard you talk about the other conference and thought that she may have misheard or something, Tony.
[01:51:03.138 --> 01:51:03.918]  Well, that's okay.
[01:51:03.958 --> 01:51:23.745]  It's just that, you know, I mean, I don't go along there just to... But I think it is interesting when you go to these meetings of people who are so incredibly powerful, and they are very powerful, very rich people, that, you know, you do feel that the money also comes with the money, a great deal of embarrassment, because they have to hide all the time.
[01:51:23.765 --> 01:51:30.387]  They're kind of... They're winkled away in some kind of place where they can't be got out by the public.
[01:51:30.427 --> 01:51:32.248]  So if they have so much to hide...
[01:51:33.529 --> 01:51:40.213]  That immediately gets me worried, and I want to make sure that the information that is around on these people is the facts.
[01:51:40.253 --> 01:51:41.914]  We've got as much as we can of the facts.
[01:51:42.414 --> 01:51:51.400]  Because I think one thing that always happens is that you get the kind of mixture of really wild conspiracy theory with fact, which then completely discredits the Bilderberg.
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:52:01.606]  And one of the reasons why mainstream journalists, you're talking about people writing for the Independent in this country, BBC people, etc., stay well clear of it when there's all this kind of crazy conspiracy theory as well.
[01:52:02.506 --> 01:52:05.589]  Well, I mean, there's no crazy conspiracy theory about David Ruffalo.
[01:52:05.649 --> 01:52:06.790]  I'm talking about lizards.
[01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:12.735]  People seriously, you know, David Icke, for example, is seriously going around saying these people are lizards, which is, you know, it doesn't really help matters.
[01:52:13.283 --> 01:52:18.725]  Well, yeah, what that does is it then discredits the whole, and I see what you're talking about there, Tony.
[01:52:19.325 --> 01:52:20.786]  We've only got one more segment with you.
[01:52:20.826 --> 01:52:27.269]  I want to, when we get back, I want to talk about, did Jim Tucker, he's coming on tomorrow, but did Jim give you any scoops that he got that you didn't get?
[01:52:27.449 --> 01:52:30.550]  He's very generous, Jim.
[01:52:30.570 --> 01:52:32.871]  He makes sure that each evening in the hotel...
[01:52:33.351 --> 01:52:35.091]  We all sit down and share information together.
[01:52:35.111 --> 01:52:37.532]  So we know what's going on with Jim.
[01:52:37.772 --> 01:52:43.234]  Well, I want to find out some of the things you learned from him and other journalists that were there and who some of the other folks that were there were.
[01:52:43.314 --> 01:52:44.474]  We haven't gotten to that point yet.
[01:52:44.974 --> 01:52:45.614]  One minute break.
[01:52:45.634 --> 01:52:47.175]  We'll be back with the third and final hour.
[01:52:47.255 --> 01:52:50.295]  I've got a bunch of news after our guest leaves us and your calls.
[01:52:50.695 --> 01:52:51.336]  So stay with us.
[01:52:51.356 --> 01:52:52.336]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:52:55.257 --> 01:52:58.357]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:52:58.637 --> 01:53:01.118]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio
[01:53:04.770 --> 01:53:05.150]  Big Brother.
[01:53:08.933 --> 01:53:10.014]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:10.054 --> 01:53:11.235]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:11.275 --> 01:53:12.176]  You want answers?
[01:53:15.018 --> 01:53:18.100]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.731 --> 01:53:31.353]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.914 --> 01:53:36.016]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.997 --> 01:53:42.700]  Already in the third and final hour of this worldwide broadcast, more of your calls coming up.
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:48.544]  We've been talking about the Bilderberg Group for much of the last hour with Tony Gosselin for years.
[01:53:48.624 --> 01:53:51.226]  He's been covering the Bilderberg Group and he's been to several other conferences.
[01:53:51.266 --> 01:53:53.247]  He just got back from Versailles, France.
[01:53:54.915 --> 01:54:00.159]  And has been giving us a lot of interesting information from in and around the organization.
[01:54:00.219 --> 01:54:03.562]  Coming up, more on the bombings in Turkey and at Yale.
[01:54:04.602 --> 01:54:08.986]  Out in Connecticut, we'll talk about the mad cow situation up in Canada.
[01:54:09.026 --> 01:54:12.909]  We'll talk about the military on highest domestic terror threat alert here domestically.
[01:54:12.949 --> 01:54:16.031]  A quake kills more than 640 in Algeria.
[01:54:16.772 --> 01:54:22.516]  We'll get into some of the police state news and how the allies begin seizing weapons from most Iraqis, something Saddam didn't do.
[01:54:23.331 --> 01:54:26.652]  Tony Gosling is our last segment with you, and I appreciate you with us in the last hour.
[01:54:27.213 --> 01:54:35.716]  Any other key areas you want to hit on, and who were some of the other journalists who were there, and what are some other tidbits of info you have for us from in and around the Bilderberg Group meeting?
[01:54:36.337 --> 01:54:47.081]  Well, the other journalists who were covering the conference were, there was a newspaper from Norway, but the one thing that is common between all of the journalists there is they're all from independence.
[01:54:47.101 --> 01:54:48.762]  It's funny, because whenever someone turns up,
[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:52.681]  We always quiz them, almost knowing what the answer's going to be.
[01:54:52.701 --> 01:54:54.601]  You know, say, oh, who owns your newspaper?
[01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:56.121]  And sometimes they have to think twice, even.
[01:54:56.141 --> 01:54:57.902]  You know, oh, it's owned by this guy or this guy.
[01:54:58.522 --> 01:55:07.304]  And, of course, it's always either kind of rich entrepreneurs that have started their own newspaper or else their own radio station or whatever that cover it.
[01:55:07.384 --> 01:55:12.345]  So there's never anyone from any of the main networks of television, radio.
[01:55:12.405 --> 01:55:18.326]  But we were very lucky, I think, this time to have the BBC along because it seems like they're going to be doing something which is reasonably critical.
[01:55:19.427 --> 01:55:21.789]  I just got a profile of Martin Taylor...
[01:55:46.952 --> 01:55:50.235]  He's the ex-head of Barclays Bank, now running several companies in Britain.
[01:55:51.016 --> 01:56:00.924]  And it turns out that he also has a non-executive directorship of quite a nasty-looking genetics company.
[01:56:01.519 --> 01:56:04.680]  Which is doing personalised medicine.
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:14.302]  So basically they take your blood, they examine your genes, pull your genes apart, decide what they think's wrong, and design a special, very expensive pill for you to take that's going to cure you.
[01:56:14.322 --> 01:56:16.602]  These are the kind of things, business interests that they're into.
[01:56:16.642 --> 01:56:30.525]  And we were joking, saying, well, hang on a minute, how about if your Norwegian newspaper does a weekly column checking the Bilderberg stocks so they can follow what the Bilderbergs are investing in and sort of hopefully get a better return?
[01:56:32.017 --> 01:56:32.778]  It's amazing.
[01:56:32.958 --> 01:56:48.070]  And you take all these powerful people, duchesses and dukes and kings and queens and bankers and presidents and prime ministers and defense secretaries, and you put them all together, combining their power, it's just incredible.
[01:56:48.090 --> 01:56:52.754]  And, of course, they all scratch each other's backs and are bringing us this world government.
[01:56:52.774 --> 01:56:53.594]  That's obvious.
[01:56:53.634 --> 01:56:55.556]  They promote globalism and getting rid of our...
[01:56:56.249 --> 01:57:05.616]  Getting rid of our national sovereignty, but unfortunately the mainstream talk show hosts out there like Neil Bortz and others don't talk about these subjects.
[01:57:06.077 --> 01:57:13.102]  It's all left-wing, right-wing when both the left and the right are controlled by these same organizations, these same people.
[01:57:13.924 --> 01:57:31.012]  Well, it's also interesting that some of the journalists are left-wing journalists and some are right-wing journalists, and yet we all seem to be quite happily able to get along fine and share information, because we find that although maybe we're taking a left-wing or a right-wing slant on events, if you want to use those terms,
[01:57:31.710 --> 01:57:35.013]  That none of us are extremists and we're just there to do our job.
[01:57:35.073 --> 01:57:40.878]  And so the fact that we've got certain expertise is from the right and certain other ones from the left.
[01:57:41.358 --> 01:57:45.742]  And, you know, people often quote me as an expert on Build a Boat, but I'm not really.
[01:57:46.023 --> 01:57:48.585]  You know, this is a kind of hobby that went wrong, you know.
[01:57:49.245 --> 01:57:49.765]  Absolutely.
[01:57:49.805 --> 01:57:52.947]  Listen, I've got to let you go, Tony Gosling.
[01:57:52.987 --> 01:57:54.408]  I really appreciate you coming on the show.
[01:57:54.428 --> 01:57:55.308]  We'll talk to you in the future.
[01:57:55.328 --> 01:57:56.489]  Okay, no problem, Alex.
[01:57:56.869 --> 01:57:57.490]  Take care, sir.
[01:57:57.510 --> 01:58:00.171]  I really do appreciate you joining us on the show today.
[01:58:00.431 --> 01:58:01.592]  We'll be back, folks.
[01:58:01.612 --> 01:58:05.594]  We've got a lot of other news and information to cover here on the show.
[01:58:05.854 --> 01:58:07.715]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:08.355 --> 01:58:12.958]  And again, the websites are infowars.com, infowars.net, and prisonplanet.com.
[01:58:12.978 --> 01:58:13.338]  Stay with us.
[01:58:15.296 --> 01:58:16.897]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:17.257 --> 01:58:23.000]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:28.403]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:58:28.743 --> 01:58:38.008]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:58:38.368 --> 01:58:43.311]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:58:43.651 --> 01:58:47.673]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:58:47.853 --> 01:58:52.636]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:58:52.996 --> 01:58:58.899]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:59:15.871 --> 01:59:23.254]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:23.534 --> 01:59:28.276]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:28.496 --> 01:59:34.138]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:34.378 --> 01:59:38.900]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:59:39.121 --> 01:59:46.284]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:59:46.304 --> 01:59:50.847]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:59:51.007 --> 01:59:53.528]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:59:53.748 --> 02:00:00.452]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:00:00.692 --> 02:00:05.957]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:05.977 --> 02:00:06.378]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:00:14.719 --> 02:00:19.021]  I have tried many other diets to lose weight and I have not been successful.
[02:00:19.181 --> 02:00:24.102]  Here's more that have lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagen-8 from Vim and Vigor.
[02:00:24.323 --> 02:00:29.544]  With Vim and Vigor, I have already lost 28 pounds and I am looking forward to losing more.
[02:00:29.644 --> 02:00:36.147]  I'm an athletic trainer so it intrigued me and I have noticed my skin is softer, my hair
[02:00:36.527 --> 02:00:38.248]  I've gotten shinier and healthier.
[02:00:38.489 --> 02:00:39.710]  My nails are healthier.
[02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:40.871]  I have more energy.
[02:00:41.431 --> 02:00:44.133]  And I also have noticed weight loss.
[02:00:44.353 --> 02:00:49.558]  Over the years, I've tried many, many products, and I've never experienced anything like collagenate.
[02:00:49.738 --> 02:00:52.440]  I'd be happy to recommend Vigor Collagenate.
[02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:54.701]  I have lost 28 pounds so far.
[02:00:55.001 --> 02:00:55.922]  I feel great.
[02:00:56.102 --> 02:00:59.743]  That was their personal experience while taking Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[02:00:59.883 --> 02:01:00.844]  What are you waiting for?
[02:01:01.104 --> 02:01:04.125]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN and get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.

[02:01:20.450 --> 02:01:22.732]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:31.084 --> 02:01:31.725]  We're good to go.
[02:01:54.984 --> 02:01:57.427]  All right, folks, we're on the air.
[02:01:57.467 --> 02:02:00.110]  I'm Alex Jones, already into the third and final hour.
[02:02:00.170 --> 02:02:02.453]  We will take more calls in this hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:02.493 --> 02:02:02.733]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:02:11.465 --> 02:02:14.106]  And here is some of the news we're going to be going over.
[02:02:14.166 --> 02:02:16.866]  Again, a blast hit Istanbul restaurant.
[02:02:16.886 --> 02:02:25.669]  That's two bombings in Turkey, a bombing in Morocco, a bombing in Saudi Arabia, four bombings in Israel, now a bombing at Yale.
[02:02:26.529 --> 02:02:29.069]  Up in Connecticut, the president's alma mater.
[02:02:29.710 --> 02:02:34.671]  And the globalists have got us on orange alert saying brace for more attacks, give up all your rights.
[02:02:35.687 --> 02:02:38.050]  Basically is the whole line that we're seeing.
[02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:41.653]  The world is shunning Canadian beef over mad cow fears.
[02:02:42.614 --> 02:02:58.369]  Reuters reporting the world has slammed the door on Canadian beef and cattle Wednesday fearing a mad cow disease outbreak as inspectors sealed off more farms while racing to trace the origin of the animal confirmed as the country's first case in a decade.
[02:02:58.649 --> 02:02:59.109]  We're good to go.
[02:03:19.296 --> 02:03:21.278]  Grind nearly to a halt, officials said.
[02:03:21.338 --> 02:03:22.319]  The closing of the U.S.
[02:03:22.359 --> 02:03:24.380]  border is the biggest impact.
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:31.986]  Alberta beef producers general manager Gary Sarget told Reuters, but we're starting to see a cascading effect now.
[02:03:32.466 --> 02:03:40.593]  The packing plants going to partial days are not opening at all, and auction markets taking a break for a week to let the situation stabilize.
[02:03:41.153 --> 02:03:45.337]  Folks, there's no way to avoid beef products unless you grow it yourself or I guess go to a health food store.
[02:04:04.648 --> 02:04:07.770]  The capsules around pills, in many cases, are made out of it.
[02:04:08.490 --> 02:04:10.651]  It's in thousands of products.
[02:04:10.711 --> 02:04:11.852]  It's all over the place.
[02:04:11.912 --> 02:04:13.113]  It's in dog food.
[02:04:13.593 --> 02:04:14.393]  It's everywhere.
[02:04:15.394 --> 02:04:23.998]  And it's not bad enough that the government has allowed people to feed meat products, byproducts to cows and sheep and creatures that don't eat meat, herbivores.
[02:04:25.219 --> 02:04:32.043]  Now they're feeding rotten meat products full of toxins and chemicals that then lodge in the brain and grow crystals.
[02:04:32.737 --> 02:04:33.217]  We're good to go.
[02:04:33.237 --> 02:04:33.637]  We're good to go.
[02:04:50.592 --> 02:04:53.495]  By porting down bioweapons laboratories.
[02:04:53.515 --> 02:04:54.817]  This was admitted in mainstream news.
[02:04:55.257 --> 02:04:59.402]  Ananova, Sky News, Sunday Herald, they all reported on it.
[02:04:59.923 --> 02:05:10.895]  It got released, and the government, two months before it got released, told the different farming bureaus, prepare with mass pyres, mass wood, to burn animals.
[02:05:11.638 --> 02:05:12.439]  We're good to go.
[02:05:30.279 --> 02:05:32.980]  To say, okay, you can't restock your cows and sheep.
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:40.422]  And a year later, the head of the environmental group there at the Bureau in the British government said, you can't restock your cows and sheep.
[02:05:40.862 --> 02:05:45.843]  You can't farm anymore because the runoff of their hooves into the streams hurts the environment.
[02:05:45.863 --> 02:05:51.025]  Their flatulence causes a greenhouse effect, which is just ridiculous.
[02:05:52.513 --> 02:05:54.754]  And so we're not going to let you restock them.
[02:05:54.914 --> 02:05:57.375]  And so they're forcing people off their ancestral lands.
[02:05:57.796 --> 02:06:02.898]  It's all about getting you into compact cities where you can be totally and completely controlled.
[02:06:03.758 --> 02:06:10.761]  And then I saw a story two years ago where it was first in the Pioneer Press out of Minnesota, then we saw it in Virginia, other areas.
[02:06:11.801 --> 02:06:16.703]  They said, if foot and mouth is released, we're going to shut down all the farms and ranches, period.
[02:06:16.743 --> 02:06:18.264]  Thirty states passed laws to do it.
[02:06:19.190 --> 02:06:22.511]  The Army's going to bring food to the ranchers' and farmers' homes.
[02:06:22.932 --> 02:06:24.192]  You can't leave your house.
[02:06:24.532 --> 02:06:26.313]  And they're going to start mass culling here.
[02:06:28.054 --> 02:06:30.675]  Now, foot and mouth is no problem with range-fed cattle.
[02:06:31.035 --> 02:06:33.836]  It's the most profitable type as well because you just put them out on your land.
[02:06:33.876 --> 02:06:34.617]  They eat the grass.
[02:06:34.657 --> 02:06:39.939]  Maybe in the winter you give them some supplemental range cubes, some feeds and alfalfa.
[02:06:40.695 --> 02:06:45.237]  You put out a salt lick for them to get the key minerals if there's not natural salt licks in the area.
[02:06:45.678 --> 02:06:47.959]  It's how you pay your outrageous property taxes.
[02:06:48.499 --> 02:06:50.460]  It's how you hold on to your land.
[02:06:51.411 --> 02:06:56.534]  Believe me, you've got to be independently wealthy to own land, or it's a subsistence situation.
[02:06:57.074 --> 02:07:01.416]  We own a lot of land in East Texas, and it's a battle each year to pay the property taxes.
[02:07:01.456 --> 02:07:06.719]  We do that with deer hunting revenue and the cows, and it barely pays the bill.
[02:07:06.799 --> 02:07:10.801]  The land is frankly a liability because of the outrageous property taxes.
[02:07:11.261 --> 02:07:19.666]  If there is a foot-and-mouth outbreak or spongy form of encephalopathy or mad cow in these cows...
[02:07:20.835 --> 02:07:29.018]  If it happens, even on feedlots in Canada or Illinois or wherever, it is going to smash the beef industry for a long time.
[02:07:29.438 --> 02:07:31.179]  A lot of people aren't going to be able to hold on.
[02:07:31.199 --> 02:07:32.399]  I am very angry.
[02:07:32.419 --> 02:07:36.020]  I don't want to hear ranchers going, don't talk about this, it will hurt us.
[02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:42.122]  Not talking about it is going to kill Americans and going to make it bigger and be a bigger disaster in the future.
[02:07:42.562 --> 02:07:47.824]  We have got to talk about it and talk about how the culprits, the government allowing this, have caused this problem.
[02:07:48.792 --> 02:07:56.417]  By the way, there's a giant plant in Florida where they feed, where they grind up dead cats and dogs that have been euthanized and put it back into dog food.
[02:07:56.738 --> 02:07:59.059]  That's causing mad cow in your dogs and cats.
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:02.301]  It has got to stop, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:03.062 --> 02:08:10.187]  We've got to stop feeding rotten animals to other animals, especially herbivores, creatures that only eat plant life.
[02:08:11.261 --> 02:08:14.103]  It is so important we stop the craziness.
[02:08:14.143 --> 02:08:19.787]  But all this mad cow and all this foot and mouth released by a bioweapons lab, porting down, is nothing!
[02:08:21.668 --> 02:08:22.308]  Nothing!
[02:08:23.469 --> 02:08:24.149]  Zero!
[02:08:25.870 --> 02:08:32.675]  Not a zip compared to what we're looking at and what we're facing.
[02:08:33.809 --> 02:08:47.222]  The situation that we're dealing with, with companies like Texas company ProteGene that engineered the AIDS virus into the corn, 96 locations, FDA authorized it, it's spread into soybean crops, that's mainstream news.
[02:08:47.282 --> 02:08:50.685]  It's so insane, I feel like a liar when I say it.
[02:08:53.147 --> 02:08:58.913]  I feel like a liar when I say it, though I've got the AP report that no one ever seemed to saw, it was never in a newspaper.
[02:08:59.443 --> 02:09:01.404]  We got goats being spliced with spiders.
[02:09:01.424 --> 02:09:03.646]  We got cockroach genes going into tomatoes and corn.
[02:09:03.946 --> 02:09:05.207]  Salmon genes going into corn.
[02:09:05.587 --> 02:09:07.088]  Human genes going into pigs.
[02:09:07.188 --> 02:09:07.969]  It's nuts!
[02:09:09.249 --> 02:09:16.214]  And no wonder we've got all these bizarre flesh-eating bacteria popping up and weird SARS viruses and all these spinoffs from genetic engineering.
[02:09:16.234 --> 02:09:20.817]  If it's not on purpose, they've allowed it to happen in an insanely reckless fashion.
[02:09:21.978 --> 02:09:22.278]  I don't know.
[02:09:22.298 --> 02:09:24.399]  What do you think about genetic engineering run wild?
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:28.682]  Africa figured it out and has refused all of this so-called food aid.
[02:09:29.358 --> 02:09:31.499]  That's genetically engineered massively.
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:33.080]  What are we going to figure it out?
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:36.843]  What are we going to figure out what they're doing to us with these vaccines and all this trash?
[02:09:38.223 --> 02:09:42.266]  We've got to expose how evil and corrupt the globalist are, and we've got to do it now.
[02:09:43.254 --> 02:09:45.577]  Military on highest domestic terror threat alert.
[02:09:46.057 --> 02:09:46.338]  The U.S.
[02:09:46.358 --> 02:09:53.006]  Defense Intelligence Agency has raised its warnings of possible terror attack against military facilities in the United States to its highest level.
[02:09:53.346 --> 02:10:03.438]  Defense officials said on Wednesday, responding to the charge that the threat from significant to high, the military will deploy additional mobile anti-aircraft missile systems.
[02:10:03.798 --> 02:10:08.321]  And increased air patrols in Washington area, according to officials who asked not to be identified.
[02:10:08.341 --> 02:10:12.344]  The DIA warnings were issued late on Tuesday as the U.S.
[02:10:12.384 --> 02:10:21.890]  government raised its general terror alert status to the second highest level, citing the risk of attacks on the American soil in light of recent suicide bombings in Morocco and Saudi Arabia.
[02:10:22.491 --> 02:10:31.497]  Pentagon said it was up to regional and base commanders to decide what protective level to set for the facilities, but level remained at Charlie at the Pentagon, one below...
[02:10:32.879 --> 02:10:34.480]  We're the highest of the four levels.
[02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:44.302]  The defense official said in addition to increasing patrols by fighter jets over Washington, the military would deploy additional anti-aircraft missiles on the ground.
[02:10:44.703 --> 02:10:51.885]  They would include Avenger packages of lightweight Stinger missiles mounted on Humvee military vehicles.
[02:10:51.905 --> 02:10:53.785]  You know, they had this already in Washington.
[02:10:54.826 --> 02:10:56.486]  They already have Stingers on top of the Capitol.
[02:10:56.546 --> 02:10:59.487]  I've seen images on the news where there's a guy on the roof with a Stinger before.
[02:11:00.197 --> 02:11:00.617]  We're good to go.
[02:11:25.928 --> 02:11:27.350]  White kills more than 640 in Algeria.
[02:11:27.370 --> 02:11:28.431]  Nearly 5,000 reported injured.
[02:11:28.451 --> 02:11:29.792]  6.7 government officials say.
[02:11:35.976 --> 02:11:40.918]  Powerful earthquake that struck northern Algeria, killed at least 640 people and injured 5,000 others.
[02:11:41.278 --> 02:11:49.601]  Government said Thursday among the areas hardest hit was the city of Rabouia, or Rabouia, I pronounced that right, to the east of the capital, Algiers.
[02:11:50.121 --> 02:11:54.003]  The quake had a magnitude of 6.7 on the open, ended Richter scale.
[02:11:54.183 --> 02:11:54.383]  U.S.
[02:11:54.483 --> 02:12:01.586]  experts said the quake sent panicked families running into the streets of Algiers where buildings in some districts were damaged.
[02:12:02.890 --> 02:12:05.633]  The tremor hit a 7.44 p.m.
[02:12:05.673 --> 02:12:06.133]  Wednesday.
[02:12:07.114 --> 02:12:08.135]  It goes on and on.
[02:12:08.715 --> 02:12:14.781]  Also, Tarrytown judge remarks sparks outrage just to show the Nazi-like mentality.
[02:12:15.641 --> 02:12:19.825]  An Arab-American woman who fainted in a village court said she suffered an anxiety attack.
[02:12:19.845 --> 02:12:21.366]  The judge asked if she were a terrorist.
[02:12:21.387 --> 02:12:23.348]  You know, they're telling these folks they'll get in prison for life.
[02:12:23.368 --> 02:12:24.029]  No wonder she fainted.
[02:12:24.807 --> 02:12:33.114]  Anassa Colder has filed a complaint against Tarrytown Village Justice William Crosby with the State Commission of Judicial Conduct.
[02:12:33.695 --> 02:12:37.538]  Colder went to court on Thursday to contest a pair of parking tickets.
[02:12:37.598 --> 02:12:43.423]  As she approached the judge's table, she said Crosby considered her name and out loud and asked if she were a terrorist.
[02:12:43.803 --> 02:12:49.268]  She said she was stunned by the implication and responded with a weak, reflexive smile.
[02:12:50.909 --> 02:12:51.410]  Unbelievable.
[02:12:52.621 --> 02:13:00.652]  And now the Deputy State Attorney General in California says protesting a war will be a terrorist act because that age terrorist, that might be illegal.
[02:13:00.692 --> 02:13:03.435]  And he goes on to say terrorism isn't something violent.
[02:13:03.816 --> 02:13:06.199]  It's something that blocks commerce or stops the war.
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:08.382]  That's the liberals doing that.
[02:13:08.422 --> 02:13:09.163]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:11.693 --> 02:13:15.577]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:13:15.817 --> 02:13:21.262]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:13:21.542 --> 02:13:31.892]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:13:32.072 --> 02:13:36.416]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:13:36.596 --> 02:13:44.957]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:13:45.217 --> 02:13:51.599]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:13:51.699 --> 02:13:56.179]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:13:56.379 --> 02:14:00.600]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[02:14:06.862 --> 02:14:10.084]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:14:11.765 --> 02:14:17.629]  Some people believe a group of wealthy men control political parties, the American media, and the wealth of our nation.
[02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.770]  Is this true?
[02:14:19.330 --> 02:14:24.253]  Dr. Stanley Monteith spent 40 years studying secret societies and subversive movements.
[02:14:24.614 --> 02:14:30.397]  He lived in Africa for three years, and when he returned home, he studied the writings of the men who shaped the modern world.
[02:14:30.798 --> 02:14:32.539]  His book, Brotherhood of Darkness,
[02:14:32.779 --> 02:14:36.482]  Identify as the people who control the world and the organizations they created.
[02:14:36.723 --> 02:14:44.329]  Dr. Monteith exposes the movement behind Rhodes Scholarship, the origin of the Council on Foreign Relations, and the myths surrounding communism.
[02:14:44.650 --> 02:14:47.252]  He discusses the goal of all covert organizations.
[02:14:47.492 --> 02:14:52.356]  So if you read Brotherhood of Darkness, you will learn a secret that has been passed down through the centuries.
[02:14:52.536 --> 02:14:58.482]  When you learn this secret, you will understand what the future holds and what you must do to help preserve our nation.

[02:15:11.454 --> 02:15:15.718]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[02:15:16.159 --> 02:15:20.703]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[02:15:21.083 --> 02:15:25.948]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[02:15:26.328 --> 02:15:28.110]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[02:15:28.150 --> 02:15:29.171]  can barely be read.
[02:15:29.191 --> 02:15:30.432]  It has faded that much.
[02:15:30.772 --> 02:15:34.675]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.

[02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:38.381]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[02:17:38.421 --> 02:17:39.381]  Let's go to some calls.
[02:17:39.481 --> 02:17:40.442]  Wyatt, Maryland.
[02:17:40.502 --> 02:17:41.402]  Wyatt, you're on the air.
[02:17:41.462 --> 02:17:42.042]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:17:42.463 --> 02:17:43.103]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:17:43.323 --> 02:17:43.803]  How you doing?
[02:17:44.143 --> 02:17:44.724]  Good, good.
[02:17:45.744 --> 02:17:49.086]  Boy, there's so much to talk about, and there's so little time.
[02:17:49.657 --> 02:17:56.762]  But all I can say is the demons are loose, and they're out, and they're doing the work.
[02:17:57.442 --> 02:18:17.896]  You know, you're talking about one topic here, a local man in Baltimore area, he was having trouble with his teenagers running up, and he's a father, you know, husband, father, and he's been having an ongoing dispute between the teenagers running up and down the street with their cars, speeding up and down, because there's children at play in the area, and I don't know what...
[02:18:18.815 --> 02:18:27.938]  Remedies he sought, but what he did do is he grabbed one of them and either smacked the heck out of them or beat him up.
[02:18:28.078 --> 02:18:33.620]  Of course, he was charged with assault, but he was also charged with a terrorist act.
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:35.061]  Oh, yeah.
[02:18:35.141 --> 02:18:37.062]  They've said everything's going to be terrorism now.
[02:18:37.142 --> 02:18:39.364]  No rights under the terrorist designation.
[02:18:39.424 --> 02:18:44.448]  And you've had all your urban warfare takeovers up there in your neck of the woods.
[02:18:44.468 --> 02:18:50.213]  What about in New York where they bust in the old city worker's house with a no-knock search warrant?
[02:18:50.233 --> 02:18:51.314]  She dies of a heart attack.
[02:18:51.374 --> 02:18:52.475]  I mean, it's just out of control.
[02:18:52.495 --> 02:18:53.576]  Oh, it certainly is.
[02:18:53.976 --> 02:18:56.158]  And I was listening to your first hour.
[02:18:56.178 --> 02:18:57.179]  It wasn't broadcast.
[02:18:57.239 --> 02:19:00.782]  I turned on where I listen to at WPOC at Silver Spring.
[02:19:01.405 --> 02:19:06.987]  I was listening to C-SPAN Radio, and they've gotten a commission together, ha-ha, on 9-11.
[02:19:07.587 --> 02:19:14.410]  And it was Lee Hamilton and Governor Kaine from New Jersey.
[02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:22.593]  And one good thing is they took calls, and every caller, Alex, every caller that called in,
[02:19:23.530 --> 02:19:25.091]  They must have seen your tape.
[02:19:25.211 --> 02:19:41.024]  They must be listening to you, buddy, because everyone was bringing up topics of controversy about the activities surrounding 9-11 and that they're not coming out with the truth, and people were saying, you guys are on a council on foreign relations, and how can you be independent?
[02:19:41.564 --> 02:19:44.707]  It was absolutely terrific, and I'm sure it'll be rebroadcast
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:50.062]  Well, let me just tell the establishment this.
[02:19:50.203 --> 02:19:51.484]  They can try to shut us down.
[02:19:51.864 --> 02:19:53.266]  They can try to buy stations up.
[02:19:53.326 --> 02:19:54.828]  They can try all their little scams.
[02:19:55.408 --> 02:20:00.534]  I want the listeners, all of you, to make 100 copies of 911 The Road to Tyranny.
[02:20:00.954 --> 02:20:15.845]  And get them to sheriffs and police and talk show hosts and mayors and preachers and a large percent are waking up and getting involved and you tell them to make copies and thousands of tapes turn into millions of tapes, millions of tapes turn into hundreds of millions of tapes.
[02:20:16.225 --> 02:20:21.910]  We can do it and if we don't, the globalists are going to continue to carry out terror, to blame it on their political enemies.
[02:20:22.170 --> 02:20:26.053]  This is life or death for this country and we're going to win this fight.
[02:20:26.173 --> 02:20:27.214]  Bottom line, Wyatt.
[02:20:27.634 --> 02:20:27.854]  Right.
[02:20:28.234 --> 02:20:29.035]  One other thing, uh,
[02:20:29.948 --> 02:20:33.451]  Back about five years ago, my uncle was killed.
[02:20:33.571 --> 02:20:46.600]  He was given bad cow disease, which they called Jakob-Krutchfeld disease, which is attributed to two doctors named Jakob and Krutchfeld, who discovered brain stem encephalitis in sheep in the 20s.
[02:20:47.381 --> 02:20:55.867]  And he was a former CIA, which are never really former, but what he was doing was he was picking up information from the inside of
[02:20:57.043 --> 02:21:09.827]  Dropped off in blockers at the airport or dumpsters around, and he was picking this information up, and he was leaking it to probably like the American Free Press, which was the Spotlight, and some other activities.
[02:21:10.207 --> 02:21:18.710]  And so he went into the Veterans Hospital here in Baltimore, Maryland, for a knee operation and came out with mad cow disease.
[02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:21.211]  And he lived for about six months.
[02:21:22.004 --> 02:21:28.130]  And they wouldn't do a biopsy on him because they said it was too dangerous to find out what he had, but they did what he had.
[02:21:29.111 --> 02:21:33.114]  They misplaced all of his medical files that were hand-carried by his wife.
[02:21:33.375 --> 02:21:43.123]  Well, I've heard from a lot of people who were former CIA that when you go in for surgery, they implant this, and you have heard that from another prominent person I can't tell you about.
[02:21:43.163 --> 02:21:44.144]  That's very possible.
[02:21:44.164 --> 02:21:44.905]  That's very possible.
[02:21:45.025 --> 02:21:48.048]  Or they just gave it to him while he was in there, or it was activated.
[02:21:49.113 --> 02:22:17.208]  But they just did away with him, and it was a terrible thing, and a lot of... At the funeral, afterwards, when we went to the house, I talked to his daughters and his children, and I asked them, I said, don't be surprised if strangers, you get strange phone calls, if people from out of the way come by your place and say, hey, I was with your father in Vietnam, or blah, blah, blah, because they did not advertise the... did not put the obituary in the newspaper, and...
[02:22:17.972 --> 02:22:22.235]  Yet they had people watching their house in white vans, and they live in the country, Alex.
[02:22:22.275 --> 02:22:26.838]  They live on the eastern shore of Maryland, which is a... I mean, there's only a few... You know all your neighbors.
[02:22:27.398 --> 02:22:32.781]  And people came to their house, strangers, doctors... Well, this is what the wondrous America is about.
[02:22:32.801 --> 02:22:34.002]  We let them bring the drugs in.
[02:22:34.022 --> 02:22:34.963]  That's not enough for them.
[02:22:35.223 --> 02:22:36.944]  Now they want to put poisons in our vaccines.
[02:22:36.964 --> 02:22:37.745]  That's not enough for them.
[02:22:38.165 --> 02:22:41.067]  They just want more and more and more, and good people got to stand up.
[02:22:41.087 --> 02:22:42.347]  There's more of us than there are of them.
[02:22:42.388 --> 02:22:42.928]  Thanks, Wyatt.
[02:22:44.102 --> 02:22:48.125]  Ron in New York, Tom and others, you're up next when we get back.
[02:22:48.166 --> 02:22:56.112]  Toll free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:56.132 --> 02:22:56.612]  800-259-9231.
[02:22:57.393 --> 02:23:00.836]  We'll get you up and on the air and cover a lot of the other news.
[02:23:01.577 --> 02:23:04.679]  Be sure and visit the websites, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[02:23:05.980 --> 02:23:06.881]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.361 --> 02:23:08.983]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.903 --> 02:23:12.586]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.419 --> 02:23:21.623]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:23:22.323 --> 02:23:29.587]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... 3-44-38 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:23:29.808 --> 02:23:31.689]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:23:39.694 --> 02:23:40.214]  Don't worry.
[02:23:40.655 --> 02:23:42.175]  This show is documented.
[02:23:42.695 --> 02:23:45.457]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:45.877 --> 02:23:49.399]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:23:49.819 --> 02:23:53.861]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:23:54.041 --> 02:23:56.102]  All right, folks, going back to your calls.
[02:23:56.562 --> 02:23:58.003]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[02:23:58.063 --> 02:23:58.883]  Ron, thanks for holding.
[02:23:58.903 --> 02:23:59.623]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:23:59.643 --> 02:24:00.184]  Go ahead.
[02:24:00.464 --> 02:24:00.844]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:01.924 --> 02:24:07.087]  I just discovered something today which was reported in the magazine called First Freedom from the NRA.
[02:24:07.127 --> 02:24:09.909]  And to their credit, they did report this in the magazine, and it's shocking.
[02:24:09.949 --> 02:24:10.409]  It really is.
[02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:25.178]  The Ashcroft Justice Department has directed the FBI that they do not have to be certain that information put into the national database that is utilized before someone could go and purchase a firearm now, that instant check database.
[02:24:25.878 --> 02:24:30.921]  They have indicated to the FBI, the Justice Department has, the information doesn't even have to be accurate.
[02:24:31.963 --> 02:24:36.625]  And if it's inaccurate, there's no incumbency upon them to remove it in any timely manner.
[02:24:37.426 --> 02:24:38.286]  Well, of course not.
[02:24:38.366 --> 02:24:42.909]  People all the time who've done nothing wrong and have no criminal record can't get guns.
[02:24:42.989 --> 02:24:45.690]  And now, under the instant check, it's all under federal control.
[02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:51.213]  They're going to reauthorize Clinton's gun ban, and they're going to expand it radically.
[02:24:52.253 --> 02:24:55.575]  So they're going to add a semi-automatic shotgun ban.
[02:24:55.615 --> 02:24:56.956]  That's the NRA telling you that.
[02:24:57.857 --> 02:25:05.286]  They're going to sign S-22, which is Patriot Act 2 in the Senate, full of gun registration, shutting down the gun shows, national ballistics databases.
[02:25:05.982 --> 02:25:20.708]  The most gun control, the most hardcore draconian stuff we've ever seen, and the average conservative out there has no idea, because the neocons like Rush Limbaugh, Neil Bortz, Michael Savage, Sean Hannity, will not tell them.
[02:25:21.008 --> 02:25:22.049]  No, they won't tell them.
[02:25:22.489 --> 02:25:30.312]  I don't believe most people in this country who wave plastic flags and support this administration, and I'm going to tell you something, and I'll say it here over your airwaves.
[02:25:31.115 --> 02:25:37.481]  I don't care if I lose every friend I got doing it because I am acquainted with a lot of people who are under that delusion that this guy is a great patriot.
[02:25:38.381 --> 02:25:40.203]  This guy is not your friend.
[02:25:40.763 --> 02:25:50.191]  We've come to the point in this country where if you really love America, you're going to stop thinking in terms of Democrat and Republican and start thinking in terms of being a good American.
[02:25:50.652 --> 02:25:57.698]  Because whether it's Clinton or Bush, they might use different approaches to the problem, but neither one in the final result.
[02:25:58.251 --> 02:25:59.211]  is out for your interest.
[02:25:59.251 --> 02:26:18.274]  When you have the Justice Department under John Ashcroft, this is not Janet Reno now, this is John Ashcroft, directing the FBI to ignore the accuracy requirements of the Federal Privacy Act and telling them, just put any old information, this doesn't even have to be founded information that they're putting in these databases anymore.
[02:26:18.674 --> 02:26:27.636]  As a matter of fact, the information that goes into these databases are not even information where there's a finding of fact that maybe you were convicted of a crime which prohibits you from owning a firearm.
[02:26:28.140 --> 02:26:29.723]  In essence, rumors could filter through.
[02:26:30.344 --> 02:26:31.405]  Like in Stalin's Russia.
[02:26:31.846 --> 02:26:34.891]  A rumor could filter through and that you were finished.
[02:26:35.512 --> 02:26:38.236]  A rumor can filter through and make its way into this database.
[02:26:38.792 --> 02:26:40.954]  And you lose your right.
[02:26:41.675 --> 02:26:46.319]  When they snatch you, no one can say that you were even snatched by them or they get the terrorist label.
[02:26:46.599 --> 02:26:52.624]  Well, did you hear of this Deputy Attorney General in California in the Oakland Tribune saying you don't have to do anything violent to be a terrorist?
[02:26:52.684 --> 02:26:56.288]  Protesting a war helps the terrorists, so that's terrorism?
[02:26:56.328 --> 02:26:57.629]  I mean, it's the end of America.
[02:26:57.929 --> 02:26:58.990]  They're trying to push it.
[02:26:59.010 --> 02:27:00.151]  They're not going to get away with it.
[02:27:00.751 --> 02:27:02.793]  It's almost the Sovietizing of this country.
[02:27:02.913 --> 02:27:04.014]  It's not almost.
[02:27:04.074 --> 02:27:04.575]  It's worse.
[02:27:05.035 --> 02:27:08.976]  You're right, because they have more technical sophistication than Stalin had at his fingertips.
[02:27:08.996 --> 02:27:10.296]  They're not going to get away with it, though.
[02:27:10.316 --> 02:27:10.836]  We're armed.
[02:27:10.856 --> 02:27:11.737]  The Russians weren't.
[02:27:12.377 --> 02:27:14.657]  And we're armed with the Internet and information.
[02:27:14.677 --> 02:27:17.158]  We're armed with God's aid and support.
[02:27:17.778 --> 02:27:18.858]  We're going to stand against this.
[02:27:19.078 --> 02:27:24.780]  And as things get worse and worse, more good people are going to speak up and stand up inside the compartmentalization of the government.
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:26.500]  This whole thing runs out of ignorance.
[02:27:26.540 --> 02:27:27.840]  They count on people being ignorant.
[02:27:28.201 --> 02:27:28.741]  And that's right.
[02:27:28.781 --> 02:27:34.322]  And you're right when you say that those certain talk show hosts are going to keep people ignorant because none of them mention anything like this, yet it's going on.
[02:27:34.952 --> 02:27:40.625]  People who like to call themselves conservatives and patriotic, and there are many good average Americans who really feel that way.
[02:27:40.665 --> 02:27:42.550]  What was the nightly news headline a few weeks ago?
[02:27:42.570 --> 02:27:44.695]  Neocons call for a new world order.
[02:27:45.942 --> 02:27:47.604]  Well, they're certainly working towards it.
[02:27:47.624 --> 02:27:48.304]  This is obvious.
[02:27:48.444 --> 02:27:51.527]  You could judge them by their deeds rather than by their statements.
[02:27:52.008 --> 02:27:56.312]  And in many cases, their deeds and their statements parallel each other, and they're not good for the American people.
[02:27:56.532 --> 02:28:04.720]  Open borders, gun grabbing, blocking Dan Burton's committee, investigating Barton Gate, all the supercomputers of communist China, campaign finance reform...
[02:28:06.041 --> 02:28:20.394]  Loading the size of the Department of Education, BATF, creating the new biggest federal bureaucracy ever seen, Homeland Security, trying to federalize the cities, EAS FEMA takeover system, and camouflages the Amber Alert, the total package of slavery.
[02:28:21.034 --> 02:28:22.095]  And you know what, Alex?
[02:28:22.336 --> 02:28:26.439]  When are good average people that consider themselves Republicans conservative?
[02:28:26.459 --> 02:28:27.360]  You know what I'm talking about.
[02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:28.021]  You know the type.
[02:28:28.301 --> 02:28:30.363]  We probably come out of that same background, you and I.
[02:28:30.851 --> 02:28:34.093]  When are they going to wake up and realize that this guy is a fraudulent item?
[02:28:34.393 --> 02:28:37.375]  Well, I mean, George Bush is as big a puppet or bigger than Bill Clinton.
[02:28:37.415 --> 02:28:38.496]  He's not running anything.
[02:28:38.776 --> 02:28:39.737]  He's a titular head.
[02:28:39.757 --> 02:28:42.258]  When we get too focused on that, it gets into the left-right debate.
[02:28:42.559 --> 02:28:45.140]  The left's controlled, the right's controlled, and the establishment.
[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:55.487]  We've got to telegraph that to the people and get them focused on the real issues of how the President and his Treasury Secretary Snow are bad-mouthing the dollar that's killing our stock market.
[02:28:55.787 --> 02:28:59.429]  All we had left was that fiat currency to buy the cheap slave goods.
[02:28:59.469 --> 02:29:00.170]  This is horrible.
[02:29:00.410 --> 02:29:01.951]  It is not good for manufacturing.
[02:29:02.211 --> 02:29:02.652]  And it's true.
[02:29:02.692 --> 02:29:09.237]  When are people going to get out of that left-right debate, that Democrat-Republican debate, and realize that we're at a more important crossroad now?
[02:29:09.257 --> 02:29:13.400]  There's a difference in the rhetoric with the Republicans and Democrats, but not in their actions.
[02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:14.281]  Thanks for your call.
[02:29:15.602 --> 02:29:16.603]  I appreciate it, Ron.
[02:29:17.464 --> 02:29:18.865]  Let's talk to Tom in Texas.
[02:29:18.905 --> 02:29:19.465]  You're on the air.
[02:29:19.525 --> 02:29:20.166]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:29:21.487 --> 02:29:21.687]  Yeah.
[02:29:22.027 --> 02:29:22.788]  Yes, sir.
[02:29:23.308 --> 02:29:23.829]  You're on the air.
[02:29:23.849 --> 02:29:24.269]  Go ahead.
[02:29:24.549 --> 02:29:25.270]  Yes, sir.
[02:29:25.490 --> 02:29:27.532]  Alex, I was the one that first informed...
[02:29:29.204 --> 02:29:40.753]  Sir, I really don't understand what you're saying.
[02:29:40.773 --> 02:29:44.635]  You're going to have to give us some background.
[02:29:44.655 --> 02:29:49.799]  Okay, the background is I went to this church that we moved pews out of.
[02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:53.322]  And the old man walked out cussing like a sailor because we got there late.
[02:29:53.762 --> 02:29:55.984]  He said, you realize whose church this is?
[02:29:56.044 --> 02:29:56.444]  I said, no.
[02:29:57.338 --> 02:29:59.219]  He says, this is George Bush's church.
[02:29:59.239 --> 02:30:01.721]  Well, we walked in and it had a big swastika hanging down.
[02:30:02.921 --> 02:30:04.202]  And up above the pulpit.
[02:30:05.863 --> 02:30:07.184]  And so I said, well, okay.
[02:30:07.224 --> 02:30:07.984]  Well, tell me all about it.
[02:30:08.004 --> 02:30:09.625]  He has the Christian symbol up there, he said.
[02:30:10.486 --> 02:30:13.668]  And he showed me all the pictures in the offices of the Bush family.
[02:30:15.029 --> 02:30:17.950]  So about, I guess, two weeks later, I went and told Tex Mars about it.
[02:30:19.011 --> 02:30:19.611]  At a convention.
[02:30:20.812 --> 02:30:21.673]  At the Hobby Airport.
[02:30:23.234 --> 02:30:24.915]  And I was told...
[02:30:26.765 --> 02:30:40.295]  My granddaddy told me before he died in 77 that he was in World War I. Before he died, he said, it's not the communists to worry about, it's the Nazis who've infiltrated our government.
[02:30:40.316 --> 02:30:51.224]  Let me stop you, sir, because MSNBC and USA Today admit that they have swastikas and they eat off Hitler's plates at the Skull and Bones at Yale.
[02:30:51.264 --> 02:30:51.444]  Right.
[02:30:52.179 --> 02:31:03.925]  And that's mainstream news, and that, oh, they're just having fun, and yes, the Germans found it in 1832 at Yale, the takeover, and we know Prescott Bush was briefly arrested for trading with the enemy and paid the largest fine in U.S.
[02:31:03.945 --> 02:31:07.706]  history for running 53% of Nazi steel production through Brown Brother Harriman.
[02:31:08.067 --> 02:31:12.208]  I have those mainstream news articles in the new film, Police State Three Total Enslavement.
[02:31:12.228 --> 02:31:13.169]  They're also on the website.
[02:31:13.189 --> 02:31:14.129]  We had more on it this week.
[02:31:14.530 --> 02:31:17.491]  There's the unauthorized biography by Tarpley that writes about it.
[02:31:17.891 --> 02:31:18.912]  I'm aware of all that.
[02:31:18.952 --> 02:31:21.753]  You're saying here in Texas, that was a church.
[02:31:21.793 --> 02:31:23.173]  You went into it.
[02:31:23.234 --> 02:31:25.034]  Tell me where this is and what you saw.
[02:31:25.354 --> 02:31:25.755]  Okay.
[02:31:26.715 --> 02:31:26.915]  It was 1988.
[02:31:26.955 --> 02:31:30.557]  I was working for U-Haul Movers World for a little short job.
[02:31:31.457 --> 02:31:34.278]  And there was about a nine-truck convoy.
[02:31:34.339 --> 02:31:38.600]  We were to go out on this long road.
[02:31:39.501 --> 02:31:41.762]  We drove and drove and drove and finally found a place.
[02:31:41.822 --> 02:31:46.404]  It didn't have much of an address, but it had Arianism, kind of a rusted old sign waving back and forth.
[02:31:47.802 --> 02:31:51.303]  And an old man comes walking out wearing a blankety-blankety old band, you know.
[02:31:51.343 --> 02:31:53.203]  So we go, and he opens the big old door.
[02:31:54.163 --> 02:31:58.984]  And, I mean, just as big as, it's like a 20 by 30.
[02:32:00.605 --> 02:32:02.025]  Can't help but see it when you walk in the door.
[02:32:02.085 --> 02:32:06.846]  And this is a gigantic cathedral-type church on the inside, just like 100 foot high.
[02:32:07.466 --> 02:32:08.787]  And this flag hangs down.
[02:32:09.307 --> 02:32:15.568]  It's blue-filled with white swastika with a small red cross at the bottom of it, all in one big piece of material.
[02:32:16.584 --> 02:32:17.985]  And then on the left side was a U.S.
[02:32:18.025 --> 02:32:25.948]  flag, and on the right side of the building, or inside the building, next to where it's hanging down, is the Lone Star flag.
[02:32:27.189 --> 02:32:35.333]  And he proceeded to carry me on through the rest of the building, and he showed me all the pictures of the Bush family and everything.
[02:32:36.193 --> 02:32:40.275]  And I was shocked, and I said, well, I acted real ignorant about it.
[02:32:40.295 --> 02:32:44.337]  He just walked away just like he was really interested in it.
[02:32:45.658 --> 02:32:47.759]  Now, where is this church, sir?
[02:32:49.679 --> 02:32:50.960]  That was the problem.
[02:32:50.980 --> 02:32:54.921]  When I told Tex Morris, he wrote about me in his book, hidden under the rainbow.
[02:32:55.661 --> 02:32:56.862]  I'm the one that informed him about it.
[02:32:56.882 --> 02:32:57.822]  He didn't know nothing about it.
[02:32:58.982 --> 02:33:00.143]  And he found it to be true.
[02:33:00.823 --> 02:33:02.724]  Okay, where is this church, sir?
[02:33:03.124 --> 02:33:04.624]  Okay, it was on Highway 6.
[02:33:05.184 --> 02:33:06.505]  Best I can remember, this is an 88.
[02:33:06.665 --> 02:33:08.565]  I'll have to do some more investigation.
[02:33:08.746 --> 02:33:09.526]  Outside where?
[02:33:10.986 --> 02:33:11.546]  Right outside.
[02:33:11.606 --> 02:33:11.907]  It's close to...
[02:33:14.241 --> 02:33:16.243]  I say going out past Sugar Land.
[02:33:17.284 --> 02:33:18.745]  Outside Houston.
[02:33:19.326 --> 02:33:19.606]  Right.
[02:33:19.626 --> 02:33:20.687]  It's on the east side of Houston.
[02:33:21.127 --> 02:33:22.208]  I mean, west side of Houston.
[02:33:23.450 --> 02:33:23.730]  Sorry.
[02:33:24.110 --> 02:33:24.951]  West side of Houston.
[02:33:25.952 --> 02:33:26.833]  It was hard to find.
[02:33:26.893 --> 02:33:31.577]  I mean, it was... But we found... You know, that was the problem.
[02:33:31.597 --> 02:33:34.920]  But what I did, I kept the address.
[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:38.964]  I kept the bill of lading of the place, which is not...
[02:33:39.597 --> 02:33:42.218]  Or it's legal, but I did, and I recopied it and sent it back to the office.
[02:33:42.238 --> 02:33:44.159]  But I took the copy and gave it to Tex Morris.
[02:33:44.219 --> 02:33:46.621]  He found it, to be true, what I had found.
[02:33:46.801 --> 02:33:48.141]  No, I remember reading about that.
[02:33:48.181 --> 02:33:48.902]  It's years ago.
[02:33:48.922 --> 02:33:50.082]  I'd have to dig it back out.
[02:33:50.763 --> 02:33:52.804]  But anyway... I'm trying to go back to memory.
[02:33:52.844 --> 02:33:53.684]  I know there's something about that.
[02:33:53.924 --> 02:33:56.005]  I really don't want to talk about this, sir, without evidence.
[02:33:56.045 --> 02:33:56.906]  I don't know this to be true.
[02:33:56.926 --> 02:33:57.566]  Right, I understand that.
[02:33:57.586 --> 02:33:58.066]  Yeah, it's true.
[02:33:58.527 --> 02:34:03.569]  I know that the tomb has a little church in it with a swastika, and they do that.
[02:34:03.609 --> 02:34:06.050]  But I didn't know about what you were mentioning.
[02:34:06.531 --> 02:34:07.951]  Yeah, and I wish I had more on it, but...
[02:34:09.793 --> 02:34:14.235]  But it really did happen to me, and I really saw this.
[02:34:15.415 --> 02:34:17.416]  But, you know, I was just more or less.
[02:34:18.317 --> 02:34:20.458]  Also, I was going to tell you.
[02:34:20.518 --> 02:34:22.739]  Were there stained glass windows in this church?
[02:34:26.100 --> 02:34:27.821]  You know, it was top of a metal.
[02:34:28.181 --> 02:34:28.941]  It had a metal.
[02:34:29.802 --> 02:34:31.302]  The outside skin of it was metal.
[02:34:32.243 --> 02:34:32.983]  I do remember that.
[02:34:34.341 --> 02:34:38.062]  It was very tall, you know, ceiling-wise, up to the, you know, ceiling.
[02:34:38.082 --> 02:34:38.742]  But I don't remember.
[02:34:38.762 --> 02:34:39.882]  It was very dark, too.
[02:34:39.902 --> 02:34:44.083]  It didn't look like there was much lighting in it.
[02:34:44.163 --> 02:34:46.344]  Why were you moving pews out of it?
[02:34:46.964 --> 02:34:54.826]  All right, what they were doing was moving, they were taking the pews out and putting it into a more modern-looking building.
[02:34:54.906 --> 02:34:57.126]  How many people would you say the church would seat?
[02:34:58.006 --> 02:35:01.067]  It was probably at least 800 at the least.
[02:35:03.090 --> 02:35:04.951]  And it was real organized looking.
[02:35:05.011 --> 02:35:09.453]  I mean, in the office area, I mean, the whole family was in there.
[02:35:10.894 --> 02:35:13.595]  They had the Bushes, the kids, the whole nine yards in there.
[02:35:14.536 --> 02:35:17.797]  I said, well, I can't believe this is Bushes.
[02:35:17.817 --> 02:35:22.300]  He said, man, this is the true church of God here.
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:24.481]  He said it was a branch from the Episcopalian.
[02:35:25.901 --> 02:35:27.002]  I do remember him saying that.
[02:35:28.142 --> 02:35:34.028]  Sir, I appreciate your call, Tom.
[02:35:34.048 --> 02:35:34.809]  I appreciate it.
[02:35:34.869 --> 02:35:38.152]  But look, that is not how I know the Global is to operate.
[02:35:38.933 --> 02:35:42.936]  It's an armored fortress at the Skull and Bones tomb, and that kind of stuff is in there.
[02:35:42.956 --> 02:35:43.657]  That's confirmed.
[02:35:44.638 --> 02:35:47.701]  It's guarded at Bohemian Grove, and there is that type of stuff.
[02:35:49.222 --> 02:35:50.544]  I don't know that story, sir.
[02:35:50.624 --> 02:35:52.385]  I really don't like to speculate.
[02:35:52.746 --> 02:35:52.906]  So...
[02:35:55.247 --> 02:35:56.227]  I'm not saying you're a liar.
[02:35:56.347 --> 02:35:57.968]  It just doesn't fit.
[02:35:58.608 --> 02:36:00.629]  It fits with some stuff, but not in other areas.
[02:36:01.029 --> 02:36:02.129]  Gary in Ohio.
[02:36:02.189 --> 02:36:03.109]  Gary, you're on the air.
[02:36:03.169 --> 02:36:03.589]  Go ahead.
[02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.610]  Hi, Alex.
[02:36:04.650 --> 02:36:05.190]  How are you doing?
[02:36:05.210 --> 02:36:05.890]  Pretty good, sir.
[02:36:06.330 --> 02:36:07.851]  Hey, I really enjoyed the interview.
[02:36:07.891 --> 02:36:12.292]  I'm going to have to record that tonight and do a transcript for you.
[02:36:12.332 --> 02:36:13.252]  That was a great interview.
[02:36:13.272 --> 02:36:14.132]  I went to the website.
[02:36:14.152 --> 02:36:14.993]  It was fantastic.
[02:36:17.053 --> 02:36:21.014]  One thing I wanted to mention real quick is I... Gary, are you the guy that's done some of the transcripts for us?
[02:36:21.274 --> 02:36:21.594]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:21.774 --> 02:36:23.115]  Well, I really appreciate that help.
[02:36:24.013 --> 02:36:25.953]  Were you the guy that did the Greg Paulus interview?
[02:36:27.094 --> 02:36:27.714]  I think I did.
[02:36:27.894 --> 02:36:29.994]  Well, that was published in hundreds of newspapers.
[02:36:30.194 --> 02:36:31.015]  Oh, no, that wasn't me.
[02:36:31.035 --> 02:36:31.675]  That wasn't me.
[02:36:32.015 --> 02:36:32.895]  That was a lady, yeah.
[02:36:32.915 --> 02:36:35.495]  But I just want to thank everybody that transcribes interviews.
[02:36:35.515 --> 02:36:36.096]  It's really great.
[02:36:36.356 --> 02:36:38.256]  Hey, that's no problem, Alex.
[02:36:38.396 --> 02:36:39.716]  It's just part of the job.
[02:36:40.897 --> 02:36:44.417]  Also, I'm working on a poster to help get the word out.
[02:36:44.457 --> 02:36:47.318]  But what I want to mention is I finally did find a job.
[02:36:48.738 --> 02:36:50.539]  I work for a retail store.
[02:36:50.579 --> 02:36:52.019]  I would rather not mention the name.
[02:36:52.628 --> 02:36:55.451]  But they have something that kind of goes along with something you've been talking about.
[02:36:55.491 --> 02:36:57.313]  You were going about the thumb scanning and all that.
[02:36:57.613 --> 02:36:57.934]  Yes.
[02:36:58.695 --> 02:37:04.321]  We have a policy that if someone writes a check for over a certain dollar amount... They make you do an ink print.
[02:37:04.881 --> 02:37:06.042]  Yes, that white ink.
[02:37:06.703 --> 02:37:11.188]  And that's to prepare people to go into the biometrics next, which they're now doing.
[02:37:11.906 --> 02:37:13.026]  It's just a matter of time.
[02:37:13.046 --> 02:37:17.648]  I've heard you talk about pulling out the cashier, regular lanes, and putting in these.
[02:37:18.028 --> 02:37:19.949]  And our store has a bunch of the self-check lanes.
[02:37:19.989 --> 02:37:22.849]  They haven't gotten to the biometrics yet, but it's only a matter of time.
[02:37:22.869 --> 02:37:25.370]  First they make you self-check and put stickers on your produce.
[02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:30.892]  Then they put in the self-checkout lanes at Home Depot, HEB, wherever, your grocery store, your store.
[02:37:31.352 --> 02:37:34.433]  Then they put in thumb scanners into those self-serve lanes.
[02:37:34.773 --> 02:37:37.254]  Then they pull out the final lanes and make you do it.
[02:37:37.854 --> 02:37:38.734]  It's all progressive.
[02:37:40.155 --> 02:37:40.855]  Incrementalism.
[02:37:41.583 --> 02:37:41.943]  Thank you.
[02:37:43.044 --> 02:37:50.987]  But I just want to mention real quick, if I can possibly get that recorded tonight, I'll record it and pop that into the email for you, okay?
[02:37:51.547 --> 02:37:51.867]  All right.
[02:37:51.907 --> 02:37:52.607]  God bless you, sir.
[02:37:52.647 --> 02:37:54.008]  I appreciate everything you do, Gary.
[02:37:55.348 --> 02:37:57.029]  I really do appreciate everybody.
[02:37:57.369 --> 02:38:01.950]  I have tried my best to do the most honest job I can on this show.
[02:38:02.451 --> 02:38:05.892]  I've tried my best to tell the truth, to not compromise.
[02:38:06.796 --> 02:38:09.078]  I have tried to give out the most accurate information.
[02:38:09.098 --> 02:38:11.720]  I have researched the globalists, and I am bowled over.
[02:38:12.321 --> 02:38:18.145]  I am stunned by the complete wickedness and out-of-control, sadistic, control freak nature of these individuals.
[02:38:18.225 --> 02:38:22.509]  And my very humanity cries out to resist this and stand up against it.
[02:38:22.869 --> 02:38:24.931]  And frankly, it's for the globalists' own good as well.
[02:38:25.091 --> 02:38:26.272]  I mean, not just for the general public.
[02:38:26.732 --> 02:38:29.515]  These guys don't know how to stop, when to stop.
[02:38:29.575 --> 02:38:30.315]  They want it all.
[02:38:30.415 --> 02:38:31.156]  They want it now.
[02:38:31.296 --> 02:38:35.980]  Thugs always get total control and go over the edge and blow out their own systems.
[02:38:37.398 --> 02:38:41.741]  And that is clearly happening again here in America.
[02:38:44.083 --> 02:38:47.425]  People in these ivory towers always get power sickness.
[02:38:48.066 --> 02:38:49.947]  They get power mad, power drunk.
[02:38:49.987 --> 02:38:50.727]  They flip out.
[02:38:51.548 --> 02:38:52.529]  And it's happening again.
[02:38:52.549 --> 02:38:55.431]  They're using scientific systems of mind control on a mass scale.
[02:38:56.331 --> 02:39:04.317]  And I'd beg everyone to realize what we're facing as a society and to realize that we have these organized crime syndicates allied together bringing you this new world order.
[02:39:05.587 --> 02:39:06.707]  They want to dumb you down.
[02:39:06.747 --> 02:39:08.168]  They want to destroy creativity.
[02:39:08.188 --> 02:39:09.428]  They want to destroy the family.
[02:39:09.448 --> 02:39:13.090]  They want to sterilize us with their vaccines and cause brain damage in our children.
[02:39:13.530 --> 02:39:14.470]  They want control.
[02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:15.390]  They want it all.
[02:39:15.570 --> 02:39:16.331]  They want it now.
[02:39:16.791 --> 02:39:21.552]  Their sick argument is, well, if we don't do it, some other elite will rise and do it.
[02:39:21.612 --> 02:39:26.634]  We're the great architects, and we know best, and we've molded history, and we're going to do what we want.
[02:39:28.783 --> 02:39:34.028]  We've got to have the courage to resist the New World Order, and you've got to spread the word about this show and other shows that tell the truth.
[02:39:34.068 --> 02:39:40.633]  You can always listen at Infowars.com, at Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:39:41.514 --> 02:39:42.695]  You can always join us.
[02:39:43.459 --> 02:39:44.640]  Here, you can always listen.
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:48.784]  You can always listen on Global Shortwave during the day from 11 a.m.
[02:39:48.824 --> 02:39:49.584]  until 2 p.m.
[02:39:49.945 --> 02:39:56.991]  Central on the shortwave at 12172 and 9320 and at 9, 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 6890.
[02:39:58.372 --> 02:39:59.693]  Please tell your friends and family.
[02:39:59.753 --> 02:40:00.494]  Tell them to tune in.
[02:40:00.514 --> 02:40:01.355]  Tell them to hear the truth.
[02:40:01.715 --> 02:40:11.123]  Tell them to understand that history is about thugs wanting more power and how we've been engineered psychologically to reject that historical fact.
[02:40:12.202 --> 02:40:13.323]  Now is the time.
[02:40:24.258 --> 02:40:35.810]  To educate ourselves about history and about the Bill of Rights and Constitution and to look at the real record of the neocons, which is to bloat the government, butcher the Bill of Rights, militarize the police, build giant prisons.
[02:40:36.270 --> 02:40:38.673]  The number one part of our economy now is prisons.
[02:40:39.233 --> 02:40:40.415]  It's not manufacturing.
[02:40:40.455 --> 02:40:43.818]  The other biggest part of the economy is surveillance and security.
[02:40:44.759 --> 02:40:47.502]  It is a hellish world the globalists are building.
[02:40:48.343 --> 02:40:50.564]  And now is the time to get the word out.
[02:40:50.644 --> 02:40:52.484]  Now is the time to resist the New World Order.
[02:40:52.884 --> 02:40:54.365]  Now is the time to tell the truth.
[02:40:54.765 --> 02:40:56.705]  Now is the time to stand up for our families.
[02:40:57.125 --> 02:40:58.066]  We've got to do it.
[02:40:58.346 --> 02:41:01.246]  They're breeding us like cattle, dumbing us down like cattle.
[02:41:01.907 --> 02:41:05.267]  It is so sickening to watch these criminals get away with it day after day.
[02:41:05.608 --> 02:41:07.068]  They must be brought to justice.
[02:41:07.588 --> 02:41:12.169]  Our level of tolerance is being raised to accept higher and higher levels of insane corruption.
[02:41:12.189 --> 02:41:14.530]  A trillion dollars missing from the Pentagon.
[02:41:17.109 --> 02:41:18.430]  Seven, now $9 billion.
[02:41:18.470 --> 02:41:19.711]  No bids allowed.
[02:41:19.771 --> 02:41:21.011]  Contracts for Halliburton.
[02:41:21.031 --> 02:41:21.792]  It goes on and on.
[02:41:21.812 --> 02:41:23.453]  I've got a bunch of final news I'm going to hit.
[02:41:24.473 --> 02:41:27.715]  On the other side, allies to begin seizing weapons from most Iraqis.
[02:41:28.435 --> 02:41:29.916]  And much more on the other side.
[02:41:30.697 --> 02:41:34.939]  And I'll tell you how to support the broadcast by getting my documentary films and making copies and spreading the word.
[02:41:37.486 --> 02:41:44.874]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:45.135 --> 02:41:49.880]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:55.747]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.987 --> 02:41:56.728]  The Alex Jones Show!
[02:42:12.610 --> 02:42:15.131]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[02:42:15.351 --> 02:42:22.093]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:42:22.293 --> 02:42:27.555]  Order online now at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[02:42:36.323 --> 02:42:39.786]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:42:40.066 --> 02:42:43.569]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:42:43.649 --> 02:42:47.592]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:42:47.812 --> 02:42:53.977]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.397 --> 02:43:02.303]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:43:02.723 --> 02:43:08.045]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:43:08.205 --> 02:43:11.966]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:43:12.347 --> 02:43:14.187]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:43:14.267 --> 02:43:16.448]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:43:16.668 --> 02:43:21.930]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91, or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:43:21.970 --> 02:43:27.192]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:43:30.593 --> 02:43:32.294]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:43:32.414 --> 02:43:34.456]  Protect your family.
[02:43:36.617 --> 02:43:42.560]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:43:42.781 --> 02:43:45.042]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[02:44:07.472 --> 02:44:07.993]  We're good to go.
[02:44:08.013 --> 02:44:08.313]  I think?
[02:44:38.022 --> 02:44:43.185]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:43.845 --> 02:44:46.187]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:44:46.207 --> 02:44:53.471]  All right, folks, final segment.
[02:44:53.531 --> 02:44:54.652]  Some other key news here.
[02:44:55.749 --> 02:44:58.310]  Allies to begin seizing weapons from most Iraqis.
[02:44:58.330 --> 02:45:06.152]  Iraqi citizens will be required to turn over automatic weapons and heavy weapons under a proclamation that allied authorities plan to issue this week.
[02:45:06.232 --> 02:45:18.296]  Allied officials said today the aim of the proclamation is to help stabilize Iraq by confiscating a huge supply of AK-47 machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, and other weapons that are used by criminal gangs, paramilitary groups, and remnants of the Saddam Hussein's government.
[02:45:19.296 --> 02:45:24.558]  Well, the remnants of Saddam Hussein's government, we've got the names of bad parties being put back into control.
[02:45:26.314 --> 02:45:26.894]  We're good to go.
[02:45:56.408 --> 02:45:59.510]  Big story about two paths of Bayer drugs in the 1980s.
[02:45:59.530 --> 02:46:00.950]  A riskier type went overseas.
[02:46:00.990 --> 02:46:14.797]  New York Times, a division of a pharmacological company, Bayer sold millions of dollars of blood clotting medicine for hemophiliacs medicine that carried a high risk of transmitting AIDS to Asia and Latin America in the mid-80s while selling new safer products in the West, according to documents obtained.
[02:46:15.317 --> 02:46:16.118]  We're good to go.
[02:46:16.138 --> 02:46:16.718]  We're good to go.
[02:46:43.979 --> 02:46:47.320]  But you'll trust this government to put vaccines into your body, folks.
[02:46:48.461 --> 02:46:51.321]  Come on, you need to think a little bit harder about that.
[02:46:51.482 --> 02:46:55.903]  A SARS outbreak could flare this winter, experts warn.
[02:46:56.323 --> 02:47:01.885]  One of the nation's leading infectious disease experts warned yesterday that we have not begun to see the worth of the SARS epidemic.
[02:47:02.725 --> 02:47:06.347]  A bleak forecast reluctantly endorsed by the Bush administration's top two positions.
[02:47:06.868 --> 02:47:20.956]  Though it may seem that the SARS storm is quieting, particularly in North America, Michael T. Orsterholm, chairman of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, University of Minnesota, said it is increasingly likely disease will reemerge with a vengeance next winter, only six months away.
[02:47:22.797 --> 02:47:32.223]  I am convinced that with the advent of the early winter in the northern hemisphere in the next six months, we will see a resurgence of SARS that could far exceed our experience to date.
[02:47:33.425 --> 02:47:34.745]  Very serious information.
[02:47:34.785 --> 02:47:40.226]  Before I end this segment, I have produced nine documentary films.
[02:47:40.266 --> 02:47:42.307]  This is how I fund what I do here.
[02:47:42.327 --> 02:47:45.267]  And you are authorized to make copies of my videos.
[02:47:46.688 --> 02:47:51.609]  If you haven't ordered any of my nine films or my book, Ascent into Tyranny, I don't know why you haven't.
[02:47:51.629 --> 02:47:52.429]  You really need to.
[02:47:52.449 --> 02:47:55.889]  I authorize you to make copies of it to get it out and effect change in America.
[02:47:56.210 --> 02:47:58.290]  We desperately must get this job done.
[02:47:59.628 --> 02:48:05.333]  The new film is Police State 3 Total Enslavement, two hours and 37 minutes long, $25.95.
[02:48:05.513 --> 02:48:08.636]  Order three or more of any of my nine videos.
[02:48:08.656 --> 02:48:10.037]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[02:48:10.377 --> 02:48:10.758]  The book is $12.
[02:48:11.018 --> 02:48:14.401]  911 Descent into Tyranny is a great book.
[02:48:14.601 --> 02:48:16.002]  911 Road to Tyranny is an amazing film.
[02:48:16.323 --> 02:48:18.925]  So is The Masters of Terror, and so is Police State 3.
[02:48:19.325 --> 02:48:20.186]  They're all excellent.
[02:48:20.266 --> 02:48:21.367]  I hope you'll make the call.
[02:48:21.747 --> 02:48:22.528]  Get the films.
[02:48:22.568 --> 02:48:23.329]  Get past any...
[02:48:23.829 --> 02:48:26.851]  Prepedation and fear and realize that fighting this is the way to go.
[02:48:27.191 --> 02:48:31.893]  Having honor, being part of history on the side of good is the way to go to ask God for guidance.
[02:48:32.814 --> 02:48:34.414]  I pray that God will guide all of us.
[02:48:35.075 --> 02:48:36.415]  The toll-free number to order is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:48:36.436 --> 02:48:37.676]  That's 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or net.
[02:48:51.761 --> 02:48:52.321]  We're good to go.
[02:48:52.341 --> 02:48:52.501]  I think?
[02:49:15.570 --> 02:49:23.620]  Pray for President Bush, that he'd turn away from the dark side, the New World Order, and pray for this broadcast, we reach more people, and may God lead us, guide us, and direct us.
[02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:25.542]  See you back tonight, 9 to bed, back tomorrow.
[02:49:26.704 --> 02:49:28.506]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:49:28.666 --> 02:49:34.313]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:49:34.653 --> 02:49:35.494]  Probably never, right?
[02:49:35.775 --> 02:49:37.237]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here.
