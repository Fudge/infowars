[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.841]  This is the Dennis' Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.203 --> 00:00:15.863]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.523 --> 00:00:17.603]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.424]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:20.924]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:22.505]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:27.006]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:31.427]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:36.232]  All right, folks.
[00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:40.574]  It's another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:45.916]  It's already Wednesday, the 24th of September, 2003.
[00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:48.538]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.578 --> 00:00:52.920]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central and then back from 9 to midnight.
[00:00:54.497 --> 00:00:59.781]  And I'm going to do a little bit better job at getting to the callers, taking more calls, and letting folks put their info out.
[00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:01.262]  And we're going to do that again today.
[00:01:01.422 --> 00:01:02.403]  Wide open phones.
[00:01:02.543 --> 00:01:23.358]  Any news item we don't cover, any issue I mention that you'd like to elaborate on, propaganda you've seen in the news or in the sitcoms or the cartoons with the real brainwashings going on, any type of police state developments in your area that you've seen in the news or witnessed with your own two eyes or experienced,
[00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:29.395]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:36.560]  Now, rarely do I start a show and not know where to begin.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.882]  I mean, we've got the plunging dollar.
[00:01:38.942 --> 00:01:43.665]  We've got Ashcroft running around lying about the Patriot Act.
[00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:53.372]  We've got Bush giving his speech to the UN as part of this staged event, posing and trying to make it look like the UN's the good guy in all this.
[00:01:55.618 --> 00:01:56.479]  We're good to go.
[00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.880]  I think?
[00:02:13.684 --> 00:02:27.977]  Most little talk shows that are on one station have some control freak, whether it's a liberal show or a conservative show, screening out callers that don't agree with the host or callers that are coherent and have a real point to make.
[00:02:29.498 --> 00:02:31.040]  We don't do that on this show.
[00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.473]  In fact, if you disagree with me, I may yell at you and generally apologize about it before the call is over.
[00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:43.837]  I may be friendly with you, but the point is we don't censor you on this show.
[00:02:43.877 --> 00:02:46.319]  And I want to talk to a lot of first-time callers today.
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.962]  That doesn't say that if you're not a first-time caller that you can't call.
[00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:57.917]  But I do want to talk to a lot of first-time callers today, so the total free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:00.198 --> 00:03:01.839]  What did you make of Bush's speech?
[00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.582]  I actually had a chance last night to watch about five minutes of it.
[00:03:06.982 --> 00:03:08.063]  I didn't watch the whole thing.
[00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:13.286]  It was a rebroadcast on C-SPAN, and it was disgusting.
[00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:17.969]  But we need to go over the whole point of this speech.
[00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.291]  If they wanted to find weapons of mass destruction, they would have found them.
[00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:27.661]  I mean, you don't think they've been caught about a dozen lies about weapons of mass destruction by accident.
[00:03:28.102 --> 00:03:31.805]  You don't think they really are putting out that shoddy of propaganda.
[00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:36.930]  You don't think this spectacle of lying and evil that is this Republican Party...
[00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.871]  It's being done by accident.
[00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:52.100]  This is to destroy conservatism once and for all and energize a giant left-wing movement to bring us into the New World Order, to bring us to the altar of the United Nations.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.742]  And you notice, every time Bush speaks at the UN, he wears a blue tie.
[00:03:56.963 --> 00:03:59.505]  There's a communication in all of this.
[00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:02.787]  Now, that's just admitted in corporate circles.
[00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.589]  You know, the red tie is the power tie.
[00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.491]  The red tie shows solidarity.
[00:04:09.156 --> 00:04:10.437]  I think we're good to go.
[00:04:26.986 --> 00:04:34.029]  Well, Bush is always wearing a blue tie, and everybody I saw on the stage was wearing a blue tie, showing solidarity.
[00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:38.350]  All these different delegates from different countries, the blue tie, the blue tie.
[00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.873]  Here's a photo by the Associated Press of Bush and Adnan with their baby blue ties, showing that, hey, we're on the same team.
[00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:48.354]  This is a staged event.
[00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.575]  But I don't have to just look at their ties.
[00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:52.816]  It's their actions, and I'll elaborate on that.
[00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.977]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, I told you there were the porno pictures.
[00:04:56.829 --> 00:05:05.695]  Turns out that a member of the SECO that got all the national arts funding for, well, turns out he's got a special collection of Arnie.
[00:05:06.135 --> 00:05:07.076]  We'll talk about that, too.
[00:05:07.136 --> 00:05:07.556]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:10.844]  Oh my God!
[00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:15.827]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:05:16.128 --> 00:05:16.788]  Yes, it's true.
[00:05:16.868 --> 00:05:19.570]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.733]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:24.414]  You heard it right.
[00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:29.578]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:05:29.718 --> 00:05:30.539]  You may miss out for
[00:05:48.156 --> 00:05:52.418]  To participate in this limited time offer and have your drugs prescribed over the phone for free, you need to call 1-800-615-7094 now.
[00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:56.020]  That's 1-800-615-7094 for drugs like Phentermine, Ambien, Fioriset, Sama, Ultram, Viagra, and many more.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.641]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[00:05:57.661 --> 00:05:58.362]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[00:05:58.402 --> 00:06:01.743]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:15.723]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:06:15.923 --> 00:06:21.690]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:27.217]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:06:27.498 --> 00:06:31.603]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:33.664]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:06:33.724 --> 00:06:35.565]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:51.273]  Order 911 The Road to Tyrion today.
[00:06:51.353 --> 00:06:54.735]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.001]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:06.742]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:06.923 --> 00:07:08.984]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:07:09.702 --> 00:07:10.403]  Hello, folks.
[00:07:10.423 --> 00:07:17.268]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[00:07:17.508 --> 00:07:24.653]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:07:24.773 --> 00:07:36.282]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:07:36.602 --> 00:07:37.403]  We're good to go.
[00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:15.267]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:17.008]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.709 --> 00:08:18.829]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.290]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.031 --> 00:08:21.951]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:26.414]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.794 --> 00:08:30.856]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.408 --> 00:08:57.467]  I'm sure that most of you are already well aware of the fact that the Nazi porno man, conservative, who's for abortion and gun control and open borders, it's now coming out, is in a private collection of one of the most degenerate perverts of the modern age.
[00:08:58.749 --> 00:09:02.812]  And I don't even want to read this particular news article.
[00:09:02.872 --> 00:09:06.774]  It is posted on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:07.775 --> 00:09:09.596]  And yes, the photos have been blurred.
[00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:12.297]  These are some of the lighter photos.
[00:09:12.317 --> 00:09:13.358]  We'll just put it to you that way.
[00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:22.583]  We had actually done some research a few weeks ago when I was writing an article about Arnold and found some of the other photos of Arnold being naked.
[00:09:23.384 --> 00:09:28.287]  But there are supposedly other photos in a private collection that are even worse.
[00:09:29.273 --> 00:09:39.656]  By one of the famous photographers who put the crucifix, the cross with Christ on it, in the glass, the brandy glass with urine.
[00:09:40.417 --> 00:09:41.897]  Now that's as far as I can go.
[00:09:42.057 --> 00:09:43.417]  I can't tell you what else he did.
[00:09:44.338 --> 00:09:49.739]  But it turns out this was one of Arnold's special little friends, and they had some fun together.
[00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:51.620]  We'll just leave it at that.
[00:09:52.555 --> 00:09:55.557]  Hey, Arnold is probably going to be president someday.
[00:09:56.118 --> 00:09:57.719]  He says he's a Christian conservative.
[00:09:58.079 --> 00:10:03.524]  He's a member of a satanic organization, publicly praises Hitler and current Nazis.
[00:10:04.545 --> 00:10:07.187]  He is for abortion, gun control, everything evil.
[00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:11.390]  He is for CPS, taking people's children, and then homosexuals adopting them.
[00:10:12.185 --> 00:10:14.727]  He supports California's aggressive policy of doing that.
[00:10:15.128 --> 00:10:16.689]  He's a piece of total trash.
[00:10:16.789 --> 00:10:29.079]  So that's why you're going to hear the sickos like Limbaugh and the trash like O'Reilly and the garbage like Hannity, the socialistic big government enemy forces selling him to you.
[00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:29.900]  That's why.
[00:10:32.042 --> 00:10:38.167]  It's so incredible that the most liberal, socialistic, un-American, trash, liars...
[00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:44.569]  Are up there and you think they're conservatives as we're losing everything.
[00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:49.290]  America's dying right in front of you and they're selling you death.
[00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:51.591]  And you're buying it.
[00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:56.232]  I'm not talking to our general listeners.
[00:10:56.272 --> 00:10:59.172]  I'm just talking to people driving along going, I don't like Arnold.
[00:10:59.232 --> 00:11:02.513]  I've heard people, at least he's not Gray Davis.
[00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:08.689]  I hope Cruz Bustamante, that racist, gets arrested.
[00:11:08.729 --> 00:11:09.590]  Yeah, Freudian slip.
[00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:21.059]  I hope that that racist worm gets elected so people can see what La Raza, the race, is all about and what Mecha, La Reconquista, is all about.
[00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:25.642]  I don't like Worm Bustamante or Pig Schwarzenegger.
[00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:27.124]  They both make me sick.
[00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:28.685]  They're both New World Order whores.
[00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:29.826]  Literally.
[00:11:31.832 --> 00:11:34.593]  But at least we'll know what we've got with Bustamante.
[00:11:35.713 --> 00:11:37.213]  At least he says he's a racist.
[00:11:37.253 --> 00:11:38.854]  At least he says he doesn't like whites.
[00:11:39.174 --> 00:11:42.174]  At least he admitted in speeches that he wants to take over the Southwest.
[00:11:42.455 --> 00:11:43.995]  At least they're honest about it.
[00:11:44.175 --> 00:11:46.195]  We know Davis is an evil worm.
[00:11:48.236 --> 00:11:57.258]  But I'm so sick of these neocon trash brains everywhere, lying and spewing and giggling and laughing.
[00:11:58.237 --> 00:12:01.860]  I heard one of their little floozies on the air driving into the studio this morning.
[00:12:03.882 --> 00:12:07.745]  And I heard one of the floozies, and she was like, My book's only number seven.
[00:12:07.905 --> 00:12:09.386]  Al Franken's number one.
[00:12:09.666 --> 00:12:10.467]  Go buy it.
[00:12:10.587 --> 00:12:11.908]  Show the liberals.
[00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.892]  Go buy some neocon trash.
[00:12:16.932 --> 00:12:20.735]  It's another flavor of political cyanide.
[00:12:22.543 --> 00:12:23.724]  I mean, what a joke.
[00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:25.727]  You ever read those neocon books?
[00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:28.070]  It's all just like, Hillary's so stupid.
[00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.032]  She's a dummy.
[00:12:30.352 --> 00:12:31.414]  He don't like her.
[00:12:31.474 --> 00:12:33.536]  Yeah, yeah, why don't you talk about how you're protecting her?
[00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:37.260]  I don't want to hear about Hillary or Bill Clinton anymore!
[00:12:37.641 --> 00:12:38.362]  I hate them!
[00:12:38.882 --> 00:12:40.084]  I can't stand them!
[00:12:40.324 --> 00:12:41.906]  I get sick when I look at them!
[00:12:42.166 --> 00:12:42.547]  Okay?
[00:12:43.746 --> 00:12:55.149]  And I even get sicker when I watch you talk about how they're bad all day, knowing that your little creature, that blue blood from Kennebunkport, Maine, George W.
[00:12:55.169 --> 00:13:00.150]  Jr., sitting up there talking about how conservative he is when he's protecting Bill Clinton.
[00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.671]  I want Bill Clinton in prison for all the crimes he's committed!
[00:13:05.506 --> 00:13:06.286]  Do you understand?
[00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:07.267]  I'm about action.
[00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:08.247]  I'm about reality.
[00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:13.269]  I'm about real things, not about being an idiot, not about being conned.
[00:13:13.469 --> 00:13:15.489]  I'm sick of watching people be conned.
[00:13:15.749 --> 00:13:16.890]  I'm angry about it.
[00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:30.174]  Okay, we're going to have wide-open phones today, my friends, and if you disagree with me, you agree with me, you've got a news item you want to mention, some propaganda you saw on television, we'd love to hear from you.
[00:13:31.395 --> 00:13:35.136]  And I really have been better the last few days at taking calls and
[00:13:35.726 --> 00:13:42.888]  Taking more of the calls and getting to more of the people and then actually I bite down on a piece of wood and let you talk as long as I can, you know.
[00:13:44.328 --> 00:13:46.649]  Somebody looked like a wooden spoon on my mouth.
[00:13:46.989 --> 00:13:49.169]  I want to interrupt them, but I'm getting better.
[00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.331]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:55.891 --> 00:14:01.272]  Do the neocons make you want to vomit?
[00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:05.173]  Are you sick of their beady eyes that
[00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:18.569]  That one guy, Scarborough, it ought to be called Pico Hour, of the Pico Hour, with the government disinformation agent, Scarborough, raping America country.
[00:14:21.013 --> 00:14:26.655]  I mean, all he does is get socialists up there and let them make their points, and he comes back with the most mindless answers.
[00:14:27.136 --> 00:14:28.996]  He doesn't even go through one layer of the onion.
[00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:36.319]  He talks about the liberals all day, and, you know, the show's some topless dancers on almost every show, and, oh, we hate to show you all this sex.
[00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:37.360]  We're conservative.
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.501]  And then he gets up there, and George Bush is good.
[00:14:41.521 --> 00:14:42.842]  The liberals are trying to get him.
[00:14:43.422 --> 00:14:47.224]  Nothing about how Bush is rubbing borders or massive gun control or protecting Bill Clinton.
[00:14:47.584 --> 00:14:48.764]  And he has those beady eyes.
[00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:50.045]  You can't even see his eyes.
[00:14:51.047 --> 00:14:52.408]  Reading off that teleprompter.
[00:14:53.048 --> 00:14:57.750]  Don't you understand that's MSNBC, the liberals, selling you this neocon garbage?
[00:15:00.792 --> 00:15:02.493]  And that's why they're destroying America right now.
[00:15:02.513 --> 00:15:05.554]  Can you imagine if Bill Clinton or Al Gore was trying all this right now?
[00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:12.578]  Can you imagine if those pieces of unbelievable garbage...
[00:15:14.682 --> 00:15:21.308]  Those un-American, freedom-hating, family-hating, larcenous pieces of filth.
[00:15:25.231 --> 00:15:30.335]  Imagine those societal plaques.
[00:15:31.376 --> 00:15:32.977]  That's what they are, dirty little plaques.
[00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:36.580]  Imagine if they were in office right now.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:36.760]  Imagine.
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.241]  Imagine.
[00:15:37.845 --> 00:15:38.906]  Trying to get their agenda through.
[00:15:38.946 --> 00:15:44.971]  But see, their agenda will get through after we have the big left-wing counterswing against Bush.
[00:15:46.713 --> 00:15:47.533]  You understand that.
[00:15:47.593 --> 00:15:53.458]  You understand Bush is about destroying America's image worldwide, about making the U.N.
[00:15:53.498 --> 00:15:57.722]  look good and making the IMF and World Bank and the Euro look good.
[00:15:58.743 --> 00:16:03.227]  It's about getting the third world to all dump the dollar and jump on the bandwagon with the Euro.
[00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:13.145]  And then the European Union comes out of the snow like a rose, and we will officially be a third world cesspool with no borders, destruction of our economy, and a miserable dollar.
[00:16:13.345 --> 00:16:15.686]  You're about to turn into a third world slave, folks.
[00:16:17.287 --> 00:16:19.248]  You can try to keep up appearances all you want.
[00:16:19.348 --> 00:16:19.889]  It's happening.
[00:16:20.969 --> 00:16:23.691]  England is going down the tubes with us as well.
[00:16:25.052 --> 00:16:25.792]  Because they hate us.
[00:16:25.832 --> 00:16:26.993]  They hate the American people.
[00:16:27.233 --> 00:16:28.274]  They hate the British people.
[00:16:28.494 --> 00:16:31.196]  They got control of our governments, and they're going to use us up.
[00:16:32.376 --> 00:16:33.477]  Use up our substance...
[00:16:34.116 --> 00:16:35.717]  To expand the New World Order.
[00:16:36.337 --> 00:16:37.897]  We're owned by the Europeans.
[00:16:38.358 --> 00:16:39.878]  They use us as the bad cop.
[00:16:40.078 --> 00:16:43.760]  When they're done with us, they throw us away and say, oh, I got rid of that bad person.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:57.465]  But you watch, none of the territory, none of the seven nations they're going to attack, the Syrians, the Irans, the North Koreans, there's going to be no liberty or freedom in those countries, and the globalists are going to run those countries, and we're going to take the blame, and we're going to lose the soldiers doing it.
[00:17:00.242 --> 00:17:01.223]  And then I look at this.
[00:17:01.323 --> 00:17:02.605]  I mean, I already knew about this.
[00:17:03.206 --> 00:17:05.208]  Folks, this has been in newspapers back in the 80s.
[00:17:05.228 --> 00:17:06.009]  I remember seeing this.
[00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:15.079]  Arnold just was basically on the homosexual circuit from the beginning in Europe.
[00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:18.784]  That's how he made his money in Germany and then in England.
[00:17:19.745 --> 00:17:21.567]  I remember reading those articles in the late 80s about it.
[00:17:23.721 --> 00:17:25.502]  And weeks ago, we were looking around.
[00:17:25.782 --> 00:17:26.902]  We heard they were out there.
[00:17:26.922 --> 00:17:28.463]  Yeah, there were the naked pictures of Arnold.
[00:17:28.483 --> 00:17:29.483]  We didn't put them on the website.
[00:17:29.523 --> 00:17:30.504]  Now there's one up on Drudge.
[00:17:30.524 --> 00:17:31.184]  We have a link to it.
[00:17:31.424 --> 00:17:32.765]  He's blurted out, which is good.
[00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:36.046]  But, I mean, that's just the stuff that's public.
[00:17:36.166 --> 00:17:37.587]  You know, the stuff he did for magazines.
[00:17:37.687 --> 00:17:42.989]  There are these private collections of the rich perverts.
[00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:50.372]  And, you know, this one guy who likes to put crosses in urine and other things I'm not going to mention here.
[00:17:51.914 --> 00:17:59.400]  Well, there's this real, there's this special private collection, and, well, let's just say if it comes out, Arnold will probably get even more votes.
[00:17:59.921 --> 00:18:01.322]  He'll go, oh, that's conservative!
[00:18:01.962 --> 00:18:02.483]  Let me see.
[00:18:02.963 --> 00:18:08.248]  Anti-gun, pro-abortion, open border, and he's in triple-X porn scenes.
[00:18:08.928 --> 00:18:09.849]  Oh, this is wonderful.
[00:18:09.869 --> 00:18:11.430]  This is pure conservatism.
[00:18:12.111 --> 00:18:13.772]  And again, this show is pure liberalism.
[00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:17.195]  Pro-gun, pro-border, pro-sovereignty, anti-UN.
[00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:19.257]  We're basically communist here, folks.
[00:18:20.296 --> 00:18:21.817]  And again, I've been accused of that.
[00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:26.658]  We gotta compromise and let Bush have some gun control, boy.
[00:18:26.678 --> 00:18:32.180]  I've been on so-called conservative stations and had them say, You gotta compromise with him.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.461]  I don't think you're from Texas, are you, Mr. Jones?
[00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:37.142]  Bush is a good Texan.
[00:18:37.162 --> 00:18:38.422]  We like him.
[00:18:42.544 --> 00:18:43.264]  It's amazing.
[00:18:44.785 --> 00:18:48.406]  And yes, foreign troops were in Scotland causing a big problem.
[00:18:49.494 --> 00:18:53.115]  BBC reports the people are very angry about what the foreign troops did to them.
[00:18:53.815 --> 00:18:54.976]  Well, just like the U.S.
[00:18:55.016 --> 00:19:02.978]  now, the foreign troops always run drills and harass people and, well, tried to kill some cops outside Fort Bragg, and they got killed instead.
[00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:04.699]  You know, just little reports like that.
[00:19:04.719 --> 00:19:05.799]  I got a report here.
[00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:13.242]  The foreign Eastern Bloc troops are, you know, in Scotland letting folks know who the new bosses are, and there was a little bit of a problem.
[00:19:15.015 --> 00:19:17.096]  Ukrainian Marines stop drivers.
[00:19:17.276 --> 00:19:17.496]  Oh!
[00:19:19.197 --> 00:19:20.398]  BBC!
[00:19:21.258 --> 00:19:30.603]  An apology has been issued to civilians caught up in an incident involving armed soldiers taking part in a NATO exercise in southwest Scotland.
[00:19:31.984 --> 00:19:37.027]  I guess, like, suddenly they had two cases of troops trying to disarm police officers and the cops had to blow them away.
[00:19:38.323 --> 00:19:39.783]  I guess that was just an accident.
[00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:42.404]  The black helicopters ravaging South Texas in 99.
[00:19:42.784 --> 00:19:43.724]  Buildings blowing up.
[00:19:43.764 --> 00:19:46.325]  Czechoslovakians screaming, firing automatic weapons.
[00:19:47.405 --> 00:19:48.945]  Just all accidental, of course.
[00:19:49.625 --> 00:19:50.886]  Old ladies having heart attacks.
[00:19:52.846 --> 00:19:54.326]  Again, smoke everywhere.
[00:19:54.346 --> 00:19:55.827]  It's all part of freedom.
[00:19:56.227 --> 00:19:58.147]  Police threatening to arrest anyone that came out of their houses.
[00:19:58.687 --> 00:19:59.787]  We'll get to that, too.
[00:19:59.807 --> 00:20:03.188]  Just massive conditioning for your foreign troops.
[00:20:03.288 --> 00:20:04.949]  I mean, the Russians are allies.
[00:20:05.049 --> 00:20:07.029]  They're going to have to occupy us.
[00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:18.774]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling clean water possible.

[00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:37.585]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:20:37.745 --> 00:20:38.246]  We're good to go.

[00:20:59.106 --> 00:20:59.807]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:22:09.321 --> 00:22:10.321]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:10.401 --> 00:22:15.183]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:15.343 --> 00:22:23.145]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:23.405 --> 00:22:28.767]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:28.987 --> 00:22:35.969]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:36.209 --> 00:22:36.689]  We're good to go.
[00:22:58.016 --> 00:23:01.119]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:23:01.439 --> 00:23:04.962]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:05.302 --> 00:23:05.862]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:05.902 --> 00:23:10.586]  Hey, John Statman here, and I have a question for you.
[00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:12.327]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[00:23:12.668 --> 00:23:15.310]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.431]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[00:23:17.712 --> 00:23:20.654]  Do you have the energy you need to do all the things in life that you need to do?
[00:23:20.974 --> 00:23:22.756]  If you're like most people, the answer is no.
[00:23:23.096 --> 00:23:26.839]  And that extra cup of coffee or an afternoon candy bar is not the solution.
[00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:27.559]  We're good to go.
[00:23:57.022 --> 00:24:01.185]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:01.205 --> 00:24:02.786]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:24.841 --> 00:24:32.043]  All right, folks, we're going to go right to your calls, and I'm going to come back in the next segment, get more into the loving foreign troops shoving families around in Scotland.
[00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:38.636]  Just accidentally, from Texas to Scotland, foreign troops have to shove women and children around at checkpoints.
[00:24:38.676 --> 00:24:44.719]  It just accidentally keeps happening, along with buildings blowing up and black helicopters swarming everywhere.
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.822]  And we'll get into Arnold and his Christian conservatism at the Grove, the Bohemian Grove.
[00:24:50.403 --> 00:24:53.905]  I would hope that all the listeners would go to Infowars.com and get the article I wrote.
[00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:54.565]  It's lengthy.
[00:24:54.886 --> 00:24:56.166]  And email it out to everybody.
[00:24:56.226 --> 00:25:01.870]  It's the most detailed, documented, factual account of this neocon whore story.
[00:25:03.087 --> 00:25:06.049]  Out there in existence, so please email it out to everybody, folks.
[00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:11.552]  Everybody's to know the truth about the evil Republican Party that is more socialistic than the Democrats.
[00:25:11.692 --> 00:25:12.513]  Yes, it's true.
[00:25:13.093 --> 00:25:16.475]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in New York.
[00:25:16.555 --> 00:25:17.556]  Brian, you're on the air.
[00:25:17.596 --> 00:25:18.036]  Go ahead.
[00:25:18.257 --> 00:25:19.217]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[00:25:19.237 --> 00:25:20.558]  Thank you for taking my call, sir.
[00:25:20.698 --> 00:25:21.078]  You bet.
[00:25:21.739 --> 00:25:24.641]  Mr. Jones, I'm your place on your website from the London Guardian.
[00:25:25.021 --> 00:25:27.082]  Now to keep the newspaper on Friday, September 19, 2003.
[00:25:29.307 --> 00:25:31.649]  The International Monetary Fund is saying that the U.S.
[00:25:31.689 --> 00:25:33.110]  dollar could collapse any moment.
[00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.092]  Yeah, London Guardian read that Monday.
[00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:37.374]  They said it will collapse.
[00:25:37.794 --> 00:25:45.980]  It's designed to collapse, but they're posing as the good cops saying they're going to take over and, quote, take our standard of living down as they had called four years ago.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.405]  Well, what they're saying to the Brotherhood of the Luciferians is that it's the beginning of a casual society.
[00:25:51.525 --> 00:25:54.327]  Once the American dollar goes phenomenal, it's the first of the U.S.
[00:25:54.387 --> 00:25:55.388]  dollar British pounds.
[00:25:55.885 --> 00:25:58.088]  And the IMF and World Bank will come in and restructure things.
[00:25:58.128 --> 00:26:00.352]  They reach the point that the paper money is beyond their control.
[00:26:13.171 --> 00:26:21.017]  And that's why they're coming out with the new money to actually restrict and call in the old notes.
[00:26:21.477 --> 00:26:23.219]  This whole thing is by design.
[00:26:23.239 --> 00:26:27.161]  Then the IMF and World Bank that engineered this are going to pose as our saviors.
[00:26:27.662 --> 00:26:30.844]  Well, the idea is that the new currency is going to be an internal currency.
[00:26:30.864 --> 00:26:32.846]  Your old currency will be an external currency.
[00:26:33.326 --> 00:26:37.109]  When the police state begins, the first thing you do is you can't take money out of the country.
[00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:38.770]  So this is the first big step for them.
[00:26:39.326 --> 00:26:39.586]  We're good.
[00:26:57.734 --> 00:27:03.355]  They can't go back to gold and silver because there's too much paper out there in the world, and there's not enough metals to cover the paper.
[00:27:03.716 --> 00:27:04.256]  Well, that's it.
[00:27:04.296 --> 00:27:16.579]  They've already, I mean, it's several thousand times the derivatives of the paper, the speculation on actual gold that's in existence out of the ground, and they tried to do that to keep the price down to buy the futures on the gold.
[00:27:16.639 --> 00:27:17.999]  Now that's blowing up in their face.
[00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:21.500]  But understand the globalists are engineering this.
[00:27:22.282 --> 00:27:33.051]  And to see the IMF gloating that the dollar's in trouble and to have Snow, the Treasury Secretary, bad-mouthing the dollar, and people are going, oh, how good, the dollar's plunging.
[00:27:33.071 --> 00:27:40.917]  Well, Secretary Snow, he went to Japan because when he's trying to make a floating yen, he's trying to tell them not to buy any more than T-bonds.
[00:27:41.778 --> 00:27:43.499]  But what the Chinese are going to double-cross them.
[00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:47.802]  The Chinese will bail out Japan, and the Chinese will buy all the gold that they can grab.
[00:27:47.903 --> 00:27:49.584]  So the idea is when this thing happens,
[00:27:50.342 --> 00:27:55.464]  Like I've been saying, this is all set up to destroy America, because America is the example of the nation state.
[00:27:55.824 --> 00:28:11.751]  And then, out of this crisis, during this depression, the feds will blow lots of stuff up, and there'll be lots of crying on TV, and, well, I'm losing my house, I've got to go to the work brigade, it's all part of the national draft, but, hey, they've got to pledge allegiance to the new leader, and he's saving us during this crisis.
[00:28:12.211 --> 00:28:19.574]  That's why if there is a major economic collapse, if it gets worse, you will see the globalist carry out terror, and it just goes downhill from there.
[00:28:19.634 --> 00:28:25.156]  But I'll tell you, Brian, they've been having a lot of trouble getting their whole police state system in place.
[00:28:26.017 --> 00:28:34.140]  And let me tell you, there's been a lot of resistance to them, and their system is badly damaged, and their propaganda is badly coordinated.
[00:28:35.961 --> 00:28:37.721]  I tell you, things are unraveling.
[00:28:37.761 --> 00:28:38.782]  Things are out of control.
[00:28:39.798 --> 00:28:41.179]  That's what makes them so dangerous.
[00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:42.740]  They're like a rat in a corner.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.381]  Now they're going to do something very desperate.
[00:28:44.602 --> 00:28:46.303]  As you said, the economy is collapsing.
[00:28:46.883 --> 00:28:51.987]  And the thing is, before that happens, the American people are going to run after them with pitchforks and torches.
[00:28:52.588 --> 00:28:53.949]  They have to hit the American city.
[00:28:53.989 --> 00:28:55.450]  This is why they're aggravating North Korea.
[00:28:55.570 --> 00:29:00.413]  They could drop a bomb on the city before this economy virtually collapses and takes the heat off of them.
[00:29:00.854 --> 00:29:01.254]  Exactly.
[00:29:01.274 --> 00:29:08.179]  I mean, folks, if we have a smoldering city or a smallpox outbreak, they haven't lined up to, quote, put you in work brigades until you're like 49 years old.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:23.110]  Make you dig ditches, press all professionals, engineers, doctors, lawyers, end of service engineers, I mentioned that, forced inoculations, hurting us in the compact cities, and they've been preparing for this.
[00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:24.731]  There's a problem though, Brian.
[00:29:25.732 --> 00:29:30.555]  99 plus percent of their police and medical workers said no to the smallpox shot.
[00:29:30.795 --> 00:29:33.657]  They're saying no to the forced inoculation plans for us.
[00:29:33.957 --> 00:29:36.359]  So what are they going to do if their own minions don't follow orders?
[00:29:36.659 --> 00:29:40.482]  The answer is Eastern Bloc troops massing inside the country.
[00:29:41.463 --> 00:29:43.144]  Just like we have in the BBC.
[00:29:43.204 --> 00:29:44.465]  Brian, would you like to comment on that?
[00:29:45.005 --> 00:29:50.950]  Yes, so what is happening is they have to put different troops in different parts of the world to get people to obey the new world order.
[00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:51.470]  That's it.
[00:29:53.151 --> 00:29:54.132]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[00:29:54.733 --> 00:29:55.293]  Not for today, sir.
[00:29:55.313 --> 00:29:55.594]  Thank you.
[00:29:55.654 --> 00:29:56.134]  Thank you.
[00:29:56.314 --> 00:29:56.634]  All right.
[00:29:56.674 --> 00:29:57.675]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:29:57.695 --> 00:29:58.215]  Stay with us.
[00:30:00.456 --> 00:30:01.417]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.857 --> 00:30:03.458]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.378 --> 00:30:07.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:16.238]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:30:16.538 --> 00:30:20.600]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.300]  448 to learn more.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.261]  That's 1-888-826-4448 or visit Bob on the internet at www.watershed.net.
[00:30:42.094 --> 00:30:43.795]  I can't back down, my friends.
[00:30:45.256 --> 00:30:47.478]  Yeah, people say, oh, nothing bad's going to happen.
[00:30:47.578 --> 00:30:50.280]  Alex Jones is just getting a little too upset about things.
[00:30:52.021 --> 00:30:55.423]  Folks, the globalists killed 200 million people in the last century.
[00:30:55.663 --> 00:30:57.064]  They're not playing games.
[00:30:57.705 --> 00:31:08.392]  They put dictators in who scientifically follow the exact same program of enslavement, getting the people dependent on government and then exterminating them with extreme prejudice.
[00:31:09.321 --> 00:31:14.682]  This is how they break down existing societies and replace it with the beehive slave mentality.
[00:31:15.562 --> 00:31:19.863]  I was about to go to Hank in Texas, but he hung up, so we're going to go to Garrett, Dan, Jeffrey, Mark, and others.
[00:31:21.584 --> 00:31:24.845]  And Brian in New York just called in, and I'm glad he did.
[00:31:24.865 --> 00:31:34.627]  I took a lot of calls Monday and Tuesday on a bunch of subjects, but nobody called in about the major story I talked about on Monday, London Guardian, where the IMF said that
[00:31:35.413 --> 00:31:46.122]  The dollar's going to plunge, and we're going to have a big depression, and it's not a question of if but when, and the IMF's going to lower our standard of living and merge us with the global government, and that's going to take good care of us.
[00:31:46.783 --> 00:31:48.685]  That's a big deal, folks.
[00:31:49.586 --> 00:32:01.376]  The International Monetary Fund, the bankruptcy receivership corporation, is saying that to us and telling us we've outlived our means and we're bad when they engineered this whole system.
[00:32:03.496 --> 00:32:06.398]  So, kudos to you, Brian, for calling in on that subject.
[00:32:06.778 --> 00:32:15.643]  I'd like to get some calls about Dick Cheney in one of the PNAC documents saying he wants to develop race-specific bioweapons to kill certain races, that that quote is going to be legitimate.
[00:32:16.824 --> 00:32:17.164]  I don't know.
[00:32:17.224 --> 00:32:18.645]  I think that's kind of a big deal.
[00:32:18.665 --> 00:32:20.907]  You know, I'm kind of an extremist.
[00:32:21.547 --> 00:32:23.928]  But maybe you want to comment on Arnold.
[00:32:23.968 --> 00:32:31.253]  It turns out there's private collections of him doing interesting things, not just posing naked for...
[00:32:31.946 --> 00:32:32.586]  We're good to go.
[00:32:59.844 --> 00:33:08.051]  And of course, Arnold came out and said that, well, he lied in Rolling Stone and Playboy that we interview.
[00:33:08.451 --> 00:33:14.476]  He lied about the orgies and he lied about all the drugs and all that just to get attention.
[00:33:14.496 --> 00:33:15.737]  Well, that's even worse.
[00:33:16.277 --> 00:33:17.758]  But of course, we know he wasn't lying.
[00:33:17.978 --> 00:33:18.699]  He's lying now.
[00:33:19.511 --> 00:33:21.892]  And some will say, hey, wait a minute, Alex.
[00:33:21.932 --> 00:33:24.714]  You've been interviewed by these worldly magazines.
[00:33:25.214 --> 00:33:29.096]  I've been interviewed by Playboy, but I have been interviewed by rock and roll magazines and stuff.
[00:33:29.657 --> 00:33:31.037]  And why are you doing that?
[00:33:31.117 --> 00:33:39.002]  Well, I think Christ said that he went out and ministered to those that were sick, those that had problems.
[00:33:39.062 --> 00:33:41.123]  I'm not saying I'm Jesus Christ.
[00:33:41.143 --> 00:33:44.385]  What I'm saying is that isn't that where the missionary should be?
[00:33:45.926 --> 00:33:47.066]  I'll go out and I'll address...
[00:33:48.963 --> 00:33:53.369]  People at a rock concert or something, if they ask me to come speak at it.
[00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:58.035]  Though this year I got invited to South by Southwest and they wanted me to emcee some big event.
[00:33:58.075 --> 00:33:59.256]  I just said no, I was too busy.
[00:33:59.276 --> 00:34:01.319]  But my point is, I'll go talk to anybody.
[00:34:02.213 --> 00:34:03.494]  I'll go talk to a group of atheists.
[00:34:03.534 --> 00:34:09.399]  I'll go talk to a group of whatever's, Buddhists, and try to wake them up about the New World Order.
[00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:14.103]  The difference is, people say, well, don't criticize Arnold why Mel Gibson was interviewed by Playboy.
[00:34:14.403 --> 00:34:18.326]  Yeah, Mel Gibson talked about the New World Order and the Federal Reserve and how it was evil.
[00:34:18.607 --> 00:34:20.708]  He was reaching out, trying to educate people.
[00:34:21.029 --> 00:34:23.651]  Arnold Schwarzenegger went in there and said how great orgies are.
[00:34:25.891 --> 00:34:26.932]  It's amazing.
[00:34:27.492 --> 00:34:29.574]  It's not bad to be interviewed by those magazines.
[00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:31.175]  It's good to try to educate those folks.
[00:34:31.195 --> 00:34:35.118]  What's bad is to go and be worse than the stuff in the magazines.
[00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:35.899]  You understand that?
[00:34:38.882 --> 00:34:39.662]  Oh, it's incredible.
[00:34:41.143 --> 00:34:42.404]  So we'll talk about that as well.
[00:34:42.464 --> 00:34:45.627]  Right now, let's talk to Garrett in Louisiana.
[00:34:45.667 --> 00:34:46.988]  Garrett, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:34:47.008 --> 00:34:48.209]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:34:48.269 --> 00:34:48.850]  Pretty good, sir.
[00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.571]  It's been a long time, my friend.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:55.923]  About 14 months ago, I graduated from Mississippi State with an engineering degree.
[00:34:55.983 --> 00:34:59.925]  I remember you wrote articles for the local paper, excellent articles.
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:01.846]  Oh, yes, sir, yeah, for the school paper.
[00:35:02.287 --> 00:35:06.749]  And I've kind of been out in the loot in the political game a little bit.
[00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:15.175]  I've been spending the past 14 months following my second Bible, which is John Wesley Rawls' book, Patriot, Surviving the Coming Collapse.
[00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:21.031]  And concentrating on buying everything I can possible to survive with.
[00:35:21.271 --> 00:35:28.636]  You know, I was going to have Rawls on one day, and for some reason canceled the interview, and I want to get him back on the show.
[00:35:29.497 --> 00:35:30.057]  Oh, definitely.
[00:35:30.217 --> 00:35:32.599]  That's the Bible as far as I'm concerned.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.841]  Well, I apologize to John Wesley Rawls.
[00:35:35.861 --> 00:35:37.422]  It was like there was some big news of it.
[00:35:37.462 --> 00:35:39.804]  The day was supposed to come on, and I canceled by two guests.
[00:35:40.384 --> 00:35:41.946]  I want to get him on the show.
[00:35:41.986 --> 00:35:42.906]  That book's incredible.
[00:35:43.367 --> 00:35:43.867]  Yes, it is.
[00:35:44.471 --> 00:35:47.552]  There's also a piece of information that came out September the 8th, 2003.
[00:35:48.312 --> 00:35:50.012]  I don't know if it's on your website or not.
[00:35:50.472 --> 00:35:52.572]  An article written by John Loeffler.
[00:35:53.553 --> 00:35:56.353]  It comes from newswithviews.com.
[00:35:56.693 --> 00:35:56.993]  Yes.
[00:35:57.433 --> 00:35:59.314]  And it's like the New World Order for Dummies.
[00:35:59.334 --> 00:36:00.654]  You know how they have the Dummies books?
[00:36:01.554 --> 00:36:08.835]  This is a very broken down and tip of the iceberg five-page article that people can read and understand what is going on.
[00:36:08.915 --> 00:36:11.156]  Now, isn't that on prisonplanet.com?
[00:36:11.776 --> 00:36:12.296]  I think so.
[00:36:12.316 --> 00:36:12.736]  Yeah.
[00:36:12.836 --> 00:36:12.856]  I...
[00:36:14.594 --> 00:36:18.658]  I dropped a copy of this around the house trying to get my parents curious.
[00:36:18.798 --> 00:36:19.979]  They've all laughed at me.
[00:36:19.999 --> 00:36:21.961]  My whole family the past three years.
[00:36:22.661 --> 00:36:25.064]  I was watching a football game in the other room.
[00:36:25.544 --> 00:36:27.085]  Some of my uncles were over visiting.
[00:36:27.105 --> 00:36:29.748]  They got on a subject about crime.
[00:36:30.228 --> 00:36:32.370]  We just don't have any freedom in this country anymore.
[00:36:33.011 --> 00:36:34.172]  I muted the football game.
[00:36:34.514 --> 00:36:39.616]  I put the recliner down and looked and I said, what the heck have I been telling you for the past three years?
[00:36:39.816 --> 00:36:46.518]  I got on my soapbox a little bit and I just shut up because I lost them after about five minutes and put my feet up again.
[00:36:46.658 --> 00:36:51.620]  This article right here, I think, would help me to start.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:37:02.784]  If people want to get serious, they need to get the Patriots book and several other references to know what they need to be spending their money on, and that is bullets, things,
[00:37:03.277 --> 00:37:04.498]  Band-Aids and bullion.
[00:37:05.358 --> 00:37:06.058]  The four B's.
[00:37:07.499 --> 00:37:10.380]  Bullets, band-aids, beans, and bullion.
[00:37:10.721 --> 00:37:10.861]  Yep.
[00:37:11.861 --> 00:37:21.686]  Well, you know, I've had family go, I mean, basically boiling it down, you mean the government did something corrupt once?
[00:37:21.846 --> 00:37:23.427]  That's crazy!
[00:37:24.487 --> 00:37:27.909]  And, again, I mean, there's this mindless, gullible attitude.
[00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:29.828]  Read the history books.
[00:37:29.948 --> 00:37:31.230]  Read just news articles.
[00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:32.692]  Folks, you ought to go to the library.
[00:37:32.712 --> 00:37:34.013]  There's something still on microfiche.
[00:37:34.915 --> 00:37:37.919]  Pull up a Kansas City Star article from 1885.
[00:37:37.999 --> 00:37:39.861]  It's, don't trust the government.
[00:37:39.921 --> 00:37:40.462]  It's evil.
[00:37:40.863 --> 00:37:41.804]  Watch everybody.
[00:37:41.844 --> 00:37:43.546]  Don't trust any of these feds.
[00:37:45.088 --> 00:37:45.329]  I mean...
[00:37:46.542 --> 00:37:47.323]  We're good to go.
[00:37:47.363 --> 00:37:47.603]  I think?
[00:38:09.932 --> 00:38:16.759]  I mean, I've got articles here today where they admit that it's not 2,000, it's more like 3,000 people that the government of Houston admits they framed.
[00:38:16.819 --> 00:38:18.241]  Just blanket frame.
[00:38:18.521 --> 00:38:19.382]  Tulia, Texas.
[00:38:19.722 --> 00:38:22.445]  They just arrested 56 people, no drugs, no paraphernalia.
[00:38:22.705 --> 00:38:24.607]  People got 20 to 90 years in prison.
[00:38:24.647 --> 00:38:25.648]  They knew they were innocent.
[00:38:25.848 --> 00:38:26.509]  They didn't care.
[00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:28.992]  They were getting bonuses for drug crime convictions.
[00:38:31.136 --> 00:38:32.577]  There's a new article in Houston.
[00:38:32.617 --> 00:38:34.597]  This is Houston Chronicle today.
[00:38:34.637 --> 00:38:42.240]  The cops go around and tell bars, we're going to bust you for alcohol or for selling to underage people unless you pay us $50 a night.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.481]  They have little collection rackets.
[00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.762]  I mean, there is corruption.
[00:38:45.962 --> 00:38:48.543]  And the point is, we're not saying cops are worse than the average person.
[00:38:48.563 --> 00:38:49.223]  We're not saying that...
[00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:51.971]  Judges are worse than the average person.
[00:38:52.291 --> 00:38:59.355]  The point is, when you get corrupt evil people in those positions of power, the capacity for abuse is so much larger.
[00:38:59.975 --> 00:39:05.418]  And it can be sustained because it is the officialdom, the government, the authority.
[00:39:06.119 --> 00:39:07.700]  And that's the danger.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.900]  And we've lost that.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:16.484]  And these poor saps that will laugh at you and go, I bet you just don't like nothing about the government.
[00:39:16.945 --> 00:39:18.926]  I just want to slap these idiots.
[00:39:21.149 --> 00:39:22.110]  Thanks for the call, Garrett.
[00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:23.130]  Good to hear from you.
[00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.831]  Dan in New York.
[00:39:25.011 --> 00:39:25.772]  Go ahead, Dan.
[00:39:26.893 --> 00:39:28.814]  Yes, Alex.
[00:39:29.054 --> 00:39:30.895]  Things are bad today, and they're going to get worse.
[00:39:31.676 --> 00:39:33.437]  And I'm not pessimistic about it.
[00:39:33.477 --> 00:39:36.138]  I'm optimistic, but I'm with you on this.
[00:39:36.679 --> 00:39:41.962]  The men that brought us this great nation, the first thing that they did was turn to God.
[00:39:42.802 --> 00:39:44.884]  And I know that your show is not a religious show.
[00:39:44.984 --> 00:39:50.287]  In fact, religion is the opposite of everything the Bible talks about and everything that Christ says.
[00:39:50.925 --> 00:39:56.990]  He stood up against the establishment, the Pharisees.
[00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:58.371]  Exactly, yes, yes.
[00:39:58.931 --> 00:40:04.696]  And so in the spirit of sharing free ideas, I appreciate you having me take my call here.
[00:40:05.176 --> 00:40:06.377]  I just want to share a couple things.
[00:40:07.178 --> 00:40:10.460]  Love is patient and is kind, and it does not envy.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.102]  It does not parade itself and is not puffed up.
[00:40:13.582 --> 00:40:15.844]  It does not behave rudely and does not seek its own.
[00:40:15.944 --> 00:40:18.046]  It is not provoked, and it thinks no evil.
[00:40:18.533 --> 00:40:19.494]  I think we're good to go.
[00:40:47.853 --> 00:40:52.935]  And love is what Christ did when he walked on the earth and he died for the sins of all those that are willing to accept him.
[00:40:53.515 --> 00:41:00.838]  And, Alex, in the midst of all of this evil, we just need to keep our focus on goodness and the goodness that Christ did for us.
[00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:07.921]  And that's the strength that our forefathers dwelled upon and pulled from to fight the battle that they fought.
[00:41:07.941 --> 00:41:09.241]  And that's the battle that we're in today.
[00:41:09.501 --> 00:41:11.102]  And, Alex, I appreciate you taking my call.
[00:41:11.142 --> 00:41:11.522]  God bless.
[00:41:11.882 --> 00:41:12.482]  Absolutely.
[00:41:12.542 --> 00:41:13.103]  Thank you.
[00:41:13.243 --> 00:41:16.424]  And that really does condense it.
[00:41:17.825 --> 00:41:19.946]  What the caller just said, what Dan just said.
[00:41:21.427 --> 00:41:37.675]  Everything in civilization, in history, is about the individual and their family defending against the tyranny of stronger men, of ruthless Mongols.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:52.163]  And ruthless Nazis and ruthless communists and ruthless Aztecs going and enslaving and killing and making a religion of a predatory system feeding on humanity.
[00:41:52.223 --> 00:41:54.664]  Really, the New World Order is cannibalistic.
[00:41:55.244 --> 00:42:03.046]  It breeds and controls and orchestrates civilizations and their degradation, their rebuilding.
[00:42:04.167 --> 00:42:04.928]  And their destruction.
[00:42:04.948 --> 00:42:07.311]  People have forgotten that.
[00:42:07.351 --> 00:42:09.133]  They've forgotten the basics of history.
[00:42:09.654 --> 00:42:11.957]  Everything we've got is because of the struggles.
[00:42:12.717 --> 00:42:23.711]  Because I had forefathers that got shot and killed and tortured and went down on ships into Davy Jones' locker under the water so we could have liberty.
[00:42:25.183 --> 00:42:31.625]  And the risk that was taken and everything we've gone through, whether you're Native American, black, white, we all came through adversity.
[00:42:32.105 --> 00:42:38.447]  And we've all been enslaved and controlled and manipulated and we've stood up to it and had freedom for a time and then been enslaved again.
[00:42:38.827 --> 00:42:41.368]  And people have just forgotten all the human struggle.
[00:42:42.928 --> 00:42:44.068]  That's what life's about.
[00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:50.710]  And I'm committed to this fight and I just am so tired of the cynical, foolish yuppies.
[00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:53.631]  I'm talking about, you know,
[00:42:55.297 --> 00:43:10.986]  The arrogant people that think they're members of the establishment driving around in their BMWs that could care less about this country and who think they're part of the system and who will defend Bill Clinton or defend George Bush and will laugh at you when you warn them about history.
[00:43:12.987 --> 00:43:17.049]  And believe me, they'll do anything to keep their status, to keep their station.
[00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:22.812]  As things get worse and worse, they will get more and more ruthless people
[00:43:24.577 --> 00:43:31.140]  They'll rationalize to any point to keep the shekels in their purse, the 20 pieces of silver.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.761]  They'd sell out their mothers, their fathers, their children.
[00:43:34.021 --> 00:43:35.762]  They'll sell out their souls, folks.
[00:43:35.942 --> 00:43:37.203]  They're not alive.
[00:43:37.563 --> 00:43:42.245]  They're zombies programmed by the media, programmed by the television, programmed.
[00:43:42.825 --> 00:43:45.166]  I was reading an article out of Cosmopolitan yesterday.
[00:43:46.727 --> 00:43:47.207]  Online.
[00:43:47.227 --> 00:43:50.148]  They published it online before it goes in this month's Cosmopolitan.
[00:43:50.168 --> 00:43:53.890]  I don't take Cosmopolitan, but I was reading it online.
[00:43:54.727 --> 00:43:57.929]  We ought to post that, and it was soulless sex was the headline.
[00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:03.592]  And I was talking to some folks, and they go, oh, yeah, that's a big trend, soulless sex.
[00:44:04.973 --> 00:44:10.977]  The sorority girls all over the West, Western world, you know, the good girls.
[00:44:11.237 --> 00:44:12.438]  And I told you I've noticed this.
[00:44:12.478 --> 00:44:13.178]  I've seen this.
[00:44:14.619 --> 00:44:16.820]  You just go out and you have sex with gang members.
[00:44:17.281 --> 00:44:17.821]  You go and...
[00:44:18.599 --> 00:44:23.181]  And Cosmopolitan, and this was a feminist liberal writing this article, she said, you know, we were wrong about feminism.
[00:44:23.601 --> 00:44:24.882]  This has destroyed our women.
[00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:28.543]  The young girls aren't even having orgasms.
[00:44:29.363 --> 00:44:31.084]  They're not even enjoying it now.
[00:44:31.624 --> 00:44:32.564]  It's a fad.
[00:44:32.985 --> 00:44:33.825]  It's fashion.
[00:44:34.125 --> 00:44:36.026]  And fashion is mind control.
[00:44:36.066 --> 00:44:36.986]  The article admits it.
[00:44:37.846 --> 00:44:42.028]  And now they tell them fashion is going out and having sex with 40 people a month.
[00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:45.609]  That's more than one person a day.
[00:44:45.669 --> 00:44:46.930]  Well, then we just better do it.
[00:44:50.726 --> 00:44:51.967]  See, it's a culture of death.
[00:44:52.147 --> 00:44:58.233]  It's like the gay men in the Times of London article and in the Rolling Stone article.
[00:44:58.593 --> 00:44:59.634]  They want AIDS.
[00:44:59.674 --> 00:45:00.715]  They want to catch it.
[00:45:00.955 --> 00:45:02.777]  A third of the gay men in San Francisco.
[00:45:04.919 --> 00:45:06.500]  I mean, I feel sorry for those people.
[00:45:07.481 --> 00:45:08.282]  I pray for them.
[00:45:08.342 --> 00:45:08.602]  What?
[00:45:08.862 --> 00:45:10.624]  And now the women want to be like that.
[00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:17.650]  All right, folks, let's go to some more calls.
[00:45:19.249 --> 00:45:21.250]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeffrey in Louisiana.
[00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:22.310]  Jeffrey, go ahead, sir.
[00:45:24.131 --> 00:45:25.151]  Yes, Alex, can you hear me?
[00:45:25.531 --> 00:45:26.951]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:27.952]  Oh, yes, I got you.
[00:45:28.012 --> 00:45:28.572]  Oh, excellent.
[00:45:28.852 --> 00:45:39.355]  First of all, I am sending you and have sent you two pieces of mail that concern a story you gave yesterday about the effect of the New World Order on blind people.
[00:45:40.075 --> 00:45:48.418]  One is a list of the computers and the devices that help blind people to read print directly from print to speech.
[00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:59.486]  The other, and I sent this this morning, is an article from the American Foundation for the Blind concerning four different voting machines that have been proposed so that blind people can vote by themselves.
[00:46:00.227 --> 00:46:01.568]  That article is on tape.
[00:46:02.269 --> 00:46:07.115]  Reason I've sent that is to show you that there is no satisfactory means
[00:46:07.717 --> 00:46:14.819]  By which the blind folks can have a secret ballot because there are various different problems with the sheets that have been proposed.
[00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:20.381]  Well, blind people should certainly be able to have family or friends go aid them.
[00:46:20.941 --> 00:46:22.422]  I think there should be a law on that.
[00:46:22.462 --> 00:46:23.522]  But let me add this point.
[00:46:24.022 --> 00:46:26.583]  For those that don't know, you're bringing up a story from yesterday, and it's a good point.
[00:46:26.643 --> 00:46:29.524]  I'll let you complete your comments, Jeffrey, but let me just give folks the preface.
[00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:39.620]  There's a federal suit in Florida because the touchscreens are basically impossible for a visually impaired person to be able to use them.
[00:46:40.241 --> 00:46:41.342]  This affects everybody, folks.
[00:46:41.402 --> 00:46:46.787]  Most of you are going to end up blind if you're lucky enough to live long enough, or basically blind.
[00:46:47.267 --> 00:46:55.315]  This is a terrible thing that's happening, but the point I was making is there should be lawsuits over the touchscreens defrauding everybody.
[00:46:55.795 --> 00:47:06.864]  Instead of it just being the Americans with Disabilities Act, then I added that they're going to use it to selectively shut down websites and newspapers because they're arresting folks now in England if anything on their website isn't accessible by the blind.
[00:47:07.085 --> 00:47:11.768]  Well, a lot of folks don't have the personnel or the money to have a site that's totally accessible by the blind.
[00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:18.494]  So that's why I got into that discussion, how the government, in the name of helping those that are in need, really is out censoring people.
[00:47:18.514 --> 00:47:18.834]  Go ahead.
[00:47:19.095 --> 00:47:20.616]  It's even worse than that, Alex.
[00:47:21.076 --> 00:47:23.178]  We have a lot of blind listeners and
[00:47:47.253 --> 00:47:54.357]  It's incredible to watch this happen, and yeah, how they want to keep you guys in that box.
[00:47:57.719 --> 00:47:58.539]  Go ahead, Jeffrey.
[00:47:58.679 --> 00:48:11.626]  Although the voting machines have various approaches to allowing blind people to vote, they've been found to be unsatisfactory in that they can be censored by the government or tampered by the government in many ways.
[00:48:12.387 --> 00:48:16.209]  But as I say, when you get these pieces of mail, you'll be able to post them on Infowars.com.
[00:48:17.316 --> 00:48:18.997]  Hopefully, I'll be able to do that.
[00:48:19.717 --> 00:48:21.098]  Anything else on your mind, Jeffrey?
[00:48:21.438 --> 00:48:22.199]  Well, one other thing.
[00:48:22.519 --> 00:48:22.859]  Stay there.
[00:48:22.879 --> 00:48:23.880]  I'll let you finish on the other side.
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.221]  Then we'll go to Mark and everybody else.
[00:48:26.241 --> 00:48:27.922]  So stay with me and fullwars.com.
[00:48:31.304 --> 00:48:35.647]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:48:35.827 --> 00:48:40.249]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:48:40.409 --> 00:48:44.812]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:48:44.852 --> 00:48:46.173]  The New World Order.
[00:48:47.953 --> 00:48:52.174]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:48:52.234 --> 00:48:59.156]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:48:59.296 --> 00:49:01.357]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:49:01.537 --> 00:49:12.139]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:49:12.299 --> 00:49:15.060]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:15.140]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.102]  Order today and spread the word.

[00:49:40.804 --> 00:49:51.166]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:49:51.326 --> 00:49:55.666]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:55.866 --> 00:49:59.567]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine
[00:49:59.687 --> 00:50:04.228]  Benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:50:04.489 --> 00:50:10.871]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:50:10.971 --> 00:50:15.452]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave them the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[00:50:26.535 --> 00:50:28.596]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:50:28.816 --> 00:50:31.397]  Oh my God!
[00:50:31.657 --> 00:50:36.358]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:50:36.658 --> 00:50:37.338]  Yes, it's true.
[00:50:37.418 --> 00:50:40.099]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:50:40.239 --> 00:50:44.280]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:44.961]  You heard it right.
[00:50:45.121 --> 00:50:50.102]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:50:50.222 --> 00:50:50.682]  We're good to go.
[00:51:20.162 --> 00:51:21.043]  We're good to go.
[00:51:21.123 --> 00:51:22.083]  We're good to go.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.161]  We're back live.
[00:51:48.181 --> 00:51:48.821]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:51:48.961 --> 00:51:53.785]  Second hour and I will launch into more of the key news and of course your calls coming up.
[00:51:54.225 --> 00:52:02.392]  Let's go back to Jeffrey in Louisiana who is talking about issues relating to folks that have trouble seeing.
[00:52:02.432 --> 00:52:02.792]  Go ahead.
[00:52:04.653 --> 00:52:05.734]  We're going to finish up a point.
[00:52:06.955 --> 00:52:13.360]  WWRB is being jammed at times on 12.172 and 9.320 in the daytime.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.563]  I've been listening to it and somebody is putting white noise on the
[00:52:17.105 --> 00:52:29.994]  I know, and it's another one of the efforts to try to keep people like me in line and prevent us from knowing about things, but it's too late for me because I've been in the Bird Society for 29 years and we're having a celebration of the 45th anniversary of that organization in Appleton, Wisconsin on October the 25th.
[00:52:46.088 --> 00:52:47.229]  15th through the 19th.
[00:52:47.949 --> 00:52:50.830]  So I just wanted to let you all know that that's going to happen.
[00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:55.912]  If I get a chance, I might report to you guys as things develop in Appleton during that time.
[00:52:56.012 --> 00:52:57.053]  All right, fantastic.
[00:52:57.113 --> 00:53:01.574]  Of course, Joseph McCarthy is also from there in Wisconsin.
[00:53:01.834 --> 00:53:02.315]  Absolutely.
[00:53:02.355 --> 00:53:07.057]  That's why the Berkshires had their headquarters in Appleton, because that's where he was born in Appleton.
[00:53:07.077 --> 00:53:07.897]  That's where his tomb is.
[00:53:09.198 --> 00:53:11.721]  So I'll let you go at this point and let other callers come in.
[00:53:11.961 --> 00:53:12.982]  All right, thanks a lot.
[00:53:13.283 --> 00:53:28.040]  And for those that just heard that and got all angry, our little brainwashed lefties out there, who were basically buddies with George Bush and didn't know it, the KGB files have been released, even the LA Times had the headline, McCarthy was right, it was worse than he thought.
[00:53:28.812 --> 00:53:43.268]  See, when he found out the army was running the Soviet Union, when he found out that the communists were run from a level in the National Security Agency, when he found out there was a level above communism, that it was run by the bankers, that's when they deep-sixed him.
[00:53:43.688 --> 00:53:44.790]  That's when they went after him.
[00:53:46.371 --> 00:53:48.293]  That's the historical fact of...
[00:53:49.998 --> 00:53:50.899]  Joseph McCarthy.
[00:53:50.919 --> 00:53:52.460]  Because it isn't communism.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:57.305]  And when he got sophisticated enough, he was already very sophisticated for the 1950s.
[00:53:57.745 --> 00:54:01.468]  He was a Marine Corps aviator, a veteran, a great patriot, a great man.
[00:54:02.329 --> 00:54:05.392]  And let me tell you, the stuff you see and hear about him is a lie.
[00:54:05.632 --> 00:54:08.375]  When you actually know the real history, it is ridiculous.
[00:54:09.816 --> 00:54:10.877]  It is unbelievable.
[00:54:11.337 --> 00:54:14.000]  The lies that have been told about Senator Joseph McCarthy.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.261]  I'm sick of it.
[00:54:16.368 --> 00:54:29.438]  But when he found out that it was a level above and it was the Secretary of the Army, well, now that's on the History Channel that they put Mao into power in 1949, that Marshall did it.
[00:54:29.698 --> 00:54:31.439]  This is all admitted now, folks.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:35.602]  Everything McCarthy said is mainstream History Channel now.
[00:54:35.762 --> 00:54:39.105]  But just like it's fun, oh, we put Mao in.
[00:54:39.365 --> 00:54:41.086]  He killed 50 million people.
[00:54:41.346 --> 00:54:42.067]  It isn't funny.
[00:54:42.742 --> 00:54:49.406]  So next time somebody puts down McCarthy, you tell them, hey, it's people like you that helped kill 50 million people by your ignorance, you trash.
[00:54:51.328 --> 00:54:55.270]  I tell you, this really upsets me, because we don't stand up that this is going to happen here, folks, okay?
[00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:57.572]  The back of my neck, the hair is standing up.
[00:54:58.392 --> 00:55:08.659]  Before I end this hour and come back with more calls and more news, you want to support us, you believe in what we're doing, you want to get powerful tools that will wake people up like none other, get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, frankly, my best film.
[00:55:08.679 --> 00:55:11.461]  My newest film is excellent as well, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:55:12.563 --> 00:55:24.134]  Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, government-run white slavery rings, gun control, forced inoculations, PNAC, the New World Order, the phony left-right paradigm, it's all exposed in that new film.
[00:55:25.075 --> 00:55:26.977]  The new book I've published, Order Out of Chaos, is 1995.
[00:55:27.037 --> 00:55:27.417]  It's excellent.
[00:55:29.821 --> 00:55:31.963]  Elite sponsor, Terror in the New World Order by Paul Watson.
[00:55:32.244 --> 00:55:34.206]  Get a second copy for $12 as a gift.

[00:56:04.236 --> 00:56:05.057]  Keep it locked in.
[00:56:05.117 --> 00:56:06.257]  Stay the course.
[00:56:21.547 --> 00:56:23.669]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.253 --> 00:56:47.893]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.554 --> 00:56:49.614]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.315 --> 00:56:51.435]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:52.896]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.656 --> 00:56:54.577]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.237 --> 00:56:58.879]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.399 --> 00:57:03.541]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:06.743 --> 00:57:07.343]  I'm angry.
[00:57:08.304 --> 00:57:09.124]  I'm fired up.
[00:57:09.604 --> 00:57:13.886]  I'm upset about what's happening in the world today, what the New World Order is up to.
[00:57:14.346 --> 00:57:15.267]  And I want to fight them.
[00:57:16.306 --> 00:57:24.588]  I want humanity to wake up to the human struggle against tyranny that's gone on since ancient times.
[00:57:25.468 --> 00:57:35.491]  I want to convince the yuppies out there that they have a stake in understanding that government has always been corrupt and has always been the most dangerous thing that free peoples face.
[00:57:36.751 --> 00:57:37.612]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:37.652 --> 00:57:42.973]  We're now into the second hour of this worldwide transmission.
[00:57:43.837 --> 00:57:54.381]  On this 24th of September, 2003 broadcast, we do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day, and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:57:54.401 --> 00:57:56.922]  I know we have loaded phones here.
[00:57:56.942 --> 00:58:03.005]  We're going to be going to Mark and Don and Ron and Charles and Scott and others.
[00:58:03.705 --> 00:58:05.806]  It's always nice to hear from some females as well.
[00:58:05.826 --> 00:58:06.966]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:58:11.897 --> 00:58:16.840]  All right, it's come out that Arnold was involved in more than just gay magazines, homosexual magazines.
[00:58:16.921 --> 00:58:23.445]  Now it turns out that he's in the private collection of some of the wealthy perverts.
[00:58:23.965 --> 00:58:26.367]  And this has already come out years before.
[00:58:26.487 --> 00:58:31.711]  But I say this means he'll even get a bigger endorsement by the Republican Party and Christian right leaders.
[00:58:32.313 --> 00:58:48.900]  Because if you don't own racehorses, if you don't spend a million for on gambling and have prostitutes, if you don't go to the Bohemian Grove to engage in satanic rituals, you're not a real Christian conservative, according to the news.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:56.663]  If you really do love Jesus and you love the sovereignty of this country and you care about the Second Amendment, you're a communist.
[00:58:57.403 --> 00:58:58.624]  And I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:58:58.664 --> 00:58:59.524]  This is the new system.
[00:59:00.808 --> 00:59:02.649]  You know, terms change, folks.
[00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:03.950]  And so I'm a communist.
[00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:05.271]  I mean, I've got to be honest about it.
[00:59:05.751 --> 00:59:07.072]  I hate socialization.
[00:59:07.192 --> 00:59:08.093]  I hate big government.
[00:59:08.153 --> 00:59:09.274]  I hate Stalin.
[00:59:09.314 --> 00:59:09.934]  I'm a communist.
[00:59:10.414 --> 00:59:13.096]  You're a good conservative if you love Mao and Lenin and Che Guevara.
[00:59:13.637 --> 00:59:14.757]  They were good capitalists.
[00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:16.659]  Now you're thinking, oh, you're being sarcastic.
[00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:16.979]  No.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:27.926]  Earlier last year in the BBC, Jiang Zemin, outgoing communist dictator, president, said capitalism is the greatest form of communism.
[00:59:29.016 --> 00:59:30.156]  People said, why did he say that?
[00:59:30.176 --> 00:59:31.477]  Well, because it's true.
[00:59:31.557 --> 00:59:32.957]  Capitalism isn't free market.
[00:59:33.137 --> 00:59:34.777]  It's another form of command and control.
[00:59:35.218 --> 00:59:36.938]  The capitalists created communism.
[00:59:36.978 --> 00:59:37.738]  They spawned it.
[00:59:38.598 --> 00:59:40.799]  If you can't figure that out, well, we'll get more into it.
[00:59:41.219 --> 00:59:46.440]  So we'll get into the recall election, and California's back on the table right now.
[00:59:47.741 --> 00:59:48.961]  Back on the table.
[00:59:50.402 --> 01:00:01.649]  For the 7th of October, and again, it doesn't matter how anti-gun or pro-abortion Arnold is, he's going to get endorsed by the socialist whore Limbaugh and all of their minions and pomps.
[01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:04.211]  So we'll get into that.
[01:00:04.932 --> 01:00:08.894]  Also, troops were harassing families, pulling them out of cars at checkpoints.
[01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:10.575]  Foreign troops in Scotland.
[01:00:12.556 --> 01:00:16.239]  Scotland hasn't been invaded in hundreds of years, and last time it happened, it was the British.
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.701]  But now they've been invaded by, of course, Eastern Bloc troops, and that's BBC.
[01:00:21.041 --> 01:00:22.021]  We've been invaded here.
[01:00:22.061 --> 01:00:24.161]  It's all part of conditioning and probing.
[01:00:24.361 --> 01:00:26.042]  We'll get into some of the foreign troop movements.
[01:00:27.102 --> 01:00:28.522]  Also, terror group under U.S.
[01:00:28.562 --> 01:00:31.283]  protection, and that's out of the News Observer.
[01:00:31.303 --> 01:00:36.864]  Of course, yesterday it was the BBC with the Germans protecting Al-Qaeda because it turned out they were CIA.
[01:00:37.144 --> 01:00:41.605]  More staged arrests of so-called terrorists by Musarif, and Pakistan turns out they're CIA.
[01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:44.463]  It goes on and on.
[01:00:44.543 --> 01:00:47.727]  So a lot of key news in this hour.
[01:00:47.827 --> 01:00:51.552]  But first, when we get back, I'm going to go to all these great folks.
[01:00:51.572 --> 01:00:54.716]  Try to go to you as quickly as possible today.

[01:01:06.756 --> 01:01:08.657]  You'll definitely want to spread the word and check them out today.
[01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:14.221]  And help me expose Arnold Schwarzenegger as the neocon big government pimp that he is.
[01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:16.543]  I'm sorry, whore that he is.
[01:01:18.544 --> 01:01:18.965]  Help us.
[01:01:19.485 --> 01:01:22.347]  Go get the article I wrote about him, the most detailed I've seen out there.
[01:01:22.707 --> 01:01:23.768]  Email it out to everybody.
[01:01:25.188 --> 01:01:28.313]  The headline is, New Order Elite has big plans for Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:01:28.854 --> 01:01:29.775]  Email that out to everybody.
[01:01:30.055 --> 01:01:31.177]  Post it on the news groups.
[01:01:32.139 --> 01:01:33.300]  Send it to Rents and others.
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.062]  Get them to post it.
[01:01:34.082 --> 01:01:39.430]  Because people need to know, this is a great way to expose what George Bush and his people really are.
[01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:44.299]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[01:01:44.519 --> 01:01:47.360]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?

[01:02:01.525 --> 01:02:02.085]  We're good to go.

[01:02:37.423 --> 01:02:46.908]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:47.088 --> 01:02:51.530]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:52.911]  There is a chance.
[01:02:53.411 --> 01:02:56.052]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:58.813]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:02:59.213 --> 01:03:03.415]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:03:03.495 --> 01:03:10.418]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:03:10.558 --> 01:03:12.559]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:03:12.779 --> 01:03:23.327]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:03:23.547 --> 01:03:28.951]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:03:43.842 --> 01:03:49.584]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:03:49.844 --> 01:03:54.966]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:03:55.306 --> 01:04:02.989]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon,
[01:04:03.469 --> 01:04:14.259]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:04:14.439 --> 01:04:19.183]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:04:19.563 --> 01:04:25.550]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:04:42.418 --> 01:04:50.124]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:04:50.144 --> 01:04:56.028]  All right, let me cover this one article, and then I promise I'll go straight to your calls.
[01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:59.191]  This is out of the BBC today.
[01:04:59.211 --> 01:05:02.213]  It's on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:05:02.393 --> 01:05:09.518]  And before I read this article, I just want to remind you that in my films, The Takeover and Road to Tyranny and Police State 2000,
[01:05:11.295 --> 01:05:12.436]  I have video of U.S.
[01:05:12.536 --> 01:05:17.458]  Army troops running checkpoints in Texas, in California, in Maryland.
[01:05:18.078 --> 01:05:20.559]  They pull families out of cars in North Carolina.
[01:05:21.199 --> 01:05:22.400]  They take people to jail.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.561]  They shove women around.
[01:05:26.742 --> 01:05:31.223]  I've got news articles, not just video, but stuff out of Tennessee where they had U.S.
[01:05:31.303 --> 01:05:31.784]  Army out.
[01:05:31.804 --> 01:05:35.345]  They grabbed everybody out, put their boots on their heads, looking for drugs.
[01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:39.547]  This was before 9-11, okay, that they were getting rid of posse commentatus before that.
[01:05:40.896 --> 01:05:48.680]  And in about 30% of the cases, and we've seen hundreds of these around the country, we've been to dozens on the ground, there will be foreign troops.
[01:05:48.961 --> 01:06:09.052]  And in every case, if they're off base, they are Czech Republic, they are Russian, they could even be from Belarus, Tajikistan, Pakistan, they will be from Ukraine, occasionally Israeli, French, British, Australian, but generally...
[01:06:10.314 --> 01:06:13.815]  Sometimes Chinese, but that's only on base with role players.
[01:06:15.676 --> 01:06:22.099]  And they'll admit, this is for the U.S., this is for emergencies, they're going to bring foreign troops in, we have the Army War College, we have the Associated Press.
[01:06:22.119 --> 01:06:23.499]  This has been set up since 1999.
[01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:24.920]  Publicly.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.861]  So then when you read an article like this, just listen to this article, okay?
[01:06:30.001 --> 01:06:32.642]  And this is going on in London, this is going on all over.
[01:06:32.682 --> 01:06:34.523]  They're training people to put up with this.
[01:06:34.543 --> 01:06:37.444]  Now notice, in England they're getting mad about national ID cards.
[01:06:37.544 --> 01:06:39.085]  Not here, we're just accepting it like idiots.
[01:06:39.705 --> 01:06:42.166]  They get upset about Cripps pointing guns at their family over there.
[01:06:44.046 --> 01:06:45.447]  We're so desensitized here.
[01:06:45.567 --> 01:06:48.508]  Oh, you're weird if you don't like the Army grabbing your wife out of the car.
[01:06:50.908 --> 01:06:53.409]  When they took over, you know, areas of Ohio.
[01:06:54.909 --> 01:06:56.670]  Remember, that was in the Ohio newspapers.
[01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:59.371]  Ukrainian Marines stop drivers.
[01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:07.713]  An apology has been issued to civilians caught up in an incident involving armed soldiers taking part in a NATO exercise in South Africa.
[01:07:08.542 --> 01:07:09.403]  West Scotland.
[01:07:09.743 --> 01:07:13.726]  Now notice, it's always an exercise, it's always a drill, like all the fake bio-attacks and stuff.
[01:07:13.946 --> 01:07:15.767]  Before 9-11, getting you used to this.
[01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:25.814]  Motorists using a public road in Wigtownshire were forced to stop by Ukrainian Marines acting with French soldiers.
[01:07:27.275 --> 01:07:31.598]  The events took place during an amphibious landing exercise at Loose Bay on Saturday.
[01:07:32.218 --> 01:07:36.902]  Two armed Ukrainian Marines involved in a mock hunt for terrorists, if they say two, try 5,000.
[01:07:38.269 --> 01:07:43.295]  I had forced a number of vehicles on the coastal road near Port William to pull over.
[01:07:43.655 --> 01:07:44.676]  Oh, two Marines did that.
[01:07:45.637 --> 01:07:47.099]  I got other articles here out of Scotland.
[01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:47.960]  It was a lot more than that.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:48.901]  It was hundreds, folks.
[01:07:48.921 --> 01:07:49.922]  There were thousands involved.
[01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:55.969]  One driver who had been unaware of the NATO exercise had children in the car, and so they were left deeply distressed by the incident.
[01:07:56.644 --> 01:07:59.064]  Folks, what are you going to do if foreign troops stop you at a checkpoint?
[01:07:59.285 --> 01:08:01.585]  You going to go ahead and let them put you in the paddy wagon?
[01:08:01.605 --> 01:08:05.846]  You going to go ahead and... See, they do these drills all the time until it's real, see?
[01:08:06.106 --> 01:08:06.886]  And you hesitate.
[01:08:06.906 --> 01:08:11.387]  The local police hesitate just long enough for them to take over all your police departments, everything.
[01:08:11.607 --> 01:08:12.807]  And don't think they won't do it.
[01:08:12.967 --> 01:08:19.668]  The globalists have a plan to inject hundreds of thousands of foreign troops in here and take over every police station, everything.
[01:08:20.208 --> 01:08:23.389]  And most of your mayors and police are going to go along with it, just like in Red Dawn.
[01:08:23.909 --> 01:08:24.730]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:29.474]  This is an official Army War College plan to have Russians occupy America.
[01:08:30.275 --> 01:08:31.616]  Colonel Roberts has talked about this.
[01:08:31.656 --> 01:08:40.824]  They were taught some of this in their exercises when he was in his officer training in the 80s when he was going on to be a colonel.
[01:08:43.026 --> 01:08:43.967]  This is so insane.
[01:08:44.227 --> 01:08:49.772]  One driver who had been unaware of the NATO exercise had children in the car and said they were left deeply distressed by the incident.
[01:08:50.555 --> 01:08:56.659]  Major John Pullum, an ATO exercise commander, confirmed that the complaints had been made and immediate action had been taken.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.962]  Major Pullum said all troops involved had been given clear instructions not to engage civilians at any time.
[01:09:01.343 --> 01:09:02.644]  This is just part of acclimation.
[01:09:03.164 --> 01:09:11.610]  I think in this case we had a situation where we had some troops that were unfamiliar with the surroundings and possibly became overzealous in their application of what they were required to do, he said.
[01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:18.355]  We subsequently followed up by speaking to the commanding officer of the unit concerned and reiterating those instructions that were in place.
[01:09:19.036 --> 01:09:20.079]  Entirely unacceptable.
[01:09:20.119 --> 01:09:22.866]  He added that full review of the incident was underway.
[01:09:23.307 --> 01:09:27.498]  Alex Ferguson, the MSP for Yalloway, an upper...
[01:09:28.488 --> 01:09:32.051]  Netsdale said that he was deeply disturbed by the incident.
[01:09:32.491 --> 01:09:40.116]  This must have been a terrifying ordeal for some people who were simply enjoying a drive in the countryside, especially for young children involved, said Mr. Ferguson.
[01:09:40.556 --> 01:09:41.417]  I think it's unacceptable.
[01:09:41.457 --> 01:09:42.738]  This sort of thing should happen.
[01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:48.422]  And I think there are urgent investigations within the armed forces and MOD and indeed NATO itself.
[01:09:48.482 --> 01:09:50.143]  It is entirely acceptable in any type of form.
[01:09:50.703 --> 01:09:51.584]  Now, that's the whitewash.
[01:09:51.624 --> 01:09:53.706]  I got other articles out of Scotland itself.
[01:09:54.046 --> 01:09:57.729]  They were pulling people out of cars, putting guns in their heads, the stuff they do.
[01:09:57.789 --> 01:10:00.431]  Now, here they do this in almost every public school with your children.
[01:10:00.851 --> 01:10:02.913]  Guys in black ski masks, they use profanity.
[01:10:03.434 --> 01:10:07.337]  In Fort Worth two years ago, they shot cop of the year in the face during a drill in front of kids.
[01:10:07.557 --> 01:10:11.420]  They shot a child in the face last year in Detroit during these drills.
[01:10:12.361 --> 01:10:14.142]  A few months ago, they shot some other child.
[01:10:14.242 --> 01:10:14.943]  A gun went off.
[01:10:15.543 --> 01:10:16.184]  Where was that?
[01:10:16.204 --> 01:10:17.545]  I forget.
[01:10:17.605 --> 01:10:18.446]  So many of these articles.
[01:10:19.602 --> 01:10:20.862]  You've heard about it in your news.
[01:10:21.783 --> 01:10:25.044]  Dragging little kids around, elementary school students loading them on buses.
[01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:27.105]  That's just normal!
[01:10:28.445 --> 01:10:30.266]  Let me just add this final point here.
[01:10:31.006 --> 01:10:33.447]  And this is in, by the way, this is in the Masters of Terror.
[01:10:34.547 --> 01:10:36.668]  And I believe we did a little clip in Road to Tyranny, didn't we?
[01:10:36.828 --> 01:10:37.688]  Yes, yes we did.
[01:10:37.988 --> 01:10:38.669]  Some of the articles.
[01:10:39.629 --> 01:10:48.452]  In early 2002, remember, two separate incidents of soldiers 50 miles away and 40 miles away trying to take over squad cars.
[01:10:50.367 --> 01:10:53.308]  Now, later Fort Bragg admitted, well, there were no drills with squad cars.
[01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:55.009]  See, it's test.
[01:10:55.049 --> 01:10:59.291]  These troops are told, go in there and take down that cop.
[01:11:00.031 --> 01:11:04.073]  And when they pulled guns on the police officer, he had a lot more experience than they did in one case.
[01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:05.893]  Shot and killed one, injured the other.
[01:11:05.933 --> 01:11:07.294]  Other case, they blew one on the way.
[01:11:08.094 --> 01:11:11.856]  I mean, you know, these young guys pull their loaded guns, and then the cops kill them!
[01:11:15.277 --> 01:11:17.918]  And, you know, and you're like, well, don't be down on our troops.
[01:11:17.978 --> 01:11:20.259]  Oh, yeah, Delta Force came back and killed four of their wives.
[01:11:20.299 --> 01:11:22.220]  I mean, these guys have been, they're testing them.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.381]  They're testing drugs on them.
[01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:27.741]  This is all part of acclimation, see?
[01:11:28.042 --> 01:11:35.584]  When this all first started in the early 90s, towns would get hit by black helicopters, troops would run around, take over cities, parts of cities, and then it'd be on the news.
[01:11:36.084 --> 01:11:40.146]  Well, a conspiracy theorist said they saw some black helicopters or it'd be smoking buildings.
[01:11:40.426 --> 01:11:41.406]  It's a conspiracy later.
[01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:43.227]  They said, okay, it's really happening, and
[01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:46.983]  So this is happening all over the place, folks.
[01:11:47.063 --> 01:11:48.224]  It's very scary.
[01:11:48.585 --> 01:11:52.208]  And NATO had its AWACS in our skies, the 56 Norwegian F-16s.
[01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.989]  Remember that?
[01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:59.516]  They said in 1999, quote, we want Mexican and Canadian troops to, quote, deal with American terrorists and for peacekeeping.
[01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:03.939]  The fires in 99 that Clinton admits they set out west.
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:05.640]  They set them.
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.061]  The government admits they set them.
[01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:07.441]  Remember that?
[01:12:07.701 --> 01:12:08.981]  John Stossel even did a report.
[01:12:09.342 --> 01:12:10.222]  Then they call in U.N.
[01:12:10.262 --> 01:12:11.302]  troops and the Army.
[01:12:11.803 --> 01:12:13.283]  All part of training you.
[01:12:13.383 --> 01:12:14.904]  It's happening.
[01:12:17.045 --> 01:12:18.165]  It's happening, folks.
[01:12:20.146 --> 01:12:22.507]  And now these checkpoints around the country, it'll be in the newspaper.
[01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:24.888]  Well, there were some foreign troops there helping out.
[01:12:24.928 --> 01:12:27.329]  They're part of the NATO exchange.
[01:12:29.218 --> 01:12:30.039]  This is being done.
[01:12:30.059 --> 01:12:33.682]  See, next time the folks in Scotland won't be as upset.
[01:12:33.722 --> 01:12:35.223]  Well, that's just what they do, see.
[01:12:36.804 --> 01:12:41.928]  These are very genteel people who were offended by police with guns.
[01:12:41.948 --> 01:12:44.290]  Now it's Eastern Bloc troops.
[01:12:45.871 --> 01:12:46.572]  All right.
[01:12:47.413 --> 01:12:50.635]  Don in New York, then Ron, Charles, Scott, and others.
[01:12:50.675 --> 01:12:51.296]  Don, go ahead.
[01:12:53.339 --> 01:12:53.740]  Yes, sir.
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:54.761]  North Carolina.
[01:12:55.001 --> 01:12:55.841]  Okay, you're in North Carolina.
[01:12:55.861 --> 01:12:56.282]  I'm sorry.
[01:12:56.502 --> 01:12:57.182]  Hi, Alex.
[01:12:57.743 --> 01:13:03.027]  I just wanted to comment, brought up the information yesterday on JetBlue.
[01:13:04.268 --> 01:13:07.490]  Oh, yeah, the airlines uploading information to the Army.
[01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:09.252]  Yeah, I'll tell you a little bit about them.
[01:13:09.272 --> 01:13:10.573]  I'm an employee for U.S.
[01:13:10.733 --> 01:13:16.137]  Airways, and our company has two Rothschilds on our board of directors.
[01:13:18.453 --> 01:13:22.216]  Sir, sir, the Southern Poverty Law Center says that that doesn't exist.
[01:13:22.276 --> 01:13:23.777]  If you say it, that's a code word.
[01:13:24.158 --> 01:13:28.742]  Rothschilds don't exist even when they're in the BBC intermarrying with the royal family and people.
[01:13:28.882 --> 01:13:32.245]  Well, the director of Rothschild North America sits on the board at U.S.
[01:13:32.345 --> 01:13:32.685]  Airways.
[01:13:32.965 --> 01:13:33.706]  They don't exist.
[01:13:33.746 --> 01:13:34.967]  The New World Order doesn't exist.
[01:13:35.308 --> 01:13:35.788]  The U.N.
[01:13:35.808 --> 01:13:36.469]  doesn't exist.
[01:13:36.649 --> 01:13:38.370]  The International Criminal Court doesn't exist.
[01:13:38.611 --> 01:13:39.551]  Rush Limbaugh said.
[01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:40.152]  Right.
[01:13:40.332 --> 01:13:42.294]  A lot of people think that because they don't read.
[01:13:44.333 --> 01:13:51.255]  Back to JetBlue, I don't know if you're familiar with them, but Chuckie Schumer was instrumental in getting them up and running in New York.
[01:13:52.156 --> 01:13:55.757]  And also, George Soros is the big backer of that airline.
[01:13:55.837 --> 01:13:57.717]  I don't know if you're aware of that.
[01:13:57.737 --> 01:14:00.078]  Yeah, who acts like he's against Bush.
[01:14:00.138 --> 01:14:03.459]  Yeah, he's listed under Quantum Industrial Partners.
[01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:05.980]  It's on their own 10K data.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:06.960]  George Soros is an...
[01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:12.901]  Admitted Rothschild agent, just like Warren Buffett, and very interesting.
[01:14:13.121 --> 01:14:15.922]  Yeah, he has another partner, and he's right out of the CFR.
[01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:20.145]  But anyway, this company, it's Quantum Industrial Partners.
[01:14:20.185 --> 01:14:23.566]  That's where he ducks and hides under this JetBlue.
[01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:28.449]  It's actually located, I have the address, it's in the Netherlands, Antilles.
[01:14:29.747 --> 01:14:30.127]  K.F.
[01:14:30.207 --> 01:14:34.729]  Lamboy and Nine will instead Caraco, Netherlands, and Chile.
[01:14:35.809 --> 01:14:37.069]  Everything's owned by Europe.
[01:14:37.089 --> 01:14:38.110]  We're absolute slaves.
[01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:42.991]  They're using us to take over countries and then blaming America when America's just a fist.
[01:14:43.411 --> 01:14:47.592]  And everybody just wants to watch West Wing, or everybody loves Raymond.
[01:14:48.093 --> 01:14:50.693]  But Sorrel owns 15% of the company.
[01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:54.174]  Fidelity Investments is also a big player.
[01:14:54.194 --> 01:14:54.675]  They own like 13%.
[01:14:56.733 --> 01:15:02.097]  And the CEO, he's incorporated himself, so he can duck and hide and not pay taxes there.
[01:15:02.978 --> 01:15:06.260]  But going back to... Oh, yeah, the big corporations don't pay taxes.
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:06.760]  We have.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.761]  They're all... U.S.
[01:15:07.841 --> 01:15:09.983]  Airways is adding flights all down into the Caribbean.
[01:15:10.383 --> 01:15:14.586]  But, you know, they have a new board of directors, and this man, I'll tell you his name.
[01:15:14.606 --> 01:15:17.188]  His name is James Simon, Jr.
[01:15:17.848 --> 01:15:20.090]  He was assistant director of the CIA for 28 years.
[01:15:22.082 --> 01:15:31.204]  And he, after September 11th... Yeah, sir, you don't get a job at the Stock Exchange as a director or in the, you know, the head of ABC or whatever unless you were in the CIA.
[01:15:31.284 --> 01:15:32.845]  Yeah, or a Freemason.
[01:15:33.865 --> 01:15:39.546]  And this man, he chaired the Homeland Security Intelligence Council right after September 11th.
[01:15:39.906 --> 01:15:46.628]  But the interesting thing... Yeah, and I watched that council with Ridge, and they said to have a job, you're going to have to have clearance, a job anywhere.
[01:15:46.668 --> 01:15:49.569]  We're going to be total slaves, and isn't that interesting that he's CIA?
[01:15:49.589 --> 01:15:51.069]  Not me, I'm not a slave, but...
[01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:58.231]  The other thing is, is this Mr. Simon, he sits on a board of a company right there in Austin called United Defenses.
[01:15:58.631 --> 01:15:59.351]  Uh-huh, yeah.
[01:15:59.592 --> 01:16:05.075]  And they're into intelligence and homeland security issues, and they're in all of these technologies.
[01:16:05.135 --> 01:16:07.356]  Well, let's just call it slave mastering.
[01:16:07.836 --> 01:16:08.096]  Yeah.
[01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:10.718]  And the final thing I wanted to point out...
[01:16:11.781 --> 01:16:14.922]  All the airlines are basically just full of these parasites.
[01:16:15.082 --> 01:16:20.404]  In fact, if you go to Halliburton, you'll find Robert Crandall, the ex-CEO of American Airlines.
[01:16:20.424 --> 01:16:21.945]  Oh, yeah, they're giant cash machines.
[01:16:21.985 --> 01:16:22.205]  Look.
[01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:23.426]  Yeah, yeah, he's got his big heart.
[01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:24.386]  Hey, hey, bud, bud.
[01:16:24.706 --> 01:16:33.349]  The $25 billion the airlines got paid, all the top 10 could have run for four or five years off that without making a dollar, and they just made a profit bigger.
[01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:36.231]  Then they claim they're not making profits and lay everybody off.
[01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.211]  It's a total scam.
[01:16:37.531 --> 01:16:38.131]  Great points.
[01:16:38.171 --> 01:16:39.692]  More calls, more news coming up.
[01:16:42.634 --> 01:16:44.215]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:16:44.595 --> 01:16:50.337]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:16:50.597 --> 01:16:55.719]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:16:56.059 --> 01:17:05.343]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:17:05.703 --> 01:17:10.646]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:17:10.966 --> 01:17:15.008]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:17:15.188 --> 01:17:19.951]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:26.214]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:17:26.574 --> 01:17:31.678]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and call them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:18:48.774 --> 01:18:49.674]  It still is.
[01:18:50.274 --> 01:18:53.776]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:18:54.097 --> 01:18:55.877]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:18:56.458 --> 01:18:58.519]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:18:59.079 --> 01:19:01.080]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:19:01.481 --> 01:19:09.125]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[01:19:09.525 --> 01:19:13.247]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[01:19:42.707 --> 01:19:47.409]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:48.369]  Yes, it's true.

[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.161]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[01:20:45.277 --> 01:20:51.302]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:20:51.922 --> 01:20:54.904]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:57.486 --> 01:20:59.668]  All right, Ron in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:20:59.728 --> 01:21:00.208]  Go ahead.
[01:21:00.769 --> 01:21:02.270]  Alex, I have several things here.
[01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:03.691]  I'll try to make it fast.
[01:21:04.211 --> 01:21:08.334]  First thing, I'll have a message with a friend, a blind friend named Chris.
[01:21:08.815 --> 01:21:12.958]  He's a computer science student, a genius, and if he calls you, let him talk.
[01:21:12.998 --> 01:21:14.559]  He can enlighten you on the subject matter.
[01:21:15.197 --> 01:21:20.100]  Of touch screens and blind people's access to websites.
[01:21:21.121 --> 01:21:42.714]  But also, Alex, here in Oklahoma, our enlightened legislature passed a law making it a felony, an anti-terrorism law, making it a felony to trespass on a hog farm with a camera in your possession or to take a reporter on this hog farm property to trespass if he has a camera.
[01:21:42.874 --> 01:21:44.675]  Now, let me stop you, Ron, because that's big.
[01:21:45.791 --> 01:21:53.954]  You're saying the newspaper's reporting that it's going to be an act of terrorism to gather news on these hog farms that are dumping all this horrible waste.
[01:21:53.994 --> 01:21:55.154]  It really is a problem, folks.
[01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:56.955]  Okay, now, Alex... Now, hold on.
[01:21:57.075 --> 01:21:57.975]  I hadn't heard about that.
[01:21:58.055 --> 01:22:04.277]  Tell me where I can find that so I can post it on the website, because I know that they're saying having one marijuana cigarette's going to be an act of terror.
[01:22:05.398 --> 01:22:06.238]  States are doing this.
[01:22:06.258 --> 01:22:07.278]  This is now all admitted.
[01:22:07.318 --> 01:22:08.419]  This is your Patriot Act.
[01:22:08.739 --> 01:22:09.579]  Tell me about this.
[01:22:10.199 --> 01:22:12.760]  Alex, they didn't... I never caught it in the newspaper.
[01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:14.521]  I heard...
[01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:30.955]  The lobbyists for the Oklahoma Pork Producers Association talking on our local Clear Channel talk radio station, KTOK 1000, on a talk program on a Sunday night, talking about this law.
[01:22:31.876 --> 01:22:32.276]  Okay?
[01:22:32.616 --> 01:22:35.657]  I have never found anything in the newspaper about it.
[01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:36.777]  I wouldn't know where to go.
[01:22:36.797 --> 01:22:37.858]  This was last spring.
[01:22:37.898 --> 01:22:39.538]  I've been to tell you about it several times.
[01:22:39.578 --> 01:22:41.859]  Well, I know the state law in Oregon said...
[01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:52.356]  Having a gun in your possession, period, downloading music, blocking traffic, you all get life in prison in a, quote, forest labor camp.
[01:22:52.616 --> 01:22:57.739]  Now, that's a real bill by the head of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Menace.
[01:22:57.799 --> 01:22:58.699]  That's really his name.
[01:22:58.719 --> 01:22:59.740]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:05.723]  So I've seen Stephen Magrits in Wisconsin got a bunch of prison time for suing a public official.
[01:23:06.023 --> 01:23:11.286]  They said, the state attorney said, that's an act of terror to sue a public official, quote, in the...
[01:23:12.353 --> 01:23:14.696]  In the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
[01:23:14.796 --> 01:23:16.257]  So, I believe it.
[01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:19.521]  Alex, I... Well, I'm kind of worried.
[01:23:19.621 --> 01:23:20.422]  I own a camera.
[01:23:20.442 --> 01:23:23.545]  Can I be arrested for possession of a terrorist weapon?
[01:23:24.326 --> 01:23:27.450]  They're trying to pass laws restricting filming police and others.
[01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:28.511]  We're a third world country.
[01:23:28.971 --> 01:23:33.196]  They're going to put cameras up and watch us and then selectively edit it when they do bad stuff.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:37.403]  But when we do stuff, they're going to use it against us.
[01:23:37.463 --> 01:23:45.590]  It's like the FEMA Command Center had footage of the Republican leadership in there controlling it to go after the Democrats when they left the state to Oklahoma.
[01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:51.035]  When they got caught violating federal law in doing that, they just said, oh, all the tapes didn't record that day.
[01:23:52.676 --> 01:23:53.657]  It's just incredible.
[01:23:54.317 --> 01:24:02.064]  Also, Alex, how much involvement did the Criminal Intelligence Agency have in the bombings in Iraq and the
[01:24:08.045 --> 01:24:09.245]  Well, the evidence is clear.
[01:24:09.265 --> 01:24:10.586]  The globalists are behind it.
[01:24:10.766 --> 01:24:15.807]  Even Chalibi, the terrorist bank robber they have running things there, bragged about it.
[01:24:15.867 --> 01:24:17.287]  Hey, UN, you're going to get bombed.
[01:24:17.787 --> 01:24:24.569]  And this is so the UN can come in and play the part as the martyr, and then come in as the good cop, and then America can be blamed as the bad cop.
[01:24:25.609 --> 01:24:31.053]  I mean, it's like when that Muslim sheik got killed, that imam from Iran.
[01:24:31.073 --> 01:24:35.476]  I mean, he was an Iranian agent, and the news said, looks like Iran killed him.
[01:24:35.556 --> 01:24:41.340]  I mean, that's so stupid, but people don't know where Iraq is on a map, so they just go, oh, Iran did it.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.623]  But no, no, the globalists don't want things to go well in Iraq.
[01:24:46.543 --> 01:24:48.444]  They want to foster all of this.
[01:24:48.925 --> 01:24:51.887]  That way they can then have the UN come in as the savior.
[01:24:52.167 --> 01:24:53.408]  So this is totally staged.
[01:24:53.648 --> 01:24:53.808]  Look,
[01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:54.981]  Believe me.
[01:24:55.982 --> 01:24:58.523]  They would find weapons of mass destruction in a second.
[01:24:58.583 --> 01:25:00.123]  Saddam had them all over the place.
[01:25:00.503 --> 01:25:04.245]  The problem is they were all declared sites marked Russian and U.S.
[01:25:04.945 --> 01:25:06.466]  from before the first Gulf War.
[01:25:06.526 --> 01:25:07.306]  That's admitted.
[01:25:07.346 --> 01:25:08.226]  That's the fine print.
[01:25:08.887 --> 01:25:10.967]  They could produce a fake weapons of mass destruction.
[01:25:11.187 --> 01:25:12.308]  They're not allowed to.
[01:25:12.668 --> 01:25:19.951]  They're meant to sit there and look bad and make America look bad, you understand, and make Europe look like the good cop when they really own America.
[01:25:24.321 --> 01:25:25.161]  Is that clear, Ron?
[01:25:25.922 --> 01:25:28.443]  Well, I see where you're coming from, right.
[01:25:28.543 --> 01:25:29.103]  I understand.
[01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:38.307]  I knew there had to be something behind these bombings in Iraq to set the United States
[01:25:39.187 --> 01:25:40.589]  Or to bring you in.
[01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:46.877]  Understand that also, if everything was freedom and happy and goodness, they'd have to pull the troops out.
[01:25:47.257 --> 01:25:49.600]  They wouldn't have an excuse to keep an occupation force in there.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:55.247]  Would Israel have an excuse to keep an occupation force in Palestine if the Palestinians weren't blowing stuff up?
[01:25:55.547 --> 01:25:55.767]  Right.
[01:25:55.807 --> 01:25:56.868]  I see where you're coming from.
[01:25:56.908 --> 01:25:59.089]  So it all goes back to having to have a boogeyman.
[01:26:19.233 --> 01:26:21.836]  And all this couldn't happen if that wasn't going on.
[01:26:22.337 --> 01:26:23.718]  And on top of it, the U.N.
[01:26:23.738 --> 01:26:24.699]  couldn't come in as the savior.
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:27.883]  This is all about giving America a big fat black eye.
[01:26:28.424 --> 01:26:29.245]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:29.285 --> 01:26:30.726]  More calls, more news straight ahead.
[01:26:33.029 --> 01:26:33.930]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.411 --> 01:26:36.012]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.934 --> 01:26:39.637]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.808 --> 01:26:44.609]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:47.672]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[01:26:47.912 --> 01:26:49.733]  Call Term Busters now.
[01:26:50.074 --> 01:26:51.435]  Rates are low right now.
[01:26:51.575 --> 01:26:52.736]  Call and compare.
[01:26:52.996 --> 01:26:56.499]  For example, for $59 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:26:56.599 --> 01:26:57.780]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:27:16.667 --> 01:27:18.509]  His job to offer battle.
[01:27:19.449 --> 01:27:20.810]  The bad men good and far.
[01:27:21.731 --> 01:27:27.195]  Americans have forgotten the ancestral memory of enslavement, of tyranny.
[01:27:27.295 --> 01:27:29.937]  I mean, just a few decades ago, people didn't trust the government.
[01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:31.619]  You didn't tattle on your neighbors.
[01:27:31.659 --> 01:27:32.800]  That was looked down upon.
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:40.626]  It was looked kindly upon in Soviet China and Soviet Russia and all those types of places in Nazi Germany.
[01:27:41.867 --> 01:27:42.047]  But
[01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:45.092]  It was always looked down upon in some of the freer countries.
[01:27:45.392 --> 01:27:50.413]  Now it's a good, wholesome thing, and there's hundreds of public service announcements on TV and radio every day.
[01:27:50.453 --> 01:27:51.234]  Well, really, thousands.
[01:27:51.694 --> 01:27:53.434]  Hundreds of thousands if you count all the stations together.
[01:27:54.475 --> 01:28:03.177]  But dozens a day on each station telling you how to be a good secret police member, much of the curriculum in public school with BATF for whole semesters is what type of guns do your parents own?
[01:28:03.358 --> 01:28:05.578]  I mean, this is all admitted, and this isn't America.
[01:28:06.298 --> 01:28:11.000]  Again, tracker chips on all the cell phones pinpointing you down to a few feet, tracked by Homeland Security.
[01:28:11.733 --> 01:28:14.815]  The Green Bay News admitting that Homeland Security can dial in and listen to you.
[01:28:14.835 --> 01:28:17.837]  Television Week admitting Homeland Security can listen to you through your television.
[01:28:18.097 --> 01:28:20.018]  That's 1984, folks!
[01:28:20.238 --> 01:28:21.319]  That's not America!
[01:28:22.059 --> 01:28:25.241]  Why isn't Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity talking about that?
[01:28:25.261 --> 01:28:25.822]  Well, they're not.
[01:28:26.162 --> 01:28:31.945]  Sean Hannity says every child needs an implantable microchip and attacks me on the air because I'm against it.
[01:28:33.826 --> 01:28:34.647]  I'm sick of it.
[01:28:34.687 --> 01:28:36.188]  This stuff is crazy.
[01:28:36.248 --> 01:28:38.149]  It's absolutely out of control.
[01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:39.490]  Now,
[01:28:41.252 --> 01:28:43.873]  Got a bunch of different key news articles here, folks.
[01:28:43.973 --> 01:28:45.994]  A whole slew of them.
[01:28:48.295 --> 01:28:55.338]  And they're all important, but I want to get to Charles and Mike and John and David and Karen and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[01:28:55.979 --> 01:28:58.159]  You want to join us on air.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.360]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:05.903]  Before I go any further, folks, I've made some really good videos.
[01:29:07.068 --> 01:29:07.848]  We're good to go.
[01:29:07.889 --> 01:29:08.409]  We're good to go.
[01:29:33.877 --> 01:29:36.658]  You need to get America Destroyed by Design that I made in 1997.
[01:29:37.398 --> 01:29:41.820]  You need to get Police State 2000 that I made in 99.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:43.301]  The Takeover that I made in 2000.
[01:29:44.261 --> 01:29:47.122]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove that I made in 2001.
[01:29:47.943 --> 01:29:51.584]  You need to get comprehensive annual financial reports exposed.
[01:29:52.224 --> 01:29:59.207]  Or interview a former IRS Treasury investigator who quit when he found out it was run basically as an offshore scam for private banks.
[01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:01.168]  That's right, you pay your money into the private government.
[01:30:02.581 --> 01:30:04.882]  And Walter Burien about the biggest game in town.
[01:30:05.342 --> 01:30:06.622]  You need to have these videos.
[01:30:06.682 --> 01:30:08.383]  Now there's 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:30:09.743 --> 01:30:11.824]  There's part two of that, The Masters of Terror.
[01:30:12.444 --> 01:30:14.684]  There's my newest film, Police State's Retotal Enslavement.
[01:30:14.844 --> 01:30:16.245]  There's my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:30:16.405 --> 01:30:18.385]  The book I published that I think is just amazing.
[01:30:18.645 --> 01:30:27.688]  The best book out there on government-sponsored terror and problem reaction solution is Ordered Out of Chaos by Paul Joseph Watson that I published.
[01:30:27.968 --> 01:30:30.248]  It's on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:31.309]  Don't wait.
[01:30:31.349 --> 01:30:32.169]  Go get that book.
[01:30:33.703 --> 01:30:34.723]  1995, 300 plus pages.
[01:30:35.564 --> 01:30:38.826]  Get a second book for only $12 as a gift to your friends or family.
[01:30:39.126 --> 01:30:49.493]  Give the gift of knowledge and support this show so I can pay my employees, so I can make more films, so I can get this stuff done, folks.
[01:30:50.634 --> 01:30:53.036]  We need your support, but that's secondary.
[01:30:53.276 --> 01:30:54.356]  We need you to get the films.
[01:30:54.417 --> 01:30:59.420]  Who else says, get my videos, make copies for non-profit, not for sale purposes?
[01:31:01.061 --> 01:31:01.922]  Who else says that?
[01:31:02.182 --> 01:31:02.482]  Nobody.
[01:31:03.343 --> 01:31:04.344]  Air them on AXS TV.
[01:31:04.364 --> 01:31:05.064]  Get them out to people.
[01:31:05.424 --> 01:31:06.285]  I, the thrill.
[01:31:06.945 --> 01:31:09.106]  What's the equivalent of gold to me?
[01:31:11.007 --> 01:31:13.809]  What's the equivalent of yachts and big cars to Alex Jones?
[01:31:13.849 --> 01:31:15.310]  It's waking people up.
[01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:16.710]  It's unlocking minds.
[01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:20.072]  It's showing people the serial killers that run the world.
[01:31:20.232 --> 01:31:23.954]  It's about survival for me because I clearly see what's happening.
[01:31:24.194 --> 01:31:28.457]  I wanted the whole truth, and I got the whole truth, folks, as Patrick Henry said.
[01:31:28.477 --> 01:31:31.538]  He said, let me have the whole of it, no matter how bad.
[01:31:31.758 --> 01:31:32.519]  I'd rather know it.
[01:31:34.358 --> 01:31:36.580]  That's my payoff, is unlocking minds.
[01:31:38.462 --> 01:31:39.883]  That's what I'm greedy for.
[01:31:39.943 --> 01:31:40.924]  That's what I covet.
[01:31:43.306 --> 01:31:53.236]  That's what I'm jealous of, that I can't do enough, that I'm jealous and envious of the other duties I have because I can't just totally dedicate myself to this fight.
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.161]  So you need to get the videos.
[01:31:57.181 --> 01:31:58.682]  You need to order them right now.
[01:31:58.782 --> 01:31:59.923]  You need to call.
[01:31:59.943 --> 01:32:01.664]  You need to stop procrastinating.
[01:32:01.684 --> 01:32:09.509]  You need to get them and make 10 copies and give them to the police chief, the sheriff, the county commissioners, that local talk show host, and just tell them, hey, this is some powerful info.
[01:32:09.589 --> 01:32:10.810]  Watch it if you love America.
[01:32:12.591 --> 01:32:14.712]  The toll-free number to get the videos, to get the books.
[01:32:14.953 --> 01:32:16.213]  My book's only $12, by the way, 220-something pages.
[01:32:16.233 --> 01:32:16.694]  911 to send to Charity.
[01:32:16.734 --> 01:32:16.954]  To call...
[01:32:22.734 --> 01:32:23.715]  Toll free is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:23.755 --> 01:32:24.195]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:32:24.215 --> 01:32:28.238]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:32:49.315 --> 01:32:56.341]  Again, that's 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:32:56.981 --> 01:32:59.843]  Charles in Pennsylvania, then Mike, John, and others.
[01:32:59.883 --> 01:33:00.664]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:33:01.545 --> 01:33:06.188]  Yeah, Mr. Jones, meant to call you yesterday, didn't get a chance to.
[01:33:06.729 --> 01:33:18.378]  There was a gentleman that called, and I hope he's listening, that called a radio station here in Pittsburgh, and he brought up your name several times in InfoWars.com and that sort of thing.
[01:33:19.298 --> 01:33:25.764]  The guy that he called, I realize that he didn't threaten him, but it could be construed that way.
[01:33:26.444 --> 01:33:33.030]  And that gentleman that he's calling is solidly in with the police at just about every level.
[01:33:34.711 --> 01:33:44.880]  After a certain group of police worked me over, this gentleman did a fundraiser for them, and the woman who works for him as his director said,
[01:33:45.379 --> 01:33:48.761]  Well, there's a lot of that stuff that's done that's staged.
[01:33:48.801 --> 01:33:49.242]  I understand.
[01:33:49.262 --> 01:33:51.903]  I heard O'Reilly one day, they claimed that it was...
[01:34:11.326 --> 01:34:14.849]  Randy Weaver, and obviously he wasn't, but they asked, oh, we have Randy Weaver on the line, let's talk to him.
[01:34:15.269 --> 01:34:23.756]  Well, I'm an idiot, and I'm a racist, and I'm going to do all this horrible stuff, and, oh, I guess I deserve what happened to me, and Bill O'Reilly, well, there goes Randy Weaver.
[01:34:24.921 --> 01:34:26.822]  And so I have no idea about the show you're talking about.
[01:34:27.022 --> 01:34:28.362]  I'm not going to mention his name.
[01:34:28.422 --> 01:34:30.283]  But we have those here in Austin.
[01:34:31.564 --> 01:34:36.565]  We have those type of people here in Austin that are just basically worshippers of any type of corruption.
[01:34:37.106 --> 01:34:38.806]  They're there to back up the crime syndicates.
[01:34:38.846 --> 01:34:39.647]  I mean, look at Houston.
[01:34:39.887 --> 01:34:41.487]  The police admit they frame everybody.
[01:34:41.567 --> 01:34:42.968]  They shake down all the businesses.
[01:34:43.388 --> 01:34:45.749]  They do roundups on the streets of random families.
[01:34:46.909 --> 01:34:50.471]  They had paddy wagons out one night, blocked off the road in a major restaurant district.
[01:34:50.491 --> 01:34:53.892]  Arrested people, grabbed their kids, threw them in paddy wagons, laughed at them.
[01:34:54.691 --> 01:34:57.933]  They're just randomly arresting people here, and that's been in the news.
[01:34:58.174 --> 01:35:00.035]  It's just Soviet America.
[01:35:00.475 --> 01:35:02.637]  And these talk shows get on the air and say, I don't care.
[01:35:02.657 --> 01:35:04.958]  I don't care who they kill or what they do.
[01:35:05.038 --> 01:35:05.439]  It's good.
[01:35:05.459 --> 01:35:10.942]  I don't know about your little talk show host or who you're talking about calling in the show, but the person sounded like an idiot.
[01:35:10.962 --> 01:35:12.003]  It was probably staged.
[01:35:12.804 --> 01:35:18.247]  Well, I understand why this guy, because if you listen to him, he will make you extremely angry.
[01:35:18.407 --> 01:35:20.369]  And I understand what he called it first.
[01:35:20.409 --> 01:35:21.810]  He brought up that Hannity...
[01:35:22.478 --> 01:35:23.079]  I don't even know.
[01:35:23.119 --> 01:35:23.899]  What town is this?
[01:35:23.959 --> 01:35:24.260]  Pittsburgh.
[01:35:39.928 --> 01:35:42.110]  I've been on the radio a lot of different interviews in Pittsburgh.
[01:35:42.731 --> 01:35:43.891]  I really don't worry about that.
[01:35:44.172 --> 01:35:47.374]  If the guy's listening, I just wanted to give him a little tip about the guy.
[01:35:47.735 --> 01:35:49.076]  Don't do that.
[01:35:49.176 --> 01:35:52.238]  I agree, but violence is not the way to go or threats of it.
[01:35:52.278 --> 01:35:56.622]  They're the ones that have to be violent, and there's a lot of cowards that want to cozy up to the evil.
[01:35:56.702 --> 01:35:57.823]  Deep down, they're afraid of it.
[01:35:58.103 --> 01:36:00.725]  They're cowards, and they're going to be crushed by their own system.
[01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:04.068]  We don't have to judge them.
[01:36:04.148 --> 01:36:06.750]  God's going to deal with these people in their own lives.
[01:36:07.810 --> 01:36:09.650]  And I just feel sorry for them.
[01:36:09.710 --> 01:36:15.071]  Like Christ said, Oh, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do, because they're going right into the jaws of hell itself.
[01:36:15.111 --> 01:36:15.731]  Thanks for the call.
[01:36:16.352 --> 01:36:17.072]  Really appreciate it.
[01:36:17.112 --> 01:36:18.992]  Michael in Rhode Island, good to hear from you, sir.
[01:36:20.552 --> 01:36:20.972]  Hey, Alex.
[01:36:21.592 --> 01:36:32.854]  Lately I've been drafting up an article for my local paper about 9-11, how it was government-sponsored, how it was government-backed, how the government knew about it and allowed it to happen in order to get their agenda through.
[01:36:33.275 --> 01:36:35.475]  That is criminal elements that control the government.
[01:36:35.795 --> 01:36:35.975]  Good.
[01:36:36.676 --> 01:36:38.057]  Sure, no problem.
[01:37:05.305 --> 01:37:09.467]  But through all my research, I've been documenting everything, as I've said.
[01:37:09.487 --> 01:37:13.068]  However, there's one bit of information, which I haven't been able to find.
[01:37:13.089 --> 01:37:14.589]  I've looked at firstgov.org.
[01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:17.150]  I've been to numerous federal sites, the White House sites.
[01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:18.751]  Okay, what is it?
[01:37:19.231 --> 01:37:24.093]  That is W1999, the order which Bush signed in order to prevent the al-Qaeda investigation.
[01:37:24.594 --> 01:37:31.337]  I have not been able to find the firsthand documented source for that article, which I need in order to really hit it to them.
[01:37:31.357 --> 01:37:34.118]  That's a smoking gun that's going to hit them like a hurricane.
[01:37:34.591 --> 01:37:37.935]  If I can locate the first-hand source, government article.
[01:37:37.955 --> 01:37:40.958]  Now, what exactly are you saying, government article?
[01:37:41.018 --> 01:37:41.639]  What do you want?
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.582]  You know the order that Bush signed, W1999?
[01:37:44.602 --> 01:37:52.750]  Well, I mean, you certainly know that when there's a BBC report about a secret document that the BBC's gotten, I mean, they don't release the document.
[01:37:52.791 --> 01:37:54.052]  They were threatened with arrest.
[01:37:54.778 --> 01:37:55.659]  We're good to go.
[01:37:55.679 --> 01:37:55.839]  I think?
[01:38:13.691 --> 01:38:14.511]  ...is not public.
[01:38:14.531 --> 01:38:16.632]  People keep calling me over the years, where's W1999?
[01:38:16.812 --> 01:38:23.415]  We've got like nine mainstream news articles posted about news agencies that have seen W1999.
[01:38:23.835 --> 01:38:33.358]  John O'Neill, the late deputy director who got killed on September 11th, just so happened, he's the guy that leaked W1999 to Greg Palast, okay?
[01:38:33.978 --> 01:38:35.699]  A BBC Newsnight reporter.
[01:38:36.246 --> 01:38:37.107]  What exactly was that?
[01:38:37.127 --> 01:38:38.108]  An executive order?
[01:38:38.148 --> 01:38:38.849]  What type of document?
[01:38:38.869 --> 01:38:46.438]  Well, no, there's executive orders, there's presidential decision directives, and in the film I call it a PDD because it is, but the president can sign whatever type of order he wants.
[01:38:46.478 --> 01:38:50.963]  He has interdepartmental memos and orders, and that was a presidential order.
[01:38:52.341 --> 01:39:03.487]  What they call a PDD, but not listed in the normal PDD section, was an interdepartmental memo by the Chief Executive Bush to the Justice Department, ordered to the FBI.
[01:39:03.687 --> 01:39:05.528]  Then we have the ramifications of W1999.
[01:39:07.777 --> 01:39:22.264]  In my second film on September 11th, Masters of Terror, where FBI agent Robert Wright is crying on C-SPAN at the National Press Club, Larry Klayman walks over and says, all I can say is the Bushes' vacation with the Bin Ladens, we have this letter, we'll be arrested.
[01:39:23.285 --> 01:39:28.547]  If we tell you what we know, here's the letter from the Justice Department.
[01:39:29.028 --> 01:39:31.669]  So they were told, I'm sure you heard the FBI agents were told,
[01:39:32.449 --> 01:39:32.909]  Right, yeah.
[01:39:32.929 --> 01:39:34.169]  Stop their investigation.
[01:39:34.209 --> 01:39:36.570]  So we're told there's W1999.
[01:39:36.610 --> 01:39:37.530]  John O'Neill leaked it.
[01:39:38.290 --> 01:39:38.670]  Okay.
[01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:41.751]  Two pages are published.
[01:39:43.311 --> 01:39:53.313]  And then we see FBI agents in Phoenix and in Illinois and Texas and Dallas telling us, yes, we were told we'd be fired, arrested, or worse, if we stopped these guys.
[01:39:53.794 --> 01:39:54.834]  So there it is right there.
[01:39:55.054 --> 01:40:00.375]  Not just the reports, not just two pages of it, but then the FBI all over the place telling you that that happened.
[01:40:01.482 --> 01:40:04.564]  There's no way I can get that from Freedom of Information Act.
[01:40:05.524 --> 01:40:06.304]  Go ahead and try.
[01:40:06.324 --> 01:40:07.205]  Yeah, it's been tried.
[01:40:07.925 --> 01:40:09.466]  Sir, you have to understand.
[01:40:10.066 --> 01:40:16.009]  It's like Deep Throat or something telling the folks at the Washington Post, you know, this is what's happening.
[01:40:16.029 --> 01:40:17.290]  Then you've got to go ferret it out.
[01:40:18.230 --> 01:40:20.552]  But sure, Northwoods is declassified.
[01:40:20.572 --> 01:40:21.392]  You get the whole document.
[01:40:21.412 --> 01:40:22.372]  Well, some of it's blacked out.
[01:40:23.213 --> 01:40:27.575]  I mean, certainly, you might be able to get W199I, but it's going to be all blacked out.
[01:40:27.795 --> 01:40:31.237]  This is just basic document research stuff, but
[01:40:31.966 --> 01:40:33.187]  Look, the story came out.
[01:40:33.747 --> 01:40:34.887]  Several pages were released.
[01:40:35.227 --> 01:40:37.508]  Greg Palast said on this show they couldn't release anymore.
[01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:38.969]  I talked to him proudly on the phone.
[01:40:39.489 --> 01:40:42.771]  They said Lord Rothschild was putting a lot of pressure on them not to release this.
[01:40:43.551 --> 01:40:45.172]  Yes, Lord Wakeham of N.M.
[01:40:45.212 --> 01:40:47.153]  Rothschild was pressuring them not to release it.
[01:40:47.773 --> 01:40:49.494]  That's Greg Palast, Newsnight BBC.
[01:40:50.987 --> 01:40:54.669]  All the time you hear about the newspapers getting threatened not to release a secret document.
[01:40:54.689 --> 01:40:56.631]  Remember Cheney's Energy Commission stuff?
[01:40:56.911 --> 01:40:57.391]  Yes, I do.
[01:40:57.511 --> 01:40:59.472]  Threatening to arrest Judicial Watch and all that?
[01:40:59.712 --> 01:40:59.852]  Yes.
[01:41:00.413 --> 01:41:01.933]  Okay, well it's just more of that, sir.
[01:41:02.194 --> 01:41:04.575]  But W1999 has not been denied.
[01:41:05.175 --> 01:41:13.400]  W1999, the first two pages have been released, and the FBI has confirmed, the independent agents, that yes, they were ordered, threatened with arrest if they stopped Al-Qaeda.
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:17.462]  And the BBC reporters who broke the first two pages were also threatened with arrest if
[01:41:18.664 --> 01:41:23.547]  Well, they were told, that's classified, you can't print that, you've got to get off this story.
[01:41:24.728 --> 01:41:26.129]  Okay, that's what Greg Palast said.
[01:41:26.329 --> 01:41:26.989]  Well, shocking.
[01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:31.052]  I'm definitely going to include that in my article, and this is going to hit the campus like a hurricane, I'm telling you that.
[01:41:31.132 --> 01:41:31.452]  Good.
[01:41:31.592 --> 01:41:33.233]  They're waking up everyone from coast to coast.
[01:41:33.393 --> 01:41:34.354]  You keep it up, my friend.
[01:41:34.374 --> 01:41:35.234]  Thanks for the call, Michael.
[01:41:35.274 --> 01:41:35.874]  Thank you.
[01:41:35.894 --> 01:41:37.996]  Appreciate you.
[01:41:38.096 --> 01:41:44.980]  Yeah, that W199i thing, I mean, I've had so-called neocon talk show hosts who claim they're fighting the New World Order go, where is the W199i, Alex?
[01:41:48.012 --> 01:41:50.475]  Well, it's in my book, 9-1-1 to Sentineltarian.
[01:41:52.096 --> 01:42:00.926]  Bill Clinton signed the order, the original W-1-9-9-I in 96, ordering that bin Laden's family and the Al-Qaeda be left alone.
[01:42:00.946 --> 01:42:01.827]  There's a copy of that.
[01:42:02.828 --> 01:42:07.053]  And then right below it, there is Bush reissuing the order two months before 9-11.
[01:42:07.073 --> 01:42:07.373]  So there it is.
[01:42:11.108 --> 01:42:12.930]  Can they release the names of field agents?
[01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:15.032]  Can they release secret codes and all that?
[01:42:15.392 --> 01:42:16.713]  No, that's classified.
[01:42:16.993 --> 01:42:23.118]  This was a secret document, and the man who released it, from all the evidence, John O'Neill, is dead.
[01:42:23.138 --> 01:42:26.361]  I think that adds a little more validity to it, too.
[01:42:26.781 --> 01:42:27.802]  John in Ohio.
[01:42:27.882 --> 01:42:28.643]  John, you're on the air.
[01:42:28.703 --> 01:42:29.123]  Go ahead.
[01:42:30.124 --> 01:42:30.985]  Yes, Alex.
[01:42:31.225 --> 01:42:35.689]  You know, sometimes when I listen to you, I absolutely cheer, and then other times I cringe.
[01:42:35.889 --> 01:42:39.072]  And I don't belong to any organization, but I do occasionally...
[01:42:39.572 --> 01:42:45.116]  Well, you know, I think in some cases you distort their positions and... I do not distort it.
[01:42:45.136 --> 01:42:46.016]  Socialism is evil and anti-human.
[01:43:01.946 --> 01:43:03.987]  Well, just let me get some of these points.
[01:43:04.007 --> 01:43:09.731]  Well, just don't, please don't call up and tell me how good socialism is, and then expect me not to counter you, not to throw up on you.
[01:43:09.951 --> 01:43:14.514]  Well, okay, now let me talk about what you just mentioned, for instance, the Northwoods Project.
[01:43:14.594 --> 01:43:20.778]  Now, the whole purpose and point of that was to set up and frame up Cuba for attack.
[01:43:20.878 --> 01:43:21.198]  Yes.
[01:43:21.858 --> 01:43:30.784]  Yes, now I never, it seems like whenever you mention that, you mention the fact that it was designed to fabricate terrorist attacks against Americans by the Pentagon,
[01:43:33.004 --> 01:43:39.254]  In my book, in my film, have you seen Road to Tyranny?
[01:43:39.854 --> 01:43:40.375]  No, I haven't.
[01:43:40.716 --> 01:43:42.719]  You ought to, but we detail.
[01:43:42.819 --> 01:43:44.261]  Now, it wasn't just about Cuba.
[01:43:44.281 --> 01:43:45.944]  It was about a war with the Soviet Union.
[01:43:46.832 --> 01:43:47.873]  And let me expand on that.
[01:43:47.893 --> 01:43:49.555]  It was about arresting people domestically.
[01:43:49.875 --> 01:43:51.997]  They described sniper attacks in D.C.
[01:43:52.017 --> 01:43:57.123]  to be carried out by the Pentagon to then be blamed on radicals.
[01:43:57.223 --> 01:43:59.225]  And the radicals today, of course, are black Muslims.
[01:43:59.425 --> 01:44:00.366]  That's who it was blamed on.
[01:44:00.586 --> 01:44:02.468]  We have seen all of North was carried out.
[01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:05.351]  Let me stop you and I'll hold you over if I have to.
[01:44:05.371 --> 01:44:06.312]  In 1967, the USS Liberty.
[01:44:08.479 --> 01:44:11.842]  Attacked for four hours by the Israelis under Pentagon control.
[01:44:12.322 --> 01:44:14.264]  Israel didn't initiate that.
[01:44:14.484 --> 01:44:15.425]  I'm not saying they're good, folks.
[01:44:15.445 --> 01:44:18.007]  My point is, they were under the control of the Pentagon.
[01:44:18.368 --> 01:44:20.069]  The planes were held back by LBJ.
[01:44:20.289 --> 01:44:21.651]  That was to be blamed on Egypt.
[01:44:22.051 --> 01:44:28.436]  Northwood is only one of Zebra Rifle Team and Bojinka and all these government programs.
[01:44:28.817 --> 01:44:29.617]  Well, I agree with that.
[01:44:29.678 --> 01:44:32.120]  But the point I'm trying to make here is that
[01:44:33.161 --> 01:44:40.927]  Do you know who put Fidel Castro into power, buddy?
[01:44:42.008 --> 01:44:47.792]  You know who held back the air support and left the Cubans on the shore without the right ammo?
[01:44:48.913 --> 01:44:50.594]  The globalists control the communists.
[01:44:50.615 --> 01:44:51.775]  They put Mao in power.
[01:44:51.835 --> 01:44:54.097]  That's now admitted.
[01:44:54.297 --> 01:44:55.638]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[01:44:56.679 --> 01:45:01.283]  The bloody, murdering, trash communists make me sick.
[01:45:03.795 --> 01:45:05.596]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[01:45:05.796 --> 01:45:08.656]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[01:45:08.896 --> 01:45:10.717]  Call Term Busters now.
[01:45:11.037 --> 01:45:12.417]  Rates are low right now.
[01:45:12.557 --> 01:45:13.718]  Call and compare.
[01:45:13.978 --> 01:45:21.420]  For example, a man age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1 million of coverage is only $75 a month.
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:24.462]  If you're a smoker, we have great rates for you, too.
[01:45:24.742 --> 01:45:26.143]  Call Term Busters now.
[01:45:26.163 --> 01:45:26.263]  800-430-6692.
[01:45:26.283 --> 01:45:26.404]  800-430-6692.
[01:45:26.424 --> 01:45:29.707]  We specialize in term life insurance policies of a half million dollars or more.
[01:45:48.784 --> 01:45:54.248]  Remember, $1 million in term life insurance coverage for as little as $3 a day.
[01:45:54.349 --> 01:45:55.509]  Call right now.
[01:45:55.810 --> 01:45:57.511]  Operators are standing by.
[01:45:57.531 --> 01:45:57.571]  800-430-6692.
[01:45:57.591 --> 01:45:58.372]  800-430-6692.
[01:46:00.153 --> 01:46:09.440]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:17.787]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:46:18.047 --> 01:46:26.690]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[01:46:26.771 --> 01:46:32.753]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:37.975]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:46:38.235 --> 01:46:47.221]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:46:47.501 --> 01:46:54.586]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:46:54.706 --> 01:46:56.006]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:46:56.046 --> 01:46:56.407]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:47:03.371 --> 01:47:10.176]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:47:10.536 --> 01:47:11.897]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:47:12.098 --> 01:47:14.319]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:47:14.459 --> 01:47:16.541]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:47:16.821 --> 01:47:21.765]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:47:22.105 --> 01:47:26.128]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:47:26.388 --> 01:47:27.209]  We're good to go.
[01:47:27.269 --> 01:47:28.369]  We're good to go.
[01:47:54.187 --> 01:47:55.107]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:55.208 --> 01:47:57.509]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:15.776 --> 01:48:19.898]  Let me just tell Tom that if he likes socialism, he should love Bush.
[01:48:19.978 --> 01:48:25.421]  I mean, bigger government, more regulations, more control, gun confiscation, open borders.
[01:48:25.441 --> 01:48:29.723]  Because that's what I see all the socialists on the campuses pushing for, gun control, open borders.
[01:48:30.679 --> 01:48:33.701]  All that, and yes, they were going to go in and take Fidel out.
[01:48:33.861 --> 01:48:38.824]  That was the pretext for carrying out terrorist attacks under Operation Northwoods.
[01:48:38.844 --> 01:48:43.427]  But Fidel Castro and Mao and all of them, Lenin, were put in by the bankers.
[01:48:43.868 --> 01:48:45.889]  Now, are you not aware of that, John?
[01:48:46.499 --> 01:48:49.560]  Well, you know, I think this is what you're really doing here.
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:49:06.347]  I commend you in exposing 9-11, exposing the threats to civil liberties and the rest, and you don't believe the military, industrial, corporate media when it comes to these things, but you believe and promote the most destructive propaganda when it can be labeled anti-communist propaganda.
[01:49:06.687 --> 01:49:10.551]  You seem to promote the globalist corporate CIA propaganda.
[01:49:10.571 --> 01:49:17.458]  You don't understand that the capitalists created communism as a way to con the serfs back into feudalism.
[01:49:17.619 --> 01:49:20.922]  Well, I know that nutty John Birch Society version of it.
[01:49:20.962 --> 01:49:21.903]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:49:22.003 --> 01:49:23.185]  I'm not going to sit here and argue.
[01:49:23.285 --> 01:49:27.249]  Buddy, we've got a lot of callers who want to talk, and I'm not going to sit here and hear this.
[01:49:28.211 --> 01:49:30.812]  Don't tell me, John, it's not nutty.
[01:49:31.893 --> 01:49:32.873]  It's historical.
[01:49:33.093 --> 01:49:39.477]  Why would 14 different capitalist countries invade the Soviet Union immediately after the Bolshevik Revolution?
[01:49:39.597 --> 01:49:43.599]  I mean, it's really ridiculous, the claim that... It's not the case.
[01:49:43.699 --> 01:49:47.981]  British intelligence wanted to get rid of their cousins, the czars, and they used the communists.
[01:49:48.441 --> 01:49:51.062]  The Communist Manifesto was written right there in England.
[01:49:51.402 --> 01:49:52.843]  The whole thing was financed.
[01:49:53.523 --> 01:49:54.604]  Cecil Rhodes...
[01:49:55.824 --> 01:49:59.385]  Said we will use socialism and communism to control people?
[01:49:59.585 --> 01:50:01.705]  The only reason that... Hey, hey, hey!
[01:50:01.885 --> 01:50:02.506]  The British!
[01:50:02.846 --> 01:50:07.767]  Take our young men, turn them into Rhodes Scholars, send them back, and they push for socialism and communism.
[01:50:08.087 --> 01:50:08.587]  Come on!
[01:50:08.647 --> 01:50:09.247]  Give me a break.
[01:50:09.287 --> 01:50:09.967]  Thanks for the call.
[01:50:10.607 --> 01:50:11.447]  I've got to move on.
[01:50:11.608 --> 01:50:13.048]  You can call me back when I've got more time.
[01:50:13.108 --> 01:50:15.428]  I just cannot sit here and hear you go, Nutty!
[01:50:16.048 --> 01:50:18.289]  John Birch Society's Nutty!
[01:50:19.082 --> 01:50:20.903]  Well, I don't know about the John Birch Society, buddy.
[01:50:21.023 --> 01:50:22.124]  I know I've researched it.
[01:50:22.564 --> 01:50:27.126]  And I know when McCarthy found out that the capitalists controlled the communists, that's when he got in trouble.
[01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:28.827]  And McCarthy was good.
[01:50:29.708 --> 01:50:30.848]  You've got a big problem, buddy.
[01:50:30.868 --> 01:50:31.329]  You really do.
[01:50:31.349 --> 01:50:35.711]  All right, we don't have time to go to Gary and Tom and Michael right now.
[01:50:35.731 --> 01:50:36.551]  We'll get to you in the next hour.
[01:50:36.571 --> 01:50:39.353]  I want to hit on a couple news items here before we end this hour.
[01:50:40.313 --> 01:50:42.495]  Again, the recall is back on for October 7th.
[01:50:42.555 --> 01:50:46.577]  It's now come out that there's a secret file of Arnold...
[01:50:47.883 --> 01:50:55.025]  By one of the more famous perverts out there, you know, the guy that did stuff with the bull whips and the crucifix and all that.
[01:50:55.545 --> 01:50:58.426]  Well, it turns out Arnold's involved with that fella.
[01:50:58.966 --> 01:51:00.727]  One of his favorite little friends.
[01:51:00.787 --> 01:51:01.687]  They hung out quite a bit.
[01:51:03.187 --> 01:51:03.508]  Nice!
[01:51:03.648 --> 01:51:04.548]  Christian conservatism.
[01:51:04.608 --> 01:51:07.889]  Again, let the neocons bellow.
[01:51:07.969 --> 01:51:09.369]  Just bring the troops home.
[01:51:10.049 --> 01:51:11.990]  Seattle Times is a great article.
[01:51:12.010 --> 01:51:15.491]  I want to get to that, but we'll do that a little bit later.
[01:51:17.182 --> 01:51:20.603]  It's carte blanche, total legalization, total amnesty by Bush, again.
[01:51:47.447 --> 01:51:49.568]  And what the little socialists promote, Bush is for.
[01:51:49.788 --> 01:51:54.970]  And I want to go into some of the text of Bush's speech, the U.N., and some of the lies there and what's really going on with that.
[01:51:56.271 --> 01:52:00.893]  Another article here, cameras watching students, especially in Biloxi.
[01:52:01.033 --> 01:52:02.833]  Wait till we get to that.
[01:52:03.654 --> 01:52:08.736]  And just a lot of other key stuff I haven't even scratched the surface on.
[01:52:08.776 --> 01:52:16.799]  Again, I'm going to get into Ampane Chase's erotic maple-thorpe nude photos of Schwarzenegger.
[01:52:17.754 --> 01:52:23.715]  The shocking nudes of Republican Schwarzenegger have been kept under lock and key at the state of Robert Mapplethorpe, New York.
[01:52:23.735 --> 01:52:28.096]  The Drugs Report has learned... Well, we already knew this, folks, when the news was years ago.
[01:52:28.596 --> 01:52:36.038]  Mapplethorpe, whose infamous self-portrait with the bullwhip bleep, bleep, bleep, has many photographs.
[01:52:36.298 --> 01:52:37.438]  Bleep, bleep, bleep.
[01:52:37.978 --> 01:52:38.918]  Bleep, bleep, bleep.
[01:52:39.238 --> 01:52:39.838]  Bleep, bleep.
[01:52:41.359 --> 01:52:47.300]  Oh, he considered Schwarzenegger in part of the bleeping bleep, bleep as one of his favorite subjects, one of his little buddies.
[01:52:48.366 --> 01:52:50.247]  Sorry, we can't tell you the details.
[01:52:50.308 --> 01:52:51.108]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:54.030 --> 01:52:57.313]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:52:57.433 --> 01:53:01.676]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:53:01.936 --> 01:53:11.603]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.145 --> 01:53:19.805]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.465 --> 01:53:21.506]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.226 --> 01:53:23.346]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:23.986 --> 01:53:24.806]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.567 --> 01:53:27.487]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.507 --> 01:53:30.808]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.308 --> 01:53:35.389]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:46.544 --> 01:53:47.245]  All right, folks.
[01:53:47.285 --> 01:53:52.367]  We're already 35 seconds into this third and final rip-roaring hour.
[01:53:55.049 --> 01:54:01.012]  And we're about to go straight back to your calls and then into some more of the news that I was just mentioning before we ended the last hour.
[01:54:01.032 --> 01:54:15.380]  I do want to spend some time on this Arnold Schwarzenegger situation because it's come out that he posed for homosexual magazines, but not that he was in the whole Mapplethorpe underworld
[01:54:17.273 --> 01:54:27.416]  Maple Fort, you know, who would photograph the homosexual orgies and blasphemous stuff, defecating on religious Christian icons, putting crosses in urine.
[01:54:27.476 --> 01:54:33.697]  I'm sorry to have to mention this, but this is your Christian conservative that Limbaugh and Hannity love and defend, that Bush says is a good guy.
[01:54:33.957 --> 01:54:34.858]  And they've known all this.
[01:54:34.958 --> 01:54:36.778]  I saw this in newspapers in the 80s, folks.
[01:54:38.598 --> 01:54:40.739]  So it's amazing stuff.
[01:54:41.926 --> 01:54:44.727]  And I think it'll probably get him an even bigger endorsement by Bush.
[01:54:44.827 --> 01:54:46.827]  I mean, this is what they do at the Bohemian Grove, folks.
[01:54:47.407 --> 01:54:49.088]  Or in the Washington Times, Sacramento Bay.
[01:54:49.148 --> 01:54:51.728]  I mean, it's old men running around naked in the woods.
[01:54:52.888 --> 01:54:54.709]  And this is confirmed.
[01:54:55.869 --> 01:54:57.429]  And Arnold loves it there.
[01:54:57.509 --> 01:54:59.090]  He's been hanging out there since the mid-'80s.
[01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:01.210]  It's really sick.
[01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:04.471]  But, I mean, I guess you've got to own racehorses and gamble and...
[01:55:06.718 --> 01:55:08.699]  Have whores all over the place?
[01:55:09.239 --> 01:55:16.380]  Just to write a book on virtues, you've got to... Or to be Pat Robertson, you've got to be involved in that stuff.
[01:55:17.001 --> 01:55:21.722]  But to really be a conservative, you've got to be in homosexual pornos, basically.
[01:55:23.022 --> 01:55:26.083]  So, again, I'm a liberal socialist because I'm against all that.
[01:55:26.123 --> 01:55:27.583]  You know, I'm beginning to figure this out.
[01:55:28.043 --> 01:55:30.104]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Ohio.
[01:55:30.144 --> 01:55:30.984]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:55:31.044 --> 01:55:31.384]  Welcome.
[01:55:31.444 --> 01:55:32.204]  Let's turn that radio off.
[01:55:32.224 --> 01:55:32.964]  That would be...
[01:55:36.386 --> 01:55:37.546]  Absolutely fantastic.
[01:55:38.107 --> 01:55:39.927]  Now let's go back to Tom now.
[01:55:39.987 --> 01:55:42.008]  He maybe is aware that we're talking to him.
[01:55:42.648 --> 01:55:42.908]  Tom?
[01:55:42.948 --> 01:55:43.408]  Here I am.
[01:55:44.049 --> 01:55:44.809]  Here I am, Alex.
[01:55:45.769 --> 01:55:46.469]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:55:47.110 --> 01:55:54.552]  I was calling you to see if I could get... Have you got that newspaper article on the dollar collapse on your website?
[01:55:55.172 --> 01:55:59.294]  Yeah, that'll be posted on mondaysinfowars.com and...
[01:56:00.675 --> 01:56:05.578]  No, no, FridaysInfoWars.com and FridaysPrisonPlanet.com, but I ended up getting around to it.
[01:56:05.658 --> 01:56:05.998]  Oh, yes.
[01:56:06.298 --> 01:56:06.738]  What time?
[01:56:07.959 --> 01:56:10.080]  Well, it's just every day there's an update.
[01:56:10.561 --> 01:56:12.522]  I mean, Friday, do you know what time you'll have it up?
[01:56:13.182 --> 01:56:15.043]  No, no, no, it was up last Friday.
[01:56:15.363 --> 01:56:16.084]  Oh, it's already there.
[01:56:16.264 --> 01:56:17.264]  Yeah, there's an archive.
[01:56:17.284 --> 01:56:18.865]  You just click on whatever Friday was.
[01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:19.266]  Was that the 19th?
[01:56:20.327 --> 01:56:22.027]  Can you give me the news source you got it from, Alex?
[01:56:22.047 --> 01:56:23.328]  Yeah, it was the London Guardian.
[01:56:23.348 --> 01:56:24.088]  It was an official.
[01:56:24.128 --> 01:56:31.350]  It had a link to an IMF statement that the dollar's going to collapse and they're going to take us over and take our standard of living away because they love us and care for us.
[01:56:31.730 --> 01:56:33.871]  Is that LondonGuardian.com?
[01:56:35.371 --> 01:56:38.432]  It's like .co.uk or something.
[01:56:39.355 --> 01:56:41.416]  Sorry, it's just on Infowars.com.
[01:56:41.576 --> 01:56:43.797]  I just wanted to make some copies, Alex, and get them out.
[01:56:43.837 --> 01:56:44.757]  No, no, that's important.
[01:56:44.797 --> 01:56:45.897]  I'm glad you're asking about it.
[01:56:46.578 --> 01:56:49.199]  I really appreciate what you're doing, Alex, and please don't stop.
[01:56:49.279 --> 01:56:49.619]  Thank you.
[01:56:49.979 --> 01:56:51.600]  Well, thank you, Tom, for all you're doing.
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:53.060]  Really appreciate it.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.521]  Gary in Kansas, go ahead.
[01:56:54.541 --> 01:56:58.062]  I just have two quick things.
[01:56:58.082 --> 01:57:02.043]  First, I hope Mel Gibson and if his father's listening, that he'll stay the course.
[01:57:03.344 --> 01:57:05.405]  No, take any scenes out of this movie.
[01:57:05.445 --> 01:57:05.765]  I just...
[01:57:06.736 --> 01:57:08.977]  Out of the Patriot, which was attacked for its evil.
[01:57:09.278 --> 01:57:12.099]  Yep, and they tried to snuff that two out.
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:14.921]  Well, I mean, he's not like Arnold.
[01:57:15.061 --> 01:57:19.644]  Arnold says, I love Hitler, so the Simon Wiesenthal Center gives him their highest award.
[01:57:20.044 --> 01:57:24.887]  Yeah, and yesterday... But see, I don't like Hitler, so I'm attacked by them.
[01:57:26.067 --> 01:57:29.429]  But anyway, yesterday I talked to a lady whose husband's still in Iraq.
[01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:34.192]  I guess a week ago, one of their people in his division or something...
[01:57:39.219 --> 01:57:50.165]  Well, the mission is commit genocide against the Semitic peoples of the Middle East.
[01:57:50.225 --> 01:57:54.267]  The New World Order hates them, whether they're Jews or Palestinians or Arabs.
[01:57:55.128 --> 01:57:58.049]  That's what the globalists want to do, and it's anti-Semitism.
[01:57:58.089 --> 01:58:01.031]  They're killing the Semitic people that live in Iraq.
[01:58:02.347 --> 01:58:08.661]  And they've killed over a million of them, and 500,000 children, 700,000 children, and that went all right, so this is a good price to pay.
[01:58:08.921 --> 01:58:09.262]  Stay there.
[01:58:09.282 --> 01:58:11.347]  I want to hear more news from the front when we get back.
[01:58:14.944 --> 01:58:18.526]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:58:18.786 --> 01:58:20.187]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:58:20.687 --> 01:58:22.108]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:58:22.388 --> 01:58:27.551]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:58:27.931 --> 01:58:32.393]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:58:32.713 --> 01:58:38.116]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation.
[01:58:38.456 --> 01:58:41.398]  Mer used since biblical times for gum disease and clove oil.
[01:58:41.858 --> 01:58:42.999]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:47.222]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:58:47.502 --> 01:58:54.127]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:58:54.467 --> 01:58:58.510]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[01:58:58.951 --> 01:59:00.892]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.

[01:59:14.062 --> 01:59:18.405]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:18.606 --> 01:59:23.029]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:23.169 --> 01:59:27.553]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:59:27.593 --> 01:59:28.934]  The New World Order.
[01:59:30.715 --> 01:59:34.936]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:34.996 --> 01:59:41.919]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:42.059 --> 01:59:44.100]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:54.884]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:55.064 --> 01:59:57.585]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my
[01:59:57.685 --> 01:59:57.925]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:59:57.945 --> 01:59:59.006]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:16.863]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:00:17.123 --> 02:00:20.646]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:00:20.726 --> 02:00:24.669]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:00:24.889 --> 02:00:31.054]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:00:31.474 --> 02:00:39.380]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:45.124]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:00:45.284 --> 02:00:49.046]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:00:49.406 --> 02:00:51.288]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:00:51.348 --> 02:00:53.489]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:00:53.749 --> 02:00:58.672]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:00:58.732 --> 02:01:04.276]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:01:07.658 --> 02:01:11.501]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:01:19.287 --> 02:01:19.927]  Big Brother.
[02:01:20.588 --> 02:01:21.669]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:22.369 --> 02:01:23.510]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:23.530 --> 02:01:24.971]  You want answers?
[02:01:25.691 --> 02:01:26.652]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:27.273 --> 02:01:31.156]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:31.456 --> 02:01:35.539]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:38.198 --> 02:01:50.683]  Alright my friends, already 8 minutes and 27, 8, 9, 30 seconds into the third and final hour of this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[02:01:51.883 --> 02:01:54.124]  I've talked to a lot of troops that have come back from the war.
[02:01:54.304 --> 02:01:55.685]  I'm trying to get them to come on the show.
[02:01:56.325 --> 02:01:58.186]  They think this country is so free they're afraid to do it.
[02:01:59.746 --> 02:02:02.027]  I've talked to a lot of their wives.
[02:02:02.387 --> 02:02:03.608]  I've talked to some of their husbands.
[02:02:04.787 --> 02:02:08.708]  And they say they're doing nothing to help the Iraqis when children are sick or shot.
[02:02:08.748 --> 02:02:09.468]  They don't help them.
[02:02:10.368 --> 02:02:14.789]  They say people are rewarded who are bloodthirsty and killing innocent people.
[02:02:15.529 --> 02:02:20.790]  To have a job, you've got to get a special Halliburton bracelet with an RFID tracker chip.
[02:02:20.850 --> 02:02:22.651]  I mean, it is a model country.
[02:02:23.111 --> 02:02:24.091]  Totally enslaved.
[02:02:24.131 --> 02:02:25.551]  The people totally enslaved.
[02:02:26.332 --> 02:02:28.292]  Criminality, murder all over the streets.
[02:02:29.222 --> 02:02:30.283]  And that's the design.
[02:02:30.343 --> 02:02:31.925]  America plays the part of the bad guy.
[02:02:31.965 --> 02:02:32.966]  Got to really squeeze him.
[02:02:33.206 --> 02:02:33.807]  Then the U.N.
[02:02:33.867 --> 02:02:38.011]  comes in, restores order, brings in the water, does all this, plays the part of the good cop.
[02:02:39.373 --> 02:02:40.955]  And that's exactly what we said would happen.
[02:02:40.975 --> 02:02:42.556]  That's what we're now getting from the troops.
[02:02:42.877 --> 02:02:46.581]  And if there's troops out there listening who just got back and you want to call us, don't be afraid.
[02:02:46.601 --> 02:02:47.602]  They don't know who your voice is.
[02:02:47.622 --> 02:02:48.503]  They don't know who you are.
[02:02:49.263 --> 02:02:50.024]  Give us a call.
[02:02:50.064 --> 02:02:50.785]  Tell us about it.
[02:02:51.288 --> 02:02:51.728]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:51.748 --> 02:02:59.132]  But if you're in the military, call us now, because there won't be lines open in a second.
[02:02:59.152 --> 02:03:00.693]  There are some lines open right now, I'm told.
[02:03:00.713 --> 02:03:02.054]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:03:02.094 --> 02:03:06.316]  And never call.
[02:03:06.356 --> 02:03:08.117]  That number, 800-259-9231.
[02:03:09.838 --> 02:03:11.459]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gary in Kansas.
[02:03:11.479 --> 02:03:16.081]  You say you've been talking to some of the troops that are back, and what are they telling you?
[02:03:16.721 --> 02:03:19.803]  It's the wife I know of one of the troops over there.
[02:03:20.353 --> 02:03:28.876]  We've been knowing each other for about two years, and she hasn't seen him since March, so he's been gone almost seven months, and there's no leave for him.
[02:03:29.096 --> 02:03:30.236]  They're stuck there until April.
[02:03:30.617 --> 02:03:31.417]  He's a reservist.
[02:03:31.517 --> 02:03:46.322]  I'm not going to say much more like you say, but when she told me that guy was so depressed, morale so down over there, and then they don't paint that picture on the news at night, then he literally shot himself to get home to his wife, and he may be court-martialed or whatever they do, but
[02:03:46.792 --> 02:03:49.614]  These guys are being, you know, disused over there.
[02:03:50.014 --> 02:03:52.736]  I feel for the troops because I know the one person.
[02:03:53.376 --> 02:03:57.039]  Also, they truck the water in of questionable quality from Kuwait.
[02:03:57.399 --> 02:03:59.080]  Trucking water in from Kuwait?
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:00.661]  We've done the math.
[02:04:00.801 --> 02:04:08.586]  Just buying them big murkies, which thousands have been sent over there by listeners of this show and by Jim Shepard, goodness of his heart.
[02:04:09.006 --> 02:04:12.047]  They email a lot, she says, and they talk maybe once or twice a week.
[02:04:12.147 --> 02:04:13.708]  But, I mean, think about this.
[02:04:13.928 --> 02:04:15.869]  They don't even give them good water, sir.
[02:04:15.889 --> 02:04:17.229]  No, and then they don't.
[02:04:17.569 --> 02:04:18.630]  She told me that you're right.
[02:04:18.690 --> 02:04:21.591]  They haven't done anything with electrical power, the water stuff.
[02:04:21.611 --> 02:04:23.732]  But that's the genius of the government.
[02:04:23.872 --> 02:04:27.053]  So Halliburton will make more money because they're involved in water supplying.
[02:04:27.293 --> 02:04:29.374]  They won't just sell them some water filters.
[02:04:29.854 --> 02:04:32.755]  The government just won't buy some filters, any of the quality filters that are out there.
[02:04:33.235 --> 02:04:35.135]  And give something to the troops that will give them good water.
[02:04:35.356 --> 02:04:38.976]  It's got to be trucked in, because Halliburton makes so much more money off that, and guess what?
[02:04:38.996 --> 02:04:39.976]  Halliburton's over water.
[02:04:39.997 --> 02:04:44.938]  So, you know, Halliburton's going to restrict the supply so they can make more money off of it.
[02:04:44.958 --> 02:04:45.978]  They don't want to fix anything.
[02:04:46.238 --> 02:04:59.341]  For six months, you'd think we'd be a better, you know, whatever, get things done, but no, we had a gouger of more, $87 billion and all this other stuff, the lies and these things that keep going on with our government, and it's just unreal.
[02:04:59.381 --> 02:05:00.841]  But I just feel for the troops, because
[02:05:01.678 --> 02:05:17.509]  I served in the Reagan years just for a brief moment, but everybody, I hope more will come home safe, but to not be with your wife for a year, not even have like World War II where you had to leave, go for a week or two, then come back or stuff, if you served a certain time.
[02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:25.154]  Well, they told them it's all volunteer, but that's not true because they're recalling people that were in in the early 90s.
[02:05:26.408 --> 02:05:26.788]  We're good to go.
[02:05:26.808 --> 02:05:26.989]  I think?
[02:05:47.552 --> 02:05:49.153]  We've got all that going on.
[02:05:49.973 --> 02:05:54.675]  And now they told the troops, oh, as soon as you get into Baghdad, you'll be back in a month.
[02:05:55.075 --> 02:05:56.035]  That was a lie.
[02:05:56.135 --> 02:06:01.117]  And now they're taking the health care away and charging troops that step on landmines that are shot.
[02:06:01.518 --> 02:06:08.200]  When they're in the hospitals in Germany, this is Stars and Stripes magazine, they are charged $8.
[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:08.760]  What is it?
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:09.241]  $8.10 per meal.
[02:06:09.261 --> 02:06:12.662]  Then you have Afghanistan.
[02:06:12.762 --> 02:06:15.303]  I knew a guy that was over there a year ago.
[02:06:15.871 --> 02:06:20.513]  Yeah, you've got people still policing those, but they're not giving the government back to those people.
[02:06:20.954 --> 02:06:22.534]  Just like you said, the police state again.
[02:06:22.574 --> 02:06:23.615]  But thanks for your time again.
[02:06:24.896 --> 02:06:25.876]  Thanks a lot for the call.
[02:06:25.916 --> 02:06:27.497]  Well, they put all the drug lords in charge.
[02:06:27.597 --> 02:06:29.478]  I mean, now the opium's flowing.
[02:06:29.518 --> 02:06:30.058]  Thank you.
[02:06:30.578 --> 02:06:37.522]  I talked to, at the Alamo Draft House in Houston, the big movie theater where we showed Road to Tyranny to an overflow crowd.
[02:06:38.832 --> 02:06:42.514]  I talked to one guy who'd just gotten back and had a high and tight haircut, all sunburned.
[02:06:42.554 --> 02:06:43.834]  He said, man, it is horrible.
[02:06:43.874 --> 02:06:47.636]  He goes, I was in Kuwait, then in logistics, and then bringing stuff up into the north.
[02:06:47.676 --> 02:06:50.817]  And he said, it is just hell on earth.
[02:06:50.857 --> 02:06:53.398]  Those people are starving to death, cholera sickness.
[02:06:53.738 --> 02:06:54.718]  We kept getting sick.
[02:06:54.999 --> 02:07:01.081]  Because when you've got a starving population, the germs get really bad and spread really bad, and even healthy troops get it.
[02:07:02.642 --> 02:07:06.203]  The troops, it's so hot, and they're sweating so long, and they can't take showers.
[02:07:06.223 --> 02:07:08.124]  They're getting big boils under their arms.
[02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:10.440]  Food's horrible.
[02:07:10.841 --> 02:07:13.942]  The water truck dens all rancid in these big Halliburton trucks.
[02:07:13.962 --> 02:07:15.202]  They won't give them water filters.
[02:07:16.023 --> 02:07:18.764]  There's depleted uranium all over the populated areas.
[02:07:18.804 --> 02:07:20.124]  Troops are all getting real sick.
[02:07:20.484 --> 02:07:24.466]  They're getting sick from the smallpox and anthrax shots, which they now admit is causing a lot of problems.
[02:07:26.026 --> 02:07:29.868]  And when the troops get shot, they have to pay for their own food in the hospital, folks.
[02:07:31.248 --> 02:07:33.950]  And they're being told, you may just stay for year after year after year.
[02:07:33.970 --> 02:07:35.150]  You may never be able to leave.
[02:07:39.262 --> 02:07:40.142]  Unbelievable.
[02:07:40.483 --> 02:07:43.324]  But, oh, supporting the trips means you don't care about them.
[02:07:43.344 --> 02:07:45.724]  You just stick a plastic flag on your car.
[02:07:45.765 --> 02:07:48.165]  It's everything America stands for.
[02:07:48.205 --> 02:07:49.726]  It's flushed down the commode.
[02:07:51.447 --> 02:07:53.487]  I don't want to hear it from you, Alex.
[02:07:53.547 --> 02:07:56.188]  You just aren't patriotic.
[02:07:58.449 --> 02:08:02.031]  We got to compromise and let Bush ban assault weapons.
[02:08:02.051 --> 02:08:02.891]  I've actually heard that.
[02:08:02.951 --> 02:08:05.712]  Well, I just like Bush.
[02:08:06.954 --> 02:08:08.795]  I like my guns a lot more, okay?
[02:08:09.155 --> 02:08:11.917]  Being some idiot, weak-minded person.
[02:08:11.977 --> 02:08:13.497]  Michael in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[02:08:13.517 --> 02:08:14.798]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:08:15.238 --> 02:08:15.558]  How you doing?
[02:08:15.618 --> 02:08:17.159]  I'd like to talk about two subjects.
[02:08:17.619 --> 02:08:21.101]  One, I want to thank you for making your excellent, excellent videos.
[02:08:21.521 --> 02:08:27.224]  Me and my friends John and Mary made hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of copies in the Pittsburgh area and distributed them.
[02:08:27.464 --> 02:08:28.465]  Well, I want to thank you.
[02:08:28.485 --> 02:08:29.946]  No, no, I want to thank you.
[02:08:30.126 --> 02:08:33.207]  You made the resources available to us at such a fractional cost.
[02:08:33.247 --> 02:08:35.789]  Let us use them to help educate your fellow Americans.
[02:08:35.849 --> 02:08:36.629]  I appreciate that.
[02:08:37.971 --> 02:08:42.934]  Point number two is, I want to talk about the guy, Pittsburgh, we were talking about the radio talk show host.
[02:08:43.915 --> 02:08:48.317]  Now, as far as Democrats go, this sounds just like you.
[02:08:48.337 --> 02:08:50.178]  On Clinton, you sound like your brothers.
[02:08:50.839 --> 02:08:54.561]  Waco, 800, wait, 800 don't shut down.
[02:08:54.661 --> 02:08:56.662]  Oklahoma City, you guys sound the same, same.
[02:08:56.722 --> 02:08:59.364]  But when it gets to Bush, he gets like, I don't want to hear it.
[02:09:00.905 --> 02:09:01.225]  At all.
[02:09:01.778 --> 02:09:02.618]  Well, yeah, that's it.
[02:09:02.678 --> 02:09:18.606]  I mean, Bill Clinton's evil, Hillary's evil, oh, they're so bad, let's talk about them all day, but you call in that show and go, why is George Bush blocking pardon gate, actively blocking and protecting Bill Clinton, threatening a World Net Daily reporter that the president says, don't talk about it, and I suggest you do.
[02:09:18.626 --> 02:09:20.327]  You know, that's on the record.
[02:09:20.487 --> 02:09:20.887]  Why?
[02:09:21.127 --> 02:09:24.049]  I don't want to hear about Bill Clinton if George Bush is protecting him.
[02:09:24.089 --> 02:09:24.949]  It makes me mad!
[02:09:25.429 --> 02:09:30.852]  Well, this is where you and he would be an excellent guy to bring on the radio, because these are radio talk shows like you, and
[02:09:31.277 --> 02:09:32.277]  No, no, what does he say about me?
[02:09:32.297 --> 02:09:32.738]  That's fine.
[02:09:51.977 --> 02:09:53.018]  No, that's okay, too.
[02:09:53.158 --> 02:09:54.019]  That's okay, you know?
[02:09:54.059 --> 02:09:55.641]  We have to import criticism.
[02:09:55.721 --> 02:09:56.402]  I love it.
[02:09:56.442 --> 02:09:57.443]  People won't call and do it.
[02:09:58.364 --> 02:09:59.225]  Tell me what he says about it.
[02:09:59.245 --> 02:10:00.547]  I don't even know who this guy is, but tell me.
[02:10:00.667 --> 02:10:01.988]  Well, I'll tell you his name if you want to know his name.
[02:10:02.008 --> 02:10:02.829]  Well, I'll do that offer.
[02:10:02.849 --> 02:10:04.852]  I don't want to give him any attention, but... Hey, that's fine.
[02:10:05.052 --> 02:10:06.253]  But, I mean, tell me what he says about me.
[02:10:06.393 --> 02:10:10.278]  Well, he always says about... He's the crazy guy who makes those goofy videos, and he thinks he...
[02:10:10.798 --> 02:10:18.686]  Yeah, like I told people five years ago that the Supreme Court had said they were going to go under U.N.
[02:10:18.726 --> 02:10:19.086]  control.
[02:10:19.326 --> 02:10:20.707]  That was their own official document.
[02:10:20.888 --> 02:10:22.249]  Now it's been in USA Today.
[02:10:23.147 --> 02:10:23.928]  I mean, this is sick!
[02:10:44.845 --> 02:10:50.609]  I look at the fruit on a tree, folks, and if it's rotten with maggots hanging out of it, I'll say it's got maggots.
[02:10:50.929 --> 02:10:53.210]  George Bush is a gigantic maggot.
[02:10:54.371 --> 02:10:54.711]  Wow.
[02:10:55.111 --> 02:10:56.092]  Hey, you know what?
[02:10:56.432 --> 02:11:00.795]  They'll say about, well, George Bush's dad said about New Order, but he's not his dad's older brother.
[02:11:00.815 --> 02:11:04.177]  He put his little catchy sayings that don't mean anything if it's not real good.
[02:11:04.705 --> 02:11:05.586]  Yeah, sure.
[02:11:05.946 --> 02:11:10.309]  He'll talk about how... No, no, Bush just says global order, our new global order.
[02:11:10.329 --> 02:11:12.090]  He doesn't say new world order.
[02:11:12.290 --> 02:11:13.771]  But all of his minions do.
[02:11:14.132 --> 02:11:14.912]  New world order this.
[02:11:14.932 --> 02:11:17.394]  You ought to go to the PNAC documents written by Cheney and Rumsfeld.
[02:11:17.434 --> 02:11:18.455]  It's new world order.
[02:11:18.475 --> 02:11:19.395]  We're going to take over.
[02:11:19.635 --> 02:11:24.439]  What does he think about Ron Paul, the most conservative voting record, saying the Trotskyites run the White House?
[02:11:24.839 --> 02:11:25.940]  He wouldn't talk about that one.
[02:11:26.100 --> 02:11:27.101]  Oh, I bet he wouldn't.
[02:11:27.701 --> 02:11:28.181]  You'll see.
[02:11:28.442 --> 02:11:28.702]  You'll see.
[02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:31.001]  He doesn't sign on the U.N.
[02:11:31.021 --> 02:11:32.342]  He doesn't sign on the Kyoto Treaty.
[02:11:32.382 --> 02:11:33.882]  He doesn't sign on the W.U.N.
[02:11:33.922 --> 02:11:34.523]  document.
[02:11:34.543 --> 02:11:35.403]  Let me break that down.
[02:11:36.524 --> 02:11:41.426]  He cuts abortion funding by $87 million and then increases it by $3 billion.
[02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:42.567]  Smoke and mirrors.
[02:11:42.607 --> 02:11:44.328]  That's an over $2 billion increase.
[02:11:45.709 --> 02:11:58.635]  He says he doesn't sign on to Kyoto, but then he orders the Chicago mercantile to start selling energy credits and allows it to, quote, be a privatized system, which is what they wanted in the beginning, private taxation.
[02:11:59.135 --> 02:12:01.676]  He goes down to Mexico and says, we need world taxation.
[02:12:02.616 --> 02:12:04.217]  So it's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:12:04.898 --> 02:12:05.358]  Exactly.
[02:12:05.738 --> 02:12:08.539]  Like you've always said, I don't care what people say in these politics.
[02:12:08.719 --> 02:12:09.800]  I watch what they do.
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:11.280]  He signed on to UNESCO.
[02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:11.921]  That's right.
[02:12:11.941 --> 02:12:12.701]  That was the big one.
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:15.222]  He put our troops under U.N.
[02:12:15.262 --> 02:12:15.663]  command.
[02:12:15.723 --> 02:12:16.544]  Then he goes to U.N.
[02:12:16.584 --> 02:12:17.766]  up there and begs their permission.
[02:12:17.806 --> 02:12:21.571]  Hey, if I go to your house and ask you to do something, who's in charge?
[02:12:22.092 --> 02:12:22.453]  That's it.
[02:12:22.473 --> 02:12:24.015]  It's all good cop, bad cop.
[02:12:24.913 --> 02:12:26.714]  Look, they'd have found the weapons of mass destruction.
[02:12:26.754 --> 02:12:28.455]  They would have been caught in all these lies.
[02:12:28.675 --> 02:12:32.177]  They've been ordered to look bad, to look stupid, to make conservatives look bad.
[02:12:32.357 --> 02:12:39.061]  And we should divorce ourselves from Bush, and all these people, or what we call the liberals, are going to take over.
[02:12:39.381 --> 02:12:41.122]  And let me tell you, they're going to love the Patriot Act.
[02:12:41.342 --> 02:12:42.363]  They're going to love the Victory Act.
[02:12:42.383 --> 02:12:43.303]  They're going to love it all.
[02:12:43.523 --> 02:12:46.025]  And the training under Bush isn't about Muslims, folks.
[02:12:46.345 --> 02:12:47.325]  It's about Christians.
[02:12:47.566 --> 02:12:48.526]  It's about conservatives.
[02:12:48.786 --> 02:12:49.987]  That's who's targeted by this.
[02:12:51.568 --> 02:12:56.791]  FEMA is training them right now that homeschoolers and gun owners and land rights groups are illegal.
[02:12:57.731 --> 02:12:58.351]  Thanks for the call.
[02:12:59.032 --> 02:12:59.712]  Really good points.
[02:13:01.793 --> 02:13:11.498]  You know, a lot of these neocons, I don't know about this guy, I don't know who you're talking about, but these neocons at these clear channel stations, they're told, do not talk about Bush.
[02:13:11.578 --> 02:13:12.158]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:15.086 --> 02:13:25.814]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:13:25.994 --> 02:13:33.580]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:36.962]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:13:37.122 --> 02:13:37.563]  We're good to go.
[02:13:55.785 --> 02:14:01.731]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.

[02:15:14.241 --> 02:15:18.142]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:15:18.362 --> 02:15:30.645]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:15:31.065 --> 02:15:31.465]  The U.S.
[02:15:31.505 --> 02:15:37.087]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:15:37.487 --> 02:15:39.688]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:15:41.568 --> 02:15:42.629]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:15:42.669 --> 02:15:45.511]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:15:45.612 --> 02:15:51.636]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[02:16:13.684 --> 02:16:14.464]  Oh, my God!
[02:16:14.725 --> 02:16:19.447]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:16:19.747 --> 02:16:20.408]  Yes, it's true.
[02:16:20.488 --> 02:16:23.189]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:16:23.329 --> 02:16:27.351]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[02:16:27.451 --> 02:16:28.031]  You heard it right.

[02:16:33.334 --> 02:16:34.415]  The list goes on and on.
[02:16:34.635 --> 02:16:38.737]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[02:16:38.837 --> 02:16:40.958]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[02:16:41.138 --> 02:16:41.558]  We're good to go.
[02:17:03.097 --> 02:17:04.998]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[02:17:05.038 --> 02:17:07.198]  I'm going to take five more calls from Chris and Rob and Richard and
[02:17:32.279 --> 02:17:32.920]  Is it Andy?
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:34.281]  Roy?
[02:17:34.361 --> 02:17:35.822]  And others?
[02:17:36.822 --> 02:17:39.544]  And then that's it for the calls, because there's some other news I need to get to.
[02:17:39.604 --> 02:17:42.847]  But the callers are taking us in interesting directions, as usual.
[02:17:43.687 --> 02:17:45.188]  Very interesting and revealing.
[02:17:45.389 --> 02:17:47.230]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Oklahoma.
[02:17:47.290 --> 02:17:48.051]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:17:48.111 --> 02:17:48.511]  Go ahead.
[02:17:49.171 --> 02:17:50.512]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:17:50.873 --> 02:17:51.213]  Welcome.
[02:17:51.773 --> 02:17:59.439]  A friend of mine was telling me that there were some lawsuits to close down websites because they were not accessible to the blinds.
[02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:02.121]  Oh, no, they're not lawsuits.
[02:18:02.261 --> 02:18:14.428]  It's law in England that if one thing on your website isn't accessible, some flash animation, some picture, doesn't have text attached to it, you get long prison sentences.
[02:18:14.768 --> 02:18:20.671]  And then, of course, that's all selectively enforced against politically incorrect websites or smaller groups that don't have the money to do it.
[02:18:21.648 --> 02:18:25.449]  And in this country, they're moving to make even the newspapers do it.
[02:18:25.469 --> 02:18:26.729]  We have a lot of blind listeners.
[02:18:27.149 --> 02:18:28.670]  They've called in and said this is wrong.
[02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:33.891]  And there's all these weird regulations that keep these systems from getting inexpensive for people.
[02:18:34.311 --> 02:18:38.192]  It's just a big scam, but it's all in the name of helping people.
[02:18:38.572 --> 02:18:42.273]  Now, you know, you have to put something out this way so the blind can see it.
[02:18:43.613 --> 02:18:46.974]  Yeah, see, I am actually a blind student.
[02:18:47.074 --> 02:18:48.494]  I'm a computer science student.
[02:18:49.315 --> 02:18:51.019]  Oh, a caller said you were going to call earlier.
[02:18:51.059 --> 02:18:51.420]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:52.602]  Yeah, that would be me.
[02:18:52.622 --> 02:18:57.373]  Yeah, this is wrong, but I want my opinion on it.
[02:18:57.433 --> 02:18:58.736]  If it's a private group...
[02:18:59.514 --> 02:19:03.075]  If that's their property, they should be able to do whatever they wish with it.
[02:19:03.295 --> 02:19:04.316]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[02:19:04.356 --> 02:19:06.497]  But see, this is how we get rid of freedom.
[02:19:06.557 --> 02:19:10.838]  It's, oh, we're going to put microchips in people, but just the pedophiles.
[02:19:10.878 --> 02:19:11.379]  Well, good.
[02:19:11.519 --> 02:19:12.399]  Kill them, pedophiles.
[02:19:12.619 --> 02:19:20.142]  But no, see, they're setting the precedent for, oh, we're going to arrest you because your website wasn't accessible for the blind because we care about the blind.
[02:19:20.202 --> 02:19:23.603]  No, it's about government saying what you can and can't do with your free speech.
[02:19:23.963 --> 02:19:27.085]  And now they're starting to do that here in this country, not just in England.
[02:19:27.105 --> 02:19:28.065]  We're on the same page.
[02:19:29.261 --> 02:19:37.347]  I'm not really sure how much they care about the blind, but the other side of the coin is, of course, if it's a government website.
[02:19:38.247 --> 02:19:51.617]  If it's a government website that's taxpayer-funded, I bear on the side that it probably should be accessible to everyone, and they should make every attempt, every effort.
[02:19:52.170 --> 02:19:54.571]  Well, that's why there's the lawsuits with the voting machines, and I agree.
[02:19:54.591 --> 02:19:57.833]  If it's something they're making you do, then it should certainly work.
[02:19:58.453 --> 02:20:03.935]  And look, I've had folks that are blind tell me that our websites, Prison Planet InfoWars, are real good because everything's text.
[02:20:04.095 --> 02:20:04.636]  They sure are.
[02:20:04.836 --> 02:20:05.956]  Or about 90% of it is.
[02:20:06.036 --> 02:20:10.638]  But in England, they're saying if you have a picture, it better have text embedded.
[02:20:10.659 --> 02:20:12.319]  Well, we don't have the time to do that.
[02:20:12.599 --> 02:20:14.780]  We can't do that, or we'll just get rid of pictures.
[02:20:15.501 --> 02:20:18.062]  Not everything in the world is going to be accessible to the blind.
[02:20:18.616 --> 02:20:21.417]  It's an unfortunate fact of life.
[02:20:21.957 --> 02:20:23.418]  Well, you say you've been on my website.
[02:20:23.558 --> 02:20:25.199]  Is it easy to navigate?
[02:20:25.719 --> 02:20:26.839]  I've been on your website.
[02:20:26.879 --> 02:20:31.561]  I've read things, read news items off of InfoWars.com.
[02:20:31.661 --> 02:20:35.243]  I've been on PrisonPlanet.com and read things there.
[02:20:35.763 --> 02:20:37.304]  Yeah, hey, it works fine.
[02:20:37.444 --> 02:20:40.525]  But is there a lot of stuff you can't read, or how much of it doesn't have text?
[02:20:43.726 --> 02:20:45.947]  Well, the stuff I'm interested in reading is all text.
[02:20:46.969 --> 02:20:53.110]  Yeah, but they're saying in England, if you've got a picture or a flash animation, it better have text on it.
[02:20:54.431 --> 02:20:55.471]  Well, I don't know.
[02:20:55.551 --> 02:20:56.051]  I don't care.
[02:20:56.071 --> 02:20:57.651]  I don't really think it's that big of a deal.
[02:20:57.731 --> 02:21:00.652]  I mean, the news items and things that I want to see are all there.
[02:21:01.392 --> 02:21:02.692]  They're all there for me, you know.
[02:21:02.832 --> 02:21:06.293]  Well, yeah, but for sites like mine that are almost exclusively text, you know.
[02:21:06.513 --> 02:21:09.394]  But the problem is, again, they will selectively enforce it.
[02:21:10.314 --> 02:21:11.774]  And on top of it, you just said it.
[02:21:11.834 --> 02:21:12.815]  I mean, why didn't I say that?
[02:21:12.855 --> 02:21:13.315]  It's simple.
[02:21:13.775 --> 02:21:14.715]  It's your property.
[02:21:16.001 --> 02:21:18.162]  It's your property, and that's the thing.
[02:21:18.402 --> 02:21:22.885]  You know, this country was built on the idea of private property.
[02:21:22.945 --> 02:21:27.567]  That was one of the tenets of people like John Locke.
[02:21:28.167 --> 02:21:35.651]  Those were some of the originators of the philosophies of the founding fathers.
[02:21:36.431 --> 02:21:39.573]  So, yes, this country is built on the idea of private property.
[02:21:41.403 --> 02:21:42.184]  You know what's interesting?
[02:21:42.204 --> 02:21:58.655]  There's a lot of folks who can't hear or can't see, and they know more about the New World Order than I do, and then you've got people that have got all their faculties except for their sixth sense or their discernment, and they're totally deaf, dumb, and blind, but they've got eyes to see and ears to hear, as Christ said.
[02:21:58.675 --> 02:22:02.758]  Have you not found that those are some of the blindest people out there?
[02:22:04.339 --> 02:22:06.241]  I would agree with you there.
[02:22:07.461 --> 02:22:09.143]  I call them the great unwashed.
[02:22:09.483 --> 02:22:10.924]  Most people just are asleep
[02:22:12.392 --> 02:22:19.473]  But why have I found statistically that the blind and people that can't hear, why are they generally more awake to the New World Order on average than others?
[02:22:21.154 --> 02:22:30.615]  Because we're forced by circumstance to use what we have more effectively.
[02:22:30.956 --> 02:22:35.216]  If you turn away from a TV and just listen to it, you can hear the sickening manipulation.
[02:22:35.596 --> 02:22:38.677]  Or if you turn the volume off and just watch it, you can see it.
[02:22:39.671 --> 02:22:40.011]  No doubt.
[02:22:40.332 --> 02:22:43.113]  Have you not found that just listening to it, you can really pick up on stuff?
[02:22:44.054 --> 02:22:45.555]  I don't listen to TV.
[02:22:45.955 --> 02:22:47.536]  I don't have one.
[02:22:47.556 --> 02:22:48.137]  Well, I have one.
[02:22:48.157 --> 02:22:48.877]  It's in a closet.
[02:22:49.177 --> 02:22:49.578]  I hear you.
[02:22:49.618 --> 02:22:50.858]  Is there anything else you wanted to add?
[02:22:50.878 --> 02:22:52.560]  I think that's it.
[02:22:52.620 --> 02:22:57.463]  The touchscreens are a bad idea, especially touchscreen voting, but there are technical solutions to that.
[02:22:57.523 --> 02:22:58.844]  I could go into some of that.
[02:22:58.924 --> 02:23:00.625]  Okay, well, go into that on the other side real quick.
[02:23:00.765 --> 02:23:03.967]  We'll be right back.
[02:23:05.208 --> 02:23:06.128]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.609 --> 02:23:08.130]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.116 --> 02:23:11.938]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.060 --> 02:23:22.585]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[02:23:22.845 --> 02:23:29.329]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because it's the best your body can use for good health and vitality.
[02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:31.331]  That's purehealthsystems.com.
[02:23:36.013 --> 02:23:38.635]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:23:39.216 --> 02:23:42.138]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:47.282 --> 02:23:59.993]  Yes, the visually impaired have sued in Florida because the touchscreens basically aren't designed for the blind.
[02:24:01.754 --> 02:24:02.775]  And obviously...
[02:24:03.550 --> 02:24:05.591]  Chris in Oklahoma was saying that he had some solutions for this.
[02:24:34.701 --> 02:24:36.061]  At least for one facet of this.
[02:24:36.102 --> 02:24:39.782]  Go ahead, Chris, and finish up what you were saying.
[02:24:40.702 --> 02:24:53.085]  The most obvious solution is to put some sort of a communications port on the voting machine by which a blind person could hook up a computer to it who is voting that way.
[02:24:54.665 --> 02:24:58.586]  He could actually communicate with the machine and submit his vote.
[02:24:59.164 --> 02:25:00.385]  That shouldn't be too hard to do.
[02:25:00.465 --> 02:25:01.586]  It wouldn't be hard to do at all.
[02:25:01.606 --> 02:25:04.229]  Yeah, but that's what Diebold's doing to the back door.
[02:25:04.469 --> 02:25:17.522]  But what about just having an audio input where you put a headset on so folks wouldn't hear what your vote was, but then when you put the cursor over the proper area, it would tell you and then read to you what the ballot said?
[02:25:17.542 --> 02:25:19.664]  I mean, that software is out there.
[02:25:19.684 --> 02:25:21.746]  It shouldn't be too hard for them to put that in there.
[02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:24.110]  No, it wouldn't.
[02:25:24.411 --> 02:25:27.793]  I don't see why they can't just have keyboards on these machines.
[02:25:27.813 --> 02:25:29.195]  Why do they have to have touch screens?
[02:25:29.575 --> 02:25:31.897]  Are they really that more efficient?
[02:25:31.997 --> 02:25:45.488]  I mean, if you had keyboards, you could easily have... Well, sir, about 70% of the population doesn't know where Iraq is, doesn't know who the vice president is under Clinton or under Bush.
[02:25:45.588 --> 02:25:48.910]  They have no idea even where North America is, and I'm not being sarcastic.
[02:25:49.131 --> 02:25:51.152]  I mean, we're here a thinking audience.
[02:25:51.172 --> 02:25:52.053]  I'm not being elitist.
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:53.440]  Sure.
[02:25:53.460 --> 02:25:54.501]  I want to make another point.
[02:25:54.541 --> 02:25:55.741]  You've talked on here about
[02:26:22.321 --> 02:26:30.722]  These touchscreen machines being especially vulnerable to fraud, various forms of voter fraud.
[02:26:31.263 --> 02:26:41.624]  Well, they have back doors built into them, and almost all the heads of the companies are former deputy directors of the CIA, and they've been caught by the media in meetings bragging about manipulating our votes.
[02:26:41.704 --> 02:26:44.525]  I mean, it's basically out there that this is a fraud.
[02:26:44.545 --> 02:26:51.506]  Yeah, they could... Of course, there are technical solutions to that, too, you know, using cryptographic...
[02:26:52.256 --> 02:26:58.263]  Well, of course, but the things are designed with back doors and wireless connections back to the companies.
[02:26:59.084 --> 02:27:01.187]  They're designed to steal elections.
[02:27:01.868 --> 02:27:03.530]  They're designed with no security.
[02:27:06.468 --> 02:27:08.489]  These things are just a bad idea in general.
[02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:09.290]  They are.
[02:27:09.450 --> 02:27:19.677]  Well, I mean, the League of Women Voters is arguing against Congressman Rush Holt's bill to have a paper ballot generated by the touchscreen so there can be a recount?
[02:27:19.957 --> 02:27:22.078]  I mean, they want to get rid of recounts altogether?
[02:27:22.278 --> 02:27:23.439]  Is that what America's about?
[02:27:23.459 --> 02:27:26.121]  Does that not prove they're trying to steal the election?
[02:27:26.321 --> 02:27:27.922]  The League of Criminal Voters?
[02:27:27.962 --> 02:27:30.764]  I mean, the League of Women Election Stealers?
[02:27:30.864 --> 02:27:32.745]  I mean, the League of Communism?
[02:27:32.805 --> 02:27:34.246]  I mean, the League of Women Voters is...
[02:27:34.526 --> 02:27:35.027]  Right.
[02:27:35.548 --> 02:27:44.542]  Well, that was just all I really had to say.
[02:27:45.023 --> 02:27:46.044]  All right, good to hear from you.
[02:27:46.686 --> 02:27:47.407]  God bless you, sir.
[02:27:47.467 --> 02:27:48.108]  Thank you for the call.
[02:27:49.216 --> 02:27:50.738]  Let's talk to Rob in Wyoming.
[02:27:50.798 --> 02:27:51.639]  Rob, go ahead.
[02:27:51.659 --> 02:27:52.159]  Hey, Alex.
[02:27:52.399 --> 02:27:55.162]  I wish you'd just come out of your shell and tell us what you really think.
[02:27:55.382 --> 02:27:56.603]  Well, they're disgusting.
[02:27:56.623 --> 02:27:57.884]  They're disgusting.
[02:27:57.924 --> 02:27:58.805]  They make me sick.
[02:27:58.985 --> 02:27:59.226]  Me too.
[02:27:59.246 --> 02:28:03.710]  They've been caught all over the country stealing elections, and now they want to take my right to vote away.
[02:28:03.890 --> 02:28:06.132]  They want to take my record away.
[02:28:06.292 --> 02:28:08.574]  That makes me real mad.
[02:28:08.594 --> 02:28:10.236]  I'm mad at them.
[02:28:10.436 --> 02:28:12.258]  They're destroying America.
[02:28:12.278 --> 02:28:14.280]  They should make us angry.
[02:28:15.003 --> 02:28:18.144]  Yeah, they had some reference to it on PBS the other day.
[02:28:18.204 --> 02:28:19.184]  Like, it was a good thing.
[02:28:19.224 --> 02:28:20.424]  Like, oh, no, it was the news.
[02:28:21.025 --> 02:28:25.426]  California, they want to... Oh, it was discriminating, but don't worry.
[02:28:25.466 --> 02:28:26.386]  We've got a problem.
[02:28:26.406 --> 02:28:27.306]  We've got a reaction.
[02:28:27.346 --> 02:28:28.266]  We've got a solution.
[02:28:28.607 --> 02:28:30.847]  Touch screens with no record.
[02:28:30.947 --> 02:28:32.107]  It's so good.
[02:28:32.508 --> 02:28:35.928]  Well, they phrase it like they've got to bring it up to current technology.
[02:28:36.008 --> 02:28:37.849]  It's old-fashioned obsolete, you know.
[02:28:39.427 --> 02:28:41.469]  Of course, there can't be a record or receipt.
[02:28:41.509 --> 02:28:44.471]  You get that at an ATM at the bank, but not here.
[02:28:44.852 --> 02:28:48.154]  Oh, we can't do that.
[02:28:48.275 --> 02:28:50.376]  Having a receipt is old-fashioned, obsolete.
[02:28:50.416 --> 02:28:57.722]  Diebold was caught, the big company with the CIA, accessing it in the 2002 election in a county that had it, manipulating things.
[02:28:57.903 --> 02:28:59.484]  They've been caught doing it.
[02:29:00.464 --> 02:29:04.846]  Hey, I thought it was real interesting that you had Doctor Who theme song there.
[02:29:05.266 --> 02:29:08.387]  Yeah, by the way, I need to get in there and play it.
[02:29:08.407 --> 02:29:09.968]  The president reminds me of the doctor.
[02:29:10.948 --> 02:29:19.072]  No matter what he looks like, he might be a little old man or an Ichabod Crane type or a dandy or something, but it's always the same guy.
[02:29:20.276 --> 02:29:22.978]  No matter how he's dressed, how he presents himself.
[02:29:23.138 --> 02:29:23.479]  That's it.
[02:29:23.519 --> 02:29:24.560]  It's always Dr. Who.
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:25.120]  That's right.
[02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:25.460]  Right.
[02:29:26.141 --> 02:29:27.662]  It's Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton.
[02:29:27.923 --> 02:29:28.263]  Exactly.
[02:29:28.283 --> 02:29:30.565]  Well, I kind of go along with you.
[02:29:30.865 --> 02:29:35.129]  I think Reagan found out who the bosses were when he was offered.
[02:29:35.149 --> 02:29:35.429]  Oh, yeah.
[02:29:35.449 --> 02:29:43.676]  He came out and said, yeah, I mean, Reagan came out and said, I want to cut taxes, and I'm going to, the IRS, we're going to get rid of it, and boom.
[02:29:43.796 --> 02:29:48.520]  But his son, Michael Reagan, sure can't do enough for the New World Order as a phony conservative, can he?
[02:29:49.426 --> 02:29:52.469]  Telling people that they don't have the right to travel, that's a privilege.
[02:29:52.629 --> 02:29:55.231]  These all come from legal fictions.
[02:29:55.311 --> 02:29:59.775]  It's legal fictions that exist by privilege, not natural human beings.
[02:30:00.436 --> 02:30:02.057]  It's amazing to watch these guys.
[02:30:02.718 --> 02:30:07.002]  Well, have you heard of USA vs. Coogland this year in Tennessee?
[02:30:08.063 --> 02:30:08.823]  It's a real victory.
[02:30:08.843 --> 02:30:10.745]  It was posted on Rents.com for a while.
[02:30:11.434 --> 02:30:16.015]  Oh, the woman who sued, did the IRS try to arrest her and it got thrown out?
[02:30:16.315 --> 02:30:18.476]  Well, the judge said, I don't work for the IRS.
[02:30:19.076 --> 02:30:22.556]  And then the jury came out and said that she's not guilty.
[02:30:22.596 --> 02:30:23.777]  Yeah, I covered that.
[02:30:24.077 --> 02:30:27.858]  Well, now with this, you know, all the chess pieces are moving right into place.
[02:30:27.898 --> 02:30:29.198]  It's so transparent.
[02:30:30.138 --> 02:30:31.778]  Oh, we've got to have the U.N.
[02:30:31.918 --> 02:30:39.280]  come down and establish basically a base over a huge oil supply because a global army needs a huge oil supply.
[02:30:40.126 --> 02:30:45.830]  You know, it's not for you to drive around in your car except to be more productive on the plantation for the big machine.
[02:30:46.090 --> 02:30:58.119]  And then they're going to have a portion of the satellite tracker box tax go to the county, the city, so they get behind it and force it through the federal government, and they're saying about 10% of that satellite tracker tax is going to go to the U.N.
[02:30:58.419 --> 02:30:59.660]  And you're for it, aren't you?
[02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:02.382]  Because it's feeding the starving children.
[02:31:02.722 --> 02:31:04.784]  Well, that in itself, that tax going to the U.N.
[02:31:04.924 --> 02:31:09.407]  is proof that they consider themselves as agents of a foreign power.
[02:31:09.867 --> 02:31:14.551]  Well, I mean, the Supreme Court has told us, including the Republican Supreme Court, that we follow the U.N.
[02:31:14.631 --> 02:31:15.672]  That's our authority.
[02:31:16.272 --> 02:31:24.618]  Not the Declaration of Independence, not the Bill of Rights, and then these neocons get on the radio and go, anybody that says there's a new world order is a kook.
[02:31:24.799 --> 02:31:25.239]  Oh, yeah.
[02:31:25.619 --> 02:31:26.820]  That's the kook detector.
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:27.881]  Go back to sleep.
[02:31:27.981 --> 02:31:29.042]  It doesn't exist.
[02:31:29.342 --> 02:31:33.105]  What do you think of that, what's his name, William Kristol?
[02:31:34.131 --> 02:31:34.932]  On Fox.
[02:31:35.532 --> 02:31:43.796]  Well, his father was the head of the Communist Fourth International, according to Ron Paul, and according to the National Post of Canada.
[02:31:43.836 --> 02:31:44.577]  They're socialistic.
[02:31:44.597 --> 02:31:48.679]  They go, wow, Bush is actually a Trotskyite, and look at all these Trotskyites.
[02:31:48.699 --> 02:31:49.919]  We actually like him.
[02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:52.741]  Well, they give you an alternative.
[02:31:53.101 --> 02:31:55.022]  They've opened up this huge can of worms.
[02:31:55.062 --> 02:31:58.164]  They went and knocked down a hornet's nest on purpose.
[02:31:58.840 --> 02:32:05.125]  And then Bush says in this Fox interview, he says, oh, I don't go along with these people that say leave a sleeping dog lie.
[02:32:05.425 --> 02:32:11.929]  Yeah, those people say don't knock down Hornet's Nest for no reason unless you have an incentive, you have an agenda.
[02:32:11.949 --> 02:32:21.256]  Well, look, D2OG, Rumsfeld's little provocateur army, admits, this is the stuff that he classified, that they want to go kill Arabs to get them to attack us so then we have a pretext to attack them.
[02:32:21.276 --> 02:32:25.119]  Yeah, he's knocking Hornet's Nest down and then turning around saying, hey,
[02:32:25.439 --> 02:32:27.101]  Folks, sorry I knocked down a hornet's nest.
[02:32:27.481 --> 02:32:28.822]  There'll be more attacks now.
[02:32:29.743 --> 02:32:31.865]  And sorry, we're going to have to take all your rides.
[02:32:31.985 --> 02:32:33.426]  Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
[02:32:33.446 --> 02:32:34.968]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:32:35.008 --> 02:32:35.869]  I appreciate it, buddy.
[02:32:36.529 --> 02:32:38.591]  Let's talk to Richard in Tennessee.
[02:32:38.651 --> 02:32:39.412]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:32:40.893 --> 02:32:41.414]  Yes, Alex.
[02:32:42.535 --> 02:32:43.296]  Yes, welcome.
[02:32:43.856 --> 02:32:48.020]  I love your show, and I'm finally getting my wife kind of informed in your...
[02:32:48.712 --> 02:32:52.996]  Ideal thinking by leaving documents just laying around the house that I print off off the website.
[02:32:53.236 --> 02:32:54.898]  You mean you're deprogramming her?
[02:32:55.338 --> 02:32:55.859]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:32:55.879 --> 02:32:57.200]  You're removing the blinders.
[02:32:58.101 --> 02:33:00.423]  She's a free creature now.
[02:33:01.083 --> 02:33:03.946]  Exactly, and what's nice about it is now she's catching things.
[02:33:03.986 --> 02:33:14.115]  For some reason I admitted I was watching a Pauly Shore movie, In the Army Now, and you might have found this before, but they're right in the middle of the movie talking about UN Resolution 911.
[02:33:16.340 --> 02:33:18.041]  And I didn't know if there was ever a U.N.
[02:33:18.081 --> 02:33:18.722]  resolution.
[02:33:19.322 --> 02:33:21.904]  It's the movie where he's invading Libya as a private.
[02:33:23.245 --> 02:33:25.006]  And it's just kind of stuff from the mid-'90s.
[02:33:25.166 --> 02:33:27.027]  Yeah, I've seen part of that.
[02:33:27.587 --> 02:33:31.050]  Yeah, I didn't know if that was ever a real resolution or just kind of thrown in there.
[02:33:31.230 --> 02:33:31.630]  I don't know.
[02:33:31.650 --> 02:33:33.551]  When I saw that, I wanted to check it out a few years ago.
[02:33:33.591 --> 02:33:34.312]  I didn't check it out.
[02:33:35.032 --> 02:33:35.312]  Okay.
[02:33:35.552 --> 02:33:36.993]  Well, that's about all I had.
[02:33:37.053 --> 02:33:37.994]  I have nothing new.
[02:33:38.214 --> 02:33:39.375]  Oh, and there's one other thing.
[02:33:39.435 --> 02:33:42.557]  A lady here in Knoxville is now suing against the Patriot Act.
[02:33:43.152 --> 02:33:43.812]  Oh, good!
[02:33:44.152 --> 02:33:48.494]  And they had a big forum down here, and they had about a couple hundred people at the city county building.
[02:33:49.494 --> 02:33:53.956]  And one protester saying the Patriot Act was good, and 200 people saying it was evil.
[02:33:53.996 --> 02:33:56.677]  But I'm sure the paper spent half their time on the one person.
[02:33:57.237 --> 02:33:57.797]  Right, they did.
[02:33:58.597 --> 02:33:59.037]  Exactly.
[02:33:59.838 --> 02:34:02.339]  Well, that's all I had today, and once again, thanks for your show.
[02:34:02.639 --> 02:34:04.239]  All right, appreciate the call, sir.
[02:34:04.299 --> 02:34:07.640]  Let's talk now to Andy in Arizona.
[02:34:09.981 --> 02:34:10.421]  Where is it?
[02:34:10.481 --> 02:34:10.942]  Indiana?
[02:34:10.962 --> 02:34:11.382]  Go ahead.
[02:34:11.402 --> 02:34:12.462]  Hi, Alex.
[02:34:12.762 --> 02:34:13.703]  Hello, my friend.
[02:34:14.003 --> 02:34:14.783]  Hey, love your show.
[02:34:15.564 --> 02:34:19.966]  I also listen to you when you are on the Bill Bossier Show in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[02:34:20.166 --> 02:34:21.086]  Yeah, Bill's a great guy.
[02:34:21.406 --> 02:34:21.907]  Yeah, he is.
[02:34:22.407 --> 02:34:25.128]  You do a good job when you're being interviewed on a show like that.
[02:34:25.168 --> 02:34:28.050]  You're powerful and you make good points, so keep that up.
[02:34:28.850 --> 02:34:35.133]  Hey, I just want to make a couple comments about a comment a previous caller made yesterday.
[02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:38.140]  Actually, you made the comment to him.
[02:34:38.180 --> 02:34:42.021]  You said that we're dumb compared to our founding fathers, and that's true.
[02:34:42.081 --> 02:34:43.321]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[02:34:44.322 --> 02:34:49.162]  Compared to previous generations, this generation is dumb and it's lazy.
[02:34:49.703 --> 02:35:00.805]  Basically, all we're interested in is our Nintendos and PlayStations, and it would be easy for the government to take our rights from us because for the most part, I don't think the majority of Americans would fight for it.
[02:35:00.925 --> 02:35:02.285]  Look, they have polls.
[02:35:03.672 --> 02:35:08.855]  Where the majority of school children, I mean high school, don't know who the vice president is, don't know where Iraq is.
[02:35:09.115 --> 02:35:09.896]  Adults don't know.
[02:35:10.156 --> 02:35:15.179]  So when you try to talk to one of these adults, when they laugh at you, it's because they know they're stupid.
[02:35:15.539 --> 02:35:16.980]  They think you're trying to show off.
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:21.322]  See, to them, knowing what the Fourth Amendment is, is an uppity thing.
[02:35:21.382 --> 02:35:24.904]  Look, we've got one that can read!
[02:35:25.164 --> 02:35:27.786]  Where does he think he is?
[02:35:28.466 --> 02:35:32.887]  I'm against Batman with the thing on head.
[02:35:33.287 --> 02:35:40.309]  President good, we be attacked, we give up right to be safe.
[02:35:40.629 --> 02:35:42.109]  They just don't understand it.
[02:35:43.370 --> 02:35:52.932]  I was in the military with a guy that immigrated from a foreign country, and the sad thing is he knew more about our constitutions and the working of our government than anybody.
[02:35:53.698 --> 02:35:54.958]  Most American citizens do.
[02:35:54.998 --> 02:35:56.039]  Most people that were born here.
[02:35:56.059 --> 02:35:58.540]  Because he had to take a test in order to become a citizen.
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:00.881]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:36:00.901 --> 02:36:02.061]  We got a Fourth Amendment.
[02:36:02.741 --> 02:36:03.681]  We got a Fifth Amendment.
[02:36:03.782 --> 02:36:06.242]  How does the IRS come take a Seventh Amendment?
[02:36:06.502 --> 02:36:12.024]  How does the IRS come and take your bank account without indicting you, without a grand jury, without... Where's the trial?
[02:36:12.344 --> 02:36:13.865]  Folks, that's not freedom!
[02:36:14.525 --> 02:36:15.546]  No, there is no freedom.
[02:36:15.866 --> 02:36:16.686]  I'll tell you another thing.
[02:36:16.726 --> 02:36:19.107]  I hear a lot of people talking about the...
[02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:20.440]  Oh, I bet.
[02:36:42.818 --> 02:36:51.742]  He told me about how his friends over there were losing their limbs from frostbite, how they had frozen C-rations at best.
[02:36:53.042 --> 02:37:01.866]  He said that when they were able to go back off the front, the Red Cross would be there to serve hot meals, but they would charge the troops for the meals.
[02:37:01.886 --> 02:37:03.846]  The Red Cross is the trash of Earth.
[02:37:04.387 --> 02:37:06.447]  The filthiest of the filthiest trash.
[02:37:06.928 --> 02:37:07.988]  Absolute vermin.
[02:37:08.832 --> 02:37:11.315]  So, you know, I just want to give credit where credit's due.
[02:37:11.855 --> 02:37:19.102]  Some of these veterans that have served in Korea, Vietnam, World War II, have seen some horrendous, just diabolical combat.
[02:37:19.263 --> 02:37:21.164]  Well, and on purpose.
[02:37:21.224 --> 02:37:23.186]  They just don't care about the troops.
[02:37:23.747 --> 02:37:32.476]  Korea was probably our worst war for America in casualties and everything, and you never hear about it because they weren't a bunch of whiners.
[02:37:33.192 --> 02:37:33.813]  Yes, you're right.
[02:37:33.833 --> 02:37:34.995]  These are amazing individuals.
[02:37:35.355 --> 02:37:36.837]  They were tough people, tough people.
[02:37:36.877 --> 02:37:38.700]  There's nobody like that in our current generation.
[02:37:39.141 --> 02:37:40.723]  My dad told me of some of the combat.
[02:37:40.743 --> 02:37:41.965]  They fought against the Chinese.
[02:37:42.005 --> 02:37:46.231]  He said they would be mowing those Chinese down with machine guns until the barrels melted.
[02:37:47.051 --> 02:37:48.272]  We just extended it by a year.
[02:37:48.312 --> 02:37:48.612]  Yeah.
[02:37:48.672 --> 02:37:50.373]  So they're going to be getting that 18-month.
[02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:09.585]  At least they get email, and I'd say for the most part their food's a heck of a lot better and they're not dying of frostbite.
[02:38:09.706 --> 02:38:17.572]  Well, my whole point is I do support the troops, and they shouldn't get charged for their meals when they're in the sick bay, and that's wrong.
[02:38:17.652 --> 02:38:22.717]  And it just shows how Halliburton's going to get tens of billions, but the troops have got to pay for their food.
[02:38:23.117 --> 02:38:23.377]  Yeah.
[02:38:23.738 --> 02:38:25.059]  And breathe the bleeding uranium.
[02:38:25.099 --> 02:38:25.699]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:26.080]  Yeah.
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:27.421]  I really do appreciate it.
[02:38:27.461 --> 02:38:29.883]  No more calls because I need to get to some news here, folks.
[02:38:33.228 --> 02:38:38.354]  The United Farm Workers of America President Arturo Rodriguez is hailing Bush.
[02:38:38.855 --> 02:38:40.777]  This Bush wants blanket total amnesty.
[02:38:41.117 --> 02:38:43.881]  You got the Communist Farm Bureau loving Bush.
[02:38:44.501 --> 02:38:45.543]  Of course you do!
[02:38:46.444 --> 02:38:49.848]  Breakthrough near for illegal immigrants and farmers.
[02:38:51.391 --> 02:39:01.298]  Farmers and farm workers Tuesday uncorked a potentially groundbreaking compromise that offers hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants the prospect of becoming legal U.S.
[02:39:01.358 --> 02:39:10.625]  residents following years of discussions that were sidetracked by terrorism fears and stuck on some perennial controversies.
[02:39:10.705 --> 02:39:14.868]  Negotiations presented what were uniformly described as the historic deal.
[02:39:15.518 --> 02:39:16.558]  This is absolutely horrible.
[02:39:42.580 --> 02:39:45.581]  And there's no reason any of us should put up with it.
[02:39:46.282 --> 02:39:47.322]  I promised I'd read this.
[02:39:47.342 --> 02:39:49.403]  I'll read it quickly, but I'm going to have to bleep out a lot of this.
[02:39:49.863 --> 02:39:50.823]  This is from the Drudge Report.
[02:39:50.863 --> 02:39:52.444]  It's on Infowars.com right now.
[02:39:52.804 --> 02:39:57.446]  Campaign chases erotic, maple-thorpe nude photos of Schwarzenegger.
[02:39:58.087 --> 02:40:03.449]  As the final days of the historic California recall election near, another historic development has unfolded behind the scenes.
[02:40:03.809 --> 02:40:08.571]  Campaign operatives are scrambling to contain full nude erotic photographs taken by...
[02:40:10.043 --> 02:40:14.367]  Controversial Robert Mapplethorpe full nude photographs of Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:40:14.968 --> 02:40:21.875]  The shocking nudes of Republican Schwarzenegger have been kept under lock and key at the estate of Robert Mapplethorpe in New York.
[02:40:22.676 --> 02:40:30.804]  And it continues to report Mapplethorpe, whose infamous self-portrait with a bullwhip inserted bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep,
[02:40:31.793 --> 02:40:43.135]  As many photographs of bleep and men bleep engaging in bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, Schwarzenegger, one of the favorite subjects, sources close to the late artist tell the Drudge Report.
[02:40:43.896 --> 02:40:46.456]  Voters have never seen an election official in such detail.
[02:40:46.896 --> 02:40:48.756]  Oh, yeah, Robert Maple for him.
[02:40:48.777 --> 02:40:55.998]  He's the guy that liked to put crucifixion in urine and worse and like you to pay for it.
[02:40:57.236 --> 02:40:58.237]  And that's part of the course.
[02:40:58.257 --> 02:41:03.839]  You don't get into the, well, you know, standard fare at the Grove, just old naked men running around frolicking.
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:06.381]  You're Christian conservative leaders, folks.
[02:41:06.761 --> 02:41:08.682]  No wonder people aren't coming to Christ.
[02:41:09.275 --> 02:41:11.416]  Because they see that and think that's Christianity.
[02:41:11.637 --> 02:41:12.617]  The sickening joke.
[02:41:12.637 --> 02:41:24.905]  These guys with all their racehorses and their prostitutes and their 1.4 million gambling bills and they're running around naked in the woods and the male prostitute shipped in by the jet load of Bohemian Grove, according to mainstream news.
[02:41:25.506 --> 02:41:29.548]  That's your Christian conservatism.
[02:41:30.509 --> 02:41:33.771]  Giant carts of male prostitutes.
[02:41:35.882 --> 02:41:40.209]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:40.409 --> 02:41:44.836]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:44.976 --> 02:41:49.343]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:49.363 --> 02:41:50.745]  The New World Order.
[02:41:52.527 --> 02:41:56.750]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:56.810 --> 02:42:03.755]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:03.875 --> 02:42:05.897]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:06.257 --> 02:42:16.689]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:16.869 --> 02:42:22.175]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:43:35.072 --> 02:43:39.053]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[02:43:39.513 --> 02:43:46.495]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.
[02:43:46.935 --> 02:43:51.037]  With an ozone generator, you can kill bacteria and viruses in your drinking water.
[02:43:51.557 --> 02:43:54.819]  Get rid of that stale air in your house that keeps recirculating.
[02:43:55.199 --> 02:44:00.041]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.

[02:44:41.238 --> 02:44:42.158]  I won't back down.
[02:44:44.239 --> 02:44:45.120]  Welcome back, folks.
[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:46.200]  Final segment.
[02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:49.602]  Again, we do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 and back from 9 to midnight.
[02:44:50.142 --> 02:44:56.605]  On the global shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20 and at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[02:44:56.966 --> 02:45:03.749]  And, of course, on a growing list of wonderful AM and FM affiliates, the internet at InfoWars.com.
[02:45:05.010 --> 02:45:05.150]  U.S.
[02:45:05.210 --> 02:45:07.511]  troops detain AP photographers.
[02:45:08.294 --> 02:45:09.495]  And it's an AP article.
[02:45:09.515 --> 02:45:25.170]  They knew they were AP reporters, and they detained them, wouldn't let them have water, slapped them around a bit, made them stand around for three hours in temperatures of 110 degrees, wouldn't let them have water, cussed at them, yelled at them.
[02:45:26.271 --> 02:45:27.452]  They're lucky, because U.S.
[02:45:27.492 --> 02:45:30.315]  clears soldiers in killing of Reuters cameraman.
[02:45:31.129 --> 02:45:34.072]  This guy had total authorization and found some mass graves of U.S.
[02:45:34.092 --> 02:45:34.492]  troops.
[02:45:34.852 --> 02:45:35.613]  There's video of him.
[02:45:35.633 --> 02:45:38.976]  They didn't even take the video of the tank driving right up and then just blasting this guy.
[02:45:39.436 --> 02:45:42.358]  I mean, he videotaped them killing him.
[02:45:42.378 --> 02:45:43.519]  And there's an admitted U.S.
[02:45:43.559 --> 02:45:45.941]  government plan to, quote, kill reporters to keep them out of there.
[02:45:46.001 --> 02:45:47.142]  That's on the website.
[02:45:48.143 --> 02:45:48.363]  U.S.
[02:45:48.403 --> 02:45:53.968]  soldiers, again, detain AP photographers and their driver deny them water.
[02:45:53.988 --> 02:45:57.331]  911 panel seeks more documents from White House.
[02:45:57.471 --> 02:45:58.592]  Sure, in that staged event.
[02:45:59.255 --> 02:46:02.818]  And the Bush administration has significantly improved cooperation with the Independent Commission.
[02:46:02.858 --> 02:46:03.839]  Independent Commission, folks.
[02:46:03.859 --> 02:46:06.941]  It's like having Al Capone investigate Don Carleone.
[02:46:08.222 --> 02:46:12.626]  Masarov again fakes terror arrest for political leverage.
[02:46:12.766 --> 02:46:13.987]  This is the Asia Times.
[02:46:14.127 --> 02:46:14.807]  Big story.
[02:46:14.847 --> 02:46:17.750]  Karachi disliked the magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat.
[02:46:17.810 --> 02:46:19.151]  Pakistan President General...
[02:46:20.608 --> 02:46:40.402]  The lengthy article goes into how it's totally staged, and how our government arrests people, claims they're terrorists, and then turns out they're CIA, and then knows that we don't even notice, and ten months later says they capture them again and again.
[02:46:40.623 --> 02:46:42.064]  They don't even change the names.
[02:46:42.084 --> 02:46:46.407]  They're practicing open lies to condition you and set the precedent.
[02:46:48.753 --> 02:46:50.254]  I mean, I don't know if you get what I'm saying here.
[02:46:50.274 --> 02:46:51.875]  This is so massive.
[02:46:54.216 --> 02:46:57.097]  CIA paid mullahs to counter anti-U.S.
[02:46:57.137 --> 02:46:58.237]  feeling out of the Scotsman.
[02:46:58.257 --> 02:47:06.261]  The CIA paid mullahs and created fake Islamic religious leaders to preach a moderate message and counter anti-American sentiment in the Arab world after September 11th attacks.
[02:47:07.141 --> 02:47:17.986]  Just like they created the Taliban and Al-Qaeda to radicalize, the Washington Post reported, shipped over $10 million worth of books, radical hadiths, about how to kill Americans to the small children of the Middle East.
[02:47:19.870 --> 02:47:34.794]  And it goes on, and the CIA at war, Ronald Kessler, an investigative reporter and author of several books about the CIA and the FBI, also details espionage activity in Iraq, which supported the March invasion that toppled the Iraq president, paying off the leaders and paying off al-Qaeda.
[02:47:35.154 --> 02:47:43.276]  And now they are reporting mainstream news that Saddam was flown out to Belarus, and that's being confirmed, but that came out before the war and after the war.
[02:47:44.316 --> 02:47:45.116]  Totally staged.
[02:47:45.176 --> 02:47:45.996]  He was CIA in 1958.
[02:47:46.136 --> 02:47:48.497]  Fell out of favor, finally made the deal.
[02:47:49.842 --> 02:47:53.705]  Organizers say Matrix, Big Brother database, would be tied with the CIA.
[02:47:53.745 --> 02:47:54.565]  It's called the Matrix.
[02:47:54.945 --> 02:47:56.426]  Associated Press admitting that.
[02:47:59.008 --> 02:48:00.088]  And it just continues.
[02:48:00.168 --> 02:48:05.292]  Oh, by the way, all the NASA panel has resigned over that situation.
[02:48:06.933 --> 02:48:13.677]  There's been a rash of hepatitis in the Indian tribes of South America after they got their vaccinations, so the answer is more vaccinations.
[02:48:14.797 --> 02:48:16.698]  Man, I tell you, we're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:16.718 --> 02:48:17.419]  We're out of time.
[02:48:19.427 --> 02:48:24.589]  I hope that everybody will get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, The Masters of Terror.
[02:48:24.609 --> 02:48:25.550]  They're all great films.
[02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:27.130]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Groves.
[02:48:27.150 --> 02:48:30.252]  You can see what the phony neocons do.
[02:48:30.272 --> 02:48:31.432]  They're not Christians, folks.
[02:48:32.973 --> 02:48:34.493]  The videos are $25.95.
[02:48:34.593 --> 02:48:35.254]  Order three or more.
[02:48:35.274 --> 02:48:35.854]  They drop down to $20.
[02:48:37.342 --> 02:48:38.562]  Order Out of Chaos, the new book.
[02:48:38.602 --> 02:48:39.503]  Over 300 pages.
[02:48:39.703 --> 02:48:40.443]  It's $19.95.
[02:48:40.483 --> 02:48:41.143]  Get a second book.
[02:48:41.363 --> 02:48:42.723]  And for only $12, give us a gift.
[02:48:42.963 --> 02:48:43.544]  My book's only $12.
[02:48:44.464 --> 02:48:45.204]  Ascent into Tyranny.
[02:48:45.304 --> 02:48:46.384]  Call right now.
[02:48:46.464 --> 02:48:47.865]  Don't wait.

[02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:08.774]  Don't wait.
[02:49:08.794 --> 02:49:09.194]  888-253-3139.
[02:49:09.754 --> 02:49:13.517]  You can do so much more if you just support us.
[02:49:14.218 --> 02:49:14.818]  I'm out of time.
[02:49:14.878 --> 02:49:15.779]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:15.819 --> 02:49:16.920]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.

[02:49:19.802 --> 02:49:21.003]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:49:21.163 --> 02:49:22.784]  The globalists are afraid of you.
[02:49:23.104 --> 02:49:24.105]  You've got power.
[02:49:24.125 --> 02:49:25.146]  You've got power.
[02:49:26.118 --> 02:49:31.426]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:49:31.626 --> 02:49:33.709]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:49:33.950 --> 02:49:36.794]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded.
