[00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:09.776]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:11.257]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:12.937]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.577 --> 00:00:17.238]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.758 --> 00:00:21.879]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:29.562]  Hello, my friends listening worldwide.
[00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:34.823]  Africa to Asia to right here in the Western Hemisphere, in the United States.
[00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:43.336]  In Mexico, in Canada, in Chile, from Denmark to Australia, we have listeners.
[00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:48.158]  It is Monday, the 22nd of December, 2003.
[00:00:48.238 --> 00:00:50.219]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:50.739 --> 00:01:00.544]  In the third hour, I have Congressman Ron Paul joining us to talk about a whole plethora of very important issues, including the national draft.
[00:01:01.485 --> 00:01:04.026]  And Rumsfeld says, we're going to need a bigger army.
[00:01:04.086 --> 00:01:05.707]  We're going to need more troops.
[00:01:06.778 --> 00:01:23.934]  And the recruiting is falling way under the numbers they need and they've got all the draft legislation lined up for you and your family and all they need do is provide another terror attack and our journey into pure fascism will be complete.
[00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:27.778]  Nations threat level raised to orange.
[00:01:28.803 --> 00:01:34.106]  Raised to orange, government says attacks possible during the holidays.
[00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:35.527]  And they did this last year.
[00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:40.790]  But if we learn to give our rights up to them, maybe we'll be safe.
[00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:44.452]  The good guys wear black ski masks and are going to save us.
[00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:52.317]  But the report that spurred all of this, just like every other alert, turns out to be fake.
[00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:59.651]  London Times, ABC News, suicide bomber threat turns out to be false, but that's in the back of the newspapers.
[00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:01.491]  They're still announcing the orange alert.
[00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:08.455]  I wanted to go back over terror alerts, manufactured FBI agency, White House scripting hysterics for political effect.
[00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:09.656]  I have dozens of these stories.
[00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:16.199]  The one in front of me is from World Net Daily back in January of this year, almost 12 months ago.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.401]  Nations threat level being raised to orange.
[00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:21.021]  We'll get into that.
[00:02:21.202 --> 00:02:21.682]  Also,
[00:02:22.605 --> 00:02:27.329]  A couple weeks ago, or a week ago, many Arabs skeptical on Saddam's capture.
[00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:37.037]  I wanted to go back to that because now it's coming out that, as usual, just like with Private Lynch, what we're being shown is a fable.
[00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:39.500]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.061]  They've had him a long time.
[00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:42.002]  He's been drugged.
[00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:42.983]  He's been tortured.
[00:02:43.943 --> 00:02:45.665]  Why didn't they just tell the truth about it?
[00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:48.211]  Six Saddam drugged.
[00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:55.013]  That's because he had to be drugged and tortured first, folks, so he wouldn't spout off about who he's business partners with.
[00:02:55.273 --> 00:03:05.014]  Well, we have the congressional reports by Republicans and Democrats, but, you know, it's bad to have the boogeyman saying he's buddies with Bush, just like Bin Laden's buddies with him.
[00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:07.115]  Six Saddam drugged.
[00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:12.336]  Also, Saddam was held by Kurdish forces, drugged, and left for U.S.
[00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:12.856]  troops.
[00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:15.998]  That's AFP, here's City Morning Herald.
[00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:18.640]  We got him, Kurds say they caught Saddam.
[00:03:20.121 --> 00:03:24.884]  That's right, also from ABC News, Saddam held by Kurds, drugged and left for U.S.
[00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:25.184]  troops.
[00:03:25.684 --> 00:03:35.491]  Folks, day one, when I got on the air Monday, after hearing the announcement Sunday and watching it, I said, that guy had been beaten, that guy had been drugged, he'd been in that hole quite a while.
[00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:45.395]  Or he'd been in some hole quite a while, and then Israeli intelligence front Debka came out and actually agreed with me and said, yeah, he's been held for a while.
[00:03:45.415 --> 00:03:49.416]  Reuters reported that the beard was fake, then said it was real.
[00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:53.057]  We're getting lied to here, folks.
[00:03:53.117 --> 00:03:53.977]  That's all I know.
[00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:57.418]  Certainly looks like the real Saddam, though.
[00:03:57.518 --> 00:03:59.038]  But don't you love this broadcast?
[00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:01.199]  You can tune in a week plus before.
[00:04:02.246 --> 00:04:30.537]  Hand and then find out exactly what's going to come out later just because we know how to observe So we got encouraged say and that's ABC News headline also Saddam verdict expected to take five years like Slobo From Serbia, you'll forget all about him before that happens exclusive from Time magazine the US may need bigger army Donald Rumsfeld tells time lots of new countries to invade and
[00:04:31.403 --> 00:04:35.745]  Dollar drops becomes more ominous, that out of Reuters.
[00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:39.966]  Clinton agrees with Bush, backs him up that Saddam is Al Qaeda.
[00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:41.507]  Of course he's a liar, of course he would.
[00:04:42.367 --> 00:04:43.667]  Hillary Clinton agrees with Bush.
[00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:44.308]  They're all buddies.
[00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:47.149]  Folks, I haven't scratched the surface.
[00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:53.131]  There is so much to cover today and Congressman Ron Paul, so please stay with us.
[00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:54.191]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:58.033]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:04:58.333 --> 00:04:58.973]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:05.405]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:09.989]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.552]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.572 --> 00:05:15.914]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:18.496]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:31.731]  Oh my-
[00:06:01.757 --> 00:06:06.483]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:06:06.623 --> 00:06:07.224]  Yes, it's true.
[00:06:07.244 --> 00:06:10.008]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:06:10.128 --> 00:06:14.133]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:06:14.213 --> 00:06:14.793]  You heard it right.
[00:06:14.934 --> 00:06:19.900]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.041]  The list goes on and on.
[00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:25.323]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[00:06:25.423 --> 00:06:27.524]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[00:06:27.725 --> 00:06:28.945]  This is a limited time offer.
[00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:33.308]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[00:06:33.468 --> 00:06:35.289]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.
[00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.471]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.222 --> 00:07:01.803]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.204 --> 00:07:07.928]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:08.188 --> 00:07:13.312]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:13.653 --> 00:07:22.980]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.244]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:32.586]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:07:32.766 --> 00:07:37.568]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:07:37.908 --> 00:07:43.811]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:50.377]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:07:51.418 --> 00:07:52.279]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:52.799]  Big Brother.
[00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:53.540]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.830]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:11.291]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:12.951]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.971 --> 00:08:17.452]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.813 --> 00:08:21.934]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.756 --> 00:08:33.477]  We're all in hot water, folks.
[00:08:36.002 --> 00:08:46.747]  The all-seeing eye of the New World Order is launching its attacks worldwide, carrying out terror events to scare us into submission.
[00:08:47.668 --> 00:09:02.715]  And if we don't cause a realization of this globally, if we don't realize who stands to gain from the terror, and then look at the evidence of who's behind the terror, the caught red-handed smoking gun evidence, we're in even more trouble.
[00:09:04.901 --> 00:09:06.963]  There is so much amazing news today.
[00:09:07.003 --> 00:09:08.024]  We're going to cover it all.
[00:09:08.044 --> 00:09:11.547]  We're going to take calls and cover news for the first two hours.
[00:09:12.047 --> 00:09:16.371]  Then in the third hour, we have Congressman Ron Paul joining us.
[00:09:16.451 --> 00:09:18.252]  Congressman from Texas.
[00:09:20.514 --> 00:09:23.056]  Nation's threat level raised to orange.
[00:09:24.117 --> 00:09:25.778]  The level has been raised.
[00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:29.942]  Government says attacks possible during the holiday.
[00:09:30.974 --> 00:09:31.795]  Washington.
[00:09:32.235 --> 00:09:45.145]  Today, security is being increased at airports, borders, and ports as the nation stands at code orange, the second highest alert level for terrorist threats.
[00:09:46.146 --> 00:09:52.971]  The upgrade, Sunday, from code yellow, or elevated status, followed warnings from the government that Al-Qaeda militants
[00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:57.622]  Maybe plotting attacks on America during the holidays.
[00:09:58.083 --> 00:10:01.166]  The new designation indicates a high risk.
[00:10:01.206 --> 00:10:08.613]  Well, NORTHCOM's at the extraordinary level, and has always been, and according to General Eberhardt, that's martial law.
[00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:10.795]  But again, that's just the LA Times.
[00:10:10.815 --> 00:10:15.319]  Who wants to listen to the General, the head of NORTHCOM, telling you how wonderful all this is?
[00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:18.682]  The information we have indicates that extremists abroad
[00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:32.768]  ...are anticipating near-term attacks that they believe will either rival or exceed the September 11, 2001 attacks, Homeland Security Tom Ridge said in announcing the change.
[00:10:34.809 --> 00:10:39.671]  Now, folks, they backed off putting out these alerts every week, what, about six, eight months ago?
[00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:47.234]  Because a bunch of articles came out, mainstream news, where the White House was ordering false alerts to be issued
[00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.872]  Ordering false alerts to be issued.
[00:10:52.853 --> 00:10:55.535]  But notice how Governor Ridge calls them extremist.
[00:10:56.375 --> 00:11:08.504]  See, that's a word that the Simon Wiesenthal Center or the ADL or the Southern Poverty Law Center or the FBI can call you if you're for land rights or the Second Amendment and not get sued.
[00:11:08.804 --> 00:11:10.085]  It's an interchangeable word.
[00:11:10.225 --> 00:11:10.745]  Extremist.
[00:11:10.765 --> 00:11:11.646]  Well, what's an extremist?
[00:11:12.682 --> 00:11:15.685]  And then they can use it for people where the term doesn't fit.
[00:11:15.705 --> 00:11:17.606]  You should call them terrorists or criminals.
[00:11:17.946 --> 00:11:21.369]  They can use that word there and then change the semantical meaning.
[00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.431]  I just thought I would point that out.
[00:11:23.471 --> 00:11:24.832]  That's happening everywhere.
[00:11:26.113 --> 00:11:27.314]  Oh, that guy's an extremist.
[00:11:27.755 --> 00:11:31.518]  Some of the intelligence information Gathered Ridge said indicates that Osama Bin Laden
[00:11:32.378 --> 00:11:36.120]  Terrorist network is seeking again to use planes as weapons.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:44.143]  They are consistently evaluating procedures to find gaps in our security posture that could be exploited.
[00:11:45.063 --> 00:11:58.489]  He said the threat information comes from multiple credible sources, but officials are unaware of a specific target or means of attack, said a senior law enforcement official who spoke in condition of anonymity.
[00:11:59.835 --> 00:12:05.558]  What's scary is they announced all these over the last year and a half and now have been kind of quiet for a while.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.021]  And we know who's carrying out the terror.
[00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:19.086]  So when the people in the government start telling you brace for attacks, it makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:39.832]  All over the country, to get on a plane, or get on a bus, or down across a bridge, or to get on a ferry, men in black uniforms, usually illegal aliens, and I'm serious, 90% of those at the Boston Airport weren't citizens, and about 40% were illegal aliens, many of them from Syria, Iran, you name it.
[00:12:39.872 --> 00:12:49.999]  But again, we're going to accept all the matricular cards of the illegal aliens and legalize them, Ridge said two weeks ago, but you're going to have a magnifying glass crammed down your throat.
[00:12:51.664 --> 00:12:54.646]  But, uh, what spurred this alert Friday?
[00:12:55.486 --> 00:12:58.628]  ABC News, suicide bomber threat turns out to be false.
[00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:02.691]  London Times, the average person didn't hear about this, though, because it's not in your newspaper.
[00:13:03.351 --> 00:13:10.476]  America suffered a spasm of fear and alarm as two reports of terrorist activity rapidly gained credibility.
[00:13:10.516 --> 00:13:19.982]  The discovery of white powder on the Pennsylvania Avenue pavement outside the White House caused a section of Central Washington to be cordoned off by police who put
[00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:20.715]  Yes, sir.
[00:13:38.226 --> 00:13:39.027]  And it goes on.
[00:13:39.327 --> 00:13:47.572]  In New York, the stock market dipped after an inaccurate report appeared on ABC News website citing an unnamed U.S.
[00:13:47.612 --> 00:13:54.897]  intelligence sources having given a warning of an imminent credible threat to the Manhattan landmark by a woman suicide bomber.
[00:13:55.197 --> 00:13:56.818]  Police rapidly issued a denial.
[00:13:57.018 --> 00:14:05.164]  In an interview yesterday, New York Times head of the commission investigating the September 11th attack said that they could have been averted
[00:14:05.828 --> 00:14:08.990]  Had the FBI, immigration, other officials done their job?
[00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:15.314]  Thomas Keene said investigators were still studying whether senior figures in the Bush administration should share the blame.
[00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:20.998]  He also went on to say that, you know, it wasn't anybody's fault, just that they need more funding.
[00:14:21.018 --> 00:14:24.740]  I mean, this is a guy they appointed, and they call it an independent commission.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:33.086]  It's like when Reno appointed Senator Danforth to investigate Janet Reno, and they called him independent.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.642]  I mean, a two-year-old should be able to figure out that's not independent.
[00:14:38.943 --> 00:14:48.889]  But again, we're talking about a general public that doesn't know what the First Amendment is, that doesn't know how many continents there are, that doesn't know where Iraq is, that doesn't know what the three branches of government are.
[00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.231]  Most people don't know who the Vice President is.
[00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:57.174]  And I'm not being sardonic here, acting elitist.
[00:14:57.255 --> 00:14:59.456]  It scares the daylights out of me.
[00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:04.117]  I thought I'd read back over some other fake terror alerts from the past.
[00:15:04.197 --> 00:15:09.899]  These are posted on PrisonPlanet.com in the Fake Terror and Fabricated Evidence subsection.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.200]  Terror alerts manufactured.
[00:15:12.281 --> 00:15:16.222]  FBI agents say White House scripting hysterics for political effect.
[00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:18.684]  Ordering them to put out false reports.
[00:15:18.704 --> 00:15:19.624]  We're on that daily.
[00:15:20.284 --> 00:15:24.766]  Fake infiltration sources say informant made up story of men who slipped into U.S.
[00:15:24.926 --> 00:15:25.787]  ABC News.
[00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:29.515]  Politics drove decision to raise alert level.
[00:15:29.936 --> 00:15:31.037]  Capitol Hill blew.
[00:15:31.057 --> 00:15:33.339]  White House press secretary admitted that.
[00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:36.081]  Italy frees Pakistani terrorist suspect.
[00:15:36.221 --> 00:15:43.908]  Arrest in a blaze of government back-slapping publicity as a dangerous Al-Qaeda cell.
[00:15:43.968 --> 00:15:45.950]  Turns out there's no evidence against them.
[00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.711]  BBC.
[00:15:47.672 --> 00:15:53.577]  And there's a bunch of reports where they would arrest somebody, say they were a terrorist, then quietly release them and, oh, they're a CIA asset.
[00:15:54.778 --> 00:16:09.009]  That's happened in the Philippines, it's happened in Bali, it's happened in Malaysia, it's happened in Saudi Arabia, it's happened in this country, it's happened in Israel.
[00:16:09.029 --> 00:16:19.718]  They get caught blowing stuff up and then release the people that supposedly did it and it turns out they're CIA, Mossad, it happened in Indonesia, it just keeps happening.
[00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:32.134]  So nation's threat level rising to orange, and these are people who've admitted they put out false reports for political control to scare you, scripting hysterics.
[00:16:33.396 --> 00:16:38.423]  So the government, after fear-mongering with fake reports on Friday, raised the threat level on Sunday.
[00:16:40.319 --> 00:16:42.281]  Very, very serious situation.
[00:16:42.321 --> 00:16:46.284]  And then we get into all this Saddam news, which they're trying to smokescreen.
[00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:48.226]  Sick Saddam drugged.
[00:16:48.747 --> 00:16:50.148]  This is out of the news of Australia.
[00:16:50.188 --> 00:16:53.190]  Startling new photograph of sick-looking Saddam Hussein.
[00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.894]  Suggests he's being drugged or given strong medication by his US captors.
[00:16:57.574 --> 00:17:00.157]  Well, I mean, the guy was obviously drugged when they pulled him out of that hole.
[00:17:00.657 --> 00:17:08.284]  The man who took the photo told The Weekend Australian last night Hussein appeared very sick when he was visited by Iraq's governing council member.
[00:17:09.182 --> 00:17:09.883]  We're good to go.
[00:17:22.193 --> 00:17:34.300]  With pronounced bags under bloodshot eyes and a stricken plaster on the back of his right hand where he has reportedly been receiving intravenous injections.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.982]  Ah, he has the injection ports in him.
[00:17:38.382 --> 00:17:40.043]  Maybe they'll put a heart plug in him.
[00:17:40.583 --> 00:17:41.464]  Better than Harkonnen.
[00:17:42.224 --> 00:17:48.688]  Hussein's daughter has claimed her father must be being drugged by the CIA interrogators for him to submit meekly to questioning.
[00:17:49.221 --> 00:18:01.792]  The photo shows the former president who once lived in a string of palaces is now being kept in a converted bathroom lit by spotlights with his bed right next to a toilet on a tiled shower recess.
[00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:06.997]  Hussein's location is a tightly guarded secret, but the only wall hanging in the room was a U.S.
[00:18:07.037 --> 00:18:10.680]  military map of Baghdad suggesting he was being kept at a U.S.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.122]  base in the capital, probably at the Baghdad airport.
[00:18:13.948 --> 00:18:38.990]  The photo, which is on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, of a sick-looking and unkempt Hussein showed him being visited by Dr. Shalibi, the number two man in the Shah's torture squads, the convicted bank robber wanted by our allies, who fled Iraq in 1958 after Hussein ordered him killed, and is now the Pentagon's favorite to become the next Iraqi president.
[00:18:40.416 --> 00:18:43.900]  Who fled Iraq in 1958 after Hussein ordered him killed?
[00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:44.581]  What?
[00:18:45.723 --> 00:18:55.114]  Saddam Hussein was hired in 1954, this is a congressional report, to be an anti-communist assassin.
[00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:58.278]  Now Saddam was planning to kill him?
[00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:01.433]  Four years later?
[00:19:02.053 --> 00:19:04.034]  Oh, see how evil Saddam is!
[00:19:04.474 --> 00:19:18.843]  That photo, another in which he is talking to Dr. Shalibi in an animated way, caused a stir in Baghdad when they were published on the front page of Al Mutamar, the newspaper of Dr. Shalibi's Iraq National Congress, which said the meeting took place on Monday.
[00:19:21.324 --> 00:19:22.765]  Well, isn't that nice?
[00:19:22.865 --> 00:19:24.426]  Isn't that just precious?
[00:19:24.986 --> 00:19:25.867]  Now, when we get back,
[00:19:26.511 --> 00:19:30.654]  Saddam Hussein held by Kurdish forces drugged and left for U.S.
[00:19:30.694 --> 00:19:31.035]  troops.
[00:19:31.055 --> 00:19:35.738]  I heard the neocons last Friday going, how dare anyone say this?
[00:19:36.099 --> 00:19:38.420]  Our government would never lie or never state something.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.882]  You're a bunch of nutcases.
[00:19:41.243 --> 00:19:43.024]  You're a bunch of crazy saying this.
[00:19:43.604 --> 00:19:50.109]  I guess then ABC News is and Reuters and the Associated Press?
[00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.373]  We'll, uh, go over that.
[00:19:55.288 --> 00:19:59.357]  And so much more as we fight the terrorists.
[00:20:01.388 --> 00:20:06.029]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first-ever half-price package sale at the ARC Institute.

[00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:04.273]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:04.673 --> 00:22:10.095]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:10.575 --> 00:22:11.655]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:22:11.695 --> 00:22:15.737]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:29.621]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:30.188 --> 00:22:35.490]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.

[00:22:47.916 --> 00:22:47.976]  1-800-686-2237.

[00:23:40.623 --> 00:23:43.945]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:13.508]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:13.569 --> 00:24:20.354]  Coming up, your calls on any of the news items we've mentioned, or any particular article you'd like to bring up that we have not covered.
[00:24:20.374 --> 00:24:28.880]  If you disagree with me, you agree with me, you have questions, comments, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:29.881 --> 00:24:32.643]  And here's your chance to get involved, because the phones have been loaded for weeks.
[00:24:32.663 --> 00:24:36.446]  You can't even get in from the start of the show, but there's a few lines open right now.
[00:24:37.646 --> 00:24:41.428]  At 800-259-9231, there's the phone number.
[00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:44.950]  Continuing with the news.
[00:24:46.031 --> 00:24:53.835]  You know, over 70% of Americans believe Saddam worked with Al-Qaeda, despite the fact that they admit he never did.
[00:24:55.996 --> 00:25:01.339]  So, it doesn't matter if everybody finds out the capture was staged, because it's emotional.
[00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:05.921]  The big headlines say it wasn't staged, later they can admit it was staged.
[00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.231]  But the average person won't differentiate.
[00:25:10.411 --> 00:25:13.412]  They're not concerned about hearing different stories every day.
[00:25:15.132 --> 00:25:21.193]  Again, it's like the nightly news is an entertainment program or something.
[00:25:21.213 --> 00:25:23.574]  It's just totally unconscious.
[00:25:24.974 --> 00:25:28.975]  Saddam was held by Kurdish forces, drugged, and left for the U.S.
[00:25:29.015 --> 00:25:33.336]  And I've got AP, AFP, Sunday Morning Herald, ABC, you name it.
[00:25:34.466 --> 00:25:36.427]  Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S.
[00:25:36.787 --> 00:25:48.232]  troops only after he had been taken prisoner by Kurdish forces, drugged and abandoned, ready for American soldiers to recover him, a British Sunday newspaper reported.
[00:25:49.012 --> 00:26:01.737]  Saddam came into the hands of the Kurdish Patriotic Front after being betrayed to the group by a member of the Al-Jabur tribe, whose daughter had been raped by Saddam's son, Uday.
[00:26:02.725 --> 00:26:10.229]  Leading to a blood feud reported the Sunday Express which quoted an unnamed senior British military intelligence officer.
[00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:26.418]  The newspaper said the full story of events leading up to the ousted Iraqi president's capture on December 13th near his hometown of Tikrit in northern Iraq exposes the version peddled by American spin doctors as incomplete.
[00:26:27.883 --> 00:26:30.125]  That's a total lie, folks, if they covered that up.
[00:26:30.666 --> 00:26:41.194]  A former Iraq intelligence officer, whom the Express did not name, told the paper that Saddam was held prisoner by a leader of the Kurdish Patriotic Front, which fought alongside U.S.
[00:26:41.214 --> 00:26:44.997]  forces during the Iraq War until he negotiated a deal.
[00:26:45.057 --> 00:26:48.780]  The deal apparently involved the group gaining political advantage in the region.
[00:26:50.441 --> 00:26:56.046]  Before I go any further, why would they stage the capture knowing it would come out?
[00:26:57.722 --> 00:26:59.704]  Well, they staged the Jessica Lynch thing.
[00:26:59.744 --> 00:27:00.765]  She said it's a fable.
[00:27:01.405 --> 00:27:04.708]  I still have arguments with people on the street saying it was all real.
[00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:10.953]  People still believe they found dozens of chemical and biological weapons plants.
[00:27:10.993 --> 00:27:12.234]  They remember those news reports.
[00:27:12.594 --> 00:27:18.840]  Sean Hannity still saying they found mobile weapons trucks and mass graves.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.181]  Admitted to be totally false.
[00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:23.964]  They're still reporting that Niger sold uranium to Saddam.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.221]  And they know that's not true, but the listeners don't.
[00:27:29.221 --> 00:27:34.163]  And so, they've been caught in all these lies, fake reports, you name it.
[00:27:34.863 --> 00:27:36.843]  They don't care, folks.
[00:27:37.364 --> 00:27:45.786]  They don't care that 20-30% of us are thinkers and know that they're lying, because the general public is buying anything they tell them.
[00:27:47.227 --> 00:27:49.667]  They could come out and say the moon was made of cheese.
[00:27:50.067 --> 00:27:53.788]  People probably don't know where the moon is, so they probably would believe it.
[00:27:53.829 --> 00:27:55.289]  I mean, it's almost that bad.
[00:27:56.753 --> 00:28:03.603]  An unnamed Western intelligence source in the Middle East told the Express, Saddam was not captured as a result of any American or British intelligence.
[00:28:03.964 --> 00:28:06.407]  We knew that someone would eventually take their revenge.
[00:28:06.668 --> 00:28:07.709]  It was a matter of time.
[00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:09.953]  That's a respected British newspaper.
[00:28:10.606 --> 00:28:12.247]  Talking to the intelligence source.
[00:28:12.687 --> 00:28:14.908]  And the Australians have their people telling them this.
[00:28:15.548 --> 00:28:16.608]  Here's ABC News.
[00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:20.490]  Saddam held by Kurds, drugged, and left for U.S.
[00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:20.850]  troops.
[00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:22.791]  Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S.
[00:28:22.811 --> 00:28:31.154]  troops only after he had been taken prisoner by Kurdish forces, drugged and abandoned, ready for American soldiers to recover him, a British newspaper has reported.
[00:28:32.394 --> 00:28:36.416]  And I love this article calling it a tabloid, but I have a bunch of other papers reporting it.
[00:28:37.896 --> 00:28:48.364]  Why do we have the colonel who supposedly captured Saddam sitting there on video, we have this from CNN at PrisonPlanet.com, saying, now here's the story.
[00:28:48.785 --> 00:28:49.625]  We found him.
[00:28:49.966 --> 00:28:51.307]  We found him in that hole.
[00:28:51.847 --> 00:28:53.348]  That's the official story.
[00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:54.850]  Keep it there.
[00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:58.813]  Don't tell anybody anything else about what you've seen.
[00:29:01.255 --> 00:29:01.935]  Think about that.
[00:29:01.995 --> 00:29:05.238]  We have the colonel wandering around
[00:29:06.798 --> 00:29:09.259]  Colonel Hinckley sang all this.
[00:29:09.299 --> 00:29:18.702]  The same guy that named Operation Red Dawn and calls the Iraqi insurgents Wolverines from the movie Red Dawn.
[00:29:18.763 --> 00:29:22.164]  So our troops have taken on the mantle of the Soviet occupying force.
[00:29:22.804 --> 00:29:24.505]  There's been some news stories about that.
[00:29:24.545 --> 00:29:24.985]  Amazing.
[00:29:25.945 --> 00:29:32.388]  We'll get back into more of this news and your calls.
[00:29:32.428 --> 00:29:34.248]  There is so much of it and it's so important.
[00:29:34.668 --> 00:29:35.709]  What do you think about this?
[00:29:37.227 --> 00:29:38.188]  1-800-259-9231 and www.infowars.com.
[00:29:38.228 --> 00:29:41.630]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:44.972]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.502 --> 00:30:04.326]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:30:04.446 --> 00:30:05.267]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:30:05.427 --> 00:30:08.712]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:30:08.912 --> 00:30:14.580]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.744]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:30:17.984 --> 00:30:22.269]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.352]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[00:30:24.492 --> 00:30:31.561]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:30:31.741 --> 00:30:34.204]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:30:34.504 --> 00:30:38.828]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[00:30:39.108 --> 00:30:40.870]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.052]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[00:30:43.232 --> 00:30:48.456]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since, and today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[00:30:48.636 --> 00:30:49.157]  Side effects?
[00:30:49.357 --> 00:30:51.599]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:53.040]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:53.280]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.101]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[00:30:54.121 --> 00:30:55.022]  It worked for me.
[00:31:01.447 --> 00:31:02.548]  Oh my!
[00:31:02.648 --> 00:31:07.351]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:31:07.492 --> 00:31:08.112]  Yes, it's true.
[00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:10.894]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:31:11.014 --> 00:31:15.017]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:31:15.077 --> 00:31:15.677]  You heard it right.
[00:31:15.818 --> 00:31:20.801]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:31:20.881 --> 00:31:21.902]  The list goes on and on.
[00:31:22.162 --> 00:31:26.205]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[00:31:26.306 --> 00:31:28.427]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[00:31:28.607 --> 00:31:29.828]  This is a limited time offer.
[00:31:29.908 --> 00:31:34.192]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[00:31:34.352 --> 00:31:36.174]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.
[00:31:39.096 --> 00:31:43.279]  To participate in this limited time offer and have your drugs prescribed over the phone for free, you need to call 1-800-615-7094 now.
[00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:46.841]  That's 1-800-615-7094 for drugs like Phentermine, Ambien, Fioriset, Sama, Ultram, Viagra, and many more.
[00:31:46.861 --> 00:31:48.382]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[00:31:48.402 --> 00:31:49.343]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[00:32:01.107 --> 00:32:02.088]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:32:02.168 --> 00:32:06.952]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:32:07.132 --> 00:32:14.939]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:20.564]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:32:20.784 --> 00:32:27.750]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:33.371]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:32:33.631 --> 00:32:38.373]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:32:38.713 --> 00:32:46.314]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:32:46.655 --> 00:32:52.896]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:32:53.216 --> 00:32:54.336]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:57.065 --> 00:32:57.368]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:33:16.076 --> 00:33:23.461]  Alright folks, coming up the third hour, Congressman Ron Paul in the next hour and 27 minutes until the Congressman joins us.
[00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:26.143]  We're going to go over news and take your calls.
[00:33:26.163 --> 00:33:34.048]  We're about to go to Wesley and Mike and Manuel and Garrett and Brandon and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:34.889 --> 00:33:37.551]  Let me just run through some of the other news that's coming up.
[00:33:38.191 --> 00:33:41.574]  But again, Saddam held by Kurds, drugged and left for U.S.
[00:33:41.634 --> 00:33:41.954]  troops.
[00:33:41.994 --> 00:33:43.295]  That's British intelligence.
[00:33:44.074 --> 00:33:50.198]  And Australians are now saying that and a bunch of other people in government are saying it was a completely staged event.
[00:33:52.059 --> 00:34:03.307]  And now a reporter for the Weekend Australian who got in to take photos of Saddam, got photos of injection ports, IV ports on his arm.
[00:34:03.927 --> 00:34:05.928]  He looks totally drugged out and beaten.
[00:34:05.948 --> 00:34:08.710]  They're like, good, beat him!
[00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:10.471]  That guy tortured people!
[00:34:10.531 --> 00:34:11.472]  Torture him!
[00:34:12.122 --> 00:34:12.842]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:34:13.423 --> 00:34:15.203]  Joseph Mengel is bad when he tortures.
[00:34:15.263 --> 00:34:16.584]  Saddam's bad when he tortures.
[00:34:16.644 --> 00:34:25.927]  But when Mr. Chalibi, the tortured master of Iran, comes in for visits with Saddam, it's good.
[00:34:26.508 --> 00:34:28.808]  Yes, you're learning double-think out there.
[00:34:29.569 --> 00:34:30.229]  Very, very well.
[00:34:30.249 --> 00:34:35.091]  When Governor Ridge has raised the terror alert, give up all your rights, or the terrorists will get you.
[00:34:36.751 --> 00:34:38.052]  Coming up, Saddam verdict.
[00:34:38.292 --> 00:34:40.773]  Expected to take five years, so you all forget about it.
[00:34:41.656 --> 00:34:42.817]  Exclusive, the U.S.
[00:34:42.897 --> 00:34:49.120]  may need a bigger army, Donald Rumsfeld tells Time Magazine, getting ready for the draft.
[00:34:50.381 --> 00:35:07.011]  By the way, back to Saddam, after two or three years of torture and drugging, getting him ready for trial, which is legal in this country by the way, the Supreme Court's rule, they can grab you, not charge you, and forcibly drug you in solitary confinement for over six years, in the Dr. Charles T. Sell case up in St.
[00:35:07.051 --> 00:35:07.351]  Louis,
[00:35:08.271 --> 00:35:10.372]  But, hmm, what's going to happen here?
[00:35:10.892 --> 00:35:15.913]  Oh, he'll be a good boy by the time he's ready to get up there and testify.
[00:35:16.113 --> 00:35:22.115]  He'll look like our troops who got shot down over Vietnam, who would blink in Morse code, torture, torture.
[00:35:22.855 --> 00:35:25.476]  Of course the North Vietnamese are good people.
[00:35:26.116 --> 00:35:27.276]  They're just doing their job.
[00:35:27.336 --> 00:35:28.977]  Torture's an American value.
[00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:35.652]  Of course, I'm being sickeningly sarcastic, but it was wrong when our troops got tortured.
[00:35:35.732 --> 00:35:38.174]  It's wrong to torture other people.
[00:35:39.214 --> 00:35:44.997]  But I know in this new sick culture, where 50 million dead babies isn't enough for you, maybe it's good.
[00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:49.579]  Rumsfeld wants the draft for you and your family.
[00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:55.062]  A dollar's drop becomes more ominous as it plunges even further downward.
[00:35:55.757 --> 00:36:01.419]  The average American still has no idea what this means for all of us, because they're telling us the economy is wonderful.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.300]  Bill Clinton rides the rescue.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.202]  I remember he agreed with Bush about the Iraq invasion.
[00:36:09.362 --> 00:36:10.323]  Shocking people.
[00:36:11.623 --> 00:36:14.064]  So did Hillary, why she was all for it.
[00:36:15.745 --> 00:36:19.406]  And Bill Clinton has defended Bush on making documents secret.
[00:36:19.426 --> 00:36:23.688]  Well yeah, George Bush is protecting Bill Clinton, blocking Dan Burton's committee.
[00:36:24.716 --> 00:36:35.061]  But the Clinton view on Iraq-Al Qaeda ties, and it says, are Al Qaeda's links to Saddam Hussein-Iraq just a fantasy of the Bush administration?
[00:36:35.521 --> 00:36:36.141]  Hardly.
[00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:44.865]  The Clinton administration also warned the American public about those ties and defended its response to Al Qaeda terror by citing an Iraq connection.
[00:36:45.986 --> 00:36:49.167]  And now Bill Clinton is out defending Bush and what he did.
[00:36:49.767 --> 00:36:51.088]  This is the same man that said
[00:36:51.864 --> 00:36:53.906]  I did not have sex with that woman.
[00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:58.108]  Monica Lewinsky, and how dare any of you say it!
[00:36:58.989 --> 00:37:01.531]  Just like, Saddam's got weapons of mass destruction.
[00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:03.472]  He, Niger is solding uranium.
[00:37:03.492 --> 00:37:04.753]  There's mass graves!
[00:37:04.853 --> 00:37:05.894]  It's lies!
[00:37:07.194 --> 00:37:08.896]  Well, you're not for Saddam, are you?
[00:37:08.956 --> 00:37:10.697]  No, I'm not for Bush's business partner.
[00:37:10.757 --> 00:37:11.357]  No, I'm not.
[00:37:12.818 --> 00:37:17.721]  Also, USA Today, tiny transmitters give retailers, privacy advocates, goosebumps.
[00:37:18.202 --> 00:37:21.364]  And we have this industry diagram of how it works.
[00:37:22.103 --> 00:37:24.944]  Shows the factory where the RFID goes in.
[00:37:25.484 --> 00:37:27.105]  Shows the truck taking it to the store.
[00:37:27.125 --> 00:37:29.085]  Shows you leaving your house with it.
[00:37:29.125 --> 00:37:30.606]  It's a cartoon image of it.
[00:37:30.986 --> 00:37:35.207]  Driving home, then it leaving, going in your trash can to the landfill.
[00:37:36.648 --> 00:37:39.388]  Tracking everything you do.
[00:37:39.408 --> 00:37:41.009]  Well, that sounds like a free country.
[00:37:42.939 --> 00:37:45.480]  Also, Israel planning Iran attack.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.680]  Oh, that should cause some fireworks.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.440]  Attack their nuclear reactors.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.661]  Police call for remote button to stop all your cars.
[00:37:52.881 --> 00:37:55.281]  That's already in there, now they're just announcing it.
[00:37:56.241 --> 00:38:00.602]  Parents told shouting at youth football matches is child abuse.
[00:38:00.982 --> 00:38:07.883]  Sunday Herald, it says children will be taken if parents shout at soccer games.
[00:38:09.144 --> 00:38:10.704]  I have the official Sunday Herald here.
[00:38:11.813 --> 00:38:15.176]  And yelling at your child will be cause for them being taken.
[00:38:15.776 --> 00:38:22.801]  Does it matter if the western world is five times more likely, that is, governments in the western world, to abuse children than anyone else?
[00:38:23.622 --> 00:38:30.166]  Does it matter if pedophiles and sickos and abusers and warehousers of children get into this business?
[00:38:30.647 --> 00:38:31.427]  It doesn't matter.
[00:38:31.527 --> 00:38:35.170]  No one's going to investigate them, and they're going to take your children.
[00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:43.902]  So now they don't just arrest you in England for stabbing someone who's raping your wife in your house at 2 a.m., which they do.
[00:38:44.362 --> 00:38:45.923]  They'll give you between 5 and life.
[00:38:46.563 --> 00:38:47.783]  There's cases every week of this.
[00:38:48.244 --> 00:38:50.304]  Now if you shout at your child.
[00:38:51.265 --> 00:38:55.567]  Now if you shout at a soccer game, it's hateful.
[00:38:56.947 --> 00:38:57.707]  Wait till we get to that.
[00:38:57.767 --> 00:39:01.489]  Also, China thanks Bush for Taiwan stance.
[00:39:02.276 --> 00:39:06.778]  He says, thank you for what you've done and masses troops and probably says they may invade.
[00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:09.839]  Buffett saw terror threat.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.660]  We'll get into that.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.582]  Illinois is to seek exemption to buy drugs from Canada.
[00:39:17.803 --> 00:39:21.004]  And Al Gord, son, arrested for pot possession.
[00:39:21.524 --> 00:39:29.348]  I'm for drug decriminalization, but when Rush Limbaugh's on Oxycontin and he says arrest anybody on drugs, then I want him in prison.
[00:39:30.507 --> 00:39:37.452]  And when Al Gore has passed a lot of money for drug law enforcement programs, let's put his son in prison.
[00:39:38.733 --> 00:39:39.494]  You hypocrite.
[00:39:40.394 --> 00:39:43.516]  That's just some of what is coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:39:43.957 --> 00:39:45.778]  Let's go to the calls as promised, though.
[00:39:45.858 --> 00:39:46.819]  Let's go to them quickly.
[00:39:47.539 --> 00:39:48.920]  Bam, bam, bam.
[00:39:49.341 --> 00:39:51.042]  Wesley in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[00:39:51.082 --> 00:39:51.542]  Go ahead.
[00:39:52.723 --> 00:39:54.604]  Good morning, Alex, or good afternoon, Alex.
[00:39:54.644 --> 00:39:55.205]  How are you today?
[00:39:55.425 --> 00:39:55.865]  I'm fine.
[00:39:57.789 --> 00:40:04.412]  Before I talk about the upcoming terrorist attack, I just want to make a brief comment about Joseph Biden.
[00:40:05.212 --> 00:40:23.079]  The day after the alleged capture of Saddam, they did a live interview with Joe, and I'm sitting here with my wife watching it, and I was so taken aback and taken by surprise that I can't remember the network.
[00:40:23.599 --> 00:40:26.060]  I do know, however, that it was the only time that I saw
[00:40:28.486 --> 00:40:37.231]  During the interview, they were talking to him about the upcoming presidential race, and he said that he would be satisfied to have George Bush serve a second term.
[00:40:38.092 --> 00:40:47.357]  And I turned around and looked at my wife and I said... Yeah, you have one of the leading Democrats in the Senate, worshipping Bush, and I did read his comments, I didn't see it.
[00:40:48.318 --> 00:40:50.119]  You have Hillary worshipping him.
[00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:55.062]  This is totally staged, and it shows you the system we're going into.
[00:40:56.155 --> 00:40:57.836]  It's absolute proof.
[00:40:57.896 --> 00:41:06.819]  I mean, Hagel would be absolutely just enthralled with how we have managed to raise his dialectic to an art form.
[00:41:06.879 --> 00:41:25.486]  But getting back to this business with this upcoming attack, gosh, you know, I've never done this before, but I really have such a strong feeling about this that I really honestly believe that because of the timing of the capture of Saddam, that
[00:41:25.939 --> 00:41:30.221]  The time is ripe for an attack on this country again.
[00:41:30.281 --> 00:41:31.341]  Well, let me just say this.
[00:41:31.721 --> 00:41:33.302]  They would have already carried out attacks.
[00:41:33.402 --> 00:41:35.363]  The globalists would have already released smallpox.
[00:41:35.783 --> 00:41:36.583]  That was clear.
[00:41:37.063 --> 00:41:52.890]  But because the police and firefighters and medical workers refused to take the shots to be the frontline force injectors of us, the public, we have all the articles about they're going to round people up, put them in the sports stadiums, force inject them, trying to get the volunteers, then trying to pay people.
[00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.551]  Everybody, I mean everybody, refused.
[00:41:56.092 --> 00:41:57.334]  So that plan fell apart.
[00:41:57.715 --> 00:42:05.511]  So now they've moved to bombing British embassies and British banks and bombing our troops and bombing others to keep the fear going.
[00:42:06.343 --> 00:42:10.487]  But certainly, look, I'm glad they didn't just capture Saddam.
[00:42:10.747 --> 00:42:15.010]  That's the type of stunt they'll pull other than carrying out more terror.
[00:42:15.431 --> 00:42:18.213]  I'd rather Bush pull stunts and not, you know, kill people.
[00:42:18.994 --> 00:42:22.076]  And again, Bush isn't doing anything, he's a puppet, but Bush is the titular head.
[00:42:22.396 --> 00:42:35.247]  I'd rather that military-industrial complex represented by Bush do stuff like that and just pull basic stunts or, you know, announce a fake weapons of mass destruction find to keep their control going than the next big event.
[00:42:36.371 --> 00:42:38.812]  Well, they've issued the warning.
[00:42:39.373 --> 00:42:43.195]  They've told us the type of weapon that will be used in the attack.
[00:42:44.255 --> 00:43:00.264]  And I'm not in the business of doing this kind of stuff, but I have a strong feeling that somewhere between now and the day, including the day that they play the Super Bowl, between then and now, I expect an attack with an airplane here in the continental United States.
[00:43:01.084 --> 00:43:05.107]  Well, there is that missing jet, remember, that got stolen in Africa?
[00:43:05.588 --> 00:43:06.849]  The 747, right?
[00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.369]  Yeah.
[00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:12.233]  So, I mean, I think that the time is ripe.
[00:43:12.293 --> 00:43:15.575]  I mean, everybody has got Bishop on a pedestal.
[00:43:16.536 --> 00:43:22.761]  He's shown that he's stood up to the tough guy, and he captured him, and he proved that he was the better man.
[00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:29.064]  And what a better time to reinforce this with another attack against a domestic target.
[00:43:29.264 --> 00:43:32.306]  Well, that's the motive, that's the past history, that's the evidence.
[00:43:32.346 --> 00:43:33.347]  So thanks for the call, Wesley.
[00:43:33.387 --> 00:43:33.707]  Thank you.
[00:43:34.087 --> 00:43:35.528]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[00:43:35.588 --> 00:43:36.368]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:43:36.408 --> 00:43:36.829]  Go ahead.
[00:43:38.049 --> 00:43:38.650]  Alex, how you doing?
[00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:39.290]  Fine, sir.
[00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.512]  Alex, I just want to say my father just traveled abroad over to Spain.
[00:43:43.252 --> 00:43:45.374]  And the Spanish newspaper is over there.
[00:43:46.074 --> 00:43:52.538]  He said in English, if it's translated, it says the American media is brainwashing Americans to accept
[00:43:53.689 --> 00:44:01.919]  The Global Government, and it's just amazing how another country other than the United States can view something this truth, but the American people would buy anything that's put in the newspapers.
[00:44:02.908 --> 00:44:05.670]  It's pretty obvious.
[00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:09.732]  The British environment minister went public and said the government did 9-11.
[00:44:09.812 --> 00:44:13.914]  The German technology minister went public, has a best-selling book about it.
[00:44:14.795 --> 00:44:16.296]  Everybody's talking about it.
[00:44:16.976 --> 00:44:20.898]  But again, domestically, everybody's talking about all the fake news reports.
[00:44:20.918 --> 00:44:25.641]  But the average American is so dumbed down, they have no idea.
[00:44:25.661 --> 00:44:26.622]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:44:26.682 --> 00:44:27.522]  They're very dumbed down.
[00:44:27.562 --> 00:44:29.663]  I want to ask you a question.
[00:44:29.883 --> 00:44:30.624]  This terror alert,
[00:44:31.244 --> 00:44:34.347]  Uh, that's been raised now, what is it, it's a high level now?
[00:44:34.647 --> 00:44:36.428]  Yeah, it's next to the highest, orange.
[00:44:36.448 --> 00:44:50.799]  Under a red alert, according to Sid Casperson of FEMA up in New Jersey, you will not be allowed to leave your home, you will be considered enemy combatants if you leave your home, and you will have virtually all your constitutional rights stripped from you.
[00:44:50.819 --> 00:44:54.302]  Now Alex, what's the reason for raising this terror level?
[00:44:55.552 --> 00:44:58.674]  Well, the news of the fake Saddam capture started coming out.
[00:44:58.774 --> 00:45:00.255]  News of Halliburton scamming.
[00:45:00.635 --> 00:45:03.317]  News of 9-11 culpability started coming out.
[00:45:03.657 --> 00:45:04.758]  And they like to scare you.
[00:45:04.778 --> 00:45:05.838]  They did this last Christmas.
[00:45:05.858 --> 00:45:09.441]  They like everybody to be afraid and to see them as our saviors.
[00:45:09.461 --> 00:45:18.206]  So while we're all home for Christmas, on the holidays, we can watch Blockhead Ridge up there telling us how much he loves us.
[00:45:19.767 --> 00:45:20.467]  Unbelievable, Alex.
[00:45:20.567 --> 00:45:22.849]  Well, hopefully we could, you know,
[00:45:23.587 --> 00:45:32.549]  Like you said, Alex, through your videos, I tell anybody out there, I've got five of your videos, and anybody who hasn't seen them needs to get them, because they're a wonderful piece of information.
[00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:35.850]  I've had churches brought up to my local church.
[00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:40.772]  I had another church view three of them, and a lot of the people in there are just, they want questions.
[00:45:40.792 --> 00:45:42.312]  They have questions, they want answers.
[00:45:42.432 --> 00:45:44.533]  I've given information about your website.
[00:45:45.333 --> 00:45:50.034]  It's just a wonderful thing, is knowledge and educating the American people into knowing what the truth is.
[00:45:51.295 --> 00:45:51.855]  Thank you, Mike.
[00:45:51.895 --> 00:45:52.455]  Keep it up.
[00:45:53.314 --> 00:46:01.116]  And I don't want to go on too long about this, but what I do is very dangerous.
[00:46:02.136 --> 00:46:03.436]  I'm a big fish in this fight.
[00:46:04.657 --> 00:46:14.799]  But there are tens of thousands of people who are now prominently fighting the New World Order, like Ron Paul and others, and many other talk show hosts and authors and folks that run websites.
[00:46:15.717 --> 00:46:25.107]  A few years ago, the Globalist, I believe from the evidence, had a provocateur go into Bohemian Grove and do a bunch of bad stuff and then get arrested and, you know, say my name.
[00:46:25.968 --> 00:46:37.161]  I got a report that a guy went into a big hardware store last night here in Austin, pulled his shirt off with a huge swastika on it and began saying, I work for Alex Jones, I work for Alex Jones.
[00:46:38.101 --> 00:46:47.666]  Uh, we have had, uh, we've been, um, at a pro-gun rally and had the, the swastika business happen before and we found out they were, uh, federal informants doing it.
[00:46:48.987 --> 00:46:51.528]  But it, it's, it's really comical.
[00:46:51.548 --> 00:46:54.069]  Uh, I mean, it's not gonna work for them.
[00:46:54.170 --> 00:47:06.436]  I, I, I don't know what type of, uh, thing they're trying to prepare for me, but I, I have a bad feeling and, uh, uh, you know, my family and in this country is worth whatever the cost is.
[00:47:07.661 --> 00:47:12.882]  But, you know, we try to go out and build a veteran a new home.
[00:47:13.302 --> 00:47:15.283]  He died, by the way, earlier this year.
[00:47:15.703 --> 00:47:16.503]  Joe Campana.
[00:47:17.283 --> 00:47:18.404]  World War II vet.
[00:47:20.044 --> 00:47:20.944]  Full disability.
[00:47:20.984 --> 00:47:22.465]  They weren't giving him a disability.
[00:47:22.505 --> 00:47:23.945]  He lived in a little shack.
[00:47:24.965 --> 00:47:26.566]  Didn't even ask the government for anything.
[00:47:26.606 --> 00:47:28.186]  And we went out there, built him a new home.
[00:47:28.706 --> 00:47:29.486]  Austinites did.
[00:47:29.546 --> 00:47:31.307]  There's news articles on that on the website.
[00:47:32.747 --> 00:47:35.448]  Just type in Austinites build veteran new home into a search engine.
[00:47:35.468 --> 00:47:36.268]  Stories will pop up.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.441]  And that was about five years ago.
[00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:52.030]  And even for that, even with that event, we had police coming on the grounds, trying to start fights, trying to talk about violence, trying to frame us for something, just for trying to build a new home.
[00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:56.413]  We had the Fortune 500 demonstration three years ago, and I have this on video.
[00:47:57.375 --> 00:48:00.677]  Then they had cops in anarchist outfits trying to start fights.
[00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:08.262]  I exposed them as police and stopped them before they got the news cameras to film them doing some violence as a pretext to attack all of us.
[00:48:08.282 --> 00:48:13.885]  So we've seen that in Seattle and Miami and everywhere else.
[00:48:14.246 --> 00:48:15.186]  They just keep doing it.
[00:48:15.266 --> 00:48:16.367]  I mean, we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:48:18.188 --> 00:48:22.391]  We got a government, local police, national police, all of them,
[00:48:23.352 --> 00:48:26.174]  That is at the top and many of the departments in between.
[00:48:26.715 --> 00:48:33.579]  Framing people, planting evidence, DNA, running murder for hire, dealing drugs, running whores.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.741]  It's sick, folks.
[00:48:36.941 --> 00:48:39.463]  I mean, we really are living in a corrupt, evil country.
[00:48:39.603 --> 00:48:42.765]  And we've got so many naive people that don't even know it.
[00:48:42.785 --> 00:48:44.467]  But there's more of us than there are of them.
[00:48:44.487 --> 00:48:46.888]  And I don't know about you, but I'm not going along with it.
[00:48:46.928 --> 00:48:47.849]  I'm going to speak out.
[00:48:48.529 --> 00:48:49.510]  I'm going to expose it.
[00:48:50.417 --> 00:48:51.417]  I'm going to resist it.
[00:48:52.358 --> 00:48:54.498]  I'm going to get in these people's faces.
[00:48:55.818 --> 00:48:58.319]  And I'm going to stand up for this country and humanity.
[00:48:59.779 --> 00:49:02.380]  I'm not going to... I mean, these people are so evil, folks.
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:05.220]  The globalists have been caught kidnapping children.
[00:49:05.741 --> 00:49:06.521]  Mainstream news.
[00:49:06.621 --> 00:49:09.922]  The globalists have been caught putting cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[00:49:10.462 --> 00:49:16.103]  The globalists have been caught engaging in every form of wickedness imaginable, and then some.
[00:49:17.355 --> 00:49:26.500]  I mean, my mind has never thought of the things that they get caught doing and suddenly, you know, I'm being bathed in this wickedness just having to research it.
[00:49:28.682 --> 00:49:29.382]  It's stunning.
[00:49:30.102 --> 00:49:38.227]  And if your humanity doesn't boil with a fire to resist this, something's wrong with you, folks.
[00:49:39.908 --> 00:49:42.790]  Just the level of pure evil
[00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:50.796]  And then you've got all these useful idiots that don't ask questions, that empower the system, that give it energy, and give it power, and give it control.
[00:49:51.537 --> 00:49:53.098]  Stop going along with it!
[00:49:53.519 --> 00:49:54.539]  Face the evil!
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:56.701]  Face how bad things have gotten!
[00:49:58.082 --> 00:49:59.343]  And be part of history!
[00:50:01.585 --> 00:50:04.428]  Love your family, love your children, love your country.
[00:50:04.548 --> 00:50:05.909]  Stand against evil!
[00:50:07.105 --> 00:50:19.872]  Because if you cower in fear, you only empower the bullies, the tyrants, the corpulent parasites that are the new world order.
[00:50:21.233 --> 00:50:31.038]  Please, your humanity, your guts, your bones, your very soul should be icy cold with the horror of what's happening.
[00:50:32.038 --> 00:50:33.379]  Fight or flight, folks.
[00:50:33.519 --> 00:50:34.560]  I choose to fight.
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.381]  Fighting is always
[00:50:37.196 --> 00:50:41.159]  The best defense when you're cornered and we are cornered.
[00:50:42.079 --> 00:50:43.260]  We are cornered.
[00:50:44.301 --> 00:50:45.522]  We are cornered.
[00:50:47.143 --> 00:50:57.289]  So face your fears and realize that it's better to face the bully than to get down in the dust on your knees.
[00:50:57.789 --> 00:50:59.871]  We'll be back with more calls and more news.
[00:51:01.488 --> 00:51:02.068]  You've heard of it.
[00:51:02.149 --> 00:51:03.029]  You've searched for it.
[00:51:03.189 --> 00:51:03.910]  We have it.

[00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:08.357]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:53:08.637 --> 00:53:13.382]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:53:13.582 --> 00:53:19.248]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:53:19.468 --> 00:53:23.992]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:53:24.212 --> 00:53:31.378]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:53:31.398 --> 00:53:32.178]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:53:32.218 --> 00:53:35.941]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:53:36.101 --> 00:53:38.623]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:53:38.824 --> 00:53:45.549]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:54:16.282 --> 00:54:26.487]  We're about to go back to Manuel and Garrett and Brandon and John and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:54:28.768 --> 00:54:33.851]  And there's just tons of amazing news exposing the globalist criminality that's coming up.
[00:54:33.891 --> 00:54:40.414]  We'll get back into the fake Saddam capture, the staged event, as the evidence now streams out from government sources.
[00:54:41.243 --> 00:54:44.485]  We'll also get more into the terror alert being raised and what that means.
[00:54:44.525 --> 00:54:51.791]  Before I go back to your calls, I have made ten films, and these are my lasting legacy.
[00:54:52.911 --> 00:54:56.114]  Work that will go on long after I'm gone.
[00:54:57.435 --> 00:54:59.756]  And it hurts the New World Order greatly.
[00:54:59.837 --> 00:55:01.598]  It damages the Globalist.
[00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:08.523]  Every time you get my videos, every time you make a copy, every time you give it to a talk show host or a county commissioner,
[00:55:09.537 --> 00:55:23.712]  Every time you give the videos to your pastor or your rabbi, every time you give the films to your neighbor, get Matrix of Evil, my new film, with Ron Paul and Cynthia McKinney and Colonel Greg Roberts and Frank Morales and myself.

[00:55:32.202 --> 00:55:38.604]  FEMA and Kansas City saying that all Founding Fathers are terrorists, all Christians are terrorists, and enemies of the federal government.
[00:55:38.824 --> 00:55:41.585]  Then we have their training manuals that get even worse.
[00:55:42.245 --> 00:55:48.447]  Not just the official training manuals, but video shot by a firefighter of them saying this to a classroom.
[00:55:49.267 --> 00:55:52.668]  Three minutes of that film, and it's all just as horrible, folks.
[00:55:53.388 --> 00:55:55.829]  It's waking people up because it is so evil.
[00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:57.269]  Yes, it's evil.
[00:55:58.112 --> 00:55:58.352]  Evil!
[00:55:58.392 --> 00:55:59.954]  We must expose the evil!
[00:56:00.234 --> 00:56:02.736]  We must lift up the rock and expose the scorpion!
[00:56:03.556 --> 00:56:04.937]  Get 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:56:04.978 --> 00:56:05.978]  Get Masters of Terror.
[00:56:06.319 --> 00:56:08.280]  Get Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.121]  Don't wait!
[00:56:09.941 --> 00:56:11.242]  All our police aren't bad.
[00:56:11.643 --> 00:56:12.924]  All our FBI aren't bad.
[00:56:13.364 --> 00:56:15.386]  But more and more of them are criminals.
[00:56:15.486 --> 00:56:19.649]  Or they're afraid and going along with the corruption because they know how criminal it is.
[00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:24.913]  You need to get the videos now and wake the sheep up, folks.
[00:56:24.973 --> 00:56:26.254]  The videos are working.
[00:56:26.274 --> 00:56:27.295]  They're waking people up.
[00:56:28.163 --> 00:56:30.825]  A toll-free number to order the films, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:30.865 --> 00:56:31.466]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:56:31.546 --> 00:56:38.170]  Or just write to me, I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:56:38.371 --> 00:56:39.111]  And the videos are $25.95 apiece.
[00:56:57.006 --> 00:56:59.388]  And they're $20 when you order three or more of the films.
[00:56:59.428 --> 00:57:01.170]  We also have books and other great items.
[00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:03.291]  So go to the websites as well.
[00:57:04.032 --> 00:57:07.735]  Let's go ahead and talk to Manuel in Pennsylvania.
[00:57:08.055 --> 00:57:09.216]  Manuel, you're on the air.
[00:57:09.897 --> 00:57:11.258]  Well, it looks like they're turning up the heat.
[00:57:11.638 --> 00:57:15.902]  And whether there's a terrorist attack or not, you see the acclamation going on on TV.
[00:57:15.922 --> 00:57:18.784]  You turn on your TV, it's flu shots, flu shots, flu shots.
[00:57:19.565 --> 00:57:23.368]  The thumb scanning module, they keep flashing that on the TV, so they're pushing their biometrics.
[00:57:23.708 --> 00:57:24.889]  So they're playing on the hysteria.
[00:57:25.365 --> 00:57:26.906]  All we gotta do is turn the tables on them.
[00:57:27.406 --> 00:57:31.467]  We've had your, uh, Masses of Terror here on the local access channel before.
[00:57:31.988 --> 00:57:35.629]  We'll just air, uh, Police Day 3 now again, and I'm going to New York, I'll do the same thing up there.
[00:57:35.649 --> 00:57:37.030]  That's all we need to do.
[00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:39.111]  Because we can see what they're doing, but it's transparent.
[00:57:39.491 --> 00:57:42.272]  It's not gonna- Yeah, I watched a little TV this weekend, and it was.
[00:57:42.312 --> 00:57:52.336]  The terrorists are gonna get you, biometrics are good, cashless society, torture's good, world government's good, give your rights up, men in black ski masks are good.
[00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:54.997]  Look, oh, and also about the torture.
[00:57:55.455 --> 00:57:59.277]  There's another shortwave host, and I respect him, because he has open lines, he don't censor the calls.
[00:57:59.818 --> 00:58:01.679]  He was asking, do you think torture is good?
[00:58:02.119 --> 00:58:02.739]  Can we do it?
[00:58:02.799 --> 00:58:07.502]  Say, if 100 troops were going to die, we knew the 100 troops were going to die, the only reason to save them was the torture sit down.
[00:58:08.222 --> 00:58:12.165]  All of his callers, I think basically all of them, no, absolutely no torture.
[00:58:12.985 --> 00:58:16.767]  And these are people that on other points, they're your consummate neocons and still.
[00:58:17.288 --> 00:58:18.328]  It's not working.
[00:58:18.848 --> 00:58:19.729]  It's not working at all.
[00:58:20.982 --> 00:58:26.624]  Well, if you say torture Saddam, then our troops got what they deserved when the Vietnamese tortured them.
[00:58:26.804 --> 00:58:27.705]  Then they do it over here.
[00:58:28.145 --> 00:58:33.427]  Then they do it over here and we can't claim that we're civilized people living under a rule of law with ethics if that's what we're going to go around doing.
[00:58:35.728 --> 00:58:36.828]  Great points, Manuel.
[00:58:36.848 --> 00:58:37.348]  Are you done?
[00:58:39.129 --> 00:58:39.769]  Are you done, sir?
[00:58:39.969 --> 00:58:40.530]  Yes, thanks.
[00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:41.650]  Good to hear from you.
[00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:43.431]  Thanks for holding to make those fine points.
[00:58:44.331 --> 00:58:47.592]  Alright, everybody else, your calls and a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to.
[00:58:48.333 --> 00:58:49.413]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:59:02.683]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:59:02.844 --> 00:59:10.426]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:10.666 --> 00:59:13.829]  Farm full or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:19.835]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:59:20.136 --> 00:59:26.282]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:59:26.642 --> 00:59:30.545]  The Berkey Light is transparent so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:59:30.585 --> 00:59:32.507]  The water level is always visible.
[00:59:32.667 --> 00:59:38.592]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in an emergency situation.
[00:59:38.852 --> 00:59:45.017]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only two hundred and fifty nine dollars by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:45.057 --> 00:59:46.118]  That's toll free, triple 8, 803-4438.
[00:59:58.208 --> 01:00:02.371]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:03.031 --> 01:00:03.852]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.612 --> 01:00:05.513]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.533 --> 01:00:09.876]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:14.479]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.502 --> 01:00:22.004]  Alright, my friends, now we're into Hour 2.
[01:00:22.544 --> 01:00:26.847]  Congressman Ron Paul from Texas will be joining us.
[01:00:27.797 --> 01:00:40.723]  In the next hour, talk about the draft, Patriot Act II, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the New World Order, Bush cutting Taiwan loose, you name it.
[01:00:41.703 --> 01:00:47.946]  By the way, the Communist Chinese are thanking Bush again today for what he did cutting Taiwan loose.
[01:00:49.367 --> 01:00:52.408]  Changing 53 years of treaty obligations.
[01:00:53.755 --> 01:01:03.041]  It's now coming out, what we can already tell from the evidence, that Saddam had been held for at least three weeks by the Kurds, and that that was a staged capture.
[01:01:03.061 --> 01:01:10.125]  Then you watch the video of Colonel Hinckley telling the troops, keep their mouths shut, let me tell you the official story.
[01:01:10.145 --> 01:01:13.267]  And that was on CNN of all places, they don't even hide this stuff.
[01:01:15.448 --> 01:01:17.770]  It's amazing, we're on the Hyphen Terror Alert.
[01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:25.513]  Uh, members of FEMA, federal and state have said that if we go to a red alert, we're all going to be basically slaves and have no rights.
[01:01:25.713 --> 01:01:29.935]  Well, the comment was by Sid Kaspersen, virtually all your liberties will be stripped away.
[01:01:29.955 --> 01:01:32.797]  You'll be an enemy combatant if you leave your home.
[01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:37.839]  That's the head of FEMA operations in New Jersey and Gannett News Service.
[01:01:38.239 --> 01:01:40.460]  That is, by the way, in police state, three total enslavement.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:46.802]  We're about to go to Garrett and Brandon and John and Jonathan and many, many others.
[01:01:47.283 --> 01:01:49.663]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:58.392]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:58.932 --> 01:02:01.754]  Let's talk to Garrett in Louisiana.
[01:02:01.794 --> 01:02:02.454]  Go ahead, Garrett.
[01:02:02.674 --> 01:02:03.775]  How you doing, Alex, man?
[01:02:04.055 --> 01:02:04.715]  Fine, my friend.
[01:02:07.217 --> 01:02:09.218]  Things are coming down heavy.
[01:02:11.179 --> 01:02:16.662]  I was wondering when you're going to have Jim Rawls on again as a guest on your show.
[01:02:18.323 --> 01:02:19.023]  Jim who?
[01:02:19.183 --> 01:02:23.566]  Jim Rawls, Patriots surviving a chemical collapse author.
[01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:26.752]  Oh, John Wesley Rawls, yes.
[01:02:27.773 --> 01:02:28.955]  I do need to interview him.
[01:02:28.975 --> 01:02:34.484]  I also want to interview Mr. Chittum of Civil War II.
[01:02:34.504 --> 01:02:36.347]  Yeah, that's a good book too.
[01:02:37.009 --> 01:02:46.074]  It's a little bit different race type issues, but it's a scenario.
[01:02:46.114 --> 01:02:46.934]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:50.837]  Reading that book, it just talks about what's going to happen.
[01:02:51.517 --> 01:02:55.159]  Because they are creating racial divides, they are balkanizing the country.
[01:02:55.559 --> 01:02:59.581]  I'm not saying he's a racist, it just shows what's going to happen.
[01:02:59.961 --> 01:03:03.723]  And I'm in one of the worst places that I could ever want to be.
[01:03:05.268 --> 01:03:21.962]  Anyway, um, people would like, if a person, if there's a man out there at Christmas time that's went and bought $8,000 for his wife a ring, I would suggest he take it back if he's got the receipt and go buy him a weapon and some ammunition because, uh, things fixin' to get bad.
[01:03:23.007 --> 01:03:41.174]  A lot of people are saying that, and my antenna are up, and I don't mean for Christmas, but here before the election, I've got a really bad feeling from all the evidence I'm looking at, kind of doing a prime projection on what I see happening, and I tell you, we're on the razor's edge.
[01:03:41.774 --> 01:03:47.077]  If we get the word out about who's behind the terror, we may back them off, but that is...
[01:03:49.702 --> 01:03:54.506]  Statistically, that's the minority future I see.
[01:03:54.986 --> 01:03:55.506]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:56.147 --> 01:03:59.469]  And I'm glad you're going to have Ron Paul on to talk about Patriot Act II.
[01:03:59.549 --> 01:04:07.215]  A friend of mine who listens to your show regularly says that you discussed it the other day that they had ramrodded through the 1st of December.
[01:04:08.115 --> 01:04:10.017]  And I'd like to hear more about that.
[01:04:10.097 --> 01:04:11.718]  But keep going, man.
[01:04:12.118 --> 01:04:16.942]  This movement and this effort is like a football team.
[01:04:18.052 --> 01:04:25.576]  Everybody's got their part to play, and you know, everybody's got to be a team player, and you're doing your part, and we're doing our part.
[01:04:26.637 --> 01:04:28.218]  God bless, and keep going, man.
[01:04:28.438 --> 01:04:29.419]  Well, thank you, Garrett.
[01:04:29.459 --> 01:04:30.299]  You too, my friend.
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:34.101]  All right, your call's coming up in more news after this quick break.
[01:04:34.722 --> 01:04:44.587]  It's all about freedom, all about liberty, all about chronicling the criminal activities of the global elite, also known as the New World Order.
[01:04:44.727 --> 01:04:45.448]  I mean, folks,
[01:04:46.855 --> 01:04:49.677]  These people are absolute total criminals.
[01:04:50.537 --> 01:04:51.258]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:53.659 --> 01:04:58.002]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:58.182 --> 01:05:02.604]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:02.764 --> 01:05:07.127]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:05:07.187 --> 01:05:08.528]  The New World Order.
[01:05:09.168 --> 01:05:10.690]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:24.125 --> 01:05:24.365]  Oh my-
[01:05:54.365 --> 01:05:59.087]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:05:59.227 --> 01:05:59.847]  Yes, it's true.
[01:05:59.867 --> 01:06:02.608]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:06:02.748 --> 01:06:06.730]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:07.390]  You heard it right.
[01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:12.512]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:06:12.612 --> 01:06:13.632]  The list goes on and on.
[01:06:13.892 --> 01:06:17.937]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[01:06:18.037 --> 01:06:20.160]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:21.541]  This is a limited time offer.
[01:06:21.661 --> 01:06:25.926]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[01:06:26.087 --> 01:06:27.909]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.
[01:06:30.572 --> 01:06:35.035]  Remember, to participate in this limited time offer and have your drugs prescribed over the phone for free, you need to call 1-800-615-7094 now.
[01:06:35.136 --> 01:06:39.039]  That's 1-800-615-7094 for drugs like Phentermine, Ambien, Fioriset, Sama, Ultram, Viagra and many more.
[01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:40.420]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.360]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[01:06:53.044 --> 01:06:56.306]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:06:56.366 --> 01:07:00.528]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:07:00.788 --> 01:07:03.589]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:06.171]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:07:06.371 --> 01:07:15.015]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:07:15.215 --> 01:07:16.556]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:07:16.736 --> 01:07:20.998]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:07:21.218 --> 01:07:22.959]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:07:23.199 --> 01:07:35.147]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:07:35.347 --> 01:07:41.912]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:07:42.112 --> 01:07:45.294]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:07:54.523 --> 01:07:56.706]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:57.287 --> 01:08:00.090]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:10.371]  All right, I'm about to go back to your calls.
[01:08:10.411 --> 01:08:11.551]  Everybody be patient.
[01:08:11.891 --> 01:08:17.114]  Let me just recap some top stories, hit a few I haven't gotten to yet in detail, then we'll go right back to your calls.
[01:08:17.674 --> 01:08:24.717]  The toll-free number to join us on this Open Line Monday edition, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:26.858 --> 01:08:29.939]  We got him, Kurds say they caught Saddam Hussein.
[01:08:31.159 --> 01:08:34.341]  Saddam held by Kurds, drugged and left for U.S.
[01:08:34.381 --> 01:08:34.641]  troops.
[01:08:34.681 --> 01:08:36.802]  That's out of ABC News.
[01:08:38.050 --> 01:08:40.232]  Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S.
[01:08:40.272 --> 01:08:51.720]  troops only after he had been taken prisoner by Kurdish forces, drugged and abandoned, ready for American soldiers to recover him, a British newspaper has reported, according to British intelligence.
[01:08:52.781 --> 01:09:04.610]  Also, a respected photographer and journalist for a major Australian newspaper, The Weekend Australian, and you can see the photos on my websites, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com,
[01:09:05.615 --> 01:09:08.618]  Uh, Saddam's got an injection port, an IV port in his arm.
[01:09:08.638 --> 01:09:10.340]  He looks totally drugged out and beaten.
[01:09:10.921 --> 01:09:14.024]  Worse than he looked, uh, eight days ago.
[01:09:15.126 --> 01:09:16.047]  When they captured him.
[01:09:16.587 --> 01:09:17.188]  Supposedly.
[01:09:18.409 --> 01:09:19.210]  Very serious.
[01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:20.812]  They're saying they're gonna try Saddam.
[01:09:22.498 --> 01:09:32.938]  Well, it could take a few years to even get the trial going, so he'll be portrayed properly, just like our troops that were shot down over Vietnam would say whatever the Vietnamese wanted him to say.
[01:09:32.978 --> 01:09:35.303]  Don't worry, Saddam will say whatever the globalists want him to say.
[01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:39.312]  He won't talk about how he's business partners with the entire Bush crime family.
[01:09:39.932 --> 01:09:42.793]  Saddam verdict expected to take five years.
[01:09:43.254 --> 01:09:54.979]  Iraq officials and judges involved in setting up Baghdad's new war crimes court have revealed that Saddam Hussein's trial would not be finished for five years despite the clamor for speedy justice since his arrest last week.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:03.444]  The desire among many ordinary Iraqis for their former dictator to be tried rapidly must be sacrificed to the need for a full and open hearing.
[01:10:05.277 --> 01:10:08.821]  That satisfies international legal standards, officials said.
[01:10:09.903 --> 01:10:16.190]  It will obviously cause impatience among the Iraqi people, but I don't think that there is anything that can be done about that.
[01:10:17.231 --> 01:10:24.319]  No, he's got to spend a lot of time in the ministry of love, like Winston did in 1984, and then he can love Big Brother.
[01:10:27.446 --> 01:10:34.648]  And he did get visited by the torture master, Dr. Chalibi, who's the admitted number two man for the Shah of Iran for torture.
[01:10:35.188 --> 01:10:36.608]  Also convicted bank robber.
[01:10:37.449 --> 01:10:41.630]  Wanted by our allies in Jordan for stealing 300 million dollars from a bank.
[01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:47.631]  But again, it's good when we torture, bad when Saddam tortures.
[01:10:47.671 --> 01:10:48.932]  We've got to learn the double thing.
[01:10:49.752 --> 01:10:52.012]  Rumsfeld says we may need a bigger army.
[01:10:52.072 --> 01:10:54.413]  Donald Rumsfeld tells Time Magazine.
[01:10:55.157 --> 01:11:05.167]  We may need a bigger army, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld tells TIME and this week's person of the year, WSU, on newsstands for two weeks beginning Monday, December 22nd.
[01:11:05.207 --> 01:11:07.109]  Ooh, I've got to have one of those.
[01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:14.576]  Rumsfeld has been under pressure from Congress to expand the military by at least two divisions or 20,000 troops.
[01:11:16.167 --> 01:11:33.280]  Times Washington Bureau Chief Michael Duffy and Pentagon correspondent Mark Thompson report the Secretary resisted the pressure over the summer and fall, but in his conversation with Time, he said he was studying it more closely now, opening the door to a deal.
[01:11:35.381 --> 01:11:37.243]  And news is out of Washington.
[01:11:37.283 --> 01:11:40.705]  They're getting ready to pass the draft after the next terror attack, folks.
[01:11:40.825 --> 01:11:41.706]  So get ready for that.
[01:11:43.637 --> 01:11:46.959]  Really serious news that we need to cover here.
[01:11:48.339 --> 01:11:51.320]  Dollar drop becomes more ominous.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.421]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:11:53.381 --> 01:12:03.525]  After months of looking at nothing but the bright side of a weaker dollar, investors are starting to look at the darker side of its struggle against the Euro.
[01:12:04.466 --> 01:12:05.226]  There's no struggle.
[01:12:05.326 --> 01:12:09.428]  Bush has had Snow, Treasury Secretary, out bad-mouthing it.
[01:12:11.616 --> 01:12:13.137]  Saying a dropping dollar is good.
[01:12:13.157 --> 01:12:17.740]  Demand for the dollar has been dampened by concerns about the widening U.S.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:19.101]  current account deficit.
[01:12:19.822 --> 01:12:21.723]  We have a $43 trillion deficit.
[01:12:22.303 --> 01:12:24.365]  And expectations that benchmark U.S.
[01:12:24.445 --> 01:12:25.946]  interest rates will remain low.
[01:12:26.778 --> 01:12:31.002]  For most of the past six months, that has seen a positive for the most part, as U.S.
[01:12:31.022 --> 01:12:34.484]  goods and services became cheaper compared with those produced overseas.
[01:12:35.245 --> 01:12:42.951]  Folks, there are no American goods to speak of, maybe a toilet plunger, maybe napkins, maybe something like that.
[01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:48.136]  No, the trade deficit got bigger than ever in the last six months, by the way.
[01:12:49.177 --> 01:12:50.858]  Now, though, investors are looking at the
[01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:56.771]  Pace of the dollar's decline, fearing that an orderly drop in demand may turn into a rout.
[01:12:57.511 --> 01:13:08.334]  See, four years ago, three and a half years ago, the World Economic Forum in Switzerland said we want an orderly drop and decline of the dollar so the American middle class doesn't struggle.
[01:13:09.974 --> 01:13:15.135]  And then I've heard NPR a month ago bragging, yes, they will teach Americans how to live in their means.
[01:13:16.116 --> 01:13:18.096]  We're being turned into a third world country, folks.
[01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:25.495]  Indeed, this past week several large companies said the weak dollar continues to be a boon to corporate results.
[01:13:27.016 --> 01:13:27.597]  Oh, yes.
[01:13:28.978 --> 01:13:33.542]  General Mills, folks, says they're making more money on their cereal.
[01:13:33.582 --> 01:13:36.845]  That's a vital, vital thing there.
[01:13:37.725 --> 01:13:39.325]  Doomsday scenario.
[01:13:39.865 --> 01:13:55.648]  Few are expecting such a doomsday scenario, but with the dollar at a 7-year low against the Swiss franc, an 11-year low against the British pound, and the Euro enjoying an 18% gain this year, investors are hoping that the dollar is closer to the bottom than not.
[01:13:56.448 --> 01:13:57.728]  If the reluctance to hold U.S.
[01:13:57.788 --> 01:13:59.149]  security spreads to U.S.
[01:13:59.269 --> 01:14:06.270]  Treasuries, interest rates will also rise, potentially jeopardizing the economic recovery.
[01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:11.185]  This is one of the slickest forms of inflation.
[01:14:12.745 --> 01:14:20.729]  And it usually takes six months to a year after a currency drops for the full effect to be felt.
[01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:26.832]  That is, your dollar in the last year and a half has dropped by 36%.
[01:14:33.058 --> 01:14:35.059]  18% this year alone.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:41.602]  36% in the last, what is it?
[01:14:41.622 --> 01:14:42.583]  18, 19 months.
[01:14:43.083 --> 01:14:44.444]  Now it's 20 months, excuse me.
[01:14:45.224 --> 01:14:46.205]  Coming up on two years.
[01:14:47.685 --> 01:14:52.668]  And it's dropping about a cent a week against the Euro.
[01:14:55.789 --> 01:14:56.809]  That's massive, folks.
[01:14:57.670 --> 01:14:58.310]  That's massive.
[01:14:59.391 --> 01:14:59.911]  That's huge.
[01:15:01.975 --> 01:15:05.710]  Now, why do you think the stock market is up by about 6%?
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:20.842]  Because of the dollars down by 36 percent, it's going to take more dollars to buy that stock, and so the stocks should, if we were just staying even, go up by 36 percent.
[01:15:21.223 --> 01:15:23.963]  But it only went up by 6 percent.
[01:15:24.383 --> 01:15:31.925]  It's fluctuating between 5 and 7 percent, the stock market being up from its low of two and a half years ago, or right before 9-11 and right after 9-11.
[01:15:33.265 --> 01:15:34.445]  So there's your inflation.
[01:15:35.803 --> 01:15:42.305]  And in the next few months, you're going to start seeing the price of items across the board go up.
[01:15:45.446 --> 01:15:48.767]  And if you have money in the bank, it has been devalued by 30 plus percent.
[01:15:52.535 --> 01:15:55.716]  Another fear is that strengthening global economy will make it harder for U.S.
[01:15:55.736 --> 01:15:57.576]  to fund its current account deficit.
[01:15:57.836 --> 01:15:59.736]  Yeah, people aren't buying the treasury bonds, folks.
[01:16:00.016 --> 01:16:04.877]  And investors move into strengthening currencies and cyclical economic regions like Asia.
[01:16:05.377 --> 01:16:05.777]  The U.S.
[01:16:05.857 --> 01:16:10.818]  also faces a unique problem in the commodities such as oil and base metals are priced in the dollars.
[01:16:11.998 --> 01:16:14.199]  Because then dollars can't buy as much oil.
[01:16:14.599 --> 01:16:15.219]  You understand?
[01:16:15.239 --> 01:16:19.060]  It can't buy as much coal oil, as much natural gas.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.480]  And remember,
[01:16:22.085 --> 01:16:28.307]  This is very important, folks, that this also affects Social Security.
[01:16:28.827 --> 01:16:31.027]  It affects the entire government.
[01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:35.089]  So what do you think about them apples, my friends?
[01:16:36.269 --> 01:16:39.990]  We'll get into more of the news here in just a few minutes.
[01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:44.771]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:16:45.611 --> 01:16:47.532]  Let's talk to John in Illinois.
[01:16:47.592 --> 01:16:48.392]  John, you're on the air.
[01:16:48.432 --> 01:16:48.832]  Go ahead.
[01:16:49.392 --> 01:16:49.813]  Hi, Alex.
[01:16:50.113 --> 01:16:50.393]  Hello.
[01:16:50.713 --> 01:16:51.473]  Great show, man.
[01:16:52.045 --> 01:16:55.407]  Listen, I got through to the call screener this morning on Rush Limbaugh's show.
[01:16:56.207 --> 01:16:57.348]  Let me tell you how I was treated.
[01:16:58.728 --> 01:17:03.631]  Just to prove again that he's nothing but a puppet, the call screener asked me, what do you want to ask?
[01:17:03.711 --> 01:17:05.952]  And I said, well, he had Tom Ridge on this morning.
[01:17:05.972 --> 01:17:13.436]  I don't know if you knew that, but he had Tom Ridge on his show for about four or five minutes, asking stupid questions and not giving him any hard questions.
[01:17:13.896 --> 01:17:18.238]  And I said, well, I'd like to ask him, how come you want to legalize eight million illegal aliens?
[01:17:18.859 --> 01:17:21.140]  And I no sooner got that out of my mouth, the guy said,
[01:17:21.485 --> 01:17:23.727]  Well, you're going to have to call his office in Washington, D.C.
[01:17:23.847 --> 01:17:24.147]  Click.
[01:17:26.389 --> 01:17:28.771]  They don't want that kind of a call on their program, Alex.
[01:17:29.152 --> 01:17:30.413]  Yeah, that's why I told you.
[01:17:30.433 --> 01:17:32.655]  You should have said, I love Ridge!
[01:17:33.075 --> 01:17:35.017]  I'm sick of these liberals!
[01:17:37.199 --> 01:17:38.780]  Now, I mean, do that voice.
[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.042]  You will be on the air instantly.
[01:17:41.062 --> 01:17:43.004]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you what.
[01:17:43.024 --> 01:17:48.109]  I was going to also ask them, how come they have this orange or red alert, whatever it is.
[01:17:48.996 --> 01:17:51.219]  I mean, I have a lot of questions for these people.
[01:17:51.279 --> 01:17:52.421]  Of course, that would be a perfect question.
[01:18:06.693 --> 01:18:08.114]  For Ridge or for Limbaugh.
[01:18:09.294 --> 01:18:11.756]  They're so conservative, why are they for amnesty?
[01:18:11.796 --> 01:18:12.776]  They say 8 million.
[01:18:12.816 --> 01:18:15.657]  It's more like 25 to 30 million illegals here.
[01:18:16.238 --> 01:18:18.279]  Why are you for amnesty for them?
[01:18:18.339 --> 01:18:20.640]  Why are you accepting their fake matricula cards?
[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:22.301]  But of course not.
[01:18:22.361 --> 01:18:24.102]  We can't allow that.
[01:18:24.962 --> 01:18:28.304]  We've got to keep the illusion of conservatism going.
[01:18:28.644 --> 01:18:34.507]  Don't want to rile up 20 million people that could save this country if they weren't sucking their thumbs.
[01:18:35.382 --> 01:18:43.510]  And I also wanted to ask why the governor of Illinois wants to give driver's licenses to a half a million illegals in the state of Illinois alone.
[01:18:43.530 --> 01:18:46.073]  Well, they always say half a million.
[01:18:46.093 --> 01:18:46.894]  It'll be more than that.
[01:18:46.914 --> 01:18:48.916]  Yeah, well, that's what they estimate.
[01:18:48.936 --> 01:18:50.838]  But whatever number, it doesn't matter.
[01:18:51.385 --> 01:18:52.846]  I know that then they'll be able to vote.
[01:18:53.086 --> 01:18:54.006]  Well, I know this now.
[01:18:54.046 --> 01:18:57.547]  If you have a parking ticket in most states, you can't get a license or renew it.
[01:18:57.907 --> 01:19:00.628]  But yeah, illegals can walk in, no ID, no nothing.
[01:19:00.668 --> 01:19:04.010]  Here's your driver's license in a bunch of states and cities now.
[01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:06.991]  And, oh, that's Homeland Security.
[01:19:07.671 --> 01:19:15.894]  And they also showed the pictures at O'Hare Airport here today of these black-masked men with fully automatic rifles walking around.
[01:19:17.014 --> 01:19:19.095]  It was police on the back of their uniform.
[01:19:19.665 --> 01:19:22.327]  And everybody's getting used to this police state nonsense.
[01:19:22.487 --> 01:19:23.027]  Well, that's it.
[01:19:23.067 --> 01:19:23.828]  They're equating.
[01:19:23.868 --> 01:19:27.950]  They'll show some Taliban and then they'll cut to the good guys in their black ski masks.
[01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:28.511]  Right.
[01:19:29.131 --> 01:19:30.272]  Shoving us around.
[01:19:30.352 --> 01:19:32.253]  Stand forth for detention.
[01:19:32.873 --> 01:19:35.355]  We're gonna search everybody.
[01:19:35.475 --> 01:19:36.415]  It's part of your freedom.
[01:19:38.817 --> 01:19:39.277]  Good point.
[01:19:39.297 --> 01:19:40.238]  See anything else, John?
[01:19:40.358 --> 01:19:40.738]  That's it.
[01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:41.238]  Thank you.
[01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:42.019]  Good to hear from you.
[01:19:42.702 --> 01:19:45.404]  Yeah, if you want to get through on a neocon show, you gotta do this.
[01:19:46.085 --> 01:19:48.347]  I just love what they're doing!
[01:19:48.447 --> 01:19:50.689]  I'm sick of these liberals!

[01:21:18.126 --> 01:21:26.572]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:21:26.753 --> 01:21:33.137]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as leads, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[01:22:35.593 --> 01:22:40.417]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.

[01:23:48.442 --> 01:23:50.903]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[01:23:54.646 --> 01:23:57.408]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:23:57.968 --> 01:24:01.331]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:03.452 --> 01:24:04.393]  All right, my friends.
[01:24:04.473 --> 01:24:07.515]  Coming up, Israel planning to attack Iran.
[01:24:08.425 --> 01:24:09.486]  That's what they're saying.
[01:24:09.766 --> 01:24:13.309]  Clinton agrees with Bush that Saddam is Al Qaeda, of course.
[01:24:14.409 --> 01:24:16.311]  More on RFID tracker chips.
[01:24:16.371 --> 01:24:20.574]  Police call for remote button to stop all your cars.
[01:24:21.775 --> 01:24:26.118]  Parents told shouting at youth football matches is child abuse.
[01:24:27.178 --> 01:24:29.220]  That's right folks, now shouting at your children.
[01:24:30.246 --> 01:24:31.927]  Power restored to San Francisco.
[01:24:31.988 --> 01:24:32.868]  What was behind that?
[01:24:33.028 --> 01:24:36.611]  China thanks Bush again for Taiwan stance.
[01:24:36.831 --> 01:24:39.673]  Buffett saw terror threat before it happened.
[01:24:40.033 --> 01:24:41.114]  Yeah, I know you did.
[01:24:41.915 --> 01:24:44.677]  And much, much, much more.
[01:24:45.658 --> 01:24:56.866]  I would like to hear from some of these callers about this news coming out by British intelligence that Saddam had been captured weeks before by the Kurds and that whole capture by U.S.
[01:24:56.906 --> 01:24:58.287]  troops was staged.
[01:25:00.237 --> 01:25:02.838]  Let's go ahead and go to Jonathan in Georgia.
[01:25:02.898 --> 01:25:03.938]  Jonathan, you're on the air.
[01:25:03.978 --> 01:25:04.418]  Go ahead.
[01:25:04.718 --> 01:25:05.298]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:06.258 --> 01:25:17.060]  I can understand why the Kurds would want to torture Hussein to some extent after the gassing and all, but I think it was okay for the U.S.
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:18.101]  to torture.
[01:25:18.141 --> 01:25:25.122]  I think it was a colonel that tortured Iran-Iraqi during an interrogation by grazing his ear with bullets.
[01:25:25.925 --> 01:25:27.206]  And he got discharged for that.
[01:25:27.226 --> 01:25:29.287]  That was like a couple of months ago or something like that.
[01:25:29.367 --> 01:25:30.427]  I don't know if you remember that.
[01:25:31.188 --> 01:25:39.091]  But, um, I don't know where, I don't know where this thing, it sounds to me like it's okay for everyone else to torture but us.
[01:25:39.111 --> 01:25:41.893]  That sounds like Geneva Convention rhetoric to me.
[01:25:41.913 --> 01:25:44.194]  Okay, I gotta stop you right there.
[01:25:46.673 --> 01:25:55.337]  Because you obviously disagree with me, and I want to keep you on because I want to flesh this out, Jeff, and so if we hit this break, don't hang up.
[01:25:55.577 --> 01:25:56.717]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:25:56.797 --> 01:25:58.858]  Okay, I want to go over something here with you.
[01:25:59.058 --> 01:25:59.338]  Yeah.
[01:26:00.659 --> 01:26:05.521]  Number one, you can't trust a government that will torture.
[01:26:06.341 --> 01:26:11.083]  Number two, you can't trust what comes out of confessions from torture.
[01:26:12.179 --> 01:26:13.060]  History shows this.
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:18.704]  Number three, I would imagine you think Joseph Mingala was bad for torturing people.
[01:26:18.725 --> 01:26:22.388]  I would imagine you think Fidel Castro is bad for torturing.
[01:26:23.188 --> 01:26:26.851]  I would imagine you think those people were bad for torturing, correct?
[01:26:27.592 --> 01:26:27.932]  Yeah.
[01:26:28.933 --> 01:26:36.419]  So, how would it be okay for our government to torture people?
[01:26:36.879 --> 01:26:41.023]  Well, in the case of that colonel that got discharged, he helped save
[01:26:42.059 --> 01:26:47.540]  Soldiers from an ambush or something during a raid they were having.
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.321]  Okay, okay.
[01:26:51.741 --> 01:26:59.023]  Did you know that the Revolutionary War, we didn't torture anybody and we treated the Redcoats with respect and that ended up helping us?
[01:26:59.503 --> 01:27:03.224]  Did you know the British did torture and that blew up in their face?
[01:27:03.764 --> 01:27:05.244]  So you don't know what you're talking about.
[01:27:05.959 --> 01:27:07.720]  Well, that's what I thought about.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.500]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:12.903]  The northern Vietnamese, when our jets would get shot down, would torture people.
[01:27:13.323 --> 01:27:14.944]  And they said, oh, it's to get intelligence.
[01:27:15.644 --> 01:27:18.065]  Now, are you saying it was okay for them to torture our pilots?
[01:27:18.125 --> 01:27:20.387]  It would save communist lives.
[01:27:21.507 --> 01:27:22.868]  Alex, there were no pilots.
[01:27:22.888 --> 01:27:24.709]  We didn't even dive-bomb those guys.
[01:27:25.643 --> 01:27:35.208]  Oh, you're saying pilots didn't get tortured by the... We weren't allowed to go over there, we weren't allowed to bomb them, we weren't allowed to gather intelligence, we weren't allowed to do anything.
[01:27:35.228 --> 01:27:40.490]  You really are... Sir, sir, we did have soldiers, we did have a lot of pilots captured.
[01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:41.350]  Now, now, come on.
[01:27:42.071 --> 01:27:44.592]  No, you know we weren't allowed to bomb or do anything.
[01:27:44.612 --> 01:27:46.613]  Now, sir... I've heard you admit it before.
[01:27:46.653 --> 01:27:49.594]  Sir, John McCain was in custody.
[01:27:50.375 --> 01:27:53.236]  Are you saying we didn't have people shot down and tortured?
[01:27:54.204 --> 01:27:57.128]  Who could be shot down when we're not allowed to fly over it?
[01:27:57.488 --> 01:27:59.530]  Otherwise we'd have bombed the daylights out of them.
[01:27:59.811 --> 01:28:01.553]  How long have you been listening to this show?
[01:28:01.573 --> 01:28:04.236]  A couple of years.
[01:28:05.738 --> 01:28:10.924]  And all this time listening, you don't know that we had people shot down over Vietnam?
[01:28:13.337 --> 01:28:17.459]  Well, Alex, I mean, I did a whole report for history class once on Vietnam.
[01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:19.760]  Oh, you did a history class?
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:22.842]  I was all over the library.
[01:28:22.942 --> 01:28:25.403]  Sir, do you know about the SAM missile batteries?
[01:28:25.423 --> 01:28:28.684]  You didn't know we had thousands of aircraft shot down?
[01:28:29.845 --> 01:28:31.045]  There were no aircraft.
[01:28:31.085 --> 01:28:31.966]  We weren't allowed to bomb them.
[01:28:32.006 --> 01:28:32.926]  Thousands!
[01:28:33.126 --> 01:28:34.567]  Thousands!
[01:28:34.747 --> 01:28:35.988]  Thousands!
[01:28:36.828 --> 01:28:38.729]  Doing if we weren't allowed to bomb them.
[01:28:39.389 --> 01:28:40.170]  Answer me that.
[01:28:41.210 --> 01:28:42.991]  That was Hanoi we couldn't bomb.
[01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:49.756]  Now, let me stop you for just a second because I'm trying to understand this.
[01:28:49.816 --> 01:28:51.698]  There weren't any pilots shot down in Vietnam.
[01:28:51.738 --> 01:28:54.640]  You're wrong, but let's just say you're right.
[01:28:56.541 --> 01:28:59.403]  Let's go back to torture here.
[01:29:00.284 --> 01:29:03.747]  You cannot trust confessions from people that have been tortured.
[01:29:03.807 --> 01:29:05.628]  You can't trust governments that torture.
[01:29:06.028 --> 01:29:08.150]  How can you say Joseph Mingle is bad?
[01:29:09.347 --> 01:29:14.690]  Or how can you say that, you know, the Russians were bad for torturing, but we're good when we do it?
[01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:17.231]  Because we don't torture.
[01:29:17.431 --> 01:29:18.811]  We don't torture our criminals.
[01:29:19.532 --> 01:29:21.372]  We beat them up a lot sometimes.
[01:29:21.453 --> 01:29:22.893]  I see it on cops every week.
[01:29:22.953 --> 01:29:25.334]  But that's not torture, beating somebody up.
[01:29:25.794 --> 01:29:27.275]  Beating somebody up isn't torture.
[01:29:29.136 --> 01:29:30.216]  Putting a bag over their head.
[01:29:30.417 --> 01:29:33.318]  Hey, I tell you what, stay there, please, my friend.
[01:29:33.358 --> 01:29:34.318]  I'm being nice to you.
[01:29:35.359 --> 01:29:35.779]  All right?
[01:29:36.579 --> 01:29:38.040]  Just stay there, Jonathan, will you?
[01:29:38.826 --> 01:29:40.488]  Because I want to hear some more from you.
[01:29:41.589 --> 01:29:42.329]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:44.291 --> 01:29:45.192]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.692 --> 01:29:47.294]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.214 --> 01:29:50.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.272 --> 01:29:56.714]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[01:29:56.774 --> 01:29:57.295]  Pollution.
[01:29:57.315 --> 01:29:57.615]  Pollen.
[01:29:57.655 --> 01:29:58.776]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[01:29:58.836 --> 01:29:59.237]  Allergies.
[01:29:59.377 --> 01:29:59.657]  Asthma.
[01:29:59.697 --> 01:30:00.257]  Probably not.
[01:30:00.418 --> 01:30:01.138]  Well, listen to this.
[01:30:01.378 --> 01:30:10.346]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[01:30:10.427 --> 01:30:11.247]  Six to ten times.
[01:30:11.287 --> 01:30:12.348]  How can that be, you ask?
[01:30:12.428 --> 01:30:12.689]  Worse.
[01:30:12.789 --> 01:30:14.130]  Think about what's inside your home.
[01:30:14.290 --> 01:30:14.951]  Hairspray.
[01:30:15.051 --> 01:30:15.571]  Chemicals.
[01:30:15.851 --> 01:30:16.552]  Does anyone smoke?
[01:30:16.572 --> 01:30:16.792]  Fumes.
[01:30:16.972 --> 01:30:18.594]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[01:30:19.094 --> 01:30:21.156]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[01:30:21.456 --> 01:30:22.617]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:26.499]  They go into you, into your children, into their lungs.
[01:30:26.559 --> 01:30:27.360]  Am I scaring you?
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.581]  Remember this word?
[01:30:28.981 --> 01:30:29.721]  Puritech.
[01:30:29.761 --> 01:30:31.282]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[01:30:31.342 --> 01:30:33.524]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[01:30:33.684 --> 01:30:46.232]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, DOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[01:30:46.332 --> 01:30:47.573]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[01:30:54.238 --> 01:30:54.679]  Gold.
[01:30:55.019 --> 01:30:56.320]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:02.645]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:31:02.845 --> 01:31:06.668]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:08.910]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:31:08.970 --> 01:31:11.252]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:31:11.392 --> 01:31:16.516]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat
[01:31:16.696 --> 01:31:17.016]  We're good.
[01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:32.583]  We're good to go.
[01:31:55.839 --> 01:32:01.323]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:32:01.763 --> 01:32:06.306]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:32:06.427 --> 01:32:13.251]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:32:13.632 --> 01:32:19.756]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:32:19.776 --> 01:32:21.097]  There are no side effects.
[01:32:21.437 --> 01:32:24.380]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[01:32:51.904 --> 01:32:52.524]  Call today.
[01:32:58.966 --> 01:33:00.866]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:01.366 --> 01:33:04.187]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:09.309]  All right, folks.
[01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:12.530]  Kim and Mark and Alan and Sean.
[01:33:13.698 --> 01:33:17.522]  And others, your calls are coming up and a lot of the different news items I was mentioning.
[01:33:18.302 --> 01:33:21.465]  Police call for remote control button of your cars.
[01:33:23.267 --> 01:33:27.451]  You know, the hardware is already in your ignition for all the new cars built in the last 7-8 years.
[01:33:28.672 --> 01:33:33.276]  Some cases 9-10 years, but it became mainstream about 7-8 years ago.
[01:33:33.296 --> 01:33:36.018]  And a lot of other key issues coming up.
[01:33:36.078 --> 01:33:39.541]  Congressman Ron Paul in the next hour to talk about the draft Patriot Act 2.
[01:33:41.623 --> 01:33:44.284]  Uh, the ballooning deficit, the open borders, all of that.
[01:33:46.705 --> 01:33:50.867]  Jonathan in Georgia called into the show, and he disagrees with me, so I respect him for that.
[01:33:50.887 --> 01:33:52.328]  I'm going to treat him with some respect.
[01:33:53.749 --> 01:34:03.253]  Um, I got into an argument with him about torture being a bad thing, and he said, well, you know, I agree with that officer who fired the gun by the guy's ear to make him talk and save lives.
[01:34:03.833 --> 01:34:07.155]  I thought we were going into Iraq because Saddam tortured people.
[01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:09.123]  Which he did.
[01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:19.652]  He was hired by the CIA in 1954, trained for two years in torture, assassination, Fort Benning, Georgia, right through 1990, was training tens of thousands of Republican Guard.
[01:34:19.672 --> 01:34:21.133]  That was one of the main groups there.
[01:34:21.554 --> 01:34:23.455]  This is congressional funding reports, folks.
[01:34:23.976 --> 01:34:24.596]  In torture.
[01:34:25.637 --> 01:34:29.601]  Electrodes to genitals, rubber hoses, lights, all of that.
[01:34:31.162 --> 01:34:34.405]  But Jonathan says that our police beat people up, but that's not torture.
[01:34:35.311 --> 01:34:36.332]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:34:36.772 --> 01:34:40.093]  If we're going to Iraq to stop the torture, which isn't the case.
[01:34:40.213 --> 01:34:45.195]  Bush said in the PNAC document it was for the oil and weapons sales and to use Iraq as a military base.
[01:34:45.655 --> 01:34:46.856]  But let's just say you're right.
[01:34:48.136 --> 01:34:52.578]  Why then would torture be okay for our troops to carry it out?
[01:34:52.638 --> 01:34:54.679]  Would you like to try to answer that question for me?
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:01.622]  Because he was trying to look after his men when he shot the thing at the guys ear.
[01:35:03.692 --> 01:35:05.052]  What more do you need to know?
[01:35:05.212 --> 01:35:16.596]  Well, we saw a local newscast, for these guys who were acquitted, by the way, for the yogurt shop murders, when they obviously didn't do it, here in Austin, and the cop put a gun to his head and cocked it.
[01:35:16.956 --> 01:35:20.197]  And they put that on the news, and people said, oh good, put guns to people's heads.
[01:35:20.677 --> 01:35:23.298]  Sir, that's not America.
[01:35:23.638 --> 01:35:28.100]  We never had to act like that before, and now the more we do it, the more trouble.
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:31.761]  Every law enforcement, hold on a second, hold on a second, hold on a second.
[01:35:33.161 --> 01:35:38.223]  I read law enforcement magazines all the time where they say, well if it'll save lives, maybe we should torture.
[01:35:38.763 --> 01:35:41.124]  Government has more power than anybody else.
[01:35:41.524 --> 01:35:43.125]  You want to restrict their powers.
[01:35:43.645 --> 01:35:49.027]  Even if it means some bad things are going to happen, because bad people generally get control of those levers of control.
[01:35:49.507 --> 01:35:52.848]  If they're going to torture in Iraq, they're going to torture here, buddy.
[01:35:53.148 --> 01:35:57.730]  And there's cases every week of police torturing people, getting convicted for it.
[01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.970]  You better hope
[01:35:59.310 --> 01:36:00.811]  Torture doesn't get normalized.
[01:36:00.851 --> 01:36:01.412]  Now go ahead.
[01:36:01.752 --> 01:36:13.680]  Well, for one thing, as far as law enforcement is concerned, I'm always hearing about gadgets that are non-lethal and shoot nets and rubber-coated bullets and all this other junk that they're trying not to do to save the criminals' lives.
[01:36:14.321 --> 01:36:16.302]  But, um, I don't know what you're reading.
[01:36:16.322 --> 01:36:17.003]  Stop right there.
[01:36:17.063 --> 01:36:18.484]  Let's take it point by point.
[01:36:19.385 --> 01:36:26.930]  You talk about when you're in a rally and they run up and spray babies in the face with maize and say you shouldn't be here and fire rubber bullets at crowds of old women.
[01:36:27.955 --> 01:36:28.856]  There are a lot of old women.
[01:36:28.876 --> 01:36:30.357]  There are no old women in those rallies.
[01:36:30.377 --> 01:36:31.117]  Those are war criminals.
[01:36:31.157 --> 01:36:32.979]  Yes, I got video of it in Portland, Oregon.
[01:36:33.559 --> 01:36:34.420]  Hey, hey, buddy.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:41.004]  You just said that we didn't have planes shot down in Vietnam and that our men weren't tortured.
[01:36:41.125 --> 01:36:43.006]  That's because they weren't allowed to fly over.
[01:36:43.026 --> 01:36:46.869]  That shows the most complete and total lack of history.
[01:36:47.089 --> 01:36:47.509]  And you know what?
[01:36:47.549 --> 01:36:48.750]  You're not alone, Jonathan.
[01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:49.911]  Let me tell you something.
[01:36:50.649 --> 01:36:57.364]  Over two-thirds of college administrators and students didn't know what the First Amendment was in a poll of 339 universities.
[01:36:57.384 --> 01:36:57.785]  So you know what?
[01:37:00.766 --> 01:37:03.507]  I know a lot of people are like you, but I care about you.
[01:37:03.607 --> 01:37:05.668]  I care about you being a free person, Jonathan.
[01:37:06.028 --> 01:37:21.554]  What are you going to do when you find out that we had thousands of jets, and prop planes, and C-130s, and B-52s, and Thunder Chiefs, and just tons of aircraft?
[01:37:21.694 --> 01:37:28.577]  And I expect you to expect me to believe that they all just shot the Vietnamese and bombed them and everything else.
[01:37:30.416 --> 01:37:30.696]  What?
[01:37:32.017 --> 01:37:44.007]  Yes, we had a war from 1964 to 1972, 1973, and we lost thousands of pilots, very brave men.
[01:37:44.547 --> 01:37:45.308]  Yes, yes.
[01:37:45.448 --> 01:37:47.189]  And the Vietnamese did torture them.
[01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:51.233]  They had them on TV saying America was bad after they'd been tortured.
[01:37:53.194 --> 01:37:54.255]  Yes, that did happen.
[01:37:54.295 --> 01:37:54.936]  Yes, it did.
[01:37:55.676 --> 01:37:56.597]  And torture's wrong.
[01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:57.778]  Anything else, Jonathan?
[01:37:59.975 --> 01:38:00.535]  I don't know.
[01:38:00.795 --> 01:38:03.296]  What are you reading about law enforcement magazines?
[01:38:03.976 --> 01:38:05.156]  What law enforcement?
[01:38:05.316 --> 01:38:10.917]  Firearms and Weapons of Law Enforcement, April 2001 issue, page 46.
[01:38:11.317 --> 01:38:12.898]  Gets into how wonderful torture is.
[01:38:12.918 --> 01:38:15.638]  You don't have a memory like that, do you, Jonathan?
[01:38:15.678 --> 01:38:16.278]  I wish you did.
[01:38:17.619 --> 01:38:20.679]  Well, I would like to hear an excerpt from that.
[01:38:20.739 --> 01:38:25.220]  You need to see my film, Road to Tyranny, where they say how good torture is.
[01:38:27.293 --> 01:38:29.895]  Have you seen him on the news saying how good torture is?
[01:38:33.118 --> 01:38:36.080]  Let me throw something else out here at you.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.381]  Put him on hold.
[01:38:37.701 --> 01:38:38.622]  I'll let you talk in a minute.
[01:38:39.262 --> 01:38:39.783]  Listen to me.
[01:38:40.804 --> 01:38:41.344]  Listen to me.
[01:38:41.784 --> 01:38:47.008]  General Rick Baucus, a two-star general, resigned.
[01:38:47.108 --> 01:38:48.309]  Then they said, no, you're fired.
[01:38:48.930 --> 01:38:53.553]  Last year because he refused to torture people at Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay.
[01:38:54.935 --> 01:38:55.315]  Okay?
[01:38:56.289 --> 01:38:57.569]  Do you understand that?
[01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:59.890]  They've been torturing and killing people.
[01:39:00.190 --> 01:39:03.211]  They lined up 3,000 Afghans in machine-gunned them.
[01:39:04.372 --> 01:39:05.052]  That's admitted.
[01:39:05.432 --> 01:39:07.213]  And they're not even real Taliban or Al-Qaeda.
[01:39:07.333 --> 01:39:11.334]  Okay, so they would just martyr these Afghans without getting any information from them first?
[01:39:11.394 --> 01:39:12.114]  That makes sense.
[01:39:12.455 --> 01:39:12.995]  It's admitted.
[01:39:13.955 --> 01:39:16.396]  Just like Vietnam's admitted, buddy, and you don't know about it.
[01:39:20.283 --> 01:39:23.424]  Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.
[01:39:23.465 --> 01:39:25.005]  That's not smart strategically.
[01:39:25.285 --> 01:39:27.086]  Okay, thanks for the call, I appreciate it.
[01:39:27.486 --> 01:39:28.606]  You're not listening to me.
[01:39:29.067 --> 01:39:30.427]  You're not listening to common sense.
[01:39:30.587 --> 01:39:35.949]  I'm on dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of AM and FM stations.
[01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:38.230]  Do you know why I'm on those stations?
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:49.526]  Because most of those station owners and managers heard me as a guest on their station four, five, six, two years ago, laying out everything that was going to happen.
[01:39:49.767 --> 01:39:51.808]  They didn't believe it then, but they had memories.
[01:39:52.068 --> 01:39:52.908]  They had IQs.
[01:39:53.089 --> 01:39:54.149]  They had brains.
[01:39:54.449 --> 01:39:58.852]  And after it all happened, they said, I don't care how wild this guy sounds, he's accurate.
[01:39:59.713 --> 01:40:02.214]  He's put down his predictions on videotape.
[01:40:02.655 --> 01:40:03.735]  He's laid out history.
[01:40:03.775 --> 01:40:04.956]  He's had the guest on.
[01:40:05.176 --> 01:40:06.237]  He's brought out the proof.
[01:40:06.986 --> 01:40:08.246]  He knows what he's talking about.
[01:40:08.606 --> 01:40:10.227]  Alex Jones has credibility.
[01:40:11.267 --> 01:40:33.272]  This guy that just called in, folks, and I don't want to be mean to him, I don't want to discourage that type of call, but that's the type of person I'll be on KOA or KFI or some big 50,000 water as a guest for two hours or some mom and pop will take 20-30 calls and one guy will call in like him and say there is no New World Order, there is no blah blah blah, just total denial.
[01:40:35.053 --> 01:40:35.793]  Total denial.
[01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:40.252]  I remember six, seven years ago saying the Supreme Court was following U.N.
[01:40:40.332 --> 01:40:42.353]  orders, because I had their rulings.
[01:40:43.894 --> 01:40:47.656]  Then, a year ago, the Supreme Court started announcing, we will follow the U.N.'
[01:40:47.636 --> 01:40:50.278]  's edicts, we will follow foreign courts' precedents.
[01:40:52.034 --> 01:40:53.795]  People said, oh my gosh, you were right.
[01:40:53.855 --> 01:40:55.875]  Yes, they were already doing it.
[01:40:55.975 --> 01:40:59.497]  They just wait to announce it until after it's in place.
[01:40:59.637 --> 01:41:02.898]  You already have national ID cards in 42 states.
[01:41:03.238 --> 01:41:04.398]  It's called your driver's license.
[01:41:04.438 --> 01:41:09.560]  It's federal specs, biometrics, federally controlled, federally regulated.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.220]  That's admitted.
[01:41:12.001 --> 01:41:15.842]  There's already face scanning cameras in every major city, but they haven't announced it.
[01:41:16.043 --> 01:41:17.203]  They're announcing it piecemeal.
[01:41:18.712 --> 01:41:20.653]  You see, folks, you're not aware of this stuff.
[01:41:20.934 --> 01:41:23.215]  And Jonathan, I don't know what I can say to you.
[01:41:23.235 --> 01:41:26.617]  We're going to go to Kim and Mark and Alan and Sean and others here in a minute.
[01:41:27.498 --> 01:41:30.940]  I want to bring up for five minutes my good buddy Jim Shepard, who I appreciate holding.
[01:41:31.921 --> 01:41:37.124]  Jim, did you hear that guy saying that our pilots weren't shot down in Vietnam and tortured?
[01:41:38.605 --> 01:41:39.265]  Yeah, I did.
[01:41:39.406 --> 01:41:41.207]  And I just think that, you know, there's a lot of
[01:41:42.328 --> 01:41:44.090]  It depends on where you're getting your information.
[01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:51.896]  You know, if you just pull up the nightly news and listen to the Ted Koppels of the world, you get this real pretty picture of the way things are and the way things ought to be.
[01:41:52.136 --> 01:42:04.106]  But, you know, if you dig in and you start looking a little bit below the surface, there's all kinds of information out there that, uh... But you don't have to dig beneath the surface to find out what happened in Vietnam.
[01:42:05.376 --> 01:42:15.980]  Well, I think that probably to the gentleman that called in, it's probably, you know, he's heard you and he hasn't heard that before, and he hasn't probably taken the time to actually look into the matter.
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:22.363]  It's just that, look, and probably his attitude is, look, Alex, you're saying something that I don't hear on the nightly news.
[01:42:22.483 --> 01:42:23.323]  It can't be true.
[01:42:24.684 --> 01:42:30.206]  And unfortunately, you know, if you're going to want wisdom, you've got to dig a little bit deeper than that.
[01:42:31.169 --> 01:42:38.172]  But, I mean, I would point out that Saddam tortured people, therefore Saddam's bad, which he is, but then we're torturing and suddenly good.
[01:42:39.133 --> 01:42:41.794]  That is double-think, that is double-speak.
[01:42:41.914 --> 01:42:49.257]  I'm very concerned about this acceptance, and to a large degree it's being accepted by American people that torture is good.
[01:42:49.817 --> 01:42:53.879]  And I think that the foundation for that kind of thinking is that
[01:42:55.861 --> 01:42:57.702]  Whatever the government does is good.
[01:42:58.162 --> 01:42:59.082]  It can't be bad.
[01:42:59.242 --> 01:43:03.284]  If you think that anything in the government is bad, then you must be subversive.
[01:43:03.725 --> 01:43:20.413]  But the reality is, Alex, I don't care if you look at doctors, politicians, you know, most of our politicians are lawyers, and it's kind of funny to me, people say, well, lawyers are bad, they're a bunch of sharks, but somehow, when they go into politics, all of a sudden they're good.
[01:43:20.493 --> 01:43:21.574]  I guess it's magic.
[01:43:21.714 --> 01:43:24.195]  And now that they're part of the government, they can do no wrong.
[01:43:24.833 --> 01:43:33.859]  And I think that's very fallacious thinking, and the reality is that it doesn't matter what profession you go into... You're going to find corrupt people, so you've got to have controls.
[01:43:33.879 --> 01:43:43.125]  You're going to find corrupt people, you're going to find good people, and if you allow torture and we get some corrupt people in government, buddy, you might be next.
[01:43:43.689 --> 01:43:45.010]  We can't open that door.
[01:43:45.050 --> 01:43:47.291]  That is a Pandora's box.
[01:43:47.391 --> 01:43:53.694]  And I'd say the same thing with respect to removing Americans' rights as citizens and calling them combatants.
[01:43:53.874 --> 01:44:03.018]  Well, why do you think the media every night in sitcoms, dramas, news, tortures good, tortures good on 24 and Threat Matrix, tortures good.
[01:44:03.278 --> 01:44:08.301]  It's so the police will watch that and have their social mores altered.
[01:44:09.955 --> 01:44:11.196]  We're in deep trouble, Jim.
[01:44:11.396 --> 01:44:15.459]  Well, I tell you, we're in deep trouble when we start saying that the ends justify the means.
[01:44:15.599 --> 01:44:26.207]  And one of the reasons why America has become such a success story in the history of government is because we have been a nation that is governed by rule of law.
[01:44:26.748 --> 01:44:28.549]  And once we remove that rule of law,
[01:44:29.981 --> 01:44:34.107]  The termites are in the building and it's not going to be long before the building comes down.
[01:44:34.187 --> 01:44:43.060]  And that's why we must defend the laws and not let them be eroded and decayed away with these vain philosophies.
[01:44:43.570 --> 01:44:45.711]  That are based on the ends justify the means.
[01:44:45.751 --> 01:44:47.032]  We cannot go down that road.
[01:44:47.072 --> 01:44:48.693]  Those are the doctrines of tyrants.
[01:44:48.833 --> 01:44:51.215]  And Jim, you've heard the national talk show host.
[01:44:51.695 --> 01:44:53.056]  You heard me a year ago say it.
[01:44:53.116 --> 01:44:55.298]  You can hardly believe it until you heard him say it himself.
[01:44:55.678 --> 01:44:57.819]  Every show put people in camps.
[01:44:57.899 --> 01:44:58.640]  They disagree.
[01:44:58.980 --> 01:44:59.981]  Torture is good.
[01:45:00.821 --> 01:45:02.983]  Arrest anyone that disagrees with the government.
[01:45:03.903 --> 01:45:06.565]  I mean, folks, this is not good.
[01:45:06.585 --> 01:45:09.487]  That's what Saddam Hussein did.
[01:45:10.966 --> 01:45:12.588]  And, you know, he had his arguments for it.
[01:45:13.108 --> 01:45:20.754]  Well, and I'll tell you something that else is very troubling to me, and I think it ought to trouble any red-blooded American.
[01:45:22.055 --> 01:45:27.179]  If there is a company in private business and they do something wrong, buddy, send them to jail.
[01:45:27.259 --> 01:45:30.421]  If the guy out in the street does something wrong, send them to jail.
[01:45:30.782 --> 01:45:38.828]  If somebody within the government does something wrong, then all of a sudden it becomes, well, let's investigate it and bury it in a thousand pages of documents,
[01:45:39.484 --> 01:45:44.486]  And stretch it out until the public no longer concerns, and when it goes away, let's give the guy a promotion.
[01:45:44.966 --> 01:45:50.287]  And unfortunately, that is the modus operandi that we are seeing across the board in government right now.
[01:45:50.387 --> 01:45:55.169]  They gave Lon Horyuchi a medal for blowing a woman's head off who had a baby in her arms.
[01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:58.470]  And so, see, these are troubling things.
[01:45:59.010 --> 01:46:04.872]  And the solicitor general, Clinton's solicitor general, in an 11th Circuit Court of Appeals case in 2007,
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.222]  If a citizen kills somebody in cold blood, it's bad.
[01:46:09.302 --> 01:46:10.843]  If a Fed does it, it's okay.
[01:46:11.184 --> 01:46:12.765]  We follow different rules.
[01:46:13.005 --> 01:46:14.907]  He actually said that.
[01:46:14.967 --> 01:46:18.169]  We cannot allow those precedents to be set.
[01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.911]  No, we can't.
[01:46:20.051 --> 01:46:31.961]  And you know, a number of years ago, during the Clinton administration, they came out with this ruling that it was an automatic death sentence if you fired upon a federal agent doing their work, whatever.
[01:46:32.481 --> 01:46:34.743]  And about that time, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area,
[01:46:35.593 --> 01:46:35.993]  I don't know.
[01:46:52.751 --> 01:47:00.419]  How does the person know the difference if we're not going to follow the rule of law and knock on the door and say we've got a warrant here to search the premises?
[01:47:00.439 --> 01:47:04.803]  Well, that's my point is that bad guys always wore black masks.
[01:47:04.923 --> 01:47:06.524]  Suddenly they say the good guy's wearing it.
[01:47:06.845 --> 01:47:08.486]  Jim, we've got about three, four minutes here.
[01:47:08.867 --> 01:47:15.633]  You've got some special Christmas stuff where you can super ship it out, cost a little more, with the big murky water filters.
[01:47:15.653 --> 01:47:16.274]  Tell them about it.
[01:47:17.655 --> 01:47:24.297]  Now, we have the other specials up, and you can still order those specials until the end of December, but they will not get there until Christmas.
[01:47:24.737 --> 01:47:27.678]  We have three specials that will get to you before Christmas.
[01:47:28.058 --> 01:47:32.700]  This is two-day shipping, and we will not charge you any additional shipping to do it in two days.
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:33.540]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:34.080]  Yes.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.462]  The first one is the Berkey Light with the large ceramic filters for $149.
[01:47:41.619 --> 01:47:47.600]  Uh, the second one is the Berkey Light with the purification elements in them, uh, without the lights.
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:47.920]  That's $1.99.
[01:47:49.541 --> 01:47:53.722]  And the third one is the Berkey Light with the lights for $2.59.
[01:47:54.262 --> 01:48:01.283]  And you can pick any one of those three, and we will ship them out blue-labeled to get them to you before Christmas, no additional charge.
[01:48:01.344 --> 01:48:03.384]  And so that's our pre-Christmas special, Alex.
[01:48:04.213 --> 01:48:09.718]  Wow, and it's a great deal to begin with, and I know that shipping's going to cost you a lot for what, two, three day shipping?
[01:48:09.758 --> 01:48:17.183]  Yeah, we're going to ship those out two day shipping, so they should arrive Wednesday, but we've got to get the orders in early today, so you need to call right now.
[01:48:17.203 --> 01:48:24.129]  If you call three o'clock this afternoon, then other arrangements will have to be made because UPS will have already come and picked up the shipment.
[01:48:24.952 --> 01:48:26.033]  They make great gifts.
[01:48:26.073 --> 01:48:27.633]  You've got a lot of different specials.
[01:48:27.853 --> 01:48:30.935]  Okay, so there's only three specials that you do this with.
[01:48:31.215 --> 01:48:31.975]  Give those out again.
[01:48:31.995 --> 01:48:37.518]  Okay, we can do the Berkey light with the ceramic filters for $149.
[01:48:38.078 --> 01:48:42.480]  We can do the Berkey light with the black Berkey purification elements for $199.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:48.863]  And we can do the Berkey light with the LED lights for $259.
[01:48:50.539 --> 01:48:53.042]  And there will be no additional charge to ship them out.
[01:48:53.202 --> 01:48:54.404]  Blue label to get them to you.
[01:48:54.444 --> 01:48:54.724]  All right.
[01:48:54.764 --> 01:48:56.066]  That's an amazing deal, folks.
[01:48:56.106 --> 01:48:57.347]  Take advantage of it right now.
[01:48:57.367 --> 01:48:58.629]  If you call, leave your name and number.
[01:48:58.689 --> 01:49:00.511]  They don't answer because they get a lot of calls.
[01:49:00.531 --> 01:49:00.591]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:49:06.698 --> 01:49:08.139]  888-803-4438.
[01:49:09.679 --> 01:49:12.420]  Two-day delivery, no additional charge.
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.841]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:49:16.842 --> 01:49:20.543]  And Jim, I'm glad that you're disgusted by all this stuff.
[01:49:20.583 --> 01:49:23.645]  I mean, Joseph Mengele was bad because he tortured the Nazi.
[01:49:24.185 --> 01:49:25.865]  But we're good if we torture.
[01:49:26.065 --> 01:49:27.406]  No, that is pure evil.
[01:49:27.686 --> 01:49:30.007]  That is the road to Hades, my friends.
[01:49:31.943 --> 01:49:35.866]  Alex, I couldn't agree with you more, and again, we cannot compromise these issues.
[01:49:36.266 --> 01:49:59.943]  These issues have carried us in good stead, made us the most powerful nation on Earth, and the concept or the thought that we're going to throw this out for a new ideology, that the ends justify the means, we're going to get rid of the citizens' rights, that your rights are dependent upon a bureaucrat in Washington and what he decides about you, without maybe even knowing who you are, any of your background, strip you of your rights, and be able to send you into some sort of detention camp,
[01:50:00.438 --> 01:50:01.000]  I don't think so.
[01:50:03.975 --> 01:50:05.856]  In order to do whatever they want to do.
[01:50:05.937 --> 01:50:07.998]  And all that's happening is absolutely un-American.
[01:50:08.118 --> 01:50:09.839]  That's in the Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[01:50:09.919 --> 01:50:10.820]  They passed 2.
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:12.781]  They're saying torture is good.
[01:50:12.861 --> 01:50:13.982]  It's all happening.
[01:50:14.422 --> 01:50:15.823]  It's all happening.
[01:50:16.263 --> 01:50:17.084]  It's so sick.
[01:50:17.144 --> 01:50:18.044]  Jim, thanks for coming on.
[01:50:18.505 --> 01:50:19.485]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[01:50:19.645 --> 01:50:20.346]  You bet, my friend.
[01:50:20.366 --> 01:50:21.166]  That's a great American.
[01:50:21.226 --> 01:50:23.128]  Great products made right here in the USA.
[01:50:23.688 --> 01:50:25.929]  And give them a call.
[01:50:25.949 --> 01:50:26.150]  888-803-4438.
[01:50:26.170 --> 01:50:31.113]  Alright, I would have already gotten to Kim and Mark and Alan and Sean and David and everybody else, but...
[01:50:32.407 --> 01:50:36.389]  I got off into a 10-minute argument with Jonathan.
[01:50:36.449 --> 01:50:43.531]  I mean, Jonathan, saying we didn't have jets shot down in Vietnam is like saying the sun didn't come up this morning.
[01:50:43.591 --> 01:50:45.552]  I don't have words to describe your ignorance.
[01:50:47.593 --> 01:50:48.413]  Unbelievable.
[01:50:48.633 --> 01:50:50.914]  But you think torture is okay, so, you know, there you go.
[01:50:53.945 --> 01:50:58.268]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.468 --> 01:51:02.871]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:03.031 --> 01:51:07.394]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:07.454 --> 01:51:08.775]  The New World Order.
[01:51:09.551 --> 01:51:09.871]  Pan-emerge.
[01:51:10.591 --> 01:51:14.792]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.852 --> 01:51:21.793]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.913 --> 01:51:23.954]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:24.314 --> 01:51:34.616]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.916 --> 01:51:37.056]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[01:51:37.256 --> 01:51:40.319]  Then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[01:51:45.204 --> 01:51:47.006]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:51:54.727 --> 01:51:59.230]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:51:59.570 --> 01:52:03.673]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:52:03.953 --> 01:52:04.513]  We listened.
[01:52:04.813 --> 01:52:09.797]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:52:10.077 --> 01:52:10.557]  We listened.
[01:52:10.957 --> 01:52:13.999]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:52:14.419 --> 01:52:14.960]  We listened.
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:18.422]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[01:52:19.833 --> 01:52:20.334]  We listened.
[01:52:20.674 --> 01:52:25.918]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:52:26.338 --> 01:52:27.699]  Again, we listened.
[01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:35.446]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:52:35.826 --> 01:52:40.250]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at

[01:52:51.573 --> 01:52:53.314]  Oh my!
[01:52:54.434 --> 01:52:59.136]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:52:59.296 --> 01:52:59.937]  Yes, it's true.
[01:52:59.957 --> 01:53:02.678]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:53:02.798 --> 01:53:06.800]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:07.460]  You heard it right.
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:12.582]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:53:12.683 --> 01:53:13.683]  The list goes on and on.
[01:53:13.963 --> 01:53:18.009]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[01:53:18.089 --> 01:53:20.212]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[01:53:20.412 --> 01:53:21.614]  This is a limited time offer.
[01:53:21.714 --> 01:53:25.980]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:27.962]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.

[01:54:01.419 --> 01:54:03.781]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:05.522 --> 01:54:12.327]  I knew that that caller earlier would spur massive phone calls saying that we didn't lose any jets in Vietnam.
[01:54:13.528 --> 01:54:16.290]  And we're about to go to Kim and Mark and Alan and Sean.
[01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:20.894]  We got Ron Paul coming up and I'm gonna hold him back a little bit just to get to these.

[01:55:22.305 --> 01:55:42.720]  Pastor Butch Pawes, a decorated Vietnam veteran, host on this network, he brought in, you know, saw the dead bodies from the jet pilots and the other pilots, and then we'll go to Kim and Mark and Alan and Sean, but Pastor Butch, you called in because you heard that Jonathan character saying, none of our people got shot down in Vietnam, but torture's good.
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:43.241]  Go ahead.
[01:55:43.621 --> 01:55:48.685]  Well, Alex, I read something called in your program, because you got the callers backed out forever, but I had to share this.
[01:55:49.449 --> 01:55:54.812]  Uh, Jonathan scared me more than any standing army could because a man of ignorance is a dangerous citizen.
[01:55:55.633 --> 01:55:57.594]  Uh, he's dangerous not only to himself, but the whole country.
[01:55:58.054 --> 01:56:03.917]  I was in Vietnam, and I don't mind telling Jonathan this, I was also in Laos, which was totally illegal in 1969.
[01:56:03.977 --> 01:56:05.518]  We were not supposed to be there.
[01:56:06.038 --> 01:56:10.981]  I was in Laos, I was in communications, I saw the dead bodies brought in, I saw the plane wreckage brought in.
[01:56:11.001 --> 01:56:15.864]  Uh, I don't know where Jonathan's coming from, but Jonathan, I am 55 years old, a Vietnam veteran.
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:28.824]  I saw these things with my own eyes, and I don't know where you got your history from, but my friend, you have been lied to, and you need to pay attention to the truth and quit believing these talking heads on TV, because they're going to destroy you and your land.
[01:56:28.984 --> 01:56:32.326]  Pastor, we had as high a rate as in the worst parts of World War II.
[01:56:32.686 --> 01:56:37.327]  They would send out a dozen jets, and many times six or seven would come back.
[01:56:37.627 --> 01:56:38.528]  I know we lost over 2,000
[01:56:39.808 --> 01:56:42.170]  pilots of a fixed-wing aircraft.
[01:56:42.410 --> 01:56:44.712]  We lost thousands and thousands of helicopter pilots.
[01:56:44.952 --> 01:56:46.874]  My uncle was shot down multiple times.
[01:56:47.194 --> 01:56:49.116]  This guy calls in and says it didn't happen.
[01:56:49.977 --> 01:56:59.484]  Alex, my job in the military, I was in communication, my job was Morse code tracking our jets flying the missions.
[01:56:59.845 --> 01:57:04.048]  And they got very upset if I lost the jet with the signal going across.
[01:57:04.288 --> 01:57:05.229]  Don't tell me they weren't there.
[01:57:05.329 --> 01:57:05.950]  I tracked them.
[01:57:06.330 --> 01:57:07.371]  I know they were there because
[01:57:09.073 --> 01:57:15.542]  I'm the one who sent the grids out there to keep them on satellite and on radar.
[01:57:17.023 --> 01:57:17.563]  I know they were there.
[01:57:17.583 --> 01:57:18.104]  I tracked them.
[01:57:18.544 --> 01:57:24.306]  Well, everybody knows they got him and tortured the living daylights out of him, and then he... I don't know what he's talking about.
[01:57:24.466 --> 01:57:34.571]  Well, I don't either, Alex, but he's a product of the Dumbed Down Society of America, the ones who watch ABC and the rest of the communist broadcasting stations, CNN, all of them.
[01:57:34.591 --> 01:57:35.851]  We've got one minute left, Pastor.
[01:57:35.871 --> 01:57:37.532]  Okay, well, I'll come back and take calls.
[01:57:37.812 --> 01:57:39.573]  Okay, Jonathan, take care.
[01:57:39.713 --> 01:57:40.073]  Now, hold on.
[01:57:40.093 --> 01:57:42.354]  I want you to tell me, why is torture bad?
[01:57:43.988 --> 01:57:49.731]  Torture is bad because it's immoral, unscriptural, ungodly, and it's never been done in this country before that I know of.
[01:57:49.751 --> 01:57:55.194]  I probably have it behind the scenes, but if we legalize it and make it right, our nation is all but gone now, Alex.
[01:57:56.134 --> 01:57:59.396]  One more step like that and judgment will come on this country like you're not going to believe.
[01:58:01.297 --> 01:58:03.678]  And the Vietnamese did torture our people.
[01:58:03.698 --> 01:58:11.902]  Yes, they did torture our people, and as a fact, and I can tell you, I can give them names of prisoners of war, and you mentioned one, McCain, supposedly tortured, who would tell him, yes, they were tortured.
[01:58:13.442 --> 01:58:14.883]  But not according to this guy.
[01:58:14.903 --> 01:58:18.324]  Yeah, the poor boy getting his eyes opened before it's too late.
[01:58:18.764 --> 01:58:19.924]  Alex, thanks a lot for bringing me on.
[01:58:20.304 --> 01:58:20.824]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:58:20.884 --> 01:58:23.565]  I'm gonna come back and get your calls in, Ron Paul.
[01:58:24.486 --> 01:58:25.446]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:58:25.486 --> 01:58:26.046]  Third hour.
[01:58:26.706 --> 01:58:28.127]  That's what I'm fighting against, though.
[01:58:28.427 --> 01:58:37.910]  I mean, people that don't know how many continents there are, what the First Amendment is, where Iraq is, what the three branches of government are, they don't know anything.
[01:58:38.770 --> 01:58:40.511]  But they are for torture, though.
[01:58:40.531 --> 01:58:41.151]  Oh, yeah.
[01:58:44.272 --> 01:58:47.755]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:58:48.015 --> 01:58:51.518]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:58:51.598 --> 01:58:55.541]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:58:55.761 --> 01:59:01.926]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:02.346 --> 01:59:10.252]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:59:10.672 --> 01:59:16.016]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:59:16.156 --> 01:59:19.938]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:59:20.299 --> 01:59:22.180]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:24.382]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:59:24.622 --> 01:59:28.965]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:59:29.025 --> 01:59:35.329]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:59:38.551 --> 01:59:42.374]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:51.420]  Big Brother.
[01:59:52.081 --> 01:59:53.142]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.842 --> 01:59:55.003]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.603 --> 01:59:56.464]  You want answers?
[01:59:57.185 --> 01:59:58.145]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.766 --> 02:00:02.589]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.929 --> 02:00:06.992]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.326 --> 02:00:13.148]  Alright folks, we've got Congresswoman Ron Paul coming up, who was an Air Force flight surgeon.
[02:00:13.208 --> 02:00:18.490]  He can tell you all about how many of our troops got shot down over Vietnam.
[02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:26.874]  We had a caller earlier denying that anyone was ever shot down over Vietnam and how torture is good, but now the whole show is going to descend into arguing about this.
[02:00:28.254 --> 02:00:29.195]  Let's go to calls.
[02:00:29.315 --> 02:00:30.215]  Kim in Texas.
[02:00:30.275 --> 02:00:31.116]  Kim, you're on the air.
[02:00:31.176 --> 02:00:31.616]  Go ahead.
[02:00:31.636 --> 02:00:34.957]  Hi, I wanted to know something about Lyndon LaRouche.
[02:00:36.198 --> 02:00:36.438]  Yes.
[02:00:37.419 --> 02:00:38.439]  What do you know about him?
[02:00:39.079 --> 02:00:43.140]  He puts out a lot of good information about the New World Order, but his solutions are wrong.
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:44.680]  Basically, socialism.
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:46.761]  Okay.
[02:00:46.861 --> 02:00:54.522]  And he's promoting the alternative New World Order system run by the communists, basically.
[02:00:54.542 --> 02:01:04.864]  He has a lot of good info, a lot of good members, a great newspaper, intelligence review, executive intelligence review, but on key issues, it's disinfo.
[02:01:06.124 --> 02:01:06.544]  Okay.
[02:01:07.028 --> 02:01:11.670]  And also, no one gave credit to Malcolm X when he talked about Kennedy being assassinated.
[02:01:13.071 --> 02:01:14.392]  He said our government did it.
[02:01:14.632 --> 02:01:17.653]  And now 92% of Americans believe the government killed Kennedy.
[02:01:18.053 --> 02:01:18.714]  Exactly.
[02:01:19.234 --> 02:01:19.874]  Exactly.
[02:01:20.475 --> 02:01:24.397]  But also, I wonder, do you ever listen to 88.7 here in Austin?
[02:01:26.458 --> 02:01:27.218]  Sometimes, yes.
[02:01:28.279 --> 02:01:30.860]  I know they won't answer any questions when it comes to government issues.
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:33.301]  You can't talk about those topics on this station.
[02:01:33.661 --> 02:01:34.982]  And it's a non-profit station.
[02:01:36.027 --> 02:01:43.791]  Yeah, it's the local predominantly black station and I've noticed they don't really allow a lot of First Amendment stuff.
[02:01:44.351 --> 02:01:46.072]  Right.
[02:01:46.192 --> 02:01:49.454]  Can I come to your office and pick up the tape or do I have to order them?
[02:01:50.414 --> 02:01:56.337]  Yeah, you know, I've got an office where I take mail and I've got my physical office and it would just turn into a circus.
[02:01:57.418 --> 02:02:03.941]  But you can go to the Hardware Store Incorporated at Spicewood Springs Road 183 in North Austin and they sell the videos.
[02:02:04.893 --> 02:02:05.193]  Okay.
[02:02:05.433 --> 02:02:06.714]  Thank you, Tim.
[02:02:06.754 --> 02:02:07.674]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:07.734 --> 02:02:08.374]  Great points.
[02:02:09.495 --> 02:02:17.037]  Let's talk to... Let's go to Walt, then we'll go to Shawn and Steve and John and everybody else.
[02:02:17.177 --> 02:02:18.537]  Walt in Kansas City, go ahead.
[02:02:18.778 --> 02:02:19.958]  Well, God bless you, Alex.
[02:02:21.038 --> 02:02:23.599]  I heard this guy on there, and boy, I'll tell you what.
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:32.402]  For him, for he that doesn't think that a lot of our guys got shot down or that we just didn't blow anything up over there,
[02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:40.267]  He was correct in the fact that there were no fly no attack zones and that's what infuriated me is
[02:02:41.403 --> 02:02:46.044]  A lot of the no-fly, no-attack zones were their tank farms.
[02:02:46.124 --> 02:02:50.445]  Not tanks as in army tanks, but in fuel tanks.
[02:02:50.625 --> 02:02:52.345]  We weren't to bomb those.
[02:02:52.405 --> 02:02:57.366]  Well, he was saying that we didn't lose any pilots or that they weren't tortured in Vietnam.
[02:02:57.766 --> 02:03:01.327]  Yeah, well, everybody was tortured over there that was captured.
[02:03:01.347 --> 02:03:02.847]  You can bet your bippy on that.
[02:03:03.247 --> 02:03:04.868]  And we did lose a lot of pilots.
[02:03:07.472 --> 02:03:13.534]  I know at least three or four off of the USS Coral Sea when I was flying over there.
[02:03:14.254 --> 02:03:20.656]  And we would come in many times as low as 300 feet and eliminate anything that we could find to eliminate.
[02:03:20.696 --> 02:03:21.817]  That was part of the orders.
[02:03:22.837 --> 02:03:27.378]  And I didn't know that Brother Butch was one of them that charted the planes.
[02:03:27.438 --> 02:03:28.499]  That's pretty interesting.
[02:03:28.519 --> 02:03:30.899]  Yeah.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:35.941]  But think of the level of denial to say our troops weren't tortured in Vietnam.
[02:03:36.576 --> 02:03:37.176]  Well, yeah.
[02:03:37.477 --> 02:03:45.922]  I mean, you know, anytime our troops get captured, you can bet whoever captures them is not going to treat them as fairly as the United States always did.
[02:03:46.222 --> 02:03:47.723]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:03:48.023 --> 02:03:48.863]  I appreciate that.
[02:03:49.264 --> 02:03:50.705]  Sean in Colorado, go ahead.
[02:03:52.125 --> 02:03:52.926]  Good to talk to you.
[02:03:53.386 --> 02:03:54.467]  Good to talk to you, Alex.
[02:03:54.527 --> 02:04:04.413]  This morning I was listening to a religious show before you here on 1360 in Colorado, and it's a rabbi.
[02:04:05.289 --> 02:04:22.554]  Um, Mr. Spivak, and he was so adamant about torturing Saddam, um, that it spurred me to call him up and ask him why he's torturing Saddam if Saddam knows of a bomb that's going to kill, you know, a hundred U.S.
[02:04:22.654 --> 02:04:27.996]  soldiers, and then he won't even address the fact that, you know... Hey, I'll tell you what, we got a lot of callers.
[02:04:28.036 --> 02:04:29.536]  I'll get to all of you after Ron Paul.
[02:04:29.556 --> 02:04:30.816]  He'll only be on a few segments.
[02:04:31.137 --> 02:04:31.837]  We're honored to have him.
[02:04:31.877 --> 02:04:32.497]  He's coming up.
[02:04:33.112 --> 02:04:36.537]  We'll get back into this whole torture discussion, because it is very important.
[02:04:37.398 --> 02:04:40.743]  And, uh, we'll, uh, discuss when we return.
[02:04:41.183 --> 02:04:42.966]  So please stay with us, everybody.
[02:04:47.252 --> 02:04:50.136]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:04:50.834 --> 02:04:52.135]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:04:52.335 --> 02:04:58.078]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:04:58.358 --> 02:05:03.601]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.

[02:05:08.203 --> 02:05:12.027]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:05:12.267 --> 02:05:16.911]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:05:16.991 --> 02:05:23.257]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:05:23.297 --> 02:05:25.139]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:55.513]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:06:55.813 --> 02:06:56.374]  We listened.
[02:06:56.674 --> 02:07:01.657]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:07:01.937 --> 02:07:02.418]  We listened.
[02:07:02.798 --> 02:07:05.840]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:06.801]  We listened.
[02:07:07.261 --> 02:07:09.923]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping.
[02:07:11.203 --> 02:07:11.343]  Yes.
[02:07:11.683 --> 02:07:12.184]  We listened.
[02:07:12.524 --> 02:07:17.767]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:07:18.187 --> 02:07:19.548]  Again, we listened.
[02:07:19.908 --> 02:07:27.292]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[02:07:50.871 --> 02:07:51.531]  Big Brother.
[02:07:52.192 --> 02:07:53.232]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:53.953 --> 02:07:55.073]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:55.714 --> 02:07:56.534]  You want answers?
[02:07:57.295 --> 02:07:58.215]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:58.856 --> 02:08:02.598]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:03.038 --> 02:08:05.380]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:08:06.275 --> 02:08:07.135]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.039 --> 02:08:17.220]  All right, my friends.
[02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:23.582]  Already 8 minutes and 35 seconds into the third hour of this December 22nd, 2003 Monday edition.
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:28.080]  And I've had Ron Paul on this show many times.
[02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:31.621]  We're going to have him for the next two segments, maybe even get to a few calls in the next segment.
[02:08:32.022 --> 02:08:34.522]  I've got a host of issues I want to throw out at the Congressman.
[02:08:35.022 --> 02:08:41.684]  But Congressman Ron Paul, before we go any further, I had a caller last hour that caused quite a controversy here on air.
[02:08:42.104 --> 02:08:44.925]  He said that he thought torture was basically a good idea.
[02:08:45.505 --> 02:08:49.086]  And then I said, well, what about our troops that got shot down in Vietnam?
[02:08:49.126 --> 02:08:49.887]  They got tortured.
[02:08:50.187 --> 02:08:51.347]  Are you saying that was OK?
[02:08:51.647 --> 02:08:55.429]  He then said, no, none of our troops got shot down over Vietnam.
[02:08:56.109 --> 02:09:00.671]  I'm going from memory here, but weren't you involved in Vietnam in the air?
[02:09:01.451 --> 02:09:02.392]  No, not really.
[02:09:02.532 --> 02:09:04.752]  I was involved during that period of time.
[02:09:04.792 --> 02:09:05.833]  I was in the military.
[02:09:05.853 --> 02:09:09.234]  I was in the Air Force as a flight surgeon from 1963 to 1968, but not actually in Vietnam.
[02:09:09.254 --> 02:09:09.294]  OK.
[02:09:14.543 --> 02:09:20.144]  I know that we had a bunch of aircraft shot down and troops tortured, but can you give us your historical view on that?
[02:09:20.604 --> 02:09:24.825]  Well, I mean, that doesn't even deceive... I mean, I can't understand anybody saying that.
[02:09:25.206 --> 02:09:35.528]  We probably had a lot more helicopters shot down than airplanes, and the people in the helicopters were the ones that ended up being prisoners so often, but there were hundreds of helicopters shot down.
[02:09:36.775 --> 02:09:41.217]  And I'm sure other airplanes were shot down, too, but it was mainly the helicopters that were knocked out of the air.
[02:09:41.257 --> 02:09:43.658]  Yeah, how could that guy be deceived by that, as you were saying?
[02:09:43.698 --> 02:09:46.820]  But, no, he was saying that our jets didn't get shot down.
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:48.861]  We lost masses of pilots.
[02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:50.741]  Remember John McCain and all those people?
[02:09:51.042 --> 02:09:55.844]  Yeah, and Duke Cunningham, also in Congress, was, you know, I think he was captured.
[02:09:55.884 --> 02:10:02.507]  And Johnson, Sam Johnson from Texas, was also a pilot that, yeah, and he was not a helicopter pilot, either.
[02:10:02.647 --> 02:10:04.287]  And McCain was not a helicopter pilot.
[02:10:04.307 --> 02:10:05.608]  So there were a lot of planes shot down.
[02:10:06.095 --> 02:10:13.301]  I don't know the numbers, but we ended up losing 60,000 men, so they had to shoot a lot of them down.
[02:10:13.401 --> 02:10:22.328]  I'm going from memory, I believe it's over 2,000 fixed-wing aircraft were shot down, and helicopters were shot down, I believe it was over 8,000 times.
[02:10:23.489 --> 02:10:30.295]  Now, many times it was just technical difficulties or they had to land, but I didn't mean to get off on that side issue, I was just so blown away by that statement.
[02:10:31.201 --> 02:10:32.683]  No, I didn't see that, but I guess I'm not surprised.
[02:10:32.703 --> 02:10:35.286]  A lot of them can't even name who the Vice President is.
[02:10:50.882 --> 02:10:51.422]  Unbelievable.
[02:10:51.762 --> 02:10:55.823]  You were down at the Jefferson Forum, and I got a bunch of calls out of Houston.
[02:10:55.863 --> 02:10:59.344]  You were saying that it looks like they're lining up the draft now.
[02:10:59.424 --> 02:11:03.985]  Rumsfeld in Time Magazine just said, yeah, we need a bigger military.
[02:11:04.025 --> 02:11:06.966]  They've got a bunch of legislation lined up to do it.
[02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:08.706]  What do you see happening, Congressman?
[02:11:09.006 --> 02:11:17.388]  Well, I hear a lot of talk behind the scenes, but there's been legislation introduced, some by moderate liberal Democrats, as well as the Black Caucus.
[02:11:17.947 --> 02:11:22.553]  And there are all sorts of arguments to increase the size of our military.
[02:11:23.534 --> 02:11:36.990]  Rumsfeld, who's always argued for a small military, he's never argued to slow down on the intervention overseas, but he's always argued that we don't need a lot of men just highly skilled, but now he's admitting
[02:11:37.352 --> 02:11:38.172]  Thank you for your time.
[02:11:57.196 --> 02:12:13.503]  Well, I mean, I've read the Houston Chronicle where it says they've got a bill to draft skilled people, professionals, doctors, engineers, firefighters, and some of these national drafts look like you'll serve domestically, some will serve overseas.
[02:12:14.163 --> 02:12:16.144]  What do the different pieces of legislation say?
[02:12:16.944 --> 02:12:22.747]  I haven't looked at them all, but that sort of follows a historic precedent, especially for physicians.
[02:12:23.351 --> 02:12:32.518]  Even when they ended the draft in the early 70s, they kept the doctor draft going on for a while longer, and they have already talked about drafting doctors.
[02:12:32.758 --> 02:12:42.125]  There's a pseudo-draft on right now as well, because those individuals who have been scheduled to get out of the military and have not reenlisted,
[02:12:43.638 --> 02:12:48.983]  Yeah, and I guess they do sign some of that paperwork where they'll claim that they have agreed to do that.
[02:13:06.025 --> 02:13:08.966]  And it's not a very good sign.
[02:13:09.006 --> 02:13:10.467]  Okay, well I hate to put you on the spot.
[02:13:10.507 --> 02:13:13.388]  I don't ever really do this when you're on with us, but you've got some children.
[02:13:13.409 --> 02:13:15.069]  What are you going to do when they try to draft your children?
[02:13:15.930 --> 02:13:19.471]  Well, they're all going to be old enough to make their own choices.
[02:13:19.531 --> 02:13:21.472]  My kids are all past that age.
[02:13:21.512 --> 02:13:24.634]  I have grandkids that age, and it'll be up to them.
[02:13:24.714 --> 02:13:29.576]  The individual himself has to decide that, but to me it's a real tragedy.
[02:13:29.596 --> 02:13:33.578]  I think that, you know, the use of the
[02:13:34.817 --> 02:13:42.680]  Conscientious Objector Clause, it was used more in Vietnam than ever before, and I'm sure it's going to be used a lot more later on.
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:44.300]  Well, let's take Texas.
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:50.082]  You know, if Texas was attacked by Mexico, they said, we're grafting men for a war with Mexico, that would be constitutional.
[02:13:50.362 --> 02:13:52.183]  We're under attack by a foreign government.
[02:13:52.463 --> 02:13:56.445]  I would imagine you would support a draft there, but not to go gallivanting around 160 countries.
[02:13:57.945 --> 02:14:03.749]  No, I wouldn't go that far, either, because I don't think we should ever have a draft.
[02:14:04.129 --> 02:14:07.651]  But I always believed that if we were attacked, that we would respond.
[02:14:07.691 --> 02:14:12.294]  We didn't have a draft in the Revolutionary War, and we won it against the greatest in power at that time.
[02:14:12.474 --> 02:14:15.256]  So if it's a righteous war, we're going to have more men than we need.
[02:14:15.356 --> 02:14:15.796]  Right.
[02:14:16.377 --> 02:14:20.059]  And the real defense of a country comes by civilians armed.
[02:14:20.623 --> 02:14:30.773]  And that's why the Second Amendment is so important, and the militia, the concept of the militia, people who are readily armed, and then there will be no takeover.
[02:14:31.774 --> 02:14:40.202]  So I just don't think you ever have to have a draft, because what you concede with a draft is ownership of one's life, and that means the politicians own your life.
[02:14:40.689 --> 02:14:50.051]  And you can unfairly pick a certain group and force them into battle, especially under today's conditions, into a battle that makes no sense and is unconstitutional.
[02:14:50.091 --> 02:14:52.151]  We may be fighting it for the United Nations.
[02:14:52.371 --> 02:14:54.672]  So it is more atrocious now than ever.
[02:14:55.012 --> 02:14:56.272]  Let's shift gears into torture.
[02:14:56.292 --> 02:14:58.753]  There's a big debate about, is torture good?
[02:14:58.813 --> 02:14:59.493]  Should we do it?
[02:14:59.513 --> 02:15:00.953]  We know it's already going on some.
[02:15:02.274 --> 02:15:03.374]  Your view on torture?
[02:15:03.774 --> 02:15:06.214]  Well, there's two practical reasons not to.
[02:15:06.314 --> 02:15:08.915]  If we torture them, they'll torture us.
[02:15:09.568 --> 02:15:17.373]  And the other thing is what torture does not to the person who may well deserve it as much as the people who dish it out.
[02:15:17.753 --> 02:15:23.497]  So if a country who pretends to follow the rule of law and justice
[02:15:24.093 --> 02:15:24.433]  I don't know.
[02:15:45.726 --> 02:15:50.549]  And it's not reliable, so there's just no excuse for the use of torture.
[02:15:50.569 --> 02:15:53.391]  Plus, Congressman, you can't trust a government that tortures.
[02:15:53.691 --> 02:15:55.112]  You can't trust the confessions.
[02:15:55.552 --> 02:15:57.733]  I mean, you can't say Joseph Mengele was good.
[02:15:58.233 --> 02:16:00.455]  So how can, you know, Saddam's back as he tortured.
[02:16:00.495 --> 02:16:03.276]  Now we're going to become Saddam Hussein if we do this.
[02:16:03.857 --> 02:16:04.997]  Shifting into immigration.
[02:16:05.337 --> 02:16:14.883]  Governor Ridge, while raising the alert level, wants to give amnesty to at least 8 million illegals, accept the matricula cards all over the country that can easily be faked.
[02:16:15.543 --> 02:16:21.046]  How can they have a magnifying glass down our throat, but then have the borders basically wide open?
[02:16:21.086 --> 02:16:22.226]  Your take on that?
[02:16:23.026 --> 02:16:24.767]  Well, that's essentially what they're doing.
[02:16:24.787 --> 02:16:34.411]  You know, the other day, a couple weeks ago, we had a bill that was threatening Syria, almost to the point where, you know, we put on sanctions and we were getting ready to invade Syria.
[02:16:35.151 --> 02:16:39.693]  And they said the main reason was the borders weren't secure.
[02:16:40.074 --> 02:16:41.054]  And my argument was,
[02:16:41.587 --> 02:16:45.744]  Well, how can you expect the Syrians to have secure borders between their country and Iraq?
[02:16:46.539 --> 02:16:52.122]  At the same time, we don't have anything called secure borders, so the whole thing is complete nonsense.
[02:16:52.142 --> 02:16:58.826]  And that's why our money and our personnel should be used domestically, not internationally.
[02:16:58.906 --> 02:17:00.967]  That means we should have more secure borders.
[02:17:01.007 --> 02:17:01.608]  Well, I agree.
[02:17:02.028 --> 02:17:14.595]  How can we say that Saddam is this great demon when he is a bad guy, but then Bush cuts Taiwan loose and violates basically the treaty and changes our 50-plus year policy with Taiwan?
[02:17:15.015 --> 02:17:19.377]  Well, whatever is practical, they do, and if they want to go with the big red Chinese, they do.
[02:17:21.078 --> 02:17:37.047]  They don't follow moral principles, they follow just pure financial pragmatism, because we were close allies with Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden in the past, we helped build them up, and when they don't serve our purpose, then we turn them into Hitler themselves, and we did that with
[02:17:37.506 --> 02:17:37.666]  I don't
[02:18:00.602 --> 02:18:05.225]  Not really so, and then I pointed out George Washington said it, and they said, yeah, but that was a long time ago.
[02:18:05.666 --> 02:18:16.213]  I said, does that mean our Bill of Rights is no longer necessary because it's a long time ago, or the Ten Commandments no longer do we have to abide by because they were written a long time ago?
[02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:19.351]  Because conditions are different today.
[02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:23.332]  Anything our founding fathers said or intended by the Constitution no longer applies.
[02:18:23.592 --> 02:18:27.454]  Well, what the founders, as you know well, were saying was something new.
[02:18:27.714 --> 02:18:29.495]  We're going back to the imperial model.
[02:18:29.695 --> 02:18:31.336]  We're going back to something older, aren't we?
[02:18:31.776 --> 02:18:32.336]  That's right.
[02:18:32.496 --> 02:18:40.580]  And I think freedom, although we had a hint and a taste of that in our early years, freedom is a very, very modern idea.
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:46.322]  Most of all, history has been built on tyrants and government control and very, very
[02:18:46.941 --> 02:18:47.562]  I think so.
[02:18:59.252 --> 02:19:03.014]  And we believe in the future, they do want to go back to the old ways.
[02:19:03.474 --> 02:19:13.340]  That's it, we're going to break, maybe go to a few calls, but I want to get into the plunging dollar, the $43 trillion deficit according to the Dallas Morning News.
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:20.084]  That's right folks, that's what we really owe in all of our agreements, $40 trillion plus.
[02:19:20.524 --> 02:19:23.446]  Get those questions answered by Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:19:24.246 --> 02:19:26.927]  And maybe jam a few of these calls in.
[02:19:26.947 --> 02:19:27.687]  We got loaded lines.
[02:19:27.707 --> 02:19:29.228]  I want to find out who wants to talk to the Congressman.
[02:19:29.628 --> 02:19:35.210]  Then after that segment, we'll come back and just talk to the callers and go back over some news I haven't covered yet.
[02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:38.091]  We'll be back with Congressman Ron Paul from Texas.
[02:19:38.591 --> 02:19:39.471]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:20:47.455 --> 02:20:47.975]  Late summer 2003.
[02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:52.470]  Mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:54.070]  Late summer 2002?
[02:20:54.610 --> 02:20:55.610]  I heard the same thing.
[02:20:56.050 --> 02:20:57.491]  Late summer 2001?
[02:20:57.831 --> 02:20:58.931]  You heard the same thing.
[02:20:59.311 --> 02:21:06.432]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[02:21:06.953 --> 02:21:07.833]  That's recovery?
[02:21:08.453 --> 02:21:13.654]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.

[02:21:31.516 --> 02:21:36.102]  Learn how to protect your assets with real wealth, not potentially worthless paper.
[02:21:36.462 --> 02:21:37.303]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[02:21:37.343 --> 02:21:37.523]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:45.533 --> 02:21:50.735]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:21:50.895 --> 02:21:58.979]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:21:59.239 --> 02:22:06.282]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:22:06.482 --> 02:22:06.762]  I think?
[02:22:25.936 --> 02:22:27.037]  We're good to go.
[02:22:47.324 --> 02:22:52.829]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:22:53.249 --> 02:22:57.473]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:22:57.713 --> 02:23:04.740]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:23:05.140 --> 02:23:11.246]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:23:11.386 --> 02:23:12.587]  There are no side effects.
[02:23:12.927 --> 02:23:15.869]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:23:16.029 --> 02:23:18.050]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:23:18.371 --> 02:23:25.615]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:23:25.895 --> 02:23:29.338]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:23:29.718 --> 02:23:32.920]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-8000.
[02:23:36.024 --> 02:23:39.145]  6625.
[02:23:36.044 --> 02:23:39.145]  866-885-6625.
[02:23:39.786 --> 02:23:43.328]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:23:43.388 --> 02:23:44.048]  Call today.
[02:23:53.193 --> 02:23:59.377]  Alright my friends, Alex Jones back here live with Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:23:59.417 --> 02:24:01.518]  Try to go through your calls here in a couple minutes.
[02:24:02.675 --> 02:24:07.280]  Congressman, getting back into important issues, dollar drop becomes more ominous.
[02:24:08.681 --> 02:24:17.409]  We have the Euro trading at $1.25 when it was 90 cents against the dollar just a year and a half ago.
[02:24:18.370 --> 02:24:23.655]  And what does this mean to us to have the World Reserve currency and to now be losing it?
[02:24:25.016 --> 02:24:26.698]  Well, it means a whole lot.
[02:24:28.393 --> 02:24:32.614]  They're still buying our currencies, and the central banks are still trying to profit up.
[02:24:33.274 --> 02:24:42.457]  But if they get to the point where they really leave the dollar, and oil is not priced in dollars, you're going to see tremendous price inflation.
[02:24:42.477 --> 02:24:48.539]  You're going to see us paying a lot more for oil and everything we buy overseas, as well as domestic inflation.
[02:24:48.599 --> 02:24:56.441]  So, I think they're working desperately behind the scenes to keep the dollar from just dropping like a rock, although it's dropped dramatically already.
[02:24:57.345 --> 02:24:57.986]  I don't know.
[02:25:05.686 --> 02:25:14.292]  The dollar will go down, which means commodity prices, which are already on the rise, as well as gold, they'll continue to go up, and inflation will be back with a vengeance.
[02:25:14.692 --> 02:25:17.955]  Well, the globalists have already moved most of their holdings to China and India.
[02:25:18.295 --> 02:25:21.337]  They've got Treasury Secretary Snowe saying a dropping dollar's good.
[02:25:21.757 --> 02:25:23.479]  I don't really see him doing much to prop it up.
[02:25:23.519 --> 02:25:28.902]  Seems like the bigger, overriding global corporate system wants a weak dollar.
[02:25:28.922 --> 02:25:32.505]  I saw the Davos Economic Forum three and a half years ago saying that.
[02:25:32.865 --> 02:25:44.535]  Yeah, you know, the exporters keep thinking a weak dollar is going to save them, but it never seems to happen, and members of Congress who represent steel districts and farm districts think that's just the salvation.
[02:25:44.575 --> 02:25:52.562]  Just have a weaker dollar, and then there'll be generous exports, which means they don't care about consumers, and they don't care about importers.
[02:25:52.602 --> 02:25:55.964]  I mean, a lot of companies depend on imported goods.
[02:25:56.305 --> 02:25:58.967]  This whole notion that government should be manipulating
[02:25:59.395 --> 02:26:07.281]  In controlling the value of the currency, the market should determine it, but it should be determined by a commodity, of course, rather than a fiat currency.
[02:26:07.301 --> 02:26:08.662]  I said I was going to go to calls.
[02:26:08.822 --> 02:26:12.305]  I don't know if that can happen now, because I forgot the biggest question I had for you.
[02:26:12.685 --> 02:26:15.527]  You said before H.R.
[02:26:16.047 --> 02:26:19.170]  2417 passed, you said that it had a lot of Patriot Act II in it.
[02:26:19.290 --> 02:26:23.893]  Bush sneakily signed that quietly last weekend during the whole Saddam announcement.
[02:26:24.194 --> 02:26:24.894]  What does this mean?
[02:26:25.595 --> 02:26:28.637]  Well, this was the conference report.
[02:26:29.224 --> 02:26:36.688]  On intelligence authorization, and they've been talking about Patriot Number Two, but they decided not to bring it up, calling it Patriot Number Two.
[02:26:37.168 --> 02:26:43.992]  So they started doing piecemeal, and they put a major piece into this conference report, and it had not been discussed before.
[02:26:44.493 --> 02:26:49.956]  And it has to do with more intrusion into the financial affairs of every American.
[02:26:50.396 --> 02:26:52.197]  That they do not have to have search warrants.
[02:26:53.081 --> 02:26:59.303]  And they can demand information from auto dealers and travel agents, pawnbrokers, anybody and everybody.
[02:26:59.563 --> 02:27:04.585]  And now we're hearing about them going after topless bars, county commissioners, marijuana dealers.
[02:27:04.805 --> 02:27:06.066]  They're using Patriot Act.
[02:27:06.126 --> 02:27:08.246]  I have articles every week against everybody.
[02:27:08.887 --> 02:27:18.270]  That is right, and it's the kind of thing that has been on, they've been proposing for years and years, but this post 9-11 atmosphere has helped them to get this stuff passed.
[02:27:18.470 --> 02:27:21.072]  And they haven't even been satisfied with Patriot Act No.
[02:27:21.092 --> 02:27:21.072]  1.
[02:27:21.452 --> 02:27:22.913]  They're demanding even more power.
[02:27:24.675 --> 02:27:25.776]  So how do we stop them?
[02:27:25.836 --> 02:27:32.000]  I mean, they say it's for terrorists, but their definition of a terrorist is misdemeanors, according to Section 802.
[02:27:32.261 --> 02:27:40.047]  Well, it is really tough, because I think, with your help, there was a lot of awakening about Patriot Act No.
[02:27:40.067 --> 02:27:41.848]  1, and when we did have a clean vote on
[02:27:42.361 --> 02:27:48.305]  Repealing some of that in the House of Representatives, we actually won it overwhelmingly to repeal the sneak and peeks.
[02:27:48.685 --> 02:27:53.529]  But that, interesting enough, when it got to the conference, it was deleted.
[02:27:53.609 --> 02:27:59.573]  So they put in the bad stuff, they delete the good stuff, and then everybody leaves town and everybody forgets about it.
[02:27:59.953 --> 02:28:08.239]  It's a darn hard job, so we have to keep plugging away information to the American people is ultimately the only thing that counts.
[02:28:09.386 --> 02:28:10.786]  Absolutely, Congressman.
[02:28:11.527 --> 02:28:12.667]  We've got about a minute left.
[02:28:12.787 --> 02:28:15.308]  Folks will come back and take your calls, but Congressman's got to leave us.
[02:28:15.328 --> 02:28:17.669]  We appreciate him during this holiday week joining us.
[02:28:18.269 --> 02:28:21.130]  On the last minute, any other key issues we need to be made aware of?
[02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:30.713]  I think the, you touched on just about all of them, but I think it's the appetite that American people have for spending that is the big issue.
[02:28:30.833 --> 02:28:34.794]  Congressmen get, for the most part, re-elected and they vote for all the spending.
[02:28:35.538 --> 02:28:42.962]  Evidently, either they're totally uninformed or they support the idea that the government should continue to spend all this money domestically and police the world.
[02:28:43.502 --> 02:28:46.384]  But one of these days, it'll change because we're going bankrupt.
[02:28:46.544 --> 02:28:54.588]  We are literally, technically bankrupt, but when it's discovered, the dollar will crash and then we will have to cut back and we'll have to live within our means.
[02:28:55.069 --> 02:28:56.329]  Alright, many questions.
[02:28:56.489 --> 02:28:59.151]  Supreme Court, campaign finance, they say it's good.
[02:28:59.171 --> 02:29:02.573]  It violates the First Amendment.
[02:29:02.593 --> 02:29:03.313]  What do you think about it?
[02:29:03.749 --> 02:29:11.511]  Well, it's amazing because when it was on the House floor, there were a lot of us that were yelling and screaming, but DeLay and these other guys said, ah, don't worry about it.
[02:29:11.531 --> 02:29:13.791]  It's so bad that the courts will throw it out.
[02:29:14.151 --> 02:29:20.093]  And we're going to get some political pluses by saying that we're for campaign finance reform besides the president wants it.
[02:29:20.553 --> 02:29:26.954]  And I guess a lot of them were shocked when the courts actually didn't cover the Congress and rule it unconstitutional.
[02:29:26.994 --> 02:29:27.314]  All right.
[02:29:27.374 --> 02:29:29.214]  Congressman Ron Paul, have a great Christmas.
[02:29:29.635 --> 02:29:30.995]  Appreciate you coming on the show.
[02:29:31.015 --> 02:29:31.475]  God bless.
[02:29:32.705 --> 02:29:33.787]  We'll be back with your calls.
[02:29:36.852 --> 02:29:37.753]  We're on the march.
[02:29:38.254 --> 02:29:39.857]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.778 --> 02:29:43.483]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.724 --> 02:29:48.385]  I really needed to lose weight.
[02:29:48.425 --> 02:29:50.027]  I was tired, lethargic.
[02:29:50.227 --> 02:29:55.391]  So far, using the Collagenate, I've lost 46 pounds.
[02:29:55.411 --> 02:29:57.692]  46 pounds with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:29:58.093 --> 02:29:59.794]  Bernadine, tell me about those inches.
[02:30:00.134 --> 02:30:03.557]  Inches off of my chest, my waist, my hips, my thighs.
[02:30:03.857 --> 02:30:07.340]  I was at about a 20, pushing into a size 22.
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:09.361]  I'm down to a size 14.
[02:30:09.762 --> 02:30:11.523]  People have been telling me I look younger.
[02:30:11.983 --> 02:30:15.506]  I've lost 46 pounds with Collagenate.
[02:30:15.806 --> 02:30:18.288]  It's just one of the best investments I've ever made.
[02:30:18.508 --> 02:30:24.592]  I am so glad that Bernadine took my advice to lose weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vem and Vigor.
[02:30:24.832 --> 02:30:28.455]  That was Bernadine's personal experience and it can be yours next.
[02:30:28.515 --> 02:30:29.375]  What are you waiting for?
[02:30:29.695 --> 02:30:30.916]  Call Vem and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:30:30.956 --> 02:30:31.176]  That's 1-800-622-8446.

[02:30:47.407 --> 02:30:48.908]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:30:49.369 --> 02:30:53.692]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:30:54.072 --> 02:30:54.953]  It still is!
[02:30:55.573 --> 02:30:59.096]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:30:59.396 --> 02:31:01.217]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:31:01.757 --> 02:31:03.799]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:31:04.378 --> 02:31:06.379]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:31:06.779 --> 02:31:14.401]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:31:14.801 --> 02:31:18.582]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[02:31:47.455 --> 02:31:50.998]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[02:31:51.338 --> 02:31:51.658]  Yes.
[02:31:51.938 --> 02:31:54.320]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood.
[02:31:54.580 --> 02:31:56.762]  The richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[02:31:56.882 --> 02:32:05.809]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, 2 ounces of juice have the same nutrition as 3 pounds of choice garden produce.
[02:32:05.949 --> 02:32:13.654]  The get up and go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[02:32:13.895 --> 02:32:15.776]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.

[02:32:56.633 --> 02:33:00.957]  Hey, I know we've had a lot of callers holding for a while, and I couldn't get to you with Ron Paul.
[02:33:01.137 --> 02:33:02.358]  I wasn't even talking a lot.
[02:33:02.378 --> 02:33:04.079]  I was just throwing out questions at him.
[02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:10.284]  You heard him talk about the depression that's coming up, the plunging dollar going to happen, gold going up.
[02:33:11.205 --> 02:33:14.047]  You heard him talk about the torture, the police state, all of it.
[02:33:14.628 --> 02:33:15.889]  Now let's go back to the call.
[02:33:16.029 --> 02:33:18.591]  Sean, John, HW, Tim, Mike, others.
[02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:21.351]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:21.391 --> 02:33:26.697]  I'm going to go through your calls real quick and back into some more important news.
[02:33:27.457 --> 02:33:32.503]  Shawn in Colorado, I made you hold earlier because I gave you about 30 seconds before a break.
[02:33:32.523 --> 02:33:38.489]  You were talking about one of our wonderful affiliates, and I don't ever want to bash our affiliates, you were saying a host on 1370.
[02:33:40.766 --> 02:33:50.650]  Was going to the argument of, and this is what I saw in the law enforcement magazines, this is the argument that's been put out by the talking heads, a lot of well-meaning, intelligent people buy into.
[02:33:51.430 --> 02:33:59.053]  And they say, well, you know, there's a bomb that's going to kill 100 of our troops, you torture them to get the answers, what are you going to do?
[02:33:59.553 --> 02:34:02.214]  Well, in reality, you never really run into those situations.
[02:34:03.035 --> 02:34:03.415]  Okay.
[02:34:03.435 --> 02:34:05.497]  I mean, that's a bunch of government PR.
[02:34:06.017 --> 02:34:22.190]  And again, there's a greater damage in what happens to your troops when they do get captured, because then they're certainly going to get tortured, and then you can't punish those that did it, and you've lost the moral high ground, and then from there, torture's going to be legitimized.
[02:34:23.010 --> 02:34:25.232]  And I know there's a lot of well-meaning people
[02:34:26.161 --> 02:34:29.802]  Well, that's right, Alex, and what it comes down to is that it's a bunch of
[02:34:50.908 --> 02:34:57.032]  Brainwashing that's going on to all these people in America who have no idea what's going on.
[02:34:57.572 --> 02:35:03.536]  They now take a stand on a terrorist, or Saddam, just because we brought him out to light.
[02:35:03.616 --> 02:35:10.620]  And then, at the same time, we enact Bush Signs 24-17, which further takes away our rights.
[02:35:13.737 --> 02:35:17.301]  You know, do people stop listening and start paying attention?
[02:35:17.441 --> 02:35:18.162]  That is the question.
[02:35:28.746 --> 02:35:37.173]  What we need to do is arrest those that flew the 8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda out to safety in Afghanistan, who work for the CIA.
[02:35:37.593 --> 02:35:42.837]  We need to have an investigation of why the hijackers were trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[02:35:43.178 --> 02:35:47.221]  We need to have an investigation of government tearing out terror attacks.
[02:35:48.067 --> 02:35:51.489]  Again, it's the big monolithic government that can't be trusted.
[02:35:52.129 --> 02:36:01.835]  And why they're trying to sell us this idea of torture being good, listen, I want to have anybody on who thinks torture is good, I want to debate this fact.
[02:36:02.375 --> 02:36:03.496]  What's this gentleman's name?
[02:36:05.056 --> 02:36:05.337]  Sean.
[02:36:06.217 --> 02:36:07.098]  No, no, not Sean.
[02:36:07.558 --> 02:36:10.780]  I apologize, that would be Rabbi Stivak.
[02:36:11.460 --> 02:36:12.641]  And he's out of New York.
[02:36:13.161 --> 02:36:13.801]  Rabbi who?
[02:36:14.382 --> 02:36:15.642]  Rabbi Stivak.
[02:36:16.283 --> 02:36:16.763]  Stivak.
[02:36:18.279 --> 02:36:20.000]  S-P-I-B-A-C-K.
[02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:26.744]  Say it slowly, S-T-I... S-P, as in Paul, I, B-A-C-K.
[02:36:26.884 --> 02:36:29.987]  You know, maybe it's just my own audio, but a lot of what you're saying is distorted.
[02:36:30.667 --> 02:36:31.548]  Are you on a cell phone?
[02:36:31.928 --> 02:36:32.829]  Yes, sir, I am.
[02:36:33.029 --> 02:36:37.712]  Okay, S-P-I... B-A-C-K.
[02:36:39.593 --> 02:36:40.654]  I'd like to have him on.
[02:36:42.270 --> 02:36:44.292]  Well, you know, I would love to hear you talk with him.
[02:36:44.352 --> 02:37:05.488]  I mean, I brought up the fact that, you know, at the same time they passed the, you know, 2217, and, you know, if he's all in favor for torture, you know, or to save a couple hundred people's lives, how come they're not having that same passion when they hear about John Ashcroft saying 11.5 million people will die?
[02:37:05.648 --> 02:37:11.513]  Don't you think maybe we should torture him and find out what he knows about 11.5 million people in this very country?
[02:37:14.323 --> 02:37:19.725]  Sean, I do not wish any harm upon John Ashcroft or Bill Clinton or George Bush.
[02:37:19.745 --> 02:37:23.907]  Neither do I. I was just stating a point about torture and it's bad all around.
[02:37:23.987 --> 02:37:24.787]  It is bad all around.
[02:37:24.807 --> 02:37:25.487]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:27.148 --> 02:37:30.909]  Look, the point here is, this shows how bad things have gotten.
[02:37:31.790 --> 02:37:34.831]  The government makes you feel threatened and says the terrorists are going to get you.
[02:37:36.022 --> 02:37:38.903]  And then, oh, uh, tortures the answer.
[02:37:38.963 --> 02:37:46.807]  I mean, look, 24, Threat Matrix, these shows on TV, every time I tune into them, they're torturing somebody, and it's good!
[02:37:47.388 --> 02:37:49.309]  They're warping our minds!
[02:37:49.989 --> 02:37:52.690]  The same thing happened in Nazi Germany.
[02:37:54.231 --> 02:37:56.512]  We cannot allow this to happen.
[02:37:57.713 --> 02:38:00.534]  Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[02:38:02.116 --> 02:38:04.738]  Now when you start letting the government do that, you're in deep trouble.
[02:38:05.139 --> 02:38:10.043]  Be more afraid of the government than you are terrorists, folks, because the government is the terrorist.
[02:38:10.063 --> 02:38:13.225]  They're carrying out the attacks, so you'll accept stuff like torture.
[02:38:14.406 --> 02:38:16.288]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:38:16.328 --> 02:38:21.412]  John, go ahead.
[02:38:21.632 --> 02:38:24.495]  That caller just sounded like a provocateur trying to wind you up.
[02:38:24.675 --> 02:38:28.438]  He's a liar if he claims to have listened to you for two years, and nobody's that retarded.
[02:38:29.301 --> 02:38:33.722]  Are you talking about that caller earlier saying none of our jets got shot down in Vietnam?
[02:38:34.182 --> 02:38:38.663]  Well, the Pentagon torturing a thousand Afghan POWs to death is not good for America.
[02:38:39.283 --> 02:38:50.186]  And Colonel Fletcher Prouty, who I'm sure you know, reported in his book JFK that the Viet Cong shot down 15 helicopters per ambush using nothing but bows and arrows wrapped in steel wire.
[02:38:51.846 --> 02:38:56.447]  In that book, JFK helped Stone get Operation Northwoods released, so that's a very
[02:38:57.353 --> 02:38:58.674]  I thought it was 8,000 choppers, 20,000 crew.
[02:38:58.694 --> 02:39:00.034]  2,000 fixed-wing aircraft shot down.
[02:39:12.065 --> 02:39:15.848]  Bill, helicopter contracts were our own worst enemy after Agent Orange.
[02:39:15.888 --> 02:39:16.969]  Well, that's what my uncle said.
[02:39:16.989 --> 02:39:22.653]  You know, he got shot down, I think, seven times, as it was listed, but really, I think he said, what did he say?
[02:39:22.733 --> 02:39:24.034]  Three of those were from fire.
[02:39:24.054 --> 02:39:27.776]  A lot of times, you know, getting shot, a lot of times, the things just broke down.
[02:39:28.177 --> 02:39:32.400]  I talked to a guy who got hit in the head twice by a helicopter rotor and survived.
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.561]  Those things are just death traps.
[02:39:35.782 --> 02:39:39.265]  Also, I wanted to ask you, did you hear last week the AP article?
[02:39:40.009 --> 02:39:44.354]  About the $230,000 speeding ticket under the Patriot Act?
[02:39:45.695 --> 02:39:46.817]  No, I didn't.
[02:39:47.377 --> 02:39:50.761]  That was in Tennessee on November 9th.
[02:39:50.841 --> 02:40:01.313]  Three men were arrested and $131,000 cash seized and a brand new Humvee seized and the people were held without bail even now, a month later.
[02:40:02.057 --> 02:40:03.478]  I can't give you calls about that.
[02:40:03.518 --> 02:40:05.440]  Will somebody email that to me and I'll post it?
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:06.241]  Yeah, I did email it.
[02:40:06.321 --> 02:40:07.262]  I'll email it again.
[02:40:07.282 --> 02:40:09.664]  Send it to tips at InfoWars.com.
[02:40:09.704 --> 02:40:21.354]  Yeah, it was in the Knoxville Nuisance on Friday, and a Tennessee State Trooper pulled this Humvee over from speeding it allegedly 90 miles an hour, which is above the top speed of the Humvee.
[02:40:21.875 --> 02:40:26.839]  He then searched their car and found this cash, and they were just traveling through Tennessee.
[02:40:26.859 --> 02:40:27.960]  They weren't going through a border.
[02:40:28.493 --> 02:40:34.017]  The International Border Checkpoint, the one guy allegedly said the word Canada, so they arrested them and seized all their property.
[02:40:35.117 --> 02:40:46.524]  So if you have a passport now, and a traffic stop, or you say you're going to Canada or Mexico or out of the country, and you have any cash on you, then they can seize that and arrest you under the Patriot Act.
[02:40:46.665 --> 02:40:47.285]  Over $3,000, yeah.
[02:40:47.745 --> 02:40:50.647]  Yeah, and this is a new precedent case.
[02:40:50.687 --> 02:40:53.569]  They said in the article that they've never seen this happen before.
[02:40:54.167 --> 02:40:59.810]  Even though they say it's legal to drive through the state of Tennessee or any other American state with cash.
[02:40:59.830 --> 02:41:02.192]  They're saying now you can't even go from state to state.
[02:41:02.272 --> 02:41:08.395]  Under asset forfeiture seizure, you've all heard the stories of the old lady with $10,000 in her purse because she doesn't trust banks?
[02:41:09.076 --> 02:41:11.697]  And they grab her $10,000 and say it's up to you to get it back?
[02:41:12.018 --> 02:41:17.701]  Right, they've been doing this on drugs for years and now they're using the Patriot Act, which apparently gives them even more authority.
[02:41:18.638 --> 02:41:22.501]  Hey, they're going after topless bars, county commissioners, and zoning disputes.
[02:41:23.002 --> 02:41:25.604]  They're using it for misdemeanors.
[02:41:25.664 --> 02:41:27.545]  People with marijuana paraphernalia.
[02:41:27.565 --> 02:41:30.147]  A guy with a marijuana pipe was charged with terrorism.
[02:41:31.008 --> 02:41:33.630]  And they got the ads on TV where you're a terrorist.
[02:41:33.930 --> 02:41:34.711]  You use drugs.
[02:41:34.751 --> 02:41:35.872]  I mean, it's sick, folks.
[02:41:36.172 --> 02:41:39.975]  Well, I've got this article also posted at AmericanAutobahn.com.
[02:41:40.556 --> 02:41:45.400]  In the news, if you just scroll down to the middle of the page, it's got the full text of the article.
[02:41:46.008 --> 02:41:46.968]  Alright, I'll find it.
[02:41:47.008 --> 02:41:48.889]  It'll be big news on this show.
[02:41:49.089 --> 02:41:50.249]  I miss a lot of stuff like that.
[02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.569]  Thanks.
[02:41:50.969 --> 02:41:52.630]  There's no way to keep track of all this, folks.
[02:41:52.850 --> 02:41:53.950]  I believe you, though, John.
[02:41:54.510 --> 02:41:56.631]  Can somebody call in and second that article?
[02:41:56.991 --> 02:42:02.713]  I don't think... John's given me good info in the past, but just... H-W in Colorado.
[02:42:02.893 --> 02:42:03.953]  H-W, you're on the air.
[02:42:04.673 --> 02:42:06.874]  Don't bother with this Rabbi Spilak.
[02:42:06.994 --> 02:42:10.455]  When that guy comes on on 1360, I turn the radio off.
[02:42:10.715 --> 02:42:12.196]  I don't want to bash our affiliates.
[02:42:12.216 --> 02:42:12.676]  Don't do it.
[02:42:13.376 --> 02:42:13.656]  Say again?
[02:42:14.418 --> 02:42:16.579]  Don't, it's a great, great station.
[02:42:16.679 --> 02:42:18.200]  They're all great stations.
[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:24.663]  But this, I'm saying with Rabbi Spilak, I don't waste my time and don't waste yours either, would be my suggestion.
[02:42:24.703 --> 02:42:26.323]  Is it Spibok or Spilak?
[02:42:26.864 --> 02:42:27.344]  Spilak.
[02:42:27.644 --> 02:42:33.787]  S-P like Paul, A-V like Lenin, A-K.
[02:42:35.296 --> 02:42:36.117]  Okay, now I got it.
[02:42:36.397 --> 02:42:36.617]  Right.
[02:42:37.017 --> 02:42:44.322]  I figure he's even a doctor, but the guy talks real nonsense and below any moral standard.
[02:42:44.482 --> 02:42:45.163]  Okay, listen.
[02:42:45.323 --> 02:42:47.304]  One thing I'm not going to have is bashing our stations.
[02:42:47.604 --> 02:42:48.965]  He has a right to the First Amendment.
[02:42:48.985 --> 02:42:49.746]  I'll try to get him on.
[02:42:50.276 --> 02:42:51.617]  Well yeah, but I don't listen to it.
[02:42:51.897 --> 02:43:00.662]  I only listen to Rob Noel, Eric Cederstrom, Bill Brumbaugh, you, and occasionally Stan Montius.
[02:43:00.802 --> 02:43:02.523]  All the others don't make any sense to me.
[02:43:03.243 --> 02:43:17.471]  Now you guys have been working wonderfully on explaining to the people that government is by definition, as I about five calls ago mentioned on your show, by definition evil.
[02:43:19.041 --> 02:43:26.025]  Only thieves, liars, and now I say murderers want to rule your life, and they make rules that don't even make sense.
[02:43:26.825 --> 02:43:34.230]  And of course, the way they print pieces of paper into money, that is not earned.
[02:43:34.450 --> 02:43:36.651]  That is by that elite, which doesn't want to work.
[02:43:36.671 --> 02:43:40.774]  And now they're going to rob your wealth, your energy, through devaluing it.
[02:43:40.794 --> 02:43:41.594]  Thanks, H.W.
[02:43:42.014 --> 02:43:42.455]  Thank you.
[02:43:42.855 --> 02:43:43.956]  Mike in Arizona.
[02:43:44.016 --> 02:43:44.876]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:43:44.916 --> 02:43:45.416]  Go ahead.
[02:43:47.158 --> 02:43:47.858]  Good to talk to you.
[02:43:48.652 --> 02:43:49.292]  Yeah, same here.
[02:43:50.292 --> 02:43:54.474]  About 25 years ago, there was a group of communist terrorists in Italy.
[02:43:55.154 --> 02:43:56.674]  A lot of people may not remember them.
[02:43:56.694 --> 02:43:57.834]  They were called the Red Brigade.
[02:43:58.875 --> 02:44:03.716]  And in 1978, they abducted the Prime Minister of Italy, Aldo Moro.
[02:44:03.736 --> 02:44:04.916]  I don't know if you remember that.
[02:44:04.956 --> 02:44:05.737]  Yes, I remember.
[02:44:06.577 --> 02:44:10.778]  And basically, they rounded up a bunch of Red Brigade members.
[02:44:11.873 --> 02:44:18.735]  And a lot of the police figured that some of these guys would have information as to possibly where Aldemora was.
[02:44:20.055 --> 02:44:22.636]  And they basically said, let's torture these people.
[02:44:23.256 --> 02:44:32.698]  And the commander of the investigation, a General Carlo Alberto della Chiesa, he said, Italy can survive the loss of Aldemora.
[02:44:32.838 --> 02:44:35.018]  What it would not survive is the introduction of torture.
[02:44:35.939 --> 02:44:36.339]  That's it?
[02:44:38.655 --> 02:44:40.717]  Just thought I'd leave you with that quote for today.
[02:44:41.118 --> 02:44:42.759]  Well, absolutely.
[02:44:43.019 --> 02:44:43.580]  Anything else?
[02:44:45.602 --> 02:44:45.922]  Nah.
[02:44:46.243 --> 02:44:46.823]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:44:47.384 --> 02:44:50.907]  Yeah, we're not America anymore and we start torturing people.
[02:44:52.149 --> 02:44:53.310]  Can't you understand that?
[02:44:54.151 --> 02:44:57.534]  Now, Israel admits they torture people, okay?
[02:44:58.835 --> 02:45:02.499]  But then it's come out and UPI, Harots, you name it,
[02:45:03.382 --> 02:45:11.669]  In the last two years that Israel will conduct bombings and then blame it on people or they even have squads of Palestinians that work for them that are doing it.
[02:45:12.029 --> 02:45:15.052]  I'm not saying all the bombings are Israel, but it makes sense.
[02:45:15.712 --> 02:45:25.140]  You want weapon sales, you want to expand, you want to oppress your own people, you want to have rules and regulations on your own populations, you want to keep the war going, you do this.
[02:45:26.864 --> 02:45:29.887]  And that's not Alex Jones, that's Haratz, that's the Jerusalem Post.
[02:45:29.947 --> 02:45:32.689]  I have those articles in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:45:33.089 --> 02:45:34.711]  Now Israel admits they torture.
[02:45:35.251 --> 02:45:36.812]  Folks, our government tortures too.
[02:45:37.253 --> 02:45:42.257]  In Fort Benning, Georgia, they've trained Latin Americans, Arabs, a lot of these people in torture.
[02:45:42.958 --> 02:45:43.278]  Okay?
[02:45:44.259 --> 02:45:46.300]  You got legalized torture in Saudi Arabia.
[02:45:46.461 --> 02:45:48.883]  I don't want to become like the Saudi Arabians.
[02:45:49.583 --> 02:45:49.923]  Okay?
[02:45:50.524 --> 02:45:52.986]  Now they don't even call it torture though, they call it punishment.
[02:45:53.675 --> 02:45:54.295]  Yeah, they will.
[02:45:54.375 --> 02:45:57.137]  If you're a Christian, they see you with a cross.
[02:45:57.777 --> 02:45:58.938]  They will grab it off of you.
[02:45:58.958 --> 02:45:59.878]  They will beat you up.
[02:46:00.278 --> 02:46:02.680]  So I am tired of this worship of the Muslims, folks.
[02:46:03.460 --> 02:46:03.740]  Okay?
[02:46:04.060 --> 02:46:05.801]  Understand, I'm not here against Israel.
[02:46:05.841 --> 02:46:07.042]  I'm not here against any of these people.
[02:46:07.582 --> 02:46:08.743]  I'm against corrupt governments.
[02:46:08.943 --> 02:46:11.464]  And I do not want Saudi Arabia involved in our lives.
[02:46:11.484 --> 02:46:15.386]  I mean, I have family who work for oil companies and buddy
[02:46:16.209 --> 02:46:18.070]  You don't congregate on Christmas.
[02:46:18.170 --> 02:46:19.671]  You don't congregate on Sunday.
[02:46:20.211 --> 02:46:21.371]  You don't wear a cross.
[02:46:21.492 --> 02:46:24.753]  You don't talk about Jesus, or they will kill you!
[02:46:26.474 --> 02:46:27.794]  And there they torture people.
[02:46:28.415 --> 02:46:30.476]  They've got an incredibly corrupt government.
[02:46:32.136 --> 02:46:37.639]  Now, I don't want to be like Israel, and I sure don't want to be like Saudi Arabia.
[02:46:40.832 --> 02:46:44.155]  And I don't want to be like any of these Middle Eastern countries, folks.
[02:46:44.415 --> 02:46:45.056]  And you know what?
[02:46:45.076 --> 02:46:46.157]  We need to stay out of it.
[02:46:47.978 --> 02:46:50.220]  And, you know, why'd they kill Yishak Rabin, folks?
[02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:56.045]  Because, according to Barry Hamish, and all the other evidence that's come out, because he had a real plan for peace.
[02:46:56.946 --> 02:46:59.608]  And are there Arabs that don't want peace, that want to destroy Israel?
[02:46:59.668 --> 02:47:00.188]  You bet.
[02:47:01.049 --> 02:47:02.210]  But let me tell you something.
[02:47:04.212 --> 02:47:06.574]  There are peace plans that'll work, folks.
[02:47:07.442 --> 02:47:16.809]  But both sides, the military industrial complex in Israel and the terrorist complex that is controlled by the Arab states wants these wars to continue.
[02:47:17.249 --> 02:47:19.731]  Because that's how they maintain their control over the region.
[02:47:19.991 --> 02:47:22.393]  That's their pretext for police state.
[02:47:23.373 --> 02:47:24.734]  The same thing's happening here.
[02:47:25.415 --> 02:47:27.576]  I know we've got a lot of other callers, but I've got to hit some news.
[02:47:27.596 --> 02:47:31.479]  We'll try to get a few calls in here in the final segment.
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:35.902]  Police call for remote button to stop cars.
[02:47:36.002 --> 02:47:36.643]  London Guardian.
[02:47:37.307 --> 02:47:39.428]  They already have this in your ignition, folks.
[02:47:39.869 --> 02:47:41.830]  Motorists face new Big Brother technology.
[02:47:42.310 --> 02:47:47.653]  After speed cameras, road humps, and mobile phone bans, there could be more bad news for Britain's motorists.
[02:47:47.953 --> 02:47:51.395]  Police are urging ministers to give them the power to stop vehicles by remote control.
[02:47:51.935 --> 02:47:59.360]  If what will be seen is yet another example of the increasing power of Big Brother, drivers face the prospect of their cars being halted by someone pushing a button.
[02:47:59.820 --> 02:48:01.281]  It's already in your ignition, folks.
[02:48:01.701 --> 02:48:04.663]  The police lobby is being led by Superintendent Jim Hammond.
[02:48:05.663 --> 02:48:30.835]  of Sussex Police who chairs an association of police officers technology working group which is examining the idea providing an effective means to remotely stop a vehicle and fast becoming a priority Hammond told the European Conference the development of safe controlled system to enable remote stopping has the potential of directly saving lives and they go further Howard
[02:48:32.227 --> 02:48:33.388]  Well, let's read this guy's quote.
[02:48:33.428 --> 02:48:40.052]  Brett Morris, Deputy Director of AA Motoring Trust, said, People don't like the idea of Big Brother taking over their driving.
[02:48:40.392 --> 02:48:45.815]  In years to come, that might be acceptable, but it's very, very inappropriate that there is a step-by-step approach.
[02:48:46.195 --> 02:48:49.177]  They're already starting nationwide satellite taxation in Germany.
[02:48:49.737 --> 02:48:55.578]  Starting it now in England, they're announcing that they want to do it here, and the systems are already in all the new cars.
[02:48:55.958 --> 02:48:58.159]  They put the grid in, then they announce it.
[02:48:58.539 --> 02:49:06.741]  Just like they started taking your DNA at birth 33 years ago, now 33 years later they go, oh, we want to start a national DNA database, we just so happen to have your blood.
[02:49:08.781 --> 02:49:09.361]  Unbelievable.
[02:49:09.741 --> 02:49:11.702]  Israel planning to attack Iran.
[02:49:11.842 --> 02:49:12.942]  Massive escalation.
[02:49:13.102 --> 02:49:14.262]  After Israel, the U.S.
[02:49:14.302 --> 02:49:15.543]  and England sold them the stuff.
[02:49:15.963 --> 02:49:17.303]  I have BBC articles on that.
[02:49:18.294 --> 02:49:23.936]  Israel's considering a military strike to destroy the nuclear program of Iran, now regarded as Tel Aviv's number one enemy.
[02:49:24.236 --> 02:49:42.803]  The Israeli daily, Harat, cited Defense Minister Saul Movass, I can't pronounce names, I'm sorry, as telling Israel Radio Persian Service last week that if a decision was made to destroy Iran's nuclear capability, necessary steps will be taken so that Iranian citizens will not be harmed.
[02:49:43.709 --> 02:49:46.010]  That is really scary escalation.
[02:49:46.030 --> 02:49:48.191]  No telling what the Iranians will do.
[02:49:49.672 --> 02:49:50.292]  Listen to this.
[02:49:50.592 --> 02:49:56.694]  Parents told shouting at youth football matches is child abuse and your children will be taken.
[02:49:57.755 --> 02:50:09.860]  Parents of young footballers who shout criticism from sidelines during matches will face criminal charges in the future and be guilty of child abuse under new guidance from the sports governing body.
[02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:20.288]  Under new rules, parents who give lifts to children of neighbors or friends or of other children may also have to undergo police checks.
[02:50:21.149 --> 02:50:27.854]  The player protection policy also says that if they see a bruise on a soccer player, they've got to call the police.
[02:50:28.575 --> 02:50:31.377]  So now your child gets bruises playing soccer.
[02:50:32.018 --> 02:50:32.958]  I played soccer, boy.
[02:50:32.998 --> 02:50:34.600]  I talk about bruises all over my shins.
[02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:36.161]  Now they come grab your children.
[02:50:36.661 --> 02:50:39.684]  They've created this new core over there, just like here, to grab your children.
[02:50:40.293 --> 02:50:42.716]  There's another one concerned over tough new abuse rules.
[02:50:43.096 --> 02:50:43.677]  We'll be back.
[02:50:43.697 --> 02:50:45.739]  Stay with us.

[02:54:10.755 --> 02:54:20.002]  I want to encourage everybody out there who's listening to my voice to stop procrastinating, to join me in history fighting against tyranny and the New World Order.
[02:54:21.363 --> 02:54:23.264]  I've made 10 documentary films.
[02:54:23.384 --> 02:54:25.185]  We have found no better tool.
[02:54:25.445 --> 02:54:26.426]  This is not hype, folks.
[02:54:26.446 --> 02:54:26.986]  This is the truth.
[02:54:27.026 --> 02:54:27.747]  You've heard the listeners.
[02:54:28.507 --> 02:54:30.689]  No better tool at unlocking minds.
[02:54:32.430 --> 02:54:43.916]  90% of those that see 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, they're waking up.
[02:54:46.037 --> 02:54:47.498]  These videos are frightening.
[02:54:47.658 --> 02:54:48.519]  They're powerful.
[02:54:48.579 --> 02:54:49.379]  They're dynamic.
[02:54:49.439 --> 02:54:50.240]  They're long.
[02:54:51.195 --> 02:54:53.076]  Each film is like multiple videos.
[02:54:53.156 --> 02:54:55.658]  I mean, take Police State's free total enslavement.

[02:56:29.386 --> 02:56:31.087]  Look at this article out of the Washington Post.
[02:56:31.187 --> 02:56:33.928]  China thanks Bush for Taiwan's stance.
[02:56:33.988 --> 02:56:34.948]  They thank him again!
[02:56:36.369 --> 02:56:38.310]  China thanks Bush for Taiwan's stance.
[02:56:38.350 --> 02:56:41.211]  Beijing issues new warning against move towards independence.
[02:56:41.731 --> 02:56:54.957]  China's President Hu Jintao thanked President Bush in a telephone call Saturday night for opposing any words or actions by Taiwan to alter its status and again warned that China would not tolerate the island's independence.
[02:56:55.277 --> 02:56:56.518]  State media reported Sunday.
[02:56:57.162 --> 02:57:10.807]  A telephone conversation came as President Chen Xinbin of Taiwan continued to ignore warnings by the United States and China against holding a referendum in March to demand that China redeploy hundreds of missiles it has aimed at the island.
[02:57:11.087 --> 02:57:25.173]  Oh, so you got a free country where they have elections, a republic, and we're against them, and we're against China pulling out its weapons, and the globalists, I don't want to say we, but those that control us, are arming China but not arming Taiwan.
[02:57:26.477 --> 02:57:28.559]  And I'm a liberal because I'm for Taiwan.
[02:57:28.819 --> 02:57:31.441]  You're conservative if you're for Red China!
[02:57:32.942 --> 02:57:33.642]  It's sick!
[02:57:34.883 --> 02:57:38.485]  And there's another Sunday Herald article, Concern Over Tough New Abuse Rules.
[02:57:39.806 --> 02:57:44.730]  And they're passing all these laws where if you yell at your child, you lose custody or are arrested.
[02:57:45.170 --> 02:57:48.452]  And it says they passed the guidelines because the government was abusing children.
[02:57:49.053 --> 02:57:53.776]  The guidelines to be published next month aim to make it more difficult for pedophiles to target young people.
[02:57:54.617 --> 02:58:06.908]  In the wake of the trial where school caretaker Ian Hutley was found to have already been accused of sex crimes years before he murdered Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.
[02:58:09.090 --> 02:58:12.372]  They always pass new laws because the government's raping and killing children.
[02:58:13.373 --> 02:58:20.219]  The very people that were grabbing children are abusing them, so now you yell at your child at a football game, they're gonna come after you.
[02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:22.081]  It actually says that!
[02:58:23.226 --> 02:58:26.629]  They're five times more likely in government to abuse children.
[02:58:27.430 --> 02:58:29.212]  So let's let them grab more children.
[02:58:29.892 --> 02:58:30.973]  With no oversight.
[02:58:32.375 --> 02:58:33.456]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:58:33.496 --> 02:58:34.196]  Back tomorrow.
