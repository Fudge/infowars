[00:00:04.106 --> 00:00:07.279]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:15.584]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:17.285]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.026 --> 00:00:19.126]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:20.587]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:22.248]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.908 --> 00:00:26.570]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.153]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:47.911]  It's all ready.
[00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:49.932]  Tuesday, the 9th of September, 2003.
[00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:56.757]  We're coming up Thursday on the two-year anniversary of the Military-Industrial Complex.
[00:00:58.018 --> 00:01:05.264]  Engaging in that bloody spectacle to try to re-engineer our society into high-tech enslavement.
[00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:17.867]  The good news is, worldwide, in some cases, a majority of the people, of very populous western nations, believe that the globalists carried out 9-1-1.
[00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:19.668]  And they believe correctly.
[00:01:19.748 --> 00:01:26.270]  So, the globalists can keep blowing stuff up and keep telling people, we're approaching the point where everyone will know it.
[00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.073]  Just simultaneously, like with Ceausescu, over in Eastern Europe, that the government is tyrannical and is behind it.
[00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:38.097]  There won't need to be radio shows like this one.
[00:01:38.357 --> 00:01:39.578]  There won't need to be websites.
[00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.659]  There won't need to be self-published books and videos.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.061]  Everyone's going to know the world is round and you're a bunch of killers.
[00:01:47.802 --> 00:01:49.623]  So you just keep doing what you're doing.
[00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:50.803]  Keep trying to scare us.
[00:01:52.324 --> 00:01:56.306]  You know, have Britney Spears out there selling us the lies and Peter Jennings.
[00:01:56.926 --> 00:01:59.267]  It isn't going to work.
[00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:01.088]  Do you understand me?
[00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.610]  You have already failed.
[00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:08.946]  Your shields are down.
[00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:10.748]  Your veils are down.
[00:02:11.028 --> 00:02:12.589]  The curtain has been pulled aside.
[00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.353]  Now folks, I was checking email last night and I've gotten about a hundred emails asking, where's Ron Paul?
[00:02:18.373 --> 00:02:19.094]  Where's Ron Paul?
[00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:20.915]  He was on the air and then suddenly you're off the air.
[00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:25.458]  Well, I know this.
[00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:32.163]  I have a news article here about Dr. David Kelly before he got waxing.
[00:02:32.203 --> 00:02:34.685]  Every time I'm doing an interview with the media, my phone goes dead.
[00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:49.220]  But right when Ron Paul came on, my connection to the network died on my end, so then there was some other stuff, so we just bailed out, but that's the government's fault probably, and I don't normally talk like that, but with the history of it with Big Guest happening,
[00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.731]  Only happens a few times a year, and it's always the big guest.
[00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.092]  That may be what happened.
[00:02:53.112 --> 00:02:57.835]  But hey, it's alright, because Ron Paul's coming back on today or tomorrow.
[00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:06.180]  We're not sure, but on this show today or tomorrow, you're going to hear Ron Paul, and he's going to talk about the depression that's coming.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.801]  No wonder they didn't want him to get on the air.
[00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:13.404]  We're going to be talking about the depression that's coming, the neocons, you name it.
[00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:19.569]  So that's today or tomorrow, I was told by his Chief of Staff yesterday afternoon.
[00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.091]  So stay with us for that, it'll be a big interview.
[00:03:23.172 --> 00:03:42.465]  Ron Paul said in his speech about a week and a half ago, I also gave a speech out at McKinney-Russ, to a packed crowd of great patriots, that he was threatened about his neocon speech, and told, how dare you, by one of President Bush's chief strategists.
[00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:46.286]  And that's on tape and we've aired that here on the network.
[00:03:47.106 --> 00:03:49.427]  So, very serious information.
[00:03:49.487 --> 00:03:59.251]  So this, this, the neoconspeech he gave to Congress is so important and it's on InfoWars.com in the news and focus section.
[00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:01.912]  Go get it off InfoWars.com.
[00:04:02.392 --> 00:04:11.796]  Email it out to everybody because he exposes them as tyrants, as Trotskyites, as followers of Machiavelli who want to destroy America.
[00:04:12.557 --> 00:04:13.557]  Every mindless
[00:04:14.498 --> 00:04:27.626]  Sean Hannity listener, and Limbaugh listener, everybody who thinks they're a Republican, who thinks they're a Conservative, who is really a slave, a zombie of the most big government promoting wicked demons imaginable.
[00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:29.967]  Stop being zombies, people!
[00:04:32.828 --> 00:04:42.354]  So, Ron Paul gave the speech to Congress, and we have it on the website, and they can't shut that down, so go get it right now.
[00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:45.775]  Alright, just massive news when we get back.
[00:04:45.895 --> 00:04:49.378]  Massive, massive, major, huge, gigantic proportions.
[00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:51.119]  Stuff coming up.
[00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:58.084]  And I want to commend the affiliates, the sponsors, the listeners, the great folks running the show, Mark and Vince.
[00:05:00.346 --> 00:05:03.228]  Great wayfarers of talk radio.
[00:05:03.748 --> 00:05:06.230]  I'm Alex Jones, your captain.
[00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:14.018]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:14.698 --> 00:05:15.999]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.944]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:27.489]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:29.391]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:31.934]  This program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:32.094 --> 00:05:35.879]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:40.765]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:47.113]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:05:47.173 --> 00:05:48.995]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:51.536]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[00:05:51.616 --> 00:05:54.996]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:06.999]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:09.260]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:10.032 --> 00:06:16.235]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:24.480]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.664]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:06:32.984 --> 00:06:37.746]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:06:38.086 --> 00:06:42.788]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:06:43.308 --> 00:06:47.150]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.671]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:06:48.751 --> 00:06:52.833]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:06:53.253 --> 00:06:57.635]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:00.656]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:07:01.136 --> 00:07:03.259]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:08.465]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:09.426 --> 00:07:13.331]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:18.978]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:29.625]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:07:29.785 --> 00:07:34.128]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:42.653]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:49.314]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and al tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:07:49.414 --> 00:07:53.915]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:58.316]  Normally $48 each, get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:02.777]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:08:02.797 --> 00:08:03.037]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:16.131]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:28.636]  Alright my friends, we're back live.
[00:08:29.377 --> 00:08:35.019]  Already 8 minutes and 21 seconds into this first hour of broadcast.
[00:08:37.256 --> 00:08:40.637]  We're going to be having Ron Paul on the show today or tomorrow.
[00:08:40.657 --> 00:08:54.681]  We're lining that up to talk about the neocons and to talk about what's happening with the economy and his prediction of a depression in this country that he gave in a speech at an event that I also spoke at about a week and a half ago.
[00:08:54.701 --> 00:09:03.284]  I already mentioned that, but I know a lot of stations carried the news in the first five minutes of the show and missed the, well, the kickoff of the show.
[00:09:04.184 --> 00:09:06.965]  So we always kind of do a second kickoff here at the beginning.
[00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.033]  We're a little unorthodox here on the broadcast.
[00:09:12.255 --> 00:09:19.162]  Okay, all pleasantries aside, I am now going to go through the news.
[00:09:19.362 --> 00:09:25.409]  And of all the incredible, earth-shaking stuff I have in front of me, I want to cover this first.
[00:09:25.489 --> 00:09:28.512]  This is oninfowars.com right now.
[00:09:31.289 --> 00:09:38.332]  Honestly, I think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes, and we should just support that.
[00:09:39.933 --> 00:09:48.957]  Britney Spears, pop star, responding to a question from CNN analyst, Tucker Carlson, on whether she supports the war in Iraq.
[00:09:50.718 --> 00:09:52.778]  Well, she's the future patriot.
[00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:55.540]  She's the future man, the future human.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.301]  Totally mindless, degrading society.
[00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:00.225]  Nothing in her head.
[00:10:00.305 --> 00:10:01.385]  She's a tape recorder.
[00:10:01.485 --> 00:10:03.847]  You put what you want on the tape, it plays back.
[00:10:04.867 --> 00:10:10.630]  Honestly, I think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes, and we should just support that.
[00:10:13.632 --> 00:10:18.555]  I mean, folks, number one, if you're a real conservative or freedom lover, you cannot support Bush.
[00:10:18.575 --> 00:10:20.216]  He's a total puppet, big government pimp.
[00:10:20.316 --> 00:10:25.699]  But on top of that, we see all these pop stars, even Madonna, saying she was for the war.
[00:10:26.624 --> 00:10:42.093]  And when they're not up there teaching your daughters how to be lesbians, or how to destroy the family, or how to be good slaves, they're at the kickoff of the NFL last week telling us how great all of this is.
[00:10:43.974 --> 00:10:45.154]  So when is it going to end?
[00:10:46.955 --> 00:10:47.476]  Think of that.
[00:10:48.436 --> 00:10:55.240]  And now more soldiers have died and have been wounded since the end of so-called military operations
[00:10:56.972 --> 00:11:00.475]  Than did during the declared police action.
[00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:03.917]  Congress didn't declare war, but it's this rubber stamp.
[00:11:04.537 --> 00:11:08.860]  Caesar said we're invading Gaul type scenario.
[00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:12.403]  But think about how mindless that is.
[00:11:14.985 --> 00:11:18.267]  We have this nice photo from her at the kickoff of the NFL season.
[00:11:19.548 --> 00:11:22.570]  I guess doing a simulated orgy here with all these
[00:11:25.465 --> 00:11:44.834]  Gentlemen humping her and then of course she she takes time out to tell the reporters honestly I think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes and we should just support that so this is what's targeting twelve and thirteen-year-old girls and boys and I talked about this
[00:11:47.964 --> 00:11:52.687]  A little bit yesterday, but in no real detail, how I don't watch TV much anymore.
[00:11:52.727 --> 00:11:56.409]  I mean, literally, maybe an hour a week, but I hadn't been to a movie in about a month.
[00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:04.874]  And I didn't tell you what happened Friday when I went to see a film that I thought was actually pretty good, Pirates of the Caribbean.
[00:12:08.337 --> 00:12:23.327]  And walking in, I saw what had to be 12, 13, maybe 14-year-old girls with what could only be described as gang members, 18-year-old gang members, swarming all over them in plain view at the main entrance of the Barton Creek Mall by the AMC Theater.
[00:12:25.648 --> 00:12:29.330]  I walked out to get some popcorn because I wanted to get seats first.
[00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.851]  It was Friday night and it was quite crowded.
[00:12:31.392 --> 00:12:33.253]  I got my wife seated in the premium seats.
[00:12:33.928 --> 00:12:43.893]  And I go out to buy some popcorn and I look out the glass doors out there in the foyer and there's two young girls dressed like Britney Spears, French kissing each other.
[00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:48.715]  The gang members are beginning to hump on them.
[00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:51.137]  Folks, I'm watching this.
[00:12:51.157 --> 00:12:53.038]  In fact, I'm going to go out and make a documentary on this.
[00:12:53.138 --> 00:12:57.940]  I'm going to go out and just show what's going on in the malls and in our culture.
[00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:10.515]  And then show the direct correlation, the exact outfits, the exact behavior being carried out on the news and on MTV and then being carried out by young people.
[00:13:10.975 --> 00:13:12.716]  They're destroying our culture, folks.
[00:13:14.577 --> 00:13:15.438]  Well, it got worse.
[00:13:15.978 --> 00:13:17.098]  We went to the same movie theater.
[00:13:17.118 --> 00:13:19.099]  This was in a nice part of town, okay?
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.180]  Southwest Austin.
[00:13:21.441 --> 00:13:25.703]  This is near where Michael Dell and all the, you know, Richie Rich people live.
[00:13:26.203 --> 00:13:27.544]  It's one of the nicer areas of Austin.
[00:13:27.564 --> 00:13:28.284]  I'll just put it that way.
[00:13:29.366 --> 00:13:34.490]  I can't imagine what goes on in the movie theaters that are in the bad parts of town.
[00:13:35.631 --> 00:13:37.212]  Well, frankly, I have gone to those theaters.
[00:13:37.252 --> 00:13:38.373]  Nothing really bad's happening.
[00:13:38.393 --> 00:13:40.555]  I guess they're more normal than the sicko middle class.
[00:13:40.615 --> 00:13:44.238]  But the point is, I go, you know, I enjoyed that movie.
[00:13:44.278 --> 00:13:45.719]  Let's have some more escapism.
[00:13:45.739 --> 00:13:47.800]  You know, we deserve this in the fight against the New World War.
[00:13:48.241 --> 00:13:51.203]  I'm not saying don't go to a football game, don't go to a movie.
[00:13:51.483 --> 00:13:54.686]  What I'm saying is don't make it your god the first thing you do.
[00:13:55.512 --> 00:13:56.493]  Care about your country.
[00:13:56.533 --> 00:13:57.433]  Stand up for your country.
[00:13:57.473 --> 00:13:59.034]  And then, you want to go watch a baseball game?
[00:13:59.094 --> 00:13:59.314]  Fine.
[00:13:59.494 --> 00:14:00.955]  Just don't make it your god, folks.
[00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:03.336]  And that's what I'm saying is sick.
[00:14:04.016 --> 00:14:11.160]  So we go see, because Stattmiller was telling me how good and how realistic the movie Open Range was.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.260]  And I like Kevin Costner.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.981]  He makes some wholesome films occasionally.
[00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.302]  So I went to see Kevin Costner's Open Range.
[00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:17.583]  I also like Robert Duvall.
[00:14:19.264 --> 00:14:21.205]  And so I went to see the movie.
[00:14:22.546 --> 00:14:28.463]  Now we're walking in and I see similar scenes taking place, not quite as bad with the young people.
[00:14:30.023 --> 00:14:52.117]  And then I walk in and I see an ad for the new show called Threat Matrix, which is a Homeland Security term, and it says their powers are unlimited, their authority unquestioned, their means and operations unorthodox, and it shows them, the good guys, torturing somebody in a torture chair, a high-tech torture chair like Joseph Mengele had.
[00:14:52.777 --> 00:14:54.278]  Or something right out of 1984.
[00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:55.980]  And they're the good guys.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.642]  And so I see that and I get really mad.
[00:14:57.662 --> 00:14:58.963]  And I'm going, that's it, honey.
[00:14:59.223 --> 00:15:00.904]  We're not going to movies anymore either.
[00:15:00.924 --> 00:15:04.568]  If we want to watch something, we'll watch it on VHS or DVD.
[00:15:04.588 --> 00:15:05.348]  And I'm serious.
[00:15:05.469 --> 00:15:09.532]  I'm just... I can't... You cannot escape it anywhere.
[00:15:10.373 --> 00:15:11.014]  Guess what happens?
[00:15:11.054 --> 00:15:12.515]  We walk out at the end of the film.
[00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:14.317]  We walk over.
[00:15:15.337 --> 00:15:16.719]  And in between my wife's car.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:29.766]  And this Strawberry Tahoe that was parked next to her car, there's some guy with an elaborate knife that has the handle and the weird knife that comes out in between his fingers, stabbing the tires.
[00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:32.307]  And he had to be, he looked like he was about 50 years old.
[00:15:33.728 --> 00:15:37.610]  And I'm thinking, split second, this is some guy popping his girlfriend or his wife's tires.
[00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:45.454]  But then he pulls the knife out, I didn't even tell the story yesterday, and stands there smiling with a psychotic look in his eyes.
[00:15:46.306 --> 00:15:46.866]  With the knife.
[00:15:46.906 --> 00:15:48.187]  And I go, honey, get in the car.
[00:15:49.628 --> 00:15:54.530]  And it's at this point I wish that I'd waved my right and had the privilege card for a concealed carry.
[00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:58.412]  But I won't do that, folks, because it turns a right into a privilege.
[00:15:59.272 --> 00:16:01.613]  And he just starts stepping back and getting in his car.
[00:16:02.574 --> 00:16:04.094]  And he looks like a complete lunatic.
[00:16:05.095 --> 00:16:07.316]  We call the police, stop there, wait about 20 minutes.
[00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:09.957]  A cop car drives by.
[00:16:09.997 --> 00:16:10.737]  We're waving at them.
[00:16:10.757 --> 00:16:11.438]  They do nothing.
[00:16:12.198 --> 00:16:13.799]  The car's tire is going down.
[00:16:14.796 --> 00:16:17.178]  I leave a note in the guy's license number.
[00:16:17.218 --> 00:16:18.319]  We got his license number.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:25.303]  But, I mean, this country is just... just falling apart!
[00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:35.991]  I just... I can't even go to the movies in the wealthy part of Austin without seeing... it's basically Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:43.196]  A bunch of demon-possessed people running around, engaging in every form of idiocy,
[00:16:43.968 --> 00:16:47.011]  And then, you know, you wonder why the cops go in houses and shoot people.
[00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:50.053]  Oh, because every day they're fighting a bunch of psychopaths.
[00:16:50.073 --> 00:16:51.615]  That turns them into psychopaths.
[00:16:51.635 --> 00:16:57.900]  I mean, you can't associate and basically be involved in all this without turning into the devil, folks.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:11.171]  The whole society, it's like the globalists are a giant squid, and they've got their tentacles wrapped around America, pulling us down to the deepest reaches of Hades, psychologically and spiritually and financially.
[00:17:12.705 --> 00:17:14.286]  So what's the news I have for you today?
[00:17:14.426 --> 00:17:15.827]  I didn't spend enough time on this yesterday.
[00:17:16.328 --> 00:17:18.750]  Asian debt withdrawal, threat to U.S.
[00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:19.250]  deficit.
[00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:20.071]  No kidding.
[00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:21.972]  We're on the edge of total financial destruction.
[00:17:22.192 --> 00:17:23.373]  And you know I've never talked like that.
[00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:25.194]  Here's another one.
[00:17:26.335 --> 00:17:28.337]  Black copters over Oregon.
[00:17:28.737 --> 00:17:32.320]  President Bush visits rural Oregon to tout his forest plan.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.321]  Suddenly, huge fires burn.
[00:17:35.782 --> 00:17:38.164]  Now a small town is consumed with conspiracy theories.
[00:17:38.544 --> 00:17:40.506]  Now, I'm so conditioned that
[00:17:41.132 --> 00:18:01.281]  Two weeks ago, I had the Oregonian, I had the Salem paper, I had the Associated Press admitting that dozens of black helicopters were following people around and were seen by some setting fires right when Bush shows up to tout, we gotta get rid of these laws so we can cut down the trees so we can fight the fires.
[00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:03.362]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:18:03.702 --> 00:18:07.243]  Now even Salon, respected magazine, is saying it.
[00:18:07.343 --> 00:18:08.984]  And they've got a photo of Bush
[00:18:10.558 --> 00:18:13.620]  A real photo, folks, with black helicopters behind me.
[00:18:14.381 --> 00:18:15.942]  They're just throwing it in your face.
[00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:19.164]  The helicopters were indeed black.
[00:18:19.444 --> 00:18:20.145]  This is the article.
[00:18:20.845 --> 00:18:35.295]  And when they came throcking through the clear blue skies above Redmond, Oregon on the afternoon of August 19th, Don Barry happened to be having a slow day selling campers and fifth wheels at Courtesy RV.
[00:18:35.776 --> 00:18:38.818]  We just stood there in the lot, my friend Chuck and me,
[00:18:41.033 --> 00:18:45.855]  He says before launching into a bit of detail that the government sources will not confirm.
[00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:48.137]  They were Chinook military helicopters.
[00:18:48.157 --> 00:18:49.737]  Huge things with round noses.
[00:18:50.318 --> 00:18:51.158]  There were three of them.
[00:18:51.538 --> 00:18:53.199]  They were moving in tight formation.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.920]  Lollygagging over the woods.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.681]  Zigzagging in the town.
[00:18:57.701 --> 00:19:02.604]  And it goes on towards Black Buttes some 25 miles to the northwest.
[00:19:02.624 --> 00:19:05.605]  And it goes on to describe... I'll read this when we get back.
[00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:09.407]  The fire is suddenly starting after the black helicopters flew over.
[00:19:10.077 --> 00:19:14.821]  Of course, we have video of them trying to set Randy Weaver's shack on fire, a black helicopter.
[00:19:15.262 --> 00:19:18.665]  I mean, folks, if you live in Texas, chances are your town's been hit by them.
[00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:20.927]  Foreign troops screaming, buildings exploding.
[00:19:21.708 --> 00:19:26.793]  It's like being in an episode of Attack of the Clones in the final battle scene or something.
[00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:34.300]  Screaming forces, automatic weapons, old people having heart attacks, explosions, police threatening to arrest anyone that comes out of their houses.
[00:19:35.248 --> 00:19:38.190]  Then the news announces, yes, black helicopters hit and hit hard.
[00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.331]  Here's Alex Jones, the cook, who says they're bad.
[00:19:41.252 --> 00:19:42.652]  Front page of the paper actually said that.
[00:19:44.974 --> 00:19:47.155]  Czechoslovakian cribs running around, folks.
[00:19:48.296 --> 00:19:49.877]  Screaming, firing automatic weapons.
[00:19:49.997 --> 00:19:51.998]  And again, I talk about them, I'm crazy, they don't exist.
[00:19:52.298 --> 00:19:54.319]  And then it's in the paper, it's in all the Texas papers.
[00:19:56.981 --> 00:19:58.922]  I mean, you know, that's just America, folks!
[00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:03.625]  I've been to the concentration camps, they've got set up for you and your family, okay?
[00:20:04.446 --> 00:20:05.407]  They're going to put you in them.
[00:20:05.807 --> 00:20:07.167]  They're going to blow your head off.
[00:20:10.469 --> 00:20:14.751]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:19.734]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:20:20.114 --> 00:20:24.977]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:20:25.337 --> 00:20:27.138]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:20:27.178 --> 00:20:28.198]  can barely be read.
[00:20:28.498 --> 00:20:29.439]  It has faded that much.
[00:20:29.799 --> 00:20:33.702]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:42.348]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.

[00:21:21.148 --> 00:21:28.754]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.

[00:21:44.952 --> 00:21:48.836]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.

[00:22:10.158 --> 00:22:11.319]  Ask yourself these questions.
[00:22:11.459 --> 00:22:13.120]  Do you miss out on time with your loved ones?
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.501]  Are you making what you're worth?
[00:22:14.701 --> 00:22:17.223]  Are you wasting your life building someone else's fortune?
[00:22:17.443 --> 00:22:18.564]  Why not build your own?
[00:22:18.844 --> 00:22:25.048]  Imagine working your own hours, building your own business, generating an unlimited residual income, and having the time to enjoy it.
[00:22:25.268 --> 00:22:28.190]  With your own life force business, you can have all this and more.
[00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.232]  Why not have the home and car of your choice?
[00:22:30.452 --> 00:22:32.133]  Why not take luxurious vacations?
[00:22:32.353 --> 00:22:33.915]  Why not send your kids to college?
[00:22:34.175 --> 00:22:35.296]  Why not retire rich?

[00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:12.343]  Folks!
[00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:28.212]  You know, I had kind of a shocking statement to make there at the end of the last segment.
[00:24:30.433 --> 00:24:31.694]  But, think about it.
[00:24:31.734 --> 00:24:33.175]  That's the norm in history.
[00:24:33.235 --> 00:24:38.878]  Strong men, as part of the exercise of power, do horrible things to innocent people.
[00:24:41.138 --> 00:24:45.460]  And I've watched them building a giant steel trap for this country for decades.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:51.162]  And saying, well we're only going to use it when the terror comes, and the terror will come.
[00:24:51.562 --> 00:24:55.744]  Then we track back who's behind the terror, and it's the private interests that control our government.
[00:24:57.204 --> 00:25:07.448]  And here I am reading articles out of the Salem, Oregon newspaper, out of the Oregonian, out of Salon Magazine, and they're all the same headline, black helicopters.
[00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:20.260]  Show up the day before Bush is to attend a meeting, a fire gets set and Bush points at the fires behind him and says, Oh, see, you've got to pass the new laws.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:26.204]  I want to log all these trees or or the fires are going to get you.
[00:25:27.305 --> 00:25:35.231]  And understand, folks, I think it's fine to cut some of the trees and to go in and remove the trees that have fallen down.
[00:25:36.452 --> 00:25:36.652]  But
[00:25:37.907 --> 00:25:45.549]  This is a larger part of an agenda where they will selectively take land from people, take it off use, and give it to select corporations.
[00:25:45.569 --> 00:25:47.349]  So it gets a lot more complex.
[00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:58.652]  But even the mainstream media is pointing out it's pretty ridiculous to have army helicopters show up right before the president arrives, and where the helicopters are seen, simultaneous fires set independently of each other.
[00:25:59.212 --> 00:26:01.473]  Well, think about three and a half years ago.
[00:26:01.873 --> 00:26:05.534]  Remember the giant fires in dozens of states out west?
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:16.712]  And then it came out that Clinton had ordered the fires set and that the Meteorological Department of the Federal Government
[00:26:17.688 --> 00:26:19.950]  Had told them, do not set those fires.
[00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.572]  It's the driest it's been in decades.
[00:26:21.592 --> 00:26:24.995]  There's hot, dry winds from Mexico blowing into the whole Southwest.
[00:26:25.495 --> 00:26:27.237]  Do not set control burns.
[00:26:27.818 --> 00:26:31.501]  And every control burn got out of control and burned down whole towns.
[00:26:31.561 --> 00:26:32.842]  And FEMA came in and took over.
[00:26:33.103 --> 00:26:35.845]  And the UN came in to, quote, help the firefighters.
[00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:36.686]  Remember that on the news?
[00:26:36.966 --> 00:26:39.088]  The United Nations is helping us, see.
[00:26:39.629 --> 00:26:40.590]  Acclimating us.
[00:26:41.514 --> 00:26:41.954]  After 9-1-1?
[00:26:42.035 --> 00:26:52.062]  Oh, UN and NATO AWACS and 56 Norwegian F-16s are saving us!
[00:26:53.844 --> 00:26:55.665]  But here's Salon Magazine!
[00:26:56.045 --> 00:27:00.349]  Black Copters over Oregon is the headline of the article.
[00:27:01.189 --> 00:27:02.891]  There's a shot of Bush
[00:27:03.624 --> 00:27:09.547]  Or they just so happen to have Bush with the fires behind him with a bunch of black helicopters that just flew by.
[00:27:10.107 --> 00:27:17.990]  Believe me, helicopters don't get an authorization to fly over the President unless it comes directly from the President.
[00:27:19.791 --> 00:27:21.432]  They want you to know, folks,
[00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:27.051]  They put the black helicopter into your subconscious before they ever unleashed them on us.
[00:27:27.492 --> 00:27:32.437]  In the early 90s, they would make jokes about insane people see black helicopters.
[00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:33.858]  They don't exist.
[00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.900]  They're akin to space aliens.
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.485]  And I remember being on the radio going, yeah, this is kooky stuff and, you know, this isn't real.
[00:27:40.705 --> 00:27:42.827]  And then all of a sudden they were released on the country.
[00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:58.191]  Hundreds of mainstream news articles, burning buildings, foreign troops, bullets being shot into restaurants in Miami and in areas of North Carolina and Texas and Oregon and Old St.
[00:27:58.231 --> 00:27:59.934]  Louis across the line there.
[00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:02.570]  Why?
[00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:13.155]  Because then they could announce, okay, they are there, they're fire safety, submit to them, so we're trained now to have military troops come into our lives, shock troops, Imperial Praetorian Guard to attack us.
[00:28:13.335 --> 00:28:19.958]  And then they announce, the terrorists have hit us, we're getting rid of Posse Comitatus, we're going to put troops on the streets, they're going to monitor and run your lives.
[00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:25.400]  And the article says the copters were in Central Oregon.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.220]  Officials from the U.S.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.801]  Forest Service would later note
[00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:36.030]  to do reconnaissance in advance of the August 24th visit to the region by President George W. Bush.
[00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:43.332]  They were doing routine surveillance according to Ron Paul, a Forest Service Special Agent.
[00:28:43.753 --> 00:28:57.618]  The President planned to speak in the Camp Sherman, a little town near the Black Butte, where the fires were set by the helicopters, and to call controversially for the thinning of the 20 million acres of fire-prone public forest.
[00:28:58.553 --> 00:29:05.415]  And it goes on to describe... Well, it gets worse and worse, folks.
[00:29:06.976 --> 00:29:11.357]  And they come right out and say that the townspeople and others think the black helicopters set the fires.
[00:29:12.958 --> 00:29:15.279]  And there's a photo of a bunch of black helicopters flying over.
[00:29:15.419 --> 00:29:15.779]  Okay.
[00:29:17.499 --> 00:29:20.060]  And they admit that these are part of the secret government.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:25.122]  The black helicopters are the air fleet, the air cab of FEMA.
[00:29:25.868 --> 00:29:29.169]  Oh yeah, what did Jim Keith tell you 10 years ago, before they killed him?
[00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:31.629]  That they are the secret government's fleets!
[00:29:33.449 --> 00:29:40.911]  They've got giant bases all over the country, staffed with Russians, Czech Republic troops, you name it.
[00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:43.651]  Ready to unleash them on you folks.
[00:29:43.951 --> 00:29:49.212]  That's not counting our own troops from Fort Campbell, Kentucky and Fort Bryant.
[00:29:50.632 --> 00:29:53.313]  There are thousands of them ready to attack.
[00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:55.591]  I have the evidence.
[00:29:56.652 --> 00:29:58.373]  We'll talk about it and take calls when we get back.
[00:30:00.694 --> 00:30:01.594]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.094 --> 00:30:03.695]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.616 --> 00:30:07.297]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.144]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:30:16.284 --> 00:30:22.689]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the... ...Pram, Viagra, and many more.
[00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:24.110]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.191]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[00:30:25.231 --> 00:30:26.332]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:30:26.432 --> 00:30:27.753]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:42.854 --> 00:30:43.555]  Alright, folks.
[00:30:43.615 --> 00:30:45.096]  Your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:30:45.356 --> 00:30:46.917]  Dan, Pat, Rodney, and others.
[00:30:47.157 --> 00:30:51.521]  The toll-free number to join us on air is always 1-800-259-9231.
[00:30:51.681 --> 00:30:53.122]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:30:53.142 --> 00:31:05.691]  You know, for those tuning in for the first time, I'm talking about underground bases full of foreign troops and black helicopters.
[00:31:06.192 --> 00:31:07.272]  You're rolling your eyes.
[00:31:08.593 --> 00:31:09.234]  Jim Keith
[00:31:09.955 --> 00:31:13.157]  In the early 90's had books out full of news articles.
[00:31:13.637 --> 00:31:18.520]  And I would go to the microfilm and pull them up from Montana and Oregon and Texas.
[00:31:19.641 --> 00:31:21.522]  Where sheriffs investigated it.
[00:31:21.602 --> 00:31:23.464]  How they would harass local law enforcement.
[00:31:23.704 --> 00:31:27.226]  How they would be seen at military bases flying up out of the ground.
[00:31:28.707 --> 00:31:34.330]  The company in San Francisco that would take former Russian helicopter and Eastern Block pilots and hire them.
[00:31:34.771 --> 00:31:36.872]  They'd see Heinz flying up out of the ground.
[00:31:37.132 --> 00:31:38.233]  This is mainstream news.
[00:31:39.113 --> 00:31:40.054]  Spring Towns!
[00:31:40.094 --> 00:31:42.055]  It was in local papers here in Central Texas.
[00:31:42.956 --> 00:31:46.058]  The Burnett Bulletin had an article about it.
[00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:48.520]  The helicopters were spraying people.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.282]  The editor walked out and saw it happening, took a photo of it.
[00:31:52.984 --> 00:31:53.664]  It's amazing!
[00:31:53.744 --> 00:31:59.409]  And then Jim Keith wrote another book about it, Endgame Strategy, Black Helicopters 2, Endgame Strategy, The New World Ordered.
[00:32:00.369 --> 00:32:02.991]  Went in for a minor knee surgery, said, do not put me under.
[00:32:03.532 --> 00:32:05.393]  Even had a written order not to.
[00:32:05.433 --> 00:32:06.574]  He died during the surgery.
[00:32:06.874 --> 00:32:07.895]  Then a month later, his
[00:32:09.608 --> 00:32:14.212]  His publisher died, mysteriously, of the same thing.
[00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:15.553]  Just dropped dead.
[00:32:15.573 --> 00:32:18.595]  I mean, they don't want you knowing about this.
[00:32:19.596 --> 00:32:25.321]  And then you've got, before the President comes, oh yes, those are secret black helicopters that the Feds admit.
[00:32:25.461 --> 00:32:26.542]  They have a Fed here.
[00:32:27.262 --> 00:32:28.724]  This Park Service spokesman.
[00:32:28.744 --> 00:32:31.546]  Those are for the President and his surveillance men.
[00:32:32.867 --> 00:32:38.992]  Since when is it black helicopters flying around with fire starting behind them as they go?
[00:32:43.413 --> 00:32:44.073]  Think about that!
[00:32:44.093 --> 00:32:51.836]  They've got hordes of criminals, and foreigners, and yes, even a lot of our own troops that have proven themselves to be criminal.
[00:32:52.457 --> 00:32:54.738]  The good troops that have refused to fire on U.S.
[00:32:54.778 --> 00:33:03.901]  citizens in the questionnaires they're openly given are sent overseas to enjoy depleted uranium and anthrax and smallpox shots.
[00:33:04.242 --> 00:33:08.163]  Those that say no, the 24% get promoted and get to stay here.
[00:33:13.208 --> 00:33:14.449]  That's America, folks!
[00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:17.671]  Just giant armies of these people.
[00:33:18.631 --> 00:33:19.472]  Well, they're not that big.
[00:33:19.512 --> 00:33:32.059]  Tens of thousands sounds huge, but it's still an important cadre of those ready to create total mayhem and something akin to the Red Terror.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.121]  Instantly, the globalists snap their fingers.
[00:33:36.262 --> 00:33:36.822]  Cities will
[00:33:37.541 --> 00:33:38.481]  Set on fire.
[00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:40.142]  Reg's will be blown up.
[00:33:40.522 --> 00:33:42.022]  And they're going to blame it on the Patriots.
[00:33:42.042 --> 00:33:43.483]  They're going to blame it on the Conservatives.
[00:33:46.723 --> 00:33:48.764]  I mean, John Stossel even did a report on it.
[00:33:49.724 --> 00:33:50.104]  Admit it!
[00:33:50.144 --> 00:33:50.945]  I've got it on tape!
[00:33:51.385 --> 00:33:55.886]  That, well, it's true, the Feds started the fires, but, you know, they didn't mean it.
[00:33:57.966 --> 00:34:03.688]  And now these new articles about black helicopters and setting fires and witnesses seeing them and
[00:34:04.651 --> 00:34:07.713]  And admitting it's some secret group of FEMA for the president?
[00:34:10.295 --> 00:34:17.980]  Folks, I have... I have pulled up at burnout buildings while water is still dripping off of them.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:18.260]  Okay?
[00:34:18.881 --> 00:34:22.623]  And you walk over to an old lady on the street corner, say, in Kingsville, Texas.
[00:34:22.864 --> 00:34:23.964]  What happened here last night?
[00:34:24.905 --> 00:34:25.645]  Oh, sir!
[00:34:26.406 --> 00:34:29.108]  Eight big black helicopters attack!
[00:34:29.188 --> 00:34:29.828]  Oh!
[00:34:30.769 --> 00:34:32.230]  There's a portable Hispanic lady.
[00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.171]  We've got her in Police State 2000.
[00:34:34.352 --> 00:34:36.233]  Try to talk to other old folks, they'd run in fear.
[00:34:37.074 --> 00:34:41.437]  Talk to local police and they'd go, well, there was a drill with some special forces.
[00:34:41.457 --> 00:34:44.019]  There were foreign troops involved.
[00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.161]  We're not able to talk to you right now about it.
[00:34:47.722 --> 00:34:48.982]  What's your problem with it?
[00:34:50.303 --> 00:34:51.304]  Why didn't you warn the public?
[00:34:51.324 --> 00:34:52.745]  We're not at liberty to say why.
[00:34:52.765 --> 00:34:55.667]  Well, why'd you do it next to a nursing home?
[00:34:56.308 --> 00:34:57.629]  I think it's time for you to leave.
[00:34:57.689 --> 00:35:02.232]  And as the SWAT team walks out to stand behind her, as WorldNet Daily reported years ago,
[00:35:03.166 --> 00:35:05.267]  You just ask, you know, why were the black helicopters attacking?
[00:35:05.827 --> 00:35:12.170]  Spokeswoman sitting there talking to you, all of a sudden guys walk out in black uniforms, start staring at you, kind of petting their handguns.
[00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.231]  Oh, sorry, we'll back out, we'll leave.
[00:35:15.611 --> 00:35:19.012]  Go to the next town, interview folks, same thing.
[00:35:19.032 --> 00:35:21.293]  Well, there were foreign troops, I'm not at liberty to say.
[00:35:21.813 --> 00:35:23.894]  Jack Compton said in Alice, Texas.
[00:35:25.735 --> 00:35:30.477]  We walk down a local neighborhood and the people walk out and go, yeah, we were told if we left our houses we'd be arrested.
[00:35:33.106 --> 00:35:35.027]  Then the helicopters come and blow things up.
[00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:37.709]  Covertly lease a building and then blow it up in front of everybody.
[00:35:37.989 --> 00:35:39.490]  Just massive acclamation.
[00:35:40.811 --> 00:35:46.774]  I don't want to get off into... back into black helicopters, but... This has been in our newspapers.
[00:35:46.794 --> 00:35:53.118]  This has been on the news here in Austin, and then still they'll... they call me Mr. Black Helicopter on the other talk shows and on the news.
[00:35:53.978 --> 00:35:59.982]  Black Helicopter, conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, leader of the Black Helicopter People.
[00:36:02.054 --> 00:36:06.019]  Just because we went and interviewed the police chief of San Antonio who threw him out for attempted bribery.
[00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:13.587]  I mean, I have the team of police on video saying they tried to bribe him and how they fired into restaurants and that's why they threw him out.
[00:36:13.627 --> 00:36:16.250]  You know, firing bullets into restaurants as people eat.
[00:36:16.611 --> 00:36:18.673]  I have a police chief saying that on tape.
[00:36:19.815 --> 00:36:20.696]  And the news articles.
[00:36:20.976 --> 00:36:21.677]  But still!
[00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:26.862]  I am the kook for reporting on it, so I'm sorry if you can't handle it.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:34.668]  I told you in 1998 they were planning to put microchips in you, that they were going to roll it out on the news and say how good it was.
[00:36:36.249 --> 00:36:38.991]  I told you that in 2000, read Army reports on air.
[00:36:39.251 --> 00:36:40.472]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:36:40.853 --> 00:36:42.634]  Now they're on the news telling you how good it is.
[00:36:43.755 --> 00:36:46.697]  I'm telling you they've built big fat camps for you and your family.
[00:36:50.407 --> 00:36:52.408]  Yes, we're living in bizarro land.
[00:36:52.508 --> 00:36:54.969]  Crazy things are happening right now.
[00:36:56.529 --> 00:36:59.330]  Yesterday I read, terror plan to empty London.
[00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:05.012]  Dramatic plans for the mass evacuation of London in the event of a major terrorist attack have been announced by the government.
[00:37:05.933 --> 00:37:12.155]  Emergency services have drawn up schemes to move tens of thousands of people by road and rail to special camps.
[00:37:13.198 --> 00:37:15.019]  In the home counties.
[00:37:15.179 --> 00:37:21.483]  Funny, I figured out six, seven years ago they were going to have mass disasters, fake terror attacks to do it, and magically it all happened.
[00:37:21.584 --> 00:37:23.045]  Oh, I was reading CFR documents.
[00:37:23.645 --> 00:37:30.289]  Transport Secretary Alistair Darling said plans exist to cover every eventuality, including the very worst.
[00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:38.995]  And it goes on in one of the articles to say they include herding Londoners into rest and reception areas.
[00:37:41.357 --> 00:37:49.445]  That's okay because Britney Spears says, quote, honestly I think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes and we should just support them.
[00:37:50.325 --> 00:37:52.527]  Now why am I covering what's happening in England?
[00:37:52.868 --> 00:37:55.230]  Because they've announced the same stuff here, folks.
[00:37:55.270 --> 00:38:03.718]  I've had Denver City Councilwoman on, I've read Detroit Free Press articles, I've read the federal plan, page 76 of Homeland Security legislation.
[00:38:05.059 --> 00:38:06.040]  I've read what's
[00:38:07.433 --> 00:38:14.218]  Sid Hasperson said, the FEMA guy in New Jersey, quote, under a red alert, you're an enemy of the state if you leave your home.
[00:38:14.679 --> 00:38:17.040]  All your freedoms will be stripped away from you.
[00:38:17.361 --> 00:38:19.802]  Freedom of assembly, freedom to move about freely.
[00:38:20.763 --> 00:38:21.764]  It's for your safety.
[00:38:22.004 --> 00:38:30.711]  They're trying to pass laws in Oregon where if one person blocks traffic, everyone on the street gets life in prison, quote, in a labor forest camp.
[00:38:31.531 --> 00:38:33.773]  Excuse me, forest labor camp.
[00:38:34.993 --> 00:38:37.574]  I'm reading Bill, sponsored by the head Republican.
[00:38:38.755 --> 00:38:39.555]  The head Senator.
[00:38:40.155 --> 00:38:40.576]  Menace.
[00:38:40.616 --> 00:38:41.636]  That's his name, folks.
[00:38:41.856 --> 00:38:43.137]  You couldn't write it this bad.
[00:38:43.317 --> 00:38:45.998]  It's like real, dark satire in the real world.
[00:38:46.338 --> 00:38:46.778]  It's true.
[00:38:46.858 --> 00:38:47.419]  It's happening.
[00:38:47.739 --> 00:38:48.299]  It's real.
[00:38:53.181 --> 00:38:57.143]  It's got gun possession, life in prison, and a labor forest camp.
[00:38:57.503 --> 00:38:59.484]  Forest... Forest?
[00:39:00.084 --> 00:39:01.125]  Labor camp?
[00:39:01.753 --> 00:39:13.122]  And I've had the City Council, the County Commissioner on from Washington State, where he was given the documents and told by local police that, oh yeah, and the feds, yeah, we're going to build a big camp for everybody out here.
[00:39:13.162 --> 00:39:13.842]  How's that sound?
[00:39:15.103 --> 00:39:15.944]  He's freaking out.
[00:39:18.544 --> 00:39:20.745]  And if we don't freak out, it's all over, folks.
[00:39:21.205 --> 00:39:47.235]  And how we burned in the camps later thinking, what would things have been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive, and had to say goodbye to his family, or if, during periods of mass arrest, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, hailing
[00:39:48.365 --> 00:40:11.339]  He and Ter at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase had understood that they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or wherever else was at hand.
[00:40:12.279 --> 00:40:17.963]  The organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding
[00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.632]  All of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine, would have ground to a halt.
[00:40:23.032 --> 00:40:24.693]  That was Homeland Security terrorists.
[00:40:24.713 --> 00:40:26.013]  He'd be considered a terrorist today.
[00:40:27.154 --> 00:40:29.835]  Alexander Sholts and Nietzsche, the Gulag archipelago.
[00:40:31.556 --> 00:40:43.361]  And oh, how we burned in the camps later, thinking what things, what would things have been like if every security operative would have went out at night to make an arrest and had been uncertain whether he would have returned alive.
[00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:50.406]  You know, I want to fix things peaceably, my friends.
[00:40:52.507 --> 00:40:56.710]  Because we're having big victories in the info war with our secret weapon, the truth.
[00:40:58.171 --> 00:41:02.454]  We're smashing the enemy's lies, we're destroying their foundations right now.
[00:41:03.234 --> 00:41:11.480]  The enemy combatants that have seized our government and our media, they're letting waste our institutions and replacing them with tyranny, with dark towers of wickedness.
[00:41:14.461 --> 00:41:19.806]  But there's a very good chance that they're going to go ahead and launch us into turmoil untold.
[00:41:22.368 --> 00:41:34.758]  And I just want you to know that the more you submit to them, the more you go along with them, the more you grovel to them, the more you are in disbelief as you watch the news and they tell you all of this about how it's good for you.
[00:41:35.879 --> 00:41:37.420]  I want you to know you only empower them.
[00:41:39.262 --> 00:41:42.484]  Let's talk to Dan in Ohio, then Pat, Rodney and others.
[00:41:42.504 --> 00:41:43.145]  Dan, you're on the air.
[00:41:43.892 --> 00:41:48.856]  Hey Alex, informational warrior here.
[00:41:48.916 --> 00:42:04.670]  I'm out here on the road passing out tapes to a lot of people and I gave one out today to a military personnel and he thanked me for giving it to him and I appreciate all that you're doing and long time listener and first time caller and trying to
[00:42:05.459 --> 00:42:13.304]  I warn people of what's going on around here and it's really hard to wake up some of these robots in these trucks.
[00:42:13.684 --> 00:42:16.486]  I don't know, they just don't want to listen or they're just scared, I guess.
[00:42:18.708 --> 00:42:21.069]  Well, it's like telling somebody they've got cancer.
[00:42:21.449 --> 00:42:25.212]  The doctor will tell you most people go into denial for about a week.
[00:42:26.973 --> 00:42:28.234]  Sir, you've got brain cancer.
[00:42:28.274 --> 00:42:28.794]  It's terminal.
[00:42:29.254 --> 00:42:30.175]  That's ridiculous.
[00:42:31.403 --> 00:42:33.884]  For a couple months down the road, they don't think it's ridiculous anymore.
[00:42:34.344 --> 00:42:36.684]  The thing here is we don't have brain cancer.
[00:42:39.485 --> 00:42:50.947]  We have something that could be fixed, but it's going to take, as a society, getting out of the nightly football and Britney Spears and all the rest of it and getting back to history and looking around us.
[00:42:51.387 --> 00:42:52.568]  Look at the gas prices.
[00:42:52.848 --> 00:42:55.488]  Look at how they want $87 billion more to fight terror.
[00:42:55.548 --> 00:42:56.088]  Give me a break.
[00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:58.489]  Look at all the corruption and the lies.
[00:42:59.415 --> 00:43:02.697]  And just the rampant evil that's going on.
[00:43:02.717 --> 00:43:09.960]  I mean, folks, how many of you have been sent a phone bill that had charges on it you didn't know?
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.581]  That's done on purpose, folks.
[00:43:11.821 --> 00:43:14.542]  You have a criminal corporate system, a criminal government.
[00:43:16.083 --> 00:43:19.004]  How many of you have seen the government lie to you or mistreat you?
[00:43:20.245 --> 00:43:21.505]  Come on, think for yourselves.
[00:43:21.945 --> 00:43:25.127]  How many of you have read a history book and know what governments are normally like?
[00:43:26.886 --> 00:43:28.847]  And some will say, well, yeah, that's what government is.
[00:43:28.907 --> 00:43:29.267]  Yeah!
[00:43:29.767 --> 00:43:31.108]  America was different, folks.
[00:43:31.388 --> 00:43:33.008]  We've got to stand up against evil!
[00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:36.289]  Anything else, Dan?
[00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:38.650]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:39.911]  We'll be beside you all the way.
[00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:40.431]  All right.
[00:43:40.471 --> 00:43:41.311]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:42.672]  Let's talk to Pat in Indiana.
[00:43:42.692 --> 00:43:43.312]  Go ahead, Pat.
[00:43:44.172 --> 00:43:45.173]  Hello.
[00:43:45.193 --> 00:43:54.356]  I was just calling you to tell you that I went to a meeting with Congressman Pence and Senator Alan Paul about a week ago.
[00:43:54.841 --> 00:43:55.901]  A week and a half ago.
[00:43:56.301 --> 00:44:00.602]  Really, the public wasn't invited, but the radio station made a mistake and invited everybody.
[00:44:01.402 --> 00:44:20.486]  But what it was all about, it was about how Indiana is number one on the list for being broke, and that if this Indiana was in another country, we would be the same as considered a third world nation, that one out of every four... Yeah, but that, and again, I don't know how many years you've been listening, Pat?
[00:44:21.046 --> 00:44:22.347]  Oh, for quite a while, since 9-11.
[00:44:24.727 --> 00:44:34.569]  Well, again, the government's own policy reports, the IMF and World Bank, they interviewed with Powellist about a year and a half ago from the BBC.
[00:44:34.929 --> 00:44:36.590]  He got the World Bank documents.
[00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.130]  They said America was next.
[00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.350]  This is all by design.
[00:44:40.851 --> 00:44:42.331]  They want to blow everything out.
[00:44:42.731 --> 00:44:46.192]  They want to decimate the economy to get control of our lives.
[00:44:46.812 --> 00:44:48.852]  We're going into receivership.
[00:44:50.753 --> 00:44:51.893]  Now, what I did
[00:44:52.577 --> 00:44:56.680]  Their question was, well, how can we bring businesses into Indiana?
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:03.204]  But I got a report called the www.Kafferman.com.
[00:45:03.224 --> 00:45:08.067]  Yeah, I made a film about the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
[00:45:08.528 --> 00:45:18.754]  Well, he said Indiana has $11.82 billion in surplus and that if they gave each man and woman and child back, they would have to give back $1,200,000.
[00:45:21.001 --> 00:45:24.162]  $921.
[00:45:21.041 --> 00:45:24.162]  He was the former auditor for the Air Force.
[00:45:24.242 --> 00:45:26.383]  Yes, he was.
[00:45:26.523 --> 00:45:28.063]  Man, let me just stop you for a second.
[00:45:28.423 --> 00:45:29.583]  That's why it's a scam.
[00:45:29.603 --> 00:45:32.944]  Do you understand the difference between a budget and your total assets?
[00:45:33.304 --> 00:45:33.524]  Yes.
[00:45:34.525 --> 00:45:46.948]  I mean, let's say, Pat, you've got a million bucks in the bank, but you tell everybody, your family, your husband, that, oh, on the budget we've only got $1,000 this month, and so we go over budget, you can tell folks, oh, we're in debt now, you guys have got to work harder.
[00:45:47.677 --> 00:45:50.580]  So they tell you on paper, oh, the budget, we're in debt.
[00:45:50.861 --> 00:45:55.065]  Well, the budget is just all the things that they owe or things they have to spend.
[00:45:55.306 --> 00:45:57.568]  They don't talk about their real assets and holdings.
[00:45:57.608 --> 00:45:58.970]  And I'm not even talking about pension funds.
[00:45:59.230 --> 00:45:59.971]  That's on budget.
[00:46:01.523 --> 00:46:02.543]  And so, yes, it's true.
[00:46:03.344 --> 00:46:09.669]  Most of the stock market, most of the private corporations are in a symbiotic ownership relationship with government.
[00:46:09.989 --> 00:46:15.614]  There's giant federal, state, local surpluses, but you're not to be told about that.
[00:46:15.634 --> 00:46:20.618]  They're going to bankrupt government, take all services, and then make you pay almost everything you make.
[00:46:20.958 --> 00:46:26.543]  That is stealing your energy, because it's just zeros and ones in a computer, until they extract your energy with the payment.
[00:46:27.223 --> 00:46:32.850]  Yeah, when I showed this to Congressman Pence, he all of a sudden decided he had to go home and date it.
[00:46:47.782 --> 00:46:50.484]  And he told me to ask Senator Alan Paul these questions.
[00:46:51.224 --> 00:46:55.547]  Look, any congressman or senator knows all about comprehensive annual financial reports.
[00:46:55.747 --> 00:46:56.347]  No, they didn't.
[00:46:56.427 --> 00:46:59.529]  They didn't respond to my questions, but the other people did.
[00:46:59.849 --> 00:47:10.356]  Yeah, my film gets, my film on that subject, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed, gets into how all the big editors of newspapers and magazines, they all get it.
[00:47:10.756 --> 00:47:15.799]  It's the financial document they study for their own investments, but you'll never see a mention of it in the newspaper.
[00:47:17.392 --> 00:47:21.174]  I know, and he was supposed to have a town hall meeting, but he cancelled that.
[00:47:21.954 --> 00:47:23.655]  So I didn't get to go to that.
[00:47:23.675 --> 00:47:38.202]  Yeah, well, see what they do is, they have a stage meeting with a newspaper, a few select media people show up and they call it in the news, a town hall meeting that no one ever heard about, and then tell the people, everyone loves this, this is what the people decided at the town hall meeting.
[00:47:38.342 --> 00:47:43.144]  They're calling these secret Ashcroft meetings, where they don't ask the public, no one's allowed in.
[00:47:43.164 --> 00:47:44.505]  They're calling those debates.
[00:47:45.202 --> 00:47:52.309]  Well, when the last meeting that I went with Congressman Pence, there was a veteran there, a Second World War veteran.
[00:47:52.409 --> 00:47:58.615]  He asked the question, why are you taking our medical away from the veterans?
[00:47:58.695 --> 00:48:03.279]  He says, your promise was if I go lay my life on the line, it would protect me.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.221]  But he says, we're getting old.
[00:48:05.629 --> 00:48:09.531]  He said, well, my father told me to go back to Washington and make sure that didn't happen.
[00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:14.975]  But what he did, he went back to Washington and voted to take two more billion dollars away from these veterans.
[00:48:15.835 --> 00:48:17.176]  So we know where he stands.
[00:48:17.256 --> 00:48:20.038]  Oh yeah, and these yuppies are still in denial.
[00:48:20.078 --> 00:48:23.240]  They're cutting off almost all the health care of the vets because they're scum.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.421]  They're little neocons.
[00:48:24.741 --> 00:48:25.561]  They're just wrestling.
[00:48:25.601 --> 00:48:26.822]  Bob says that's not true.
[00:48:27.182 --> 00:48:27.923]  I love him.
[00:48:28.123 --> 00:48:29.104]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:29.204 --> 00:48:30.304]  I'm turning my guns in.
[00:48:31.773 --> 00:48:36.118]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:48:36.298 --> 00:48:40.723]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:48:40.883 --> 00:48:45.268]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:48:45.288 --> 00:48:46.650]  The New World Order.
[00:48:48.411 --> 00:48:52.656]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:48:52.716 --> 00:48:59.623]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:48:59.763 --> 00:49:01.785]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:49:02.145 --> 00:49:12.587]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:49:12.767 --> 00:49:18.168]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:49:18.648 --> 00:49:20.888]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:49:38.939 --> 00:49:49.851]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:49:50.111 --> 00:49:51.932]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:49:52.192 --> 00:49:55.514]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:49:55.854 --> 00:50:06.321]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:50:06.601 --> 00:50:07.101]  That's right!
[00:50:07.281 --> 00:50:14.405]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:50:14.706 --> 00:50:18.788]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter.

[00:50:26.691 --> 00:50:32.953]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:50:33.033 --> 00:50:35.554]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:50:35.714 --> 00:50:37.635]  It feels great, absolutely wonderful.
[00:50:37.715 --> 00:50:43.077]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:50:43.357 --> 00:50:45.158]  I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:50:45.298 --> 00:50:48.420]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.281]  Incredible!
[00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:50.702]  I'm really excited naturally.
[00:50:50.742 --> 00:50:54.424]  I have a 21 month old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:50:54.704 --> 00:50:58.206]  Sharon lost 28 pounds with collagen aid from Vim and Vigor.
[00:50:58.226 --> 00:51:05.031]  I have arthritis and I have a thyroid problem and blood pressure and Vim and Vigor has really been a blessing to me.
[00:51:05.331 --> 00:51:05.711]  I've lost
[00:51:06.091 --> 00:51:07.753]  28 pounds and counting.
[00:51:08.133 --> 00:51:11.035]  And I thank them very much from the bottom of my heart.
[00:51:11.416 --> 00:51:16.100]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.701]  Call right now 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:18.362]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:51:18.382 --> 00:51:19.563]  $25 off a three-month supply.

[00:51:21.805 --> 00:51:22.745]  Again that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:51:43.729 --> 00:51:46.811]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:51:48.292 --> 00:52:09.985]  I remember a few months ago when the federal court ruled, and I was reading the Associated Press on the air, that yes, veterans were told they'd get lifetime health coverage, but that all of that was going to be taken away, and that Ashcroft was arguing that the veterans don't get any health care, and that it doesn't matter if they were told that, that the policy was being changed.
[00:52:10.968 --> 00:52:17.093]  And I actually had a couple radio stations call and complain, that's not true, he's making stuff up.
[00:52:17.913 --> 00:52:20.876]  Now, later they actually called and apologized, as usual.
[00:52:21.736 --> 00:52:27.881]  It was like when I said that don't give money to the Red Cross or United Way for 9-1-1, it'll go to gun grabbers.
[00:52:28.401 --> 00:52:31.524]  They have a policy of giving a percentage to the gun grabbers.
[00:52:31.664 --> 00:52:33.525]  I didn't just pull that out of a hat, folks.
[00:52:33.605 --> 00:52:35.867]  Please, listen to me, we're losing this country!
[00:52:38.042 --> 00:52:39.624]  And now people have heard about it.
[00:52:39.644 --> 00:52:54.016]  I mean, I reported months ago, years ago, Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that they were going to, what was it, a year and a half ago, that Arizona was going to kill those German bank robbers that killed a bunch of people on surveillance tape at a bank robbery in Arizona.
[00:52:54.056 --> 00:52:55.838]  And Ginsburg said, we won't execute them.
[00:52:55.858 --> 00:52:58.620]  And we're sorry that they were executed.
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.461]  In the future, we won't.
[00:52:59.681 --> 00:53:00.502]  We know the U.N.
[00:53:00.542 --> 00:53:01.342]  is the authority.
[00:53:01.843 --> 00:53:03.224]  The criminal court is the authority.
[00:53:04.187 --> 00:53:05.567]  People couldn't believe that at the time.
[00:53:05.967 --> 00:53:10.429]  Now the Supreme Court stopped executions in Texas because of the U.N.
[00:53:10.489 --> 00:53:12.089]  That's not the news, though, by the way.
[00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:15.310]  I mean, it was in the back of some newspaper, but not a big national issue.
[00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:18.891]  Now we're all hearing that in the sodomy case, they used the U.N.
[00:53:18.951 --> 00:53:19.731]  court for that.
[00:53:20.751 --> 00:53:21.091]  See?
[00:53:21.591 --> 00:53:21.831]  See?
[00:53:21.851 --> 00:53:23.352]  We're under New World Order, folks!
[00:53:23.852 --> 00:53:27.333]  But I heard neocons yesterday bringing this up and going, Bush is fighting that!
[00:53:27.453 --> 00:53:28.733]  Bush is standing up against that!
[00:53:28.753 --> 00:53:30.533]  That's why we gotta be Republicans!
[00:53:30.893 --> 00:53:33.074]  It's a Republican court that's doing it!
[00:53:34.088 --> 00:53:43.495]  See, that's their little trick, is they'll come in and tell the truth about the bad things that are happening, but say George Bush is fighting it, when George Bush is their top agent!
[00:53:44.916 --> 00:53:46.578]  By that, their top figurehead!
[00:53:47.899 --> 00:53:49.300]  That's what makes me so mad.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.581]  I just... Oh, man, I tell you.
[00:53:52.002 --> 00:53:55.204]  Coming up, public little concern about Patriot Act.
[00:53:55.224 --> 00:53:56.105]  That's the Gallup poll.
[00:53:57.385 --> 00:53:58.406]  Little concern.
[00:53:58.706 --> 00:53:59.447]  Oh, yeah.
[00:53:59.847 --> 00:54:00.927]  I mean, can you believe this?
[00:54:01.348 --> 00:54:01.868]  Here's another one.
[00:54:01.948 --> 00:54:06.611]  U.S.-backed Mossad agents involved in Hakeem's assassination flee Iraq.
[00:54:08.072 --> 00:54:08.552]  Another one.
[00:54:10.934 --> 00:54:13.536]  Fires provide backdrop for Bush's message.
[00:54:13.616 --> 00:54:17.038]  Tree thinning is the way, and now is the time, President says.
[00:54:17.198 --> 00:54:21.161]  Registered Guard admitting that there were fires and black helicopters.
[00:54:21.341 --> 00:54:23.102]  Mainstream news, folks, right before he got there.
[00:54:23.806 --> 00:54:25.968]  Singapore confirms new case of SARS.
[00:54:26.628 --> 00:54:27.089]  Five U.S.
[00:54:27.129 --> 00:54:28.850]  soldiers wounded in Iraq attacks.
[00:54:29.671 --> 00:54:31.633]  North Korea to display new missiles.
[00:54:32.513 --> 00:54:34.895]  Iraq may have been telling the truth about weapons.
[00:54:35.636 --> 00:54:38.238]  Spy agencies warned of Iraq resistance beforehand.
[00:54:39.339 --> 00:54:42.481]  Flyers should be rated by risk level color coding.
[00:54:42.521 --> 00:54:45.904]  I told you two years ago, almost two years ago, I saw Ridge talk about this.
[00:54:47.145 --> 00:54:49.928]  78% of Bush's post-war spending plan for the military.
[00:54:50.748 --> 00:54:52.690]  Reserve tours are extended.
[00:54:53.766 --> 00:54:58.709]  Arnold Schwarzenegger ran in a public meeting screaming, I hate black people, inward, inward, inward.
[00:54:59.069 --> 00:55:01.390]  But still, the neocons love him, the liberals won't talk about it.
[00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:03.091]  That's all coming up.
[00:55:03.451 --> 00:55:08.153]  Just believe me, you'll want to stay with us, and we'll get to your calls directly when we start the next hour.
[00:55:08.674 --> 00:55:09.174]  I promise.
[00:55:10.379 --> 00:55:14.981]  Before I end this hour, I might spend 60 seconds, I guess, plugging my videos and great books.
[00:55:15.601 --> 00:55:16.842]  I've written Dissent and Deterrenty.
[00:55:16.862 --> 00:55:18.823]  Paul Watson's written Ordered Out of Chaos.
[00:55:19.123 --> 00:55:20.744]  Both about government-sponsored terror.
[00:55:21.164 --> 00:55:21.784]  Hope you get them.
[00:55:22.244 --> 00:55:24.425]  My new film is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:55:24.505 --> 00:55:25.806]  It is an amazing film.
[00:55:27.107 --> 00:55:29.888]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:30.623 --> 00:55:31.544]  And get the videos.
[00:55:31.584 --> 00:55:32.224]  Get the books.
[00:55:32.365 --> 00:55:32.685]  Get them.
[00:55:32.705 --> 00:55:33.485]  Get them out to folks.
[00:55:33.525 --> 00:55:34.386]  Wake America up.
[00:55:34.726 --> 00:55:39.911]  Stand up, like Sholts and Nietzsche said in the Information War, before it gets physical.
[00:55:40.311 --> 00:55:42.453]  We're trying to avert that, desperately.
[00:55:43.314 --> 00:55:44.595]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:44.615 --> 00:55:45.816]  Don't wait.
[00:55:45.836 --> 00:55:46.536]  Get the videos.
[00:55:46.556 --> 00:55:46.616]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:02.396 --> 00:56:04.918]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[00:56:04.938 --> 00:56:13.783]  By the way, there's a bunch of new stuff on the government, the CIA running the touch screen companies for the voting.
[00:56:14.343 --> 00:56:15.124]  Mainstream news.
[00:56:15.944 --> 00:56:16.825]  That's coming up too.
[00:56:16.925 --> 00:56:18.506]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:56:18.546 --> 00:56:19.046]  Stay with us.
[00:56:21.565 --> 00:56:24.849]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:56:24.969 --> 00:56:29.213]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:56:29.473 --> 00:56:32.316]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:56:36.441 --> 00:56:39.624]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.148 --> 00:56:47.789]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.449 --> 00:56:49.490]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:51.331]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:52.792]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.552 --> 00:56:54.473]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.113 --> 00:56:58.856]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.296 --> 00:57:03.419]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:11.885 --> 00:57:14.927]  Oh boy, I had a schedule right now.
[00:57:15.811 --> 00:57:18.514]  And I had all the news articles, and I've got to go dig them out.
[00:57:18.534 --> 00:57:19.535]  They may be in my truck.
[00:57:20.776 --> 00:57:23.238]  And I didn't know that we had him coming on.
[00:57:24.279 --> 00:57:29.864]  The father of the woman who's begging for food audibly, and they're going to pull her feeding tube out.
[00:57:30.324 --> 00:57:32.987]  I read the news articles on this last Friday.
[00:57:33.988 --> 00:57:36.690]  And I can't just come on, I guess, and make up the details of it.
[00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:37.831]  I need the actual news articles.
[00:57:38.272 --> 00:57:41.475]  But I'm going to try to reschedule that and dig the articles out and have them on in the next hour.
[00:57:43.619 --> 00:57:44.660]  So that's coming up.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:45.621]  Stuff's just crazy.
[00:57:45.641 --> 00:57:49.885]  There's so much information coming at us from so many, so many different angles.
[00:57:52.568 --> 00:57:57.073]  I know we got loaded phones as well and just so much, just out of control tyranny.
[00:57:57.093 --> 00:57:59.775]  We're just going to have to cover it all at light speed.
[00:57:59.795 --> 00:58:00.977]  Let's go to these calls quickly.
[00:58:01.397 --> 00:58:02.738]  Rodney in Texas.
[00:58:02.818 --> 00:58:03.379]  You're on the air.
[00:58:03.399 --> 00:58:03.779]  Go ahead.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:06.282]  Hey Alex, help me out on something here.
[00:58:06.972 --> 00:58:12.735]  I was talking with a talk show host, one of your 50,000 watch stations in St.
[00:58:12.775 --> 00:58:35.609]  Louis, and he was saying, you know, when 9-11 hit and those buildings fell down, he said, you know, I'm still trying, meaning himself, he said he was still scratching his head trying to figure out how did those buildings fall down, straight down, and some joker called into the radio station and claimed that he was
[00:58:36.716 --> 00:58:49.567]  Uh, some type of engineer and he claimed, well, it was, uh, the, uh, card effect, you know, playing cards, you know, how you make, uh, that card about out of playing cards.
[00:58:49.927 --> 00:58:50.127]  Yeah.
[00:58:50.147 --> 00:59:00.056]  They had a Emmy award winning propaganda piece on PBS, why the towers fell, uh, because they knew this was an important point for everybody.
[00:59:00.076 --> 00:59:01.257]  They had to propagandize this.
[00:59:02.017 --> 00:59:04.960]  Uh, but we have the diagrams for the building top.
[00:59:06.258 --> 00:59:07.439]  Architects have looked at it.
[00:59:07.999 --> 00:59:12.581]  Firefighter engineering, the oldest firefighter organization in the country says it's a lie and a cover-up.
[00:59:13.402 --> 00:59:20.305]  The federal report came out two weeks ago and said that no, that is not what happened.
[00:59:20.345 --> 00:59:22.106]  They can't say why it fell.
[00:59:22.546 --> 00:59:25.588]  Now interesting, why would the feds come out and have to admit that?
[00:59:25.648 --> 00:59:27.169]  Because it would be even more
[00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:32.103]  Revealing if they came out and lied and said and brought up false science.
[00:59:32.723 --> 00:59:35.164]  Now I'd like to ask them why building 7 fell.
[00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:37.386]  That was my question.
[00:59:37.406 --> 00:59:43.128]  44 story building 6 hours later implodes faster than a bowling ball can fall.
[00:59:43.388 --> 00:59:48.591]  That's because it was pulverized with high powered explosives.
[00:59:48.971 --> 00:59:50.673]  But here was his response.
[00:59:51.013 --> 00:59:51.774]  His response.
[00:59:51.794 --> 00:59:52.594]  Oh, some idiot caller?
[00:59:52.655 --> 00:59:53.455]  Okay, let's talk about it.
[00:59:53.475 --> 00:59:54.817]  Yeah, the engineer's claims.
[00:59:54.897 --> 00:59:56.898]  Now he's an engineer because he called in?
[00:59:56.918 --> 00:59:57.539]  Okay.
[00:59:57.579 --> 00:59:59.040]  Yeah, this was his claim.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:13.794]  He says, well, you know, the shockwave and I... Now, by this time, they had cut me off, but I wanted to call back and say, well, there were other buildings closer to the other, you know, the Twin Towers, wasn't it?
[01:00:15.186 --> 01:00:15.888]  I don't
[01:00:28.979 --> 01:00:31.641]  Why didn't the shockwave cause those other buildings?
[01:00:31.681 --> 01:00:32.181]  You know what?
[01:00:32.221 --> 01:00:35.383]  At this point, if folks want to be total slaves, they can believe the official story.
[01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:40.225]  The German technology minister came out and said, the U.S.
[01:00:40.305 --> 01:00:46.749]  government, controlled by a private elite, for a new world order, remote-controlled the aircraft into the buildings.
[01:00:46.889 --> 01:00:50.911]  It is impossible for even top pilots to do that.
[01:00:51.051 --> 01:00:52.652]  Okay, now that's paraphrasing his quote.
[01:00:52.992 --> 01:00:53.593]  I agree with you.
[01:00:53.613 --> 01:00:55.454]  Well, no, I mean, that was in major German papers.
[01:00:56.614 --> 01:00:59.056]  I got it with a 170-something IQ, said it.
[01:01:00.217 --> 01:01:04.339]  Again, I've had to make two films and write a book just to cover the bare details of it.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.961]  From every angle, there's no way that happened.
[01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:08.742]  It's a complete joke, sir.
[01:01:08.822 --> 01:01:09.443]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:10.043 --> 01:01:17.128]  It is a complete, sickening joke, but they know how dumb we are, on average, so they sit there and they do it, right out in the open.
[01:01:19.229 --> 01:01:23.052]  Folks, NORAD stood down for over an hour and 15 minutes.
[01:01:23.992 --> 01:01:24.993]  Stood down!
[01:01:26.485 --> 01:01:34.619]  It now comes out that from the time the planes were hijacked, the White House was on the phone with NORAD.
[01:01:36.322 --> 01:01:39.227]  Do you understand?
[01:01:42.552 --> 01:01:46.879]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:01:47.059 --> 01:01:51.506]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:01:51.646 --> 01:01:56.033]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:01:56.073 --> 01:01:57.415]  The New World Order.
[01:01:59.187 --> 01:02:03.411]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:02:03.471 --> 01:02:10.397]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:02:10.537 --> 01:02:12.619]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:02:12.899 --> 01:02:23.248]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:02:24.209 --> 01:02:24.409]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:02:24.429 --> 01:02:25.310]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:46.801]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.

[01:03:41.832 --> 01:03:45.294]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:03:45.574 --> 01:03:49.075]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:03:49.155 --> 01:03:53.097]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:03:53.337 --> 01:03:59.500]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:07.804]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:04:08.224 --> 01:04:13.569]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:04:13.729 --> 01:04:17.492]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:04:38.609 --> 01:04:39.949]  Protect your family.
[01:04:47.192 --> 01:04:47.852]  Big Brother.
[01:04:48.512 --> 01:04:49.592]  Mainstream media.
[01:04:50.272 --> 01:04:51.433]  Government cover-ups.
[01:04:51.453 --> 01:04:52.893]  You want answers?
[01:04:53.613 --> 01:04:54.554]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:55.174 --> 01:04:58.835]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:59.355 --> 01:05:03.416]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:11.285]  Alright folks, we're back live Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day.
[01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:15.687]  And then of course, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, I do this show live.
[01:05:16.688 --> 01:05:21.951]  We go out on the AM and FM dials, simulcast at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:05:23.251 --> 01:05:25.813]  And also on Global Shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 9320.
[01:05:25.973 --> 01:05:27.253]  And from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 6890.
[01:05:36.014 --> 01:05:44.258]  And I'm about to go back to your calls, but let me just go into some of the news first, and then I'll get back to your calls.
[01:05:45.298 --> 01:05:50.861]  It's a lot of interesting headlines that have absolutely got to be covered today.
[01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:54.303]  Singapore confirms it has a new case of SARS.
[01:05:54.663 --> 01:05:54.743]  Oh!
[01:05:55.652 --> 01:06:01.113]  Now they've got to train us to have a militarized health department take over our lives and lock down our cities.
[01:06:01.254 --> 01:06:02.674]  Just lots of threats like that.
[01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:06.795]  Singapore on Tuesday confirmed its first case of SARS in four months.
[01:06:07.295 --> 01:06:15.377]  A further test on a 27-year-old Chinese laboratory technician suspected of contracting the deadly virus proved positive.
[01:06:15.397 --> 01:06:17.518]  And it started last year.
[01:06:19.494 --> 01:06:24.497]  And then earlier into this year, in Chinese laboratories.
[01:06:24.617 --> 01:06:25.238]  Hmm, interesting.
[01:06:25.918 --> 01:06:37.385]  The man is being isolated at the City-States-Tan-Toc-Sing Hospital, which has been designed, designated as the center for future SARS treatments.
[01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:39.147]  Boy, five U.S.
[01:06:39.207 --> 01:06:41.128]  soldiers wounded in Iraq attacks.
[01:06:42.188 --> 01:06:50.255]  Two soldiers were wounded in an attack using an explosive device in the town of Ramadi, around 60 miles west of Baghdad at 7 a.m.
[01:06:50.896 --> 01:06:51.777]  Baghdad time.
[01:06:52.758 --> 01:07:01.325]  A spokesman said, without giving further details of the incident, nearly three hours later, three soldiers were wounded when their vehicle was attacked in Falljala.
[01:07:02.366 --> 01:07:06.290]  Witnesses in the town 30 miles west of the capital said a landmine hit the U.S.
[01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:07.451]  military convoy.
[01:07:08.903 --> 01:07:14.825]  Residents gathered near the scene chanting anti-American slogans such as, burn, burn, you infidels.
[01:07:15.826 --> 01:07:22.068]  Now, again, the Iraqi people love the government, the occupation government.
[01:07:22.168 --> 01:07:25.769]  These are all mind-control slaves of Saddam.
[01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:27.790]  These are all slaves of Saddam.
[01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:36.374]  It doesn't matter if the government's own report that they're trying to suppress says that the longer we stay, the more hatred there'll be, which I don't understand.
[01:07:36.414 --> 01:07:37.474]  What's wrong with this scum?
[01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:44.328]  Don't they love being hit with thousands and thousands of pounds of DU and having their water treatment and power plants blown up?
[01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:47.350]  And their kids machine-gunned?
[01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:48.891]  I mean, what's wrong with this trash?
[01:07:48.911 --> 01:07:52.294]  What's wrong with them?
[01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:55.656]  And you know, there's a lot of people like Schwarzkopf who were against this war.
[01:07:55.716 --> 01:07:56.417]  How dare him?
[01:07:57.137 --> 01:07:58.458]  A lot of people, folks.
[01:07:58.879 --> 01:08:01.280]  Like the Secretary of the Army, appointed by Bush.
[01:08:02.361 --> 01:08:05.864]  That evil demon was against the war and said it would be a bloodbath for our troops.
[01:08:06.812 --> 01:08:16.157]  The former head of the Army, biological and radiological team, Captain Rook, who said this was deadly and is hurting the troops.
[01:08:16.217 --> 01:08:17.917]  How dare him say DU is bad for him?
[01:08:18.418 --> 01:08:19.678]  How dare a scientist say that?
[01:08:19.958 --> 01:08:20.719]  Hired by the U.S.
[01:08:20.759 --> 01:08:21.079]  government.
[01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:22.280]  They're all traitors!
[01:08:24.141 --> 01:08:24.841]  They're all traitors.
[01:08:25.561 --> 01:08:27.722]  I'm for this war, and I hope it goes on.
[01:08:27.922 --> 01:08:31.724]  I hope we go to war with Iran, and Syria, and China, and North Korea.
[01:08:31.784 --> 01:08:33.045]  I love national drafts.
[01:08:34.426 --> 01:08:34.886]  And guess what?
[01:08:34.926 --> 01:08:35.807]  I love NAFTA and GAFTA.
[01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:37.227]  I love all the factories shutting down.
[01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:39.768]  And all the high-tech people laughed during that period.
[01:08:39.808 --> 01:08:40.648]  I remember five years ago.
[01:08:40.708 --> 01:08:41.389]  Ha ha ha!
[01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:43.169]  Well, high-tech's got its job.
[01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:44.790]  Now you're losing your jobs to India?
[01:08:45.690 --> 01:08:47.491]  And they say it's going to get seven times worse?
[01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:48.291]  You think it's bad now?
[01:08:48.712 --> 01:08:49.232]  Well, okay.
[01:08:49.272 --> 01:08:50.112]  You were laughing then.
[01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:50.993]  This is great now.
[01:08:51.053 --> 01:08:51.653]  I think it's great.
[01:08:53.413 --> 01:08:55.954]  And, uh, you're laughing about the draft?
[01:08:56.155 --> 01:08:57.975]  Oh, well, it's going to be for high-tech people.
[01:08:58.055 --> 01:08:59.276]  Doctors and professionals.
[01:08:59.396 --> 01:08:59.956]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:01.076 --> 01:09:02.297]  Oh, yeah!
[01:09:03.813 --> 01:09:06.755]  Oh, they're getting World War III set up and you're all going to get to go over there.
[01:09:07.415 --> 01:09:08.416]  Maybe I will too!
[01:09:09.977 --> 01:09:13.339]  And so we can all be fat-bellied yuppies now, can't we?
[01:09:13.959 --> 01:09:14.880]  So again, I'm for the war.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.621]  I'm for President Bush, because he's a conservative.
[01:09:18.502 --> 01:09:21.443]  I support him protecting Bill Clinton on Pardon Gate.
[01:09:21.543 --> 01:09:23.985]  I support him for blanket total amnesty.
[01:09:24.225 --> 01:09:27.627]  I support him for blocking arming the pilots to this day.
[01:09:28.387 --> 01:09:30.909]  I support him saying he'll sign the Assault Weapons Ban.
[01:09:31.494 --> 01:09:33.195]  Because I'm a dirty neocon!
[01:09:34.356 --> 01:09:35.237]  Now, now see?
[01:09:35.277 --> 01:09:37.779]  You can put me on 500 radio stations!
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:39.921]  See how that works?
[01:09:42.423 --> 01:09:44.324]  North Korea to display new missiles.
[01:09:44.405 --> 01:09:49.969]  North Korea is expected to display, as early as today, one or two new long-range missiles.
[01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:51.831]  Oh, they can't just hit the West Coast now.
[01:09:53.052 --> 01:09:56.274]  Including a system capable of hitting the Western United States, U.S.
[01:09:56.314 --> 01:09:57.155]  officials said Wednesday.
[01:09:58.251 --> 01:09:59.332]  I said yesterday, excuse me.
[01:09:59.852 --> 01:10:05.314]  One new missile is believed to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a range of up to several thousand miles.
[01:10:05.354 --> 01:10:16.879]  A second missile, which could be shown during a military parade today in the North Korean capital, is a new version of the Taepung Dong-2 intercontinental ballistic missile, said administration officials with access to intelligence reports.
[01:10:17.499 --> 01:10:21.381]  Yeah, and Clinton authorized the transfer of that to them through China.
[01:10:22.068 --> 01:10:23.289]  And you say, oh, that dirty Clinton.
[01:10:23.309 --> 01:10:24.169]  Yes, he is a dirty Clinton.
[01:10:24.749 --> 01:10:36.394]  But it's really okay, because Rumsfeld was the guy allowing it and working on the nuclear reactors for the fissile material, and Laurel and Hughes are Republican-controlled, and they were transferring the actual goodies.
[01:10:36.474 --> 01:10:41.316]  So, actually, we can't be against Clinton now, because the neocons did the actual handoff.
[01:10:43.596 --> 01:10:44.337]  Isn't that nice?
[01:10:44.977 --> 01:10:45.677]  So I'm for it.
[01:10:45.737 --> 01:10:46.357]  I think it's good.
[01:10:47.478 --> 01:10:50.059]  Iraq may have been telling the truth.
[01:10:50.865 --> 01:10:51.705]  I'm on weapons.
[01:10:52.906 --> 01:10:54.046]  That's from ABC News.
[01:10:54.126 --> 01:10:55.646]  Well, it doesn't really matter.
[01:10:56.467 --> 01:11:00.108]  Spy agencies warned of Iraq resistance and it says the U.S.
[01:11:00.148 --> 01:11:02.228]  military casualties mount resistance forces.
[01:11:02.948 --> 01:11:03.708]  You mean the terrorists.
[01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:08.830]  Why did you campaign of targeted bombings in Iraq?
[01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:12.951]  Some administration officials have begun to fault the CIA and other intelligence agencies for being
[01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:18.831]  Overtly optimistic and failing to anticipate such widespread and sustained opposition to U.S.
[01:11:18.891 --> 01:11:19.451]  occupation.
[01:11:19.852 --> 01:11:24.253]  But several administration and congressional sources interviewed for the article said the opposition occurred.
[01:11:24.674 --> 01:11:33.077]  They said senior policy makers at the White House, Pentagon, and elsewhere perceived classified analysis before the war warning about dangers of the post-war period.
[01:11:34.201 --> 01:11:49.176]  This is among these threats outlined in the intelligence agency's reporting was the Iraqis probably would resort to obstruction resistance in armed opposition if they perceived attempts to keep them dependent on US and the West, one senior congressional aide said.
[01:11:50.917 --> 01:11:52.579]  Well, how dare the Iraqis?
[01:11:52.659 --> 01:11:56.603]  I mean, I think when foreign troops occupy us, which they say is going to happen as part of a
[01:11:58.186 --> 01:12:09.771]  Stabilization force after major terrorist attacks, they say will happen, quote a multinational UNECO force, when they're taking your guns and relocating you, anybody that doesn't submit is going to be a terrorist!
[01:12:12.072 --> 01:12:14.333]  So what if they're going to be slaves in Iraq?
[01:12:14.633 --> 01:12:15.673]  It's for their own good!
[01:12:18.074 --> 01:12:23.777]  So what if they were for the takeover at first, believing the stories the government told them?
[01:12:24.337 --> 01:12:26.478]  How dare them now criticize it and fight?
[01:12:28.817 --> 01:12:35.599]  I mean, being slaughtered and occupied and breathing uranium and being forcibly injected and getting $20 a month to have any job in the country.
[01:12:36.199 --> 01:12:37.540]  I mean, that sounds like freedom to me.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.180]  I need to stop being sarcastic.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.461]  I've got to go to calls here in a second.
[01:12:42.901 --> 01:12:46.482]  This is out of the Washington Post right now on Infowars.com.
[01:12:46.942 --> 01:12:50.304]  Flyers to be rated for risk level.
[01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:53.364]  New system will scrutinize each passenger.
[01:12:53.805 --> 01:12:55.085]  Assign color code.
[01:12:55.996 --> 01:13:09.305]  The most aggressive and some say invasive step yet to protect air travelers, the federal government and airlines will phase in a computer system next year to measure the risk posed by every passenger on every flight in the United States.
[01:13:09.765 --> 01:13:14.789]  The new Transportation Security Administration system seeks to probe deeper into each passenger's identity
[01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:21.072]  Then it is currently possible comparing personal information against criminal records and intelligence information.
[01:13:21.132 --> 01:13:30.597]  Passengers will be assigned a color code, green, yellow, or red, based in part on their city of departure, destination, traveling, companions, and date of ticket purchase.
[01:13:31.818 --> 01:13:33.299]  And it's called CAPS 2.
[01:13:33.339 --> 01:13:34.079]  You may have heard about it.
[01:13:34.119 --> 01:13:35.340]  We talked about it a couple years ago.
[01:13:36.741 --> 01:13:38.022]  And I've seen Rich.
[01:13:38.102 --> 01:13:44.265]  I have him on tape, on C-SPAN, in a two-hour meeting, saying to have a job anywhere.
[01:13:44.918 --> 01:14:00.153]  Your ID card, your driver's license, which is a federal ID card, will have on it, and by the way, six, seven years ago, most state driver's licenses already had this section, this data code on it, to have this information added.
[01:14:00.273 --> 01:14:03.536]  Understand, this was already set up beforehand, before all the convenience error.
[01:14:04.597 --> 01:14:06.979]  You're going to have four levels of coding.
[01:14:07.802 --> 01:14:08.463]  Color coding.
[01:14:08.923 --> 01:14:11.005]  To what job you can have, where you can work.
[01:14:11.445 --> 01:14:14.388]  I mean, you talk about the Soviet Union, folks, this is worse.
[01:14:15.969 --> 01:14:20.513]  But illegal aliens will get double the tuition, and any fake ID known as matricula will be accepted.
[01:14:21.193 --> 01:14:30.901]  But as a citizen, you're gonna learn, boy, about what it's like living on the plantation, the reservation, the company stow.
[01:14:32.002 --> 01:14:35.045]  I owe my soul to the company store.
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:37.501]  And I told you they were going to start it!
[01:14:38.021 --> 01:14:49.531]  First, through with your driver's license or ID card at the airlines and now they admit, oh it's going to be in factories or in food service or in agriculture or in retail.
[01:14:50.271 --> 01:14:50.992]  Everywhere!
[01:14:51.072 --> 01:14:52.313]  They're going to do it!
[01:14:52.433 --> 01:14:53.974]  They've announced it!
[01:14:54.875 --> 01:14:59.239]  Imagine having your multi-pass just like in The Running Man.
[01:15:00.039 --> 01:15:03.262]  Anyone caught out after dark will be permanently detained.
[01:15:04.108 --> 01:15:23.442]  Did you know that the head of FEMA in New Jersey, in Gannett News Service, the articles on my websites, and it's also in the film Police Day 3, big blow-ups of Gannett News Service, we zoom in on the text, leave your home, you'll be considered an enemy combatant, you may be shot on sight!
[01:15:23.882 --> 01:15:26.444]  Why, they didn't just shoot you on sight in 1984!
[01:15:26.644 --> 01:15:29.506]  You've got a little more!
[01:15:29.987 --> 01:15:32.769]  New process at the Ministry of Love!
[01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:36.233]  I got Ridge on tape.
[01:15:37.173 --> 01:15:51.979]  I got, let me say it again, I got Ridge on tape saying that to have a job anywhere, you're going to have different levels on your card.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.140]  Anywhere!
[01:15:55.561 --> 01:16:02.544]  Everything you do, tract and traction, when you pay for anything, they're already getting you ready for it with paint, cigarette, beer,
[01:16:04.452 --> 01:16:07.114]  Now they say it's going to be with fast food, sugar drinks.
[01:16:07.294 --> 01:16:09.236]  You have to swipe your car, because there's a tax.
[01:16:09.276 --> 01:16:11.458]  There's going to be a special fat tax added.
[01:16:11.678 --> 01:16:13.819]  That's just to warm you up for it, folks.
[01:16:15.661 --> 01:16:17.082]  See, put some class in me.
[01:16:17.442 --> 01:16:28.571]  Oh, there's going to be satellite tracker boxes in your cars, but if you have a little Pinto hybrid car, a little modern Gremlin, you won't pay as much in the satellite tracker box.
[01:16:28.631 --> 01:16:31.433]  But if you've got one of those big evil SUVs, see,
[01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:33.284]  Total control.
[01:16:33.505 --> 01:16:36.589]  Everything you do is micromanaged by hateful bureaucrats.
[01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:41.316]  And if you don't do what they say, men in black ski masks will blow your head off.
[01:16:42.501 --> 01:16:43.441]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.

[01:17:42.569 --> 01:17:45.850]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:50.212]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:17:50.472 --> 01:17:53.353]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:17:53.533 --> 01:17:55.954]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:17:56.134 --> 01:18:04.858]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:18:05.078 --> 01:18:06.458]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:18:06.658 --> 01:18:11.040]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:11.640]  I think?
[01:18:30.746 --> 01:18:32.408]  Screams and stagnant ponds.

[01:18:42.774 --> 01:18:46.677]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:18:46.897 --> 01:18:59.187]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:18:59.607 --> 01:19:00.007]  The U.S.
[01:19:00.067 --> 01:19:05.652]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:06.032 --> 01:19:08.254]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:10.115 --> 01:19:11.156]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:19:11.196 --> 01:19:14.039]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:19:14.159 --> 01:19:20.185]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:23.969]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[01:20:46.785 --> 01:20:50.869]  Face the facts, folks.
[01:20:50.889 --> 01:21:01.918]  We were all brought up knowing people were numbered and tracked and traced to have jobs in Russia, that goons in black uniforms could arrest anyone whenever they felt like it.
[01:21:03.519 --> 01:21:06.461]  And then you look at everything they're setting up here today, it's worse.
[01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:10.925]  The box, the cage, what they're doing is bigger and better.
[01:21:11.465 --> 01:21:12.246]  We're America.
[01:21:13.439 --> 01:21:18.583]  And frankly, it's run by the same dirty bankers that created the Hitlers and the Stalins, and I'm sick of it.
[01:21:18.883 --> 01:21:20.945]  And we're not going down like those other countries.
[01:21:21.365 --> 01:21:22.566]  We're not putting up with it.
[01:21:23.286 --> 01:21:29.691]  And all the punks that are in this system, that are rationalizing what they're doing, and they're going to go along with this system.
[01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:31.893]  You don't have to worry about Alex Jones.
[01:21:31.913 --> 01:21:37.677]  Your own system, your own bosses, are going to chew you up and spit you out.
[01:21:37.997 --> 01:21:39.098]  I feel sorry for you.
[01:21:39.198 --> 01:21:40.079]  I pray for you.
[01:21:40.805 --> 01:21:46.153]  Because you've got God to deal with and the law of God's nature that you reap what you sow.
[01:21:46.773 --> 01:21:49.417]  Yeah, you're on this big wide highway to hell, aren't ya?
[01:21:49.998 --> 01:21:52.461]  It's so easy to go along with the tyranny.
[01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:54.925]  It's so easy to be sociopathic!
[01:21:56.027 --> 01:21:57.708]  And I'm talking to all the dirty yuppies.
[01:21:57.728 --> 01:21:59.109]  You're worse than the SWAT teams.
[01:21:59.690 --> 01:22:03.793]  You're worse than the FBI and the federal goons that at least have chosen a side.
[01:22:04.334 --> 01:22:06.795]  I'm talking to the lukewarm trash out there.
[01:22:07.056 --> 01:22:08.217]  You make me sick!
[01:22:08.577 --> 01:22:12.059]  I love this country, and I can't stand watching it be destroyed!
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.361]  I can't stand it!
[01:22:16.663 --> 01:22:22.227]  Let's talk to... Let's talk to Kevin in New York, and then we'll go to Mark and John and Spencer and Manuel and others.
[01:22:22.267 --> 01:22:23.028]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[01:22:23.348 --> 01:22:23.909]  Oh, Alex.
[01:22:25.157 --> 01:22:25.417]  Hello.
[01:22:25.477 --> 01:22:26.718]  Hello, Alex?
[01:22:26.999 --> 01:22:27.319]  Yes!
[01:22:28.199 --> 01:22:35.065]  I just want to tell you that my county I belong to passed the Patriot Act resolution.
[01:22:35.385 --> 01:22:35.805]  Good!
[01:22:36.166 --> 01:22:45.193]  With an amendment to review and repeal certain sections.
[01:22:45.333 --> 01:22:47.655]  All they gotta say is we support the Bill of Rights.
[01:22:47.795 --> 01:22:49.056]  Yeah.
[01:22:49.136 --> 01:22:51.118]  And the Bill of Rights will be enforced in this county.
[01:22:51.358 --> 01:22:51.538]  Yeah.
[01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:59.455]  It says, review, examine, and propose amendments or repeal portions that restrict or infringe upon civil rights.
[01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:00.375]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:23:00.395 --> 01:23:05.276]  I have been on over a thousand radio interviews since 9-1-1.
[01:23:05.376 --> 01:23:08.917]  And there might be one out of thirty people that likes the Patriot Act or all this tyranny.
[01:23:09.537 --> 01:23:11.198]  And I've been on liberal, conservative shows.
[01:23:11.258 --> 01:23:14.139]  Shows where the host is attacking me, the callers all call in and agree.
[01:23:14.599 --> 01:23:15.599]  Because they found out what's in it.
[01:23:15.619 --> 01:23:16.179]  But listen to this.
[01:23:16.919 --> 01:23:18.280]  The Gallup Organization.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:19.740]  The Zogby's a lot better, folks.
[01:23:21.164 --> 01:23:21.905]  Well, they probably would be.
[01:23:51.917 --> 01:23:54.079]  I didn't get it all there, I'll check it for a minute.
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:55.160]  No, don't.
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:55.741]  Yeah, this time, yeah.
[01:23:55.761 --> 01:23:57.642]  I can't right now, I can't.
[01:23:57.682 --> 01:23:57.983]  Yeah.
[01:24:14.522 --> 01:24:16.523]  No, they're trying to sugar coat things like that.
[01:24:16.703 --> 01:24:17.343]  Well, I know this.
[01:24:17.383 --> 01:24:23.864]  The news has been announcing for four months that it's 144 cities and counties that have passed the law against the Patriot Act.
[01:24:24.285 --> 01:24:25.505]  Months ago, it was over 400.
[01:24:27.445 --> 01:24:31.186]  They're still saying one state when it's now four states.
[01:24:32.247 --> 01:24:32.467]  Yeah.
[01:24:33.007 --> 01:24:34.207]  Well, it's all good news then.
[01:24:34.767 --> 01:24:35.247]  It is, sir.
[01:24:35.287 --> 01:24:35.908]  God bless you.
[01:24:36.528 --> 01:24:37.368]  Good to hear from you.
[01:24:38.041 --> 01:24:39.502]  Let's talk to Mark in Minnesota.
[01:24:39.522 --> 01:24:39.902]  Go ahead.
[01:24:39.922 --> 01:24:41.183]  Or Mark in Michigan.
[01:24:41.203 --> 01:24:41.624]  Go ahead.
[01:24:41.764 --> 01:24:41.944]  Yes.
[01:24:42.484 --> 01:24:42.705]  Alex?
[01:24:43.025 --> 01:24:43.265]  Yes.
[01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:43.825]  Hi.
[01:24:44.166 --> 01:24:45.327]  This is Mark from Michigan.
[01:24:46.488 --> 01:24:54.293]  And there was an example of the militarization of the police this weekend at an art show in a suburb north of Detroit.
[01:24:55.094 --> 01:24:55.795]  Oh, an art show.
[01:24:55.815 --> 01:24:56.555]  Gotta watch them.
[01:24:56.575 --> 01:25:05.282]  They basically had the Oakland County Sheriff out in their desert storm type camouflage uniform.
[01:25:05.342 --> 01:25:06.183]  It's marching around
[01:25:07.668 --> 01:25:20.437]  I think they had some of their juvenile delinquents that they use as a boot camp program out picking up trash, but nonetheless it was just still getting people acclimated to seeing the police in military uniforms.
[01:25:20.637 --> 01:25:21.738]  It's an admitted statement.
[01:25:21.878 --> 01:25:22.979]  Get us used to seeing it.
[01:25:23.379 --> 01:25:26.862]  I've got Army reports, Army War College, quote, acclimate the public.
[01:25:27.475 --> 01:25:30.097]  To the integration of the military into American society.
[01:25:30.537 --> 01:25:41.043]  Governor Ridge says, the official news reports say, they are going to have armed troops in uniform in factories overseeing you with machine guns.
[01:25:42.224 --> 01:25:45.025]  It doesn't get any more Russia than that, Buggs!
[01:25:45.506 --> 01:25:50.709]  Yeah, they were marching around with their boots fit shined and looking just military.
[01:25:51.409 --> 01:25:53.490]  I don't think a lot of people have been to third world countries.
[01:25:53.530 --> 01:25:54.631]  I've been to a couple of them and
[01:25:56.408 --> 01:25:58.330]  It's so sad for our dear country.
[01:25:59.631 --> 01:26:01.873]  But hey, I wish we could put these guys on the border.
[01:26:02.873 --> 01:26:03.754]  Oh, we can't do that.
[01:26:03.954 --> 01:26:07.117]  I wish we could just get some newspapers to write and comment on it.
[01:26:07.517 --> 01:26:12.702]  I wish we could get the 5,000 Border Patrol they just took off the border to be air marshals.
[01:26:12.722 --> 01:26:16.905]  I wish they could just arm the pilots and stop reducing the size of the Border Patrol.
[01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:21.309]  Yeah, they're reducing the size of the Border Patrol.
[01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:23.711]  But they set up checkpoints with the cops
[01:26:24.787 --> 01:26:27.668]  Pull old ladies out and ransack their vehicles.
[01:26:28.469 --> 01:26:30.390]  Welcome to the Sovietization.
[01:26:33.111 --> 01:26:34.031]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.511 --> 01:26:36.132]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.033 --> 01:26:39.734]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.859 --> 01:26:45.081]  Hey, John Statman here, and I have a question for you.
[01:26:45.281 --> 01:26:46.802]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[01:26:47.162 --> 01:26:49.804]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[01:26:50.024 --> 01:26:51.925]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[01:26:52.266 --> 01:26:53.366]  Do you have the energy you need?
[01:26:53.406 --> 01:26:53.787]  Energy 34438.
[01:26:53.987 --> 01:26:55.048]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:26:55.068 --> 01:26:56.248]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:27:04.745 --> 01:27:07.486]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:27:07.506 --> 01:27:11.427]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:15.968 --> 01:27:20.629]  Alright, John and Spencer and Manuel and others, be patient, we'll get to you here in a few minutes.
[01:27:21.089 --> 01:27:24.609]  And I've got to stop ranting and raving and freaking out over stuff and just get to the news.
[01:27:27.090 --> 01:27:31.191]  I also want to get to 78% of Bush's post-war spending plan is for the military.
[01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:34.311]  And by the way, that's not for defense.
[01:27:34.411 --> 01:27:39.813]  It's for New World Order empire, for the bankers, to make us the scourge of the earth, folks.
[01:27:41.053 --> 01:27:47.075]  Also, the reserves have been told that they may not come back for years.
[01:27:48.505 --> 01:27:55.069]  And people that have gotten out of the military, who've been in for 10 years, are being recalled because they didn't read the fine print.
[01:27:55.249 --> 01:27:56.530]  This is not a volunteer army.
[01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:58.371]  The draft has already begun, folks.
[01:27:58.731 --> 01:28:04.555]  And they've said it's going to be for professionals, engineers, doctors, everybody here domestically.
[01:28:04.595 --> 01:28:05.636]  And they're moving to do it.
[01:28:06.336 --> 01:28:13.681]  So you'll be little technicians during the martial law, during the final destruction of America, if they've got the nerve to go ahead with it.
[01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:14.281]  They may not.
[01:28:14.621 --> 01:28:15.682]  We're trying to fight them right now.
[01:28:17.151 --> 01:28:21.514]  Also, I'm going to read this article just because it illustrates how evil the globalists are.
[01:28:22.194 --> 01:28:24.516]  Arnold Schwarzenegger hangs out with the Rothschilds.
[01:28:25.276 --> 01:28:26.657]  His whole family are Nazis.
[01:28:27.737 --> 01:28:28.798]  His old world family.
[01:28:29.759 --> 01:28:32.841]  He says he admires Hitler on videotape.
[01:28:33.701 --> 01:28:35.262]  He's involved in all this bizarreness.
[01:28:35.302 --> 01:28:38.124]  He's anti-gun, anti-family, for open borders.
[01:28:38.864 --> 01:28:40.185]  And the Republicans are defending him.
[01:28:40.605 --> 01:28:43.207]  Well, we've got his quotes here.
[01:28:44.466 --> 01:28:49.111]  Uh, where now more black people are coming forward that, uh, and I've seen these guys.
[01:28:49.131 --> 01:28:50.713]  They're in, they're in Pumping Iron with Arnold.
[01:28:51.093 --> 01:28:59.802]  This guy in front of hundreds of people ran around saying, I hate all, n-word, n-word, n-word, uh, you're all pathetic trash.
[01:28:59.822 --> 01:29:02.325]  Uh, you know, this is Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:29:02.345 --> 01:29:02.725]  You know what?
[01:29:02.745 --> 01:29:05.008]  It doesn't matter because he's a Rothschild pimp.
[01:29:05.652 --> 01:29:08.253]  This guy could eat black babies on TV.
[01:29:08.594 --> 01:29:12.056]  He'll be praised like, like Kurt Voltheim at the UN.
[01:29:12.256 --> 01:29:12.916]  Top Nazi?
[01:29:12.976 --> 01:29:13.596]  They don't care.
[01:29:13.697 --> 01:29:14.177]  They love him.
[01:29:14.597 --> 01:29:17.559]  The UN admits he's their favorite Secretary General.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.220]  Because he's a scumbag.
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:21.261]  That's what it's all about.
[01:29:21.741 --> 01:29:22.541]  You're a murdering thug?
[01:29:22.561 --> 01:29:23.022]  They love you.
[01:29:23.922 --> 01:29:24.883]  You got Margaret Sanger?
[01:29:24.903 --> 01:29:25.763]  Gave awards to Hitler?
[01:29:25.803 --> 01:29:26.724]  Got awards to Hitler?
[01:29:27.664 --> 01:29:28.945]  The Liberals love her to this day.
[01:29:29.005 --> 01:29:29.805]  Planned Parenthood.
[01:29:30.326 --> 01:29:31.586]  A Nazi organization.
[01:29:32.727 --> 01:29:34.328]  And black leaders will just worship it.
[01:29:35.174 --> 01:29:36.395]  So, Arnold, just fine!
[01:29:36.435 --> 01:29:45.723]  I mean, you can run around in public at galas screaming, I hate black people, and flipping out as part of Roid Rage, and that's okay!
[01:29:47.485 --> 01:29:55.491]  But you love America, you write patriotic music, you talk about controlling our border, defending the Second Amendment, the Simon Wiesenthal Center will list you as a hate group.
[01:29:55.511 --> 01:29:55.952]  They have!
[01:29:57.513 --> 01:30:02.717]  I mean, mainstream gun groups, mainstream music artists, I'm gonna get to that.
[01:30:05.057 --> 01:30:06.458]  Just absolutely incredible.
[01:30:06.518 --> 01:30:07.920]  I got so much other news here.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:19.409]  A huge new section on electronic voting scams run by the government, by the CIA, and it's on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:30:19.429 --> 01:30:21.231]  I hope you tell everybody about it.
[01:30:21.251 --> 01:30:22.212]  We'll get to that too.
[01:30:22.272 --> 01:30:29.818]  With new, new information as a bunch of counties and cities dump the touchscreens when they found out the CIA runs them.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.661]  More on Dr. David Kelly.
[01:30:34.290 --> 01:30:36.592]  More people believe the government carried out September 11th.
[01:30:36.772 --> 01:30:37.732]  Another big poll.
[01:30:40.214 --> 01:30:40.994]  We'll get to that.
[01:30:42.515 --> 01:30:43.176]  It's all coming up.
[01:30:43.276 --> 01:30:47.538]  And for the callers that are sitting there patiently, we're going to get to you here in just a few minutes.
[01:30:47.598 --> 01:30:50.740]  Right now, I want to bring my good buddy, Jim Shepherd, out for five minutes.
[01:30:51.561 --> 01:30:54.763]  Talk about protecting yourselves from all the poison that's in the water, folks.
[01:30:55.123 --> 01:30:56.264]  Jim, thanks for coming on the show.
[01:30:56.404 --> 01:30:57.444]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[01:30:58.025 --> 01:31:03.188]  You know, I was listening to you talking about the Nazis and so forth.
[01:31:04.211 --> 01:31:32.499]  in the liberals and I always get a kick out of it because when I hear the liberals talk about the right wing and that they're extreme and they don't want abortion they don't want homosexuality and that they're a bunch of Nazis and they always accuse the right wing of being Nazis but actually the Nazis were the National Socialist Party that was a liberal organization and so what it means is is that all these labels mean nothing folks better get down to action
[01:31:34.085 --> 01:31:36.565]  I mean, what people are doing, not what they're saying.
[01:31:36.605 --> 01:31:43.907]  I mean, Ron Paul in his speech said the Bush administration is the biggest growth in government, the biggest loss of liberty, the biggest socialism ever seen.
[01:31:44.487 --> 01:31:47.167]  But the neocons can't get that through their heads, Jim.
[01:31:47.827 --> 01:31:53.928]  Well, you know, it seems like there's a big effort to just change the meanings of words.
[01:31:54.989 --> 01:32:03.210]  And, you know, you've got this far-left organization in Germany, this socialist organization,
[01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:09.925]  And then somehow the terminology migrates over time, and now that's a far right-wing organization.
[01:32:10.565 --> 01:32:13.167]  And you know, that's exactly what you get when you go to the far left.
[01:32:13.367 --> 01:32:16.830]  And if the individual gets lost in it, and everything, it's everything for the state.
[01:32:17.010 --> 01:32:20.433]  You know, for the good of the popu... And what is Bush saying?
[01:32:20.453 --> 01:32:21.894]  You're either with us or against us.
[01:32:22.194 --> 01:32:23.215]  Don't ask questions.
[01:32:23.535 --> 01:32:24.015]  Submit.
[01:32:24.095 --> 01:32:24.876]  Give us your rights.
[01:32:26.437 --> 01:32:27.017]  It's incredible.
[01:32:27.098 --> 01:32:28.979]  Jim, you've got two specials today.
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:30.260]  Yes, I do.
[01:32:32.749 --> 01:32:39.594]  Actually, if you give me just a minute here, I'd like to read a letter from one of the people that purchased the Berkey Light.
[01:32:40.415 --> 01:32:42.356]  Thank you for your help in saving my marriage.
[01:32:44.378 --> 01:32:50.282]  Let's see, his wife really likes the LED light enclosed at the other base.
[01:32:50.722 --> 01:32:58.808]  The water tastes great and appears to be as advertised, although I don't know how the filters eventually contaminate the water.
[01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:05.055]  Although I don't know how the filters don't eventually contaminate the water after enough cycles.
[01:33:05.895 --> 01:33:07.837]  And so I thought I would answer that question.
[01:33:07.877 --> 01:33:09.458]  That comes from Ralph.
[01:33:10.199 --> 01:33:12.080]  What does it mean, saving my marriage?
[01:33:13.101 --> 01:33:19.367]  Well, his wife wanted the LED light base, so it was just kind of a quip.
[01:33:19.807 --> 01:33:20.467]  Oh, it's a joke.
[01:33:20.548 --> 01:33:21.268]  Okay, I get it now.
[01:33:21.468 --> 01:33:21.749]  Okay.
[01:33:22.269 --> 01:33:26.953]  Anyway, and he didn't order it, so we sent him off the light base after you ordered the filter.
[01:33:27.586 --> 01:33:34.573]  Anyway, Ralph, the answer to that question is that most filters begin to contaminate the water after four to six months.
[01:33:34.593 --> 01:33:49.707]  That's why you have to replace those, because bacteria actually grows within the filter, and you end up with a situation where after the filter has been colonized, you have more pathogenic bacteria in the post-filtered water than you do in the pre-filtered water.
[01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:53.193]  We've solved that two ways.
[01:33:53.273 --> 01:34:06.041]  First of all, we remove the pathogenic bacteria entirely, and also we have media within the filter that makes the filter self-sterilizing so the bacteria cannot colonize the filter.
[01:34:06.681 --> 01:34:16.367]  Now, the Black-Berkey filter elements will last for about 2,000 gallons, removing entirely pathogenic bacteria, the chemicals that you don't want,
[01:34:17.211 --> 01:34:21.632]  And reducing things like nitrates and heavy metals.
[01:34:22.732 --> 01:34:28.934]  After 2,000 gallons, the filter can continue to be used to remove pathogenic bacteria.
[01:34:28.974 --> 01:34:43.657]  So we recommend to the users that after you've used them for about 2,000 gallons or 4,000 gallons per set, and it's time to replace them, keep those around because there may be an emergency in the future whereby you're going to want to remove the pathogenic bacteria.
[01:34:44.832 --> 01:34:48.795]  Although, it won't remove a lot of the other chemicals that might be in the water.
[01:34:50.136 --> 01:34:59.163]  Now, the specials that we have today, you can find them, if you go up to Infowars.com and click on the Alex Jones specials, that'll bring you to our website.
[01:34:59.963 --> 01:35:01.505]  And you can see these specials.
[01:35:01.545 --> 01:35:07.329]  You can also see the different products, the accessories, pictures of them, descriptions of them.
[01:35:08.289 --> 01:35:11.612]  And the first special is the Berkey Light without lights.
[01:35:12.581 --> 01:35:22.425]  Uh, along with two bottles of potassium iodate or two sport bottles, or mix and match it, and two additional black Berkey filter elements.
[01:35:22.525 --> 01:35:26.647]  This is a $373 value for $298.
[01:35:26.707 --> 01:35:28.047]  It saves you $75.
[01:35:29.168 --> 01:35:33.290]  And then the second special is a Berkey light with either blue or white lights.
[01:35:34.290 --> 01:35:41.573]  Uh, again, two sport bottles or two potassium iodate mix and match, two additional black Berkey replacement elements.
[01:35:42.099 --> 01:35:49.247]  Plus, we'll also include the battery adapter, which allows you to use regular alkaline batteries during emergencies.
[01:35:49.527 --> 01:35:56.015]  And a set of four will light the emergency light on this Berkey light for over two weeks at night.
[01:35:57.076 --> 01:35:58.097]  And that's a $445 value.
[01:35:58.117 --> 01:35:58.677]  You get it for $345.
[01:35:58.738 --> 01:35:59.258]  That's $100 savings.
[01:36:04.025 --> 01:36:08.467]  Alright, and if folks want the little Stuller charger, you have that as well.
[01:36:08.987 --> 01:36:10.668]  And they can also call toll-free 1-888-803-4438.
[01:36:10.688 --> 01:36:11.368]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:36:11.388 --> 01:36:12.748]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:36:12.768 --> 01:36:14.309]  And you have checked in for wars.com.
[01:36:14.369 --> 01:36:15.489]  We did get that up, Jim.
[01:36:23.212 --> 01:36:24.133]  I haven't checked yet.
[01:36:24.173 --> 01:36:24.973]  I talked with Violet.
[01:36:24.993 --> 01:36:26.334]  She said she was going to post it.
[01:36:26.434 --> 01:36:27.294]  I presume it's up.
[01:36:27.594 --> 01:36:27.814]  Good.
[01:36:27.834 --> 01:36:28.755]  Well, I'm sure it is, then.
[01:36:29.255 --> 01:36:35.298]  And if not, they can link through to your website directly, and that is... BerkeyLite.com.
[01:36:35.438 --> 01:36:35.758]  All right.
[01:36:35.818 --> 01:36:36.678]  And then just surf around.
[01:36:36.698 --> 01:36:45.162]  You'll find the Alex Jones special there on the site, and it will be up on, if it's not already there, Infowars.com.
[01:36:45.723 --> 01:36:46.503]  Or again, folks, 888-803-8000.
[01:36:49.369 --> 01:36:54.833]  4-4-3-8, and if you call and the operators are busy, leave your name and number, they'll call you right back, folks.
[01:36:55.414 --> 01:36:58.016]  Top of the line stuff, great prices, and it supports the show.
[01:36:58.036 --> 01:36:59.717]  888-803-4438.
[01:36:59.877 --> 01:37:02.620]  Uh, Jim, thanks for coming on the show, my friend.
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:03.400]  Keep up the good work.
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:04.241]  You bet, we'll see you.
[01:37:04.341 --> 01:37:04.841]  Uh-huh, bye-bye.
[01:37:05.202 --> 01:37:12.547]  Alright, now I am about to go to your calls, those that have been holding, but I said I've got to get to this, and I'm going to cover it right now, because this is just so despicable.
[01:37:12.868 --> 01:37:16.851]  A bunch of different bodybuilders have gone public about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:37:17.632 --> 01:37:24.778]  And, you know, it was just a couple bodybuilders saying he didn't like black people and called him the N-word over and over again.
[01:37:24.798 --> 01:37:37.368]  And I'm going to read the former Mr. Universe's quotes here, he is a black man, about what Arnold would say to him.
[01:37:37.488 --> 01:37:40.891]  I wouldn't believe this if I hadn't watched Pumping Iron 15 years ago.
[01:37:41.452 --> 01:37:44.314]  And Arnold bumps into people and bosses them around and
[01:37:45.569 --> 01:37:49.812]  In one of the earlier versions says that he admires Adolf Hitler, and that's been reported by MSNBC.
[01:37:50.172 --> 01:37:52.234]  Interestingly enough, the newer versions have that cut out.
[01:37:53.034 --> 01:37:53.915]  So he admires Hitler.
[01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:55.696]  Admires Hitler, folks.
[01:37:56.556 --> 01:37:58.137]  And then you add all the other stuff together.
[01:37:58.357 --> 01:38:11.205]  And after I read this, this is why you need to go to Infowars.com, and this is why you need to get the article I've written, that has all this together in one place, and email it out to everybody, so they can see the hypocrisy of the New World Order.
[01:38:11.706 --> 01:38:13.867]  Because I'm sick of them calling good people racist.
[01:38:15.071 --> 01:38:16.072]  I mean, that's their tactics.
[01:38:16.152 --> 01:38:17.293]  They're the racist folks.
[01:38:17.313 --> 01:38:20.756]  The Democrats, the Republicans, they hate everybody but the elite.
[01:38:22.378 --> 01:38:23.519]  I want you to understand that.
[01:38:23.559 --> 01:38:24.500]  And I'm sick of them.
[01:38:25.841 --> 01:38:28.163]  This is who the Simon Wiesenthal Center is defending, folks.
[01:38:28.644 --> 01:38:33.348]  Second black bodybuilder claims Schwarzenegger racist comments from Drudge Report.
[01:38:34.049 --> 01:38:35.530]  And they were interviewed by ABC News.
[01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:36.291]  They won't play it.
[01:38:37.512 --> 01:38:39.854]  Because, again, the head of ABC is a Grove member.
[01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:50.297]  Another black bodybuilder has come forward claiming the California gubernatorial candidate, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has a history of making racist comments.
[01:38:51.998 --> 01:39:03.204]  Robbie Robinson, one of the most respected and well-known of all bodybuilders, a former Mr. America, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, title holder, backs up claims made by fellow black bodybuilder Rick Wayne.
[01:39:03.985 --> 01:39:05.626]  And I've read the different news reports years ago.
[01:39:05.726 --> 01:39:09.408]  Arnold dropped out in the late 70s because he couldn't beat this guy and came back later.
[01:39:11.158 --> 01:39:12.579]  That's why he hated him so much.
[01:39:12.619 --> 01:39:15.039]  That's why he'd run around calling him nigger over and over again.
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:18.661]  No disrespect to fans of Arnold.
[01:39:18.681 --> 01:39:20.742]  This is what Robbie Robinson is saying.
[01:39:21.142 --> 01:39:26.203]  No disrespect to fans of Arnold, but Rick's claim is in keeping with my experience.
[01:39:26.223 --> 01:39:28.624]  He's talking about another bodybuilder who said that Arnold did this.
[01:39:29.185 --> 01:39:32.906]  Which the man says, Robinson explains in a message.
[01:39:33.544 --> 01:39:37.205]  Robinson says that Schwarzenegger repeatedly directed the term nigger at him.
[01:39:37.686 --> 01:39:55.292]  More, known throughout his career as the Black Prince, Robinson continues, in San Jose at the Russ Weiner Classic, as it was called in the days, there was a scene, seven or eight of us bodybuilders who were invited to guest pose at the show.
[01:39:55.632 --> 01:39:56.932]  We were all paid $650 to do our thing.
[01:39:58.974 --> 01:40:00.836]  After the show, there was a big banquet.
[01:40:00.856 --> 01:40:02.857]  We were all dancing, having a nice time.
[01:40:03.238 --> 01:40:09.222]  And in walks Arnold, who started shouting out, down with the blacks, inners... I'm not going to keep saying it.
[01:40:09.242 --> 01:40:10.163]  I just wanted you to know what he was saying.
[01:40:10.664 --> 01:40:16.308]  Down with the blacks, down with the n-word, this and that, black that, for about ten minutes.
[01:40:17.169 --> 01:40:19.791]  During all this time, nobody said a word.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:23.020]  Because Arnold was known for his vicious rages.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:28.881]  The banquet hall was full of IFFB, International Federation of Bodybuilders, officials.
[01:40:29.622 --> 01:40:30.882]  There was a dead silence.
[01:40:30.902 --> 01:40:32.622]  You couldn't hear a pin fall.
[01:40:32.662 --> 01:40:35.643]  Everybody in the room was shocked except for me.
[01:40:36.463 --> 01:40:37.603]  And then he continues to quote.
[01:40:37.863 --> 01:40:40.083]  All of this hostility and rage was directed at me.
[01:40:40.383 --> 01:40:44.544]  For once he got caught out of shape and I was in contest condition.
[01:40:45.004 --> 01:40:48.645]  Me being in great shape put him in a bad light and a bad attitude.
[01:40:49.329 --> 01:40:51.650]  In my mind, I wanted to bust him up.
[01:40:52.311 --> 01:40:54.012]  I'd love to have seen that.
[01:40:54.532 --> 01:40:56.273]  In my mind, I wanted to bust him up.
[01:40:56.773 --> 01:40:58.834]  But that would not have done any good.
[01:40:59.234 --> 01:41:03.256]  So with all my intensity bottled up inside me, I walked out of the room.
[01:41:03.677 --> 01:41:09.840]  I'm walking out as he was still in a mode of Down with the Blacks when the silence was broken by Joe
[01:41:10.868 --> 01:41:11.729]  We're good to go.
[01:41:29.469 --> 01:41:37.856]  More racial slurs were directed at me because I walked out of his house refusing to be involved in the movie if we were not getting paid something.
[01:41:38.217 --> 01:41:48.746]  We ended up getting $100 a day, but not before more racial slurs of NN were leveled at me for speaking up for myself and the rest of the guys.
[01:41:50.808 --> 01:41:51.909]  And so it goes on.
[01:41:52.509 --> 01:41:53.650]  And he says that
[01:41:55.226 --> 01:41:59.008]  There's a lot of ghost in bodybuilding has a lot as a dark past.
[01:41:59.509 --> 01:42:17.139]  It's a tragedy and it says the Wieners and Arnold have to deal with their ghost being uncovered Now see real people that really do hate Mexicans and blacks and Asians
[01:42:17.896 --> 01:42:21.257]  Are the ones dancing around saying if you're pro-gun you're a Nazi.
[01:42:21.357 --> 01:42:22.357]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:42:22.797 --> 01:42:25.178]  I'm sick and tired of the real racists out there!
[01:42:25.958 --> 01:42:37.282]  And I'm talking about the Nazis, I'm talking about the Zionists, I'm talking about the black people like Khalid Mohammed who says kill all white people and gets funded by the Ford Foundation.
[01:42:37.502 --> 01:42:40.103]  I'm talking about the Mexican racists like Nacho Larraza.
[01:42:40.583 --> 01:42:42.163]  I'm sick of all of you!
[01:42:42.603 --> 01:42:44.504]  And we're going to expose all of you!
[01:42:46.875 --> 01:42:50.816]  And all your different racist statements and all the stuff you're involved in.
[01:42:51.816 --> 01:42:54.397]  You just better be put on notice for that.
[01:42:56.537 --> 01:42:57.337]  Makes me sick.
[01:42:57.397 --> 01:42:59.078]  And you've got the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[01:42:59.118 --> 01:42:59.918]  Folks, they had a list.
[01:42:59.938 --> 01:43:00.538]  Digital Hate 2000.
[01:43:00.578 --> 01:43:02.158]  It was hundreds of groups.
[01:43:02.479 --> 01:43:04.979]  And they had mainstream Second Amendment groups on there.
[01:43:05.619 --> 01:43:09.520]  People I know, groups run by black people that aren't about race.
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.100]  They'd list them as hate groups.
[01:43:11.921 --> 01:43:13.341]  I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[01:43:14.398 --> 01:43:26.349]  And how the media can cover this up for Arnold Schwarzenegger, when he says he loves Hitler, and he runs into a banquet hall full of hundreds of people, saying, down with the blacks and a bunch of stuff I can't even say here on the air.
[01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.351]  Okay?
[01:43:29.011 --> 01:43:30.192]  And that's how he behaves.
[01:43:30.232 --> 01:43:31.273]  That's what he does.
[01:43:31.513 --> 01:43:36.538]  And that's okay, because he's anti-gun, he's anti-family, he's pro-open border.
[01:43:37.412 --> 01:43:38.573]  He's a neocon!
[01:43:38.834 --> 01:43:39.735]  He's a Trojan horse!
[01:43:39.915 --> 01:43:51.629]  So next time you hear Limbaugh and Hannity and the rest of those people on the air defending him, going, the liberals, the liberals are trying to get him, the liberals, the liberals are not trying to get him!
[01:43:52.873 --> 01:43:58.274]  Man, the dirt Arnold's got if the so-called liberal media wanted to end his political career now, it would have happened.
[01:43:58.474 --> 01:44:04.136]  Instead, they're moving to get rid of the second article of the Constitution to make this piece of trash president.
[01:44:04.496 --> 01:44:07.157]  This, this, this Bohemian Grove member.
[01:44:07.377 --> 01:44:10.778]  A guy who hangs out with the former Secretary General of the UN.
[01:44:10.998 --> 01:44:12.678]  The guy who's married to the Kennedys!
[01:44:13.678 --> 01:44:15.719]  That shows you how fake the neocons are.
[01:44:15.939 --> 01:44:17.559]  Look at who their champion is.
[01:44:18.439 --> 01:44:20.220]  And no, I'm not for Governor Davis.
[01:44:21.212 --> 01:44:25.473]  But Governor Davis is a 45 to the head of California, and so is Arnold.
[01:44:26.334 --> 01:44:34.836]  It's like having a bucket of poison, of cyanide, and saying, well, you're a liberal because you don't want to drink the bucket marked Schwarzenegger.
[01:44:36.997 --> 01:44:39.938]  And I'm like, it doesn't matter which bucket of poison I drink.
[01:44:40.178 --> 01:44:41.378]  America's dying!
[01:44:42.318 --> 01:44:43.879]  This is such a great example.
[01:44:45.936 --> 01:44:47.397]  Of how incredible they are.
[01:44:47.937 --> 01:44:55.302]  I caught two black guys getting paid off for testifying falsely in the state legislature, and I got called a racist in the newspaper, folks.
[01:44:57.123 --> 01:44:57.963]  These are black men.
[01:44:58.083 --> 01:45:01.125]  Yes, they were caught being paid off, but are you a racist, Mr. Jones?
[01:45:01.385 --> 01:45:02.086]  I'm sick of it!
[01:45:03.661 --> 01:45:10.066]  The illuminated berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:45:10.226 --> 01:45:16.571]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:45:16.871 --> 01:45:25.617]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:45:25.858 --> 01:45:33.063]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:45:33.363 --> 01:45:38.286]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:45:38.507 --> 01:45:44.030]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:45:44.370 --> 01:45:47.533]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[01:47:03.442 --> 01:47:10.267]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:47:10.607 --> 01:47:11.968]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:47:12.168 --> 01:47:14.369]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:47:14.509 --> 01:47:16.611]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:47:16.891 --> 01:47:21.814]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:47:22.154 --> 01:47:26.197]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:47:26.437 --> 01:47:28.218]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:47:28.298 --> 01:47:38.947]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:47:39.087 --> 01:47:41.008]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:48:11.183 --> 01:48:13.964]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:15.564 --> 01:48:16.785]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:48:17.965 --> 01:48:20.886]  Go back to the calls, and then I'm going to get into a bunch of other news.
[01:48:20.926 --> 01:48:23.907]  Again, I haven't even scratched the surface, but I'm doing a good job of covering most of it today.
[01:48:25.006 --> 01:48:26.448]  Frankly, it gets even more insane.
[01:48:26.488 --> 01:48:27.510]  I was into the stack here.
[01:48:27.530 --> 01:48:31.315]  Uh, let's, uh... No, I don't even know who's up next.
[01:48:31.395 --> 01:48:32.697]  John in Tennessee, go ahead.
[01:48:33.558 --> 01:48:37.824]  Yeah, Arnold, uh, loves to stalk people out, but that sounds like roid rage addiction to me.
[01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:41.629]  He used to also parade around in a Nazi uniform at home.
[01:48:43.007 --> 01:48:50.793]  Well, that's true, and he, uh, liked posing for the homosexual magazines, and hangs out with top Nazis, and calls them uncle.
[01:48:51.174 --> 01:48:52.074]  But that's okay!
[01:48:52.114 --> 01:48:52.715]  The media!
[01:48:53.055 --> 01:48:54.576]  ABC has all these witnesses!
[01:48:54.897 --> 01:48:56.618]  Banquet rooms of people!
[01:48:57.238 --> 01:48:58.600]  Okay, but that's okay!
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:48:59.800]  We're not gonna talk about it!
[01:48:59.961 --> 01:49:02.683]  But some real patriot comes out who loves America!
[01:49:03.684 --> 01:49:05.745]  Some say he might be like Pat Buchanan!
[01:49:05.825 --> 01:49:07.707]  Some say he might be racist!
[01:49:09.108 --> 01:49:10.610]  Uh, I want to change the subject.
[01:49:10.630 --> 01:49:16.715]  The 9-1-1 specials this week on PBS and History Channel, uh, let some interesting facts slip out.
[01:49:17.555 --> 01:49:22.940]  Uh, they said the jet fuel in the World Trade Center only burned for three to five minutes maximum.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:26.343]  The rest of the fire was paper, and that's why the steel melted.
[01:49:27.324 --> 01:49:33.009]  They also said the, uh... Oh yeah, the official government report, I don't know why they released it, admits that that's not the fact.
[01:49:33.029 --> 01:49:34.470]  That thing came out two weeks ago.
[01:49:35.376 --> 01:49:35.636]  Yeah.
[01:49:35.816 --> 01:49:38.157]  Well, the World Trade Center... And I spent about two minutes on it.
[01:49:38.217 --> 01:49:40.338]  I should spend more time on that, shouldn't I?
[01:49:40.978 --> 01:49:41.279]  Yeah.
[01:49:41.359 --> 01:49:47.721]  The WTC did cost $300 million to build, but cost 30 times more to destroy.
[01:49:47.761 --> 01:49:51.723]  A $9 billion contract paid to control demolitions and BFI.
[01:49:52.443 --> 01:50:00.947]  They quoted eyewitnesses saying a cruise missile with wings hit the Pentagon and said the global New World Order was too powerful for America and the World Trade Center.
[01:50:01.451 --> 01:50:05.035]  Wait a minute, you're telling me, who said that?
[01:50:05.315 --> 01:50:09.859]  I can't remember if it was PBS or the History Channel, but one of the two said that.
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:24.274]  They said the globalism was represented by the World Trade Center, and that it was mainly foreigners that worked there, and that the New World Order was just too powerful for the image of America's ownership of the World Trade Center.
[01:50:25.528 --> 01:50:31.991]  I'll tell you, these people love throwing it in our face.
[01:50:32.051 --> 01:50:33.252]  I'm getting so sick of them.
[01:50:33.272 --> 01:50:34.453]  And what did they say to that?
[01:50:34.473 --> 01:50:35.113]  The Easter Bunny?
[01:50:47.529 --> 01:50:52.211]  I don't know if they had whistleblowers trying to leak the facts out, or if they're just so stupid.
[01:50:52.311 --> 01:50:55.312]  Hey, I saw a little blurb in Reuters about the Nazi uniform.
[01:50:55.572 --> 01:50:57.072]  Where did you hear about the Nazi uniform?
[01:50:57.153 --> 01:51:07.856]  I read that in an autobiography, or a biography, an unauthorized biography about, in the 1980s, about it, because I used to do bodybuilding, and, like, you know, try to read up.
[01:51:07.916 --> 01:51:11.178]  He would parade around, I saw that, in a Nazi uniform.
[01:51:11.278 --> 01:51:12.258]  At home, in private.
[01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:17.811]  You know, I guess only his friends saw that, but of course they would talk about it, because that's pretty bizarre.
[01:51:18.512 --> 01:51:24.234]  Even if his father was a Nazi, my dad was in the military, but I don't parade around in his uniform.
[01:51:24.274 --> 01:51:25.814]  He's a psychopath, thanks for the call.
[01:51:27.175 --> 01:51:27.515]  Yeah.
[01:51:27.655 --> 01:51:33.977]  They all do that kind of stuff, and we've had major... I have the media critic on from CBC.
[01:51:35.291 --> 01:51:43.018]  He said he was talking about these top globalists, how they wear king outfits and have meetings in king outfits.
[01:51:43.098 --> 01:51:46.081]  You know, they're all dressed up with a purple robe and a crown.
[01:51:46.101 --> 01:51:48.683]  I mean, there's total lunatics, folks.
[01:51:48.743 --> 01:51:51.326]  We're dealing with total power-mad psychopaths.
[01:51:52.987 --> 01:51:54.309]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[01:51:54.509 --> 01:51:55.810]  A lot of trouble right now.
[01:51:56.630 --> 01:51:57.631]  You better get involved.
[01:51:57.651 --> 01:51:58.632]  You better speak out.

[01:52:54.131 --> 01:52:56.113]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:52:56.193 --> 01:53:12.146]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Blacky Light... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.691 --> 01:53:20.332]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.992 --> 01:53:22.053]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.773 --> 01:53:23.874]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.535 --> 01:53:25.335]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.096 --> 01:53:27.016]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.036 --> 01:53:31.580]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:35.963]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.424 --> 01:53:42.948]  Cutting through the propaganda, the lies, the disinformation.
[01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:45.470]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:53:47.409 --> 01:53:51.631]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 and back from 9 to midnight, old time central.
[01:53:52.551 --> 01:53:55.733]  I've been pretty fired up the last few days because stuff's just out of control.
[01:53:55.773 --> 01:54:00.415]  I want to recap some of the top stories later in this hour that a lot of you may have not heard in the first hour.
[01:54:00.875 --> 01:54:02.716]  I want to get into some other news I haven't covered.
[01:54:02.736 --> 01:54:08.479]  And I want to get back into some news that I should have spent more time on, like Asian debt withdrawal, threat to U.S.
[01:54:08.559 --> 01:54:12.661]  deficit, how that ties into Ron Paul saying we're going to go into a depression.
[01:54:14.089 --> 01:54:29.857]  Also, I want to get into the so-called War on Terror needs 78 more, 78, 68 more billion dollars, but now they're saying 78% of that will be spent on military adventurism overseas.
[01:54:31.378 --> 01:54:36.301]  Also, to move about, you'll have different color codes, like I guess, like people with the yellow stars on them.
[01:54:36.917 --> 01:54:39.938]  We'll all have a different color code for what we're allowed to do, where we're allowed to go.
[01:54:39.998 --> 01:54:43.438]  Even if we've never been convicted of anything, even having bad credit, you're going to be a slave.
[01:54:43.478 --> 01:54:45.639]  More on the Caps 2 system.
[01:54:45.659 --> 01:54:46.979]  That's from the Washington Post.
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:54.881]  Oh, the new peach-colored 20s to make their debut in 30 days!
[01:54:56.261 --> 01:54:57.481]  Colored money is coming out.
[01:54:57.521 --> 01:54:58.262]  I call them pink.
[01:54:58.622 --> 01:54:59.882]  They call them peach, folks.
[01:55:01.087 --> 01:55:02.727]  Our PICO money's coming out.
[01:55:02.767 --> 01:55:05.148]  I'll tell you all about that, what that means, how that goes together.
[01:55:05.448 --> 01:55:08.788]  And an incredible development with the voting machines being run by the government.
[01:55:09.188 --> 01:55:10.049]  That's admitted, folks.
[01:55:10.089 --> 01:55:11.269]  Run by the CIA!
[01:55:11.489 --> 01:55:12.829]  No more voting in America!
[01:55:13.349 --> 01:55:19.290]  That's why they're on the news saying, you'll all be getting your microchips and saves after the next terror attack!
[01:55:20.250 --> 01:55:22.291]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:55:22.331 --> 01:55:23.951]  I appreciate folks holding so long.
[01:55:25.711 --> 01:55:28.152]  I guess Manuel in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:55:28.192 --> 01:55:28.572]  Go ahead.
[01:55:28.992 --> 01:55:29.672]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:55:29.892 --> 01:55:30.272]  Pretty good.
[01:55:31.161 --> 01:55:37.003]  So now we know the precious batch of Luciferian honey-glazed rat poison is a racist.
[01:55:37.443 --> 01:55:38.223]  Surprise, surprise.
[01:55:38.683 --> 01:55:39.503]  Oh yeah, Arnold.
[01:55:40.283 --> 01:55:40.704]  I love that.
[01:55:40.724 --> 01:55:42.304]  Our honey-glazed rat poison.
[01:55:42.384 --> 01:55:43.844]  Straight out the Luciferian beehive.
[01:55:44.685 --> 01:55:46.505]  Well, check this out.
[01:55:46.865 --> 01:55:48.606]  I saw the 9-11 movie.
[01:55:49.146 --> 01:55:49.786]  I know Chet Wynn.
[01:55:50.926 --> 01:55:52.126]  You brought in the expression.
[01:55:52.286 --> 01:55:56.588]  It's a mass defecation upon the heads of the victims' families and everybody in this country.
[01:55:57.588 --> 01:55:58.088]  It's horrible.
[01:55:59.235 --> 01:56:04.857]  You know, I hope somebody tapes that because I can't make myself watch it other than in a review mode.
[01:56:04.877 --> 01:56:05.757]  It was hard.
[01:56:06.157 --> 01:56:07.637]  It was hard because I was sitting there.
[01:56:07.657 --> 01:56:08.938]  I'm going to tell you the truth.
[01:56:08.998 --> 01:56:10.338]  I really don't ever feel like that.
[01:56:10.358 --> 01:56:13.399]  You know, you see a lot of stuff, but that's horrible.
[01:56:17.091 --> 01:56:25.358]  The figurehead of those that attacked us, to see the serial killers posing as our saviors in a made-for-TV movie, that's pretty painful.
[01:56:25.718 --> 01:56:28.020]  It's hard to... I don't even know, how could they even do that?
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:30.081]  How could they perpetrate this type of thing?
[01:56:30.122 --> 01:56:31.543]  It's not wired into my brain.
[01:56:32.423 --> 01:56:37.948]  That's why they're in total power, because they're totally ruthless and have gone against their own human programming that God gave us.
[01:56:38.408 --> 01:56:38.849]  That's true.
[01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:40.170]  They are really sick.
[01:56:42.461 --> 01:56:43.862]  He reads a Bible.
[01:56:43.962 --> 01:56:47.725]  It must be the Luciferian, uh, Skull and Bones, second revised edition Bible.
[01:56:47.765 --> 01:56:49.866]  Oh, that's to manipulate the mindless fake Christians.
[01:56:50.206 --> 01:56:52.268]  He reads every night before he goes to sleep.
[01:56:52.688 --> 01:56:53.608]  I mean, this is horrible.
[01:56:54.009 --> 01:56:56.550]  Oh, so in the movie he reads the Bible and loves the children.
[01:56:56.610 --> 01:56:58.172]  Oh, and you're going to bug out when you see this.
[01:56:58.592 --> 01:57:05.957]  His wife tells him, no Bush, you shouldn't have said in your speech, we want him dead or alive because the world is not full of Texans.
[01:57:06.457 --> 01:57:07.718]  You know, because now he's from Texas.
[01:57:08.854 --> 01:57:09.274]  It's a joke.
[01:57:09.494 --> 01:57:12.256]  Oh yeah, now it's, you're too tough, you're too radical.
[01:57:13.036 --> 01:57:19.900]  He said, he loves, this is his quote in the movie, I forgot who it was, but globalists pulled out a constitution.
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:22.261]  Check this out, like they walk around with pocket constitutions.
[01:57:22.881 --> 01:57:23.382]  Come on now.
[01:57:23.762 --> 01:57:25.363]  They're sitting at the little policy table.
[01:57:26.463 --> 01:57:27.764]  And who's going to believe this?
[01:57:27.824 --> 01:57:29.305]  I think this is going to wake some people up.
[01:57:29.585 --> 01:57:30.285]  It's so stupid.
[01:57:30.806 --> 01:57:32.026]  Psyops did not approve this.
[01:57:32.266 --> 01:57:32.807]  There's no way.
[01:57:33.527 --> 01:57:37.269]  He pulls out a pocket constitution and he tells Bush, we do have this, you know.
[01:57:37.839 --> 01:57:38.860]  Hey, when's it going to re-air?
[01:57:54.258 --> 01:57:55.758]  You're going to walk through a wall if you don't laugh.
[01:57:55.979 --> 01:57:56.919]  When's it going to re-air?
[01:57:57.359 --> 01:57:58.299]  I don't even know, man.
[01:57:58.779 --> 01:57:59.059]  Crazy.
[01:57:59.420 --> 01:58:00.780]  Well, I hope somebody tapes it out.
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:06.982]  Lionel Chatwin threatened me in a bathroom on a stage when I was on national TV debating him.
[01:58:07.362 --> 01:58:09.843]  He said, Alex Jones, we're going to get you.
[01:58:10.903 --> 01:58:12.984]  I think he's getting everybody with his propaganda.
[01:58:13.004 --> 01:58:13.584]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:15.177 --> 01:58:19.540]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:24.143]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:58:24.283 --> 01:58:28.686]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:58:28.706 --> 01:58:30.027]  The New World Order.
[01:58:31.825 --> 01:58:36.047]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:58:36.127 --> 01:58:43.049]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:58:43.169 --> 01:58:45.269]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:58:45.529 --> 01:58:55.993]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:58:56.193 --> 01:58:57.073]  If you want to understand

[02:00:44.172 --> 02:00:46.035]  That's because it has an elevated base.

[02:01:03.192 --> 02:01:03.872]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:01:03.892 --> 02:01:04.893]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:01:05.253 --> 02:01:06.973]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:27.526 --> 02:01:29.447]  We're talking to Manuel in Pennsylvania.
[02:01:30.887 --> 02:01:32.527]  I couldn't bear to watch it last night.
[02:01:33.108 --> 02:01:43.611]  I read some of the CNN story about how wonderful the movie was, and how wonderful Lionel Chaplin is, and how he is a conservative, and his last film was about a wonderful homosexual.
[02:01:44.011 --> 02:01:45.891]  That actually said that, because he's conservative.
[02:01:46.771 --> 02:01:55.634]  And the homosexual, of course, is a big hero and all, but his newest film, uh, is, uh, aired last night, and I'm digging, trying to dig around the article, I forget which network,
[02:01:56.613 --> 02:02:09.357]  About how, because I just read the text of what was in the film, Bush gets real mad, wants to have a fist fight with Bin Laden, and reads the Bible every night, and I saw that part, you know, but Manuel was telling me about some other developments.
[02:02:09.437 --> 02:02:11.318]  First off, what network did this air on?
[02:02:11.338 --> 02:02:12.578]  Showtime.
[02:02:14.019 --> 02:02:22.921]  Okay, Showtime, because for those that don't know, Lionel Chetwin, again, threatened me on the set of The Conspiracy Zone.
[02:02:22.941 --> 02:02:24.322]  I didn't even know who he was.
[02:02:25.330 --> 02:02:27.732]  I knew I was going to be debating him and, you know, read something about him.
[02:02:27.772 --> 02:02:29.133]  I didn't know what he looked like particularly.
[02:02:29.413 --> 02:02:33.816]  He walks into the bathroom and says, you're Alex Jones, we're going to get you.
[02:02:34.277 --> 02:02:37.359]  Then I walk out in front of witnesses and I say, Ronald Chapman just threatened me.
[02:02:37.379 --> 02:02:39.280]  And he goes, oh, I was just joking.
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:40.861]  So that's why it's on the record.
[02:02:41.902 --> 02:02:45.104]  And now there's this made-for-TV movie.
[02:02:45.144 --> 02:02:46.886]  Manuel, you say you've seen it.
[02:02:48.387 --> 02:02:50.888]  Give me some of the other gems of it.
[02:02:51.489 --> 02:02:52.430]  I saw this Sunday night.
[02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:54.251]  I'm still recovering, so bear with me.
[02:02:54.966 --> 02:02:57.307]  But, I'm serious, Bush, he was crying.
[02:02:57.527 --> 02:02:59.447]  In the movie, he cried at least three or four times.
[02:03:00.228 --> 02:03:01.968]  You know, he'll shed a tear or two, very manly.
[02:03:02.488 --> 02:03:04.289]  You know, just his deep passion for the country.
[02:03:04.769 --> 02:03:17.333]  He'd call on his wife and Dick Cheney, he'd argue with them, saying, he's staying in the White House, no matter what the Secret Service tells him, because if the terrorists are gonna get him, and this is his quote in the movie, they're gonna get him in his bed, he said.
[02:03:17.913 --> 02:03:19.573]  He said, tell them to come over here and get me.
[02:03:20.414 --> 02:03:20.654]  What?
[02:03:20.914 --> 02:03:21.634]  Come on, man.
[02:03:22.597 --> 02:03:29.560]  Yeah, that was the thing I saw on the Canadian news was is that they show Bush not running away and they have to like physically restrain him.
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:30.761]  He goes, I want to fight him!
[02:03:30.821 --> 02:03:31.961]  I want to fist fight him!
[02:03:32.022 --> 02:03:33.442]  I mean, folks, come on!
[02:03:33.462 --> 02:03:34.143]  Can I read a quote?
[02:03:34.603 --> 02:03:34.843]  Sure.
[02:03:35.103 --> 02:03:35.783]  I'll leave you with a quote.
[02:03:35.803 --> 02:03:37.304]  You might have read it on your broadcast before.
[02:03:37.324 --> 02:03:38.064]  This fits the time.
[02:03:38.745 --> 02:03:39.345]  Old quote, but.
[02:03:40.105 --> 02:03:44.047]  A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious, but it can't survive freedom from within.
[02:03:44.067 --> 02:03:48.389]  The enemy at the gates is less formidable, but he's known and carries his banners openly.
[02:03:48.789 --> 02:03:51.871]  Traitor moves among those within the gates freely, his fly whispers,
[02:03:52.321 --> 02:03:53.102]  That was Cicero, wasn't it?
[02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:18.710]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:04:18.770 --> 02:04:19.610]  Really appreciate it.
[02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:23.152]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared.
[02:04:23.452 --> 02:04:29.836]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[02:04:31.717 --> 02:04:40.923]  And you know, I knew instantly as Chetwyn held up his fist and then pointed his finger at me, with all the hatred he could muster, and said, you're Alex Jones.
[02:04:41.143 --> 02:04:41.843]  Oh, yes I am.
[02:04:42.383 --> 02:04:44.985]  We're gonna get you, showed me his teeth.
[02:04:47.276 --> 02:04:50.177]  Big fat pig showing me his teeth.
[02:04:51.518 --> 02:04:54.719]  And I knew right then as I followed him out of the bathroom because he scurried past me.
[02:04:54.759 --> 02:04:56.100]  He said it and like got afraid of me.
[02:04:56.140 --> 02:04:58.641]  And I was just laughing at him and walked around the corner.
[02:04:59.742 --> 02:05:01.342]  And he walked out in front of the producers.
[02:05:01.402 --> 02:05:02.763]  I said, hey, Chetwyn just threatened me.
[02:05:03.443 --> 02:05:04.404]  He said, I was just joking.
[02:05:04.444 --> 02:05:06.665]  I said, you're mad about the Bohemian Grove, aren't you?
[02:05:08.145 --> 02:05:08.946]  Aren't you, Chetwyn?
[02:05:09.266 --> 02:05:11.407]  He turned back and turned white, folks.
[02:05:12.822 --> 02:05:24.629]  Because, you know, he's the big screenwriter, the big Hollywood Republican, and he hangs out with Karl Rove and admits they all go to the Grove, so... See, Chetwyn doesn't... Chetwyn's been having discussions about me, hmm?
[02:05:24.649 --> 02:05:27.891]  Because that was just like a year and a half after I snuck in the Grove.
[02:05:27.911 --> 02:05:30.472]  That was a... I snuck in the Grove three years ago.
[02:05:31.513 --> 02:05:32.734]  July 3rd, it was three years.
[02:05:33.994 --> 02:05:34.995]  Boy, how time flies.
[02:05:36.636 --> 02:05:38.957]  And... There he was.
[02:05:39.858 --> 02:05:40.178]  And now...
[02:05:40.825 --> 02:05:41.285]  Let me tell you.
[02:05:41.726 --> 02:05:43.486]  I was at Waco about five, six years ago.
[02:05:43.506 --> 02:05:44.467]  I guess it was six years ago.
[02:05:44.487 --> 02:05:45.828]  No, it was seven.
[02:05:47.028 --> 02:05:47.929]  First time I went.
[02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:50.970]  It's now like the tenth anniversary just passed and I didn't go.
[02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.671]  I've been too busy.
[02:05:51.711 --> 02:05:55.973]  But up the street where they murdered those people and then did it in front of everybody.
[02:05:57.934 --> 02:05:59.935]  But the first time I was there I wasn't even a speaker.
[02:05:59.995 --> 02:06:00.595]  I was just there.
[02:06:00.615 --> 02:06:04.077]  It was before we built the Memorial Church for those that died.
[02:06:05.218 --> 02:06:09.600]  And there was the producer of the made-for-TV
[02:06:11.281 --> 02:06:20.508]  movie about Waco that started production like three days after the siege began and was on TV before the siege ended.
[02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:25.231]  Before 51 days, folks, this thing was produced on TV.
[02:06:25.732 --> 02:06:30.375]  The guy, and I've read news articles about him before and about his apologies, now he's spoken out against the film he made.
[02:06:32.216 --> 02:06:37.340]  I need to dig his name out because I shouldn't even talk about it if I don't have it in front of me, but the point is he started crying
[02:06:39.105 --> 02:06:47.729]  And he said, you know, the government came to me, the network came to me, and this aired, I think, was on NBC, and he said, they came to me, they wanted me to produce this quickly, and it was a lie, and it was wrong.
[02:06:48.730 --> 02:06:50.431]  And I'm sorry, and began to cry.
[02:06:50.991 --> 02:06:54.092]  I was there, folks, watching a big producer say all this.
[02:06:56.574 --> 02:06:57.954]  And what happens in the movie?
[02:06:58.174 --> 02:07:07.399]  They pull up, and Katherine Madison, who's like 89 years old now, but at times she's like 70-something, he has a heavy machine gun, an M60, like Rambo.
[02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:13.404]  Shooting the Black Ski Mask BATF first, which we now know isn't true.
[02:07:13.424 --> 02:07:15.845]  The helicopters and the troops fired first.
[02:07:16.246 --> 02:07:18.647]  And when they put their hands up and quit firing, the Davidians let them leave.
[02:07:18.667 --> 02:07:19.068]  Remember that?
[02:07:19.128 --> 02:07:20.569]  And carry off their dead.
[02:07:23.231 --> 02:07:24.031]  And so that happened.
[02:07:24.352 --> 02:07:25.613]  And so they show her doing that.
[02:07:25.653 --> 02:07:35.420]  But what's really bad about the film is, there was a kennel on the side of the house, a compound, that had Malamutes, or a variant of Huskies, in them.
[02:07:36.346 --> 02:07:38.608]  There were three adults, and I think about eight puppies.
[02:07:41.290 --> 02:07:45.853]  The first thing the BATF did, because they don't like barking, and they admit in Austin, it's the policy.
[02:07:45.873 --> 02:07:48.915]  Your dog's barking at them, unleashed, in your house, they kill it, folks.
[02:07:49.375 --> 02:07:50.216]  But all over our news.
[02:07:50.576 --> 02:07:53.098]  They blew that dog, those dogs, into pieces.
[02:07:53.118 --> 02:07:54.038]  There's photos of this.
[02:07:54.819 --> 02:08:00.363]  And then, after the Davidians stopped firing at them, and let them carry off their dead,
[02:08:01.269 --> 02:08:06.954]  The BATF snuck back up and held up the dead puppies, and squeezed blood out of them.
[02:08:08.135 --> 02:08:09.997]  Now, that's what really happened.
[02:08:10.958 --> 02:08:14.461]  In that made-for-TV movie, the Davidians go, get him!
[02:08:14.801 --> 02:08:18.544]  And release the dogs, and they try to savagely attack the BATF.
[02:08:18.564 --> 02:08:22.368]  But the BATF lovingly just sprays fire extinguishers at them.
[02:08:24.269 --> 02:08:27.012]  I mean, you know, that's the sick warping.
[02:08:27.887 --> 02:08:35.911]  And then I have to hear, you know, from people on the street, well I saw that movie on TV about what they did and they got what they deserved!
[02:08:35.931 --> 02:08:46.996]  I guess those little toddlers whose heads heated up in the fire and popped after they'd already been killed by a shake charge by the Delta Force, I guess they deserved it too then.
[02:08:48.843 --> 02:08:55.872]  But see, we have to deal with those myths because we talk about the news and the bills and what people are doing and that strata of propaganda.
[02:08:56.092 --> 02:09:05.002]  We don't ever spend time on this show talking about the propaganda in movies and on TV and in the comic books and in the children's cartoons and the sitcoms.
[02:09:05.323 --> 02:09:06.785]  It's a hundred times worse!
[02:09:09.258 --> 02:09:12.861]  I talked about this new ABC show coming out called Threat Matrix.
[02:09:12.921 --> 02:09:17.144]  I saw the trailer for it when I went to see a good movie with Kevin Costner, Open Range.
[02:09:17.644 --> 02:09:21.487]  I went to see it and there's this ad and they goes, they're power unlimited.
[02:09:21.767 --> 02:09:23.328]  They're authority unquestioned.
[02:09:23.369 --> 02:09:26.030]  They're unorthodox methods of getting answers.
[02:09:26.551 --> 02:09:30.594]  That shows a guy with tortures and, I don't know, lacerations, burn marks.
[02:09:31.477 --> 02:09:37.798]  Body all purple, head shaved, wires going into him, going, NO!
[02:09:38.098 --> 02:09:41.219]  And the woman's going, ANSWER MY QUESTIONS!
[02:09:41.779 --> 02:09:43.219]  That's why I can't watch TV anymore.
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:50.581]  Psychologically, I've been so much happier and so much more robust not watching it, just reading the text of what they're doing.
[02:09:51.221 --> 02:09:52.241]  But my heart started beating.
[02:09:52.281 --> 02:09:52.882]  I got mad.
[02:09:53.202 --> 02:09:54.462]  I was threatened by that.
[02:09:54.742 --> 02:09:59.883]  I was watching a Nazi production selling evil and torture to the American people.
[02:10:01.664 --> 02:10:02.725]  I began to bow up.
[02:10:02.765 --> 02:10:03.886]  My wife goes, what's wrong?
[02:10:03.926 --> 02:10:04.886]  My heart started beating.
[02:10:05.607 --> 02:10:09.209]  I had an enemy facing me telling me it plans to carry this out.
[02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:11.871]  I had a serial killer telling me this.
[02:10:12.232 --> 02:10:13.352]  That's the equivalent of it.
[02:10:14.873 --> 02:10:19.096]  I had Ted Bundy there on the screen telling me that it was going to warp the minds of everyone.
[02:10:19.437 --> 02:10:20.698]  It makes me angry.
[02:10:20.778 --> 02:10:22.039]  I go into fight mode.
[02:10:23.359 --> 02:10:25.721]  Stop running, folks.
[02:10:25.821 --> 02:10:29.504]  Stand up and fight it and be part of history and stand up against this evil trash.
[02:10:31.511 --> 02:10:33.593]  Let's go to these calls quickly.
[02:10:33.793 --> 02:10:35.294]  Oh man, I don't know who's up next.
[02:10:36.075 --> 02:10:36.275]  Who?
[02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:39.158]  Karen in Missouri.
[02:10:39.198 --> 02:10:40.018]  Karen, you're on the air.
[02:10:40.038 --> 02:10:40.439]  Go ahead.
[02:10:41.079 --> 02:10:42.320]  This is Helen, but anyway.
[02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:43.141]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:10:43.622 --> 02:10:45.904]  I wanted to say a word about the Delphi technique.
[02:10:45.924 --> 02:10:51.248]  You've been talking a lot of things similar to this, you know, of the mind control.
[02:10:52.069 --> 02:10:58.635]  On Saturday night, August the 30th, in our CBS affiliate here, which is Channel 5,
[02:10:59.775 --> 02:11:21.855]  The program, TV program, the district, the federal agent comes to the district, of course if they're referring to District of Columbia Police Chief, and he says, you have to have surveillance cameras installed on all these, all the streets, and he goes into a long diatribe on how it would help him and his
[02:11:23.257 --> 02:11:29.119]  Police investigations to have all this film to review and... And the feds refuse!
[02:11:29.959 --> 02:11:35.400]  See, it's a local thing to have the cameras put in, when in reality it's DARPA putting them in!
[02:11:35.801 --> 02:11:38.781]  Yeah, this was a federal agent that came to the local chief.
[02:11:39.081 --> 02:11:46.264]  Well anyway, the police chief, actually his answers in the beginning were very good as to all the reasons why he shouldn't have them.
[02:11:46.964 --> 02:11:50.805]  And anyway, um, they ended up with the convert, after this
[02:11:52.267 --> 02:11:57.472]  You might say dialogue to consensus, supposedly, in the Delphi Technique.
[02:11:57.913 --> 02:12:02.878]  Megan, I don't like your part of it and telling you in the end that, oh, you chose this when really you didn't.
[02:12:03.238 --> 02:12:09.724]  Well, what the federal agent said, and I wrote down his quote, lead, follow, or get out of my way.
[02:12:10.485 --> 02:12:12.047]  And he said it real nasty.
[02:12:12.961 --> 02:12:15.885]  Well, I guess we'll go ahead and take them then, see?
[02:12:15.905 --> 02:12:18.869]  And all of these shows aren't about.
[02:12:18.889 --> 02:12:19.810]  Torture's good.
[02:12:19.930 --> 02:12:20.831]  Cameras are good.
[02:12:21.172 --> 02:12:22.514]  Breaking up the family's good.
[02:12:22.814 --> 02:12:24.356]  People that own guns are bad.
[02:12:25.237 --> 02:12:26.800]  Every show I turn on is like that.
[02:12:28.201 --> 02:12:31.143]  Don't people know how sinister that is?
[02:12:31.423 --> 02:12:34.685]  They're not even recognizing it when they have it right in front of them.
[02:12:34.765 --> 02:12:39.248]  Well, the neocons, the government knew people would find out it was propaganda, so they went, it's left-wing.
[02:12:39.588 --> 02:12:41.529]  Folks, the military's writing that stuff.
[02:12:41.590 --> 02:12:43.751]  I got Associated Press reports admitting it.
[02:12:44.541 --> 02:12:46.082]  The corporations are using it.
[02:12:46.142 --> 02:12:47.843]  They're using it on government employees.
[02:12:48.383 --> 02:12:50.764]  They're using it... It's mass brainwashing!
[02:12:51.084 --> 02:12:51.664]  Exactly.
[02:12:52.204 --> 02:13:00.008]  They're using it in OBE and they're using it in the church growth movement in the churches on the people right in the congregation.
[02:13:00.288 --> 02:13:01.168]  I know, it's sick.
[02:13:01.248 --> 02:13:02.909]  I mean, folks, this is why I'm freaking out here.
[02:13:04.050 --> 02:13:05.470]  I mean, they're brainwashing everybody.
[02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:06.911]  They're doing it all over the place.
[02:13:06.951 --> 02:13:07.871]  The cameras are good.
[02:13:07.891 --> 02:13:08.852]  The torch is good.
[02:13:09.012 --> 02:13:10.412]  The New World Order is good.
[02:13:10.792 --> 02:13:11.753]  Get out of the way!

[02:16:13.804 --> 02:16:15.786]  Hi, Jack Browner with Midas Resources.
[02:16:16.027 --> 02:16:16.888]  The real money folks.
[02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:19.071]  Remember that ad from October of 2000?
[02:16:19.111 --> 02:16:22.034]  The Nasdaq was down 22% for the year?
[02:16:22.435 --> 02:16:23.797]  Well, it's since gone down another 40%.
[02:16:23.877 --> 02:16:26.100]  Folks, where will it bottom out?
[02:16:26.753 --> 02:16:32.117]  Unfortunately for many of us, the paper markets have already wiped out life savings with no hope of recovery.
[02:16:32.477 --> 02:16:33.598]  Don't let this happen to you.
[02:16:33.918 --> 02:16:35.739]  Call Midas Resources today at 800-686-2237.
[02:16:35.779 --> 02:16:40.542]  Gold Spot at that time was trading at about $275.
[02:16:41.022 --> 02:16:44.164]  It is now up dramatically and looking very bullish.
[02:16:44.425 --> 02:16:49.288]  We recommend it at that time to put a significant portion of your assets into the gold and silver collector coins.
[02:16:49.548 --> 02:16:50.949]  That advice still stands.
[02:16:51.409 --> 02:16:53.211]  Call Midas today, 800-686-2237.
[02:16:55.533 --> 02:16:57.756]  Collector coins are liquid, private, and portable.
[02:16:58.036 --> 02:17:00.679]  Downside risk is minimal in comparison to paper equities.
[02:17:01.019 --> 02:17:05.944]  The time to move to hard assets is now, before the momentum buyers further escalate the prices.
[02:17:06.184 --> 02:17:07.525]  Protect your financial holdings.
[02:17:07.806 --> 02:17:09.307]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:17:16.207 --> 02:17:21.332]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:22.033 --> 02:17:24.415]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:17:24.435 --> 02:17:28.939]  I'm gonna go back to the calls.
[02:17:28.979 --> 02:17:30.060]  You know, you're making a great point.
[02:17:30.140 --> 02:17:31.962]  I don't know how we're supposed to stay calm.
[02:17:32.743 --> 02:17:39.169]  Folks, they're using patented psychological warfare techniques in every TV show I watch.
[02:17:40.035 --> 02:17:46.117]  Especially these cop dramas and shows like The Agency and the rest of it are 24 with Heather Sutherland.
[02:17:46.558 --> 02:17:48.178]  Torture every episode is good.
[02:17:48.758 --> 02:17:50.019]  Government secrecy is good.
[02:17:50.119 --> 02:17:51.620]  Violating the Constitution is good.
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:53.000]  Cameras are good.
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:55.201]  As you just said, every kid needs a microchip.
[02:17:56.041 --> 02:17:58.302]  Frazier's bad because he joins a gun club.
[02:17:58.362 --> 02:17:59.783]  It turns out they are terrorists.
[02:18:00.103 --> 02:18:01.183]  Gun owners are terrorists.
[02:18:01.763 --> 02:18:03.704]  I mean, on and on and on and on.
[02:18:03.784 --> 02:18:05.625]  I don't even watch hardly any of it.
[02:18:06.622 --> 02:18:10.103]  Everything I see has a message to destroy liberty.
[02:18:11.103 --> 02:18:13.184]  And that is a caller in Missouri.
[02:18:13.204 --> 02:18:15.344]  I guess you said it's Helen.
[02:18:15.784 --> 02:18:16.024]  Uh-huh.
[02:18:16.685 --> 02:18:17.585]  Finish up your point.
[02:18:18.165 --> 02:18:30.388]  Oh, I just wanted to add a comment is that for these people in the, I don't care what church you are, and if you've got that church growth movement in your church, you're getting it right in your congregation.
[02:18:30.468 --> 02:18:33.449]  And I can give, but I know you don't have time.
[02:18:34.386 --> 02:18:50.851]  But exactly what happened to me and mine, and I haven't been bit, how you've got to beware of how they start out first by flattering you and then they intimidate you in order to try to shut you up or discredit you.
[02:18:51.611 --> 02:18:54.632]  And just like this federal agent in this program did.
[02:18:56.113 --> 02:18:56.393]  Hello?
[02:18:57.193 --> 02:18:57.934]  I'm listening.
[02:18:58.154 --> 02:18:59.315]  Oh.
[02:18:59.655 --> 02:19:01.616]  There's a bunch of different techniques they use.
[02:19:01.796 --> 02:19:02.657]  Yeah.
[02:19:02.717 --> 02:19:04.518]  I mean, they actually got handbooks on this stuff.
[02:19:04.538 --> 02:19:05.059]  Thanks for the call.
[02:19:05.299 --> 02:19:05.519]  Thanks.
[02:19:05.739 --> 02:19:06.500]  Good to hear from you.
[02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:09.242]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Wesley in Tennessee.
[02:19:09.642 --> 02:19:10.362]  Go ahead, Wesley.
[02:19:10.983 --> 02:19:11.803]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:19:11.903 --> 02:19:13.064]  Good to hear from you today.
[02:19:14.825 --> 02:19:17.067]  I didn't call to give a sermon today.
[02:19:17.407 --> 02:19:26.854]  I just wanted to make this point, and that's with the job that you do in helping break
[02:19:27.486 --> 02:19:33.908]  The chains of slavery that lies and ignorance make out of people.
[02:19:34.508 --> 02:19:56.913]  By telling the truth and exposing the kind of corruption that's going on, you can understand well why the time is approaching when God will finally get up off his throne with fire in his eyes and decide that it is time for him to put a stop
[02:19:58.083 --> 02:19:58.703]  That's a good question.
[02:20:14.238 --> 02:20:22.343]  Time and time again throughout history, people allow eternity to develop, they become decadent and wicked, and then they reap what they sow.
[02:20:22.403 --> 02:20:24.204]  Their own system judges them.
[02:20:24.624 --> 02:20:25.184]  That's the truth.
[02:20:25.544 --> 02:20:26.665]  It's a guarantee.
[02:20:27.105 --> 02:20:29.286]  God doesn't have to get up off of his throne.
[02:20:29.847 --> 02:20:32.508]  He set up the laws of nature.
[02:20:32.808 --> 02:20:33.969]  You reap what you sow.
[02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:39.172]  We can't have a government that lies about everything, that chips the drugs in, that
[02:20:40.023 --> 02:20:48.346]  He's putting poisons in the water and the vaccines and engaging in all forms of genetic engineering and blasphemy and not have that come back on us.
[02:20:49.686 --> 02:21:02.050]  In 1992, when I was at the polling booth, after I was done voting, I stopped to talk to one of the election judges.
[02:21:02.110 --> 02:21:04.550]  This was 1992, 11 years ago.
[02:21:04.570 --> 02:21:09.432]  And I asked the guy, what happened to
[02:21:11.055 --> 02:21:14.418]  The voting machines when the day was done.
[02:21:14.438 --> 02:21:18.122]  I said, do you have a hard copy?
[02:21:19.463 --> 02:21:21.586]  Or a computer tape?
[02:21:21.666 --> 02:21:23.848]  Or just exactly what kind of record?
[02:21:24.088 --> 02:21:25.349]  Okay, and what'd he say?
[02:21:26.310 --> 02:21:32.516]  He said when they're done with the voting at the end of the day, they clear the machines and that's it.
[02:21:35.390 --> 02:21:37.251]  Alright, thanks a lot for the call.
[02:21:37.291 --> 02:21:37.931]  I appreciate it.
[02:21:37.971 --> 02:21:39.912]  Yeah, folks don't know how votes get counted.
[02:21:39.932 --> 02:21:41.872]  They don't know where they go or how it works.
[02:21:42.653 --> 02:21:48.875]  We've now created a big section on PrisonPlanet.com of vote fraud, election fraud.
[02:21:48.895 --> 02:21:50.715]  We're going to add to it as it develops.
[02:21:51.596 --> 02:21:52.256]  Go read it.
[02:21:52.936 --> 02:21:55.677]  There are no more elections in America, okay?
[02:21:56.377 --> 02:21:59.999]  If you have touch screens put in, you don't have an election.
[02:22:00.479 --> 02:22:01.759]  Do you understand?
[02:22:01.819 --> 02:22:03.620]  The CIA runs it.
[02:22:05.487 --> 02:22:10.770]  And they've been caught in these meetings talking about how to keep you from learning about this.
[02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:12.971]  This has come out in the mainstream news, but again, just regionally.
[02:22:13.651 --> 02:22:17.293]  We broke this last week with Bev Harris here on the show, but now the news articles are out.
[02:22:18.774 --> 02:22:19.814]  And this is what they did.
[02:22:20.374 --> 02:22:26.417]  And they said, how do we use the defense complex, the defense contractor's power to suppress this?
[02:22:26.497 --> 02:22:29.979]  Now, who owns ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, all of them?
[02:22:29.999 --> 02:22:31.840]  It's all owned by the military industrial complex.
[02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:33.901]  It's all owned by the defense contractors.
[02:22:35.502 --> 02:22:44.345]  We have them caught on tape with newsreel reporters recording a meeting with industry and private government heads meeting on how to suppress your vote.
[02:22:47.747 --> 02:22:49.667]  And we've caught them involved in elections.
[02:22:50.027 --> 02:22:51.308]  There's been new developments.
[02:22:51.848 --> 02:22:54.049]  I'm going to cover that before this show ends.
[02:22:55.549 --> 02:22:59.711]  And yeah, we're going to get to David and Barney and everybody else.
[02:22:59.771 --> 02:23:00.951]  Just stay with us.
[02:23:01.171 --> 02:23:02.792]  If you're not mad, something's wrong with you.
[02:23:05.490 --> 02:23:08.493]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.413 --> 02:23:12.216]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.438 --> 02:23:17.080]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:17.420 --> 02:23:23.165]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:23:23.405 --> 02:23:26.067]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible.
[02:23:26.107 --> 02:23:31.351]  Water only $14.95 for Congress at your fingertips, $16.95 for who's covering Washington.
[02:23:31.392 --> 02:23:31.612]  That's 877-827-3321.
[02:23:41.419 --> 02:23:47.480]  You know, for a couple weeks I've had it set up, per their request, to show 9-1-1 the road to tyranny and THX 1138.
[02:24:02.981 --> 02:24:08.085]  At the Alamo Drafthouse Movie Theater in Houston at the West Oak Shopping Center, September 11th.
[02:24:08.165 --> 02:24:18.132]  I'm going to do the daytime show live, I'm going to get in the car, I'm going to drive to Houston, and I'm going to do a 30-minute speech at 7 p.m.
[02:24:18.492 --> 02:24:18.872]  sharp.
[02:24:19.693 --> 02:24:22.195]  Then at 7.30 we're going to air Road to Tyranny.
[02:24:23.502 --> 02:24:29.125]  And then at 10 o'clock we're going to air THX 1138 starring Robert Duvall.
[02:24:29.525 --> 02:24:34.148]  It's kind of a Brave New World 1984 dystopic science fiction film.
[02:24:34.668 --> 02:24:38.530]  Very scary and frankly is Illuminati propaganda by George Lucas.
[02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:40.151]  You want to know what they got planned?
[02:24:40.171 --> 02:24:41.072]  This is it folks.
[02:24:41.112 --> 02:24:43.053]  Too much has followed this precisely.
[02:24:43.813 --> 02:24:47.196]  Uh, for it to, uh, be anything but, uh, throwing it in your face.
[02:24:47.256 --> 02:24:50.458]  Like Huxley said, he said, I got all this from my brother in the government.
[02:24:50.478 --> 02:24:51.999]  This is what we're really planning to do to you.
[02:24:52.439 --> 02:24:54.821]  He said that in a speech in 1962 at Berkeley.
[02:24:55.742 --> 02:24:58.443]  We've aired that Huxley speech here on the air, by the way.
[02:24:58.483 --> 02:24:59.064]  It's chilling.
[02:25:00.225 --> 02:25:06.009]  So, please tell everybody, I'm told they've already sold, uh, about, uh, half the seats.
[02:25:06.129 --> 02:25:06.829]  It's a big 300 plus
[02:25:08.547 --> 02:25:09.448]  Seat Theater.
[02:25:09.568 --> 02:25:11.309]  I mean, it's a big, brand new movie theater, folks.
[02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.830]  It's nice.
[02:25:11.930 --> 02:25:18.155]  They got eight screens, but we're going to be in their biggest theater, and they've already pre-sold a lot of them.
[02:25:18.675 --> 02:25:22.799]  So you better go online and buy your tickets.
[02:25:22.859 --> 02:25:28.724]  Seven bucks to get to see both films, and also I'm going to be speaking.
[02:25:30.325 --> 02:25:32.787]  And so there'll be a lot of great folks there, a lot of people to meet.
[02:25:32.907 --> 02:25:36.130]  I haven't even promoted the thing, and it did better than I thought it would.
[02:25:36.190 --> 02:25:36.370]  Wow.
[02:25:38.470 --> 02:25:41.512]  But better get online, better buy your tickets now.
[02:25:43.294 --> 02:25:48.437]  Now, I'm not disparaging you if you don't have internet connection and you're thinking, oh, I'm going to get there and won't be able to get in.
[02:25:49.278 --> 02:25:50.959]  We had standing room last time.
[02:25:50.979 --> 02:25:53.801]  Not the last time, the time before.
[02:25:53.841 --> 02:26:00.667]  It sold out last time too, but the time before we had to turn away like 50 people in Austin with almost no promotion again.
[02:26:00.767 --> 02:26:02.468]  But this thing in Houston,
[02:26:03.981 --> 02:26:10.506]  Just better go to Infowars.com and link through the Alamo Draft House Houston to go ahead and buy your tickets and buy it for others.
[02:26:11.106 --> 02:26:14.009]  But there's over 300 seats available, so they've sold a hundred and something.
[02:26:14.609 --> 02:26:19.373]  There'll be seats for you if you drive there and buy them at the door, but I suggest you do it online.
[02:26:19.533 --> 02:26:25.198]  Even if you don't have, if you're not computer savvy, get your neighbor to for you or whatever.
[02:26:25.258 --> 02:26:28.700]  Because I want to see you all out there, and I look forward to seeing you.
[02:26:29.781 --> 02:26:30.542]  I really, really do.
[02:26:32.228 --> 02:26:35.949]  Now, before I go back to... I'm just going to talk to David and Barney.
[02:26:35.969 --> 02:26:42.110]  That's going to be it for callers, because I do have about 15 articles I've got to at least mention before we end this show.
[02:26:43.050 --> 02:26:46.011]  I want to bring Lord Anderson up.
[02:26:46.431 --> 02:26:47.031]  I'm just joking.
[02:26:47.071 --> 02:26:53.753]  My boss, the chief elf here, busy little worker bee at the network.
[02:26:55.894 --> 02:26:57.615]  I guess you could call him the Grand Keebler.
[02:26:57.675 --> 02:26:58.556]  All right, that's enough jokes.
[02:26:59.196 --> 02:27:01.217]  Ted Anderson is a great guy.
[02:27:01.237 --> 02:27:02.838]  I've never censored this show once.
[02:27:03.419 --> 02:27:04.619]  The guy that founded Genesis.
[02:27:04.959 --> 02:27:06.220]  Because he rarely calls me.
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:12.964]  He said, man, have you heard about this lawsuit against Chase Manhattan and Citibank and others?
[02:27:12.984 --> 02:27:22.550]  Well, this particular one is Blanchard and Company Incorporated against JPMorgan Chase and Company.
[02:27:23.533 --> 02:27:24.835]  And they've been caught red-handed.
[02:27:24.855 --> 02:27:26.297]  This has been going on for three or four years.
[02:27:26.958 --> 02:27:28.540]  Suppressing the price of gold.
[02:27:28.681 --> 02:27:29.322]  And Ted...
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:30.781]  wants to cover.
[02:27:31.101 --> 02:27:34.204]  I have a 30-plus page, what is it, 34-page lawsuit here.
[02:27:34.604 --> 02:27:35.986]  This is why gold's going up.
[02:27:36.306 --> 02:27:40.850]  Because now I even hear it on mainstream news occasionally that there's been some price fixing.
[02:27:41.251 --> 02:27:43.313]  And Ted, major development, tell us all about it.
[02:27:43.553 --> 02:27:47.637]  Oh, I tell you, gold is going bananas today because this publication just came out.
[02:27:47.757 --> 02:27:49.258]  And you're just exactly right on that.
[02:27:49.318 --> 02:27:54.123]  Blanchard & Company and a few of their customers, Herbert Davies and James F. Holmes,
[02:27:54.884 --> 02:28:11.930]  Are suing, believe it or not, the Illuminati, if you will, and you're actually referring to Barrick Gold Corporation, which is the largest gold mining institution in the North American continent, and JP Morgan Chase Company, one of the largest central banks of the world,
[02:28:12.808 --> 02:28:29.930]  What's been going on is the central bank has been lending gold to Barrick Gold Corporation so they can sell it short in the marketplace and then they take the proceeds and give it back to the bank who can then re-lend it out into the system and make a huge profit on the cash
[02:28:30.490 --> 02:28:49.069]  To make this on lending on the interest on the thing because the lease rates are running at about 1.1%, 1.5% depending upon the time for the gold to be leased to Barrick Corporation and then they turn it back over to the bank after the gold is sold into the marketplace.
[02:28:49.529 --> 02:28:58.676]  And they get like six and a half percent return, and then of course Barrick is going to be out there trying to dig up the gold to deliver it at some later date, some like 15 years down the road.
[02:28:58.996 --> 02:29:01.017]  And actually, you said they've been doing this for about three years?
[02:29:01.898 --> 02:29:06.081]  They've been controlling the gold market this way for... I'm just saying the lawsuit's been going on for three years.
[02:29:06.221 --> 02:29:13.386]  Yeah, well they actually, the GATA lawsuit came in that long, and this one here more recently filed.
[02:29:13.886 --> 02:29:23.094]  Now, Gatta was the big... the gold mining operations that were being bankrupted, and the bankers would come in and say, we'll buy you out.
[02:29:23.114 --> 02:29:28.158]  They were trying to create a semi-monopoly like Nicky Oppenheimer has with De Beers.
[02:29:28.559 --> 02:29:31.842]  Yeah, that's exactly right, except we're in the gold market here, and they've been doing that.
[02:29:31.862 --> 02:29:36.325]  That's why Barrick Corporation has got such a great big hold on the gold mining industry.
[02:29:36.826 --> 02:29:41.390]  And as a matter of fact, they are the only gold mining bank
[02:29:41.911 --> 02:29:47.542]  A gold mining company that has the ability to work with JP Morgan and Chase Company.
[02:29:48.357 --> 02:29:49.158]  And there is no other.
[02:29:49.178 --> 02:29:50.499]  There's no competition at all.
[02:29:50.539 --> 02:29:52.540]  So this whole thing has been suppressing gold.
[02:29:52.800 --> 02:29:57.363]  When we've seen gold going down there to 248 amounts, that was because of this.
[02:29:57.424 --> 02:30:01.306]  The first time we saw gold jump up was when GATA put their lawsuit in.
[02:30:01.747 --> 02:30:12.054]  GATA's lawsuit never made it to court, but this one here with individuals being harmed and Jim Blanchard being in there involved and so on and so forth, this one's going to see its day in court.
[02:30:12.514 --> 02:30:17.358]  And you know darn well that the market is answering right now that this is quite obvious.
[02:30:17.918 --> 02:30:21.181]  And I'm not just saying this because we're selling gold, Ted.
[02:30:21.902 --> 02:30:27.266]  I mean, Ron Paul has nothing to do with us, and he's coming back on tomorrow, the next day.
[02:30:27.286 --> 02:30:28.407]  I haven't talked to my producer yet.
[02:30:28.427 --> 02:30:31.870]  I was told I think it's tomorrow, via the board operators.
[02:30:32.291 --> 02:30:37.556]  But what happened is, Ron Paul gets up and says, we're going to have a depression, buy gold.
[02:30:37.916 --> 02:30:40.478]  Now, John Stapmiller aired the clip on his radio show.
[02:30:40.638 --> 02:30:41.339]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:30:42.114 --> 02:30:43.917]  And folks, I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:30:43.997 --> 02:30:46.760]  I just know I'm concerned about my family.
[02:30:47.001 --> 02:30:50.405]  I've moved into gold the last few years, already more than I was.
[02:30:51.126 --> 02:30:53.509]  And it's a lot better than fiat currency.
[02:30:53.549 --> 02:30:55.912]  The new colored money comes out October 9th.
[02:30:56.920 --> 02:30:57.881]  I've got a report right here.
[02:30:57.961 --> 02:31:00.984]  Financial Times of London on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:31:01.444 --> 02:31:03.225]  Asian debt withdrawal, threat to U.S.
[02:31:03.265 --> 02:31:03.726]  deficit.
[02:31:04.026 --> 02:31:07.769]  Economists fear that Asian investors, who are the largest foreign owners of U.S.
[02:31:07.829 --> 02:31:10.131]  treasuries, may cut their holdings of U.S.
[02:31:10.171 --> 02:31:15.956]  government debt, withdrawing a key source of financing for America's large current account deficit.
[02:31:16.457 --> 02:31:20.140]  The worries have been fueled by recent sharp falls in the price of U.S.
[02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:21.441]  government debt.
[02:31:22.139 --> 02:31:22.680]  And it goes on...
[02:31:34.252 --> 02:31:36.654]  Folks, this is serious business.
[02:31:36.734 --> 02:31:49.883]  And Ted, you're offering free the 34-page lawsuit by Blanchard & Company, Herbert Davis, James F. Holmes, versus Barrick Gold Corporation, JPMorgan Chase Company, and ABC Companies.
[02:31:50.083 --> 02:31:50.663]  ABC.
[02:31:51.764 --> 02:31:52.364]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:31:52.384 --> 02:31:53.665]  They can get the report for free.
[02:31:53.805 --> 02:31:58.128]  I'll send that out because I want you guys to be informed, make informed decisions on your investing.
[02:31:58.706 --> 02:32:03.270]  But then, you know, you take a look at, you're talking about analysts and what's going on in the marketplace here.
[02:32:03.330 --> 02:32:11.077]  If you take a look at writers right now, there's a big story right now where the gold charts push gold above $390 an ounce.
[02:32:11.537 --> 02:32:15.741]  I was also taking a look at the Dow Jones Newswire.
[02:32:16.321 --> 02:32:18.002]  And they're looking for gold to be over $400.
[02:32:18.102 --> 02:32:27.225]  Bottom line, when they pull the rug out, whether it's next month or 50 years from now, and it's going to be sooner than that, your gold's going to explode in price, but you're not going to want to sell it.
[02:32:27.345 --> 02:32:34.828]  Well, this is obviously a very embarrassing moment for the Chase Manhattan people.
[02:32:34.869 --> 02:32:37.550]  And we want you to get this to every talk show in your area.
[02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:43.392]  We want you to go find out about this major lawsuit with some of the biggest banks in the country manipulating gold prices.
[02:32:43.672 --> 02:32:44.352]  For decades.
[02:32:44.632 --> 02:32:44.832]  Yep.
[02:32:45.033 --> 02:32:53.115]  And of course, Alex, you talked about, you know, we do sell gold, and there is something that I can offer you right now, because gold is up in the $3.80 level now.
[02:32:53.515 --> 02:32:55.956]  Gold just yesterday was in the $3.60s.
[02:32:56.156 --> 02:32:58.157]  Just a couple years ago, we're down to $250.
[02:32:58.337 --> 02:33:07.200]  I mean, folks, while you're watching the stock market crash, and your 401k plans disappear, gold has been going up almost 50% now.
[02:33:07.260 --> 02:33:11.842]  Here's what we have to offer, Alex, and I really suggest that your listeners consider this offer.
[02:33:12.262 --> 02:33:29.899]  If you don't want to get the gold just call up and get the brochure but I really highly recommend that you take and it's really not a brochure what is it's a legal document out of a out of a court case but you know that way you can take a look at what's going on in the marketplace but we have $10 gold pieces right now what Jack is always talking about
[02:33:30.479 --> 02:33:39.404]  I was able to get a position where I can get 20 different dates or mint marks that date all the way back into the 1800s for these ten dollar livers.
[02:33:39.424 --> 02:33:40.645]  These are semi-numismatic.
[02:33:40.705 --> 02:33:43.066]  It's not also pretty close to bullion price.
[02:33:43.086 --> 02:33:44.627]  You also get a collector's value.
[02:33:44.687 --> 02:33:50.210]  That's the nice part about that is you don't get caught up in that 60-45 ruling that the Internal Revenue Service has.
[02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:51.171]  Which makes it private.
[02:33:51.391 --> 02:33:51.991]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:33:52.011 --> 02:33:54.772]  You don't have to turn in your social security numbers and all that stuff.
[02:33:54.893 --> 02:33:57.294]  And now here you're looking at
[02:33:57.814 --> 02:34:07.261]  I've got half rolls of 10, so obviously there's only going to be 10 different dates or mint marks in those rolls, and those are $2,831 per roll.
[02:34:07.661 --> 02:34:13.405]  I also have the full rolls of $10 gold pieces right now available at $5,648.
[02:34:13.726 --> 02:34:15.527]  That's 20 different dates.
[02:34:15.807 --> 02:34:16.988]  How much is that per coin?
[02:34:17.128 --> 02:34:19.790]  Well, okay, well then that's going to be $283 approximately per coin.
[02:34:23.662 --> 02:34:25.503]  That's some quick mathematics.
[02:34:25.824 --> 02:34:27.846]  You must have gone to public school when it was still good.
[02:34:27.926 --> 02:34:29.467]  Well, that's right.
[02:34:29.507 --> 02:34:33.431]  It's easy to multiply and divide by 10, and it's 2831 per 10.
[02:34:34.292 --> 02:34:43.961]  Well, seriously, folks, if you call and want this 35-page lawsuit filed September 3rd, 2003, it's even got the filing date on it, and it's interesting reading.
[02:34:45.021 --> 02:34:48.523]  Or, we are going to send out the Arnold Schwarzenegger news article that I wrote.
[02:34:49.063 --> 02:34:53.325]  It's on InfoWars.com, but Ted will actually add one of those in there if you want to do this as well.
[02:34:54.065 --> 02:34:57.046]  So you can pass that out to people, especially if you're not online.
[02:34:57.767 --> 02:34:58.887]  Call right now.
[02:34:59.027 --> 02:35:02.649]  And Ted, what's the number for this particular offer?
[02:35:02.749 --> 02:35:04.269]  Well, the number for this offer is 888-294-6187.
[02:35:04.329 --> 02:35:04.530]  That's 888-294-6187.
[02:35:11.319 --> 02:35:30.026]  294-6187 folks if you want to see the big boys getting the black eye right now this is one of the few times that you can actually see it happen where the judge is actually going to let the court case go through and it will be heard and these people will be taking on Chase Manhattan, the big bank that started this whole thing.
[02:35:30.026 --> 02:35:37.469]  And for those who don't know, if this happens, there's not enough physical gold to make delivery on deals they already set years ago to keep prices down.
[02:35:37.549 --> 02:35:50.455]  Well, just the deal that they have going between American Barrick and Chase Manhattan, JPMorgan Chase Manhattan Company, is more than 100 times larger than the physical gold market itself.
[02:35:50.515 --> 02:35:52.556]  So how in the world are they controlling the market?
[02:35:52.896 --> 02:35:54.137]  Well, think about this, folks.
[02:35:54.497 --> 02:35:57.398]  Futures, options, that's how they're doing it.
[02:35:57.478 --> 02:36:05.405]  Well, yeah, it's a derivative that actually accelerates the amount of gold that's trading to a hundred times more than what's physically able to be traded.
[02:36:05.425 --> 02:36:07.346]  But they turned this into fractional reserve banking.
[02:36:07.647 --> 02:36:12.571]  They did this to leverage so they could buy up all gold that's not in private hands.
[02:36:12.831 --> 02:36:14.192]  This is serious business, folks.
[02:36:14.212 --> 02:36:15.253]  Give them the number again, Ted.
[02:36:15.333 --> 02:36:16.374]  Well, the number again is 888-294-7000.
[02:36:19.736 --> 02:36:22.498]  6187.
[02:36:19.877 --> 02:36:22.498]  That's 888-294-6187.
[02:36:22.639 --> 02:36:28.583]  This is your opportunity to read about a real lawsuit that's really going to be taking on the banking system.
[02:36:29.043 --> 02:36:30.924]  And it's a very big embarrassment for them.
[02:36:30.964 --> 02:36:35.187]  And it's also one of the few... Yeah, believe me folks, we've given stories legs here before.
[02:36:35.247 --> 02:36:37.389]  They do not want the story having legs.
[02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:41.232]  So if you call, they can also point you to web addresses where you can find this document.
[02:36:41.272 --> 02:36:44.314]  I'm going to be posting it on InfoWars.com later today.
[02:36:44.734 --> 02:36:45.935]  But you need to call Ted.
[02:36:45.955 --> 02:36:47.296]  You need to get a copy of this.
[02:36:47.316 --> 02:36:48.277]  We'll mail it out to you.
[02:36:48.617 --> 02:36:49.198]  Quick time.
[02:36:49.218 --> 02:36:52.200]  You need to get it out to everybody because I was standing over it this morning.
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:53.801]  It's a very interesting reading.
[02:36:53.861 --> 02:36:54.662]  Ted, that number again.
[02:36:55.002 --> 02:36:57.724]  It's 888-294-6187.
[02:36:57.884 --> 02:37:01.627]  That's 888-294-6187.
[02:37:01.967 --> 02:37:13.196]  And by calling that particular number, when that goes through on the phone system, when it goes to the broker's desk, it flashes up that it's about this deal, this document, so folks know what's going on.
[02:37:13.236 --> 02:37:14.057]  That's why you call that number.
[02:37:14.617 --> 02:37:18.520]  Yep, you bet, and I'll make sure I get that other document about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:20.161]  Yeah, I want to expose this Nazi punk.
[02:37:20.781 --> 02:37:21.081]  Okay.
[02:37:21.422 --> 02:37:22.122]  I appreciate it, Ted.
[02:37:22.142 --> 02:37:23.103]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:37:23.163 --> 02:37:23.483]  You bet.
[02:37:23.543 --> 02:37:24.323]  Thank you so much.
[02:37:24.463 --> 02:37:33.329]  I hope everybody gets that, too, because, I mean, it's just sick what this guy does, and all the disgusting stuff he's involved in, and how the phony conservatives call him conservative.
[02:37:34.010 --> 02:37:35.791]  But, yeah, that's all right there.
[02:37:35.831 --> 02:37:36.331]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:37:37.052 --> 02:37:40.934]  All right, I'm going to go to David and Barney here in just a second.
[02:37:41.174 --> 02:37:41.895]  Okay, next segment.
[02:37:42.335 --> 02:37:43.856]  I've got to cover some more of this news, folks.
[02:37:45.612 --> 02:37:47.093]  It's got to be done.
[02:37:47.433 --> 02:37:48.173]  It's got to be done.
[02:37:48.193 --> 02:37:53.236]  They're now telling people who were in the reserves that got sent to Iraq, you may not come back for years.
[02:37:54.277 --> 02:37:55.817]  This is out of the Washington Post.
[02:37:56.938 --> 02:37:57.578]  It's horrible.
[02:37:58.099 --> 02:37:59.379]  I mean, talk about enslaving them.
[02:37:59.900 --> 02:38:01.140]  California crowd.
[02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:04.742]  Hospital Schwarzenegger's wife out there learning about them.
[02:38:04.802 --> 02:38:08.064]  New peach-colored $20 bills to make debut October 9th.
[02:38:08.084 --> 02:38:09.905]  This is out of, what is this, Reuters?
[02:38:11.235 --> 02:38:13.195]  The new peach-cued U.S.
[02:38:13.676 --> 02:38:15.056]  20s will be introduced at U.S.
[02:38:15.136 --> 02:38:16.616]  banks and businesses October 9th.
[02:38:16.676 --> 02:38:18.157]  Officials plan to announce today.
[02:38:18.237 --> 02:38:19.757]  Tuesday's Wall Street Journal reported.
[02:38:20.137 --> 02:38:25.898]  That's so they can physically restrict the money supply to a level that's so low you can't physically pay back debts.
[02:38:26.239 --> 02:38:27.399]  Very serious news there.
[02:38:27.919 --> 02:38:31.960]  Huge news section on PrisonPlanet.com on election fraud.
[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:34.581]  Those who cast the votes decide nothing.
[02:38:34.881 --> 02:38:36.561]  Those who count the votes decide everything.
[02:38:36.681 --> 02:38:38.001]  Russian dictator Joseph Stalin.
[02:38:38.441 --> 02:38:40.542]  We have secret meetings of the black box
[02:38:41.282 --> 02:38:49.146]  Leaders with the CIA and others got audio clips, mainstream news articles, key analysis documents, inside a U.S.
[02:38:49.206 --> 02:39:01.952]  election vote counting program, we've got a problem, black folks voting secrets, bigger than Watergate, how to rig an election in the United States, that's all on my website, the newest article out of the Associated Press,
[02:39:03.522 --> 02:39:08.703]  Cachino, eight other counties to get rid of punch card voting.
[02:39:08.783 --> 02:39:10.564]  Punch card voting equipment still in use.
[02:39:11.004 --> 02:39:15.145]  Arizona counties will be replaced with optical scanners under a new contract.
[02:39:15.165 --> 02:39:16.105]  And those are just as bad.
[02:39:16.145 --> 02:39:17.405]  Those are computerized as well.
[02:39:18.245 --> 02:39:20.106]  And that's die-bold election systems.
[02:39:20.146 --> 02:39:22.606]  The same ones caught in with the CIA and everybody else.
[02:39:23.247 --> 02:39:24.187]  Very serious there.
[02:39:24.227 --> 02:39:26.447]  But some other areas are throwing out the touchscreens.
[02:39:26.487 --> 02:39:27.227]  Now they're in trouble.
[02:39:27.968 --> 02:39:29.288]  Dr. David Kelly's open
[02:39:30.619 --> 02:39:33.420]  E-mails open fresh mystery out of London Guardian.
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:41.064]  Turns out Dr. David Kelley complained about his telephone calls mysteriously dying when he tried to answer calls in May 2000 with the media.
[02:39:41.804 --> 02:39:45.405]  The month the new weapons dossier affair began.
[02:39:45.806 --> 02:39:51.828]  He complained to friends about dark actors, harassment, phone calls going down when he was talking to members of the media.
[02:39:52.728 --> 02:39:54.169]  What happened with Ron Paul yesterday?
[02:39:57.090 --> 02:39:57.791]  It goes on.
[02:39:59.346 --> 02:40:02.430]  And by that, I mean every time we've got some key, super key guest on.
[02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:04.352]  Another talk show host have talked about this.
[02:40:04.832 --> 02:40:09.157]  Or I'll be talking on some big radio show, and you know, the phone lines go out.
[02:40:09.177 --> 02:40:12.781]  I don't want to get off into conspiracy theories, but that's what Dr. David Kelly was saying.
[02:40:14.349 --> 02:40:15.030]  On 11 p.m.
[02:40:15.070 --> 02:40:27.361]  on May 9th, three days after David Kelly told Newsnight reporter Susan Watts over the phone that the September dossier presented facts in black and white way, he received an email from someone who had been trying to call him.
[02:40:27.901 --> 02:40:30.403]  I tried several times, my phone connected, but it went dead.
[02:40:30.423 --> 02:40:33.646]  I wasn't sure if you were having problems with your phone, said Dr. Kelly.
[02:40:34.046 --> 02:40:35.968]  Unnamed correspondent in the email exchange.
[02:40:36.789 --> 02:40:37.650]  And it goes on and on.
[02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:41.433]  So he says he was being harassed, dark actors, his phone calls being intercepted.
[02:40:42.779 --> 02:40:44.060]  And give me a break.
[02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:44.920]  Here's another one.
[02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:49.042]  Rich firms got 9-1-1 fund millions.
[02:40:49.722 --> 02:41:01.827]  More than a third of the funds aimed at helping small businessmen located near the World Trade Center that survived destruction of September 11th went to rich firms, the New York Times says.
[02:41:02.127 --> 02:41:02.767]  Here's another one.
[02:41:04.184 --> 02:41:06.826]  9-1-1 conspiracy theories gaining ground.
[02:41:06.846 --> 02:41:09.328]  This is out of Germany, out of the post.
[02:41:09.808 --> 02:41:17.213]  Conspiracy theories on the September 11th attack are gaining ground in Germany two years on with books claiming that the U.S.
[02:41:17.253 --> 02:41:21.055]  government was behind the atrocities, claiming best-seller list!
[02:41:23.136 --> 02:41:23.376]  Oh!
[02:41:23.396 --> 02:41:27.319]  More on this when we get back and some other key tidbits.
[02:41:27.359 --> 02:41:28.560]  And we will go to David and Barney.
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:30.000]  Stay with us.
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:30.841]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:32.780 --> 02:41:35.121]  On the other side.
[02:41:35.922 --> 02:41:40.284]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:40.444 --> 02:41:44.866]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.026 --> 02:41:49.388]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:49.448 --> 02:41:50.789]  The New World Order.
[02:41:51.562 --> 02:41:52.483]  Panama.
[02:41:52.583 --> 02:41:56.805]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:56.865 --> 02:42:03.810]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:03.930 --> 02:42:05.971]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:06.292 --> 02:42:16.718]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:16.938 --> 02:42:19.460]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:20.701]  This is my new two and a half hour video.
[02:42:20.721 --> 02:42:22.322]  Police Day 3 is for you!

[02:43:33.233 --> 02:43:34.615]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:43:35.215 --> 02:43:36.737]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:43:36.917 --> 02:43:38.018]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:43:38.218 --> 02:43:41.642]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:43:41.742 --> 02:43:42.182]  Phenol!
[02:43:42.483 --> 02:43:49.610]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:51.812]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and you
[02:43:51.852 --> 02:43:53.493]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calden shampoo.
[02:44:07.538 --> 02:44:10.960]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:44:11.100 --> 02:44:14.661]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:44:14.861 --> 02:44:17.222]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:44:17.382 --> 02:44:18.263]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:44:41.185 --> 02:44:45.528]  Alright folks, final segment.
[02:44:46.088 --> 02:44:48.389]  Police seek DNA record of everyone.
[02:44:49.370 --> 02:44:51.911]  And they've called for it in this country, they've called for it in England too.
[02:44:52.772 --> 02:45:00.236]  And it just so happens that all children for the last 33 years at birth have blood taken out of their heel and sent to the federal government.
[02:45:00.857 --> 02:45:10.002]  London Guardian senior police officers will call this week for the national database of DNA samples to be extended to everyone in the country.
[02:45:10.709 --> 02:45:12.950]  And to get an ID card, you'll have to give blood.
[02:45:13.030 --> 02:45:17.232]  Funny, Bill Clinton signed an executive order to do that back in 1997.
[02:45:18.332 --> 02:45:21.154]  That's in my film, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:45:22.134 --> 02:45:23.234]  It's all unified.
[02:45:23.875 --> 02:45:26.076]  They passed the laws decades before they do it.
[02:45:27.076 --> 02:45:31.458]  Again, it says in major polls now in Germany, a majority of Germans believe the U.S.
[02:45:31.478 --> 02:45:32.658]  government carried out September 11th.
[02:45:35.001 --> 02:45:51.510]  And it says, thanks to a handful of non-fiction works in bookstores, wild accusations have gradually become part of public database debate among a sizable group in Germany, home to the so-called Hamburg cell that in 2001 produced three of the suicide hijackers.
[02:45:52.754 --> 02:45:53.314]  And it goes on.
[02:45:53.694 --> 02:46:00.397]  You want to find out the truth, folks, not the rumors, not the conspiracy theories, the facts, get Horror Out of Chaos, the new book I've published.
[02:46:00.777 --> 02:46:02.818]  Get Descent into Tyranny, the book I wrote.
[02:46:03.138 --> 02:46:05.379]  Get my film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:46:05.619 --> 02:46:06.660]  Get Masters of Terror.
[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:07.840]  Get Police State 3.
[02:46:09.141 --> 02:46:16.704]  I mean, mainstream news around the world, where the British carry out the terror attacks, where our government carries out the terror attacks, to blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:46:17.764 --> 02:46:20.065]  We got handbooks, official government documents.
[02:46:20.805 --> 02:46:23.606]  They've got a new horrible smoking vaccine the U.N.
[02:46:23.646 --> 02:46:25.206]  might want to make mandatory.
[02:46:26.306 --> 02:46:28.766]  BBC's smoking vaccine is a step closer.
[02:46:28.826 --> 02:46:31.327]  Can you imagine something that can change brain chemistry?
[02:46:31.367 --> 02:46:32.367]  How deadly that is?
[02:46:33.127 --> 02:46:38.288]  They want to set up a bureaucracy now called BioShield to forcibly inject you.
[02:46:38.308 --> 02:46:42.949]  9-1-1 tape features top Bush and DOD officials meeting during the hijackings.
[02:46:43.809 --> 02:46:45.170]  That's out of Newsmax.
[02:46:45.310 --> 02:46:46.690]  Oh yeah, but they won't release that.
[02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:47.150]  Oh no.
[02:46:48.833 --> 02:46:52.595]  David in California, then Debbie, and we'll try to get to Barney.
[02:46:52.636 --> 02:46:53.896]  I know he's been holding for a while.
[02:46:54.176 --> 02:46:54.857]  Go ahead, David.
[02:46:55.517 --> 02:46:56.118]  Hey, hi, Alex.
[02:46:56.338 --> 02:46:58.899]  You know, I just had a brief question to ask you.
[02:46:58.919 --> 02:47:08.325]  I was calling some of the other people who get on the Internet, might listen to WJNO down in Florida, and Randy Rhodes is pretty good down there.
[02:47:08.965 --> 02:47:11.587]  And we were talking about this Karl Rove business.
[02:47:13.228 --> 02:47:14.529]  You've probably covered this.
[02:47:15.799 --> 02:47:28.610]  The Ambassador White, his wife, was outed by Karl Rove, and she was a CIA agent and was apparently involved in studying nuclear issues.
[02:47:29.191 --> 02:47:34.295]  And, let's see, I think, what's it, Al Martin has got a... Yeah, that came out.
[02:47:35.136 --> 02:47:36.817]  We've talked about that, so what's the point?
[02:47:37.058 --> 02:47:40.881]  Well, let's see, Al Martin is claiming that 70 agents died.
[02:47:41.425 --> 02:47:43.727]  And she was not aware that anyone had died.
[02:47:43.747 --> 02:47:49.270]  She was just under the impression that these people had been outed and in trouble.
[02:47:49.810 --> 02:48:00.437]  And so I'm just wondering if you had any... Yeah, Cole Rove does whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and his lapdog, Lionel Chatwin, threatened me in a bathroom in Hollywood.
[02:48:00.477 --> 02:48:01.598]  Yeah, I caught that, yeah.
[02:48:01.898 --> 02:48:02.798]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[02:48:03.019 --> 02:48:04.079]  I'm taking it very serious.
[02:48:04.239 --> 02:48:07.882]  I'm wondering if you knew if... I'm going to let you go.
[02:48:07.902 --> 02:48:08.702]  We're out of time.
[02:48:08.742 --> 02:48:09.883]  Debbie in Texas, go ahead.
[02:48:11.226 --> 02:48:12.207]  Call me back tomorrow, David.
[02:48:12.267 --> 02:48:12.928]  Debbie, go ahead.
[02:48:14.209 --> 02:48:14.589]  Hello?
[02:48:14.810 --> 02:48:16.411]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:48:16.491 --> 02:48:23.078]  I was just calling to find out, I know you're covering a lot about the election fraud.
[02:48:25.540 --> 02:48:29.484]  Have you done any coverage on the special election here in Texas for this Saturday?
[02:48:29.504 --> 02:48:33.008]  Oh, how they're going to gut the Bill of Rights of the state?
[02:48:34.452 --> 02:48:37.733]  Well, yeah, the amendments, the Constitution.
[02:48:37.773 --> 02:48:39.814]  Yeah, they're slaughtering all freedom.
[02:48:39.834 --> 02:48:41.234]  They're destroying everything right now.
[02:48:41.714 --> 02:48:44.935]  Well, do you have any points about... Well, I do.
[02:48:45.075 --> 02:48:47.255]  The problem is... Or is there no point in voting?
[02:48:47.295 --> 02:48:50.056]  The problem is I've got 30 seconds left.
[02:48:50.416 --> 02:48:50.936]  What is it about?
[02:48:50.956 --> 02:48:53.317]  I think about 20% of the counties have got touchscreens now.
[02:48:53.617 --> 02:48:55.337]  By next year, they're saying it's going to be half.
[02:48:55.638 --> 02:48:57.838]  Within two years, it'll be all machines touchscreen.
[02:48:58.238 --> 02:48:59.479]  There was always election fraud.
[02:48:59.499 --> 02:49:01.059]  Look at LBJ right here in Texas.
[02:49:01.759 --> 02:49:04.360]  You know, with stuff and ballots.
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:08.902]  But I don't know the full scale of what's going on with the regular systems.
[02:49:09.062 --> 02:49:11.643]  I know these touchscreens are run by the government.
[02:49:12.163 --> 02:49:13.203]  And I know they're a fraud.
[02:49:13.243 --> 02:49:13.904]  Thanks for the call.
[02:49:14.284 --> 02:49:15.344]  I'm sorry to Barney and others.
[02:49:15.424 --> 02:49:16.185]  I'm out of time.
[02:49:16.205 --> 02:49:17.925]  Be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:17.965 --> 02:49:18.906]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:49:20.086 --> 02:49:22.287]  And I'll see you in Houston this September 11th.
[02:49:23.267 --> 02:49:24.708]  Have a good day.
[02:49:26.411 --> 02:49:37.224]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available in each...
