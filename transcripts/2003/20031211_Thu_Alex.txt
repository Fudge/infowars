[00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:06.656]  We're good to go.
[00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:43.722]  All right, my friends, folks listening worldwide, all the ships at sea, it is Thursday, the 11th day of December, 2003.
[00:00:44.203 --> 00:00:53.586]  We have Phyllis Shafley, the founder and the head honcho at the Eagle Forum, joining us halfway into the next hour.
[00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.647]  Tomorrow, we've got Tom Tancredo.
[00:00:56.593 --> 00:01:07.216]  Coming on to talk about, the congressman coming on to talk about Governor Ridge, the head of Homeland Security, the Heinrich Himmler of the New World Order today here in the U.S.
[00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:12.158]  Governor Ridge has said that, hey, he wants to legalize all the illegals.
[00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:15.639]  And this is upsetting conservatives.
[00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.320]  They're finally waking up to some of this, along with Bush saying, Taiwan, we're cutting you loose.
[00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:26.846]  But we've got Tom Tancredo coming on to talk about all the open borders developments tomorrow.
[00:01:26.906 --> 00:01:31.468]  Today we have Phyllis Shafley from the Eagle Forum.
[00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:40.132]  And this network, of course, carries her daily commentaries, her little three-and-a-half-minute vignettes that she does that are always insightful and informative.
[00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:44.874]  But we'll talk to Phyllis Shafley coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:46.995]  Of course, we'll have open phones as well.
[00:01:47.755 --> 00:01:52.557]  And we're about to dive straight into all the vital news and information, so strap yourselves in.
[00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:59.919]  The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:05.801]  British intelligence helped paramilitaries bomb Northern Ireland.
[00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:09.922]  That's the London Guardian headline from today.
[00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:15.074]  Now, you can't spell out government-sponsored terrorism any clearer than that, can you?
[00:02:15.714 --> 00:02:22.278]  It's already come out that almost every major bombing in the last 24 years has been British intelligence.
[00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:31.564]  And they do the kneecappings and torture others to force them to continue fighting, to keep the Protestants and the Catholics at each other's throats.
[00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:35.503]  Again, we're just talking about the documented stuff that's happening.
[00:02:35.543 --> 00:02:36.483]  That's coming up.
[00:02:36.603 --> 00:02:37.804]  Our government does the same stuff.
[00:02:38.364 --> 00:02:43.427]  Al Qaeda, that means CIA, plans great event in the new year.
[00:02:43.507 --> 00:02:47.729]  Bin Laden reportedly to speak on tape broadcast by Al Jazeera.
[00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.070]  Yeah, right.
[00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:58.455]  Also, Atlanta okays anti-terror cops, encourages public to report suspicious activity, federalization at the local level.
[00:02:59.461 --> 00:03:09.024]  We'll also explode the myth of church-state separation, and I have a synopsis here, due to listeners requesting it, that we'll go over.
[00:03:09.784 --> 00:03:10.584]  Here's one of them.
[00:03:10.684 --> 00:03:11.804]  In Texas, a U.S.
[00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:20.807]  district judge decreed that any student uttering the word Jesus at his school graduation would be arrested and locked up, and make no mistake,
[00:03:21.347 --> 00:03:23.188]  Announce Judge Samuel B. Kent.
[00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:27.369]  The court is going to have the United States Marshal in attendance at the graduation.
[00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:35.631]  If any student offends this court, the student will be summarily arrested and will face up to six months incarceration in Galveston County Jail for contempt of court.
[00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:38.351]  I'll tell you, if I was a student, I'd say the name Jesus.
[00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:43.973]  Again, church and state, the way they manipulated it means the school couldn't say a prayer.
[00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:49.234]  Not somebody in their own acceptance speech of an award or valedictorian.
[00:03:50.842 --> 00:03:57.005]  But again, now there's examples here of kindergartners saying God is great, God is good, let us thank him for our food.
[00:03:57.285 --> 00:03:58.265]  They're being grabbed.
[00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:05.548]  It's thought crime, folks, but you can run around engaging in witchcraft activities all you want if you love Harry Potter.
[00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:07.869]  So we'll get into that.
[00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.471]  Also video surveillance on the rise, more on the cameras in the school bathrooms.
[00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:17.828]  We will get into Ridge's immigration remarks drawing fire about open borders.
[00:04:18.188 --> 00:04:22.130]  President's rebuke of Taiwan stirs alarm among conservatives.
[00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.550]  L.A.
[00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.130]  Times.
[00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:27.592]  China says they appreciate Bush's comments on Taiwan.
[00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:32.194]  Also, communist Chinese are buying up a bunch of American media.
[00:04:32.894 --> 00:04:34.095]  So is the Carlyle Group.
[00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:37.723]  And a lot more coming up.
[00:04:37.863 --> 00:04:40.365]  Believe me, it's all extremely vital.
[00:04:40.805 --> 00:04:45.548]  Details of what we just mentioned and more on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:45.628 --> 00:04:55.735]  Again, the website is www.infowars.com.
[00:04:56.575 --> 00:04:58.256]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.356 --> 00:04:59.057]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.948 --> 00:05:07.773]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.093 --> 00:05:09.454]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.655 --> 00:05:11.856]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.016 --> 00:05:14.098]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:19.322]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.662 --> 00:05:23.685]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:23.965 --> 00:05:25.846]  And man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:05:25.906 --> 00:05:26.626]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:47.657 --> 00:05:54.703]  That's 888-253-3139 or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:05:55.003 --> 00:05:55.703]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.123 --> 00:06:00.723]  Hello, folks.
[00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:01.704]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.084 --> 00:06:07.827]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:08.087 --> 00:06:13.209]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:22.853]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:06:23.194 --> 00:06:28.136]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:06:28.456 --> 00:06:32.498]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:37.481]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:43.705]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.381]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:06:59.923 --> 00:07:02.425]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:03.005]  Pollution.
[00:07:03.045 --> 00:07:03.326]  Pollen.
[00:07:03.366 --> 00:07:04.466]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:07:04.546 --> 00:07:04.947]  Allergies.
[00:07:05.087 --> 00:07:05.367]  Asthma.
[00:07:05.407 --> 00:07:05.967]  Probably not.
[00:07:06.128 --> 00:07:06.848]  Well, listen to this.
[00:07:07.088 --> 00:07:16.055]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:16.956]  Six to ten times?
[00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:18.056]  How could that be, you ask?
[00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:18.397]  Worse.
[00:07:18.497 --> 00:07:19.818]  Think about what's inside your home.
[00:07:19.998 --> 00:07:20.658]  Air spray.
[00:07:20.758 --> 00:07:21.259]  Chemicals.
[00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:22.260]  Does anyone smoke?
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.500]  Fumes.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.361]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:26.363]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:07:26.423 --> 00:07:26.863]  Toxics.
[00:07:26.943 --> 00:07:27.323]  We're good to go.
[00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:27.623]  I think?
[00:07:56.852 --> 00:07:58.373]  We're good to go.
[00:07:58.453 --> 00:08:00.874]  We're good to go.
[00:08:25.223 --> 00:08:28.371]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:28.772 --> 00:08:31.879]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:32.814 --> 00:08:34.375]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:39.117]  We're now 8 minutes and 35 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:45.660]  We're going to have wide open phones today, and Phyllis Schlafly from the Eagle Forum joining us in the middle of the next hour.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:55.665]  Tomorrow, Congressman Tom Tancredo to talk about, well, our dissolving border, the free trade area, the Americas, and much, much more.
[00:08:55.705 --> 00:08:58.466]  We'll have the Colorado Congressman on tomorrow.
[00:08:59.781 --> 00:09:03.384]  And we are lining up some other interesting little guests today and tomorrow as well.
[00:09:03.864 --> 00:09:14.914]  Don't forget, this Saturday I'll be in Houston, Texas, at the Alamo Drafthouse Luxury Movie Theater at the West Oak Shopping Center from 6 p.m.
[00:09:14.934 --> 00:09:15.835]  to around midnight.
[00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:28.205]  I'm going to give a speech, show Road to Tyranny, have a question and answer, then show John Carpenter's incredible film, They Live, a great place to meet like-minded freedom lovers and patriots, constitutionalists, libertarians,
[00:09:28.505 --> 00:09:29.686]  Whatever you want to call us.
[00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:33.830]  And I'll also be there with my videos, books, and other items.
[00:09:34.091 --> 00:09:36.153]  They're on the table outside the movie theater.
[00:09:36.733 --> 00:09:42.359]  So again, that's this Saturday, about two days from now, in Houston, Texas, in H-Town.
[00:09:42.819 --> 00:09:48.645]  And details and tickets are available at InfoWars.com, or you can buy them there at the door.
[00:09:50.524 --> 00:09:52.705]  Oh, there is so much to cover today.
[00:09:53.665 --> 00:09:58.467]  In the first segment, that I know a lot of stations don't carry, I mentioned some of the news that's coming up.
[00:09:58.887 --> 00:10:01.688]  Let's just launch straight into it before I run out of time here.
[00:10:02.228 --> 00:10:07.289]  British intelligence helped paramilitaries bomb North Ireland.
[00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.831]  Now, we have an entire section on prisonplanet.com about MI5, MI6 terror.
[00:10:16.016 --> 00:10:28.332]  Where there are dozens and dozens and dozens BBC, AP, London Guardian, Sunday Herald, The Scotsman, Reuters.
[00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:37.017]  Where the government of England calmly admits and has been caught, okay, we blow up our own buildings and then there's no big discussion about it.
[00:10:37.417 --> 00:10:40.478]  It's buried in the back of British newspapers occasionally.
[00:10:41.018 --> 00:10:42.078]  There's no debating it.
[00:10:42.118 --> 00:10:43.298]  There's no discussing it.
[00:10:43.498 --> 00:10:54.161]  The British government blows things up and kills people and blames it on their enemies and uses it as a pretext to militarize and keep troops on the ground and to run checkpoints in Northern Ireland.
[00:10:54.401 --> 00:11:01.670]  What do you think's happening here in America with Homeland Security and NORTHCOM and General Eberhard and all the martial law comments?
[00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:03.833]  What do you think they're doing?
[00:11:04.173 --> 00:11:07.858]  It's a favorite British tactic, and that's who we're run by, basically.
[00:11:09.401 --> 00:11:11.522]  And here's another article today.
[00:11:11.562 --> 00:11:25.705]  The British government today faces tough questions about the controversial role of its intelligence services in Northern Ireland after an Irish report found grounds for suspecting that British security forces helped loyalist paramilitaries to bomb the Irish Republic.
[00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:35.708]  Four car bombs ripped through Dublin and other cities on May 17, 74, killing 33 people in the worst atrocity of the Irish Troubles.
[00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:38.029]  And again, they've caught them doing bombings as late as 1999.
[00:11:39.756 --> 00:11:55.465]  Last not independent report by the retired Supreme Court judge, Henry Barron, found it was neither fanciful nor absurd to suggest members of the security forces in Northern Ireland could have aided and abetted loyalist paramilitaries in bombing the Irish Republic.
[00:11:55.805 --> 00:11:57.106]  Well, go read the past articles.
[00:11:57.126 --> 00:11:58.646]  Go spend a few hours reading it.
[00:11:58.967 --> 00:12:00.147]  They've been caught.
[00:12:00.207 --> 00:12:00.868]  They've admitted it.
[00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:01.908]  It's come out in court.
[00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:06.251]  IRA, Orange, Protestants have admitted it.
[00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:08.412]  They are controlling both sides.
[00:12:08.952 --> 00:12:14.934]  But he said Britain's lack of cooperation in handing over documents was disappointing and had limited the scope of the report.
[00:12:15.314 --> 00:12:18.575]  Irish politicians were quick to criticize Britain's lack of transparency.
[00:12:19.055 --> 00:12:30.299]  Mr. Justice Barron said the material he assessed did not suggest senior members of the British intelligence were involved in the bombings.
[00:12:30.799 --> 00:12:34.901]  Folks, we have Margaret Thatcher ordering it when she got into office in the early 80s.
[00:12:36.007 --> 00:12:45.354]  But there was a possibility of involvement by individual members of the British Army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, or the local recruited militia, the Ulster Defense Regiment.
[00:12:45.635 --> 00:12:51.959]  Members of the RUC and the UDR were likely to have participated in or have been aware of plans for the attacks.
[00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:56.903]  The bombing operation was prepared on a farm owned by a RUC reserve officer.
[00:12:58.284 --> 00:13:03.048]  Again, this is a whitewash compared to past news, but it is a big government report out of Ireland.
[00:13:03.068 --> 00:13:04.109]  This is the London Guardian.
[00:13:05.376 --> 00:13:06.597]  Go read the past reports.
[00:13:06.677 --> 00:13:07.858]  They cooked the bombs.
[00:13:07.938 --> 00:13:08.879]  They trained the people.
[00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:12.802]  They carried them out to keep everybody at each other's throats.
[00:13:13.222 --> 00:13:16.885]  But new information on that for you.
[00:13:18.146 --> 00:13:23.971]  Speaking of government-sponsored terror, Al-Qaeda plans great event in the new year.
[00:13:23.991 --> 00:13:28.995]  Bin Laden reportedly to speak on tape broadcast by Al Jazeera.
[00:13:30.362 --> 00:13:31.863]  Remember earlier this year?
[00:13:31.883 --> 00:13:36.366]  Remember who got up on TV before Congress?
[00:13:37.187 --> 00:13:39.228]  Secretary of State Colin Powell.
[00:13:39.869 --> 00:13:45.192]  And he said that, oh, there's a tape airing on Al Jazeera right now where bin Laden says he's working with Saddam.
[00:13:45.212 --> 00:13:51.457]  I mean, right on time when they needed to have some evidence that's now been proven to be false, magically bin Laden shows up.
[00:13:51.537 --> 00:13:56.120]  But the media all ran out of the Congress meeting hall.
[00:13:57.051 --> 00:13:57.712]  We're good to go.
[00:14:15.475 --> 00:14:17.556]  Well, it'll be on in the next few hours.
[00:14:17.617 --> 00:14:18.977]  Got your timing a bit off.
[00:14:19.257 --> 00:14:29.463]  You know, normally the bombs go off when Tony Blair and Bush are meeting, talking about the threat of terror to Britain and how Britain better get behind giving up their liberties, and right as they're speaking, boom, boom, boom!
[00:14:29.963 --> 00:14:31.224]  Oh, everybody's dying!
[00:14:31.264 --> 00:14:32.865]  British embassies, British banks!
[00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:37.487]  And they say, boy, this really proves Bush and Blair's point.
[00:14:37.547 --> 00:14:39.188]  Man, wow!
[00:14:39.248 --> 00:14:40.909]  They really, man...
[00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:46.112]  But they got their timing off a little bit there.
[00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:52.255]  They've had the fat bin Laden videotape of bin Laden in a dark room with a nose twice the size of bin Laden's.
[00:14:52.655 --> 00:14:54.236]  A fat guy looked nothing like him.
[00:14:54.516 --> 00:14:55.517]  Like, I am bin Laden.
[00:14:55.597 --> 00:14:56.698]  I attack the buildings.
[00:14:56.878 --> 00:14:57.278]  Oh, yes.
[00:14:57.798 --> 00:14:58.699]  Oh, they wouldn't do that.
[00:14:58.739 --> 00:15:08.964]  They just put out fake nuclear reports out of Niger, fake aluminum tube reports, fake mass graves reports, fake weapons, mobile weapons trucks, bioweapons truck reports.
[00:15:09.724 --> 00:15:19.707]  False reports written 12 years ago, fake news articles planted in the media, hundreds of fake letters with fake signatures by troops in newspapers of how much they love the war.
[00:15:19.727 --> 00:15:22.148]  Oh, they wouldn't lie to you.
[00:15:23.448 --> 00:15:25.209]  They don't do that.
[00:15:27.674 --> 00:15:37.063]  Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, Al-Qaeda, is planning a great event that will shake the region to coincide with the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha.
[00:15:37.424 --> 00:15:50.917]  On February 2nd, according to London-based Arabic Daily, Al-Quds Al-Arabia reported an information coordinator for a group associated with Al-Qaeda, the Hasahib Institute, said a new...
[00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.545]  Video tape of Bin Laden will be circulated shortly before the holiday.
[00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:58.887]  Last time they did this, it was old videos edited, re-edited.
[00:16:00.868 --> 00:16:06.351]  And then after they have the big announcement, oh, it's a new Bin Laden tape, all the newspapers have a small little retraction.
[00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:08.172]  Okay, it was an old one, re-edited.
[00:16:08.852 --> 00:16:09.573]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:16:09.613 --> 00:16:14.555]  The general public is, you know, here's the big announcement and the small retraction's never heard.
[00:16:15.464 --> 00:16:32.413]  The coordinator, identified by the nickname Abiy Osama, or Osama's father, was asked in an interview with the Internet site Al-Anab, in which he is in possession of a pre-taped videotape of bin Laden, but said only when the event occurs it will be broadcast by Al Jazeera television.
[00:16:32.453 --> 00:16:33.974]  You mean CIA television.
[00:16:34.414 --> 00:16:42.619]  An agreement with Al Jazeera requires the network to broadcast any videotape the Sahib Institute provides about al-Qaeda, the coordinator said.
[00:16:43.638 --> 00:16:45.859]  And of course, nobody's arresting the Sahib group.
[00:16:46.619 --> 00:16:50.841]  And the CIA met with bin Laden before 9-11, and Bush Sr.
[00:16:50.881 --> 00:16:56.724]  met the day they flew the bin Ladens out on September 11th with bin Laden's older brother, on and on and on and on.
[00:16:57.564 --> 00:17:10.090]  But again, anytime you need to be scared back into submission, bin Laden will be brought out of the closet to get in your face like a buggy man, and you will submit to them properly.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.543]  This is out of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[00:17:13.644 --> 00:17:18.651]  Atlanta okays anti-terror cops, encourages public to report suspicious activity.
[00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:22.456]  This is all part of the Matrix system, federalizing local police.
[00:17:23.057 --> 00:17:24.740]  Yes, it's called the Matrix system, folks.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.564]  Atlanta Police Chief Richard Pennington.
[00:17:28.217 --> 00:17:28.757]  Oh, draw comparisons?
[00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:30.098]  We're in a police state, folks.
[00:17:30.138 --> 00:17:34.919]  The chief announced his homeland security unit on Wednesday to metro, state, and federal security and emergency management officials.
[00:17:52.285 --> 00:18:00.207]  The section will have about 23 investigators who investigate credible reports of individuals or organizations that might be assisting terrorists, the Pentagon said.
[00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:03.948]  By the way, you need to think about this.
[00:18:05.228 --> 00:18:16.131]  The definition of terrorism is anyone suspected of committing or planning to commit any misdemeanor as Section 802 of the Patriot Act states.
[00:18:16.151 --> 00:18:16.191]  H.R.
[00:18:16.211 --> 00:18:17.291]  3162, passed October 27, 2001.
[00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:37.468]  And, well, now they're raiding topless bars and pot dealers, and CPS is using terror cases, and they're going after people that sue public officials in Wisconsin and giving them five years in prison, and the state attorney says no one's allowed to sue us.
[00:18:37.488 --> 00:18:39.449]  That's an act of paper terrorism.
[00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.951]  That's in Police State 3, all the mainstream news articles on that.
[00:18:43.472 --> 00:18:45.253]  So just be aware of that.
[00:18:45.313 --> 00:18:46.473]  You're all terrorists.
[00:18:46.513 --> 00:18:47.514]  We're all terrorists.
[00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:48.510]  We're good to go.
[00:18:48.531 --> 00:18:48.711]  I think?
[00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:13.952]  The police chief said.
[00:19:14.032 --> 00:19:23.859]  But defining credible is what worries people like Ray Mickelson, who noted and unusually takes a court decision to define when police are behaving reasonably.
[00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:28.542]  Everybody agrees that a responsibility of government is to provide security for its citizens.
[00:19:28.962 --> 00:19:35.407]  Funny, the Supreme Court ruling says they're not to protect us, they're to respond to crime, but they lie to us to keep this illusion going.
[00:19:37.728 --> 00:19:38.609]  And that was Mike...
[00:19:40.214 --> 00:19:44.678]  Michael Thun, the spokesman for the Greater Atlanta Bill of Rights Defense Campaign, a small activist group.
[00:19:44.698 --> 00:19:50.163]  But we don't want to create an East German or Soviet Union where people are watching their neighbors and turning them in.
[00:19:50.324 --> 00:19:51.785]  Oh, no, we don't want to do that.
[00:19:51.805 --> 00:19:56.750]  There's only hundreds of programs that already do it for non-terror-related programs.
[00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.112]  We'll be right back with more news.
[00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:01.519]  We're good to go.
[00:20:25.547 --> 00:20:36.016]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:20:36.316 --> 00:20:36.817]  That's right.
[00:20:36.997 --> 00:20:44.123]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:20:44.403 --> 00:20:52.990]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:54.191]  888-803-4438.
[00:20:54.251 --> 00:20:55.172]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:55.392 --> 00:20:59.034]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[00:20:59.054 --> 00:21:01.296]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[00:21:03.057 --> 00:21:04.258]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[00:21:04.298 --> 00:21:07.360]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.040]  That's recovery?
[00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:25.599]  I love the sound of real money.

[00:23:53.213 --> 00:23:53.354]  P.O.
[00:23:53.394 --> 00:23:54.016]  Box 1227 Jacksonville, Oregon 97530.
[00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:10.260]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.121]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:24:13.181 --> 00:24:16.502]  Would you like to comment on any of the news I've already gone over?
[00:24:17.543 --> 00:24:18.983]  Or any news items we haven't covered?
[00:24:19.023 --> 00:24:21.664]  Do you have a question, a comment, you disagree with me on some issue?
[00:24:21.684 --> 00:24:21.744]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:21.764 --> 00:24:22.144]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:22.424 --> 00:24:25.145]  You see, I can defend my ideas, my understanding.
[00:24:34.682 --> 00:24:38.563]  They'll screen your calls out on Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity or Michael Savage.
[00:24:38.583 --> 00:24:47.165]  They want a bunch of mindless idiots worshipping world government, calling it conservative, worshipping communism, worshipping gun control, worshipping open borders.
[00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:48.906]  We don't do that here.
[00:24:48.926 --> 00:24:56.148]  We expose the criminality of the Republican Party as well as the Democratic Party and how they're nothing more than puppets.
[00:24:56.168 --> 00:24:56.848]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:56.868 --> 00:25:03.790]  Coming up, Governor Ridge says open borders and legalizing all illegals is good.
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:12.828]  And Bush is drawing a lot of heat from some that are actually still conservatives that haven't been brainwashed and reeducated by the neocon, Fox News, and others.
[00:25:13.188 --> 00:25:14.510]  The end culture is the world.
[00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:25.380]  And, well, what's happening now is people saw Bush cut Taiwan loose, and that's some cold bucket of water thrown on these people.
[00:25:26.187 --> 00:25:29.051]  Exploding the myth of church and state separation.
[00:25:29.652 --> 00:25:34.639]  And this is from WorldNetDaily, a six-page synopsis of some of this stuff.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.624]  I've seen the AP reports, you name it, that make up the article.
[00:25:38.596 --> 00:25:40.337]  And it says, in Texas, a U.S.
[00:25:40.357 --> 00:25:50.165]  District Judge decreed that any student uttering the word Jesus at his school graduation would be arrested and locked up and make no mistake, announced Judge Samuel B. Kent.
[00:25:50.425 --> 00:25:56.310]  The court is going to have the United States Marshal in attendance at the graduation of any student offends this court.
[00:25:57.491 --> 00:26:03.435]  That student will be summarily arrested and will face up to six months incarceration in the Galveston County Jail for contempt of court.
[00:26:05.457 --> 00:26:06.938]  There's dozens of these examples here.
[00:26:10.014 --> 00:26:13.336]  You read stuff like this on air, people can't believe it, but it was on Texas News.
[00:26:13.376 --> 00:26:17.618]  I've been hearing about it for weeks, since the judge said this two weeks ago.
[00:26:17.638 --> 00:26:26.924]  And, again, separation of church and state was in a letter from Thomas Jefferson, folks, to a religious group.
[00:26:27.284 --> 00:26:32.647]  What they didn't want was the government saying we're a Catholic nation, we're a Protestant nation, we're a Muslim nation.
[00:26:33.308 --> 00:26:38.871]  You don't have a national church, a Church of England or whatever.
[00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.291]  But we are a Christian nation.
[00:26:42.311 --> 00:26:43.992]  But the point is they can teach Harry Potter.
[00:26:44.032 --> 00:26:44.913]  You can pray to Buddha.
[00:26:45.493 --> 00:26:48.415]  They're teaching them, you know, trance meditation in most public schools.
[00:26:48.795 --> 00:26:52.437]  Now little children say, God is great, God is good, let us thank him for our food.
[00:26:52.818 --> 00:26:53.778]  And they're being arrested.
[00:26:53.838 --> 00:26:54.779]  CPS is coming.
[00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:56.480]  They're having Bibles confiscated.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.660]  Lawyers are being called in.
[00:26:58.861 --> 00:27:00.602]  This is mind control, folks.
[00:27:00.622 --> 00:27:01.663]  This is thought crime.
[00:27:03.204 --> 00:27:08.287]  In Missouri, when fourth grader Raymond Reyes bowed his head in prayer before his lunch at the cafeteria of
[00:27:08.999 --> 00:27:09.720]  We're good to go.
[00:27:27.863 --> 00:27:42.408]  In New York, kindergarten, Carla Broadus recited the familiar and beloved prayer, God is great, God is good, thank you, God, for my food, while holding hands with two students seated next to her at the snack table at her...
[00:27:43.068 --> 00:27:43.769]  We're good to go.
[00:28:13.186 --> 00:28:15.187]  But again, that's not what the First Amendment says.
[00:28:15.227 --> 00:28:22.753]  It says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:28:23.473 --> 00:28:28.196]  I mean, what do you think it is when Muslim girls wear the headscarves in school?
[00:28:28.396 --> 00:28:29.837]  Nobody has a problem with that!
[00:28:30.078 --> 00:28:31.098]  That's their religion!
[00:28:31.359 --> 00:28:32.499]  Right out in the open!
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:33.480]  You know what?
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.781]  I don't have a problem with it.
[00:28:35.001 --> 00:28:37.263]  This is America!
[00:28:37.503 --> 00:28:40.525]  This is the United States!
[00:28:41.525 --> 00:28:59.103]  But again, people in a major study of 339 colleges and universities, over two-thirds, over two-thirds, 70 plus percent, folks,
[00:29:01.558 --> 00:29:03.079]  71% don't know what it is.
[00:29:03.099 --> 00:29:05.501]  That's administrators and students at colleges.
[00:29:05.761 --> 00:29:12.627]  And then when asked, over 50% of administrators said they don't think the First Amendment is a good idea.
[00:29:12.947 --> 00:29:15.529]  That was the Washington Times two weeks ago.
[00:29:15.569 --> 00:29:19.192]  We had the folks that did the big study on last Friday.
[00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:26.417]  By the way, we need to post that to prisonplanet.com, that audio file, as soon as my webmaster gets over the flu.
[00:29:26.437 --> 00:29:27.038]  I know he will.
[00:29:27.785 --> 00:29:29.646]  He's been doing some updating today to fight his illness.
[00:29:30.006 --> 00:29:33.067]  Oh, he's crawling around with a laptop on the ground doing it literally.
[00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:34.448]  That's dedication.
[00:29:34.468 --> 00:29:35.608]  You don't have to do that, Paul.
[00:29:37.369 --> 00:29:38.249]  All right, folks.
[00:29:38.689 --> 00:29:39.570]  Hope you get better, buddy.
[00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.311]  My wife's updating InfoWars, so that's updated.
[00:29:43.051 --> 00:29:48.894]  We'll be back and get into more of this and cover a bunch of other news, so stay with us.
[00:29:51.395 --> 00:29:52.315]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.795 --> 00:29:54.296]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:31:01.255 --> 00:31:01.715]  We're good to go.

[00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:01.089]  You've heard of it.
[00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:02.050]  You've searched for it.
[00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.930]  We have it.
[00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.671]  I'm talking about Coral Calcium.

[00:33:01.204 --> 00:33:07.347]  We're moving forward in a collision course with the New World Order, and nothing on Earth can stop it.
[00:33:18.573 --> 00:33:19.334]  I think we're good to go.
[00:33:42.614 --> 00:33:49.578]  To stand up to the works of darkness, to stand up to tyranny, to educate the people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:49.618 --> 00:33:51.278]  That's our job.
[00:33:51.318 --> 00:34:00.023]  In America, 4% of the world's population was the wealthiest country on earth because we followed the guidelines.
[00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:06.066]  Now we've broken the rules, broken the accords, and as the Bible promises, we're losing our country.
[00:34:06.678 --> 00:34:07.738]  I think we're good to go.
[00:34:29.142 --> 00:34:38.491]  Would be arrested and locked up, and make no mistake, announce Judge Samuel B. Kent, who should move to the Soviet Union, quote, the court is going to have a United States Marshal in attendance.
[00:34:38.832 --> 00:34:47.560]  At the graduation, if any student offends this court, the student will be summarily arrested and will face a six-month incarceration in the Galveston County Jail for contempt of court.
[00:34:48.081 --> 00:34:50.944]  And I have dozens of examples of stuff even worse than this in front of me.
[00:34:51.678 --> 00:35:07.466]  The point here is that that's a violation of the First Amendment, which is free speech, freedom of the press, freedom to assemble, the petition of the government for redress of grievances, but it starts out with Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:35:08.147 --> 00:35:16.231]  And the Wiccans can have their little groups, the Harry Potter worshippers can, the Buddhists, the Muslims can wear their headdresses, that's all fine and dandy.
[00:35:16.835 --> 00:35:18.076]  We're good to go.
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:40.082]  It means you don't have an official government-sponsored sanction.
[00:35:40.102 --> 00:35:42.864]  You know, we're Catholic, we're Protestant, we're whatever.
[00:35:43.425 --> 00:35:44.885]  We're Hindus in America.
[00:35:45.386 --> 00:35:54.932]  No, it means the government shall make no law whatsoever concerning setting churches up, how they operate, taxation, regulation.
[00:35:55.272 --> 00:36:02.937]  But instead, they reversed that and said, no, it means total regulation, total control, and you can't pray at the lunch table by yourself.
[00:36:03.437 --> 00:36:07.638]  You can't say God is great, God is good, let us thank him for the food.
[00:36:08.279 --> 00:36:10.479]  You can't do any of that.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.181]  So now it's just don't have a prayer at the football game that nobody breaks their neck.
[00:36:16.241 --> 00:36:18.562]  Now it's can't have a prayer at the beginning of school.
[00:36:18.922 --> 00:36:32.066]  Now it's, oh, you in your own speech, in speech class, or in your acceptance, or they've gone after football coaches who say please bow your heads for a prayer of safety before the game.
[00:36:33.075 --> 00:36:35.216]  By the way, in 2000, the numbers came out.
[00:36:35.236 --> 00:36:37.897]  More people died playing football in high school than died from guns.
[00:36:37.957 --> 00:36:39.877]  But, again, let's not have a prayer.
[00:36:40.217 --> 00:36:41.278]  Let's just ban the guns.
[00:36:42.538 --> 00:36:43.699]  This is what we're talking about.
[00:36:43.759 --> 00:36:44.539]  This isn't freedom.
[00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:58.064]  But in a major study of 339 universities, I keep repeating this, universities and colleges, the administrators and the students, over two-thirds, over two-thirds, 70-plus percent, did not...
[00:36:59.905 --> 00:37:01.206]  No.
[00:37:01.966 --> 00:37:05.669]  Did not know what the First Amendment was.
[00:37:06.449 --> 00:37:10.332]  And so that's why they can tell you, the First Amendment says no freedom of speech.
[00:37:10.372 --> 00:37:12.273]  And we go, yes, sir!
[00:37:12.873 --> 00:37:14.414]  Yes, ma'am!
[00:37:14.834 --> 00:37:22.219]  Let me tell you, if I was a student at that school, I'd need to go to that graduation and just stand up and say, I love Jesus!
[00:37:22.699 --> 00:37:24.620]  And let them put me in jail for six months.
[00:37:25.301 --> 00:37:26.762]  We cannot put up with this!
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.301]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:37:50.054 --> 00:37:50.374]  We're good to go.
[00:37:50.394 --> 00:37:51.195]  We're good to go.
[00:38:10.327 --> 00:38:11.068]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:38:11.428 --> 00:38:13.169]  China says they thank Bush.
[00:38:13.189 --> 00:38:14.270]  They're appreciated.
[00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:19.013]  And Communist Chinese military is going to buy up a lot of our media.
[00:38:19.033 --> 00:38:19.813]  They've already done it.
[00:38:19.833 --> 00:38:20.994]  We'll get to that article.
[00:38:21.835 --> 00:38:22.815]  Out of China Daily.
[00:38:22.956 --> 00:38:25.537]  And Social Security checks could go south of the border.
[00:38:26.078 --> 00:38:29.160]  Arizona ranchers sued by civil rights groups for defending their own property.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.180]  Pentagon.
[00:38:30.801 --> 00:38:32.942]  Many of new Iraq soldiers are quitting.
[00:38:33.002 --> 00:38:34.203]  Associated Press.
[00:38:34.964 --> 00:38:36.725]  State finds more flu vaccine.
[00:38:36.765 --> 00:38:36.825]  And
[00:38:37.361 --> 00:38:40.304]  Tommy Thompson says they may have to round you up and put you in camp for your safety.
[00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:42.326]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:44.789]  Now, before I go to these calls, last little caveat here.
[00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:50.835]  I'm going to be in Houston, Texas this Saturday from 6 p.m.
[00:38:50.855 --> 00:38:51.856]  to around midnight.
[00:38:52.116 --> 00:38:53.517]  I'm going to give a 30-minute speech.
[00:38:54.178 --> 00:38:55.900]  I'm going to show 9-11 the road to tyranny.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.945]  I'm going to have a 15-, 20-minute question and answer, then about a 10-minute adjournment, recess.
[00:39:02.512 --> 00:39:03.733]  What do they call it, the movies?
[00:39:03.833 --> 00:39:04.433]  Intermission.
[00:39:04.854 --> 00:39:07.715]  Then we're going to show John Carpenter's They Live!
[00:39:07.735 --> 00:39:13.399]  And Alamo Drafthouse is a happening place in Austin and in Houston.
[00:39:13.499 --> 00:39:21.664]  Mel Gibson was here in town Sunday to show a surprise visit, to show the passion at the Alamo Drafthouse in downtown Austin, where I've shown Road to Charity twice.
[00:39:22.424 --> 00:39:28.008]  And last time we were in Houston, Mel Gibson's father and Mel Gibson's sister and Mel Gibson's cousins, a bunch of people showed up.
[00:39:28.028 --> 00:39:28.968]  I don't know if they're coming this time.
[00:39:28.988 --> 00:39:29.769]  I haven't even bugged them.
[00:39:30.445 --> 00:39:32.947]  I know they're busy, but they did show up last time.
[00:39:32.967 --> 00:39:33.928]  I probably won't this time.
[00:39:33.948 --> 00:39:38.551]  But the point is, you meet a lot of great folks at the events, and you never know who will be there.
[00:39:39.852 --> 00:39:42.795]  You never, never know, folks.
[00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:52.022]  And look, last time we didn't sell many tickets online right up until the day of the event, and they had capped the sale of tickets at 160 online.
[00:39:55.106 --> 00:39:55.546]  We're good to go.
[00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:29.133]  Or something else, and to slip in and see the speech or whatever.
[00:40:29.333 --> 00:40:30.434]  We had a standing room only.
[00:40:30.454 --> 00:40:35.458]  There were 350 in the seats, and I'd have to say about 75 standing around at the back.
[00:40:35.738 --> 00:40:37.560]  We ended up letting an overflow crowd get in.
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.182]  I don't want that to happen to you folks.
[00:40:40.362 --> 00:40:42.664]  I don't know if the second viewing is going to be as successful.
[00:40:43.004 --> 00:40:43.624]  Who knows?
[00:40:43.764 --> 00:40:45.586]  But just get your tickets now.
[00:40:46.907 --> 00:40:48.989]  It's at a big shopping mall, West Oak Shopping Mall.
[00:40:49.009 --> 00:40:54.093]  Get there an hour early, buy your tickets, go shopping or whatever, and then you can...
[00:40:55.552 --> 00:40:56.952]  Come in and see the film.
[00:40:56.992 --> 00:40:58.133]  West Oak Shopping Center.
[00:40:58.873 --> 00:41:00.993]  And it's in Houston, Texas.
[00:41:01.153 --> 00:41:07.055]  And there's a map and all that stuff at the Alamo Drafthouse website looking through at InfoWars.com.
[00:41:07.595 --> 00:41:12.096]  So please visit the site and go ahead and get your tickets.
[00:41:12.396 --> 00:41:16.698]  But I don't want folks to not come because they think they won't get tickets if you're not online.
[00:41:16.718 --> 00:41:17.598]  Just get there a little early.
[00:41:17.618 --> 00:41:18.458]  You shouldn't have a problem.
[00:41:19.373 --> 00:41:21.435]  So I will see you this Saturday in Houston, Texas.
[00:41:21.815 --> 00:41:23.597]  Also, I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[00:41:23.697 --> 00:41:24.798]  I've made ten films.
[00:41:25.178 --> 00:41:27.701]  The newest film, Matrix of Evil, is out.
[00:41:28.401 --> 00:41:30.003]  It is a little over two hours long.
[00:41:30.083 --> 00:41:39.251]  Congressman Ron Paul, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, Colonel Craig Roberts, Frank Morales, myself, riveting speeches, riveting interviews, video clips, documents.
[00:41:40.149 --> 00:41:44.432]  Full of solutions, full of the fight against the New World Order, an amazing new film.
[00:41:45.152 --> 00:42:03.784]  There's 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Seekers Inside Bohemian Grove, America Destroyed by Design, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, my book, Descent into Tyranny, Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order, Huffschmidt's new video, Painful Deceptions About 9-11.

[00:42:27.222 --> 00:42:29.765]  Some folks, we get the wrong address, and that causes a problem.

[00:43:08.596 --> 00:43:09.756]  Get the videos now.
[00:43:10.437 --> 00:43:15.700]  Okay, let's go to the calls, and then back into the news, and then Phyllis Schlafly in the middle of the next hour.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.381]  Wyatt in Maryland.
[00:43:18.441 --> 00:43:19.082]  You're on the air.
[00:43:19.102 --> 00:43:19.442]  Go ahead.
[00:43:20.137 --> 00:43:21.318]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:43:21.638 --> 00:43:22.299]  Good to talk to you.
[00:43:22.359 --> 00:43:23.340]  Good afternoon here, anyway.
[00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:26.843]  I hope you'll give me a few minutes.
[00:43:26.903 --> 00:43:28.605]  I'm waiting on the phone for 40 minutes.
[00:43:28.645 --> 00:43:33.229]  Let me start off by having a conversation with a young woman.
[00:43:34.371 --> 00:43:40.616]  I'm in car sales, and where our car sales dealership is located is halfway between Baltimore and Washington, D.C.
[00:43:41.357 --> 00:43:43.279]  So we get a lot of government people that come in and...
[00:43:45.083 --> 00:43:49.166]  So she came in and she's looking for a particular vehicle that won't be in.
[00:43:49.386 --> 00:43:52.108]  It's a brand new vehicle, won't be in until January.
[00:43:52.808 --> 00:43:54.889]  So as we're talking, I'm getting information from her.
[00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:57.111]  I asked her if she had a trade-in.
[00:43:57.131 --> 00:43:58.912]  She said, yeah, I got a 2002.
[00:43:59.432 --> 00:44:01.033]  It's got 40-some thousand miles on it.
[00:44:01.053 --> 00:44:02.254]  I said, wow, where do you drive?
[00:44:03.055 --> 00:44:05.296]  She said, well, back and forth to Eastern Shore, Maryland.
[00:44:06.237 --> 00:44:07.978]  And I said, wow, do you have family down there?
[00:44:07.998 --> 00:44:08.718]  And she said, yes.
[00:44:08.898 --> 00:44:12.621]  So, you know, making small talk to find out more information about her.
[00:44:13.331 --> 00:44:16.914]  So I said, where do you work?
[00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:18.596]  She said, well, I work for the Defense Department.
[00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:20.137]  So I said, oh, really?
[00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:27.744]  She said, well, I'm looking for this truck because my husband will be home in February, and that's when we're going to make a purchase.
[00:44:28.264 --> 00:44:29.445]  I said, where's your husband?
[00:44:29.505 --> 00:44:30.866]  She said, he's in Afghanistan.
[00:44:31.027 --> 00:44:32.788]  And I said, oh, wow, Afghanistan.
[00:44:32.808 --> 00:44:34.630]  I said, well, how long have you guys been married?
[00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:35.631]  She said, just two years.
[00:44:35.711 --> 00:44:37.192]  So I said, well, boy.
[00:44:37.754 --> 00:44:38.435]  I don't know what to say.
[00:44:55.471 --> 00:44:56.031]  Where do you work?
[00:44:56.251 --> 00:44:56.731]  In D.C.?
[00:44:56.751 --> 00:44:57.972]  She said, yeah, I work at the Pentagon.
[00:44:58.852 --> 00:45:01.812]  So I said to her, I said, well, are you from Eastern Shore?
[00:45:01.852 --> 00:45:03.733]  She said, no, I'm from Czechoslovakia.
[00:45:04.053 --> 00:45:05.613]  She had no accent whatsoever.
[00:45:05.893 --> 00:45:08.594]  I mean, there was no way to tell where she was from.
[00:45:09.074 --> 00:45:10.914]  She sounded just like she was your next-door neighbor.
[00:45:11.834 --> 00:45:13.894]  So I said, oh, wow, Czechoslovakia.
[00:45:13.955 --> 00:45:15.155]  I said, there's no accent at all.
[00:45:15.195 --> 00:45:15.715]  She said, I know.
[00:45:15.735 --> 00:45:17.375]  That's why I got hired at the Pentagon.
[00:45:18.195 --> 00:45:20.396]  So I said, well, where do you work?
[00:45:20.416 --> 00:45:21.936]  So we got into more talking than since then.
[00:45:22.335 --> 00:45:25.536]  Since I found out that her husband's in Afghanistan, I thought the door was open.
[00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:30.739]  So then I started to talk about you and shortwave and some statistics and some facts.
[00:45:31.559 --> 00:45:39.323]  And the facts were, I said to her, I said, you know, I said about five months ago, it was indicated that between 800 and 1,200 soldiers have been killed.
[00:45:39.883 --> 00:45:41.004]  And she shook her head yes.
[00:45:41.944 --> 00:45:42.764]  And I said, really?
[00:45:43.285 --> 00:45:44.045]  And she says, yeah.
[00:45:44.085 --> 00:45:45.966]  She says, I work at the Iraq desk.
[00:45:47.026 --> 00:45:50.568]  And she said, well, I'm compartmentalized, but I still have a lot of information.
[00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:54.962]  And she said, right now there's an average of 13 soldiers being killed every day.
[00:45:55.702 --> 00:45:56.222]  Every day.
[00:45:57.242 --> 00:46:07.004]  And it's not being reported, and it's being held for the American people, and that there is a fairly large percentage of those deaths are suicides.
[00:46:07.384 --> 00:46:09.284]  She said the suicide rate is outrageous.
[00:46:10.565 --> 00:46:13.685]  And so, I mean, I'm like, wow.
[00:46:13.805 --> 00:46:16.546]  So I said to her, you talked about the Pentagon.
[00:46:16.586 --> 00:46:17.746]  Look, hold on a second.
[00:46:17.766 --> 00:46:17.826]  Yes.
[00:46:18.914 --> 00:46:20.535]  Wyatt, I've let you talk for three minutes.
[00:46:21.255 --> 00:46:22.096]  Let me just throw this in.
[00:46:22.576 --> 00:46:23.897]  I know Wyatt.
[00:46:24.537 --> 00:46:31.681]  For those that have seen Police State 2000, Wyatt and several others went to Hebron, Maryland in 98.
[00:46:32.382 --> 00:46:33.242]  I've known Wyatt.
[00:46:33.262 --> 00:46:34.063]  He's been a listener since, I think, 97.
[00:46:35.479 --> 00:46:35.999]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:47:04.861 --> 00:47:09.482]  So then I said to her, I said, well, you know, how about the plane that hit the Pentagon?
[00:47:09.522 --> 00:47:16.783]  I said, didn't you find it kind of interesting that there was no plane debris, no tail section, no wheels, no seats, no nothing that was sheared off?
[00:47:16.823 --> 00:47:22.104]  And she said, she shook her head yes, and she said, that's something that we all talk about at the Pentagon.
[00:47:22.144 --> 00:47:23.424]  We don't know what happened.
[00:47:23.964 --> 00:47:25.925]  And I said, well, you know where it hit, didn't you?
[00:47:25.945 --> 00:47:32.306]  She said, yeah, it hit in the naval section that was under reconstruction, a renovation section.
[00:47:32.911 --> 00:47:37.093]  And there was very few people there, and she said that's why the death toll was so small.
[00:47:37.614 --> 00:47:46.058]  And she said many of us in the Pentagon have lots of questions about what's going on, and she said that if we talk about it, we will lose our jobs.
[00:47:46.779 --> 00:47:52.722]  And so that was enlightening for me and hopeful.
[00:47:53.162 --> 00:48:01.427]  But also she talked about the fact that she's deathly afraid of the Bush administration, and they're deathly afraid of John Ashcroft.
[00:48:02.348 --> 00:48:05.310]  And the actions that he's taken.
[00:48:06.531 --> 00:48:07.412]  Let me just add this.
[00:48:07.472 --> 00:48:15.017]  The Washington Times a year ago ran the headline, Morale Lowest in History at Pentagon, and it's because they're hearing about martial law.
[00:48:15.057 --> 00:48:17.659]  It's because they're learning about the foreign troops.
[00:48:17.699 --> 00:48:20.961]  It's because they're learning the reality, folks.
[00:48:21.241 --> 00:48:21.482]  Right.
[00:48:22.402 --> 00:48:23.243]  Well, then I... So I... I...
[00:48:27.168 --> 00:48:41.691]  Going on from there, she just said that, yeah, that's a conception that most people have, and there's a lot of, she said, there's nothing but total propaganda coming out of the administration and the Pentagon that are covering up so many lies.
[00:48:43.531 --> 00:48:44.791]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:48.432]  Concerning Iraq, they've never told the truth on anything.
[00:48:49.452 --> 00:48:54.273]  Everything they say when we check it out is a lie, folks, and they get caught lying and nothing happens.
[00:48:54.827 --> 00:48:56.987]  So I said to her, I said, why do you think we're there?
[00:48:57.027 --> 00:48:58.868]  She said, well, primarily it's the oil.
[00:48:59.568 --> 00:49:00.388]  That's why we're there.
[00:49:00.428 --> 00:49:01.988]  Well, that's not a sophisticated answer.
[00:49:02.028 --> 00:49:04.049]  It's about a military launch base.
[00:49:04.189 --> 00:49:05.589]  It's about a military launch base.
[00:49:05.769 --> 00:49:11.310]  It's also a money laundering black hole, and it's about setting the precedent for invading sovereign nations.
[00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:22.513]  Well, and a good part is I also gave her your website, prisonplant.com and infowars.com, and I told her to get the report on the PNAC.
[00:49:22.553 --> 00:49:22.933]  PNAC.
[00:49:25.118 --> 00:49:25.318]  Right.
[00:49:25.418 --> 00:49:26.259]  All right, got to let you go.
[00:49:26.379 --> 00:49:26.939]  Great points.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.080]  Great points, Wyatt.
[00:49:28.701 --> 00:49:31.142]  Let's talk to Wayne in Nebraska.
[00:49:31.182 --> 00:49:32.784]  You're on the air from Nebraska.
[00:49:32.804 --> 00:49:33.224]  Go ahead.
[00:49:33.504 --> 00:49:33.784]  Alex?
[00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:34.405]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:36.286]  Did you see CNN last night?
[00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:37.867]  No, I didn't.
[00:49:38.347 --> 00:49:46.333]  Okay, they had something about secret societies, and they were covering Bonesmen, and that's the skull and bones people.
[00:49:46.793 --> 00:49:53.458]  And they talked about our president and his daddy being a, well, they were at Yale and they were in it.
[00:49:54.285 --> 00:49:55.946]  I think that's who it was.
[00:49:56.327 --> 00:49:56.467]  Hmm.
[00:50:19.642 --> 00:50:21.523]  Well, I just didn't know if you saw that.
[00:50:21.864 --> 00:50:24.706]  No, I didn't see it, but I interviewed her about a year and a half ago.
[00:50:24.726 --> 00:50:26.207]  I mean, I've been into Bohemian Grove.
[00:50:26.627 --> 00:50:27.268]  I know that.
[00:50:27.308 --> 00:50:29.890]  David Bergen admits they run around neck in the woods.
[00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:34.153]  They bus in male and female prostitutes.
[00:50:34.213 --> 00:50:35.454]  That's Parade Magazine.
[00:50:36.275 --> 00:50:42.019]  Well, I just hope that all these judges and people can hear my voice.
[00:50:42.597 --> 00:50:44.898]  Because they're headed right straight to hell.
[00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:46.199]  Stay there, Wayne.
[00:50:46.219 --> 00:50:47.120]  You've been holding long enough.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.380]  I'll let you finish up.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:52.183]  We don't have a guest for 50 or 40 minutes, so we're going to have time to get to everybody's calls.
[00:50:52.243 --> 00:50:54.544]  Wayne and Rich and Alan and Marty and everybody else.
[00:50:54.944 --> 00:50:56.105]  We'll get to you real quick here.
[00:50:56.185 --> 00:50:59.527]  When we get back, stay with us to the other side.
[00:51:01.092 --> 00:51:05.434]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.614 --> 00:51:10.037]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.197 --> 00:51:14.559]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:51:14.599 --> 00:51:15.960]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.758 --> 00:51:21.960]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:28.962]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.082 --> 00:51:31.063]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.482 --> 00:51:41.807]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.087 --> 00:51:47.450]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:52:04.245 --> 00:52:07.745]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:52:07.845 --> 00:52:11.786]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:52:12.006 --> 00:52:18.167]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:18.567 --> 00:52:26.489]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:52:26.889 --> 00:52:32.252]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.

[00:52:57.804 --> 00:52:58.625]  Protect your family.
[00:52:58.645 --> 00:53:01.827]  Hey everybody, let me talk to you about your weight for a minute.
[00:53:01.887 --> 00:53:04.469]  How many of you have tried the fad diets?
[00:53:04.669 --> 00:53:05.810]  You've tried the pills.
[00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:07.271]  You've tried counting calories.
[00:53:07.491 --> 00:53:09.973]  You've even tried other nighttime weight loss formulas.
[00:53:10.325 --> 00:53:11.726]  And nothing seems to be working.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.861]  No ephedra, no stimulants.
[00:53:29.921 --> 00:53:35.762]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:53:35.822 --> 00:53:37.103]  This is the real deal, folks.
[00:53:37.163 --> 00:53:39.764]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[00:53:39.884 --> 00:53:40.904]  And it's healthy for you, too.

[00:53:51.207 --> 00:53:51.407]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:54:07.739 --> 00:54:10.943]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:54:12.044 --> 00:54:12.785]  We're here, folks.
[00:54:13.105 --> 00:54:14.126]  We broadcast 1 a.m.
[00:54:14.246 --> 00:54:14.587]  to 4 a.m.
[00:54:14.627 --> 00:54:15.888]  as well, nine hours a day.
[00:54:15.948 --> 00:54:18.952]  No excuse to miss it, no matter what schedule you're on.
[00:54:20.235 --> 00:54:25.520]  I know a lot of folks over in Australia listen to the late night show, the early morning show, because that's the daytime for them.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:32.465]  Let's go ahead and go back to Wayne in Nebraska, then Rick, Alan, Marty, Leon, and others.
[00:54:33.306 --> 00:54:39.431]  Wayne, finish up your point about the satanic organizations our Christian conservative leaders are part of.
[00:54:39.991 --> 00:54:40.672]  Yes, they are.
[00:54:42.433 --> 00:54:43.534]  It's amazing to me.
[00:54:43.994 --> 00:54:45.676]  These people are going straight to hell.
[00:54:46.637 --> 00:54:48.258]  They're the first ones going to get judged.
[00:54:48.318 --> 00:54:50.239]  The judges, the politicians, all of them.
[00:54:50.579 --> 00:54:51.760]  I hope they can hear my voice.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.040]  I hope they repel other ways.
[00:54:54.361 --> 00:55:00.344]  I guess tonight they're also going to cover the Masonic people on CNN.
[00:55:00.644 --> 00:55:03.826]  And they're having to respond to all this to counter us.
[00:55:04.226 --> 00:55:04.887]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:55:04.927 --> 00:55:06.707]  You're making the difference.
[00:55:07.368 --> 00:55:08.408]  You were on KOA.
[00:55:08.468 --> 00:55:11.530]  A friend of mine heard you on KOA, and he was stunned.
[00:55:11.929 --> 00:55:14.990]  He said he didn't believe all this stuff that was coming.
[00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:16.331]  He was just stunned by it.
[00:55:16.451 --> 00:55:18.512]  He believed it, but he was just stunned by it.
[00:55:19.092 --> 00:55:32.138]  Well, you know, I've quietly, in over 1,300 radio interviews in the last two-plus years, hurt the globalists badly, but I'm only one person in this fight, though I am a lieutenant in the Army of Liberty and Freedom.
[00:55:32.278 --> 00:55:37.580]  Well, you're like Samson, you know, the one who killed all them people with a sword.
[00:55:38.541 --> 00:55:39.201]  Was it Samson?
[00:55:39.561 --> 00:55:40.181]  Well, it was a...
[00:55:42.091 --> 00:55:43.732]  It was a donkey job.
[00:55:44.292 --> 00:55:44.552]  Yeah.
[00:55:45.913 --> 00:55:46.793]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:55:46.933 --> 00:55:47.374]  That's right.
[00:55:47.754 --> 00:55:52.216]  But, you know, basically, you're the one making the difference in this whole thing.
[00:55:52.256 --> 00:56:00.300]  No, if it wasn't for you, the listener, spreading the word, calling into other shows, making copies of the videos.
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.221]  Look, I'm just one person in this fight.
[00:56:02.816 --> 00:56:08.818]  Well, and one person, well, I always, you know, you talk about the Bible, but you know who the majority is?
[00:56:09.258 --> 00:56:09.878]  Us and the Lord.
[00:56:10.078 --> 00:56:11.918]  That's what I want to leave with the listeners.
[00:56:12.418 --> 00:56:17.060]  And the rest of them, if they don't think we got the victory, well, they didn't read the end of the book.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:17.820]  That's it.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.300]  I appreciate the call, Wayne.
[00:56:20.281 --> 00:56:22.641]  Rick in, I believe, Colorado.
[00:56:22.761 --> 00:56:23.421]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:56:23.661 --> 00:56:25.402]  Yeah, hey, Alex, a long-time listener.
[00:56:25.742 --> 00:56:26.502]  Good to hear from you.
[00:56:26.902 --> 00:56:29.123]  Yeah, we pass out your videos all the time.
[00:56:29.163 --> 00:56:29.823]  We got all of them.
[00:56:30.963 --> 00:56:32.984]  I had two questions kind of off-topic.
[00:56:34.384 --> 00:56:38.405]  You're familiar with the police going into that school and throwing all the kids down?
[00:56:38.745 --> 00:56:40.486]  Yeah, we had their lawyer on.
[00:56:40.846 --> 00:56:48.668]  Now the video's out, and Drudge had it on his website yesterday, of the dog grabbing the backpack and shaking it with the children.
[00:56:49.388 --> 00:56:49.948]  Right, right.
[00:56:50.068 --> 00:56:52.369]  A German shepherd trained an attack dog and stuff.
[00:56:52.389 --> 00:56:54.909]  Did you see the video stills from that?
[00:56:55.289 --> 00:56:55.749]  Yes, I did.
[00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:56.490]  That's what I saw.
[00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.590]  Did you see the...
[00:56:58.568 --> 00:57:06.215]  I haven't heard anything about this, but there's a soldier in full uniform in the lower left-hand corner helping the police officer with the buzz cut.
[00:57:07.015 --> 00:57:11.119]  I know that in schools all over the country they do have regular Army and National Guard in the schools.
[00:57:11.299 --> 00:57:14.662]  I saw that camo, but they won't tell us that that was military.
[00:57:14.922 --> 00:57:19.025]  Yeah, well, the guy that I saw had the full bread basket over the left chest.
[00:57:19.105 --> 00:57:23.589]  I mean, this guy was in full dress uniform, like he was directing something.
[00:57:24.611 --> 00:57:26.392]  Send me that still that you found.
[00:57:26.532 --> 00:57:27.192]  I will do that.
[00:57:27.752 --> 00:57:30.754]  Send that to tips at infowars.com.
[00:57:30.774 --> 00:57:31.794]  You'll see it up there tomorrow.
[00:57:31.914 --> 00:57:32.654]  Okay, you got it.
[00:57:32.694 --> 00:57:34.815]  Yeah, and no one's raised that question.
[00:57:34.855 --> 00:57:35.695]  I thought that was kind of odd.
[00:57:35.716 --> 00:57:37.976]  Well, see, that's why, again, it's not about Alex Jones.
[00:57:38.016 --> 00:57:38.617]  It's all of us.
[00:57:38.657 --> 00:57:43.699]  We have millions of eyes, millions of ears, millions of brains, all watching everything.
[00:57:43.819 --> 00:57:44.839]  Okay, okay.
[00:57:44.879 --> 00:57:51.902]  The other thing I had was I was reading a story on, and this is way off topic, the Kennedy assassination.
[00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:53.370]  It's all on topic.
[00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:54.331]  Yeah, the government killed him.
[00:57:54.531 --> 00:58:00.213]  Yeah, but there was a story that the Dallas Police Department diverted his route at the last minute.
[00:58:00.473 --> 00:58:01.733]  Yes.
[00:58:01.793 --> 00:58:02.974]  But I hadn't really heard anything.
[00:58:02.994 --> 00:58:07.175]  And they pulled his regular Secret Service off of him and did all of that.
[00:58:07.576 --> 00:58:07.796]  Right.
[00:58:07.956 --> 00:58:08.236]  Oh, okay.
[00:58:08.256 --> 00:58:09.816]  I was wondering if you knew anything about that.
[00:58:09.836 --> 00:58:13.978]  I mean, we have the mistress at the meeting where they planned to kill him, the final meeting the night before.
[00:58:14.218 --> 00:58:15.799]  We've had his personal lawyer on.
[00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:17.159]  Everybody's going public.
[00:58:17.459 --> 00:58:17.839]  Okay, okay.
[00:58:17.879 --> 00:58:18.740]  I thought I heard that.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:19.660]  And by the way, now...
[00:58:21.241 --> 00:58:25.962]  92% of America in major polls believes the CIA killed Kennedy with the FBI.
[00:58:26.383 --> 00:58:27.203]  Last year it was 82%.
[00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:28.964]  Right, right.
[00:58:29.564 --> 00:58:32.545]  Well, you know, we've had a lot of luck with your videos.
[00:58:32.725 --> 00:58:37.467]  We pass out, I guess, basically the best ones are 9-11 Road to Tyranny and Police State 3.
[00:58:38.607 --> 00:58:42.229]  And we're waking up a lot of Denver Fire Department and Police Department.
[00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:44.010]  We get a lot of requests from them.
[00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:45.250]  I tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:46.631]  I want to hear more about this.
[00:58:47.211 --> 00:58:48.832]  We'll come right back to you, sir.
[00:58:48.852 --> 00:58:49.652]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:58:51.733 --> 00:59:02.460]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:10.225]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:10.465 --> 00:59:13.608]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable level.
[00:59:13.889 --> 00:59:19.715]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:59:19.915 --> 00:59:26.061]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:59:26.434 --> 00:59:30.318]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:59:30.378 --> 00:59:32.279]  The water level is always visible.
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:38.385]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:59:38.625 --> 00:59:42.889]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:42.909 --> 00:59:43.370]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:59:57.987 --> 00:59:58.607]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.288 --> 01:00:00.328]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.048 --> 01:00:02.149]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:03.629]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.389 --> 01:00:06.310]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:09.611]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.132 --> 01:00:14.253]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.473 --> 01:00:18.515]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[01:00:19.435 --> 01:00:20.476]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[01:00:20.596 --> 01:00:21.316]  We're here live.
[01:00:21.336 --> 01:00:24.177]  We have the president and founder of the Eagle Forum, Phyllis Shravely.
[01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:32.107]  Joining us here in about 30 minutes, we're going to keep taking calls, get into Governor Ridge saying he wants open borders and total legalization of illegals.
[01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:36.674]  Real conservatives are reeling from Bush cutting Taiwan loose.
[01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.690]  There's a bunch of other key Iraq news.
[01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:41.411]  It's all coming up in the shower.
[01:00:41.792 --> 01:00:43.353]  Right now, we're going right back to the calls.
[01:00:43.393 --> 01:00:46.254]  Let's talk to Rick in Colorado.
[01:00:46.294 --> 01:00:57.121]  He was just telling me and you during the last segment that with Police State 3 total enslavement, with 9-11 or no deterrent, with those two videos, he's waking up a lot of firemen and police.
[01:00:57.501 --> 01:01:01.664]  When we hit the break, I want to hear what response he's getting.
[01:01:02.304 --> 01:01:03.705]  Go ahead, sir, and finish up.
[01:01:04.866 --> 01:01:05.987]  Basically, what we're getting...
[01:01:07.213 --> 01:01:09.275]  Is a lot of give and take.
[01:01:09.355 --> 01:01:12.297]  They're giving us some information, which we're going to be sending you.
[01:01:12.917 --> 01:01:17.400]  It's on all their Homeland Security training that they're going to be doing.
[01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:20.963]  And most of these guys are kind of worried now.
[01:01:21.984 --> 01:01:24.766]  What do they say after seeing the films?
[01:01:24.946 --> 01:01:25.926]  Describe it for me.
[01:01:26.307 --> 01:01:33.672]  Well, kind of the response that we got was that they knew some of this stuff, but they never saw it put into context before.
[01:01:34.629 --> 01:01:38.253]  For total understanding, the way that you did it in the movies.
[01:01:38.813 --> 01:01:47.163]  Basically, they all brought a number of tapes and said, hey, since you're passing them out, make some and we want to give some to other people.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:58.390]  And I've heard this story 500 times on air, where people like you get the videos, make copies, give them to police, military, firefighters, government officials, and then they come back and say, can I have more copies?
[01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:59.071]  Oh, exactly.
[01:01:59.091 --> 01:02:00.252]  That's exactly what we're doing.
[01:02:06.978 --> 01:02:09.880]  All the dots are there, and I go, okay, connect them how you wish.
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.982]  There's only one way to connect them.
[01:02:12.002 --> 01:02:13.543]  They say to us, say it ain't so.
[01:02:13.583 --> 01:02:15.064]  We go, yeah, it is so.
[01:02:15.304 --> 01:02:17.666]  So what are they saying about this when you bring it forward to them?
[01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:20.848]  Well, half the stuff they don't even know.
[01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.912]  A lot of them are flabbergasted, is the thing.
[01:02:24.252 --> 01:02:27.234]  And then a lot of it they do, and they know it's accurate, so then they go, wow.
[01:02:27.354 --> 01:02:27.974]  Exactly.
[01:02:28.014 --> 01:02:33.196]  Also, we give them your website, and I tell them flat out, I said, don't believe anything that you see.
[01:02:33.457 --> 01:02:34.217]  Look it up yourself.
[01:02:34.537 --> 01:02:37.479]  And the guys that do are just really flabbergasted.
[01:02:37.999 --> 01:02:39.440]  What are they saying they're going to do now?
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.241]  They're all preparing, believe it or not.
[01:02:43.161 --> 01:02:47.003]  I mean, these guys, they're preparing for the worst, and they're passing the word.
[01:02:47.744 --> 01:02:50.585]  So there's an awful lot of them that say, well, they're not going to participate.
[01:02:51.494 --> 01:02:55.495]  Well, I would advise them not to, and I'd advise all of us not to participate.
[01:02:55.595 --> 01:02:56.655]  Don't try to engage.
[01:02:56.695 --> 01:02:57.655]  Don't try to get in fights.
[01:02:57.995 --> 01:02:59.316]  Stay away from the trouble.
[01:02:59.696 --> 01:03:05.917]  The globalists are counting on releasing something, creating hysteria, having everything break down, and bringing the military in.
[01:03:06.357 --> 01:03:08.438]  And I'm sorry, the military's waking up too.
[01:03:08.798 --> 01:03:15.599]  Your tapes, actually, when we started passing them out, stopped the majority of these guys from getting the vaccines too.
[01:03:16.506 --> 01:03:23.050]  That was one of the things they were being told they needed to take these vaccines, and we know a lot of the first responders, and they flat out refused.
[01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:26.933]  None of them got fired because they've got pretty secure jobs.
[01:03:27.073 --> 01:03:28.273]  Well, it's all color of law.
[01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:36.658]  We had firefighters, police chiefs, fire chiefs on a year and a half ago when they were trying to really start the push, which they finally suspended, what, two months ago?
[01:03:36.778 --> 01:03:36.939]  Right.
[01:03:37.099 --> 01:03:39.320]  And they tell them, well, you can't get insurance.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.262]  Well, we're going to have to let you go upon review if you don't do it.
[01:03:42.302 --> 01:03:42.462]  Right.
[01:03:43.283 --> 01:03:45.565]  And when the majority said no, they had to back off.
[01:03:45.605 --> 01:03:47.106]  See, that's how this works.
[01:03:47.186 --> 01:03:50.049]  We can stop the globalists from releasing smallpox.
[01:03:50.249 --> 01:04:00.960]  We can stop the globalists from blowing more stuff up if we are man enough and woman enough to admit the facts, go public, and say no, the globalists will back off.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:01.680]  Right, right.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.904]  Now, we do get the odd one or two people that...
[01:04:05.819 --> 01:04:08.200]  Basically say they don't want to be woke up.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.721]  They know this stuff is true.
[01:04:10.821 --> 01:04:13.862]  If they're a leftist, they'll say I'm a fascist racist.
[01:04:13.922 --> 01:04:16.863]  If they're a phony right-winger, they'll call me a communist.
[01:04:16.963 --> 01:04:18.204]  Right, right, right.
[01:04:18.564 --> 01:04:27.467]  We've given tapes to some people that still have refused to watch them because they know it's real, but they don't want to come out of that sleepy world, I guess you'd call it.
[01:04:27.507 --> 01:04:29.728]  What percentage of them would you say are like that?
[01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.929]  Less than 1%.
[01:04:32.503 --> 01:04:32.984]  Less than 1%.
[01:04:33.344 --> 01:04:39.889]  We get literally 99.9% response that they love them.
[01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.190]  Folks, think of the power.
[01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:44.212]  We have a chance to save America.
[01:04:44.712 --> 01:04:45.593]  We can really do it.
[01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:46.393]  It's up to you.
[01:04:46.754 --> 01:04:48.055]  Make more copies.
[01:04:48.155 --> 01:04:49.196]  Thank you for what you're doing.
[01:04:49.436 --> 01:04:51.017]  We'll be right back with more Callsmore News.
[01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:57.753]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:57.933 --> 01:05:02.356]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:02.516 --> 01:05:06.879]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:05:06.919 --> 01:05:08.260]  The New World Order.
[01:05:10.061 --> 01:05:14.286]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:14.346 --> 01:05:21.295]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:21.415 --> 01:05:23.398]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.806 --> 01:05:34.130]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:39.773]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:05:40.293 --> 01:05:42.914]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:05:42.934 --> 01:05:43.794]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:43.814 --> 01:05:44.355]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:45.355]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:56.866]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:57.527]  Yes.
[01:05:57.807 --> 01:06:02.609]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[01:06:02.729 --> 01:06:11.672]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[01:06:11.812 --> 01:06:19.515]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[01:06:19.735 --> 01:06:21.976]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[01:06:22.156 --> 01:06:24.037]  Go to AustinWheatgrass.com or call toll-free 1-877-MY-WHEAT.
[01:06:24.057 --> 01:06:26.258]  And thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[01:06:52.443 --> 01:06:55.704]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:06:55.764 --> 01:06:59.945]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:07:00.185 --> 01:07:02.986]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:07:03.166 --> 01:07:05.586]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:07:05.766 --> 01:07:14.429]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:07:14.609 --> 01:07:15.949]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:07:16.149 --> 01:07:20.350]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:07:20.632 --> 01:07:22.354]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:07:22.614 --> 01:07:34.545]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:07:34.745 --> 01:07:41.231]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:07:41.511 --> 01:07:48.098]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.142]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:07:54.185 --> 01:07:56.388]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:59.751]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:04.211 --> 01:08:16.202]  Time and time again, if we can just get police, military, firefighters, doctors, medical workers, people who are inside the system to watch 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3, Matrix of Evil.
[01:08:16.222 --> 01:08:25.991]  I mean, I get the feedback here every couple days on the show, people all over the country, where 90-plus percent of the people that see the films are waking up.
[01:08:26.031 --> 01:08:30.155]  And you just heard that from Rick in Colorado with the firefighters and the police.
[01:08:32.259 --> 01:08:33.500]  And this isn't hype, folks.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.161]  If we move against the globalists, they can't stand.
[01:08:36.501 --> 01:08:39.523]  The question is, can we get you to move against them?
[01:08:39.923 --> 01:08:43.685]  Can we get you to make copies of the films, to put them on AXS TV, to get them out to folks?
[01:08:45.026 --> 01:08:49.908]  And the answer is, yes, folks, you should move against the globalists, or they're going to carry out more terror.
[01:08:50.629 --> 01:08:57.212]  And we are in such an incredible place in history, fighting against this dehumanization, actually having an effect.
[01:08:58.027 --> 01:08:58.508]  We're good to go.
[01:09:10.276 --> 01:09:15.057]  We're about to go to Alan and Marty and Leon and JQ and John quickly.
[01:09:15.077 --> 01:09:24.659]  Over the next four or five minutes, I'm honored to have our great sponsor on, and that's Debbie Morrow with New Millennium Concepts with the holiday Christmas specials.
[01:09:24.879 --> 01:09:26.380]  I'm committing a thought crime saying Christmas.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:27.780]  I may offend somebody.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:35.342]  Great water filters at wonderful prices, and you support the international outreach of this show.
[01:09:36.202 --> 01:09:39.144]  And Jim announced a special yesterday.
[01:09:39.164 --> 01:09:39.885]  What was it?
[01:09:39.905 --> 01:09:41.245]  $149 for $199.
[01:09:41.446 --> 01:09:48.170]  Two super sterazole filters in a Berkey light setup.
[01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:50.291]  This will do, he said, 30 gallons a day.
[01:09:50.331 --> 01:09:52.693]  It cuts out just everything, folks.
[01:09:53.193 --> 01:09:56.976]  It is amazing, amazing, amazing system.
[01:09:57.136 --> 01:09:58.757]  And for $149, you just can't beat it.
[01:09:58.797 --> 01:10:02.099]  To try to buy one of these in a sporting goods store, $300, $250 if you're lucky.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.743]  And Debbie, thanks for coming on the show to tell folks about it.
[01:10:08.284 --> 01:10:09.124]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:10:09.264 --> 01:10:10.365]  Thanks for having me.
[01:10:10.846 --> 01:10:28.500]  Not only are we offering that December special for the $149 for the Berkey light with the ceramic filters, but we're also making available the October special that we had back in October because we had such a really wonderful response to it.
[01:10:29.061 --> 01:10:31.603]  We wanted to go ahead and make it available again.
[01:10:33.005 --> 01:10:34.446]  It was a really big package.
[01:10:34.566 --> 01:10:39.247]  It comes with the Berkey light with the lights, either white or blue in color.
[01:10:39.828 --> 01:10:50.491]  You can have the Berkey solar attachment, a KDF shower filter, which a lot of people ask me about the shower filters, and they are fantastic.
[01:10:50.551 --> 01:10:52.192]  They really make a difference.
[01:10:52.232 --> 01:10:53.953]  That's where you absorb a lot of the garbage.
[01:10:54.173 --> 01:10:54.433]  Yes.
[01:10:54.733 --> 01:10:55.373]  Yes, you do.
[01:10:55.433 --> 01:10:57.454]  And the shower filters, you know,
[01:10:58.371 --> 01:10:59.472]  Never get complaints.
[01:11:00.133 --> 01:11:02.435]  People just love them and reorder them every year.
[01:11:02.455 --> 01:11:08.821]  We do replace them either once a year or every 10,000 gallons, whichever comes first.
[01:11:09.502 --> 01:11:13.506]  So those are available in this package or they can be bought individually.
[01:11:13.526 --> 01:11:22.695]  And then you have the battery adapter and you get a choice of either two Berkey Sport bottles or two bottles of Test, Midate or one of each.
[01:11:23.266 --> 01:11:28.598]  Which the total price on that package is $471, but for the special price we've got it knocked down to $383, which is an $88 savings.
[01:11:34.798 --> 01:11:45.084]  Now, again, that comes with the four black elements, the Berkey light with the solar panel charger to charge up the LEDs that will run for two weeks after you charge, rechargeable batteries.
[01:11:45.405 --> 01:11:50.988]  It comes with an adapter to plug into that system so you can run your cell phone or radio off the unit.
[01:11:51.028 --> 01:12:00.554]  It's kind of like a survival buoy, and you get some sports bottles, little mobile water filters that can come out of streams or lakes and cut out all the pathogenic bacteria.
[01:12:00.834 --> 01:12:01.714]  Right, that's exactly right.
[01:12:01.774 --> 01:12:05.995]  Was it the holiday special on the generic sport bottles and the regular sport bottles?
[01:12:06.015 --> 01:12:06.956]  I've had such good response to that.
[01:12:06.976 --> 01:12:07.756]  They make great gifts.
[01:12:20.854 --> 01:12:21.134]  I think so.
[01:12:50.431 --> 01:12:56.154]  And folks, there's cryptosporidium in the water.
[01:12:56.194 --> 01:12:58.255]  They don't even clean that out at the sewage treatment plants.
[01:12:58.515 --> 01:12:59.896]  They just hope there's no sewage.
[01:13:00.216 --> 01:13:03.297]  There's Ritalin, Prozac, hormones from the birth control.
[01:13:03.377 --> 01:13:04.558]  It's in most of the fish now.
[01:13:04.618 --> 01:13:05.258]  It's in people.
[01:13:05.539 --> 01:13:07.379]  It's in almost all streams they test.
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.781]  The MBTE in 49 states.
[01:13:10.841 --> 01:13:11.882]  Horrible carcinogen.
[01:13:12.142 --> 01:13:16.304]  Bush just gave them blanket liability protection on that to dump even more of it in the water.
[01:13:17.725 --> 01:13:20.346]  Folks, there's a reason the sperm counts down by 75%.
[01:13:20.667 --> 01:13:23.408]  There's a reason cancer's up by 400%.
[01:13:24.689 --> 01:13:26.751]  You've got to stop drinking the trash.
[01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:28.492]  There's enough of it in your food and the air.
[01:13:28.972 --> 01:13:30.933]  Cut out most of it through the water.
[01:13:31.354 --> 01:13:32.374]  This is the way to do it.
[01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:34.816]  Give Debbie a call right now, folks.
[01:13:35.136 --> 01:13:37.698]  And even if you already have a Berkey, give it as a gift to family.
[01:13:37.978 --> 01:13:38.599]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:13:42.784 --> 01:13:47.169]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:53.016]  And again, if you call and it's busy or just leave your name and number, Debbie will call you right back today.
[01:13:53.036 --> 01:13:53.576]  888-803-4438.
[01:13:53.656 --> 01:13:57.201]  And Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[01:13:57.241 --> 01:13:57.461]  Thank you.
[01:13:58.422 --> 01:14:01.224]  I appreciate it.
[01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:03.365]  You bet.
[01:14:03.385 --> 01:14:03.605]  888-803-4438.
[01:14:04.005 --> 01:14:10.289]  Alright, we don't have any snake oil or magic rocks or crystals for you or anything like that.
[01:14:11.649 --> 01:14:18.473]  We've just got high quality water filters at great prices and documentary films that wake people up and books and stuff.
[01:14:18.493 --> 01:14:24.957]  We're about reality here and credibility on this show and you can't go wrong with the line of quality stuff they've got for you.
[01:14:25.257 --> 01:14:26.277]  Okay, let's go to the calls.
[01:14:26.317 --> 01:14:26.998]  Thanks for holding.
[01:14:27.578 --> 01:14:30.580]  Let us now talk to Alan in Ohio.
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.580]  Alan, you're on the air.
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:32.080]  Go ahead.
[01:14:33.681 --> 01:14:34.342]  Go ahead, Alan.
[01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:40.145]  Okay, Alan is gone then.
[01:14:40.245 --> 01:14:41.225]  Alan was up next.
[01:14:42.005 --> 01:14:43.446]  We'll talk to Marty in Texas.
[01:14:43.506 --> 01:14:44.407]  Marty, you're on the air.
[01:14:44.427 --> 01:14:46.288]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:14:46.408 --> 01:14:46.868]  Fine, sir.
[01:14:47.528 --> 01:14:48.509]  I'm calling from Texas.
[01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:49.349]  First time caller.
[01:14:49.569 --> 01:14:50.190]  Good to talk to you.
[01:14:51.405 --> 01:14:53.867]  I'll make this short so that people can get in.
[01:14:54.247 --> 01:15:10.921]  I wanted to make a comment about something I heard recently about illegals getting Social Security, being able to go back to Mexico, and even if they haven't put in their time here, their years of work in Mexico will be added.
[01:15:11.872 --> 01:15:14.254]  Do they have time for social security?
[01:15:14.294 --> 01:15:14.514]  Yes.
[01:15:14.674 --> 01:15:21.740]  Look, the European Union, to answer your question, started almost 50 years ago as a steel deal on tariffs.
[01:15:22.361 --> 01:15:24.142]  Then they merged the border police.
[01:15:24.182 --> 01:15:26.785]  Then they merged their pensions, their social security.
[01:15:27.045 --> 01:15:28.346]  Then they merged their courts.
[01:15:28.606 --> 01:15:31.609]  And then they announced, oh, it's a global government.
[01:15:31.649 --> 01:15:37.313]  You don't have any rights and you can't vote anymore for who is going to be on the 10-member board, now 15-member board.
[01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:38.715]  It ought to be 25-member board.
[01:15:38.735 --> 01:15:40.096]  They're about to add 15 more countries.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:42.220]  And I have an article.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.601]  Let me dig it out here today.
[01:15:44.621 --> 01:15:46.741]  I've been covering this for six months since they first announced it.
[01:15:47.021 --> 01:15:53.722]  But the free trade area of the Americas is the trade side of the Pan-American Union.
[01:15:54.563 --> 01:16:02.964]  And one taxation system, one set of highways from Chile to Alaska, and this is the new system, my friend.
[01:16:05.765 --> 01:16:06.165]  Oh, boy.
[01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:10.673]  Well, I'll let you go and let other people get on.
[01:16:11.574 --> 01:16:13.456]  And thank you very much for what you're doing.
[01:16:14.097 --> 01:16:16.279]  Well, thank you for the call, sir.
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.863]  Since you mentioned this, Marty, let me go ahead and read the article.
[01:16:19.903 --> 01:16:21.905]  This is out of Arizona Republic yesterday.
[01:16:22.226 --> 01:16:24.909]  Social Security checks could go south of border.
[01:16:25.449 --> 01:16:25.630]  U.S.
[01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:27.792]  and Mexican officials are discussing an agreement.
[01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:29.530]  See, it's already an agreement.
[01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:34.151]  They're allowing millions of Mexicans to return home and still collect U.S.
[01:16:34.191 --> 01:16:35.171]  Social Security benefits.
[01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:39.292]  The controversial proposal that could transfer hundreds of millions of dollars in Social Security payments.
[01:16:40.493 --> 01:16:41.633]  It'll be a billion in the first year.
[01:16:42.073 --> 01:16:44.853]  South of the border has riled some Republican lawmakers.
[01:16:44.893 --> 01:16:48.734]  They worry that it could reward scores of undocumented Mexican immigrants with a U.S.
[01:16:48.794 --> 01:16:55.276]  pension, draining the country's Social Security trust fund at a time when its future solvency is in doubt.
[01:16:55.316 --> 01:16:56.956]  Don't worry, we can just have a tax raise.
[01:16:58.283 --> 01:16:58.964]  Hello, Alex.
[01:16:59.424 --> 01:16:59.524]  Yes.
[01:17:20.746 --> 01:17:28.368]  I was wanting to get your comment on House Bill 2417, the Privacy Disclosure Act, or about the sign.
[01:17:29.548 --> 01:17:41.050]  Gary Brownfield did his whole show on that yesterday about the areas that they can touch on the... Yeah, why don't you fill them in a little bit?
[01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:43.491]  I mean, I'm familiar with the bill, but I don't have an article in front of me.
[01:17:44.071 --> 01:17:48.292]  Well, it's a new bill that's going to broaden the FBI powers...
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:57.664]  And they can essentially just request records on you from banks and credit unions, which they always could.
[01:17:57.804 --> 01:17:59.404]  And now it'll be gold dealers.
[01:17:59.484 --> 01:18:06.127]  Exchanges, car dealers, travel agencies, post offices, casinos, pawnbrokers, and the whole shooting bag.
[01:18:06.147 --> 01:18:09.288]  Yeah, I had an article on that yesterday and for some reason just mentioned it.
[01:18:10.089 --> 01:18:11.449]  But it's the Patriot Act.
[01:18:12.369 --> 01:18:13.770]  It's the subsections there.
[01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:18.532]  And now they're repassing a new law reaffirming that
[01:18:19.304 --> 01:18:21.445]  And, yeah, you refreshed my memory.
[01:18:21.525 --> 01:18:25.347]  George Bush has not signed it that I know of as of yesterday.
[01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:28.429]  Yeah, I know people were calling to have Bush not sign it.
[01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:35.473]  They're trying to get him to... The fact is they're trying to file suit to get the whole thing stopped until they can have more debate on it.
[01:18:35.733 --> 01:18:37.714]  And, again, it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:18:37.934 --> 01:18:38.194]  No.
[01:18:38.655 --> 01:18:41.496]  It's just no Fourth Amendment of any type anymore.
[01:18:41.856 --> 01:18:43.617]  That appears to be a slider.
[01:18:43.657 --> 01:18:44.318]  They passed it on the 20th of...
[01:18:46.894 --> 01:18:50.416]  November in one of those middle-of-the-night sessions, I guess.
[01:18:51.437 --> 01:18:54.920]  I don't think half the people that voted for it knew what they were voting for.
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:58.782]  Yeah, I'll try to dig the stories out I had on it yesterday, but I've been hearing a lot about that.
[01:18:59.123 --> 01:19:00.423]  But basically, it's weird.
[01:19:00.463 --> 01:19:03.085]  They're duplicating stuff they already passed in Patriot Act 1.
[01:19:03.365 --> 01:19:07.268]  Well, here's the point he was talking about.
[01:19:07.748 --> 01:19:11.291]  I bought coins at Midas, and we've bought coins here and there, and
[01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:16.210]  We're going to go back in and demand the information on your purchases.
[01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:18.531]  Well, it's everything, as you said, from the articles.
[01:19:18.611 --> 01:19:25.013]  It's car dealers, it's credit unions, it's gold, it's your purchases, it's stores, what books you read.
[01:19:25.453 --> 01:19:26.433]  I mean, it's everything.
[01:19:26.453 --> 01:19:31.295]  And we as a society have to fight that, and it's warrantless searches.
[01:19:32.416 --> 01:19:40.201]  But the key is when people are invaded by this, they need to scream bloody murder and not go along with it.
[01:19:40.581 --> 01:19:41.422]  But you watch.
[01:19:41.482 --> 01:19:42.403]  Bush is going to sign it.
[01:19:43.403 --> 01:19:45.905]  I mean, look, he just said he loves China and forget Taiwan.
[01:19:45.965 --> 01:19:47.486]  I mean, you know, Ridge says open borders.
[01:19:47.586 --> 01:19:50.068]  It's just, this is the neocon world.
[01:19:50.088 --> 01:19:51.029]  We'll be back with more calls.

[01:22:52.421 --> 01:22:58.665]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:22:58.805 --> 01:23:04.950]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:13.676]  Incredibly, the low energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:23:13.936 --> 01:23:20.941]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:23:21.261 --> 01:23:21.902]  We're good to go.
[01:23:21.922 --> 01:23:22.382]  We're good to go.
[01:24:03.528 --> 01:24:04.749]  I can't back down, folks.
[01:24:04.769 --> 01:24:05.969]  The globalists are too evil.
[01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:08.270]  We can't let these criminals get more control over us.
[01:24:11.151 --> 01:24:18.434]  Coming up in about ten minutes or so, we've got Phyllis Schlafly on, and we're going to take calls quickly in the interview, talk about a bunch of different issues, and the neocons with her.
[01:24:18.474 --> 01:24:19.495]  See what she has to say.
[01:24:20.635 --> 01:24:24.657]  Right now, let's go to Leon and JQ, John, Spencer, Jim, and others.
[01:24:25.377 --> 01:24:27.278]  Leon in Colorado, you're on the air.
[01:24:27.338 --> 01:24:27.658]  Welcome.
[01:24:28.458 --> 01:24:29.659]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:24:29.939 --> 01:24:30.319]  You bet.
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:32.060]  I had...
[01:24:33.217 --> 01:24:36.278]  I didn't have the opportunity to listen to you until American Freedom put you on.
[01:24:36.318 --> 01:24:38.359]  That's where I'm listening to you, out of Johnstown.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:49.784]  And my sister that lives in Utah sent me your video, 9-11 to... What is it?
[01:24:49.804 --> 01:24:50.464]  9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[01:24:50.524 --> 01:24:50.944]  That's it.
[01:24:52.005 --> 01:25:02.849]  And I just watched it last night, and I just wanted to tell you that I saw the pork-cutting bombs...
[01:25:03.499 --> 01:25:13.002]  On TV for, and I just wish that I'd had enough sense to record it at the time of the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:25:13.162 --> 01:25:22.945]  I saw three of those, and they were in canisters that that P-4 explosive comes in, military canisters.
[01:25:23.305 --> 01:25:26.106]  Yeah, we have the newscast where they're taking the bombs out of the building.
[01:25:26.506 --> 01:25:29.607]  Anyway, now I'm glad I have this because now people...
[01:25:31.038 --> 01:25:37.243]  That I've been talking to, telling me I'm crazy, I'm going to bring him in and show up to him and say, okay, now you tell me I'm crazy.
[01:25:38.124 --> 01:25:44.709]  But I called you because last night I was watching O'Reilly, and they had this flake, and he's a flake.
[01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:46.591]  He's from Arizona.
[01:25:46.611 --> 01:25:53.676]  O'Reilly was confronting him as to why we couldn't put the military on the border.
[01:25:54.697 --> 01:25:58.440]  You know, and he did all the usual globalist double talk about how this would work.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:00.322]  Well, do you have that congressman on?
[01:26:00.482 --> 01:26:00.722]  Flake.
[01:26:01.843 --> 01:26:02.663]  His name was Flake.
[01:26:03.284 --> 01:26:04.224]  F-L-A-K-E.
[01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:04.864]  Flake, I think.
[01:26:05.985 --> 01:26:06.925]  No, his name is Flake.
[01:26:06.945 --> 01:26:07.486]  He's a Flake.
[01:26:07.866 --> 01:26:12.908]  I think he's probably a descendant of the people that settled Snowflake, Arizona.
[01:26:12.988 --> 01:26:15.109]  One was Flake family, and the other was Snow.
[01:26:15.569 --> 01:26:16.410]  That's how it got its name.
[01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:30.816]  Anyway, the other thing is, there was a doctor on, and I wish I'd have been running around doing things, and I wish I'd have written his name down, but he was a congressman, and he's written a book, and he's a doctor, and he was saying that the
[01:26:31.676 --> 01:26:35.357]  Problem with our Congress is that they don't fix any problems.
[01:26:35.478 --> 01:26:37.898]  All they do is worry about getting re-elected.
[01:26:39.339 --> 01:26:39.779]  You see that?
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:41.200]  Well, of course.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.642]  And also, if they don't follow orders, a lot of times they have plane crashes.
[01:26:47.362 --> 01:26:49.463]  Yeah, well, they get all their money from the globalists.
[01:26:49.483 --> 01:26:50.543]  That's how they get re-elected.
[01:26:50.804 --> 01:26:53.985]  And they get their time on their globalist stations and all that stuff.
[01:26:54.665 --> 01:26:59.487]  But the other thing I wanted to say real quick, and that was about two weeks ago, I've been trying to get on.
[01:27:00.538 --> 01:27:04.603]  Oh, Dean was up there giving a speech someplace, and he was saying, I want my country back.
[01:27:04.663 --> 01:27:05.604]  I want my country back.
[01:27:05.724 --> 01:27:08.447]  And I thought, huh?
[01:27:08.467 --> 01:27:10.510]  Do you hear him saying that?
[01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:16.737]  Well, yeah, they have a lot of leftists out and establishment types acting like they want to fix things.
[01:27:17.504 --> 01:27:20.526]  And that's because the people are demanding it.
[01:27:20.566 --> 01:27:21.847]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[01:27:22.547 --> 01:27:23.228]  I appreciate it.
[01:27:23.768 --> 01:27:26.270]  They're having to respond because they know there's so much pressure.
[01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:28.151]  They have to act like they're changing something.
[01:27:28.832 --> 01:27:30.553]  JQ in Oregon, you're on the air.
[01:27:30.593 --> 01:27:31.033]  Go ahead.
[01:27:31.653 --> 01:27:32.514]  Well, howdy, Alex.
[01:27:33.695 --> 01:27:35.676]  Yeah, I was listening to George Gordon.
[01:27:35.736 --> 01:27:37.557]  I think he's on this network.
[01:27:38.498 --> 01:27:45.563]  And he pointed out, kind of in passing, that if you take all debt, public and private, the American people owe $100,000.
[01:27:46.687 --> 01:27:49.349]  And $49 trillion.
[01:27:51.531 --> 01:27:56.555]  Now we can't even possibly pay the interest on that, let alone paying it off.
[01:27:57.416 --> 01:28:09.986]  What happens when a debtor has nothing to offer other than his body and the bodies of his children to the creditor?
[01:28:10.246 --> 01:28:11.007]  What happens then?
[01:28:13.699 --> 01:28:20.704]  The Dallas Morning News had a leading economist on a few months ago in their article, and they said it's $43-plus trillion.
[01:28:21.805 --> 01:28:26.087]  American Free Press estimated $70 trillion federal debt.
[01:28:26.728 --> 01:28:29.790]  Now, that's the allowances for what they've committed to.
[01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:37.315]  So when the media talks about it... So it's a little bit different baseline.
[01:28:37.795 --> 01:28:42.258]  Okay, well, the only thing that can happen is that the debtor becomes a slave.
[01:28:43.223 --> 01:28:44.224]  There's no other option.
[01:28:45.104 --> 01:28:46.505]  I just wanted to point that out.
[01:28:48.467 --> 01:28:49.327]  Well, no, I agree with you.
[01:28:49.347 --> 01:28:50.688]  Okay, I'll let you be.
[01:28:52.369 --> 01:29:05.538]  I have no doubt that public and private and corporate and all of it mixed together is over $100 trillion if the federal, even the mainstream media, quietly admits is over $40 trillion.
[01:29:05.558 --> 01:29:07.499]  $40 trillion.
[01:29:07.519 --> 01:29:08.560]  $40 trillion.
[01:29:09.207 --> 01:29:10.848]  And again, the bankers run things.
[01:29:10.908 --> 01:29:12.029]  They own the money machines.
[01:29:12.449 --> 01:29:13.670]  They print up the money.
[01:29:15.732 --> 01:29:17.973]  They add the zeros and ones in the computer systems.
[01:29:18.013 --> 01:29:21.015]  They've done this by design to get control.
[01:29:21.035 --> 01:29:22.196]  Do you understand that, folks?
[01:29:23.037 --> 01:29:24.498]  Phyllis Schlafly's up next.
[01:29:25.278 --> 01:29:27.940]  And we'll get to John and Spencer and Jim and others as well.
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.941]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:40.769]  2599231.
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:40.769]  We'll ask Phyllis Schlafly about Governor Red saying he wants open borders and Bush saying Taiwan is going to be cut loose.
[01:29:40.789 --> 01:29:41.209]  Stay with us.
[01:29:43.972 --> 01:29:44.853]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.373 --> 01:29:46.975]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.876 --> 01:29:50.599]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.344 --> 01:29:57.248]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[01:29:57.268 --> 01:29:59.250]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[01:29:59.430 --> 01:30:05.077]  Cheaperhotels.com, saveonyourrentalcar.com, halfpriceairlinetickets.com.
[01:30:05.137 --> 01:30:10.924]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.
[01:30:11.104 --> 01:30:13.507]  I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.

[01:30:53.157 --> 01:30:53.577]  Gold.

[01:30:55.478 --> 01:31:01.580]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:05.582]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:31:05.942 --> 01:31:07.823]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:31:07.883 --> 01:31:10.164]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:31:10.304 --> 01:31:10.864]  The stage is
[01:31:10.964 --> 01:31:11.784]  We're good to go.

[01:32:48.519 --> 01:32:48.739]  P.O.

[01:32:51.060 --> 01:33:09.171]  From Rhode Island to Los Angeles, California, we blast out on the AM and FM dialed.
[01:33:10.091 --> 01:33:13.993]  Simulcasting at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:15.034 --> 01:33:19.977]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 at 12.172 and 93.20.
[01:33:20.037 --> 01:33:25.080]  At night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:34.606]  Now, every day at 10 a.m., we air the Phyllis Schlafly Eagle Forum Report.
[01:33:34.886 --> 01:33:37.908]  It's about three minutes long, great little vignettes of information.
[01:33:39.424 --> 01:33:44.989]  And I almost always agree with the information she's covering on her little exposés.
[01:33:45.349 --> 01:33:46.770]  And I've interviewed her several times.
[01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:48.011]  It's been about five years.
[01:33:48.092 --> 01:33:51.394]  I was thinking, why haven't I had her back on the show?
[01:33:51.474 --> 01:34:02.784]  So we're going to her here in just a few minutes, and I want to talk about how they're banning somebody at a graduation ceremony in their speech saying the word Jesus, which is a violation of the First Amendment.
[01:34:03.485 --> 01:34:04.525]  Why are they moving ahead?
[01:34:04.565 --> 01:34:07.368]  Why is Bush moving ahead to put women in the military just like Clinton?
[01:34:09.003 --> 01:34:10.904]  What's happening with the cameras in the schools?
[01:34:10.944 --> 01:34:13.005]  What's happening to our liberties under the Patriot Act?
[01:34:13.345 --> 01:34:19.527]  I want to talk about all this with Phyllis Shafley coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:30.311]  Before I do that, I want to remind everybody that I'm going to be in Houston, Texas this Saturday at the Alamo Drafthouse Movie Theater at the West Oaks Shopping Center from 6 to midnight.
[01:34:30.351 --> 01:34:32.112]  I'm going to air 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:34:32.692 --> 01:34:34.075]  Then I'm going to have a question and answer.
[01:34:34.095 --> 01:34:35.136]  We're going to give a speech.
[01:34:35.537 --> 01:34:41.527]  I'm going to air John Carpenter's They Live, a good film for getting your mind outside the box and seeing the big picture.
[01:34:41.547 --> 01:34:43.310]  It's kind of an analogy of what we face.
[01:34:45.134 --> 01:34:46.335]  A great place to network.
[01:34:46.375 --> 01:34:48.356]  A lot of wonderful people will be there.
[01:34:48.536 --> 01:34:52.578]  Last time it sold out, right when it started, some folks showed up late and got turned away.
[01:34:52.598 --> 01:35:01.102]  So get up there a little bit early or buy your tickets online at infowars.com via the Alamo Drafthouse website, drafthouse.com.
[01:35:01.122 --> 01:35:02.923]  It's the West Oaks link, folks.
[01:35:03.958 --> 01:35:05.639]  And also, I've made ten films.
[01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:13.822]  The latest is Matrix of Evil with Congressman Ron Paul, Frank Morales, police state expert, Colonel Craig Roberts, myself.
[01:35:14.122 --> 01:35:16.003]  It's over two hours long, $25.95.
[01:35:17.284 --> 01:35:22.126]  We covered it all, the New World Order, what the leftists are up to, the neocon agenda.
[01:35:23.363 --> 01:35:27.127]  We get into solutions to fight the New World Order.
[01:35:27.147 --> 01:35:28.328]  It's a great new film.
[01:35:28.348 --> 01:35:30.050]  There's also 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[01:35:30.570 --> 01:35:34.814]  There's Masters of Terror Exposed, Dark Secrets, Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:35:35.515 --> 01:35:36.836]  My book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:35:37.097 --> 01:35:41.841]  Paul Watson's book I published, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror and the New World Order.
[01:35:42.262 --> 01:35:44.444]  You need to have all these books and films.
[01:35:44.884 --> 01:35:46.425]  And it also supports what we're doing here.
[01:35:46.805 --> 01:35:51.088]  Infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:51.128 --> 01:35:51.468]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:51.488 --> 01:35:54.290]  And the mailing address is 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:36:10.293 --> 01:36:15.098]  And remember, when you get three or more of any of the videos, they drop down to $20 apiece, a big discount.
[01:36:16.279 --> 01:36:26.789]  Phyllis Shafley has been a national leader of the conservative movement since the publication of her best-selling book in 1964, A Choice, Not an Echo.
[01:36:26.889 --> 01:36:33.896]  She has been a leader of the pro-family movement since 72, when she started her national volunteer organization now called Eagle Forum.
[01:36:34.457 --> 01:36:35.459]  In a 10-year battle, Ms.
[01:36:35.479 --> 01:36:43.250]  Shafley led the pro-family movement, a victory over the principal legislative goal of the radical feminists called the Equal Rights Amendment.
[01:36:44.028 --> 01:36:45.368]  And she's done so much more.
[01:36:45.388 --> 01:36:47.969]  I mean, her bio section's five pages long on the website.
[01:36:48.349 --> 01:36:49.490]  She's written a bunch of books.
[01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:53.591]  Again, does radio broadcasts and interviews, lectures all over the country.
[01:36:54.211 --> 01:36:58.632]  And the website's eagleforum.org, eagleforum.org.
[01:36:58.672 --> 01:37:00.012]  There's a link to it on my website.
[01:37:00.733 --> 01:37:02.453]  Phyllis, good to have you on the show.
[01:37:02.693 --> 01:37:03.933]  Yes, so happy to join you.
[01:37:04.013 --> 01:37:05.974]  After a long time, it's been too long.
[01:37:06.734 --> 01:37:12.996]  Absolutely, and I always enjoy every morning while I'm getting ready for my show, an hour before I go on air listening to your...
[01:37:14.116 --> 01:37:14.797]  Your insight.
[01:37:16.078 --> 01:37:21.102]  Tell us, what are the biggest things we face right now that could destroy our free country?
[01:37:21.842 --> 01:37:26.146]  Well, I think one of the biggest things is the out-of-control federal courts.
[01:37:27.307 --> 01:37:34.693]  The judicial activists are trying to make law to do things that no elected legislature would do.
[01:37:35.454 --> 01:37:43.180]  And so we find this tremendous attack in state after state to get rid of the Pledge of Allegiance, to get rid of the Ten Commandments,
[01:37:43.815 --> 01:37:45.275]  And to redefine marriage.
[01:37:46.155 --> 01:37:50.096]  And these actions are not being taken by our elected public officials.
[01:37:50.616 --> 01:38:01.798]  They're being done by appointed judges who are simply out of control, who simply have the idea that they should be able to make law and tell us what to do.
[01:38:01.818 --> 01:38:04.319]  And that is not the function of the courts.
[01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:07.559]  The courts should be like baseball umpires.
[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:10.360]  We need them to call the close ones,
[01:38:10.834 --> 01:38:13.757]  But they cannot rewrite the rules of the game.
[01:38:14.558 --> 01:38:18.882]  If an umpire called a batter out after two strikes, you know what the fans would do to him.
[01:38:19.983 --> 01:38:31.114]  And so we cannot let the judges presume to make laws such as telling us we can't have the Pledge of Allegiance or the Ten Commandments or we can't have marriage as a man and a woman.
[01:38:32.441 --> 01:38:33.303]  Well, absolutely.
[01:38:33.323 --> 01:38:34.445]  In fact, here's an example.
[01:38:34.525 --> 01:38:35.466]  In Texas, a U.S.
[01:38:35.506 --> 01:38:41.637]  District Judge decreed that any student uttering the word Jesus at his school graduation would be arrested and locked up.
[01:38:41.677 --> 01:38:42.819]  Here's the quote from the judge.
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:44.362]  And make no mistake.
[01:38:44.969 --> 01:38:51.472]  According to Judge Samuel B. Kent, the court, quote, is going to have a United States Marshal in attendance at the graduation.
[01:38:51.492 --> 01:39:00.896]  If any student offends this court, the student will be summarily arrested and will face up to six months incarceration in the Galveston County Jail for contempt of court.
[01:39:01.256 --> 01:39:04.978]  Now, I would expect to see that in Beijing, China, but not in Galveston, Texas.
[01:39:06.219 --> 01:39:06.979]  That's outrageous.
[01:39:07.639 --> 01:39:08.399]  Isn't it outrageous?
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:11.661]  There's nothing in the Constitution that says we cannot acknowledge God.
[01:39:12.301 --> 01:39:13.822]  And this is why I am urging...
[01:39:14.352 --> 01:39:14.973]  That the U.S.
[01:39:15.053 --> 01:39:19.736]  Congress exercised its rights, established in Article III of the U.S.
[01:39:19.797 --> 01:39:25.781]  Constitution, to withdraw jurisdiction from the courts over the acknowledgement of God.
[01:39:26.142 --> 01:39:33.688]  And this would take care of the Ten Commandments and the Pledge of Allegiance cases, and they are popping up all over the country.
[01:39:34.594 --> 01:39:40.539]  Well, I mean, they're seizing kindergartners that say, God is great, God is good, let us thank him for our food.
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:44.703]  But then there's a Muslim with a headdress on right next to them.
[01:39:45.443 --> 01:39:46.984]  This is mind control.
[01:39:47.045 --> 01:39:48.306]  This is thought crime.
[01:39:48.606 --> 01:39:49.687]  This is Orwellian.
[01:39:49.707 --> 01:39:58.914]  This judge says if you offend the court in your valedictorian speech and say the word Jesus, I mean, we can say whatever we want in a speech we give.
[01:39:59.115 --> 01:40:01.797]  It has nothing to do with the state and religion.
[01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:03.550]  That's right.
[01:40:03.610 --> 01:40:10.454]  And what I want the American people to understand is that the problem is not the graduation speech.
[01:40:10.534 --> 01:40:13.295]  The problem is the out-of-control federal court.
[01:40:14.295 --> 01:40:22.940]  And in Article III of the Constitution, Congress is given the power to create all of the federal courts except the Supreme Court.
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:32.044]  And whatever Congress can create, it can uncreate or regulate or abolish or tell them what cases they can hear and what they cannot hear.
[01:40:33.047 --> 01:40:50.511]  And what is at issue in this matter of the valedictorian speeches or the Pledge of Allegiance or the Ten Commandments monuments or our motto in God we trust or the oath we take, so help me God, is the acknowledgement of God.
[01:40:51.251 --> 01:40:54.512]  And there's nothing in the Constitution that prohibits that.
[01:40:54.552 --> 01:40:57.653]  Well, you said in one of your speeches a few days ago that
[01:40:58.402 --> 01:40:59.542]  Yes, that's exactly right.
[01:40:59.562 --> 01:40:59.622]  And...
[01:41:26.943 --> 01:41:34.249]  Well, I guess you heard that in the California schools, they spend three weeks studying Muslims.
[01:41:34.349 --> 01:41:35.650]  Well, they dress up like Muslims.
[01:41:35.670 --> 01:41:37.132]  They dress up.
[01:41:37.212 --> 01:41:41.035]  Now, this is not a course in different cultures.
[01:41:41.075 --> 01:41:45.639]  This is behavior modification to get them accustomed to the Islam religion.
[01:41:46.179 --> 01:41:49.322]  And that shouldn't be allowed, and yet it's going on all the time.
[01:41:50.515 --> 01:41:54.419]  Phyllis, look, you've done so much good, and I want to talk about your books, your films.
[01:41:54.539 --> 01:41:56.140]  I mean, I've seen you change lives.
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:57.121]  You've done so much.
[01:41:57.742 --> 01:41:59.443]  But I've got to be honest with you here.
[01:41:59.463 --> 01:42:07.171]  Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, and I know you've been on their shows and talked to them, and they're nice to you and all.
[01:42:07.842 --> 01:42:09.483]  Bill Clinton couldn't have done something this bad.
[01:42:35.715 --> 01:42:36.476]  What do we do?
[01:42:37.156 --> 01:42:38.617]  What do we do about the neocons?
[01:42:38.637 --> 01:42:45.441]  Let me tell you, they're energizing the left, and we're going to get a Democrat in there, and it's going to be a holy jihad by these people.
[01:42:45.801 --> 01:42:53.185]  And George Bush, I have to tell you, it's a Republican Supreme Court that's going along with this, saying they're going to follow the U.N.
[01:42:53.906 --> 01:42:55.567]  What's your comments to that barrage?
[01:42:55.607 --> 01:43:04.692]  It is true that seven of the nine justices are appointed by Republican presidents who were just simply somehow cheated or misled.
[01:43:05.205 --> 01:43:07.247]  By the people they appointed.
[01:43:08.448 --> 01:43:17.476]  For example, Ronald Reagan appointed Sandra O'Connor, and he made the mistake, during his campaign, of saying he was going to appoint a woman.
[01:43:18.057 --> 01:43:25.303]  And then she was the only woman he was shown, and my guess is he said to her, Sandra, of course you're pro-life, aren't you?
[01:43:25.443 --> 01:43:27.145]  And she said, of course, Mr. President.
[01:43:27.905 --> 01:43:31.329]  And then she went right ahead...
[01:43:32.596 --> 01:43:44.402]  Okay, well, why is Bush... He says it's status quo.
[01:43:44.702 --> 01:43:45.742]  It's not status quo.
[01:43:45.863 --> 01:43:52.346]  Our treaty, our 53-year-old treaty with Taiwan says they're sovereign, we recognize them, we'll protect you.
[01:43:52.726 --> 01:43:58.729]  Now Bush changes horses in the middle of the stream and says, hey, you better back off.
[01:44:00.429 --> 01:44:00.690]  Well...
[01:44:02.032 --> 01:44:11.303]  It was very disturbing what he said about that, because our friendship with Taiwan goes back many, many years, and we do have a treaty saying they will protect them.
[01:44:11.964 --> 01:44:13.927]  And of course we want them to be independent.
[01:44:14.788 --> 01:44:21.476]  But it's the multinationals who have their investments in China, and they speak with a big voice in Washington.
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:23.162]  And so, yeah, that's it.
[01:44:23.623 --> 01:44:31.814]  Whatever the communist murderers want, now they get... I remember three years ago, they had the Tiananmen Square march with the Fortune 500 there.
[01:44:31.834 --> 01:44:33.376]  I mean, it's just...
[01:44:34.781 --> 01:44:35.841]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:44:36.241 --> 01:44:45.963]  Okay, well, Governor Ridge, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, expression of support for giving legal status to immigrants through congressional criticism Wednesday.
[01:44:46.523 --> 01:44:47.723]  Tell me what he said.
[01:44:48.123 --> 01:44:50.404]  Okay, let me find the quote here.
[01:44:50.444 --> 01:44:59.785]  At a town hall meeting in Miami, Ridge said, the country needs to come to grips with an estimate of 8 million to 12 million illegal immigrants and determine how you can legalize their presence.
[01:45:00.465 --> 01:45:01.066]  That's a quote.
[01:45:02.426 --> 01:45:03.426]  Well, that's an outrage.
[01:45:04.164 --> 01:45:07.207]  These are people who violated the law in coming into the country.
[01:45:08.308 --> 01:45:11.692]  And what we should do is what President Eisenhower did.
[01:45:12.433 --> 01:45:14.034]  President Eisenhower sent them back.
[01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:25.446]  Yeah, and that's operations where we get the... And what they ought to do is go after the employers, and if their jobs drive up, they will voluntarily walk back.
[01:45:26.041 --> 01:45:48.921]  Well, see, fellas, I agree with you, and I agree with everything you say on the radio, but, and again, I'm not, my point is here, I got on radio, I do what I do, because I love the republic, the constitution, you know, our families, and I'm telling you, I'm watching what's happening here, the explosion in government, Bush signing on to UNESCO, signing campaign finance reform, supercomputers to communist China, Rumsfeld with reactors in North Korea.
[01:45:49.281 --> 01:45:52.604]  I mean, do you agree with Ron Paul and what he said about the neocons?
[01:45:54.454 --> 01:45:56.394]  Well, I don't have that in front of me.
[01:45:56.494 --> 01:46:10.637]  Certainly, they have their own agenda, and it does seem to call for trying to spread democracy around the rest of the world, and I really don't think that that's a realistic goal.
[01:46:12.257 --> 01:46:22.539]  I think they also are big government people, and I thought the foundation of conservatism was to be for limited, smaller governments.
[01:46:23.473 --> 01:46:24.874]  Okay, so here's my question to you.
[01:46:24.894 --> 01:46:28.135]  You've been doing this longer than I have, and a lot of us combined here.
[01:46:28.555 --> 01:46:29.516]  What do we do then?
[01:46:29.836 --> 01:46:36.018]  How do we force Bush when 87% of us, 89% of us, want closed borders and it's constitutional?
[01:46:36.479 --> 01:46:38.660]  What do we do when the majority of us are pro-gun?
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:40.800]  He's going to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.
[01:46:41.261 --> 01:46:48.964]  How do we force the Congress and Bush to enforce the law and carry out the will of the people?
[01:46:50.717 --> 01:46:53.339]  Well, it's a tough goal.
[01:46:53.859 --> 01:46:55.160]  There's no question about that.
[01:46:55.660 --> 01:47:02.285]  But you saw what happened when the grassroots made CBS cancel their Reagan travesty.
[01:47:02.985 --> 01:47:08.229]  They got 80,000 emails, and that powerful organization backed up.
[01:47:08.869 --> 01:47:14.653]  And I think the grassroots are going to have to be better informed and more vocal about what they want.
[01:47:15.399 --> 01:47:20.501]  And make sure and go after their congressmen and senators to get what they want.
[01:47:20.802 --> 01:47:28.565]  You know, the question I get everywhere I go is, why don't the Republicans say something about the immigration border security issue?
[01:47:29.485 --> 01:47:31.066]  And why don't the Democrats?
[01:47:31.146 --> 01:47:36.068]  Well, the Democrats don't because they think they're going to get the votes of those people.
[01:47:36.689 --> 01:47:40.871]  And the Republicans don't because a lot of their contributors like the cheap labor.
[01:47:41.731 --> 01:47:44.032]  And I think we have to get this out on the table.
[01:47:44.542 --> 01:47:51.144]  Now, I get money solicitations every week from the Republican National Committee and other top Republicans.
[01:47:51.644 --> 01:47:54.725]  And you know, they're always asking for our opinion about issues.
[01:47:54.765 --> 01:47:55.705]  They don't want our opinion.
[01:47:55.725 --> 01:47:56.725]  They just want the check.
[01:47:57.586 --> 01:47:59.166]  But they do have these surveys.
[01:47:59.946 --> 01:48:03.207]  And they never ask any questions about immigration.
[01:48:03.247 --> 01:48:05.288]  They don't want to know what we think about it.
[01:48:05.828 --> 01:48:11.690]  Because all the polls show that the American people are upset about the high cost of illegal aliens.
[01:48:11.770 --> 01:48:12.470]  And do you know...
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:22.245]  That in this Medicare prescription bill that just passed, it contains $1 billion to pay hospital costs for illegal aliens?
[01:48:22.485 --> 01:48:23.185]  Did you know that?
[01:48:23.205 --> 01:48:27.888]  Yeah, I know that almost the entire deficit of California has been caused by the illegals.
[01:48:27.908 --> 01:48:32.530]  I mean, you've got a $30 billion shortfall, and lo and behold, the illegals are costing them $30 billion a year.
[01:48:32.610 --> 01:48:36.032]  And that's the fault of the federal government for letting them in.
[01:48:36.252 --> 01:48:42.315]  Okay, Phyllis Shavely, founder and the head of the Eagle Forum, eagleforum.org, let me ask you this question.
[01:48:43.190 --> 01:48:44.831]  I mean, let's boil it down here.
[01:48:46.512 --> 01:48:48.414]  Hillary Clinton, pure evil.
[01:48:48.554 --> 01:48:50.495]  Dean, I mean, scary.
[01:48:51.576 --> 01:48:54.137]  Wesley Clark, Rhodes Scholar, Bill Clinton's roommate.
[01:48:54.257 --> 01:48:54.738]  All bad.
[01:48:56.099 --> 01:48:57.259]  Kerry, you know, dropped out.
[01:48:57.319 --> 01:48:57.940]  Skull and bones.
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:58.920]  Ooh, just like Bush.
[01:48:59.421 --> 01:49:05.685]  We're looking at all of this, but if Al Gore would have been elected, conservatives wouldn't have gone to sleep...
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:09.482]  And I don't think we would have seen as much of this happen.
[01:49:10.423 --> 01:49:16.467]  Now, my point here is that people say, well, you've got to elect Bush for the judges, but again, you just said it about the judges.
[01:49:16.487 --> 01:49:18.289]  Look at these Republican judges, what's happening.
[01:49:18.609 --> 01:49:19.530]  I don't see a difference.
[01:49:19.570 --> 01:49:20.831]  My listeners don't see a difference.
[01:49:21.351 --> 01:49:24.953]  And I've done 1,000-plus interviews the last two and a half years on the radio.
[01:49:25.234 --> 01:49:26.495]  People are sick of this.
[01:49:26.775 --> 01:49:28.236]  They're seeing right through it.
[01:49:28.476 --> 01:49:30.297]  We're coming to a crisis point here.
[01:49:30.878 --> 01:49:35.301]  And, I mean, if George Bush is reelected, I just see the same thing happening.
[01:49:36.966 --> 01:49:40.888]  Well, that is indeed very depressing.
[01:49:41.508 --> 01:49:47.510]  And yet, there is the opportunity for the grassroots to get informed and to make their wishes known.
[01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:51.172]  And I really think Howard Dean has shown the way.
[01:49:52.452 --> 01:49:55.873]  We don't like anything he says, but it's the technique of it.
[01:49:56.874 --> 01:50:03.456]  According to Dick Morris, all the other Democratic candidates have 30,000 contributors, but Howard Dean has 300,000.
[01:50:05.486 --> 01:50:06.126]  Well, yeah, Dean is going...
[01:50:32.566 --> 01:50:40.192]  And between talk radio and the Internet and a little bit on cable, we can turn this country around.
[01:50:41.313 --> 01:50:42.914]  Well, I know the people are hungry for it.
[01:50:42.934 --> 01:50:44.875]  I know we've got the majority to do the job.
[01:50:44.895 --> 01:50:48.898]  It doesn't even take a majority, but stay there, Phyllis Schlafly.
[01:50:48.918 --> 01:50:52.681]  We're going to come back and cover some more issues, women in the military, and we'll take some calls.
[01:50:54.611 --> 01:51:01.996]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:51:02.256 --> 01:51:07.019]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:51:07.219 --> 01:51:12.883]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:51:13.123 --> 01:51:17.646]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:51:17.866 --> 01:51:25.011]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:51:25.031 --> 01:51:29.574]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:51:29.734 --> 01:51:32.256]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:51:32.476 --> 01:51:39.181]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:51:39.421 --> 01:51:44.686]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:44.706 --> 01:51:45.107]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:54.727 --> 01:51:55.067]  We're good to go.
[01:52:19.079 --> 01:52:20.020]  We're good to go.
[01:52:46.683 --> 01:52:59.145]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:52:59.285 --> 01:52:59.906]  Yes, it's true.
[01:52:59.926 --> 01:53:02.686]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:53:02.806 --> 01:53:06.807]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:53:06.887 --> 01:53:07.447]  You heard it right.
[01:53:07.607 --> 01:53:12.588]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:53:12.668 --> 01:53:13.688]  The list goes on and on.
[01:53:13.888 --> 01:53:14.268]  We're good to go.
[01:53:30.606 --> 01:53:31.186]  We're good to go.
[01:53:31.246 --> 01:53:31.666]  We're good to go.
[01:53:58.684 --> 01:54:00.585]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:01.086 --> 01:54:03.908]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:08.571]  I want Congress to repeal the assault weapons ban.
[01:54:08.731 --> 01:54:12.374]  I want Bush to get out of UNESCO, something Ronald Reagan pulled out of.
[01:54:13.975 --> 01:54:17.317]  I want Bush to arm Taiwan and not arm North Korea.
[01:54:18.178 --> 01:54:23.862]  I'm a communist, according to the neocons, folks, because I'm pro-gun and I'm against communism.
[01:54:24.262 --> 01:54:25.403]  These people make me sick.
[01:54:26.050 --> 01:54:33.796]  And I'm not going to say that Phyllis Shafley even consorts with the neocons, but, I mean, certainly they praise her trying to act like they're conservative.
[01:54:34.257 --> 01:54:35.037]  And I'm sick of it.
[01:54:35.718 --> 01:54:39.341]  We've got Gina Spencer, Mike New Hampshire, many others wanting to talk to her.
[01:54:39.841 --> 01:54:44.204]  She's going to stay with us 20 minutes in the next hour, graciously, and we're going to talk about women in the military some.
[01:54:44.224 --> 01:54:49.749]  She's got amazing new statistics out of Israel on that and on the facts.
[01:54:51.272 --> 01:54:53.914]  But right now, let's go to Gina in Pennsylvania.
[01:54:54.274 --> 01:54:56.015]  Gina, you're on the air with Phyllis Schlafly.
[01:54:56.035 --> 01:54:56.436]  Go ahead.
[01:54:57.156 --> 01:54:57.696]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:58.037 --> 01:54:58.297]  Hey.
[01:54:58.597 --> 01:54:59.818]  Thanks for the opportunity.
[01:55:00.278 --> 01:55:00.538]  You bet.
[01:55:00.578 --> 01:55:01.079]  Go ahead.
[01:55:01.939 --> 01:55:04.221]  Phyllis Schlafly, you know, I've followed you for years.
[01:55:04.621 --> 01:55:08.644]  I'd like to know what grassroots movement you're going to get us involved with.
[01:55:09.364 --> 01:55:20.832]  You know, Representative Ron Paul in Texas in the middle of summer had a stop fund for UNESCO, a wonderful amendment to the Justice State Commerce Bill.
[01:55:21.405 --> 01:55:25.248]  I didn't hear a peep from anything from Phyllis Shafley to get on that.
[01:55:25.288 --> 01:55:29.150]  Now, you may have done it, but, you know, we got George Bush.
[01:55:29.190 --> 01:55:31.132]  We knew George Bush, what he was doing in Texas.
[01:55:31.172 --> 01:55:32.813]  We knew he had workforce development boards.
[01:55:33.253 --> 01:55:35.915]  Now these workforce development boards are running our counties.
[01:55:36.295 --> 01:55:37.296]  They're running our towns.
[01:55:37.656 --> 01:55:38.356]  They're appointed.
[01:55:39.137 --> 01:55:41.298]  We are inundated with confusion.
[01:55:41.358 --> 01:55:43.780]  Mr. Bush, as Alex said, put us into UNESCO.
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:45.881]  UNESCO means $60 million.
[01:55:46.122 --> 01:55:46.962]  This was all bad.
[01:55:46.982 --> 01:55:50.565]  Okay, let's let Phyllis comment on what you said.
[01:55:50.605 --> 01:55:51.045]  Go ahead, Phyllis.
[01:55:51.781 --> 01:55:52.982]  Well, you're right.
[01:55:53.222 --> 01:55:58.966]  I was too tied up with other issues that I didn't get on the UNESCO fight, but I completely agree with you.
[01:55:59.847 --> 01:56:07.192]  And everybody who knows me knows that I oppose UNESCO and think getting out of UNESCO is one of the best things that Ronald Reagan ever did.
[01:56:07.648 --> 01:56:09.048]  So why did Bush resign it?
[01:56:09.529 --> 01:56:12.510]  Well, you have to ask him.
[01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:14.230]  I don't think there was a good reason.
[01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:18.232]  I think Reagan got out because it's a thoroughly corrupt organization.
[01:56:18.812 --> 01:56:22.673]  However, I did spend a couple years of my life fighting...
[01:56:23.203 --> 01:56:29.266]  Outcome-based education, the school to work, the workforce development boards, and all those other things that you mentioned.
[01:56:29.487 --> 01:56:30.247]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:56:30.307 --> 01:56:42.053]  I mean, they use the Republican name, and then conservatives like yourself and a lot of people are kind of, yeah, Bush is doing it, man, it's bad, but there's not the heart there to go after Bush.
[01:56:42.133 --> 01:56:45.055]  People say, well, what are you going to be for, Howard Dean?
[01:56:45.335 --> 01:56:46.616]  I mean, I don't see it mattering.
[01:56:46.656 --> 01:56:48.477]  At least with Howard Dean, we know what we have.
[01:56:50.078 --> 01:56:50.318]  Well...
[01:56:51.659 --> 01:56:53.420]  Bush has done some good things.
[01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:58.442]  For example, he unsigned the U.N.
[01:56:58.482 --> 01:57:00.662]  Treaty on the International Criminal Court.
[01:57:00.842 --> 01:57:04.424]  And he's refused to go into the Kyoto Treaty.
[01:57:04.584 --> 01:57:06.724]  And he signed the partial birth abortion ban.
[01:57:07.025 --> 01:57:08.365]  So he's done a few good things.
[01:57:08.505 --> 01:57:10.226]  He better do something.
[01:57:10.246 --> 01:57:11.086]  He better do more.
[01:57:11.846 --> 01:57:13.607]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:57:13.707 --> 01:57:15.087]  And it was shaping up to be...
[01:57:17.695 --> 01:57:24.241]  The acid test was going to be his appointment to the Supreme Court, and now it looks like that's not going to happen before the next election.
[01:57:24.741 --> 01:57:26.743]  So we won't have that litmus paper test.
[01:57:28.644 --> 01:57:29.625]  Okay.
[01:57:29.645 --> 01:57:30.846]  You make some very good points.
[01:57:32.596 --> 01:57:35.518]  I'm not going to defend the bad things he did.
[01:57:35.538 --> 01:57:37.860]  Well, let's let Gina go ahead and finish up.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:57.852]  Well, as far as No Child Left Behind, I was half listening, so maybe I didn't get it right, but I believe on one of your commentaries coming over, I believe it was Gary Bromfield, or one of those shows, you mentioned that No Child Left Behind would give opportunity, was meant to give opportunity to all children or open up the avenue for all children.
[01:57:58.346 --> 01:58:02.090]  No, I don't think you heard me supporting No Child Left Behind.
[01:58:02.130 --> 01:58:05.113]  Well, you know, we knew that Bush was going to do this to us.
[01:58:05.213 --> 01:58:06.594]  We have No Child Left Behind.
[01:58:06.634 --> 01:58:11.559]  In Pennsylvania, we have the State Board of Education coming up with plans on illegals.
[01:58:12.219 --> 01:58:13.440]  All this is sent through.
[01:58:13.601 --> 01:58:14.962]  We can blame our governors.
[01:58:16.193 --> 01:58:22.378]  Gina, thank you for the call.
[01:58:22.398 --> 01:58:23.699]  We've got to end this hour.
[01:58:24.279 --> 01:58:26.581]  And again, we'll have Phyllis Schlafly for another 20 minutes.
[01:58:26.621 --> 01:58:29.023]  We're going to take some more calls and get into women in the military.
[01:58:29.063 --> 01:58:32.987]  And we'll come back and talk to Spencer and Mike and others.
[01:58:33.427 --> 01:58:35.308]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:35.328 --> 01:58:37.050]  Infowars.com is the website.
[01:58:37.110 --> 01:58:37.730]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:43.914 --> 01:58:47.395]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:58:47.655 --> 01:58:51.157]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:58:51.237 --> 01:58:55.198]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:58:55.418 --> 01:59:01.560]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:09.883]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:59:10.303 --> 01:59:10.743]  We're good to go.
[01:59:10.763 --> 01:59:11.244]  We're good to go.
[01:59:40.643 --> 01:59:42.023]  4438 Protect Your Family.
[01:59:50.325 --> 01:59:50.965]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.625 --> 01:59:52.665]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.385 --> 01:59:54.506]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.146 --> 01:59:55.966]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.746 --> 01:59:57.626]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.646 --> 02:00:01.967]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.467 --> 02:00:06.528]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.386 --> 02:00:14.588]  All right, folks, now breaking open another hour, third hour of this live show, the 11th of December, 2003.
[02:00:15.088 --> 02:00:18.290]  Alex Jones here is your host.
[02:00:18.850 --> 02:00:20.190]  We've got to Phyllis Shrapley.
[02:00:20.230 --> 02:00:35.596]  She is the founder of the Eagle Forum, best-selling author, been out there fighting the globalist and socialistic activities since the mid-1960s with her best-selling book, A Choice, Not an Echo.
[02:00:36.597 --> 02:00:46.224]  And we've been talking about Bush's for the assault weapons ban and cutting Taiwan loose and Governor Ridge saying we've got to find ways to legalize the illegals.
[02:00:46.284 --> 02:00:48.665]  And our listeners are saying they're mad at Bush.
[02:00:49.486 --> 02:00:52.068]  And then Bush says, well, what are you going to do, vote for Dean?
[02:00:52.988 --> 02:00:54.609]  And this is an interesting question.
[02:00:54.649 --> 02:00:56.651]  I'm sure all the callers are going to want to comment on this.
[02:00:57.561 --> 02:01:03.145]  You know, Phyllis has really studied how they're destroying our society through education to the courts.
[02:01:03.546 --> 02:01:08.369]  I want to talk about women in the military a little bit, too, coming up here in the next segment.
[02:01:08.389 --> 02:01:14.794]  She's got some interesting statistics I heard her talk about on the radio yesterday in her little vignette news report she does every day.
[02:01:15.755 --> 02:01:21.939]  Right now, let's go back to the calls for our guest, Spencer in Ohio.
[02:01:21.959 --> 02:01:22.520]  You're on the air.
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:22.940]  Go ahead.
[02:01:23.482 --> 02:01:24.443]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:01:24.703 --> 02:01:30.548]  Mrs. Schlafly, I thought Mr. Bush was going to ban the space-based weapons bill, but he has not yet.
[02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:38.656]  And I think we became a de facto justice system when Lee Harvey Oswald's right to due process was denied by television's first live murder.
[02:01:39.296 --> 02:01:48.385]  And going back to your book, or the involvement in the book, Kissinger on the Couch, the book talks about Oswald and his KGB handler, Boris Klausen.
[02:01:48.745 --> 02:01:49.926]  Do you know whatever happened to the
[02:01:50.405 --> 02:01:50.925]  Okay, that's all.
[02:01:51.045 --> 02:01:51.786]  Too many questions.
[02:01:51.806 --> 02:01:52.786]  I can't keep track of it.
[02:01:52.826 --> 02:01:54.307]  No, I'm not up on the history of Davy Crockett.
[02:01:54.347 --> 02:01:56.408]  I'm sure you know more about that than I do.
[02:02:17.250 --> 02:02:20.491]  I'm thrilled that you have a caller who's read Kissinger on the couch.
[02:02:20.711 --> 02:02:22.072]  You just have made my day.
[02:02:22.132 --> 02:02:33.236]  That's my 800-page opus about how Kissinger really betrayed us by the SALT agreements of 1972.
[02:02:34.277 --> 02:02:44.721]  And one of the great things that President Bush did was to repudiate the ABM Treaty, which was really Kissinger's handiwork.
[02:02:45.593 --> 02:02:53.594]  That's the ABM Treaty of 1972, and President Bush did withdraw from that, which is something that we've been working on for many years.
[02:02:54.555 --> 02:03:00.056]  I'm sorry, I've lost track of Clawson and whatever happened to Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:03:00.096 --> 02:03:03.116]  That's just kind of a little bit of ancient history at the moment.
[02:03:03.156 --> 02:03:04.176]  I've lost track of that.
[02:03:04.716 --> 02:03:06.357]  All right, Spencer, thanks for the call.
[02:03:06.837 --> 02:03:09.317]  Who's up next for our guests there, did you say?
[02:03:11.338 --> 02:03:13.558]  Mark in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:03:13.618 --> 02:03:13.978]  Go ahead.
[02:03:14.972 --> 02:03:15.992]  Hey, how are you guys doing?
[02:03:16.013 --> 02:03:17.153]  Fine, go ahead.
[02:03:17.993 --> 02:03:23.696]  I kind of don't like the way that you apologize for Republican administrations.
[02:03:23.756 --> 02:03:30.199]  I noticed that you said that Reagan was fooled when it came to Senator Dale Conner.
[02:03:31.019 --> 02:03:39.703]  That's funny because Howard Phillips said long beforehand that she's a pro-abort, and now Bush... Yes, and just before you go any farther, I will tell you...
[02:03:40.174 --> 02:03:45.918]  That I publicly opposed Sandra O'Connor's appointment at the time, just like Howard Phillips did.
[02:03:45.958 --> 02:03:54.523]  Now, Bush, are you aware that Miguel Estrada, by the way, is a pro-bort, running in front of the court briefs on behalf of the National Organization for Women Against Pro-Lifers?
[02:03:55.583 --> 02:03:56.504]  I have heard that, yes.
[02:03:56.524 --> 02:03:57.404]  All right.
[02:03:57.785 --> 02:04:00.046]  Now, you can't tell me Bush wasn't aware of that.
[02:04:00.066 --> 02:04:03.608]  Well, no, I'm not going to tell you that.
[02:04:03.708 --> 02:04:05.009]  What would be your excuse for that one?
[02:04:06.190 --> 02:04:08.111]  Well, he didn't hear me defending that.
[02:04:09.332 --> 02:04:09.692]  I don't know.
[02:04:10.925 --> 02:04:11.165]  Okay.
[02:04:12.266 --> 02:04:14.686]  I just noticed this spin that's put on.
[02:04:15.067 --> 02:04:17.648]  You know, if a Democrat does something, it's because they're a liberal.
[02:04:17.868 --> 02:04:19.668]  Well, Mike, I hear what you're saying.
[02:04:19.688 --> 02:04:21.049]  That's usually true.
[02:04:21.769 --> 02:04:22.569]  I mean, let me just say this.
[02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:26.411]  I don't hear Phyllis Schlafly spinning.
[02:04:26.611 --> 02:04:29.252]  Ann Coulter did spin, spun right on her face.
[02:04:30.072 --> 02:04:33.873]  When she got up here and said, the Patriot acts good, and I said, okay, what about this section?
[02:04:34.134 --> 02:04:35.154]  She says, I haven't read it.
[02:04:35.494 --> 02:04:38.015]  She writes a book about it, but she hasn't read it.
[02:04:38.715 --> 02:04:40.556]  And I have written the analysis on it.
[02:04:41.164 --> 02:04:42.525]  We'll be right back with Phyllis Schlafly.
[02:04:42.846 --> 02:04:44.808]  Stay with us.
[02:04:45.769 --> 02:04:50.113]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:50.313 --> 02:04:54.718]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:54.878 --> 02:04:59.242]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:04:59.302 --> 02:05:00.644]  The New World Order.
[02:05:01.404 --> 02:05:01.765]  Can emerge.
[02:05:02.426 --> 02:05:06.632]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:06.712 --> 02:05:13.642]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:13.782 --> 02:05:15.765]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:16.161 --> 02:05:26.466]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:26.766 --> 02:05:32.129]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:05:32.649 --> 02:05:35.270]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:05:35.410 --> 02:05:36.151]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:36.171 --> 02:05:36.651]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:36.711 --> 02:05:37.712]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:45.677 --> 02:05:49.238]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[02:05:49.558 --> 02:05:49.898]  Yes.
[02:05:50.178 --> 02:05:54.980]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[02:05:55.100 --> 02:06:04.042]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[02:06:04.182 --> 02:06:11.904]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[02:06:12.104 --> 02:06:14.285]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[02:06:14.525 --> 02:06:14.825]  I'm sorry.
[02:06:14.845 --> 02:06:15.085]  Go ahead.
[02:06:15.145 --> 02:06:15.846]  Powered in Missouri.
[02:06:16.026 --> 02:06:16.126]  Okay.
[02:06:16.226 --> 02:06:17.946]  Just give me the order you want to give me, too.
[02:06:18.006 --> 02:06:18.567]  Ian in Colorado.
[02:06:18.607 --> 02:06:18.847]  New Ian.
[02:06:46.175 --> 02:06:46.335]  Okay.
[02:06:46.355 --> 02:06:48.037]  Howard is... And he's in Michigan?
[02:06:48.077 --> 02:06:49.939]  Howard in Missouri, Jim in Michigan.
[02:06:49.979 --> 02:06:50.560]  We listened.
[02:07:11.987 --> 02:07:13.428]  Mike of New Hampshire's last name?
[02:07:13.448 --> 02:07:13.948]  Ian Colorado.
[02:07:13.968 --> 02:07:15.129]  We're going to him first.
[02:07:15.249 --> 02:07:17.450]  Howard in Missouri, Ian Colorado, Jim Michigan, Mike New Hampshire.
[02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:17.810]  That's it.
[02:07:17.850 --> 02:07:18.051]  Thanks.
[02:07:37.916 --> 02:07:40.897]  Toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:07:41.137 --> 02:07:43.797]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:07:50.439 --> 02:07:51.099]  Big Brother.
[02:07:51.759 --> 02:07:52.799]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:54.620]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:56.080]  You want answers?
[02:07:56.860 --> 02:07:57.760]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:57.780 --> 02:08:02.181]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.601 --> 02:08:04.942]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[02:08:05.848 --> 02:08:06.689]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:08.410 --> 02:08:09.371]  All right, my friends.
[02:08:09.391 --> 02:08:11.713]  It's our final segment with Phyllis Schlafly.
[02:08:11.793 --> 02:08:14.775]  And I'm going to get into a bunch of other key news in your calls.
[02:08:14.795 --> 02:08:20.760]  I'm going to try to jam three or four more calls in for our guests.
[02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:24.503]  Then I want her to have five minutes or so to talk about women in the military.
[02:08:24.563 --> 02:08:30.588]  It was her commentary yesterday that spurred me to get her on today about women in the military and Israel's own statistics on this.
[02:08:31.434 --> 02:08:38.980]  And, well, I have to add, the whole Private Lynch thing, the Pentagon tried to use that as a poster story for women in the military.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.602]  And, of course, it turned out to be a fable, as Jessica Lynch said.
[02:08:43.423 --> 02:08:45.885]  But, fellas, let's go right back to the calls.
[02:08:46.465 --> 02:08:52.049]  Up first is Howard in Missouri, then Ian, Colorado, Jim, Michigan, Mike, New Hampshire.
[02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.870]  That'll be it for calls.
[02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:56.313]  Let's go ahead and go to Howard in Missouri.
[02:08:56.353 --> 02:08:56.953]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:08:57.553 --> 02:08:58.114]  Yeah, um...
[02:08:58.587 --> 02:09:12.694]  Alex, I was reading in the Bible today about, in Isaiah 54, 13, and in 54, 17, it speaks about no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper.
[02:09:12.754 --> 02:09:22.579]  But before that, it talks about the smith that bloweth to, you know, the Lord said he created the smith that bloweth the coals and the fire.
[02:09:22.619 --> 02:09:22.799]  Okay.
[02:09:23.922 --> 02:09:29.286]  But, you know, in other words, they make the destruction, the influence of destruction.
[02:09:29.326 --> 02:09:29.987]  God made them.
[02:09:30.507 --> 02:09:38.454]  But also in 54.13 it says, And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of thy children.
[02:09:38.534 --> 02:09:45.900]  And I thought it was subject about Phyllis' comments about education, but we're not teaching the children of the Lord.
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:47.822]  And I just thought I'd give you that.
[02:09:47.882 --> 02:09:52.966]  Now, I just called the White House and told them about this, and I think the father...
[02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:54.770]  Okay, let me stop you, Howard.
[02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:55.850]  I appreciate your call.
[02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:56.951]  We'll get a comment from Phyllis.
[02:09:57.011 --> 02:10:01.252]  But first, Phyllis, did you see the big Washington Times article two weeks ago?
[02:10:19.367 --> 02:10:20.107]  About what?
[02:10:20.827 --> 02:10:28.869]  Where over two-thirds of administrators and college students, but administrators is what's really scary, don't know what the First Amendment is.
[02:10:29.049 --> 02:10:29.789]  Over two-thirds.
[02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:31.369]  Yes, yes, I did see that.
[02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:40.631]  Well, the colleges are notorious for putting in these speech codes and making everybody toe the line about political correctness.
[02:10:41.151 --> 02:10:44.132]  And the feminists are in very strong control on the media.
[02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:46.011]  They have no sense of humor.
[02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:52.696]  You can't exercise your freedom of speech to make a joke about anything that might possibly offend somebody.
[02:10:52.936 --> 02:10:58.920]  But Metra can say, kill white people, and Khalid Muhammad can say, kill all the white women, and that's not racist.
[02:10:58.980 --> 02:10:59.881]  No, that's different.
[02:11:00.341 --> 02:11:00.902]  That's different.
[02:11:01.742 --> 02:11:06.146]  And the colleges are really a disaster area.
[02:11:06.186 --> 02:11:11.410]  Did you see the polls that show that they're about left-wing to right-wing by a ratio of about 20 to 1?
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:18.761]  Yeah, I also saw the big study where the majority of them don't believe in the First Amendment.
[02:11:19.001 --> 02:11:21.522]  Once they're told what it is, they think it's a bad idea.
[02:11:21.742 --> 02:11:24.682]  Yeah, yeah, because that takes away their control.
[02:11:25.143 --> 02:11:31.464]  And these speech codes, there are even some colleges that have rules against making a joke.
[02:11:32.504 --> 02:11:35.645]  And they call you up before these harassment committees.
[02:11:36.406 --> 02:11:39.387]  And there have been some very unfair things that have happened.
[02:11:39.547 --> 02:11:44.848]  Yeah, they tell you, you apologize and go to this re-education class or we're going to take your degree from you.
[02:11:45.128 --> 02:11:46.169]  Right.
[02:11:46.549 --> 02:11:47.289]  It's amazing.
[02:11:47.669 --> 02:11:49.690]  Let's talk to Ian in Colorado.
[02:11:49.770 --> 02:11:50.470]  Ian, you're on the air.
[02:11:50.530 --> 02:11:50.950]  Go ahead.
[02:11:51.610 --> 02:11:52.270]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:11:52.491 --> 02:11:52.751]  Good.
[02:11:52.791 --> 02:11:53.211]  Go ahead.
[02:11:53.891 --> 02:12:03.774]  Hey, just to maybe make up for some colleges not being able to properly educate students, I want to let you know that I was...
[02:12:05.558 --> 02:12:10.479]  Offered the opportunity to take a course called New World Order at my college.
[02:12:11.099 --> 02:12:11.259]  Oh?
[02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:12.240]  Yeah.
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:13.400]  What did they teach?
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:17.461]  Essentially the same topics that you guys go over every day.
[02:12:18.321 --> 02:12:19.762]  Wow, what college is that?
[02:12:19.982 --> 02:12:22.202]  Well, are they for or against the New World Order?
[02:12:25.143 --> 02:12:29.524]  The professor who taught it, he definitely had a stance against it.
[02:12:30.414 --> 02:12:31.934]  But you didn't want to spin it too much.
[02:12:31.975 --> 02:12:36.636]  You wanted people to kind of really see it in its true form and make up their own minds.
[02:12:37.116 --> 02:12:39.397]  Mm-hmm.
[02:12:39.437 --> 02:12:39.697]  Yeah.
[02:12:39.737 --> 02:12:43.258]  Some of us are getting... Sir, what college is this?
[02:12:43.938 --> 02:12:46.518]  That was Metropolitan State College of Denver.
[02:12:46.879 --> 02:12:47.199]  Wow.
[02:12:47.759 --> 02:12:47.879]  Yep.
[02:12:48.359 --> 02:12:55.681]  Well, we're on the radio on two affiliates cover Denver, two 10,000 waters, so maybe folks want to go sign up for that course.
[02:12:56.388 --> 02:13:02.590]  Well, it was only just the one semester, unfortunately, and I was in there with a group of about 12 to 15 students.
[02:13:02.930 --> 02:13:05.291]  Oh, so it was like a special little class once.
[02:13:06.031 --> 02:13:08.012]  Yeah.
[02:13:08.112 --> 02:13:11.593]  I guess you'd call it an elective course, something along that line.
[02:13:11.873 --> 02:13:12.693]  It was excellent, though.
[02:13:12.713 --> 02:13:13.754]  I mean, I really enjoyed it.
[02:13:13.854 --> 02:13:15.554]  I had no knowledge of you, actually.
[02:13:15.574 --> 02:13:20.736]  I'd never even heard of you until probably like, I don't know, about three months ago, something like that.
[02:13:20.756 --> 02:13:21.036]  Yeah.
[02:13:22.116 --> 02:13:27.024]  When I listened to your show the first time, I realized that this is the exact same thing that I've been taught.
[02:13:28.005 --> 02:13:31.551]  He went back all the way to Hegel and talked the dialectic, the whole thing.
[02:13:33.263 --> 02:13:35.665]  It was an eye-opening thing.
[02:13:35.685 --> 02:13:44.273]  Well, I think if the students and the alumni start demanding courses on globalism to explain what its goals are, you wouldn't have to spin it.
[02:13:44.313 --> 02:13:49.098]  You could say what the globalists state, show their white papers, and most people would be against it.
[02:13:49.138 --> 02:13:50.899]  But, again, that's few and far between.
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:52.621]  Thanks for the call.
[02:13:53.181 --> 02:13:56.264]  I really do appreciate that call, Ian.
[02:13:56.304 --> 02:13:56.885]  Comments, fellas?
[02:13:58.214 --> 02:14:03.058]  Well, that's very surprising, what he said.
[02:14:03.078 --> 02:14:07.220]  That's not characteristic of most colleges, because most colleges are very left-wing.
[02:14:07.581 --> 02:14:12.624]  There are some students who go through college and never have a conservative professor at all.
[02:14:12.664 --> 02:14:18.928]  But see, there's been a backlash here, Phyllis, because Bush has energized globalist activity so much.
[02:14:19.308 --> 02:14:26.733]  Finally, I see a lot of leftists waking up, and in tune, wake up to their own party's corruption, because we've gotten past the partisanship.
[02:14:26.753 --> 02:14:27.354]  Mm-hmm.
[02:14:29.957 --> 02:14:46.084]  Well, I just hope we can educate the grassroots better, and I hope that when the young people go to college, they will join the support group, so they'll be able to exchange ideas with normal people and not just be sitting ducks for the brainwashing dished out by the left-wing professors.
[02:14:46.384 --> 02:14:47.625]  Now, you've written a lot of books.
[02:14:47.745 --> 02:14:49.426]  One of the newest is Feminist Fantasies.
[02:14:49.486 --> 02:14:54.168]  I've heard rave reviews of it explaining what feminism really does to the country.
[02:14:54.428 --> 02:14:54.869]  That's right.
[02:14:54.929 --> 02:14:57.810]  It tells you all you need to know about feminism but didn't know how to ask.
[02:14:58.459 --> 02:15:02.120]  And it covers how the feminists have put out their line in the media.
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:08.881]  It covers women in the military, women in the workforce, women in the home.
[02:15:09.422 --> 02:15:16.163]  It's just a very good handbook on what feminism is, which has been a very destructive movement.
[02:15:16.263 --> 02:15:20.524]  And it's really about getting control of women to get them under the government's control.
[02:15:20.544 --> 02:15:23.945]  I mean, even Gloria Steinem admits the CIA helped set up Ms.
[02:15:23.985 --> 02:15:24.465]  Magazine.
[02:15:26.417 --> 02:15:27.018]  Did you know that?
[02:15:27.338 --> 02:15:28.460]  No, I didn't know that.
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:29.701]  She admits that in one of her books.
[02:15:29.961 --> 02:15:30.863]  Uh-huh.
[02:15:31.043 --> 02:15:32.204]  I'm not kidding, Phyllis.
[02:15:32.545 --> 02:15:41.215]  Well, you can make a pretty good case for the fact that the reason they wanted to get all the wives in the workforce was to increase the revenues of the federal government.
[02:15:41.896 --> 02:15:45.420]  Because, you know, people aren't going to pay any higher taxes.
[02:15:46.139 --> 02:15:50.402]  But if you get all the wives in the workforce, that's a big windfall of money for the federal government.
[02:15:50.562 --> 02:15:54.664]  Well, Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[02:15:54.864 --> 02:15:55.785]  Yeah.
[02:15:55.865 --> 02:15:59.687]  So I urge people to go on my website, EagleForm.org.
[02:16:00.287 --> 02:16:03.789]  They can buy my book, Feminist Fantasies, which is a wonderful book.
[02:16:03.849 --> 02:16:06.311]  You really need it to understand the movement.
[02:16:07.031 --> 02:16:13.695]  And you can access all kinds of good information about immigration, about activist judges.
[02:16:13.835 --> 02:16:15.056]  What about a toll-free number?
[02:16:16.169 --> 02:16:17.010]  Toll-free number 1-800-726-8096.
[02:16:17.131 --> 02:16:17.491]  One more time.
[02:16:17.511 --> 02:16:17.571]  1-800-726-8096.
[02:16:25.566 --> 02:16:27.207]  8-0-9-6.
[02:16:27.767 --> 02:16:30.428]  Phyllis, I want to jam a couple more calls in here before we leave.
[02:16:30.448 --> 02:16:35.971]  But first, you gave a great three-minute vignette for your radio piece you do every day.
[02:16:35.991 --> 02:16:41.313]  I mean, how men, the Israelis own numbers, so they put women in combat.
[02:16:41.653 --> 02:16:43.794]  Women can do a 30-mile march.
[02:16:43.894 --> 02:16:45.555]  Men can do a 52-mile march.
[02:16:46.375 --> 02:16:49.777]  Men can pick up an average of about 45 pounds more than a woman.
[02:16:50.717 --> 02:16:58.240]  And there's a lot of statistics about... Yeah, there are tremendous physical differences between men and women.
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:05.583]  And one of the myths that the feminists have put out for years is that Israel uses women in combat, and it's just a lie.
[02:17:06.363 --> 02:17:08.844]  And they haven't done that.
[02:17:09.124 --> 02:17:19.368]  And this new report that just came out of Israel a couple of weeks ago, they did a new survey, a new study, and they found that the differences between men and women...
[02:17:19.841 --> 02:17:23.362]  Are just as great as ever, and they cannot use women in combat jobs.
[02:17:25.003 --> 02:17:28.845]  Well, there's also how men respond when a woman's blown in half.
[02:17:28.905 --> 02:17:31.225]  They respond differently to that than if a man's hit.
[02:17:31.446 --> 02:17:37.908]  Yeah, of course, the feminists want to send our men to sensitivity training, so that won't bother them.
[02:17:38.068 --> 02:17:45.551]  If the men say a bad word to them in the workplace by the water cooler, they want them banished to outer space somewhere.
[02:17:46.324 --> 02:17:52.566]  But then they claim if the enemy men rough them up, rape them, treat them badly, that's all right.
[02:17:52.606 --> 02:17:56.007]  That just shows women can be treated just like men.
[02:17:57.507 --> 02:17:59.968]  Maybe the troops can start wearing pink outfits, too.
[02:18:01.588 --> 02:18:02.849]  I don't know.
[02:18:02.909 --> 02:18:03.529]  It's just crazy.
[02:18:03.549 --> 02:18:10.391]  There's a lot of stuff women can do that men can't do, and this whole thing of saying that we're not different is just insane.
[02:18:10.551 --> 02:18:11.311]  It is insane.
[02:18:13.311 --> 02:18:16.054]  So I've got a lot of good material on feminism.
[02:18:16.134 --> 02:18:18.717]  I urge people to get my new book, Feminist Fantasy.
[02:18:18.837 --> 02:18:19.497]  It's really great.
[02:18:20.479 --> 02:18:20.859]  Absolutely.
[02:18:20.899 --> 02:18:21.359]  I haven't read it.
[02:18:21.399 --> 02:18:24.042]  I've read a couple of your books, though, and they were both excellent.
[02:18:24.082 --> 02:18:25.904]  But I would encourage you.
[02:18:26.265 --> 02:18:26.565]  All right.
[02:18:26.585 --> 02:18:28.207]  You can call toll-free at 1-800-726-8096.
[02:18:32.799 --> 02:18:35.540]  Or you can go on my website, EagleForum.org.
[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:35.780]  Yeah.
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:40.101]  Phyllis Schlafly, before we let you go, and folks, I'll come back with your calls, but she's got to go.
[02:18:40.961 --> 02:18:43.481]  Seriously, speak out against Bush.
[02:18:43.681 --> 02:18:49.103]  We need prominent conservative leaders to stand up to him, even if it means you won't get invited to the White House.
[02:18:49.743 --> 02:18:56.284]  And talk to Ann Coulter and tell her to stop saying the Patriot Act is a wonderful thing and you're a communist if you're against it.
[02:18:57.264 --> 02:19:00.585]  I mean, your own Eagle Forum has been out protesting the Patriot Act all over the country.
[02:19:01.218 --> 02:19:10.172]  Yes, well, we have to stand up for our civil liberties, and we have to have the government make a clear difference between the treatment of citizens and the treatment of aliens.
[02:19:10.433 --> 02:19:16.703]  Well, that's what we're saying, but Section 802 says that a misdemeanor is an act of terrorism by a citizen.
[02:19:17.754 --> 02:19:19.535]  And it's very frightening.
[02:19:19.835 --> 02:19:22.856]  All right, Phyllis Schlafly, the founder... All right, Alex, you have a good day.
[02:19:23.216 --> 02:19:23.536]  You bet.
[02:19:23.576 --> 02:19:24.317]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:19:24.897 --> 02:19:25.557]  I appreciate it.
[02:19:25.597 --> 02:19:27.258]  Phyllis Schlafly, the founder of the Eagle Forum.
[02:19:27.278 --> 02:19:27.798]  There she goes.
[02:19:28.298 --> 02:19:33.180]  Okay, Jenna Michigan, Micah New Hampshire and others, I promise we'll go right to you when we get back.
[02:19:33.901 --> 02:19:36.322]  And then just into all the other insane news.
[02:19:36.362 --> 02:19:39.463]  They're just taxed out, but it's all so important.
[02:19:40.303 --> 02:19:44.285]  So stay with us, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:46.922]  Hey, Doris, great news.
[02:19:47.162 --> 02:19:51.407]  I now own my own home, free and clear, and I did it in less than five months.
[02:19:51.527 --> 02:19:52.888]  Did you receive an inheritance?
[02:19:53.049 --> 02:19:53.529]  Well, no.
[02:19:53.689 --> 02:19:58.395]  Actually, I found a way to eliminate my mortgage without bankruptcy and without the need of going to court.
[02:19:58.515 --> 02:20:01.779]  And you, too, can do this legally, lawfully, ethically, and morally.
[02:20:01.859 --> 02:20:04.301]  But, Jim, I signed a note promising to pay back the loan.
[02:20:04.442 --> 02:20:06.424]  Isn't it wrong even if I could discharge the loan?
[02:20:06.664 --> 02:20:11.507]  Doris, I felt the same way until I took the time to learn the truth about money and banking.
[02:20:11.627 --> 02:20:15.510]  The most shocking thing I learned is the fact that no real money is ever loaned out.
[02:20:15.650 --> 02:20:18.332]  There's a dirty secret that the banks don't want you to know.
[02:20:18.512 --> 02:20:22.095]  And this is the basis of how I was able to discharge my own mortgage.
[02:20:22.275 --> 02:20:25.217]  I know this is hard to believe, but go to the website to learn more.
[02:20:25.357 --> 02:20:32.722]  Doris, get your pin and find out how many Americans are finding financial freedom by having their mortgages eliminated in less than five months.
[02:20:32.922 --> 02:20:37.546]  Go to www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[02:20:37.686 --> 02:20:40.107]  Just the way it sounds, and there's an S after mortgage.
[02:20:40.308 --> 02:20:44.971]  It's www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[02:20:45.486 --> 02:20:45.946]  Thank you.
[02:20:45.966 --> 02:20:46.387]  Thank you.
[02:20:46.407 --> 02:20:46.727]  Thank you.
[02:20:46.767 --> 02:20:47.047]  Thank you.
[02:21:15.486 --> 02:21:15.906]  We're good to go.
[02:21:46.960 --> 02:21:51.984]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[02:21:52.364 --> 02:21:55.106]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[02:21:55.567 --> 02:21:58.429]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[02:21:58.809 --> 02:22:05.955]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[02:22:06.475 --> 02:22:07.356]  That's recovery?
[02:22:07.976 --> 02:22:13.180]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[02:22:13.581 --> 02:22:15.122]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[02:22:15.796 --> 02:22:18.557]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.

[02:23:48.590 --> 02:23:54.615]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:23:55.216 --> 02:23:58.239]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:01.622 --> 02:24:03.663]  We're talking about the real world, folks.
[02:24:03.863 --> 02:24:09.408]  And I'm not going to sit here and attack Phyllis Schlafly because she's done a lot of good and exposed a lot of corruption.
[02:24:10.689 --> 02:24:13.332]  I mean, Ann Coulter would just say, Bush is good for...
[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:21.283]  You know, cutting loose Taiwan, Bush is good for open borders, the Patriot Act's good, gun control's good, you're a communist if you're not for it.
[02:24:21.303 --> 02:24:24.024]  I mean, she was actually saying stuff like that on the air.
[02:24:25.724 --> 02:24:29.546]  Whereas Phyllis would just go, oh, well, I don't know why, it's terrible.
[02:24:30.646 --> 02:24:32.067]  But the liberals are going to get us.
[02:24:32.427 --> 02:24:34.228]  Yeah, they have gotten us, that's right.
[02:24:34.268 --> 02:24:35.828]  They have gotten us for the big banks.
[02:24:36.769 --> 02:24:39.890]  Let's go to Jim and Mike and Ethan and Kevin and...
[02:24:41.192 --> 02:24:42.473]  Mark in Rhode Island and others.
[02:24:42.814 --> 02:24:44.475]  Go ahead, Jim in Michigan.
[02:24:44.495 --> 02:24:45.757]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:24:46.257 --> 02:24:51.502]  Yeah, I would have liked to talk to Phyllis, and I would have liked to ask her if she watched 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:24:51.822 --> 02:24:53.144]  Think she's ever watched your tape?
[02:24:54.185 --> 02:24:54.685]  I don't know.
[02:24:55.246 --> 02:24:59.750]  And also The Creature from Jekyll Island, where she read the book and the Bayside Prophecies.
[02:25:00.751 --> 02:25:01.952]  Give me 30 seconds here.
[02:25:01.972 --> 02:25:05.636]  I want to read you something about Volume 5 of the Bayside Prophecies.
[02:25:06.152 --> 02:25:06.873]  This is Jesus talking.
[02:25:36.292 --> 02:25:36.893]  Paganized.
[02:25:37.213 --> 02:25:38.595]  I sent you a lot of stuff on it.
[02:25:38.615 --> 02:25:39.956]  I don't think you had time to read it.
[02:25:40.497 --> 02:25:42.599]  No, I did get a lot of it, and thanks.
[02:25:42.699 --> 02:25:44.461]  She was telling everything.
[02:25:44.481 --> 02:25:46.043]  That's the only thing in the Catholic Church.
[02:25:47.044 --> 02:25:47.424]  Go ahead.
[02:25:48.045 --> 02:25:48.626]  God bless you.
[02:25:49.106 --> 02:25:51.048]  Hey, I appreciate the call, Jim.
[02:25:51.669 --> 02:25:53.190]  Let's talk to Mike in New Hampshire.
[02:25:53.231 --> 02:25:53.931]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:25:54.292 --> 02:25:55.032]  Yeah, hey, guy.
[02:25:55.353 --> 02:25:55.693]  Welcome.
[02:25:56.314 --> 02:25:57.275]  Well, live, read, die.
[02:25:58.635 --> 02:26:06.139]  There's a couple of men and a woman in South Carolina, I guess Monday, had a shootout with the police and killed two officers.
[02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:12.743]  They were trying to destroy part of their house to make a main road through their yard.
[02:26:13.444 --> 02:26:14.524]  And they put up a fight.
[02:26:14.705 --> 02:26:15.465]  You hear anything about it?
[02:26:16.045 --> 02:26:16.766]  Yes, I did.
[02:26:16.786 --> 02:26:18.006]  Okay, did you cover that?
[02:26:18.987 --> 02:26:21.468]  We did read a news article about it.
[02:26:22.029 --> 02:26:22.309]  Okay.
[02:26:22.549 --> 02:26:23.530]  Well, what do you think of it?
[02:26:23.970 --> 02:26:24.690]  What I think of it?
[02:26:25.071 --> 02:26:25.411]  Yes.
[02:26:26.031 --> 02:26:27.232]  Well, you know, the...
[02:26:29.028 --> 02:26:37.654]  The younger, I guess the man's son, Steve, in court, had said that the state he came from was a live-free-or-die state.
[02:26:39.015 --> 02:26:47.302]  And that if this is what his country's come to, then he'd just as soon die to live under tyranny.
[02:26:47.702 --> 02:26:49.463]  Now, where is the family right now?
[02:26:50.765 --> 02:26:52.706]  Well, the father got shot in the chest.
[02:26:52.726 --> 02:26:53.727]  He's still in the hospital.
[02:26:54.587 --> 02:26:57.570]  The son and mother have been apprehended in...
[02:26:58.143 --> 02:26:58.903]  You know, arrested.
[02:26:58.923 --> 02:27:03.946]  They're in jail waiting.
[02:27:04.046 --> 02:27:05.427]  How are the deputies doing?
[02:27:06.187 --> 02:27:06.827]  Well, I don't know.
[02:27:06.847 --> 02:27:18.193]  I had just read that two police officers had been killed while trying to take somebody's house, or not killed, injured, and one of them was in critical condition.
[02:27:18.253 --> 02:27:19.393]  I don't know what happened now.
[02:27:19.954 --> 02:27:21.334]  No, there's two dead sheriffs.
[02:27:22.275 --> 02:27:23.175]  Oh, so they are dead.
[02:27:23.215 --> 02:27:24.476]  Yeah, there's two of them, I guess.
[02:27:25.256 --> 02:27:25.896]  They're dead.
[02:27:28.676 --> 02:27:30.437]  I just wanted to make sure that you'd covered that.
[02:27:30.457 --> 02:27:42.186]  The reason why they did it was they feel that they should live free or die, and that's why they went ahead and defended their home and land.
[02:27:42.466 --> 02:27:45.789]  Well, speaking of Bush's lack of real conservatism...
[02:27:47.310 --> 02:27:53.512]  They're targeting Congressman Tom Tancredo, according to Human Events, to get him out of office because he's against open borders.
[02:27:53.852 --> 02:27:55.893]  He's a good Republican with a good voting record.
[02:27:56.333 --> 02:27:58.073]  They've targeted Ron Paul in the past.
[02:27:58.114 --> 02:27:59.434]  The Republicans have to get rid of him.
[02:27:59.714 --> 02:28:06.596]  They've successfully targeted Senator Bob Smith, who had the best voting record in the Senate, and put in their own creature.
[02:28:06.656 --> 02:28:14.239]  So, yet again, another example of the neocon treachery that the whores of talk radio keep their listeners in the dark about.
[02:28:14.339 --> 02:28:14.959]  Thanks for the call.
[02:28:15.583 --> 02:28:16.463]  Good to hear from you, Mike.
[02:28:17.464 --> 02:28:25.026]  Up next, I would guess, would be Ethan in Kentucky.
[02:28:25.066 --> 02:28:25.806]  You're on the air.
[02:28:25.846 --> 02:28:26.206]  Welcome.
[02:28:26.646 --> 02:28:27.146]  Hi, Alex.
[02:28:27.426 --> 02:28:28.126]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:28:28.326 --> 02:28:29.147]  You bet.
[02:28:29.627 --> 02:28:35.748]  One of the biggest things that I think should expose Bush that he's not a true conservative is that he's controlled by China.
[02:28:36.409 --> 02:28:37.849]  I think it's sickening and frightening.
[02:28:38.575 --> 02:28:44.379]  I think that this country, besides the United States, has the largest weapons of mass destruction program in the world.
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:47.962]  And all the reasons that we went after Iraq, China is a hundredfold.
[02:28:48.683 --> 02:28:54.327]  And you know they've been torturing Christians and pacifist Buddhists just for simply wanting to practice their religion.
[02:28:55.248 --> 02:28:59.131]  And we're going to go after Iraq because of those reasons?
[02:29:00.552 --> 02:29:05.636]  And it's clear that the Chinese intelligence has infiltrated North America.
[02:29:06.910 --> 02:29:10.571]  Vancouver is their largest base outside of China.
[02:29:12.351 --> 02:29:22.433]  And why would Bush not support a country like Taiwan who wants independence from this totalitarian dictatorship is because Bush isn't a conservative, he's a neo-fascist.
[02:29:23.754 --> 02:29:25.474]  I have to agree with you.
[02:29:25.534 --> 02:29:31.615]  He's also an anti-gun, anti-First Amendment, skull and bones, Luciferian, devil worshipper.
[02:29:32.255 --> 02:29:33.856]  Thanks for the call.
[02:29:33.936 --> 02:29:35.656]  We'll be back with news and then more calls.
[02:29:36.323 --> 02:29:37.224]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.704 --> 02:29:39.305]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.246 --> 02:29:43.048]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.151 --> 02:29:48.973]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:29:49.113 --> 02:29:49.933]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:29:50.074 --> 02:29:53.376]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:29:53.556 --> 02:29:59.221]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:29:59.361 --> 02:30:02.383]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:30:02.623 --> 02:30:06.904]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:30:07.084 --> 02:30:08.985]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[02:30:09.125 --> 02:30:16.187]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again, with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:30:16.367 --> 02:30:18.828]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:30:19.148 --> 02:30:21.810]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[02:30:21.970 --> 02:30:23.471]  Only this time it changed my life.
[02:30:23.751 --> 02:30:25.512]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[02:30:25.592 --> 02:30:27.713]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[02:30:27.873 --> 02:30:30.314]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[02:30:30.374 --> 02:30:33.076]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[02:30:33.276 --> 02:30:33.796]  Side effects?
[02:30:33.976 --> 02:30:36.238]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[02:30:36.398 --> 02:30:37.699]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[02:30:37.719 --> 02:30:37.919]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[02:30:37.939 --> 02:30:38.739]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:30:38.759 --> 02:30:39.660]  It worked for me.
[02:30:46.238 --> 02:30:49.479]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[02:31:08.647 --> 02:31:10.069]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[02:31:25.683 --> 02:31:26.503]  Do it now.
[02:31:26.744 --> 02:31:34.908]  That's $10 collector gold coins, 10 and $20 collector gold coins, at the nearest of melt in my 24 years in this business.
[02:31:34.988 --> 02:31:36.588]  Call Midas Resources, 800-686-2237.
[02:31:36.608 --> 02:31:37.189]  That's Midas at 800-686-2237.
[02:31:47.876 --> 02:31:48.336]  Hi, folks.
[02:31:48.376 --> 02:31:52.198]  This is Steve Crowley of the national Steve Crowley's American Scene Talk radio show.
[02:31:52.558 --> 02:31:55.119]  We are Money Talk, to be sure, 14 years of success.
[02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:57.599]  We're on every Monday through Friday from 9 a.m.
[02:31:57.619 --> 02:31:58.260]  to 11 a.m.
[02:31:58.360 --> 02:31:59.500]  Eastern and 6 a.m.
[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:00.160]  to 8 a.m.
[02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:02.261]  Pacific Time, Monday through Friday.
[02:32:02.561 --> 02:32:08.923]  We have big-name guests, the same ones you see on Drew Kaiser and CNBC, money-making topics, investor showcase, and much more.
[02:32:09.363 --> 02:32:13.805]  Coming up soon on the Genesis Communication Network, it's Steve Crowley's American Scene.
[02:32:15.029 --> 02:32:18.070]  Did you know there's a mixture that stops the aging process?
[02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:20.711]  Stops aging dead in its tracks?
[02:32:21.372 --> 02:32:22.712]  It's called drinking and driving.
[02:32:23.092 --> 02:32:24.093]  A lethal mixture.
[02:32:24.673 --> 02:32:25.933]  No one is immune to it.
[02:32:26.394 --> 02:32:31.316]  Each year, alcohol-related crashes kill more than 16,000 Americans.
[02:32:31.796 --> 02:32:37.858]  So if a friend of yours has been drinking and is about to drive, stop them before they kill someone.
[02:32:38.278 --> 02:32:44.581]  Brought to you in the public interest and as a public service by MAD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
[02:32:57.927 --> 02:33:03.651]  We've got about 26 minutes left coming up here in about 10 minutes or so after I get through some more of this important news.
[02:33:03.731 --> 02:33:09.635]  We'll go back to the phones on any of the different items we've covered today or any of the news I'm about to go back into.
[02:33:09.675 --> 02:33:11.556]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:11.576 --> 02:33:11.656]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:11.676 --> 02:33:13.357]  Ridge's immigration remarks draw fire.
[02:33:13.377 --> 02:33:15.219]  Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge's
[02:33:27.233 --> 02:33:37.679]  Expression of support for giving legal status to immigrants, that's illegal aliens, drew congressional criticism Wednesday, but heartened advocates.
[02:33:38.199 --> 02:33:51.426]  A town hall meeting in Miami, Ridge said the country needs to, quote, come to grips with the estimated 8 to 12 million illegal immigrants, try 30 million, quote, determine how you can legalize their presence.
[02:33:51.866 --> 02:33:52.567]  It's outrageous.
[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:58.122]  He also said during a visit to Florida on Tuesday that the immigrants should not be rewarded.
[02:33:58.402 --> 02:34:00.422]  Would citizenship just be legalized?
[02:34:00.642 --> 02:34:01.083]  Oh, yes.
[02:34:01.263 --> 02:34:02.203]  Super citizenship.
[02:34:02.223 --> 02:34:03.743]  None of the responsibilities.
[02:34:04.284 --> 02:34:12.746]  Asa Hutchins, Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security, said Wednesday in Miami that Ridge's comments simply reflected the debate in Congress on immigration.
[02:34:13.507 --> 02:34:14.247]  Yeah, right.
[02:34:15.347 --> 02:34:16.828]  What's this mean from Bush?
[02:34:17.048 --> 02:34:20.809]  President's rebuke of Taiwan stirs alarm.
[02:34:22.458 --> 02:34:24.320]  This is out of the LA Times.
[02:34:45.330 --> 02:34:54.854]  The only word I can use is appalled, said John Trekak, a China specialist at the Conservative Heritage Foundation and a staunch administration supporter.
[02:34:55.195 --> 02:35:06.340]  The spectacle of the American president, who just gave such an eloquent speech in Whitehall barely three weeks ago, saying the global expansion of democracy is a pillar of American foreign policy.
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:08.421]  Democracy, folks, we're a republic.
[02:35:08.841 --> 02:35:10.342]  His voice trailed off of disbelief.
[02:35:10.662 --> 02:35:13.043]  This just simply belies that.
[02:35:13.746 --> 02:35:16.668]  Behind the jarring imagery, however, was a simple message.
[02:35:17.068 --> 02:35:27.194]  The Bush administration believes that it cannot afford a political crisis that could draw the United States into a war over Taiwan while it has its hands full in Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea.
[02:35:27.975 --> 02:35:30.856]  Folks, I've said all along they're going to let China go into Taiwan.
[02:35:30.876 --> 02:35:31.917]  They've been arming China.
[02:35:32.137 --> 02:35:33.778]  They won't arm Taiwan.
[02:35:34.098 --> 02:35:42.203]  It's the same Clinton policy right out in the open, and you've got a liberal newspaper like the New York Times whitewashing it for Bush.
[02:35:42.243 --> 02:35:43.164]  The article goes on.
[02:35:44.545 --> 02:35:45.445]  We're good to go.
[02:35:45.466 --> 02:35:45.746]  I think?
[02:36:05.356 --> 02:36:12.439]  It's seven members of the nine-member Supreme Court appointed by Republicans, and neocons can make whatever excuses they want.
[02:36:12.979 --> 02:36:18.082]  The Supreme Court or Circuit Court appeals judge that Bush wanted to put in is pro-abort.
[02:36:18.902 --> 02:36:23.164]  Again, it's just total big government, total loss of sovereignty.
[02:36:24.474 --> 02:36:40.480]  Police state garbage all over the map, and the average person out there listening to the neocon liars on talk radio thinks that Bush is there fighting for them in America.
[02:36:41.354 --> 02:36:48.096]  When the whole war on terror is a smokescreen for the police state grabbing oil, bid-rigging, selling weapons.
[02:36:48.196 --> 02:36:50.956]  That's it, folks, while they go after your guns.
[02:36:51.016 --> 02:36:55.257]  Again, Bush is going to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.
[02:36:57.978 --> 02:37:00.979]  Did you guys find that Phyllis Schlafly report?
[02:37:01.059 --> 02:37:02.499]  Because I wanted to air that for folks.
[02:37:04.170 --> 02:37:05.491]  Yeah, let's go ahead and roll that.
[02:37:05.511 --> 02:37:07.793]  Then I'm going to get into some of this other news because I had her on.
[02:37:07.813 --> 02:37:10.495]  I meant to air this while she was on with us, but I forgot to.
[02:37:11.576 --> 02:37:12.917]  She makes some great points here.
[02:37:13.958 --> 02:37:19.922]  Then we'll go to some other news and then back to your calls.
[02:37:20.763 --> 02:37:22.364]  Again, folks, please stay with us.
[02:37:22.384 --> 02:37:27.388]  Here is that Phyllis Schlafly report that we air here on the network every day at 10 a.m.
[02:37:27.408 --> 02:37:27.749]  Here it is.
[02:37:28.930 --> 02:37:30.691]  This is the Phyllis Schlafly report.
[02:37:31.072 --> 02:37:43.878]  Mrs. Schlafly is a constitutional attorney, popular speaker, and the author of 20 books, including the new book, Feminist Fantasies, that reveals the feminist influence in the media, on college campuses, and right in your children's classrooms.
[02:37:43.898 --> 02:37:47.359]  And now here's the president of Eagle Forum, Phyllis Schlafly.
[02:37:47.979 --> 02:37:56.063]  For years, the feminists have been pushing to get women assigned to serve in military combat, arguing that Israel does this, so we should too.
[02:37:56.860 --> 02:38:10.828]  The Israeli military recently made clear by a public announcement that young women drafted into the Israeli military are barred from combat duties because a medical study has determined that they are, after all, the weaker sex.
[02:38:11.548 --> 02:38:20.233]  The study carried out by the Army Medical Corps found that women can carry only 40% of their body weight compared with 55% for men.
[02:38:20.853 --> 02:38:25.656]  Since military-age women, on average, weigh 33 pounds less than men...
[02:38:26.274 --> 02:38:30.296]  The average disparity in what they can lift is 44 pounds.
[02:38:30.896 --> 02:38:40.120]  The study also determined that men can be trained on marches of up to 55 miles, but women can be trained on marches of only 32 miles.
[02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:52.025]  The Israeli study, which was done at the request of the general staff, found that the amount of oxygen carrying hemoglobin in women's blood is 10% lower than in men's blood.
[02:38:52.554 --> 02:38:53.094]  We're good to go.
[02:38:53.114 --> 02:38:53.274]  I think?
[02:39:21.638 --> 02:39:31.621]  Germany, Canada, Denmark, and Norway allow women to serve in some combat roles, but those countries don't fight any wars and won't send troops to help us in Iraq.
[02:39:32.282 --> 02:39:50.608]  For years, the feminists have called for women to be assigned to military combat roles, but all surveys show that the majority of military women are strongly opposed to combat assignments, especially if it means being forced into combat on an equal basis with men.
[02:39:51.132 --> 02:39:53.713]  So there is a difference between men and women.
[02:39:54.594 --> 02:39:58.036]  This has been the Phyllis Schlafly Report, presented by Eagle Forum.
[02:39:58.076 --> 02:39:58.436]  All right.
[02:39:58.596 --> 02:40:00.557]  Leading America's pro-family movement since 1972.
[02:40:01.718 --> 02:40:06.901]  So, you know, Phyllis Schlafly does a lot of good work, and that's why I don't consider her a neocon.
[02:40:06.941 --> 02:40:15.946]  But I have seen her temper a lot of what she's doing since Bush became basically the new commie-fascist hybrid leader.
[02:40:16.006 --> 02:40:17.306]  But again, he's just a puppet.
[02:40:17.346 --> 02:40:18.367]  He's just a front man.
[02:40:19.770 --> 02:40:23.873]  British intelligence helped paramilitaries bomb North Ireland.
[02:40:24.554 --> 02:40:25.735]  That's out of the London Guardian.
[02:40:25.775 --> 02:40:27.817]  More news of government-sponsored terror.
[02:40:28.737 --> 02:40:32.620]  Al-Qaeda, that means CIA, plans great event in the new year.
[02:40:34.402 --> 02:40:36.524]  And more is coming up.
[02:40:36.684 --> 02:40:41.808]  Also, Arizona ranchers sued by civil rights group
[02:40:42.586 --> 02:40:53.634]  You mean Open Borders Group, a monastery official and a human rights advocacy group, sued a southern Arizona ranch family Wednesday, accusing them of impersonating federal agents and violating the rights of undocumented immigrants.
[02:40:54.054 --> 02:40:59.418]  So when they're on their own land, breaking and stealing things from them, they're going to sue them because they're trying to defend themselves.
[02:40:59.859 --> 02:41:02.741]  And more on Social Security checks could go south of the border.
[02:41:03.341 --> 02:41:06.163]  That's part of the new Pan-American Union.
[02:41:06.563 --> 02:41:07.704]  This and a lot more coming up.
[02:41:07.764 --> 02:41:09.826]  Right now, as promised, let's go back to the calls.
[02:41:10.166 --> 02:41:11.247]  Kevin in Mass.
[02:41:11.887 --> 02:41:13.608]  In Boston, Mass, you're on the air.
[02:41:13.648 --> 02:41:14.148]  Go ahead.
[02:41:15.028 --> 02:41:16.208]  Greetings, Alex.
[02:41:16.768 --> 02:41:24.331]  I trust your proven good judgment in striking the balance between respect for your guests on the show and hard-nosed journalism.
[02:41:25.011 --> 02:41:29.952]  I enjoy this little recording in the morning and listening to the show.
[02:41:30.372 --> 02:41:33.713]  But the question that I wanted to ask Ms.
[02:41:34.073 --> 02:41:36.734]  Shafley, it was the same question that I called,
[02:41:37.310 --> 02:41:50.190]  And asked Ann Coulter, and it's kind of a little bit repetitive with what that last caller said about, you know, how can she defend Mr. Bush, the alleged president, as, you know, to quote her as having done some good things
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:55.524]  When he attends Bohemian Grove and participates in the worship of occult deity Moloch.
[02:41:55.924 --> 02:42:00.347]  Oh, I was going to mention Bohemian Grove to her because she couldn't deny its existence.
[02:42:00.908 --> 02:42:02.409]  The Washington Times has written about it.
[02:42:02.449 --> 02:42:03.750]  David Gergen has talked about it.
[02:42:04.170 --> 02:42:06.312]  And yeah, how is that Christian or conservative?
[02:42:06.572 --> 02:42:10.034]  How is worshipping in a Shinto shrine summoning the demon?
[02:42:10.355 --> 02:42:11.656]  That's the Associated Press.
[02:42:12.216 --> 02:42:15.178]  How is worshipping Muslim stuff?
[02:42:15.879 --> 02:42:16.880]  It's disgusting.
[02:42:16.980 --> 02:42:17.260]  Bush...
[02:42:18.644 --> 02:42:21.786]  When he really goes and worships secretly is a Satanist.
[02:42:22.286 --> 02:42:25.988]  Now, that's Skull and Bones, that's Bohemian Grove, that's mainstream news, folks.
[02:42:26.168 --> 02:42:28.610]  But when he's out in the open, he's every other religion.
[02:42:29.710 --> 02:42:40.297]  You know, President Bush appointed Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe to be the head of the executive committee on the conference in U.S.
[02:42:40.377 --> 02:42:40.717]  mayors.
[02:42:41.277 --> 02:42:47.221]  And, you know, Mr. Ashe has had some very questionable things happen with some arrests.
[02:42:48.852 --> 02:42:51.175]  Well, that's what Sherman Skolnick has been saying.
[02:42:51.195 --> 02:42:54.658]  All I know is the Washington Times reported...
[02:43:11.839 --> 02:43:18.841]  I have an article from the mid-90s with David Gergen, where David Gergen admitted, yeah, I go to the Grove, yeah, I don't run around naked with all the other men.
[02:43:20.002 --> 02:43:26.164]  I've got Parade Magazine articles about the male prostitutes being shipped in, Spy Magazine articles, Sacramento Bee articles.
[02:43:26.224 --> 02:43:29.165]  It's all in Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:43:29.465 --> 02:43:32.066]  I snuck into the Grove, folks, three years ago.
[02:43:32.226 --> 02:43:33.366]  I got video out.
[02:43:33.786 --> 02:43:38.608]  The only and first video ever out of there, and it's in Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:43:39.088 --> 02:43:50.015]  And then Bohemian Grove member Harry Scherer, movie star and the voice of the Simpsons, he attacks me in a major motion picture called Teddy Bear's Picnic, making fun of me.
[02:43:50.435 --> 02:43:53.777]  I have Hollywood films made just attacking me, buddy.
[02:43:54.458 --> 02:44:03.984]  The key thing about the Grove, and I have that one, I have the Matrix Evil 9-1-1, but the Grove one was the, you know, I actually liked it better than 9-1-1, or the Tyranny, because
[02:44:04.537 --> 02:44:13.869]  You know, these people claim that they're going to create a utopia, and, well, yeah, we're doing all these bad things, but the end will justify the means, and trust us, we're smarter, and it's a hard world out there.
[02:44:14.290 --> 02:44:17.434]  But when you see that these people are truly Satanists,
[02:44:18.106 --> 02:44:20.267]  Then, you know, you have to stand up.
[02:44:20.427 --> 02:44:23.209]  And folks, that sounds nuts, but you've all heard of Skull and Bones.
[02:44:23.569 --> 02:44:24.829]  Most of you have heard of Bohemian Grove.
[02:44:24.849 --> 02:44:35.255]  The Bohemian Grove admits in the Trio Network documentary and the British documentary, they admit on national TV and the San Francisco Chronicle that I did shoot the video of their ritual.
[02:44:35.835 --> 02:44:36.475]  They admit it.
[02:44:36.595 --> 02:44:37.256]  They admit it.
[02:44:37.716 --> 02:44:38.496]  It's not debatable.
[02:44:38.556 --> 02:44:39.197]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:39.237 --> 02:44:39.537]  Thank you.
[02:44:39.957 --> 02:44:40.257]  You bet.
[02:44:40.297 --> 02:44:42.398]  It's just, oh, we're just having fun worshiping Satan.
[02:44:43.059 --> 02:44:44.780]  Mark in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:45.240]  Go ahead.
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:46.981]  Yeah, enjoying your show, and...
[02:44:47.748 --> 02:44:50.050]  Your passion and energy has inspired me
[02:45:11.440 --> 02:45:12.001]  We're good to go.
[02:45:41.852 --> 02:45:50.815]  Well, I know they're saying we're going to get nuked, smallpox will be released, but don't worry, just give up all your rights and you'll be just fine.
[02:45:51.235 --> 02:45:57.157]  Yeah, and I hope people will see our information at remnantofyhwh.com and look that up there.
[02:45:57.217 --> 02:45:59.218]  Behold, the white horse is the king of the north.
[02:45:59.238 --> 02:46:03.779]  You can click on the icon of King George II there in the upper right-hand corner.
[02:46:04.341 --> 02:46:11.486]  And get that document that we have, and we do pusher videos, and we support you 100% here on our website.
[02:46:11.686 --> 02:46:14.208]  Well, Mark, that sounds exciting to have more folks in the fight.
[02:46:14.248 --> 02:46:15.229]  What's your website again?
[02:46:15.349 --> 02:46:18.191]  It's remnantofyhwh.com.
[02:46:18.831 --> 02:46:20.092]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:46:20.652 --> 02:46:23.394]  Catherine in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:46:23.414 --> 02:46:23.874]  Go ahead.
[02:46:23.915 --> 02:46:24.215]  Welcome.
[02:46:24.975 --> 02:46:25.976]  Hi.
[02:46:26.216 --> 02:46:31.780]  Lots of things I could say, but have you seen this video CNN obtained?
[02:46:32.755 --> 02:46:36.779]  Of the kids in South Carolina, the police, the drug raid?
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:43.246]  Yeah, I had their lawyer on yesterday, the police dog biting the backpack.
[02:46:43.286 --> 02:46:44.487]  Oh my God, yes!
[02:46:45.594 --> 02:46:51.938]  The police dog biting the backpack, jumping on them, putting guns in their heads.
[02:46:52.018 --> 02:46:56.661]  More videos have been released, and yesterday morning I saw a new clip on CNN.
[02:46:57.181 --> 02:46:59.502]  I then got a call from a radio station going, where is it?
[02:46:59.582 --> 02:47:00.803]  I went back to the page.
[02:47:00.983 --> 02:47:03.545]  It was gone, but it's on television.
[02:47:03.685 --> 02:47:04.125]  I've seen it.
[02:47:04.205 --> 02:47:05.426]  I've seen the stills of it.
[02:47:05.946 --> 02:47:12.488]  If somebody could find where that video is again and email it to tips at infowars.com, we'll try to repost that.
[02:47:12.528 --> 02:47:14.969]  I don't mean the video that first came out two weeks ago.
[02:47:15.249 --> 02:47:20.490]  There's new video off the school surveillance tapes, and it's outrageous.
[02:47:21.150 --> 02:47:21.670]  Outrageous.
[02:47:22.411 --> 02:47:23.131]  Outrageous.
[02:47:23.191 --> 02:47:26.332]  If I was in high school, I would have been mortified.
[02:47:26.432 --> 02:47:27.592]  So you saw the video.
[02:47:27.612 --> 02:47:28.252]  What did you see?
[02:47:28.892 --> 02:47:32.913]  Oh, German Shepherds going after, they look like children.
[02:47:32.953 --> 02:47:34.814]  I don't know if it was a junior high or a high school.
[02:47:35.962 --> 02:47:37.944]  It was a high school, ages 13 to 17.
[02:47:38.244 --> 02:47:42.948]  They looked young, and they were backed up, and they were in the fetal position, these children.
[02:47:43.628 --> 02:47:46.211]  And the dog was grabbing the pack, savagely shaking it.
[02:47:46.691 --> 02:47:50.794]  Yes, and actually going after the children, but the policeman was holding them back.
[02:47:51.115 --> 02:47:53.857]  Yeah, all I've seen is on CNN online.
[02:47:54.197 --> 02:47:57.340]  If somebody would take that off the news and mail it to me, I'd be very thankful.
[02:47:58.436 --> 02:48:02.419]  But by the way, that violates their own law and their own policies.
[02:48:02.439 --> 02:48:07.802]  You're not supposed to have the backpack on the person while they're being searched because the dog will bite you.
[02:48:08.062 --> 02:48:12.105]  It's a Czechoslovakian dog trained in drug detection and attack.
[02:48:13.606 --> 02:48:14.666]  It's repugnant.
[02:48:14.726 --> 02:48:18.008]  So now Ann Coulter's been on the news saying, hey, it's a good thing.
[02:48:18.229 --> 02:48:19.690]  Let dogs jump on people.
[02:48:20.170 --> 02:48:21.511]  Let them put guns to kids' heads.
[02:48:21.711 --> 02:48:23.432]  You're a liberal if you're against it.
[02:48:24.062 --> 02:48:26.225]  No, I think it'll damage those kids for life.
[02:48:26.325 --> 02:48:27.406]  That's how bad I think it is.
[02:48:27.486 --> 02:48:31.531]  And I'm not saying... Well, we had their lawyer, Dwayne Green, on yesterday.
[02:48:31.551 --> 02:48:32.132]  He's suing them.
[02:48:33.053 --> 02:48:33.474]  They should.
[02:48:33.734 --> 02:48:34.094]  They should.
[02:48:35.556 --> 02:48:36.057]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:38.011]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:48:38.071 --> 02:48:38.931]  Yeah, hundreds of them.
[02:48:38.991 --> 02:48:41.053]  No drugs found, 107 children.
[02:48:41.493 --> 02:48:45.895]  No drugs found, and now there's reports that the military was involved.
[02:48:45.935 --> 02:48:48.257]  I mean, it's just, and I know they've been involved in other schools.
[02:48:48.857 --> 02:48:50.098]  We think there might be some drugs.
[02:48:50.118 --> 02:48:52.719]  We're going to put guns to all your heads and have dogs jump on you.
[02:48:52.939 --> 02:48:53.660]  How's that sound?
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:56.041]  And we're going to put cameras in the bathrooms now, too.
[02:48:56.081 --> 02:48:56.822]  We're a free country.
[02:48:57.542 --> 02:48:59.443]  Let's talk to Kenneth in South Carolina.
[02:48:59.483 --> 02:49:00.504]  Kenneth, you're on the air.
[02:49:00.744 --> 02:49:01.665]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:49:01.745 --> 02:49:03.225]  I wanted to have your opinion.
[02:49:04.166 --> 02:49:05.847]  Back when Jimmy Carter was president,
[02:49:06.365 --> 02:49:12.790]  We were running deficits of about 50 to $60 billion a year, but it was a high percentage of GDP.
[02:49:14.338 --> 02:49:18.742]  And now we're running deficits of about, I think next year it's going to be $500 billion.
[02:49:18.782 --> 02:49:19.443]  Is that accurate?
[02:49:19.723 --> 02:49:28.170]  Yeah, they tell you that there's no inflation or that it's at 3% with growth, but a car that costs $15,000 is now $30,000.
[02:49:28.951 --> 02:49:31.013]  A car that costs $30,000 is now $45,000.
[02:49:33.035 --> 02:49:34.956]  Look at the value in houses going up.
[02:49:35.237 --> 02:49:37.198]  So milk and eggs stay the same price.
[02:49:37.699 --> 02:49:39.460]  Healthcare, everything else goes up.
[02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:41.242]  Well, beef and eggs are very high now.
[02:49:41.826 --> 02:49:47.215]  But my point is, how long do you believe that we can sustain these kinds of deficits?
[02:49:47.275 --> 02:49:53.586]  And do you think it is possible to have a 1929 style depression in this country?
[02:49:55.311 --> 02:49:57.232]  An engineered collapse.
[02:49:57.573 --> 02:49:58.453]  29 was staged.
[02:49:58.513 --> 02:50:00.595]  That's admitted to consolidate.
[02:50:00.635 --> 02:50:01.996]  They create this debt bubble.
[02:50:02.056 --> 02:50:03.377]  It's impossible to pay off.
[02:50:03.717 --> 02:50:05.058]  So they can bankrupt things.
[02:50:05.078 --> 02:50:06.339]  They've done this in the third world.
[02:50:06.559 --> 02:50:10.962]  We have the IMF World Bank documents that Greg Powell's at the BBC got two years ago.
[02:50:11.042 --> 02:50:14.144]  That's in the interview section of InfoWars.com.
[02:50:14.544 --> 02:50:22.750]  The public plan released Joseph Sickles, their head economist, quit and went public to cause depressions to consolidate.
[02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:23.851]  Let me make one more quick point.
[02:50:24.071 --> 02:50:27.613]  Do you think it's possible to ever have 20-30% unemployment in this country?
[02:50:28.673 --> 02:50:33.595]  They say we already have 8% unemployment, but that's just the people that are showing the rolls.
[02:50:33.896 --> 02:50:34.956]  Real unemployment's at about 16%.
[02:50:35.096 --> 02:50:37.457]  It is very possible.
[02:50:38.758 --> 02:50:39.658]  It is probable.
[02:50:40.058 --> 02:50:41.679]  And they're telling you the economy's getting better.
[02:50:41.859 --> 02:50:43.420]  They're sucking you back in.
[02:50:46.121 --> 02:50:50.468]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.648 --> 02:50:55.075]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:55.235 --> 02:50:59.602]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:50:59.642 --> 02:51:00.984]  The New World Order.
[02:51:02.774 --> 02:51:06.999]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:07.059 --> 02:51:13.986]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:14.126 --> 02:51:16.128]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.522 --> 02:51:26.845]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:27.105 --> 02:51:32.466]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:51:45.663 --> 02:51:54.288]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:51:54.489 --> 02:52:05.775]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:52:05.996 --> 02:52:08.657]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:52:08.977 --> 02:52:13.080]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:52:13.220 --> 02:52:13.740]  We're good to go.
[02:52:36.510 --> 02:52:36.670]  803-4438.

[02:54:05.511 --> 02:54:10.733]  financial news services Market News International, giving it a firm put-hold on Wall Street.

[02:54:26.092 --> 02:54:26.632]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[02:54:26.792 --> 02:54:27.973]  Can you hear me all right?
[02:54:27.993 --> 02:54:28.293]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:46.045 --> 02:54:48.366]  I want to inject a little hope into this.
[02:54:49.086 --> 02:54:53.208]  Things can sound so down for people when they hear a lot of this stuff.
[02:54:53.488 --> 02:54:56.570]  Well, by being honest about how bad it is, we can hurt them.
[02:54:56.790 --> 02:55:00.731]  I'm not accusing you of anything negative.
[02:55:00.771 --> 02:55:13.497]  I'm just saying I would like to say that our hope is always supposed to be in the Lord and that He promises wrath to people that are going to try to gain righteousness by their own

[02:55:22.146 --> 02:55:24.427]  But I wanted to say a little bit more as well.
[02:55:24.928 --> 02:55:32.434]  A lot of what you're talking about that I know is true, and I've experienced myself the past few years, it caused me to do a lot of research.
[02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:41.094]  And I wanted to report a few things you said here through reading a few things, short things in the Declaration and the Constitution, if I could.
[02:55:41.294 --> 02:55:43.055]  Yeah, we're almost out of time, so go ahead.
[02:55:43.815 --> 02:55:58.542]  In the Declaration of Independence, the founders told us that in their list of redressed grievances that imposing taxes without their consent on the king's part was something that absolutely could not be done.
[02:55:58.842 --> 02:56:02.144]  And then the next thing they say is for depriving us in many cases of...
[02:56:03.482 --> 02:56:11.964]  Well, yeah.

[02:56:24.568 --> 02:56:25.068]  Absolutely.
[02:56:25.108 --> 02:56:29.030]  That's what I went through in the past couple years past.
[02:56:29.070 --> 02:56:33.332]  My children ran away from their mother after a divorce, and I was trying to get child testing.
[02:56:33.652 --> 02:56:37.054]  They ran away, and I subsequently got accused of a third-degree kidnapping charge.
[02:56:37.974 --> 02:56:42.456]  And I was just sucked her eye of money, is what it amounted to.
