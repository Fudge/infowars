[00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:07.353]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:15.579]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.280]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:19.161]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:20.602]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.363 --> 00:00:23.264]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:26.667]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.107 --> 00:00:31.170]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:47.089]  It's a big, big, powerful, important show today.
[00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.471]  It is the 31st of July, 2003.
[00:00:51.592 --> 00:00:52.853]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:54.514 --> 00:01:05.120]  And I rant and I rave and I analyze and I predict here on the show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central and then back from 9 to midnight.
[00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:07.342]  And I've been dropping the ball.
[00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:09.163]  I really have been dropping the ball.
[00:01:10.524 --> 00:01:12.245]  I'm not covering the news, folks.
[00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:14.486]  I have become desensitized.
[00:01:14.727 --> 00:01:16.928]  I have become conditioned.
[00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:20.650]  I haven't listened to my own warnings here on the show.
[00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:23.111]  And I've said it many times.
[00:01:23.892 --> 00:01:39.021]  If you don't consciously listen to this show with some key parameters in mind, this broadcast actually aids the New World Order, the Illuminati, the globalists.
[00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.207]  The Crime Syndicate.
[00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:54.373]  If you do not listen to this show with a couple of key understandings, several key parameters, you are actually aiding the New World Order.
[00:01:55.093 --> 00:01:57.694]  And that has happened to a certain degree in my own life here.
[00:01:58.975 --> 00:02:07.018]  It's gotten to the point now when major news stories come out about government kidnapping rings of children and women, I don't cover it anymore.
[00:02:07.178 --> 00:02:08.339]  I've been conditioned to it.
[00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:18.723]  When stories come out confirming what I warned you about six, seven years ago as they begin the satellite tracking and taxation, I don't cover it anymore.
[00:02:20.184 --> 00:02:26.349]  They have been spraying Oklahoma with multiple bacteria, gases, you name it.
[00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.333]  They're building level four bioweapons labs everywhere.
[00:02:31.353 --> 00:02:33.595]  They're putting new deadly stuff in the vaccines.
[00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:36.677]  The vaccine makers are losing lawsuits left and right.
[00:02:38.277 --> 00:02:42.099]  I haven't been covering it because I've been conditioned.
[00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:50.842]  Because I read about it 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago or covered it on the show, I don't cover the latest developments.
[00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:51.743]  I've been conditioned.
[00:02:52.403 --> 00:03:00.146]  And this show can serve as a conditioner, as an acclimator, if we're not conscious of this.
[00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:04.988]  This is very dangerous psychological warfare we're involved in here.
[00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.567]  I didn't mention it yesterday.
[00:03:35.863 --> 00:03:37.283]  It's wall-to-wall insanity.
[00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:38.704]  It's totally out of control.
[00:03:40.244 --> 00:03:42.905]  And there's really no way to track an onslaught of this level.
[00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:44.325]  We are living in total bedlam.
[00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:49.266]  The meter for insanity is close to pegging.
[00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:52.487]  And this is all being done by design.
[00:03:52.547 --> 00:03:56.207]  And it looks like the government's getting ready for a mass extermination operation.
[00:03:57.528 --> 00:03:58.848]  And it'll make the 20...
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.801]  We're good to go.
[00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:28.917]  It's all off the charts.
[00:04:29.077 --> 00:04:29.817]  It's massive.
[00:04:29.977 --> 00:04:30.538]  It's total.
[00:04:30.798 --> 00:04:35.660]  And I keep saying I'll do this, and I'm going to do a little bit better job of it.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.381]  I'm just going to try to read headlines.
[00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:41.563]  It'll probably take 30 minutes just to read today's headlines.
[00:04:41.663 --> 00:04:42.503]  Just the headlines.
[00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:46.025]  And I didn't get to half of yesterday's news.
[00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:51.047]  It's all totally insane, totally evil, out of control, off the charts, as I said.
[00:04:51.247 --> 00:04:54.788]  It's like I'm a radio operator in a...
[00:04:57.049 --> 00:05:01.136]  NORAD defense base with 100 nuclear bombs being dropped on it.
[00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.159]  There's no way to track all the missile trails.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.847]  We're under sustained shock and awe, pure evil attacks.
[00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:14.761]  Every cell of the body has a receptor site for our master hormone called growth hormone.
[00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:18.242]  The role of growth hormone is to instruct the cells to repair.
[00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:23.664]  This hormone is in the highest concentrations in the body between the ages of infancy and your early twenties.
[00:05:24.064 --> 00:05:27.465]  Hence, this is the major reason why the body repairs so well when young.
[00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:28.726]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.623 --> 00:05:56.412]  Deep sleep, improved mood, memory and energy, losses of body fat, improved strength and sex drive, reduction of joint pains, improved blood sugar, and more.
[00:05:56.673 --> 00:05:58.674]  Improve your chemistry and improve your life.
[00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:00.216]  Satisfaction guaranteed.
[00:06:00.336 --> 00:06:00.636]  Call 800-814-5031.
[00:06:00.656 --> 00:06:00.696]  800-814-5031.
[00:06:00.716 --> 00:06:00.756]  800-814-5031.
[00:06:10.385 --> 00:06:14.731]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:19.337]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:19.498 --> 00:06:23.864]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:23.924 --> 00:06:25.246]  The New World Order.
[00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:31.262]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:31.322 --> 00:06:38.250]  We rip the Senator-Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.392]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:40.913 --> 00:06:46.037]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:06:46.077 --> 00:06:48.539]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:49.239]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:49.719]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:50.720]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:09.774 --> 00:07:10.375]  Hello, folks.
[00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:11.355]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:07:11.735 --> 00:07:17.479]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:22.882]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:23.222 --> 00:07:30.907]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, fried halomethanes, radon,
[00:07:30.947 --> 00:07:31.127]  I think?
[00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:53.432]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:07:53.712 --> 00:08:02.780]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.123]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:08:07.023 --> 00:08:08.124]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:12.628]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:13.188 --> 00:08:15.991]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.653 --> 00:08:19.655]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:19.935 --> 00:08:26.045]  We are now eight minutes and ten seconds into the first hour of this live Thursday edition.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:36.562]  Let me just go over some of the headlines, and then we'll get into more detail on some of these top stories, and then, of course, start taking your calls.
[00:08:36.622 --> 00:08:38.302]  It's wide open phones at 800-259-9231.
[00:08:38.362 --> 00:08:41.223]  That's 800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:08:41.243 --> 00:08:43.844]  Congress zeroes in on Poindexter over terror futures flap.
[00:08:58.397 --> 00:09:00.738]  And this is out of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[00:09:01.638 --> 00:09:22.724]  You remember they announced that they were going to have what they called PAM, or this futures market run by the convicted felon Admiral Poindexter, thereby DARPA, your government mind control agency, the same folks that brought you the Total Information Awareness Network,
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.280]  We're good to go.
[00:09:47.802 --> 00:10:01.381]  This so happens it has the same amount of numbers as your Social Security number, and they say they want a biometric face scan or thumb scan to do it, and that's being put in at the state and federal level and at governmental levels all over the planet.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.261]  And it's unified.
[00:10:03.922 --> 00:10:07.725]  The plans were written over 10 years ago, have been public for about seven.
[00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:11.708]  They're planned for a worldwide tax and control grid on you and your family.
[00:10:12.228 --> 00:10:21.236]  So when you thumb scan to get that driver's license and you go to the grocery store and they want you to thumb scan, just remember, enjoy the global tax that you submitted to through ignorance.
[00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:25.079]  And remember, they put it in long before they announced it.
[00:10:26.169 --> 00:10:29.192]  Just like the satellite tracker boxes in all your cars.
[00:10:29.753 --> 00:10:31.855]  Biometric passports coming soon.
[00:10:31.895 --> 00:10:34.318]  This is from MSNBC.
[00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:38.382]  Countries scrambling to meet 04 deadline.
[00:10:38.582 --> 00:10:40.824]  Oh, countries have to have it.
[00:10:40.884 --> 00:10:42.066]  See, it's global.
[00:10:42.924 --> 00:10:48.526]  Well, travel to all corners of the globe, accessible by nearly everyone, tracking terrorists has become a daunting task.
[00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:58.289]  So image and document that contains personal data from a digital fingerprint or electronic artist scan, they're called biometric passports, and they may soon be a reality.
[00:10:58.989 --> 00:11:02.610]  Of course, since 93, they face scan and thumb scan in Texas.
[00:11:03.677 --> 00:11:06.838]  Now only eight states don't do it, and they're signing on to do it.
[00:11:07.178 --> 00:11:08.179]  It's an open U.N.
[00:11:08.219 --> 00:11:18.382]  plan, and you'll be taxed and traced, and you will be taxed when you eat fattening food, taxed when you buy beer or cigarettes, taxed when you drive down the road.
[00:11:19.142 --> 00:11:20.323]  This is their admitted plan.
[00:11:20.563 --> 00:11:26.865]  You will swipe your card for everything and be face scanned for everyone's security, but the borders will stay wide open.
[00:11:28.217 --> 00:11:33.818]  And I have mainstream news, official reports, about the satellite taxation beginning, okay?
[00:11:34.238 --> 00:11:36.759]  Again, you didn't want to be involved.
[00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:38.339]  You wanted to be a mindless yuppie.
[00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:41.400]  When I warned you about this years ago, you didn't want to be a leader.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:55.123]  And so now you're going to really enjoy living in your little one-room, compact city cesspool and having your pension funds taken and everything you've got taken while SWAT teams live in your old house.
[00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:01.453]  And you're going to learn how to lick boots, and you're going to thank the government for what they put on your little smart card.
[00:12:02.773 --> 00:12:09.457]  Okay, or you could get involved now, but I'm sure you won't, so don't worry, you'll be a minor official in the New World Order.
[00:12:11.158 --> 00:12:19.102]  Again, bombardment passports coming soon, and all the countries are being told they have to have them by the UN and Homeland Security.
[00:12:20.503 --> 00:12:25.786]  Okay, and if your country doesn't go along, they may be invaded by global forces.
[00:12:27.426 --> 00:12:28.107]  Here's another one.
[00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:30.849]  This is out of NBC News.
[00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.312]  Tracking chip concerns privacy advocates.
[00:12:35.113 --> 00:12:36.054]  Good for retailers.
[00:12:36.114 --> 00:12:37.795]  Questionable merit for consumers.
[00:12:37.855 --> 00:12:46.262]  And they admit that small trackable chips that are radio read off the towers on the road are going to go into all products and replace the barcode.
[00:12:46.303 --> 00:12:53.549]  And it did come out three weeks ago on this show, literally broken on this show by Caspian, the folks exposing all this, the organization.
[00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:55.402]  They got the documents.
[00:12:55.462 --> 00:12:56.142]  It's admitted now.
[00:12:56.182 --> 00:12:58.463]  It's been in the Wall Street Journal after we broke it on the show.
[00:12:59.443 --> 00:13:06.706]  That Homeland Security is working with Walmart and Target and others, and it is a giant cashless society tracking grid, of course.
[00:13:06.726 --> 00:13:08.427]  I'm sure you'll just submit to that.
[00:13:10.328 --> 00:13:16.551]  Also, the government talks a lot about bioweapons and how we're going to be hit by it any minute.
[00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:19.432]  And then we have the history of the U.S.
[00:13:19.472 --> 00:13:21.333]  government spraying almost every U.S.
[00:13:21.373 --> 00:13:23.574]  city with dangerous bacteria and viruses.
[00:13:24.489 --> 00:13:27.110]  With radioactive material, with chemical weapons.
[00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.511]  This is mainstream news.
[00:13:28.531 --> 00:13:29.972]  We've covered hundreds of articles here.
[00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:32.493]  They've sprayed Texas, Florida.
[00:13:33.493 --> 00:13:34.694]  They've sprayed New Zealand.
[00:13:34.714 --> 00:13:35.874]  They've sprayed London.
[00:13:35.914 --> 00:13:38.915]  They spray everybody in the Western world with all sorts of goodies.
[00:13:40.476 --> 00:13:51.941]  And now under BioShield, the six-plus-billion-dollar-a-year program Bush has launched, they're building dozens of bioweapons labs, level four, the Resident Evil-type stuff.
[00:13:53.042 --> 00:13:53.162]  And...
[00:13:55.745 --> 00:14:06.949]  They're going to build them in your big major cities, and the admitted plan is to prepare a bureaucracy for forced inoculations for dozens of bioweapons, so-called vaccines.
[00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:16.713]  So the people that launched the bioattacks are now going to make it a new giant industry to forcibly inject you, and they're building the giant bureaucracy to carry that out.
[00:14:17.413 --> 00:14:23.495]  And the Houston Chronicle reported they're preparing the national draft of doctors who have refused to take the shot
[00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:27.501]  And so they're going to draft him and make him take it and then force him to give it to you.
[00:14:27.541 --> 00:14:29.622]  This is the Houston Chronicle.
[00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:46.251]  The top epidemiologists and others at major universities have refused to take it, saying that there are unknown, bizarre compounds involved in the injection, DNA strands unknown, resembling bioweapons, but again, please take your injections.
[00:14:47.132 --> 00:14:53.475]  Just so happens that eugenics Nazis run the entire system, but again, we'll draft you and make you take it.
[00:14:54.162 --> 00:14:56.003]  And DARPA loves you, by the way.
[00:14:56.624 --> 00:15:00.346]  By the way, DARPA's announced their own drones to be deployed over all U.S.
[00:15:00.386 --> 00:15:00.767]  cities.
[00:15:01.387 --> 00:15:10.693]  Hover drones that can fly for 24 hours at a time, scanning your homes with ground-penetrating radar, feeding it back into Homeland Security Command Centers.
[00:15:11.434 --> 00:15:16.237]  Again, literal hell on earth, maximum tyranny being erected right now.
[00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:20.059]  And here's a story out of the Sunshine Project.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.081]  Loose Monkey teaches bio...
[00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:26.254]  Lab, a lesson on hazards of security.
[00:15:27.355 --> 00:15:32.619]  Biodefense accidents can spread some of the world's most infectious and lethal diseases.
[00:15:33.219 --> 00:15:42.005]  That's why they say they're going to produce thousands of gallons of smallpox, anthrax, and West Nile, worse stuff like Ebola.
[00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:44.307]  This has been announced in your neighborhood, in your big city.
[00:15:45.288 --> 00:15:48.690]  They're building bioweapons labs everywhere, building one around here in Austin.
[00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.831]  It's going to have all the
[00:15:50.703 --> 00:15:53.344]  All the gallons and gallons of the goodies.
[00:15:56.665 --> 00:16:06.209]  Biodefense accidents can spread and can spread some of the world's most infectious and lethal diseases as part of a $6 billion plus expansion of the U.S.
[00:16:06.229 --> 00:16:07.330]  biodefense program.
[00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:12.672]  More than three dozen new upgraded hot zones have been proposed across the country.
[00:16:14.267 --> 00:16:20.710]  Arms control experts and health and safety watchdog groups are deeply concerned that security at these labs will undermine U.S.
[00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:28.173]  compliance with the Bioweapons Convention, result in an accident and cover-ups, and obscure risks to surrounding communities.
[00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:33.756]  We have a government that purposely has sprayed stuff thousands of times on us, mainstream news.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.084]  It just came out that porting down in England into the 1980s would have U.S.
[00:16:39.144 --> 00:16:41.546]  and British troops sit in Jeeps and tanks.
[00:16:41.986 --> 00:16:44.509]  They'd fly over in helicopters and jets and spray them.
[00:16:45.229 --> 00:16:47.091]  Some of the men died on the spot.
[00:16:47.912 --> 00:16:49.653]  We're talking in the thousands.
[00:16:50.334 --> 00:16:52.215]  Oh, that's BBC and Associated Press.
[00:16:52.716 --> 00:16:57.139]  We have a government that orders troops to stand out in the sun and get sprayed.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.063]  Then they die and it's covered up and now it's admitted?
[00:17:02.879 --> 00:17:03.940]  In fact, I read that on air two weeks ago.
[00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:07.464]  And they're going to build these things all over the country, dozens of them.
[00:17:08.626 --> 00:17:19.518]  And at Porton Down, they released the foot and mouth that caused the slaughter of 4 million cows, 8 million sheep, to get control of the land.
[00:17:19.659 --> 00:17:22.462]  I predicted they wouldn't let them restock their animals, and of course they didn't.
[00:17:23.723 --> 00:17:25.164]  Just thought you'd want to know what they're building.
[00:17:25.684 --> 00:17:39.251]  Because of these concerns, in February, a group of non-profit watchdogs began sending a series of open letters to proposed biodefense labs, asking them to commit in writing the policies that prohibit all classified research and which ensure transparency of their operations.
[00:17:41.493 --> 00:17:53.019]  And it says Davis citizens were understandably angered when the story broke on Monday that a monkey had escaped from UCD's primate breeding facility, which rears animals for biodefense experiments.
[00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:56.362]  University officials have been hiding the story for 10 days.
[00:17:56.802 --> 00:18:03.885]  It took a whistleblower to leak the local newspaper before UCD decided to advise the community of the security breach.
[00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:11.328]  UCD says the rhesus monkey, which remains at large, is disease-free, but citizens are asking the obvious questions.
[00:18:11.728 --> 00:18:13.989]  Why did the UCD keep the escape secret?
[00:18:14.009 --> 00:18:17.010]  According to Joshua English, a community activist in Davis...
[00:18:17.836 --> 00:18:29.967]  When we found out the UCD officials suppressed the information regarding the escape monkey, the first thing I think came to everyone's mind was how open will they be when the escape monkey is infected with Ebola?
[00:18:32.109 --> 00:18:35.371]  Well, this is the type of stuff the government's going to do, folks.
[00:18:36.753 --> 00:18:39.055]  They're telling you there's going to be bio-releases.
[00:18:39.615 --> 00:18:41.177]  We're going to have to take your rights.
[00:18:41.957 --> 00:18:43.859]  We're going to have to put you in sports stadiums.
[00:18:44.099 --> 00:18:44.960]  It's going to happen.
[00:18:45.498 --> 00:18:47.700]  If we go to a red alert, you can't leave your house.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.641]  You'll, quote, be considered an enemy of the state.
[00:18:50.402 --> 00:18:52.744]  You go, well, why would they do something like that?
[00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:53.525]  I wouldn't.
[00:18:53.965 --> 00:18:59.970]  Well, you're not a ruthless, sadistic control freak controlling the levers of major power.
[00:19:01.691 --> 00:19:03.933]  You haven't read history and you don't know.
[00:19:04.774 --> 00:19:06.035]  You've never sought power.
[00:19:07.156 --> 00:19:08.577]  And you're not ruthless or cunning.
[00:19:09.378 --> 00:19:09.578]  So...
[00:19:10.347 --> 00:19:27.471]  You need to read history and wake up to how stupid and naive you've been and how you've endangered your family and this country by your mindless yuppie-ism, your hippie-ism, your neocon-ism, all your stupid establishment-isms.
[00:19:28.691 --> 00:19:35.013]  How many years have I told you that they were going to launch bio-attacks and terror attacks and herd us into compact cities and the attacks would get bigger and bigger?
[00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:37.770]  They were going to forcibly inject you.
[00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.230]  I've been reading their own plans.
[00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.150]  This is eugenics.
[00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.731]  This is the brave new world.
[00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:45.412]  Huxley said it was an actual government plan he'd seen.
[00:19:45.812 --> 00:19:47.593]  That's what brave new world comes out of.
[00:19:48.873 --> 00:19:51.734]  That's why it's all coming true, because it's a plan.
[00:19:55.715 --> 00:20:04.618]  Folks, the news I've got gets more and more insane, because next I'm going to cover how they're spraying the entire state of Oklahoma with deadly...
[00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:06.537]  Goodie.
[00:20:07.137 --> 00:20:07.758]  Be right back.
[00:20:12.402 --> 00:20:12.963]  It's here.
[00:20:13.223 --> 00:20:13.943]  It's powerful.
[00:20:14.224 --> 00:20:22.812]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.112 --> 00:20:24.974]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[00:20:25.234 --> 00:20:27.316]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[00:20:27.576 --> 00:20:31.800]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.781]  We're good to go.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.101]  Normally $279.

[00:23:09.308 --> 00:23:14.952]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:23:15.272 --> 00:23:16.133]  Probably never, right?
[00:23:16.413 --> 00:23:19.475]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.

[00:24:03.374 --> 00:24:06.217]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:24:12.828 --> 00:24:18.852]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:19.472 --> 00:24:22.474]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:26.296]  So let's get this straight.
[00:24:27.117 --> 00:24:28.398]  Let's make it clear.
[00:24:28.878 --> 00:24:34.842]  This government that's involved in all these terror attacks that admittedly sprays
[00:24:35.939 --> 00:24:36.439]  We're good to go.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:36.740]  I think?
[00:24:58.248 --> 00:25:05.871]  Then when the woman came into the emergency room at the base, you know, we would film the miscarriage and do tests on the dead baby.
[00:25:06.971 --> 00:25:10.132]  Now, this is stuff they commonly report 30 years after the factor.
[00:25:10.712 --> 00:25:13.953]  Yeah, 1985, we nerve-gassed a bunch of U.S.
[00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:15.374]  and British troops at Porton Down.
[00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:18.455]  We did it dozens of times going back into the 60s.
[00:25:18.495 --> 00:25:22.396]  We'd put biologicals on them and then see how the men died and...
[00:25:23.076 --> 00:25:30.138]  No, it's come out, but no one's going to be charged, because it was under orders with the Ministry of Defense and the Defense Department, the U.S.
[00:25:30.178 --> 00:25:30.959]  and British government.
[00:25:31.419 --> 00:25:37.101]  And yeah, we nerve-gassed some troops on ships as test, and most of them died within a few years.
[00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:38.201]  A few were still alive.
[00:25:39.725 --> 00:25:40.165]  Yeah.
[00:25:40.606 --> 00:25:46.230]  Oh, but by the way, now we're going to build big bioweapons labs all over the country, and they're level four.
[00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:53.094]  We're going to have Ebola and weaponized smallpox in them, and we're, quote, going to produce thousands of gallons of it.
[00:25:53.114 --> 00:25:54.495]  I have a Baltimore Sun article.
[00:25:54.815 --> 00:25:56.817]  Thousands of gallons.
[00:25:57.837 --> 00:26:02.841]  And it'll be right in the middle of your big cities, and it's going to be great.
[00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:07.564]  And now they're running bioweapons tests all over the country.
[00:26:07.624 --> 00:26:08.865]  I mean, look at this article.
[00:26:10.037 --> 00:26:11.098]  Look at this article here.
[00:26:12.978 --> 00:26:15.540]  I mean, there's just so many of these.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:26.725]  I've got articles here out of the Daily Oklahoman, out of the Associated Press, right off the Department of Defense's website where it goes, they're statewide, biggest bio and chemical test ever.
[00:26:27.545 --> 00:26:35.069]  We're spraying harmless materials, harmless gases and egg whites on you out of the helicopters and planes.
[00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:40.074]  And then, of course, we have the news reporter on from Daily Oklahoma, and I go, what are the other unnamed materials?
[00:26:40.474 --> 00:26:51.364]  Oh, Rassilis throngensis, just a bacteria, and we find out there's some other bacterias involved, and they just got their little helicopters out, little army helicopters.
[00:26:51.424 --> 00:26:57.169]  The paper reported they just so happened to be black, but, you know, if you criticize that, you're a little crazy, because...
[00:26:57.829 --> 00:27:00.912]  Even say you've seen those, even when they're on television, you're crazy, you know.
[00:27:01.172 --> 00:27:01.972]  It's doublethink.
[00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:09.738]  Big Brother tells you two plus two equals five, but if you say it equals five, Big Brother can execute you and say, well, no, it's really four.
[00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:14.181]  See, I'm beginning to learn the doublethink here.
[00:27:15.322 --> 00:27:19.225]  But, I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:27:19.325 --> 00:27:26.370]  We have a government that admittedly says, yeah, we had troops stand out in fields and on ships and we killed them and
[00:27:27.205 --> 00:27:28.705]  I mean, some of them died that day.
[00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:33.146]  Thousands of tests under Project Shad and others.
[00:27:34.027 --> 00:27:37.768]  And they had the forced sterilizations all over the country under eugenics.
[00:27:38.348 --> 00:27:43.989]  And we trust this government to wipe its own nose?
[00:27:45.089 --> 00:27:49.570]  And all the insider trading and the scams and the trillions.
[00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.771]  1.2 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[00:27:53.511 --> 00:27:55.692]  Trillions of dollars missing and...
[00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:03.335]  Giant prisons being built everywhere and police in ski masks pulling us over and demanding to search our cars.
[00:28:03.395 --> 00:28:05.216]  I mean, with the border wide open.
[00:28:05.296 --> 00:28:06.878]  What a sick joke!
[00:28:08.038 --> 00:28:12.522]  We've just been basting in this tyranny so long we can't even recognize it.
[00:28:14.003 --> 00:28:17.245]  They just haven't started all the mass arrests of those criticizing it.
[00:28:17.806 --> 00:28:19.567]  And they may not even need to because...
[00:28:20.737 --> 00:28:36.501]  You know, they've picked off a lot of patriots and done a lot of stuff, but the general public thinks that when the news announces, yeah, we're going to start tracking you and taxing you with satellite boxes that just so happen to have been built in your car that no one told you about.
[00:28:39.538 --> 00:28:43.521]  Oh, we're just now going to do this because the states don't have any money right now.
[00:28:43.761 --> 00:28:44.261]  Oh, yeah.
[00:28:44.721 --> 00:28:53.627]  They started with an unfunded mandate six years ago to tell all the car manufacturers to go ahead and put it in the cars, but now they're just now doing it for funding.
[00:28:54.007 --> 00:28:55.348]  They need funds.
[00:28:55.408 --> 00:28:56.688]  There's no money.
[00:28:57.429 --> 00:28:58.730]  And it just so happens the U.N.
[00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:06.094]  is mandating a global tax and part of your satellite tracker box tax in your car, turning your car into a mobile business.
[00:29:07.193 --> 00:29:09.334]  Taxi, a personal taxi.
[00:29:09.994 --> 00:29:12.515]  That's going to be going to the UN, but so what?
[00:29:12.555 --> 00:29:13.815]  That's not global government.
[00:29:14.095 --> 00:29:15.956]  Folks, I'm living in La La Land.
[00:29:18.696 --> 00:29:18.976]  I am.
[00:29:19.036 --> 00:29:20.137]  It's all off the charts.
[00:29:21.877 --> 00:29:22.698]  There's some good news.
[00:29:22.778 --> 00:29:27.619]  Planned sequel to Patriot Act losing audience out of the LA Times, but...
[00:29:28.251 --> 00:29:31.152]  And it's got Ashcroft admitting there's a Patriot Act 2 and saying we need it.
[00:29:31.532 --> 00:29:34.132]  But I got the guy on video saying there's no Patriot Act 2.
[00:29:34.392 --> 00:29:36.293]  You're aiding terrorists if you say there is.
[00:29:36.533 --> 00:29:45.175]  I mean, no one calls him on just lies that are so blatant it makes Bill Clinton look like the guy who wouldn't tell a lie chopping down the cherry tree.
[00:29:48.796 --> 00:29:53.237]  And I got articles here where the liberals are hailing the neocons going they're good Trotskyites.
[00:29:53.917 --> 00:29:57.338]  I mean, I'm living in some type of alternative dimension here.
[00:30:00.473 --> 00:30:01.413]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.874 --> 00:30:03.494]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.395 --> 00:30:07.196]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.557 --> 00:30:14.539]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[00:30:14.999 --> 00:30:21.241]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own purse on your own.
[00:30:21.261 --> 00:30:21.281]  803-4438.
[00:30:21.301 --> 00:30:22.442]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:30:42.839 --> 00:30:59.926]  I'm standing here watching an organized crime syndicate that has founded many of our institutions, that is generational in scope, admit in their own public papers
[00:31:00.837 --> 00:31:15.048]  They're building a giant prison grid for you and your family to break up your family, to dumb you down, to screen who can have children, to micromanage and forcibly drug you.
[00:31:16.369 --> 00:31:23.535]  I read hundreds of articles every year out of every major publication you can imagine, but always in the back.
[00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:35.981]  ...of the paper about, oh yeah, we sprayed you with a biological, it killed some people, but nothing's going to be done about it, as they flaunted in our face that we're nothing but chattel property.
[00:31:37.622 --> 00:31:49.692]  And then I read about how they're spraying our cities, and it's been going on now for three months in Oklahoma, the spraying that was first going to be in a few towns, but now they've said it's going statewide, and
[00:31:50.356 --> 00:31:50.636]  I think so.
[00:32:15.916 --> 00:32:16.917]  It's incredible, folks.
[00:32:16.957 --> 00:32:20.380]  They're just setting the precedence that, oh, that's what the government does.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.841]  They just fly over and spray us.
[00:32:23.963 --> 00:32:25.545]  We have all the mainstream news articles.
[00:32:25.585 --> 00:32:31.270]  We have the official press releases of the Pentagon on Infowars.com and Homeland Security.
[00:32:32.691 --> 00:32:34.433]  And yesterday, I never really covered this.
[00:32:34.493 --> 00:32:39.637]  It's out of the Ottawa newspaper, National Post.
[00:32:39.878 --> 00:32:42.320]  It's a national paper up there, and it says,
[00:32:43.223 --> 00:32:46.466]  Ottawa tries to rein in Joy Riders.
[00:32:47.006 --> 00:32:48.867]  Anti-theft advice required.
[00:32:48.887 --> 00:32:50.729]  Of course, I have a long-term memory.
[00:32:50.749 --> 00:32:58.935]  I have all the other National Post articles where the government's announced that the cars just so happen to have the satellite tracker box plug-ins already in them.
[00:33:00.157 --> 00:33:00.657]  We're good to go.
[00:33:00.697 --> 00:33:00.877]  I think?
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.521]  And then now they're selling it to you as anti-theft, see?
[00:33:26.761 --> 00:33:29.321]  Just like a USA Today on Monday.
[00:33:29.441 --> 00:33:30.222]  Remember that article?
[00:33:31.762 --> 00:33:33.082]  About, oh, the OnStar.
[00:33:33.102 --> 00:33:37.183]  And again, that's just the service where you pay to have them track and trace you.
[00:33:37.603 --> 00:33:43.645]  Oh, yeah, there's audio sensors and the government can listen to you and Homeland Security might use it, you know.
[00:33:44.105 --> 00:33:46.326]  Just check in on us with audio sensors.
[00:33:46.406 --> 00:33:50.107]  I mean, Big Brother checked in on Winston, you know.
[00:33:50.207 --> 00:33:51.407]  It's a sign of freedom.
[00:33:53.107 --> 00:33:55.329]  Ottawa tries to rein in joyriders.
[00:33:55.829 --> 00:33:57.770]  Anti-theft device required.
[00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:08.278]  See, now it's... And again, on Monday I read USA Today and I said, you see, it's going to be required because they're already making it required in Germany and England.
[00:34:08.678 --> 00:34:09.839]  They're moving to make it required.
[00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:11.080]  So the U.S.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.901]  is talking about making it required.
[00:34:12.961 --> 00:34:17.004]  The National Safety Transportation Department is...
[00:34:18.436 --> 00:34:21.778]  But here's Canada citing the death toll.
[00:34:21.938 --> 00:34:23.980]  See, they care about us.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:38.289]  Citing the death toll caused by young thrill-seekers and joyriders, Transportation Canada has introduced a regulation requiring that all new cars include an anti-theft immobilization device within two years.
[00:34:39.628 --> 00:34:48.694]  Automakers say the rule could force them to re-engineer some cars just for the small Canadian market, resulting in higher prices for consumers.
[00:34:49.395 --> 00:34:50.075]  Don't worry.
[00:34:50.776 --> 00:34:52.417]  This is a compartmentalized story.
[00:34:52.937 --> 00:35:02.884]  It's already been reported that most new car manufacturers, they say most, have the kill switch built into the new transmission.
[00:35:02.944 --> 00:35:07.087]  See, the transmission's got bigger and bigger in the last decade instead of smaller and smaller.
[00:35:07.587 --> 00:35:08.788]  And so companies...
[00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:09.934]  We're good to go.
[00:35:35.845 --> 00:35:40.726]  Again, it's all just mandated and you never hear about it until they tell you, hey, this is the new thing.
[00:35:40.766 --> 00:35:48.468]  When you show up at the DMV or show up at the grocery store or Home Depot, these self-serve checkout lanes are now having thumb scanners put in.
[00:35:48.828 --> 00:35:49.889]  And you just accept it.
[00:35:49.929 --> 00:35:52.429]  You don't want to be weird and lie and complain.
[00:35:53.329 --> 00:36:03.192]  And you certainly didn't want to listen to that Alex Jones in 1997 protesting it and getting arrested and holding up the executive orders.
[00:36:06.295 --> 00:36:13.238]  And as bizarre as it sounds, the executive order actually says DNA testing to buy your food or to get a driver's license.
[00:36:14.078 --> 00:36:15.939]  Yeah, it gets a little more crazy.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:26.063]  Oh, by the way, right here in Austin on Time Warner Cable, they have a little Army News Watch comes on, and I've told you a lot about this.
[00:36:26.103 --> 00:36:31.906]  A year ago they reported that all over the country, whether you have two employees or 100, call the Defense Department.
[00:36:32.326 --> 00:36:35.167]  They'll drop by and take urine or blood samples for employees.
[00:36:35.874 --> 00:36:45.062]  They suggest, as part of Homeland Security, that you require this of your employees to stop terror, because drugs fund terror.
[00:36:45.782 --> 00:36:54.669]  The Army would like to drop by, and yeah, Army News Lock said it could become mandatory, troops taking your fluids.
[00:36:56.951 --> 00:37:02.756]  I guess Jack T. Ripper and Dr. Strangelove wasn't so crazy after all.
[00:37:02.776 --> 00:37:05.118]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[00:37:06.678 --> 00:37:08.659]  Again, I'm living in Twilight Zone.
[00:37:09.139 --> 00:37:10.620]  And folks, there's masses of it.
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.560]  There's stacks of it.
[00:37:12.041 --> 00:37:15.082]  Why haven't you gone to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com?
[00:37:15.402 --> 00:37:17.463]  You need to go look at these articles right now.
[00:37:18.763 --> 00:37:25.046]  You need to sit there and spend a few hours a day and read all the horrible things they admit they're doing to you.
[00:37:25.446 --> 00:37:27.047]  But always for your best interest.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.663]  So, let me just finish this, and I'll go to John in Indiana and others.
[00:37:31.703 --> 00:37:34.525]  The toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:37:34.545 --> 00:37:41.531]  And maybe I'm spending too much time on how they're announcing they're going to start satellite tracking and taxing us.
[00:37:42.532 --> 00:37:43.553]  Now, four U.S.
[00:37:43.573 --> 00:37:44.533]  states are announcing it.
[00:37:45.574 --> 00:37:48.176]  Oregon was the first, and they admit it's a federal plan.
[00:37:49.738 --> 00:37:50.178]  Oh, boy.
[00:37:50.658 --> 00:37:56.023]  Ottawa tries to rein in joyriders, citing the death toll caused by young thrill-seekers.
[00:37:56.661 --> 00:38:03.747]  Joyriders Transport Canada has introduced a regulation requiring that all new cars include an anti-theft and mobilization device within two years.
[00:38:04.727 --> 00:38:10.452]  The systems are designed to make a vehicle impossible to drive when someone tries to start it without an encoded key.
[00:38:11.152 --> 00:38:14.495]  Studies show the equipment prevents theft in about 50% of cases.
[00:38:15.015 --> 00:38:19.599]  Transport Canada says the agency also says the system could have more than a dozen lives a year.
[00:38:22.913 --> 00:38:27.418]  It says, Transport Canada acknowledges 80% of light-duty vehicles already come equipped with the devices.
[00:38:28.198 --> 00:38:34.905]  The devices, the issue is the other 20% of cars, which tend to be cheaper models and not often targeted by economically motivated thieves.
[00:38:37.308 --> 00:38:38.449]  Let me explain, folks.
[00:38:39.108 --> 00:38:52.834]  The reports I have are that it's a kill switch already in the transmission that's satellite accessible or accessible by police helicopters that shoot a certain radio frequency.
[00:38:54.887 --> 00:38:55.087]  Mm-hmm.
[00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:25.513]  And, by the way, all over the country, they're burying these to knock out all cars with a general code.
[00:39:26.453 --> 00:39:37.138]  And if you look, when you go into major cities, they have cameras aimed right at your license plate, which they admit are hooked into the scanning system, and it face scans you as well, and they admit DARPA's running it.
[00:39:38.319 --> 00:39:41.641]  The Total Information Awareness Network has gotten massive funding.
[00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:42.881]  It did not have its funding cut.
[00:39:42.921 --> 00:39:44.342]  That was a false story in the press.
[00:39:44.642 --> 00:39:47.804]  They cut one area of the budget but increased its budget in other areas.
[00:39:49.006 --> 00:40:07.909]  By the way, I was back down at UT last night doing some shooting for a film I'm working on just because they've got some great background scenes, some great locations, and I'm there in a lab on perception in the psychology department.
[00:40:07.929 --> 00:40:13.850]  I look down, and there are DARPA documents all over the place, mind control, you name it.
[00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:14.991]  Of course, I got out of there.
[00:40:15.011 --> 00:40:16.731]  I'm not going to
[00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:19.596]  I'm going there and get around such things.
[00:40:19.616 --> 00:40:21.416]  I don't want to get near anything classified.
[00:40:21.436 --> 00:40:29.838]  I don't know if it was classified, but just your little mind control stuff there, just laying around in piles, just everywhere, DARPA taking over everywhere.
[00:40:29.858 --> 00:40:33.079]  No way to even try to ignore it if I wanted to.
[00:40:33.099 --> 00:40:37.260]  But that's Ottawa tries to rein in joyriders.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:41.921]  But here is Deutsche World Television, DWTV,
[00:40:43.058 --> 00:40:43.698]  We're good to go.
[00:40:43.718 --> 00:40:43.938]  I think?
[00:41:12.483 --> 00:41:17.128]  Now, that was the San Mato Times about a month ago, as well as Reuters.
[00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:19.350]  So, again, it is not the first to do it.
[00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:20.852]  But the control bridges...
[00:41:22.193 --> 00:41:28.535]  Are already in place and on board computers are being frantically installed in trucks throughout Germany and beyond.
[00:41:28.615 --> 00:41:40.778]  Trucking companies said traffic experts are carefully counting down the days until August 31st when trucks weighing more than 12 tons will be required to pay a per kilometer charge when they drive on Germany's autobahns.
[00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:42.679]  And of course, it's always the trucks first.
[00:41:42.939 --> 00:41:43.039]  Oh, 1930.
[00:41:44.219 --> 00:41:44.639]  We're good to go.
[00:42:11.628 --> 00:42:31.142]  Riding to the rescue is satellite technology which will work in tandem with small onboard computers installed in heavy trucks that function as drive-along toll station attendants registering how far the truck has driven along the toll road, calculating the cost, and sending it back to a central computer for later billing.
[00:42:32.303 --> 00:42:38.287]  Well, here in the U.S., they say, in the 1998 plan, the National Seat Belt Initiative...
[00:42:39.918 --> 00:42:40.739]  We're good to go.
[00:43:02.395 --> 00:43:13.543]  Guaranteed, after the next terror attack launched by the military-industrial complex, you're going to have to serve until you're 65 out there on the side of the road, one of the many duties, helping search the cars.
[00:43:14.083 --> 00:43:15.685]  Let's talk to John in Indiana.
[00:43:16.345 --> 00:43:18.467]  John, welcome to the brave new America.
[00:43:18.487 --> 00:43:23.530]  Well, Alex, I can add to, I think, a little dimension to what you're saying about all this globalization.
[00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:30.775]  Here in our Northwest Indiana Times, maybe you could put a link to it, your webmaster, for your readers.
[00:43:31.036 --> 00:43:31.396]  There's a
[00:43:33.044 --> 00:43:35.364]  A plant that's closing in Valparaiso, Indiana.
[00:43:36.365 --> 00:43:38.325]  They've already started the first and second rounds.
[00:43:38.865 --> 00:43:44.946]  But what's significant, of course, is the human compassion side of the story, is any plant closing.
[00:43:45.766 --> 00:43:50.647]  But in addition, the owner's plant, the place is called Magna Quench.
[00:43:51.407 --> 00:43:53.568]  The president, Archibald Cox, Jr.'
[00:43:53.548 --> 00:43:55.688]  's name, was cheered.
[00:43:57.928 --> 00:44:01.709]  The union organizer here, they had a rally for the displaced workers.
[00:44:02.631 --> 00:44:07.792]  This Valparaiso plant produces rare earth magnets used in the manufacturing of smart bombs.
[00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:12.093]  The firm's headquarters will be moved to Singapore early next year.
[00:44:12.393 --> 00:44:13.834]  Yeah, let me just break this down.
[00:44:13.854 --> 00:44:22.796]  There was a big story out of the Detroit Free Press where they're shutting down Mercedes-Benz plants and moving them to other places.
[00:44:23.376 --> 00:44:30.838]  The Mercedes-Benz plants are not closing in Alabama, are firing almost the entire American workforce and importing...
[00:44:32.393 --> 00:44:33.213]  I think so.
[00:44:54.443 --> 00:44:59.585]  Yeah, and the woman here, she said here she had six years and 40 days already.
[00:44:59.625 --> 00:45:02.606]  With one more day, she could have made another $125.
[00:45:03.346 --> 00:45:11.009]  Now it's likely she'll have to split up her family with herself and two of her sons staying in a friend's basement and the other two boys living with friends.
[00:45:11.548 --> 00:45:28.539]  And at the same time, the feds, the National Association of Counties and Cities, are passing unified zoning ordinances where you can't have people living in your basement, but if you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian and an American, they will come after you.
[00:45:28.599 --> 00:45:33.762]  But if it's a house full of illegals, swarming Russians, Mexicans, it doesn't matter.
[00:45:34.042 --> 00:45:35.363]  You're totally left alone.
[00:45:36.058 --> 00:45:41.845]  It's all perfectly and totally selectively enforced.
[00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:42.666]  This has been in the news.
[00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:55.100]  At 4th of July checkpoints, the police were federally paid for, and there were sheriffs in the news saying this, they were told by the feds, you stop vans full of illegal aliens, it's in the news, you let them go.
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.982]  We want middle class people.
[00:45:57.589 --> 00:46:09.617]  And so, here's the sheriff complaining, it was in an article in Ohio, that here he'd have a black or white family, their goods spread all over the road, he'd stop vans full of illegals, and he'd be ordered, let them go.
[00:46:10.477 --> 00:46:13.539]  So this is a wondrous news, and I saw it on the 4th.
[00:46:13.979 --> 00:46:24.205]  Families, you know, and their minivans pulled over, goods all over the roads, and the trucks full of illegals just driving with pure pleasure, Mexican trucks everywhere.
[00:46:24.226 --> 00:46:26.367]  Oh, it's all part of freedom.
[00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:31.470]  Yes, and you might have the FBI paying your lease or your mortgage or whatever that story you had on your tape, your video.
[00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:37.913]  Oh, where the hijackers had their houses, cars, and credit cards fully paid for, of course, by the FBI.
[00:46:37.933 --> 00:46:39.114]  All right, that's good work.
[00:46:39.134 --> 00:46:40.015]  I'll let your other callers do it.
[00:46:40.035 --> 00:46:40.795]  Well, no, no, hold on.
[00:46:41.315 --> 00:46:42.896]  Anything else you'd like to add, John?
[00:46:42.916 --> 00:46:47.539]  I mean, how dare you care if they're shutting down and moving to make the weapons in Singapore?
[00:46:48.459 --> 00:46:50.540]  Well, this is going to come back.
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:54.783]  I think even, what was it, Jefferson said that if we ever allow...
[00:46:55.669 --> 00:47:02.093]  Our country to be run by the outside force of the banking, the money that will be out on the future generations.
[00:47:02.473 --> 00:47:10.157]  The children of those that created the country will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers created.
[00:47:10.398 --> 00:47:12.359]  And they're sure doing a good job of that, aren't they?
[00:47:12.919 --> 00:47:14.540]  Well, hey, it's about slavery.
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:23.085]  See, these saps, these middle class, wannabe little neocon socialists, so evil and liberal, they don't even know they're liberal.
[00:47:24.188 --> 00:47:27.550]  They're the future man, let me tell you.
[00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.271]  Quacking their mindless idiocy.
[00:47:30.011 --> 00:47:31.632]  They think they're part of the establishment.
[00:47:31.652 --> 00:47:33.774]  They think Greenspan really cares about them.
[00:47:34.134 --> 00:47:36.375]  They think that they're part of the elite.
[00:47:36.675 --> 00:47:39.417]  They don't know they're slated to lose everything they've got.
[00:47:40.217 --> 00:47:48.802]  They don't know that the middle class of America and any American culture is to be destroyed and homogenized.
[00:47:49.429 --> 00:47:50.110]  And they love it.
[00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:52.412]  They love their political correctness.
[00:47:52.452 --> 00:47:53.874]  They love being lied to.
[00:47:54.094 --> 00:47:54.795]  Well, good.
[00:47:55.235 --> 00:47:55.555]  Good.
[00:47:55.595 --> 00:47:57.417]  They're going to watch it all destroyed.
[00:47:57.918 --> 00:48:02.743]  And while it's destroyed, they're going to beg and plead and love the government even more.
[00:48:04.945 --> 00:48:10.671]  The other thing that Archer Ball talks, I think, is he related to that during the White Watergate?
[00:48:11.734 --> 00:48:15.118]  Yes, if it's the same Archibald Cox, very loving individual.
[00:48:15.418 --> 00:48:17.541]  This junior, so I thought maybe that was significant too.
[00:48:17.581 --> 00:48:22.326]  Well, you've got Admiral Poindexter, the felon, running the Pentagon gambling scheme.
[00:48:22.406 --> 00:48:23.868]  Really, it's an insider trading scam.
[00:48:24.729 --> 00:48:26.591]  I mean, it's all about flaunting it.
[00:48:26.631 --> 00:48:29.314]  It's all about the mob bosses laughing at you, the little people.
[00:48:31.531 --> 00:48:35.614]  And we work with Medicare and Medicaid and even most private insurances to determine your maximum coverage benefits.
[00:49:00.254 --> 00:49:00.975]  We're good to go.
[00:49:22.134 --> 00:49:34.917]  800-419-2335 800-419-2335 800-419-2335 Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:49:35.177 --> 00:49:38.678]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:49:38.758 --> 00:49:42.719]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:49:42.919 --> 00:49:49.061]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:49.481 --> 00:49:50.122]  We're good to go.
[00:50:04.338 --> 00:50:04.558]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:50:04.578 --> 00:50:05.139]  Protect your family.
[00:50:30.111 --> 00:50:34.455]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:34.656 --> 00:50:39.080]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:43.604]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:43.624 --> 00:50:44.986]  The New World Order.
[00:50:46.767 --> 00:50:50.991]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:51.051 --> 00:50:57.978]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:50:58.118 --> 00:51:00.180]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:09.869]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery ring.
[00:51:09.949 --> 00:51:10.409]  We're good to go.
[00:51:41.319 --> 00:51:43.060]  All right, let's go to Ron in New York.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:44.460]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.220]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.020]  Hi, Alex.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:55.163]  It was funny what you mentioned a few minutes ago about illegal occupancy, multiple dwellings by illegal aliens.
[00:51:55.183 --> 00:51:59.604]  Of course, living here in New York, it is true because I see that all the time.
[00:52:00.164 --> 00:52:05.885]  You see houses like two family houses converted into multiple dwellings where you literally will have dozens.
[00:52:06.605 --> 00:52:08.026]  And I'm telling you, these are right near me.
[00:52:08.066 --> 00:52:08.986]  I see these places.
[00:52:09.568 --> 00:52:17.315]  ...of people who are illegal immigrants living in these small occupancies as obvious as a punch in the nose.
[00:52:17.716 --> 00:52:18.997]  And they do nothing about it.
[00:52:19.257 --> 00:52:27.325]  Hey, look, there's been articles all over the country that the local mob bosses that run the governments, and I mean small towns, big cities, they pass the ordinance...
[00:52:28.018 --> 00:52:40.323]  I mean, you'll have a cousin staying with you for a month while they're moving or something, and there's the police at your door, $1,000 fines, but you can have a house with boiling illegals coming out the front door and nothing will be done.
[00:52:40.343 --> 00:52:40.863]  Nothing is done.
[00:52:41.143 --> 00:52:41.604]  And you're right.
[00:52:41.704 --> 00:52:51.888]  And conversely, I have seen the enforcement people go to houses where maybe one solitary person lives, okay, quiet.
[00:52:51.908 --> 00:52:54.769]  You wouldn't even know the guy's there if you didn't know he was there.
[00:52:55.439 --> 00:52:57.640]  And they make a big issue out of it.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.721]  We've got to come in and inspect.
[00:53:00.541 --> 00:53:10.465]  Up in Illinois, it was in the Chicago Tribune that people wake up in bed at 7.30 in the morning with police and black ski masks with guns on them.
[00:53:10.505 --> 00:53:12.526]  This is in Aliceville and other areas up there.
[00:53:13.146 --> 00:53:16.788]  They say, we have to look and see how many toothbrushes you have.
[00:53:16.828 --> 00:53:21.850]  And if the house, privately owned, has three toothbrushes and there's only two people...
[00:53:23.379 --> 00:53:25.962]  That is an automatic find and arrest.
[00:53:26.042 --> 00:53:28.465]  Now, this was in the mainstream news in Illinois.
[00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:31.748]  Well, it's true because it's going on here in New York.
[00:53:31.828 --> 00:53:32.849]  I live in the city of New York.
[00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:37.094]  And the sick part about it is it is as blatant as the way you describe it.
[00:53:37.114 --> 00:53:40.778]  But you don't have a Fourth Amendment because it's just a little zoning issue.
[00:53:41.553 --> 00:53:46.537]  Well, if it's a zoning issue, then it should be applied equally to illegal aliens.
[00:53:46.697 --> 00:53:48.538]  I'm sorry, that's not going to happen, Ron.
[00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:51.520]  This is about destroying you and your family.
[00:53:51.881 --> 00:53:52.661]  They stated it.
[00:53:53.022 --> 00:53:54.342]  It's their plan.
[00:53:54.483 --> 00:54:04.410]  Didn't you hear UNESCO say that the job is to tax you so that both parents have to work so the kid turns into a little Ritalin gobbling psychopath?
[00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:06.231]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:54:06.351 --> 00:54:09.834]  All you have to do is have eyes and see it, and you could recognize it for yourself.
[00:54:10.345 --> 00:54:11.629]  And also, what happened with the president?
[00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:16.164]  I thought he wasn't... Everyone took responsibility for the misstatement in the...
[00:54:17.239 --> 00:54:18.660]  The State of the Union address.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:19.981]  Now, finally, he's done it.
[00:54:20.442 --> 00:54:20.962]  But hold on.
[00:54:21.122 --> 00:54:24.945]  Now you take responsibility, and nothing happens to you.
[00:54:25.306 --> 00:54:27.567]  You're learning double-think now, Ron.
[00:54:27.627 --> 00:54:30.910]  Now, what he's done is compounded his lie, because initially he denied it.
[00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:33.452]  He placed the blame on X. X took the blame.
[00:54:33.472 --> 00:54:34.433]  Then Y took the blame.
[00:54:34.453 --> 00:54:35.474]  Then Z took the blame.
[00:54:35.514 --> 00:54:36.294]  Hey, I tell you what.
[00:54:36.334 --> 00:54:37.836]  We need to talk about this issue.
[00:54:37.916 --> 00:54:38.396]  Stay there.
[00:54:38.436 --> 00:54:40.017]  And now he takes the blame two weeks later.
[00:54:40.037 --> 00:54:41.398]  Ron, I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:54:41.419 --> 00:54:41.859]  Hold over.
[00:54:42.318 --> 00:54:43.138]  We've got to end this hour.
[00:54:43.158 --> 00:54:44.299]  We'll come back and let you finish up.
[00:54:44.339 --> 00:54:46.000]  And then I'm getting the calls now.
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:46.900]  I had to cover the news.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.381]  And frankly, I haven't even covered 10% of it.
[00:54:49.441 --> 00:54:51.142]  More news, more information coming up.
[00:54:51.502 --> 00:54:52.082]  Second hour.
[00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:52.803]  And I'm angry.
[00:54:52.923 --> 00:54:53.503]  I'm upset.
[00:54:53.843 --> 00:54:55.164]  I'm sick of what's happening.
[00:54:55.484 --> 00:54:57.205]  I know tyranny when I see it, folks.
[00:54:57.285 --> 00:54:59.065]  And it's all around you.
[00:54:59.365 --> 00:55:04.968]  And you need to get tuned into the reality and stand up or things are going to get a lot worse a lot faster.
[00:55:06.423 --> 00:55:22.950]  Before I end this hour, I want to invite everybody to go to InfoWars.com and InfoWars.net and to get my videos, and to get my book, and to get them, and to make copies, and to give them to your friends, your family, your county commissioners, your local talk show hosts.
[00:55:23.391 --> 00:55:25.331]  Get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:25.832 --> 00:55:29.013]  It proves that the globalists carried out September 11th.
[00:55:30.133 --> 00:55:32.394]  Get Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror.
[00:55:32.615 --> 00:55:35.796]  Get my new film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:55:37.159 --> 00:55:38.580]  You need to get these videos.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.861]  You need to make copies of them.
[00:55:42.441 --> 00:55:44.962]  You need to get them out to your friends and family and educate them now.
[00:55:45.503 --> 00:55:51.445]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order the videos or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:58.448 --> 00:56:01.872]  These videos are waking up 90% of those that see them.
[00:56:02.313 --> 00:56:08.379]  It's up to you to get them, to get them out to people, and your purchase supports this show if you believe in liberty and freedom.
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:09.360]  Make the call.
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:09.521]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:09.801 --> 00:56:11.002]  Stop sitting on the fence.
[00:56:11.022 --> 00:56:12.704]  Get in the info war.
[00:56:12.744 --> 00:56:13.925]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:21.423 --> 00:56:24.928]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:56:25.168 --> 00:56:28.692]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:56:28.772 --> 00:56:32.777]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:56:37.023 --> 00:56:40.187]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.063 --> 00:56:47.704]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.364 --> 00:56:49.405]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.146 --> 00:56:51.247]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.907 --> 00:56:52.708]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.488 --> 00:56:54.389]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:58.773]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.233 --> 00:57:03.297]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:08.901 --> 00:57:11.303]  Alright, I'm going to your calls now, folks.
[00:57:11.524 --> 00:57:14.626]  So, if you want to get involved on air, here's your chance.
[00:57:14.786 --> 00:57:18.069]  Any of the issues I've talked about, you're welcome to join us on air.
[00:57:18.089 --> 00:57:31.441]  If you didn't get a chance to get in and talk about the Pentagon betting scheme, which is really more of an insider trading front, criminality right out in the open, and Admiral Poindexter, the convicted criminal, is in a lot of trouble over this.
[00:57:32.698 --> 00:57:56.137]  If you want to talk about how they're spraying almost the entire state of Oklahoma with chemicals and biologicals in your face, building bioweapons labs everywhere, if you want to talk about how the entire western world is moving to put in satellite tracker boxes that will be given to the state, local, federal, and international government, so a travel tax to force you into the buses...
[00:57:57.456 --> 00:58:10.042]  If you'd like to discuss any of these issues, or the lies of the war, or what the liberals are doing, or the conservatives, how they're all New World Order puppets, toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:58:11.123 --> 00:58:14.124]  We'll get right to your calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:58:14.204 --> 00:58:20.647]  And if you disagree with me, maybe you think gun control is conservative.
[00:58:20.767 --> 00:58:21.567]  I don't think it is.
[00:58:22.148 --> 00:58:23.949]  Maybe you think open borders is conservative.
[00:58:24.209 --> 00:58:24.789]  Maybe you think
[00:58:25.662 --> 00:58:26.983]  Checkpoints are conservative.
[00:58:27.003 --> 00:58:29.984]  Maybe you think that the end of America is good.
[00:58:30.184 --> 00:58:30.564]  I don't.
[00:58:30.644 --> 00:58:31.084]  I'm sorry.
[00:58:31.124 --> 00:58:31.705]  I'm a radical.
[00:58:32.085 --> 00:58:32.905]  I believe in freedom.
[00:58:32.965 --> 00:58:33.585]  I'm very evil.
[00:58:34.346 --> 00:58:42.309]  Ron, you were just mentioning Lord Bush, and he said, I take responsibility.
[00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:44.870]  A tenant said, I take responsibility.
[00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:47.291]  Well, if you took responsibility... Don't forget the speechwriter.
[00:58:47.371 --> 00:58:48.972]  He took responsibility earlier, too.
[00:58:49.831 --> 00:58:51.452]  Yeah, so everybody's taking responsibility.
[00:58:51.472 --> 00:59:03.839]  It's like taking responsibility for 9-1-1 so they all get raises and the people that blocked the good FBI agents, the high-level FBI agents, get record cash bonuses.
[00:59:04.539 --> 00:59:06.601]  How stupid can people be, okay?
[00:59:07.441 --> 00:59:09.682]  First he let Tenet fall on the sword for him.
[00:59:10.563 --> 00:59:12.044]  That was about three weeks ago.
[00:59:12.724 --> 00:59:16.026]  Then the speechwriter fell on the sword for him.
[00:59:16.963 --> 00:59:19.706]  That was maybe two weeks ago, a week and a half ago.
[00:59:20.486 --> 00:59:25.631]  And then he comes up to the plate, because the heat is so intense, I guess there's just no way to avoid it anymore.
[00:59:26.131 --> 00:59:27.613]  So he has to take responsibility.
[00:59:27.633 --> 00:59:29.835]  So what he has done is he's compounded his lie.
[00:59:30.535 --> 00:59:43.307]  Even if you were willing to turn a blind eye to the misstatement in the State of the Union speech, you can't, if you have common sense now, turn a blind eye to the fact that he's allowed a lie to get compounded and propagated over the period of a month.
[00:59:43.689 --> 00:59:46.351]  And now he comes forward and he finally takes responsibility for it.
[00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:58.461]  Well, by the way, everybody's just focusing... They're all focusing in on the 16 words about uranium, tons of uranium from Niger to Saddam, and he wants to build a bomb, or is building a bomb.
[00:59:59.021 --> 01:00:01.223]  They can hit us in 45 minutes.
[01:00:01.443 --> 01:00:03.365]  There's the mobile weapons trucks.
[01:00:04.045 --> 01:00:05.607]  There's the fake dossiers.
[01:00:06.648 --> 01:00:12.812]  And I heard Lord Limbaugh on the air the other day saying, oh, well, what about this meeting in...
[01:00:13.999 --> 01:00:16.941]  You know, in Czechoslovakia, that's been proven to be a lie.
[01:00:17.341 --> 01:00:20.924]  I hear Hannity saying, oh, what about the mass graves?
[01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:21.604]  That's admitted.
[01:00:21.824 --> 01:00:26.508]  I mean, they keep repeating the lies as the ultra-liberals that they are.
[01:00:27.128 --> 01:00:28.809]  As a matter of fact, you know, you mentioned Hannity.
[01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:32.912]  He said something on his TV show about two nights back.
[01:00:33.472 --> 01:00:35.614]  I found it really strange.
[01:00:35.814 --> 01:00:37.275]  I'm sorry, his radio show.
[01:00:37.927 --> 01:00:45.771]  In which people called and said, you know, well, listen, why doesn't the president give more information and have press conferences and be a little bit more forthright?
[01:00:46.332 --> 01:00:53.656]  And the excuse Hannity gave for the president was, well, listen, why should the president have to give any details or any more information?
[01:00:53.716 --> 01:00:56.197]  The press don't believe him anyway.
[01:00:57.018 --> 01:01:00.540]  So the president of the United States... Oh, yeah, they call it the liberal press.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:04.222]  The liberal press has been in a giant worship fast.
[01:01:05.276 --> 01:01:08.719]  Yeah, I would hardly say he's been getting a pass from the press.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.941]  That's my impression.
[01:01:12.063 --> 01:01:12.964]  Hello?
[01:01:13.084 --> 01:01:15.586]  Oh, so you're saying you think the press has been after him?
[01:01:15.927 --> 01:01:16.767]  No, no, no, no.
[01:01:16.808 --> 01:01:19.891]  I'm saying that he's actually probably gotten something of a pass.
[01:01:20.631 --> 01:01:26.157]  I know that I read the transcript of the press conference he gave, and it was the most softball stuff I ever heard.
[01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:35.835]  You know, but Hannity's philosophy is that why should the president have to account to the American people, you know, because after all, the president's not going to believe him.
[01:01:35.895 --> 01:01:36.516]  Exactly.
[01:01:36.556 --> 01:01:39.178]  I mean, did Stalin have to account to the Russian people?
[01:01:39.198 --> 01:01:40.139]  We'll be back with your calls.
[01:01:42.629 --> 01:01:51.254]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:01:51.474 --> 01:02:02.741]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:02:02.901 --> 01:02:05.602]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:02:05.963 --> 01:02:10.065]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:02:10.265 --> 01:02:12.406]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:02:12.566 --> 01:02:14.426]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:02:14.646 --> 01:02:20.668]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:26.570]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.244]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:08.110]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:12.952]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:03:13.092 --> 01:03:19.355]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:21.256]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:17.692]  Then go to any mainstream news site and really look at what's in the news stories.
[01:05:19.553 --> 01:05:22.534]  Cameras in the high school dressing room showers.
[01:05:23.394 --> 01:05:26.756]  Police running around in black ski masks with submachine guns.
[01:05:27.196 --> 01:05:28.937]  Face scanning cameras everywhere.
[01:05:29.537 --> 01:05:32.018]  Satellite tracker boxes going in the vehicles.
[01:05:33.208 --> 01:05:36.190]  Troops invading all these sovereign countries.
[01:05:37.711 --> 01:05:41.134]  Endless lies and propaganda out of Washington.
[01:05:41.674 --> 01:05:45.557]  The government force drugging millions of children with Ritalin and Prozac.
[01:05:46.698 --> 01:05:51.941]  Shipping the other narcotics in and using that crisis as an excuse to crack down on the people.
[01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:53.723]  It's a joke!
[01:05:55.784 --> 01:05:58.366]  We're living in a police state, folks!
[01:05:59.378 --> 01:06:01.440]  And it just randomly feeds on people.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.142]  It feeds on its own, those that serve the system.
[01:06:04.202 --> 01:06:06.323]  It feeds on those that fight the system.
[01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:24.417]  It just goes around a giant criminal enterprise expanding its size and scope and funding and always in the name of protecting us because it's so good and so trustworthy when it's really just a system made up of power-hungry sadists
[01:06:24.637 --> 01:06:26.837]  Let's talk to Justin in Minnesota, then Roy, Lucinda, and others.
[01:06:26.897 --> 01:06:27.658]  Justin, you're on the air.
[01:06:27.678 --> 01:06:28.058]  Go ahead.
[01:06:28.078 --> 01:06:28.638]  Hi, Alex.
[01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:54.632]  I had just a couple questions I wanted to ask you.
[01:06:56.633 --> 01:06:59.274]  Maybe it's another thing that you could put up on your website.
[01:06:59.694 --> 01:07:06.218]  Maybe just like a top five or ten influential NWO members.
[01:07:07.278 --> 01:07:14.942]  A list of the prison camps that you're talking about is the ones that are supposedly already built.
[01:07:14.962 --> 01:07:20.605]  I wonder if you could put anything like that out there for me to do some more research on.
[01:07:21.684 --> 01:07:27.367]  Well, now, we do have a concentration camp section on prisonplanet.com.
[01:07:27.387 --> 01:07:28.107]  Have you been to it?
[01:07:28.527 --> 01:07:29.108]  Yes, I have.
[01:07:29.608 --> 01:07:35.271]  Okay, well, I mean, there's Detroit Free Press saying, quote, our troops are trained to kill grandmothers.
[01:07:36.311 --> 01:07:42.034]  We have the Rocky Mountain News saying mass graves and incinerators are ready for you and your family.
[01:07:42.054 --> 01:07:43.375]  It actually says that.
[01:07:44.585 --> 01:07:52.587]  We have the LA Times, Ashcroft's Hellish Camps, camps being built, execution centers for anyone committing a misdemeanor.
[01:07:53.507 --> 01:08:01.389]  We have the East Coast, West Coast TV stations reporting with county commissioners announcing.
[01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:09.251]  Dave Schultz, one of them, we had on the show about how the feds told him about how they wanted to use the national park as a mass camp for hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:08:10.078 --> 01:08:12.820]  They're reopening Manazar and the Japanese camps.
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:13.521]  That's admitted.
[01:08:13.581 --> 01:08:18.064]  We've been there and gotten photos and written articles about it five, six, seven years ago.
[01:08:21.787 --> 01:08:24.989]  The camps, we've got more prisons than any other country in the world.
[01:08:25.330 --> 01:08:31.995]  The camps are your giant new county jails and law enforcement centers and FEMA emergency centers.
[01:08:32.055 --> 01:08:34.837]  I mean, right here in Austin, the old Robert Mueller Airport.
[01:08:36.421 --> 01:08:37.161]  800 acres.
[01:08:37.341 --> 01:08:38.822]  Part of it's a movie studio.
[01:08:38.862 --> 01:08:52.871]  The other part is jet hangers with bolts and chains in the floor, thousands of cots, porta-potties, barbed wire inside, and places to chain people up with armored vehicles parked.
[01:08:53.031 --> 01:08:59.395]  And then they announce on the local news, this is a camp for your safety, and Austin wins the FEMA 2000 award.
[01:08:59.415 --> 01:09:01.897]  This is before 9-1-1, and they're building some
[01:09:02.197 --> 01:09:03.218]  We're good to go.
[01:09:03.298 --> 01:09:03.838]  We're good to go.
[01:09:31.798 --> 01:09:32.338]  Where was that?
[01:09:32.599 --> 01:09:32.879]  Newsmax.
[01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:33.879]  It's on the site.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.341]  We got links to all this on Infowars.
[01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:39.102]  And he said, it's a public federal purchase order.
[01:10:02.558 --> 01:10:20.025]  Sir, in 1999, we have footage from Hebron, Maryland, from Oakland, California, from South Texas, as Army, as Marines, as Dutch Marines, as British Marines, as Israeli troops.
[01:10:21.368 --> 01:10:35.056]  That Australians and Germans train admittedly with role players screaming, I'm an American, please, I have rights, no, no, no, not the camp.
[01:10:36.197 --> 01:10:50.165]  I have footage of Marines on a tour saying you're going to get a chance to watch an execution as they put a guy down on his hands and knees and simulate blowing his head off.
[01:10:50.885 --> 01:10:51.325]  Go ahead.
[01:10:51.345 --> 01:10:51.866]  Anything else?
[01:10:52.226 --> 01:10:56.650]  Well, I was wondering, do you know where they quarter some of these foreign troops?
[01:10:58.051 --> 01:11:09.021]  Oh, man, here in Austin, if you see about half the time a bus stops and it's got troops on it, they'll be Chinese, Mexican, Czech Republic.
[01:11:09.761 --> 01:11:11.302]  Still off low, their little U.N.
[01:11:11.342 --> 01:11:11.842]  badges.
[01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:15.065]  Sacramento Bay reported last year a giant U.N.
[01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:18.727]  operation from Northern California to Nevada with armored U.N.
[01:11:18.767 --> 01:11:21.729]  vehicles and helicopters and a practice shutdown of the states.
[01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:24.351]  I mean, it's just wall to wall, sir.
[01:11:24.371 --> 01:11:25.091]  Wow.
[01:11:25.231 --> 01:11:26.372]  Wall to wall.
[01:11:26.832 --> 01:11:29.894]  Just to wrap this up, I'll let you get out of the next... Well, what were your other questions?
[01:11:30.135 --> 01:11:36.779]  Because you brought up that question, and then I went off into a... Well, I wanted to get back to maybe a top five or ten...
[01:11:39.011 --> 01:11:39.291]  Yeah.
[01:11:39.311 --> 01:11:39.491]  Right.
[01:11:39.531 --> 01:11:39.671]  Yeah.
[01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:13.111]  It is the Dutch Roll family, British Roll family, the Rothschild Banking family in this country, the Rockefeller Banking family.
[01:12:14.326 --> 01:12:19.969]  There's a few other families involved in it, but that's the top five.
[01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:22.771]  And they own your media.
[01:12:22.811 --> 01:12:24.072]  They own your weapons firms.
[01:12:24.112 --> 01:12:26.733]  They own your plastics manufacturing plants.
[01:12:26.753 --> 01:12:27.954]  They own your oil companies.
[01:12:28.314 --> 01:12:32.496]  They own your private Federal Reserve and IMF and World Bank, which is private shareholders.
[01:12:32.936 --> 01:12:34.197]  They own the money machines.
[01:12:34.257 --> 01:12:35.558]  They print the money, folks.
[01:12:36.058 --> 01:12:38.659]  Bill Gates is a pauper compared to these people.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.982]  And they're so powerful and influential, you never hear their names.
[01:12:43.658 --> 01:12:48.821]  Yeah, because I know you always hear that Bill Gates is supposedly the richest guy.
[01:12:48.861 --> 01:13:01.170]  Yeah, I mean, the globalists make, in a day, off derivatives and the stage currency speculation markets, what Bill Gates supposedly has with $80-something billion, you know, after the stock market went down, it was $120 billion.
[01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:11.136]  I mean, Bill Gates was nouveau riche, middle class, to the elite, and they told him, they said, we're going to break you up unless you give $24 billion for inoculation.
[01:13:13.843 --> 01:13:15.985]  Just like Ted Turner, you know, he gave a billion bucks.
[01:13:16.485 --> 01:13:22.910]  The guy's always calling us useless feeders and how we need forced sterilization and how we need to, you know, only have one kid.
[01:13:23.271 --> 01:13:25.913]  But then he loves the little black kids.
[01:13:26.293 --> 01:13:32.538]  He gives a billion dollars so they get their little shots because he loves them.
[01:13:32.558 --> 01:13:37.782]  I mean, folks, can you put two and two together or do you want to be dumb slaves?
[01:13:39.344 --> 01:13:43.087]  And I guess the last thing I wanted to leave you with kind of ties into that.
[01:13:44.474 --> 01:13:54.324]  I was wondering if there's any groups of people specifically that are willing to form communities that are in opposition to this type of thing.
[01:13:54.624 --> 01:14:06.796]  The problem with that is, if it's a bunch of people out on a ranch living in their little cabins, is they'll just insert a provocateur who will, you know, it'll be in some state where...
[01:14:07.859 --> 01:14:10.440]  You can't sell guns without a license.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.621]  You can't sell your neighbor a shotgun.
[01:14:12.661 --> 01:14:22.324]  And so the provocateur will get into the community for a year, sell a gun to somebody that's totally legal but, quote, didn't do the gun show background check.
[01:14:22.784 --> 01:14:31.947]  SWAT teams will come in, machine gun children, shoot their dogs, hold up dead dogs on TV, run around laughing, burn the place down and be called heroes.
[01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:33.227]  Of course, that happened at Waco.
[01:14:34.171 --> 01:14:38.512]  And did you know at Waco they shot the dogs in the kennels and then held up the dead puppies?
[01:14:39.372 --> 01:14:43.753]  And then the made-for-TV movie had the BATF saving the puppies.
[01:14:43.773 --> 01:14:51.655]  Of course, if there's video of them killing the dogs and it's admitted, then they beat up the cameraman from the local news station because, you know, he was up with Al Qaeda.
[01:14:51.735 --> 01:14:53.355]  Anytime they attack us it's because we're terrorists.
[01:14:53.375 --> 01:14:54.355]  They never did anything wrong.
[01:14:54.956 --> 01:14:58.636]  But what you can do is take over counties and cities.
[01:14:59.097 --> 01:15:01.097]  You can get in there, educate the public,
[01:15:02.031 --> 01:15:07.239]  That's more what I was talking about.
[01:15:07.279 --> 01:15:08.962]  Are there any towns out there like that?
[01:15:09.082 --> 01:15:12.548]  Yeah, there's over 400 cities that have passed laws against the Patriot Act.
[01:15:13.514 --> 01:15:17.057]  There are state legislatures that are conservative, like Alaska just did it.
[01:15:17.677 --> 01:15:22.461]  And as people are educated, you know, Patriot Act says they can arrest you and execute you in secret.
[01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:23.281]  You're never seen again.
[01:15:23.541 --> 01:15:24.482]  You're on a milk carton.
[01:15:24.882 --> 01:15:26.223]  Well, you just read that to somebody.
[01:15:26.243 --> 01:15:26.984]  It's shown in the U.S.
[01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:27.424]  Code.
[01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:30.487]  You can say, are you for arresting us secretly?
[01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.768]  And they'll pass a law saying no.
[01:15:33.549 --> 01:15:38.933]  This stuff's so over the top now, if we just have the courage to face the horror of it, it'll all come to a screeching halt.
[01:15:39.513 --> 01:15:40.654]  Or we can be enslaved.
[01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:43.771]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:43.791 --> 01:15:44.472]  No, no, thank you.
[01:15:44.872 --> 01:15:45.273]  Thank you.
[01:15:46.153 --> 01:15:53.598]  All right, Roy and Lucinda and Bobby and everybody else, your calls are coming up in this next segment.
[01:15:53.618 --> 01:15:57.001]  I'm kind of, this stuff's getting to me, folks.
[01:15:57.221 --> 01:16:01.304]  I mean, I read the documents where they plan to satellite track you and tax you in your car.
[01:16:02.722 --> 01:16:06.944]  And I had a lot of yuppie slobs make fun of me as I read the federal documents.
[01:16:07.444 --> 01:16:16.468]  Now it's in AP and Reuters and BBC and DWTV, and I'm saying now's the time to admit that the sun really comes up in the morning, okay?
[01:16:17.049 --> 01:16:18.449]  It's time to be big now.
[01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:23.652]  It's time to admit they're putting thumb scanners in the grocery stores in Arlington, Texas.
[01:16:23.692 --> 01:16:28.614]  I got the Arlington newspaper here, Dallas Morning News, ordered everyone to thumb scan to buy and sell.
[01:16:30.275 --> 01:16:32.657]  They're announcing it now, making all the shopkeepers.
[01:16:32.717 --> 01:16:34.218]  I mean, it's happening, folks.
[01:16:34.278 --> 01:16:36.300]  It's just total end of America.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:41.205]  How do you get excited about sports and yell and scream, but you can't get excited about this?
[01:16:43.948 --> 01:16:48.431]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:52.893]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:53.173 --> 01:16:53.734]  We listened.
[01:16:54.034 --> 01:16:59.017]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:59.297 --> 01:16:59.777]  We listened.
[01:17:00.158 --> 01:17:03.199]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:04.140]  We listened.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.683]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:17:09.063 --> 01:17:09.543]  We listened.
[01:17:09.884 --> 01:17:15.127]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:16.908]  Again, we listened.
[01:17:17.269 --> 01:17:24.654]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:17:25.034 --> 01:17:29.477]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at

[01:17:37.601 --> 01:17:40.442]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:17:42.323 --> 01:17:43.164]  Do you want the news?
[01:17:43.424 --> 01:17:44.624]  I mean the real news.
[01:17:44.924 --> 01:17:46.405]  Because you're sure not getting it now.
[01:17:46.785 --> 01:17:49.926]  If you'll open your ears, we'll open your eyes, and we'll open your mind.
[01:17:50.246 --> 01:17:54.048]  What did the government know about the possibility of terrorist attacks prior to 9-11?
[01:17:54.368 --> 01:17:57.970]  Is mainstream media telling you everything you should know about the war on terror?
[01:17:58.350 --> 01:18:01.191]  What is our real interest in Iraq and Saddam Hussein?
[01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:02.091]  We're the real deal.
[01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:03.391]  We mean business, and we're here to stay.
[01:18:03.431 --> 01:18:05.232]  For news that's in your face, and sometimes shocking...

[01:18:41.587 --> 01:18:42.567]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:18:42.647 --> 01:18:47.428]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:18:47.608 --> 01:18:55.410]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:18:55.670 --> 01:19:01.031]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:19:01.231 --> 01:19:08.213]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:19:08.613 --> 01:19:09.234]  We're good to go.
[01:19:09.274 --> 01:19:09.474]  I think?
[01:19:27.126 --> 01:19:28.947]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237 That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:19:41.201 --> 01:19:44.662]  What if you could actually save money on everything you ever needed to buy?

[01:20:23.823 --> 01:20:24.643]  Hey folks, I'm sorry.
[01:20:51.943 --> 01:20:57.788]  It's a normal response to start hyperventilating on the air and freaking out over concentration camps.
[01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:06.215]  AP, LA Times, Reuters, Denver Post, you know, just hundreds of articles, folks, hundreds of them.
[01:21:06.716 --> 01:21:10.198]  We're building these camps and we do chain you down for your safety.
[01:21:11.386 --> 01:21:17.168]  The terrorists are going to hit us, and we're going to have to do this, and during a red alert, you can't leave your house.
[01:21:17.248 --> 01:21:21.610]  If you do, you'll be permanently detained at a, quote, re-education center.
[01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:25.931]  I mean, they're saying this in the Gannett News Service?
[01:21:27.512 --> 01:21:33.634]  Folks, my new film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, and I'm about to go to Roy and Lucinda and Dan and everybody else.
[01:21:33.654 --> 01:21:35.335]  This is not a plug, not yet, but
[01:21:35.945 --> 01:21:57.381]  Police State 3 total enslavement, it's 2 hours and 40 minutes of AP, Reuters, Austin American Statesman, bam, bam, bam, telling you how good the camps are, telling you how good the satellite tracker boxes are, telling you how good the police state is, telling you how good the open... I mean, it's all just their information, and people go, wait a minute, you said don't trust the mainstream media.
[01:21:57.501 --> 01:21:57.762]  No.
[01:21:58.502 --> 01:22:00.404]  What I said is they put a spin on it.
[01:22:00.444 --> 01:22:01.825]  They've got to sell it to you.
[01:22:02.286 --> 01:22:04.988]  To get you to accept all this, they've got to tell you about it.
[01:22:05.329 --> 01:22:10.714]  While they were building it five, six, seven, eight years ago, they were very quiet about it.
[01:22:10.754 --> 01:22:11.975]  You never saw it in the news.
[01:22:12.296 --> 01:22:14.017]  You had to go to government documents.
[01:22:14.718 --> 01:22:15.198]  Okay?
[01:22:16.219 --> 01:22:19.402]  That was the age of the media just lying blanketly.
[01:22:19.482 --> 01:22:22.906]  And they still do that about 10% of the time, just bald-faced total lies.
[01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:29.175]  But about five years ago they began shifting, and now they've shifted over again to about 90-10.
[01:22:29.195 --> 01:22:31.917]  90% of it is true.
[01:22:32.377 --> 01:22:34.618]  It just has some sickening spin on it.
[01:22:36.399 --> 01:22:40.422]  It's like the New Yorker magazine or National Geographic.
[01:22:40.442 --> 01:22:42.223]  They both had articles in the last year about...
[01:22:43.274 --> 01:22:52.660]  Yeah, these wars going into the Gold Coast of Africa are really about the Brewers keeping its diamond monopoly and the oil companies getting the oil and gold.
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:53.841]  But so what?
[01:22:53.881 --> 01:22:54.621]  We need it.
[01:22:55.502 --> 01:22:58.003]  It's good for us, and we know best anyways.
[01:22:58.063 --> 01:23:00.465]  And it was like white man's burden stuff.
[01:23:01.446 --> 01:23:03.687]  I thought I was reading Kipling or something.
[01:23:04.047 --> 01:23:06.729]  So that's what they say there.
[01:23:07.129 --> 01:23:08.370]  It's just, yes, we're doing it.
[01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:11.432]  Yes, it's about getting the diamonds.
[01:23:12.574 --> 01:23:14.275]  But it's not like we're going to get those diamonds.
[01:23:14.315 --> 01:23:20.159]  In fact, by them doing this, it ensures that those diamonds stay $1,000 a half carat.
[01:23:22.121 --> 01:23:25.103]  That's all they're doing.
[01:23:25.183 --> 01:23:31.047]  It's said, insuring the monopoly for the family that owns De Beers.
[01:23:34.389 --> 01:23:36.751]  I mean, it's a sick joke, people.
[01:23:38.368 --> 01:23:48.994]  You've got a bunch of fat cat families that want power and want more power, want to maintain their power, and they got you convinced the government's this sweet little thing that doesn't lie to you and doesn't take care of you.
[01:23:49.454 --> 01:23:52.676]  Folks, about a month ago, I read the BBC where they said they had U.S.
[01:23:52.716 --> 01:23:55.518]  and British troops for 20 years from 1960s to 1980s sit.
[01:23:58.059 --> 01:24:05.147]  Out in tanks and on trucks and be sprayed in the English Welsh countryside.
[01:24:05.387 --> 01:24:14.196]  They just have a helicopter fly over and spray them, and they die, they get sick, and they admit the government just cold-blooded murder!
[01:24:15.518 --> 01:24:17.219]  And you trust this government.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:20.463]  You trust them as far as you can throw them, people.
[01:24:21.539 --> 01:24:22.980]  People, it's crazy.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.521]  I've read their plans.
[01:24:24.922 --> 01:24:26.082]  You've got to listen to me.
[01:24:26.283 --> 01:24:27.303]  You've got to research.
[01:24:27.323 --> 01:24:30.406]  You've got to look into history and then look at what's being set up today.
[01:24:30.886 --> 01:24:34.369]  Just read 1984 and then turn on the nightly news.
[01:24:34.689 --> 01:24:37.251]  Watch The Running Man and turn on the news.
[01:24:37.711 --> 01:24:40.373]  You've been in it so long, you can't recognize it.
[01:24:42.094 --> 01:24:48.039]  It'd be like teleporting a black man from New York City
[01:24:49.662 --> 01:24:54.250]  Back to, you know, a middle-class black American back to 1835 North Carolina.
[01:24:58.587 --> 01:25:05.973]  And it'd be like having that black man walk up in a suit to a black slave bent over a plow and saying, listen, brother, you're a human being.
[01:25:05.993 --> 01:25:07.054]  You can say no to this.
[01:25:07.395 --> 01:25:08.435]  You're being treated wrong.
[01:25:08.716 --> 01:25:10.297]  And then the slaves were conditioned.
[01:25:10.317 --> 01:25:11.658]  They had handbooks on how to do it.
[01:25:11.918 --> 01:25:13.360]  He'd go, how dare you?
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.141]  I'm calling master right now.
[01:25:15.201 --> 01:25:17.763]  Master, master, he's bad, he's bad, he's bad.
[01:25:18.144 --> 01:25:19.605]  Get him, get him, get him.
[01:25:20.466 --> 01:25:22.287]  He'd run in the house.
[01:25:22.307 --> 01:25:24.149]  What kind of scary black man is this?
[01:25:25.074 --> 01:25:30.837]  He's trying to talk about my master that does so much for me and brings me all the goodies.
[01:25:32.017 --> 01:25:33.118]  It makes me sick!
[01:25:33.638 --> 01:25:35.599]  You people make me sick!
[01:25:36.019 --> 01:25:39.540]  Our whole society's being destroyed right now.
[01:25:40.061 --> 01:25:41.461]  I am freaked out.
[01:25:41.801 --> 01:25:47.544]  I can't believe how fast it's moving, how evil it is, how out of control this system is.
[01:25:49.625 --> 01:25:49.925]  There.
[01:25:50.065 --> 01:25:53.507]  I got as excited as somebody does when their team scores a touchdown.
[01:25:53.687 --> 01:25:54.507]  But I'm weird.
[01:25:54.787 --> 01:25:56.988]  I get excited about the destruction of America.
[01:25:57.688 --> 01:26:00.950]  I get excited because I want to defend this country and my family.
[01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:06.532]  I'm a weirdo, but the guy that screams and yells about the 49ers making a touchdown, he's normal and good.
[01:26:06.852 --> 01:26:08.273]  See how sick you are?
[01:26:08.653 --> 01:26:10.233]  See how screwed up you are?
[01:26:10.253 --> 01:26:18.877]  I promise we'll go right to Roy, Lucinda, Dan, and others when we get back, and then I'm going to try to settle down and just get into some news.
[01:26:18.977 --> 01:26:19.217]  I just...
[01:26:20.504 --> 01:26:29.233]  What happens is I read this stuff for three or four hours in the morning and at night, and by the time I get on the air, I just can't stand it anymore!
[01:26:29.293 --> 01:26:30.474]  It's out of control!
[01:26:32.936 --> 01:26:33.877]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.338 --> 01:26:35.939]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:39.543]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.047 --> 01:26:45.009]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:45.770]  Hello, folks.
[01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:56.039]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light... 340-7091.
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:59.783]  That web address again is calbinpuresoap.com.
[01:27:00.023 --> 01:27:02.866]  Try Pure Soap once, and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:27:06.554 --> 01:27:07.015]  Don't worry.
[01:27:07.515 --> 01:27:09.037]  This show is documented.
[01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:12.340]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:15.183]  All right, folks.
[01:27:15.223 --> 01:27:19.627]  We'll just try to boil it down one more time calmly.
[01:27:19.647 --> 01:27:22.490]  The government has announced dozens and dozens and dozens.
[01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:23.651]  No one's quite sure.
[01:27:24.131 --> 01:27:25.252]  The official number's been 36.
[01:27:25.292 --> 01:27:27.454]  Now they're saying more.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.562]  Giant Bioweapons Labs, Level 4.
[01:27:33.663 --> 01:27:37.045]  Now, Level 4 just isn't an anthrax or a smallpox.
[01:27:37.165 --> 01:27:41.528]  It's weaponized stuff, and it means it's in large quantities.
[01:27:43.029 --> 01:27:45.230]  And they're going to build these in most major U.S.
[01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.771]  cities.
[01:27:47.151 --> 01:27:48.792]  They're in the process of building them.
[01:27:49.573 --> 01:27:55.957]  And, folks, just so you understand, this is ten times, conservatively, more dangerous...
[01:27:56.727 --> 01:28:01.393]  Than having a giant nuclear power plant in your city.
[01:28:02.394 --> 01:28:07.861]  We have had porting down bioweapons lab three years ago, the same place where they kill U.S.
[01:28:07.901 --> 01:28:09.383]  troops and admit it later.
[01:28:10.064 --> 01:28:12.087]  Just 20 years ago, we're killing them there and just admit it.
[01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:15.291]  They released foot and mouth.
[01:28:15.691 --> 01:28:17.252]  Now, that came out, was admitted.
[01:28:17.272 --> 01:28:18.372]  They said, oh, it was an accident.
[01:28:18.392 --> 01:28:21.014]  We don't know how, you know, from this underground base.
[01:28:21.634 --> 01:28:26.336]  It just showed up in over a dozen places from Scotland to Ireland simultaneously.
[01:28:26.496 --> 01:28:42.864]  I predicted with a prime projection by analyzing the different strata and data, the data throughout the different levels of propaganda in the strata, that the environmental minister would declare, and I did this on air over and over again, that no cows or sheep can be restocked.
[01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:46.991]  Because, after all, they've been bad to the environment.
[01:28:47.032 --> 01:28:47.752]  They're runoff.
[01:28:47.792 --> 01:28:52.755]  They're methane gas ejections and they're flatulence.
[01:28:54.336 --> 01:28:59.119]  And their environmental minister, after culling 8 million sheep, 4 million cows, said just that.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:00.640]  You can't restock.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:03.262]  We'll buy your land for nothing and take it over.
[01:29:04.161 --> 01:29:06.523]  It's all about centralization, and of course that happened.
[01:29:07.404 --> 01:29:31.524]  So we have these bioweapons labs that are being built everywhere, and I just read earlier where a monkey escaped from one, and the Baltimore Sun has reported at these things they're producing thousands of gallons, thousands of gallons, just at the dozens they already have, thousands of gallons of weaponized Ebola in smallpox, thousands of gallons, quote, to study it and treat it.
[01:29:31.545 --> 01:29:31.885]  Mm-hmm.
[01:29:32.722 --> 01:29:34.523]  The same groups that kill our troops with it.
[01:29:35.123 --> 01:29:40.806]  The same groups that will get complete power and total control out of releasing a thimble of it.
[01:29:41.266 --> 01:29:49.250]  The crisis that will come out of it will give them the excuse to let their tyranny sweep out across the land a hundredfold, which you've so far seen.
[01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:52.252]  They've just spread the trap, set the time.
[01:29:52.592 --> 01:29:55.313]  Now you follow right into the middle of it.
[01:29:55.493 --> 01:29:59.015]  And I have to watch these serial killers laying their trap.
[01:30:00.359 --> 01:30:03.962]  And there's only a few thousand globalists and their top technicians doing all this.
[01:30:04.022 --> 01:30:11.407]  Everyone else is compartmentalized in different subdirectorates, like Lego pieces that are all put together at the time of their desire.
[01:30:12.668 --> 01:30:19.712]  That's why they're setting the precedent, having to announce all this, having to legitimize torture and biotesting on our cities.
[01:30:20.253 --> 01:30:25.977]  That way, when the pilots that have sprayed cities a hundred times with biologicals get up there to really spray it for real...
[01:30:26.895 --> 01:30:27.856]  I can't handle it anymore.
[01:30:27.876 --> 01:30:28.917]  It's out of control, people!
[01:30:51.064 --> 01:30:51.685]  God help us.
[01:30:51.745 --> 01:30:52.286]  Please, God.
[01:30:52.366 --> 01:30:53.327]  Please heal this land.
[01:30:53.567 --> 01:30:53.908]  I mean it.
[01:30:54.488 --> 01:30:54.909]  Amen.
[01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:56.971]  Let's take calls here.
[01:30:58.213 --> 01:31:00.415]  Let's talk to Roy in Florida.
[01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:01.497]  Go ahead and thanks for holding.
[01:31:02.518 --> 01:31:03.038]  Yes, Alex.
[01:31:03.139 --> 01:31:03.779]  Can you hear me?
[01:31:03.819 --> 01:31:04.260]  Yes, sir.
[01:31:05.181 --> 01:31:07.664]  Well, you know, terrorism is real good.
[01:31:08.265 --> 01:31:09.907]  And now we can make money at it, Alex.
[01:31:11.195 --> 01:31:13.997]  Just by predicting when the next attack happens.
[01:31:14.578 --> 01:31:25.446]  Yeah, the globalists who are behind the attacks can now bet on... It's making insider trading, legal and lawful, run by the government.
[01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:31.971]  Betting on when American soldiers will die or when American citizens will be nuked by North Korea.
[01:31:33.412 --> 01:31:33.752]  Geez.
[01:31:34.213 --> 01:31:37.175]  I mean, talk about adding insult to injury.
[01:31:38.433 --> 01:31:41.874]  Hey, you're with Al-Qaeda because you're against betting on our soldiers' deaths.
[01:31:42.294 --> 01:31:45.855]  You only get money if they die, but again, that's part of the freedom.
[01:31:46.255 --> 01:31:53.777]  Actually caring about troops and not wanting them to huff deadly depleted uranium, which the Army's former top scientist admits is hurting them and killing them.
[01:31:54.737 --> 01:31:56.297]  It's good to have them huff that.
[01:32:00.458 --> 01:32:03.139]  That story is absolutely outrageous.
[01:32:03.815 --> 01:32:07.678]  And one good thing about it is... But see, it's outrageous because it got a lot of attention.
[01:32:08.098 --> 01:32:10.500]  When the BBC reports that Porton Down killed U.S.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.382]  soldiers on purpose under U.S.
[01:32:12.422 --> 01:32:20.748]  government orders in the 1980s, it's in the BBC once, and no one ever hears about it, and some idiot in a checkout line will accuse me of making it up.
[01:32:20.788 --> 01:32:21.229]  Go ahead.
[01:32:23.591 --> 01:32:24.111]  Go ahead, Roy.
[01:32:24.131 --> 01:32:24.671]  I'm sorry.
[01:32:26.873 --> 01:32:28.735]  I just... What are they going to do next?
[01:32:30.836 --> 01:32:31.677]  You know, betting...
[01:32:33.652 --> 01:32:35.133]  Betting on terrorism.
[01:32:36.374 --> 01:32:38.596]  It's just got me.
[01:32:40.378 --> 01:32:50.186]  And I'll tell you, it's got most ordinary people that have seen this article outraged.
[01:32:51.167 --> 01:32:51.827]  Maybe it'll help.
[01:32:52.127 --> 01:32:57.051]  Well, look, guess who runs the Pentagon, Deadpool, and our soldiers?
[01:32:58.132 --> 01:32:58.793]  Queen Dexter.
[01:32:59.412 --> 01:32:59.512]  Yep.
[01:32:59.532 --> 01:32:59.732]  Yep.
[01:33:24.319 --> 01:33:35.223]  And I'm down there, and literally, I'm just by a workstation, right out in the open area where the graduate students are, and there's DARPA mind control documents laying there.
[01:33:36.584 --> 01:33:46.388]  And a researcher walks by, you know, it's like 12 o'clock at night, I'm up working doing this, and shooting some video, and all of a sudden this researcher walks by and he goes, Alex Jones, we're big fans.
[01:33:46.448 --> 01:33:47.969]  And I go, what's all the DARPA stuff?
[01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:51.370]  He goes, well, most of our departments fight not to take DARPA, but
[01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:54.351]  The DARPA money, but they said DARPA's everything.
[01:33:55.231 --> 01:33:56.992]  DARPA, and it's all mind control.
[01:33:57.072 --> 01:33:59.073]  It's a giant mind control facility.
[01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:00.534]  It's lavish.
[01:34:00.594 --> 01:34:02.374]  I mean, the place is gigantic.
[01:34:03.835 --> 01:34:05.836]  And look, I'm just in the areas you're allowed to be in.
[01:34:06.256 --> 01:34:08.397]  A lot of it's classified and walled off.
[01:34:10.318 --> 01:34:10.538]  Yeah.
[01:34:11.518 --> 01:34:20.082]  Well, I just had to express my thoughts on this subject.
[01:34:20.589 --> 01:34:21.289]  Well, thank you.
[01:34:21.389 --> 01:34:33.514]  I mean, my whole point here is, Roy, is that I go down just to shoot some video in some cool hallways, because the place is incredible, and, you know, there's DARPA documents of how to mind control us laying there.
[01:34:33.574 --> 01:34:35.955]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:34:37.015 --> 01:34:37.395]  I don't know.
[01:34:37.475 --> 01:34:48.239]  People point this out, but any time I go on a road trip or I pick up a video camera to go do something, the most crazy things happen, and I guess God just guides me and puts me in the right place at the right time, but
[01:34:49.269 --> 01:34:50.470]  You know, it's like the takeover.
[01:34:51.531 --> 01:35:05.664]  We walk into the police station in Florida and say, we'd like to talk about the troops working with the police, and a woman comes running from behind the counter screaming, shoot everyone, martial law, blah!
[01:35:06.204 --> 01:35:08.987]  I mean, how do I get this on tape?
[01:35:11.269 --> 01:35:12.009]  Anything else, Roy?
[01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:13.351]  No, that's it.
[01:35:14.224 --> 01:35:15.705]  That's the latest outreach.
[01:35:15.765 --> 01:35:16.406]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:35:16.526 --> 01:35:17.227]  Hold on a second, Roy.
[01:35:17.247 --> 01:35:18.928]  For those that just joined us, I don't want to run over you.
[01:35:18.948 --> 01:35:20.590]  I want to give you time.
[01:35:20.730 --> 01:35:29.897]  For those that just joined us, for those that don't know what we're talking about, because a lot of folks don't know about this, tell them in a nutshell what the Pentagon announced on Monday and canceled yesterday.
[01:35:33.821 --> 01:35:40.927]  It's the political analysis management section of DARPA.
[01:35:42.566 --> 01:35:54.671]  And what they're doing is they say that greedy corporate types are better at predicting the future than their experts.
[01:35:57.092 --> 01:36:01.874]  No kidding that the CFR people know when the next terror attack's happening.
[01:36:02.953 --> 01:36:07.454]  So, yeah, now they get to legally make money off their insider knowledge.
[01:36:08.374 --> 01:36:10.534]  As the news said, terrorists can strike and make money.
[01:36:10.554 --> 01:36:16.635]  Yeah, it happened on 9-1-1, folks, with the insider trading on the airlines, and that led back to the CIA.
[01:36:18.336 --> 01:36:26.517]  And can you imagine Tom Ridge getting in front of the TV saying, well, I made money on this last terrorist attack.
[01:36:27.577 --> 01:36:32.258]  But, I don't know, they're doing everything
[01:36:33.798 --> 01:36:39.203]  You know, the remote readers, everything under the sun to try to predict the future.
[01:36:41.345 --> 01:36:46.490]  And this is just another method that they're using to... But, I mean, predict the future.
[01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:52.215]  They know when the next terror attack's going to take place, and so the Pentagon's going to run the betting parlor...
[01:36:53.181 --> 01:36:53.241]  Yes.
[01:36:53.281 --> 01:36:55.904]  I mean, that's just the top level.
[01:36:56.045 --> 01:36:57.106]  That's just the crust.
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:11.781]  Then you've got their excuse, oh, it's to predict and save lives.
[01:37:12.441 --> 01:37:23.666]  Then you've got the fact that it's to get us involved in a betting running man thing where there's always got to be a war so these greedy idiot sports fans, these cult members can have something to bet on.
[01:37:24.586 --> 01:37:29.168]  And then, at the same time, it's about having insider trading right out in full view.
[01:37:29.887 --> 01:37:33.829]  The globalists have got to do everything in plain view because their minions aren't evil.
[01:37:33.889 --> 01:37:35.670]  They're just mindless rubber stamps.
[01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:37.350]  Their minions just follow orders.
[01:37:37.450 --> 01:37:39.871]  And if it's been announced, it must be okay.
[01:37:39.931 --> 01:37:41.472]  See, it's all about peer pressure.
[01:37:41.812 --> 01:37:43.553]  So they've got to announce they're doing this.
[01:37:45.174 --> 01:37:45.354]  Yeah.
[01:37:46.074 --> 01:37:51.696]  It's like them getting on the news and saying, not only do we need to torture al-Qaeda suspects, but their children.
[01:37:51.716 --> 01:37:55.198]  And then the pundits all say, yes, yes, that's very good.
[01:37:56.110 --> 01:38:09.176]  And also, you know, since the real terrorists are being kept in a safe haven, well, they just send them out, and they know the job's going to be well done.
[01:38:09.896 --> 01:38:10.496]  Exactly.
[01:38:10.536 --> 01:38:11.257]  Thanks for the call.
[01:38:11.377 --> 01:38:12.957]  Appreciate it, Roy.
[01:38:12.977 --> 01:38:13.538]  Great points.
[01:38:13.578 --> 01:38:14.638]  Lucinda, thanks for holding.
[01:38:14.658 --> 01:38:15.879]  You're on the air from Kansas.
[01:38:15.899 --> 01:38:16.199]  Welcome.
[01:38:16.639 --> 01:38:16.999]  Hello?
[01:38:17.299 --> 01:38:17.820]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:18.720]  Hi.
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:21.201]  Yeah, I'm calling.
[01:38:21.301 --> 01:38:25.523]  I just recently started listening to the radio show, and I have some questions.
[01:38:26.289 --> 01:38:26.910]  Sure.
[01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:37.818]  The first one is, it got announced that we have a camera system here in Wichita at the light, and the only thing they're going to do is take a picture of your license plate if you run a red light.
[01:38:38.318 --> 01:38:40.660]  Is that all it's going to do?
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:40.920]  No.
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:51.888]  It's been announced that the cameras are paid for by the federal government with a state supplement, and they are hooked into data grids with software to read each camera.
[01:38:51.908 --> 01:38:55.531]  It can read up to 1,000 license plates in a full field view shot,
[01:38:56.888 --> 01:38:59.221]  1,000 in a single second, as if they even need that type of power.
[01:39:00.027 --> 01:39:01.187]  They face scan you.
[01:39:01.207 --> 01:39:10.729]  If you look, the cameras, at least the second phase they'll put in, I don't know if they put in the second phase in your area, will face scan you, and it's hooked in and designed by DARPA.
[01:39:11.409 --> 01:39:19.731]  Generally, they will then, in the third phase, like they've done in Austin, put cameras in the neighborhoods with shotgun microphone pods, again, hooked into DARPA.
[01:39:20.071 --> 01:39:21.912]  That was done in 98 here in Austin.
[01:39:23.052 --> 01:39:26.452]  And, again, cameras in your neighborhood with microphones is 1984.
[01:39:26.492 --> 01:39:27.133]  It's not a free country.
[01:39:29.412 --> 01:39:30.072]  Yeah.
[01:39:30.133 --> 01:39:34.915]  Wichita also has announced thumb scanners to go in your grocery stores to buy and sell.
[01:39:35.436 --> 01:39:41.720]  I asked one of my grocery store people about that, and he said he'd heard a rumor, but they hadn't made a decision yet.
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:42.420]  Heard a rumor?
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.080]  It was announced.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.781]  What's your Wichita daily paper?
[01:39:45.882 --> 01:39:47.283]  Oh, the Wichita Eagle Beacon.
[01:39:47.383 --> 01:39:48.364]  Yes, that's it.
[01:39:48.444 --> 01:39:50.465]  I failed the data transmission.
[01:39:50.505 --> 01:39:58.890]  But, yeah, about three weeks ago, that article said that your major grocery stores within one year will be forcing you to thumb scan to buy and sell.
[01:40:00.157 --> 01:40:01.758]  Okay.
[01:40:02.258 --> 01:40:03.919]  That's your Wichita paper.
[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:09.402]  That's the CEO of what's the big, what's the grocery store chain based in Wichita?
[01:40:09.943 --> 01:40:10.243]  Dillon?
[01:40:10.823 --> 01:40:11.123]  Yeah.
[01:40:11.884 --> 01:40:12.824]  I'm going from memory here.
[01:40:13.205 --> 01:40:14.125]  I'm failing right now.
[01:40:14.145 --> 01:40:16.567]  Usually I can remember this, but I think that's it.
[01:40:17.027 --> 01:40:18.167]  I specifically can't.
[01:40:18.428 --> 01:40:19.528]  I read the article on air.
[01:40:21.209 --> 01:40:21.890]  Uh-huh.
[01:40:21.930 --> 01:40:25.872]  I mean, again, you call in and I remember just in your neck of the woods what they're doing.
[01:40:26.752 --> 01:40:28.173]  Look, it's all planned.
[01:40:28.213 --> 01:40:29.294]  It's all agreed.
[01:40:30.425 --> 01:40:31.646]  Yeah.
[01:40:32.166 --> 01:40:36.147]  Are they trying to do this so that they can get felons and terrorists?
[01:40:37.228 --> 01:40:40.949]  Is that what they're... Well, they are the terrorists.
[01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:41.810]  Yeah.
[01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.310]  See?
[01:40:42.330 --> 01:40:43.891]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:44.271 --> 01:40:50.173]  They carry out terror and say, we've got to run your life and we've got to take your rights now to keep you safe.
[01:40:50.213 --> 01:40:53.374]  I mean, how many times have you heard them, give up liberty, you get security?
[01:40:53.394 --> 01:40:56.576]  Well, you know, in history, if you give up liberty, what do you get?
[01:40:56.596 --> 01:40:57.656]  Tyranny.
[01:40:58.216 --> 01:40:58.817]  Exactly.
[01:40:58.937 --> 01:40:59.777]  So... Yeah.
[01:41:00.914 --> 01:41:04.435]  Look, I would just challenge you to, do you have a computer?
[01:41:04.895 --> 01:41:06.415]  I don't have one right now.
[01:41:06.535 --> 01:41:13.537]  I just got this shortwave radio, and I just heard it picked up your station by a fluke one morning.
[01:41:15.197 --> 01:41:16.597]  And it's interesting.
[01:41:16.757 --> 01:41:22.979]  I think Wichita can barely pick up, because I was up there and was listening to it in Wichita.
[01:41:23.239 --> 01:41:29.120]  I'm pretty sure I heard our affiliate in Kansas City from there
[01:41:29.955 --> 01:41:33.596]  And I know they're in the process of upping the power, too, so I know you'll be able to soon.
[01:41:34.216 --> 01:41:40.657]  Yeah, because there's times when the station just goes really, really, I mean, it's like dead.
[01:41:41.397 --> 01:41:43.638]  Yeah, during the day, shortwave's not very good.
[01:41:43.958 --> 01:41:45.138]  You need to listen at night.
[01:41:45.318 --> 01:41:47.019]  From 9 to midnight, it comes in a lot better.
[01:41:47.999 --> 01:41:49.739]  Okay.
[01:41:50.039 --> 01:41:50.119]  5.085 and 6890.
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:51.920]  Okay.
[01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:55.940]  I just have a little handheld shortwave radio and the antenna broke.
[01:41:56.721 --> 01:41:57.661]  Well, that's your problem.
[01:41:57.861 --> 01:41:58.341]  That's...
[01:41:59.324 --> 01:42:07.374]  Okay, and I found out, I was listening to a, I listen to talk radio a lot, and I'm always trying to get information wherever I can.
[01:42:09.357 --> 01:42:12.461]  Walmart is one group that's doing this.
[01:42:12.621 --> 01:42:13.042]  I don't know.
[01:42:14.023 --> 01:42:17.067]  What they have is these little chips that are the size of,
[01:42:17.856 --> 01:42:20.678]  Ma'am, I'm not bragging.
[01:42:20.758 --> 01:42:22.519]  I've been talking about this for six years.
[01:42:22.979 --> 01:42:25.220]  Hex Mars wrote a book about it seven years ago.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:28.362]  Well, there's another lady that was talking about it last night.
[01:42:28.402 --> 01:42:29.983]  Her last name is Albright.
[01:42:30.043 --> 01:42:30.883]  Yeah, we've had her on.
[01:42:31.323 --> 01:42:39.448]  And they got the secret documents from inside Walmart with Homeland Security as a master plan for total control.
[01:42:40.268 --> 01:42:47.052]  Yeah, because they'll take your picture when you take something off a shelf, and then they'll take your picture again when you...
[01:42:48.185 --> 01:42:50.106]  There's a little tracking device in it.
[01:42:50.206 --> 01:42:55.488]  Gillette purchased like 500 million of these little granular chips.
[01:42:55.909 --> 01:43:02.912]  And what they do with it is they then access the driver's license database that took the digital photo.
[01:43:02.932 --> 01:43:09.314]  And when you leave, this is the plan, they scan your name onto the chip and then track you with it.
[01:43:10.615 --> 01:43:15.757]  And we already have these documents from the Office of Naval Intelligence that develop these.
[01:43:16.658 --> 01:43:17.098]  But now...
[01:43:18.288 --> 01:43:30.127]  The idiots at the RFID Center at MIT, the consortium with the Pentagon and Walmart, had a back door that was open, didn't have to hack it,
[01:43:31.348 --> 01:43:36.492]  Some of their classified documents were accessible, so the public got them.
[01:43:36.932 --> 01:43:40.354]  And Walmart and others admit, yeah, they're very angry.
[01:43:40.374 --> 01:43:42.315]  And they've been meeting with Homeland Security.
[01:43:42.595 --> 01:43:45.918]  It's a giant cashless society grid control system.
[01:43:46.258 --> 01:43:47.218]  As we said it was.
[01:43:47.258 --> 01:43:48.399]  I mean, it's pretty obvious.
[01:43:48.459 --> 01:43:50.921]  But does that make you angry?
[01:43:51.641 --> 01:43:53.442]  Well, it has me disturbed.
[01:43:53.502 --> 01:43:56.884]  I mean, am I going to be one of them that's going to get put in a camp and shot?
[01:43:57.265 --> 01:43:57.505]  No.
[01:43:58.234 --> 01:44:04.620]  Let's say you're a big liberal, but you've got a business that a member of the Homeland Security Board in your state wants.
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:08.624]  Yeah, you'll get arrested, and a lot of you will never be seen.
[01:44:08.644 --> 01:44:14.069]  They'll just shoot you a couple times, throw you in a meat grinder or a vat of acid or down into a coal mine.
[01:44:15.370 --> 01:44:21.856]  Up in Inez, Kentucky, they built a Supermax on top of a large coal mine to get rid of the bodies.
[01:44:23.268 --> 01:44:24.329]  So, yeah.
[01:44:24.909 --> 01:44:26.870]  Generally, if you've got something they want.
[01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:29.872]  I mean, maybe a local Gestapo captain wants your husband.
[01:44:30.952 --> 01:44:32.153]  Or, you know, wants your wife.
[01:44:33.534 --> 01:44:34.494]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:35.775 --> 01:44:36.456]  Yeah, they'll kill you.
[01:44:36.956 --> 01:44:40.218]  I'm just a single lady that's, you know, a Christian.
[01:44:40.978 --> 01:44:49.103]  Well, just, you'll be fine then until, you know, they want you to move a bunch of Czechoslovakian troops into your extra bedrooms.
[01:44:50.436 --> 01:44:56.019]  And then if you complain about it, well, you know, it'll be people like you that cause the nuke to go off.
[01:44:56.039 --> 01:44:59.961]  See, after the nuke goes off, after the smallpox, it's a new way of life.
[01:44:59.981 --> 01:45:01.061]  They're getting us ready for it.
[01:45:05.103 --> 01:45:11.046]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[01:47:01.711 --> 01:47:07.032]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:07.212 --> 01:47:11.674]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:11.794 --> 01:47:13.034]  There is a chance...
[01:47:13.555 --> 01:47:16.144]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[01:47:16.264 --> 01:47:17.529]  A new world order.
[01:47:19.344 --> 01:47:23.546]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:47:23.626 --> 01:47:30.550]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:47:30.670 --> 01:47:32.751]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:33.031 --> 01:47:43.497]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:47:43.697 --> 01:47:45.418]  If you want to understand what the new world order really means,
[01:47:45.438 --> 01:47:46.138]  We're good to go.
[01:47:46.158 --> 01:47:46.678]  We're good to go.
[01:48:14.406 --> 01:48:22.090]  You don't think we can have 54 million abortions and not be judged?
[01:48:22.991 --> 01:48:24.351]  I mean, let's say you don't believe in God.
[01:48:25.412 --> 01:48:37.198]  Okay, well, in a world where we rationalize and make excuses about killing 54 million human lives, budding lives, or where we already have euthanasia going on,
[01:48:37.955 --> 01:48:39.435]  You've had Wall Street Journal writers on.
[01:48:39.835 --> 01:48:44.217]  They've listed they're killing people, begging for food, begging for water.
[01:48:44.237 --> 01:48:45.237]  You didn't know about that?
[01:48:46.017 --> 01:48:46.477]  Oh, yeah.
[01:48:47.757 --> 01:48:54.279]  There's evil going on all over the place, and you think that could just go on and isn't going to affect you and your soft little life?
[01:48:55.139 --> 01:48:56.119]  Okay, you're going to pay.
[01:48:56.239 --> 01:48:57.020]  You're going to pay.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.180]  You're going to pay.
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:01.501]  And you think that just because you stay out of this, you're not going to pay.
[01:49:01.801 --> 01:49:06.862]  Oh, you're the first that are going to pay because predators eat the weak and the stupid.
[01:49:08.317 --> 01:49:09.057]  And let me tell you something.
[01:49:09.077 --> 01:49:11.739]  You're the weak and the stupid if you don't know about what's happening.
[01:49:12.099 --> 01:49:12.659]  And I'm angry.
[01:49:12.699 --> 01:49:13.179]  I'm upset.
[01:49:13.219 --> 01:49:14.200]  I'm fired up, folks.
[01:49:16.941 --> 01:49:20.843]  Let's talk to Dan, Dylan, Bill, and others.
[01:49:20.863 --> 01:49:22.104]  Dan, real quick in Illinois.
[01:49:22.144 --> 01:49:22.464]  Go ahead.
[01:49:22.484 --> 01:49:23.384]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:49:24.345 --> 01:49:24.645]  I don't know.
[01:49:24.705 --> 01:49:25.465]  How am I doing?
[01:49:25.505 --> 01:49:27.826]  I mean, do you like this ranting and raving format?
[01:49:28.347 --> 01:49:32.369]  Well, you know, I bet you there was betting going on in the Roman Colosseums.
[01:49:32.409 --> 01:49:32.829]  What do you think?
[01:49:34.048 --> 01:49:35.248]  Well, of course there was.
[01:49:35.949 --> 01:49:39.510]  How dare us be against the guys carrying out the terror and making a little money on it?
[01:49:39.790 --> 01:49:40.010]  Right.
[01:49:40.590 --> 01:49:42.771]  But I was just going to say, you were right about one thing.
[01:49:42.811 --> 01:49:43.912]  It's not stupidity.
[01:49:44.452 --> 01:49:49.874]  These people at this point in time that still support Bush, they don't care what right is.
[01:49:51.772 --> 01:49:53.294]  They don't care what's right or wrong.
[01:49:53.314 --> 01:49:54.695]  This guy can do no wrong.
[01:49:54.735 --> 01:49:56.137]  They worship him as God.
[01:49:56.157 --> 01:49:58.720]  Hey, I remember trying to wake up liberals about Clinton.
[01:49:59.281 --> 01:50:03.906]  And again, they're just puppets, but we have to expose them because people think they have this power.
[01:50:04.949 --> 01:50:06.350]  Bill Clinton's horrible.
[01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.790]  He's evil.
[01:50:06.810 --> 01:50:09.032]  He's a liar.
[01:50:09.052 --> 01:50:10.473]  I have power through him.
[01:50:10.573 --> 01:50:11.974]  Same thing with the Republicans.
[01:50:12.354 --> 01:50:13.335]  It is so pathetic.
[01:50:14.456 --> 01:50:22.961]  I think Bush could butcher a child on public television and Hannity would go out the next day and say the child deserved it.
[01:50:23.722 --> 01:50:24.743]  Bush is just a puppet.
[01:50:24.763 --> 01:50:26.044]  That's clear.
[01:50:26.064 --> 01:50:30.807]  The level of lying and the total information awareness network and
[01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:34.992]  You know, now they admit there's Patriot Act 2, and Ashcroft says you better pass it.
[01:50:35.232 --> 01:50:38.233]  The guy said over and over again for months there is no Patriot Act 2.
[01:50:38.453 --> 01:50:39.853]  You're a liar if you say it.
[01:50:40.913 --> 01:50:42.974]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:50:43.874 --> 01:50:45.374]  And they say it doesn't take your rights.
[01:50:45.835 --> 01:50:47.315]  I hear the neocons every day.
[01:50:47.795 --> 01:50:48.875]  Sweatshops are good.
[01:50:49.315 --> 01:50:50.476]  Open borders are good.
[01:50:50.496 --> 01:50:53.196]  Genetically modified food's good.
[01:50:53.456 --> 01:50:55.237]  The Patriot Act doesn't take your rights.
[01:50:58.011 --> 01:50:59.612]  They don't care what's wrong anymore.
[01:50:59.692 --> 01:51:00.853]  I'm telling you, it doesn't matter.
[01:51:00.913 --> 01:51:04.654]  As long as this administration says it, it's automatically good as if they're good.
[01:51:05.255 --> 01:51:05.955]  Thanks for the call.
[01:51:06.835 --> 01:51:07.276]  I hear you.
[01:51:07.316 --> 01:51:08.896]  I mean, the size of government's growing.
[01:51:08.956 --> 01:51:09.997]  We're losing our liberties.
[01:51:10.077 --> 01:51:11.818]  Bush is going to sign the assault weapons ban.
[01:51:12.338 --> 01:51:14.679]  And they'll say, good, good, hope he signs it.
[01:51:14.739 --> 01:51:15.780]  Good, gun control's good.
[01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:17.961]  I've had conservatives, so-called conservatives call.
[01:51:18.181 --> 01:51:21.262]  Well, so what if he bans all shotguns that are semi-automatic?
[01:51:21.522 --> 01:51:22.843]  He's got to do something.
[01:51:23.863 --> 01:51:26.204]  You people make me sick, you neocons.
[01:51:26.444 --> 01:51:28.786]  You know who you are, you pathetic jellyfish.
[01:51:30.486 --> 01:51:32.147]  You neoliberals is what you are.
[01:51:32.587 --> 01:51:35.049]  Before I end this hour again, I just throw the plug in.
[01:51:35.069 --> 01:51:36.409]  I hope you get Road to Tyranny.
[01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:38.170]  I hope you get Masters of Terror.
[01:51:38.210 --> 01:51:39.671]  I hope you get my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:51:39.691 --> 01:51:41.972]  I hope you get my videos and get them out to everybody.
[01:51:41.992 --> 01:51:49.436]  You see a different side of Alex Jones as I calmly, with the video clips and documents, go through the New World Order Master Plan and how to stop them.
[01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:53.051]  Road to Tyranny, documents who carried out September 11th.
[01:51:53.111 --> 01:51:54.072]  It's my best film.
[01:51:54.452 --> 01:51:57.613]  Got a new one out that's excellent as well, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:51:58.154 --> 01:52:04.597]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com and order the videos today.
[01:52:05.297 --> 01:52:06.518]  Do not wait, folks.
[01:52:07.238 --> 01:52:07.818]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:52:07.838 --> 01:52:08.098]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:52:19.012 --> 01:52:28.401]  3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:52:30.042 --> 01:52:34.066]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:52:34.346 --> 01:52:35.968]  So stop sitting on the bench.
[01:52:36.308 --> 01:52:39.931]  Get in the game now, or we're going to lose it all.
[01:52:39.951 --> 01:52:39.991]  888-253-3139.
[01:52:44.784 --> 01:52:46.305]  Your station doesn't carry the third hour.
[01:52:46.325 --> 01:52:47.265]  You should ask them why.
[01:52:47.886 --> 01:52:50.147]  You should sponsor them so they do carry the third hour.
[01:52:53.668 --> 01:52:56.970]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation.
[01:52:57.210 --> 01:52:59.871]  But during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:53:00.572 --> 01:53:11.637]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.277 --> 01:53:19.897]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.578 --> 01:53:21.638]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.358 --> 01:53:23.458]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.119 --> 01:53:24.919]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.679 --> 01:53:27.600]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:30.860]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.441 --> 01:53:35.542]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.042 --> 01:53:42.564]  I'm trying to keep my chin up, my chest out, my eyes open.
[01:53:43.624 --> 01:53:47.025]  It's just so crazy the stuff that's going on in our world today.
[01:53:49.384 --> 01:53:51.064]  The insanity of the corruption.
[01:53:51.684 --> 01:53:55.545]  The toll-free number to join us on air, and I'm going to take a lot of calls in this third hour.
[01:53:55.565 --> 01:53:57.266]  I know I've been going to calls kind of slow today.
[01:53:57.286 --> 01:53:57.346]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:57.366 --> 01:53:58.206]  800-259-9231.
[01:53:58.326 --> 01:53:58.666]  Listen to this.
[01:53:58.686 --> 01:54:01.727]  Officials pleased with initial results of bioterrorism tests.
[01:54:01.747 --> 01:54:02.827]  Channel 5, Oklahoma.
[01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:16.662]  Then I have the Homeland Security Press release.
[01:54:16.783 --> 01:54:18.964]  Oklahoma City hosts largest U.S.
[01:54:19.064 --> 01:54:26.370]  urban atmospheric study as they sprayed gases in Subtilis, Rosilis, or Rosilis-Subtilis.
[01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:34.896]  Also, cutoff for Un-American Activities, the mobile phone firm that connected Iraqis about how they only allow globalist firms in the country.
[01:54:36.557 --> 01:54:39.559]  DARPA has announced a new hover drone to watch us all in our cities.
[01:54:39.599 --> 01:54:40.400]  Look, it's all coming up.
[01:54:41.774 --> 01:54:42.375]  It's all coming up.
[01:54:42.415 --> 01:54:43.075]  I'm going to get to it.
[01:54:43.095 --> 01:54:44.636]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:54:45.157 --> 01:54:46.158]  Dylan in Texas.
[01:54:46.258 --> 01:54:47.238]  Dylan, you're on the air.
[01:54:47.278 --> 01:54:47.619]  Welcome.
[01:54:48.659 --> 01:54:49.440]  Hi, Alex.
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:50.421]  How are you doing today?
[01:54:51.041 --> 01:54:51.521]  Pretty good.
[01:54:52.122 --> 01:54:54.764]  I'm trying to get the word out here.
[01:54:55.504 --> 01:54:57.866]  I'm doing exactly what you do on a smaller scale.
[01:54:58.867 --> 01:55:04.951]  And in the past, I voted for Bill Clinton for various reasons.
[01:55:05.071 --> 01:55:06.952]  And it wasn't because I thought he was a good guy.
[01:55:06.972 --> 01:55:10.375]  It's because I thought he was the less
[01:55:11.124 --> 01:55:18.167]  The less bad of the crooks, you know, and eventually I just found out, well, he's just as bad as everyone else.
[01:55:18.608 --> 01:55:20.148]  Yeah, they're just puppets.
[01:55:20.188 --> 01:55:21.549]  They're not running anything.
[01:55:21.929 --> 01:55:24.511]  Bush, Clinton, they're all business partners in MENA.
[01:55:24.831 --> 01:55:25.811]  It's totally staged.
[01:55:26.672 --> 01:55:35.616]  Well, I would like to address the educated viewers out there, specifically people who might be inclined to go look up laws on the Internet.
[01:55:36.877 --> 01:55:46.562]  A lot of things that our good man Alex here talks about, such like the Patriot Act, if you go and try and look that up, you're going to need the real words for it.
[01:55:46.643 --> 01:55:47.863]  Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[01:55:47.943 --> 01:55:49.344]  Patriot Act 1 is a law.
[01:55:50.184 --> 01:56:00.110]  The title of it is to deter and punish terrorist acts in the United States and around the world to enhance law enforcement investigatory tools and for other purposes.
[01:56:00.130 --> 01:56:02.491]  And if you can't remember all that, it's H.R.
[01:56:03.086 --> 01:56:04.087]  HR 3162.
[01:56:04.307 --> 01:56:06.729]  HR 3162 is law right now.
[01:56:07.409 --> 01:56:12.513]  Patriot Act 2, which is a bill at this time, you can't find that.
[01:56:12.633 --> 01:56:16.616]  If you try to look it up, Library of Congress, Patriot Act 2, you won't find it.
[01:56:16.636 --> 01:56:19.397]  You've got to look up Center for... I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:56:19.438 --> 01:56:25.762]  You've got to look up... Domestic Security Enhancement Act in the House and the Justice Domestic Security Enhancement Act in the Senate.
[01:56:26.583 --> 01:56:26.803]  Mm-hmm.
[01:56:27.083 --> 01:56:30.685]  And the one link to that is S-22 is one of the...
[01:56:33.456 --> 01:56:35.498]  A number you can look it up as, S22.
[01:56:36.158 --> 01:56:45.446]  And if you do have the time, and if you do are inclined, for those intelligent listeners out there, I have this stuff printed up.
[01:56:45.686 --> 01:56:51.450]  You just need a Bill of Rights sitting next to you, and you need this Patriot Act sitting next to you.
[01:56:54.633 --> 01:56:57.195]  You can clearly see, and that's how you find it.
[01:56:57.215 --> 01:56:58.276]  You just got to know the name.
[01:56:58.296 --> 01:57:00.838]  You mean actually read the Bill of Rights instead of...
[01:57:01.613 --> 01:57:03.915]  Instead of swilling beer at a football game?
[01:57:04.695 --> 01:57:07.637]  You mean actually caring about your children's future?
[01:57:08.378 --> 01:57:14.723]  The nice thing is you can compare this socialist legislation, socialist, fascist, totalitarian, whatever you want to call it.
[01:57:14.743 --> 01:57:15.623]  Demand and control.
[01:57:15.703 --> 01:57:19.366]  It doesn't support our constitutional republic here.
[01:57:19.826 --> 01:57:24.510]  You can find the Bill of Rights on Google, but remember that H...
[01:57:25.888 --> 01:57:26.088]  H.R.
[01:57:26.368 --> 01:57:26.088]  3162.
[01:57:26.548 --> 01:57:27.609]  It's Patriot Act 1.
[01:57:27.869 --> 01:57:28.350]  That's law.
[01:57:28.490 --> 01:57:28.770]  H.R.
[01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.770]  3162.
[01:57:28.930 --> 01:57:47.448]  If folks go to InfoWars.com, we have an analysis of Patriot Act 1 written in October of 2001, and we have an analysis written in January of this year on Patriot Act 2 with all the pertinent subsections where you can download both bills.
[01:57:48.988 --> 01:57:53.970]  I mean, they've been getting away with stuff for years in secret, and it's been illegal activities.
[01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:58.092]  But now they have the laws in place almost totally now.
[01:57:58.592 --> 01:58:01.894]  Are folks you're talking to, Dylan, waking up?
[01:58:03.474 --> 01:58:11.958]  When I show them the documents, if they have time at all, emotional reserve at all, to listen or read any of the documents, they can help it.
[01:58:11.978 --> 01:58:12.158]  Yep.
[01:58:14.722 --> 01:58:22.964]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:58:23.224 --> 01:58:27.585]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:58:27.865 --> 01:58:36.787]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:58:36.987 --> 01:58:40.608]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:58:40.908 --> 01:58:45.953]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:58:46.233 --> 01:58:52.940]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:58:53.433 --> 01:58:54.093]  What about you?
[01:58:54.754 --> 01:59:00.097]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:59:14.265 --> 01:59:18.609]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:18.789 --> 01:59:23.212]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:23.372 --> 01:59:27.756]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:59:27.796 --> 01:59:29.137]  The New World Order.
[01:59:30.931 --> 01:59:35.134]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:35.214 --> 01:59:42.140]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:44.321]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:44.662 --> 01:59:55.090]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:55.290 --> 01:59:57.992]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[01:59:58.012 --> 01:59:59.193]  888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word.
[02:00:13.590 --> 02:00:14.590]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:17.131]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:00:17.231 --> 02:00:17.971]  You heard that right.
[02:00:18.031 --> 02:00:20.512]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:00:20.652 --> 02:00:21.592]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:00:21.853 --> 02:00:23.153]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:00:23.393 --> 02:00:24.933]  Now is the time to fight back.
[02:00:25.174 --> 02:00:27.954]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[02:00:28.134 --> 02:00:31.816]  The procedure's easy, and everything is done legally and within the law.
[02:00:32.036 --> 02:00:33.416]  Almost no one has ever failed.
[02:00:33.596 --> 02:00:34.297]  We're good to go.
[02:00:57.073 --> 02:01:06.735]  1-2-3-NoDebt.com Come over and get our rock-solid technology that waves out debt without bankruptcy.
[02:01:06.755 --> 02:01:09.335]  1-2-3-NoDebt.com Live debt-free now.
[02:01:09.676 --> 02:01:11.456]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[02:01:15.677 --> 02:01:17.777]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:01:18.337 --> 02:01:21.138]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:23.468 --> 02:01:29.773]  All right, my friends, we're back live, already 8 minutes and 12 seconds into this third hour.
[02:01:30.674 --> 02:01:31.654]  Let's go to your calls.
[02:01:31.834 --> 02:01:33.836]  Bill in Alaska, you're on the air.
[02:01:33.876 --> 02:01:34.476]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:01:35.257 --> 02:01:35.978]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:01:36.718 --> 02:01:39.800]  I was just sitting here and thought I'd call you.
[02:01:40.141 --> 02:01:42.863]  Page 2 in World Net Daily, U.S.
[02:01:42.943 --> 02:01:47.106]  prepares to open the door to a flood of North Korean refugees.
[02:01:48.854 --> 02:01:49.054]  About 300,000.
[02:01:49.214 --> 02:01:55.419]  I guess they're going to take the troops over there and on the way back keep the ships from being empty.
[02:01:55.439 --> 02:01:58.901]  You know, we're going to pick up terrorists from North Korea and bring them over here.
[02:01:58.961 --> 02:02:00.042]  Is that the way that's going to work?
[02:02:00.402 --> 02:02:02.224]  Hey, there's billions of people.
[02:02:02.244 --> 02:02:03.304]  They're all coming here.
[02:02:03.544 --> 02:02:06.246]  And North Korea will be a good citizen on their homeland.
[02:02:06.266 --> 02:02:11.530]  They're used to black ski masks and cameras and secret arrests and FEMA centers.
[02:02:11.590 --> 02:02:13.932]  I mean, happy clown candy centers.
[02:02:15.833 --> 02:02:23.739]  We ought to at least have an equal number of troops staying here, you know, just in case these guys ain't who they present themselves.
[02:02:23.839 --> 02:02:27.722]  Oh, no, it's very safe to have North Koreans here.
[02:02:27.762 --> 02:02:31.384]  I mean, every time they catch one of their police boats, everybody commits suicide.
[02:02:31.444 --> 02:02:32.785]  I mean, they're totally mind-controlled.
[02:02:32.845 --> 02:02:34.867]  Hey, hey, hey, look.
[02:02:34.987 --> 02:02:36.168]  I've got the article.
[02:02:36.508 --> 02:02:37.529]  The North Koreans are coming.
[02:02:37.549 --> 02:02:38.009]  That's fine.
[02:02:38.049 --> 02:02:38.870]  But just don't worry.
[02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:40.411]  You and your family...
[02:02:41.252 --> 02:02:44.456]  Well, it sounds like their support, we've got to support their invasion of our nation, brother.
[02:02:58.767 --> 02:02:59.828]  I'm going to let you go, Alex.
[02:02:59.988 --> 02:03:11.252]  Well, hey, your conservative legislature threw out the Patriot Act, and Lord Ashcroft visited and said, yeah, there is a Patriot Act, too, and you better pass it or there's going to be terrorism.
[02:03:11.332 --> 02:03:12.593]  Sounds like a threat to me.
[02:03:13.093 --> 02:03:13.513]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:13.533 --> 02:03:18.195]  So what do you want to say to Mr. Ashcroft?
[02:03:19.696 --> 02:03:20.796]  He ought to get honest work.
[02:03:22.794 --> 02:03:25.717]  But he's posing as a Christian while destroying America.
[02:03:25.737 --> 02:03:29.120]  That's got to be a lot of fun for someone like himself.
[02:03:31.222 --> 02:03:33.784]  You can teach a parrot to say Jesus is Lord, brother.
[02:03:33.804 --> 02:03:36.967]  You've got to believe it in your heart, and he don't show no evidence of that.
[02:03:37.288 --> 02:03:40.170]  Well, you don't like this rotten fruit growing off the tree?
[02:03:41.431 --> 02:03:42.072]  No, sir, I don't.
[02:03:42.693 --> 02:03:46.336]  You know, it's a tree that's got rotten dead bodies hanging off of it.
[02:03:47.583 --> 02:03:49.209]  I mean, we judge a tree by its fruit.
[02:03:49.229 --> 02:03:51.116]  Look at the cess pouring out of Washington.
[02:03:51.497 --> 02:03:52.320]  Isn't that a good thing?
[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:53.022]  Isn't that wholesome?
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:56.901]  Well, it's a shame to the whole nation.
[02:03:57.121 --> 02:04:02.822]  I mean, the people won't rise up to do anything about it, and they get the leaders they deserve.
[02:04:02.882 --> 02:04:17.646]  But, I mean, isn't it conservative to have open borders and to sign assault weapons bans, to say he'll sign them, and to give supercomputers to China and block Dan Burton's committee investigating Pardon Gate and to have a betting pool on dead American soldiers?
[02:04:17.987 --> 02:04:19.267]  I mean, isn't that patriotic?
[02:04:20.107 --> 02:04:23.068]  It's a testimony to the ignorance of the masses.
[02:04:24.190 --> 02:04:26.231]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:04:26.871 --> 02:04:30.053]  The communist flag, the red star, is conservative.
[02:04:31.113 --> 02:04:35.095]  And the founding fathers were evil liberals.
[02:04:35.435 --> 02:04:35.856]  Okay?
[02:04:36.496 --> 02:04:38.757]  So I'm beginning to learn how to be a neocon, all right?
[02:04:38.777 --> 02:04:40.838]  Thanks for the call.
[02:04:41.378 --> 02:04:41.758]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:42.099 --> 02:04:51.143]  There's a big article today, mainstream, saying, yeah, the neocons really do follow Hitler, Trotsky, and Machiavelli.
[02:04:52.509 --> 02:04:56.392]  Yeah, and they do believe in socialism, big government, and abortion.
[02:04:56.552 --> 02:04:59.234]  That's what the neocons believe.
[02:04:59.614 --> 02:05:01.455]  And that's who runs talk radio.
[02:05:02.916 --> 02:05:08.640]  They tell you a little of what you want to hear and then distract you off into Hillary Clinton and what an idiot she is, which we already know.
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:10.841]  And then, meanwhile, Bush or America.
[02:05:11.802 --> 02:05:19.587]  There's an endless stream of morons to call in and thank the host for how loving and conservative they are.
[02:05:20.605 --> 02:05:21.305]  What a joke.
[02:05:21.766 --> 02:05:24.127]  Let's talk to Lewis in Rhode Island.
[02:05:24.167 --> 02:05:24.967]  Go ahead, Lewis.
[02:05:27.388 --> 02:05:28.509]  Yeah, hi.
[02:05:28.989 --> 02:05:35.031]  I wanted to be a caller before concerning the camps.
[02:05:35.872 --> 02:05:46.617]  I want to say, during World War II, there were thousands of Italian-Americans that were put in these camps.
[02:05:48.581 --> 02:05:54.423]  Joe DiMaggio's father in the West Coast had his fishing fleet taken from him.
[02:05:56.404 --> 02:06:06.467]  The opera singer Enzio Pinza was put in a camp here in Rhode Island.
[02:06:07.968 --> 02:06:13.230]  The government came in and took flashlight radios in New York City.
[02:06:15.351 --> 02:06:16.231]  Registration at
[02:06:17.264 --> 02:06:18.945]  Police stations were required.
[02:06:20.286 --> 02:06:23.707]  Restricted travel.
[02:06:23.787 --> 02:06:28.310]  About 640,000 were slated for these camps.
[02:06:28.570 --> 02:06:34.473]  You know, I actually saw a little piece on that on the History Channel about how it wasn't just the Japanese.
[02:06:36.974 --> 02:06:47.019]  Again, but what they're setting up today is for everybody, and it's for good, and it's secret execution, so it's even worse than what you're talking about, but
[02:06:48.242 --> 02:06:52.065]  Yeah, as if Italians or Japanese were going to do something.
[02:06:52.105 --> 02:06:55.567]  I mean, in hindsight, it's obvious how ridiculous it was.
[02:06:56.168 --> 02:06:59.370]  But go ahead and continue.
[02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:13.519]  So ridiculous that throughout World War II and after, not one Italian, Italian-American was convicted for any act of espionage whatsoever.
[02:07:13.539 --> 02:07:14.259]  Right.
[02:07:16.109 --> 02:07:25.577]  Japanese may have been the same, but anyone I tell this to says, oh, well, you know, that's interesting.
[02:07:26.017 --> 02:07:26.678]  Interesting?
[02:07:27.038 --> 02:07:35.685]  I mean, people were put in camps for no reason other than what the government wanted to control.
[02:07:36.045 --> 02:07:37.266]  But here's the difference.
[02:07:39.288 --> 02:07:40.829]  Here's the difference, and it was wrong.
[02:07:41.650 --> 02:07:42.090]  Stupid.
[02:07:43.031 --> 02:07:44.032]  But here's the difference.
[02:07:46.494 --> 02:07:49.977]  You can be secretly executed.
[02:08:15.473 --> 02:08:22.217]  So now they're setting up a huge infrastructure for millions of people.
[02:08:23.077 --> 02:08:25.218]  And, folks, there's not millions of Muslims in this country.
[02:08:25.499 --> 02:08:26.559]  It's not just for the Muslims.
[02:08:26.819 --> 02:08:27.640]  And that's bad enough.
[02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:28.940]  Most Muslims aren't a problem.
[02:08:30.261 --> 02:08:32.042]  So it's scary.
[02:08:32.322 --> 02:08:41.947]  And they have that poll in New York about, in the Associated Press, how many people think that all Arabs should be put in camps.
[02:08:42.976 --> 02:08:45.678]  And the majority of women said yes.
[02:08:45.778 --> 02:08:48.099]  It was like 52%.
[02:08:48.179 --> 02:08:50.300]  About 35% of men said it.
[02:08:51.261 --> 02:08:52.201]  It was what Hitler said.
[02:08:52.241 --> 02:08:54.303]  He said women were perfect for the police state.
[02:08:54.343 --> 02:08:57.064]  Man, in the name of security, they'll do anything.
[02:08:58.685 --> 02:09:00.386]  Now, I'm not saying women are dumb or anything.
[02:09:00.446 --> 02:09:04.508]  It's just that they are easily sucked in by dictators historically.
[02:09:05.089 --> 02:09:06.970]  And not all women, but on average.
[02:09:07.854 --> 02:09:10.835]  And so they've had polls about putting people in camps.
[02:09:10.895 --> 02:09:19.159]  And believe me, in an atmosphere where they just grab people and put them in camps, they're setting it up to just go downhill from there.
[02:09:20.519 --> 02:09:23.121]  They've been building this for decades, Lewis.
[02:09:25.622 --> 02:09:35.046]  This can be seen on the website Storia, S-T-O-R-I-A, Segreta, S-E-G-R-E-T-A.
[02:09:36.485 --> 02:09:38.586]  That means secret story in Italian.
[02:09:39.447 --> 02:09:51.333]  And storyofsegretta.com, for those who think that this is not a reality, they can look at it and see very clearly what the story is.
[02:09:52.433 --> 02:09:52.793]  That's it.
[02:09:54.014 --> 02:09:54.374]  All right.
[02:09:54.394 --> 02:09:55.155]  Thanks for the call.
[02:09:55.935 --> 02:10:03.839]  Let me just tell the listeners now who the FBI and FEMA have been trained is the real group to be arrested.
[02:10:05.151 --> 02:10:09.253]  On the news, they will show Muslims and Arabs and guys with big beards being arrested.
[02:10:10.413 --> 02:10:18.216]  But the FEMA training, the roundup list, is for gun-owning Christian patriots.
[02:10:19.817 --> 02:10:22.898]  And we have FEMA on tape before police officers.
[02:10:23.559 --> 02:10:28.941]  And this has been radically expanded by Bush, saying, quote, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson are terrorists.
[02:10:30.672 --> 02:10:31.713]  We're good to go.
[02:10:31.793 --> 02:10:32.134]  I think?
[02:10:55.090 --> 02:11:02.497]  Once you get real tyranny going, it's like the Nazis, or speaking of Italy, Mussolini.
[02:11:03.918 --> 02:11:13.267]  They spent most of their time taking people's businesses, taking people's wives, taking people's farms, taking people's restaurants, taking people's mines.
[02:11:14.388 --> 02:11:15.229]  This is what they do.
[02:11:16.767 --> 02:11:18.107]  And we already see it.
[02:11:18.167 --> 02:11:31.950]  I mean, you've got the local corrupt cities that are stealing land and doing sweetheart deals and skimming money, and so they don't care what the feds do, and you're going to have that same degenerate fat cat mayor in there under this system, and he's going to love it.
[02:11:32.010 --> 02:11:32.810]  They want tyranny.
[02:11:34.731 --> 02:11:46.193]  And that's why they're making it where you can't get in to see your city council people while they're armored compounds, while you don't have citizens communication anymore, while they're shutting down access TV, while they're buying up all the radio and networks.
[02:11:48.132 --> 02:11:49.692]  They want unified corruption.
[02:11:49.732 --> 02:11:51.133]  They're doing it right now, folks.
[02:11:52.233 --> 02:11:56.254]  And the government is run by totally ruthless people that think nothing of you and your family.
[02:11:57.434 --> 02:12:00.295]  And they don't care about the economy or our way of life.
[02:12:00.395 --> 02:12:03.096]  They just want to sit up on top of the heap.
[02:12:04.236 --> 02:12:05.396]  They want total control.
[02:12:05.496 --> 02:12:06.197]  They want it now.
[02:12:06.657 --> 02:12:09.057]  That's why they're in the positions of power they're in.
[02:12:09.337 --> 02:12:10.478]  Because they are ruthless.
[02:12:10.538 --> 02:12:11.818]  Because they have that desire.
[02:12:12.078 --> 02:12:13.758]  Because they're sadistic.
[02:12:14.179 --> 02:12:15.559]  They enjoy it.
[02:12:17.931 --> 02:12:18.632]  We're good to go.
[02:12:32.242 --> 02:12:38.667]  Who has no idea about your history, no idea about the world, no idea about what America really is.
[02:12:39.127 --> 02:12:48.174]  So now the tyrants can wrap themselves in the flag and say, give your liberty up or you're against the flag when the flag symbolizes the liberty and freedoms.
[02:12:50.596 --> 02:12:51.556]  I got a bunch of callers.
[02:12:52.777 --> 02:13:00.303]  Jim and Chris and who's that caller in Pennsylvania?
[02:13:01.531 --> 02:13:02.332]  And well and others.
[02:13:03.153 --> 02:13:05.415]  I'm going to get to you guys in about 15 minutes, okay?
[02:13:05.495 --> 02:13:08.498]  I've got to come back and just cover some news because there's a bunch of it here.
[02:13:08.518 --> 02:13:12.041]  I'm going to cover this first, then we'll go to your calls.
[02:13:12.121 --> 02:13:13.042]  Just stay with me.
[02:13:15.024 --> 02:13:18.907]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:13:19.148 --> 02:13:24.592]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:13:24.872 --> 02:13:35.241]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:13:35.401 --> 02:13:39.744]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:13:39.924 --> 02:13:40.705]  Try Halo Methane.
[02:13:41.005 --> 02:13:48.269]  And volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:13:48.549 --> 02:13:54.932]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:13:55.032 --> 02:13:59.514]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[02:14:51.650 --> 02:14:52.311]  We're good to go.
[02:15:13.917 --> 02:15:18.158]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[02:15:18.599 --> 02:15:23.140]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:28.402]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[02:15:28.762 --> 02:15:30.562]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[02:15:30.602 --> 02:15:31.623]  can barely be read.
[02:15:31.923 --> 02:15:32.863]  It has faded that much.
[02:15:33.243 --> 02:15:37.144]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[02:15:37.404 --> 02:15:45.767]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.

[02:16:08.064 --> 02:16:08.564]  The number 800-686-2237.
[02:16:13.331 --> 02:16:15.873]  Hey gang, it's time for a fresh, healthy start.

[02:17:06.656 --> 02:17:06.716]  1-800-622-8446.
[02:17:10.317 --> 02:17:11.978]  Easy way to remember it, 1-800-622-THEN.
[02:17:11.998 --> 02:17:28.466]  Folks, we forget about the news that's been out there.
[02:17:28.626 --> 02:17:34.069]  Public schools all over the place are putting cameras everywhere, including dressing rooms of...
[02:17:40.377 --> 02:17:46.002]  Middle school students.
[02:17:48.044 --> 02:17:52.528]  The Bill of Rights and Constitution are on fire.
[02:17:53.088 --> 02:17:56.771]  The Republic is under massive attack.
[02:17:58.233 --> 02:17:59.474]  But here's some good news.
[02:17:59.494 --> 02:18:00.415]  This is out of the L.A.
[02:18:00.475 --> 02:18:06.560]  Times, planned sequel to Patriot Act, losing audience of congressional critics of the sneak and peek searches.
[02:18:07.228 --> 02:18:12.251]  Gain ground, the Justice Department may shelve requests for expanded powers.
[02:18:12.311 --> 02:18:18.795]  Now, again, I have Ashcroft on video in Police State 3 saying there is no Patriot Act 2.
[02:18:18.915 --> 02:18:21.636]  If you say it, you're a liar, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:18:21.656 --> 02:18:24.698]  He actually says, you're aiding the terrorists, you'll lose your liberty.
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:29.962]  Six weeks after September 11th attacks, Representative C.L.
[02:18:30.082 --> 02:18:37.225]  Bunch, Otter of Idaho, was a lone wolf, arguing Attorney General Ashcroft didn't need more power to fight homegrown terrorists.
[02:18:38.145 --> 02:18:40.326]  Otter was the only member of Congress to argue against the U.S.
[02:18:40.346 --> 02:18:43.948]  Patriot Act, and the terrorist-fighting law was debated on the House floor.
[02:18:44.588 --> 02:18:47.109]  These days, the Republican has plenty of company.
[02:18:47.169 --> 02:18:49.410]  Now, we need to get Otter on.
[02:18:50.111 --> 02:18:50.711]  Circle that.
[02:18:52.296 --> 02:18:54.359]  Otter was the only member of Congress to argue against the U.S.
[02:18:54.379 --> 02:18:58.123]  Patriot Act when terrorism fighting law was debated on the House floor.
[02:18:58.643 --> 02:19:07.333]  These days, the Republican has plenty of company, and the Justice Department, which in recent months has drafted a measure that would expand its powers, may be on the retreat.
[02:19:07.413 --> 02:19:08.014]  Oh, don't worry.
[02:19:08.054 --> 02:19:12.880]  They've got terrorists ready to launch attacks right now, so they can be our saviors.
[02:19:13.613 --> 02:19:23.417]  Last week, the House overwhelmingly passed a measure that would repeal a portion of the Patriot Act, which has been passed while the rubble at the Pentagon and World Trade Center is still smoldered.
[02:19:23.457 --> 02:19:28.019]  Yeah, and the Capitol was under CIA anthrax attack, by the way.
[02:19:29.059 --> 02:19:30.040]  That's a fact, by the way.
[02:19:30.820 --> 02:19:38.523]  The so-called Otter Amendment would take away federal investigations' power to conduct sneak and peek searches, unannounced searches of homes and businesses.
[02:19:39.399 --> 02:19:41.982]  Yeah, they're allowed to plant stuff, take stuff.
[02:19:42.622 --> 02:19:45.305]  If you catch them, you're not allowed to tell anybody they were ever there.
[02:19:45.365 --> 02:19:46.746]  You can, quote, be executed.
[02:19:46.766 --> 02:19:58.117]  The measure would be a small adjustment to the Patriot Act, but it indicates a growing belief among lawmakers that some investigators have abused their new powers and need to be held more strictly accountable.
[02:19:58.883 --> 02:20:06.608]  The Justice Department just said a month ago before Congress that they're going to use it in all crimes and all misdemeanors in stuff unrelated to terror.
[02:20:07.088 --> 02:20:09.089]  See, we told you that's how it's written.
[02:20:09.109 --> 02:20:19.035]  Folks, if you got $3,000 out of a bank under Patriot Act I, you could be grabbed off the street, put in a van, and never seen again.
[02:20:21.436 --> 02:20:26.179]  Whenever the final fate of the Otter Amendment, the Justice Department has voiced strong objections to the measure, declaring it
[02:20:27.463 --> 02:20:29.064]  The terrorist tip-off amendment.
[02:20:29.664 --> 02:20:31.565]  Oh, no, no, it's not going to tip you off.
[02:20:31.585 --> 02:20:32.505]  Don't worry, terrorists.
[02:20:33.106 --> 02:20:41.629]  In a letter to House Speaker Jay Dennis Hastert last week, no comparable measure has been introduced in the Senate, although proponents hope it finds a sponsor soon.
[02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:49.513]  So, Justice Department, how are all the cash bonuses for those of you that stopped the FBI from stopping al-Qaeda?
[02:20:50.906 --> 02:20:58.971]  Tell us, Justice Department, how you paid for the houses and credit cards and cars of the hijackers and how most of them have been found still alive.
[02:21:00.852 --> 02:21:06.515]  Why don't you tell us about how you had warnings not to fly to New York that day, Ashcroft, or to MSNBC?
[02:21:07.075 --> 02:21:08.476]  Hey, I'll tell you what, Ashcroft.
[02:21:09.317 --> 02:21:11.198]  Why don't you tell us how you tried to pass...
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:13.541]  The sneak and peek provision in 1999.
[02:21:14.502 --> 02:21:15.723]  I covered it on this show.
[02:21:16.163 --> 02:21:22.528]  Why don't you tell us how you're an un-American socialist posing as a conservative?
[02:21:23.549 --> 02:21:24.850]  You bug-eyed criminal.
[02:21:26.191 --> 02:21:27.652]  We're sick and tired of you.
[02:21:28.312 --> 02:21:29.213]  You're a liar.
[02:21:29.273 --> 02:21:30.754]  You've lied before Congress.
[02:21:31.795 --> 02:21:32.716]  That's criminal.
[02:21:33.496 --> 02:21:36.979]  That's what your little buddy Poindexter was convicted of.
[02:21:39.494 --> 02:21:42.735]  That's what your little buddy Poindexter was convicted of.
[02:21:43.615 --> 02:21:47.616]  And now he runs the betting parlor on how many of our troops are going to die.
[02:21:48.036 --> 02:21:56.638]  And by the way, that just legitimizes insider trading right out in full view, which the CIA did on 9-1-1, making a little side profit.
[02:21:56.918 --> 02:21:59.018]  You guys do everything right out in plain view.
[02:21:59.278 --> 02:22:00.578]  You guys are so sick.
[02:22:01.559 --> 02:22:03.659]  Some of us see exactly what you are.
[02:22:03.719 --> 02:22:08.500]  You lying, gun-grabbing, church-seizing,
[02:22:09.321 --> 02:22:10.082]  Devils!
[02:22:13.046 --> 02:22:13.606]  It goes on.
[02:22:13.626 --> 02:22:19.494]  In a speech earlier this month, however, Otter was generally optimistic, telling business community leaders, in Boise, things are looking up.
[02:22:19.734 --> 02:22:21.857]  Boise, the most conservative state out there.
[02:22:23.479 --> 02:22:24.260]  Boise, Idaho.
[02:22:25.615 --> 02:22:28.216]  Idaho, the most conservative state, and they're against the bill.
[02:22:28.576 --> 02:22:31.196]  Yeah, they're the type of conservatives that believe in the Second Amendment.
[02:22:31.477 --> 02:22:33.377]  They're the type that believe in controlling the border.
[02:22:33.677 --> 02:22:35.357]  They're the type that read bills.
[02:22:35.658 --> 02:22:48.581]  They're not the fly-by-night, easy-going, idiot Bush-Cheney supporter with a stupid sticker on the car who don't understand that Bush is the ultimate big government Trojan horse wrecking machine.
[02:22:50.401 --> 02:22:51.041]  I got more.
[02:22:51.141 --> 02:22:51.862]  I got a lot more.
[02:22:51.882 --> 02:22:52.722]  And we'll go to your calls.
[02:22:52.762 --> 02:22:53.122]  We'll go to...
[02:22:54.418 --> 02:23:00.822]  Jim and many others, many others that are holding.
[02:23:00.842 --> 02:23:01.182]  800-259-9231.
[02:23:01.202 --> 02:23:03.843]  Stay with me.
[02:23:05.124 --> 02:23:06.025]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.525 --> 02:23:08.126]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.046 --> 02:23:11.728]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.226 --> 02:23:19.128]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:23:19.328 --> 02:23:24.791]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:23:25.072 --> 02:23:28.774]  Ideal for big bucks on the items you and your family use every day.

[02:23:40.834 --> 02:23:42.715]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:43.215 --> 02:23:46.036]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:49.718 --> 02:23:50.258]  All right.
[02:23:50.938 --> 02:23:54.159]  Jim, Manuel, Chris, and others, your calls are coming up.
[02:23:54.219 --> 02:23:55.660]  Let me get back into some of this news.
[02:23:57.421 --> 02:23:58.481]  Again, just recapping.
[02:23:58.641 --> 02:24:05.124]  Ottawa tries to rein in joyriders with satellite kill boxes and special keys by law.
[02:24:06.184 --> 02:24:08.005]  DW Deutsch News.
[02:24:09.247 --> 02:24:15.854]  Satellite tracker boxes going in the trucks by law to travel on the roads, and they're doing it right here in the U.S., moving ahead with that.
[02:24:15.874 --> 02:24:16.936]  I don't know.
[02:24:16.976 --> 02:24:27.848]  You might be involved in the political process and say, no, you don't need any more tax money, and no, you're not going to violate my Fourth Amendment and tax me to drive my car any more than you already are.
[02:24:30.342 --> 02:24:31.543]  It's just one of my pet peeves.
[02:24:31.583 --> 02:24:34.045]  It's a key area of the globalist infrastructure.
[02:24:34.546 --> 02:24:44.595]  Of course, it's wildly unpopular with those that are informed about it, but the problem is the average person won't know about it until they pass the law, which Oregon's about to do.
[02:24:46.357 --> 02:24:50.241]  Congress zeroes in on Poindexter over terror futures flap.
[02:24:51.258 --> 02:25:00.510]  As Congress continues looking into the just-killed Pentagon project to create a futures market for speculating on possible terrorist acts in the U.S.
[02:25:00.530 --> 02:25:04.054]  and overseas, a key question on many legislators' minds is this.
[02:25:04.455 --> 02:25:06.177]  Was John Poindexter involved?
[02:25:06.197 --> 02:25:07.399]  Well, he's the head of DARPA.
[02:25:08.519 --> 02:25:21.883]  For the naval officer who was a major figure in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 80s, a convicted felon, controversy has been a companion since he joined a Defense Department research agency after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
[02:25:23.443 --> 02:25:24.843]  It visited again this week.
[02:25:24.883 --> 02:25:30.445]  We believe that he was responsible for it, said Senator Byron Dorgan, one of the senators who's
[02:25:31.374 --> 02:25:37.399]  Revelation of the program led to its demise, said yesterday, but we've asked for an investigation.
[02:25:37.439 --> 02:25:42.963]  We're asking the Pentagon to explain to us who was accountable, who was responsible.
[02:25:43.123 --> 02:25:49.348]  I think those who are responsible for doing this ought to be on the public, shouldn't be on the public payroll.
[02:25:49.508 --> 02:25:50.849]  Oh, he'll get a raise, don't worry.
[02:25:52.518 --> 02:26:07.997]  At a hearing Tuesday on Iraq, Senator Bill Nelson said Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz would identify who was responsible for the proposed policy analysis market in which traders would speculate on the possibility of terrorists and other actions in the Middle East.
[02:26:08.618 --> 02:26:10.861]  Uh-uh, we got the site before they got rid of it.
[02:26:11.834 --> 02:26:12.915]  And it's been in the news.
[02:26:12.955 --> 02:26:13.835]  It was about the U.S.
[02:26:13.875 --> 02:26:15.856]  getting nuked, how many troops would die.
[02:26:16.437 --> 02:26:18.178]  But again, it's not about predicting.
[02:26:18.238 --> 02:26:22.660]  It's so these globalists can speculate on the terror attacks they're going to launch.
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:26.182]  The 66-year-old retired admiral who served...
[02:26:27.108 --> 02:26:37.432]  As a national security advisor, I was at the center of a storm where critics began to focus on his data mining project called Total Information Awareness late last year.
[02:26:37.452 --> 02:26:40.554]  The program later renamed Terrorism Information Awareness.
[02:26:40.574 --> 02:26:46.596]  It involves a massive effort to analyze vast volumes of data on individuals in search of terrorists.
[02:26:46.676 --> 02:26:47.357]  Look in the mirror.
[02:26:47.377 --> 02:26:47.957]  You'll find them.
[02:26:50.533 --> 02:26:51.534]  Oh, it goes on and on.
[02:26:51.654 --> 02:26:53.836]  Poindexter brought the idea to the Defense Department.
[02:26:54.156 --> 02:26:56.178]  Poindexter is the scapegoat.
[02:26:56.618 --> 02:26:58.159]  They've had Echelon for decades.
[02:26:58.199 --> 02:27:01.262]  They've been betting on the terror they carry out for decades.
[02:27:02.203 --> 02:27:04.044]  They control the speculation markets.
[02:27:04.064 --> 02:27:05.766]  That's how the globalists manipulate things.
[02:27:07.047 --> 02:27:09.809]  It's always Ashcroft is why we have Patriot Actor.
[02:27:10.069 --> 02:27:11.991]  It's Poindexter or it's Bush.
[02:27:12.471 --> 02:27:15.974]  They're just little snot-nosed puppets.
[02:27:17.105 --> 02:27:18.786]  That's all they are.
[02:27:19.166 --> 02:27:20.947]  That's all they'll ever be.
[02:27:22.687 --> 02:27:24.648]  They're just front men for this whole thing.
[02:27:24.728 --> 02:27:27.529]  But yeah, Poindexter is a real piece of work, folks.
[02:27:27.609 --> 02:27:28.369]  Real piece of work.
[02:27:28.409 --> 02:27:28.910]  Listen to this.
[02:27:29.430 --> 02:27:31.491]  Biometric passports coming soon.
[02:27:31.511 --> 02:27:35.532]  Countries scrambling to meet 2004 deadline for the UN.
[02:27:35.552 --> 02:27:40.094]  And don't worry, we're the first to comply before Russia or China does.
[02:27:40.569 --> 02:27:45.873]  Face scan, thumb scan on your passport to leave your country as part of the new global system.
[02:27:45.913 --> 02:27:49.815]  And, of course, there'll be a little tax on it to help fund the U.N.
[02:27:49.895 --> 02:27:54.278]  And part of your satellite tracker tax in your car will be going to them.
[02:27:54.358 --> 02:27:56.519]  And that's MSNBC.
[02:27:58.581 --> 02:28:03.204]  And, again, they admit the tracking chips going in all the products now with Homeland Security controlling it.
[02:28:03.244 --> 02:28:04.264]  That's Associated Press.
[02:28:04.284 --> 02:28:04.985]  We have that article.
[02:28:06.736 --> 02:28:06.996]  U.S.
[02:28:07.196 --> 02:28:12.279]  Army patents biological weapons delivery system, violates bioweapons convention.
[02:28:12.319 --> 02:28:15.661]  This is out of the Hamburg News.
[02:28:16.022 --> 02:28:17.302]  And just, you know, U.S.
[02:28:17.422 --> 02:28:24.086]  Army developing and patenting a new generation, a new grenade that it says to be used to wage biowarfare.
[02:28:24.146 --> 02:28:26.588]  This is a violation of the Biological Weapons Convention.
[02:28:27.048 --> 02:28:27.869]  Does it matter?
[02:28:27.889 --> 02:28:31.671]  The government admits they test biologicals on us all the time.
[02:28:31.771 --> 02:28:34.893]  It's going on all over the state of Oklahoma right now.
[02:28:36.107 --> 02:28:37.608]  Sure, they admit they kill U.S.
[02:28:37.648 --> 02:28:39.028]  troops in these tests on purpose.
[02:28:39.108 --> 02:28:40.109]  So do the government.
[02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:42.470]  Killing our troops is patriotic for them.
[02:28:43.830 --> 02:28:47.612]  In fact, not supporting them putting our troops in meat grinders isn't patriotic.
[02:28:48.372 --> 02:28:50.913]  Being a mindless idiot is what's patriotic, folks.
[02:28:51.953 --> 02:28:53.874]  Destroying the Bill of Rights is good.
[02:28:53.894 --> 02:28:58.516]  Here's a big article out of the Chronicle magazine.
[02:28:59.216 --> 02:29:03.298]  Neoconservatism or Trotsky meets Stalin and Hitler.
[02:29:05.876 --> 02:29:07.978]  We read Ron Paul's speech a couple weeks ago.
[02:29:08.418 --> 02:29:21.691]  He gave on the House floor where he said the Bush administration is run by admitted Trotskyites who want a social welfare state and total government power and gun control.
[02:29:23.492 --> 02:29:24.393]  That was Ron Paul.
[02:29:24.493 --> 02:29:24.913]  I don't know.
[02:29:24.994 --> 02:29:27.796]  Most conservative member of Congress, but you know how those guys are.
[02:29:28.196 --> 02:29:29.558]  They're the liberals now.
[02:29:30.774 --> 02:29:37.560]  The neoconservatives are often depicted as former Trotskyites who have morphed into a new, closely related life form.
[02:29:38.641 --> 02:29:50.872]  It is pointed out that many early neocons, including the public interest founder Irving Kristol and coordinator Nathan Glaziner, Sidney Hook, and Albert Woltzetter, belonged to the
[02:29:51.986 --> 02:29:52.727]  We're good to go.
[02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:27.269]  As early as 1963, Richard Hofstetler commented on the provision in the profession of many ex-communists from the paranoid left to the paranoid right, clinging all the while to the fundamentally Machiavellian psychology that underlies both.
[02:30:27.469 --> 02:30:28.330]  And it does.
[02:30:28.630 --> 02:30:30.631]  Command and control.
[02:30:30.751 --> 02:30:32.832]  Different window dressing to confuse you.
[02:30:34.252 --> 02:30:36.953]  You've got secret police and a ski mask in both systems, folks.
[02:30:37.033 --> 02:30:44.375]  You've got, as Tony Montana says, a Chivano on every corner to grab you and put you in a camp, tell you what to eat, what to wear, what to sleep.
[02:30:44.955 --> 02:30:45.975]  It's all part of freedom.
[02:30:46.575 --> 02:30:56.538]  Four decades later, the dominant strain of neoconservatism is declared to be a mixture of geopolitical militarism and inverted socialist internationalism.
[02:30:57.501 --> 02:31:06.105]  Blanket depictions of neoconservatives as redesigned Trotskyites need to be corrected in favor of a more nuanced analysis.
[02:31:06.205 --> 02:31:06.925]  I agree totally.
[02:31:08.226 --> 02:31:20.991]  In several important respects, the neoconservative world outlook has derived from the Trotsky one, has acquired some striking similarities with Stalinism and German National Socialism or Nazis.
[02:31:21.562 --> 02:31:29.045]  Today's neoconservatives share with Stalin and Hitler an ideology of nationalist socialism and internationalist imperialism.
[02:31:29.306 --> 02:31:30.446]  You like that doublespeak?
[02:31:31.066 --> 02:31:36.449]  Nationalist socialism and internationalist imperialism.
[02:31:36.709 --> 02:31:38.049]  Total scrambling of terms.
[02:31:38.310 --> 02:31:42.111]  It's an evil empire of criminals confusing you with terms, okay?
[02:31:42.571 --> 02:31:43.452]  The similarities...
[02:31:44.275 --> 02:31:49.198]  Deserve closer scrutiny and may contribute to a better understanding of the most influential group in the U.S.
[02:31:49.238 --> 02:31:51.560]  foreign policy-making community.
[02:31:52.600 --> 02:32:03.347]  Certain important differences remain, notably the neoconservatives' hostility not only to Nazi race theory, oh, that's pure bull, but even to the most benign understanding of national or ethnic...
[02:32:04.651 --> 02:32:05.231]  Coherence.
[02:32:05.611 --> 02:32:08.532]  On the surface, there are also glaring differences in economics.
[02:32:08.552 --> 02:32:14.333]  However, the New Conservatives' glorification of the free market is more rhetoric, designed to placate the businessmen who fund them.
[02:32:14.353 --> 02:32:14.813]  That's true.
[02:32:15.353 --> 02:32:16.114]  Then reality.
[02:32:16.314 --> 02:32:16.994]  Oh, of course.
[02:32:18.194 --> 02:32:31.057]  In fact, the New Conservatives favor not free enterprise, but a kind of state capitalism, fascism, within the context of a geopolitical apparatus of the World Bank IMF that Hitler would have appreciated.
[02:32:31.676 --> 02:32:32.396]  Well, yeah.
[02:32:32.876 --> 02:32:44.421]  If they weren't communists, they were Prescott Bush, the grandfather, running over half of Nazi steel production and sharing the biggest Nazi bank.
[02:32:44.901 --> 02:32:45.421]  It goes on.
[02:32:45.461 --> 02:32:46.402]  It gets worse and worse.
[02:32:47.662 --> 02:32:55.525]  The neoconservative view of America as a hybrid imagination had an ardent supporter eight decades ago in Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler argued.
[02:32:56.135 --> 02:33:00.558]  Well, they follow the economist Strauss, who was an avowed fascist.
[02:33:00.638 --> 02:33:01.879]  I mean, this is their own writings.
[02:33:02.359 --> 02:33:10.545]  In Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler argued for a new, tightly centralized Germany by invoking the example of the United States and the triumph of the Union over states' rights.
[02:33:10.965 --> 02:33:21.472]  He concluded that National Socialism, as a matter of principle, may lay claim to the right of force to its principles on the whole German nation without consideration of previous federated state boundaries.
[02:33:22.032 --> 02:33:26.674]  Hitler was going to make a new Germany the way he imagined it or else destroy it.
[02:33:26.954 --> 02:33:35.999]  In the same vein, the Weekly Standard writes, Patriots only insofar as the American they imagine is a pliable tool of their global design.
[02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:39.540]  That's their quotes.
[02:33:39.841 --> 02:33:41.421]  They say they want to lie to you.
[02:33:41.461 --> 02:33:42.802]  They're for a welfare state.
[02:33:43.022 --> 02:33:44.403]  They love abortion.
[02:33:44.423 --> 02:33:46.944]  They love taking your guns.
[02:33:47.978 --> 02:33:53.560]  And you sit there and listen to the big national hosts who are all funded by them.
[02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:57.441]  They publish their dirty books, their lies.
[02:33:58.321 --> 02:34:01.402]  These are the most wicked of all liberals imaginable.
[02:34:02.202 --> 02:34:04.783]  Again, to use your term, they're really just command and controllers.
[02:34:04.943 --> 02:34:06.443]  All those terms mean nothing.
[02:34:08.624 --> 02:34:09.684]  Folks, we're in so much trouble.
[02:34:09.724 --> 02:34:12.405]  Let's take some calls, and I'm going to jump right back into this news.
[02:34:12.705 --> 02:34:14.285]  I am in a rant phase here.
[02:34:15.306 --> 02:34:16.586]  Jim in New York, go ahead.
[02:34:17.461 --> 02:34:18.021]  Hi, Alex.
[02:34:18.341 --> 02:34:19.521]  I really appreciate you.
[02:34:21.462 --> 02:34:22.382]  I'm just calling today.
[02:34:22.402 --> 02:34:35.844]  I've been a long-time listener, and I'm calling because I'm listening to you on Doc Wolf Station up in Rochester, New York, and they just had a big announcement with Kodak Park is getting rid of a bunch of jobs, and they're sending them to China and Mexico.
[02:34:35.864 --> 02:34:37.784]  And they're never coming back.
[02:34:38.565 --> 02:34:39.585]  No, they're never coming back.
[02:34:39.605 --> 02:34:41.665]  They told us NAFTA and GATT were great, though, didn't they?
[02:34:42.525 --> 02:34:46.706]  Well, it's hard to compete with those fellows that are over there being forced labor.
[02:34:47.822 --> 02:34:50.845]  And China has a 40% tariff on us.
[02:34:50.885 --> 02:34:52.407]  We have a 2% on them.
[02:34:52.487 --> 02:34:53.828]  It's not free or fair trade.
[02:34:54.109 --> 02:34:55.210]  It's giant scams.
[02:34:55.490 --> 02:34:57.312]  Free trade is how they got the euro.
[02:34:57.592 --> 02:34:59.174]  Free trade is globalism.
[02:34:59.574 --> 02:35:03.719]  Again, they're masters at mislabeling things and then hiding it in plain view.
[02:35:04.761 --> 02:35:12.323]  Well, the thing that I wanted to point out was I passed out a lot of the tapes, and I've got your bumper stickers on the back of the vehicles, and people think I'm crazy.
[02:35:12.644 --> 02:35:13.204]  But you know what?
[02:35:13.244 --> 02:35:14.364]  It's hitting them at home now.
[02:35:14.764 --> 02:35:15.905]  And maybe this will wake them up.
[02:35:15.945 --> 02:35:16.665]  Maybe it won't.
[02:35:16.965 --> 02:35:20.646]  But, you know, when I was growing up here in upstate New York, my neighbor had a farm.
[02:35:21.306 --> 02:35:26.688]  And I watched a cat corner a rat when I was a kid, and it intrigued me because he played with them until it got cornered.
[02:35:27.208 --> 02:35:29.929]  And then the thing stood up on its hind legs and still got killed.
[02:35:30.529 --> 02:35:31.230]  But I'm 36 years old now, and
[02:35:33.368 --> 02:35:39.492]  And what I think now is, if 10 of that little rat's buddies jumped on top of that cat, they could have tore him to shreds.
[02:35:40.473 --> 02:35:42.314]  And the New World Order is listening to you.
[02:35:42.354 --> 02:35:45.977]  All I want to say is, here, kitty, kitty, kitty, because I'm done.
[02:35:46.277 --> 02:35:47.338]  I've had it with these guys.
[02:35:48.018 --> 02:35:51.381]  And Fujifilm, by the way, tell your listeners, is made in America.
[02:35:53.522 --> 02:35:54.003]  All right.
[02:35:54.043 --> 02:35:57.005]  Well, I like Fuji color a little bit more.
[02:35:57.025 --> 02:36:00.147]  It accents a little more of the blues and greens, doesn't it?
[02:36:00.819 --> 02:36:02.700]  Well, I'm not sure about that, but I know this.
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:06.122]  I called Fuji this morning after I heard about this.
[02:36:06.442 --> 02:36:08.924]  Now listen, Kodak took good care of my family.
[02:36:08.964 --> 02:36:10.204]  My dad retired out of there.
[02:36:10.585 --> 02:36:20.330]  But George Eastman would be rolling in his grave right now if he knew what was going on to his company.
[02:36:21.031 --> 02:36:21.751]  Absolutely.
[02:36:22.692 --> 02:36:25.213]  And folks, thanks for the call.
[02:36:25.253 --> 02:36:26.114]  Great points, Jim.
[02:36:26.794 --> 02:36:28.615]  Let me just say this now about the economy.
[02:36:30.839 --> 02:36:31.759]  I'm standing in line.
[02:36:31.799 --> 02:36:32.999]  I told the story yesterday.
[02:36:33.019 --> 02:36:48.463]  I'm standing in line last weekend buying some, again, some wire mesh so my wife's chihuahuas don't climb out under the back porch and go barking at the neighbors, which they love to do.
[02:36:48.483 --> 02:36:51.504]  Imagine a chihuahua chasing cars.
[02:36:51.564 --> 02:36:53.304]  I mean, these dogs are just out of control.
[02:36:55.122 --> 02:36:56.883]  Anyways, I can't tell a story simply.
[02:36:56.903 --> 02:37:02.005]  The point is, I'm there, and they're pulling out all the checkout lines, putting in self-serve.
[02:37:02.345 --> 02:37:06.187]  The admitted plan is to get you trained on those and pull out all the service lines.
[02:37:08.868 --> 02:37:11.949]  And I pointed this out to people, and they said, good, it'll cut prices.
[02:37:12.089 --> 02:37:21.953]  Folks, if you look at the economic theory and the facts, if they get rid of all the service jobs, the entry-level jobs, the stuff the illegal aliens were going to do in many cases...
[02:37:23.340 --> 02:37:24.781]  Then what happens to the economy?
[02:37:24.861 --> 02:37:27.943]  How do people have money to drive the economy to buy the goods in there?
[02:37:29.844 --> 02:37:40.010]  Well, you see, you're going to go into quasi-governmental private funding where your money's put on a national ID card where the government supplements you in federal work projects.
[02:37:40.451 --> 02:37:44.573]  They intend to take your jobs so they can fully socialize things.
[02:37:44.973 --> 02:37:47.215]  You go, wait a minute, I thought it was fascist.
[02:37:47.876 --> 02:37:54.721]  They socialize you into government control, and then private interests control the government, and they privatize ownership and control.
[02:37:55.141 --> 02:37:56.242]  It's like the military.
[02:37:56.262 --> 02:37:58.624]  $200 billion now a year.
[02:37:59.724 --> 02:38:05.889]  In between that and $100 billion, depending on the year, in mercenary forces, and they plan to double that next year.
[02:38:05.909 --> 02:38:13.014]  I mean, the total funding each year for the military is only $450 billion.
[02:38:14.214 --> 02:38:16.316]  So already about a quarter of it is Merck.
[02:38:17.202 --> 02:38:17.843]  Mercenary?
[02:38:17.863 --> 02:38:21.666]  And it's said in the news they wear black uniforms and no one knows who they are.
[02:38:22.567 --> 02:38:25.149]  And yeah, there's some foreign troops, but they're here to help?
[02:38:25.269 --> 02:38:27.030]  I mean, mayday, folks!
[02:38:28.371 --> 02:38:38.020]  So I'm trying to tell this middle-class family, because everybody's lined up at the service checkouts, and hardly anybody's lined up at the self-serve.
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:40.982]  And again, it starts with a couple, and they tear out more and more.
[02:38:41.603 --> 02:38:44.485]  This is admitted, training you to accept it.
[02:38:45.126 --> 02:38:47.527]  They're doing it at HEB and everywhere else now.
[02:38:48.108 --> 02:38:49.248]  And I'm trying to warn them.
[02:38:49.848 --> 02:38:51.970]  I try to warn the clerk and she laughs at me.
[02:38:52.730 --> 02:38:54.291]  It's like these people at toll booths.
[02:38:54.331 --> 02:38:55.171]  They're getting rid of them.
[02:38:55.271 --> 02:38:57.132]  I've had them laugh at me.
[02:38:57.392 --> 02:39:01.334]  Then I drive to the same toll road five years later and there's no people.
[02:39:01.394 --> 02:39:02.175]  It's all automated.
[02:39:04.596 --> 02:39:04.836]  See?
[02:39:05.637 --> 02:39:06.897]  I mean, they even laugh at you.
[02:39:06.917 --> 02:39:08.218]  They're so stupid.
[02:39:08.398 --> 02:39:09.859]  They're such idiots.
[02:39:10.999 --> 02:39:12.180]  And it's about control.
[02:39:12.981 --> 02:39:17.182]  So you say, oh, well, corporations got to cut costs, you know, the yuppies five years ago.
[02:39:17.842 --> 02:39:21.763]  Oh, let the blue-collar folks lose their jobs to the illegal aliens, you know, or nothing.
[02:39:21.803 --> 02:39:22.843]  Yeah, I've got my job.
[02:39:22.883 --> 02:39:26.784]  Well, you're all losing your jobs now, and your kids aren't going to have any jobs.
[02:39:26.964 --> 02:39:33.345]  Your daughter's going to end up being a topless dancer at a whorehouse, and your son's going to end up cutting grass at the golf course.
[02:39:34.785 --> 02:39:39.746]  I don't care how many degrees they get, unless they work for DARPA or in some concentration camp.
[02:39:41.095 --> 02:39:41.915]  Let's take calls.
[02:39:41.955 --> 02:39:42.816]  It's disgusting.
[02:39:44.037 --> 02:39:46.218]  Let's talk to Manuel in Pennsylvania.
[02:39:46.238 --> 02:39:46.638]  Go ahead.
[02:39:47.318 --> 02:39:51.080]  Yes, you're killing me with this terrorist diatribe.
[02:39:51.140 --> 02:39:52.421]  I don't believe a word you guys say.
[02:39:53.581 --> 02:39:54.242]  Not one word.
[02:39:55.082 --> 02:39:56.243]  Okay, well, the government's good.
[02:39:56.283 --> 02:39:57.903]  We should submit to it then.
[02:39:58.284 --> 02:39:58.764]  You're right.
[02:39:58.824 --> 02:40:01.465]  I just got out of a government camp, a.k.a.
[02:40:01.525 --> 02:40:06.508]  Come Over, We'll Hang You High School, and that little manifesto you talk about, you call it the Bill of Rights.
[02:40:07.468 --> 02:40:09.089]  My loving government didn't mention that to me.
[02:40:11.113 --> 02:40:13.774]  Okay, well, yeah, they say it's part of Al-Qaeda now.
[02:40:13.854 --> 02:40:15.074]  FEMA actually teaches that.
[02:40:15.094 --> 02:40:17.795]  The Bill of Rights is a terrorist document, so I guess I'm a terrorist.
[02:40:18.195 --> 02:40:18.595]  They're right.
[02:40:18.655 --> 02:40:19.436]  You guys are crazy.
[02:40:19.656 --> 02:40:20.456]  I don't believe anything.
[02:40:20.776 --> 02:40:22.917]  The TV told me, you must be a gangster.
[02:40:22.937 --> 02:40:26.318]  The TV told me only cops have guns, and the bad guys, the gangsters.
[02:40:28.039 --> 02:40:28.919]  Well, yeah, that's it.
[02:40:28.979 --> 02:40:33.340]  In fact, the left admits the government's corrupt now, but we should still turn our guns in.
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:34.461]  That'll make us much safer.
[02:40:34.481 --> 02:40:35.681]  Well, you must be a gangster.
[02:40:36.281 --> 02:40:38.702]  The TV says only criminals and cops can have guns.
[02:40:39.827 --> 02:40:41.589]  Well, I guess they're all criminals, so yeah.
[02:40:42.571 --> 02:40:42.771]  Right.
[02:40:43.031 --> 02:40:50.361]  The government's criminals and then the other criminals that the government releases to terrify us into going to the organized criminals for protection.
[02:40:50.862 --> 02:40:52.805]  No, that's just more terrorist talk right there.
[02:40:54.227 --> 02:40:54.527]  It is.
[02:40:54.607 --> 02:40:55.648]  It's all terrorist talk.
[02:40:57.108 --> 02:40:59.689]  Hey, you know, it's like this BBC article where they admit the U.S.
[02:40:59.709 --> 02:41:01.370]  government killed U.S.
[02:41:01.410 --> 02:41:02.251]  troops on purpose.
[02:41:02.291 --> 02:41:04.732]  Just killed them with bioweapons and chemicals.
[02:41:04.772 --> 02:41:06.093]  I mean, that's a loving thing, isn't it?
[02:41:06.593 --> 02:41:07.754]  Must have been for their security.
[02:41:07.974 --> 02:41:08.934]  Something about security.
[02:41:08.954 --> 02:41:09.315]  I don't know.
[02:41:09.675 --> 02:41:10.515]  Must have been something.
[02:41:11.276 --> 02:41:12.556]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:41:13.016 --> 02:41:16.598]  I'd like to say, have you heard anything about some owl club?
[02:41:16.778 --> 02:41:17.419]  Anything like that?
[02:41:18.339 --> 02:41:18.740]  Down here?
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:19.880]  I'll hold over.
[02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:21.341]  Oh, the Bohemian Grove?
[02:41:22.341 --> 02:41:28.564]  Well, down here, downtown in the city over here where I am, there's an Owl Club, and it has a black horned owl outside on some kind of sign.
[02:41:29.084 --> 02:41:31.485]  I have heard about that in Pennsylvania.
[02:41:31.505 --> 02:41:33.166]  There's a lot of Bohemian Grove clubs.
[02:41:33.206 --> 02:41:33.566]  Stay there.
[02:41:36.718 --> 02:41:43.524]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:41:43.865 --> 02:41:45.226]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:41:45.426 --> 02:41:47.628]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:41:47.648 --> 02:41:49.890]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:55.095]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:41:55.435 --> 02:41:59.459]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:41:59.699 --> 02:42:00.160]  We're good to go.
[02:42:18.183 --> 02:42:18.363]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:18.403 --> 02:42:19.985]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[02:42:20.005 --> 02:42:20.525]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:42:35.914 --> 02:42:37.895]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:42:37.975 --> 02:42:38.635]  Hello, folks.
[02:42:38.755 --> 02:42:48.699]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:42:49.079 --> 02:42:53.601]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:42:53.661 --> 02:43:04.985]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste, and odors are separated from the water.
[02:43:05.285 --> 02:43:06.046]  We're good to go.
[02:43:35.305 --> 02:43:36.026]  We think so.
[02:43:56.568 --> 02:44:00.792]  For a free special market report on the Euro currency, call Barclay Financial right now.
[02:44:00.952 --> 02:44:01.593]  Call 800-348-4100.
[02:44:02.714 --> 02:44:03.795]  That's 800-348-4100.
[02:44:03.815 --> 02:44:06.877]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[02:44:06.897 --> 02:44:14.064]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year, and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[02:44:14.224 --> 02:44:14.684]  We're good to go.
[02:44:14.704 --> 02:44:15.164]  We're good to go.
[02:44:38.653 --> 02:44:44.679]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:44:45.299 --> 02:44:48.302]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:49.443 --> 02:44:54.427]  The people have been in tyranny so long they can't even recognize it when it's looking them in the eyes.
[02:44:54.607 --> 02:44:59.732]  Real quick, Manuel from Pennsylvania, because I want to go to Chris, Tim, and Perry real quick.
[02:45:00.843 --> 02:45:06.326]  Yeah, the number one fraternity here in Austin at UT flies the Skull and Bones outside.
[02:45:06.346 --> 02:45:12.449]  So you've got lots of wannabes that want to copy the Grove and copy Skull and Bones.
[02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:17.812]  So you do have little satellites of some of the more sinister globalist groups out there.
[02:45:17.852 --> 02:45:18.713]  Real quick, finish up.
[02:45:19.073 --> 02:45:20.213]  Right, we all have TV to watch.
[02:45:20.253 --> 02:45:21.094]  Let's make this quick.
[02:45:21.134 --> 02:45:21.594]  I'm upset.
[02:45:22.034 --> 02:45:23.375]  You keep calling this a republic.
[02:45:23.975 --> 02:45:26.757]  I was watching the TV program, I mean the TV circus show.
[02:45:27.287 --> 02:45:28.428]  They said this is a democracy.
[02:45:28.468 --> 02:45:29.788]  We make the laws as we go along.
[02:45:29.828 --> 02:45:31.409]  There's no such thing as a republic.
[02:45:31.889 --> 02:45:37.252]  Yeah, in a republic, the minority has rights as well as the majority, but not in the precious democracy.
[02:45:37.272 --> 02:45:41.554]  In the democracy, if they say, you know, kill all the Christians, it happens.
[02:45:41.594 --> 02:45:42.394]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:43.354 --> 02:45:45.936]  Yeah, they just keep repeating it, Republicans and Democrats.
[02:45:45.996 --> 02:45:47.216]  Chris in Kentucky, go ahead.
[02:45:47.856 --> 02:45:48.397]  Hello, Alex.
[02:45:48.697 --> 02:45:49.197]  How you doing?
[02:45:49.397 --> 02:45:50.218]  I'm doing great.
[02:45:51.627 --> 02:45:56.613]  Last night on Butch Paul's show, did you hear, I guess it was Rick Stanley that was on his show last night?
[02:45:56.833 --> 02:45:57.293]  No, I didn't.
[02:45:57.694 --> 02:46:02.459]  He was on there really raving mad because he couldn't carry a pistol in the open.
[02:46:02.699 --> 02:46:05.182]  He's been harassed by the police constantly in Denver.
[02:46:06.283 --> 02:46:07.445]  And this is the system.
[02:46:09.066 --> 02:46:13.011]  He's put up a website, and there are people across the country
[02:46:13.419 --> 02:46:16.360]  Or defending this man, the right to carry that firearm in public.
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:18.301]  It's not a privilege.
[02:46:18.341 --> 02:46:18.881]  It's a right.
[02:46:19.181 --> 02:46:21.562]  That last caller, you know, you're way off track.
[02:46:21.582 --> 02:46:24.442]  You might as well just go back to socialism and learn that.
[02:46:24.863 --> 02:46:25.943]  Read the Constitution.
[02:46:26.363 --> 02:46:27.964]  The caller was being sarcastic.
[02:46:28.264 --> 02:46:28.684]  Oh, was he?
[02:46:29.304 --> 02:46:29.724]  Yeah.
[02:46:30.004 --> 02:46:31.024]  So am I. Anyway.
[02:46:33.475 --> 02:46:37.796]  Yeah, and he has a website out called Stanley, S-T-N-E-L-E-Y.
[02:46:37.816 --> 02:46:40.657]  He said it was going to be up today, 2000.org.
[02:46:40.877 --> 02:46:42.098]  Well, it's been up for a while.
[02:46:42.378 --> 02:46:43.018]  Yeah, it was down.
[02:46:43.078 --> 02:46:43.858]  He said it was back up.
[02:46:43.918 --> 02:46:45.118]  It's supposed to be back up today.
[02:46:45.178 --> 02:46:46.619]  Yeah, I'll keep meaning to get him on.
[02:46:46.639 --> 02:46:47.759]  Hey, I've got to jump, Chris.
[02:46:47.799 --> 02:46:48.259]  Thanks, bud.
[02:46:48.659 --> 02:46:49.380]  Really appreciate it.
[02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:51.900]  Perry, Perry, where are you calling us from today?
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:54.461]  Hello, Alex.
[02:46:57.902 --> 02:47:01.363]  Friends of mine tell me that this Tom Ridge...
[02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:04.630]  The Knights of Columbus?
[02:47:06.010 --> 02:47:06.951]  Are you there?
[02:47:06.991 --> 02:47:07.751]  Yeah, I'm right here.
[02:47:08.071 --> 02:47:20.176]  Yeah, well, anyway, all these fellas around here, we sit around and have coffee, and they're Jesuits and Knights of Columbus, and they're all... How do these guys figure into all this stuff?
[02:47:20.823 --> 02:47:22.565]  Low-level Masons aren't bad.
[02:47:22.625 --> 02:47:24.726]  Low-level Knights of Columbus aren't bad.
[02:47:25.607 --> 02:47:33.333]  It's the tops of the organizations that are corrupt, and then you've got the little guys giving their dues to it who are compartmentalized.
[02:47:33.393 --> 02:47:38.517]  I mean, it's the same way with police, same thing with the CIA, same thing with the FBI.
[02:47:38.737 --> 02:47:49.846]  The FBI tried to stop all the hijackers, and the FBI bosses told them, you'll be arrested if you do, and then the FBI bosses that blocked them got cash bonuses, record cash bonuses.
[02:47:50.882 --> 02:47:51.223]  Okay.
[02:47:51.504 --> 02:47:56.053]  So you've got this satanic core and then out from this core you've got all these different
[02:47:58.347 --> 02:48:06.410]  Organizations that are just... That are full of useful idiots thinking they're doing a good thing when they're really empowering the New World Order.
[02:48:06.590 --> 02:48:07.251]  I'm out of time.
[02:48:07.271 --> 02:48:07.991]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:08.511 --> 02:48:11.412]  I'm really sorry that I'm out of time and can't take any other calls.
[02:48:11.512 --> 02:48:12.893]  And I didn't get to a bunch of the news.
[02:48:12.953 --> 02:48:14.674]  I did cover quite a bit of it.

[02:48:29.637 --> 02:48:34.799]  It's that everybody knows all the minutia and all the details and gets so upset about sports.
[02:48:35.299 --> 02:48:39.280]  They don't care about the destruction of America and the world by the globalists.
