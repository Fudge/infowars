[00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.606]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.183 --> 00:00:15.823]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:17.544]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:19.365]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:20.846]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:22.507]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.147 --> 00:00:26.809]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.472]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.117 --> 00:00:43.479]  There can no longer be any doubt
[00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:52.522]  The government of this country wants a dumbed down, mindless population of idiots.
[00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:56.143]  We have the Department of Education documents.
[00:00:56.824 --> 00:01:08.129]  We have Senate hearings over a hundred years ago where they talked about education of the public causing a crisis for the government and how they needed to dumb the people down.
[00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.511]  We posted some of those documents on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com today.
[00:01:15.043 --> 00:01:19.824]  We know that they want to control our society and turn us into non-thinkers.
[00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:29.727]  And there was a great example of this yesterday in the New York Post, and it's posted on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:32.907]  Caller called in about it, and we do have the article.
[00:01:33.587 --> 00:01:35.628]  And in 20 minutes, the father's coming on.
[00:01:35.648 --> 00:01:37.128]  His daughter has a 3.8.
[00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.949]  She's 15.
[00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.469]  She's graduating from college.
[00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.530]  And the judge says she can't have her degree.
[00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:54.770]  And the CPS is coming after him with a criminal investigation discussing taking the child, the young lady, the young adult, away from her family.
[00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:03.734]  They say it's abusive not to send your child to public schools so your child can learn how to be a crack dealer, a New World Order minion.
[00:02:04.695 --> 00:02:13.759]  Now we have the UNESCO documents, we have the Department of Education documents, we have the Senate documents, over a hundred years old, with a plan to dumb us down into public schools.
[00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:26.178]  And then they go after people whose children have 3.8 grade averages in top colleges at 15 years of age, and the government's coming with criminal charges against them.
[00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:29.181]  Pretty obvious what they're all about, isn't it?
[00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.363]  Yes, it's we have their own admissions.
[00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:40.090]  And that's what stuns this broadcast, this host, is that we have the globalists in their crime, in triplicate, and
[00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:46.689]  The neocons are running offense and defense for the liberals, the socialists, the control freaks.
[00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.110]  And shame on you big government people.
[00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.110]  Shame on you government bureaucrats.
[00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.832]  I mean, how do you go after a 15-year-old with a 3.8 grade average?
[00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:59.733]  That's in the top 97 percentile.
[00:03:00.193 --> 00:03:06.434]  How do you go after a 15-year-old who's about to graduate from college, and how does the judge say she can't have her college diploma?
[00:03:07.455 --> 00:03:09.015]  From a top accredited college.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.761]  So, that's coming up in about 15 minutes.
[00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:13.401]  They'll be joining us.
[00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:23.405]  Then we have Dr. David Bannon coming on the show, who worked for Interpol, going around, I guess, assassinating people, basically.
[00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:25.406]  That's coming up in the second hour.
[00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:30.368]  And we've got World War III brewing with North Korea, Iran, Syria.
[00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:32.288]  More U.S.
[00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:35.790]  troops getting killed, gunfire exchanged over the DMZ.
[00:03:37.412 --> 00:03:37.772]  We're good.
[00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:52.427]  Nukes will go off in U.S.
[00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:52.788]  cities.
[00:03:52.868 --> 00:03:53.869]  It's going to happen.
[00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.330]  He, of course, he's CFR.
[00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.191]  And, hey, they'll love it.
[00:03:57.211 --> 00:04:02.355]  A nuke goes off in a city, they'll have even more of an excuse to tell you the government's your boss.
[00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.396]  They're going to take all your rights for your safety.
[00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:07.499]  And, of course, it won't be North Korea detonating that nuke, folks.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:18.323]  It'll be the shadow government and out of that all of their training, all of their takeover systems will be activated and things are going to go downhill very, very quickly.
[00:04:18.663 --> 00:04:26.625]  Or we could speak out and get involved and blow the whistle inside and outside of government and stand up against the military-industrial complex and save America!
[00:04:27.906 --> 00:04:31.507]  But the yuppies and the bureaucrats and all of you are in for a rude awakening.
[00:04:31.547 --> 00:04:35.888]  You can't go on being part of an evil system forever and not have it turn on you.
[00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:37.889]  And you're all about to find out.
[00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:45.463]  You've all been finding out individually over time, but you're going to find out on a mass scale what your masters think of you will do to you.
[00:04:47.024 --> 00:04:50.286]  So we're entering the ninth circle of hell, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:51.607]  Just all the evidence is there.
[00:04:52.268 --> 00:04:53.629]  We'll break it down today.
[00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:55.850]  Where evil is good and good is evil.
[00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.892]  Where black is white, where black is white, where white is black.
[00:04:59.213 --> 00:05:00.754]  Where up is down, where down is up.
[00:05:01.274 --> 00:05:02.895]  Where left is right, where right is left.
[00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:05.477]  Where decency is evil and evil is good.
[00:05:05.497 --> 00:05:07.498]  Oh, I guess I'm evil then.
[00:05:07.518 --> 00:05:08.199]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:12.393]  Are you willing to speculate in today's market?
[00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:16.376]  Options investing involves substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.
[00:05:16.736 --> 00:05:18.918]  I'm Patrick T. Parker for Barclay Financial.
[00:05:19.078 --> 00:05:23.021]  Right now, we're recommending the purchase of euro currency call options.
[00:05:23.361 --> 00:05:25.503]  The budget and trade deficits are going through the roof.
[00:05:25.603 --> 00:05:27.564]  The dollar is dropping worldwide.
[00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:29.466]  Could the euro be poised to move higher?
[00:05:29.726 --> 00:05:30.467]  We think so.
[00:05:30.707 --> 00:05:34.930]  For a free special market report on the euro currency, call Barclay Financial right now.
[00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.330]  Call 800-348-4100.

[00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:19.257]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:19.397 --> 00:06:23.799]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.140]  The New World Order.
[00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.717]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:40.794 --> 00:06:51.119]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:56.682]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:11.585 --> 00:07:15.207]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:19.749]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:24.431]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:27.573]  There are no moving parts, and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[00:07:27.853 --> 00:07:32.475]  It works for just pennies a day, with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[00:07:32.755 --> 00:07:36.577]  Made of the finest materials, it has a 2-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[00:07:36.897 --> 00:07:39.278]  And the Aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[00:07:39.558 --> 00:07:43.479]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:48.880]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.020]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.081]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:58.882]  For more information about the Aeronizer, call Toll Free and tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[00:07:59.102 --> 00:08:00.564]  The toll free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:00.784]  That's 877-605-9200.
[00:08:14.697 --> 00:08:15.337]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.998 --> 00:08:17.059]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:18.900]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:20.342]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.103 --> 00:08:23.024]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:26.347]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.868 --> 00:08:30.912]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:48.877 --> 00:08:59.100]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, coming up in about 12 minutes, we're going to be joined by Angela Lipsman's father, headline,
[00:09:00.077 --> 00:09:00.957]  Port K.O.'
[00:09:00.917 --> 00:09:19.045]  's college whiz kid, a 15-year-old Manhattan girl whose parents sent her to college instead of high school, has been told by a judge that she can't get her associate's degree even though she's got enough credits as city officials launch an educational neglect probe against her dad.
[00:09:20.885 --> 00:09:22.586]  She got into college at 11.
[00:09:22.706 --> 00:09:27.208]  She has a 3.8 and was about to get her bachelor's degree.
[00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.757]  And to move on with her Master's that she was already working on, trying to complete that by 16.
[00:09:34.237 --> 00:09:43.248]  And they have started, it says here in the New York Post, criminal investigations and are going to charge them.
[00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.873]  So that's the new America.
[00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:55.779]  That's the new America, and they do not want you to be intelligent, to be informed, to be able to think for yourself.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:12.612]  I have the official Senate documents, official Department of Education, official UN, where they say word for word, dumbing you down, creating an individual that cannot think, destroying the family, is the name of the game.
[00:10:14.793 --> 00:10:16.414]  Is there any doubt of their criminality?
[00:10:16.474 --> 00:10:16.995]  So now,
[00:10:17.859 --> 00:10:22.522]  Your daughter is in college at 15, graduating from college.
[00:10:23.103 --> 00:10:24.644]  Criminal charges coming down.
[00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:28.947]  And the judge says you don't get to have your degree.
[00:10:29.027 --> 00:10:30.728]  Your work is all disallowed.
[00:10:32.189 --> 00:10:33.810]  So that's the new America, folks.
[00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.752]  You excel, you are punished.
[00:10:36.012 --> 00:10:37.793]  You're a mindless idiot, you're rewarded.
[00:10:39.574 --> 00:10:44.658]  We've talked about how Child Kidnapping Services is targeting homeschoolers nationwide.
[00:10:46.144 --> 00:10:48.807]  Nationwide viciously attacking them.
[00:10:49.188 --> 00:10:55.696]  There's moves to bar them from spelling bees and from geography bees because they keep winning everything.
[00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.333]  I haven't seen a report where it wasn't a homeschooler or someone from private school.
[00:11:01.554 --> 00:11:03.655]  So they're attacking that viciously.
[00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:15.825]  They can't stand it that it's being exposed and that now three million children have exited the public schools to homeschool and tens of millions are also going to private schools.
[00:11:15.885 --> 00:11:25.573]  They are convulsing in anger and attempting with vouchers, a crafty neocon scam, to federalize the private schools.
[00:11:25.613 --> 00:11:26.734]  You don't want vouchers
[00:11:27.836 --> 00:11:35.143]  You just want the capacity to simply not pay property taxes if you don't have your children in a government death camp.
[00:11:35.183 --> 00:11:36.364]  I mean, a government training camp.
[00:11:37.345 --> 00:11:38.586]  A government dumb-down camp.
[00:11:38.626 --> 00:11:43.330]  A government thumb scan, face scan, cavity search camp.
[00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.454]  A government camp where they have video cameras in the school showers.
[00:11:51.097 --> 00:11:53.339]  A government re-education dumb-down center.
[00:11:54.366 --> 00:11:55.927]  So that's a big deal that's coming up.
[00:11:56.327 --> 00:11:59.709]  The news is incredible but I do have a death threat email.
[00:11:59.909 --> 00:12:15.358]  I get these about every week and basically it says that I'm with Al Qaeda because I believe in freedom and that the guy says he's in Texas and that if I ever come to Texas I'm in deep trouble.
[00:12:16.259 --> 00:12:18.480]  Well, I'm right here in Texas, sir.
[00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:28.306]  And of course, I'm a big liberal, and I need to be stopped, and the war is holy, and basically, I'm with the devil.
[00:12:29.828 --> 00:12:36.594]  So, I guess Ron Paul is with his big story, Neocon, that we posted a few days ago.
[00:12:36.614 --> 00:12:38.015]  Neocond.
[00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:39.297]  Neocond.
[00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.391]  Where he talks about the biggest threat being the neocons.
[00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:49.651]  Maybe later I'll read this.
[00:12:50.011 --> 00:12:54.952]  There's so much profanity from this Christian conservative that I can't read but about half of it.
[00:12:55.393 --> 00:12:57.693]  The person is an incoherent babbling idiot.
[00:12:59.594 --> 00:13:03.715]  But what's coming up in the news today, mortar attacks on U.S.
[00:13:03.795 --> 00:13:04.995]  bases growing.
[00:13:06.095 --> 00:13:06.936]  Mortar attacks on U.S.
[00:13:06.976 --> 00:13:08.236]  bases in Iraq booming.
[00:13:09.184 --> 00:13:11.664]  And becoming a growing problem for troops.
[00:13:11.704 --> 00:13:12.385]  Yeah, problem.
[00:13:12.705 --> 00:13:17.045]  But Bush is back the hearst up and he's waving the coffins into the back.
[00:13:17.426 --> 00:13:18.186]  Bring them on.
[00:13:18.226 --> 00:13:19.586]  I saw an editorial cartoon.
[00:13:21.086 --> 00:13:28.228]  And a lot of conservatives, real conservatives, are mad about this because, you know, you don't say bring it on because that does encourage attacks.
[00:13:28.448 --> 00:13:35.529]  And by the way, you don't release three separate battle plans to attack North Korea detailing how you plan to attack them.
[00:13:36.235 --> 00:13:37.597]  That endangers the troops.
[00:13:37.897 --> 00:13:45.026]  I mean, even if you're going to go in there and it's the right thing to do, which it's not, you still don't release the battle plan.
[00:13:45.386 --> 00:13:48.751]  But again, this is trying to get North Korea to do something stupid, and they are.
[00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:50.252]  They're doing jet overflights.
[00:13:50.753 --> 00:13:52.575]  They've got patrol boats shooting at people.
[00:13:53.016 --> 00:13:54.558]  They're shooting almost every day now.
[00:13:55.996 --> 00:14:11.205]  The South Korean troops, a massive escalation, the five-foot demon, the demigod, the hereditary dictator, we have one here too, but the hereditary dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-il, is running around foaming at the mouth now, after Rumsfeld gave him the weapons.
[00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:20.651]  And they've got the nukes, by the way, and they're threatening Japan, and Japan's in an arms race now, building nukes, massive escalation, World War III, that's coming up.
[00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:26.533]  A pro-American mayor's son killed in Iraq yesterday.
[00:14:26.554 --> 00:14:26.594]  U.S.
[00:14:26.614 --> 00:14:27.858]  soldier.
[00:14:29.173 --> 00:14:33.515]  Iraqi child, pro-American mayor and son killed in Iraq, a Saddam loyalist attack.
[00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.677]  These aren't Saddam loyalists, but again, it's like Goldstein.
[00:14:37.217 --> 00:14:38.738]  There's the boogeyman from 1984.
[00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:42.460]  Anytime there's a problem, oh, it's Goldstein.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:54.447]  The Iraqi people love being arrested if they're caught selling things in the city bazaars without a special Halliburton license, who gets to run the country and own the people as the slaves, literally.
[00:14:55.134 --> 00:14:56.815]  You can't have a job without their certification.
[00:14:57.175 --> 00:14:59.257]  You're caught selling baggage, beer.
[00:14:59.897 --> 00:15:01.778]  You're caught selling guns.
[00:15:01.798 --> 00:15:03.499]  You're caught selling light bulbs.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.741]  There's no trading allowed.
[00:15:05.761 --> 00:15:07.022]  I mean, that's the Associated Press.
[00:15:07.422 --> 00:15:11.684]  They put a bag over your head, take you where they chain you up with your knees bent up under you.
[00:15:11.845 --> 00:15:12.925]  Horrible form of torture.
[00:15:13.386 --> 00:15:14.406]  Well, they say it's not.
[00:15:14.426 --> 00:15:18.068]  I guess when the Vietnamese did it to our troops, it was actually good, you know.
[00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:19.750]  I always thought it was bad, you know.
[00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.532]  I was against the communist North Vietnamese, but maybe now they were good, you know, because
[00:15:24.304 --> 00:15:25.385]  We do the same thing to people now.
[00:15:27.307 --> 00:15:34.714]  Cheney under pressure to quit over false war evidence and the fact that he's got all the private contracts with no bids allowed in Iraq.
[00:15:35.775 --> 00:15:41.480]  Anger grows on both sides of Atlantic at mishandling claims of the eve of Iraq conflict.
[00:15:42.721 --> 00:15:44.643]  And that will they scapegoat Cheney?
[00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:46.785]  Doesn't matter, they're all just puppets.
[00:15:47.881 --> 00:15:52.322]  Of course, Cheney's nowhere to be seen, generally at the Grove this time of year.
[00:15:52.502 --> 00:15:56.804]  We'll find out after the Grove ends its meeting in two weeks if he was there.
[00:15:57.824 --> 00:15:58.804]  But he's generally there.
[00:15:59.504 --> 00:16:02.525]  That's where they handle policy there, Northern California.
[00:16:03.245 --> 00:16:05.666]  That's where he was chosen as the VP running mate in 99.
[00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:08.227]  That was announced at CNN, by the way.
[00:16:09.361 --> 00:16:11.122]  Uh, there's a bunch of other articles here.
[00:16:11.242 --> 00:16:14.542]  Again, we have, uh, Dr. David Race Bannon.
[00:16:14.562 --> 00:16:18.243]  I guess our Johnny Quest music will fit in nice with that, Race Bannon.
[00:16:18.803 --> 00:16:23.024]  But, uh, Dr. David Race Bannon joining us.
[00:16:23.485 --> 00:16:27.566]  The secret mission of the Interpol agent who tracked the world's most sinister criminals.
[00:16:28.306 --> 00:16:29.706]  And, uh, that's coming up in the second hour.
[00:16:29.726 --> 00:16:34.467]  A listener sent me this email, and a famous quote wanted me to read it.
[00:16:34.767 --> 00:16:36.748]  And I agree, this James Madison quote is good.
[00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.492]  Knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[00:16:40.692 --> 00:16:48.339]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that it gives.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:17:00.090]  A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy of perhaps both James Madison, fourth president of the United States.
[00:17:01.678 --> 00:17:14.121]  And I've got official Department of Education, UN, and Senate documents going back from last year to 1899 where they say that educated masses are hard to govern.
[00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:19.403]  We must remove critical thinking and understanding of history from their grasp.
[00:17:19.423 --> 00:17:20.923]  Well, that's a quote from a Senate document.
[00:17:21.223 --> 00:17:25.264]  We've posted that on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:25.304 --> 00:17:26.464]  It's from the memory hole.
[00:17:26.484 --> 00:17:28.625]  Another Orwellian illusion.
[00:17:29.963 --> 00:17:32.624]  A few weeks ago, it was the Newsmax publication.
[00:17:32.644 --> 00:17:35.526]  I actually have the UNESCO document, but they put it on the web for us.
[00:17:35.546 --> 00:17:36.366]  I appreciate that.
[00:17:36.907 --> 00:17:39.368]  Where they say the families of disease must be eradicated.
[00:17:39.848 --> 00:17:41.989]  By the way, they write policy for the Department of Education.
[00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:49.213]  See, then you wonder why, with the guests we have coming up, you wonder why
[00:17:50.815 --> 00:18:01.959]  With this situation, if your child, your young adult is 15, about to graduate from college, they say, no, you can't have your degree, and we're going to go ahead and criminally charge you, and you may be taken from the home.
[00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:04.660]  We hear this all the time.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:17.604]  You've got kids that win the Spelling Bee, they're in the paper, they're 12, they're in a high school level senior Spelling Bee, they win, this was in the news a few weeks ago, and then CPS comes
[00:18:19.423 --> 00:18:21.624]  You never filled out your paperwork to not be in public school.
[00:18:22.825 --> 00:18:28.447]  The father says, no, you're not taking my child to be tested in some government office building.
[00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:29.848]  No, that's fine.
[00:18:29.868 --> 00:18:31.209]  We'll be back in two hours with a warrant.
[00:18:31.229 --> 00:18:32.229]  They come, take the kid.
[00:18:32.469 --> 00:18:33.790]  The mother's crying, begging.
[00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.932]  The bureaucrat laughs.
[00:18:38.152 --> 00:18:39.172]  No one's gonna stop us!
[00:18:39.352 --> 00:18:40.613]  The neocons defend us!
[00:18:41.542 --> 00:18:45.406]  The neocons would talk about this on their filthy, dirty, liberal talk shows.
[00:18:45.766 --> 00:18:47.207]  This would all end overnight.
[00:18:47.608 --> 00:18:48.148]  But it won't.
[00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:52.772]  It's all how stupid Hillary is, and how stupid and how evil Jesse Jackson is.
[00:18:53.032 --> 00:18:54.073]  We already know that.
[00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:54.754]  Okay?
[00:18:54.894 --> 00:18:57.056]  Let's talk about the real evil, as Ron Paul did.
[00:18:57.096 --> 00:19:00.539]  The neocons, who were ramming the whole agenda through.
[00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:04.243]  These people are scary, folks.
[00:19:04.283 --> 00:19:05.524]  They are so evil.
[00:19:05.564 --> 00:19:06.685]  They are so self-righteous.
[00:19:06.725 --> 00:19:07.806]  They are so out of control.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.342]  We're in so much trouble, folks.
[00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.483]  We're in so much trouble.
[00:19:15.384 --> 00:19:20.208]  I mean, your kid wins a Spelling Bee and so CPS comes after you?
[00:19:20.228 --> 00:19:26.214]  Your young adult's 15, graduating from college with honors, and so CPS comes with police?
[00:19:28.576 --> 00:19:31.839]  I mean, is that what... You see, but they put this out on purpose.
[00:19:33.146 --> 00:19:36.648]  They put this in the news on purpose to condition you to accept it.
[00:19:36.848 --> 00:19:43.352]  That's why they put it in the news that, yeah, we put cameras in the 10-year-old boys' and girls' showers in public schools now.
[00:19:44.152 --> 00:19:46.753]  Source Associated Press, yeah, it's for your safety.
[00:19:47.274 --> 00:19:54.117]  Yeah, the images are accessible over the net, but... You know, this is the new America, folks.
[00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:57.599]  And you're just gonna sit there and take it, aren't you?
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.640]  Well, you better not.
[00:20:00.913 --> 00:20:03.381]  By the way, Bush again says he'll sign the assault weapons ban.
[00:20:03.401 --> 00:20:04.545]  That's how conservative he is.
[00:20:05.267 --> 00:20:06.130]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.651]  Stay with us.
[00:20:11.528 --> 00:20:16.010]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.452]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:21.293]  We listened.
[00:20:21.593 --> 00:20:26.575]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:26.855 --> 00:20:27.335]  We listened.
[00:20:27.716 --> 00:20:30.757]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:31.197 --> 00:20:31.717]  We listened.
[00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:35.179]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[00:20:35.179 --> 00:20:35.339]  I think?
[00:21:02.081 --> 00:21:03.903]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:21:04.283 --> 00:21:07.987]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:22:09.426 --> 00:22:13.092]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:13.513 --> 00:22:18.941]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:19.402 --> 00:22:20.463]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:22:20.523 --> 00:22:24.510]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:25.191 --> 00:22:38.502]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:39.022 --> 00:22:44.326]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:44.626 --> 00:22:50.511]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:22:51.255 --> 00:22:53.056]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:54.117 --> 00:22:57.259]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:22:57.719 --> 00:22:58.320]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.521]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:23:00.541 --> 00:23:00.601]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:08.619 --> 00:23:17.785]  Enzyme Phytonutrient, or EPN, is a new all-in-one combination of enzymes and saccharides necessary for optimal cellular communication.
[00:23:18.425 --> 00:23:28.452]  EPN is created using a unique 14-day process resembling human digestion, in which soy seeds are completely assimilated into basic nutrients and natural sweeteners.
[00:23:29.072 --> 00:23:34.795]  Enzymes are complex proteins found in digestive juices causing food to break down at an accelerated rate.
[00:23:35.335 --> 00:23:40.638]  Phytonutrients come from plants which provide important protective substances called phytochemicals.
[00:23:41.158 --> 00:23:44.140]  Saccharides are known to be important in cellular communication.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.462]  One tablespoon before each meal is all that is needed.
[00:23:47.882 --> 00:24:00.770]  The diseases EPN may be helpful in relieving are too numerous to mention here, so call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for more information about this exciting new dietary supplement.
[00:24:01.331 --> 00:24:02.932]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[00:24:30.644 --> 00:24:31.964]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:32.004 --> 00:24:35.285]  Alex Jones here live, blasting out on the AM and FM dial.
[00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:41.628]  Simulcasting on the internet at Infowars.com and net, as well as PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:43.528 --> 00:24:46.309]  Global shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20, and at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:54.101]  I've read the official U.S.
[00:24:54.121 --> 00:24:58.306]  Government Senate documents where they say an educated population is hard to govern.
[00:24:58.746 --> 00:25:02.511]  We need to destroy the thinking process of the American people that's over 100 years old.
[00:25:03.973 --> 00:25:08.598]  UNESCO plans from the 50s saying that the family's the enemy.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.741]  Must be destroyed.
[00:25:10.841 --> 00:25:12.183]  Bush, of course, is signing on to that.
[00:25:13.058 --> 00:25:18.923]  We've had the former head of policy, Department of Education, number two position in the first Reagan administration, Carolyn Isserby on.
[00:25:19.504 --> 00:25:26.970]  She has the official documents, internal documents, classified documents, where they talk about how they want to train the kids to be mindless idiots.
[00:25:28.872 --> 00:25:35.057]  And you don't see any greater evidence of how they don't want any free minds out there than the New York Post.
[00:25:35.117 --> 00:25:37.880]  They reported on Angela Lipsman,
[00:25:39.407 --> 00:26:06.850]  Who got into college at 11, at a big accredited college, and has a 3.8 grade average, and they were very proud of her, and now the judge got involved and said, you can't have your degree, you didn't go to our accredited public school, you didn't go to your government training camp for proper dumbing down, and CPS, Child Grabbing Services, has been called in, and we've seen articles where, again, a 12-year-old wins a spelling bee with seniors,
[00:26:07.928 --> 00:26:10.449]  Uh, you know, and suddenly CPS is at their door.
[00:26:10.489 --> 00:26:14.251]  They just hate it that these kids are not being ruined by the system.
[00:26:14.331 --> 00:26:17.632]  And it's... I don't know if the CPS consciously knows this.
[00:26:18.012 --> 00:26:19.993]  They're like Hitler stormtroopers.
[00:26:20.013 --> 00:26:22.034]  They just follow orders mindlessly.
[00:26:22.794 --> 00:26:25.695]  But the system itself is there to destroy any free minds.
[00:26:26.075 --> 00:26:28.276]  This is a drone-like Brave New World system.
[00:26:28.977 --> 00:26:45.455]  And, of course, Aldous Huxley, who wrote Brave New World, said that he learned this from his brother, who was a big socialist, and the first Secretary General of UNESCO, after, of course, he'd written the book, that it was the government's plan to create this drone society, and now you see much of that developing.
[00:26:46.067 --> 00:26:46.788]  Pleasure to be here.
[00:27:10.817 --> 00:27:20.739]  Daniel, tell us first what happened, then we'll come back and talk about what's developed, a sense of this story came out in the New York Post.
[00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:31.901]  Basically, Alex, what happened was that my daughter, Angela, started part-time in college nine days after her eleventh birthday, concurrent with her regular grade schooling.
[00:27:33.201 --> 00:27:35.862]  When she entered eighth grade a year ago,
[00:27:38.101 --> 00:27:38.902]  I think so.
[00:27:56.601 --> 00:28:04.346]  The State Education Department said, sorry if you haven't been on this earth long enough, you cannot have a high school equivalency diploma.
[00:28:04.787 --> 00:28:11.851]  And I said to them, well that's ridiculous because a high school diploma is not supposed to, meant to be a substitute birth certificate.
[00:28:11.911 --> 00:28:24.300]  Well my dad had his high school accreditation and I mean he was off when he was a junior in high school at MD Anderson Cancer Research Facility as an intern.
[00:28:25.393 --> 00:28:28.316]  Well, let me say this much, Alex.
[00:28:28.336 --> 00:28:35.782]  The bottom line is that there are many states that are perhaps more enlightened than a major industrial state like New York.
[00:28:36.243 --> 00:28:43.369]  As a matter of fact, in my humble opinion, Judge Bernard Malone's decision demonstrated a depraved indifference to equal protection.
[00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:49.595]  There was no evidence he considered or even looked at petitioners' memorandum of law with research exhibits.
[00:28:50.879 --> 00:28:56.263]  Uh, apparently the judge is a guy whose mind was made up and he didn't want to be confused with the facts.
[00:28:56.923 --> 00:29:00.246]  The case I brought had nothing to do with the compulsory ed law.
[00:29:00.626 --> 00:29:09.852]  It had everything to do with an arbitrary and capricious age requirement for a high school diploma that was totally irrelevant to the academic achievement for the diploma.
[00:29:10.613 --> 00:29:15.336]  Now, the college can, uh, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the state, it is I, or I am the state.
[00:29:15.836 --> 00:29:18.398]  Malone's decision reeks of that attitude.
[00:29:19.153 --> 00:29:24.238]  It appears to me the guy went to law school and became a judge while blissfully ignorant of the Bill of Rights.
[00:29:24.919 --> 00:29:30.364]  Judges who turn a blind eye to equal protection under law are a disgrace to justice, the Constitution, and the judiciary.
[00:29:30.384 --> 00:29:34.468]  Malone's cynical decision only reinforces Lipsman's first rule of law.
[00:29:34.868 --> 00:29:36.410]  Law is whatever the judge says it is.
[00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.232]  Malone says I defy the law of the state.
[00:29:39.633 --> 00:29:40.614]  Guilty as charged.
[00:29:41.152 --> 00:29:45.453]  Not only that, but it seems to have escaped his notice that I had a duty to disobey this law.
[00:29:45.773 --> 00:29:46.554]  Daniel, stay there.
[00:29:46.574 --> 00:29:48.954]  We've got a... We've got a break, sir.
[00:29:48.974 --> 00:29:58.157]  I want to come back and talk about this, and we really appreciate you coming on with us, and of course we'll be able to talk to your daughter as well, Angela, and what this has been like for her.
[00:29:58.417 --> 00:29:59.157]  Please stay with us.
[00:30:00.538 --> 00:30:01.478]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.938 --> 00:30:03.559]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.459 --> 00:30:07.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.169 --> 00:30:14.290]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.012]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio is the answer.
[00:30:18.532 --> 00:30:21.293]  Featuring continuous tuning for all shortwave, frequent shortwave.
[00:30:21.333 --> 00:30:22.394]  The business doesn't have to.
[00:30:22.774 --> 00:30:25.135]  Call GCN today and get more customers tomorrow.
[00:30:36.397 --> 00:30:38.298]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:30:38.778 --> 00:30:41.599]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:46.381 --> 00:30:49.022]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:30:49.262 --> 00:30:54.925]  And I really appreciate Daniel Lipsman and his daughter, Angela Lipsman, coming on the show.
[00:30:55.145 --> 00:30:57.386]  Big article in the New York Post yesterday.
[00:30:57.406 --> 00:31:00.287]  It's on Infowars.com right now.
[00:31:00.307 --> 00:31:05.809]  A couple weeks ago they reported about the whiz kid who has a 3.8 grade average at college.
[00:31:06.784 --> 00:31:27.831]  She entered college at 11 while still going to the government training camp, the public school, and now she's graduated from college, and the government, the judge is saying she can't have her college diploma, she can't have her high school diploma, and CPS, Child Grabbing Services, has been called in for educational neglect.
[00:31:29.112 --> 00:31:35.394]  Now, Daniel Lipsman, and when your daughter would like to jump in any time, that's fine, this judge, as you said,
[00:31:36.598 --> 00:31:38.158]  Is just out of control.
[00:31:38.178 --> 00:31:43.239]  He wants to set the precedent that you've got to go to his, you know, his government-run system.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.401]  Well, the judge had the raw power to temporarily stop Angela from getting her diploma, Alex.
[00:31:48.701 --> 00:31:51.941]  Yet, this particular judge has no power to force her into high school.
[00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:57.822]  Despite this judicial travesty, Angela will continue her college program full-time in September.
[00:31:58.523 --> 00:32:00.463]  As for the New York City Department of Education,
[00:32:00.905 --> 00:32:10.187]  The Central School Superintendent, Joel Klein, has declined to respond to my efforts to settle a related administrative matter in the situation.
[00:32:10.567 --> 00:32:18.749]  There's been no response from him or his office in nearly six weeks to me, nor for over two weeks to the message sent to him by my local state senator.
[00:32:19.449 --> 00:32:23.970]  And parenthetically, he got a waiver to get his job as Central School Superintendent.
[00:32:24.415 --> 00:32:34.578]  Angela can't get a letter saying her 33 college courses and 71 credits for the 3.84 index plus two regions exams is the substantial equivalent of a New York City high school diploma.
[00:32:35.018 --> 00:32:37.598]  Let me turn you over to Angela now, Alex.
[00:32:38.439 --> 00:32:43.780]  And this is the young lady, 15 years old, who's trying to graduate from college with a 3.84.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:44.060]  And Angela,
[00:32:49.426 --> 00:32:56.333]  What has this been like to be a great student, to be a great daughter, and then to have the government come after your father and you?
[00:32:56.913 --> 00:32:57.274]  Your mother?
[00:32:57.294 --> 00:32:58.695]  Well, it's annoying.
[00:32:58.895 --> 00:33:12.769]  It hurts because you do the work, and you go to school, and you expect that you're going to get what you believe you have earned and deserve, and then all of a sudden they tell you, oh, no, wait, you're too young.
[00:33:12.809 --> 00:33:13.409]  You can't get it.
[00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.970]  Sorry.
[00:33:14.833 --> 00:33:24.057]  I thought they wanted people to be educated and to do good in school, but I guess their own documents don't say that, but those aren't publicized.
[00:33:24.978 --> 00:33:26.599]  When was CPS called in?
[00:33:26.659 --> 00:33:36.863]  The New York Post says that people read a news article and someone called in an anonymous tip that they thought that was abuse, that you were 15 and graduating from college.
[00:33:37.464 --> 00:33:39.805]  We found out about this in late June.
[00:33:40.225 --> 00:33:44.567]  Someone visited our home while we were outside.
[00:33:44.972 --> 00:33:47.435]  And we found the papers in the door when we got back.
[00:33:47.555 --> 00:33:48.897]  Oh, what papers were those?
[00:33:49.738 --> 00:33:50.959]  Let me jump in on that, Alex.
[00:33:52.061 --> 00:33:56.105]  It's from the Administration for Children's Services, Manhattan Division of Child Protection.
[00:33:56.886 --> 00:34:04.075]  And the start of the letter says, Dear Daniel Lipson, this is to inform you that you are the subject of a report of suspected child abuse and maltreatment.
[00:34:04.645 --> 00:34:06.326]  So, your daughter is graduating from college with a 3.84
[00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:36.966]  Well, it certainly isn't pleasant, that's for sure.
[00:34:55.622 --> 00:35:00.804]  You're the ones that are being abused, and you're being harassed, and I know you've had damages here.
[00:35:00.844 --> 00:35:02.504]  I know this has caused you a lot of anguish.
[00:35:02.724 --> 00:35:04.025]  You need to sue these people.
[00:35:04.985 --> 00:35:11.027]  Well, unfortunately, Alex, basically, I think they have a sort of sovereign tort immunity.
[00:35:11.407 --> 00:35:12.627]  They can claim that all day.
[00:35:12.667 --> 00:35:14.388]  That's not actually the case, even in New York.
[00:35:15.902 --> 00:35:17.243]  Because I've looked at the New York laws.
[00:35:17.303 --> 00:35:22.785]  They can claim, I mean, Hitler could claim he was sovereign and invincible.
[00:35:23.166 --> 00:35:24.066]  Stalin could say it.
[00:35:24.146 --> 00:35:25.207]  It doesn't mean it's the case.
[00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:32.670]  Well, I haven't had very good experiences so far in some of the courts of New York.
[00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:37.953]  I understand, but obviously I would imagine public opinion is on your side.
[00:35:38.193 --> 00:35:41.495]  The court of public opinion I think we're doing a lot better in.
[00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:45.433]  They don't think they care, Daniel Lipsman.
[00:35:45.553 --> 00:35:48.155]  I think they want everybody to have a chilling effect.
[00:35:48.375 --> 00:35:49.736]  That, hey, this is a message.
[00:35:49.776 --> 00:35:50.897]  We don't want you to do good.
[00:35:50.937 --> 00:35:52.098]  We want you to be an idiot.
[00:35:54.179 --> 00:35:55.340]  They may be succeeding.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.844]  They may be succeeding, unfortunately.
[00:36:00.604 --> 00:36:05.608]  But as long as there are people out there, Alex, such as yourself, that can get the message across,
[00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:14.316]  I think the media becomes an 800-pound gorilla that's good for fighting the 800-pound gorilla of the state.
[00:36:15.437 --> 00:36:24.165]  Now, Albany Supreme Court Justice Bernard Malone ruled Monday that because she's not 17, Angela is too young to obtain a high school diplomacy diploma.
[00:36:24.446 --> 00:36:26.988]  There's people in Texas I know that are 13 that get it.
[00:36:27.925 --> 00:36:28.726]  That's ridiculous.
[00:36:28.746 --> 00:36:33.028]  If you can take the test and pass it and get out of the system, why not?
[00:36:33.428 --> 00:36:36.269]  And then it goes back to whose children are they?
[00:36:36.289 --> 00:36:38.450]  Sometimes I wish we lived in Texas.
[00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.752]  Oh, well, it's getting bad here too, my friend.
[00:36:42.693 --> 00:36:48.776]  So when you talk to these bureaucrats, I mean, how do they abuse you like this and still sleep at night?
[00:36:50.436 --> 00:36:51.677]  That's a good question.
[00:36:53.138 --> 00:36:55.119]  Unfortunately, I'm not able to answer that.
[00:36:56.359 --> 00:36:57.360]  Let me say this, though.
[00:36:58.121 --> 00:37:03.505]  We are, the effects of this decision from Judge Malone.
[00:37:03.885 --> 00:37:10.690]  Judge Malone does not have the power to force Angela into a local crummy city high school.
[00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:17.295]  She will be taking a full five course, 15 credit program in the fall at the college where she is registered.
[00:37:18.215 --> 00:37:23.239]  And the only thing that, first of all, I will go to jail before she goes to a city high school.
[00:37:23.279 --> 00:37:24.840]  I've taken that vow and I mean it.
[00:37:25.481 --> 00:37:39.335]  But what would be required is for the government to move against us in New York City, home into court, and try to nail Mike Lyddius Maximus to the wall and say, look, you are violating compulsory ed law.
[00:37:39.435 --> 00:37:40.516]  We're going to put you in jail.
[00:37:40.536 --> 00:37:42.318]  We're going to take your daughter away.
[00:37:42.338 --> 00:37:44.740]  We will see what happens.
[00:37:45.874 --> 00:37:46.595]  Uh, in the future.
[00:37:46.615 --> 00:37:48.196]  I don't know how long it's going to be.
[00:37:48.477 --> 00:37:53.621]  So, the others, 15, 3.84 grade average, about to graduate with their first degree from college.
[00:37:54.082 --> 00:37:55.203]  That isn't good enough.
[00:37:55.283 --> 00:37:56.183]  That's bad.
[00:37:56.203 --> 00:37:59.787]  And they've started these, uh, I guess these criminal proceedings.
[00:38:00.227 --> 00:38:04.951]  Uh, any idea where this is going, uh, with the, uh, with the, uh, forces over there?
[00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:07.594]  No, Alex, but I will say one thing.
[00:38:07.674 --> 00:38:11.217]  I think that, uh, with programs like yourself and, uh, other media,
[00:38:12.378 --> 00:38:32.705]  It may be giving some of these individuals second thoughts because almost all of the feedback, in fact all of the feedback that I know of that we've received so far, whether it was in the form of email, whether it was radio stations, television, word of mouth, everything in terms of the public has so far been positive.
[00:38:33.185 --> 00:38:37.647]  Now what does this say though about the government's mindset, and I see this all over the country, not just New York,
[00:38:38.422 --> 00:38:58.627]  Where your daughter is, there's a great photo over here, you know, energetic, beautiful, smart, all of this, and, I mean, there's lots of children, young adults that are graduating from college at 14, 15, 16, thousands of them, and your daughter is in that top 1%.
[00:38:59.187 --> 00:39:01.088]  I mean, this is asinine!
[00:39:02.068 --> 00:39:03.249]  This is ridiculous!
[00:39:03.469 --> 00:39:04.670]  This makes me really angry!
[00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:06.731]  These people ought to be ashamed of themselves!
[00:39:07.971 --> 00:39:10.153]  I'm trying to get to the mindset of these people!
[00:39:10.373 --> 00:39:12.314]  Well, they don't want the competition, Alex.
[00:39:12.854 --> 00:39:21.779]  Because the sooner these people get out of school and get into the labor force, they will be competing for those nice prizes out there in society.
[00:39:22.819 --> 00:39:28.182]  Whether it's in medicine, law, journalism, on college faculties,
[00:39:29.156 --> 00:39:38.324]  The point is that you're taking the best and the brightest, and you're allowing them to compete with some of these educrats who are very uncomfortable.
[00:39:38.644 --> 00:39:42.608]  Also, you're goring the ox, if you will.
[00:39:43.409 --> 00:39:55.039]  For example, if you have Angela graduating four years early, and you replicate this over and over and over again, you have a situation where you don't need so many teachers in front of the classroom.
[00:39:55.626 --> 00:40:02.868]  And you don't need the schools being turned into little mini prison camps training the children how to be prisoners.
[00:40:03.348 --> 00:40:04.688]  What do you say about that, Angela?
[00:40:05.949 --> 00:40:09.729]  Well, that sounds accurate in some situations.
[00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:11.870]  What are New York schools like?
[00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.591]  I know there are little prisons here in a lot of areas of Texas.
[00:40:15.331 --> 00:40:18.012]  Well, there's a bit of a variance.
[00:40:18.092 --> 00:40:23.753]  You have the local high schools where you would have more things on the side.
[00:40:24.905 --> 00:40:28.026]  And you have the specialized high schools where you have more homework.
[00:40:28.766 --> 00:40:34.327]  But you don't want to be shaken down by the gang members and the police in these public schools?
[00:40:35.287 --> 00:40:35.547]  Yeah.
[00:40:35.867 --> 00:40:43.969]  You don't want to learn how to... I mean, because, you know, you will learn, I guess, all the horrible things that go on in these high schools.
[00:40:45.369 --> 00:40:48.889]  Well, that was one of the things I wanted to avoid.
[00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:51.070]  You don't want that type of socialization, I guess.
[00:40:52.756 --> 00:40:54.557]  You know, there's a big report out on daycare.
[00:40:54.998 --> 00:40:59.421]  Just throwing your kid into a daycare and it says they're like, you know, many times more likely to be violent.
[00:40:59.922 --> 00:41:03.885]  I think it speaks to parents educating and raising their children.
[00:41:04.065 --> 00:41:05.567]  Oh, wow, what a novel idea.
[00:41:05.587 --> 00:41:10.631]  And I guess that, I mean, as your father said, it's competition to their monopoly.
[00:41:13.493 --> 00:41:14.594]  That's the truth, Alex.
[00:41:16.075 --> 00:41:21.720]  Any idea on who, quote, filed this anonymous Stasi-type report?
[00:41:23.128 --> 00:41:24.989]  I mean, again, your daughter's in the newspaper.
[00:41:25.029 --> 00:41:26.810]  Oh, look how young and smart she is.
[00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:35.535]  3.84, you know, graduating from college at 15, in college at 11, and then suddenly the police and the CPS are after you.
[00:41:35.795 --> 00:41:39.657]  I mean, I would imagine that this was probably a complaint filed by a CPS worker.
[00:41:39.677 --> 00:41:40.178]  What do you think?
[00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:45.241]  I think it's entirely possible.
[00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:49.143]  The bottom line is that when I started this,
[00:41:50.202 --> 00:41:57.468]  I didn't wind up making any friends among the establishment, among the educrats.
[00:41:58.252 --> 00:42:00.974]  And I did, in fact, openly defy them.
[00:42:01.014 --> 00:42:03.697]  Did I break the law on paper officially?
[00:42:03.757 --> 00:42:04.517]  Yes, I did.
[00:42:04.978 --> 00:42:05.919]  Guilty as charged.
[00:42:06.359 --> 00:42:16.407]  The bottom line is that I have stood there and said, I am not going to comply with the compulsory education law, as you folks have interpreted it.
[00:42:16.427 --> 00:42:19.570]  Well, they had laws that black people couldn't drink out of water fountains.
[00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.792]  So does that mean those laws are good?
[00:42:22.212 --> 00:42:24.254]  Well, that's precisely the point, Alex.
[00:42:24.594 --> 00:42:27.036]  When you have a law that says that,
[00:42:28.174 --> 00:42:32.655]  Uh, you know, sure, that was on the books, but the point is that it was declared unconstitutional.
[00:42:32.695 --> 00:42:34.756]  In other words, they didn't have the right to pass such a law.
[00:42:35.096 --> 00:42:37.496]  And the argument we're making is the very same thing.
[00:42:37.837 --> 00:42:47.339]  That the government didn't have the right to pass a compulsory... For example, it's supposed to be a compulsory education law on the books, not a compulsory attendance law.
[00:42:48.301 --> 00:42:56.069]  The only people that I know that are serving compulsory attendance are those that have been convicted of felonies and misdemeanors and they've been sentenced for a crime.
[00:42:56.389 --> 00:42:57.811]  Yeah, but that's really what they're doing.
[00:42:57.891 --> 00:43:00.694]  High school's not supposed to be a prison.
[00:43:00.994 --> 00:43:02.936]  Well, you ought to read the federal documents.
[00:43:02.976 --> 00:43:04.297]  That's exactly what they are.
[00:43:04.398 --> 00:43:05.659]  You just hit on it.
[00:43:06.099 --> 00:43:09.463]  Just with your own native intelligence without even seeing the documents, sir.
[00:43:09.904 --> 00:43:23.540]  I have UNESCO, Department of Education, and I got Senate hearings a hundred years ago where they said it's about molding minds for this mass, you know, basic system for the state.
[00:43:24.582 --> 00:43:31.404]  So, I mean, what you just said is exactly what they have stated, and the teachers are dumbed down and go, oh, I'm not doing that.
[00:43:31.424 --> 00:43:40.386]  Well, you're following the orders in a compartmentalized system that deploys and develops that type of mass mind control.
[00:43:41.107 --> 00:43:44.368]  Angela Lipsman, any other comments that you'd like to make to the audience?
[00:43:44.468 --> 00:43:48.309]  Or Daniel Lipsman, your father, any final comments for the listeners?
[00:43:49.089 --> 00:43:49.969]  Angela?
[00:43:53.387 --> 00:43:57.168]  I believe that the decision that came down was unfair.
[00:43:57.188 --> 00:44:17.235]  Obviously, I don't think the judge believes the same, but I just hope that this turns out for the best and that other students out there will be able to pursue their education however is best for them.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.462]  As for me, Alex, my view is very simple.
[00:44:22.323 --> 00:44:24.245]  We have a constitution.
[00:44:24.585 --> 00:44:27.327]  We're supposed to be living by that constitution.
[00:44:27.788 --> 00:44:30.190]  And the judge is supposed to uphold the constitution.
[00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:45.963]  And when you get a decision like this that says the law is whatever I say it is, and what's constitutional or not is whatever I say it is, that's disgraceful and brings disgrace to the black robe that the judge wears.
[00:44:47.444 --> 00:44:52.508]  Sir, you know somebody can walk in and take the bar and if they can pass it they can become a lawyer without going to law school.
[00:44:52.789 --> 00:44:58.954]  You know somebody can get into medical school even if they haven't finished college if the examiners believe that they're up to par.
[00:44:59.895 --> 00:45:06.981]  Now, I don't know about the particular laws in New York on this, but I believe the college can go ahead and give her her diploma that she's earned with an 8.4 GPA.
[00:45:08.562 --> 00:45:09.103]  A 3.84?
[00:45:09.363 --> 00:45:27.255]  Well, unfortunately, Alex, they also have a law in place in New York that says that without having a high school diploma first, or its equivalent, you cannot get your college degree, and this college would be shut down immediately if they issued her degree without that.
[00:45:27.575 --> 00:45:29.016]  Wow, New York really is bad.
[00:45:29.316 --> 00:45:29.596]  Yeah.
[00:45:29.736 --> 00:45:34.580]  You've got the bureaucrats telling the professors and the deans, this is out of control.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.461]  This is out of control.
[00:45:37.392 --> 00:45:38.213]  Well, it's simple.
[00:45:38.273 --> 00:45:38.933]  It's a business.
[00:45:38.993 --> 00:45:45.599]  They want a monopoly of their quasi, you know, re-education slash preparation for the penal colony system.
[00:45:45.979 --> 00:45:47.760]  That's what the public schools are.
[00:45:49.261 --> 00:45:49.822]  I'm serious.
[00:45:49.862 --> 00:45:52.704]  And they're trying to destroy your daughter's future.
[00:45:53.285 --> 00:45:58.869]  Mr. Lipsman, I think you have massive, massive damages if they continue this.
[00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:00.030]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:46:00.698 --> 00:46:11.385]  For folks that might want to, we have a lot of lawyers, a lot of people that listen to this show, we have a couple of affiliates in upstate New York, three of them were on in Buffalo and Rochester and Niagara.
[00:46:11.705 --> 00:46:23.793]  For folks that might want to call the governor or the school board or the city, the legislature, for folks that want to support you in New York, how do they do that?
[00:46:24.293 --> 00:46:36.959]  Well, what I would suggest is that they write their state senator and state assemblyman, particularly the state senators, and say, see here, we have a constitution.
[00:46:37.701 --> 00:46:39.482]  And it should be respected.
[00:46:40.343 --> 00:46:44.325]  We have a way of reversing the effects of this decision.
[00:46:44.886 --> 00:46:52.831]  And the way to do that is to have the state legislature pass a rule which... That your children are your children and you control their education.
[00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:56.453]  Now, real quick, give an email address for folks that might want to contact you.
[00:46:57.714 --> 00:46:59.595]  Angela, do you have your email address?
[00:47:01.116 --> 00:47:01.256]  Yeah.
[00:47:01.917 --> 00:47:02.277]  Okay.
[00:47:03.157 --> 00:47:04.018]  Would you like to give it out?
[00:47:05.777 --> 00:47:07.078]  I mean, you don't have to.
[00:47:07.098 --> 00:47:10.940]  I'm just saying people might send you guys some federal rulings, state rulings.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:15.383]  Well, no, the problem, Alex, is that she shares it with two other kids, and they may not want to.
[00:47:15.543 --> 00:47:16.644]  Oh, I understand now.
[00:47:17.044 --> 00:47:20.406]  Well, if folks want to get a hold of you, I'm sure they can find out how to do it.
[00:47:20.567 --> 00:47:21.927]  I can give my address, though.
[00:47:22.168 --> 00:47:22.868]  I don't mind that.
[00:47:23.108 --> 00:47:23.649]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:47:23.669 --> 00:47:35.216]  It's Daniel Lipsman, L-I-P-S-M-A-N, 4420 Broadway, Apartment 4F, as in Frank, New York City, New York.
[00:47:36.426 --> 00:47:42.068]  1-0-0-4-0, and I'll be glad to respond to anybody and everybody that I can.
[00:47:42.148 --> 00:47:52.552]  Well, if more Americans stood up and really loved their children, and now you're a young adult, and really cared, and if more people were focused like your daughter, we would live in a free society.
[00:47:52.572 --> 00:47:56.454]  But I'm telling you, Mr. Lipsman, we're losing America, and I think you recognize that.
[00:47:56.914 --> 00:48:02.636]  And to get America back, more Americans have to recognize that, and hopefully before they get squashed
[00:48:03.196 --> 00:48:04.937]  By this, uh, this corrupt system.
[00:48:05.178 --> 00:48:06.218]  Thank you for coming on the show.
[00:48:06.398 --> 00:48:07.139]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:48:07.479 --> 00:48:07.999]  God bless you.
[00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:09.881]  And, uh, Angela, you take care and keep it up.
[00:48:10.241 --> 00:48:10.721]  Okay, thanks.
[00:48:10.881 --> 00:48:11.382]  Bye-bye.
[00:48:12.782 --> 00:48:14.604]  Alright, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:14.624 --> 00:48:16.645]  I mean, you talk about the criminality of government.
[00:48:16.685 --> 00:48:18.206]  Here's another example of it.
[00:48:19.067 --> 00:48:20.507]  Tell me it's not out of control.
[00:48:20.948 --> 00:48:28.212]  Tell me that the goal isn't to dumb your children down and to hold them back and to turn them into mindless, drooling sports fans.
[00:48:28.773 --> 00:48:30.414]  We'll be right back with more news, more info.
[00:48:31.306 --> 00:48:31.966]  Commodities.
[00:48:32.427 --> 00:48:33.027]  Futures.
[00:48:33.687 --> 00:48:34.207]  Options.
[00:48:34.988 --> 00:48:40.370]  While most people are acquainted with stocks and mutual funds, the commodities markets remain a mystery.
[00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.071]  It's one Barclay Financial can help solve.
[00:48:43.592 --> 00:48:48.474]  Futures and options investing involve substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.
[00:48:48.974 --> 00:48:51.435]  I'm Patrick T. Parker for Barclay Financial.
[00:48:51.815 --> 00:48:52.916]  Right now the U.S.
[00:48:53.016 --> 00:48:57.558]  trade deficit and budget deficits are rising to historical levels.
[00:48:58.078 --> 00:49:03.060]  Interest rates are at some of the lowest levels we have ever seen, and yet the economy is still weak.
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:05.821]  And we feel this could spell trouble for the dollar.
[00:49:06.162 --> 00:49:09.383]  To Barclay Financial, that spells opportunity.
[00:49:09.823 --> 00:49:11.944]  The European currency has been on the rise.
[00:49:12.004 --> 00:49:18.227]  We feel it will keep on rising, and as a result, we're recommending the purchase of call options on the euro currency.
[00:49:18.527 --> 00:49:21.973]  For a free special market report on the euro currency, call 1-800-348-4100.
[00:49:22.053 --> 00:49:22.254]  That's 1-800-348-4100.
[00:49:22.294 --> 00:49:22.674]  Barclay Financial.
[00:49:22.694 --> 00:49:23.175]  Mystery Solved.
[00:49:32.654 --> 00:49:37.157]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:49:37.497 --> 00:49:41.579]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:42.440]  We listened.
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:47.723]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:48.003 --> 00:49:48.483]  We listened.
[00:49:48.884 --> 00:49:51.905]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:52.346 --> 00:49:52.846]  We listened.
[00:49:53.326 --> 00:49:57.388]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:49:57.768 --> 00:49:58.248]  We listened.
[00:49:58.608 --> 00:50:03.830]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:05.631]  Again, we listened.
[00:50:05.971 --> 00:50:13.354]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:50:13.734 --> 00:50:17.816]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at

[00:50:31.878 --> 00:50:39.260]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:44.262]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:50:44.482 --> 00:50:50.124]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:50:50.424 --> 00:50:50.564]  I think?
[00:51:06.998 --> 00:51:09.521]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:51:09.721 --> 00:51:16.487]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our Constitutional Republic.
[00:51:16.687 --> 00:51:21.951]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:21.971 --> 00:51:22.372]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:34.085 --> 00:51:40.110]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:43.733]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:46.575 --> 00:51:52.420]  Coming up, eight minutes into the next hour, we have Dr. David Race Bannon coming on.
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:57.684]  Race Against Evil, the secret missions of the Interpol agent who tracked the world's most sinister criminals.
[00:52:00.348 --> 00:52:13.934]  I don't really know what to say about this whole story because what I think of Interpol and what I know about the UN and who's involved in a lot of the crimes listed in this book, but we'll find out with the guests.
[00:52:14.014 --> 00:52:14.734]  It should be interesting.
[00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:19.294]  I know we've got Ron in New York and Dan in California and others that are holding.
[00:52:19.314 --> 00:52:20.035]  We'll get to you too.
[00:52:20.415 --> 00:52:22.017]  The guest is coming in about eight minutes to the next hour.
[00:52:22.637 --> 00:52:25.720]  Real quick, my new film, Police State, three total enslavements out.
[00:52:25.781 --> 00:52:28.523]  My book, Descent into Tyranny, is out, covering 9-1-1.
[00:52:29.064 --> 00:52:34.069]  And you need to get these films and my book, make copies of the films, get them out to people and expose this great evil.
[00:52:34.449 --> 00:52:39.131]  The toll-free number to get my videos is 888-253-3139.
[00:52:39.211 --> 00:52:46.675]  That's 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or NIT.
[00:52:46.775 --> 00:52:51.017]  Please take action if you're angry about this corruption and help expose it at the grassroots level.
[00:52:51.277 --> 00:52:52.678]  That's where all change takes place.
[00:52:53.278 --> 00:52:59.582]  We'll be right back with the next hour here in just a few minutes with your calls and the guests and just a lot of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:53:00.022 --> 00:53:02.824]  But right now, just for the next few minutes, please get your pens and paper ready.
[00:53:03.624 --> 00:53:15.992]  Jim Shepard's joining us to talk about a specialties offering with the British Berkey's high quality water filters that I use myself and the new Berkey light that's rechargeable with the lights in the water filter with the solar panel.
[00:53:16.792 --> 00:53:17.633]  Great systems.
[00:53:17.893 --> 00:53:19.174]  Jim, tell them all about it, please.
[00:53:21.374 --> 00:53:23.055]  Again, we have Jim Shepard with us.
[00:53:24.775 --> 00:53:25.315]  Can you hear me?
[00:53:25.415 --> 00:53:26.156]  Yes, I can.
[00:53:26.176 --> 00:53:26.556]  Go ahead.
[00:53:26.676 --> 00:53:26.996]  Okay.
[00:53:27.856 --> 00:53:31.237]  Well, the Berkey Light is actually a true water purifier.
[00:53:31.437 --> 00:53:38.519]  In fact, we tested it at 10,000 times the bacteriological contamination that one would normally test a water filter.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:46.242]  According to that test, we would expect to see over 100,000 microbes left in the water if it were a filter.
[00:53:47.214 --> 00:53:50.517]  And to the surprise of everyone, not one microbe got through.
[00:53:50.797 --> 00:53:52.019]  Absolutely non-detect.
[00:53:52.079 --> 00:53:54.221]  Couldn't find anything with electron microscope.
[00:53:54.841 --> 00:53:56.703]  It is a true water purifier.
[00:53:56.723 --> 00:54:05.270]  Not only does it take out microbes, but also herbicides, pesticides, nitrates, nitrites, heavy metals, all the bad stuff you don't want in there.
[00:54:05.871 --> 00:54:09.214]  What we did, Alex, is we also put some LED lights in there.
[00:54:09.634 --> 00:54:12.357]  LED lights are a new technology.
[00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:16.322]  They have 11-year continuous average life.
[00:54:16.562 --> 00:54:19.404]  So, if you ran it continuously, they would last 11 years.
[00:54:20.064 --> 00:54:23.685]  Use them 8 hours a night, they'll last 33 years.
[00:54:24.586 --> 00:54:26.066]  And they're very low energy.
[00:54:26.626 --> 00:54:37.191]  And so, it has its own internal batteries, but with a set of 4 batteries in the battery adapter, it will give you light for 2 weeks.
[00:54:37.851 --> 00:54:40.312]  Very inexpensive light during emergencies.
[00:54:41.204 --> 00:54:44.066]  And it makes a fantastic nightlight.
[00:54:44.366 --> 00:54:45.547]  Tell them about the two specials.
[00:54:45.567 --> 00:54:46.668]  We've got a minute and a half left.
[00:54:46.948 --> 00:54:47.688]  Okay.
[00:54:48.569 --> 00:54:50.890]  We're introducing the solar panel that will charge it.
[00:54:51.351 --> 00:55:00.076]  And so basically for the next 33 years, you've got light and you also have power that will... The solar panel will also charge your cell phone, so you've got communications.
[00:55:00.657 --> 00:55:03.659]  It'll also do radio, so you've got power for small equipment.
[00:55:04.099 --> 00:55:06.020]  You've got the light and you've got the power.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.141]  And this is the special.

[00:55:57.627 --> 00:55:58.367]  Anything else, Jim?
[00:55:58.628 --> 00:55:59.768]  No, thanks very much, Alex.
[00:55:59.908 --> 00:56:00.628]  Keep up the good work.
[00:56:00.849 --> 00:56:01.689]  Thank you, my friend.
[00:56:02.289 --> 00:56:05.831]  It's a great product, and it also supports the show, and I have these systems myself.
[00:56:05.851 --> 00:56:07.011]  I mean, it's just a great deal.
[00:56:07.031 --> 00:56:08.772]  888-803-4438.
[00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:14.935]  We'll be right back with the second hour, your calls, the guests, a bunch of news.
[00:56:15.495 --> 00:56:17.096]  Second and third hours, straight ahead.
[00:56:17.216 --> 00:56:17.936]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:56:17.956 --> 00:56:18.396]  Stay with me.
[00:56:18.676 --> 00:56:19.897]  InfoWars.com.
[00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:25.714]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:56:25.954 --> 00:56:31.399]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:56:31.679 --> 00:56:39.627]  Ideal for tri... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.184 --> 00:56:47.824]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.484 --> 00:56:49.524]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.244 --> 00:56:51.345]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.005 --> 00:56:52.825]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.586 --> 00:56:54.486]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.506 --> 00:56:58.907]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.327 --> 00:57:03.449]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:03.989 --> 00:57:08.290]  Okay, we got a great guest coming up in just a few minutes and a bunch of news.
[00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:09.971]  Let's go right to the calls right now.
[00:57:10.151 --> 00:57:11.211]  Ron in New York, quickly.
[00:57:11.231 --> 00:57:11.751]  You're on the air.
[00:57:11.791 --> 00:57:12.211]  Go ahead.
[00:57:13.652 --> 00:57:14.012]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:14.722 --> 00:57:16.524]  I'm glad to see that you had that gentleman on today.
[00:57:16.904 --> 00:57:23.609]  Oh yeah, it's illegal now to have your 15-year-old with a 3.84 rate average, so the government's coming after him with CPS.
[00:57:23.709 --> 00:57:24.870]  Well, I'm going to tell you something.
[00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:31.675]  There's a few things there you should get some really good legal counsel, both in New York State education law and constitutional law.
[00:57:32.716 --> 00:57:38.040]  And he kind of is, with his own, as you said, native intelligence deriving at some conclusions that are accurate.
[00:57:38.951 --> 00:57:42.393]  First thing that he was wrong on, though, is he said New York can't be sued.
[00:57:42.413 --> 00:57:42.993]  It's a sovereign.
[00:57:43.453 --> 00:57:44.714]  New York is not a sovereign state.
[00:57:45.934 --> 00:57:49.596]  Well, I mean, of course government claims you can't sue them, but they lose suits all the time.
[00:57:49.856 --> 00:57:52.857]  Alex, in the state of New York, they can't even claim that.
[00:57:53.017 --> 00:57:54.038]  It's not a sovereign state.
[00:57:54.698 --> 00:57:55.899]  Georgia's a sovereign state.
[00:57:56.019 --> 00:57:57.599]  The United States government is a sovereign.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.080]  New York is not a sovereign.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.941]  That's commonly known for a very long time.
[00:58:01.201 --> 00:58:05.763]  He can sue any executive agency such as Child Protective Services in the state of New York.
[00:58:06.323 --> 00:58:07.804]  No, but of course they'll tell you you can't.
[00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:10.411]  Well, they can say what they want.
[00:58:10.491 --> 00:58:12.392]  Okay, real quick, Ron, anything else?
[00:58:12.772 --> 00:58:28.100]  Yes, secondly, believe it or not, aside from his constitutional and educational arguments that he has, there is a process by which, because the educational law, which I'm familiar with, states the minimums that are required in order to get a high school diploma.
[00:58:29.173 --> 00:58:31.155]  His daughter exceeded the minimum.
[00:58:31.175 --> 00:58:32.155]  See, they don't set a maximum.
[00:58:32.336 --> 00:58:35.158]  They want to punish her because it sets a precedent.
[00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:35.838]  Thanks for the call.
[00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:37.640]  They want your kid dumbed down.
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.001]  They want them in the prison system.
[00:58:39.401 --> 00:58:43.485]  Schools, public schools, are a preparatory system for prison.
[00:58:43.505 --> 00:58:44.545]  And this is admitted, folks.
[00:58:45.286 --> 00:58:47.588]  Dave in California, in Northern California.
[00:58:47.628 --> 00:58:47.928]  Welcome.
[00:58:48.389 --> 00:58:48.849]  Howdy, Alex.
[00:58:49.089 --> 00:58:49.650]  Hello, Dave.
[00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:53.733]  I just wanted to congratulate you on your excellent interview with Ann Coulter last week.
[00:58:54.712 --> 00:58:59.274]  The level of discourse I heard from her is a good example of the dumbing down of America that you're discussing right now.
[00:58:59.294 --> 00:59:00.574]  Yes, a babbling neocon.
[00:59:00.934 --> 00:59:07.536]  Yes, and I just wanted to tell you that I was thrilled to hear her honking and flapping like a goose that's been run over by a truck.
[00:59:09.817 --> 00:59:10.918]  You know, it doesn't surprise me.
[00:59:10.938 --> 00:59:13.639]  Did we expose her as the liberal she is?
[00:59:14.379 --> 00:59:15.619]  Do I use her own term?
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.740]  Yeah, you did a great job.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.101]  You let her dig her own ditch and you bulldozed her into it.
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:26.043]  And I love the dumb blonde question you asked at the beginning, and I was kind of wondering, you know, where's he going with this?
[00:59:26.103 --> 00:59:33.687]  And then at the end, you know, you left her exposed as either the dumb blonde that she is or the dumb blonde she claims to be because she didn't have any facts.
[00:59:34.908 --> 00:59:39.971]  And the Bush mascot thing was nice, and the neocon thing was nice.
[00:59:40.051 --> 00:59:42.833]  All in all, I mean, I give you an A-plus on that, man.
[00:59:42.933 --> 00:59:44.894]  It was really nice to hear for a change.
[00:59:45.034 --> 00:59:46.355]  Everybody loved that.
[00:59:46.375 --> 00:59:48.857]  Look, we've got more neocons coming on for you.
[00:59:49.257 --> 00:59:50.838]  I'm going to have all of them on the show.
[00:59:51.158 --> 00:59:51.758]  Oh, that's great.
[00:59:51.778 --> 00:59:53.699]  Well, I'll be sure and listen to you every day.
[00:59:54.059 --> 00:59:57.581]  Both large and small neokinds will be on display.
[00:59:57.641 --> 00:59:58.241]  Thank you, Dave.
[00:59:58.401 --> 00:59:59.062]  Okay, see you, man.
[00:59:59.082 --> 00:59:59.842]  Appreciate it, brother.
[01:00:00.462 --> 01:00:02.523]  Bill in Wisconsin, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:00:02.563 --> 01:00:02.963]  Go ahead.
[01:00:03.383 --> 01:00:07.385]  Yeah, Alex, I just want to agree with the last caller there.
[01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:10.266]  You did a tremendous job on her.
[01:00:10.346 --> 01:00:11.487]  I just can't stand her.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.481]  She really thinks she's something, and, uh, you did a job.
[01:00:15.722 --> 01:00:17.822]  She said, she said, I haven't read the Patriot Act.
[01:00:17.842 --> 01:00:19.703]  I said, well, you want me to read you a subsection?
[01:00:19.823 --> 01:00:20.123]  No.
[01:00:20.564 --> 01:00:23.145]  I go, but you wrote in your book about how it doesn't take our rights.
[01:00:23.585 --> 01:00:23.905]  Yeah.
[01:00:23.925 --> 01:00:24.985]  And how we're liars.
[01:00:25.426 --> 01:00:25.786]  Yeah.
[01:00:25.806 --> 01:00:28.387]  And I said, don't tell me it's about Hillary Clinton.
[01:00:28.427 --> 01:00:29.627]  Hillary Clinton voted for it.
[01:00:29.908 --> 01:00:30.168]  Right.
[01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:34.970]  Another thing that she said, uh, Republicans always end the wars.
[01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:38.031]  Well, Nixon ended that Vietnam War, didn't he?
[01:00:38.878 --> 01:00:46.588]  Uh, you go back and look at the tapes of the poor Vietnamese people trying to get on these helicopters as we left them to the commies.
[01:00:47.049 --> 01:00:50.614]  And then about 500,000 were executed by the commies.
[01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:51.134]  Right.
[01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:55.079]  And then our troops got left there, but that's again, that's a conservative thing to do.
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:55.640]  Right.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.942]  And then on McCarthy,
[01:00:57.589 --> 01:01:00.871]  It was Dwight Eisenhower who knifed McCarthy in the back.
[01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:02.612]  Yeah, see, she wanted to, and she had to admit that.
[01:01:02.653 --> 01:01:04.154]  She goes, okay, well, I'm not going to get into that.
[01:01:04.414 --> 01:01:11.238]  Yeah, it was the Republicans that finally did him in when he exposed that they were above the liberals and above the communists.
[01:01:11.699 --> 01:01:14.961]  It just came out on the national news here the other day.
[01:01:14.981 --> 01:01:20.485]  And, you know, we've known about it for quite some time, but Harry Truman did not want to run again.
[01:01:20.505 --> 01:01:23.887]  And actually, in 1948, didn't want to run.
[01:01:24.338 --> 01:01:25.599]  He wanted Dwight Eisenhower.
[01:01:25.639 --> 01:01:26.520]  Yeah, that was the letter.
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.103]  It showed the Democrats and Republicans staging elections.
[01:01:30.424 --> 01:01:30.644]  Yeah.
[01:01:30.824 --> 01:01:33.326]  They just found another one of his certified diaries.
[01:01:33.647 --> 01:01:33.887]  Right.
[01:01:34.087 --> 01:01:34.688]  The diary.
[01:01:34.748 --> 01:01:34.928]  Right.
[01:01:34.948 --> 01:01:35.789]  Yeah, I was reading that.
[01:01:35.809 --> 01:01:37.190]  He had some other interesting stuff to say.
[01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:37.791]  Right.
[01:01:37.891 --> 01:01:38.631]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:38.671 --> 01:01:39.092]  Thanks, brother.
[01:01:42.779 --> 01:01:44.400]  Are you losing your hair like me?

[01:02:33.547 --> 01:02:37.249]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:39.791]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:39.811 --> 01:02:40.651]  There is a chance
[01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:56.086]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:02:56.126 --> 01:02:57.469]  The New World Order?
[01:02:58.294 --> 01:02:59.235]  Panama!
[01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:03.498]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:03:03.558 --> 01:03:10.483]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:03:10.623 --> 01:03:12.685]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:03:13.005 --> 01:03:23.453]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[01:04:55.939 --> 01:04:57.741]  Alright folks, we're back live.

[01:04:59.482 --> 01:05:04.906]  And I'd like to ask the folks running the show, do we have our next... We do have our next guest.
[01:05:04.946 --> 01:05:05.567]  Well, that's good.
[01:05:07.628 --> 01:05:08.909]  Very interesting information.
[01:05:08.949 --> 01:05:22.981]  You know, on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we've posted AP, Reuters, United Press International, BBC stories about major corporations
[01:05:24.364 --> 01:05:27.066]  The United Nations, U.N.
[01:05:27.106 --> 01:05:30.729]  peacekeepers and others running giant white slavery rings.
[01:05:30.809 --> 01:05:32.230]  Now, this is all mainstream news.
[01:05:32.851 --> 01:05:34.993]  They've caught the Dutch royal family involved in it.
[01:05:35.093 --> 01:05:36.053]  That's BBC.
[01:05:36.093 --> 01:05:42.178]  They've caught major governors and mayors in France doing things we can't even mention on the air.
[01:05:42.859 --> 01:05:46.982]  But it's hard for the average American to believe stuff like this.
[01:05:47.002 --> 01:05:51.646]  You know, it was hard to believe what John Wayne Gacy did, or Ted Bundy.
[01:05:52.364 --> 01:05:58.952]  But throughout history you find elites are involved in this more often than the common man or woman.
[01:06:00.433 --> 01:06:02.275]  So the common man or woman is in denial.
[01:06:04.372 --> 01:06:30.429]  I had a chance to read some of his book, I just got it last week, and it's Race Against Evil, the secret missions of the Interpol agent who tracked the world's most cynical criminals, and I know there's good people in government, I know the government in some areas does fight this stuff, and in some areas I've found government involved in it and government protecting it, but he also got into anti-terrorism and KAL 858 bombing and a bunch of others, it's an amazing story.
[01:06:31.423 --> 01:06:35.684]  And so we'll talk about that coming up with our guest here in a few minutes.
[01:06:35.864 --> 01:06:43.787]  And yes, we'll take calls and talk about the development of possible World War III with North Korea, Syria, Iran, and much more.
[01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:48.208]  With the former Defense Secretary saying, quote, nukes will go off in the U.S.
[01:06:48.268 --> 01:06:50.229]  I mean, this is chilling stuff.
[01:06:50.469 --> 01:06:52.789]  And that is from the Washington Post, by the way.
[01:06:52.809 --> 01:06:54.850]  I haven't really spent enough time on that since Monday.
[01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:56.190]  This has been out since Monday.
[01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:57.191]  I've mentioned it a few times.
[01:06:57.231 --> 01:06:58.011]  I wanted to tail it.
[01:06:59.321 --> 01:07:24.354]  Before we go any further with our guest, I do want to invite the listeners out there to stop procrastinating and to go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and to get my book, 9-1-1 Dissent into Tyranny, that covers what was really behind the September 11th attacks and who stands to gain, and the evidence, the smoking gun evidence, that proves
[01:07:25.633 --> 01:07:31.315]  That this global shadow crime syndicate was controlling and orchestrating that to bring in the New World Order.
[01:07:31.335 --> 01:07:36.337]  I also have my film, 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Part 2 of that.
[01:07:36.777 --> 01:07:39.218]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement, just came out.
[01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:41.399]  So be sure and don't procrastinate.
[01:07:41.459 --> 01:07:44.640]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:51.083]  It's all just mainstream, in-your-face admitted, but the news never takes it all and combines it all together.
[01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:58.512]  So go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and to get the films or call toll free to get them at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:07:58.532 --> 01:07:58.972]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:07:58.992 --> 01:07:59.952]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.
[01:08:00.193 --> 01:08:02.213]  That's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:08:20.559 --> 01:08:24.823]  And as Patrick Henry said, we need the strength to face the truth, no matter how horrible.
[01:08:25.423 --> 01:08:31.848]  Because there's a lot more security and safety in facing the horror, in facing the truth, than going along with it.
[01:08:32.869 --> 01:08:42.977]  And let me just read some of the excerpts now, or the description of Race Against Evil, the secret mission of the Interpol agent who tracked the world's most sinister criminals.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:57.162]  And this electric narrative of suspense and intrigue delivers a first-hand account of heinous criminals and stern justice from the insider's view of David Race Bannon.
[01:08:57.182 --> 01:09:03.823]  At the age of 19, the American youth is recruited by Interpol after he is caught in a deadly riot in South Korea.
[01:09:03.843 --> 01:09:13.025]  Over the next 15 years, Bannon is trained to work in the darkest regions of humanity, deny society's inhibitors against
[01:09:13.918 --> 01:09:21.503]  Killing and embrace the agency's role as deliverer of grim justice to evildoers beyond the reach of the law.
[01:09:22.244 --> 01:09:37.314]  His assignments take him from the slave houses of Thailand and the disappearance of London's most notorious child pornographer to investigating the KAL 858 bombing and tracking terrorists and criminals in the United States.
[01:09:38.095 --> 01:09:40.156]  And it's an interesting book, to say the least.
[01:09:40.856 --> 01:09:52.140]  And again, David Race Bannon, Ph.D., holds a doctorate degree in history, a master's degree in computer science, and high black belts in several martial arts, fluent in Korean and Japanese.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:56.602]  He has published several articles and books on history, martial arts, and computers.
[01:09:56.962 --> 01:09:59.723]  Bannon has appeared on the Discovery Channel, A&E, and History Channel.
[01:10:00.123 --> 01:10:01.884]  He left Interpol to become an educator.
[01:10:02.344 --> 01:10:04.625]  And Dr. Bannon, good to have you on the show.
[01:10:04.645 --> 01:10:07.106]  Appreciate you joining us.
[01:10:08.146 --> 01:10:12.329]  I should say this, the blurb on the book, on the inside jacket, I didn't write it.
[01:10:14.071 --> 01:10:15.932]  There's a marketing professional who put that together.
[01:10:15.952 --> 01:10:17.853]  Yeah, it kind of sounds like that, doesn't it?
[01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:18.254]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:19.275 --> 01:10:22.757]  In this stunning expose, the shocking truth revealed.
[01:10:22.977 --> 01:10:23.538]  Exactly.
[01:10:24.198 --> 01:10:30.523]  But, you know, I have trouble, I scan news wires every day, and you win.
[01:10:32.159 --> 01:10:34.560]  Oh sure, and I wouldn't say Interpol was the good guy, far from it.
[01:10:56.731 --> 01:11:06.358]  Certainly the sub-directorate of Interpol for which I worked, Archangel, our job was to identify those who buy and sell children across international lines.
[01:11:08.099 --> 01:11:18.446]  Having said that, you've mentioned previously a couple of times, very good point, for most listeners it's difficult to wrap our brains around this type of crime.
[01:11:19.787 --> 01:11:21.248]  Just so that people are aware,
[01:11:21.707 --> 01:11:23.729]  I'm going to be tossing out some statistics.
[01:11:23.989 --> 01:11:32.455]  They can go to my website, DavidBannon.net, and get all of the information in our press library that I'll be quoting.
[01:11:32.495 --> 01:11:35.798]  They'll be able to read the various reports from universities, etc.
[01:11:37.379 --> 01:11:46.506]  Here in the United States, some 269,000 children were smuggled into the United States for the sex trade just last year.
[01:11:48.243 --> 01:12:00.910]  10% of the missing children in the United States are sold overseas at about $30,000 apiece to brothels throughout the Middle East, Thailand, and many other countries that we'll talk about as we go on.
[01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:03.372]  This is a global problem.
[01:12:03.532 --> 01:12:04.812]  It cannot be ignored.
[01:12:04.852 --> 01:12:06.974]  These children are as young as 18 months.
[01:12:07.534 --> 01:12:11.837]  In just March of this year, 28 baby girls, all under 3 months.
[01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:18.353]  We're being smuggled out of China for the worldwide human traffic trade.
[01:12:19.033 --> 01:12:23.716]  This problem is so huge and yet it very seldom gets the media attention it deserves.
[01:12:24.276 --> 01:12:27.138]  Perhaps because the sheer horror of this atrocity.
[01:12:27.967 --> 01:12:31.708]  Not only terrifies us, but generates such disbelief.
[01:12:31.728 --> 01:12:40.750]  Well, Dr. Bannon, also the establishments involved in this, they use it for blackmail and they use it, it's a massive money laundering operation.
[01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:52.032]  I mean, did you hear about DynCorp, actually got caught in court and civilly convicted and had to admit it, that they were involved in a 200,000 kidnapped women and children transporting them out of the Balkans?
[01:12:52.572 --> 01:12:52.752]  Right.
[01:12:53.372 --> 01:12:57.514]  I mean, that's $200,000 and it's in the back of Reuters a couple times.
[01:12:57.774 --> 01:12:57.994]  Why?
[01:12:58.054 --> 01:13:00.995]  I mean, you know, this is horrible.
[01:13:01.075 --> 01:13:15.001]  So what I'm saying is, every time I track it back, it's the U.N., it's major corporations, and then there are federal agencies and other agencies that are trying to stop it, but they always get hauled off of it when they get too high up the chain.
[01:13:15.601 --> 01:13:16.761]  Exactly correct.
[01:13:17.102 --> 01:13:18.082]  My years with Interpol,
[01:13:18.992 --> 01:13:37.688]  When we were assigned to track these individuals, many times we would find within a network of these slavery rings, there were individuals highly placed, either religious or political leaders or people of old money, and very seldom were those individuals our targets.
[01:13:37.808 --> 01:13:40.210]  Instead, we would target people lower down the chain.
[01:13:42.453 --> 01:13:52.436]  And then it really becomes an overarching system, an intelligence system, so the elite knows how close other agencies are getting to what they're doing.
[01:13:53.237 --> 01:13:53.937]  That is correct.
[01:13:54.277 --> 01:14:03.840]  And I do believe that there are a lot of people in Interpol who wanted this terrible traffic to stop and were doing everything they could to stop it.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.401]  But I also know that frequently
[01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:22.133]  Uh, we were not assigned the cases where it was very clear an individual of significant influence was either buying and selling child pornography or actually involved in purchasing the services of child prostitutes.
[01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:24.434]  Unbelievable.
[01:14:24.914 --> 01:14:27.334]  Now, you would assassinate these people?
[01:14:28.735 --> 01:14:33.796]  The teams with Archangel, known as Cleaners, were, in essence, assassination teams, yes.
[01:14:36.008 --> 01:14:40.512]  And I guess we'll talk about that when we get back, but how did you get into this?
[01:14:40.552 --> 01:14:42.073]  That's really, I guess, where the story should start.
[01:14:43.074 --> 01:14:43.454]  Oh, sure.
[01:14:43.494 --> 01:14:45.156]  Do we want to talk about that when we get back?
[01:14:45.796 --> 01:14:46.897]  Well, we've got a few minutes right now.
[01:14:46.937 --> 01:14:48.298]  I just wanted to warn you of that.
[01:14:48.338 --> 01:14:49.559]  But yeah, how did this start?
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:57.646]  Well, I started as a Mormon missionary in South Korea, of all things, and got involved in a riot in South Korea.
[01:14:57.666 --> 01:14:59.667]  At the time, it was a very war-torn country.
[01:14:59.908 --> 01:15:06.353]  Some 2,500 students were killed during that riot, and I was required to use lethal force to defend myself.
[01:15:07.033 --> 01:15:14.960]  My actions came to the attention of an Interpol recruiter, and it was just convenient for him to have somebody who had Korean language training.
[01:15:15.499 --> 01:15:15.860]  And that's
[01:15:35.106 --> 01:15:43.632]  The reason being that if you have someone young and naive who will equate service to God with service to country, you can get them to do anything.
[01:15:44.492 --> 01:15:50.416]  And they're intelligent, but they compartmentalize that and are very blind to corruption around them.
[01:15:50.496 --> 01:15:52.117]  Oh, the end justifies the means.
[01:15:52.618 --> 01:15:54.079]  Yes, frequently so.
[01:15:54.219 --> 01:15:58.782]  And the training that we were given was very arduous, daily hours of it.
[01:15:59.266 --> 01:16:05.927]  Teaching us, essentially, that these people who traffic in children are evil and that we were unique in the world.
[01:16:06.007 --> 01:16:09.748]  The only ones who could eliminate or eradicate these individuals.
[01:16:10.248 --> 01:16:13.869]  I'm not saying that the crime is not evil in itself.
[01:16:14.389 --> 01:16:18.150]  What I'm saying is that the training convinced us of such.
[01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:23.631]  Well, it certainly is evil, but then out of this they create a cadre that will kill on command.
[01:16:23.651 --> 01:16:27.212]  And the point is, these scum should be brought to justice and publicly executed.
[01:16:29.715 --> 01:16:36.820]  And again, the over-reaching system of government control is to actually control this industry.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.622]  And just like the drug trade, they go after the small-time dealer, not the cartels.
[01:16:40.922 --> 01:16:41.643]  Be right back, Doctor.
[01:16:43.041 --> 01:16:46.944]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:16:47.164 --> 01:16:52.609]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.

[01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:07.761]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:17:07.941 --> 01:17:16.305]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:17:16.585 --> 01:17:22.947]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:51.643]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:18:52.103 --> 01:18:53.163]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:18:53.223 --> 01:18:57.205]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:18:57.905 --> 01:19:11.215]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.

[01:20:39.441 --> 01:20:44.285]  He rode a blazing saddle.
[01:20:44.405 --> 01:20:46.566]  He wore a shining star.
[01:20:46.626 --> 01:20:49.688]  His job to offer battle.
[01:21:01.676 --> 01:21:20.110]  Alright folks, Dr. David Bannon, Ph.D., is our guest, and he was a Mormon missionary in South Korea, and got recruited, and the information he's bringing up here, I mean, I know it all to be accurate, because we've studied this here on the show, among many other corrupt things the Globalist are up to.
[01:21:21.098 --> 01:21:35.186]  And so they're told that you're this elite cadre, you're going to go out and you're going to kill these traffickers, which I certainly can't disagree with, but then you've got the government building this secret group of assassins, and then it's the government itself involved in all of it at a higher level.
[01:21:35.907 --> 01:21:41.510]  Dr. Bannon, continuing, you get recruited into this, this subgroup of Interpol, please continue.
[01:21:42.918 --> 01:21:54.286]  The subdirector within Interpol was known as Archangel and essentially Archangel was assigned to identify what are known as producers of child pornography and I'll tell you the difference.
[01:21:54.426 --> 01:21:58.729]  The consumer trader is the individual that might be a fourth grade teacher that we've heard about.
[01:21:59.469 --> 01:22:02.932]  He's buying and selling kiddie porn and abusing local children.
[01:22:03.012 --> 01:22:06.694]  As horrible as that is, the producers are even worse.
[01:22:06.794 --> 01:22:12.258]  They're the ones who buy and sell children across international lines as young as three months old
[01:22:12.967 --> 01:22:16.069]  Abuse and torture these children and sell the resulting images.
[01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:33.537]  The technical arm of Interpol called Rosetta would identify these producers and produce photographic or eyewitness accounts that these producers were with child, which is a euphemism meaning that there was indeed proof that they were abusing and molesting and buying and selling these children.
[01:22:34.318 --> 01:22:42.542]  We were then given a dossier on this individual and assigned either as a team or singly to track this individual and
[01:22:43.197 --> 01:22:44.778]  How many people did you torture and kill, Doctor?
[01:22:56.701 --> 01:22:59.684]  If I may dodge that question, I will answer this.
[01:22:59.884 --> 01:23:13.535]  The head of Archangel, Commissioner Jacques Deferre, with Interpol, told me that of the some 250 Archangel cleaners, or assassins, most of them were responsible for into three digits.
[01:23:15.416 --> 01:23:16.257]  Three digits?
[01:23:16.497 --> 01:23:16.898]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:19.179 --> 01:23:23.443]  But that's, that, that, I mean, but you look at the BBC and Reuters, I mean,
[01:23:24.176 --> 01:23:28.399]  Don Corr and the UN, 200,000 people flown out, women and children.
[01:23:28.439 --> 01:23:30.300]  I mean, how big is this?
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.701]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:23:32.602 --> 01:23:36.084]  It is of huge global proportions.
[01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:40.187]  The money that is generated is into the billions of dollars.
[01:23:40.706 --> 01:23:57.156]  Terrorist cells use child pornography to fund their activities because the money is easy to come by and it is so... Now, were you aware of the finders case in the 80s in DC where they go into the warehouse and the CIA runs it and it's full of all this stuff and the police get called off the case?
[01:23:58.017 --> 01:23:58.957]  I heard about it.
[01:23:59.037 --> 01:24:00.418]  I was not involved in it, however.
[01:24:01.439 --> 01:24:04.541]  So, I mean, I'm trying to get back to this because this is...
[01:24:05.444 --> 01:24:11.708]  From your years in this fighting, as you said, a lot of it was low-level people that you were eliminating.
[01:24:12.349 --> 01:24:13.149]  Nice word for it.
[01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:17.172]  But then you talked about the connections higher up.
[01:24:18.073 --> 01:24:20.114]  I mean, what really runs this?
[01:24:20.414 --> 01:24:21.575]  What does it lead back to?
[01:24:22.696 --> 01:24:27.860]  Well, ultimately it comes down to money, as almost all of these pernicious rings do.
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.242]  The producers themselves had to have customers.
[01:24:32.346 --> 01:24:45.395]  When we were able to extract information from the producers frequently they would name more powerful people who were funding their activities and who were purchasing much of the material as well as purchasing the children themselves.
[01:24:46.256 --> 01:24:56.823]  Some of the names that we were given we would deliver to our commissioner and never hear again and they were names of people that are infamous in the world for their
[01:24:57.978 --> 01:25:01.680]  Either political, monetary, or religious influence.
[01:25:03.721 --> 01:25:09.603]  Wow, yeah, that's just incredible to see this going on.
[01:25:11.504 --> 01:25:15.866]  What happened on the first assassination mission you went on?
[01:25:17.667 --> 01:25:25.551]  At the time, Romania was communist, and I was assigned to track an individual who had kidnapped a six-year-old boy from a London orphanage.
[01:25:26.255 --> 01:25:33.477]  And after a short stop in France, he had taken the child to communist Romania where child prostitution was legal.
[01:25:34.477 --> 01:25:44.980]  He was then selling the child in prostitution, recording images and selling those, and had made a deal to sell the child to a brothel for the rest of the child's life in Thailand.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.721]  So this communist state was all for this?
[01:25:48.702 --> 01:25:49.662]  Remarkably so.
[01:25:50.885 --> 01:25:56.947]  The Communist Romania at the time, it was against the law to have abortions.
[01:25:57.147 --> 01:26:00.208]  Everyone was encouraged to have six children.
[01:26:01.309 --> 01:26:06.410]  And the idea being that the more they increased their workforce, the more they would be an influence in the world.
[01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:11.632]  What ultimately happened, of course, is there were too many children, and when everyone is desperately poor,
[01:26:12.153 --> 01:26:13.234]  And there's too many children.
[01:26:13.274 --> 01:26:14.815]  There are those who will take advantage.
[01:26:14.835 --> 01:26:21.440]  Yeah, that was a BBC News article, and this is admitted, it's not a conspiracy theory, where they addict the kids to opium to make them work.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:22.541]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:26:22.821 --> 01:26:23.121]  Oh, yes.
[01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:24.662]  And they went in and shot them vinegar.
[01:26:24.702 --> 01:26:30.207]  It's not even hidden, so... I mean, it's just the world is so evil, and we're so naive here in America.
[01:26:30.587 --> 01:26:31.207]  Stay there, Doctor.
[01:26:33.089 --> 01:26:33.989]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:36.091]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.012 --> 01:26:39.674]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.491 --> 01:26:52.454]  Offered for the first time on GCN, the Capitol Hill Directory, Congress at your fingertips, gives you all the pertinent information for every member of the House and Senate for the 108th Congress.
[01:26:52.494 --> 01:26:53.614]  This includes websites for...
[01:27:08.855 --> 01:27:14.057]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:16.597 --> 01:27:18.838]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:27:20.038 --> 01:27:29.961]  We're live, going on worldwide, on the AM and FM dials, simulcasting on the internet, at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and the global shortwave.
[01:27:32.002 --> 01:27:33.903]  During the day at 12.172 and 93.20, at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90,
[01:27:39.966 --> 01:27:52.228]  Dr. David Bannon, when he was 19, was a missionary, a Christian missionary over in South Korea and got recruited in to a sub-directorate of Interpol called Archangel.
[01:27:52.928 --> 01:27:59.750]  And they would go around killing the, I guess, lower-mid-level scumbags or literal demons.
[01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:07.051]  And we're also going to go to some of your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:28:07.191 --> 01:28:07.871]  I don't know where to
[01:28:08.479 --> 01:28:09.240]  You know, where to go with this?
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.121]  I've got so many questions, Dr. Bannon.
[01:28:13.343 --> 01:28:20.269]  You'd go out and assassinate these people, and then later you discovered that people higher up weren't being gone after?
[01:28:20.309 --> 01:28:21.450]  Can you break that down for us?
[01:28:22.211 --> 01:28:22.711]  Oh, sure.
[01:28:23.212 --> 01:28:33.120]  I had mentioned earlier that the technical arm of the sub-directorate within Interpol, known as Rosetta, would identify these producers and hand us dossiers.
[01:28:33.743 --> 01:28:39.686]  We then were encouraged to infiltrate the network just basically doing standard undercover work.
[01:28:39.726 --> 01:28:50.912]  We would develop a complete legend or cover story and get as much information as possible before we ultimately eliminated our target, sometimes using torture if necessary.
[01:28:52.036 --> 01:29:15.146]  While we were doing this, we often would uncover many names within the network that were not known to us, just low-level producers again all across the world, and occasionally a name would pop up that was immediately recognizable, or upon further research we could see was highly placed within a government, within a religious organization, or some major global corporation.
[01:29:15.166 --> 01:29:16.706]  Were you allowed to go after those people?
[01:29:17.127 --> 01:29:17.667]  Not once.
[01:29:20.692 --> 01:29:21.392]  That's amazing.
[01:29:21.432 --> 01:29:27.896]  So in a way, again, it was an intelligence bureau for those in the establishment that were doing this to insulate themselves.
[01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:48.507]  And just talking around the warehouse where we trained at Archangel, talking with some of our supervisors, etc., we do know that there were occasionally times when these individuals were blackmailed with the information that we had uncovered to suit the current agenda of Interpol.
[01:29:49.588 --> 01:29:49.828]  Now,
[01:29:51.434 --> 01:29:58.319]  Just an average, you know, committing hundreds of assassinations, on average assassination, how would that play out?
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:04.804]  Well, each assassination team, a team of cleaners, usually was three or four individuals.
[01:30:04.864 --> 01:30:07.486]  Sometimes we were sent out singly or in teams.
[01:30:08.227 --> 01:30:11.490]  The teams had their own strengths and weaknesses.
[01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:15.773]  My particular forte was what's known as close wet work, that is,
[01:30:16.249 --> 01:30:20.432]  Close quarter combat using hands or bladed weapons, quiet kills.
[01:30:20.572 --> 01:30:23.753]  So walking up and stabbing somebody in the neck or head?
[01:30:24.114 --> 01:30:25.214]  Yes.
[01:30:25.655 --> 01:30:27.296]  Basic special forces type stuff?
[01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:28.957]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[01:30:29.537 --> 01:30:35.200]  And the methods that we used were designed to eliminate the person quickly and quietly.
[01:30:35.861 --> 01:30:38.462]  There were other methods used of course.
[01:30:38.502 --> 01:30:41.164]  Poisoning, shootings.
[01:30:42.124 --> 01:30:44.926]  Ever sabotage vehicles or was that not sure enough?
[01:30:45.778 --> 01:30:54.001]  That is definitely not sure enough, and again we frequently wanted to isolate the individual so that we could extract as much information as possible.
[01:30:54.901 --> 01:31:04.404]  So basically you'd be waiting in their apartment or house at night, have somebody in a car surveilling if they were alone, and then have somebody block the hallway once they go in the room and then torture them there?
[01:31:04.965 --> 01:31:06.285]  Frequently that happened.
[01:31:06.385 --> 01:31:09.706]  What happens with many of these producers is they are collectors.
[01:31:09.906 --> 01:31:14.988]  They keep a huge number, sometimes tens of thousands of images of child pornography
[01:31:15.615 --> 01:31:19.478]  In a secret location in their home, either in the basement or in a secret room.
[01:31:19.839 --> 01:31:22.461]  It's very common among this type of individual.
[01:31:23.322 --> 01:31:34.511]  We were able to then use that room where they kept their secret stash and where they frequently molested children to return the favor and torture them for information.
[01:31:36.092 --> 01:31:37.874]  So you would use that secure location.
[01:31:38.454 --> 01:31:43.058]  There was a story out of Belgium and that was on the BBC television.
[01:31:43.358 --> 01:31:43.899]  I saw it.
[01:31:44.637 --> 01:31:45.338]  Mark Petro.
[01:31:46.538 --> 01:31:55.204]  Yeah, and hundreds of thousands protested and demonstrated because they found the dead kids in his torture chamber, and it led back to government officials, so they kind of killed the investigation.
[01:31:55.224 --> 01:31:56.484]  Can you speak to that case?
[01:31:56.965 --> 01:31:57.525]  Absolutely.
[01:31:57.685 --> 01:31:59.346]  As a matter of fact, I was involved.
[01:31:59.726 --> 01:32:07.671]  He was known as the Belgian Beast, and of the many, many children that he abused and individuals that he killed,
[01:32:08.934 --> 01:32:20.064]  The most notorious, perhaps one that got most press, were the two eight-year-old girls that were kept in his locked room in the basement for three weeks until they ultimately were starved to death.
[01:32:22.386 --> 01:32:30.073]  Belgian Beast is the appropriate term, and when he was arrested and then released, then arrested again, all of this came to international attention.
[01:32:30.434 --> 01:32:35.178]  But what many of the listeners may not be aware of is that there was a vast network connected to
[01:32:35.862 --> 01:32:43.406]  Detro that he was able to sell these images through and that's where the funding came, especially for his defense fund.
[01:32:44.266 --> 01:32:48.128]  Senator John DeCamp, are you familiar with the Franklin cover-up story?
[01:32:49.068 --> 01:32:49.708]  Please explain.
[01:32:50.749 --> 01:33:01.234]  Well, they had gone to the savings and loan in Lincoln, Nebraska and found a bunch of this stuff with the top Republican Party people in the state.
[01:33:02.788 --> 01:33:06.832]  And he, you know, was one of the former top people on the state senate.
[01:33:07.492 --> 01:33:09.154]  He was actually hired to disprove all this.
[01:33:09.194 --> 01:33:10.155]  He found it was true.
[01:33:10.175 --> 01:33:12.777]  A bunch of his private investigators got assassinated.
[01:33:12.797 --> 01:33:14.218]  Their planes blew up, stuff like that.
[01:33:14.658 --> 01:33:16.740]  He got diaries, all this stuff, police reports.
[01:33:17.241 --> 01:33:23.746]  It led back to a place called, well, a place where they have a big stone owl and do rituals in northern California, what the children described.
[01:33:24.086 --> 01:33:29.231]  Then the police swooped in, the FBI swooped in, their national security grabbed all the stuff, but he did confirm that.
[01:33:30.072 --> 01:33:40.095]  And it was this giant network, and it just, again, whether it's Belgium, or Norway, or France, or England, or Germany, it always leads back.
[01:33:40.135 --> 01:33:47.696]  There was a story in Reuters a couple weeks ago about this big top German judge who had the slave pens with kids.
[01:33:47.896 --> 01:33:48.617]  She got caught.
[01:33:48.997 --> 01:33:49.917]  They were killing kids.
[01:33:50.457 --> 01:33:50.657]  Right.
[01:33:50.717 --> 01:33:52.398]  I mean, what is going on?
[01:33:52.438 --> 01:33:54.098]  Do these people run things or something?
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:59.965]  Well, that's an excellent question, and one that I frequently wrestled with.
[01:34:00.546 --> 01:34:06.472]  We found that the global traffic was so huge, and no matter how much we tried to combat it, there was always more.
[01:34:07.173 --> 01:34:14.560]  And once you have people with influence and money involved in a particular traffic, they're going to protect their interests.
[01:34:15.001 --> 01:34:18.064]  What we found with the Belgian Beast case is that
[01:34:18.806 --> 01:34:26.354]  Of the very large network, only 14 of the other members of the network were targeted by Archangel for elimination.
[01:34:27.035 --> 01:34:29.457]  All of the others in this vast network were left alone.
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:32.761]  Well, that's incredible.
[01:34:34.122 --> 01:34:34.643]  Unbelievable.
[01:34:35.103 --> 01:34:39.888]  Dr. Ray Spannin again, for those just tuned in, just recap about yourself and
[01:34:41.081 --> 01:34:57.943]  Your experience inside because I mean look I would have no problem myself as a Christian myself I can imagine you know being 19 in college then recruited to go out to see the evidence to kill these people I mean that is totally wholesome and good to to to to execute trash
[01:34:58.735 --> 01:35:04.900]  The problem is, is that then you get into the government creating this precedent to use it against people who aren't guilty.
[01:35:05.401 --> 01:35:08.603]  And obviously, if they would have brought this out in the open, they could have been tried.
[01:35:08.983 --> 01:35:11.906]  A jury of their peers would have given them the death penalty.
[01:35:11.946 --> 01:35:15.589]  But again, you have people high up in society who wouldn't have allowed that to happen.
[01:35:15.869 --> 01:35:21.694]  And then here you are, time and time again, finding out this is being used to blackmail public officials and being used at higher levels.
[01:35:22.134 --> 01:35:28.039]  So really just being a backdoor intelligence community to have a grasp on what was going on in their own industry.
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:30.741]  How many years did this go on?
[01:35:30.781 --> 01:35:33.603]  How long were you involved in this, in killing these demons?
[01:35:34.084 --> 01:35:40.429]  And then, how did you wrestle with the torture part, though, to extract the information?
[01:35:40.949 --> 01:35:44.472]  And then, why did you finally get out, and what happened when you tried to get out?
[01:35:46.313 --> 01:35:47.935]  Well, that's a whole long question.
[01:35:48.475 --> 01:35:50.837]  First, the number of years, about 18 years.
[01:35:50.897 --> 01:35:52.038]  My last assignment was in 1999.
[01:35:54.123 --> 01:36:03.412]  My primary work, where it was just day in and day out, every day working for Archangel, was about four years, however, in the 1980s.
[01:36:04.052 --> 01:36:10.398]  After that, I was just used on occasional assignments because so many of the cleaners suffered from burnout, and certainly I did.
[01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:19.166]  The dull, throbbing horror of taking another person's life and of using
[01:36:19.707 --> 01:36:19.887]  I think?
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:50.787]  Seeing those images, it was not too difficult then to use the methods in which I was trained to extract the information.
[01:36:50.807 --> 01:36:53.149]  Yeah, you're literally just sending a demon back to hell.
[01:36:54.110 --> 01:37:03.638]  Certainly, I think it is arguable, and I felt very strongly at the time, that of all human evils, the abuse of very young children must be on the top of the list.
[01:37:03.658 --> 01:37:09.302]  Well, Joseph Mengele did it in Germany, and then was wrought and protected by the CIA.
[01:37:11.333 --> 01:37:12.894]  That's admitted History Channel stuff.
[01:37:13.014 --> 01:37:30.240]  We have the government doing hundreds of thousands of young girls in eugenics programs being sterilized, being practiced on by medical experiments, by doctors, the retarded children being radiated, the parents being told it was a treatment, they radiate and they die hours later.
[01:37:34.165 --> 01:37:35.645]  Again, there's just so much of this.
[01:37:35.966 --> 01:37:41.669]  It's almost institutionalized in some of the other forms that aren't sexual.
[01:37:42.349 --> 01:37:45.531]  Just using children coldly as medical experiments.
[01:37:48.312 --> 01:37:49.393]  I don't understand.
[01:37:50.033 --> 01:37:53.475]  Again, I can't even begin to understand how this even happens.
[01:37:53.495 --> 01:37:59.518]  It goes so counter to my programming that I don't even... I mean, I see the reports.
[01:37:59.578 --> 01:38:00.539]  I know what's going on.
[01:38:00.559 --> 01:38:02.300]  I don't know.
[01:38:02.859 --> 01:38:11.021]  And that's the nature of atrocity, Alex, is that it is so grotesque and so huge, it's difficult for us to wrap our brains around it.
[01:38:11.221 --> 01:38:15.482]  Stalin said, when one person dies, it's a tragedy, but when 10,000 die, it's a statistic.
[01:38:16.082 --> 01:38:16.883]  Oh, exactly.
[01:38:17.103 --> 01:38:24.645]  And I think if someone had not grown up in history class and had never heard of the Holocaust, to be told those numbers,
[01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:27.071]  They wouldn't believe it.
[01:38:27.171 --> 01:38:28.052]  They would resist.
[01:38:28.072 --> 01:38:30.034]  Or that Stalin killed 50 million people.
[01:38:30.354 --> 01:38:30.594]  Right.
[01:38:30.754 --> 01:38:31.795]  They would resist that.
[01:38:32.436 --> 01:38:35.899]  And it's exactly what happens with the child sex trade.
[01:38:36.499 --> 01:38:39.642]  Even in Thailand right now, you spoke of institutionalization.
[01:38:40.163 --> 01:38:48.650]  In Thailand, it's institutionalized and legal so that anyone can go on the internet and sign up for a child sex tour in that country.
[01:38:49.671 --> 01:38:51.072]  I have to ask this question.
[01:38:51.332 --> 01:38:52.493]  If they're looking for a war,
[01:38:53.724 --> 01:38:56.466]  Uh, and they need an idea for a war this week.
[01:38:56.986 --> 01:39:00.268]  Perhaps protecting innocent children might come on top of the list.
[01:39:00.288 --> 01:39:01.069]  You know, I agree.
[01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:05.172]  I mean, look, I... Kim Jong-il lives in a seven-story pleasure palace.
[01:39:05.848 --> 01:39:13.272]  He has kidnapped, you know, whole jets full of women and had them take it to his country and then apologized to Japan.
[01:39:13.312 --> 01:39:16.094]  I'm sorry I killed the people I kidnapped.
[01:39:16.114 --> 01:39:17.795]  That was just a few months ago in Time Magazine.
[01:39:18.035 --> 01:39:18.235]  Right.
[01:39:18.936 --> 01:39:21.057]  You know, sure, nuke him, okay?
[01:39:21.337 --> 01:39:23.678]  But the point is they're just going to put some other dictatorship in there.
[01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:25.359]  But yeah, Thailand.
[01:39:25.479 --> 01:39:27.641]  I mean, this is a pit of evil.
[01:39:29.742 --> 01:39:31.123]  What about Saudi Arabia?
[01:39:31.623 --> 01:39:31.963]  Oh, right.
[01:39:32.143 --> 01:39:32.343]  Right.
[01:39:33.024 --> 01:39:34.865]  I mean, there was an article where they
[01:39:36.281 --> 01:39:39.422]  You know, where the jets land just full of this stuff.
[01:39:42.123 --> 01:39:48.645]  And there are many other countries where it's either legal or half legal or illegal, but it's a wink and a nod.
[01:39:49.065 --> 01:39:51.346]  China, it's certainly a wink and a nod.
[01:39:51.966 --> 01:40:02.189]  In Japan, it's legal to own reproductions and all of this child pornography, but in theory, illegal to purchase a child prostitute, although in Tokyo's
[01:40:02.625 --> 01:40:03.766]  Well, it's just across the board.
[01:40:03.806 --> 01:40:05.966]  There's all these massive evils and you've got naive Americans.
[01:40:05.986 --> 01:40:08.788]  I mean, that's why this system gets away with all this, because
[01:40:30.515 --> 01:40:31.695]  People are so naive.
[01:40:31.735 --> 01:40:41.259]  We're living in our own little world with our green yards and our, you know, SUVs and season tickets.
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:47.862]  And I don't want to believe this, but just scanning news wires every day, I just run into it in my house.
[01:40:47.902 --> 01:40:48.442]  It's everywhere.
[01:40:48.742 --> 01:40:49.902]  Sure, it's everywhere.
[01:40:50.082 --> 01:40:59.186]  And as you mentioned, this naive tendency to disbelieve is in a small way responsible for the perpetuation of this atrocity.
[01:40:59.631 --> 01:41:04.456]  And until we, as citizens of the world, band together to stop it, it will continue.
[01:41:05.818 --> 01:41:19.612]  But then we see it being misdirected many times by the perpetrators in government, where then a family just takes a picture of their 8-month-old baby playing in the
[01:41:20.771 --> 01:41:24.712]  Well, I think that there's a mania that's caused and it's easier to feed that mania
[01:41:43.904 --> 01:41:51.467]  And therefore satisfy individuals and satisfy the public outcry without actually doing anything.
[01:41:52.007 --> 01:41:56.608]  So it's another sub-level of what you were doing, killing low-level people instead of high-level people.
[01:41:57.148 --> 01:41:58.289]  Right, right.
[01:41:58.929 --> 01:42:03.670]  And the problem is so much more huge than that and so grotesque.
[01:42:05.431 --> 01:42:12.033]  People who read my book probably will find it, although very interesting and a necessary book,
[01:42:12.623 --> 01:42:26.706]  Also very disturbing because the reality of how individuals torture children as young as 18 months and buy and sell them to others for the same sexual purposes is so grotesque.
[01:42:27.806 --> 01:42:30.927]  And the fact that it has not come out as much as it should.
[01:42:30.947 --> 01:42:32.887]  It's just the occasional news wire.
[01:42:32.967 --> 01:42:38.449]  There was a big report in Italy about stuff in Russia abusing and killing male toddlers.
[01:42:38.969 --> 01:42:39.169]  Right.
[01:42:40.369 --> 01:42:47.051]  And then it led back to a Hollywood group and the story got killed and the Italian news producers that did the story got fired.
[01:42:47.551 --> 01:42:47.731]  Right.
[01:42:47.991 --> 01:42:49.111]  Did you hear about that last year?
[01:42:49.952 --> 01:42:53.373]  I remember reading it in a sum-up in a magazine, yes.
[01:42:57.182 --> 01:42:57.562]  I don't know.
[01:42:57.702 --> 01:43:05.125]  I just wish there was a new world to go to, you know, like they did in 1776 or 1650s or whatever.
[01:43:05.145 --> 01:43:08.687]  I mean, I wish we could just get away from it, but you can't.
[01:43:09.007 --> 01:43:09.867]  How do you deal with it?
[01:43:11.688 --> 01:43:25.133]  And the archangel answer, and I'm not saying this is the correct answer, because the reason I wrote the book was to increase awareness of this problem and also to let people know of the activities of organizations like Interpol.
[01:43:25.931 --> 01:43:30.732]  Interpol is the world's second largest international organization, right next to the UN.
[01:43:30.832 --> 01:43:32.632]  It has 180 plus member countries.
[01:43:32.952 --> 01:43:33.812]  You never hear about it.
[01:43:34.232 --> 01:43:39.613]  Right, and you never hear about it, which is a testament to their effectiveness as an intelligence agency.
[01:43:39.893 --> 01:43:41.594]  Are they mad at you for reporting on this?
[01:43:41.774 --> 01:43:43.314]  They are furious.
[01:43:45.254 --> 01:43:54.976]  Just over the last two months, culminating on May the 10th, there has been a lot of tension between Interpol officers sent to
[01:43:55.831 --> 01:44:02.799]  Encourage an affidavit from me that essentially, if I sign this affidavit, it would say that everything in the book is false.
[01:44:03.639 --> 01:44:06.603]  And then they would use that affidavit to stop the publication of the book.
[01:44:07.584 --> 01:44:13.270]  A number of warring factions within Interpol and without came to my aid.
[01:44:13.889 --> 01:44:26.723]  And ultimately, my supervisor would... You know, that's the secret here, is good men and women standing up in government, saying no to all the corruption, all the different facets of it, and the facet you're involved in, and saying no to this.
[01:44:26.763 --> 01:44:30.627]  We're not going along with it and we're not gonna, you know, carry this out anymore.
[01:44:30.947 --> 01:44:31.167]  Right.
[01:44:31.348 --> 01:44:35.372]  And from surprising locations, the Vice President of Interpol in Asia
[01:44:36.171 --> 01:44:42.396]  came to my aid, emphatically condemning that they were trying to stop the publication of this book.
[01:44:42.556 --> 01:44:43.577]  Alright, now I interrupted you.
[01:44:43.597 --> 01:44:46.579]  I wanted to talk about what the solutions are, and you were saying what Archangel's solution was.
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:47.540]  We'll talk about that.
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.682]  We'll take a few calls when we get back with Dr. Ray Spannin.
[01:44:50.903 --> 01:44:51.884]  Ray Spannin, of course.
[01:44:51.944 --> 01:44:52.444]  Johnny Quest.
[01:44:52.464 --> 01:44:55.006]  That's an interesting name, Dr. David Ray Spannin.
[01:44:55.887 --> 01:44:57.848]  We've even got some Johnny Quest bumper music here.
[01:44:58.609 --> 01:44:59.630]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:44:59.650 --> 01:45:01.091]  This is really horrible stuff.
[01:45:04.179 --> 01:45:07.760]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.420]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:11.341]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:45:11.601 --> 01:45:16.782]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:45:17.142 --> 01:45:21.623]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:45:21.943 --> 01:45:30.565]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:45:31.085 --> 01:45:32.206]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:45:32.706 --> 01:45:36.469]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:45:36.749 --> 01:45:43.374]  With a regular program of oral hygiene, including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:45:43.714 --> 01:45:47.917]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[01:46:03.388 --> 01:46:07.111]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:46:07.131 --> 01:46:10.654]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:46:10.715 --> 01:46:14.718]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:46:14.858 --> 01:46:21.084]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:21.444 --> 01:46:29.371]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:46:29.531 --> 01:46:35.214]  Black Murky filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:46:35.274 --> 01:46:39.116]  Yet the Black Murky filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:46:39.416 --> 01:46:41.277]  And the Black Murky filters are recleanable.
[01:46:41.337 --> 01:46:43.479]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:46:43.719 --> 01:46:48.061]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:46:48.101 --> 01:46:52.824]  Get the powerful Black Murky replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-699-7000.
[01:46:53.524 --> 01:46:57.167]  803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:46:57.428 --> 01:47:01.491]  That's 808-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:47:02.132 --> 01:47:06.476]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:06.656 --> 01:47:11.080]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:15.624]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:47:15.664 --> 01:47:16.986]  The New World Order.
[01:47:17.742 --> 01:47:18.703]  Panama.
[01:47:18.763 --> 01:47:22.984]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:47:23.044 --> 01:47:29.988]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:47:30.108 --> 01:47:32.189]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:32.489 --> 01:47:41.613]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery
[01:47:43.114 --> 01:47:48.498]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new 2.5 hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!
[01:47:48.999 --> 01:47:52.902]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:47:53.462 --> 01:47:55.203]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:48:07.778 --> 01:48:12.721]  It's horrible, it's upsetting, it's depressing.
[01:48:13.181 --> 01:48:16.283]  But as Patrick Henry said, if we don't face the truth, we'll be destroyed.
[01:48:17.464 --> 01:48:22.428]  And folks, on InfoWars.com, on PrisonPlanet.com, I got AP, Reuters, BBC, UPI.
[01:48:22.488 --> 01:48:27.271]  With DynCorp and the UN, 200,000 women and children in one year alone.
[01:48:31.354 --> 01:48:36.597]  They always catch UN heads and people in New York with their own sex slaves in back rooms.
[01:48:36.617 --> 01:48:38.018]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[01:48:38.639 --> 01:48:40.120]  Houston had a big bust.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.781]  The good cops got involved and busted it.
[01:48:41.801 --> 01:48:47.965]  A lot of times the low-level folks bust something they weren't supposed to with a bunch of Mexican sex slaves, women and children.
[01:48:48.765 --> 01:48:53.028]  And yeah, when you've got the evidence of this, show it to a jury, give them all the death penalty.
[01:48:53.815 --> 01:48:53.915]  Yeah.
[01:49:10.075 --> 01:49:12.499]  Uh, and then it allows the secrecy to go on.
[01:49:12.519 --> 01:49:15.303]  Uh, and I was just talking to Dr. Bannon.
[01:49:15.343 --> 01:49:20.430]  He was saying that it did look like that the higher reps at Interpol were there to cover this up.
[01:49:20.450 --> 01:49:23.173]  Do you, uh, would you like to elaborate on that, doctor?
[01:49:23.214 --> 01:49:23.995]  Then we'll go to some calls.
[01:49:24.762 --> 01:49:48.239]  Oh, well, I just got the impression over a number of years that Archangel's solution of eliminating these producers who were skating around international laws and using their power brokers of influence to escape prosecution, those targets could be identified, but anyone higher up, it seemed to me they were often being coddled and protected.
[01:49:48.895 --> 01:49:59.239]  And I did not believe that the Interpol upper echelon was aggressively pursuing a strategy that would eliminate... And you know, and you said that you had the info they were using to blackmail.
[01:49:59.279 --> 01:50:04.900]  Now, you talk about Thailand, a military invasion, I'm all for it.
[01:50:05.581 --> 01:50:06.621]  I mean, that's pure evil.
[01:50:06.721 --> 01:50:13.223]  I mean, and in ten minutes Bush could get the evidence of what he needed to go into Thailand, but they don't even have sanctions on Thailand.
[01:50:13.663 --> 01:50:15.224]  We should have sanctions on them, shouldn't we?
[01:50:15.834 --> 01:50:16.815]  Not even sanctions.
[01:50:17.035 --> 01:50:34.544]  It amazes me that the things that we seem to worry about and obsess over and yet here are literally thousands of innocent children and I've been in Thailand on a number of assignments and we saw parents with children as young as two years old walking up to brothels to sell them into slavery.
[01:50:35.447 --> 01:50:43.294]  This should not be allowed by any of the... Those parents should have their heads blown off and the child should be given to adoption.
[01:50:43.594 --> 01:50:46.257]  And you see, here I am, hearing that, I want to kill them.
[01:50:46.297 --> 01:50:47.798]  I mean, I understand how you could do this.
[01:50:49.139 --> 01:50:56.686]  And by the way, we were mentioning that in the book there's a lot of information that those who are in the know will immediately recognize as accurate.
[01:50:57.162 --> 01:51:14.695]  Also, people who go to my website, DavidBannon.net, can go to the Press Library, where there are hundreds of pages of documentation to support this terrible, terrible... How do folks get the properly named book, Race Against Evil?
[01:51:15.896 --> 01:51:26.083]  Oh, they can pick it up through my website, and if they order it through there, we'll donate $1 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for every book they purchase.
[01:51:26.556 --> 01:51:28.879]  They can get it at any of their local bookstores as well.
[01:51:30.501 --> 01:51:30.942]  All right.
[01:51:31.142 --> 01:51:32.524]  We're going to break here in a second.
[01:51:32.544 --> 01:51:34.206]  You're going to stay with us until the next hour or so.
[01:51:34.226 --> 01:51:35.527]  I appreciate that, Donovan.
[01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:38.411]  Who's up first, Mark?
[01:51:38.431 --> 01:51:39.052]  You were telling me.
[01:51:39.352 --> 01:51:40.714]  We'll go ahead and go to one caller now.
[01:51:41.875 --> 01:51:42.096]  Who?
[01:51:42.276 --> 01:51:43.638]  Irving in Colorado.
[01:51:44.158 --> 01:51:44.659]  You're on the air.
[01:51:44.679 --> 01:51:45.220]  Go ahead, Irving.
[01:51:46.308 --> 01:52:01.752]  Yes, I wanted to know if Dr. Bannon could shed any light on the story in Massachusetts in 1980 in Watertown, Massachusetts, the arson ring and the murder ring for hire and the child sex for hire.
[01:52:02.532 --> 01:52:10.034]  It was discovered that police officials, retired and active clergy... That was actually in the newspaper.
[01:52:10.434 --> 01:52:11.774]  Any comments to that, Dr. Bannon?
[01:52:12.755 --> 01:52:14.055]  I am not familiar with that case.
[01:52:15.003 --> 01:52:17.885]  Okay, this goes back, like I said, to the 1980s.
[01:52:18.386 --> 01:52:20.047]  And it was basically just dropped.
[01:52:20.187 --> 01:52:23.089]  No one was ever persecuted, brought to trial, or anything.
[01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:25.731]  And I wanted to know if it was connected to the Ferraros.
[01:52:26.052 --> 01:52:30.175]  Geraldine Ferraro's husband, who was a foreign kingpin on the East Coast.
[01:52:30.922 --> 01:52:31.823]  I don't know about that.
[01:52:31.843 --> 01:52:34.324]  I remember the news articles saying something about them.
[01:52:35.184 --> 01:52:41.268]  We'll talk about it in the... I don't like to make unsubstantiated comments here, and we have enough stuff that's out in the open.
[01:52:41.988 --> 01:52:51.253]  Third hour coming up, and I got a bunch of news about war with North Korea, and Iran, and Syria, and the gun grabbing by the neocons trying to disarm us, and just everything else.
[01:52:51.293 --> 01:52:53.234]  We'll be right back with the third hour with our guest, your calls.
[01:52:54.175 --> 01:53:00.318]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared
[01:53:01.056 --> 01:53:12.246]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most ex... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.875 --> 01:53:24.037]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:53:24.718 --> 01:53:25.518]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.299 --> 01:53:27.179]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.199 --> 01:53:31.662]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.042 --> 01:53:36.144]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:36.365 --> 01:53:48.892]  Alright, we're talking about a horrible subject, but we don't talk about the pure wickedness, the abuse of kidnapped women and children that is in the millions every year.
[01:53:49.682 --> 01:53:52.644]  Just out of Eastern Europe alone, according to the U.N.'
[01:53:52.604 --> 01:53:54.164]  's own numbers, will continue.
[01:53:54.945 --> 01:53:55.745]  It is massive.
[01:53:56.145 --> 01:54:00.228]  Of course, the New American Magazine a few years ago published the video stills of U.N.
[01:54:00.248 --> 01:54:04.090]  peacekeepers burning small children over fires, cutting their heads off.
[01:54:06.371 --> 01:54:12.054]  They have art exposés on Channel 4, World of Wonder, a few months ago, where they eat dead babies on TV.
[01:54:13.163 --> 01:54:18.625]  So they're eating babies on TV and watching it as an art display on British national TV.
[01:54:18.665 --> 01:54:23.446]  So, I mean, this stuff's gotten so out in the open, it's everywhere now, and we cannot ignore it.
[01:54:23.486 --> 01:54:27.187]  Dr. David Race Bannon, PhD, is our guest.
[01:54:27.227 --> 01:54:38.951]  He was a assassin or cleaner for Interpol, killing low-level individuals and then collecting the data and using it at higher-up levels for blackmail against government officials.
[01:54:38.971 --> 01:54:40.671]  This is amazing stuff.
[01:54:40.691 --> 01:54:42.012]  He has a lot of courage to go public with this.
[01:54:42.032 --> 01:54:42.812]  We're taking calls.
[01:54:43.664 --> 01:54:45.066]  We'll talk to now Will.
[01:54:45.166 --> 01:54:47.028]  Will, where are you calling from, sir?
[01:54:49.050 --> 01:54:49.831]  In the country, Will.
[01:54:50.371 --> 01:54:50.752]  Hello, sir.
[01:54:50.772 --> 01:54:51.793]  Yes, where are you calling from?
[01:54:51.813 --> 01:54:52.834]  Yeah, I'm in Norfolk, Virginia.
[01:54:53.134 --> 01:54:55.016]  Okay, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:54:55.037 --> 01:54:55.397]  Go ahead.
[01:54:55.477 --> 01:54:55.897]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:55.937 --> 01:54:59.722]  Mr. Bannon, thank you for being on the program there, and thank you, Alex, for having him on.
[01:55:00.763 --> 01:55:04.707]  I would also urge you to look into John DeCant's book, The Franklin Cover-Up.
[01:55:05.373 --> 01:55:09.034]  It sounds to me like you're not just talking about the local pervert in his trench coat, but some really high
[01:55:29.131 --> 01:55:29.471]  I don't
[01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:52.411]  I have an interest in both these things.
[01:55:52.671 --> 01:55:55.613]  Well, the caller, obviously, Doctor, you're picking up on this.
[01:55:55.633 --> 01:56:02.437]  He's saying, just like the drug war, they go after the small-time dealer, but not the cartel leader who laundered his money through the big banks.
[01:56:03.357 --> 01:56:12.142]  Right, and certainly that is a very real part of this traffic, and there's been enough media coverage to support that.
[01:56:12.783 --> 01:56:17.865]  I should say this, it's easier, I think, for a lot of people to
[01:56:19.509 --> 01:56:24.997]  Imagine a child molester to be the creepy guy standing on the street corner.
[01:56:25.738 --> 01:56:34.530]  It's much more difficult to recognize that it is that the perpetrators are men and women of great influence in societies all across the world.
[01:56:35.114 --> 01:56:37.155]  And there is a lot of money involved.
[01:56:37.175 --> 01:56:38.915]  It's all about the exercise of power.
[01:56:38.975 --> 01:56:46.398]  These people exercise power, and they're sickos, and they're sadistic, and look, Nero did it, the Aztecs did it.
[01:56:46.878 --> 01:56:50.759]  Every time we look back in history, this is an elite practice, is it not, Doctor?
[01:56:51.299 --> 01:57:02.223]  It is very much so, and my PhD is in Asian history from Seoul National University, by the way, and I can assure you that all throughout Asian history, as well as Western history,
[01:57:02.799 --> 01:57:06.222]  The elite have pursued this grotesque and dark fetish.
[01:57:07.083 --> 01:57:08.584]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:09.305 --> 01:57:10.746]  That's the new world order for you.
[01:57:10.806 --> 01:57:11.647]  Pure trash.
[01:57:11.707 --> 01:57:12.287]  Pure evil.
[01:57:13.368 --> 01:57:14.309]  Anything else, Will?
[01:57:14.589 --> 01:57:15.470]  No, that's all.
[01:57:15.670 --> 01:57:16.290]  More power to you.
[01:57:16.651 --> 01:57:17.171]  Thank you, Will.
[01:57:17.411 --> 01:57:17.792]  There you go.
[01:57:17.812 --> 01:57:18.292]  Oh, man.
[01:57:19.033 --> 01:57:19.853]  You know what, listeners?
[01:57:19.873 --> 01:57:21.535]  You kept telling me to have this guy on.
[01:57:21.555 --> 01:57:23.536]  What he's saying is accurate, unfortunately.
[01:57:23.556 --> 01:57:25.598]  It's horrible.
[01:57:25.618 --> 01:57:26.779]  We have to talk about it.
[01:57:31.955 --> 01:57:32.815]  Well, we've got a break.
[01:57:32.835 --> 01:57:35.496]  We'll come back and talk to Dan, Wesley, John, and others.
[01:57:35.536 --> 01:57:36.636]  The toll-free number to join us.
[01:57:36.656 --> 01:57:39.158]  We're going to have our guest on for maybe two more segments.
[01:57:39.178 --> 01:57:43.019]  Then we'll get into other world news and other serious issues like World War III.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:44.920]  So that's coming up.
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:45.920]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:45.980]  800-259-9231.
[01:57:53.229 --> 01:57:56.990]  Also, a former defense secretary says nukes will go off in America.
[01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:58.011]  This is the Washington Post.
[01:57:58.771 --> 01:58:00.191]  Nukes will go off in America.
[01:58:00.211 --> 01:58:01.292]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[01:58:02.452 --> 01:58:03.413]  Somebody wake me up.
[01:58:04.553 --> 01:58:05.153]  But you know what?
[01:58:05.593 --> 01:58:08.434]  If we deny what's happening across the board, again, it just makes it worse.
[01:58:09.075 --> 01:58:12.336]  We have got to face the truth, no matter how horrible it is, and we're going to be safe.
[01:58:12.716 --> 01:58:13.156]  Be right back.
[01:58:15.214 --> 01:58:23.477]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:58:23.717 --> 01:58:28.078]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:58:28.379 --> 01:58:37.282]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:58:37.482 --> 01:58:41.123]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:58:41.403 --> 01:58:46.429]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:58:46.730 --> 01:58:53.438]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:58:53.948 --> 01:58:54.608]  What about you?
[01:58:55.249 --> 01:59:00.591]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:59:00.651 --> 01:59:01.672]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:59:01.812 --> 01:59:03.713]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:59:03.733 --> 01:59:06.454]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:59:19.131 --> 01:59:20.431]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:59:20.631 --> 01:59:26.373]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:59:26.653 --> 01:59:31.915]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:59:32.195 --> 01:59:36.296]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:59:36.516 --> 01:59:40.301]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:59:40.561 --> 01:59:45.207]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:59:45.267 --> 01:59:51.555]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:59:51.595 --> 01:59:53.418]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:59:53.898 --> 01:59:55.980]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[01:59:56.060 --> 01:59:59.422]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:59:59.743 --> 02:00:02.465]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:03.205 --> 02:00:07.588]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[02:00:07.708 --> 02:00:09.710]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[02:00:09.930 --> 02:00:11.451]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:00:11.631 --> 02:00:13.673]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:00:14.475 --> 02:00:19.739]  Most people realize that everyday life can be pretty unpredictable at times, but that doesn't mean your business has to be.
[02:00:19.959 --> 02:00:26.685]  A quick call to GTI Technologies is all it takes to put your business far ahead of the competition with the help of a predictive dialer.
[02:00:26.865 --> 02:00:31.769]  With a predictive dialer, your sales increase automatically as you eliminate no answers and answering machines.
[02:00:31.989 --> 02:00:34.090]  Imagine a live body on every call.
[02:00:34.291 --> 02:00:38.194]  Take the guesswork out of accidental calls to people on state or federal do not call lists.
[02:00:38.454 --> 02:00:41.156]  These kind of mistakes can cost a company thousands of dollars.
[02:00:41.416 --> 02:00:42.517]  GTI Technologies
[02:00:42.517 --> 02:00:42.857]  We're good.
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:40.138]  That's right, from Rochester, New York, to Austin, Texas, to Denver, Colorado, to Northern California, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Kansas City, Missouri, we blast out on the AM and FM dials, simulcast at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:41.179 --> 02:01:42.340]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:01:43.710 --> 02:01:45.551]  Our guest is Dr. David Bannon.
[02:01:45.591 --> 02:01:51.393]  His website is DavidBannon.net or you can simply go to Infowars.com where we post who our guests are.
[02:01:51.414 --> 02:01:56.836]  We just did a little bit later update today at about 1230 because we put up a lot of news stories today.
[02:01:58.099 --> 02:01:59.160]  A large update today.
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:00.721]  So go to Infowars.com.
[02:02:00.741 --> 02:02:07.526]  You can link through to DavidBannon.net if you forget the website or don't have the spelling.
[02:02:07.906 --> 02:02:10.848]  But it's DavidBannon.net.
[02:02:10.948 --> 02:02:13.350]  The book, Race Against Evil.
[02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:18.854]  And Dr. Bannon, I didn't bring my book to the studio today with me that I got last week.
[02:02:19.294 --> 02:02:20.335]  Who publishes your book?
[02:02:20.855 --> 02:02:21.896]  New Horizon Press.
[02:02:21.956 --> 02:02:23.577]  They're an imprint of Penguin Publishing.
[02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.831]  Wow, so a big publisher, was it?
[02:02:26.211 --> 02:02:36.516]  And folks, we interview a lot of folks who publish books, but they don't just let you write a book like this without checking it out.
[02:02:40.158 --> 02:02:45.420]  It's amazing, and reading the book, unfortunately, it looks accurate to me.
[02:02:46.041 --> 02:02:46.421]  I wish it
[02:02:47.794 --> 02:02:48.494]  Wasn't the case.
[02:02:48.554 --> 02:02:54.117]  I wish that the former Defense Secretary wasn't saying that we're quote, going to get nuked in the next year.
[02:02:54.177 --> 02:02:55.158]  That's the Washington Post.
[02:02:55.198 --> 02:03:02.601]  I mean, this is, it's like somebody put us into an alternate reality or shifted something.
[02:03:03.202 --> 02:03:05.463]  Or is it just that we're more aware of it now, Dr. Bannon?
[02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:16.703]  I do think that there has been a lot of work done by many individuals, particularly Andrew Vax, who's been a very vocal child advocate.
[02:03:17.363 --> 02:03:23.925]  And so I think it is a credit to humanity that in the past 20 years, there's been much more awareness of this problem.
[02:03:24.385 --> 02:03:26.786]  It's existed, certainly, for centuries.
[02:03:27.851 --> 02:03:30.014]  So it's an old institutionalized system.
[02:03:30.034 --> 02:03:30.876]  We keep going back to that.
[02:03:30.896 --> 02:03:37.205]  But I mean, you know, as a PhD, as someone who studied history, just all the overall craziness.
[02:03:37.665 --> 02:03:43.734]  The going to war with North Korea, Patriot Act 1 and 2, the borders are still wide open.
[02:03:44.807 --> 02:03:48.068]  Your analysis of the basic craziness of the world today?
[02:03:48.088 --> 02:03:52.590]  Oh, I confess that there's just nothing new in the world.
[02:03:53.211 --> 02:03:56.192]  The craziness is a continuation.
[02:03:56.252 --> 02:04:00.674]  I think that we have much more information than we've ever had and certainly we can thank shows like yours, Alex, for that.
[02:04:00.694 --> 02:04:01.454]  So that's really it?
[02:04:01.514 --> 02:04:04.395]  You think that it's... we're just more aware of it?
[02:04:04.636 --> 02:04:05.576]  Yes, very much so.
[02:04:06.719 --> 02:04:16.867]  To give you just a North Korea idea, I myself was imprisoned in a slave labor camp in North Korea when I was captured during an Interpol assignment.
[02:04:17.848 --> 02:04:23.893]  And my PhD is in Asian History from Seoul National University, so I like to pretend I know a lot about this country.
[02:04:24.548 --> 02:04:32.713]  I can assure you that North Korea has been working on weapons of mass destruction programs, biological, chemical weapons, for 20 years.
[02:04:32.753 --> 02:04:35.755]  Well, I've got articles 8 years old where they were testing nukes.
[02:04:36.576 --> 02:04:39.778]  This whole thing of you've got to attack them before they get nukes is a joke.
[02:04:39.978 --> 02:04:40.518]  Oh, it is.
[02:04:40.778 --> 02:04:41.099]  It is.
[02:04:41.299 --> 02:04:44.661]  It's a huge joke, and everyone on the inside has known this.
[02:04:45.336 --> 02:04:49.857]  It may be that it's now just more politically convenient... I've got to hear about this, Dr. Bannon.
[02:04:50.037 --> 02:04:53.578]  You're telling me... So you got captured in this North Korean camp.
[02:04:54.378 --> 02:04:55.098]  How did you get out?
[02:04:55.138 --> 02:04:55.778]  What was that like?
[02:04:55.798 --> 02:05:02.540]  Because we just read the Wall Street Journal article where they... where when the people starve to death, they hang out their carcasses and sell the meat.
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:03.840]  That is correct.
[02:05:04.501 --> 02:05:08.061]  And there are many horrendous torture methods involved.
[02:05:08.902 --> 02:05:14.683]  I was only there for a little under a week until I was traded back
[02:05:15.345 --> 02:05:18.326]  to South Korea in what's known as a spy swap.
[02:05:18.366 --> 02:05:22.987]  That is, there was a known mole in the South Korean Secret Service.
[02:05:23.207 --> 02:05:25.027]  He was actually a North Korean double agent.
[02:05:25.527 --> 02:05:28.368]  He had been captured and was traded back for me.
[02:05:28.388 --> 02:05:30.908]  I certainly couldn't have escaped on that.
[02:05:30.928 --> 02:05:32.189]  I bet you thank God for that one.
[02:05:32.769 --> 02:05:33.129]  What's that?
[02:05:33.689 --> 02:05:35.309]  I bet you thank God that you got out of there.
[02:05:35.329 --> 02:05:40.770]  Oh, I thank God and all of my friends with Interpol and the Korean Secret Service who came to my aid.
[02:05:40.831 --> 02:05:42.971]  Otherwise, I'd still be there if not dead.
[02:05:43.584 --> 02:05:50.771]  So the Communists, for a long time across the board, have been funding themselves, not just with drugs, but with the other garbage?
[02:05:52.012 --> 02:05:53.013]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:05:55.075 --> 02:05:59.919]  Any terrorist cell is going to use whatever means necessary to fund its activities.
[02:06:01.481 --> 02:06:08.187]  I was involved in a joint operation with Interpol and the counter-terrorist French DST agency
[02:06:08.909 --> 02:06:20.057]  Uh, where we approached a cell of North Korean terrorists who were using child pornography and buying and selling children to fund their activities, including a bombing of the Paris Embassy.
[02:06:20.077 --> 02:06:34.266]  Uh, during that confrontation, my, uh, fiancee, Sude Rimbaud, who was a, uh, an officer with the DST, was killed protecting the lives of others by a North Korean terrorist.
[02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:41.632]  And that's what ultimately led to my willingly embracing the role that we played of eliminating these individuals.
[02:06:43.312 --> 02:06:45.012]  And she died in your arms?
[02:06:45.893 --> 02:06:46.873]  Yes, she did.
[02:06:46.913 --> 02:06:52.954]  She died there on the street, and after she was shot, it was really just a moment, just one or two minutes before she died.
[02:06:52.974 --> 02:06:58.336]  That's just amazing, and this is all on the record, folks.
[02:06:58.436 --> 02:06:59.096]  Just incredible.
[02:06:59.116 --> 02:07:00.696]  Let's talk to Dan in Illinois.
[02:07:00.756 --> 02:07:01.476]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:07:01.496 --> 02:07:01.877]  Go ahead.
[02:07:01.897 --> 02:07:02.797]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:07:04.451 --> 02:07:15.134]  The last caller kind of touched on what I was going to say, but the fact that you couldn't pursue the higher-ups, isn't this like the equivalent of being controlled by the same kind of perverts you were chasing?
[02:07:17.415 --> 02:07:33.660]  An excellent question, and certainly as time went on, as I matured as an individual and learned more about the entire operations of the organization for which I worked, I realized that we were not necessarily a solution, but really just a duct tape job.
[02:07:34.196 --> 02:07:37.022]  And that was one of the many reasons I ultimately left Interpol.
[02:07:37.944 --> 02:07:40.931]  Yeah, I'm glad to hear that.
[02:07:40.951 --> 02:07:42.775]  It is very hypocritical in the long run.
[02:07:43.886 --> 02:07:45.707]  And it's so much like corruption is.
[02:07:45.787 --> 02:07:47.949]  It's like, do as I say, don't do as I do.
[02:07:48.369 --> 02:07:48.989]  Right, right.
[02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:50.550]  Okay, well thank you.
[02:07:50.951 --> 02:07:52.712]  Absolutely, well it's like that everywhere.
[02:07:52.752 --> 02:07:54.033]  I mean, you have the British and the U.S.
[02:07:54.073 --> 02:08:10.483]  government are the real proliferators of the reactors, of the uranium, of the missile parts, and then they'll ignore all that when they've got evidence of weapons of mass destruction, because they've got the receipt, and they'll just make something up to legitimize what they're doing.
[02:08:10.503 --> 02:08:11.444]  It's incredible.
[02:08:13.476 --> 02:08:14.037]  Unbelievable.
[02:08:14.357 --> 02:08:17.179]  Let's talk to Wesley in Tennessee.
[02:08:17.239 --> 02:08:19.160]  Wesley, you're on the air with our guest, Dr. Bannon.
[02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:19.541]  Go ahead.
[02:08:20.021 --> 02:08:21.002]  Hi, Dr. Bannon.
[02:08:21.262 --> 02:08:22.163]  How are you today, Alex?
[02:08:23.223 --> 02:08:24.164]  I guess I'm doing all right.
[02:08:25.025 --> 02:08:40.836]  Alex, you mentioned something before about if we take out guys like this, that we're not any better than the Vietnamese that shot American pilots, but I beg to correct you on that.
[02:08:40.856 --> 02:08:41.597]  We were the good guys.
[02:08:43.899 --> 02:08:49.963]  When you do something like that, it's an irreversible decision.
[02:08:49.983 --> 02:08:53.766]  Hold on, hold on, Leslie.
[02:08:54.927 --> 02:09:05.554]  I've said that the emotions I have at hearing Dr. Bannon talk about parents selling their kids into this, is that my emotion is, blow their heads off.
[02:09:06.355 --> 02:09:08.496]  But, when you go down that road then,
[02:09:11.835 --> 02:09:11.915]  It's
[02:09:30.271 --> 02:09:32.472]  I'm sorry, I stand corrected that I misunderstood you.
[02:09:32.492 --> 02:09:35.153]  I wanted to say I'm the guy that got yanked out of my car and hit a
[02:09:47.796 --> 02:09:50.897]  9mm Kel-Tec stolen out of the trunk of my car.
[02:09:50.917 --> 02:09:53.058]  It's been a long time since I talked to you.
[02:09:53.698 --> 02:10:09.083]  You called about a year ago and said you were there in Tennessee, you're a WBCR listener, and it was in the paper, the Army was out just running checkpoints, this was before 9-1-1, and they jerked you out of your car and you're in a wheelchair and roughed you up a bit and stole your gun.
[02:10:09.283 --> 02:10:10.183]  Well, you'd be proud of me.
[02:10:10.243 --> 02:10:15.785]  I got stopped at a road check on the 4th of July and I absolutely refused to
[02:10:17.321 --> 02:10:28.669]  To display my license that I refused to let anybody search my car and I told them if they wanted to search it, they were going to have to come back with a warrant from a, signed and sealed from a judge.
[02:10:28.949 --> 02:10:29.709]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:10:29.769 --> 02:10:34.272]  After about a half an hour of standing around they just finally got tired of it and told me to get in my car and go.
[02:10:34.953 --> 02:10:40.016]  Exactly, but on the subject at hand here, any comments, Wesley?
[02:10:42.318 --> 02:10:43.319]  I just wanted to say that
[02:10:46.303 --> 02:11:05.289]  In your own local neighborhood, Alex, if you knew of somebody that was engaged in child pornography, and you didn't have a shadow of a doubt of the guilt of the perpetrator, how would you suggest people handle something like that?
[02:11:05.789 --> 02:11:06.389]  I don't know.
[02:11:06.409 --> 02:11:11.031]  I guess call the police, but then nothing will probably happen to them.
[02:11:11.071 --> 02:11:11.491]  I don't know.
[02:11:11.531 --> 02:11:12.351]  Dr. Bannon, what would you do?
[02:11:13.543 --> 02:11:34.912]  Oh, I hope to never be faced with that again, although I must say this, the years of Archangel training and experience have a heavy toll in that even now when I go to church, I find myself immediately scanning for the individuals whose behavior betrays their dark fetish.
[02:11:36.113 --> 02:11:40.035]  I can say this, however, there are indeed many decent working
[02:11:41.864 --> 02:11:52.935]  FBI officers in the country who are working with the Innocent Images Program and the Crimes Against Children Programs who can be contacted directly through the FBI's website.
[02:11:53.276 --> 02:11:55.838]  And also I would add to this that
[02:11:58.306 --> 02:12:24.353]  that on the wider scale uh... dealing with this uh... corruption uh... that uh... most people in the government are are not involved in this but that statistically the number one group when I read the newspaper Dr. Bennington said if I'm right or wrong that it's the child counselor it's the cps worker uh... it's the truancy officer I know they bust a lot of them here in Austin
[02:12:25.193 --> 02:12:32.436]  Don't these predators try to get into positions of power over children or the Boy Scout leader?
[02:12:32.456 --> 02:12:34.256]  I mean, isn't that who you've got to watch?
[02:12:34.956 --> 02:12:37.137]  Very much so, and well said, Alex.
[02:12:37.317 --> 02:12:38.578]  It fits the profile.
[02:12:39.098 --> 02:12:51.982]  It should never surprise us when we learn that a Sunday school teacher, a daycare worker, a truancy officer, guidance counselor, high school teacher, that these individuals are molesting children because part of the profile, as horrible as it sounds,
[02:12:52.615 --> 02:12:55.996]  is that they truly enjoy and love children.
[02:12:56.577 --> 02:13:03.739]  The dark evil part, of course, is that they also want to have sex with them and they are attracted to that profession.
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:12.123]  And then, there are the people running the CPS, taking your kids, and Time Magazine reported, they're five times more likely to abuse your child than a parent is.
[02:13:12.163 --> 02:13:12.923]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:15.513 --> 02:13:24.119]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.

[02:13:38.829 --> 02:13:42.932]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:13:43.152 --> 02:13:45.274]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:13:45.434 --> 02:13:47.315]  That's because it has an elevated base.

[02:17:53.344 --> 02:17:55.105]  John in Tennessee, or is it Texas?
[02:17:55.445 --> 02:17:56.486]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:17:57.867 --> 02:18:02.291]  Yes, are you aware of the Stanley Hilton class action against Bush Jr.
[02:18:02.311 --> 02:18:07.795]  for perping the 9-1-1 massacre and that CIA Director Bush Sr.
[02:18:07.835 --> 02:18:14.280]  protected the snuffed kiddie porn at the Franklin SNL cover-up in Bohemian Grove where Alex infiltrated with hidden video?
[02:18:16.622 --> 02:18:16.742]  Yes.
[02:18:32.393 --> 02:18:38.297]  It was three years ago, in two days, I snuck into Bohemian Grove and there wasn't any stuff going on with children.
[02:18:38.337 --> 02:18:43.040]  It was a satanic ritual that I shot on video that's aired on the Trio Network.
[02:18:44.922 --> 02:18:45.722]  I should say this.
[02:18:46.222 --> 02:18:49.284]  We've had a number of good questions about cases here in the United States.
[02:18:49.745 --> 02:18:56.689]  My work was primarily based in Europe and Asia, and so I confess ignorance on a number of these particular cases.
[02:18:58.451 --> 02:19:01.873]  Alex, has the murder ever been solved of your friend who went back to the Grove?
[02:19:03.743 --> 02:19:04.624]  A murder of who?
[02:19:04.684 --> 02:19:06.805]  No, that was an internet rumor.
[02:19:07.305 --> 02:19:08.526]  Ed Holman was never murdered.
[02:19:08.586 --> 02:19:12.328]  He divorced his wife and moved to Houston, and I've seen Ed four or five times.
[02:19:12.649 --> 02:19:13.089]  Okay.
[02:19:13.409 --> 02:19:17.472]  Now that shows the type of stuff that goes on around here.
[02:19:17.552 --> 02:19:19.753]  People focus on stuff that isn't accurate.
[02:19:20.173 --> 02:19:21.014]  Okay, thank you.
[02:19:21.214 --> 02:19:24.196]  Okay, Ed went for another software job in
[02:19:25.785 --> 02:19:28.386]  Ed Homan went and covered the Grove the second year of the protest.
[02:19:28.666 --> 02:19:31.868]  They're going on right now again for the third year since I snuck in.
[02:19:32.488 --> 02:19:34.589]  And then he got divorced and moved.
[02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:35.989]  Everybody was saying, Ed's dead.
[02:19:36.069 --> 02:19:37.590]  It's the kind of stuff I deal with.
[02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:41.492]  Like Mark Twain said, the reports of his death are greatly exaggerated.
[02:19:41.812 --> 02:19:42.892]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:19:43.572 --> 02:19:50.735]  Let's go ahead and talk to, I guess, Keith in Florida is up next.
[02:19:50.775 --> 02:19:51.255]  Go ahead, Keith.
[02:19:51.275 --> 02:19:52.336]  You're on the air with Dr. Bannon.
[02:19:52.356 --> 02:19:54.897]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones and Dr. O'Bannon.
[02:19:55.710 --> 02:19:56.771]  Question, Mr. O'Bannon.
[02:19:57.131 --> 02:19:58.391]  Would you ever produce... Bannon.
[02:19:58.511 --> 02:19:58.951]  O'Bannon?
[02:19:59.532 --> 02:19:59.932]  Bannon.
[02:20:00.212 --> 02:20:00.632]  Bannon.
[02:20:00.712 --> 02:20:01.152]  I'm sorry.
[02:20:02.293 --> 02:20:03.053]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:20:03.233 --> 02:20:13.077]  Question, would he ever produce a list of people in corporations, high government, or high religious areas by name who are in the United States or globally?
[02:20:13.097 --> 02:20:19.639]  You know what I'm saying, like a list of them that were involved, that he was privy to, that he couldn't go after?
[02:20:19.659 --> 02:20:24.041]  An excellent question and one I've been asked repeatedly.
[02:20:25.181 --> 02:20:38.773]  If I may say this, and I'm entirely selfish in this account, but that is part of the large amount of documentation that I keep secret as an insurance policy for myself and my family.
[02:20:39.313 --> 02:20:49.823]  Understand this, if he was going to release that, he had better release it to a hundred sources before he announced it, because if he was going to release that, they would kill him in a minute.
[02:20:50.399 --> 02:20:51.200]  Well, I understand that, sir.
[02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:52.340]  And that's what I've said before.
[02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:54.681]  You're only safe by going public, folks.
[02:20:55.022 --> 02:20:56.703]  Not by hiding and sneaking around.
[02:20:56.923 --> 02:20:57.183]  Right.
[02:20:57.643 --> 02:21:01.045]  And certainly, that is an insurance policy to have that.
[02:21:01.405 --> 02:21:06.108]  But I guarantee if you did release it, they would probably whack you as well.
[02:21:06.148 --> 02:21:06.568]  Who knows?
[02:21:06.968 --> 02:21:07.329]  Oh, yes.
[02:21:07.549 --> 02:21:09.090]  And I think what you said is accurate.
[02:21:09.150 --> 02:21:13.972]  I would have to release it in such a blanket release worldwide.
[02:21:14.053 --> 02:21:15.633]  And I guarantee you, you're under surveillance.
[02:21:16.334 --> 02:21:16.834]  Oh, every day.
[02:21:16.854 --> 02:21:18.015]  Okay.
[02:21:18.395 --> 02:21:18.575]  All right.
[02:21:18.595 --> 02:21:19.095]  Thank you, doctor.
[02:21:19.396 --> 02:21:19.656]  Thank you.
[02:21:21.255 --> 02:21:25.196]  Yeah, so and I mean, it's probably dangerous for your life to even discuss releasing it.
[02:21:26.396 --> 02:21:27.297]  Absolutely correct.
[02:21:27.417 --> 02:21:32.138]  And I should say, it is an insurance policy that I hold on to.
[02:21:33.078 --> 02:21:39.580]  And it is, there's within the intelligence community, a number of operatives, lower level operatives who all work with each other.
[02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:46.942]  So that if one were to happen to one, if something were to happen to one, then the others in another country would immediately release
[02:21:47.846 --> 02:21:51.528]  The information that you've amassed over the years.
[02:21:52.229 --> 02:21:56.811]  This is the only insurance these operatives have against their own government.
[02:21:56.991 --> 02:21:57.471]  You got it.
[02:21:57.932 --> 02:22:01.294]  Larry in Indiana, you're on the air, Larry, go ahead.
[02:22:01.834 --> 02:22:12.700]  Mr. Bannon, confirmation of what you're saying here, it's a distasteful topic, but I was reading about 18-month-old kids being tortured and raped, etc., as part of the
[02:22:13.698 --> 02:22:19.020]  Absolutely, and the MKUltra program is notorious for not only abusing these children,
[02:22:43.653 --> 02:22:47.176]  But also, many of the doctors were sexually molesting them as well.
[02:22:47.957 --> 02:22:54.062]  For those listeners who may not be... I'll tell you what, Dr. Bannon, do five more minutes with us on the other side so we can let Larry finish up, and then go to Pam.
[02:22:54.082 --> 02:22:56.804]  And that's it for calls, because I've got to cover World War III stuff.
[02:22:57.745 --> 02:23:00.387]  Just as serious, if that's actually possible, but it is.
[02:23:01.007 --> 02:23:01.868]  We'll be right back.
[02:23:02.148 --> 02:23:03.229]  Please stay with us.
[02:23:05.711 --> 02:23:06.592]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.092 --> 02:23:08.694]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.615 --> 02:23:12.297]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.516 --> 02:23:18.258]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[02:23:18.478 --> 02:23:24.802]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[02:23:25.082 --> 02:23:28.064]  Would you like to make your asset?
[02:23:28.084 --> 02:23:32.807]  877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com for more information.
[02:23:33.007 --> 02:23:35.469]  And do your body right with Cardivite.
[02:23:57.214 --> 02:24:00.416]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 and back from 9 to midnight central.
[02:24:01.196 --> 02:24:05.738]  We're here live, our final segment with Dr. David Bannon.
[02:24:06.178 --> 02:24:08.980]  The website is davidbannon.net.
[02:24:10.561 --> 02:24:19.485]  And let's go back to Larry in Indiana bringing up some of the horrible details that have been documented by Senator DeCamp and others.
[02:24:19.545 --> 02:24:21.266]  Unfortunately, I wish it wasn't going on.
[02:24:21.286 --> 02:24:22.286]  I wish it wasn't true.
[02:24:25.387 --> 02:24:28.753]  Again, the globalists count on us not being able to believe the horror.
[02:24:28.853 --> 02:24:30.516]  Larry, anything else you'd like to bring up, sir?
[02:24:30.717 --> 02:24:35.746]  Well, like we're supposed to believe, Amber, or it's really for the children when the CIA goes out and finds them for this.
[02:24:35.826 --> 02:24:36.547]  I would add that...
[02:24:37.526 --> 02:24:40.808]  Fritz Spritmeier did get the kind of reward you guys are talking about.
[02:24:40.868 --> 02:24:45.712]  They set him up on bogus robbery charges, bank robbery charges, just like Mark Kornke.
[02:24:45.752 --> 02:24:47.813]  And he's in prison now for his work.
[02:24:47.833 --> 02:24:50.034]  So that's how they reward you for getting the truth out.
[02:24:50.315 --> 02:24:52.736]  You know, that is amazing, because they admit with Mark Kornke.
[02:24:52.756 --> 02:24:53.597]  They have the video.
[02:24:53.657 --> 02:24:54.397]  It wasn't him.
[02:24:54.497 --> 02:24:55.758]  Later, they said, OK, it wasn't.
[02:24:55.798 --> 02:24:58.100]  But he ran from the police.
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:00.541]  And the same thing was with Fritz Spritmeier.
[02:25:00.722 --> 02:25:05.245]  I mean, they kept going after him, Spritmeier, over and over again.
[02:25:05.265 --> 02:25:07.206]  And then just said, with no witnesses, oh, you're a bank robber.
[02:25:08.289 --> 02:25:11.111]  It's amazing that this stuff goes on.
[02:25:11.512 --> 02:25:17.616]  And now they have people out trying to discredit his work, pretending to be MKUltra victims themselves, Alex.
[02:25:18.037 --> 02:25:25.722]  His is really good, valid material, and by reading one of his books, I knew that movie, The Matrix, was loaded with those trigger cues to set those kids off.
[02:25:27.203 --> 02:25:32.728]  Well, it's truth is strange with infection, and we've been too naive too long, and
[02:25:33.632 --> 02:25:34.713]  We've got to check into it.
[02:25:35.534 --> 02:25:38.216]  Any comments, Dr. Bannon, to what Larry's saying?
[02:25:38.896 --> 02:25:42.559]  Well, we had mentioned the MKUltra program, and I do want to say this.
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:47.864]  Those types of programs not only exist in our country, but all across the world.
[02:25:47.984 --> 02:25:52.808]  I certainly saw evidence of them in both South and North Korea and China.
[02:25:53.949 --> 02:25:56.171]  Other than that, I think that, as you said,
[02:25:57.057 --> 02:26:10.113]  The best defense we have against all of this type of grotesque traffic of children and the abuse of them, whether through mind control or the sex trade, is awareness.
[02:26:10.133 --> 02:26:15.979]  You can't change anything if you don't expose the tools of the devil, no matter how grotesque the topic.
[02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:17.261]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[02:26:17.882 --> 02:26:18.543]  Absolutely.
[02:26:18.943 --> 02:26:19.624]  Absolutely.
[02:26:19.824 --> 02:26:22.207]  And it's something that has to be discussed.
[02:26:22.227 --> 02:26:24.890]  Pam in Missouri, last caller for our guest, Dr. Bannon.
[02:26:24.910 --> 02:26:25.270]  Go ahead.
[02:26:25.851 --> 02:26:27.392]  Hi Alex and Dr. Bannon.
[02:26:27.432 --> 02:26:28.974]  Thank you both for your work.
[02:26:29.855 --> 02:26:31.697]  And those two callers stole my thunder.
[02:26:31.757 --> 02:26:36.342]  I was going to ask, please expose them if you know who the higher-ups are.
[02:26:36.642 --> 02:26:39.385]  That's the only way to stop it.
[02:26:40.345 --> 02:26:44.334]  And if we don't expose them and don't stop them, it will continue.
[02:26:44.775 --> 02:26:47.641]  I understand your need to protect your family.
[02:26:47.661 --> 02:26:50.387]  Pam, you're right, but the Washington Times...
[02:26:51.369 --> 02:26:52.510]  Uh, Parade Magazine.
[02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:54.752]  I mean, it's in my, uh, Bohemian Grove film.
[02:26:55.593 --> 02:26:57.475]  Uh, we don't get into the stuff with the children.
[02:26:57.535 --> 02:27:03.781]  It's just the Washington Times saying these neo-conservatives, uh, fly in the high-dollar male prostitutes.
[02:27:04.061 --> 02:27:08.325]  I mean, and then, and then, and then they run around dressed like women.
[02:27:08.345 --> 02:27:10.927]  You know, Secretary of State, former President.
[02:27:11.007 --> 02:27:13.610]  I mean, that's, that's the Washington Times.
[02:27:13.650 --> 02:27:14.911]  Hold on, hold on, Pam.
[02:27:15.391 --> 02:27:16.833]  That's the Washington Times.
[02:27:17.771 --> 02:27:25.059]  And then I'll be on some Christian talk show as a guest and they'll attack me going, you're not a good American for saying that about the former president.
[02:27:25.079 --> 02:27:30.405]  And I'm reading the Washington Times and what Davin Gergen says they do there.
[02:27:31.987 --> 02:27:34.690]  Dr. Bannon, you weren't aware of Bohemian Grove or Skull & Bones?
[02:27:35.471 --> 02:27:35.571]  No.
[02:27:37.422 --> 02:27:40.343]  Boy, is that a whole other... How did the occult feed in?
[02:27:40.363 --> 02:27:45.365]  I mean, did you ever run into the occult when you were investigating these sicko rings overseas?
[02:27:45.925 --> 02:27:48.086]  Yes, we did, but I should say this.
[02:27:48.166 --> 02:27:50.487]  It did not appear to be a causal factor.
[02:27:51.027 --> 02:27:57.710]  We found that these individuals who molest and buy and sell children cross all religious boundaries.
[02:27:58.171 --> 02:28:00.613]  Well, of course, but what I was saying is that
[02:28:20.046 --> 02:28:20.286]  Yes, Pam.
[02:28:20.346 --> 02:28:22.507]  May I speak something directly to Dr. Bannon?
[02:28:22.527 --> 02:28:22.927]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:28:22.967 --> 02:28:25.167]  Concerning his... I know how he feels the guilt
[02:28:49.528 --> 02:28:54.232]  About what he did, but I want him to remember that God does not change.
[02:28:54.252 --> 02:28:56.714]  He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[02:28:57.134 --> 02:28:59.616]  He had many people put to death for their evil.
[02:29:00.417 --> 02:29:02.438]  Read God's Word and repent.
[02:29:02.919 --> 02:29:06.922]  If you feel badly, repent of it and know that you're forgiven.
[02:29:07.302 --> 02:29:08.423]  But you did right.
[02:29:09.544 --> 02:29:10.225]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:29:10.405 --> 02:29:17.531]  And of course, Pam's talking about Dr. Bannon knifing these people.
[02:29:19.199 --> 02:29:19.679]  Thanks, Pam.
[02:29:19.699 --> 02:29:21.620]  Is that normally how you executed them?
[02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:22.640]  Was it with a knife?
[02:29:23.661 --> 02:29:24.901]  Primarily, yes.
[02:29:25.021 --> 02:29:29.423]  My expertise was with bladed weapons and close quarter combat.
[02:29:30.183 --> 02:29:33.064]  But you say you generally interrogated them before killing them.
[02:29:33.704 --> 02:29:34.965]  Yes, often we did.
[02:29:34.985 --> 02:29:38.526]  Did these scumbags usually fight back or did they just grovel?
[02:29:41.151 --> 02:29:49.038]  It depended on the individual, and I can say that there are many occasions where, thank God I was with the team, because some of these scumbags were very tough.
[02:29:49.978 --> 02:29:52.621]  We'd like to think of them all being cowards, but they weren't.
[02:29:53.281 --> 02:29:55.003]  There were grovelers as well, however.
[02:29:57.445 --> 02:29:58.906]  My goodness, alrighty.
[02:29:59.126 --> 02:30:05.372]  I'm going to let you go, Doctor, but can you tell us one story of one of these guys that fought back and what you did?
[02:30:06.394 --> 02:30:06.734]  Sure.
[02:30:07.134 --> 02:30:11.895]  We had talked in the previous hour about an assignment I had in Communist Romania.
[02:30:12.355 --> 02:30:14.596]  My first assignment, as a matter of fact.
[02:30:14.996 --> 02:30:22.938]  The individual that I was tracking took a day trip off to Castle Dracula in Transylvania, of all places.
[02:30:22.998 --> 02:30:25.399]  He was taking the tour there and left the tour.
[02:30:25.599 --> 02:30:26.319]  I followed him.
[02:30:26.659 --> 02:30:27.579]  He was under surveillance.
[02:30:28.239 --> 02:30:35.221]  And as I followed him, he went into an alley and met a Romanian man where they trotted out a young three-year-old
[02:30:35.914 --> 02:30:41.577]  Girl and he was going to purchase the girl and also they began to molest the child.
[02:30:42.618 --> 02:30:53.124]  I ran down the alley furious at what I was witnessing and both individuals were particularly adept at unarmed combat and fought back strenuously.
[02:30:53.464 --> 02:31:02.889]  The physical confrontation that ensued certainly drew attention from the Securitate, which was the Secret Service in Romania.
[02:31:04.034 --> 02:31:10.579]  However, the investigating officer had Interpol connections and I was able to be released from that country.
[02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:22.388]  Whenever we had an occasion that someone fought back like that, our greatest fear was that either their Confederates or the local law enforcement would expose Interpol's role.
[02:31:22.408 --> 02:31:26.712]  So you got emotional on your first mission seeing this and kind of ran into it?
[02:31:27.052 --> 02:31:28.053]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:31:28.133 --> 02:31:29.374]  How did you finally take them out?
[02:31:30.380 --> 02:31:50.188]  Uh, the one individual I used the butt of the knife to collapse his windpipe, which later I saw had killed him, and the second individual, the one I'd been tracking in the first place, I used a kidney strike in his back, which, uh, with the bladed weapon, which generally paralyzes and causes death within minutes.
[02:31:52.228 --> 02:31:53.489]  Well, it's, uh...
[02:31:54.449 --> 02:32:03.673]  It's amazing and we really appreciate you coming on and perhaps we can have you back up again in the future to get into some of the other areas of this.
[02:32:03.993 --> 02:32:15.998]  It's obviously a large subject and just God bless you for coming forward and discussing this and I agree with the listeners, you need to expose these people to higher ups and
[02:32:17.416 --> 02:32:23.641]  And everybody needs to pray for you, Dr. Bannon, because you've already got Interpol coming to you trying to get you to sign that paper.
[02:32:23.701 --> 02:32:28.084]  I think if you sign that paper saying none of this is true, I think you're signing your death warrant.
[02:32:28.104 --> 02:32:28.524]  Do you agree?
[02:32:28.904 --> 02:32:29.224]  I do.
[02:32:30.806 --> 02:32:31.046]  All right.
[02:32:31.066 --> 02:32:31.706]  Well, God bless you.
[02:32:31.726 --> 02:32:32.567]  We appreciate you coming on.
[02:32:32.847 --> 02:32:33.387]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:32:33.648 --> 02:32:34.088]  Take care.
[02:32:35.789 --> 02:32:37.450]  Oh, man, that is hard to talk about.
[02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:38.991]  It is so horrible and scary.
[02:32:39.071 --> 02:32:44.075]  But, you know, it's like the first hour of the show we had the family on out of the New York Post.
[02:32:45.311 --> 02:32:48.754]  We had Angela Lipsman and her father, Daniel Lipsman.
[02:32:48.814 --> 02:33:03.107]  She is now about to be a graduate of a college at 15 with a 3.8.4 and they're going to move with criminal charges against them for not sending her to public school and they're not going to allow her to have her college degree.
[02:33:03.147 --> 02:33:04.508]  They're threatening the university.
[02:33:04.928 --> 02:33:05.829]  I mean, see, they're evil.
[02:33:06.650 --> 02:33:08.932]  And you heard Dr. Bannon say the CPS workers
[02:33:09.968 --> 02:33:15.972]  The school teachers, the family court judges, these, and let me tell you something, they're all over the place.
[02:33:15.992 --> 02:33:17.533]  This is where they concentrate.
[02:33:18.734 --> 02:33:34.184]  And I have been to the government meetings, I've debated these people, I've resisted them on subjects where they're trying to destroy parental rights, and you can look at them, as Dr. Bannon was saying, you can look at them and they are bags of pus.
[02:33:35.145 --> 02:33:36.986]  They are inhuman trash.
[02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:42.375]  And they busted a bunch of them here locally, because there are good cops and good police and good FBI.
[02:33:43.036 --> 02:33:45.658]  And they get busted, but it never goes higher than the low level.
[02:33:46.139 --> 02:33:47.260]  So you want to know where they're at?
[02:33:48.041 --> 02:33:49.042]  They're in the courthouse.
[02:33:49.282 --> 02:33:50.303]  They're in the schoolhouse.
[02:33:50.904 --> 02:33:54.108]  They're the truancy officers, the greatest concentration we know of.
[02:33:54.348 --> 02:33:56.010]  I mean, I see articles in the newswires.
[02:33:56.030 --> 02:33:59.754]  And again, we're just scanning newswires, scanning newswires for old stories.
[02:34:01.591 --> 02:34:05.896]  And we come across this type of stuff, and it's, uh, watch out.
[02:34:05.936 --> 02:34:14.905]  The truancy officers, uh, masses of people running the databases and CPS, as the Miami Herald reported, top convicted pedophiles.
[02:34:14.965 --> 02:34:17.707]  And the government said, hey, they're allowed to run the database.
[02:34:17.747 --> 02:34:19.169]  Talk about the fox guard and the hen house.
[02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:22.212]  And it is terrifying, especially to parents.
[02:34:23.349 --> 02:34:31.196]  It is just to know that they're in the government, they're running things, we're counting on good officers, good people, to blow the whistle, to have the courage like Dr. Bannon.
[02:34:32.937 --> 02:34:38.722]  And I'll have to tell you, we'll have to have a debate about this another day.
[02:34:39.143 --> 02:34:42.886]  Is it good to go, once you see the evidence of this, to execute them without a trial?
[02:34:44.810 --> 02:34:48.392]  I can see how they sell our special forces on killing Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
[02:34:48.452 --> 02:34:50.413]  But see, it turned out they weren't Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
[02:34:50.433 --> 02:34:51.333]  See, it's the same story.
[02:34:51.353 --> 02:34:58.136]  Either they're killing low-level people and protecting the high-level, and then all this does is create a cadre that'll carry this out who's been compromised.
[02:34:58.176 --> 02:34:59.957]  And his book gets into how then he was compromised.
[02:34:59.977 --> 02:35:03.178]  I'm not going to take any more calls.
[02:35:03.258 --> 02:35:06.460]  Just to give you an idea of the type of stuff I see on the news wires, I want to run through this.
[02:35:08.618 --> 02:35:10.499]  I just want to run through some of what we have here.
[02:35:10.519 --> 02:35:12.459]  New terror message threatens the U.S.
[02:35:12.839 --> 02:35:16.340]  and again the government's come out and had to admit they put out fake terror alerts to scare us.
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:25.843]  A Dubai radio station has broadcast a message attributed to Al-Qaeda terrorist network, that means CIA, threatening to attack U.S.
[02:35:25.903 --> 02:35:27.183]  interests throughout the world.
[02:35:27.583 --> 02:35:28.364]  We are threatening U.S.
[02:35:28.404 --> 02:35:36.866]  troops and all those who support them by intensifying our resistance operations and our jihad and the strike of the American interest in Afghanistan.
[02:35:37.897 --> 02:35:41.141]  And of course Dubai is where the CIA met with Bin Laden right before 9-1-1.
[02:35:41.301 --> 02:35:49.351]  And the head of Pakistan intelligence who was funding Mohammed Adda and others was at the White House and Congress with the heads of the committees.
[02:35:50.434 --> 02:35:52.675]  U.S.-North Korea drifting towards war, Perry warns.
[02:35:52.715 --> 02:35:56.315]  Former Defense Secretary says standoff between the risk of terrorists obtained a device.
[02:35:56.335 --> 02:35:59.196]  He went on to say, quote, I think we're losing control.
[02:35:59.596 --> 02:36:01.737]  We are going to have a nuclear event in this country.
[02:36:01.757 --> 02:36:08.098]  Former Defense Secretary William Perry warned the United States and North Korea are drifting towards war, perhaps as early as this year.
[02:36:08.438 --> 02:36:12.699]  Will Richard Perle, the Deputy Defense Secretary, will policy wonk?
[02:36:13.199 --> 02:36:17.800]  Deputy Defense Secretary is Wolfowitz, but he's basically the acting subdivision guy.
[02:36:18.570 --> 02:36:22.691]  I said a few months ago at a White House press dinner, quote, we're going to be attacking North Korea.
[02:36:23.192 --> 02:36:24.552]  Rumsfeld released the documents.
[02:36:24.572 --> 02:36:26.233]  They plan to attack in October.
[02:36:26.633 --> 02:36:30.014]  Now we have three separate plans of how to do it with pinpoint nukes.
[02:36:31.154 --> 02:36:34.776]  And, uh, why release that even if they're going to do it?
[02:36:35.156 --> 02:36:36.636]  I mean, that endangers our troops.
[02:36:36.736 --> 02:36:40.117]  I mean, again, I can't defend North Korea, folks, but it's sitting there.
[02:36:40.257 --> 02:36:41.278]  Our government's armed them.
[02:36:42.918 --> 02:36:44.999]  And it's going to have a lot of casualties, folks.
[02:36:45.119 --> 02:36:45.899]  That is guaranteed.
[02:36:45.939 --> 02:36:47.980]  I mean, North Koreans commit suicide when they're captured.
[02:36:48.584 --> 02:36:51.346]  Talk about a brainwashed covey of mind control slaves.
[02:36:52.848 --> 02:36:54.910]  Senate to kill Pentagon surveillance bill.
[02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:56.271]  That is absolutely false.
[02:36:56.631 --> 02:36:59.273]  Disinformation from the Associated Press and Washington Post.
[02:37:00.094 --> 02:37:02.516]  They're funding DARPA in a hundred different programs.
[02:37:02.797 --> 02:37:04.938]  They kill one program and you think it's gone.
[02:37:04.959 --> 02:37:11.524]  I mean, DARPA put hundreds of microphones up in Austin five years ago.
[02:37:11.765 --> 02:37:13.146]  That's in my film Police State 2000.
[02:37:13.326 --> 02:37:15.208]  They put the cameras up.
[02:37:15.268 --> 02:37:15.588]  In fact,
[02:37:16.676 --> 02:37:17.176]  Here's another one.
[02:37:17.196 --> 02:37:20.037]  Pentagon to dig into marketing of data on citizens.
[02:37:20.057 --> 02:37:24.919]  That's the Washington Times saying that, look, they say the TIPS program's over, they call it talent.
[02:37:25.620 --> 02:37:27.941]  You know, that's all they do to make you think everything's fine.
[02:37:28.481 --> 02:37:35.864]  A Pentagon alters LifeLog project, and the Pentagon had said that everything you do, everything you buy, everything you say will be tracked and traced.
[02:37:36.224 --> 02:37:38.645]  Well, now they say just some of it because you complained
[02:37:39.309 --> 02:37:53.515]  Got another one here where England with its three plus million surveillance cameras is going to put in the software that doesn't just face scan or license plate scan and know where you are and what you're doing all under surveillance at all times.
[02:37:55.074 --> 02:38:06.157]  In violation of the Magna Carta, now they are going to use the stuff that sees if you're walking aggressively, or it's going to scan your brainwaves and see if they're excited.
[02:38:06.397 --> 02:38:07.077]  I'm not kidding.
[02:38:07.397 --> 02:38:09.697]  Good police quote had probable cause to question you.
[02:38:10.538 --> 02:38:11.918]  This is mainstream news.
[02:38:11.938 --> 02:38:12.798]  I'm going to dig it out.
[02:38:14.159 --> 02:38:14.899]  Here's another one.
[02:38:15.339 --> 02:38:19.240]  This is a Business Wire Digital Angel Corp.
[02:38:19.860 --> 02:38:24.461]  livestock scanner installed at PM's Beef Wyndham plant.
[02:38:25.664 --> 02:38:32.630]  And, uh, the Homeland Security is pressing to make it mandatory to put chips in all cattle, all dogs, all cats.
[02:38:33.591 --> 02:38:45.902]  And, uh, again, uh, we have the secret documents now published, uh, by the, uh, ID Center with Walmart and the Defense Department of a plan for a national control grid to track everything you do with implantable microchips in all products.
[02:38:46.322 --> 02:38:48.264]  That came out two weeks ago, mainstream news.
[02:38:49.207 --> 02:38:50.409]  So we have that for you.
[02:38:50.529 --> 02:38:51.210]  Here's another one.
[02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:53.893]  Study shows kids in daycare more likely to be aggressive.
[02:38:54.313 --> 02:38:59.640]  They break up the family, make both people work, make it fashionable, so you can't raise your own children.
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:01.862]  Then they turn into little demons and get vaccinated.
[02:39:02.764 --> 02:39:05.287]  This is out of Channel 5K SLTV.
[02:39:05.627 --> 02:39:07.870]  Study shows kids in daycare more likely to be aggressive.
[02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:08.731]  A federal study shows
[02:39:09.369 --> 02:39:12.712]  The more time young children spend in daycare, the more likely they are to be overly aggressive.
[02:39:12.972 --> 02:39:20.377]  By the time they get into kindergarten, because the aggressive kids will attack them, then they fight back, then you get on Ritalin and Prozac, which is what they want to begin with.
[02:39:20.397 --> 02:39:24.400]  And so, that's the bottom.
[02:39:24.441 --> 02:39:28.804]  I mean, everybody already knew this, but the system the government has given us is to destroy society.
[02:39:30.185 --> 02:39:35.709]  Again, you are graduating from college at 15, CPS files criminal charges on your parents.
[02:39:36.290 --> 02:39:38.111]  They don't want, we have their own federal documents.
[02:39:39.165 --> 02:39:41.827]  Food scientists to assess bioterrorism risk.
[02:39:41.907 --> 02:39:48.833]  A new group formed, Reuters reports, by the biotech companies is going to tell us how safe it is.
[02:39:52.563 --> 02:39:55.344]  Korean Guard exchanged fire.
[02:39:55.724 --> 02:40:03.788]  Soldiers from North Korea and South Korea have exchanged machine gun fire as tensions rise amid efforts to resolve the crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.
[02:40:04.368 --> 02:40:08.510]  Again, the globalist announcement that they plan to invade as early as October.
[02:40:08.530 --> 02:40:12.632]  North Korea has got Pyongyang and Kim Jong-il going nuts.
[02:40:13.512 --> 02:40:16.053]  They're trying to push them on the 10-part plan to attack first.
[02:40:16.514 --> 02:40:19.615]  Out of that crisis, you'll get World War III, national draft, total control.
[02:40:21.691 --> 02:40:22.272]  And it goes on.
[02:40:22.492 --> 02:40:22.592]  U.S.
[02:40:22.632 --> 02:40:24.113]  drafts Liberian troop plan.
[02:40:24.133 --> 02:40:25.294]  There's already hundreds of troops there.
[02:40:25.334 --> 02:40:26.374]  Now they're going to send thousands.
[02:40:26.795 --> 02:40:28.216]  That'll be a nice diversion as U.S.
[02:40:28.236 --> 02:40:29.216]  troops get killed there.
[02:40:29.897 --> 02:40:31.798]  Sad for them, but it'll be a good diversion for the globalists.
[02:40:32.198 --> 02:40:34.800]  Russian nuclear subs never stop patrolling world.
[02:40:34.980 --> 02:40:37.742]  ITAR-TOS, official Russian news, reports the U.S.
[02:40:37.782 --> 02:40:41.104]  is surrounded by Chinese and Russian nuked subs.
[02:40:42.685 --> 02:40:47.208]  But the border's wide open and CPS is going after 15-year-olds as they graduate from college.
[02:40:48.436 --> 02:40:49.597]  This is from ABC News.
[02:40:49.637 --> 02:40:50.337]  Report U.S.
[02:40:50.377 --> 02:40:52.219]  may call National Guard for Iraq duty.
[02:40:52.239 --> 02:40:55.381]  More of your family getting shot and killed and Bush does bring it on.
[02:40:57.402 --> 02:41:01.625]  Bureaucrats block spot checks on safety of space shuttle and help that take place.
[02:41:01.645 --> 02:41:03.026]  Salt Lake City Tribune, no kidding.
[02:41:04.107 --> 02:41:08.150]  Smart software linked to CCTV can spot dubious behavior.
[02:41:08.190 --> 02:41:09.391]  This is the new scientist.
[02:41:10.271 --> 02:41:11.052]  They claim it's new.
[02:41:11.112 --> 02:41:11.992]  It's been out for years.
[02:41:12.032 --> 02:41:13.694]  They're announcing they're going to use it on you.
[02:41:14.514 --> 02:41:16.836]  DARPA has had Austin wired again for five years.
[02:41:18.146 --> 02:41:20.688]  They are powerful microphones.
[02:41:20.748 --> 02:41:24.372]  Some of them even have laser arrays to listen through your windows.
[02:41:25.613 --> 02:41:28.055]  Again, from where I sit, there are three cameras.
[02:41:28.355 --> 02:41:32.719]  And at my other office, there are dozens within five blocks.
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:35.081]  We'll be back with this system.
[02:41:35.101 --> 02:41:35.542]  Stay with us.
[02:41:36.497 --> 02:41:40.841]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:41.022 --> 02:41:45.446]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.586 --> 02:41:49.990]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:51.352]  The New World Order.
[02:41:53.130 --> 02:41:57.355]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:57.435 --> 02:42:04.365]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.

[02:42:07.008 --> 02:42:17.274]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[02:42:54.873 --> 02:42:57.994]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:42:58.274 --> 02:43:04.019]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[02:43:42.737 --> 02:43:49.663]  It has twice as much of the high-grade marine coral calcium from Okinawa, Japan, and almost twice as much of all other nutrients.
[02:43:49.823 --> 02:43:56.389]  Today, it's the best bang for your buck in the health nutrients industry, and coral calcium is the nutrient of the 21st century.

[02:44:00.412 --> 02:44:02.053]  Bob wants to help heal America.

[02:44:44.162 --> 02:44:45.203]  Alright, we're back live.
[02:44:45.283 --> 02:44:47.364]  I'm going through the news as quickly as possible.
[02:44:47.384 --> 02:44:51.848]  I should have done this in the first hour, but I just had so many amazing guests today.
[02:44:53.397 --> 02:44:58.381]  Smart software linked to CCTV can spot dubious behavior.
[02:44:58.421 --> 02:45:02.525]  Now, every time there's a news article, it's how new it is, how it's just in a few places.
[02:45:03.505 --> 02:45:07.829]  Almost two years ago, in five airports, they put brain scanners in, designed by NASA.
[02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:10.111]  And they quote, decide if you're guilty.
[02:45:11.452 --> 02:45:13.734]  It could be the dawn of a new era of surveillance.
[02:45:13.854 --> 02:45:18.978]  For the first time, smart software will help CCTV operators spot any abnormal behavior.
[02:45:20.021 --> 02:45:24.785]  The trial due to go live in two London Underground stations this week is a success.
[02:45:25.205 --> 02:45:34.052]  It accelerates the adoption of the technology around the world, the software which analyzes CCTV footage, it helps spot suicide attempts, overcrowding,
[02:45:35.718 --> 02:45:52.372]  Again, in suspect packages and trespassers, the hope is that by automating the predictions, see it's pre-crime, or detection of such events, security staff, who often have as much as 60 cameras to monitor, simultaneously can reach the scene in time to prevent a potential tragedy.
[02:45:52.412 --> 02:45:59.658]  So, you see, I told you Echelon, even with keyword and key stuff, with video and audio and stuff, can't track them all, they don't have the personnel.
[02:46:00.327 --> 02:46:06.250]  But this is perfect for him because they found with the face scanning cameras, everybody they went after in Tampa with it was innocent.
[02:46:06.370 --> 02:46:09.191]  Just, oh, you're a criminal, SWAT team runs up, it's the wrong person.
[02:46:09.652 --> 02:46:10.172]  They don't care.
[02:46:10.192 --> 02:46:11.372]  It's not designed to work.
[02:46:11.472 --> 02:46:20.497]  It's just, oh, the camera showed some aggression or, you know, your car was driving erratically, so we got flagged to you and the mile marker told us where you were at.
[02:46:22.051 --> 02:46:23.692]  There's behavioral oddities.
[02:46:23.812 --> 02:46:30.015]  And it goes, not long ago, similar claims were made of face recognition software, which is still to make it smart, particularly at crime prevention.
[02:46:30.035 --> 02:46:30.555]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:46:30.575 --> 02:46:31.295]  It's still everywhere.
[02:46:31.736 --> 02:46:36.578]  The computer scientist behind IPS is convinced that the software will not suffer a similar fate.
[02:46:37.728 --> 02:46:40.989]  And it sees how you walk, it scans heat off your brain.
[02:46:41.729 --> 02:46:45.330]  The government's scanning you with CAT scan cameras as you walk around.
[02:46:45.370 --> 02:46:47.890]  It's the mark of a free society.
[02:46:47.930 --> 02:46:50.391]  Just bristling, everything being scanned.
[02:46:50.971 --> 02:46:52.151]  Your heart rate, everything.
[02:46:52.271 --> 02:46:53.451]  It's all part of freedom, folks.
[02:46:53.532 --> 02:46:55.072]  And of course, I know who you are off the face scan.
[02:46:56.232 --> 02:47:00.153]  Now it's a giant grid being built by the Pentagon to control you and your family.
[02:47:01.784 --> 02:47:02.445]  Some good news.
[02:47:02.525 --> 02:47:11.131]  Judge declares roadless rule illegal, saying Bill Clinton's land grab, saying that they can take your private roads away if they border public land are illegal.
[02:47:12.112 --> 02:47:16.635]  But the problem is there's a bunch of loopholes in here you can drive Mack trucks through, but that is good news overall.
[02:47:18.156 --> 02:47:21.179]  Just a bunch of other news here that we didn't get to.
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:23.420]  You've got to visit
[02:47:25.274 --> 02:47:26.635]  Infowars.com.
[02:47:26.975 --> 02:47:34.398]  The troops are going to put on the streets of America unarmed ground vehicles that zap you and microwave you or shoot you.
[02:47:34.479 --> 02:47:37.120]  And the police, of course, will be getting them, too.
[02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:38.881]  And, of course, they'll need to use them on you.
[02:47:38.961 --> 02:47:42.122]  It's all part of freedom, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:42.142 --> 02:47:48.105]  Before I end this show, I do want to talk about how a black bear mauled a few people the other day.
[02:47:48.145 --> 02:47:49.606]  So I say ban black bears.
[02:47:50.485 --> 02:47:51.525]  They want to ban guns.
[02:47:51.605 --> 02:47:54.426]  An old man out in California drove over and killed 6-8 people.
[02:47:54.446 --> 02:47:55.166]  They're not sure yet.
[02:47:55.486 --> 02:47:57.907]  Yesterday, I say ban old folks from driving.
[02:47:57.927 --> 02:48:01.168]  I don't really mean that, but that's the answer to everything in this world now.
[02:48:02.308 --> 02:48:03.488]  Don't punish people individually.
[02:48:03.528 --> 02:48:04.228]  Punish us all.
[02:48:04.248 --> 02:48:08.329]  They're talking about Australia primed to be brought into the United States.
[02:48:08.369 --> 02:48:09.650]  That's from the News of Australia.
[02:48:10.830 --> 02:48:11.750]  I'm out of time, folks.

[02:49:32.352 --> 02:49:36.736]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:49:36.936 --> 02:49:37.497]  The Aeronizer.
