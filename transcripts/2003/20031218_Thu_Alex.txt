[00:00:05.444 --> 00:00:06.084]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.744 --> 00:00:07.785]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:09.605]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.265 --> 00:00:11.086]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:12.746]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:17.047]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:21.709]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.870]  Strap yourselves in, my friends.
[00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.451]  Another powerful broadcast lined up for you.
[00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:34.012]  It is the 18th day of December.
[00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:39.887]  2003.
[00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:39.887]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:40.527 --> 00:00:44.250]  We've only got, what, 12, 13 days left in this year.
[00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.850]  Then it'll be 04.
[00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:50.975]  Hey, there's some chemtrail news in the media today we'll be going over.
[00:00:51.095 --> 00:01:02.104]  President Bush's administration had said a few weeks ago they were going to be announcing a trip to the moon yesterday on the 100th anniversary of powered flight.
[00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:03.625]  That did not happen.
[00:01:05.276 --> 00:01:05.836]  We're good to go.
[00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:06.056]  I think?
[00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:33.445]  And I want to go over an article from yesterday.
[00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:56.005]  Feds outline plan for enemy combatants.
[00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:57.425]  This was their argument.
[00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:09.848]  And they restate that if the president or the executive branch believes that it's in the interest of the country, that is their interest, you can be secretly arrested.
[00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:16.830]  I wanted to go back over what they're trying to do, what they're trying to set up for you and your family.
[00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.691]  Mel Gibson's The Passion is scheduled to be released tomorrow.
[00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:21.412]  We're good to go.
[00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:53.921]  Through the ADL and others, because the current pope has been a big supporter of those organizations, and their demonization of Mel Gibson is backfiring, even with leftists that screened the film a few weeks ago here in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:58.984]  So some more on the passion, which I can't wait to see.
[00:02:59.904 --> 00:03:02.566]  The 9-11 chairman attack was preventable.
[00:03:02.586 --> 00:03:03.847]  Ooh, interesting statement.
[00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:08.579]  Also, Saddam's arrest fuels new insurgency.
[00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.682]  Chinese megabucks for Bush brothers might tell us why.
[00:03:14.482 --> 00:03:16.643]  Bush has cut Taiwan loose.
[00:03:17.123 --> 00:03:21.185]  Also, Bush said yesterday that Saddam should die.
[00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:23.106]  We'll go over that.
[00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:24.827]  And here's the chemtrail news.
[00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:26.108]  Earth is 20% darker, says experts.
[00:03:29.344 --> 00:03:30.605]  Clouds are forming.
[00:03:30.685 --> 00:03:31.525]  Well, no kidding.
[00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.506]  What do you see the chemtrails doing?
[00:03:33.966 --> 00:03:38.328]  We'll go over that and all the evidence of MI6 murdering Princess Diana.
[00:03:38.748 --> 00:03:44.931]  Now they're going to have a whitewash commission investigation on that.
[00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.552]  And they're saying brace for more terrorism.
[00:03:47.732 --> 00:03:47.852]  U.S.
[00:03:47.912 --> 00:03:50.293]  urges citizens to leave Saudi Arabia.
[00:03:50.373 --> 00:03:51.353]  Blair, U.S.
[00:03:51.393 --> 00:03:52.974]  has found secret Iraq labs.
[00:03:54.352 --> 00:03:57.634]  So now they've supposedly maybe found the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:05.460]  And I want to go back over terror alerts manufactured to show how these people are congenital liars.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.162]  So, big show lined up for you.
[00:04:09.222 --> 00:04:11.444]  We'll dive straight into the news I just mentioned.
[00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:15.572]  Then we'll go to your calls early in this hour.
[00:04:15.712 --> 00:04:21.853]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:22.373 --> 00:04:25.054]  And the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:25.074 --> 00:04:25.294]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:25.314 --> 00:04:25.474]  Just
[00:04:38.097 --> 00:04:41.680]  It's a shotgun approach of key news and information to get you thinking out there.
[00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:48.307]  When we get back, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:49.108 --> 00:04:55.133]  So please stay with us, and we'll see you on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:57.496]  As I said, strap yourselves in.
[00:05:01.796 --> 00:05:09.180]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:14.183]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.404 --> 00:05:20.047]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:24.829]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:32.191]  The casual society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.211 --> 00:05:36.753]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.913 --> 00:05:39.454]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:39.654 --> 00:05:46.356]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:46.916]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:06.527]  Oh my... I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:06:06.687 --> 00:06:07.287]  Yes, it's true.
[00:06:07.307 --> 00:06:10.070]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.194]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:14.854]  You heard it right.
[00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:19.979]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:21.100]  The list goes on and on.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.161]  You may miss out forever.
[00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:38.535]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:11.318]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:19.064]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:19.324 --> 00:07:20.085]  We're good to go.
[00:07:35.294 --> 00:07:39.176]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:07:39.236 --> 00:07:41.157]  The water level is always visible.
[00:07:41.297 --> 00:07:47.241]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:51.743]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:52.224]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:07.440]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.446 --> 00:08:22.992]  Every day, there are new listeners, tens of thousands of new listeners to this broadcast.
[00:08:23.032 --> 00:08:29.237]  You're tuning in because friends or family or neighbors told you you needed to hear the information that we covered.
[00:08:30.049 --> 00:08:31.890]  You're wondering, what is this show about?
[00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:40.697]  Well, it's about human history and then looking at the systems of power that surround us and guide the events of our daily lives.
[00:08:41.618 --> 00:08:43.559]  The show is not about Michael Jackson.
[00:08:43.819 --> 00:08:46.521]  It's not about Hollywood stars.
[00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:51.845]  It's not about, well, you know, sex, drugs, and rock and roll.
[00:08:51.945 --> 00:08:55.708]  It's about issues that actually affect you and your family.
[00:08:57.043 --> 00:09:11.250]  If you study world history from any culture in any time in the last 6,000 years of civilization, you will see a common thread of oppressors setting themselves up as kings and feeding on their populations.
[00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:18.573]  And the longer an elite is in power, the more decadent and sadistic and abusive they become.
[00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:25.056]  It is the nature of power that it corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:09:27.444 --> 00:09:28.205]  We're good to go.
[00:09:48.024 --> 00:10:12.936]  And they communicate with each other in white papers and different think tank treatises that openly talk about dumbing you down, getting you in compact cities, taking your private property, destroying the family, confiscating your firearms, getting rid of national sovereignty, eliminating juries, surveilling your every move, controlling you through a national ID card.
[00:10:14.377 --> 00:10:16.598]  Now, I've been on the air coming up on 10 years,
[00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.974]  Ten years fighting the New World Order.
[00:10:21.775 --> 00:10:26.642]  And a lot of people, a lot of listeners have been out there fighting it a lot longer than I have.
[00:10:27.923 --> 00:10:30.426]  And I have plumbed the depths of the New World Order.
[00:10:30.527 --> 00:10:33.891]  I have a great understanding of it and their programs.
[00:10:34.784 --> 00:10:52.169]  And I know that we can defeat it, or at least set it back, that we have set it back, that more people are aware of the criminal syndicate than ever before, but there's amazing apathy even with those that are aware of the true spectrum and the true system.
[00:10:53.030 --> 00:11:06.615]  It is my job, it is your job, to awaken that innate human spark that loves liberty and decency and honor and that God guide us in our fights against tyranny wherever we find it.
[00:11:07.735 --> 00:11:09.356]  Be part of history.
[00:11:10.576 --> 00:11:15.298]  The bumper sticker that reads, the man who dies with the most toys wins, is a fraud.
[00:11:15.982 --> 00:11:40.415]  The man who dies, who has uplifted humanity, who has taken care of his or her children, the person that dies who has invented technologies and who has brought forward ideas of goodness, the person that builds civilization wins.
[00:11:40.855 --> 00:11:48.621]  The person who promotes creativity and freedom and decency and honor and family wins.
[00:11:50.642 --> 00:11:52.163]  And the globalists understand this.
[00:11:52.183 --> 00:11:53.284]  They're all about control.
[00:11:53.304 --> 00:11:57.707]  They're all about knocking out the spark of creativity, controlling it, dumbing us down.
[00:11:58.573 --> 00:11:59.293]  We're good to go.
[00:11:59.373 --> 00:11:59.654]  I think?
[00:12:23.934 --> 00:12:27.916]  And this show, this broadcast, is about exposing that.
[00:12:28.056 --> 00:12:40.221]  Now, somehow they've trained the population that corruption in government doesn't exist, or if it does, that it's a necessary evil and that they have the authority and that we are not to question that.
[00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:41.488]  We're good to go.
[00:13:01.716 --> 00:13:12.844]  And so you need to ask yourself why that has been drummed into you, why that has been the overriding mindset that has been crafted into the group psyche.
[00:13:15.306 --> 00:13:30.357]  Because if people don't know their Bill of Rights, if people don't know what tyranny is from studying history and modern nations and dictators and oligarchies, then when tyranny is upon them, when despotism is grinding its steel boot into your face...
[00:13:31.158 --> 00:13:35.085]  And telling you that it's liberty, some of you are buying it.
[00:13:35.727 --> 00:13:41.257]  Or at least deciding that, well, that's just the nature of the world and that you've got to accept it.
[00:13:41.952 --> 00:13:45.374]  And the truth is, you don't have to accept it.
[00:13:45.694 --> 00:13:47.895]  You shouldn't accept it.
[00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:51.037]  You shouldn't go along with it.
[00:13:51.077 --> 00:14:05.164]  You should be truly alive and at the end of your life know that you made a difference on the side of goodness, on the side of light against the darkness that is growing and spilling out.
[00:14:05.524 --> 00:14:13.767]  The dams of wickedness, the depths of Hades have been released upon us.
[00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:20.790]  Hundreds of millions of abortions worldwide, 50 million in this country.
[00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.691]  That's the dams of evil being broken.
[00:14:24.732 --> 00:14:28.133]  The gates of hell being flung wide open.
[00:14:29.394 --> 00:14:32.335]  And we have allowed this to happen because we have become wicked and decadent.
[00:14:33.334 --> 00:14:43.016]  Genetic engineering, mass cloning of embryos, now reaching the level of an assembly line industry.
[00:14:43.276 --> 00:14:44.277]  That is evil.
[00:14:44.777 --> 00:14:53.619]  Taking plant and animal and of course insect genes and mammal genes and putting them into strawberries and bananas.
[00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:55.239]  We're good to go.
[00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.091]  Governments slaughtering third world populations.
[00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:34.333]  Governments with globalist and IMF World Bank funding putting sterilization hormones into tetanus shots worldwide.
[00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:36.133]  That is evil.
[00:15:36.454 --> 00:15:41.995]  Our troops breathing depleted uranium and our government now twice in Iraq and once in Iran.
[00:15:42.815 --> 00:15:52.897]  Of course, Serbia and now in Afghanistan, spraying the battlefield in ancient cities with depleted uranium and admitted deadly carcinogen.
[00:15:53.197 --> 00:15:55.057]  That is insane evil.
[00:15:56.057 --> 00:16:03.179]  The FBI running murder-for-hire and drugs and prostitutes from Boston to Los Angeles, that is evil.
[00:16:04.099 --> 00:16:07.539]  The Houston Crime Lab framing thousands, that's evil.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.360]  The Dallas Police Department planting chalk
[00:16:11.014 --> 00:16:20.262]  On people who never dealt drugs or tried to deal drugs, just randomly arresting people and putting them in prison for life, making up convictions, that's evil.
[00:16:21.423 --> 00:16:35.235]  And there are hundreds and hundreds of examples of systematic, industrial-level, formalized, institutionalized, total and complete despotism.
[00:16:38.087 --> 00:16:44.750]  I could go on for hours listening to their out-of-control crimes, nerve-gassing thousands of U.S.
[00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:51.453]  and British troops up until 1985 that have them stand out in a field in England or in Wales, fly over them, spray them.
[00:16:51.493 --> 00:16:54.055]  Some would die on the spot some weeks later.
[00:16:54.375 --> 00:16:55.976]  Others in wheelchairs to this day.
[00:16:56.296 --> 00:17:00.418]  BBC calmly announces, yeah, we nerve-gassed them.
[00:17:00.438 --> 00:17:02.319]  We're not going to charge any of the troops that did it.
[00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:04.560]  They were just following orders under a U.S.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.041]  government program called Shed.
[00:17:08.149 --> 00:17:09.070]  That's evil.
[00:17:09.931 --> 00:17:14.715]  You have an FBI crime lab caught framing people, falsifying DNA.
[00:17:15.196 --> 00:17:16.277]  That's evil.
[00:17:17.378 --> 00:17:23.884]  You have the Dallas Police Department certifying the chalk that they planted on innocent people as real cocaine.
[00:17:24.165 --> 00:17:25.986]  The district attorney going along with it.
[00:17:26.247 --> 00:17:27.928]  The FBI going along with it.
[00:17:28.148 --> 00:17:30.551]  Are you starting to get an idea?
[00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:41.039]  Of what we're facing and how being naive and going along with it or just accepting it will destroy you and your family.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:57.694]  This is a climate that none of us can be free in or even survive in, and the corruption paradigm or signature is expanding a geometric that is doubling in each phase growth in size.
[00:17:58.507 --> 00:18:01.870]  The global tyranny is out of its embryonic stage.
[00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.711]  It has been born.
[00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:05.512]  It has been loosed.
[00:18:05.612 --> 00:18:13.238]  It is now on two feet toddling about, feeding on populations.
[00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:24.026]  It will soon be a towering Cyclopsian wickedness, a thousand feet tall, rending the sheep-like population.
[00:18:26.207 --> 00:18:28.769]  My friends, it is upon us.
[00:18:29.729 --> 00:18:31.771]  It is upon us.
[00:18:32.331 --> 00:18:45.420]  The first waves of this black storm have smashed in for what is left of Christendom, what is left of Western civilization.
[00:18:47.742 --> 00:19:15.721]  And I beg of you to think for yourselves, to break your conditioning, to fire up your internal combustion systems, to stoke the furnaces of liberty in your heart, in your soul, in your mind, that a fire will burn and will grow and will spread to counter the wicked activities of the dehumanizing slave master syndicate of parasites.
[00:19:16.181 --> 00:19:21.022]  Bleeding the very soul out of humanity.
[00:19:22.842 --> 00:19:26.343]  When we get back, Bush overruled on enemy combatant case.
[00:19:26.403 --> 00:19:27.023]  Great news.
[00:19:27.443 --> 00:19:29.143]  We'll go back over what the enemy combatant is.
[00:19:29.163 --> 00:19:30.724]  9-11 whitewasher.
[00:19:31.164 --> 00:19:32.344]  Attack was preventable.
[00:19:33.624 --> 00:19:33.844]  U.S.
[00:19:33.924 --> 00:19:36.625]  urges citizens to leave Saudi Arabia.
[00:19:38.605 --> 00:19:41.206]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:42.286]  Bush being paid off.
[00:19:43.246 --> 00:19:46.349]  With cash by the communist Chinese to sell out Taiwan.
[00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.131]  Out Clinton in Clinton.
[00:19:48.151 --> 00:19:53.116]  The neocons desperately trying to keep the truth from the conservative mass out there.
[00:19:53.136 --> 00:19:57.480]  To placate you so they can finally decapitate liberty.
[00:19:58.261 --> 00:19:59.302]  We're not going to let it happen.
[00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:08.458]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:20:08.678 --> 00:20:10.941]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:20:11.142 --> 00:20:17.491]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver, 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:18.474]  We're good to go.
[00:20:40.436 --> 00:20:41.276]  We're good to go.
[00:20:41.356 --> 00:20:41.596]  I think?
[00:21:00.146 --> 00:21:03.649]  If the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:26.966 --> 00:21:28.146]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237
[00:21:56.051 --> 00:21:56.311]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:23.975 --> 00:22:25.536]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:22:25.576 --> 00:22:26.296]  Toxic fumes.
[00:22:26.316 --> 00:22:27.736]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[00:22:28.176 --> 00:22:30.757]  They go into you, into your children.
[00:22:30.817 --> 00:22:31.357]  Their lungs.
[00:22:31.437 --> 00:22:32.218]  Am I scaring you?
[00:22:32.538 --> 00:22:33.438]  Remember this word.
[00:22:33.838 --> 00:22:34.578]  Puritech.
[00:22:34.618 --> 00:22:36.139]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[00:22:36.199 --> 00:22:38.379]  Puritech makes the pure air system.
[00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:51.103]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:52.464]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[00:22:52.484 --> 00:22:52.504]  888-49
[00:22:53.564 --> 00:22:54.405]  We're good to go.
[00:23:18.024 --> 00:23:21.785]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:23:46.869 --> 00:23:54.093]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:23:54.253 --> 00:23:58.395]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:23:58.555 --> 00:24:06.860]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.961]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:13.963 --> 00:24:15.084]  Hey, I'll tell you what we'll do.
[00:24:15.976 --> 00:24:17.577]  We'll go ahead and go to some calls now.
[00:24:17.597 --> 00:24:22.540]  Then coming up before this hour ends, I'll get into the enemy combatant ruling, which is a good thing.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:31.145]  But I would expect Bush to ignore the Second Court of Appeals, a circuit court, saying no to grabbing citizens and them never being seen again.
[00:24:32.225 --> 00:24:35.807]  Also, they're talking about more terrorist attacks and telling U.S.
[00:24:35.847 --> 00:24:41.731]  citizens to get out of Iraq, to get out of Saudi Arabia, to get out of a couple other different countries.
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.102]  And there's just a bunch of other key news items that are coming up.
[00:24:45.163 --> 00:24:49.767]  And we have George Humphrey joining us in the next hour, expert on the New World Order.
[00:24:50.207 --> 00:24:51.549]  Let's go to calls right now.
[00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:53.791]  Mike in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:24:53.811 --> 00:24:54.211]  Go ahead.
[00:24:55.412 --> 00:24:55.913]  Hey, Alex.
[00:24:56.153 --> 00:24:57.815]  I was actually calling you from Fort Collins.
[00:24:57.915 --> 00:24:58.855]  I used to live in Austin.
[00:24:58.876 --> 00:25:03.180]  But the reason I was calling is I've had some questions about these chemtrails for a while.
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.080]  I mean, I look around.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.643]  I'm on my way back from Denver International Airport right now.
[00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:13.095]  And it's so insane and sick out here that it's literally a layer of fog that's canvassed the whole entire area.
[00:25:13.495 --> 00:25:18.416]  I've called Denver City Council, Fort Collins City Council, the EPA.
[00:25:18.496 --> 00:25:20.717]  No one will take my calls or return my calls.
[00:25:21.277 --> 00:25:25.999]  And I'm just wondering if this isn't some form of dumbing us down like other things that you refer to.
[00:25:26.019 --> 00:25:26.419]  Okay.
[00:25:26.579 --> 00:25:28.439]  And I'll hang up and listen.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.620]  I normally only cover things we can prove and demonstrate.
[00:25:32.081 --> 00:25:36.322]  That is bills, legislation, statements, things that have happened, government documents.
[00:25:36.422 --> 00:25:36.682]  But...
[00:25:37.515 --> 00:25:37.956]  I know this.
[00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:48.871]  Five, six years ago, jets would lay trails down for my entire life at 25, 30,000 feet, and the trail would disappear within a minute or two maximum.
[00:25:49.812 --> 00:25:53.558]  Six years ago, jets began laying trails at 4,000 feet.
[00:25:55.308 --> 00:26:08.038]  That jets right beside it weren't leaving trails, and the thing they sprayed out would stay there four or five hours, and so many trails they would merge into low-level cloud cover.
[00:26:08.098 --> 00:26:14.243]  Every time there's a front of rain coming in, a bunch of jets get up there and spray lines in front of it.
[00:26:14.744 --> 00:26:15.584]  It stops it.
[00:26:16.105 --> 00:26:22.510]  I have dozens of major reports by top scientists saying that the Earth is getting darker,
[00:26:23.756 --> 00:26:28.480]  Something is happening, and all I know is there is something to it.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.541]  They've done tests of it.
[00:26:30.646 --> 00:26:32.087]  They found barium salts.
[00:26:32.868 --> 00:26:41.355]  They found like a spider web, a plastic type of filament with a flu virus in the past with white blood cells without nucleus.
[00:26:42.336 --> 00:26:44.338]  This has been going on for a long time.
[00:26:44.378 --> 00:26:45.119]  They've done tests.
[00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:47.621]  We've had helicopters spraying us here in Austin.
[00:26:47.861 --> 00:26:49.483]  That's even been on the national news.
[00:26:49.563 --> 00:26:50.604]  Everybody gets sick.
[00:26:51.464 --> 00:26:52.806]  So this has been going on.
[00:26:53.506 --> 00:26:55.208]  This is out of the London Guardian today.
[00:26:55.328 --> 00:26:56.028]  Earth is 20% darker, say experts.
[00:26:58.612 --> 00:26:58.972]  We're good to go.
[00:27:25.604 --> 00:27:33.690]  Radiance at the Earth's surface has decreased, said Jim Hansen, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Science in New York.
[00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:42.155]  Experts say global dimming is probably down to tiny particles such as soot and chemical compounds such as sulfates accumulating in the atmosphere.
[00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:50.280]  Data from 100 stations around the world show that the amount of black carbon in the atmosphere is twice as big as we assume, said Dr. Hansen.
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.200]  Hanson.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.621]  Well, actually, I've looked at the numbers.
[00:27:53.641 --> 00:27:58.322]  30, 40 years ago, we had more soot in the air because they didn't have scrubbers at the power plants.
[00:27:58.642 --> 00:28:04.024]  I remember as a child seeing the haze around Dallas and Houston and San Antonio when you drive into the cities.
[00:28:04.064 --> 00:28:05.344]  That's not there now.
[00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:06.585]  Things are much clearer.
[00:28:06.605 --> 00:28:10.146]  I remember getting a headache stuck in traffic as a young man or a child.
[00:28:10.646 --> 00:28:12.686]  Now with the catalytic converters, that isn't the case.
[00:28:12.886 --> 00:28:14.767]  They emit actual pollutions way down.
[00:28:15.147 --> 00:28:17.908]  So where is all these new particles coming from?
[00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:19.469]  I've seen them.
[00:28:19.649 --> 00:28:21.570]  They're spraying something.
[00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:26.772]  Trails don't sit there for four hours and then start misting into clouds.
[00:28:26.812 --> 00:28:27.332]  Go ahead.
[00:28:30.014 --> 00:28:31.314]  His phone cut out, I'm told.
[00:28:32.355 --> 00:28:35.176]  Okay, well, I hope that answers your question, Mike.
[00:28:36.503 --> 00:28:38.643]  And something is going on.
[00:28:39.144 --> 00:28:39.524]  Okay?
[00:28:39.564 --> 00:28:41.244]  Something is happening.
[00:28:41.664 --> 00:28:44.365]  Because now they're at 3,000, 4,000 feet.
[00:28:44.965 --> 00:28:46.805]  I'm eight miles from the airport.
[00:28:47.205 --> 00:28:49.366]  And they fly in at a couple thousand feet.
[00:28:49.406 --> 00:28:51.066]  It'll be a clear blue sky in the morning.
[00:28:51.366 --> 00:28:56.367]  And by noon, it will be solid stripes from one end of the horizon to the other.
[00:28:56.587 --> 00:28:58.088]  Within hours, they merge.
[00:28:58.248 --> 00:28:59.468]  And it will be dark.
[00:28:59.508 --> 00:29:04.009]  You know, like a dark, rainy day with no rain by 4 o'clock.
[00:29:04.781 --> 00:29:10.262]  And this goes on 50, 60, sometimes 100 days a year, right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:29:10.322 --> 00:29:11.703]  And I've been all over the country.
[00:29:12.423 --> 00:29:18.564]  And again, folks, you'll see a jet flying by one jet, and its trail's going out at 30,000 feet, disappearing behind it.
[00:29:18.844 --> 00:29:26.546]  And a jet a mile away from it at the same altitude, a huge spray 10 times as wide, and it'll sit there and be there in three hours.
[00:29:27.978 --> 00:29:32.322]  And start drifting downwards with weird-looking, tentacle-like clouds.
[00:29:32.402 --> 00:29:35.724]  And there's just millions of photos on the web of this stuff.
[00:29:36.084 --> 00:29:37.946]  It's just absolutely insane.
[00:29:38.707 --> 00:29:43.911]  Some of the most incredible photos I've seen from around here in Austin are at intel123.com.
[00:29:45.152 --> 00:29:49.255]  All right, we'll be back, folks, and we'll go to more of your calls and more news.
[00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:52.257]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.758 --> 00:29:54.259]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.261 --> 00:29:57.980]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.636 --> 00:30:05.177]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:30:05.517 --> 00:30:05.838]  Yes.
[00:30:06.118 --> 00:30:10.920]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:19.983]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[00:30:20.123 --> 00:30:27.826]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[00:30:28.046 --> 00:30:30.247]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[00:30:30.467 --> 00:30:32.347]  Go to AustinWheatgrass.com or call toll-free 1-877-MY-WHEAT.
[00:30:32.367 --> 00:30:34.568]  And thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[00:31:00.836 --> 00:31:01.396]  We're good to go.
[00:31:26.836 --> 00:31:28.758]  You'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[00:32:01.021 --> 00:32:01.521]  Hey, everybody.
[00:32:01.561 --> 00:32:03.322]  Let me talk to you about your weight for a minute.
[00:32:03.402 --> 00:32:05.983]  How many of you have tried the fad diets?
[00:32:06.163 --> 00:32:07.304]  You've tried the pills.
[00:32:07.324 --> 00:32:08.765]  You've tried counting calories.
[00:32:08.985 --> 00:32:13.247]  You've even tried other nighttime weight loss formulas, and nothing seems to be working.
[00:32:13.527 --> 00:32:14.507]  You know what I suggest to you?
[00:32:14.907 --> 00:32:20.570]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:29.294]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN, and they have people standing by to answer your questions about how to lose weight the safe and healthy way.
[00:32:29.794 --> 00:32:31.375]  No ephedra, no stimulants.
[00:32:31.415 --> 00:32:37.258]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:32:37.338 --> 00:32:38.599]  This is the real deal, folks.
[00:32:38.659 --> 00:32:41.280]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.420]  And it's healthy for you, too.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:49.184]  In addition to helping you lose weight, Collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair, and nails.
[00:32:49.344 --> 00:32:51.325]  So take Collagenate and rejuvenate.
[00:32:51.405 --> 00:32:52.425]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:32:52.445 --> 00:32:52.686]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:32:52.706 --> 00:32:52.906]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:33:12.468 --> 00:33:22.016]  I know that President Bush gave a speech yesterday outdoors about the 100th year of powered flight.
[00:33:24.118 --> 00:33:32.926]  They say powered flight because they had gliders going back 100 years before that, and of course for several hundred years before that, hot air balloons pioneered by the Italians and the French.
[00:33:34.989 --> 00:33:39.150]  But you couldn't understand a word Bush said because all the jets flying around overhead.
[00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:42.912]  His staff didn't think that one out very well.
[00:33:42.952 --> 00:33:54.336]  But Bush was scheduled yesterday to announce another lunar mission to the old moon, something that hadn't happened in, what, 30 years, 30-plus years.
[00:33:55.756 --> 00:33:57.357]  They've sent probes and other things.
[00:33:57.377 --> 00:33:59.837]  Then we'll get into the whole argument of, did we go to the moon?
[00:33:59.857 --> 00:34:01.498]  Well, I know they've got advanced technology.
[00:34:02.532 --> 00:34:11.779]  But I have seen the photographs released by the government where you'll have the little distance markers on the lens of the camera and part of the marker will be behind the astronaut.
[00:34:11.819 --> 00:34:12.960]  Well, that's impossible.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.681]  You understand what I'm saying?
[00:34:14.701 --> 00:34:17.864]  You know how on a camera they'll have a little X or target mark in the middle?
[00:34:18.244 --> 00:34:24.729]  How do you have a photo where the astronaut is partially in front of something that's on the lens?
[00:34:25.837 --> 00:34:26.257]  We're good to go.
[00:34:26.277 --> 00:34:26.437]  I think?
[00:34:48.035 --> 00:34:48.556]  We're good to go.
[00:35:02.545 --> 00:35:06.726]  In 1959, developed in 1955, they say that's the fastest plane in the world.
[00:35:07.287 --> 00:35:07.987]  I don't buy it.
[00:35:08.067 --> 00:35:13.708]  There's a lot of advanced technology they've been suppressing, so why would they stage a moon mission?
[00:35:13.949 --> 00:35:14.749]  And now I've done it.
[00:35:14.789 --> 00:35:21.611]  I've started the whole discussion of this, but we already had callers, I'm told, calling in on this subject.
[00:35:21.651 --> 00:35:28.953]  But what I do know, and it's what Mike just mentioned, a caller from Colorado just mentioned,
[00:35:30.774 --> 00:35:38.101]  What I do know is that five, six years ago, I had never seen a condensation trail from a jet that didn't disappear in a couple minutes.
[00:35:38.221 --> 00:35:41.464]  Usually they disappeared as fast as the jet laid them down.
[00:35:41.744 --> 00:35:44.286]  And they were always at above 20,000 feet.
[00:35:44.346 --> 00:35:47.029]  That's where the ice crystals supposedly are able to form.
[00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.373]  Off the condensation disturbance from wingtips and the nose of the plane.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:54.996]  Now planes in the middle of the summer...
[00:35:55.703 --> 00:35:56.263]  We're good to go.
[00:35:56.284 --> 00:35:56.644]  We're good to go.
[00:36:27.048 --> 00:36:30.771]  So I know something's going on there because I've observed the change.
[00:36:32.292 --> 00:36:46.004]  And I do have several mainstream media reports from Minnesota, from Florida, where local news has done reports, where the Navy and NASA and the Air Force admit that, oh, we're doing some tests, but we won't tell you what those tests are.
[00:36:46.324 --> 00:36:49.967]  I do have some articles where they admit chemtrailing, but it's few and far between.
[00:36:51.314 --> 00:36:54.916]  So I guess we can have a big discussion about chemtrails if you want.
[00:36:55.477 --> 00:36:57.498]  Let's go to Emmett in Pennsylvania.
[00:36:57.538 --> 00:36:58.178]  You're on the air.
[00:36:58.238 --> 00:36:58.658]  Go ahead.
[00:36:59.419 --> 00:37:00.139]  Yes, Alex.
[00:37:00.319 --> 00:37:04.902]  I own a Pioneer LaserDisc of the original Moonwalk.
[00:37:05.903 --> 00:37:14.088]  And as Bill Cooper contended, you can see a cable, a black wire cable running along the ground or the floor.
[00:37:14.908 --> 00:37:20.812]  And Bill Cooper said that actually the Lunar Walk was filmed in a Disney studio in Florida.
[00:37:22.563 --> 00:37:24.464]  Are we being bamboozled again?
[00:37:25.124 --> 00:37:35.469]  Well, they claim that a man who staged another moon landing in 2001's Space Odyssey in the mid-60s, they claim Stanley Kubrick.
[00:37:36.581 --> 00:38:00.898]  had done that, and they claimed that Stanley Kubrick, among other things, making Eyes Wide Shut, was about to weigh in on what he had done, because they supposedly used Kubrick because he'd already done a successful staging that you couldn't tell was fake, but that they admitted was a representation in 2001's Space Odyssey, his movie making of Arthur C. Clarke's book.
[00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:17.400]  And so, again, these are things we can't prove one way or another, but I've seen official NASA photos that they've released where the hash marks on the camera lens, the distance gauge of the lens, is partially obscured by the astronaut.
[00:38:18.084 --> 00:38:34.300]  Now, folks, that'd be like if you took a photo with your camera, you know, that has a little X in the middle of the screen of the viewfinder, and then suddenly your dog or your husband or your wife or whatever you were taking a picture of was partially obscuring that hash mark.
[00:38:35.181 --> 00:38:42.351]  That'd be like if you took a photo through your deer rifle scope of a deer, and the deer was in front of the crosshairs.
[00:38:42.872 --> 00:38:45.416]  To try to give folks an analogy, I have seen that.
[00:38:45.976 --> 00:38:47.559]  I have seen the flag flapping.
[00:38:47.639 --> 00:38:48.840]  I have seen those stars.
[00:38:49.662 --> 00:38:51.825]  I have seen the shadows going in different directions.
[00:38:52.686 --> 00:38:54.608]  But again, it's kind of a black hole.
[00:38:55.129 --> 00:38:57.272]  I can prove DynCorp kidnaps children.
[00:38:57.772 --> 00:39:00.255]  I can prove they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:39:00.576 --> 00:39:04.641]  I can read Prince Philip's statement where he wants to kill 80% of us, or Ted Turner's.
[00:39:05.442 --> 00:39:05.882]  I can...
[00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.512]  Read where the Supreme Court says they want to go under U.N.
[00:39:09.552 --> 00:39:10.053]  control.
[00:39:10.553 --> 00:39:20.261]  I can read the documents on a Pan-American Union and the Amero notes, but I can't prove the moon stuff, and I don't know.
[00:39:20.281 --> 00:39:27.307]  Well, could it be that they had to recreate it in the studio because the lighting would be so poor on the moon?
[00:39:27.627 --> 00:39:32.331]  And look the way the astronauts bounced around there where there's no gravity.
[00:39:33.607 --> 00:39:38.411]  And they supposedly had a fan blowing the flag.
[00:39:38.691 --> 00:39:42.534]  Well, there is gravity on the moon, sir.
[00:39:42.955 --> 00:39:43.615]  Oh, okay.
[00:39:43.735 --> 00:39:48.679]  It's about one-third, I believe, or a little under one-third, what Earth's gravity is.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:49.480]  Okay.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.642]  Well, thank you very much for taking my call.
[00:39:51.682 --> 00:39:52.042]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:52.062 --> 00:39:52.963]  I appreciate the call.
[00:39:53.503 --> 00:39:55.185]  And what you said is very interesting.
[00:39:56.546 --> 00:40:02.471]  I've got a friend who was in Air Force Intelligence in the 60s, and then when he got out of the military...
[00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:12.671]  He joined NASA, and I really can't say a lot about what he told me, but he's worked with me.
[00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:15.800]  He's got the evidence.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:34.066]  All he would say was, because he was involved with the RCA video cameras in later missions, he was involved with the film cameras, and he said that what went around on the floor of NASA was, for all the engineers, and he's an electrical engineer,
[00:40:35.262 --> 00:40:51.282]  Is that they had to stage photos because the Van Allen radiation belt fries all film, and he said he saw canister after canister of film that had giant purple and green and red lines through it.
[00:40:51.562 --> 00:40:53.605]  You ever seen overexposed film or...
[00:40:54.065 --> 00:40:58.528]  You know, you got some lighting in the closet when you're, you know, taking the film out of the camera.
[00:40:59.088 --> 00:41:04.131]  That exact thing from the radiation, spots and stripes, was all over the film.
[00:41:04.732 --> 00:41:06.993]  And so that's why they staged it.
[00:41:07.754 --> 00:41:10.355]  So I have that from inside NASA.
[00:41:11.216 --> 00:41:18.700]  And frankly, on issues like that and issues like somebody in the Bush administration telling me that a year, almost two years ago, in August of 2002...
[00:41:21.317 --> 00:41:23.819]  But again, I don't like to cover it here on air because it's speculation.
[00:41:48.388 --> 00:41:50.269]  Let's talk to Alan in Colorado.
[00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.130]  Alan, you're on the air.
[00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:51.550]  Go ahead.
[00:41:51.730 --> 00:42:12.104]  Yes, Alex, I understand that within the last 48 hours, you have told the people that on Saturday, while the alleged Hussein double was being captured, that the Congress passed into law secretly the Patriot II and was signed by Bush.
[00:42:12.144 --> 00:42:13.105]  Can you confirm this, sir?
[00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:17.331]  Yes, and people keep bringing this up, and rightfully so.
[00:42:17.391 --> 00:42:18.591]  I'm glad you're concerned.
[00:42:19.471 --> 00:42:35.475]  And Ron Paul said that it is the Patriot Act II, enacted by stealth, signed Saturday, quietly, with no ceremony, announced Sunday in the midst of the supposed Saddam capture, and that is correct.
[00:42:35.715 --> 00:42:38.476]  Are you going to post this on your website, sir?
[00:42:38.496 --> 00:42:44.358]  I understand your webmaster is on vacation right now, and this is something I believe needs to be put out to the people.
[00:42:44.378 --> 00:42:46.558]  What do you mean you understand my webmaster is on vacation?
[00:42:46.658 --> 00:42:50.320]  I was told by somebody else that your webmaster was on vacation, sir.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:51.920]  It's updated right now.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.621]  It was on there three days ago.
[00:42:53.641 --> 00:42:55.721]  Would it be in the archives?
[00:42:55.821 --> 00:42:57.682]  I cannot find it on the front page, sir.
[00:42:58.042 --> 00:42:58.962]  Okay.
[00:42:59.723 --> 00:43:01.043]  It is the headline...
[00:43:02.904 --> 00:43:17.855]  On prisonplanet.com, on the left-hand side, Alan, there is a calendar.
[00:43:18.816 --> 00:43:20.497]  And it wasn't yesterday.
[00:43:20.537 --> 00:43:21.878]  It was the day before.
[00:43:21.998 --> 00:43:22.999]  So that will be the 16th.
[00:43:23.199 --> 00:43:24.340]  Tuesday.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:24.780]  Tuesday.
[00:43:25.809 --> 00:43:26.109]  Yes.
[00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:26.870]  Okay.
[00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:31.954]  That's when it's posted, and it's the very top story at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:32.014 --> 00:43:38.439]  It also was posted on InfoWars, but I don't particularly know where that is because I don't have a computer.
[00:43:38.459 --> 00:43:43.723]  Okay, so I can go to PrisonPlanet.com, click on the 16th, and pull up that information, sir.
[00:43:43.943 --> 00:43:44.483]  Yes, you can.
[00:43:44.563 --> 00:43:45.984]  Thank you very much for your time, sir.
[00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:46.845]  Hey, you bet.
[00:43:47.065 --> 00:43:49.087]  And I've got the article here in front of me.
[00:43:49.127 --> 00:43:50.608]  I read it again yesterday on air.
[00:43:52.016 --> 00:43:53.597]  And again, a little fanfare.
[00:43:54.337 --> 00:43:56.138]  The globalists have a great tactic.
[00:43:58.179 --> 00:44:11.264]  They kill Kennedy, they put out their official story, blanket the news, everybody hears it, and then it takes us 30, 40 years to expose the truth, and now 92% of the American people say the government killed Kennedy in major polls.
[00:44:12.307 --> 00:44:15.549]  I looked at dozens of them a month ago on the 40th anniversary.
[00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:19.472]  Dozens of polls, and they were all 85 to 96, 7%.
[00:44:21.133 --> 00:44:26.637]  And I actually sat there with a calculator for an hour, calculated over a dozen different polls.
[00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:32.321]  A local KXAN-TV poll, a New York Times poll, a USA Today poll, a CNN poll.
[00:44:32.441 --> 00:44:35.944]  I just averaged a bunch of these polls together, but they were all above 85%.
[00:44:35.984 --> 00:44:38.105]  And they averaged up to 92%.
[00:44:41.065 --> 00:44:44.528]  It's the same thing with Patriot Act 2 or Patriot Act 1.
[00:44:44.968 --> 00:44:49.371]  It took us a year before Patriot Act 1 got in the news.
[00:44:50.692 --> 00:44:57.417]  I wrote an analysis of Patriot Act 1 just about a week after Patriot Act 1 was written.
[00:44:58.542 --> 00:45:04.307]  And no one even knew about the provisions of it, and the average person hadn't heard about it until a year later, and that took our labor to get that out.
[00:45:04.727 --> 00:45:15.516]  Patriot Act II, it took a few months for people to learn about it, because either they have their big announcement, which blacks out everything, or they don't announce it.
[00:45:16.237 --> 00:45:17.158]  We're good to go.
[00:45:17.178 --> 00:45:17.338]  I think?
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.982]  And we have Ron Paul's quotes about what was it, H.R.
[00:45:36.002 --> 00:45:35.982]  2417.
[00:45:36.042 --> 00:45:57.414]  We have Ron Paul's quotes from a month before in November, November 4th, when the House passed it, then the Senate passed it later in November, and then quietly on December 13th, George W. Gun Grabber Bush signed it.
[00:45:58.135 --> 00:46:01.898]  And that is on the website right now.
[00:46:01.978 --> 00:46:02.999]  Thank you, Alan.
[00:46:04.119 --> 00:46:04.660]  Or Al.
[00:46:05.901 --> 00:46:10.844]  Let's now talk... I guess, who's up next here?
[00:46:12.045 --> 00:46:13.406]  James in Tennessee.
[00:46:13.466 --> 00:46:14.146]  You're on the air.
[00:46:14.186 --> 00:46:14.647]  Go ahead.
[00:46:15.487 --> 00:46:16.488]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:46:16.788 --> 00:46:17.148]  Welcome.
[00:46:18.009 --> 00:46:20.491]  It feels good having God's hand on your shoulder, doesn't it?
[00:46:21.572 --> 00:46:23.333]  Well, I hope God's hand's on my shoulder.
[00:46:23.353 --> 00:46:23.813]  Oh, he is.
[00:46:23.933 --> 00:46:24.394]  Believe me.
[00:46:24.814 --> 00:46:24.934]  Um...
[00:46:25.919 --> 00:46:28.960]  Let me tell you about the chemtrails of my experience.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.800]  First of all, I take your advice.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.561]  Don't believe anything you say.
[00:46:32.621 --> 00:46:33.261]  Research it.
[00:46:33.281 --> 00:46:38.703]  Of course, it's hard not to believe what you say because everything I've researched is basically, you know, true.
[00:46:40.643 --> 00:46:45.584]  I had taken a telescope about a year ago when I heard about this off my tripod.
[00:46:46.645 --> 00:46:54.507]  And as they were playing tic-tac-toe in the sky, and literally it's almost that kind of game now, see who can, you know, draw the best lines.
[00:46:55.126 --> 00:46:57.047]  I took it off the tripod, looked at it.
[00:46:57.847 --> 00:47:01.708]  I see four jet engines in the front, black smoke coming out.
[00:47:01.929 --> 00:47:03.709]  I look toward the tail, and what do I see?
[00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:21.876]  Something to me that resembles almost like a piece of, it's probably not PVC, but it, and you know, that distance away, you can't tell size, but I'd say it was about like six-inch piping, PVC, with holes through it, just like a crop duster has.
[00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:25.554]  I looked at that with a telescope, and I pinned right in on it.
[00:47:26.355 --> 00:47:31.242]  And white, just like, you know, it's always white, was coming right out of that pipe.
[00:47:31.843 --> 00:47:33.285]  Had nothing to do with the engines.
[00:47:33.766 --> 00:47:34.367]  Sir?
[00:47:34.828 --> 00:47:35.088]  Yes?
[00:47:35.469 --> 00:47:36.751]  There have been photos taken.
[00:47:37.643 --> 00:47:42.685]  There's what the state police in Arizona and another police officer who I know personally was on vacation there.
[00:47:42.705 --> 00:47:43.965]  He was a police officer there.
[00:47:44.305 --> 00:47:45.086]  He lives in Austin now.
[00:47:45.106 --> 00:47:46.386]  He gave me these photos years ago.
[00:47:47.086 --> 00:47:51.288]  And then he even went to MapQuest or whatever that site is and showed me a satellite photo of it.
[00:47:51.688 --> 00:47:56.229]  And there's this big admitted CIA base with hundreds of white jets.
[00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:59.310]  And they're taxiing around the satellite photo.
[00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:00.611]  They're taking off.
[00:48:01.426 --> 00:48:05.569]  And he talked to some state police, and it says no photography in this area.
[00:48:05.969 --> 00:48:06.950]  He talked to the state police.
[00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:09.852]  They said, oh, yeah, that's a CIA dusting base.
[00:48:10.132 --> 00:48:12.254]  Yeah, is that the one in Ohio you speak of?
[00:48:12.294 --> 00:48:13.514]  No, no, this is Arizona.
[00:48:13.675 --> 00:48:14.675]  Arizona, huh.
[00:48:15.216 --> 00:48:16.376]  And we posted it and covered it.
[00:48:16.396 --> 00:48:17.357]  That was a couple years ago.
[00:48:17.377 --> 00:48:19.058]  So we're basically just pests down here.
[00:48:19.098 --> 00:48:22.000]  They're spraying and, you know, too bad for us.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:28.625]  Well, my point is, six years ago, a jet flew over, left a trail, it went away in a couple minutes, maximum.
[00:48:28.945 --> 00:48:29.846]  Now they sit there for hours.
[00:48:29.866 --> 00:48:30.326]  Oh, I remember that.
[00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:32.171]  Oh, I know.
[00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:35.254]  And they fan out, just like you said, like a big net.
[00:48:35.354 --> 00:48:36.675]  We get it here in Tennessee.
[00:48:37.376 --> 00:48:38.537]  I mean, there's days you can't.
[00:48:38.637 --> 00:48:39.378]  There's no clouds.
[00:48:39.418 --> 00:48:40.719]  Here's what aggravated me.
[00:48:40.779 --> 00:48:47.807]  I called the meteorologists in our town, and I said, those are not serious clouds or whatever you're calling those clouds.
[00:48:47.847 --> 00:48:49.188]  You need to take a closer look.
[00:48:49.228 --> 00:48:50.830]  There was no clouds in the morning.
[00:48:51.522 --> 00:48:56.587]  And I saw these come from the horizon and float across, get wider and wider and wider.
[00:48:56.627 --> 00:48:59.650]  Well, by 11 o'clock news, all of a sudden they're cloud.
[00:48:59.831 --> 00:49:02.313]  Well, let me tell you, and thanks for the call, James.
[00:49:03.014 --> 00:49:04.215]  Let me tell you what I've seen.
[00:49:05.616 --> 00:49:10.782]  I have been mowing the yard or doing stuff outside for four or five hours at a time.
[00:49:11.382 --> 00:49:14.646]  It'll be 9 o'clock in the morning, totally crystal blue sky.
[00:49:15.299 --> 00:49:18.141]  It could be summer, it could be winter, it could be fall, it could be spring.
[00:49:18.621 --> 00:49:19.721]  I see it every couple of weeks.
[00:49:20.001 --> 00:49:21.102]  Crystal blue sky.
[00:49:21.122 --> 00:49:23.944]  You know, the old blue skies of Texas, deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:49:24.204 --> 00:49:25.204]  We don't have those anymore.
[00:49:26.265 --> 00:49:30.787]  And here will come jets, and there'll be jets right beside them not leaving trails.
[00:49:31.167 --> 00:49:33.609]  But here will come jets leaving these trails.
[00:49:33.809 --> 00:49:39.032]  I will watch them over the next hour lay a trail down every, you know...
[00:49:40.626 --> 00:49:51.796]  A couple thousand feet from each other at the same level, and then I'll watch them expand, and I'll watch them touch, and you can even see when the canopy's formed where the stripes are, where the tips are touching.
[00:49:52.396 --> 00:50:05.668]  It looks like bars in a prison, and then you watch them merge together and then start drifting down, pluming down, weird tentacles coming down, and I just sit there and I just watch it.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.762]  Over and over and over and over again.
[00:50:09.163 --> 00:50:11.104]  And I've never seen this in my life!
[00:50:12.105 --> 00:50:13.286]  In my whole life!
[00:50:14.988 --> 00:50:16.129]  I've never seen this!
[00:50:16.269 --> 00:50:17.890]  And then I read this London Guardian article.
[00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:20.152]  Earth is 20% darker, say experts.
[00:50:20.672 --> 00:50:28.119]  NASA says there's weird particulates in the air causing the Earth to become 20% darker, affecting plant growth, everything.
[00:50:28.812 --> 00:50:35.274]  And that's experts at the Goddard Space Institute for Space Science in New York.
[00:50:35.715 --> 00:50:37.475]  And that's Dr. Hansen saying that.
[00:50:37.495 --> 00:50:39.076]  And I've got dozens of these reports.
[00:50:40.016 --> 00:50:46.439]  And I have multiple reports where they admit that they are doing some type of weather manipulation, but then you test what's in them.
[00:50:46.459 --> 00:50:47.699]  It's barium salts.
[00:50:47.819 --> 00:50:49.680]  It's flu virus.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.360]  This is amazing.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.822]  And it's a giant $100 billion program.
[00:50:55.902 --> 00:50:57.903]  And it's going on all over the Western world.
[00:50:57.943 --> 00:50:58.463]  We'll be back.
[00:51:01.289 --> 00:51:07.210]  Oh my... I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:51:07.351 --> 00:51:07.971]  Yes, it's true.
[00:51:07.991 --> 00:51:10.751]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:51:10.871 --> 00:51:14.852]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:51:14.932 --> 00:51:15.512]  You heard it right.
[00:51:15.673 --> 00:51:20.634]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:51:20.734 --> 00:51:21.754]  The list goes on and on.
[00:51:22.014 --> 00:51:22.334]  We're good to go.
[00:51:38.968 --> 00:51:39.829]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:12.065]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:52:12.265 --> 00:52:19.849]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:29.260]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:52:29.541 --> 00:52:35.688]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:52:36.028 --> 00:52:39.930]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.871]  The water level is always visible.
[00:52:42.051 --> 00:52:47.993]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:52:48.233 --> 00:52:51.935]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.955 --> 00:52:52.455]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.059 --> 00:53:05.382]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:09.984]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:53:10.144 --> 00:53:14.507]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:53:14.567 --> 00:53:15.908]  The New World Order.
[00:53:17.708 --> 00:53:21.931]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:53:21.991 --> 00:53:28.915]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:53:29.056 --> 00:53:31.037]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:53:31.434 --> 00:53:41.762]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:53:42.042 --> 00:53:47.406]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:53:47.927 --> 00:53:50.529]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:51.149]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:53:51.189 --> 00:53:51.690]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:52.990]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:54:09.372 --> 00:54:11.293]  Coming up, folks, we do have George Humphrey.
[00:54:11.313 --> 00:54:13.314]  If you haven't heard him on air, you definitely want to stay with us.
[00:54:14.134 --> 00:54:20.457]  Former city council member, very successful businessman here in Austin, writer and filmmaker exposing the New World Order.
[00:54:21.978 --> 00:54:22.878]  That's coming up.
[00:54:22.918 --> 00:54:26.660]  We'll just take calls right away with our guests and get into the enemy combatant news.
[00:54:27.432 --> 00:54:27.652]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:27.672 --> 00:54:28.312]  It's been a while.
[00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:29.633]  Okay, let's go back to the sky.
[00:54:29.653 --> 00:54:32.053]  The day before Thanksgiving, the day after Thanksgiving, I've got pictures.
[00:54:56.794 --> 00:55:00.935]  The Sunday... Oh, what the heck was the Sunday?
[00:55:00.995 --> 00:55:02.516]  Okay, but you saw something.
[00:55:02.556 --> 00:55:02.896]  Go ahead.
[00:55:03.256 --> 00:55:05.517]  Oh, Sunday the 30th of November.
[00:55:06.197 --> 00:55:10.338]  I never saw it like this ever, and I've been watching it, what, three, four years now?
[00:55:11.178 --> 00:55:13.799]  And it was from all day long.
[00:55:14.539 --> 00:55:17.940]  I went through... And for those that don't know, what was all day long?
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.141]  The sky was just filled.
[00:55:20.621 --> 00:55:21.341]  Filled with what?
[00:55:21.521 --> 00:55:25.142]  With the chemtrails, what we're referring to as chemtrails.
[00:55:26.254 --> 00:55:29.835]  Lines, circles, tic-tac-toes, X's.
[00:55:30.695 --> 00:55:34.157]  I went up to the store and got the film replaced.
[00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:35.277]  I ran out of film.
[00:55:36.577 --> 00:55:47.240]  And then even at 10 of 6, that was the 30th of November, it was already dusk, getting ready to go dark, and there was planes laying it out.
[00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:55.343]  The following Wednesday, then this past Tuesday, when the moon was full,
[00:55:55.942 --> 00:56:02.605]  It was all day Tuesday, and then Tuesday evening, the sky was filled with light because of the full moon.
[00:56:02.865 --> 00:56:05.126]  They were still doing it at night.
[00:56:05.366 --> 00:56:11.948]  Joni, I've seen space photos, stuff released by NASA, weather reports.
[00:56:12.288 --> 00:56:17.630]  You're just watching it, and all over the cities, there's these giant lines and connections.
[00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:19.971]  You can see it from the satellites.
[00:56:20.051 --> 00:56:20.832]  It's so huge.
[00:56:21.052 --> 00:56:24.453]  Well, have people thought of doing a Michael Jackson...
[00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:36.414]  And actually putting something to protect their face, like a paper mask, you know, that they wear for when they're... Well, my point is that four or five years ago they were doing it at 20,000 feet.
[00:56:36.794 --> 00:56:38.475]  Now they're doing it at 3,000 feet.
[00:56:39.815 --> 00:56:48.339]  Trails aren't supposed to form at that level, and I'm sitting here watching jets fly over low, doing it right next to planes that aren't leaving trails.
[00:56:48.539 --> 00:56:49.799]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:54.121]  And people... I had somebody tell me, a professional person, Friday...
[00:56:54.605 --> 00:57:05.491]  This past Friday, a lady and I were talking, and we were looking up, and I was showing her some of the pictures, and this medical person came out, and he looked up at the sky.
[00:57:05.511 --> 00:57:06.912]  He said, what are you girls looking at?
[00:57:07.493 --> 00:57:11.795]  And we told him, and he said, oh, that's just the weather front coming in.
[00:57:11.815 --> 00:57:12.356]  Oh, yeah.
[00:57:12.376 --> 00:57:13.476]  Weather front, my eye.
[00:57:13.556 --> 00:57:13.996]  Sure it is.
[00:57:14.016 --> 00:57:14.897]  Thanks for the call, Joan.
[00:57:15.317 --> 00:57:15.858]  Great points.
[00:57:15.878 --> 00:57:16.518]  Good to hear from you.
[00:57:16.538 --> 00:57:18.039]  We'll come back and talk to everybody else.
[00:57:18.419 --> 00:57:19.640]  Before I end this hour...
[00:57:21.056 --> 00:57:21.977]  Be part of history.
[00:57:22.017 --> 00:57:23.058]  Take action, folks.
[00:57:23.158 --> 00:57:23.959]  Have an effect.
[00:57:24.119 --> 00:57:25.080]  Get my videos.
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:26.882]  If you have them, make copies of them.
[00:57:26.942 --> 00:57:27.943]  Get them out to people.
[00:57:28.303 --> 00:57:29.524]  Put them on cable access.
[00:57:29.544 --> 00:57:33.708]  Give them to opinion makers, talk show hosts, pastors, public officials.
[00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:41.956]  Matrix of Evil's my newest with Ron Paul, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, Frank Morales, Colonel Craig Roberts, myself.
[00:57:43.297 --> 00:57:45.119]  Amazing new two-plus-hour video.
[00:57:46.243 --> 00:57:48.164]  Then there's Masters of Terror.
[00:57:48.224 --> 00:57:49.645]  There's 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:57:50.065 --> 00:57:51.826]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:57:51.886 --> 00:57:52.406]  Police State.
[00:57:52.426 --> 00:57:53.327]  Three Total Enslavement.
[00:57:53.627 --> 00:57:56.268]  Paul Watson's new book, Order Out of Chaos, that I published.
[00:57:56.748 --> 00:58:00.851]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order the videos.
[00:58:00.871 --> 00:58:02.131]  They're $25.95 apiece.
[00:58:02.151 --> 00:58:03.272]  Some are two and a half hours long.
[00:58:03.532 --> 00:58:04.512]  They're all over two hours.
[00:58:04.893 --> 00:58:05.693]  Order three or more.
[00:58:05.733 --> 00:58:07.754]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:58:08.054 --> 00:58:09.035]  That's a big discount.
[00:58:09.455 --> 00:58:10.976]  Here's the toll-free number to order.
[00:58:10.996 --> 00:58:11.036]  1-888-
[00:58:13.337 --> 00:58:13.397]  253-3139.
[00:58:13.437 --> 00:58:14.858]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:58:14.878 --> 00:58:16.858]  Operators are there right now.
[00:58:16.878 --> 00:58:16.918]  888-253-3139.
[00:58:16.938 --> 00:58:19.599]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:36.767 --> 00:58:42.050]  Get the videos, get the books, spread the word, educate the people about the New World Order.
[00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:43.571]  These are amazing films and books.
[00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:45.172]  You need to have them.
[00:58:45.872 --> 00:58:48.634]  Second hour, a ton of news, your calls, and a guest straight ahead.
[00:58:51.531 --> 00:58:54.813]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:58:54.873 --> 00:58:59.036]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:58:59.297 --> 00:59:02.099]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:59:02.279 --> 00:59:04.680]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:59:04.881 --> 00:59:13.527]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:59:13.707 --> 00:59:15.068]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:59:15.248 --> 00:59:19.511]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:59:19.651 --> 00:59:20.172]  We're good to go.
[00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:43.451]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:44.412]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:44.492 --> 00:59:45.632]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:01.844]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.505 --> 01:00:03.325]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.086 --> 01:00:04.987]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.007 --> 01:00:09.291]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.851 --> 01:00:13.955]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.736 --> 01:00:16.897]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:17.097 --> 01:00:20.320]  Hour two of this global transmission against tyranny.
[01:00:21.301 --> 01:00:22.362]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:00:23.672 --> 01:00:27.294]  The toll-free number to get involved on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:27.354 --> 01:00:38.261]  The London Guardian, and I've seen dozens of such articles from major institutions around the world, is reporting that NASA admits the Earth is 20% darker.
[01:00:39.041 --> 01:00:46.506]  Mysterious particulates are now blocking out the sun, part of a massive weather modification program.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:55.564]  And we know that many jets are fitted and are spraying something, even at a couple thousand feet, where it's impossible for condensation trails to form.
[01:00:57.265 --> 01:01:01.206]  It's amazing, ladies and gentlemen, and we'll be getting back into that.
[01:01:01.527 --> 01:01:04.188]  Also, Bush overruled on enemy combatant case.
[01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:07.509]  That's some good news by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
[01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:14.973]  We have George Humphrey, researcher, fighter of the New World Order extraordinaire, joining us coming up later in this hour.
[01:01:16.124 --> 01:01:24.327]  And, of course, a ton of other vital news and information concerning Lord Bush and his family being paid off by the Communist Chinese to cut Taiwan loose.
[01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:27.729]  Something the neocons are trying to cover up desperately.
[01:01:28.629 --> 01:01:30.510]  Right now, let's go to Dick in Indiana.
[01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:31.210]  You're on the air.
[01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.610]  Welcome.
[01:01:33.931 --> 01:01:34.712]  Good to talk to you.
[01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:35.452]  You're on the air.
[01:01:35.472 --> 01:01:38.273]  Okay, do we have Dick?
[01:01:39.854 --> 01:01:41.114]  He must be away from his phone.
[01:01:41.514 --> 01:01:43.335]  Yeah, Mr. Jones.
[01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:43.875]  Yes.
[01:01:44.696 --> 01:01:45.076]  I, uh...
[01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:50.456]  I hope this is important about the chemtrails.
[01:01:53.177 --> 01:01:53.458]  Okay.
[01:01:53.498 --> 01:01:55.719]  I got a document back from the Congress.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.763]  I think I sent you a copy maybe three, four, five months ago.
[01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.684]  Okay, you got a document.
[01:02:03.685 --> 01:02:11.771]  And it says here that I understand you are concerned with the chemical trails and support HR 2977.
[01:02:14.304 --> 01:02:16.145]  And that was a bill that would ban that.
[01:02:16.905 --> 01:02:17.646]  That was banned?
[01:02:18.286 --> 01:02:23.589]  No, that's a bill that if it would have been passed, introduced by Kucinich, would have.
[01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.370]  Right.
[01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:32.234]  And also it says, this bill acknowledges the existence of chemical trail.
[01:02:33.355 --> 01:02:35.436]  Yes, there's even treaties on it.
[01:02:35.916 --> 01:02:38.978]  And I think it was changed maybe to 3616?
[01:02:41.419 --> 01:02:42.920]  Yes, the bill was not passed.
[01:02:43.692 --> 01:02:44.432]  It wasn't passed.
[01:02:44.452 --> 01:02:45.593]  It wasn't passed.
[01:02:45.653 --> 01:02:50.315]  And we have a copy of the bill in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:02:51.355 --> 01:02:52.596]  Okay.
[01:02:52.656 --> 01:02:53.496]  One other thing, Alex.
[01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:57.798]  I put your Bohemian Grove on cable access the other day.
[01:02:58.318 --> 01:02:58.799]  Wonderful.
[01:02:59.199 --> 01:03:06.342]  And when I got it back, they had blocked out a portion where George W. was involved.
[01:03:08.499 --> 01:03:12.700]  The local access station erased the tape or didn't air it?
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.601]  No, they erased two parts of it.
[01:03:15.021 --> 01:03:21.022]  One in the middle, I don't know what that was, but I know that they did erase the part where Georgia W was.
[01:03:21.942 --> 01:03:24.483]  You could just see just a real quick flash of him.
[01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:29.424]  You're talking about where I show news articles with him there?
[01:03:29.524 --> 01:03:30.404]  That was blocked out?
[01:03:30.664 --> 01:03:30.885]  Yes.
[01:03:32.205 --> 01:03:33.265]  Yeah, they glued it out.
[01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:35.346]  Where is that in Indiana, Dick?
[01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:36.666]  Richmond.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.440]  But they did air it.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.861]  Oh, yeah, they did air it.
[01:03:42.241 --> 01:03:43.921]  And then they destroyed your property.
[01:03:44.181 --> 01:03:45.102]  They destroyed it.
[01:03:46.762 --> 01:03:50.823]  Well, Dick, write me a letter, and I appreciate you airing that.
[01:03:50.883 --> 01:03:52.583]  We'll try to get you another copy.
[01:03:54.063 --> 01:04:00.125]  And that is disgusting, and you need to demand that they pay you for damaging your property.
[01:04:00.625 --> 01:04:01.325]  Yeah, I hear that.
[01:04:01.705 --> 01:04:03.285]  And you need to get it re-aired there.
[01:04:05.086 --> 01:04:07.326]  And so what else did they block out?
[01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:11.584]  Well, as far as I know, that's all they blocked out.
[01:04:11.724 --> 01:04:17.475]  But I did get a letter saying that I have to have only local...
[01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:22.311]  Well, that's what happens, yeah.
[01:04:22.591 --> 01:04:23.972]  They'll claim local interest.
[01:04:23.992 --> 01:04:24.952]  Well, this is an interest.
[01:04:24.972 --> 01:04:25.733]  He's a president.
[01:04:25.993 --> 01:04:27.113]  He's a national figure.
[01:04:27.454 --> 01:04:28.594]  It affects things locally.
[01:04:28.694 --> 01:04:30.215]  They're violating their own rules.
[01:04:30.575 --> 01:04:32.316]  They're trying to keep you from airing that.
[01:04:32.876 --> 01:04:33.237]  Okay.
[01:04:33.397 --> 01:04:36.338]  You need to go in there and say, the president is national.
[01:04:36.578 --> 01:04:38.619]  This affects everything local.
[01:04:38.899 --> 01:04:40.420]  This is a local issue.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.901]  How dare you?
[01:04:41.921 --> 01:04:42.881]  I will do that.
[01:04:43.222 --> 01:04:45.983]  Like, they'll try to stop people from airing the Clinton Chronicles.
[01:04:46.855 --> 01:04:48.055]  Because it exposes Clinton.
[01:04:48.316 --> 01:04:50.576]  Well, that's a national issue which affects you locally.
[01:04:53.177 --> 01:04:57.518]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:57.699 --> 01:05:02.100]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.641]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:05:06.681 --> 01:05:08.002]  The New World Order.
[01:05:08.742 --> 01:05:09.143]  Can emerge.
[01:05:09.824 --> 01:05:14.028]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:14.108 --> 01:05:21.036]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:21.176 --> 01:05:23.159]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.539 --> 01:05:33.883]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:39.505]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:05:40.045 --> 01:05:42.666]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:05:42.786 --> 01:05:43.966]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:05:44.526 --> 01:05:46.247]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:56.051]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:05:56.331 --> 01:05:59.833]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:59.913 --> 01:06:03.855]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:06:04.095 --> 01:06:10.258]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:06:10.659 --> 01:06:18.563]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:06:18.983 --> 01:06:24.327]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:06:24.487 --> 01:06:28.250]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:30.472]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:06:30.532 --> 01:06:32.714]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:06:32.954 --> 01:06:37.877]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:06:37.937 --> 01:06:43.482]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:06:46.624 --> 01:06:48.165]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:07:11.425 --> 01:07:12.105]  We're good to go.
[01:07:28.991 --> 01:07:29.411]  Big Brother.
[01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:03.333]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.094 --> 01:08:04.995]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.015 --> 01:08:09.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.841 --> 01:08:13.906]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.057 --> 01:08:20.238]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:20.358 --> 01:08:21.158]  until 2 p.m.
[01:08:21.739 --> 01:08:22.959]  Central Standard Time.
[01:08:22.999 --> 01:08:25.000]  We're here on the air, my friends.
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:30.482]  Going out on the AM and FM dial from Los Angeles, California to Providence, Rhode Island.
[01:08:31.722 --> 01:08:34.363]  And many points from Denver to Kansas City in between.
[01:08:34.763 --> 01:08:36.544]  Albuquerque to Austin, Texas.
[01:08:37.104 --> 01:08:38.364]  Rochester, New York.
[01:08:38.845 --> 01:08:39.965]  Pensacola, Florida.
[01:08:40.678 --> 01:09:07.195]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave at 12.172 and 93.20 from 11 to 2 during the day and at night at 5.085 and 68.90 and on the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com Now, before I go to our guest and the news and the loaded phone lines, I know a lot of stations carry the news in the first five minutes of each hour.
[01:09:07.515 --> 01:09:09.496]  We just had a caller, Dick in Indiana,
[01:09:10.177 --> 01:09:18.133]  Who got my film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, where three years ago I snuck in with a hidden camera to the Bohemian Grove.
[01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:19.984]  We're good to go.
[01:09:49.369 --> 01:09:50.589]  Tried to air it on AXS TV.
[01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:54.511]  He says they erased several parts of it that had Bush in it.
[01:09:54.531 --> 01:09:58.793]  And then he got it back with a letter saying you can only have local programming on.
[01:09:59.653 --> 01:10:10.837]  Now, I've seen this a hundred plus times because my films, I mean, I've been in a hotel room in Kansas City or a hotel room in Houston and turned on AXS and there I am because listeners have done this.
[01:10:10.977 --> 01:10:13.979]  And if you've got good programs, people will watch AXS.
[01:10:14.059 --> 01:10:17.380]  And we've reached millions of people through AXS television.
[01:10:18.735 --> 01:10:25.038]  I've signed over 400 waiver forms for folks to air them on their local access stations.
[01:10:25.058 --> 01:10:28.040]  Even though the films say at the end you're authorized to do it, people still want those.
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:32.522]  So I know this is a chink in the dragon's armor.
[01:10:34.243 --> 01:10:43.728]  And so what you do is when you try to air one of my documentaries locally on access, and they say they'll usually air it, then they'll get one or two complaints from the mayor saying,
[01:10:45.115 --> 01:10:46.357]  There's been a bunch of news articles.
[01:10:48.419 --> 01:10:52.964]  Probably 20 times I've gotten newspaper articles where it causes big controversies.
[01:10:53.344 --> 01:10:54.425]  Big ones in Maine.
[01:10:54.466 --> 01:10:56.388]  They shut down the whole access station because of it.
[01:10:56.788 --> 01:10:58.610]  Controversies in upstate New York.
[01:10:58.670 --> 01:10:59.891]  Controversies in Florida.
[01:11:00.692 --> 01:11:01.333]  Over the films.
[01:11:01.373 --> 01:11:02.414]  We've covered those on air.
[01:11:02.434 --> 01:11:03.515]  We've had guests on about it.
[01:11:04.196 --> 01:11:04.837]  We're good to go.
[01:11:25.743 --> 01:11:26.344]  We're good to go.
[01:11:26.364 --> 01:11:27.404]  We're good to go.
[01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:47.715]  Tape all the federal propaganda tapes.
[01:11:47.795 --> 01:11:50.715]  Tape the other stuff that was made outside the city.
[01:11:51.115 --> 01:11:54.276]  Show that they're airing stuff that doesn't have a local interest.
[01:11:54.776 --> 01:11:58.677]  Then go to them and say, you better air my tape or I'm going to sue you for discrimination.
[01:11:58.697 --> 01:12:00.257]  It's real simple.
[01:12:01.777 --> 01:12:10.879]  Because they're trying to stop you from reaching, in a small town, tens of thousands of people, in a big city, hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.240]  And so this is a big way to reach folks.
[01:12:15.078 --> 01:12:16.719]  And these are local interests.
[01:12:16.739 --> 01:12:21.883]  When we're talking about the police state, we're talking about our world leaders, that affects us all.
[01:12:22.164 --> 01:12:23.124]  This is political.
[01:12:23.224 --> 01:12:24.746]  It is the purest form of free speech.
[01:12:25.126 --> 01:12:26.727]  What access TV was meant for?
[01:12:27.728 --> 01:12:31.651]  And we cannot put up with this trash.
[01:12:33.038 --> 01:12:45.222]  And joining me is a former city council member, very successful local businessman who has his own popular cable access show, which hundreds of thousands of people watch each month conservatively.
[01:12:45.242 --> 01:12:51.824]  And he's George Humphrey, and he is an author, a lecturer, and a good friend of mine.
[01:12:51.844 --> 01:12:59.707]  And we've got him riding shotgun with us for the next hour and a half, if he can stay with us, to go over the news and get his take on it and to take your calls.
[01:13:00.367 --> 01:13:01.868]  But George, good to have you on.
[01:13:02.563 --> 01:13:04.884]  Alex, it's always a pleasure to be on the show with you.
[01:13:04.924 --> 01:13:06.925]  You've been doing such a great job lately.
[01:13:07.565 --> 01:13:16.789]  Well, isn't it frustrating to hear of access TV stations taking people's tapes, editing out key parts, then telling them you can't air this anymore?
[01:13:17.509 --> 01:13:24.652]  Well, it's amazing because the exact thing that you're talking about has not happened to me as many times, but it has happened to me.
[01:13:25.512 --> 01:13:30.074]  And it is amazing that the country that is supposed to have the First Amendment passed
[01:13:31.127 --> 01:13:47.911]  By the way, on the big access station in Austin, whose name is on the plaque from when they broke ground on it?
[01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:49.611]  Who voted to put that in?
[01:13:50.211 --> 01:13:52.592]  Well, there were several of us that worked on it.
[01:13:52.692 --> 01:13:54.052]  But your name is on it.
[01:13:54.651 --> 01:13:54.792]  Yeah.
[01:13:54.992 --> 01:14:03.374]  And now, on my show, on your show, specifically the Patriot shows, what happens for the last two months every time we're on, George?
[01:14:05.288 --> 01:14:11.033]  Well, at least on my show, is that there has been some technical interference.
[01:14:11.233 --> 01:14:13.935]  Now, I don't know what is causing that.
[01:14:13.955 --> 01:14:15.456]  Okay, well, we know.
[01:14:15.636 --> 01:14:22.802]  It's an FM modulator sending it through Grande and Time Warner, and it happened three years ago.
[01:14:22.862 --> 01:14:26.145]  We demanded they stop it, and it blacks out, folks.
[01:14:26.165 --> 01:14:27.246]  They're blacking us out.
[01:14:27.266 --> 01:14:28.547]  It only happens on our shows.
[01:14:29.107 --> 01:14:30.909]  Well, we, as a matter of fact...
[01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:34.896]  And again, I'm not saying that they are doing this.
[01:14:34.956 --> 01:14:38.983]  I'm just telling you, telling the listeners what happened last night on my show.
[01:14:39.424 --> 01:14:42.028]  We couldn't get up for the first two and a half minutes.
[01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.730]  But anyway...
[01:14:43.696 --> 01:15:04.170]  I am so very grateful that here in Austin we do have this access because we have the ability to speak to the people and with shows like yours and three or four other shows is that Austin in many ways has become somewhat educated and one of the leaders of the resistance to what's going on.
[01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:08.773]  And it all has to do with education and information.
[01:15:09.983 --> 01:15:12.464]  Well, it does, and, you know, they're shutting access down around the country.
[01:15:12.484 --> 01:15:19.708]  I didn't mean to get off into a discussion of this, but for folks that haven't put my films on or haven't gotten your own shows, you need to do it.
[01:15:19.768 --> 01:15:21.969]  This is a way we have millions of listeners.
[01:15:22.009 --> 01:15:24.731]  If all of you in your town go get an access show.
[01:15:25.566 --> 01:15:28.207]  And are they trying to stop you, get their rules, get around it?
[01:15:28.847 --> 01:15:29.948]  It's easy most places.
[01:15:29.968 --> 01:15:31.769]  A lot of times they're patriots there, folks.
[01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:33.769]  Most of the time they'll be happy to put you on.
[01:15:34.049 --> 01:15:35.510]  Just some of the time you get resistance.
[01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:37.651]  You need to put this on.
[01:15:37.691 --> 01:15:42.033]  You need... This is a venue to reach millions of people, George.
[01:15:42.853 --> 01:15:43.793]  Well, absolutely.
[01:15:43.833 --> 01:15:48.996]  And again, as Sir Francis Bacon said, he said, knowledge is power.
[01:15:49.816 --> 01:15:49.916]  And...
[01:15:50.569 --> 01:16:16.302]  Day in and day out, I meet people who, when you give them the objective information, and it is my belief that 95% plus of the people in this country want there to be a constitutional government, want there to be fair rules, want there to be a Bill of Rights, want there to be justice within our courts, and are opposed to the small handful of
[01:16:17.097 --> 01:16:22.379]  Who have absolute control of our Federal Reserve, of the media, and both political parties.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.741]  But the problem is that most people are uneducated.
[01:16:27.102 --> 01:16:30.263]  They don't have access to the objective information.
[01:16:30.863 --> 01:16:43.649]  And because of the mind-controlling techniques that have been put on us incrementally for the last 30 years, is that most people are afraid to even look or go further.
[01:16:43.789 --> 01:16:46.390]  And so shows like yours and mine and others...
[01:16:46.877 --> 01:16:48.498]  That are giving people the message.
[01:16:48.918 --> 01:16:51.859]  And you are speaking with an open heart, Alex.
[01:16:52.239 --> 01:16:59.783]  And we have to speak to our friends and the listeners and let them know that there's nothing to be afraid of.
[01:17:00.843 --> 01:17:05.486]  Of course we have concerns, but we are the ones playing by the rules.
[01:17:05.606 --> 01:17:08.067]  We're the ones who believe in justice.
[01:17:08.127 --> 01:17:10.188]  We're the ones who believe in the Constitution.
[01:17:10.568 --> 01:17:12.549]  We're the ones who want equal rights.
[01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:15.130]  We're the ones who believe in the American Dream.
[01:17:15.717 --> 01:17:16.358]  We are a republic.
[01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:17.318]  We are not an empire.
[01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:42.022]  And that's where the line has to be drawn.
[01:17:42.042 --> 01:17:48.905]  Now, George, I want to throw a bunch of news articles out when we get back and then go to some calls, and we're so honored to have you here with us today.
[01:17:48.926 --> 01:17:51.207]  But people keep calling about this, so let me recap it.
[01:17:51.567 --> 01:17:55.328]  While Saddam was captured, stealth enactment of Patriot Act II legislation.
[01:17:55.849 --> 01:17:57.469]  Ron Paulin comments on H.R.
[01:17:57.489 --> 01:18:02.172]  2417, the Intelligence Authorization Agreement, Patriot Act under new name.
[01:18:02.652 --> 01:18:05.093]  He says, it appears we are witnessing a stealth enactment.
[01:18:05.413 --> 01:18:08.355]  ...of the enormously unpopular Patriot Act II legislation.
[01:18:08.695 --> 01:18:21.324]  Paul told the Associated Press President Bush has signed legislation making it easier for the FBI agents to go into any business or the CIA to go into any business or company without a warrant, without seeking court approval.
[01:18:21.924 --> 01:18:24.025]  This is much of Patriot Act II.
[01:18:24.486 --> 01:18:30.650]  Past Saturday with no fanfare announced Sunday and the average person has no idea about this, George.
[01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:32.091]  Exactly.
[01:18:32.571 --> 01:18:48.299]  And as many, many people from both the right and the left who have any sort of historical knowledge know, is that George Bush has legislated laws that are far more draconian than what Adolf Hitler had in 1939.
[01:18:48.359 --> 01:18:56.643]  Friend, what we are facing is something that is so potentially sad for our nation and our culture.
[01:18:57.105 --> 01:19:07.287]  And if we don't take preemptive action to restore our constitutional rights right now, then the future of this nation is very, very dark.
[01:19:07.347 --> 01:19:09.348]  And this H.R.
[01:19:09.368 --> 01:19:13.189]  2417 is nothing more than Patriot Act No.
[01:19:13.209 --> 01:19:15.509]  2, and it is going further.
[01:19:15.609 --> 01:19:22.611]  And together with the presidential directives that have been signed by Bush is that we have no posse comitatus,
[01:19:23.109 --> 01:19:28.330]  We have no Fourth Amendment, we have no Fifth Amendment, we have no First Amendment, and no Tenth Amendment.
[01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:41.053]  And friends, our Constitution is being destroyed as we speak, and it is up to every single one of us who believe in the constitutional process to say not only no, but hell no.
[01:19:41.874 --> 01:19:47.315]  And there's a lot of resistance, a lot of awakening to this, and here they are sneaking it through.
[01:19:48.195 --> 01:19:50.056]  We'll be right back, and we'll take your calls.
[01:19:50.076 --> 01:19:51.476]  I'm going to do a bunch of news with our guests.

[01:20:52.791 --> 01:20:55.892]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[01:20:56.372 --> 01:20:58.393]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[01:20:58.753 --> 01:21:01.354]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.

[01:21:15.439 --> 01:21:15.839]  I think?

[01:21:43.043 --> 01:21:43.584]  That's Midas at 800-686-2237.

[01:22:51.664 --> 01:22:57.906]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:22:58.046 --> 01:23:04.188]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:23:04.488 --> 01:23:12.931]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:23:13.171 --> 01:23:20.193]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:23:20.493 --> 01:23:20.953]  We're good to go.
[01:23:20.973 --> 01:23:21.333]  We're good to go.
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:01.802]  We're going to be talking about 9-11 with our guests.
[01:24:01.822 --> 01:24:07.567]  We're going to be talking about the Iraq and the Saddam situation, the lies we've been told, and your calls.
[01:24:08.048 --> 01:24:13.013]  We're about to go to Shelvin and TJ and Wyatt and Jay and Tony and others here in just a few minutes.
[01:24:13.033 --> 01:24:15.355]  We've got George Humphrey, my good friend, on with us.
[01:24:15.995 --> 01:24:19.119]  Bush overruled an enemy combatant case, Associated Press.
[01:24:19.159 --> 01:24:22.282]  President Bush does not have power to detain American citizens.
[01:24:23.082 --> 01:24:26.683]  Now, I have the Justice Department's arguments on this from yesterday.
[01:24:52.788 --> 01:25:00.057]  And they say not just if they're a terrorist, but if the president so designates or his designates designate.
[01:25:00.077 --> 01:25:03.722]  See, they're already implementing Patriot Act II before they even passed it.
[01:25:04.389 --> 01:25:17.156]  They were doing this over a year and a half ago, and it allows them to snatch and grab you to disappear and to secretly execute you, by the way, according to Section 501, for any reason, to take you to a foreign country, to torture you.
[01:25:18.237 --> 01:25:23.320]  And the average person, again, has no idea this is even going on.
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:28.223]  Now we have General Tommy Franks and cigar aficionados saying Marshall Law is the next phase.
[01:25:28.563 --> 01:25:35.988]  General Eberhardt, the current head of NORTHCOM in Colorado Springs, telling the LA Times four weeks ago that Marshall Law is a good thing.
[01:25:36.389 --> 01:25:37.870]  George Humphrey comments on this.
[01:25:39.491 --> 01:25:48.997]  Well, I think it's fairly self-explanatory is that for anyone who is paying any attention realizes that we are not moving toward a police state.
[01:25:49.057 --> 01:25:50.278]  We are in a police state.
[01:25:51.485 --> 01:25:58.829]  Not only have the laws been signed, but the police in the local jurisdictions have become militarized.
[01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:01.110]  We have cameras in our streets.
[01:26:01.731 --> 01:26:07.614]  This last year alone, there were over 14 million wiretaps without warrants.
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:18.228]  Is that there is an unbelievable 24-7 barrage of misinformation from the predominant media.
[01:26:18.248 --> 01:26:33.021]  And the worst thing is that the people of our country, the home of the free and the land of the brave, the people of our country have become so desensitized and they have become so brainwashed and they're acting like absolute cowards.
[01:26:33.782 --> 01:26:36.524]  And the only thing that's going to turn this around
[01:26:37.182 --> 01:26:40.964]  Is when the little boy comes up and says, the emperor has no clothes.
[01:26:41.444 --> 01:26:45.985]  And that little boy has to be all the people who are listening to this show.
[01:26:46.006 --> 01:26:48.086]  It can't just be Alex and myself.
[01:26:48.206 --> 01:26:50.127]  It has to be every single one of us.
[01:26:50.567 --> 01:26:56.950]  Because if we stand shoulder to shoulder and say, no, this is not what America is about.
[01:26:57.090 --> 01:26:58.891]  This is not the way we're going.
[01:26:59.591 --> 01:27:05.053]  And as Thomas Paine said, the cause of America is in great measure the cause of all mankind.
[01:27:05.663 --> 01:27:05.923]  Thank you.
[01:27:05.943 --> 01:27:06.423]  Thank you.
[01:27:18.974 --> 01:27:24.921]  And it's not just an economic, political, or a cultural fight.
[01:27:25.301 --> 01:27:28.165]  This is, in fact, a real spiritual question.
[01:27:28.565 --> 01:27:30.508]  And all of us have to make up our minds.
[01:27:30.808 --> 01:27:32.530]  Which side of the fence are we going to be on?
[01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:36.655]  Are we going to be on the side of the secular atheist materialists?
[01:27:37.384 --> 01:27:43.387]  Or are we going to be on the side of the people who believe in the republic and who believe in justice and who believe in God?
[01:27:43.907 --> 01:27:47.468]  And I think 99% of your listeners know which side that they're on.
[01:27:47.749 --> 01:27:49.529]  Absolutely, but they've got to stand up.
[01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:52.030]  Let's talk to Shelvin in Arizona.
[01:27:52.050 --> 01:27:52.671]  You're on the air.
[01:27:52.691 --> 01:27:53.331]  Thanks for holding.
[01:27:53.371 --> 01:27:53.711]  Welcome.
[01:27:54.571 --> 01:27:55.052]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:55.312 --> 01:27:56.512]  Yes.
[01:27:57.153 --> 01:28:00.074]  Got a comment, question, comment.
[01:28:00.154 --> 01:28:04.336]  First one is that secret CIA base you were talking about.
[01:28:04.636 --> 01:28:04.856]  Yes.
[01:28:05.305 --> 01:28:06.266]  Well, I'm in Tucson.
[01:28:06.286 --> 01:28:07.287]  I'm really close to it.
[01:28:07.347 --> 01:28:11.791]  That's the Pinal Air Park exit, mile marker 232 on I-10.
[01:28:12.151 --> 01:28:12.791]  Yes, it is.
[01:28:12.811 --> 01:28:16.875]  The exit sign says Army National Guard Aviation Training Site.
[01:28:16.915 --> 01:28:23.901]  It's coincidentally very close to the northwest side of Tucson where our local outbreak of flu started.
[01:28:25.622 --> 01:28:27.484]  I just wanted to add that as a comment.
[01:28:27.984 --> 01:28:30.186]  Well, that's an admitted chemtrailing base.
[01:28:30.706 --> 01:28:33.629]  It's nice to work out there, too, and there's signs all over that says
[01:28:34.284 --> 01:28:37.085]  Photography of this area prohibited, so that's the one.
[01:28:37.505 --> 01:28:41.567]  And there's dozens and dozens and dozens of big old jets, white jets.
[01:28:43.808 --> 01:28:51.112]  Essentially, they have mothballed airliners out there, and you'd think what's so secret about it.
[01:28:53.333 --> 01:28:56.434]  Well, we know what they're doing, drug shipments and the rest of it.
[01:28:56.974 --> 01:28:58.495]  George, comments on the chemtrails?
[01:28:59.662 --> 01:29:11.651]  Well, it's funny because for the last five years is that the chemtrails, at least in this area, did not start until the middle of December, and they would go from December through a late part of March.
[01:29:12.292 --> 01:29:14.614]  This year, they started a little bit earlier.
[01:29:14.634 --> 01:29:19.598]  They started in the early part of November, and it was on my television show the other night.
[01:29:20.198 --> 01:29:25.842]  I was telling the people, I play a little golf, and I was at this driving range, and there were about 40 people hitting golf balls.
[01:29:25.922 --> 01:29:27.624]  It was a completely clear day.
[01:29:28.234 --> 01:29:31.256]  And I looked up and I saw one of these white jets going through.
[01:29:31.276 --> 01:29:33.077]  Tell you what, let's hear the story after the break.
[01:29:33.598 --> 01:29:35.179]  Shelvin, anything else you want to add?
[01:29:36.159 --> 01:29:36.520]  Yeah.
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.340]  Okay, stay there.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.681]  You stay there too, please.
[01:29:39.101 --> 01:29:39.622]  We'll be back.
[01:29:39.682 --> 01:29:40.562]  Everybody stay with us.
[01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:44.445]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.945 --> 01:29:46.546]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.467 --> 01:29:50.169]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.778 --> 01:29:56.661]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[01:29:56.681 --> 01:29:58.682]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.

[01:30:04.568 --> 01:30:10.353]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.
[01:30:10.373 --> 01:30:12.915]  Well, I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.
[01:30:14.376 --> 01:30:15.557]  Not convinced yet?
[01:30:15.617 --> 01:30:19.680]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:38.191]  There are over 60,000 vendors waiting to save you money.
[01:30:38.451 --> 01:30:41.571]  All you need to do is visit vacationAtoZ.com.
[01:30:41.651 --> 01:30:46.713]  That's www.vacationA, the numeral 2, the letter Z, dot com.
[01:30:46.833 --> 01:30:50.753]  Visit today, and you can be saving big dollars tomorrow, even if you're not taking a vacation.
[01:30:54.554 --> 01:30:55.074]  Late summer 2003.
[01:30:56.455 --> 01:30:59.575]  Mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[01:30:59.975 --> 01:31:01.176]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[01:31:03.157 --> 01:31:06.018]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[01:31:06.398 --> 01:31:13.541]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[01:31:14.041 --> 01:31:14.941]  That's recovery?
[01:31:15.542 --> 01:31:20.764]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[01:31:21.164 --> 01:31:22.744]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[01:31:23.405 --> 01:31:26.186]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[01:31:30.847 --> 01:31:32.408]  I love the sound of real money.
[01:31:32.836 --> 01:31:38.179]  Call your representative today at Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:31:38.599 --> 01:31:43.181]  Learn how to protect your assets with real wealth, not potentially worthless paper.

[01:31:44.441 --> 01:31:44.622]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:31:52.316 --> 01:31:58.600]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[01:31:58.981 --> 01:32:03.063]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[01:32:03.564 --> 01:32:10.789]  Only recently has science discovered that maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[01:32:11.309 --> 01:32:28.364]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels, increased libido, which helps prevent impotence, relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort, helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[01:32:28.684 --> 01:32:31.646]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[01:32:32.106 --> 01:32:40.272]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[01:32:40.712 --> 01:32:42.213]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings.
[01:32:42.253 --> 01:32:44.015]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at CliffScott.com.
[01:33:07.474 --> 01:33:12.558]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:33:12.618 --> 01:33:14.120]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:16.902]  George Humphreys riding shotgun with us into the next hour.
[01:33:18.163 --> 01:33:24.109]  There's so much news and info to cover, but going back to Sheldon in Arizona and back to George.
[01:33:25.095 --> 01:33:26.196]  George, you were continuing.
[01:33:26.216 --> 01:33:27.517]  You're out there playing golf.
[01:33:27.617 --> 01:33:39.627]  Yeah, I was out there hitting the golf balls, and I look up, and within about 20 minutes, these four jets had made six vertical crosses and four horizontal crosses.
[01:33:40.788 --> 01:33:50.797]  And, of course, these jets are using the JP8 jet fuel, and what they've got is that they add this additive called ethylenedibromide, or EDB.
[01:33:52.262 --> 01:33:54.623]  And that is what is the difference.
[01:33:54.823 --> 01:34:05.686]  That is one of the additives that is keeping the contrail, turning the contrail into a chemtrail and making it more spider-like and keeping it together.
[01:34:06.226 --> 01:34:17.709]  And ethylenedibromide in 1983 was banned as an extremely toxic chemical, and yet they're adding it right now.
[01:34:17.869 --> 01:34:19.410]  Now, it must be noted...
[01:34:20.054 --> 01:34:35.079]  That this is not even that secret, what's going on, because on April 5, 2001, the Senate voted $4.5, not million, but billion dollars to restore funds for climate change programs.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.680]  And that's what they're doing here.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:44.883]  I mean, I don't know if it's specifically for climate change or exactly what the reason is, but the funding...
[01:34:46.649 --> 01:34:56.173]  $4.5 billion on April 5, 2001 for this program of putting the ethylene dibromide into the JP8 jet fuel.
[01:34:56.313 --> 01:34:57.793]  And let me add something to this.
[01:34:57.833 --> 01:34:58.113]  Yeah.
[01:34:59.534 --> 01:35:01.955]  Five, six years ago, jets would fly over 25, 30,000, 35,000 feet.
[01:35:03.075 --> 01:35:03.855]  They would leave a trail.
[01:35:03.875 --> 01:35:05.276]  It would disappear in a minute or two maximum.
[01:35:09.802 --> 01:35:10.243]  I think so.
[01:35:33.442 --> 01:35:38.386]  Spots where it turns on and off, the jet turns around again, does it again, does it again.
[01:35:38.426 --> 01:35:41.348]  I've watched the jet turn around five, six times before.
[01:35:42.028 --> 01:35:49.133]  I've watched groups of jets, large passenger type jetliners, usually white, flying right next to other jets that aren't leaving trails.
[01:35:51.362 --> 01:35:52.503]  You mentioned climate change.
[01:35:52.523 --> 01:35:59.345]  You probably weren't listening during the first hour before we got you on, but Earth is 20% darker, says experts, London Guardian.
[01:35:59.745 --> 01:36:02.626]  Human activity is making the planet darker as well as warmer.
[01:36:02.646 --> 01:36:07.167]  Scientists say they believe levels of sunlight reaching Earth's surface have declined by up to 20% in recent years.
[01:36:09.409 --> 01:36:20.771]  Because if air pollution is reflecting it back into space and helping to make bigger, longer-lasting clouds, the global dimming effect could have implications for everything from effectiveness of solar power to the growth of plants and trees.
[01:36:21.647 --> 01:36:33.952]  Over the past couple of years, it's become clear that the solar irradiance of the Earth's surface has decreased, said Jim Hansen, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Science in New York.
[01:36:34.292 --> 01:36:43.775]  Experts say global dimming is probably due to tiny particles such as soot and chemical compounds such as sulfates accumulating in the atmosphere.
[01:36:44.176 --> 01:36:50.118]  Data from 100 stations around the world show the amount of black carbon in the atmosphere is twice as big
[01:36:50.818 --> 01:36:53.839]  As we assumed, said Dr. Hanson.
[01:36:53.859 --> 01:36:54.659]  Now let me add this.
[01:36:56.059 --> 01:36:57.359]  I've looked at the other statistics.
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:02.481]  The major power plants, the coal plants, all of them have the scrubbers.
[01:37:02.501 --> 01:37:03.341]  They're much cleaner.
[01:37:03.361 --> 01:37:16.383]  When I was a young man, when I was a child, driving into Dallas or Fort Worth or Houston or San Antonio, that haze, the dust, it was so dusty back in the 40s and 50s that people had to wear masks.
[01:37:16.443 --> 01:37:17.424]  The skies were black.
[01:37:17.444 --> 01:37:18.844]  There's all those old photos of that.
[01:37:19.424 --> 01:37:21.565]  The air is actually a lot cleaner.
[01:37:21.605 --> 01:37:22.926]  The cars are a lot cleaner.
[01:37:22.986 --> 01:37:25.647]  Folks, you remember getting sick driving in traffic, you know, 20 years ago?
[01:37:26.127 --> 01:37:26.747]  Not now.
[01:37:27.148 --> 01:37:31.530]  So that's actually all down, but suddenly there's these particulates causing this.
[01:37:31.570 --> 01:37:32.250]  Go ahead, George.
[01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:47.357]  Well, what you're describing, it's almost funny, because what we're following... I know you've seen the movie The Matrix, and the reason the humans had to go underground is because they contaminated the sky...
[01:37:48.185 --> 01:37:49.968]  And it couldn't get enough sunlight.
[01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:56.663]  And we are either intentionally or unintentionally, as a human race,
[01:37:57.259 --> 01:38:00.881]  Really doing some very, very significant things to our atmosphere.
[01:38:00.981 --> 01:38:09.304]  Well, in the Matrix compilation animation they put out, what's the name of it?
[01:38:09.684 --> 01:38:10.345]  Animatrix.
[01:38:10.725 --> 01:38:10.965]  Yeah.
[01:38:11.725 --> 01:38:15.527]  In that, it shows the jets flying, spraying the chemtrails.
[01:38:15.787 --> 01:38:16.507]  Yep.
[01:38:16.648 --> 01:38:20.929]  And, friends, we're laughing about this, but this is...
[01:38:22.984 --> 01:38:24.826]  This is extremely serious.
[01:38:25.406 --> 01:38:45.944]  Our government, for whatever reasons, whether it's for HAARP or weather modification or for something else, has partaken and started a major program of spraying ethylenedibromide and other additives on the people of our own country.
[01:38:46.385 --> 01:38:49.908]  And every time they do it, within days afterwards,
[01:38:50.948 --> 01:38:59.596]  Not one or two or dozens or hundreds, but thousands and thousands of people in our area come down with an upper respiratory sickness.
[01:39:00.036 --> 01:39:01.257]  And this is not a joke.
[01:39:01.297 --> 01:39:02.799]  It's happening all over the country.
[01:39:02.859 --> 01:39:07.363]  It's happening in Australia, New Zealand, Spain, France, and England.
[01:39:07.423 --> 01:39:16.873]  Well, George, for folks that say they wouldn't do this, I have hundreds of news articles where they've done thousands of high-altitude, low-altitude radiation, chemical, biological spraying.
[01:39:17.093 --> 01:39:20.096]  They killed troops as late as 85 in Project Shad.
[01:39:20.397 --> 01:39:23.159]  They'd have them stand out in the field in England and fly over and spray them.
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:24.801]  That's the BBC.
[01:39:25.582 --> 01:39:29.286]  And it is some type of massive program, a 20% dimming program.
[01:39:30.687 --> 01:39:33.629]  I mean, I remember growing up, it was blue skies, it was happy, it was great.
[01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:35.910]  You never hardly see the blue skies anymore.
[01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:39.252]  It's nothing but these trails everywhere, George.
[01:39:39.993 --> 01:39:48.118]  Well, the only thing that's going to stop it is, number one, is getting information with discernment.
[01:39:48.138 --> 01:39:50.639]  We have to be very careful about our information.
[01:39:50.959 --> 01:39:59.064]  We have to get our information, and then we have to go and demand, not ask, but demand from our representatives that,
[01:39:59.879 --> 01:40:17.873]  Local, state, and national, that they become aware of this, and if they don't do this, I mean, we are in such a precarious situation right now, Alex, because as on all of my shows, I go to India quite often, and I study Mahatma Gandhi.
[01:40:18.374 --> 01:40:28.882]  I've stayed at his home, and I've studied his teachings, and I sincerely believe in nonviolent disobedience and ways of changing things.
[01:40:29.622 --> 01:40:40.405]  What is happening right now is so serious is that there are a lot of people who don't have the patience or the spiritual or the heart energy.
[01:40:40.985 --> 01:40:45.087]  And if things are not changed, there is probably going to be some violence.
[01:40:45.207 --> 01:40:47.808]  And that is not for our best interest.
[01:40:49.884 --> 01:40:54.768]  Well, that's the game they play.
[01:40:55.408 --> 01:40:59.951]  But certainly, George, I've heard you say that it comes down to them trying to kill your family you've got to defend.
[01:41:00.232 --> 01:41:01.012]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:41:01.052 --> 01:41:06.196]  There's no question that we have to keep all the families out there need to arm themselves.
[01:41:06.236 --> 01:41:07.257]  That is just common sense.
[01:41:09.602 --> 01:41:10.922]  We're good to go.
[01:41:26.188 --> 01:41:39.197]  Well, the real revolution is 400-plus cities and four states throwing out the Patriot Act and people, 92%, knowing that the government killed Kennedy now.
[01:41:39.878 --> 01:41:42.720]  Let's go back to the callers.
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:45.722]  A finish-up caller from Arizona, Shelvin.
[01:41:46.463 --> 01:41:46.723]  Yeah.
[01:41:49.591 --> 01:41:52.212]  I'm trying to print something off your website, Alex.
[01:41:52.352 --> 01:41:56.033]  It's forced inoculations at some Colorado school district.
[01:41:56.093 --> 01:41:58.073]  I think it's Weld County, Colorado.
[01:41:58.114 --> 01:41:59.654]  It's a three- or four-page document.
[01:41:59.694 --> 01:41:59.974]  Yes.
[01:41:59.994 --> 01:42:03.695]  I had great difficulties trying to print this out.
[01:42:03.835 --> 01:42:05.055]  Well, I print it all the time.
[01:42:05.215 --> 01:42:06.796]  Just your printer may be having a problem.
[01:42:07.456 --> 01:42:11.177]  I went to the law library two different days, and it just won't let me print it out.
[01:42:11.317 --> 01:42:12.918]  Well, you need to get a librarian to help you.
[01:42:14.018 --> 01:42:16.619]  Okay, and I appreciate the books here.
[01:42:17.259 --> 01:42:18.059]  I got out George...
[01:42:19.094 --> 01:42:19.774]  I'm free.
[01:42:19.955 --> 01:42:23.896]  There's a guy out there in Benson distributing them, and I got a copy of two of them.
[01:42:23.936 --> 01:42:24.917]  They're excellent work.
[01:42:25.537 --> 01:42:25.897]  All right.
[01:42:25.957 --> 01:42:27.078]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[01:42:28.238 --> 01:42:32.400]  Just as a footnote to what he's talking about, the vaccines, U.S.
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:41.424]  Congressman Burton just came out and said he would never take a flu vaccine because it is a proven, objectable fact.
[01:42:42.173 --> 01:42:45.195]  That there is mercury in the filler.
[01:42:45.375 --> 01:42:46.155]  There still is.
[01:42:46.475 --> 01:42:47.276]  The thimerosal.
[01:42:47.656 --> 01:42:53.920]  Dr. Geyer is the scientist from John Hopkins that he sent in there, forced the CDC to let him in.
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:43:00.183]  By your baby's first round of shots, they're 39 times above safe level of mercury for their weight.
[01:43:00.423 --> 01:43:05.446]  By the second round, it is 169 times.
[01:43:06.307 --> 01:43:08.468]  And that's if your baby's normal weight, folks...
[01:43:09.511 --> 01:43:13.168]  And the vaccines still have it in there, not to mention all the other garbage.
[01:43:14.013 --> 01:43:17.754]  Yeah, and this is something that Americans have to wake up to.
[01:43:18.054 --> 01:43:29.118]  First of all, the flu vaccine only represents about 3% of the shot, and it's not even sure that that vaccine will match up with the type of flu that is going around.
[01:43:29.198 --> 01:43:32.639]  They're admitting that this is last year's shot, doesn't even cover this new flu.
[01:43:32.999 --> 01:43:33.339]  Correct.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:41.782]  But the real problem is the 97% filler, and the mercury in the filler is the real kicker.
[01:43:43.178 --> 01:43:45.619]  And folks, it destroys brain development.
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:48.080]  Dr. Geyer was going over the numbers.
[01:43:48.121 --> 01:43:49.241]  These are the government's own numbers.
[01:43:50.182 --> 01:43:53.263]  25 years ago, it was 1 out of 20-plus thousand had autism.
[01:43:53.283 --> 01:43:56.405]  And then 15 years ago, it was 1 out of 2,500.
[01:43:56.445 --> 01:43:58.986]  And then about 8 years ago, it was about 1 out of 200.
[01:43:59.026 --> 01:43:59.726]  Guess what it is now?
[01:43:59.746 --> 01:44:00.266]  1 out of 100, George!
[01:44:00.286 --> 01:44:01.227]  You know, it's just...
[01:44:12.355 --> 01:44:14.076]  This is criminal.
[01:44:14.656 --> 01:44:23.941]  And if guys like you and I can figure this out, but it's not just like you and I. All over the country, good people are becoming aware of this objective information.
[01:44:24.401 --> 01:44:34.146]  And so these large corporations, they're not millions, but they're hundreds of millions, absolutely know what's going on, and they are pushing these poisons.
[01:44:34.907 --> 01:44:46.327]  Well, look, in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and he got all that from his brother, Julian Huxley, the big eugenics person, the first head of UNESCO for the U.N.,
[01:44:47.239 --> 01:44:49.200]  They would x-ray the eggs.
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:50.481]  They would x-ray the embryos.
[01:44:50.501 --> 01:44:52.542]  They would dumb down the servant class.
[01:44:53.403 --> 01:44:54.964]  And, you know, you look at David Rockefeller.
[01:44:55.784 --> 01:44:57.465]  You look at Jay Rockefeller, the senator.
[01:44:57.745 --> 01:44:58.846]  They're health food nuts.
[01:44:58.906 --> 01:45:00.407]  They won't take vaccines.
[01:45:01.528 --> 01:45:03.329]  They're real selective about what they'll eat.
[01:45:03.369 --> 01:45:04.669]  They filter all their water.
[01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:05.790]  This is well-known, folks.
[01:45:06.971 --> 01:45:08.412]  Which is smart on their part.
[01:45:08.492 --> 01:45:12.474]  And those are the things that we, as sovereign citizens...
[01:45:12.944 --> 01:45:20.750]  We should be eating organic foods, no GMOs, no genetically modified, no food irritation.
[01:45:21.130 --> 01:45:23.712]  We need to be eating clean food, clean water.
[01:45:23.732 --> 01:45:26.874]  Hey, what's wrong with irradiating the school food with radiation?
[01:45:27.234 --> 01:45:30.897]  Now we can feed them rotten beef, rotten poultry, rotten pork.
[01:45:30.957 --> 01:45:32.097]  Let's go quick to the calls.
[01:45:32.358 --> 01:45:33.358]  Question or comment, folks?
[01:45:34.059 --> 01:45:34.819]  I've got to get to everybody.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.641]  TJ in Minnesota, go ahead.
[01:45:36.661 --> 01:45:37.121]  You're on the air.
[01:45:37.441 --> 01:45:39.323]  Alex, I'll talk as fast as I can.
[01:45:39.363 --> 01:45:46.208]  I never expected to make a call to you again because we got jammed off your AM affiliates the last time I tried talking about spray planes.
[01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:47.609]  I want to thank you.
[01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:55.636]  I think you've turned a career corner or a vocational corner or a pro-life corner in your career today by having this man on.
[01:45:56.116 --> 01:46:00.099]  But most especially because you're talking about spray planes, av spray.
[01:46:00.119 --> 01:46:05.984]  Let's throw this chemtrail demonized word out the window and talk real military science.
[01:46:06.488 --> 01:46:07.049]  We're good to go.
[01:46:07.069 --> 01:46:07.250]  I think?
[01:46:19.386 --> 01:46:22.028]  That knows that he's being sprayed.
[01:46:22.108 --> 01:46:23.249]  Sir, sir, sir.
[01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:25.310]  I've had Clifford Carnicom on.
[01:46:25.950 --> 01:46:28.552]  I've had George Humphrey on probably, I don't know, ten times.
[01:46:28.632 --> 01:46:30.494]  Make it a primary target, Alex.
[01:46:30.654 --> 01:46:32.255]  Make it the primary target.
[01:46:32.295 --> 01:46:34.896]  You can only have one primary target.
[01:46:34.977 --> 01:46:44.543]  And knowledge is not power unless the governors of our sovereign states take action to get these aircraft out of our airspace.
[01:46:44.623 --> 01:46:45.544]  And God bless you.
[01:46:46.064 --> 01:46:47.185]  You're back on the...
[01:46:48.806 --> 01:46:50.327]  The white guy list.
[01:46:51.127 --> 01:46:52.388]  The white star list.
[01:46:52.528 --> 01:46:55.269]  The good guy list for what you've done this morning.
[01:46:55.369 --> 01:46:56.729]  I really appreciate it.
[01:46:56.770 --> 01:47:01.692]  Well, I mean, I cover chemtrails and the bill, the legislation in Road to Tyranny, sir.
[01:47:02.572 --> 01:47:03.252]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:04.253 --> 01:47:06.694]  Let's... You just need to tune in more.
[01:47:07.594 --> 01:47:10.335]  Let's talk to Wyatt Maryland.
[01:47:10.415 --> 01:47:11.236]  Wyatt, you're on the air.
[01:47:11.276 --> 01:47:11.676]  Go ahead.
[01:47:11.876 --> 01:47:12.556]  Hi, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:47:12.576 --> 01:47:13.417]  Good afternoon, George.
[01:47:13.957 --> 01:47:14.137]  Hey.
[01:47:14.757 --> 01:47:18.039]  Back, Alex, I called you last Thursday on the 11th, and...
[01:47:18.905 --> 01:47:23.307]  Talked about a person I had spoken with that worked in the Pentagon in the Defense Department.
[01:47:24.408 --> 01:47:26.950]  And on the 8th, I had that conversation.
[01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:29.911]  I'm only off on Thursdays, so that's the reason I can call you today.
[01:47:30.572 --> 01:47:39.136]  And, of course, on the 13th, the reports that gobbled up the news, the Sunday talk shows were on about Saddam Hussein.
[01:47:39.597 --> 01:47:47.261]  Well, one thing I forgot to tell you, or it didn't dawn on me to tell you this, that also in the conversation with this person from the Defense Department,
[01:47:48.397 --> 01:47:48.938]  We're good to go.
[01:48:04.491 --> 01:48:11.854]  And, of course, Sunday when that happened, that dawned on me that that person... Well, I just want to say, I know Wyatt sent me the footage.
[01:48:11.874 --> 01:48:17.196]  It's in Police State 2000 of the Marine Corps Hebron, Maryland, takeover, ten minutes of that two-hour film.
[01:48:17.936 --> 01:48:19.096]  And you did cover that.
[01:48:19.156 --> 01:48:22.918]  I mean, we have Albright saying that they already had these people.
[01:48:23.758 --> 01:48:28.760]  We have Congressman LaHood, a Republican, saying it December 2nd.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:33.702]  We have Tommy Franks saying we're about to give you Saddam in this month's Cigar Aficionado.
[01:48:34.862 --> 01:48:41.083]  Out four weeks before the announcement, because it comes out a month early, a lot of amazing stuff happening.
[01:48:41.123 --> 01:48:41.883]  George, comments?
[01:48:42.944 --> 01:48:56.886]  Well, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in a letter to Colonel Edward Mandel House in 1931, he said, as you and I both know, nothing happens in this country without the power elite being in control of it.
[01:48:57.706 --> 01:49:02.547]  And what is happening in Iraq is nothing but theater.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:06.203]  The timing of this and the passage of H.R.
[01:49:06.223 --> 01:49:07.544]  2417 is not a coincidence.
[01:49:07.764 --> 01:49:08.605]  It is just amazing.
[01:49:27.992 --> 01:49:29.933]  We're good to go.
[01:49:30.073 --> 01:49:30.333]  I think?
[01:49:49.611 --> 01:49:53.154]  A person back in the 50s and the 60s.
[01:49:53.614 --> 01:49:58.297]  He's been a useful tool of the CIA back in the 70s and the 80s.
[01:49:58.858 --> 01:50:05.182]  He was captured, and the fact is that we cannot win this war in Iraq.
[01:50:05.282 --> 01:50:08.264]  We can kill tens of thousands of Iraqis.
[01:50:08.304 --> 01:50:15.229]  We can put our uranium-enriched shells around there and make that an ecological nightmare.
[01:50:15.689 --> 01:50:22.532]  We can do all of these tyrannical things, and I travel in the Middle East all the time.
[01:50:23.213 --> 01:50:29.596]  What we have done is that we have unified diverse cultures of Islamic peoples.
[01:50:29.836 --> 01:50:38.100]  Well, George, we've got to break, but that's what P2OG two years ago, Rumsfeld's own Pentagon body, is to make them attack us.
[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:39.681]  This is Rumsfeld saying it.
[01:50:40.281 --> 01:50:41.281]  They want to unify them.
[01:50:41.301 --> 01:50:42.542]  They want World War III.
[01:50:43.282 --> 01:50:44.803]  They want to get them to do stupid stuff.
[01:50:45.538 --> 01:50:50.621]  That's why the Washington Post reported that our government ships in the Hadiths, the radical Muslim stuff.
[01:50:51.161 --> 01:50:51.641]  We'll be back.
[01:50:54.202 --> 01:50:57.084]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:50:57.797 --> 01:50:59.098]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:50:59.298 --> 01:51:05.043]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:51:05.323 --> 01:51:10.587]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:51:10.867 --> 01:51:15.011]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:51:15.191 --> 01:51:18.994]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:51:19.234 --> 01:51:23.898]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:51:23.958 --> 01:51:26.700]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:30.201]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:51:30.241 --> 01:51:32.122]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:51:32.562 --> 01:51:34.642]  Order 911 The Road to Tyranny today.
[01:51:34.722 --> 01:51:39.004]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:39.084 --> 01:51:39.664]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:40.604 --> 01:51:46.246]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:48.387]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[01:51:48.607 --> 01:51:50.127]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:51:50.287 --> 01:51:52.348]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:51:53.169 --> 01:51:56.432]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:51:56.512 --> 01:52:00.655]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:52:00.935 --> 01:52:03.718]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:52:03.918 --> 01:52:06.320]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:15.167]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:52:15.347 --> 01:52:16.708]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:52:16.889 --> 01:52:21.132]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:52:21.372 --> 01:52:23.093]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:52:23.333 --> 01:52:35.301]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:52:35.481 --> 01:52:41.985]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:52:42.245 --> 01:52:43.566]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:52:54.009 --> 01:52:58.714]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:52:58.874 --> 01:52:59.474]  Yes, it's true.
[01:52:59.494 --> 01:53:02.257]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:53:02.377 --> 01:53:06.361]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:53:06.441 --> 01:53:07.041]  You heard it right.
[01:53:07.181 --> 01:53:12.146]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:53:12.246 --> 01:53:13.267]  The list goes on and on.
[01:53:13.527 --> 01:53:14.468]  You may miss out forever.
[01:53:30.316 --> 01:53:30.716]  We're good to go.
[01:53:56.710 --> 01:54:01.134]  We're about to go to Jay and Tony and Ben and Elizabeth and Spencer and others.
[01:54:01.634 --> 01:54:04.376]  George Humphrey's going to ride shotgun with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:54:04.396 --> 01:54:07.579]  Got a lot of news we have not gotten to yet.
[01:54:07.619 --> 01:54:09.140]  We have covered a lot of the key stuff.
[01:54:10.181 --> 01:54:15.986]  Before we go back to George Humphrey and our callers, I do want to encourage every listener out there to get my documentary films.
[01:54:16.446 --> 01:54:19.329]  They're the best tools we've found to wake people up.
[01:54:19.509 --> 01:54:20.930]  Matrix of Evil's the newest.
[01:54:21.811 --> 01:54:23.512]  Police State's Retotal Enslavement.
[01:54:24.275 --> 01:54:29.121]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:31.183 --> 01:54:35.308]  If you'll get the videos and make 10, 15, 20 copies, it's easy to do.
[01:54:35.368 --> 01:54:36.430]  Just make a copy every day.
[01:54:37.364 --> 01:54:41.287]  And give them to public officials, opinion makers, talk show hosts, your pastors.
[01:54:41.807 --> 01:54:43.488]  A lot of people are waking up.
[01:54:43.588 --> 01:54:49.572]  I've never seen people's minds so open to the truth because the New World Order is hidden in plain sight.
[01:54:49.732 --> 01:54:52.454]  All we're doing is showing them the hidden picture.
[01:54:52.614 --> 01:55:01.440]  You know, those little things for children where there's a pattern that has a picture hidden in it and once they see it, they never understand how they could have missed it.
[01:55:02.741 --> 01:55:04.362]  Well, that's how the New World Order works.
[01:55:04.422 --> 01:55:06.183]  We're just shifting your perspective
[01:55:07.046 --> 01:55:10.509]  Just a little bit, and then suddenly it's so clear.
[01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:21.339]  Ever been looking at a natural structure, you can't tell where it is at a distance, and then as you turn around a corner and see it from another angle, it's so obvious, you're going to go, how did I not recognize that?
[01:55:22.396 --> 01:55:23.878]  Folks, you need to get my videos.
[01:55:23.898 --> 01:55:26.180]  They're all over two hours long, $25.95.
[01:55:27.141 --> 01:55:29.063]  They're indescribable, the information that's in them.
[01:55:29.083 --> 01:55:29.804]  You need to have them.
[01:55:30.384 --> 01:55:31.686]  Get three or more of the titles.
[01:55:31.706 --> 01:55:33.007]  They drop down to $20.
[01:55:33.047 --> 01:55:37.591]  Get Paul Watson's new book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order.
[01:55:37.932 --> 01:55:39.313]  Get my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:55:39.393 --> 01:55:40.775]  It gets into the chemtrails, by the way.
[01:55:41.575 --> 01:55:47.458]  1-888-253-3139 is the number.
[01:55:47.498 --> 01:55:48.318]  Write it down, folks.
[01:55:48.798 --> 01:55:50.239]  Make the call.
[01:55:50.259 --> 01:56:04.764]  1-888-253-3139 or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order via our secure online shopping cart or just write to me, and I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:56:04.804 --> 01:56:05.365]  Also carry a
[01:56:11.827 --> 01:56:14.408]  The two books, well, the three books that George Humphrey's written.
[01:56:14.848 --> 01:56:17.248]  I carry the audio books to those on CD and tape.
[01:56:17.328 --> 01:56:18.309]  I carry his booklets.
[01:56:19.229 --> 01:56:21.909]  I carry his materials also on the website at the toll-free number.
[01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:25.130]  But if folks want to get those directly from you, George, how do they do it?
[01:56:26.010 --> 01:56:29.191]  They write Common Sense at P.O.
[01:56:29.231 --> 01:56:29.871]  Box 5772, P.O.
[01:56:29.891 --> 01:56:30.792]  Box 5772, Austin, Texas 78763.
[01:56:38.072 --> 01:56:42.157]  And you can either get them from me or you can get them from Alex's website.
[01:56:42.237 --> 01:56:50.026]  I've got an introductory book called Common Sense, which is great for giving people who are brand... It's an introduction to New World Order.
[01:56:50.507 --> 01:56:55.953]  And then I've got a more advanced book called Uncommon Sense, Your Choice, the Blue Pill or the Red Pill.
[01:56:56.753 --> 01:57:01.515]  And then I've got a third booklet that's called 911, The Great Illusion.
[01:57:01.915 --> 01:57:08.597]  Now, the good thing about these booklets and these tapes, these booklets are all between 65 to 70 pages.
[01:57:08.637 --> 01:57:10.158]  They're easy to read.
[01:57:10.538 --> 01:57:11.738]  They've got pictures.
[01:57:12.399 --> 01:57:13.859]  They're understandable.
[01:57:13.879 --> 01:57:16.240]  The latest book is color.
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:17.620]  Yeah, it's all color.
[01:57:18.541 --> 01:57:20.261]  The third one has got color.
[01:57:20.301 --> 01:57:22.002]  It's got over 40 pictures in it.
[01:57:22.666 --> 01:57:27.108]  And clearly these rascals went too far with 911.
[01:57:28.169 --> 01:57:30.290]  It is so easy to figure out.
[01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:41.996]  And if you can show your friends that 911 was a great illusion, it was absolutely a Hegelian event.
[01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:43.180]  We're good to go.
[01:58:04.713 --> 01:58:05.394]  We're good to go.
[01:58:21.730 --> 01:58:23.372]  And they're a great gift.
[01:58:23.412 --> 01:58:26.916]  So either get them from Alex or me, but give them to your friends.
[01:58:27.316 --> 01:58:35.165]  And every single day we get letters from people saying, I gave this to my uncle or my brother or my sister.
[01:58:35.185 --> 01:58:36.266]  They didn't believe it.
[01:58:36.286 --> 01:58:37.187]  Yeah, there's the hope.
[01:58:37.347 --> 01:58:40.050]  We're able to wake folks up, thanks to God.
[01:58:40.591 --> 01:58:41.852]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:58:41.892 --> 01:58:42.573]  More calls, more news.
[01:58:45.034 --> 01:58:49.516]  Through the years of providing water filters to America you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:58:49.876 --> 01:58:53.957]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:58:54.258 --> 01:58:54.798]  We listened.
[01:58:55.118 --> 01:59:00.100]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:00.860]  We listened.
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:04.281]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:59:04.701 --> 01:59:05.242]  We listened.
[01:59:05.702 --> 01:59:08.763]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:59:10.137 --> 01:59:10.617]  We listened.
[01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:16.219]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:59:16.619 --> 01:59:17.980]  Again, we listened.
[01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:25.722]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:59:26.102 --> 01:59:29.143]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259.
[01:59:36.051 --> 01:59:37.052]  We're good to go.
[01:59:37.112 --> 01:59:38.173]  We're good to go.
[02:00:05.615 --> 02:00:06.456]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.676 --> 02:00:15.962]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're now into the third and final hour of this Thursday, the 18th of December, 2003 Global Transmission.
[02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:33.978]  Coming up, more on Bush's enemy combatant designation being overturned for now, but Bush is ignoring the courts, by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:00:34.639 --> 02:00:37.062]  More on Patriot Act II being sneakily passed.
[02:00:37.663 --> 02:00:37.783]  U.S.
[02:00:37.843 --> 02:00:39.786]  urges citizens to leave Saudi Arabia.
[02:00:40.868 --> 02:00:41.748]  We're good to go.
[02:01:02.583 --> 02:01:08.387]  Writer and researcher and fighter of the New World Order, George Humphrey, right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:01:09.108 --> 02:01:14.552]  Let's go ahead and go to Jay in Colorado, then Tony, Ben, Elizabeth, and others.
[02:01:15.072 --> 02:01:16.133]  You're on the air, Jay.
[02:01:16.493 --> 02:01:17.214]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:01:17.454 --> 02:01:17.714]  Fine.
[02:01:17.734 --> 02:01:19.696]  I just want to say something about the chemtrails.
[02:01:19.716 --> 02:01:23.418]  First of all, I was down at the Air Force game down at Colorado Springs.
[02:01:23.539 --> 02:01:27.361]  They do flyovers by the dozens, really, wasting fuel.
[02:01:27.401 --> 02:01:30.904]  But anyway, I'm sitting there in the parking lot just flying towards
[02:01:31.383 --> 02:01:32.223]  And is this at about 1,000 feet?
[02:01:56.090 --> 02:01:56.912]  Oh, it's closer than that.
[02:01:56.932 --> 02:01:57.853]  They're doing flyovers.
[02:01:58.013 --> 02:02:03.462]  And again, condensation trails aren't supposed to form but above 25,000 feet generally.
[02:02:03.802 --> 02:02:08.971]  I'm watching planes every day at 3,000 feet spraying stuff that sits there for four hours.
[02:02:09.111 --> 02:02:09.712]  George Humphrey?
[02:02:11.152 --> 02:02:14.153]  Well, it's happening all over the country.
[02:02:14.213 --> 02:02:29.280]  In my last show, I had films of this that was happening in Austin, Texas last week, in which six different lines, four across and two came out, and we have the white jet, we have the films of it.
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:36.106]  And this is just one of hundreds of different films that I have seen on this.
[02:02:36.506 --> 02:02:43.553]  It's happening everywhere, and the only way to stop it is when people become aware, they look up, and then they take action.
[02:02:43.953 --> 02:02:46.215]  And again, it's like everything else with the New World Order.
[02:02:46.315 --> 02:02:47.576]  It's hidden in plain view.
[02:02:47.616 --> 02:02:51.300]  It's like autism from 1 in 20-something thousand to 1 in 100 in 20 years.
[02:02:53.718 --> 02:02:54.818]  It's hidden in plain view.
[02:02:54.879 --> 02:03:01.521]  The CDC admits, by a toddler's second round of shots, they have 160 times the safe level of mercury.
[02:03:01.841 --> 02:03:03.362]  That's the CDC.
[02:03:03.722 --> 02:03:06.543]  They put MBTE in all the fuel.
[02:03:07.123 --> 02:03:08.744]  49 states are contaminated.
[02:03:08.764 --> 02:03:12.265]  It's a deadly carcinogen, and they said put it in there for the environment.
[02:03:12.586 --> 02:03:18.608]  It's all hidden in plain view, but they'll take your ranch or farm under some phony environmental land grab, George.
[02:03:22.024 --> 02:03:25.229]  There are just so many battles for us to fight.
[02:03:26.304 --> 02:03:34.991]  And there are the environmental battles, there are the economic battles, there's the cultural battles, there's the media battles, there's the political battles.
[02:03:35.471 --> 02:03:40.115]  And all of us have, either we're part of the problem or part of the solution.
[02:03:40.776 --> 02:03:50.103]  And most people have their jobs, they can't be on the radio eight hours a day like you are, or researching this eight hours a day like I am.
[02:03:50.543 --> 02:03:55.127]  But everybody can do something, and so I really encourage everybody,
[02:03:55.627 --> 02:03:58.629]  Number one, get information with discernment.
[02:03:59.409 --> 02:04:00.950]  Share this with your friends.
[02:04:01.771 --> 02:04:06.213]  Say your prayers and ask God for guidance and take political action.
[02:04:07.054 --> 02:04:07.674]  Absolutely.
[02:04:08.074 --> 02:04:09.975]  Anything else there, Jay?
[02:04:10.296 --> 02:04:11.216]  Just a comment on that.
[02:04:11.256 --> 02:04:21.382]  I have a lot of college graduate open-thinking friends, not even political, that just don't have the time, they don't care.
[02:04:21.802 --> 02:04:23.423]  And they know what I say.
[02:04:23.443 --> 02:04:24.464]  They agree that I'm
[02:04:25.023 --> 02:04:25.664]  They need facts.
[02:04:25.804 --> 02:04:28.466]  They just say, well, I can't do anything about it.
[02:04:28.526 --> 02:04:30.628]  I'm going to live good while I can.
[02:04:30.648 --> 02:04:32.810]  Yeah, most people I see are awake to it now.
[02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:35.212]  It's a good point, Jay, but they're apathetic.
[02:04:35.932 --> 02:04:36.533]  But don't worry.
[02:04:36.553 --> 02:04:38.134]  The New World Order is our biggest recruiter.
[02:04:38.154 --> 02:04:41.737]  When they get squeezed properly, they'll decide to fight.
[02:04:42.078 --> 02:04:42.738]  Thanks for the call.
[02:04:42.758 --> 02:04:44.360]  We'll be back with more calls, more news.
[02:04:45.737 --> 02:04:50.000]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:54.603]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:54.763 --> 02:04:59.126]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:04:59.186 --> 02:05:00.507]  The New World Order.
[02:05:01.307 --> 02:05:01.608]  Can emerge.
[02:05:02.329 --> 02:05:06.533]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:06.593 --> 02:05:13.541]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:13.681 --> 02:05:15.664]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:16.044 --> 02:05:26.368]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:26.668 --> 02:05:32.010]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:05:32.530 --> 02:05:35.171]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[02:05:45.316 --> 02:05:49.977]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the ARC Institute.
[02:05:50.077 --> 02:05:56.959]  You'll get 25 big packets of ARC's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds plus four of their most popular self-reliance books.
[02:05:57.179 --> 02:05:59.699]  Learn how to grow your own delicious veggies and build your ARC.
[02:05:59.919 --> 02:06:05.080]  Imagine green beans, carrots, peas and cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, squash, herbs and more.
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:09.301]  Then harvest your seeds to grow year after year for old-time self-reliance.
[02:06:09.601 --> 02:06:13.322]  In Living Well on Wheat, learn how to cook, eat and survive on the golden grains.
[02:06:13.462 --> 02:06:14.163]  We're good to go.
[02:06:14.183 --> 02:06:14.663]  We're good to go.
[02:06:36.181 --> 02:06:38.243]  That's 800-255-1912 or send a money order for $69 to the ARC Institute, P.O.
[02:06:38.263 --> 02:06:39.164]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[02:06:45.206 --> 02:06:53.830]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:06:54.030 --> 02:07:05.316]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:07:05.536 --> 02:07:08.197]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:07:08.517 --> 02:07:12.619]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[02:07:12.739 --> 02:07:13.299]  We're good to go.
[02:07:37.811 --> 02:07:37.971]  803-4438.
[02:07:38.031 --> 02:07:42.274]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:07:42.354 --> 02:07:43.676]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:07:45.437 --> 02:07:50.462]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:50.842 --> 02:07:53.164]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:55.406 --> 02:08:01.171]  We've got about 51 minutes left in this Thursday global transmission against tyranny.
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:10.665]  And I am going to get into the latest developments with the Bush family being paid off by the Communist Chinese publicly for Bush to sell out Taiwan.
[02:08:10.685 --> 02:08:14.848]  Of course, his daddy was the ambassador when Nixon got China opened up.
[02:08:15.789 --> 02:08:18.151]  Now we've seen the destruction of our economy through that.
[02:08:18.571 --> 02:08:20.152]  That's coming up in a lot of other key news.
[02:08:20.172 --> 02:08:24.836]  We've got George Humphrey here with us, a former city council member, author, good friend of mine here in Austin.
[02:08:24.856 --> 02:08:27.838]  About another ten minutes or so, we've got to go ahead and go to these calls.
[02:08:28.778 --> 02:08:30.620]  Let's talk to Tony in Tennessee.
[02:08:30.740 --> 02:08:31.641]  Tony, you're on the air.
[02:08:31.681 --> 02:08:32.081]  Go ahead.
[02:08:32.702 --> 02:08:33.343]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[02:08:34.323 --> 02:08:36.845]  I wanted to discuss these chemtrails just a little bit.
[02:08:36.865 --> 02:08:38.006]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:08:38.487 --> 02:08:57.701]  I was listening to the John Steltmuller Show about two weeks ago now, on his Saturday show, you guys' show there, and he made the statement that down in Tampa, Florida, there were massive spraying going on, and a microbiologist went out and tested it and found the flu virus in it.
[02:08:59.302 --> 02:09:02.525]  And I waited all week, and I heard nobody discussing it
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:07.155]  So I called and I talked to John last Saturday, and he said, you're not going to hear no more about it.
[02:09:07.276 --> 02:09:08.701]  The guy's scared to death right now.
[02:09:10.214 --> 02:09:14.955]  Yeah, we've, he's been, again, the guy's afraid to come on the air.
[02:09:15.575 --> 02:09:17.156]  We've caught him in the past doing this.
[02:09:17.176 --> 02:09:27.178]  There's congressional studies going back 40 years where they would spray cold and flu virus in the ship channel in San Francisco, release stuff in the New York subway.
[02:09:27.238 --> 02:09:28.238]  It killed people.
[02:09:28.258 --> 02:09:32.239]  I mean, they do this all the time, so I don't put it past them, yes.
[02:09:32.839 --> 02:09:33.879]  Comments, George Humphrey.
[02:09:35.501 --> 02:09:50.278]  Well, there have been a tremendous amount of accusations and information about this, and I have heard this before, is that there is this microorganism in there and it's somewhere between a bacteria and a virus.
[02:09:51.323 --> 02:09:55.209]  That some people are alleging is within this.
[02:09:55.309 --> 02:09:56.410]  A microplasm.
[02:09:56.711 --> 02:10:02.199]  Yeah, and now I have heard this, and I have not gotten definitive information as there.
[02:10:02.219 --> 02:10:03.240]  Well, George, what I have...
[02:10:07.626 --> 02:10:12.870]  People in Austin, people in California, people in Virginia get sick.
[02:10:13.090 --> 02:10:16.353]  Well, what I have is the thousands of reports, the admitted U.S.
[02:10:16.373 --> 02:10:23.758]  government testing on troops and populations, headlines like flag bombs released off coast of Scotland, you know, stuff like that.
[02:10:24.039 --> 02:10:25.079]  Thanks for the call, Tony.
[02:10:25.099 --> 02:10:25.800]  Wait a minute, Alex.
[02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:26.280]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:26.981]  We're almost out of time.
[02:10:27.021 --> 02:10:30.463]  Yeah, sometimes, you know, I mean, we have to use our common sense.
[02:10:30.804 --> 02:10:35.007]  We can't completely prove things, but how would they know that it's going to hit all 50 states?
[02:10:35.891 --> 02:10:38.153]  And they couldn't shove the smallpox down our throats.
[02:10:38.753 --> 02:10:39.714]  So what are they doing now?
[02:10:39.854 --> 02:10:46.920]  They're creating hysteria over a lack of vaccinations, but they're coming up with them now, and people are lining up to get their mercury.
[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:47.421]  I hear you.
[02:10:47.461 --> 02:10:48.101]  Thanks for the call.
[02:10:49.282 --> 02:10:53.125]  Look, again, I have congressional reports.
[02:10:53.326 --> 02:10:54.086]  I have AP.
[02:10:54.226 --> 02:11:02.593]  I have BBC, where they admit they've done biological testing up in what's going on right now for the last eight months all over Oklahoma.
[02:11:02.633 --> 02:11:04.495]  I'm talking daily Oklahoma and Associated Press.
[02:11:05.345 --> 02:11:06.085]  TV stations.
[02:11:06.145 --> 02:11:06.946]  I have newscasts.
[02:11:06.966 --> 02:11:07.626]  Listeners have sent me.
[02:11:08.046 --> 02:11:14.909]  They're spraying thousands of pounds of Subtilis Globogy, a supposedly harmless bacteria.
[02:11:15.009 --> 02:11:16.890]  Oh, well, it can't hurt the old, the young, the infirm.
[02:11:17.853 --> 02:11:21.896]  And they're doing this with large crop dusters, thousands of pounds.
[02:11:21.936 --> 02:11:23.398]  So I have that too.
[02:11:23.938 --> 02:11:25.359]  George, you were aware of that, correct?
[02:11:25.739 --> 02:11:26.400]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:28.362]  So we do have cases of this.
[02:11:28.382 --> 02:11:29.402]  There is so much.
[02:11:29.482 --> 02:11:43.654]  There is this, as in your film, The Matrix of Evil, every single one of these issues that we've talked about, from genetically modified organisms to iridation to the chemicals in our food,
[02:11:44.284 --> 02:11:50.047]  Is that we could spend a full hour, two hours, three hours discussing this in detail.
[02:11:50.468 --> 02:11:51.468]  It's a deluge.
[02:11:52.189 --> 02:11:55.030]  Thank you for the last call.
[02:11:55.831 --> 02:12:00.473]  Let us now go to Ben in Rhode Island and Elizabeth, Dan, Don, Spencer.
[02:12:00.753 --> 02:12:02.294]  Go ahead, Ben, you're on the air.
[02:12:02.314 --> 02:12:04.516]  Hey, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:12:04.596 --> 02:12:05.156]  You bet.
[02:12:05.436 --> 02:12:08.098]  Thank you, George, for the information you're putting out.
[02:12:08.118 --> 02:12:10.419]  And I'm calling, Alex, because I need your help.
[02:12:10.999 --> 02:12:12.340]  I need to announce a meeting.
[02:12:13.056 --> 02:12:21.882]  Tonight at City Hall in Providence, the City Council is meeting for a vote on a resolution opposing the Patriot Act and other executive orders.
[02:12:22.502 --> 02:12:32.289]  And I just want to get the word out as much as I can that people need to show up, cancel their plans, become active, just like Mr. Humphries is talking about, just like you always talk about and do, Alex.
[02:12:32.909 --> 02:12:34.530]  And I just need as many people to show up.
[02:12:34.710 --> 02:12:36.651]  City Hall, Providence, I'll be there.
[02:12:36.711 --> 02:12:37.992]  My wife, my kids will be there.
[02:12:38.473 --> 02:12:40.694]  And we need to stand over these people like children, I guess,
[02:12:41.041 --> 02:12:42.242]  And make them do the right thing.
[02:12:42.282 --> 02:12:45.665]  But we need as big a turnout as possible so they can pass this resolution.
[02:12:45.946 --> 02:12:48.668]  Well, you ought to bring them the associated... Thank you, sir.
[02:12:48.728 --> 02:12:49.349]  God bless you.
[02:12:49.389 --> 02:12:51.231]  Tonight in Providence where we have a great affiliate.
[02:12:51.691 --> 02:12:55.395]  You need to take the AP article, Bush overruled on enemy combatant case.
[02:12:55.855 --> 02:13:02.081]  That's Patriot Act II being overruled, which they were already implementing before they passed it last weekend.
[02:13:02.581 --> 02:13:07.162]  So if that isn't enough for you, your city council needs to do that.
[02:13:07.222 --> 02:13:09.263]  Everybody needs to call them right now in Providence.
[02:13:09.843 --> 02:13:10.983]  Would you agree with that, George?
[02:13:11.943 --> 02:13:12.723]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:13:13.103 --> 02:13:16.024]  And for the fellow in Providence, I have a very dear friend.
[02:13:16.524 --> 02:13:18.064]  His name is Dick Gilbane.
[02:13:19.165 --> 02:13:19.965]  Give him a call.
[02:13:20.005 --> 02:13:21.605]  He's with Gilbane Construction.
[02:13:22.085 --> 02:13:24.766]  And if you can convince him, I think he has a lot of pull.
[02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:29.572]  With the Providence City Council, and he's a real good guy.
[02:13:29.852 --> 02:13:31.212]  All right.
[02:13:31.252 --> 02:13:33.093]  You know Karl Rove, too, don't you?
[02:13:33.553 --> 02:13:34.714]  Well, I know who he is.
[02:13:34.754 --> 02:13:36.114]  He used to live in my neighborhood.
[02:13:36.134 --> 02:13:37.435]  Yeah, and you were on the city council.
[02:13:37.455 --> 02:13:44.158]  Almost everybody in my neighborhood has been at times close personal friends with George Bush.
[02:13:45.316 --> 02:13:50.078]  You know, he's a likable guy, but, you know, as they all say, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed.
[02:13:50.198 --> 02:13:52.879]  Well, he's just a puppet, but, you know, George, you're a prominent guy.
[02:13:52.899 --> 02:13:54.759]  We need more prominent people fighting the globalists.
[02:13:54.819 --> 02:13:57.940]  A couple more calls, I'll let you go pick your son up from his finals.
[02:13:58.721 --> 02:14:02.722]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[02:14:02.762 --> 02:14:03.762]  Elizabeth, you're on the air.
[02:14:03.802 --> 02:14:04.243]  Go ahead.
[02:14:04.723 --> 02:14:10.725]  God bless you, Alex and George, for this mammoth show, bringing out the terrible evils.
[02:14:10.925 --> 02:14:14.166]  Actually, you're fighting the Beast, capital B, I believe.
[02:14:14.691 --> 02:14:32.977]  And you know, Alex, you encouraged me earlier to become a talk show host, and I want to make a tiny announcement that I am going to shortwave, and starting today at 3.30 to 4 o'clock, my little minuet after your symphony will be on on Thursdays, and last night after your show.
[02:14:33.519 --> 02:14:34.339]  We're good to go.
[02:14:34.359 --> 02:14:34.900]  We're good to go.
[02:14:58.769 --> 02:14:59.589]  Well, that's beautiful.
[02:14:59.629 --> 02:15:00.389]  Thank you, Elizabeth.
[02:15:00.409 --> 02:15:01.550]  Appreciate the call.
[02:15:02.330 --> 02:15:03.770]  Dan in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:04.271]  Go ahead.
[02:15:04.811 --> 02:15:05.651]  How you doing, Alex, George?
[02:15:05.991 --> 02:15:06.411]  Fine.
[02:15:06.851 --> 02:15:11.353]  You know, about 15 years ago, I ran a business in a gang neighborhood in Chicago.
[02:15:12.473 --> 02:15:19.395]  I went back and visited a couple of weeks ago, and they told me that this Jose Padilla was one of the people that used to hang around, and I didn't recognize him by name.
[02:15:20.335 --> 02:15:23.196]  When I saw his picture this morning, I didn't know exactly who he is.
[02:15:24.316 --> 02:15:26.617]  And they told me, no way in the world is this guy at all.
[02:15:27.569 --> 02:15:30.570]  Well, they say he's got an 81 IQ.
[02:15:30.630 --> 02:15:32.551]  That's one point above retarded.
[02:15:32.771 --> 02:15:33.511]  No, no way.
[02:15:34.251 --> 02:15:36.332]  This kid was quiet, but he was sharp.
[02:15:37.512 --> 02:15:38.072]  There's no way.
[02:15:38.252 --> 02:15:39.333]  I mean, you can just look at his picture.
[02:15:39.373 --> 02:15:40.653]  You can see he's not stupid.
[02:15:41.714 --> 02:15:49.016]  Yeah, well, I mean, look, he deserves the same rights as any American citizen in the Second Court of Appeals has said that.
[02:15:49.496 --> 02:15:52.557]  I mean, I don't remember him real close, but
[02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:58.362]  No way in the world is this, you know, they said themselves that he's not involved in any kind of terrorism at all.
[02:15:59.602 --> 02:16:03.643]  Comments on the enemy combatant designation, the secret snatch and grabs, George.
[02:16:06.364 --> 02:16:09.545]  You know, the question again comes down very simply.
[02:16:10.185 --> 02:16:16.287]  Do we want to be a republic and take care of the people in our communities, states, in our country?
[02:16:16.946 --> 02:16:17.467]  We're good to go.
[02:16:27.268 --> 02:16:34.070]  What's happened in Afghanistan, Sudan, Iraq, around the world, Bosnia?
[02:16:34.370 --> 02:16:36.110]  Has this helped the American people?
[02:16:36.310 --> 02:16:37.391]  No, of course it has not.
[02:16:37.411 --> 02:16:47.053]  Well, Governor Ridge says let's legalize all illegals and accept their fake ID cards, but let's put a microscope down the throat of every American citizen.
[02:16:48.953 --> 02:16:52.654]  Because you and I live right near the border of Mexico, we see this.
[02:16:53.094 --> 02:16:55.315]  It's in our face every single day.
[02:16:55.962 --> 02:17:02.708]  We have hundreds of thousands of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, but our borders are wide open.
[02:17:02.828 --> 02:17:10.716]  And if you look at the demographics of what is going on, our country is changing exponentially as we speak.
[02:17:10.996 --> 02:17:12.157]  To a third world nation.
[02:17:12.838 --> 02:17:16.321]  Finish up, Dan, because I've got to let our guest go.
[02:17:19.332 --> 02:17:21.673]  Okay, I think our caller went ahead and hung up.
[02:17:22.373 --> 02:17:27.515]  For John and Spencer and James, everybody else, we'll get to you here in the next segment into more news.
[02:17:27.855 --> 02:17:34.358]  George Humphrey, former city council member, successful businessman here in Austin, guy who does a local cable show, fighting the globalists, written books.
[02:17:35.138 --> 02:17:39.220]  I want to thank you for your insight and your great work, and I look forward to having you back up in the near future.
[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:42.041]  Well, Alex, it's always a joy to be on your show.
[02:17:42.281 --> 02:17:54.045]  I encourage the people who are listening to go to my new website, www.fearorlove.com, fearorlove.com, to visit your website to get my books, to get your tapes.
[02:17:54.325 --> 02:17:55.225]  Absolutely, George.
[02:17:55.245 --> 02:17:58.366]  You've been on for an hour and 18 minutes with us, and we haven't plugged that.
[02:17:58.386 --> 02:18:00.647]  www.fearorlove.org.
[02:18:01.047 --> 02:18:02.407]  Yeah, it's not finished yet.
[02:18:02.447 --> 02:18:06.969]  It's going to be a great website, but its bones are up.
[02:18:07.009 --> 02:18:07.969]  www.fearorlove.com.
[02:18:10.231 --> 02:18:22.904]  And I want to wish every single person the merriest and the most joyous Christmas possible and give all of your friends and family a big hug and have lots of love in your heart.
[02:18:23.264 --> 02:18:23.805]  Absolutely.
[02:18:23.845 --> 02:18:24.525]  Thanks for the call.
[02:18:24.546 --> 02:18:26.107]  I appreciate it.
[02:18:26.768 --> 02:18:27.108]  You bet.
[02:18:27.148 --> 02:18:27.789]  Take care, George.
[02:18:28.490 --> 02:18:46.660]  That's why they want to get control of our lives, because they hate families, they hate decency, they hate honor, and they've got their neocon liars all over the media who are for open borders, gun control, supercomputers to China, NAFTA, GATT, cutting Taiwan loose.
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:55.625]  They call this conservatism, and they sit up there and they lie and they twist every day, just as bad or worse as CNN or ABC News.
[02:18:56.613 --> 02:19:07.341]  And it's time for the conservative mass, the conservative majority out there, those that love freedom, to stop being mind-controlled by the neocons.
[02:19:07.381 --> 02:19:08.983]  And you know who I'm talking about.
[02:19:09.383 --> 02:19:14.647]  The people who get on the radio every day and say, put anybody in a camp that disagrees with the administration.
[02:19:15.488 --> 02:19:17.969]  They're on radio and TV saying that.
[02:19:18.010 --> 02:19:19.550]  They're talking about martial law.
[02:19:19.971 --> 02:19:21.311]  They're talking about camps.
[02:19:21.631 --> 02:19:23.072]  We're not going to put up with it.
[02:19:23.272 --> 02:19:28.695]  They can only succeed if we shut up and cower to them, and I'm not going to be part of it.
[02:19:29.155 --> 02:19:30.036]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:19:31.637 --> 02:19:33.878]  A ton of news and info coming up, and your calls.
[02:19:34.458 --> 02:19:35.939]  Wide open phones, 1-800-259-9231.

[02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:47.240]  You've searched for it.
[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:48.121]  We have it.
[02:19:48.281 --> 02:19:49.861]  I'm talking about Coral Calcium.

[02:23:50.595 --> 02:23:52.496]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:52.976 --> 02:23:55.796]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:57.997 --> 02:24:02.038]  I want to go back to a story here from a few months ago in the next segment.
[02:24:02.078 --> 02:24:04.759]  We take some calls about terror alerts manufactured.
[02:24:04.839 --> 02:24:09.840]  FBI agency, White House scripting hysterics for political effect just to show you how criminal this is.
[02:24:10.220 --> 02:24:13.181]  Then the Bushes involved with the communist Chinese.
[02:24:13.201 --> 02:24:15.021]  That's why Bush is selling Taiwan out.
[02:24:15.061 --> 02:24:16.742]  Wait to hear all the contracts they're getting.
[02:24:17.639 --> 02:24:18.420]  I think we're good to go.
[02:24:45.717 --> 02:24:53.881]  Waffen-SS Major Wernher von Braun ran the Apollo program with TR help from Walt Disney, as reported this week in Space.com.
[02:24:54.641 --> 02:25:04.466]  History Channel reported that von Braun and other NASA Nazis genocided 25,000 slaves in Hitler's underground ICBM rocket factory at Nordhausen.
[02:25:05.126 --> 02:25:07.908]  Now NASA buys its rockets from Russia and Kami, China.
[02:25:08.708 --> 02:25:12.070]  Over a dozen astronauts died violent deaths during the Apollo program.
[02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:15.011]  NASA spokesman Brian Welch died of a heart attack
[02:25:15.663 --> 02:25:16.083]  We're good to go.
[02:25:43.618 --> 02:25:44.318]  We're good to go.
[02:25:44.338 --> 02:25:44.478]  I think?
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:17.023]  Holding up the astronauts to simulate 1-6 gravity.
[02:26:18.264 --> 02:26:29.353]  And finally, astronaut Freemason Colonel Buzz Aldrin was videotaped punching a reporter in the face when Bart Sobrell asked him to swear in a Bible that he walked on the moon.
[02:26:29.373 --> 02:26:33.956]  So these are great distractions for a United Nations corporation war like the Vietnam War.
[02:26:34.437 --> 02:26:36.478]  So you better watch your wallet and watch for the draft.
[02:26:37.279 --> 02:26:42.583]  Well, Ron Paul is saying they're getting ready for a draft and interesting questions you raised.
[02:26:42.623 --> 02:26:43.244]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:44.542 --> 02:26:46.324]  Let's talk to Spencer in Ohio.
[02:26:46.384 --> 02:26:47.365]  Spencer, you're on the air.
[02:26:47.445 --> 02:26:47.905]  Go ahead.
[02:26:48.165 --> 02:26:48.606]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:48.686 --> 02:26:54.171]  Alex, just like Bill Kasting said on the Fox conspiracy theory, if you can't make it, fake it.
[02:26:54.952 --> 02:26:56.393]  But since H.R.
[02:26:56.613 --> 02:27:03.439]  2977 never passed, they're using all these chemtrails and the heat weapons and the MK Ultra weapons on us.
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:06.222]  That's a violation of the Eighth Amendment, wouldn't you say?
[02:27:06.966 --> 02:27:08.067]  Well, yes, I would say.
[02:27:08.087 --> 02:27:10.849]  And they do admit they have all this stuff.
[02:27:10.909 --> 02:27:16.153]  I mean, even the show Atmospheres on the Weather Channel admits they can control the weather.
[02:27:16.613 --> 02:27:17.434]  Well, the 77 U.S.
[02:27:17.514 --> 02:27:23.899]  Senate MKUltra hearings revealed that these weapons would be used against our will and without our knowledge.
[02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:33.957]  Well, I've got the Boston Globe from three months ago, and there's a hyperlink to it in my DARPA Engineering Abuse System article on InfoWars in the News and Focus section.
[02:27:34.518 --> 02:27:47.868]  And DARPA announced the same folks that brought you gambling on dead troops and the Total Information Awareness Network, the all-seeing eye pyramid as a symbol radiating the earth, they announced they want to put up these mind control towers in our cities.
[02:27:47.888 --> 02:27:52.252]  Is that the same all-seeing eye on the old dollar bill with Albert Pike's eyeball?
[02:27:52.802 --> 02:27:53.482]  That's it, buddy.
[02:27:53.523 --> 02:27:54.223]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:54.943 --> 02:27:56.504]  Let's talk to Wesley in Tennessee.
[02:27:56.584 --> 02:27:57.525]  Wesley, you're on the air.
[02:27:57.605 --> 02:27:58.105]  Go ahead.
[02:27:58.625 --> 02:27:59.886]  God bless and good afternoon.
[02:28:01.627 --> 02:28:20.778]  Alec, I stumbled across a website a month or two back that was absolutely gruesome, and I really wish to heck that I had copied it down because I saw photographs of both American...
[02:28:21.738 --> 02:28:28.143]  And Iraqi troops that had literally been cooked inside their own uniforms.
[02:28:28.183 --> 02:28:29.644]  Their uniforms were unscathed.
[02:28:29.664 --> 02:28:31.305]  Yeah, I've seen those photos.
[02:28:32.046 --> 02:28:39.991]  And I saw bodies cut in half like somebody took a razor or a sharp knife or a sword and just slid them into two pieces.
[02:28:41.192 --> 02:28:50.719]  But the reason why I'm calling this afternoon is I want you to reach into your heart of hearts and give me your best assessments
[02:28:52.398 --> 02:29:18.511]  If we do get backed into a corner, and I say if, actually it's a given, when the day comes that they do declare martial law in this country and they do try to strip this nation of its sovereignty, do you believe in your heart that we will have men the caliber of the likes that defended the Alamo?
[02:29:18.531 --> 02:29:20.132]  There was a terrific...
[02:29:22.446 --> 02:29:27.189]  Relatively new documentary on the LMO just about a week ago.
[02:29:27.229 --> 02:29:31.332]  Wesley, I'll answer the question when we get back, and I get the point you're making, and I'll try to cover it.
[02:29:31.852 --> 02:29:33.373]  The news is straight ahead.
[02:29:33.694 --> 02:29:34.214]  Stay with us.
[02:29:36.135 --> 02:29:37.016]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.516 --> 02:29:39.137]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.058 --> 02:29:42.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:45.883 --> 02:29:51.788]  Oh my... I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:29:51.948 --> 02:29:52.588]  Yes, it's true.
[02:29:52.608 --> 02:29:55.330]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:29:55.451 --> 02:29:59.454]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[02:29:59.514 --> 02:30:00.114]  You heard it right.
[02:30:00.254 --> 02:30:05.258]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[02:30:05.338 --> 02:30:06.359]  The list goes on and on.
[02:30:06.599 --> 02:30:07.340]  You may miss out forever.
[02:30:23.516 --> 02:30:24.076]  We're good to go.
[02:30:46.044 --> 02:30:46.584]  We're good to go.
[02:30:46.604 --> 02:30:46.744]  I think?
[02:31:05.407 --> 02:31:13.052]  With a stock market on the skids, and really nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:31:13.452 --> 02:31:17.215]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.
[02:31:17.915 --> 02:31:21.958]  Call this toll-free number for your free investing and precious metals kit.
[02:31:22.358 --> 02:31:22.638]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:31:26.004 --> 02:31:30.709]  For the complete story, the highest quality precious metals, call Midas Resources.
[02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:37.316]  In business over 10 years, make the call and see why the ultra-rich invest in gold and other precious metals.
[02:31:37.897 --> 02:31:39.418]  We'll rush you the free information.
[02:31:39.959 --> 02:31:40.540]  Call today, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:31:45.543 --> 02:31:49.605]  We've all heard that garlic has been used for centuries to ward off everything from diseases to demons.
[02:31:49.925 --> 02:31:53.486]  What is it about garlic that makes it the most recognized and widely used spice in history?
[02:31:53.766 --> 02:31:54.726]  It's called allicin.
[02:31:55.167 --> 02:31:58.028]  Allicin is the primary active ingredient in fresh crushed garlic.
[02:31:58.388 --> 02:32:03.910]  According to the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry, garlic has only 5,000 micrograms of allicin potential.
[02:32:04.330 --> 02:32:07.491]  Garlamax has only 5,500 micrograms of allicin potential.
[02:32:07.731 --> 02:32:09.692]  But Allimax has 180,000 micrograms of allicin yield guaranteed.
[02:32:13.033 --> 02:32:18.177]  That's why Alamax stands head, shoulders, hips, and ankles above every other garlic product on the market today.
[02:32:18.477 --> 02:32:22.079]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Alamax.
[02:32:22.339 --> 02:32:23.920]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:32:25.742 --> 02:32:31.125]  Garlic is the number one all-natural, antiviral, and antibacterial spice on Earth, and Allison is the reason.
[02:32:31.405 --> 02:32:34.327]  When you need the power of garlic, you need the power of Alamax.
[02:32:34.568 --> 02:32:34.708]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:32:34.728 --> 02:32:34.948]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:32:35.048 --> 02:32:35.368]  And remember...
[02:32:41.412 --> 02:32:44.216]  Garlic is Allison, and Allison is Alamax.
[02:32:48.682 --> 02:32:54.710]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:32:55.311 --> 02:32:58.295]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:01.847 --> 02:33:06.610]  We stand against corruption, against the destruction of our republic, our sovereignty.
[02:33:06.650 --> 02:33:08.931]  It's all happening under the Democrats and Republicans.
[02:33:09.251 --> 02:33:10.832]  They're puppets of the New World Order.
[02:33:11.172 --> 02:33:18.997]  They've announced their New World Order, but the neocon shills say there's no such thing as a New World Order as our Supreme Court announces they're under its control.
[02:33:19.957 --> 02:33:25.280]  As our borders evaporate, as our sovereignty disappears, we stand against it.
[02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:29.803]  We stand for the Second Amendment, for the country, for the family.
[02:33:30.743 --> 02:33:34.225]  Now, I'm not going to take any more calls today because I've got a bunch of news.
[02:33:34.305 --> 02:33:37.246]  Chinese megabucks for Bush brothers.
[02:33:37.846 --> 02:33:39.667]  Terror alerts manufactured.
[02:33:39.687 --> 02:33:41.147]  This is the FBI admitting it.
[02:33:42.008 --> 02:33:46.690]  Some good news as well that I want to go over with the enemy combatant designation.
[02:33:46.990 --> 02:33:49.611]  A second highest court in the land saying it's unconstitutional.
[02:33:50.891 --> 02:33:56.714]  That's all coming up in the next 26 minutes that we have left here on the show.
[02:33:57.941 --> 02:33:59.782]  So again, please stay with us.
[02:34:00.262 --> 02:34:11.387]  I do want to encourage all the listeners, whether you're listening on the AM or FM dial, Internet, shortwave, whatever, to visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and to get my videos.
[02:34:11.527 --> 02:34:13.428]  I mean, take 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[02:34:14.569 --> 02:34:18.450]  It's two and a half hours long, two hours, 24 minutes on VHS, 170 minutes, almost three hours on DVD.
[02:34:23.516 --> 02:34:25.317]  And take about three minutes out of the film.
[02:34:25.677 --> 02:34:31.638]  FEMA in Kansas City to a group of police in a classroom saying all the Founding Fathers are terrorists, all Christians are terrorists.
[02:34:32.239 --> 02:34:35.920]  Not just the video of them saying that, the training manuals where it says defenders of the U.S.
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:38.860]  Constitution are terrorists, gun owners are terrorists.
[02:34:39.561 --> 02:34:40.761]  That's what they're setting up for.
[02:34:40.781 --> 02:34:44.022]  Troops training to take your guns, video of it.
[02:34:44.402 --> 02:34:47.923]  The Globalist carrying out September 11th to scare you into submission.
[02:34:48.748 --> 02:34:53.748]  That's just some of what's in this film, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, professionally produced.
[02:34:54.426 --> 02:34:55.267]  Now, you need to get that.
[02:34:55.307 --> 02:34:59.549]  You need to get Police State 3, Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, my newest film.
[02:34:59.989 --> 02:35:13.197]  Police State 3 and Matrix of Evil are my two newest films, covering PNAC, the government-run white slavery rings, what really happened in Iraq, Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, the state terrorism, laws they're passing.
[02:35:13.598 --> 02:35:15.059]  You need to have these videos.
[02:35:15.079 --> 02:35:18.200]  They're $25.95 apiece, all over two hours.
[02:35:18.601 --> 02:35:19.461]  Get three or more.
[02:35:19.601 --> 02:35:20.582]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[02:35:23.539 --> 02:35:28.581]  Get the new book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order, by Paul Watson, that I published.
[02:35:28.621 --> 02:35:33.442]  It's amazing, over 300 pages, over 50 documents and diagrams and photos.
[02:35:34.202 --> 02:35:41.805]  You need to get the video that we carry by Eric Hufschmidt, Painful Deceptions, covering 9-11 from another angle than I covered.
[02:35:42.525 --> 02:35:47.810]  You need to get these items at the USS Liberty, the Loss of Liberty video about government-sponsored terror.
[02:35:48.350 --> 02:35:54.094]  The best stuff out there is at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:54.114 --> 02:35:54.475]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:36:08.152 --> 02:36:16.294]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:36:17.575 --> 02:36:19.075]  Take action.
[02:36:19.415 --> 02:36:21.996]  90% of those that see the films are waking up.
[02:36:22.336 --> 02:36:24.357]  The New World Order is so out in the open now.
[02:36:24.637 --> 02:36:25.757]  It's hidden in plain sight.
[02:36:25.997 --> 02:36:29.238]  We just got to point it out to folks, and they're waking up.
[02:36:29.398 --> 02:36:32.579]  But we got to do it quick before the globalists carry out more terror.
[02:36:33.860 --> 02:36:37.282]  Now, coming up, we're going to talk about him throwing out the enemy combatant designation.
[02:36:37.322 --> 02:36:38.762]  That doesn't mean Bush is going to quit.
[02:36:38.822 --> 02:36:41.944]  Bush being paid off by the Communist Chinese and through his family.
[02:36:43.364 --> 02:36:46.666]  I want to get into the fake terror alerts, you name it, here in just a few minutes.
[02:36:46.686 --> 02:36:47.266]  We'll go to that.
[02:36:47.707 --> 02:37:01.193]  Right now, I want to bring Jim Shepard up, the owner and head guy at New Millennium Concepts, who makes the best water filters I know of at the best prices right here in the United States, or they have the British, Big Berkey as well.
[02:37:02.397 --> 02:37:10.040]  And we talk about the Ritalin, the Prozac, the hormones, the pesticides, the herbicides, the dead bacteria, the living bacteria.
[02:37:10.401 --> 02:37:11.701]  I was in Houston last weekend.
[02:37:11.761 --> 02:37:12.702]  I drank some tap water.
[02:37:12.802 --> 02:37:15.103]  It tasted like kerosene, folks.
[02:37:16.303 --> 02:37:18.324]  The fluoride, the chloride, all of it.
[02:37:18.684 --> 02:37:20.725]  It's time to protect yourself.
[02:37:20.825 --> 02:37:25.147]  And New Millennium Concept ships out UPS the day they get the order.
[02:37:25.905 --> 02:37:26.926]  You need to give them a call.
[02:37:26.986 --> 02:37:28.947]  You'll get it by Christmas, before Christmas.
[02:37:29.808 --> 02:37:34.151]  This is one of the last days you can order, and be assured that you get it before Christmas.
[02:37:34.591 --> 02:37:38.174]  A great gift for those that already have Big Berkeys or the Berkey Light.
[02:37:38.954 --> 02:37:40.455]  It's now time to take action.
[02:37:40.495 --> 02:37:41.716]  Jim, thanks for coming on the show.
[02:37:41.997 --> 02:37:43.097]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:37:43.818 --> 02:37:53.705]  Well, Alex, I just want to tell your listeners today that right now we have more specials that we're offering than we ever have on your show before.
[02:37:54.358 --> 02:37:57.739]  In fact, in January, typically we'll offer one or two specials.
[02:37:58.239 --> 02:38:05.642]  Because of the Christmas season, we wanted to give everybody a complete selection to find the right package for their needs.
[02:38:06.202 --> 02:38:21.148]  Now, today is the last day that you can order and have it there before Christmas if you live in Maine, Vermont, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, and the eastern half of Pennsylvania, and the southern tip of Florida.
[02:38:22.646 --> 02:38:27.768]  Each day that we go from here, it will be less likely that you'll get that by Christmas.
[02:38:27.948 --> 02:38:38.532]  Tomorrow, we're going to knock out Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, the northern part of Florida, and so forth.
[02:38:38.552 --> 02:38:45.554]  So basically, we're going to be moving from the east to the west, where we can send it regular-day shipping, and it won't cost you extra.
[02:38:46.556 --> 02:38:49.679]  Now, I also thought I'd review some of the specials that are up there.
[02:38:49.739 --> 02:38:52.761]  You can find these specials on Infowars.com.
[02:38:52.781 --> 02:38:54.483]  Go up there and click on the Berkey light.
[02:38:55.944 --> 02:39:00.047]  We put together an inexpensive Berkey light.
[02:39:00.548 --> 02:39:06.453]  That's the one with the clear chamber with the imperial ceramic filter element.
[02:39:06.973 --> 02:39:07.293]  Normally $199, $149.00.
[02:39:11.144 --> 02:39:14.485]  And then we also have quantity pricing on the sport bottles.
[02:39:14.505 --> 02:39:18.286]  We have a $99 package and a $199 package.
[02:39:18.707 --> 02:39:31.271]  And this is designed so you can take care of a half dozen or a dozen of your relatives and friends and all give them a nice gift that's going to keep their health intact and will keep them in good stead during an emergency.
[02:39:31.771 --> 02:39:34.352]  Something that really is a value rather than a trinket.
[02:39:34.972 --> 02:39:37.313]  And so for the $99 and the $199 you can take care of 6 or 12 of your
[02:39:41.238 --> 02:39:41.898]  of your friends.
[02:39:42.619 --> 02:39:53.802]  We also have the Berkey Lights specials for the holiday, and that's where you can get those at a discount by buying quantity, either two or four of them, so you can give them out to various different people.
[02:39:54.823 --> 02:39:59.824]  Now, I also wanted to focus attention on one special that you will not find on the website.
[02:40:00.384 --> 02:40:02.005]  This is the October special.
[02:40:03.105 --> 02:40:04.326]  People love this special.
[02:40:04.366 --> 02:40:09.468]  We started getting calls from people saying, gee, can you run that up again just for a short period of time for Christmas?
[02:40:09.528 --> 02:40:10.668]  And so we said yes.
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:14.983]  And so that special is one Berkey light with the lights.
[02:40:15.143 --> 02:40:16.564]  You can get white or blue.
[02:40:16.784 --> 02:40:18.906]  White is great for camping, great for emergencies.
[02:40:19.347 --> 02:40:21.068]  Blue is beautiful for ambience.
[02:40:21.248 --> 02:40:22.769]  It's the prettiest of the systems.
[02:40:23.670 --> 02:40:28.594]  You also get the Berkey MP solar charger.
[02:40:28.754 --> 02:40:38.162]  That will charge your cell phones, your radios, the Berkey light, and so it will keep you with the light communications, power, and you also have water.
[02:40:39.168 --> 02:40:45.552]  You also get a KDF shower filter to get those nasty chemicals out of your shower water so you don't breathe them in and get them in your body.
[02:40:46.353 --> 02:40:47.833]  Also, a battery adapter.
[02:40:48.474 --> 02:40:52.997]  The battery adapter will run the Berkey Light lights, which you can see for over a mile in the dark.
[02:40:53.457 --> 02:41:00.241]  It will run them for over two weeks every night on one set of AA alkaline batteries.
[02:41:01.081 --> 02:41:08.526]  And then we're also going to include two sport bottles or two potassium iodate, or you can mix and match, get one of each.
[02:41:09.099 --> 02:41:13.281]  Now, sports bottles are, again, little water filters that look like a sports bottle.
[02:41:13.661 --> 02:41:15.002]  You've got some great deals on those.
[02:41:15.282 --> 02:41:16.502]  Throw out the phone number, Jim.
[02:41:16.762 --> 02:41:18.743]  Okay, the special on that, normally $471.
[02:41:18.883 --> 02:41:19.624]  The special price is $383.
[02:41:19.684 --> 02:41:20.344]  That's a savings of $88.
[02:41:20.544 --> 02:41:21.945]  Give us a holler at 888-803-
[02:41:29.950 --> 02:41:36.477]  And by the way, Debbie's going to be there tonight, too, answering the phones, folks.
[02:41:36.537 --> 02:41:37.959]  So, 888-803-4438.
[02:41:38.179 --> 02:41:43.926]  Get your order in so you can get it on or before Christmas.
[02:41:43.946 --> 02:41:44.566]  888-803-4438.
[02:41:44.686 --> 02:41:45.768]  A ship out.
[02:41:48.350 --> 02:41:50.713]  UPS, order at the website.
[02:41:50.753 --> 02:41:55.437]  They take the orders down each day and send them out.
[02:41:55.457 --> 02:41:55.577]  888-803-4438.
[02:41:55.597 --> 02:41:57.960]  If you call, the phones are busy, leave your name and number.
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:41:59.181]  Debbie will call you back today.
[02:41:59.201 --> 02:41:59.862]  888-803-4438.
[02:41:59.942 --> 02:42:02.704]  And that $149 deal for your Big Berkey system
[02:42:06.946 --> 02:42:07.647]  Always a pleasure.
[02:42:07.747 --> 02:42:09.028]  You have a great holiday, too.
[02:42:27.344 --> 02:42:31.806]  Yeah, we don't have any magic products that'll save you or grow your hair back or anything like that.
[02:42:31.866 --> 02:42:36.448]  Just, you know, videos, books, and water filters at great prices.
[02:42:37.209 --> 02:42:39.410]  It's real stuff, folks, and so I hope you take action.
[02:42:39.490 --> 02:42:44.092]  Okay, let me get into this news, because there's so much of it, and I've got about 18 minutes left, or 17.
[02:42:45.673 --> 02:42:48.334]  Chinese megabucks for Bush Brothers.
[02:42:48.374 --> 02:42:53.056]  Now, this has been in the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Times, but hardly anybody even knows about this.
[02:42:53.076 --> 02:42:54.757]  And this is just some of the business dealings.
[02:42:55.973 --> 02:43:00.957]  It was Bush Sr., who was the ambassador for Nixon after he was CIA director, who opened China up.
[02:43:03.579 --> 02:43:04.820]  Now listen to this carefully.
[02:43:06.241 --> 02:43:08.383]  Chinese megabucks for Bush brothers.
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:11.841]  And the Bush brothers do nothing and get millions of dollars.
[02:43:11.881 --> 02:43:12.321]  Listen to this.
[02:43:12.882 --> 02:43:20.946]  Many observers were surprised last week when George W. Bush came down in favor of the People's Republic of China against a Democratic referendum in Taiwan.
[02:43:21.326 --> 02:43:30.551]  His weighing in on behalf of mainland China becomes more questionable at a time when well-connected Chinese companies are funneling large sums of money to Bush's brothers.
[02:43:31.371 --> 02:43:33.252]  News reports, and by the way, Bush Sr.
[02:43:33.272 --> 02:43:35.133]  gets paid millions for speeches there, folks.
[02:43:36.448 --> 02:43:36.909]  Millions.
[02:43:37.551 --> 02:43:38.393]  But that's okay.
[02:43:38.433 --> 02:43:40.799]  When Clinton decides to do a suit deal, it's evil, though.
[02:43:40.839 --> 02:43:41.581]  Which it is evil.
[02:43:41.922 --> 02:43:43.566]  But, see, the neocons only tell you about that.
[02:43:44.179 --> 02:43:44.919]  We're good to go.
[02:44:14.068 --> 02:44:19.532]  The business's press has conjectured that Grace hoped to influence U.S.
[02:44:19.673 --> 02:44:22.034]  limits on exporting sensitive technology to China.
[02:44:22.535 --> 02:44:29.680]  An even bigger Chinese company recently moved in ways that benefit youngest Bush, brother Marvin P. Bush.
[02:44:30.061 --> 02:44:33.944]  The company is Hong Kong-based Xiong Kong Holdings.
[02:44:34.604 --> 02:44:42.630]  And it goes on to talk about a huge magnet of real estate and investment conglomerate now branching into biotechs.
[02:44:43.050 --> 02:44:51.336]  According to the company, combined market capitalization of the Cheung Kung Group amounts to $515 billion.
[02:44:51.356 --> 02:44:52.157]  Did you hear that?
[02:44:52.177 --> 02:44:52.777]  $515 billion.
[02:44:57.422 --> 02:44:58.102]  That's amazing.
[02:44:58.662 --> 02:45:04.664]  Or approximately 11.5% of the total market capitalization of the Hong Kong stock market.
[02:45:05.304 --> 02:45:15.927]  Chung Yong Kong Portfolio now includes Critical Path, Inc., a California-based software and internet messaging services company that lost money for the first time in nine months of the year.
[02:45:16.247 --> 02:45:19.628]  The company's SEC filings list a significant shareholder as Mr.
[02:45:20.649 --> 02:45:21.910]  We're good to go.
[02:45:21.970 --> 02:45:23.211]  We're good to go.
[02:45:23.331 --> 02:45:23.991]  We're good to go.
[02:45:24.051 --> 02:45:24.432]  We're good to go.
[02:45:41.984 --> 02:45:46.766]  Chuk Chung-kung already owns a substantial shares in Critical Path in December 2001.
[02:45:47.547 --> 02:45:58.251]  Its backing can only solidify the net worth of Critical Path, which has faced class action litigation and has changed top managers a couple of times in the past three years.
[02:45:58.792 --> 02:46:08.176]  It thus cannot help but boost Winston Partners, a private investment firm in northern Virginia formed by Bush with longtime business associate A. Scott Andrews.
[02:46:08.756 --> 02:46:09.137]  We're good to go.
[02:46:24.637 --> 02:46:25.057]  We're good to go.
[02:46:49.207 --> 02:46:51.208]  Are not exhibited.
[02:46:51.228 --> 02:46:56.969]  The White House and the Bush brothers have not responded to questions and requests for information.
[02:46:57.630 --> 02:47:02.031]  Yeah, Marvin tried to deny this about a month ago, and then it came out in the divorce stuff.
[02:47:02.391 --> 02:47:05.932]  Questions to the companies, to the CIA and the FBI have not been answered.
[02:47:06.332 --> 02:47:06.813]  We're good to go.
[02:47:23.035 --> 02:47:23.676]  That's James Baker.
[02:47:23.696 --> 02:47:25.757]  This is Restoring Honor and Dignity to the White House.
[02:47:46.380 --> 02:47:47.921]  Yeah, right, like Bush said he'd do.
[02:47:48.001 --> 02:47:55.305]  Ching-Yung Kong Holdings and Grace Semiconductor are part of the intensely networked Chinese economy with a high degree of public-private partnership.
[02:47:55.345 --> 02:47:56.085]  That means the government.
[02:47:56.425 --> 02:48:05.130]  For Bush to allow his relatives, especially close relatives, to benefit financially from deals with well-connected firms is what used to be called Red China.
[02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:12.934]  Is it best a sorry reflection on his taste for him to follow these deals with a massive ship of support to China, especially one...
[02:48:13.214 --> 02:48:16.957]  That discourages a democratic referendum in Taiwan is a worse reflection.
[02:48:19.018 --> 02:48:26.064]  Now, folks, when the Wall Street Journal asked him about this, well, what's your knowledge of semiconductors?
[02:48:26.084 --> 02:48:27.065]  Why are you getting paid $2 million?
[02:48:27.085 --> 02:48:28.305]  He goes, oh, they just like me.
[02:48:30.387 --> 02:48:37.993]  I mean, his daddy goes to China or Japan, gets a million bucks a pop, $700,000, $1.2 million, depending on where he's speaking.
[02:48:38.093 --> 02:48:39.034]  It's a joke.
[02:48:40.014 --> 02:48:40.895]  It's a joke.
[02:48:42.163 --> 02:48:45.966]  And Halliburton, no one gets bids, only Halliburton gets the deals.
[02:48:46.266 --> 02:48:50.389]  This thing about, ooh, let's not give foreigners contracts, that's a red herring.
[02:48:50.770 --> 02:48:55.113]  Only Bechtel, Halliburton, and DynCorp get contracts in Iraq, folks.
[02:48:56.734 --> 02:48:58.876]  Don't worry about the foreigners getting contracts.
[02:48:59.116 --> 02:49:01.137]  Nobody else in America is going to get the contracts.
[02:49:01.358 --> 02:49:08.303]  It's a red herring to shift you off that debate of, yeah, contracts, don't give them to them French, them Germans.
[02:49:10.394 --> 02:49:12.576]  Oh, it's so unbelievable, folks.
[02:49:12.636 --> 02:49:13.897]  Just absolutely incredible.
[02:49:13.917 --> 02:49:14.357]  Listen to this.
[02:49:14.377 --> 02:49:15.458]  This is from World Net Daily.
[02:49:15.478 --> 02:49:17.740]  It was in the Associated Press in January.
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:20.021]  I wanted to go back to this because it shows the line.
[02:49:21.222 --> 02:49:22.883]  Terror alerts manufactured.
[02:49:23.063 --> 02:49:24.364]  If you were right in this, we'd be arrested.
[02:49:24.745 --> 02:49:27.847]  FBI agents say White House scripting hysterics for political effect.
[02:49:28.835 --> 02:49:29.917]  Again, yelling fire in a theater.
[02:49:30.237 --> 02:49:36.865]  Intelligence pros say the White House is manufacturing terrorist alerts to keep the issue alive in the minds of voters and to keep President Bush's approval ratings high.
[02:49:37.146 --> 02:49:38.227]  Capitol Hill Blue reports.
[02:49:38.688 --> 02:49:46.117]  The Thursday report said that the administration is engaging in an hysterics and issuing numerous terror alerts that have little to no basis in fact.
[02:49:47.057 --> 02:49:50.439]  And even the White House press secretary, before he left, had to admit that.
[02:49:50.779 --> 02:49:52.960]  Unfortunately, we haven't made a lot of progress.
[02:49:53.700 --> 02:50:00.924]  It goes on, one FBI agent familiar with terrorism operations told Capitol Hill Blue, we've been spinning our heels the last few weeks.
[02:50:01.704 --> 02:50:14.371]  Other sources in the Bureau and the Central Intelligence Agency said the administration is pressuring intelligence agencies to develop something, anything, to support an array of non-Pacific terrorism alerts issued by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:50:15.797 --> 02:50:18.558]  And it goes on to talk about how they've been ordered to do this.
[02:50:18.778 --> 02:50:21.900]  I mean, just absolutely amazing.
[02:50:23.281 --> 02:50:25.982]  Oh, hey, the Pope likes Mel Gibson's new film, The Passion.
[02:50:26.482 --> 02:50:28.883]  He saw it and said it is as it was.
[02:50:29.984 --> 02:50:31.124]  That's from the Wall Street Journal.
[02:50:31.144 --> 02:50:41.369]  We'll come back, talk about enemy combatant designation, 9-11 share attack was preventable, and a few other key tidbits of news in the final segment.
[02:50:41.729 --> 02:50:42.430]  Stay the course.
[02:50:42.470 --> 02:50:43.210]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:46.109 --> 02:50:50.431]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.631 --> 02:50:55.034]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:55.194 --> 02:50:59.556]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:50:59.616 --> 02:51:00.937]  The New World Order.
[02:51:02.757 --> 02:51:06.959]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:07.019 --> 02:51:13.962]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:14.082 --> 02:51:16.143]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.483 --> 02:51:19.545]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[02:51:19.705 --> 02:51:26.827]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:27.087 --> 02:51:32.449]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:51:32.969 --> 02:51:35.610]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:51:35.710 --> 02:51:36.891]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:51:36.911 --> 02:51:37.151]  That's 888.
[02:51:41.793 --> 02:51:48.917]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:51:49.177 --> 02:51:52.680]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:51:52.760 --> 02:51:56.722]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:51:56.923 --> 02:52:03.107]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:52:03.507 --> 02:52:09.451]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE
[02:52:11.832 --> 02:52:17.174]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:52:17.314 --> 02:52:21.096]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:52:21.456 --> 02:52:23.336]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:52:23.376 --> 02:52:25.557]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:52:25.777 --> 02:52:30.119]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[02:52:42.403 --> 02:52:43.223]  Protect your family.
[02:52:44.283 --> 02:52:47.224]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[02:52:47.584 --> 02:52:49.184]  Oh, yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[02:52:49.364 --> 02:52:55.005]  Cheaperhotels.com, saveonyourrentalcar.com, halfpriceairlinetickets.com.
[02:52:55.065 --> 02:53:00.846]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.

[02:53:21.121 --> 02:53:21.821]  Not convinced yet?
[02:53:21.941 --> 02:53:25.703]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?

[02:53:48.388 --> 02:53:49.670]  All right, folks.
[02:53:49.710 --> 02:53:57.042]  Here we are now in the final segment of this Thursday edition of the show.
[02:53:57.462 --> 02:53:59.666]  Bush overruled an enemy combatant case.
[02:54:00.604 --> 02:54:06.450]  And again, this was in Patriot Act II, which hadn't been passed until last Saturday quietly by the White House.
[02:54:07.131 --> 02:54:09.733]  But they were already implementing it a year and a half ago.
[02:54:10.194 --> 02:54:23.327]  And finally, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land, has thrown it out and says you can't just grab American citizens without charging them and hold them for years and years indefinitely.
[02:54:24.167 --> 02:54:24.608]  We're good to go.
[02:54:24.628 --> 02:54:24.808]  I think?
[02:54:40.649 --> 02:54:44.910]  Six years after her murder, and I've done all shows on this, but she was murdered.
[02:54:44.970 --> 02:54:46.610]  That's now the headlines in the British media.
[02:54:46.630 --> 02:54:48.571]  The British government killed Diana.
[02:54:48.891 --> 02:54:50.231]  She was pregnant by an Arab, folks.
[02:54:50.251 --> 02:54:51.651]  They weren't going to allow that to happen.
[02:54:52.011 --> 02:54:59.153]  The British Royal Family's coroner says an inquest into the deaths of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed will take place next month.
[02:54:59.633 --> 02:55:08.415]  The legal probe announced Thursday will investigate the circumstances of the 97 deaths of Princess Diana and Mr. Fayed, who were killed in a car crash in Paris.
[02:55:08.475 --> 02:55:08.875]  The inquest
[02:55:09.695 --> 02:55:11.737]  In Britain's first official probe into the deaths.
[02:55:12.197 --> 02:55:20.082]  All I can add with time constraints is, you know, she said two months before she was killed in a letter that I'm going to be killed in a fake car wreck.
[02:55:20.182 --> 02:55:21.043]  I've been warned.
[02:55:21.063 --> 02:55:22.484]  We're warning her.
[02:55:24.105 --> 02:55:26.847]  You abort that baby or you're dead.
[02:55:28.084 --> 02:55:31.687]  Oh, royals never kill members of their family throughout history.
[02:55:32.027 --> 02:55:33.128]  No!
[02:55:33.528 --> 02:55:34.609]  Conspiracy theory.
[02:55:34.629 --> 02:55:36.110]  Well, I don't have time to go over all the evidence.
[02:55:36.170 --> 02:55:36.731]  It's massive.
[02:55:37.231 --> 02:55:41.935]  I've got an article here out of KCRA out of California, Sacramento.
[02:55:42.916 --> 02:55:47.279]  They're not just putting face scanning and cameras in the school and the bathrooms and the rest of it.
[02:55:47.959 --> 02:55:53.264]  It says it's hooked into the police department and wired in with other schools.
[02:55:54.665 --> 02:55:54.925]  So...
[02:55:56.122 --> 02:55:58.764]  This is the new system.
[02:56:00.785 --> 02:56:09.330]  So see, they're wiring them into control grids, just like the Tennessee schools, with the cameras in the showers, and it was wired into the federal government and to other states.
[02:56:10.563 --> 02:56:12.224]  With people downloading the video?
[02:56:13.345 --> 02:56:19.389]  I mean, you just couldn't make something up this out of control, this sickening, this disgusting.
[02:56:19.409 --> 02:56:27.055]  9-11 chair, who's in business with the Bushes, trying to act like they're doing a real investigation, says attack was preventable for the first time.
[02:56:27.095 --> 02:56:38.423]  The chairman of the Independent Commission investigating the September 11 attacks is saying publicly that 9-11 could have and should have been prevented, reports CBS News correspondent Randall Hinkston.
[02:56:39.338 --> 02:56:43.499]  This is a very, very important part of history, and we've got to tell it right, said Thomas Keene.
[02:56:44.429 --> 02:56:49.732]  As you read the report, you're going to have a pretty clear idea of what's been done and what should have been done.
[02:56:50.053 --> 02:56:52.634]  His answer, of course, he's already said, is more funding, more power.
[02:56:52.994 --> 02:56:53.895]  Oh, we messed up.
[02:56:53.935 --> 02:56:54.996]  Just give us more funds.
[02:56:55.276 --> 02:56:56.076]  That will punish us.
[02:56:56.557 --> 02:57:02.300]  This was not something that had to happen, he went on to say, appointed by the Bush administration, independent counsel appointed by him.
[02:57:02.820 --> 02:57:03.261]  I love that.
[02:57:03.281 --> 02:57:09.945]  It's like when Reno appointed that senator from Missouri to investigate her and Clinton.
[02:57:10.225 --> 02:57:13.267]  It's like hiring Heinrich Himmler to investigate Hitler.
[02:57:13.787 --> 02:57:20.373]  Appointed by a Bush administration, Keene, a former Republican governor of New Jersey, is now pointing fingers inside the administration and laying blame.
[02:57:20.473 --> 02:57:25.497]  There are people that, if I was doing the job, would certainly not be in the position they are in at the time.
[02:57:25.737 --> 02:57:27.418]  Because they failed, they simply failed.
[02:57:28.299 --> 02:57:31.141]  They blamed some low-level people and called for more funds.
[02:57:31.902 --> 02:57:34.604]  Saddam's arrest has fueled insurgency.
[02:57:35.465 --> 02:57:41.950]  Police are increasingly the target of, as 40 Iraqis die in four days of violence, that's ten a day.
[02:57:43.228 --> 02:57:45.129]  And our troops are breathing depleted uranium.
[02:57:45.169 --> 02:57:46.711]  That's the real threat.
[02:57:47.151 --> 02:57:51.034]  Bush says Saddam should get the death penalty for his crimes.
[02:57:51.054 --> 02:57:53.836]  Yeah, he's a bad guy, but he's your business partner.
[02:57:53.896 --> 02:57:55.337]  He's your daddy's business partner.
[02:57:56.037 --> 02:57:56.718]  That's admitted.
[02:57:56.758 --> 02:57:58.259]  You told him to attack Iran.
[02:57:58.299 --> 02:57:59.560]  You told him to go into Kuwait.
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:04.283]  We have April Glaspie, your ambassador, your daddy's ambassador on video, saying so.
[02:58:04.823 --> 02:58:06.244]  So why don't we talk about that?
[02:58:07.545 --> 02:58:08.466]  Makes me sick!
[02:58:09.164 --> 02:58:16.107]  Whether it's Bin Laden or whether it's Saddam, they're always their former business partners, always CIA assets.
[02:58:16.808 --> 02:58:20.529]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight Central on your local AM or FM dial.
[02:58:21.410 --> 02:58:24.751]  Or on the Global Shortwave, 9 to midnight at 5.085, 6890.

[02:58:31.034 --> 02:58:31.774]  God bless you all.
[02:58:31.794 --> 02:58:33.275]  I'll see you back tonight, back tomorrow.
