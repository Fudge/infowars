[00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:06.118]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:18.848]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:20.289]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.511]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:26.393]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:30.877]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:46.773]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:50.915]  Welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:51.627 --> 00:00:52.168]  We're good to go.
[00:01:07.627 --> 00:01:12.732]  And from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time at 5.085 and 6890.
[00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:17.177]  And, of course, the website's being freshly updated as we speak.
[00:01:17.657 --> 00:01:23.343]  Infowars.net, Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:26.446]  Big show lined up for you today.
[00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:29.589]  I want to talk about the stock market and the plunging dollar.
[00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:37.147]  It's now coming out the Federal Reserve has actually been pushing a weakening in the dollar, abandoning the strong dollar stance.
[00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:41.888]  In fact, they said this three and a half years ago at Davos, Switzerland.
[00:01:42.028 --> 00:01:44.209]  I took their word on it seriously.
[00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:47.970]  Now they're saying it again, and the dollar is plunging even more.
[00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:58.873]  Very bad news for everyone in the United States, other than the globalists and the private banks that hold the shares in the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve system.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.543]  Also, states all across the country, including Texas, are passing bills.
[00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:06.763]  It's passed the House.
[00:02:07.244 --> 00:02:29.876]  It's now in the Senate here in Texas in the legislature, state legislature, to accept Mexican ID cards, which they've proven can be easily bought, or you can get fake ones, which leaves our country wide open to terrorists, but the government doesn't care because they control when and how we're attacked by terrorists and destroy more of our liberties when that takes place.
[00:02:31.578 --> 00:02:32.198]  I think we're good to go.
[00:02:57.925 --> 00:03:01.546]  But you're going to have a national ID card through your driver's license.
[00:03:01.886 --> 00:03:08.169]  You're going to be tracked and traced and treated like a criminal because you're, I guess, the good producing slaves out there.
[00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.110]  Also, all is not well in Baghdad.
[00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.792]  In Iraq, they are now removing the general who was the head of an Israeli defense company.
[00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:19.506]  We'll be discussing that.
[00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:22.770]  We've got John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, saying the Patriot Act II doesn't exist.
[00:03:36.443 --> 00:03:45.489]  And the news having a big debate over it when the thing was introduced six months ago in the Senate under S-22.
[00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:54.474]  They've passed large provisions of it, subsections of it, and other bills, and there's still a debate on whether or not it exists.
[00:03:55.154 --> 00:03:56.595]  This only means one thing.
[00:03:56.795 --> 00:04:02.579]  Not just the mainstream media, but the alternative media is not doing its homework.
[00:04:03.795 --> 00:04:05.956]  He's doing zero research.
[00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:13.080]  I mean, it was our listeners that pointed out S-22 had a similar name as the House version.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.041]  One word was different.
[00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:22.085]  Justice Domestic Security Enhancement Act, the Senate version, the House version, Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:23.766]  And it's the same bill.
[00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:27.368]  In fact, it's got even added garbage in it, a bunch of gun controls.
[00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:29.139]  We're good to go.
[00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:30.140]  We're good to go.
[00:04:53.604 --> 00:04:59.931]  In the Chicago paper, they had a picture of Darth Vader on the cover, and it said, We're an empire.
[00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:01.393]  Get used to it.
[00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:03.715]  Unbelievable.
[00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:05.397]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:05.537 --> 00:05:07.379]  We've got Colonel Roberts joining us as well.
[00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.960]  Stay with me.
[00:05:10.174 --> 00:05:11.755]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:17.877]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:05:18.137 --> 00:05:23.279]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:32.883]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:05:33.243 --> 00:05:38.207]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:05:38.527 --> 00:05:42.550]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.494]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:05:47.874 --> 00:05:53.759]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:05:54.119 --> 00:06:03.149]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.431]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:06:10.854 --> 00:06:18.257]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:18.517 --> 00:06:23.239]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:29.121]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:33.883]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:06:34.104 --> 00:06:41.267]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:41.287 --> 00:06:45.810]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.491]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:55.435]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:06:55.675 --> 00:07:00.924]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.371]  We're good to go.
[00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:42.599]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water, normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.102]  It's also very hydrating and, more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[00:07:47.623 --> 00:07:51.305]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease,
[00:07:51.605 --> 00:07:55.809]  Listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley Sunday evenings at 6 p.m.
[00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:57.270]  Central, 7 Eastern.
[00:07:57.471 --> 00:08:06.218]  Call 1-888-826-4448 to learn more or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[00:08:06.398 --> 00:08:09.001]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[00:08:10.936 --> 00:08:13.118]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:13.698 --> 00:08:27.910]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:32.034]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:32.254 --> 00:08:33.435]  Those that love liberty.
[00:08:33.915 --> 00:08:36.237]  Those that love our constitutional republic.
[00:08:36.798 --> 00:08:39.060]  Thank you for joining me today.
[00:08:40.026 --> 00:08:49.533]  Tonight, this morning, depending on what time zone you're listening to us in, this is the Alex Jones Show, and yes, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:50.253 --> 00:09:04.664]  Yesterday, I was scanning the news wires and found an Austin American Statesman story, a Chicago Tribune article, a New York Times article, and yes, about ten others with similar headlines and similar content.
[00:09:06.138 --> 00:09:13.682]  I guess this whole trend got started last week by an ABC News story that said, Are we a global empire?
[00:09:14.242 --> 00:09:18.325]  Well, now here's the headline from the Chicago Tribune.
[00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:20.806]  American Empire, it's here.
[00:09:21.066 --> 00:09:22.767]  Better get used to it.
[00:09:23.567 --> 00:09:28.010]  And big here on the front page of the paper is Darth Vader.
[00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:41.145]  And frankly, if you go down to any type of political demonstration, even with 30 demonstrators here in Austin, you will see people dressed almost exactly like Darth Vader.
[00:09:42.111 --> 00:09:45.013]  So I guess they're sending us a little message here.
[00:09:45.053 --> 00:09:49.615]  You see, I guess George Lucas tried to create an image of tyranny.
[00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:51.696]  He did a pretty good job of it.
[00:09:52.256 --> 00:10:02.041]  And our police, our federal police, have funded our local police to have the black armored uniforms and the black Nazi helmets and the submachine guns.
[00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:04.683]  But American Empire, it's here.
[00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:09.205]  Better get used to it with a picture of Darth Vader.
[00:10:11.127 --> 00:10:11.828]  That's right.
[00:10:12.068 --> 00:10:15.050]  The American Empire, like it or not, it's reality.
[00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.971]  Embrace it.
[00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:16.971]  Get used to it.
[00:10:17.372 --> 00:10:17.512]  Oh!
[00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:20.214]  And every headline says this.
[00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:21.074]  Embrace it.
[00:10:21.134 --> 00:10:21.915]  Get used to it.
[00:10:22.035 --> 00:10:22.736]  Accept it.
[00:10:23.136 --> 00:10:24.977]  It's a new world order.
[00:10:24.997 --> 00:10:28.420]  And we're posting several of these.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:35.845]  Maybe we should create an American Empire section on prisonplanet.com or infowars.com.
[00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:39.228]  And they say, rise and fall of empires.
[00:10:40.283 --> 00:11:00.710]  And they've got the Roman, the Byzantine, the Ottoman, the British, the Soviet, and it says we're the new empire, and it says we're going to be running everything, and we're not going to have any rights, but hey, this is to keep us all safe, and they've told the middle class you'll be able to hold on to your 401ks if you go along with the empire.
[00:11:02.032 --> 00:11:05.474]  So many yuppies I talk to go, yes, it's an empire.
[00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.194]  Yes, it's about oil.
[00:11:07.574 --> 00:11:09.155]  Yes, it's about a new world order.
[00:11:09.615 --> 00:11:12.697]  Alex, we've got to do it to protect our way of life.
[00:11:13.357 --> 00:11:16.738]  Let me give you a news flash out there.
[00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:25.642]  The very people setting up this empire are the ones putting out policy reports calling for a drop in the dollar.
[00:11:26.383 --> 00:11:29.704]  They're the very ones calling on taking your pension funds.
[00:11:30.234 --> 00:11:30.834]  We're good to go.
[00:11:30.854 --> 00:11:31.114]  I think?
[00:11:53.419 --> 00:12:04.364]  But somehow through the pundits on the nightly news and the Sunday news programs, they have convinced you that this is about defending America and defending your bank accounts.
[00:12:04.444 --> 00:12:14.889]  Well, you're going to find out real quick if you haven't already found out that the people that are bringing you this empire brought you NAFTA and GATT, which is the merging of our countries.
[00:12:15.249 --> 00:12:24.675]  And they're going to take everything you've got and replace it with militarized police and regular military on your streets.
[00:12:27.057 --> 00:12:38.884]  You know, when you read an IMF or World Bank or Federal Reserve document that's public and it says they're going to take everything you've got, they say they're going to put into cashless society, they say they're going to break up the family, they say they're going to give you a national ID card.
[00:12:39.651 --> 00:12:42.892]  They say they're going to track and trace you and tax you to drive your car.
[00:12:43.372 --> 00:12:46.833]  They say they're going to have a national sales tax on top of the income tax.
[00:12:47.093 --> 00:12:54.275]  They say they're going to have federal retraining and jobs where you go, quote, work for the government for some private corporation in pure fascism.
[00:12:54.836 --> 00:12:56.676]  And you guys haven't figured that out yet.
[00:12:56.736 --> 00:12:58.457]  Well, you're going to figure this out.
[00:13:01.177 --> 00:13:05.939]  An incredible article by Julia Keller and Marjai Mills...
[00:13:07.373 --> 00:13:10.196]  And it's a Chicago Tribune article.
[00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:13.158]  The American Empire, like it or not, it's reality.
[00:13:13.258 --> 00:13:13.879]  Embrace it.
[00:13:13.979 --> 00:13:14.819]  Get used to it.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.202]  Oh, so we're not supposed to be part of the process.
[00:13:18.222 --> 00:13:23.086]  We're not supposed to have opinions or say we don't want to be part of an empire.
[00:13:23.587 --> 00:13:24.547]  It's embrace it.
[00:13:24.607 --> 00:13:25.308]  Get used to it.
[00:13:25.348 --> 00:13:26.629]  And I have the other headlines here.
[00:13:26.989 --> 00:13:32.294]  New York Times, Austin American-Statesman, ABC News, Knight Ritter News Service.
[00:13:33.055 --> 00:13:35.756]  They're all saying Empire, get used to it.
[00:13:35.836 --> 00:13:45.140]  Just magically, all of a sudden, at least a dozen articles today and yesterday in the big papers saying Empire, get used to it.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:52.783]  I stood there this morning in front of five newspaper machines at the convenience store.
[00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:59.003]  Gassing my vehicle up, and there were the headlines on every paper.
[00:13:59.183 --> 00:14:00.584]  Empire, get used to it.
[00:14:01.084 --> 00:14:02.785]  Oh, we don't have controlled media.
[00:14:02.905 --> 00:14:04.246]  No.
[00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.149]  No, we don't have controlled media.
[00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:09.590]  Listen to this little article.
[00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:12.472]  Oh, yeah, this one's real interesting.
[00:14:13.633 --> 00:14:16.315]  This little baby is out of the Washington Post.
[00:14:17.196 --> 00:14:18.237]  Washington Bureau.
[00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:18.597]  Washington Bureau.
[00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:24.258]  Patriot Act II draws opposition from all sides.
[00:14:25.158 --> 00:14:30.801]  Leaked document reveals ideas for further broadening government powers.
[00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:36.064]  And it says here, Attorney General John Ashcroft says it doesn't really exist.
[00:14:36.565 --> 00:14:44.349]  Civil rights advocates, immigration attorneys, internet privacy groups, conservative think tanks, and lawmakers, nonetheless, are gearing up to fight it.
[00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:46.410]  Now, wait a minute.
[00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:58.878]  Now, in my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, I have Ashcroft in 2001, during the passage of Patriot Act 1, saying there's these cries of lost liberty, phantoms of lost liberty.
[00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:03.040]  When you say this, you only aid the terrorist, and you will lose your liberty.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.521]  Then we fast forward to 2003, before the Senate and the House.
[00:15:07.202 --> 00:15:11.263]  Ashcroft says there is no Patriot Act 2, there's no second terrorism bill.
[00:15:11.784 --> 00:15:12.624]  It's a lie.
[00:15:13.849 --> 00:15:21.997]  Now, in Bill version, it was transmitted to the Library of Congress, the Legislative Control Sheet.
[00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:24.200]  And that's in the House.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.722]  Finished legislation for review.
[00:15:27.223 --> 00:15:28.284]  But forget that.
[00:15:28.504 --> 00:15:29.825]  That's a smokescreen.
[00:15:30.646 --> 00:15:34.149]  We then found out that at the point, the week we found out of Patriot Act II...
[00:15:35.433 --> 00:15:55.767]  That three and a half months before S-22 had been introduced, the Justice Domestic Security Enhancement Act, the House version is the Domestic Security Enhancement Act, one word different in the title, much larger bill, all the provisions that are in Patriot Act II in the House, and more.
[00:15:56.813 --> 00:15:57.714]  We're good to go.
[00:15:58.274 --> 00:15:59.375]  We're good to go.
[00:16:23.642 --> 00:16:38.126]  I suggest you go to InfoWars.com, you get my six-page analysis, and you email it to every radio station, every TV station, every single newspaper in the country.
[00:16:38.607 --> 00:16:44.548]  Pick ten, email it to them, and point out, S-22 is the Patriot Act 2.
[00:16:45.108 --> 00:16:46.049]  It's been introduced.
[00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:50.190]  So, again, it's the same tactic over and over again.
[00:16:51.622 --> 00:16:55.685]  The government, five years ago, would say, there is no New World Order.
[00:16:56.506 --> 00:16:59.929]  Anyone that says there is, is a terrorist or mentally ill.
[00:17:00.289 --> 00:17:03.572]  The training manuals actually say this.
[00:17:04.378 --> 00:17:24.368]  They recommend to police officers in the FBI written advisory notes and intelligence reports, if someone has anti-UN stickers, if they talk about the loss of sovereignty, if they talk about the attack on the Bill of Rights, go ahead and arrest them, take them in and make sure everything's all right.
[00:17:25.769 --> 00:17:29.251]  And then we have video police at checkpoints doing just that.
[00:17:30.074 --> 00:17:32.815]  They say in Megiddo Report, there's no New World Order.
[00:17:32.895 --> 00:17:35.116]  If someone believes in it, they're a terrorist.
[00:17:35.676 --> 00:17:41.158]  Now, this is why presidents and prime ministers and globalist think tanks are calling it the New World Order.
[00:17:41.458 --> 00:17:52.042]  Top military brass are having meetings, symposiums about the New World Order, calling for global government, calling for national ID cards, calling for giant prison camps, calling for total enslavement.
[00:17:53.937 --> 00:17:55.638]  And then now they're out in the open.
[00:17:55.678 --> 00:17:57.458]  New World Order this, New World Order that.
[00:17:57.498 --> 00:18:03.360]  I mean, just type in Democrats call for New World Order, Republicans call for New World Order, Neocons call for New World Order.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.401]  Just type New World Order into a search engine.
[00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:10.502]  Hundreds of mainstream articles will pop up from the last month on this.
[00:18:10.862 --> 00:18:12.463]  They're all over TV saying it.
[00:18:13.303 --> 00:18:16.664]  Still, you say New World Order, it doesn't exist.
[00:18:16.904 --> 00:18:18.484]  You're crazy.
[00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:20.725]  It doesn't exist.
[00:18:21.405 --> 00:18:22.586]  You're crazy.
[00:18:22.626 --> 00:18:34.377]  I know I make this point a lot because here they are with an introduced bill, Patriot Act II, it's what it is, what it does, and here's the paper saying it doesn't exist.
[00:18:35.278 --> 00:18:38.841]  Just Alice in Wonderland, fruitcake insanity.
[00:18:40.063 --> 00:18:42.525]  I mean, this is what we're facing, just total denial.
[00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:51.453]  The idea was outlined in a Justice Department document, the article continues, Domestic Security Enhancement Act 2003, which was leaked this year to a political watchdog group.
[00:18:51.473 --> 00:19:09.098]  The proposal would let the government obtain telephone records, bank statements, and credit cards in terrorism cases with little or no court supervision and increase its power to make secret arrests and collect DNA samples from suspects, yes, suspects of all crime, and secretly arrest you and secretly execute you.
[00:19:10.367 --> 00:19:23.452]  It also would end many court-approved limits on police surveillance of religious and political activities and grant the Attorney General the power to script the citizenship of any American who joins or provides support to a designated terrorist group.
[00:19:23.492 --> 00:19:26.153]  And that's proactively and retroactively.
[00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:29.935]  And it says you don't even have to commit a crime to be secretly arrested.
[00:19:29.955 --> 00:19:33.356]  Anyone that says that you were secretly arrested can be secretly arrested.
[00:19:33.376 --> 00:19:36.177]  It is something that Stalin didn't put on paper.
[00:19:36.598 --> 00:19:37.738]  I've read the thing, okay?
[00:19:37.918 --> 00:19:39.699]  We're counting on you not reading it.
[00:19:40.139 --> 00:19:40.839]  Go read it.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.280]  But here it is.
[00:19:43.301 --> 00:19:49.503]  It says here, the Justice Department denies that it even exists.
[00:19:50.664 --> 00:19:52.905]  It's in the Senate S-22.
[00:19:56.688 --> 00:19:57.969]  S-22!
[00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.310]  S-22!
[00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.733]  We have now reached into a level of Alice in Wonderland with this government.
[00:20:06.413 --> 00:20:07.374]  It is unbelievable.
[00:20:07.394 --> 00:20:08.594]  We'll be right back with more news.
[00:20:10.095 --> 00:20:10.856]  Are you prepared?
[00:20:11.036 --> 00:20:13.437]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[00:20:13.657 --> 00:20:18.079]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.861]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[00:20:22.082 --> 00:20:24.243]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[00:20:24.583 --> 00:20:24.923]  Jerry Good
[00:20:24.963 --> 00:20:25.564]  We're good to go.
[00:20:52.185 --> 00:20:56.850]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.

[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.720]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:13.684]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a roadmap?
[00:23:13.884 --> 00:23:15.325]  And how easy it would be to get lost?
[00:23:15.625 --> 00:23:17.006]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[00:23:17.026 --> 00:23:19.328]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[00:23:19.788 --> 00:23:22.629]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:23.029]  coins.
[00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:24.509]  The Red Book Guide to U.S.
[00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:30.111]  Coins and History provides you with the knowledge you'll need to make informed decisions when it comes to collecting and investing in U.S.
[00:23:30.151 --> 00:23:31.091]  gold and silver coins.
[00:23:31.391 --> 00:23:34.192]  The year 2003 edition of the Red Book, A Guide to U.S.
[00:23:34.232 --> 00:23:41.134]  Coins, has hit the bookstores and Ted Anderson of Midas Resources wants to help you be one of the very first to own this guide with a very special offer.
[00:23:41.434 --> 00:23:46.216]  For a limited time, Midas Resources is offering the 2003 Red Book and a U.S.
[00:23:46.436 --> 00:23:49.258]  90% silver dollar over a $20 value for only $15.

[00:24:13.388 --> 00:24:13.888]  Don't worry.
[00:24:14.349 --> 00:24:15.869]  This show is documented.
[00:24:16.389 --> 00:24:19.191]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:19.571 --> 00:24:23.093]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:24:23.113 --> 00:24:27.615]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:30.156]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:24:30.216 --> 00:24:34.438]  So, the middle class thinks that Lord Bush is going to protect them.
[00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:44.294]  If they just accept being part of the new global empire, again the headline, Chicago Tribune, the American empire, like it or not, it's reality.
[00:24:44.394 --> 00:24:45.014]  Embrace it.
[00:24:45.114 --> 00:24:46.115]  Get used to it.
[00:24:47.595 --> 00:24:50.757]  And you talk to the yuppies, they go, oh, well, we are an empire.
[00:24:51.157 --> 00:24:52.958]  It's to keep our stock market high.
[00:24:53.278 --> 00:24:54.138]  Fools!
[00:24:55.799 --> 00:25:00.921]  A globalist said three and a half years ago at Davos, Switzerland, that they plan to devalue the dollar.
[00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:07.276]  And they're doing it right now with the Euro trading $1.17 to the dollar.
[00:25:08.077 --> 00:25:12.319]  Just a couple years ago, it was trading 90 cents to the dollar.
[00:25:12.339 --> 00:25:14.180]  Do you know what that means?
[00:25:14.821 --> 00:25:19.963]  All we had left in this country was the strong fiat World Reserve currency.
[00:25:20.404 --> 00:25:22.525]  That meant we could buy cheap goods.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.160]  I think we're good to go.
[00:25:45.583 --> 00:25:59.056]  And they've told you this war is going to last 100 years against this shadowy enemy, and now they say Al-Qaeda is reconstituting itself meaner and bigger than ever.
[00:25:59.096 --> 00:26:00.137]  They're going to hit us.
[00:26:00.498 --> 00:26:01.599]  They're going to get us.
[00:26:01.819 --> 00:26:02.760]  Oh, it's all over.
[00:26:04.338 --> 00:26:17.804]  But don't worry, they've got Operation Top-Off 2, what you should call Operation Hysteria, to scare you into submission, to practice taking over our counties and cities and states, and we're going to cover that coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:26:18.584 --> 00:26:22.486]  Now the globalists are having to replace their minions in Iraq.
[00:26:23.506 --> 00:26:29.889]  They're having to put new people in as cholera spreads and as the society completely breaks down.
[00:26:29.929 --> 00:26:33.691]  There's no way to hide the truth of what's developing.
[00:26:34.258 --> 00:26:34.979]  I think we're good to go.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:49.940]  The U.S.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:57.204]  sacks its woman in Baghdad, Washington, replaces its team for the anarchy-hit capital after failures.
[00:26:57.225 --> 00:26:57.645]  The U.S.
[00:26:57.685 --> 00:27:06.530]  yesterday sacked one of its most senior envoys through Iraq after only three weeks in admission that the task of running the country is proving tougher than expected.
[00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:15.315]  With Baghdad still in a state of chaos, there was a whiff of panic about Washington's removal of a top layer of its team responsible for reconstruction.
[00:27:15.335 --> 00:27:18.517]  There was also a hint that it is bringing force to
[00:27:19.136 --> 00:27:19.957]  If this is a...
[00:27:49.844 --> 00:27:51.225]  This is a consulship.
[00:27:51.286 --> 00:27:52.627]  Where is the ambassador?
[00:27:52.747 --> 00:27:56.310]  Also, you can't judge these books by their covers.
[00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.891]  The L.A.
[00:27:56.991 --> 00:28:03.417]  Times, many textbooks, distort history, slamming the U.S.
[00:28:03.537 --> 00:28:06.240]  and glorifying despotic regimes.
[00:28:06.997 --> 00:28:08.257]  Last week, the L.A.
[00:28:08.337 --> 00:28:11.598]  Times had an article saying McCarthy was right.
[00:28:11.978 --> 00:28:13.218]  What is going on?
[00:28:13.538 --> 00:28:15.919]  The liberal papers sound conservative.
[00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:18.339]  The conservative papers sound liberal.
[00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:21.300]  I mean, they're really scrambling things right now.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.260]  And it goes on.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:28.821]  You know, I bought a textbook, a world history textbook for eighth graders a few years ago.
[00:28:29.801 --> 00:28:31.642]  And the thing says, I ought to dig it back out.
[00:28:31.662 --> 00:28:32.462]  It's over there on the shelf.
[00:28:32.522 --> 00:28:33.162]  I can see it.
[00:28:34.102 --> 00:28:36.083]  This is used in Texas and many other states.
[00:28:36.203 --> 00:28:45.029]  It says that Mao helped the people, and that his cultural revolution was good, and that women got rights.
[00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:51.732]  But it says that there is no individual right to keep and bear arms in the United States.
[00:28:52.413 --> 00:28:56.555]  Mao's good, Second Amendment bad.
[00:28:56.675 --> 00:29:00.938]  Yes, I'd say that's, again, Alice in Wonderland crazy.
[00:29:02.225 --> 00:29:08.910]  And this article says here, 15 years ago, I helped write the guidelines for teaching history in California, the writer says, and public schools.
[00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:20.398]  Those guidelines drafted by a committee of teachers and historians and approved by the State Board of Education won national praise for their insistence that students should learn the importance of democratic institutions, human rights, and the rule of law.
[00:29:21.258 --> 00:29:33.888]  Last year, while doing research for a book, I read two dozen leading textbooks in the world and American history, including many of those used in California schools, and I was surprised to find that the spread of democratic ideas is no longer a central theme.
[00:29:35.289 --> 00:29:39.972]  And the article goes on to say that slavery and dictatorship are promoted as good.
[00:29:40.493 --> 00:29:41.553]  That's right, they are.
[00:29:42.234 --> 00:29:44.235]  Mao is good, America is bad.
[00:29:46.257 --> 00:29:50.220]  We'll come back, get into the economic news, the 9-1-1 cover-up news.
[00:29:51.596 --> 00:29:54.818]  From the Washington Times and much more.
[00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:56.099]  It's all coming up.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.503]  Infowars.com We're on the march.
[00:30:01.964 --> 00:30:03.585]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.486 --> 00:30:07.188]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.422 --> 00:30:17.285]  As a listener to the Genesis Communications Network you're aware of the many health dangers that have been unleashed upon an unsuspecting public.
[00:30:17.725 --> 00:30:21.126]  We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones but how do we do that?
[00:30:32.796 --> 00:30:37.941]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:40.903]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.641]  All right, welcome back, folks.
[00:30:47.661 --> 00:30:49.002]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:30:49.042 --> 00:30:56.669]  The toll-free number to join me on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:30:56.769 --> 00:31:06.277]  Coming up, more on the economy and more on how America is now a global empire and how inside the empire you'll be more enslaved than anyone else inside the empire.
[00:31:07.618 --> 00:31:08.439]  But listen to this.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.483]  This is now in the Belfast Telegraph.
[00:31:12.643 --> 00:31:13.664]  It is in the BBC.
[00:31:14.765 --> 00:31:16.387]  It is in the London Guardian.
[00:31:17.247 --> 00:31:21.331]  Top double agent in IRA guilty of up to 40 murders.
[00:31:22.272 --> 00:31:35.845]  Turns out that the top man in the IRA carrying out the bombings, the killings, the shootings, everything, as we told you last year, was MI5-6 ultra-secret agent.
[00:31:41.136 --> 00:31:49.724]  And it came out last year that when Margaret Thatcher got into office, this is 24 years ago, the order went out to turn up the heat.
[00:31:50.705 --> 00:32:00.253]  Everything from kneecappings to school bus bombings was carried out, not by the IRA, but by British intelligence, MI5, MI6, and Army Intel.
[00:32:01.274 --> 00:32:02.616]  They carried the bombings out.
[00:32:03.176 --> 00:32:04.777]  They blamed it on their political enemies.
[00:32:04.818 --> 00:32:06.299]  This is a British trick.
[00:32:07.106 --> 00:32:10.527]  They have been big in it before the Russians or the U.S.
[00:32:10.587 --> 00:32:10.907]  were.
[00:32:11.687 --> 00:32:15.569]  Of course, Putin was caught blowing up or trying to blow up his fourth apartment building.
[00:32:15.609 --> 00:32:16.689]  Did blow up three of them.
[00:32:17.289 --> 00:32:21.410]  Moscow police arrested FSB in 1999, planting the bombs.
[00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.391]  And then Moscow...
[00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:32.913]  GRU, their internal security force, went in and arrested the police and others that had the hexogen explosives.
[00:32:33.353 --> 00:32:36.514]  They arrested members of the media, and that story was shut down quite quickly.
[00:32:36.874 --> 00:32:41.055]  But that is confirmed, and members of the FSB and others have now spoken out who fled the country.
[00:32:41.495 --> 00:32:46.197]  Then Britain moved to have them arrested and shipped back to Vladimir Putin.
[00:32:47.443 --> 00:32:53.008]  Who was the former head of the KGB in Stalingrad, Leningrad, St.
[00:32:53.028 --> 00:32:55.590]  Petersburg, whatever name you want to give it for the day.
[00:32:55.971 --> 00:32:56.471]  It's now St.
[00:32:56.491 --> 00:32:57.612]  Petersburg, the old name.
[00:32:58.913 --> 00:33:08.481]  And he was the guy really running things when they were pushing Boris Yeltsin around in a wheelchair, completely drunk and drugged out of his mind, who couldn't even speak.
[00:33:09.502 --> 00:33:13.446]  He's been running things for at least the last three years of Yeltsin's tenure.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.020]  We're good to go.
[00:33:37.516 --> 00:33:46.503]  One of the Chechnyan leaders said via satellite cell phone to the French news as a smart bomb honed in on the satellite phone and blew him to pieces.
[00:33:47.123 --> 00:33:49.205]  His last words, we didn't do it.
[00:33:49.605 --> 00:33:50.486]  Why would we do it?
[00:33:50.566 --> 00:33:51.727]  And bring the wrath down.
[00:33:51.787 --> 00:33:52.747]  That is ridiculous.
[00:33:53.248 --> 00:33:53.708]  Boom!
[00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:01.634]  And so, I'm sorry I got off into Russia blowing things up to pose as the Savior and crack down on the people.
[00:34:02.461 --> 00:34:08.085]  The Belfast Telegraph top double agent in IRA guilty of up to 40 murders.
[00:34:08.665 --> 00:34:15.309]  The agent known as Steakknife was named yesterday as Alfredo Freddy Scapecchi.
[00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:23.134]  For almost 30 years, a man whom the IRA believed was one of their own was paid 80,000 pounds salary a year.
[00:34:23.154 --> 00:34:23.975]  That's what...
[00:34:25.167 --> 00:34:32.193]  $160,000 a year by Force Research Unit, the top secret intelligence section of British Army.
[00:34:32.653 --> 00:34:44.442]  That's why you find British Intelligence and the Army Intelligence and MI5, Internal and MI6, their CIA, all having fun, all controlled by Force Research Unit.
[00:34:45.791 --> 00:34:48.273]  Well, that'll get Echelon recording this show.
[00:34:48.293 --> 00:34:50.214]  I'm saying the name of that group.
[00:34:50.634 --> 00:35:06.065]  The highest-placed British double agent within the IRA, who served as the head of their own internal security unit, see, head of their terror unit, was allowed by the British handlers to kill them in unity both north and south of the border in order to protect his position within the terrorist organization.
[00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:08.266]  Now, notice that spin they put on it.
[00:35:08.627 --> 00:35:14.831]  But it's been pointed out in all these articles that there wasn't any terrorism that wasn't carried out by these people.
[00:35:16.926 --> 00:35:23.852]  In fact, it turns out that British Intel would torture members of the IRA, kneecap people, because they wouldn't carry out terror.
[00:35:23.892 --> 00:35:30.257]  They would refuse to cause a street brawl or to beat up Catholics or to beat up Protestants or to keep the fight going.
[00:35:30.877 --> 00:35:36.862]  And British Intel would drop by and blow one of your legs off and say, you'll follow orders now, won't you?
[00:35:38.456 --> 00:35:40.078]  And we're going to live under the same system.
[00:35:40.198 --> 00:36:03.799]  Once they get the troops on the streets, Constantina Wire around the federal buildings and the state houses and the courthouses, which they're saying they're going to do, the face scanners everywhere, once they get troops on the streets and train you to get rid of Posse Comitatus, they're going to activate the shadow government's terror teams, which they've already done in big ways, but they've set soft target ways and bring you lots of hysteria and fear.
[00:36:04.406 --> 00:36:12.374]  They're just running top-off drills now, training your local governments how to respond, and setting the precedent that the feds are the bosses.
[00:36:13.615 --> 00:36:15.276]  It's all out there, mainstream news.
[00:36:15.837 --> 00:36:25.486]  We haven't found a terror attack in modern history, anywhere in the world, of any size or scope, that wasn't carried out by the globalists.
[00:36:26.098 --> 00:36:36.970]  When I say globalist, I'm talking about the private banks and their private armies that control the top cabals, the compartmentalized cabals in all the intelligence agencies.
[00:36:37.451 --> 00:36:40.895]  And if you're having trouble with the historical fact of this, just look at motive.
[00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:42.412]  Who gets power?
[00:36:42.752 --> 00:36:43.773]  Who gets control?
[00:36:44.173 --> 00:36:45.655]  Who gets to expand control?
[00:36:45.955 --> 00:36:47.476]  Who gets to pose as our saviors?
[00:36:47.816 --> 00:36:51.059]  Who gets higher approval ratings when there are terrorist attacks?
[00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:55.523]  Then look at the evidence, the hard evidence of who's been involved in the attacks.
[00:36:55.883 --> 00:36:56.964]  Who cooks the bombs?
[00:36:57.224 --> 00:36:58.325]  Who trains the drivers?
[00:36:58.605 --> 00:37:00.227]  Who protects the personnel?
[00:37:00.567 --> 00:37:01.408]  It's the globalists.
[00:37:02.689 --> 00:37:08.674]  The average person in the Pentagon, the CIA, the FBI, even the White House is a good person.
[00:37:09.617 --> 00:37:17.853]  The average Democrat, the average Republican might be corrupt and might be a good old boy, but compared to the cabals that run things, they are nothing.
[00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:20.258]  And let's make this clear.
[00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:30.815]  That we have just a few thousand globalists and a few thousand operatives who are carrying all of this out, and then they have the scripts for the media with the media ownership.
[00:37:31.115 --> 00:37:32.295]  They follow the agenda.
[00:37:32.695 --> 00:37:39.559]  We have the power to save this country and, yes, the world if we have courage and stand up and tell the truth.
[00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:49.123]  So I'll get more into that later with Colonel Craig Roberts, Army Intelligence, Marine Corps sniper, police detective, best-selling author, in the next hour as we talk about government-sponsored terror.
[00:37:50.586 --> 00:37:51.827]  And your calls are coming up here in a minute.
[00:37:51.927 --> 00:37:56.731]  A minister quits, buildings burn, rubbish rots, so much for the reconstruction.
[00:37:56.772 --> 00:38:01.295]  London Independent, it was just another day in the process of getting Baghdad back to normal.
[00:38:02.216 --> 00:38:17.730]  Well, on his most normal days, when news is supposed to be slow, the U.S.-appointed health minister finally resigned, the time of a steady mounting public health crisis after a week of relentless pressure from doctors disgusted at the prominent past, the Saddam Hussein regime.
[00:38:19.013 --> 00:38:22.355]  And they are appointing back party leaders to almost every position.
[00:38:22.896 --> 00:38:28.059]  The people trained by the CIA in torture, espionage, oppression in the 70s and 80s.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.660]  It is a CIA government.
[00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:33.603]  They're appointing the scum again in Iraq.
[00:38:34.484 --> 00:38:44.351]  And I've heard the neocon, the ultra-big government pimps on air, saying that, oh, our government had an election in Mosul last week.
[00:38:44.511 --> 00:38:45.852]  Folks, they appointed 255 people.
[00:38:48.946 --> 00:38:55.588]  Our government appointed 255 people to, quote, vote on the new governor and the leaders.
[00:38:55.688 --> 00:38:57.089]  Now, that's not an election.
[00:38:57.369 --> 00:39:02.871]  When you appoint those who vote, give me a break.
[00:39:02.911 --> 00:39:05.652]  Continuing tuition breaks okayed for illegal aliens.
[00:39:05.672 --> 00:39:09.993]  It's not enough that in California they get double the tuition that American citizens get.
[00:39:11.511 --> 00:39:23.715]  Now in Springfield, Illinois, illegal immigrants will get a break on college costs by being able to pay in-state tuition at Illinois' public universities under a bill that flew out of the Senate Wednesday.
[00:39:24.175 --> 00:39:25.915]  Foreign ID cards gain support.
[00:39:26.335 --> 00:39:32.237]  Texas House passes a bill to accept all ID cards, not just from Mexico, but all nations.
[00:39:32.997 --> 00:39:34.398]  Now they've added a rider to it.
[00:39:34.458 --> 00:39:35.398]  It's now in the Senate.
[00:39:36.418 --> 00:39:37.899]  You can get these fake anywhere.
[00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:39.140]  They admit they can be fake.
[00:39:39.441 --> 00:39:42.363]  The border stays wide open, but you're going to be enslaved as a citizen.
[00:39:43.524 --> 00:39:45.125]  Here's one out of the New York Times.
[00:39:45.225 --> 00:39:45.485]  U.S.
[00:39:45.585 --> 00:39:49.748]  Army recruiter crosses Mexico border when a U.S.
[00:39:49.848 --> 00:39:54.932]  Army recruiter sought out two potential recruits at a Tijuana high school last week.
[00:39:54.952 --> 00:40:02.297]  He fueled a maelstrom of anger and gave credence to erroneous reports the United States recruits Mexicans as soldiers.
[00:40:03.118 --> 00:40:04.279]  Gave credence?
[00:40:05.271 --> 00:40:11.955]  The government announced that they will let someone become a soldier, even if they're illegal, and give them citizenship.
[00:40:12.895 --> 00:40:22.540]  They had a Washington Times article last year that said if you're a felon and a legal alien, and if you've committed rapes and arson and robbery, it said it in the Washington Times.
[00:40:22.761 --> 00:40:25.082]  They had quotes out of the bill that passed.
[00:40:26.102 --> 00:40:33.006]  But the New York Times says, and gave credence to erroneous reports, they just said that the U.S.
[00:40:33.086 --> 00:40:34.667]  Army recruiter was over the border.
[00:40:35.945 --> 00:40:37.246]  Folks, this is la-la land.
[00:40:37.266 --> 00:40:46.154]  It's like Ashcroft in the Washington Post today, or yesterday, saying that there is no Patriot Act II when the thing's been enrolled in the Senate.
[00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:51.579]  I mean, it's just la-la land.
[00:40:52.359 --> 00:40:53.861]  Last week, incidents appears.
[00:40:54.597 --> 00:41:01.720]  To be a mishap by an overzealous recruiter tracking down two youths who apparently expressed interest in the Army at San Diego Recruiting Office.
[00:41:02.041 --> 00:41:04.042]  But it took on greater importance for the U.S.
[00:41:04.202 --> 00:41:08.744]  at war with Iraq as a rumor persisted that would-be immigrants could get U.S.
[00:41:08.784 --> 00:41:10.365]  citizenship by serving in the Army.
[00:41:10.965 --> 00:41:11.605]  Rumors?
[00:41:12.106 --> 00:41:16.608]  Bush gave a speech at a military base three months ago.
[00:41:16.688 --> 00:41:19.109]  I've got it on tape saying this.
[00:41:19.629 --> 00:41:21.671]  Folks, I want to advise everybody.
[00:41:22.071 --> 00:41:25.694]  We have reached a new level of insane media lying.
[00:41:26.294 --> 00:41:30.057]  Or maybe this writer doesn't know what planet they're from.
[00:41:31.658 --> 00:41:34.360]  By the way, the New York Times is trying to act like you can trust them.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:40.104]  They're out there saying, okay, one of our writers lied for years, and we caught him, and you can trust us now.
[00:41:42.535 --> 00:41:56.460]  It goes, at least five Mexican-born soldiers, all of whom had immigrated to the United States years earlier, were killed in Iraq, and Mexican media sometimes depicted even second-generation Mexican-Americans who died in Iraq as another Mexican casualty in the war opposed by a majority of people in this country.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:04.023]  By the way, Bush says that we're friends with Mexico, we love Mexico, they're our buddies, they're going to open the border, they're going to have a Pan-American Union.
[00:42:05.023 --> 00:42:09.765]  Even though Mexico opposed the war, well, why aren't you mad at them if you're mad at France?
[00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:12.751]  France has 3 million Muslims, by the way, in it.
[00:42:13.711 --> 00:42:14.632]  You know why they said no?
[00:42:14.652 --> 00:42:18.113]  They'd get attacked if they didn't by their internal population.
[00:42:19.254 --> 00:42:21.135]  It's just reached new levels of ridiculousness.
[00:42:21.915 --> 00:42:23.856]  Jeremy in Indiana, you're on the air.
[00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:24.596]  Thanks for holding.
[00:42:24.616 --> 00:42:25.036]  Go ahead.
[00:42:25.056 --> 00:42:29.458]  Yeah, I don't know how much more of this stuff I can really take, Alex.
[00:42:29.738 --> 00:42:30.679]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:42:30.719 --> 00:42:31.299]  Did you not?
[00:42:31.319 --> 00:42:32.099]  It was all over the news.
[00:42:32.399 --> 00:42:38.722]  Did you hear him when Bush said that we'll give citizenship to these people if they join the military?
[00:42:40.497 --> 00:42:41.518]  No, I didn't hear about that.
[00:42:41.558 --> 00:42:42.979]  Well, that was all over the news.
[00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:46.622]  He gave a speech, and the New York Times says it doesn't exist.
[00:42:47.622 --> 00:42:53.127]  I heard about him giving amnesty to the Mexicans at one point.
[00:42:54.588 --> 00:42:56.249]  Did you hear about that?
[00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:57.630]  Of course, yes.
[00:42:58.231 --> 00:42:59.112]  Record amnesty.
[00:42:59.132 --> 00:43:00.733]  They wanted to give another three million amnesty.
[00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:04.531]  I got into the show late today.
[00:43:04.571 --> 00:43:07.893]  I was hearing you talk about the Chicago Tribune and the New American Empire.
[00:43:07.933 --> 00:43:14.276]  I was wondering where in the Chicago Tribune I could find that and what other papers and if you could give the page numbers even.
[00:43:14.617 --> 00:43:18.278]  Okay, we posted it on Infowars.com or it's being posted.
[00:43:18.318 --> 00:43:22.341]  We now post about 80 articles or more in a day, so it takes a while to update.
[00:43:23.261 --> 00:43:28.844]  It's Julia Keller and Marja Mills.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:40.502]  Chicago Tribune, and this was yesterday, the American Empire, like it or not, it's reality, embrace it, get used to it, is the headline.
[00:43:40.522 --> 00:43:45.243]  And there was another one in the New York Times, another in the Austin American-Statesman.
[00:43:45.403 --> 00:43:52.284]  I saw over the weekend and today, I didn't count, at least a dozen, conservatively a dozen similar articles.
[00:43:53.924 --> 00:43:58.165]  Why is it everyone wants to wait until the troops are kicking down their doors before they do something?
[00:44:00.057 --> 00:44:02.258]  Well, you know, I've had talks with yuppies.
[00:44:03.118 --> 00:44:06.040]  You know, wealthy, middle-class folks living in million-dollar houses.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.221]  And they go, yes, it's an empire.
[00:44:08.261 --> 00:44:09.181]  Yes, it's about oil.
[00:44:09.361 --> 00:44:10.401]  Alex, of course it is.
[00:44:10.441 --> 00:44:11.962]  We've got to protect America.
[00:44:12.262 --> 00:44:13.703]  We've got to ensure our way of life.
[00:44:13.783 --> 00:44:14.483]  And I go, wait a minute.
[00:44:14.843 --> 00:44:23.567]  The people that are taking everything you've got are the ones, the people that are breaking down the stock market, admitting they're plunging the dollar on purpose.
[00:44:23.927 --> 00:44:25.588]  These are policies of the government.
[00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:29.073]  They're not going to protect you.
[00:44:29.393 --> 00:44:31.435]  You're going to be enslaved in this empire.
[00:44:33.577 --> 00:44:34.978]  This is insane.
[00:44:34.998 --> 00:44:44.588]  The mafia got smart a few years back, or quite a few years back, and invested in the media instead of booze when booze actually became legal.
[00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:46.250]  Well, what the media did was this.
[00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:46.910]  And you're right.
[00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:48.672]  It wasn't just Italians involved in the booze.
[00:44:49.293 --> 00:44:50.514]  The mafia got smart.
[00:44:51.423 --> 00:44:59.168]  They have this idea in Hollywood and the rest of it that only Italians or Russians or Chinese have mafia.
[00:44:59.849 --> 00:45:00.589]  I live in the South.
[00:45:00.609 --> 00:45:01.350]  Let me tell you something.
[00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:05.352]  The Dixie Mafia from Texas to North Carolina runs things.
[00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:08.915]  They're allied with the big wasp mob from the East Coast.
[00:45:09.535 --> 00:45:12.417]  White wasps are the real mob.
[00:45:13.018 --> 00:45:14.999]  They control aircraft carriers.
[00:45:15.039 --> 00:45:16.440]  They control armies.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.421]  They own universities.
[00:45:19.142 --> 00:45:19.242]  The
[00:45:19.921 --> 00:45:26.183]  The Italian Mafia is the equivalent of a fire ant to a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:34.885]  The Italian Mafia is a little bug compared to the Wasp Mob.
[00:45:36.445 --> 00:45:37.645]  Well, yeah.
[00:45:38.146 --> 00:45:42.427]  I meant like Mafia or Cartel, the Syndicate, the Outfit, whatever you want to call it.
[00:45:42.487 --> 00:45:48.148]  They all got smart and invested in Hollywood and in the media and I don't understand how people can't
[00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:52.391]  They don't want to.
[00:45:52.511 --> 00:45:53.372]  It is scary.
[00:45:53.552 --> 00:46:00.917]  And as things get worse, the government's going to pose as the Savior while they are doing it to us, are going to pose as the Savior and squeeze us tighter and tighter.
[00:46:00.937 --> 00:46:01.677]  But let me give you the news.
[00:46:02.438 --> 00:46:08.381]  The morale is the lowest it's ever been at the Pentagon, according to the Washington Times, because people know something's going on bad.
[00:46:09.242 --> 00:46:11.683]  The morale is the lowest it's been with our police.
[00:46:12.384 --> 00:46:13.484]  They know something's wrong.
[00:46:13.524 --> 00:46:14.245]  I talk to them.
[00:46:14.921 --> 00:46:16.983]  They're all refusing a smallpox shot.
[00:46:17.003 --> 00:46:18.384]  They all know something's wrong.
[00:46:19.805 --> 00:46:23.588]  I have state police majors walk up to me.
[00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:25.730]  I walk into the cleaners.
[00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:28.672]  I randomly pull in to get my laundry.
[00:46:28.693 --> 00:46:29.894]  Oh, I put it in two weeks ago.
[00:46:29.914 --> 00:46:38.721]  What I'm saying is it wasn't some stage deal where the major and the state police was waiting to talk to me.
[00:46:39.161 --> 00:46:40.462]  I'm driving back from the studio.
[00:46:42.262 --> 00:46:49.904]  A couple months ago, I decided to pull in to get my laundry just randomly, and there's a state police officer in there getting his uniforms.
[00:46:49.944 --> 00:46:52.324]  He goes, Mr. Jones, can you come outside, please?
[00:46:52.764 --> 00:46:55.885]  He goes, we were raised that this was the Soviet Union.
[00:46:56.705 --> 00:46:58.025]  We know something's wrong.
[00:46:58.045 --> 00:46:59.706]  The things we're being told are incredible.
[00:47:00.286 --> 00:47:01.406]  And I go, how many of you are awake?
[00:47:01.466 --> 00:47:05.147]  And he goes, most of the senior officers know something's wrong, Mr. Jones.
[00:47:05.847 --> 00:47:08.567]  DPS intelligence is fully aware of what's happening.
[00:47:09.167 --> 00:47:11.848]  And he goes, we know this isn't a conservative administration.
[00:47:12.891 --> 00:47:13.491]  Not this time, no.
[00:47:41.022 --> 00:47:41.543]  I'd forgotten.
[00:47:41.563 --> 00:47:42.683]  Oh, I know what I was going to ask you.
[00:47:42.824 --> 00:47:43.864]  One more thing, if you don't mind.
[00:47:44.225 --> 00:47:44.565]  Sure.
[00:47:44.605 --> 00:47:48.668]  These drills today that they're going to be doing in about 15 minutes, I guess?
[00:47:48.848 --> 00:47:56.374]  Yeah, the fake radiation attack in Seattle, stuff in Chicago, all training you to be a federal slave.
[00:47:56.755 --> 00:48:01.058]  These are supposed to take place for five days and raise the alert level, I'm told?
[00:48:02.159 --> 00:48:02.639]  Well, yes.
[00:48:02.719 --> 00:48:04.841]  Now during the drills, they're going to raise the alert level.
[00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:06.162]  Amber Alert will be flashing.
[00:48:06.382 --> 00:48:07.283]  Report gun owners.
[00:48:07.303 --> 00:48:08.044]  Report terrorists.
[00:48:08.064 --> 00:48:08.224]  Yes.
[00:48:09.051 --> 00:48:12.114]  And is this going to continue on for five days, and are they going to treat us?
[00:48:12.514 --> 00:48:14.596]  Are they going to basically put us under martial law for this?
[00:48:14.616 --> 00:48:15.837]  That's what this is, yes.
[00:48:15.857 --> 00:48:18.179]  This is a practice drill for martial law.
[00:48:18.199 --> 00:48:27.988]  When we get back, I will read you the article from ABC News about Operation Top-Off 2, training you to go under federal global control.
[00:48:28.669 --> 00:48:29.250]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:29.730]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:38.147]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:48:38.508 --> 00:48:39.869]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:42.272]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:48:42.432 --> 00:48:44.514]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:48:44.794 --> 00:48:49.719]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.104]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:48:54.344 --> 00:48:54.785]  We're good to go.
[00:49:09.241 --> 00:49:12.923]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowars.

[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:36.383]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:49:36.743 --> 00:49:40.825]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:41.126 --> 00:49:41.686]  We listened.
[00:49:41.986 --> 00:49:46.969]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:47.249 --> 00:49:47.730]  We listened.
[00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:51.152]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:51.572 --> 00:49:52.132]  We listened.
[00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:54.714]  You asked us to include an emergency light for
[00:49:54.974 --> 00:49:55.494]  We're good.
[00:50:22.485 --> 00:50:24.266]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:50:24.686 --> 00:50:28.347]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:51:40.935 --> 00:51:42.175]  All right, here's the article.
[00:51:42.495 --> 00:51:45.536]  ABC News, oninfowars.com.
[00:51:45.657 --> 00:51:47.917]  Officials prepare for bioterror drill.
[00:51:49.538 --> 00:51:52.980]  Federal, state, and local officials prepare for national bioterror drill.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:57.581]  This week, officials across the nation will have their hands full with an imaginary dirty bomb.
[00:51:57.601 --> 00:51:58.922]  Well, that's not a bioterror drill.
[00:51:59.302 --> 00:52:05.625]  In Seattle, and a fake threat of biological agent in Chicago, both part of a most extensive bioterrorism drill in the nation's history.
[00:52:05.645 --> 00:52:06.285]  These are giant...
[00:52:06.986 --> 00:52:10.849]  Shadow government, and they said this last year, test of taking over everything.
[00:52:11.429 --> 00:52:15.331]  Shutting down roads, mass quarantines, literal Hades.
[00:52:15.892 --> 00:52:22.856]  The five-day drill, set to begin Monday, is aimed at testing the ability of local, state, and federal authorities to handle terrorist attacks.
[00:52:22.896 --> 00:52:26.299]  It is the first large-scale counterterrorism exercise since September 11, 2001.
[00:52:26.379 --> 00:52:29.301]  Terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C.
[00:52:29.321 --> 00:52:34.464]  The exercise, which are being spearheaded by the Department of Homeland Security, will cost an estimated $16 million.
[00:52:34.824 --> 00:52:35.305]  We're good to go.
[00:52:49.557 --> 00:52:59.745]  Before I go to Dan in Illinois and others, you want to see the fake drills before 9-1-1, the fake nuclear spills, the fake bio-attacks here in Austin, and it's now come out.
[00:53:00.746 --> 00:53:04.509]  The White House ordered them, under Clinton and Bush, to, quote, create hysteria.
[00:53:04.989 --> 00:53:09.513]  This is the equivalent of calling in a bomb threat, that's what it is, to get everybody scared.
[00:53:09.533 --> 00:53:11.775]  It's like the shooting drills at schools, all of it.
[00:53:12.275 --> 00:53:15.217]  Training you to load on the buses at gunpoint with your hands behind your heads.
[00:53:15.778 --> 00:53:16.899]  How to lock down the cities.
[00:53:17.958 --> 00:53:18.438]  It is an amazing...
[00:53:43.143 --> 00:53:45.103]  Two and a half plus hour.
[00:53:45.183 --> 00:53:47.184]  Two hours, 37 minutes to be exact.
[00:53:47.624 --> 00:53:48.064]  Film.
[00:53:48.084 --> 00:53:56.166]  I don't want you to get the videos unless you're going to make at least 10 copies to spread the word, to force them to multiply this information and tell them to make copies.
[00:53:56.726 --> 00:53:57.606]  The videos are $25.95.
[00:53:57.906 --> 00:54:01.587]  $20 if you order three or more of the nine films.

[00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:06.409]  Again.

[00:54:23.909 --> 00:54:27.110]  Order the videos.
[00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:38.833]  1-888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, LAMAR, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:54:39.694 --> 00:54:42.414]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement is now out.
[00:54:42.875 --> 00:54:47.016]  Dan in Illinois, site of the fake bio attack and the martial law drills.
[00:54:47.136 --> 00:54:47.796]  Welcome, sir.
[00:54:48.576 --> 00:54:49.797]  I'm not going anywhere near there.
[00:54:50.557 --> 00:54:50.977]  But, um...
[00:54:51.438 --> 00:54:56.552]  You were saying that the New York Times is denying that they're giving the missionary citizenship as an incentive?
[00:54:57.907 --> 00:54:58.647]  The missionaries?
[00:54:58.747 --> 00:54:59.747]  Well, the mercenaries.
[00:54:59.807 --> 00:55:00.247]  I'm sorry.
[00:55:00.868 --> 00:55:01.368]  Mercenaries.
[00:55:01.428 --> 00:55:09.709]  Well, I mean, it's an admitted Pentagon recruiting office that if you are an illegal or illegal but don't have citizenship, they will hire you.
[00:55:09.769 --> 00:55:11.330]  It's public in hundreds of papers.
[00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:19.831]  Bush has given speeches, and yes, they deny it and say, oh, this has really gotten bad because they caught Army recruiters in Mexico.
[00:55:20.271 --> 00:55:22.892]  Well, there was a cardinal I was reading in the L.A.
[00:55:22.932 --> 00:55:23.132]  Times.
[00:55:23.152 --> 00:55:24.032]  There was a cardinal.
[00:55:24.693 --> 00:55:28.995]  That was begging Washington to give these people citizenship before they got killed.
[00:55:29.835 --> 00:55:33.737]  I mean, that was right in the... Well, Bush gave a speech, remember?
[00:55:34.277 --> 00:55:36.438]  It's public policy for three years.
[00:55:36.978 --> 00:55:41.200]  The Washington Times wrote an article last year that said that even if they're felons, they're doing it.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:46.422]  I mean, this is, again, it's like Ashcroft saying there's no Patriot Act II.
[00:55:46.902 --> 00:55:49.823]  It's like saying that the sun doesn't come up in the morning.
[00:55:50.643 --> 00:55:53.425]  Well, you know, there's one question about the 9-11 story.
[00:55:53.445 --> 00:55:56.147]  I just got your DVD last Friday.
[00:55:56.167 --> 00:55:57.468]  I've only gone through it slowly.
[00:55:57.528 --> 00:55:58.689]  I'm in Oklahoma Park.
[00:55:59.249 --> 00:56:06.054]  But let me ask you, you say over and over again, Al-Qaeda is a CIA type of trained people, correct?
[00:56:06.514 --> 00:56:06.795]  Yes.
[00:56:07.895 --> 00:56:09.577]  These type of people don't commit suicide.
[00:56:10.577 --> 00:56:11.778]  Well, let me explain that.
[00:56:11.798 --> 00:56:15.201]  We believe, all the evidence says, those people weren't even on those aircraft.
[00:56:15.621 --> 00:56:17.562]  You know most of the hijackers have been found alive.
[00:56:18.123 --> 00:56:18.523]  Stay there.
[00:56:18.563 --> 00:56:19.604]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[00:56:21.846 --> 00:56:22.887]  Hi, this is Joyce Reiling.
[00:56:22.927 --> 00:56:25.910]  As a nurse, I know the dangers of toxins and heavy metals in the body.
[00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:31.435]  Chelation treatments can rid the body of these toxins, but it can be expensive, time-consuming, and inconvenient.
[00:56:31.535 --> 00:56:38.842]  But now there's... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:48.586]  Big Brother.
[00:56:49.267 --> 00:56:50.288]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:52.130]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:53.591]  You want answers?
[00:56:54.372 --> 00:56:55.252]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.272 --> 00:56:59.696]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:00.117 --> 00:57:04.180]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:08.443 --> 00:57:09.383]  All right, my friends.
[00:57:09.603 --> 00:57:10.103]  Welcome.
[00:57:10.123 --> 00:57:14.644]  We're already 30 seconds into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:57:15.164 --> 00:57:19.665]  Colonel Craig Roberts is joining us in about 30 minutes.
[00:57:20.246 --> 00:57:23.646]  Talk about government-sponsored terror, one of the most important subjects we cover.
[00:57:24.846 --> 00:57:26.687]  And I've got a bunch of other news.
[00:57:26.747 --> 00:57:36.669]  Turns out that, again, more evidence that the government ran the IRA and the Protestants and carried out most of the terror as a pretext for control in England and Ireland and Scotland.
[00:57:37.899 --> 00:57:38.760]  That's coming up.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:43.303]  Right now we're talking to Dan, and I guess he's in Oklahoma.
[00:57:43.904 --> 00:57:46.666]  And, Dan, you just got the Road to Terry on DVD.
[00:57:46.826 --> 00:57:47.687]  You had a question.
[00:57:47.727 --> 00:57:48.627]  Restate that question.
[00:57:49.308 --> 00:57:49.888]  I'm in Illinois.
[00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:53.011]  Okay, well, first you said Illinois, then you said Oklahoma, sir.
[00:57:53.231 --> 00:57:56.914]  No, no, I said I'm watching your DVD.
[00:57:56.974 --> 00:57:58.195]  I've got to the Oklahoma part.
[00:57:58.435 --> 00:57:59.255]  Okay, I understand now.
[00:57:59.275 --> 00:57:59.616]  Go ahead.
[00:57:59.716 --> 00:57:59.876]  Yeah.
[00:58:00.296 --> 00:58:00.556]  You see...
[00:58:02.057 --> 00:58:05.220]  Even without the evidence, they know that you have 100% on that.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.280]  You don't even think they were in the plane.
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:06.921]  I agree with you.
[00:58:06.941 --> 00:58:07.722]  They probably weren't.
[00:58:08.062 --> 00:58:13.406]  But even if they were, suicide is not the tactic of Al-Qaeda.
[00:58:13.686 --> 00:58:14.467]  They're soldiers.
[00:58:14.947 --> 00:58:15.708]  They're confusing.
[00:58:16.008 --> 00:58:21.232]  They're trying to portray them as if they're Palestinian people who are desperate to do those things.
[00:58:21.492 --> 00:58:23.093]  Well, here's the problem with 9-1-1.
[00:58:23.514 --> 00:58:25.716]  To even get into it would take three hours.
[00:58:25.896 --> 00:58:26.736]  It might win 100 miles an hour.
[00:58:28.163 --> 00:58:30.204]  The so-called hijackers, we know this.
[00:58:30.464 --> 00:58:38.588]  MSNBC, Washington Post, you name it, had their homes, their cars, their credit cards were all FBI, CIA, and some were Mossad-issued.
[00:58:39.088 --> 00:58:40.789]  That's been on Fox News everywhere.
[00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:47.192]  The new deputy director of the FBI admitted that Mossad was involved with them, trying to, I guess, get it off on the Israelis last year.
[00:58:48.353 --> 00:58:49.674]  That's all out in the open.
[00:58:49.754 --> 00:58:51.615]  We know that.
[00:58:52.835 --> 00:58:56.117]  Now it turns out that at least nine of the 19 are still alive.
[00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:58.833]  So that's a little under half of them.
[00:59:14.682 --> 00:59:15.803]  We're good to go.
[00:59:31.852 --> 00:59:55.729]  You know, all of this, the buildings unimploding, the size of grass picking up explosions, the firefighter tapes being seized, the government saying they malfunctioned, they didn't, Mayor Willie Brown being told not to fly, Ashcroft, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, being told not to fly, admitting it in the news, the head of Pakistani intelligence wiring 100,000 to Mohammed Atta, he's meeting with the House and Senate Intelligence Committee chairman two days before the attacks, his second trip in his life to the U.S.,
[00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:59.954]  Bush on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic before 9-1-1.
[01:00:00.715 --> 01:00:03.039]  All this together, then the motives.
[01:00:04.252 --> 01:00:04.853]  Then the U.S.
[01:00:04.873 --> 01:00:07.274]  troops massing in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
[01:00:07.334 --> 01:00:09.895]  Bush having the launch orders on his desk.
[01:00:10.236 --> 01:00:15.618]  Then claiming they never heard of plans to hijack jets and fly them into buildings when it had been all over the news hundreds of times.
[01:00:15.839 --> 01:00:18.680]  The Pentagon running drills of hijacked jet airliners flying in.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.403]  That day, the CIA running a drill of hijacked jet airliners flying into the New York and D.C.
[01:00:23.443 --> 01:00:24.043]  skyline.
[01:00:24.063 --> 01:00:26.444]  I mean, this was all on the record.
[01:00:26.704 --> 01:00:29.566]  That morning, the CIA's running a drill of flying planes into buildings?
[01:00:29.946 --> 01:00:31.507]  Come on, folks, don't be stupid.
[01:00:32.316 --> 01:00:34.916]  So you look at all... Then you've got Operation Northwoods.
[01:00:35.597 --> 01:00:40.397]  So, understand, these Arabs were just seen at the scenes at the airport.
[01:00:41.598 --> 01:00:43.498]  A bunch of them have been proven to be alive.
[01:00:44.058 --> 01:00:44.858]  That right there.
[01:00:45.078 --> 01:00:48.999]  So, oh, but the point is we can prove prior knowledge.
[01:00:49.019 --> 01:00:52.640]  We can prove they're not having real committees investigate prior knowledge.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.480]  We can prove they're taking our liberties while leaving the borders wide open.
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:00.261]  They're destroying what America is, what the flag symbolizes.
[01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:00.881]  Plus...
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.841]  They didn't use the right type of people.
[01:01:03.901 --> 01:01:05.502]  They're not suicide type people.
[01:01:05.722 --> 01:01:09.764]  But the point is, they've proven a bunch of them are still alive.
[01:01:09.824 --> 01:01:10.525]  Right.
[01:01:10.705 --> 01:01:16.068]  But they're even trying to get us to buy the people who have education, who have...
[01:01:17.188 --> 01:01:18.029]  Something to live for.
[01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:20.151]  Are ready to kill themselves into a building.
[01:01:20.632 --> 01:01:22.253]  Well, that's never been the Al-Qaeda M.O.
[01:01:22.273 --> 01:01:22.674]  You're right.
[01:01:22.714 --> 01:01:23.555]  They plant bombs.
[01:01:23.595 --> 01:01:25.537]  They leave every time somebody needs a distraction.
[01:01:25.897 --> 01:01:26.518]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:26.538 --> 01:01:27.138]  Appreciate it.
[01:01:27.439 --> 01:01:28.840]  More calls and more news coming up.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:28.940]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.000]  800-259-9231.
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.102]  Yes, I've had a lot of coffee, so strap yourselves in.
[01:01:43.999 --> 01:01:48.482]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:01:48.843 --> 01:01:52.926]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:01:53.226 --> 01:01:53.766]  We listened.
[01:01:54.087 --> 01:01:59.071]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:01:59.331 --> 01:01:59.811]  We listened.
[01:02:00.211 --> 01:02:03.254]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:02:03.674 --> 01:02:04.194]  We listened.
[01:02:04.675 --> 01:02:07.537]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[01:02:07.637 --> 01:02:07.817]  I think.
[01:02:34.576 --> 01:02:37.898]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[01:02:39.039 --> 01:02:41.720]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:02:43.181 --> 01:02:50.564]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:50.825 --> 01:02:55.567]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.787 --> 01:03:01.430]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:02.410]  We're good to go.
[01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:20.796]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:03:21.016 --> 01:03:27.778]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:03:27.978 --> 01:03:33.239]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:03:33.259 --> 01:03:33.659]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:41.869 --> 01:03:48.071]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:56.253]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[01:03:56.473 --> 01:04:03.736]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:04:03.996 --> 01:04:08.197]  Potassium iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[01:04:08.357 --> 01:04:08.918]  We're good to go.
[01:04:32.174 --> 01:04:35.236]  Call toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:04:35.916 --> 01:04:37.377]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:04:37.637 --> 01:04:39.058]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:04:39.118 --> 01:04:48.943]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:49.044 --> 01:04:49.304]  My friend!
[01:04:56.579 --> 01:05:02.063]  We don't have to go along with this New World Order, but we have to realize what the playing field is.
[01:05:03.945 --> 01:05:06.427]  Governments are always run by strongmen.
[01:05:07.327 --> 01:05:17.855]  And now we have a sophisticated plutocracy of private families that own the private central banks that buy and sell our politicians like so many marbles.
[01:05:19.517 --> 01:05:21.038]  They own our universities.
[01:05:21.078 --> 01:05:22.619]  They own our dominant media outlets.
[01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:25.235]  They are dumbing the population down.
[01:05:25.275 --> 01:05:30.959]  They are training us that we're going to have more and more terror, and we've got to give up our liberty, and that they're going to give us security.
[01:05:32.681 --> 01:05:35.043]  But they need us to go along with the evil.
[01:05:35.103 --> 01:05:36.764]  They need us to become tattletales.
[01:05:36.784 --> 01:05:39.706]  They need us to become Stasi secret police.
[01:05:39.746 --> 01:05:43.289]  They need us to buy their fraud for it to succeed.
[01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:47.773]  And the good news is they tried Henry Kissinger as the whitewash chairman of the committee.
[01:05:48.353 --> 01:05:51.236]  The new guy they appointed, the former governor, he had to resign.
[01:05:52.156 --> 01:05:53.198]  That's falling apart.
[01:05:53.859 --> 01:05:56.222]  They tried to force vaccinate 11 million people.
[01:05:56.262 --> 01:05:57.083]  They refused.
[01:05:57.403 --> 01:06:01.149]  So now they can't vaccinate the entire population with their deadly smallpox injection.
[01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:03.432]  That program is stalling for them.
[01:06:04.924 --> 01:06:25.201]  And as things get worse and worse, as the globalists consolidate more and more, it's going to be important for people to know that it was the bankers who said they were going to take their pension funds, and it was the bankers who said that they were going to destroy the dollar, and it was the globalists, the Europeans that own our central banks that are using America to carry out its dirty work, taking over sovereign countries.
[01:06:25.301 --> 01:06:29.284]  There is no fight between our government and the EU and the UN.
[01:06:29.584 --> 01:06:31.686]  They're all owned and run by the same people.
[01:06:34.036 --> 01:06:37.558]  And it's so important that we tell the truth, that we speak out.
[01:06:37.978 --> 01:06:44.801]  Middle class folks out there, you don't protect your pension funds and your 401ks and your businesses by going along with tyranny.
[01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:52.525]  By supporting the Patriot Act and saying, oh, well things have changed after September 11th, we have to give up our liberty to be safe.
[01:06:53.565 --> 01:06:54.226]  Wake up!
[01:06:54.406 --> 01:06:55.566]  Think about what's happening.
[01:06:55.586 --> 01:06:58.708]  They're taking your liberties, but leaving the borders wide open.
[01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:01.069]  It's a complete lie.
[01:07:01.687 --> 01:07:04.249]  And total massive fraud.
[01:07:04.709 --> 01:07:13.075]  And now, every day, almost every paper, they say, yes, it's a new world order.
[01:07:14.456 --> 01:07:15.957]  And what is a new world order?
[01:07:16.077 --> 01:07:23.122]  A world government with courts where there are no juries, where you can't fix your accusers, with a world ID card.
[01:07:24.361 --> 01:07:34.507]  With a standardized system, merging our governments through so-called trade pacts, merging our currencies, merging our social security systems, merging our militaries.
[01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:38.970]  They've signed deals to merge Mexican and Canadian militaries with our military.
[01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:40.231]  It's already official.
[01:07:40.751 --> 01:07:43.613]  They're merging our governments under the Union of American States.
[01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:48.816]  The average person still has no idea about giant historical movements.
[01:07:49.536 --> 01:07:52.158]  All because the news didn't publicize it.
[01:07:53.624 --> 01:07:55.145]  Here's the Chicago Tribune again.
[01:07:55.165 --> 01:07:57.966]  The American Empire, like it or not, it's reality.
[01:07:58.086 --> 01:07:58.666]  Embrace it.
[01:07:58.766 --> 01:07:59.626]  Get used to it.
[01:08:01.227 --> 01:08:02.347]  Mike in New York.
[01:08:02.487 --> 01:08:03.308]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:08:03.348 --> 01:08:03.788]  Go ahead.
[01:08:04.768 --> 01:08:05.188]  Yeah, hello, Alex.
[01:08:05.228 --> 01:08:05.929]  How are you doing?
[01:08:06.009 --> 01:08:10.270]  I just actually bought your new Police State 3.
[01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:12.171]  Right, it's shipping out tomorrow.
[01:08:12.231 --> 01:08:12.671]  That's good.
[01:08:13.992 --> 01:08:16.973]  One thing, are you aware of a guy by the name of David J. Meyer?
[01:08:18.533 --> 01:08:19.554]  Last Trumpet Newsletter?
[01:08:21.354 --> 01:08:22.515]  I'm a little familiar with the name.
[01:08:22.575 --> 01:08:22.715]  Why?
[01:08:23.317 --> 01:08:27.938]  I'm just wondering, because he actually has a very good newsletter every month that comes out.
[01:08:28.338 --> 01:08:29.578]  Okay, what else is on your mind?
[01:08:30.699 --> 01:08:45.142]  He basically says about the new KGB, working with the Soviet Union KGB, Evgeny Primakov, former head of Soviet Union's KGB, has now been hired as a consultant to Tom Ridge and the Homeland Security Department.
[01:08:45.462 --> 01:08:47.722]  And they tried to deny that, but it turned out it was true.
[01:08:48.283 --> 01:08:49.843]  Yep, and it's the CAPS-2 system.
[01:08:50.669 --> 01:09:01.797]  That everybody's going to have a threat file and everything from a threat file to, you know, they're going to attach it to... By the way, if you don't have good credit, you're going to be in the threat file.
[01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:14.647]  It's just like in Germany where your papers all list who you are and what you can do and what jobs you can have and can you work in agriculture, can you work behind the counter at a restaurant, can you work in a cab or a truck.
[01:09:15.265 --> 01:09:19.508]  Yeah, it is textbook maximum tyranny.
[01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:30.294]  I have Ridge on tape from last year on C-SPAN, head of Homeland Security, saying we'll all have cards to have jobs and troops are going to be in the factories.
[01:09:30.354 --> 01:09:36.558]  But they had on, did you remember when they had, what's his name, Colin Powell on?
[01:09:37.438 --> 01:09:39.278]  On one of his shows like two years ago.
[01:09:39.518 --> 01:09:43.279]  Yeah, and he said that Russia can't force him to take an initial ID card, but we will.
[01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:44.119]  Exactly.
[01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:45.439]  It's the Social Security number.
[01:09:45.599 --> 01:09:46.620]  That's what it was, basically.
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:47.100]  He blurted it out.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.280]  Yeah, an internal passport.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.200]  He blurted it out right on national TV.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.181]  He said your internal passport, yes.
[01:09:52.541 --> 01:09:53.241]  I have one more question.
[01:09:53.261 --> 01:09:54.221]  I'm sorry that it takes so long.
[01:09:54.601 --> 01:09:56.141]  Are you aware of a guy by the name of William Cooper?
[01:09:56.821 --> 01:09:57.501]  Of course I am.
[01:09:57.642 --> 01:09:58.482]  Okay.
[01:09:58.522 --> 01:09:59.182]  He said something.
[01:09:59.202 --> 01:10:05.623]  There's something on his website, and he has all his recordings from way back.
[01:10:05.643 --> 01:10:06.163]  Yeah, I know.
[01:10:06.516 --> 01:10:09.358]  But he has one thing about you being a liar.
[01:10:09.778 --> 01:10:10.779]  I understand, sir.
[01:10:10.799 --> 01:10:11.559]  That's a diversion.
[01:10:12.119 --> 01:10:13.640]  Total diversion.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.801]  I appreciate your call.
[01:10:15.622 --> 01:10:20.645]  Frankly, my show is not about, and most other shows are, and that's why we never get anywhere.
[01:10:21.285 --> 01:10:28.610]  My show is not about what this talk show host says or what that talk show host says in the patriot movement.
[01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.750]  I'm sorry.
[01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:31.511]  My show is not the gossip column.
[01:10:32.132 --> 01:10:35.694]  Most of the other shows are, and that's why they don't go anywhere.
[01:10:36.958 --> 01:10:43.424]  William Cooper became unstable in the last years of his life before he was gunned down by a SWAT team in his Arizona home.
[01:10:44.445 --> 01:10:48.308]  I called the guy up when he was in trouble with the IRS, calling for help, and said, I'd like to interview you.
[01:10:48.928 --> 01:10:53.712]  And he began cussing and yelling and saying, only I have the answers.
[01:10:53.792 --> 01:10:57.515]  Well, I want to just tell folks, I never got into UFOs and stuff you can't prove.
[01:10:57.555 --> 01:10:58.156]  Cooper did.
[01:10:58.176 --> 01:11:01.238]  And I don't know what Cooper's problem was, and I'm sad he's dead.
[01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:02.880]  I'm not going to sit here and talk about somebody who's dead.
[01:11:03.684 --> 01:11:30.022]  But the man took five hours, four hours of radio shows I did, edited it down to 25 minutes, and then gave me the, well, it's profanity so I can't say it, but the award of the century for a broadcast I did in 1999 where a caller called in on Y2K Day and said, ABC News is reporting that a missile has been fired from Russia.
[01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.276]  And I said, okay, we'll air a song.
[01:11:33.396 --> 01:11:34.997]  I'll go turn ABC News on.
[01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:36.318]  So I came back after the song.
[01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:38.280]  I was on with Michael Trudeau on his show.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.361]  I'd done three hours on my show, and I was doing his show.
[01:11:40.381 --> 01:11:47.167]  And I came back on, and I said, yes, ABC News said that some missile has been fired from Russia.
[01:11:48.628 --> 01:11:50.229]  ABC News said that.
[01:11:50.469 --> 01:11:59.797]  And then 10 minutes later, I go, okay, ABC News announces they had a general from NORAD, and he says that it was a scud out of Chechnya.
[01:12:01.835 --> 01:12:03.876]  We reported what they said.
[01:12:03.896 --> 01:12:13.458]  And then with that, Cooper ran with it and said, Alex says that Russia fired a missile at us and we're all going to get nuked.
[01:12:14.319 --> 01:12:16.239]  So talk about grasping at straws.
[01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:17.600]  And he took that.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.641]  He took that and he edited that.
[01:12:20.781 --> 01:12:25.022]  And then he had an edit for me on at night on the nighttime show.
[01:12:25.788 --> 01:12:35.773]  Where I talked about how our government was arming Russia so that they would have Topolin missiles and could reach our country with a new system of missile.
[01:12:37.274 --> 01:12:41.997]  And that was edited onto me talking about ABC News and the missile.
[01:12:42.517 --> 01:12:45.099]  So that was real nice and real friendly.
[01:12:45.459 --> 01:12:50.081]  And now, see, we've been completely diverted off of the real news.
[01:12:50.521 --> 01:12:51.282]  So that's sad.
[01:12:53.181 --> 01:12:55.422]  Very, very, very sad.
[01:12:55.882 --> 01:13:08.707]  And I would challenge people to stick with stuff you can prove, like the Patriot Act, what it says, Section 501 of Patriot Act 2, or Section 213 of H.R.
[01:13:08.727 --> 01:13:10.808]  3162, the first Patriot Act.
[01:13:11.348 --> 01:13:19.671]  I would stick to the Knight Rider newspaper last week saying, Knight Rider News Service, neocons call for a new world order.
[01:13:21.252 --> 01:13:22.272]  I would stick to that.
[01:13:23.383 --> 01:13:25.805]  I would stick to this Chicago Tribune headline.
[01:13:25.825 --> 01:13:29.148]  The American Empire, like it or not, it's reality.
[01:13:29.288 --> 01:13:29.928]  Embrace it.
[01:13:30.469 --> 01:13:31.549]  Get used to it.
[01:13:31.609 --> 01:13:35.572]  See, that's out in the open.
[01:13:36.953 --> 01:13:42.698]  And it goes on to how we're now an empire and you'd better accept the...
[01:13:44.136 --> 01:13:46.498]  Dark historical connotations.
[01:13:46.758 --> 01:13:55.264]  There's been a huge shift in attitudes towards empire, which is Bruce Robbins, a Columbia University professor of English and comparative literature who was critical of the shift.
[01:13:56.384 --> 01:14:02.869]  Well, you know, Zygmunt Brzezinski, founder of the Trilateral Commission in 74, with David Rockefeller and...
[01:14:03.633 --> 01:14:20.325]  The peanut farmer, Jimmy Carter, said in his book, published in 98, A Grand Chessboard, God, pay me, I plug it so much, that they would use and needed Pearl Harbor events to unify the American people behind a war for global empire and a new world order.
[01:14:20.966 --> 01:14:26.450]  The Project for an American Century, the papers written by Rumsfeld and Cheney in 97 through 2000, say...
[01:14:28.667 --> 01:14:35.469]  At ProjectForNewAmericanCentury.org that they needed catastrophic terrorist attacks, that that was needed.
[01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:45.473]  Pearl Harbor events, I use that quote as well, against America to get us behind a national draft, a world government, a war for empire.
[01:14:46.834 --> 01:14:56.257]  So see, what I do on this show is I don't talk about the visions that some prophet had out in the desert who said the nukes are going to go off next week.
[01:14:56.815 --> 01:15:01.278]  And I don't talk about Planet X. And I don't talk about flying saucers.
[01:15:01.638 --> 01:15:03.379]  And I don't talk about psychics.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:10.384]  And I don't talk about other talk show hosts, unless there's some national host, like Sean Hannity saying every child should take a microchip.
[01:15:10.404 --> 01:15:12.125]  I have it on video of Hannity and Combs.
[01:15:12.746 --> 01:15:17.429]  Or if it's Savage saying, put anyone who disagrees with the government in a forced labor camp.
[01:15:17.529 --> 01:15:19.210]  I occasionally break my rule for that.
[01:15:20.491 --> 01:15:24.694]  But I don't talk about rumors and trash.
[01:15:26.056 --> 01:15:28.938]  I do not do it on this show.
[01:15:29.478 --> 01:15:40.184]  There's enough insane craziness to fill up the day and the night and to never have to speculate one single time.
[01:15:40.204 --> 01:15:44.467]  And that's what we do here on this show.
[01:15:45.347 --> 01:15:48.629]  If you want a bunch of garbage, you can get it other places.
[01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:51.491]  You know, we don't do that here.
[01:15:52.111 --> 01:15:54.613]  We talk about what the globalists are doing, their trend.
[01:15:55.393 --> 01:16:08.184]  I'm so accurate, I got on the air in July of 2001, and I said, call Congress, call the White House, tell them we know they're going to use Bin Laden to go after New York.
[01:16:08.244 --> 01:16:17.772]  Now, I did that on air dozens of times, I did it on TV, it's in the Masters of Terror, the clip of myself on TV saying it, warning people, putting out the phone numbers to Washington.
[01:16:18.812 --> 01:16:20.374]  I have real sources.
[01:16:21.184 --> 01:16:22.685]  Like David Shippers.
[01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:24.565]  Like Judicial Watch.
[01:16:24.866 --> 01:16:26.986]  But I have better sources than that.
[01:16:27.287 --> 01:16:36.090]  My own analytical skill of the propaganda they're putting in the media before they launch major accelerations of the program.
[01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:39.711]  The globalists are using terror to scare you into submission.
[01:16:40.132 --> 01:16:41.112]  That's what's important.
[01:16:43.115 --> 01:16:46.781]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:52.610]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:16:53.091 --> 01:16:54.152]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:16:54.212 --> 01:16:58.199]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:16:58.895 --> 01:17:12.187]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:17:12.707 --> 01:17:18.012]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:17:18.312 --> 01:17:24.197]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:17:57.162 --> 01:17:57.422]  The book,

[01:18:29.284 --> 01:18:33.206]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.

[01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:53.272]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:55.533 --> 01:20:57.974]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:20:58.034 --> 01:20:58.915]  until 2 p.m.

[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.661]  Nine hours a day of this broadcast.
[01:21:13.271 --> 01:21:19.173]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dials, simulcasting on shortwave and the Internet at infowars.com and net.
[01:21:19.213 --> 01:21:24.015]  We have Colonel Craig Roberts of Army Intelligence joining us in the next segment.
[01:21:24.035 --> 01:21:24.735]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:21:25.375 --> 01:21:27.796]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joan in Florida.
[01:21:27.856 --> 01:21:28.816]  Joan, good to talk to you.
[01:21:28.856 --> 01:21:29.177]  Welcome.
[01:21:31.217 --> 01:21:32.878]  I had a great mom's day yesterday.
[01:21:33.278 --> 01:21:35.899]  Oh, well, yes, I want to say we appreciate all the mothers out there.
[01:21:36.199 --> 01:21:36.899]  Yeah.
[01:21:37.319 --> 01:21:42.121]  Real quick, the other day, Ed Case, Representative Ed Case,
[01:21:42.682 --> 01:21:44.563]  Democrat of Hawaii.
[01:21:45.064 --> 01:21:48.486]  Democrat... Congressman.
[01:21:48.906 --> 01:21:49.487]  Congressman.
[01:21:50.327 --> 01:21:51.088]  Hawaii.
[01:21:51.768 --> 01:22:05.278]  The House of Representatives and the Senate both passed a resolution concerning Patriot 2, the Bill of Rights, and... Not the Bill of Rights.
[01:22:05.318 --> 01:22:06.439]  You know what I'm saying, honey.
[01:22:06.479 --> 01:22:07.239]  I'm so upset right now.
[01:22:07.259 --> 01:22:08.380]  No, it's the Bill of Rights.
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.762]  Well, I mean, reaffirming the Bill of Rights and
[01:22:11.229 --> 01:22:14.810]  There are concerns over the Patriot Act.
[01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:18.711]  And now the neocons will have a field day saying, oh, look at the liberals.
[01:22:18.991 --> 01:22:23.632]  When the leadership of the Democrats helped pass it in the first place, they're all together on this.
[01:22:23.652 --> 01:22:25.332]  But you do have some low-level members doing it.
[01:22:25.672 --> 01:22:27.672]  And, yes, I do have that report, and that's good news.
[01:22:27.772 --> 01:22:30.073]  And one more quick thing.
[01:22:30.613 --> 01:22:35.474]  You know, you've had people on concerning the prison industry.
[01:22:36.234 --> 01:22:39.235]  Well, Representative Pete Holstra of...
[01:22:40.276 --> 01:22:43.260]  Michigan's Republican has H.R.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:43.260]  1829.
[01:22:44.722 --> 01:22:55.898]  I saw him on a colloquy with Mark Souder Thursday a week ago concerning the prison industries and how they're putting our small businesses out of business.
[01:22:57.559 --> 01:23:01.261]  A lot of good old boys, Jones, say, hey, make them prisoners work.
[01:23:01.361 --> 01:23:04.102]  The problem is most of the industry is now privatized.
[01:23:04.142 --> 01:23:04.962]  It is an industry.
[01:23:05.323 --> 01:23:17.447]  They're working for an average of 23 cents an hour competing against your jobs, from the lumber to electronics to furniture to... To uniforms for our military.
[01:23:17.527 --> 01:23:19.088]  Customer service, everything.
[01:23:19.148 --> 01:23:20.468]  It's taking our jobs.
[01:23:20.569 --> 01:23:21.549]  It's slave camps.
[01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:24.313]  Seven and a half million people in the system now.
[01:23:24.553 --> 01:23:29.841]  Real quick, John Ashcroft and the Justice Department want to expand it by 30%.
[01:23:31.384 --> 01:23:36.772]  And I asked my congressman's office, I said, well, what does that tell me if you expand your business?
[01:23:37.168 --> 01:23:38.709]  You need more workers.
[01:23:39.089 --> 01:23:41.590]  Does that say more of us are going to be in jail?
[01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:42.191]  Of course.
[01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:48.714]  Look, they have a CBS news piece, Joan, two years ago where they said there's a couple million in prison now.
[01:23:49.734 --> 01:23:51.515]  They said 3.3 million.
[01:23:51.775 --> 01:23:53.776]  They'll soon be 30-plus million.
[01:23:54.437 --> 01:23:57.658]  So they're out in the open saying all of this.
[01:23:59.259 --> 01:24:03.821]  Well, I wanted to give you the number of H.R. 1829.
[01:24:06.248 --> 01:24:07.109]  What does that bill do?
[01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:12.031]  Well, you know, to tell you the truth, I was away for my 50th class reunion.
[01:24:12.552 --> 01:24:20.976]  I didn't take notes, but Sauter and the other fellow, Mark Sauter and... Okay, what did they say the bill did?
[01:24:22.417 --> 01:24:24.778]  They were trying to restrict it in some way.
[01:24:25.158 --> 01:24:27.259]  So it's a bill to expand the prison industry.
[01:24:27.459 --> 01:24:29.560]  They admitted, oh, they're not for it.
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:30.561]  They're against it.
[01:24:30.601 --> 01:24:31.021]  Okay.
[01:24:31.181 --> 01:24:32.582]  And plus, they said...
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:40.928]  That the government is already building new plants, new buildings for expansion of the plants.
[01:24:41.168 --> 01:24:43.050]  Yeah, I mean, what did camps do in Germany?
[01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:45.632]  You had a bunch of prisoners next door to a plant.
[01:24:46.754 --> 01:24:47.074]  Right.
[01:24:47.234 --> 01:24:47.855]  It's incredible.
[01:24:48.255 --> 01:24:49.376]  Joan, I appreciate the call.
[01:24:49.957 --> 01:24:50.738]  Interesting points.
[01:24:50.838 --> 01:24:52.279]  Yeah, it's just incredible.
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:56.043]  And now our military is going to be made up of illegal aliens south of the border.
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:00.382]  And it's all over the news, and the government tries to deny it.
[01:25:00.522 --> 01:25:01.603]  It's just incredible.
[01:25:01.643 --> 01:25:06.646]  But yes, I did hear they'd gotten some resolution introduced to reaffirm the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:25:07.246 --> 01:25:08.627]  What could be wrong with that?
[01:25:08.667 --> 01:25:10.248]  You know, we're not the radicals here.
[01:25:10.888 --> 01:25:15.931]  The globalists are radically reengineering our society, destroying our liberties and freedoms.
[01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:19.813]  We need to get our Bill of Rights, our Constitution back.
[01:25:20.394 --> 01:25:22.255]  That's what needs to happen here.
[01:25:22.816 --> 01:25:23.577]  We're good to go.
[01:25:44.864 --> 01:25:54.212]  Even the LA Times admits they're glorifying many school textbooks, distort history, slamming the U.S., and glorifying despotic regimes.
[01:25:54.632 --> 01:25:55.413]  That's the headline.
[01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:57.694]  They don't just not teach the Bill of Rights.
[01:25:57.734 --> 01:25:59.536]  They teach that tyranny is good.
[01:26:01.137 --> 01:26:09.604]  And last week it was reported that the Strauss, the head of the neocons, the founder of the neocon movement, was against freedom, was against a free society.
[01:26:10.962 --> 01:26:13.123]  Well, it doesn't matter if it's the neocons or the liberals.
[01:26:13.143 --> 01:26:24.849]  They're all together, big government, open borders, globalism, gun confiscation, selling out our sovereignty, NAFTA, GATT, supercomputers to Communist China, protecting Bill Clinton, blocking Dan Burton's committee.
[01:26:25.269 --> 01:26:26.290]  It's the same story.
[01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:28.331]  Selling this nation out.
[01:26:29.171 --> 01:26:31.353]  They've gotten so confident, they're out of control.
[01:26:33.013 --> 01:26:33.934]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.394 --> 01:26:36.015]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.915 --> 01:26:39.617]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.791 --> 01:26:45.815]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:26:46.135 --> 01:26:51.061]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:26:51.321 --> 01:26:53.844]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they have inhaled.
[01:26:53.904 --> 01:26:54.185]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:26:54.205 --> 01:26:54.485]  Call today.
[01:27:06.707 --> 01:27:12.730]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:27:13.351 --> 01:27:16.332]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:18.713 --> 01:27:22.155]  My new film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, is out.
[01:27:22.875 --> 01:27:24.816]  Two hours and 37 minutes long.
[01:27:24.856 --> 01:27:26.437]  We want an intelligence briefing.
[01:27:26.457 --> 01:27:30.279]  We want an education on the overview, the globalist master plan.
[01:27:30.299 --> 01:27:33.681]  We want to know about Patriot Act 2 in massive detail.
[01:27:33.701 --> 01:27:34.862]  40 minutes, 35 minutes of the film.
[01:27:36.238 --> 01:27:38.400]  It's about the Patriot Act and Homeland Security.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.422]  We've got about 40 minutes of it.
[01:27:41.562 --> 01:27:45.986]  It's about other examples of government-sponsored terrorism from Russia to the U.S.
[01:27:46.346 --> 01:27:56.094]  to England, where they're admittedly engaging in terror, to Israel controlling Hamas, admitted carrying out the bombings as a pretext for political control.
[01:27:57.052 --> 01:27:58.532]  That's just some of what's in this film.
[01:27:58.612 --> 01:28:01.833]  Two hours, 37 minutes, 25.95.
[01:28:01.893 --> 01:28:04.313]  It's really the equivalent of three or four different videos.
[01:28:04.733 --> 01:28:06.994]  Incredibly fast-moving, well-documented.
[01:28:07.414 --> 01:28:09.174]  You want to wake somebody up, this is it.
[01:28:09.294 --> 01:28:16.355]  Get it, make copies, get it out to police, firemen, county commissioners, opinion makers in your area so they know what they're part of.
[01:28:16.495 --> 01:28:23.437]  And people in government wake up even better than those that are out of government because they've already heard or seen almost everything I'm talking about.
[01:28:23.817 --> 01:28:25.517]  I just connect all the dots for them.
[01:28:26.553 --> 01:28:34.855]  Of course, I have 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, two films about 9-1-1 and the globalist plan and how they did it and what's coming next.
[01:28:35.535 --> 01:28:36.275]  Great films.
[01:28:36.515 --> 01:28:42.676]  Nine films I've made total that we're offering at Infowars.com or net.
[01:28:42.696 --> 01:28:43.296]  $25.95 a piece.
[01:28:43.436 --> 01:28:44.276]  Order three or more.
[01:28:44.637 --> 01:28:47.197]  They drop down to $20 a piece, a big discount.
[01:28:47.577 --> 01:28:48.737]  And there's my book, 230 pages, only $12.
[01:28:53.624 --> 01:28:59.647]  Get the films, get the books, support the show, but more importantly, get the word out and expose what the globalists are doing.
[01:28:59.687 --> 01:29:00.887]  Toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:29:00.907 --> 01:29:02.508]  That's 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or net.
[01:29:02.528 --> 01:29:02.948]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[01:29:22.083 --> 01:29:29.769]  Or just write to me, and I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:29:31.130 --> 01:29:46.842]  And I'm going to be up in Kansas City with Colonel Craig Roberts and others this Saturday from 10 in the morning until about 7 at night at the Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center, 5200 Blue Ridge Boulevard between I-70, Kansas City, and Independence, Missouri.
[01:29:48.496 --> 01:29:49.798]  And you definitely want to come to that.
[01:29:49.838 --> 01:29:50.439]  It's sponsored.
[01:29:50.479 --> 01:29:53.222]  It's a benefit for KCXL 1140 AM.
[01:29:53.262 --> 01:29:54.724]  It's been carrying my show for three years.
[01:29:54.744 --> 01:29:57.047]  And we're on there, of course, right now.
[01:29:58.028 --> 01:29:59.850]  And you need to call the station.
[01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:03.094]  It's $15 to get in, and all proceeds go to the station.
[01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:05.846]  Because we believe in what they're doing.
[01:30:05.886 --> 01:30:09.208]  Colonel Roberts will have a two-hour PowerPoint presentation.
[01:30:09.228 --> 01:30:12.030]  We'll have another additional 30 minutes to take questions.
[01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:15.292]  So as long as he needs, I'll speak for several hours.
[01:30:15.752 --> 01:30:17.553]  Other people are going to be there, like John Stattmiller.
[01:30:17.893 --> 01:30:20.555]  You'll definitely want to come to that.
[01:30:20.795 --> 01:30:22.356]  And the radio station number is 816-792-1140.
[01:30:22.376 --> 01:30:22.436]  816-792-1140.
[01:30:22.456 --> 01:30:23.777]  That's this Saturday, Kansas City.
[01:30:31.514 --> 01:30:37.161]  All right, joining us is Colonel Roberts, best-selling author of One Shot, One Kill, and Marine Corps Sniper.
[01:30:37.982 --> 01:30:44.049]  He's written a new book with General Wheeler, Doorway to Hell, Disaster in Somalia.
[01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.930]  Excellent book.
[01:30:46.431 --> 01:30:48.033]  He's an expert on the New World Order.
[01:30:48.113 --> 01:30:50.897]  He's a colonel in Army Intelligence.
[01:30:51.889 --> 01:30:56.796]  Now retired, he was a detective, worked the Oklahoma City case.
[01:30:56.856 --> 01:31:05.048]  I'll tell you, the globalists carried that baby out, and he's up to speed and knows the paradigm, and we're honored to have him back on the broadcast today.
[01:31:05.088 --> 01:31:06.430]  Colonel Roberts, good to speak with you.
[01:31:06.650 --> 01:31:08.733]  Always glad to be back on, Alex.
[01:31:09.975 --> 01:31:11.335]  Something might be wrong with your phone.
[01:31:11.355 --> 01:31:13.136]  You might turn the volume down or something.
[01:31:13.396 --> 01:31:14.656]  Yeah, I don't know what's going on there.
[01:31:14.816 --> 01:31:15.917]  Oh, it sounds good now.
[01:31:16.197 --> 01:31:17.177]  Good to have you on, sir.
[01:31:17.897 --> 01:31:19.777]  I had to hit the anti-bug device here.
[01:31:20.018 --> 01:31:20.418]  All right.
[01:31:20.818 --> 01:31:28.099]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and what the New World Order is, how we stop it, and then I've got some news articles I want to throw at you and get your take on.
[01:31:28.119 --> 01:31:34.221]  Okay, well, you know, my end of this deal is finding the Achilles heels of what the globalists are doing.
[01:31:35.061 --> 01:31:38.342]  And about myself, I think most people know who I am and
[01:31:38.723 --> 01:31:45.408]  And go to my website and find out the rest at www.riflewarrior.com.
[01:31:45.648 --> 01:31:49.571]  Go over there and it tells a little bit about me and my background and some of the things I believe in.
[01:31:51.033 --> 01:31:58.558]  I did 26 years on the Tulsa Police Department, all sorts of different assignments from undercover to flying helicopters to SWAT team.
[01:31:59.519 --> 01:32:06.945]  I was one of the investigators that was assigned to help the FBI in the Oklahoma City bombing case and had a problem with all the lies that I was seeing there
[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:15.924]  And did everything I could to try to expose what was really going on behind the scenes with the Iraqi terrorist connections to the Philippines and all of that.
[01:32:16.024 --> 01:32:20.806]  You almost called him, he's Iraqi, so I think that would be a good term for them.
[01:32:22.156 --> 01:32:24.858]  It's one of those Freudian slips after you've been on the road for three days.
[01:32:25.699 --> 01:32:26.960]  It's Rackies, yes.
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:27.940]  It's Rackies.
[01:32:28.141 --> 01:32:29.782]  I think there's... I'm a sod Rackies.
[01:32:29.842 --> 01:32:30.082]  Go ahead.
[01:32:30.122 --> 01:32:32.724]  We may have coined a new phrase we'll have to investigate here.
[01:32:33.725 --> 01:32:41.691]  But then I had a parallel career after four years in the Marine Corps on active duty, a year of which I was in Vietnam in the infantry with a sniper rifle.
[01:32:42.311 --> 01:32:47.315]  I did a further 26 years in the National Guard and Army Reserves.
[01:32:47.992 --> 01:32:54.133]  Most of it being an infantry officer, but the last 12, 14 years or so, working in the intelligence area.
[01:32:54.253 --> 01:32:57.314]  And your dad worked overseas in some CIA projects.
[01:32:57.374 --> 01:32:58.234]  You grew up around it.
[01:32:58.674 --> 01:33:00.434]  Oh, I grew up in a whole family full of spooks.
[01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:01.955]  I think I'm the only non-spook there.
[01:33:03.315 --> 01:33:09.796]  So I had a lot of assets and resources to help me write some of the books, like the Medusa File and Kill Zone, that other people didn't have access to.
[01:33:10.496 --> 01:33:14.917]  So I was able to do a lot in that area, but it was during this time that I stumbled upon
[01:33:15.781 --> 01:33:23.884]  Over and over, the same names, the same money, the same power, the same agendas that are global socialist in nature, and basically... And let's get it out right now.
[01:33:24.044 --> 01:33:27.745]  George Bush, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, they don't run the New World Order.
[01:33:28.385 --> 01:33:29.286]  Ted Schiller heads.
[01:33:30.026 --> 01:33:32.307]  Well, yeah, it goes up a lot higher than their pay grade.
[01:33:32.327 --> 01:33:36.768]  It goes up to guys like Kissinger and the Rockefellers and all that bunch, but it goes even above them.
[01:33:36.808 --> 01:33:38.429]  It goes to names we probably don't even know.
[01:33:38.939 --> 01:33:41.421]  They're the voices behind the voices behind the throne.
[01:33:41.621 --> 01:33:48.326]  Well, I mean, with Crumps, Rothschilds, Saxe-Coburg, Gotha, those type of names.
[01:33:48.666 --> 01:33:53.310]  And you've also got some Mings and Lings and Satchimos and Cachicos in there.
[01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:54.791]  I mean, we have Asians in this thing.
[01:33:54.831 --> 01:34:02.977]  We've got, of course, Russians, European monarchies, big bank players, and so on, on the side of just pure evil.
[01:34:03.678 --> 01:34:05.439]  Their thing is a new world order.
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:07.501]  The global socialist...
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:13.883]  Well, it's a multifaceted attack, and if you plotted this out with military generals, you couldn't have done a better job.
[01:34:36.755 --> 01:34:39.956]  You destroy the borders by two things.
[01:34:40.136 --> 01:34:41.816]  Laws such as NAFTA and GATT.
[01:34:42.336 --> 01:34:44.396]  And at the same time, don't defend them.
[01:34:44.636 --> 01:34:45.837]  Well, that's how the EU began.
[01:34:45.877 --> 01:34:47.457]  It's a, quote, trade deal.
[01:34:47.497 --> 01:34:48.617]  They mislabel things.
[01:34:48.937 --> 01:34:50.817]  Now they admit it's the Union of American States.
[01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:52.738]  And now, as you hear this, U.S.
[01:34:52.818 --> 01:34:55.098]  Army recruiter crosses Mexico border.
[01:34:55.378 --> 01:34:58.579]  They admit they're recruiting illegals and legals.
[01:34:58.899 --> 01:35:00.699]  And the news tries to deny it, Colonel.
[01:35:01.179 --> 01:35:04.820]  Well, the thing about it is, you can catch them red-handed.
[01:35:05.253 --> 01:35:09.116]  But you'll never hear about it because it'll get spiked because the media is totally controlled.
[01:35:10.257 --> 01:35:12.139]  Print and electronic media, totally controlled.
[01:35:12.179 --> 01:35:18.444]  And other than shortwave radio and a few newsletters and websites, unless you dig, you're not going to find out what's really going on.
[01:35:18.464 --> 01:35:21.366]  Well, you know, we're now on in Boston, D.C., New York.
[01:35:21.406 --> 01:35:23.067]  Why don't you say hi to folks in D.C., Craig?
[01:35:23.948 --> 01:35:26.310]  Hey, all you guys in D.C., I know you remember me.
[01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:27.371]  I've been there a few times.
[01:35:29.183 --> 01:35:36.147]  What would you say to folks at the Pentagon and in Congress and others that we've read in the Washington Times, morale's the lowest it's ever been.
[01:35:36.507 --> 01:35:37.368]  Why is that, Colonel?
[01:35:38.048 --> 01:35:44.152]  Well, you know, it was real low during the Clinton era for a lot of reasons.
[01:35:45.173 --> 01:35:48.475]  I think morale is up right now over this Iraqi thing.
[01:35:48.535 --> 01:35:51.777]  Well, the general troops, they said the Washington Times said the Pentagon.
[01:35:52.483 --> 01:35:58.890]  Oh, the morale at the Pentagon, well, you have two class entities at the Pentagon.
[01:36:00.912 --> 01:36:08.840]  It's very interesting that you opened that door because my friends in star ranking up there have told me in the past that you have two cliques.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:12.103]  You've got the nationalist clique and you've got the globalist clique.
[01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:15.927]  And the word is pretty well filtered down through the ranks that
[01:36:16.286 --> 01:36:18.587]  Unless you do a stint on the U.N.
[01:36:18.607 --> 01:36:28.331]  side of the house, the blue hat side, or do a stint with the Council on Foreign Relations or something along that line, then you don't consider getting more than one or two stars.
[01:36:28.391 --> 01:36:30.732]  By the way, now they're showing a lot of generals on TV.
[01:36:30.792 --> 01:36:33.153]  It'll say former general and CFR.
[01:36:33.453 --> 01:36:35.214]  What is the CFR for those that don't know?
[01:36:35.454 --> 01:36:45.478]  Well, the Council on Foreign Relations is the American branch of the Royal Society of International Affairs of London, which is the old roundtable group sponsored by the Bank of England, which is basically the Rothschild family.
[01:36:45.885 --> 01:36:55.792]  They're the international globalists that started here in the 1920s, I think around 1926, and goes back to Edward Mandel House and the Rockefellers and all of that.
[01:36:55.832 --> 01:36:58.113]  But they are directly linked to the monarchies of Europe.
[01:36:58.133 --> 01:37:01.976]  They're directly linked to the Rothschild families and so on.
[01:37:02.096 --> 01:37:09.961]  And these people are the ones that, for the last 200 years, have tried to control this country by using a monetary system against us.
[01:37:10.061 --> 01:37:13.644]  And Lincoln ran afoul of them, and he was assassinated.
[01:37:13.684 --> 01:37:14.744]  Kennedy ran afoul of them.
[01:37:14.824 --> 01:37:15.725]  He was assassinated.
[01:37:17.344 --> 01:37:23.707]  And every time you try to tinker with what they've set up in the Federal Reserve System, the dog's just not going to bark very long.
[01:37:24.147 --> 01:37:35.813]  So basically the CFR now controls all three branches of our government by putting staff members or putting members of their organization into staff positions, including the Pentagon and including the military ranks, including the service academies.
[01:37:36.533 --> 01:37:40.155]  The White House staff always has between 60 and 80 CFR members.
[01:37:40.515 --> 01:37:42.076]  So when you see General Barry McGaffey,
[01:37:43.386 --> 01:37:51.292]  McGaffrey popping up on the TV screen as a talking head when we go into some country and says, member of the CFR, they don't even hide it anymore.
[01:37:51.692 --> 01:37:54.494]  They're coming right out and saying, I'm a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:37:54.514 --> 01:37:57.376]  That's like being a Rhodes Scholar is supposed to be some kind of great deal.
[01:37:57.716 --> 01:38:10.065]  And when you dig behind the scenes, you find out Rhodes Scholars are nothing more than little globalists who are trained show dogs to further the agenda of the Roundtable Group, which is the Royal Society of International Affairs in London.
[01:38:10.714 --> 01:38:15.919]  The same guys that get involved in all kinds of things that stretch everywhere from the streets of Punjab to Bohemian Grove.
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:33.696]  For those that don't know, the globalists called for a totally enslaved country, no borders, children taken by the state at age four, training dormitories, 85% tax rate, troops on the streets, a living Hades.
[01:38:34.795 --> 01:38:41.038]  Well, they have a vision of the future being one that is totally controlled for their own safety and well-being.
[01:38:41.608 --> 01:38:43.950]  And they can't have the masses rise up against them.
[01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:49.214]  So basically, it's disarm the masses and keep us so busy doing something else.
[01:38:49.335 --> 01:38:58.642]  Was it any surprise when the errand boy Bush, who's just a puppet like Clinton, is trying to reaffirm the Clinton gun ban, the magazine ban, and wants more gun control?
[01:38:59.043 --> 01:38:59.963]  It didn't surprise me.
[01:39:01.044 --> 01:39:10.312]  See, the only difference between Republicans and Democrats at that level is if the Democrats vote to burn down Washington, the Republicans want to phase in an over-two-week period.
[01:39:11.456 --> 01:39:12.556]  The end result is the same.
[01:39:13.316 --> 01:39:26.099]  Because when you get to that level, as our congressman here found out as a freshman, and he replaced Steve Largent and went to Washington, he came back and his eyes were wide because he learned that he didn't really represent us.
[01:39:26.299 --> 01:39:32.260]  He represented the good old boy group in Washington, and if he wanted to play along, then he would have money for re-election.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.560]  He would have perks and bennies.
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:35.360]  He would be given some choice assignments.
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:39.021]  If he didn't want to play along, he'd be shoved in a corner and the door slammed on his face and stand up.
[01:39:39.491 --> 01:39:44.693]  Very little chance of being re-elected because, you know, it's like, I think it was Lenin or Stalin won.
[01:39:44.773 --> 01:39:49.154]  As Stalin said, it doesn't matter who votes or how many votes.
[01:39:49.194 --> 01:39:50.375]  It matters who counts the votes.
[01:39:50.975 --> 01:39:52.695]  And these people control the vote counting, too.
[01:39:52.795 --> 01:40:00.138]  So, you know, we get into this kind of a scenario, and we have a deal where Washington is totally out of control of the people, and they do what they want to do.
[01:40:00.178 --> 01:40:06.760]  But Washington is only one tentacle of the beast that stretches all the way to London, to Frankfurt, to Basel, Switzerland, and to Moscow.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:07.921]  Yeah, let's make that clear.
[01:40:07.961 --> 01:40:10.224]  This whole fight between the EU and the U.S.
[01:40:10.284 --> 01:40:11.125]  is totally staged.
[01:40:11.445 --> 01:40:13.728]  The shareholders own all our central banks.
[01:40:14.028 --> 01:40:19.194]  They're having America play the part of the bad cop right now while legitimizing the bloodthirsty U.N.
[01:40:19.214 --> 01:40:22.939]  of the third world as the peacenik, when that couldn't be further from the truth.
[01:40:23.719 --> 01:40:26.563]  And it's all one giant amalgamation.
[01:40:27.702 --> 01:40:30.885]  Now there's been a lot of news of government-sponsored terrorism coming out.
[01:40:30.965 --> 01:40:34.549]  I've got the London Guardian and the Belfast Telegraph today.
[01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:37.652]  Top double agent in IRA guilty of up to 40 murders.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:51.884]  And it turns out the head of the IRA's intelligence and terror arm was a British agent, and that he carried the terror out for the British government as a pretext to have a militarized Northern Ireland.
[01:40:52.404 --> 01:40:54.505]  Now, we saw Putin blow up the apartment buildings.
[01:40:54.525 --> 01:40:55.505]  That's now admitted fact.
[01:40:55.545 --> 01:40:58.046]  We see what's happened with these other terror attacks.
[01:40:58.546 --> 01:41:03.527]  How important is government-sponsored terror to the globalists to get control of our lives?
[01:41:04.027 --> 01:41:06.108]  Well, it's one of the oldest tricks in the world, you know?
[01:41:07.121 --> 01:41:20.370]  I think this thing goes all the way back into biblical times, because if you look at the Reichstag fire, it was a means to get the German people behind Hitler, and Hitler to take over and subdue the Communists.
[01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:21.891]  He blamed the whole thing on the Communist Party.
[01:41:22.371 --> 01:41:31.677]  And then, of course, they staged a bogus Polish army attack on a German radio station across the border into Germany so that they could attack Poland.
[01:41:32.268 --> 01:41:34.671]  Blame it on the bad guys.
[01:41:34.791 --> 01:41:37.273]  Use the media to gain control of the minds of the people.
[01:41:37.614 --> 01:41:39.155]  They did the same thing in Oklahoma City.
[01:41:40.717 --> 01:41:51.928]  We definitely linked McVeigh and Nichols into these Iraqi Republican guards, down to the names of them, down to enough to arrest them and probably convict them,
[01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:54.747]  But the government didn't even want to take the information.
[01:41:54.787 --> 01:42:02.030]  That's because, and in the new film we have the LA Times and the Washington Post from 93, Congress says bringing in Iraqis dangerous.
[01:42:02.451 --> 01:42:04.512]  These guys were brought in by Bush and Clinton.
[01:42:04.792 --> 01:42:07.913]  They worked for the CIA and had ties back to the 70s and 80s.
[01:42:08.193 --> 01:42:09.214]  They didn't work for Saddam.
[01:42:09.774 --> 01:42:19.578]  Well, they worked for whoever gave them orders, and whoever gave them orders wanted a building in the heartland of America to go down for several reasons, and one of them was to help pass the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1996, which was...
[01:42:21.095 --> 01:42:22.536]  We're good to go.
[01:42:41.651 --> 01:42:43.973]  It doesn't matter what kind, and have rifles.
[01:42:44.634 --> 01:42:51.520]  You haven't heard in Minnesota and Illinois and places, they're actually raiding deer hunters now and arresting them, saying they're engaged in paramilitary.
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:52.701]  Well, that's what this was.
[01:42:52.741 --> 01:42:55.423]  This would designate them as terrorists undergoing terrorist training.
[01:42:56.051 --> 01:43:01.593]  And also the deal of hiring Hong Kong police officers to serve as national police in the United States.
[01:43:01.713 --> 01:43:08.736]  Oh, yeah, and now they've signed the deal for Canadian and Mexican troops to come in during terror attacks and during top-off, too.
[01:43:08.796 --> 01:43:11.036]  They admit Canadian troops on our soil.
[01:43:11.136 --> 01:43:12.497]  Is that a concern to you?
[01:43:12.837 --> 01:43:13.478]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:43:13.518 --> 01:43:18.822]  Anytime you've got any foreigner on our soil trying to do anything to enforce any kind of laws in this country, it should be a great concern.
[01:43:18.842 --> 01:43:21.163]  I mean, the military involvement in law enforcement is bad enough.
[01:43:21.524 --> 01:43:23.885]  They just said they want to get rid of posse commentatus.
[01:43:24.426 --> 01:43:26.527]  Why is that the hallmark of a police state?
[01:43:27.328 --> 01:43:36.695]  Well, you know, that's the one thing that we put in after the Civil War because of things that the Union Army did in the South, to keep the military separate from civil law enforcement.
[01:43:37.168 --> 01:43:39.749]  Because, number one, the military gets heavy-handed.
[01:43:39.929 --> 01:43:43.291]  The military is designed to go places, break things, ruin real estate, and kill people.
[01:43:43.811 --> 01:43:46.292]  It is not designed to go in and deal with communities.
[01:43:46.372 --> 01:43:56.436]  Because of that, you don't want power shifted to the military branch and put it in the hands of generals and so on, because you end up with, exactly as you said, a police state, which we did have.
[01:43:58.037 --> 01:44:05.560]  I had family raped and killed in East Texas.
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:11.483]  We have tombstones at family cemeteries that say killed by Union soldiers, women, children.
[01:44:12.643 --> 01:44:14.424]  And that's what happens when the military gets out of hand.
[01:44:14.504 --> 01:44:16.985]  Our hotel in Teague, Texas was burned to the ground.
[01:44:18.048 --> 01:44:21.269]  And so what they did is they put the shackles on that with Posse Comiconis.
[01:44:21.289 --> 01:44:26.031]  The problem was they wrote it only for the Army because that's all they were worried about at the time.
[01:44:26.211 --> 01:44:27.772]  Now they can use Marines and others.
[01:44:28.412 --> 01:44:29.953]  But they found out they could use Marines.
[01:44:29.973 --> 01:44:31.493]  They found out they could use naval personnel.
[01:44:31.533 --> 01:44:32.113]  And guess what?
[01:44:32.193 --> 01:44:38.756]  In 1947, when they separated the Air Force off of the Army, they could use Air Force personnel and they don't violate Posse Comiconis.
[01:44:39.611 --> 01:44:42.053]  So they found a way to do an end run around it.
[01:44:42.633 --> 01:44:48.218]  Absolutely, and I've had the former JAG officer on who's now a professor in Chicago, and he said in 96 it was already gone.
[01:44:48.858 --> 01:44:52.021]  They're now just letting us know it's gone using the terror as an excuse.
[01:44:52.421 --> 01:44:56.404]  Colonel Roberts, I want to talk about this headline here about how America is now a global empire.
[01:44:56.424 --> 01:44:59.607]  Talk about any key issues you want to discuss and take calls.
[01:44:59.627 --> 01:45:01.028]  So please stay with us.
[01:45:01.248 --> 01:45:02.089]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:45:04.136 --> 01:45:07.617]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:45:07.877 --> 01:45:11.379]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:45:11.479 --> 01:45:15.420]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:21.802]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:45:22.202 --> 01:45:30.125]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:45:30.545 --> 01:45:35.870]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:39.793]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:45:40.173 --> 01:45:42.035]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:45:42.095 --> 01:45:44.257]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:45:44.497 --> 01:45:49.741]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:45:49.781 --> 01:45:55.226]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:45:58.408 --> 01:46:00.469]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:46:00.549 --> 01:46:02.270]  Protect your family.
[01:46:04.050 --> 01:46:10.293]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[01:47:02.805 --> 01:47:10.171]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:47:10.451 --> 01:47:15.195]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:47:15.415 --> 01:47:21.060]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:21.420]  I think?
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:40.442]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:47:40.662 --> 01:47:47.407]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:47:47.607 --> 01:47:52.871]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:47:52.891 --> 01:47:53.291]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:48:08.735 --> 01:48:10.698]  Welcome back.
[01:48:11.359 --> 01:48:13.481]  We're moving fast.
[01:48:13.802 --> 01:48:19.329]  We've got Greg into the next hour.
[01:48:19.629 --> 01:48:22.513]  We're going to take your calls.
[01:48:28.266 --> 01:48:33.170]  Folks, you don't want to live under this New World Order, and they've got us all debating Bill Clinton, Al Gore, George Bush.
[01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:34.652]  They're not running anything, folks.
[01:48:35.172 --> 01:48:36.773]  They're puppets, bottom line.
[01:48:37.314 --> 01:48:39.716]  The New World Order agrees on the same agenda.
[01:48:39.756 --> 01:48:45.161]  When it comes down to the bottom line, that's enslavement of you and your family, and we'd better cause a real debate in this country.
[01:48:45.201 --> 01:48:45.541]  It's over.
[01:48:46.101 --> 01:48:47.943]  Colonel Roberts, how do we stop this thing?
[01:48:47.963 --> 01:48:51.246]  I mean, it's clear that we stopped their forced inoculation of 11 million people.
[01:48:51.926 --> 01:48:54.589]  The cops, the firemen, the medical workers said, no way, Jose.
[01:48:55.538 --> 01:48:56.278]  That's holding them up.
[01:48:56.298 --> 01:49:00.221]  They didn't get the Kissinger appointment over the Whitewash Commission on 9-1-1.
[01:49:00.501 --> 01:49:04.663]  They're not getting a lot of things they want through education or having victories.
[01:49:04.723 --> 01:49:09.866]  If we weren't doing this and they had the New World Order in 1913, how do we stop the New World Order?
[01:49:10.627 --> 01:49:12.788]  Because the point is they won't leave us alone.
[01:49:13.528 --> 01:49:17.230]  They're taking our liberty while claiming they're giving Iraqis liberty.
[01:49:17.290 --> 01:49:18.391]  How do we stop this thing?
[01:49:18.691 --> 01:49:22.413]  Well, they've pretty much won the entire rest of the world.
[01:49:22.473 --> 01:49:23.694]  We are the last dominoes.
[01:49:24.344 --> 01:49:28.926]  And the one thing we cannot do right up front, number one, is give up our Second Amendment rights.
[01:49:28.946 --> 01:49:34.509]  If we do that, if we allow that to occur, then it's a done deal.
[01:49:34.529 --> 01:49:34.989]  We've lost.
[01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:49.837]  Number two, we have to educate ourselves and each other and do our homework and keep up with what's going on and read between the lines of the news and so on and have guys like you and me running around waving the flag and telling everybody what's really going on and explaining it to them and translating what's going on.
[01:49:50.225 --> 01:49:54.367]  And number three, and probably as important as the other two, is take over our school systems again.
[01:49:54.407 --> 01:49:58.870]  Put them back into local control with monitoring from the parents and get them out of the state-controlled hands.
[01:49:59.410 --> 01:50:01.971]  Because if they win the minds of the children, they win.
[01:50:02.251 --> 01:50:03.832]  Because we'll be gone someday.
[01:50:03.972 --> 01:50:12.637]  As an example, I just got back from Pasadena, and I spoke at the Southern California Republican Convention Association or something like that.
[01:50:13.237 --> 01:50:15.378]  And they expected about 200 people to show up.
[01:50:15.418 --> 01:50:16.319]  We had about 70 show up.
[01:50:17.552 --> 01:50:21.574]  For an all-day deal, I was there, General Parton was there, some other people, some other speakers were there as well.
[01:50:22.294 --> 01:50:23.375]  We spoke for a little over an hour.
[01:50:24.055 --> 01:50:27.997]  And I looked out in that room, and there wasn't anybody below the age of 60 in the room.
[01:50:28.577 --> 01:50:29.778]  I think I was the youngest guy there at 56.
[01:50:30.678 --> 01:50:38.462]  Well, we have meetings here in Austin, and over half the folks are below 30, so we have thousands that show up and hundreds to any meeting we set.
[01:50:38.542 --> 01:50:40.703]  So we need more young leaders.
[01:50:41.023 --> 01:50:42.003]  Here's an example, L.A.
[01:50:42.043 --> 01:50:43.204]  Times, many school techs,
[01:50:43.584 --> 01:50:45.845]  Distort history, slamming the U.S.
[01:50:45.885 --> 01:50:47.385]  and glorifying despotic regimes.
[01:50:47.885 --> 01:50:50.146]  I have one they use in Texas, a world history book.
[01:50:50.466 --> 01:50:53.947]  It says, Mao was good, helped the people, the Second Amendment is bad.
[01:50:54.207 --> 01:50:55.727]  Actually says that.
[01:50:56.207 --> 01:51:06.190]  And Josh Sugarman of Handgun Control Incorporated, from the Violence Policy Center, says in our local paper, he said, we're going to get your guns, we've got your kids, so they know what they're doing, don't they?
[01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:10.591]  Oh, they're trying real hard, and they're trying to convince us they've already won, and it's hopeless to fight against them.
[01:51:10.611 --> 01:51:11.251]  But the thing is,
[01:51:12.419 --> 01:51:23.027]  They haven't won anything yet, as long as we can do several things right now, and that is get back in control of the situation by getting in control of our own school systems, getting control of our own state legislatures.
[01:51:23.067 --> 01:51:24.788]  We've got to start at the local level first.
[01:51:25.009 --> 01:51:25.409]  Absolutely.
[01:51:25.429 --> 01:51:26.410]  Listen to this headline.
[01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:29.592]  The American Empire, like it or not, it's reality.
[01:51:29.672 --> 01:51:30.193]  Embrace it.
[01:51:30.233 --> 01:51:31.033]  Get used to it.
[01:51:31.074 --> 01:51:32.014]  Chicago Tribune.
[01:51:33.195 --> 01:51:35.117]  Well, I've got bad news for those guys.
[01:51:35.177 --> 01:51:40.221]  It may be that way in downtown Chicago, but it's not that way in downtown Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas, so...
[01:51:41.165 --> 01:51:45.410]  You know, the majority of America right now, a lot of them are waking up.
[01:51:45.670 --> 01:51:47.893]  We're out here where we don't have a microphone to talk to.
[01:51:47.913 --> 01:51:51.717]  We're out here where we don't have a TV camera to broadcast to everybody, but we're still out here.
[01:51:51.897 --> 01:51:54.900]  So the thing about it is the Army is huge.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.425]  It's out here, but what we've got to do is we've got to start putting into motion
[01:52:00.763 --> 01:52:02.784]  A sequence of events to take the country back.
[01:52:02.944 --> 01:52:05.205]  We've also got to get focused on real issues.
[01:52:05.225 --> 01:52:08.626]  You know, on my show, in your presentations, we talk about real things.
[01:52:08.966 --> 01:52:16.188]  So many of the so-called patriots are off in la-la land with visions and flying saucers, and that's also hurting us.
[01:52:16.589 --> 01:52:19.289]  Well, and all of that is diversifying the forces.
[01:52:19.349 --> 01:52:21.270]  That takes away from the main thrust of the thing.
[01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:29.393]  That's like just... We investigated the Oklahoma City bombing case, and all of a sudden we had all these different media guys launching us off into different directions to...
[01:52:29.991 --> 01:52:31.092]  Investigate the militias.
[01:52:31.172 --> 01:52:32.173]  Investigate the right ones.
[01:52:32.273 --> 01:52:33.515]  Investigate Pat Robertson.
[01:52:33.595 --> 01:52:35.657]  Investigate Elohim City.
[01:52:35.917 --> 01:52:39.822]  And when you start splitting your forces up, you dilute the progress of the actual mission at hand.
[01:52:40.142 --> 01:52:40.542]  All right.
[01:52:40.643 --> 01:52:41.083]  Stay there.
[01:52:41.143 --> 01:52:41.924]  Calls coming up.
[01:52:41.944 --> 01:52:44.327]  A bunch of other news items we haven't hit on yet.
[01:52:44.347 --> 01:52:45.508]  We'll get Colonel Roberts' take.
[01:52:45.948 --> 01:52:46.789]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:52:47.170 --> 01:52:48.311]  Infowars.net.
[01:52:48.391 --> 01:52:49.432]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:52:49.672 --> 01:52:50.653]  We'll be back with your calls.
[01:52:50.693 --> 01:52:51.094]  Stay with me.
[01:52:54.216 --> 01:52:54.957]  Are you prepared?
[01:52:55.137 --> 01:52:57.541]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[01:52:57.761 --> 01:53:02.187]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[01:53:02.487 --> 01:53:11.279]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our ability... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.851 --> 01:53:20.491]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.152 --> 01:53:22.193]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.913 --> 01:53:24.034]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.695 --> 01:53:25.496]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.256 --> 01:53:27.177]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.838 --> 01:53:31.501]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.001 --> 01:53:36.125]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:38.227 --> 01:53:41.290]  Governments always get corrupt individuals in control of them.
[01:53:42.037 --> 01:53:42.718]  We're good to go.
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:59.683]  Best-selling author, Marine Corps sniper, Army intelligence colonel, police officer.
[01:53:59.703 --> 01:54:00.884]  The list goes on and on.
[01:54:01.284 --> 01:54:04.366]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:54:04.386 --> 01:54:06.288]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:07.028 --> 01:54:08.369]  Operation Top-Off, Colonel.
[01:54:08.409 --> 01:54:09.370]  You saw the road to tyranny.
[01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:12.232]  You saw the fake nuclear spills, the fake bio-attacks here in Austin.
[01:54:12.752 --> 01:54:18.577]  It's come out that the White House, under Clinton and Bush, ordered fake terror alerts to, quote, create hysteria.
[01:54:19.286 --> 01:54:19.987]  We're good to go.
[01:54:27.708 --> 01:54:34.733]  Now officials prepare for a bioterrorism drill taking place from Chicago to Seattle right now with fake dirty bombs and stuff.
[01:54:34.793 --> 01:54:41.218]  And locally, they announced this nationally, locally, they're saying it's real and hours later after terrorizing saying it was a drill.
[01:54:41.879 --> 01:54:43.540]  How important are these drills?
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:51.146]  How does it tie into the EAS system known as Amber Alert, really a FEMA takeover system in all radio and television stations?
[01:54:51.486 --> 01:54:54.268]  What do we see forming now under FEMA and Homeland Security?
[01:54:54.955 --> 01:55:03.819]  Well, I think what they've done, basically, is create a secondary form of government that physically takes over at the push of a button.
[01:55:04.499 --> 01:55:13.403]  And it circumvents the Constitution, circumvents all the laws, and they do whatever they want to do, and they declare it as necessary for your own protection under national emergency.
[01:55:13.483 --> 01:55:15.864]  And now they're practicing the activation of this.
[01:55:16.144 --> 01:55:18.165]  Well, and they have been for a long time.
[01:55:18.525 --> 01:55:24.328]  They've had several different types of drills, but what they're doing is they're bringing it together into regional and national exercises.
[01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:28.073]  To work the bugs out and find out what really works and to get us used to seeing it.
[01:55:28.254 --> 01:55:30.036]  I think that's the most important thing.
[01:55:30.076 --> 01:55:32.100]  So they're war gaming for the takeover.
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:39.431]  Yeah, and at the same time, you've got to prepare the public to accept something as being something that's planned and it's for your own good and it's normal.
[01:55:39.847 --> 01:55:51.232]  You know, when you read the little bits and pieces and are able to put them together, and that's what I used to do in tactical intelligence, was try to take the bits and pieces of the reconnaissance reports and satellite photos and all that and put it together and try to figure out what the bad guys wrote.
[01:55:51.252 --> 01:55:52.533]  It's not bits and pieces now.
[01:55:52.573 --> 01:55:53.493]  It's right out in the open.
[01:55:54.013 --> 01:55:56.574]  Well, it is, except it's not, because they don't make a big deal.
[01:55:56.614 --> 01:55:57.755]  You only see it for 30 seconds.
[01:55:57.815 --> 01:56:00.556]  Oh, yeah, they calmly report it like it's no big deal, yeah.
[01:56:00.656 --> 01:56:04.598]  It's just like, you know, having a toothache or a pothole, and by the way, we rounded up 1,000 people today.
[01:56:05.857 --> 01:56:11.559]  It just passes in one ear and out the other, and it's mind-numbing because people see this and they go on, but they're not thinking about it.
[01:56:11.599 --> 01:56:13.820]  It's almost subliminal.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.580]  It is, except it's more out in the open.
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:16.060]  It's right there.
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:19.041]  They said, well, it was on the news, and no one seemed to mind.
[01:56:19.761 --> 01:56:30.165]  When FEMA goes out and issues contracts to buy up hundreds of thousands of acres out here for relocation centers in case they have to evacuate the cities, and no one says a peep.
[01:56:30.405 --> 01:56:34.706]  And then the Rocky Mountain News says they've got incinerators and mass graves ready.
[01:56:35.365 --> 01:56:38.227]  Well, yes, you've got to be able to handle all those infected corpses, Alex.
[01:56:38.387 --> 01:56:38.828]  Don't you know?
[01:56:38.848 --> 01:56:41.650]  The problem is, who created the infections?
[01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:43.451]  And are they really infected?
[01:56:43.471 --> 01:56:44.231]  Well, take England.
[01:56:44.271 --> 01:56:49.015]  It came out, the government released foot and mouth months before, got the counties ready.
[01:56:49.847 --> 01:56:54.170]  It turns out the British have carried out almost every bombing in the last 24 years to blame on their enemies.
[01:56:54.451 --> 01:56:55.231]  The Russians do it.
[01:56:55.371 --> 01:56:56.172]  Our government does it.
[01:56:57.013 --> 01:57:03.297]  So I guess the number one thrust is educating folks of who has the motive for the terror and then showing them the evidence of who carried out the terror?
[01:57:03.938 --> 01:57:10.403]  Well, you know, you can take every bit of this and you can compare it to one prime example, and that was the Kennedy assassination.
[01:57:11.004 --> 01:57:11.304]  I think so.
[01:57:25.871 --> 01:57:28.713]  So therefore, he is a communist, and the communists killed Kennedy.
[01:57:28.753 --> 01:57:30.194]  In fact, it was probably hooked to Castro.
[01:57:30.214 --> 01:57:31.835]  In fact, we ought to go back and invade Cuba.
[01:57:32.495 --> 01:57:40.240]  So you see, what they do is they set the dominoes up well in advance, they war game it out, and then when they're ready to really push the dominoes over, it's a done deal.
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:42.121]  The media jumps in immediately and says...
[01:57:42.737 --> 01:57:43.678]  This is what happened.
[01:57:43.718 --> 01:57:46.020]  And everybody goes, ooh, yeah, this is what happened.
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:46.840]  What can we do about it?
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:47.461]  Well, there's two things.
[01:57:47.501 --> 01:57:51.124]  We'll protect you, number one, and we've got to go attack somebody or arrest somebody, number two.
[01:57:51.544 --> 01:57:53.365]  And that's exactly what Northwoods called for.
[01:57:53.385 --> 01:57:55.627]  We'll talk about Operation Northwoods and Colonel Roberts.
[01:57:56.048 --> 01:58:01.432]  We'll talk about how they pushed the big domino over with 9-1-1, but that was just the firing pin hitting the cap.
[01:58:01.852 --> 01:58:05.235]  Now the bullets left the barrel.
[01:58:05.375 --> 01:58:06.276]  And where is it going?
[01:58:06.296 --> 01:58:06.956]  What's going to happen?
[01:58:06.976 --> 01:58:07.897]  What are we going to see next?
[01:58:08.497 --> 01:58:13.459]  And your calls, Lou and others that are holding 800-259-9231.
[01:58:17.181 --> 01:58:20.803]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.

[01:58:33.348 --> 01:58:34.109]  We're good to go.
[01:58:54.671 --> 01:58:57.592]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[01:58:57.772 --> 01:58:59.592]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.

[01:59:18.977 --> 01:59:20.257]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:31.741]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:59:32.022 --> 01:59:36.143]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:59:36.323 --> 01:59:40.148]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:59:40.408 --> 01:59:45.034]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:59:45.134 --> 01:59:51.402]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:59:51.442 --> 01:59:53.204]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:00:11.481 --> 02:00:13.523]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:00:16.141 --> 02:00:24.310]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:00:24.511 --> 02:00:28.976]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[02:00:28.996 --> 02:00:32.139]  There are no moving parts, and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:36.965]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[02:00:37.305 --> 02:00:41.188]  Made of the finest materials, it has a two-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[02:00:41.448 --> 02:00:43.830]  And the Aaronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[02:00:44.130 --> 02:00:48.013]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[02:00:48.233 --> 02:00:53.437]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds, and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[02:00:53.657 --> 02:00:56.579]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[02:00:56.739 --> 02:00:58.620]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[02:00:58.841 --> 02:01:01.483]  For more information about the Aaronizer, call Toll Free.
[02:01:01.743 --> 02:01:03.484]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[02:01:03.664 --> 02:01:07.207]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[02:01:07.247 --> 02:01:10.269]  That's 877-605-9200.
[02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:20.096]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:20.296 --> 02:01:22.778]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:26.821 --> 02:01:30.184]  We go out on a growing list of wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[02:01:31.337 --> 02:01:34.440]  We stumblecast at infowars.com and net.
[02:01:35.901 --> 02:01:37.823]  Global shortwave from 11 a.m.
[02:01:37.863 --> 02:01:38.623]  until 2 p.m.
[02:01:39.064 --> 02:01:45.689]  Central Standard Time at 12.172 and 93.20 at night from 9 to midnight Central at 5.085 and 68.90.
[02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:48.712]  We're joined by Colonel Craig Roberts.
[02:01:48.732 --> 02:01:53.356]  We're about to go to Lou, Frank, Doug, and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:01:54.157 --> 02:01:58.861]  If 911 was the activation, not the summation...
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:13.123]  Of an acceleration of tyranny and enslavement and New World Order control and mobilizing us to be the surf enforcers for the New World Order, what do we see happening down the road?
[02:02:13.163 --> 02:02:18.564]  They've told us a living nightmare of endless terror attacks, endless arrests, endless enslavement.
[02:02:18.964 --> 02:02:22.905]  They've already demonized and created this idea of all these right-wing terror groups that will have to be dealt with.
[02:02:23.365 --> 02:02:24.685]  They're going after our guns.
[02:02:24.705 --> 02:02:25.886]  They're getting rid of our borders.
[02:02:26.286 --> 02:02:27.946]  They're setting up this system.
[02:02:28.743 --> 02:02:31.926]  What do you see happening next, Roberts, and how will this go?
[02:02:32.006 --> 02:02:32.746]  How will this develop?
[02:02:34.488 --> 02:02:44.916]  They've still got a few cards to play, and one of them, you know, you have to use terrorism to gain the fear and the obedience of the people.
[02:02:45.436 --> 02:02:57.326]  And they've hit all five of the standard terrorist targets, the private building, the public building, mass transportation ground, mass transportation air, and a large gathering of people, that being the 9-11 attack on the last part.
[02:02:58.430 --> 02:03:02.071]  But they can go back and start hitting those again in different parts of the country.
[02:03:02.652 --> 02:03:07.013]  The thing is they've been preparing us and preparing us for two more hits that we haven't seen yet.
[02:03:07.193 --> 02:03:09.754]  One is biological and the other is chemical.
[02:03:10.054 --> 02:03:11.995]  And under chemical we can throw in nuclear too.
[02:03:12.035 --> 02:03:14.236]  We can talk about backpack nukes and all that sort of thing.
[02:03:14.656 --> 02:03:19.397]  But I think the biggest threat we have to worry about right now is biological because chemical is not long term.
[02:03:19.437 --> 02:03:21.198]  It's hard to predict.
[02:03:21.258 --> 02:03:23.859]  It's hard to control and it doesn't have that much shock effect.
[02:03:24.338 --> 02:03:24.838]  I think so.
[02:03:45.330 --> 02:03:48.513]  You gain total control of movement, thought, everything.
[02:03:48.773 --> 02:03:50.795]  Because you can tell the people, don't leave home.
[02:03:50.875 --> 02:03:51.675]  Don't go anyplace.
[02:03:51.695 --> 02:03:53.477]  We're going to put up roadblocks and checkpoints.
[02:03:53.737 --> 02:03:57.180]  And if we catch you out, we're going to have to put you into quarantine.
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:02.904]  Did you read the Gazette News Service report where the FEMA guy in New Jersey said, under a red alert, you're an enemy of the state.
[02:04:03.345 --> 02:04:04.385]  You can't leave your house.
[02:04:04.406 --> 02:04:06.007]  We're going to take your kids from the schools.
[02:04:06.367 --> 02:04:09.169]  The FEMA centers, they said that.
[02:04:09.289 --> 02:04:12.192]  That is textbook maximum martial law.
[02:04:13.594 --> 02:04:17.677]  It doesn't surprise me that there are people out there, not only that say it, but are willing to do it.
[02:04:18.098 --> 02:04:21.160]  And that's the frightening part, because it makes you wonder who they're really working for.
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:29.788]  Yeah, biological is perfect for shutting down studies, locking everything down, tightening the tyranny, and then it will never really pull back from that point.
[02:04:30.268 --> 02:04:34.772]  Well, once, you know, the federal government, not only here, but in every other government as well,
[02:04:35.311 --> 02:04:38.813]  Once it gains power in a certain area, it never, ever relinquishes it.
[02:04:38.893 --> 02:04:40.694]  And they've told us this is a new way of life.
[02:04:41.114 --> 02:04:42.054]  Everything changed.
[02:04:42.114 --> 02:04:42.875]  Get used to it.
[02:04:42.895 --> 02:04:44.956]  They were saying that within hours of 911.
[02:04:46.241 --> 02:04:52.284]  Oh, yeah, and once they put laws into effect, they can say, well, this law is going to sunset at a certain time.
[02:04:52.604 --> 02:04:53.825]  Well, a Brady law sunsetted.
[02:04:53.885 --> 02:04:54.565]  It didn't go away.
[02:04:54.585 --> 02:04:57.667]  The Assault Weapons Ban sunsetted.
[02:04:57.707 --> 02:05:01.569]  Patriot Act 1 sunsetted, but now they're saying they're going to get rid of that sunset.
[02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:11.574]  Yeah, well, they ignore their own boundaries, and once you start a law or a bureaucracy or an administration or a department, it empire builds on itself.
[02:05:11.594 --> 02:05:14.055]  Talk about Operation Northwoods, and let's go to some calls.
[02:05:14.904 --> 02:05:20.812]  Well, I really don't know that much about Northwoods other than what you've said, other than the fact that it was typical at that time.
[02:05:20.832 --> 02:05:28.703]  But I think another part of what may have occurred at that particular time as well was a sub-plan on Operation Mandarin.
[02:05:29.227 --> 02:05:46.744]  And you may not have heard about that, but that's what I call it anyway, because that was the assassination of John F. Kennedy, where Oswald was programmed to go to the Texas Theater, be picked up in a car out back and taken to Redbird Field, where a plane was waiting for him, flown by an anti-Castro Cuban pilot named Novo.
[02:05:47.544 --> 02:05:48.265]  The engine was running.
[02:05:48.285 --> 02:05:49.126]  This was all documented.
[02:05:49.446 --> 02:05:51.168]  And he was going to fly him down to Houston.
[02:05:51.836 --> 02:05:58.898]  Where he was going to be transferred over to David Ferry, who was waiting for a phone call, had a 20-inch airplane ready to go to fly him down to Oaxaca, Mexico.
[02:05:59.298 --> 02:06:06.160]  Now, in Oaxaca, Mexico, they were probably going to take him out and put a bullet in his head and bury him in the desert, but they were going to swear up and down that he defected to Cuba.
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:13.522]  Now, once they did that, they could say the President of the United States was assassinated by a communist agent of Fidel Castro, so now we can invade Cuba.
[02:06:14.462 --> 02:06:18.043]  That is identical to some of the Northwoods Projects.
[02:06:18.464 --> 02:06:23.466]  To where you create the scenario, you tell the people what happened, then you go do what you want, and they say, go get them.
[02:06:24.506 --> 02:06:30.548]  Well, for those who don't know, on InfoWars.com, we have a link to the National Security Archives, Library of Congress.
[02:06:30.568 --> 02:06:33.889]  You can go read the declassified document, 15, 16 pages.
[02:06:34.369 --> 02:06:38.231]  ABC News and Baltimore Sun, where they say that the U.S.
[02:06:38.271 --> 02:06:41.652]  government was going to hijack jet airliners for the college students and kill them.
[02:06:42.505 --> 02:06:42.966]  The U.S.
[02:06:42.986 --> 02:06:44.306]  government was going to bomb D.C.
[02:06:44.346 --> 02:06:46.047]  and carry out sniper attacks in D.C.
[02:06:46.087 --> 02:06:48.169]  and even how to frame patsies on page 9.
[02:06:48.609 --> 02:06:52.151]  It called for attacking the Marines of Guantanamo with an army dressed up like Cubans.
[02:06:52.932 --> 02:06:54.613]  All of this is a pretext for war.
[02:06:55.353 --> 02:06:56.934]  Now, that plan went to Kennedy.
[02:06:56.994 --> 02:06:59.796]  He said no, and he was assassinated soon thereafter.
[02:07:02.299 --> 02:07:06.683]  Why did the thing with their little minion Oswald fall apart?
[02:07:06.723 --> 02:07:08.004]  He decided not to go to the airport?
[02:07:08.044 --> 02:07:08.725]  Got a bad feeling?
[02:07:08.865 --> 02:07:12.748]  No, he went to the Texas Theater before, but his ride hadn't showed up yet.
[02:07:12.868 --> 02:07:13.469]  It got delayed.
[02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:16.431]  And while he was inside, he made one mistake.
[02:07:16.471 --> 02:07:17.212]  He didn't buy a ticket.
[02:07:17.532 --> 02:07:22.356]  He had the money in his pocket, but he thought, well, I'm going to go in the front door and out the back door, and I'm gone.
[02:07:22.396 --> 02:07:23.577]  He's not going to stop and buy a ticket.
[02:07:23.617 --> 02:07:26.800]  Well, when he did that, the ticket taker obviously wasn't in on the deal.
[02:07:27.219 --> 02:07:27.739]  We're good to go.
[02:07:58.021 --> 02:08:01.384]  I think he figured out by then that he was the one that was going to be used for the throwdown.
[02:08:01.544 --> 02:08:19.637]  I also think that maybe there was a secondary deal where he knew he was going to go to Cuba, yeah, be blamed for it, and then he was going to defect to Cuba just like he did Russia, and then be another American James Bond trying to subvert Castro because he was tied into all of the Bay of Pigs guys.
[02:08:20.137 --> 02:08:25.881]  Once the CIA project gets going, it develops legs on its own, and who knows where it goes from there.
[02:08:26.366 --> 02:08:28.948]  You get too many players in the deal, and they all want to do their own thing.
[02:08:29.328 --> 02:08:36.493]  But I think the whole thing at that point was to be able to divert the attention away from getting rid of Kennedy for several reasons.
[02:08:36.573 --> 02:08:39.475]  And then he was assassinated by their boy, Ruby.
[02:08:39.956 --> 02:08:47.721]  Yeah, but there's a lot of people who don't realize one of the reasons Kennedy was assassinated, of course, was the Federal Reserve, where he wanted to do away with that.
[02:08:47.741 --> 02:08:48.381]  That was the big one.
[02:08:48.582 --> 02:08:51.043]  But there was another one that really irritated the CIA.
[02:08:51.083 --> 02:08:54.826]  Besides telling the CIA he was going to cut it up and throw it a thousand different directions to the winds,
[02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:59.334]  You're talking 80 tons of pure heroin a year coming out of that place back in the 1960s, which went up to 800 tons by 1989, by the way.
[02:09:17.186 --> 02:09:26.775]  It took them 30 years to get those concessions in the Golden Triangle, and they had transferred all the Bay of Pigs players to Vintian Layoffs.
[02:09:26.815 --> 02:09:32.481]  They had Shackley and Clines over there, all the big players in the Bay of Pigs bunch down at JM Wave in Miami.
[02:09:32.501 --> 02:09:34.362]  They had transferred all those guys to Vintian Layoffs.
[02:09:36.003 --> 02:09:37.924]  Well, now look at Afghanistan.
[02:09:38.084 --> 02:09:41.245]  Record opium production for your children to inject.
[02:09:41.586 --> 02:09:43.306]  Let's talk to Lou in Colorado.
[02:09:43.366 --> 02:09:44.187]  Lou, you're on the air.
[02:09:44.227 --> 02:09:44.667]  Go ahead.
[02:09:44.687 --> 02:09:45.967]  Yeah, how you doing, Mr. Roberts?
[02:09:46.668 --> 02:09:48.228]  This is one guy that's not a youngster.
[02:09:48.368 --> 02:09:49.069]  I'm 60 years old.
[02:09:50.089 --> 02:09:54.571]  And one of the things I want to get from you first is your website.
[02:09:55.151 --> 02:09:57.352]  Riflewarrior.com What was that?
[02:09:57.372 --> 02:09:57.652]  Pardon me?
[02:09:58.292 --> 02:09:59.853]  Riflewarrior.com Riflewarrior.com
[02:10:02.995 --> 02:10:03.456]  Oh, rifle.
[02:10:03.856 --> 02:10:06.278]  Yeah, a warrior sniper carries a rifle.
[02:10:06.879 --> 02:10:07.940]  Yeah, okay.
[02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:08.721]  Say it again, then.
[02:10:09.461 --> 02:10:10.703]  Riflewarrior.com.
[02:10:10.803 --> 02:10:11.583]  That's what I said, isn't it?
[02:10:11.804 --> 02:10:11.964]  Right.
[02:10:12.284 --> 02:10:14.366]  I thought you said info, but I could be here.
[02:10:14.386 --> 02:10:15.687]  Okay, well, go ahead, sir.
[02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:21.373]  But anyhow, I want to tell you guys, too, if you ever come out to around the Denver area or something like that,
[02:10:22.146 --> 02:10:23.327]  Either one of you.
[02:10:23.567 --> 02:10:25.009]  You guys got a place to stay.
[02:10:25.289 --> 02:10:25.429]  Free.
[02:10:25.469 --> 02:10:26.430]  I appreciate that, sir.
[02:10:26.450 --> 02:10:27.130]  What's on your mind?
[02:10:27.491 --> 02:10:27.891]  Okay.
[02:10:27.971 --> 02:10:31.534]  The other thing is, I had an article a long time ago that somebody gave me.
[02:10:31.814 --> 02:10:36.678]  It was called Blueprint for Eternity, written by Donald Goldberg and Indy Bodwar.
[02:10:36.698 --> 02:10:44.284]  And it talked about how President Reagan could virtually suspend the Bill of Rights and call out troops in the name of public safety.
[02:10:44.304 --> 02:10:45.125]  Okay.
[02:10:45.816 --> 02:10:54.438]  And there was a part in this article that said, COG is a secretive shadow government known only to a handful of officials that is in place and ready to run the country.
[02:10:54.758 --> 02:10:55.658]  Are you familiar with that one?
[02:10:55.678 --> 02:10:56.538]  It's called Continuity of Government.
[02:10:56.558 --> 02:10:58.859]  Well, whatever name they give it, they announced it last year.
[02:10:58.939 --> 02:11:02.199]  We have the Washington Post admitting a shadow government now runs America.
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:07.041]  Well, COG is Continuity of Government, and that's the program that came in under Eisenhower and Truman and all that bunch.
[02:11:07.761 --> 02:11:08.101]  I see.
[02:11:08.641 --> 02:11:13.862]  And so this is all part of the same... Yeah, and they're the ones who built all the underground bases and shelters and stuff.
[02:11:15.129 --> 02:11:19.171]  You know, your name and my name's not on the list to go there if anything happens, but they've got places to go.
[02:11:19.231 --> 02:11:23.172]  And with all this national security anonymity and secrecy, they can do whatever they want.
[02:11:23.632 --> 02:11:23.892]  Right.
[02:11:24.112 --> 02:11:26.473]  And all of that COG stuff came right out of the report from Iron Mountain.
[02:11:27.673 --> 02:11:29.534]  It's out there if people just want to just do their homework.
[02:11:29.994 --> 02:11:30.234]  Right.
[02:11:30.714 --> 02:11:35.876]  Colonel Roberts, why would they announce early in 2002 that COG was in full control?
[02:11:35.896 --> 02:11:41.258]  I guess they have to when they're telling local officials that there's a new bill to federalize all the cities.
[02:11:42.037 --> 02:11:46.079]  And under that bill, they've already taken over New Orleans without even passing a law.
[02:11:46.099 --> 02:11:48.199]  I mean, they're publicly federalizing cities.
[02:11:48.219 --> 02:11:49.100]  Should that concern people?
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:50.140]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:51.081]  But you know how they did it?
[02:11:51.101 --> 02:11:51.861]  They did it with money.
[02:11:51.921 --> 02:12:02.605]  They got everybody on grant programs, and they federalized a lot of the operational aspects of the various city governments, and then they said, okay, now, Mr. Mayor, Mr. City Commissioners, and all you other guys, you now work for us.
[02:12:03.165 --> 02:12:05.326]  It's real easy to do if you've got a big enough checkbook.
[02:12:07.179 --> 02:12:08.179]  So it's now happening.
[02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:09.100]  Anything else, Lou?
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:09.940]  No, that's it.
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:10.701]  Thanks a lot, fellas.
[02:12:10.901 --> 02:12:11.281]  Good work.
[02:12:11.381 --> 02:12:12.081]  Thanks for the call.
[02:12:12.181 --> 02:12:13.682]  Frank in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[02:12:13.722 --> 02:12:14.182]  Go ahead.
[02:12:15.343 --> 02:12:16.663]  Yes, good afternoon.
[02:12:17.383 --> 02:12:24.006]  Colonel Roberts, when the invisible government blew up the building in Oklahoma City, I have two pictures.
[02:12:24.767 --> 02:12:32.010]  One was the picture of John Doe with the cap on, and the other picture I have was a young punk from Germany.
[02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:33.310]  I forgot his name.
[02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:34.511]  Stadmeier?
[02:12:34.531 --> 02:12:34.951]  Stadmeier.
[02:12:35.712 --> 02:12:37.013]  What was the deal with that?
[02:12:37.693 --> 02:12:39.994]  Well, Strassmeyer was an agent that was put here.
[02:12:41.554 --> 02:12:46.216]  He was on loan from the German Army, actually, and was brought over here to infiltrate the right-wing underground.
[02:12:46.896 --> 02:12:49.057]  He had a hard time doing that because there really wasn't one.
[02:12:49.077 --> 02:12:53.879]  He got as far as Ellicott City, and from there, he was used to help be a control agent for Nichols and McVeigh.
[02:12:56.219 --> 02:12:57.860]  Yeah, so they had lots of throwdowns.
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:03.122]  Iraqi throwdowns, Army throwdowns, German throwdowns, and went ahead and went with the McVeigh angle.
[02:13:04.378 --> 02:13:04.579]  Thanks.
[02:13:04.699 --> 02:13:05.540]  Anything else, Frank?
[02:13:06.261 --> 02:13:08.305]  Well, I just wanted to say... Well, just stay there, then.
[02:13:08.766 --> 02:13:10.288]  I'll come back to you after this quick break.
[02:13:10.809 --> 02:13:11.430]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:11.451 --> 02:13:12.032]  Stay with me, Hooks.
[02:13:15.629 --> 02:13:15.969]  We're good to go.
[02:13:38.507 --> 02:13:40.428]  But you've got to act fast by calling toll-free 1-800-686-2237.
[02:13:40.448 --> 02:13:40.728]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:07.662]  Coin values are always changing, and so is the Red Book Guide to U.S.
[02:14:07.722 --> 02:14:08.082]  Coins.

[02:14:10.384 --> 02:14:12.666]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:14:14.587 --> 02:14:17.369]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[02:14:17.569 --> 02:14:23.873]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[02:14:24.193 --> 02:14:30.077]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them, but still have them safe and sound?
[02:14:30.537 --> 02:14:34.240]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax exempt?
[02:14:34.975 --> 02:14:36.517]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[02:14:36.777 --> 02:14:37.638]  Well, there is a way.
[02:14:37.898 --> 02:14:43.984]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[02:14:44.384 --> 02:14:54.654]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[02:14:54.714 --> 02:14:55.495]  Constitution.
[02:14:55.775 --> 02:14:57.436]  You don't have to go offshore to do it, either.
[02:14:57.677 --> 02:14:59.979]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[02:15:00.439 --> 02:15:08.151]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the Internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:15:08.412 --> 02:15:12.858]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:15:14.562 --> 02:15:16.184]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:15:16.544 --> 02:15:22.290]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:27.676]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:15:28.016 --> 02:15:37.306]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:15:37.646 --> 02:15:42.590]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:15:42.930 --> 02:15:46.953]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:15:47.133 --> 02:15:51.937]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:15:52.277 --> 02:15:58.162]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[02:16:14.466 --> 02:16:20.813]  By now you've all heard about prostate wellness from OneSource Health Products, the natural product to help men maintain and improve their prostate health.
[02:16:21.053 --> 02:16:25.998]  Did you know each year over 400,000 men in the United States alone undergo prostate surgery?
[02:16:26.458 --> 02:16:29.441]  Odds are two to one you'll have prostate problems by the time you're 60 years of age.
[02:16:30.342 --> 02:16:31.142]  How do you fight back?
[02:16:31.442 --> 02:16:33.743]  With Prostate Wellness from OneSource Health Products.
[02:16:33.963 --> 02:16:35.403]  It's all natural and effective.
[02:16:35.603 --> 02:16:47.967]  High potency Prostate Wellness active ingredient beta-citosterol, commonly referred to as the Prostate Miracle, has been helping men with prostate and urinary problems such as frequent urination and difficult urination caused by the natural growth of the prostate.

[02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:58.470]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:16:58.590 --> 02:17:00.051]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:27.347 --> 02:17:30.069]  Colonel Roberts is going to stay with us for the rest of the show.
[02:17:30.089 --> 02:17:32.130]  We appreciate him taking the time out to do that.
[02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:37.313]  We'll tell you about some of the stuff we'll be discussing in Kansas City this Saturday when we both give a presentation there.
[02:17:38.314 --> 02:17:40.756]  But right now, let's go back to Frank, Louisiana.
[02:17:40.796 --> 02:17:41.976]  Frank, you had another point you wanted to make.
[02:17:42.016 --> 02:17:42.397]  Go ahead.
[02:17:44.698 --> 02:17:49.701]  When they didn't bring this guy Stoudemire back from Germany, that told me everything that they were just covering this whole thing up.
[02:17:50.822 --> 02:17:54.904]  Well, the police actually got him, but Clinton ordered his release.
[02:17:54.965 --> 02:17:55.565]  Correct, Colonel?
[02:17:57.762 --> 02:18:00.224]  Well, Strassmeyer, that was hands-off.
[02:18:00.284 --> 02:18:09.550]  They were told not to even pick him up, don't even talk to him, and they had orders come in from every place, from Oklahoma City Governor's Office to Fort Bragg to Washington to leave this guy alone.
[02:18:09.810 --> 02:18:16.074]  And the next thing we know, he disappears out of the country through Mexico and ends up back in Germany, and the guy that took him was Curt Lyons.
[02:18:16.573 --> 02:18:22.718]  Which shocked me because Curt Lyons was the lawyer that helped defend some of the Waco people and that sort of thing.
[02:18:22.738 --> 02:18:32.546]  Well, maybe he believed what Strassmeyer was saying, but the big deal here is that we have all these shadowy characters.
[02:18:33.547 --> 02:18:38.691]  Did they not throw down the Iraqi end of it because the operation was compromised?
[02:18:39.191 --> 02:18:42.354]  Well, the Iraqi end of it right there, if we arrested the Iraqis,
[02:18:42.836 --> 02:18:44.598]  Then we would have to find out who they worked for.
[02:18:44.618 --> 02:18:48.160]  And if we found out who they worked for, it might not go the direction that they wanted us to go to.
[02:18:48.561 --> 02:19:01.552]  Because we've got to remember on the incidents that happened on day one, the most important one was stopping all the rescue efforts within an hour of the explosion and pulling everybody out of the area and then going in and getting records out of the bottom of the building and then those records drive off and disappear.
[02:19:01.872 --> 02:19:04.194]  And then pulling unexploded bombs out as well.
[02:19:04.514 --> 02:19:05.494]  Well, they got those out as well.
[02:19:05.534 --> 02:19:11.396]  And, you know, Terrence Jakey's suicide, which was actually a homicide, we think is because he's one of the first officers in the scene.
[02:19:11.456 --> 02:19:16.978]  He saw the additional charges on the columns of the walls that hadn't gone off that were linked together with dead court.
[02:19:17.838 --> 02:19:25.180]  You know, there's so many things that they had to do damage control on immediately after this thing started that it was incredible.
[02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:30.042]  Now, the way that officer was killed, is that indicative of people inside the force or...
[02:19:31.107 --> 02:19:37.112]  No, this guy was killed by professional hitmen, probably professional assassins.
[02:19:37.152 --> 02:19:38.533]  He had been tortured.
[02:19:38.634 --> 02:19:39.735]  His wrists had been slashed.
[02:19:39.755 --> 02:19:50.484]  And I'll be, by the way, talking about all this, and I'm bringing the information and the medical examiner's documents and the pictures and everything with me to Kansas City for those that can show up on the Yakey case.
[02:19:50.564 --> 02:19:52.445]  Because Yakey was taken out into a field.
[02:19:52.485 --> 02:19:53.046]  He was beaten.
[02:19:53.653 --> 02:19:54.354]  He was tortured.
[02:19:54.895 --> 02:19:56.898]  His wrist and his elbows were slashed.
[02:19:57.859 --> 02:19:59.401]  Both jugular veins were slashed.
[02:19:59.441 --> 02:20:05.310]  And then he was shot down through the top of the right-hand side of his head down through his left cheek with a small caliber weapon with a silencer on it.
[02:20:05.350 --> 02:20:09.035]  We've got all the evidence of this, and yet we can't get the Oklahoma City Police Department's chief.
[02:20:09.528 --> 02:20:10.209]  We're good to go.
[02:20:10.289 --> 02:20:11.089]  We're good to go.
[02:20:31.821 --> 02:20:32.221]  I think so.
[02:20:50.718 --> 02:20:56.203]  You know, my ultimate deal is something I answer to God, and it's what I do here that counts, and I'm not going to be a coward about it.
[02:20:57.024 --> 02:21:02.409]  Well, I mean, if you go to Vietnam and get shot at for what you believe was your country, you're certainly going to fight for the homeland now.
[02:21:02.749 --> 02:21:07.854]  Oh, absolutely, but the thing about it is, our government isn't the United States government anymore.
[02:21:07.894 --> 02:21:12.157]  It's been taken over by criminals in there who are using it for their own personal agenda.
[02:21:12.177 --> 02:21:16.001]  They have to be identified, they have to be pointed out, and they have to be replaced.
[02:21:16.624 --> 02:21:17.386]  It's as simple as that.
[02:21:17.466 --> 02:21:20.431]  Well, that's the problem, is that people think by cowering they're safe.
[02:21:20.512 --> 02:21:22.435]  No, these globalists don't know how to stop.
[02:21:22.956 --> 02:21:28.407]  No, they want everybody to go into their little boxes and close the doors, and they'll deal with you at their own leisure.
[02:21:29.499 --> 02:21:36.382]  You know, somebody has to man the wall of the Alamo or the enemy's going to be inside the gate, you know, by dark.
[02:21:36.762 --> 02:21:37.562]  That's it, folks.
[02:21:37.963 --> 02:21:39.043]  It's our children's future.
[02:21:39.063 --> 02:21:40.784]  It takes men standing up.
[02:21:41.104 --> 02:21:41.464]  That's it.
[02:21:41.504 --> 02:21:42.885]  You know, I've had a good time.
[02:21:42.925 --> 02:21:43.845]  They can kill me tomorrow.
[02:21:43.865 --> 02:21:44.845]  It doesn't make any difference.
[02:21:44.865 --> 02:21:45.606]  I've had a good life.
[02:21:45.626 --> 02:21:47.707]  But my kids are going to have to live in this world.
[02:21:47.727 --> 02:21:48.427]  I don't want them to.
[02:21:48.847 --> 02:21:50.128]  I already know what's going on.
[02:21:50.208 --> 02:21:51.168]  I can see down the road.
[02:21:51.696 --> 02:21:54.597]  And I don't want them to have to deal with that, especially when they're not as equipped as we are.
[02:21:54.637 --> 02:21:57.078]  Well, I'm a lot younger than you are, but I've already made that decision.
[02:21:57.619 --> 02:22:00.180]  Standing up against pure evil is something we've got to do.
[02:22:00.780 --> 02:22:04.222]  And, you know, before I'm like, there's no way I can stop myself.
[02:22:04.242 --> 02:22:06.943]  There's no way I can quit what I'm doing, even though I know the cost.
[02:22:06.963 --> 02:22:10.824]  Because if we weren't here fighting, it would be much worse right now.
[02:22:11.365 --> 02:22:15.206]  Well, I tell people, look, everybody gets fearful.
[02:22:15.467 --> 02:22:18.188]  And they say, well, they're so big and there's so many of them.
[02:22:18.208 --> 02:22:18.748]  And I say, look.
[02:22:19.238 --> 02:22:31.622]  It only took a handful of Spartans at Thermopylae to hold back the whole Persian army and could have done it indefinitely had it not been for one spy that took the Persians around through the mountain passes behind them until they surrounded them.
[02:22:32.062 --> 02:22:35.904]  So it was treachery that did that, but still it just goes to show it.
[02:22:35.984 --> 02:22:39.545]  A small group of people can make a big difference if they're willing to stand up and fight against the bad.
[02:22:40.565 --> 02:22:45.287]  We're more than a small group, and the globalists only have a few thousand killers and...
[02:22:46.787 --> 02:22:48.709]  You know, they're doing this whole thing through ignorance.
[02:22:48.829 --> 02:22:50.129]  And that's why we have so much power.
[02:22:50.170 --> 02:22:51.771]  And our numbers are growing every day, Colonel.
[02:22:52.911 --> 02:22:53.892]  Our numbers are exploding.
[02:22:54.012 --> 02:22:55.573]  We'll come back and talk to Doug and others.
[02:22:56.234 --> 02:23:04.179]  And of course, take your calls at 1-800-259-9231 as we defend the republic against enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:06.621]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.061 --> 02:23:08.682]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.603 --> 02:23:12.305]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:19.622]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:23:19.802 --> 02:23:25.305]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:23:25.565 --> 02:23:28.187]  Ideal for track 4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:23:28.207 --> 02:23:29.887]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:23:29.907 --> 02:23:30.047]  Music
[02:23:47.453 --> 02:23:47.833]  I don't know.
[02:23:47.914 --> 02:23:49.814]  It's really instinctive for me.
[02:23:49.854 --> 02:23:55.716]  When I found out how truly evil the global star, how deep the rabbit hole went, I have been stunned.
[02:23:55.976 --> 02:24:02.058]  And I do get this cold chill up my backside when I face just how bad it is.
[02:24:02.930 --> 02:24:08.752]  Instinctively, I have no other choice but to expose the New World Order, what they really are and what they're doing.
[02:24:08.772 --> 02:24:14.534]  We cannot give in to this cashless society that can only be dubbed as an anti-Christ beast system.
[02:24:14.695 --> 02:24:15.195]  Literally.
[02:24:16.415 --> 02:24:29.480]  And the horrible things they do, what they put in the vaccines, what they put in the food, what they've been caught doing, what their own public plans are, how they give peace prizes to people like Coffee Ann who was involved in murdering 800,000 people.
[02:24:30.281 --> 02:24:31.441]  I mean, it's a sick joke.
[02:24:32.245 --> 02:24:36.627]  And we have the forces to educate the people of what's happening.
[02:24:36.647 --> 02:24:39.709]  But you've got to get involved in the fight, folks, and that makes us all safer.
[02:24:40.149 --> 02:24:41.010]  The more of us stand up.
[02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:44.071]  Before we go back to Colonel Roberts and all your calls, there's a lot of them I know.
[02:24:44.091 --> 02:24:46.573]  Herbal Healer Academy, folks.
[02:24:46.593 --> 02:24:49.634]  They've got pleasant, scented, water-based insect repellent.
[02:24:49.834 --> 02:24:50.715]  Very important.
[02:24:51.315 --> 02:24:53.296]  Natural pet and livestock products.
[02:24:53.356 --> 02:24:54.837]  Free catalogs and newsletters.
[02:24:55.257 --> 02:24:58.279]  Naturopathic correspondence programs that are excellent.
[02:24:59.319 --> 02:25:00.380]  Home study courses.
[02:25:01.168 --> 02:25:08.428]  MSM sulfur capsules, olive leaf capsules, vitamin C, natural detox formulas, all these books and great information.
[02:25:09.241 --> 02:25:10.882]  You need to give them a call.
[02:25:10.962 --> 02:25:22.090]  You need to go to HerbalHealer.com HerbalHealer.com or call 870-269-4177 and tell them Alex Jones sent you to get the free newsletter catalog.
[02:25:22.610 --> 02:25:25.011]  It's over a hundred page catalog and a huge monthly newsletter.
[02:25:25.031 --> 02:25:37.940]  870-269-4177 or HerbalHealer.com Colonel Roberts, when you found out about the New World Order writing your first Kennedy assassination book
[02:25:39.443 --> 02:25:41.645]  How did you acclimate to it?
[02:25:41.906 --> 02:25:45.490]  It's hard to face on the surface how evil they are.
[02:25:45.711 --> 02:25:46.692]  One case I keep using...
[02:25:47.794 --> 02:25:54.019]  Six months ago, it comes out all over the foreign press, even our press, DynCorp, quietly convicted in the civil court.
[02:25:54.559 --> 02:25:56.280]  A DynCorp employee and a brave U.N.
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:03.505]  employee quit and said they're loading 200,000 women and children on C-130s, on jets, flying them out around the world, the slave brothels.
[02:26:05.046 --> 02:26:06.507]  We're not going to be involved in this.
[02:26:06.587 --> 02:26:07.968]  And the two employees got fired.
[02:26:08.008 --> 02:26:08.509]  They sued.
[02:26:08.529 --> 02:26:09.309]  They both won.
[02:26:09.690 --> 02:26:10.750]  But DynCorp had a U.N.
[02:26:10.770 --> 02:26:11.751]  diplomatic immunity.
[02:26:12.211 --> 02:26:15.514]  You know, Stalin said you kill one person, it's a tragedy.
[02:26:15.534 --> 02:26:15.994]  10,000 is a statistic.
[02:26:17.950 --> 02:26:20.351]  I mean, here's 200,000 kidnapped women and children.
[02:26:20.391 --> 02:26:23.092]  Imagine the movies, the miniseries that can be made of that.
[02:26:23.672 --> 02:26:25.612]  But they're given the contracts in Afghanistan.
[02:26:25.632 --> 02:26:28.733]  They're given the contracts in Iraq.
[02:26:28.753 --> 02:26:29.573]  They're doing this.
[02:26:29.653 --> 02:26:30.414]  This happens.
[02:26:31.434 --> 02:26:33.915]  And as you said, it's a blip on the radar screen.
[02:26:34.215 --> 02:26:37.236]  That's one of about 10,000 evils we've seen confirmed.
[02:26:37.256 --> 02:26:45.338]  These articles for the British, MI6, MI5, Army, Intel, carry out almost all the terror as an excuse for police state in Northern Ireland.
[02:26:45.718 --> 02:26:48.519]  I mean, how do you get people to face the horror of this?
[02:26:49.099 --> 02:26:51.820]  Well, you know, that's a good question because I've been trying to do that for years.
[02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:57.882]  You know, I mean, people have read my book, The Medusa File, and they zero in on the chapter on the Finders case.
[02:26:57.942 --> 02:27:05.904]  The Finders case is where all these kids get picked up and then they disappear into the white slaves' pedophile sex market worldwide.
[02:27:06.337 --> 02:27:13.923]  And to places, you know, back during the Vietnam War, they were getting kids, they were getting orphans out of North Vietnam, and they still get kids out of North Korea.
[02:27:14.464 --> 02:27:16.605]  They buy them for ten bucks a piece or something, you know.
[02:27:17.206 --> 02:27:20.929]  They pick American kids up off the street, and then we see their faces on the back of milk cartons.
[02:27:20.969 --> 02:27:25.653]  And then they use that to put in the FEMA EAS system and call it Amber Alert.
[02:27:25.953 --> 02:27:28.575]  Yeah, and, you know, you've got to have a problem before you can have a solution.
[02:27:28.715 --> 02:27:31.416]  Well, they're always catching UN diplomats with a basement full of kids or women.
[02:27:31.456 --> 02:27:31.776]  I mean, it's...
[02:27:51.115 --> 02:27:52.476]  It's unbelievable.
[02:27:52.696 --> 02:27:53.797]  It's unbelievable.
[02:27:54.077 --> 02:27:55.097]  And that's exactly it.
[02:27:55.137 --> 02:27:58.959]  The more bizarre and unbelievable they can make it, the less people will believe it.
[02:27:58.999 --> 02:28:00.280]  They'll say, oh, that's science fiction.
[02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:02.321]  Well, tell folks about the Finders case in D.C.
[02:28:02.742 --> 02:28:11.987]  Well, that's the one where they found two guys in suits with a van full of kids down in Florida.
[02:28:12.167 --> 02:28:13.888]  They were on their way to Mexico.
[02:28:13.928 --> 02:28:17.690]  They stopped in a city park to let these kids get out and exercise a little bit.
[02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:21.303]  And these guys weren't related to these kids.
[02:28:21.343 --> 02:28:23.464]  They said they were taken into a school in Mexico.
[02:28:23.484 --> 02:28:26.607]  And the kids actually were orphans.
[02:28:27.247 --> 02:28:30.370]  They lived in a place in Washington, D.C.
[02:28:30.390 --> 02:28:31.550]  for orphans and yada, yada.
[02:28:31.791 --> 02:28:32.611]  And they were dirty.
[02:28:32.651 --> 02:28:34.132]  There were mattresses in the back.
[02:28:34.373 --> 02:28:36.714]  Oh, and computer disks, which were the real find.
[02:28:37.495 --> 02:28:39.216]  And so they started investigating, working with...
[02:28:40.473 --> 02:28:46.536]  The Treasury Department and Customs guys started looking at this, and they ended up finding this warehouse in Washington.
[02:28:46.556 --> 02:28:49.657]  When they went in there, they found a satanic temple.
[02:28:49.717 --> 02:28:52.038]  They found a movie studio.
[02:28:52.098 --> 02:28:52.958]  They found cameras.
[02:28:52.998 --> 02:28:54.419]  They found banks of computers.
[02:28:54.479 --> 02:28:55.379]  They found records.
[02:28:55.459 --> 02:28:59.241]  They found all kinds of weird stuff in jars in one bookcase.
[02:28:59.741 --> 02:29:05.564]  They found records that went to different countries, including Saudi Arabia, Europe, Germany, North Korea, South Korea, etc., etc.,
[02:29:06.434 --> 02:29:06.914]  We're good to go.
[02:29:24.031 --> 02:29:24.311]  I think so.
[02:29:47.717 --> 02:29:48.537]  And all the rest of that.
[02:29:48.617 --> 02:29:53.859]  Well, you take that and you compound it on an international level, and how many Bohemian Groves are really out there?
[02:29:54.519 --> 02:29:55.100]  We don't know.
[02:29:55.780 --> 02:29:57.540]  But we knew that this network had been discovered.
[02:29:57.560 --> 02:30:04.503]  At the very end, when the Treasury Department people came back in, and they wanted to look at the evidence that the Washington, D.C.
[02:30:04.543 --> 02:30:14.086]  Metro Police had sacked up in this place in all these trash bags, they were told that it was sealed up, they weren't allowed to look at it, and that it was a CIA internal matter.
[02:30:14.935 --> 02:30:18.296]  In other words, it directly was controlled by the CIA, and they would deal with it.
[02:30:18.316 --> 02:30:19.676]  And this is the problem with evil.
[02:30:19.756 --> 02:30:21.537]  You know, it starts with our men.
[02:30:21.657 --> 02:30:27.599]  Men, we know bringing heroin into America is bad, but it's just for the minorities.
[02:30:27.959 --> 02:30:29.159]  We've got to have this money.
[02:30:29.659 --> 02:30:32.020]  Congress won't give us the money to fight the communists.
[02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:34.640]  Lieutenant, are you ready to ship these drugs in?
[02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:35.181]  Yes, sir.
[02:30:35.261 --> 02:30:36.361]  For America, I'll do it.
[02:30:36.921 --> 02:30:42.565]  And then over time, they find more and more evil people until it grows to it's just a business heroin and cocaine.
[02:30:43.206 --> 02:30:45.928]  Well, if we don't do it, someone else will control it, and we have to.
[02:30:46.008 --> 02:30:48.369]  And then it's, oh, we'll do it with these kids.
[02:30:48.429 --> 02:30:53.353]  And it just grows and grows and grows and grows and grows and grows and grows and grows.
[02:30:54.242 --> 02:30:55.503]  And it's just incredible.
[02:30:56.624 --> 02:31:01.507]  Well, you can take a good officer or NCO and you can corrupt them very easily.
[02:31:01.527 --> 02:31:10.954]  You start them out with a Patriot bit by saying, these are control shipments and you're part of this top secret deal because we're tracking where these drugs go on the streets so we can arrest the pushers.
[02:31:10.994 --> 02:31:12.755]  And you're going, oh yeah, that's great, I want to help.
[02:31:13.120 --> 02:31:20.302]  Well, after you've helped transport some drugs for a while, they come back and you say, well, wait a minute, how long does it take to arrest these pushers?
[02:31:20.322 --> 02:31:30.284]  And they say, well, this has escalated into a different, we've had mission creep here, and what we're doing now is we're taking the money that we're making off this to finance other missions abroad that are top secret, you don't have a need to know.
[02:31:30.724 --> 02:31:34.205]  And then you finally come back and you say, look, I don't want to play this game anymore because I don't think it's right.
[02:31:34.225 --> 02:31:39.266]  And they say, well, I'm sorry, you're going to play the game because you're a part of it now, and if you don't, we're going to arrest you for drug trafficking.
[02:31:39.725 --> 02:31:44.468]  And most of the guys just go, hey, since we got all this money from this, you might as well take $10,000 of it.
[02:31:44.528 --> 02:31:47.289]  You know, your wife's back in the U.S.
[02:31:47.309 --> 02:31:48.029]  She needs the money.
[02:31:48.050 --> 02:31:48.910]  Why don't you go ahead?
[02:31:49.530 --> 02:31:50.211]  You have your choice.
[02:31:50.231 --> 02:31:51.771]  You can take the money or you can go to prison.
[02:31:51.791 --> 02:31:53.272]  We'll arrest you and blame the whole thing on you.
[02:31:53.292 --> 02:31:54.513]  So now where are you at?
[02:31:55.214 --> 02:32:09.341]  And this has happened to lots of people before, and I have received letters from former CIA assets who said, I'm in prison because I was running drugs for the CIA, and when I was going to blow the whistle, they decided to blame the whole thing on me and arrest me and convict me, and here I sit in Arizona.
[02:32:09.721 --> 02:32:11.382]  Well, they've caught them a hundred times.
[02:32:11.522 --> 02:32:14.763]  Cops at an airport will catch them if they flash CIA badges.
[02:32:15.063 --> 02:32:18.865]  They go ahead and take them in, and they get a call from the FBI saying, release them.
[02:32:21.685 --> 02:32:37.114]  If you grab the copy of the Medusa file and just look up some of these cases, look up the finders and look up the different drug running stuff, look up the Iran-Contra stuff I've got in there, and the same names over and over, the same organizations over and over, and it's all documented, it's all there, it's all the resources to look it up.
[02:32:37.134 --> 02:32:43.797]  Well, Senator McCamp was hired to disprove the stuff with the savings and loan and the pedophile stuff.
[02:32:44.277 --> 02:32:46.739]  He found out it was true, investigators of course were killed,
[02:32:47.579 --> 02:32:48.420]  We're good to go.
[02:33:12.933 --> 02:33:14.675]  Well, you know, the ways to control people...
[02:33:32.606 --> 02:33:32.886]  I think so.
[02:33:32.926 --> 02:33:33.126]  I think so.
[02:33:57.032 --> 02:33:57.312]  I think so.
[02:34:17.495 --> 02:34:20.077]  Because you can take the Patriot and say, this is for your country.
[02:34:20.117 --> 02:34:28.603]  We can't tell you everything, but it's for your country, and this is what you've got to do, because this is the best thing to do, and you've got to do it because you're a good patriotic person.
[02:34:28.643 --> 02:34:29.964]  We've checked you out, and we trust you.
[02:34:29.984 --> 02:34:31.625]  And you build this guy's ego up, say.
[02:34:32.006 --> 02:34:40.252]  And then after you've got his ego built up, he says, okay, I don't need to know everything, but I get to go beat James Bond, and you're going to give me some money and some operating expenses, and I get to carry a gun or whatever.
[02:34:40.272 --> 02:34:41.533]  And all of a sudden, this guy's on board.
[02:34:41.993 --> 02:34:43.394]  He thinks he's doing the right thing.
[02:34:43.454 --> 02:34:45.396]  He doesn't know he's working for evil.
[02:34:46.201 --> 02:34:52.343]  Until he's been there a little while, he's seen some of these things, he starts to ask some questions, and he doesn't get the right answers.
[02:34:52.383 --> 02:34:53.484]  At that point, he has a choice.
[02:34:54.004 --> 02:34:58.766]  Either join them, or try to get away, and that doesn't always work.
[02:34:58.786 --> 02:35:02.427]  They'll either kill him, debunk him, discredit him, or destroy him.
[02:35:04.648 --> 02:35:08.509]  Yeah, I've found they're a lot more commonly go after anyone who's ever been signed up with them.
[02:35:08.529 --> 02:35:13.211]  They seem to leave people alone who've never had any dealings with them or never taken anything from them.
[02:35:13.251 --> 02:35:15.212]  It's like a weird rule or code.
[02:35:15.292 --> 02:35:15.872]  What is that?
[02:35:16.385 --> 02:35:21.928]  Well, once that they've got a file, then they consider you an asset.
[02:35:21.948 --> 02:35:22.969]  It's once in, never out.
[02:35:23.369 --> 02:35:27.251]  But they have gone after people who are totally clueless.
[02:35:27.311 --> 02:35:32.854]  If they need somebody in a given area, they'll put their feelers out and they'll say, this is what we're looking for in this area.
[02:35:32.894 --> 02:35:37.417]  If you just happen to pop up on their radar screen, they're going to go out and try to recruit you.
[02:35:37.437 --> 02:35:39.138]  They tried to recruit me twice over the years.
[02:35:39.338 --> 02:35:51.965]  Well, no, I mean, I'm just talking about the globalists have some weird, that I've seen predominantly, I know they sometimes differ from that, that if you've ever worked for them in any way, then they have no problem going after you to take you out.
[02:35:52.245 --> 02:35:57.328]  But if you've never been involved with them, I've seen that folks that haven't been at any level, they tend to leave you alone more.
[02:35:57.768 --> 02:35:59.389]  Well, yeah, you're the kind that, if you're, you know...
[02:36:02.586 --> 02:36:04.548]  If they just see a periscope, they're going to depth charge you.
[02:36:04.568 --> 02:36:09.430]  But if you're a battleship out there making a lot of noise and everybody's noticing you, they're not going to do anything to you.
[02:36:09.470 --> 02:36:12.212]  What they're going to do is they're going to try to either debunk you or discredit you.
[02:36:12.232 --> 02:36:12.712]  Which they've done.
[02:36:12.752 --> 02:36:15.113]  I've been attacked by the New York Times and everything else you can imagine.
[02:36:15.153 --> 02:36:22.577]  Yeah, but as far as physical damage, it would be counterproductive because all it would do is prove your point.
[02:36:22.657 --> 02:36:24.458]  And they don't want to help you prove your point.
[02:36:24.598 --> 02:36:27.380]  Well, I was told that the one time I got death-threaded by the government.
[02:36:28.624 --> 02:36:29.665]  We're good to go.
[02:36:51.437 --> 02:36:54.659]  Well, at that time, that was a sensitive issue that a seed could grow into a big plant.
[02:37:19.346 --> 02:37:20.907]  Yeah, that was in the whole investigation.
[02:37:20.927 --> 02:37:22.207]  It was big in the news, I guess.
[02:37:22.407 --> 02:37:22.807]  That's right.
[02:37:22.867 --> 02:37:26.848]  You were planting the seed, and they didn't want that to flower into a big tree that everybody was going to notice.
[02:37:27.809 --> 02:37:32.730]  You know, when I did the book, JFK, The Dead Witnesses, I had 115 dead witnesses there.
[02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:37.731]  A lot of them died mysteriously just before they were supposed to testify.
[02:37:37.791 --> 02:37:43.233]  Well, the witnesses that are still alive today, or have been up until recently, were people who...
[02:37:43.806 --> 02:37:49.348]  Who came forward and said everything they had to say right up front, and it was too late to put the cork in the bottle.
[02:37:49.808 --> 02:37:50.868]  So they were still alive.
[02:37:50.948 --> 02:37:56.610]  That's like Jennifer Flowers, when she's on Chris Matthews, and she says Clinton is having people killed, and Chris Matthews, what?
[02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:58.110]  She goes, yeah, over 100.
[02:37:58.170 --> 02:37:59.550]  He goes, well, why are you still alive?
[02:37:59.571 --> 02:38:01.671]  She goes, because I'm on this show, I'm on other shows.
[02:38:01.811 --> 02:38:08.253]  Yeah, because you stand up and you say, well, all of a sudden if they killed her, it would prove her point.
[02:38:08.792 --> 02:38:09.553]  Let's take some calls.
[02:38:09.933 --> 02:38:11.234]  Doug in West Virginia.
[02:38:11.274 --> 02:38:11.974]  Doug, you're on the air.
[02:38:12.034 --> 02:38:12.454]  Go ahead.
[02:38:12.855 --> 02:38:30.966]  Yes, I've been a private pilot for 10 years, and I'm not an instrument-rated pilot, but I know that when you do open up a flight plan, you initiate a dialogue with ATC, and if you stop talking to them, especially if you go off course, and especially if you turned off a transponder,
[02:38:32.090 --> 02:38:36.352]  Within 15 minutes in every case before 9-1-1, F-16s have surrounded you.
[02:38:36.572 --> 02:38:36.732]  Yes.
[02:38:37.453 --> 02:38:42.895]  And in the case of Payne Stewart, the golfer, 15 minutes they were around him, 18 minutes they were ready to shoot him down, they didn't.
[02:38:43.855 --> 02:38:46.817]  The most controlled airspace in the world, nothing was done.
[02:38:46.897 --> 02:38:48.177]  Colonel Roberts, you want to comment to that?
[02:38:48.858 --> 02:38:58.462]  Well, you know, once you initiate a flight plan and activate it and take off, then you're going to be assigned a transponder code.
[02:38:58.482 --> 02:39:00.663]  Well, you can initiate a flight plan and fly VFR on 1200s,
[02:39:01.522 --> 02:39:11.529]  But once you enter the air traffic system with a transponder code, yeah, you're going to be locked in on it until you land someplace or request release into VFR uncontrolled.
[02:39:12.729 --> 02:39:20.374]  But as far as what's happened since 9-11, it's hard for me to comment on what they do today because I haven't been pilot in command of an aircraft since then.
[02:39:20.394 --> 02:39:23.496]  I always try to ride in the back seat now with the flight attendant.
[02:39:23.536 --> 02:39:25.358]  You know what I mean?
[02:39:26.018 --> 02:39:27.399]  Anything else, Doug?
[02:39:27.856 --> 02:39:28.156]  Oh, yes.
[02:39:28.617 --> 02:39:30.698]  Well, Alex, I've been listening to you about three months.
[02:39:31.179 --> 02:39:37.123]  I didn't know about you before, but when this happened, you know, I just didn't... I couldn't believe the story.
[02:39:37.183 --> 02:39:45.590]  I mean, it was just so hysterical, you know, the kerosene, this magical elixir sent by Allah to melt steel of the infidels and this craziness in the news.
[02:39:45.610 --> 02:39:48.733]  The building seven implodes faster than a building would fall.
[02:39:48.893 --> 02:39:52.335]  Only detonations floor by floor could make it fall in 3.1 seconds.
[02:39:53.316 --> 02:39:55.178]  And I put it... I had... I was in...
[02:39:55.796 --> 02:40:08.488]  Still in college, I made a webpage that I just worked on just a little bit from December 01 to voting day, where of course, voting day 02, of course now your vote's not going to count because the Republican's going to win by, what is it, like 18,181 votes.
[02:40:08.508 --> 02:40:10.690]  That's happened over and over and over.
[02:40:11.971 --> 02:40:17.997]  And anyway, I think that the thing to do is to be vocal, you know,
[02:40:18.934 --> 02:40:36.017]  In their face, because when I did this, I emailed it to every senator, every congressman, every state governor, every major media, and I said, basically I did my own thoughts, and I linked to just hundreds of other website-type people that will scientifically explain different things.
[02:40:36.637 --> 02:40:39.558]  But no response, because I said, I'd like to be wrong.
[02:40:39.758 --> 02:40:40.678]  Show me how I'm wrong.
[02:40:40.958 --> 02:40:46.279]  I even went to the FBI tips line a couple times and just showed them my webpage and said, look, this is what I think.
[02:40:46.319 --> 02:40:47.639]  I think that Bush is a puppet, and
[02:40:48.004 --> 02:40:53.327]  And what he did that day, you know, he knew before he left his hotel that that first building had been bombed.
[02:40:53.407 --> 02:40:54.948]  Why did he go to that school?
[02:40:55.268 --> 02:41:00.631]  Because since Truman's time, the biggest fear of the Secret Service is that a plane would fly into the building where the president was.
[02:41:00.671 --> 02:41:02.932]  They hardened the White House for Truman.
[02:41:03.232 --> 02:41:03.773]  Absolutely.
[02:41:03.813 --> 02:41:04.373]  Got to let you go.
[02:41:04.453 --> 02:41:05.073]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:05.113 --> 02:41:06.194]  Final segment with Colonel Roberts.
[02:41:06.214 --> 02:41:08.876]  We'll talk to Dave and Michael and a few others.
[02:41:09.476 --> 02:41:12.077]  And we'll also tell you how to get Colonel Roberts' books.
[02:41:12.097 --> 02:41:12.658]  They're excellent.
[02:41:12.698 --> 02:41:13.298]  My films.
[02:41:13.318 --> 02:41:14.919]  And we're going to be in Kansas City.
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:24.009]  This Saturday, Colonel Roberts and myself, John Statler, will be there as well, and a few other speakers, from 10 in the morning until 7 at night.
[02:41:24.610 --> 02:41:27.313]  Colonel Roberts will be doing an incredible PowerPoint presentation.
[02:41:27.353 --> 02:41:28.374]  I'll be doing one as well.
[02:41:29.535 --> 02:41:30.075]  Stay with us.
[02:41:30.095 --> 02:41:31.597]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[02:41:31.637 --> 02:41:34.160]  Got a lot of key information on today about the pure evil we face.
[02:41:37.046 --> 02:41:44.414]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:44.694 --> 02:41:49.460]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:49.660 --> 02:41:55.306]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.546 --> 02:42:00.067]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:42:00.287 --> 02:42:07.429]  The casual society control grid, implanable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:42:07.469 --> 02:42:12.010]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:42:12.170 --> 02:42:14.671]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:42:14.911 --> 02:42:21.493]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:42:21.493 --> 02:42:21.733]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:36.022 --> 02:42:46.751]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:42:46.932 --> 02:42:54.538]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.778 --> 02:42:57.901]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:42:58.201 --> 02:43:01.345]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:43:01.425 --> 02:43:02.707]  The water level is always visible.
[02:43:16.744 --> 02:43:22.666]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:43:22.906 --> 02:43:27.167]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:44:08.140 --> 02:44:08.480]  We're good to go.
[02:44:36.663 --> 02:44:42.326]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:44.107 --> 02:44:47.568]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:44:47.608 --> 02:44:50.269]  Real quick, Dave in California, then Mike in New York.
[02:44:50.289 --> 02:44:51.930]  Dave, you're on the air with Colonel Roberts.
[02:44:52.050 --> 02:44:52.370]  Welcome.
[02:44:52.730 --> 02:44:53.691]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:44:55.111 --> 02:44:56.072]  I've got two things for you.
[02:44:56.312 --> 02:44:59.553]  One, I'm sitting here looking at a copy of the Washington Times.
[02:44:59.573 --> 02:45:00.994]  This is from 1988 when they...
[02:45:03.274 --> 02:45:10.339]  They broke a story about a nest of homosexuals that had been purchasing young boys and having them tour the White House and such.
[02:45:10.379 --> 02:45:12.940]  Do you folks remember that particular issue?
[02:45:14.201 --> 02:45:16.022]  I do remember the...
[02:45:17.709 --> 02:45:23.714]  Barney Frank type stuff and underage stuff, and I do remember some of that.
[02:45:24.335 --> 02:45:31.460]  I've got a 90s article out of the Washington Times where David Gergen admits wild things going on at the Grove, but Colonel Roberts?
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:38.486]  Yeah, I remember that case specifically, and it surfaced for like one or two days and then disappeared, and we never heard of it again.
[02:45:38.966 --> 02:45:42.669]  Okay, well, if you're interested, if you go to Indymedia.org, you can find it.
[02:45:42.970 --> 02:45:45.532]  Some of the principals involved were Mr. Dutcher, D-U-T-C-H-E-R,
[02:45:47.668 --> 02:45:49.369]  Well, remember Chandra Levy?
[02:45:49.650 --> 02:45:51.311]  This was even on Fox and CNN.
[02:45:51.331 --> 02:45:55.354]  It ended when it broke that she was involved in some type of weird satanic sex cult.
[02:45:55.414 --> 02:45:56.595]  Did you hear that, Colonel?
[02:46:14.184 --> 02:46:17.945]  Yeah, and it didn't surprise me either because of all these other findings we have.
[02:46:18.065 --> 02:46:23.406]  There is a huge satanic underground movement that's linked to the homosexual community in Washington, D.C.
[02:46:23.446 --> 02:46:24.747]  And we're not the only ones saying this.
[02:46:24.787 --> 02:46:27.508]  I mean, this stuff pops up on TV.
[02:46:27.748 --> 02:46:33.949]  Oh, yeah, and it's linked to, believe it or not, a place in Haiti, which, you know, we went to Haiti, didn't we?
[02:46:34.049 --> 02:46:34.709]  I wonder why.
[02:46:35.250 --> 02:46:40.631]  And so we've got this thing that's linked down there, and there was an investigation going on down there, I think Port-au-Prince or wherever it is,
[02:46:41.201 --> 02:46:45.205]  And the records disappeared after we arrived during that clinic.
[02:46:45.225 --> 02:46:46.967]  And their president had been doing something weird.
[02:46:47.267 --> 02:46:48.889]  Thanks for the call, David.
[02:46:48.909 --> 02:46:49.690]  Yeah, Papa Doc.
[02:46:51.151 --> 02:46:51.692]  Pardon me, sir?
[02:46:51.872 --> 02:46:52.853]  Papa Doc Duvalier.
[02:46:53.093 --> 02:46:53.373]  Yeah.
[02:46:53.614 --> 02:46:54.234]  And Baby Doc.
[02:46:54.615 --> 02:46:55.475]  Somebody do me a favor.
[02:46:55.556 --> 02:46:58.218]  Email that story to tips at infowars.com.
[02:46:58.518 --> 02:47:00.821]  I've seen it years ago, but I'd like to have it again.
[02:47:01.221 --> 02:47:01.982]  Mike in New York.
[02:47:02.042 --> 02:47:02.563]  Last caller.
[02:47:02.583 --> 02:47:02.903]  Go ahead.
[02:47:04.275 --> 02:47:05.096]  Yes, hello, Alex?
[02:47:05.457 --> 02:47:05.818]  Yes, sir.
[02:47:05.838 --> 02:47:07.220]  How you doing, Colonel Roberts?
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:07.681]  Fine.
[02:47:08.041 --> 02:47:08.221]  Good.
[02:47:08.722 --> 02:47:09.964]  I have two questions, actually.
[02:47:10.445 --> 02:47:14.131]  You were aware of the top-off incident today at the Chicago airport?
[02:47:15.495 --> 02:47:18.377]  Well, government federalization, martial law drills, yes.
[02:47:18.637 --> 02:47:19.237]  Right, right.
[02:47:19.297 --> 02:47:19.837]  I'm just wondering.
[02:47:19.857 --> 02:47:21.438]  There's also one going in Seattle, I think.
[02:47:21.458 --> 02:47:23.399]  Yeah, martial law drills, all over the country.
[02:47:23.439 --> 02:47:26.261]  Right, I just wanted to get your point of view on that.
[02:47:26.341 --> 02:47:28.201]  Well, it's a martial law drill.
[02:47:28.241 --> 02:47:29.382]  We talked about that last hour.
[02:47:29.422 --> 02:47:30.042]  Colonel Roberts?
[02:47:30.322 --> 02:47:32.484]  Yeah, and what it is, it does several things.
[02:47:32.504 --> 02:47:34.524]  We're going to have more of these pop up.
[02:47:34.544 --> 02:47:37.146]  They're going to go into a wider scale coordinated with each other.
[02:47:37.466 --> 02:47:39.767]  They're also flexing the communications system.
[02:47:40.107 --> 02:47:41.048]  And nighttime curfews, running man world.
[02:47:41.088 --> 02:47:41.969]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[02:47:42.089 --> 02:47:42.349]  Really do.
[02:47:42.370 --> 02:47:43.511]  Colonel Robert, title folks, get your books.
[02:47:59.506 --> 02:48:05.151]  Well, they can get on RifleWarrior.com, www.RifleWarrior.com, and order them right there.
[02:48:05.231 --> 02:48:10.516]  They can order them through their local bookstore, and they may or may not get them because they seem to disappear off the computer all the time.
[02:48:10.556 --> 02:48:12.818]  Yeah, best-selling books until you talk about the New World Order.
[02:48:13.078 --> 02:48:13.518]  That's right.
[02:48:13.558 --> 02:48:21.285]  All the other books, you can get those at any bookstore, but if you go to Medusa File or Kill Zone or Dead Witnesses or Doorway to Hell, you'll find it hard to get them.
[02:48:21.305 --> 02:48:22.206]  What's that number to order as well?
[02:48:23.064 --> 02:48:26.746]  And it's 918-386-2715.
[02:48:26.786 --> 02:48:30.148]  That number's on the website, and it'll tell you also how to order the books.
[02:48:30.228 --> 02:48:34.089]  Okay, hey, I'll see you this Saturday, Kansas City, for our presentations.
[02:48:34.610 --> 02:48:35.650]  Okay, we'll talk before that.
[02:48:35.670 --> 02:48:36.571]  Appreciate you, Colonel.
[02:48:36.611 --> 02:48:37.071]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:37.651 --> 02:48:38.892]  All right, I'm out of time.
[02:48:39.682 --> 02:48:41.983]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard.
[02:48:42.003 --> 02:48:48.526]  If you want my videos, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, and I mean total, is out two hours, 37 minutes.

[02:48:54.128 --> 02:48:56.829]  Infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order them.

[02:48:59.090 --> 02:48:59.990]  And in one hour...
[02:49:09.754 --> 02:49:19.505]  I'll be on News Talk 1260 KWNX for our Central Texas listeners, 1260 AM from 3 to 5, filling in for their drive time host.
[02:49:19.545 --> 02:49:21.987]  So 1260 AM in one hour, back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:22.588 --> 02:49:24.891]  Get the videos, get the word out, defend the republic.
[02:49:26.432 --> 02:49:32.779]  By now you've all heard about Prostate Wellness from OneSource Health Products, the natural product to help men maintain and improve their prostate health.
[02:49:33.019 --> 02:49:36.944]  Did you know each year over 400,000 men in the United States alone undergo...
