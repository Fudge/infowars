[00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:07.100]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:15.311]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:17.012]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:18.853]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.513 --> 00:00:20.334]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:23.015]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:26.436]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.837 --> 00:00:30.918]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.988 --> 00:00:55.350]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.451]  It's another edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:58.551 --> 00:00:59.592]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:01.693]  It is the 12th of August, 2003.
[00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:05.253]  We're good to go.
[00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:35.955]  But that doesn't matter, folks.
[00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:47.659]  Wall to wall, everywhere, all anyone is talking about is Arnold Schwarzenegger running for governor of California.
[00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:51.000]  And I know that he's charismatic.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.880]  He's good-looking.
[00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:55.121]  It's interesting.
[00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:57.462]  He's played this archetypal role.
[00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:08.540]  Hercules character over and over again, and people have this image of him being the super male stamped on our psyche.
[00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:11.782]  And there's some validity to that.
[00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:15.084]  He was the German powerlifting champion.
[00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:16.504]  A lot of folks don't know that.
[00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:23.929]  He's also an atheist who makes fun of Jesus Christ in several of his books that I've read.
[00:02:25.836 --> 00:02:34.862]  Time Magazine last night, I was on their website, and it said that Arnold's dad, they were comparing him to Ronald Reagan favorably.
[00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:36.203]  The establishment likes him.
[00:02:37.084 --> 00:02:39.866]  And they talked about how Ronald Reagan's dad was a shoe salesman.
[00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:43.809]  And Arnold Schwarzenegger's dad was a police chief.
[00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.891]  Oh, yeah, he was a police chief.
[00:02:47.952 --> 00:02:50.093]  Did they say what he was a police chief of?
[00:02:50.113 --> 00:02:50.594]  Just...
[00:02:55.021 --> 00:03:08.907]  And folks, I've been reading news articles and scanning stuff for years, and I know a lot about Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the stuff that's confirmed... I mean, this guy is Bill Clinton on steroids.
[00:03:09.988 --> 00:03:10.968]  Pun intended.
[00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.410]  He's Bill Clinton on steroids.
[00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.671]  And you notice they're totally ignoring that.
[00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:23.574]  The guy is pro-homosexual marriage, he's anti-gun, pro-abortion...
[00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:35.176]  He says he's for open borders, but it turns out he supposedly voted years ago, all of this carefully calculated, against giving illegals a bunch of free stuff.
[00:03:36.857 --> 00:03:44.703]  Arnold said decades ago that he wanted to run for president or that he wanted to be the head of a national police force.
[00:03:47.279 --> 00:04:03.404]  And there's a good chance he'll end up being one of the two, because he's in with the Illuminati, he's married into the Kennedys, and we will address Arnold Schwarzenegger, or Arnold the Blackhead, that's what his name means, means Arnold the Slave.
[00:04:03.424 --> 00:04:09.126]  We will discuss Arnold the Austrian a little bit in this hour.
[00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:11.206]  I'll spend five more minutes on the subject.
[00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:13.907]  I would not talk about Colby Bryant, but
[00:04:14.597 --> 00:04:31.371]  Because Arnold is a member of the Bohemian Grove, because his father was a high-level Gestapo officer responsible for rounding up a lot of people in Austria, because he hates Jesus Christ and is a sociopath, we will talk about him.
[00:04:32.112 --> 00:04:37.376]  He is the perfect Luciferian bee, basically, in the Luciferian beehive.
[00:04:39.118 --> 00:04:42.821]  So we'll address this individual question.
[00:04:43.963 --> 00:04:46.665]  And I'm not going to get into any of the sexual stuff.
[00:04:46.725 --> 00:04:48.146]  Believe me, that's legion.
[00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:55.111]  I'm going to ignore all of that and just get into, well, he attends a satanic club.
[00:04:55.131 --> 00:04:57.352]  His father was a Gestapo officer.
[00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:01.095]  He is against your guns and he loves abortion.
[00:05:01.115 --> 00:05:07.399]  Homosexual marriage is a great thing, but hey, President Bush says he's wonderful.
[00:05:10.254 --> 00:05:14.237]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[00:05:14.678 --> 00:05:21.724]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.
[00:05:22.124 --> 00:05:26.227]  With an ozone generator, you can kill bacteria and viruses in your drinking water.
[00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:30.011]  Get rid of that stale air in your house that keeps recirculating.
[00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:35.195]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[00:05:35.755 --> 00:05:37.437]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.
[00:05:59.236 --> 00:06:09.004]  So call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your personal ozone generator or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:13.888]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:14.068 --> 00:06:18.512]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:18.632 --> 00:06:23.016]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:25.858]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:06:26.178 --> 00:06:30.399]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:37.381]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:39.581]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:39.902 --> 00:06:50.324]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:50.524 --> 00:06:53.225]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[00:06:53.365 --> 00:06:54.306]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:08.943 --> 00:07:10.905]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:07:11.005 --> 00:07:11.645]  Hello, folks.
[00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:21.713]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:07:22.093 --> 00:07:26.616]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:38.005]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:07:38.365 --> 00:07:39.066]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:02.269]  Big Brother.
[00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:03.130]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.090]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.050]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.056 --> 00:08:21.936]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:21.956 --> 00:08:26.577]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:30.918]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.098 --> 00:08:33.539]  All right, folks.
[00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.259]  Thanks for joining me.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.180]  It's Tuesday, the 12th of August, 2003.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.240]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:48.242]  The websites are prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, and infowars.net.
[00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.122]  And I do want to take...
[00:08:50.726 --> 00:08:51.367]  We're good to go.
[00:09:13.895 --> 00:09:42.348]  Any global story, national story, local story, something that you think is important that I should know about, or some propaganda you saw on the nightly news, or in a sitcom or drama, or in a movie, because that's where more of the New World Order program is shot at us than any other places in the mediums of fiction on television and in print, as well as movies.
[00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:47.582]  So anything you want to discuss, it's wide open phones.
[00:09:47.702 --> 00:10:00.946]  If you disagree with me, if you want to confront me, if you want to say that I'm a liar and that government is holy and that government can do no wrong and that it's conservative to turn your guns in, I disagree with that.
[00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:06.507]  I believe it's not conservative to have open borders and to turn your guns in and to be for abortion.
[00:10:07.156 --> 00:10:09.797]  But again, I'm one of those old-fashioned conservatives.
[00:10:10.458 --> 00:10:15.480]  But if you're a mindless liberal or an idiot neocon, you're always welcome to call in 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.481]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:26.626]  And I'm going to go to your calls early in this hour, and if you disagree with me, tell the folks answering the phones, and you will go to the front of the line.
[00:10:35.146 --> 00:10:40.152]  We don't screen calls other than to ask where you're calling from and what your first name is.
[00:10:41.253 --> 00:10:51.825]  But if you tell them, if you tell Mark who's running the show that you disagree with me, you go to the front of the line.
[00:10:51.865 --> 00:10:54.749]  The one type of call screening we do.
[00:10:56.821 --> 00:11:05.365]  And I guess occasionally, I did this in the past, I would ask how someone was listening, whether it was on AM, FM, shortwave, internet, satellite, and we've quit doing that.
[00:11:05.385 --> 00:11:06.885]  Maybe we should start doing that again.
[00:11:06.945 --> 00:11:07.306]  I don't know.
[00:11:08.386 --> 00:11:09.226]  All right, I'll do it.
[00:11:09.827 --> 00:11:10.267]  I'll do it.
[00:11:11.007 --> 00:11:12.068]  You want it, you've got it.
[00:11:12.648 --> 00:11:14.028]  We'll talk about Colby Bryant.
[00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:16.730]  We'll talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:22.232]  We won't talk about the three dozen Level 4 bioweapons labs they're going to build around the country.
[00:11:22.976 --> 00:11:24.337]  That the Baltimore Sun reported.
[00:11:24.357 --> 00:11:28.740]  The government said they're going to build systems that produce thousands of gallons of liquid death.
[00:11:29.961 --> 00:11:32.422]  And they've had monkeys and stuff escape from these in the past.
[00:11:33.423 --> 00:11:37.485]  Stuff that makes West Nile and smallpox look like mother's milk.
[00:11:38.806 --> 00:11:40.527]  We won't talk about that.
[00:11:40.547 --> 00:11:46.911]  We won't talk about how all the microbiologists that are in race-specific bioweapon production who are all dropping dead.
[00:11:46.931 --> 00:11:47.832]  We won't talk about that.
[00:11:48.496 --> 00:11:58.400]  We won't talk about how they're putting in systems to shut down all the highways and lock down all the cities and signing deals to bring in foreign troops publicly to oppress the American people.
[00:11:58.981 --> 00:12:02.902]  We won't talk about how they're openly building FEMA camps everywhere and how it's in the mainstream news.
[00:12:04.923 --> 00:12:08.244]  We will not talk about how there's been more bombings in Israel or how U.S.
[00:12:08.285 --> 00:12:13.567]  troops are dying of a bizarre illness that liquefies their organs, being called...
[00:12:14.781 --> 00:12:15.422]  Pneumonia.
[00:12:15.482 --> 00:12:18.184]  Pneumonia doesn't liquefy your internal organs, folks.
[00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:19.285]  Ebola does.
[00:12:21.546 --> 00:12:22.567]  We won't talk about that.
[00:12:22.947 --> 00:12:36.758]  We won't talk about how UNESCO, the UN organization that runs our public schools, that Bush has signed on to and increased funding for, says that the family is the enemy and, quote, must be destroyed and is a, quote, disease.
[00:12:38.099 --> 00:12:41.722]  We won't talk about how they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:12:42.748 --> 00:12:44.969]  We'll talk about Colby Bryant and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:12:47.090 --> 00:13:01.016]  It's the equivalent of talking about what color to paint your toenails when you're two inches from running your car off of a cliff over a 5,000-foot ravine with spikes at the bottom.
[00:13:01.936 --> 00:13:03.597]  But we'll talk about it.
[00:13:03.697 --> 00:13:05.497]  We'll talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger right now.
[00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:06.058]  You want it?
[00:13:06.538 --> 00:13:06.998]  You got it.
[00:13:07.038 --> 00:13:07.818]  Let's talk about him.
[00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:11.640]  Just so happens that I look like a potato right now.
[00:13:13.104 --> 00:13:14.605]  But not anymore.
[00:13:14.625 --> 00:13:16.465]  I've been running and lifting weights and swimming again.
[00:13:16.485 --> 00:13:17.626]  I've lost now 20 pounds.
[00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:23.788]  But the point is, in high school I played football, baseball, track, all that stuff.
[00:13:24.089 --> 00:13:32.632]  And when I got out of high school, I was accustomed to exercising a lot, and I went and bought Arnold Schwarzenegger's Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding.
[00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:39.375]  And I followed the Arnold system of working out two hours a day.
[00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:52.744]  Now, I was later told by modern bodybuilders that you could only work out two hours a day and get really big if you're taking anabolic steroids, which I never did.
[00:13:53.931 --> 00:13:59.095]  But I weighed 180 pounds, and I could bench press 330, 340 pounds.
[00:13:59.575 --> 00:14:01.056]  I was able to lift that once or twice.
[00:14:01.537 --> 00:14:06.901]  But generally, I mean, I could put on 225 pounds on the bench press and do 30 reps of it, folks.
[00:14:07.461 --> 00:14:09.503]  I can't even hardly do that once now, okay?
[00:14:09.783 --> 00:14:13.325]  I've sat here like a potato for seven years, eight years.
[00:14:13.425 --> 00:14:17.949]  But when I got into college, for four or five years, I did nothing but lift weights and jog every day.
[00:14:18.109 --> 00:14:18.589]  And I was...
[00:14:20.074 --> 00:14:21.755]  Well, there's photos of it on the net.
[00:14:21.815 --> 00:14:25.817]  Just type Alex Jones, click on photos on Google, and you'll see pictures.
[00:14:25.837 --> 00:14:29.998]  Because I was still in pretty good shape when I started doing radio and TV.
[00:14:30.058 --> 00:14:38.882]  And one time, again, a friend took a photo and posted it on, well, got it posted in the newspaper, and then now it's been out there forever.
[00:14:38.942 --> 00:14:46.786]  But the point is, is that I thought, man, Arnold Schwarzenegger's really neat, and so I'm going to read books he's written.
[00:14:48.127 --> 00:14:56.994]  And I read his encyclopedia of bodybuilding, which really the recipe to get big in there is only if you're on anabolics.
[00:14:57.014 --> 00:14:58.855]  You can't work out two hours a day and get big, folks.
[00:14:58.895 --> 00:14:59.536]  It'll tear you down.
[00:15:00.697 --> 00:15:08.142]  But if you're not taking drugs, you want to get big and strong, just work out 30, 45 minutes a day with weights.
[00:15:08.202 --> 00:15:15.548]  But the point is that I went and got what is evolution of a bodybuilder or whatever it's called.
[00:15:15.608 --> 00:15:17.249]  It's somewhere in a bookshelf in my house.
[00:15:18.144 --> 00:15:19.886]  And it's, you know, I don't like Jesus.
[00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:20.906]  I'm Jesus.
[00:15:22.168 --> 00:15:22.808]  I'm God.
[00:15:22.848 --> 00:15:24.029]  It's all about me.
[00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:26.911]  I grew up in a castle.
[00:15:26.971 --> 00:15:28.653]  My dad was a police chief.
[00:15:30.174 --> 00:15:34.197]  You know, I basically was the big boss in the community.
[00:15:34.758 --> 00:15:38.781]  Everyone submitted to me and brought me cream milk so I could get bigger.
[00:15:40.803 --> 00:15:42.224]  It's all about yourself.
[00:15:44.236 --> 00:16:05.660]  And then, you know, over the years, I read a lot, and I'd see where Schwarzenegger made bizarre comments about the New World Order, and then I found out he was a member of the Bohemian Grove, and then I'm watching all the news channels last night, and they're, well, Arnold Schwarzenegger is for abortion, he's anti-gun, he's for homosexual marriage, but he's conflicting.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:13.281]  He says he's for open borders now, but he did vote to restrict payments to illegals in a proposition years ago.
[00:16:15.911 --> 00:16:19.032]  But then, last night, I decided to talk about Arnold.
[00:16:19.052 --> 00:16:20.653]  So I said, I'll stop ignoring this.
[00:16:20.733 --> 00:16:22.514]  It's such a big story, top story.
[00:16:22.574 --> 00:16:23.694]  What a joke.
[00:16:25.215 --> 00:16:29.216]  I said, I will go, and I will look at all of this.
[00:16:30.737 --> 00:16:35.498]  And so I went to Time Magazine, and they have him compared to Ronald Reagan.
[00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:42.161]  And frankly, I think Arnold Schwarzenegger as an individual is far more impressive than Ronald Reagan.
[00:16:43.025 --> 00:16:45.046]  I think Ronald Reagan was a far better person.
[00:16:45.227 --> 00:16:49.409]  I'm just saying, Arnold really is an alpha male.
[00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:55.573]  So I'm sitting there reading the comparisons, and it says, you click on one, what did his father do?
[00:16:55.913 --> 00:16:58.575]  Well, Ronald Reagan's father was a shoe salesman in the Midwest.
[00:16:58.975 --> 00:17:00.035]  What did Arnold's dad do?
[00:17:00.356 --> 00:17:01.636]  Oh, he was a police chief.
[00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:04.138]  Well...
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.864]  It just so happens I've read Esquire and all the other news articles over the years about Arnold.
[00:17:10.064 --> 00:17:13.707]  When I'm sitting there to get a haircut or something, you'll open up the magazine and read about it.
[00:17:14.188 --> 00:17:27.239]  The guy's dad admittedly was a high-level Gestapo officer because if you're a captain in the Gestapo, that's like a full-bird colonel.
[00:17:27.659 --> 00:17:32.644]  Hitler had the Gestapo where it was like special forces of day.
[00:17:33.795 --> 00:17:36.496]  It was over the regular army.
[00:17:36.516 --> 00:17:44.558]  And by the end, a SS colonel could override anybody they wanted to in the regular army.
[00:17:46.258 --> 00:17:54.640]  And Arnold's dad was involved in purges and arrests of Germans and oppressing people in Austria.
[00:17:55.821 --> 00:17:57.801]  And a really sinister guy, folks.
[00:17:57.941 --> 00:18:00.622]  These are very, very sinister people.
[00:18:02.295 --> 00:18:07.818]  Arnold's brother, who died in an automobile accident, who was older than him, was born at the end of the war.
[00:18:07.898 --> 00:18:13.361]  He was the product of a bloodlines analysis SS marriage.
[00:18:13.901 --> 00:18:22.806]  If you were a captain or above that, and some records show he got even higher by the last year of the war, though those have been lost.
[00:18:25.508 --> 00:18:27.809]  It was all gone over very carefully, so...
[00:18:29.102 --> 00:18:32.183]  And my wife was saying, you know, how can he be governor if he's not a citizen?
[00:18:32.223 --> 00:18:37.165]  Well, in Mexico, you can't be elected to a federal position unless you were born there.
[00:18:37.705 --> 00:18:41.567]  It's that way in Germany, it's that way in France, and it makes a lot of sense.
[00:18:42.067 --> 00:18:49.610]  America's different, though, because we were a nation of immigrants up front, and so you can be anything but the president, folks.
[00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:53.211]  And we're in a lot of trouble, okay?
[00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:56.833]  We're in a lot of trouble, because they've been grooming Arnold for a long time,
[00:18:57.583 --> 00:19:01.245]  And he's in with the Bushes and others and other neocons to be president.
[00:19:01.825 --> 00:19:03.806]  And they've got bills lined up to do it.
[00:19:03.846 --> 00:19:04.746]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:19:05.606 --> 00:19:08.287]  It's just that he has a lot of charisma and he's not stupid.
[00:19:09.128 --> 00:19:11.969]  He is not stupid, contrary to what the news has to say.
[00:19:11.989 --> 00:19:20.973]  I mean, you watch the documentary Pumping Iron about Arnold, and the guy is a total cunning, devilish sociopath.
[00:19:22.873 --> 00:19:26.515]  And the mean things he does to people and the way he operates...
[00:19:27.609 --> 00:19:30.090]  And I know people that know Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.150]  Very aggressive, very rude, very mean.
[00:19:34.011 --> 00:19:46.194]  I've seen clips of him just ten years ago where he'd start yelling and cussing at press conferences, cramming two apples in his mouth at one time with juice spraying out of his mouth.
[00:19:46.954 --> 00:19:49.114]  I mean, the guy is a wicked devil, folks.
[00:19:50.575 --> 00:19:52.055]  And you just need to know that.
[00:19:55.117 --> 00:20:00.820]  And so I know all about Arnold Schwarzenegger, folks, and I've been to the Grove, and he just loves the Grove.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.380]  It's a German institution.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.501]  He'd better love it.
[00:20:04.521 --> 00:20:08.483]  As Helmut Schmidt said in his own book, Men in Powers, that he was German Chancellor.
[00:20:12.393 --> 00:20:12.913]  It's here.
[00:20:13.194 --> 00:20:13.914]  It's powerful.
[00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:22.798]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.079 --> 00:20:24.939]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.301]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:31.763]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[00:20:32.063 --> 00:20:37.788]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[00:20:37.968 --> 00:20:39.730]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.133]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[00:20:43.333 --> 00:20:44.894]  Get the powerful Berkey now.

[00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:47.451]  We're good to go.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.682]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:22:13.122 --> 00:22:17.664]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:22:18.044 --> 00:22:22.906]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:22:23.286 --> 00:22:25.067]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:22:25.107 --> 00:22:26.127]  can barely be read.
[00:22:26.147 --> 00:22:27.388]  It has faded that much.
[00:22:27.748 --> 00:22:31.649]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:40.272]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.

[00:23:01.587 --> 00:23:02.228]  Do it today.
[00:23:02.569 --> 00:23:03.069]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:23:07.822 --> 00:23:08.662]  Do you want the news?
[00:23:08.923 --> 00:23:10.123]  I mean the real news.
[00:23:10.423 --> 00:23:11.904]  Because you're sure not getting it now.
[00:23:12.284 --> 00:23:15.406]  If you'll open your ears, we'll open your eyes, and we'll open your mind.
[00:23:15.726 --> 00:23:19.188]  What did the government know about the possibility of terrorist attacks prior to 9-11?
[00:23:19.868 --> 00:23:23.470]  Is mainstream media telling you everything you should know about the war on terror?
[00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.011]  What is our real interest in Iraq and Saddam Hussein?
[00:23:27.111 --> 00:23:30.793]  Who stands to gain if we give up our freedoms in the name of national security?
[00:23:31.133 --> 00:23:34.175]  Who's behind the manipulation of our financial markets, and why?
[00:23:34.535 --> 00:23:35.196]  We're the jury.
[00:23:35.416 --> 00:23:36.196]  You be the judge.
[00:23:36.376 --> 00:23:37.957]  We're the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23:38.298 --> 00:23:40.739]  Are you tired of being lied to by mainstream media?
[00:23:40.939 --> 00:23:43.221]  Well, so are we, and we're doing something about it.

[00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:00.332]  We're the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:00.412 --> 00:24:01.273]  Check us out today.
[00:24:01.833 --> 00:24:03.775]  We promise not to tell anyone you were here.
[00:24:15.003 --> 00:24:16.905]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:17.405 --> 00:24:20.147]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:31.152 --> 00:24:31.972]  We're good to go.
[00:24:31.992 --> 00:24:32.152]  I think?
[00:24:54.315 --> 00:24:56.295]  This is our conservative.
[00:24:56.635 --> 00:25:17.719]  I mean, all the reason I'm talking about it is because it's become such a big distraction and diversion, and it's kind of a teaching aid because here's your modern neoconservative for homosexual marriage, for gun control, for abortion on demand, and that's what you get.
[00:25:17.879 --> 00:25:21.580]  Real conservatives like Representative...
[00:25:22.979 --> 00:25:34.729]  Iza and others go and get the recall petitions, and then Arnie swoops in, and Time Magazine, and just everybody is worshiping him.
[00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:37.912]  No mention of the Nazi dad, no nothing.
[00:25:38.492 --> 00:25:43.616]  And then there's Arnold's other bizarre statements about how he'd like to be the head of a national police force.
[00:25:43.937 --> 00:25:45.338]  He'd like Ridge's job.
[00:25:46.178 --> 00:25:47.059]  All this stuff.
[00:25:47.499 --> 00:25:51.523]  Oh, yeah, the foreigner wants to be over our national police.
[00:25:52.338 --> 00:25:53.158]  That's not funny.
[00:25:54.259 --> 00:25:57.201]  And we have John Shally Cash Vila.
[00:25:57.221 --> 00:26:02.984]  You know, he was the supreme commander of our forces under Lord Bush, under Lord Clinton.
[00:26:04.265 --> 00:26:05.845]  They have the chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:26:06.186 --> 00:26:06.906]  He's the chairman.
[00:26:07.847 --> 00:26:13.410]  And, you know, his daddy was the big head guy, the commissar in Poland.
[00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.571]  I mean, he really ran the death camps, folks.
[00:26:17.589 --> 00:26:19.629]  And so he was a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:26:19.649 --> 00:26:20.590]  You have Madeleine Albright.
[00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.030]  Her daddy was a commissar in Czechoslovakia.
[00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.191]  Killed at least over a million people.
[00:26:25.571 --> 00:26:26.471]  That's all admitted.
[00:26:28.111 --> 00:26:29.351]  Came up for confirmation.
[00:26:31.472 --> 00:26:32.852]  I mean, this is sick, folks.
[00:26:32.872 --> 00:26:45.795]  This is a real trend of all these foreigners and people with double citizenship for Israel, for Austria, for Mexico, coming up here
[00:26:46.898 --> 00:26:52.259]  Running for office, getting elected, and they could care less about America.
[00:26:54.639 --> 00:27:06.021]  But, I mean, when you've got somebody whose dad was an SS officer saying he wants to be the head of the National Police and he doesn't believe there's a Second Amendment, I mean, that was a big important litmus test for John Ashcroft, remember?
[00:27:07.162 --> 00:27:08.022]  Was he pro-gun?
[00:27:08.042 --> 00:27:08.762]  Of course he wasn't.
[00:27:08.802 --> 00:27:11.522]  He said, oh, I'm for the Second Amendment if prescribed by law.
[00:27:11.582 --> 00:27:13.283]  Well, the big law is the Second Amendment.
[00:27:13.623 --> 00:27:14.863]  Nothing can trump that.
[00:27:17.023 --> 00:27:17.824]  In man's law.
[00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:22.006]  He can make all the laws all day, saying, you know, we're not free human beings.
[00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:23.146]  Those are null and void.
[00:27:25.168 --> 00:27:26.528]  But that was an important litmus test.
[00:27:26.548 --> 00:27:27.329]  But not with Arnold.
[00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:30.911]  Oh, no, it's just pell-mell worship him.
[00:27:31.511 --> 00:27:33.072]  Oh, this is so much fun.
[00:27:34.693 --> 00:27:41.056]  We've got a sociopathic, well, he says he doesn't believe in God, but he's all about himself.
[00:27:41.096 --> 00:27:42.337]  That's what Anton LaVey said.
[00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.111]  In his satanic Bible.
[00:27:44.491 --> 00:27:47.513]  And it just so happens Arnie does attend the Grove.
[00:27:49.895 --> 00:27:50.956]  Does attend the Grove.
[00:27:51.596 --> 00:27:54.578]  Just type Arnold Schwarzenegger Bohemian Grove into a search engine.
[00:27:55.218 --> 00:27:56.800]  You'll get some nice mainstream articles.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.821]  I've been there, folks.
[00:28:00.042 --> 00:28:00.602]  I'm concerned.
[00:28:00.682 --> 00:28:08.608]  I wouldn't let somebody who worships a Canaanite deity in a black robe walk my dog or babysit my children.
[00:28:09.168 --> 00:28:10.449]  But we'll have him as a governor.
[00:28:11.424 --> 00:28:12.565]  Cliff in Colorado.
[00:28:12.585 --> 00:28:13.406]  Cliff, you're on the air.
[00:28:13.426 --> 00:28:13.846]  Go ahead.
[00:28:15.167 --> 00:28:17.348]  Alex, I really appreciate what you're doing.
[00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:21.451]  I have some suggestions for your listeners.
[00:28:22.572 --> 00:28:30.858]  I used to be real passionate about politics and proud that I voted and cared about what was going on politically.
[00:28:30.878 --> 00:28:35.841]  It took three things to wake me up and deprogram me.
[00:28:36.497 --> 00:28:41.258]  One was listening to your program, and not only that, but researching it and going to the computer and reading.
[00:28:41.278 --> 00:28:47.940]  A lot of people, I think, sit on the fence and listen to you and just go, yeah, yeah, I like what he says, but they don't research it.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.061]  And until they do and see it in black and white, they don't prove it.
[00:28:53.081 --> 00:28:53.441]  That's right.
[00:28:53.461 --> 00:28:55.522]  They decide to say, yeah, some of that's true.
[00:28:55.562 --> 00:28:57.162]  I've heard that, but he's exaggerating.
[00:28:57.442 --> 00:29:01.703]  They choose to not confirm it because if you confirm it, then you'll have to do something.
[00:29:02.608 --> 00:29:07.693]  Well, I've given out hundreds of your tapes, and 50% of the people are lethargic and don't care.
[00:29:08.894 --> 00:29:09.774]  They're just lethargic.
[00:29:09.854 --> 00:29:12.096]  They just don't even know.
[00:29:12.176 --> 00:29:13.938]  They watch it, and I said, did you watch it?
[00:29:13.958 --> 00:29:14.839]  And they said, yeah.
[00:29:15.099 --> 00:29:16.140]  They said, any comments?
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.863]  They just have a glazed look in their eye, and they don't have any comments.
[00:29:20.824 --> 00:29:25.068]  The second thing I do... They're not even in the ball game.
[00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.389]  That's true.
[00:29:26.409 --> 00:29:28.851]  They're a bunch of spectators, so I just feel sorry for them.
[00:29:28.871 --> 00:29:29.652]  They're like lemmings.
[00:29:30.802 --> 00:29:36.625]  What about the other 50% that listen?
[00:29:36.785 --> 00:29:37.906]  I'd say 25%, a quarter of the 50%.
[00:29:38.926 --> 00:29:40.647]  They care, they're passionate about it.
[00:29:40.667 --> 00:29:44.549]  We talk, we share videos, we swap videos, and we get involved.
[00:29:44.589 --> 00:29:48.371]  The other 25% are scared to death, and I think they're sitting on the fence.
[00:29:48.391 --> 00:29:49.432]  They don't know what to do.
[00:29:49.552 --> 00:29:53.334]  Well, hey, hey, 3% won the Revolutionary War.
[00:29:54.214 --> 00:29:55.515]  Stay there, I'll leave it to you.
[00:29:55.915 --> 00:29:57.576]  We've already got this thing won, folks.
[00:30:00.527 --> 00:30:01.430]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.911 --> 00:30:03.515]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.458 --> 00:30:07.165]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.237 --> 00:30:12.578]  I've lost 10 pounds with the collagen aid so far.
[00:30:12.798 --> 00:30:13.498]  Give it a try.
[00:30:13.698 --> 00:30:14.458]  Worked good for me.
[00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:18.020]  I'm going to have to go get re-measured because my pants are getting kind of baggy on me.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.640]  My stomach is not there no more.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.981]  It's really very easy.
[00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:23.781]  $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:23.841 --> 00:30:24.302]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:30:34.545 --> 00:30:40.567]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:30:41.187 --> 00:30:44.168]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:46.889 --> 00:30:48.390]  Folks, it really is pathetic.
[00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:55.592]  First it's Colby Bryant the last month, and then it shifts over into Arnold Schwarzenegger running for governor.
[00:30:58.153 --> 00:31:02.354]  And what's really sick is if they called him a liberal Democrat, a socialist...
[00:31:03.593 --> 00:31:13.523]  The National Socialist, I wouldn't have a problem with it because that would be honest, but calling him a Republican or a conservative is a joke, and it doesn't matter.
[00:31:13.603 --> 00:31:15.985]  I mean, it's a big, fat diversion.
[00:31:17.547 --> 00:31:24.154]  Again, the government has announced it's going to build three dozen Level 4 bioweapons labs.
[00:31:25.652 --> 00:31:26.253]  We're good to go.
[00:31:45.111 --> 00:32:03.637]  Past bioattacks and the engineering and the murder of scientists who developed this stuff to get rid of any evidence, and it's the government, the illegitimate government, run by a bunch of eugenics-promoting, Malthus-loving globalists.
[00:32:05.097 --> 00:32:06.558]  So we're going to have to talk more about this.
[00:32:06.778 --> 00:32:08.078]  I mean, it's frightening.
[00:32:09.538 --> 00:32:14.300]  I was over at a friend's house last night, and we're talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger running for governor.
[00:32:15.296 --> 00:32:18.058]  And he said, you know, the New World Order just loves Hitler.
[00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:20.699]  And it's true.
[00:32:20.739 --> 00:32:22.460]  I mean, they love the black uniforms.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.623]  They love the Homeland Security, Reichland Security, Reich means land.
[00:32:27.163 --> 00:32:28.023]  Same terms.
[00:32:28.824 --> 00:32:33.406]  Hitler's symbol was a bundle of sticks with an axe head on the top, the fascia.
[00:32:34.267 --> 00:32:41.231]  After 1945, they put that in the Capitol building with a flag hanging straight down as a sign of distress.
[00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:42.772]  That's all new, folks.
[00:32:43.824 --> 00:32:45.646]  The Eagles with the pointed scepter.
[00:32:46.447 --> 00:32:48.028]  I mean, it's all Nazi stuff.
[00:32:48.108 --> 00:32:55.034]  Prescott Bush actually arrested in 1942 for sitting on the board with top Nazis.
[00:32:55.094 --> 00:32:59.518]  He was the only American on the board running all of it.
[00:33:00.298 --> 00:33:01.820]  It's just incredible.
[00:33:03.301 --> 00:33:06.424]  The Kennedys, the Joseph Kennedy...
[00:33:07.606 --> 00:33:15.574]  Was ambassador to England, had dinner with Hitler, good friends, loved each other, told America that we should work with Hitler.
[00:33:16.315 --> 00:33:18.037]  He had to be recalled after that happened.
[00:33:18.938 --> 00:33:26.125]  So the New World Order set Hitler up, used Hitler to then even expand their power more, then create a crisis, pull the rug out from under him,
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:40.266]  And then you use that same elite, the Trumps, the Dutch, the British, others, to now set that up again in the future, using America this time as the unstoppable engine of the Fourth Reich.
[00:33:42.507 --> 00:33:49.690]  And then you shake your head and you go, well, then why do the neocons then have all these Jews up in the top of it?
[00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:54.192]  I mean, you've got all these Nazis promoting Nazi ideas and Ron Pauls.
[00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.090]  Vietnam veteran, most conservative member of Congress.
[00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.131]  He gave that 45-minute speech.
[00:33:59.171 --> 00:34:00.091]  We read it here on air.
[00:34:00.131 --> 00:34:04.472]  It's still posted on the right-hand side of the main page of Infowars.com.
[00:34:04.872 --> 00:34:05.772]  Picture of Ron Paul.
[00:34:05.812 --> 00:34:06.412]  Just scroll down.
[00:34:06.432 --> 00:34:07.132]  Do you see his picture?
[00:34:08.892 --> 00:34:09.693]  He pointed this out.
[00:34:09.753 --> 00:34:17.334]  He said that they support Machiavelli, who believe in lying and manipulating and entering into evil and lying to the public.
[00:34:18.774 --> 00:34:21.174]  He talked about how the neocons support Trotsky.
[00:34:22.255 --> 00:34:23.975]  He talked about how the neocons...
[00:34:25.385 --> 00:34:27.367]  Support all these other evil people.
[00:34:27.387 --> 00:34:29.488]  The neocons have promoted, the Brotherhood has.
[00:34:29.508 --> 00:34:31.109]  That was in Harper's Magazine.
[00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:32.550]  They believe in Hitler.
[00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:40.134]  They believe, folks, basically whether they're German or Chinese or Mexican or, you know, it doesn't matter.
[00:34:40.194 --> 00:34:41.495]  They're evil people.
[00:34:42.115 --> 00:34:50.180]  And as Paul Joseph Watson said yesterday, it doesn't matter if they're German or Jewish or African, you know, it doesn't matter.
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.521]  They're evil people.
[00:34:52.242 --> 00:35:01.146]  And they're adopting every evil system in history and making this amalgam that is the New World Order.
[00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:08.689]  Cliff in Colorado talked about how half of those that watch Road to Tyranny or my other videos don't even have a comment.
[00:35:08.709 --> 00:35:09.829]  They're so mind-numbed.
[00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:17.092]  But how 25% of those that see it are awake or involved or fighting back.
[00:35:17.152 --> 00:35:17.812]  The other 25% are afraid.
[00:35:19.716 --> 00:35:23.137]  Now, the national average is about 90% wake up and are concerned.
[00:35:23.217 --> 00:35:26.158]  But, yeah, a percentage of those are wanting to take action.
[00:35:26.198 --> 00:35:27.118]  The others are afraid.
[00:35:28.538 --> 00:35:32.580]  Some areas you hear of like 10% waking up, the others being brain dead.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.340]  He's saying he gets 50-50.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:43.343]  But that's exciting, Cliff, that 25% of those, you say you've given out hundreds of copies, are waking up.
[00:35:43.383 --> 00:35:44.103]  What are they saying?
[00:35:46.343 --> 00:35:47.604]  Well, the ones that...
[00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:56.523]  The ones that watch and believe and research are pretty passionate about it, and we're trying to do the best we can.
[00:35:56.543 --> 00:36:07.931]  I go to public libraries and request that they look into your website and request your documentaries and films.
[00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:17.459]  I mail copies to people that write letters to the paper praising Bush or
[00:36:18.001 --> 00:36:18.602]  We're good to go.
[00:36:18.622 --> 00:36:19.262]  We're good to go.
[00:36:44.229 --> 00:36:48.434]  Presenting videos free to the public and talk about these things on a weekly basis.
[00:36:48.454 --> 00:36:51.638]  Well, you should start another coffee shop, but let me break this down for folks.
[00:36:53.199 --> 00:37:05.113]  Hitler, while we're talking about Hitler and his spawn, Hitler took the German flag more than the Nazi flag and used it to say, I am the government.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.021]  One people, one land, one leader to fight the terrorists, he said.
[00:37:20.979 --> 00:37:23.981]  He said, you must not question me or you're not patriotic.
[00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:32.107]  And, I mean, now I pulled into, what, a Sitco or something, and they have a big sign now on the side, not just a flag, but a sign of the American flag.
[00:37:32.147 --> 00:37:38.291]  And you watch Home Depot commercials, and a woman walks over to help somebody and has the American flag on her shirt.
[00:37:39.391 --> 00:37:40.092]  You know, it's everywhere.
[00:37:40.132 --> 00:37:41.833]  It's saying, hey, I'm with the empire.
[00:37:42.213 --> 00:37:47.377]  They're expropriating, taking our symbol, affixing it to their uniforms.
[00:37:48.354 --> 00:37:51.716]  And saying, if you don't support everything we say, you're against America.
[00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:52.997]  You're either for us or against us.
[00:37:53.037 --> 00:38:00.721]  Now, everything that flag symbolizes is being destroyed at the same time.
[00:38:00.761 --> 00:38:09.386]  And I remember five years ago, the police manuals, the news, Hollywood, the movies, you were a weirdo if you flew the American flag.
[00:38:09.767 --> 00:38:13.649]  Police manuals said, watch out for cars with a bunch of American flags.
[00:38:14.029 --> 00:38:15.190]  That was our symbol.
[00:38:16.081 --> 00:38:16.621]  We're good to go.
[00:38:33.709 --> 00:38:41.052]  They've expropriated it, and it's very important how they twist symbols and turn them around.
[00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:49.455]  And now the flag's been turned into an armband for the New World Order, when in truth the New World Order is destroying the spirit of the flag.
[00:38:49.475 --> 00:38:49.875]  Go ahead.
[00:38:51.156 --> 00:38:53.897]  Well, it's just, for me it was a turning point.
[00:38:53.917 --> 00:38:57.158]  There was three things that really helped deprogram me.
[00:38:57.558 --> 00:38:59.339]  And the one, of course, has been listening to you.
[00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:00.039]  The second one,
[00:39:00.469 --> 00:39:03.772]  You don't have the scientific Atlantic cable box with the microphone admittedly in it?
[00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:29.572]  And I encourage anybody to give it up for a month or so.
[00:39:30.172 --> 00:39:32.173]  It's a problem for me, and we're about to go to our calls.
[00:39:32.213 --> 00:39:33.193]  I really appreciate your call.
[00:39:33.713 --> 00:39:34.513]  God bless you, sir.
[00:39:34.553 --> 00:39:35.013]  Keep it up.
[00:39:35.514 --> 00:39:35.854]  Thank you.
[00:39:36.114 --> 00:39:36.474]  You bet.
[00:39:36.794 --> 00:39:44.137]  It's a problem for me because I need to watch the news, the television.
[00:39:45.837 --> 00:39:48.878]  I need to track and trace what they're doing and look at the propaganda.
[00:39:48.918 --> 00:39:50.239]  And I still go to some movies.
[00:39:50.439 --> 00:39:52.339]  I watch videos.
[00:39:52.399 --> 00:39:54.340]  Listeners send me a specific stuff.
[00:39:55.094 --> 00:39:55.514]  We're good to go.
[00:40:22.598 --> 00:40:26.381]  And now, it's good to the point where I can't watch it.
[00:40:27.541 --> 00:40:29.122]  I mean, it was becoming that upsetting.
[00:40:29.623 --> 00:40:39.109]  We talked about the Frazier episode where he joins the gun club and his family, his friends all criticize him and what's wrong with him.
[00:40:39.149 --> 00:40:39.889]  This is crazy.
[00:40:39.929 --> 00:40:40.590]  This is evil.
[00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.091]  It's not bad.
[00:40:42.111 --> 00:40:43.972]  He could do anything else, but this was bad.
[00:40:45.587 --> 00:40:50.892]  And then at the end he goes into the basement and there's the gun club huddled around something whispering.
[00:40:50.912 --> 00:40:51.773]  He says, what's that?
[00:40:51.833 --> 00:40:53.875]  They don't show what it is, but they say, oh, it's...
[00:40:56.036 --> 00:40:56.497]  We're good to go.
[00:40:56.577 --> 00:40:56.837]  I think?
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.143]  And, you know, anybody that's into guns and talks about a new world order is dangerous.
[00:41:25.623 --> 00:41:26.984]  You better run screaming from them.
[00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:29.986]  I mean, I couldn't watch a movie.
[00:41:30.646 --> 00:41:32.047]  I couldn't watch a commercial.
[00:41:32.187 --> 00:41:33.548]  I couldn't flip channels.
[00:41:33.628 --> 00:41:35.369]  It's just wall-to-wall evil.
[00:41:35.509 --> 00:41:37.090]  I can't handle it anymore, folks.
[00:41:39.492 --> 00:41:49.558]  And so now every newspaper I pick up, it's that leering, narcissistic face who's for abortion, against guns,
[00:41:51.705 --> 00:42:08.337]  For same-sex marriage, telling me in his own book that he's God and he doesn't like Jesus Christ, and he's a member of the Bohemian Grove, and I've got to watch all the smacking, smiling neocons.
[00:42:09.478 --> 00:42:17.804]  I've watched just a few hours the last four weeks, and it's always, Arnold, Arnold, Arnold, you know, the Sean Hannity's of the world.
[00:42:18.164 --> 00:42:20.246]  Well, he's a liberal, but that's okay.
[00:42:22.248 --> 00:42:23.028]  It's hollow.
[00:42:23.688 --> 00:42:24.729]  Dick in Colorado.
[00:42:24.769 --> 00:42:25.489]  Dick, go ahead.
[00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:26.689]  Hey, Alex.
[00:42:26.969 --> 00:42:27.449]  Yes, sir.
[00:42:28.149 --> 00:42:36.311]  I sent you an email a few days ago asking your permission regarding making 100 copies of a couple of your videos.
[00:42:36.371 --> 00:42:39.592]  That is 50 each, and I haven't heard back, so I decided to call you.
[00:42:39.612 --> 00:42:48.413]  Well, I've said on the air 500 times that if somebody makes copies of my films to give out free, not for sale, then I want you to do it.
[00:42:48.713 --> 00:42:50.374]  Yeah, but here's the caveat.
[00:42:52.769 --> 00:42:57.053]  And the reason for my question, it's going to cost us about five bucks a copy to make these.
[00:42:58.174 --> 00:43:04.699]  And somebody suggested that we see if we can sell them for five bucks a copy.
[00:43:04.719 --> 00:43:05.440]  I can't do that.
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.102]  I'm barely able to maintain my operation.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:30.326 --> 00:43:36.549]  I mean, it's a donation to the country to buy the films from me and then to make the copies of them.
[00:43:36.889 --> 00:43:41.731]  If I start letting people make copies and sell them, I won't be here.
[00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:43.151]  There won't be any more films.
[00:43:43.412 --> 00:43:55.236]  Okay, well, see, my question was that you had said not-for-profit, and so I was wondering, if we sell them for what it cost us, is that contrary to the spirit?
[00:43:55.256 --> 00:43:57.037]  So you need this for a store or something?
[00:43:57.057 --> 00:43:58.338]  You need this on tape or what?
[00:43:58.718 --> 00:43:58.978]  Pardon?
[00:44:00.386 --> 00:44:02.949]  So you need a letter so you can go sell these someplace, or what's going on?
[00:44:03.009 --> 00:44:17.366]  Well, I don't... Well, if it costs us five bucks apiece... I've told folks if they want to do this, I'll give people 50% off if they want to buy them in bulk.
[00:44:18.546 --> 00:44:20.527]  And then you've got the original, high quality.
[00:44:20.808 --> 00:44:24.350]  You know, did you know every day I get videos back that aren't even mine?
[00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:30.013]  People demanding, I send them a replacement, and then I call them and I go, who'd you buy this from?
[00:44:30.053 --> 00:44:35.917]  It'll be some big Christian ministry who's selling my tapes as if they're for me.
[00:44:36.897 --> 00:44:37.758]  Are they making a profit?
[00:44:37.798 --> 00:44:38.578]  I cannot do it.
[00:44:38.758 --> 00:44:39.579]  I cannot do it.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.623]  Every day we have to call people back and say, you were sold a bootleg.
[00:44:47.124 --> 00:44:47.764]  Did you know that?
[00:44:48.818 --> 00:44:55.603]  No, so I gather what you're saying is that if we sell them for what it costs us to make them, that is not okay.
[00:44:56.043 --> 00:44:58.124]  No, it's not, because people take advantage of that.
[00:44:58.164 --> 00:44:59.285]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[00:44:59.305 --> 00:45:02.187]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I'm not offended a bit.
[00:45:03.268 --> 00:45:08.091]  I'm really impressed by what you're doing, and I'm so darn glad you're there.
[00:45:08.111 --> 00:45:10.592]  Well, no, I mean, listen, I want to thank you for your support.
[00:45:10.632 --> 00:45:14.395]  I understand it's hard to make a couple hundred copies of this, but, you know, just...
[00:45:15.051 --> 00:45:15.891]  I mean, do what I do.
[00:45:16.091 --> 00:45:17.412]  You know, stop eating fast food.
[00:45:17.812 --> 00:45:20.492]  Stop eating that trash and stop supporting those people.
[00:45:20.553 --> 00:45:25.814]  And the money you'll save off of making a sack lunch, you can make three copies of the video a day.
[00:45:27.374 --> 00:45:27.794]  You will.
[00:45:28.835 --> 00:45:31.095]  Okay, so... I mean, that right there.
[00:45:31.275 --> 00:45:37.917]  Look, for $2 a day, you can make a copy in the morning and a copy at night and have two copies of the video a day.
[00:45:38.617 --> 00:45:42.999]  Two copies of any of the videos a day as a repeat of 1776...
[00:45:45.089 --> 00:45:48.890]  To the mini printing press.
[00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:50.391]  Two copies a day.
[00:45:50.451 --> 00:45:53.231]  And then when you give them to folks, tell them you make two copies.
[00:45:54.312 --> 00:45:55.412]  It'll have a huge effect.
[00:45:55.752 --> 00:45:56.692]  Okay, one more question.
[00:45:56.752 --> 00:45:58.373]  I've got to let you get on to other people.
[00:46:00.373 --> 00:46:04.975]  If we were to choose two, would you have a preference of the nine?
[00:46:05.075 --> 00:46:07.615]  I have all nine of yours personally.
[00:46:08.336 --> 00:46:12.877]  If we were to choose to copy two of them, which would be your choice?
[00:46:14.286 --> 00:46:20.670]  Probably 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, and... 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:24.712]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, or Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:46:24.932 --> 00:46:26.513]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:46:27.114 --> 00:46:27.614]  Okay, Alex.
[00:46:28.094 --> 00:46:28.975]  Hey, thanks a lot.
[00:46:29.395 --> 00:46:31.236]  Keep up the... Go ahead.
[00:46:31.496 --> 00:46:32.497]  It's tremendous.
[00:46:33.097 --> 00:46:33.677]  Well, thank you.
[00:46:33.737 --> 00:46:37.640]  So you're seeing an effect giving people the videos.
[00:46:39.901 --> 00:46:40.521]  Well, that's great.
[00:46:41.974 --> 00:46:44.015]  Again, I'm not mad at Cliff or Dick.
[00:46:44.055 --> 00:46:48.856]  You guys are great, but I don't want to talk about my videos all day long.
[00:46:48.916 --> 00:46:50.136]  No, they are having an effect.
[00:46:50.876 --> 00:46:52.877]  Maybe somebody wants to comment about Arno.
[00:46:53.357 --> 00:46:53.797]  Arno!
[00:46:54.597 --> 00:46:59.078]  Because, you know, it's a very important diversion, so we've got to respond to the diversion.
[00:46:59.458 --> 00:47:01.099]  Howard in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:47:01.139 --> 00:47:01.579]  Go ahead.
[00:47:02.599 --> 00:47:02.899]  Alex?
[00:47:03.439 --> 00:47:03.679]  Yes.
[00:47:03.819 --> 00:47:06.080]  Alex, there was a movie.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.840]  This is when you were little, Alex.
[00:47:08.541 --> 00:47:08.881]  Around 1985...
[00:47:11.056 --> 00:47:18.759]  84, 85.
[00:47:11.256 --> 00:47:18.759]  One of the networks put out a miniseries, and I think it was called Heartland.
[00:47:20.519 --> 00:47:22.880]  And it wasn't Red Dawn.
[00:47:24.221 --> 00:47:25.681]  It was worse than Red Dawn.
[00:47:25.701 --> 00:47:27.122]  It was called America.
[00:47:27.782 --> 00:47:29.282]  Maybe that's what it was called.
[00:47:29.302 --> 00:47:30.643]  With a K, with Chris Kristofferson.
[00:47:31.623 --> 00:47:34.584]  And they were just taking over the United States.
[00:47:34.704 --> 00:47:35.224]  They had, like...
[00:47:38.346 --> 00:47:41.147]  Yeah, there's a terrorist attack.
[00:47:41.187 --> 00:47:44.488]  There's a puppet government that says the foreign troops are here to save us.
[00:47:44.948 --> 00:47:46.869]  And that was produced by the Rhodes Scholars.
[00:47:47.269 --> 00:47:48.869]  That's what they're going to do to us.
[00:47:49.489 --> 00:47:50.110]  That's right.
[00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:52.490]  They like to tell you what the plan is.
[00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:54.831]  And I said, you know, that's the plan.
[00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:57.112]  I remember that movie.
[00:47:57.132 --> 00:48:01.833]  I said, this is just like that movie that I saw when I was in college.
[00:48:01.973 --> 00:48:03.914]  I said, this miniseries.
[00:48:04.034 --> 00:48:04.814]  I said, it's like...
[00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:07.251]  You're just going right down the line.
[00:48:07.912 --> 00:48:13.257]  Hey, Alex, what I thought about it, here was a guy I had first kissed.
[00:48:13.297 --> 00:48:13.678]  Stay there.
[00:48:13.718 --> 00:48:15.259]  I'll let you finish up, Howard, on the other side.
[00:48:15.279 --> 00:48:18.402]  Then we'll go to Sean and Kelly and others.
[00:48:18.643 --> 00:48:20.124]  And we do have some guests coming in as well.
[00:48:20.184 --> 00:48:21.866]  And a bunch of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:48:21.906 --> 00:48:26.331]  But, hey, who cares about them building level four bioweapons lab in your neighborhood?
[00:48:27.432 --> 00:48:28.373]  We'll talk about Arnold.
[00:48:31.787 --> 00:48:34.368]  Hardly a day goes by in the garden without the Cobra Head.
[00:48:34.528 --> 00:48:37.409]  I want to tell you about a great little garden tool called the Cobra Head.
[00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:43.431]  First, take half of the tools you're currently using in the garden, throw them away, and call 1-866-YO-COBRA.
[00:48:43.611 --> 00:48:45.832]  The Cobra Head is like having a steel fingernail.
[00:48:45.992 --> 00:48:51.934]  This tool plants, scalps, cultivates, transplants, dethatches, harvests, furrows, digs, you name it.
[00:48:52.054 --> 00:48:53.234]  The Cobra Head can do it.
[00:48:53.494 --> 00:48:58.916]  With the Cobra Head, I can make quick work out of weeding my garden beds, especially between the garden rows where space is tight.
[00:48:59.296 --> 00:49:01.699]  I love to spend time in the garden as any gardener does.
[00:49:01.919 --> 00:49:04.221]  But now my time in the garden is a lot more productive.
[00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:10.807]  The Cobra Head handheld multi-purpose garden tool has certainly earned my personal stamp of approval and I'd recommend it to anyone.
[00:49:10.987 --> 00:49:12.349]  But don't take my word for it.
[00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:19.696]  The Cobra Head just received the recommendation and seal of approval from the National Home Gardening Club after being tested by 200 members.
[00:49:20.156 --> 00:49:21.117]  Don't wait another minute.
[00:49:21.537 --> 00:49:22.999]  Call toll-free 1-866-YO-COBRA.
[00:49:23.019 --> 00:49:25.302]  That's 1-866-962-6272 or visit CobraHead.com.
[00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:35.092]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:38.873]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:49:38.953 --> 00:49:42.895]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:49:43.115 --> 00:49:49.278]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:49.678 --> 00:49:57.602]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:49:58.002 --> 00:50:03.366]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:50:03.506 --> 00:50:07.288]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:50:07.648 --> 00:50:09.530]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:11.751]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:50:11.971 --> 00:50:16.574]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:50:16.614 --> 00:50:22.698]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.741]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:50:30.321 --> 00:50:34.643]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:34.823 --> 00:50:39.244]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:39.384 --> 00:50:43.765]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:43.805 --> 00:50:45.166]  The New World Order.
[00:50:45.854 --> 00:50:47.336]  You will lose your liberty
[00:51:01.534 --> 00:51:11.119]  The new prison economy, the total information society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:11.299 --> 00:51:16.682]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:51:17.182 --> 00:51:19.863]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:20.584]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:20.604 --> 00:51:20.944]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:20.964 --> 00:51:22.224]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:51:39.424 --> 00:51:43.606]  Alright, I do have a bunch of news we haven't even gotten to yet, but hey, we're not going to talk about it.
[00:51:43.626 --> 00:51:48.327]  We're going to talk about Arnold all day and how important that is.
[00:51:49.768 --> 00:51:52.629]  Well, the story of how it's a big diversion is important.
[00:51:53.369 --> 00:51:57.250]  You notice my great listeners are not deprogrammed by the globalists.
[00:51:59.091 --> 00:52:04.033]  That's right, they are programmed to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and they're not being programmed.
[00:52:04.093 --> 00:52:05.853]  Boy, that's some double speak or double think.
[00:52:06.834 --> 00:52:08.154]  But it all depends on how you look at it.
[00:52:09.494 --> 00:52:11.875]  My listeners don't care about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:52:12.275 --> 00:52:13.475]  They're not talking about him.
[00:52:14.075 --> 00:52:15.835]  They're not talking about Colby Bryant.
[00:52:16.335 --> 00:52:17.716]  They're not talking about O.J.
[00:52:17.776 --> 00:52:20.596]  or Monica Lewinsky or any of these diversions.
[00:52:23.837 --> 00:52:24.337]  I forget it.
[00:52:24.417 --> 00:52:31.118]  We were talking to Howard in Texas, and he wanted to talk about Erskine, who has a great show Saturday night and a Sunday morning on this network.
[00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:33.819]  Who did Erskine have on?
[00:52:35.982 --> 00:52:37.847]  I think you may have to look this up.
[00:52:37.907 --> 00:52:38.529]  Gunnarsson?
[00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:39.932]  Maybe it's the wrong name.
[00:52:40.293 --> 00:52:41.275]  Yeah, Chuck Gunnarsson?
[00:52:41.837 --> 00:52:43.421]  It's about bell towers.
[00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:49.831]  And he explained about what you were talking about, the cell towers and mind control, how that works.
[00:52:50.171 --> 00:52:58.116]  Well, that was the Boston Globe last week, that DARPA has these frequency generators, and they want to put them up to make us happy.
[00:52:58.196 --> 00:53:09.303]  And, you know, half the ads on the nightly news are for Prozac, so you know we need to take our Soma, and they do have frequency generators, and they do want to, it's said, not just...
[00:53:10.303 --> 00:53:12.885]  Not just scan our minds, but control them.
[00:53:13.085 --> 00:53:15.467]  Doesn't that sound like freedom to you?
[00:53:15.967 --> 00:53:20.230]  And he talked about somebody getting a binoculars.
[00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:26.994]  He says, you go up and get binoculars and go look at the cables going up to the microwave transmitters.
[00:53:27.615 --> 00:53:32.438]  And he said they're like three-quarters to an inch thick to each transmitter.
[00:53:32.498 --> 00:53:38.782]  And he said the cables are capable of generating thousands of watts.
[00:53:39.884 --> 00:53:41.845]  And he says, you don't need that for cell phones.
[00:53:43.246 --> 00:53:46.248]  Now, what's the individual's name you're talking about?
[00:53:46.688 --> 00:53:48.509]  I think it was Gunnarsson.
[00:53:48.529 --> 00:53:51.711]  You may have to go to Erskine's website and find out what the guy's name is.
[00:53:51.771 --> 00:53:55.333]  Well, I mean, I don't go off generally what some guy says.
[00:53:55.353 --> 00:53:59.335]  I just go off the Boston Globe, DARPA saying we want to put mine.
[00:53:59.355 --> 00:54:05.819]  No, no, he knows the technical part of the towers.
[00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:07.931]  This is what he was saying.
[00:54:07.951 --> 00:54:09.751]  I'll have to get him on then.
[00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:16.954]  He said because you can talk to somebody who knows about frequencies and power or just cell phones.
[00:54:17.635 --> 00:54:21.957]  But what's been installed is for something to put out a lot.
[00:54:22.837 --> 00:54:29.840]  Yeah, but what I'm telling you though is, Howard, is they admit they're going to put mind control devices in.
[00:54:31.158 --> 00:54:32.179]  So it's now admitted.
[00:54:32.459 --> 00:54:36.541]  It's like people still email me and call me and go, where's the proof of the camps?
[00:54:36.881 --> 00:54:37.681]  Where are the camps?
[00:54:37.761 --> 00:54:43.644]  And I go, well, do you want the Rocky Mountain News or MSNBC or LA Times or Associated Press?
[00:54:43.664 --> 00:54:44.585]  And it's all posted.
[00:54:45.425 --> 00:54:46.826]  But, yeah, that sounds interesting.
[00:54:46.866 --> 00:54:47.686]  I'll have to get him on.
[00:54:47.746 --> 00:54:48.287]  Thanks, Howard.
[00:54:48.567 --> 00:54:48.927]  All righty.
[00:54:49.207 --> 00:54:49.808]  Thanks a million.
[00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:54.410]  We're going to come back and talk to Shane and Kelly and Alan and Elaine and others.
[00:54:55.891 --> 00:55:03.877]  Before I end this hour, there's been a lot of talk in my videos, and that's how you support us, and I've written a book, and Paul Joseph Watton's written Order Out of Chaos.
[00:55:04.117 --> 00:55:05.118]  We just published it.
[00:55:05.158 --> 00:55:05.718]  We printed it.
[00:55:07.059 --> 00:55:11.763]  Elite Sponsored Terrorism in the New World Order, and it's $19.95.
[00:55:11.863 --> 00:55:14.005]  My book's $12, covers September 11th.
[00:55:15.446 --> 00:55:19.068]  The films are Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 2000,
[00:55:20.822 --> 00:55:22.803]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:55:22.843 --> 00:55:24.084]  I've made nine films.
[00:55:24.104 --> 00:55:25.565]  They're $25.95 apiece.
[00:55:25.985 --> 00:55:26.846]  Order three or more.
[00:55:26.886 --> 00:55:27.586]  They drop down to $20.
[00:55:27.666 --> 00:55:32.349]  The toll-free number to order my videos is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:32.369 --> 00:55:33.350]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:51.027]  Or Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:52.749]  Please don't wait, folks.
[00:55:53.289 --> 00:55:54.990]  Paul, get the videos, get the new book.
[00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.811]  888-253-3139.
[00:55:55.831 --> 00:56:00.594]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-0409.
[00:56:13.692 --> 00:56:19.313]  They'll be back with the second hour of your calls and the news, and we've got some surprise guests as well.
[00:56:21.514 --> 00:56:27.695]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:56:28.395 --> 00:56:39.538]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.147 --> 00:56:47.787]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.448 --> 00:56:49.489]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.209 --> 00:56:51.330]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:52.792]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.552 --> 00:56:54.453]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.473 --> 00:56:58.897]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.297 --> 00:57:03.421]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:04.902 --> 00:57:12.029]  Oh, I can't think of anything more interesting or more thought-provoking or informative than listeners calling into the show.
[00:57:13.212 --> 00:57:14.012]  And it's Tuesday.
[00:57:14.052 --> 00:57:14.993]  We've got open lines.
[00:57:15.073 --> 00:57:24.217]  And Dr. Paul Revere, that's his real name, coming up to talk about, well, how the Christian church is manipulated.
[00:57:25.522 --> 00:57:34.609]  By Romans 13, it says lay down to the government and how they've changed the new Bibles to say world government is good, submit to Satan, he loves you.
[00:57:34.629 --> 00:57:37.210]  I mean, it's not that bad, but it almost is.
[00:57:37.971 --> 00:57:45.196]  And even if you're not a Christian out there, you need to understand the dynamics of how the government is controlling the Christian church in America.
[00:57:45.236 --> 00:57:46.377]  So that's in about 30 minutes.
[00:57:47.017 --> 00:57:54.883]  We're going to be joined by some other folks as well just to examine why the church in America worships world government
[00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:55.765]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:55.845 --> 00:57:56.026]  Hello.
[00:58:23.397 --> 00:58:38.112]  Well, first of all, before I get going, speaking as a former slave to the gods of science and drugs, who was set free by the grace of Jesus Christ, I just want to encourage you to keep running the race and fighting the good fight of faith.
[00:58:41.115 --> 00:58:45.980]  But as far as Schwarzenegger goes, he's just the distraction du jour.
[00:58:46.846 --> 00:58:48.207]  He's already been handpicked.
[00:58:48.267 --> 00:58:52.930]  I mean, you know this, when the Democrats, not even a week into the race, are apologizing to him.
[00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:57.252]  Yeah, it's totally staged.
[00:58:57.272 --> 00:59:07.859]  I mean, when Time Magazine and Newsweek are an absolute worship fest, saying he's the new Ronald Reagan, it's got presidential run all over it.
[00:59:08.739 --> 00:59:09.019]  Oh, yeah.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.541]  And by the way, they got the ComCon.
[00:59:11.961 --> 00:59:16.264]  The CFR has called for the ComCon to rewrite the whole Bill of Rights.
[00:59:17.097 --> 00:59:19.220]  So that's coming up, Constitutional Convention.
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:22.746]  So Arnold, Arnold's got what it takes.
[00:59:23.513 --> 00:59:25.935]  Well, you know, of course they want to rewrite the Constitution.
[00:59:26.035 --> 00:59:33.161]  After all, it was written by a bunch of knuckle-dragging, you know, quick cave dwellers that lived so long ago they couldn't have foreseen the real world today.
[00:59:33.261 --> 00:59:33.942]  I understand.
[00:59:34.222 --> 00:59:37.785]  About eight presidents have come out of the Grove in the last 50 years.
[00:59:38.225 --> 00:59:40.147]  Oh, I certainly believe that.
[00:59:40.267 --> 00:59:48.094]  So, Arnold, Arnold, it said three weeks ago he had already been chosen by Bohemian Grove.
[00:59:48.474 --> 00:59:48.834]  Oh, yeah.
[00:59:49.515 --> 00:59:51.697]  But on to the real reason I'm calling today.
[00:59:53.022 --> 00:59:56.123]  First of all, real quick about the RFID.
[00:59:58.483 --> 00:59:58.763]  Yes.
[00:59:59.303 --> 01:00:07.085]  Currently, the way these things are being put forth is that they're not self-powered, that they have to receive a pulse from a scanner.
[01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:17.567]  But I was reading an article about a week or so ago that Japanese scientists have now found a way to power bioimplants off of the glucose in your blood sugar.
[01:00:18.297 --> 01:00:20.358]  Well, that's how it worked all along.
[01:00:20.378 --> 01:00:26.380]  The Vera chip or digital angel works off of muscle bragging across it.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:30.422]  That's why it's implanted in muscle and off the heat generated.
[01:00:30.482 --> 01:00:32.623]  I mean, there's massive heat in the human body.
[01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:33.323]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:34.024 --> 01:00:36.044]  I mean, just ask the machines in the Matrix.
[01:00:37.065 --> 01:00:37.245]  Yeah.
[01:00:37.405 --> 01:00:40.806]  Well, now they don't even need the galvanic response from the muscles.
[01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:43.087]  They just power it straight off the glucose in your blood.
[01:00:43.548 --> 01:00:44.268]  But that doesn't...
[01:00:44.833 --> 01:00:48.054]  That does not matter.
[01:00:48.074 --> 01:00:59.259]  And also, I came across a really interesting article in the Washington Post, just further trashing the Fifth Amendment.
[01:00:59.359 --> 01:01:02.540]  The American Bar Association voted...
[01:01:04.011 --> 01:01:13.294]  That it's now okay for attorneys to snitch out their clients to the government if they come across evidence that their clients did anything wrong.
[01:01:13.714 --> 01:01:14.174]  Exactly.
[01:01:14.214 --> 01:01:15.395]  That's an important tidbit.
[01:01:15.415 --> 01:01:16.695]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[01:01:16.735 --> 01:01:19.536]  The American Bar two years ago called for getting rid of juries.
[01:01:20.516 --> 01:01:25.418]  Oh, yeah, you know, we can't have people being tried by their peers, you know.
[01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:26.839]  We've got to have the kangaroo court.
[01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:28.059]  I'm glad you mentioned it.
[01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:37.143]  That's what's in my stack of news here, that you're now, for any crime, having your attorney work for the government and tattle on you.
[01:01:37.844 --> 01:01:39.264]  Your psychiatrists, too, they want to do that.
[01:01:39.985 --> 01:01:40.505]  It's wonderful.
[01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:50.921]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:01:51.161 --> 01:01:55.523]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:01:55.803 --> 01:02:04.727]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:02:04.927 --> 01:02:08.549]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:13.873]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:02:14.173 --> 01:02:20.858]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:02:21.371 --> 01:02:22.031]  What about you?
[01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:28.015]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:29.176]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:02:29.256 --> 01:02:31.157]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:02:42.961 --> 01:02:50.347]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:50.627 --> 01:02:55.351]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.591 --> 01:03:01.236]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.476 --> 01:03:02.336]  We're good to go.
[01:03:17.782 --> 01:03:18.863]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:03:18.903 --> 01:03:19.103]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:42.691]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[01:03:42.911 --> 01:03:45.232]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[01:03:45.352 --> 01:03:46.052]  You heard that right.
[01:03:46.132 --> 01:03:48.614]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[01:03:48.754 --> 01:03:49.694]  You don't have to pay them off.
[01:03:49.954 --> 01:03:51.255]  The banks are defrauding you.
[01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:53.056]  Now is the time to fight back.
[01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:56.057]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[01:03:56.237 --> 01:03:57.138]  The procedure's easy.
[01:03:57.378 --> 01:03:58.599]  Don't let the banksters cheat you.
[01:03:58.639 --> 01:03:59.460]  Fight back, America.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:03:59.920]  Stop the fraud.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:00.821]  Stop the rip-off.
[01:04:00.841 --> 01:04:01.462]  Learn the truth.
[01:04:25.402 --> 01:04:28.623]  1-2-3-NoDebt.com.
[01:04:28.723 --> 01:04:32.944]  Come over and get our rock-solid technology that waves out debt without bankruptcy.
[01:04:32.964 --> 01:04:36.065]  1-2-3-NoDebt.com.
[01:04:36.425 --> 01:04:37.405]  Live debt-free now.
[01:04:37.785 --> 01:04:39.526]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[01:04:42.447 --> 01:04:47.488]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:47.848 --> 01:04:50.129]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:04:53.055 --> 01:05:11.329]  For those that just joined us, a caller in the last segment mentioned that the American Bar Association just voted last week to strike down the attorney-client privilege.
[01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:13.931]  Notice they always called it a privilege.
[01:05:15.492 --> 01:05:19.115]  And this means now in any case that you're a lawyer.
[01:05:20.609 --> 01:05:28.012]  When you're there giving them information or preparing your case, we'll go report on you to the prosecution and to the judge.
[01:05:28.192 --> 01:05:32.614]  Now, that is a 180 from what America was founded to be.
[01:05:32.694 --> 01:05:33.514]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:05:34.094 --> 01:05:38.136]  They'll wrap that in an American flag and say you're not patriotic if you don't do it.
[01:05:40.577 --> 01:05:41.897]  So it's very serious.
[01:05:41.937 --> 01:05:44.438]  And I remember it was really about three years ago.
[01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:45.579]  I said two years ago.
[01:05:45.599 --> 01:05:48.200]  It was about three years ago Houston Chronicle had a big headline.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:49.140]  It was in a bunch of papers.
[01:05:50.626 --> 01:05:58.714]  The bar said that they wanted to get rid, the big American Bar Association, their president was in Chicago at the time.
[01:05:58.774 --> 01:06:01.917]  He said, juries are bad.
[01:06:03.118 --> 01:06:05.401]  We want to go ahead and phase out juries.
[01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:08.063]  That's what Europe's going to, getting rid of juries.
[01:06:08.143 --> 01:06:14.490]  And we've been treated to the Wall Street Journal and USA Today and the Washington Post and all these articles where...
[01:06:15.385 --> 01:06:26.751]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg and even the conservative justices have said, you know, seven out of nine are so-called conservatives, but look at all their record, how they've been voting, how they've been ruling.
[01:06:28.252 --> 01:06:31.754]  You'll see the neocon nature, but they've all been saying, we're going to follow U.N.
[01:06:31.894 --> 01:06:34.596]  orders, criminal court orders, and we're under this.
[01:06:36.296 --> 01:06:40.739]  We follow the precedence of the international order, was one quote.
[01:06:42.034 --> 01:06:46.597]  So, getting rid of juries, your lawyer works for the government and tattles on you.
[01:06:46.697 --> 01:06:49.959]  They've already been doing that for a while, but now it's just going to be out in the open.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:56.422]  So, everything America was is disappearing, and I'm glad that caller mentioned that.
[01:06:57.023 --> 01:06:57.843]  But that's okay.
[01:06:57.883 --> 01:07:03.747]  We can talk about Colby Bryant and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:07:03.807 --> 01:07:09.650]  Again, we're not going to talk about how they've announced they're going to build three dozen giant
[01:07:10.672 --> 01:07:21.317]  Level 4 bioweapons labs that produce stuff worse than smallpox, worse than anthrax.
[01:07:22.458 --> 01:07:24.439]  Super weaponized Ebola.
[01:07:24.959 --> 01:07:26.780]  Super weaponized smallpox.
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:30.301]  See, a level 3 is just smallpox or anthrax.
[01:07:30.742 --> 01:07:33.503]  A level 4 is weaponized.
[01:07:35.959 --> 01:07:36.560]  We're good to go.
[01:07:53.699 --> 01:07:55.340]  Jacques Cousteau, countless others.
[01:07:55.881 --> 01:07:58.963]  We have the official Australian and U.S.
[01:07:59.003 --> 01:08:02.005]  government plans to exterminate half the third world.
[01:08:02.326 --> 01:08:16.156]  We have the 1973 plan commissioned by Dr. Kennedy Kissinger where it orders the third world to sterilize half their women forcibly if they want IMF and World Bank debt forgiveness.
[01:08:19.654 --> 01:08:20.635]  I've posted that many.
[01:08:20.715 --> 01:08:21.456]  It's an official.
[01:08:21.516 --> 01:08:23.137]  It's on the Library of Congress website.
[01:08:23.737 --> 01:08:24.798]  Oh, none of that matters.
[01:08:24.818 --> 01:08:30.663]  It's just stuff that's right out of some late-night horror movie, right out in the open, the real world.
[01:08:31.143 --> 01:08:32.224]  That doesn't matter.
[01:08:32.244 --> 01:08:35.587]  No, no, it doesn't matter.
[01:08:37.569 --> 01:08:44.234]  The Congress moving, my friends, for blanket, total, unlimited immigration,
[01:08:45.499 --> 01:08:53.086]  Anyone who can get here can instantly, instantly be legalized from anywhere but Western Europe.
[01:08:53.126 --> 01:08:55.328]  If you're from Western Europe, forget it.
[01:08:55.608 --> 01:08:57.530]  There's actually a stipulation.
[01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:59.892]  You can't let prisoners run, folks.
[01:09:00.452 --> 01:09:03.054]  Those that are dumb enough to come to the slave grid, though, let them come.
[01:09:04.736 --> 01:09:05.797]  That's kind of how it works.
[01:09:05.857 --> 01:09:11.321]  I think, frankly, those Indians hiding out in the jungles have got it right.
[01:09:13.656 --> 01:09:16.578]  Oh, but down in Latin America, they've got the U.N.
[01:09:16.598 --> 01:09:20.841]  with the biospheres forcing them off their land up to Mexico City as the staging ground.
[01:09:20.861 --> 01:09:25.164]  The NAFTA highway is built right up into California and Texas and Arizona.
[01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:33.851]  The government's giving them the invasion backpacks, comic books written at a second-grade level.
[01:09:34.531 --> 01:09:35.912]  This is La Reconquista.
[01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:41.256]  That's all funded out of Washington by the big white bankers who want to break America down.
[01:09:42.717 --> 01:09:44.937]  It's quite a system, but you know what?
[01:09:44.977 --> 01:09:46.418]  It doesn't really matter, folks.
[01:09:48.778 --> 01:09:49.778]  No, it doesn't matter.
[01:09:51.559 --> 01:09:52.519]  Doesn't matter at all.
[01:09:53.459 --> 01:09:55.679]  Because we got Hollywood!
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.520]  Okay.
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.420]  Oh, but Mel Gibson makes something wholesome.
[01:10:03.981 --> 01:10:07.381]  And his dad comes on this show and talks about decent, wholesome things.
[01:10:08.501 --> 01:10:11.062]  And we count the Gibson family as listeners of this network.
[01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:11.942]  We appreciate them listening.
[01:10:15.013 --> 01:10:16.954]  And I got articles today.
[01:10:18.655 --> 01:10:27.278]  The film's going to be boycotted by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, because it shows the Pharisees calling for Christ to be killed.
[01:10:27.418 --> 01:10:30.460]  Well, that's not anti-Semitic.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.021]  I mean, Jesus was a Semite.
[01:10:34.381 --> 01:10:35.842]  Palestinians are Semites.
[01:10:36.302 --> 01:10:37.943]  The Jews are Semitic.
[01:10:39.443 --> 01:10:40.784]  Just means you're from that area.
[01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:43.101]  I mean, that's how crazy it's gotten.
[01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:45.342]  Jesus is now racist, folks.
[01:10:46.182 --> 01:10:50.804]  And they actually say that in there, that the New Testament is racist.
[01:10:51.344 --> 01:10:52.884]  And there's moves in Europe to ban it.
[01:10:52.944 --> 01:10:54.425]  I read the BBC News articles.
[01:10:55.705 --> 01:11:01.587]  Because Christ points his finger at them and says, you know, you're evil, you're corrupt, you're of the devil.
[01:11:01.607 --> 01:11:06.248]  He was talking to the establishment Pharisees.
[01:11:06.268 --> 01:11:09.789]  He wasn't talking about the Jews as a whole.
[01:11:11.139 --> 01:11:12.861]  He was talking about Jews that didn't accept him.
[01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:17.304]  And again, folks, whether you believe in Jesus Christ or not, this is not a religious show.
[01:11:17.424 --> 01:11:18.005]  I'm a Christian.
[01:11:18.045 --> 01:11:20.467]  I make no secret of that.
[01:11:20.907 --> 01:11:22.868]  But the point is, this affects you.
[01:11:23.349 --> 01:11:23.729]  Okay?
[01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:32.056]  You may be like Arnold who says in Evolution of a Bodybuilder that he doesn't like Jesus Christ and that he sees himself as Christ.
[01:11:32.616 --> 01:11:33.857]  He doesn't like Christians.
[01:11:34.978 --> 01:11:36.339]  Maybe you're that type of person, but
[01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:54.968]  You need to understand how in the thought crime world, now, just having a movie about Jesus Christ in Aramaic and Hebrew and Latin so threatens the ADL that they're running around trying to boycott the film.
[01:11:55.349 --> 01:11:57.090]  Oh, don't show it in theaters.
[01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:58.992]  It's evil.
[01:12:02.114 --> 01:12:03.836]  And by the way, the Roman history is there.
[01:12:04.824 --> 01:12:08.147]  Jesus Christ is one of the most well-documented people in history.
[01:12:08.427 --> 01:12:12.109]  He did live, he was killed, and he did rise again, folks.
[01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:13.851]  That's what the Romans say.
[01:12:14.892 --> 01:12:24.779]  And he did live that selfless, pure life, and he was killed at the behest of the Jewish establishment.
[01:12:25.359 --> 01:12:26.560]  And he was Jewish!
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:27.261]  So now...
[01:12:31.491 --> 01:12:38.758]  I mean, I guess then you're anti-Semitic if you're one of the Jews who's against against building the wall in Israel.
[01:12:38.798 --> 01:12:41.641]  I mean, it's a sick... They just beat you over the head with this.
[01:12:41.962 --> 01:12:49.049]  Well, don't talk about Paul Wolfowitz and how he publicly supports taking people's rights away because he's Jewish and that's anti-Semitic.
[01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:51.211]  You know, or...
[01:12:52.242 --> 01:12:57.823]  Or don't talk about Richard Perle, who says he wants to invade all these countries because he's Jewish.
[01:12:59.004 --> 01:13:00.764]  It's nothing more than a tool, folks.
[01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:06.805]  You've got a bunch of Nazis and a bunch of all-together folks when it comes to tyranny.
[01:13:08.806 --> 01:13:18.688]  But, oh, here in our free country, Mel Gibson's in deep trouble because it shows the Pharisees gloating as Jesus is killed.
[01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:20.449]  That's not right.
[01:13:21.409 --> 01:13:21.629]  See?
[01:13:23.859 --> 01:13:33.485]  Under EU law, they are restricting preaching the first books and the last books there in the New Testament.
[01:13:33.945 --> 01:13:38.648]  I've read the BBC News articles where they're like, oh, yes, it's very hateful of us in there.
[01:13:39.909 --> 01:13:41.890]  Preachers could be arrested if they read from this.
[01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:48.414]  In Pennsylvania, the Republican governor passed a law where you read the passages criticizing homosexuals, you could be arrested.
[01:13:48.934 --> 01:13:50.395]  That was all over the news last year.
[01:13:51.169 --> 01:13:55.352]  Are you starting to figure out how late it is, folks?
[01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:00.515]  Let's talk to Kelly in Texas.
[01:14:00.595 --> 01:14:01.376]  Kelly, you're on the air.
[01:14:01.396 --> 01:14:01.796]  Go ahead.
[01:14:04.698 --> 01:14:04.938]  Hello?
[01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:06.079]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:14:06.259 --> 01:14:06.519]  Okay.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:10.662]  I wanted to mention an article in yesterday's USA Today.
[01:14:10.842 --> 01:14:14.844]  It's on the front cover, and it reads, Who's watching the class?
[01:14:15.064 --> 01:14:17.506]  Webcams in schools raise privacy issue.
[01:14:17.526 --> 01:14:18.887]  And it talks about...
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:29.645]  The school district in Mississippi where all these cameras are watching the classrooms, they're watching the hallways, and they can be accessed by the Internet.
[01:14:30.525 --> 01:14:36.688]  Well, did you hear the people, we had the lawyers and the family and all that stuff up on several shows.
[01:14:38.661 --> 01:14:42.184]  Where in Tennessee, they put them in the 10-year-old girls' and boys' showers.
[01:14:42.384 --> 01:14:43.825]  Yeah, the dressing rooms and everything.
[01:14:44.025 --> 01:14:46.186]  And then they got the World of Wonder Channel 4.
[01:14:46.547 --> 01:14:47.307]  It's not World of Wonder.
[01:14:47.327 --> 01:14:48.208]  That's a production company.
[01:14:48.248 --> 01:14:50.289]  Channel 4 is the group doing it.
[01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:58.895]  Over in England, where they're going to put a bunch of 10-year-olds together to have sex in a house.
[01:14:59.355 --> 01:15:00.296]  And that's normal.
[01:15:00.616 --> 01:15:01.457]  Oh, that's horrible.
[01:15:02.719 --> 01:15:03.460]  That's horrible.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:09.884]  Oh, no, you're being cross-minded, and the Scotland Yard Diversity Unit may arrest you.
[01:15:10.945 --> 01:15:15.989]  Did you know now that the Scotland Yard is arresting people if they criticize that?
[01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:18.135]  That's absolutely horrible.
[01:15:18.175 --> 01:15:25.420]  But this is almost worse because they're announcing it and they talk about how the parents love it, how they can watch their kids at home.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:30.824]  They can get on the Internet and watch their kids and see if they're behaving, see if they're wearing it.
[01:15:30.864 --> 01:15:33.586]  See, that's the psychology behind the cameras on the highway.
[01:15:33.606 --> 01:15:35.007]  Well, you can go check the traffic.
[01:15:35.388 --> 01:15:36.108]  You can use it.
[01:15:36.368 --> 01:15:42.553]  But now they admit, oh, DARPA did put this in and we're going to use it now to face scan you and control you and...
[01:15:43.013 --> 01:15:45.736]  We're going to go ahead and put microwave zappers on top of it.
[01:15:45.776 --> 01:15:48.498]  If you're not good, we're going to go ahead and zap you with it.
[01:15:49.419 --> 01:15:54.964]  Yeah, and the superintendent says, and it quotes, it helps honest people be more honest.
[01:15:55.805 --> 01:15:58.327]  Oh, that's a nice double thing, yeah.
[01:15:58.347 --> 01:16:00.289]  Right, like what do I have to hide?
[01:16:00.369 --> 01:16:01.870]  Do you have anything to hide?
[01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.592]  But the government's all secret.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:05.301]  Right.
[01:16:05.541 --> 01:16:09.904]  There's a move to make legislatures meetings secret.
[01:16:09.964 --> 01:16:10.724]  Sounds good, doesn't it?
[01:16:10.744 --> 01:16:12.165]  Oh, well, they should be.
[01:16:12.185 --> 01:16:14.947]  I mean, we have to protect ourselves against the terrorists.
[01:16:15.527 --> 01:16:19.850]  The terrorists are going to get us, Kelly, and we've got to submit properly.
[01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:21.451]  Sounds like you've got more to add.
[01:16:21.471 --> 01:16:22.092]  Stay there, Kelly.
[01:16:22.132 --> 01:16:23.793]  I'm not going to let you comment more.
[01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:26.455]  Then we'll go to Elaine and others that are holding.
[01:16:28.147 --> 01:16:29.048]  Oh, yeah.
[01:16:29.348 --> 01:16:30.529]  Folks, you think I'm joking.
[01:16:30.809 --> 01:16:31.890]  It's mainstream news.
[01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:37.594]  We're going to deploy Humvees and other systems with classified mind control devices.
[01:16:38.835 --> 01:16:40.196]  Okay, this is being announced.
[01:16:44.051 --> 01:16:48.533]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:16:48.893 --> 01:16:52.974]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:53.274 --> 01:16:53.815]  We listened.
[01:16:54.135 --> 01:16:59.117]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:59.397 --> 01:16:59.877]  We listened.
[01:17:00.257 --> 01:17:03.298]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.718 --> 01:17:04.259]  We listened.
[01:17:04.719 --> 01:17:08.080]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:08.680]  We're good to go.
[01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.951]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:17:37.991 --> 01:17:40.512]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:49.935]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:17:50.175 --> 01:17:52.416]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:17:52.616 --> 01:17:58.958]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:17:59.358 --> 01:17:59.738]  Thank you.
[01:18:19.548 --> 01:18:20.169]  We're good to go.
[01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:44.939]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:18:45.379 --> 01:18:49.722]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:18:50.002 --> 01:18:55.806]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:18:56.047 --> 01:19:00.089]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:06.034]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:19:06.154 --> 01:19:08.756]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:19:10.857 --> 01:19:14.759]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:19:14.799 --> 01:19:17.161]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:19:17.521 --> 01:19:19.822]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:19:20.203 --> 01:19:23.825]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:19:24.305 --> 01:19:30.509]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:19:30.949 --> 01:19:31.910]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:32.610]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:32.890]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.790]  I'm taking collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:45.393]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:19:45.573 --> 01:19:46.273]  It feels great.
[01:19:46.453 --> 01:19:47.454]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:52.979]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:19:53.239 --> 01:19:55.020]  I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:58.363]  I've lost 16 pounds, and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:19:58.463 --> 01:19:59.144]  Incredible.
[01:19:59.344 --> 01:20:00.565]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:20:00.585 --> 01:20:04.288]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:20:04.568 --> 01:20:08.011]  Sharon lost 28 pounds with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:20:08.411 --> 01:20:14.918]  I have arthritis, and I have a thyroid problem and blood pressure, and Vim and Vigor has really been a blessing to me.
[01:20:15.178 --> 01:20:20.904]  I've lost 28 pounds and counting, and I thank them very much from the bottom of my heart.
[01:20:21.265 --> 01:20:25.990]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:27.371]  Call right now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:20:27.391 --> 01:20:27.671]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:20:31.135 --> 01:20:31.195]  1-800-622-8446
[01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:03.938]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[01:21:03.958 --> 01:21:07.739]  And we're going straight back to your calls, wide open phones.
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:09.600]  Kelly in Texas, go ahead and finish up.
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:16.763]  So you don't think it's part of a freedom to be surveilled by cameras at all times by the government?
[01:21:16.883 --> 01:21:19.164]  I mean, isn't that what freedom is all about?
[01:21:19.885 --> 01:21:21.505]  Yeah, that's exactly what freedom is about.
[01:21:21.766 --> 01:21:29.609]  But it's really frightening also because it acclimates all the children that are being surveilled all the time to...
[01:21:30.248 --> 01:21:41.030]  Live in a surveillance society, and when they graduate high school, when they get out of, you know, all of this training, basically, they won't mind the telescreen watching every move they make.
[01:21:41.411 --> 01:21:42.811]  Well, no, that's it, exactly.
[01:21:42.911 --> 01:21:50.793]  And then for five years, they've been thumb-scanning kids to get school lunches, and in many cases, making them enter a social security number with it.
[01:21:50.893 --> 01:21:53.853]  They admit that's to train them to thumb-scan to buy and sell.
[01:21:53.873 --> 01:21:56.214]  I mean, this is the system.
[01:21:57.655 --> 01:22:01.739]  Yeah, and it's moving really fast, and I was so surprised to see it on the front page.
[01:22:02.439 --> 01:22:04.761]  Really, I mean, it's just right there.
[01:22:04.821 --> 01:22:08.765]  I mean, you look at it, it's Bush is for open borders and blanket amnesty.
[01:22:08.825 --> 01:22:10.867]  Bush wants to ban your guns because he's good.
[01:22:11.948 --> 01:22:14.650]  The Supreme Court is following the orders of the U.N.
[01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:14.950]  now.
[01:22:15.511 --> 01:22:19.194]  Cameras are going to surveil everything you do, and I've got the article right here you're talking about.
[01:22:19.694 --> 01:22:20.775]  This is a new system.
[01:22:21.055 --> 01:22:27.681]  Blimps with ground-penetrating radar are going to videotape everything inside your house every day.
[01:22:28.161 --> 01:22:32.845]  DARPA is going to face-scan you and use new mind-control devices.
[01:22:33.245 --> 01:22:34.006]  They already do.
[01:22:34.046 --> 01:22:38.450]  They face-scan you, you know, hundreds of times a day.
[01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:39.651]  Kelly, it's horrible.
[01:22:40.591 --> 01:22:42.093]  And you are definitely on target.
[01:22:42.113 --> 01:22:42.753]  Thanks for the call.
[01:22:43.314 --> 01:22:44.214]  Call back any time.
[01:22:44.695 --> 01:22:45.776]  Elaine in Texas.
[01:22:45.896 --> 01:22:46.896]  Elaine, you're on the air.
[01:22:46.937 --> 01:22:47.357]  Go ahead.
[01:22:48.499 --> 01:22:57.025]  Alex, I just wanted to say, you're doing a good job, and it just seems like some mainstream media is starting to pick up on some things.
[01:22:57.906 --> 01:23:12.277]  Like, I was watching a PBS special on Watergate called 30 Years After, and a lot of people that were commenting on the deceit and stuff in the presidency kept referring back to the Constitution.
[01:23:13.237 --> 01:23:17.799]  And a lot of them are actually considering themselves Constitutionalists.
[01:23:18.399 --> 01:23:31.145]  They said this a lot and it really reminded me of you and really I think there's starting to be a trend of people more interested in our Constitution instead of just
[01:23:31.775 --> 01:23:33.175]  The power of the presidency.
[01:23:33.215 --> 01:23:34.976]  Well, yeah, that's a great point.
[01:23:35.196 --> 01:23:38.777]  When somebody tries to take something, then you care more about it.
[01:23:38.817 --> 01:23:46.960]  It's like an old chair you have on your back porch you don't think much of, but you catch somebody trying to steal it, you're going to get mad about it.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.340]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:53.702]  It was really cool to see it on PBS, too, that I know a lot of people watch.
[01:23:54.242 --> 01:24:00.664]  And in today's paper, the New York Times, there's a commentary by Bob Herbert
[01:24:01.491 --> 01:24:12.878]  It talks about all the Arnold hype and everything, and really just kind of ends with how we're not paying attention to this presidential deceitful practices.
[01:24:13.558 --> 01:24:14.579]  And I thought that was really cool.
[01:24:14.599 --> 01:24:15.499]  That was in the time.
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:19.581]  But you notice, here's the problem with the equation.
[01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:21.883]  And listen, you're making fabulous points, Elaine.
[01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:22.243]  I love it.
[01:24:23.138 --> 01:24:29.123]  But the New York Times will tell the truth on that, but then claim the Democrats are good.
[01:24:29.203 --> 01:24:32.947]  See, they're telling you the Republicans are lying and corrupt, which is true.
[01:24:33.347 --> 01:24:38.752]  But then they'll act like the Democrats are okay, which still is controlled by the globalists.
[01:24:39.212 --> 01:24:43.416]  Well, of course, he was referring to a speech that Al Gore made.
[01:24:44.116 --> 01:24:49.561]  But I was just at least pleased to see that some of the information is starting to poke out there.
[01:24:50.427 --> 01:24:51.488]  They have to do that.
[01:24:51.528 --> 01:24:54.949]  They have to cover it and then try to spin it to their aims.
[01:24:55.029 --> 01:25:04.254]  But no, they're having to respond to us and more and more they're on the defensive and that shows that we're really having an effect, Elaine.
[01:25:04.734 --> 01:25:05.635]  Yes, definitely.
[01:25:06.175 --> 01:25:08.776]  But on the flip side, I'm here in Austin.
[01:25:09.497 --> 01:25:15.960]  This past weekend there was just a complete media blackout on what was going on in Alabama.
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.401]  And I had heard a snippet of it, so I was
[01:25:19.116 --> 01:25:41.291]  Trying in vain to find out what exactly was going on, until finally I saw a little piece on, I believe it was ABC, between the state of Alabama and the federal government fighting over, I believe it's getting rid of our own weapons of mass destruction.
[01:25:41.811 --> 01:25:43.372]  And they were arming the citizens...
[01:25:44.266 --> 01:25:46.567]  With bio suits and stuff.
[01:25:46.607 --> 01:25:55.312]  And it's really kind of horrifying to see a little baby get to a whole full year because Alabama lost against the federal government.
[01:25:56.133 --> 01:26:01.355]  Well, what they're doing is they're terrorizing us with terrorists are going to hit you.
[01:26:01.395 --> 01:26:02.256]  Terror, terror.
[01:26:02.436 --> 01:26:03.297]  Tonight, terror.
[01:26:03.417 --> 01:26:05.998]  We'll be discussing the threat of terror and how the government will help you.
[01:26:06.538 --> 01:26:07.599]  They're the terrorists.
[01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:11.766]  They're the people trying to scare us to, quote, do what they want.
[01:26:12.246 --> 01:26:14.308]  It's hidden in plain view, folks.
[01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:15.709]  Thanks for the call, Elaine.
[01:26:15.749 --> 01:26:16.330]  Appreciate it.
[01:26:17.251 --> 01:26:20.694]  Ken, Terry, Mark, a bunch of other people.
[01:26:20.714 --> 01:26:21.554]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:26:21.574 --> 01:26:22.295]  We've got some guests.
[01:26:22.335 --> 01:26:24.757]  We'll take your calls while the guests are on.
[01:26:25.277 --> 01:26:28.660]  We've got a bunch of other news, but the callers are bringing up a lot of the key news.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.381]  See, I love that.
[01:26:30.222 --> 01:26:30.742]  Stay with us.
[01:26:33.244 --> 01:26:34.185]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.205 --> 01:26:36.167]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.137 --> 01:26:39.938]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:47.142]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:26:47.342 --> 01:26:52.804]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:26:53.064 --> 01:26:56.006]  Ideal for I-340-7091.
[01:26:56.206 --> 01:26:59.767]  That web address again is calbinpuresoap.com.
[01:27:00.008 --> 01:27:02.849]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:27:23.246 --> 01:27:24.066]  Alright, folks.
[01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:28.087]  Welcome back to the middle of the second hour.
[01:27:28.127 --> 01:27:31.988]  We've got about an hour and 26 minutes left in this broadcast today.
[01:27:32.008 --> 01:27:37.229]  I am going to throw out some different news articles to our guests and get their response to it.
[01:27:37.269 --> 01:27:37.809]  I know we have
[01:27:38.439 --> 01:27:39.580]  Loaded phones as well.
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.701]  We will get to your calls before this hour ends.
[01:27:44.502 --> 01:27:50.664]  I'm about to go to my guests here in a few minutes, but let's keep them on hold for just a second because I want to introduce them first, and then I want to plug my videos.
[01:27:52.965 --> 01:28:06.131]  Paul Revere is a well-known minister, non-establishment minister in the U.S., and they have their peaceful community attacked by tanks and
[01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:13.765]  And smashed and crushed, and he was chased through the woods by them, and all that happened, and since then his church has gotten much larger.
[01:28:13.785 --> 01:28:21.990]  And we're going to be talking about Romans 13 and how the churches say that we're supposed to follow all orders of the government.
[01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:24.032]  The government is basically God.
[01:28:24.052 --> 01:28:30.776]  This was one of Hitler's most favorite things to promote and say.
[01:28:31.356 --> 01:28:33.097]  It's taken totally out of context.
[01:28:33.477 --> 01:28:34.418]  The New Bibles...
[01:28:35.564 --> 01:28:39.248]  Are being edited and changed and altered in amazing ways.
[01:28:40.529 --> 01:28:52.921]  And so even if you're not a Christian, this is very interesting because it's kind of that Orwellian memory hole where history's being altered all around us and in front of us.
[01:28:54.983 --> 01:28:58.466]  And I heard Mr. Revere yesterday on the air with...
[01:29:00.353 --> 01:29:04.975]  I'm not getting off into a debate about eschatology versus other interpretations of the Bible, but I do agree with Mr. Anderson.
[01:29:20.618 --> 01:29:28.745]  About his comment that a lot of the churches lie down and say we're not supposed to be involved because, you know, Jesus is going to come back and do it all for us.
[01:29:29.245 --> 01:29:33.409]  This is very important to understand what's happening inside the New World Order.
[01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:37.653]  And, you know, I'm a Christian, and I make no bones about that.
[01:29:37.713 --> 01:29:48.742]  But at the same time, I don't get involved in a debate between the denominations because that's more diversions and distractions and divide and conquer.
[01:29:49.685 --> 01:29:52.207]  The New World Order absolutely loves it.
[01:29:52.807 --> 01:29:58.632]  But at the same time, you've got to criticize the establishment church when it's saying, lay down the government, follow its orders.
[01:29:58.652 --> 01:30:15.104]  We're going to be discussing that in this mass mind control that we see developing through the World Council of Churches, through the faith-based initiative that's now got Baptist churches having anti-gun day, UN days, right here in Austin, folks.
[01:30:16.727 --> 01:30:25.150]  Being paid off by the government, and they already have federal funds and federal control, despite the fact that faith-based initiative has not passed.
[01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:26.570]  This is going on.
[01:30:27.810 --> 01:30:39.694]  Now, before I go to our guests to talk about this very serious issue, I do want to remind the listeners that I have now produced my ninth video, and it's two hours and 40 minutes long.
[01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:41.935]  It's really three films in one.
[01:30:42.475 --> 01:30:45.776]  It's titled Police State 3, Total Enslavement,
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:31:03.564]  It documents Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, gun control, forced inoculations, dozens of examples of government-sponsored terrorism, government-run white slavery rings, and we've got to expose that so that we can back them off and they'll stop doing it.
[01:31:05.105 --> 01:31:06.365]  That's all coming up.
[01:31:08.027 --> 01:31:09.768]  And that's all covered in the film.
[01:31:09.848 --> 01:31:16.511]  And I do have some guests getting into the gun control issue, the forced inoculation issue, the government-run white slavery issue.
[01:31:16.691 --> 01:31:19.452]  I think it's on Monday.
[01:31:20.533 --> 01:31:25.575]  But you really need to get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:31:25.655 --> 01:31:29.477]  And later in the next hour, I'm also going to get into some of the new Patriot Act 2 developments.
[01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:31.218]  But don't wait, folks.
[01:31:31.338 --> 01:31:35.400]  You need to get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:31:35.996 --> 01:31:38.639]  You need to get America Destroyed by Design.
[01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:48.087]  You need to get 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny that details September 11th and how the globalists carried out 9-1-1 to scare the public into submission.
[01:31:48.768 --> 01:31:52.932]  If we don't do that, they're going to continue to blow stuff up and pose as our saviors.
[01:31:52.992 --> 01:31:57.676]  And by the way, in the next hour, I do have some more news on 9-1-1 as well, so stay tuned.
[01:31:58.717 --> 01:32:01.700]  We're going to hold our guest over to the next hour, and I appreciate him joining us.
[01:32:02.873 --> 01:32:07.656]  But before we go to our guests, I just want you to write down the toll-free number and get the videos to get the books.
[01:32:07.816 --> 01:32:15.060]  I've now got the new book out that I published for Paul Joseph Watson, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terrorism and the New World Order.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:21.203]  Very important to take action to get the films, to get the books, and to educate those around you.
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:24.261]  The toll-free number to order is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:24.281 --> 01:32:24.882]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:32:24.982 --> 01:32:29.744]  Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order via our secure online shopping cart.
[01:32:29.764 --> 01:32:32.846]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar.com.
[01:32:49.782 --> 01:32:50.662]  Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:32:51.123 --> 01:32:52.343]  So, by the way, the new book is 334 pages long.
[01:32:52.363 --> 01:32:52.443]  It's $19.95.
[01:32:52.483 --> 01:32:56.265]  You get a second book for only $12, $12 additional dollars.
[01:32:56.345 --> 01:32:57.665]  The Order Out of Chaos book, the films are $25.95.
[01:32:57.845 --> 01:32:59.106]  Order three or more, they drop down to $20 apiece.
[01:33:14.198 --> 01:33:21.786]  All right, that's enough for me ranting and raving about the documentaries and some of the stuff coming up in the last 20 minutes of the next hour when I get into some more of the news.
[01:33:23.788 --> 01:33:33.318]  My guess would probably say that even talking about the New World Order is a bigger distraction than talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger and Colby Bryant.
[01:33:33.979 --> 01:33:36.962]  But we've got to expose this evil system.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:43.727]  And we've got to expose the fact that the globalists are kidnapping children en masse.
[01:33:44.408 --> 01:33:56.461]  They would argue, though, and putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, they would argue that until you free a man's heart and soul, you're still going to have that evil regardless of what you do.
[01:33:57.529 --> 01:34:03.215]  And I agree with them, but at the same time, you've got to show people the evil so they realize how evil the system is.
[01:34:03.255 --> 01:34:18.992]  But joining us to talk about a bunch of issues, but first and foremost, Romans 13 and how the establishment church and Hitler then and now are saying lay down to the government are John Anderson, who hosts his own show here on the network.
[01:34:20.366 --> 01:34:21.146]  Time for truth.
[01:34:21.667 --> 01:34:23.628]  And Paul Revere, and that's his name.
[01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:30.033]  Paul Revere, tell us about yourself a little bit, and then John Anderson, tell us about yourself, and let's launch into Romans 13.
[01:34:30.113 --> 01:34:32.995]  Hello, Alex.
[01:34:33.035 --> 01:34:38.559]  This is Paul Revere, pastor for Embassy of Heaven Church, and I'm glad to be on your show.
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:39.020]  You bet.
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.541]  Good to have you on.
[01:34:40.801 --> 01:34:47.766]  We have a website for those that would like to study Romans 13, and it's just Romans13.com.
[01:34:49.304 --> 01:34:54.489]  And we've got all kinds of articles there.
[01:34:54.789 --> 01:35:00.114]  And as more is revealed about Romans 13, we'll keep putting more articles up.
[01:35:02.916 --> 01:35:08.882]  As far as my personal life, I was called to the ministry approximately 25 years ago.
[01:35:08.902 --> 01:35:15.688]  And I've converted completely over to Christianity.
[01:35:16.614 --> 01:35:24.439]  And we have suffered at the hands of the states, of the United States, for our faith and for our belief.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:32.745]  And we have basically lost all of our property because we would not go along with their program.
[01:35:33.005 --> 01:35:36.768]  They sent armored vehicles in, smashed everything, and chased you and others?
[01:35:37.288 --> 01:35:37.688]  Oh, yes.
[01:35:38.008 --> 01:35:46.154]  About 1997, there was about, like, I hate to even give them any credit being jurisdiction, but there was about
[01:35:46.638 --> 01:35:54.706]  Five jurisdictions, state, county, city, SWAT teams, Oregon National Guard, federal, they all came out.
[01:35:54.746 --> 01:36:05.235]  They had guard tanks running down the highways out here, and they came and they removed everybody from the 34 acres.
[01:36:05.456 --> 01:36:08.799]  Now, you had always, your whole group was about being nonviolent.
[01:36:09.419 --> 01:36:10.861]  What were they alleging to do this?
[01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:13.731]  It was rather interesting.
[01:36:13.751 --> 01:36:18.254]  I never really understood until I heard it on national television.
[01:36:19.475 --> 01:36:27.061]  After the raid, the Strange Universe, which is a national program, wanted to give us a segment of their program.
[01:36:27.421 --> 01:36:28.042]  I saw that.
[01:36:28.422 --> 01:36:29.843]  And I said, no, I wouldn't do it.
[01:36:29.983 --> 01:36:32.065]  And they said, well, what would encourage you?
[01:36:32.125 --> 01:36:36.528]  And I said, well, if you gave the county a piece of the segment.
[01:36:36.748 --> 01:36:38.189]  They said, well, what do you want to do that for?
[01:36:38.729 --> 01:36:40.631]  I said, well, because if you don't interview them,
[01:36:41.263 --> 01:36:43.263]  People won't understand what happened to us.
[01:36:44.224 --> 01:36:45.504]  Okay, so they interviewed.
[01:36:45.564 --> 01:36:55.726]  Well, the attorney for the county was posed one of the questions which I had prepared, which was, why such force against the peace-loving people?
[01:36:56.766 --> 01:36:59.506]  And the response took us all by surprise.
[01:36:59.586 --> 01:37:08.728]  The lady attorney stated, and I quote, we have not had a problem like this since the Civil War between the states in the North and the South.
[01:37:09.676 --> 01:37:18.300]  And what they had perceived us as is we were withdrawing from the Union, and therefore they used the same technique that the North used on the South.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:19.241]  That's amazing.
[01:37:19.441 --> 01:37:21.802]  I don't want to get sidetracked here.
[01:37:21.822 --> 01:37:23.803]  I appreciate you going back into that history.
[01:37:24.123 --> 01:37:25.224]  I mean, I'm the one that brought it up.
[01:37:25.404 --> 01:37:33.548]  Romans 13, if you just read the whole page, it clearly says that if God gives you these godly leaders...
[01:37:34.168 --> 01:37:34.768]  We're good to go.
[01:37:34.788 --> 01:37:35.288]  I think?
[01:38:03.357 --> 01:38:07.578]  Lay down to this evil, and it's so important for folks to be aware of it.
[01:38:09.138 --> 01:38:10.499]  Well, Alex, it's good to be with you.
[01:38:12.039 --> 01:38:23.182]  First of all, I would say Romans 13 is certainly an issue because it's used as a hammer to convince people that they need to obey the various officials, etc., of the world.
[01:38:23.922 --> 01:38:32.104]  However, the deeper problem lies within the aspect of where our own controversy comes in, Alex, is that the, quote,
[01:38:32.955 --> 01:39:01.292]  New World Order or the elite that you talk about, the Rothschild family who through their vehicle Oxford Press printed a Bible in 1909 called the Schofield Reference Bible in which it through its notes in the Bible showed how prophecy had not been fulfilled therefore this one world government had to come about and in doing so
[01:39:02.009 --> 01:39:04.132]  It would be fulfilling biblical prophecy.
[01:39:05.413 --> 01:39:11.660]  So the big lie has caused the other lies to be very well neatly fit into place.
[01:39:12.882 --> 01:39:16.526]  Well, John, I'm going to have you guys on 40 minutes into the next hour.
[01:39:16.586 --> 01:39:18.829]  If you have time, we're going to take some calls.
[01:39:21.281 --> 01:39:23.562]  Again, I'm still studying that, and I'm not sure where I stand on it.
[01:39:23.582 --> 01:39:34.465]  I understand you're saying it's the root, but I've read Romans 13, and I've heard other teachings on it, and it clearly, clearly says don't go along with corrupt governments.
[01:39:34.525 --> 01:39:37.325]  There's hundreds of other examples in the Bible of that.
[01:39:37.686 --> 01:39:40.626]  Hitler used Romans 13, so can we focus?
[01:39:41.206 --> 01:39:47.028]  I want to get both your takes on Romans 13, because I heard you guys talking about it yesterday, and it's very important.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:48.960]  Who do you want first?
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:49.761]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:39:50.101 --> 01:39:51.641]  Okay.
[01:39:52.461 --> 01:40:04.745]  Romans 13, to really treat it properly, it would... Well, let's take where you were hearing us, Alex, yesterday.
[01:40:05.866 --> 01:40:12.188]  The Living Bible is probably the greatest abomination that I'm aware of as far as the treatment of Romans 13.
[01:40:12.248 --> 01:40:16.649]  The reason the Living Bible is because it's a paraphrase
[01:40:17.422 --> 01:40:18.783]  ...of a translation.
[01:40:18.803 --> 01:40:21.664]  In other words, it's like about three steps removed.
[01:40:22.724 --> 01:40:30.667]  The paraphrase, what they do is that they replace the words with what they would refer to as more modern words.
[01:40:31.888 --> 01:40:33.508]  That would be at least their take on it.
[01:40:34.008 --> 01:40:43.632]  In reality, what they're doing is they're writing the Scripture from their own perspective or from the perspective of the people that are planning on reading it.
[01:40:44.973 --> 01:40:45.733]  The question is,
[01:40:46.246 --> 01:40:47.907]  Whose Bible are we reading?
[01:40:48.648 --> 01:40:49.949]  Whose book does it belong to?
[01:40:49.969 --> 01:41:02.377]  Well, what happens if, let's say, a foreign group of people come along and they want to understand a passage better, so then they'll rewrite the words and use the language that they would use, which they would understand?
[01:41:02.397 --> 01:41:15.927]  Well, the Living Bible is basically written from a secular viewpoint or a statist viewpoint or a world viewpoint, specifically from a North American or the United States viewpoint.
[01:41:16.724 --> 01:41:30.453]  Most people have been trained in society by public school systems to think secular, to think in terms of the conquerors over the land known as America.
[01:41:31.313 --> 01:41:32.074]  And I'll show it.
[01:41:32.674 --> 01:41:33.575]  Romans 13, 1.
[01:41:35.796 --> 01:41:39.859]  Obey the government, for God is the one who put it there.
[01:41:40.259 --> 01:41:43.721]  There is no government anywhere that God has not placed in power.
[01:41:44.182 --> 01:41:46.063]  That's the one that Hitler used.
[01:41:47.230 --> 01:41:57.853]  He is a government, and actually he's a world government, and so therefore he basically instructed the people that his government wasn't there unless God put him there.
[01:41:57.893 --> 01:42:06.295]  So since he's there, verse 2, So those who refuse to obey the laws of the land are refusing to obey God, and punishment will follow.
[01:42:07.675 --> 01:42:13.677]  For the policeman does not frighten people who are doing right, but those doing evil will always fear him.
[01:42:14.335 --> 01:42:19.056]  So if you don't want to be afraid, keep the laws, and you will get along well.
[01:42:19.456 --> 01:42:20.637]  It actually says that?
[01:42:20.937 --> 01:42:21.257]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:21.277 --> 01:42:22.197]  This is the Living Bible.
[01:42:22.237 --> 01:42:23.617]  Anybody can go pick up the Living Bible.
[01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:27.918]  And then, folks, you read what the King James says right out of the Greek and the Hebrew.
[01:42:27.978 --> 01:42:29.659]  It's the total opposite.
[01:42:29.699 --> 01:42:30.519]  This is incredible.
[01:42:31.759 --> 01:42:39.081]  Fourth verse, the policeman is sent by God to help you, but if you are doing something wrong, of course, you should be afraid, for he will...
[01:42:40.431 --> 01:42:51.975]  So that means if the cop is a racketeer, a criminal, which they get caught all the time doing, doesn't matter, that's God's work, that's good.
[01:42:53.016 --> 01:42:59.658]  Well, the scripture, Alex, was not written for the United States of America.
[01:42:59.878 --> 01:43:01.699]  Never has been, never will be.
[01:43:01.759 --> 01:43:03.420]  This thing was written 2,000 years ago.
[01:43:05.365 --> 01:43:19.933]  If it was written 2,000 years ago, if we were to examine the original language, we should find that we should have Rome, since Rome was the world power at that time, it should have Roman words.
[01:43:21.054 --> 01:43:27.057]  At verse 4, instead of being the policeman is sent, we should find something about a Roman centurion.
[01:43:27.858 --> 01:43:32.621]  Well, when we go back to the original text, which is Greek, we don't find Roman centurion.
[01:43:33.161 --> 01:43:34.962]  We find the word for minister.
[01:43:35.583 --> 01:43:36.784]  Which is a deacon.
[01:43:37.344 --> 01:43:44.067]  A deacon is an officer within the body of the church, the congregation, the assembly.
[01:43:44.688 --> 01:43:52.512]  And so Paul in his writing of Romans 13 is not writing to the people of Rome to be subject to Caesar.
[01:43:53.572 --> 01:43:56.834]  He's writing that the people should be subject to the
[01:43:57.403 --> 01:44:03.045]  To the church, which he was very involved in trying to bring forth a new government.
[01:44:03.065 --> 01:44:04.905]  Well, I mean, I've read the whole chapter.
[01:44:04.965 --> 01:44:06.626]  That's clearly what it's all about.
[01:44:07.066 --> 01:44:12.007]  And then they take it, change it, and say, and then Hitler says, you know, follow what I have to say.
[01:44:12.888 --> 01:44:13.628]  Follow my orders.
[01:44:13.668 --> 01:44:19.149]  Well, then Christ was bad then going in and beating the money changers with a whip.
[01:44:20.490 --> 01:44:22.230]  He should have submitted to that government.
[01:44:23.511 --> 01:44:24.311]  Alex, here's...
[01:44:25.290 --> 01:44:38.713]  The problem that's being identified beautifully in many aspects of the Bible, understanding the Bible and allowing it to interpret itself, as opposed to putting our own thoughts on it, which I'll get into when I get back.
[01:44:40.493 --> 01:44:53.136]  All right, but we really should read out of the King James Version and then compare it to that living Bible, because that's, and it's not the same thing, and they're using this, folks.
[01:44:54.756 --> 01:44:55.536]  They all used it.
[01:44:56.156 --> 01:44:57.617]  They used it to impress people.
[01:44:58.597 --> 01:44:59.277]  And it's wrong.
[01:45:00.137 --> 01:45:01.218]  It's mind control.
[01:45:03.918 --> 01:45:06.219]  As a doctor, you're able to cure and heal your patients.
[01:45:06.459 --> 01:45:09.079]  Unfortunately, there's more than that to a successful medical practice.
[01:45:09.339 --> 01:45:14.181]  Confirming appointments, rescheduling missed visits, and sending reminders is inconvenient and time-consuming.
[01:45:14.381 --> 01:45:16.541]  A team of receptionists is a costly solution.
[01:45:16.861 --> 01:45:20.022]  GTI Technologies has an efficient and manageable answer.
[01:45:20.262 --> 01:45:20.943]  We're good to go.

[01:47:03.630 --> 01:47:07.974]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:08.134 --> 01:47:12.559]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:12.719 --> 01:47:17.103]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:47:17.143 --> 01:47:18.465]  The New World Order.
[01:47:20.265 --> 01:47:24.489]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:47:24.549 --> 01:47:31.475]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:47:31.615 --> 01:47:33.697]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:33.857 --> 01:47:44.447]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:47:44.627 --> 01:47:45.708]  If you want to understand what
[01:47:45.708 --> 01:47:46.028]  That's 888-253-3139.

[01:48:07.034 --> 01:48:07.574]  Don't worry.
[01:48:07.994 --> 01:48:09.535]  This show is documented.
[01:48:10.035 --> 01:48:12.796]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:13.216 --> 01:48:16.718]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:48:16.738 --> 01:48:18.538]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[01:48:18.839 --> 01:48:25.481]  And I know that we've got Ken and Terry and Mark and Al and Steve and others that are patiently holding.
[01:48:25.661 --> 01:48:28.362]  We will get to your calls early in the next hour.
[01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:32.484]  And I'm interested to see how Paul Revere and John Anderson respond to all of them.
[01:48:32.864 --> 01:48:34.485]  Those are both very intelligent men.
[01:48:35.145 --> 01:48:35.545]  And, uh...
[01:48:36.503 --> 01:48:42.424]  Are definitely saying a lot of things that are different than what we hear from a lot of the mainstream folks out there.
[01:48:42.944 --> 01:48:44.405]  We're just trying to get folks to think here.
[01:48:44.545 --> 01:48:58.768]  But, John Anderson, you were trying to make a point here about Romans 13 and what the King James Version clearly says and how they take it out of context there.
[01:48:58.828 --> 01:48:59.248]  Go ahead.
[01:48:59.888 --> 01:49:02.769]  Okay, here's an example, Alex, that I think will...
[01:49:03.542 --> 01:49:05.603]  Serve to show the point.
[01:49:05.963 --> 01:49:11.926]  If I ask you, because you deal a lot with this, to name three founding fathers right off the top of your head, who would you name?
[01:49:12.987 --> 01:49:16.069]  Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Thomas Paine.
[01:49:16.609 --> 01:49:17.589]  Okay, exactly.
[01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:20.931]  What if I named Peter, John, and Paul?
[01:49:22.192 --> 01:49:31.797]  You see, it's our concept going in when we read the Bible with the preconceived idea, thus we come up with the wrong answer.
[01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:38.895]  Because our founding fathers as Christians were the disciples, the holy inspired apostles.
[01:49:40.616 --> 01:49:46.001]  This is an example that Paul used in our program yesterday and it illustrates the point perfectly.
[01:49:46.744 --> 01:49:59.411]  Because we deal so much in the secular world, our mind functions and operates that way, so therefore we want to deal with spiritual things with a secular mind, and it doesn't work.
[01:49:59.651 --> 01:50:04.194]  Scriptures tell us the carnal mind cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God.
[01:50:04.314 --> 01:50:12.539]  Well, I understand that, but you guys also just went into the comparison of the Living Bible to the King James, and...
[01:50:13.619 --> 01:50:20.181]  I mean, the big news here is, or one of the pieces of news is, they're editing and changing the Bible.
[01:50:20.721 --> 01:50:23.262]  I mean, that's, again, I use the term Orwellian.
[01:50:24.002 --> 01:50:25.122]  That's a big deal.
[01:50:25.442 --> 01:50:33.344]  Well, it certainly is, and it goes all the way back to 1909 when the Schofield Bible was produced by Oxford Press.
[01:50:33.765 --> 01:50:40.806]  Why would Oxford Press, owned and controlled by the Rothschilds, want to, quote, produce something Christian?
[01:50:42.247 --> 01:50:42.867]  Have you ever wondered?
[01:50:44.850 --> 01:50:47.832]  Well, I know it basically tells folks to lay down to evil.
[01:50:48.492 --> 01:50:54.775]  Well, what it does is it absolutely lies specifically even about Scripture.
[01:50:55.095 --> 01:50:58.497]  And I'll give you this one example to show you you want to talk about evil?
[01:50:59.277 --> 01:51:00.778]  Here's something that's out and out evil.
[01:51:01.198 --> 01:51:11.803]  When you go to Matthew 24, 34, Jesus speaking, this generation will not pass until all these things be fulfilled.
[01:51:12.564 --> 01:51:12.804]  Okay?
[01:51:13.942 --> 01:51:20.226]  Well, in the Schofield Notes, you'll look at the word Jenna, which is 1074, and he gives the correct word.
[01:51:20.826 --> 01:51:26.970]  However, he goes to 1085 and gives the definition of Jenna's for Jenna.
[01:51:27.411 --> 01:51:28.491]  Now, one of two things, Alex.
[01:51:28.692 --> 01:51:33.855]  That's the most horrible, quote, scholarship in the world, or it's out-and-out deception.
[01:51:34.395 --> 01:51:39.559]  Because Jenna means the contemporary generation that Jesus was speaking to.
[01:51:39.819 --> 01:51:40.179]  They give
[01:51:40.754 --> 01:51:44.757]  The definition of genos, which means race or kind of people.
[01:51:44.777 --> 01:51:50.300]  Do you see how the deception was laid in to modern evangelical Christianity?
[01:51:51.861 --> 01:51:57.125]  Well, this is getting into the subject of have we already had the end times?
[01:51:57.205 --> 01:51:57.805]  Are they coming?
[01:51:57.845 --> 01:51:58.806]  Will there be a rapture?
[01:51:58.846 --> 01:51:59.867]  Won't there be a rapture?
[01:52:00.807 --> 01:52:06.271]  And I'm still studying that and looking at that, and all I see is pure evil around me.
[01:52:06.891 --> 01:52:09.553]  And then you say, well, that's just the wickedness of man's heart.
[01:52:11.111 --> 01:52:14.053]  Well, okay, they're setting up an anti-Christ system.
[01:52:14.294 --> 01:52:23.682]  Okay, let me share something with you, okay, because here's a misconception among many Christians, Alex and all sincerity, they believe that, quote, evil is going to be eradicated from the planet, all right?
[01:52:24.582 --> 01:52:27.185]  Now, for just a moment, and as you know, I'm a preterist.
[01:52:27.745 --> 01:52:34.231]  The voice of reason teaches preterism, period, as far as eschatology or last things, which means past fulfillment.
[01:52:34.271 --> 01:52:34.411]  Now,
[01:52:34.895 --> 01:52:39.559]  Well, let's say for a moment that you are a futurist, one that believes the book of Revelation is yet to be fulfilled.
[01:52:39.619 --> 01:52:40.580]  Tell you what, we've got a break.
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:41.221]  We've got a break.
[01:52:41.261 --> 01:52:41.861]  Stay right there.
[01:52:42.502 --> 01:52:45.444]  Look, all I'm saying is I agree with Paul Revere.
[01:52:45.505 --> 01:52:47.686]  I agree with you about Romans 13.
[01:52:47.747 --> 01:52:48.307]  That's clear.
[01:52:49.068 --> 01:52:50.569]  Let's talk about the other stuff when we get back.
[01:52:50.609 --> 01:52:51.270]  I don't know about that.
[01:52:54.192 --> 01:53:00.358]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:53:01.053 --> 01:53:12.149]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.654 --> 01:53:20.294]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.955 --> 01:53:22.015]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.736 --> 01:53:23.816]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.476 --> 01:53:25.297]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.057 --> 01:53:26.938]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.958 --> 01:53:31.260]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:35.922]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:39.344 --> 01:53:41.805]  Explosions rock U.S.
[01:53:42.045 --> 01:53:44.046]  Iraq base overnight.
[01:53:44.086 --> 01:53:45.767]  There's been more bombings in Israel.
[01:53:46.599 --> 01:53:51.854]  British soldiers face wrath of Iraqis as hatred festers on streets of Basra.
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:58.581]  We've got a bunch of other articles here about superbugs spread into community.
[01:53:58.701 --> 01:54:02.082]  Antibiotic-resistant superbugs are spreading into the community.
[01:54:02.522 --> 01:54:11.745]  Experts have warned this is much more dangerous than West Nile or monkeypox or any of these diversions that are just like the Arnold Schwarzenegger story.
[01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:13.245]  Just that, diversions.
[01:54:13.285 --> 01:54:15.786]  I'm going to get to that later in this hour.
[01:54:16.226 --> 01:54:17.306]  Taliban warn U.S.
[01:54:17.346 --> 01:54:18.607]  to quit Afghanistan.
[01:54:19.847 --> 01:54:23.128]  Jewish group slams Gibson film as anti-Semitic.
[01:54:24.385 --> 01:54:27.668]  Bush administration paralyzed over Iran.
[01:54:28.789 --> 01:54:31.471]  Just a lot more coming up in this article.
[01:54:31.531 --> 01:54:34.913]  Accused scientist's letter links to anthrax mailers.
[01:54:35.954 --> 01:54:42.879]  We are going to get into this news, and I know that we've got Ken and Terry and Mark and Steve and others.
[01:54:43.199 --> 01:54:44.340]  We're going to get to you as well.
[01:54:45.481 --> 01:54:53.307]  You know, I need to have these guys on, I guess, when we're not in such a hot news cycle of all this worldly stuff that we track here.
[01:54:53.968 --> 01:54:56.830]  But I heard him yesterday talking about Romans 13.
[01:54:58.291 --> 01:55:01.033]  And I've been to Sunday school.
[01:55:01.113 --> 01:55:04.855]  I've read the Romans 13 out of the King James Version.
[01:55:05.436 --> 01:55:16.123]  And you look at what the whole chapter says, and it's about the church and how the church should behave and how the church should be governed and how you should behave.
[01:55:16.243 --> 01:55:21.787]  And then they take it and they translate it and change it into worship the government, follow any orders that it has to say.
[01:55:22.167 --> 01:55:23.048]  And Hitler used this.
[01:55:24.239 --> 01:55:26.461]  And it's just so dangerous.
[01:55:26.621 --> 01:55:31.105]  And then John Anderson, who's a preterist, they believe that in 70 A.D.
[01:55:32.386 --> 01:55:41.714]  that it was finished and that we now all have the, you know, that Jesus finished his work and that now the only evil that's here is the evil of man and the devil's gone.
[01:55:41.734 --> 01:55:44.256]  Hey, we want to talk about this.
[01:55:44.296 --> 01:55:44.876]  That's fine.
[01:55:44.916 --> 01:55:46.137]  We can take calls on the issue.
[01:55:46.177 --> 01:55:48.699]  People are saying, well, wait, we're going to have a religious show.
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:53.043]  This affects the psyche of the world, folks, whether you believe in God or not.
[01:55:53.994 --> 01:55:55.234]  This affects the psyche.
[01:55:55.254 --> 01:56:03.497]  And I know a lot of these big churches can't stand up against evil because they say, oh, we're about to get taken out of here and it's not our responsibility.
[01:56:04.097 --> 01:56:10.998]  My Bible says it is your responsibility to stand up against the works of darkness, to speak out against evil, to fight corruption.
[01:56:11.579 --> 01:56:13.919]  And so let me ask John Anderson and Paul Revere that.
[01:56:14.679 --> 01:56:15.940]  Because although the Bible...
[01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:31.017]  There's many passages about how we're supposed to dig in the wall and look in and expose the evil that's going on, but sometimes I listen to you guys and I get the idea that that's not my job.
[01:56:31.077 --> 01:56:32.818]  I mean, what are we supposed to do?
[01:56:32.838 --> 01:56:38.901]  Okay, I'd like to jump in, Alex, if I could, to finish what we were talking about right before we went to the break.
[01:56:39.282 --> 01:56:39.562]  Sure.
[01:56:40.302 --> 01:56:40.982]  Here's the point.
[01:56:41.883 --> 01:56:43.124]  As you said, I'm a preterist.
[01:56:43.204 --> 01:56:46.746]  I understand that Revelation was fulfilled in 70 A.D., period.
[01:56:47.146 --> 01:56:47.286]  Now,
[01:56:48.038 --> 01:56:48.838]  The issue is this.
[01:56:49.039 --> 01:56:52.260]  If you're a futurist, and there are many that are listening that are, here's my point.
[01:56:53.501 --> 01:56:55.742]  I will give you that for a moment for this supposition.
[01:56:56.562 --> 01:57:05.847]  When we get to Revelation 20, the so-called millennial reign, then we come to Revelation 21, which is the New Jerusalem run, the establishment of the new heaven and earth and the kingdom of God.
[01:57:06.968 --> 01:57:11.230]  Now we go to Revelation 22 and the culmination of the climax.
[01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:16.413]  In Revelation 22, 15, after the new heaven and earth and after the kingdom of God has been established,
[01:57:18.021 --> 01:57:19.421]  Verse 15 of Revelation 22.
[01:57:19.621 --> 01:57:25.583]  For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and adulterers, and whosoever loveth and maketh the lie.
[01:57:25.943 --> 01:57:27.303]  Now, that's the point.
[01:57:27.423 --> 01:57:29.563]  You see, here's the problem that people don't understand.
[01:57:30.264 --> 01:57:31.444]  That is existing now.
[01:57:31.504 --> 01:57:34.624]  The kingdom of God is a living, current reality now.
[01:57:35.305 --> 01:57:41.346]  And outside the kingdom, which is the spiritual kingdom, are the dogs, the sorcerers, the liars, the whoremongers, and the people that you talk about.
[01:57:41.366 --> 01:57:42.046]  Alright?
[01:57:43.146 --> 01:57:47.147]  But evil was never, ever going to be eradicated in the world.
[01:57:48.183 --> 01:57:55.106]  But the kingdom of God, through his people, his will will be done and is being done on earth now as it is in heaven.
[01:57:55.346 --> 01:57:55.726]  Okay.
[01:57:56.406 --> 01:57:59.048]  We'll discuss when we get back.
[01:57:59.108 --> 01:58:04.570]  And if anybody disagrees with this, the preachers, pastors, listeners, you can call in too.
[01:58:04.610 --> 01:58:08.531]  We've got other callers here that are on other issues, but we'll all tie in together.
[01:58:08.952 --> 01:58:11.333]  And we have Paul Revere on the line as well.
[01:58:11.353 --> 01:58:11.973]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:15.031 --> 01:58:15.451]  We're good to go.
[01:58:39.679 --> 01:58:40.199]  Slow credit?
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:40.880]  Bad credit?
[01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:41.541]  No problem.

[01:59:11.643 --> 01:59:19.487]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:19.667 --> 01:59:24.090]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:24.230 --> 01:59:28.612]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:59:28.652 --> 01:59:29.973]  The New World Order.
[01:59:30.743 --> 01:59:31.964]  We're good to go.
[01:59:57.225 --> 01:59:58.927]  That's 888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word.
[02:00:14.464 --> 02:00:16.125]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.446 --> 02:00:22.190]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:27.574]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:00:27.914 --> 02:00:37.201]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[02:00:42.826 --> 02:00:46.850]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.

[02:01:05.728 --> 02:01:06.929]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:20.740]  Big Brother.
[02:01:21.401 --> 02:01:22.441]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:23.161 --> 02:01:24.282]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:24.922 --> 02:01:25.742]  You want answers?
[02:01:26.523 --> 02:01:28.423]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:28.443 --> 02:01:31.745]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:32.245 --> 02:01:36.366]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:36.567 --> 02:01:42.969]  All right, folks, we've got John Anderson.
[02:01:43.069 --> 02:01:44.029]  He's a prodigal.
[02:01:44.090 --> 02:01:44.850]  They think that...
[02:01:46.565 --> 02:01:52.909]  That the end of the world, or the end of Jerusalem, was in 80-70 with Titus.
[02:01:54.330 --> 02:01:58.872]  And I tell you, I listen to the show, and it's confusing, because I agree with some things they say.
[02:01:58.912 --> 02:02:04.075]  I see the problems with the modern church that says, lay down the corruption, go along with it.
[02:02:04.696 --> 02:02:11.080]  And then I hear these guys saying that... Well, I've heard them say, these guys are just talking about the New World Order all day.
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:14.882]  I get sick of it, I heard Anderson say yesterday, because...
[02:02:15.623 --> 02:02:19.388]  Because, you know, the answer is right here in our hearts and souls and minds.
[02:02:20.289 --> 02:02:22.953]  If we just come to Christ, we wouldn't have an evil society.
[02:02:23.413 --> 02:02:24.935]  Well, you said it best.
[02:02:24.955 --> 02:02:26.377]  There's still going to be evil people.
[02:02:26.817 --> 02:02:32.485]  They're still going to come in army tanks and try to kill Christians, just like they do all the time.
[02:02:33.209 --> 02:02:35.730]  So I've got to expose China killing Christians.
[02:02:35.850 --> 02:02:38.552]  I've got to expose the government kidnapping children.
[02:02:38.872 --> 02:02:45.675]  I've got to expose them putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, because that is saving lives, and we are saving lives.
[02:02:45.735 --> 02:02:52.198]  So, you know, this is very confusing stuff, and I know to you guys it's not confusing.
[02:02:52.218 --> 02:02:59.262]  That must be a very comfortable place to be in, but I'm just very confused.
[02:03:00.342 --> 02:03:04.483]  Alex, Jesus said if you know the truth, John 8, 32, that the truth will set you free.
[02:03:05.103 --> 02:03:10.224]  Once you know the truth and you are set free, then yes, your mind is on that which is of God.
[02:03:11.405 --> 02:03:14.565]  You are to be wise as serpents, but gentle as doves.
[02:03:15.165 --> 02:03:17.006]  Not to be an idiot with your head in the sand.
[02:03:17.106 --> 02:03:23.567]  No one is purporting that, but the idea until, as you pointed out, the hearts and the minds of people are changed.
[02:03:23.767 --> 02:03:25.748]  You're going to have physical governments.
[02:03:26.468 --> 02:03:27.308]  One of my points is
[02:03:28.311 --> 02:03:28.531]  This.
[02:03:28.951 --> 02:03:30.832]  Paul worked within the system that he lived in.
[02:03:31.772 --> 02:03:34.433]  People today need to learn to work within the system that they're in.
[02:03:34.813 --> 02:03:38.075]  I hear a lot of people saying, this is bad and that's bad and that's bad.
[02:03:38.155 --> 02:03:38.855]  Okay, great.
[02:03:38.935 --> 02:03:40.876]  Let's take all of those guys and get rid of them.
[02:03:41.056 --> 02:03:42.016]  Now, who's going to run it?
[02:03:42.476 --> 02:03:47.518]  My concern is those coming in that don't like what's going on, are they going to do a whole lot better?
[02:03:47.898 --> 02:03:48.078]  No.
[02:03:48.459 --> 02:03:54.061]  Well, I've said that many times that we need to, I mean, we're getting studies to pass laws against the Patriot Act.
[02:03:54.441 --> 02:03:57.342]  We are taking action within and without from all angles.
[02:03:58.791 --> 02:04:09.817]  You see, the problem is we want a physical, literal king, just like nationalistic Israel did in 1 Samuel 8.
[02:04:11.118 --> 02:04:17.081]  And Samuel took it to the Lord, and the Lord said, because of this, Samuel, they have not rejected you.
[02:04:17.594 --> 02:04:19.935]  But they have rejected me that I should not reign over them.
[02:04:20.195 --> 02:04:24.898]  And as a matter of fact, I'm going to give them that king, but Samuel, you're going to tell them what it's going to cost them.
[02:04:25.258 --> 02:04:32.982]  Read 1 Samuel chapter 8 starting in verse 10 and go through verse 14, and you will see that God said these are all the things he's going to take from you.
[02:04:33.182 --> 02:04:35.383]  He's going to take your daughters to be cooks.
[02:04:35.563 --> 02:04:36.864]  He's going to take your men servants.
[02:04:37.044 --> 02:04:38.765]  He's going to take your fields.
[02:04:38.985 --> 02:04:40.566]  He's going to take your horses.
[02:04:40.726 --> 02:04:41.906]  He's going to take your cattle.
[02:04:42.006 --> 02:04:43.227]  What does that sound like, Alex?
[02:04:44.372 --> 02:04:48.173]  Well, it sounds like exactly the things we see today, a corrupt bureaucracy.
[02:04:48.473 --> 02:04:51.254]  Those will not be ruled by God, must be ruled by tyrants.
[02:04:51.895 --> 02:04:57.777]  Well, something else I heard you say that I agree with, that we're supposed to all mindlessly support Israel.
[02:04:58.557 --> 02:05:07.960]  Well, over and over again, God said, if Israel doesn't follow my covenant, I will put them into bondage, and that did happen over and over again.
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.742]  We have a secular Israel run by the New World Order, and...
[02:05:13.263 --> 02:05:16.266]  You know, oh, they're engaged in all this corruption, so are the Palestinians.
[02:05:16.286 --> 02:05:17.107]  They're corrupt as well.
[02:05:17.127 --> 02:05:17.987]  It's another government.
[02:05:18.668 --> 02:05:24.373]  But then the so-called Christian church says, you've got to support Israel no matter what they do, or you can't get into heaven.
[02:05:24.754 --> 02:05:25.755]  Now, that's not in the Bible.
[02:05:25.795 --> 02:05:26.715]  Where's the evidence of that?
[02:05:26.815 --> 02:05:34.282]  Well, no, it's utter nonsense, because first of all, Israel as a nation ceased to exist in 70 A.D.
[02:05:36.053 --> 02:05:37.773]  That was Judah's final demise.
[02:05:38.053 --> 02:05:50.356]  Israel, which was the ten northern tribes that went into Assyrian captivity, that was known as the Diaspora, the dispersion, from 745 to 726 B.C., 800 years before Christ, they had become the Gentiles, if you will.
[02:05:50.896 --> 02:06:03.378]  But Revelation is written to the destruction of Judah because Judah was not divorced, even though Israel was, Jeremiah 3.8, because the Messiah had to come through Judah, and he did.
[02:06:04.389 --> 02:06:14.773]  But once that was happening, it fulfilled the prophecy of Genesis 4-9-10 that the scepter would not pass from Judah, nor a lawgiver between his feet, until Shiloh come, and to him shall the gathering of the people be.
[02:06:14.833 --> 02:06:16.514]  Shiloh is Prince of Peace in the Hebrew.
[02:06:16.814 --> 02:06:26.438]  So when he came, that was their end, as he said in Matthew 21-43, the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to another nation, bringing forth the fruits thereof.
[02:06:28.988 --> 02:06:32.029]  Now, again, getting back, and we're going to go to calls here in a second.
[02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:47.256]  Paul Revere comments, I mean, really, this Romans 13, you read what Romans 13 said and has to say about from the establishment, Bibles worship the government, it's all perfect, all-knowing, God put it there.
[02:06:47.316 --> 02:06:48.576]  I guess follow Hitler's orders.
[02:06:48.616 --> 02:06:49.297]  Hitler said that.
[02:06:50.217 --> 02:06:56.800]  And then what the actual Hebrew has to say, what the King James has to say, what's the difference there?
[02:06:57.603 --> 02:07:03.748]  Okay, Alex, Romans 13 never, ever said to obey the government.
[02:07:04.128 --> 02:07:07.210]  Even in King James, it doesn't use the word government.
[02:07:08.591 --> 02:07:13.355]  And government in terms, especially as world government or secular government.
[02:07:13.375 --> 02:07:21.461]  Apostle Paul was writing, let's take, first of all, you've got to know who wrote it.
[02:07:21.809 --> 02:07:24.330]  Who he's writing to and who the audience is.
[02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:27.732]  Well, these guys were all killed for not following the government's orders.
[02:07:28.112 --> 02:07:28.833]  That's right.
[02:07:29.333 --> 02:07:34.436]  They were put to death because there was one greater than Caesar, one named Jesus Christ.
[02:07:34.656 --> 02:07:35.556]  And what were they promoting?
[02:07:35.856 --> 02:07:37.097]  God's government on earth.
[02:07:37.497 --> 02:07:40.599]  Let's take Paul of Romans, Romans 1-7.
[02:07:41.539 --> 02:07:42.360]  Who is he writing to?
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:42.660]  He says,
[02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:52.021]  Called to be saints, grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[02:07:52.342 --> 02:07:57.323]  The Apostle Paul is writing to the church, to the ecclesiastical order.
[02:07:57.843 --> 02:08:06.085]  He is writing in Romans 13, 1-7, his directives towards these called out ones on whom they're to obey.
[02:08:06.125 --> 02:08:09.186]  Now was Paul saying obey Caesar of Rome?
[02:08:10.186 --> 02:08:10.787]  Absolutely not.
[02:08:10.847 --> 02:08:16.088]  And Caesar of Rome at that time is equivalent to Bush of the United States or
[02:08:16.590 --> 02:08:19.051]  Whatever Presidente of whatever world government.
[02:08:19.071 --> 02:08:20.611]  We're not going to pick on just America.
[02:08:20.631 --> 02:08:22.032]  We're going to pick on the whole world.
[02:08:23.572 --> 02:08:28.254]  So Apostle Paul is now writing, and he is setting up the church.
[02:08:28.414 --> 02:08:36.316]  The theologians will all agree that from the book of Acts to the end of the Bible is the ecclesiastical age, the church age.
[02:08:36.356 --> 02:08:42.458]  This is where the kingdom of God is put in place, and they are setting up God's government as it is on earth.
[02:08:42.478 --> 02:08:42.918]  Now, if Paul...
[02:08:46.331 --> 02:08:47.592]  I mean, we've all seen this before.
[02:08:47.632 --> 02:08:48.713]  It's like the Bill of Rights.
[02:09:10.353 --> 02:09:12.574]  It says these are just pointing out your God-given rights.
[02:09:12.634 --> 02:09:14.215]  They're all individual rights.
[02:09:14.875 --> 02:09:19.678]  And then a professor will look you right in the eyes and say, or a judge, none of these are individual rights.
[02:09:19.898 --> 02:09:23.700]  I mean, they'll take what something says and totally flip it around.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:28.962]  But again, we get into... I heard you guys mention this yesterday.
[02:09:29.262 --> 02:09:36.366]  Where do you stand then on the founding fathers of this country standing up to England?
[02:09:36.406 --> 02:09:36.626]  I mean...
[02:09:37.419 --> 02:09:40.081]  Because, again, this is where it gets real confusing.
[02:09:40.261 --> 02:09:41.722]  Well, it's real simple, Alex.
[02:09:42.102 --> 02:09:47.686]  If you take a look, well, from Scripture, Jesus says that good seed produces good fruit.
[02:09:48.467 --> 02:09:50.128]  Bad seed produces bad fruit.
[02:09:50.608 --> 02:09:51.929]  Good cannot produce bad.
[02:09:51.989 --> 02:09:55.031]  Bad cannot produce good.
[02:09:56.332 --> 02:10:05.739]  Well, what did the United States, the people, the deists of that time, those who were referred to as the founding fathers of the country in America...
[02:10:07.389 --> 02:10:08.950]  Where did these people come from?
[02:10:08.970 --> 02:10:10.491]  They were not all deists.
[02:10:11.292 --> 02:10:12.613]  The majority of them were.
[02:10:12.653 --> 02:10:14.294]  About a third.
[02:10:14.434 --> 02:10:15.695]  Some of the prominent ones were.
[02:10:16.816 --> 02:10:21.619]  We can go into other areas, but really the point is they came from England.
[02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:26.403]  It was a teenager who had grown up and said, I want a piece of the action.
[02:10:27.423 --> 02:10:29.225]  I don't want the mother country to rule us.
[02:10:29.305 --> 02:10:30.446]  We want to rule ourselves.
[02:10:31.266 --> 02:10:32.787]  So that's really where it came from.
[02:10:34.529 --> 02:10:36.270]  Therefore, they were fighting their own kin.
[02:10:37.579 --> 02:10:41.620]  They were fighting, but they wanted to be a teenager that grew up.
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:43.300]  Did it come out of Ecclesia?
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:46.481]  Did it come out of the kingdom of God?
[02:10:47.161 --> 02:10:48.541]  No, it cannot possibly have.
[02:10:49.142 --> 02:10:50.922]  It came out of the world.
[02:10:51.322 --> 02:10:57.063]  And they even in their own declarations declared, we take equal station among the powers of the earth.
[02:11:00.424 --> 02:11:05.625]  Well, I'm glad they did what they did, or we wouldn't even exist right now.
[02:11:06.424 --> 02:11:07.325]  We don't know that.
[02:11:07.865 --> 02:11:08.446]  Oh, come on.
[02:11:08.486 --> 02:11:19.695]  You're saying that John Anderson and Alex Jones and Paul Revere, you're even named after one of them, wouldn't have existed.
[02:11:21.316 --> 02:11:23.938]  I mean, look, we wouldn't exist right now.
[02:11:23.978 --> 02:11:26.120]  It was obviously God's plan.
[02:11:26.140 --> 02:11:31.765]  I mean, do you think God just turns things on and just turns it loose?
[02:11:32.925 --> 02:11:33.746]  I think he did.
[02:11:34.106 --> 02:11:39.809]  In fact, at one point he repented that he even made man, and he desired to destroy the whole world.
[02:11:41.590 --> 02:11:43.231]  And we're still in rebellion to him.
[02:11:44.252 --> 02:11:50.935]  So it's rebellious if I go out on my own, and I'm a Christian, and I go out and I fight evil.
[02:11:53.437 --> 02:11:54.958]  I mean, I go out and I expose evil.
[02:11:54.978 --> 02:11:55.098]  What...
[02:11:56.541 --> 02:11:59.283]  Or I go out and say, I want private property rights.
[02:11:59.664 --> 02:12:00.324]  That's bad.
[02:12:01.025 --> 02:12:08.450]  I fight evil too, but I do it by presenting the truth so people can see what's really going on.
[02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:13.553]  I don't actually go and work on the evil itself.
[02:12:13.954 --> 02:12:22.520]  I just simply try to show people the logic, the reasoning, from whence we come, what are our foundations, and where our focus ought to be.
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:25.622]  And the wicked will have no more power over us
[02:12:26.181 --> 02:12:29.343]  Once we no longer are captured by the evil's ways.
[02:12:30.143 --> 02:12:39.689]  Well, look, I know that's true because they try to push all the drugs and the sex and the debauchery because they know if you're into that, you're going to be weakened.
[02:12:39.749 --> 02:12:41.950]  You're going to be under their control.
[02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:45.011]  I mean, I know that that's true.
[02:12:45.372 --> 02:12:49.654]  Well, when the ladies are getting abortions, it's too late.
[02:12:50.595 --> 02:12:54.817]  We should have been instructing them much earlier than that and that they were killing their babies.
[02:12:56.298 --> 02:13:02.603]  But by speaking out against abortion, I mean, I look at the polls, people are turning against it.
[02:13:02.983 --> 02:13:06.126]  Well, we should be changing their hearts and minds before they do evil.
[02:13:06.466 --> 02:13:09.348]  But that is, well, I agree, but now I'm young.
[02:13:10.349 --> 02:13:12.291]  I'm here fighting it now.
[02:13:12.311 --> 02:13:13.992]  Be right back with your calls, I promise.

[02:15:23.556 --> 02:15:24.919]  Well, it's since gone down another 40%.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.226]  Folks, where will it bottom out?

[02:17:12.199 --> 02:17:13.340]  Mystery solved.
[02:17:16.503 --> 02:17:21.668]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:22.329 --> 02:17:24.611]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:17:31.007 --> 02:17:34.990]  Well, I know the globalists blow stuff up just to blame it on us.
[02:17:36.011 --> 02:17:39.934]  So they can say, look how violent these patriots or these Christians are.
[02:17:40.575 --> 02:17:51.623]  But at the same time, there are many cases where defending yourself or standing up to the globalists or suing them has stopped a lot of their activities.
[02:17:52.904 --> 02:17:57.668]  But on the whole, the wickedness is growing, and these are both interesting gentlemen.
[02:17:57.748 --> 02:17:59.870]  Again, we're about to go to your calls.
[02:17:59.930 --> 02:18:00.110]  Let's...
[02:18:00.828 --> 02:18:02.088]  Got a bunch of people here.
[02:18:03.329 --> 02:18:10.771]  Terry in Washington, you're on the air, then Mark, Steve, Sam, Leslie, and others.
[02:18:10.831 --> 02:18:12.331]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Terry.
[02:18:12.811 --> 02:18:17.793]  Yeah, Alex, don't you give up the blessed hope that these guys are preaching against.
[02:18:17.853 --> 02:18:25.735]  The Lord Jesus Christ is coming back, even if it's at the moment the SWAT team bullet hits my head and the twinkling of an eye.
[02:18:26.375 --> 02:18:30.216]  But the root of all this evil, according to the Bible...
[02:18:30.970 --> 02:18:31.570]  His money.
[02:18:31.590 --> 02:18:43.734]  These phony Bibles that they've been putting out since the 1950s, I quit counting when they reached over 110 back in the 70s.
[02:18:44.935 --> 02:18:48.936]  And the preacher there, Paul Revere, is perfectly right.
[02:18:49.056 --> 02:18:50.817]  That is what the Living Bible says.
[02:18:50.877 --> 02:18:51.517]  I've read that.
[02:18:52.898 --> 02:18:56.999]  And the preachers, they've compromised.
[02:18:57.346 --> 02:18:58.707]  Because of the love of money.
[02:18:59.447 --> 02:19:00.048]  Here's the problem.
[02:19:00.068 --> 02:19:03.010]  You agree with Paul Revere on some things, but you disagree with him on others.
[02:19:03.550 --> 02:19:10.995]  I'm just here having this discussion so people can think, because I'm trying to learn more about this, but I know this.
[02:19:11.175 --> 02:19:14.517]  I'm going to fight the New World Order, and I'm going to stand up against it.
[02:19:14.918 --> 02:19:15.318]  Amen.
[02:19:15.438 --> 02:19:21.282]  I've seen gun bills we've defeated and corrupt people we've put in jail, and I know that we've had an effect.
[02:19:22.022 --> 02:19:27.246]  Yeah, you stick with Tex Morris-type preaching, like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:19:28.072 --> 02:19:41.121]  The reason that Simon Wiesenthal is not exposing him for his Nazi connections is because he gave $5 million to the Simon Wiesenthal Association.
[02:19:41.561 --> 02:19:42.522]  I did not know that.
[02:19:42.782 --> 02:19:45.163]  Well, you can find it in the March 1992 Spy magazine.
[02:19:48.999 --> 02:19:53.862]  Yeah, Arnold's done a lot of hanging out to people that I know of to keep stuff quiet.
[02:19:54.422 --> 02:20:02.627]  That whole thing's a giant diversion, but to see Time Magazine say his father was a police chief, I mean, why not tell the truth?
[02:20:02.667 --> 02:20:03.307]  Thanks for the call.
[02:20:04.328 --> 02:20:06.769]  Any comments to what Terry just said, gentlemen?
[02:20:07.729 --> 02:20:09.510]  Well, one in simplistic form.
[02:20:10.971 --> 02:20:13.893]  I have no doubts of his sincerity, but as Jesus said,
[02:20:14.620 --> 02:20:21.366]  In those days, when he was here to the Pharisees, you make void the word of God by your traditions, and you also err not knowing the scriptures.
[02:20:22.487 --> 02:20:26.170]  First of all, Jesus Christ never ever was going to return in vitally visible form.
[02:20:26.610 --> 02:20:30.193]  He was going to return as he said he would in the glory of the Father.
[02:20:30.753 --> 02:20:37.439]  Number two, he said he would do it in the lifetime of his own contemporaries, and no one can get around that in the scriptures.
[02:20:39.240 --> 02:20:41.582]  All right, let's talk to Mark in Minnesota.
[02:20:41.622 --> 02:20:42.283]  Mark, go ahead.
[02:20:44.702 --> 02:20:44.983]  Alex.
[02:20:45.704 --> 02:20:46.004]  Yes.
[02:20:46.244 --> 02:20:47.406]  And gentlemen, how are you guys doing?
[02:20:47.646 --> 02:20:48.147]  Right.
[02:20:48.247 --> 02:20:51.392]  Well, of course, the Bible tells us, you know, we should do good works.
[02:20:51.432 --> 02:20:53.114]  You know, faith without works is dead.
[02:20:53.855 --> 02:20:56.499]  And I think what you're doing, Alex, is good work.
[02:20:57.160 --> 02:20:57.260]  So...
[02:20:58.311 --> 02:21:01.253]  Yeah, I don't think that it's a waste of time at all.
[02:21:01.273 --> 02:21:02.494]  Well, I know this.
[02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:05.216]  I am absolutely driven to fight the globalists.
[02:21:05.476 --> 02:21:06.437]  Absolutely driven.
[02:21:06.457 --> 02:21:07.438]  Amen.
[02:21:07.578 --> 02:21:09.820]  I mean, I am disgusted by the stuff they're doing.
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:11.681]  It totally freaks me out.
[02:21:12.602 --> 02:21:14.923]  And, you know, I know this.
[02:21:14.983 --> 02:21:16.765]  It's not the devil pulling my strings.
[02:21:18.365 --> 02:21:22.727]  But again, according to John Anderson, and I guess Paul Revere, the devil isn't even around anymore.
[02:21:23.167 --> 02:21:25.948]  Let me ask you guys this question, and really, I respect you.
[02:21:25.968 --> 02:21:30.109]  Alex, that is according to Scripture, not according to John Anderson.
[02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.769]  Hold on.
[02:21:31.149 --> 02:21:32.770]  What I'm trying to ask you here is this.
[02:21:33.390 --> 02:21:37.232]  Why did the world leaders go to the Bohemian Grove to worship the devil?
[02:21:37.492 --> 02:21:39.632]  Why does Arnold Schwarzenegger go there to worship the devil?
[02:21:40.973 --> 02:21:43.414]  Hey, I was involved in the occult for five years of my life.
[02:21:44.474 --> 02:21:45.554]  I went through the nonsense.
[02:21:46.515 --> 02:21:47.335]  I came to the truth.
[02:21:48.078 --> 02:21:50.199]  Of the Lord Jesus Christ in January of 1979.
[02:21:50.599 --> 02:21:54.342]  You know, I've met people that think they've talked to rocks, Alex.
[02:21:55.942 --> 02:21:58.644]  They think they're channeling this, that, so on and so forth.
[02:21:58.784 --> 02:22:00.305]  People have a lot of strange ideas.
[02:22:00.785 --> 02:22:03.427]  What I'm endeavoring to do is to get people back into the Bible.
[02:22:03.447 --> 02:22:04.207]  Well, John, I didn't know that.
[02:22:04.247 --> 02:22:05.868]  What type of occult stuff were you into?
[02:22:06.568 --> 02:22:09.790]  Oh, I was involved in basically pseudo-satanic.
[02:22:09.890 --> 02:22:11.811]  It was what is called a non-blood cult.
[02:22:12.332 --> 02:22:16.254]  We believed in basically the adherence of the Golden Dawn, the Great White Brotherhood.
[02:22:17.498 --> 02:22:19.180]  I worked as a professional psychic.
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:22.923]  I'm the one that made the prediction to Larry Flint, Bungalow No.
[02:22:23.263 --> 02:22:25.986]  6, that there would be an attempt on his life within 30 days.
[02:22:26.006 --> 02:22:27.968]  23 days he was shot in Lawrenceville, Georgia.
[02:22:27.988 --> 02:22:29.069]  That made national headlines.
[02:22:29.089 --> 02:22:29.389]  Oh, really?
[02:22:29.449 --> 02:22:32.091]  How'd you do that if there aren't spirits and things out there?
[02:22:32.111 --> 02:22:33.553]  It's called a lucky guess, Alex.
[02:22:33.993 --> 02:22:41.740]  No, you know, I think... Alex, I have been exposing so-called psychics for the last...
[02:22:43.428 --> 02:22:46.929]  Well, I think there are a bunch of cooks, too.
[02:22:46.949 --> 02:22:48.850]  You've been to see before into that stuff.
[02:22:49.590 --> 02:22:54.551]  But I want to know how you predicted that thing with Larry Flint.
[02:22:54.932 --> 02:22:56.072]  We'll be right back.
[02:22:56.092 --> 02:22:57.192]  This is crazy, folks.
[02:22:57.792 --> 02:22:59.253]  This stuff is all over the map.
[02:23:00.373 --> 02:23:01.454]  But it's interesting.
[02:23:01.694 --> 02:23:03.134]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:23:05.595 --> 02:23:06.535]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.995 --> 02:23:08.596]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.516 --> 02:23:12.197]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.723 --> 02:23:17.525]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:23:17.705 --> 02:23:23.350]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:24.531]  Probably never, right?
[02:23:24.791 --> 02:23:27.754]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau... ...to take droplet form.
[02:23:28.134 --> 02:23:29.656]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[02:23:46.425 --> 02:23:48.166]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[02:23:48.326 --> 02:23:53.808]  And even if you're an atheist out there, folks, you need to understand how important it is.
[02:23:54.908 --> 02:24:02.350]  The fights that are going on in the Christian church and how the big establishment churches I know are evil.
[02:24:03.070 --> 02:24:09.392]  They're out there telling us that it doesn't matter if George Bush goes to Bohemian Grove or Skull and Bones, that he's a godly man.
[02:24:09.432 --> 02:24:11.913]  And they're telling us Arnold's a good guy.
[02:24:11.933 --> 02:24:14.894]  And they're telling us open borders and gun control's good.
[02:24:15.763 --> 02:24:18.444]  And they're telling us we should follow the orders of government.
[02:24:19.444 --> 02:24:25.026]  Well, then we should follow what Yasser Arafat has to say, or somebody of that ilk.
[02:24:25.746 --> 02:24:34.589]  And then I agree with our guests that most of these leaders are evil, whether it's the leaders of Germany or Israel or the Palestinians.
[02:24:34.649 --> 02:24:37.010]  I'm not taking sides here.
[02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:38.850]  I see the corruption all over the place.
[02:24:39.430 --> 02:24:41.791]  I look at the news wires for hours every day.
[02:24:42.549 --> 02:24:45.112]  But then they say, well, you know, we're to be a sheep.
[02:24:45.192 --> 02:24:49.136]  In fact, I heard this comment from Paul Revere yesterday, who I respect.
[02:24:49.616 --> 02:24:51.919]  I mean, he stood up for what he believes in.
[02:24:52.519 --> 02:24:53.260]  He's a good man.
[02:24:53.941 --> 02:24:56.103]  But he said, we're to be a sheep.
[02:24:56.143 --> 02:24:57.304]  And he'll say, well, I didn't say it.
[02:24:57.344 --> 02:24:58.085]  The Bible does.
[02:24:59.443 --> 02:25:02.685]  But then again, you're going to look at it in its context, as they say.
[02:25:02.705 --> 02:25:06.426]  And there are a lot of places where people didn't act like sheep.
[02:25:07.527 --> 02:25:09.147]  John the Baptist didn't act like a sheep.
[02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:10.728]  Jesus Christ didn't act like a sheep.
[02:25:11.008 --> 02:25:12.329]  King David didn't act like a sheep.
[02:25:12.949 --> 02:25:15.030]  And God said that he was beloved.
[02:25:17.395 --> 02:25:19.356]  One of his most beloved or the most beloved.
[02:25:19.796 --> 02:25:20.296]  So I don't know.
[02:25:20.316 --> 02:25:23.837]  There's a lot of different ways to look at this.
[02:25:23.897 --> 02:25:26.057]  And I guess that's where Craig's talked about false prophets.
[02:25:26.497 --> 02:25:27.938]  I'm not saying these guys are bad.
[02:25:27.958 --> 02:25:28.858]  I'm not saying they're good.
[02:25:28.878 --> 02:25:31.338]  I think they're articulate, intelligent men.
[02:25:32.559 --> 02:25:41.661]  Guys, you see where... I mean, I'm just trying to find out exactly where you come from because I listen to your show and some of it makes sense, some of it doesn't.
[02:25:41.941 --> 02:25:42.281]  Okay.
[02:25:42.581 --> 02:25:44.442]  Alex, give me a chance on this one.
[02:25:44.682 --> 02:25:44.962]  Sure.
[02:25:45.602 --> 02:25:45.662]  Um...
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:51.783]  When I say sheep, there are many ways that a sheep can operate within the world.
[02:25:51.803 --> 02:25:55.145]  A wolf will operate in a different manner.
[02:25:55.865 --> 02:26:13.495]  Now, if I can show the people that Romans 13 is not talking about the government of Rome, Romans 13 is not talking about Canada or Mexico or the United States or Russia or any other government of this world, then as a sheep, I can expose or make the truth known
[02:26:14.065 --> 02:26:16.886]  And then the Hitler agenda won't happen again.
[02:26:17.726 --> 02:26:22.328]  And so as a sheep, I can do it without violence or hurting my neighbor.
[02:26:22.809 --> 02:26:23.929]  I can still love my neighbor.
[02:26:23.949 --> 02:26:24.989]  I can love my enemies.
[02:26:25.530 --> 02:26:35.634]  And what we do is impart truth and integrity and logic and reason with people so that they don't go half-cocked out there shooting off their guns.
[02:26:35.814 --> 02:26:41.456]  Well, I know Christ said run to the hills, but he was talking about the particulars of what was going to happen to Jerusalem.
[02:26:43.217 --> 02:26:47.680]  And certainly that's good advice in many cases to, you know, go to the hills.
[02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:49.001]  And a sheep's up in the hills.
[02:26:49.081 --> 02:26:55.325]  But, you know, the classic, I think the classic definition of a mindless sheep, that's the folks following the New World Order.
[02:26:55.645 --> 02:27:00.148]  Okay, Alex, let's take... I understand sheep following the shepherd who is Christ and he'll protect us.
[02:27:00.228 --> 02:27:00.729]  I understand.
[02:27:00.969 --> 02:27:01.889]  Let's take myself.
[02:27:03.610 --> 02:27:05.832]  1997, tanks, machine guns, the whole works.
[02:27:06.412 --> 02:27:09.134]  If I had a gun in my hand, I wouldn't be talking to you today.
[02:27:10.563 --> 02:27:13.704]  Well, you've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk them.
[02:27:13.724 --> 02:27:15.284]  You have to know when to be a sheep.
[02:27:16.184 --> 02:27:17.925]  Well, yeah, I totally agree with you.
[02:27:18.085 --> 02:27:27.587]  Therefore, as a sheep, I am permitted so far by the good Lord to go ahead and preach that Romans 13 is not telling you to obey the world.
[02:27:28.187 --> 02:27:29.427]  But look, I can read it.
[02:27:29.567 --> 02:27:30.347]  It says that.
[02:27:30.768 --> 02:27:32.428]  Maybe I should reread the whole Bible.
[02:27:32.508 --> 02:27:35.569]  I mean, I've studied it some, not as much as I should.
[02:27:35.589 --> 02:27:37.069]  I just can...
[02:27:37.814 --> 02:27:38.194]  I don't know.
[02:27:38.234 --> 02:27:39.195]  Let's go real quick.
[02:27:39.215 --> 02:27:41.537]  We've got a bunch of callers, and I've got some news I've got to hit on.
[02:27:41.977 --> 02:27:43.318]  But this is an important subject.
[02:27:43.718 --> 02:27:45.300]  We'll have to have you back on and discuss it more.
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:46.641]  But real quick, let's go back to the callers.
[02:27:46.961 --> 02:27:48.942]  Mark in Minnesota, I'll let you have one comment.
[02:27:48.982 --> 02:27:49.903]  Finish up your comment.
[02:27:50.303 --> 02:27:53.686]  Yeah, I'm not a preterist, but I'm not a premillennialist either.
[02:27:53.706 --> 02:27:54.727]  I'm an amillennialist.
[02:27:55.607 --> 02:28:00.811]  And I wanted to ask what the guests thought about amillennialism.
[02:28:00.851 --> 02:28:05.434]  Also, the way that I've always interpreted the first verse in Romans 13 says,
[02:28:06.985 --> 02:28:11.871]  It's basically saying that there is no power outside that which God ordains.
[02:28:12.031 --> 02:28:12.992]  Same thing with wisdom.
[02:28:13.773 --> 02:28:22.365]  I notice a lot of Christians, they try to use that to suggest that everybody with might has God-ordained authority or God-ordained power.
[02:28:23.081 --> 02:28:25.082]  And I see circularity in their answer.
[02:28:25.162 --> 02:28:27.883]  Well, then why does the Bible talk about wickedness in high places?
[02:28:28.283 --> 02:28:28.644]  Yeah.
[02:28:28.684 --> 02:28:31.525]  Powers and princes and the principalities.
[02:28:31.825 --> 02:28:34.907]  I mean, all that neutralizes that propaganda.
[02:28:35.087 --> 02:28:39.389]  Well, all it's saying is that the only legitimate authority comes from God.
[02:28:39.409 --> 02:28:40.409]  The same thing with wisdom.
[02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:46.932]  If you were to ask the average Christian, you know, does this government have God-ordained authority?
[02:28:47.212 --> 02:28:49.493]  There's no authority outside that which God ordains, remember?
[02:28:49.873 --> 02:28:50.674]  They would say yes.
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:52.260]  Why?
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:54.621]  Well, because it has... It's like the Old Testament.
[02:28:54.641 --> 02:29:09.165]  It's a long train of God saying, this government's evil, that government's evil, resist it, and I guess that John Anderson and Paul Revere would say that that's the Old Covenant, and that, I don't know, that's where it starts getting confusing.
[02:29:09.685 --> 02:29:16.267]  Because what about the Old Testament, where they're ordered to stand, Israel's ordered to stand up against all these corrupt countries?
[02:29:17.478 --> 02:29:33.247]  Well first of all they were standing up against pagan countries and they were also going to be removed because it was part of the promised land that God had given Israel and as Joshua says in Joshua 21, 43, 44, and 45 that all that God had promised Israel he delivered.
[02:29:35.068 --> 02:29:42.952]  The issue and I want to back up just a second on this whole Satan issue it's not what I'm saying it's what the scriptures teach us.
[02:29:42.992 --> 02:29:43.693]  The problem is
[02:29:44.807 --> 02:29:48.368]  Many good, God-fearing Christians don't have a clue as to what the Bible says.
[02:29:48.628 --> 02:29:50.089]  Okay, where's the devil right now?
[02:29:50.229 --> 02:29:50.649]  Here it is.
[02:29:51.249 --> 02:30:01.652]  Hebrews 2.14 For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also, Christ, likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil.
[02:30:01.853 --> 02:30:03.193]  Did he fail or did he succeed?
[02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:09.022]  But you talk about looking at... Did he fail or did he succeed?
[02:30:09.342 --> 02:30:15.445]  Now, that's a nice lawyer tactic, Mr. Anderson, but I'm going to try to answer your question.
[02:30:16.005 --> 02:30:23.028]  Again, to the jury, it's the implied move that I don't know what I'm talking about, so I'm just here trying to talk if I can.
[02:30:24.069 --> 02:30:31.454]  What I'm saying, Mr. Anderson, is you guys talk all day about how people take things and give it a literal meaning.
[02:30:31.714 --> 02:30:36.998]  Through Christ, if we accept the gift, the devil, his power is destroyed.
[02:30:37.318 --> 02:30:43.802]  What the devil can do to us is destroyed because God is all-powerful if we accept the gift and let him into the door.
[02:30:43.822 --> 02:30:44.403]  Now, see?
[02:30:44.583 --> 02:30:46.064]  How do you handle that argument right there?
[02:30:46.724 --> 02:30:47.345]  Well, it's simple.
[02:30:47.385 --> 02:30:51.848]  Number one, Satan was destroyed as he said he would do.
[02:30:52.626 --> 02:30:53.226]  When he came.
[02:30:53.887 --> 02:30:54.747]  That's why he came.
[02:30:54.807 --> 02:30:55.727]  That's through his death.
[02:30:56.388 --> 02:30:58.268]  He overcame the devil.
[02:30:58.368 --> 02:31:03.711]  Okay, when was the devil in a cage for a thousand years for people to look at him and say, that's the guy that did all this?
[02:31:03.931 --> 02:31:10.854]  Okay, first of all, you're going to Revelation 20, and you're taking the, quote, literalistic 999 years plus one.
[02:31:11.094 --> 02:31:12.935]  But you just did a literalistic thing, too.
[02:31:13.575 --> 02:31:13.995]  No, I didn't.
[02:31:14.095 --> 02:31:16.496]  See, it's all circular, just circles and circles.
[02:31:16.896 --> 02:31:17.296]  No, it isn't.
[02:31:17.316 --> 02:31:18.057]  We're both doing it.
[02:31:18.097 --> 02:31:18.397]  I'm not.
[02:31:18.437 --> 02:31:18.897]  That's why.
[02:31:18.917 --> 02:31:20.858]  I can answer that.
[02:31:21.403 --> 02:31:22.063]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:31:22.364 --> 02:31:22.624]  All right.
[02:31:22.884 --> 02:31:24.205]  In fact, I'm an amillennialist.
[02:31:25.025 --> 02:31:26.446]  I think he's off on his timing.
[02:31:27.207 --> 02:31:30.629]  Amillennialism places us somewhere near the end of Revelation 21.
[02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:36.993]  But in John 12, verse 31, this is what Jesus says.
[02:31:37.013 --> 02:31:38.514]  I have my Bible right here.
[02:31:40.696 --> 02:31:42.297]  John 12, verse 31.
[02:31:43.157 --> 02:31:46.280]  Jesus says, Now is the judgment of this world.
[02:31:46.380 --> 02:31:48.421]  Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
[02:31:50.036 --> 02:31:59.086]  In another scripture, Jesus implies that he came to bind the strong man, i.e., the devil.
[02:31:59.106 --> 02:32:02.769]  And so Satan, he wasn't literally bound in the sense that, you know,
[02:32:08.806 --> 02:32:11.827]  Well, this is, you know, I don't normally go in this direction on the show.
[02:32:11.847 --> 02:32:14.328]  This is pretty rare, folks, but I'm just, this is an important subject.
[02:32:14.348 --> 02:32:16.348]  We'll have to discuss it sometime in the future.
[02:32:16.368 --> 02:32:18.489]  Let's take a few more calls, and I'll let our guests comment.
[02:32:38.499 --> 02:32:40.140]  Because everybody's been holding forever here.
[02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:42.141]  Let's talk to Steve in Florida.
[02:32:42.161 --> 02:32:47.044]  You're on the air with Mr. Anderson and Mr. Revere.
[02:32:47.084 --> 02:32:47.484]  Go ahead.
[02:32:47.704 --> 02:32:48.185]  Hello, Alex.
[02:32:48.205 --> 02:32:49.105]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:32:49.325 --> 02:32:49.686]  You bet.
[02:32:50.206 --> 02:32:51.166]  I originally called.
[02:32:51.246 --> 02:32:52.507]  I didn't know they were going to have the guest.
[02:32:52.527 --> 02:32:59.591]  I do have a question for Mr. Anderson, but I wanted to ask if you received the Time magazine I sent you with Skull and Bones and Mr. Bush.
[02:32:59.671 --> 02:33:00.592]  I had it clearly labeled.
[02:33:00.852 --> 02:33:01.192]  I did.
[02:33:01.332 --> 02:33:03.053]  Thank you so much for that.
[02:33:03.213 --> 02:33:03.734]  Outstanding.
[02:33:04.034 --> 02:33:04.514]  Thank you.
[02:33:04.774 --> 02:33:07.556]  Now, for Mr. Anderson, I do believe...
[02:33:08.174 --> 02:33:19.338]  What they're both saying about Romans chapter 1, I agree there, but everything else I won't even discuss except I want to go to Revelation chapter 13, verse 16 and 17.
[02:33:19.858 --> 02:33:24.160]  Now, Applied Digital Solutions has already started implanting people with microchips.
[02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:26.261]  Alex has been covering it for years.
[02:33:27.401 --> 02:33:31.563]  It does not take a rocket scientist to read Revelation 13, verse 16 and 17 and to realize
[02:33:34.744 --> 02:33:40.588]  That some form of microchip to buy and sell, which will be the mark in Revelation 13, has not happened yet.
[02:33:41.149 --> 02:33:42.269]  It will happen in the future.
[02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:44.311]  It's coming to a theater near you.
[02:33:44.351 --> 02:33:48.854]  And anybody that does not see it, I would ask them to do what it says in James and pray for wisdom.
[02:33:49.555 --> 02:33:55.619]  My Lord Jesus Christ, as the same Lord as Alex, will return in bodily form in the future.
[02:33:56.279 --> 02:33:58.261]  And Alex, I pray for you daily.
[02:33:58.281 --> 02:33:59.102]  I will continue to.
[02:33:59.602 --> 02:34:03.845]  I'm praying to protect you from the devil, a real devil, and his minions.
[02:34:05.350 --> 02:34:07.212]  All right, well, thank you so much for the call.
[02:34:07.432 --> 02:34:08.453]  John Anderson?
[02:34:09.294 --> 02:34:10.935]  Well, I'll deal with the second thing first.
[02:34:11.015 --> 02:34:14.758]  Okay, number one, John 14, 19, Jesus speaking.
[02:34:14.838 --> 02:34:17.721]  Yep, a little while, and the world seeth me no more.
[02:34:18.341 --> 02:34:20.623]  But ye see me, because I live, ye shall live also.
[02:34:20.683 --> 02:34:22.805]  Two verses later, in verse 22, Judas not Iscariot...
[02:34:24.187 --> 02:34:24.588]  Speaking.
[02:34:24.608 --> 02:34:28.972]  He says, Lord, how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not to the world?
[02:34:29.273 --> 02:34:30.094]  That's number one.
[02:34:30.134 --> 02:34:37.041]  Number two, it's interesting to jump to Revelation 13 to try to get something going, but let's go back to Revelation chapter 1.
[02:34:37.884 --> 02:34:43.769]  The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass.
[02:34:43.789 --> 02:34:44.429]  Well, listen, Rob.
[02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:46.451]  Revelation 3, the time is at hand.
[02:34:46.531 --> 02:34:47.692]  Hold on.
[02:34:48.312 --> 02:34:57.339]  Where was the mark to buy and sell this king, the ten kings, the multi-million man armies?
[02:34:57.419 --> 02:34:58.820]  Where is it?
[02:34:59.180 --> 02:35:01.242]  First of all, there's no multi-million man armies in there.
[02:35:01.302 --> 02:35:02.623]  That is something that is ready.
[02:35:02.683 --> 02:35:03.303]  Manufactured?
[02:35:03.383 --> 02:35:03.704]  Okay.
[02:35:03.764 --> 02:35:03.944]  Yes.
[02:35:04.697 --> 02:35:16.263]  Number two, yes, during the time of the Roman Empire, if you were part of the church, the ecclesia, the called out ones, you did not, if you paid homage to Caesar, you were in serious trouble.
[02:35:17.183 --> 02:35:27.528]  If you did not have the mark or the phylacteries, if you will, you were then immediately identified as one of those radicals following Jesus Christ.
[02:35:28.476 --> 02:35:35.878]  So therefore, the mark, if you will, it's like Jesus said, hey, my kids are marked, but it wasn't a computer chip.
[02:35:35.918 --> 02:35:36.558]  Hey, hold on.
[02:35:36.578 --> 02:35:38.659]  It says a mark in the forehead or hand.
[02:35:38.899 --> 02:35:39.219]  Yes.
[02:35:39.939 --> 02:35:40.239]  So?
[02:35:40.539 --> 02:35:42.980]  And he marks his as well.
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:44.260]  No, no, no.
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:48.081]  Now listen, that's written literally, a mark in the hand or the head.
[02:35:48.241 --> 02:35:50.062]  There's nothing about a computer chip.
[02:35:50.746 --> 02:35:57.168]  And the point is that every futurist misses out there and chooses to ignore is Revelation 1-3, the time is at hand.
[02:35:57.508 --> 02:36:03.109]  Revelation 22-10, don't seal up the vision because the time is at hand.
[02:36:03.149 --> 02:36:12.092]  Those are bookends that it was getting ready to transpire and did and culminated in 70 AD, of September 70 AD, just exactly on time.
[02:36:12.112 --> 02:36:14.472]  Hey, I bet you're going to be wound up on your show today.
[02:36:14.512 --> 02:36:16.013]  Are you on the air today?
[02:36:16.073 --> 02:36:16.273]  Yes.
[02:36:16.872 --> 02:36:18.133]  Okay, we'll talk about that in a minute.
[02:36:18.333 --> 02:36:18.693]  Okay.
[02:36:19.253 --> 02:36:23.195]  Just real quick with these calls, because I do have some news I've got to hit on that we missed in the first second hour.
[02:36:24.396 --> 02:36:29.518]  Let's talk to Sam in Missouri.
[02:36:29.578 --> 02:36:30.299]  Sam, go ahead.
[02:36:31.239 --> 02:36:34.341]  Yes, I'll make this real brief.
[02:36:34.461 --> 02:36:44.966]  The problem, among other things, that I have with the Preterist view is that in Revelation 21, I would say start at least chapters 2 and go through 4.
[02:36:47.582 --> 02:36:53.686]  If this had truly happened, my question is, why do we still have sorrow and crying and pain?
[02:36:53.746 --> 02:37:01.450]  Because it says in Chapter 4 that God will wipe away all their tears and there will be no more sorrow, crying, or pain.
[02:37:02.771 --> 02:37:04.312]  Exactly, and that's an excellent question.
[02:37:04.372 --> 02:37:05.553]  I'm glad that you brought it up.
[02:37:05.653 --> 02:37:07.434]  As I said before earlier in the program,
[02:37:08.092 --> 02:37:11.235]  Let's go past that to Revelation 22, verse 15.
[02:37:11.315 --> 02:37:14.219]  First of all, he's dealing with his children, and that's absolutely true.
[02:37:14.599 --> 02:37:18.643]  Blessed are they, sermon on the mount, blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
[02:37:18.803 --> 02:37:19.644]  Were they mourning about?
[02:37:19.844 --> 02:37:23.428]  They came to realize how far off they were from Almighty God.
[02:37:23.849 --> 02:37:30.295]  Revelation 22, verse 15 says, After this new heaven and earth, if you will, outside that kingdom...
[02:37:31.815 --> 02:37:38.040]  To be established are the dogs, the sorcerers, the homebuggers, the murderers, the adulterers, and whoso love and maketh a lie.
[02:37:38.780 --> 02:37:46.586]  Even if you are a futurist, after it's all transpired from your perspective, you still have that going on outside the kingdom because it's the spiritual kingdom.
[02:37:46.847 --> 02:37:48.908]  It was never ever going to be physical and literal.
[02:37:49.228 --> 02:37:51.810]  That's a mistake that they made in 1 Samuel 8.
[02:37:51.931 --> 02:37:52.831]  Read it for yourself.
[02:37:53.392 --> 02:37:56.074]  And it's the same thing that the church has made a mistake on today.
[02:37:56.094 --> 02:37:58.956]  I'm sorry, but that's the way the cookie crumbles.
[02:38:00.237 --> 02:38:00.677]  All right.
[02:38:00.777 --> 02:38:01.558]  Let me
[02:38:02.256 --> 02:38:02.877]  Go ahead, Sam.
[02:38:02.917 --> 02:38:07.142]  The thing is, what's the good news?
[02:38:07.522 --> 02:38:08.223]  What's the gospel?
[02:38:08.263 --> 02:38:09.004]  What's the good news?
[02:38:09.625 --> 02:38:11.246]  Okay, the good news is very simple.
[02:38:11.367 --> 02:38:15.952]  God said what he was going to do for almost 1,500 years through a couple of dozen different prophets.
[02:38:16.556 --> 02:38:16.996]  We're good to go.
[02:38:46.997 --> 02:38:48.979]  Therefore, I cannot serve two masters.
[02:38:49.059 --> 02:38:52.581]  I cannot be citizens of this world, nor the citizen of heaven.
[02:38:53.002 --> 02:38:57.726]  And I have already been judged, and I am now in his government.
[02:38:57.866 --> 02:39:02.069]  But look, the system is still coming against you for not having their driver's license.
[02:39:02.109 --> 02:39:03.450]  But Jesus says they will.
[02:39:03.510 --> 02:39:05.952]  They will hate you for my allegiance to whom?
[02:39:05.972 --> 02:39:06.613]  Him.
[02:39:07.113 --> 02:39:07.553]  To him.
[02:39:07.633 --> 02:39:11.737]  Therefore, I am persecuted for my faith.
[02:39:11.757 --> 02:39:13.678]  Let's cram a few more calls in here just real quick.
[02:39:13.698 --> 02:39:14.479]  Who's up next, Mark?
[02:39:16.024 --> 02:39:16.944]  Who should I go to next?
[02:39:18.005 --> 02:39:19.445]  Leslie in Virginia, go ahead.
[02:39:19.465 --> 02:39:21.246]  Hello?
[02:39:21.566 --> 02:39:21.846]  Yes.
[02:39:22.847 --> 02:39:26.488]  Well, in reference to Romans 13, I'll make this quick.
[02:39:26.808 --> 02:39:44.215]  You know, in Daniel, they've agreed, you know, people think the prayer was taken out with Madam O'Hare, but the prayer was not instituted in Daniel there, chapter 6, verse 2, when King Darius wanted Daniel to be over the citizenry there.
[02:39:44.415 --> 02:39:45.375]  And they plotted...
[02:39:45.936 --> 02:39:48.438]  And, of course, they couldn't pray, but Daniel did anyway.
[02:39:48.598 --> 02:39:49.819]  They threw him in the lion's den.
[02:39:50.700 --> 02:40:05.712]  And 1 Peter 5.28, the authorities there forbade Peter and the apostles there to preach Jesus, but they said we'd rather obey God than man.
[02:40:07.334 --> 02:40:10.476]  You're talking about Romans 13, which is how all this started.
[02:40:10.697 --> 02:40:12.078]  How the church today...
[02:40:14.837 --> 02:40:16.519]  Right.
[02:40:17.140 --> 02:40:22.566]  And resistance to tyranny is obedience to God, and John Fox, author of the Fox Book of Martyrs, stated that.
[02:40:22.586 --> 02:40:26.070]  That was about 87 million martyrs to prove it.
[02:40:26.671 --> 02:40:28.893]  Yeah, well, I mean, I'm just talking about our scriptures.
[02:40:28.953 --> 02:40:33.378]  I mean, if we've got discernment, and if it don't call us to God's Word...
[02:40:34.366 --> 02:40:35.267]  Well, that's right.
[02:40:35.307 --> 02:40:36.108]  We resist these things.
[02:40:36.448 --> 02:40:41.573]  And, you know, resistance to tyranny is as simple as that and is obedience to God.
[02:40:41.833 --> 02:40:48.660]  And Pastor Paul dealt with the corruption of Scripture in 2 Corinthians 2.17 when he said, We are not as many which do corrupt the word of God.
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:51.142]  So they dealt with the same problem then.
[02:40:51.542 --> 02:40:51.943]  All right.
[02:40:51.983 --> 02:40:53.304]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:53.324 --> 02:40:54.305]  I really appreciate it.
[02:40:54.325 --> 02:40:54.805]  God let you go.
[02:40:54.825 --> 02:40:55.466]  And I'm sorry.
[02:40:56.026 --> 02:40:57.087]  We've got loaded phones.
[02:40:57.148 --> 02:40:58.229]  No more time for calls.
[02:40:59.715 --> 02:41:10.198]  Again, this is a news program, and I just think it's very important to address this because the Romans 13 is clear, and I agree with our guest on that, that it's been twisted, and that's big news.
[02:41:10.538 --> 02:41:16.499]  On the other side of the break, I'm just going to spend a minute or two with our guests so they can tell you about their websites, phone numbers, information like that.
[02:41:16.939 --> 02:41:22.221]  Then I'm going to try to shotgun through some other key news of the day, which is important.
[02:41:22.341 --> 02:41:26.882]  We've got to point out the pitfalls that are out there, what's developing, what's on the horizon.
[02:41:28.453 --> 02:41:29.254]  What's in the backyard?
[02:41:29.294 --> 02:41:30.234]  What's in our living rooms?
[02:41:31.295 --> 02:41:32.375]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:32.535 --> 02:41:33.516]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:41:36.978 --> 02:41:39.900]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:41:40.580 --> 02:41:41.861]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:41:42.061 --> 02:41:47.804]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:41:48.084 --> 02:41:53.347]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:41:53.628 --> 02:41:57.750]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:41:57.910 --> 02:42:01.735]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:42:01.995 --> 02:42:06.621]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:42:06.701 --> 02:42:12.989]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:42:13.029 --> 02:42:14.791]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:42:15.311 --> 02:42:17.413]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[02:42:17.493 --> 02:42:21.755]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:42:29.140 --> 02:42:31.121]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[02:42:31.361 --> 02:42:32.862]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:42:33.063 --> 02:42:35.124]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:42:35.896 --> 02:42:37.877]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:42:37.957 --> 02:42:38.617]  Hello, folks.
[02:42:38.737 --> 02:42:48.661]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:42:49.041 --> 02:42:53.563]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:42:53.623 --> 02:43:04.967]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:43:05.387 --> 02:43:06.027]  We're good to go.
[02:43:28.035 --> 02:43:31.265]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:43:31.506 --> 02:43:32.308]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:43:36.585 --> 02:43:37.606]  Let the experts at startovertoday.com
[02:44:04.884 --> 02:44:05.504]  We're good to go.
[02:44:33.559 --> 02:44:35.319]  Don't consolidate, eliminate.
[02:44:41.201 --> 02:44:43.101]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:44:43.601 --> 02:44:46.422]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:48.363 --> 02:44:51.603]  Folks, we'll be back tonight from 9 to midnight.
[02:44:52.203 --> 02:44:54.424]  Central Standard Time right here on this network.
[02:44:56.170 --> 02:45:06.096]  On the AM and FM dials, simulcasting on Global Shortwave at 5.085 and 6890, and the Internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:45:07.797 --> 02:45:12.020]  And I just wanted to have these guys on to talk about their ideas.
[02:45:12.700 --> 02:45:14.381]  I heard them on the radio yesterday.
[02:45:14.401 --> 02:45:19.064]  Again, I don't normally get off into all these debates about
[02:45:19.835 --> 02:45:27.740]  The Bible and Scripture, because it turns into just a giant quagmire of arguing and people having their own views.
[02:45:28.661 --> 02:45:34.825]  I think it's up to individuals to test the Word of God themselves and use discernment, and I'm still studying it.
[02:45:35.765 --> 02:45:38.227]  But it is very interesting, and I appreciate our guests coming on.
[02:45:38.247 --> 02:45:45.612]  We've had a bunch of preachers who called in, I found out, but didn't want to be on air at this time, who wanted to officially debate you guys.
[02:45:46.172 --> 02:45:49.354]  And I know, John Anderson, that you do that quite a bit, don't you?
[02:45:49.887 --> 02:46:03.640]  Yes, as a matter of fact, anyone out there that's listening to what we have to say, if you have an audience, and this is not just for somebody to come on the broadcast because you don't like what I'm saying, but if you want to call our toll-free number and leave your name and address, I will be happy to call you back.
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:06.924]  And yes, you can come on our program and we can do a formal debate.
[02:46:07.824 --> 02:46:10.187]  The idea is to bring light, not heat.
[02:46:10.507 --> 02:46:11.328]  And that is the point.
[02:46:11.448 --> 02:46:14.351]  Our thrust, Alex, is to get people back into God's Word.
[02:46:15.203 --> 02:46:17.904]  And get into the original and study it for themselves.
[02:46:18.004 --> 02:46:20.184]  Don't take my word for it or anybody else's.
[02:46:20.765 --> 02:46:22.525]  I'm a signpost pointing you back to it.
[02:46:22.985 --> 02:46:25.226]  Because it has to be Scripture and Scripture alone.
[02:46:25.306 --> 02:46:27.446]  Dan, your show's on from what, 3 to 4?
[02:46:27.886 --> 02:46:35.729]  Yes, we're on 3 to 4 East Coast Time, The Voice of Reason, Monday through Friday, and also 7 to 9 East Coast Time on Sunday evenings.
[02:46:35.889 --> 02:46:39.810]  And Alex, I thank you for allowing us to be on your program.
[02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:40.070]  Thank you.
[02:46:40.490 --> 02:46:40.850]  You bet.
[02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:43.191]  Paul Revere, any closing comments on your website?
[02:46:43.971 --> 02:46:44.231]  Yeah.
[02:46:45.365 --> 02:46:51.910]  Our website, specifically dealing with Romans 13, is Romans13.EmbassyOfHeaven.com.
[02:46:51.990 --> 02:46:54.753]  That's Romans13.EmbassyOfHeaven.com.
[02:46:55.453 --> 02:46:57.995]  I do have a final comment I'll try to quickly make.
[02:46:59.396 --> 02:47:04.160]  Alex, you had stated about all the confusion, especially all these churches and what they preach.
[02:47:04.220 --> 02:47:12.667]  Well, if we take a look at the logic behind what's happened, almost all the churches that go by the name church are state corporations.
[02:47:13.171 --> 02:47:14.812]  The head of their church is not Jesus Christ.
[02:47:14.852 --> 02:47:18.013]  The head of their church is a state attorney general through incorporation.
[02:47:18.433 --> 02:47:19.413]  Oh, so that's true.
[02:47:19.453 --> 02:47:19.833]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:47:19.853 --> 02:47:20.974]  Therefore, they're going to preach.
[02:47:21.174 --> 02:47:26.475]  They're going to preach from a statist viewpoint, not from an ecclesiastical viewpoint, because they've got a contradiction.
[02:47:26.495 --> 02:47:36.939]  You've got to remember that Jesus was an enemy of both the state of Rome and what would be known as the church or the synagogue, which is the Pharisees.
[02:47:36.999 --> 02:47:42.901]  He was the enemy of both church and state, which we at the Embassy of Heaven also find ourselves as enemies
[02:47:47.255 --> 02:47:52.863]  For those who don't know, that's the founding father's term for the institution of the established churches, is church.
[02:47:53.650 --> 02:47:55.292]  Okay, well, gentlemen, thanks for coming on.
[02:47:55.532 --> 02:47:57.934]  Well, thank you so much, Alex, for this invitation.
[02:47:58.114 --> 02:47:58.314]  You bet.
[02:47:58.334 --> 02:47:58.855]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:47:59.215 --> 02:48:00.176]  Take care, John Anderson.
[02:48:00.676 --> 02:48:01.497]  I'm out of time.
[02:48:01.777 --> 02:48:02.938]  Explosions rocked U.S.
[02:48:03.018 --> 02:48:03.679]  Iraq base.
[02:48:03.699 --> 02:48:05.080]  I already mentioned this, but it's important.
[02:48:05.540 --> 02:48:07.222]  Six huge explosions rocked U.S.
[02:48:07.262 --> 02:48:11.966]  military base west of Baghdad overnight as mysterious assailants fired on the compound.
[02:48:12.046 --> 02:48:15.049]  And my witness said, military won't say if more troops died.
[02:48:15.089 --> 02:48:16.150]  I hope that's not the case.
[02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:21.194]  British soldiers face wrath of Iraqis as hatred festers on streets of Basra.
[02:48:22.017 --> 02:48:26.280]  Order has not been brought back to the country, and that's why things are disintegrating, my friends.
[02:48:27.601 --> 02:48:50.235]  Also, there's a bunch of other news articles on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, like this BBC news story, superbugs spread into community, antibiotic-resistant superbugs are spreading into the community, experts have warned, and it's a lot more serious than West Nile virus, which has now killed a couple more people in Colorado, which is terrible.
[02:48:51.747 --> 02:49:04.057]  Doctors are now seeing urinary tract infections, which cannot be treated with the standard medications because they are caused by drug-resistant strains of E. coli bacteria, a major cause of UTIs.
[02:49:06.078 --> 02:49:10.982]  But patriots 20 years ago were kooks for warning you not to take antibiotics for no reason.
[02:49:11.662 --> 02:49:16.626]  And now you've got superbugs that eat your skin off, and there's tens of thousands of cases a year.
[02:49:17.147 --> 02:49:18.508]  Why isn't that bigger news?
[02:49:19.935 --> 02:49:22.840]  Again, back tomorrow, 11 to 2, back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:25.605]  We'll be right back tonight, so join us again.
[02:49:26.426 --> 02:49:32.636]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:49:33.338 --> 02:49:37.144]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most...
