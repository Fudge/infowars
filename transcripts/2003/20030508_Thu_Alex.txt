[00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:07.467]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:15.676]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:17.417]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:19.219]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:20.621]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:22.297]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.317 --> 00:00:26.918]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:31.279]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.321]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:43.402]  Welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:44.183 --> 00:00:45.983]  It is Thursday, the 8th.
[00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:51.703]  Of May 2003, we'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.903 --> 00:00:55.525]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 9 p.m.
[00:00:55.565 --> 00:01:00.747]  to 12 midnight Central Standard Time, and of course the daytime show from 11 a.m.
[00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:02.108]  until 2 p.m.
[00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:03.268]  Central Standard Time.
[00:01:03.308 --> 00:01:07.630]  We go out on a growing list of wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.773]  We simulcast on the Internet at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:21.663]  And simulcast on Global Shortwave during the day 11 to 2 at 12.172 and 93.20 and at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:23.705]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.793]  I have a guest coming on today to talk about the neighborhood that got raided by 50 militarized police and large armored vehicles.
[00:01:40.153 --> 00:01:41.574]  No drugs were found.
[00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:43.194]  No one broke any laws.
[00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:44.975]  They were still arrested.
[00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:48.336]  That's right, the new America.
[00:01:49.336 --> 00:01:57.559]  And the police don't like being shown up, so they're going to go ahead and asset forfeiture, seize, despite the fact that nothing illegal was found.
[00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.860]  Welcome to your new freedom.
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.821]  We need Operation American Freedom, don't we?
[00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:04.701]  But don't look for it coming from the government.
[00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:11.564]  Amazing articles out of the New York Times, out of the New Yorker, out of the Asian Times.
[00:02:12.624 --> 00:02:21.767]  Neocons dance to a Strauss waltz, and it turns out Mr. Strauss was a believer in dictatorships and tyranny, did not believe in republics or freedom.
[00:02:22.588 --> 00:02:25.749]  And funny, we had Stanley Hilton, the lawyer...
[00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:34.131]  Bob Dole, former chief of staff, suing the government for being involved in 9-1-1, not for having prior knowledge, but for being involved.
[00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:49.156]  And he said he went to the Chicago University up there in Chicago, went to school with all these guys, and mentioned on this show the followers of Strauss, and saying that's what the neocons really were.
[00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:51.697]  And here it is in the mainstream news.
[00:02:52.452 --> 00:02:55.354]  Of course, these are just a management team, folks.
[00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:57.215]  They're not the reason all this is happening.
[00:02:57.535 --> 00:03:13.423]  They're just one of the little cabals, one of the power teams, one of the management teams the globalists have brought in right now to finally deep-six what's left of the republic in your liberties to get your guns, to get your private property, to bring you into the New World Order.
[00:03:13.803 --> 00:03:17.145]  As Knight Ritter News Service newspapers said on Monday...
[00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:20.288]  It's a new world order.
[00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:24.392]  The neocons call for a new world order.
[00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:26.955]  So we'll get into that.
[00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:29.738]  Also, new fears over toxic vaccines.
[00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:32.721]  This out of the London Standard, the Evening Standard.
[00:03:33.742 --> 00:03:34.903]  And on top of it,
[00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.859]  It's now coming out that what may have killed that NBC reporter was his smallpox injection.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.242]  So see, it's mainstream.
[00:03:45.303 --> 00:03:48.227]  These vaccines are deadly.
[00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:50.669]  You don't have to take them.
[00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:58.176]  But the government's trying to set a precedent that you do by saying, oh, you're crazy if you don't.
[00:03:58.216 --> 00:04:09.025]  Well, I guess then 99 plus percent of doctors, police, and firemen are crazy because 99 percent plus have refused to take it.
[00:04:09.385 --> 00:04:12.528]  But David Bloom didn't, and he's bye-bye'd.
[00:04:13.303 --> 00:04:16.308]  And many others that are taking it are bye-bye.
[00:04:16.388 --> 00:04:20.295]  It looks like more than one out of a thousand die that take it.
[00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.411]  We're good to go.
[00:04:44.592 --> 00:04:51.617]  And they want to create this new Homeland Security office to forcibly inject you with at least 10 bioweapon vaccines.
[00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:52.637]  Mmm, yummy!
[00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:53.818]  Wonder what else?
[00:04:54.218 --> 00:04:59.782]  Wonder what other type of goodies are in it from the eugenics neocons?
[00:05:01.603 --> 00:05:02.604]  All coming up.
[00:05:02.784 --> 00:05:04.885]  Big, big show.
[00:05:05.446 --> 00:05:06.326]  Multiple guests.
[00:05:06.426 --> 00:05:07.007]  Your calls.
[00:05:07.087 --> 00:05:07.767]  A ton of news.
[00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:08.488]  Stay with me.
[00:05:12.114 --> 00:05:15.756]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[00:05:15.896 --> 00:05:20.278]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[00:05:20.478 --> 00:05:24.940]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.102]  There are no moving parts, and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[00:05:28.382 --> 00:05:33.004]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[00:05:33.284 --> 00:05:37.126]  Made of the finest materials, it has a 2-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:39.807]  And the Aaronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:43.988]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:49.410]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds, and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.551]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[00:05:52.712 --> 00:05:54.592]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:57.473]  For more information about the Aaronizer, call toll-free.
[00:05:57.713 --> 00:05:59.414]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[00:05:59.634 --> 00:06:02.815]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[00:06:03.215 --> 00:06:06.237]  That's 877-605-9200.
[00:06:06.597 --> 00:06:17.801]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:18.061 --> 00:06:22.803]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:23.023 --> 00:06:28.665]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:29.626]  We're good to go.
[00:06:45.523 --> 00:06:48.045]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:06:48.265 --> 00:06:55.029]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:06:55.229 --> 00:07:00.472]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:00.492 --> 00:07:00.892]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.131]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.

[00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:06.291]  GCNlive.com.
[00:08:06.331 --> 00:08:07.112]  Bookmark it today.
[00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:16.409]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.852 --> 00:08:23.415]  All right, I say this very often, but I really mean it today.
[00:08:23.576 --> 00:08:27.800]  I'm going to go to calls early in this first hour.
[00:08:29.346 --> 00:08:33.187]  The toll-free number to join us on air today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:33.207 --> 00:08:33.387]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:35.167]  I'll get you up and on the air.
[00:08:35.187 --> 00:08:36.168]  Again, that's 800-259-9231.
[00:08:36.208 --> 00:08:36.968]  We talk about freedom.
[00:08:37.068 --> 00:08:38.968]  We talk about liberty on this show.
[00:08:55.074 --> 00:08:55.794]  We're good to go.
[00:08:55.814 --> 00:08:56.515]  I think?
[00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:15.722]  And we stand firmly against it.
[00:09:15.762 --> 00:09:25.526]  We bring forward the evidence to you, a growing audience of millions, every single day, Monday through Friday, and I even do a Saturday show now from 1 to 4 p.m.
[00:09:25.546 --> 00:09:26.386]  with John Stattmiller.
[00:09:26.707 --> 00:09:28.748]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:35.090]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:43.214]  If the world doesn't make sense to you, if you wonder why you keep losing your liberties and more and more factories are shutting down and why the borders are still wide open
[00:09:43.614 --> 00:09:48.358]  As the government tells you to give up liberty for security, you'll find the answers right here.
[00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:59.868]  You wonder why our government creates Saddam Hussein's and creates bin Laden's and arms North Korea's and engages the American people in these costly and dangerous wars?
[00:10:00.188 --> 00:10:01.870]  You'll find the answers right here.
[00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:11.898]  You're wondering why police are running checkpoints and why there's cameras everywhere and why your children are being trained how to turn you in for owning guns when your guns aren't even illegal.
[00:10:12.298 --> 00:10:15.901]  You'll find the answers right here on this show.
[00:10:17.422 --> 00:10:23.167]  Coming up in the next hour, Eugene police illegally raid homes with a tank prompts federal lawsuit.
[00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:26.892]  Eugene, police illegally raid homes with a tank.
[00:10:27.173 --> 00:10:28.253]  Prompts federal lawsuit.
[00:10:28.994 --> 00:10:33.256]  And wild stuff comes out of Oregon, but it's happening all over the country.
[00:10:34.097 --> 00:10:41.001]  Tanks, 50 police, multiple agencies, federal, state, local, large armored vehicles.
[00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:42.301]  These are the big ones.
[00:10:43.702 --> 00:10:49.265]  They went ahead and decided to raid multiple homes, hoarding off the neighborhood.
[00:10:49.285 --> 00:10:51.927]  In the last four years, I've seen these headlines from Missouri,
[00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:58.055]  And from Virginia, where they raid whole neighborhoods.
[00:10:58.095 --> 00:11:01.763]  In fact, in one town in Missouri a couple years ago, the AP reported on it.
[00:11:02.424 --> 00:11:04.448]  The headline was, Town Search.
[00:11:05.416 --> 00:11:06.197]  We're good to go.
[00:11:29.716 --> 00:11:37.939]  The founding fathers expressly said, no troops on the streets engaging in peace officer or law enforcement behavior.
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.121]  The 1878 law restricted it even further.
[00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:50.064]  It said this is a massive prison time and massive fines for any public officials or any military engaged in this.
[00:11:50.124 --> 00:11:58.968]  So the government in the 60s started militarizing our police, giving them CIA control out in L.A., made that the training module for all the other departments involved,
[00:12:00.049 --> 00:12:05.517]  Now they're talking publicly about getting rid of posse comandantes, putting troops on the streets, but the border stays wide open.
[00:12:05.577 --> 00:12:06.418]  Why is that bad?
[00:12:06.478 --> 00:12:13.969]  Well, on the face of it, Guatemala, Russia, China, famously corrupt countries have troops on the streets.
[00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:23.296]  You know, when you go rent a movie like The Running Man or Escape from New York, you know, those 80s movies where they would picture futuristic tyrannies.
[00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:27.079]  There were troops on the streets, to give you a Hollywood analogy.
[00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:30.602]  But in the real world, Saddam Hussein had troops on the streets.
[00:12:31.122 --> 00:12:35.946]  Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Mao Zedong, and now it's coming here.
[00:12:37.248 --> 00:12:38.709]  And what are the troops being trained?
[00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:40.110]  How are they being trained?
[00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.211]  Well, we have them on tape.
[00:12:41.491 --> 00:12:42.732]  We have their training manuals.
[00:12:42.772 --> 00:12:43.972]  We have FEMA on video.
[00:12:44.212 --> 00:12:47.294]  The police, military, and others across the board.
[00:12:47.895 --> 00:12:54.099]  Christians, gun owners, homeschoolers, constitutionalists, those that, quote, talk about posse commentatus.
[00:12:54.619 --> 00:13:01.664]  I have police training files, some of the newest, put out in 2002, sent to me by, well, one particular federal marshal.
[00:13:02.884 --> 00:13:05.446]  The official documents, the official disc,
[00:13:06.403 --> 00:13:14.346]  Where it lists, if people talk about posse commentatus, that's a code word for terrorism against police.
[00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:16.526]  I mean, think of the brainwashing there.
[00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:29.150]  So you're at a checkpoint, and there's troops searching vehicles, which they're starting to do all over the country, and you say, officer, posse commentatus, they pull their gun, they freak out, you've just said a code word.
[00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.691]  No, you were educated.
[00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:32.547]  Maybe you read history books.
[00:13:32.587 --> 00:13:34.467]  Maybe you went to college and took history.
[00:13:34.807 --> 00:13:37.008]  You knew we had a law against this.
[00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:39.069]  You'd read the newspaper and heard about this.
[00:13:39.469 --> 00:13:44.631]  But the cop they know hasn't and has been brainwashed.
[00:13:45.431 --> 00:13:47.112]  It's unbelievable.
[00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.983]  And you're thinking, oh, that's not going to happen.
[00:13:50.003 --> 00:14:00.913]  We have footage from before 9-1-1 of a housewife, no criminal record, Navy veteran, at a checkpoint saying, no, you can't search my car, no, you don't get my information, you've got to have probable cause.
[00:14:00.953 --> 00:14:07.840]  They jerk her out, they arrest her, they find a pocket constitution, and on videotape, with the microphones on their...
[00:14:09.173 --> 00:14:18.035]  Little ties that they use to try to frame you, they got themselves in deep water as they began to discuss, is the Constitution illegal?
[00:14:18.515 --> 00:14:20.635]  Is she allowed to have this information?
[00:14:21.255 --> 00:14:22.416]  And that's in the road to tyranny.
[00:14:24.216 --> 00:14:30.057]  So this is the new America, folks, and they've been doing this quietly, and it didn't go away under Hare Bush.
[00:14:30.197 --> 00:14:32.218]  It has exploded under Bush.
[00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:33.918]  It's crazy.
[00:14:33.938 --> 00:14:34.578]  It's crazy.
[00:14:35.694 --> 00:14:35.894]  I think.
[00:14:35.914 --> 00:14:36.074]  I think.
[00:14:51.451 --> 00:14:52.651]  We're attacking all these countries.
[00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:53.931]  We're taking our rights away.
[00:14:54.432 --> 00:15:02.373]  All we do is remember Bush's senior speeches and all the other speeches by Clinton and others and the public announcements for a world government.
[00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:06.054]  See how they're trying to neutralize political debate and resistance?
[00:15:07.434 --> 00:15:19.436]  You know, I finally got a tape of that Spice Girls show they did on national television where they, for 30 minutes, had old women and people saying, I think they ought to kill them, strap them to a bomb and drop them on Baghdad.
[00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.311]  That old woman should be arrested.
[00:15:22.351 --> 00:15:24.032]  She's threatening people's lives.
[00:15:24.452 --> 00:15:25.312]  But it's okay.
[00:15:25.732 --> 00:15:27.433]  National TV, announce it.
[00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.914]  And regardless of whether you're for the war or against it.
[00:15:30.374 --> 00:15:30.794]  Okay?
[00:15:32.215 --> 00:15:35.036]  Regardless of that, you know, there is a thing called the First Amendment.
[00:15:35.076 --> 00:15:37.657]  We went out to a rally a few months ago, a pro-Bush rally.
[00:15:37.677 --> 00:15:38.438]  We have tape of it.
[00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.839]  And there was only about 20 people there.
[00:15:42.899 --> 00:15:46.281]  And a guy ran up to the cameraman and said, Are you with Alex Jones?
[00:15:47.353 --> 00:15:48.014]  He's bad.
[00:15:48.055 --> 00:15:53.845]  If you're not for Bush, I'm going to bleep your hind end right in front of police and begin screaming.
[00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.292]  I mean, it's insanity.
[00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:59.955]  And DJs are suspended if they air Spice Girls?
[00:16:00.035 --> 00:16:02.217]  Is that what America is about?
[00:16:02.257 --> 00:16:17.351]  Where big corporations publicly put out memos saying, support the president, support the war, don't criticize any policy of the president, don't play any music, any anti-war music, don't play anyone who ever said they were against the war.
[00:16:17.832 --> 00:16:20.014]  That's about creating a chilling effect.
[00:16:20.643 --> 00:16:23.206]  Is that what our veterans fought and died for?
[00:16:23.526 --> 00:16:28.230]  The answer is a resounding no, and you know it out there.
[00:16:29.391 --> 00:16:35.857]  Incidentally, all this neocon fascism is energizing the left wing like never before.
[00:16:36.158 --> 00:16:41.563]  The left wing was losing its grassroots converts for gun grabbing, for environmental foot soldier land grabbers.
[00:16:41.823 --> 00:16:44.786]  They were losing their foot soldiers to real conservatism.
[00:16:45.564 --> 00:16:45.924]  Okay?
[00:16:46.465 --> 00:16:51.329]  Because of the folks like myself out there evangelizing them to be constitutionalists.
[00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:57.735]  There has been the biggest socialist energizing effect I've ever seen under Bush.
[00:16:57.775 --> 00:17:02.659]  So, it's taken the neocons, it's taken the conservatives into the neocon big government camp.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.544]  The liberals are being energized for their big government putsch at the grassroots level.
[00:17:08.371 --> 00:17:16.255]  And the average conservative is driving along giggling, listening to the neocons on the radio, who are the most big government socialistic creatures you can imagine.
[00:17:16.956 --> 00:17:37.166]  By the way, we had Dennis Cuddy, Ph.D., high-level Department of Education, best-selling author on yesterday, and he talked about the public announcements of the big neocon magazines publicly founded by Trotskyites, by the most hardcore commies you can imagine, publicly!
[00:17:38.172 --> 00:17:38.692]  Understand.
[00:17:39.032 --> 00:17:40.693]  Pub, lick, leave.
[00:17:41.574 --> 00:17:42.914]  The crystals and the rest of them.
[00:17:45.095 --> 00:17:47.556]  And, you know, he talked about that.
[00:17:47.996 --> 00:17:48.797]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:17:48.817 --> 00:17:49.297]  Well, here it is.
[00:17:50.593 --> 00:17:52.995]  Neocons dance a Strauss waltz.
[00:17:53.115 --> 00:18:02.063]  Washington is United States foreign policy being run by followers of an obscure German political philosopher whose views were elitist, amoral, and hostile to the democratic government.
[00:18:02.443 --> 00:18:06.707]  Suddenly political Washington is abuzz about Leo Strauss, who arrived in the U.S.
[00:18:06.847 --> 00:18:10.030]  in 1938 and taught at several major universities before his death in 1973.
[00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:15.470]  Following recent articles in the U.S.
[00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:35.900]  press, as reported in the Asia Times, this war is brought to you by, in March, are becoming aware that the key neoconservative strategists behind the Bush administration's aggressive foreign and military policy consider themselves to be followers of Strauss, although the philosopher and expert on Plato and Aristotle rarely addressed current events in his writings.
[00:18:37.421 --> 00:18:39.702]  And the guy praised dictatorship.
[00:18:39.762 --> 00:18:41.083]  It's got his quotes right here.
[00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:53.391]  Praised dictatorships and came out of Nazi Germany, interestingly enough, and criticized democratic governments, republics.
[00:18:54.392 --> 00:19:00.474]  So, folks, when you hear about giving the Iraqis freedom, folks, we're losing our freedom right now.
[00:19:01.434 --> 00:19:09.416]  And I just want to remind you, in case you haven't broken your conditioning yet, Bush is about to reauthorize the assault weapons ban and the magazine ban.
[00:19:09.516 --> 00:19:11.017]  He's about to pass more gun law.
[00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:13.164]  And I just want to remind you of that.
[00:19:13.204 --> 00:19:14.965]  See, I actually believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:19:15.486 --> 00:19:16.847]  I'm not one of these neocons.
[00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:24.192]  I'm not going to sit here and make fun of Tom Daschle all day and go, oh, Bush is good, he's fighting him, when Bush is in a literal love fest with the Democratic Party.
[00:19:25.913 --> 00:19:31.377]  By the way, David Bloom's death tied to smallpox shot that's coming up, another headline, new fears over toxic vaccines.
[00:19:32.017 --> 00:19:34.399]  Yeah, we're mainstream to criticize these vaccines.
[00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:37.891]  And the controversial California gun decision stands.
[00:19:38.331 --> 00:19:39.713]  They say you have no Second Amendment.
[00:19:39.893 --> 00:19:41.234]  All guns can be banned.
[00:19:41.254 --> 00:19:42.836]  This is the Washington Times.
[00:19:44.197 --> 00:19:45.479]  All guns can be banned.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.941]  All guns can be banned.
[00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:48.722]  This is your freedom.
[00:19:48.742 --> 00:19:50.764]  This is your neocon takeover.
[00:19:52.406 --> 00:19:53.607]  And it's all coming up.
[00:19:53.687 --> 00:19:54.328]  Your calls.
[00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:59.876]  Well, take your calls on any of the issues I just raised when we get back at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:59.896 --> 00:19:59.976]  800-259-9231.
[00:20:00.036 --> 00:20:00.316]  Infowars.com.
[00:20:10.473 --> 00:20:14.054]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:15.734]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:17.635]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:20:17.915 --> 00:20:23.076]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:20:23.456 --> 00:20:27.917]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:20:28.237 --> 00:20:36.879]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:20:37.379 --> 00:20:38.520]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.764]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:20:43.044 --> 00:20:49.669]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[00:20:50.009 --> 00:20:54.053]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[00:20:54.473 --> 00:20:56.455]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.

[00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:15.430]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.894]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:20.174 --> 00:21:20.735]  We listened.
[00:21:21.035 --> 00:21:26.020]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:26.781]  We listened.
[00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:30.224]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:30.645 --> 00:21:31.165]  We listened.
[00:21:31.626 --> 00:21:34.989]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during public
[00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.589]  We're good to go.
[00:22:01.523 --> 00:22:03.304]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:03.944 --> 00:22:07.405]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:19.310]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:22:46.374 --> 00:22:47.034]  We're good to go.
[00:23:09.577 --> 00:23:11.799]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:16.583]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:23:16.863 --> 00:23:22.668]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:23:22.908 --> 00:23:26.971]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:23:27.252 --> 00:23:32.456]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:23:32.836 --> 00:23:34.177]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:37.980]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.200]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:15.203 --> 00:24:17.105]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:17.605 --> 00:24:20.468]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:34.039]  Every day I see at least 20 mainstream news articles from around the world, dozens in this country.
[00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:37.101]  I probably look at 500 articles a day, print about 80.
[00:24:39.366 --> 00:24:50.692]  And they're admitting every type of nauseous poison, bizarre accidents at vaccine plants they claim, where weird hormones get added that screw your kids up, weird toxins, not just mercury.
[00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:54.134]  And then I read an article out of Mesa, Arizona, where the family comes in.
[00:24:54.154 --> 00:24:55.414]  They have their first newborn baby.
[00:24:55.735 --> 00:24:58.956]  Don't want it to have a hepatitis B shot, one of the most dangerous, admittedly.
[00:24:59.857 --> 00:25:01.158]  And they arrest him.
[00:25:02.418 --> 00:25:03.079]  There's no law.
[00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:03.919]  They just arrest him.
[00:25:05.439 --> 00:25:07.141]  And then now I've got these headlines.
[00:25:07.561 --> 00:25:10.043]  David Bloom's death tied to smallpox shot.
[00:25:10.183 --> 00:25:14.787]  NBC correspondent possibly victim of toxic vaccine before war in Iraq.
[00:25:14.947 --> 00:25:15.728]  Lots of deaths.
[00:25:15.808 --> 00:25:17.610]  Now it's about one per thousand, folks.
[00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.092]  The London Evening Standard.
[00:25:20.232 --> 00:25:21.953]  Big major paper in England.
[00:25:22.334 --> 00:25:24.295]  New fears over toxic vaccines.
[00:25:24.335 --> 00:25:26.237]  You know, this is what I'm talking about.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:36.405]  We say there's a new world order, they announce it, and then simultaneously the law enforcement magazines say, we're crazy, it doesn't exist, as it's in dozens of papers a day.
[00:25:36.706 --> 00:25:37.226]  You understand?
[00:25:37.646 --> 00:25:41.248]  They say we're crazy and we don't want shots, there's no law, they arrest you.
[00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:43.410]  I mean, this is a new America, folks.
[00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:44.670]  A new America.
[00:25:46.651 --> 00:25:49.793]  It's just, people have no idea how bad things have gotten.
[00:25:51.394 --> 00:25:52.615]  I've got stacks of them here.
[00:25:53.937 --> 00:25:54.898]  And we're going to go over them.
[00:25:54.918 --> 00:25:56.599]  But right now, I said we go to calls early.
[00:25:56.679 --> 00:25:57.159]  We will.
[00:25:57.239 --> 00:26:00.441]  Let's go to Bob in New York, then Wyatt, Ron, and others.
[00:26:00.802 --> 00:26:01.862]  Bob, you're on the air.
[00:26:01.902 --> 00:26:02.383]  Go ahead.
[00:26:02.403 --> 00:26:04.104]  Hi, Alex.
[00:26:04.144 --> 00:26:04.564]  How are you?
[00:26:04.584 --> 00:26:05.164]  Fine, sir.
[00:26:05.184 --> 00:26:05.585]  Go ahead.
[00:26:05.905 --> 00:26:06.485]  I'll tell you what.
[00:26:06.525 --> 00:26:10.508]  You're really, I think you're doing some fantastic work here.
[00:26:11.415 --> 00:26:25.285]  Can you believe that Crystal's daddy was an admitted Trotskyite and the founders of the Weekly Standard and all these guys are big government, they follow a guy that loves fascism, they admit it, and the average conservative has no idea as Bush grabs their guns?
[00:26:25.746 --> 00:26:30.389]  You know what's amazing, Alex, is I came across, I've been studying this stuff for about eight years now.
[00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:36.294]  I came across this book called America's Secret Establishment by Anthony C. Sutton.
[00:26:36.594 --> 00:26:39.015]  He just died last year, an incredible writer.
[00:26:39.696 --> 00:26:43.358]  Unbelievable links that they make to the New World Order and Skull and Bones.
[00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:46.421]  These guys are just the scum of the earth.
[00:26:47.001 --> 00:26:50.603]  I mean, their plans are definitely not in our Constitution.
[00:26:50.623 --> 00:26:51.104]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:26:51.124 --> 00:26:53.806]  I mean, what's wrong with a $1.4 million gambling debt?
[00:26:53.846 --> 00:26:55.227]  It's all part of being virtuous.
[00:26:56.227 --> 00:26:59.870]  Hey, Alex, have you ever seen fame.org?
[00:27:00.805 --> 00:27:03.247]  Foundation for Advancement of Monetary Education.
[00:27:03.508 --> 00:27:04.128]  Yes, I have.
[00:27:04.308 --> 00:27:07.491]  It's a fantastic Dr. Edwin Vera, their scholar.
[00:27:07.852 --> 00:27:08.993]  I mean, it really spells it out.
[00:27:09.073 --> 00:27:10.514]  It's like, what the hell is a dollar?
[00:27:11.275 --> 00:27:16.140]  You know, it's like the Federal Reserve Banking System is just a sham on the American people.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.222]  And, you know, it's about the collapse.
[00:27:19.207 --> 00:27:20.068]  It's fallen down.
[00:27:20.468 --> 00:27:22.890]  Well, it's designed to collapse, to consolidate.
[00:27:22.911 --> 00:27:24.452]  I'll say it again.
[00:27:24.912 --> 00:27:32.259]  Why do they send some 18-year-old with no money a credit card every week in the mail, but if you've got money in the bank, they don't send you credit cards?
[00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:33.500]  It's about getting you in debt.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.381]  It's about control.
[00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:36.023]  They print the money out of nothing.
[00:27:36.063 --> 00:27:37.184]  It's their mode of control.
[00:27:38.064 --> 00:27:38.545]  Oh, boy.
[00:27:39.145 --> 00:27:42.789]  You know, are you familiar with the Gold Antitrust Action Committee?
[00:27:44.033 --> 00:28:03.509]  Yes, I had them on about three years ago, and again about a year ago, and they publicly documented that Alan Greenspan and others were trading gold amongst the central banks at lower prices to lower the price of gold so that they could blow out all the gold mining companies so they could buy them up and create a semi-monopoly like De Beers.
[00:28:03.949 --> 00:28:04.449]  Oh, boy.
[00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.673]  You know, what's even far more fascinating in all of this is...
[00:28:09.215 --> 00:28:11.956]  You know, I read the Secret Establishment.
[00:28:12.096 --> 00:28:15.197]  You know, it really opened up a whole bunch of channels for me.
[00:28:15.637 --> 00:28:18.138]  And I suggest that, like, you know, everybody pick it up.
[00:28:18.218 --> 00:28:22.239]  It's not an easy read, but it's a short read, and it gets the point across.
[00:28:22.379 --> 00:28:22.919]  Absolutely.
[00:28:22.979 --> 00:28:24.059]  Thank you for the call.
[00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:25.800]  I really do appreciate it, Bob.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.041]  Yeah, I interviewed Anthony Sutton about four years ago.
[00:28:31.181 --> 00:28:31.601]  One time.
[00:28:31.642 --> 00:28:32.962]  I should have interviewed him dozens of times.
[00:28:32.982 --> 00:28:34.222]  He was like 90 years old.
[00:28:34.942 --> 00:28:36.563]  And two weeks before he died...
[00:28:37.652 --> 00:28:38.433]  I emailed him.
[00:28:38.553 --> 00:28:39.293]  I called his staff.
[00:28:39.313 --> 00:28:40.113]  They said, we're sorry.
[00:28:40.153 --> 00:28:41.754]  He's just too old.
[00:28:42.475 --> 00:28:50.339]  He sent me this really nice email, very cogent, thanking me for my work and saying that he just couldn't do it.
[00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:53.580]  Little did I know, this guy was about to die.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.162]  And he was sending me emails.
[00:28:56.902 --> 00:28:58.403]  What an amazing American.
[00:28:58.503 --> 00:28:59.964]  And, yeah, his books are incredible.
[00:28:59.984 --> 00:29:00.644]  People should get them.
[00:29:01.064 --> 00:29:01.965]  Wyatt in Maryland.
[00:29:02.005 --> 00:29:02.665]  Go ahead, Wyatt.
[00:29:02.685 --> 00:29:03.345]  You're on the air.
[00:29:03.685 --> 00:29:04.826]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:29:05.086 --> 00:29:05.606]  How you doing?
[00:29:05.687 --> 00:29:05.947]  Good.
[00:29:07.435 --> 00:29:17.203]  I'm listening to you on AM radio here, 1050 AM out of Silver Spring, Maryland, which is about five miles as the crow flies from downtown D.C.
[00:29:17.823 --> 00:29:19.845]  So if you need to reach D.C., you're reaching them.
[00:29:21.026 --> 00:29:23.168]  Well, I doubt the establishment's listening.
[00:29:23.188 --> 00:29:25.970]  They're too busy with their mistresses and Swiss bank accounts.
[00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.791]  But how are you doing today?
[00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:27.591]  Good, good.
[00:29:29.013 --> 00:29:33.096]  What I want to talk about is you mentioned Spice Girls, but it's actually the Dixie Chicks.
[00:29:34.238 --> 00:29:34.718]  Yeah, I know.
[00:29:34.958 --> 00:29:35.838]  Look, I'm brain dead.
[00:29:36.159 --> 00:29:36.419]  That's okay.
[00:29:36.439 --> 00:29:38.699]  I told you last week I've slept like 12 hours.
[00:29:38.719 --> 00:29:39.479]  That's okay.
[00:29:39.499 --> 00:29:39.960]  Yeah, look.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.121]  I know it's the Dixie Chicks, and they said kill them and all this.
[00:29:44.161 --> 00:29:45.141]  Yes, sir, you're right.
[00:29:47.422 --> 00:29:47.742]  Stay there.
[00:29:47.762 --> 00:29:48.662]  I'll let you finish when we get back.
[00:29:49.042 --> 00:29:50.943]  Yes, yes, that's the kind of mistakes I make.
[00:29:51.043 --> 00:29:55.984]  I'll say the wrong month of the year or something, but yes, yes, Dixie Chicks.
[00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:58.565]  The news is saying kill them, and I think that's wrong.
[00:30:00.485 --> 00:30:01.405]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.865 --> 00:30:03.386]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.372 --> 00:30:07.154]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.337 --> 00:30:12.118]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:12.298 --> 00:30:17.943]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:18.263 --> 00:30:19.144]  Probably never, right?
[00:30:19.384 --> 00:30:21.186]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to... ...4438.
[00:30:21.226 --> 00:30:22.827]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:30:42.541 --> 00:30:46.343]  Yes, I know that the Spice Girls are that British girl band.
[00:30:46.363 --> 00:30:49.205]  And I know that the Dixie Chicks live right here in Austin.
[00:30:49.225 --> 00:30:50.986]  I've even been in the studio that they record in.
[00:30:52.026 --> 00:30:53.888]  And I know some of their producers and people.
[00:30:54.508 --> 00:30:56.809]  And I know that the Dixie Chicks are not the Spice Girls.
[00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.071]  For some reason, my brain's weird like that.
[00:30:59.111 --> 00:30:59.411]  It'll get...
[00:31:00.249 --> 00:31:04.330]  Names of pop culture mixed up because, frankly, I'm not into any of it.
[00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:13.293]  But, yes, I know my wife ran out and bought a bunch of their music, though, and likes it since there's been the big fascist boycott of them.
[00:31:13.993 --> 00:31:27.957]  But the point I was making is I was finally sent that Dateline NBC special where they talked about the Spice Girls, and they had this old woman on there that said, I think they ought to strap the lead singer onto a bomb and drop her on Baghdad.
[00:31:28.581 --> 00:31:31.802]  You know, we've got old women screaming to kill American young women.
[00:31:32.483 --> 00:31:36.544]  It's insane, and other people making violent comments, and it's ha-ha, so funny.
[00:31:37.605 --> 00:31:42.867]  Terroristic threats on national TV because somebody said, we're embarrassed of this war and this president.
[00:31:43.127 --> 00:31:44.808]  Well, George Bush isn't running anything.
[00:31:44.828 --> 00:31:45.428]  He's a puppet.
[00:31:45.748 --> 00:31:48.309]  His daddy, the CIA director, was a Skull and Bones puppet.
[00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:49.550]  Bill Clinton's a puppet.
[00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:53.231]  They're all puppets of the military-industrial complex.
[00:31:54.271 --> 00:31:55.312]  And I want to make that clear.
[00:31:56.144 --> 00:32:01.567]  But I'm just showing how crazy it is when a DJ plays the Spice Girls and gets suspended.
[00:32:01.587 --> 00:32:03.788]  I mean, is that what a free country's about?
[00:32:03.808 --> 00:32:06.750]  You talk about McCarthyism.
[00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:08.431]  The problem is McCarthy was right.
[00:32:09.211 --> 00:32:10.372]  The files have now shown.
[00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:16.662]  This new thing is when somebody just criticizes the government, the government and the media boycott them.
[00:32:16.682 --> 00:32:17.762]  Well, it's not working.
[00:32:18.123 --> 00:32:19.603]  There's a huge backlash to it.
[00:32:19.883 --> 00:32:29.805]  And there's a reason they're having to do this now and try to pass hate crimes and thought crimes laws and try to shut down any type of protest for the right wing or the left wing, whoever's out there protesting.
[00:32:29.825 --> 00:32:31.806]  It's been happening to pro-lifers for a long time.
[00:32:31.846 --> 00:32:32.946]  Now it's happening to the leftists.
[00:32:34.206 --> 00:32:38.287]  And it's wrong regardless of who it happens to because we're having an effect.
[00:32:39.546 --> 00:32:40.927]  They want to put toxins in our vaccines.
[00:32:40.947 --> 00:32:42.427]  They want to break down the schools.
[00:33:07.299 --> 00:33:08.859]  And turn them into re-education centers.
[00:33:08.899 --> 00:33:11.600]  They want to confiscate our guns, and they're doing it.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.361]  They want to open our borders.
[00:33:13.801 --> 00:33:15.481]  They want to get rid of our sovereignty.
[00:33:15.841 --> 00:33:17.122]  They want to enslave us.
[00:33:17.442 --> 00:33:19.222]  And that makes me angry.
[00:33:19.583 --> 00:33:20.943]  Leave us alone!
[00:33:21.463 --> 00:33:23.764]  Well, they're not going to do that, so we'll have to stand up against them.
[00:33:24.144 --> 00:33:27.005]  Wyatt Maryland listening on the AM there in D.C.
[00:33:27.345 --> 00:33:28.265]  What's going on, Wyatt?
[00:33:28.425 --> 00:33:35.227]  Okay, what I wanted to talk about was you mentioned the Dixie Chicks, and the reason I'm talking about that today is that
[00:33:37.199 --> 00:33:45.086]  Clearview, the multimedia conglomerate that owns over 1,400 radio stations.
[00:33:45.146 --> 00:33:46.107]  Now you're getting names wrong.
[00:33:46.147 --> 00:33:46.987]  Now it's Clear Channel.
[00:33:47.308 --> 00:33:48.188]  Clear Channel, I'm sorry.
[00:33:48.809 --> 00:33:49.289]  Clear Channel.
[00:33:49.309 --> 00:33:52.552]  I'm looking at a TV that says Clearview on it.
[00:33:52.812 --> 00:33:53.392]  Clear Channel.
[00:33:55.834 --> 00:34:04.942]  They're the ones that have been behind this anti-Dixie Chicks playing, and they've also been behind All-Pro Bush...
[00:34:07.433 --> 00:34:15.698]  Sir, they admit in a memo that's been in the newspaper that they ordered everyone to worship Bush, to worship all policies.
[00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.420]  Anyone criticizing will be immediately terminated.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.082]  That is what's going on, and that should outrage all Americans.
[00:34:22.502 --> 00:34:24.184]  Okay, what I want to add to this is this.
[00:34:25.324 --> 00:34:34.670]  FX Radio, which is satellite radio that's also in D.C., one of their headquarters is in D.C., they're a subsidiary of Clear Channel.
[00:34:35.297 --> 00:34:41.622]  And they are promoting the Dixie Chicks on their tours around the country.
[00:34:41.642 --> 00:34:44.644]  I think they have 26 cities that they're going to be in.
[00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:54.592]  So it's Clear Channel who is sponsoring the Dixie Chicks on their tours, but it's also Clear Channel who is eliminating them from giving them bad PR.
[00:34:54.632 --> 00:34:57.995]  Well, you understand this is being done at a more... You just pierced the veil.
[00:34:58.095 --> 00:35:02.178]  I wasn't going to say it, but it looks like a promotion drive.
[00:35:02.418 --> 00:35:03.719]  Yes, that's exactly what it is.
[00:35:03.759 --> 00:35:04.840]  Now, maybe she did say it,
[00:35:05.484 --> 00:35:06.585]  And who cares what she says?
[00:35:06.605 --> 00:35:09.467]  She has, as far as I'm concerned, a right to say anything.
[00:35:09.667 --> 00:35:15.310]  Yeah, how many veterans sat in mud puddles with their guts hanging out so she could talk like that?
[00:35:15.671 --> 00:35:19.273]  That is her right, and how dare the neocons try to shut that down?
[00:35:19.493 --> 00:35:22.695]  So it has a multifaceted system.
[00:35:23.035 --> 00:35:27.078]  It makes everybody be afraid to speak out, or, oh, they'll be like the Dixie Chicks, which isn't true.
[00:35:27.118 --> 00:35:28.139]  They can't attack everybody.
[00:35:28.779 --> 00:35:30.720]  And it makes some more money on the hind end.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.100]  Go ahead.
[00:35:31.701 --> 00:35:33.682]  And it's just like when you confronted Bush...
[00:35:35.293 --> 00:35:38.614]  Yeah, here I am, number one talk show in Austin.
[00:35:38.634 --> 00:35:41.415]  My sister was even in school at the very time with his daughters.
[00:35:41.455 --> 00:35:41.935]  Bush knows me.
[00:35:41.975 --> 00:35:42.716]  It was in the newspaper.
[00:35:42.756 --> 00:35:44.576]  He turned and said, that's Alex Jones.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:00.604]  At the end of his speech, because his speech had been on the governor's website, I knew when it ended, they had said they'd take questions from the media.
[00:36:00.644 --> 00:36:02.385]  Right before he went on, they said no questions.
[00:36:02.805 --> 00:36:04.606]  I said, I mean, the press always does that.
[00:36:04.986 --> 00:36:07.828]  I said, Governor, sir, I'm very polite.
[00:36:07.888 --> 00:36:09.249]  I say, this is in 98.
[00:36:09.489 --> 00:36:10.850]  I say, what about the CFR?
[00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.071]  What about the Federal Reserve?
[00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:13.892]  Is that what's destroying America, Governor?
[00:36:14.192 --> 00:36:15.273]  Don't you care about America?
[00:36:15.293 --> 00:36:16.494]  Why don't you talk about that, Governor?
[00:36:17.194 --> 00:36:23.540]  And they had me hauled out, almost broke my arm, and then kidnapped me for 45 minutes and threw me out on the side of the highway.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.561]  And they came over the CB.
[00:36:26.022 --> 00:36:28.063]  They said, the governor says release him.
[00:36:28.083 --> 00:36:29.464]  So I guess I ought to thank Bush for that.
[00:36:29.504 --> 00:36:31.306]  I was going to get charged with a bunch of stuff.
[00:36:31.346 --> 00:36:34.208]  It's on video of them discussing how to charge me.
[00:36:35.009 --> 00:36:38.112]  And literally, the chief of staff of the governor comes over and is there.
[00:36:38.132 --> 00:36:44.076]  I was told the squad car outside, as I'm 45 minutes away on the highway, says release him.
[00:36:44.096 --> 00:36:45.177]  They were taking me somewhere.
[00:36:45.237 --> 00:36:45.758]  I don't know where.
[00:36:46.977 --> 00:36:54.039]  They even took your cameraman that was following you and made him put his camera and put it away.
[00:36:54.059 --> 00:36:54.899]  Of course, he didn't.
[00:36:55.499 --> 00:37:02.661]  And so you see that it's only freedom of speech and freedom of the press for certain people.
[00:37:02.681 --> 00:37:06.602]  Well, for those that don't know, you've obviously seen one of my videos.
[00:37:08.348 --> 00:37:11.731]  We actually put that clip back in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:13.712]  It's one of the few things that's in the other films that's in this one.
[00:37:14.173 --> 00:37:14.853]  Thank you for the comment.
[00:37:14.873 --> 00:37:15.814]  All right, Alex, take care, buddy.
[00:37:15.974 --> 00:37:16.275]  You bet.
[00:37:16.455 --> 00:37:16.715]  You bet.
[00:37:16.755 --> 00:37:17.355]  Good to hear from you.
[00:37:17.375 --> 00:37:18.436]  You bet I'm ranting and raving.
[00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:19.818]  I'm upset about what's happening.
[00:37:19.858 --> 00:37:24.501]  Look, you know, I've gone out and put yard signs in hundreds of yards for the Republicans.
[00:37:24.641 --> 00:37:27.604]  I've sent them money, you know, back when I was in college, back in 1991, 92, 93.
[00:37:27.684 --> 00:37:29.065]  I'm not going to be part of that, folks.
[00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.592]  I'm not going to be part of this.
[00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:38.714]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:37:38.854 --> 00:37:40.135]  I believe in sovereignty.
[00:37:40.556 --> 00:37:41.536]  I believe in liberty.
[00:37:42.057 --> 00:37:44.439]  Don't put an R before it and then ram it through.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.982]  Bill Clinton could have never gotten away with this.
[00:37:47.182 --> 00:37:49.564]  Al Gore could have never gotten away with this.
[00:37:49.604 --> 00:37:54.929]  But because there's a Republican in the White House who's as phony as a $3 bill, we're buying it.
[00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:56.651]  Bush isn't from Texas.
[00:37:56.691 --> 00:37:57.872]  He's from County Buckport, Maine.
[00:37:59.713 --> 00:38:03.196]  Even Fox admits that out at the ranch they got hay bales and a tractor.
[00:38:03.616 --> 00:38:04.837]  It's a stage.
[00:38:05.918 --> 00:38:06.839]  Bush is up in St.
[00:38:06.899 --> 00:38:07.199]  Louis.
[00:38:07.239 --> 00:38:15.206]  They got fake boxes that say Made in the USA on them with the Made in China covered up, which the Washington Post reported is a felony.
[00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:19.610]  To have it in the warehouse with where it's made covered up, that's a felony.
[00:38:21.791 --> 00:38:22.672]  It's phony.
[00:38:22.812 --> 00:38:23.953]  It's a facade.
[00:38:24.153 --> 00:38:25.415]  Ron in New York.
[00:38:25.515 --> 00:38:26.375]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:38:26.455 --> 00:38:26.736]  Go ahead.
[00:38:26.756 --> 00:38:27.036]  Hi, Alex.
[00:38:27.492 --> 00:38:27.952]  How you doing?
[00:38:28.393 --> 00:38:35.918]  In reference to the assault weapons ban, which the president had announced he would re-endorse about three weeks ago, I believe he said that.
[00:38:36.158 --> 00:38:37.139]  Yeah, they said it again today.
[00:38:37.739 --> 00:38:39.020]  I called the NRA.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.963]  I called the Institute for Legislative Action at the NRA, and I've been calling them.
[00:38:43.103 --> 00:38:44.664]  By the way, we got the head of that fired.
[00:38:45.345 --> 00:38:45.665]  I'm sorry?
[00:38:45.765 --> 00:38:47.906]  They got the head of that run out last year.
[00:38:47.946 --> 00:38:53.827]  Remember when they tried to pass the $47 million NACERA land ground?
[00:38:53.847 --> 00:38:54.467]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:38:54.547 --> 00:38:55.407]  I do recall that.
[00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:56.827]  It was controversial.
[00:38:56.927 --> 00:38:57.648]  It's the CARA.
[00:38:57.688 --> 00:38:58.048]  CARA.
[00:38:58.068 --> 00:38:59.248]  CARA is real.
[00:38:59.288 --> 00:39:00.048]  NACERA is not, folks.
[00:39:00.708 --> 00:39:01.228]  CARA.
[00:39:01.808 --> 00:39:08.750]  And that guy tried to attack the Pentagon Foundation, the real conservative group, and Mr. Legislative Affairs had to go bye-bye.
[00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:09.110]  Go ahead.
[00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:13.691]  But in reference to the assault weapons ban, I asked them, and I stated...
[00:39:14.341 --> 00:39:24.289]  Has anybody from the NRA, considering that we gave Mr. Bush such crucial and wide support, has anybody gone up there to ask for an explanation of his reversal of position?
[00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:37.539]  I said, after all, if this were another president appealing to another political audience, whether it was a president in the past who had relied heavily on another group like the NAACP or the National Organization of Women, had that president reversed a position...
[00:39:38.328 --> 00:39:40.449]  Well, let's be clear.
[00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:50.235]  The NRA is the second most powerful organization in the country, the most active after the NARP, National Association of Retired Folks.
[00:39:51.116 --> 00:39:57.080]  The new NRA, though, is actually anti-gun in their actions, and I've exposed this Trojan horse activity.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:57.440]  Go ahead.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.283]  Well, ironically, three weeks have passed, and I've called at least once a week,
[00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:04.107]  And they say, no, there's nothing.
[00:40:04.147 --> 00:40:05.427]  We have nothing to say about it.
[00:40:05.447 --> 00:40:06.348]  There's no statement.
[00:40:06.728 --> 00:40:12.229]  Nobody from our organization has gone up there and asked the president to account for this reversal of position.
[00:40:12.929 --> 00:40:13.989]  I said, this is outrageous.
[00:40:14.009 --> 00:40:20.590]  It was crucial and large support given to him during the 2000 election, predicated on opposition to this.
[00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:21.950]  Ron, how long have you been listening to this show?
[00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:26.651]  Oh, I would say I've been listening to you somewhere in the neighborhood of several months now.
[00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:27.651]  Okay.
[00:40:27.831 --> 00:40:30.992]  Did I not say almost every day that Bush is going to go and grab you?
[00:40:31.943 --> 00:40:34.445]  As long as I've been listening, yes, I've heard you say that.
[00:40:34.485 --> 00:40:36.266]  So before they said this, well, let me tell you.
[00:40:36.606 --> 00:40:42.549]  They got a bill that makes Clinton's assault weapons bill look conservative, okay?
[00:40:42.569 --> 00:40:49.394]  S-22 is loaded with every type of gun control, worse than anything Clinton ever dreamed of.
[00:40:49.834 --> 00:40:51.455]  I mean, gun registration...
[00:40:52.422 --> 00:40:53.463]  Ballistics test.
[00:40:53.543 --> 00:40:54.784]  Your Lady of Peace Act.
[00:40:55.184 --> 00:40:56.064]  It's the end of America, sir.
[00:40:56.084 --> 00:40:59.747]  Which I know he was supportive of when that was first introduced about a year back.
[00:41:00.087 --> 00:41:01.448]  Yeah, both were supportive of that.
[00:41:01.508 --> 00:41:03.369]  So this is what I'm talking about.
[00:41:04.249 --> 00:41:05.090]  So this is strange.
[00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:09.493]  So even organizations that you rely upon to defend your rights may be suspect.
[00:41:10.213 --> 00:41:12.354]  You know, another issue, too, something that... Hold on.
[00:41:12.534 --> 00:41:16.577]  They can't disarm 130 million gun owners unless they've got a Trojan horse, sir.
[00:41:17.848 --> 00:41:23.250]  They got to see 5 million of the most active gun owners are members of the NRA, and they think, oh, they'll handle it.
[00:41:23.611 --> 00:41:27.712]  I just buy the magazine every year and, you know, pay my 30 bucks, and I'm safe.
[00:41:27.892 --> 00:41:28.473]  No, you're not.
[00:41:28.493 --> 00:41:29.033]  Let me tell you something.
[00:41:29.573 --> 00:41:33.495]  They had a bill to ban anybody under 18 from touching a handgun, even with their parents.
[00:41:33.875 --> 00:41:35.976]  It would ban Junior Olympics and some Olympic shooters.
[00:41:36.696 --> 00:41:40.218]  Ban under 21 a handgun, 18 a rifle.
[00:41:40.758 --> 00:41:42.339]  They had all these bills shut down.
[00:41:42.379 --> 00:41:43.279]  Gun shows, everything.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.300]  That was going to pass.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.261]  The NRA was just not even really opposing it.
[00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:50.090]  We had a rally, had all these folks show up.
[00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:52.291]  The NRA wouldn't speak at our rally.
[00:41:52.991 --> 00:41:56.191]  Understand, we've had Ron Paul, Senator Bob Smith, and others at our rallies.
[00:41:56.732 --> 00:41:58.552]  They wouldn't come, sir.
[00:41:58.612 --> 00:42:04.373]  And then they attacked Peaceable Texas for Firearms Rights in the Dallas Morning News and called us extreme.
[00:42:04.413 --> 00:42:04.793]  Go ahead.
[00:42:04.973 --> 00:42:07.773]  You're speaking about minimum ages for possession.
[00:42:08.994 --> 00:42:16.595]  Here in the city of New York, in the city of New York, no one under the age of 21 can even own a rifle anymore.
[00:42:18.092 --> 00:42:20.673]  Which is, I'm sure your audience knows, it's common.
[00:42:21.034 --> 00:42:24.576]  18 was usually set as the milestone for possession of a long gun.
[00:42:24.656 --> 00:42:28.778]  And you've got to have 14 different licenses and have a sheriff, a little extra cash.
[00:42:28.798 --> 00:42:29.799]  A pile of bureaucracy.
[00:42:30.219 --> 00:42:34.021]  But you have to be at least 21 years of age now to own a long gun in the city of New York.
[00:42:34.381 --> 00:42:41.363]  And California's banned most guns, going after the ammo, banning it in L.A., and their crime rate, their murder rate jumped 11%.
[00:42:42.483 --> 00:42:45.743]  When I said 11% last week, the caller called and said, well, my news says 35%.
[00:42:46.324 --> 00:42:46.944]  He was right.
[00:42:46.984 --> 00:42:48.384]  Now I have an article AP on it.
[00:42:49.404 --> 00:42:51.245]  Murder by 11, overall crime, 35%.
[00:42:53.085 --> 00:42:57.986]  States that have loosened gun laws, crime rates have imploded.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.402]  Well, that's what happens in California.
[00:43:01.482 --> 00:43:05.486]  Probably all the wrong people own the guns, and all the good people are being denied the rights.
[00:43:05.606 --> 00:43:11.212]  There's gun members running around, foaming at the mouth, shooting police, and the SWAT teams are too busy raiding gun dealers' houses.
[00:43:11.232 --> 00:43:11.692]  Thanks for the call.
[00:43:11.712 --> 00:43:12.873]  You know, one last thing, Alex.
[00:43:13.053 --> 00:43:13.274]  Yeah.
[00:43:13.374 --> 00:43:14.294]  Alex, I want to move along.
[00:43:14.315 --> 00:43:15.496]  Another thing that's troubled me.
[00:43:15.596 --> 00:43:22.963]  Lately, I've seen a phenomenon since the beginning of this new year, and I've seen it on C-SPAN, and I've seen it on some public access TV in my area.
[00:43:23.658 --> 00:43:28.499]  Military officials, colonels, captains, majors, and so forth... Oversaying police operations.
[00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:29.660]  No, no, wait a second.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.120]  This is what they've been doing lately that's been bothering me.
[00:43:32.501 --> 00:43:37.042]  They describe themselves as Colonel So-and-So, United States Army, and member of CFR.
[00:43:37.542 --> 00:43:43.524]  I saw something on C-SPAN where they had a gathering of military brass at a CFR conference.
[00:43:44.104 --> 00:43:51.566]  Now, how could you be a representative of the interests of the United States and be a representative of the CFR...
[00:43:52.324 --> 00:43:55.206]  Those are contradictory principles.
[00:43:55.226 --> 00:43:58.909]  Well, let me... I appreciate the call, and send me a tape of that if you get it, but let me just say this.
[00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:11.019]  I have watched hundreds of news programs, and on about half of them now, multiple members, not one, but multiple members of the panel, will be counsel on foreign relations.
[00:44:11.079 --> 00:44:16.523]  Now, they were set up in 1922 in New York, publicly to destroy American sovereignty and bring us into an empire.
[00:44:17.084 --> 00:44:20.467]  Publicly, they're bimonthly magazine foreign affairs,
[00:44:21.167 --> 00:44:27.691]  Says, New World Order, World Government, take your liberties, set up a World Government, New World Order, New World Order, New World Order.
[00:44:28.151 --> 00:44:32.453]  So all these years, I remember being on the radio eight years ago and saying, the CFR wants to take your rights.
[00:44:32.854 --> 00:44:40.718]  Somebody'd call in and say, well, I heard that that's a code word for, you know, that it doesn't exist, that you're crazy.
[00:44:42.099 --> 00:44:43.580]  I'd go, it's a public organization.
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.422]  And yes, now I know that a lot of brass for CFR, I've seen that myself.
[00:44:48.306 --> 00:44:49.807]  And you're right.
[00:44:49.907 --> 00:44:53.950]  Private group sworn to destroy America, sworn for world government.
[00:44:54.671 --> 00:44:59.814]  And in the new film, I have a clip of the head of NATO a few years back, a U.S.
[00:44:59.834 --> 00:45:06.519]  general, saying, you are the forces of a new world order at a gun confiscation drill with Czechoslovakian American troops.
[00:45:06.619 --> 00:45:08.120]  So, yes, you're right, Ron.
[00:45:08.481 --> 00:45:09.201]  Ken in Texas.
[00:45:09.221 --> 00:45:09.922]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:45:09.962 --> 00:45:10.402]  Go ahead.
[00:45:13.744 --> 00:45:15.065]  We got Ken there, or is he gone?
[00:45:15.125 --> 00:45:15.286]  Hello.
[00:45:15.486 --> 00:45:15.806]  Hello, Alex.
[00:45:15.826 --> 00:45:16.406]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:45:16.506 --> 00:45:17.107]  I'm sorry about that.
[00:45:17.568 --> 00:45:22.590]  I just want to let you know that basically I went last night and saw this new movie called Anger Management with Jack Nicholson.
[00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:31.773]  And I just want to let you know that basically I know you said in the past that the CIA and other government entities apparently pay Hollywood script writers a great deal of money to kind of write the scripts for the movies in some respects.
[00:45:32.053 --> 00:45:33.574]  Yeah, they admit he's innocent.
[00:45:33.614 --> 00:45:36.975]  They frame him, give him false charges, but it's good.
[00:45:36.995 --> 00:45:38.575]  The government did it because they love him.
[00:45:38.835 --> 00:45:39.996]  Oh, you're talking about the movie itself?
[00:45:40.036 --> 00:45:40.736]  Yes, exactly.
[00:45:41.116 --> 00:45:46.458]  It kind of basically started with the fact that Sandler basically wanted to get a headset to watch a movie
[00:45:46.937 --> 00:45:47.317]  I think so.
[00:46:02.717 --> 00:46:14.948]  And basically then she had an air marshal come up and basically say the same thing to him, and from that point forward he was charged with... Then they electrocute him and... Well, he was charged with actually assaulting a flight attendant, so in court, of course, it went from there.
[00:46:15.188 --> 00:46:21.654]  But what I'm saying is, it seems like to me what they're doing now is they're moving one step, as you've said before, they're moving ahead very assertively and aggressively now.
[00:46:21.694 --> 00:46:24.416]  By the way, it's not just billboards in that movie.
[00:46:24.957 --> 00:46:27.519]  I've learned how to notice...
[00:46:28.237 --> 00:46:30.558]  Subliminals, I did see frames in that movie.
[00:46:30.718 --> 00:46:31.939]  I've sat in the theater watching it.
[00:46:32.379 --> 00:46:35.421]  Army of One is flashing, I think, about every couple minutes in that.
[00:46:36.261 --> 00:46:36.622]  Okay.
[00:46:36.762 --> 00:46:38.142]  Oh, it's all part of the freedom.
[00:46:38.663 --> 00:46:41.384]  Well, I didn't know if you'd seen the movie or not, but I just want to kind of point that out.
[00:46:41.504 --> 00:46:41.944]  Oh, yeah.
[00:46:41.964 --> 00:46:43.885]  Well, did you see all the Army of One billboards in it?
[00:46:44.306 --> 00:46:44.846]  I sure did.
[00:46:44.966 --> 00:46:45.706]  You're right, exactly.
[00:46:45.826 --> 00:46:55.972]  Also, I believe, I was watching it, I got the yellow and the star, the black star, you know, one frame, I'll have to get it on VHS and watch it more closely when it comes out, but I believe they were also flashing Army of One.
[00:46:56.576 --> 00:47:00.057]  It was there several times on the screen for people to take a look at, exactly.
[00:47:00.137 --> 00:47:02.198]  But I'm not just saying flash in the billboard, sir.
[00:47:02.858 --> 00:47:07.659]  I'm saying, you know the former top CIA mind control expert wrote The Exorcist?
[00:47:08.139 --> 00:47:14.261]  Well, they now admit that in that movie they have frames of demons, of blood, throughout it.
[00:47:14.301 --> 00:47:15.521]  There's admitted mind control.
[00:47:15.821 --> 00:47:18.702]  Well, that technique is now in most newscasts, everything.
[00:47:19.312 --> 00:47:20.853]  I hear what you're saying.
[00:47:20.913 --> 00:47:26.595]  I knew that you were also saying basically what they're doing is they're also... They're basically like the movies and television and other publications.
[00:47:26.615 --> 00:47:28.936]  They're like the cutting edge, leading edge, so to speak.
[00:47:28.956 --> 00:47:30.477]  They're kind of conditioning psychologically.
[00:47:30.517 --> 00:47:33.638]  It's not called product placement, though the government pays for it.
[00:47:33.678 --> 00:47:35.359]  It's called product placement of corporations.
[00:47:35.799 --> 00:47:40.981]  Taco Bell or McDonald's pay for their products in it, or Budweiser can of beer or Marlboro cigarettes.
[00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:45.042]  Now they're shifting to propaganda placement.
[00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:46.063]  The government is spending...
[00:47:46.643 --> 00:47:47.204]  What is it now?
[00:47:47.224 --> 00:47:48.325]  $80 million a year.
[00:47:48.405 --> 00:47:50.667]  The government then doubles that with matching funds.
[00:47:51.047 --> 00:47:54.631]  We're talking $160 million a year to pay for propaganda and movies.
[00:47:54.991 --> 00:47:58.735]  That's why every episode of 24 has torture being good on Fox.
[00:47:59.375 --> 00:48:06.376]  Well, they're basically just conditioning the masses and the public to accept these things, so when they finally do happen, they'll say, well, I've known about that for some time, so it's no big deal, etc.
[00:48:06.616 --> 00:48:06.876]  That's it.
[00:48:06.896 --> 00:48:07.656]  They're acclimating.
[00:48:07.676 --> 00:48:09.817]  That's what all the urban warfare training's been about, Ken.
[00:48:10.517 --> 00:48:12.237]  To acclimate us, to prepare us for this.
[00:48:12.497 --> 00:48:13.197]  I hear what you're saying.
[00:48:13.217 --> 00:48:13.978]  I just wanted to point that out.
[00:48:13.998 --> 00:48:15.278]  I didn't know if you knew about it.
[00:48:15.318 --> 00:48:15.818]  Well, thank you.
[00:48:15.858 --> 00:48:17.098]  No, I did get a lot of calls about it.
[00:48:17.118 --> 00:48:18.798]  I finally went and saw it a couple weeks ago.
[00:48:18.858 --> 00:48:24.819]  I never mentioned it, but yeah, it's... I walked out of that thing with my wife, and I said, you've just seen a CIA production, my dear.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:27.920]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:28.340]  Stay with us.
[00:48:31.289 --> 00:48:38.113]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:48:38.433 --> 00:48:39.814]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:48:39.994 --> 00:48:42.215]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:48:42.355 --> 00:48:44.436]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:48:44.736 --> 00:48:49.659]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:48:49.999 --> 00:48:54.042]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:48:54.302 --> 00:48:56.063]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:48:56.143 --> 00:49:00.265]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmarish
[00:49:00.265 --> 00:49:00.585]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:49:00.645 --> 00:49:01.126]  That's 888-2533-139.

[00:49:02.987 --> 00:49:03.627]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[00:49:31.784 --> 00:49:32.124]  We're good to go.
[00:49:54.704 --> 00:49:55.504]  We're good to go.
[00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:24.134]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:50:24.775 --> 00:50:28.237]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:50:31.739 --> 00:50:37.663]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:50:37.903 --> 00:50:40.145]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:51:31.837 --> 00:51:37.482]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:40.685 --> 00:51:43.407]  All right, more of your calls coming up here in a few minutes in a ton of the news.
[00:51:43.447 --> 00:51:46.130]  We haven't gotten to yet, and we've got a guest coming on.
[00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:56.879]  The new America is all about masses of tanks attacking with police and military and the rest of it.
[00:51:57.998 --> 00:52:02.001]  All over the country, and we'll be talking to the lawyer for the neighborhood that got raided.
[00:52:02.021 --> 00:52:06.605]  In Eugene, Oregon, no drugs were found, but hey, arrests, they went ahead and made arrests.
[00:52:06.665 --> 00:52:11.048]  They're going to go ahead and seize what they got, because, well, it's all part of freedom.
[00:52:11.108 --> 00:52:12.569]  No charges, they just take what you got.
[00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:15.131]  It's all part of living in a free country.
[00:52:15.672 --> 00:52:21.416]  As the government chips in the majority of the narcotics, which is an open secret, public information,
[00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:28.568]  And, in fact, you'll have police units dealing the drugs and then later raiding it down the line, down the chain.
[00:52:29.188 --> 00:52:32.231]  I mean, that's the wonders of living in a third world dictatorship.
[00:52:33.392 --> 00:52:35.834]  And, again, neocons dance to a Strauss waltz.
[00:52:35.874 --> 00:52:46.242]  It's now coming out even in the New York Times, paddling on themselves, I guess, that the neocon Grand Poobah was an anti-liberty type guy from Deutschland.
[00:52:47.888 --> 00:52:50.389]  Again, David Bloom, death tied to smallpox shot.
[00:52:50.449 --> 00:52:53.731]  NBC correspondent, possibly victim of toxic vaccine before war in Iraq.
[00:52:54.851 --> 00:53:08.638]  And it goes on to say that the exact problem, embolism, heart attack he had is what the vaccine's been causing to the weeks, several weeks before he died.
[00:53:08.678 --> 00:53:11.019]  He got the anthrax and the smallpox shots.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:12.360]  And...
[00:53:14.255 --> 00:53:18.618]  There's an article here, New Fears Over Toxic Vaccines, the London Evening Standard.
[00:53:19.338 --> 00:53:21.379]  New Fears Over Toxic Vaccines.
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:29.784]  Concern is growing today over the health risk posed by vaccines used to protect soldiers and civilians from biological attack.
[00:53:30.125 --> 00:53:31.826]  Follows a decision by U.S.
[00:53:31.866 --> 00:53:36.609]  government to limit the use of smallpox vaccination programs following a number of deaths.
[00:53:36.749 --> 00:53:40.491]  The original plan was to vaccinate 500,000 healthcare workers and at least...
[00:53:41.252 --> 00:53:43.753]  The first defense against possible biological terrorism.
[00:53:43.793 --> 00:53:46.355]  Today, only 35,000 have been given the vaccine.
[00:53:46.395 --> 00:53:49.276]  That is totally untrue, according to the LA Times and AP.
[00:53:49.617 --> 00:53:50.777]  You're talking in the hundreds.
[00:53:51.418 --> 00:53:52.758]  And the troops, I guess it's 35,000.
[00:53:52.798 --> 00:53:55.460]  Maybe that's where they're getting that number.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.421]  I know we're going to vaccinate all the troops.
[00:53:57.441 --> 00:54:09.948]  We're going to vaccinate 11 million in the first phase, and Bush is going to set up a giant $10 billion a year vaccine program to inject you with a whole list of vaccines, setting up a bureaucracy for forced injection.
[00:54:11.252 --> 00:54:15.954]  Coming up, California reaffirms its controversial gun decision.
[00:54:15.974 --> 00:54:16.915]  The federal court did.
[00:54:16.935 --> 00:54:18.356]  This is United Press International.
[00:54:19.736 --> 00:54:22.338]  We're going to get into banning the Minuteman statue.
[00:54:22.358 --> 00:54:23.098]  Got to get rid of him.
[00:54:23.138 --> 00:54:24.299]  He's a white man with a gun.
[00:54:24.339 --> 00:54:24.979]  It's bad.
[00:54:24.999 --> 00:54:26.600]  That's from the Republican newspaper.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.921]  Minuteman faces PC onslaught.
[00:54:30.775 --> 00:54:32.177]  It just goes on and on.
[00:54:32.457 --> 00:54:36.741]  And why are the Iraqis rioting and protesting?
[00:54:37.281 --> 00:54:42.967]  They're mad that the Ba'ath torturers and controllers of Saddam are being put into power again.
[00:54:43.007 --> 00:54:51.995]  Well, of course, most of them were trained in the 70s and 80s, some in the 60s and 50s like Saddam and Aziz and others, by the CIA.
[00:54:52.896 --> 00:54:54.618]  That's coming up as well.
[00:54:55.999 --> 00:54:56.661]  $20 a month, excuse me.
[00:55:05.991 --> 00:55:08.393]  $20 a month to work for the big global corporations.
[00:55:08.433 --> 00:55:11.794]  So a nation of 19 million total slaves.
[00:55:12.275 --> 00:55:19.499]  So you get 19 million slaves, the oil, the weapons sales, the domestic police state crackdown, the precedent to attack sovereign nations.
[00:55:19.559 --> 00:55:20.339]  And it is official.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.761]  They plan to attack North Korea sometime this year.
[00:55:22.781 --> 00:55:26.023]  We don't know if they'll launch them, but that's what Rumsfeld's plan says.
[00:55:27.992 --> 00:55:31.033]  Before I go any further, and in this hour, you've got to get my videos.
[00:55:31.213 --> 00:55:31.953]  I've made eight of them.
[00:55:31.973 --> 00:55:34.853]  Now I've made the ninth, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:55:35.193 --> 00:55:37.614]  It's two hours and 37 minutes long.
[00:55:38.034 --> 00:55:39.534]  A true tour de force.
[00:55:40.214 --> 00:55:41.235]  An amazing film.
[00:55:41.515 --> 00:55:42.415]  You must get it.
[00:55:42.595 --> 00:55:44.195]  And your purchase supports the broadcast.
[00:55:44.635 --> 00:55:46.956]  And when you get the videos, I want you to make copies.
[00:55:47.316 --> 00:55:49.116]  You want to find out what the globalist plan is?
[00:55:49.196 --> 00:55:54.557]  Get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Monsters of Terror, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:55:54.697 --> 00:55:55.538]  Order today.
[00:55:55.558 --> 00:55:57.518]  You get a discount when you get three or more videos.

[00:55:58.378 --> 00:55:58.978]  Don't wait.
[00:55:59.318 --> 00:56:00.419]  Call now.
[00:56:00.439 --> 00:56:00.499]  1-888-253-3139.

[00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:02.859]  Again, 888-253-3139.
[00:56:02.879 --> 00:56:04.900]  Second and third hours coming up.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.600]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:56:21.483 --> 00:56:22.223]  Are you prepared?
[00:56:22.424 --> 00:56:24.805]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[00:56:25.025 --> 00:56:29.447]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[00:56:29.767 --> 00:56:32.528]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our aglity.
[00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:39.672]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.196 --> 00:56:47.857]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.517 --> 00:56:49.557]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.277 --> 00:56:51.497]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.058 --> 00:56:52.858]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.618 --> 00:56:54.518]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.538 --> 00:56:59.119]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.359 --> 00:57:03.500]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:14.823]  Imagine heavy armored vehicles, troops in black uniforms, helicopters, smashing into homes, raiding a neighborhood.
[00:57:15.845 --> 00:57:17.326]  Putting bags over your heads.
[00:57:17.386 --> 00:57:18.787]  That's the new thing the police are doing.
[00:57:19.227 --> 00:57:23.850]  They liked watching it on TV with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, those that weren't CIA, that weren't protected.
[00:57:24.391 --> 00:57:25.371]  So now they're doing that.
[00:57:25.632 --> 00:57:30.195]  And funny, in movies like 1984 and books like 1984, they did that.
[00:57:30.235 --> 00:57:34.537]  And that movie Brazil, when they come in and police tell you they put a bag over your head.
[00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:36.119]  See, they got all that.
[00:57:36.139 --> 00:57:39.621]  Those writers got that from experiences in the Soviet Union.
[00:57:40.902 --> 00:57:44.704]  And now Homeland Security is going to have the KGB chief helping run things.
[00:57:45.144 --> 00:57:45.985]  It's all part of the freedom.
[00:57:46.005 --> 00:57:48.026]  We've got a guest coming up to talk about this in the next segment.
[00:57:48.446 --> 00:57:50.567]  Right now, Lou in Colorado, Debbie in Oklahoma.
[00:57:50.947 --> 00:57:52.328]  Lou in Colorado, you're on the air.
[00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:52.808]  Go ahead.
[00:57:53.189 --> 00:57:54.369]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:54.409 --> 00:57:58.171]  Freedom, men in black uniforms, busting in, pulling black bags over your heads.
[00:57:58.811 --> 00:57:59.852]  It's just wonderful, isn't it?
[00:58:00.272 --> 00:58:01.793]  Oh, it makes you proud to be an American.
[00:58:01.813 --> 00:58:03.234]  That's unbelievable.
[00:58:04.755 --> 00:58:09.217]  I sent you a copy of that thing, too, that you wanted from Thomas Borg, that guy that was the communist guy in the
[00:58:09.773 --> 00:58:15.415]  I saw a photo over there that was going to talk about the Mexicans, these communist Mexicans coming across the border.
[00:58:15.575 --> 00:58:16.075]  I got that.
[00:58:16.095 --> 00:58:21.556]  The news articles where they admit that they were going to be colonized the Southwest and the whole plan right out of D.C., yeah.
[00:58:21.616 --> 00:58:21.936]  Right.
[00:58:22.856 --> 00:58:32.539]  One of the things that I was curious about, too, is I know you had a couple times you talked about that incident, which was really interesting to me, and that was in New York where the firemen had the radios working.
[00:58:33.675 --> 00:58:33.975]  Yes.
[00:58:34.376 --> 00:58:36.158]  Where was that information?
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:43.548]  New York Daily News and the Associated Press, the government said that all the radios malfunctioned.
[00:58:43.568 --> 00:58:45.331]  That is totally false.
[00:58:46.132 --> 00:58:47.674]  None of the radios malfunctioned.
[00:58:47.894 --> 00:58:49.737]  They reported the fires were almost out.
[00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:52.371]  That was in the news itself, that part of it?
[00:58:52.752 --> 00:58:53.692]  That has been released.
[00:58:54.713 --> 00:58:55.393]  That was released.
[00:58:55.413 --> 00:59:01.337]  And the government went into a complete hysteria, sort of threatening firefighters, telling them to shut up, and that's the facts.
[00:59:01.637 --> 00:59:02.618]  Yeah, that's unbelievable.
[00:59:04.359 --> 00:59:10.062]  And the manuals that the police have saying that you're a constitutionalist or a Christian...
[00:59:12.177 --> 00:59:13.719]  Can they be got on your website at all?
[00:59:14.179 --> 00:59:15.760]  Yeah, Megiddo is one of the first.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.862]  It's in law enforcement magazines.
[00:59:18.622 --> 00:59:22.445]  It's in flyers, training manuals, and on video in the Road to Tyranny.
[00:59:22.465 --> 00:59:22.946]  Oh, okay.
[00:59:23.466 --> 00:59:26.529]  And the Washington Times wrote about it.
[00:59:27.569 --> 00:59:31.813]  The Herald Register in West Virginia wrote an article.
[00:59:32.609 --> 00:59:35.651]  About how the university curriculum says that for law enforcement.
[00:59:35.671 --> 00:59:37.052]  So, yes, it's all out there.
[00:59:38.073 --> 00:59:42.756]  Well, I think one thing that I think people have to learn, and that's to pick up their Constitution.
[00:59:42.776 --> 00:59:46.478]  So, you know, it's so hard when you talk to somebody that has no basis whatsoever.
[00:59:46.498 --> 00:59:51.822]  They can be turned around so easy, just like saying that treaties of the supreme law of land can overturn the Constitution.
[00:59:51.862 --> 00:59:52.983]  I'm doing a whole piece on that.
[00:59:53.383 --> 01:00:06.915]  I think it's important for people to go back and read some of the Founding Fathers' stuff and stuff.
[01:00:06.935 --> 01:00:10.499]  I'm going to give you a quick one here, and this is on the basis of freedom.
[01:00:10.519 --> 01:00:11.700]  We've got about a minute.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:11.940]  Pardon?
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.741]  We've got about a minute.
[01:00:13.862 --> 01:00:14.722]  Yeah.
[01:00:14.923 --> 01:00:16.464]  Power would say that you shouldn't have freedom.
[01:00:17.029 --> 01:00:18.190]  This is written by Thomas Paine.
[01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:24.776]  He said, To say that people are not fit for freedom is to make poverty their choice, and to say that they had rather be loaded with taxes than not.
[01:00:25.476 --> 01:00:34.064]  If such a case be proved, it would equally prove that those who govern are not fit to govern them, for they are a part of the same national mass.
[01:00:34.224 --> 01:00:36.906]  And I think people ought to keep that in mind.
[01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:40.549]  That was by Thomas Paine on the 9th of February, 1793.
[01:00:43.087 --> 01:00:43.828]  Thanks for the call.
[01:00:43.948 --> 01:00:44.388]  Okay, bye.
[01:00:44.588 --> 01:00:45.068]  Thank you, Lou.
[01:00:45.088 --> 01:00:46.569]  Debbie in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:00:46.629 --> 01:00:47.050]  Go ahead.
[01:00:48.591 --> 01:00:56.236]  Yeah, about three days before that reporter died from the sitting too long, apparently.
[01:00:57.016 --> 01:00:57.837]  Or at least that's what they said.
[01:00:57.857 --> 01:00:59.758]  Now they're saying smallpox shot her, but go ahead.
[01:01:00.158 --> 01:01:11.566]  Well, the AP network news, you know, on Clear Channel, said that scientists knew research has found that sitting too long can cause blah, blah, blah, and described what happened to him.
[01:01:12.079 --> 01:01:12.899]  About three days later.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.981]  Yeah, that was really convenient timing, wasn't it?
[01:01:16.041 --> 01:01:16.341]  Hmm.
[01:01:17.842 --> 01:01:18.362]  Nice!
[01:01:18.782 --> 01:01:19.422]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:20.363]  Probably a coincidence.
[01:01:20.923 --> 01:01:21.703]  Anything else, Debbie?
[01:01:23.264 --> 01:01:23.984]  Thank you for the call.
[01:01:24.004 --> 01:01:25.045]  Sorry we're out of time for this segment.
[01:01:25.065 --> 01:01:25.685]  I'll have you on longer.
[01:01:26.085 --> 01:01:26.886]  Got a guest coming up.
[01:01:28.627 --> 01:01:31.368]  I mean, you talk about an Orwellian world.
[01:01:31.408 --> 01:01:32.688]  That's what we're facing here.
[01:01:33.149 --> 01:01:36.730]  We'll discuss it when we get back and get into more news and more calls.
[01:01:37.571 --> 01:01:39.191]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:01:43.627 --> 01:01:46.757]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.565]  The Sandian 505P shortwave radio
[01:01:52.261 --> 01:01:52.721]  We're good to go.
[01:02:14.346 --> 01:02:14.886]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:02:14.906 --> 01:02:15.246]  Call today.
[01:02:43.012 --> 01:02:50.395]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:50.655 --> 01:02:55.397]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.617 --> 01:03:01.259]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.499 --> 01:03:06.041]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:03:06.261 --> 01:03:13.404]  The casual society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:03:13.444 --> 01:03:17.967]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:20.648]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:03:20.868 --> 01:03:27.571]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:03:27.831 --> 01:03:28.132]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:42.034 --> 01:03:45.916]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:03:46.157 --> 01:03:51.600]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:04:02.226]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filter environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:04:02.406 --> 01:04:06.749]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:04:06.869 --> 01:04:07.729]  We're good to go.
[01:04:27.679 --> 01:04:28.500]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:51.098 --> 01:05:08.583]  We're already 8 minutes and 10 seconds into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast as we blast out on a growing list of wonderful AM&M affiliates, Global Shortwave, and the Internet at InfoWars.com and net.
[01:05:08.603 --> 01:05:17.325]  Let me just read part of this powerful article, and we're going to talk to the lawyer who wrote the story and got some of the other mainstream articles about it, Lauren Regan.
[01:05:18.323 --> 01:05:23.645]  Eugene police illegally raid homes with tank prompts federal lawsuit.
[01:05:25.226 --> 01:05:42.834]  And in the pre-dawn of October 17, 2002, approximately 50 police officers, I see this every day, from multiple police agencies that are federalized under multi-jurisdictional task force, swarmed residential neighborhood, we saw this in Austin, in Eugene, Oregon, USA, armed with automatic rifles,
[01:05:43.784 --> 01:05:47.806]  And accompanied by a National Guard military light armored vehicle, which looks like a tank.
[01:05:47.886 --> 01:05:48.606]  Now a lawsuit.
[01:05:48.626 --> 01:05:49.907]  This is a heavy LAV.
[01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:57.511]  Now a lawsuit has been filed against all the people and police agencies involved in the Gestapo action.
[01:05:59.071 --> 01:06:00.252]  And the victims of the...
[01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:15.066]  Egregiously false police raid and their attorneys announce an impending lawsuit against the Oregon State Police, Lane County Sheriff, Eugene and Springfield Police Departments, Portland Police Bureau, Oregon National Guard, and others.
[01:06:15.606 --> 01:06:18.329]  In the pre-dawn of October 17, 2002, approximately 50 police officers...
[01:06:20.211 --> 01:06:30.078]  ...from these agencies swarmed a residential neighborhood in Eugene, Oregon, USA, armed with automatic assault rifles and accompanied by a National Guard military light-armored vehicle, which looks like a tank.
[01:06:30.118 --> 01:06:34.341]  Police claim to be searching for marijuana, growing operation within three homes.
[01:06:34.761 --> 01:06:48.011]  Two couples, Marcilia Monroe, Tam Davidge, and Elizabeth Red... I'm trying to pronounce this... Rediki Jor Havens, were...
[01:06:49.113 --> 01:06:56.961]  Awakened by flashbang grenades being hurled into the backyards of their homes located in a densely populated residential neighborhood.
[01:06:58.602 --> 01:07:00.284]  And this is a 23-page article, by the way.
[01:07:00.304 --> 01:07:00.744]  It's incredible.
[01:07:00.764 --> 01:07:03.367]  You need to go to Infowars.com and read it and link through to it.
[01:07:04.315 --> 01:07:05.936]  And it goes on to say,
[01:07:27.421 --> 01:07:27.901]  We're good to go.
[01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:57.152]  And it goes on, the Registered Guard newspaper reported, eventually all charges were dismissed by the state.
[01:07:57.192 --> 01:08:04.117]  The raids caused physical and emotional injuries to the individuals and was extensive damage to their property.
[01:08:04.237 --> 01:08:12.584]  Now, I would also add to this that SWAT teams were set up by the CIA in 1965 in Los Angeles.
[01:08:13.305 --> 01:08:15.226]  Then it was the training model for all cities.
[01:08:15.607 --> 01:08:17.849]  Most big cities are now run by CIA.
[01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:18.729]  This is admitted.
[01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:20.591]  Old mainstream articles have been written.
[01:08:21.238 --> 01:08:21.978]  They get a cop.
[01:08:22.239 --> 01:08:23.539]  They bring him into the city council.
[01:08:23.699 --> 01:08:26.321]  The feds say you get more funding if you appoint this guy or gal.
[01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:27.481]  They start this.
[01:08:27.922 --> 01:08:34.145]  Now the bags over the heads, that's right out of 1984, in the real world, right out of Russia, right out of Nazi Germany.
[01:08:35.366 --> 01:08:38.487]  We have reports in Texas of them now when they arrest you.
[01:08:38.828 --> 01:08:41.769]  Even for traffic violations, bags are being put over heads.
[01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:43.510]  In one case, a plastic bag.
[01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:45.051]  A woman almost died.
[01:08:46.051 --> 01:08:47.712]  It's getting so abusive.
[01:08:48.453 --> 01:08:50.654]  Well, it's what the police do in Mexico City.
[01:08:52.322 --> 01:08:56.428]  And right here in Texas, they just had to pay a settlement and a lawsuit to Sandy Smith.
[01:08:58.030 --> 01:09:00.914]  Older woman, retired, no criminal record.
[01:09:01.575 --> 01:09:08.045]  They blocked off the street for a whole street of the neighborhood, raided the homes, National Guard with them, hit them, hit them hard.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.402]  The small 25-pound dog growled at police.
[01:09:11.442 --> 01:09:12.023]  They kicked it.
[01:09:12.463 --> 01:09:14.145]  Blood was coming out of the dog's mouth.
[01:09:14.685 --> 01:09:17.067]  They shoved the old woman down in fire ants.
[01:09:18.228 --> 01:09:24.133]  They raided the neighbors, pulled out a Playboy magazine, made fun of the neighbor, humiliating him.
[01:09:24.514 --> 01:09:25.515]  Look at your Playboy.
[01:09:25.555 --> 01:09:26.495]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:09:27.016 --> 01:09:28.177]  This was all over our news.
[01:09:28.277 --> 01:09:33.782]  The sheriff got on TV, Margo Frazier, and said on ABC News, we no longer need warrants.
[01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:36.312]  Now it's raiding neighborhoods.
[01:09:36.652 --> 01:09:42.617]  In a town in Missouri two years ago, AP headline, town searched in drug raid.
[01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:46.461]  Folks, this is as bad as it gets.
[01:09:46.541 --> 01:09:47.842]  They've trained with the military.
[01:09:47.862 --> 01:09:49.464]  They're getting rid of posse commentatus.
[01:09:49.804 --> 01:09:51.486]  Patriot Act II says for any...
[01:09:52.153 --> 01:10:00.859]  Perceived crime, any misdemeanor, any violation of state or federal law, life in prison, secret execution, Section 501.
[01:10:01.059 --> 01:10:03.821]  We've written the analysis on Infowars.com.
[01:10:04.161 --> 01:10:06.342]  Gun Owners of America has now written the analysis.
[01:10:06.723 --> 01:10:12.126]  Worse than mine, worse than mine, gun ownership, life in prison.
[01:10:12.406 --> 01:10:18.030]  They got a law by Senator Minnis there.
[01:10:18.811 --> 01:10:19.691]  We're about to go to our guest.
[01:10:19.751 --> 01:10:20.852]  I've just got to give him some background.
[01:10:21.534 --> 01:10:34.645]  Senator Minnis, a Republican, right there in Oregon, in Salem, we've read the bill on air, says life in prison if you violate any of these laws.
[01:10:34.745 --> 01:10:36.246]  And they list it as terrorism.
[01:10:36.326 --> 01:10:39.208]  If one protester blocks traffic, everyone gets life in prison.
[01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:44.533]  Any law, any gun crime, owning a gun you're not supposed to have, life in prison.
[01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:49.096]  But if you agree to 25 years in a forest work camp, I know you don't believe this.
[01:10:49.116 --> 01:10:50.898]  I ought to go pull the bill out again.
[01:10:51.838 --> 01:10:52.479]  We're good to go.
[01:10:52.499 --> 01:10:52.739]  I think?
[01:11:18.749 --> 01:11:21.773]  SWAT teams just come in, a dog growls, they blow it away.
[01:11:21.793 --> 01:11:24.216]  This is not America!
[01:11:25.638 --> 01:11:28.361]  And 99% of people this happens to don't sue.
[01:11:28.962 --> 01:11:30.644]  And a lot of times they plant drugs.
[01:11:31.806 --> 01:11:35.090]  In Lubbock, they raided a guy's home with no guns.
[01:11:36.013 --> 01:11:38.375]  His wife had divorced him or was leaving him.
[01:11:38.456 --> 01:11:39.216]  He threw a fit.
[01:11:40.117 --> 01:11:41.419]  She admits she didn't touch her.
[01:11:41.439 --> 01:11:44.982]  He threw a fit for her to throw in her furniture out the front lawn.
[01:11:45.022 --> 01:11:45.963]  He should have been arrested.
[01:11:45.983 --> 01:11:52.470]  The SWAT team came, went nuts, shot their own officers with an armored vehicle, killed one, injured another.
[01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:53.711]  A good cop blew the whistle.
[01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:56.373]  They were going to frame the man for shooting the officers.
[01:11:56.714 --> 01:11:57.695]  He didn't even have a gun.
[01:11:59.153 --> 01:12:00.394]  This is the new America.
[01:12:00.895 --> 01:12:03.598]  And I'm ranting and raving because it upsets me so badly.
[01:12:03.998 --> 01:12:06.060]  Lauren Regan, thank you for joining us.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.423]  You're the lawyer for these families in the raided neighborhood.
[01:12:09.443 --> 01:12:12.106]  I know you think you woke up in 1984.
[01:12:12.146 --> 01:12:13.227]  We appreciate you joining us.
[01:12:13.727 --> 01:12:14.108]  Thank you.
[01:12:14.948 --> 01:12:19.193]  Tell us about yourself, more about the raid, the black hoods.
[01:12:19.233 --> 01:12:20.494]  This is scarier than Russia.
[01:12:21.488 --> 01:12:28.655]  Well, I'm a civil rights attorney here in Eugene, which is a small residential area.
[01:12:28.675 --> 01:12:30.117]  There's 130,000 residents here.
[01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:31.879]  Let me stop you real quick.
[01:12:31.899 --> 01:12:34.301]  Did you hear about the bill with menace for life in prison?
[01:12:34.702 --> 01:12:35.162]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:35.202 --> 01:12:37.465]  Can you real quick for those, because I didn't have the bill in front of me today.
[01:12:37.525 --> 01:12:40.568]  I read it 25 times on air in its entirety, literally.
[01:12:40.908 --> 01:12:42.650]  But can you just mention what's in there?
[01:12:44.308 --> 01:12:50.932]  Well, all I know is that there's been several renditions of the bill introduced into our state legislature.
[01:12:51.032 --> 01:12:55.195]  Luckily, none of them have really gotten beyond committee.
[01:12:55.235 --> 01:12:56.295]  He is the head of the committee.
[01:12:56.776 --> 01:13:01.599]  He is, and he's definitely a problem to our legislature.
[01:13:01.639 --> 01:13:10.565]  And it says, anyone who blocks commerce or traffic or any citizen of Oregon, life in prison for the entire group, 25 years in a forced labor camp, if you agree to that.
[01:13:11.614 --> 01:13:29.001]  Yeah, you know, the earlier bill, they had attached the section to a sex crimes bill and added a provision saying that anything that could be deemed eco-terrorism, which kind of fell under the same definition that's used in the UPA, the Patriot Act.
[01:13:29.141 --> 01:13:33.102]  It goes after right-wing terrorists, left-wing terrorists, but they're not terrorists.
[01:13:33.963 --> 01:13:37.784]  In fact, it says anyone in the bill that reports an environmental dump
[01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:40.525]  Right.
[01:13:40.765 --> 01:13:42.927]  I know.
[01:13:43.047 --> 01:13:48.950]  It's definitely, I mean, the linchpin for it is to suppress the First Amendment rights, basically.
[01:13:48.990 --> 01:14:02.278]  You know, I mean, our government certainly does not like dissent, wants to silence that, and certainly most people who are going to go wave a flag or hang a banner or do any type of lawful civil disobedience
[01:14:04.095 --> 01:14:10.098]  It's a massive chilling effect, and if we let them chill what we're doing, it's going to be like Hitler and they're going to win.
[01:14:10.458 --> 01:14:11.479]  I'll stop jumping in.
[01:14:11.499 --> 01:14:12.579]  Tell us what happened.
[01:14:12.719 --> 01:14:13.380]  Tell us what happened.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.541]  Well, you laid out the basic framework.
[01:14:15.761 --> 01:14:20.423]  In this circumstance, you know, in about 7 o'clock in the morning,
[01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:28.311]  A light armored vehicle, which basically looks just like a tank, except it doesn't have the gun turret on the front of it.
[01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:31.293]  Well, by the way, this is a big East German one that you got hit by.
[01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:31.694]  Go ahead.
[01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:45.187]  Rolled down a small street in a residential neighborhood in Eugene, parked itself right up against the front porch of this house, threw a bunch of flashbang grenades into the backyard.
[01:14:45.743 --> 01:14:46.203]  I think so.
[01:15:11.247 --> 01:15:21.349]  And then, as you said, placed a black bag over her head and then paraded her in front of 50-plus police officers without any clothing on.
[01:15:21.369 --> 01:15:26.770]  And by the way, simultaneously, this was happening in Afghanistan.
[01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:27.890]  These guys are sickos.
[01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:29.790]  They wanted to be part of the fun.
[01:15:29.991 --> 01:15:31.811]  There's nothing like stomping on a woman.
[01:15:32.551 --> 01:15:37.792]  Yeah, when they, you know, Marcella says that when they put the bag over her head,
[01:15:39.157 --> 01:15:44.781]  All she could hear was yelling and dogs barking and screaming because it was a chaotic situation.
[01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:49.744]  And she was scared for her life that the next thing she was going to hear was a hail of bullets.
[01:15:50.645 --> 01:15:57.610]  The police officers that came into her homes were dressed in black armored gear.
[01:15:57.690 --> 01:15:59.472]  They had no badges visible.
[01:15:59.572 --> 01:16:02.334]  They were wearing black balaclava ski masks.
[01:16:03.195 --> 01:16:06.296]  And, you know, they didn't know what the hell was coming into their house.
[01:16:06.316 --> 01:16:09.136]  Ma'am, didn't you know the black ski mask is the symbol of a free country?
[01:16:09.156 --> 01:16:13.157]  I mean, they had Russian tax police 30 years ago that had black ski masks.
[01:16:13.177 --> 01:16:14.317]  What's wrong with black ski masks?
[01:16:15.177 --> 01:16:21.518]  Well, a little intimidating for normal citizens to have what, you know, what I call... Oh, you obviously haven't heard the latest.
[01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:26.439]  In Miami, they now wear a hockey mask with red horns.
[01:16:26.459 --> 01:16:27.479]  Oh, nice.
[01:16:28.059 --> 01:16:28.999]  Oh, yes.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.160]  I have video of it.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.020]  Stay there.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:31.720]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:32.381 --> 01:16:33.422]  Please stay with me, ma'am.
[01:16:33.682 --> 01:16:35.083]  I want to hear everything.
[01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:38.146]  You've written an incredible analysis of this.
[01:16:38.946 --> 01:16:40.348]  And it's all coming up when we get back.
[01:16:40.368 --> 01:16:41.408]  Stay with us.

[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:46.124]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:18:46.565 --> 01:18:51.109]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:18:51.509 --> 01:18:56.374]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:18:56.734 --> 01:18:58.516]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[01:18:58.576 --> 01:18:59.597]  can barely be read.
[01:18:59.897 --> 01:19:00.838]  It has faded that much.
[01:19:01.198 --> 01:19:05.099]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.

[01:20:25.437 --> 01:20:25.718]  Call today.
[01:20:54.196 --> 01:21:17.945]  Maybe there's something wrong with me, but when I go out and cover news stories here in Austin where old women are shoved down in fire ants and kicked and their dogs are kicked and whole neighborhoods are searched and sheriffs get up on TV and laugh about it and when I see the reports everywhere and now it's naked women with black bags over their head, no drugs found, so they just go ahead and charge them anyways.
[01:21:18.505 --> 01:21:19.585]  This is the new trend.
[01:21:20.606 --> 01:21:21.686]  The new trend in America.
[01:21:22.797 --> 01:21:24.158]  And it's happened in history before.
[01:21:24.218 --> 01:21:25.238]  Governments become criminal.
[01:21:25.459 --> 01:21:28.720]  They become delusional and mentally ill and think they're allowed to act like all this.
[01:21:29.541 --> 01:21:34.043]  As we know, the government ships in the narcotics for profits and then to break down society and then to pack the prisons.
[01:21:34.684 --> 01:21:40.247]  We're joined by the lawyer for this group of people in the neighborhood that were raided, no drugs found, Lauren Regan.
[01:21:40.847 --> 01:21:48.611]  And you can read her analysis and other mainstream reports at InfoWars.com or go to Portland.IndyMedia.org to get some of the other articles.
[01:21:49.491 --> 01:21:50.232]  Continuing...
[01:21:51.747 --> 01:21:59.149]  What was it like for the women, especially, being drug around naked with black bags on their heads by men who didn't even identify themselves wearing black uniforms?
[01:21:59.429 --> 01:22:00.110]  What was that like?
[01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:07.092]  Well, I certainly can't even relate the horror that both of them felt.
[01:22:07.252 --> 01:22:13.554]  I think they both are continuing to go to counseling, and I think this will impact them for the rest of their lives.
[01:22:13.834 --> 01:22:17.735]  You hear stories like this, and you think, oh, that's terrible, but
[01:22:18.174 --> 01:22:18.574]  We're good to go.
[01:22:48.468 --> 01:23:02.754]  Well, a lot of police officers are now talking about, some of the older ones, that SWAT teams are actually getting cops killed.
[01:23:03.635 --> 01:23:06.276]  And how you bust somebody is you park down the street.
[01:23:06.896 --> 01:23:09.417]  When the perp leaves in the morning, you do a little work.
[01:23:09.437 --> 01:23:10.798]  You surveil them for a couple days.
[01:23:11.502 --> 01:23:11.742]  Right.
[01:23:11.802 --> 01:23:12.022]  Right.
[01:23:12.042 --> 01:23:16.205]  I mean, this show has a really abusive, psychotic nature to drag a naked woman outside with a black hood on.
[01:23:16.265 --> 01:23:16.425]  Go ahead.
[01:23:37.176 --> 01:23:39.298]  And it's not really only these women either.
[01:23:39.338 --> 01:24:00.338]  I mean, the next-door neighbor was a public school teacher who was trying to go to work that morning, and she walked out to get into her car, and there was a man with an automatic rifle pointed at her wearing a ski mask, and she asked the officer if it was okay for her to get in her car and go to work, and the cop replied, I haven't shot anybody in two weeks.
[01:24:01.195 --> 01:24:05.438]  That was the response that this officer gave to the innocent civilians.
[01:24:05.498 --> 01:24:10.222]  No, they do psychological profiles for mentally ill psychopaths, yeah.
[01:24:10.362 --> 01:24:15.626]  You know, they wear shirts that say on the raid, somebody going to die and stuff like that.
[01:24:15.646 --> 01:24:17.147]  That's kind of friendly, isn't it?
[01:24:17.487 --> 01:24:17.727]  Yeah.
[01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:30.497]  The other important thing about this case, other than just, again, trying to hold back the flood of paramilitary use in police force, the other really troubling part of this case for us is...
[01:24:30.930 --> 01:24:32.111]  Or National Guard.
[01:24:32.131 --> 01:24:32.231]  Right.
[01:24:52.382 --> 01:24:52.963]  I think we're good.
[01:25:15.427 --> 01:25:18.448]  Boy, they didn't have money or resources to go to a lawyer.
[01:25:18.828 --> 01:25:28.952]  And so I think the severity of police abuse in raids like this by SWAT teams is probably much more widespread than we even realize.
[01:25:29.213 --> 01:25:32.194]  Well, I scan news wires probably more than anybody else.
[01:25:32.474 --> 01:25:39.117]  And I see about, oh, let's be conservative, 30, 40 of these a day around the country.
[01:25:39.837 --> 01:25:43.238]  Every week, cops killing innocent people or shooting their own officers.
[01:25:43.878 --> 01:25:45.099]  It is a scourge.
[01:25:46.112 --> 01:25:51.097]  It may actually overbalance other organized crime activities for the entire country.
[01:25:51.877 --> 01:25:59.244]  Yeah, the reaction from the local people here, I mean, the majority of citizens were just shocked and appalled.
[01:25:59.324 --> 01:26:06.291]  They had never heard of this type of tactic being used, and they couldn't believe that it was allowed in civilian settings like this.
[01:26:06.835 --> 01:26:12.076]  And they developed a commission now to review slot team tactics.
[01:26:12.477 --> 01:26:19.178]  But I'm sure you know there's been several cities across the country now that have completely done away with their slot teams.
[01:26:19.198 --> 01:26:21.639]  Yeah, because you get so many cops killed, mainly.
[01:26:21.659 --> 01:26:22.039]  Stay there.
[01:26:22.059 --> 01:26:22.939]  One more segment.
[01:26:22.959 --> 01:26:24.260]  We really appreciate you coming on.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.741]  Lauren Regan, the lawyer for these families.
[01:26:27.761 --> 01:26:30.842]  More of the horror of America with a K when we get back.
[01:26:32.962 --> 01:26:33.882]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.363 --> 01:26:35.883]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.881 --> 01:26:39.664]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.967 --> 01:26:44.629]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:26:44.949 --> 01:26:50.695]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:26:50.955 --> 01:26:54.278]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the water crisis.
[01:26:54.458 --> 01:26:55.419]  The choice is yours.
[01:26:55.659 --> 01:26:56.941]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit ThePowerHour.com.
[01:27:04.025 --> 01:27:04.867]  We're good to go.
[01:27:21.961 --> 01:27:23.902]  All right, folks, Alex Jones back live.
[01:27:23.922 --> 01:27:26.544]  And if you're not angry, if you're not upset, something's wrong with you.
[01:27:26.724 --> 01:27:32.548]  Folks know that I've produced a couple films about the police state, about the SWAT teams, how they train with the military.
[01:27:33.489 --> 01:27:42.755]  And under the federal government, it expanded under Bill Clinton, it's exploded under George W. Ridge has announced they want to, quote, get rid of hossy commentatus.
[01:27:44.059 --> 01:27:48.701]  Our troops now, in over ten cases, mow down hundreds of Iraqis when they protest.
[01:27:49.122 --> 01:27:50.903]  In many cases, they don't even shoot back.
[01:27:51.443 --> 01:27:58.446]  The AP got caught planning fake stories that the Iraqis had a sign that said, we're going to kill you, when it said, get out, killers.
[01:27:59.147 --> 01:28:05.130]  These troops are going to come back, become police officers, trained in Tiananmen Square oppression.
[01:28:06.627 --> 01:28:18.435]  And they said they're getting rid of posse comitatus with the military terminology, the military mindset of oppressing the people, dragging women out naked, bags on their heads, screaming and cussing at you.
[01:28:19.176 --> 01:28:21.958]  And if they shoot one of their own officers, they're going to frame you.
[01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:25.340]  If they shoot you, they're going to drop a gun.
[01:28:26.269 --> 01:28:31.971]  And this family is very, this group of families, very lucky that no drugs were dropped.
[01:28:32.131 --> 01:28:38.093]  These officers are probably just idiots, not criminals, because a lot of times they've been caught doing this.
[01:28:38.273 --> 01:28:42.754]  Major press reports on a monthly basis, I see, on SWAT teams planning stuff.
[01:28:43.314 --> 01:28:45.016]  Well, luckily, Patriot Act II...
[01:29:11.385 --> 01:29:12.625]  Isn't a threat to us yet.
[01:29:12.645 --> 01:29:16.886]  Well, actually, ma'am, they're passing sections of it.
[01:29:17.167 --> 01:29:17.487]  Yeah.
[01:29:17.867 --> 01:29:25.249]  Well, luckily, Eugene is one of the communities that has passed a resolution not to uphold the UPA.
[01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:27.449]  So we have a little bit of leeway there.
[01:29:27.569 --> 01:29:38.872]  But certainly it's intimidating the idea that now we're going to rely on judges in federal courts, many of which are Bush or Reagan appointees.
[01:29:39.682 --> 01:29:45.623]  To determine what is a reasonable use of force in civilian circumstances like this.
[01:29:46.003 --> 01:30:06.347]  The final outgrowth of this case and all of these other cases is that a group of individuals are going to decide for all of us where the line is going to be drawn in the sand, whether this type of military tactic is what we have to look forward to in the future as far as being citizens of this country.
[01:30:06.946 --> 01:30:07.307]  Thank you.
[01:30:07.427 --> 01:30:07.928]  Thank you.
[01:30:23.686 --> 01:30:29.610]  Make it clear to law enforcement that this is not a community standard that we want put forward.
[01:30:29.670 --> 01:30:32.872]  Lauren, you may have missed it, but I said Bill Clinton.
[01:30:33.312 --> 01:30:34.853]  It exploded under Bill Clinton.
[01:30:35.574 --> 01:30:37.015]  It's gotten even bigger under Bush.
[01:30:37.095 --> 01:30:42.658]  I'm telling you, did you know Democrats voted in the Senate overwhelmingly for the Patriot Act?
[01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:45.480]  They added some of the bad provisions Ashcroft wanted.
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.541]  So I'm telling you this is bipartisan.
[01:30:47.581 --> 01:30:49.803]  Oh yeah, I'm not claiming it to be partisan.
[01:30:50.163 --> 01:30:51.944]  Well, look at Senator Menace.
[01:30:51.984 --> 01:30:52.784]  He's a Republican.
[01:30:53.064 --> 01:30:55.145]  He's the chairman of the Law Enforcement Committee.
[01:30:55.585 --> 01:30:56.846]  This is what they want.
[01:30:57.286 --> 01:30:58.207]  Life in prison.
[01:30:58.247 --> 01:30:59.007]  Folks, it says it.
[01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:02.409]  If one person blocks traffic, everyone gets life in prison.
[01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:04.710]  Now, it says that word for word.
[01:31:04.730 --> 01:31:06.390]  It's been in your news.
[01:31:06.610 --> 01:31:08.451]  This is how crazy it's gotten.
[01:31:09.232 --> 01:31:11.873]  How have the police behaved since this happened?
[01:31:12.613 --> 01:31:16.295]  Well, as far as I know, which, again, as I said, who knows?
[01:31:17.031 --> 01:31:19.772]  But as far as I know, there haven't been other incidents like this.
[01:31:19.992 --> 01:31:30.335]  But right before this incident happened in a town about 20 miles away, we had a SWAT unit go into a mobile home park and just shoot it up.
[01:31:31.075 --> 01:31:42.158]  There were bullets found in neighbors' mobile homes all over this area, and it was a mentally ill gentleman that was eventually apprehended without weapons on him at all.
[01:31:43.824 --> 01:31:49.709]  We're hoping that the attention that this case is getting is really going to send a clear message.
[01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:58.457]  The other facet... Let me just tell you, I had a family member, the second cousin, down in Houston.
[01:31:59.753 --> 01:32:02.556]  She was an older cousin, I guess what you call a great cousin.
[01:32:02.597 --> 01:32:16.113]  Some of her medication, just for medical stuff, not even mental stuff, got mixed up and she was bumping into things, called 911, said, I need an ambulance, I don't feel well, I don't know who I am.
[01:32:16.713 --> 01:32:17.694]  They came to the house.
[01:32:17.974 --> 01:32:19.155]  She didn't know any firearms.
[01:32:19.395 --> 01:32:22.477]  Blew her guts and her head all over the walls.
[01:32:22.877 --> 01:32:24.318]  They said, I didn't see it.
[01:32:24.378 --> 01:32:25.579]  My family was all freaked out.
[01:32:25.619 --> 01:32:26.419]  They're closer to her.
[01:32:26.819 --> 01:32:28.060]  They couldn't have an open casket.
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:29.201]  No one could repair the body.
[01:32:29.501 --> 01:32:37.206]  It was just a bloodthirsty, almost demonic, vampiric feeding that took place machine gunning her.
[01:32:37.566 --> 01:32:38.987]  They just opened the door and shot her to death.
[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:40.561]  Yeah.
[01:32:40.581 --> 01:32:48.610]  The other issue that's getting a lot of attention here, Oregon is in one of the worst budget crises, I think, of all 50 states.
[01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:50.792]  Our courts are closed one day a week.
[01:32:51.112 --> 01:32:54.436]  We can't provide court-appointed attorneys for people who are arrested.
[01:32:54.992 --> 01:33:00.354]  I mean, there are such budget shortfalls here that schools are closing months early.
[01:33:00.674 --> 01:33:04.415]  You know that was done on purpose so they can pass the satellite tracker box in your car.
[01:33:04.435 --> 01:33:05.736]  You know your state's about to do that.
[01:33:06.036 --> 01:33:13.378]  You know governments will artificially cut services claiming that they don't have money so they can then put in more police state, and that's the plan.
[01:33:14.218 --> 01:33:17.059]  You might check into the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:18.500]  I've looked at your state's budget.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:20.521]  Did you know they actually have a secret slush fund?
[01:33:20.541 --> 01:33:21.321]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:21.912 --> 01:33:31.696]  Yeah, well, and law enforcement every year for several years has tried to pass bond measures that the taxpayers have solidly turned down every single time.
[01:33:32.096 --> 01:33:39.359]  But yet law enforcement doesn't get the message that they're not doing community policing like this community wants them to.
[01:33:40.097 --> 01:33:40.897]  Yeah, this was, this was,
[01:34:09.102 --> 01:34:14.764]  Three homes that Marcella Monroe and Tam Davidge owned.
[01:34:14.924 --> 01:34:20.666]  One of the houses they lived in, the other house was where Elizabeth and Jor lived in, their tenants.
[01:34:20.966 --> 01:34:21.926]  So they were rent houses?
[01:34:22.587 --> 01:34:22.807]  What?
[01:34:23.367 --> 01:34:24.187]  Rent houses.
[01:34:24.967 --> 01:34:31.209]  And the third house they had gutted and were entirely remodeling, and it was totally empty.
[01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:35.631]  And the police knew this because they had been surveilling the house for several months.
[01:34:36.272 --> 01:34:45.416]  So the police, the one defense that the police have openly stated in the newspapers is that the properties were quote-unquote complex.
[01:34:46.016 --> 01:34:51.138]  And so that somehow justified them bringing in this tank and the raid the way they did.
[01:34:51.158 --> 01:34:52.719]  Now let me ask you another question here.
[01:34:53.675 --> 01:34:55.436]  Yeah, well, that's just a bunch of diversions.
[01:34:55.816 --> 01:34:57.637]  They just like to do this, and the feds have funded them.
[01:34:57.657 --> 01:35:00.659]  They want this mindset, so they're just practicing it instead of the president.
[01:35:01.239 --> 01:35:01.539]  What?
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:07.462]  Now, they still went ahead and cited them and arrested them and did all this with felony charges.
[01:35:07.522 --> 01:35:15.487]  We're seeing this more and more, where they pull an old lady over, no drugs, a robber of $3,000 or $4,000 just happened north of Austin last year.
[01:35:15.887 --> 01:35:18.648]  They take the money and say, hey, it's up to you to prove it's yours.
[01:35:19.048 --> 01:35:19.849]  What happened here?
[01:35:20.743 --> 01:35:24.347]  Well, they seized a bunch of my clients' properties.
[01:35:27.150 --> 01:35:31.414]  One of the clients is a jewelry maker, and so he had a jewelry shop in the basement.
[01:35:31.734 --> 01:35:35.198]  And they would seize a 60-second timer.
[01:35:35.856 --> 01:35:36.196]  Hold on.
[01:35:36.216 --> 01:35:39.718]  For those that don't know, they call that paraphernalia under the Rave Act.
[01:35:39.738 --> 01:35:44.981]  Air-conditioned rooms, bottled waters, glow sticks, whole venues can now be seized.
[01:35:45.101 --> 01:35:46.281]  That's the new mindset.
[01:35:46.321 --> 01:35:46.742]  Go ahead.
[01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:03.530]  The other woman is a landscaper.
[01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:10.692]  She had a bunch of potting soil and over 500 potted plants out in her yard.
[01:36:10.992 --> 01:36:17.614]  They never mentioned the 500 potted plants, but they seized up the potting soil and said, aha, drugs.
[01:36:18.214 --> 01:36:25.736]  And then one of the houses that was being remodeled, the reason it was being remodeled is because a giant tree fell through the roof of it.
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:30.124]  And they had black plastic covering up the hole in the roof.
[01:36:30.685 --> 01:36:35.850]  The police seized a roll of this black plastic and said, aha, drug lab, again.
[01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:38.834]  So there were various items like that that were seized.
[01:36:39.054 --> 01:36:40.115]  Well, this is what's weird.
[01:36:40.155 --> 01:36:41.517]  They only want to go after property.
[01:36:42.297 --> 01:36:48.164]  Here in Austin, literal crack dealers line the downtown streets in certain areas.
[01:36:49.466 --> 01:36:49.786]  I think?
[01:37:12.783 --> 01:37:16.265]  I mean, there are really unsavory characters at this gas station.
[01:37:17.325 --> 01:37:18.626]  There's prostitution.
[01:37:19.066 --> 01:37:20.087]  There's drug dealing.
[01:37:20.107 --> 01:37:21.868]  I live in a moderately nice neighborhood.
[01:37:22.228 --> 01:37:24.209]  I just said, you guys need to go check this gas station.
[01:37:24.689 --> 01:37:26.230]  That was four or five months ago.
[01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:27.810]  Nothing's been done.
[01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:36.915]  It is a public crack house on a major road on Manchac in Austin, and they will not do anything.
[01:37:36.935 --> 01:37:37.215]  Go ahead.
[01:37:39.126 --> 01:37:39.807]  Oh, let's see.
[01:37:40.007 --> 01:37:53.474]  Well, so they seized up a bunch of their personal property and then about a couple months later they admitted that they were not going to be filing official charges against these people and they returned all of the evidence to them.
[01:37:55.216 --> 01:37:55.456]  I think so.
[01:38:15.135 --> 01:38:25.203]  And they got a giant stack of them back, but there's just no way to tell whether this stuff has been copied and so that their personal documents are now in some files somewhere.
[01:38:25.283 --> 01:38:27.745]  Oh, we know they create huge files.
[01:38:27.865 --> 01:38:31.208]  Yeah, and this is people who had no prior convictions whatsoever.
[01:38:32.068 --> 01:38:35.371]  They hadn't even ever had their fingerprints taken.
[01:38:36.091 --> 01:38:40.575]  Their privacy was extremely intact for most citizens today.
[01:38:40.595 --> 01:38:43.017]  And so that invasion of privacy...
[01:38:43.690 --> 01:38:46.852]  Um, has had some serious ramifications on them as well.
[01:38:46.912 --> 01:38:49.094]  So you're now suing them, a federal lawsuit?
[01:38:49.374 --> 01:38:49.855]  We are.
[01:38:49.875 --> 01:38:50.535]  We are.
[01:38:50.655 --> 01:38:52.176]  It's going to be a lengthy one.
[01:38:53.177 --> 01:38:54.978]  Um, we'll see what happens.
[01:38:55.799 --> 01:38:57.260]  We're just at the early stages right now.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.902]  Now in Austin, they just went ahead and settled with Sandy Smith.
[01:38:59.922 --> 01:39:01.303]  Are you going to give them an offer to settle?
[01:39:02.324 --> 01:39:04.565]  Well, we haven't been given an offer to settle yet.
[01:39:04.806 --> 01:39:09.429]  The city has officially stated to the newspapers that the matter is under investigation.
[01:39:09.449 --> 01:39:09.489]  Um...
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:34.495]  You know, we're hoping that the SWAT team task force that is being set up by the city will possibly come up with some better policies to rein in this abusive power, but we're just going to have to see what progress they make, what resolutions they come up with, and whether that's going to adequately protect the community from acts like this that might happen.
[01:39:34.515 --> 01:39:36.596]  Now, the suit's also against the National Guard.
[01:39:36.636 --> 01:39:37.337]  What happens there?
[01:39:38.385 --> 01:39:38.905]  What do you mean?
[01:39:39.226 --> 01:39:41.467]  Well, I mean, you list the National Guard in the lawsuit.
[01:39:41.867 --> 01:39:44.929]  Right, because they were the owners and drivers of the tank.
[01:39:45.409 --> 01:39:50.932]  So for those that don't know, troops, military, were assisting the police.
[01:39:50.952 --> 01:39:52.493]  And you go, oh, well, those are National Guard.
[01:39:52.533 --> 01:39:55.915]  No, they've been federalized since the mid-'90s, for those that didn't know.
[01:39:57.436 --> 01:40:07.502]  Yeah, it's going to be... That facet of it is going to be really interesting, because like you said, there have been such serious erosions to the Posse Comitatus that...
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:11.481]  We're basically going to have to argue that it was excessive.
[01:40:12.021 --> 01:40:14.422]  It's basically going to be an excessive force claim.
[01:40:14.822 --> 01:40:21.084]  Given what they knew about this particular circumstance, was the use of force necessary?
[01:40:21.564 --> 01:40:25.606]  Did it create an unsafe circumstance for these people and their neighbors?
[01:40:26.286 --> 01:40:28.227]  And then the policy issue is
[01:40:29.534 --> 01:40:33.577]  Is this the way we want police to do drug raids in this town?
[01:40:33.597 --> 01:40:34.578]  Well, give me a break.
[01:40:34.598 --> 01:40:35.498]  The border's wide open.
[01:40:35.518 --> 01:40:36.459]  They ship it all in.
[01:40:37.099 --> 01:40:39.321]  Then it destabilizes the entire society.
[01:40:39.341 --> 01:40:44.525]  I'm looking at a picture of a similar armored vehicle.
[01:40:44.545 --> 01:40:48.968]  I mean, this is a gigantic... This is one of the heavy ones, like the Marines drive.
[01:40:49.608 --> 01:40:52.530]  I can't tell from the photo whether it's the Marine version or the East German.
[01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:54.231]  No, that's a Marine version, LAV.
[01:40:55.172 --> 01:40:56.313]  And, wow...
[01:40:57.563 --> 01:40:59.544]  I mean, this is the new America.
[01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:09.190]  I don't know what you can say about this other than the fact that... Now, why drag the woman out with her clothes off, with the bag on the head?
[01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:12.092]  Is this just some added enjoyment they carry out, or what was that about?
[01:41:12.472 --> 01:41:18.716]  Well, after they had taken her to the ground, you know, hit her head to the ground, stood on her neck and back...
[01:41:19.557 --> 01:41:27.799]  She began to bring her out into this public area where all the police officers and, you know, the sidewalk and the town are standing.
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:31.460]  She asked if she could at least please put on some clothes.
[01:41:31.801 --> 01:41:36.862]  And this woman is very pretty, blonde, very, you know, sweet voice.
[01:41:37.502 --> 01:41:41.303]  And she just, you know, crying, she asked if she could at least put some clothes on.
[01:41:41.863 --> 01:41:47.525]  And the police officer's response was to take the black bag out of his pocket and just put it over her head
[01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:51.733]  With no explanation whatsoever.
[01:41:51.813 --> 01:41:53.974]  Well, that is false arrest.
[01:41:54.054 --> 01:41:55.455]  There's humiliation there.
[01:41:55.996 --> 01:41:58.417]  There's civil damages all over the place.
[01:41:59.798 --> 01:42:01.680]  There's the psychological damages.
[01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:05.242]  And, I mean, that guy is just a sack of pus.
[01:42:05.302 --> 01:42:06.043]  What is his name?
[01:42:07.033 --> 01:42:07.893]  We don't know yet.
[01:42:08.333 --> 01:42:10.334]  Oh, black ski masks, no badges, yeah.
[01:42:10.454 --> 01:42:12.214]  Yeah, they didn't have badges on.
[01:42:12.534 --> 01:42:13.835]  Notice how it's the opposite, though.
[01:42:13.855 --> 01:42:16.996]  Did you hear about how a guy barked back at a police dog that barked at him?
[01:42:17.456 --> 01:42:18.816]  They're charging him on a year in jail.
[01:42:18.836 --> 01:42:21.237]  Another guy got two years in prison for barking at a dog.
[01:42:21.557 --> 01:42:23.337]  They'll shoot our dogs, nothing happens.
[01:42:23.817 --> 01:42:29.218]  They're all covered, their names covered, their faces covered, but they'll drag a woman out naked down the street.
[01:42:29.519 --> 01:42:30.179]  It's real funny.
[01:42:30.499 --> 01:42:35.400]  Yeah, there were two dogs in this circumstance, and luckily the owner of the dogs
[01:42:35.982 --> 01:42:38.544]  Was allowed at gunpoint.
[01:42:38.785 --> 01:42:46.831]  The police held him at gunpoint and marched him across the backyard to put the dogs in the kennel and then marched him back at gunpoint.
[01:42:46.851 --> 01:42:47.392]  That's strange.
[01:42:47.432 --> 01:42:50.855]  Was there more attention and abuse then to the luscious female?
[01:42:52.009 --> 01:43:00.195]  Well, I don't know that I would necessarily say that, but I think that both owners were really... It sounds like it.
[01:43:00.215 --> 01:43:06.720]  You got the man getting marched around with dogs, and you got this naked blonde with the cops in their demon outfits salivating.
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:14.105]  Well, I think that both of them, both husband and wife, were equally brutalized by the event in different ways.
[01:43:14.846 --> 01:43:16.307]  I think that anyone...
[01:43:16.909 --> 01:43:26.491]  Would probably have a scar on their memory for the rest of their lives if they were marched with a gun to their head across their own backyard, not understanding what was going on.
[01:43:26.671 --> 01:43:32.892]  Well, I had a guy at gunpoint rob me, and I still remember that.
[01:43:33.312 --> 01:43:38.973]  Sometimes if I'm walking into a convenience store and somebody walks up, Hey, buddy, want some change for this day?
[01:43:38.993 --> 01:43:40.294]  Can I have some change?
[01:43:40.354 --> 01:43:41.094]  I'll say, Get back!
[01:43:41.154 --> 01:43:41.674]  Just because...
[01:43:42.354 --> 01:43:45.135]  Somebody did that and robbed me when I was about 17.
[01:43:45.175 --> 01:43:46.016]  Right.
[01:43:46.276 --> 01:43:46.996]  And I'm a man.
[01:43:47.076 --> 01:43:50.297]  I can't imagine what it's like for these people, this happening inside their house.
[01:43:50.617 --> 01:44:02.442]  Yeah, every time, you know, we've gone to a couple different community forums, and we've done some media, and every time I bring my clients to a public event, as soon as I start talking about it,
[01:44:07.297 --> 01:44:10.779]  I think the answer is you can find out who was on that SWAT team.
[01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:12.681]  You can go to one of their training drills.
[01:44:12.981 --> 01:44:14.081]  You can stand up to them.
[01:44:14.121 --> 01:44:15.562]  I've done this in grocery stores to them.
[01:44:15.862 --> 01:44:18.304]  And I'll say, hey, you shouldn't have done what you did there.
[01:44:18.324 --> 01:44:21.686]  Or I'll say, I know you guys killed your own officer.
[01:44:21.706 --> 01:44:23.467]  And they'll go, how do you know who we are?
[01:44:23.487 --> 01:44:25.448]  And I go, well, I went to one of your training ops.
[01:44:26.537 --> 01:44:27.518]  Yeah, we know who you are.
[01:44:27.558 --> 01:44:28.339]  We have video of you.
[01:44:28.359 --> 01:44:29.580]  You don't like that, do you?
[01:44:29.961 --> 01:44:31.502]  You're a public servant, buddy.
[01:44:31.962 --> 01:44:33.724]  You're a criminal for what you've done.
[01:44:33.744 --> 01:44:41.772]  And that's how I get some of my humanity back, is I stand up to them when they don't have their little bike robber mask on.
[01:44:41.832 --> 01:44:42.953]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:44:43.013 --> 01:44:48.758]  Well, hopefully jurors will feel similarly to you, and we'll be able to create some good precedent for other people.
[01:44:48.778 --> 01:44:49.099]  All right.
[01:44:49.119 --> 01:44:51.521]  Lauren Regan, any websites we need to check out?
[01:44:52.501 --> 01:44:54.864]  I think you mentioned the Indy Media site.
[01:44:55.024 --> 01:44:57.486]  There's quite an active discussion going on.
[01:44:57.686 --> 01:45:00.770]  Thank you for coming on while I rant and rave, and thank you for your great work.
[01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.851]  Godspeed to you.
[01:45:01.871 --> 01:45:02.511]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:02.572 --> 01:45:02.812]  Thank you.
[01:45:04.824 --> 01:45:12.194]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:45:12.474 --> 01:45:17.200]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:23.088]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:45:23.308 --> 01:45:24.049]  We're good to go.
[01:45:42.684 --> 01:45:49.428]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:45:49.628 --> 01:45:54.871]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:54.891 --> 01:45:55.312]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:46:03.610 --> 01:46:07.091]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:46:07.351 --> 01:46:10.872]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:46:10.952 --> 01:46:14.893]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:46:15.114 --> 01:46:21.275]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:21.696 --> 01:46:29.598]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:46:30.018 --> 01:46:35.362]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:46:35.522 --> 01:46:39.285]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:46:39.645 --> 01:46:41.506]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:46:41.566 --> 01:46:43.728]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:46:43.988 --> 01:46:48.911]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:46:48.951 --> 01:46:54.515]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:46:57.897 --> 01:47:01.759]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:09.883]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:12.364]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:47:12.564 --> 01:47:18.907]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:47:19.247 --> 01:47:19.907]  We're good to go.
[01:47:39.673 --> 01:47:40.114]  We're good to go.
[01:48:04.813 --> 01:48:07.554]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:48:07.574 --> 01:48:11.495]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:13.776 --> 01:48:18.037]  You know, I know I get excited on subjects like this because it's just, I don't like bullies.
[01:48:19.217 --> 01:48:20.758]  These SWAT teams are nutty.
[01:48:20.798 --> 01:48:25.139]  I'm not saying all of them, but most of them, they're like mental patients or something.
[01:48:25.759 --> 01:48:29.981]  I mean, I see them on TV now in Miami and they wear hockey masks with red horns.
[01:48:30.601 --> 01:48:30.941]  Ha ha!
[01:48:31.713 --> 01:48:33.914]  Well, it's about intimidation to keep our men safe.
[01:48:34.134 --> 01:48:35.115]  Devil outfits.
[01:48:36.135 --> 01:48:41.058]  And they've all got, like, black widows and skull and crossbones and cobras on their arm patches.
[01:48:41.118 --> 01:48:47.040]  And I've seen video of training ops where they wear shirts like somebody gonna die or natural-born killers.
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:50.862]  And then imagine, they've been raiding the house for three or four hours.
[01:48:50.942 --> 01:48:52.003]  It's now early morning.
[01:48:53.343 --> 01:48:57.165]  Or later in the morning, seven o'clock, school teacher comes out, needs to back her car out.
[01:48:58.046 --> 01:49:00.567]  Officer, it's okay if I go?
[01:49:01.392 --> 01:49:04.154]  I hadn't killed anybody in a couple of weeks.
[01:49:04.734 --> 01:49:07.396]  I mean, what is... Come on!
[01:49:08.116 --> 01:49:09.297]  And folks, I've been around them.
[01:49:09.417 --> 01:49:10.077]  I've seen it.
[01:49:11.718 --> 01:49:22.084]  I mean, these are like guys that weren't tough or something in school or didn't do good at football and their dad was mean to them, was all about, you gotta be tough, boy, you gotta be tough, and they weren't tough.
[01:49:22.364 --> 01:49:23.104]  They're wimps.
[01:49:23.805 --> 01:49:24.585]  They weren't tough.
[01:49:24.665 --> 01:49:29.168]  Anybody who's really tough, unless they're really mentally ill, and those are even rarer,
[01:49:30.726 --> 01:49:32.407]  Are not into abusing weak people.
[01:49:34.088 --> 01:49:38.291]  You know, people that are tough like to fight tough people.
[01:49:39.992 --> 01:49:54.760]  I mean, I don't know, I want to say speaking from experience, but I'm not into being a tough guy, but I instinctively have just these adrenal feelings of anger and aggression towards anyone that abuses little people.
[01:49:55.581 --> 01:49:58.003]  It just makes my blood boil!
[01:49:58.103 --> 01:49:59.805]  I'm so sick of it!
[01:50:01.366 --> 01:50:07.531]  Folks, the tyranny they're setting up is the most dirty, stinking, rotten type I've ever seen in any country.
[01:50:09.412 --> 01:50:10.954]  And still, this is America.
[01:50:10.974 --> 01:50:11.694]  It can't happen here.
[01:50:11.714 --> 01:50:16.838]  Well, when it happens to you, your neighbors aren't going to help you, and it won't be on the news, and you'll think, man, don't people know about this?
[01:50:17.099 --> 01:50:18.980]  Mr. Jones, I laughed at you for years.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:19.561]  It's true.
[01:50:21.082 --> 01:50:21.502]  It's true.
[01:50:21.542 --> 01:50:21.923]  You know, the...
[01:50:23.211 --> 01:50:29.116]  The lieutenant governor in South Carolina ran a red light late to getting to a key vote.
[01:50:29.957 --> 01:50:31.318]  The officer pulled him out of the car.
[01:50:31.458 --> 01:50:33.940]  Admittedly, pulled a gun on him and pistol-whipped him.
[01:50:35.301 --> 01:50:43.348]  You know, you guys are going to find out, people that are powerful out there, your kid's going to be in the wrong place at the wrong time with these thugs.
[01:50:44.369 --> 01:50:45.790]  It's out of control, folks.
[01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:47.051]  Out of control.
[01:50:47.692 --> 01:50:49.533]  We have got to do something about this.
[01:50:49.593 --> 01:50:50.474]  We have got to...
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.821]  To stifle this out-of-control behavior.
[01:50:55.321 --> 01:50:57.802]  The crime rate's only gone up, by the way, in places that have all this.
[01:50:57.882 --> 01:50:59.043]  And more cops get killed.
[01:50:59.063 --> 01:51:02.244]  You know, I care about the police that are getting killed by their own SWAT team people.
[01:51:02.804 --> 01:51:05.885]  Can you imagine, though, how the government would behave if we didn't have our guns?
[01:51:05.945 --> 01:51:07.206]  Well, that's why they want them so bad.
[01:51:07.828 --> 01:51:10.751]  All right, the third hour will be an absolute news overload blitz.
[01:51:10.831 --> 01:51:12.593]  I've got 50 articles I haven't gotten to.
[01:51:13.073 --> 01:51:13.874]  I will get to them.
[01:51:14.215 --> 01:51:15.296]  I will get to your calls.
[01:51:15.316 --> 01:51:15.996]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:51:16.036 --> 01:51:23.764]  But before I end this hour, I am so proud and excited to announce that I am now done.
[01:51:24.905 --> 01:51:29.650]  And it's rolling off the press with Police State 3 total enslavement.
[01:51:32.395 --> 01:51:32.875]  We're good to go.
[01:51:32.895 --> 01:51:33.476]  We're good to go.
[01:51:59.825 --> 01:52:06.267]  $25.95, professionally produced, but if you order three or more of any of my eight videos, they drop down to $20 apiece.
[01:52:07.047 --> 01:52:10.828]  Of course, I have 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, about 9-1-1.
[01:52:11.828 --> 01:52:14.049]  The book, Descent into Tyranny, is only $12.
[01:52:14.469 --> 01:52:15.849]  Call right now.
[01:52:16.469 --> 01:52:17.249]  Order today.
[01:52:17.329 --> 01:52:18.309]  Support the broadcast.
[01:52:18.329 --> 01:52:19.010]  Get the videos.
[01:52:19.070 --> 01:52:19.670]  Make copies.
[01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:20.650]  Spread the word.
[01:52:20.710 --> 01:52:21.570]  Wake America up.
[01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:22.810]  Save the Republic.
[01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:22.870]  1-888-
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:32.265]  888-253-3139 That's 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net Again, 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net Police State 3 Total Enslavement now out.
[01:52:54.249 --> 01:52:57.912]  How many of you listening would give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[01:52:58.433 --> 01:52:59.274]  Listen up, folks.
[01:52:59.394 --> 01:53:02.797]  If you're taking vitamins in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[01:53:03.177 --> 01:53:11.885]  You see, according to the physician's... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.537 --> 01:53:20.178]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.858 --> 01:53:21.919]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.619 --> 01:53:23.820]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:25.201]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.961 --> 01:53:26.842]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.862 --> 01:53:31.205]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.705 --> 01:53:35.808]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.529 --> 01:53:42.812]  The globalist mind controllers say that perception is reality.
[01:53:44.173 --> 01:53:48.116]  They create the perception that the military and the police on our streets is good.
[01:53:49.244 --> 01:53:52.327]  When if you investigate, you'll find out it's bad.
[01:53:53.588 --> 01:53:59.033]  And that the militarization and the attack on freedom isn't just for the minority neighborhoods.
[01:53:59.634 --> 01:54:02.877]  It's for your neighborhood, too, as Tony Brown says.
[01:54:03.397 --> 01:54:04.518]  It's for everybody.
[01:54:04.599 --> 01:54:07.001]  And the more tyranny we get, the more...
[01:54:07.814 --> 01:54:10.556]  Liberty we lose, the more terror we see.
[01:54:10.876 --> 01:54:12.717]  You don't give up liberty and get security.
[01:54:12.737 --> 01:54:14.178]  You give up liberty and get tyranny.
[01:54:14.538 --> 01:54:20.002]  Despotism, delivering your children into a living Hades-like world.
[01:54:20.022 --> 01:54:23.584]  Now, we're going to take a lot of calls this hour.
[01:54:23.604 --> 01:54:26.786]  And the toll-free number to join me on air is 1-800-599-231.
[01:54:26.806 --> 01:54:28.567]  Coming up, Neocons dance to a Strauss waltz.
[01:54:28.587 --> 01:54:29.868]  Wait till you hear about...
[01:54:35.663 --> 01:54:39.106]  The leader they follow, who admits that he doesn't like free countries.
[01:54:39.607 --> 01:54:41.929]  David Bloom's death tied to smallpox shot.
[01:54:42.369 --> 01:54:44.151]  Who fears over toxic vaccine.
[01:54:45.111 --> 01:54:48.014]  Also controversial California gun decision stands.
[01:54:48.034 --> 01:54:51.697]  They're going to have the CIA running domestic anti-gun operations.
[01:54:52.138 --> 01:54:53.118]  Oh yeah, that's coming up.
[01:54:53.599 --> 01:54:54.520]  All part of the free country.
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:55:00.505]  We'll also get into how our loving government is installing the Ba'ath regime, the Saddam regime.
[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:02.960]  Back into control.
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:12.122]  Around the country, they're pulling down Davy Crockett statues and George Washington statues, and now the Minuteman faces a PC onslaught at Amherst University.
[01:55:12.682 --> 01:55:23.324]  Having stood bravely to the British more than 200 years ago, the Minuteman is finding he may have to march for the 21st century political correctness and marketing savvy of the University of Massachusetts.
[01:55:23.364 --> 01:55:24.164]  It's disappearing.
[01:55:24.885 --> 01:55:26.825]  Even conservative towns are getting rid of Davy Crockett.
[01:55:27.609 --> 01:55:28.349]  That's coming up.
[01:55:28.869 --> 01:55:30.330]  And children are being arrested.
[01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:32.610]  Another article about being arrested for playing dodgeball.
[01:55:32.991 --> 01:55:34.191]  They say it's a hateful move.
[01:55:34.631 --> 01:55:36.531]  Senate votes to expand NATO.
[01:55:36.551 --> 01:55:39.772]  Halliburton subsidiary gets new jobs in Iraq.
[01:55:40.333 --> 01:55:41.653]  And again, no bidding allowed.
[01:55:41.673 --> 01:55:43.433]  Because $7 billion isn't enough.
[01:55:44.514 --> 01:55:45.014]  New U.S.
[01:55:45.054 --> 01:55:45.994]  concerns in Iran.
[01:55:46.094 --> 01:55:47.554]  Pursuit on nuclear arms.
[01:55:47.654 --> 01:55:49.175]  Need to go ahead and attack them, they say.
[01:55:49.915 --> 01:55:51.015]  Rumsfeld, it's official.
[01:55:51.035 --> 01:55:52.596]  They plan to go into North Korea.
[01:55:53.156 --> 01:55:53.456]  U.S.
[01:55:53.596 --> 01:55:54.316]  urge U.N.
[01:55:54.336 --> 01:55:56.757]  to lift Iraq's sanctions now that it's fully owned by the bankers.
[01:55:57.646 --> 01:55:57.966]  U.S.
[01:55:57.986 --> 01:56:00.348]  spy photos show smoke coming out of a North Korean reactor.
[01:56:00.368 --> 01:56:02.068]  Again, lots of disinformation there.
[01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:05.891]  What we'll consider privacy interest in Vince Foster's suicide.
[01:56:05.931 --> 01:56:07.371]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:56:07.391 --> 01:56:09.873]  Oh, it's the privacy of the family.
[01:56:09.913 --> 01:56:14.055]  We won't release the real photos of him and the hit that was pulled on him.
[01:56:14.775 --> 01:56:17.797]  Also, hardliners make Iran risk fate of dictator.
[01:56:18.857 --> 01:56:22.219]  And the FBI forces increase on Hamas and Hezbollah.
[01:56:22.239 --> 01:56:23.480]  You mean CIA organizations?
[01:56:24.148 --> 01:56:27.210]  And trouble in Bush's America, what's happened with the economy.
[01:56:27.730 --> 01:56:30.112]  Pentagon weighs increased presence in Africa.
[01:56:30.572 --> 01:56:33.294]  Suicide law argued today in Oregon.
[01:56:33.854 --> 01:56:36.195]  Envoy dubs you as a police state from Germany.
[01:56:36.816 --> 01:56:40.318]  They're going to ban any type of criticism of the government or the U.S.
[01:56:40.378 --> 01:56:41.658]  government in Spain.
[01:56:41.678 --> 01:56:43.900]  And they're talking about laws here.
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:46.902]  They're warming you up that you're not allowed to criticize.
[01:56:47.822 --> 01:56:50.664]  And they're at a national TV show where people said kill the...
[01:56:51.818 --> 01:56:55.862]  Bixie Chicks, because they said they were against the war, was actually aired on NBC.
[01:56:57.183 --> 01:56:59.045]  Citizens calling for their heads.
[01:56:59.606 --> 01:57:01.047]  How dare them, Speaker!
[01:57:01.067 --> 01:57:02.488]  That's not America!
[01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:07.894]  So all of this craziness coming up in the next 55, 56 minutes, and we'll talk to John...
[01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:15.554]  In Missouri and others that are patiently holding.
[01:57:15.594 --> 01:57:17.295]  So everybody, stay with us.
[01:57:17.315 --> 01:57:17.976]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:17.996 --> 01:57:18.096]  800-259-9231.
[01:57:18.116 --> 01:57:19.517]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:57:19.537 --> 01:57:24.142]  And I really do want to thank everybody for joining us and all our wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[01:57:33.513 --> 01:57:46.299]  Shortwave affiliate as well, where we go out 11 to 2 Central on 12.172 and 93.20 from 11 to 2 Central every weekday and 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[01:57:46.339 --> 01:57:51.281]  And yes, I'm fired up about freedom.
[01:57:52.081 --> 01:57:59.865]  More conservative cities, not just liberal cities, are now passing pro-liberty, anti-patriot act legislation and laws.
[01:58:00.803 --> 01:58:10.405]  So there is an awakening taking place, but all of that can be erased when the globalists launch the next terror attack that they've assured you will take place.
[01:58:11.106 --> 01:58:12.146]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:12.506 --> 01:58:13.086]  Stay with us.
[01:58:15.046 --> 01:58:21.188]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:58:21.923 --> 01:58:29.426]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[01:58:29.646 --> 01:58:36.909]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:58:37.169 --> 01:58:41.351]  Potassium iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[01:58:41.531 --> 01:58:42.091]  We're good to go.
[01:59:05.185 --> 01:59:07.988]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:59:18.584 --> 01:59:19.865]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:59:20.085 --> 01:59:25.827]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:59:26.087 --> 01:59:31.348]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:59:31.649 --> 01:59:35.750]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:59:35.970 --> 01:59:39.735]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:59:40.015 --> 01:59:44.661]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:59:44.741 --> 01:59:51.009]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:59:51.049 --> 01:59:52.872]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:59:53.332 --> 01:59:55.435]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyrion today.

[02:00:09.391 --> 02:00:10.913]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:00:11.093 --> 02:00:13.136]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:00:15.296 --> 02:00:19.778]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:00:20.138 --> 02:00:24.240]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:25.060]  We listened.
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:30.362]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:00:30.642 --> 02:00:31.123]  We listened.
[02:00:31.503 --> 02:00:34.544]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:00:34.964 --> 02:00:35.504]  We listened.
[02:00:35.965 --> 02:00:39.126]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:00:39.366 --> 02:00:39.926]  We're good to go.
[02:01:05.879 --> 02:01:10.103]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:01:10.343 --> 02:01:13.025]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:01:14.847 --> 02:01:19.891]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:20.251 --> 02:01:22.593]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:24.575 --> 02:01:27.978]  People don't take things seriously enough.
[02:01:28.518 --> 02:01:30.400]  They don't realize how
[02:01:31.836 --> 02:01:38.922]  Real the world is and that liberties have been fought hard to establish precedence.
[02:01:40.063 --> 02:01:47.108]  And I just want to thank all of our veterans, the real veterans in all our wars that truly fought to defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:58.798]  And I'm sad for our troops that are being used for the New World Order and are being injected with deadly vaccines who are being brought back here and turned into militarized police.
[02:02:00.791 --> 02:02:02.531]  We need to remember what America is about.
[02:02:02.631 --> 02:02:05.512]  What makes America America is because it was a free country.
[02:02:06.072 --> 02:02:07.352]  Now we're beginning to lose that.
[02:02:07.852 --> 02:02:09.573]  We're seeing the shift rapidly.
[02:02:10.253 --> 02:02:17.574]  And patriots everywhere need to be veterans in the second American revolution, or I should say restoration.
[02:02:17.854 --> 02:02:22.015]  For all the veterans that really gave all, we've had requests for this song.
[02:02:22.195 --> 02:02:29.976]  We'll air it, then I'll come back and talk to John in Indiana, or John in Missouri, and others that are patiently holding, and I'll launch into a bunch of geopolitical
[02:02:30.692 --> 02:02:32.093]  News and information.
[02:02:33.154 --> 02:02:34.134]  So again, stay with us.
[02:02:34.195 --> 02:02:35.756]  I think this song says it all.
[02:02:35.816 --> 02:02:37.257]  It's not sappy.
[02:02:37.617 --> 02:02:39.538]  A lot of people died to defend liberty.
[02:02:39.959 --> 02:02:44.742]  That's what that flag symbolizes, is our republic, not a unit of a world empire.
[02:02:46.883 --> 02:02:58.712]  I knew a man called him Sandy King You folks even knew his name But a hero, yes, was he
[02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:30.049]  Left a boy, came back a man Still many just don't understand About the reasons we are free I can't forget the look in his eyes Or the tears he cried As he said these words to me
[02:03:36.676 --> 02:04:01.838]  All gave some Some gave all Some stood through for the red, white and blue And some had to fall And if you ever think of me Think of all your liberties and recall
[02:04:09.089 --> 02:04:13.753]  We're good to go.
[02:04:41.658 --> 02:05:09.258]  For all his friends who gave us all Who stood the ground and took the ball To help their fellow man I love your country and live with pride And don't forget those who died America, can't you see
[02:05:17.825 --> 02:05:42.777]  All gave some And some gave all And some stood through For the red, white, and blue And some had to fall And if you ever think of me Think of all your liberties and recall
[02:05:49.591 --> 02:06:18.914]  Some gave all And if you ever think of me Think of all your liberties And recall Yes, recall Some gave all Some gave all
[02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:24.330]  I remember.
[02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:35.398]  I remember five, six, seven, eight, nine years ago, we would have American flags on our cars, American flags at our rallies, people drive by.
[02:06:35.418 --> 02:06:36.419]  Look at those kooks.
[02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:41.342]  Look at those people speaking out against the U.N., talking about national sovereignty.
[02:06:41.362 --> 02:06:42.983]  Look at those gun nuts.
[02:06:44.144 --> 02:06:45.966]  Then we'd see the law enforcement manuals.
[02:06:46.106 --> 02:06:49.208]  Watch out if somebody's got American flags on their car.
[02:06:51.010 --> 02:07:02.056]  I remember seeing inside the LAPD on the Discovery Channel about three years ago, one of the times I got the maddest, a veteran, World War II veteran, had died.
[02:07:02.076 --> 02:07:07.759]  And he was a, we later found out, was a widower.
[02:07:08.419 --> 02:07:10.160]  In his house, he had died.
[02:07:10.180 --> 02:07:12.982]  His body had been dead for five, six days.
[02:07:13.062 --> 02:07:13.882]  His body stunk.
[02:07:14.042 --> 02:07:14.622]  It was bloated.
[02:07:14.642 --> 02:07:17.224]  The police pulled up with a SWAT team.
[02:07:17.264 --> 02:07:19.405]  The neighbor said that there was a smell and he hadn't been out.
[02:07:20.484 --> 02:07:28.326]  He had an NRA sticker on his car, an American flag, and his sticker, you know, a Pacific veteran of World War II.
[02:07:28.386 --> 02:07:32.948]  And these young, dirty, evil thugs laughed at him and said, look at this NRA sticker.
[02:07:33.468 --> 02:07:36.029]  This is one of these dangerous kooks, one of these survivalists.
[02:07:36.389 --> 02:07:37.209]  They go in his house.
[02:07:37.269 --> 02:07:38.450]  They pick up all his guns.
[02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:39.430]  They start laughing at him.
[02:07:40.111 --> 02:07:44.818]  They laugh at his dead body and go, Man, this guy stinks, and his views stink.
[02:07:45.339 --> 02:07:47.682]  And they start talking about what a dirty piece of garbage he is.
[02:07:47.702 --> 02:07:48.644]  They even use those words.
[02:07:49.004 --> 02:07:52.109]  Pick up his guns and start fighting over them, going, This one's mine.
[02:07:52.510 --> 02:07:53.451]  I'm keeping this one.
[02:07:53.812 --> 02:07:54.993]  I had to watch police.
[02:07:55.033 --> 02:07:55.995]  And they do this on purpose.
[02:07:56.863 --> 02:07:58.144]  We're good to go.
[02:08:21.423 --> 02:08:34.848]  This case in Eugene, Oregon, where the National Guard's driving the tank and they drag the naked blonde out and got the black bag on her head in front of 56 cops laughing at her, right in three houses, running around foaming at the mouth.
[02:08:35.248 --> 02:08:37.569]  A school teacher comes out in the morning and says, can I leave?
[02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:38.429]  One of the other neighbors.
[02:08:38.869 --> 02:08:41.570]  Top says, I haven't killed anybody in two weeks.
[02:08:42.327 --> 02:08:43.007]  They wear shirts.
[02:08:43.067 --> 02:08:44.288]  Somebody's going to die.
[02:08:44.308 --> 02:08:45.749]  This is shameful.
[02:08:45.809 --> 02:08:47.910]  This isn't what our veterans fought and died for.
[02:08:48.230 --> 02:08:49.171]  This is shameful.
[02:08:49.211 --> 02:08:50.772]  This is disgusting.
[02:08:51.212 --> 02:08:54.053]  The new patriotism is the kind of patriotism they had under Stalin.
[02:08:54.394 --> 02:08:55.474]  Worship the leader.
[02:08:55.854 --> 02:08:57.275]  Don't criticize the leader.
[02:08:57.675 --> 02:08:58.776]  Worship the government.
[02:08:59.156 --> 02:09:01.678]  Well, in America, America isn't the government.
[02:09:01.719 --> 02:09:16.392]  America's the Bill of Rights and the veterans that fought and died for it and the little old ladies that wrote letters to defend it and the people that went and stood up to the environmental land grabbers at their city councils and the people that fought to keep their kids away from the government's drugs and corruption.
[02:09:18.273 --> 02:09:25.380]  You've got scientifically crafted bureaus thinking of how to dumb you down, how to turn you into an idiot, how to get you into the system.
[02:09:26.986 --> 02:09:28.668]  And I'm not going to sit here and put up with it.
[02:09:29.208 --> 02:09:48.449]  I'm going to stand up like the veterans before me and defend this republic in the spirit of 1776 against the enemy combatants, against the usurpers, against the dark cult of evil that Bush has called it, and the evildoers, the ones that are running this entire government, Republicans and Democrats, selling you out for 20 pieces of silver.
[02:09:51.084 --> 02:09:53.966]  We have got a right, a duty to stand against this evil.
[02:09:54.547 --> 02:09:59.110]  And we've got to stop giving in to the corruption that is just spiraling out of control.
[02:10:00.991 --> 02:10:10.498]  So, if you ever think of the veterans, you think of what that flag symbolizes and stop mindlessly flapping it on your car when the government tells you to put it out there.
[02:10:12.679 --> 02:10:13.780]  It's incredible, folks.
[02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:17.042]  Let's talk to John in Missouri and then Joe in Oregon.
[02:10:17.062 --> 02:10:17.723]  Go ahead, John.
[02:10:18.406 --> 02:10:32.757]  Alex, first off, I just want to say it is sick, all the American flags on everybody's cars, because a lot of us have been patriotic our whole lives, and it takes a PS event like 9-11 for everybody else to go patriotic all of a sudden.
[02:10:33.238 --> 02:10:36.180]  Let me just jump in, and I'll let you finish, John.
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:38.201]  And please be careful with the language.
[02:10:38.502 --> 02:10:39.302]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:39.943 --> 02:10:41.084]  I understand this makes you mad.
[02:10:41.124 --> 02:10:41.744]  It makes me mad, too.
[02:10:41.764 --> 02:10:42.585]  We've got to be better than them.
[02:10:42.985 --> 02:10:43.966]  The thing here is...
[02:10:46.812 --> 02:10:52.497]  They're all telling us to fly them now, but it means that you, quote, support the destruction of what that flag symbolizes.
[02:10:52.537 --> 02:10:52.917]  Go ahead.
[02:10:53.298 --> 02:10:53.958]  Oh, yes, sir.
[02:10:54.158 --> 02:10:59.603]  The small size ones you put on cars, I started to buy one, but I can't find one made in America.
[02:11:00.984 --> 02:11:08.410]  You can't fill your shopping cart up with 5% of goods if you go shopping one week, you know, non-grocery shopping with American products.
[02:11:09.871 --> 02:11:13.174]  I just wanted to tell you that my mother got our sidearm back from St.
[02:11:13.214 --> 02:11:14.595]  Louis County Police Department.
[02:11:15.069 --> 02:11:28.300]  Who took it away from me in a Motel 6, and I'm still battling with Motel 6 on the phone, and who later made me and my pregnant fiance leave, the police stood right there in front of me and my friends and said they were going to take it.
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:34.325]  I had a rock and roll t-shirt on and my hat on, and I guess I was wearing that uniform you talk about.
[02:11:34.824 --> 02:11:37.147]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:11:37.348 --> 02:11:39.691]  MTV says it's cool to dress like this.
[02:11:40.071 --> 02:11:43.256]  The cops are then trained, that's an enemy uniform, and you're playing their game.
[02:11:43.717 --> 02:11:51.828]  They admitted that they had no legal right to take it other than I was under emotional distress because they'd had me handcuffed for no reason for 20 minutes.
[02:11:52.406 --> 02:11:53.026]  Alex, my battery's going off.
[02:11:53.046 --> 02:11:57.027]  For those that don't know, you're in the motel, you got your gun in a state that still has some Second Amendment.
[02:11:57.447 --> 02:11:59.307]  They come in, the maid sees it.
[02:11:59.467 --> 02:12:00.228]  Is that what happened?
[02:12:00.768 --> 02:12:01.248]  No, sir.
[02:12:01.688 --> 02:12:04.408]  Some people were drinking across the parking lot, some minors.
[02:12:04.729 --> 02:12:06.789]  And I'm not a minor, and I wasn't even drinking.
[02:12:07.229 --> 02:12:08.849]  And so they went around everybody's room.
[02:12:08.869 --> 02:12:10.170]  It was just younger folks, I suppose.
[02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:11.650]  Oh, just a massive search.
[02:12:11.710 --> 02:12:13.730]  Yeah, it was a big ramp.
[02:12:14.210 --> 02:12:14.931]  It was ridiculous.
[02:12:14.971 --> 02:12:17.191]  But my phone's getting ready to go to Alex.
[02:12:17.271 --> 02:12:18.851]  I hear your cordless cut now.
[02:12:18.891 --> 02:12:19.472]  Thanks for the call.
[02:12:19.492 --> 02:12:21.552]  We'll come back and talk to Joe, Dave, Phillip, and others.
[02:12:22.794 --> 02:12:23.434]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:12:23.755 --> 02:12:30.058]  And whenever I interrupt, because I've got to make a key point that won't be made if I don't do it, and I appreciate the call, John, in Missouri.
[02:12:30.999 --> 02:12:32.480]  Yeah, it's just out of control.
[02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:35.462]  Our veterans fought and died so we'd have that Second Amendment.
[02:12:36.062 --> 02:12:37.823]  They just stood up for our God-given right.
[02:12:38.243 --> 02:12:42.626]  And we're losing it right now, thanks to Lord Daschle and Lord Bush and the rest of them.
[02:12:43.246 --> 02:12:45.228]  We'll break and come back and get to more calls and more news.
[02:12:45.268 --> 02:12:45.668]  Stay with me.
[02:12:45.708 --> 02:12:46.508]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:12:48.049 --> 02:12:48.790]  It's unbelievable.
[02:12:49.777 --> 02:12:50.437]  Unbelievable.
[02:12:50.557 --> 02:12:55.599]  Our veterans didn't fight and die so men in black ski masks can drag your naked wife out with a bag over her head.
[02:12:55.879 --> 02:12:56.759]  No drugs were found.
[02:12:57.019 --> 02:13:00.320]  They go ahead and charge you for having some potting soil in your garden.
[02:13:00.820 --> 02:13:04.801]  No drugs found, but we're going to arrest you because you have, quote, paraphernalia.
[02:13:05.801 --> 02:13:08.422]  It's like they arrested Abby Newman for having a pocket Constitution.
[02:13:09.082 --> 02:13:10.822]  The cops said, is this still legal?
[02:13:11.482 --> 02:13:13.543]  They don't think a Constitution's legal, folks.
[02:13:15.462 --> 02:13:24.087]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:13:24.307 --> 02:13:35.574]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:13:35.794 --> 02:13:38.455]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:13:38.796 --> 02:13:42.898]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:13:43.098 --> 02:13:45.241]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:13:45.401 --> 02:13:47.283]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:13:47.484 --> 02:13:53.511]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:13:53.751 --> 02:13:59.218]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:13:59.738 --> 02:14:03.662]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:14:04.402 --> 02:14:05.403]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:14:15.399 --> 02:14:15.800]  We're good to go.
[02:14:30.299 --> 02:14:30.539]  The book,
[02:14:57.523 --> 02:15:02.185]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[02:15:02.405 --> 02:15:06.326]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.

[02:15:15.849 --> 02:15:20.734]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a roadmap, and how easy it would be to get lost?
[02:15:21.054 --> 02:15:22.436]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[02:15:22.456 --> 02:15:24.778]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[02:15:25.218 --> 02:15:28.061]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[02:15:28.121 --> 02:15:28.461]  coins.
[02:15:28.721 --> 02:15:29.963]  The Red Book Guide to U.S.
[02:15:30.003 --> 02:15:35.568]  Coins and History provides you with the knowledge you'll need to make informed decisions when it comes to collecting and investing in U.S.
[02:15:35.588 --> 02:15:36.549]  gold and silver coins.
[02:15:36.829 --> 02:15:38.831]  The year 2003 edition of the Red Book
[02:15:38.831 --> 02:15:39.491]  1-800-686-2237 That's 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237
[02:16:04.824 --> 02:16:07.886]  Coin values are always changing and so is the Red Book Guide to U.S.

[02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:09.207]  1-800-622-THIN.
[02:17:09.227 --> 02:17:10.588]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:17:10.608 --> 02:17:11.948]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:28.576 --> 02:17:30.777]  You're not upset about what's happening in this country.
[02:17:30.817 --> 02:17:31.837]  There's something wrong with you.
[02:17:32.037 --> 02:17:33.657]  Alex Jones here back live, folks.
[02:17:33.737 --> 02:17:35.478]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Oregon.
[02:17:36.458 --> 02:17:37.338]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:17:37.378 --> 02:17:37.958]  Welcome, sir.
[02:17:38.338 --> 02:17:39.278]  Yeah, thanks.
[02:17:39.338 --> 02:17:40.799]  Thanks for your work.
[02:17:41.779 --> 02:17:55.662]  All I can say is that I'm glad that you've been able to do what you do and at least pay the bills, because what you're doing is you've got probably, and I am a reader, and I don't have television at all for four years now, and I've always been a reader.
[02:17:56.351 --> 02:18:04.573]  And all I can say is that the job that you do, you're probably the most important person in media now in North America, in my opinion.
[02:18:04.613 --> 02:18:06.573]  And I'm not glad-handing you.
[02:18:06.834 --> 02:18:07.294]  I mean that.
[02:18:07.314 --> 02:18:08.314]  That's how I feel.
[02:18:09.034 --> 02:18:13.455]  Also, the previous caller, this is only an example.
[02:18:13.715 --> 02:18:15.196]  On and on and on, what's going on.
[02:18:15.216 --> 02:18:17.456]  Then you spoke about what happened up in Eugene.
[02:18:18.196 --> 02:18:25.438]  We just recently had a shooting in Portland of a young woman, totally unjustified.
[02:18:25.856 --> 02:18:30.119]  The thing is, the people that are upset in the country now are not left-wing.
[02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:43.430]  There's a lot of conservative, hard-working people that are taxpayers that really, really know that something is wrong, and especially since 9-11 we know something's wrong.
[02:18:43.871 --> 02:18:55.500]  And the other thing is, Alex, the people that are doing training of our police, I just want to say this and I'll go, but when we have
[02:18:56.112 --> 02:19:06.339]  The police officers and police departments around the country that are being told not to read certain websites, not to listen to Patriots.
[02:19:06.919 --> 02:19:20.809]  And in Canada, the RCMP, I know this for a fact, the RCMP is told that they cannot go alone and talk to any of these, like the Canadian Heritage Front, they have to be with another officer.
[02:19:21.069 --> 02:19:23.751]  They're so worried about contamination from rational...
[02:19:24.315 --> 02:19:26.076]  Educated people speaking to them.
[02:19:26.216 --> 02:19:30.878]  Well, yeah, I mean, I want to ask police, and this isn't just Missouri or Arizona or Texas or New York.
[02:19:31.278 --> 02:19:40.162]  We have the training manuals nationwide where they say the Constitution is bad, the Founding Fathers are bad, Christians are bad, guns are bad.
[02:19:40.202 --> 02:19:40.922]  I mean, you've seen it.
[02:19:40.942 --> 02:19:41.702]  It's been in the news.
[02:19:42.183 --> 02:19:46.945]  How do they tell a cop that the Constitution is illegal when they swear an oath to it?
[02:19:47.925 --> 02:19:52.447]  Yeah, but let me say this, and I'll go, is that...
[02:19:53.396 --> 02:19:59.826]  What we have is that the people that are doing the training also have an office in the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.
[02:20:00.563 --> 02:20:04.447]  We have private organizations that have faced lawsuits and lost.
[02:20:04.547 --> 02:20:05.808]  That's the ADL.
[02:20:06.028 --> 02:20:09.031]  The ADL are the ones that teach the manuals, yeah.
[02:20:09.052 --> 02:20:22.125]  We're talking about the SPLC and the ADL, and when you talk about the Constitution in Berkeley, California right now, you have a Thomas Jefferson Elementary School where they want to remove Thomas Jefferson's name.
[02:20:22.405 --> 02:20:23.486]  They are demonizing...
[02:20:23.939 --> 02:20:29.549]  For years now, the founding fathers of this country, and they're not teaching anything in school.
[02:20:31.656 --> 02:20:35.238]  Well, yeah, the left wing does it, and the right wing does nothing to stop it because they're all on the same team.
[02:20:35.978 --> 02:20:40.861]  And did you hear about how they're going to make them get rid of the states that have the Minuteman symbol?
[02:20:40.881 --> 02:20:42.162]  They're taking it down all over the place.
[02:20:42.222 --> 02:20:44.483]  Davy Crockett is being taken down.
[02:20:44.603 --> 02:20:45.063]  All this.
[02:20:45.463 --> 02:20:46.084]  Well, yeah.
[02:20:46.224 --> 02:20:52.747]  Well, the thing is, this is it, and I'll go, is that they are deconstructing Western civilization.
[02:20:53.067 --> 02:20:55.148]  No one's heard of Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
[02:20:55.609 --> 02:20:59.971]  There's a war on against civilization and what...
[02:21:00.976 --> 02:21:01.316]  Period.
[02:21:01.356 --> 02:21:02.156]  That's what's happening, folks.
[02:21:02.176 --> 02:21:06.458]  And when Bush says the terrorist attack does because they hate our freedom, that is true.
[02:21:06.798 --> 02:21:16.662]  The globalists that carried 9-1-1 out are doing this to destroy our freedoms, to destroy our liberties, and when they say that it's a war against civilization, it's true.
[02:21:17.202 --> 02:21:27.526]  They're overreacting because they know we're waking up in great numbers and we're saying no, and the police, most police, not all, but most of them need to get their head out of there.
[02:21:27.546 --> 02:21:28.166]  You know what?
[02:21:28.466 --> 02:21:29.607]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:21:31.255 --> 02:21:31.735]  They do.
[02:21:31.835 --> 02:21:33.156]  I mean, folks, I got it on video.
[02:21:33.236 --> 02:21:41.758]  I got FEMA telling a class of police that, quote, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson are terrorists, Christians are enemies of the federal government, period.
[02:21:41.778 --> 02:21:44.179]  I've got their training manuals.
[02:21:44.519 --> 02:21:45.779]  I've got it in the news articles.
[02:21:45.939 --> 02:21:47.380]  I've got them listing homeschoolers.
[02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:50.861]  And then a little kid, a little Taiwanese immigrant,
[02:21:51.676 --> 02:21:52.537]  We're good to go.
[02:22:21.849 --> 02:22:25.911]  They're literally teaching them 1984 Ingsoc.
[02:22:27.151 --> 02:22:29.633]  Mindless idiots is what we're being turned into.
[02:22:29.653 --> 02:22:32.034]  So, of course, the homeschoolers are winning everything.
[02:22:33.494 --> 02:22:40.637]  I mean, the valedictorian of the school today doesn't hold a candle to my father.
[02:22:40.677 --> 02:22:42.278]  I went to public school.
[02:22:42.318 --> 02:22:43.639]  I'm not half as smart as my dad is.
[02:22:43.659 --> 02:22:44.099]  You know why?
[02:22:44.179 --> 02:22:50.762]  Because my dad knew how to read and write and do everything by the time he was four because he had the old-line education from his grandmother.
[02:22:51.954 --> 02:22:53.735]  You've got to educate your kids yourself, folks.
[02:22:54.015 --> 02:22:56.997]  And why you put them in these camps, I have no idea.
[02:22:57.678 --> 02:23:00.340]  The public schools are brainwashing camps.
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:03.202]  We have the official documents, Department of Education.
[02:23:05.643 --> 02:23:06.604]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.044 --> 02:23:08.645]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.546 --> 02:23:12.268]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.589 --> 02:23:18.592]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:23:18.912 --> 02:23:23.836]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:23:24.096 --> 02:23:30.341]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they are... 803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:23:30.581 --> 02:23:33.564]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:23:33.824 --> 02:23:34.665]  Protect your family.
[02:23:37.387 --> 02:23:42.431]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:43.189 --> 02:23:45.549]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:23:45.569 --> 02:23:52.331]  I'm going to take a few more calls from Dave, Phillip, Tom, Rob, and others.
[02:23:53.871 --> 02:23:56.391]  Then I'm going to cover news for the final 15 minutes or so.
[02:23:56.411 --> 02:23:57.872]  A lot of really important stuff.
[02:23:57.892 --> 02:24:00.332]  Let's talk to Dave in Maine.
[02:24:00.412 --> 02:24:01.232]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:24:01.272 --> 02:24:01.592]  Welcome.
[02:24:01.612 --> 02:24:01.993]  Go ahead.
[02:24:02.413 --> 02:24:03.453]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:24:03.513 --> 02:24:08.434]  I wanted to touch on a couple of topics that you briefly hit over the past couple of days.
[02:24:08.494 --> 02:24:09.914]  The first one is two days ago.
[02:24:10.755 --> 02:24:11.035]  Thank you.
[02:24:11.055 --> 02:24:11.355]  Thank you.
[02:24:38.075 --> 02:24:39.356]  And the tender is refused.
[02:24:39.537 --> 02:24:45.203]  There is discharge to the extent of the amount of the tender of the obligation of an endorser, etc., etc.
[02:24:45.223 --> 02:24:50.428]  I think under the contract they have you signed with a credit card, they can probably do that.
[02:24:50.748 --> 02:24:52.851]  But if you already signed a contract before...
[02:24:53.777 --> 02:24:54.157]  Absolutely.
[02:24:54.297 --> 02:24:56.959]  Now, the second thing I wanted to touch on real quick was
[02:25:11.131 --> 02:25:19.881]  Yesterday you had a caller who called in just before your guest, and he was briefly hit on the deflation of our currency.
[02:25:19.941 --> 02:25:21.983]  And the dollar plunged just two days ago.
[02:25:22.103 --> 02:25:22.283]  Right.
[02:25:22.323 --> 02:25:24.766]  Now, deflation doesn't refer to the dollar plunging.
[02:25:24.806 --> 02:25:29.190]  Deflation refers to the dollar increasing in value, and I wanted to explain that real quick.
[02:25:29.671 --> 02:25:33.415]  We all understand that all money is created by private bank loans.
[02:25:34.053 --> 02:25:39.694]  At the time of the loan, in the form of a created deposit and deposited into a transaction account.
[02:25:39.714 --> 02:25:41.275]  They have to inflate the cover-up.
[02:25:41.315 --> 02:25:41.515]  Right.
[02:25:41.835 --> 02:25:50.357]  So as money is borrowed into existence by consumers, businesses, governments, etc., you have an increase in the money supply.
[02:25:50.697 --> 02:25:54.218]  So as the money supply increases, the more there is, the less it's worth.
[02:25:54.738 --> 02:25:58.279]  Now, over the past couple, three or four years, what has been happening is
[02:25:58.857 --> 02:25:59.617]  Yeah, you had a restriction.
[02:26:25.592 --> 02:26:28.575]  Of the money supply so you couldn't physically pay a debt off.
[02:26:28.735 --> 02:26:30.056]  Right, so that's what's happening now.
[02:26:30.436 --> 02:26:40.685]  And with this concept of fractional reserve banking, we're in a lot of trouble because when the bank creates the money at the time of the loan, they only create the principal.
[02:26:40.745 --> 02:26:50.633]  Now, you're going to owe the interest back as well as the principal, and the only way you can get interest money to pay that interest back is somebody else has to borrow new money into existence.
[02:26:50.993 --> 02:26:52.855]  Well, if everybody pays off their loans...
[02:26:53.188 --> 02:27:03.951]  There's not enough money physically in circulation in the form of paper or in credit entries, debit entries, and they call it digital money.
[02:27:04.211 --> 02:27:08.552]  There's just not enough of it to cover everything because it only represents the principle.
[02:27:08.612 --> 02:27:10.373]  The interest is what is going to kill us.
[02:27:10.933 --> 02:27:21.876]  And as people continue to pay off their loans, the first ones to pay their loans off of the whole society, let's think the whole country, as everybody pays their loans off, the first ones will get in
[02:27:22.406 --> 02:27:22.726]  I think so.
[02:27:39.056 --> 02:27:48.738]  And to make it even worse, they're coming out with a new colored money to start calling in the old greenbacks, so that will neutralize the old funders who have got the money hidden in the wall or in the mattress.
[02:27:48.818 --> 02:27:50.719]  Right, I have a theory on that colored money.
[02:27:50.739 --> 02:27:53.520]  The Federal Reserve has said what they're going to do with it.
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:58.201]  It's got a strip in it like the larger face greens that came out six years ago.
[02:27:58.221 --> 02:28:06.643]  Right, now, what's going to happen with that colored money is everybody is so used to seeing green, they're going to have a hard time accepting it, which is understandable because...
[02:28:07.376 --> 02:28:08.377]  My sister works at a bookstore.
[02:28:08.397 --> 02:28:15.123]  Well, it's also to limit the money supply to a further extent so they can destroy old greenbacks hidden in circulation and globally.
[02:28:15.603 --> 02:28:22.449]  And, yes, it will make people... It prepares them for the change, if I was upset, so you're right, to get into the cashless society.
[02:28:22.769 --> 02:28:22.949]  Right.
[02:28:23.029 --> 02:28:24.871]  Now, there was a fellow at the store.
[02:28:24.891 --> 02:28:27.913]  They tried to give him change back in those $1 Sagatua dollar coins.
[02:28:30.154 --> 02:28:32.195]  And he refused the dollar coin exchange.
[02:28:32.215 --> 02:28:33.616]  He said, no, I want real money.
[02:28:34.096 --> 02:28:35.457]  I want the Federal Reserve note.
[02:28:35.477 --> 02:28:36.497]  I want the green stuff.
[02:28:36.557 --> 02:28:37.257]  That's real money.
[02:28:37.357 --> 02:28:41.359]  So the people like him... He didn't want a coin that was worth, what, eight bucks for a dollar.
[02:28:41.599 --> 02:28:42.660]  He wanted to be ripped off.
[02:28:42.700 --> 02:28:43.460]  He wanted paper.
[02:28:43.900 --> 02:28:44.080]  Right.
[02:28:44.361 --> 02:28:53.325]  So these are the type of people who, when the colored money comes out, are just not going to accept it, and they'll go to using their bank cards or their checks or their credit cards or whatever, which...
[02:28:54.375 --> 02:28:56.295]  We're going to do this to ourselves, Alex.
[02:28:57.156 --> 02:29:06.517]  All the government and all the Federal Reserve has to do is put a couple of things in motion, and we are going to send ourselves into the speed system.
[02:29:06.777 --> 02:29:07.377]  Let me say something.
[02:29:07.417 --> 02:29:08.658]  They're masters of that.
[02:29:09.258 --> 02:29:11.998]  That's why they're putting in the thumb scanners, the buy and sell.
[02:29:12.298 --> 02:29:14.459]  The kids are already thumb scanning to get their school lunches.
[02:29:14.499 --> 02:29:15.419]  No cash allowed.
[02:29:15.819 --> 02:29:17.319]  Training them for the biometric system.
[02:29:17.359 --> 02:29:18.379]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:29:18.739 --> 02:29:21.560]  And the more we accept it, the deeper in the hole we go.
[02:29:23.012 --> 02:29:25.233]  So that's what I wanted to put in my two cents.
[02:29:25.253 --> 02:29:26.633]  And some will say, well, that's a good point.
[02:29:26.653 --> 02:29:27.054]  Thanks, Dave.
[02:29:27.434 --> 02:29:29.134]  Some will say, well, the government doesn't want to do that.
[02:29:29.154 --> 02:29:30.695]  They want us to make money and be happy.
[02:29:31.155 --> 02:29:32.296]  No, they don't, folks.
[02:29:33.396 --> 02:29:34.496]  They want to consolidate.
[02:29:34.516 --> 02:29:35.957]  They want to get you under their control.
[02:29:37.324 --> 02:29:42.007]  They want to de-industrialize us so bad, the economy will totally implode when they're ready.
[02:29:42.428 --> 02:29:46.971]  They'll provide another terrorist attack to get you to rally around the government while it's happening so you won't blame them.
[02:29:47.591 --> 02:29:50.153]  Then there'll be federal retraining, troops in the factories.
[02:29:50.473 --> 02:29:52.154]  This has all been announced by Governor Rich.
[02:29:53.055 --> 02:29:54.436]  Worse than 1984.
[02:29:55.056 --> 02:30:00.260]  Literal Soviet maximum union-type control with private companies.
[02:30:00.820 --> 02:30:03.363]  Robert Barron Banks owning everything.
[02:30:04.023 --> 02:30:07.947]  They're going to blow out the state economies, city and county economies, everything.
[02:30:09.328 --> 02:30:12.731]  And a lot of people are just going to grovel and beg the government during the whole process.
[02:30:12.751 --> 02:30:14.293]  They're going to love the slavery.
[02:30:14.673 --> 02:30:15.354]  Good points, Dave.
[02:30:15.374 --> 02:30:17.015]  I hope people understand what you were saying.
[02:30:17.376 --> 02:30:18.357]  Phillip in Virginia.
[02:30:18.417 --> 02:30:19.237]  Phillip, you're on the air.
[02:30:19.277 --> 02:30:19.658]  Go ahead.
[02:30:20.751 --> 02:30:21.471]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:30:22.032 --> 02:30:25.993]  You know, one of the things I like so much about this program is you don't have to listen to it.
[02:30:26.754 --> 02:30:30.475]  Who is that rush that says, listen to me for six weeks or something like that?
[02:30:30.795 --> 02:30:36.498]  I mean, you can turn on to this program every day and be brought up to speed on things.
[02:30:36.938 --> 02:30:44.701]  And I just like the way that you add the caveats to the different news stories, how you expose things.
[02:30:45.101 --> 02:30:45.882]  We're good to go.
[02:31:01.781 --> 02:31:12.004]  I'll tell you what, listening to that, what happened to the man and the woman today that they got searched by over 50 law enforcement officers and didn't find nothing.
[02:31:12.444 --> 02:31:21.707]  But they still arrested them for having potting soil and said that's now paraphernalia and drugged the man's good-looking wife out naked in front of all the neighbors.
[02:31:21.747 --> 02:31:25.308]  And then a schoolteacher hours into the raid said, I need to go to work.
[02:31:26.309 --> 02:31:27.529]  Can I pull out my car and leave?
[02:31:27.569 --> 02:31:30.650]  And he said, the cop said, I haven't killed anybody in two weeks.
[02:31:31.483 --> 02:31:32.884]  I mean, that's just mental illness.
[02:31:33.344 --> 02:31:34.745]  Yeah.
[02:31:34.825 --> 02:31:36.705]  Like you said, demon-possessed.
[02:31:36.966 --> 02:31:38.986]  But I had a couple of questions, but one other thing.
[02:31:39.327 --> 02:31:44.769]  People need to make sure they've got video cameras and stay together in groups.
[02:31:45.256 --> 02:31:46.417]  So you can have witnesses.
[02:31:46.817 --> 02:31:54.040]  Because if this kind of crap goes on, excuse me, this kind of stuff goes on around where I'm at, I'm going to be there investigating.
[02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:56.101]  I'm not going to let these people push me around.
[02:31:56.121 --> 02:31:57.101]  I don't care if they've got a badge.
[02:31:57.181 --> 02:31:59.622]  If they don't have a badge on, I'm going to demand where it's at.
[02:31:59.922 --> 02:32:01.243]  They've got a ski mask on.
[02:32:01.523 --> 02:32:02.283]  It's coming off.
[02:32:02.784 --> 02:32:03.224]  You hear me?
[02:32:03.804 --> 02:32:07.846]  And people, we need to get together because we can't let this keep going on.
[02:32:08.066 --> 02:32:08.546]  Absolutely.
[02:32:08.586 --> 02:32:09.747]  Good to hear from you.
[02:32:10.107 --> 02:32:11.287]  I appreciate the call, Phillip.
[02:32:11.307 --> 02:32:12.968]  And I understand your anger, your outrage.
[02:32:14.582 --> 02:32:19.463]  Police with no badges and black ski masks with the National Guard raiding neighborhoods.
[02:32:19.543 --> 02:32:21.323]  I see this all over the country now.
[02:32:21.924 --> 02:32:23.964]  Dragging your naked wife out by the hair.
[02:32:24.124 --> 02:32:24.964]  No drugs found.
[02:32:25.004 --> 02:32:25.984]  You have no criminal record.
[02:32:26.364 --> 02:32:27.205]  They go, that's it.
[02:32:27.285 --> 02:32:28.045]  We're charging you.
[02:32:28.065 --> 02:32:28.985]  We may take your house.
[02:32:29.245 --> 02:32:30.285]  You had potting soil.
[02:32:30.345 --> 02:32:31.486]  That's drug paraphernalia.
[02:32:31.906 --> 02:32:33.206]  They pull a housewife over.
[02:32:33.546 --> 02:32:34.606]  Pocket Constitution.
[02:32:34.866 --> 02:32:35.566]  They arrest her.
[02:32:35.746 --> 02:32:36.587]  We have it on tape.
[02:32:36.927 --> 02:32:38.347]  They discuss, is this legal?
[02:32:39.289 --> 02:32:45.214]  Folks, it is Twilight Zone, Body Snatcher, Matrix-level crazy, okay?
[02:32:46.074 --> 02:32:47.195]  You know, you've seen Body Snatcher.
[02:32:47.215 --> 02:32:49.517]  It's the old 50s version where the guy's running around on the highway.
[02:32:49.797 --> 02:32:51.058]  We're in danger!
[02:32:51.198 --> 02:32:51.959]  Wake up!
[02:32:52.639 --> 02:32:53.680]  Warn everyone!
[02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:54.641]  They're taking over!
[02:32:54.681 --> 02:33:02.367]  But it's our own species doing it to us, and everybody just keeps going along because the talking head says everything's great and keeps acting like everything's nice.
[02:33:02.427 --> 02:33:04.869]  Their job is to keep this facade going.
[02:33:06.184 --> 02:33:09.948]  And a man said earlier that I'm probably the most important media presence in the country.
[02:33:10.489 --> 02:33:11.289]  I don't agree with that.
[02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:17.856]  I think I'm the most important media presence he listens to on shortwave or internet or AM or FM in his area.
[02:33:19.338 --> 02:33:24.243]  There are thousands of authors, thousands of radio talk show hosts,
[02:33:25.514 --> 02:33:28.236]  There are thousands of these websites.
[02:33:28.276 --> 02:33:29.376]  There are more people.
[02:33:29.456 --> 02:33:31.617]  Big meetings all over the country.
[02:33:31.657 --> 02:33:36.880]  People finally realizing how serious it is and knowing who the terrorists are.
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:41.602]  So when the globalists blow more stuff up and try to act like our saviors, people know who really did it.
[02:33:41.982 --> 02:33:45.284]  And that's why I keep hammering home, get Police State 2000.
[02:33:46.264 --> 02:33:47.645]  Police State to the takeover.
[02:33:47.785 --> 02:33:49.506]  Now, just released yesterday.
[02:33:49.926 --> 02:33:51.086]  Police State 3.
[02:33:51.527 --> 02:33:52.787]  Total enslavement.
[02:33:53.027 --> 02:33:54.188]  This baby's done.
[02:33:55.131 --> 02:33:56.111]  And I hope you get it.
[02:33:56.191 --> 02:33:58.092]  Police State 3, total enslavement.
[02:33:59.652 --> 02:34:01.313]  Two hours and 37 minutes.
[02:34:01.433 --> 02:34:02.753]  People need to know the truth.
[02:34:02.773 --> 02:34:19.037]  And if the thousands of listeners will just get 9-1-1, the road to tyranny, and part two of that, the masters of terror, and will make the copies and will give it to police and firefighters and school teachers and county commissioners and state legislators, we can turn this thing around.
[02:34:20.848 --> 02:34:32.552]  We can get the job done and have an awakening to what's happened here, how illegitimate this government is, how our government's run by the real enemy combatants, the overthrowers, the usurpers.
[02:34:33.433 --> 02:34:35.594]  They are the alien force destroying America.
[02:34:35.674 --> 02:34:39.155]  They are the neocon, the ultra-liberal, and the new world order.
[02:34:39.875 --> 02:34:41.056]  So I'm bugging you folks.
[02:34:41.256 --> 02:34:42.996]  Get 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny.
[02:34:43.016 --> 02:34:44.317]  If you haven't gotten it, you're crazy.
[02:34:45.387 --> 02:34:47.008]  Masters of Terror, part two of that.
[02:34:47.168 --> 02:34:48.849]  Find out who carried out 9-1-1.
[02:34:48.929 --> 02:34:50.130]  Have the hardcore evidence.
[02:34:50.250 --> 02:34:53.212]  Share it like your freedom depends on it, because it does.
[02:34:53.592 --> 02:34:55.473]  And then get the Police State series.
[02:34:55.773 --> 02:34:57.194]  Police State 3 now released.
[02:34:57.774 --> 02:35:00.076]  Call toll-free right now.
[02:35:00.096 --> 02:35:00.136]  1-888-
[02:35:02.617 --> 02:35:02.777]  888-253-3139.
[02:35:02.797 --> 02:35:03.057]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:35:03.077 --> 02:35:04.558]  Or InfoWars.com or net.
[02:35:04.578 --> 02:35:09.220]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, LAMAR, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:35:30.994 --> 02:35:37.837]  Again, that number, 1-888-253-3139 or infowars.com or net.
[02:35:38.378 --> 02:35:38.878]  It's simple.
[02:35:39.698 --> 02:35:40.839]  This is the Alamo.
[02:35:41.799 --> 02:35:44.261]  This is Lexington and Concord.
[02:35:45.141 --> 02:35:46.922]  This is standing up against the tyranny.
[02:35:47.699 --> 02:36:06.975]  And we're going to win this fight, but we've got to know who the enemy is, the enemy combatants that are attacking America, that control our government at every level, judicial, executive, legislative, that are whoring out our local governments, paying them off, controlling them, setting up massive taxation grids.
[02:36:07.663 --> 02:36:10.125]  We have got to resist the New World Order.
[02:36:10.445 --> 02:36:12.047]  We have got to do it now.
[02:36:12.367 --> 02:36:18.492]  And we've got to expose the neocon whores that are destroying this country as the vanguard of the New World Order.
[02:36:19.192 --> 02:36:20.453]  Tom in Maryland.
[02:36:20.533 --> 02:36:21.374]  Tom, you're on the air.
[02:36:21.414 --> 02:36:21.774]  Go ahead.
[02:36:21.814 --> 02:36:22.655]  How are you listening, Tom?
[02:36:24.797 --> 02:36:25.537]  Is Tom still there?
[02:36:26.418 --> 02:36:26.998]  Okay.
[02:36:27.459 --> 02:36:28.259]  Oh, sorry.
[02:36:28.379 --> 02:36:28.840]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:29.360]  You're on the air.
[02:36:29.941 --> 02:36:30.601]  I'm listening on 12.172.
[02:36:30.641 --> 02:36:31.102]  I know about 10.50.
[02:36:37.678 --> 02:36:39.439]  And I'm not able to receive it.
[02:36:39.479 --> 02:36:42.760]  I'm in southern Maryland.
[02:36:43.001 --> 02:36:44.241]  Okay.
[02:36:44.261 --> 02:36:45.802]  1050 is a little bit weak, I do believe.
[02:36:45.862 --> 02:36:50.144]  But anyhow, I called... The subject will get changed up a little bit here.
[02:36:50.224 --> 02:37:01.069]  Alex, I ordered a book some time ago from the BBC OA, and I did get my money back for the book, and I received a letter with it.
[02:37:02.249 --> 02:37:05.491]  And I didn't know, because I can't hear every show...
[02:37:06.098 --> 02:37:08.660]  I didn't know if you had ever discussed this.
[02:37:08.980 --> 02:37:14.684]  Well, I did address it, and BBC OA wrote a book about the Uniform Commercial Code.
[02:37:15.024 --> 02:37:16.024]  Yes, I have.
[02:37:16.104 --> 02:37:17.966]  Much of it was proven inaccurate.
[02:37:17.986 --> 02:37:21.328]  I don't know about all of it because I haven't tested it all in court myself.
[02:37:22.028 --> 02:37:26.491]  And they got raided under Patriot Act for exposing the criminal globalist.
[02:37:26.951 --> 02:37:32.575]  Erwin Schiff exposes the IRS is a private, and his book has been banned.
[02:37:32.615 --> 02:37:35.417]  They are now banning books in the United States.
[02:37:36.303 --> 02:37:48.432]  Okay, yes, because the letter says, January 8, 2003, United States Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against VBCOA, alleging deceptive sales practices.
[02:37:48.472 --> 02:37:52.855]  And when I got it and I saw that, I thought, well, that's kind of pinning...
[02:37:54.506 --> 02:37:59.331]  That's what's happening, sir.
[02:37:59.791 --> 02:38:03.474]  They're downloading what books you read from the major book chains.
[02:38:03.534 --> 02:38:05.016]  It's not just the libraries.
[02:38:05.536 --> 02:38:07.778]  Look, when I say Soviet Union, I mean it.
[02:38:08.299 --> 02:38:08.899]  Right.
[02:38:09.700 --> 02:38:10.821]  I have volume two.
[02:38:11.061 --> 02:38:20.750]  I have their second volume, and a friend of mine has actually gone through with volume two and volume three with filings and so on and so forth, and he could tell you
[02:38:21.281 --> 02:38:23.822]  Let me explain this, and I said this about B.B.
[02:38:23.862 --> 02:38:25.222]  Soe when people would ask about it.
[02:38:25.422 --> 02:38:26.502]  He had success with it.
[02:38:26.662 --> 02:38:29.083]  Yeah, well, most people do, but here's the problem, okay?
[02:38:30.123 --> 02:38:31.904]  This is what I'm trying to say about the government.
[02:38:32.444 --> 02:38:37.965]  People say, a guy called in this week and said, Republic of Texas was never properly annexed.
[02:38:38.045 --> 02:38:38.665]  It could secede.
[02:38:38.725 --> 02:38:41.686]  I said, yeah, but the globalists don't recognize their own laws.
[02:38:42.650 --> 02:38:53.794]  Hawaii was seized by the globalists and taken over, and the leaders of the government were killed, and a dictatorship was put in, and no one ever... You know, that's true, but what are you going to do?
[02:38:54.314 --> 02:38:57.655]  So, yes, the IRS is private, run for profit.
[02:38:58.135 --> 02:38:58.435]  Yes...
[02:38:58.875 --> 02:38:59.776]  There's no law.
[02:38:59.816 --> 02:39:01.397]  But they don't care.
[02:39:01.537 --> 02:39:02.818]  They don't follow their own laws.
[02:39:02.898 --> 02:39:05.640]  It's like the SWAT team's raiding this neighborhood.
[02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:10.484]  No drugs are found, so they arrest people for potting soil and say it's paraphernalia.
[02:39:10.864 --> 02:39:14.887]  For bottled water, you can now lose your house, your car, your business.
[02:39:15.047 --> 02:39:17.589]  It's now drug paraphernalia for ecstasy, sir.
[02:39:18.750 --> 02:39:21.092]  My point is, they don't follow any law, sir.
[02:39:21.152 --> 02:39:23.894]  They just... Right, I do agree.
[02:39:23.954 --> 02:39:26.776]  I'm not disagreeing with that, and I listen to you.
[02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:28.290]  Quite extensively.
[02:39:28.330 --> 02:39:35.496]  I'm anxiously awaiting... I ordered four of your videos almost three weeks ago, so I should be getting them very soon.
[02:39:35.536 --> 02:39:37.418]  I've been anxiously awaiting them.
[02:39:37.798 --> 02:39:47.507]  I just wanted to get your take or what exactly had happened, because I had never heard you talk about it, even if you did.
[02:39:47.527 --> 02:39:49.129]  I didn't hear it.
[02:39:49.929 --> 02:39:51.010]  Like I said, a friend had...
[02:39:53.374 --> 02:39:57.617]  A bit of success with it, and he did loan me the third volume of the book, and I have been reading it.
[02:39:57.977 --> 02:40:02.400]  Well, sir, this is what the bankers do.
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:06.984]  I've got to let you go, but I appreciate the call, Tom, from there in Maryland.
[02:40:07.004 --> 02:40:08.305]  Please spread the word about the show.
[02:40:09.826 --> 02:40:11.947]  Again, we take three weeks for shipping videos.
[02:40:12.007 --> 02:40:13.108]  We really ship them every week.
[02:40:13.746 --> 02:40:17.828]  But if you mail us a letter, it might take three days.
[02:40:17.868 --> 02:40:19.209]  It might take two weeks to get to us.
[02:40:19.769 --> 02:40:23.531]  We found with mail orders, we have to get your letter, and it takes a few days to process it.
[02:40:23.551 --> 02:40:24.411]  We mail it priority mail.
[02:40:24.872 --> 02:40:26.032]  Priority mail says three days.
[02:40:26.072 --> 02:40:26.693]  That's not true.
[02:40:27.193 --> 02:40:28.253]  Sometimes it takes two days.
[02:40:28.273 --> 02:40:29.174]  Sometimes it takes two weeks.
[02:40:30.073 --> 02:40:32.814]  But here on air, I don't handle the customer service.
[02:40:32.874 --> 02:40:37.115]  We do have toll-free number 1-888-253-3139, or you can also call 512-291-5750, and you can also email us.
[02:40:37.155 --> 02:40:43.937]  We have a very small staff, but you've heard of the listeners that got their films, and thank you for ordering them.
[02:40:54.525 --> 02:40:56.887]  What we have a big problem with is people move.
[02:40:56.987 --> 02:41:00.710]  Like, just the other day, a package came back and said, Abandoned at post office.
[02:41:01.071 --> 02:41:02.072]  A mail-to-a-PO box.
[02:41:02.232 --> 02:41:02.952]  Person never got it.
[02:41:03.553 --> 02:41:05.214]  And then, wow, lo and behold, an email.
[02:41:05.234 --> 02:41:06.035]  Where's my thing?
[02:41:06.075 --> 02:41:06.575]  So you know what?
[02:41:06.956 --> 02:41:08.117]  We'll send it back to you.
[02:41:08.197 --> 02:41:10.038]  It'll cost me four bucks, plus our people.
[02:41:10.899 --> 02:41:16.184]  And we'll just keep letting it hit that post office box until that post office box fills up.
[02:41:16.204 --> 02:41:20.087]  They send it right back to me, and I'll send it again and again and again and again.
[02:41:21.448 --> 02:41:22.149]  Same thing with Canada.
[02:41:23.041 --> 02:41:28.233]  About 99% of people get it pretty easy, but I don't know why people call me on the air about stuff because I don't handle it.
[02:41:28.273 --> 02:41:29.315]  It goes in one ear and out the other.
[02:41:29.355 --> 02:41:29.756]  I'm sorry.
[02:41:29.776 --> 02:41:30.578]  I just can't help you.
[02:41:31.079 --> 02:41:33.264]  We're not a big New World Order company, so we'll be right back.
[02:41:33.284 --> 02:41:33.624]  Stay with me.
[02:41:37.387 --> 02:41:44.753]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:45.033 --> 02:41:49.777]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:49.997 --> 02:41:55.642]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.882 --> 02:42:00.404]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:42:00.645 --> 02:42:07.788]  The casual society control grid, impalpable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:42:07.808 --> 02:42:12.351]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:42:12.511 --> 02:42:15.012]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:42:15.252 --> 02:42:21.956]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:42:22.196 --> 02:42:27.463]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:27.483 --> 02:42:27.883]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:36.414 --> 02:42:47.142]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:42:47.322 --> 02:42:54.928]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:55.208 --> 02:42:58.290]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:42:58.550 --> 02:43:04.312]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:43:04.592 --> 02:43:10.754]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:43:11.114 --> 02:43:14.995]  The Berkeley light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:43:15.055 --> 02:43:16.916]  The water level is always visible.
[02:43:17.136 --> 02:43:23.063]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:43:23.303 --> 02:43:27.248]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:43:27.268 --> 02:43:27.849]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:43:37.648 --> 02:43:43.596]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:43:43.836 --> 02:43:46.079]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:43:46.279 --> 02:43:52.627]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:43:52.967 --> 02:43:53.608]  We're good to go.
[02:44:13.422 --> 02:44:13.822]  We're good to go.
[02:44:42.882 --> 02:44:45.863]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[02:44:46.483 --> 02:44:49.084]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[02:44:49.484 --> 02:44:51.964]  I'm the guy who's a boss on this highway.
[02:44:51.984 --> 02:44:53.405]  All right, I said I could tell a lot of news.
[02:44:53.445 --> 02:44:54.405]  I covered some of it today.
[02:44:54.425 --> 02:44:55.645]  We've just been taking a lot of calls.
[02:44:55.705 --> 02:44:57.906]  They have been fun.
[02:44:57.986 --> 02:45:00.526]  But I don't think people realize how serious things have gotten.
[02:45:02.307 --> 02:45:04.728]  I mean, the government's discussing banning books wholesale.
[02:45:04.828 --> 02:45:07.428]  Judges are now doing it, just saying, you can't sell that book.
[02:45:08.068 --> 02:45:09.509]  Books that just give you the U.S.
[02:45:09.589 --> 02:45:10.469]  Code and where to look.
[02:45:11.425 --> 02:45:16.547]  And so that's why Erwin Schiff out in Nevada was told he can't sell his book anymore under threat of jail.
[02:45:17.167 --> 02:45:18.408]  Now banning books in this country.
[02:45:18.448 --> 02:45:20.548]  Same thing with BBC OA out in California.
[02:45:20.669 --> 02:45:22.569]  I really can't answer your questions about those guys.
[02:45:22.589 --> 02:45:24.410]  I need to get Erwin Schiff on, though.
[02:45:24.430 --> 02:45:26.191]  I've talked about the BBCO situation.
[02:45:26.811 --> 02:45:27.531]  And as for the U.S.
[02:45:27.591 --> 02:45:29.272]  Postal Service, they are something else.
[02:45:30.399 --> 02:45:34.782]  I keep saying I'm going to go to UPS, but that's going to cost people more, but I guess we'll just have to do it.
[02:45:34.822 --> 02:45:35.643]  We're very close.
[02:45:35.663 --> 02:45:37.704]  We've now got to, we're signed up with them.
[02:45:37.744 --> 02:45:39.786]  I'm just not going to have both types of mail.
[02:45:39.806 --> 02:45:43.488]  And see, UPS doesn't go to post office boxes.
[02:45:43.508 --> 02:45:47.511]  I guess I'll have to have two forms of mail, and that adds a whole layer of bureaucracy.
[02:45:48.112 --> 02:45:53.916]  Somebody needs to send me a bunch of money so I can hire some more staff to handle all that.
[02:45:54.759 --> 02:45:55.760]  It's such a headache.
[02:45:56.340 --> 02:45:57.862]  But we are effecting change.
[02:45:57.942 --> 02:46:03.066]  You can download most of our best interviews at prisonplanet.com for free.
[02:46:03.106 --> 02:46:05.628]  We just pay for the bandwidth because we care about the country.
[02:46:06.289 --> 02:46:10.732]  And we also, you can make copies of my videos when you get them.
[02:46:10.752 --> 02:46:14.536]  I don't know who else says that, but I do for non-profit, not for sale purposes.
[02:46:14.896 --> 02:46:16.117]  You can make copies of my films.
[02:46:16.157 --> 02:46:17.478]  We are effecting change with them.
[02:46:18.319 --> 02:46:19.700]  Rob in Wyoming.
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:20.340]  Go ahead, Rob.
[02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:20.881]  You're on the air.
[02:46:22.065 --> 02:46:22.445]  Can you hear me?
[02:46:22.725 --> 02:46:23.106]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:23.166 --> 02:46:23.666]  Loud and clear.
[02:46:23.926 --> 02:46:26.948]  Hey, Alex, speaking of Ernie Schiff, you need to get Gary DeMott on.
[02:46:26.968 --> 02:46:30.170]  He's got the right theory in my way of thinking.
[02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:31.131]  Totally the right theory.
[02:46:31.678 --> 02:46:34.820]  And they could not get him on his... I mean, the globalists are out in the open.
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:36.381]  I don't really see any theories.
[02:46:36.442 --> 02:46:37.863]  I see a program of slavery.
[02:46:38.143 --> 02:46:39.424]  I mean, theory in the legal sense.
[02:46:39.504 --> 02:46:40.965]  He's in jail for nine years now.
[02:46:40.985 --> 02:46:42.946]  The government doesn't follow any rules, sir.
[02:46:43.226 --> 02:46:43.447]  I know.
[02:46:43.487 --> 02:46:44.607]  They don't follow any rules.
[02:46:45.228 --> 02:46:49.151]  He was convicted on something that had nothing to do... It was a fake conviction.
[02:46:49.191 --> 02:46:50.732]  It had nothing to do with his legal theory.
[02:46:50.772 --> 02:46:53.054]  They couldn't get him on that and spent five years trying.
[02:46:54.615 --> 02:46:58.417]  If you're interested, I'd sure love to hear something about it and get him out of jail.
[02:46:58.437 --> 02:46:59.138]  What else is on your mind?
[02:46:59.659 --> 02:47:00.981]  Okay, two things if I can get to them.
[02:47:01.081 --> 02:47:03.085]  One is the supremacy clause in the Constitution.
[02:47:03.125 --> 02:47:09.154]  The other is this law, attempted legislation to make spam a felony on the Internet.
[02:47:10.646 --> 02:47:11.926]  I tried to.
[02:47:12.287 --> 02:47:13.407]  Spam is commercial.
[02:47:13.707 --> 02:47:22.590]  It's got to be defined as commercial gain and that kind of stuff, not forcing complicit media to see the pictures.
[02:47:22.610 --> 02:47:28.952]  Well, sir, the White Patriot Act, too, is written, if your email goes to somebody wrong, you get live in prison in a labor camp.
[02:47:29.072 --> 02:47:29.272]  Right.
[02:47:29.572 --> 02:47:33.814]  Well, I was accused of spamming people many times right after 9-11, the Iraqi war.
[02:47:34.234 --> 02:47:36.975]  They leave their email addresses in the newspaper articles.
[02:47:37.683 --> 02:47:47.566]  And one guy, he shifts his email address so he doesn't have to receive these because he knows that he would be guilty of mispresion, you know, if he's alerted to the treason that's going on.
[02:47:47.846 --> 02:47:48.987]  Well, again, it's just tyranny.
[02:47:49.027 --> 02:47:51.688]  Nobody's going to follow any law under this.
[02:47:51.708 --> 02:47:53.969]  Make sure, I think it's back east somewhere they're trying to do it.
[02:47:53.989 --> 02:47:54.829]  I thought it was Virginia.
[02:47:55.149 --> 02:47:56.769]  Back to you Virginians or whoever it is.
[02:47:56.830 --> 02:48:01.151]  Make sure that spam is clearly defined as commercial gain and advertisement.
[02:48:01.630 --> 02:48:04.772]  Not forcing the complicit media to confront the truth.
[02:48:05.212 --> 02:48:05.612]  I hear you.
[02:48:05.632 --> 02:48:06.413]  I appreciate the call.
[02:48:06.493 --> 02:48:07.594]  I'm out of time, Rob.
[02:48:07.614 --> 02:48:08.674]  I've got to let you go.
[02:48:08.694 --> 02:48:09.935]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:10.415 --> 02:48:12.176]  Let's talk to Linda in Wisconsin.
[02:48:12.196 --> 02:48:13.157]  Last caller, go ahead.
[02:48:13.577 --> 02:48:17.460]  Alex, real quick, what that man was talking about on the money.
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:19.721]  This was on a program the other day.
[02:48:19.881 --> 02:48:22.703]  One of the things with the money, with the strip, when you get it,
[02:48:23.803 --> 02:48:27.005]  If you don't pass it on within a month, you'll be taxed on it.
[02:48:27.365 --> 02:48:28.666]  Oh, it'll be devalued.
[02:48:28.766 --> 02:48:32.488]  I reported that three years ago from the Federal Reserve Board of Virginia's website.
[02:48:33.348 --> 02:48:38.411]  A real good person to have on would be Donald McIlvaney, intelligence advisor.
[02:48:38.931 --> 02:48:43.373]  If you could get him on and interview him, he's very well versed on all of this.
[02:48:43.774 --> 02:48:46.635]  Well, that might be nice, but, you know, the Federal Reserve said it.
[02:48:46.735 --> 02:48:47.636]  They put out a report.
[02:48:47.676 --> 02:48:48.916]  I can read what they said.
[02:48:50.877 --> 02:48:51.758]  That's pretty good, too, huh?
[02:48:51.798 --> 02:48:51.998]  Mm-hmm.
[02:48:52.856 --> 02:48:59.021]  Yeah, but as I just said, it would be nice to have him on because he's been doing this for years.
[02:48:59.201 --> 02:49:00.082]  Yeah, I'll probably do that.
[02:49:00.342 --> 02:49:01.523]  I'm sorry I'm out of time, Linda.
[02:49:01.883 --> 02:49:02.724]  I apologize.
[02:49:02.744 --> 02:49:06.006]  I'm out of time, folks, and I get irritated when I run out of time.
[02:49:06.026 --> 02:49:08.749]  I don't have time to get to everybody, but thanks for joining me today.
[02:49:09.569 --> 02:49:19.759]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, on your AM or FM dial, or Global Shortwave at 51085 or 6890, the internet at infowars.com or net.
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:24.504]  Get out there, fight the New World Order, and I have released Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[02:49:26.706 --> 02:49:29.429]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[02:49:29.689 --> 02:49:35.995]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[02:49:36.296 --> 02:49:37.637]  Would you like to make your assets make...
