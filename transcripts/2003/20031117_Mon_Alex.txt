[00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:06.565]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.150]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.851]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:18.692]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:20.153]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:21.834]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:26.196]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:28.998]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:29.893 --> 00:00:30.773]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:42.956]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:46.997]  Welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:50.058]  It is already Monday, the 17th of November.
[00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:55.888]  2003.
[00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:55.888]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:56.508 --> 00:01:16.656]  I have Paul Joseph Watson in 30 minutes for a quick half-hour report from England, where they're basically setting up martial law ahead of the visit of his lordship, George W. Bush, who now has said he won't even speak to the British Parliament.
[00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:21.318]  He already canceled the speech before the EU because they didn't promise beforehand...
[00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:26.280]  To clap for him and only show support.
[00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:35.584]  And now he's canceled the meeting before Parliament because they have said that they will not order members of Parliament to not heckle him.
[00:01:37.304 --> 00:01:40.645]  And, of course, Ashcroft won't show up for any public events.
[00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:45.927]  Most of the administration won't because they're booed and protested everywhere they go.
[00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:47.428]  This is unprecedented.
[00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:51.324]  This is for six-month-old babies.
[00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:23.508]  On Infowars.com, on PrisonPlanet.com, we've got the original articles clipping out of Washington State on this.
[00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:24.268]  U.S.
[00:02:24.348 --> 00:02:26.609]  probes Iraq helicopter crash.
[00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.910]  Two of them collided, we're told.
[00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.670]  It wasn't rockets this time.
[00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:32.191]  U.S.
[00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:35.832]  agrees to international control of its troops in Iraq.
[00:02:35.892 --> 00:02:37.212]  I told you that was coming.
[00:02:37.753 --> 00:02:42.054]  After we're made to look like the bad guys and to lose the war, then the U.N.
[00:02:42.114 --> 00:02:43.314]  comes in as the good cop.
[00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:44.675]  We'll get to that article.
[00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.731]  Here on the show.
[00:02:48.692 --> 00:02:52.435]  Also, CIA finds no evidence Hussein sought to arm terrorists.
[00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:56.439]  After they said he was, now they admit that they were, quote, mistaken.
[00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.919]  Yeah, right.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.703]  Brain scan identifies race bias.
[00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:06.968]  Now, they announced to the BBC last week that all the British airports are going to get brain readers.
[00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.570]  It's total quackery.
[00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.911]  A listener called it a P.T.
[00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:10.852]  Barnum machine.
[00:03:10.912 --> 00:03:11.933]  A sucker's born every minute.
[00:03:12.717 --> 00:03:21.979]  We've proven that the lie detector test is a fraud, so now they're moving on to more complex black boxes, and the government will say, oh, you can't prove the computer's wrong.
[00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:33.162]  And I told you they're going to decide if you're, quote, homophobic, or they're going to decide if you're a hate monger, they're going to decide if you're a racist, they're going to have these in the public schools.
[00:03:33.402 --> 00:03:34.142]  Why do I know?
[00:03:34.222 --> 00:03:36.162]  I read federal documents two years ago on it.
[00:03:36.442 --> 00:03:39.123]  We're all going to be brain scanned for our safety.
[00:03:40.017 --> 00:03:41.378]  This is mainstream news.
[00:03:41.398 --> 00:03:45.622]  A brain scan that can apparently root out racist has been developed.
[00:03:46.743 --> 00:03:48.925]  Yes, we're going to brain scan you.
[00:03:48.945 --> 00:03:51.127]  I mean, this is worse than 1984.
[00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.191]  Worse than Brave New World.
[00:03:55.832 --> 00:03:57.033]  So the tales of that coming up.
[00:03:57.233 --> 00:03:59.956]  World Bank okays Caspian Pipeline Financing.
[00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:06.853]  I found a great website that has... You've been wondering what all those things are on red lights on the highways.
[00:04:06.973 --> 00:04:09.493]  Well, they've admitted they're for reading your license plate.
[00:04:09.953 --> 00:04:11.374]  They're for scanning your car.
[00:04:11.394 --> 00:04:19.236]  They're for interfacing with the computers that are already in your car and have a little antenna.
[00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:22.937]  Yes, the tracking grid.
[00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:28.582]  So we'll go over some of the little instruments that are up on lights and poles.
[00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:35.006]  We're going to post these on Infowars.com so you can go look at them and see the particulars of it.
[00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:38.828]  That's just some of what's coming up here on the show.
[00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:44.472]  They've been having emergency drills all over the country, all over England, all over the U.S., all over Canada.
[00:04:45.993 --> 00:04:48.594]  Little takeover drills by the feds and the army.
[00:04:48.614 --> 00:04:52.937]  And a lot of times foreign troops are involved because they're going to be our helpers.
[00:04:54.036 --> 00:04:56.318]  I have a whole stack of news, mainstream news on that.
[00:04:56.838 --> 00:05:03.402]  It's all online at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[00:05:04.483 --> 00:05:05.063]  Stay with us.
[00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:06.544]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:16.954]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.635]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:21.036]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.277]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:23.558 --> 00:05:28.440]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.863]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:33.103 --> 00:05:34.885]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:34.965 --> 00:05:45.613]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:45.773 --> 00:05:47.654]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:47.874 --> 00:05:51.717]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:05:51.817 --> 00:05:53.098]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:56.821 --> 00:06:03.908]  That's 888-253-3139 or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.889]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:09.574 --> 00:06:20.307]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:20.488 --> 00:06:28.077]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:28.297 --> 00:06:28.878]  We're good to go.
[00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.172]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:48.212 --> 00:06:50.093]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:56.217]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:56.477 --> 00:07:00.419]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:00.999]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:12.974]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name-brand medications.
[00:07:13.114 --> 00:07:16.276]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name-brand prescription medications.
[00:07:33.965 --> 00:07:34.465]  We're good to go.
[00:08:05.766 --> 00:08:06.206]  Don't wait.
[00:08:06.327 --> 00:08:07.107]  Do it today.
[00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:14.992]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:15.352 --> 00:08:17.694]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:28.340]  It is Monday, the 17th.
[00:08:30.814 --> 00:08:31.875]  Brain scan identifies race bias.
[00:08:59.477 --> 00:09:08.859]  A brain scan that can apparently root out, oh, we're going to root out racists, this is from Ananova, has been developed by scientists.
[00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:13.340]  The technique was used on white volunteers, shown photographs of black individuals.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:26.982]  If those with racist tendencies, a surge of activity was seen in a part of the brain that controls thoughts and behaviors, scientists believe this reflected volunteers' attempts to curb their latent racism.
[00:09:28.251 --> 00:09:29.732]  You mean they're late in tribalism.
[00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:39.681]  After interacting with real black individuals, the same group performed poorly in a task designed to test mental resources.
[00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:48.889]  The American researchers concluded that harboring racial prejudice, even unintentionally, stirred up an inner struggle that exhausted the brain.
[00:09:50.808 --> 00:10:13.664]  Dr. Jennifer Richson, assistant professor of psychology and brain sciences at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, said, we were surprised to find brain activity in response to faces of black individuals predicted how research participants performed on cognitive tasks after actual interracial interactions.
[00:10:13.704 --> 00:10:18.868]  The scientists first measured the racial bias of 30 white individuals using a standard technique.
[00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:27.474]  Now, understand, folks, that I'd like to see them show white people to black people and see what happens.
[00:10:28.354 --> 00:10:30.656]  Because I've seen the actual federal statistics.
[00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:36.858]  There's more black racial crime against whites that is racially motivated than there is whites against blacks.
[00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:46.223]  Now, a lot of this is economic, obviously, and on top of it, the media has played up how evil white people are, and so there's a lot of...
[00:10:47.532 --> 00:10:48.773]  We're good to go.
[00:10:48.853 --> 00:10:49.753]  We're good to go.
[00:11:08.593 --> 00:11:14.335]  In fact, multiculturalism actually creates division, creates all this anxiety, and that's what they're measuring.
[00:11:14.355 --> 00:11:20.278]  And that's why they threw out lie detector tests, because when they would get to the big question of, did you murder your wife?
[00:11:20.338 --> 00:11:22.119]  Did you kill the police officer?
[00:11:23.439 --> 00:11:24.980]  Did you take the bribe?
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:36.785]  They found that a lot of people would show increased heart rate, fluctuations in blood pressure, a tightening of the jaw,
[00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:40.961]  They would feed all this in and say, oh, this shows you did it.
[00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:42.823]  Well, no, it's a scary question.
[00:11:42.863 --> 00:11:44.584]  Did you murder your wife?
[00:11:44.624 --> 00:11:46.025]  Did you take the bribe?
[00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:49.767]  Did you embezzle the money?
[00:11:50.948 --> 00:11:53.150]  And so it's been proven to be totally inaccurate.
[00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:53.710]  It's a joke.
[00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.612]  It's the way the police would just say, well, we know you're guilty.
[00:11:57.555 --> 00:11:59.896]  And real criminals knew how to fool the machines.
[00:12:00.396 --> 00:12:04.338]  They would just get upset, the most classic tactic, at every question.
[00:12:04.378 --> 00:12:05.878]  You know, is your name John Doe?
[00:12:05.918 --> 00:12:08.019]  Do you live on blah, blah, blah Avenue?
[00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:16.522]  And the person would upset themselves, psychologically think horrible thoughts, think guilty thoughts, and that would then throw all the readings off.
[00:12:19.503 --> 00:12:20.183]  But it didn't matter.
[00:12:20.204 --> 00:12:22.064]  I mean, it was the FBI giving you the questions.
[00:12:22.084 --> 00:12:26.806]  They would just still say, well, it's obvious he's guilty or she's guilty or she's innocent or he's innocent.
[00:12:28.092 --> 00:12:37.698]  Well, now, last week they reported, and it's been in the news now for two years, that five airports in the U.S., all the airports in England, are going to get an MRI brain scanner.
[00:12:38.618 --> 00:12:42.160]  Now, you've got to pay $4,000 on average to get one of these.
[00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:46.723]  Yourself, if you've got insurance, you'll only pay $500 or something.
[00:12:48.003 --> 00:12:55.468]  But you've got to pay all this money to get an MRI, but they're just going to stick these big, fancy, newfangled NASA-developed MRIs
[00:12:57.745 --> 00:13:03.549]  Cat scans in the airports and in the streets, and they're going to scan your brain.
[00:13:03.589 --> 00:13:07.411]  Oh, that's not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, scanning your body.
[00:13:07.471 --> 00:13:11.674]  And they say, you've heard them on the news, well, we're going to measure your walk.
[00:13:11.734 --> 00:13:14.676]  We're going to measure the blood levels in your face.
[00:13:14.756 --> 00:13:16.157]  We're going to scan your brain.
[00:13:16.197 --> 00:13:22.742]  And with all of these three areas of data collated, we've got a biometric...
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:38.550]  Behavior metric, behavioral biometric, I believe is the term, system, and it'll collate it with the data and the algorithms and the assessment and profiles we've put in the computer.
[00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.952]  We'll tell if you're planning terrorism.
[00:13:40.992 --> 00:13:42.393]  We'll know.
[00:13:42.453 --> 00:13:44.715]  I've seen this before about two years ago in a federal document.
[00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:46.376]  We'll know if you're secretly a racist.
[00:13:47.197 --> 00:13:53.761]  At police stations, they're going to stick you under these and go, Why, the machine shows you're lying!
[00:13:55.602 --> 00:13:57.723]  And they put the face-scanning cameras in Tampa.
[00:13:57.743 --> 00:13:58.884]  Remember that two years ago?
[00:13:59.644 --> 00:14:03.387]  And furled a lot of this two years ago at the Super Bowl.
[00:14:03.447 --> 00:14:04.507]  And they put it on the streets.
[00:14:04.607 --> 00:14:10.771]  And they'd SWAT-team construction workers and SWAT-team businessmen or SWAT-team mothers with children.
[00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.232]  Why, it showed you were a bank robber.
[00:14:13.293 --> 00:14:15.694]  And in all the cases, it turned out the people were innocent.
[00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:19.930]  Of course, the argument was then, well, we're just going to fix the system.
[00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.250]  Well, that's not the argument at all.
[00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.631]  It's not, does your RFID work?
[00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:27.331]  Does your biometric face scan work?
[00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.972]  The question is, do we want this system?
[00:14:31.232 --> 00:14:33.173]  You see, they always get you off on a side debate.
[00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:36.134]  But the point is, this stuff doesn't work.
[00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.034]  Number one, the government can't be trusted.
[00:14:40.094 --> 00:14:41.355]  DNA is about 100%.
[00:14:44.113 --> 00:14:46.195]  D&A is a great way to catch criminals.
[00:14:46.356 --> 00:14:52.142]  The problem is the government is engaged in so many frame-ups, federally and at state and local levels.
[00:14:52.522 --> 00:14:59.029]  They've been caught in so many thousands of cases in Houston, Texas, alone framing people.
[00:15:01.354 --> 00:15:07.598]  The crime lab would certify anybody guilty with DNA without even having a sample if the police asked for it.
[00:15:07.878 --> 00:15:09.239]  That's now been in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:15:09.319 --> 00:15:15.783]  So, see, my point is, even with something that we know is 100%, the government can't be trusted to administer it.
[00:15:16.283 --> 00:15:23.348]  Hey, I'm for the death penalty, but I don't trust this criminal government that carries out more murders, more drug dealing, more crime than anybody else.
[00:15:23.748 --> 00:15:25.489]  I don't trust them to carry out the death penalty.
[00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:31.351]  You see, you have to think of the big picture here.
[00:15:31.952 --> 00:15:38.537]  But this brain scan garbage is total and complete propaganda.
[00:15:38.577 --> 00:15:47.945]  They stick a white person under a magnetic resonance machine, under an MRI, a CAT scan.
[00:15:48.685 --> 00:15:50.146]  They scan your brain.
[00:15:50.206 --> 00:15:52.268]  They show you a picture of a black person.
[00:15:52.288 --> 00:15:53.429]  You're riddled with guilt.
[00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:55.511]  You've been taught how bad you are.
[00:15:56.383 --> 00:16:01.905]  And that shows some brain activity in an area of the brain, and they say, oh, you're a racist.
[00:16:04.566 --> 00:16:09.328]  Folks, they're not talking about using this to, quote, look for terrorists and criminals.
[00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:10.889]  They've already put it in airports.
[00:16:13.426 --> 00:16:29.954]  And according to CBS News about a year ago reporting on this, you walk under it, and if your walk looks like you're upset or hiding something, and your brain looks upset, and the blood levels in your face look like you're agitated, they walk over and say, may we please ask you to go behind doors here?
[00:16:30.454 --> 00:16:37.777]  Then they sit you down on a machine, start scanning your brain right there, doing a medical procedure, and begin asking you questions.
[00:16:37.857 --> 00:16:38.818]  That's what they say they do.
[00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:47.412]  Millions and millions and millions of dollars of equipment.
[00:16:47.432 --> 00:16:55.059]  They said in the Boston Logan Airport it's over $4 million of experimental NASA equipment scanning you.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:05.569]  Oh, by the way, at those airports, those five, they also have the machine that looks through your clothes, gives you a nice crisp color image, detail like something right out of Hustler.
[00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.852]  And this is all being recorded digitally.
[00:17:09.352 --> 00:17:11.034]  By the way, that's your freedom?
[00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:14.519]  That's your freedom.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.321]  Folks, this is worse than Brave New World.
[00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:21.821]  This is worse than 1984.
[00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:26.742]  Again, I have television weekly news articles that are on Infowars.com, the news and focus section.
[00:17:27.102 --> 00:17:42.306]  I have AP articles where they admit the digital TV, when hooked to digital cable or any standard TV, is listening to everything you're doing, not just tracking what you watch and creating a detailed psychological algorithm and psychological profile.
[00:17:43.385 --> 00:17:47.589]  They admit your cell phones have Homeland Security, even when they're turned off, tuned into them.
[00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:50.572]  They admit all this.
[00:17:50.632 --> 00:17:52.373]  This is worse than 1984.
[00:17:52.633 --> 00:17:57.678]  Folks, we've been in this so long, we can't even recognize it anymore.
[00:18:02.342 --> 00:18:06.246]  So that's the new America, and we've got to protest.
[00:18:06.306 --> 00:18:07.427]  We've got to sue.
[00:18:07.727 --> 00:18:08.828]  We've got to demand justice.
[00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:15.686]  They just announced about a week ago on Austin TV that an additional thousand-plus cameras are going up in Austin.
[00:18:17.227 --> 00:18:21.611]  Folks, we had microphones by the hundreds four years ago in Austin.
[00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:24.313]  That's in Police State 2000, the mainstream news articles.
[00:18:25.614 --> 00:18:28.356]  There are now cameras in many of the neighborhoods.
[00:18:29.594 --> 00:18:43.099]  When I drive northeast, south, or west, every small town, I mean one-horse towns with too many marts and a courthouse, you drive into them, there's cameras all over the place.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:53.584]  They got antenna arrays, car scanners, license plate scanners, computerized interfaces for your onboard computer that they're now admitting is in your car.
[00:18:56.485 --> 00:18:56.925]  Cooks!
[00:18:58.004 --> 00:19:04.607]  Imagine, when we grew up, we heard about the Soviet Union, where people are trained to tattle and where they interrogate you and where they do all this.
[00:19:05.307 --> 00:19:08.008]  This is worse than Russia, worse than China.
[00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:10.409]  But now it's going in worldwide.
[00:19:11.709 --> 00:19:22.954]  And we just sit here and we just accept it, and then you talk about the thumb scanners going in for kids to get school lunches, the cameras in the bathrooms in the schools, in the classrooms.
[00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:29.244]  Cops all over the country going in, having all the kids get tied up in handcuffs, pointing guns at them.
[00:19:29.524 --> 00:19:31.245]  I see that every week in a news article.
[00:19:31.445 --> 00:19:38.147]  It's just big news last week because they caught video of it because the whole school was wired with hundreds of cameras.
[00:19:39.367 --> 00:19:43.489]  And they show the principal on there, and it shows bathrooms.
[00:19:44.189 --> 00:19:46.530]  He's got these hundreds of camera banks behind him.
[00:19:49.342 --> 00:19:50.623]  I mean, we're in 1984.
[00:19:51.344 --> 00:19:57.909]  And now they're promoting torture and secret arrest on the news and the sitcoms and dramas, getting you ready for the next phase.
[00:19:58.769 --> 00:20:00.030]  They've put the grid in.
[00:20:00.631 --> 00:20:02.172]  They've set the trap around us.
[00:20:02.972 --> 00:20:04.674]  Now they're getting ready to flip the lever.
[00:20:05.394 --> 00:20:07.496]  And we've got to stand up and fight them if that happens.
[00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:14.773]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.

[00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:34.247]  All right, my friends, Alex Jones here, back live, 24 minutes and 22 seconds into this first hour.
[00:24:34.267 --> 00:24:47.638]  We've got one of our regular contributors to the show, the webmaster and editor of PrisonPlanet.com, updated for you today, joining us because he's right there in England where a lot of this stuff happens and comes down.
[00:24:48.416 --> 00:24:52.879]  Talking about all the bizarreness surrounding George W.'
[00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:56.621]  's visit to the Enchanted Isle.
[00:24:58.002 --> 00:24:59.543]  So that's coming up.
[00:24:59.963 --> 00:25:02.985]  How he's refusing to speak to Parliament because someone might boo him.
[00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:06.227]  How he wanted no protests to be allowed.
[00:25:07.107 --> 00:25:09.008]  The authorization of the Secret Service.
[00:25:09.068 --> 00:25:11.150]  They don't even like how protesters look.
[00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.951]  Go ahead and mow them down.
[00:25:14.335 --> 00:25:17.897]  It's all coming up with Paul Watson here in about five minutes.
[00:25:18.097 --> 00:25:22.440]  You know, I spent a lot of time on this brain scan, finds out if you're a racist.
[00:25:24.521 --> 00:25:26.523]  Don't you see where all this is going, folks?
[00:25:29.325 --> 00:25:41.052]  And again, I cannot stress enough that any little town I go to, folks, I mean towns that aren't even towns, any four-way stop, any side road, they've got cameras now at them.
[00:25:42.665 --> 00:25:49.507]  And they're putting them up in our neighborhoods, in rural areas, and they announce a thousand more for Austin, Texas.
[00:25:51.608 --> 00:25:54.489]  And they said it's for Homeland Security and traffic.
[00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.730]  Why are they building this prison for us?
[00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.351]  Because they intend on taking our financial...
[00:26:03.488 --> 00:26:04.548]  System down.
[00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:09.890]  They intend on taking the private property of the general public and transferring it to the elite.
[00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.132]  This has been stated, and they know you're going to resist them.
[00:26:14.312 --> 00:26:19.634]  That's why even small police departments have been issued federal riot gear, have gone through anti-terror training.
[00:26:20.814 --> 00:26:24.836]  That's why foreign troops have been openly trained in this country for civil disturbance.
[00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:28.737]  Because they're going to bring us more terror attacks.
[00:26:28.777 --> 00:26:30.818]  But the good news is they would have already done this.
[00:26:32.136 --> 00:26:33.256]  They're behind schedule.
[00:26:33.296 --> 00:26:41.918]  Their own police and firefighters and medical workers refused, almost in total, to take the smallpox shot.
[00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:45.379]  They were going to force them to take it, then release it and force us to take it.
[00:26:45.559 --> 00:26:46.239]  I didn't say that.
[00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:56.701]  Gary Hart, Warren Rudman of the CFR Commission, who's on TV every day fear-mongering, said Dallas, Cleveland, Denver would be hit with smallpox.
[00:26:56.741 --> 00:26:57.681]  He said that a year ago.
[00:26:58.365 --> 00:26:59.566]  He said it'll happen soon.
[00:26:59.686 --> 00:27:00.467]  It didn't happen.
[00:27:00.867 --> 00:27:03.169]  Because they couldn't get their own enforcers to take it.
[00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:10.014]  Passively saying no to the New World Order, if you're in government, he is pretty good.
[00:27:11.476 --> 00:27:15.038]  You're not doing your duty, but you're doing at least something.
[00:27:15.058 --> 00:27:20.223]  Your duty is to openly speak out against this, to blow the whistle, to stand against this tyranny.
[00:27:22.144 --> 00:27:27.028]  And for those of you that can't figure out why a government would do this, why an elite would do this, you've just ignored history.
[00:27:27.998 --> 00:27:31.481]  Of how authority corrupts, how total authority corrupts absolutely.
[00:27:32.683 --> 00:27:33.764]  You've got to be ruthless.
[00:27:33.784 --> 00:27:37.808]  You've got to be cunning because of the nature of man to even be in positions of power.
[00:27:38.628 --> 00:27:46.456]  And on top of it, many times they have an enjoyment of abusing, an enjoyment of mutating, an enjoyment of dumbing down.
[00:27:48.129 --> 00:27:49.430]  They know what they're doing.
[00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.631]  They've got every major university in the country figuring out ways to control you.
[00:27:53.751 --> 00:28:00.254]  I've been inside the University of Texas Psychology Department, a giant complex run by DARPA.
[00:28:01.934 --> 00:28:04.095]  It's all mind control going on there.
[00:28:05.876 --> 00:28:08.597]  And I've just been in the unclassified areas.
[00:28:12.068 --> 00:28:13.229]  You're under attack.
[00:28:13.289 --> 00:28:15.250]  You better start recognizing that.
[00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:20.834]  How they ever convince people to think it's weird to say that government's corrupt or government should be watched.
[00:28:20.995 --> 00:28:25.538]  How did they ever twist your minds to believe something so ridiculous?
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.443]  All right, coming up, we'll give you an update on what's happening in England.
[00:28:32.763 --> 00:28:33.063]  Then U.S.
[00:28:33.544 --> 00:28:36.826]  agrees to international control of its troops in Iraq.
[00:28:37.086 --> 00:28:39.248]  That already happened months ago, but now it's being admitted.
[00:28:40.916 --> 00:28:44.557]  CIA finds no evidence Hussein sought to arm terrorist.
[00:28:45.517 --> 00:28:45.757]  U.S.
[00:28:45.797 --> 00:28:47.758]  probes Iraq helicopter crash.
[00:28:47.918 --> 00:28:50.378]  Walmart covering up I hate you baby toy.
[00:28:50.998 --> 00:28:55.039]  Paul Watson first reported on this after a listener emailed him the news article.
[00:28:55.059 --> 00:29:00.600]  I don't know, six, eight months ago out of the West Coast.
[00:29:01.581 --> 00:29:07.462]  A baby's toy, after it's put on an hour, after parents are out of the room, it starts telling the baby I hate you.
[00:29:09.565 --> 00:29:11.126]  And this is from World Net Daily.
[00:29:11.186 --> 00:29:12.466]  But right now, U.S.
[00:29:12.526 --> 00:29:14.347]  probes Iraq helicopter crash.
[00:29:15.708 --> 00:29:15.908]  U.S.
[00:29:16.048 --> 00:29:23.211]  Army in Iraq is examining the wreckage of two Black Hawk helicopters which crashed in the northern city of Mosul, killing at least 17 soldiers.
[00:29:23.231 --> 00:29:24.272]  It was the worst U.S.
[00:29:24.292 --> 00:29:26.813]  helicopter crash in Iraq so far.
[00:29:28.548 --> 00:29:29.588]  See, it's a crash.
[00:29:29.628 --> 00:29:30.849]  The other one killed 20-something.
[00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:31.709]  That was shot down.
[00:29:32.229 --> 00:29:35.030]  But officials are not yet able to say precisely what caused it.
[00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:40.632]  Some witnesses say one of the helicopters was hit by a ground fire and then collided with a second aircraft.
[00:29:41.292 --> 00:29:47.194]  Five troops were injured and one is still missing after the crash, which hit the 101st Airborne Division forces.
[00:29:49.294 --> 00:29:51.235]  But see, we're going to be removed now.
[00:29:51.835 --> 00:29:54.056]  Our troops will still be there dying, but the U.N.
[00:29:54.096 --> 00:29:55.676]  will come in and be the saviors.
[00:29:56.797 --> 00:29:57.537]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.373]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.895 --> 00:30:03.480]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.423 --> 00:30:07.111]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.663 --> 00:30:13.925]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:30:13.985 --> 00:30:18.147]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:30:18.407 --> 00:30:21.209]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:23.790]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:32.635]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:30:32.835 --> 00:30:34.176]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:30:34.356 --> 00:30:38.558]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:52.773]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:30:52.973 --> 00:30:59.460]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.642]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:13.911]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name brand medications.
[00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:17.194]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[00:31:34.887 --> 00:31:35.247]  We're good to go.
[00:32:04.787 --> 00:32:05.210]  Don't wait.
[00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.532]  Do it today.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.041]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[00:32:12.141 --> 00:32:12.621]  Pollution.
[00:32:12.661 --> 00:32:12.942]  Pollen.
[00:32:12.982 --> 00:32:14.082]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:32:14.162 --> 00:32:14.582]  Allergies.
[00:32:14.702 --> 00:32:14.983]  Asthma.
[00:32:15.023 --> 00:32:15.603]  Probably not.
[00:32:15.703 --> 00:32:16.463]  Well, listen to this.
[00:32:16.703 --> 00:32:25.688]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[00:32:25.748 --> 00:32:26.568]  Six to ten times?
[00:32:26.608 --> 00:32:27.669]  How can that be, you ask?
[00:32:27.749 --> 00:32:28.009]  Worse.
[00:32:28.109 --> 00:32:29.449]  Think about what's inside your home.
[00:32:29.609 --> 00:32:30.270]  Air spray.
[00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:30.870]  Chemicals.
[00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:31.870]  Does anyone smoke?
[00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:32.251]  Fumes.
[00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:33.971]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:32:34.432 --> 00:32:36.012]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:32:36.052 --> 00:32:36.773]  Toxic fumes.
[00:32:36.813 --> 00:32:38.213]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[00:32:38.233 --> 00:32:38.854]  Your sofa.
[00:32:38.874 --> 00:32:39.294]  Curtains.
[00:32:39.654 --> 00:32:40.175]  Into you.
[00:32:40.415 --> 00:32:41.215]  Into your children.
[00:32:41.276 --> 00:32:41.816]  Their lungs.
[00:32:41.956 --> 00:32:42.677]  Am I scaring you?
[00:32:42.997 --> 00:32:43.918]  Remember this word.
[00:32:44.298 --> 00:32:45.059]  Puritech.
[00:32:45.079 --> 00:32:46.600]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.842]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[00:32:49.022 --> 00:33:01.552]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[00:33:01.672 --> 00:33:02.933]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[00:33:02.953 --> 00:33:03.013]  888-491-4100.
[00:33:03.033 --> 00:33:04.094]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[00:33:04.194 --> 00:33:04.915]  Online at Puritech.com.
[00:33:21.537 --> 00:33:24.259]  Welcome back, folks, to 33 Minutes Past the Hour.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.821]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:26.522 --> 00:33:29.685]  I told Paul Watson I was going to have him up for 30 minutes today.
[00:33:30.205 --> 00:33:32.488]  I drive him on the show really each week because he has...
[00:33:33.317 --> 00:33:34.577]  Insight I respect.
[00:33:34.617 --> 00:33:38.098]  That's why I hired him to run PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:38.118 --> 00:33:42.080]  That's why I published his book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:49.102]  But I may need to keep Paul on a little bit longer because I want to talk about the story that he posted months ago out of the mainstream news, but it was a news clipping.
[00:33:49.962 --> 00:33:56.384]  And we've now found the original story online about the Walmart subliminal brainwashing toy for babies.
[00:33:57.927 --> 00:34:04.978]  And I also wanted to get his take on that because now it's popped up at WorldNetDaily, whether it's Terry Schiavo or...
[00:34:05.951 --> 00:34:07.912]  Or just hundreds of stories.
[00:34:08.412 --> 00:34:15.833]  They develop right here on these shows, on this network, and then get picked up by the alternative and then the mainstream media.
[00:34:16.574 --> 00:34:22.455]  But Paul Watson, before we go any further, first off, Lord Bush is coming to town tomorrow.
[00:34:22.475 --> 00:34:24.075]  He's going to be there through Friday.
[00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:31.017]  And a lot of interesting things have happened, including Bush saying he won't speak to Parliament now.
[00:34:32.256 --> 00:34:35.897]  Yeah, a lot of interesting developments out of this situation, Alex.
[00:34:36.538 --> 00:34:43.701]  First, we really need to focus on why the story which came out on Saturday has been buried.
[00:34:43.761 --> 00:34:49.923]  And the story was that MI5 and the other internal security services in Britain
[00:34:50.778 --> 00:34:56.181]  ...had been put on the second highest date of alert in anticipation of a so-called al-Qaeda attack.
[00:34:56.642 --> 00:35:10.790]  Now, your listeners may remember that the last time this happened, Tony Blair had tanks rolling around Heathrow Airport, and obviously it was conveniently right on the eve of the Iraq War, when the protests were reaching their peak.
[00:35:11.779 --> 00:35:22.147]  And in the book, Order Out of Chaos, in my book, I go into how this was used as a bullying tactic to intimidate protesters into submission, which is what we've got developing now.
[00:35:22.668 --> 00:35:27.632]  And it turned out that Blair had actually hired so-called al-Qaeda members.
[00:35:27.692 --> 00:35:29.773]  They knew it, given them jobs in the airport.
[00:35:30.054 --> 00:35:32.616]  It was all staged to create fear.
[00:35:32.676 --> 00:35:34.037]  That was even in the mainstream news.
[00:35:34.637 --> 00:35:44.152]  Yeah, that came out in the London Times that immigration had been ordered to allow these known al-Qaeda members through straight into London right on the very eve of when he issued that alert.
[00:35:44.989 --> 00:35:46.989]  And so we see the tactic again and again.
[00:35:47.049 --> 00:35:55.171]  Whenever a politically sensitive event is about to take place, these scripted terror alerts are issued with no credible information to back them up.
[00:35:55.231 --> 00:35:57.272]  It only comes out many months later.
[00:35:57.512 --> 00:36:05.713]  Well, it also came out that for Bush's visit to the Philippines, that the government, this was admitted, was blowing stuff up to blame it on the Muslim group.
[00:36:05.753 --> 00:36:13.875]  Turns out the Muslim group was founded, is run by Indonesia, according to the colonel who went public to keep martial law going.
[00:36:14.555 --> 00:36:20.897]  And to make it look like Bush was this guy who had all this courage to go to the Philippines.
[00:36:21.657 --> 00:36:34.941]  Yeah, and the actual, all the vagrants and the dissidents in places like the Philippines and Africa, whenever Bush is on the eve of visiting, they'll get locked up and put in camps, which is the same thing we've got with this visit to London.
[00:36:36.181 --> 00:36:38.242]  Finishing off with a fake terror alert, it's obviously...
[00:36:39.984 --> 00:36:52.792]  Ari Fleischer, the former press secretary, actually admitted that when people were asking questions about September 11th, when it broke really mainstream in May and June of last year,
[00:36:53.830 --> 00:37:04.136]  Fleischer said, and I've got the quote, he said, the terror alerts were issued as a result of the controversy that took place last week, and that was in the Washington Times.
[00:37:04.216 --> 00:37:11.640]  Now, don't we have, I know I've seen that posted on Prison Planet and InfoWars, doesn't Prison Planet have a fake terror alert section?
[00:37:12.352 --> 00:37:23.708]  Yeah, we had a fake terror alert section, but it was in the old format, so I need... Actually, there's a couple that I need to update to the new format, so... Well, we ought to just post a link to the old site that's still up.
[00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:25.010]  You have, like, 20 articles...
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:37.363]  There was the Capitol Hill Blue and the ABC News report where the White House, quote, in a memo said, issue fake terror alerts for controlled hysteria to protect us politically.
[00:37:37.603 --> 00:37:41.243]  Then Fleischer, which is why they got rid of him, every once in a while he'd slip up.
[00:37:41.303 --> 00:37:48.465]  He admitted Bush was on Cipro before 9-11, right through the Boca Raton attacks and the White House attacks and the Capitol attacks.
[00:37:49.546 --> 00:37:55.050]  He admitted that they were... He said, obviously, you saw what happened last week.
[00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:55.890]  This is for political.
[00:37:56.731 --> 00:37:59.253]  Why do you think Fleischer would come out and say stuff like that?
[00:38:00.534 --> 00:38:04.257]  Well, because it was basically becoming obvious that that's what they were doing.
[00:38:04.697 --> 00:38:09.861]  And we've seen many Bush administration members suddenly resign for no apparent reason.
[00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:12.864]  So it's obviously the case that some of them slip up.
[00:38:12.904 --> 00:38:16.947]  And the actual first line of the Washington Times article was
[00:38:17.427 --> 00:38:18.768]  Well, his quote was...
[00:38:37.939 --> 00:38:38.960]  This is a paraphrase.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.281]  I'm trying to make it exact.
[00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:49.647]  He said on Meet the Press, if you continue to frustrate our anti-terrorism activities with investigations, you're ensuring an attack larger than 9-11.
[00:38:49.747 --> 00:38:54.150]  And they're still holding on to the documents and editing them.
[00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:58.773]  So again, with the Bush visit, we see this same pattern.
[00:38:58.793 --> 00:39:03.116]  And some of the biggest protest organizations that have been out in the media today
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.742]  Now, also, they've banned protests in Australia.
[00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:10.784]  Two weeks ago, a man was arrested for sending a non-violent email to the U.S.
[00:39:10.804 --> 00:39:11.545]  consulate under U.S.
[00:39:11.565 --> 00:39:11.805]  request.
[00:39:11.825 --> 00:39:12.706]  He was arrested.
[00:39:25.523 --> 00:39:29.247]  You've got the calls last week to ban protests in London.
[00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:32.830]  Under public pressure, they refused, only banned it in some areas.
[00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:34.972]  What's happened with that?
[00:39:35.832 --> 00:39:39.556]  Well, yeah, we can take a look at the other cases and see the pattern.
[00:39:39.616 --> 00:39:48.604]  Indeed, there is this big movement on the part of governments in alliance with the media they control to abolish the right to peaceably assemble by means of...
[00:39:49.898 --> 00:39:56.140]  Infiltrating provocateurs into the crowds, filming the chaos, and then blaming it on all the protesters.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:15.704]  And we had this situation in Seattle in 99, which is documented in your police state videos, where the Black Bloc anarchists were hired by the authorities, protected in safe houses, and then when the police were ordered not to arrest them, they started breaking windows and rampaging on the streets.
[00:40:16.284 --> 00:40:18.165]  Same thing with Genoa in 2001 in Italy.
[00:40:20.869 --> 00:40:27.137]  I thought it was three times.
[00:40:28.218 --> 00:40:28.819]  Three times.
[00:40:28.899 --> 00:40:39.132]  More recently, we had the Senate bill out of Oregon, 742, which defined any protester who blocked traffic as a terrorist in the actual...
[00:40:39.767 --> 00:40:50.051]  Bill stated that they would be interned at a forest work camp, just as many peaceful protesters were arrested and taken to a FEMA camp during the Seattle protest.
[00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:51.931]  And that, by the way, is in the takeover.
[00:40:52.892 --> 00:41:00.914]  And then we can look at the situation in Oakland, where police were firing rubber bullets, wooden dowels, and concussion grenades.
[00:41:00.974 --> 00:41:05.636]  That was a quote out of the articles at anti-war demonstrators.
[00:41:06.266 --> 00:41:21.693]  We can cross over to Canada, where a few months ago a big report from the CSIS, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, said that they now considered animal rights activists and anti-globalization protesters as terrorist threats.
[00:41:22.153 --> 00:41:25.955]  And then you mentioned earlier the situation in Australia.
[00:41:26.898 --> 00:41:30.080]  And just continuing, your bishop who said homosexuals might be able to change...
[00:41:50.314 --> 00:41:50.775]  We're good to go.
[00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:18.693]  Well, yeah, now we've got the article out today which says that brain scans can identify racists.
[00:42:19.893 --> 00:42:25.616]  Another pretext for the government to go in and mess with genetic structures and so forth.
[00:42:25.656 --> 00:42:35.580]  Well, there has been discussions of, by law, scanning the embryos to genetics, and if it shows the, quote, racist tendency, total quackery, you may not be able to have that child, Paul.
[00:42:36.801 --> 00:42:42.103]  Yeah, and finishing off with the protest situation, the ban on protesting...
[00:42:43.622 --> 00:42:53.350]  In England in July of this year, the police used this new anti-terrorism bill that they got through after September 11 to arrest peaceful protesters at an RAF base.
[00:42:53.410 --> 00:43:03.678]  So from Canada to Australia to Britain to America, the same precedent is being inoculated that Kuwait is basically protesting with terrorism.
[00:43:04.779 --> 00:43:05.400]  And in a way...
[00:43:05.968 --> 00:43:12.774]  I mean, we're lucky because, as I mentioned earlier, when Bush visits Africa or the Philippines, they just lock everybody up in camps straight away.
[00:43:12.814 --> 00:43:21.222]  And now those same measures are being discussed within the Secret Service in anticipation of this Bush visit this coming week.
[00:43:22.478 --> 00:43:39.848]  And what they do with the environmental protesters is they have a couple on their pay, and we found out about this, they'll blow something up, burn an SUV, that's a government agent, then they can go out and call all the environmental demonstrators, many of which are good, speaking out against GMO, genetically modified organisms, food, and they arrest everybody there.
[00:43:39.968 --> 00:43:47.192]  So, Paul, it's clear they're getting ready for some really big events, and they want to have the troops, the president,
[00:43:48.548 --> 00:43:55.437]  The public condition for these mass arrests and riot troops, what do you see happening in the next 365 days?
[00:43:56.799 --> 00:44:01.145]  Well, in the next seven days, maybe we will see some kind of event because...
[00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:20.762]  There have been conflicting reports that have been coming out whether the Secret Service can actually kill protesters if they get too close to Bush this week, and it is confirmed that the Secret Service do have shoot-to-kill orders, the so-called rules of engagement, but the Home Office announced today that
[00:44:21.423 --> 00:44:28.645]  These agents will not have diplomatic immunity, so that basically means that they'll be operating under British law and will be prosecuted.
[00:44:29.425 --> 00:44:31.125]  But what we basically have is U.S.
[00:44:31.245 --> 00:44:34.346]  police patrolling the streets of Britain.
[00:44:34.766 --> 00:44:47.608]  And the BBC reported a month ago that in Scotland, Czechoslovakian and other Eastern Bloc troops, Ukrainian troops, were jerking families out.
[00:44:47.669 --> 00:44:49.769]  Women were crying, freaking out.
[00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:53.112]  Well, a few people complained, and basically that was the end of it.
[00:44:53.132 --> 00:44:55.054]  It was an exercise under NATO auspices, and basically...
[00:45:10.057 --> 00:45:14.078]  We had a similar thing happen in America around the same time.
[00:45:14.518 --> 00:45:22.600]  Ukrainian foreign troops just setting up checkpoints in the Scottish countryside and just yanking people out of their cars.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.280]  Well, that sounds like freedom, doesn't it?
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:27.121]  Yeah.
[00:45:27.901 --> 00:45:29.081]  You've got foreign U.S.
[00:45:29.121 --> 00:45:32.262]  troops, police stomping around, Ukrainian troops.
[00:45:34.482 --> 00:45:39.223]  I remember back in 99 when Delta Force hit Texas, they had Czech troops with them.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:48.964]  So we've got this precedent of creating this, you know, fluidity whereby troops from any country can police any other country.
[00:45:50.184 --> 00:45:53.286]  And this is what we've got happening with the Bush situation this week.
[00:45:53.986 --> 00:46:01.029]  Now, I have the articles here where they said we'll shoot protesters if they get out of line and not even violent.
[00:46:01.049 --> 00:46:03.450]  Well, just in Australia a year ago said they'd do that too.
[00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:05.751]  It's an obvious intimidation tactic.
[00:46:06.131 --> 00:46:08.572]  But why are they so afraid of people protesting?
[00:46:10.365 --> 00:46:17.850]  Well, many people have asked the question, why is Bush visiting a country which basically universally hates his guts?
[00:46:19.031 --> 00:46:38.705]  Because, obviously, on the surface it appears that it's a PR exercise, but then you look at the fact that there are going to be 100,000 to 200,000 protesters out there burning giant effigies of Bush, then obviously it's not going to look good for international politics PR purposes.
[00:46:39.477 --> 00:46:48.382]  So with the shoot-to-kill threat, the worst case scenario is that obviously they infiltrate some of these black block anarchists into the situation.
[00:46:49.002 --> 00:46:56.546]  Worst case scenario is that it would be a massacre, basically, because these Secret Service would open fire immediately.
[00:46:57.265 --> 00:47:06.951]  Hopefully that won't happen, but blowing the whistle on it beforehand is in a sense a preventative measure to stop them from actually pulling something.
[00:47:07.371 --> 00:47:14.555]  Now before the New York Times says that we're talking about black people, the black bloc is what the international anarchists, the
[00:47:15.095 --> 00:47:16.016]  It's 50 guys.
[00:47:16.056 --> 00:47:17.236]  They fly around the U.S.
[00:47:17.256 --> 00:47:18.417]  They've got a few dozen in England.
[00:47:18.437 --> 00:47:23.000]  They're publicly worked for the government, publicly are housed, publicly are trained, publicly are funded.
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:27.863]  I have newscasts, police, news articles in the takeover, and we see this all the time.
[00:47:28.303 --> 00:47:35.628]  These guys go around, burn a trash can, hit a cop, they videotape it, that's put on the news, and then, oh, we've got to attack everybody.
[00:47:35.668 --> 00:47:37.029]  It's like the fake video of...
[00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:38.010]  We're good to go.
[00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.631]  We're good to go.
[00:47:50.443 --> 00:47:59.867]  I mean, when we talk about black bloc, we don't mean black people, because they also have red bloc anarchists, which are socialist, communist, and green bloc anarchists, which are environmentalists.
[00:47:59.907 --> 00:48:03.749]  So it's just a different section of that movement, basically.
[00:48:03.889 --> 00:48:06.330]  Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not being sarcastic when I say that.
[00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:15.914]  Just in this politically correct system, they may brain scan us, Paul, and find out we're secretly Martians.
[00:48:17.418 --> 00:48:22.879]  Now, Bush has said he was going to speak to the European Parliament, cancelled that because they wouldn't promise to only clap.
[00:48:23.619 --> 00:48:25.580]  Now he's cancelled his Parliament speech.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.561]  Yeah, they basically scaled the whole operation down.
[00:48:29.981 --> 00:48:39.383]  According to the official timeline, he's going to arrive on Tuesday, and basically he goes to Buckingham Palace Tuesday, and that's about it.
[00:48:39.903 --> 00:48:46.825]  Then the peak days for the whole thing are Wednesday and Thursday, where the protesters are going to mass.
[00:48:47.686 --> 00:48:57.509]  And he's going to, Bush is going to meet with the family members of the victims of September 11th and both the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, so that should be interesting.
[00:48:57.989 --> 00:49:09.373]  Then on Friday, he's actually going on a walkabout with Tony Bush, I mean with Tony Blair, in his constituency of Sedgefield, so that's where something interesting might occur.
[00:49:10.749 --> 00:49:14.711]  Bush pulls out of speech to Parliament is the headline.
[00:49:15.192 --> 00:49:23.256]  George Bush was last night branded chicken for scrapping his speech to Parliament because he feared being heckled by anti-war members of Parliament.
[00:49:23.656 --> 00:49:23.897]  The U.S.
[00:49:23.937 --> 00:49:31.181]  President planned to give a joint address to the Commons and Lords during his state visit to Britain, but Senior White House Advisor...
[00:49:31.982 --> 00:49:42.980]  Dr. Harlan Ullman said they would have loved to do it because it would have been a great photo opportunity, but they were fearful it would turn into a spectacle with labor backbenchers walking out.
[00:49:44.585 --> 00:49:51.009]  And there's actually still arguments going on whether the Houses of Parliament, the actual road, will be closed to protesters.
[00:49:51.529 --> 00:50:05.138]  So again, they're trying to sideline the protesters so the media don't get a view of them, just like those Vietnam veterans who were against the Iraq War were basically shunted away from the main parade on Veterans Day.
[00:50:05.598 --> 00:50:09.740]  Despite the fact that they had Hooters girls and car dealerships and these guys signed up.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.541]  Here's another line from the article.
[00:50:11.941 --> 00:50:22.326]  The decision to abandon the speech came as extraordinary security measures costing £19 million placed London under a state of virtual siege ahead of Mr. Bush's arrival tomorrow.
[00:50:23.306 --> 00:50:28.489]  Yeah, they're talking about 12,000, 15,000 UK police and then you've got
[00:50:29.255 --> 00:50:30.756]  We're good to go.
[00:50:30.816 --> 00:50:31.116]  I think?
[00:50:42.794 --> 00:50:51.558]  He said that experts encountering biological warfare from Port and Down will be stationed at the Ministry of Defense during the Bush visit.
[00:50:52.139 --> 00:51:00.282]  We can go on into what Port and Down have been involved in and why that is a very dangerous thing to have those people crawling around at the time.
[00:51:00.883 --> 00:51:02.704]  We'll do that when we get back with Paul Watson.
[00:51:02.744 --> 00:51:04.224]  I'll try to hold him in the next hour.
[00:51:04.324 --> 00:51:05.485]  And we're going to open the phones up.
[00:51:05.505 --> 00:51:07.026]  A bunch of other news.
[00:51:07.046 --> 00:51:09.427]  We'll talk about the Walmart hate toy.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.720]  We're good to go.
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:12.380]  We're good to go.
[00:51:40.666 --> 00:51:41.506]  We're good to go.
[00:52:10.882 --> 00:52:11.282]  We're good to go.
[00:52:31.676 --> 00:52:34.459]  Free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[00:52:34.639 --> 00:52:39.605]  A quick process with the physicians at the online pharmacy and you can have your medications delivered right to your door.
[00:52:39.785 --> 00:52:47.113]  It's quick, it's easy, and it saves you money on popular name brand medications like diet pills and muscle relaxers or painkillers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:52:47.153 --> 00:52:53.120]  You'll save money on anti-anxiety medications, heartburn relief, or allergy control all without having to go to the doctor's office.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:53.721]  We're good to go.
[00:53:09.269 --> 00:53:13.612]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:53:13.792 --> 00:53:18.215]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:53:18.375 --> 00:53:22.758]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:53:22.858 --> 00:53:24.119]  A New World Order.
[00:53:24.899 --> 00:53:25.900]  Can emerge.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:30.145]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:53:30.205 --> 00:53:37.153]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:53:37.273 --> 00:53:39.276]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:53:39.656 --> 00:53:50.023]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:53:50.263 --> 00:53:55.627]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:53:56.147 --> 00:53:58.789]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:53:58.889 --> 00:53:59.929]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:53:59.969 --> 00:54:00.169]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:01.210]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:54:15.237 --> 00:54:17.138]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:17.618 --> 00:54:20.418]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:22.899 --> 00:54:40.923]  Every time I hear that commercial that we run for police state three total enslavement, concentration camps, foreign troops, Patriot Act 1 and 2, government-run white slavery rings.
[00:54:40.984 --> 00:54:42.944]  We have giant news sections everywhere.
[00:54:43.917 --> 00:54:52.984]  On prisonplanet.com, on infowars.com, with all these mainstream news articles, where, oh yeah, the U.S.
[00:54:53.004 --> 00:55:00.029]  government got caught shipping kids and women into this Middle Eastern country for slaves, sex slaves.
[00:55:00.129 --> 00:55:05.913]  Yeah, public officials all over Europe have been caught in the murder rings of children.
[00:55:07.034 --> 00:55:11.257]  Yeah, DynCorp admits they got caught in court shipping 200,000 women and children kidnapped.
[00:55:11.801 --> 00:55:14.182]  Folks, this is who's running the New World Order.
[00:55:14.483 --> 00:55:15.803]  They're not just criminals.
[00:55:15.843 --> 00:55:19.065]  They're the worst evil you can imagine.
[00:55:21.766 --> 00:55:26.849]  Paul, I want to get into what you mentioned about porting down and why they're deployed and how serious that is.
[00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:41.057]  But before we do that, how important is it for people out there to get order out of chaos, elite-sponsored terror in the New World Order?
[00:55:42.051 --> 00:55:43.953]  Well, it's important because we go into all this.
[00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:54.821]  We go into the fake terror alert, the whole paradigm whereby the government itself carries out the chaos to bring their order to this situation.
[00:55:54.861 --> 00:56:00.005]  And as I've said before, it's not just a book that scratches the surface of the New World Order.
[00:56:00.823 --> 00:56:07.345]  It goes into detail about how modern events are being perpetrated to advance this New World Order agenda.
[00:56:07.365 --> 00:56:23.350]  So it's both a book for beginners in the fact that it explains the whole Hegelian dialectic, and it goes into detail towards the later chapters about how these modern day events are being crafted to fulfill this long-term agenda.
[00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.971]  In a minute or less, how evil are the globalists?
[00:56:27.091 --> 00:56:30.392]  Is there any way to describe just how corrupt and wicked they are?
[00:56:31.514 --> 00:56:42.659]  No, and most people don't understand the fact that people by their very nature are evil, and people that get into positions of power have to be evil to get into those positions of power.
[00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:59.987]  Which is why when I get emails and things from anarchists saying, oh yeah, I'm an anarchist, this is the solution, then we have to explain to them that anarchy cannot exist because there always emerges a leader, and that leader is, by the very human nature of things...
[00:57:00.686 --> 00:57:09.329]  ...is evil, and most of the people below them aren't evil because they're hoodwinked into being convinced that they're serving a benign... Yeah, there's always going to be a strong man.
[00:57:09.369 --> 00:57:16.031]  That's why you've got to have a republic to tie the hands of government and the powerful, and that's what our founding fathers said.
[00:57:16.612 --> 00:57:20.833]  Folks, get Order Out of Chaos, elite-sponsored terror in the New World Order, over 330 pages, 1995, 50-plus documents and photos.

[00:57:44.468 --> 00:57:45.289]  Order three or more.
[00:57:45.329 --> 00:57:46.189]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:53.774]  Get the videos, make copies, get them out to opinion makers in your area, expose this evil.
[00:57:53.854 --> 00:57:55.235]  We do have an effect.
[00:57:55.275 --> 00:57:57.477]  We do have a chance to back this thing off.
[00:57:57.557 --> 00:57:59.838]  But if you don't take action, we don't have a prayer.
[00:57:59.879 --> 00:58:00.819]  Here's the toll-free number.
[00:58:00.839 --> 00:58:02.140]  1-888-253-3139 That's 888-253-3139
[00:58:13.286 --> 00:58:16.689]  Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order.
[00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:25.438]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:26.959 --> 00:58:30.362]  They make great gifts, great birthday presents, a great thing to give the neighbor.
[00:58:31.343 --> 00:58:32.444]  It's so important.
[00:58:32.564 --> 00:58:36.168]  Air them on AXIS TV, get them out to opinion makers, and get Paul's book.
[00:58:37.404 --> 00:58:39.206]  Okay, Paul, second hour's coming up.
[00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:40.407]  I want to get into Porton Down.
[00:58:40.427 --> 00:58:45.492]  I want to get more into the police state on this Walmart subliminal brainwashing doll for babies.
[00:58:46.512 --> 00:58:49.395]  I want to cover it all, so stay with us.
[00:58:50.256 --> 00:58:53.619]  Listeners, if you want to join us on air, your calls are coming up early in the next hour.

[00:58:53.719 --> 00:58:54.660]  We'll be back.
[00:59:00.467 --> 00:59:03.929]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:59:04.209 --> 00:59:07.711]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:59:07.791 --> 00:59:17.657]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed... This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:26.202 --> 00:59:28.483]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:59:29.276 --> 00:59:30.377]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:31.017 --> 00:59:31.837]  You want answers?
[00:59:32.618 --> 00:59:33.498]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:33.518 --> 00:59:37.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:42.462]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:42.662 --> 00:59:54.287]  All right, folks, we're already into the second hour.
[00:59:54.347 --> 00:59:56.188]  Total free number to join us on air.
[00:59:56.248 --> 00:59:57.609]  Any issue you'd like to discuss?
[00:59:57.709 --> 00:59:58.429]  Any news item?
[00:59:59.884 --> 01:00:00.204]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:00.645 --> 01:00:12.535]  And we're talking to Paul Joseph Watson, who I routinely have on the show, probably about once every two weeks, but now every week because he has great insight.
[01:00:13.095 --> 01:00:15.497]  Webmaster for prisonplanet.com.
[01:00:15.517 --> 01:00:17.459]  We're talking about Bush headed to England.
[01:00:18.019 --> 01:00:19.601]  Basic martial law has been set up.
[01:00:19.621 --> 01:00:22.543]  They say the secret service will shoot to kill anybody that doesn't follow orders.
[01:00:23.163 --> 01:00:25.866]  He won't speak to Parliament because somebody might boo him.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.321]  Well, it's concerning because...
[01:00:53.153 --> 01:00:57.910]  Obviously, as Gordon Thomas reported in the American Free Press over the weekend...
[01:00:58.524 --> 01:01:04.968]  These biowarfare experts will be crawling around London, stationed at the Ministry of Defence during Bush's visit.
[01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:22.900]  Now, we know that Porton Down has links to all sorts of horrors, including the worldwide spate of deaths of top microbiologists over the past two years, including David Kelly, and direct involvement in releasing foot and mouth in England three years ago.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.302]  I mean, you were covering that on your radio show where
[01:01:27.807 --> 01:01:37.695]  It was supposedly sneaked out of Porton Down, which was a level 4 bioweapons facility with 50-foot electric fences and deep underground facilities.
[01:01:37.715 --> 01:01:47.142]  It was supposedly sneaked out of there by animal rights activists, which is obviously a blatant cover for the fact that they released it because it came directly from there.
[01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:52.807]  And Porton Down also, as late as 1985, was spraying biologicals on U.S.
[01:01:52.847 --> 01:01:56.009]  and British troops in the field in England and killing them.
[01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:57.010]  That is now admitted.
[01:01:58.331 --> 01:02:10.556]  Yeah, and it's actually got links back to World War II, where we had the articles that came out where plague bombs were released over Scotland, and nice gifts of that nature.
[01:02:10.576 --> 01:02:24.601]  It also has links to Fort Detrick, which is obviously... So they're a bunch of murdering killers, and they have a history, so murdering killers will be on the ground involved in this, and they love to kill innocent people, so watch out.
[01:02:25.345 --> 01:02:40.812]  Yes, they've got biological experts working for the British government who we've proven have carried out terrorism in the past, crawling around London during Bush's visit, after the media in Britain has been screaming that London will be biologically attacked for months now.
[01:02:41.583 --> 01:02:51.589]  And now this weekend, the most drills I've ever seen, bioweapon, chemical weapon attack drills with the feds and troops practicing taking over coast to coast.
[01:02:51.889 --> 01:02:53.590]  Very, very interesting, Paul.
[01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:23.605]  And on top of this, we've got even more overly paranoid measures including the fact that Bush's guest suite at Buckingham Palace was swept for bugs and this particularly baffled the British who said that it would be like MI5 checking Tony Blair's room at the White House for bugs.
[01:03:24.045 --> 01:03:36.012]  So it's very interesting indeed, and maybe we should be more worried about the fact, not the fact that they're checking for bugs, but the possibility that they may be planting something.
[01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:40.435]  Well, and even more than that, that's a great point.
[01:03:40.835 --> 01:03:50.741]  We have Bush on Cipro with his cabinet on September 10th, four weeks before anthrax showed up, so they have a nice history of this too, releasing weaponized anthrax.
[01:03:52.282 --> 01:03:53.443]  Yeah, and we can get into the
[01:03:54.324 --> 01:04:06.416]  Facts about the president elected in the year ending with zero, targeted for assassination, which is not something that we advocate, but it is something that has happened over the last hundred years or so.
[01:04:07.497 --> 01:04:14.343]  We certainly hope nothing ever happens to Puppet Bush, because that would be used by the globalists as a way to really expand the police state.
[01:04:15.024 --> 01:04:17.546]  We'll be back with your calls and a bunch of other news items.
[01:04:17.566 --> 01:04:19.288]  For Paul Watson, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:21.567 --> 01:04:25.912]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:26.093 --> 01:04:30.518]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:30.678 --> 01:04:35.044]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:36.425]  The New World Order.
[01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:38.207]  Can emerge.
[01:04:38.228 --> 01:04:42.432]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:49.440]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:51.563]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:51.963 --> 01:05:02.288]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:02.568 --> 01:05:07.911]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:06:13.288 --> 01:06:14.270]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:15.713]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:06:22.398 --> 01:06:25.100]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name brand medications.
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:28.944]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[01:06:46.058 --> 01:06:46.839]  We're good to go.
[01:06:46.859 --> 01:06:47.259]  We're good to go.
[01:07:04.833 --> 01:07:05.093]  Don't wait.
[01:07:05.113 --> 01:07:05.433]  Do it today.
[01:07:05.493 --> 01:07:06.434]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:07:29.173 --> 01:07:30.273]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:31.734]  You want answers?
[01:07:32.514 --> 01:07:33.394]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:37.715]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:38.255 --> 01:07:42.316]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:51.682 --> 01:08:04.807]  All right, folks, we're eight minutes, 30 seconds into the second hour of global transmission as we blast out on the AM and FM dial from Rhode Island to Denver, Colorado, from Austin, Texas, to, I'm just told, San Diego here in the next week.
[01:08:05.967 --> 01:08:09.568]  By the way, I have to give that information to the affiliate relations.
[01:08:09.608 --> 01:08:10.729]  I forgot to do that this morning.
[01:08:11.689 --> 01:08:16.531]  And on top of that, we simulcast on Global Shortwave at 12.172 and 93.20.
[01:08:20.422 --> 01:08:27.644]  During the day from 11 to 2 and 5.085 and 6890 from 9 to midnight.
[01:08:27.664 --> 01:08:32.066]  And the websites are prisonplanet.com and infowars.com as well.
[01:08:32.086 --> 01:08:40.688]  Before we go to Rosemary in London, England, Joe in Mass, Elizabeth in Maryland, Ron in Oklahoma, Maddie in Oklahoma, and others.
[01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:49.871]  Before we do that, I promised to cover this, so let's just cover it real quick, Paul, and then we'll get to the calls and all this other news.
[01:08:50.703 --> 01:08:53.405]  This is on prisonplanet.com right now.
[01:08:53.465 --> 01:08:54.766]  It's World Net Daily.
[01:08:54.786 --> 01:09:03.691]  And I guess six, eight months ago, we posted the news clipping out of Washington State.
[01:09:03.812 --> 01:09:04.692]  Mainstream news.
[01:09:04.832 --> 01:09:06.233]  Walmart did pull the toys.
[01:09:07.074 --> 01:09:12.957]  A little seashore sleepy time thing you tie to the crib.
[01:09:12.977 --> 01:09:13.838]  Looks like a doll.
[01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:15.039]  It's like a fish.
[01:09:15.959 --> 01:09:23.480]  It tells the child, it sounds real nice for about an hour, then it starts saying, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:31.062]  And I've seen a lot of this in the toys, in the cartoons, in the video games, but for babies.
[01:09:31.982 --> 01:09:35.583]  And Walmart is at the heart of the New World Order, just like IBM.
[01:09:35.603 --> 01:09:37.183]  There's only a few corporations that are.
[01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:40.324]  We always find them engaging in this type of stuff.
[01:09:41.084 --> 01:09:42.664]  And now it's in World Net Daily.
[01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.214]  Walmart covering up I hate you baby toy.
[01:09:47.156 --> 01:09:58.213]  Walmart has yanked a baby crib accessory from its shelves after parents all across the country complained, and again we reported on this eight months ago or maybe longer, disseminates a subliminal message of hate.
[01:09:59.518 --> 01:10:00.679]  You've been on this since day one.
[01:10:00.719 --> 01:10:01.839]  What's going on here?
[01:10:24.508 --> 01:10:28.551]  Well, we actually reported on this originally more than 10 months ago.
[01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:30.732]  I was going from memory.
[01:10:30.752 --> 01:10:32.113]  It was more than eight months.
[01:10:32.934 --> 01:10:33.854]  Yeah, in January 2003.
[01:10:34.375 --> 01:10:45.522]  I actually got sent an original scan from one of the visitors to the websites of the original Columbian article, which came out in January 2003.
[01:10:47.781 --> 01:10:59.876]  The original report said that it was just this one toy and obviously the new development now with this World Net Daily report is the fact that every toy in the product line had this I hate you message.
[01:11:01.817 --> 01:11:08.586]  I see emerging from this the perfect pretext for the justification of RFID tax.
[01:11:08.606 --> 01:11:12.992]  We know that Walmart are the pioneer of RFID.
[01:11:13.012 --> 01:11:16.857]  They want all their suppliers to have initiated this system by 2006.
[01:11:20.325 --> 01:11:37.798]  It's the perfect pretext, using justification of protecting the children from Chinese subversion, because that's the line that's come out of the articles, that because these products are being made in China, that it's a sort of counter-offensive to trying to condition the young in America.
[01:11:37.818 --> 01:11:38.759]  So, again...
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:40.940]  Probably watch.
[01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:53.886]  If this story snowballs, then we'll see increased calls for RFID tags, not just on pallets of products, but on individual items, such as this toy that carries this message.
[01:11:54.266 --> 01:12:01.730]  And now they're getting reports from Washington to California to Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Maryland, and it's the whole product line.
[01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:08.693]  But, folks, I'm here to tell you that they caught Toyota in Toyota Europe and England.
[01:12:10.147 --> 01:12:14.309]  And folks, this is Times of London five years ago.
[01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:17.471]  And I have the article in my satanic file.
[01:12:18.411 --> 01:12:20.892]  They caught them in Toyota Camry ads.
[01:12:20.952 --> 01:12:23.954]  It's called something else in Europe, not a Camry, but it's the equivalent of a Camry.
[01:12:24.934 --> 01:12:27.996]  And in the ad, the father's driving to pick his baby up at the hospital.
[01:12:28.036 --> 01:12:30.957]  His mother went into labor.
[01:12:30.997 --> 01:12:34.139]  Or the man's wife, the mother, had gone into labor.
[01:12:34.981 --> 01:12:36.022]  So he couldn't get there.
[01:12:36.082 --> 01:12:37.383]  He gets word at his business.
[01:12:37.923 --> 01:12:47.110]  He has to run through the rain in his Toyota Camry, and in the background of the darkness, driving through the rain, is scrolling, and film students found this, just pausing it.
[01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:53.175]  It was there, clearly, that they admitted it, about satanic sacrifice, blood, the moon, killing children.
[01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:58.119]  Paul, why do you think they're putting this in so many ads and in so much of the media?
[01:12:58.319 --> 01:13:01.962]  To subconsciously desensitize us to murder and torture and evil?
[01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:18.629]  Well, yeah, and the point is that you get them while they're young, which is why you look at children today compared to even as recently as 10 years ago when I was, like, you know, 10, 11, the fact that children basically run about being complete delinquents.
[01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:21.111]  They're not interested in playing sports or anything.
[01:13:21.131 --> 01:13:28.236]  They're just interested in throwing fireworks at each other and watching Christina Aguilera and so forth.
[01:13:28.817 --> 01:13:31.138]  But you mentioned the Toyota ad.
[01:13:31.158 --> 01:13:31.799]  That was actually...
[01:13:32.521 --> 01:13:39.024]  Strangely enough, the time it came out, it basically won awards for the fact that it was the best ad in Britain at the time.
[01:13:39.064 --> 01:13:50.730]  And the actual soundtrack to that Toyota ad, which had the flashing satanic images in the background, actually won awards because it was the biggest selling advert in Britain at the time.
[01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:54.592]  And it was repeated basically hourly on British television.
[01:13:54.632 --> 01:13:56.853]  So the fact that it gets so much airtime...
[01:13:57.453 --> 01:14:04.579]  In alliance with the fact that it's got these satanic, almost subliminal messages scrolling through, is very interesting indeed.
[01:14:06.721 --> 01:14:11.906]  And if I remember correctly, from four or five years ago, back to the articles, it was big news, obviously.
[01:14:11.946 --> 01:14:12.947]  You heard about it at the time.
[01:14:14.508 --> 01:14:21.074]  If you look at it, there were film students studying it because it was so successful, and there it was clearly in each frame.
[01:14:21.849 --> 01:14:24.090]  So again, folks, who's running your government?
[01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:25.690]  I mean, we're not making this stuff up.
[01:14:25.710 --> 01:14:27.171]  This is mainstream news.
[01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:29.771]  And now, Paul, it's not even subliminal.
[01:14:29.791 --> 01:14:31.012]  I mean, it's right out in the open.
[01:14:31.812 --> 01:14:39.094]  You turn on the channels, it's either satanic, it's witchcraft, it's police torturing people, it's women kissing each other.
[01:14:39.114 --> 01:14:44.716]  They had a newscast in Austin last week about the new fad of young girls kissing each other and how wonderful it is.
[01:14:44.776 --> 01:14:48.957]  And by the way, the next newscast, a thousand new Homeland Security cameras going in.
[01:14:49.317 --> 01:14:50.898]  I mean, this is wall to wall, Paul.
[01:14:51.849 --> 01:14:53.675]  Yeah, and there's actually a story out today where
[01:14:54.292 --> 01:15:10.463]  Teenage girls across the country being suspended from school for re-enacting this so-called lesbian kiss, which MTV put out at the recent music awards between Madonna, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
[01:15:10.963 --> 01:15:18.708]  And even the recent European MTV music awards, I basically saw parts of it just flicking through the channels.
[01:15:19.128 --> 01:15:21.450]  The whole thing was dedicated to...
[01:15:23.677 --> 01:15:25.298]  Criticizing Christianity.
[01:15:25.318 --> 01:15:39.583]  I mean, you had Aguilera walking on in the nun costume and ripping it off and going into this devil song about, you know, being dirty and being basically a whore is now the new fad for young women to follow.
[01:15:39.743 --> 01:15:49.406]  And again, for young women and young men listening, folks, even the teenager magazines, this has been all over our news, promote homosexuality,
[01:15:51.457 --> 01:15:52.338]  Folks, this is happening.
[01:15:52.358 --> 01:15:53.158]  They're pushing it.
[01:15:53.218 --> 01:15:54.979]  It's not, oh, leave us alone, let us have our life.
[01:15:55.539 --> 01:15:56.720]  They're pushing it.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:04.084]  And again, the UN documents show this is to stop birth rates in the Western world, which are already plunging, by the way.
[01:16:04.104 --> 01:16:04.644]  We're dying.
[01:16:05.405 --> 01:16:11.028]  And then on top of it, it is to break down the family, because the family is self-sufficient.
[01:16:12.228 --> 01:16:17.251]  And then you've got even the biggest liberals out there, like Bob Geldof,
[01:16:17.981 --> 01:16:33.992]  Protesting against these teenage magazines like Sugar and Just 17 and that variety of magazines aimed at 13, 14-year-olds which are graphically describing oral sex, unprotected sex with men.
[01:16:34.312 --> 01:16:36.834]  And this is aimed at 13 and 14-year-olds.
[01:16:37.014 --> 01:16:42.337]  And by the way, this brought to my attention another one of these magazines targeting teenagers.
[01:16:43.158 --> 01:16:47.541]  And it shows boys who are boyfriends and how fun it is.
[01:16:48.201 --> 01:16:50.282]  To have their homosexual sex, folks.
[01:16:51.602 --> 01:16:51.963]  Folks.
[01:16:51.983 --> 01:16:57.605]  All right, I promised we'd go to the calls, but this is scientific to destroy the human system.
[01:16:58.545 --> 01:17:04.327]  Let's talk to... Who's the first caller from England?
[01:17:07.269 --> 01:17:11.870]  I was told... Rosemary from the United Kingdom.
[01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:12.651]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:17:12.671 --> 01:17:13.811]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[01:17:13.991 --> 01:17:15.692]  I just thought I'd tell you the latest on the...
[01:17:17.982 --> 01:17:40.437]  I got a call from my sister 10 or 15 minutes ago, and she says that an older lady, about maybe 50 years old, has climbed the gates of Buckingham Palace, and she's got a big message, she's got a flag, maybe a US flag, I don't know, and it says that, Bush, we don't want you, and she's sort of defying them to get her down, and she's still up there.
[01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:48.046]  Well, I'm not saying that she isn't acting alone, but it's that type of stuff that will allow him to shoot everybody.
[01:17:48.166 --> 01:17:49.026]  Paul comments.
[01:17:49.526 --> 01:17:50.846]  I'm not sure about that, Alex.
[01:17:50.907 --> 01:18:04.231]  I sort of think that she might turn the mood around because people are torn between, you know, this situation being used as a way to sort of fake a bit of a phony attack and clamp down on protest.
[01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:08.392]  And then on the other hand, you know, people do want to be heard.
[01:18:09.881 --> 01:18:12.962]  I wasn't able to watch it myself because I couldn't watch it and phone you at the same time.
[01:18:13.482 --> 01:18:16.103]  But as I said, maybe it will diffuse the situation.
[01:18:16.123 --> 01:18:16.523]  I don't know.
[01:18:18.284 --> 01:18:20.984]  How long have you been listening from England, Rosemary?
[01:18:21.404 --> 01:18:22.685]  About six months now, Alex.
[01:18:22.725 --> 01:18:25.746]  And I really appreciate being able to listen free online.
[01:18:25.766 --> 01:18:29.547]  Because when I started listening to the show, I wasn't working and I couldn't have afforded it.
[01:18:30.767 --> 01:18:31.527]  Well, absolutely.
[01:18:31.567 --> 01:18:32.248]  That's why it's there.
[01:18:32.268 --> 01:18:34.708]  And we have some of the best interviews at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:18:34.728 --> 01:18:36.929]  We've done over the last couple of years.
[01:18:38.163 --> 01:18:39.544]  Do you have any other comments, Rosemary?
[01:18:40.104 --> 01:18:48.450]  Not really, just that hopefully we'll be able to show our feelings here without it being turned around on us.
[01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:50.352]  But again, thanks for everything you do.
[01:18:51.199 --> 01:18:52.120]  Well, thank you, Rosemary.
[01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:55.745]  Are people there on the ground in England realizing what a police state this is?
[01:18:56.205 --> 01:18:56.966]  Very much so.

[01:18:58.848 --> 01:19:00.250]  People here are very solid.
[01:19:00.711 --> 01:19:10.082]  We realize that Blair has brought in a lot of Muslims into the country, a lot of foreigners in the last few years, but we sort of see it that he brought them here for a purpose.
[01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:16.414]  You're against how they're being used as tools.
[01:19:16.454 --> 01:19:17.435]  We'll call back any time.
[01:19:17.455 --> 01:19:18.135]  Great hearing from you.
[01:19:18.155 --> 01:19:18.776]  Okay.
[01:19:18.796 --> 01:19:19.416]  Bye-bye.
[01:19:19.456 --> 01:19:19.776]  You bet.
[01:19:19.816 --> 01:19:22.158]  Joe and Elizabeth and Ron and everybody else, stay there.

[01:20:22.859 --> 01:20:24.481]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:20:24.501 --> 01:20:27.043]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:50.962 --> 01:20:52.683]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:20:52.923 --> 01:21:04.889]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:11.573]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[01:21:52.394 --> 01:21:52.694]  Thank you.
[01:22:21.926 --> 01:22:25.467]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:26.127]  Yes.
[01:22:26.407 --> 01:22:31.229]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[01:22:31.349 --> 01:22:40.271]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[01:22:40.411 --> 01:22:48.113]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[01:22:48.353 --> 01:22:50.574]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.

[01:23:23.633 --> 01:23:29.679]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:30.279 --> 01:23:33.302]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:35.504 --> 01:23:38.527]  All right, we're already about halfway into this broadcast.
[01:23:38.547 --> 01:23:39.888]  We've only taken one phone call.
[01:23:39.928 --> 01:23:41.329]  I do want to take a ton of calls.
[01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.992]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:48.450 --> 01:23:51.572]  Let's go ahead and go ahead and go to these calls.
[01:23:52.012 --> 01:23:53.673]  Let's talk to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[01:23:53.713 --> 01:23:54.594]  Elizabeth, go ahead.
[01:23:56.655 --> 01:23:57.716]  Good to talk to you, Elizabeth.
[01:23:57.736 --> 01:23:58.296]  You're on the air.
[01:23:58.316 --> 01:24:09.604]  I hear you and Paul Joseph Watson bringing us the serious news, and you're to be admired for trying to stop some of the demonic deprivation that the youth have.
[01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:12.421]  Are you there?
[01:24:12.761 --> 01:24:13.261]  Yes, I am.
[01:24:13.441 --> 01:24:13.821]  Oh, good.
[01:24:13.901 --> 01:24:16.602]  And I do have a little surprise for you about the toys.
[01:24:16.942 --> 01:24:24.063]  I have a two-minute clip from my radio show that I told you about, and I hope there's a little humor in it, and I hope it'll work.
[01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:26.004]  Would I be able to play that clip for you?
[01:24:26.904 --> 01:24:27.304]  Sure.
[01:24:27.904 --> 01:24:28.424]  Go ahead.
[01:24:28.684 --> 01:24:29.185]  I'll try.
[01:24:29.245 --> 01:24:30.165]  We'll see what happens.
[01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:30.705]  All right.
[01:24:30.745 --> 01:24:33.705]  If it doesn't come through, we'll have to let you go.
[01:24:33.725 --> 01:24:35.366]  Department store.
[01:24:35.486 --> 01:24:36.546]  How can I help you?
[01:24:37.486 --> 01:24:38.206]  What's your name?
[01:24:38.226 --> 01:24:38.986]  Barb.
[01:24:39.047 --> 01:24:39.067]  I...
[01:24:42.114 --> 01:24:46.695]  I'm a little early shopping for the holidays, but I've heard about some new toys.
[01:24:46.715 --> 01:24:48.896]  You know anything about the evil Barbies?
[01:24:49.056 --> 01:24:50.476]  The evil Barbies?
[01:24:50.496 --> 01:24:53.137]  Yes, there's some kind of an evil Barbie.
[01:24:53.477 --> 01:25:00.759]  And then I heard on the Power Hour from Joyce Riley and Dave Van Cleist about an 18-wheeler truck.
[01:25:01.099 --> 01:25:03.400]  It has NATO markings on it and no U.S.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:03.960]  markings.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.701]  And I think my nephew George would like these.
[01:25:07.141 --> 01:25:08.101]  You have anything like that?
[01:25:08.201 --> 01:25:10.682]  Well, I'll look and see whether they're in stock.
[01:25:11.841 --> 01:25:17.587]  And I wonder whether they make a Harry Potter figure that tells lies and he can blow up his hand.
[01:25:17.928 --> 01:25:22.352]  I just think that my cousin Myrna would like this for her children.
[01:25:22.372 --> 01:25:27.478]  And then I also heard about some policemen that their uniforms are different.
[01:25:27.558 --> 01:25:29.500]  They don't look like our U.S.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.161]  uniforms.
[01:25:30.481 --> 01:25:31.462]  They look like Nazis.
[01:25:33.727 --> 01:25:35.108]  Oh, I love a Barbie.
[01:25:35.308 --> 01:25:35.908]  I love her.
[01:25:36.068 --> 01:25:36.669]  I love her.
[01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:38.450]  It's like my name.
[01:25:39.491 --> 01:25:39.751]  Barbie.
[01:25:40.011 --> 01:25:40.992]  I'm a Barbie.
[01:25:41.092 --> 01:25:41.453]  All right.
[01:25:41.493 --> 01:25:45.636]  Hey, Elizabeth, that audio quality is not the best, but I can't hear what you're doing.
[01:25:45.736 --> 01:25:47.257]  That's very, very funny.
[01:25:47.577 --> 01:25:49.679]  But it's not funny when you realize it's real.
[01:25:50.159 --> 01:25:57.705]  Most of the toys, whether it's Pimp Barbie or Drug Addict Barbie or Gangbanger Barbie or Nazi G.I.
[01:25:57.785 --> 01:25:58.126]  Joe,
[01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:02.271]  Well, yeah, as you said, it's only a clip, but it's not really a joke because...
[01:26:16.849 --> 01:26:24.874]  On top of all that, we have things like the Lego World Surveillance Truck and the Lego World Police, as well as the Wiccan Barbie.
[01:26:25.414 --> 01:26:42.924]  Tie this in with the Commander George Bush figure, and again, similar to the Walmart situation with the I Hate You toy, conditioning the kids to accept the police date, just as they are being conditioned to accept Big Brother within schools with all the security guards.
[01:26:43.424 --> 01:26:43.785]  You bet.
[01:26:43.805 --> 01:26:44.525]  Elizabeth, thanks.
[01:26:45.526 --> 01:26:46.046]  Are you still there?
[01:26:47.348 --> 01:26:48.028]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:48.108 --> 01:26:50.269]  It sounds like you've got a great radio show.
[01:26:50.949 --> 01:26:53.189]  Let's talk to Ron in Oklahoma.
[01:26:53.289 --> 01:26:54.090]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:26:54.130 --> 01:26:54.570]  Go ahead.
[01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.490]  Alex?
[01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:58.251]  Yes.
[01:26:59.291 --> 01:27:01.511]  First off, I've got Watson's book.
[01:27:01.652 --> 01:27:03.352]  It's absolutely fantastic.
[01:27:03.612 --> 01:27:06.373]  Tex Marr's book, Circle of Intrigue.
[01:27:06.973 --> 01:27:13.434]  Three of your tapes, 9-11, Masters of Terror, Police Day 3, Matrix of Evil, hopefully is on the way.
[01:27:14.115 --> 01:27:16.035]  Your listeners need to get these tapes.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.242]  They're really good.
[01:27:17.302 --> 01:27:18.303]  They're just fantastic.
[01:27:18.343 --> 01:27:23.312]  These last two books, Watson's book and Mars' book, are just unbelievable.
[01:27:23.432 --> 01:27:26.257]  They have so much information, and they fill in so many gaps.
[01:27:26.818 --> 01:27:37.367]  Well, and it sounds like you got Matrix of Evil, or as you were saying, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, or the Paul Watson book from InfoWars, Circle of Intrigue.
[01:27:37.387 --> 01:27:38.788]  We also carry that.
[01:27:38.968 --> 01:27:45.834]  And Fritz Springmeier, he just got sentenced to federal prison on a total fabrication.
[01:27:46.675 --> 01:27:50.779]  And I'm going to be talking about that later in the show, that book Bloodlines the Illuminati.
[01:27:51.019 --> 01:27:52.180]  What else is on your mind, Ron?
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:55.823]  Alex, if you'll let me hit a couple things really fast.
[01:27:55.883 --> 01:27:56.943]  It's kind of complicated.
[01:27:56.983 --> 01:27:57.544]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:27:57.744 --> 01:27:58.765]  I'll make it fast, though.
[01:27:59.085 --> 01:28:03.728]  First, this week, the History Channel is showing the men who killed Kennedy.
[01:28:04.129 --> 01:28:06.070]  Tonight, I think they show three segments.
[01:28:06.811 --> 01:28:17.439]  What I found really fascinating is our local newspaper, Daily Oklahoma and Sunday Oklahoma, and the TV Guide, for this week, I went to look up the series for the History Channel.
[01:28:18.098 --> 01:28:20.759]  I got last week's TV Guide and this week's Covered.
[01:28:20.939 --> 01:28:22.819]  It happened last year and another year, too.
[01:28:23.259 --> 01:28:24.239]  What is going on?
[01:28:24.659 --> 01:28:26.960]  How many is our media?
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:39.383]  And what we do see in the newspaper, they're promoting government storylines that Oswald was the only shooter.
[01:28:40.423 --> 01:28:45.164]  I think there are four or five made-for-TV stories
[01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:46.622]  We're on the march.
[01:28:46.642 --> 01:28:47.303]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:15.871 --> 01:29:18.573]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:29:41.905 --> 01:29:54.329]  www.vacationa2z.com A membership in vacationa2z.com will not only land you huge savings on air and hotel, you'll be treated to discounts of 10-80% on car rentals, golf, movies and theme parks.
[01:29:54.509 --> 01:29:58.790]  How about free food at restaurants or big discounts on ski packages at top ski resorts?
[01:29:59.011 --> 01:29:59.711]  Not convinced yet?
[01:29:59.851 --> 01:30:03.552]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[01:30:03.592 --> 01:30:03.972]  We're good to go.
[01:30:03.992 --> 01:30:04.872]  We're good to go.
[01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:29.749]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:30:29.969 --> 01:30:41.236]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:30:41.456 --> 01:30:44.117]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:44.458 --> 01:30:48.560]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.220]  We're good to go.
[01:31:12.051 --> 01:31:12.151]  803-4438.

[01:31:21.124 --> 01:31:24.627]  I have been on collagenate for three months now and I've lost 40 pounds.
[01:31:25.107 --> 01:31:26.569]  40 pounds in three months?
[01:31:27.029 --> 01:31:32.594]  Ann's another listener who took my advice and lost weight the safe and healthy way with collagenate from Vim and Bigger.
[01:31:32.874 --> 01:31:35.076]  I heard about collagenate through radio station.
[01:31:35.436 --> 01:31:37.498]  I've gone down about three dress sizes.
[01:31:37.678 --> 01:31:38.178]  I feel good.
[01:31:38.198 --> 01:31:38.839]  I have energy.
[01:31:39.019 --> 01:31:40.080]  I was really tired before.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.022]  I didn't have a lot of energy and I've got three kids, so it was kind of hard to keep up with them.
[01:31:43.162 --> 01:31:44.223]  But now I feel wonderful.
[01:31:44.403 --> 01:31:45.804]  I've had people notice quite a bit.
[01:31:45.864 --> 01:31:47.586]  They're coming up to me and they're saying, what have you done?
[01:31:47.646 --> 01:31:48.927]  And I went on collagenate.
[01:31:49.489 --> 01:31:52.653]  I have been on Collagenate for three months now and I've lost 40 pounds.
[01:31:53.226 --> 01:31:54.847]  Wow, 40 pounds.
[01:31:55.227 --> 01:31:59.030]  This was Ann's personal experience while taking Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[01:31:59.210 --> 01:32:01.532]  Why don't you see what Collagenate can do for you?
[01:32:01.832 --> 01:32:03.273]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.

[01:32:46.269 --> 01:32:55.931]  I'm going to throw out to Paul Watson, get his take on them, who's riding a shotgun with us from the United Kingdom on the eve of Lord Bush's martial law visit.
[01:32:56.311 --> 01:32:58.252]  Before we go back to Ron and others...
[01:32:59.807 --> 01:33:00.988]  I've made ten films.
[01:33:01.068 --> 01:33:03.929]  The tenth film is now out, Matrix of Evil Exposed.

[01:33:14.094 --> 01:33:21.658]  It's an amazing new video that covers the New World Order, their master plan, how they're going to engineer a worldwide depression.
[01:33:22.799 --> 01:33:23.799]  It gets into everything.
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:27.281]  You need to have this new video, Matrix of Evil.
[01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:28.762]  You need to have Paul Watson's book,
[01:33:29.421 --> 01:33:31.903]  Ordered out of chaos, elite-sponsored terror in the New World Order.
[01:33:31.923 --> 01:33:33.704]  You need to have police state three total enslavement.
[01:33:34.064 --> 01:33:34.925]  Great new video.
[01:33:34.945 --> 01:33:36.846]  9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[01:33:36.866 --> 01:33:38.987]  If you haven't gotten that one, that's the first thing you should get.

[01:34:19.835 --> 01:34:27.697]  And I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:34:28.337 --> 01:34:33.918]  Okay, Ron in Oklahoma, go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[01:34:34.218 --> 01:34:39.199]  Alex, for your listeners that don't really believe that your governments are really corrupt, let me tell you this.
[01:34:39.279 --> 01:34:41.119]  Now, this instance has happened to me twice.
[01:34:41.139 --> 01:34:41.920]  Twice.
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:46.040]  Last week, I got a military catalog, which I did not order.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.381]  I've never ordered anything from, okay?
[01:34:49.105 --> 01:34:52.187]  I ripped the address label off of it, threw it in the trash.
[01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:59.790]  This morning, the Oklahoma City Refuge Service picked up trash people, picked up my neighbor's trash at 8.30.
[01:34:59.870 --> 01:35:02.932]  They came back about 12, picked up mine.
[01:35:03.252 --> 01:35:12.076]  The truck drove up in front of my house, picked up my trash can alone, backed all the way back down a half block down the street, the corner, and drove off with my trash alone.
[01:35:12.737 --> 01:35:15.498]  This has happened to me twice, Alex.
[01:35:15.638 --> 01:35:16.418]  I don't do drugs.
[01:35:16.498 --> 01:35:17.399]  I don't do anything.
[01:35:18.622 --> 01:35:27.092]  Well, let me... Again, I mean, things can happen like that, but they don't have the number of personnel to really do that on even a small scale.
[01:35:27.831 --> 01:35:35.256]  If you subscribe to, say, Cabela's, or you subscribe to... You buy a lot of guns.
[01:35:35.776 --> 01:35:36.957]  I don't buy guns.
[01:35:37.037 --> 01:35:45.643]  People sell your... We don't do this, but a lot of big companies sell mailing lists to like-minded groups.
[01:35:46.223 --> 01:35:52.668]  And so that's what ends up happening, is you end up getting... I mean, I get so much junk mail...
[01:35:53.548 --> 01:36:02.031]  When I bought a house, then I suddenly got, I'm talking 10 mortgage offers to refinance every day.
[01:36:03.431 --> 01:36:04.392]  So it's incredible.
[01:36:04.712 --> 01:36:05.352]  I don't buy guns.
[01:36:05.452 --> 01:36:06.152]  I don't buy weapons.
[01:36:06.232 --> 01:36:06.872]  I don't do drugs.
[01:36:07.032 --> 01:36:08.793]  Well, I'll tell you what happens here in my neighborhood.
[01:36:09.193 --> 01:36:16.295]  They come down to get the trash on one side of the street, and the way their route goes, they come back two hours later and get the trash on my side of the street.
[01:36:16.315 --> 01:36:18.776]  Why didn't they get my next-door neighbor on my side of the street?
[01:36:18.796 --> 01:36:21.597]  Instead of going past their house, they backed all the way up to the corner.
[01:36:22.122 --> 01:36:25.305]  Well, you could have some type of state police investigation or something.
[01:36:25.325 --> 01:36:28.128]  Why does my telephone pick up AM radio on my answering machine, too?
[01:36:29.689 --> 01:36:33.713]  Well, generally, if they're tapping you, you don't know about it unless they want you to know.
[01:36:33.733 --> 01:36:34.554]  That's a floppy.
[01:36:36.015 --> 01:36:36.375]  Pardon me?
[01:36:36.395 --> 01:36:38.297]  But anyway, Alex... No, no, let's go back to this.
[01:36:38.337 --> 01:36:39.018]  This is important.
[01:36:39.747 --> 01:36:41.629]  I mean, I've been doing this for 10 years, Ron.
[01:36:42.370 --> 01:36:47.034]  And all I see is people waking up, police agreeing with me, having victories.
[01:36:47.054 --> 01:36:56.424]  And I just want you to know that all their announcements about Echelon listening to us and how the Total Information Awareness Network is going to get us, that's meant to be a chilling effect.
[01:36:57.170 --> 01:37:03.816]  There are tens of thousands of patriots in this country, and only a few thousand globalist spies and enforcers domestically.
[01:37:04.216 --> 01:37:07.639]  My question is, you may have somebody spying on you.
[01:37:07.679 --> 01:37:11.342]  Oklahoma's pretty bad, but I'm saying statistically you're the vast minority.
[01:37:11.582 --> 01:37:12.322]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:37:12.463 --> 01:37:15.485]  I don't want to create a chilling effect for the globalists.
[01:37:15.525 --> 01:37:16.286]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:37:16.466 --> 01:37:16.686]  Right.
[01:37:16.766 --> 01:37:18.007]  I understand what you're saying.
[01:37:18.187 --> 01:37:26.234]  I am just saying in this particular instance, I've used my cell phone, been working on a rooftop, and looked up a number of times five minutes later that a helicopter's flying over.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:28.961]  Well, that happens all the time here.
[01:37:29.021 --> 01:37:32.762]  I mean, we've got, there were Army black helicopters all over the city last week.
[01:37:32.842 --> 01:37:34.003]  I was walking in stores.
[01:37:34.303 --> 01:37:35.663]  People are saying, what are they doing?
[01:37:35.723 --> 01:37:36.364]  What are they doing?
[01:37:37.524 --> 01:37:43.006]  No, when they fly directly over you right after you use your cell phone, Alex, something ain't kosher.
[01:37:44.967 --> 01:37:48.128]  Okay, what would the cell phone tie into?
[01:37:49.429 --> 01:37:49.629]  Alex...
[01:37:50.922 --> 01:37:52.003]  They can follow you.
[01:37:52.103 --> 01:37:54.605]  Your cell phone transmits constantly when it's turned on.
[01:37:54.645 --> 01:37:55.085]  You know that?
[01:37:55.145 --> 01:37:57.287]  When you go from cell phone tower to cell phone tower.
[01:37:57.307 --> 01:37:58.668]  No, no, I really wanted to know what you were saying.
[01:37:58.688 --> 01:38:01.811]  Yeah, all the new ones have a tracking beacon in them.
[01:38:02.171 --> 01:38:05.233]  Homeland Security can dial in with the audio and listen to you.
[01:38:05.634 --> 01:38:06.154]  Right.
[01:38:06.434 --> 01:38:07.615]  Even when your phone's off.
[01:38:07.995 --> 01:38:14.400]  I keep the battery out of mine, and VoiceStream told me that somebody put roaming on my phone, but they can't take it off.
[01:38:15.221 --> 01:38:16.642]  T-Mobile, VoiceStream.
[01:38:17.503 --> 01:38:18.904]  Yeah, well, let me expand on that.
[01:38:20.107 --> 01:38:21.909]  The points you're raising.
[01:38:22.209 --> 01:38:30.618]  They fly over with the Army helicopters with huge ground-penetrating radar pods scanning every house in the city over grids about once a month.
[01:38:30.678 --> 01:38:32.800]  We're all under surveillance.
[01:38:33.341 --> 01:38:35.763]  They're videotaping the contents of our houses.
[01:38:37.705 --> 01:38:39.527]  Paul Watson comments to what Ron's saying.
[01:38:40.515 --> 01:38:52.206]  Well, yeah, the fact is that we're already living in a police state, I mean, but they need to resort to more sophisticated methods to make everyone aware that they're being watched to try and intimidate them.
[01:38:52.246 --> 01:38:54.188]  I mean, with the mobile phone situation.
[01:38:54.753 --> 01:39:11.373]  The technology is 10-15 years old whereby they can produce these specific tones that give out this docile signal which makes everyone involved in receiving these tones switch to a docile nature and they often use that in protest situations.
[01:39:12.034 --> 01:39:12.414]  But I mean...
[01:39:13.266 --> 01:39:14.167]  I get the same thing.
[01:39:15.049 --> 01:39:27.746]  We've got our own specific helicopter just for this little area that flies over my house every day, but in the end you just stop worrying about it because you have to point at them and say that they are the criminals because they're not allowed to do that and
[01:39:28.926 --> 01:39:32.247]  It's not going to intimidate me into stopping anything that I'm doing.
[01:39:32.287 --> 01:39:35.108]  Well, yeah, Paul, you had a friend visiting you from the U.S.
[01:39:35.588 --> 01:39:41.449]  If you're an Iranian with a plastic explosive, you can walk around to the airport, basically, if Tony Blair controls you.
[01:39:41.849 --> 01:39:45.190]  But when you had your friend coming in, they called you and said, what's your website?
[01:39:46.131 --> 01:39:47.971]  Well, what do you do, Mr. Watson?
[01:39:48.593 --> 01:40:03.727]  Yeah, I mean, it's all... We've seen the news stories about caps, too, and all the biometric integration with the airports and the fact that they're proposing to have every piece of information on you, which you have, and people are fighting this, but they already have it because...
[01:40:04.307 --> 01:40:20.500]  Someone was visiting me, and as soon as they landed in this country, the immigration desk had scanned through basically their entire life and picked out individual things which may flag them as potential... And if you've got bad credit, you may not be able to fly.
[01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:21.521]  This is the new tyranny.
[01:40:22.041 --> 01:40:23.082]  So we're all in it together.
[01:40:23.142 --> 01:40:24.503]  We outnumber them 500 to 1.
[01:40:24.543 --> 01:40:26.285]  We're going to win this fight, Ron.
[01:40:26.325 --> 01:40:26.845]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:40:27.246 --> 01:40:28.847]  Alex, the bottom line is,
[01:40:29.395 --> 01:40:33.098]  I don't do anything wrong, but it's nobody's business where I go and what I do.
[01:40:33.418 --> 01:40:33.739]  Okay?
[01:40:33.859 --> 01:40:36.661]  Who I talk to, what I say, it's nobody's business.
[01:40:36.721 --> 01:40:38.462]  I'm not involved in any criminal activity.
[01:40:38.663 --> 01:40:39.403]  But they are.
[01:40:39.483 --> 01:40:40.524]  They're the criminals, sir.
[01:40:40.544 --> 01:40:40.924]  I realize that.
[01:40:40.944 --> 01:40:42.906]  They're afraid that you're exposing them.
[01:40:43.166 --> 01:40:44.627]  They know you've got power.
[01:40:45.148 --> 01:40:46.169]  They're afraid of you.
[01:40:46.209 --> 01:40:47.189]  You've got power.
[01:40:47.209 --> 01:40:50.092]  Anything else, Ron?
[01:40:50.632 --> 01:40:52.093]  Well, there was another instance.
[01:40:52.293 --> 01:40:53.615]  Let me recount this really quick.
[01:40:53.655 --> 01:40:56.617]  I know one day, a slow day, I was out pawn shopping.
[01:40:57.458 --> 01:40:57.858]  And, uh,
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:06.867]  Everywhere, every pawn shop I went into, somebody would come in after I was there a couple of minutes, a few minutes, and look around, someone who didn't fit.
[01:41:06.907 --> 01:41:10.870]  Maybe someone who was wearing a suit, and just stick their head in the door and look around.
[01:41:10.890 --> 01:41:14.233]  At the time, I couldn't figure out how they were doing it.
[01:41:14.253 --> 01:41:18.416]  This was before I had heard you talk about the cell phone and how you could be tracked by your cell phone.
[01:41:18.436 --> 01:41:21.058]  Because I knew I wasn't being followed.
[01:41:21.784 --> 01:41:27.226]  I always watch my rearview mirrors, and that's good advice for anybody to pay attention to what's going on around them at all times.
[01:41:27.406 --> 01:41:38.390]  Well, I've got to tell you, a lot of times I've been in a shopping mall and have a guy with a suit following me around because they think I'm going to steal something, and they have a lot of police stings at pawn shops thinking you're trying to sell illegal stuff.
[01:41:38.650 --> 01:41:41.271]  I'm not saying that's what it is, but hey, Ron, I've got to go.
[01:41:41.291 --> 01:41:42.091]  I've got a lot of callers here.
[01:41:42.111 --> 01:41:43.052]  I appreciate your points.
[01:41:43.572 --> 01:41:49.354]  Let me just try to say this simply, and I'm not saying you're doing this, Ron, but the Patriot community as a whole,
[01:41:50.726 --> 01:42:01.491]  They spend most of their time talking about who's good, who's bad, what's going on, wives' tales, paranoia, all these things that are happening.
[01:42:01.611 --> 01:42:03.872]  I'm in a war in the trenches fighting the New World Order.
[01:42:04.293 --> 01:42:05.113]  I'm moving forward.
[01:42:05.193 --> 01:42:06.594]  I don't care what the costs are.
[01:42:06.974 --> 01:42:09.115]  I'm going to fight this thing, and I know mathematics.
[01:42:09.175 --> 01:42:12.957]  Let's say they've got 5 million people working in NSA, which they don't.
[01:42:13.504 --> 01:42:15.506]  They don't have 300,000 working there, folks.
[01:42:16.247 --> 01:42:21.652]  And most of those are janitors or people putting light bulbs in or people collating data, even with keyword software.
[01:42:22.533 --> 01:42:30.000]  Even if they have the personnel to listen to you, they don't have the personnel to follow you or the personnel to do anything to you.
[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:33.824]  They can pick out specific people here and there to go after to make examples.
[01:42:33.864 --> 01:42:35.005]  That's about it, folks.
[01:42:36.078 --> 01:42:37.979]  I mean, I'm a big fish in this whole thing.
[01:42:38.019 --> 01:42:41.101]  I'm kind of a canary in the coal mine for you, you could say.
[01:42:41.421 --> 01:42:43.762]  My only thing is they're the ones that should be afraid.
[01:42:43.822 --> 01:42:46.164]  They're the ones involved in all the criminal activity.
[01:42:46.384 --> 01:42:49.446]  They're the ones that have been caught kidnapping children by the hundreds of thousands.
[01:42:49.886 --> 01:42:53.368]  They're the ones putting AIDS virus in the corn associated press.
[01:42:53.648 --> 01:42:56.430]  They're the ones doing all this stuff, so they better watch it.
[01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.990]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:42:57.737 --> 01:43:03.540]  Well, yeah, and you notice that the people that do tend to hide in the shadows are the ones that more likely get raided.
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:14.685]  So the correct response, if you think that you're coming under that sort of surveillance, is to fight them even harder, and then that acts as a sort of protection against their illegal activities.
[01:43:15.485 --> 01:43:16.566]  Well, that's what I found.
[01:43:16.586 --> 01:43:21.108]  I mean, I got back during the Waco thing, rebuilding the church there as a memorial.
[01:43:21.128 --> 01:43:21.748]  I'm not a Davidian.
[01:43:21.768 --> 01:43:22.829]  I was building a memorial church.
[01:43:24.258 --> 01:43:25.459]  And it seats like 400 people.
[01:43:25.479 --> 01:43:27.080]  A lot of great folks got involved.
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:30.762]  And I got involved in the court case, the civil case, protesting the judge.
[01:43:30.822 --> 01:43:32.063]  And I got threatened, folks.
[01:43:32.684 --> 01:43:35.886]  And I just told them, okay, you know, I'm not going to give up my values.
[01:43:36.246 --> 01:43:38.047]  I'm going to fight for my family, for my country.
[01:43:38.387 --> 01:43:39.228]  They left me alone.
[01:43:40.534 --> 01:43:42.055]  So, I mean, a lot of it is this.
[01:43:42.195 --> 01:43:44.476]  It's probably state police if you're having problems, Ron.
[01:43:44.797 --> 01:43:45.817]  They get federal money.
[01:43:46.177 --> 01:43:47.878]  There's no real threats out there.
[01:43:48.619 --> 01:43:53.561]  And so most departments now have an anti-terrorism liaison officer who's federally paid for.
[01:43:53.601 --> 01:43:55.702]  The state police have hundreds of these guys.
[01:43:56.183 --> 01:43:56.843]  And they are.
[01:43:56.923 --> 01:43:58.024]  They're out doing stuff.
[01:43:58.064 --> 01:43:59.244]  They're out looking for stuff.
[01:43:59.605 --> 01:44:01.986]  They're out harassing fertilizer salesmen.
[01:44:02.586 --> 01:44:11.109]  They're out harassing school children who write a report about the bridges because they were told to, and that's putting the newspaper to scare everybody.
[01:44:12.349 --> 01:44:14.450]  But I hope that answers his question.
[01:44:16.251 --> 01:44:17.371]  Let's go to these calls, folks.
[01:44:17.391 --> 01:44:18.431]  I wanted to go to a lot of calls.
[01:44:18.471 --> 01:44:19.211]  It's not happening.
[01:44:19.231 --> 01:44:20.512]  I'm going to try to go to you quickly.
[01:44:21.252 --> 01:44:22.593]  Let's talk to Joe and Mass.
[01:44:22.693 --> 01:44:23.413]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:44:23.433 --> 01:44:23.793]  Go ahead.
[01:44:27.409 --> 01:44:32.291]  Archive, I was reading your concentration camp archive at your site.
[01:44:33.052 --> 01:44:35.573]  Do me a favor, tell whoever that is talking to be quiet for me, Joe.
[01:44:36.673 --> 01:44:37.254]  Okay?
[01:44:37.294 --> 01:44:37.594]  Go ahead.
[01:44:37.614 --> 01:44:44.517]  Yeah, I was reading your concentration camp archive at your site, how they have plans to evacuate all the cities.
[01:44:45.637 --> 01:44:49.379]  Is there a chance that what happened in Bhopat, Cambodia will happen here?
[01:44:50.325 --> 01:44:50.846]  Well, of course.
[01:44:50.866 --> 01:44:54.512]  They're setting up for that, and they're building mass evacuation centers.
[01:44:54.552 --> 01:44:56.555]  Paul, what do the Times of London call yours?
[01:44:57.116 --> 01:44:58.699]  Rest and relocation centers?
[01:44:59.542 --> 01:45:10.505]  Yeah, they're called Rest and Relocation Centers, and they've already announced that they're going to set up these mass morgues within giant tents in fields after this staged biological attack.
[01:45:11.066 --> 01:45:26.770]  I mean, we've got an entire archive on Prison Planet and on InfoWars whereby these camps are already set up, or have been for years, and they're just preparing to release the biologicals, as was predicted by the Dark Winter Project, which came out before September 11th.
[01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:28.711]  Gary Hart and Warren Rudman again.
[01:45:29.532 --> 01:45:32.566]  Yeah, and even a few months ago Gary Hart was saying that...
[01:45:34.264 --> 01:45:46.992]  All these, you know, Tennessee, all these different cities and states would be hit by biologicals, and he was involved in the initial project, which put forth that scenario, so we can see the same people behind it.
[01:45:47.553 --> 01:45:49.294]  Yeah, does that answer your question, Joe?
[01:45:49.754 --> 01:45:54.737]  Yeah, and they also, they don't have to, they could just see right through your walls to locate you inside your house.
[01:45:54.777 --> 01:45:55.878]  They don't have to go inside.
[01:45:56.058 --> 01:46:01.862]  Yeah, that's the ground penetrating radar given by the Defense Department to big police departments five years ago.
[01:46:02.535 --> 01:46:03.576]  Now announcing the news.
[01:46:03.616 --> 01:46:04.196]  Thanks for the call.
[01:46:04.236 --> 01:46:05.357]  Appreciate it.
[01:46:05.497 --> 01:46:06.958]  Let's talk to Alan in Texas.
[01:46:07.058 --> 01:46:07.638]  Alan, go ahead.
[01:46:07.658 --> 01:46:08.219]  You're on the air.
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:10.960]  Real quick.
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:12.001]  One thing real quick.
[01:46:12.041 --> 01:46:19.725]  I heard on the public radio this morning that 18% of the population have turned off their TVs and the networks are freaking out.
[01:46:19.785 --> 01:46:21.767]  They can't figure out what they're going to do to get them back.
[01:46:22.087 --> 01:46:23.067]  Yeah, I can't handle it.
[01:46:23.107 --> 01:46:29.852]  For some reason, I watched the last hour of Red October on cable last week.
[01:46:30.272 --> 01:46:30.292]  I...
[01:46:31.229 --> 01:46:33.871]  Well, people will call me about a local newscast.
[01:46:34.031 --> 01:46:36.573]  I will go read the synopsis on their website.
[01:46:37.294 --> 01:46:39.516]  For some reason, I can't stand watching it.
[01:46:39.556 --> 01:46:41.117]  Well, they're figuring out it's garbage.
[01:46:41.197 --> 01:46:45.340]  But what I was really calling to ask you, I really need some information here.
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:50.384]  I was bitching and moaning one time, and this guy said, Well, Alan, what are you going to do about it?
[01:46:51.145 --> 01:46:57.430]  Now, about all these cameras that are going up, do you know who, what agency?
[01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:58.211]  Are they state?
[01:46:58.291 --> 01:46:59.011]  Are they local?
[01:46:59.051 --> 01:46:59.732]  Are they federal?
[01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:02.852]  You know what agencies are putting them up?
[01:47:03.472 --> 01:47:04.813]  Who's paying for them?
[01:47:06.455 --> 01:47:06.835]  Yes.
[01:47:07.055 --> 01:47:08.396]  That's our tax money, isn't it?
[01:47:08.977 --> 01:47:11.419]  Yes, the Federal Department of Transportation.
[01:47:11.619 --> 01:47:13.600]  The Federal Department of Transportation.
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:17.563]  So what we can do about it, nobody's happy with these things.
[01:47:17.923 --> 01:47:20.045]  If they're happy with those cameras, they're bonkers.
[01:47:20.886 --> 01:47:24.989]  And the feedback I get from anyone I talk to, they don't like the cameras.
[01:47:25.609 --> 01:47:29.032]  So we need to hit our federal congressmen, right?
[01:47:30.431 --> 01:47:30.731]  Yes.
[01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:35.714]  We need to let them know that this is an issue, that we don't like it, and we're not going to support people that support those.
[01:47:36.134 --> 01:47:39.976]  We do have hope to have these removed, but we've got to create a national movement to do it.
[01:47:40.956 --> 01:47:42.977]  But it does help to call Congress to write letters.
[01:47:43.437 --> 01:47:44.358]  This is how it works.
[01:47:44.878 --> 01:47:53.842]  Whether it's your police, or it's the cameras, or it's the CPS getting all the federal funding, they send the money in, set the parameters for how it's spent,
[01:47:54.634 --> 01:48:00.036]  And so if they're on a federal highway or a road that takes federal money, it's a federal camera.
[01:48:00.316 --> 01:48:00.697]  Right, okay.
[01:48:00.717 --> 01:48:10.320]  If it's a state highway, part of it's federal, mandated, that we'll give you X amount of billion dollars, you've got to put in X amount of cameras, then the cities also get those federal dollars.
[01:48:10.681 --> 01:48:19.964]  The city buses in Austin have over a dozen cameras per bus with cameras on the buses pointing outwards as they drive as well.
[01:48:20.665 --> 01:48:21.085]  And again...
[01:48:22.077 --> 01:48:24.118]  You've got to protest Capital Metro.
[01:48:24.138 --> 01:48:25.339]  You've got to boycott that.
[01:48:25.619 --> 01:48:26.800]  But notice what they're doing.
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:30.843]  They're just going ahead at breakneck speed with a thousand more in Austin.
[01:48:31.223 --> 01:48:35.826]  Okay, so it's time for the... It's probably illegal to shoot those things.
[01:48:35.866 --> 01:48:42.511]  It's probably time to form the No More Cameras Club and start developing that political push, right?
[01:48:44.017 --> 01:48:48.858]  Yes, and you should go out and watch them as they rotate off the highway and aim into your neighborhoods.
[01:48:48.958 --> 01:48:52.379]  And these are admittedly tied into the federal government.
[01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:55.320]  Okay, well, you answered my question.
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:55.880]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.240]  Hey, I appreciate it.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.781]  I mean, you know, it's like all this.
[01:48:58.841 --> 01:49:00.661]  It's like thumb scanners in the classrooms.
[01:49:01.321 --> 01:49:05.802]  You know, parents locally have to refuse that federal funding or pull their children out.
[01:49:05.822 --> 01:49:06.923]  Paul Watson, comments?
[01:49:07.543 --> 01:49:11.864]  Well, yeah, and that is a major plank to join the fight because...
[01:49:13.388 --> 01:49:21.531]  In a year or two's time, you'll have a situation that we've got in this country whereby you've got 2.5 million, 3 million cameras, but not just cameras.
[01:49:21.571 --> 01:49:32.994]  You've got actual telescreens that are stationed in parking lots, and they scream at people if they, for example, park in a disabled parking space.
[01:49:33.054 --> 01:49:37.115]  And so that's a system that's coming down even more so than in America.
[01:49:37.455 --> 01:49:40.076]  These are intelligent computers with computer voices.
[01:49:40.768 --> 01:49:43.369]  That was the BBC two weeks ago shouting at you.
[01:49:44.249 --> 01:49:48.569]  Now, I've got an article today, they're going to make you answer your phone with a special emergency ring.
[01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:50.130]  If you don't, you'll be fined.
[01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:53.670]  I mean, folks, it's 1984.
[01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:59.532]  Yeah, Paul, you've got over three million cameras in your country now.
[01:50:02.212 --> 01:50:04.473]  And now they've got behavior software, don't they?
[01:50:05.133 --> 01:50:06.733]  Yeah, and that's going into all the airports.
[01:50:08.815 --> 01:50:10.396]  That watches how you walk.
[01:50:11.017 --> 01:50:11.978]  We have to question you.
[01:50:12.018 --> 01:50:13.319]  You weren't walking properly.
[01:50:13.499 --> 01:50:14.060]  Folks!
[01:50:15.421 --> 01:50:18.143]  But yeah, Alan, there's more of us than there are of them.
[01:50:18.163 --> 01:50:19.404]  We've got to start speaking out now.
[01:50:19.424 --> 01:50:19.965]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:22.083 --> 01:50:25.986]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:26.226 --> 01:50:31.651]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:50:31.931 --> 01:50:42.299]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:50:42.459 --> 01:50:46.803]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:50:46.983 --> 01:50:55.406]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:50:55.606 --> 01:51:01.988]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:02.088 --> 01:51:06.570]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:10.996]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:51:11.256 --> 01:51:15.822]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:15.862 --> 01:51:16.102]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:22.555 --> 01:51:29.943]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:51:30.203 --> 01:51:34.948]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:51:35.169 --> 01:51:40.815]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:51:41.055 --> 01:51:45.599]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:51:45.799 --> 01:51:52.965]  The cashless society control grid, inflatable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:51:53.125 --> 01:51:57.528]  oil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:51:57.668 --> 01:52:00.210]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:52:00.411 --> 01:52:07.136]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:52:07.356 --> 01:52:12.626]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:52:12.646 --> 01:52:13.047]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:52:22.247 --> 01:52:24.949]  Are you having problems with the high cost of prescription medications?
[01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:25.530]  Who isn't?
[01:52:25.730 --> 01:52:26.951]  Perhaps it's privacy issues.
[01:52:27.091 --> 01:52:31.275]  Either way, grab a pen and write this number down.
[01:52:31.295 --> 01:52:38.461]  1-800-615-7094 That's 1-800-615-7094 That's a toll free call that will lead you to the online pharmacy.
[01:52:38.542 --> 01:52:41.884]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name brand medications.
[01:52:41.985 --> 01:52:45.788]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[01:52:45.968 --> 01:52:47.490]  All without having to go to the doctor's office.
[01:53:04.665 --> 01:53:04.985]  That's 1-800-615-7094.
[01:53:05.005 --> 01:53:05.245]  Don't wait.
[01:53:05.265 --> 01:53:05.665]  Do it today.
[01:53:38.571 --> 01:53:40.572]  Well, you know, I enjoy taking calls.
[01:53:40.612 --> 01:53:42.533]  The callers have raised a lot of really good points.
[01:53:43.514 --> 01:53:46.595]  But I tend to not get to as much news when we do have a lot of calls.
[01:53:46.675 --> 01:53:48.736]  But we'll continue with the calls.
[01:53:48.816 --> 01:53:51.638]  And I guess this is our final segment with Paul Watson.
[01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:53.519]  We'll come back with news and more calls in the third hour.
[01:53:53.539 --> 01:53:54.920]  Unless Paul wants to keep riding shotgun.
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:55.780]  I love his company.
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:57.741]  He's got a great memory and great insight.
[01:53:58.421 --> 01:53:59.062]  Let's talk to...
[01:54:00.495 --> 01:54:02.195]  I believe it's Maddie in Ohio.
[01:54:02.295 --> 01:54:06.456]  Maddie, go ahead, and then Jerry and John and Brett and others.
[01:54:06.496 --> 01:54:06.836]  Go ahead.
[01:54:06.856 --> 01:54:07.476]  You're on the air.
[01:54:07.496 --> 01:54:08.056]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:08.076 --> 01:54:08.596]  How's it going?
[01:54:08.856 --> 01:54:09.477]  Fantastic.
[01:54:09.757 --> 01:54:10.037]  Good.
[01:54:10.097 --> 01:54:18.398]  Listen, I got your videos, and I just wanted to know if I could get your permission to rent some halls here and just start playing your videos for hundreds of people.
[01:54:19.398 --> 01:54:19.958]  Yeah, do it.
[01:54:19.998 --> 01:54:20.459]  Go ahead.
[01:54:21.199 --> 01:54:28.480]  Okay, because I'm tired of this, and I figure if we don't do something soon, we're all going to end up in concentration camps, and I don't want to be there.
[01:54:28.908 --> 01:54:30.089]  You know, I definitely don't.
[01:54:30.429 --> 01:54:34.552]  Well, they're certainly building the camps right now, and if we cower in fear, it's over.
[01:54:34.572 --> 01:54:35.653]  I know.
[01:54:35.693 --> 01:54:40.016]  Well, I was told if I'm going to do something, don't be afraid.
[01:54:40.056 --> 01:54:44.579]  So I'm going to die fighting, and you stick in there and keep on doing what you're doing.
[01:54:45.199 --> 01:54:54.646]  Well, Maddie, if you do rent halls and put out flyers and get on local talk shows, a big crowd will show up, and you can tell them to go out and inform others.
[01:54:55.447 --> 01:54:56.467]  That's what the plan is.
[01:54:56.908 --> 01:55:03.330]  That's definitely what the plan is, because I'm sick of these black helicopters flying over my neighborhoods, waking me up in the middle of the night, you know?
[01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:05.431]  Yeah, the black helicopters that don't exist.
[01:55:05.751 --> 01:55:06.632]  Right, they don't exist.
[01:55:06.792 --> 01:55:09.613]  But, you know, I would like to have one, and I'd like to fly it over them.
[01:55:11.534 --> 01:55:21.197]  Well, look, a lot of times it's just military maneuvers, but if it's a black helicopter flying over each neighborhood day after day in a grid, it's videotaping the inside of your house.
[01:55:21.718 --> 01:55:22.918]  That's not a free society.
[01:55:22.978 --> 01:55:23.858]  Thanks for the call, Maddie.
[01:55:24.759 --> 01:55:25.039]  Go ahead.
[01:55:26.024 --> 01:55:26.925]  You were going to say something else?
[01:55:30.067 --> 01:55:31.348]  You were going to say something else, Matty?
[01:55:32.589 --> 01:55:33.349]  Okay, she's gone.
[01:55:34.270 --> 01:55:37.212]  Let's talk now to... Who's up next, Mark?
[01:55:41.055 --> 01:55:43.377]  All right, Jerry in Colorado.
[01:55:43.417 --> 01:55:45.178]  Go ahead, Jerry, you're on the air.
[01:55:45.258 --> 01:55:51.063]  Hey, I just wanted to let you guys know, first off, we are moving forward with you guys out here in Colorado.
[01:55:51.963 --> 01:55:53.644]  And I didn't call about the...
[01:55:54.745 --> 01:55:55.806]  I think we're good to go.
[01:55:55.846 --> 01:55:56.747]  We're good to go.
[01:56:22.210 --> 01:56:24.731]  Well, I heard about the telemarketers are threatening an L.A.
[01:56:24.751 --> 01:56:25.131]  Times writer...
[01:56:52.495 --> 01:56:55.996]  Who published the telemarketing center's phone number.
[01:56:57.777 --> 01:57:00.498]  And they said, how dare you give us unsolicited calls?
[01:57:01.258 --> 01:57:02.058]  Yeah, I believe that.
[01:57:02.078 --> 01:57:03.759]  I'm not even saying publish it or anything.
[01:57:03.779 --> 01:57:04.439]  Just have it.
[01:57:04.519 --> 01:57:05.520]  And they hate that whole idea.
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:13.282]  The reason I call real quick is we have a pamphlet out here, which the title of it is Checkpoints Violate Your Rights.
[01:57:13.962 --> 01:57:17.564]  And we would like to give a free one to every person who sends us an SASE.
[01:57:17.584 --> 01:57:18.244]  Can we do that?
[01:57:18.965 --> 01:57:19.946]  I don't know who you are, sir.
[01:57:19.966 --> 01:57:20.366]  I'm sorry.
[01:57:20.426 --> 01:57:21.007]  I can't do that.
[01:57:21.287 --> 01:57:21.627]  Oh, okay.
[01:57:21.687 --> 01:57:22.608]  I don't even know your name.
[01:57:22.648 --> 01:57:23.388]  You just call in.
[01:57:23.729 --> 01:57:25.570]  Can I give you my full name and everything?
[01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:26.230]  Pardon me?
[01:57:26.551 --> 01:57:28.412]  Can I give you my full name and address and everything?
[01:57:28.892 --> 01:57:31.154]  You know, if I let you do that, I did that a few years ago.
[01:57:31.174 --> 01:57:33.376]  People would call in and try to sell trackers on the air.
[01:57:33.416 --> 01:57:37.999]  Just put up a website, sir, and then I let folks plug websites, okay?
[01:57:38.119 --> 01:57:39.961]  Totally free.
[01:57:39.981 --> 01:57:40.981]  I don't know who you are, sir.
[01:57:41.562 --> 01:57:43.003]  Can I write you a letter and tell you all about it?
[01:57:43.143 --> 01:57:43.403]  Sure.
[01:57:43.423 --> 01:57:44.604]  Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:57:44.684 --> 01:57:45.585]  I'd have you on as a guest.
[01:57:46.559 --> 01:57:46.939]  Thank you.
[01:57:47.339 --> 01:57:48.140]  I really appreciate it.
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.421]  I'm not trying to be persnickety.
[01:57:50.081 --> 01:57:51.221]  Take a walk in my shoes.
[01:57:51.842 --> 01:57:54.923]  Paul, you want to stay with us and take some more calls, or do you need to punch out?
[01:57:55.584 --> 01:57:56.964]  I can stay as long as you want, Alex.
[01:57:57.325 --> 01:58:05.029]  Okay, let's just have you ride shotgun with us, and we're going to come back and talk to a couple other callers, and then I'm going to go back into news, because we need to cover some other important issues.
[01:58:05.649 --> 01:58:07.070]  We'll go back into more of your calls.
[01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:09.371]  Third hour of this broadcast coming up.
[01:58:12.213 --> 01:58:13.394]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:13.414 --> 01:58:14.674]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:58:40.999 --> 01:58:42.100]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:43.560]  You want answers?
[01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:45.221]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:45.241 --> 01:58:49.522]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:50.083 --> 01:58:54.184]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:59:02.107 --> 01:59:02.847]  All right, folks.
[01:59:02.907 --> 01:59:06.949]  We try to talk about real issues that actually affect you and your family on this show.
[01:59:06.989 --> 01:59:09.470]  We talk about the tyranny that's growing all around us.
[01:59:10.896 --> 01:59:17.219]  About having the courage, the moral courage to stand against it, to speak out against it, and to know that you have liberties and freedoms.
[01:59:17.999 --> 01:59:22.240]  And understand, if you go along with tyranny, it'll feed on everybody, even those that have served it.
[01:59:22.601 --> 01:59:24.661]  If you stand against it, you will have liberty.
[01:59:25.282 --> 01:59:31.584]  So the safe course, the safer course, is standing up, being bold, being focused, being out in the open.
[01:59:32.464 --> 01:59:32.925]  Coming up, CIA...
[01:59:34.542 --> 01:59:37.124]  Finds no evidence Hussein sought to arm terrorists.
[01:59:37.144 --> 01:59:37.685]  That's coming up.
[01:59:37.805 --> 01:59:38.005]  U.S.
[01:59:38.065 --> 01:59:41.388]  agrees to international control of its troops in Iraq.
[01:59:42.569 --> 01:59:54.058]  Also, we're going to get into the fact that they're covering up the 9-11 evidence and excising it, redacting it, the information the White House is giving to the Whitewash Committee.
[01:59:55.073 --> 01:59:58.859]  More on the helicopter crash that killed a bunch of U.S.
[01:59:58.939 --> 01:59:59.460]  troops, too.
[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:00.341]  Helicopters colliding.
[02:00:00.361 --> 02:00:01.643]  Looks like they were fired upon.
[02:00:02.083 --> 02:00:04.607]  World Bank okays Caspian Pipeline financing.
[02:00:04.967 --> 02:00:07.110]  Speaking of cameras, I've got some of the different...
[02:00:08.615 --> 02:00:10.236]  Let's go back to calls.
[02:00:10.316 --> 02:00:12.818]  Brett in Washington, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:00:12.858 --> 02:00:13.178]  Go ahead.
[02:00:34.614 --> 02:00:35.374]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:00:35.795 --> 02:00:36.235]  Pretty good.
[02:00:36.255 --> 02:00:37.495]  Sounds like you're driving a truck.
[02:00:37.976 --> 02:00:39.076]  Yeah, I'm a truck driver.
[02:00:40.597 --> 02:00:43.038]  I'm a truck driver slash preacher, what do you think?
[02:00:44.298 --> 02:00:48.100]  See, I just guessed with that loud noise that it was an 18-wheeler.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:52.722]  No, I've learned the sound of somebody in an 18-wheeler versus a car.
[02:00:53.262 --> 02:00:56.664]  Yeah, well, you're catching me grinding through the gears right now.
[02:00:57.844 --> 02:00:58.224]  Welcome.
[02:00:58.244 --> 02:00:58.825]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:58.845 --> 02:00:59.505]  What's on your mind?
[02:00:59.565 --> 02:01:00.886]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call.
[02:01:02.358 --> 02:01:06.401]  A couple statements, but before I get to that, I have a real quick question.
[02:01:06.982 --> 02:01:08.303]  William Cooper, you know him?
[02:01:09.203 --> 02:01:12.186]  Well, he was murdered by a SWAT team a year and a half ago.
[02:01:12.626 --> 02:01:13.627]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:01:13.907 --> 02:01:14.508]  Is that right?
[02:01:14.528 --> 02:01:15.428]  I did not know that.
[02:01:16.549 --> 02:01:20.052]  Yeah, they killed him at his house in Arizona.
[02:01:20.072 --> 02:01:20.692]  St.
[02:01:20.712 --> 02:01:21.773]  John's, Arizona.
[02:01:23.154 --> 02:01:23.835]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:01:23.975 --> 02:01:25.096]  Boy, that's... Wow.
[02:01:25.396 --> 02:01:26.257]  I did not know that.
[02:01:27.138 --> 02:01:28.338]  You know, I used to listen to him...
[02:01:30.596 --> 02:01:31.657]  Richard Palmquist.
[02:01:32.297 --> 02:01:38.343]  I guess he was a station owner out there in Delano, California, near Fresno.
[02:01:38.763 --> 02:01:39.864]  Yeah, in Fresno, yes.
[02:01:40.024 --> 02:01:45.549]  Yeah, used to run KDNO, Truth Radio, 98.5.
[02:01:45.609 --> 02:01:46.310]  He got rid of that.
[02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:48.772]  I used to listen to him, William Cooper.
[02:01:48.792 --> 02:01:52.795]  I used to listen to his show, The Hour of the Time, back in the early, mid-90s.
[02:01:52.816 --> 02:01:52.916]  Okay.
[02:01:54.893 --> 02:01:57.554]  Anyway, I was just wondering if he was around.
[02:01:57.674 --> 02:01:58.814]  Yeah, he's dead.
[02:01:59.314 --> 02:02:00.535]  Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[02:02:00.635 --> 02:02:02.535]  A SWAT team came and killed him and his dog.
[02:02:03.195 --> 02:02:03.935]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:02:04.456 --> 02:02:05.116]  Was he married?
[02:02:06.136 --> 02:02:06.676]  Yes, he was.
[02:02:06.736 --> 02:02:07.736]  His family wasn't there.
[02:02:09.417 --> 02:02:09.937]  Oh, wow.
[02:02:11.737 --> 02:02:13.298]  Okay, well, that's too bad.
[02:02:13.318 --> 02:02:14.578]  Okay, that was your question.
[02:02:14.598 --> 02:02:16.319]  I wanted to make a comment about Princess Di.
[02:02:22.628 --> 02:02:23.369]  Princess Diana?
[02:02:23.609 --> 02:02:25.571]  Yes, we have an expert on right now about that.
[02:02:26.051 --> 02:02:27.212]  Okay.
[02:02:27.292 --> 02:02:35.981]  You know, I'm kind of wondering if the upper royal hierarchy had something to do with that, because I guess she was involved with a Muslim, is that right?
[02:02:36.201 --> 02:02:38.943]  Yeah, she was pregnant, and we know they had her killed.
[02:02:39.424 --> 02:02:44.729]  And I'm going to go ahead and let you go, listen after the break, and Paul Watson will recap what happened to Princess Di, okay?
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:46.661]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:46.701 --> 02:02:55.830]  And then we're going to cover news for about 20 minutes or so, then we'll open the phones back up if you want to join us at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:57.031 --> 02:02:59.033]  Big news blitz when we get back after this break.
[02:02:59.934 --> 02:03:02.437]  Paul, the evidence is pretty clear on Princess Diana, is it not?
[02:03:03.177 --> 02:03:09.584]  Yeah, I mean, we had an interview probably about three weeks ago, and it's still posted on the main page of Prison Planet.
[02:03:10.254 --> 02:03:11.596]  We'll be right back.
[02:03:11.716 --> 02:03:12.156]  Stay with us.
[02:03:33.126 --> 02:03:37.472]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:03:37.652 --> 02:03:42.058]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:03:42.239 --> 02:03:46.585]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:03:46.645 --> 02:03:47.986]  The New World Order.
[02:03:49.772 --> 02:03:53.994]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:54.054 --> 02:04:00.976]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:04:01.116 --> 02:04:03.137]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:04:03.497 --> 02:04:06.558]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[02:04:06.738 --> 02:04:13.820]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:19.461]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:05:26.637 --> 02:05:27.757]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:05:33.302 --> 02:05:36.004]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:02.005]  A quick process with the physicians at the online pharmacy and you can have your medications delivered right to your door.
[02:06:02.185 --> 02:06:09.511]  It's quick, it's easy, and it saves you money on popular name brand medications like diet pills and muscle relaxers or painkillers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[02:06:09.551 --> 02:06:15.517]  You'll save money on anti-anxiety medications, heartburn relief, or allergy control all without having to go to the doctor's office.
[02:06:15.677 --> 02:06:18.699]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:06:18.819 --> 02:06:19.960]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:58.721 --> 02:07:02.242]  You know, we're having some interesting radio during the breaks today.
[02:07:02.262 --> 02:07:05.383]  I've been talking to Mark, who's running the show, about deer hunting.
[02:07:06.324 --> 02:07:11.525]  We've done kind of a nature show, a hunting show, off air today.
[02:07:11.585 --> 02:07:12.886]  It's been an interesting discussion.
[02:07:13.715 --> 02:07:15.157]  That'd be more interesting than what's been on air.
[02:07:15.237 --> 02:07:23.168]  No, we've been talking about the real world and how serious things are, and we're not just here putting out negative information, as some say.
[02:07:23.529 --> 02:07:30.559]  We're trying to expose something that is covered up or is put out there piecemeal by the media to condition you.
[02:07:31.582 --> 02:07:34.564]  And, Paul, that's a tactic, isn't it, by the globalists?
[02:07:34.604 --> 02:07:39.348]  And secondarily, isn't it in itself positive to admit the problems?
[02:07:39.668 --> 02:07:43.751]  Isn't that part of the battle, at least people knowing that they're under attack?
[02:07:44.841 --> 02:07:55.611]  Yeah, well, you find that most people who labour the point, you know, what can we do about it, those particular people aren't even doing anything about it themselves.
[02:07:55.671 --> 02:07:57.673]  So, I mean, that's what leads them to say that.
[02:07:58.133 --> 02:08:04.359]  But they do put out so many lies that we pick up on where sometimes you get to the point where you think,
[02:08:05.733 --> 02:08:09.677]  I know all the lies, and yet, am I any nearer to the truth?
[02:08:09.757 --> 02:08:18.046]  So it is that kind of disappointment factor that they try and inoculate into people, whereby they put out every horror that they do.
[02:08:18.306 --> 02:08:23.992]  So everyone knows about it, but nobody knows what's really going on, because it's just a smokescreen of lies.
[02:08:25.223 --> 02:08:28.204]  And I think overall the call from Alan was positive.
[02:08:28.284 --> 02:08:30.425]  What do we do to get these cameras out of here?
[02:08:30.445 --> 02:08:32.045]  You know, who's putting them up?
[02:08:32.085 --> 02:08:39.947]  And our answer, the Department of Transportation, federally, through the state, through mandates, they'll give them half the money and then make the state pay for the other half.
[02:08:40.367 --> 02:08:42.788]  Or, quote, you don't get your other highway funds.
[02:08:43.108 --> 02:08:45.149]  Well, that's not free federal money.
[02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:49.970]  That came from the states, from the people, and is sent back with strings of tax.
[02:08:51.030 --> 02:09:03.213]  It is social engineering, and we've got to get the general public to get as knowledgeable about social engineering, which is more important in your life than being knowledgeable about football.
[02:09:03.653 --> 02:09:20.196]  And it's not that we hate football, it's that we hate the fact that people get so upset about sports, know all the inane pablum and statistics, but don't know what the Fourth or Fifth Amendment is, or how many continents there are, or that Saddam Hussein is a known government agent.
[02:09:20.928 --> 02:09:34.514]  Well, and you've made the point many times, Alex, that you can go into any bar and find some fat, bloated guy that knows every single statistic about the football spanning, like, 50, 60 years, but knows nothing about their rights.
[02:09:34.574 --> 02:09:37.355]  So at least we know that the potential is there.
[02:09:37.495 --> 02:09:41.337]  Everyone has their own brain and only uses, you know, 25% of it, as they say.
[02:09:42.657 --> 02:09:49.140]  All we have to do is put the right information in there and then we can get people caring about freedom rather than football.
[02:09:50.327 --> 02:09:51.088]  Well, that's it.
[02:09:52.250 --> 02:09:53.531]  It's like 1984.
[02:09:53.611 --> 02:09:55.934]  They control the population with the lottery.
[02:09:56.835 --> 02:09:58.578]  It's a tool for the proletariat.
[02:09:58.598 --> 02:10:01.862]  I mean, it's all the same systems of control today.
[02:10:02.737 --> 02:10:13.539]  And even people that, I mean, there have been big studies that have come out in Germany whereby they select a family and they say you can't watch television for three weeks.
[02:10:13.619 --> 02:10:17.200]  And that family, in some cases, it's like an addiction.
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:23.441]  They have to turn it on, even though the prize of not watching it for three straight weeks is like $10,000 or whatever.
[02:10:23.821 --> 02:10:29.222]  But people who have switched off the television for three weeks notice a remarkable difference in the way...
[02:10:29.722 --> 02:10:33.024]  Well, I hate watching TV and I feel guilty that I don't to monitor them, Paul.
[02:10:33.044 --> 02:10:33.765]  What's happened to me?
[02:10:33.785 --> 02:10:37.787]  I mean, just in the last three months, I don't watch TV anymore.
[02:10:54.358 --> 02:11:03.922]  Well, same with my... In my case, I mean, watching television for me just makes me furiously angry because the lies are blatant and you know that millions of people are watching it.
[02:11:04.902 --> 02:11:23.729]  And it is possible to read the same lies in a, you know, just a text format online with all the articles and deal with it and then analyse it, but when it's in your face via the television with all these pre-selected, scripted reports and the sheened newscasters that present them, then that does make a person angry.
[02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:32.058]  Yeah, some number 10 blonde licking her lips, smiling, selling us death of our culture, death of humanity.
[02:11:32.238 --> 02:11:35.161]  The globalists have killed 200 million people last century.
[02:11:35.341 --> 02:11:42.889]  They're arming every one of the teeth, getting ready for national drafts, carrying out terrorism, putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:11:43.190 --> 02:11:43.950]  I'm angry!
[02:11:44.211 --> 02:11:45.232]  I'm sick of it!
[02:11:46.084 --> 02:11:48.288]  People, this is life and death.
[02:11:48.408 --> 02:11:50.171]  Paul, do you ever just feel like screaming?
[02:11:50.572 --> 02:11:55.300]  I'm so sick of watching these serial killer murderers stand up there as our saviors.
[02:11:56.442 --> 02:11:57.604]  All the time, and that's why...
[02:11:58.553 --> 02:12:20.641]  You probably remember, probably, I think it was just before September 11th, CNN and other major news networks basically sacked a whole plethora of their, you know, old school newscasters, basically middle-aged men, replaced them with these blonde bimbos because they knew that the propaganda was getting more sophisticated and so they needed to get it across to the
[02:12:22.582 --> 02:12:36.348]  And licking their lips when they talk about Bush, our great leader.
[02:12:37.929 --> 02:12:40.270]  So sick, folks.
[02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:41.891]  Just trying to go over this propaganda.
[02:12:41.911 --> 02:12:43.872]  Paul, I got a couple articles here I want to throw out at you.
[02:12:43.912 --> 02:12:45.233]  This is out of the London Independent.
[02:12:46.553 --> 02:12:46.794]  U.S.
[02:12:46.874 --> 02:12:49.515]  agrees to international control over its troops in Iraq.
[02:12:50.623 --> 02:12:56.460]  United States accepts that to avoid humiliating failure in Iraq, it needs to bring its forces quickly under international control.
[02:12:57.688 --> 02:12:59.809]  And speed the handover of power.
[02:13:00.129 --> 02:13:07.591]  Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief, said discussions along these lines will be made in the coming days.
[02:13:07.951 --> 02:13:22.636]  Mr. Solana told the Independent, well, I said six months before the war, we're going to go in, we're going to get pinned down, we're going to win the major takeover, lose the war, the UN will come in as the savior, because I read globalist reports where they said that was the plan.
[02:13:23.156 --> 02:13:26.317]  They go on to say this has already been covertly set up with Bush.
[02:13:26.357 --> 02:13:27.317]  Comments, Paul Watson.
[02:13:28.115 --> 02:13:31.159]  Well, yeah, we were talking about the bombings last time around.
[02:13:31.199 --> 02:13:33.501]  We were saying, well, why are these bombings taking place?
[02:13:33.561 --> 02:13:35.483]  Why are some of them being allowed to take place?
[02:13:35.523 --> 02:13:44.734]  And we commented that, you know, it would be the pretext for international control, UN, EU control of the occupation of Iraq, and that's exactly what happened.
[02:13:45.254 --> 02:13:45.795]  And people...
[02:13:46.858 --> 02:13:50.382]  Trying to place a portion of blame onto who's behind these bombings.
[02:13:50.482 --> 02:14:05.437]  Obviously the mainstream line is, oh, it's Al-Qaeda coming across when before the war even MI5 admitted that they were being told to link Saddam with Al-Qaeda when in fact Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda are basically two opposing views.
[02:14:05.477 --> 02:14:07.279]  They hated each other basically.
[02:14:07.919 --> 02:14:25.335]  And then we get all these bombings and people don't realize that although Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi Republican Guard were paid off to leave the country to Belarus and other Eastern European countries, which was reported in the mainstream media in April of this year,
[02:14:26.144 --> 02:14:30.306]  People don't realize that there are still some remnants of that original Iraqi army.
[02:14:30.346 --> 02:14:32.047]  I mean, they didn't just disappear.
[02:14:32.067 --> 02:14:38.730]  So, obviously, part of these bombings is due to those remnants, and part of it is staged events involving CIA.
[02:14:38.970 --> 02:14:45.593]  Yeah, well, a lot of the smaller events is different portions infighting with each other for control after we leave.
[02:14:45.673 --> 02:14:53.537]  But to add something here, you see, what happens is we go in, our troops are ordered, bulldoze the fruit trees, kill peasants.
[02:14:54.295 --> 02:14:54.916]  We're good to go.
[02:15:13.041 --> 02:15:13.601]  We're good to go.
[02:15:38.408 --> 02:15:40.389]  Oh, yeah, and then you've got U.S.
[02:15:40.489 --> 02:15:44.031]  soldiers being ordered to tie up Iraqi children.
[02:15:44.071 --> 02:15:52.035]  You've got Iraqis selling alcohol, being hooded and taken to prison camps, which are basically, you know, rivaled Guantanamo Bay.
[02:15:52.295 --> 02:15:53.355]  That's Associated Press.
[02:15:53.595 --> 02:16:00.199]  If you sell anything without an RFID bracelet on, saying you work for Halliburton, you're arrested and put in a camp.
[02:16:00.239 --> 02:16:00.619]  Go ahead.
[02:16:01.368 --> 02:16:08.690]  Yeah, you've got ID cards being issued for anyone, any Iraqi that wants to leave the immediate area.
[02:16:08.770 --> 02:16:11.551]  I mean, every single Iraqi's been disarmed.
[02:16:12.051 --> 02:16:15.071]  You've got... And Baghdad's a city of five million.
[02:16:15.371 --> 02:16:16.492]  The other cities are big, too.
[02:16:16.512 --> 02:16:18.252]  This is great training for your troops.
[02:16:19.132 --> 02:16:25.654]  And then you've got, I mean, the Red Cross being bombed, which we know has been linked to communists in the past in the UN, but...
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:36.470]  That is supposed to be helping the Iraqis, the Red Cross, with a humanitarian effort, but then that gets bombed, and you ask, well, if the Iraqis are being helped by the Red Cross, why would they bomb it?
[02:16:36.791 --> 02:16:41.976]  And then the Red Cross, immediately after their complex gets bombed, they move out of the country.
[02:16:43.318 --> 02:16:45.460]  And then ask for a bunch of money.
[02:16:47.910 --> 02:17:02.026]  Yeah, and all the reconstruction contracts after all these bridges and complexes get bombed go to, surprise, surprise, Halliburton, Bechtel all have close links to the neocons and the Bush administration.
[02:17:02.046 --> 02:17:02.927]  And here's another one.
[02:17:03.127 --> 02:17:04.308]  This is the Washington Post.
[02:17:04.348 --> 02:17:07.532]  CIA finds no evidence Hussein sought to arm terrorists.
[02:17:08.112 --> 02:17:13.518]  They tell you the lie up front, then they admit the lie but say it was an accident to retain some credibility.
[02:17:13.898 --> 02:17:24.849]  The CIA's search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has found no evidence that former President Saddam Hussein tried to transfer chemical or biological technology or weapons to terrorists, according to military and intelligence experts.
[02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:31.076]  And it goes on, Anthony Kordsman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
[02:17:32.181 --> 02:17:47.569]  Provided new details about the weapon search and Iraq insurgency in a report released Friday that was based on briefings over the past two weeks in Iraq from David Kaye, the CIA representative who is directing the search for unconventional weapons in Iraq, L. Paul Bremer, the U.S.
[02:17:47.650 --> 02:17:50.531]  civilian administrator there, and military officials.
[02:17:50.571 --> 02:17:52.032]  But here's the deal, folks.
[02:17:53.465 --> 02:17:55.887]  If they wanted to find weapons, they'd find them.
[02:17:56.067 --> 02:18:04.854]  On purpose, they're not allowed to produce them or manufacture them to, again, make America look bad so the UN can come in as the good cop.
[02:18:05.254 --> 02:18:06.936]  We didn't just come up with this scenario.
[02:18:07.076 --> 02:18:08.537]  I said this over a year ago, Paul.
[02:18:09.605 --> 02:18:14.228]  Yeah, and even MI5 were being ordered before the war to link Saddam with al-Qaeda.
[02:18:14.248 --> 02:18:20.271]  And again, I've got an entire chapter in the book about how these weapons were sold to Saddam by U.S.
[02:18:20.351 --> 02:18:23.813]  government and these same corporations in the late 80s.
[02:18:23.873 --> 02:18:27.736]  So if they wanted to produce them, they would produce them, but they haven't for a reason.
[02:18:28.836 --> 02:18:30.798]  We'll be back with more news and more calls.
[02:18:30.858 --> 02:18:31.358]  Stay with us.
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:36.642]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:18:36.903 --> 02:18:40.405]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[02:18:44.668 --> 02:18:50.832]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:51.232 --> 02:18:59.138]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:18:59.558 --> 02:19:04.900]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.

[02:19:30.451 --> 02:19:31.271]  Protect your family.
[02:19:32.032 --> 02:19:38.237]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:19:38.697 --> 02:19:46.463]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:19:46.823 --> 02:19:52.408]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[02:19:52.668 --> 02:19:53.268]  We're good to go.
[02:20:20.118 --> 02:20:22.679]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[02:22:45.636 --> 02:23:03.850]  All right, John, Elias, Henry, Jess, and others, your calls are coming up straight into the next segment, then back into more news right now with Paul Watson, who's, again, the webmaster of PrisonPlanet.com and has amazing insight on the New World Order.
[02:23:03.891 --> 02:23:05.792]  Our minds are basically one on these issues.
[02:23:05.812 --> 02:23:10.636]  That's why I hired him to be my webmaster, because I found his analysis to be excellent and not kooky.
[02:23:11.718 --> 02:23:16.099]  Or to be part of the little sewing circles like so many of the other patriots out there.
[02:23:17.579 --> 02:23:21.540]  Paul, World Bank okays Caspian Pipeline financing.
[02:23:21.580 --> 02:23:23.881]  That finally went through a few weeks ago.
[02:23:23.941 --> 02:23:24.861]  Now they've made it official.
[02:23:25.421 --> 02:23:37.704]  The World Bank agreed, using our money to provide the money to build the oil pipeline out of the Tajikistan, Uzbekistan area, right through Afghanistan, down through Pakistan, out to the ocean.
[02:23:38.584 --> 02:23:40.645]  Another one of the nice little motives here.
[02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:54.325]  Yeah, even before September 11th, we know that, I mean, we had the report out of the BBC where it was a UN international contact forum involving mainly the European countries and
[02:23:55.265 --> 02:24:04.832]  They basically stated that there needed to be an invasion of Afghanistan during, you know, towards the end of the year, and this report came out in July of 2001.
[02:24:05.432 --> 02:24:10.236]  And troops were... 18,000 British troops, 40,000-plus U.S.
[02:24:10.276 --> 02:24:15.820]  troops were massed, ready to invade, two days before 9-11, and Bush had the launch orders on his desk.
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:23.345]  Yeah, that later came out in NBC News that Bush had these al-Qaeda attack plans on 9th of September.
[02:24:24.165 --> 02:24:24.266]  And...
[02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:36.756]  In June 2002, when everyone was talking about the pipeline, which had been scheduled for many years, we had the Taliban's in Texas report out of the BBC in 97.
[02:24:39.265 --> 02:24:44.686]  The BBC reported actually that it was a conspiracy theory that this pipeline was set to go ahead.
[02:24:45.206 --> 02:24:57.749]  And then in January of 2003, I remember it was a Globe and Mail report saying that all these countries had got together and agreed that the construction of the pipeline would take place imminently.
[02:24:57.789 --> 02:25:01.470]  So again, another conspiracy theory turns out to be true.
[02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:07.431]  And now you've got all these different groups jumping in on who controls it and who gets most of the revenue from it.
[02:25:09.162 --> 02:25:09.883]  Absolutely.
[02:25:10.223 --> 02:25:12.125]  Here's another report.
[02:25:12.225 --> 02:25:14.026]  I talked about telescreens.
[02:25:14.146 --> 02:25:15.307]  You talked about them now.
[02:25:15.387 --> 02:25:17.669]  The cameras have TV screens.
[02:25:18.169 --> 02:25:21.712]  The computer knows how to look at certain activities, scan cars.
[02:25:22.913 --> 02:25:24.174]  They shout orders at you.
[02:25:24.234 --> 02:25:26.376]  It actually says they shout at you meanly.
[02:25:27.417 --> 02:25:30.820]  Now here in the U.S., I've been reporting this for years, your phone will ring.
[02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:32.841]  If you don't answer it, you'll be fined.
[02:25:32.881 --> 02:25:35.804]  It's a special government phone call ring.
[02:25:36.662 --> 02:25:39.344]  And this is out of the Arizona Republic today.
[02:25:39.924 --> 02:25:42.906]  Emergency dial system is starting in January.
[02:25:43.826 --> 02:25:49.109]  An automated dialing system for Maricopa County residents of emergencies goes live in January.
[02:25:49.669 --> 02:25:54.692]  Officials have been working and installing the 2.5 million community emergency notification system for a year.
[02:25:54.792 --> 02:26:03.357]  The system can call up to 2,200 phones a minute, alerting residents of hazardous fires, toxic spills, or even a terrorist attack.
[02:26:03.397 --> 02:26:03.537]  So...
[02:26:04.426 --> 02:26:07.908]  And by law, they want to make all the new TVs, all the new radios.
[02:26:07.948 --> 02:26:13.192]  The FEMA control systems are already in the radio stations and TV stations since 95, excuse me, 97.
[02:26:13.772 --> 02:26:16.113]  Now they're going to make it the law.
[02:26:16.133 --> 02:26:23.878]  I had the FCC guy on a few years ago about this, where you have to answer the phone or you get some criminal charges.
[02:26:24.619 --> 02:26:27.581]  So now we're going to have to answer the phone to get our government messages.
[02:26:27.901 --> 02:26:29.362]  It's for our safety, Paul.
[02:26:30.265 --> 02:26:32.926]  Yeah, and they've actually coined a new term for it.
[02:26:32.946 --> 02:26:36.548]  I mean, everyone knows about biometrics and telemetrics.
[02:26:36.628 --> 02:26:53.915]  Now the new term is behaviour metrics, whereby your behaviour brings up red flags, and that leads to suspicions of terrorist activity, which includes the reports that we had, and this spans back over a year, loitering in train stations and so forth, and people ask...
[02:26:54.455 --> 02:27:00.518]  Well, if they have, you know, in this country, two and a half million, three million CCTV cameras, so what?
[02:27:00.538 --> 02:27:18.085]  I mean, you can't get the same amount of people to watch every screen, which is why they're feeding it all into these centralized databases, which includes the ID card in Britain and things like the Matrix database in America, which has already been announced, to bring up these red flags to centralize the system.
[02:27:18.425 --> 02:27:20.166]  And now I'm looking at an article...
[02:27:20.846 --> 02:27:34.797]  Where they admit that on the highways, not just the cell towers, but these antenna arrays on the cameras are going to scan your RFID chips that Walmart is already going to put in all its products with Homeland Security.
[02:27:34.877 --> 02:27:36.198]  Ooh, Paul, sounds nice.
[02:27:37.222 --> 02:27:50.331]  Yeah, and we've already got the technology whereby these same antennas can scan the radio frequency that you're listening to as you're driving along in your car and then pinpoint directed advertising towards you on the next billboard.
[02:27:50.411 --> 02:27:56.935]  And now, if you go into bars in London, they make you give a DNA cheek swab to go in and drink beer.
[02:27:57.536 --> 02:28:06.942]  Yeah, and if you refuse to submit to that, the article out of the Telegraph said that they've got police on standby to question you because it's suspicious not to take the DNA swab.
[02:28:08.176 --> 02:28:10.857]  And they've said that it's part of a new national DNA database.
[02:28:11.278 --> 02:28:14.419]  Folks, you didn't tune in to a late-night horror science fiction flick.
[02:28:14.759 --> 02:28:16.520]  You tuned in to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:21.942]  We're reading nothing but mainstream, in-your-face pure evil as they destroy the world.
[02:28:23.503 --> 02:28:24.403]  We're on the march.
[02:28:24.904 --> 02:28:26.524]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:28:27.445 --> 02:28:30.126]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:33.314 --> 02:28:37.397]  We've all heard that garlic has been used for centuries to ward off everything from diseases to demons.
[02:28:37.697 --> 02:28:41.260]  What is it about garlic that makes it the most recognized and widely used spice in history?
[02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:42.501]  It's called allicin.
[02:28:42.941 --> 02:28:45.824]  Allicin is the primary active ingredient in fresh crushed garlic.
[02:28:46.164 --> 02:28:51.688]  According to the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry, garlic has only 5,000 micrograms of allicin potential.
[02:28:52.109 --> 02:28:55.291]  Garlamax has only 5,500 micrograms of allicin potential.
[02:28:55.511 --> 02:28:57.473]  But Allimax has 180,000 micrograms of allicin yield guaranteed.
[02:29:00.795 --> 02:29:05.961]  That's why Alamax stands head, shoulders, hips, and ankles above every other garlic product on the market today.
[02:29:06.242 --> 02:29:09.846]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Alamax.
[02:29:10.106 --> 02:29:13.170]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:29:13.530 --> 02:29:18.896]  Garlic is the number one all-natural, antiviral, and antibacterial spice on Earth, and Allison is the reason.
[02:29:19.176 --> 02:29:20.358]  When you need the power of garlic...
[02:29:20.658 --> 02:29:22.080]  You need the power of Alamax.
[02:29:22.321 --> 02:29:22.501]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:29:22.541 --> 02:29:22.802]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:29:22.822 --> 02:29:25.606]  And remember, garlic is Allison, and Allison is Alamax.
[02:29:32.888 --> 02:29:36.771]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:29:37.011 --> 02:29:42.455]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:29:42.715 --> 02:29:53.082]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:29:53.262 --> 02:29:57.605]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:57.785 --> 02:30:06.171]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:30:06.411 --> 02:30:12.775]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:30:12.895 --> 02:30:17.378]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:30:17.599 --> 02:30:21.801]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[02:30:28.446 --> 02:30:31.289]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:30:32.730 --> 02:30:36.714]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[02:30:37.154 --> 02:30:44.200]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.
[02:30:44.581 --> 02:30:52.448]  With an ozone generator, you can kill bacteria and viruses in your drinking water, get rid of that stale air in your house that keeps recirculating,
[02:30:52.848 --> 02:30:57.669]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[02:30:58.150 --> 02:31:02.831]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises for one of the most affordable ozone generators available today.
[02:31:03.231 --> 02:31:04.671]  That number is 800-569-4340.

[02:31:36.593 --> 02:31:37.133]  Don't worry.
[02:31:37.573 --> 02:31:39.093]  This show is documented.
[02:31:39.614 --> 02:31:42.354]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:42.774 --> 02:31:46.295]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:31:46.735 --> 02:31:50.796]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:31:51.356 --> 02:31:55.516]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[02:31:56.076 --> 02:32:01.017]  All right, I've got about ten other really important news stories we'll hit before we end this show.
[02:32:01.117 --> 02:32:04.418]  And we've got John and Elias and Jess and Kelly and many others.
[02:32:05.180 --> 02:32:06.280]  That are patiently holding.
[02:32:06.300 --> 02:32:08.861]  We'll get to your calls quickly as well.
[02:32:08.881 --> 02:32:13.022]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[02:32:14.383 --> 02:32:18.884]  Now, I'm not going to give any specifics out on air, but this is so funny.
[02:32:19.764 --> 02:32:23.965]  And we've talked about it during the break all day today, so I have to talk about it.
[02:32:24.805 --> 02:32:26.246]  And again, we're not going to say any names.
[02:32:27.846 --> 02:32:30.007]  But so many patriots out there
[02:32:31.744 --> 02:32:33.926]  Patriots, conservatives, libertarians, whatever.
[02:32:34.006 --> 02:32:53.460]  They're so busy thinking other patriots are out to get them and there's men in black hiding behind the bushes when the helicopters are openly scanning all of us that I saw a website where the person posted one of these emails from Africa.
[02:32:54.721 --> 02:32:57.083]  Now, anybody that's got emails gotten one of these.
[02:32:58.442 --> 02:33:00.622]  I was talking to Rod that runs the internet for the network.
[02:33:00.662 --> 02:33:05.823]  He says he's gotten a thousand of them at least in the last month.
[02:33:06.063 --> 02:33:11.464]  I get 50 of them a day for at least two years.
[02:33:13.205 --> 02:33:14.525]  Let's bring Paul Watson up.
[02:33:14.585 --> 02:33:18.945]  Paul, I bet you've gotten these emails that say, my country's recently changed the law.
[02:33:20.086 --> 02:33:21.746]  I want to send you $20 million, $5 million.
[02:33:21.766 --> 02:33:22.846]  Just wire me $5,000 and you get the $15 million.
[02:33:28.661 --> 02:33:32.611]  And only greedy pea brains or really stupid people
[02:33:33.374 --> 02:33:34.115]  We're good to go.
[02:34:03.208 --> 02:34:08.431]  And I'm looking at it, and people start responding, man, are you nuts?
[02:34:08.511 --> 02:34:09.671]  We all get those emails.
[02:34:09.711 --> 02:34:10.872]  That's not the government.
[02:34:11.673 --> 02:34:13.754]  That's not the government doing that to you.
[02:34:14.554 --> 02:34:27.221]  But my point is, how can I talk to these patriots who think I'm bad or somebody else is bad when they think emails from Zimbabwe or emails from wherever are the government trying to bribe them?
[02:34:27.321 --> 02:34:29.342]  Let me tell you how the government tries to bribe you.
[02:34:30.142 --> 02:34:31.003]  Hello, this is...
[02:34:32.248 --> 02:34:35.569]  John Doe from one of the biggest syndicators in the country.
[02:34:35.649 --> 02:34:36.549]  I'm sure you've heard of me.
[02:34:36.609 --> 02:34:38.890]  We'd like to meet you at the Four Star Restaurant.
[02:34:39.490 --> 02:34:43.952]  And you get there and they offer you a million bucks to sell out and go work for them.
[02:34:45.592 --> 02:34:51.054]  If you've ever been in this long enough and worked hard enough and affected change enough, maybe that'll happen to you.
[02:34:51.374 --> 02:34:52.874]  If you're a good enough talk show host.
[02:34:53.214 --> 02:34:55.355]  And then it's not like we're here to pay you off.
[02:34:55.455 --> 02:34:57.256]  It's, hey, come join us.
[02:34:57.576 --> 02:34:58.636]  Don't be with those kooks.
[02:34:59.358 --> 02:35:00.418]  Be like Limbaugh.
[02:35:01.479 --> 02:35:03.699]  So I don't know why I'm telling this story.
[02:35:03.759 --> 02:35:18.603]  It's just I see so much of that where, you know, like I've got call waiting at my house, and when I'm on my cordless phone, when somebody calls in, it'll cut out for a second, and I'll talk to friends, and they hear that and go, oh, did you hear that?
[02:35:18.643 --> 02:35:19.583]  They're listening to us.
[02:35:20.043 --> 02:35:22.624]  Folks, if they're listening to you, you don't hear it.
[02:35:22.964 --> 02:35:25.605]  It's all digital now unless they want you to.
[02:35:26.431 --> 02:35:31.355]  All I'm saying is the number one cause of death is driving in your car until you're 55.
[02:35:31.715 --> 02:35:33.136]  Then it's heart attacks and cancer.
[02:35:33.877 --> 02:35:35.458]  You still get in your car, folks.
[02:35:35.558 --> 02:35:37.199]  Chances are it's going to kill you.
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:43.725]  Chances are the statistics are even worse that you'll get really hurt, real bad in your car.
[02:35:43.985 --> 02:35:45.586]  In fact, I've been hurt quite a few times.
[02:35:45.946 --> 02:35:47.948]  I'm still going to get in my car today.
[02:35:49.514 --> 02:35:50.034]  We're good to go.
[02:36:09.724 --> 02:36:12.545]  Folks, they don't have the personnel at Echelon.
[02:36:12.585 --> 02:36:14.446]  They don't have the personnel at NSA.
[02:36:14.466 --> 02:36:17.788]  They don't have the personnel at CIA to do this.
[02:36:18.548 --> 02:36:23.790]  They do have local police units, federally funded, out looking for someone who's a terrorist.
[02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:24.971]  That is true.
[02:36:26.051 --> 02:36:28.492]  Again, you should give those people a copy of my video.
[02:36:28.532 --> 02:36:29.433]  You should wake them up.
[02:36:30.753 --> 02:36:35.175]  Paul, I don't even know why I brought this story up, but I shared it with you on the phone yesterday.
[02:36:35.195 --> 02:36:36.916]  Is it not ridiculous?
[02:36:37.705 --> 02:36:42.907]  Well, it is because, I mean, sometimes the Patriot community are their own worst enemy.
[02:36:42.947 --> 02:36:46.429]  I mean, with this email scam, I mean, it's been going on for years.
[02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:57.634]  In fact, I've just clicked on my email and in the last five minutes I've got one and you can tell that they are these kind of emails by the fact that the email subject line and the sender are all in capital letters.
[02:36:57.694 --> 02:37:06.298]  I mean, you get a subject heading like, please, I need your urgent assistance and it's obviously this offer to transfer millions of dollars into your bank account.
[02:37:06.338 --> 02:37:06.438]  So,
[02:37:07.131 --> 02:37:17.073]  Everybody knows about, it used to be called the Nigerian banking scam, but now they've got a bit more sophisticated and they send them from South Africa and Zimbabwe and other countries.
[02:37:17.573 --> 02:37:19.693]  So again, it has been going on for years.
[02:37:19.833 --> 02:37:21.234]  Everybody gets these emails.
[02:37:21.294 --> 02:37:23.314]  Nobody reads them.
[02:37:23.694 --> 02:37:35.016]  But then you tell the person, hey, this is a scam everybody's got, and they go, no, no, you're just jealous because I'm so powerful they're trying to bribe me.
[02:37:35.774 --> 02:38:03.557]  Well, it's because in the last five years or so, this huge cult of celebrity that's grown, both in America and Britain, and so any chance at elevating one's own self-importance, people normally will fall for that, because the ego is a powerful, seductive thing, and so if people receive this sort of thing, they're more prone to take on this paranoid nature and elevate their own ego to say, oh look, people are trying to bribe me, I'm getting all these emails, and
[02:38:04.057 --> 02:38:06.438]  Everybody gets them, and it's all fake.
[02:38:07.419 --> 02:38:09.019]  Yeah, let's take some calls.
[02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:10.320]  I had to mention that.
[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:12.941]  I mean, when I saw that, I was just rolling.
[02:38:14.722 --> 02:38:17.343]  And then people were telling them, hey, that's not true.
[02:38:17.383 --> 02:38:18.144]  We all get those.
[02:38:19.344 --> 02:38:21.185]  I mean, folks, this is what's wrong with the country.
[02:38:21.686 --> 02:38:24.747]  I just don't understand it sometimes.
[02:38:25.227 --> 02:38:26.428]  I just can't understand it.
[02:38:26.888 --> 02:38:29.549]  We've got massive, real things happening.
[02:38:29.589 --> 02:38:32.971]  Paul, they admit they're putting cancer viruses in a lot of the vaccines.
[02:38:34.096 --> 02:38:40.329]  They're still administering the oral polio vaccine in Austin, which they admit has SV40 in it.
[02:38:40.369 --> 02:38:41.291]  What's SV40, Paul?
[02:38:41.331 --> 02:38:43.535]  Well, that's the cancer.
[02:38:45.789 --> 02:39:08.597]  The same thing being put in potatoes in Britain and other you know produce and so it's the same thing you've got all these horrors going on but people try and find these distractions I mean it's similar to people who argue others you know this big split within the New World Order Russia's fighting Israel and you know America's you know with the Jews but then there's this faction within America that doesn't like the Jews and
[02:39:08.997 --> 02:39:17.407]  It seeks to make the whole thing more interesting when the overall picture is that they are all together and we need to fight them on a universal front.
[02:39:17.787 --> 02:39:18.808]  Well, that's it.
[02:39:18.888 --> 02:39:19.809]  It's not Jews.
[02:39:19.849 --> 02:39:20.791]  It's not Germans.
[02:39:20.851 --> 02:39:21.872]  It's not Chinese.
[02:39:21.952 --> 02:39:28.139]  It's evil people throughout history, regardless of what color they are, need to be resisted.
[02:39:30.511 --> 02:39:31.833]  And I'm trying to bring people together.
[02:39:31.893 --> 02:39:34.016]  I get criticized, Paul, because I bring people together.
[02:39:34.036 --> 02:39:40.326]  Because I'm able to wake leftists up and have them go out and buy guns and become conservatives.
[02:39:40.346 --> 02:39:41.788]  I mean, what's wrong with that, Paul?
[02:39:42.958 --> 02:39:59.444]  Well, the New World Order don't like that, because obviously they've got the leftist control, because the big leftist groups are funded by the Ford Foundation, and then on the other side, the big pro-war rallies were sponsored by Clear Channel, which is, you know, Bush administration background.
[02:39:59.824 --> 02:40:05.926]  Clear Channel, Ford Foundation, it's the same people, so if you try to wake the leftists up to that, then they can't see it.
[02:40:07.506 --> 02:40:08.247]  Absolutely.
[02:40:08.287 --> 02:40:11.668]  Let's talk to John in Florida, then Elias...
[02:40:12.625 --> 02:40:13.366]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:40:13.726 --> 02:40:14.146]  Go ahead.
[02:40:14.406 --> 02:40:17.869]  I'm just calling about the Jensen Beach Pineapple Festival they just had this weekend.
[02:40:18.529 --> 02:40:20.711]  And it was, they had the Little River Band in concert.
[02:40:21.311 --> 02:40:28.816]  And before the concert, the local bank manager, she came out and said that the Little River Band was busy on their tour bus watching their favorite show, Cops.
[02:40:29.617 --> 02:40:35.961]  Then they bring out this guy who's like a local hero, and he helped the police apprehend someone who, quote, wasn't on the right side of the law.
[02:40:36.742 --> 02:40:41.085]  They give him some lucite plaque and tell the audience to give him a round of applause.
[02:40:41.914 --> 02:40:42.775]  And, of course, that was from the local TV.
[02:40:42.835 --> 02:40:43.015]  Yeah.
[02:40:43.055 --> 02:40:43.355]  Oh, yeah.
[02:40:58.709 --> 02:41:02.991]  Yep, it was a stage, like a stage... I mean, I'm asking you, was that on local TV?
[02:41:03.111 --> 02:41:03.551]  Oh, I don't know.
[02:41:03.651 --> 02:41:04.792]  No, I was at the concert myself.
[02:41:04.832 --> 02:41:12.095]  I don't know who... So basically it was all, oh, sorry guys, you can't see the band, they're watching cops, here, let's give awards to Tattletails.
[02:41:12.355 --> 02:41:14.616]  It was all like a worship of the police state thing?
[02:41:14.956 --> 02:41:15.456]  Exactly.
[02:41:15.756 --> 02:41:16.097]  Exactly.
[02:41:16.137 --> 02:41:25.901]  And then, you know, the Little River Band comes out, and they had a bunch of cops in the front, they had security guards, and then they had this guy who was dressed in camo gear with like a black beret.
[02:41:26.559 --> 02:41:28.259]  And he was kind of like running the whole show.
[02:41:28.299 --> 02:41:31.020]  He was running back and forth here and there, pointing people out.
[02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:34.461]  I mean, this is like a local little festival.
[02:41:34.761 --> 02:41:35.561]  You know?
[02:41:35.581 --> 02:41:40.002]  See, that's the message with Bush, with the police state, and Blair, and the rest of it, and Vicente Fox.
[02:41:40.342 --> 02:41:44.423]  If you're powerful, you've got militarized troops around you, see?
[02:41:44.703 --> 02:41:46.843]  So now everyone wants to imitate that.
[02:41:46.943 --> 02:41:48.443]  See the sick culture?
[02:41:48.904 --> 02:41:49.164]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:49.264 --> 02:41:49.944]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:41:50.004 --> 02:41:56.145]  I mean, it was just, you know, you felt like you were some kind of a captive in this little thing.
[02:41:57.057 --> 02:42:01.920]  And like I said, they were pointing people out, and anyone who had a camera, they would grab them and throw them out of the concert.
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:05.822]  Oh, see, yeah, we've got to keep all the terrorists in line.
[02:42:06.183 --> 02:42:06.723]  Right, right.
[02:42:07.083 --> 02:42:08.184]  It was just amazing.
[02:42:08.484 --> 02:42:12.687]  Well, it's like the article out of the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
[02:42:12.707 --> 02:42:17.309]  They're now going after county commissioners in zoning scams with the Patriot Act.
[02:42:17.910 --> 02:42:19.991]  Paul, it's terrorism, isn't it?
[02:42:20.791 --> 02:42:22.893]  Yeah, that's what we were talking about earlier with the...
[02:42:23.689 --> 02:42:28.832]  Oh, look how they brainwash young children to beat people up to be members of the tax police.
[02:42:28.852 --> 02:42:30.073]  They wear black masks.
[02:42:30.554 --> 02:42:31.334]  Oh, it's so good!
[02:42:53.095 --> 02:42:53.716]  Absolutely.
[02:42:54.557 --> 02:42:56.779]  Well, I just wanted to say, too, your movies are great.
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:42:59.302]  I came across you about a year and a half ago.
[02:42:59.342 --> 02:43:02.046]  I have all of them, and I'm still waiting for the newest one you put out.
[02:43:02.286 --> 02:43:03.647]  And I just got to say, they really are good.
[02:43:03.868 --> 02:43:04.869]  They help wake people up.
[02:43:05.376 --> 02:43:06.637]  Well, thank you very much, sir.
[02:43:06.697 --> 02:43:08.858]  I appreciate you getting Matrix of Evil.
[02:43:09.598 --> 02:43:09.918]  Thank you.
[02:43:09.938 --> 02:43:11.099]  I appreciate it.
[02:43:11.139 --> 02:43:13.840]  Yeah, Matrix of Evil has been shipping out for two weeks now.
[02:43:13.860 --> 02:43:15.881]  I know everybody is feverish to get it.
[02:43:15.901 --> 02:43:18.602]  A lot of you are now telling me you've gotten it and are amazed with it.
[02:43:19.202 --> 02:43:20.923]  And the video is shipping out the door, folks.
[02:43:20.943 --> 02:43:24.184]  So for those that have gotten the other videos and liked them, get the new video.
[02:43:24.204 --> 02:43:25.205]  And here's a good spot to do this.
[02:43:25.225 --> 02:43:26.746]  We'll go to Elias and the other callers.
[02:43:27.646 --> 02:43:31.128]  Paul Watson, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order.
[02:43:31.468 --> 02:43:34.189]  Go through in a minute the different chapters in the book.
[02:43:35.265 --> 02:43:36.346]  Different chapters in the book.
[02:43:36.386 --> 02:43:41.131]  We've got MI5 carrying out terrorism with the Omar bombing in 98.
[02:43:41.371 --> 02:43:50.801]  We've got the Israelis founding and sponsoring Hamas and globalist groups like the EU still funding Hamas to this day.
[02:43:50.861 --> 02:43:51.322]  We've got
[02:43:51.974 --> 02:44:05.299]  Three chapters on September 11th, which goes into more depth about how the actual operation was carried out, not just the prior knowledge issue, but while refraining from getting into holographic planes and all that sort of stuff.
[02:44:05.900 --> 02:44:12.002]  We've got PNAC, the build-up to the Iraq war, how it was all scripted.
[02:44:12.342 --> 02:44:14.023]  A great expose of PNAC.
[02:44:14.783 --> 02:44:18.705]  Yeah, going right up to basically the announcement of the Iraq war.
[02:44:19.651 --> 02:44:20.652]  And how the U.S.
[02:44:20.692 --> 02:44:31.638]  government armed Saddam Hussein in the first place, and then more in-depth information about how, while there is sort of a tiny fissure within the New World Order, the basic overall agenda is the same.
[02:44:31.658 --> 02:44:38.822]  There's just disagreement on how to implement it without people noticing that it's basically a totalitarian takeover.
[02:44:38.842 --> 02:44:45.066]  So in that instance, we do go into some sort of highbrow depth, which that occurs in the later chapters, so...
[02:44:45.766 --> 02:44:50.552]  As I said before, it's good for both novices and people who have studied it.
[02:44:50.973 --> 02:44:52.494]  Yeah, folks, this is the book.
[02:44:52.635 --> 02:44:53.376]  I published it.
[02:44:54.156 --> 02:44:58.161]  It's the best book, and I've read dozens about government-sponsored terror, about the globalists.
[02:44:58.542 --> 02:45:05.110]  You want a tool to wake up that college professor, that high school history teacher, your pastor, your rabbi, whatever.
[02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:06.451]  We're good to go.
[02:45:35.489 --> 02:45:37.052]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:45:37.192 --> 02:45:43.907]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com to get Matrix of Evil, Police State's Retotal Enslavement, Masters of Terror, 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[02:45:44.549 --> 02:45:45.290]  Get the videos.
[02:45:45.310 --> 02:45:45.891]  Get the books.
[02:45:46.696 --> 02:45:46.776]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:45:46.836 --> 02:45:47.896]  Write it down, folks.
[02:45:47.916 --> 02:45:48.836]  Take action.
[02:45:48.856 --> 02:45:51.017]  This is what you can do.
[02:45:51.097 --> 02:45:53.237]  This is a great tool to wake people up.
[02:45:53.257 --> 02:45:53.617]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:45:53.657 --> 02:45:56.218]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:45:56.258 --> 02:45:58.458]  Let's go to Elias in Michigan, then Jess and Kelly.
[02:45:58.478 --> 02:45:58.878]  Elias, go ahead.
[02:46:20.314 --> 02:46:21.194]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:46:21.374 --> 02:46:21.594]  Okay.
[02:46:22.615 --> 02:46:26.296]  In Britain, His Majesty is visiting.
[02:46:26.316 --> 02:46:27.176]  Okay?
[02:46:28.016 --> 02:46:36.099]  As Pinochet visited Britain, they should arrest him with a mass people's movement to bring the criminal to justice.
[02:46:37.239 --> 02:46:40.480]  Now, you certainly realize George Bush is a puppet, doesn't run anything.
[02:46:40.780 --> 02:46:45.662]  Yes, but he is the head, and he is the one, and he is the mass murderer.
[02:46:47.170 --> 02:46:48.391]  Now, other things.
[02:46:48.751 --> 02:46:51.712]  You'll notice that dissent is being squashed.
[02:46:52.392 --> 02:46:57.454]  As you well know, RFPI has been put off the air.
[02:46:58.015 --> 02:46:58.815]  Whether you're interested.
[02:46:58.835 --> 02:47:00.736]  I don't even know what that is.
[02:47:01.316 --> 02:47:02.717]  But anyway, there's another thing.
[02:47:02.997 --> 02:47:05.778]  They're squashing dissent, and others have disappeared from the air.
[02:47:07.860 --> 02:47:08.880]  There's only one thing to do.
[02:47:09.921 --> 02:47:11.563]  He's visiting the provinces.
[02:47:12.484 --> 02:47:18.969]  Paul, he's visiting the province of the United States, which happens to be the isle of, as you say, the beautiful isle.
[02:47:19.249 --> 02:47:21.131]  Okay, but it's time to get him.
[02:47:23.726 --> 02:47:24.467]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:25.527 --> 02:47:29.348]  I wish no harm against President Bush or any other member of the federal government.
[02:47:29.648 --> 02:47:36.910]  I want to wake the good people up in government, and then I want to cause a movement constitutionally to indict criminals for treason.
[02:47:37.290 --> 02:47:38.070]  That's what I want.
[02:47:38.110 --> 02:47:40.711]  Let's talk to Jess in New Jersey.
[02:47:40.731 --> 02:47:41.431]  Go ahead, Jess.
[02:47:42.131 --> 02:47:43.311]  Hi, good afternoon, guys.
[02:47:43.571 --> 02:47:45.532]  I'm a big fan of both of your work.
[02:47:46.952 --> 02:47:49.513]  My question is relating to Princess Diana.
[02:47:51.218 --> 02:47:52.479]  Or the seeming assassination.
[02:47:52.559 --> 02:47:54.980]  We never answered that question from the listener earlier.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:55.780]  Go ahead.
[02:47:58.161 --> 02:48:11.786]  Basically, I think this whole Princess Diana thing is... Or rather, the homosexual allegations or bisexual allegations with Prince Charles is a distraction from the whole Princess Diana assassination.
[02:48:11.806 --> 02:48:13.106]  From the murder, I would agree.
[02:48:14.227 --> 02:48:19.749]  And, I mean, it's just another example of a preemptive type of disclosure.
[02:48:20.450 --> 02:48:21.471]  Yeah, that's with the United Nations.
[02:48:21.591 --> 02:48:21.871]  Comments, Paul?
[02:48:42.483 --> 02:48:49.350]  Well, as soon as the... I mean, I knew about the Prince Charles situation about two weeks before it broke in the British media.
[02:48:49.730 --> 02:48:59.180]  At that point, I was thinking, well, this might be interesting, you know, another royal scandal which shows them to be complete decadent scum, basically, which is what most people in this country think of them, but...
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:15.711]  As soon as it started to break, it did become obvious, and I said this on the website, that it was a blatant distraction from the fact that two weeks previously, this whole Diana thing had come out where she predicted her own death, and it brought up all the evidence to do with the fact that she was killed.
[02:49:15.731 --> 02:49:20.334]  So yes, the Charles bisexual allegation situation is a blatant distraction.
[02:49:20.374 --> 02:49:21.995]  And hey, look what it did for Arnold.
[02:49:22.255 --> 02:49:27.219]  I mean, to be a conservative, you've got to be for open borders, gun control, and in hardcore gay porno mags.
[02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:31.763]  And that was Brazil gave him that statue, by the way.
[02:49:33.625 --> 02:49:37.950]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:38.130 --> 02:49:42.555]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:42.715 --> 02:49:47.080]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:49:47.140 --> 02:49:48.462]  The New World Order.
[02:49:50.247 --> 02:49:54.468]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:54.528 --> 02:50:01.470]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:50:01.590 --> 02:50:03.631]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:50:03.991 --> 02:50:14.313]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:50:14.593 --> 02:50:16.714]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[02:50:16.934 --> 02:50:19.978]  Then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:50:20.479 --> 02:50:23.102]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:50:23.122 --> 02:50:23.703]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:50:23.743 --> 02:50:24.003]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:50:24.263 --> 02:50:25.545]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:38.446]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:50:38.606 --> 02:50:46.694]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:50:46.955 --> 02:50:54.002]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:54.182 --> 02:50:55.463]  radioactive poisoning.
[02:50:55.543 --> 02:51:01.427]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:51:01.627 --> 02:51:06.710]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:51:06.830 --> 02:51:15.695]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:51:15.976 --> 02:51:23.200]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at triple
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:24.682]  Call now and get free shipping.
[02:51:24.842 --> 02:51:25.122]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:51:33.524 --> 02:51:36.247]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name brand medications.
[02:51:36.367 --> 02:51:40.071]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[02:51:57.188 --> 02:51:57.728]  We're good to go.
[02:52:29.029 --> 02:52:29.469]  Don't wait.
[02:52:29.589 --> 02:52:30.350]  Do it today.
[02:52:34.772 --> 02:52:39.914]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:40.595 --> 02:52:42.936]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:52:45.297 --> 02:52:46.017]  Final segment.
[02:52:46.037 --> 02:52:47.618]  Been a great show today.
[02:52:47.638 --> 02:52:51.760]  We do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, back from 9 to midnight central.
[02:52:51.780 --> 02:52:55.522]  Let's try to let Jess, Kelly, and Rick finish up here.
[02:52:56.616 --> 02:52:58.938]  Jess, you've got about 30 seconds left.
[02:52:58.958 --> 02:53:01.301]  If you had something else you wanted to say from New Jersey, go ahead.
[02:53:01.821 --> 02:53:02.702]  Yeah, sure.
[02:53:03.283 --> 02:53:05.485]  The other thing I want to comment on is just these...
[02:53:06.495 --> 02:53:16.458]  The trend with the children's programming on television, it almost seems like the parents in all these situations and the cartoons and such are framed as being idiots.
[02:53:16.898 --> 02:53:18.219]  And I think there's an agenda behind that.
[02:53:18.539 --> 02:53:19.079]  Of course.
[02:53:19.939 --> 02:53:25.601]  And Fox Television, the dad's always bad, the mother's the authority figure, breaking down the family.
[02:53:25.641 --> 02:53:27.942]  It's an official globalist policy.
[02:53:27.982 --> 02:53:29.262]  I've read it hundreds of times.
[02:53:29.622 --> 02:53:31.683]  Official Department of Education policy.
[02:53:32.043 --> 02:53:34.584]  Official activity of Nickelodeon.
[02:53:34.624 --> 02:53:35.724]  They've even bragged about it.
[02:53:36.404 --> 02:53:37.826]  Paul Watson comments to that.
[02:53:38.587 --> 02:53:46.916]  Well, yeah, we've seen this evisceration of the atypical strong father authority figure, which makes a strong family unit.
[02:53:47.016 --> 02:53:48.617]  That's accepted throughout the ages.
[02:53:49.078 --> 02:53:53.823]  And what this leads to is what's going on in this country right now.
[02:53:55.425 --> 02:54:01.408]  Serious talk and actual legislation being introduced that bans parents from smacking their children.
[02:54:01.948 --> 02:54:09.051]  Now, my argument with this is that if criminals are going to abuse children, then why is the law going to stop them?
[02:54:09.071 --> 02:54:19.976]  The only thing the law does is prevent responsible parents from disciplining their children and hands their upbringing over to the state, which is exactly what this kind of legislation seeks to do.
[02:54:20.076 --> 02:54:20.496]  Exactly.
[02:54:20.536 --> 02:54:21.816]  Thanks for the call, Jess.
[02:54:21.876 --> 02:54:22.517]  Kelly in...
[02:54:24.028 --> 02:54:24.428]  Utah.
[02:54:24.468 --> 02:54:25.169]  Go ahead, Kelly.
[02:54:27.250 --> 02:54:28.371]  You're on the air, Kelly.
[02:54:28.431 --> 02:54:32.253]  Someone can get a hold of you like somebody don't want them to talk to you.
[02:54:32.873 --> 02:54:42.779]  Anyway, on November 1st, Sue Ann Campbell, Round Rock, Texas, had her Internet service canceled without explanation by Austin Internet Service Provider Texas.net.
[02:54:44.460 --> 02:54:44.880]  Okay.
[02:54:46.212 --> 02:54:53.522]  Texas Net told her they could no longer supply her special needs and threatened her with being charged with harassment if she tried calling them again.
[02:54:53.883 --> 02:54:58.009]  Well, I mean, if an internet service provider doesn't want to give you service, just go to somebody else.
[02:54:58.449 --> 02:54:59.351]  Yeah, um...
[02:55:00.091 --> 02:55:02.112]  So you're not calling from Utah?
[02:55:02.472 --> 02:55:03.712]  Yes, I am calling from Utah.
[02:55:03.892 --> 02:55:04.272]  Okay.
[02:55:04.872 --> 02:55:11.114]  And Sue Ann never was in error or even advocated violence.
[02:55:11.414 --> 02:55:16.216]  Sue Ann is an activist fighting to expose the ways the government currently harassed citizens.
[02:55:16.356 --> 02:55:16.976]  Yeah, I know her.
[02:55:17.036 --> 02:55:17.896]  She's a nice lady.
[02:55:18.156 --> 02:55:20.737]  I think she had a website about the police state, didn't she?
[02:55:21.177 --> 02:55:21.837]  I believe so.
[02:55:22.197 --> 02:55:23.698]  And then they kicked her website off.
[02:55:24.058 --> 02:55:24.678]  They sure did.
[02:55:27.248 --> 02:55:28.048]  I'll have to talk to her.
[02:55:28.108 --> 02:55:28.829]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:29.569 --> 02:55:31.451]  Let's talk to Rick in New York.
[02:55:31.531 --> 02:55:32.191]  Rick, you're on the air.
[02:55:32.251 --> 02:55:32.571]  Go ahead.
[02:55:32.611 --> 02:55:33.172]  Last caller.
[02:55:33.752 --> 02:55:34.733]  Yeah, what do you call it?
[02:55:34.753 --> 02:55:49.042]  The other night I was up to about 4 a.m., and I was watching C-SPAN, and they had the George Marshall Foundation dinner report, and on it was David Rockefeller, and they were honoring Colin Powell.
[02:55:49.843 --> 02:55:54.906]  And I like what Robert Welch says in The Politician, that Marshall is basically an agent of the Kremlin.
[02:55:56.624 --> 02:55:58.145]  Yeah, but that's only one level of it.
[02:55:58.165 --> 02:56:00.727]  The communists are controlled by the Rothschilds and the big banks.
[02:56:01.067 --> 02:56:01.588]  Oh, of course.
[02:56:01.668 --> 02:56:02.388]  I wouldn't argue that.
[02:56:02.689 --> 02:56:03.209]  I agree with that 100%.
[02:56:04.350 --> 02:56:04.570]  I know.
[02:56:04.610 --> 02:56:07.612]  It's like two weeks ago, Bush gave Kennedy an award.
[02:56:07.672 --> 02:56:08.953]  I mean, it's just disgusting.
[02:56:09.614 --> 02:56:11.215]  It is.
[02:56:11.235 --> 02:56:11.855]  Okay, I'll let you go.
[02:56:11.895 --> 02:56:12.816]  I just wanted to give you that tip.
[02:56:13.156 --> 02:56:15.438]  If you want me to send it to you, you want to see David Rothschild?
[02:56:15.458 --> 02:56:15.518]  Yes.
[02:56:15.998 --> 02:56:16.799]  Yes, please.
[02:56:17.019 --> 02:56:18.100]  I love video like that.
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:18.901]  Thank you.
[02:56:19.701 --> 02:56:20.322]  Thanks for the call.
[02:56:20.342 --> 02:56:21.523]  We're out of time, folks.
[02:56:21.583 --> 02:56:22.783]  Be back tomorrow, back tonight.
[02:56:24.568 --> 02:56:31.132]  Tonight, it's going to be at 7 o'clock, either about 645, Big LBJ Bass Lecture Hall.
[02:56:31.793 --> 02:56:38.677]  They got the former head of CIA counterintelligence terrorism, total new world order, former deputy director of the FBI there.
[02:56:39.418 --> 02:56:40.178]  Come to the event.
[02:56:40.198 --> 02:56:41.279]  They're going to take questions.
[02:56:41.619 --> 02:56:42.400]  Ask them questions.
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:44.981]  I'm not the only one that will be there asking questions.
[02:56:45.001 --> 02:56:46.522]  I want to see you there tonight.
[02:56:46.762 --> 02:56:48.524]  And then, of course, on the radio, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:48.844 --> 02:56:50.645]  Paul Watson, final comments, my good buddy.
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:58.262]  Well, just with the communist thing, we've got another article from Henry Macau today, which talks about the communist capitalist international.
[02:56:58.282 --> 02:57:01.123]  And obviously, it was not just the communist movement.
[02:57:01.163 --> 02:57:04.605]  It was co-opted, just like the New York capitalist movement was co-opted.
[02:57:04.625 --> 02:57:09.086]  So, all control from the top, and we've got that article on the prison planet today.
[02:57:09.666 --> 02:57:15.628]  All right, the globalists actually created and had the communist manifesto written to con the masses back into serfdom.
[02:57:15.988 --> 02:57:17.349]  It's serfdom they call it freedom.
[02:57:18.257 --> 02:57:19.498]  It's all command and control.
[02:57:19.518 --> 02:57:20.318]  Autocracy.
[02:57:20.659 --> 02:57:21.059]  Take care.
[02:57:21.099 --> 02:57:21.719]  See you back tonight.
