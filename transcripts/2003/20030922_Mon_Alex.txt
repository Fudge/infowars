[00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:06.166]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:15.391]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.052 --> 00:00:17.132]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:18.994]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.014 --> 00:00:20.434]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:22.075]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:26.618]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:31.021]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:34.840]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.041]  Welcome back.
[00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:40.985]  Already into the second hour of this worldwide Monday broadcast.
[00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:45.188]  We're about to go to Tim in Georgia and John in Tennessee and many others.
[00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:48.530]  If you want to join us on air, toll-free number.
[00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:51.172]  Any issue you'd like to discuss is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:51.192 --> 00:00:54.775]  I've got a bunch of other news coming up.
[00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:59.819]  A lot of our troops, if they want meals or health care when they're shot, they have to pay for it.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.201]  That's the new conservatism.
[00:01:03.118 --> 00:01:04.759]  Also another bombing in Iraq.
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.422]  I'll tell you what Harvard's up to, saying if you don't like the New World Order, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:11.944]  They actually say that more on the plunging dollar.
[00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:17.708]  Clinton persuades his demon wife, Hillary, to run for president.
[00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:19.609]  Look, it's all coming up.
[00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:21.550]  Right now, as promised, let's go to the calls.
[00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.651]  Tim in Georgia.
[00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:23.952]  Tim, you're on the air.
[00:01:24.032 --> 00:01:24.512]  Welcome.
[00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.433]  Alex, good to talk to you, sir.
[00:01:26.473 --> 00:01:27.434]  Good to talk to you, my friend.
[00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:29.896]  Alex, I'm calling from Savannah, Georgia, and...
[00:01:30.638 --> 00:01:41.065]  Right now the news is kind of going through, not exactly a blitz, but they're playing the stuff on the TV about the red lights and the case for the cameras, and we haven't gone to city council with it yet.
[00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:57.616]  But one thing I've noticed right at the end of my street, there's a main artery going through town called Abercorn Street, and at certain peak hours, not just the yellow light being shortened, the whole sequence being shortened, where I can be four car lengths back from the light,
[00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.092]  Major cities have been caught, and that's it.
[00:02:02.112 --> 00:02:05.455]  We need to create a traffic section on prisonplanet.com.
[00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:07.297]  Very hot issue, Paul.
[00:02:07.337 --> 00:02:08.658]  Talking to my webmaster out there.
[00:02:09.178 --> 00:02:14.402]  We need to have that lady saying last hour she didn't know of them shortening lights.
[00:02:14.502 --> 00:02:15.984]  I've seen a bunch of articles on that.
[00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:17.905]  Post those and post the articles.
[00:02:18.245 --> 00:02:18.866]  Yes, it's true.
[00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:20.127]  They shorten lights constantly.
[00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:25.274]  Right before they wanted us to pass light rail, they always, suddenly, none of the lights work in the city.
[00:02:25.675 --> 00:02:26.375]  Total jams.
[00:02:26.395 --> 00:02:28.977]  They'll have police come out and just block roads off for no reason.
[00:02:29.197 --> 00:02:29.878]  This is admitted.
[00:02:30.298 --> 00:02:31.739]  And the news all harps on it.
[00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.961]  And at the very time, they'll have billboards up that say, tired of the wait?
[00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:35.982]  Vote for light rail.
[00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:37.163]  But that won't matter now.
[00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.544]  They just put in the touchscreens.
[00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:39.865]  They're going to pass it now.
[00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:40.265]  Go ahead.
[00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:41.546]  Exactly, Alex.
[00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:43.907]  Well, this, the whole sequence is shortened, where it turns green.
[00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:45.929]  And I kid you not, I'm not exaggerating.
[00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.771]  It goes green, and then about two seconds later, it goes yellow-red.
[00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:51.897]  And about three cars can get through, and what it does, it puts pressure on everyone.
[00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:52.977]  They just want to get through that light.
[00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:58.841]  And so they go through it, and what will happen is the news teams will show up, and they'll show all these people running the light going, you know what?
[00:02:58.861 --> 00:02:59.721]  We need these cameras.
[00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:00.602]  We've got to do this stuff.
[00:03:01.102 --> 00:03:07.205]  But I also pulled up the thing about San Diego, and what happened in San Diego was back in September 4, 2001, the judge threw out 290 tickets.
[00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:16.267]  Because the city wasn't following the state legislation, and because they were paying fees to Lockheed Martin, so that's why they threw it out.
[00:03:16.547 --> 00:03:20.028]  Yeah, Lockheed Martin was managing the cameras, running and issuing the tickets.
[00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:24.289]  Private groups just going, here's your ticket, no judge, no jury, just buy your ticket.
[00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:25.530]  Well, that's what the judge said.
[00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.450]  He said it was just like giving it to an individual person, so they got it.
[00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.312]  But somehow in July of 2002, they reinstated it, saying that it was such a good thing.
[00:03:34.332 --> 00:03:36.853]  The numbers, we tried to do it, and since we took it away,
[00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.340]  The car crashes went up, so we've got to put it back.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.121]  We've got to take care of these people.
[00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:42.761]  They caught them in Baltimore.
[00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:43.782]  They caught them in D.C.
[00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:51.425]  This has been in the news, shortening the yellow lights, and that's a fact, and it's sinister.
[00:03:51.745 --> 00:03:59.729]  Think of having a big defense agency, basically the CIA, that's what they are, with all these security clearances running the cameras.
[00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:01.190]  I mean, folks, this is DARPA.
[00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.151]  Alex, I'd like to say that a lot of people are waking up here...
[00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:06.664]  Savannah, Georgia is a major military point.
[00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:08.625]  We're the home of the 3rd Infantry.
[00:04:08.645 --> 00:04:09.765]  We've got a Ranger Battalion.
[00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:11.085]  We've got the Marines right across the river.
[00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:12.885]  So all these kids are just coming home.
[00:04:12.925 --> 00:04:16.346]  And, man, you want to talk about 1,000-yard stairs and head on a swivel.
[00:04:16.646 --> 00:04:19.206]  I mean, these kids are just, they're not being trained.
[00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:19.967]  I'm a bartender.
[00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.747]  And these kids in the last few years, they're changed.
[00:04:22.827 --> 00:04:29.228]  They used to be happy-go-lucky, and now they, even before the war started, their head's on a swivel, and it's me-against-them mentality kind of going on.
[00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:31.969]  They're just, you know, it's just they've changed.
[00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:33.609]  The training's changed for them.
[00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:34.881]  Well, it has.
[00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:35.962]  It's like that young Marine.
[00:04:35.982 --> 00:04:39.663]  He says, we're the new Marine Corps for a new world order.
[00:04:40.423 --> 00:04:43.985]  And the General stands up in front of all of them and says, you're the forces of the new world order.
[00:04:45.165 --> 00:04:55.689]  But I got a bunch of articles here that the troops, the Pentagon, they're all turning against Bush as they learn that he's a big government socialist.
[00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:59.550]  Thanks for the call.
[00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.731]  Oh, I was drinking some water.
[00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:01.851]  Went down the wrong way.
[00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:03.212]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:03.232 --> 00:05:03.912]  Stay with us.
[00:05:05.254 --> 00:05:06.475]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:07.635]  Thank you for the call, Tim.
[00:05:10.157 --> 00:05:16.960]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:18.681]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:21.083]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:21.223 --> 00:05:23.324]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:23.584 --> 00:05:28.527]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:28.867 --> 00:05:32.909]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.309]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:33.769]  Or order online
[00:06:09.348 --> 00:06:11.349]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.330]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[00:06:14.251 --> 00:06:25.739]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, I said we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals, and we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:31.547]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:37.051]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[00:06:37.612 --> 00:06:56.407]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.libertydollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island
[00:06:57.054 --> 00:07:02.246]  That's www.libertydollar.org or call toll-free 888-421-6181.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.761]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:17.142]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:07:17.402 --> 00:07:20.283]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:07:20.463 --> 00:07:22.884]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:07:23.064 --> 00:07:31.786]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:07:32.006 --> 00:07:33.387]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:37.948]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:07:38.368 --> 00:07:40.108]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:52.471]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:59.333]  It is so powerful, it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:07:59.553 --> 00:08:02.274]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:08:02.294 --> 00:08:02.494]  Not yet
[00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:13.778]  All right, this is out of Stars and Stripes.
[00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.120]  Been around for decades, covers the military.
[00:08:42.061 --> 00:08:46.324]  Congressman, wounded troops shouldn't be billed for hospital meals.
[00:08:47.745 --> 00:08:48.686]  Arlington, Virginia.
[00:08:48.746 --> 00:08:52.989]  This was written by Sandra Johnst, Stars and Stripes reporter.
[00:08:53.689 --> 00:08:56.291]  Talk about adding insult to injury, said one U.S.
[00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:57.092]  congressman.
[00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:06.739]  Troops wounded in combat in the nation's war on terrorism are being handed more than just discharge papers when they leave military hospitals.
[00:09:08.482 --> 00:09:08.802]  I think.
[00:09:22.012 --> 00:09:22.772]  I was amazed.
[00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:23.993]  I couldn't believe it when I heard it.
[00:09:24.013 --> 00:09:25.634]  It's a representative, C.W.
[00:09:25.994 --> 00:09:34.978]  Billy Young, Republican, Florida, chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, who was introduced a bill to repeal what he calls an offensive law.
[00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:45.403]  Some things don't meet the common sense test, and this is one of them, said a soldier injured in Iraq in June, and who has received two meal bills, one for $24.30...
[00:09:47.068 --> 00:09:58.078]  It's not a good precedent to have when a service member, having received wounds in Iraq, to see the first correspondence from his government after he gets out is a bill to pay for his hospital stay.
[00:10:10.774 --> 00:10:14.015]  Folks, you couldn't come up with stuff like this and put it in a fiction book.
[00:10:14.035 --> 00:10:14.836]  No one would believe it.
[00:10:15.256 --> 00:10:20.318]  No one that I know of has ever charged troops for their food, number one.
[00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:25.860]  Number two, charge them when they're in the hospital.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:34.083]  I mean, this isn't just taking the old 75-year-old men off all their health care, which they did last year in a federal court ruling.
[00:10:34.103 --> 00:10:37.004]  I mean, that's horrible, right when they need it, too.
[00:10:38.145 --> 00:10:39.506]  65 and up, you don't get anything.
[00:10:39.566 --> 00:10:41.106]  You've got to go on Medicare or Medicaid.
[00:10:41.166 --> 00:10:41.747]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:10:42.367 --> 00:10:44.988]  The federal court said, we don't care if you were told when you enlisted.
[00:10:45.008 --> 00:10:51.051]  We don't care if the newsreels and the magazine advertisements that are on the record said that.
[00:10:51.431 --> 00:10:52.711]  That's not a contract.
[00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:54.432]  You don't get anything.
[00:10:56.053 --> 00:10:59.054]  And by the way, whenever I read this,
[00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:09.335]  A few years ago, when I started making the changes and it all got tied up in court, when I covered these articles on air, people could not believe it.
[00:11:10.976 --> 00:11:11.817]  They couldn't believe it.
[00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:17.302]  I would get emails and calls, you're a liar, you're making it up, it's not true.
[00:11:17.862 --> 00:11:23.768]  I remember just about, I don't know, about six months ago, I read the federal court ruling on air.
[00:11:25.194 --> 00:11:34.542]  The second ruling in about the last 10 or 11 months, they had one late in 2002, and then another again in early 2003, saying, yeah, the troops don't get any health care.
[00:11:35.082 --> 00:11:39.145]  And people actually called the network saying, I don't believe it, he's a liar.
[00:11:39.245 --> 00:11:42.388]  Okay, fine, don't believe the stars and stripes either, okay?
[00:11:43.749 --> 00:11:45.691]  I mean, this is troops injured in Iraq.
[00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:47.692]  Just keep denying everything.
[00:11:48.153 --> 00:11:52.056]  Deny the fact that hundreds of media institutions and scientists...
[00:11:52.822 --> 00:11:53.663]  We're good to go.
[00:12:12.426 --> 00:12:24.433]  Thousands and thousands of tons, what is it, 3,400 tons right now, of depleted uranium sprayed, not just shot out by the A-10 warthogs and their Vulcan cannons, that's what it's called.
[00:12:25.634 --> 00:12:29.456]  It's not just shot from the Abrams tanks and Abrams M1A and all the rest of them.
[00:12:29.736 --> 00:12:32.278]  Now the Bradley fighting vehicles have got it in their guns.
[00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:37.081]  And the troops were spraying out their own death.
[00:12:37.981 --> 00:12:39.222]  By the way, the Army sent in
[00:12:41.388 --> 00:12:51.031]  Commander Rook, to disprove all this in 91, the Army biologist and expert on radiation, and he said, yeah, they are sick from radiation exposure.
[00:12:51.451 --> 00:12:52.651]  This DU is very bad.
[00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:54.872]  So they removed him.
[00:12:54.892 --> 00:13:01.413]  He's now traveling the world warning people, doing blood tests of our troops, British troops, Australian troops.
[00:13:01.453 --> 00:13:07.055]  They've got massive levels of it, lesions in their lungs, lesions on their skin, the outside of their bodies.
[00:13:08.482 --> 00:13:12.083]  Masses of troops died from the first Gulf War from sarin and VS exposure.
[00:13:12.364 --> 00:13:13.584]  Now admitted Senate reports.
[00:13:14.504 --> 00:13:15.565]  Never given any treatment.
[00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:20.507]  You're talking about 30-year-old Marine Corps captains who could run marathons.
[00:13:20.587 --> 00:13:31.311]  I remember this guy begging in Congress months before he died in a diaper going, The detectives went off.
[00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:32.211]  We were hit.
[00:13:32.571 --> 00:13:34.892]  Why are you not freed of us?
[00:13:34.952 --> 00:13:35.913]  He starts crying.
[00:13:36.453 --> 00:13:36.973]  They're just like,
[00:13:38.197 --> 00:13:41.980]  And then Chuckie Schumer leads forward and goes, stop that.
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.761]  You know, that's what these people are like, folks.
[00:13:47.163 --> 00:13:48.124]  Nothing wrong with you.
[00:13:48.184 --> 00:13:49.685]  There's nothing wrong with any of you.
[00:13:50.245 --> 00:13:52.126]  It's like all around the World Trade Center.
[00:13:52.427 --> 00:13:54.728]  That thing was full of asbestos, admittedly.
[00:13:55.649 --> 00:14:00.312]  Giant clouds from all the explosions turning the whole buildings into powder.
[00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.191]  Everybody started getting sick.
[00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:05.013]  Nobody was worried about getting breathing apparatus to them.
[00:14:05.093 --> 00:14:06.254]  We did raise money for that.
[00:14:06.274 --> 00:14:11.697]  In fact, we just said, send them gas masks, send them breathers to the local church there across the street.
[00:14:12.998 --> 00:14:20.823]  And now they admit that they knew it was deadly and full of this stuff, and thousands are sick, and the White House signed an order telling the EPA to keep their mouths shut.
[00:14:22.244 --> 00:14:23.825]  I'm not going to be part of this.
[00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.187]  I'm not going to compromise.
[00:14:26.227 --> 00:14:27.568]  I'm not going to sell people out.
[00:14:28.354 --> 00:14:47.988]  You can't just sit here in this country and have 54 million abortions and hang our troops out to dry and live in this la-la land and let Enron steal hundreds of thousands of their employees' pensions and rip off millions of investors and let all these other corporations do this and not have it come back on you.
[00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:49.729]  That's the point about corruption.
[00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:51.350]  It's grown out of control.
[00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.712]  That's why a normal person is upset by corruption.
[00:14:57.952 --> 00:14:59.773]  A normal person is upset by evil.
[00:14:59.974 --> 00:15:01.154]  Gets their hackles up.
[00:15:01.895 --> 00:15:05.357]  What does your guard dog do when somebody they don't know comes around?
[00:15:05.837 --> 00:15:10.621]  Or when they catch somebody doing something bad on your property, they'll attack them.
[00:15:13.022 --> 00:15:14.303]  They'll stand up, they'll fight.
[00:15:14.543 --> 00:15:20.207]  Your dog is smarter and more instinctive and more on the ball than yuppie America.
[00:15:21.778 --> 00:15:23.119]  People see corruption and laugh.
[00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:24.719]  Oh, that's just the way it is.
[00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:28.941]  Yeah, well, when it happens to you, people just say, oh, that's just the way it is.
[00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:30.461]  Let's go back to the calls.
[00:15:30.641 --> 00:15:35.363]  We'll go to John and Meade and Frank and Mark and Howard and others.
[00:15:35.683 --> 00:15:38.104]  John in Tennessee, welcome to the airwaves.
[00:15:38.844 --> 00:15:39.244]  Thank you.
[00:15:39.284 --> 00:15:41.945]  I've got two points on traffic tickets and Mel Gibson.
[00:15:42.946 --> 00:15:48.828]  AmericanAutobahn.com has a AAA article posted on the red light cameras and shortened yellow light.
[00:15:50.355 --> 00:15:52.898]  The author of American Autobahn was on the History Channel.
[00:15:53.718 --> 00:16:00.524]  The History Channel legally drove 212 miles an hour on the German Autobahn, which is better safety than the USA.
[00:16:01.464 --> 00:16:05.968]  In England, magazine editors for Superbike magazine tested red light cameras.
[00:16:06.468 --> 00:16:11.112]  The cameras actually flashed when the light turned green and they pulled away from the intersections.
[00:16:12.152 --> 00:16:12.672]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:16:12.772 --> 00:16:15.033]  Yeah, they call it Lockheed, and now they're doing a bunch of cheating.
[00:16:15.373 --> 00:16:17.373]  And I remember reading stacks of articles.
[00:16:17.473 --> 00:16:24.914]  Everybody email them to my website, and we'll put that lady's article up, because Paul Watson's a great webmaster at Prison Planet.
[00:16:25.455 --> 00:16:32.036]  We'll put her little interview up, and then we'll just post 20 articles, and people can listen to it and find out for themselves.
[00:16:32.196 --> 00:16:35.416]  But notice how they call it a grassroots organization.
[00:16:35.856 --> 00:16:38.577]  Again, last hour, head on, you know, the grassroots organization.
[00:16:39.857 --> 00:16:53.780]  Well, it's unconstitutional for police to prosecute a crime without a witness and without proper service to the process.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:02.382]  On a cartoon this week, they had the cartoon hero taking a copy of the Constitution, wadding it up, and throwing it in the fire.
[00:17:02.982 --> 00:17:04.342]  And that was the hero of the show.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.021]  99% of the time... Let me stop you.
[00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:08.942]  What cartoon was that?
[00:17:09.082 --> 00:17:11.704]  I didn't recognize it, and I haven't seen it again.
[00:17:11.744 --> 00:17:14.226]  I just caught the last 30 seconds of it.
[00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:15.888]  Okay, what network were you watching?
[00:17:15.908 --> 00:17:16.928]  The Cartoon Network.
[00:17:16.988 --> 00:17:18.530]  Okay, and a lot of folks watch that.
[00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.253]  They have children, and somebody calling and telling me, what did the superhero look like?
[00:17:22.273 --> 00:17:22.853]  What was he doing?
[00:17:23.053 --> 00:17:33.762]  He was very strange, odd, sort of a cartoon-looking figure, like Gumby or something, and he was getting ready to make out with his cartoon girlfriend, so they
[00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:36.086]  Oh, they call that, is that Adult Swim?
[00:17:36.106 --> 00:17:36.206]  Yes.
[00:17:36.246 --> 00:17:37.287]  And that's on the Cartoon Network?
[00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:40.667]  Yes, I've never seen it before.
[00:17:40.707 --> 00:17:41.908]  Here I am, the cartoon expert.
[00:17:41.988 --> 00:17:43.388]  But no, I've just flipped through.
[00:17:43.408 --> 00:17:45.608]  I know they have the more racy cartoons at night.
[00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.791]  As if children don't watch it.
[00:18:04.031 --> 00:18:06.533]  They watch it all day in the day, but they're not going to watch it at night.
[00:18:08.534 --> 00:18:09.395]  Go ahead, finish up.
[00:18:09.415 --> 00:18:18.700]  99% of the time, traffic lights are installed without the required traffic engineering surveys on the 85th percentile average speed of traffic.
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.783]  Speed limits are always invalid for setting traffic light timing.
[00:18:22.823 --> 00:18:24.904]  It has to be based on the real world speed.
[00:18:25.625 --> 00:18:31.168]  And traffic courts routinely use fraud in traffic ticket cases because traffic tickets are always
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.583]  Using civil rules procedure, but they trick people with pride.
[00:18:35.624 --> 00:18:36.264]  I understand that.
[00:18:36.564 --> 00:18:37.505]  You're making great points.
[00:18:37.545 --> 00:18:38.446]  What about Mel Gibson?
[00:18:40.108 --> 00:18:49.496]  They had a thing on the Jewish Australian Fox News network quoting Gibson as saying he wanted to go to the homes of the critics of the Passion and cut their heads off.
[00:18:50.237 --> 00:18:55.682]  And so the Jewish female announcer implied that all Christians are crazy and need to be controlled and censored.
[00:18:58.248 --> 00:19:01.631]  Well, and now, they didn't have Gibson up there saying that.
[00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:02.532]  Right.
[00:19:03.092 --> 00:19:04.373]  They didn't verify that quote.
[00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:06.235]  They just alleged it, and I don't know if it's true.
[00:19:06.675 --> 00:19:12.180]  Well, it's getting more and more amazing because Mel Gibson's never said anything anti-Semitic, never did anything bad.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.162]  His book's right out of the, you know, his movie's right out of the Bible.
[00:19:15.883 --> 00:19:19.866]  And they're now, for those that didn't hear, ADL says he is an anti-Semite.
[00:19:20.467 --> 00:19:22.688]  And he is bad, and they are going to boycott the film.
[00:19:23.369 --> 00:19:30.073]  After Gibson, and Gibson now admits that he did cut stuff out for them, he said, quote, I'm worried they'll come to my house and get me.
[00:19:30.693 --> 00:19:32.515]  He didn't say I'm going to go to their house and get them.
[00:19:32.735 --> 00:19:35.877]  Right, I figured it was a misquote, and they just lie and just make it up.
[00:19:36.057 --> 00:19:37.177]  Well, that sounds like Fox.
[00:19:37.498 --> 00:19:42.981]  You need to, but I mean, now I guess if you say you love America, you're a Nazi.
[00:19:43.021 --> 00:19:47.644]  I mean, I guess saying you, just, I mean, folks, what are we going to put up with here?
[00:19:49.145 --> 00:19:51.766]  I guess Pat Robertson will come out and say we've got to burn the Bible.
[00:19:51.866 --> 00:19:52.787]  It's anti-Semitic.
[00:19:54.328 --> 00:19:54.828]  Incredible.
[00:19:54.848 --> 00:19:55.148]  Thanks.
[00:19:55.168 --> 00:19:55.908]  Thanks for the call.
[00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:59.210]  That's really something.
[00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:06.453]  Folks, this article I've got, the things they say about Gibson, he's done nothing.
[00:20:06.493 --> 00:20:07.914]  He capitulated to them.
[00:20:11.573 --> 00:20:17.500]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.983]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:20:20.183 --> 00:20:26.510]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver, 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:27.531]  We're good to go.
[00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:47.603]  We're good to go.
[00:20:47.623 --> 00:20:47.823]  I think?
[00:21:09.105 --> 00:21:12.367]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:12.507 --> 00:21:16.729]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:19.870]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.472]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:22.672 --> 00:21:31.396]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:31.596 --> 00:21:32.977]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:21:33.197 --> 00:21:37.559]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:21:37.899 --> 00:21:38.400]  We're good to go.
[00:21:57.282 --> 00:22:02.086]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:22:02.126 --> 00:22:06.590]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:22:18.741 --> 00:22:23.603]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:22:23.963 --> 00:22:25.764]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:22:25.804 --> 00:22:26.824]  can barely be read.
[00:22:27.124 --> 00:22:28.104]  It has faded that much.
[00:22:28.445 --> 00:22:32.346]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[00:22:32.606 --> 00:22:40.949]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.
[00:22:41.229 --> 00:22:49.096]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95 shipping included.
[00:22:49.396 --> 00:22:53.340]  And as a special gift for ordering now, you will also receive a commemorative U.S.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.682]  Constitution proof silver dollar with your order.
[00:22:55.962 --> 00:23:01.207]  Call now toll-free 800-686-2237 and order the documents of freedom.
[00:23:01.507 --> 00:23:02.007]  Don't wait.
[00:23:02.267 --> 00:23:02.908]  Do it today.
[00:23:03.268 --> 00:23:03.709]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:23:08.556 --> 00:23:09.376]  Oh, my God!
[00:23:09.637 --> 00:23:14.359]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:23:14.639 --> 00:23:15.300]  Yes, it's true.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.101]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:23:18.241 --> 00:23:22.263]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:23:22.363 --> 00:23:22.943]  You heard it right.
[00:23:23.104 --> 00:23:25.745]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief...
[00:23:25.865 --> 00:23:26.786]  We're good to go.
[00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:47.341]  We're good to go.
[00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:47.882]  We're good to go.
[00:23:47.962 --> 00:23:48.282]  We're good to go.
[00:24:16.151 --> 00:24:17.472]  All right, my friends, we're back live.
[00:24:17.492 --> 00:24:20.353]  Let's go straight back to your calls and into some more vital news.
[00:24:21.574 --> 00:24:25.156]  Let's go ahead and talk to Meade in Maryland.
[00:24:25.216 --> 00:24:25.616]  Go ahead.
[00:24:25.636 --> 00:24:26.136]  You're on the air.
[00:24:26.176 --> 00:24:27.617]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:24:28.037 --> 00:24:28.397]  Fine.
[00:24:28.457 --> 00:24:34.260]  We've got a couple questions for you and comments on the traffic lights.
[00:24:35.161 --> 00:24:40.503]  In Maryland here, we have these indicators on the lights for when an ambulance comes.
[00:24:40.583 --> 00:24:43.705]  If it's not red for you, they can change it and go through.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:51.466]  And I know some people who have been going down the road and the ambulance comes up and turns the light red so they can go through and they get a ticket.
[00:24:54.108 --> 00:24:54.928]  Oh, I understand.
[00:24:54.988 --> 00:24:59.832]  In fact, I've actually seen that in one of the stories that you say you're a fireman?
[00:25:00.633 --> 00:25:01.794]  No, I work for the town.
[00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:04.336]  Okay, I must have misunderstood what you were saying.
[00:25:04.916 --> 00:25:08.319]  The ambulance drivers have these little remotes that change the lights.
[00:25:09.798 --> 00:25:13.299]  So that, you know, they can be more expedient getting you to the hospital if you're in the ambulance?
[00:25:13.339 --> 00:25:14.339]  Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:25:14.459 --> 00:25:21.480]  But when they put the light on you, why should you get a ticket if it didn't go through the normal, you know, green, yellow, red process?
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.341]  So you're in the city of Maryland?
[00:25:26.641 --> 00:25:28.861]  I'm on the eastern shore.
[00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:31.822]  Are you in Baltimore, I'm going to say?
[00:25:31.842 --> 00:25:33.082]  35, 45 minutes outside of Baltimore.
[00:25:33.602 --> 00:25:33.802]  Yeah.
[00:25:34.602 --> 00:25:37.103]  Of course, the state's Maryland, the city's...
[00:25:38.543 --> 00:25:42.624]  Are people angry about that?
[00:25:44.065 --> 00:25:44.905]  Some are.
[00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:49.086]  There's always people who go along with the program.
[00:25:51.286 --> 00:25:51.787]  Absolutely.
[00:25:53.027 --> 00:25:54.347]  Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[00:25:54.367 --> 00:25:57.728]  My sister lives in Ohio.
[00:25:57.848 --> 00:26:00.589]  They have the cameras on their interstate.
[00:26:01.369 --> 00:26:04.230]  If you're going faster than the speed limit, they take a picture of you
[00:26:05.292 --> 00:26:12.821]  Telling you where the time of day, the date, the picture of the front of your car with whoever's at the wheel and your tag, and then mail you a ticket.
[00:26:14.497 --> 00:26:17.038]  Yeah, these things are going in all over the place.
[00:26:17.198 --> 00:26:20.240]  And again, this is the type of society we want to live in.
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.400]  The government's too big.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.181]  It's taken too many of our liberties.
[00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:27.423]  They've got all these excuses about how it's, oh, it's for safety.
[00:26:27.863 --> 00:26:29.544]  Now they want to tax fast food.
[00:26:29.604 --> 00:26:31.225]  Now they want to tax sugary stuff.
[00:26:31.745 --> 00:26:34.646]  Now they want to take more private property.
[00:26:34.686 --> 00:26:38.288]  It's for the little birds and the bees.
[00:26:38.348 --> 00:26:39.788]  It's always to help somebody.
[00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:41.769]  It's always because they love us.
[00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:43.370]  Those are our luxury taxes.
[00:26:44.645 --> 00:26:45.205]  Absolutely.
[00:26:45.245 --> 00:26:48.246]  Well, it's like this new article here coming out.
[00:26:48.406 --> 00:26:50.466]  Next, no cigarettes in your car.
[00:26:51.686 --> 00:27:01.988]  Albany, New York, smoking even the privacy of your own car could be banned under one of at least five state bills introduced in the past year to limit where a person can light up.
[00:27:02.868 --> 00:27:10.770]  And it says from public beaches to carnivals to a person's private vehicle, legislation would make it more difficult for smokers to take a drink.
[00:27:12.239 --> 00:27:15.120]  We must control government in our personal areas of life.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.060]  Absolutely.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:16.740]  Thanks for the call.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.581]  I appreciate it, Meade.
[00:27:17.601 --> 00:27:18.441]  Call back any time.
[00:27:19.101 --> 00:27:22.102]  And that dovetails into this article out of the BBC.
[00:27:23.543 --> 00:27:26.844]  Website owners face prosecution.
[00:27:27.784 --> 00:27:33.005]  Ensuring websites are easy for disabled people to use is no longer an option.
[00:27:33.085 --> 00:27:34.506]  It is a legal obligation.
[00:27:34.526 --> 00:27:37.627]  The Royal National Institute of the Blind...
[00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:46.360]  In Peterborough is warning that anyone running a site faces prosecution if they fail to comply with the new law.
[00:27:47.421 --> 00:27:59.888]  And they go on to say anything too fancy, any type of graphics or flash animation that cannot be read by someone who's blind, that it doesn't have the audio feature, you're going to be criminally charged and arrested.
[00:28:00.628 --> 00:28:02.789]  And of course this will all be selectively enforced.
[00:28:02.809 --> 00:28:06.951]  So see, now you just can't publish a newspaper online
[00:28:09.418 --> 00:28:14.001]  And most people don't have the money to have all this software or make all this accessible.
[00:28:14.381 --> 00:28:15.882]  And we have a lot of blind listeners.
[00:28:15.942 --> 00:28:17.423]  I'd like to hear from you on this issue.
[00:28:17.944 --> 00:28:22.447]  You've told me that Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are very easy to navigate.
[00:28:23.467 --> 00:28:24.868]  But we do have some flash.
[00:28:24.908 --> 00:28:29.051]  We do have some areas where the text is not readable.
[00:28:30.071 --> 00:28:33.674]  And we don't have the staff to make the whole thing readable.
[00:28:34.014 --> 00:28:35.695]  And they're trying to pass laws like that here.
[00:28:35.995 --> 00:28:37.036]  Where's the freedom?
[00:28:38.197 --> 00:28:38.697]  Where is it?
[00:28:39.344 --> 00:28:56.554]  See, it all sounds so good, but there's in fact a law here in this country concerning the newspapers, that if they enforce it, could make them put out a version for the blind, which would basically be impossible.
[00:28:57.775 --> 00:29:00.156]  That is an actual paper, hard copy version.
[00:29:00.596 --> 00:29:01.497]  You see how...
[00:29:02.512 --> 00:29:04.552]  We'll come back and talk to Frank.
[00:29:04.572 --> 00:29:05.793]  We'll come back and talk to Frank.
[00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:42.233]  Howard, Miguel, Manuel, others, toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:44.673 --> 00:29:48.494]  And I still haven't gotten into the big stack of really serious news.
[00:29:48.534 --> 00:29:57.337]  Got a big old thick stack on government assassination attempts and where they've been successful, a bunch of news on the economy, the war on Iraq, it's all coming up.
[00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.430]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:03.531]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.431 --> 00:30:07.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:12.134]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[00:30:12.334 --> 00:30:15.195]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[00:30:15.435 --> 00:30:17.255]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:30:17.595 --> 00:30:18.956]  Rates are low right now.
[00:30:19.096 --> 00:30:20.256]  Call and compare.
[00:30:20.516 --> 00:30:24.438]  For example, 344-38 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:30:24.658 --> 00:30:24.998]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:30:25.078 --> 00:30:26.538]  Protect your family.
[00:30:32.236 --> 00:30:34.978]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:30:34.998 --> 00:30:38.941]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:42.044 --> 00:30:45.486]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:30:46.767 --> 00:30:47.428]  Welcome back.
[00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:56.515]  Alright, I'm going to run through five, six more calls as fast as I can, and then I'm going to jump back in the news for the balance of this hour.
[00:30:58.183 --> 00:31:04.267]  And then we'll go back into calls next hour, and then back into news, kind of flip-flop back and forth between these two key areas.
[00:31:05.748 --> 00:31:07.329]  But boy, wait till you hear all this news.
[00:31:07.409 --> 00:31:08.470]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.973]  A bunch of different CIA assassination news has been coming out.
[00:31:13.713 --> 00:31:14.774]  Very, very interesting.
[00:31:15.794 --> 00:31:19.337]  Let's go ahead and talk to Frank in New York.
[00:31:19.437 --> 00:31:20.377]  Frank, you're on the air.
[00:31:20.417 --> 00:31:20.838]  Go ahead.
[00:31:20.938 --> 00:31:21.518]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:31:21.598 --> 00:31:23.980]  Greetings from the Soviet Socialist State of New York.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.561]  Well, greetings from the...
[00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:29.379]  New World Order base camp of Austin, Texas.
[00:31:29.739 --> 00:31:30.500]  Oh, well, I'll tell you.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.201]  We got Hillary, and we got Chuck Schumer, and we got George Pataki.
[00:31:33.241 --> 00:31:36.963]  But I think Hillary's going to be hanging around for another year or two, and then I think she's going to make the big move.
[00:31:37.303 --> 00:31:38.864]  I really think she's going to move for the presidency.
[00:31:38.944 --> 00:31:41.785]  That's what they say Bill Clinton is urging her to run.
[00:31:42.731 --> 00:31:44.832]  Again, I mean, there's no lesser of two evils.
[00:31:44.852 --> 00:31:46.072]  They're all business partners.
[00:31:46.092 --> 00:31:46.432]  Oh, I agree.
[00:31:46.612 --> 00:31:46.892]  I agree.
[00:31:46.912 --> 00:31:49.813]  Wesley Clark is being brought in, I think, the week and the other candidates.
[00:31:49.853 --> 00:31:51.153]  Then she'll make the grand appearance.
[00:31:51.194 --> 00:31:53.914]  He'll jump on board as VP candidate anyway.
[00:31:54.194 --> 00:31:55.535]  That's what a lot of people are saying.
[00:31:55.635 --> 00:31:56.095]  That is true.
[00:31:56.355 --> 00:32:01.276]  The reason I called, Alex, is I've got your tape, and it's a great tape, and I've given it to different people.
[00:32:01.857 --> 00:32:06.378]  And to one person, I happened to mention that the Chinese were actually eating aborted fetuses.
[00:32:07.078 --> 00:32:08.198]  And he rolled his eyes.
[00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:10.039]  And I think I had him going pretty good.
[00:32:10.498 --> 00:32:11.980]  And I think that might have turned them off.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.802]  Now, do you know where I could document that?
[00:32:13.822 --> 00:32:17.186]  Are you talking about Police State 3 total enslavement?
[00:32:17.807 --> 00:32:18.247]  No, no, no.
[00:32:18.267 --> 00:32:20.490]  I got the 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:32:21.071 --> 00:32:22.432]  I heard you mention on the radio.
[00:32:22.452 --> 00:32:24.555]  9-11 Road to Tyranny doesn't have the Chinese eating foods.
[00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:26.537]  No, no, I know, but I heard you mention that on the radio.
[00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:28.640]  Well, no, I mean, there is... I don't want to...
[00:32:29.272 --> 00:32:34.276]  Going too much to tell with this, but it's right off Channel 4, National British Television.
[00:32:34.956 --> 00:32:39.860]  We have a still, I'm not going to show video of it, folks, of what they showed on TV over there.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.563]  They set on the show, it's a wonderful thing, and we have video of them eating a baby.
[00:32:44.124 --> 00:32:46.005]  Now, this aired in England, this is admitted.
[00:32:46.045 --> 00:32:53.511]  There's a group of artists in China that enjoy eating children, and it is a health food, the smaller fetuses.
[00:32:54.151 --> 00:32:57.354]  I really don't want, this is too graphic, but we've got to talk about it to warn people.
[00:32:58.112 --> 00:33:00.013]  And police state three total enslavement.
[00:33:00.033 --> 00:33:03.315]  I mean, I told folks, it's hard to describe what's in this film.
[00:33:03.395 --> 00:33:06.097]  It's two hours, 40 minutes long, but about one minute.
[00:33:06.961 --> 00:33:16.226]  Is the Times of London and the London Guardian and a Taiwanese newspaper and then a still image off the Channel 4 show.
[00:33:16.386 --> 00:33:17.746]  We didn't show the actual video.
[00:33:17.766 --> 00:33:20.828]  We just showed a still of a man eating the baby.
[00:33:21.608 --> 00:33:23.769]  But I can document that through the London Guardian?
[00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:25.870]  The Guardian, the Times of London.
[00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:27.191]  Yes, sir.
[00:33:27.491 --> 00:33:29.172]  You don't happen to know the dates.
[00:33:29.412 --> 00:33:30.433]  I know you've got a photo check.
[00:33:30.453 --> 00:33:31.253]  Put it in the film.
[00:33:31.333 --> 00:33:32.394]  I'm telling you it's in the film.
[00:33:32.414 --> 00:33:32.934]  It's in the film?
[00:33:34.306 --> 00:33:34.686]  Pardon me?
[00:33:34.706 --> 00:33:35.527]  It's in your film?
[00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:38.109]  It's in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:33:38.209 --> 00:33:38.930]  Oh, okay.
[00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.552]  It's got the baby being eaten, okay?
[00:33:41.752 --> 00:33:42.212]  Okay, yeah.
[00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:43.874]  I mean, I'm not so much concerned about the graphics.
[00:33:43.934 --> 00:33:46.196]  It's just that, you know, if I could see it in print somewhere, I could.
[00:33:46.216 --> 00:33:47.697]  No, I mean, you can show them the video.
[00:33:48.057 --> 00:33:51.280]  What happens is, we don't just show the still of the video.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:51.680]  You understand?
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.942]  I'm not going to show video of a baby being eaten.
[00:33:54.362 --> 00:33:55.343]  I just show a still.
[00:33:55.523 --> 00:33:57.905]  You know, here's the British TV logo.
[00:33:58.125 --> 00:33:59.607]  Here's a still of a baby getting eaten.
[00:33:59.867 --> 00:34:01.148]  I just show it for a few seconds.
[00:34:01.668 --> 00:34:05.990]  Okay, then I show news articles about the baby eating.
[00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:07.810]  That's what I'm concerned.
[00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:08.751]  That's what I'm looking for.
[00:34:09.351 --> 00:34:16.814]  Yeah, and if somebody wants this article about wounded troops shouldn't be billed for hospital meals, that's stars and stripes.
[00:34:16.914 --> 00:34:18.934]  I mean, I know this stuff's unbelievable.
[00:34:19.034 --> 00:34:20.795]  I don't blame your friend for not believing it.
[00:34:20.935 --> 00:34:22.936]  You know, he kind of rolled his eyes, you know what I mean?
[00:34:23.156 --> 00:34:25.457]  And he was coming along with the program, you know what I mean?
[00:34:25.497 --> 00:34:26.157]  I'm trying to educate him.
[00:34:26.539 --> 00:34:29.120]  And then I told him that one, and he rolled his eyes, and I said, well, I'll find out.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.401]  I was going to ask a couple people, and I said, hey, I got a chance today.
[00:34:31.441 --> 00:34:32.021]  I'm home from work.
[00:34:32.101 --> 00:34:32.821]  I'll give you a call.
[00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:33.702]  And I appreciate it.
[00:34:33.722 --> 00:34:34.502]  Keep up the good work.
[00:34:34.542 --> 00:34:35.222]  You're a warrior.
[00:34:35.622 --> 00:34:36.363]  Oh, you are, sir.
[00:34:36.423 --> 00:34:36.923]  God bless you.
[00:34:36.943 --> 00:34:38.203]  And I'm glad you asked that question.
[00:34:38.283 --> 00:34:41.104]  I mean, folks, any time you want to know where something came from, ask me.
[00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:45.286]  But I can generally tell you major British newspapers.
[00:34:46.406 --> 00:34:48.587]  And be creative.
[00:34:48.627 --> 00:34:49.807]  Come up with a good headline.
[00:34:49.867 --> 00:34:51.208]  Type it into a search engine.
[00:34:52.725 --> 00:34:56.266]  I know if you type in Channel 4 to air baby eating.
[00:34:56.526 --> 00:34:59.046]  In fact, I don't know how I remember that, but that's the headline, okay?
[00:34:59.366 --> 00:35:03.807]  Channel 4 to air baby eating, I think, draws protest.
[00:35:03.967 --> 00:35:04.548]  There you go.
[00:35:04.568 --> 00:35:06.308]  I believe that's the exact headline.
[00:35:07.768 --> 00:35:08.448]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:35:09.509 --> 00:35:11.589]  That should get you a couple hundred hits right there.
[00:35:12.029 --> 00:35:17.110]  Okay, I know it's on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com in the search engine.
[00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.311]  You can type it into our search engine.
[00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:20.411]  It should come up for you, too.
[00:35:21.551 --> 00:35:25.152]  It's going to take a little bit of work on your part to find articles that are six months old.
[00:35:26.393 --> 00:35:32.215]  People keep emailing me saying, where's the news article where it shows them choking a woman to put her in a mobile execution van?
[00:35:34.876 --> 00:35:39.757]  Well, I mean, that was in a bunch of foreign papers, and it's in the film Police State's Retotal Enslavement.
[00:35:40.577 --> 00:35:41.898]  And it's official.
[00:35:41.978 --> 00:35:50.941]  Chinese newspapers are very proud of their 24 mobile death vans that just drive around grabbing political dissidents and killing them, and then they gut them in the back of the van and
[00:35:52.641 --> 00:35:56.965]  People didn't believe that China has forced abortion and infanticide.
[00:35:56.985 --> 00:36:02.209]  Can you imagine a Jeffrey Dahmer-type kidnapping a woman and enforcing an abortion on her?
[00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:09.415]  That's basically what Charlie Manson did.
[00:36:11.496 --> 00:36:14.118]  Charlie Manson carving women open, taking babies out of them.
[00:36:14.158 --> 00:36:16.780]  I don't want to continue this discussion, but now that you've brought it up, we have to.
[00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:18.242]  Can you imagine?
[00:36:18.262 --> 00:36:19.763]  That's what goes on in China every day.
[00:36:20.968 --> 00:36:21.328]  Okay?
[00:36:21.648 --> 00:36:22.589]  The equivalent of that.
[00:36:22.729 --> 00:36:24.169]  Murdering a baby in the womb.
[00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:30.791]  And I just repent, folks, for even being part of this country and part of the system that does this.
[00:36:31.131 --> 00:36:32.692]  I hope God has mercy on us all.
[00:36:33.432 --> 00:36:34.272]  54 million.
[00:36:35.413 --> 00:36:35.893]  Okay?
[00:36:37.573 --> 00:36:38.533]  Face our sin.
[00:36:38.914 --> 00:36:43.775]  You can't kill 54 million defenseless people and think you're going to live in a free country.
[00:36:43.955 --> 00:36:45.056]  Can't you figure that out?
[00:36:45.276 --> 00:36:46.376]  That you reap what you sow?
[00:36:47.324 --> 00:36:49.746]  But people for years couldn't believe that China did this.
[00:36:50.046 --> 00:36:50.786]  It's official.
[00:36:51.287 --> 00:36:55.489]  China will drive up, grab your newborn baby, and drown it right in front of you.
[00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.831]  That's right.
[00:36:57.851 --> 00:37:00.573]  And then they take it and sell it for medical experiments.
[00:37:03.134 --> 00:37:05.676]  I don't like even talking about this stuff.
[00:37:05.736 --> 00:37:06.857]  I get depressed by this.
[00:37:07.577 --> 00:37:09.538]  I'm sick of having to focus on it, okay?
[00:37:09.558 --> 00:37:10.619]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:37:12.173 --> 00:37:14.935]  But we've got to be positive about the fight against it.
[00:37:14.955 --> 00:37:16.256]  We've got to keep our morale up.
[00:37:16.296 --> 00:37:25.302]  But subjects like this just throw me into a tailspin because I understand what you're up against, Frank, and the people that can't face the facts.
[00:37:25.742 --> 00:37:27.864]  And they'll just laugh at you about a serious issue.
[00:37:29.265 --> 00:37:36.910]  He doesn't think that they'll eat babies, but they'll kill hundreds of millions in that country, 54 million in this country.
[00:37:40.726 --> 00:37:41.467]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:37:42.307 --> 00:37:43.268]  Let's go ahead.
[00:37:44.529 --> 00:37:46.410]  You ought to see the stuff I've been mailed from England.
[00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.892]  You think our television's bad?
[00:37:47.912 --> 00:37:48.652]  It is bad.
[00:37:50.333 --> 00:37:52.335]  I mean, it is just degrading the human spirit.
[00:37:52.755 --> 00:37:55.277]  I have a bunch of listeners in the United Kingdom, great folks.
[00:37:55.778 --> 00:37:59.801]  I saw the New World Order targeting them so hard with all this propaganda.
[00:38:00.221 --> 00:38:02.343]  It is the most horrible stuff I get sent.
[00:38:02.643 --> 00:38:05.525]  A broadcast mainstream British television.
[00:38:06.706 --> 00:38:09.368]  I mean, this baby-eating show said it was just wonderful.
[00:38:12.469 --> 00:38:17.151]  I got weird shows where these women are all sitting around eating placenta.
[00:38:18.332 --> 00:38:19.673]  And it's like some weird ritual.
[00:38:20.233 --> 00:38:22.114]  This just airs on TV over there.
[00:38:22.394 --> 00:38:24.855]  Half the children's shows are about witchcraft.
[00:38:25.335 --> 00:38:28.997]  Let's go ahead and talk to Howard in Texas.
[00:38:29.037 --> 00:38:30.038]  Howard, thanks for holding.
[00:38:30.078 --> 00:38:30.478]  Go ahead.
[00:38:31.659 --> 00:38:32.179]  Hey, Alex.
[00:38:32.899 --> 00:38:36.061]  You know that lady with the red light runners?
[00:38:36.761 --> 00:38:38.042]  She needs to go to Hawaii.
[00:38:39.162 --> 00:38:40.503]  They got a great system, Alex.
[00:38:41.714 --> 00:38:44.435]  What they've done is done the exact opposite with the yellow light.
[00:38:45.015 --> 00:38:49.076]  They extend the yellow light, and what happens is it turns red.
[00:38:49.636 --> 00:38:53.437]  Then they delay the red light for the cross traffic.
[00:38:53.517 --> 00:38:58.758]  They delay that light to make sure everything is clear from the intersection, and it turns green.
[00:38:59.418 --> 00:39:05.039]  It probably drives a lot of people here in Texas crazy, all across the United States, but it does work, Alex.
[00:39:05.976 --> 00:39:07.856]  They've reduced the accidents.
[00:39:07.876 --> 00:39:09.737]  There are problems.
[00:39:09.757 --> 00:39:10.577]  There are wrecks.
[00:39:10.897 --> 00:39:12.397]  There are a bunch of idiot drivers.
[00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:13.918]  Yuppies and illegals.
[00:39:14.478 --> 00:39:15.838]  Yuppies are probably the worst, frankly.
[00:39:15.858 --> 00:39:17.198]  They're probably the worst illegal aliens.
[00:39:17.238 --> 00:39:18.119]  I'll agree with her on that.
[00:39:18.879 --> 00:39:23.300]  But I would then add to this equation that it's admitted.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.940]  It's the military-industrial complex running these.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.481]  They've been caught shortening them.
[00:39:27.701 --> 00:39:29.041]  They've been caught running scams.
[00:39:29.181 --> 00:39:30.681]  I've read so many articles on it.
[00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:31.581]  It's bad.
[00:39:31.722 --> 00:39:32.742]  Cameras are bad.
[00:39:32.782 --> 00:39:33.902]  We need less cameras.
[00:39:34.434 --> 00:39:37.215]  You don't need cameras if you do it the way the Hawaiians did it.
[00:39:37.355 --> 00:39:38.736]  Well, these cops better be smart.
[00:39:38.856 --> 00:39:40.296]  The police better come out against these.
[00:39:40.436 --> 00:39:42.377]  Because you will lose your job, gentlemen.
[00:39:43.157 --> 00:39:44.578]  Or you won't be out giving tickets.
[00:39:44.598 --> 00:39:46.939]  You'll be out disarming gun owners.
[00:39:47.379 --> 00:39:50.640]  They want you to be busy doing that, not giving red light tickets.
[00:39:52.581 --> 00:39:57.303]  And when it comes to the military and the billing, it's micromanaging.
[00:39:58.083 --> 00:40:03.165]  Somebody in Congress or somebody passed a law that said they have to send all this stuff out.
[00:40:03.652 --> 00:40:06.014]  They even send you, Alex, as a soldier.
[00:40:06.715 --> 00:40:16.724]  You get a statement of all your medical expenses and the total cost of your yearly medical expenses being a soldier in the military.
[00:40:16.784 --> 00:40:24.450]  Yeah, you see, about five years ago, they started sending you a bill, but it says, but we're paying this for you.
[00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:28.414]  They're creating the record that they don't have to give you this care.
[00:40:28.714 --> 00:40:29.655]  It's contracted.
[00:40:30.342 --> 00:40:30.822]  That's right.
[00:40:31.022 --> 00:40:31.962]  And see how good we are?
[00:40:32.002 --> 00:40:37.984]  Now they're going to take the care away from the soldiers that have been shot and have come back from Iraq.
[00:40:38.344 --> 00:40:40.204]  Folks, that's sick.
[00:40:41.765 --> 00:40:42.965]  It's asinine.
[00:40:44.305 --> 00:40:47.146]  Let's put it that way.
[00:40:47.166 --> 00:40:47.866]  It's ridiculous.
[00:40:47.926 --> 00:40:48.606]  It's conservative.
[00:40:49.786 --> 00:40:50.487]  Oh, you're right.
[00:40:50.627 --> 00:40:51.447]  It's conservative.
[00:40:51.467 --> 00:40:53.567]  Gun control, open borders, it's conservative.
[00:40:53.587 --> 00:40:56.128]  You're a socialist because you're for freedom, Howard.
[00:40:56.878 --> 00:40:58.359]  Oh, right, right, right.
[00:40:58.399 --> 00:40:59.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:40:59.840]  Thanks for the call.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.561]  I appreciate it.
[00:41:00.901 --> 00:41:01.521]  I appreciate it.
[00:41:01.802 --> 00:41:03.243]  Manuel in Pennsylvania.
[00:41:03.283 --> 00:41:03.723]  Go ahead.
[00:41:05.164 --> 00:41:05.824]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:41:05.844 --> 00:41:06.725]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:41:07.145 --> 00:41:07.385]  Great.
[00:41:07.405 --> 00:41:07.766]  Go ahead.
[00:41:09.147 --> 00:41:14.290]  Have you ever seen the official logo for the Marine Corps' Urban Warfighting Laboratory?
[00:41:14.911 --> 00:41:15.771]  Yeah, it's a dragon.
[00:41:16.151 --> 00:41:18.193]  That big green serpent coming up out of the ocean.
[00:41:18.854 --> 00:41:21.515]  With the red eyes, I mean... You must not have seen Police Day 2000.
[00:41:22.255 --> 00:41:23.035]  I didn't see Police Day 2000.
[00:41:23.396 --> 00:41:24.416]  That's exactly why I asked.
[00:41:24.436 --> 00:41:33.779]  I hadn't seen it in Road to Tyranny or Police Day 3, so... But also, I don't know what we're going to do with these late-night talk shows and all the other shows that are discrediting us.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:40.041]  You know, I was listening to Coast to Coast, and they're talking about... You know what they talk about.
[00:41:40.142 --> 00:41:42.422]  All this horrible nonsense.
[00:41:42.562 --> 00:41:44.243]  Chupacabra's going to get us.
[00:41:44.303 --> 00:41:45.063]  Exactly.
[00:41:45.303 --> 00:41:47.124]  But then they mention the Norfolk document.
[00:41:47.557 --> 00:41:48.717]  They mention new stuff like this.
[00:41:49.117 --> 00:41:50.258]  That makes us look horrible.
[00:41:50.638 --> 00:42:04.881]  Well, that's the tactic is that you have all this Chupacabra's flying saucers, Al-Qaeda's going to get us all this garbage, and they mix in the Northwoods plan, the U.S.
[00:42:05.281 --> 00:42:12.083]  government's official plan to carry out terror, and now the average person that heard it goes, oh, that's just that kooky stuff, but worse.
[00:42:13.263 --> 00:42:14.124]  Let me stop you.
[00:42:14.564 --> 00:42:15.964]  But worse, since you brought this up.
[00:42:16.707 --> 00:42:21.470]  But the worst thing is that the millions of listeners of that run around warning people.
[00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:22.631]  That's exactly why I brought it up.
[00:42:22.651 --> 00:42:25.432]  You have a government carried out 9-11, and there's goat devils.
[00:42:25.672 --> 00:42:27.073]  The goat devils run it.
[00:42:27.313 --> 00:42:28.534]  That's exactly why I brought it up.
[00:42:28.994 --> 00:42:34.298]  You know, I've actually encountered those type of people here on the street, and I don't know how to tackle that.
[00:42:34.498 --> 00:42:38.420]  I don't know how to explain to them, listen, what you're listening to is pure nonsense.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:44.244]  But then they'll tell me, well, the Northwest document is real, and you guys are mentioning true for Congress, but what are you talking about?
[00:42:44.264 --> 00:42:44.564]  I say, me?
[00:42:45.467 --> 00:42:46.148]  I never mentioned that.
[00:42:46.168 --> 00:42:47.769]  I don't believe in that, but they won't understand that.
[00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.452]  See, they think we're all part of the same group.
[00:42:50.492 --> 00:42:51.553]  Now, listen, I'm on the street.
[00:42:51.573 --> 00:42:55.017]  People run up, Alex, I'm telling you, in two months, Planet X will hit us.
[00:42:55.037 --> 00:42:55.757]  This is three years ago.
[00:42:55.797 --> 00:42:56.158]  Oh, please.
[00:42:56.698 --> 00:43:01.163]  And I tell them, I go, in three years, you're going to say that it was the Gregorian calendar was off.
[00:43:01.934 --> 00:43:04.956]  And the person approaches me three years later and goes, Gregorian calendar!
[00:43:05.156 --> 00:43:06.077]  It's two more months!
[00:43:06.257 --> 00:43:15.323]  And I go, I told you exactly what you'd say years ago, and here you are regurgitating it on me again.
[00:43:15.743 --> 00:43:16.283]  Stop it.
[00:43:16.664 --> 00:43:18.345]  I mean, I've got real stuff here.
[00:43:18.405 --> 00:43:21.207]  I talk about real things, and that's what they do.
[00:43:21.267 --> 00:43:21.967]  Here's the formula.
[00:43:22.407 --> 00:43:30.613]  Eight of the stories are chupacabras, yetis, cavemen, flying saucers, time machines...
[00:43:31.397 --> 00:43:32.017]  We're good to go.
[00:44:00.575 --> 00:44:01.136]  That's what it is.
[00:44:01.176 --> 00:44:03.119]  And Ashcroft and Bush are reptiles.
[00:44:03.159 --> 00:44:04.080]  And also, one more thing.
[00:44:05.622 --> 00:44:08.446]  Here in my local Fox division, teamed up with M.B.
[00:44:08.506 --> 00:44:09.447]  Liebman Furniture.
[00:44:10.248 --> 00:44:14.414]  They say, send your child's fingerprint and they'll give you an identification kit.
[00:44:16.127 --> 00:44:19.169]  I wonder what's that all about, and where are they doing this all over the country?
[00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:19.949]  They have that everywhere.
[00:44:19.989 --> 00:44:21.790]  Let's get a face scan of your child.
[00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:23.151]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:44:23.491 --> 00:44:26.593]  Come in and get a free piece of software if you do that.
[00:44:26.833 --> 00:44:31.095]  By the way, we don't mention that the government's paying us to get your child's digital photo.
[00:44:31.155 --> 00:44:32.396]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:44:33.036 --> 00:44:33.597]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:33.617 --> 00:44:34.837]  I appreciate it.
[00:44:35.117 --> 00:44:40.540]  I don't want to get off into all the theater that's on talk radio.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.122]  You've got fake neocons.
[00:44:44.577 --> 00:44:47.759]  Who are out there telling you gun control and open borders is conservatism.
[00:44:47.939 --> 00:44:49.120]  People are starting to see through that.
[00:44:49.961 --> 00:45:04.530]  But a lot of the people, and look, I think it's okay to talk about planets colliding or asteroids or could we live on Europa, you know, one of the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and is there life in space?
[00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:10.774]  And, you know, I've had a guest on before about SETI, you know, the Search for Extraterrestrial Life, you know, radio waves.
[00:45:11.034 --> 00:45:12.275]  I'm sure there's stuff out there.
[00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:16.445]  My whole point is, I deal with stuff I can prove.
[00:45:17.345 --> 00:45:20.546]  And I can prove the government's putting cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[00:45:21.626 --> 00:45:25.767]  I can prove that under Project Shad, they nerve-gassed and killed U.S.
[00:45:25.787 --> 00:45:27.648]  troops in England in the 1980s.
[00:45:28.408 --> 00:45:33.349]  I can prove they're putting AIDS virus in vaccines and injecting it in third world populations.
[00:45:33.889 --> 00:45:41.031]  I can prove an IMF World Bank plan from 1973 ordering the third world to sterilize half their women or they wouldn't get any loan guarantees.
[00:45:42.461 --> 00:45:47.183]  I can prove the forced sterilization of 400,000 women in this country for absolutely no reason.
[00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:53.626]  I can prove all of these horrible things that the government ships in the majority of the drugs.
[00:45:54.946 --> 00:45:56.627]  I can't prove chubacabras.
[00:45:57.047 --> 00:45:58.208]  I can't prove Bigfoots.
[00:45:58.368 --> 00:45:59.348]  I can't prove Atlantis.
[00:45:59.648 --> 00:46:06.071]  And I don't care about it because, folks, it isn't real because it doesn't affect us here, now, today.
[00:46:06.914 --> 00:46:13.416]  And this is how we've been co-opted by the New Age and the rest of it, and it sells because it's escapism.
[00:46:14.136 --> 00:46:15.617]  And people want escapism.
[00:46:15.877 --> 00:46:19.198]  They want to follow their phony preachers that tell them it's the end of the world every week.
[00:46:20.058 --> 00:46:24.499]  And they want to follow the kooks that tell them the aliens are about to attack.
[00:46:24.939 --> 00:46:28.240]  And they want to go along with this whole Rothschild-Rockefeller plan.
[00:46:29.521 --> 00:46:30.441]  I'm not going to be part of it.
[00:46:31.761 --> 00:46:33.762]  And yes, it's been admitted in the Kansas City Star.
[00:46:33.802 --> 00:46:34.362]  It's been admitted...
[00:46:35.504 --> 00:46:50.056]  In major papers, Wired Magazine, we have a whole chapter of this, An Order Out of Chaos, the new book I've published, that the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Carnegie Endowment, Bill Clinton's former chief of staff, they run the UFO movement.
[00:46:50.116 --> 00:46:52.278]  It is run by the government.
[00:46:52.939 --> 00:46:54.080]  This is admitted.
[00:46:55.421 --> 00:46:56.562]  All of this garbage is.
[00:46:56.862 --> 00:46:58.964]  It's a big distraction, a big diversion.
[00:46:59.344 --> 00:47:01.586]  And yes, folks, they've got it in the pike.
[00:47:02.904 --> 00:47:03.024]  Okay?
[00:47:03.044 --> 00:47:03.124]  Okay?
[00:47:32.478 --> 00:47:33.658]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:47:35.859 --> 00:47:40.941]  And I'm tired of having people run up to me on the street and tell me about a bunch of stuff that isn't documented.
[00:47:41.161 --> 00:47:44.162]  Well, this person said they're in contact with the aliens.
[00:47:44.562 --> 00:47:45.863]  Well, I heard that.
[00:47:46.523 --> 00:47:49.144]  And I'll ask them, how many people have you told about the aliens?
[00:47:49.844 --> 00:47:50.844]  I told 20 this week.
[00:47:51.144 --> 00:47:53.625]  And I bet you told them about the government being behind 9-11 too, didn't you?
[00:47:53.785 --> 00:47:54.626]  Well, of course I did.
[00:47:54.646 --> 00:47:56.086]  I got a worm about everything.
[00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:57.807]  You just discredit it to 20 people.
[00:47:59.272 --> 00:48:01.854]  And the 50 people, they'll tell about the kook they talked to.
[00:48:02.094 --> 00:48:10.420]  But if you'd have just told them about Northwoods, an admitted, declassified document, where the government said it was going to carry out terror, you could have saved this country.
[00:48:11.841 --> 00:48:15.043]  Let me tell you, it isn't going to be little green men that are coming to get you, folks.
[00:48:15.423 --> 00:48:18.966]  It's going to be men in black ski masks with Heckler & Koch submachine guns.
[00:48:19.826 --> 00:48:20.907]  That's what I'm worried about.
[00:48:22.205 --> 00:48:25.368]  Six-foot-one men in black ski masks kicking down doors.
[00:48:25.568 --> 00:48:26.268]  They're deadly.
[00:48:26.388 --> 00:48:27.469]  They come in the dead of the night.
[00:48:27.609 --> 00:48:28.690]  They abduct people.
[00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:30.131]  That's who I'm worried about.
[00:48:31.412 --> 00:48:38.938]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[00:48:39.218 --> 00:48:50.127]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:48:50.387 --> 00:48:53.229]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[00:50:03.284 --> 00:50:07.927]  Call Term Busters now.

[00:50:16.533 --> 00:50:21.977]  Remember, one million dollars in term life insurance coverage for as little as three dollars a day.
[00:50:22.077 --> 00:50:23.257]  Call right now.
[00:50:23.558 --> 00:50:24.098]  Operators,
[00:50:24.558 --> 00:50:35.929]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:40.534]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:40.694 --> 00:50:45.078]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:45.118 --> 00:50:46.460]  The New World Order.
[00:50:48.221 --> 00:50:52.466]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:52.526 --> 00:50:59.454]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:50:59.594 --> 00:51:01.597]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:01.977 --> 00:51:12.401]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:12.581 --> 00:51:17.943]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:18.443 --> 00:51:21.144]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:51:21.224 --> 00:51:21.785]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:21.825 --> 00:51:22.225]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:22.245 --> 00:51:23.505]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:51:36.224 --> 00:51:38.145]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:38.626 --> 00:51:41.468]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:42.648 --> 00:51:53.716]  All right, I said I would get some more of the news this hour, and I covered some of it, but as usual, I got all into discussions with callers and interesting areas that we could expound on or I could rant and rave on.
[00:51:56.661 --> 00:52:12.686]  For everybody that's patiently holding, like Israel and Jay and Kevin and Phyllis and Gene and Charlie and everybody, we're going to get to you, but I'm going to have to cover news for 15, 20 minutes or so and then get into it, and I hope you all stay right there because I've got to get into this.
[00:52:12.746 --> 00:52:14.426]  It's all just way too important.
[00:52:16.727 --> 00:52:25.750]  And the whole issue of mixing disinformation in with real things we can prove is a government tactic all the way.
[00:52:27.558 --> 00:52:30.580]  Also, people seem to like rumor more than they like facts.
[00:52:31.101 --> 00:52:36.725]  I mean, the Rocky Mountain News reported last year that they got incinerators and mass graves ready for you.
[00:52:36.745 --> 00:52:38.307]  That's pretty scary.
[00:52:38.347 --> 00:52:39.407]  Let's just ignore that.
[00:52:39.447 --> 00:52:40.849]  Let's not talk a lot about that.
[00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:45.933]  SWAT teams every day busting in the wrong house, shooting innocent people every day.
[00:52:46.933 --> 00:52:47.514]  That doesn't matter.
[00:52:47.554 --> 00:52:48.775]  Let's talk about little green men.
[00:52:49.395 --> 00:52:50.636]  Take a whole industry out of it.
[00:52:52.217 --> 00:52:54.059]  Look at how the government pushes it and peddles it.
[00:52:54.579 --> 00:52:55.220]  I'm sick of it.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.621]  I'm tired of it.
[00:52:57.236 --> 00:52:58.136]  We're losing this country.
[00:52:58.156 --> 00:53:05.620]  I mean, my article I wrote, DARPA, Engineering the Beast System, that's a lot scarier, folks, than Little Green Men, and it's real.
[00:53:09.842 --> 00:53:12.463]  Coming up, I will cover these articles before we go to the calls.
[00:53:12.663 --> 00:53:14.384]  Two killed in Iraq blast.
[00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:17.065]  Foxman at the ADL.
[00:53:17.105 --> 00:53:18.745]  Gibson spewing anti-Semitism.
[00:53:18.946 --> 00:53:19.366]  Wow.
[00:53:20.486 --> 00:53:22.087]  Also, Harvard says that if you quote
[00:53:22.717 --> 00:53:24.058]  Want to fight a new world order?
[00:53:24.118 --> 00:53:25.078]  You are with Al-Qaeda.
[00:53:25.639 --> 00:53:28.220]  Yeah, this is from the Harvard Gazette, folks.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.220]  You don't like the new world order?
[00:53:29.681 --> 00:53:31.121]  You're secretly an Al-Qaeda member.
[00:53:31.161 --> 00:53:33.463]  Yeah, Al-Qaeda controls everybody.
[00:53:33.483 --> 00:53:34.043]  Who's against it?
[00:53:34.643 --> 00:53:36.904]  IMF warns trade gap could bring down the dollar.
[00:53:36.984 --> 00:53:37.985]  I want to go back over that.
[00:53:38.325 --> 00:53:40.606]  Clinton persuaded Hillary to run for president.
[00:53:41.026 --> 00:53:42.227]  Get into Wesley Clark.
[00:53:44.028 --> 00:53:45.969]  Bush is losing support on the right.
[00:53:46.624 --> 00:53:47.844]  This is out of the Star Tribune.
[00:53:47.884 --> 00:53:49.385]  Turns out that's where he's really losing his support.
[00:53:49.405 --> 00:53:50.725]  He's got a lot of Democrats supporting him.
[00:53:50.985 --> 00:53:52.365]  Well, yeah, they're finally waking up.
[00:53:52.385 --> 00:53:53.186]  He's a socialist.
[00:53:54.046 --> 00:53:55.206]  But he's losing that also.
[00:53:55.246 --> 00:53:59.127]  White House is ambushed by criticism from America's military community.
[00:53:59.927 --> 00:54:01.628]  LBJ killed JFK.
[00:54:01.648 --> 00:54:07.529]  This is from Bush's press secretary's father, who was in the government at the time.
[00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:12.370]  And he said, out coming forward, he says, now that he's older and doesn't care if they kill him.
[00:54:13.151 --> 00:54:14.951]  He's right here in Austin, Texas, by the way.
[00:54:16.645 --> 00:54:18.066]  Also, yeah, we'll be getting to that.
[00:54:18.667 --> 00:54:26.452]  Also, another article, Venezuelan military intelligence says overwhelming evidence that CIA plan to bring down their president's airplane and round the United Nations in New York.
[00:54:27.172 --> 00:54:29.354]  Russia's spies plot to kill tycoon in Britain.
[00:54:29.374 --> 00:54:33.056]  We'll tell you why, because he exposed that Putin was behind the bombings.
[00:54:33.476 --> 00:54:36.218]  Pregnant teens death under investigation after taking RU-486.
[00:54:39.477 --> 00:54:42.358]  That's just some of what I'll cover right when we start this next hour.
[00:54:42.378 --> 00:54:48.359]  I'll go right through this for 10-15 minutes, then we'll go to the loaded phones here and talk to all you great people out there.
[00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:54.040]  Now, before I go any further, end of the hour, you need to support the show, but that's secondary.
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:55:01.461]  You need to get Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order, because it's such a good book, because it exposes the UFO movement.
[00:55:01.481 --> 00:55:02.942]  That's just one of the chapters in the 334 pages.
[00:55:05.071 --> 00:55:06.612]  You need to get my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:55:06.712 --> 00:55:10.195]  Excellent as well, covering government-sponsored terror and 9-11 and the police state.
[00:55:10.576 --> 00:55:12.797]  You need to get my films on September 11th.
[00:55:12.817 --> 00:55:14.679]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:14.979 --> 00:55:16.480]  Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror.
[00:55:16.801 --> 00:55:18.642]  Now there's police state free total enslavement.
[00:55:19.122 --> 00:55:22.145]  You need to go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:22.165 --> 00:55:24.006]  You need to stop sitting around.
[00:55:24.026 --> 00:55:28.190]  You need to get this real, documented, hardcore info and get it out to people.
[00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:30.872]  Great gifts for Christmas or birthdays.
[00:55:31.554 --> 00:55:32.355]  Make copies.
[00:55:32.895 --> 00:55:33.755]  Give it to your neighbors.
[00:55:33.775 --> 00:55:34.836]  Get it on AXS TV.
[00:55:34.876 --> 00:55:35.897]  I want to thank those that have.
[00:55:35.917 --> 00:55:36.377]  Keep it up.
[00:55:37.618 --> 00:55:38.858]  Toll-free number to order.
[00:55:38.918 --> 00:55:39.759]  Call right now.
[00:55:39.859 --> 00:55:40.819]  Don't wait, folks.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.242]  That person you wake up may cause the chain reaction that brings this system down.
[00:55:45.282 --> 00:55:46.683]  We're very close to winning.
[00:55:46.723 --> 00:55:50.505]  That's why we're in such a dangerous situation right now in a death grip with the New World Order.
[00:55:51.025 --> 00:55:52.006]  Toll-free number to order.
[00:55:52.046 --> 00:55:52.566]  Here it is.
[00:55:52.586 --> 00:55:52.646]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.350]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:05.333]  Printfulwars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[00:56:05.353 --> 00:56:06.053]  Don't wait.
[00:56:06.073 --> 00:56:06.114]  888-253-3139.
[00:56:06.154 --> 00:56:09.636]  Globalists are counting on you not getting these videos.
[00:56:09.656 --> 00:56:10.036]  Take action.
[00:56:10.476 --> 00:56:11.937]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:21.491 --> 00:56:22.211]  Hello, folks.
[00:56:22.231 --> 00:56:29.075]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[00:56:29.315 --> 00:56:32.277]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded.
[00:56:35.418 --> 00:56:38.120]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.974 --> 00:56:50.337]  All right, listen up and listen up real good.
[00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:16.373]  We're back live.
[00:57:16.433 --> 00:57:17.254]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:57:18.114 --> 00:57:19.736]  And we're under attack, my friends.
[00:57:20.577 --> 00:57:22.359]  The good news is a lot of people are waking up.
[00:57:22.419 --> 00:57:23.640]  The globalists are aware of that.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:38.094]  They're trying to carry out terror attacks, economic attacks, attacks on our psychology, our spirits, our souls, by trying to turn us into a degraded, mindless society of jabbering heathen.
[00:57:40.456 --> 00:57:45.518]  All right, I'm going to cover news for two segments, then I'm going to go to calls for the balance of und broadcast.
[00:57:46.418 --> 00:57:49.339]  And the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:53.461]  Everybody stay right there, because I'm going to get to you coming up here pretty quick.
[00:57:54.561 --> 00:58:00.544]  In assassination news, LBJ killed JFK.
[00:58:01.084 --> 00:58:02.164]  Of course he did.
[00:58:03.265 --> 00:58:05.045]  That is, he was involved in it.
[00:58:05.406 --> 00:58:06.906]  I've had his mistress on the show.
[00:58:06.926 --> 00:58:08.907]  Before she died, he even had his son.
[00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:10.290]  We're good to go.
[00:58:36.901 --> 00:58:45.904]  Mr. Harrelson, Woody Harrelson's father, is in a federal prison right now for shooting a judge with a .243 in the throat at 400 yards away.
[00:58:45.944 --> 00:58:46.904]  That's not easy to do.
[00:58:46.924 --> 00:58:50.726]  He's in federal prison right now.
[00:58:50.786 --> 00:59:04.590]  Well, I mean, I've got a Dallas Times-Herald, now defunct, photo of him being arrested in a disheveled outfit over there at the little railway station right behind the grassy knoll.
[00:59:05.259 --> 00:59:11.101]  Police took him into custody, found rifles, but that was all shut down real quick, and it was totally staged, folks.
[00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.402]  You're going, Woody Harrelson's dad?
[00:59:13.502 --> 00:59:16.382]  Yeah, truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:59:16.643 --> 00:59:24.385]  I mean, he's just one of the shooters, but I've been told by folks that were in and around all this that he was the guy that made the headshot.
[00:59:27.669 --> 00:59:30.172]  But continuing, and you ask, well, why is he in prison today?
[00:59:30.212 --> 00:59:31.713]  Well, I mean, he was a freelance killer.
[00:59:31.773 --> 00:59:33.415]  The CIA just doesn't go out and use its own people.
[00:59:33.455 --> 00:59:37.739]  It hires intermediaries, subgroups of people.
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.803]  LBJ killed JFK.
[00:59:40.983 --> 00:59:43.145]  Theory embarrasses Bush aide.
[00:59:43.806 --> 00:59:46.028]  This is the London Times, highly respected.
[00:59:47.156 --> 01:00:05.143]  When President George W. Bush was looking for a new White House spokesman to replace Ari Fleischer, last July he turned to his close circle of Texas friends for an ally he knew to be loyal, discreet, and uncontroversial, writes Tony Allen Mills.
[01:00:06.388 --> 01:00:18.133]  Few in the White House press corps expected political fireworks when the president chose Scott McLennan, a longtime Bush supporter who had been Fleischer's deputy and was renowned for his unassuming manner.
[01:00:18.193 --> 01:00:23.975]  McLennan's brother marked a senior administration official, and their mother is a former mayor of Austin.
[01:00:25.484 --> 01:00:26.165]  We're good to go.
[01:00:46.963 --> 01:00:55.145]  After 40 years of rabid conspiracy theorizing over JFK's murder in Dallas, it's a conspiracy to say one bullet did that.
[01:00:55.165 --> 01:01:00.266]  I know for those of you that don't know guns, you can believe whatever they tell you, but believe me, folks, it's a joke.
[01:01:00.807 --> 01:01:01.467]  Lone bullet.
[01:01:02.047 --> 01:01:04.868]  The older McLennan claims to have found a new culprit.
[01:01:05.468 --> 01:01:06.748]  Edward Clark, a former U.S.
[01:01:06.808 --> 01:01:10.289]  ambassador to Australia and close political ally of Johnson.
[01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:18.760]  And he details witnesses and people and how he's known about this all these years from attorney-client privilege, and of course he's worked with different White Houses.
[01:01:20.281 --> 01:01:22.122]  I mean, everybody knows, folks.
[01:01:22.422 --> 01:01:29.884]  It's like saying the moon's made out of cheese to say that one guy, Lee Harvey Oswald, did that.
[01:01:31.885 --> 01:01:34.666]  You talk to police snipers, they'll laugh.
[01:01:34.686 --> 01:01:39.908]  I mean, anybody that's ever had any practice with a gun knows it's just ridiculous.
[01:01:39.928 --> 01:01:40.688]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:43.843 --> 01:01:47.746]  Have you found your business isn't quite as profitable as it was before the economy went south?
[01:01:48.206 --> 01:01:50.247]  Are new clients a little harder to come by lately?
[01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:51.708]  Well, maybe we can help.

[01:01:59.914 --> 01:02:01.695]  It's not by coincidence, it's by design.

[01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:11.581]  We're good to go.
[01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:46.148]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:46.328 --> 01:02:50.755]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:50.915 --> 01:02:55.282]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:02:55.322 --> 01:02:56.684]  The New World Order.
[01:02:58.446 --> 01:03:02.669]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:03:02.729 --> 01:03:09.673]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:03:09.793 --> 01:03:11.855]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:03:12.175 --> 01:03:22.502]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:03:22.802 --> 01:03:28.184]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:03:28.665 --> 01:03:31.286]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:03:31.306 --> 01:03:31.886]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:03:32.446 --> 01:03:33.727]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:03:42.498 --> 01:03:45.779]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:04:07.605 --> 01:04:08.106]  We're good to go.
[01:04:33.065 --> 01:04:36.686]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:40.228]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:04:43.869 --> 01:04:49.891]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:50.491 --> 01:04:53.472]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:55.709 --> 01:05:04.871]  The New York Stock Exchange chairman, Richard Grasso, got a $5 million bonus on 9-1-1 for leadership.
[01:05:04.972 --> 01:05:05.972]  Oh, I'd say so.
[01:05:07.432 --> 01:05:12.053]  All that insider trading leading back to his buddies in the CIA, that story's gone.
[01:05:13.234 --> 01:05:15.834]  And he got a total of $139 million.
[01:05:15.934 --> 01:05:18.695]  That's his little bonuses over the last few years.
[01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:21.396]  Man, that's a pretty good paying job.
[01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:30.112]  And I'll say he'll keep his mouth shut now with that nice little payout for running the stock exchange.
[01:05:32.653 --> 01:05:34.494]  Running the casino, folks.
[01:05:34.534 --> 01:05:35.754]  I don't know why I'm getting back into that.
[01:05:35.774 --> 01:05:40.735]  I just look at this photo of him in 99 with the head of the Communist Party gorilla hugging him.
[01:05:40.755 --> 01:05:45.557]  And the news admitted he was down there to tell him to launder his money through the New York Stock Exchange.
[01:05:45.877 --> 01:05:47.037]  Did you know that's legal?
[01:05:48.018 --> 01:05:48.798]  Yeah, it is!
[01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:51.702]  Now look at Richard Grasso.
[01:05:51.722 --> 01:05:53.583]  He looks like such a nice man.
[01:05:55.024 --> 01:05:56.685]  Such a good person.
[01:05:56.705 --> 01:06:00.228]  I just love this photo of him.
[01:06:00.308 --> 01:06:01.849]  It's $139.5 million.
[01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:03.250]  I'm sorry.
[01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:05.371]  That's what their minions get.
[01:06:05.812 --> 01:06:06.952]  He's just a little pimp.
[01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:11.315]  And what is it?
[01:06:11.355 --> 01:06:12.696]  I just had the article a few weeks ago.
[01:06:12.756 --> 01:06:17.920]  The last 15 New York Stock Exchange chairmen, 10 have been deputy directors recently.
[01:06:18.786 --> 01:06:19.867]  Of the CIA.
[01:06:19.907 --> 01:06:21.307]  It's like, that's the position.
[01:06:21.667 --> 01:06:26.770]  You get deputy director, your payout for all the great work you do is later you get to sit in the New York Stock Exchange.
[01:06:30.411 --> 01:06:35.434]  I mean, folks, it's getting sicker and sicker and sicker by the minute.
[01:06:37.235 --> 01:06:37.715]  But look at this.
[01:06:37.895 --> 01:06:39.936]  LBJ killed JFK.
[01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:44.598]  And Scott McLennan's daddy, the White House press secretary's daddy,
[01:06:46.694 --> 01:06:55.357]  Has come out, and this is out of the London Times, and he says that, where's the quote here?
[01:06:55.818 --> 01:06:57.018]  I knew him very well.
[01:06:57.918 --> 01:07:00.299]  LBJ was brutal, McClendon Sr.
[01:07:00.439 --> 01:07:00.739]  said.
[01:07:00.759 --> 01:07:10.883]  He said that LBJ knew that Kennedy was going to remove him off the ticket, and so he had Kennedy killed.
[01:07:10.943 --> 01:07:12.624]  Well, I mean, sure, he green-lighted it,
[01:07:15.461 --> 01:07:17.242]  It's not like LBJ was running anything.
[01:07:18.563 --> 01:07:22.405]  You talk about a criminal, just a criminal's criminal.
[01:07:23.346 --> 01:07:24.406]  That was LBJ.
[01:07:24.466 --> 01:07:27.428]  He was the most vicious, hateful.
[01:07:29.409 --> 01:07:31.911]  I mean, there have been books, mainstream books written about him.
[01:07:32.551 --> 01:07:38.174]  He totally blackmailed the university down in San Marcos, Southwest.
[01:07:38.214 --> 01:07:39.555]  He ran the whole thing.
[01:07:39.595 --> 01:07:42.377]  He had blackmail on the dean and the president and
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:47.542]  This guy, everywhere he went, he would just grab people and command them about.
[01:07:48.983 --> 01:07:50.303]  He was something else, folks.
[01:07:50.823 --> 01:07:52.924]  They got so mad when I had his mistress on.
[01:07:53.524 --> 01:07:56.846]  The LPJ family just hates my guts.
[01:07:57.566 --> 01:07:58.407]  And that's good.
[01:07:58.447 --> 01:07:59.387]  I'm glad you do.
[01:07:59.407 --> 01:08:01.748]  I'm glad you do.
[01:08:02.428 --> 01:08:03.589]  Right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:08:03.649 --> 01:08:06.490]  Because you people make me sick.
[01:08:10.132 --> 01:08:10.872]  And here's another one.
[01:08:12.245 --> 01:08:17.008]  This is out of one of the big newspapers in Venezuela.
[01:08:17.028 --> 01:08:19.869]  The website is vheadline.com.
[01:08:19.909 --> 01:08:22.971]  It's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:08:23.231 --> 01:08:32.696]  Venezuelan military intelligence says, overwhelming evidence, the CIA planned to bring down Chavez's airplane en route to the United Nations in New York.
[01:08:34.036 --> 01:08:39.859]  Now remember, we had Greg Palast on five days before the attempted coup when they kidnapped him.
[01:08:39.879 --> 01:08:40.680]  And we're going to kill him.
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:41.040]  Remember that?
[01:08:42.563 --> 01:08:45.404]  We had Palestine.
[01:08:45.424 --> 01:08:52.948]  He said, you watch, there will be a coup within a month there because he's letting the oil flow and won't pay the IMF and World Bank money back that's not owed them.
[01:08:54.109 --> 01:08:59.712]  The tale is behind the sudden decision to cancel President Hugo Chavez's next trip to Washington, D.C.
[01:09:00.052 --> 01:09:04.314]  and New York to deliver the speech the United Nations are being revealed by security services.
[01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:14.701]  Who say they have been overwhelmed by the evidence of a CIA-backed plan to bring down the Chavez-Tries airplane during the scheduled flight to the United States from Caracas.
[01:09:15.542 --> 01:09:31.154]  Sources in Venezuela's military intelligence directorate, DIM, have told the headline that presented with overwhelming evidence of Washington's planned attack on the president's flight was decided that the president's personal security was permanent and that he should not go.
[01:09:33.482 --> 01:09:36.804]  Well, yeah, they've already kidnapped him once, and we're going to kill him.
[01:09:37.085 --> 01:09:41.307]  And when they got caught about the killing, they go, oh, we were saving him from guerrillas.
[01:09:41.327 --> 01:09:44.610]  There's another one.
[01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:47.372]  Russian spies plot to kill tycoon in Britain.
[01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:48.532]  London Times.
[01:09:49.153 --> 01:09:55.397]  And the article goes on to admit that other Russian defectors have been killed in the House of Commons.
[01:09:57.178 --> 01:09:59.960]  Got tri-killed by MI6 when they don't like information coming out.
[01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:00.901]  I mean, they...
[01:10:01.909 --> 01:10:05.152]  Other people, it lists their names, have been killed when they're about to go in and testify.
[01:10:06.934 --> 01:10:16.064]  Russian KGB will walk over, slash MI6, and have a little poison dart into their finger and just barely scratch them, and they die right there, fall over and die.
[01:10:16.724 --> 01:10:24.072]  And Boris Berevosky, the big media tycoon, was about to go in and testify, and now they admitted they had to pull him out because they found out that, well...
[01:10:25.533 --> 01:10:26.914]  You want to find out why that's happening?
[01:10:26.954 --> 01:10:27.595]  Go to prisonplanet.com.
[01:10:52.159 --> 01:11:03.447]  And we have the assassination of Russia, a 48-minute video, where they have the FSB in the news clips admitting Putin carried out the bombings there, and that's now admitted, blowing stuff up to blame it on his political enemies.
[01:11:04.227 --> 01:11:06.829]  So quite a bit of assassination news there for you today.
[01:11:06.849 --> 01:11:11.973]  A lot of days I have assassination sections or segments on the websites.
[01:11:11.993 --> 01:11:12.553]  I never get to it.
[01:11:12.573 --> 01:11:16.836]  But I figured today we might just get into that stack of assassination news.
[01:11:19.156 --> 01:11:22.900]  White House is ambushed by criticism from America's military community.
[01:11:24.401 --> 01:11:25.162]  London Independent.
[01:11:25.908 --> 01:11:33.692]  George Bush probably owes his presidency to the absentee military voters who nudged his tally in Florida decisively past Al Gore's.
[01:11:33.972 --> 01:11:48.098]  But now, with Iraq in chaos and the reasoning for going to war, they're mired in controversy and increasingly disgruntled military poses perhaps the greatest immediate threat to his political future just one year before the presidential elections.
[01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:49.699]  Uh-uh!
[01:11:49.719 --> 01:11:51.780]  Because I got another article here.
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:54.661]  It says, quote, CIA runs America's voting machines.
[01:11:55.566 --> 01:12:06.352]  Well, yeah, I read the analysis of it and what the plane dealer recorded in those meetings with the industry and all the, again, CIA directors and deputy directors that run the touchscreen companies.
[01:12:07.193 --> 01:12:08.994]  And we don't have elections anymore, folks.
[01:12:09.114 --> 01:12:10.235]  By and large, they're gone.
[01:12:10.255 --> 01:12:15.718]  I know that's scary and wild to hear, but we've got to go ahead and admit the full horror of this.
[01:12:17.899 --> 01:12:19.119]  So that's coming up, too.
[01:12:19.199 --> 01:12:21.120]  Bush is losing support on the right.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.580]  This is out of the Star Tribune.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.901]  The criticism of President Bush aren't surprising.
[01:12:25.981 --> 01:12:28.242]  He's bungling the war in Iraq.
[01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:30.202]  His budget deficits are disastrous.
[01:12:30.242 --> 01:12:31.663]  He's crambling civil liberties.
[01:12:31.683 --> 01:12:33.743]  His spending plans are misguided.
[01:12:34.023 --> 01:12:39.245]  But the source of those criticisms is they're increasingly coming from conservatives.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:52.245]  And it goes on to say, Think Tank studies op-ed columns, talk radio callers, and opinion polls show conservatives' disenchantment with Bush's policies and priorities has been climbing.
[01:12:53.586 --> 01:12:54.266]  Well, yeah.
[01:12:55.426 --> 01:12:55.827]  Let me see.
[01:12:55.867 --> 01:13:01.389]  I've done 1,200-something interviews in the last two years and ten days.
[01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:07.232]  I quit counting at 1,000, and I've done over 200 in the last few months since I hit 1,000.
[01:13:08.639 --> 01:13:13.064]  I can be on liberal shows, conservative shows, you name it.
[01:13:14.345 --> 01:13:17.569]  Every caller, George Bush is a terrorist, the government carried out the attacks.
[01:13:17.609 --> 01:13:18.590]  Yes, I agree with you.
[01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:21.593]  On and on and on and on and on.
[01:13:22.594 --> 01:13:23.675]  You're in a lot of trouble.
[01:13:24.816 --> 01:13:26.959]  So go ahead, government, blow some more stuff up.
[01:13:27.219 --> 01:13:29.461]  I hope you don't kill a bunch of people, but you probably will.
[01:13:29.501 --> 01:13:30.122]  You can't help it.
[01:13:31.443 --> 01:13:34.245]  You're wearing out the effect of your terrorism.
[01:13:34.645 --> 01:13:38.067]  Government-sponsored terrorism is being exposed.
[01:13:38.188 --> 01:13:40.809]  And all over the world, it's top story now.
[01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:43.511]  And the American people are starting to figure it out.
[01:13:43.551 --> 01:13:44.431]  Now, I want to make it clear.
[01:13:46.192 --> 01:13:48.094]  And I predicted this over a year and a half ago.
[01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:50.135]  They're going to let it all come out about September 11th.
[01:13:53.109 --> 01:13:54.510]  That's why they leaked Northwoods.
[01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:55.830]  That's why they brought all this stuff out.
[01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:57.811]  That's why they put out ridiculous stories.
[01:13:57.831 --> 01:13:59.912]  That's why they flew Taliban and al-Qaeda out to safety.
[01:14:00.153 --> 01:14:05.235]  That's why they allowed the Dallas Morning News to admit that Bush's business partners were the Bin Ladens and vacations with them.
[01:14:06.016 --> 01:14:08.197]  Because they're going to blame it on conservatism.
[01:14:08.937 --> 01:14:11.778]  This is going to be the final end of conservatism in America.
[01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:13.339]  Bush is the Trojan horse.
[01:14:13.759 --> 01:14:18.862]  The Judas Iscariot is to take the conservative movement down and bash its brains out.
[01:14:20.716 --> 01:14:30.121]  Bush is energizing a mammoth left-wing backlash that, when it surges, is going to overtake the entire country and destroy America.
[01:14:32.162 --> 01:14:37.184]  It's going to make the EU and the UN and the IMF and the World Bank, they're all playing the part of the good cops.
[01:14:37.304 --> 01:14:38.825]  Bush plays the part of the bad cop.
[01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:46.307]  And he's energizing a huge leftist, communistic movement against him.
[01:14:46.827 --> 01:15:04.339]  And Bush will step out of the way, and like a rampaging bull, angered by the sight of a red cape, the enraged leviathan of the left wing, with all its corporate backing, will run right past Bush and right over what's left of America, like a freight train, just absolutely smashing us.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:10.383]  Again, it's just endless problem-reaction solution, rolling one crisis into another.
[01:15:11.164 --> 01:15:16.286]  They carry out the attacks, the legislation passed, destroy our liberties to get us to go and take over all these countries.
[01:15:16.606 --> 01:15:18.987]  Then that creates a problem with the globalists because folks wake up.
[01:15:19.307 --> 01:15:20.108]  They already knew that.
[01:15:20.188 --> 01:15:22.529]  They then roll that into, okay, America's bad.
[01:15:22.569 --> 01:15:23.969]  Yeah, terrorists do run it.
[01:15:23.989 --> 01:15:25.090]  The government is terroristic.
[01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:29.872]  See, we need a world government to keep these countries in line and this aggressive empire that's America.
[01:15:31.732 --> 01:15:32.973]  And that's what's coming out of all this.
[01:15:33.013 --> 01:15:33.693]  That's the plan.
[01:15:35.094 --> 01:15:35.814]  That's what they're doing.
[01:15:35.874 --> 01:15:38.175]  I mean, are you sophisticated enough to figure this out?
[01:15:38.755 --> 01:15:40.596]  I told you they'd hang Bush out to dry.
[01:15:42.868 --> 01:15:47.409]  I told you this show served the New World Order unless you consciously understood this.
[01:15:51.731 --> 01:15:52.491]  We talked about it.
[01:15:54.051 --> 01:15:55.472]  Talked about it long and hard.
[01:15:57.412 --> 01:15:59.333]  And now, exactly as we said, it's happening.
[01:15:59.613 --> 01:16:01.634]  The UN's going to go into Iraq as the savior.
[01:16:02.274 --> 01:16:04.294]  Bush is going to be tarred and feathered in the news.
[01:16:05.015 --> 01:16:06.435]  And then when there's a Democrat in office...
[01:16:07.671 --> 01:16:15.034]  When there's a Democrat in office, you watch, they're not going to repeal Patriot Act 1 or 2, or Victory Acts, or all the face-scanning cameras, and they're going to be just like Bush.
[01:16:15.254 --> 01:16:16.394]  They're going to want open borders.
[01:16:17.294 --> 01:16:18.135]  What do we do then?
[01:16:18.335 --> 01:16:19.235]  Who do we vote for?
[01:16:19.255 --> 01:16:20.195]  That's the point.
[01:16:20.235 --> 01:16:21.356]  There is no more voting.
[01:16:24.377 --> 01:16:29.278]  They control the election through the selection of the candidates they put out there and give attention to.
[01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:33.420]  They control it at that level, and they also are now...
[01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:39.874]  Heading us off at the pass in case we wake up and putting in the touchscreen voting that's publicly run by the CIA!

[01:18:42.524 --> 01:18:47.247]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:18:47.527 --> 01:18:48.208]  Yes, it's true.
[01:18:48.288 --> 01:18:50.969]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.

[01:20:43.431 --> 01:20:48.573]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:49.233 --> 01:20:51.614]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:20:54.695 --> 01:20:56.035]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:56.215 --> 01:20:57.396]  We'll go to your calls now.
[01:20:58.656 --> 01:21:00.377]  And then I want to get back into the election.
[01:21:00.677 --> 01:21:09.120]  And, well, Harvard's saying that if you don't believe in a new world order, if you're against it, that, quote, you're with Al Qaeda.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.241]  I have this from the Harvard University Gazette.
[01:21:13.684 --> 01:21:18.166]  And also what the ADL is doing to Mel Gibson.
[01:21:18.266 --> 01:21:20.647]  I mean, I think it's going to backfire on them, folks.
[01:21:21.507 --> 01:21:23.708]  We'll get more into the dollars plunge as well.
[01:21:23.748 --> 01:21:25.489]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:21:25.529 --> 01:21:29.990]  I did want to add one more little tidbit about Bush, just boiling it down simply.
[01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:33.312]  Bush isn't a real conservative.
[01:21:33.372 --> 01:21:42.295]  He's a neocon meant to bring us to the altar of the New World Order while putting out a bunch of phony conservative rhetoric to smokescreen a lot of good conservatives in this country.
[01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:52.621]  As the world is shown the corruption of America, America is getting the blame and Bush is getting the blame, hence conservatism is getting the blame.
[01:21:53.541 --> 01:22:03.423]  And out of this, like a judo move, the globalists are going to use that counter-backlash against the New World Order offensive to actually use it to push the New World Order even further forward.
[01:22:04.563 --> 01:22:10.124]  You understand they're building up this big backlash against Bush, whereas it should be against the New World Order.
[01:22:10.965 --> 01:22:13.085]  And they'll build up a backlash against the Democrats.
[01:22:13.735 --> 01:22:15.576]  After that, and bring in another Republican.
[01:22:15.676 --> 01:22:17.357]  This is how the New World Order moves forward.
[01:22:18.078 --> 01:22:21.900]  And if we don't grow up and get the real political system, we're going to lose our freedoms.
[01:22:22.841 --> 01:22:24.522]  All right, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:22:24.542 --> 01:22:26.683]  I want to thank folks for holding.
[01:22:27.104 --> 01:22:28.685]  Jay in California, go ahead.
[01:22:28.705 --> 01:22:30.245]  Hey, Alex.
[01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:33.287]  I just had an audio clip I'm going to play for you.
[01:22:33.307 --> 01:22:35.449]  It was Chris Matthews, Hardball.
[01:22:36.169 --> 01:22:40.512]  And they had Congressman Kurt Weldon, Pennsylvania, I guess the Republicans,
[01:22:41.252 --> 01:22:47.235]  And I guess they had a clip on there about Ted Kennedy complaining about how Clinton went into Yugoslavia and everything.
[01:22:48.275 --> 01:22:49.796]  And, you know, under false pretenses.
[01:22:49.976 --> 01:22:55.658]  And then, you know, because, you know, they were... Kennedy was actually complaining about Iraq, sorry.
[01:22:56.238 --> 01:22:58.279]  And this guy came back about Yugoslavia.
[01:22:58.299 --> 01:22:59.900]  And I'm going to play this little clip for you if I can.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:03.401]  Well, if you do, you've got to turn your TV way up and have the phone by it.
[01:23:03.801 --> 01:23:04.202]  Okay.
[01:23:04.242 --> 01:23:05.982]  I'll see how this works.
[01:23:06.042 --> 01:23:07.283]  I can't do this every day, folks.
[01:23:08.024 --> 01:23:10.546]  Okay, I sent you the transcript, too, in case this doesn't come out good.
[01:23:10.586 --> 01:23:11.567]  Okay, thanks a million.
[01:23:11.587 --> 01:23:11.987]  Go ahead.
[01:23:12.187 --> 01:23:13.328]  It was on Friday the 19th.
[01:23:16.051 --> 01:23:29.261]  Very well, and first, Congressman, is it possible, is there any truth to what Kennedy's saying about the fact that $2.5 billion a month is being pulled out of the defense budget and being secreted over to these other governments so that they'll put their troops in the field?
[01:23:29.762 --> 01:23:31.383]  Chris, that's an outrageous statement.
[01:23:31.904 --> 01:23:33.525]  Senator Kennedy wants to talk about fraud.
[01:23:33.545 --> 01:23:34.786]  He ought to talk about chappaquiddick.
[01:23:35.305 --> 01:23:38.768]  We're going to talk about what he and President Clinton told us in 1999.
[01:23:39.168 --> 01:23:43.412]  When they told us to bomb innocent serves, we'd find 100,000 mass graves.
[01:23:43.772 --> 01:23:45.274]  Those mass graves were never found.
[01:23:45.674 --> 01:23:49.657]  They lied to the American people to justify the aerial bombardment campaign.
[01:23:49.897 --> 01:23:54.762]  In fact, during the 90s, Chris, there were 38 deployments of our troops by President Clinton.
[01:23:55.002 --> 01:23:59.826]  In every one of those cases, unlike Desert Storm where President Bush got us reimbursed,
[01:24:00.296 --> 01:24:07.322]  In every one of those 38 deployments, we paid other countries for the cost of their troops to come in and fight alongside of ours.
[01:24:07.602 --> 01:24:10.505]  It was totally unlike what we did back in Desert Storm.
[01:24:11.025 --> 01:24:17.891]  Yeah, that's a great clip, and thanks for doing that, Jay, but I would add a point to that.
[01:24:18.872 --> 01:24:22.175]  Again, just what I just said before we went to the caller and the clip.
[01:24:22.956 --> 01:24:24.157]  That's exactly what they do.
[01:24:25.057 --> 01:24:28.120]  Well, Bill Clinton was corrupt, so what if we're corrupt?
[01:24:28.726 --> 01:24:30.948]  And then the Democrats say, well, Bush did it.
[01:24:30.988 --> 01:24:31.909]  What's wrong with us?
[01:24:31.989 --> 01:24:32.809]  It's an agenda.
[01:24:32.849 --> 01:24:34.110]  They all vote together.
[01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:36.692]  The Republicans voted for going into Serbia.
[01:24:37.153 --> 01:24:39.054]  The Democrats voted for going into Iraq.
[01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:46.780]  It's all just a stage political bickering, the equivalent of going and watching a Macbeth play or something.
[01:24:47.761 --> 01:24:49.843]  I mean, it's not real, folks.
[01:24:49.883 --> 01:24:52.065]  It's Shakespearean theater.
[01:24:54.707 --> 01:24:56.228]  Go ahead and finish up, Jay.
[01:24:57.419 --> 01:24:59.581]  That's all I had for today.
[01:24:59.621 --> 01:25:00.982]  Hey, thanks for holding to play that.
[01:25:01.022 --> 01:25:01.743]  That was interesting.
[01:25:02.563 --> 01:25:03.424]  And yes, that's true.
[01:25:03.464 --> 01:25:04.665]  The Serbs didn't do anything.
[01:25:05.486 --> 01:25:10.030]  And they took Al-Qaeda and used Al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs when the Serbs fought back to defend themselves.
[01:25:10.530 --> 01:25:14.393]  The people that saved thousands of our troops in World War II and fought the Nazis.
[01:25:15.414 --> 01:25:16.295]  What did they get for it?
[01:25:16.335 --> 01:25:19.077]  They got called Nazis and they got killed.
[01:25:19.197 --> 01:25:21.699]  And yes, there was ethnic war and yes, they were killing each other.
[01:25:22.079 --> 01:25:24.041]  But if you look at the numbers, the Muslims
[01:25:24.975 --> 01:25:30.899]  And the Croats, those are the Nazis' buddies, were killing conservatively five times the Serbs were.
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:32.440]  Okay?
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:34.201]  And Milošević wasn't going to put up with it.
[01:25:35.022 --> 01:25:37.543]  And certainly he was a hard man and a bad guy.
[01:25:37.603 --> 01:25:39.664]  Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[01:25:40.025 --> 01:25:46.729]  But you don't send in Satan to take out one of his lower demons and then tell me Satan's good because he's stomping on demons.
[01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:48.730]  Can't we figure this out?
[01:25:49.671 --> 01:25:51.692]  Let's go to Kevin in Texas, and I'll hold him over, too.
[01:25:51.732 --> 01:25:52.293]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[01:25:52.933 --> 01:25:53.293]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:53.313 --> 01:25:54.414]  I hope you're having a good day.
[01:25:54.847 --> 01:25:57.690]  I've got a couple pieces of articles I want to read.
[01:25:58.511 --> 01:26:06.619]  One of them is called Staying Above the Fray, and it has to do with the Republicans from Texas in Congress, how they're kind of staying out of the redistricting battle.
[01:26:07.379 --> 01:26:14.206]  Anyway, it says, Only one, Kevin Brady of the Woodlands, would name a Democratic colleague he thinks is worth saving.
[01:26:16.013 --> 01:26:19.336]  Brady's been friends with Jim Turner of Crockett for 14 years.
[01:26:19.416 --> 01:26:21.777]  They met while each other were running for the legislature.
[01:26:22.558 --> 01:26:24.439]  Now they're in the same Bible fellowship group.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:26.581]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:26:26.961 --> 01:26:29.843]  We'll be back and let you talk about the Democrats that keep running out of Texas.
[01:26:29.863 --> 01:26:30.384]  We'll be back.
[01:26:33.046 --> 01:26:33.987]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.447 --> 01:26:36.048]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.969 --> 01:26:39.671]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:45.147]  As a doctor, you're able to cure and heal your patients.
[01:26:45.407 --> 01:26:48.010]  Unfortunately, there's more than that to a successful medical practice.
[01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:53.134]  Confirming appointments, rescheduling missed visits, and sending reminders is inconvenient and time-consuming.
[01:26:53.975 --> 01:27:02.162]  Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your personal ozone generator or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:28.478]  All right, let's go back to Kevin in Texas, who's, I guess, talking about how the Democrats continue to run out of the state to New Mexico and up into Oklahoma because they want to block redistricting.
[01:27:28.518 --> 01:27:31.981]  And a lot of people that think they're conservative have been against that.
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:40.305]  If you've read the Federalist Papers or the Anti-Federalist Papers or what the Founding Fathers said our government was supposed to do, gridlock is wonderful.
[01:27:41.026 --> 01:27:41.967]  Gridlock is good.
[01:27:42.027 --> 01:27:53.655]  We don't want states and cities and counties and the federal government and regional governments churning out hundreds of thousands, in some cases millions of new laws every year.
[01:27:54.996 --> 01:27:55.516]  No.
[01:27:55.776 --> 01:27:58.418]  I mean, for God, ten laws was enough, but
[01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:01.276]  Again, this is the new industry.
[01:28:01.296 --> 01:28:06.157]  They're going to graduate in the next four years more lawyers than are out there practicing right now.
[01:28:07.598 --> 01:28:09.658]  So this is a horrible system we're entering into.
[01:28:09.678 --> 01:28:18.661]  And I want people to realize that, that the government's growing, everything else is contracting, except for the wallets of the globalists.
[01:28:19.162 --> 01:28:20.702]  But, Kevin, where are you going with this?
[01:28:21.222 --> 01:28:28.865]  Well, it's a lot about the polarization you were talking about, maybe trying to make the conservatives bad guys, because in Texas it's portrayed right now as the
[01:28:29.264 --> 01:28:35.527]  The angry white, hate-mongering conservatives are trying to do something to the minority Democrats, but it's really not the case at all.
[01:28:36.148 --> 01:28:37.408]  And let me just finish this last part.
[01:28:37.448 --> 01:28:42.631]  It says, some proposals would shift Mr. Turner into Mr. Brady's strongly Republican district.
[01:28:43.172 --> 01:28:43.832]  This is Brady.
[01:28:44.392 --> 01:28:47.394]  I'm sick at the thought of being paired with Jim, Mr. Brady said.
[01:28:47.534 --> 01:28:52.236]  I don't think a fair map should remove every Anglo-Democrat.
[01:28:52.617 --> 01:28:56.939]  I just know I have good friends who are good congressmen who I hope make it through this.
[01:28:57.423 --> 01:29:00.326]  This one Texas Republican in Congress is officially neutral.
[01:29:01.066 --> 01:29:07.152]  Representative Ron Paul of Surfside, a former Libertarian presidential candidate, nothing we can do about it.
[01:29:07.332 --> 01:29:14.538]  Not our fight, said spokesman Jeff Dennis, adding only that it will be over soon enough and God knows when the lawsuits will start.
[01:29:14.598 --> 01:29:23.026]  But this is an attack on what we call the WD-40s, the white rural Democrat, kind of the old school yellow dog Democrat.
[01:29:24.724 --> 01:29:29.566]  You know, it's a pretty sinister little thing they're doing, and of course they're going to misrepresent it.
[01:29:29.806 --> 01:29:32.227]  It's run right out of the White House, Karl Rove.
[01:29:32.507 --> 01:29:35.088]  Oh, sure, Rove, in delay.
[01:29:35.328 --> 01:29:38.610]  And by the way, they want blanket amnesty for the illegals.
[01:29:38.650 --> 01:29:40.110]  They want the matricula card.
[01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:41.671]  They want gun control.
[01:29:41.771 --> 01:29:43.612]  I'm telling the Democrats they ought to be happy.
[01:29:43.652 --> 01:29:46.973]  If you love socialism and evil, you should love Bush.
[01:29:47.773 --> 01:29:51.855]  White people will be the Republicans, and all the minorities they're bringing in will be the Democrats.
[01:29:52.795 --> 01:29:54.476]  It's easy to see what they're setting up, but
[01:29:55.198 --> 01:29:56.519]  There's one other thing I wanted to mention.
[01:29:56.539 --> 01:29:59.981]  It's about a disillusionment grows in Afghanistan.
[01:30:00.822 --> 01:30:14.151]  It said, in Kabul, Afghanistan, along a pothole road in eastern Afghanistan, Mohammed John points through a cloud of dust at a line of mansions that seem to be out of place in such a poverty-stricken surroundings.
[01:30:14.631 --> 01:30:16.833]  This is where the new beautiful houses begin.
[01:30:16.873 --> 01:30:18.394]  They belong to the commanders.
[01:30:18.554 --> 01:30:20.455]  Their money is from the drug smuggling.
[01:30:21.024 --> 01:30:21.985]  They will never be caught.
[01:30:22.005 --> 01:30:25.588]  Their soldiers are working with the Americans, says Mr. John, an opium grower.
[01:30:26.529 --> 01:30:28.851]  They asked the question, was it worth it?
[01:30:29.212 --> 01:30:32.575]  But Afghans increasingly wonder whether the trade-off was worth it.
[01:30:32.675 --> 01:30:35.938]  Everybody says warlords, but these are warlords.
[01:30:36.338 --> 01:30:37.159]  They are commanders.
[01:30:37.199 --> 01:30:39.521]  They are the government ministers, says Mr. Ralph.
[01:30:39.942 --> 01:30:42.444]  We didn't like the Taliban, but there was security then.
[01:30:42.544 --> 01:30:45.187]  There were laws, but now anybody with a gun is the law.
[01:30:46.282 --> 01:30:56.129]  Well, for those that don't know, the Taliban and al-Qaeda was set up by the CIA and then flew those guys out to safety and re-upped opium production to record levels.
[01:30:56.690 --> 01:30:58.991]  In fact, there were just a few thousand tons coming out now.
[01:30:59.011 --> 01:31:03.775]  There's hundreds of thousands of tons of opium that's turned into heroin pouring out of the country.
[01:31:04.275 --> 01:31:06.637]  And, yeah, I mean, Tony Blair gives speeches.
[01:31:06.697 --> 01:31:07.637]  It's just horrible.
[01:31:07.738 --> 01:31:08.998]  All this opium's flooding.
[01:31:09.058 --> 01:31:09.619]  Bush does.
[01:31:09.999 --> 01:31:11.180]  My, it's horrible.
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:13.622]  They're shipping it in, people!
[01:31:14.378 --> 01:31:21.684]  There's a picture with the ad of the opium market in Ghani Khali in the Nagar province of eastern Afghanistan.
[01:31:21.724 --> 01:31:22.825]  You know, it's booming.
[01:31:23.586 --> 01:31:27.669]  It says the opium industry, harshly suppressed by the Taliban, has made a roaring comeback.
[01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:32.713]  United Nations say that production in 2002 generated up to 1.3 billion.
[01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:33.894]  Now, let's make that clear.
[01:31:34.054 --> 01:31:39.919]  A religious group took over the militarized Taliban, okay, and that's why...
[01:31:40.856 --> 01:31:43.806]  When the religious Taliban leaders were there waiting for America.
[01:31:43.826 --> 01:31:45.752]  Remember, they were the guys that offered to arrest bin Laden.
[01:31:45.772 --> 01:31:46.093]  Remember that?
[01:31:47.307 --> 01:31:49.888]  And every time they'd offer to do that, suddenly they'd get assassinated.
[01:31:50.448 --> 01:31:55.669]  Well, this one guy had warned them two weeks before specifically what he'd heard was going to happen, and he was there waiting for the Americans.
[01:31:55.689 --> 01:32:00.150]  He's the only Taliban religious leader held in custody.
[01:32:00.570 --> 01:32:01.470]  That's BBC.
[01:32:01.831 --> 01:32:03.531]  That's in Masters of Terror, by the way.
[01:32:04.271 --> 01:32:04.931]  That's a film.
[01:32:04.991 --> 01:32:06.652]  We cover that issue there.
[01:32:06.972 --> 01:32:11.113]  Well, you know, the new NYSE head is going to take a salary of nothing.
[01:32:11.133 --> 01:32:15.614]  So I wonder how long it'll be before he travels to Afghanistan to embrace the...
[01:32:16.485 --> 01:32:18.447]  Another regime there and see how he can help things.
[01:32:18.467 --> 01:32:21.770]  Oh, the new New York Stock Exchange person wants to have the job for nothing.
[01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:24.913]  Yeah, he's going to do it out of the goodness of his heart.
[01:32:24.933 --> 01:32:29.157]  Oh, but Tom Grasso got $139.5 million, and we got photos of him basically in lip locks.
[01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:33.781]  Looks like he just... We'll pay you with gold or we'll pay you with bombs.
[01:32:33.861 --> 01:32:34.462]  It's your choice.
[01:32:34.842 --> 01:32:35.563]  Yeah, he said that.
[01:32:35.603 --> 01:32:36.404]  It was in our news.
[01:32:37.907 --> 01:32:40.910]  But, I mean, it looks like Britney Spears and Madonna, him and Grasso.
[01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:42.231]  It was pretty icky.
[01:32:42.331 --> 01:32:48.536]  And, you know, right when he came back and the Fark wouldn't play ball, it was decided that playing Columbia starts up.
[01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:50.758]  So, you know, same old, same old.
[01:32:51.659 --> 01:32:52.279]  Have a good day, Alex.
[01:32:52.299 --> 01:32:54.641]  What do you think about all this assassination news coming out?
[01:32:55.342 --> 01:32:56.763]  Which one?
[01:32:56.883 --> 01:32:59.525]  Scott McClendon, the press secretary for Bush's dad.
[01:32:59.545 --> 01:33:01.567]  He says the government killed Kennedy.
[01:33:02.068 --> 01:33:03.128]  I used my one-liner.
[01:33:03.956 --> 01:33:15.825]  When it's got something to do with the household, I mean, it's more confusing than Father's Day at the McLennan, Rylander, Strayhorn, whatever other name she's added to her list of sires now.
[01:33:16.245 --> 01:33:17.887]  This lady's a black widow, man.
[01:33:18.927 --> 01:33:20.469]  You're talking about his wife.
[01:33:20.749 --> 01:33:23.011]  Oh, sure, the old mayor, the old comptroller.
[01:33:23.031 --> 01:33:23.871]  I don't know.
[01:33:23.891 --> 01:33:24.632]  What's her role now?
[01:33:25.951 --> 01:33:26.972]  The queen of Texas.
[01:33:27.072 --> 01:33:29.113]  The queen of Texas, Rylander, yeah.
[01:33:29.373 --> 01:33:30.233]  That's a side issue.
[01:33:30.253 --> 01:33:31.414]  People won't even know what you're talking about.
[01:33:31.674 --> 01:33:38.577]  I'm talking about McLennan, the daddy of the press secretary saying the government's killed Kennedy.
[01:33:38.597 --> 01:33:39.618]  I mean, he's got all the witnesses.
[01:33:39.638 --> 01:33:41.278]  He's a big-time Texas politician.
[01:33:41.538 --> 01:33:44.920]  One of her other sons, one of the twin boys, is running the FDA now.
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:47.841]  So, you know, they're getting their payoff.
[01:33:47.941 --> 01:33:49.402]  But anyway, Alex, have a great day.
[01:33:49.442 --> 01:33:50.403]  You're doing a great job.
[01:33:50.483 --> 01:33:52.424]  And I think we are winning, you know.
[01:33:52.484 --> 01:33:53.004]  It's just...
[01:33:54.743 --> 01:34:01.068]  Yes, Bush is bad, but there's more to the story here.
[01:34:01.128 --> 01:34:09.334]  Don't think that Kerry or Dean or their running mate Wesley Clark, the Rhodes Scholar and the UN puppet is going to
[01:34:10.171 --> 01:34:10.991]  Well, you know what?
[01:34:11.111 --> 01:34:12.192]  I hope it is Hillary.
[01:34:12.212 --> 01:34:13.873]  I hope Hillary wins, because...
[01:34:36.469 --> 01:34:42.451]  Then the conservatives can wake up from their little hibernation, from their little nap they've taken.
[01:34:42.491 --> 01:34:45.692]  The Democrats are pretty honest about what they always plan to do to us.
[01:34:45.732 --> 01:34:47.032]  They say they're going to take your guns.
[01:34:47.052 --> 01:34:48.713]  They say they're going to socialize everything.
[01:34:49.333 --> 01:34:55.315]  It's a lot less destructive than the wolf in sheep's clothing that we get from these neocons.
[01:34:55.975 --> 01:34:56.355]  I don't know.
[01:34:57.636 --> 01:35:01.737]  I think we're going to come to a point where they can play their games and they can say what they say.
[01:35:02.904 --> 01:35:10.306]  The vast majority of the common people of America that work and die and pay taxes are just going to start to boycott them.
[01:35:10.786 --> 01:35:13.907]  It's happened in other countries when the government's become so corrupt.
[01:35:14.428 --> 01:35:14.848]  I hear you.
[01:35:14.888 --> 01:35:15.768]  Thanks for the call, Kevin.
[01:35:16.248 --> 01:35:17.248]  Phyllis in Missouri.
[01:35:17.268 --> 01:35:18.189]  Phyllis, thanks for holding.
[01:35:18.209 --> 01:35:18.769]  You're on the air.
[01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:19.589]  Oh, hi.
[01:35:19.729 --> 01:35:20.409]  Can you hear me?
[01:35:20.609 --> 01:35:21.189]  Yes, I can.
[01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:29.732]  Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and this may sound far out, but I blame the United States Congress
[01:35:30.325 --> 01:35:32.867]  For everything that has gone wrong in the world.
[01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:41.613]  Well, I blame myself for not doing enough and the moral decline allowing criminals to get involved in feeding up the trough.
[01:35:42.674 --> 01:35:43.615]  That's history.
[01:35:43.915 --> 01:35:50.980]  So I blame our parents and their parents for squandering the liberty that was here in America.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.863]  These people determine what's going to go on in the world.
[01:35:55.904 --> 01:35:56.824]  They finance it.
[01:35:57.345 --> 01:35:59.206]  They see to it that it's executed.
[01:36:00.210 --> 01:36:07.495]  We've got to get him out on treason, maybe by all the illegal laws they find.
[01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:10.337]  It's got to be dissolved like Ron Paul said.
[01:36:10.717 --> 01:36:13.759]  If we can get rid of Congress, the whole world
[01:36:14.434 --> 01:36:15.295]  We'd be better off.
[01:36:16.736 --> 01:36:18.397]  Well, I mean, hold on, Phyllis.
[01:36:18.757 --> 01:36:19.998]  Phyllis, Phyllis, Phyllis.
[01:36:20.278 --> 01:36:25.462]  You know that Congress is a bunch of rubber stamps paid for prostitutes of the New World Order.
[01:36:25.762 --> 01:36:26.683]  But they're doing it.
[01:36:26.803 --> 01:36:28.525]  It's not the New World Order doing it.
[01:36:28.665 --> 01:36:29.585]  They are doing it.
[01:36:29.705 --> 01:36:30.006]  Okay.
[01:36:30.526 --> 01:36:32.668]  Do you understand what a marionette is?
[01:36:32.708 --> 01:36:34.049]  You know what a puppet is, right?
[01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.929]  Yes.
[01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:36.611]  Okay, well, it isn't Bill Clinton.
[01:36:36.631 --> 01:36:37.451]  It isn't George Bush.
[01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:38.372]  It isn't the Congress.
[01:36:39.261 --> 01:36:47.766]  It's the big tax-free foundations owned by the world money powers that print the money, the private families that print the money, that have the world in their thrall.
[01:36:48.786 --> 01:36:52.088]  And again, there's all these different bodies.
[01:36:52.148 --> 01:36:53.068]  It's not the UN.
[01:36:53.108 --> 01:36:53.969]  It's not the Congress.
[01:36:54.529 --> 01:36:57.911]  All these institutions have been controlled, dominated.
[01:36:57.971 --> 01:37:02.133]  It's not the Constitution's fault or the Bill of Rights' fault that we don't have liberty.
[01:37:02.373 --> 01:37:05.295]  It's our fault for not addressing it and being involved.
[01:37:06.499 --> 01:37:09.121]  Well, is there any way we can get rid of these people?
[01:37:09.161 --> 01:37:10.662]  Ron Paul said to dissolve it.
[01:37:10.682 --> 01:37:13.184]  To dissolve Congress.
[01:37:13.244 --> 01:37:13.964]  How can we do that?
[01:37:13.984 --> 01:37:15.405]  I never heard Ron Paul say that.
[01:37:15.966 --> 01:37:16.326]  You didn't?
[01:37:17.026 --> 01:37:17.487]  No, I didn't.
[01:37:18.808 --> 01:37:20.289]  I think I heard it on your show.
[01:37:20.329 --> 01:37:25.332]  He was making a speech and said that.
[01:37:26.193 --> 01:37:28.214]  I could be wrong, but I thought he said that.
[01:37:28.334 --> 01:37:31.656]  I mean, I wouldn't think of the word dissolve, I don't think.
[01:37:31.737 --> 01:37:32.857]  But maybe he didn't say it.
[01:37:32.897 --> 01:37:35.039]  But I just think that they...
[01:37:36.863 --> 01:37:41.025]  I don't care if the rich have the money.
[01:37:41.145 --> 01:37:46.747]  I don't care if the other countries do this or that.
[01:37:46.807 --> 01:37:51.249]  If you notice, all these things couldn't be done if it weren't for the Congress.
[01:37:51.509 --> 01:37:53.330]  And I don't care if they are paper puppets.
[01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.970]  They're doing it.
[01:37:54.625 --> 01:37:56.846]  Well, no, I mean, you've got a bunch of traitors in Congress.
[01:37:56.866 --> 01:38:02.968]  I mean, I understand what you're saying, but I'm telling you, that's lower down the strata of the power structure.
[01:38:03.008 --> 01:38:03.628]  Thanks for the call.
[01:38:03.828 --> 01:38:04.368]  Okay, bye.
[01:38:04.988 --> 01:38:15.732]  Yeah, the private investments of the Pentagon and the executive branch and federal agencies, they could operate on their own as their own institutions.
[01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:18.701]  They own most of the stock market, folks.
[01:38:19.322 --> 01:38:25.905]  The executive in the national security dictatorship is bigger and more powerful than Congress.
[01:38:26.326 --> 01:38:28.947]  Congress is a big rubber stamp.
[01:38:32.529 --> 01:38:37.212]  All right, let's go ahead now and talk to Gene.
[01:38:37.792 --> 01:38:39.693]  Gene, where are you calling us from?
[01:38:39.713 --> 01:38:44.956]  Yeah, Alex, I don't want you to get angry with me, and I don't want you to...
[01:38:45.635 --> 01:38:53.138]  You're too upset, but I've called to disagree with you, and I've checked my sources, and I've checked your sources, and we've had this conversation in the past.
[01:38:53.158 --> 01:38:54.159]  Who is this I'm talking to?
[01:38:54.439 --> 01:38:54.719]  Gene.
[01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:55.719]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:38:56.019 --> 01:39:02.782]  And, you know, I've called you a couple years ago about this, and I've rechecked all my sources, and I've rechecked all your sources.
[01:39:02.802 --> 01:39:02.882]  Sure.
[01:39:03.943 --> 01:39:12.206]  And I have to come to the conclusion, the same as urbanlegends.com, that this fetus eating in China is just an Internet rumor.
[01:39:13.323 --> 01:39:14.765]  And I know you're going to get angry.
[01:39:15.166 --> 01:39:16.027]  Yeah, urban legend.
[01:39:16.067 --> 01:39:16.708]  Let me stop you.
[01:39:16.808 --> 01:39:22.034]  Urban legend says that Kennedy, you know, it's an urban legend that there was more than one gunman.
[01:39:23.256 --> 01:39:23.516]  Sir?
[01:39:23.797 --> 01:39:25.138]  Well, there's other sources.
[01:39:25.158 --> 01:39:26.840]  Sir, sir, sir.
[01:39:27.041 --> 01:39:29.203]  Yes, you've called three or four times over the last few years.
[01:39:29.384 --> 01:39:30.545]  It aired on Channel 4.
[01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:37.412]  Okay, in England and in parts of Europe, the eating of a baby.
[01:39:37.472 --> 01:39:41.833]  That's been in the BBC, everywhere else, and there you are denying it again.
[01:39:42.113 --> 01:39:43.214]  Alex, Alex, I'm not denying that.
[01:39:43.294 --> 01:39:48.756]  That was Zuyu, let's get it out straight, that was Zuyu, a shock artist.
[01:39:49.036 --> 01:39:52.377]  He was a shock artist, and whether he did or didn't do that, I don't know.
[01:39:52.397 --> 01:39:53.177]  Oh, I thought you said he didn't.
[01:39:54.181 --> 01:39:55.142]  Well, I don't know if he did.
[01:39:55.242 --> 01:39:57.023]  I personally don't believe he did.
[01:39:57.083 --> 01:39:58.784]  I believe it was a farce.
[01:39:58.904 --> 01:40:00.805]  But at any rate, he may have.
[01:40:00.886 --> 01:40:04.928]  But that doesn't deny the fact that people in China do not eat fetuses.
[01:40:05.048 --> 01:40:07.470]  Do they have mobile execution vans?
[01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:11.072]  Let's not change the subject.
[01:40:11.413 --> 01:40:12.273]  I'm not going to sit here.
[01:40:12.553 --> 01:40:14.174]  The sun came up this morning, Bud.
[01:40:14.475 --> 01:40:15.996]  Look, I've researched it.
[01:40:16.096 --> 01:40:17.857]  People do not do that in China.
[01:40:18.337 --> 01:40:22.139]  It's not a custom of the Chinese people to eat fetuses.
[01:40:22.279 --> 01:40:22.679]  I know.
[01:40:22.719 --> 01:40:23.320]  I've been there.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:24.360]  My wife is Chinese.
[01:40:25.341 --> 01:40:26.802]  Half of my family is Chinese.
[01:40:26.902 --> 01:40:27.822]  I get to talk, too.
[01:40:28.683 --> 01:40:30.944]  I get to talk, too.
[01:40:31.844 --> 01:40:37.067]  Now, look, the Chinese government, and I have the nightline where they interviewed the people from China.
[01:40:37.754 --> 01:40:53.472]  The Chinese government has put out a book apologizing that during the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward, when they herded people off their land into the cities, that people survived by the large stew pots cooking humans.
[01:40:53.552 --> 01:40:54.834]  Are you saying that didn't happen?
[01:40:55.481 --> 01:41:02.606]  Well, I'm not saying that didn't happen anymore, that I would say that it didn't happen right here east of Reno when the people got stuck up at Donner Pass.
[01:41:02.706 --> 01:41:04.067]  Well, that certainly didn't happen, yes.
[01:41:04.407 --> 01:41:07.169]  Donner Pass, they eat people.
[01:41:07.609 --> 01:41:09.931]  Do they have abortions in China?
[01:41:10.671 --> 01:41:12.012]  Yeah, they have abortions here, too.
[01:41:12.993 --> 01:41:13.734]  Absolutely!
[01:41:13.794 --> 01:41:15.455]  I just said it's all just as bad.
[01:41:15.735 --> 01:41:17.556]  And people say that's America.
[01:41:17.896 --> 01:41:18.677]  Stop denying it.
[01:41:19.958 --> 01:41:23.400]  China has horrible human rights records, and so does this country.
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.020]  Yeah, I don't deny that.
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:29.102]  I'm saying the Chinese people do not eat fetuses.
[01:41:29.162 --> 01:41:30.123]  It's not part of their diet.
[01:41:30.183 --> 01:41:33.484]  I didn't say it was at every corner grocery store.
[01:41:33.704 --> 01:41:35.385]  No, it's not anywhere in China.
[01:41:35.405 --> 01:41:36.306]  It's not anywhere.
[01:41:36.326 --> 01:41:37.646]  You cannot go to a health store in China.
[01:41:37.706 --> 01:41:38.947]  Thank you for the call.
[01:41:39.087 --> 01:41:39.887]  I appreciate it.
[01:41:39.947 --> 01:41:40.508]  Bye, fetuses.
[01:41:40.568 --> 01:41:40.888]  Thank you.
[01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:41.388]  Bye-bye.
[01:41:41.408 --> 01:41:45.850]  I have actually had quite a bit of education on history.
[01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:47.491]  I've just read a lot of random history books.
[01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:52.752]  China, Asia is known for cannibalism during famines.
[01:41:53.392 --> 01:41:55.493]  There is a culture of cannibalism.
[01:41:56.034 --> 01:41:57.454]  So don't try it with me.
[01:41:58.175 --> 01:42:07.119]  Maybe you and your wife or your wife with her background of education in China, we'll just put it that way, loves the government, okay?
[01:42:07.799 --> 01:42:08.780]  I don't, okay?
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:13.122]  And people deny that they're, just deny whatever you want.
[01:42:13.948 --> 01:42:15.048]  They have forced abortions.
[01:42:15.088 --> 01:42:16.188]  They have infanticide.
[01:42:16.409 --> 01:42:17.769]  And there is the eating of babies.
[01:42:17.789 --> 01:42:19.109]  There's the eating of adults over there.
[01:42:19.649 --> 01:42:21.870]  I didn't say it was at every corner grocery store.
[01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:23.870]  I've got to keep moving on here.
[01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:25.550]  Alan in Michigan.
[01:42:25.570 --> 01:42:26.050]  Go ahead.
[01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:27.191]  Well, hi, Alex.
[01:42:27.211 --> 01:42:28.091]  How are you doing?
[01:42:28.471 --> 01:42:28.971]  Fine, thanks.
[01:42:30.511 --> 01:42:43.614]  Regarding the JFK assassination, I thought your listeners might be interested to know there's a link to a video clip of the two Secret Service agents that were supposed to stand on the back of the car being called back to the following car
[01:42:45.546 --> 01:42:50.051]  And I think a video clip is quite a bit better than a photograph.
[01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:51.652]  It's put in context.
[01:42:51.733 --> 01:42:52.894]  It's a lot harder to fake.
[01:42:53.675 --> 01:43:05.066]  But the guy that was supposed to stand on the right-hand side at the back of the car was called Henry Ribker, and he actually stayed standing in the field because he was so astounded that he was called back.
[01:43:05.627 --> 01:43:08.370]  You see him just speculating with his hands up in the air.
[01:43:08.823 --> 01:43:12.146]  They tried to make room for him in the following car, but he refused to get in.
[01:43:12.466 --> 01:43:14.167]  They killed President Kennedy.
[01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:15.848]  I mean, it's just an absolute fact.
[01:43:15.908 --> 01:43:16.609]  It's ridiculous.
[01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.989]  Right.
[01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:19.971]  I mean, the video clip, this speaks volumes, dude.
[01:43:20.131 --> 01:43:21.693]  Well, I mean, it speaks volumes.
[01:43:23.283 --> 01:43:34.467]  Folks, I mean, it's just... They claim that this bullet shot through two people changing directions 180 degrees twice and then laying on the stretcher with a small bend in it.
[01:43:34.947 --> 01:43:36.567]  I mean, you shoot a bullet into water.
[01:43:36.987 --> 01:43:39.208]  Full metal jacket, it's going to have more bending than that.
[01:43:39.268 --> 01:43:40.468]  It's ridiculous.
[01:43:40.769 --> 01:43:51.372]  It shattered people's ribs and heads and wrists and didn't even... I mean, folks, I've shot too many animals, okay, and gutted them, hogs and deer and everything else.
[01:43:52.232 --> 01:43:53.752]  I know what bullets do.
[01:43:53.772 --> 01:43:58.253]  If a bullet hits a little bitty bone, it disintegrates.
[01:44:00.154 --> 01:44:17.297]  And I think regarding the ADL's attack on Mel Gibson, it's easy to dispute their charges because all we've got to do is look at the statements of Carol Quigley, who was Clinton's professor, where he states categorically that there's an elite group that want to control us but don't deny it.
[01:44:17.317 --> 01:44:19.197]  It's all for our own good, and he agrees with them.
[01:44:21.313 --> 01:44:27.755]  Gibson has made a film that is right out of the Bible, and Protestant Catholic groups have seen it.
[01:44:27.935 --> 01:44:29.916]  There's nothing anti-Semitic about it.
[01:44:30.076 --> 01:44:30.956]  Jesus was a Jew.
[01:44:31.296 --> 01:44:32.097]  They've taken that.
[01:44:32.177 --> 01:44:32.877]  They've ruined it.
[01:44:32.917 --> 01:44:34.777]  They've tried to make it a dirty thing.
[01:44:35.278 --> 01:44:36.298]  It is disgusting.
[01:44:37.018 --> 01:44:42.600]  And now they're calling Mel Gibson an anti-Semite because he's mad at the ADL, saying, how dare you?
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:49.302]  And I knew as soon as he backtracked that one little bit that they would attack him more viciously because they showed that it worked.
[01:44:50.106 --> 01:44:50.607]  Absolutely.
[01:44:50.627 --> 01:44:51.267]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:51.287 --> 01:44:51.728]  Thank you.
[01:44:52.448 --> 01:44:53.129]  Yeah, it's sick.
[01:44:53.269 --> 01:44:56.292]  I mean, you know, I guess now if I say I'm for private property, I'm a Nazi.
[01:44:56.312 --> 01:44:57.834]  You know, I'm for mom and apple pie.
[01:44:57.894 --> 01:44:58.254]  Nazi!
[01:44:58.294 --> 01:44:58.694]  Nazi!
[01:44:58.975 --> 01:45:01.797]  We'll be right back, folks, with some final calls and final news.
[01:45:01.817 --> 01:45:02.198]  Stay with us.
[01:45:05.452 --> 01:45:12.015]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:45:12.275 --> 01:45:17.017]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:45:17.237 --> 01:45:22.900]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:23.881]  We're good to go.
[01:45:39.758 --> 01:45:42.259]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:45:42.499 --> 01:45:49.242]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:45:49.442 --> 01:45:54.705]  Order online now at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:54.725 --> 01:45:55.125]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:46:03.286 --> 01:46:09.668]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:46:09.828 --> 01:46:16.189]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:46:16.469 --> 01:46:25.231]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:46:25.451 --> 01:46:32.673]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:46:32.973 --> 01:46:33.434]  We're good to go.
[01:46:33.454 --> 01:46:33.934]  We're good to go.
[01:46:54.130 --> 01:46:57.831]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:46:58.031 --> 01:47:02.912]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:47:03.192 --> 01:47:06.533]  Are you tired of babysitting your slow-drying stackable dehydrator?
[01:47:06.633 --> 01:47:08.553]  Well, with an Excalibur, you don't have to.
[01:47:08.733 --> 01:47:14.494]  Made right here in the USA, Excalibur has been the world's highest quality, most versatile dehydrator for 30 years.
[01:47:14.714 --> 01:47:19.735]  Only Excalibur has a rear-mounted fan and thermostat for fast, uniform, and efficient drying.
[01:47:19.895 --> 01:47:23.216]  No babysitting required, just set the temperature timer and walk away.
[01:47:23.396 --> 01:47:28.539]  Dehydrate anything from fruits, vegetables, and meat jerkies to entire entrees for backpacking meals.
[01:47:28.779 --> 01:47:31.660]  Dehydrated foods are lightweight and use little storage space.

[01:48:00.006 --> 01:48:02.169]  Start eating healthier today with Excalibur.
[01:48:08.672 --> 01:48:17.338]  All right, we've got a bunch of callers holding a long, long time, and I'm only going to have time to take one more from Marcello in Canada here in a few minutes.
[01:48:17.358 --> 01:48:21.681]  Let me try to run through this, though, as quickly as possible.
[01:48:22.262 --> 01:48:24.784]  Wedding Unites Rothschilds and Goldsmiths.
[01:48:25.044 --> 01:48:26.445]  I didn't know Rothschilds existed.
[01:48:26.485 --> 01:48:28.126]  I heard of you say they exist.
[01:48:28.206 --> 01:48:31.008]  It's a code word that means you're a terrorist.
[01:48:31.048 --> 01:48:34.551]  I heard that there's actual government websites that say they don't exist, folks.
[01:48:34.811 --> 01:48:36.032]  The New World Order doesn't exist either.
[01:48:36.798 --> 01:48:38.319]  Government corruption doesn't exist either.
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:39.800]  Just shut up and go to sleep.
[01:48:40.221 --> 01:48:42.482]  Two of Britain's wealthiest families, oh, they're wealthy?
[01:48:42.523 --> 01:48:47.406]  I didn't know that either, will be united today at the wedding of Kate Rothschild and Ben Goldsmith.
[01:48:48.587 --> 01:48:50.048]  The ceremony takes place at St.
[01:48:50.068 --> 01:48:52.030]  Mary's Church in Bury, St.
[01:48:52.110 --> 01:48:58.535]  Edmunds, Suffolk, near the Rothschild family pile, where Schwarzenegger was last year.
[01:48:59.727 --> 01:49:08.032]  But despite the union between the two renowned dynasties being hailed by social commendators as the wedding of the decade, acquaintances of the couple say it will be a very traditional ceremony.
[01:49:09.253 --> 01:49:14.317]  Miss Rothschild, who is studying fashion, is believed to have designed her own wedding dress.
[01:49:16.318 --> 01:49:20.561]  The groom's father, the late Sir James Goldsmith, married his first wife at 21.
[01:49:20.641 --> 01:49:22.042]  It goes on.
[01:49:22.822 --> 01:49:25.664]  A pregnant teen's death under investigation.
[01:49:26.124 --> 01:49:27.365]  She was several months pregnant.
[01:49:27.385 --> 01:49:28.066]  They gave her R.U.,
[01:49:31.269 --> 01:49:32.229]  486, which they do all the time.
[01:49:32.249 --> 01:49:37.251]  You're not supposed to give it to somebody unless it's the day after pill, not the two months after pill.
[01:49:38.651 --> 01:49:40.112]  And she bled to death.
[01:49:40.672 --> 01:49:45.674]  Basically, it just dissolved her insides, and, well, that's the Houston Chronicle.
[01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:52.697]  Oh, boy, and by the way, your young daughters go into these places and they'll give them this stuff.
[01:49:53.197 --> 01:49:55.898]  But here, might as well just drink some battery acid.
[01:49:55.918 --> 01:49:56.538]  That'll help you.
[01:49:57.658 --> 01:50:00.240]  Here's the article out of the Harvard University Gazette.
[01:50:01.341 --> 01:50:03.742]  And this talked about a meeting about anti-terrorism.
[01:50:03.782 --> 01:50:15.631]  It says they shifted in the mission to saying that, quote, even aligning itself with neo-Nazis and white supremacists who were sympathetic to its new focus of fighting a new world order.
[01:50:17.312 --> 01:50:19.834]  This is what one of the organizers was saying in the speech.
[01:50:19.914 --> 01:50:25.998]  We know that Al-Qaeda is very, very good at finding people who have the right passport or speak the right language to facilitate an attack.
[01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:31.812]  And they go on in the article to say that now Al-Qaeda secretly controls everybody that's against the New World Order.
[01:50:32.912 --> 01:50:33.792]  It's a great system.
[01:50:34.032 --> 01:50:35.013]  I'm against globalism.
[01:50:35.053 --> 01:50:35.633]  I'm for freedom.
[01:50:35.913 --> 01:50:38.254]  You're with Al-Qaeda!
[01:50:38.574 --> 01:50:40.034]  That's code!
[01:50:40.654 --> 01:50:42.055]  I'm against troops running checkpoints.
[01:50:42.115 --> 01:50:43.635]  It's a violation of posse comitatus.
[01:50:44.075 --> 01:50:48.557]  The word posse comitatus is a code word for terror, not a federal law.
[01:50:48.577 --> 01:50:50.938]  I mean, just how dumb people are.
[01:50:52.758 --> 01:50:54.539]  And Mel Gibson's getting the same thing, folks.
[01:50:54.579 --> 01:50:55.079]  He's getting the
[01:50:55.823 --> 01:50:57.044]  Exact same treatment.
[01:50:59.104 --> 01:50:59.945]  Here's one out of England.
[01:50:59.965 --> 01:51:02.146]  500,000 children taking antidepressants.
[01:51:03.486 --> 01:51:07.348]  As young as 18 months.
[01:51:08.368 --> 01:51:09.269]  I'm out of time.
[01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:10.589]  I can't take any more calls.
[01:51:10.609 --> 01:51:11.229]  I'm sorry to everybody.
[01:51:11.249 --> 01:51:12.710]  I don't have time to take calls anymore because...
[01:51:13.982 --> 01:51:15.323]  This show is basically over.
[01:51:15.343 --> 01:51:16.504]  I really enjoyed this show.
[01:51:16.524 --> 01:51:20.367]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, and back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[01:51:20.947 --> 01:51:24.650]  Hopefully take your call then and have some more great guests and cover some more important news.
[01:51:24.730 --> 01:51:40.642]  I hope that if you want to learn more and see my ideas and information put in a concise, cogent fashion, you need to get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, my over-two-hour documentary about government-sponsored terror in September 11th and the emerging New World Order control system.
[01:51:41.405 --> 01:51:43.446]  And part two of that film is The Masters of Terror.
[01:51:43.566 --> 01:51:45.986]  My newest film is out, Police State's Retotal Enslavement.
[01:51:46.326 --> 01:51:54.929]  I have dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove, where I snuck into the so-called Christian conservative encampment where they engage in satanic rituals, which they admit I shot video of.
[01:51:56.069 --> 01:52:01.351]  You might want to get the new book, Order Out of Chaos, by Paul Joseph Watson that I've published, Elite Sponsor Terror in the New World Order.
[01:52:01.791 --> 01:52:02.751]  It's excellent as well.
[01:52:03.651 --> 01:52:08.753]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com if you believe what we're doing.
[01:52:09.558 --> 01:52:13.463]  Make a purchase so I can put out more films and continue what I'm doing.
[01:52:14.184 --> 01:52:16.506]  The toll-free number to get these great videos or books is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:52:16.526 --> 01:52:17.327]  Don't wait.
[01:52:17.347 --> 01:52:17.627]  Call now.
[01:52:17.647 --> 01:52:18.128]  Get in the fight.
[01:52:18.148 --> 01:52:18.188]  888-253-3139.
[01:52:29.281 --> 01:52:39.426]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[01:52:41.447 --> 01:52:48.651]  On this show, the conspiracies end, the documentation begins, a historical understanding of geopolitical systems.
[01:52:49.592 --> 01:52:51.733]  We're here to defeat tyranny and survive.
[01:52:53.996 --> 01:52:55.657]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:55.977 --> 01:53:01.720]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:04.541]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible.
